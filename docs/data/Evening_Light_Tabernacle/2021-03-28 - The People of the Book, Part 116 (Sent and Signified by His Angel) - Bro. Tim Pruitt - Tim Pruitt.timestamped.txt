[53:10] your own ambitions your own
[53:11] any kind of sin any kind of darkness let
[53:14] the lord just
[53:15] deal with you amen empty up so that you
[53:18] can receive a lot
[53:20] amen i believe that we're going to
[53:22] receive something very
[53:24] packed down and filled up and
[53:26] overflowing
[53:27] and speaking of that we are expecting an
[53:29] overflowing crowd
[53:31] and so um we have tried to keep this
[53:34] median not not really announced because
[53:38] we are just trying to keep the numbers
[53:41] limited but the good news is before all
[53:44] this even
[53:45] came into materialize in the meeting kim
[53:48] we had the governor
[53:49] uh lift all the restrictions on
[53:52] religious meetings so
[53:53] we can have as many as we can get in
[53:55] here amen
[53:57] and i just pray that the lord will send
[53:59] those who he for
[54:01] for ordained amen we're not asking for
[54:04] any more to come
[54:05] but we are saying that those that come
[54:07] we're we're hoping to accommodate them
[54:10] amen and we're looking for a good time
[54:12] in the lord
[54:14] my what a mighty god we serve when i
[54:17] think
[54:17] of what he's doing when i think about
[54:20] his healing power and how he's healing
[54:24] and the expectation of his people rising
[54:27] and when i think about the satanic
[54:29] forces and the evil that is
[54:32] coming to our country and to our land
[54:34] and the increase of darkness upon the
[54:36] earth
[54:37] it means that the holy spirit is lifting
[54:41] from the earth the bible said he
[54:44] that now let us will let until he be
[54:47] taken out of the way
[54:48] and of course he be in the holy spirit
[54:51] which brother branham said
[54:53] he even translated that is he or she
[54:57] be taken out of the way speaking of the
[54:58] bride because when the bride
[55:00] leaves she leaves as the holy spirit
[55:04] leaves
[55:05] you don't want to be left here you want
[55:07] to be a part of the ascending
[55:10] amen as we see a world that is falling a
[55:13] falling world of fallen nature
[55:15] fallen man we want to be a part of those
[55:18] that are ascending
[55:20] amen in your experience you should pray
[55:23] lord help me to rise up a little higher
[55:26] amen to you know to to um
[55:29] to move into realms beyond word that
[55:32] you've ever walked before and let god
[55:35] um take you on an enoch's walk where you
[55:38] take
[55:38] another step higher another realm higher
[55:42] this is a walk and so it is a step by
[55:47] step
[55:48] and wherever you are don't be don't be
[55:50] happy where you're at
[55:52] and some of you maybe came to repentance
[55:55] just the other day
[55:56] i'm looking out here seeing christian
[55:58] amen come to repentance the other day
[56:01] it's a great move
[56:02] wonderful thing good great move that you
[56:05] made toward god but don't stop there
[56:08] amen wherever you are in your walk don't
[56:11] stop there it's not a stopping place
[56:12] don't put a period keep
[56:14] moving amen and asking god to do more in
[56:17] your life
[56:18] amen i don't care if you've been a holy
[56:20] ghost field person for 50 years been in
[56:23] the message
[56:24] for 50 years and embraces truth asked
[56:27] god for a renewal of the holy ghost
[56:31] amen i have a greater expectation for
[56:33] more than what you've ever received
[56:36] the experience that you had to be a
[56:38] greater experience
[56:40] expect to see the angel of god
[56:43] expect to witness his presence expect to
[56:47] see the pillar of fire
[56:49] expect to receive the pillar of fire
[56:52] amen
[56:52] expect him to come and move over your
[56:54] life and separate you from darkness or
[56:57] sickness or disease or
[56:59] whatever it is come with a great
[57:00] expectation
[57:02] and we do that with every service ain't
[57:04] no telling what would happen
[57:06] amen and i believe that people are i
[57:08] believe our
[57:09] level of expectation is rising you sure
[57:13] realizing it's not
[57:14] time to play church anymore but it's
[57:16] time to really get serious with god
[57:19] amen and so you know i i we just had a
[57:22] man here this week
[57:24] that drove all the way up from indiana
[57:26] and came when the services with us
[57:28] because he's hungry and then he sees
[57:31] that there's something that
[57:33] that that you have that he doesn't have
[57:36] and he's a pastor of a little church but
[57:38] he wants more of god and i say
[57:40] glory to god for that amen may god
[57:44] move on the hungry hearts no matter
[57:45] where they are
[57:47] and stir those hearts and bring that
[57:49] bride to attention
[57:50] as i said you might have been in the
[57:52] message for 40 years
[57:53] 50 years whatever it's been you know
[57:56] that
[57:57] you don't get any gold medals for that
[57:59] be many of them left behind
[58:02] that started out and they they they
[58:04] relaxed and got
[58:05] cold and got indifferent got
[58:08] indifference toward god and that shows
[58:10] up in your
[58:10] your attendance to church your attitude
[58:13] toward christ your
[58:14] it shows up in every aspect of your
[58:16] christian walk
[58:18] so i'm just i'm just encouraging you to
[58:20] step up today
[58:22] and to look into the promise today we're
[58:24] going to be speaking on
[58:26] sent and signified by his angel
[58:31] if you noticed in the book of revelation
[58:34] it
[58:34] told us that he sent and signified
[58:38] or made it known by his angel unto
[58:42] his servant john if you look at that
[58:44] word signified
[58:45] you see part of it is sign
[58:49] is the first part of that word signified
[58:52] so
[58:53] that words it means that that it that
[58:56] there is a
[58:57] sign that is sent by his
[59:00] angel he sent and signified it
[59:04] by his angel you see it wouldn't do
[59:07] moses any good to go down and say an
[59:09] angel appeared to me in a burning bush
[59:12] unless he had a sign proving it it
[59:14] wouldn't do any good for william branham
[59:16] to come and say
[59:18] god met me when an angel of god stepped
[59:21] out of a light
[59:22] unless that there were signs that
[59:24] followed that proved
[59:25] that the angel was present now
[59:28] and so again it was is he sent
[59:31] and signified it by his angel and and
[59:34] the book of revelation
[59:36] was brought to john by the angel it was
[59:39] the
[59:40] revelation of jesus christ of sent
[59:43] and made known by his angel this is very
[59:47] important that you
[59:48] look at this because throughout the
[59:50] bible
[59:51] it was the angel that brought the word
[59:54] of god to the prophets
[59:56] the bible is god's inspired words sent
[1:00:00] and signified by his angel
[1:00:04] the bible would say um that the
[1:00:06] scriptures were written
[1:00:08] as the men of god were moved by the holy
[1:00:11] ghost
[1:00:13] so we have returned to the homeland this
[1:00:15] is what we have been speaking about for
[1:00:17] some time now
[1:00:19] the return back to the homeland and in
[1:00:22] this homeland
[1:00:23] of the bible it is a place where the
[1:00:26] word of god
[1:00:27] is revealed by the angel
[1:00:30] to the prophet amen how different we are
[1:00:34] from denominations who look to their
[1:00:37] headquarters and their schools of
[1:00:39] divinity
[1:00:40] as their alma mater you know almanac
[1:00:43] module is a
[1:00:44] latin word for blessed mother the thing
[1:00:47] that provides
[1:00:48] nourishment and so unlike denominations
[1:00:52] our
[1:00:53] alma mater is the bible and if we're
[1:00:55] going to understand the symbols
[1:00:57] in the book of revelation it will have
[1:01:00] to be made
[1:01:01] known to us by the same angel
[1:01:04] that brought it to john are you with me
[1:01:07] amen now we're not able to ask john what
[1:01:10] was it that the thunder's uttered we
[1:01:11] need to know we're here in the end time
[1:01:13] and john we need to know
[1:01:15] we're not able to ask him that because
[1:01:17] john we know
[1:01:19] has been dead long ago and so
[1:01:22] again but but the angel that brought the
[1:01:26] message
[1:01:27] is still here amen the mighty angel
[1:01:32] swore in revelation
[1:01:33] 10 that it would not always be shrouded
[1:01:36] in mystery
[1:01:38] in fact the angel has been seen in that
[1:01:41] scripture of revelation
[1:01:42] 10 is viewed with his hand
[1:01:45] raised toward the heavens and he is
[1:01:49] swearing with his hands raised up
[1:01:52] making a sworn declaration
[1:01:55] as he swears by himself for he can swear
[1:01:58] by
[1:01:59] no one greater and he's invoking by
[1:02:02] doing this he's invoking all the powers
[1:02:04] of heaven
[1:02:06] saying all of heaven is behind this
[1:02:10] that he himself is the guarantor of the
[1:02:13] promise
[1:02:14] that the time of the lame of this
[1:02:16] mystery
[1:02:17] is now finished isn't it wonderful we
[1:02:20] can announce today that we are no longer
[1:02:23] in the half an hour of silence with the
[1:02:27] time of silence where god held back
[1:02:29] mysteries of seven thunders and
[1:02:31] mysteries of those
[1:02:33] seals and its symbols and the mysteries
[1:02:35] of
[1:02:36] the church ages and the journeys of the
[1:02:38] church and god held back
[1:02:40] all of these mysteries but now
[1:02:43] the time of silence is over
[1:02:46] amen but we're in a time now where the
[1:02:48] prayers are being answered
[1:02:51] where all the prayers that were has been
[1:02:54] released by the pouring out of the
[1:02:56] incense and
[1:02:57] under the seventh seal when the seventh
[1:02:59] seal is open
[1:03:00] the incense is poured out upon the altar
[1:03:02] and mixed with the prayers
[1:03:04] of the saints no longer are they being
[1:03:06] held up
[1:03:08] about his coming john would say even so
[1:03:12] come lord jesus
[1:03:13] the prayers of the saints down to the
[1:03:15] ages have
[1:03:16] asked for his coming but we're in a day
[1:03:19] where they are now
[1:03:20] mixed with incense even when you pray
[1:03:24] for his coming today they are mixed
[1:03:26] with the incense off of the altar and
[1:03:29] they ascend
[1:03:30] immediately into god's presence because
[1:03:33] we're living in the age and the time
[1:03:35] we're not not being held up
[1:03:37] amen but it's a time where the prayers
[1:03:40] are now being answered
[1:03:42] hallelujah he is answering that prayer
[1:03:45] by reaching out and
[1:03:46] calling in the prodigal he is reaching
[1:03:48] out to prayer
[1:03:50] and answering that prayer by reaching
[1:03:51] out and finding the last predestinated
[1:03:54] seed
[1:03:55] he is answering that prayer by bringing
[1:03:57] an atmosphere of faith
[1:03:59] that will heal our bodies so we can
[1:04:01] believe in the chains of our bodies
[1:04:03] and god is answering prayer like he's
[1:04:07] never done in any other generation
[1:04:17] this is a solemn hour this is a serious
[1:04:21] time
[1:04:24] and he says he shows that all
[1:04:27] of heaven is now behind this promise
[1:04:32] he swears by him that liveth forever and
[1:04:35] ever
[1:04:36] a declaring an oath
[1:04:40] not going to stop there's not going to
[1:04:43] be any more delay
[1:04:45] i'm not going to hold this back for
[1:04:46] another age
[1:04:48] i'm not going to withhold from this
[1:04:50] generation
[1:04:52] the mysteries of god i'm going to make
[1:04:53] them known there's going to be a people
[1:04:56] that know their god and do exploits
[1:04:59] are you hearing me it means that there's
[1:05:02] no more delay you're holding back
[1:05:04] of the finishing of redemption i and the
[1:05:07] tearing off
[1:05:08] of the seals that held the book of title
[1:05:10] closed
[1:05:11] it's all over having a sealed book is
[1:05:14] finished
[1:05:16] amen we're in the day of the unsealed
[1:05:18] book
[1:05:20] amen i a promise closed off to us is
[1:05:23] over with
[1:05:24] amen because we are now the age we are
[1:05:27] now the generation for all the mysteries
[1:05:29] of god
[1:05:30] to be fulfilled in the people
[1:05:34] now this message did not come from
[1:05:37] seminaries
[1:05:38] or from the guesswork of men
[1:05:41] it didn't come by probing in the book
[1:05:44] his brother branham would
[1:05:45] illustrate it is not the mastermind of
[1:05:49] theologians
[1:05:50] instead god is his own interpreter
[1:05:53] it is being sent and signified
[1:05:56] by his angel now in the godhead
[1:06:00] explained brother branham talks about
[1:06:02] this
[1:06:02] because we we have come to a time where
[1:06:05] there's all kinds of
[1:06:06] what looks like contradictions and one
[1:06:09] man says
[1:06:10] us this and another says it that and
[1:06:12] they're built
[1:06:13] they have built denominations over every
[1:06:16] little
[1:06:16] frivolous things may not realize it but
[1:06:19] you know there is actually a
[1:06:21] denomination of the
[1:06:23] of the of the of the you know over
[1:06:26] whether adam had a naval or not
[1:06:30] all kinds of denominations have been
[1:06:33] formed
[1:06:34] sex pulling away ideas of man
[1:06:39] claiming to have the revelation
[1:06:42] are you with me but these contradictions
[1:06:45] come up and brother adam said but then i
[1:06:48] go before god to find out
[1:06:52] and the same angel that meets me in the
[1:06:54] meeting
[1:06:55] in the night is the same one who taught
[1:06:58] me the godhead
[1:07:00] all of these contradictions things that
[1:07:03] are in the bible
[1:07:04] things that are made known have been
[1:07:06] sent and
[1:07:07] signified to us by his angel
[1:07:11] so that you would not be wondering was
[1:07:14] this just another man's idea
[1:07:16] well is this just another man we are
[1:07:19] following no it is sent
[1:07:21] and signified by his angel
[1:07:24] you know why so why come back to the
[1:07:26] bible is taught by the angel of the
[1:07:28] covenant because
[1:07:29] it is the time for the mysteries to be
[1:07:32] made known
[1:07:33] in daniel 12 and 9 he said go thy way
[1:07:36] daniel for the words
[1:07:38] are closed up and sealed until the time
[1:07:41] of the end
[1:07:42] many shall be purified and be made wide
[1:07:46] and tried but the wicked
[1:07:48] shall do wickedly and none of the wicked
[1:07:50] shall understand
[1:07:51] but the wise shall understand so he
[1:07:54] tells us there is an
[1:07:56] understanding that will come in the last
[1:07:58] day
[1:07:59] that will purify the believers
[1:08:03] are you with me amen not only that but
[1:08:05] they're closed up and sealed
[1:08:08] until the end time because it's at the
[1:08:10] end time that this
[1:08:11] is all to come to pass and to be made
[1:08:14] known
[1:08:15] now you can figure it out how you want
[1:08:18] to but there has to come an end time
[1:08:21] there has to come a fulfillment of the
[1:08:24] promises
[1:08:26] amen you know he would come crying real
[1:08:30] slow but sure but
[1:08:31] they finally it had to come all of the
[1:08:34] old testament had to head up and that
[1:08:36] one man jesus
[1:08:40] and it's ground slow but sure through
[1:08:42] seven church ages but
[1:08:44] all the promises has got a head up in a
[1:08:47] bride
[1:08:50] are you with me now and down to the old
[1:08:53] testament it was always the word of god
[1:08:56] sent and signified by his angel daniel
[1:08:59] understood by books the number of years
[1:09:02] that jerusalem would be desolated he
[1:09:05] could go and read
[1:09:06] the bible and he could see that the time
[1:09:08] was near but
[1:09:09] yet even though he had the book he still
[1:09:12] needed the touch
[1:09:13] of the angel in daniel 9
[1:09:16] 21 yeah while i was speaking in prayer
[1:09:20] even the man gabriel whom i'd seen in
[1:09:22] the vision at the beginning
[1:09:24] caused to fly swiftly touched me
[1:09:27] about the time of the evening oblation
[1:09:30] and he informed me and talked with me
[1:09:32] and said oh daniel i am comfort to give
[1:09:35] thee skill
[1:09:36] and understanding now notice he had
[1:09:40] he had books he had the books of
[1:09:42] jeremiah he had a bible
[1:09:44] come on amen he can read the bible
[1:09:48] but he wasn't getting the full
[1:09:50] understanding
[1:09:51] he wasn't getting the full purpose of
[1:09:53] god until
[1:09:55] he got touched by an angel and when the
[1:09:58] angel touched him he said i have come
[1:10:01] to bring you this touch to give you
[1:10:04] skill
[1:10:04] and understanding this understanding
[1:10:08] would come
[1:10:08] not from the schools in babylon not from
[1:10:12] the
[1:10:12] chief of the nebuchadnezzar's team
[1:10:15] that ruled his ministry and his
[1:10:17] government and governors
[1:10:19] it wouldn't come from his educators it
[1:10:21] would come
[1:10:22] by the angel this church would
[1:10:26] illuminate
[1:10:27] daniel's eyes to things so he would
[1:10:29] write
[1:10:30] the book of revelation of the old
[1:10:32] testament the book of daniel
[1:10:34] he would record what the angel said
[1:10:41] now even in the days of jesus it was a
[1:10:44] logos revealing the word
[1:10:46] amen i said in the days of jesus
[1:10:50] it was still the logos the pillar of
[1:10:53] fire
[1:10:53] revealing the word the angel of covenant
[1:10:56] became jesus christ
[1:10:59] amen for the father the eternal spirit
[1:11:02] dwelt in the flesh body
[1:11:03] of jesus christ and it was the father
[1:11:06] the creator of his body that dwelt in
[1:11:08] him
[1:11:09] that taught him he was a man who can say
[1:11:12] i have been taught by my father
[1:11:17] my teaching was not a man he said in
[1:11:20] john
[1:11:20] 7 16 my doctrine is not mine
[1:11:24] but his that sent me in john 8
[1:11:27] 28 but as my father had taught me i
[1:11:30] speak these things
[1:11:32] he would speak things not of what he
[1:11:34] learned
[1:11:35] from his mother's knee not what wisdom
[1:11:38] he
[1:11:39] learned from man even they would marvel
[1:11:41] and say
[1:11:42] where did this man get this wisdom
[1:11:46] he didn't learn this from us it's
[1:11:48] obvious
[1:11:49] he don't agree with what we're teaching
[1:11:52] so he didn't get it from us but where
[1:11:53] did
[1:11:54] he get all of this knowledge and jesus
[1:11:57] answered that my doctrine is not mine
[1:12:00] but his that sent me
[1:12:01] as my father taught me i speak these
[1:12:04] things
[1:12:04] so the word the logos the pillar of fire
[1:12:07] the eternal spirit
[1:12:09] the father gave the message
[1:12:12] he was the same one who gave the word on
[1:12:16] mount sinai to moses
[1:12:18] he was the one who taught doctrine to
[1:12:20] jesus
[1:12:21] he's the one who gave it to paul
[1:12:24] as we've been through it in galatians 1
[1:12:26] 11 but i
[1:12:28] certify i guarantee you brethren that
[1:12:30] the gospel which was preached to me
[1:12:32] is not after man for neither was i
[1:12:36] neither i received it a man neither was
[1:12:39] i taught it
[1:12:39] but by revelation of jesus christ
[1:12:44] there in the presence of the pillar of
[1:12:46] fire
[1:12:47] in the body form that jesus is now
[1:12:51] because he's not here on earth in the
[1:12:53] body form of the man of galilee
[1:12:56] in that human form but he's here in the
[1:12:58] form he was in before he became flesh
[1:13:01] and that is he is here in the form of a
[1:13:04] pillar of fire
[1:13:05] and that pillar of fire would meet paul
[1:13:07] and teach him and he says
[1:13:09] i got this by revelation this man had
[1:13:12] never met
[1:13:13] jesus personally he had never been
[1:13:16] taught of him
[1:13:17] on the sea of galilee he had never
[1:13:19] entered into a fishing boat with him
[1:13:22] and learned of parables and
[1:13:24] understanding he had never
[1:13:26] heard from the lips of jesus like that
[1:13:28] but he received the gospel
[1:13:30] pure and true from a pillar of fire
[1:13:33] and he would write the new testament and
[1:13:36] he would say i
[1:13:37] certify you brother i did not even
[1:13:39] confer with the disciples
[1:13:41] i didn't learn this from them i learned
[1:13:44] this in the presence of a pillar
[1:13:46] of fire and you have a bible today
[1:13:49] that is written by the pillar of fire
[1:13:51] [Applause]
[1:13:57] in the presence of the pillar of fire
[1:14:00] that light who identified himself as
[1:14:02] jesus
[1:14:03] paul wrote these epistles of the new
[1:14:06] testament
[1:14:07] and it would be there he would divide
[1:14:10] law
[1:14:10] from grace it wasn't that circumcision
[1:14:14] was done away with it was that the type
[1:14:17] was fulfilled
[1:14:18] by the antitype amen that the true
[1:14:22] circumcision would come of the heart
[1:14:24] instead of the flesh
[1:14:26] it wasn't that the sabbath was done away
[1:14:28] with but that it was no longer a day of
[1:14:31] the week that you meet but
[1:14:32] it was now it was now a sabbath rest
[1:14:36] that you enter into
[1:14:37] by the baptism of the holy ghost it
[1:14:40] again it was
[1:14:41] not that the lamb and the blood of the
[1:14:44] lamb was no longer needed but now
[1:14:46] the greater lamb had come amen and so
[1:14:50] you know it would be paul who would
[1:14:51] write and he said this is
[1:14:53] better this is better than what they had
[1:14:56] there
[1:14:56] this is a greater prophet because this
[1:14:59] is the god of the prophet
[1:15:00] this is a greater than aaron because
[1:15:03] this is melchizedek
[1:15:05] this is greater than the law and the
[1:15:08] priesthood in the arabic priesthood
[1:15:11] because now we have a priesthood that i
[1:15:13] never die
[1:15:14] whoever liveth to make intercession on
[1:15:17] the behalf of those that seek him
[1:15:20] now that same pillar of fire that gave
[1:15:24] the message to moses
[1:15:26] on mount sinai taught doctrine to jesus
[1:15:30] and revealed truth to paul and he's the
[1:15:32] same one
[1:15:34] who restores the message to the last
[1:15:38] church age amen
[1:15:42] now we know there's been a fallen away
[1:15:46] the scripture bears that there would be
[1:15:48] a fallen away
[1:15:49] paul said it he said i fear
[1:15:52] that the church will do like eve and she
[1:15:56] will be deceived and beguiled through
[1:15:57] her subtlety
[1:15:58] through his subtlety and there she will
[1:16:01] be
[1:16:02] she will lose her virginity and john
[1:16:05] would pick this
[1:16:06] up and he would see her as a great
[1:16:09] a fallen woman come on
[1:16:12] a man who rejected her marriage and and
[1:16:15] being true to her husband and took in
[1:16:18] the seeds of other men
[1:16:21] somebody with me this is the great
[1:16:23] horror in the book of revelation
[1:16:25] because the book of revelation is really
[1:16:27] about two women
[1:16:30] right when you sum it all up it's really
[1:16:33] about two women the
[1:16:35] who started out the first eve who
[1:16:38] started out
[1:16:39] a man who fell away and amen
[1:16:43] god's bride who is a virgin bride
[1:16:47] a people without spider wrinkle and the
[1:16:49] marriage of the lamb has come
[1:16:51] for his wife has made herself ready
[1:16:57] to women we're in the times
[1:17:00] of restitution of all things
[1:17:03] peter would declare this when he would
[1:17:05] say jesus cannot return
[1:17:08] until the times of restitution of all
[1:17:10] things
[1:17:11] it's the time of restoration to bring us
[1:17:14] back to the faith
[1:17:16] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:17:19] now why not just allow it then to come
[1:17:22] through a trained
[1:17:24] revered theologian
[1:17:28] i mean you know they they have their
[1:17:31] skills
[1:17:32] they have their knowledge they have
[1:17:34] their ideas
[1:17:36] you know why not just let it come to a
[1:17:38] train revered theologian
[1:17:40] because they are the ones who mess
[1:17:44] it up with human understanding this is
[1:17:46] why we got the confusion today
[1:17:49] amen and it didn't take long when the
[1:17:51] disciples were all gone for them to take
[1:17:54] in
[1:17:54] and distort the gospel they were doing
[1:17:57] it even when
[1:17:58] paul was there and in fact he would say
[1:18:00] to the galatians
[1:18:01] he said who hat be with you
[1:18:05] amen that you depart from the truth to
[1:18:07] another gospel
[1:18:08] who has bewitched you he actually saw it
[1:18:10] as a bewitching
[1:18:12] evil spirit that had taken over the
[1:18:14] church
[1:18:15] of galatia
[1:18:20] he would see it already even even john
[1:18:22] would say
[1:18:23] ah the antichrist is already among you
[1:18:26] now
[1:18:27] paul would see it coming he said i see
[1:18:30] it as a man of sin
[1:18:32] sitting in the church in the temple of
[1:18:34] god
[1:18:35] and he's showing himself that he is god
[1:18:39] he's telling everybody that he's god and
[1:18:41] he's sitting in
[1:18:42] the temple of god
[1:18:46] he's a man of sin instead now
[1:18:49] now of course you know why why not give
[1:18:52] it to a
[1:18:53] trained revered theologian because
[1:18:56] it would break god's design and program
[1:19:00] of the way he does
[1:19:01] things amen he never has done it
[1:19:05] with the theologian ever
[1:19:08] he sins and signifies it through his
[1:19:12] angel
[1:19:14] amen now you know you can argue whether
[1:19:18] it's angels or not or whether
[1:19:19] angel ministries or not everybody knows
[1:19:22] that
[1:19:22] william branham was was a man who was
[1:19:25] accompanied by an angel
[1:19:28] he was set apart from all the other
[1:19:31] divine healers
[1:19:33] that he come along as impersonators
[1:19:35] after him
[1:19:37] he was set apart because this man had an
[1:19:39] angel with him
[1:19:41] amen this man every service the angel
[1:19:45] would show up
[1:19:47] this man every service the angel would
[1:19:49] heal the sick
[1:19:51] the angel would discern the hearts the
[1:19:54] angel would tell their addresses and
[1:19:56] their names and where they come from
[1:19:58] the angel was present in every meeting
[1:20:03] because while god was sending and
[1:20:06] signifying it
[1:20:07] by his angel amen yes william branham
[1:20:10] was an earthly angel but that was a
[1:20:12] greater angel
[1:20:13] that was with him that said that made
[1:20:16] him an angel
[1:20:17] or a messenger
[1:20:21] you cannot explain it any other way
[1:20:24] than there was an angel
[1:20:28] you can take his thoughts and say well
[1:20:31] they're distortions you can take his
[1:20:32] thoughts and say they were imagination
[1:20:35] but when you discern the thoughts of the
[1:20:37] entrance of heart like no man can do and
[1:20:39] only the word can do
[1:20:41] all of that goes out the window
[1:20:44] all your arguments fade away
[1:20:48] amen no you know
[1:20:51] it would break god's design and
[1:20:53] programming the way he did things that
[1:20:54] god
[1:20:55] used a theologian he sends it and
[1:20:58] signifies it by his angel
[1:21:02] now so you know it was theologians
[1:21:05] that turned baptism from the name of
[1:21:07] jesus to titles
[1:21:11] it was a gatling church theologian
[1:21:13] tertilian
[1:21:14] that changed the truth of the godhead
[1:21:16] into three persons
[1:21:18] that god that jesus was one that was in
[1:21:22] the godhead
[1:21:23] not as the bible said the fullness of
[1:21:24] the godhead was in
[1:21:26] jesus as brother branham said in the
[1:21:29] first seal i wanted to share this with
[1:21:31] you
[1:21:31] brother caylen singh shared this with me
[1:21:34] last sunday
[1:21:35] or last week after i preached here he
[1:21:38] said
[1:21:39] as we study this chapter we're referring
[1:21:42] different places
[1:21:44] but even the old and new testament alike
[1:21:46] because
[1:21:47] the entire book is the revelation of
[1:21:50] jesus christ
[1:21:52] that is altogether the revelation
[1:21:55] of the lord jesus the revelation of
[1:21:57] jesus christ
[1:21:58] it's god revealing himself in the book
[1:22:01] revealing himself to christ
[1:22:03] in the book and christ is the revelation
[1:22:06] of god
[1:22:07] he come to reveal god because
[1:22:10] he and god were the same
[1:22:13] god was in christ reconciling the world
[1:22:15] himself in other words
[1:22:16] you'd never know just what god was until
[1:22:19] he revealed himself to
[1:22:21] through christ then you can see i used
[1:22:23] to think years ago that maybe
[1:22:25] god was angry with me but christ loved
[1:22:27] me
[1:22:28] i'll come to find out it's the same
[1:22:31] person see
[1:22:32] christ is the very heart of god
[1:22:36] now can't you see then why there is a
[1:22:39] need
[1:22:40] because we have 40 000 different
[1:22:43] interpretations of the bible
[1:22:46] upon which men have denominated
[1:22:50] all of them taught by man and not one of
[1:22:53] them
[1:22:54] not one of them teaching paul's gospel
[1:22:58] amen so if we're going to have paul's
[1:23:00] gospel restored again
[1:23:02] it must be restored by the angel
[1:23:06] amen by jesus the pillar of fire come on
[1:23:09] the purify himself it can't come to
[1:23:12] human understanding of the bible
[1:23:14] it can't come by simply sitting down and
[1:23:17] doing a verse by verse study is gonna
[1:23:20] take a revelation
[1:23:21] from the angel or it will never become
[1:23:25] clear
[1:23:26] are you with me and brother brethren
[1:23:28] said it's by the help of the angel
[1:23:30] that the truth of this message was given
[1:23:35] amen speak to this mountain he said one
[1:23:38] time i written the bible about hell
[1:23:40] and i'm beginning to read the word hell
[1:23:42] comes from the word hades which means
[1:23:44] the grave and
[1:23:45] i was about three or four years i
[1:23:47] wouldn't preach on the subject of hell
[1:23:50] because one place it looked like a
[1:23:51] burning fire the next place was the
[1:23:53] grave
[1:23:54] until i found the truth of it
[1:23:57] and then when i got to know exactly what
[1:23:59] it was and by help
[1:24:00] of the angel of the lord that revealed
[1:24:03] it to me
[1:24:04] because i didn't get any schooling and i
[1:24:07] just hold on to a scripture and pray and
[1:24:09] search the scriptures
[1:24:10] until he comes and reveals it to me
[1:24:14] when he stands before me in that light
[1:24:16] that you see on that picture
[1:24:18] and reveals it it every time is perfect
[1:24:21] with the scripture through and through
[1:24:23] that's the reason i
[1:24:25] know it's the angel lord because he
[1:24:26] bears record of the word
[1:24:31] come on now church they made it don't
[1:24:33] bear record of a denomination
[1:24:35] but he bears record of the word
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:40] amen it agrees with the bible
[1:24:44] it doesn't matter what it is what we
[1:24:46] believe
[1:24:47] comes from the book written by the angel
[1:24:52] amen this is where it comes from this is
[1:24:55] where our message
[1:24:57] amen this was shown to the prophet of
[1:25:00] god in the bible
[1:25:02] he didn't use quotes of william branham
[1:25:04] to prove what he believed
[1:25:07] amen he used the bible words that were
[1:25:11] spoken by an angel the prophets down
[1:25:13] through the ages
[1:25:14] and that's how he proved what he
[1:25:16] believed
[1:25:20] somebody with me now and he said the
[1:25:22] reason i know his angel of the lord
[1:25:24] because he bears record of his word
[1:25:26] and if the angel told me one thing that
[1:25:29] wasn't scriptural
[1:25:30] i wouldn't believe him
[1:25:34] amen it has to be with the word first
[1:25:37] god's word is eternal
[1:25:38] it has er because an angel could come
[1:25:42] pre
[1:25:42] preach something else paul said it
[1:25:44] wasn't right but if it's the word of god
[1:25:46] the angel of god will verify that word
[1:25:49] every time
[1:25:50] to be the truth if it's a true angel of
[1:25:53] from the lord
[1:25:54] if it's something off of color then
[1:25:56] don't listen to it but if an angel comes
[1:25:58] and speaks
[1:25:59] and says just exactly what the word says
[1:26:01] then that angel is from god
[1:26:05] amen now so you see that's why he could
[1:26:08] talk about he said
[1:26:10] in the in revelation he said uh series
[1:26:12] he said what was
[1:26:13] being revealed what is the revelation of
[1:26:16] redemption
[1:26:17] how was we redeemed just look at the
[1:26:19] past few years
[1:26:20] and what happened the revelation of the
[1:26:22] name of the
[1:26:23] jesus in water baptism
[1:26:28] is that bible isn't it yes it is
[1:26:31] the only way anybody ever baptized was
[1:26:34] in that name
[1:26:35] amen the revelation of no eternal hell
[1:26:40] now there is an eternal fire because god
[1:26:43] is a consuming fire and he's eternal
[1:26:46] amen but no one will have eternal life
[1:26:49] in the fire in the lake of fire
[1:26:50] eternal life is only for believers
[1:26:54] it's god's own life immortal life
[1:26:57] so no one can burn eternally in hell
[1:27:00] they might burn a thousand years ten
[1:27:03] thousand years
[1:27:04] there probably will be degrees in health
[1:27:09] i mean there will probably be some that
[1:27:10] burn just ten minutes
[1:27:13] they didn't do much there may be some
[1:27:16] that burns a thousand years
[1:27:19] they'll suffer a long time there may be
[1:27:21] others
[1:27:23] until the last enemy is destroyed
[1:27:26] that's death and death and hell will
[1:27:30] find its place as hell is the grave
[1:27:32] there
[1:27:32] death and the grave will find his place
[1:27:34] in the lake of fire
[1:27:37] amen and the last enemy will be
[1:27:39] destroyed and that is death
[1:27:41] so you see there again he will he will
[1:27:45] watch
[1:27:45] he will be there watching all his
[1:27:48] subjects
[1:27:49] all his children all the ones that he
[1:27:53] deceived
[1:27:53] every to ever all of his kingdom come
[1:27:56] right down to the end
[1:27:59] come on you know it's well it's like
[1:28:02] manasseh
[1:28:02] in the bible who rebelled against uh
[1:28:05] babylon and king
[1:28:07] the king there took him and incarcerated
[1:28:09] him but he did something else
[1:28:11] he did and killed all his children all
[1:28:13] his wife
[1:28:14] everybody all his all of his leaders he
[1:28:17] took them and killed them before his
[1:28:19] eyes then he put his eyes out
[1:28:25] and the last enemy is going to be
[1:28:26] destroyed is satan himself
[1:28:32] and he'll watch every one of his
[1:28:33] subjects
[1:28:35] destroyed all of his children
[1:28:38] burn he'll see everyone that he deceived
[1:28:42] annihilated the soul that sin of the
[1:28:45] bible said
[1:28:46] shall die
[1:28:53] but he's going to die too
[1:28:57] he'll be the last he'll burn the longest
[1:29:00] he'll be tortured the most like manasseh
[1:29:04] there
[1:29:04] there they're watching his children
[1:29:07] die you'll be the last that's right

[1:32:52] wickedness is that's the one
[1:32:54] [Applause]
[1:32:55] that made the earth to tremble
[1:32:59] that did shake the kingdom
[1:33:06] that made the world a wilderness that
[1:33:08] destroyed the cities thereof
[1:33:11] and all the kings listen is this the one
[1:33:16] you see we're gonna have the last life
[1:33:23] might as well go to laughing now because
[1:33:26] you're going to have the last one too
[1:33:29] come on now amen the revelation of no
[1:33:33] eternal hell
[1:33:34] he said never was known before thinking
[1:33:36] your loved ones would be
[1:33:38] would be for eternal you can't have
[1:33:40] eternal life unless you're saved
[1:33:43] you've got eternal life then you can't
[1:33:44] be burned in hell
[1:33:47] for eternal you you can be punished
[1:33:49] you'll be punished for your sins with
[1:33:50] your natural life
[1:33:51] but you're not you cannot have eternal
[1:33:54] life in hell you've got
[1:33:55] eternal life then you cannot burn
[1:33:57] forever because there's only one
[1:33:59] form of eternal life and i'm sure the
[1:34:02] church
[1:34:03] understands that now what is it what
[1:34:04] other things a plan of redemption
[1:34:06] just look what's been given to us lately
[1:34:08] by the holy spirit see
[1:34:10] abraham seed what the revelation meant
[1:34:12] the serpent seed see
[1:34:14] the book of revelation watch when we get
[1:34:16] to it how it just peels off and i proved
[1:34:18] it
[1:34:19] by the scripture that's exactly the
[1:34:20] truth i go plumb back in genesis and
[1:34:23] pick it up and show
[1:34:24] when that seal opened it come right back
[1:34:26] through the bible from genesis to
[1:34:27] revelation
[1:34:28] and just think from genesis to
[1:34:30] revelation there was
[1:34:31] nobody baptized in the name of father
[1:34:34] and son and the holy ghost is a
[1:34:36] false baptism
[1:34:40] we're talking about things that was
[1:34:41] revealed by the angel
[1:34:45] it's not hard to see about water baptism
[1:34:48] even brother branham even said in the
[1:34:49] church these books
[1:34:50] don't require revelation it's so written
[1:34:53] plainly in the bible how to baptize
[1:34:55] because there's not one example in the
[1:34:58] bible where
[1:34:58] anyone was ever baptizing titles of
[1:35:01] father son and holy ghost
[1:35:02] every person that was baptized in the
[1:35:05] bible where baptism was obliged
[1:35:07] was baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:35:11] and the serpent seed has been from
[1:35:14] genesis
[1:35:16] people want to talk about the serpency
[1:35:19] what we believe
[1:35:20] let me tell you that was taught by an
[1:35:22] angel
[1:35:24] come on and the angel was there
[1:35:29] he knew what the sin in the garden was
[1:35:32] exactly right when he said i'll put
[1:35:34] enmity between you
[1:35:36] and the serpent seed you can't deny
[1:35:40] that there's a serpent see the bible
[1:35:42] said there is one
[1:35:44] i'll put enmity between you eve
[1:35:47] at the woman's seed and the serpent seed
[1:35:51] is that right amen so if the serpent
[1:35:54] seed was a myth so is christ a myth
[1:35:56] because he was at seed
[1:35:58] amen and so so is the church a myth
[1:36:01] see it's you can't separate the serpent
[1:36:04] out of seed and that's the one that
[1:36:06] really staggers them why
[1:36:07] they can't understand it because they
[1:36:09] don't have the revelation of it
[1:36:11] and he said why won't they come and
[1:36:12] argue with me pulpits open all the time
[1:36:14] i'd meet anybody
[1:36:16] i wouldn't argue with them but i sure
[1:36:17] discuss it with them if they want
[1:36:20] i i've asked them to come before the
[1:36:22] association
[1:36:23] i i i asked him right there before the
[1:36:26] association i want some of you to
[1:36:28] tell me where it's wrong don't stand off
[1:36:31] in the corner and talk about me about it
[1:36:33] come up to my face and stand let's have
[1:36:36] it real let's
[1:36:37] come up here and let's see who's right
[1:36:39] and wrong on
[1:36:40] but they won't tackle it frankly he says
[1:36:43] they know better
[1:36:45] cause not me but it's the holy spirit
[1:36:48] that very
[1:36:49] angel of god that you see what about
[1:36:52] these days here
[1:36:53] when all these things taken place and
[1:36:55] this age of the lord standing near
[1:36:57] i wouldn't know these things but it's
[1:36:59] the hour it's here
[1:37:02] and when we get through those seven
[1:37:03] spirits of seven horns and things today
[1:37:06] if the lord will and you'll see where
[1:37:08] it's at it's the hour
[1:37:09] that we're that these revelations are
[1:37:12] supposed to come
[1:37:14] it's the book of revelation the
[1:37:16] revealing of jesus christ
[1:37:18] and we find out the very first chapter
[1:37:20] he revealed who he was he's getting
[1:37:22] those seven seals revealing how
[1:37:24] he redeemed the earth one of them was by
[1:37:26] the name of jesus christ
[1:37:27] the other was taking the fear out of the
[1:37:30] people like eternal redemption
[1:37:32] um justification by faith the
[1:37:35] sanctification the baptism
[1:37:37] of the holy spirit amen like we sang
[1:37:40] today
[1:37:41] there's a name written in glory and it's
[1:37:44] mine
[1:37:45] but when was it wrote
[1:37:49] come on amen not when you come down the
[1:37:52] altar
[1:37:53] but before the foundational world he
[1:37:56] wrote your name there
[1:37:58] amen god chose you then i'm glad he did
[1:38:02] it because you see something i could
[1:38:04] have done might have
[1:38:06] got his disfavor and he would unchoose
[1:38:08] me
[1:38:09] but god did it before the world began he
[1:38:13] chose me knowing i was a sinner he chose
[1:38:16] me knowing my fault
[1:38:18] he chose me with my situations that i
[1:38:21] had to go through
[1:38:22] he chose me before the foundation of the
[1:38:25] world
[1:38:26] for i breathe the first breath he chose
[1:38:28] me
[1:38:29] and he ordained me to be an overcomer
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:38] so therefore we're eternally secured
[1:38:42] hallelujah amen taking all the doubts
[1:38:46] away from the people
[1:38:47] god wants you to be sure of your
[1:38:49] salvation
[1:38:51] if you've got the earnest of your
[1:38:52] salvation god has already sealed you to
[1:38:54] the day of redemption
[1:38:56] amen ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the
[1:38:58] holy spirit of god where you're sealed
[1:39:00] unto the day of redemption
[1:39:02] now listen many many things that we
[1:39:04] could talk about the angel
[1:39:05] the angel the angel the angel the angel
[1:39:07] revealed
[1:39:09] but let me tell you something even after
[1:39:12] this list of things that he just went
[1:39:14] through
[1:39:14] god wasn't finished that's right
[1:39:17] in the book of revelation there are
[1:39:19] seven spirits
[1:39:21] of god or seven
[1:39:24] manifestations of one holy spirit
[1:39:28] represented by the seven spirits of god
[1:39:31] there would be in our day are you with
[1:39:34] me
[1:39:35] supernatural things that would happen
[1:39:38] this is a time that
[1:39:39] heaven is opened
[1:39:42] that things from that from the
[1:39:45] dimensions there
[1:39:46] are happening in these dimensions here
[1:39:49] that heaven is coming down amen to bring
[1:39:53] a bride out of here so the seven mighty
[1:39:57] angels would come from glory
[1:39:59] representing the seven spirits of god
[1:40:02] notice when john saw the book
[1:40:04] it was a closed book it was sealed tight
[1:40:08] with seven seals but the lamb in heaven
[1:40:11] has moved by taking the book and
[1:40:14] loosened the seals in order to bring
[1:40:17] about the fullness of redemption
[1:40:20] so that there could be a rapture so
[1:40:22] you're living in a day where
[1:40:24] the angels of god are concerned about
[1:40:27] this generation
[1:40:28] about you living here in this time
[1:40:32] and he's come to touch your life
[1:40:36] amen in some ways every one of you have
[1:40:38] been touched by the angel
[1:40:41] maybe maybe not you personally but your
[1:40:43] family that's why you're here
[1:40:45] your mama your dad your brother your
[1:40:47] sister somebody
[1:40:48] was touched by that angel and came back
[1:40:51] and witnessed to you
[1:40:52] i have been touched and i have been
[1:40:54] given wisdom and
[1:40:55] understanding that i could not get from
[1:40:58] a denomination
[1:41:02] hallelujah amen
[1:41:06] the seals being opened in order to bring
[1:41:09] the fullness of redemption
[1:41:12] now what if we just had another
[1:41:14] theologian
[1:41:16] with another chart or just a
[1:41:20] book written by a smart educated man
[1:41:24] well first of all if he was from yale
[1:41:26] then harvard wouldn't receive any man if
[1:41:28] he was from
[1:41:29] this one loyola did at vinity college
[1:41:32] then
[1:41:33] he wouldn't be received by the methodist
[1:41:34] and if he had if he come from this
[1:41:36] and and god didn't choose any of them
[1:41:40] look at what he did he bypassed even in
[1:41:42] jesus day
[1:41:43] pharisees sadducees kings
[1:41:48] herod pilate
[1:41:51] all of these great dignitaries he
[1:41:54] bypassed them all
[1:41:56] and was born in a little shepherd home
[1:42:01] amen instead of kings like that witness
[1:42:04] in his birth which kings would come from
[1:42:06] the east
[1:42:07] but instead of herod and and pilate and
[1:42:09] all the
[1:42:10] other different ones and caesar's
[1:42:12] recognizing here he's recognized
[1:42:15] by the angels of heaven
[1:42:21] now but what if we'd add another
[1:42:24] theologian with just
[1:42:26] another chart drawn or another book
[1:42:29] written by a
[1:42:30] smart educated man
[1:42:36] in services is this at the end is this a
[1:42:39] sign the answers
[1:42:41] he said if if it says they believe jesus
[1:42:44] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:42:46] forever
[1:42:46] but deny his signs and wonders that the
[1:42:49] whole realm of nature believed on him
[1:42:51] and all the church believed on him
[1:42:53] by this how will we know how to prepare
[1:42:56] somebody
[1:42:57] has come forth with the chart and drew
[1:42:59] it all out
[1:43:02] and somebody has come forth another
[1:43:04] thing and drew
[1:43:05] this all out contrary to this one
[1:43:10] did you ever go into a bible book store
[1:43:12] that's well stocked
[1:43:15] and see thousands of books
[1:43:19] and this one's got his ideas on that and
[1:43:21] this has got his ideas on that
[1:43:24] and this is contrary to that and you got
[1:43:27] book up on book and shelf upon shelf of
[1:43:30] books
[1:43:31] to go through
[1:43:34] and then you have the charts of the end
[1:43:36] time
[1:43:38] charts of of how things are to be and
[1:43:41] this is our idea of how the seals are to
[1:43:43] be laid out in this
[1:43:45] idea idea of all of this we got it all
[1:43:48] done and this is contrary the other
[1:43:50] wrote books
[1:43:51] and then he writes another and it's
[1:43:53] contrary to that one
[1:43:55] but god comes in the power of his
[1:43:59] resurrection
[1:44:00] and who's going to speak against it
[1:44:04] amen and jesus christ is the same
[1:44:07] yesterday today on forever
[1:44:08] he does the same thing that he did
[1:44:10] yesterday today and forever
[1:44:12] and that's what the angels to do is to
[1:44:14] take them mysteries
[1:44:16] and turn them loose sins that then
[1:44:18] people run out on
[1:44:21] so again you see it was it's not another
[1:44:25] chart
[1:44:26] it's not another book to add to the
[1:44:28] libraries
[1:44:30] it's not another good man in his
[1:44:32] thinking
[1:44:33] it is sent and signified by his angel
[1:44:37] amen now again in the breach brother
[1:44:41] branham talks about this he said
[1:44:42] you talk about a jubilee you talk about
[1:44:45] a time when the lamb walked forth
[1:44:47] see the book's even sealed in heaven the
[1:44:49] mysteries are
[1:44:50] is my name there i don't know i hope it
[1:44:53] is but if it is it was put on the book
[1:44:55] before the foundational world
[1:44:57] but the first thing that's represented
[1:44:59] that redemption
[1:45:00] come along that had been slain from the
[1:45:03] foundational world
[1:45:05] and he took the book glory and he
[1:45:08] opened the book and he tore off the
[1:45:11] seals
[1:45:12] and he sent it down to the earth to his
[1:45:14] seventh angel
[1:45:15] to reveal it to the people there you are
[1:45:19] oh my what happens the screams the
[1:45:21] shouts the hallelujahs the anointing the
[1:45:23] power
[1:45:24] the glory of the manifestation
[1:45:27] hallelujah do you realize what we're
[1:45:30] talking about
[1:45:31] am i not a theologian not a man's idea
[1:45:35] not another chart but the lamb
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:39] trump the book and loose the shields
[1:45:44] and handed it down through the seventh
[1:45:47] angel on earth
[1:45:49] hallelujah and when they saw that
[1:45:51] happening in heaven
[1:45:52] amen what happened they began to scream
[1:45:55] and to shout
[1:45:56] and rejoice and if that's what they're
[1:45:59] doing in heaven
[1:46:00] what are we to be doing you're saying
[1:46:03] the lamb has opened the book
[1:46:04] the lamb has loosed the seal it ought to
[1:46:07] cause somebody
[1:46:08] to rejoice amen to worship god
[1:46:15] in the days gone by the voice of god
[1:46:17] thundered from mount sinai
[1:46:19] as the word was administered by an angel
[1:46:23] in daniel's day the man gabriel came
[1:46:25] from glory to reveal the
[1:46:27] divine plan in jesus day
[1:46:31] angels descended and announced in the
[1:46:33] heavens
[1:46:34] that this day in the city of david
[1:46:38] there is a child a baby born wrapped in
[1:46:41] swaddling clothes
[1:46:42] lying in a manger amen in our day
[1:46:47] our day is no less phenomenal
[1:46:51] i know days of miracles have passed i
[1:46:54] know days of angels is over
[1:46:56] i know it's all finished and it's all
[1:46:58] closed up
[1:46:59] that's what they tell us but that ain't
[1:47:01] what god says
[1:47:04] come on church if the word has got to be
[1:47:07] restored
[1:47:08] it has to be vindicated by god it'll
[1:47:10] have to be signed
[1:47:11] and signified by an angel
[1:47:17] in our days seven angels come from glory
[1:47:19] revealing
[1:47:20] the seven sealed book of mysteries
[1:47:26] feast of the trumpet brother branham
[1:47:29] says it this way the angels of the lord
[1:47:31] appeared
[1:47:32] and told about the seven seals that i
[1:47:35] was to return back here to
[1:47:36] jeffersonville and preach the seven
[1:47:38] seals
[1:47:40] and there if i ever said anything that
[1:47:42] was inspired it was that
[1:47:44] there where the angel of the lord met us
[1:47:47] and the bible became a new book
[1:47:51] wasn't the angel wrote a new book amen
[1:47:56] but the revelation of it made the bible
[1:47:58] a new book
[1:48:00] amen not the same old thing that come
[1:48:02] out of denominations and their ideas
[1:48:04] come on somebody but the angel lord met
[1:48:07] us and the bible became
[1:48:09] a new book there it opened up and
[1:48:12] revealed all the things that the
[1:48:14] reformers and things had left out
[1:48:16] it was complete revelation of jesus
[1:48:18] christ altogether new to us
[1:48:21] but perfectly with the scripture that
[1:48:23] was the word
[1:48:24] which has always been and i was so
[1:48:27] inspired
[1:48:28] and directed
[1:48:33] as he approached the first seal
[1:48:36] he didn't know what to meant he had
[1:48:40] preconceived ideas that he had
[1:48:42] learned of other men oh he was only a
[1:48:46] seventh grade kentuckian but he had read
[1:48:47] some
[1:48:50] he had thought you know that sounds
[1:48:52] really good
[1:48:53] that sounds plausible and he preached
[1:48:56] sermons
[1:48:59] on amen he talked about
[1:49:03] you know about that white horse rider he
[1:49:06] preached
[1:49:06] as christ coming that's what they all
[1:49:08] were preaching
[1:49:10] that was the understanding till the
[1:49:12] angel came
[1:49:15] we all had a lot of understandings until
[1:49:19] the angel came
[1:49:22] he was a man just like anybody else with
[1:49:25] understanding as a man as daniel said i
[1:49:29] heard but i understood not
[1:49:32] he was in the same boat as daniel was
[1:49:34] till the angel came
[1:49:37] somebody with me amen and he said i was
[1:49:40] there
[1:49:41] i would well i would absolutely today
[1:49:44] and i hope the people are spiritual
[1:49:46] but i would have a horrible
[1:49:49] i would have made a horrible mistake on
[1:49:51] that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock
[1:49:54] today when the holy spirit came in the
[1:49:56] room and corrected me on something i was
[1:49:58] writing down to say
[1:50:00] i was taking it from an old context i
[1:50:02] had nothing on it
[1:50:04] i don't know what the second seal is no
[1:50:06] more than nothing
[1:50:08] but i had some old context that i drew
[1:50:10] of something i just
[1:50:11] spoke on several years ago and wrote
[1:50:13] down and i
[1:50:14] gathered this context and dr smith and
[1:50:17] many great outstanding teachers i'd
[1:50:19] gathered and all of them believed that
[1:50:21] so i wrote it down
[1:50:24] that was the best people know they were
[1:50:26] probing at the book they were
[1:50:27] it was sealed with seven seals but they
[1:50:29] were trying to get a glimpse
[1:50:32] amen they were like they were like it
[1:50:34] was in daniel's day
[1:50:36] come on amen there was something was
[1:50:39] written
[1:50:39] but they didn't understand it i mean god
[1:50:43] had wrote it
[1:50:44] but they didn't understand it and then
[1:50:46] the chancellors and the great men and
[1:50:48] the teachers and
[1:50:50] and the wise men all come out and
[1:50:52] everybody guessed
[1:50:54] but they didn't understand it until a
[1:50:57] prophet came
[1:50:58] and when a prophet came what was written
[1:51:01] come on
[1:51:02] in mystery symbols now became known
[1:51:06] by the prophet to the people oh man now
[1:51:09] he can say
[1:51:10] exactly what these symbols were that was
[1:51:12] written by the finger of god
[1:51:14] god had wrote it with his finger but
[1:51:16] they didn't know what it meant
[1:51:18] till the prophet came because god was
[1:51:21] sending it
[1:51:21] and signifying it by his angel
[1:51:27] so then he would say here's what these
[1:51:29] strange symbols mean
[1:51:31] thou art weighed in the balance and
[1:51:33] found wanting
[1:51:37] now we know what it said because the
[1:51:40] prophet came
[1:51:41] amen because it was revealed to him by
[1:51:45] the angel
[1:51:47] it didn't come from his knowledge he was
[1:51:50] no smarter than the rest of them
[1:51:53] come on and brother branham same way you
[1:51:56] know everybody's guessing
[1:51:58] and he says about 12 o'clock in the day
[1:52:00] the holy spirit swept right
[1:52:02] in the room and the whole thing just
[1:52:04] opened up to me
[1:52:05] there was this first seal being opened
[1:52:08] and i'm as
[1:52:08] positive as i'm standing here that this
[1:52:11] is the gospel truth that i'm
[1:52:12] going to tell you about i know just know
[1:52:15] it is
[1:52:16] because if the revelations conjure the
[1:52:18] word then it isn't revelation and you
[1:52:20] know
[1:52:21] there's some of the stuff can look so
[1:52:22] absolutely true
[1:52:24] and yet it isn't truth it looks like it
[1:52:27] is
[1:52:27] but it isn't
[1:52:31] amen but because the time is near
[1:52:35] because we're in the end time
[1:52:38] god makes sure the end time people
[1:52:42] understand what do you say the wise
[1:52:44] shall understand
[1:52:46] there's going to come an understanding
[1:52:48] by the angel
[1:52:51] now brother branham would foretell this
[1:52:52] event by recounting a vision
[1:52:56] showing angels coming from heaven it
[1:52:58] came so fast that there were like a
[1:53:00] blink of the eye that was so fast
[1:53:02] he couldn't even count him were there
[1:53:04] five no seven mighty angels
[1:53:07] in the vision he he would he would see
[1:53:09] himself
[1:53:10] somewhere um close to tucson there in
[1:53:14] the desert
[1:53:15] and he would reach me reaching down and
[1:53:17] picking up a
[1:53:18] cockapoo from the cuff of his pants at
[1:53:22] that time there would come an explosion
[1:53:24] that shook the earth causing the rocks
[1:53:28] to roll down the mountainside
[1:53:31] remember when the first seal is open i
[1:53:34] heard as it were the voice of a thunder
[1:53:37] amen so it thundered there when john
[1:53:40] wrote about it
[1:53:41] it thunders again when it starts opening
[1:53:43] up
[1:53:45] amen and he said the blast sounded like
[1:53:47] thunder overhead maybe
[1:53:49] a supersonic airplane breaking the sound
[1:53:51] barrier we were
[1:53:52] breaking the sound barrier we were
[1:53:55] breaking the
[1:53:56] barrier of tradition the barrier of
[1:53:58] man's ideas
[1:53:59] we were breaking into realms unknown
[1:54:02] that had been previously
[1:54:03] unknown before and my god was breaking a
[1:54:07] people into a supernatural age
[1:54:09] into a supernatural time to make a
[1:54:11] supernatural people
[1:54:12] for a supernatural rapture
[1:54:18] now looking to the west
[1:54:22] he would see come in a pyramid shaped
[1:54:25] constellation of angels that were
[1:54:27] growing larger and larger as
[1:54:29] though they were coming at him at speed
[1:54:31] beyond his comprehension
[1:54:33] angels powerful beings with wings swept
[1:54:36] back
[1:54:37] heads turned slightly clothed in white
[1:54:39] armor
[1:54:41] and and he said and and trust him
[1:54:44] rushing for him from the edge of
[1:54:47] eternity
[1:54:48] they come at him so fast that he didn't
[1:54:50] have the time to count them accurately
[1:54:52] they were at least five no more than
[1:54:54] seven before he could blink his eyes
[1:54:56] they surrounded him and lifted him into
[1:54:58] their midst
[1:55:03] this is something that you only read
[1:55:06] about in the bible
[1:55:10] this is not something denominations
[1:55:14] tell you their leaders had
[1:55:25] this is something only
[1:55:28] duplicated or replicated in the bible
[1:55:34] this is biblical way this is biblical
[1:55:37] doctrine
[1:55:38] this is biblical pattern if it
[1:55:41] comes the other way now men
[1:55:45] would accept it more easily
[1:55:49] but it's not god's way
[1:55:54] you see men want to take it because it
[1:55:57] came with
[1:55:57] the accolades of dr so-and-so and
[1:56:01] studied bishop so-and-so and study and
[1:56:04] everybody with their robes on and
[1:56:05] their tassels on and their caps and
[1:56:08] whatever
[1:56:08] and they're going to give you the the
[1:56:11] the graduate party
[1:56:14] but that's not the way god does it
[1:56:19] god sends it and signifies it by an
[1:56:21] angel
[1:56:23] in the seventh seal brother branham
[1:56:25] comes down he said
[1:56:27] he said you notice one angel was
[1:56:30] was very notable to me he said it was
[1:56:32] the seventh angel he's to my left in the
[1:56:34] constellation the form of a pyramid in
[1:56:37] other words
[1:56:38] there were there were seven angels
[1:56:42] you know as as they were going up
[1:56:46] and and he said this one angel
[1:56:49] the angels took me into the pyramid of
[1:56:52] themselves
[1:56:53] the mysteries of god only known to them
[1:56:57] and they with the messengers that come
[1:57:00] with the messengers that come to
[1:57:02] interpret that pyramid or the message
[1:57:04] and the secret of these seven seals
[1:57:06] that lays inside the pyramid now i know
[1:57:09] that sounds like
[1:57:10] jargon but if you if we were reading in
[1:57:12] context it wouldn't
[1:57:14] because junior jackson had had a dream
[1:57:17] and had a dream that brother branham had
[1:57:19] been coming up the side
[1:57:21] of a mountain it was shaped like a
[1:57:23] pyramid coming up to
[1:57:25] an apex and he said as he was coming up
[1:57:28] on it he was
[1:57:29] he was identifying and you know and
[1:57:32] reading and interpreting
[1:57:34] the mysterious symbols on the side of
[1:57:37] that mountain
[1:57:38] and brother branham had been doing that
[1:57:40] he had preached the church ages
[1:57:42] we know now who the messengers were
[1:57:45] we know now they were ages we now know
[1:57:48] what they
[1:57:49] that that those uh some of them of
[1:57:52] desolate or distinct or unknown
[1:57:56] unmentionable places now today in time
[1:57:59] they have no meaning of time
[1:58:01] laodicea you might find some remnants of
[1:58:04] it some of the others a few remnants of
[1:58:06] it
[1:58:07] some of you can't maybe find anywhere of
[1:58:09] those seven cities
[1:58:12] are you with me they have no significant
[1:58:15] earthly significance today
[1:58:16] they were representing the ages
[1:58:22] and we come here to the last age
[1:58:25] and we can see now as he he was coming
[1:58:28] up inside the mountain in this dream
[1:58:30] and he was explaining all these
[1:58:32] mysteries and he gets
[1:58:34] up and there's something given to him
[1:58:36] from heaven some kind of tool
[1:58:37] put in his hands from heaven now let me
[1:58:40] tell you again
[1:58:41] i have to come from heaven no man could
[1:58:44] give this to him
[1:58:46] and he said on the top was this the
[1:58:49] capstone
[1:58:50] and he said it had to be opened up and a
[1:58:53] tool was given to me and my hand from
[1:58:55] heaven
[1:58:56] and he said i took it and i ripped off
[1:58:58] the top of that mountain
[1:59:00] and i looked in there and he said light
[1:59:02] had never
[1:59:03] shown this before
[1:59:06] and then it was a white rock with
[1:59:08] nothing written on it
[1:59:10] so it was a revelation but we don't know
[1:59:12] what it means
[1:59:14] it's a mystery but it's never been
[1:59:16] revealed
[1:59:17] light had never shown on it well there
[1:59:19] were seven thunders in the bible
[1:59:21] somebody helped me preach now
[1:59:23] that light had never shone on it had
[1:59:25] never been revealed to the church
[1:59:28] amen but those angels he said took me
[1:59:31] into
[1:59:32] that pyramid or that message of the
[1:59:35] secret of the seven seals
[1:59:36] that lie within that pyramid so he said
[1:59:39] there in that dream that was showing
[1:59:41] there
[1:59:41] i came to the place where light had
[1:59:44] never shown it but i'm telling you
[1:59:46] that's not our day light has now shown
[1:59:50] on that
[1:59:52] what was once obscured what was once
[1:59:55] held back
[1:59:56] what's what's what silence once which
[1:59:58] was unknown
[2:00:00] has been made known it was set and
[2:00:02] signified by an angel
[2:00:04] [Applause]
[2:00:10] now so the silence
[2:00:13] is now broken i'm so glad
[2:00:16] we don't have more days of silence
[2:00:20] there are those you don't want to go on
[2:00:21] said brother tim we're in the seventh
[2:00:23] seal in
[2:00:24] silence no we're in the seventh seal
[2:00:26] where it's opened
[2:00:28] and when you open it you open up the
[2:00:29] silence
[2:00:31] it used to be quiet don't what don't
[2:00:33] write this john
[2:00:34] seal it up it used to be that it was for
[2:00:38] seven ages
[2:00:40] until you had need to know it
[2:00:44] you know why because god was letting you
[2:00:47] know where you
[2:00:48] are where you are here in time
[2:00:51] let me explain it this way you walk into
[2:00:53] a park you look up here
[2:00:55] up on the side and you see the mouth
[2:01:00] well it's just anybody's guess is as
[2:01:02] good as yours as to where you're at
[2:01:06] you see a map but where am i at on this
[2:01:09] map
[2:01:10] is that right hey man this is this way
[2:01:13] it was i
[2:01:14] i went with brother george sometimes
[2:01:16] years ago we went down to florida
[2:01:18] and we was we were looking you know
[2:01:20] going down to his his
[2:01:22] mom and dad's place missed the highway
[2:01:24] he asked me get the map brother tim
[2:01:26] when we come to stop in the middle like
[2:01:28] get the map then you know tell me where
[2:01:30] we are i said we can't
[2:01:32] this map won't tell me where we're at
[2:01:34] what you have to do is go in that store
[2:01:36] and ask them where am i
[2:01:39] when you get the answer to that question
[2:01:41] of where i am i'll find that place on
[2:01:42] the map
[2:01:44] then i can get us to florida
[2:01:47] we were lost we didn't know what age we
[2:01:50] were in
[2:01:51] we didn't know what age what time what
[2:01:54] day
[2:01:54] what hour we didn't know we got 2 000
[2:01:57] more years ago
[2:01:58] we didn't know but what happened god
[2:02:01] sent a messenger and he put his finger
[2:02:04] on the map and he said you are
[2:02:06] this is where you're at you have
[2:02:09] now arrived
[2:02:10] at the last thing welcome to the last
[2:02:13] these little
[2:02:14] children because in the last days it
[2:02:17] ain't no mysteries anymore
[2:02:19] in the last range you'll know you're in
[2:02:21] the end time
[2:02:22] in the last age you know you're part of
[2:02:24] the coming year
[2:02:32] right in the fifth seal
[2:02:36] brother branham said i want to give
[2:02:37] thanks to him who's omnipresent
[2:02:40] and that today not knowing one thing
[2:02:42] about that fits seal
[2:02:44] it came in that same mysterious way this
[2:02:46] morning
[2:02:47] about an hour before daybreak when i was
[2:02:50] out in prayer
[2:02:54] he continued that just a little later
[2:02:57] and said dim revelations
[2:03:00] in the presence of that ball of fire
[2:03:04] hanging there in that room oh brother
[2:03:07] although i've seen it since a child
[2:03:09] every time it comes near me it alarms me
[2:03:12] it almost puts me in an
[2:03:13] unconscious condition you never get used
[2:03:16] to it you can't
[2:03:18] it's too sacred
[2:03:22] and the seventh seal as he's winding up
[2:03:25] the preaching of those
[2:03:27] seals he says now you notice the
[2:03:29] mysterious parts
[2:03:31] of this week that's what it is that's
[2:03:34] what it's been
[2:03:35] it's been not a human being a man it's
[2:03:38] been those angels of the lord
[2:03:42] again he said what it is it's been the
[2:03:45] holy spirit
[2:03:46] sending down these messengers and
[2:03:48] they've been revealing it to us
[2:03:50] and then notice how it's dovetailed with
[2:03:53] the word
[2:03:54] exactly
[2:03:57] and then he says again in the seventh
[2:03:59] seal to let you know this the truth he
[2:04:01] foretold it about two months
[2:04:03] or more before it was ever happened but
[2:04:05] that when i went west not knowing it
[2:04:07] come back here with the interpretation
[2:04:10] as he's given it
[2:04:11] now remember in the in the um
[2:04:14] vision he never told me one thing in
[2:04:18] uh in the vision when he took me up i
[2:04:20] was scared afraid i was going to die
[2:04:22] be killed in an explosion you see they
[2:04:24] could not do it the
[2:04:26] interpretation came just as i had need
[2:04:28] of it that was in the room
[2:04:29] i gave it out just as he give it now
[2:04:31] friends
[2:04:33] visions don't fail they're perfect
[2:04:37] they're just
[2:04:38] exactly truth now the vision
[2:04:41] plus the word plus history
[2:04:44] plus the church ages and all blended
[2:04:47] together
[2:04:47] so i could truly say to the best of my
[2:04:50] understanding and according to the word
[2:04:52] of god the vision and the revelation
[2:04:54] and interpretation thereof it is thus
[2:04:58] saith the lord
[2:05:04] what a blessed people you are that's
[2:05:06] heard from god
[2:05:09] not from man god
[2:05:12] in the unveiling of god he said and
[2:05:14] think of it the same pillar of fire
[2:05:16] they come there come upon those men that
[2:05:19] wrote the bible is the same pillar of
[2:05:21] fire today
[2:05:22] here today interpreted in the bible
[2:05:25] amen and i'll tell you we thank him for
[2:05:27] that same what a comfort
[2:05:29] what an identification i'm so glad to be
[2:05:32] identified in that
[2:05:33] i don't know what i do i i'd rather be
[2:05:35] identified in that
[2:05:37] than all the baptists methodists
[2:05:39] presbyterian
[2:05:40] lutheran all the rest of them identified
[2:05:44] in that word where that's your kind of
[2:05:45] glory
[2:05:46] and revelation rays hallelujah
[2:05:49] that's why we're not identified
[2:05:53] in baptist methodist presbyterian
[2:05:55] pentecostal any of them
[2:05:57] we're identified in the word
[2:06:00] amen where that's the kind of glory and
[2:06:03] revelation ladies where
[2:06:04] that same pillar of fire that came up on
[2:06:06] those men that
[2:06:07] wrote the bible is the same pillar fight
[2:06:10] here interpreting the bible
[2:06:14] you say well i think well wait a minute
[2:06:17] is your wisdom greater than the angel
[2:06:21] well i believe well what do you believe
[2:06:23] if they don't agree with this angel
[2:06:25] it ain't the word that's right well i
[2:06:28] don't think it matters
[2:06:30] brother tim but what did the angel say
[2:06:36] you see what's the problem is
[2:06:39] is there's too many people around that
[2:06:41] hadn't been touched by the angels
[2:06:46] you got to get away from your traditions
[2:06:49] you're hearing tradition
[2:06:51] you're hearing them you're hearing these
[2:06:52] voices it don't matter
[2:06:54] oh that that ain't the way the world
[2:06:56] does i mean come on that's archaic
[2:06:58] oh look at this you know you're stupid
[2:07:00] to believe like that
[2:07:01] i mean come on you know the educated and
[2:07:03] the smart and
[2:07:04] the intelligent the girls at work and
[2:07:07] all of this and
[2:07:08] everybody else and your peers and so
[2:07:10] they got all of this
[2:07:11] understanding and all this knowledge
[2:07:14] where did they get it from
[2:07:21] it's a tradition it's their ideas
[2:07:26] say brother them these are your ideas no
[2:07:28] they're not
[2:07:29] you say they're william branham's idea
[2:07:31] no they're not
[2:07:32] these came from an angel
[2:07:40] now you've got to get away from your
[2:07:43] traditions of i'm a methodist
[2:07:45] or presbyterian or oneness brother
[2:07:48] branham would say
[2:07:49] he said let the angel get a hold of you
[2:07:52] one time
[2:07:54] the angel of the lord that'll bring you
[2:07:56] the truth of the message
[2:07:58] let it get ahold of you one time and
[2:08:00] you'll humble down
[2:08:02] to the baptism in jesus name you'll
[2:08:05] humble down to right to all the rest of
[2:08:07] it
[2:08:07] yes you will you shall you'll forget all
[2:08:10] of these intellectuals
[2:08:12] and i'll tell you what if you ever get
[2:08:15] touched by the angel
[2:08:17] you will never be the same the bible
[2:08:21] will be a new
[2:08:22] book to you and what you believe will
[2:08:25] not be your own ideas it will have come
[2:08:28] from the angel
[2:08:30] amen because only the angel is right
[2:08:34] god is his own interpreter you know what
[2:08:38] god means this and i don't think god
[2:08:40] listen but what did god say about it
[2:08:44] amen the bible said he cannot deny
[2:08:46] himself second timothy 2 13
[2:08:48] if we believe not yet he abideth
[2:08:50] faithful
[2:08:52] he cannot deny himself doesn't matter
[2:08:55] whether you believe it or not god's
[2:08:57] going to be faithful to his word
[2:08:59] you can disagree and fall away and do
[2:09:01] whatever he's going to have a rapture
[2:09:03] anyhow
[2:09:04] he'll have a people without spot or
[2:09:06] wrinkle without a blemish
[2:09:08] come on he'll have a people who are
[2:09:10] chains he'll have a people who are
[2:09:12] touched by the angel
[2:09:13] a people who know their god who does
[2:09:16] exploits
[2:09:19] this is why you know you can't have the
[2:09:22] holy ghost
[2:09:23] and do things contrary to the word
[2:09:26] you know you you can't you argue against
[2:09:28] holiness you argue against
[2:09:30] bible doctrine bible principles and you
[2:09:33] know
[2:09:33] and if you argue you know against
[2:09:35] assembling yourselves together
[2:09:37] you make all of these arguments
[2:09:46] and that's the very evidence you don't
[2:09:48] have him
[2:09:51] amen because because again if you ever
[2:09:55] get
[2:09:55] touched by the angel you will humble
[2:09:58] yourself
[2:09:58] down to its truth are you with me now
[2:10:03] am i now brother branham would he have
[2:10:05] to do the same thing
[2:10:06] he had to lay down his own ideas
[2:10:10] he had to lay down previous sermons he
[2:10:12] couldn't just say
[2:10:13] now i'm just going to stick with what
[2:10:15] i've always known
[2:10:17] he had to change and you have to change
[2:10:21] too
[2:10:23] about any argument anything that comes
[2:10:26] up against the word of god
[2:10:28] you gotta you gotta change to fit the
[2:10:30] word
[2:10:31] because you've got to determine the word
[2:10:33] is right
[2:10:35] maybe i don't understand it maybe i
[2:10:37] can't put it together maybe it even goes
[2:10:39] against science
[2:10:40] may it goes against knowledge of man
[2:10:43] maybe it comes against what
[2:10:44] men's ideas are about this what the
[2:10:47] learned scholars said and this and that
[2:10:48] but if god said it you can stick your
[2:10:52] soul on hey mouth
[2:10:57] now brother branham himself would talk
[2:11:01] about
[2:11:02] things that he thought sounded real good
[2:11:05] to him
[2:11:07] and he said he tells about a
[2:11:09] conversation that he had with
[2:11:11] a man he calls dr lee vale
[2:11:15] and he said he asked me one time what i
[2:11:17] thought the initial evidence of the holy
[2:11:18] ghost was and
[2:11:20] wasn't speaking in tongues and this has
[2:11:21] been many years ago and i said
[2:11:23] no i can't see that and he said neither
[2:11:26] do i
[2:11:28] though i've been taught that so what
[2:11:30] would you think would be an evidence
[2:11:33] and he said the most perfect evidence i
[2:11:36] can think of his
[2:11:38] love and we got talking about that and i
[2:11:42] thought that sounded pretty good
[2:11:44] so i just held to that if a man's got
[2:11:46] love
[2:11:49] but one day in a vision
[2:11:52] the lord in a vision straightened me out
[2:11:56] and he said that the evidence of the
[2:11:58] spirit was those
[2:12:00] who could receive the word neither
[2:12:03] love nor speaking in tongues but it's
[2:12:05] receiving
[2:12:06] the word and he says
[2:12:10] dr vale said well that's scriptural
[2:12:11] because john 14
[2:12:13] when he the holy ghost is come upon you
[2:12:15] he will reveal those things
[2:12:17] to you that i've taught you and will
[2:12:19] show you things to come that's
[2:12:20] john 14 26 this is the evidence of the
[2:12:24] holy ghost according to jesus himself
[2:12:26] but the comforter which is the holy
[2:12:28] ghost
[2:12:29] whom the father will send it by name he
[2:12:32] will
[2:12:32] teach you all things and will bring to
[2:12:36] all things he remembers
[2:12:38] whatsoever i said unto you
[2:12:41] this is the evidence of the indwelling
[2:12:44] spirit of god
[2:12:45] amen amen what will he do he will
[2:12:48] teach you all things
[2:12:51] amen he'll be your guide he'll be your
[2:12:54] leader
[2:12:55] he'll tell you when you're wrong he'll
[2:12:57] correct you when you're wrong
[2:12:59] amen he will convince you of sin when
[2:13:02] the holy ghost comes he will
[2:13:04] not let you live in sin he will convince
[2:13:07] you of sins and that's wrong repent of
[2:13:09] it
[2:13:10] amen that's the evidence of the
[2:13:12] indwelling spirit
[2:13:13] and he'll bring all things do you
[2:13:15] remember whatever thing i've said unto
[2:13:18] you
[2:13:18] in other words when you face the
[2:13:20] temptation you'll bring the word right
[2:13:22] up front
[2:13:30] so it's receiving the word
[2:13:34] now some men have taken that and reduced
[2:13:37] the baptism of holy ghost to just a mere
[2:13:40] confession
[2:13:42] of the word i've received the message
[2:13:46] i embrace his truth i receive the holy
[2:13:49] ghost when
[2:13:50] i believe the message now that's not
[2:13:53] message doctrine is taught by the angel
[2:13:55] that's baptist doctrine
[2:13:59] baptist doctrine is will you receive the
[2:14:01] holy ghost when you believe
[2:14:04] no wonder people can lie still
[2:14:08] do people dirty
[2:14:12] amen pull dirty conniving
[2:14:16] calculating unfair business deals
[2:14:21] all the while claiming to be filled with
[2:14:23] the holy ghost
[2:14:24] because they've embraced the doctrines
[2:14:27] of the message
[2:14:30] because they would say well i received
[2:14:33] it i say it's true
[2:14:36] and yet you see they
[2:14:40] have never received the holy ghost since
[2:14:42] they believed
[2:14:45] they believed and they say the message
[2:14:47] is true
[2:14:48] but it's never changed their life
[2:14:52] no wonder then we have people claiming
[2:14:54] to have the holy ghost
[2:14:56] in the message who can look in
[2:14:58] pornography
[2:15:01] they claim they're receiving the word
[2:15:03] while they're receiving pornography
[2:15:06] also
[2:15:12] now well but we receive the holy ghost
[2:15:15] when we believe the message i wonder
[2:15:18] if you have received this word then
[2:15:21] let's go to acts 19 1. paul having
[2:15:23] passed through the upper coast
[2:15:24] came to ephesus finding certain
[2:15:26] disciples
[2:15:27] he said unto them have you received the
[2:15:29] holy ghost since you believed
[2:15:34] now so so again in verse 2 he says
[2:15:38] we have not so much as heard
[2:15:41] that there be any holy ghost
[2:15:45] and he asked him well how was he
[2:15:46] baptized and they had been baptized in
[2:15:48] the name of jesus christ
[2:15:50] the sacrificed lamb they wasn't
[2:15:51] identified with him at all they just
[2:15:53] believed like the medicines
[2:15:55] being there but they hadn't took it and
[2:15:57] paul commanded them to be baptized over
[2:15:59] again
[2:16:00] in the name of jesus christ right
[2:16:03] verse 6 and when paul laid his hands
[2:16:06] upon them the holy ghost came on them
[2:16:07] and they what
[2:16:12] they spake with tongues and prophesied
[2:16:17] so i wonder if you've received this word
[2:16:20] as brother branham said in the token and
[2:16:23] when he did this the token came upon
[2:16:25] them
[2:16:26] and they were identified by the works
[2:16:28] and signs of the holy ghost
[2:16:30] speaking in tongues through them and
[2:16:31] prophesying and magnifying god they were
[2:16:34] identified
[2:16:35] as with their sacrifice this is why he
[2:16:38] was like don't just come this far and
[2:16:40] say
[2:16:41] i believe the message you obey the
[2:16:43] messenger
[2:16:44] coming to christ that's the obedience
[2:16:47] god wants you to obey the messenger
[2:16:49] coming to christ
[2:16:51] amen well i believe every word said
[2:16:53] brother brandon that's good but that's
[2:16:54] just being able to read that
[2:16:57] take the message drink it in your heart
[2:16:59] that you must have the token
[2:17:01] the very light that was in christ be in
[2:17:03] you when i see that
[2:17:05] i will pass over you amen
[2:17:08] it's the evidence of the holy ghost is
[2:17:11] he
[2:17:11] who can believe the word you can
[2:17:14] receive it amen
[2:17:18] now if you believe the word like they
[2:17:20] did
[2:17:21] come on and receive it like they did
[2:17:24] you'll do with the supernatural
[2:17:26] happening in your life
[2:17:28] amen it may not be a tongue it may not
[2:17:30] be interpretation it may not be
[2:17:32] prophecy but it'll be the supernatural
[2:17:35] god moving in your life
[2:17:37] changing you transforming you are you
[2:17:40] with me amen it's the evidence of a holy
[2:17:43] ghost
[2:17:44] is he that can believe the word you can
[2:17:46] receive it then
[2:17:47] i want to ask you then can you receive
[2:17:50] this word
[2:17:51] question answer 64. now the baptism with
[2:17:54] the holy spirit
[2:17:55] is a definite experience that a person
[2:17:58] must receive
[2:18:00] amen so again did you get a different
[2:18:04] experience
[2:18:05] if you didn't need to go back and get
[2:18:07] your first works done over again
[2:18:09] hey man if the supernatural doesn't take
[2:18:12] place
[2:18:12] there's something still lacking
[2:18:16] amen now you don't shout to get it
[2:18:19] but you will shout because you have it
[2:18:21] [Music]
[2:18:23] come on somebody it isn't sensation
[2:18:27] but it is sensational as brother branham
[2:18:30] said
[2:18:31] in the god hiding himself in simplicity
[2:18:33] god unfolded himself
[2:18:35] not in sensation but you know sensations
[2:18:38] yet
[2:18:39] with it
[2:18:42] but you say but that was before the day
[2:18:44] before the seals was open okay
[2:18:46] and in the sixth seal he says hear it
[2:18:48] all it is
[2:18:49] it is it is an emotion though emotion
[2:18:52] accomplishing it
[2:18:55] amen now again
[2:18:59] it is the evidence of the holy ghost is
[2:19:01] he who can believe the word you can
[2:19:03] receive it
[2:19:03] then can you receive this word and the
[2:19:06] mighty god unveiled he said
[2:19:08] now it's right to bring him back exactly
[2:19:10] like he was in the beginning
[2:19:12] the same ministry the same jesus the
[2:19:15] same power
[2:19:16] the same holy ghost the same one that
[2:19:18] came down on the day of pentecost
[2:19:20] is the same holy ghost as manifested
[2:19:22] today from glory
[2:19:24] unto glory to glory and is back
[2:19:27] again it's in its in its original seed
[2:19:30] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:19:32] with the same signs same wonders same
[2:19:35] baptism
[2:19:36] same kind of people acting the same way
[2:19:39] with the same power
[2:19:40] the same sensation it's from glory unto
[2:19:43] glory
[2:19:44] and the next glory will be changed from
[2:19:47] this glory in the body like his own
[2:19:49] glorious body
[2:19:50] where we shall see him
[2:19:57] well but it's the evidence of the holy
[2:19:59] ghost is he who can believe the word you
[2:20:02] can receive it well then can you receive
[2:20:04] this word
[2:20:06] in time evangelism the scientific
[2:20:09] theory of the modern so-called religious
[2:20:12] groups
[2:20:13] has tried to prove that this blessed
[2:20:15] thing
[2:20:16] that we have called the holy spirit his
[2:20:18] only emotion
[2:20:21] see it just don't stand up according to
[2:20:23] their scientific theory i'd like to ask
[2:20:25] them this
[2:20:26] what makes them change
[2:20:29] i can hear it sometimes brother tim you
[2:20:32] know
[2:20:33] your youth camps and your youth services
[2:20:35] and my the young people they get free
[2:20:37] why
[2:20:38] every generation has to have their own
[2:20:40] revival
[2:20:42] you had yours why would you not them but
[2:20:44] theirs
[2:20:46] let them out their revival and get
[2:20:48] revived with
[2:20:49] it get the search out of your collar
[2:20:52] again
[2:20:52] and remember how it was to be filled
[2:20:55] with the holy ghost to be optionalized
[2:20:57] by the angel
[2:20:59] remember how it was for the power of god
[2:21:01] to move over your life
[2:21:03] and change you and move there come on
[2:21:06] give somebody else an opportunity to
[2:21:08] have that
[2:21:12] amen he said well i
[2:21:18] said the thing said these religious
[2:21:20] groups have tried to believe this
[2:21:22] blessed thing we have
[2:21:23] called the holy spirit his only emotion
[2:21:27] now they wouldn't accuse many churches
[2:21:29] of that today
[2:21:32] the holy ghost has just been able to re
[2:21:34] receive the read you know you come down
[2:21:36] you confess
[2:21:37] god sent a prophet or jesus as savior
[2:21:40] and you got the holy ghost and it's just
[2:21:42] a dried confession you just go back on
[2:21:44] there and live in your sins
[2:21:45] and do the best you can
[2:21:49] that's not the gospel
[2:21:52] amen the scientific theory of this
[2:21:55] modern-day
[2:21:55] so-called religious group should try to
[2:21:57] believe prove that this
[2:21:59] blessed thing we have called the holy
[2:22:01] spirit's only emotion
[2:22:02] see it won't stand up to their
[2:22:04] scientific theory
[2:22:06] well i'd like to ask them this what
[2:22:08] makes them
[2:22:09] change
[2:22:13] come on amen you know i look around here
[2:22:17] what made them change
[2:22:21] amen what took men who were drunkards or
[2:22:25] alcoholics or or dope or womanizers come
[2:22:29] on
[2:22:29] and all kinds of them what made them
[2:22:32] change
[2:22:35] amen what makes the drunkard stops
[2:22:38] drinking
[2:22:39] what makes the prostitute see cease our
[2:22:41] evil life
[2:22:42] what makes the cancer and diseases
[2:22:45] depart from the people
[2:22:46] and the deaf and the dumb and the blind
[2:22:48] and the dead to raise up
[2:22:51] so well i ain't never seen a deaf person
[2:22:54] here
[2:22:55] here we've had them happen right here in
[2:22:57] the church
[2:22:58] come on amen we've had it happen right
[2:23:01] overseas where women come around with a
[2:23:03] hearing aid in their hands and i don't
[2:23:04] need this anymore
[2:23:06] i can hear the shower running in my
[2:23:09] bathroom
[2:23:10] i can hear the children out there
[2:23:11] playing i don't need
[2:23:13] hearing aids anymore because i've been
[2:23:15] changed
[2:23:16] in the presence of the angel
[2:23:19] amen don't tell me amen i know
[2:23:22] black eyes have come open i know the
[2:23:25] death is heard
[2:23:26] i know cancers have been healed i mean
[2:23:30] you can call it just emotion it's more
[2:23:32] than emotion
[2:23:33] amen it's a power of god into salvation
[2:23:37] amen it has emotion with it certainly
[2:23:39] brother branham said
[2:23:41] certainly certainly i wonder
[2:23:44] do you believe that part of the word
[2:23:46] those who say well
[2:23:47] i just believe the message i just listen
[2:23:50] what do you believe them
[2:23:51] that it has emotion with it certainly
[2:23:54] certainly stop me
[2:23:57] amen are you ashamed of the emotion that
[2:24:00] goes on in your church by the deal
[2:24:01] no it happens certainly every time the
[2:24:05] angel comes
[2:24:06] every time the power of god comes down
[2:24:08] every time the holy ghost moves
[2:24:10] every time that the healing begins every
[2:24:13] time
[2:24:14] salvation happens every time the
[2:24:16] prodigal comes home
[2:24:17] amen we get emotional certainly
[2:24:23] certainly
[2:24:27] i hear a prophet say anything that is
[2:24:29] alive has emotion
[2:24:31] and anything that doesn't have emotion
[2:24:34] is dead
[2:24:35] excuse the expression but i think we
[2:24:37] ought to bury some of this
[2:24:39] of mostly religion because it's dead
[2:24:42] it has no emotion to it any religion
[2:24:45] that has not emotion
[2:24:46] should be buried because it is
[2:24:49] emotional
[2:24:54] certainly certainly
[2:24:58] oh man and if you've got the holy ghost
[2:25:01] you know that
[2:25:02] certainly amen it's the evidence of the
[2:25:05] holy ghost who can believe the word can
[2:25:07] you believe that word
[2:25:08] certainly
[2:25:11] get the promises unto you and to your
[2:25:14] children
[2:25:15] to them that are far off and as many as
[2:25:17] the lord our god shall call
[2:25:19] certainly hallelujah and they got drunk
[2:25:23] in the
[2:25:24] upper room certainly and they shouted
[2:25:27] and not spoken other languages certainly
[2:25:30] they may have been prophesied they may
[2:25:32] have spoken of their language
[2:25:36] certainly
[2:25:48] [Applause]
[2:25:51] that's why brother branham could say
[2:25:53] i've seen jumping spells
[2:25:55] and joy spells but there wasn't nobody
[2:25:58] hurt
[2:26:00] this is the last sermon the one last
[2:26:02] sermon is in 64.
[2:26:03] the mountains rung out the sun went down
[2:26:06] everything took place
[2:26:07] but there was nothing nobody heard i've
[2:26:10] seen meetings where the power of god was
[2:26:12] revealed to people
[2:26:13] and they were freed from the world and
[2:26:15] the things the world and the joy of the
[2:26:17] lord
[2:26:17] filled the congregation they stood and
[2:26:19] screamed and cried

[2:26:23] for the glory of god
[2:26:24] i never did see any disorderly there was
[2:26:27] always writing order because they
[2:26:29] had recognized that their name had been
[2:26:32] written
[2:26:32] on the lounge book of life before the
[2:26:35] foundation of the world
[2:26:37] they recognize jesus is mine

[2:26:59] devils are subject to you but your name
[2:27:03] is written in heaven

[2:29:42] come on not as a hand-me-down not as a
[2:29:45] second-hand doctrine
[2:29:47] but as an experience the purifier
[2:29:50] had what moses liked amen until that
[2:29:54] moses was a coward
[2:29:56] until that moses ran from the call up
[2:29:59] until that moses made
[2:30:01] excuses and remember one moment
[2:30:04] in the presence of the pillar of fire
[2:30:07] hallelujah he came out anointed
[2:30:09] with the mighty angel set and sanctified
[2:30:12] by the angel

[2:30:16] take why
[2:30:20] he had become anointed by the angel in
[2:30:23] the fire
[2:30:25] and until you're anointed by the angel
[2:30:27] in the fire
[2:30:28] you're just a dead stick in the water
[2:30:31] remember the moment the angel comes
[2:30:33] it'll transform your life it'll empower
[2:30:36] you as a believer
[2:30:37] it will give you overcoming power to
[2:30:40] rise up again
[2:30:41] against the things of the world somebody

[2:30:45] amen it'll give you a power and option
[2:30:48] [Music]
[2:30:50] oh my moses could walk down there
[2:30:54] at that time a call of god oh he knew he
[2:30:58] was called to be a prophet since he was
[2:31:00] a child
[2:31:01] he had been told oh you you know you're
[2:31:03] not of the world little children you
[2:31:05] you belong to christ and you know give
[2:31:08] your heart to jesus in the sunday school

[2:31:13] from the castle of my heart
[2:31:15] that the king is in residence there make
[2:31:17] yourself a place there

[2:31:21] and dwell you've been told that
[2:31:23] since a child moses amen you've been
[2:31:26] called
[2:31:27] to be the bride of christ you're told
[2:31:29] that you've told your
[2:31:30] name is on the book of life before the
[2:31:33] foundational world you've been told that
[2:31:35] moses
[2:31:35] hey man you understand all of that but
[2:31:37] in order
[2:31:38] to really come into his place he had to
[2:31:42] meet god face to face he had to talk
[2:31:45] with the angel
[2:31:47] in the burning bush and get anointed by
[2:31:50] that angel
[2:31:51] and get set and signified by the angel
[2:31:56] no man has a right to call himself thus
[2:31:59] or until he's talked with god face to
[2:32:02] face
[2:32:03] on the backside of the desert somewhere
[2:32:05] where he
[2:32:06] talked to god himself all the atheists
[2:32:10] in the world can't explain it away from
[2:32:12] him
[2:32:13] he was there he knew what happened

[2:32:47] was not at the mercy
[2:32:50] of him that just had an argument
[2:32:53] the man's atheist because he never met
[2:32:56] god
[2:32:57] but you met him and nobody can talk you
[2:33:00] out of that
[2:33:01] angelic visitation no devil
[2:33:04] no no no argument no persuasion
[2:33:07] could ever move you away
[2:33:11] why you met the angel
[2:33:14] yourself that's what made the difference
[2:33:19] amen you can have your seats now now no
[2:33:22] man has a right to call himself a
[2:33:24] christian
[2:33:25] till he's met the angel i'm not talking

[2:33:29] a little bit of pillar fire i'm not

[2:33:32] man walk out of a fire i'm talking about
[2:33:35] you come in the presence
[2:33:36] of almighty god amen
[2:33:40] and all the atheists in the world can
[2:33:43] never
[2:33:44] explain it away from you why
[2:33:47] every christian has to have that
[2:33:49] experience
[2:33:50] amen because they be before they can say
[2:33:54] anything about being a christian do you
[2:33:57] know we've had those
[2:33:59] who are 40 years in the message trying
[2:34:02] to preach the message
[2:34:04] and have never met god
[2:34:07] can you imagine we have generations that
[2:34:10] are raising up
[2:34:11] that that have never come into his
[2:34:14] presence
[2:34:15] when that's what the angel was sent to
[2:34:17] do
[2:34:18] because they have been denied that by
[2:34:21] because they
[2:34:22] have taken comfort in i've just received
[2:34:24] the doctrine
[2:34:25] and they become just a methodist
[2:34:27] believer or
[2:34:28] baptist believer or just like any kind
[2:34:31] of nominal
[2:34:32] denominational belief but i'm going to
[2:34:35] tell you friends
[2:34:37] there's an awakening going on
[2:34:41] moses had been 80 years so i've been 40
[2:34:44] years in the message by the dead
[2:34:46] hey hey moses had been 80 years
[2:34:50] he had long forgotten god's promise amen
[2:34:53] it looked like god had forgotten him
[2:34:56] but god never forgets his promise
[2:34:59] let me tell you when god sends a message
[2:35:02] the word will never return unto him void
[2:35:05] it's going to accomplish what he sent it
[2:35:07] to do if he said i'll have a bride
[2:35:10] and she'll be without spot or wrinkle if
[2:35:12] he said i have a supernatural pride
[2:35:14] a supernatural race he's gonna have
[2:35:17] everything he said he would have
[2:35:21] he never forgets he never forgets
[2:35:29] oh i know discouraging words come and
[2:35:32] people will say
[2:35:33] uh now brother brad has been gone as
[2:35:34] long as he was alive
[2:35:36] he was here 56 years and this year he'd
[2:35:38] be gone 56 years
[2:35:40] he'd been gone just as long as he was
[2:35:42] alive you know all things remain as it
[2:35:44] was from the beginning but god never
[2:35:46] forgets a promise
[2:35:49] his word never returns to him void his
[2:35:52] holy spirit hovers over
[2:35:54] that word to make it come to pass
[2:35:57] and he's going to find oh hallelujah
[2:35:59] that predestinated
[2:36:00] elect seed somewhere and then
[2:36:04] send an angel to them touch it with that
[2:36:06] angel

[2:36:56] meeting say i gotta have what you got

[2:38:22] even though that you'd run from him for
[2:38:24] 80 years like moses did
[2:38:26] he didn't give up on you that word kept
[2:38:29] chasing
[2:38:30] kept chasing moses it was there when he
[2:38:33] was in the sheep
[2:38:34] it was there in the tents of the media
[2:38:36] it was there everywhere that he went
[2:38:38] the angel of god moving moving moving
[2:38:41] moving until the time and god's got an
[2:38:44] appointed time

[2:38:50] we all have our time
[2:38:52] amen and dear god reached out oh
[2:38:54] hallelujah
[2:38:55] come down to a backslidden man by the
[2:38:58] name of moses who had been whipped out
[2:39:01] who said i can't do it who said i'll
[2:39:03] never be able to conquer
[2:39:04] who said i forgot it and god's forgot it
[2:39:07] and god has given up on his plan
[2:39:09] but god did never give up on his plan
[2:39:11] because he will his word will not return
[2:39:13] to empire
[2:39:14] amen he said i watch over my word i
[2:39:18] water it day and night amen i'm gonna
[2:39:20] make sure it happens in its time in its
[2:39:22] season

[2:39:31] hail marys you say
[2:39:33] how many blessings you get from man
[2:39:35] you've got to be born again and the
[2:39:37] spirit of god is the only thing
[2:39:39] that will substitute that will satisfy
[2:39:41] the human heart
[2:39:43] he said i know they got a substitute
[2:39:44] today of being born again just shake
[2:39:46] hands with the preacher
[2:39:47] and put your name on the book but
[2:39:49] friends that's a dogma it's not the
[2:39:52] truth
[2:39:53] if it were the actual apostle in the
[2:39:55] second chapter would have read like this
[2:39:57] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[2:39:59] the pastor walked out
[2:40:00] and shook hands with the preacher can
[2:40:02] you imagine us coming down to that kind
[2:40:04] of backslidden condition
[2:40:06] around the message where we just shake
[2:40:08] hands with somebody and say well if you
[2:40:10] believe the message you got it
[2:40:12] amen but said when the day of pentecost
[2:40:14] was fully come
[2:40:17] do you know where we're at amen this is
[2:40:20] the day
[2:40:21] of all the fully comes fully coming
[2:40:25] so that don't make sense well let me
[2:40:27] tell you it was 50 days of pentecost
[2:40:29] where that god married israel upon mount
[2:40:32] sinai 50 days after the passover
[2:40:37] amen come on then the passover comes 50
[2:40:40] days
[2:40:41] after jesus died at calvary here comes
[2:40:43] the day of pentecost
[2:40:45] they'll have the feast of weeks seven of
[2:40:48] them
[2:40:50] amen seven weeks since uh
[2:40:53] since the passover but when
[2:40:56] the day of pentecost was fully come
[2:41:02] but now we're in another day before he
[2:41:05] comes
[2:41:06] because dave we're only typing this day
[2:41:09] come on amen the new testament speaks of
[2:41:12] a bride in this end time
[2:41:14] is that right i mean since the passover
[2:41:17] since calvary
[2:41:18] we have had a feast of weeks of seven
[2:41:20] church ages
[2:41:22] but we've run out of ages we're here at
[2:41:24] the end time
[2:41:25] and this is the time when the day of
[2:41:27] pentecost again has fully come
[2:41:31] hallelujah there came a sound from
[2:41:33] heaven hey man
[2:41:35] here it comes out oh my this time what's
[2:41:37] it doing
[2:41:38] revealing all the mysteries showing
[2:41:41] yourself where we're at in the book
[2:41:43] about revealing the plan of redemption
[2:41:46] seven mighty angels
[2:41:47] stepping out amen in a pyramid form
[2:41:50] and revealing himself to prophet
[2:41:52] catching himself up giving him
[2:41:54] revelation
[2:41:57] you know why that this is pentecost this
[2:42:00] is the jubilee that's why heaven began
[2:42:03] to rejoice
[2:42:04] when they see the lamb had moved in
[2:42:06] heaven to take the book
[2:42:09] that's why we're rejoicing in this
[2:42:10] church that's why we're gathered like we
[2:42:12] are
[2:42:12] because we know the book isn't closed
[2:42:14] anymore we cannot meet with baptist
[2:42:17] methodist and presbyterian
[2:42:19] who preached from nicole's book
[2:42:22] we preach from an open book where all
[2:42:25] the mysteries of god are revealed
[2:42:27] amen this is the day of pentecost amen
[2:42:30] this is a time
[2:42:31] where all of the other acts of the
[2:42:34] scripture
[2:42:35] have been pointing and for running and
[2:42:37] speaking of
[2:42:38] our day and our hour there's somebody
[2:42:41] with me now
[2:42:42] amen he said there when the day of
[2:42:44] pentecost was fully come
[2:42:46] the inauguration of the church there
[2:42:49] came a sound from heaven
[2:42:51] like a rusty mighty wind and it filled
[2:42:53] all the house where they were sitting
[2:42:56] that's how the holy spirit came the
[2:42:58] first time
[2:42:59] that's how it comes every time since
[2:43:02] that time
[2:43:03] he's god and he changes not and that
[2:43:06] stumbles of people they say that was for
[2:43:08] another day
[2:43:09] but he said he's the same yesterday
[2:43:11] today and forever
[2:43:12] and every time the church ever received
[2:43:14] the holy ghost it always come like he
[2:43:17] did the first time
[2:43:18] under the same prescription acts 2 238
[2:43:21] never has changed never will change like
[2:43:24] a doctor's prescription for a disease
[2:43:27] he'll write it out for a prescription
[2:43:29] for disease the doctor does
[2:43:30] and then they're taking some quack drugs
[2:43:34] and he puts too much antidope in it and
[2:43:36] it's so weak it won't kill
[2:43:38] won't do you any good if it's too much
[2:43:40] poison and
[2:43:41] it'll kill you it's got to be wrote just
[2:43:44] according to the doctor
[2:43:45] and the doctor's prescription on how
[2:43:48] received the holy ghost is given to us
[2:43:50] by simon peter dr simon peter on the day
[2:43:53] of pentecost
[2:43:54] i'll give you a prescription repent and
[2:43:57] be
[2:43:58] every one of you and be baptized in the
[2:44:00] name of jesus christ
[2:44:01] for the remission of sin amen forever
[2:44:04] and you shall receive the gifts of the
[2:44:06] holy ghost
[2:44:07] for the prescription is to them that is
[2:44:09] fall
[2:44:10] and even as many as our lord our god
[2:44:13] shall call
[2:44:14] that's the eternal prescription
[2:44:17] hallelujah i wonder if the holy ghost
[2:44:20] that we we receive will agree that this
[2:44:23] right
[2:44:24] brother brandon talked about it he said
[2:44:26] a church this is birth pains
[2:44:28] he said when a little baby is born if
[2:44:31] you don't
[2:44:32] start breathing you spank him a little
[2:44:34] he
[2:44:35] yells out he said maybe in unknown
[2:44:37] tongues
[2:44:38] i never understood what idioms said i
[2:44:41] remember when i was when they were born
[2:44:43] i wasn't allowed to be in the hospital
[2:44:45] room with my wife
[2:44:46] but i was standing right outside the
[2:44:48] door
[2:44:50] listening for that first squeal
[2:44:53] amen it was always unknown tongues
[2:44:56] i guess to himself anyway he said he's
[2:44:59] making a noise
[2:45:00] and i think if a baby is born just by
[2:45:03] still birth
[2:45:05] no sound no emotion that's a dead baby
[2:45:10] that's what's a matter with the church
[2:45:12] today the system
[2:45:13] we got too many stillborn children
[2:45:17] that's right they need a gospel spanking
[2:45:19] you see so to wake them up and to bring
[2:45:21] them to their self
[2:45:22] so that god can breathe the breath of
[2:45:25] life into them
[2:45:27] amen now he said that's crude theology
[2:45:30] but it's the truth
[2:45:33] this is where we're at church listen
[2:45:37] the early church was led by pillar of
[2:45:39] fire
[2:45:41] if the pillar of fire is what brought
[2:45:43] the gospel in
[2:45:45] then the pillar of fire has to be here
[2:45:47] to take us in the rapture
[2:45:49] come on now amen now the in the bible
[2:45:53] the angel of the lord
[2:45:55] would show himself as a cloud by day
[2:45:59] and a light by night wherever
[2:46:03] the pillar of fire moved israel made
[2:46:05] sure
[2:46:06] their tent stakes wasn't driven down so
[2:46:08] far they couldn't move
[2:46:10] with it this has been the problem down
[2:46:13] to the ages
[2:46:14] hey man the pillar of fire moving people
[2:46:16] build a camp
[2:46:18] that might the pillar of fire would move
[2:46:20] on come on
[2:46:21] everybody closer it's trying to get them
[2:46:23] to the homeland of the bible
[2:46:25] so what they would do they had driven
[2:46:26] their stakes down so far they couldn't
[2:46:28] pull them up and move on so they made an
[2:46:30] encampment
[2:46:31] called badness or methodist or
[2:46:32] presbyterian or pentecostal
[2:46:35] are you with me amen so the same thing
[2:46:39] you see when the thunder had a fire it
[2:46:41] was a pillar fire where they stopped
[2:46:43] where it stopped they stopped where it
[2:46:45] moved they moved the priests will watch
[2:46:47] for it
[2:46:48] i think there needs to be some preachers
[2:46:50] today watching for the move of the
[2:46:52] pillar of fire
[2:46:53] hey man wave it was three o'clock they
[2:46:56] moved
[2:46:57] even moved at 12 midnight they moved
[2:46:59] they
[2:47:00] packed up when they saw it moving they
[2:47:03] packed up and went with
[2:47:04] it and they followed that pillar of fire
[2:47:07] they kept the will of god by doing that
[2:47:09] now but what happened luther organized
[2:47:12] his church
[2:47:13] drove his tent states down so far and
[2:47:15] the pillar of fire wouldn't hang over
[2:47:17] that
[2:47:19] come on so way it went and so
[2:47:23] luther and his followers they couldn't
[2:47:25] follow it
[2:47:26] and so it just weakened right down into
[2:47:29] an encampment are you with me now
[2:47:32] pillow if fire moved away from the
[2:47:34] lutheran church amen luther couldn't go
[2:47:36] because he had all his rituals and
[2:47:38] everything else
[2:47:38] and a little fella by the name of john
[2:47:40] wesley saw it move
[2:47:42] amen it was a holiness move he was there
[2:47:45] he watched a revival
[2:47:47] that saved england saved the united
[2:47:50] states
[2:47:51] let me tell you the values that we have
[2:47:53] in america
[2:47:55] came from seeing the pillar of fire amen
[2:47:58] and the holy spirit moved
[2:48:00] are you with me amen but what happened
[2:48:03] they would have
[2:48:03] george whitefield and george whitefield
[2:48:05] different ones that would stand up and
[2:48:07] they would preach the gospel circuit
[2:48:09] writer preacher
[2:48:10] they had a great revival but they got
[2:48:12] organized
[2:48:14] amen until they got the you know until
[2:48:16] finally it just becomes as cold
[2:48:18] and starchy as it can be and the pillar
[2:48:22] of fire
[2:48:23] listening to god's prophet will not hold
[2:48:26] over starchy and coldness
[2:48:32] amen it will not stay overnight
[2:48:35] when the when the pillar of fire moves
[2:48:37] you got to move
[2:48:39] the old song says when the lord gets
[2:48:41] ready you got to move
[2:48:43] you got to move you got to move
[2:48:46] come on hey man the pillar of fire won't
[2:48:49] hold over that
[2:48:50] he said then the bunch of people called
[2:48:52] the pentecostals got it
[2:48:54] they've seen it and the way they went
[2:48:55] but the sad part of it they so organized
[2:48:58] until the pillar of fire is moving out
[2:49:01] again and they can't go
[2:49:05] hallelujah but he said tonight
[2:49:08] here at god's house what that same
[2:49:11] pillar of fire
[2:49:12] is here in the house right here because
[2:49:14] it was the angel of heaven
[2:49:16] the lord jesus christ when he died he
[2:49:18] rose again he lives forever more he
[2:49:20] promised things
[2:49:21] he would do we would do also and greater
[2:49:23] and he went to the father is that right
[2:49:26] amen so again the pillar of fire is
[2:49:29] now in the house
[2:49:33] the next place is going to be the
[2:49:36] rapture
[2:49:36] [Music]
[2:49:38] hallelujah and i want to send notice i
[2:49:41] can see

[2:50:17] and snap and slap and whatever and could
[2:50:20] not do

[2:50:36] somebody
[2:50:39] and they're a demon growling and
[2:50:41] speaking in a beast-like condition

[2:50:47] bring that thing down to its knees and
[2:50:50] valley
