[43:41] zerubbabel thou shall become a plane and
[43:45] he shall bring forth The Headstone
[43:47] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[43:49] Grace unto it moreover the word of the
[43:53] Lord came unto me saying the hands of
[43:56] zerubbabel have laid the foundation of
[43:58] this house and his hand shall also
[44:01] finish it and that and thou shall know
[44:03] that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto
[44:06] you
[44:07] for who if despised the day of small
[44:10] things
[44:12] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[44:15] plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with
[44:18] those seven
[44:19] and they are the eyes of the Lord which
[44:22] run to and fro through the whole Earth
[44:26] praise the Lord
[44:28] I want to preach this evening on the day
[44:30] of small things
[44:32] God bless you may the Lord add his
[44:34] Blessing to the reading of his word
[44:37] Matthew chapter 11 verse 25 could you
[44:41] pull that up on the screen are you able
[44:42] to thank you brother
[44:43] are we able to pull that up Matthew 11
[44:46] 25
[44:48] Jesus said at that time Jesus answered
[44:51] and said I thank thee O Father
[44:55] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[44:57] has hid these things from the wise and
[45:00] prudent and has revealed them unto babes
[45:04] even so father so it seemed good in thy
[45:08] sight
[45:09] it was this scripture that brother
[45:11] Branham uses to open God revealed in
[45:15] Simplicity which opened the series of
[45:18] the Seven Seals and brother Branham
[45:20] built the entire seers uh the seal
[45:24] series upon God hiding himself in
[45:28] Simplicity and revealing himself in the
[45:32] same way
[45:33] and he used this scripture that he said
[45:37] it would be strange that the Lord would
[45:39] hide himself from one group and reveal
[45:42] himself to another he said and the wise
[45:45] miss it by a million miles
[45:48] praise the Lord you won't hurt me at all
[45:51] if you just say praise the Lord
[45:53] amen let's enter in if you can help me
[45:56] tonight
[45:56] and he and he and he said this he said I
[46:00] thought that we might study this
[46:02] before the great teaching of the Seven
[46:05] Seals he said now many miss him by the
[46:09] way that he reveals himself we know that
[46:12] that the church is built upon Revelation
[46:14] he said but the people miss him by the
[46:18] way that he reveals himself he said
[46:20] because men have their own ideas what
[46:23] God ought to do and how he ought to do
[46:26] it and he said and because they have
[46:29] maybe a preconceived idea in their mind
[46:32] or or unscriptural expectations that
[46:36] when he comes and reveals himself in a
[46:38] simple way or in a different way or in
[46:41] an unusual way it goes right over their
[46:44] head and he said notice it is it's the
[46:47] way it's always been been looking for
[46:49] what God will do and what he did but
[46:51] missing what he's doing he said the
[46:54] reason that they're missing what he's
[46:56] doing is because he is so simple in the
[46:59] present tense
[47:01] praise the Lord and then he told about
[47:03] the the the Infidel that that was up in
[47:08] the uh Utica area that saw the little
[47:10] girl going from Sunday school and he
[47:13] said where are you going she said I'm
[47:15] I'm I believe I'm going home from Sunday
[47:17] school and he said you said honey you're
[47:20] so wrong to believe that there was a god
[47:23] like that and the girl under the
[47:25] inspiration of the Lord picked a flower
[47:28] and said Mr Dorsey how did this get here
[47:32] what makes this live
[47:35] and it was there the Holy Spirit came
[47:38] upon Mr Dorsey and and brother Branham
[47:41] said at 86 years old he was gloriously
[47:44] converted he said because man can go to
[47:47] the moon but he does not understand how
[47:50] God can make a blade of grass Hallelujah
[47:53] and he said it pleases God to hide his
[47:57] power and His glory in simple things
[48:00] Hallelujah he said God is so great but
[48:03] he makes himself so simple that we
[48:06] stumble over Simplicity Jesus was The
[48:10] Stumbling Stone and they stumbled over
[48:13] the Simplicity of the Messiah can you
[48:16] say Amen now this is where I'm taking us
[48:19] this to get us a platform he says here
[48:22] in God hiding himself in Simplicity he
[48:25] said now you study it remember he's
[48:28] going into the seals he said you study
[48:31] it when you go to your motel rooms and
[48:34] those things you ponder over we don't
[48:36] have time to break it down like it
[48:38] should be broke down he said but I want
[48:41] you to do it get to your hotel wherever
[48:44] you're staring gather together and study
[48:47] this
[48:49] he said we miss him by the way that he
[48:53] reveals himself and how he reveals
[48:56] himself to the least
[48:59] he said we can expect the unusual when
[49:03] we're dealing with God
[49:05] if you know God you know God works in
[49:08] mysterious ways
[49:10] and if you're dealing with God you know
[49:12] if God is going to do something it will
[49:15] be unusual because God works in the
[49:18] unusual
[49:20] Hallelujah and this will always be God's
[49:24] principle theme because he said I am the
[49:27] Lord thy God I change not
[49:29] what he was he is and always will be and
[49:33] God will reveal himself to the simple in
[49:36] an unusual way in a mysterious way but a
[49:39] glorious way
[49:41] hallelujah hallelujah
[49:44] just like brother Tim was preaching on
[49:46] Abraham and Sarah and he's typing it
[49:49] with the church and how Sarah just did
[49:51] not have strength to conceive seed God
[49:55] comes to Abraham in a sovereign way in a
[49:58] glorious way because Abraham did not
[50:00] deserve it and he said I am going to
[50:02] make something great out of you I'm
[50:04] going to make you a father of Nations
[50:06] I'm going to make you I'm going to make
[50:09] you like a like a Son of God exalted in
[50:12] the Earth
[50:14] you would have thought if God was going
[50:16] to make a holy nation that he would have
[50:19] chose at least a young man or a young
[50:21] woman you would have thought that he
[50:23] would have chose someone fertile but
[50:25] God's choice was unusual it was
[50:28] mysterious because he chose an old man
[50:30] and an old woman and one that was Barren
[50:33] at that
[50:35] because God works in mysterious ways
[50:39] but see this is what makes God
[50:43] this is what displays his grace and His
[50:47] glory
[50:48] when he takes someone that can't and he
[50:50] does something with them
[50:54] Hallelujah
[50:55] see Abraham and Sarah were married and
[50:58] infertile but God said now I am making
[51:01] you a father of Nations not to make you
[51:04] something but to make me something
[51:07] it's not Abraham it's God who made
[51:10] Abraham the father of many nations
[51:14] and he said I'm gonna name you Abraham
[51:17] I'm gonna put my own name in your name
[51:20] and then he walked around just as Barren
[51:23] as ever I'm a father of Nations
[51:27] doesn't God move in mysterious ways
[51:31] every day it gets darker and more
[51:35] impossible and more impossible but
[51:38] something on the inside of Abraham is
[51:41] growing more faith and higher faith and
[51:43] because it wasn't Abraham looking to his
[51:46] own ability he was looking to the
[51:48] ability of almighty God it is a greater
[51:52] America it is a greater miracle
[51:56] Hallelujah
[51:57] God's working something out of the life
[52:00] of the Father Abraham
[52:04] and Abraham was a man of mistakes he
[52:06] wasn't a perfect man God put that in the
[52:09] Bible to let you know his children make
[52:11] mistakes but God's grace is greater
[52:15] because it's what God is doing in your
[52:17] life that is great
[52:19] and so Abraham makes a blunder it gets
[52:22] messed up with amblic hamblick says oh
[52:24] that's a beautiful woman he said you
[52:26] tell me you tell him you're you're my
[52:28] sister
[52:29] she said I'm gonna kill you when we get
[52:31] home
[52:34] he said just do what I say
[52:36] you're gonna get me killed
[52:40] that man said I have been looking all
[52:42] these years for in all my kingdom there
[52:45] ain't a woman as pretty as that girl
[52:47] man you got a pretty sister
[52:51] and we're going to be brother-in-laws
[52:54] that night he washed his brother Brandon
[52:57] said he put on his sleeping cap and
[52:59] stuck his big feet up at the end of the
[53:01] bed wiggling his toes think of it
[53:03] tomorrow that that man's sister is going
[53:05] to be my wife
[53:08] the spirit of the Lord came to him in a
[53:10] dream and said you are as good as a dead
[53:13] man
[53:15] he knew the Lord was angry in the dream
[53:17] he said Lord that man told him that he
[53:19] was his sister he said he said I
[53:22] wouldn't have sinned against you I'm a
[53:23] I'm a man of integrity God said that's
[53:25] why I haven't destroyed you
[53:28] but the Bible says he said if you do not
[53:30] give that man back his wife and have him
[53:34] pray for your sinful Soul I'll wipe out
[53:36] your whole nation
[53:38] you know what God was doing there was a
[53:41] word
[53:42] that placed upon the life of Abraham and
[53:46] that word had to be fulfilled
[53:48] and nothing would block that Sarah must
[53:52] bring forth Isaac in order to bring
[53:55] forth the genealogy of Christ it was God
[53:58] defending his own words
[54:00] [Applause]
[54:03] Hallelujah
[54:05] God closed up all the wombs that's why
[54:08] brother Branham said oh The Sovereign
[54:10] Grace of God
[54:13] it wasn't Abraham it was God's word he
[54:16] was defending
[54:18] and he bound himself into Abraham
[54:22] I think you'll be seeing something soon
[54:25] Hallelujah
[54:29] Isaac is born
[54:31] and God placed a word over Isaac's life
[54:35] now I'm talking about God is unusual
[54:39] and and he's I mean this is as brother
[54:41] Tim was saying on Sunday this is the
[54:43] apple of his eye
[54:45] I mean he and Sarah watching this 12
[54:48] year old boy look at him look at look at
[54:50] that boy he he excels better than
[54:52] anybody
[54:53] you know how daddy does and the spirit
[54:56] of the Lord came to Abraham said now
[54:58] take him up to Mariah and sacrifice that
[55:01] boy
[55:05] what a challenge
[55:08] no he does not give him any answer Lord
[55:12] no
[55:13] no what will Sarah will kill me wow Lord
[55:17] but he had learned the trust The Voice
[55:21] I want you to think about how much do
[55:22] why would God do it
[55:25] and so he goes three days journey and he
[55:27] tells the servants he said stay here
[55:30] while me and the boy go worship and the
[55:33] Holy Spirit brother said the grace of
[55:36] God it speaks out of Abraham and I and
[55:39] my son will come back
[55:41] why because they knew God placed the
[55:43] word upon Isaac and not even if he did
[55:47] die God would raise him up again
[55:50] because God had put a word upon the life
[55:54] of Isaac
[55:56] Hallelujah
[55:58] Hallelujah
[56:00] God's ways are mysterious now we can see
[56:03] in Clarity what God was doing looking
[56:06] back at it it was a perfect type of
[56:09] Jesus Christ but at the time you don't
[56:11] know what is happening but it's
[56:13] perfectly orchestrated God is in every
[56:16] detail
[56:20] God is in every detail of your life
[56:24] he absolutely is don't you think
[56:26] anything is an accident
[56:28] it is when God becomes too common is
[56:32] when we lose our faith
[56:34] is when we go off the road is when the
[56:37] things of God become common
[56:40] become a trend
[56:42] Hallelujah
[56:44] brother random said God is in the
[56:45] unusual he appears at unusual times he
[56:49] said but when we get into a trend then
[56:51] we miss God
[56:56] Hallelujah
[56:58] so in order to serve God we must serve
[57:01] him by faith
[57:03] and brother Branham describe Faith like
[57:05] swimming
[57:06] if I went into the water and if my feet
[57:08] can touch then I'd say look at me I'm
[57:11] swimming no you're not
[57:12] you're still EarthBound
[57:15] but if you can plunge out into the deep
[57:18] and you can't touch bottom then you are
[57:21] swimming
[57:22] and as long as you can see taste feel
[57:25] smelling here and you rest your
[57:27] experience upon an Earthly thing then
[57:30] your feet are still on the ground
[57:32] but when you can Plunge in by faith and
[57:36] begin to live by faith then God has you
[57:39] swimming
[57:40] Hallelujah
[57:43] Hallelujah that's what he said in
[57:44] Ezekiel water to the ankles water to the
[57:47] D water and then Plunge in waters to
[57:50] swim in that's the age we live in is
[57:54] that age of Faith where we are swimming
[57:56] in the glory of God
[57:57] [Applause]
[58:01] by faith
[58:03] the Bible said by faith Moses when he
[58:07] was born they hit him for three months
[58:10] Hallelujah
[58:12] his parents they knew he was a proper
[58:15] child
[58:16] brother Branham said he was when he was
[58:19] born the parents knew divinely that he
[58:22] was an instrument of God
[58:25] now this is amazing once again God is
[58:28] moving in simplicity
[58:30] so he is the son of Levi amram and
[58:33] Djokovic a son and a daughter of Levi
[58:36] they are slaves and God is going to pick
[58:38] the slave out of the mud pit and out of
[58:41] him is going to come forth a deliverer
[58:43] and a perfect type of Jesus Christ
[58:49] Hallelujah
[58:51] so the boy is born
[58:53] and they know he is the one
[58:56] in other words God has tied his Word of
[59:00] Promise into Moses
[59:04] and the Holy Spirit reveals to jacobit
[59:07] this is the man
[59:09] now they don't know anything and the
[59:12] Bible said that because she believed in
[59:15] faith they were not afraid of the king's
[59:18] commandment
[59:19] and when you believe you are not afraid
[59:22] your fear will fall away you know God
[59:25] will take care of his word
[59:28] She's Not Afraid Of The King's
[59:30] commandment she is not intimidated by
[59:32] the witches that are looking to kill her
[59:34] baby she's not intimidated by none of
[59:37] that God will keep his word
[59:41] God placed his word over him
[59:44] they hit him for three months
[59:48] the Bible said they could hear hide him
[59:50] no further
[59:51] and brother Branham dramatizes in an
[59:54] incredible way he said that that
[59:56] uh
[59:58] uh his daddy
[1:00:01] was praying away
[1:00:03] wakes up at three in the morning tells
[1:00:06] jokobed he said let's get down to the
[1:00:08] river
[1:00:09] and he said that that God had given
[1:00:12] amram the Divine instructions of the Ark
[1:00:16] and she built the ark accordingly and at
[1:00:19] night at three in the morning and he
[1:00:21] says this he gathered Aaron and marry
[1:00:24] him and they all secretly go down to the
[1:00:27] river
[1:00:28] and he describes how Miriam is like
[1:00:31] Daddy you're not going to get rid of her
[1:00:33] baby brother Daddy he said now you've
[1:00:36] got to be soldiers now
[1:00:39] and he tells he said nurse the baby she
[1:00:42] nurses the baby and then he said now put
[1:00:44] him in the ark and it looks like a
[1:00:47] little coffin and chocolate is weeping
[1:00:50] the children are crying and it's ripping
[1:00:52] her heart out they don't understand this
[1:00:55] God moves in mysterious ways but they
[1:00:58] trust that God's word is in this child
[1:01:02] Aaron and Miriam they kiss him and amram
[1:01:05] tells them to be of Courage this is so
[1:01:08] unusual
[1:01:10] now something amazing takes place
[1:01:13] all of a sudden God anoints jock a bed
[1:01:17] with faith
[1:01:18] is she hot she puts that baby her little
[1:01:21] baby her prince into that little coffin
[1:01:25] the Bible said that she took that and
[1:01:28] she put that that Ark into the river
[1:01:31] and by faith
[1:01:33] she pushes this little Ark
[1:01:37] and everything that's within it
[1:01:39] she pushes it out into a to a crocodile
[1:01:43] infested waters
[1:01:45] the place is swarming and Tails are
[1:01:48] flapping babies have been eating in here
[1:01:50] and brother Brandon said this is a type
[1:01:52] of jocka bed putting her baby by faith
[1:01:56] into death
[1:01:58] into the Waters of death
[1:02:01] but now faith has taken over
[1:02:04] how can a mother against her own nature
[1:02:07] send her child on a death trip but it
[1:02:10] isn't that she sees gloomy clouds but
[1:02:14] she knows that the sun is still Shining
[1:02:18] even in your trials even in your hard
[1:02:21] times the sun is still shining and it
[1:02:25] wasn't a woman doing this it was eyes of
[1:02:28] faith that was looking to The God Who
[1:02:31] made a promise I will deliver my people
[1:02:34] [Applause]
[1:02:39] Hallelujah
[1:02:41] Sun's always Shining
[1:02:43] John saw him in the church ages he shine
[1:02:46] like the sun shining in its strength but
[1:02:49] even when the clouds cover it he's still
[1:02:51] shining tonight
[1:02:53] if you're sick he's still shining
[1:02:55] tonight
[1:02:56] Hallelujah
[1:02:58] behind those gloomy clouds was a living
[1:03:00] God
[1:03:02] she pushed it out by faith
[1:03:05] out into the water
[1:03:08] and when she left when it left her hands
[1:03:10] it went into the hands of God
[1:03:14] and as it went out into the waters every
[1:03:17] Angel is watching over this little Ark
[1:03:20] it's under the protection of the word of
[1:03:22] God
[1:03:25] do you love the Lord
[1:03:27] jacobit is moving by revelation
[1:03:31] now brother Branham said because
[1:03:33] jochebed put this baby in the Water by
[1:03:36] faith it proved the power of faith is
[1:03:39] greater than death
[1:03:41] because the waters were death and by
[1:03:43] faith she placed her baby there and God
[1:03:46] gave that baby back
[1:03:48] he said furthermore she nursed that baby
[1:03:50] furthermore he said he made the devil
[1:03:53] pay for his education made the devil
[1:03:55] feed him and make the devil clothe him
[1:03:57] he was making the devil raise his own
[1:03:59] deliverer
[1:04:02] if you will trust God God will hang the
[1:04:05] devil on his own Gallows
[1:04:09] but you've got to have faith you've got
[1:04:12] to get your feet off the ground and get
[1:04:14] it into faith in the Living God
[1:04:17] Hallelujah
[1:04:19] God put a a word over that child
[1:04:23] brother Benham said God knows how to do
[1:04:25] things
[1:04:26] God knows how to Humble you he sometimes
[1:04:29] does things in different ways he knows
[1:04:32] how to take the starch out of you he
[1:04:34] knows how to make you the man you ought
[1:04:36] to be he knows what's inside you God
[1:04:39] does things in great ways God does
[1:04:42] things in different ways
[1:04:49] and we know the story Moses was a man of
[1:04:52] problems and issues and he makes an
[1:04:55] attempt he falls on his face
[1:04:57] it don't look right
[1:04:59] backslides for 40 years
[1:05:03] and then think about it God decided to
[1:05:06] use him as an old man
[1:05:11] you would think that God would use a
[1:05:13] young man
[1:05:14] but God uses an old man
[1:05:18] sometimes God uses young fellas
[1:05:22] sometimes he uses old people
[1:05:25] I know the world forgets about you but
[1:05:27] God doesn't
[1:05:29] and so God meets him in a burning bush
[1:05:31] and this is so unusual God never did it
[1:05:34] before
[1:05:35] God never met Abraham in a burning bush
[1:05:38] this was Abraham this is Moses day
[1:05:41] and he said I'm sending you down now
[1:05:44] against every Chariot against all the
[1:05:48] spears of Egypt against the armies a
[1:05:50] one-man invasion I am sending you down
[1:05:53] as an old man to deliver my people
[1:05:56] Hallelujah
[1:05:58] and he did it
[1:06:01] God moves in mysterious ways
[1:06:04] the Bible said my thoughts are not your
[1:06:07] thoughts
[1:06:08] neither are your ways my ways and as the
[1:06:12] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[1:06:14] my ways higher than your ways and my
[1:06:17] thoughts higher than your thoughts
[1:06:20] we many times we fall into a pit by
[1:06:23] reasoning you can't reason God you've
[1:06:26] got to believe God
[1:06:28] it is a beautiful Faith walk and every
[1:06:31] individual needs his own faith
[1:06:35] brother random told a story about his
[1:06:37] mother-in-law her clock had quit working
[1:06:39] and she was a poor woman and she said
[1:06:41] Lord I need this clock to work with you
[1:06:44] fix it and it started working fine
[1:06:47] does God does God is he a clock Master
[1:06:49] is he does he fix clocks
[1:06:52] he did that one
[1:06:54] you know why because she was simple
[1:06:56] enough to believe
[1:06:59] it wasn't complicated she was simple
[1:07:02] enough to know if God can move a red sea
[1:07:04] or Raise A Man from the dead then he can
[1:07:07] fix my clock I imagine
[1:07:10] and brother Branham said a few days
[1:07:12] later her refrigerator went out and she
[1:07:14] said I can't afford another refrigerator
[1:07:16] Lord you fix my clock how do you do
[1:07:18] refrigerators
[1:07:20] and brother random said it started
[1:07:21] running again
[1:07:23] how many sisters believe in that
[1:07:25] I believe with all my heart that we
[1:07:27] could have faith like that brother
[1:07:29] Branham said believe him
[1:07:31] believe him for a husband believe him
[1:07:34] for a wife believe him for a job believe
[1:07:37] him for everything
[1:07:39] [Applause]
[1:07:41] I think that's the kind of Faith we're
[1:07:43] supposed to have in the kitchen
[1:07:46] young people brother men have said pray
[1:07:48] over your tests you're supposed to pray
[1:07:50] God I want a good grade healthy Lord
[1:07:54] and no matter who you are brother Benham
[1:07:56] said God is interested in you he's
[1:07:59] interested in everything our churches no
[1:08:02] matter how little or how large every lay
[1:08:04] member if you're a housewife God is
[1:08:07] interested in you
[1:08:10] Hallelujah
[1:08:11] you believe that
[1:08:13] God is so strange
[1:08:16] that we talk about Israel how they
[1:08:19] murmured and they died and they wandered
[1:08:21] in the wilderness for 40 years and you
[1:08:23] think my goodness what what Joshua had
[1:08:26] to go through but then as soon as they
[1:08:28] get into the land Rahab is there
[1:08:31] and Rahab is a predestinated seed she
[1:08:35] comes into the family of Israel and out
[1:08:37] of all the women God puts her as a
[1:08:40] mother in the genealogies of Christ
[1:08:43] this is so strange
[1:08:47] and we could just go on and on that the
[1:08:50] nation of Israel was made of barren
[1:08:52] women
[1:08:55] God is showing I have done this
[1:09:01] I wouldn't have put Bathsheba in there
[1:09:07] I mean how did Bathsheba get in there
[1:09:11] that blow it's beyond what I can grasp
[1:09:15] I have no answer
[1:09:18] and then when God calls Mary to bring
[1:09:21] forth the Redeemer
[1:09:24] God comes out of a controversial name
[1:09:27] who is going to believe this
[1:09:30] she's got to Bear the reproach of her
[1:09:32] revelation
[1:09:34] and she's walking around with a and and
[1:09:37] she testifies I am innocent
[1:09:39] and nobody is going to believe her and
[1:09:42] not even Joseph would have believed her
[1:09:44] he wanted to I can imagine after six
[1:09:48] months at Elizabeth's house and he sees
[1:09:50] her and he says no
[1:09:56] Joseph Joseph leave me alone
[1:09:59] thank you
[1:10:01] God no no
[1:10:05] she says Joseph I'm innocent I'm
[1:10:07] innocent
[1:10:10] and look God moves in mysterious unusual
[1:10:14] wait
[1:10:16] and Joseph's like Mary hit
[1:10:18] you
[1:10:21] and he goes home God I don't know what
[1:10:22] to do I don't want to see her stoned I I
[1:10:26] don't have that in me
[1:10:27] no doubt he falls asleep stressed
[1:10:32] and an angel comes that says fear not
[1:10:34] Joseph
[1:10:38] for that which is in hers born of the
[1:10:40] Holy Ghost
[1:10:42] I am all over this Joseph
[1:10:45] stay strong he comes out of it and
[1:10:48] instead of putting her away he becomes
[1:10:50] her Shield
[1:10:51] he becomes her protector because God put
[1:10:55] a word on the inside of that girl
[1:10:59] and God raised him up to protect that
[1:11:02] word
[1:11:04] Hallelujah
[1:11:06] unusual yes
[1:11:08] God works in mysterious ways his wonders
[1:11:12] to perform his footsteps are in the sea
[1:11:15] and he rides upon the storm deep in
[1:11:18] unfathomable binds of never-ending skill
[1:11:21] he works out his treasures and works his
[1:11:25] Sovereign will
[1:11:27] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:11:31] God invested something into her
[1:11:34] God's now he don't care about her
[1:11:37] reputation
[1:11:39] he cares about his reputation
[1:11:42] Hallelujah but now she has a revelation
[1:11:46] and she can stand there in the face of
[1:11:48] scoffers
[1:11:50] she can stand there in the face of it
[1:11:52] and say I knew whom I believed
[1:11:54] because she's walking by faith I met an
[1:11:57] angel
[1:11:58] and if I've got a standalone I'll Stand
[1:12:01] amen this Revelation this message
[1:12:04] ought to be a revelation from heaven
[1:12:07] that even if you stand alone you'll
[1:12:09] stand for God because it come from
[1:12:11] heaven
[1:12:13] hallowed
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:15] God hath chosen the foolish things of
[1:12:19] the world to confound the wise
[1:12:21] God has chosen the weak things of the
[1:12:24] world to confound those things that are
[1:12:26] mighty
[1:12:27] the base things of the world the things
[1:12:30] that are despised
[1:12:33] hath God choose
[1:12:35] yeah the things which are not to bring
[1:12:39] to not the things that are
[1:12:42] that no flesh will glory in his presence
[1:12:49] God always takes nothing
[1:12:52] and makes something out of it
[1:12:58] Hallelujah
[1:12:59] so it's not man's working it's God's
[1:13:02] working
[1:13:03] everybody see that
[1:13:04] it's God's nature to do it
[1:13:07] God takes stinky fishermen
[1:13:10] that's my bride
[1:13:14] tax collectors
[1:13:26] oh yeah
[1:13:28] pluck some from Ohio
[1:13:31] pluck some from Louisiana
[1:13:34] we're all in the same pot brother Joe
[1:13:37] you know why so he can show his glory
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:43] you know 1946
[1:13:45] brother Branham launches a healing
[1:13:48] campaign that the world has never seen
[1:13:51] the world has never seen what we have
[1:13:54] witnessed in this day
[1:13:56] how many believe that
[1:13:58] and brother Branham said when the angel
[1:13:59] told him you will pray for kings and
[1:14:02] monarchs and so forth and the angel
[1:14:04] tells him and he said I will be with you
[1:14:06] he said I'll go the angel vanishes and
[1:14:09] he does not tell brother Branham how
[1:14:11] he's going to do it
[1:14:13] he just said you're going to do it
[1:14:15] brother Brandon said I believe it and he
[1:14:17] did not tell him how
[1:14:19] and so we know that it was launched from
[1:14:22] the supernatural Billy Graham was
[1:14:24] launched from a public publicity but
[1:14:28] brother branham's was launched by
[1:14:30] Supernatural
[1:14:31] can you say Amen
[1:14:33] and so brother Benham tells the story he
[1:14:36] said when I launched the healing
[1:14:38] campaign
[1:14:39] he said I did not even have my own suit
[1:14:43] and he said my brother had gotten in a
[1:14:46] wreck and tore the suit up and he said
[1:14:49] so I brought it to meet up media went
[1:14:51] down to a 10 cent store and ironed iron
[1:14:54] uh the iron patches on the suit and he
[1:14:58] said it looked okay he said but then the
[1:15:01] pocket was torn it might have been here
[1:15:04] and he said I tried to sew it up and he
[1:15:06] said I'm not very good and he said so it
[1:15:10] looks so bad and this is his direct
[1:15:13] words he said I was pretty well ashamed
[1:15:16] of it
[1:15:18] he said so when he went out in the
[1:15:20] public he would keep it covered with his
[1:15:23] hand and he would shake with his left
[1:15:25] hand
[1:15:26] he said because I was ashamed of that
[1:15:31] coat
[1:15:32] he said but when that blind girl from
[1:15:35] Memphis her eyes came open and the men
[1:15:38] began to charge him and a man said I
[1:15:40] know you you're William Branham he said
[1:15:43] ask God to heal me he said Do you
[1:15:45] believe it he said I do he said give me
[1:15:48] your stick he said before my eyes that
[1:15:50] crippled leg came straight and the
[1:15:53] people began to rush him he said they
[1:15:56] were reaching for that jacket he said it
[1:15:59] was not the jacket it was not the man in
[1:16:02] the jacket it was Christ that they had
[1:16:04] faith in
[1:16:06] and the very thing he was ashamed of was
[1:16:10] the very tool that God was using to
[1:16:13] bring forth his glory
[1:16:17] Hallelujah
[1:16:19] Hallelujah
[1:16:22] God is revealed in foolishness
[1:16:27] even brother Branham as humble as he was
[1:16:29] he's missing what God is doing
[1:16:34] brother Branham said we can't get that
[1:16:36] low
[1:16:38] brother Tim was talking about the third
[1:16:40] poll and brother random is fishing on
[1:16:42] the water and the Holy Spirit comes over
[1:16:45] that boat said call that little fish to
[1:16:47] life that fish was a minnow
[1:16:50] that fish was a bait fish none of us
[1:16:53] have feeling for baked fish
[1:16:55] I'm glad that was not my lot life
[1:16:59] but God knew it
[1:17:02] he stood up and said little fishy Jesus
[1:17:04] Christ gives you your life and that that
[1:17:07] fish that laid there for a half hour
[1:17:09] come back to life and swam down to the
[1:17:13] water
[1:17:14] he said God was showing he cares about
[1:17:18] the littlest things
[1:17:21] he knows what you were praying brother
[1:17:24] he knows every one of you many times we
[1:17:28] feel like we can slip through the cracks
[1:17:30] but the youngest of us God knows our
[1:17:33] needs
[1:17:34] and God answers our prayers
[1:17:36] because God cares about the widows God
[1:17:40] cares about the old people they're
[1:17:42] losing their health and losing their
[1:17:44] hair and and people they kind of move on
[1:17:47] life is Fast and the old get left behind
[1:17:50] but God is watching
[1:17:54] God restores that little fish
[1:17:57] to show his resurrection power on the
[1:18:01] least
[1:18:05] we can experience his resurrection power
[1:18:08] tonight anyone in this building can
[1:18:12] experience his resurrection power
[1:18:15] my brother Bradham said we must yield
[1:18:17] ourselves to the spirit of God
[1:18:21] he said we must yield ourselves every
[1:18:24] one of us he said that's God's heroes or
[1:18:27] those that are weak and God will make
[1:18:30] them strong out of the weakness of
[1:18:32] humility God chooses his people to build
[1:18:36] his kingdom
[1:18:40] he said if we ever get to heaven
[1:18:43] if we ever stand in the presence of God
[1:18:45] with his church
[1:18:46] we'll stand in a bunch of people that
[1:18:49] has been weak rejected cast out by the
[1:18:54] worlds and know it nothings
[1:18:57] and God molds himself into the helpless
[1:19:02] this is why Hannah when she prayed and
[1:19:05] God opened her womb she goes you raise
[1:19:07] us out of the dunghill
[1:19:10] how many have been raised out of the
[1:19:12] dunge Hill some of you sitting in a bar
[1:19:14] somewhere would have been out of your
[1:19:16] mind on crack cocaine but God has
[1:19:19] restored your mind God did not forget
[1:19:21] you
[1:19:25] Hallelujah
[1:19:27] out of weakness our weakness is God's
[1:19:30] opportunity
[1:19:33] I'm getting to the heart of my thought
[1:19:38] Israel God could do no more with them he
[1:19:41] had become common they had prospered so
[1:19:44] much that they had fallen into sin and
[1:19:47] God sent Prophet after Prophet trying to
[1:19:49] pull him back they would not listen God
[1:19:51] raised up Jeremiah and said God is
[1:19:53] finished 70 years you'll go into
[1:19:55] captivity
[1:19:58] Babylon will take over
[1:20:02] he said but after 70 years
[1:20:05] God in his grace he placed a word over
[1:20:08] Israel
[1:20:09] I will bring you back
[1:20:13] Hallelujah
[1:20:15] he was left up to Israel they never
[1:20:17] would have got back but God placed a
[1:20:19] word over them and after 70 years
[1:20:22] God anointed Cyrus and we could spend a
[1:20:25] long time on Cyrus amazing person in the
[1:20:28] Bible but God stirred the heart of Cyrus
[1:20:32] and Cyrus is pressed to perform the word
[1:20:36] of the Lord
[1:20:37] because there was a word that God placed
[1:20:39] upon Israel and he'll make even his
[1:20:42] enemies to be at peace and he calls
[1:20:44] Cyrus to have a burden to see Israel go
[1:20:47] back to her Homeland and worship
[1:20:50] and so in 536 BC a Remnant returns and
[1:20:56] zerubbabel is with him and zerubbabel
[1:20:58] begins to build the foundations
[1:21:02] then under great opposition from the
[1:21:05] enemy
[1:21:06] the work was postponed for seven years
[1:21:09] and then God stirred them up again to
[1:21:12] finish their work can we pull up
[1:21:14] Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse 8.
[1:21:18] uh eight through ten if you can
[1:21:22] praise the Lord everybody love the Lord
[1:21:24] he said and this is our opening
[1:21:26] scripture he said moreover the word of
[1:21:30] the Lord came unto me saying the hands
[1:21:33] of zerubbabel have laid the foundation
[1:21:36] of this house
[1:21:37] and His Hands shall also
[1:21:41] finish it
[1:21:42] and thou shall know
[1:21:45] that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto
[1:21:47] you
[1:21:48] for who hath despised
[1:21:51] the day of small things
[1:21:54] this signifies
[1:21:57] the poor beginnings
[1:21:59] of the rebuilding of the Temple
[1:22:02] the Small Beginnings they were
[1:22:06] they were weak
[1:22:08] they had no friends
[1:22:10] that's why they were taunted by their
[1:22:12] enemy what will these feeble Jews do
[1:22:15] will they resurrect the temple out of
[1:22:17] the ashes and they're taunting them but
[1:22:20] there was a word placed over them
[1:22:23] and the devil is in opposition trying to
[1:22:26] slow them down and he said who hath
[1:22:29] despised the day of Small Beginnings
[1:22:33] who has despised even though it's small
[1:22:36] and insignificant God was involved in
[1:22:40] its beginnings
[1:22:42] and that's what's going to make it a
[1:22:44] success
[1:22:45] and then he said and
[1:22:48] he shall see like who is despised verse
[1:22:51] 10 who is despised the day of small
[1:22:54] things
[1:22:55] for they shall rejoice
[1:22:58] and shall see the plummet in the hand of
[1:23:01] zerubbabel with those seven
[1:23:04] they are the eyes of the Lord which run
[1:23:07] to and fro the whole Earth
[1:23:09] now is the ruble they're saying now
[1:23:11] they're despised because of their slow
[1:23:14] Small Beginnings
[1:23:17] God working in simplicity
[1:23:20] God using nobodies just people look like
[1:23:24] they're just barely scratching it
[1:23:27] but then they shall rejoice to see the
[1:23:30] plummet in the hand of zerubbabel who
[1:23:33] was the architect under God and they're
[1:23:37] watching he's saying these Small
[1:23:39] Beginnings will develop into the
[1:23:42] Fulfillment of the restoration of my
[1:23:45] temple and the Fulfillment of my word
[1:23:49] Hallelujah not by power
[1:23:53] not by might but by my spirit saith the
[1:23:58] Lord
[1:23:59] brother random said this was prophetic
[1:24:03] of our hour
[1:24:06] brother random had
[1:24:08] used this scripture to preach the
[1:24:11] message of Grace
[1:24:13] and he said now we know that this was
[1:24:16] the preparation
[1:24:18] and the restoration of the Temple
[1:24:20] and zerubbabel was a great Prince among
[1:24:23] the people who had laid the foundation
[1:24:26] of the building
[1:24:27] he said now I want you to put on your
[1:24:30] spiritual thinking he said notice
[1:24:33] he was determined the great Prince to
[1:24:36] rebuild the house of the Lord and when
[1:24:39] he did he laid the foundation stone
[1:24:42] but then he went on to say zerubbabel
[1:24:46] laid the foundation he shall also bring
[1:24:49] forth The Headstone he said now think of
[1:24:54] this for a few minutes everyone stay
[1:24:55] with me he said the Sabbath Church age
[1:24:58] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:25:02] the children back to the fathers in
[1:25:05] other words he would rebuild the church
[1:25:08] in the power of God
[1:25:11] not by power not by might by my spirit
[1:25:16] saith the Lord he said the holy spirit
[1:25:19] will bring forth a church in the last
[1:25:22] days
[1:25:26] zerubbabel the prince with Joshua was to
[1:25:30] bring forth The Headstone he laid the
[1:25:33] foundation he took the people back to
[1:25:36] the foundation in type now the
[1:25:39] candlesticks we read about represented
[1:25:41] both Jewish and Gentile churches he said
[1:25:44] now he said just like the pyramid they
[1:25:48] worked that pyramid up he said Enoch
[1:25:50] must have built it but they did not have
[1:25:53] a headstone he said that's a type of the
[1:25:56] body of Christ he said that every one of
[1:25:59] those stones came together you could not
[1:26:01] run a razor blade in between those
[1:26:04] stones he said it is a type of the body
[1:26:07] of Christ that every stone in the body
[1:26:11] is caught by the holy spirit in
[1:26:14] Precision God has a place for you in the
[1:26:18] body of Christ it is the work of
[1:26:20] almighty God and we are drawing this one
[1:26:23] to this one this one to this one this
[1:26:25] one to this one and God is bringing his
[1:26:28] body together bringing his church
[1:26:31] together Machinery cannot do it it takes
[1:26:34] God to do that
[1:26:38] it is by the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:41] and the and the headstone is Christ now
[1:26:45] brother Branham said according to the
[1:26:47] prophecy there will be a headstone and
[1:26:50] that headstone when it comes the prince
[1:26:52] will cry Grace Grace to it it is not by
[1:26:57] works it is by the grace of God the
[1:27:00] message of Grace has been attacked by
[1:27:03] the devil he said but there is a Grace
[1:27:06] that has been sent to this hour
[1:27:09] and brother Branham said look at David
[1:27:13] built a temple
[1:27:15] and he said now I am living in a house
[1:27:17] and my Lord is out there under skins and
[1:27:21] he told Nathan I want to build him a
[1:27:23] house and Nathan prophesied to David and
[1:27:26] said David I took you from the sheep
[1:27:29] goat
[1:27:31] you were nothing
[1:27:35] nothing you would have been forgotten
[1:27:38] but I chose you
[1:27:41] and I set you as a king over Israel
[1:27:46] and it was David that had a desire to
[1:27:49] build a temple a Dwelling Place
[1:27:52] for almighty God
[1:27:55] brother brainer said these are types
[1:27:57] that are pointing to this day
[1:28:00] when the messenger of the hour would cry
[1:28:02] not by power not by might not by Man's
[1:28:07] power not by denomination but by the
[1:28:12] spirit of God
[1:28:13] it is the spirit of God that heals his
[1:28:15] people it is the spirit of God that
[1:28:18] leads his people it is the spirit of God
[1:28:20] that places you into the body of Christ
[1:28:22] it places me into the body of Christ and
[1:28:26] brother Branham said it takes the
[1:28:28] Simplicity of believing
[1:28:32] the Simplicity of believing God
[1:28:37] that brings us into this body
[1:28:40] Hallelujah
[1:28:41] if I love the Lord
[1:28:45] he bypassed Caiaphas
[1:28:47] he bypassed the Sanhedrin and he poured
[1:28:51] his Spirit upon a bunch of fishermen
[1:28:54] and tax collectors
[1:28:58] who hath despised
[1:29:01] the day
[1:29:03] the small things
[1:29:07] brother banham had in in the breach
[1:29:09] quoted this scripture he said who it
[1:29:12] despised the day of small things God
[1:29:15] revealed
[1:29:17] in simplicity
[1:29:21] God took us seventh grade
[1:29:24] a man with a seventh grade education
[1:29:28] and manifest the son of man
[1:29:31] on a level
[1:29:33] even the Bible don't record
[1:29:36] the Miracles that have been recorded in
[1:29:38] what has taken place in our day
[1:29:43] and it's so simple and so humble
[1:29:47] that you say how can't the people see it
[1:29:49] because it's too
[1:29:52] ridiculous
[1:29:55] it's the truth they're stumbling over
[1:29:58] something so small
[1:30:03] Hallelujah but I love the Lord
[1:30:07] God has sent us a simple message
[1:30:10] a simple gospel
[1:30:13] and brother Branham said now
[1:30:17] he said the angel that spoke to
[1:30:19] Zachariah
[1:30:21] said not by power
[1:30:23] not by might
[1:30:25] you will not accomplish anything in
[1:30:27] yourself
[1:30:29] but it's God's work in you
[1:30:33] it is the holy spirit that is revealed
[1:30:35] this message to you it was never you it
[1:30:39] was always God and the same God that put
[1:30:42] a word in Abraham that put a word in
[1:30:45] Sarah that put a word as put a word in
[1:30:48] his church
[1:30:50] the same God that put a word in Moses
[1:30:53] has put a word on you God has started
[1:30:56] his work in you
[1:30:58] and now God will bring it to completion
[1:31:03] brother random said God brought us from
[1:31:05] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:31:08] the Holy Ghost now coming to the cap
[1:31:11] where that bunch is honed out and it can
[1:31:14] fit a Ministry like he had when he went
[1:31:16] away it'll catch us into the rapture we
[1:31:19] are Justified Sanctified baptized with
[1:31:22] the Holy Ghost the house of God will
[1:31:25] live again
[1:31:27] Hallelujah by grace are you saved
[1:31:31] through faith
[1:31:32] not of yourselves it is the gift of God
[1:31:35] you are his workmanship
[1:31:40] how many believe that
[1:31:41] how many believe that God has started to
[1:31:44] work in your life
[1:31:46] how many know that with all their heart
[1:31:49] how many know I'm not where I want to be
[1:31:52] but I'm not where I used to be it's
[1:31:54] because God started the work
[1:31:57] but we should not be getting discouraged
[1:31:59] as the hour is darker and darker it is a
[1:32:03] faithless generation it is an adulterous
[1:32:05] generation but God has placed a word
[1:32:08] over this bride
[1:32:10] and it don't matter how dark it gets God
[1:32:13] has started a work in this church
[1:32:17] it's God in you
[1:32:20] it's God that has done it and God will
[1:32:23] complete it
[1:32:24] God has laid your foundation God has set
[1:32:28] your pillars God will bring forth the
[1:32:31] Capstone in your life
[1:32:33] Hallelujah it was never you in the
[1:32:36] beginning
[1:32:37] you're not holding on to God God is
[1:32:39] holding on to you
[1:32:40] I don't believe in loose living I
[1:32:42] believe in holy living but I believe it
[1:32:45] is the Holy Ghost In You
[1:32:47] I don't believe you're living your own
[1:32:49] Holiness I believe it is the Holy Ghost
[1:32:51] living through you
[1:32:54] Hallelujah
[1:32:56] if I love the Lord
[1:33:01] seven golden candlesticks
[1:33:04] that's what Zachariah Saw made of pure
[1:33:07] gold
[1:33:08] John said it was beaten work
[1:33:12] the True Church of Jesus Christ is
[1:33:15] likened unto pure gold her righteousness
[1:33:17] is his righteousness
[1:33:19] her attributes is his glorious
[1:33:21] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:33:25] what he is we are to reflect what he is
[1:33:29] she is to manifest
[1:33:31] there is no fault in her
[1:33:34] she is all glorious within and without
[1:33:37] from beginning to end she is the work of
[1:33:42] the Lord
[1:33:44] how many believe you're the work of the
[1:33:46] Lord

[1:34:11] and purpose of God that means god
[1:34:14] deposited his word
[1:34:19] everybody catch that
[1:34:21] how can one fathom it
[1:34:24] how can one understand it
[1:34:27] though we cannot do it
[1:34:29] we can accept it by faith
[1:34:32] because God has spoken it
[1:34:39] he said now
[1:34:41] she is beaten
[1:34:43] like beaten gold
[1:34:46] she is handcrafted
[1:34:49] according to the blueprints that our
[1:34:52] spirit given

[1:34:57] to the blueprints

[1:35:10] has given you the light
[1:35:13] Hallelujah God has done something great
[1:35:16] among us all
[1:35:18] brother Branham said outside her Lord
[1:35:20] and Master Jesus Christ was there ever a
[1:35:22] people so beaten and purged as the Bride
[1:35:25] of Jesus Christ
[1:35:29] God takes nothing
[1:35:32] and make something beautiful
[1:35:36] God has raised us up out of the ashes of
[1:35:40] laodocia
[1:35:42] rainbow flags are flying everywhere
[1:35:46] infidels are ruling the church as the
[1:35:48] government is utterly corrupted the
[1:35:50] world is falling apart and God goes in
[1:35:53] and deposits a word in this Dark Age
[1:35:59] and it has nothing to do with you has
[1:36:02] everything to do with God
[1:36:04] how many believe it

[1:36:27] and our spirit is groaning for the full
[1:36:30] adoption we have the earneston of it now
[1:36:33] it is the earnest of our adoption or our
[1:36:36] complete salvation we are waiting for
[1:36:39] the fullness of adoption that will take
[1:36:42] place at the resurrection
[1:36:44] the same holy spirit that saved the
[1:36:47] lutherans that Sanctified the methodists
[1:36:50] that baptized the Pentecostals is Now
[1:36:53] setting in order the coming of the Lord
[1:36:54] Jesus when it will be so powerful that
[1:36:57] body will come into this group of church
[1:36:59] that'll draw the rest of them from the
[1:37:02] grave there will be a resurrection that
[1:37:05] is what the Holy Ghost has given for
[1:37:07] what is the Holy Ghost without us they
[1:37:11] cannot be made perfect when the enemy
[1:37:13] comes in like a flood the Lord will lift
[1:37:16] a standard God will lift a standard it's
[1:37:19] God pouring his spirit it's God moving
[1:37:22] God is waiting on you God is waiting on
[1:37:25] adoption time when he can pour His
[1:37:28] fullness his power his resurrection and
[1:37:31] the church becomes so close to Christ
[1:37:33] that Christ becomes visible among us and
[1:37:37] we go in the rapture
[1:37:41] God placed a word in you
[1:37:44] in the Book of Revelation it says in the
[1:37:46] seventh age he that saith thee amen he
[1:37:50] said what does the amen mean it means
[1:37:52] the so be it it means what God started
[1:37:55] in Genesis God will finish it in
[1:37:58] Revelation let it be so
[1:38:02] what God started God will finish the
[1:38:05] Bible said God will finish his work
[1:38:10] how many believe that
[1:38:12] brother random said now let's hear the
[1:38:14] cap of it all according to Malachi 4 he
[1:38:18] promised to send in the last days he has
[1:38:20] predestinated a church knowing they are
[1:38:24] standing with a seed that has been sown
[1:38:26] he said the holy spirit is in the church
[1:38:28] he said Satan be careful
[1:38:35] why did he say that
[1:38:38] Satan
[1:38:40] be careful
[1:38:43] because the word
[1:38:45] has been sown
[1:38:48] and it has found good ground
[1:38:53] and and everything we have need of is in
[1:38:56] the seed
[1:38:58] and the seed will bring forth of itself
[1:39:02] I know we try our best but that's what
[1:39:04] not what it's about it's believing God
[1:39:07] will fulfill his work
[1:39:11] healing does not come from you it comes
[1:39:13] from believing God will fulfill his word
[1:39:18] coming out of the strongholds of the
[1:39:20] Mind battles and depression anxiety and
[1:39:23] fear and nervousness does not come from
[1:39:25] your overcoming so much as believing
[1:39:28] that God will bring you up
[1:39:33] it is overcoming but it's believing in
[1:39:35] the overcomer
[1:39:37] and we are more than Overcomers
[1:39:43] how many believes he does all things
[1:39:45] well
[1:39:46] the Bible said as Heaven is higher
[1:39:49] than the earth so my ways are higher
[1:39:52] than your ways
[1:39:53] and my thoughts higher than your
[1:39:55] thoughts
[1:39:57] so shall be my word that cometh out of
[1:40:00] my mouth it will not return void it will
[1:40:05] accomplish that where I sent it
[1:40:10] yeah
[1:40:12] praise the Lord
[1:40:15] now watch this
[1:40:18] Zechariah cries
[1:40:21] who art thou
[1:40:23] oh Mountain
[1:40:25] before it's a rubable
[1:40:28] then he placed a word
[1:40:30] against that mountain
[1:40:33] that mountain shall become a plane
[1:40:38] we are up against mountains
[1:40:41] of opposition
[1:40:43] we're in the most unbelieving Dark Age
[1:40:46] the world has ever seen
[1:40:49] false doctrines isms are everywhere
[1:40:52] they're on the increase
[1:40:54] worldliness a worldlyism and materialism
[1:40:57] is on an increase it's it's just
[1:40:59] mind-blowing even among our own
[1:41:03] the spiritual climate is in a decline
[1:41:07] the world is getting darker
[1:41:09] crazier
[1:41:11] and time is running out
[1:41:15] living in a total Dark Age we are going
[1:41:18] against the current
[1:41:21] but God has placed a word
[1:41:24] in The Darkest Hour
[1:41:26] in the weakest generation
[1:41:29] how is God going to pull out his
[1:41:31] masterpiece
[1:41:33] out of something like this
[1:41:37] who art thou whole Mountain
[1:41:40] before zerubbabel
[1:41:43] what is it that stands before your
[1:41:45] victory
[1:41:47] what is it that stands between you and
[1:41:49] the promise
[1:41:51] God has promised peace
[1:41:54] God has promised victory
[1:41:57] God has promised an answer
[1:42:00] why can't we get an answer
[1:42:03] why can't I get peace why can't I reach
[1:42:06] my healing
[1:42:07] why can I not receive what I'm looking
[1:42:10] for who art thou o mountain
[1:42:13] that stands before zeroopable
[1:42:17] who art that enemy that will try to defy
[1:42:21] God's word
[1:42:22] they will try to stand in the way of
[1:42:24] your victory that God has promised you
[1:42:27] who art thou old mountain
[1:42:30] before is Aruba
[1:42:32] it don't matter how great they are me
[1:42:35] how great the opposition how big Goliath
[1:42:39] the word has been placed against our
[1:42:42] enemy thou shall be made a plane
[1:42:46] I will make your way clear
[1:42:49] how many believe that brother Branham
[1:42:51] said we are coming over to the promised
[1:42:54] land and every Mountain must crumble
[1:42:57] every sickness must crumble every demon
[1:43:00] must crumble every obstacle must crumble
[1:43:04] every lion Spirit must crumble
[1:43:08] who art thou Old Mountain before
[1:43:10] zeroopable I want you to say it to your
[1:43:13] mountain tonight
[1:43:14] who are you that'll stand up for me
[1:43:17] God has made me God has a purpose in me
[1:43:21] some of us need to be like jock a bed
[1:43:23] that you gotta let go of it and commit
[1:43:26] it to God
[1:43:27] committed to death and God will bring
[1:43:30] the resurrection we have got to let go
[1:43:32] of our children put them in God's hands
[1:43:35] and watch God bring them back
[1:43:39] we've got a place on our trials in the
[1:43:43] hands of God
[1:43:44] then quit trying to hold on to it
[1:43:46] ourselves come on jock a bit
[1:43:50] sit on out there
[1:43:52] alligators and towels are switching but
[1:43:55] God is greater God sends the Holy Spirit

[1:44:03] to escort you out of your Darkness
[1:44:07] to escort you out of your Valley

[1:44:15] hopelessness
[1:44:17] come on jock a bed
[1:44:20] push that trial out
[1:44:23] commit that to almighty God
[1:44:25] I believe angels of God are all in here

[1:44:30] saying jump in and go swimming
[1:44:34] come on punch on in there
[1:44:37] God you're bigger than my trial

[1:44:44] tonight
[1:44:45] I believe my sickness is leaving
[1:44:48] I believe the devil is leaving
[1:44:50] I believe the tormentors leaving
[1:44:57] come on jock a pit
[1:44:59] got anointed that little faith woman
[1:45:02] it's against the nature of a mother to
[1:45:05] push her baby out there
[1:45:06] but she trusted God
[1:45:09] more than she feared the enemy
[1:45:12] you've got to trust God more than you
[1:45:14] fear your security and fear the
[1:45:16] circumstances you need to let go of it
[1:45:19] tonight
[1:45:22] and I can imagine she goes in Jesus name
[1:45:27] all the crocodile smell starts swarming
[1:45:32] she could have panicked and run back out
[1:45:35] there and grabbed it but she didn't
[1:45:37] she said Lord into thine hands
[1:45:41] I come in this baby

[1:45:52] Angels come pouring out of them beams
[1:45:55] and they lying all the banks of the
[1:45:58] Jordan
[1:45:59] or the Nile
[1:46:01] in this little sacred Ark
[1:46:06] going into the missing the whirlpools
[1:46:10] and the Devil comes to swallow the
[1:46:13] deliver but God had a word on him
[1:46:16] stop him
[1:46:18] he said I'll destroy you I imagine he
[1:46:22] turned white and turned duck-tailed and
[1:46:24] run
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:34] the angel
[1:46:39] this is the safest place in the world
[1:46:43] right in the will of God
