see the salvation of the lord o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the lord will be with you amen the next verse jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord worshiping the lord and the levites of the children of catholics and of the children of korite stood up to praise the lord of god god of israel with a loud voice on high and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekkon and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall you be established believe his prophets so shall you prosper and when he consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth forever and when they began to sing in praise the lord said ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which were come against judah and they were smitten for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir utterly delay and destroy them and without made an end of the inhabitants of seer everyone helped to destroy another and when judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness they looked into the multitude and behold there were dead bodies falling to the earth and none escaped and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead

for your glory speak father we pray in jesus name amen amen let's turn to hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8. also exodus chapter 16 and john chapter 6. amen hebrews 13 and verse 8 says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen i'm so thankful for that scripture amen that word that bread amen that we can feed upon in the time of our trouble to know though no matter what troubles we're in he's still the same god circumstances doesn't change who he is amen exodus 16 and verse 15 and when the children of israel saw it they said one to another it is manna for they waste not what it was and moses said unto them this is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat verse 31 and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey and moses said this is the thing which the lord commandeth feel an armor of it to be kept for your generations that you may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt and moses said unto aaron take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept for your generations as the lord commandeth moses so didn't air so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept and the children of israel did eat manna forty years until they came into the land inhabited they did eat manna until they came to the borders of the land of canaan also john chapter 6 and verse 48 he says i am that bread of life your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and are dead but this is the bread which is coming down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world amen we'll let you be seated i'd like to speak to you tonight on jesus christ the same the living bread amen the living bread it's a bread of life it's a bread that sustains it's a bread that amen that heals and delivers you know i thought you could read the story and we didn't read all of it about the children of israel as they would come out of the land of egypt and and they would come across the red sea and you know and he's walking through a desert and in the desert there's not very much uh you know there's not a walmart or something that you can just walk into or gardens here and there fruit trees that you can pick from there's very very little to survive upon from from in a desert and they begin to cry out to the lord and their cries was not in the sense of asking but it was in the sense of complaining and they began to complain to the lord about having nothing to eat and they began to cry out and say you know we had low cloves and we had this and we had every kind of thing to eat in egypt why did you bring us out here to die and the lord was actually very wroth with him but in his grace and his mercy he would provide for them you know i believe if they would have just asked he would have provided you know they didn't have to complain they didn't have to shout they didn't have to scream they didn't have to say god what what you know do you care that we perished it wasn't about that all they had to do was ask and they would receive amen because he is the sustainer of life he is the creator of life amen nothing is too hard for the lord so it doesn't matter amen if you're in the desert or if you're in places that you can't get your own supplier and you can't supply your own needs he's more than enough for any situation amen and he would show this time for 40 years as they would go down to the down to the wilderness and and he would rain down manna every every morning for them to eat he would show him every day i am the provider you don't have to get up one day and worry about it i'll provide for that day you don't have to get up the next day and worry about it i will provide for that day he was showing the attributes of himself as he would reign down this manna now brother branham would say it like this he said now moses he didn't have the ovens he didn't have the ability he couldn't do this they do this on his own amen it wasn't even it wasn't anything moses could provide he said but the creator every morning would drop this angel food down to them amen and he would he would provide for them and and i believe he's that same kind of god for us to see this evening i believe that no matter where we're at whether we may be in a desert or we may be wherever we may be we know that we cannot take care of ourselves we know that we're frail human beings and it's impossible as a human being to get up in the morning to realize what that day is going to hold you never know what a day is going to hold but you can you can have this confidence that he holds tomorrow that he is more than able for whatever situation or whatever i'm going through and he has the provisions for my needs he has the provisions for my health he has a he has the provisions that brother brandon would say there were so many vitamins packed in this manner as it would fall to where not even they wouldn't even get sick they wouldn't even you know their souls and their shoes wouldn't even wear out he said because god was providing every step of the way and i don't believe that god has come in this age that we've lived in and living in and god has done all the things that he's done and he's called out of a people out of a church and he's called a bride out of a church or he's called a people to himself as a people to his name amen to bring them to this place to say now you go ahead and you take care of yourself you go ahead and you see what you can do for yourself no he's still the same yesterday today and forever so he is supplying for our needs even when we can't see him provide he is coming on our behalf even we can't see him working on our behalf he is showing time after time after time he is the sustainer he is the need supplier he is the healer he is the deliverer he's everything that we ever would have need of amen between here and the rapture hallelujah there's not a day that surprises him there's not a day that he wakes up or comes and looks down here on earth and he said wow i didn't realize it was going to be that bad i i didn't realize it was going to be that tough you know maybe i don't have the answer no he has the answer for every day it does not matter how dark the day is it does might not matter how bad the day may seem it does not matter how sick you are it does not matter what what oppression is upon you he has the answer for every day amen he has a supply for every day amen i believe he is the word amen in our hour to give us sustaining strength you know brother branham would that be asked a question and i was what i thought this was very wonderful as we look at these things he he was asked the question what did jesus mean in saint john 21 15 and 17 when he asked peter if he loved him and told him to feed his lambs then he said feed my sheep he said see christ is the shepherd he was going away but he was going he was leaving the commission of his sheep in other words he was going to make sure his sheep was taken care of hallelujah which any shepherd feeds his flock he he takes care of him he makes sure that he supplies their needs he makes sure that there's something there for every situation and he was leaving the commission to his disciples to continue the work to continue to feed the flock to be the shepherd to feed the sheep amen he said see here this morning that's what i'm doing he says sheep will only grow as you give them sheep food he said if you fry up a big hamburger and you try to give it to a sheep he couldn't grow on that that's not sheep food if you try to grill a nice t-bone steak and fix it all up every good as it may be but try to give it to a sheep that's not sheep food he couldn't grow on that but when you're to feed the flock of god that shows that you don't feed them some man-made theology you don't feed them some man-made creeds or dogmas you feed them on the word of god amen feed them the word be a shepherd a true shepherd feed my sheep i want well you know a true shepherd can he does not try to feed the sheep his complexes or his fears or his unbelief but no he takes the word of god and he puts it out there for them to eat he studies he shows himself to be approved a workman that not needed to be ashamed and he goes to the word what is he coming through trying to find the food needed for the season trying to find the food needed for the moment because god has a food for the moment amen of strength giving food for the moment amen you know how it was when you was going through sicknesses something would be dropped into your heart amen a quote or a scripture amen it would give you such strength in the moment god has strength for the moment he has food for the moment he has the power for the moment he has the word for the moment this word is an up-to-date word it's not a word of yesterday although it had power yesterday it's not a word of tomorrow although it has power for tomorrow but this word is spiritual food in due season in this moment and this time when i have need of a god who are answered by fire he has a word for that moment when i have need of a god who can heal and perform the miraculous he has a word for that moment [Applause] hallelujah he said men's man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god is that right he said if a man is to live and they are the flock of god the church of god then they can only thrive upon the word and manner of god and this is his manna he said the word this is his manna in the bible we come through the church all over it over there in the church ages jesus is the hidden manner hallelujah he you can read about it he would tell us amen that the overcomers are going to receive the hidden manner amen things that have been hidden down through the ages and what was it the overcomer of luther received the hidden manner for their moment it was a moment where the just shall live by faith and they grabbed a hold of that manna and they withstood the catholic church hallelujah john wesley would come along and the hidden manner would be revealed in this moment amen sanctify of the word of sanctification and they would withstand the sins of the world and they would withstand the thing why by the strength of the word and due season amen the word of the moment amen to manna he says in the old testament was that which came down from heaven fresh every night to sustain the church and his journey it's the new testament in the new testament what is the hidden manner a little while and the world sees me no more amen i'm going to become hidden and the world see me no more yet ye shall see me hallelujah amen he wouldn't say that in his word unless it was true to be in his word amen he wouldn't say the word won't see me but you will see me the world won't know me but you will know me the world won't understand but you'll understand the world won't be able to understand those strengths you've got to stand in the moment of your trials and your temptation but they don't realize you're eating on some hidden manna you're eating on some things of god that's been revealed to you for your moment and time that you're living in hallelujah he said and christ is that hidden manner that comes from god out of heaven fresh every day oh hallelujah amen he's fresh every day his mercies are new every morning hallelujah it's a fresh outpouring every day amen if you haven't been receiving that you need to start going out and gathering that amen to have that fresh outpouring of god every day amen to have that moment with him every day listen though the experiences with christ is not a one-and-done affair it's every day his mercies is new every morning hallelujah there's a word for you every morning there's a power for you every morning there's overcoming power that's delivered to you every morning hallelujah he's the hidden manner that comes out of god god comes from god out of heaven fresh every day you say well two weeks ago i had a great experience he said what about right now what about right now you're saying well brother tell me that i'm in a trial i don't feel like i'm a christian i don't i don't feel like god loves me they went out every morning and every day there was in the desert but god was still their sustainer every day was not a good day but that god was still their sustainer every moment wasn't a happy moment but god was still their sustainer hallelujah he says what about right now every day ought to be a fresh and new blessing a new something coming from god the hidden manna coming down from god out of heaven and he said we feast upon this manner which is christ and he sustains us to the journey till we reach the other side oh hallelujah take that devil amen i got something that'll give me strength every morning every day it don't matter what i go through there's something i can feed on that'll lift me up that'll push me forward that'll bring me another step amen when the devil thought well surely they had done gave up by now he's not realizing what we're feeding on we're not feeding on a temporary word we're not feeding on a temporary power we're feeding on the body word of the son of man the fresh man out of heaven is falling every day i encourage you start taking a bite this is what he told john in revelations 10 he said you come and take the book and you eat the book amen it's time we start eating the book eating the word of god amen eating what god has given us every day well you say well i got it on sunday and wednesday what about monday tuesday and thursday and friday and saturday he said that's what he meant by feeding my sheep he said i he said we may not ever get to the rest of the question because that's a good one for me i like that when i talk of christ be in the manner the food for the sheep feed them christ from his word take the word of christ exactly the way it's wrote here and give it to the sheep no matter what anybody else says all they need a hamburger don't believe that here's what they need right here this is it give them this this is sheep food this is what makes them grow the holy spirit this is his word this is his commission the word is a seed the seed brings forth a plant and the plant we begin to heat this is what brings forth the plant that the holy spirit thrives on in the church it feeds upon it feeds the church the holy spirit does rejoicing in the presence of god because that's what that's because that the people is believing his word and letting him work through them and giving them the very things that god promised them that they would do and god is seeing his church growing therefore the sheep's being fed and the holy spirit's being glorified that's it feed my sheep now we know that the story would be or the it would go is that they had to only they could only take as much it would supply them for that day because every morning they had to go gather a new manner they couldn't gather you know be build my way have a big bucket and go out and get them a week's worth and set it in their house or go get two days worth they can only get one day's worth amen because god wanted to show them i'm fresh every day it was showing an attribute of himself he's wanting to show that way we can look at that and we can say he's a fresh experience every day it ought to be we're falling in love with jesus more and more every day hallelujah amen see if he said we try to keep it over it's going to spoil he said that's what's the matter with a lot of people we keep it over i had an experience 20 years ago but that experience has got wiggle tales in it today what about right now well you say well i received the baptism the holy ghost and i got joy and peace and long suffering but what about now that experience back there is done gone what about a new one today each day they gather new manner and manna is the type of perfect type of the holy ghost coming from god to sustain you the sustainer to take them through the wilderness as a spirit is a sustainer for us to take us through our journey we're on our road to the promised land what promised land in my father's house is many mansions if it wasn't so i would have told you i've gone to prepare a place for you that's a manner right there amen that i can gather strength from that my god hasn't forgot about me amen my god is preparing for me he's got a table set for me he's got a plate set for me he's got food on the table he's ready we're fed daily by the holy gho daily daily daily somebody say daily we're fed daily by the holy spirit coming down from god out of heaven sweet to our souls like honey and the rock i have to have it every hour of my life or i die that's true it has to come to me or i can't live it has to come to you or you won't live it talks about miriam you know i'm gonna go through quite a bit of quotes so bear with me mariam got in the spirit picked up a tambourine and went down the bank beating the tambourine all the daughters of israel following her dancing in the spirit moses put up his hands and singing the spirit he said that ain't a holy road of meat and i ain't never seen anyone in my life that's right they sure was going down the banks rejoicing and signs and wonders among them when they got thirsty god just poured water out of a rock when they got hungry god just ran manna down out of heaven when they got this manner they began to eat it and it tasted like honey you know what manna was a type of the holy spirit just after every believer has come to the red sea which represents the blood of jesus christ he comes in the fellowship by the holy spirit by the manner god is raining down every day they come out from and when they come now he said talks about the journey in the time of the holy spirit he said when they come out of judaism and got the holy ghost on the day of pentecost the holy ghost rained out upon these apostles and has rained ever since hello somebody and it's rained ever since and will till this age is over amen hallelujah and will to this age is over he said i want you to notice as soon as the rain off the manor of the manor began to fall he told aaron go out and get several big home or get armor full and put it in the holy of holies and every generation that precedes this generation every time a man becomes a priest he can come in behind the holies of holies and take a mouthful of the original manna that fell at the beginning oh my my my now under the old covenant excuse me under the old covenant they had they could only be priests that could go into certain places they could so you could somebody could go in the outer court but then there was the inner court then there was a holy of holies and and it was only a priest that could go in once a year and inside of this holy of holies was an armor full of manner that it rained down of the original outpouring and it come and god said you go take that and you put it inside of the holy of holies and inside of there it won't decay inside of there it won't it won't get worms in it and i want it there for every priest when every generation when a new generation raises up they have the right to have the same bite as the first generation had oh hallelujah amen but i want you to understand when jesus came the fulfillment of the manna he tore the the the curtain apart and he took it to where anyone he took the middle wall of partition down to where you as anyone could go and you could go into the holy of holies and you can receive the baptism of the holy ghost amen he would make you a royal priesthood a holy nation and god would pour it out as he did on the first day and you as a people would have a right in this day to have the same bite they got in the first day [Applause] [Music] hallelujah what fell at the beginning he said what a beautiful picture was in the day of pentecost when our spiritual manner failed to take care of the church and it put in that church spiritual vitamins hallelujah it was such vitamins in that church that when they walked into the gate called beautiful there was so much vitamins they had aten just a few days before they looked at that lame man and said silver and gold have i none but i got some vitamins for you it won't make you rich but it'll make you walk it'll get out of your own conditions and it'll cause you to leap and shout for joy and to give glory unto god such as i have give unto thee what they do they tore a piece of that manohar and they placed it down there and the same spirit that fell on them fell on that boy and he jumped to his feet ankle bones came right leg bones got strength amen there was such power in that first falling that i let that a dead woman could be raised to lie that a man with palsy could be healed that men that were in jail houses they could pray and angels would visit and they would come out free men that's what fell on the first day he said we can have it on the last day [Music] [Applause] it's the same manner it's the very same manner it's not something new it's the same [Applause] oh my god we are now again writing another book of acts amen the same manner that fell in that book of acts has now fell upon a group of people how many is hate of that same man [Applause] hallelujah i say take another bible and start prophesying let the redeemed of the lord say so amen god is moving in our midst god is moving in an impossible situation god is changing scenes god is moving when we can't see him moving he's working when we can't see him working i know he is i know he's in our fire even told me he was hallelujah and if he's in a fire he's gonna do what he did the first time

would reach down and get some honey out of that script bag and he would lay it on a rock hallelujah and the sheep would come and go to licking on the rock and while they was licking on the rock they got a hold of the limestone hallelujah and the limestone healed the sick sheep he said what a picture he said brother we got the same a whole lot of script bag plum full of hunting tonight and i'm

generation under the last seed is going to eat of that same manner this last one that's going to walk into the ark it's going to take a bite full of that same matter that fell on pentecost [Applause] we're going to lay these words on jesus open my bible the other day so he was looking at these things that we're dealing with and there was some manner that fell out said contend before the mountains and the hills oh my god man of this being poured out i wish i could find that man that fell just last night maybe i can somebody got that i've sent it to the family it's isaiah somewhere that's some good mountain good i think i may have found it nope it's there it's mana it's falling every day it's falling every moment in your time is ezekiel it's falling listen this man we came over brother ill and his family came over yesterday had supper but the tim would come from the hospital we'd talk and visit would pray the spirit of the lord would come into our living room i'd reach over as i did just the other day and that other scripture would fall i opened my bible and fell open to this scripture also thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of israel and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god because the enemy has said against you aha don't you know the lord knows the enemy's voice and when he speaks against you he said aha even the anxious high places are in our possessions therefore prophesy and say thus saith the lord god because they have made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side that you might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen and you're taken up in the lips of the talkers and are in infamy of the people therefore ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills and to the rivers and to the valleys to the desolate wastes into the cities that are forsaken which become a prey and derision unto the residue of the healing that are round about therefore thus saith the lord god surely the fire my jealousy have outspoken against the residue of the heathen against all which have appointed my land unto their possessions with the joy of all their hearts with the spiteful minds that cast it out for a prey prophesy their concern in the land of israel and say unto the mountains and to the hills and to the rivers and the valleys thus saith the lord god behold i've spoken in my jealousy and my fury because you born the shame of the heathen therefore saith the lord god i have lifted up my hands surely the heathen that are about you they shall bear their shame but ye o mountains of israel you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to a people of israel for they are at hand to come and behold i am for you and i will turn unto you and you shall be tilled and sown and i'll multiply men upon you and all the houses of israel even all of it and the cities shall be inhabited and the waste shall be builded and i'll multiply upon you men and beasts and they shall increase and bring forth fruit i will settle you after your old estate hallelujah going back to the land of the book the people of the book going back to the original outpouring of the holy ghost i will settle you to the original part the oldest state and will do better unto you than at your beginnings and ye shall know that i am the lord lick on that a while we're not going to turn into desolation we're not going to fall down into ruin we're not going to go down into nothing but he's going to blew over us and he's going to move over us and we're going to bring forth fruit and we're going to bring forth sons and daughters and we're going to bring forth our healed and our deliverer and our set free and god's going to give us more now than he did at the beginning hallelujah and ye shall know that i am the lord he said the word is a seed and it begins to bring forth from the sun the s-o-n strikes it the s-o-n has got to be upon the seed to make it bare and to make it come forth that's the only way you can take the word see take the word of god in your heart and walk into the shekinah glory and when you do manna he said that it's only given to a separated people that's right the only the only one that can eat it that's permitted to eat it as people who are permitted and knows it people paul said it's changing you from glory to glory and finally you see it comes back till it's back to this original glory it's just like a seed of a morning glory the seed of a flower it falls into the ground the seed of a corn falls what's the first thing comes up a little sprout goes into the tassel tassel back all the way to the original grain that's exactly what the church has done it's come from luther wesley back to the original grain back to original glory back to the glory was at the beginning the sun that rose in the east is the same sun that's manifesting the same thing in the west changing from glory to glory it changed from pagan down into luther from luther down the wesley from wesley out into pentecost on and on changing from glory to glory producing that hidden manner but now it's ripe and it's bringing him back exactly like he was at the beginning hello somebody hey you know just in case somebody out there is wondering this is 64. it's bringing him back exactly like he was at the beginning the sun that rose has come back again it's come back exactly producing that hidden manner exactly like he was at the beginning his same ministry the same jesus the same power the same holy ghost the same one that came down on the day of pentecost the same holy ghost that manifested today from glory to glory to glory it's back to the original sea with the baptism of the holy ghost because it'll have the same signs it'll have the same wonders it'll have the same baptism it'll be the same kind of people they'll be acting the same way they'll have the same power they'll have the same sensation from glory hello somebody the same sensation from glory unto glory change all the way from this body into a body like his own glorious body where we shall see him hallelujah this is what is taking place keep eating the keep eating the word of god keep feeding on thus faith the lord keep standing on my i am the same yesterday today and forever critics sure they're gonna rise up to be honest with you i feel sorry for them to be honest with you i feel sorry for them because if they would humble themselves they could have a taste and when they ever get a taste of this they'll no longer be a critic they'll be a believer but they don't want to humble themselves they're too afraid what might happen well i might shout i might dance i might speak with tongues i might do all kinds of things who cares as long as you eat no manna i'm in good lands people can do all kinds of things eating on carrying of the world i mean they act like fools getting drunk act like fools getting on high on dope they act like got people preachers so-called preachers of this message wanted to stand up and call wildfire tommy wright wildfire i doubt their experience they're blaspheming the holy ghost they want us so wow i tell you what i wish the holy ghost touched me he said i'll touch you i'll knock you what kind of man is that he's a fool and he's not a fool for christ he's a fool for that evil spirit he's hiding behind because this will change you from glory to glory i want to make fun of young kids out rejoicing in the things of god go ahead and make fun go ahead and go on going out back to egypt go ahead and have a barren church go ahead and have people that can't sit on you no more because of your tyrant attitude go ahead do what you want to do but that's for me in my house i'm going to keep eating manna i'm going to keep eating the goodness of god oh taste and see don't taste and see that god is good and his mercy endureth forever taste and see what he'll do for a young person taste and see what he'll do for a sick person taste and see what he'll do for a cancer and alopecia and brain bleeds in every kind of spirit oh taste and see that the lord is good it's honey in the rock i say give me some more

[Music] he is awake he is alert he is looking at your star and he's looking at it right now with angry eyes through the eyes of the holy ghost i rebuke you satan go back from where you came hallelujah there's honey in the rock for karen pruitt it's being poured out even right now he's the lord god that heals all our diseases doesn't matter what the doctor's report says i will believe the report of the lord i will believe what god said and god's word says let me put it on jesus god's word says she's healed deliver i will restore saith the lord what the first brain bleed took what the second brain bleed took what the third one what the fourth one fifth sixth however many i will restore look on that one christ's a solid rock this world is shaking this world is falling but there's a bride standing on thus saith the lord [Applause] this is a long time ago when they used to have a have a rock they called it a mad stone and i looked this up because you know and heard about it my day but it's called it was a home remedy used for centuries to heal though that says not a common practice today a mad stone sometimes called a bazaar stone is used to lay on a bite or a wound and to draw the poison out it works by absorbing all the poison bit by bit curing the bites by detoxifying it completely he said when they would get bit by a mad dog they would have a mad stone and they would stick it and if it stuck to that and they left it there they got well if they didn't they died he said the worst mad dog i know of is the devil he said the only cure i know up for it is the rock of ages stick to it hold on to it and god will take care of it he said little boy here in the wheelchair you're blind sir you're laying on the cart holding god's unchanging hand the devil might have bit you but there's enough drawing power in the rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee the devil can't get you when you're hidden there stick with it hold on to it don't let it away from you no matter how many of the symptoms i'm staying right with it no matter how bad it gets i'm staying right with it stay there until the healing power has drawn all the disease away he will do it oh praise the name of the lord he said what happens the manner will begin to fall every morning he said they tried to keep some of it over he got wiggle tails in it he says what's the matter with a lot of pentecostal experience or depending on testifying on something that happened years ago them experience gets wiggletails why not get a fresh one hallelujah every day with jesus is sweeter than the day before this is a theme all the way down through you just you look at it it talks about the original manna what it was came to the holy of holies worms couldn't get in it laid back to every person entered the priesthood had a right to taste he said what a beautiful type it is on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost fell down from heaven our manna after we come to the blood been saved and cleansed from our sins the holy ghost fell peter said it's for you and for your children for them that are far off it hold to that well what about my chill hold to that amen amen is our lord the god our lord to call and lord our god shall call and every person that enters the baptism of the spirit can have that same kind of holy ghost that they got on the day of pentecost not something that looked like it but the real thing same kind of holy spirit that falls back there falls now the same kind the real holy ghost brings forth the same kind of evidence the same proofs that they had back then comes with the same power the same holy ghost it's real just as real as it's ever been just the same holy spirit that fell back there on the day of pentecost oh he said friends let's look at it honey he said what was that man of the wafer it tasted like honey he said honey in the rock for you that's the type of the holy spirit amen god's got something for you brother i'm telling you he says every man that pay the price and step out for christ has the right to receive the baptism not something you make up but the original like phil in the beginning like they had on the day of pentecost hallelujah the holy ghost is a real product you don't have to receive some duplicate or something wait till you get a taste of the original manna that fell on the day of pentecost there there was receive the holy ghost you know what's the matter with the church today it needs a good old-time saint paul revival and the holy bible holy ghost taught in it again takes fire coming down from heaven wow but we have a right to the original jesus would again show this in matthew 14. actually all the gospels but i take this one matthew 14 and verse 15 said when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place huh a desert place he's going to show them again i'm the lord of creation in a desert place they would discuss it times past ain't time for them to go get something we send a multitude that they may go in the villages and maybe confine themselves some vigils but jesus said unto them they need not depart depart give them to eat this is what he's telling his people again you don't have to depart i got something for you don't walk away brother wayne would preach it he said you're in position for a miracle he said don't get out of line stay in line until you receive your piece of bread they said on them well we're here i hear these five loaves and two fishes he said bring them hither to me and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and he took the five loaves and two fishes looking up to heaven he blessed it and break and gave the loaves of his disciples and the disciples to the multitude and they did all we eat and were filled brother brandon would say this is also he would type it again to every ministry the ministries of the seven church age messengers they would receive and then they would give they'd receive and they would give what they received they gave amen and they did what all eight five thousand men beside women and children they did all eat five loaves of bread two fish but true he looked up to heaven and he blessed it and he break it he tore a piece off and he handed it tore a piece off and handed it tore a piece off and he handed it tore peace off not gonna run out of holy ghost not gonna run out of power not gonna run out of the ability to heal the sick not going to run out of the ability to call the prodigals home not going to run out of the sp showing himself he's got power enough for every person he wouldn't at all be saved but they got to take the bread there might have been somebody there that said i ain't eating that i don't know i don't i think that'd be pretty foolish but there may have been somebody like that so i'm tired i'm ready to go i'm hungry and they went tried to find they may have died just a few steps away i don't know but they just stayed in line he's tearing it off i heard i heard this brother wayne talking about staying in your position i ain't got out of position i've stayed right there because i know he's going to tear off a piece of bread because he's the lord of creation it does not matter how black it may seem how dark it may seem he has the ability to pull off bread and there'll be more bread pull off healing and there'll be more healing pull off deliverance and there'd be more deliverance pull off salvation and there'd be more salvation pull off the holy ghost and there'd be more holy ghost he's the lord of creation don't get out of line and after they had eaten they took up the fragments that remain 12 baskets full he was showing himself again as jehovah jireh more than enough not just enough but more than enough so it shows me that when he come down in this age he's not running out he hasn't come to my moment when i need him and he don't have enough virtue in him to write i can receive what i have need of he's here to tear off another piece of bread brother and would say you want an amazing he would tear that off he said it went past the growing stage the planning the growing the harvesting the sifting the baking the kneading the baking the ovens went past all of that there's another piece there's another piece you know there was some men that were walking on the road to emmaus that was discouraged not realizing that same prophecy be fulfilled not realizing the greatest thing that ever happened in human history it just happened he rose from the dead and they're walking along and they're talking about their sorrows and their troubles and they're sad and while they're looking around and thinking how bad it is and it's so dark disciples don't know what to do nobody knows what to do out of the bushes steps somebody and he starts walking with them and he's walking and he's talking he starts saying he said why why are you sad why why is your countenance falling why are you downhearted what's wrong well you must be you must not be from around here you you must you must not know what's been going on and don't you know that our our master was crucified and they laid him in a tomb and he's been dead now now there's stories going his body's disappeared and we don't know what's happening and he began to break bread he began to tear off scriptures and hand it to him and show them this promise and this promise and what god did all the way draw the way from genesis all the way down showing them who he was and they get to the place where they're going and they go to turn in and the scripture says he makes as if he's going to go on and they restrained him he said no come in come fellowship with us what you've been telling me has been encouraging i want more of it lord i desire more from me father i i i don't want just that just what i had i want more is there anybody here tonight that's wanting to restrain him just a bit and say lord i need a fresh experience i need more of you father i i've had i've had moves of the holy ghost and i've had you touch my life but i want more all you got to do is restrain him ask him say father come by my way right now speak to me and he comes down he walks into the room and brother branham said they sat down they ordered some bread and some vittles and things and said he's sitting there and he said he reached and he done something familiar now i've been pondering on this i've been looking at this because you know i i personally don't believe it was just a certain way he held the bread i believe that when he tore it off another piece appeared showing who he is wouldn't matter how a man holds a piece of bread but it matters if a man tears off a piece and another piece appears that matters and he would take it and the scripture said when they saw him do that their eyes are open there he is i say he's about to do something familiar tear off a piece of bread and another one appear showing he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the lord of creation and every devil has to bow how many right now i just say lord bow your heads and raise your hand say lord that's you say stand to your feet whatever you want to do walk to this altar say lord i want a piece of that bread tonight i want another dose of that man lord i want more of that lord jesus i want you father in my life i want a piece of that bread do something familiar feed us tonight lord touch us lord oh yes lord i need a piece of bread for my healing lord i i need a priest piece of bread for my family father i need a piece of bread for my mother lord i i need a piece of bread i'm receiving it right now in jesus name i waited a lot of weeks for it but i'm receiving my peace because he's the lord of creation hallelujah hallelujah i'll receive it tonight church i just feel his presence is sweeping him hallelujah don't get out of line don't get out of lying church that's what brother brandon would scream get back in line get back in line you're on the right track get back in line one day he's gonna pull off a piece of bread and hand it to us it's gonna cause our bodies to change from this dimension into another don't get out of line hallelujah get your piece of bread lord i can't even already talk anymore lord pour it out from heaven jesus move lord in a familiar way yourself to be the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah jesus hallelujah the same
