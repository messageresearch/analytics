[43:08] brings
[43:09] peace amen Faith brings peace John
[43:12] chapter 14 and verse one says let not
[43:15] your heart be troubled you believe in
[43:18] God believe also in Me In My Father's
[43:21] House house or many mansions if it were
[43:24] not so I would have told you but I go to
[43:27] prepare a place for you and if I go and
[43:29] prepare a place for you I will come
[43:31] again and receive you unto myself that
[43:35] where I am there you may be
[43:37] also and whether I go you know and the
[43:40] way you know down to verse 25 these
[43:43] things have I spoken unto you being yet
[43:45] present with you but the comforter which
[43:48] is the Holy Ghost whom the father was
[43:50] send in my name he shall teach you all
[43:53] things and bring all things to your
[43:55] remembrance whatsoever
[43:57] I have said unto you peace I leave with
[44:00] you my peace I give unto you not as the
[44:04] world giveth give I unto you let not
[44:07] your heart be troubled neither Let It Be
[44:11] Afraid amen we'll let you be
[44:19] seated we could of course read the
[44:22] scriptures in Timothy and Daniel of the
[44:25] last days perilous time shall come and
[44:28] or a time of trouble such as never was
[44:31] seen and we know that we're living in
[44:34] that time we're living at the very
[44:36] closing of time and and we know that
[44:38] it's getting darker and darker as each
[44:41] day
[44:42] progresses you know and many times when
[44:45] we don't uh when we don't see how things
[44:48] will turn out or we don't know how
[44:49] things are going to turn out we tend to
[44:51] worry and we tend to fret and this
[44:54] allows doubt to rise in our hearts
[44:57] and because we can't see with our eyes
[45:00] and how the story ends you know it it
[45:02] allows doubt to come and and and if
[45:04] you're not careful it'll it'll turn even
[45:06] to to unbelief you know I was I was
[45:09] looking at this thought and I ran across
[45:11] something that was very interesting I
[45:14] I've heard about this before of of a
[45:17] moose how a moose is very dangerous
[45:19] actually if you're up there in the in
[45:22] the in the north there in the in the
[45:24] winter country and things and on the
[45:25] snowmobile or skis you have to watch out
[45:28] for them more than you do grizzly bears
[45:30] and the reason why is they they're so
[45:32] aggressive is they don't have good
[45:34] eyesight and a moose you know it's
[45:37] becomes very aggressive because it has
[45:38] poor eyesight and and and when you have
[45:41] poor eyesight you view everything is a
[45:43] threat and you know and when we can't
[45:45] see the future we tend to feel
[45:48] threatened you know if we don't know how
[45:50] things will go worry sets in and we
[45:53] become afraid and and we and you know
[45:56] maybe don't know how the empy how our
[45:57] employment is going to go or job's going
[45:59] to go or how our life's going to turn
[46:01] out and and we feel threatened but God
[46:04] gives us an alter alternative to this
[46:06] feeling of threatened or being afraid
[46:09] and that's to trust amen you know Faith
[46:12] brings trust and Trust brings fa uh
[46:16] peace trust isn't something you can
[46:18] choose because you feel like it amen
[46:21] it's not something that you choose
[46:22] because you feel like trusting but we
[46:24] have faith in a God who has a word that
[46:27] will not fail and we trust though we
[46:30] cannot see with our natural senses and
[46:33] and we can have a peace in the middle of
[46:34] our storm and you choose to believe no
[46:37] matter what and Trust follows see faith
[46:40] is something you choose even when you
[46:42] feel anything but calm amen you choose
[46:46] it even if you feel worry or you feel
[46:48] doubt creeping in amen you have to turn
[46:50] back to Faith and that faith will bring
[46:53] a trust and that trust will bring a
[46:55] peace even when you cannot see the
[46:57] answer even though the circumstances are
[47:00] blurry and your vision of of the of the
[47:02] future is unclear faith will give you a
[47:05] trust and Trust will give you a peace we
[47:08] can read that about that in Isaiah
[47:10] chapter 26 and verse three it says Thou
[47:12] will keep him in perfect peace whose
[47:15] mind is stayed on thee because he what
[47:18] trusteth in thee amen because of this
[47:21] trust it brings a perfect peace amen
[47:24] that in the middle of struggles in the
[47:26] mid of perilous times or uh time uh uh
[47:29] the time like of trouble like never
[47:31] before amen we can still have a trust
[47:34] because there's a word that cannot fail
[47:37] there's a God who stands behind his word
[47:40] and it's what he said in John Chapter 14
[47:42] verse 27 he said Peace I give I live
[47:46] with thee my peace I give unto you not
[47:49] as the world giveth give I unto you let
[47:52] not your heart be troubled neither Let
[47:54] It Be Afraid in other words this isn't a
[47:56] peace P that that's that depending upon
[47:58] how the world is going or how the
[48:01] economy is going or how things are
[48:03] around you and your circumstances this
[48:06] ain't the peace that he gives us you
[48:07] know if we're depending on our own peace
[48:09] and our own comfort and things you know
[48:12] it can only it's only a temporary thing
[48:14] cuz sooner or later you go through a
[48:16] trial you go through sickness you go
[48:18] through something you didn't see coming
[48:20] and then that peace will leave you but
[48:22] if you have the peace of God in your
[48:24] heart that peace of God is Not depending
[48:27] upon what the world is doing or what the
[48:29] world is saying or how it's How many
[48:31] missiles are being fired here or what's
[48:33] happening over here that peace of God is
[48:36] depending only upon his word and that
[48:38] word has never failed one time that word
[48:41] is something we can stand upon Amen in
[48:44] the darkest of hours and the darkest of
[48:46] times it's something that you can really
[48:48] trust you may not can trust man's words
[48:51] or the president's words or or or
[48:53] anybody's words but you can trust God's
[48:55] word because he cannot lie he said if it
[48:58] wasn't the truth I would have told you
[49:00] so I would have told you amen exactly
[49:03] what was going to be and this is the way
[49:05] where he was telling us let not your
[49:07] heart be troubled but believe in me have
[49:10] faith in me that I'm going to go and
[49:12] prepare a place for you and there where
[49:14] I am you may be also cuz in my father's
[49:17] house are many
[49:19] mansions I don't know about you but I I
[49:21] like how it's been said before I'm not
[49:24] looking for necessarily a great Mansion
[49:26] a five bedroom room house or or whatever
[49:28] I'm looking for a mansion about this
[49:30] tall and dark-headed Dark Eyed Amen in
[49:33] perfect health and perfect peace never
[49:35] have a
[49:36] brain a mind trouble or or never have
[49:40] heart trouble never have anything like
[49:42] that again no sickness no worry that's
[49:44] the kind of mansion I'm looking for I
[49:46] don't know about you but I don't I ain't
[49:48] interested in exactly what house I'm
[49:50] going to live in or if there even be a
[49:52] house I'm not worried about all of that
[49:54] I know he has went to prepare me a Bo
[49:57] body amen a body that I can dwell in
[50:00] throughout eternity that will not Decay
[50:02] or grow old amen what a Manion that is
[50:06] amen so our faith must rest in God's
[50:09] word that will not fail and then we can
[50:12] have a trust that will produce peace in
[50:15] the middle of your storm so we're in
[50:17] perilous times and it's getting worse
[50:19] we're in a time of trouble and it's
[50:21] getting worse but at that time if we
[50:23] finish that scripture in the time of
[50:25] trouble but at at that time his people
[50:28] shall be
[50:30] delivered everyone whose name is written
[50:33] on the book they shall be delivered how
[50:35] many's thankful for that word right
[50:37] there because we're in a time of trouble
[50:39] and it's getting worse and it's going to
[50:41] get
[50:43] worse but we should know Amen in this
[50:46] moment we can if we can trust that and
[50:48] we can see that being fulfilled then why
[50:50] won't the rest of it be fulfilled it
[50:52] will be fulfilled amen they shall be
[50:57] delivered you know we can read in judges
[50:59] chap 6 and verse 11 about Gideon and how
[51:03] you know he was hiding it was a time of
[51:05] trouble it was the midianites would come
[51:07] and steal their crops and they'd been in
[51:09] a big F you know they have nothing to
[51:10] live on because the midianites would
[51:12] come and and steal it all the time and
[51:15] and here he is hiding in a threshing
[51:17] floor and have you ever seen a threshing
[51:19] floor it's a place it's a low place and
[51:22] and and and so he was hiding in this
[51:23] place so he could he could try to thresh
[51:25] his wheat and where actually in the wine
[51:27] press and there he is he's doing all of
[51:29] this hiding from the minites and all of
[51:31] a sudden he sees somebody standing
[51:33] before him and he and he looks at this
[51:36] and he's wondering is he real or is he
[51:38] an angel and and and the Lord said and
[51:41] and the Lord began to speak to him an
[51:43] angel appeared and the Lord said go in
[51:45] the in thy might and thou shalt save
[51:47] Israel from the hand of midianites have
[51:49] I not sent thee and he said him oh Lord
[51:51] wherewith shall I save Israel behold my
[51:54] family is poor in Manasses and I am the
[51:56] least in my father's house so he throwed
[51:58] up all of his excuses amen and the Lord
[52:01] said surely I will be with thee amen and
[52:05] thou shalt Smite the midianites as one
[52:08] man and now he's now looking okay Lord
[52:10] if this is really you you know he he had
[52:12] to have a fleece and so he goes gather
[52:14] some flesh and some unleavened cakes and
[52:16] and he brings them and presents them
[52:18] before him and the angel says put them
[52:20] there and he puts them in a place and
[52:22] the angel touched them with amen touched
[52:24] them with his with the fire of God and
[52:26] it burned it all up and then Gideon said
[52:28] perceive he was an angel and he's still
[52:31] standing there oh Lord God for because
[52:33] I've seen the angel face to face and the
[52:36] Lord said unto him peace be unto thee
[52:39] fear not Thou shalt not die all right on
[52:43] on my God in the middle of struggles in
[52:47] the middle of trouble do you not know
[52:49] that's exactly what John 14 said amen
[52:52] don't let your heart be troubled you're
[52:55] not going to die
[52:57] but I'm going to prepare a place for you
[53:00] that where I am there you may be
[53:03] also amen and Gideon built an altar
[53:06] there in unto the Lord and called it
[53:09] Jehovah Shalom until this day amen why
[53:13] why because in the middle of his
[53:14] struggle in the middle of his trial in
[53:17] the middle of he could just trust God
[53:19] God would give him peace and he took
[53:22] this peace with him and when he didn't
[53:24] have a great Army when he didn't have
[53:26] many men and he didn't have great
[53:28] armymen he held the battle and he
[53:31] destroyed the midianites why because he
[53:34] trusted in his
[53:38] God
[53:40] Amen God has given you his peace he paid
[53:45] a terrible price so you could have his
[53:47] peace yes he the Bible says he the
[53:50] chastisement of our peace were upon him
[53:53] let's look at that Isaiah 53 and verse
[53:55] one who hath believed our report and to
[54:00] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[54:03] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[54:05] plant and a root out of dry ground he
[54:08] hath no form nor comeliness and when we
[54:11] shall see him there is no beauty that we
[54:14] would desire him he is despised and
[54:17] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows
[54:19] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[54:21] were our faces from him he was despised
[54:25] and we esteemed him not surely he has
[54:27] borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
[54:30] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[54:33] of God and Afflicted but he was wounded
[54:36] for our
[54:37] transgressions he was bruised for our
[54:39] iniquities that the chastisement of our
[54:42] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[54:46] we are
[54:48] healed what happened there on that day
[54:50] was a very peculiar thing to the
[54:52] onlookers it might appear that he was
[54:55] suffering on his own behalf come on come
[54:57] on because of his own sins yet we
[55:00] esteemed him stricken smitten of God and
[55:04] Afflicted however the opposite was true
[55:08] the butt that's there butt that begins
[55:12] verse five but he was wounded for our
[55:16] transgressions he was bruised but he was
[55:19] bruised for our iniquities amen what is
[55:22] it he was bruised the innocent one
[55:24] suffered for the guilty one amen the
[55:27] righteous one suffered for the
[55:30] unrighteous the transgression were ours
[55:34] the Mortal wounds belong to us but he
[55:37] was pierced
[55:40] instead Hallelujah ours were the
[55:43] iniquities and so was the crushing and
[55:45] the def figuring bruises but he took
[55:48] them upon
[55:51] himself the stripes that fell on his
[55:53] back should have rightly been yours
[55:56] should have rightly been mine but he let
[55:59] them be on his so you could be
[56:02] healed that's right in a word he took
[56:06] what belonged to us and gave us what
[56:09] belonged to
[56:12] him oh God maybe I got to read that one
[56:15] more time he took what belonged to you
[56:19] he took your iniquities he took your
[56:22] transgressions and he took it and gave
[56:25] you back what belongs to him his
[56:29] peace
[56:31] Hallelujah in other words the world's
[56:33] idea of Justice was turned upside
[56:37] down and it was done so that the world
[56:40] could be put
[56:42] upright amen God I just about had a fit
[56:44] reading this consider now how
[56:46] chastisement had become peace the Hebrew
[56:49] word for chastises M musar it may be
[56:53] Corporal or verbal it may it may be an
[56:56] instruction or a discipline or rebuke or
[56:58] a punishment a chastisement by words
[57:02] indicate that the purpose is to instruct
[57:04] but what Isaiah spoke speaks of a
[57:07] chastisement is a chastisement of wounds
[57:10] it's a chastisement of bruises and
[57:12] stripes and the purpose is for peace
[57:16] amen amen the Hebrew word for peace is
[57:19] shalom it's much more than the absence
[57:21] of conflict or or the ceasing of
[57:24] hostilities It's A Hess oh yeah it's
[57:27] what was once missing is now
[57:30] restored it's what was once broken is
[57:33] now
[57:34] healed he done all this so when you get
[57:37] sick you can be at peace that his word
[57:40] said you can be healed he done this so
[57:43] when you were founded guilty in sin you
[57:46] can have peace cuz he took it all and he
[57:48] gave you what was his
[57:51] hallu Jesus the son of God became flesh
[57:55] he had Had No Lack nothing was missing
[57:58] nothing was broken the lack was
[58:03] ours a bro we had broken relationship
[58:06] with God from the fall the creation was
[58:08] broken we had broken with each other
[58:11] broken with our ownselves amen the
[58:14] chastisement should have been on us but
[58:17] it let it it it let it he let it come
[58:19] upon him so we could have his peace his
[58:23] Shalom his Hess
[58:28] Hallelujah he took your Brokenness so he
[58:31] can you can have his wholeness Lord he
[58:34] took your discouragement so you can have
[58:36] his peace he took your fears and worries
[58:39] so you can have his
[58:47] faith he did all of this so you could be
[58:49] at
[58:50] peace that you would go through a trial
[58:53] and be at peace that's a paradox
[58:56] that you can go through sickness and be
[58:58] at peace that's right that you can go
[59:01] through a hardship of financial hardship
[59:03] and be at peace why can I be at peace in
[59:06] a hard a financial hardship because he
[59:08] said he's Jehovah
[59:09] Gyra he's more than enough he's our
[59:12] provider amen why can I be at peace when
[59:15] I when I'm in the middle of a heart
[59:17] sickness why can I have that peace cuz
[59:20] he's Jehovah rapi he's a
[59:22] Healer he's a deliverer he's a comforter
[59:25] he's all of that that we have need
[59:31] of brother Brandon would preach from
[59:34] this scripture in Isaiah 60 arise Shine
[59:38] for thy light has come yes and the glory
[59:41] of the Lord is risen upon
[59:44] thee amen behold Darkness shall cover
[59:48] the Earth and gross Darkness the people
[59:50] but the Lord shall arise upon thee and
[59:53] His glory shall be seen upon thee so the
[59:56] the world is in darkness but upon the
[59:57] bride is light the glory of the Lord is
[1:00:01] shining upon thee his face is shining
[1:00:04] towards it he said this this is odd word
[1:00:06] to preach but Shalom it means peace it
[1:00:09] means God's peace God's peace he said it
[1:00:12] was a New Year's message he said he said
[1:00:14] it's not is it's it's to the church
[1:00:17] elected in Jesus Christ not just the
[1:00:19] church groups but the elect the lady the
[1:00:22] lady of the church Christ bride that's
[1:00:25] who I I'm
[1:00:27] addressing amen the two scriptures are
[1:00:29] are very contrast one to the other arise
[1:00:32] and shine for the glory is come upon you
[1:00:34] and the very next scripture is gross
[1:00:37] Darkness upon the people amen so we're
[1:00:40] we're a people living in with light upon
[1:00:43] us but living in
[1:00:46] darkness there's Darkness all around
[1:00:50] us so in the middle of Darkness I can
[1:00:53] have peace why because the light of God
[1:00:55] is the light unto my
[1:00:58] path we talk we preached on light
[1:01:01] sometimes ago and we talked about the
[1:01:03] the the light his word is a light unto
[1:01:05] our paths that's right and we spoke
[1:01:07] about it how that sometimes we don't the
[1:01:10] the light don't shine all the way to the
[1:01:12] end but it's enough light to see The
[1:01:14] Next
[1:01:16] Step you just walk as because it's a
[1:01:18] walk of faith if he shined a big old
[1:01:21] bright light all the way down to the end
[1:01:23] and said that's how it's going to be it
[1:01:25] wouldn't be f Faith No
[1:01:27] More but he wants you to walk by faith
[1:01:29] and not by sight so you're just taking
[1:01:32] one step at a time one moment at a time
[1:01:35] amen and you can do it while darkness is
[1:01:37] all around you and you may not be able
[1:01:39] to see three or four foot in front of
[1:01:41] you and it's so dark and gross darkness
[1:01:43] is upon the people and there's howling
[1:01:45] in darkness people chained in darkness
[1:01:47] and in the middle of it the Bride of
[1:01:49] Jesus Christ can be at
[1:01:52] peace why because the word has declared
[1:01:56] to be
[1:01:57] th
[1:02:00] Hallelujah arise and shine for the glory
[1:02:03] of God has come upon
[1:02:05] you the light is here grows Darkness
[1:02:08] upon the
[1:02:09] people so if you're walking by anything
[1:02:12] other than the light of God you're in
[1:02:16] darkness amen he said we're facing this
[1:02:19] year we're facing both Darkness and
[1:02:23] Light excuse me his old voice is Tred to
[1:02:27] hang bad for a while I'm tired of
[1:02:31] it the world is in one of the most
[1:02:34] chaotic times of Darkness it's ever
[1:02:37] stood in now this is
[1:02:44] 1964 somebody with some Mas skills tell
[1:02:46] me how many years that is that's 60
[1:02:52] years 60 years past past this stage the
[1:02:56] world is one in one of the most chaotic
[1:02:59] times of Darkness that has ever stood
[1:03:02] in and it goes into the darkness that is
[1:03:04] dealing with and it was dealing with men
[1:03:07] trying to be women and women trying to
[1:03:09] be men and and how they're dressing and
[1:03:11] how they're acting he said you can't
[1:03:13] hardly find a manly man no
[1:03:15] more on I was in' 64 God have mercy
[1:03:19] where are we at
[1:03:20] today matter of fact a manly man has
[1:03:23] looked down upon and sneered at and made
[1:03:26] fun
[1:03:27] of amen and a manly woman is lifted up
[1:03:31] out of her position and out of her place
[1:03:33] yes that's the darkness that we're
[1:03:38] in amen we we can't you know we can't
[1:03:41] get to the place when a when a minister
[1:03:43] begins to correct something that we get
[1:03:44] all out of sorts and out of order and we
[1:03:47] get all tore up about it don't let the
[1:03:49] political spirits come into your
[1:03:52] spirit amen we got political spirits
[1:03:54] that are moving in this world I think
[1:03:56] it's very ironic that right here they're
[1:03:58] defunding the
[1:04:01] police what what what what what was the
[1:04:04] police Amen equated to in the message
[1:04:06] the Holy
[1:04:09] Spirit come on somebody and they come
[1:04:11] down and they want to defund the police
[1:04:14] and take the control away and put it in
[1:04:16] the Lawless people and allow them to do
[1:04:19] whatever they want to don't you know
[1:04:22] those same spirits will try to R right
[1:04:24] into the church
[1:04:26] and when the man of God begins to preach
[1:04:28] against something you say well I can't
[1:04:29] believe that's a bunch of old nonsense
[1:04:31] no sir it's the Holy Spirit crying out
[1:04:34] against
[1:04:36] it let's don't defund the Holy Spirit
[1:04:40] let's allow him to be powerful and
[1:04:42] moving Among Us and allow him to change
[1:04:45] our lives and to minister us
[1:04:56] so we're facing this year both Darkness
[1:04:58] and Light the world is in one of the
[1:05:00] most chaotic times of Darkness so it's
[1:05:04] just like it was at the beginning when
[1:05:05] there was gross Darkness upon the earth
[1:05:07] and the spirit of God began to move upon
[1:05:10] the face of the water and a voice spoke
[1:05:12] and said let there be light and God
[1:05:14] separated the light from darkness and
[1:05:15] he's doing it again
[1:05:17] today amen I believe that we're now
[1:05:19] living in the hour when God is
[1:05:21] separating light from Darkness he is
[1:05:24] pressing it to the the other side of the
[1:05:26] world and light that the light might be
[1:05:28] made manifest he said that's the church
[1:05:31] to the then the church the reason I say
[1:05:33] shalom to them is because that's God's
[1:05:36] peace that's what I want to bring to you
[1:05:38] amen not looking back but looking
[1:05:41] forward to the breaking of a new day
[1:05:43] there's something great laying just
[1:05:45] ahead of us we're 60 years down the road
[1:05:48] how much closer are we to something
[1:05:51] great just ahead of
[1:05:54] us amen yeah it's the greatest tra of
[1:05:58] trouble it's the days that are perilous
[1:06:00] and men are lovers of pleasure more than
[1:06:02] lovers of God and they deny the power
[1:06:04] there all this we see it taking place
[1:06:06] but right in the middle of it there's a
[1:06:08] bride walking through Satan's e and
[1:06:11] she's at peace knowing God is in control
[1:06:14] that no matter what she goes through
[1:06:16] he's in
[1:06:17] control come on let me get on that just
[1:06:19] for a moment you might be in sickness
[1:06:21] but he's in control you might be in a
[1:06:24] trial but he's in control
[1:06:26] you might be don't know where your next
[1:06:28] feeli is coming from your next money to
[1:06:30] pay something but he is in
[1:06:38] control Hallelujah so it's
[1:06:41] shalom we see it breaking Over the
[1:06:46] Horizon he said there's something great
[1:06:48] laying the word the years has been the
[1:06:50] joy that we look forward to the pressing
[1:06:52] the coming of that great light talking
[1:06:54] about it the eternal
[1:06:59] and I want you to understand we're not
[1:07:00] trying to put just something out in
[1:07:02] front of us like a carrot but there is
[1:07:04] something out in front of us it's called
[1:07:06] a body
[1:07:08] change
[1:07:10] amen we see it breaking Over the Horizon
[1:07:13] we breaking between Mortal and
[1:07:14] immortality we see it breaking between
[1:07:17] heavens and earth from the Earthbound
[1:07:18] sickness and trouble world into the
[1:07:20] bright shining day of immortal life and
[1:07:23] the immortal body and Immortal Earth
[1:07:24] that'll never pass away it's shalom to
[1:07:27] the church it's lifetime coming for the
[1:07:31] Believers Hallelujah but gross Darkness
[1:07:34] for the people gross Darkness upon the
[1:07:37] people but now he and he like I said he
[1:07:40] went through a whole time of darkness
[1:07:42] and for the sake of time I'm not going
[1:07:43] to go through all that but he brought it
[1:07:45] he said now what he said I spend a lot
[1:07:46] of time on Darkness but what about the
[1:07:48] light he said there is a light so Rise
[1:07:51] and Shine for the light has come How can
[1:07:54] there be darkness in light has got to be
[1:08:00] separated and it's
[1:08:02] happening when the word is preached
[1:08:04] light and darkness is
[1:08:10] separated amen it's separated the only
[1:08:13] one only thing that separated is the
[1:08:15] word manifest it presses the darkness to
[1:08:18] the other side but when the manifested
[1:08:20] word of God the sun which is spoken into
[1:08:22] existence by the word shows itself
[1:08:24] Darkness runs to the other side that's
[1:08:27] what's taking place now darkness is
[1:08:29] separating itself from the light now to
[1:08:31] the elected Church in this dark hour he
[1:08:34] said now I say shalom God's peace
[1:08:39] peace
[1:08:41] peace every true Hebrew knew when he met
[1:08:44] when they meet one another they say
[1:08:46] shalom in other words good morning God
[1:08:48] be with you God's peace go with you it's
[1:08:51] good morning how do you do
[1:08:56] amen amen I'm going to say that to you
[1:08:59] tonight
[1:09:00] Shalom which is good morning how do you
[1:09:03] do why is it good morning it's the
[1:09:04] evening time because the word has
[1:09:07] brought the
[1:09:08] light and it's a light that is daing in
[1:09:11] on our hearts and our lives and it's
[1:09:13] pushing back the darkness so Shalom how
[1:09:16] do you
[1:09:20] do well brother Timothy I tell you what
[1:09:22] I've been so worried and all quit
[1:09:24] looking at the
[1:09:26] Darkness I've been so tore up about what
[1:09:28] I'm going through quit looking at the
[1:09:31] darkness maybe your vision with your
[1:09:33] eyes is all blurry and you can't see
[1:09:35] maybe we're almost where to take the
[1:09:37] next step quit looking and worrying
[1:09:39] about that just know when you step
[1:09:41] there'll be another word there for you
[1:09:43] to step on there'll never be another
[1:09:45] place that you can step and a light to
[1:09:47] illuminate it and allow you to move here
[1:09:49] and to move here and to move there why
[1:09:52] cuz God will not let his children be
[1:09:54] forsaken
[1:09:56] he's not going to allow it to come down
[1:09:58] into this time and where we're at and
[1:10:00] the Darkness is here and all the light
[1:10:02] to go out no when the light goes out
[1:10:04] that means we have
[1:10:10] left you're talking about
[1:10:17] Darkness this room looks bright because
[1:10:20] of all the
[1:10:21] lights started letting it go out one at
[1:10:23] a time yes that's what has happen
[1:10:25] happening right now actually why is
[1:10:27] getting
[1:10:29] darker cuz those our loved ones are
[1:10:32] going on over to the other side more
[1:10:35] lights moving over
[1:10:39] there but that light's not going to stay
[1:10:41] over there it's going to press back this
[1:10:44] way and it's going to push the darkness
[1:10:46] away until we can see them as they
[1:10:52] see W have that blurry vision no
[1:10:58] more we w't have those weird feelings no
[1:11:01] more we want to have all that eeky icky
[1:11:03] Darkness around us no more no we were
[1:11:06] was standing in complete
[1:11:13] light
[1:11:15] Shalom peace it's good morning to the
[1:11:18] church why you say that because Christ
[1:11:21] is appearing Among Us the Morning Light
[1:11:24] the Morning Star he's appearing among us
[1:11:26] when we see Darkness settling Darkness
[1:11:29] it gets darkest just before the day we
[1:11:31] know that the morning star is hanging
[1:11:33] Yonder to introduce the coming sun and
[1:11:35] when the morning shine star shines it's
[1:11:37] the goet it's always darkest just a few
[1:11:40] minutes before the day the black out
[1:11:43] comes and the moon fails to shine
[1:11:45] darkness before the day is because the
[1:11:47] light is pressing the
[1:11:52] darkness so don't think the darkness is
[1:11:54] getting great
[1:11:56] the light's getting stronger and it's
[1:11:59] pressing the darkness and The Morning
[1:12:01] Star comes out and says good

[1:14:14] where's he headed he's headed right back
[1:14:16] to the
[1:14:18] mud that wasn't true freedom but if you

[1:14:25] again that's true
[1:14:29] Freedom amen this is what we have

[1:18:28] something some character named Moon Moon
[1:18:30] something so never fear Moon Moon bird
[1:18:34] or moon beam is
[1:18:35] here that's what they their whole deal

[1:19:18] person that my eyes have come open to
[1:19:20] see this day and if he has allow my eyes
[1:19:24] to come open to where I can see the day
[1:19:27] that I'm living in and I can recognize
[1:19:29] him in his
[1:19:30] presence and then I can trust him for
[1:19:33] the future cuz I have seen him vindicate
[1:19:35] his word Time After Time After Time and
[1:19:39] he brought his word and he sent his word
[1:19:41] and he healed
[1:19:45] them so there will be a
[1:19:49] millennium the old will be young forever
[1:19:52] sickness will fade away death will will
[1:19:54] be no more we will build houses and that
[1:19:57] we will inhabit them we will plant
[1:19:59] Vineyards and eat the fruit
[1:20:03] thereof we'll not plant and another eat
[1:20:06] we're not build and another live in it
[1:20:08] but we'll build and live we'll plant and
[1:20:12] we'll eat nothing will be able to harm
[1:20:14] us we'll be changed from what we are now
[1:20:17] into the Glorious image of the Son of
[1:20:19] God years will never be able to touch
[1:20:22] you age can't do nothing to you you will
[1:20:25] be the
[1:20:27] immortal son or daughter of
[1:20:32] God what about the future he holds
[1:20:38] it how do I know when he's coming I
[1:20:41] don't know but he'll be
[1:20:43] there how do you know that brother
[1:20:45] Timothy cuz he said he
[1:20:47] would he said if it wasn't true I
[1:20:49] wouldn't tell you but he said it so it
[1:20:52] has to be
[1:20:53] true he's never let one other word fall
[1:20:55] to the ground so why would he start
[1:20:57] now well it's 2024 what difference did
[1:21:00] that make it was 120 years that Noah
[1:21:05] waited built an arc and hammered and
[1:21:08] then after he got it all finished he
[1:21:09] still had to
[1:21:11] wait God's time is not man's
[1:21:15] time we wanted a certain time a certain
[1:21:18] way certain place it's got to be this
[1:21:20] way and we get all in a tizzy and tore
[1:21:22] up about it if it don't happen the way
[1:21:23] we thought it should have You're Not
[1:21:25] Looking Through The Eyes of Christ
[1:21:26] you're looking with your eyes he knows
[1:21:28] the perfect times he knows the perfect
[1:21:31] way amen so we can have
[1:21:35] peace we can have peace in the middle of
[1:21:38] our storm listen he had it you know the
[1:21:40] PE kind of Peace he had there was a
[1:21:42] storm Rock in the boat what was he
[1:21:45] doing
[1:21:47] sleeping not
[1:21:53] us what's going to happen what's this
[1:21:56] thing's about to go down what we going
[1:21:58] to do Jesus
[1:22:02] peace he wasn't worried about the storms
[1:22:05] because the storms couldn't kill
[1:22:07] him why could they not kill him because
[1:22:10] it hadn't been prophesied to be so the
[1:22:12] word didn't say it would be that way the
[1:22:14] word said it'd be hung on a tree so he
[1:22:17] had enough confidence in his own word
[1:22:20] that he could sleep in the middle of a
[1:22:21] storm
[1:22:25] then why can't we have that same kind of
[1:22:26] confidence we go through things in life
[1:22:29] well I can't sleep at night well Psalms
[1:22:31] 4 and verse 8 said I will both lay me
[1:22:34] down in peace and
[1:22:37] sleep for thou Lord only maketh me dwell

[1:22:48] out door next to you that gives you
[1:22:51] safety that's your own your depending on
[1:22:54] your own abilities listen when some
