Of course, we want to continue to remember brother Ron Spencer and his fight with cancer or to just give him a complete victory in his life. Amen. Others that no doubt are fighting the same battles. Amen. I just believe he's a God who can touch any knee. No matter what, how how far it is, how deep it is, how hard it is, it doesn't matter. He's a God who answers. Amen. So let's just go to him in prayer today and just ask him to come by this way and speak to our hearts.

And even when this world is shaking and everything around it is shaking, Lord, we can have our feet upon a rock, Lord, and stand firm in the understanding that you're in control of every situation. Doesn't matter if it's sickness, doesn't matter if it's governments or situations around us. You're in control of every situation and you have the ultimate and final say. Lord, today we bring these knees before you. Our precious brother Ron, just remembering him today again as Lord, as he's in this battle, been in here about five years. And Lord, we've seen miracles. We've seen you do many mighty things, Lord. But God, we're just asking, Lord, that you would bring a complete healing in his body, Lord, for Sister Samantha sick today, Lord, and meet her need. We pray. And Lord, the hands were lifted all over this building. You know each heart. You know each life. Father God, we ask you to minister to each one. Lord, we just give this service to you everything to be said and done for your glory and for your honor. Lord, may the word just come, Lord, and minister to us and lift us up, Father. May it get our eyes off the world around us and get our eyes upon you. We pray. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. just have an announcement says in preparation for the upcoming workday on this coming Saturday. We'd like for you to remove any items that you have here in the church on the church pews and the nursery, the fellowship hall. We'd like to have these items moved so we can start to clean. And if they're not, I'll just add this. If they're not removed, they'll go in the main domain. Amen. Please don't store things in the nursery or other areas of the church. We need to remove those things today. Also, a reminder that we're having a a night of worship on this coming Tuesday night at 700 p.m. We're doing that because we're changing up some things here on the platform and just kind of want to have a casual time to get used to that and work through some changes.

Brother Timothy started a song, the service with the song of Bula Land. If you can just softly just play that for a moment. [Music] Most of you know and probably have heard by now that our precious brother Ed Bisll passed from this life this past Wednesday night. He was at the age of 90. He would have been 91 just a few weeks over about I think the 3rd of October. And as the news reached us Wednesday night, our hearts were stirred with with both sorrow and yet reverence. In fact, speaking with brother Ron Spencer, he told me, he said, "I wept all night." And I said, "Well, my emotions were I was just stunned to think about where we are at this time in the journey." [Music] But it was a great soldier of the cross, I believe, a general in the army of the Lord. He's now laid down his sword, crossed over to his reward. It was about 5:34 p.m. there on the West Coast that he passed from this body of humiliation to be clothed with his theophony. That's a heavenly tabernacle that's not made with hands. and he's now joined that great cloud of witnesses, the millions of believers who have gone on before. &gt;&gt; Brother Bisc was more than a preacher. He was a father. Yes. &gt;&gt; As Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 4:15, "Though you have may have 10,000 instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers, for in Christ Jesus, I have begotten you through the gospel." That was Brother Ed, a father in the faith. He was a spiritual patriarch to many of us. He mentored with grace. He strengthened with wisdom. He encouraged with unshakable vision. He hands in the hearts of the people. He never was interested in building his own kingdom. He didn't gather men to himself. He pointed them to Christ. He did his best to equip them and to re release them into the harvest. His zeal for the truth was unmatched. His passion was, if you know him, it was contagious [Music] and his legacy immeasurable. And words will fall short to describe the loss that I feel today. And as I will be at the memorial service Sunday and will speak there with brother Ron Spencer, I I feel it at lost to express the right words cuz truly a gap has opened in our ranks and we find ourself asking this question. Where are we in time? Where do we go from here? are. Maybe some will even ask who will rise to fill the space he has left. And I say truthfully, his shoes cannot be filled. But his voice, though now silent, can still echo through ours. We can carry his fire. We can carry his burden. We can follow the trail that he blazed. Paul says in the book of Hebrews, remember them that have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation. So in this he commanded us to reflect on the lives of those who led us in the word and to consider their conduct and to follow their faith. [Music] And when we consider brother Ed's in We don't find regret but reward. We don't find failure but faithfulness and fruitfulness. Not silence but a legacy that speaks. As Paul said in first Timothy, he fought a good fight. He finished his course. He kept the faith. And now there is laid up for him a crown. No, not one of gold but of righteousness made not by man but prepared by God. Psalms 116 it says, "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints." So this is not a loss. It was a homecoming. Psalms 37:37 says to mark the perfect man and behold the upright. For the end of that man is peace. His end is was not tragedy. It was peace. It was a life that was well lived. A faith that was wellkept. [Music] Revelation 14 says, "Blessed are they that die in the Lord that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them. His influence marches on. His words walk behind him like a procession of light. His life left a path that we too can follow." So I say go rest for a little while. Brother Biscll, join the fellowship of the saints. Paul, Wesley, Luther, Brother Brandham, and countless others who've longed for this day. But I say, don't rest too long. The trumpet will sound, the Lord shall descend, and you shall rise. Not in a theophony this time, but in a glorified body reunited with the living saints to finish the mystery and to fulfill the promise. And to that I say, even so, come Lord Jesus, come. [Music] Let's bow our heads. [Music] Father, as I stop today and pause, beginning with this moment of silence to remember a life that was well-lived, a testimony of Jesus Christ. Lord, we want to thank you for brother Biscll. Lord, I I can hardly believe that chapter is closed, that that era is finished. Lord, I can remember the mighty messages and sermons that he preached. I can remember his last that he preached here at Evening Light tabernacle and described how as he sat on a log and his whole life was exposed and there and that moment of time changed eternally. [Music] May you bless his family today. Sister Ruth who suffers such great loss. His daughters, his loving grandchildren, his son-in-laws, the extended family, the great grandchildren, all of them, you know them. Thank you, Father, for his life, his testimony. a large number, a great host are tributes to his ministry and serve the Lord and follow him. But if there be any that are outside of the ark of safety, I pray that your gracious arm will reach over to them and touch them during this time. Bless us. I pray today as we put on the armor and we step forward where one of our ranks has fallen and been taken home. May we press for the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus. Bless us today as we worship together in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Help me sing that. Build a land. And someday I'll stand there. My home shall be eternal. Buy you alive. Amen. God bless you. Thank you. We appreciate the Lord today and his goodness. As I look over at the congregation today, I want to especially welcome again our brother James Hollis back there again who's who's brave the the the the highways to come and be with us again today. And I'll tell you what, that encourages me to to preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. To put my heart all into it. People that make such an effort. We have brother Gary, sister Barbara Stany here. Been longing to be in service with us here again this morning. They also come from a long ways away and they uh are here to worship God with us and we so love and appreciate you both and thankful that you were able to come and be with us today. It makes it a very special time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm going to be going away, as you know, uh going to brother Kelly's to preach his his camp meeting. Brother Eron and Brother Timothy will go with us. Brother Ron has canceled going there. Instead, flying directly to Vancouver. I'll preach there Thursday night and Friday night. Saturday, we'll fly to Vancouver. And then then to we'll preach with Brother Ron in the memorial service and then we will fly back. I will fly back to to Saskatoon and continue there and be back the following Thursday. So, keep me in prayer. There's a lot on my plate and uh you know, a lot of responsibility that goes with it. You know, praying that we have the right words, the right messages for the convention for brother Kelly. We don't take that lightly. And um also that we'll have the right words to say for brother Biscll. and this morning that God will help me to hurry up. So, I want you to listen fast &gt;&gt; because we got a lot of ground to covered and I'm going to be speaking today on the eternal prescription. And of course we are we are talking about the mountains that we have to to move out of the way because we we are here you know preparing for the coming of the Lord and making the path smooth. Amen. And uh bringing down the the mountains of unbelief and lifting up the the um the valleys of neglected truths. And so mountains have to be moved, valleys have to be moved, the road has to be prepared &gt;&gt; for the coming of the Lord. And so we're going to start with the words of Jesus that there was um a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God. For no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him." And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of of God." And Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" And and Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, you must be born again. the when bloweth, where it list, and thou hears the sound thereof, but cannot tell when it cometh, and whether it goeth, and so is everyone that is born of the spirit. And of course, we know this would be where the wind would blow on in Acts chapter 2. And men and women for the first time would be born of the spirit of God, &gt;&gt; receiving the Holy Ghost. God bless you. Can be seated. Now, as we as we look at this for a moment and and um I just wanted to go back and remember that we spoke last week of the new birth lost now restored and how through the ages the truth of the new birth was was lost. And um so the complete truth of being justified, sanctified, filled with the spirit which is the token is was lost. And God gave a prescription on the day of Pentecost and men have watered it down &gt;&gt; and they have changed the formula until it no longer inoculates against sin. &gt;&gt; Now it may have enough of the formula to treat sin, but it doesn't cure it. &gt;&gt; And what was given on the day of Pentecost was intended for and it produced a sin cure. It completely cleans the soul and eradicated sin disease. Now when Jesus preached his first doctrine that we have read here, it is it was the new birth. It and he taught emphatically that it was to be born of the spirit. &gt;&gt; And of course, no one but Jesus had ever been born of the spirit. He was the first of the God race. He was the first born of ever creature and he was the first of the new creation. So he received the spirit at the river Jordan, but everyone else had to wait until redemption was secured. Now, I'm going to go over this for you because Jesus makes a wonderful statement in the last day, the great day of the feast, that he stood and cried and said, "If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink." And then he said, "He that believeth on me, those who truly believe on me, as the scripture has said, then here will be the proof of their faith, that their faith is complete, that out of his innermost being or out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water." And then he says, "But this spake he," now watch this is in parentheses because John now will will explain why he says this. He said, "But this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive bec for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified." So we we can see there that the spirit could not be given until redemption was complete. &gt;&gt; Now he says for the Holy Ghost was not yet given. And so uh again because Jesus was not yet glorified. Now these this is important or else the apostle John would not put this in here to explain even what Jesus was saying here. Now glorified it refers to Jesus death, burial, resurrection and ascension back to the father. The spirit could not indwell believers permanently until Jesus had died to atone sin. Amen. Risen to conquer death, hell, and the grave and justify us and then ascended to the father um to be our high priest and our intercessor. So the blood had to be shed. It had to be accepted in the heavenly tabernacle before the spirit could be poured out on the earth. And so the spirit comes as the life of the risen Christ. The Holy Ghost is the spirit of the glorified Christ. &gt;&gt; The very life that was in him now released to indwell the believer. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus said this um that he that he says I will pray the father and he will give you the comforter. Now, as we look at this, I want to go back there. The Holy Ghost was not yet given because the blood had to be shed and and he had to die and be and atone. But now notice here there this these scriptures, I will pray the father, he'll give you another comforter, even the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; So the spirit had not yet been given. Watch now. By the right hand of the father or the god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he has shed forth that which you now see and hear. So what happened on the day of pentecost is explained by Peter saying that he had received of the father the promise of the holy ghost and he has now shed this abroad. Now then again in John 16 Jesus loan word nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come to you but if I depart I will send him unto you. So the comforter the spirit could not be given as a comforter until Jesus was exalted to the throne. And at Pentecost as as Peter declared, you know, by the right hand of God exalted, having received the father from the father, the promise of the holy ghost, he has shed this forth. So now it is the spirit of God coming back in or the spirit of Christ or Christ himself coming back in spirit form. He could not indwell them until he had completed his work and been exalted &gt;&gt; right now. So now we notice this comes from a pattern in the Old Testament which is blood first and then spirit. &gt;&gt; In the tabernacle, blood was was sprinkled on the mercy seat before God's presence ever appeared. And then likewise Jesus had to present his blood before the throne in heaven and only then could the shikina glory the spirit fill the church as the new temple. Now Paul said that the spirit of God is a down payment. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the earnest of our inheritance and we could not receive the down payment until Christ had secured the full inheritance by his death and his resurrection. &gt;&gt; So now he says he says again I tell you the truth I it's expedient for me to go away. You see his glorification was necessary for the spirit to come. So he left physically so he can return spiritually not limited by a single human body but able to dwell in his church worldwide. &gt;&gt; And in this way the church would do greater works because now he would be alive in and living and working in a multimembered body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so you as we see here, we're going to think about this for a moment because many will say, "But brother Tim, you know, there are many in the Old Testament that were filled with the spirit." Even John the Baptist was filled with the spirit from his mother's womb. Now, I want to get this to you because John the Baptist filling was like all the prophets in the Old Testament. It was prophetic, not regenerative. All right. For the Bible said, "He will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb." Now, what was this? This was a special anointing for his prophetic mission. &gt;&gt; You see, it was it was um through throughout the Old Testament, you see the spirit of God came up on the people. You see, for service or for prophecy as the spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon found in Jud Judges, the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon Samson again in Judges. The spirit came came of the Lord came upon Saul in 1 Samuel. Now these experiences empowered people &gt;&gt; for God's work but did not constitute a new birth. &gt;&gt; You see, as that would not be given until Pentecost. Now, so as we look at this, before the cross, the spirit could visit, it could empower and it could feel temporarily or rest upon someone for a task. But after the cross, after the resurrection, the spirit indwells permanently as the new birth, Christ living in the believer. And and of course Ezekiel would prophesy this and he would say um he would say um about the new covenant coming, I will put my spirit in you and cause you to walk in my statutes. &gt;&gt; So we see it would be the spirit of God that would empower men and women to obey the word of God. Without the Holy Ghost empowering you, you cannot live the Christian life. So now as we look at this, I want to just point out John the Baptist prenatal filling was real, &gt;&gt; but it was pre-Calvary &gt;&gt; and therefore not a permanent indwelling of the spirit as given in the new covenant. It was a prophetic empowerment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as we as we look upon this, I want to get this what he said in Ezekiel because this within you. I will put my spirit within you. Not upon you, &gt;&gt; but within you. This is the new covenant as prophesied. And it it would be the spirit changing the nature and now permanently in dwelling. &gt;&gt; Now, but that awaited Jesus glorification. You see, even the disciples walked with Jesus and performed miracles, but did not receive the undwelling spirit until Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so if we even look at Christ, the Lord Jesus as our pattern, we we find that Jesus though he was conceived of the Holy Ghost, he did not minister publicly until the spirit descending on him at his baptism. and and anointed him for service and then indwelled him. &gt;&gt; Right? So, as we said, John the Baptist was filled with the spirit in his mother's womb as a as a special uh specific prophetic empowerment that prepared him to be the forerunner of Jesus Christ. But the new birth by the indwelling of the spirit, the permanent life of Christ within could not come until anyone until Jesus blood was shed to atone for sin and and was glorified. And so after Calvary and Pentecost, the spirit coming became not just a visitation that would come and go and Moses would be anointed and then the anointing would leave and then Moses would would again, you know, would would fail the Lord because he would exalt himself and David would do the same. You know, all these things, you know, the anointing would come and go. But you you see at Pentecost it was not just a visitation &gt;&gt; but the incarnation &gt;&gt; of Christ in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So John was filled with the spirit for his mission. Um but he could not be born again as they were at Pentecost. Now the spirit could visit before Calvary but after Calvary the spirit could inhabit. So before the cross, the Holy Spirit clothed men for servant for service. And after the cross, the spirit indwells men for sunship. &gt;&gt; And there's a difference. &gt;&gt; You see, the spirit could not be poured out before Jesus was glorified because that spirit was the very life of the glorified Christ. &gt;&gt; Sin had to be dealt with. &gt;&gt; Death had to be conquered. Christ had to be enthroned before his life could be imparted to his people. And once glorified, he sent the Holy Spirit to come in and dwell his body, not to be just with them now, &gt;&gt; but in them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, so Calvary opened the fountain. The resurrection raised the power. Pentecost poured it out. And the Holy Ghost we receive today is the glorified Christ living in his people. Ain't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. So at Pentecost, the spirit of God descended. Let's read about it. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, there they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind. And it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance. Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their hearts and they said, "What shall we men and brethren? What shall we do?" This is what they asked Peter. And Peter says what? He gives the eternal prescription. He says, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Now, this promise will go how long? &gt;&gt; It'll be to you. &gt;&gt; It'll be to your children. &gt;&gt; It'll be for them that are far off. As long as the gospel goes to all the world. Amen. This will be the divine vaccine, the inoculation against sin. This will be the eternal prescription. This is what will be required to go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Will be this eternal prescription. &gt;&gt; No one can go without it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as we look at this here, I want just to think of this because this remained unchanged in brother Brandham's teaching. Brother Brandham emphatically taught that the Holy Ghost was an experience you receive. is not mere a mere confession of faith of I believe the message or I I receive its truth or I agree I concur with its doctrines or I have this revelation and to do this he will use Moses as an example. And he said Moses, you know, was called of God a prophet. And while he was called being a prophet, he had to have a supernatural experience in order to be a prophet. He had to meet God face to face and talk with him. And another thing, what he had said had to come to pass or no one would have believed him. So no man has a right to call himself thus until he's talked face to face with God on the backside of a desert somewhere where he met God himself. And all the atheists in the world could not explain it away from him. He was there. He knew it happened. Every Christian should have that experience before they say anything about being a Christian. Your own experience. So, Brother Brandham taught us over and over and over, he said, even in question answer 64, yeah, you, you know, you've got to have the lighting of the candle. &gt;&gt; The fire has to come and ignite. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he even talks to his nephew. Now, watch this because here you're talking to a relative here. Here you're talking to your kin folks. You think he's going to mislead his kin folks? So he says, "I'm talking to my nephew. A little while ago, a little Catholic boy said, "Uncle Bill, I've run from pillar to post, going everywhere, trying to find something night after night." And he says, "Before this meeting started, he's been crying every night time. He's been dreaming of dreams, coming in, running up the altar. We're preaching and making confession that he's been wrong." And I said, Melvin, no matter where you try to go, how many churches you join, how many hail Marys you say, cuz he's a Catholic boy, how many blessings you get from men, you see, you've got to be born again of the spirit of God. It's the only thing that has satisfy the human heart. Now then he says, "Now I know they got a substitute today for being born again." &gt;&gt; Remember we went through the substitute last week, a substitute like in the Old Testament, a substitute lamb till the real lamb came. &gt;&gt; You see uh a substitute atonement for sin that would not take away sin but would only cover it till the redeemer came. So again, a substitute. What we got down to the dark ages was a substitute for new birth. What we got even with with that justification and sanctification was also substitute. Even a soua street was a substitute. It was the anointing of the spirit coming down. And and the token only came back at evening time. So that's how I know they got a substitute today of being born again. Just shake hands with the preacher, put your name on the book. But friends, that's a dogma. &gt;&gt; It's not a Bible truth. It would the Acts of the Apostle in the second chapter would read like this. When the day of Pentecost was fully come, the pastor walked out and shook hands with the people. But it said when the day of Pentecost was fully come at the inauguration of the church, there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting. That's how the Holy Spirit come the first time. That's how it come every time since that time. He's God and he changes not. Now it stumbles people and they say that was for another day. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandon said he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Every time the church ever received the Holy Ghost, it's always come like he did the first time under the same prescription. Acts 2:38 has never changed. Never will change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Never will change. Watch now. Then he says it's like a doctor's prescription for disease. He'll write out a prescription for the disease the doctor does and it has to have as and take it as something quite drugous and he puts too much of the antidote in it. It it's it's too weak and it won't do you any good and if he puts too much of the poison it'll kill you. It's got to be wrote just according to the doctor. And the doctor's prescription on how to receive the Holy Ghost is given by Dr. Simon Peter on the day of Pentecost. I'll give you a prescription. Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the prescription is to them that is far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call the eternal prescription. &gt;&gt; Now, this of course is what the prophet laid down for us. And and he says as he preaches the church aces and here he's standing there now as the messenger to Leodysia. And he's and he's revealing now all of the ages and their messengers and their message. And he stands there as that messenger. He says, "Oh God, cleanse my hands. Cleanse my heart. Lord, if it takes every friend I got, let me give the prescription the way the doctor said." &gt;&gt; That's the reason you've got so many dead churches and so many dead members. You're adding antidote and taking away so much of it until the prescription it ain't itself at all it won't heal nothing. &gt;&gt; Now church this is a problem. &gt;&gt; You know people are well we got the Holy Ghost but it didn't heal me of porn. It didn't heal me adultery. It didn't heal me of fornication. It didn't heal me of drugs. I I still you know have this habit. I I still You see, it don't heal nothing. &gt;&gt; You see why? Because there's not enough in it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to deal with this because you may have confession and you may even have faith in it and you may you may even got water baptized, but unless you get the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; there is not enough in it. Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, he says shaking hands, joining churches, sprinkling. Oh, mercy. That's not the prescription. That's death. If you want life and you want the Holy Ghost, follow what God said do. Take the prescription. &gt;&gt; That's exactly the way he said do. Don't add to it. Don't take away from it. Then over here you come over in revelation right here over said whoever will take away or add to the same will be taken his part out of the book of life. Amen. Now brother Brandham preaches a sermon over and over again just for your information. Four times he preaches the bomb in Gilead asking from Jeremiah is there no bomb? Is there no healing in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Are there those not preaching the word? Well, then why is it that the health of the daughter of my people recovered? So he preaches four times on Bal and Gilead. Eight times he preaches from the same scriptures entitles it. Why? And he's continues stressing this even after the seals he will preach on it. Now I listen church. Today we have a new breed of ministers and they are the rickies that follow every movement. fallen angels &gt;&gt; who get into it who who absolutely will bring in nickelanism as we brought it down to conquer the ley to make it where you don't receive the spirit &gt;&gt; and and this new breed of ministers are preaching about the Holy Ghost and sexuality saying that the Acts two experience is not valid today and that it won't remedy the the sex problem among our youth. You know, they're they're stressing the use of psychology and lessons to solve the problem of of sinful sexual vice, but and they boldly will even put on their brochures for the youth meetings that the Holy Ghost will not fix the problem that our young people are facing. Now, &gt;&gt; I'm not making that up, &gt;&gt; but I want to say we've got a bomb in Gilead. And we got physicians &gt;&gt; who still preach the word, &gt;&gt; but people refuse to take it. &gt;&gt; And God's asking why didn't you? And at the day of judgment, he's going to be asking why. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we have a whole bunch that look at their pastors over in the tribulation and said, "Why didn't you?" How come you tempered with the prescriptions? &gt;&gt; Look at where we are now. &gt;&gt; And God asked, "Why? I provided the bomb. &gt;&gt; I sent a message. &gt;&gt; I sent the token. &gt;&gt; It is here. Why didn't you take it?" &gt;&gt; Now, so brother Brandham even this and let me just read some excerpts from it. He said, "We got a bomb in Gilead. We got physicians, but the people is refusing to take it." And God's going to ask you, "Why? Why didn't you at the day of judgment? Is there no bomb in Gilead?" Sure. Is there no physicians there? Certainly. That's right. Then why is my people so sickish? Hallelujah. You know what's the matter? You get a real doctor to write out a prescription. You take it down to some quack drugist. and he goes to mention that prescription with something else. He will kill the patient. &gt;&gt; I just want to say the prophet of God wrote out the prescription just like Peter did. Amen. &gt;&gt; But then you get it in the hands of these drugist &gt;&gt; and they'll mix this and that and the other and psychology and &gt;&gt; formulas of men and nine steps to to overcoming and all kinds of junk &gt;&gt; and preservatives that kill. Now, you know, I don't know if I put any of them. No, so let me just keep it on that. So, it has to be, as I say, brother Brandham said, it has to be a balanced prescription. &gt;&gt; And God, the doctor noted how to give it to Simon Peter and he wrote and he said, "This prescription is for you, your children, to them that are far off." He says again, when a doctor finds a remedy for a disease and he writes a prescription and some quack drugist gets a hold and goes to adding a little of this and taking a little of this out, he'll either kill the patient or do something to it. The prescription doesn't even have enough medicine in it to do it any good. And if it don't, it's so weak, you won't help the patient. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's what's the matter with a lot of these seminary drugs today. They take the prescription out and add something else in and you got a bunch of dying morgs. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just tell you because you know it's all out. It's everywhere. I hear preaching. I hear preaching now that the Jews received the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost and it came with power and demonstrations. But for the Gentiles, it came upon the household of Cornelius and and they received the Holy Ghost. It came differently to the Gentiles. We don't receive it like that. They just received it by receiving the word. I wish people would read their Bible &gt;&gt; because the Bible did say that while Peter spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. But then it goes on to say how it was poured out. And and in Acts 10:46 said, "For we know they got the Holy Ghost like we did, &gt;&gt; for we heard them speak with tongues and magnify God." &gt;&gt; So they didn't just get it and not know it. They didn't just get it by receiving a doctrine. &gt;&gt; There was an experience &gt;&gt; that came with it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, we're not preaching a certain experience of a jump or a shout or dance or or speaking in tongues or gift or what. I don't care what form it comes in, &gt;&gt; just as long as it happens. And we will know whether or not it happened by the effect &gt;&gt; because after taking the vaccine, if you're still doing sin, &gt;&gt; we know you didn't take the prescription, right? So now, brother Brandham in the message, why this is one of the last ones he preaches. It's it's after the seals. This prescription still remains the same. &gt;&gt; When the Samaritans received it, they get inoculated. They had the same thing. When the Gentiles received it, they got the same prescription. So, let me tell you, no matter what they're teaching, the same prescription applies for Jews and Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Paul met a bunch in Acts 19 who had part, somebody say part, &gt;&gt; part of the prescription, not all of it. &gt;&gt; And he said that won't work. You're going to kill the whole thing. So, he wrote it all over for them, told them how to get it. They got it the same way. And that's what's the matter today. There's plenty of bomb in Gilead and we got plenty of positions, but the people are afraid of the prescription. Glory. Praise be to God. Is there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no power of the Holy Ghost? Now, now is there this inoculation works on all? See, it did on the Jews. It did on the Samaritans. It did on the Gentiles. It does on everybody the same way. &gt;&gt; That's right. You know, it's not a temporary prescription. &gt;&gt; It's an eternal prescription. It doesn't work for Acts two. And we got something else today. It's an eternal prescription. &gt;&gt; Now again, see this inoculation works. Brother Brandaman paradox. And this is a little quotation I want you to get. The pillar of fire is identified scientifically and by the reaction by its character in everything. How many believes this age has been visited by the pillar of fire again? &gt;&gt; And as it was when it was dwelling in the body of God's only begotten son, so does it dwell in the body of his adopted sons &gt;&gt; for the last day. That's right. &gt;&gt; So what you are seeing in Acts two of the Holy Ghost descending the pillar of fire and dividing itself, every one of you can have it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what you have. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm going to look back at the Reformation and and review how the new birth was restored in stages. Because in the early reformation, the new birth was not in its fullness as it was as Pentecost. But yet with each portion of truth that was revealed came a portion of the spirit. &gt;&gt; And the portion of the word given came with a portion of the spirit in every age. So the new birth corresponds to the revealed word in each age. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Those who received the new birth in Luther's age received the Holy Ghost that justified them. &gt;&gt; They accepted, they obeyed, they aligned with the word and it was re as it was revealed for that particular time. And the spirit is the word and whatever manifestation of the word comes in your age that is Jesus to your age. That's right. &gt;&gt; So you don't, well, I'm going to leave the message and find Jesus. No, the message. Only through the message can you find Jesus. &gt;&gt; You might find where he was and the fragrance of where he was in a past revival, but he's not there. &gt;&gt; Now, as we go into this, let's just go back to medieval Catholic understanding. You know, originally everybody knew the new birth, the Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost. This is what you had to do. But before Luther in the middle ages, the Roman Catholic Church taught the new birth was essentially tied to sacraments. So baptism, they believed infant baptism washed away the original sin and regenerated the child and that was considered the moment of the new birth. So if you were born in a Catholic family, you were taken and Christian or Christ put in you by the Holy Ghost, you know, there by baptism and you were regenerated when the water was sprinkled on you. And then and then uh of course penance and confession. If one sinned after baptism, penance, confession, acts of contrition, prayers, rosaries, pilgrimages, indulgences, that was a way to restore grace. And then finally you know they would have the eukarist which is mass which is receiving communion which was believed to impart Christ's life continually. So you go to mass every day because you need Jesus every day needed to be supply of him. So the new birth is viewed was viewed as church administered grace imparted by ritual maintained through sacraments not as a personal faith-based experience of Christ. So you could not receive it now and this is of course why the Catholics go to mass every day is because it is here the life of Christ is administered by the priest daily. So you see this was conquering the ley you had to get it from the priest &gt;&gt; from the clergy. Now contact with the church and the priest was needed and for them it's a daily renewal. So here they go to get renewed every day by going to mass. Stick out your tongue get the way for the the the priest gets the wine and and until he becomes a drunken s &gt;&gt; he staggers out drunk &gt;&gt; because he got too much of the spirit. Now, why and how? Because they believe the priest can change the bread into the literal body and blood of the Lord. Somebody reminded me, but I read the the book of Charles Quinn Chinnquy on uh 50 years in the church of Rome. How many's read it? Well, that's a good number. It's a it's a great read. Read it. But anyway, Charles Chenquay, he he he reported of how that they had a blind priest one day that was doing the sacrament. And you know, as they were as he was praying over and changed the bread into the literal body and him being blind, a rat came in and stole the body. And so they went to looking for it and discovered a rat had stolen the body of Jesus Christ. And this poor priest leaned over and wept bitterly saying, "Oh God, what will I do? The rats have eaten the precious body of my Lord." Now you say, "Brother Tim, that's ridiculous." Well, it is. You cannot change bread into the literal body of Christ. It is symbolic representing. &gt;&gt; And that's not how you receive Christ. You receive Christ by a new birth by the indwelling of the spirit. &gt;&gt; So the new birth and receiving Christ was now just a church administered grace. And then of course there was the emphasis on works because of this sacramental view. Salvation was thought of as a lifelong process of earning and keeping grace. Somehow we got to do something to merit sunship. &gt;&gt; That's what they thought. &gt;&gt; You were born again as an infant in baptism. You maintained it by obedience to the church, uh, penance, prayers, and indulgence in good works. Assurance of salvation was considered presumptuous. Nobody could be certain they were saved. &gt;&gt; So even after all of this, &gt;&gt; you couldn't be sure of salvation. So thus the new birth was not a conscious spirit rock transformation but a status conferred by the church. Hence while you after you died just in case you were sinned and which you did because you're all sinners and you can never overcome. So therefore you know you appear before God as a sinner. So you're in purgatory, a place of waiting until enough prayers are prayed and money is given by your loved ones to pray you out of purgatory so you can finally find rest for your soul. Until then, you are a tormented being. So for all of you that lost loved ones, divy up. And now my prayers, if your prayers wouldn't save me before I died, how are they going to save me after I'm dead? &gt;&gt; So you you see again th this was a condition. This no wonder we call this the dark ages. &gt;&gt; People believe this &gt;&gt; sincerely. Now, so before Luther, the the birth was sacramental regeneration, especially infant baptism and salvation was not an experience, but a process of works, penance, obedience to the church. Assurance was impossible. In fact, they considered it arrogance. You're really arrogant to think you're saved now. Nobody's saved now. So you see by the time of Luther and the Reformation, Luther knew that although he was born to church and he'd done penance and said rosaries and burnt candles and he was still unconverted, unchanged. And he hungered for a relationship with the living God. Not as a rel religious ritual. He had that not something coming from a ritual from an unholy priesthood who was sinful living double lives and every kind of other thing but by the time of Luther the truth of the new birth the spirit's undwelling it had to be administered by a priest now this is where brother Brandham talks about the doctrine of the nickelans &gt;&gt; you could not have the experience of acts two nobody could have a personal experience it had been reduced to rituals and sacraments now let's hurry Martin Luther's early life and religion he was born in 1483 inbin Germany he grew up in a strict Catholic household his father wanted to be a lawyer and in 1505 during a thunderstorm he vowed to St. an help me and I'll become a monk. He kept that vow and he entered an Augustine monastery. Now he's doing what he can to work his way to heaven to find salvation. And he pursued salvation by the only path that he knew works. He fasted long hours. He prayed long hours. He confessed constantly. He said the rosaries. He did penance. Listen, they them people are so sincere. They'll they'll crawl on their hands and knees until they're bloody, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Nail themselves to a cross doing penance, all kinds of things, physically whipping himself. And yet he later admitted though I lived as a monk without reproach. I felt that I was a sinner before God and I had an extremely disturbed conscience. I could not believe that he was placated by my sat satisfaction and he realized that all his religion left him unconverted and without peace. So this was Luther and he and until he comes to the tower experience and we'll talk about that in a moment. But until then he lives up under the torment of a guilty conscience. He feared the righteousness of God as an avenging justice. God's out to get me. He wants to kill me. A holy judge ready to con condemn me for the least thing I do wrong. And he said, "I did not love." Yes, I hated the righteous God who punishes sinners because I can't do right. I can't satisfy your justice. &gt;&gt; And all you want to do is punish me and cast me into hell. And nothing I can do, all the works I've done doesn't make me right before God. And though he had been born into the church and baptized and was zealous, he had no assurance of forgiveness. You know, Romans 1:17, it tormented him. The just shall live by faith. You know, the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith is written that just shall live by faith. And this scripture tormented him. So sometimes around 1519 while he was studying in the monastery in Wittenberg light finally broke through and Luther later wrote at last by the mercy of God meditating day and night I gave heed to the context of the word the just shall live by faith and then I began to understand the righteousness of God is that which is the righteous li lives by a gift of God namely by faith. And this is the meaning the righteousness of God is revealed by the gospel. Namely the passive righteousness which which merciful God justifies us by faith. And here I felt I was altogether born again. And it entered paradise itself through the open gate. And this was Luther's conversion. He discovered that justification is not earned. &gt;&gt; Righteousness is not something you do. It's it's imputed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Received by faith in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now this was Luther's conversion. And he believed now based on this experience that he was born again. Now born again, I want you to catch this takes on a new term. It no longer is works related and rituals related to the church, but it's when you believe &gt;&gt; that you are born again. &gt;&gt; So I want you to get it here. Now comes a new term. Justification becomes the new term or the new meaning of new birth. Now originally it meant receive the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; as on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Then it became reduced down in the dark ages in the medieval understanding to something imparted by the church. And then Luther comes along and gets a revelation that it's it's righteousness imputed to you by God through faith. And so the just, the righteous shall live by faith. So here he here again, the new birth takes on a new meaning. &gt;&gt; Now it's not the meaning that they had on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; But it's an improvement over Rome. &gt;&gt; It's a step closer to the truth. &gt;&gt; And fact of the matter is it is part It is part of the formula &gt;&gt; but not all. &gt;&gt; Now, so here was the scriptural foundation. The just shall live by faith. Romans 3:28 says, "Therefore, we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law." So he said, "Without all these works, I'm justified. I don't have to do anything to do it. My faith justifies me by believing what Jesus did for me." Ephesians 2:8-9, for by grace you are saved through faith that not yourself. It's a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. So it isn't how many rosaries I said, how much I climbed on my knees, how many times I whipped myself, it's grace. Now these verses became the foundation cry of the reformation and it became the the the the very crux of of Luther's preaching and just as the birth is water, blood and spirit and it takes three to make a new birth even so justification believing on the Lord believing on his word believe in the gospel message is the First step &gt;&gt; to the new birth. &gt;&gt; You must believe. &gt;&gt; He that cometh to God must believe. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So faith is the first step of the new birth. &gt;&gt; Now as he said without faith is impossible to please God. He that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he'll reward those that diligently seek him. This was the truth. I want to say that this was the truth, &gt;&gt; but it was partial truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, go back to Moses Lamb. It was the truth &gt;&gt; and the way of salvation for that time, &gt;&gt; but it was a partial word. that would give way to the fullness of the word. It would be a lamb, but it wouldn't be a woolly lamb. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be an animal. It would be God himself. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So, this now is something that will work until the new the fullness comes. But it's not all been restored yet. And we need it restored completely for rapture. &gt;&gt; So, this was the truth. So among early believers from Pentecost onward, everybody, everyone understood that the Holy Ghost came subsequent after believing that faith was the first works. You must believe and you must repent. You must be cleansed. But after that, you must receive the Holy Ghost. It was an option. It was a requirement for salvation. And this is where I want to say this. This is where millions of Christians, even some in the message are stuck in the mud &gt;&gt; and remain today. They believe and confess and yet go no further and many times not even the sanctification &gt;&gt; and faith is only the beginnings of salvation. &gt;&gt; Now I want to just drive this home here. I'm going to talk about it. And let's just go to a scripture that is the favorite among most of the reformers &gt;&gt; and and the evangelical churches. And it is a wonderful scripture. &gt;&gt; When I say it's their favorite, it ought to be ours, too. &gt;&gt; That if the thou confess with thy mouth, thy mouth, the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with a heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. So let's get it clear. Faith is the beginnings of salvation. &gt;&gt; It is the doorway. Every birth begins with a conception. &gt;&gt; Until you're conceived, you can't be born. &gt;&gt; So it begins with a conception. And when you believe from the heart and you confess Christ has risen from the dead and you receive him as your savior, you have taken a necessary step that is needed. &gt;&gt; If you hadn't done that, by all means do it. &gt;&gt; But that's not all of it. &gt;&gt; And John Wesley had this ex had this experience of the what was called the new birth. And and he knew there was more. He he realized, listen, it's got to be more than this. And confessing there's got to be your life and habits has got to be cleansed by the blood &gt;&gt; and then filled with the spirit. And and of course, there's millions that make the mistake of stopping just being cleansed. &gt;&gt; Now, Romans 10 shows the starting point. I'm going to drive this home, &gt;&gt; which is faith and confession. As Paul said, if you confess with thy mouth, believe from your heart. So faith in Christ, resurrection and confessing him as Lord, that is essential. &gt;&gt; Amen. But conception is the beginning &gt;&gt; of the new birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the seed of salvation planted in the heart. It is a conception of new life, not its full maturity. &gt;&gt; Believe in the heart righteousness in the inward turning to God. Confession with the mouth and salvation. Outward acknowledgment of of Christ. And and of course in that you'll get baptized and and immersed in the name of Jesus. You know, whosoever therefore shall confess me before man, him will I confess for my father which is in heaven. So you can see right there that that this is important. Now Peter at Pentecost shows the next step and and of course you know here he shows um this very very clearly and I'm going to just go back here just for a moment um that he shows very clearly of repentance, baptism and and the Holy Ghost coming. And when the people at Pentecost asked, "What shall we do? What did Peter say? Well, just believe the message is right. &gt;&gt; Just believe Jesus Christ is the son of God. Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; No. He said repent, &gt;&gt; be baptized &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, so this is what he said. He didn't say confess Christ. He gave the full covenant pattern, the full prescription. &gt;&gt; Now, so repentance is turning from sin. Baptism as identification with Christ's death, his burial, his resurrection, receiving the Holy Ghost is the new belief, the new birth completed where you are sealed to the day of redemption. Now, this is the same order that Jesus spoke of when he said, "Be born of the water and the spirit." Because it takes the cleansing first before you can be born of the spirit. Now, Paul shows this pattern elsewhere, and that's where I was going to here. He would show he, you know, th this was not his only teaching on the new birth. So, he teaches repentance in Acts 20:21. I both declared to both the Greeks, Jews and the Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance. So repent. &gt;&gt; Then he taught baptism. Romans 6 and three. Oh, don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death. We therefore buried with him in baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead to the glory of the father, we too may receive a new life. So baptism. Then he taught receiving the spirit. He said you are not in the realm of the flesh but in the realm of the spirit. If if indeed the spirit of God lives in you. If anyone does not have the spirit of &gt;&gt; Christ. You reading with me? &gt;&gt; They do not belong to Christ. But if Christ is in you, even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the spirit gives life because of righteousness. And if the spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his spirit that lives in you. &gt;&gt; So Paul taught repentance, baptism, and receiving the spirit. &gt;&gt; He did not just teach confess with your mouth. So, you got to get all of what Paul taught. Now, he's not contradicting Peter because he makes that clear. You know, I I I and all of this, he's not saying, "Okay, Peter, I'm going I'm going to rewrite the prescription for you here." You know, you said it was repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and for remission of sins, and you shall receive to get the Holy Ghost. I'm going to say just confess with your mouth, believe from your heart, and you got it. He didn't rewrite the prescription. &gt;&gt; Read his writings. &gt;&gt; Now again as we look salvation your conception is not the new birth. It's the starting point. &gt;&gt; Now brother Brandham actually teaches this in question answer 64 if you want to read it thoroughly. And and so you see confession the Bible said is made under salvation meaning toward resulting in not already possessing. &gt;&gt; This shows believing and confessing it points you toward salvation's reality but it doesn't complete it. It's it's the difference between the conception and the birth. Faith and confession plants the seed. Obedience to the word and receiving the spirit brings the new life to full manifestation. That that's why brother Brandham said full obedience to the word entitles you to the token. &gt;&gt; Well, what's he talking about, brother Jim? I got to be careful. Make sure I did everything right and crossed all the tees and and and dotted every eye and I I'm living perfectly and I I'm entitled. No. If you will be fully obedient to the word, &gt;&gt; if you'll repent, &gt;&gt; sincerely, &gt;&gt; come with confession, washed by the water of the word, &gt;&gt; cleansed by the blood. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody help me preach. Sanctified by the spirit, sir. &gt;&gt; If you will do this, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, so baptism confesses the resurrection in action. It's in your life. Now, Paul teaches that baptism is a confession of Christ's resurrection, dying to the old self, buried with him, raised with him. And this, of course, is faith in motion. Is not just words on the lips, but is is a public confession. So you see believing and confessing are vital and no one can be saved without it &gt;&gt; but they are steps to salvation not the totality of salvation &gt;&gt; they prepare the heart for the washing of the water by the word you know the burial of baptism the infilling of the Holy Ghost and it was Peter's pattern at Pentecost that shows the completion of what Paul was outlining in Romans Amen. &gt;&gt; So faith plants the seed. Confession waters the seed. Baptism buries the old man, his sin and his past. The spirit raises up new life. So I'm going to tell you, don't stop at believing and confessing. Walk on into Christ until he fills you with his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Romans 10 opens the door. Acts two brings the spirit into the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now then, so John Wesley now he wrestles with the fact that he and other believers were not cleansed from sin, but they were continuing right on in sin even though they had believed. And millions make this mistake at stepping at this stopping at this first step. They believe Christ intellectually and perhaps even sincerely, but they never go on to full surrender and to full infilling. They remain in conception without a birth. &gt;&gt; And Jesus told Nicodemus, except a man be born of the water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. So it's not enough to believe about the spirit. You must receive the spirit. Not enough to believe the message. Say, "I believe the message, brother Brandham." That's only being able to read. You must have the token. &gt;&gt; It's not as to say Jesus Christ is Lord. Christ must take the throne of the heart. &gt;&gt; So again, to be born of the of the water and the spirit, where are we? Okay, so you know, we must be born again of the water in the spirit. And and and as we look at this, I want to go right on to Wesley now. Wesley testified to both justification and sanctification as experiences in his own life in Alders Alders Gate Street, May 24th, 1738. He felt his heart strangely warmed as he trusted in Christ alone for salvation. This was his assurance of forgiveness. This he believed was his new birth experience. Later experience of sanctification happened in 1761 at a watch night service and Wesley recorded that he experienced what he had long preached was entire sanctification. Now, they would call this the second blessing, &gt;&gt; cuz you to them, they didn't argue that Luther was was born again when he was justified. &gt;&gt; But he just said, "You need a second blessing. &gt;&gt; You need sanctification." And so he wrote in his journal that I found witness of the spirit of God that he had taken away my sins and cleansed my heart from all unrighteousness. And after this, he was bolder in teaching that a believer could experience a second blessing here and now in this life, not just in heaven. And so he agreed with Luther that the sinner is pardoned and forgiven, declared righteous before God by faith and in Christ in Christ alone. And that this was the new birth. And the and what Wesley he would often call being born again, becoming a child of God. By justification, we are saved from the guilt of sin. By sanctification, we're saved from the power and the root and the root of sin. So he saw we needed a little more than just confession. &gt;&gt; We needed a cleansing. &gt;&gt; So he began to preach the second blessing, sanctification. So he taught that after conversion there often remained inbred sin or a carnal nature that still caused believers to struggle. And through the earnest seeking and consecration, a believer could experience an additional a distinct uh work of grace. And he called that entire sanctification or Christian perfection. And so this second blessing that he didn't think was a new birth itself, but a just a deeper cleansing of the heart and that it brought a freedom from the dominion of sin and and enabled a holy life and a and a love toward God and toward neighbor. And he thought the Lutheran were born again. to have justification, but they just stopped short of this second work of grace. And they they needed to go on to entire sanctification, be cleansed from the inward sin, and to be filled with perfect love. &gt;&gt; And so he would often say, "Justification is the porch, the new birth is the door, and sanctification is the house." This was all his preaching. But the truth of it was sanctification was not the indwelling of the spirit. &gt;&gt; It was only the preparation or the cleansing of the house &gt;&gt; for the spirit to indwell. &gt;&gt; Now here's what he thought. He believed that the goal of the gospel was not just to pardon but to bring holiness. He taught from these scriptures, this is the will of God, even your sanctification. So God's will for you is a sanctified life. Hebrews 12:14, follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. No man is going to see God unless he gets holiness. He began to preach from Ephesians 5 that Christ gave himself that he might sanctify and cleanse it, that he might present himself a glorious church without spot or wrinkle. And he saw this as a second work of grace. It was an experience of cleansing that went beyond justification. And brother Brandham, of course, would agree with this. He said, "This is th this is th this is very important. You must be sanctified before you get the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; And this is what he chastised the men all the way through 62. He was over and over again. He said they they're born again. In other words, they they have received um justification. They they believed by faith, but they're claiming to get the Holy Ghost and they're not even sanctified. Look at these women. They're still cutting their hair. They're still painting their face. Look at these men. They're still smoking. They're still drinking. All of these. And they're claiming, "I got the Holy Ghost because I spoke in tongues." He said, "You can't do it." &gt;&gt; You got to be sanctified first. God's not going to come in and dwell a spirit a vessel that is not clean. So as we are as we're looking at this for a moment and you know this he he had great experiences with God he believed that it was a spiritfilled meeting. Now it wasn't as dramatic outward signs like like tongues at Pentecost you know it was more often an inward assurance of cleansing, a release from inward struggle, an overflowing of love and joy in God. And and and he compared it to Acts 15, which says they purified their hearts by faith. And of course, many of them shout it when they received it. Rolled in the floor, danced in the spirit, got drunk. They listen, you think, "Well, that's the Holy Ghost." It was But it was only in the level of sanctification. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Just because of you roll in the floor, run down the aisle, jump in the pew, shout at the top of your voice, doesn't mean that it's not the Holy Ghost. Sure, it's the Holy Ghost on you, but it don't mean the Holy Ghost should come and dwell in you. That's right. &gt;&gt; We want to see what happened to you after you jumped. &gt;&gt; We want to see what took place after you shouted. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon would say they thought when they shouted they got it. And he said many of them thought when you get happy enough to shout you got it. But many of them shouted and didn't have it. You see, they got the emotion of it, &gt;&gt; but they failed to get the indwelling of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so now as we're looking at this, I I want to want to go on in this because you see things begin to change because originally it would come with such power, such anointing, such a move of the spirit until you it would even show physically on the individuals. they would have great ecstasy shouting and figning and trembling. Now Wesley did the right thing. He cautioned that the true evidence was not emotion but inward assurance and holy living. So he he put a emphasis not is not on the sh is on the holy living. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now, so the Methodists of John Wesley's era and the decades after his revival, there were full of dramatic revival scenes. There was shouting, figning, weeping, even people falling under the power. But by the mid to the late 1800s, much of this had changed. Now, let's talk about this change. Now remember it had changed from because of the nickelans from what happened in Acts two and brother Brandhams tells us in the second seal you can read it yourself when they begin to witness to the dignitaries and brought them into the church their bosses centurions and great men and whatever they it wasn't dignified him. &gt;&gt; They couldn't take to them people shouting and manifestations of the spirit. So they were embarrassed by it. So they wanted to dress it up. &gt;&gt; I'm using his words. Now, so now here in the reformation, I want you to notice here the spirit of God's moving and here the antichrist comes in with his doctrines of nickel because he wants to dress it up. So under Wesley and early Methodist preachers like George Whitefield, emotional outbursts were common. camp meetings in America, especially early early 1800s in Canidge, Kentucky. This is history you can read about. It was famous for people shouting, trembling, dancing, even falling as if dead. And these were seen as signs of deepening conviction and encounters with God. And Methodism was known as a shouting church. Now, Brother L, Brother L, &gt;&gt; when you left the Methodist church, was it still known as a shouting church? &gt;&gt; No. The shout had long gone. &gt;&gt; What was it now? Rituals and formalities. &gt;&gt; Now watch. In the mid mid 18 1800s there was a move among them of growing respectability. As Methodistism spread and became one of the largest denominations in America and Britain, it began to seek social respectability. The middle class members often felt embarrassed by the wildfire of the early revival scenes. Now, Brother Brandon would say, "I'd rather have wildfire than no fire." But by the 1840s and 1860s, many Methodist leaders began emphasizing order, education, and refinement in worship and emotional experiences were increasingly discouraged in the main Methodist church. Now, so what happened? They purposely distant themselves from dramatic manifestations for several reasons. One, a desire for social acceptance. As Methodists moved into the middle class, they wanted to be seen as respectable Christian, not emotional enthusiast. Then two, fear of disorder. You know, they had church order and they would actually church order the spirit out. Leaders feared the emotional outburst would give critics reason to attack the church as fanaticals. &gt;&gt; So they're embarrassed by these Holy Spirit moves. Then three, they had a theological change. By the mid 1800s, methodism emphasized moral improvement, education, social reform, temperance, abolition over revivalist experiences. So social problems and answers to them meant more than an experience with Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing a pattern? &gt;&gt; So by the late 1800s, Methodists, mainline Methodistism was mostly formal and restrained and institutional. And those who longed for the old fire. And there were those that did, they continued on into the holiness movement. How many brother here's brother Brandon talk about pilgrim holiness. &gt;&gt; Well, the Nazarines, &gt;&gt; they were the shouting Methodists. &gt;&gt; They wanted to continue on with the with the with the rejoicing, the joy of the Lord, the shout &gt;&gt; divine healing. They didn't you see the spirit was moving. And it's like the stalk the life was moving from that and moving now into another area. And brother Brandon would even call this the the the pilgrim holiness age. It was not another age but it was just a time where the spirit of God was moving and it moved now from the formal Methodist &gt;&gt; and was moving forward &gt;&gt; toward Isuza Street and finally the token. So now as you so you can see Methodism itself became respectable and quiet and these holiness outshoots offshoots they carried this shouting camp meetings style forward but hey it wasn't long they lost the shout &gt;&gt; because of why the desire for respectability &gt;&gt; not wanting to be fanatical. &gt;&gt; Having proper church order. There was a man by the name of Nathan Bangs. He was a Methodist leader in the 1800s. He was an early historian of American Methodism. And by 19 1838, he wrote critically of these older camp meetings. Now watch. There is no necessity for those convulsions of the body, those loud outcries, those violent agitations which sometimes attended revivals, they are not essential to to religion. We don't need it. They're not even necessary. We don't want them. We don't want them. We don't need it. And fact of the matter is they're just convulsions of the body, violent outcries and violent agitations and we don't want it. And he saw emotionalism as an embarrassment and he urged Methodists toward a calmer, more respectable style. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham told us and I read it last week in the Smyrnian age. He said when this nickel come in that wanted to get away from those clapping of hands and those shouting and the gifts of the spirit and whatever else he said it would they were bitter &gt;&gt; and he says smrna means bitter and they were filled with bitterness. They were bitter against the Holy Ghost movement. &gt;&gt; Now watch here was see here it is. Now I'm showing you the cycle of revival and death. Now, don't get in a hurry to go. I'm not even watching the time &gt;&gt; because I I've got somewhere I want to go. &gt;&gt; Now, Methodist Methodist Episcopal discipline, the Methodist Episcopal Church, the largest American Methodist body, began to emphasize order and decency in worship. And a line was often quoted from its discipline was let all things be done and decently and in order without confusion or noise. So they took the shouting out of the church. They took the moving of the Holy Spirit out. Watch now. This was deliberately aimed at suppressing shouting, figning, and ecstatic outburst. And I'll tell you what your prophet said. I may have the quote for it in a minute. He said, "If they would have just let them alone and would have not poured water in the face, he said they would have went on to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; So you have William Warren Sweet, a Methodist historian. Looking back, he summarized how Methodistism shifted. Methodistism having moved into the middle class, it had no desire to be regarded as religion of the ignorant and the emotional. It was becoming a church of respectability. And this was a conscience distancing from camp meeting enthusiasm. and early 1800 leaders like Nathan Baines wanted to suppress emotional outbursts calling them unnecessary. Um mid uh 1800 preachers like Henry Bone lamented the shouting Methodist was disappearing. Historians note that Methodistism deliberately became respectable and distanced itself from shouting and fainting. So here again he was now ignorant uneducated, immature. You hear me? &gt;&gt; Oh, if you're really in the mature in the word. &gt;&gt; So this is what as brother Brandham said they had myrr. It showed they were dying. Now, brother Brandham does say this. He said, "And you, oh, dear old Methodist, tonight Baptist here, that's what your father preached and believed years ago down here through the New England spa states here. When Wesley and Asbury come through here, they had to rent schools. They'd fall under the power of God. Lay there till the morning until the in the power of the Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit. They pour water and fam them with fans and everything. But you got starchy &gt;&gt; and got away. Not you, dear children, your pastors because they begin to think more of theology and doctrines than they did of letting the spir holy spirit have its way. And this is just the Holy Spirit continuing on in his church. Now he's describing what he had there in that meeting. So now again he says I look back upon them Lutheran, Methodists, Pentecostals, Nazarene, Pilgrim Holiness, all the great churches we have and I think in their early origins how they had a lifeline on them. the spirit, the Holy Spirit was in them and how God sent them of the rushing mighty wind like he did on the day of Pentecost and how they frolked in the blessings of God with with their heavy foliage on them and and the winds caught them like sails and sail back and forth revival after revival. But then there comes something that happened. The fires of persecution. Notice now the persecutions rising in the church itself &gt;&gt; against the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; it's not even from outside but they were afraid to be thought fanatical and he says watch now watch what he says when they got off into seminaries and got boys and men who were brilliant and intellectual and and taught out taught cut out the old baptism of the Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit. They cut the lifeline when the Methodist rivals revival used to strike in the nations where they'd lay in the school houses on the floor and receive the Holy Spirit and become knocked out as we call it today. And or in their days, they thought they'd fainted in our own Baptist church. I've seen that in our Baptist church. take pictures of water from the pulpit and pour it on the people's faces and fan them and cry when they were laying there under the power of the spirit. But the new teachers, what brother Bradom tells us in Christ the mystery, he says they all started out, but he said what got in the church was fallen angels &gt;&gt; who brought in Satan's life. Now what was Satan's lie that followed the church nickelanism and balamism? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch now the new teachers, the old country church was done away and they brought in the more elaborate, the more fantastic, the educated side of on the side of the altar being betterly decorated or the pipe organ and the seats all pushed and pushed and and the old church was done away with. The old altar take was taken. The oldfashioned martyr's bench was taken out and put down in the basement. Said, "Well, brother Tim, we don't believe in altar calls. You don't believe in altar calls." We do &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham in one of his last sermons said, "I want to have an oldfashioned altar call, &gt;&gt; God still moves in them." And he says instead of souls on the altar with liies on the altar instead of oldfashioned organ they used to pump with the stick or the tune old tuning for when they sang I'll fear no evil and I come to die. Instead of that it was a well-trained tri choir with melodious voice that sang such hymns until they would hold on to they were blue in the face and call it class. That's the most miserable thing I ever sat under was to hear an overtrained voice at a hold a note until they're blew in the face to try to put us on a show and that's all it is. You're not singing to the glory of God. And the sweetest thing under heaven is an oldfashioned spiritfilled church with the Holy Ghost. Everybody's singing in the spirit, but they cut the lifeline. When they cut the singing and when they taken the days of miracles away from the church and adopted their own theology and their intellectuals instead of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, they cut the lifeline. No doubt there are great denominations. So them was great. So is them great trees. They can prove by history they had done great things. The one that looked at this forest could prove they were once great thriving trees, but today they're nothing but bleak. The lifeline is gone. And he was viewing a burnover forest. &gt;&gt; And he says that when God sends his wind down for his trees to frolic and to take new life by the pushing of the trees, what to do? They set up a mournful sound. I'll tell this congregation, if any of them attend that divine healing campaign, immediately they'll be excommunicated from this fellowship. some little preacher with more intellectual than he's got sense to govern and stand up there with a tuxedo coat and bow with an amen like a calf and a man like a cow with a cramp and then try to to to place that to take the place of the Holy Ghost. It'll never do it. God's eternal plan of salvation for his people is the Holy Spirit in the church. born again men and women operated by the Holy Spirit. Not them trying to operate the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit operating in them. &gt;&gt; That's it. We don't need men trying to operate, trying to control the spirit. We need men and women under the control of the spirit. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit operating in them. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Well, we got here in the third exodus, him telling why they went back down to England, why why Israel had to leave the promised land, go to Egypt and become slaves. What made denominations? And he says the same thing has happened today. They got rid of Joseph because they didn't think they would need the supernatural. So they thought because our churches have become intellectual, we got the best dress crowds, the B biggest organization, the most smartest ministers that we have no use of the Holy Spirit the way it was back there. They are full, in other words, actions speak louder than words that their seminar is their brain of their being. They're coming together. They're discussing the thing are more able with their own intellectual mind to set a church in order better than what the Holy Spirit can do it. So they don't need it anymore. It's something we don't need today. It's the days of his past that now. Isn't that just right? We don't need the Holy Spirit to heal the sick. We got doctors. We don't need the Holy Spirit to speak with tongues. We are intellectual people. And when you do, you take right from your framework the lifeline. Jesus said to them Jews in that day, "Haven't you read that the stone that was rejected is the chief cornerstone that all the building is setting upon?" Now, you see what I mean? I'm sure you can catch that. The reason of it is they thought they would never have need of it. We don't need speakers with tongues. Oh, this is well after the seals. This is the third exodus. Brother Brandon saying they're saying we don't need speakers with tongue. We don't need interpreters of tongue. We no longer need Old Testament prophets to set us in order by the Holy Spirit. We understand that. And we are they have adopted a man-made system to take the place of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, there is a people &gt;&gt; that's elected &gt;&gt; that has their name on the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; They can't go for that. &gt;&gt; They are spiritual minded and therefore they cannot go for that. They cannot stand it no matter if their fathers and mother lived in whatever organizational church. Amen. &gt;&gt; When a church does that, maybe it wouldn't speak it right out. Oh no, they wouldn't speak it out, but their actions prove it. Here's the word. The Holy Spirit proves it among them. And he'll get them ga he when he can get them gathered together, he still heals the sick. He raises the dead, speaks with tongue, cast out devil. So it depends what's on the inside the person. The church feels they don't need the Holy Spirit. The church will tell you that the man will stand up and give you such an intellectual talk can almost make you to believe it. Now stop there here a minute. Didn't Jesus say the two would be so close together it would deceive the very elected if it was possible? The intellectual talks would be so smooth that it would deceive the people. It's the gospel is men who can handle that word in such a way that he could almost make any intellectual person, if you're trusting in your intellectual, they would condemn the Holy Spirit and take the way of man. &gt;&gt; Now, so as you can see, here's what the prophet taught. And of course, in the indictment, he tells you what they're doing. They are crucifying the effects of the gospel. Now, did Methodists still preach from the Bible? Did they still sing songs? Did they still have orders and worships and bishops and men and preachers and priests and churches and organizations? Yes. But they crucified the effects of the gospel. by their creeds. That's the crucifixion. That's where the public sets and these big morgs called churches, denominations draw a line of creed. The word of God can't have effect upon them because they condemn the very things that Christ said would take would take place. It just doesn't come accord according to their creed. So, brother Brandham tells us in Palmer, canker, locust, cankerworm. He said, "You know what was once a tree, that's a Pentecostal church, too got the hardest kick I ever got about divine healing was from an Assembly God man." That's Trinity Pentecost. We had an armory down at Hot Springs, Arkansas. We couldn't have enough seats. We had several thousand people. He had a great lot of seats. And anybody that believed in divine healing couldn't even set on his seats. That's what he said. Oh my, what a shame. What's the matter? What's the same thing? You've taken the route of the dead tree. What the palm worm left the canker. The Baptist took away the the shouting away from the Methodist. One eat this and one eat that until they stripped the church down until they got themselves sitting just as dead as a doornail. No spirit, no shouting, no joy, no peace, no healing, no nothing. what the Bapt the Methodists left the Baptist eating. What the Baptist left the Cathell eating or some other church and this one eat this and this and took away that and this and took that away and you ain't got nothing but just a church creed. And you know that's the truth. &gt;&gt; But God said I will restore. &gt;&gt; There's a restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not going to leave us a stripped down tree. &gt;&gt; So we find that the old palmer one took the joy away. &gt;&gt; You know, David said that he lost the joy of his salvation. He didn't lose his salvation. He just lost the joy of it. I tell you, there's some people like him. Write that right here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. You had lost your salvation. You just lost the joy of it. And he said, "Lord, restore to me the joy of thy salvation." &gt;&gt; Like, and so this little palm worm begin to eat that fruit of joy out. And look at here. You people make too much noise. I tell you all this crying, this saying amen, this shouting, that's nonsense. There's nothing to that. See, first thing you know, he sat in a big morg, you know, sat there all them dead. Some of these inbalming fluids of so-called doctrine of creeds pumped into their veins where the spirit of God ought to be running where the old church creed pumped in there. No wonder they're icy and cold and dead. spiritual thermometer 90 degrees below zero. Yeah. Somebody say amen. And everybody struck stretch their neck around like some kind of goose or something. Want to know what it said? It's a shame when the spirit of God ought to be joy, peace, love. But this little bug started eating on it and he ate all the joy away. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you're not a tree. I'm just saying the the palmer worm has got to you. &gt;&gt; It's taken away the lifeline. How many times have I read it already that brother Brandon said, "This was the lifeline." &gt;&gt; Where the spirit moved in the body? &gt;&gt; I happened to look that night when the wind was blowing. It was stiff and dead and there moaning and groaning. Didn't have no light to bend with, no bark to make it flexible. And it was just moaning and groaning with the wind. Oh my. Doctor so and so said so and so. Oh my. But I happen to notice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I happened to notice. &gt;&gt; I happened to notice. &gt;&gt; I happened to notice down underneath there &gt;&gt; was some undergrowth coming up &gt;&gt; some little bushes about like that. They had life in them. And when the spirit began to hit them, they were just twisting and ringing and shouting and having a glorious time. Let me tell you, brother, God's going to raise up a generation of people out of all this dead stuff that's going to restore, says the Lord. God's going to raise up people who believes in signs and wonders. And going to raise up people who's got joy unspeakable and full of glory. And when the mighty Russian wind comes, it gives right to it. And it frolics and dances and glorifies God. and green leaves are clapping your hand and having a wonderful time. Hallelujah. What if you're moaning? If you're moaning about, I rejoice. If you're moaning and groaning because we shout, if you're moaning and groaning, you're just an old tree. But I tell you, there's someone there's a life in it. &gt;&gt; And when the spirit moves, they got to move with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the holy and woundedness movement notice cycle of revival and death. Holiness movement rose reaction trying to recover the fiery experiential side Wesley had championed. So this same drift had happened in Methodistism. It would happen in Isus movement and it's now happening in the message. And the message is dying. The movement not the message. The movement is dying. From revival fire to growth and organization to respectability to co cooling off. Emotional outbursts are downplayed. Holiness is softened. Whirlenness seeps in. The warning of Leoa applies. Because thou art lukewarm &gt;&gt; and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth. At Pentecost, carrying the cycle now. At Pentecost, there was the fiery beginning. The spirit fell. Believers spoke in other languages. They prophesied. They had power. In Acts four, the place was shaken with when they prayed and then they were filled with boldness. The early church lived with supernatural fire, miracles, and separation from the world. This was the upper room birth of the church. Pure spiritfilled, unashamed. &gt;&gt; Amen. These are not drunk as you suppose, &gt;&gt; but this is that which the prophet Joel spoke. They were not ashamed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were not embarrassed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Peter didn't say, "Listen, I better start a bunch of church order here. You done got a little wild here. There's too much wildfire here." He said, "No, let's fan the flames. Why don't you get it, too? &gt;&gt; Let it catch on to somebody else. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Receive the Holy Ghost and 3,000 caught on fire. &gt;&gt; More than the 120. &gt;&gt; So then the drift toward respectability began immediately after Pentecost. The fire of the spirit was resisted by the deeds of the nickel. What was once a spontaneous spiritled people became grow gradually formalized and controlled and the church gained respectability in the world but it lost its simplicity and its power. And so here comes the rise of the nickelanism. His power lays in his doctrine. He is an impersonator and the rise of there was his first seeds of formalism. So he said but this thou hast thou hatest the deeds of nickel. So already in the first age they were working in revelation 2:15 to Pergamus. So thou hast them that hold the doctrine of nicicoatans, which thing I hate. &gt;&gt; The nickelans were among those were were those who began to establish a clerical order, separating clergy from leoty, attempting to make the church structured, respectable, and authoritative in the eyes of the world. And so what began as deeds in Ephesus became doctrine by Pergamus. So you see it's slowly closing in. And so as this happened there becomes a drift toward respectability and it sought the church sought to be seen as respectable by the Roman society. And by the third century Christianity began adopting rituals and hierarchies drifting from the s fiery simplicity of acts. And they modeled after the Old Testament priesthood and the pagan rights of the pagans. And leaders emphasize order and theology over the direct leading of the spirit. And the same shift began from fire to form, from spirit to structure. Watch now until we finally come to the full compromise which was Constantine and he legalized Christianity and the church was wedded to the state and it was there that it gained respectability but it lost its power and its purity. Pagan practice was mingled with Christian ritual and the church became a worldly institution and the cycle was complete. fire, growth, respectability, compromise and the church went into death. So the pattern has repeated in every age. In the early age was the acts then the nickels come in. Finally Rome then the reformation Luther's fire becomes Luther's formalism and God raises up Wesley and Wesley's fire gives a way to Methodist respectability and Pentecostal Isuza fire it became denominational Pentecostal respectability. So every revival started in fire and ended in form. And remember, it is a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. Now, I want you to watch the prophetic eye that warns us about what will happen. And in one of his and I'm taking some very of his last sermons that he preached and he said in the message of shame, notice the title, ashamed, embarrassed. &gt;&gt; Embarrassed. And this is what the church became embarrassed. &gt;&gt; Methodists became embarrassed. Luther's became embarrassed. Those old old ones there from the book of acts became embarrassed. &gt;&gt; What a respectability. Notice the same thing. Someone says, "Are you a Christian?" Oh, it's a popular thing. Say, "I'm a Christian." But do you believe the word of God which said these signs shall follow them that believe? You know what that says? In my name, they'll cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; In my name, they will speak with new tongues. &gt;&gt; In my name, they'll do marvelous works. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; These signs follow them that believe. And oh, even ministers faces will blush. Are you ashamed, say, of divine healing? Some don't even want prayer lines no more. &gt;&gt; Forbid them. Are you ashamed of the full gospel? Are you ashamed of your Pentecostal experience? Oh, I bet they are. &gt;&gt; That's being ashamed of his word. &gt;&gt; That's his word made flesh in you. So, brother Brandham in one of his last sermons here before he leaves that one some of the last messages of the seventh angel that he imparts. He asks, "Are you ashamed? Will you be ashamed? Will this message go down like all the others and be ashamed and embarrassed? And you know, oh yeah, this caused the church become the prostitute of revelation 17. The deeds of the nickelans, the teachings of balamism, substituted rituals for the new birth. And that's what we did, just rituals. Come up, say, I believe the message. I'm going to go baptize you. You go down a dry center and come up a wet one. &gt;&gt; Rituals. Turn it into rituals and deny the experience. And then he likens it to the modern woman today. If you'll listen to invisible union, he tells you how the woman does not want to bear children anymore. She would rather party. She don't want to stretch out her body. She wants to keep her physique. She does not want children that would embarrass her. And so he talks about he talks about spiritual or shall we say he talks about them using birth control to keep from having children. And of course today you know they even use abortion as form of birth control. They'll actually kill the unborn. Now, we're bringing it right down to preachers and to the church. And he said, "That is a true picture of the modern church today. Neither does this modern church want any of them screaming, shouting, tongue speaking." Acts 2:38, youngest around her. Yeah. She don't want any of them hoofing and crying and screaming. Amen. Hallelujah. Wow. Such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination. They had like one like that in one of the churches. I'd throw her out right quick. Why are you letting such stuff as this go along? What are they doing? Practicing spiritual birth control, &gt;&gt; killing the unborn, &gt;&gt; of burning the baby murdered &gt;&gt; from the pull pit. You say, "Brother Tim, they don't do it." Brother Brandham said they're guilty of murder &gt;&gt; indictment. &gt;&gt; They're not only murdering Christ, they're murdering his offspring &gt;&gt; until the church does not have the strength to bring forth. &gt;&gt; Atmospheres are never created for a birth. &gt;&gt; Now, so again, we come right down here. This is a true picture of the modern church. Watch. Let's see if I can get this to go one more time. There we go. So, she's pregnantated with something cuz she's bringing forth members all the time. But she don't want none of them screaming, hollering, blabbering. Acts 2:38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are. Well, that would certainly embarrass her. It would ruin her and her educated, ethical, scientific society church that she belonged to here. They would throw her out at the next council. She can't have it. So she don't want to be pregnantated with the word &gt;&gt; because that's the only kind. &gt;&gt; Is somebody with me? &gt;&gt; That's the only kind &gt;&gt; that the word can bring forth. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Tim, today we want a born of the word. We want a born of the message. Well, if you want a born of the message, it's Acts chapter 2:38. Repent, be baptized, or be filled with the Holy Ghost. That's the new birth. Born of the spirit of God. It has a spirit of God. Not intellectual church join creep going bob hair painted faith. There are no such thing as that that at all. You don't find that in the word of God. You find an oldfashioned sanctified Holy Ghost fililled child born of the spirit of God screaming, shouting, hollering, praising God. This is only a month before he leaves, before his voice is silenced. Notice what she loves. Watch her lover. You want to see who she's in love with? The word says it. Well, my church says that. Who she in love with? Who's her husband? Her own fruits proves what she is exactly right. shows what she has noticed. She was born first to Adam. That because that's her natural birth and she's never left that. That's a lover of the world. She claims she is born the second time to Christ. But her lover notices Adam yet because she loves the world. And notice what kind of children she is bearing. That tells what their papa is. Whether it's the first Adam or the second Adams. If the church brings forth a child of the second Adam, that's Jesus Christ. He acts the second way of Adam's second way. The second Adam's way of acting like they did on the day of Pentecost. That's really true. Second Adam's children. See, their nature's like his and hers. Yes. Her daughter's painted face, bobbed hair, wearing men's clothes, trouser. The Bible says not to do it. She cuts her hair. It's a shame to her. Why? She don't want to be inconvenience with children. We don't want them screaming around the altar. We don't have to spend time praying through with them. We we we just want a an easy fix and say you believe the message and you got it. Brother Brandon told us that people would come afraid of the new birth. &gt;&gt; Said they're afraid of it. He said, "I don't care what level you come. It's on. It's in it's a mess. If it's out yonder in a pig pen, any birth is a mess. If it's in a pig pen, if it's in a couch stable, it's in a pink decorated hospital room. I don't care where the birth takes place. It's a mess. And a new birth is the same. It'll make you do things you didn't think you would do. You might cry boohoo and round rub around an altar. No matter what you do, I've never asked God. It wouldn't do any good to try to bring the new birth to my level. I want to meet God's level of the new birth and receive it. I don't care what I have to do. &gt;&gt; Someone said, "I'm afraid to receive the Holy Ghost. I'm afraid it might make me speak in tongues like them others. I don't care if I spoke in tongues, talked in tonesues, crowed in tonesues, or anything else. I want the Holy Ghost. That's the main principle. I don't care what level is. I meet God on his level." Amen. That's where I want to stand. What he says is right. The new birth that changes a man, changes a woman, changes a desire, changes the appetite. Wrestle with God until you can hold on to the blessing comes. That's what happened to Jacob. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look at this title. A deceived church by the world. Where do we start with this? Matthew 24:24. When I started teaching you three Sundays, two Sundays ago, three Sundays ago, deception. Here's where the great Leodysia, the most deceiving age. And brother Brandon's preaching to his own church, a deceived church by the world. That's the reason people go and join organization and substitute, what's the word? Substitute, a handshake instead of the new birth. They're trying to baptize baptize the new birth. They don't want the new birth. They know we teach it in the Bible. So, they want to substitute something for it. And the Pentecostal people are just as bad trying to substitute something. They want want it in class. It must be so classy. We'll shake hands, join the church, be sprinkled, be baptized, something. They're afraid of the new birth. I sometimes believe the Brandom Tabernacles getting afraid of it. And it did. Even now they'll condemn the Pentecostal experience &gt;&gt; and say the token is a tape. &gt;&gt; Now we know what a birth is. I don't care where it is whereabouts. It's a mess. A baby's born on a sh pile on a hollowed floor in a pink decorated hospital room is a mess. Anyhow, a birth of a cat, birth of anything else is a mess. And he teaches us all the way through 65. And the new birth is nothing less than a mess. But people get so starchy. We'll go over where they shake hands. We'll go over where they don't ball and cry and beat on the altar and cry out. You want to be too human. &gt;&gt; And what we need is a birth dying out to bring forth new life. &gt;&gt; Where's our power? Where's our glory? What is it? Because we went out the wisdom of man and stood the power of God. Our preachers and things is so stiff and starchy till they organize us. till we're so starchy and stiff necked to people. You'll never hear a shout in the church anymore. You'll never hear anybody cry. The mourers's is put in the basement. There's no more glory in the church. All we said is do is sit back just as stiff as we can. We're not free. We're bound. The devil with his modernistic demons has bound the church of the living God. There's no power in the church. There's no more freedom. The people are starchy and stiff. What the God can come in the midst of Pentecostal people and show he's God and proves the signs of his resurrection it don't shake them glory why is it it's a disgrace I walk across the country God performing working performing signs and people sat and say well I guess that's all right oh I know it can be done it doesn't move them they're bound with Delilah the world they are in fears &gt;&gt; now They've even got them into bound into a confederation. The Philistines are on these Samson. What are you going to do about it? Oh, we got great denomination. Sure. We got greater memberships than we ever had. But where's the spirit? Where is the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; That's what the devil's done. It's wooed the church. It's kept wooing the church. Come to me. I'll give you a big great big tabernacle over here if you'll just do this. If you'll get rid of that fanatic preacher and you got and get a man of doctor divinity that's got some sense, we'll build a nice big classical church, we'll be like the rest of them. Shame on you. I'd rather have a man that didn't know split coffee from beans but was filled with the Holy Ghost that was uncompromised by the power of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, but it's got so starchy till some poor saint can break through in the meeting and speak in tongues or shout a little bit and something or something the rest of them will all gander about around and look and say, "What was that?" Well, I wonder why. That must be some fanatic dropped in somewhere. You know that's the truth. Some poor saints step in, get happy enough to raise their hands and cry and praise the Lord. And somebody will holler amen to the preaching of the gospel. And the rest of them turn around and see. See what he said? That's Pentecostals. What's the matter? You're patterned after the Methodist, after the Baptist. They patterned after the Catholic. And the Catholic patterned after hell. And all together, they're all after hell. &gt;&gt; What an indictment. Nickelans, a doctrine from hell, &gt;&gt; came into the Lutheran and then the Westwinds patterned after it &gt;&gt; and the Baptists and then the Pentecostals. And now we're wanting to do it in the message &gt;&gt; because they want a pattern after hell instead of the original pattern which is Acts chapter 2. Delilah has wooed you into big churches. Find educated ministers. Take the better class. Well, you know, such and so. Here's a millionaire. We could just get him to come in our congregation. Oh my. If he isn't born again, then he doesn't deserve to be there. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. &gt;&gt; I don't care if he's a millionaire. If he ain't born again, he don't deserve to be in the church. &gt;&gt; He needs to be at the altar. &gt;&gt; If he owns 40 Cadillacs, whatever he's got, he's got to be born again. Come right down to a new birth, be regenerated, and come out there with a new birth, naughty, excuse me, a crying and screaming and carrying on like the rest of them do. And live a life outwards to prove it. He's got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what you knew in the Samson. The Philistines upon you. Communist is upon you. The world's upon you. The devil's upon you. So here we come. I'm going to conclude. I've read all these quotes. I've showed you the decline. I've showed you the spirit of nickelanism has moved right now and it's moved right into the message. But right now for the next few minutes and I'm going to be a little longer today, but I want you to understand the cycle breaks. This cycle of revival and death breaks in the end time bride. &gt;&gt; We will not continue this cycle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This last age is not promised another cycle. &gt;&gt; There's no more ages to come. That's right. &gt;&gt; There is not another cycle of re of revival, fire, and death, but a final cycle, &gt;&gt; a final harvest of a bride made ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, after the grain, the only thing left is the garner. &gt;&gt; And we have reached the grain. &gt;&gt; We're not another part of the stock that will die. &gt;&gt; That the spirit will leave and move into another form. The only place we can move is upward. &gt;&gt; The only place we can go is higher. &gt;&gt; The only way we can get out of here is a rapture. &gt;&gt; And we will not be a people left behind. And God's not going to abandon his church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are here at harvest time. It's the end of the world. There's no more to come after this. We are sealed to the day of redemption. And the marriage of the lamb has come and there's a people been made ready. Receive the token and the life. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's been churches, churches, bride, bride, churches, churches. But there's got to come one. There has to come a real bride. There's got to come one that's not only got the mechanics, but the dynamics to go with it. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach now. &gt;&gt; Amen. in a church with not just mechanics &gt;&gt; but the dynamics &gt;&gt; predestinated Christ's a mystery there's a mystery he before Christ anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery he chose a bride knowing ease would fall from disbelieving the word knowing she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall &gt;&gt; amens church was predestined to go down in the ground. &gt;&gt; Wesley and Luther, all they were predestined to come out, but they would die as the stalk. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you're not stalk, little children. You're the grain. &gt;&gt; And you have a different destiny. &gt;&gt; Your destiny is not failure. &gt;&gt; Your destiny is not defeat. Your destiny is not to lose your fire. Your destiny is not formalism. Your destiny is you are predestinated not to fall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A people predestinated. That's your destiny. That's what you're called to. That's the hour that we're in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are people who will break the cycle of revival and death because you don't have a partial prescription. You have the token, &gt;&gt; the literal life of Jesus Christ that inoculates you against failure, that inoculates you against going into decline, that inoculates you from ever losing the spirit. You're not gonna lose little children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the word. It's not just emotion. Oh, many revivals begin with the spirit and the word, but then drift into form, replacing which is formalism &gt;&gt; and the word with tradition. But let me tell you about this bride. She's word born, &gt;&gt; wordfed, word sealed. &gt;&gt; She are she is his disciples indeed because she will not stop. &gt;&gt; She will continue in his word. And if you continue in my word, you are my disciples indeed. There's a people continuing, not stopping. &gt;&gt; So we break the cycle. We break the cycle by maturity, by adoption, by coming the mature grain we were at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; We're no more servants, but we're sons. &gt;&gt; We are here in the revealing, the apocalyp, the manifestation of the sons of God. sons placed in maturity that will not return to the petty childess childlessness and immaturity of wanting social respectability over the power of the spirit. You call me immature because I want the Holy Ghost in his power, &gt;&gt; but I'm saying you are the child &gt;&gt; because you are you are a Lutheran or a Baptist or Method or something else. You have not come in advance. If you advance into maturity, you'll never choose social respectability over the power of the Holy Ghost. And we break the cycle by the rapture. &gt;&gt; Every other revival ended in decline because they were part of the weak drawing through the stages. But when the wheat bride comes to full maturity, she is harvested. Listen to me now. Not left to rot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not going to be left to rot. But because you're mature grain, you're going to go in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. How? In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise, and we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is answer. We break the cycle of revival and death &gt;&gt; because we're not repeating Pentecost decline or Methodist respectability. &gt;&gt; We are the harvest sealed by the token &gt;&gt; and destined for glory. &gt;&gt; We have received the eternal prescription, &gt;&gt; the inoculation against sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have received the sin cure. &gt;&gt; And the cycle of unbelief is over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say you broke it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You broke it. We're not going down. Those whose names are on the book of life will not stand for that. &gt;&gt; We will have the power of God. We will have the moving of the spirit. We will have the shout of the king. We will have all the word, the fullness of the word, and the power of that word. We will live in it, walk in it, talk in it, and enjoy it and experience it. Let us stand together and rejoice. &gt;&gt; You are breaking the cycle. &gt;&gt; You are refusing to cave &gt;&gt; to the persecution &gt;&gt; that says, "Oh, but you make too much noise." Listen, friend. where I come from, &gt;&gt; there's lots of noise. &gt;&gt; I can show you in Revelation chapter 5 where we're where the redeemed people are all gathered there &gt;&gt; and the seals have been taken off of the book &gt;&gt; and the Bible said all creation heard me saying glory and honor and power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything begin to cry out. All creation begin to worship God. &gt;&gt; I tell you what then, church, it's time that you and I reflect who we are in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can reflect right now here on earth that the shout of the king is in our midst. That the glory of God is upon his people and the spirit of God can fill this place and your heart. God bless you. [Music] There were people almost everywhere that fell at Pentecost and made them clean. It is burning now within my heart. Glory to his name. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. here. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them in the upper room all praying in his name. They were baptized with the Holy Ghost. What he did for them that day, he'll do for you the same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I've heard first. And though these people may not learn to be nor they have all received their Pentecost baptized in Jesus name and are telling now both far and wide power is just the same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Oh, come my brother. Seek this blessing. Let your hearts and we'll start the joy bells ringing. Keep your soul a flame. It is burning now within my heart. Glory to his name. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. One of them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm Oh, I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them.

I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Lord has brought me through all of my trials without. [Music] But he stood right by me through all of my trles. When I was lost, he didn't let me go. He took my sin and he saved my soul. He cleaned me up and he made me whole. Jesus died on Calvary so the whole wide world could see. It was a great thing that he did for me. Oh, it was a great thing that he did for me. Yes, it was a great thing. How he set me free.

He's been my comforter. Oh, when I was lonely. And when I was lost, Jesus took me, well, he took my sins. &gt;&gt; And he saved my soul. He cleaned me up and he made me whole.
