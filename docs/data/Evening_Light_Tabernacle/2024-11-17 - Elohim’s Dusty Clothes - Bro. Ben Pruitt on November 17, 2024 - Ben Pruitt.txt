certainly uh had a wonderful time it was just a great time together and uh I love it when we can get together and just have some uh oldfashioned and fellowship and just have a lots of fun and things together and togetherness is you know something reminds us we're going to be in heaven we're going to be together and it's not going to be boresome nobody's going to have to uh slip in a game of you know uh to keep you entertained or something else you know no it'll be Adventures Beyond Adventures I have not seen nor ear heard amen and what has what is promised to us as his children but it has been revealed we we get glimpses of it and we thank God for those glimpses of Eternity what a day that will be God bless you you can have your seats we certainly um love the Lord today and thankful for you know his goodness in our lives and this goodness that he brings us and His blessings um they some sometimes just overflow and God just gives us great things and and this message produces great um great people great um families and great young people and we thank God for that we have today um sister Lauren Adams who we all know and been a part of this church not only um her uh her immediate family but then her grandparents and you know brother Jerry sh was um a um Deacon here at the church and sister Rachel's been uh just a real blessing to us through the years and a stalard Christian and supporter of the Gospel of Jesus Christ so you know it's a great legacy and um you know but as things come along and I I remember some years ago now it's um I've been it seemed like day before yesterday it was brother Joe and sister Jessica pledging together and marriage and like I said the message produces great people and and and and wonderful wonderful children of God and in turn that produces great families and those great children and grow up and they also become um Born Again of the spirit because we can't pass this on intellectually or just because that we attended a church but you have to be born again because no matter how good a parents we had that does not give us a right to the kingdom of God we have to be everyone have that individual experience with God but anyway sister Lauren has you know come to a point in life and now has fallen in love and and uh there was a young man founder all the way from Kentucky and as brother Weston Powell and the Powell family are also a really wonderful family I've known I've known um the Mom's family for many years and and been friends of mine and so you know all this is just connections and the blessings of God so today I want to announce um sister Lauren Adams brother Weston Powell they're going to be pledging their wedding vows sometimes in the spring and so today we are just announcing the engagement upcoming marriage and giving thanks to the Lord if they'll just come down here just for a moment everybody know who they are and uh this also is a part of our records here just to you know as we just are so thankful For What the Lord Has Done His blessings has never failed us and they just keep on giving the blessings of God and amen what a wonderful thing that God does with young people it changes their lives transform them by the transforming power and and then you know when we get the Holy Ghost that's the greatest thing we could ever get is eternal life but then when we find the next best thing in life and that is a a mate a Godly mate I think about my own wife I I said to her many times I said everything that I have everything that I possess all the children I have even the church I said not discounting God and his great mercies and Grace but I would have had none of this without you because the wrong woman would have changed everything but you see when we wait on God and this is this is the real truth on marriage and divorce issues if you wait on God and you get a revelation then that's your mate forever amen there's there's there shouldn't be never no thing such as divorce in the in the house of the Living God it should always be we marry by Revelation amen and you know as I think of this you know with this family and how many binds together we also have The Adams Family brother

coming by our way Lord we thank you for the promise that where two or three are gathered together I will be in their midst and we believe that today God so we believe you're here and we feel your

something and if we there be some need represented Lord I pray that it would be met today we believe that you're the almighty God you're able to take care of sickness you're able to deliver from everything and I pray God that you'd do that today if there's one here who never met you I pray you'd help them to come to you today fill them with the Holy Spirit we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you this morning we're going to read from Genesis Chapter 18 Genesis ch chap 18 veres 1-5 it's such a privilege to be here and just always feels like I'm at home when I'm here and thankful to brother Tim and brother Timothy for their friendship over the years and the friendship of this church and so I bring greetings from our church and brothers there and from Brother Joel and the other ministers there and um they're just glad to get a break for me this morning and uh I'm sure you all uh come you got such a wonderful pastor and ministry here in the church you know I feel like I'm coming in just as a spare tire but I believe God is still the same yesterday today and forever regardless of the preacher he's still able to do whatever he wants to do so we just want to give him Freedom today to do that that's our desire Genesis Chapter 18 and verse one we'll get right into the word today we enjoyed the Fall Festival yesterday my wife's here with me and my family and we sure enjoyed that and and just had a good time in the Lord Genesis 18:1 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said I want to speak to you this morning on elohim's Dusty clothes you may be seated Abraham is sitting in the door of his tent in the afternoon heat thinking on the goodness of God I think it'd do us good to begin to reflect this morning as we begin on the goodness of God and he's looking around thinking about his life and the things that he's been through and and maybe even was thankful for the tree that he was sitting under as I know your pastors preached about that tree and and there there was a a restored tree that he could sit under when when the day is hot and I think we ought to be thankful for one another we ought to be thankful for the leaves of Fellowship that we have that we can draw a shade from that we ought to be thankful uh for the fact that we can come together on a Sunday morning and we got a place to come together and we got people to come together with it's easy to find something to pick at or to fuss or to fight with one another over but you know when sheep get hot they huddle together because they draw shade one from another and I think that's the way we ought to be in the message as a whole not just in this church or in in our church at home but I think we ought to be willing to come together and draw shade one from the other and and gain that Fellowship because we need one another we don't want to pick too much at one another or we'll end up devouring one another we Paul said be careful that you don't that you don't uh that you don't bite and and devour cuz he said you might be consumed of one another and if there's ever been an hour that we needed one another it's today if there's ever been an hour we ought to reflect on the goodness of God to bring us together it ought to be right now because we need one another more than we've ever needed one another Abraham had been strong in faith he had been a man that was uh willing to believe God whatever God spoke to him he just did what God Said I think that's the kind of people we ought to be today the kind of people that just believe God whatever God says that's what I'm going to do Lord I'm going to follow your word I'm if the word that's just what I'm going to do and so Abraham was that kind of a guy he just believed God and so he remembered how good God had been to him he remembered what it was like being in her the caldes and being just another guy and just another person that could thank you buddy just another uh just another Gentile like all the rest of them in that great Wicked City but he remembered hearing the voice of God that called him out of that place and called him and set him on a journey that would lead him to the promised land and I'm so grateful that I've been called out and you've been called out we've been LED on that same Journey a journey of faith that we've got to we're not done yet church we got a little little way left to go what are we going for we're headed to a body change we're going somewhere one of these mornings we're we're oh Church we're not going to be worried about old bodies anymore but it's going to change in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're going to see our loved ones again and like Abraham we believe that Abraham sitting under the tree like we're sitting in the church this morning believing that God has done wonderful things for us now he's sitting there in the door of a house and there's there's another reason why he's in the door is because you know when things aren't real good in the tent you tend to go outside and and that morning Sarah was fussy brother brandham gives us that detail about Sarah she was fussy that morning like we are sometimes you come to church like that this morning you come fussy I see it on some of your faces ones that I can see cuz I forgot my glasses but I always forget something it's a running joke but but you you know you you you come fussy to church and so she wasn't ready for a visitation from God she wasn't ready to receive from the angel but Abraham was he he had the right attitude when he come to church but she had an attitude of of of fussiness she was she was worried about what lot was doing and what Lot's wife was doing and and what kind of dresses that they wore and and how that Abraham had brought them out in this dusty place in this in this hard harsh environment and she's sitting there worried about what everybody else is doing and she was looking at at what was happening down in Sodom but God was about to do something for her and about to do something for him that would completely change the trajectory of their life but Abraham was ready for it he was sitting in the tent door he wasn't he didn't mind what was going on behind in the T he was sitting in the tent door watching the road in the right atmosphere to receive from God Abraham had been strong in faith but he was full of mistakes that ought to give us Comfort today brother Bram said that about Abraham he was full of mistakes he he had all kinds of problems that he had he had said things he shouldn't have said lied about who his wife was and all kinds of different things that he did but when his Divine obituary was written in Romans chapter 4 the story of his life was written it wasn't even mentioned in it said he staggered not at the promise of God he did not waver in the midst of battle don't you want that to be your story when you get to the end of it when it's written about you he staggered not he was a Believer he stood for the message of the hour he did not waver in the midst of battle he grew stronger every day that's that's marvelous he had been tested and tried but he made it that's right he was 99 years old now that's old even back then that was old and he stood when lot left when Sarah was grouchy when when his own body broke down and you know a Abraham's body was testifying against him right his body was testifying you're old but he was testifying I'm going to have a child right his his circumstances were testifying against him but Abraham determined no matter what the rest of them says what no matter what the rest of them do as for me in my house we will serve God I wonder how many of you young people would make that determination today how many of you families would make that determination this young couple that just got engaged make a determination as for me in my house we're going to serve God we're going to follow God we're going to do what's right thank you buddy now I can see if the rest of them says there's nothing to the experience brother BR said it's a bunch of excitement as for me and my house will'll serve God though there be tattlers coming to church I know this doesn't happen here but just other places though there be tattlers coming to church though there be Twisters though they there be all kinds of false prophets and everything coming to the church in the amongst the people in the neighborhood and everything but for me in my house we'll serve the Lord he said though all of them quit coming though the church gets cold and different me and my house will serve the Lord listen he's not going to Rapture us as a church he's not going to Rapture us as a group of people he's going to Rapture individuals our bodies are going to be changed individually and you got to make a determination I'm going to stand if all the other young people don't stand I'm going to believe if all the other people don't believe I'm going to preach if everybody else quits preaching and everybody follows the trend of the age I'm going to keep doing what God called me to do maybe I should have left my glasses off are you with me this morning though somebody was prayed for he said and didn't get well that has nothing to do with it for me in my house we serve the Lord that's the attitude that Abraham had and God had revealed himself to Abraham in Genesis 17 as the almighty God when he was 9 and9 years old the Lord appeared to Abram said to him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and brother brandham tells us that Abraham believed God then because he had an approach through a symbol through a name but he said we do as well he said so have we an approach through a name Jesus what does Jesus mean to us savior amen else should I to Abraham satisfier strong one salvation Giver strength Giver the same thing that El shouldi was to Abraham Jesus is to the believer do you understand that this morning he's our strength Giver he's our strong one he's our salvation giver why was Abraham in the condition that he was in because he had met elai and he was drawing strength to become stronger every day in faith to believe when the miracle took place so brother BR said when Christians begin to get that Satan begins to get ready to leave you don't you love it when Satan starts packing up don't you love to see the devil start packing up aren't you ready in your house or in your life or whatever is going on for the devil to start packing his bags he said when Christians begin to get that he's finished when people say I don't care no matter no certain healer has to come by no certain this has to happen the only thing I want on Earth to hear is that God said so and that settles with me right then I'll take it and go from there oh that's my desire today I want to know that God said so Hallelujah Abraham had to have this Revelation so he would recognize the power that this this Elohim had when he come down and appeared in flesh now he appeared to Abraham in this name and while he appeared to him in this name and Abraham recognized who he was he changed Abraham's name he he put a part of his own name in Abraham's name and brother BR says now he's come to the fullness of believing the fullness of oh church I believe that's where we're at I believe we're in the fullness of believing we got to come to a place where we believe all the word of God see he said where the church has come he said I hope you can read between the lines come up to the place where he's revealed to him who he was and then he changed Abraham's name so that the promise could be fulfilled and Abraham is sitting there under his tree and the door of his tent In the Heat of the day pondering these things thinking about the goodness of God God you've been good to me and my family I just add my testimony to that brother Jo God you've been good to me and my family oh you you say you brought me out you kept me from so many things you've forgiven me of so many oh you've been good to me Abraham just rejoicing in his Spirit as he sits there in the door of the tent brother brandham then gives us a very interesting detail which is where I want to go today about these men that come these three men that come walking down the road toward Abraham and he tells us this he said he kept looking down to them he said now these are strange fellows they're Dusty they're Dusty traveled far and whenever you hear Brother bham tell this he tells it in dozens of places he always calls our attention to the detail of the Dust he said when the hour of the message came he looked out in the heat of the day he seen three men coming up dust all over their clothes and Abraham looked again he knew there was just something about it he said a real Born Again child of God knows the spirit of God when it strikes yes sir my sheep know my voice ELO him had dust on his clothes now when they brother BR said when they set him down there though they didn't look any different from any other men because they were dressed dust on their clothes and come from some other country probably their feet Dusty and their clothes ragged but Abraham knew inside there there was something real the spirit declared it he said why he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere all the time brother B says something wonderful here he says that he could recognize right from wrong all the time now sometimes I know uh when I deal with young people when you deal with young families I find that the reason they don't recognize right from wrong the reason they come to a pastor for counseling sometimes and they and they'll ask you can I do this and you're like what why would you ever think that would be okay adultery is never going to be okay smoking's never going to be okay drinking's never going to be okay even part-time it's never going to be okay but the reason they can't tell the difference between right from wrong is because they're not in a spiritual atmosphere and that's what brother BR said Abraham was in a spiritual atmosphere he could tell the difference listen to me young people you need to keep yourself in a spiritual atmosphere the reason why that you fell for that and you didn't understand that was wrong is you weren't in a spiritual atmosphere to begin with Netflix won't put you into that Call of Duty won't put you into that there's got to be something uh in your heart that desires the presence of God the power of God you need to be in a spiritual atmosphere not just on Sunday listen this is this our religion is not just about church the message didn't come just to make us a good church the message come that we could live the message we could be the message in our homes in our factories in our schools Tim said take my Liberty so I'm just preaching like I would at home so y'all y'all forgive me this morning I'm not an evangelist I God called me to be a pastor and I thank God for that cuz I'd have a tough time as an evangelist but but I'm so glad that God puts us where he needs us Abraham listen looks at them and he says brother BR says this about the dusty clothes over and over again now you might ask the question well how does brother brandham know their clothes are dusty well Abraham washed their feet right and they didn't wash their feet just as a honor or something like that because they had dirt on them right and it's really hard hard to get your feet dirty without your clothes being dirty they were dirty all over that's the I mean you can find a more Supernatural version if you want to but that's basically why now look and and brother Brown may have seen that I don't know but but there was there was dust on their feet and and somehow he recognized through that dust that this was God you you find the same thing happening when Jesus on the earth and he come down in a body of Flesh that looked like any other human being looked like any other looked like any other guy and yet he was sitting there he brother random tells us in one place he didn't look like a leader he wasn't tall and handsome and great he didn't look like a ceser he didn't look like a general he looked like just an ordinary Jew an ordinary man and he's sitting there but but and the and the Pharisees didn't recognize him and even the disciples sometimes struggled with it but here was a prostitute woman who never even thought about it before she never had any kind of an idea of who Jesus was but when she saw him brother B said she was attracted by the scent to Simon's house where he was sitting you remember the story she was attracted by the S of the lamb and when she gets up there what happens she begins to see him and when she saw saw him brother the Peter she saw there was something different about him she said this is not just an ordinary man this is him she saw through the dust on his clothes through the dust on his feet and said you know what I'm going to do I'm going to wash the dust off of his feet I'm going to get out and worship him I'm going to make him welcome Oh Glory to God oh it ought to be something we're all willing to do it ought to be something every one of us was willing to do to do a service for him brother BR said Noti she had a service to do for him she had heard of him now she seen him with her eyes she had a service to do and she had nothing to do it with so she rushed rushed forward anyhow to the service God furnished the water in towels to wash his feet Hallelujah where' the water come from from her eyes what was the tow her glory her hair she laid all of her glory down in his feet oh let me do that today if there's any Glory if there's any praise let me lay it down at his feet she had have heard of a Living God but now she's seen him with her eyes she knew it was him an inspiration struck and said this is the messenger he needed a service she had nothing to serve him by his feet was dirty but she rushed forward anyhow to do him a service because she was inspired to do it oh my something she'd never thought about something in her subconscious you know all of us can serve God consciously right we we can make our our El do it we can have faith consciously and that's good but when you serve him without thinking about it when you love people without thinking about it when you worship without thinking about it without a plan for it when it just happens it breaks out and you don't need music you don't need nothing you just you just start to worship God there's something happening in your Pew what is it you met him and and you didn't have anything to worship him with but he provided the things that you needed he's giving you your hands he's giving you your voice worship him when he comes but something in her subconscious realm compelled her to do it I think of the thief on the cross you remember I don't have time to go through all of this but it just comes to my mind today the thief on the cross was hanging there remember he was a type of Joseph in the Old Testament the Butler and the baker they both had a dream remember both had a dream and one of them was lost and one of them was saved neither one of them knew what the dream meant but the dream comes from the subconscious realm and they didn't know what it meant and on the thief on the cross he was hanging there and the one Thief said if you were the Christ you would come down off the cross and the other one not because he thought about it not because he prepared himself for it not because he was taught well brother brandom tells us he never had a thought about God before in his life listen to me you may be sitting here this morning and you've never had a conscious thought about God but I believe you're here today because somewhere in the subconscious realm somewhere in there there's a dream of your life a vision something that has to be expressed in your life this the oh Church the thief had a seed down on the inside there was something there that belonged to God he didn't even know about it he oh church he didn't have anything to do with it that's the way I got saved that's the way you'll get saved he didn't have nothing to do with it and God reached down where he was and said today you'll be with me in Paradise subconsciously that's the way it happened this the way Abraham recognized these men it's the way the The Prostitute recognized Jesus Oh My but the brand said the guests didn't know him they was ashamed of him because he was dirty he had dirt on his clothes he smelled bad that's the way it is today oh church I I come to you my heart's burden today because I want to I want to defend and not because it needs to be defended here because I know it has been many times but because it's in my heart I want to defend what God has done for us in our hour I want to defend the message of the hour it's it's still they put him off in the corner and put him in in a dirty place but I didn't when I receiv received the message of the hour it was more than a prophet it was more just a man but it was the word could come down in our age the Christ hitting Among Us and he come down not just in not just in mechanics but in Dynamics but the par said he is the Dynamics and he come down Among Us and they throw dirt on him yet he said they pile all the dirt they can upon it call it holy rollers and everything else they can think of nobody does nothing about it oh my there he sets Dirty Feet Wallflower at the party Wallflower in a religious meeting invited we ask him to come for a Revival when he comes we treat him the same way they did there he come and identify him something nobody wants nothing to do with him oh church I'm not trying to make you feel bad I don't want to move you just out of emotion but come on church can can you see him and we realize there's something we can do for Christ in our age we can worship him we can make sure that the church is open we can we can pay our tithes and our offerings we can we can go to the house of God with a cheerful heart and and give with the cheer and love people with all of our heart and not get caught up in all kinds of fights and fusses and squabbles we have a responsibility to that sir in my area I live an hour and a half from Jonesboro and Jonesboro Arkansas is where the great meetings were held BR said the greatest Miracles that ever took place aside from over he said we're right there in Jonesboro Arkansas God visited that place and I told our church I said we're responsible we are responsible we've heard too much preaching we've heard we've had too many things come by our way we're responsible we're responsible to present the right side to present the right thing to the people not to be some kind of a cold dead formal thing not to be some kind of a some kind of fanaticism but to be what God called us to be we're respons responsible to the message of the hour God done so much for us he' never have to do anything again to make you responsible some of you Elders know right here in shreport God did so much huh you're responsible remember capernium in the Bible I don't know why I'm going this direction but you remember capernium was was capernium was considered to be a place where Jesus did many of his mighty works it's where he lived for a while he resided in capernium and Jesus said it was worth worse than Sodom worse than Sodom CU what they turn down that's right I said God help us today as message people that we would not our punishment would not be worse than Sodom but that we would be the Bride of Jesus Christ we've heard it we're responsible to it I personally sat with people who were in the meetings and talk to them and know what happened and I've experienced against God for myself I am responsible our church is responsible I believe this church who's responsible we got to wash his feet that's right he came to Abraham notice he did not come as a Celestial being right he could have come with great big wings and a halo over his head and a great big sword and then anybody could have looked but Jonah said that's Elohim right but there were many times he maybe would have come in that way maybe he'd come in a different ways but then this time he chose to come as a Dusty traveler he had on clothes like a man dust all over him come from a far country but Abraham saw God face to face now again this wasn't just an angel this was God who created a body and come down Elohim we call him Elohim is the creator of all things the one who existed by himself and right Elohim the all powerful one dust on his clothes see it takes the faith of Abraham to see past the dust now it was not extraordinary that dust would be there in fact it was a very ordinary thing right it was it it would it would fit the narrative for there to be dust right if someone had come down and told Abraham now this is not who you think it is this is just a man they could have proved that scientifically by the dust right because they would have said well if he come from Heaven why is he Dusty that's a good question isn't it why is he Dusty if he come from heaven and some of y'all think about the message like that some people think about their pastors like that or preachers like that well if they come from Heaven huh if these are predestined officers of God why do they why are they human why can't they take my calls at 3:00 in the morning you know they probably will but why do they get grouchy sometimes come on church I'm putting off on us so you'll understand it's all of us right right but why do we get that way sometime why do we why do we struggle with those things God chose dust I don't know how he did that brother Tim he he he he he caused them to have dust on their clothes I don't know because all he did is make him himself a body I don't know if he made himself a body and then said now you angel you go over here you go over here and wormwood goes over here and Gabriel goes over here pick up some dust and throw it on me I don't know if they if they if they transferred to another dimension 20 miles away so they could get Dusty don't know how it happened all I know is somehow there was a human element on what they were wearing that appeared to be evidence that they weren't what they said they were everybody day is looking for evidence aren't they everybody says evidence or didn't happen they take brother Brand's quotes and try to use them against each other they take they try to set up websites and everything else and try to take the all kinds of different things and and try to make it this won't work against this and this against that hey you didn't have to tell Abraham that they were Dusty he knew they were Dusty he washed the dust off but he recognized oh church can we recognize underneath the dust there's an Elohim there's a God who's still able to meet our needs he was Dusty everyone's looking for that evidence of well of deity right but what they find is dust and they they they did the same thing to Jesus if you are who you say you are prove it and and the evidence showed he was just a man but he was God in flesh come on Church you better watch you say well if the evidence if the science shows I'll believe it well the science said a few years ago that if you went up faster than 30 m an hour you'd roll off the end of the Earth that's what science said science at one time said the Earth was flat and then they said it was round listen science says all kinds of things science got to learn science brought us Co I'll just drop that there you know that someone said that that Engineers built the Titanic amateurs built the ark right but it was amateurs who believe God's word who took God in his word who didn't care about the Dust they willing to look past the [Applause] dust I know my caller's out as a new shirt listen it was God hiding himself and Abraham calls out my Lord oh Church brother B said was the effect of the revelation of who God was oh Church you need to go back and listen to Jehovah Gyra and and some of these sermons brother Brandon preached about this he began to preach about he said that was the effect of the revelation of who God was of el Shai of the of the strong one of the almighty God the effect of that Revelation what it did to Abraham after his name was changed from Abram to Abraham he seen three men coming and he called the three one my Lord Hallelujah lot said my Lord he was a denominational believer but Abraham said my Lord why he saw past the dust and saw who it was Abraham's vision and Revelation showed him he was the all sufficient Elohim he said his seed is to receive the same thing said we're made out of 16 elements petroleum Cosmic light and potach and calcium and so forth Just 16 elements he just caught it together they had dust on their clothes but they were made out of dust right he just caught the dust together Hallelujah breathed into it and walked on the earth brother brand said I'm so glad he's that sort of a father aren't you glad he's that sort of a father today though the skin worms destroy this body yet he'll call you he promised to do it he's Zeo him I remember when I was very young I thought my dad could do anything he was that sort of father but as I got older I begin to see his humanity and I begin to realize he didn't you know and I got about 16 he didn't know anything and then got a little older and said realize he knew some things right just like all of you but you remember I don't know if you you can recall that feeling that Dad can do anything we all have that feeling about God he told Abraham he said is there anything too hard for God if you look up that word hard it's actually miraculous wonderful the word is wonderful wonderful is there anything too wonderful for God and we're told his name is wonderful Hallelujah if that's his name if you got a revelation of his name you should know who he is he's able to deliver from cancer he's able to deliver from diabetes he's able to heal heart trouble he's able to change a drunken man into a sober man he's able to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's able to to set up a church and and make it what it ought to be he's able to do all these things do you believe it this morning church he's able to do it he promised he'd do it said I'm so glad he's that sword of Father though the skin worms destroy this body yet he'll call you he promised to do it he's Elohim and Abraham after the Revelation he's seen it he knew there was one God and he seen he said my Lord come aside sit down let me wash your feet the message of a of a body change came from a messenger with dust on his clothes see God hides himself in dust our bodies are literally made from dirt brother BR said our bodies were on the earth before there was any life here we are made of 16 different elements of the earth he said that great Jehovah God he said he just reached over and got a handful of atoms got a little light and poured it in like this and went a body and just stepped right into it say come here Gabriel I know you've heard this before but just think about it now and think about it I just want you to think about it in the aspect of the Dust right that's what he used right he he said step into that God and two angels walk down there in human flesh drink the milk from a cow eat the butter out of the milk eat some cornbread boy it's good eating I had some cornbread yesterday that's good stuff God liked it so come on he ate what happened to those bodies now look when he leaves Abraham they just turn back to dust he drops the dust and he steps back into another dimension brother BR said that same one could just reach and grab a handful of calcium and poish and go and there you are again Hallelujah and my name is on his book oh aren't you glad for that today Hallelujah he said what do I care this ought to make us older folks feel good those of us who are getting older what do I care how stoop my shoulders are getting how old I get certainly not not a bit of worry he'll say children to God oh I'm looking forward to that one day I'm looking forward to the day when we see our loved ones again he said children there they are he's done it before glory to God if he did it for oh true if he did it for Abraham he'll do it for you and me He said there will be in his maid in his likeness Young Forever old ages passed away sickness troubl Sorrows has vanished glory be to the Living God we just don't need to get too discouraged by the dust it was dust on our prophet's clothes if we can say it that way we could understand I I thought of this the Lord's kind of spoke to me I was going through Jeffersonville in a dry time a year just earlier this year and and the Tabernacle I drove by it and there was dust all over the outside of the building and I was remembered again how small it was and how humble it was and how it looked like nothing was going to happen brother Brandon passed away it was just all over and today there's millions of people around the world who at least claim to believe the message how did that happen God stepped into dust I want you to understand I'm not just talking about a man talking about you are you with me now don't get discouraged by the dust brother Brandon was human he had a wife and children he worried about things he was nervous but God did more through that body than he had any other man up to that time brother BR say he saw more miracles in his ministry come on church we still believe that more miracles in his ministry than he did even when he was on the earth why because it was longer it was in more [Music] places right the same God but what went you out for to see Jesus said even this about John John was the Forerunner that's the type of of our Elijah he said yeah I S you more than a prophet he was dust yes but he was more than that amen look out there brother BR said he went out there Abraham went out there and said there's something about that man I've heard that voice before see when we heard the message we didn't just hear a man's voice I know people they try to make that literal voice the voice of God that's not what it is but you'd already heard a voice right the voice of predestination right spoke into your life and then when you heard the voice on the earth of God the word of God right you heard from your theophany you heard something that you you recognize you've heard it before we still believe those things he's got dust all over his clothes and things he brother B said he's sitting there rubbing his face B talked about how the anointing would get to where his face felt like leather and he'd rub his face he said he's sitting there rubbing his face looking around like that but I'm telling you I know that voice cuz it ain't an uncertain sound cuz I heard it 25 years ago and honey we've been trusted all this time to believe and there's something about that man I don't know why but there's something about him I believe when I come to this medicine church I've got every excuse in the world of just being open with you today to not believe this message I come through a a difficult message situation where it seemed like I had every excuse to leave and not believe it but when I heard the word I heard something I had heard before it struck something down in my heart I've had many discouragements so have you all of us maybe have a reason why we wouldn't be here why are you here today like Abraham something caught your attention beyond the dust beyond the humanity you saw God I stood at brother brandom's grave just a couple months ago and the body turned back to dust excuse me for being slow this morning but I'm just I'm fat I'm not as fat as I was but I'm fat praise God I mean there's no other way to say it I just got to be honest I stood there at the grave come on church it's dust Humanity but the one who used that body to reveal the secrets of the hearts wasn't in the grave the one who opened the Seven Seals to US Open the book the whole book was open to us we didn't even know what we believed till the book was open to us and the lamb that opened the book was not laying in the grave the dust is in the grave but not the one who Ed that dust church I don't know the Lord may come tomorrow he may come a hundred years from now but if it's a hundred years and we're still waiting these dust most of this dust will be gone but the the god that used it will still be here the brand said friends don't look to me I'm your brother don't pay no attention to me cuz I'm just Immortal I have to die like everybody else and this is an interesting statement he said don't you listen to me but listen to what I've said that kind seems almost contrary but it's true if you think about it don't just listen to me but listen to what I've said what I said is the message know don't just listen to it because it's me listen to the message don't pay any attention to the messenger watch the message keep your eyes not on the messenger but on the message what it said that's the thing to look to see he said it wasn't the angel his message was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the front of the son you all know this he said the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man you see God spoke through him in a way like he did to Moses like he did to Paul he was indicated numbers 126 hear now my words if there be a prophet among you how the Lord will make myself known to him in a vision speaking to him in a dream my servant Moses is not so who is faithful and on my house with him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently not in dark speeches and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold wherefore then were not afraid to speak against my servant Moses I tell you what people today are throwing a whole lot of dirt but they ought to be afraid to speak against God's messenger but again I don't want to limit that he had a he had a role to play but so do I so do you yes sir and I can't play his role I I they didn't choose me the director didn't choose me to play that actor to be that actor right I can't play the part of a of a word Prophet one to a generate he was one of one right one of one there's no there's nobody else that can play that role these brothers can't play we shouldn't triy to we we can't you can't expect us to right we can't play that role he he was limited edition you know why Beanie Babies are worthless today it's the way my brain works I'm sorry CU they made too many of them oh Church there was one prophet in this age one Prophet we're not waiting on another one he didn't have to have kids that were Pro are you with me now it didn't do that God it don't come on down through the family and we have another Prophet no the prophet was the prophet we had one in this age and he was one of one an extremely limited edition but so am I so am I nobody can take my place and nobody can take yours nobody can take brother Tim's place in this message are you with me now brother Tim's been a a rock in this message a fighter for nobody can take his place I don't want to brother Timothy don't want to we want to be what God calls us to be let's be Elohim revealed in dust that's why Prophet told us he said before Moses went into the land when the eny said other words I've spoken to you I'll call Heaven and Earth to witness against you if you add one word thing to it take one word from it you'll not stay in the land I want to stay in the land the land is the Holy Ghost I want to stay in the land the land of promise the land is the open word the open book are you with me now where all the blessings lay the land of the Holy Ghost amen all the blessings lay in the land he said so say I in the name of Jesus Christ don't you add one thing don't take put your own ideas in you just say what s on those tapes you just do exactly what the Lord God has commanded to do don't add to it a lot of people say well we'll just listen to the tapes then he also said just do exactly what the Lord God has commanded to do don't add to it he has ever kept his promise and he told us to preach are you with me now the Bible tells us to preach and brother BR Backle that cuz he was a word prophet ET he said he has ever keep his promise to us every promise that he's made he's kept it do you believe that today I know it's been heavy here for a few minutes can you just can you just lift that up with me for a moment he's kept his promise oh I'm grateful to him today he has kept we're here today because he's kept his promise I'm here to remind you he's still a promise keeper he still keeps his promise of healing he still keeps his promise of Salvation every promise someone say with me every promise that he has made he's kept it as he told you what would happen and didn't happen he said I bring heavens and earth before you today and a challenge as God ever said anything he's not fulfilled and done exactly what he said he would do for us hasn't he done it just the way he said he would do it that's exactly so will he continue to do it just don't add to it don't take from it just believe it and walk humble before the Lord your God for we're nearing the going in to the land I see when Abraham come I I'm not going to have time to get to all this today but when Abraham come he wanted them to feel welcome you've heard this many times before but just think about it now look who he was welcoming he wasn't welcoming God in a great big bunch of angels coming down saying I am Jehovah but he made welcome the Dust let a little water I pray you be fetched wash your feet rest yourselves under the tree and I'll fetch a morsel of bread and comfort your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant look at Abraham's attitude I just want to be a service I I just want to be a part listen that's my desire today and I probably told you before I preached it all over the world I want to be a servant I want to be I want to be like Simon that took Jesus cross and and walked that the road with him and he was just happen to be there there but he was pressed into service and when he did he he he just did what God told him to do and it changed his family history so that even every time brother Brandon mentions he mentions a a black family or a black person come up in the prayer line he said this is one of Simon's children and he remembered it all those years later cuz one man surrendered himself to be a servant Abraham fixed him a meal he didn't just fix any meal he said make ready quickly three measures a fine meal that's the meal reserved for Kings the best of the best I talking about tell about that earlier we ought to give him our best Church give me if that's your best that's all right I know you never smile but everybody else let's give him our best come on Church let's give him oh you said it's so difficult to smile but I think you can you can make it happen give him your best I know we go through things I know we have struggles I know it's real going through things right now but give him your best he didn't call us to be to be hot bed plants he didn't call us to just Ju Just serve him when the electricity was on but he said give him your best give it all that you've got every raise every ey every go every every bit of ounce of strength that I got let me give it to you Lord let me wash your feet let me give you the meal let me give you everything that I need I didn't plan in that but come on Church give him your best in the darkness give him the let him be the [Music] lightall Abraham ran to the herd and fetched an old stringy calf cow that was going to McDonald's to make a hamburger out of that's not what he did is it he ran to the herd and got the best calf a calf tender and good oh that's what I want the meal that I serve him to be tender and good I want the preaching that I preach and the things that I do to be good that's all I got church I don't I can't preach like some people but I want it to be good for him I want him to enjoy it man told me years ago his brother Daryl Ward I have a lot of respect for him he told me one time when I was 17 years old he said if you you may only be a 10-cent preacher I brought me down a peg he said but if you only give God a nickel you rob God of five cents give him your best he showed up as a Dusty Hungry Traveler and Abraham was hospitable to him Abraham knew his character now as far as we know this was his first time tasting human food look what he did it wouldn't be his last he the mid time was an opportunity for Fellowship he was hungry for fellowship and so Abraham stood there you remember what he did I don't have time to go into all of these little things but Abraham stood there with a fly bush you remember a fly bush it's a something you you sh the flies away with right pieces of paper or something you flew the you shoe the flies away with you know what sometimes deacons I see deacons moving around people walking around doing things what are they doing they hardly ever get anything out of a service that's just the truth it's difficult to be a deacon it's difficult to be a I want to stand up for you for a minute what are you doing you're you're you got a fly bush in your hand right everybody look at Michael he's walking around you got a fly bush in your hand what are you doing you're keeping the Flies off the meal you weren't called to preach but just stand there listen Church you got a fly bush in your hand you got hands you can worship him you got a voice you can say Amen to the word we got something we can do for God the almighty God Elohim invited himself over for a potluck I like that let's go down and see he invented that by the way I love it it's all right that's personal Doctrine it's okay oh church I wonder if he wants to come to our house wonder if he wants to come down to this church this morning said I know they got something good prepared down at evening light Tabernacle today I know the the song leaders been praying and the preachers been praying and the pastors been praying for the people and I know the people are ready to hear the the word I know there's a meal we're not just here to get something we're here to feed Elohim give him a drink that he desires of Pentecostal Waters I wonder if he wants to come to our house he said well he's never invited himself over to my house yes he has he said behold I stand at the door and knock remember he was put outside the age but not outside the bride he was put outside the age said If any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come into him and we'll Su with him Su means the evening meal It Don't Mean a quick lunch break but the evening meal Abraham fixed the angel an evening meal in the middle of the day there's a significance to that he went out of his way to provide a meal for him are you tired yet I well I just got a little bit more I am a prit someone said you can do it and [Laughter] can he sat down with his disciples like he did Abraham he said unto them with desire have I desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say to you I will not anym eat thereof until it be fulfilled what was it there was a hunger in the heart of Elohim he wanted to come down and fellowship what was the meal an excuse for Fellowship what is this service and excuse for fellowship if I can put it that way God Elohim wanted to come down and fellowship with you and you haven't had time to talk to him lately and he said I want to meet you in the service I want to be there when the meal's prepared and I want to talk to you for a minute with desire have I Desir to be whole church he wanted to be here today the same day he rose he made himself another body and he ate dinner with two of them again the road to Emmas and you know the story there how he talked to him along the way he looked at them sadly started to walk on by oh church but he was waiting for them to invite him in that's what he's waiting tonight for you to invite him in they recognize him because they had fellowship with him before I have fellowship with him I fellowship with him in the word and in the spirit one day I'll see him face to face I long for that I don't mind to tell you I'm looking looking forward I brother B how exactly is that going to be I don't know and I don't care I just want to be there he said blessed are those but there who are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God he said I do believe when the bride is called out and elected and said in the Book of Life there will come a sound from heaven will take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that'll take her from the earth and a rapturing Grace do you believe that church there is a heaven and there's a literal Jesus Christ there that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth it's still the truth in 2024 again brother Bron said now if I never see you again remember the marriage supper is at hand so after the meal they began to talk they said where is Sarah thy wife and he said in the tent he called her by Sarah her princess name he Saidi will certainly Return To Thee according to time of life and lo Sarah th why I have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him behind him now God did something in our day and I want to just show you what he did because it give you confidence because you know he's here right I think we need to be reminded sometimes what we're fighting for what we're doing here God did something in our day and he continues to do it but there were many promises fulfilled through a messenger and in his message and in uh in the the the gifts and the signs that God placed in his life there were things that were done specific there that showed us where we're at right showed us right where we're at so Elohim come down now he borrowed a redeemed body I heard someone say and it's true it proved Calvary worked CU this time he didn't have to blow into a body of dust and come down and be with us but he borrowed a redeemed body just like he wants to borrow your body this morning not not to do what brother brandham did that that was a specific sign again but to manifest the part you've been called to do so it's the son of man not manifesting himself as a preacher or or as one of the nine spiritual gifts but as a son of man uh as the son of man revealing himself through a son of man even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed brother brand did that and he specifically turned his back to the audience to show them such a simple thing but was telling him something God's doing it again and he told him he said each night I've been turning my back to the you'll find around 1960 brother R starts doing this he said I've turned my back to the audience that you might know Hallelujah as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man again just that you might know I'm going to turn my back to the audience now remember he said when I do this don't let me get L saying brother brandham you called yourself that angel that's wrong I'm a sinner Saved By The Grace Of Christ no matter what I did no matter how much God anointed me he said if you wasn't anointed also it wouldn't work it's your faith that does it he said this is just a gift just to pull a lever back far enough again whatever's in you is going to come out if you can pull the lever back far enough to let William brandom step off the scene so Jesus Christ can work now you pull your lever back far enough you can get off the scene Jesus Christ can work that's how he works through a preacher that's how he works through a Sunday school teacher that's how he works through every one of us I'm hurrying now to finish but it's important you go back Jehovah Gyra number two in 1960 among other places brother brandham keeps attempting to turn his back to the audience and they didn't understand what was going on but finally he gets through to him and he gets his chance and he turns his back and there's someone said there's someone standing before me sits behind me oh my you know it's interesting because it's hard to preach with your back turned do you know that you get nervous I think some of you y'all feel the same way I do not like preaching with my back to the audience CU you can't see what people are doing but he did right someone is standing before me which sits behind me and it's a woman and She's suffering with a heart trouble and she has allergies that's bothering her she's just behind me she's also concerned about a loved one her husband that's sitting just frommer he's paralyzed has a cane he didn't see the cane he was turned around said the woman's name is Mrs Brumley believe with all your heart stand up and accept what you prayed for you'll get what you asked for he said if that ain't the same God it was down there just before Sodom I don't know what is this day this scripture was fulfilled but you know brother bam told us we have something more than that do you know that and I'm not doing away with the vision or visions what I'm just saying is there was something more he said the word was greater right I don't mean you do away with anything else but it just means you believe differently are you with me now you still want to be prayed for you still want I believe in prayer lines I believe in hands laid on you but you believe differently you're not a widow you're not you're not crying out and it's in the story of the unjust judge and the Widow it was a widow woman with no claims on an inheritance and an unjust judge that just gave it to because she came for it but he said even if the Widow could get what she but but she got she got it by crying he said that's God's way of getting something but that's not what we are we are not a widow we cry and when we cry we are a bride where is bride hallelujah oh church we should come in faith the prayer line whatever that it is that we come through if you come up for prayer this morning or whatever whenever that it is whenever you come you come believing that you got something better even better than what was here when brother Brandon was alive I hope you're hearing me but he preached the word to us he said that's God speaking in this day through vision but this if that Vision was contrary to this that would be wrong he said this is more than the vision if any Visions contrary to the word leave it alone it ain't of God God don't contradict his own word let me say this if an open Vision could show the sign of a messiah and prove to an age that the same God that was in Sodom was right there why would the open book do come on Church what would the open book do the open book would reveal to us who we are so we are not children anymore just begging for a scrap of bread we are the Bride of Jesus Christ brother brand said the third poll was the opening of the word he said was far greater than the rest of them combined body went back to the dust but the son of man is still here do you believe that today we're not waiting on a prophet to rise up God's not going to call that body up and then speak to us again we don't need it what are we waiting on one of these mornings oh church but while we wait Hallelujah I don't I don't even know how to finish this but see brother brandom taught us that there would come a time would Express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in this church the anointed man now the anointed people to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed accepting what he brother Bram was just a part of that anointed bride but you're part of that anointed bride do you believe that today and he say what do we need to do to be anointed preach the anointed word the word of the hour preach the word live the word believe the word the word said they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover live the word believe the word brother B said the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down come in human flesh unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together to do that it'll take the manifestation of the son of man the son of man when the word here unites with the person and they Two Become One what does it do them manifest the son of man again not church theologians I said no we don't need Church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing brother BR said Jesus was God in flesh if Jesus is in you tonight how many believe Jesus is in you well if if I didn't I'd be seeking the Holy Ghost that's how Jesus gets in us it's by the token the power the true baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus in us the literal life of Jesus Christ but he said if Jesus is in you it's still God do you believe that church manifesting himself oh I don't I don't even have much much strength left to preach but I want you to understand that the son of man is revealing himself in his church I'm reading the words of a prophet the human flesh making himself known God down in here in his church making himself again the word the son of man being revealed in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom it was not limited to just a prophet but the son of man wants to reveal himself through you not through his gift but through your gift gift whatever it is that God's called you to do I challenge you to believe it that's what a prophet told us he said I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body accept his call will you accept it today I challenge you to believe that she under her Messenger will be the final voice to the final AG what do we believeing we're believing what God Said I challenge you to believe and that day you'll know that I'm in the father the father and me I and you and you and me he said hallelujah we're here we're here hallelujah I'm so glad to see him personifying himself right Among Us and see what he promised for the word he said not just what somebody's emotion singing jumping and dancing but by his word he's making himself known listen they took the ark down twice the first time they had singing and dancing but not but they didn't do it by the word but the second time they also had singing and dancing I'm so glad God hadn't taken that away from us but what is it the pillar of fire is leading the way are you with me now the word is leading the way cuz the word is alive the pillar of fire brother BR said led the ark into its resting place when it was done right I believe it's LED it into your hearts today in closing musicians go ahead and come see I just couldn't do it you know brother look he's here this morning do we really believe that see do we really believe that CU I think if he come by your house or if he come by your Pew how would you feel if you come by and you just sit down right here just sit down what would you think like how would you treat him right come on Church he'd be right there I I know this if you were a sinner you'd repent would never have to make an altar call they'd come what if he was sitting right here he is see he's not right here he's right here he's right here Among Us he said you said he's in you it means he's right here what if the pillar of fire was visible right by your seat imagine the what you talk about having a song service you started to sing down from his glory and here come a visible Pillar of Fire and begin to move you think you wouldn't run and Shout well you need to see with eyes of Faith you need to see who's here today you need to see him

meantime Elisha the type of the Bride M Mr Jesus and Mrs Jesus you've heard it all before but Elisha the type of the Bride got a double portion of his Spirit remember but the Chariot of Fire H to the bushes what's keeping the Rapture from going at the right time brother Brandon said we seen The Chariot of fire it's a remarkable quote we have seen the Chariot of fire that lifted him up out of the grave now he said something even more remarkable he said we feel it among us now what you feel this morning what those tears that been running down that's not just emotion see we believe in more than
