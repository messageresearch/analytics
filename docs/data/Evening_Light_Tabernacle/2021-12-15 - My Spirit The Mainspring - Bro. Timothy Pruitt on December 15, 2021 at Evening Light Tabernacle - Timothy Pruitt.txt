asked lord tonight that you would come and touch our hearts and lives meet your people lord in a special way lord just i commit myself to you for your glory in jesus name amen amen let's turn to ezekiel chapter 36. i had something i was planning on preaching as of this week and but this this chapter here is just so maybe we'll move it on to next wednesday but this chapter's just been rolling through me and i've tried to find a place to just break into it somewhere and and uh it wouldn't be quite as lengthy but i'm gonna have to read the whole chapter amen ezekiel 36 and verse one it says also thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of israel and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god because the enemy has said against you aha even the ancient high places are ours in possession therefore prophesy and say thus saith the lord god because they have made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side that you might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen and you were taken up in the lips of the talkers and our infamy of the people therefore you mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers to the valleys to the desolate wastes to the cities that are forsaken that was forsaken which become a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about therefore thus saith the lord god surely in the fire of my jealousy have i spoken against the residue of the heathen and against idomia which i have which have appointed my land unto the possession with the joy of all their heart with despiteful minds to cast it out for a prey prophesy their concern in the land of israel and say unto the mountains to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys thus saith the lord god behold i have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury because you have borne the shame of the heathen therefore saith the lord god have lifted up my hand surely the heathen thereabout you they shall bear their shame but ye o mountains of israel you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people of israel for they are at hand to come and behold i am for you and i will turn unto you and you shall be tilled and sown and i will multiply men upon you all the howls of israel and even all of it in the cities which be shall be inhabited and the waste shall be builded and i will multiply upon you man and beast and they shall increase and bring forth fruit and i will settle you after your old estates and will do better unto you than at your beginnings and you shall know that i am the lord yea i will i will cause men to walk upon you even my people israel and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men thus saith the lord god because they say unto you thou land devourst up men and has bereaved thy nations therefore thou shalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nations any more saith the lord god neither will i cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more neither shall th shalt thou bear reproach of the people anymore neither shout thou cause thy nations to fall anymore saith the lord god moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man when the house of israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as an uncleanness of a removed woman wherefore i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it and i scattered them among the heathen and they were dispersed through the countries according to their way according to their doings i judged them and when they entered into the heathen whether they went they profaned my holy name when they said unto them these are the people of the lord and are going forth out of his land but i had pity for my holy name which the house of israel had profaned among the heathen whether they went therefore saying to the house of israel thus saith the lord god i do not this for your sakes o house of israel but from my holy name's sake which you have profaned among the heathen whether you went and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which you have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be satisfied in you before their eyes for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you all out of all the countries and will bring you into your own land and i will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell on the land that i gave your fathers and you shall be my people and i will be your god i will also save you from all your uncleanness i will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you i will multiply the fruit of the tree increase of the field and you shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen then shall we remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations not for your sakes do i do this saith the lord god be it known unto you and be ashamed and confounded for your own ways o house of israel thus saith the lord god and the day that i shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities i will also cause you to dwell in cities and ways shall be built and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas whereas to lay desolate in the sight of all that pass by and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the garden of eden and the wastes and the desolate and ruined cities or become fenced are inhabited then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i the lord built the rune places and planted that which was desolate and i the lord has spoken it and i will do it thus saith the lord god i will yet for this be inquired of by the house of israel to do it for them i will increase them with men like a flock as the holy flock as the flock of jerusalem and their solemn feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and they shall know that i am the lord amen so many wonderful things in that scripture you can be seated oh i'd like to speak to you tonight i had a very difficult time finding the title for this because there's so many things to to be able to go in so many directions but i'd like to speak to you on his spirit the main spring his spirit the mainspring and we've been reading about the land of israel and how that how that had become a very desolate place and we we've witnessed that actually in our generation here in the last within the last 100 years or so of how a desolate land would begin to bloom again and a people would come back to that land but you know god's not only interested in a physical land and a physical people he also has a spiritual people and a spiritual land amen and so he his word is there and it will not return into him void and brother branham would pick up about ezekiel and he would say ezekiel was prophesying or he was foretelling what would take place in the age to come not in his age but an age to come he said you know god likens his prophets to eagles that would go in the makeup of a prophet he's a seer and in the spirit he climbs beyond the emotion of the church it goes beyond the rhythm of the music he goes beyond the clapping of the hands he goes beyond the joy among the saints he goes beyond all of that and god brings him to a realm alone then he opens his eyes and he lets him look around and see things that are to come now it might be five minutes five years five months or 50 years or thousands of years but he allows him to see things to come then he brings him back down among the members of his body to be able to foretell of them what is in the making see he said the word of god has been spoken before the foundation of the world it isn't that god speaks and says something to a prophet at that time it's at that time the prophet catches what god has already said and what god has already said god's word will be fulfilled and we've seen as we read that it's very clear that we can look at it in our day and we can see mountains that were desolate lands that were destroyed that are now you know uh has gardens and now has vineyards and and now has a multitude of people upon it and we can see how god how they went into the heathens and went into the other lands and how god began to draw them back to himself and bring them into this place and we can see god's word being fulfilled in our time he says for the word was before the foundation of the world god spoke the word and it's laying way out there stretched out into time and the prophet goes up and sees that time coming so it's a gift of knowledge or a gift of prophecy that he grabs a hold of what's coming and he puts it upon paper and ezekiel the prophet goes out and sees the day that we're living in well he said oh what a trip he took up jacob's ladder to foresee what will be and he brings it back down he puts it on paper and now in the last 2000 years which you know ezekiel lived some 600 to 800 years before christ you know and he begins he says he said they had a stony heart and then the holy ghost could not enter into that heart had no way of entering to their heart because it was a sinful heart it was a stony heart and he said so there had to be a place in time that would come to where the atonement of blood not the atonement of the blood of an animal or or a sheep or a lamb or a goat but the atonement of a blood that was co-equal with a human that could come upon a human's life and so amen zika would actually pick up i'll put a new heart in you i'll put a new spirit in you i'll put my spirit in here that could not happen in the day that ezekiel was living in but it only could happen when the blood sacrifice of the lamb of god would come into time because it already been spoken amen and this word was stretching out into time to where it could be fulfilled and be brought to pass amen and to where now that where that our people could receive a new heart of flesh a new spirit and his spirit amen and so because we know the animal life it has no soul in it so it's like mixing oil and water together don't mix so christ had to come and the blood of christ which was shed at calvary inside that blood cell they knoweth nothing other than the life of god and the worshiper comes before god with this appropriate blood appropriated it is the blood of the redeemer that redeemed us now adam put us in the pawn shop but the blood of christ brought us back out of the pawn shop and he's your redeemer and now you belong to christ through the blood of jesus christ amen it's only in the time that that we now live in now that the heart can be changed it can be given a new heart a heart to believe a heart to receive a heart to understand man we see we you know jesus would even say to the pharisees oh you slow of heart you know slow to understand you're you're seeing things being fulfilled in scripture but you're not seeing them because you have a stony heart but you have to receive a heart that can believe a heart that can receive something from god now you know in in in doing so you become his by his spirit amen so we see and this quote right here just about sent me through the roof he said see and in doing so god gave you to christ as a love gift for his sacrifice and you are brought to christ by the holy spirit who wounds you who wounds you through the blood of the lord jesus to present to him as a gift and god loves his gifts and he will not stand to see them destroyed oh hallelujah amen that gives me great confidence in the time that i'm living in he's wooed me amen he's gave me a heart of flesh he gave me a heart to believe he's he's placed a new spirit in me he's given me his spirit and i've been presented to him as a love gift amen is a love gift and he will he loves his gifts i'm not talking about just the gift of singing and the gift of preaching and he loves his gifts amen his blood bought saints of almighty god has been bought by the blood of the lamb and been placed in this time he loves you hallelujah and because he loves you he will not stand and see you destroyed hallelujah well the destroyer is in the land this destroyer amen the pill horse rider is about to ride and we see things begin to take place as his ride is coming very imminent amen as he starts it and we see it all taking place but the destroyer is in the land but you'll not be destroyed amen because he is here and he loves you well i can't get past that this evening amen you know we need to realize and really think about how god amen has brought you in this time that you're living in and it be his spirit begin to woo over your body begin to wool over your soul and begin to wow over your life and satan had come and it brought every kind of sin upon you and covered you up as it would be concrete over a grass seed but the spirit of god began to draw you it began to woo you it began to call you it began to pull on you amen you was a drunkard you was this you was that but there was something on the inside said this is not who you're supposed to be what was it it was god bringing his love gifts he had seeds there he said one fellow asked another fellow one day said do you believe if a man wants a child of god born of the spirit of god washed in the blood and redeemed thoroughly by god by the renewing of his heart by the washing of the water by the blood through the word and becomes a child of god don't you think that person could sin and get away from god to where he would be lost this man said i'll answer your question when you answer mine do you think that a man can be so good that he could lie still do anything bad but he would be so good that god would receive him into heaven without the blood of christ no then if that's no the others know amen amen you can't be so good that you're going to make it it ain't because you was born in a certain family or are born in the south i'm talking about earthly family prince family uh ledale family whatever family you want to be amen adam's family always be family whatever family that's not what gave you the the ability to be his gift what give you if god gives you the right to be his gift is god put a seed on the inside of you and he began to call upon you and it began to woo upon you amen and you begin to give love back to him amen he says see no of course not you could not go to heaven without the blood of the lord jesus no matter how good you are that would be self-made righteousness no matter how good you are it's totally impossible for you to get to heaven on your goodness so let's put our goodness on a tree somewhere it's the mercy of god that brought you at calvary hallelujah it's the mercy of god that bought you at calvary and you were god's love gift to christ and if god gave a gift to christ christ keeps his gift so not only is he going to make sure you're not going to be restored destroyed he keeps you that's why he would say when he all that comes to me and all the father has given me will come and none of them will be lost but i'll raise them up in the last days so he's not brought you to this place to watch you up in the trash and throw you away but he keeps his gift [Applause] listen i understand how it is we live in a land of you know especially compared to other worlds amen are plenty and you get gifts for christmas and you might like it it's a new toy and you know it's the greatest thing and and since sliced bread your mama or daddy fought through every kind of thing to find it for you because you just had to have it and you got this gift and you played with it for a few days and the next thing it's an old hat don't matter no more it stays in the closet finally your mom gets tired of looking at it and she puts it in a yard sale and she gets rid of it and one day you loved it and the next day you don't may take months it may take years amen but you you have those things amen every one of us does amen amen that's not the way god is with his gifts [Music] he didn't receive you one day and down the road decided i don't want you no more he didn't receive you at one time and say you know what i've changed my mind about you i'm putting you back in the pawn shop no sir if he had you in his mind and you was his gift given to him for his sacrifice you will always be his gift he keeps his gifts hallelujah now he said you know you said brother brown will say it like this you might be emotionally worked up you might have all through your hands speak with tongues dance in the spirit join the church some of the other things fantastics of today you know and you could be lost have all of that be lost but if your love god's love gift to christ you are safe if you are god's love gift to christ you are safe your life will prove who you are by their fruits you shall know it if you're trying to make yourself act sweet make yourself be humble you're still outside the kingdom it's not your own works he said that's where the church is the people so-called the church has failed so miserably because it's their own personal work that they feel that they met by their own personal work they feel they merit the goodness and the grace of god but what they do and how they live that's not one thing to do with it it is the gift of god your own conscience to shun you from hell would try to make you uh your which that would you would shun from hell rather will try to make you live good and be right and be a good citizen you know there's good citizens as not actually not necessarily christians i've seen people who called themselves christians wasn't good citizens amen but also it's a flip-flop you know a good christian a good citizen is not necessarily a christian might be a good person might have some good morals might have some good things he said i've seen many people who's even denied the name of the lord jesus we're fine people oh it's humanly speaking look how much more better was a man esau than jacob but he didn't have the conception to know that he's when he sold his birthright he despised it and when he sold it he was despised and rejected of god but he was far more gentleman a neighbor a man of works than what jacob was jacob was a deceiver he was a planner he deceived people but he saw a gentleman in every respect but jacob had recompense or he had a respect to the birthright he wanted the birthright more than he wanted anything else that's pretty much the calling card for who a real christian is somebody who wants to birth right more than anything else somebody that wants the birthright more than their closet to be the new thing somebody wants to birthright more than their outward appearance to be the up the ups and this and that and the other they want god more than anything amen or they call him a holy roller and fanatic whatever they wish to but he had respect to the birthright that was his whole motive that was his whole wants that whatever it cost him he wanted the birthright but he said you know many people he said if the body of christ was controlled by intellectuals or theology or mental conceptions then we're wholly dependent upon the intellectual knowledge of man he said if the church only rests upon the intellectual upon your abilities that's what the intellectual is upon your abilities and what you think and you know we built this great thing and flushed seats and thousand dollar pipe organs and and how he could preach his message in such a way that would get people to church and join a church and more members on the book he said i want you to get this and never let it slip so that sounds something pretty important if we only need the intellectual conception of man we don't need the holy ghost said if the church is to be run and governor about governed upon intellects and educational programs and upon the intellects of a man of mankind we do not need the holy spirit but if it's to be run by the holy spirit we don't need the intellectuals [Music] that's the prophet of god's words it's either one or the other amen oh my amen so we got to have something on the inside a mainspring amen see the smarter the man would be the more intellectual he's had the more schooling he got the better grammar he would be the better off the people are the better off the church is if he can present the program and say well they said what is that he said that is nothing but mental emotion he said if we can present the program and say now we'll build a great church we'll call it a certain name we'll attract the attention of the people all through the city when we play chimes every sunday morning on our spire we'll attract the attention of the poor lost center in the gutter when he sees we wear better clothes and when we offer him food and we offer him this and we wear nice hats we'll present this to the people and and see what and we'll show them the desires of of what a woman ought to be in a man how nice we ought to wear and how suits ought to be just right our dresses ought to be our cars ought to be great what we ride in how we stand in social abilities and and the city and and you know we're able to bring this one in and bring that he said if that's god's program they're right he said but jesus never quoted it that way he said if i be lifted up not the church not what we can do not our abilities but if christ can be lifted up he said so through the whole world educational program he said it's all right if you don't he said that's all right if you don't leave this house he said but man is not drawn to christ by intellectuals or by theology the holy spirit alone is god's drawing power [Applause] oh hallelujah amen you know it's not the dre it's not there be people get a man i i met somebody just up there when he was built was looking to build that uh gymnasium out there the you know for the youth youth building there and uh we went up to spring hill and was talking with the because the builder had sent us up there to look at a building he had built previously and she's like well what what what do you need one of those for you got young people i said yeah we got your own people she said well how many you have and i said uh probably enough about 40 to 60 or so and then several several about the same in sunday school and and more coming and she just kind of looked at me with a wild eye and stare it's like what are you doing to get those young people there she said we've tried everything you know i i i'll say this brother josh bennett you know was in in the middle of uh building starting to build a church and he had to be in a gymnasium because they've you know through you know it's amazing through covert his church has outgrown his church so he had to move to a gymnasium and they'd been renting this gymnasium from a wesleyan methodist church and and they all of a sudden on sundays they saw this gymnasium full of people two three four hundred people i don't know it was full of folks and and and brother josh was hoping maybe that they would sell the place to him because they'd only had a few members and then and and so he went and approached him and said look we'd like to buy this if y'all if y'all want to sell it they said oh no we see what you're doing we're going to get us a young preacher and we're going to we're going to have it in that gymnasium and we're going to get our music program right so we'll be able to have church like that they're missing the whole point it ain't the preacher it's christ [Applause] amen it ain't the building it's christ for months that gymnasium said empty and was growing cobwebs but you get christ in there you get god moving in there in the spirit of god he said i will draw all men unto me listen we don't have young people because we got a program or even because we got a place for them to play some basketball we have young people because there's families and pastors and preachers that preach jesus christ and they lift him up out of history and say he's not a god of the past but he can be your god too he's not just your daddy's god but he can be your god too he can change your life just like he changed him pruitt he can change every life in here it's not a program it's christ the holy spirit alone is god's drawing power he said see it's the scripture he that exalts himself shall be a base he that humbles himself that'll be exalted he said they got that upside down they're trying to get men into a church by intellectual speeches he said we do not need intellectual speeches there's a prophet of god we don't need intellectual speeches but it's the baptism of the holy spirit with power and demonstrations and manifestations of the spirit that is what we need to bring men to the church it is the drawing unction of the holy spirit he said schools and seminaries are fine have nothing against them but that's not god's program amen god chose the ignorant and the illiterate man who couldn't speak well there was plenty of people that had education he could have got there had been plenty that had a doctrine of divinity and pharisees he could have pulled from but he pulled from a poor fisherman couldn't hardly write their name if they could at all amen he pulled from the illiterate they couldn't speak they couldn't read and the bible said they were ignorant and unlearned but they had been for to a far better school for when they healed a man at the gate called beautiful they took the knowledge they learned at that school up on the up in the upper room that they had been with jesus and people around them had to realize and take knowledge these men had been with jesus because they're doing exactly what jesus did and people want to say they've been with jesus and they don't believe in healings and they don't believe in deliverances and they don't believe in salvation anymore and they don't believe they say days of miracles are past you ain't been with jesus you've been in the intellectual realms explaining all the way the same intellectual realms the serpent operated out of said this be an intellectual type of the churches that we have today in america and all over the world we get to that type of school then the christian the believer the church may be reading the bible sees he must try to act humble he must try to be this way he said what they do is they begin to become carnal impersonations he said let that soak deep a carnal comparison trying to act something that he really isn't in his heart in his heart he's thinking in one way and is trying to act another he said in genuine language that's a hypocrite jesus said you hypocrites how can you speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart speaketh the mouth the heart the mouth speaketh if you don't speak according to what's in your heart your heart thinks one thing and you speak another that makes you a hypocrite i mean the very word pharisee means actor they acted out their religion but they had a stony heart they acted out that they believed it but inside they really didn't they came to jesus said good master we'd like to see a sign well just how many signs do you need he doesn't raise the dead he didn't open the blind to the eyes of the blood even a blind man saw him and jesus would say how can you call me good there's none good but god said the weak and the adulterous generation seeks for a sign but there'll be a sign given as jonah was in the belly of the well three days and night so the son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights and they saw that fulfilled and still couldn't figure it out with their intellectual ideas still tried to explain it all away say it didn't happen that was just a made-up story by some guards because they didn't want to lose their life the disciples come and stole the body away he still they wouldn't put him somewhere else intellectual ideas and of course if they they would have had youtube back there that had all their videos on about the end too about how this ain't so and how that ain't so and i got this figured out and i got that figured out and you wasn't even there if you'd have been there you'd have saw the angel come down and the stone rolled away and the guards fall as dead people and a man who'd been in the grave three nights amen well three days walk out that's what really irritates me about these these youtube wannabe peoples whatever you want to call them i don't know what you want to call them heretics is what they are blasphemers bound for hell is what they are they get up and they want to say what happened back in the 60s and the 50s and what didn't happen and line it all up and have it all figured out and they got it all and it wasn't even there and they want me to believe you again you wasn't even there i mean let's go out here and let's go to this witness you know hear a big crash out there and you know i just sorry brother and i used brother aaron he's good at putting words together telling stories he wouldn't hear a big crash and he runs out there and he tells the cop well this car was coming this way and this car was coming this way and this one swerved over here and that one come over there and bam they hit right there it was this person's fault and he wasn't there it's no different than what they're doing on youtube videos well they did this and that happened over here and they're they're putting their own intellectual ideas into it and expecting me to believe it but i got a different heart they try to place this new program this new deal god has with the church that was presented to pentecost not an intellectual at all when intellectualism at all it was 120 fishermen tent makers and housewives housewives went up into the upper room and waited until god's prophecy was fulfilled and they received the baptism of the holy ghost jesus told them stop you preaching don't go any further don't do any more go up and wait in the city called jerusalem until you endue with power from on high not to you receive your ba or your daddy or your phd or your psychology degree you can you become an intellectual teacher but wait until you get your diploma amen not wait until but not wait until you get a degree but wait until you endure with power from on high not from a school but from on high then you shall be my witnesses in jerusalem and judea and samaria to the uttermost parts of the earth his last commission to all the world preached the gospel and we want to change it we get icicles and put them in the pulpit and they give a little intellectual speech and you're supposed to receive it by receiving it you receive the baptism of the holy ghost that's not how they did it on the day of pentecost on the day of pentecost it was the rushing mighty wind it was a wooing of the holy ghost upon lives and seeds that were sitting there amen until fire could fall upon a seed and it burst into life it wasn't given by peter giving an intellectual speech it was given by the power of the holy ghost and in my name you'll cast out devils and speak with new tongues you drink any deadly tank or take up a serpent it won't harm you and they shall lay hands upon the sick they shall recover that was to be the sign of the believer that was to be the sign of the believer instead of educated intellectualism amen now god was going to make a new church so he's going to put a new heart in there and a new spirit in there he wasn't just going to give it a facelift and it'd be the same old church no it wasn't going to be a hot the old heart just polished up it's going to be a new heart i'm going to take that old stoney heart away but i'm going to put a new heart in there he said what was it it was an act of grace it was god placing something inside of there to be able to receive something from him amen so i'll take the old heart out i'll put the flesh your heart in you say see he said he would do that you can't put that in an old intellectual church and he said that's the reason why america is in the condition you won't know why america's in the condition is today because it's been calloused with an old intellectual idea that's the reason that is go forth and every person signs papers and because they are now a member of a certain church and so forth for a little hollywood revival that's coming and all them come out with glamour girls and boys and put out their little programs and when they leave they go back and find out about 90 of that accepted christ as savior they're not there anymore what's the matter it wasn't a revival it was an intellectual illusion mercy it only presented something as the american people would clap their hands and ho and the hollywood television articles would come out and the pulpit you know had been replaced by a hollywood fashion box and when the old-fashioned gospel preacher used to drink wash sister and water and preach all night by lamp light it's changed but we changed it and that's why we got the intellectual group that we got now because we have changed what was given to the original church and that's how and he said that's how you're ever are you ever in the place where every home is now televised with who loves lucy and all these other ungodly programs over the air and television such that how we ever going to present this new gospel the way that christ told us to do and to such as that if the mind still remains carnal it'll run through fantastics and fanaticism it'll bypass the word of god and run off in oil droppings and everything he said how are you going to stop it the bible said it would be that way and god said it would be that way the intellectual the whole lady they give her you know they give her a facelift but she's still the same old woman hey old man they give him a facelift but he's still just the same old man oh i'll turn a new page i'll i'll start a new life i'll throw away my pipe i'll throw away my beer i'll clean out my refrigerator but still the same old man and years later go right back to it why because they never received him oh sure they'll get up behind it and say well i always had it and i never you know a person can fall make all their excuses in the world but they never had it in the first place it ain't a face lifting we're not interested in giving you a facelift we're not interested i i i this group is one of the only groups left so it's a reason why i use them we're not interested in making you like a mennonite or amish because you have a certain dress and you you do a certain thing and and you i'm a message believer that's not a life that's a lifestyle hey i know i it don't work i was just telling somebody other than the paris family the other night me and sister ruth was on a cruise here if our only cruise we've ever been on brother george sister trish we decided to go on an excursion we wanted this horse ride out into the out into the uh uh plantation but i think it was a banana plantation and then i was going to take a ride in the ocean on the horses really really really interesting in jamaica when we first got on the boat we noticed this amish couple that was walking around and would you know it we got on the bus to go to our excursion and right in front of us on the seat in front of us was this amish couple of course that puts my wife's radars out because she can understand what they're saying and she finally says something to them and they do it scared them to death and so if we go on this horse ride they move away from us they don't have nothing to do with us they don't want to be around us and they go on going about their business and we go on this horse ride ride through this plantation along the coastline come back around they change the saddles out and they say all right we're going to go in the ocean listen these two amish people went into some changing rooms and there wasn't ever every anomaly person come out shorts bikinis the whole 109 work nine yards they came out after the horse ride they went there two people went back in and amish people came back out listen we're not interested in that we're not interested walking in here and you're you're a message believer and you're going out and you're not this ain't a changing room that you can just drop clothes and put on clothes and drop ideas and put on ideas this is a birthing room it's going to change your life forever listen you're walking here amen a loss dying center going to hell and god's word will come across your path and ignite something in your heart he'll say i believe it that's the word of god and the spirit of god fall on you and you'll walk out like never before never to be the same again [Applause] listen again they got into baptists too they can go and dress up on a day on a sunday or on especially easter listen we're not interested in that that's a facelift it just it's just painting an old if i could say it like this an old barn you just paint it up and it looks all pretty but inside it's ate up by termites it's ate up and boards are decaying and it's about to fall in that's what a facelift is god's not interested in a facelift he's interested in a new creation that your own life has done away with and a new life has begun he said now you can't preach that in the old church so you ain't gonna stand that jesus said it in luke about the fifth chapter about the wine and bottles he said you can't put new wine in old bottles if you do they'll burst they'll perish he said that used to wonder me about a little bit he said i used to start on my boy's mind when i got to think how could a bottle perish when you call the bottle being old makes no difference because it's glass but in jesus time he was speaking about bottles that were not glass that were made out of animal hide and animal eye had to be tanned and when it was new and young it was been tanned it was flexible but when it got old it got dry and dried up he said many of you people know what a hide is when it gets dry it's all shrunk up and it's real hard yep i've seen them in churches oh old drunkard shrunk i ain't even talking about their age i'm talking about their spiritual age amen old and dry and all shrunk up and real hard but they're believers i tell you but the spirit of god can move and they'll sit there as stone as they can be why because they become dried up he said if you put new wine in that it hasn't got no life to it'll burst he said just like the priests of baptism the holy ghost and the real genuine power of the resurrection is trying to place that in before the people when you do what happens if you put it in that new wine's got life hello somebody that new wine's got life that new wine is still firming it's still moving it's still it's still flexing it's still it's still uh something's happening bubbling up on the inside he said if it's put in a new flexible bottle then the old of the animal is still in the skin when the new wine goes to pushing out that skin will stretch it'll move with it otherwise when the bible said jesus christ is the same yesterday the day and forever that new skin will stretch out it'll say amen yes lord and when the new one said that is the baptism of the holy spirit i am the life of god that's working in you that new skin will stretch out and it'll say amen oh hallelujah when the new wine says that the holy ghost is sufficient for your healing today that new wine will stretch itself out inside of that old bottle and that bottle will stretch out and say amen well what will the old bottle do days and miracles are passed it's gone the season we're not in the season of miracles you old dried up cowhide he said it's almost like casting your pearls before swine when you're trying to put new wine in old bottles this is why he said i have to take that stony heart out and put a new heart that'll move a new spirit i receive he said see christ doesn't anoint ministers to preach the gospel just to have it return back void he expects you to receive the word hello somebody he expects there to be some new bottles and the wine is poured out on a sunday morning or wednesday night or whatever day of the week it is and those bottles begin to stretch out and say yes lord be it unto me lord it's my promise god i'm accepting it for me lord i'm not i'm not quenching the spirit god i'm moving in the presence of god i'm moving when he says move i'm moving when he says go i'm not going to sit on my path and my past laws and what i did last sunday or what happened last revival but when the spirit of god moves i'm a new bottle and that wine begins to pour out and the bubbling starts taking place and something has to go because this new water this new wine has life in it it's not some dried-out dry confession or some creed or dogma it's life with put his word with power in it he expects you to receive the word and in receiving the word be ready oh my my take that old cowhide you've been living in over there in that old formal condition and swap it off with some sheepskin that's flexible come on now hello somebody can i be real personable it's dangerous but i mean i heard a couple of sundays ago there was about nine or ten of you and said you know what the spirit of god moved across me and i didn't move well if i was you and i say lord oh my cow hide up make it more stretchable that when you come by i won't say no ever again that when you come by i won't i won't quench the spirit of god i won't sit down on what you want to do but i'll say yes lord i'll say yes lord i'll open myself up to you to your will and to your way to the movement of the spirit of god brother brown would equate this the same to that old burnover amen that burned over those old stags and that new that new growth underneath that was moving with a spirit and one one saying is fanaticism the other rejoicing one saying is a much emotional workup the other rejoicing and he said it was the same wind one making one howl and moan and the other rejoice mercy he said it must come for the new wine the new wine only ferments new wine it only verifies that the elements are there the yeast presses forth the bulb of the alcohol listen if all you got was a drink of whatever i don't know what to use here water is good but just just a good drink of water it don't it don't bring forth more life in the sense of wine expands itself there's a bubbling there's a almost a multiple multiplication if i could say it that way and it begins to move and it goes into every fiber and every place to where the holy ghost has direction over every portion of your life amen it bubbles it makes it perfect makes it is it because what is it doing that yeast is bubbling in there it says making that wine taste better it's giving it a better substantial holding it's making it stronger it's making it so it can't sour man he puts in such beautiful language is it when the leaven of the human element has been brought into the new wine seeks to burst the bubble that spreads forth its strength of alcohol it shows from the old church from that church all the worldly elements and it preserves the church he said grace grape juice that's a good eye that's a good one grape juice will sour in 24 hours but wine never sours because the germ of life and the wine is fermenting it's pushing it's sterilizing it's going forward it's moving out it's coming out it's going out that's why it can only be put in new pentecostal bottles it can't be put in lutheran bottles it can't be put in some denominational creed it can't be put in some of your your own ideas it can only be put in the same bottles that worked on the day of pentecost [Applause] god had 120 up there gathered in the upper room and he'd all them with his word it softened them up and he renewed them and got all that orthodox out of them and that old system out of them and he had 120 bottles laying there with their necks up in a funnel on top hey that's a good way for a bottle to come to church don't come to church with your stopper on and you're stopping at everything and you're stopping this and you're stopping don't take the stopper out and then put a funnel in there make it a little bit bigger area for the holy spirit to hit and he can fill your life even more you say well brother timothy i received the holy ghost 20 years ago you still need more wine you need to take another drink again you need to get another dip in the holy ghost again amen it's not one filler it's many real feelings hallelujah it's time we come with our cups up he said he got them all renewed and they had their necks up in a funnel on top and when the holy spirit began to raise these bottles got so alive until they run outside preaching the gospel bouncing from place to place one jumped on a stump and said this is that right back to the word which the prophet of the joy spoke about it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out my spirit my new wine into my new body hallelujah i will pour it out what a revival they was having that's god's order here comes a burst couple bursting bottles we've already mentioned it and their later afflicted man this afflicted man touched the hand of one of those said give me arms that bottle said i don't have no silver and gold but what i have let me give you a little bit and he poured that wine down on top of that a crippled man and that wine went to bubbling inside that body and bones started cracking and popping and things started happening that man been sitting there for year after year day after day begging but that wine got to bubbling on the inside of him to limbs that had never worked worked again to bones that had never moved moved again to sinews that never bent bend again and he began to jump on them feet those ankle bones popped in place and down through the street he began to run give him praise why because the wine of god got loose inside of a new bottle oh hallelujah i want to be a bottle that the holy ghost can work inside of that's god's order not a big school with a degree but a living acting experience of the holy ghost not fanaticism but the real genuine holy spirit in action amen my spirit said i'll take you see first god said i had to take the old stony heart out i'm going to be a little bit longer i've been saving up some time so just hang on with me i'll give you a new spirit see that new spirit is not the holy spirit so that's where people make mistakes they come to the altar and pray get the feeling a little better get up go out and jump around a while bounce before i find out they they bounce bounce bounce and they bounce their bounce out they never received the holy ghost no matter how much they bounce how much they scream how much oil ran out of their hands or bloody faces or how much tongues they spoke in or shouted that that was only human emotions they got a new spirit that can rejoice in the presence of god did you hear me because there's a lot of spirits that can't rejoice in the presence of god he says i'm going to say something he said i want you to sink deep and make god help there's an emotional side of the so-called holy ghost church today they got a lot of built up fanaticism run off out there because they disregard the word they go only together you've got to have the word if your emotion takes you off the word it's fanaticism amen but if your emotion is in the word it's not fanaticism and shouting and those things are in the word where were you job when the sons of god were shouting for joy speaking in tongues is in the word people want to call it fanaticism it can be if that's what you lean on and that's all and you go to seed on that as we have seen in our generation but it's in the word if you do that we said because when you do all of that and don't bear the fruit of the spirit then you're in the new spirit he said that's right but god has to give you a new spirit because if he didn't you couldn't get along with others you couldn't get along with yourself you couldn't get along with god you couldn't get along with anybody so god has to give you a new heart not a patched up one a new heart that's your intellect what you think a new way of thinking and then he gives you a new way of that's right a new way of thinking yeah buddy all you got to do is look at the world because if it wasn't for this new spirit you'd be thinking like the world thinks amen yes sir they say well you sure i i i don't want to go to hell i i want to accept christ that's all right that's your first step you don't want to go to hell except christ he said after that i'll give you a new spirit what is that a new desire but that's the new spirit notice in order of scripture i'll give you a new heart a new spirit but then i'll put my spirit in there my spirit in there that's what the scripture says here that's the order the numerics the numerical order of the scripture a new heart a new spirit and then my spirit oh hallelujah so what is his spirit he said his spirit is the holy ghost this holy spirit god's new heart that he puts in he sets right his new spirit his spirit he sits right in the center of you that's your impulse that's your emotions that new heart that new spirit but then the new spirit sits right in the center of the new heart and then god's spirit sits right in the middle of the new spirit and the new heart and it controls everything he said it's just like a mainspring of a famous watch it's self-winding you don't have to wind it every day god has wound it once and for all oh he sets it right in the middle of you and it don't have to be rewind it don't have to have a new youth camp to get built back up again and to get back over pornography and get back over things again that's not the holy ghost if the holy ghost is in you it's been wound up since the foundation of the world and it's never going to run out of power that holy ghost is if that holy ghost said god's spirit is on the inside of you you won't have to worry about days down the road years down the road and you've been delivered of alcohol and one day you hit a hit weak moment and you get drunk all over again if you do you've never had it never you can make all the excuses you want to make you're just pushing the can down the road what you need to do is get on your knees and say god i'm sorry i want not just a new heart and a new spirit i want your spirit i want the mainspring inside of me this guy has moved in every gear of my life it's moving every motion of my life it's moving every thought of my life and when the thought comes in that i know ain't from the mainspring it kicks it out a new thought from the word of god comes and takes its place that's the main spring operating on the inside of you it sits right in the middle of your new life as it begins to tick and begins to control every little organism of that watch the holy spirit will control every little detail of your life when the holy spirit not a new degree not a new church not a new thought not a new emotion not a new oil not a new dance not a new lip not a new tongue not a new this not a new that but when god places his spirit in the middle of your spirit your new spirit then you don't have to act mike hello somebody you don't have to act like a christian because you are a christian listen i don't have to act like a pruitt i would have to act like an atoms or i have to act like an oaks would be or have to act like somebody of some other but i i i don't have to act like a pruitt it's who i am it's on it's the blood that's in me i i hear it all the time you know i go to places and they say wow i can sure see your daddy and you when you preach and i will thank you that's my daddy i'm glad you're not seeing somebody else in me when i preach as far as some other man that i'm trying to emulate i can't help but be have have things that's like my dad he's my dad and you can't have you can't help but have things like your heavenly father if he's your father when that main spring comes on the inside of you it begins to put in motion everything in orbit in your life just like the sun does to the universe and everything around us in perfect harmony and perfect place because of that sun sitting there when the s-o-n comes into your life it's the mainspring it's everything and you won't get it until you think of it as everything that's the truth if you think if you think other things are greater and it's more aspire to be this or that and the other you'll never receive it but when it becomes your main thing i gotta have it or die i gotta have it no matter what it costs me no matter what i to do it's kind of like that man you know it asks that that old man asked his boss his boss wanted the the holy ghost like i forget the name of the man right now mose yes like moses said mose i'm going i want what you got he said all right you want what i got he said you see that whole pen over there let's go out there and get in the middle of it kneel down he said most i don't think i want what you got it wasn't it was it wasn't worth enough for him to get in that place so a few more days to come by and he says moses i got to have what you got i see what god's done for you i see how god's moving in your life i gotta have what you got well let's go get in that hall pen and let's kneel down in that old mud and let's get down and let's pray he said all right mose he began to pull up his plans and begin to start waiting out in there he said hey boss you ain't got to do that you just got to be willing hallelujah you got to be willing to give up your pride and your bitterness and your fear and your unbelief and everything that's not of god and lay it upon an altar and say god i want you more than this i want you to be the mainstream of my life he says see but when you blow up at every little thing that happens and that disposition's in you when the pastor happens to hit something that's in the word and you make this says he makes a spitting noise i don't believe that look out old cowhide watch out that new spain spring hasn't been set there yet i am at it because it controls it it makes you believe it makes you act in a certain way it'll make you act in a way till you become so salty the whole world thirsts to be like you that's the holy spirit sitting in the middle of your heart that's the main spring amen he said but when it's a yoke and your yoke with oh i just hate going to church tonight if that preacher if it wasn't so long-winded oh i like hearing him from is the prophet okay i like hearing him for a few minutes but i tell you the last time i went when i went down to that card party susie said to me do you believe to tell me the very audacity that you have belittled yourself to take your hair down you mean you wear those old old folky clothes now and you don't wear what you used to wear he said the thing of it is you just got a new spirit but it just and it kills you he said but when you get his spirit it makes every tick just right to the word of god every little tick right with the word when the word preaches on bitterness you'll search your heart and get rid of bitterness if the word preaches on sin or something in your closet you'll go home you'll kick the trash out amen if the word preaches on certain things in your life you'll go home and get rid of them it's the truth i mean the word can be preached about our time and video games and we just go right back to them go to a new revival and get all fired up and burn them and go buy some new ones you ain't got the main spring yet amen when you get his spirit it makes every emotion tick just right the holy spirit in my heart that mainspring will tell you to abstain from all the filth of the world it'll tell you to pray it'll tell you to seek after god it'll begin to woo over you it'll begin to draw over you it'll begin to move in every facet of your life well what about our are our young people going to college if they got the main spring they'll come out of college with the mainspring amen but if they got the new spirit they might come out and be filled back up with every kind of thing and even doubt and even in unbelief don't even believe it's right anymore why one day they used to shout and they used to praise god right here on the same pews you do but they never got the main spring they never got the holy spirit they never got him moving in their hearts and in their lives but see what it what is it he said the holy spirit wants for himself a body just like he wanted to land for israel and he wanted a place for israel so he said i'm going to do this i'm going to be able to draw begin to draw out of the deserts flowers and i'm going to draw out of their wineries and and things that people can live in and i'm gonna bring out of these deserted places and these desert that what happened the holy spirit began to brood over that place and not only did it brood over a land it brewed over a physical people and they began to have a longing and an intense desire i want to go to that place hey they had good livings where they was at they was in good places and good positions but they began to cry out as things begin to turn and things began they began to go into death camps they begin to say i i want to go to a land for israel i got to have what was it he said it was the tender hand of jehovah wooing them to a land wooing them to a place it was the mainspring calling them amen it begins to make it says what is it what does it mean to brood or to woo it means to make love to cool like a dove it begins to brood over a land as it did six thousand years ago and the earth without form without void what was it the holy spirit began to overshadow it and begin to woo on it and so desolate looking place it began to pop out a seed and a flower drew it and a lily and a rose and this and that and the other trees and pine trees oak trees and mountains and every kind of thing why because the spirit was pulling it out and you wonder why in services you feel such a pull it ain't a man it's the holy spirit trying to pull poor brood he's going cool cool if you'll come to me i'll give you a drink if you'll move i will give you what you have need of if your desire from if you'll just open up your heart and say yes lord i'll do more for you than you could ever think more abundantly than you could ever imagine what is that that's cool his word goes across the desk and it's whoo and you hear it off old cowhide as it begins to hit places and hard places people just sit there with their arms folded and they're not interested at all picking at their fingernails not even tuned in at all meanwhile the spirits [Music] all of a sudden next to this person over here that's been dried up is a life that pops out poof yes lord i'm here god i i hear you call and i'm responding and he's pulling and he's pulling and he's pulling he said what happens in the beginning the holy spirit began to brood over a bleak desert he said well when there was nothing never been nothing but that holy spirit began to pull and the big wings stretched over that earth at main spring that holy spirit began to pull out trees and animals and out of the animals and i began birds began to fly trees began to bloom it kept cooing until a man popped up and man and this man looked lonely and lonesome and he could begin to coo and and they brought eve out of adam and he loved adam and he loved eve and he takes them and begins to pull them to himself that's what he did two thousand years ago we'll get into it wednesday as he begin to draw upon a place that was so dark and desolate and so broken up in political chaos but the holy spirit began to coo until it found a virgin that said be it unto me how many other virgins was there in the land but he knew there was one that was going to say be it unto me be it unto me let me go on down just for a second he said god trying to bring you to himself that's why spirit is lingering that's why spirit is moving that's why his spirit is calling unto people calling because he wants a body he wants a people he wants a people a spiritual people in a millennium in a new heavens and a new earth and it begins to coo and as i read in ezekiel 36 as this spirit of god begin to go over that desolate land and begin to bring it up it moves over into ezekiel 37 and it's still the spirit of god cooing it says the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out of the spirit and set me in the midst of the valley which is full of dry bones and it caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in open valley and they were very dry dry cowhides dry nothing just broken humanity and he said son of man can these bones live and he said oh lord you know he said prophesy these bones say oh ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god and these bones

spirit and he said unto him prophesy in the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slang that they may live and i prophesied as he commanded me and breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceedingly great army and he said to me son of man these bones of the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried our hope is lost we're cut off from our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold how many spiritual israel we got here behold all my people i will open your graves i will cause you to come do you hear the coin i'll open your graves and cause you to come out of your grave and bring you into the land of israel and you shall know that i am the lord when i've opened your graves of my people and brought you up out of your grave and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i shall place you in your whole hand then shall you know that i the lord has spoken it and performed it saith the lord hallelujah if ezekiel is prophesy that there is going to be a people in this day that will receive the spirit of god they may be broken they may be in graves they may be bound by every kind of spirit in hell but there's the holy ghost powerful enough to begin to pull up on them and open up graves open up in possible situations
