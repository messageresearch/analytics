the sign in a while i said we preach a jesus who's been crucified that's a wonderful thing i believe in a god that came and gave his life and he died on a cross and he broke the back of sin and he broke the back of of sicknesses and things but he didn't just remain in the grave amen if you don't continue to continue that on and preach that not only did he die but he rose again and not only did he rise again he seated on the throne this morning amen worthy to be praised because he took our sin and he took our sicknesses and he done away with him amen he broke the back of satan where satan has lost his grip on me we got something to praise god about this morning hallelujah i want to crown him with many crowns he's a victorious christ and he's my god worthy is the lamb he's seated on the throne this morning so no matter what need we have need of this morning he has an answer for it he's got a provision made already amen he's a god who can meet every need amen does not matter what the situation is how dire it may be amen how impossible it may seem he's he works in the impossibilities amen i want to remember don burch she's from homer louisiana is in a coma right now after complications from cancer surgery so i want to remember him today brother james wilson is home sick this morning as well i also want to pray for sister laura collins she's a young wife and mother of four small children and brother eugene braun's church she just started a very aggressive chemo for ovarian cancer and then having surgery and then more chemoso amen we serve a risen savior not only

had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance and they admitted her due to fluid in the lungs and so we know the adams family in the boer family and sister rachel was going out there this week to be with her for thanksgiving so man we just ask the lord to be merciful in that situation amen god come on the scene also brother joe requests that we pray for his dad brother alvin he's been falling quite falling quite a bit lately and not sure what's causing them to do that ask the lord to touch him sister carolyn westerfield is sick with a urinary tract infection asking prayer sister nancy herron also is sick this morning and as we mentioned brother joe's away he's ministering this morning there in tucson don't remember him how many today would have a need you want to just take before the lord brother aaron if you'd come and open our service in prayer [Music] we know that prayer works we know that prayer works because we have a king who came and died and ascended on high and he sits even now on the throne to intercede for these needs you know you never know if it's going to be your prayer that touches the throne of god you never know if it's going to be our prayer you never know but what i know is is that he cares and he listens and he's already provided so if we could take these needs as if it's if it's our loved one with cancer our loved one who failed our loved one struggling and each and every one of us intercede with all our heart looking to a worthy lamb so let's take these needs and enter in right now and go before his throne with all of our heart father we stand here today lord jesus recognizing what a privilege it is lord lord yes it's a privilege to be gathered with your people it's a privilege to come together on a sunday morning in this building but lord it's a privilege that we know that we have the opportunity to entertain you this morning lord lord that you promised that we're two or three would gather you would be there lord we know you're

the foundation of the world lord you knew and that's why you took those stripes you knew and that's why you went to calvary lord because you provided for it before the need was ever here lord we hear of this young mother there lord battling cancer oh lord how it seems so scary and lord truly to the human mind it is but we can stand here in an age where we've been told that we don't have to fear

through the thanksgiving season and we're giving thanks for you know living in a nation that's free to worship and giving thanks for what god did to this but we see where it's going really not to be honest a whole lot to be thankful for anymore and when you look around and you see all this taking place and where it's going and direction is headed as far as naturally speaking but on the other hand if god's been good to you if he's been your savior's been your healer if he's been your deliverer if you paid a bill when you couldn't pay he's done whatever we got something to be thankful this morning it's an eternal thanksgiving we're going to be eternally thanking him for amazing grace how sweet the sound is saved a wretch like me i once was lost but mercy and grace came down my trail that's why i can say every praise it don't go to my country it don't go to my government it goes to my god hallelujah now let's sing it like we believe every praise is is of worship [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] oh is he is [Music] yes he is one more time he's my savior oh yes [Music] won't just give the lord a hand clapping praise this

[Music] hallelujah [Music] ways you expect the service to go we're just going all right amen you ready for the word this morning i just got this song on my heart and i had never sung against my brother mike to help me with it if you knew like i knew what he's done for me then you would know the joy that i got amen well you don't know like i know what he's done for me is [Music] and i get happy when i think about all this stuff [Music] he's done what he's done for me i'm so blessed oh [Music] it makes me shine it makes me shy amen are you glad that you that you can testify and i know

to change your life amen what's wrong with testifying about what he's done for us what's wrong with praising him amen while the rocks would cry out if we didn't praise him he's done so much for us hey man he healed my body when i was sick he saved me when i was lost hey man he reached way down when i couldn't look up that far he came down for me amen he sent a message in this end time by malachi 4. amen we've seen elijah the prophet it's changed our lives has turned our hearts back why should we shout about that why should we praise the lord about that amen we got something to be excited about and rejoice about amen we're the people of the resurrection the people of the book we have an inheritance where people has been called for this age in this time we have a purpose and god has a plan for our lives amen we're stepping right into that plan amen the step we take we know he's guiding us he's leading us maybe today you're just looking to the lord and saying lord i i just need to know which direction to go well i'm just going to tell you right now what direction go forward never backwards never to the right or to the left to stay with the message amen walk right on with him take another step get a little closer a little higher experience more than you've ever experienced let the zeal of the lord eat you up this morning the feel of the lord the seal for his house amen let it be so zealous it causes you to repent of every other thing let every other thing go your own ideas your own ways let the word of god have preeminence in you amen today we want to go to the lord and we want to ask his blessings today upon the word as we would read it maybe you got a need in your life today you just say jesus don't pass me by don't pass me by i need you lord we just come by my way speak to me in a very special way i pray that he'll do it today amen let's talk to the lord father we just want to express our love to you i remember lord when you turned my life around just as a young child and made me realize i had a father oh that father he's my comforter my strength he's the one lord that's my companion my strength giver my encouragement comes from him and i'm looking to you today lord there are many that reached out to you with a hand that was lifted said i need you to come pass by my way today i pray that you'll minister to them in a special way not only to the scene audience but the many that are just joining with us from foreign lands everywhere and throughout the states and canada every need lord you know their needs some of them are shut-ins they can't go and they're up up in age and sickness has got a hold of their body and they would love to be here and if they were here they'd love to trade places with any complacent one they'd love to be here to be able to lift their voice and praise one more time to express their love back to god one more time in the service in the company of his saints i pray lord even in their solitude as they reach out to you and their voice is lifted you'll speak to them in a special way today let them know they're not forgotten let them know that you're ever near and ever able to meet their need i pray lord for those that are sick and convalescent lord i remember some years back when a little little sermon that we preached reached a little mother that was dying and laying in bed died and in that moment faith came into her heart and she heard the word she reads from there is still alive today for the glory of god lord i i remember another hearing the word preached and having insulin dependent diabetes and there was lou about to lose a limb in you lord in your mercy stirred her heart to believe as you heard the word priest lord your word is still the truth and as the word goes forth today it can cause faith to rise in the hearts of your children lord we want to thank you for every miracle sign and wonder you did in the past we want to thank you for elijah the prophet and how you used him and glorified your name through him but lord we need a present tense god today and we're asking lord that you just come by our way and speak to our hearts as the word of the lord goes forth may it just touch the hearts of your children meet every need lord there be someone lost and there are backslidden away from you cold and different maybe this today they turn around but they really can then testify what the lord has done for them i ask it in jesus name amen amen god bless you may you bless his word as we read it this morning if you'd like to turn with me to revelation chapter one we'll read from the ninth verse amen and i want to give a special welcome to brother leo chambliss back there god bless you brother leo amen i i was wanting to give you a special welcome this morning a special greeting good to have you sister janet in church with us today and all of you that has assembled together with us amen the guest that's in our midst already from the roncalli family coming in and different others that that are here already um well it's thanksgiving so you know we have uh different ones that get to come in and and be a part with us today so we're really happy to have you and it makes our thanksgiving even greater amen to have the saints of god gather together with us revelation chapter 1 and verse 9 i john who also am your brother in companion and tribulation in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in the book and send it to the seven churches which are in asia and to elvises and under smyrna under pergamus under thytara under sardis and under philadelphia and under laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one likened to the son of god clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes where he has a flame of fire and his feet like into fine brass as they burned in a furnace and his voice had the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars out of the and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me sailing to me these wonderful words fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and i have the keys of hell and of death amen god bless you as you're seated we're going to be speaking on this morning on the resurrected people i hope to get a little more into this passage of scripture as i've read it for several services but that's okay we the word of god is eternal it never grows old it doesn't spoil amen it even will keep to the next service amen so god bless you it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning we won't be having a wednesday night service this wednesday and because of thanksgiving holiday coming up on thursday and many are traveling and others making preparations but you know we have so much to be thankful for and remember what it's all about as we gather together with our family and friends and and uh maybe if you know someone here that doesn't have family that can gather somebody that would be left out invite him to your home we do that every year ourselves you know we practice what we preach so anyway it's um it's always good to be together with god's people and we're looking to the lord today now as we have read this wonderful scripture this morning and i think in light of the coming resurrection of the dead that we should all anticipate and look forward to the apostle paul asked the question where oh death is just your victory or where death is your sting and that's found in first corinthians 15 55 whatever our complete victory it is a refilling of the holy ghost that gives us that victory that refilling is the dynamics that raises the dead and raptures us into glory as brother branham told us in the great message what shall i do with jesus called christ the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the skies the dynamics is the holy spirit so the church should be under expectation anticipating not just the coming of the lord but this refilling of the holy ghost that he said that would come that would be the dynamics or the firepower that would lift us off of earth into glory and it's something that we should be praying and and seeking and asking and desiring with all of our heart no matter how long you've been a christian no matter how great a portion of the holy spirit you've already experienced it ought to be a call within the heart lord i want a refilling of that same spirit because it's going to take a refilling of that to lift the church out of earth into glory amen and all of us should be able to recognize the need in our own lives for more of god i think that's one of the great uh evidences of the holy spirit in one's life is this insatiable desire for more of him something that cannot be satisfied with one meeting or just even one time at an altar or one time in prayer or a couple of times or a couple experiences along the way but something that once you get a taste of it you just want more of him you want to experience him in a greater way it's enoch's walk you're taking a progression you're going another step you want another adventure you had a taste of him but you gotta have some more of what you already got amen in the end the prophet god told us it will be a sound from heaven with such a powerful baptism of the holy spirit that will take the bride into glory as brother branham told us in three kinds of believers that's the reason i believe when the bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that are taken from the earth in a rapturing grace god promised it i don't care how many science or how many astronauts is signed up and everything else and how many million miles they can see i don't care nothing about that there is a heaven and there is a literal jesus christ there that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth god said so that's what believers believe amen and today i believe that with all of my heart is a believer and looking at what he said a sound from heaven with that it takes such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that'll take her from the earth into in the rapturing grace what a promise that is you realize today that opens up a great opportunity to you for more the holy ghost than you ever had in your life amen for the experience that you have to be enlarged become greater amount whatever whatever experience you may have experienced him only in justification forgiveness of sin or sanctification the cleansing of some habits and you realize you need a real feeling of the holy ghost then that is wonderful and unnecessary and it is the token it is the requirement for the leaving here it's the ticket amen to this great rapture it's the holy ghost the token is the holy ghost and you must have it amen it's not a book it's not a tape it's an experience it's where you meet almighty god and god comes in your life and it saturates your being and it changes you it gives you a new heart it gives you a new spirit it puts god's holy spirit in you and you and god become one together hallelujah amen and in that oneness you seek i want more of that jesus i want more of that god i'm going to experience it more no we're not like laodicea that says i've had all i want but there's something down that burns on the inside i'm gonna have more of him i must have more of jesus than what i've ever experienced i cannot afford to be a mossback christian that's like an old turtle that's been out there so long in the water he just turned green with moss amen but i want to be something more than that amen i don't want to be a mosque backslidden cold and different as brother branham said this bride will not be a lukewarm she will by no means be allowed to see us she will not be a christ rejecter but she will be one who welcomes the unwelcome christ well brother tim i just don't believe this thought of jesus coming and ever i see him and every plane crashes and car wrecks and pandemonium everywhere and well let me just say that scenario is not even the rapture when jesus catches away his bride it's like romeo and juliet juliet he comes and steals her away in the night it's a secret rapture of the church and know that the world will not see the sainted dead nor will they see the lord who we meet in the air amen but the rapture is not the only coming of christ that this end time will experience because he will come back again with his saints you see brother branham taught us there are three comings he came first to redeem a bride then he'll come for his bride and then he'll come back with his bride and of course there are two of those comings that are promised in this last day amen in fact they're not very far apart with a three and a half year tribulation they're only three and a half years apart so you see when when he comes back with his saints then ever i will see him and the world will that we know will come to a complete stop yeah cars airplane missiles will all come to a screaming halt and to come crashing down as the earth burns for the millennial rain you say well that's impossible well for mo for noah's day there was water in the firmament that came pouring down even as fountains of the deep broke through the surfaces and next thing you know a whole world was destroyed with water amen we're right here at the third state of stage of redemption amen where where that there is going to be a a fire it will be a preliminary fire for the for the cleansing of the earth for the millennium in preparation for the great coming of the new heavens and the earth a thousand years later but even even then the the world will catch on fire and then the the the heavens as we know already are filled with flammable gases and one day the heavens will melt with a fervent heat amen now that's why we can look away today from all that's temporary around us so that we can get a glimpse and we can see into the eternals now those that whose hope is in remaining here are desperately trying to fix it they're trying through politics they're trying through making preparations of you know for food storage or money or or some type of gold or something you know or guns and you know they're they're making all kinds of preparation because they're trying to stay here that is not the goal of the believer amen we are trying to leave here and that's what our heart is is not on staying our heart is on leaving even every preparation we make in this life's journey is on leaving here people live for the moment they live for the time they live for the day but we are people who are living for eternity because our life is much larger than what it is than this temporal life here now as brother branham tells us and i'm going to read some quotes from a sermon called mother's day and he says faith does not place itself upon the shifting signs of what it can see faith rests solemnly upon the unmovable rock of god's eternal word for by faith said the scripture she did this and he's referring to how that moses mother put the baby into the waters and he said faith can take his stand on the rock that the waves that are beating the foundations out and look straight in the face of death and know that it'll be just in a little bit but faith can look across the sea to him that said i am the resurrection in the life and fail to even hear the waves dashing hallelujah amen you know i think in that moment so many times the saints of god embrace that moment they have a zealous anticipation i remember when my wife was was passing you know before that time she uh you know in the months proceeding she was afraid to be alone and i was on a really short leash and and she didn't want me out of her sight and i you know i felt like i was almost her security she was always afraid something was going to happen and and she wanted me right there and all of that but when she come down to that moment when we sat together with our last conversation and i said karen i don't know when we're going when we're going to leave i said i may go before you but i said you know you got another brain bleed and you may go and i said to her i said i i believe i know the answer i'm sure i do but i just want to hear you say it are you ready to go meet the lord she looked at me with clear eyes and she you know facing some very serious moments and she said tim yes i am prepared to meet the lord that's the way you want to go and just today or the day before she would leave this woman that's been laying comatose for two weeks in a bed hasn't moved a muscle laying there in a bed and and even with the the the drawbars drawn up except the one that you know at the end where you can get out because it's illegal to to close all the doors or all the bars on the bed it's called um what would it be called entrapment anyway they they keep they keep a bar down and even when the patient is alone and they're about about three o'clock in the morning this wife of mine who has not spoke has not moved has not taught has not opened an eye has not moved a muscle for two weeks somehow another slides down out of the bed comes right down puts her feet on the floor slides down on the floor and lays over and they find her there in the floor what was it she was anticipating a release without fear she could look into the eyes of death and embrace it and she could reach for a theophany that was coming near her as heaven was drawn near and uh and earth was beginning to recede and darken and fade away here she reached for that which is eternal where you never die where there's never no sickness where all is light because there is no night amen because in his presence there is no darkness or shadow of turning you see in a moment like that when the waves are beating and death is coming in faith can stand like a solid rock knowing i know my redeemer lives i'm prepared to go into his presence brother branham they complained to him apparently because someone said to him you preached too much on the resurrection and he said they said must ever message he's got something about the resurrection and he said why sure it's the cardinal that means the fundamental resting place of the gospel no matter what he did if he did not rise again from the dead then it was all in vain it to me proves that he was god it proves every claim he had made the resurrection and and it also is the place of the resting of the soul it is the starting point it is the crowding of our consolation and when we see that he raised from the dead it places us oh my when we see he's alive that he's risen from the dead when we see he's alive it places us with the gospel armor at the battlefront to take the place to fight for we know he said he that will lose his life for my sake shall find it again hallelujah amen when we can see he's alive it places us with the iron to stand out there and fight because we can fight for a conqueror amen we're not fighting for a defeated one we are fighting for a mighty conqueror and he said i think it's a great coordination of the full gospel it is the resurrection and it's the its divine promises and the consolation that it gives those who are trusting it for it promises the great union of our united together again it promises then to fade in a way of all sin it promises to fade in a way of all deformity all the sufferings that we did have and have go through it promises all the vanishing of it all it promises even death will lose its hold and will rise in the likeness of jesus so my opinion the great the resurrection is the greatest of all the promises in the things of the scripture that's where it sealed it and the last easter i was preaching these five things and you remember this because we are tape listeners living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away but rising he justified freely forever amen and someday he's coming all glorious day and that's the day he says for me that great day of days to see what it meant to what means to all of us in the resurrection as we labor and wait for that blessed day of days it gives the promise that someday these old weakling weakening feeble gray-headed broke-down mothers and dads will be changed not only will mother sit there by ourselves but all of her family will be with her what a day that will be what a time it will be when we look upon the faces of those we love so well i think of brother branham when he went beyond the curtain of time and the great welcoming that he received there from all from all over the thousands coming down he said he called them millions millions of them just coming down and each one waiting for their turn to embrace him clapping him on the back and said we knew you were coming [Music] we we couldn't wait for this day what a difference that will be when we see our loved ones what's well the way they'll be afflictions taken away the mars of suffering will be done no more pale cheeks of death no more tears from the eyes the resurrection promises all of this there'd be no more funerals no more patting the baby on the cheek that's like a piece of stone where the undertaker's embalmed and pushed out and put pain to to to look natural it'll never be needed again think of that when we're standing with them we see them yonder our loved ones our mothers our kindreds our friends and to see them in immortal bodies their celestial bodies watching their character seeing how they conduct themselves with that sweetness and quietness no more nervousness or flusterations amen to see them standing then and standing in the likeness of the the lord jesus that'll be a wonderful day amen now as he says on that resurrection means so much to me i'm anticipating that great crowning hour and then as the light begins to spread we'll know as we are known we'll understand and we'll remember our acquaintances brother branham said the longer he was there he said the more i began to recognize friends that went on you know it might be a little difficult i knew you looking at a certain time in a certain age and i didn't i you know and then i see you young again and see you i may take me for a moment oh yeah that's him yeah that's that's them i i remember even that really really vivid dream i had of my mother when she walked in into the room and i could see her in a beautiful white garment gown like it wasn't it wasn't like a evening gown it was it was it was a dress of some sort but it was white that's all i i really didn't pay a whole lot of attention to is and and so on i just was looking at her and as she walked in the room and i i saw her and i i thought my i know her somehow i know her now i was born when she was 33 years old so by the time i remembered her you know she was middle-aged and yeah you're middle age at that age you may not want to admit it but you're middle age timothy had a birthday yesterday 45 he said i'm halfway to 90. help me lord so you know they're there again you know we as i watched her walk in and and i i i'm trying to figure out who she is that woman looks familiar to me i know her but who is she and she she walks in and she she sits down just about as far as from here to that pew from me and she looks at me and i i'm looking at her and i'm looking for somebody to talk to and not turn and brother ron spencer was standing there and i said brother ron i said that woman that lady right over there i'm kind of whispering to him so she won't hear i said that lady right there she looks remarkably like my mother and at that moment she looked at me and she said it is me tim and i just want to tell you i just want to tell you you're well thought of over here and i'm so sorry for all the trouble that cost you you know as i looked at her for a moment to help me to see her all of a sudden her old face when she was 90 something years old 90 let's see 92 years old it comes and it meets right back on that body for a minute and lifts back off just so i can i can identify it exactly and i look and i look at skin so beautiful so young so so pretty i see the familiar wave in her hair her shoulder-length hair it's not a fiction it's not just a fancy story it's a reality the bible tells us the prophet tells us and then there are then there are literally thousands of those with near-death experiences that can tell you the same thing amen but he said that it's a great crowding moment he said you know and as the light begins to spread and we become known as we'll know as we are known we'll understand and we'll remember our acquaintances and the ones that has been there and many many there be many there that we didn't even think would be there think of that many there we didn't think would be there are you listening to me amen brother zane listen real close amen for you'll know it it's at that time i believe that the bread that we cast upon the human troubled waters will return to us on that day when we see the effects of our testimony on people that we didn't understand their actions toward it we'll probably be there what a day that will be in the seeds that we sowed not even thinking that what they would do but here they are they brought forth precious fruits and we'll see them on that day the wayward loved ones and relatives i'm talking about a god full of grace of god that is full of mercy and i think of the thousands i've seen converted yes to the millions now going in what their ministry was and oh it'll take more than a resurrection it'll take eternity to go around shaking hands and finding things out that i don't know now there will be those old gray-headed mothers that you're wearing those white flowers for today that's a tradition here in america you know wear a white flower for for uh for a mother that has already gone on and they'll be beautiful not represented by a pot of flower or some grey-headed mother per or grey-headed person but in the likeness and the beauty of the resurrection they'll stand in the likeness of christ their celestial bodies young and beautiful forever sure that's the rest that's the mother's day that i'm waiting for that's the coronation not the the coronation on the on the lapel but the coronation of the soul not the carnation on the lapel but the coronation of the soul for god has changed her i think of my old mother you know old and feeble shaken with palsy she'll not be doing there that day it'll be different and the great light begins to spread out as we begin to look around and the great circle will begin to get greater and greater and greater and it's all just reflecting the approach of jesus and after a while as the song said i shall see jesus at last he'll be waiting for me jesus so kind and true on this beautiful throne he'll welcome me home after this day is through then we'll see him and will not be as we are now we will know how to love him more think of that when we get there we'll even know how to love him more will not stand back with a little fear because we'll be like him amen he'll be more of a relative to us than he is now we'll understand him better because we're so far away in these mortal bodies but then we'll have a body like his glorious body we'll know how to worship him and when we see what his presence of his being has done to us it has changed us to back the old back to young and all the deformed are you listening to me now all the blemishes all the deform a man straightened out will understand then why his power has healed us the questions that has been in our minds and we get questions along the road we wonder we question why and why did this happen and why did life turn out like this and how come i went through this tragedy i better try to be a real christian i tried to stand with the lord i did everything to believe i i i confessed the promises i did everything but you know again again you know we get questions in our minds and he says and and he said the question that's been in our minds how can he do it what would this somehow mysteriously they'll all fade away the knots that has been tied in the back of our minds how will this be how could it be somehow or another the majestic fingers will just untangle and unravel those knots and it'll all fade away into one big crown of love the questions the wonders the troubles the wise all the tangled knots in your mind why is this this way and how could this be and why does this happen that way and why is life so difficult and why do that i have such a hard time why why was my road and my cross so heavy why did others seem to have a lighter cross than mine all the knots he will take those majestic fingers and will untangle and unravel those knots and it'll all fade into one big crown of love it was him who promised this in revelation 1 that which said a sharp two-edged sword went out of his mouth he was called the word of god it was from the same lips and said i'm he that is alive that was dead and i'm alive forevermore from those same lips in saint john 6 to 30 it says this i will lose nothing but i'll raise it up again at the last days was made him that made the promise those same precious lips he's the one who saves us who heals us who redeems us and who will raise us up at the last day now sitting here today there may be some of you that's actually the weakest link in your family maybe you're not here maybe you're only listening in maybe you'll hear this months from here but you're the weakest link in the family and that weak link that weakens link that would separate your great family on that day and you would be missing on that day may the god of heaven somehow in his majestic and mysterious way unravel all those little nuts that is tied in your mind is there a god or does he really care for me you know have i done too much to be saved or you know if i cross the line or all these other questions or whatever that you went through you know why why why why why why did this happen to me may god unravel those little knots in your mind and reveal to you the love that he has for you and you come sweetly to serve him little knots that get tied up in your mind because of science because of the evil age because of all the doubt the confusion the demonic influences the powers of evil spirits that predominate this age where that even more has been released in this time 300 million supernatural demons into this age crowding in as if there hadn't been enough devils already down to the ages this age gets a lot more little knots tied up in your minds accumulating there things that says god isn't real or questions his reality or that the message isn't true or the bible isn't so knocks in your mind that's caused by others sometimes even by church members preachers friends amen says you know that nuts that are in the mind of popular opinions of the world what the great theologians are said or the smart minds are brother braden would say let them unravel this morning by the immortal as he vibrates across the words of god's bible like a well-tuned instrument to sing the rhythm i am he that was dead and is alive forevermore and a little while the world sees me no more yet you will see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and it shall come to pass oh listen he say that is singing out of every scripture it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and signs and wonders the old men will dream dreams and young men shall see visions the signs of the latter rain and the end times let it be felt among us hallelujah this this outpouring of the holy ghost this final outpouring where he begin to pour it out from the day of pentecost and he empties it into a people in this last day come on amen the great outpouring of the spirit that will lift the bride off the earth in the glory let it bring you to a filling of the spirit that resurrects you from dead works to serve the living god i think of these knots sometimes that are in people's minds preachers trying to convince them twisting their minds to oh we're not to get excited about this you know it's just to be sane and sensible no we don't want anybody to shout you know all this emotion is not wanted and it is not needed it's not needed and certainly not wanted you know i i hear brother branham talk about this as we look at this i think i think there there there are those who are excited they are thrilled they are zealous they're on fire amen what else do we want to see our young people do what else would we want to see them excited about someone they're just excited well what do you want to see them excited about amen well if they're just excited about jesus isn't that something worth being excited about i was at youth camp here some years ago and a young man came uh he wasn't a believer at all you know but he heard some of his friends online was coming and he wanted to come to the same youth camp you know he was just going to have a good time he didn't know it was church so he he comes there and the young man that had invited him got him to come he says he is number three in the world for a certain video game and they're excited about it he's made the top three in the world playing and practicing and winning a video game and they're excited about it they're thrilled they think it's great and i'm i'm looking at it and i'll see la dee da yeah what kind of accomplishment is that what kind of accomplishment is that for young men you can't stay awake in church because you're up all night you know playing some stupid video game and you won what did you win a sleepless night lost time worthless wasted moments and then you know that's all going on and then somebody gets upset because somebody gets excited about a real gospel that changes real lives hallelujah that sets young people on fire everybody that makes them want to live right and i try to do right come on now amen and and so you know again you know down down and and when they were leaving egypt there was a bunch that left egypt a mixed multitude there was a bunch of them that just would not believe no matter how many signs and water you would think they would be convinced when they see god open a red sea and god bring food out of the heavens and god pour water out of a rock amen when god would would put up a brazen serpent and heal all the serpent bites and win their battles and do mighty things and the thunders and the roaring upon the mountains but they wouldn't believe no matter what they wouldn't believe but you know unbelief does not hinder god it only hinders the unbeliever god was going to have somebody that was going to take the lamb amen you can be a deadhead if you want to you can be of old and died in the world all you want to but i'll tell you in that moment god will raise up a new when you say it ain't him that it's impossible to live for god when you say all the holy ghost won't keep you it won't it is not a power of god in the salvation it won't keep you from drinking and smoking and adultery and pornography when you say we can't take the land there's going to be a generation of young people amen that they got a fire in their bosom they got a desire in their heart and they're going to press the battle and they're going to go out over jordan they're going to take every divine promise brother branham told us god had to wait until the fighters all died off yes that's right and he started with a new generation [Music] under the leadership of joshua now joshua is not tim pruitt joshua is the holy ghost under the leadership of job of joshua who believed the word amen he took them to the promised land oh god here's brother brandon's prayer may this young generation of pentecostals get the vision see they went on to the promised land we where we ought to be where we have all kinds of gifts of god and that's uh that's 1963 after the seals by the way oh may this young generation who he called pentecostals get the vision they went on to the promised land we ought to be aware we have all kinds of gifts of god amen amen amen i'll tell you what i wouldn't be satisfied wherever i was short of anything god has amen no tongues and gifts is not the holy ghost they are gifts of the spirit but if they're his gifts you're telling me you don't want them amen no they don't come every time somebody get the holy ghost you don't speak in tongues every time you get the holy ghost but if you i hear a prophet saying if you laid under the altar of god long enough sooner or later you would amen i hear an apostle paul saying i would that you all spoke with tongues it must not be too bad amen amen i hear a prophet of god called paul saying despise not prophesied amen i hear it i hear him speaking of things that are laying in the word and many are claiming well we've already we're already past that you never achieved that right how can you get past something you've never been to yet amen you're still in an age or two beyond that back to methodist or baptist with a cold formal profession instead of a real genuine baptism of the spirit well you say well brother tim now yeah you're just trying to get people in enthuse well you know i happen to heard a prophet of god say in the last year of his life we must never lose our enthusiasm for this resurrection amen we must never lose our enthusiasm and we're preaching about the most greatest event in all the world not that he was crucified but he rose hallelujah but not that he just rose it went to heaven but he shared the benefits of it by coming down in your life so that because he lives you live also amen that the life that he has become lives out of your life it's called the holy spirit it's not a separate god it's the same god in spirit form it's jesus come back again that's why he's here and he's coming he's here in the form of the holy spirit but he's coming in a corporal body we will meet him in the air that's what believers believe there is a real jesus he is in the heavens he is there it was proved over and again by the prophet's ministry he's still the high priest that can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities amen after preaching who is this melchizedek in 1965 a mystery revealed because the seals was open brother branham would say i will still show you he's still the high priest and you can touch him hey man and people were called out because their faith touched god and god spoke back through the prophet to them and he said who did they touch hey man they're they're 30 40 feet from me they couldn't touch me they touched the high priest oh i'm so glad today we can still touch the high priest whoever liveth amen whoever liveth to make intercession on our confessions so we should never lose our enthusiasm for the resurrection go tell go to go tell my disciples well i kind of want you guys to know the one we buried you know they put a stone over him and yeah and you know he actually raised up out of there i don't know how but he did that's not the way they told him they went screaming shouting rejoicing from the tomb he's not dead he's risen i met an angel the stone is rolled away there is no god in that tomb he raised from the dead he ever lives i saw him i bowed in his feet and he called my name mary [Applause] they were telling about it i can imagine the wild screams and the shout as they went back to the city to tell what they had seen [Music] and if you ever really see he's resurrected because that he comes in your life too because you've met him too hallelujah amen that you know he nodding just sealed up in some tomb of religion but he rose out of that come on church amen the seals were broken off of him the mysteries was revealed of him and he comes to show himself shout it out let the world know he's not dead he's alive and also and also as exciting as that is this is equally exciting i also who was dead in sins and trespasses he had made me alive amen don't tell amen let me tell you what i know what he's done for me i was dead but he made me alive amen i saw the deadness of religion i saw the pretending of them that he's alive but i witness an eyewitness he is not dead he's not a denominational figure or a fiction he is a living resurrected christ hallelujah he lives and he said because then i live i'm going to share my resurrection with you you will live also [Music] now brother branham told us just before he leaves in september he said you know the trouble of it is we pentecostal people we've lost our joy we've lost our emotions he said that's our trouble hear it around the world right now that's your trouble you've lost your emotions you lost your joy you're telling an old drab story of some denominational fiction oh yeah he raised from the dead he died but you've never experienced it you've never met him you're just telling what somebody else tells us so it's not exciting to you we've lost our joy we lost our emotion billy graham said the other night then preachers collars turned around going down south clapping their hands beating their feet up and down the ground stomping they had something they were happy about well yeah i got something i'm happy about see yeah yeah we have lost our emotion he tells us in the message first he says when he's speaking of a thirst for god he tries to tell us don't satisfy with the world don't satisfy you you say oh brother branham i shouted once i danced in spirit don't take that wait till that satisfaction comes that satisfaction portion of the fullness of the spirit comes in and when then then these joy bells of shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit will come you won't have to do it by the music you'll do it when you're going down the road in your car you'll do it when you're sweeping the floor you'll do it when you're driving the nails and the walls with your carpenter wherever you are that joyous people and full of glory amen it won't be just in church that joy will go with you in the car as you're hearing the songs or if you're just praying and worshiping and you're just going down and your mind's turned to him it'll cut out hallelujah amen that glory of seeing the resurrected christ being the same yesterday today and forever oh that's glorious go tell amen as brother bradham said this is a quote that brother ben pruitt didn't read but he quoted the other day did a wonderful job paraphrasing it actually he said no man has a right to preach the gospel no ma no person has a right to call themself a christian until they can go back in a certain time in their life where they can come on that sacred sands at the backside the deserts where they know they have met god and all the infidels in the world and intellectual giants taking the bible explaining away all the days of miracles their past there's no such things as divine healing all this stuff like speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues and gifts of healing and the baptism of the holy spirit you see intellectual giants can come along and they can slip in and take your mind and twist you in such a way until they can actually take those things from your memory they'll point you to to other things well you know and make it well it happened in the prophet's day but it can't happen today but he said i want you to get this if a man ever stood on the sacred sands of the backside of the desert when he meets god face to face there's not enough devils in all of hell that could take that away from him he knows he met god he knows he had an experience he talked to god regardless of what that opposition is he can say from that time something changed me so intellectual giants can may be able to take away the memory of what god did for you by explaining it away and twisting your mind around tying it up a notch i mean see in the days of miracles are past but they can't steal the change that the pillar of fire brought to you on those sacred sounds amen they might twist you around in your mind for a moment but they can't steal the change amen god made the change in your life these knots they try to put in your mind twisting the quotes around in the scriptures saying the holy ghost we receive is only just emotion oh they're not getting the holy ghost they're just getting emotional that youth camp down there why they have that and them kids just get emotional i know some they got emotional and it didn't last well i know some got emotional and they did lies amen i know a lot got an intellectual conception and nothing lasted all right today the scientific theory of the modern so-called religious groups have tried to prove this is your prophet that to prove that this blessed thing that we have called the holy spirit is only emotion see you just don't stand up to their scientific theory well i'd like to ask them this what makes them change what makes the drunkard stop drinking hallelujah what makes the prostitute cease her life our evil life what makes that cancer and diseases depart from the people and the death and the dumb and the blind and the dead to raise up explain that is that emotion it has emotion with it certainly hallelujah amen anything he said that's alive has emotion and anything that doesn't have emotion is dead excuse the expression but i think we ought to bury some of our emotions religion then because it is dead it has no emotion to it any religion that has not got emotion should be buried uh-huh because it is emotional jesus when he entered the city the children and all of them all his friends christ hosanna him that cometh in the name of the lord and those religionists of that day couldn't stand it it was too emotional and he said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out something must cry out because life was there amen i want to ask you what happened to that 13 year old boy andrew glover if i know him amen who got the holy ghost at youth camp amen was that only emotion no amen the holy ghost was not emotion but it was but the experience of receiving it is emotional hallelujah you know there's a lot of people jump that don't get it hey man you don't jump to get it you jump because you got it you man you don't shout to get it you shout cause you got it it is i mean you you don't cry to get it but you'll cry when you get it amen you see it's something there it's not emotion but it brings emotion with it i was told of a young man who testified of being sound of being saved from drowning and when he does he gets emotional about it amen the event changed his life he's never been the same he was almost dead amen and and he was saved and he when he thinks about it again you know it it it makes him emotional and you see the emotion didn't save him i'm sure he while he was drowning he got real emotional haven't it help me save me save me go down below he was emotional he probably was crying shouting everything else amen but that did not save him the emotion didn't save him what saved him was the act of somebody who rescued him but when he got saved he sure was thankful and just thinking about it again made him emotional [Applause] hallelujah it isn't that that saves us even though sometimes people need to cry out amen they say jesus i'm perishing they need to get desperate before god hey man they need to call him on the scene they need to say lord i am perishing i am lost i need a savior but when he comes and saves them they can get up and say thank god i'm safe thank god i'm saying thank you for the blood i feel so clean i am so different emotion didn't bring jesus from the grave an emotion didn't keep him from the grave but his resurrection caused great emotions of joy on now amen in fact to the matter it was even sensational to jesus when he raised from the grave it was a sensational moment his body sensed it it came to life it had feeling in it again it could eat again amen he could also walk through that wall amen he could also travel like a thought amen it was a glorified body amen it was sensational come on amen and when they saw that he was raised it caused great emotions of joy and it caused great excitement to tell the good news he's not dead but he's alive he's risen from the dead you see he's the mighty conqueror and he's not just the conqueror of 2000 years ago he's still a conqueror he conquered pornography how many young people in here can raise their hand say i know he conquers pornography how many of the rest of you can raise your hand they say i know he does amen amen even if you never had the problem you know he does it you've seen it happen amen he conquered pornography he conquers adultery he conquers drugs he conquers alcohol ain't many conference tobacco he conquers every other kind of sin hallelujah he's a mighty conqueror he's my conqueror he comforted my life and then he conquered my pride he conquered my obedience he conquered my desire he covered my sin he covered my waywardness he's the mighty congress hallelujah he conquered the devils that were in my life and then he conquered he's the mighty conqueror hallelujah hallelujah here's the thing let me tell you we're not going to this service today to honor the dead we are here in this service to honor the living we are not your honor in the dead humber we are here honoring a living conqueror hallelujah he's alive he's alive he's not bad he's alive he's in my life i know he's alive he's risen within me and because he lives i live hallelujah let these others held a dead conqueror i am not hailing a dead conqueror hallelujah i'm not paying honor to the dead amen but i'm worshiping him hailing him as a mighty conqueror he conquered death he conquered hell he covered the grave he conquered sin he conquered sickness we're not here hailing somebody who died 2 000 years ago and lived a good life but a christ that is a risen christ and it's the same yesterday today and forever amen we are here hailing a conqueror that healed brain bleeds amen that healed seizures amen that healed come on somebody that healed cancer that made babies walk again amen that made that made the blind to see that it opened up the death of the ears come on i'm not talking about 50 years ago i'm talking about a living conqueror somebody that's present in our midst today hallelujah amen so brother tim preacher aide i am preaching my age i am eternal i came from god i'm going back to god i know who i am eternal life lives onto your side i'm forever young [Music] hallelujah my body don't know it yet but it will you might get a little emotional but if you feel the way i feel if you know what i know if you met who i bet you'll get emotional too if you were drowning like i was if you were in sin like i was if you know where to save your kids hallelujah i can tell what he's done for me well brother tim you're just one of those want to preach the people happy well i'll tell you what we are happy because in his death he made us heir to all things amen since the last will and testament is not in effect until the one who made the wheel died he had to die to make it to bring the scriptures in effect for me and you you see brother tim brother timothy preached on being of the same house of the house of abraham being born in that house we couldn't as gentiles but through his death through the royal seed amen then we can be born again as the royal seed of abraham and then heir to every promise that is written to abraham and his seed hallelujah so read the old testament amen say abraham and his seed amen read what the bible said it's abraham and his seed we are heirs to it is that right now again it's not in effect until the one who made the wheel dies you see when my you know a year or more before sister karen passed away we kind of settled some of our states and i wrote out a wheel to her she wrote out a will to me but that piece of paper was worthless as long as she was alive amen now i i didn't i didn't get something i didn't already own because you know me and her together owned the estate amen what was hers was mine and what was mine was hers and my but she she would wield everything to me and i wheeled everything to her but it was not of in fact until she died now now what makes us happy is not because he died that don't make me happy it makes me soft when i think of how he died when i think of the awful cost but in dying he bequeathed to us all that heaven owns amen and he made us a joint heir with him but when he rose from the dead amen he came to enforce the division of the inheritance amen you know a there again so because he lives that he can share his life with us by the baptism of the holy ghost and we have life also because he lives we lives and everything she had is ours so the same word that spoke to the groom speaks also of the bride and as the groom fulfills the old testament the bride fulfills the new covenant last wheel and testament and this inheritance makes me very happy amen now so this inheritance makes me happy and my happiness is not temporary because nothing can take it away amen amen glory to god the inheritance makes me happy and my happiness is not temporary because nothing can take my happiness away no trial no test no problem because i own everything he has come on now church amen you know the the rite of inheritance is really real i mean go get go back counter to my desk and bring me my wallet the right of inheritance is really real it is you know when my well i had a birthday here some years ago my young's grandson luke you know him and andrew they watched me as i i got a beautiful knife for my birthday i think my son had given it to me and so you know i unwrapped it and was revealing and reveling in its beauty and it was a handmade knife and the craftsmanship and i was just looking at it and admiring it and back in my room i had a little place where i i put all my knives i'm not a big collector but i have a few and so as as we as we did you know with this as i i unraveled it and whatever i decided well i'll go put my knife up in the collection so as i did my two young grandsons andrew and and and luke walks in behind me and they want to see papa's knife collection so i'm showing them this knife and that knife and you know you know i got this one here and i got this and this one came from russia and this one came here and i collected this and from so and so luke is about seven eight years old and he looks at me with all sincerity and he said papa he said you do know when you die we're getting all of this you see luke knew luke knew that you know that because you know that he would we couldn't inherit this until i died and we could not inherit all the promises of the gentiles we were we were aliens we were outcasts of the family of god we had no right come on we had no right to isaiah's prophecies we had no rights to the promised messiah we didn't have a right to jesus himself but when he died hallelujah he left to us a will hallelujah a new covenant i'm going to make a new covenant and it's not going to be on paper i'm going to write it in your life i'm going to write it in your nature i'm going to write it in your mind you'll never get away from it everywhere you go it'll be a part of your nature it'll be a part of your life and i'll cause you to walk in my statues and keep my judgments and do it amen praise the lord so you know andrew's got a

there's some joy there's some happiness his happiness he's got a papa that loves him and a papa to give him some a gift a nice gift amen oh my now it's not nearly as big a gift if he'd have been a seven-year-old but you know at 17 years old he's still a nice gift 100 bucks amen what was it he got a gift from me and because now the gift actually caused him to be happy now what god does is that he gives you a portion of himself thank you andrew he gives you a portion of his self which is the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah amen it's a great listen i gave him a hundred dollars but i didn't give him mean but when you get the gift from god you don't get a tongue you don't get a shout you get the person you get all that he is and all that he's worth and every promise that he has and every commandment he made it's all yours it's how you and i tell you since i got it you can't wipe the smile off of my face hallelujah can't take the joy out of my heart you might twist my mind around

of god who made you that not me he made me and every one of you is an heir to the same thing an heir to the throne he that overcometh shall sit with me on my throne as i've overcome and sat on my father's throne amen an hour of all things not just one thing say it with me all things everything's under your feet even death is under your feet the grave is under your feet hell is under your feet sin is under your feet everything is under your feet oh hallelujah now he's not just the conqueror but now i'm the conqueror hallelujah because now it's under my feet now i can say i was dead but

the people of the promise come on hallelujah the inheritance is mine every bit of it is mine the joy is mine amen the happiness is mine the authority of god is mine divine healing is mine salvation for my children is mine every promise in the book is mine hallelujah and he died to put it into force and he rose again to put it in the force in me and the old tim pruitt died too but now i am alive forevermore [Applause] and i have the keys i can unlock every chain the devil tries to put on me or put on his children that's why i've seen in his name we cast out devils in his name we speak with new tongues we speak heaven's language heavenly language brother branham told us it would bring forth genuine tongues and genuine new tongues it's the quickening power it's the holy ghost you're an hour this outpouring is promised don't quench it don't put it to another age you know we're running out of time we ain't got another age we're in the last days little children time to press with everything that's within you surrender your life surrender your all brother branham said i am an heir to all things both seen present future to everything i'm an heir to it and he had to die so we could get this but he didn't stay dead he came back to enjoy that life with us and in us now the thoughts in your minds you're trying to unravel the troubles just realize there's a lot of those tangles that are there that maybe you don't will never understand in this life but when you stand there with the redeemed of all ages when joy when you've when you realize that your message wasn't in vain when i stand there you know i in in this church right now i i met a little sister sister erica up there there and their families come down to be a part with us little sister erica in 1993 came to youth camp and this little short black-headed preacher came out and preached and the holy spirit moved she got the baptism of the holy ghost in that meeting i never knew that until the other day when i met her then i found out the fruits of that service even though it was only just one there were probably many but when we get over there people you rub shoulders with hey coach [Music] i thought you were just a baptist boy i'm didn't know you might would make it well aaron it was your testimony that made me seek for something more real than what i had knots in your mind i tried my best i did all i could maybe raise your children right and they ain't done turned out right commit them to god you sowed you're going to reap to love god trust believe you're an heir brother branham told us often he said there be people there you never thought would have made it well brother tim we you didn't preach doctrine like we did and you didn't you didn't not ever eye and cross every tea i didn't think you'd make it well i tell you how i made it it was amazing grace and if you make it it's going to be amazing grace grace that is absolutely amazing one thing our prophet told us when i went beyond the curtain of time he said they told me there no one can enter here without perfect love and perfect love is what you priest is the holy ghost you know because that's god's divine nature it's his divine life and his very essence of his beings is love and you made a million mistakes and he still loved you and he reached so far down that he would leave all of heaven and come to earth and go to hell for you because he didn't want heaven without you [Music] i want him there it's not going to be heaven even to me without my children there he says there'll be none of them lost man i counted i sat down with across from the table doing my taxes he said i i don't believe in hell i said well sorry but there is one well he said i just can't believe a loving father would send any of his children to hell i said i can't either i said there won't be one of his children in hell i said hell never was made for us heaven was made for us i go to prepare a place for you and i'll come again and i'll receive you to myself but in order for you to be ready you've got to have some firepower even beyond what you've worked down to the ages even what you've seen beyond this it'll be an outpouring of the holy ghost a sound from heaven pouring out the holy ghost the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost don't you want that refilling don't you say lord i i've experienced you but i just want more of you i just want more of you than what i've ever known lord i want to experience you in a greater way don't leave me where i am i don't want to stay here draw me nearer to you god speak to me take me higher purge me whatever you got to do even take the dearest thing to me whatever it takes lord whatever i've got to do to press the last mile to press the last mile i'm not going to walk alone because he said i'll be your comfortest i'll come to you i'll be with you i'll be even in you to the end of the world would you let him in today you see it takes a complete surrender so i don't even know how to surrender brother tim i don't know i don't know how to do what you said well you see in the door of the heart people want to open it and say well just save me from hell but there's other little doors the door pried selfishness temper i don't know what all the doors are in your house but jesus got to have access to every one of them he won't be welcome with one door closed you see why his relationship to you is like a husband to a wife she cannot hold back anything so ask him lord please don't just stand there at the door of my heart some of me is just on the outside some maybe let him in just a little bit won't you let him in all the way make a full surrender the more that you'll surrender the more he'll take control father take the words that we spoke today let them find a resting place in the hearts of your children deal with every heart lord according to the need there speak to them reveal yourself i ask in jesus name take all our sins away lord forgive us of our shortcomings if we stood in the presence of the almighty god where angels looked dirty in his presence then surely lord i could not come in your presence without an intercessor i could not come in your presence without the man christ jesus paying the debt that i owed who not only saves me but keeps me from sin i pray lord you'll do it father cover us today in jesus name amen

to us amen especially enjoyed that at the very end talking about our lives and the ones that we will see in heaven just from our testimony man i think it's a catholic priest that's attributed the phrase preach the gospel always and when necessary use words amen i think there's so much truth to that that our lives are preaching the gospel every single day amen let's sing that song before we go amen oh i want to see him look upon his face amen i'm looking forward to that day amen let's sing that together oh i want to see him look upon his face [Music] [Applause] [Music] singing [Music] oh
