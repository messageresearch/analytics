with cancer Lord Jesus our trust is in you but our trust is in the atonement Lord where you not only delivered our souls but you paid a price for our bodies we lay claim to that to that tonight Lord Lord for each one who's suffering though now we turn our attention to you into your word we ask you now Lord Jesus or that you'll give me clarity of thought or do you seen as I've struggled through this Lord Lord how to word it how to go about it Lord I doesn't know how you gave it to me and I pray orders help me now to get out of the way or just help me to move and let your people Lord God hear from you I ask these things Lord and I ask you to or just take these lips and shuttle Lord God where you wouldn't have me to speak and open them Lord in every place Lord that you would have the people to hear granted now I pray father in Jesus precious name amen isn't God good to us isn't his presence wonderful hoping your Bibles with me now if you will to two Psalms chapter 4 and the fifth verse we're gonna read from three different places but they're all pretty short readings where I'm starting Psalms 4 then we'll go to proverbs 3 tonight I only speak to youth in his hands we're speaking on in his hands Psalms chapter 4 and verse 5 it says offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the Lord there be many that say who will show us any good nor to lift them up the light of thy countenance upon us thou has put gladness in my heart more than in the time that that their corn and their wine increased I will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou Lord only make us me dwell in safety the focus there in verse 5 was all for the sacrifice of righteousness and put your trust in the Lord proverbs 3 and verse 1 says my son forgetting up my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and truth for safety bind them about thy neck write them upon the tablet of thine heart so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path and then finally we're gonna look in John chapter 14 and verse 1 John chapter 14 and verse 1 it says let not your heart be troubled if ever there was a time we needed to hear that this is the time let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you ye may be also god bless you you may have your seats pray God at His blessing now to the reading of the word I want to read a quote from from the prophet of God right here and he says help us dear God to buckle up tight tonight examine the post and the lintel to see if the blood is there then walk forward to challenge every enemy knowing that our great chief captain the one that met Joshua after crossing the river said I'm the captain of the host of the Lord Oh God Joshua trembled he knew that you were leading and we know tonight the morning star is over us banners are gleaming the color streaming and were bound to win if we trust in him who will not fail us and that's what I want to look at tonight is we're bound to win if we will trust in him who will not fail us listen we're going to go into it more as we go but there's many voices in the land and there's many people and many things prayin for your attention and prayin for your affection and trying to get your eyes on them but I'm telling you there's only one place tonight that you can put your trust there is only one place where you can put your soul where you can put your family and that's in the hands of Almighty God there is a constant theme throughout the scripture and we're going to see some of it tonight as we go that God watches over and cares for and delivers those that will trust in him God wants people to trust in him and he wants you to trust into him with your whole heart not just for small things not just for this or that but he wants you to trust in him for every one of your needs he wants you to trust in him for your family and he wants you to be willing to trust him with your very life if need be he wants to be the very center when you get into trouble and when things aren't going your way he doesn't want you to stop and try to figure out how am I going to get through this he doesn't want you by your own hands to try to work through it he wants you to come to him and say Lord Jesus I'm giving this situation to you putting it in your hands and I'm gonna allow you to work in my life and that's one of the biggest things that we do to hinder God is we get in the way by trying to fix everything ourselves we get in the way by trying to work everything out ourselves and I'm telling you I don't know about you but my record of fixing things and making things okay is not very good I'm like oh four four hundred and eighty seven thousand six hundred and forty two I'm bad at it but I've learned that if I'll get out the way and I'll allow God to work he passed a thousand he's never messed up he's never not fixed the situation he's never not pulled me from the pit that I was in because our God can't fail and therefore I can put my trust in him and I want to be one that always trusts in him I want to do that and yet it's a constant battle many times we say god I trust in you and we say we trust and yet our actions would indicate in the moment in the situation that we do not we hurt brother Timothy not too long ago deal with with committal and and Trust and committal go hand in hand when you trust God then you're willing to commit any situation or any problem into his hand and inability to commit things to God shows a lack of trust and how God's going to work those things out and we show a lack of trust and attract and a lack of committal by always taking things back out of his hands that we said we were committing to him God but I thought you were going to do this and God I asked you to do this and he's in the middle of working it out and we're running up snatching it from and thinking we know better thinking we know the timing of God the problem is that our God is not a time being like we are he is an eternal being however even though he is not a time being he is a God of perfect timing because he understands that we're time beings and we have certain needs and he's never going to show up late he's going to show up right on time if you will stand back and allow him to work but we show a lack of trust when we take it out of his hands and we would try to make all things right on our own or all wrongs right as it were when we try to fix everything about our family ourselves when we try to fix all of our problems ourselves instead of just giving it to God brother Branham would say it like this he would tell you to just let loose he says just let loose and let him do it and just commit it to him the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is a committal to God when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it just commit it to him he's never failed he's never once come up short he's provided for every need we've ever had from the beginning of time since you were born on this earth he's never failed you he's never left you alone he's not going to leave you in this situation here if you'll just put it in his hands tonight now don't take this tonight to mean that we don't believe in knocking and keep on knocking that's not what we're saying for surely we do believe in knocking and continuing to not but remember there's a major difference between constantly reminding God of your problems instead of reminding him of his promises there's a major difference there we want you to knock and we want you to keep on knocking that's the very essence of comital is that you bring it to God and you lay it at his feet but while we're knocking and while we're there bringing before the Lord we should do it in a way that shows him we trust in him we should do it in a way that shows him that we believe his promises are true and that we believe he's moving on our behalf how do you do this by reminding him of his promises not reminding him of your problems in other words if it you're there praying for the salvation of your children come there and begin to claim the promise as if it's already happened come before the throne saying Lord I committed my children to you and I'm just here today once again to thank you for their salvation I'm here once again to thank you that they're coming back I'm here today Lord once again to thank you for my healing that you said I could have not oh god they're worse off today than they've ever been lord I thought you said you were going to heal and that's not necessarily the kind of knockin we want to do we want to knock and say thank you Jesus your word says they're coming back your word says I'm healed thank you Jesus I'm here to tell you once again that I'm so thankful you're my father I'm so thankful I have all these promises that I'm here to lay claim to all that's mine and that's how we want to knock and that's how we want to be on his hands at all time and you say but you don't understand those circles Sansa's but you said you trusted in God and that's the balance that we have to come to we have to come to the point where we trust him no matter what it is that we're seeing this isn't to tell you to do nothing well I guess God is going to take care of this no just the opposite this is telling you to seek God and absolutely everything you do to seek him with all your heart and commit it to him your whole heart your whole life every decision everything you do lay it at his feet and commit it to him before you do anything seek Him in every decision tonight his hands is the safest place you can put anything his hands is the safest place you can put anything no I know that life can be hard life can be hard harder on some than it is on others some people sometimes it seems like draw a harder a lot as it were and go down a harder road than other people and many times there are many burdens that you may even go through in private that other people may never even know anything about and the burden many times can become so heavy and that weight can become so difficult and you have nobody you feel like you can share it with because you're trying to be strong you you have this many times we have this mentality that as a Christian we're not allowed to show when we're going through hard times we're not allowed to talk to people about or let people know that we're having a battle listen I'm more worried about you if you're not having a battle it's okay to share things with your brothers and sister it's okay to ask for a helping hand it's okay to ask for a prayer it's okay these things are okay but let me tell you even more than that what's the best thing you can do is you can take that burden you can come lay it down at the foot of Jesus he is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother and he's never gonna leave you and he's never gonna forsake you but this weight can become so difficult and the trials can seem so ever overwhelming and many of you may be in that situation even tonight and many people may not even know about it you may find yourself in the midst of the hardest trial of your life and God is asking you tonight will you trust me will you trust me in this situation you're going through will you give me all of it Trust is a great matter of importance to God and yet Trust to us cannot just become a cliche thing so many times we'll just trust the Lord it's one of those statements we say and we say it with good intentions and we say it when we're trying to encourage someone we may throw it around when somebody's in a trial we'll just trust the Lord he knows best just just trust in the Lord and you know all things are gonna work out and we sometimes say it to people when they're anxious or maybe when we're battling fear whether it be fear of the future or fear of tragedy or fear of how I'm gonna pay my bills whatever these fears or anxieties may be just trust the Lord and everything's gonna be okay and although I believe that with all my heart we can't allow it just to become a cliche thing that we just say and not actually even understand what true trust in the Lord is what does it mean to truly trust in God to trust him like Jobe did to where you can say though he slay me yet I'll trust him though he slayed me know if you look at that and you put it into a human mind there's no worse circumstance than being slain that's the end of the road it's over that's the worst possible outcome he could have got from whatever he was asking and he says and yet I'll trust him now how can you get to the point that you can trust in that way to where the one you're asking for help the one you're asking to move the one that you're needing to intercede slays you instead and you say but I trust you still that's the place of trust that we have to get ourselves to though he slay me yet I will trust him listen Jobe suffered greatly and I imagine that he was very deeply hurt by all the things he went through even his friends turned against him even to the point that they tried to come and comfort him and he told him y'all are terrible at this to put it in our English language he said y'all are the worst comforters ever he said y'all done a terrible job alright so he was deeply hurt not only by what went on around him but even his friends coming to and they came to accuse and they came do things they in no way comforted him or lifting him up and I'm sure he was confused by all that had befallen him because he had done all he knew to do to serve God he had known all he he had done all he knew to do he had offered the sacrifices he had prayed he had lived a righteous life to the point that God took note of it so I'm sure he was hurt and not understanding but Jobe was convinced of the wisdom of God even in the midst of great pain and confusion he says in joke 9 and for he is wise and heart and mighty in strength in joke 1213 he says with whom is wisdom and strength he have counsel and understanding job isn't thinking about what he feels in this moment he isn't thinking about what's going on around him in this moment instead Jobe realizes that I must remember the character of God I must remember the character of God who God is and why he can be trusted in this situation God doesn't do anything and in his will that isn't both wise and also loving he doesn't do anything in his will and that he sovereign you have to understand that we don't trust God simply because somebody told us to trust God we trust God because he's God I can put my trust in God tonight because he is God alone it doesn't matter what circumstance I am whether it's a good time or a bad time tonight I'm here to tell you he is God over the situation you're in so we don't trust God because someone tells us - we trust our God because He is God our God is holy tonight our God is awesome tonight our God is righteous tonight he is sovereign and he is wise and because of that not only is he sovereign and wise but he's infinitely loving so if he knows all and he's infinitely loving towards me then I can trust in whatever decision he makes towards me is the right decision whatever situation I see surrounding me I know it's okay I can trust him because he has wisdom and he loves me from the depths of his very heart and I can trust that he does all things and works all things according to my good because of the character of God for us humans though trust can be a battle we as humans are guided by our five senses and because of what we see and what we feel it's often times hard to trust but it wasn't always so in the garden there was no fear and there was no doubt before the fall none of these things ever existed and so they operated from a heavenly realm there there was no sin there had never alive ever been told so in that place in that condition trust came naturally Trust was just what you did they trusted one another they trusted God that the elements that came to to make up the things that we would call distrust or our inability to completely trust someone didn't exist yet because there was no lies and things of that in the garden Adam and Eve operated as it were with the mind of God it was a perfect harmony with how he foresaw his creation and it was good but very early all we're gonna see a choice presented to Eve who are you gonna trust that's actually the question that's presented to Eve that's the choice that she has to make Who am I going to trust Genesis 2:17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die this is the Word of God there is no debate he wasn't unclear about it there was no gray area you shall not eat of this tree or you're gonna die Genesis 3 and 3 she repeats the Word of God but of the fruit of the tree which is the midst of God let me start over which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die she quotes the word to the serpent if she would have stopped right there if she would have anchored right there we wouldn't be in the condition we're dealing with today the world wouldn't be in the condition that it's in today because at this point she's still fortified behind the word at this point that still her testimony at this point she is no wrong but now she's given an option verse 4 and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die what we see with even the garden now is a struggle that mankind has struggled with from that very day trust who do I trust Who am I gonna listen to which way am I going to go now I can't speak for Eve although I feel like her testimony would be very similar to ours in that has God ever given you reason not to trust him has God ever done anything that caused us to not believe what he says is true but how as many times has this world lied to you how many times has the devil drugged you through the mud and beat you down and beat you around the stump and brought sickness and death and fear and anxiety when it comes down to it for me I can't speak for what you're going to say but I'm telling you tonight I know and whom I'm gonna trust I know who and whom I'm going to believe I know there's only one that offers salvation I know there's only one that offers healing I know there was only one that gave His life to redeem me and to save me from my sins and that's the Lord Jesus Christ so I'm going to put my trust there and if Eve had done the same thing and just walked away she'd have been okay what the serpent presented to Eve was another option what the serpent presented to Eve was another voice he presented to her another way and if she had just stayed right there with the word if she would have just trusted in him she had no reason to doubt Church she had never had a reason to doubt and neither do you have reason to doubt tonight there may be thousands of voices in the land calling for your attention but I'm telling you there's only one true voice there's only one vindicated voice there's only one Word of God and it is always true and it will always be fulfilled in your life if you'll put your trust in it there's only one truth there's only one vindicated voice and we're following it in this day why was there even a question Eve why were you even listening to the serpent talked to you Eve why were you even entertaining these thoughts why don't we even listen to the voices of the world today Eve why are our conversations even on the things going on out there why are we focused on the circumstances all around us why do we allow things that would cause distrust in the word to even come into our thinking why do we even entertain those things cast down imagination to night turn away from those things tonight those things those voices they're all voices but none of them are truth you say well this sounds good and that sounds good well what the serpent told Eve sounded good because it was only one word changed it was mostly truth and he twisted one little word and I'm telling you tonight that the voice is out there tonight all the news and all the things going on in the world they're not there to lift you up they're not there to give you truth but they're there to bring confusion and give you options and give you other voices as to where you have to make a choice what am I going to believe Who am I going to trust just tune those voices out tonight and turn to the one true Living God the only one that you can trust in and go towards him tonight as hard as you can go Eve's decision to put her trust in what the serpent told her versus what the word said broke the trust that had once been so easy the trust between humans because she broke the covenant there between her and her husband and the trust between God and man not that God had given man any reason not to trust him truly not for surely it was man that had gone astray and not God but now because of this man's gonna operate underneath a sin nature and underneath that sin nature it's in the nature of man's flesh to be inquisitive it's in the nature of man's flesh to be skeptical it's in our nature to ask why to look for answers ourselves and try to figure things out to want to fix things that's just in our human nature and many of these traits are the very things that's actually driven man to the top of the tree of knowledge of good and evil a lot of these traits has is actually what has allowed man to accomplish so many things in this world and yet the exact same traits and these exact same characteristics can be very detrimental whenever you're trying to draw not not a god so this is questioning and this asking why and looking for answers although it benefited man here on the earth and their quest for knowledge and their quest for advancement in their quest for medicine and different things when it comes to a Christian and somebody drawing out of God and trying to get close to God these very characteristics actually can hinder you as a human being because they go against trust they're the opposite of trust and sure man has reached great heights here on the earth man has done some pretty amazing things now there's times you look around and you want to know how because we seem so stupid some of the things we do just as the human race you say we're pretty stupid and yet then you look around and you see these things that they've accomplished these Heights that they've reached and these achievements in medicine and and science and Rockets and travel and they've reached many many heights along these things and they've done it through the tree of knowledge they've done it through their mind they've done it through questioning and looking that's how they've done it but in this day there's a people called to go higher than men have ever gone before there's a people called to go beyond this atmosphere they have astronauts and things and they go to the moon we're going well beyond the moon there's a people called to leave this very dimension and go into the heavens and they're not going to do it with man's ability they're going to do it by being able to operate in the heavenly round that Adam what's lost but wants to restore it back by Jesus Christ they're going to do it through faith and they're going to do it by trusting in the Word of God we're going to go so far beyond anything any scientists or any doctors ever come up with it would blow their minds for them to know that things that you know as brother Tim is preach you have a greater knowledge than any earthly knowledge that has ever been here on the earth and it's bestowed by the revelation of Jesus Christ into your hearts into your lives and you have to let go and trust in and yet because of the fall our flesh wars against us our flesh wants to doubt our flesh wants to fear and our flesh wants to question why why that's the battle of the flesh and yet what you must do is take dominion over the flesh and do one of the greatest things that you will ever do as a Christian and that is to trust brother Branham would say so I trust in the Lord amen whatever it is all things work together for good you can you can't lose when you become a Christian you just can't lose just trust in him in whatever the way goes just keep yourselves set - his spirit he will guide you into the harbour it's all it'll all be alright there was some folks that came to him during questions and answers' and wrote a question to him they were trying to sell a house and they told him that we fasted and prayed and fasted and prayed and yet we've got no results we've done this and they said have we done something wrong and here's his answer to them they said have we done something wrong and he says if you're a Christian and trust in the Lord because you surely are or you wouldn't be fasting and praying see so I just commit it to the Lord say now Lord when your time for us to sell it you'll send a buyer that's it committed to the Lord take your hands off of it and go ahead he says and that's the way it is anything as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back about them now listen God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself see just let loose and let him do it just commit it to him the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is a committal to God when you can't do nothing about it just committed to him and God will take care of it listen he wants to fight your battles for you tonight Church he wants to go to war for you he wants to defeat the enemy for you he wants to take control but brother Brown says here he can't fight your battle as long as you're trying to fight it for yourself you have to step back that's the hardest thing for us to do as humans is to step back to take our hands off and go okay god I'm going to trust you I'm going to allow you to do this for me and sit back and watch him go but I'm telling you it's the easier way to go if you ever want see my God in battle if you ever want see my God going against the enemy you'll love to stand back and say he fights my battles for me he's very impressive when he goes to war he's never once lost the battle brother Brown says he wants to take your battles for you but you must let him do it without trust a relationship will not last Trust is the foundation for any relationship without it the relationship will be shaky and it will eventually fail many times faith and Trust are used interchangeably and yesterday they do work together and they are very similar and matter-of-fact when you when you look at their definitions they're very very close together and yet they're not exactly the same thing to trust is to allow one to have control authority or responsibility over yourself to allow them to have control Authority and responsibility over yourself or over something faith is believing that he can and will move in your situation but Trust is handing him the reins and allowing him to do it Trust is taking your hands off faith is believing he's going to move and this is done and he's already done it but Trust is when he moves totally different from what you anticipated or believed for but you can readily accept the outcome because he is mindful all-knowing and he has more wisdom than I can comprehend Trust is even when it seems your faith came up short or God didn't answer the way that you thought would you say Lord I trust you Lord I had faith for the miracle and I believed in my heart yet God moved in a different way and I trust him because he knows what is best brother Brown says God watches over his word he watches over his people he wants to find somebody that will believe him and put trust in him so God makes it very clear throughout the scripture that he wants a people who will trust in him that when things are at their worst and our things are at their worst and things are at their darkest that your confidence never wavers the question of why doesn't come into your mind the the crying oh God what are you gonna do in those situations he wants to respond to you the same way he spoke to Moses and says why cry to me speak he had told Moses at the very beginning you're going to bring the people here to worship on this mountain and all Moses had to do was trust in those words right there and there had never been anything along the way that would hinder his faith along the journey because God already said you're coming to the other side of the Red Sea you're going to leave Egypt you're going across you're coming back right here and he's already told you you're going to go into rapture he's already told you that you're going to make it he's all you've already been seen on the other side by a prophet who went beyond the curtain of time so I may go through something today I may go through something tomorrow I'm a struggle next week but I'm telling you my trust is in the Lord because I know that I'm gonna make it I know I'm going to be there I know nothing's going to stop me so I can put my trust in the Lord tonight thank you Jesus when you're in those situations and your trust is in God then we don't see the need within ourselves to intervene we can keep our hands off and allow God to continue moving we don't see the need to look for other voices or look for other solutions when it seems like there's no way out he is our way out he wants people who when the enemy comes in like a flood and death is at the door they can leave it in his hands and walk in Pease that's one way you can check and see where you're at when your trust with God is when everything is going on when it seems like there's no answer when it seems like death is at the door is your heart at peace is your heart at peace in trusting God that God however you choose to move I trust in you my heart is at peace in this situation and he wants people to be that way and I want to tell you tonight that you have a God that is worth trusting in you have a God who is that you can believe in you have a God who you can give your burdens to you have a God that you can put your complete faith in your complete trust then he has a track record of 100% he has never once fail and I say that he's worthy of our trust I say that he's done more than enough to earn our trust I say that at this point if we do not trust in him it's a slap in his face because he's done so much he's poured out so much even this generation he's come time and time and time again to show you that my word is true I'll back up what I say if I say I healed and I'm a healer when I say I deliver then I'll deliver he has never once left us here ashamed holding the bag as it were but he's always come through for us he always will come through for us and you can trust in this God tonight Oh church he's worthy of our trust he's worthy of our praise he's never once done anything that would cause us to doubt he's never once done anything that would cause us to wonder if he's going to show up on time so in the midst of pandemics you can trust God in the midst of riots and unrest going on in the world today you can trust God in the midst of hatred but between brothers and this man against that man this nation and that nation you can trust God you can trust God no matter what's going on in the midst of the chaos that the enemy promotes you can trust God in the midst of your sickness you can trust God in the midst of your trial no matter what God is God tonight Church what a time that we're living in what a time it is that we're living never has there been more voices upon the earth never has the circumstances seemed as dire as they seem right now never has the manifestation of evil been so obvious all around us and never has has people giving up their trust and allowed their love to grow cold as they have in this age people have allowed their trust in their love to grow cold and it's because as it says in Matthew 24:12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold in other words it was so evil around them and there was so much wickedness around them they allowed their circumstances and the evil around them to make them begin to wonder is it real is it true how can this be why would God allow these things to happen look at all this going on in the world and because the iniquity was all around them their love for the truth began to wax cold their eyes got on the iniquity and off of the fact that God had never done one thing to cause them not to love him had never done one thing to cause them not to trust in him and unfortunately you find that even amongst message believers today because they're being shaken by world events not recognizing that the very thing that shaking them is the fulfillment of his word think of that the very thing that's shaking them that should be giving them courage it's shaking them and it's the fulfillment of his word because his word has never failed it and the hour that we are living in is the word of God come to pass think about that for just a minute the hour that you're living in right now is the word of God come to pass it should literally that then you're seeing that is shaken so many people should literally make you believe more now than you've ever believed before in your life it should make you more of a believer every time you see the Word of God come to pass this hour is the word of God coming to pass the evil the nation against nation the love self the hatred of one's fellow man it's exactly what we were told was going to be here it's exactly what we've been expecting all alone and yet people are just marvel my can you believe this is happening it isn't well have you ever read your bottle this is yes I believe this is happening it's what we've known was going to happen all alone this is the fulfillment of God's Word is it not shaking you know it's causing me to push in more than ever it's causing me to believe more than ever it's God showing me once again if I said it it's going to happen he's showing me once again he's trustworthy this is his word being fulfilled in our very miss giving you the opportunity to get ready he's coming soon and he's telling you behold I come quickly he's giving you opportunity and shouldn't be shaken you you should be thankful thank you Jesus thank you Lord your word coming to pass right before my very eyes [Applause] second Timothy 3:1 this know also that in the last day perilous times shall come check we're there Daniel 12:1 and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time check where two for two and there's many more we can go on that all the Scriptures you read about the end time you're seeing it fulfilled around you every single day this is the time to trust more than ever to press in more than ever these things only vindicate his word all the more this isn't something that should ever make you doubt he told us these things were coming and the many times the problem is is we're not spiritual about things we look at everything through these physical eyes but there is a spiritual aspect to all the unrest in our world it goes much deeper than nation against nation and race against race is much deeper than that but there are spiritual powers at war with themselves to set themselves up for power in Satan's Kingdom when it's fully manifested these anointings flow onto the people and they are manifest in the physical world but the things you've seen you look at and you go that's crazy that makes no sense it's because those people are under an anointing from a spirit that you cannot see from a demonic power that's moving in this realm and the only thing that when you look at this you see you have to recognize that the full manifestation of Satan incarnate is just behind that it's not far away when you see his anointing begin to dictate governments and you see the things that begin to pass and the way they're talking and the way people are treating you know that that man of sin that is about to be made manifest very soon in this realm and we're blessed to be able to see with eyes that let us know that that's what's going home and the only thing holding back these powers from a fool and complete takeover of the world a full outpouring of the plagues in a fool ruling of pure satanic chaos is that you and I are still here the only thing holding those plagues back is that the spirit is not fully lifted off of the earth yet but it's still here but I'm telling you it is lifting it is lifting and it won't be loaned and I'm going to lift with it and once I go they can do what they want with this whole world I'm not worrying about it because one day I'm coming back to it and when I do we'll walk out on the ashes of the wicked but that's the only thing holding it back right now he that letteth will let until he be taken out of the way but those spirits are pushing in and they're pushing in and they're pushing in and the bride of Jesus Christ being here on this earth you are the only thing holding it back well how can you stand there and not be afraid because I can trust in him I can trust that when he leaves I'm going with him he won't leave me here he's taking me to the place he said I go to prepare a place for you and Lord I trust you I believe you I know it's waiting on me and I'm coming to see it soon don't I trust in you tonight we must be able to recognize the spirits operating behind the movements in our world and be careful what we identify ourselves with as Christians so quick to swallow down everything the media tells us or what the people on social media are posting we're so quick to pick a side listen I've got one side I'm on the side with Jesus Christ I'm on the side that wants to see Souls saved I'm on the side that wants to see Souls delivery I don't have time to pick a side between this and Democrat and Republican and black and white and those things listen there's coming a day when we're gonna put our arms around one another and we will truly be brothers were already brothers here but in that Kingdom oh that's gonna be the end of strife in that kingdom I won't have to pick a side and that Kingdom I won't put be put down for my beliefs because we're all gonna believe the same thing we're going to know that we trusted in the king of kings and the Lord of lords will walk hand in hand and all this junk we're dealing with now will be left behind be careful about picking sides and getting caught up in and we all do sure because there's there's parts of us because we were raised here there's parts of us that look at our country and we're thankful that we were raised in a Christian nation we're thankful for the opportunities afforded to us by living in America and many times we have a love of the ideals of what America was supposed to be but let me tell you she never reached those ideals let me tell you she never got there and even as far back as when brother Branham was here he said she's a million miles away from a Christian nation you can look it up there's a quote he says I don't even pray for her he said why would I when she will not repent I don't even pray for her why would I when she won't repent so listen my allegiance is not to the United States of America although I'll say again I'm very thankful that God allowed me to be born in a place with religious freedoms and many other freedoms that are being stripped away every single day I'm thankful for that but today my attention has turned to the other Kingdom to the other place to the place I'm really from in the place I know that I'm going because I have a trust in the word of Almighty God and hopefully that's your kingdom and your kingdom and your kingdom - and we will spend eternity there if you trust in him so quick to pick a side post our opinion about things not even recognizing it's all being controlled by unseen powers spirits operating and it really isn't even behind the scenes anymore if you'll know the truth absolute insanity that seems to be the controlling the thinking of minutes not even like they're trying to hide it anymore it's obvious that God has turned them over to a reprobate mind because they had no love for the truth and they've been turned over to rev a day but listen don't even hear those voices don't give ear to them sometimes we sit there on this - and that's just this and that's so listen you listen to a certain voice long enough I don't care how crazy you think it is you listen to voices long enough and those voices begin to sound normal alright you began to become accustomed to it you begin to come climate eyes - those voices don't listen to them and don't give them a place in your life the world Iran is absolutely insane don't hear the voices and do not associate yourself with the unrest look I can't understand that people are the people that are supposed to be believers that are so anxious to fix this world people who talk about all the prayers they're praying that that God will heal our nation and fix this world why aren't you praying for the Lord Jesus to come back quickly why is that not the focus of your prayers Lord I want you to move in this nation and then fix this nation here sure go ahead and pray for safety I pray for safety pray for grace and pray for mercy while we're here but I'm not going to pray for things to get better I can't do it I would be praying against prophecy I would be praying against the very word of God if I was going to pray for things to get better I would be praying for a delay in the return of the Lord and what would be my calls for warning to delay the return of the Lord why would you want to stay here any longer unless you knew the return of the Lord would catch you in a condition that you aren't ready to go and if you're in that condition tonight then your prayer should be even so Lord Jesus come quickly come Lord Jesus to take us home take me out of this pest house take me out of this filthy world take me away from this place I don't belong here that's how we've got to be praying is this not the time we've waited for are these things not all the more reason to trust him I sometimes wonder what life people are living for I talk to brother David one time not long ago I said you just can't there's nothing to live for in this life anymore there's no future here there's nothing to live for if we're still here when my kids grow up I that's the worst possible thing I can think about that we would still be here you better be living for that life you better be living for the life that's eternal you better be living for the one that's perfect and without him we're all wrongs will be made right that's the life you have to be living for tonight there's no hope in this life there's no future in this life pray to leave this world not to stay here why are you praying for things to get better here that's something that somebody would pray who's planning to stay I'm not planning to stay here he said I go to prepare a place for you I guarantee you it's better than the place I'm in now so I'm good lord a few let's go ahead and come on down tonight and take us to that place come quickly come quickly you don't got to worry about fixing this mess it's a mess anyway just take your bride home we're ready to go and we're trusting in you tonight Lord Jesus I see the conditions that are that are described Lord in your word as the endtime and lord I I don't want to change those conditions that I can have a better tomorrow here I want to leave sometimes I wonder if we trust when God said I go to prepare a place for you do you trust that a prophet really went beyond the curtain of time do we trust that there really is a next life because if we do we wouldn't be so readily ready to pray to stay in this life and I'm not talking about someone on their deathbed you know what I'm talking I'm talking about the coming of the Lord Jesus taking us home in a rapture all these voices are trying to cloud out the one voice you can trust because Satan is the author of chaos and confusion this is why you hear all the time I just I just don't know what to believe that's the purpose of Satan's propaganda to make it tour you just don't know what to believe what's truth what's not truth there's so much this there's so much that this news says that that news says this and it's all a conglomeration of Lies none of it's the truth we've already established there is but one truth in it and there's his job to make you wonder it's his job to make you fear and make you doubt and that's the condition that we see our world in today confused and upside-down they call good evil and they call evil good they vilify those that would protect us and they lift up those who would oppose them in our nation right now there are serious debates going on to dismantle the police departments of our nation there are serious debates being voted on in cities across this country about doing away with the rule of law we have a society that wants lawlessness and yet God is a God of order you see as Satan's influence comes more and more the lawlessness comes more because it's in direct contrast to what God is a God of order it struck me so much I was amazed as I looked into at Thessalonians and I was reading Paul's writings concerning the endtime and he says in 2nd Thessalonians 2 and 2 he says that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition it goes on to say in verse 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and I found in several of the old Greek manuscripts that the word there for sin where it speaks of man of sin was translated differently and I'm not even going to try to pronounce the Greek word but I could tell it was different than that word said they make the same so I began to look and throughout the different translations of the Bible and what I found was that many of the translations used the other Greek word that wasn't the same and it reads like this I'll start in verse 3 and you can follow along if you like but it's gonna be a different translation this is the NIV it said don't let anyone deceive you in any way for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed the man doomed to destruction he will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or his worship so these sets himself up in God's temple proclaiming himself to be God verse 7 for the secret power of lawlessness is already at work but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way and then the lawless one will be revealed how obvious is it that this is the time that we're living in now how obvious is it that Satan is the author of chaos and the author of lawlessness and the author of confusion lawlessness confusion chaos but there is a truth there is an order there is a God who you can trust in tonight when all else seems confusion when all else is lawless there is still a God on the throne there is still one you can put your trust in and you don't have to fear all this nonsense going on around you there is one who said that in the time of trouble he will hide us away listen don't let the darkness and the lawlessness all around you cause your love to wax cold like those in Matthew did don't let them make and begin to get your eyes caught up on the iniquity and caught up on the lawlessness that's going around but press into God tonight more than ever hears the voice of the bridegroom tonight it's the only voice that matters in this age is the only voice that has never lied to you that is never deceived you that has never failed and it's the only voice that has never lets you down don't be dismayed when you see these things going on around us don't be dismayed when you see these things coming to pass these are the things that let you know his word is the truth because he's foretold of these things these make me trust God more than ever these make me look at his word and go it's absolutely the truth everything he foretold is now upon us listen you want to trust God more feed on his word more you want to trust God more talk to him more you want to trust God more feet less on the millions of voices out there that are constantly running their mouth trying to get your here put your trust and your feeding right here in the Word of God these things around me don't shake me these things around me don't dismay me brother Johnny these are things we knew was coming all alone we saw it coming all alone because his word told us that it wasn't because we trust in his word then we can stand fast in this time we can stand fast in the darkness we don't have to worry and we don't have to fear you say these things make you happy no no I don't embrace the sin and lawlessness that's going on but I embrace where I'm at in time I embrace where I'm at in the Word of God and what I see being fulfilled I embrace that these things must be I don't like what I see but there's something inside of me that rejoices seeing these things because I know the fulfillment of these things brings on the fulfillment of the next thing the fulfillment of these things brings on the fulfillment of the next thing and when I see these things I know we're almost home when I see these things going on around me I know it won't be long now I know it's just over the corner over in the next here I look and I see victory I know we're almost there I know we're about to break through because these things are going around me something inside of me is getting excited something inside of me is longing for a home more than ever before something inside of me says come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus Luke 21:25 says and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars and upon the earth distress of Nations with perplexity and the sea and the waves roaring men's heart failing for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nah that's why these things excite me that's why I can stand firm in the midst of chaos because I know the fulfillment of this brings on the fulfillment of that brother Branham said brothers the time has come we're in the last day we're in the Atomic Age the time has come that they got a weapon that can shake this world from its orbit in five minutes time into the Sun and cause a total annihilation they couldn't have done that before but the time has come amen the time has come where there's a following away the Bible said it's if there come a falling away the man of sin won't reveal himself the Pentecostal church is living in the final of all times the time has come the time has come for the signs to follow the believers and I believe that we're at the end time we're in the latter rain we're at the time when the men will be heady and high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God trucebreakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good heady and high-minded but time has come when they're teaching doctrines of devils perverting the Bible's teaching in theories and theologies to draw groups of people away to them the time has come that God will gather his church together through through under one great big banner of the Lord Jesus Christ and pour out his powers among them great signs and wonders will take place the time has come the time has come for the Pentecostal church to make the time has come to circumcise the church and call out this foolishness the time has come to go back to the old landmarks the time has come for the outpouring the time has come for the gathering of the people the time has come for Jesus to come the time will be here soon to give out the rewards brother be careful that your crown isn't set on someone else's head that tom has come we're at the end time if we're ever going to do anything brethren we're going to have to do it now that time is at hand Church the time has come the time has come to stand the time has come to trust the time has come to overcome that time has come for the sons to follow them that believe the prophets said the time has come someone's going to walk in that all throughout his word he went to great lengths to show that he can be trusted in the worst situations there's so many scriptures I picked out probably too many of them I won't read them all but it's all throughout the word may whom 1:7 the Lord is good a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him Isaiah 57 13 when thou Christ let that companies deliver thee but the wind shall carry them all the way vanities shall take them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain Psalms 18 and 30 as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all those who trust in him Psalms 32 and 10 many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the Lord mercy shall come pass him about Psalms 34 21 evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate the Lord redeemed the soul of his service and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate Psalm 34:8 o taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him some 44 for thou art my King O God command deliverances for Jacob through thee what we pushed down our enemies through thy name when we tread them under that rise up against us for I will not trust in my boat neither shall my sword save me but thou has saved us from our enemies and has put them to shame that hated us in God we boast all the day long and praise thy name forever Sayla something jumped out about that to me in verse 7 he says but thou has saved us from our enemies and then you go down to verse 8 and it says in God we boast all the day long David says I'm going to testify all day long about what God has done for me he says I'm going to testify all day look and somebody's got a problem with you giving testimonies about what God has done for you that's okay the Bible says you can testify all day long about what you guys know if you don't let anybody shut you down or shut you up if God's done something for you tell it if God's moved in your family telling if God's healed you tell it proclaim the name of the Lord Jesus and boast on him all day long sums 118 and 8 it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in Princes princes proverbs 30 and 5 every word of God is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him say how much did I trust him were there how much listen to brother Brown if tonight I preached and a thousand people got converted or let's say a thousand people had died with the inspiration of God fifty years ago and they rose up tonight and I was dying and they said brother Branham don't trust it it's false get away from it trust something else I'd still say let me now believing on the Lord Jesus Christ first something happened in my life if I pray tonight for the healing of a thousand people and in the morning all thousand of them was dead tomorrow night I'd be praying for the sick just the same with never more moved my faith because of this it isn't what my results is it isn't it's what God Word teaches what makes it true that's right God said so that sowed it maybe the people didn't have faith maybe it was Fault in me but it's no fault in God God is truth always always truth so we bring it back around and I ask you can you trust him that much tonight can you put it all in his hands tonight there's no safer place than in his hands his hands are ever-present his hands have a track record worthy of trust he has promised to deliver them that trust in him he has done more than enough to earn our trust but you say brother and what can he do with my life it's so broken put it in his hands what can he do with my situation you don't understand I'm so ruined put it in his hands what can he do for my children they're so far out put them in his hands you don't know how bad I've been hurt by people brother Aaron put them in his hands let go of the wrongs that have been done to you put it in his hands tonight time after time the scripture shows his lives that look ruined time after time the scriptures show us lives that seem lost and they become restored and made hold in his hands the maniac of Gadara I'm sure his wife had given up and I'm just thinking in my own mind I can see her just bowing her head one day and saying God there's nothing I can do everybody's come they've even laid hands on him they've even tried to chain him they've tried to drag men with their bare hands the wrong hands had been dealing with him but that night she bowed her head and she said God I put him in your hands and one moment in the hands of God one moment in that presence changed everything what about Mary Magdalene who had so oftentimes found herself in the wrong hands she was a person who lived an evil life and yet she came and put herself before the King of Kings in later life in his hands one moment different about the thief on the cross I guarantee you you are not in a position worse off than him the very moment of death I see his parents kneeling down to pray failures in their mind he's gonna die and go to a sinners hell that's the last they knew they knew nothing of his repentance they are gonna be shocked on that day when their son's there think about that what are we Union how'd it happen they knelt down and say God we're sorry have mercy we put our son into your hands they're having no idea that little prayer in a moment's time have mercy on me remember me today when you come into your kingdom when you get it in the right hands it's amazing what can happen when you put things in his hands it's amazing that things that can happen maybe you've never allowed yourself to be put in his hands all your running all your tryin all your fears all your failures all your wanderings in just one moment if you'll put yourself in his hands tonight just one moment and trust in him you say I struggle to trust that that I can be forgiven the sacrifice is enough the blood has washed away all your sins if you'll just put yourself in his hands tonight and trust can you trust him tonight when he says all that the father have given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out can you trust that he's telling you the truth when he offers you that come Island no wise cast you out we see situations that seem hopeless to man become miracles in his hand John six five when Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw a great company coming to him he saith unto Philip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat I love this next verse he said this to prove him for he himself knew what he would do oh he already knew what he was about to do he knew the miracle Philips answered him and said two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them should take a little one of his disciples Andrew simon Peters brother saith unto Him there's a lad here which had five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many in the lads hands they were nothing but when they were placed into the Masters hand the one who created the barley that made the bread the one who created the fish that swam in the sea you see he had made those fish he hadn't he had created that barley and put it in his hands and he begins to break it off he begins to break it off I believe brother Brown said it was cooked not just fish it was cooked fish he began to break it off because in his hands what seems impossible to you situation you can't fathom there's no way out of this there's no way these people are going to be fed there's no way my bills are going to get paid there's no way my children are coming back I can't recover from the sickness have you put it in his hands yet have you put it there and watched him and allowed him to go to work allowed him to move in your situation there's no safer place what have his hands done what does his hands and how they not formed the mountains have they not formed you from the dust of the earth do they not lift your burdens do they not lift your cares do they not carry our sorrows has his hands not touched you cuz his hands not heel Jude has his hands not delivered you has his hands not stretched wide and been nailed to a tree for you and offered you forgiveness and grace what better place to put your sorrows and cares tonight what better place to put your trust in uncertain times what better place to entrust the souls of your children and the healing of your body in the salvation of your soul in anything you can name what better place there's no other hands like his hands you say I've tried I've tried to lay it all down I've tried to trust God to move I've tried I've tried I failed over and over again everything he's coming up short nothing's going right I've worked my whole life and I'm just not getting anywhere you sound like Peter in Luke 5:1 it says and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of Guinness or written and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and we're washing their nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simons and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the
