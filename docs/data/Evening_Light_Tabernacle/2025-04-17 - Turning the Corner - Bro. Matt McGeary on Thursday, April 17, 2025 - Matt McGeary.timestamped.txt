[12:18] It's good to see everybody and have you
[12:21] here at um this the youth camp here in
[12:25] 2025. We're looking forward to a great
[12:27] time in the Lord together. and we got
[12:31] the best young people in the whole wide
[12:33] world that is uh with us this weekend
[12:36] and I want to thank you for being here
[12:38] and being a part with us uh in in this
[12:42] meeting. It's really special to have you
[12:43] here and um you know this is your
[12:46] meeting so I'm glad to see you sitting
[12:48] up front and we let the elders sit in
[12:50] the back in this meeting. So, you know,
[12:53] um that's that's great that you're
[12:55] you're here for your service and your
[12:58] time and the presence of the Lord. And I
[13:00] believe he's going to do some wonderful
[13:02] things in your life this weekend and
[13:04] speak to you in a very special way. And
[13:07] um so, you know, I I just wanted to um
[13:11] just go over briefly a few of the rules
[13:13] there before we go. And you really don't
[13:16] need any rules. Um really you're you're
[13:20] wonderful young people and and uh you
[13:23] are always respectful and I appreciate
[13:26] that and I know you will be this year.
[13:28] I've learned that through the years. We
[13:30] have the best and I'm I'm proud of you
[13:34] each one of you. And uh but you know we
[13:36] want to show respect to the this service
[13:39] and the house of God. And you know it's
[13:41] not a place to pass notes and chew gum
[13:44] and things like that. It's a a place to
[13:46] worship. That's why we come. It's not a
[13:49] place to, you know, to um be on your
[13:52] cell phones and be looking at while the
[13:54] church service is going on, but just
[13:56] show the utmost respect as I know you
[13:59] will. And u let the Lord then deal with
[14:02] your heart. Maybe maybe um it it might
[14:06] be somebody else that would be
[14:07] distracted by your behavior that you
[14:09] would keep them from receiving
[14:11] something. So, you don't want to do
[14:13] that. you want to just u put your whole
[14:15] heart into worshiping the Lord and we're
[14:18] going to look forward to hearing you
[14:19] from you and some wonderful special
[14:22] songs and and worship unto the Lord and
[14:26] u if you have a song uh you can uh put
[14:30] your song request up here on the
[14:32] platform or see brother Timothy brother
[14:34] Michael Dexter uh brother Michael's in
[14:37] the in the booth back there right now
[14:39] but um most of you would know him but
[14:42] you can
[14:43] give them um your prayer request or your
[14:46] special songs request because um it's
[14:50] it's your camp and we want you to
[14:53] worship the Lord and we want to enjoy
[14:55] the presence of God with you and uh you
[14:58] know as I said you're the best and I
[15:00] know that I can count on that. uh your
[15:03] counselors have come a long ways and
[15:06] they have have given up of their
[15:09] vacation and time to be here because
[15:12] they love you and nobody's here to give
[15:15] you a hard time. They're giving you want
[15:16] to give you the most wonderful time that
[15:19] you could have and um so we want you to
[15:22] show them respect and and um you know
[15:25] that and then of course to be respectful
[15:28] to you. We're we're here to love one
[15:30] another and ain't nobody great among us.
[15:32] no little ones and no big ones. We're
[15:34] just all one in Christ Jesus. And uh so,
[15:38] you know, we we work together on that
[15:41] and and just showing love and respect
[15:44] and you do that with your counselors and
[15:47] it'll make it a lot lot easier for
[15:49] everybody. Now, um there will come some
[15:52] camp times to remember and uh we'll be
[15:56] announcing them as we go, but you know,
[15:58] Friday morning um that's in the morning.
[16:01] We'll have 9:30 uh service and 6:30. And
[16:06] of course, if you're interested in meal
[16:07] times, well, that's going to be 8:12 and
[16:10] 5. So, you know, we'll have meal time.
[16:13] Snack sacks will be open after the
[16:15] service and things like that. So, you
[16:18] know, lots of opportunity to to have um
[16:22] your needs met and have a good time and
[16:25] fellowship with one another. It's a
[16:26] great time to meet one another, get to
[16:28] know one another, make longtime uh
[16:32] lifelong friendships. It just um uh it's
[16:36] just that wonderful opportunity we have.
[16:39] So, there will be then Saturday we have
[16:41] a a skit that will be put on by Evening
[16:44] Light Tabernacle and that will be at
[16:46] 10:00 a.m. Service that evening will be
[16:49] at 6:30 and then Sunday we we will not
[16:52] have a sunrise service. No sunrise
[16:55] service Sunday morning, but we will have
[16:58] church. So, we'll have breakfast today
[17:00] like normal and we'll come to church
[17:03] like normal except it's going to be
[17:05] extraordinary instead to the normal and
[17:08] we're going to have a wonderful time.
[17:09] It'll be at 9:30 just like all the other
[17:11] morning services. So, we'll just um
[17:14] except for the skit. The skits at 10:00,
[17:16] but um it'll be a a great time. And then
[17:19] we'll of course, you know, it'll it'll
[17:22] be just like that and it'll all be over.
[17:25] So, what I want you to do is I want you
[17:27] to make every moment count. I want you
[17:31] to put your heart into every service. I
[17:34] want you to allow the Lord to deal with
[17:36] your heart. Don't wait. Don't wait till
[17:38] the last moment, but let him speak to
[17:41] you now and start dealing with your
[17:43] heart now. And if you got burdens in
[17:45] your heart, in your life, well, I'll
[17:47] tell you what, here's a here's a place
[17:50] to to see that burden lifted. And if you
[17:53] if you brought a bunch of devils to
[17:55] camp, well, let's leave them here. We
[17:56] don't want them. We uh don't want to
[17:58] take none of them back home with us. We
[18:00] want to just be free to serve the Lord
[18:03] and and move on in Christ and grow in
[18:06] the Lord and enjoy his benefits. So, we
[18:09] got a wonderful ministry team this year
[18:11] that we have our our brother Matthew
[18:13] McGary that's going to be ministering to
[18:16] us. He was a camper at this camp. Also,
[18:19] brother Matthew Watkins was a camper at
[18:22] this camp. He's going to be ministering
[18:24] for us also. And then we have longtime
[18:27] favorite our brother Ron Spencer going
[18:29] to be ministering too on Saturday night.
[18:31] So, wonderful times together. We're just
[18:34] going to have a blessed time in the
[18:36] Lord. So so happy that you're here. And
[18:39] if there's anything that we can do for
[18:41] you some way that maybe um you can pull
[18:44] me aside any moment and just say, "Hey,
[18:46] brother Tim, you got a minute for me?"
[18:48] And I do. We'll just spend that moment
[18:50] together and pray with you about
[18:52] whatever situation that it is. We're
[18:55] here for you and we want you to know we
[18:57] love you. So we're giving ourselves to

[40:47] worthy
[40:48] of it
[40:54] all.
[41:05] Sing with all your
[41:09] [Music]
[41:12] heart. I give you
[41:16] all. I give you all.
[41:22] [Music]
[41:31] Hallelujah.
[41:33] Hallelujah. Oh, just let it settle in on
[41:35] you for a moment. Are you worthy? Yes,
[41:38] you are worthy of it
[41:42] all. Yes, you are,
[41:46] Lord. You're worthy of it all.
[41:52] [Music]
[41:57] to you are all
[41:59] praise. Oh, you deserve one more time.
[42:04] You're
[42:05] worthy. Oh, you're worthy of it
[42:14] all. You're worthy of it all.
[42:21] For from you are all
[42:24] things and to you are all
[42:29] things. You
[42:31] deserve the
[42:33] glory. Yes, Lord. You're
[42:36] worthy. You're worthy
[42:39] of it
[42:42] all. Oh, you're worthy of it all.
[42:56] [Music]
[42:59] You deserve the glory.
[43:05] Hallelujah.
[43:07] Amen. I believe he deserves the glory
[43:09] beyond the praise.
[43:12] Amen. Won't you just put in that key of
[43:15] G? Amazing
[43:18] grace. Amazing grace. How sweet to
[43:21] sound that saved a wretch like me. You
[43:25] know, none of us was born saved. You
[43:28] might say, "Well, all I've known is a
[43:31] message, and I was raised up on the
[43:32] message for you. You were lost. You were
[43:35] born needing a savior.
[43:38] It was all born in sin, shaping
[43:40] iniquity, coming the world speaking
[43:43] lies. That's just going to sin nature
[43:46] was on our
[43:47] [Music]
[43:50] lives. And it's grace that has brought
[43:53] us
[43:55] mercy,
[43:56] forgiveness,
[43:58] pardon, and he's able to change your
[44:01] life. And that's what he's here to do in
[44:04] these meetings. And I'm asking him to
[44:07] come
[44:08] now for him to take control of this
[44:13] meeting from the beginning all the way
[44:15] to the end. And I'm not just talking
[44:17] about this one service, but all the way
[44:19] to when we depart camp
[44:22] that the Holy Spirit would just say
[44:24] takes such charge over every song, our
[44:29] worship, our praise, and then the word
[44:33] as it goes
[44:34] forth. And it could change lives, our
[44:37] lives will be changed. My life needs to
[44:39] be changed.
[44:42] I need more Jesus. I can't get enough of
[44:46] it. I've been a Christian many, many
[44:49] years. Gave my heart to the Lord when I
[44:52] was five. Started preaching the message
[44:55] when I was
[44:56] 15. But I stand here today and say,
[44:59] "Jesus, could you just give me a little
[45:01] more of you?
[45:04] Could I just experience you in a greater
[45:06] way than what I
[45:07] have? Could I have even another
[45:11] outpouring of the Holy Spirit? a
[45:13] refreshing, a
[45:15] refilling, a saturating of my being over
[45:19] again. That ought to be the desire of
[45:21] every one of
[45:22] us. We just need to take our cups that
[45:26] we've brought maybe that's been full of
[45:27] everything else and just make room for
[45:30] Jesus. Empty out something where you can
[45:33] have a little more of
[45:34] him. As the song says, I want more of
[45:38] Jesus, so I'll give him more of me.
[45:42] to give him more of
[45:44] you. You know, as we approach a meeting
[45:48] like
[45:49] this, I don't just approach it, oh well,
[45:52] we're going to have a
[45:53] camp, you
[45:55] know, kind of
[45:58] haphazard, lukewarm attitude toward it,
[46:01] but no, seeking the Lord and asking God
[46:06] to help us choose the right
[46:09] gifts for a meeting. I believe it gives
[46:13] her a channel. There are channels
[46:16] through which the Holy Spirit can flow
[46:18] and heaven can just open and flow right
[46:20] down here to earth and come right down
[46:22] to your pew and speak to you in a very
[46:26] personal way. The God we serve is a
[46:30] personal
[46:31] God. He's so personal. He would use a
[46:35] prophet messenger in this day and he
[46:37] would tell where you lived, what your
[46:41] name was, what the desire on your heart
[46:44] was, what the doctor said, what your
[46:46] future would be. You see, God's a
[46:49] personal God, and he wants to be
[46:52] personal to you. He wants to be real in
[46:54] your
[46:55] life. I want you to welcome him and just
[46:59] say, "Lord, I need that grace tonight in
[47:02] my life. for you to minister grace to
[47:06] me. You know, we have, as I said and
[47:10] prayed about the
[47:13] meetings. I I wanted some men that have
[47:18] experienced
[47:20] grace to come and share with
[47:23] you. We have tonight a brother Matthew
[47:25] McCary that is going to be
[47:29] preaching. And when I started to write
[47:32] his name down in my notes tonight to
[47:35] take notes on the
[47:38] sermon, I caught myself writing Matthew
[47:44] [Music]
[47:45] Grace. I think of the McGary boys. I
[47:48] knew them many years ago when they were
[47:51] young
[47:53] men and they needed
[47:56] Jesus. They had great godly parents,
[47:59] wonderful people.
[48:00] come from a good little church, but they
[48:03] needed
[48:06] Jesus. And it was there at this camp
[48:10] some years ago, David Jr. surrendered
[48:13] his heart to the Lord and found
[48:17] Jesus. He witnessed to his brothers. He
[48:21] witnessed grace to
[48:23] Aaron. And Aaron, who's now a pastor and
[48:26] ministering the
[48:28] gospel, he was
[48:30] touched by Damy's life and the change in
[48:33] his life. You see, what can happen to
[48:35] you can impact others, your friends
[48:38] around you, even your brother, your
[48:40] sister, even maybe even your parents.
[48:43] There are people in this building right
[48:44] here whose mom and dad was not
[48:50] Christians who only heard about Jesus
[48:52] really from a grandparent and I'm
[48:55] speaking of Daniel Williams sister
[48:57] Rachel Shaw just a young girl gave her
[49:00] heart to the Lord at 10 years old.
[49:03] She began to pray for her mom and dad
[49:05] that were center
[49:07] people, drunks, just living the rough
[49:13] road. And God in his mercy answered her
[49:18] prayer and the grace of God shun to her
[49:21] life won her parents to the Lord. And
[49:24] things changed there. raised up from
[49:27] that family, mighty minister, brother
[49:29] Daniel Williams, whose lives touched
[49:33] many. Grace, that same
[49:37] grace went from Aaron
[49:39] and and from David all the way to
[49:43] Matthew and got a hold of his life. He
[49:46] can tell you his own testimony. I won't
[49:48] tell it tonight.
[49:50] But God got a hold of his
[49:52] life and
[49:55] now such graces in his
[49:58] life. He's become one of my favorite
[50:01] preachers. Yeah, I have favorites.
[50:04] Here's another favorite right here.
[50:05] Brother Matthew
[50:08] Watkins. He looks like my
[50:14] theophony. When I get my body changed,
[50:16] I'm going to be good looking like that.
[50:20] You know what it takes? A lot of grace.
[50:23] A lot of grace. But
[50:25] grace is what we need. The favor of God.
[50:30] I want you to ask God in your seat
[50:32] tonight. Say, "Lord, let your grace
[50:35] smile on me tonight. I need your favor.
[50:37] I need your favor for my life. I I want
[50:40] to leave from the these services a
[50:43] changed person, better than what I was
[50:46] when I came. of burdens lifted, going
[50:49] home
[50:50] free. Free because of grace. Let's
[50:54] worship the Lord together as brother
[50:56] Matthew comes to share his heart.
[51:00] [Music]
[51:04] Say
[51:06] grace, how
[51:08] sweet the
[51:11] sound
[51:17] that I

[53:35] [Music]
[53:42] [Music]
[53:49] sing. Does anybody know about Amazing
[53:51] Grace?
[53:53] How sweet the sound that saved a wretch
[53:56] like me. And aren't you glad just to be
[53:59] gathered together here. But we have the
[54:02] musicians. Let's just bow our
[54:03] head. Lord Jesus, we're just so thankful
[54:06] that we can come once again and be
[54:09] gathered
[54:10] together, Lord, in your
[54:13] presence. Lord, to know that
[54:15] you saw this moment before you even
[54:18] created the heavens of the earth. You
[54:21] looked down through
[54:23] the portals and you said this is going
[54:25] to be the night that I'm going to
[54:27] quicken this seed and I'm going to fill
[54:30] this son and this daughter with the Holy
[54:31] Ghost. They're going to get their
[54:33] questions answered and they'll be
[54:35] delivered and they'll meet me face to
[54:37] face.
[54:38] Lord, we're just looking to you that
[54:40] you'd come. Lord, we just want to be
[54:42] moved out of the way that you could come
[54:44] and just have preeminence now. Lord,
[54:48] many have traveled and no doubt are
[54:50] tired. And there's been great effort and
[54:53] sacrifice that has been put into these
[54:56] meetings and just in getting here. And
[54:59] Lord, we know the adversary is fighting
[55:01] against
[55:02] it. Lord, I'm just asking for a special
[55:04] grace to just come, Lord, and have your
[55:07] will and way in the service
[55:09] now. Lord, I ask that you would just
[55:11] take the bread of life, Lord, and you
[55:12] would break it to your people.
[55:15] I ask it in your name, the Lord Jesus
[55:17] Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you
[55:20] have your Bibles, we'll be reading out
[55:21] of John chapter 16. I just want to thank
[55:24] uh Brother Tim uh for the invitation.
[55:27] It's it's very humbling uh to stand here
[55:30] before you. And Brother Tim has just uh
[55:32] meant so much to me over the years since
[55:35] a young Christian. He's been a true
[55:37] friend and mentor. and he's made himself
[55:39] available to me and and I could just
[55:42] call them and and he would he would
[55:44] answer the phone, you know. It's it's
[55:45] nice when you call somebody and they
[55:47] answer the
[55:48] phone. Well, all
[55:51] right. You know, and he's he's always
[55:53] done that for me and it's it's always
[55:55] meant so much. And brother Tim, just
[55:57] love you and appreciate you and it's
[55:59] just wonderful opportunity to stand with
[56:01] these men of God and to serve with them.
[56:04] Uh my uh you know, I could say a lot,
[56:07] but I might just get emotional. So,
[56:09] let's just get right into the word. But
[56:10] we do bring greetings from our pastor,
[56:12] brother David McGary. And just thankful
[56:14] that my wife and family could be here
[56:16] and and all those that came from our
[56:18] church and supported. We're just so
[56:19] thankful uh to be in fellowship. Amen.
[56:22] Just reading out of John chapter 16.
[56:25] How's everybody feeling?
[56:28] All right. Are you excited?
[56:31] Are you tired?
[56:33] Yeah. That's all right.
[56:35] We're going to have church.
[56:37] Amen. Uh John chapter 16 and verse
[56:41] 20. Let's just read that. It says,
[56:43] "Verily, verily, I say unto you that ye
[56:45] shall weep and lament, but the world
[56:47] shall rejoice and you shall be
[56:49] sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be
[56:51] turned into joy. A woman when she is in
[56:55] travail hath sorrow, because her hour
[56:57] has come. But as soon as she is
[56:59] delivered of the child, she rememberth
[57:01] no more the anguish for joy that a man
[57:04] is born into the world." And ye now
[57:07] therefore have sorrow, but I will see
[57:10] you again, and your heart shall
[57:13] rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from
[57:16] you. And in that day ye shall ask me
[57:19] nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[57:21] whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my
[57:24] name, he will give it to you, hitherto
[57:27] have ye asked nothing in my name. Ask
[57:30] and you shall receive, that your joy may
[57:33] be full. Amen. You may have your seat.
[57:41] Amen. I just want to read this quote out
[57:43] of birth pains here. Uh, brother
[57:45] Brandham would say this and this would
[57:47] be the text that he would use. He says,
[57:48] I believe that Jesus here was speaking
[57:51] of as he said, you will have sorrow but
[57:53] your sorrow shall be turned to joy.
[57:55] speaking to his disciples here, knowing
[57:57] that the birth of Christianity was
[57:59] coming into existence and now the old
[58:02] has to die in order that the new is
[58:05] born. To have anything that gives life
[58:07] has to have pains of distress and they
[58:09] certainly was going to go through the
[58:11] pain of distress and anguish to get from
[58:13] the law unto grace. Normal natural birth
[58:17] types the spiritual birth, right? Normal
[58:20] natural birth types the spiritual birth.
[58:23] All things of the natural is a type of
[58:26] the spiritual. We find out if we look
[58:28] out here on the ground and see a tree in
[58:30] the earth growing. It's struggling for
[58:32] life. That goes to show that there's a
[58:34] tree somewhere that doesn't die because
[58:37] it's crying out for something. And I
[58:39] believe in every single one of us
[58:41] believers, there's something in you that
[58:43] is crying out. We find people no matter
[58:45] how old or how sick, what condition
[58:47] they're crying out to live because it
[58:49] shows there's a life where we live live
[58:53] forever. Yes, sir. Does anybody come
[58:55] here maybe believing for something?
[58:57] Amen. Maybe you have a heart's cry and
[59:00] you're praying for something. You know,
[59:02] the scripture says, "Ask."
[59:04] Amen. And you shall receive that your
[59:06] sorrow. You know, that means your pain,
[59:09] your grief, your annoyance, your
[59:10] affliction shall be turned into joy. Ask
[59:14] and you shall receive that your joy may
[59:16] be full. The prophet of God said he he
[59:19] God promised to supply your needs. Amen.
[59:22] Not your wants,
[59:25] but but he he promised to provide you
[59:27] your needs and not the way that you want
[59:30] it. Come on. You know, I know some of us
[59:34] wanted a certain bunk bed and and you
[59:37] didn't get it and that's just annoying,
[59:40] right? And maybe you you went in early
[59:42] and you put yourself your your all your
[59:44] stuff on the bed cuz you're like, "Man,
[59:46] this is where I want to sleep. There's
[59:47] the there's the plug and I can charge my
[59:49] iPhone and I'm just in business. I'm
[59:52] away from the bathrooms and man, you got
[59:54] here earlier and everybody and you did
[59:56] the right thing. You come in, you're
[59:57] like, "Where's my stuff?" Yeah, that's
[1:00:00] annoying.
[1:00:04] I thought I'd get a bigger amen than
[1:00:05] that. You know what's happened to you?
[1:00:08] You come into the church early. You put
[1:00:09] your Bible down and you go use the
[1:00:11] restroom. You come back and your seat's
[1:00:12] gone.
[1:00:14] Come on. Yeah. Well, maybe you didn't
[1:00:16] need that bunk bed that you thought.
[1:00:19] Maybe God wanted you to witness to
[1:00:21] somebody on the other side of the door.
[1:00:24] You see, sometimes even in the little
[1:00:25] things, we we we get flustered and we
[1:00:27] don't even look to God and say, "God,
[1:00:29] maybe you have a purpose in it." And
[1:00:31] maybe maybe you're wanting to do
[1:00:33] something. I mean, you know, the
[1:00:35] greatest battle ever fought is in your
[1:00:37] mind. And sometimes we let the littlest
[1:00:40] things rob us of our joy. Matter of
[1:00:43] fact, some of you didn't get none
[1:00:44] nothing out of the song service because
[1:00:45] you're still annoyed.
[1:00:48] I didn't want to ride with so in the
[1:00:50] van. I wanted to ride with my other
[1:00:51] friend. I I I requested that ELT would
[1:00:55] have put me with my favorite friend and
[1:00:56] they're not in there. That's the only
[1:00:59] reason I came to this camp.
[1:01:01] Can you believe it? I'm annoyed.
[1:01:05] Hey, that's how the devil starts things
[1:01:07] off.
[1:01:08] Come on. Little things just starting
[1:01:11] sewing little seeds of discrepancies and
[1:01:13] before you know it, he got a storm
[1:01:15] brewing and you don't even know it.
[1:01:16] You're sitting on the song leader.
[1:01:18] You're sitting on the preacher and
[1:01:19] you're a good Hey, you can be filled
[1:01:21] with the Holy Ghost and little things
[1:01:22] like that. All a sudden, you're sitting
[1:01:24] there serious, why am I having such a
[1:01:25] hard time? Cuz the greatest battle you
[1:01:28] ever fight is in your mind.
[1:01:31] Hey, hey, we're we're doing spiritual
[1:01:33] warfare right now.
[1:01:36] You might be You might be having some
[1:01:38] pain. You might be having some some
[1:01:40] grieviances. Yeah.
[1:01:43] That's all right. Stick around a little
[1:01:44] while cuz you got a promise.
[1:01:47] Yeah. That your sorrow, your pain, your
[1:01:50] affliction.
[1:01:52] Your annoyance is going to be turned
[1:01:55] into joy.
[1:01:57] I say, Lord, give me what I need, not
[1:02:00] what I want.
[1:02:02] Yes, sir. See, you might think you need
[1:02:06] something. But really, it might just be
[1:02:08] your want. That's right. That boy or
[1:02:11] that girl, she's just so
[1:02:13] pretty. I just got to marry her. And
[1:02:16] then we find quotes. How'd we get here
[1:02:18] this
[1:02:20] quick? Then we find quotes to support
[1:02:23] our thinking. I'll just die if I can't
[1:02:25] have her. And you leave out all the
[1:02:27] other quotes that if you loved her, if
[1:02:28] she'd be happy with somebody else, you
[1:02:30] just let her go.
[1:02:32] Right? So, we We're in a spiritual
[1:02:33] warfare. And we the weapons of our war
[1:02:36] warfare are not carnal. But they're
[1:02:38] mighty through God of the pulling down
[1:02:40] of strongholds.
[1:02:42] We just don't fight when we go to camp.
[1:02:44] We got to be fighting every day. We got
[1:02:46] to be fighting when we wake up. We got
[1:02:48] to be fighting during lunchtime. We got
[1:02:49] to be fighting at work. We got to be
[1:02:51] fighting at school. We got to be
[1:02:52] fighting when we go to bed. Hey, I even
[1:02:55] pray for God to help me fight when I
[1:02:57] sleep.
[1:02:58] I say, "God, give me a dream. Speak to
[1:03:01] me. Look, if if the devil can haunt
[1:03:03] people in their sleep with nightmares, I
[1:03:05] say, "God, bless me in my sleep, Lord.
[1:03:08] Bless me with dreams. Give me an answer,
[1:03:10] Lord. If there's I'm talking about
[1:03:12] possessing this vessel and
[1:03:14] sanctification and honor.
[1:03:19] Yeah. Give it all to him. Even your
[1:03:20] sleep." You never thought about that,
[1:03:22] did you?
[1:03:25] Hey, God will speak to you. Amen. And if
[1:03:30] anything, the devil's been waring at you
[1:03:32] and causing you to not be able to sleep
[1:03:35] or giving you nightmares and dreams, you
[1:03:37] start committing that to God and your
[1:03:40] sorrow. Yes, sir. And your anger shall
[1:03:42] be turned into joy.
[1:03:46] See, the devil might be filling your
[1:03:47] sleep with those dreams because maybe
[1:03:48] you got a gift in your life and you
[1:03:51] never even thought, you know what? I
[1:03:52] need to surrender this to God. If the
[1:03:55] devil can enter into my sleep and speak
[1:03:57] evil things, Lord, what about the Holy
[1:03:58] Ghost?
[1:04:00] Come on,
[1:04:01] saints. We're in a battle.
[1:04:05] But I say, "Oh, God, give me what I what
[1:04:07] I need." Yes, sir. Not what I I want.
[1:04:11] Yeah. What I need I say, God knows what
[1:04:14] you have need of. And what you have need
[1:04:17] of is his word.
[1:04:19] And when you when your wants can start
[1:04:21] to be his will.
[1:04:23] Let me say when your wants start to
[1:04:25] become his will, then you know you can
[1:04:28] ask.
[1:04:30] Say, "Lord, I'm asking and I see your
[1:04:32] word. I I want the Holy Ghost."
[1:04:35] Hallelujah. And God wants to give it to
[1:04:37] you.
[1:04:40] I need deliverance. God wants to deliver
[1:04:43] you. I need revelation. I need another
[1:04:46] feeling of the Holy. Have you come with
[1:04:47] a need? Yes, sir. Come on. Paul would
[1:04:52] say this in Ephesians 3:14. If you want
[1:04:54] to turn
[1:05:02] there, Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 14.
[1:05:06] I like this. I kind of like to read this
[1:05:08] almost, you know, like a prayer. Paul is
[1:05:11] saying here, for this cause I bow my
[1:05:12] knees under the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:14] Christ, of whom the whole family in
[1:05:17] heaven and in earth his name that he
[1:05:19] would grant you according to the riches
[1:05:21] of his glory to be strengthened with his
[1:05:23] might by his spirit in the inner man
[1:05:25] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:05:27] faith that you being rooted and grounded
[1:05:29] in love. Oh, I like
[1:05:32] that. May be able to comprehend with all
[1:05:34] saints what is the breadth and length
[1:05:36] and depth and height and to know the
[1:05:38] love of Christ which with knowledge that
[1:05:41] ye might be filled with all the fullness
[1:05:43] of God. I mean, my
[1:05:47] I don't know how that works, but I want
[1:05:49] it.
[1:05:51] I don't know how that's going to happen,
[1:05:52] but I want it, Lord. I need that. I need
[1:05:56] Come. I need that because it's in your
[1:05:59] word. I need his word.
[1:06:02] That you might be filled with all the
[1:06:04] fullness of God. Now, unto him that is
[1:06:05] able. Oh my.
[1:06:09] Maybe We can just think on this a minute
[1:06:10] while we start these meetings. Unto him
[1:06:13] that is able
[1:06:15] to do exceedingly
[1:06:17] and abundantly
[1:06:19] above all
[1:06:21] that we ask or think according to the
[1:06:24] power which workketh in us. Now brother
[1:06:27] Brandon would say this and just once
[1:06:28] more Lord he said he is an exhaustable
[1:06:30] fountain of eternal life here tonight to
[1:06:33] make manifest any divine promise of his
[1:06:35] Bible to anybody that'll believe it.
[1:06:38] Amen. The only thing you need to do is
[1:06:40] drink. Come to the fountain and drink.
[1:06:43] Drink until you're satisfied. You can't
[1:06:45] exhaust him. No sir. He is absolutely
[1:06:48] the inexhaustible. And you can just
[1:06:50] drink and drink and drink. You can drink
[1:06:53] your healing in. You can drink your
[1:06:54] salvation in. Just come and drink. Let
[1:06:57] him that's thirsty come and drink. Amen.
[1:07:00] I know he is here.
[1:07:03] I know he is here. And I know, come on,
[1:07:08] he'll do exceedingly abundantly if we'll
[1:07:11] just let him do it. Hey, I think that's
[1:07:15] a good place to start the meetings if
[1:07:17] we'll just let him do it. Look, God
[1:07:21] showed up and he means business. God
[1:07:23] wants to transform lives. God wants to
[1:07:26] show his amazing grace. God wants to
[1:07:28] deliver. God wants to heal. God wants to
[1:07:30] rescue. God wants to answer questions.
[1:07:33] Will you let him do it?
[1:07:38] Yes, Lord. Or are you going to fight?
[1:07:40] Are you going to wrestle?
[1:07:42] All right. Are you gonna allow that one
[1:07:44] to be the critic come into your mind?
[1:07:46] Well, this was said because of that and
[1:07:48] he should say that because he said this
[1:07:50] and he knows that. Hey, why don't you
[1:07:52] just let him do it?
[1:07:56] I say, Lord, let's just let's just all
[1:07:58] of us get out of the way
[1:08:01] and let him do it.
[1:08:03] There's an exhaustable fountain that is
[1:08:05] here tonight. And if you'll just start
[1:08:08] drinking, you can drink in your healing.
[1:08:10] You can drink in your salvation. You can
[1:08:12] drink in your deliverance. You can drink
[1:08:14] in being filled with the Holy Ghost. You
[1:08:16] can drink in questions being answered.
[1:08:18] You can drink in the things that you
[1:08:20] have needed. Oh, if you'll just let him
[1:08:22] do it. I say, "Let's just get out of the
[1:08:24] way and let God have the right away. Get
[1:08:26] out of your thinking. Get out of your
[1:08:28] mind. Get out of your hearts and your
[1:08:30] wants and look into the God, I'm going
[1:08:33] to drink it in.
[1:08:36] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:08:39] His will is his word. Amen. And if
[1:08:42] you'll
[1:08:44] just let him during these meetings, if
[1:08:48] you'll just let him do it. He goes on to
[1:08:50] say this, and this will be the the
[1:08:52] inspiration of what I'm wanting to speak
[1:08:54] on to you now. He says, "We're not
[1:08:55] building," this is Berth Payne's uh he
[1:08:57] says, "We're not building a wall like we
[1:08:59] start off with a Luther's message or
[1:09:01] right down a straight line or a
[1:09:02] Pentecostal message, right? We are
[1:09:04] turning corners. We're building a
[1:09:06] building. God's word is the blueprint.
[1:09:08] Anybody can run a straight line, but it
[1:09:10] takes a mason to turn the corner. It
[1:09:12] takes the power of God to do that. It
[1:09:15] takes an anointed one from heaven to be
[1:09:18] sent down to do that. It has in every
[1:09:20] age. And in the prophets age, the word
[1:09:22] of the Lord comes through those prophets
[1:09:24] and they turn those corners and make
[1:09:26] those differences.
[1:09:28] Now, I'm wanting to just minister by the
[1:09:30] help of God to you on turning the
[1:09:32] corner.
[1:09:34] And if you were to maybe look up into
[1:09:36] Webster's dictionary, what what does
[1:09:37] turning the corner mean? It means uh uh
[1:09:40] turning the corner is to get past the
[1:09:42] most difficult area
[1:09:44] or or or a period in something and begin
[1:09:47] to improve.
[1:09:51] Look, it's okay to have trials.
[1:09:55] Every son that cometh to God, he must be
[1:09:57] tested.
[1:09:59] It's okay to make mistakes. Yes, sir.
[1:10:03] Just stop making the same ones.
[1:10:08] You keep making the same mistakes over
[1:10:10] and over, you're not passing the test.
[1:10:14] Look, Satan wants to condemn you.
[1:10:18] You should be happy that God's letting
[1:10:19] you take the test again.
[1:10:22] Look, there's some examinations and when
[1:10:24] you fail that test, you don't get
[1:10:25] another opportunity. Oh, but I serve a
[1:10:28] God of grace. I serve a God of mercy. If
[1:10:31] you failed the test yesterday, he'll let
[1:10:33] you take it again. If you fail it
[1:10:35] tomorrow, he'll let you take it in cuz
[1:10:37] he knows what he put inside of you. You
[1:10:40] are an overcomer. You can do all things.
[1:10:43] You can believe all things because you
[1:10:45] are predestinated son of God to put
[1:10:47] every devil under your feet no matter
[1:10:50] the test, no matter the trial.
[1:10:54] And if you fail,
[1:10:57] get ready. What do you do when you fail
[1:10:59] a test?
[1:11:02] You study.
[1:11:04] Study to show yourself approved.
[1:11:06] A workman that needeth not be ashamed.
[1:11:10] Some of us are ashamed.
[1:11:13] Reminds me one time my dad told a man
[1:11:14] who had long hair. He said, "Don't you
[1:11:17] know it's a shame for a man to have long
[1:11:18] hair and he said, "I'm
[1:11:23] ashamed." That's all he got out of him.
[1:11:26] But a son of God, he says, "Is that the
[1:11:28] word, Lord? I want to pass the test."
[1:11:31] That's right. Satan wants to condemn
[1:11:34] you. Yeah. You failed the test, but
[1:11:38] God's giving you another opportunity.
[1:11:40] Hey, just like Job, he said, "There's
[1:11:42] none like him."
[1:11:45] Job didn't even know God was sending him
[1:11:47] a test. And I tell you what, a test.
[1:11:49] That's right. A test no man could pass.
[1:11:54] That's true. No man in his right mind
[1:11:56] would say, "Lord, yeah.
[1:11:58] Give me that. I'm a real son of God. Try
[1:12:01] me." No, sir.
[1:12:04] No, you don't want that. And praise God,
[1:12:07] he doesn't give you what you want. He
[1:12:08] gives you what you need.
[1:12:10] cuz some of us have asked for some
[1:12:12] pretty
[1:12:14] dumb things
[1:12:18] and God's grace and his mercy like you
[1:12:22] don't need that.
[1:12:24] Remember brother Brandon talks about the
[1:12:25] boy what happens if your son and my son
[1:12:27] he's 5 years old he come and say daddy
[1:12:29] give me that razor I want to shave too.
[1:12:32] Yeah. Now, I'd be an irresponsible
[1:12:34] father and say, "Well, you're my
[1:12:36] son. Here you
[1:12:38] go. Have at it."
[1:12:41] Yeah. My wife come in, "Honey, what's
[1:12:44] wrong with him? What are you talking
[1:12:46] about? He's all cut up everywhere." Ah,
[1:12:48] he's my son. He can handle it. Well,
[1:12:51] obviously he can't.
[1:12:54] But he got to grow up a little bit. He
[1:12:57] got to get a little bit older. So, some
[1:12:58] of you might be wanting things that it's
[1:13:00] good to want, but it ain't the time or
[1:13:03] it ain't the season.
[1:13:06] Job wasn't up there trying to prove
[1:13:08] something. You better be careful.
[1:13:12] He was serving God and making sacrifice
[1:13:14] for his children, but but there was a
[1:13:16] conversation in heaven and said, "Have
[1:13:17] you considered my servant Job? There's
[1:13:20] none like him in all the earth."
[1:13:23] Now, I'm pretty sure that same
[1:13:25] conversation has went by over the bride
[1:13:27] of Jesus Christ and and and he's tried
[1:13:30] to argue that you've been blessed and
[1:13:31] and you've had this and you that have,
[1:13:33] but let me take it away.
[1:13:36] And you you you're going through some
[1:13:37] great sorrow. You're going through some
[1:13:39] great anguish.
[1:13:41] You got some real hurt, some real
[1:13:43] disappointments.
[1:13:46] Come on. Your heart's been broken. Your
[1:13:48] family's been torn apart. Your church
[1:13:50] has been split up. Your pastors the
[1:13:52] message and you don't know what you're
[1:13:54] going to do.
[1:13:56] But I know somebody that knows.
[1:14:00] God knows exactly what you're going to
[1:14:02] do. You're going to be just like Job.
[1:14:06] Because there's a revelation inside of
[1:14:08] you that can say, "The Lord giveth and
[1:14:11] the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the
[1:14:14] name of the Lord."
[1:14:17] Hallelujah. Even Job didn't know that
[1:14:19] revelation was inside of him.
[1:14:22] But what brought it out? The test.
[1:14:26] The trial.
[1:14:28] Look, brother Brandon went through hard
[1:14:30] trials.
[1:14:31] Sorrow, anguish,
[1:14:33] pain. When he was ready to throw in the
[1:14:36] tell, I don't have time to I don't have
[1:14:38] time to do
[1:14:39] anything. Thought we were thought we
[1:14:41] were going to have some notes to follow,
[1:14:42] but we'll have to see where God goes.
[1:14:46] Brother Brandham got to a place he was
[1:14:48] ready to throw in the towel. Right. Come
[1:14:51] on. He was ready to give up. But he said
[1:14:55] there was an anchor that caught.
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:14:59] Look, we we go through hard times.
[1:15:02] Real trials, real battles, and the fact
[1:15:05] that you're discouraged, the fact that
[1:15:07] you want to give up does not mean you're
[1:15:09] not a son or daughter of God. I curse
[1:15:11] that devil.
[1:15:14] Look, the very prophet of the age,
[1:15:18] if it wasn't for the angel of the Lord,
[1:15:19] what what did that pillar of fire come
[1:15:21] down and say? He said, "Look, don't
[1:15:23] drink or smoke, for I have a specific
[1:15:25] work for you to do when you get older."
[1:15:27] That didn't stop him from trying.
[1:15:30] He tried to smoke. He tried to drink.
[1:15:35] But it was the angel of the Lord that
[1:15:37] kept him from doing it.
[1:15:39] He tried to commit suicide. Not once.
[1:15:42] Yeah. But twice.
[1:15:46] And then the devil tries to tell you you
[1:15:48] ain't got the Holy Ghost because you
[1:15:49] want to commit suicide. Come on. Come
[1:15:52] on. I'm down where you're living right
[1:15:54] now. We go through hard trials. We go
[1:15:56] through hard times. But I'm here to
[1:15:58] declare you're turning the corner.
[1:16:02] You're going to make it. You're going to
[1:16:04] get past the most difficult times you've
[1:16:07] ever gone in your life because you are a
[1:16:09] son of God. You are a daughter of God.
[1:16:12] You are anointed for the job.
[1:16:17] Hell can send every demon and every
[1:16:19] devil, but he can't stop you.
[1:16:24] No sickness, no disease, no weapon
[1:16:27] formed against you shall prosper.
[1:16:30] Take that, you dumb devil.
[1:16:34] You're going to make it. You actually
[1:16:37] already made it.
[1:16:40] I said you already made it.
[1:16:44] Hallelujah.
[1:16:53] You're going to turn the
[1:16:55] corner. It takes a mason to turn the
[1:16:57] corner. It takes the power of God to do
[1:17:00] that. It takes an anointed one from
[1:17:02] heaven to be sent down to do that.
[1:17:05] Look, I I come to this camp believing
[1:17:07] I'm turning the corner. Amen. I've been
[1:17:10] going through one of the greatest trials
[1:17:11] in my
[1:17:13] life. Look, it's good to be open. I've
[1:17:15] been going through one of the greatest
[1:17:17] trials in my life. I don't I feel I
[1:17:20] don't want to preach. I don't want to go
[1:17:21] to church. I don't want to do these
[1:17:23] things. But there's something there.
[1:17:27] I can't give up. And even when I give
[1:17:30] up, there's something there that's
[1:17:32] keeping me.
[1:17:35] Oh, you talk about grace.
[1:17:38] Son, you're going to pass the test.
[1:17:40] Don't worry, son. I never give you more
[1:17:42] than you compare. You're going to pass
[1:17:43] the test because I put a predestinated
[1:17:45] seed on the inside of you.
[1:17:52] David said in Psalms 34, "Many are the
[1:17:56] afflictions of the
[1:17:58] righteous, but the Lord deliverth them
[1:18:02] out of them
[1:18:04] all.
[1:18:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:18:11] Not some. Not the ones only my pastor
[1:18:14] knows about.
[1:18:17] Not the one I've been hiding them. No.
[1:18:18] The God's going to deliver you out of
[1:18:20] them all. That's right.
[1:18:22] He says in Psalms 30:10, he says, "Here,
[1:18:24] oh Lord, and have mercy upon me, Lord.
[1:18:28] Be thou my helper.
[1:18:31] Thou hast turned for me my mourning into
[1:18:34] dancing. Thou hast put off my sackcloth
[1:18:37] and guarded me with gladness. Oh, I see
[1:18:40] church. I have come with an expectation
[1:18:43] during this camp and during these
[1:18:45] meetings. I'm believing for the
[1:18:47] supernatural.
[1:18:50] I'm believing for mourning to be turned
[1:18:52] into dancing. I'm I'm believing for
[1:18:55] people who are sad to become glad. I'm
[1:18:58] believing for people who are in bondage
[1:19:00] to be set free. I'm believing for people
[1:19:02] to be born again and filled with the
[1:19:04] Holy I know what I'm talking about.
[1:19:10] Look, I've sat in these meetings with a
[1:19:12] hard heart. Come on. Come on. Not
[1:19:16] hearing anything the preacher had to
[1:19:18] say.
[1:19:22] But little did I know, there was
[1:19:24] something in me crying out.
[1:19:26] Come on. And
[1:19:29] somehow I was blind that there was an
[1:19:32] inexhaustible fountain. Come on.
[1:19:36] If I would have just let him do it,
[1:19:39] but God's a gentleman.
[1:19:42] He won't force you. No, sir.
[1:19:45] If you want to choose the world, watch
[1:19:47] out.
[1:19:52] My my actions got me to a place I didn't
[1:19:54] want to be.
[1:19:55] Look, I I sat in this camp 30 years ago
[1:19:59] with a hard
[1:20:00] [Music]
[1:20:04] heart. I even did some things I
[1:20:06] shouldn't have been
[1:20:08] doing. Do doing I mean, look, I just say
[1:20:11] it like it is. Look, let's get home
[1:20:12] where we're living. I was out in the
[1:20:14] woods doing
[1:20:16] drugs and my Look, your your actions
[1:20:19] have consequences.
[1:20:21] It doesn't change that you're a son or
[1:20:22] daughter of God.
[1:20:24] It it doesn't it doesn't change that God
[1:20:26] will take his permissive and work it out
[1:20:28] to his perfect. But my actions I I broke
[1:20:31] the rules. So you know what they had to
[1:20:33] do? They had to ask me to leave camp. I
[1:20:34] got kicked out of this camp.
[1:20:38] Yeah, maybe you weren't expecting that,
[1:20:40] but my actions
[1:20:42] had consequences.
[1:20:45] But all the grace of God,
[1:20:50] there was a blood covering over my life.
[1:20:53] No matter how far I went, no matter how
[1:20:56] bad it got, God knew I'd be standing
[1:20:59] here at 2025 preaching to this young
[1:21:02] people. And there was no devil. There
[1:21:05] wasn't no demon. There wasn't no
[1:21:07] suicide. There was no drug. There was no
[1:21:10] car wreck. Come on. There was nothing
[1:21:12] that could stop this predestinated seat
[1:21:15] that is standing here tonight. And Satan
[1:21:18] tried to stop them, but he can't. I said
[1:21:22] Satan's trying to stop you, but he
[1:21:24] can't.
[1:21:26] You are
[1:21:28] predestinated. You are anointed. You are
[1:21:31] the elected. You are the call. I say
[1:21:34] you're turning the
[1:21:36] corner. You're going all the way. You're
[1:21:39] going to get your victory. You're going
[1:21:41] to get your joy. You're going to get the
[1:21:43] Holy Ghost. He's going to turn your
[1:21:45] mourning into dancing, your sadness into
[1:21:48] gladness.
[1:21:51] You're turning the corner.
[1:21:54] Hey, devil. We're turning the corner.
[1:22:00] He takes an anointed one from heaven.
[1:22:03] Amen. And he's here.
[1:22:06] Hallelujah.
[1:22:12] You
[1:22:14] know, I kind of I come to this camp
[1:22:17] expecting

[1:22:25] lot. I'm expecting big things.

[1:22:47] you and say, you know, what are you
[1:22:49] going to have them? You're like, oh my
[1:22:51] goodness. I don't I don't even know what
[1:22:53] they
[1:22:54] have. What What's on the menu? Well, I
[1:22:57] don't know. We We got a pretty big menu.
[1:23:01] I

[1:23:04] whole thing in one sitting, but but just
[1:23:07] open it up and order
[1:23:09] something. You know what I like many
[1:23:12] times? You know, I just have what he's
[1:23:14] having, right? And I you know he he he
[1:23:17] seems to know what he's talking about.
[1:23:19] I'll have what he's having.
[1:23:21] Come on. But you know when my one of my
[1:23:24] favorite recommend recommendations are
[1:23:27] is when you ask the server, I don't
[1:23:29] know. What do you recommend? Yeah. And I
[1:23:31] can't stand it. They say, "Well, some
[1:23:32] people say this is good. Some people say
[1:23:35] that's good."
[1:23:37] I don't want hearsay.
[1:23:40] I don't want no secondhand revelation.
[1:23:43] [Applause]
[1:23:44] Come on. But when that server says, "Let
[1:23:46] me tell you one of my favorite." Come on
[1:23:49] now.
[1:23:51] I really like this one.
[1:23:55] And you're like,
[1:23:56] "Okay. I think I'll have that."
[1:24:00] Come on. Well, come on now. Maybe I'll
[1:24:03] be your server tonight.
[1:24:06] You know what I think you ought to
[1:24:07] order? I think you ought to order the
[1:24:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I think y'all
[1:24:11] order some joy. I think y'all order some
[1:24:14] peace. I think y'all to order some
[1:24:16] grace. Look, I know what I'm talking
[1:24:18] about. I've been living in the grace of
[1:24:22] God all my life. Why don't you go ahead
[1:24:25] and put your order
[1:24:26] in? He's an impossible fountain. Hey,
[1:24:30] you can't order too much for this
[1:24:31] kitchen. He'll keep giving it. He'll You
[1:24:34] put it down. Just drink. Just drink.
[1:24:37] More healing, more Holy Ghost, more
[1:24:39] gladness.
[1:24:41] Hallelujah.
[1:24:47] Well, come on, make up your mind. We all
[1:24:50] already put our order in.
[1:24:53] We just waiting on you now. Come on.
[1:24:55] Come on. We We've been sitting here
[1:24:57] eating chips and salsa for an hour and
[1:24:58] you don't know what you want yet.
[1:25:01] You mean you had a 12-hour drive to
[1:25:03] camp? Come on. You've been sitting on in
[1:25:06] the pre-ervice for an hour and you still
[1:25:09] don't know what you want.
[1:25:11] That's okay. It happens.
[1:25:16] I am the Lord thy God that health you of
[1:25:19] all his diseases.
[1:25:22] Though I walk through the valley of the
[1:25:23] shadow, I will fear no evil.
[1:25:27] Go ahead, put your order in.
[1:25:31] Come on. We come to have
[1:25:33] camp. Yes, sir.
[1:25:36] Quit thinking about the things of the
[1:25:38] world.
[1:25:40] I've been there.
[1:25:42] Could wait for the preacher to get done
[1:25:45] preaching. Maybe. I don't know. Can't
[1:25:48] remember that far back, but I know there
[1:25:50] was another inner man.
[1:25:52] It was always there. Come on.
[1:25:57] It was always there. We got a big God.
[1:26:00] That's right.
[1:26:02] John 14:40 says, "If ye shall ask
[1:26:05] anything in my name, I will do it."
[1:26:06] That's right. Amen. Ask and you shall
[1:26:08] receive that your joy may be full.
[1:26:12] Prophet of God would play like this in
[1:26:13] the resurrection of Lazarus where he'd
[1:26:16] say, "May there be such a joy in the
[1:26:19] camp till every heart will be so
[1:26:22] thrilled till they just don't know where
[1:26:25] they're at or what they're doing.
[1:26:30] God, take us away from the sense bound
[1:26:33] existence. Carry us out there in those
[1:26:36] realms where all things are possible.
[1:26:39] Granted, Lord, repeat us another day of
[1:26:43] Pentecost. Hey, that sounds pretty good
[1:26:44] to me. I'll have what he's having.
[1:26:48] Hey, I I'll order what Malachi 4
[1:26:50] ordered.
[1:26:52] Well, brother Matthew, that was 1951.
[1:26:56] Come on. Oh, you mean the year he was a
[1:26:59] prophet. I got that from your dad.
[1:27:04] People want to ask you, well, when did
[1:27:05] he say it? The year he was a prophet.
[1:27:09] Look, if my prophet said, I pray there'd
[1:27:11] be such a joy in the camp
[1:27:14] where we don't even know where we are or
[1:27:16] what we're doing that we'll be so
[1:27:18] carried away from this sense bound
[1:27:21] existence till all things are possible.
[1:27:23] I say, I'm going to put that in. Let
[1:27:25] there be another day of Pentecost like a
[1:27:27] rushing mighty wind sweep through the
[1:27:29] building and deliver you and fill you
[1:27:32] with the Holy Ghost and turn your
[1:27:36] sorrow, turn your agony into dancing and
[1:27:40] into joy where you can stand up and say,
[1:27:43] "I've turned the corner." Why? It takes
[1:27:46] an anointed one from heaven to do that.
[1:27:48] And that anointed one, the mighty angel,
[1:27:51] has come down.
[1:27:54] Hallelujah.
[1:27:57] Hey, I say try them. Come on. Come on.
[1:28:02] Have you ever been Thank you, Lord. Hey,
[1:28:06] I'm guilty of this. Brother Gary knows
[1:28:08] this. I I like food. So, if I go
[1:28:12] somewhere where I ain't going to be back
[1:28:13] in a while, I have a big problem. I just
[1:28:16] kind of order two or three things. I'd
[1:28:19] like to taste that and I'd like to taste
[1:28:20] that. Gary, what about you? Well, we get
[1:28:22] a little this and a little of
[1:28:24] that. He's looking at
[1:28:26] me. I don't know. And it comes out. I'm
[1:28:28] like, I don't think we're going to be
[1:28:30] able to finish all this, brother Gary. I
[1:28:33] knew
[1:28:34] that. I just wanted to taste a little
[1:28:36] bit of
[1:28:39] everything. Servers looking at you like,
[1:28:41] "What are you doing, man?" Yeah. I want
[1:28:44] a double portion.
[1:28:47] Hey, if you look in your Bible, It looks
[1:28:50] to me like Elisha asked for too much.
[1:28:54] If I was the raft standing on the I
[1:28:56] would have I would have blew my whistle
[1:28:57] and said
[1:28:59] penalty flag. Elisha, are you out of
[1:29:02] your mind?
[1:29:05] Did you He just asked for a double
[1:29:06] portion of what the vindicated prophet
[1:29:08] had. Elisha, come on. You can't do that.
[1:29:12] Well, I don't care what you say. Let me
[1:29:14] ask my father and see what he says.
[1:29:17] My father holds a cattle on a thousand
[1:29:19] hills. He said, "Try me." He said, "Ask
[1:29:22] anything in my name and I will do it."
[1:29:24] So, I think I'll just go ahead and ask.
[1:29:26] I would ask for every one of you to be
[1:29:28] baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:31] I'm going to ask that those spirits of
[1:29:33] lust and those demons of depression
[1:29:35] break off of you and change, fall down
[1:29:38] to the ground. That the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:40] fire sweeps through this building. Oh,
[1:29:43] let it go. Let it go. House of hell,
[1:29:48] give way in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:52] Hey, I'm asking. He's
[1:29:55] here to do for you exceedingly and
[1:30:00] abundantly. More.
[1:30:03] I said more than you can ask or think.
[1:30:06] Hallelujah. Why don't you praise God?
[1:30:09] Why don't you say, "Hey, Lord, I got my
[1:30:11] order in.
[1:30:14] It's on its way. Don't worry. Just a
[1:30:17] couple more minutes. It's coming.
[1:30:21] Hallelujah.
[1:30:25] Elisha asked for a double portion.
[1:30:32] You'll never get that. That's too much.
[1:30:36] Your mom and daddy, they'll never get
[1:30:39] back together. Your daddy's just cross
[1:30:41] the line.
[1:30:44] Yeah, you know that's what you say. But
[1:30:46] you know what? I serve a big God.
[1:30:51] And the only thing that the worst that
[1:30:53] could happen is it don't come the way
[1:30:56] you thought it would. But you know,
[1:30:58] until you get that perfect
[1:30:59] understanding, you stand upon the
[1:31:02] promised word and you don't waver. And
[1:31:04] when you've done all to stand, stand.
[1:31:12] Prophet of God said it like this and
[1:31:15] we're talking about a double portion.
[1:31:17] Hey, I want a double portion. I know
[1:31:18] we've had some good camps. We've had
[1:31:20] some good services, but I I know it's
[1:31:22] just hitting me now. I might be a little
[1:31:24] foolish. I'm asking for a double
[1:31:25] portion.
[1:31:27] Why not? God, send us a double. I need
[1:31:30] more of God. Lord, I need to turn a
[1:31:32] corner. I'm going through a trial in my
[1:31:35] life. Brother Tim said he wants more of
[1:31:37] God. Every one of us want more of God. I
[1:31:39] think God did give me a double portion.
[1:31:44] Brother, you done lost your mind. Okay.
[1:31:45] Well, Brother Bram said what he asked
[1:31:48] for was a perfect type of the church.
[1:31:51] Well, glory.
[1:31:54] He said when they crossed over Jordan,
[1:31:57] he said, "You've asked and what you
[1:32:00] will, and I and I will give it to you."
[1:32:03] Perfect type of the church. All right.
[1:32:04] He said, "I want a double portion of
[1:32:06] your spirit." Yeah.
[1:32:09] Don't be scared to ask. That's right.
[1:32:13] Ask abundantly.
[1:32:15] You have not because I'm trying to start
[1:32:18] some meetings.
[1:32:21] Like I already said, you you hadn't put
[1:32:23] your order in yet. So, we're going to
[1:32:24] take a little time. So, you make up your
[1:32:26] mind. That's all right. Some of us need
[1:32:28] more time. We need a little more grace.
[1:32:29] I needed a whole lot of it.
[1:32:32] Come on. Thank you, brother Tim.
[1:32:36] Come on. And I I want a double portion.
[1:32:40] He said, "Don't be scared to ask. Ask
[1:32:42] abundantly. You have not because you ask
[1:32:44] not. And you ask not because you believe
[1:32:46] not." That's right. Ask. Ask a whole
[1:32:49] lot. Amen. God will give you a whole
[1:32:52] lot.
[1:32:56] Wonderful. Hey, I know it's simple.
[1:32:59] Why don't you start asking?
[1:33:02] Not just a little. Come on.
[1:33:06] Ask a whole lot.
[1:33:09] He'll give you a whole lot.
[1:33:11] Have a lot of faith.
[1:33:14] Don't be scared to ask. Well, brother,
[1:33:16] you don't know what I've gone through.
[1:33:18] You know, my situation's different. See,
[1:33:21] you don't understand what happened with
[1:33:23] mom and daddy. You don't understand what
[1:33:25] happened to me. I got scarred. You know,
[1:33:27] I was doing the right thing, but a boy
[1:33:28] took advantage of me. And now, now I
[1:33:30] feel unwanted. And the devil's he's
[1:33:32] making me self-conscious like like no
[1:33:34] one's ever going to I rebuke that
[1:33:36] spirit.
[1:33:39] That's right. That's what Satan wants to
[1:33:41] do.
[1:33:44] He wants to put all these things on you.
[1:33:49] The greatest battle ever fought in your
[1:33:50] mind.
[1:33:53] And what happens? You start living below
[1:33:55] your privileges. Well, maybe I'm
[1:33:57] unworthy. Maybe it's just going to be
[1:33:59] like this. my whole life. Maybe it's
[1:34:02] never I've gone through the prayer line
[1:34:03] and and I've gone up to the altar and
[1:34:05] I've done this and that and well, you're
[1:34:07] going to give up now. Come on. God
[1:34:09] didn't give up on you.
[1:34:12] Hallelujah. You didn't think you can
[1:34:13] make another camp, but here you are.
[1:34:17] Maybe you've come up against the same
[1:34:18] test over and over again. And this time
[1:34:20] you're wondering, well, I just I'm going
[1:34:22] to be embarrassed if I go up. I'm going
[1:34:23] to be embarrassed if I do this again.
[1:34:24] I'm going to be embarrassed. No, you a
[1:34:27] forget about everybody else around you.
[1:34:29] Amen. I pray there'll be a double
[1:34:31] portion that so overwhelm you. You won't
[1:34:33] even know where you're at and what
[1:34:34] you'll do. You'll be so pulled far away
[1:34:37] from this sound existence. You'll be
[1:34:39] caught into a heavenly realm where all
[1:34:41] things are possible. Oh, you'll be born
[1:34:43] again. You'll be changed. You'll be a
[1:34:46] new creature. All things pass away. All
[1:34:48] things become new. Your past is no
[1:34:50] longer a bondage. Your past becomes your
[1:34:53] testimony.
[1:34:54] Hey, I'm talking about the grace of God.
[1:34:56] I know what I'm talking about. What
[1:34:59] about that woman at the well? When the
[1:35:01] word discerned the thought intent of her
[1:35:02] heart, she ran back into the city and
[1:35:04] said, "Come see a man who told me all
[1:35:07] the things that I done." Her past became
[1:35:09] her testimony. Hey, that's what I call
[1:35:12] turning a corner. And somebody here,
[1:35:14] your past which has condemned you is
[1:35:17] going to be your testimony.
[1:35:21] Amen. Wonderful. Don't be scared to ask.
[1:35:26] Ask a whole lot.
[1:35:28] Brother Brandon would go on and this
[1:35:31] quote talking about how he was riding
[1:35:32] with a man and he
[1:35:35] said, "You know, I was driving a a Ford
[1:35:38] and God give me faith for a Buick." He
[1:35:41] said, "I got Buick faith now." He said,
[1:35:44] "Now I'm praying for Cadillac
[1:35:47] faith." He said, "All right, that that's
[1:35:49] good. That's right. Keep on. What you
[1:35:52] believe, hold on to it. God will give
[1:35:54] it. He's got Ford faith. just stay with
[1:35:57] a forward then that's all right let's
[1:36:01] get a little more faith
[1:36:04] you know I shared that with my wife and
[1:36:06] you know she quit back at me she said I
[1:36:08] guess I guess I got Ford faith you know
[1:36:12] we drive Fords and I kind of thought
[1:36:14] about it I said that's kind of right you
[1:36:16] know that's what I bought
[1:36:19] her that's what I gave her I gave her a
[1:36:23] Ford but our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:36:25] Christ didn't give you a the Lord.
[1:36:28] He purchased justification for you. But
[1:36:31] he didn't leave you in justification.
[1:36:34] If you're still driving justification,
[1:36:35] it's just because you ain't got out and
[1:36:37] got into the other car he already gave
[1:36:38] you.
[1:36:41] He done gave you sanctification.
[1:36:43] He done gave you the restoration of the
[1:36:45] gifts. If that's all he gave, then that
[1:36:48] then then I wouldn't be mad at you. But
[1:36:50] he's given you so much more.
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:58] Come on.
[1:37:01] Prophet God said we got that plus until
[1:37:04] Jesus Christ is made manifest in the
[1:37:06] fullness of his power as he promised to
[1:37:09] do in these last days.
[1:37:12] When when's that?
[1:37:15] Tomorrow. It was yesterday when the
[1:37:17] prophet was here. No, not tomorrow. Not
[1:37:20] yesterday. Not tomorrow.
[1:37:22] Today. That's right. Tonight, this camp,
[1:37:26] these meetings,
[1:37:28] prophet of God said this. He said, "God
[1:37:31] is able this morning to send in our
[1:37:32] midst of the Holy Ghost. He's able to
[1:37:34] send the power to heal the sick, to save
[1:37:36] the lost, and do anything that he has
[1:37:38] spoken to do so. He is able of these
[1:37:40] stones, said John's children unto
[1:37:42] Abraham." And a true messenger from God
[1:37:44] believes that he and he holds on to that
[1:37:46] Jehovah Gyra. God will provide. When God
[1:37:49] says
[1:37:51] anything, how's it going to happen,
[1:37:54] Brother
[1:37:55] Brandham? Now, see, we got it all worked
[1:37:57] up in our mind.
[1:38:00] When God says anything, how's it going
[1:38:02] to happen, Brother Brand? I don't know.
[1:38:05] It's none of your business to know. God
[1:38:08] will provide it. God will provide for
[1:38:10] himself. Look, Jesus Christ is here to
[1:38:13] manifest himself in the fullness of his
[1:38:15] power. How is he going to do it? I don't
[1:38:18] know. But I want to tell you, I want to
[1:38:19] let them do it. I don't want to be the
[1:38:21] critic. I don't want to sit over here.
[1:38:23] Well, that one done this and that one
[1:38:25] done that and they're just waiting for
[1:38:26] their queue and they're waiting for
[1:38:28] that, hey, I ain't going to be that guy
[1:38:30] because I've experienced the grace of
[1:38:32] almighty God. And I just want to put my
[1:38:34] shoulder with yours and say, "Oh, God,
[1:38:35] if you're going to give us a double
[1:38:37] portion, I don't know how you're going
[1:38:39] to do it, but I just want to let him do
[1:38:41] it. I'm going to drink in drink in. I'm
[1:38:44] going to drink in my healing. I'm gonna
[1:38:46] drink in my deliverance.
[1:38:48] [Music]
[1:38:50] Hallelujah.
[1:38:51] Prophet of God said it like this in a
[1:38:54] countdown. We won't try to hold you too
[1:38:56] long on the first night. Y'all ready for
[1:38:58] the home stretch? Let's go. I know
[1:39:01] you're tired.
[1:39:04] Some of you are going to start sleep
[1:39:05] seeking God by dream right here in the
[1:39:07] service. Brother, I asked for God to
[1:39:10] bless me in my dreams and he's doing it
[1:39:12] right now. Like you
[1:39:13] said, don't get mad at me. I asked God
[1:39:16] to speak to me in dreams, brother. Just
[1:39:18] leave me
[1:39:19] alone. Well, hey. All right. Just tell
[1:39:22] me what he told you.
[1:39:28] Hey, he said wake up. That's right,
[1:39:31] brother Joe. That's what we need. We
[1:39:33] need a good waking up. We need a good
[1:39:36] shaking. Maybe some of us have gotten
[1:39:38] too comfortable that it's just another
[1:39:40] good camp service and it's going to lull
[1:39:42] you to sleep and you're just waiting for
[1:39:43] I say we need a good waking up. We need
[1:39:45] a good shaking to recognize the mighty
[1:39:48] angel is in the building. The anointed
[1:39:50] one from heaven has come down to meet
[1:39:53] your needs. He's come down to give you
[1:39:56] your order. He's come down to give you a
[1:39:59] double portion. He's come down to turn
[1:40:02] your murd into dancing. He's come down
[1:40:05] to in the corner.
[1:40:10] Wake up.
[1:40:14] Prophet of God said, "It's come to the
[1:40:16] age of astronaut." Yes, sir. We have
[1:40:18] moved out of the airplane age.
[1:40:20] Hallelujah. We've got more power now.
[1:40:23] The astron age has come in.
[1:40:26] Where is it? Right here.
[1:40:31] What is it? We've come into a spiritual
[1:40:34] age of astronauts. See, going above,
[1:40:37] it's the same spirit. Only more power.
[1:40:41] All right. Only lift higher can go
[1:40:43] higher and more, believe more, be more
[1:40:46] like Christ. Look, God ain't done. We're
[1:40:48] still going higher.
[1:40:50] We going to go higher than the last
[1:40:52] camp. And if we stay here, we'll go
[1:40:54] higher in the next camp. We're going to
[1:40:56] be just like Enoch. I'm going to keep
[1:40:58] going higher and higher and higher till
[1:41:00] one of these days, I'm going to take a
[1:41:02] step and I'm going to be gone. I to be
[1:41:04] so high God's gonna say, "Son, don't go
[1:41:06] back anymore. Just come on right into
[1:41:08] the body change."
[1:41:11] We are a generation of astronauts.
[1:41:15] Hey, I like that. You were born to be up
[1:41:18] there.
[1:41:23] It's the same spirit, only more power.
[1:41:25] Same spirit, not a different spirit. I
[1:41:28] don't know how some people can't see
[1:41:29] that. Come on. Only more power. Only
[1:41:32] lifted higher. Can go higher. See more.
[1:41:35] Believe more. Be more like Christ. Not
[1:41:37] the automobile. Come on. Sorry honey. I
[1:41:39] gave you a Ford.
[1:41:43] Not a horse and buggy. Come on. I'd give
[1:41:46] you an airplane if I
[1:41:48] could. But our Lord and Savior gave you
[1:41:52] a spaceship.
[1:41:56] Hey, you got a theophony.
[1:42:00] You can travel like a thought.
[1:42:03] You are born for it.
[1:42:06] Not even airplane but an astronaut. He
[1:42:08] sweeps on and above each one. I say God
[1:42:11] gave us astronaut faith during these
[1:42:13] meetings. That there's no limit.
[1:42:18] That there's no limit to what God can do
[1:42:20] in these meetings.
[1:42:23] That's right.
[1:42:25] Malachi 4 didn't come to put the limits
[1:42:27] on. That's right. Other men have tried
[1:42:29] to put the limits on,
[1:42:32] tried to say you can't have this and you
[1:42:34] can't have. But my prophet come to take
[1:42:36] the limits off. My prophet said you're
[1:42:38] an astronaut.
[1:42:40] You can have it all. There are no limits
[1:42:43] to what God can do.
[1:42:49] Remember, he's an impossible fountain.
[1:42:53] Let's just start drinking it in.
[1:42:55] drinking it in. Ask.
[1:43:00] I'm about Have you Have you finally come
[1:43:03] up with your order?
[1:43:06] Come on. Are we getting there?
[1:43:08] There comes a time where the chips and
[1:43:10] salsa, they just You can't eat anymore.
[1:43:13] You finally got to get you got to
[1:43:14] finally put your order in.
[1:43:18] You know what I'm talking about, right?
[1:43:21] Finally comes the time. All right, you
[1:43:22] know what? I This is what I want. I
[1:43:24] said, 'Let start having an expectation
[1:43:26] in these meetings. Let's start having an
[1:43:28] expect expectation. God, I'm going to
[1:43:30] turn the corner.
[1:43:33] I like how brother Brandham said, "If
[1:43:34] you'll only believe just astronaut once,
[1:43:37] get away from that automobile and
[1:43:39] airplane. Let's go on till all things
[1:43:42] are possible."
[1:43:45] Look, I ain't talking about a one-time
[1:43:47] experience.
[1:43:49] I'm talking about meeting Jesus Christ
[1:43:51] face to face
[1:43:54] where you're changed.
[1:43:56] Old things pass away.
[1:43:59] All things I said all things become new.
[1:44:03] You ain't got to go be spotted in the
[1:44:05] world to experience that.
[1:44:08] Don't let the devil lie to you. Well, if
[1:44:10] you just knew what it was like, then you
[1:44:12] could have the contrast. You don't want
[1:44:13] that contrast. You don't want them
[1:44:15] marks. You don't want those scars. I I I
[1:44:17] tell you in the name of the Lord, you
[1:44:19] don't want to go out there. Amen. I've
[1:44:22] been there. It's dark. It's ugly. It'll
[1:44:25] take you further than you want to go.
[1:44:27] But oh, if you've gone there, we serve a
[1:44:30] God who's rich in mercy.
[1:44:34] I don't care how far you've gone. He'll
[1:44:36] turn the corner for you.
[1:44:42] You don't got to terry all night.
[1:44:45] You don't have to wait till you get back
[1:44:46] home.
[1:44:51] Brother Banner said, "If you want the
[1:44:52] Holy Ghost, he can fall on you right
[1:44:53] now."
[1:44:59] How's it going to happen? I don't
[1:45:01] know. But I know my Bible said, "While
[1:45:03] Peter yet spake these words, the Holy
[1:45:06] Ghost fell on all them that heard the
[1:45:08] word." If you put your order in, then
[1:45:10] hey, I'm looking for it. I asked for it.
[1:45:12] I'm looking for it. Oh, God said that a
[1:45:15] great Jehovah eagle. He's right now
[1:45:17] flying around the building. You want it,
[1:45:19] I'll give it. You want it, I'll give it.
[1:45:21] Why don't you just let him do it? Get
[1:45:23] over your disappointments. Get over
[1:45:26] being upset. I know you didn't get the
[1:45:27] dorm bed you wanted. I know your iPhone
[1:45:29] charger's broke and it ain't working and
[1:45:31] you're not going to be able to text Joey
[1:45:33] back home and you're just all been up.
[1:45:35] Maybe God did that for a reason because
[1:45:37] he wanted to get your attention. But
[1:45:40] what is he going to do? Your annoyance.
[1:45:43] your dissatisfaction.
[1:45:46] You're you're upset over something, but
[1:45:48] the Holy Ghost is here to turn that
[1:45:52] into a blessing.
[1:45:57] That's what I'm believing for.
[1:46:00] Why these men of God preach the word,
[1:46:03] there's going to be such an atmosphere
[1:46:04] of faith
[1:46:08] that we're not limited, church. Amen.
[1:46:12] Look, if if if you can believe it, if
[1:46:15] you can ask for it, if you can believe
[1:46:16] it, you can have it.
[1:46:19] Ask abundantly,
[1:46:22] God will do exceedingly and abundantly
[1:46:24] above what you could think or ask.
[1:46:31] Maybe we'll just work towards a
[1:46:35] close. You don't have to settle for a
[1:46:37] portion.
[1:46:40] You can have it all. Amen.
[1:46:43] Look, it it doesn't take some
[1:46:45] process. You don't have to terry and oh,
[1:46:48] I better go make this right. Look, I
[1:46:49] know what I'm talking
[1:46:52] about. I've been
[1:46:54] there. We're preaching on turning the
[1:46:57] corner.
[1:47:01] Look, I know the prophet was framing
[1:47:02] that to the age of coming out of one
[1:47:05] dispa dispensation and entering into an
[1:47:07] eagle age, an astronaut age, a pride
[1:47:09] age.
[1:47:11] But if you don't follow the Malachi 4:5,
[1:47:13] you're going to be just uh left grobing
[1:47:16] around and Lady will see you.
[1:47:19] Pick your make your choice.
[1:47:22] Lady will see us. All all of its wants
[1:47:24] and all of its pleasures all still
[1:47:25] available if you want it.
[1:47:28] But there's an inexhaustible fountain
[1:47:30] available to you.
[1:47:35] I'm talking to somebody here's in a hard
[1:47:37] spot.
[1:47:40] Somebody here wants more of God.
[1:47:44] Somebody wants the Holy Ghost. Somebody
[1:47:45] needs an anointed one from heaven to
[1:47:48] come down and touch their family
[1:47:52] and change the situation. Amen. Come on.
[1:47:55] and turn the corner.
[1:47:59] You say, "Brother Matthew, me?" Yeah.
[1:48:02] Would God do it for me? Yeah. Why do you
[1:48:05] think he's trying to tell you that right
[1:48:06] now?
[1:48:08] Don't you realize all the stories in the
[1:48:10] Bible, all the patriarchs are just
[1:48:12] examples to you.
[1:48:14] To let you know what God did for them,
[1:48:17] he'll do for you.
[1:48:19] You would have thought Moses would have
[1:48:20] had it all figured out.
[1:48:23] He was just set up just right. He
[1:48:26] thought he knew how he would do it. What
[1:48:29] did it take him? It took him 40 years on
[1:48:30] the back side of the desert.
[1:48:33] But what happened? There'll come a
[1:48:37] day where he met the pillar of fire.
[1:48:42] And he turned the corner.
[1:48:44] What seemed like something impossible to
[1:48:47] do, I'm past my strength. I'm past my
[1:48:50] youth.
[1:48:52] How could I ever fulfill the promise?
[1:48:54] Now,
[1:48:56] just meet the logos.
[1:48:59] God God, you know, God likes it to get
[1:49:01] where it's impossible.
[1:49:04] He likes it to get to a place where you
[1:49:06] finally say, "I can't do it." And then
[1:49:10] he's just They're saying, "Man, I've
[1:49:12] been waiting for this a long time. You
[1:49:14] could have just made it a whole lot
[1:49:15] easier last camp. Come on now. You could
[1:49:18] have made it a whole lot easier last
[1:49:20] time your pastor was preaching on
[1:49:21] Sunday. You could have made it a whole
[1:49:23] lot easier when your mom came over to
[1:49:24] you and said, "You know what you're
[1:49:26] doing ain't right." You could have said,
[1:49:27] "You know what, Mom? I'm sorry. I
[1:49:28] repent." Hey, you could have got the
[1:49:30] Holy Ghost right there.
[1:49:33] Come on. Hey, we we we would save God
[1:49:35] and ourselves a whole lot of problem if
[1:49:37] we just let him do it. That's right.
[1:49:40] But, you know, it got to the place where
[1:49:42] Moses got out there and he met the the
[1:49:43] the pillar of fire. He turned the
[1:49:45] corner. What about Paul?
[1:49:49] Paul Paul was going the wrong way.
[1:49:52] And he thought he was doing the right
[1:49:54] thing.
[1:49:56] But what happened? Anointed one from
[1:49:58] heaven come down.
[1:50:00] G and struck him down. He said, "Saul,
[1:50:03] it's hard to kick against the pricks."
[1:50:06] You wonder why you feel that in your
[1:50:08] heart? It's hard to kick against the
[1:50:09] word of God. It's hard to fight against
[1:50:12] what you've been called to. That's
[1:50:14] right. Yeah. He said, "Lord, who are
[1:50:17] you?" He said, "I'm Jesus."
[1:50:20] What did it take an anointed one from
[1:50:22] heaven?
[1:50:25] It's no
[1:50:26] different. It's no
[1:50:28] different. You think, could God do that?
[1:50:31] He's come to do it.
[1:50:35] You say, "Brother M, yeah, I know what
[1:50:36] I'm talking about.
[1:50:38] I I could take time to tell you my
[1:50:40] testimony, but there came a time in my
[1:50:42] life where I got to such a
[1:50:46] place where I I wanted to give up the
[1:50:49] things of the world, but I was in such
[1:50:51] bondage
[1:50:53] that even when I wanted to give it up, I
[1:50:55] couldn't. There was another spirit.
[1:50:58] There is another nature there saying,
[1:51:00] "You can't give it up."
[1:51:03] And it was right cuz I tried to. And I
[1:51:07] knew it had control over me. Come on.
[1:51:10] And no matter how hard I would try over
[1:51:14] and over, I would never get free. But
[1:51:16] little did I know,
[1:51:19] God was just waiting for me
[1:51:23] to say, "Lord, whatever that is, it's
[1:51:25] bigger than me, and I need your help."
[1:51:29] And the same God that met Moses, the
[1:51:32] same God that met Paul, the same God
[1:51:35] that met William Brandon, the same God
[1:51:37] that met my brother David, the same God
[1:51:39] that met my brother Aaron, the same God
[1:51:41] came down and he got a hold of me. An
[1:51:44] anointed one came down from heaven and I
[1:51:47] turned the corner and I've never been
[1:51:49] the same. I said, I've never been the
[1:51:52] same. I've been Hey, He turned my
[1:51:55] morning into dancing. You wonder why
[1:51:57] Crazy. I was crazy for the world. You
[1:52:00] better re get real. I'll be crazy for my
[1:52:03] Lord. There's no one higher. There's no
[1:52:05] one greater. There's no other name than
[1:52:08] the name of Jesus. Every demon shall
[1:52:10] pow. Every knee shall pow at the name of
[1:52:13] Jesus. I will lift them up. I will lift
[1:52:16] them higher. I will give him all the
[1:52:18] praise. I'll give him all the glor.
[1:52:20] Lord, you're worthy.
[1:52:22] That the musicians would come. Oh, I say
[1:52:24] he's worthy,
[1:52:26] church. Why don't we all stand?
[1:52:33] I just want to take this
[1:52:36] moment to give somebody a chance.
[1:52:40] Hallelujah.
[1:52:48] Maybe you had to fight and claw to get
[1:52:51] here and all hell was trying to stop you
[1:52:54] from getting here.
[1:52:58] But you made it,
[1:53:02] brother Ryan. You made it.
[1:53:04] The devil said, The devil said you
[1:53:06] couldn't be here, but you made it. The
[1:53:10] devil tried to stop me from getting
[1:53:11] here, but I made it. The devil tried to
[1:53:14] stop you, but you made it.
[1:53:19] Cuz God has something in store.
[1:53:24] Maybe with every head
[1:53:30] bowed. Is there somebody here
[1:53:33] that Look, I I mean, let God deal with
[1:53:37] your
[1:53:39] heart. You You really need to turn the
[1:53:42] corner. You're going through a difficult
[1:53:47] time. You don't need a pep talk.
[1:53:50] You don't need somebody to tell you
[1:53:52] you're doing
[1:53:53] good. You need a face-to-face conference
[1:53:57] with Almighty
[1:53:58] God. But you know, a new birth is a
[1:54:01] struggle. It's a
[1:54:05] pain. It's a stress. There's some dying
[1:54:09] out you got to
[1:54:11] do. There's some repenting you got to
[1:54:14] do.
[1:54:16] There's some anguish. You got to say,
[1:54:17] "God, I I realize I'm
[1:54:23] wrong." And you need that anointed one
[1:54:25] from heaven to come
[1:54:30] down. Yeah. I'm talking about the same
[1:54:33] one that came to Moses.
[1:54:38] friends. There's nothing like
[1:54:41] it when he moves up next to you and puts
[1:54:44] his arms around
[1:54:46] you. I know what it's like when you're
[1:54:50] carried away from this sense
[1:54:53] existence and you're in a a heavenly
[1:54:56] place. You don't know where you
[1:54:59] are. There's so much love. There's so
[1:55:02] much peace.
[1:55:05] and he starts putting that that salmon
[1:55:07] and balm on your heart.
[1:55:10] And he starts to tell you, "Son, it's
[1:55:12] going to be okay. I know you're
[1:55:16] hurting. I know you've been doing all
[1:55:18] you can do to stand, but I'm here
[1:55:23] now." There's somebody that wants to
[1:55:25] lift up your say, "God, I need that.
[1:55:29] I've been trying so hard for this, Lord,
[1:55:33] but I just want to let you do it
[1:55:36] now. I've tried to to do this and do
[1:55:40] that, but I seem to come up to the same
[1:55:44] things over and over, and I feel like I
[1:55:46] never get the victory, Lord. But I'm
[1:55:48] just going to
[1:55:49] say, Lord, I want you to
[1:55:52] come. I'm going to let you do it, Lord.
[1:55:54] You said you're an exhaustable fountain.
[1:55:58] Lord, I want the Holy Ghost. I want to
[1:56:00] be
[1:56:02] delivered. Lord, I want to meet that
[1:56:04] anointed one. There's somebody that
[1:56:06] wants to lift up their
[1:56:09] hand. Say, "God, I want the Holy
[1:56:11] [Music]
[1:56:13] Ghost." Maybe you're going through a
[1:56:15] really hard time in your
[1:56:18] life. You say, "God, I want to turn the
[1:56:21] corner right now. There's an altar here
[1:56:24] for you.
[1:56:28] You You don't need a man to pray for
[1:56:30] you. You You don't need me to come. I'm
[1:56:34] happy to do it. But God will come. An
[1:56:37] anointed one from heaven will
[1:56:39] come. And that
[1:56:43] sorrow, that pain, that annoyance, that
[1:56:47] hurt, those
[1:56:51] disappointments, that anointing will
[1:56:53] settle over you.
[1:56:57] and all of those things will just start
[1:56:59] to melt in his presence.
[1:57:05] Why don't you welcome him
[1:57:08] now? The altar's open. We're happy to
[1:57:10] pray for
[1:57:11] [Music]

[2:28:08] bless you tonight. If you'd like to stay

[2:28:24] don't know where you're sleeping at,

[2:28:44] Father, we're so thankful, Lord.
[2:28:47] So thankful, Father, for the word we've
[2:28:49] heard tonight, the presence of God. We
[2:28:52] ask, Lord, that you'll just return
[2:28:54] strength unto our brother. Lord, the
[2:28:57] service he's given unto you. Give us
[2:29:00] rest for our bodies tonight. Touch us,
[2:29:02] Lord. We
[2:29:03] pray, Lord, be in each cabin, each dorm
[2:29:06] room. Father, may your presence just
[2:29:08] abide, Lord, with us. We ask, Lord, for
[2:29:11] your glory and for your honor. We ask
[2:29:14] Lord that you'd go with each one as they
[2:29:16] travel to a motel or wherever. Give
[2:29:17] traveling mercies. Bring us back
[2:29:19] according to the right time in the
[2:29:21] morning. We pray together and worship
[2:29:23] you once. We love you father in Jesus
[2:29:28] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can
[2:29:32] be dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:29:40] All my life you have been
[2:29:47] faithful. All my life you have been so
[2:29:52] stronger.
[2:29:56] Every breath that I am
[2:30:00] [Music]
[2:30:01] able, I will speak of
