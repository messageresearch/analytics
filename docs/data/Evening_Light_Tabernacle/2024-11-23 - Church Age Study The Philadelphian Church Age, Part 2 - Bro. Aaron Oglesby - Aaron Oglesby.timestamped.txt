[14:35] together here on a Friday night for for
[14:37] another church age study and and we're
[14:39] going to start by reading here in the in
[14:41] the Book of Revelation the third chapter
[14:45] and the seventh verse and we're going to
[14:46] get right into it we're on the second
[14:49] part of the Philadelphian Church age in
[14:51] the first eight or nine slides or so
[14:54] what we're going to do is we'll just
[14:55] recap and review what we've already
[14:57] covered of this age before before we get
[14:59] into uh new material as it were tonight
[15:03] so Revelations 3: 7 and we'll read down
[15:09] through
[15:10] 13 says unto the angel of the Church of
[15:12] the Philadelphia write these things
[15:14] sayith he that is Holy he that is true
[15:18] he that hath the Key of David he that
[15:20] openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth
[15:23] and no man openeth says I Know Thy Works
[15:27] behold I have set before thee an open
[15:30] door and no man can shut it for thou
[15:33] Hast a little strength and H has kept my
[15:35] word and has not denied my name behold I
[15:38] will make them of the synagogue of Satan
[15:41] which say they are Jews and are not but
[15:43] do lie behold I will make them to come
[15:46] in worship before thy feet and to know
[15:49] that I have loved
[15:52] thee because thou Hast kept the word of
[15:54] my patience I also will keep thee from
[15:57] the hour of Temptation which shall come
[15:59] upon all the world to try them that
[16:01] dwell upon the Earth behold I come
[16:04] quickly hold that fast which thou Hast
[16:07] that no man take thy crown him that
[16:10] overcometh will I make a pillar in the
[16:12] temple of my God and he shall go no more
[16:14] out and I will write upon him the name
[16:17] of my God and the name of the city of my
[16:20] God which is New Jerusalem which cometh
[16:22] down out of Heaven from my God and I
[16:25] will write upon him my new name he that
[16:28] hath a he let him hear what the spirit
[16:31] saith unto the churches amen I pray that
[16:34] the Lord will add us blessing to the
[16:35] reading of the word as you take your
[16:37] seats
[16:41] tonight amen before we get into it and
[16:44] as we get into it we I want to start
[16:46] right here and it's a slide you've seen
[16:48] every single time we've done a church
[16:50] age
[16:51] study and the quote here brother Brown
[16:54] says it is the key is the Revelation
[16:57] that God never changes is and that his
[17:00] ways are as unchangeable as he is
[17:03] Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same
[17:06] yesterday today and forever and I know
[17:09] like I said every time we have a church
[17:10] a study I show this slide I go over this
[17:13] point and we always will because this is
[17:16] at the core of the whole Bible this is
[17:18] at the core of of everything that we
[17:20] believe this scripture Hebrews 13:8 was
[17:23] was the very theme of brother bram's
[17:25] Ministry because it was at the the core
[17:27] of what he believed and that what he did
[17:29] at the beginning is what he's going to
[17:31] do at the end how he acted one way is
[17:33] how he's going to act again so if he
[17:35] healed before he'll heal again and if he
[17:37] saved before he'll save again if if he
[17:39] was against something 2,000 years ago
[17:42] he's against it now he he never changes
[17:44] his ways are unchangeable brother
[17:47] brandom says it's the Keystone of the
[17:49] whole Bible amen that God does not
[17:53] change and I'm thankful tonight for that
[17:55] and we can rest in that tonight knowing
[17:57] that his promises are as sure tonight as
[17:59] they've ever been if he gave the Holy
[18:02] Ghost before he'll give it to you
[18:04] tonight and on the exact same grounds
[18:07] that he gave it before Jesus Christ is
[18:10] the same yesterday today and forever and
[18:13] and we're studying here in the
[18:14] Philadelphian age or the sixth Age and
[18:17] and and if you see here on the map just
[18:19] to place it we're looking here at Asia
[18:21] Minor and we've gone around the map
[18:23] starting in the bottom left at Ephesus
[18:25] then Smyrna and pergamon thyra Sardis
[18:28] and we've come to Philadelphia it is
[18:30] known as the age of Brotherly Love and
[18:32] it lasted from around
[18:34] 1750 up to around
[18:38] 1906 and and the messenger we spent a
[18:40] lot of time talking about the messenger
[18:42] when we covered this the first time
[18:43] because because John Wesley truly was a
[18:47] a a a phenomenal man and some of the
[18:49] things that he did was was just
[18:51] incredible but he lived from 1703 to
[18:54] 1791 he was one of 19 children if you
[18:59] got a problem getting along with your
[19:00] one or two siblings you'd have had
[19:03] trouble in this house one of 19 children
[19:06] and and I just had a few facts in there
[19:08] he rode
[19:09] 4,500 miles a year on a
[19:13] horse and his lifetime he preached more
[19:16] than 40,000 sermons and and I said this
[19:19] last time that's really impressive to me
[19:20] because I think I'm around a
[19:23] hundred so I'm not going to get there
[19:26] okay I'm not going to get to 40,000 no
[19:28] matter what I do because his ministry
[19:30] was like 50 years long and he preached
[19:33] four or five times a day for the
[19:35] entirety of it brother brandham said he
[19:37] preached something like 880,000
[19:39] sermons it was a no 40,000 sermons I'm
[19:43] sorry 40,000 sermons in his lifetime
[19:45] brother Bram says that John Wesley says
[19:48] of himself he could not remember to have
[19:51] felt lowness of spirits for even a
[19:53] quarter of an hour since he was born
[19:57] that's pretty incredible statement I I I
[19:59] couldn't make that statement about last
[20:01] week now imagine riding a horse non-stop
[20:04] through bad weather and getting attacked
[20:06] we talked about him attacking him and
[20:08] trying to kill him and stoning and
[20:10] sticks and turning Bulls loose in his
[20:12] meeting he never got upset about it and
[20:15] and and I don't know how realistic that
[20:17] is for me but I do want to be more like
[20:19] that I would love to get to a place to
[20:21] where to where you know we don't up and
[20:23] down according to the to to the
[20:25] struggles of life because we have a
[20:26] promise we have a god understand that
[20:29] life gets difficult but I feel like the
[20:31] reason he was the way he was is he was
[20:34] so anchored in the promise that it
[20:36] didn't matter if it was a good day or a
[20:38] bad day or or today didn't go the way I
[20:40] wanted it to or the service didn't go
[20:42] the way I expected it to he was anchored
[20:44] in the promise and not the the way the
[20:46] winds blew on that day and if we can get
[20:49] ourselves to that place where we can
[20:50] anchor down in the promise tonight then
[20:53] it don't matter how bad tomorrow seems
[20:55] or the next day you're not going to be
[20:57] up and down so much in your your
[20:58] emotions cuz you know God's going to
[21:00] take care of it God's going to see me
[21:02] through this and let ourselves get
[21:04] anchored down into the promise tonight
[21:07] it says he slept no more than six hours
[21:09] a day he arose in time to start
[21:11] preaching at 5: practically every day of
[21:15] his ministry he preached up to four
[21:18] times on a single day so that in a year
[21:21] he would average 800
[21:23] sermons that's a pretty he is an an
[21:26] incredible man and and I feel like yeah
[21:30] it accidentally changed the slides I'm
[21:31] sorry and we spoke last time about this
[21:34] age about the beginning and the ending
[21:37] of Ages and how they don't end abruptly
[21:41] and how they don't start abruptly but
[21:43] there's a blending from one into the
[21:46] next and it's even more so when we get
[21:49] to the sixth and seventh age brother
[21:51] brand says there's an overlapping a
[21:53] melting or Fading Into rather than an
[21:56] Abrupt end and a clearcut start this age
[22:01] particularly flows into the next age and
[22:04] not only does this age overflow into the
[22:06] last age but the last age is in many
[22:08] respects simply a carrying on of the
[22:12] sixth age and the reason we keep
[22:15] focusing on this and making this a point
[22:17] in our teaching it's important because
[22:19] it helps us to recognize that some of
[22:22] what is spoke to the sixth age is
[22:24] actually being spoken to us it is
[22:26] applicable to us and has even being
[22:28] spoke directly to this age and and as we
[22:32] found out that the sixth age was a great
[22:35] age of of missions and and spreading of
[22:38] the word and it was a great age of of
[22:40] revivals and I know y'all have heard the
[22:43] term the Great Awakening this is when
[22:45] this was taking place and and it was a
[22:47] great missionary age it was the greatest
[22:50] spreading of the word that the world had
[22:52] ever seen Luther began to open the door
[22:55] in the previous age but it's in this age
[22:57] that it was busted open and and men with
[22:59] a burden took the word around the world
[23:02] names you've heard like like George
[23:04] Whitefield and and Jonathan Edwards and
[23:06] Charles finny yeah I don't know if they
[23:09] would do it today but when I was in
[23:10] public school I want to say my freshman
[23:13] year we actually read an excerpt uh of
[23:16] Jonathan Edward's sermon in our
[23:18] literature book and I still remember it
[23:20] to this day it was called sinners in the
[23:22] hands of an Angry God and so so we we
[23:25] read sermons because these men were
[23:27] extremely famous because they
[23:28] accomplished so much God was in their
[23:31] Ministry and the Word was preached to
[23:33] the entire world and and it was an
[23:35] incredible time and yet brother brandham
[23:37] teaches us that it was lacking power and
[23:41] we dealt with that Wednesday night
[23:42] talking about the door of of word and
[23:46] power but but they handled the word well
[23:49] and yet the spirit was lacking and I
[23:53] want to say again to to evening like
[23:55] Tabernacle and to the youth because you
[23:57] know you're only the youth for so long
[23:59] you're going to wake up a few more times
[24:01] and you're not going to be the youth
[24:02] anymore you're going to be sitting back
[24:04] there or not showing up to the youth
[24:06] things or however it is that's my point
[24:08] being you're not going to be the youth
[24:11] forever it's going to be very soon
[24:13] you're going to be the pillars you're
[24:14] going to be the deacons you're going to
[24:16] be the the the main singers or the or
[24:19] preachers and everybody
[24:22] went but it happens like this as I was
[24:26] even studying for this I I thought about
[24:28] very specific portions of tonight's
[24:32] material that I remember brother Tim
[24:34] teaching when he did the church age
[24:36] study around the year 99
[24:39] 2000 and it happened like that and you
[24:42] wake up one day and you're
[24:44] 38 or you're 45 and so I want to say no
[24:49] matter how long time terries don't get
[24:51] to the place to where people can look at
[24:53] evening like Tabernacle and say that's a
[24:55] good church that's a good group of
[24:56] people but they're lacking the spirit
[24:59] that that's a that's a nice group of
[25:00] people but they're lacking power we
[25:02] can't ever allow ourselves to get to the
[25:04] place no matter how good the doctrine is
[25:07] no matter how good the sermons are no
[25:08] matter how well you know this and that
[25:10] and can quote it's no good to us without
[25:13] the power it it's no good if it can't
[25:16] keep us and it's no good if it don't
[25:17] bring overcoming power in our lives so
[25:19] let's make sure that that we welcome the
[25:22] moving of the spirit that that we enter
[25:24] into service say God move how you see
[25:26] fit today I'm I'm not worried about how
[25:29] that person worships or that person
[25:30] worships I'm going to give you my
[25:32] everything and let you move in this
[25:34] service today we must have the power of
[25:37] God moving in our
[25:39] midst without the power of God there is
[25:41] no Deliverance without the power of God
[25:44] there there's no miraculous and and
[25:46] without the power of God there can be no
[25:48] body
[25:49] change there there can be no Rapture so
[25:52] so I can't understand when when we begin
[25:54] to pull away from those things saying
[25:56] this isn't the age or this isn't the
[25:58] time this is the specific time that all
[26:01] that was was for the Supernatural is for
[26:04] today the power of God is for today
[26:06] because the most Supernatural event
[26:08] that's ever happened is about to take
[26:10] place and you're not going to walk
[26:12] around here and it's not for today it's
[26:14] not for today it's not for today and
[26:15] then wake up on Rapture morning and have
[26:17] the faith for the greatest Miracle
[26:19] that's ever
[26:20] happened but it's going to build and
[26:23] build and build and build and then
[26:24] culminate in that
[26:27] event this is the age of the
[26:31] supernatural but brother brandham
[26:32] speaking of that day the sixth age he
[26:35] says the power of the spirit was missing
[26:39] in that
[26:40] age he says the word was well preached
[26:44] he never says anything about you know
[26:46] they didn't have their doctrines right
[26:47] and they they mess he says the word was
[26:49] well
[26:51] preached it was well able to make Souls
[26:54] wise under salvation but the power of
[26:57] God that showed forth his mighty works
[27:00] that made bear his arm in behalf of his
[27:03] own was
[27:04] missing except amongst the scattered
[27:07] groups and and when I read this the
[27:09] first time it g it gave me such Joy it
[27:11] says yet praise God it was growing and
[27:15] it had increased over what they had in
[27:19] the
[27:20] Reformation it was growing in other
[27:23] words even though it was lacking the
[27:25] devil had not stopped it listen I don't
[27:28] care how much you go down through the
[27:29] Dark Ages and the bad times and the
[27:31] worst times in Philadelphia and Leota
[27:34] you're going to find times where the
[27:36] devil maybe hits here and Strikes here
[27:38] and it ain't quite living up to what
[27:40] what it should be but he's never been
[27:42] able to stop it and I want you to get
[27:45] that down in your heart today he may hit
[27:46] me and I may be not where I ought to be
[27:49] but he's not going to be able to stop me
[27:51] I'm not going to fall short no matter
[27:53] what I'm still
[27:56] growing that's the key tonight I'm not
[27:59] stagnant don't let the devil beat you up
[28:02] over mistakes and and I'm not quite
[28:04] exactly where I listen if we were all
[28:06] quite exactly where we ought to be we'
[28:08] are
[28:10] raptured but but it's time that when the
[28:12] Devil comes and he begins to point to
[28:13] look at this flaw and look at this we
[28:15] point him back and say you forget what I
[28:18] once was and how far God has brought me
[28:21] and what he's doing in my life maybe I'm
[28:23] not there yet but I'm still
[28:26] growing let him know that you're you're
[28:28] still growing because we will not and
[28:30] cannot be stopped in this day amen the
[28:33] seed was progressing you could see it
[28:37] building towards the restoration of the
[28:39] gifts you could see it building towards
[28:42] the opening of the word it was growing
[28:45] and and there's an open door here in the
[28:48] midst and last time we we dealt with the
[28:51] open door as it as it relates to the
[28:53] missionary field the door was open for
[28:54] the spreading of the word but if you
[28:57] read this beforehand brother brandham
[28:59] goes into a
[29:00] different um he deals with it from a
[29:02] different
[29:03] angle and as we read this section
[29:05] perhaps maybe it was a little
[29:07] confusing what brother Brown was saying
[29:09] about about the blending of the ages and
[29:11] a door being between the
[29:13] ages but what we see is that God placed
[29:16] an open
[29:18] door between the two ages it wasn't just
[29:23] an Open Door in Philadelphia and it was
[29:25] between the two ages right at the end of
[29:27] Philadelphia
[29:29] and right at the beginning between the
[29:30] ages Lea and we're going to move into
[29:33] that right now I have set before thee an
[29:36] open door he says I Know Thy Works
[29:39] behold I've set before thee an open door
[29:42] and I highlighted three parts because
[29:43] that's what we're going to focus on and
[29:45] no man can shut it for thou Hast a
[29:47] little strength and has kept my word and
[29:50] has not denied my name brother Brown
[29:54] says notice how this verse Revelation 38
[29:57] goes Open Door little strength word name
[30:01] that open door has to do with all three
[30:05] now what does the door signify and now I
[30:09] know we dealt with this a good bit
[30:10] Wednesday night we covered a lot of this
[30:12] so hopefully it'll be familiar to you
[30:15] but John 10:7 says then said Jesus unto
[30:18] them again verily verily I say unto you
[30:22] I am the
[30:24] door of the
[30:26] Sheep and brother Brandon when he's
[30:28] teaching on this he says when I was over
[30:30] in the East I saw that at night the
[30:32] shepherd would gather all his sheep
[30:34] together he would put them into the fold
[30:37] then he would count them when he was
[30:40] sure that they were all
[30:42] in when he was sure that they were all
[30:46] in listen I want you to get it down in
[30:48] your heart
[30:50] today he's not going to lose
[30:53] you the devil keeps coming and because
[30:56] of this and because of that and because
[30:57] you're in a slump you're not really
[31:00] his you're not going to make it you're
[31:03] not going to be there and listen we are
[31:05] to take those things and we're to grab
[31:07] them and we're to take those
[31:08] imaginations and cast down anything that
[31:11] exalts itself against the word of God
[31:14] tonight he's telling you are a son of
[31:16] God you are a daughter of God you are
[31:19] going to make it maybe you're going
[31:20] through a tough battle right now maybe
[31:22] you don't feel like a Son of God or a
[31:23] daughter of God tonight but that has
[31:25] nothing to do with the reality of the
[31:27] word word and he's telling you I'm
[31:29] counting everyone I know which ones are
[31:31] mine and I'm not going to lose a one of
[31:34] them I'm not going to lose you tonight
[31:36] well how do I know if you hear that
[31:38] knock on your heart he's not knocking on
[31:40] your heart just to prank you he's
[31:43] knocking on your heart because you
[31:44] belong to him he's knocking on your
[31:46] heart because you're going to make it
[31:47] he's knocking on your heart because you
[31:49] are his child
[31:52] tonight brother Brown says he he he
[31:55] would put them into the fold then he
[31:56] would count them when he was sure that
[31:58] they were all in he would lie down in
[32:01] the open door of the fold and literally
[32:04] become the door of the fold that Thrills
[32:08] my heart once again I know there's
[32:11] wolves out there I know there's demons
[32:13] out there I know there's evil influences
[32:15] out there and I know they're trying to
[32:17] get to our young people I know they're
[32:18] trying to get into our homes I know
[32:20] they're trying to rob you but listen you
[32:22] don't got to be scared tonight because
[32:24] he's laying in the doorway tonight
[32:27] listen there's no peace like you have in
[32:29] Jesus there's no safety like you have in
[32:31] Jesus there's no comfort that you can
[32:33] have in your life like you can have
[32:35] tonight when you're with Jesus Christ
[32:38] amen
[32:39] amen I know that the devil's going about
[32:42] like a roaring line and he's screaming
[32:44] and he's howling but just remember he's
[32:46] on the other side of the door tonight I
[32:49] know he's trying to get you but Jesus
[32:51] has laid down in the doorway Jesus gave
[32:54] his life for you you don't have anything
[32:56] to fear tonight brother brandham says
[32:59] when night time comes I want to be in
[33:02] his fold I want to be in his care listen
[33:07] it's dark Saints it's the darkest of
[33:09] nights but we're in his care tonight if
[33:12] you're not it say it's not too late but
[33:14] this just a Bible study tonight brother
[33:16] and I I know but he'll meet you at a
[33:18] Bible study he'll meet you right here
[33:20] tonight if you just want to Lay Your
[33:21] Heart down say Jesus I want to come into
[33:23] the fold tonight I want that peace that
[33:26] passes all understand I want that
[33:28] Comfort I want to know that I know that
[33:30] I know that I've given Jesus my
[33:34] everything as we move on I want to call
[33:38] our attention back to a thought from
[33:40] earlier in our studies maybe the first
[33:42] or second one we ever had and we talked
[33:45] about the
[33:46] importance of
[33:49] Revelation and if you'll remember in
[33:51] Matthew 16 Jesus comes and he asks Peter
[33:54] and he says who do you say that I
[33:58] am and Peter answers and he says Thou
[34:01] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[34:05] and Jesus responds to to Peter there and
[34:08] he
[34:08] says blessed art thou Simon barjona for
[34:12] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[34:14] unto thee but my Father which is in
[34:18] heaven and I say also unto thee Thou Art
[34:21] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[34:24] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[34:28] Prevail against it now now the Catholics
[34:31] and different ones have taken that and
[34:33] they say okay he said Thou Art Peter and
[34:35] and Peter means little Stone and and so
[34:38] he's the rock that he built the church
[34:40] on so he built the church on a guy who
[34:43] just a few days later is going to deny
[34:45] him who just a few days later is going
[34:47] to curse and say I never knew the man
[34:50] but if you'll back up just a little bit
[34:52] and read it all together he says Flesh
[34:55] and Blood hath not revealed this to you
[34:59] but my Father which is in
[35:01] heaven and then he and he's saying and
[35:04] Upon This Rock The Rock of Revelation
[35:07] not just any Revelation but the rock of
[35:09] the revelation of who Jesus is when you
[35:14] get that Revelation that's what he's
[35:16] building his church on and the Gates of
[35:19] Hell shall not Prevail against it Amen
[35:23] brother BR says it isn't as the
[35:24] Protestants say that the church is built
[35:27] upon
[35:28] Jesus it was the
[35:31] Revelation he says read it the way it is
[35:33] written Flesh and Blood have not
[35:35] revealed it but my father hath revealed
[35:37] it and Upon This Rock Revelation I will
[35:40] build my church the church is built on
[35:45] Revelation the church is built on
[35:48] Revelation so you can never
[35:50] overemphasize how important Revelation
[35:53] is and that's what we mean when we say
[35:56] things like hey we don't want this to be
[35:57] a head kn knowled we don't want this to
[35:59] be something you memorize okay Malachi 4
[36:02] Revelation 10:7 Luke 17:30 okay brother
[36:05] Brandon was born the angel visited him
[36:07] in this
[36:09] year that's all that's all good stuff
[36:11] I'm glad if you know some facts but
[36:13] that's like knowing facts about the
[36:14] Civil War they're just facts they're
[36:18] just historical events but what you want
[36:21] is for the
[36:22] revelation of Jesus Christ the the
[36:25] revelation of the revealed word of the
[36:27] hour the revelation of who Jesus is and
[36:29] the revelation of who you are and that
[36:31] you're his and that when he said that
[36:33] repent be baptized and you shall receive
[36:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[36:38] Revelation that he was speaking to you
[36:40] and the Revelation that the promise is
[36:42] unto you and when that Revelation gets
[36:44] on the inside of you and it's not just a
[36:46] jump or a shout although it'll cause
[36:48] that sometimes but it's an anchor that
[36:50] grabs hold and it grabs hold it may be
[36:53] bumping along the bottom tonight and
[36:54] you're wondering and you're wondering
[36:55] but he's telling you there's a re ation
[36:58] for you tonight that it's for you that
[37:00] you're his and that the Holy Ghost is
[37:03] yours tonight if you can just grab a
[37:05] hold of it let that Revelation sink down
[37:08] that's what it's built upon we've said
[37:11] it before that that you know the one who
[37:13] has an experience is not at the mercy of
[37:16] a man who has an
[37:17] argument once you experiencing people
[37:20] can come and point out all the facts
[37:22] they want it don't matter I was there I
[37:26] experienced it I saw it
[37:29] it you can come with all kind of facts
[37:31] telling me what I did today and you
[37:34] might can line them all up but I was the
[37:36] one there you'll never talk me out of
[37:38] what I did
[37:40] today it's like the little boy eating
[37:42] the
[37:43] apple and he asked the the man who was
[37:46] who was mocking you whether there was a
[37:48] God and and all these things and how he
[37:50] wasn't
[37:51] real and little boy asked him says well
[37:53] let me ask you a
[37:55] question is this apple sweet
[37:58] or is it
[37:59] sour and the man said I don't know I'm
[38:01] not the one eating it and little boy
[38:03] said that's what I
[38:05] thought let them come and tell you this
[38:07] ain't real they're not the one eating
[38:09] from it tonight they're not the one
[38:11] feeding from it tonight they're not the
[38:12] ones experiencing it tonight and once
[38:15] you experience it for yourself and get
[38:17] that Revelation for yourself no devil in
[38:20] hell is going to be able to Prevail
[38:22] against that amen
[38:27] brother brandham says the importance of
[38:29] Revelation by the spirit to a True
[38:32] Believer can never be
[38:34] overemphasized Revelation means more to
[38:37] you than perhaps you realize now I'm not
[38:41] talking about this book of Revelation
[38:43] and you I'm talking about all Revelation
[38:46] it is tremendously important to the
[38:49] church he goes on to say yes Satan hates
[38:52] Revelation but we love it with true
[38:54] Revelation in our lives the Gates of
[38:56] Hell cannot prevail against us but we
[38:58] will prevail over them now I'm still I'm
[39:03] talking about Revelation but I'm dealing
[39:04] with that open door between the ages
[39:06] okay that that's where we're at and what
[39:09] the first early church had was the
[39:12] revelation of the godhead as one God the
[39:16] revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus
[39:21] Christ and that's what we're seeing
[39:24] returned in this Open Door between the
[39:27] two ages what's being opened is once
[39:30] again the revelation of who Jesus is
[39:34] remember down Through the Ages the
[39:36] Catholic church had taken it and they
[39:37] they'd broken him into three and you had
[39:40] three different persons and you had all
[39:42] this different Pagan worship and even
[39:44] people who wanted to do right and people
[39:46] who were doing their best many times
[39:48] were still
[39:50] trinitarians but in this age the truth
[39:53] the door we've already learned what is
[39:55] the door who is the door
[39:57] it's Jesus and he's saying in this age
[40:01] I'm opening a door to you what's it
[40:03] opening I'm revealing myself once again
[40:06] it was in this age that once again the
[40:09] door or revelation of who Jesus is was
[40:12] being open to the Believers once again
[40:16] the the revelation of Jesus Christ was
[40:19] coming he says now then we can see that
[40:22] Jesus is the door he is the door of the
[40:24] sheep and notice that it speaks now that
[40:26] the door door is opening what is that
[40:30] but a revelation of
[40:33] him and that Revelation is opening up to
[40:36] bring us strength to illuminate the word
[40:39] and to glorify his name so what is it
[40:43] here that is set before the church it's
[40:47] the open door of the revelation of Jesus
[40:50] Christ now listen most of you have' been
[40:53] raised in a message church you've heard
[40:54] this your whole life but for thousands
[40:57] of years it had been hidden for thousand
[40:59] of years it had been kept away and Satan
[41:02] had beat the people and beat the people
[41:03] and beat the people with this Trinity
[41:05] Doctrine and it kept them from the open
[41:07] door of power had kept them from the
[41:09] true Open Door had kept them from the
[41:11] way the truth and the life who do we
[41:14] pray to is it the father is it the son
[41:16] how do we get the Holy Ghost but in this
[41:18] age it's opening back up to them once
[41:21] again this isn't a little thing this is
[41:23] a big thing
[41:27] it was in the last two ages that that
[41:29] the truth that had been lost since the
[41:31] first age once again was opening to the
[41:34] church what is that truth brother Aaron
[41:36] that he is God alone that Jesus is the
[41:40] Alpha and Omega he is the father he is
[41:43] the son he is the Holy Ghost all in one
[41:46] person the Lord Jesus
[41:49] Christ brother Brown says but the
[41:51] revelation of godhead is back now the
[41:54] true church can build on that strength
[41:56] again after all this time she finally
[41:59] knows who her Lord is once again we're
[42:02] baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:04] just as they did at
[42:08] Pentecost he says Thou Hast a little
[42:10] strength and has kept my word and is not
[42:13] denied my name what is it strength was
[42:16] returning where was this strength coming
[42:18] from this Revelation that Jesus is Lord
[42:22] Jesus Is God Jesus is everything and
[42:25] they were taking it and build and
[42:27] strength the hold of the hierarchy of
[42:29] Rome was being broken people were
[42:31] demanding freedom of religion and the
[42:33] preaching of the word was never greater
[42:37] brother brownon says never has its
[42:39] preachers and teachers been matched and
[42:41] this statement is mind-blowing and never
[42:44] will they
[42:46] be the Spurgeon Parkers McLarens Edwards
[42:49] bunion muers brainards Barnes Bishops
[42:52] all came from this era they preached
[42:55] taught wrote the word word they
[42:58] glorified his
[43:00] name although we've talked about them
[43:02] lacking
[43:03] power this was an incredible age it was
[43:07] a magnificent age they they they had
[43:10] some wonderful things that they did and
[43:12] as we would say maybe day they had a lot
[43:14] of good things going for
[43:15] them they had strength they they stood
[43:18] for the word and they stood against the
[43:20] hierarchy of the church and and they
[43:22] gave their lives to spread the word and
[43:25] they did not deny his his name notice
[43:28] that that's put in there that has not
[43:30] denied my name in other words this door
[43:33] opened you recognize that is truth you
[43:36] didn't step back and go no no no no no
[43:38] no no no no they didn't deny when this
[43:40] door opened they saw it they said it's
[43:43] Jesus it's Jesus that's where the
[43:45] strength lies that's the Revelation
[43:47] opening up there at the end of that age
[43:50] they have not denied my name the
[43:52] revelation of who Jesus was was back
[43:56] again
[43:58] and I know it's going to be hard for for
[43:59] for for a lot of you who that's all
[44:01] you've ever known or all you've ever
[44:02] been taught but this was huge this was
[44:06] the great hold that the that that one of
[44:08] the greatest claims that the devil had
[44:10] over the church as they were mixed up in
[44:12] false doctrines mixed up in false
[44:15] baptisms people weren't even being
[44:16] baptized right now with this Revelation
[44:18] it's not just oh we know who Jesus is it
[44:21] straightens everything out it fixes
[44:24] baptism it fixes the godhead it it it
[44:26] fix is a hierarchy of who do I pray to
[44:29] you know it's Jesus and Jesus alone it's
[44:32] God Almighty he is the one true Living
[44:36] God the door between the ages was opened
[44:40] baptism in Jesus name returned to the
[44:43] church and they had enough strength to
[44:47] take that strength and to walk through
[44:49] that door they walked through that door
[44:52] and what did it do it led to remember
[44:55] brother said it's growing the that
[44:57] strength they walked through had they
[44:58] refused to go through that door it it
[45:01] would have never progressed to what it
[45:02] did but they had enough strength to go
[45:04] through that door and then what do you
[45:05] find you hit ausa and the restoration of
[45:08] the gifts and now there's more strength
[45:10] and they're able to go further remember
[45:12] these things blend together and now with
[45:13] that strength we push on to the
[45:15] restoration of the word the breaking of
[45:18] the seals we're talking about the true
[45:20] seed here not the church
[45:21] world and now the word is restored and
[45:24] that has given us strength today and now
[45:26] it was a little strength and then it was
[45:28] more strength and now it's greater
[45:29] strength and now it's perfect strength
[45:31] and now with the strength we have once
[45:33] again there's a door to walk through
[45:35] it's the Rapture of the church but
[45:37] without the strength without them
[45:39] growing from stage to stage and coming
[45:41] to this place we would have never had
[45:43] the strength that we have today to take
[45:46] the
[45:48] Rapture amen I'm so thankful that that
[45:51] door is open to us that we're not
[45:52] confused today
[45:58] the next
[46:00] verse deals with the Judgment of the
[46:02] false
[46:04] Jews 3 and N says behold I will make
[46:07] them of the synagogue of Satan which say
[46:08] they are Jews and are not but do lie
[46:11] behold I will make them to come in
[46:13] worship before thy feet and to know that
[46:16] I have loved
[46:19] thee if we think back to the
[46:22] scripture addressed to the second age
[46:25] you're going to find something very very
[46:27] similar to this scripture and I'll go
[46:30] back to it right now we're going back to
[46:31] Revelation 2 and9 so we're speaking to
[46:34] the sixth age here seventh age as well
[46:37] but also we're going to look back to the
[46:39] second age
[46:40] here and look what it says I Know Thy
[46:43] Works in Tribulation and poverty thou
[46:45] are rich and I know the blasphemy of
[46:47] them which say they are Jews and are not
[46:51] but are the synagogue of Satan I'm going
[46:54] to go back where I
[46:55] was I will make them of the synagogue of
[46:58] Satan which say they are Jews and are
[47:00] not but do lie now we see we're seeing a
[47:02] very similar thing we have people
[47:04] claiming to be something and they're not
[47:06] people claiming to be Jews and they're
[47:10] not so so what we see if we go back to
[47:14] this age here this is the second age so
[47:18] one age after the original
[47:20] outpouring one age after the original
[47:23] outpouring at Pentecost you have false
[47:25] Jews now just for our study right here
[47:28] and I may say this again I'm not
[47:29] changing the word but just so you can
[47:31] understand well bringing it down to us
[47:33] we could say false
[47:34] Believers we could say false
[47:38] Christians okay that's that's what we're
[47:40] dealing with here so when you say Jews
[47:41] there say how's this apply to us just
[47:43] say
[47:44] Christian okay so one age after the
[47:47] original outp poring we got false
[47:48] Christians claiming that they're the
[47:50] real thing but they're of the synagogue
[47:53] of Satan now if we come back to this one
[47:56] it's one age after the
[48:00] reformation and you have once again them
[48:02] showing up and saying we're the real
[48:07] Reformation we're the so it's not by
[48:09] accident okay falsely claiming to be
[48:13] true brother brandham says here he says
[48:15] this is hardly an accident indeed it is
[48:18] it is not an accident it's a principle
[48:20] of
[48:21] Satan that principle is to organize and
[48:24] claim originality
[48:27] and therefore be entitled to special
[48:29] rights and privileges what they do is is
[48:32] he gets in the church he organizes the
[48:35] church and because it's been organized
[48:37] now it dies and they leave the original
[48:40] life but they keep the name
[48:43] Christian they're no longer Christians
[48:45] but they're keeping the name
[48:47] Christian all so so Jesus is looking at
[48:50] it saying they're claiming to be Jews
[48:52] they're claiming to be Believers they're
[48:55] claiming to be Christians but they're
[48:58] Liars he's calling it how it is he's not
[49:01] petting things here they keep the name
[49:04] Christian and claim to be the original
[49:06] brother Bram says now of course this
[49:08] synagogue group wouldn't say they're of
[49:11] Satan no sir they say they're of God but
[49:15] they lie for he that is a true
[49:19] Jew Christian what they claim to be is
[49:22] one who is a Jew inwardly in the spirit
[49:27] remember what I say we can't be lacking
[49:28] the spirit
[49:29] here says so then if they are false it
[49:32] means that they are just like Jude 19
[49:35] says having not the spirit children of
[49:38] God are born of the spirit these have
[49:40] not the spirit and therefore they are
[49:42] not children of God no matter how
[49:44] fervently they protest and to what links
[49:47] they go to try to prove that they
[49:50] are if you look at at Romans 2:29 what's
[49:53] it say but he is a Jew let's just keep
[49:56] the ener changing the word for our
[49:57] understanding he is a
[50:00] Christian which is one
[50:02] inwardly and circumcision is that of the
[50:05] heart in the spirit not in the letter
[50:07] whose praise is not of men but of God
[50:11] it's not about their physical birth he's
[50:13] saying it's about their spiritual
[50:16] birth you interchange that there
[50:19] Revelations 3:9 we're going to read that
[50:21] again I'm going to go back and just read
[50:23] it behold I will make them of the
[50:25] synagogue of Satan with say they are
[50:28] Christians and are
[50:31] not but do
[50:33] lie think about it to be born again and
[50:37] filled with his spirit is what makes you
[50:39] a
[50:40] Christian filled with his spirit is what
[50:42] makes you a Christian not coming to
[50:44] church every service although a
[50:45] Christian
[50:47] will not doing the things you're
[50:49] supposed to do although a Christian will
[50:51] not signing your name on a book
[50:53] somewhere that doesn't make you a
[50:55] Christian a Christian is someone who's
[50:57] been born again by the spirit of God
[51:01] Amen somebody who's sold out to
[51:03] themselves but what's happening is the
[51:05] false
[51:06] Vine they get in and they convince
[51:09] millions that they don't have to have
[51:11] that life they can join the church
[51:13] something that's dead and still claim
[51:15] his
[51:16] name they still claim his name even
[51:19] though they don't have his life and
[51:21] that's the tactic of the enemy let
[51:24] people think they're Christians listen
[51:27] if people think they're going to heaven
[51:28] there's no reason to change
[51:31] anything if from the pull pit they're
[51:33] told over and over again just say just
[51:35] you know just make a a decision and
[51:38] you're
[51:40] good then why would they ever change
[51:42] anything and that's the tactic of the
[51:44] devil to actually convince people not to
[51:47] stand up there and go I'm the devil and
[51:49] you're all going to go to hell well that
[51:52] wouldn't
[51:54] work but what's he do he LS them to
[51:56] sleep Jesus is a god of love brother
[51:59] Brown says they turn him into a Doty old
[52:01] Grandpa you know Grandpa don't want to
[52:03] punish the grand babies say turn him
[52:06] into do old grandpa everything's okay
[52:08] everything's good you're going to heaven
[52:10] everything's great everything
[52:12] everything's
[52:14] perfect so what do they do they keep the
[52:17] name and claim originality ask the
[52:19] Catholic Church they'll tell you we're
[52:20] the original we're the first church
[52:24] we're the original Church brother br
[52:26] says but now the cunningness of the
[52:28] Devil Makes the people believe that they
[52:30] are Christian when they are
[52:34] not I want to say it again because I
[52:36] don't I don't ever want you to get to a
[52:37] place that you say you didn't know that
[52:39] you must be born of the spirit of God
[52:43] you must be born again you can't just
[52:45] claim message you can't just claim I
[52:48] come from a good church and I say my
[52:49] prayers and and Mom and Daddy's a
[52:51] Christian you can't just pretend you
[52:53] can't just claim it you must be born
[52:56] again
[52:57] again prophet of God says just watch
[53:00] that spirit that is upon them and don't
[53:02] be
[53:03] fooled so I'm gonna say this to you
[53:05] tonight don't be
[53:06] fooled you say brother Aaron how do I
[53:09] know I want to be right but I don't want
[53:10] to be fooled listen you're not going to
[53:11] be fooled you're not going to be if
[53:13] you're if you're
[53:14] seeking if you're looking those that
[53:17] hunger and thirst for righteousness
[53:18] shall be filled but he tells you how not
[53:20] to be fooled listen don't be fooled
[53:23] Judas went about as one of the 12 and he
[53:25] did miracles
[53:28] but he did not have the spirit of God as
[53:30] his own he did have a Ministry now here
[53:33] we go how do I know how can I tell but
[53:36] he never got to Pentecost because he
[53:38] wasn't true
[53:40] seed if it's in your heart to go to
[53:42] Pentecost and you're searching and
[53:44] you're looking and you're fighting for
[53:45] that new birth that tells you what you
[53:46] need to know Judas didn't even try to go
[53:48] to The Upper
[53:50] Room Judas didn't try to get to the
[53:52] upper
[53:53] room he knew who he was
[53:57] so it's saying don't be fooled it say if
[53:59] you don't have a desire for Pentecost
[54:01] you got to check up
[54:03] somewhere because Judas didn't go to
[54:06] Pentecost that's what separated him he
[54:08] had a Ministry he did Miracles and it's
[54:10] interesting when you read and Jesus says
[54:12] one of you is going to betray me there
[54:14] wasn't a one of them went
[54:19] Judas they question themselves before
[54:23] they question Judas
[54:26] look you know how it is and this isn't
[54:28] to call anybody a Judas because I I I
[54:30] believe in Mercy and Grace and salvation
[54:32] and people coming back but there's been
[54:34] people fall away that you're
[54:38] like I never thought they
[54:42] would they lived the life outwardly to a
[54:47] tea they were at church they worshiped
[54:50] they
[54:52] praise never had never had a clue
[54:56] what happened brother Aaron how how can
[54:58] that be you got to go to
[55:00] Pentecost you got to get the new birth
[55:02] and if you stop short of that I don't
[55:04] care how far you've
[55:06] come I don't care how much good you've
[55:09] done I do care I want you to do good but
[55:11] I'm just talking about for this
[55:13] illustration if you stop
[55:15] one step short of that new
[55:20] birth you can always go back you can
[55:23] always fall away you can always be
[55:26] caught and trapped and fall in sin again
[55:28] matter of fact in this age you
[55:31] will but if you'll take that other
[55:34] step if you'll go to that upper room if
[55:37] you'll go to the place where all of you
[55:40] dies all of
[55:44] you it's finished work you're sealed to
[55:47] the day of your Redemption H how do I
[55:49] know brother Aaron and and I know you
[55:51] can hear a lot of a lot of things and a
[55:53] lot of preaching on on the evidence and
[55:55] this and that let me tell tell you what
[55:56] you'll know because your desires will
[55:58] change and you'll know because when you
[56:01] run up against that thing that you fall
[56:02] to Time After Time After Time and you
[56:05] run up against it you'll overcome it
[56:07] this time and you'll overcome it again
[56:08] and overcome it again and it'll no
[56:10] longer have power over you but you will
[56:13] have power over it and if you didn't
[56:14] have power before but now you have power
[56:17] where did that power come from it's the
[56:19] Holy Ghost living on the inside of you
[56:26] and I'll tell you something else the
[56:27] Holy Ghost will do so to to put you
[56:29] while we're here this just comes to me
[56:32] because I hear young people say well
[56:33] it's okay if I do this this and this the
[56:36] Holy Ghost would never let me go too far
[56:40] the Holy Ghost would never let me fall
[56:41] now listen the Holy Ghost won't let you
[56:43] put yourself in situations that you
[56:45] could ever
[56:47] fall the fact that you're willing to put
[56:50] yourself in that situation and then say
[56:52] but the Holy Ghost will keep me you need
[56:53] to check up cuz the Holy Ghost won't put
[56:56] you in compromising
[57:01] situations it'll make you look at
[57:03] something and go Christian should not
[57:05] knowingly and willingly put themselves
[57:08] in a place to be
[57:10] tempted yes you'll overcome Temptation
[57:13] yes you'll overcome when you find
[57:14] yourself in those situations but if you
[57:17] see those situations and you walk into
[57:19] that situation anyway you're playing
[57:22] with
[57:23] fire and I'm just going to tell you from
[57:25] experience remember I didn't always live
[57:27] this life the way it was meant to be
[57:28] lived you're playing with fire because
[57:30] somewhere deep deep deep deep deep deep
[57:33] deep down you want
[57:38] it once that gets ripped out of there
[57:41] you see those situations and you run
[57:44] from them you get away from them you put
[57:47] yourself the Holy Ghost leads you into
[57:50] positions to
[57:52] overcome like I said that don't mean you
[57:54] ain't going to find yourself in a trap
[57:55] find yourself in a place but you're
[57:57] never going to go there
[57:58] intentionally you're not going to walk
[58:00] into the prison and go the Holy Ghost is
[58:02] going to get me
[58:04] out you let him Lead
[58:07] You amen you got to go to Pentecost the
[58:09] false Vine hates Pentecost the false
[58:12] Vine hates the new birth but the True
[58:14] Vine the True Vine loves the new birth
[58:17] they love it and they seek it and they
[58:19] want it and because we hunger for it and
[58:21] we thirst for it and we won't be
[58:23] satisfied by churchianity and we won't
[58:25] be satis satisfied just by coming to
[58:27] church then because of those things then
[58:29] we're filled with it then we're born
[58:31] again and we're born of the spirit amen
[58:34] and it doesn't matter if others mock it
[58:36] doesn't matter what others say it it
[58:38] doesn't matter if they mock your worship
[58:40] it doesn't matter if they mock your
[58:41] Holiness it doesn't matter how listen if
[58:43] you're set apart it who cares if you
[58:46] know you hear people they may name some
[58:48] movie stars and somebody's like well I
[58:49] don't know who that is oh how do they
[58:51] not know because they're set
[58:53] apart oh you don't know who that is
[58:57] I'm sorry that some people's focus is on
[59:01] Jesus don't be afraid and ashamed of the
[59:04] mocking that goes on don't be worried
[59:06] about what other what other people says
[59:08] he says I will make them come in worship
[59:11] before thy feet and to know that I've
[59:14] Loved thee those that said oh look at
[59:16] the way they're acting look at the way
[59:18] they worship oh she's just a m goody two
[59:20] shoes and she won't participate in this
[59:22] and one day they will bow at your feet
[59:26] and worship you

[59:31] them of the synagogue of Satan which say
[59:33] they are Jews and are not but do lie

[59:42] part that

[59:49] their back on you at the end of the day

[1:00:38] message I don't want to just claim
[1:00:41] Jesus I don't want to be false and claim
[1:00:44] to be a part I want to get it on the
[1:00:46] inside of me I want him to come and take
[1:00:49] over and let the message live out of me
[1:00:52] I don't want to have to tell people
[1:00:54] that's what I believe I want them to be
[1:00:55] able to look and say I know what he
[1:00:57] believes there's one that's been to
[1:01:00] Pentecost I know what he was but I see
[1:01:02] what he
[1:01:04] is maybe flawed maybe struggles but I
[1:01:08] see that something changed a
[1:01:11] life Hallelujah let that be all of our
[1:01:14] testimonies tonight let it come and
[1:01:16] dwell in us and
[1:01:18] rule the
[1:01:19] eulogy and the promise verse 10 because
[1:01:23] thou has kept the word of my patience I
[1:01:26] also will keep thee from the hour of
[1:01:27] Temptation which shall come upon all the
[1:01:29] world to try them that dwell upon the
[1:01:33] Earth
[1:01:36] patience it's tough word right
[1:01:40] there especially in this
[1:01:43] age you know people think they have
[1:01:46] patience until their patience is
[1:01:49] tried what is patience it's the ability
[1:01:51] to accept or tolerate delay
[1:01:56] trouble or suffering without getting
[1:01:59] angry or
[1:02:02] upset to remain calm while
[1:02:07] waiting I'm going go and tell you we
[1:02:09] live in a world without
[1:02:12] patience I feel like if we compare
[1:02:14] ourselves to people in past past ages
[1:02:18] even we lack
[1:02:20] patience think about it five minutes at
[1:02:24] the drive-thru window out of Ru in your
[1:02:26] day I'm in a
[1:02:28] hurry oh yeah five
[1:02:31] minutes slow internate internet
[1:02:34] infuriates
[1:02:36] us listen don't even get me started if
[1:02:40] you didn't have to grow up with
[1:02:42] AOL I don't want to
[1:02:45] [Music]
[1:02:48] hear hey you got a a website to load in
[1:02:51] three four minutes man woo you did
[1:02:54] something took forever ever but today
[1:02:57] I'm guilty what's wrong with the wifi
[1:03:00] ain't that right brother
[1:03:02] Mike I'll text him what's wrong with the
[1:03:05] Wi-Fi something's wrong slow
[1:03:08] internet how about this a person driving
[1:03:11] 55 in a
[1:03:14] 55 forgive them for obeying the law I'm
[1:03:19] sorry it make us mad where's the next
[1:03:22] passing
[1:03:23] zone order from Amazon and it's not next
[1:03:26] day
[1:03:27] delivery what kind of third world
[1:03:29] nonsense is
[1:03:32] this you we laugh because we know it
[1:03:35] hits home we know it's true I'm not
[1:03:38] going back there I had to wait 30
[1:03:39] minutes for my meal 30 minutes I'll
[1:03:42] never go back I didn't even tip that
[1:03:44] poor woman trying to feed her kids
[1:03:46] because I had to wait 30
[1:03:50] minutes and despite the fact that things
[1:03:53] are faster than ever we're harder to
[1:03:54] please than ever when it comes to time
[1:03:57] when it comes to speed we're harder to
[1:04:00] please than ever because we've been
[1:04:01] conditioned to get it right
[1:04:05] now I say all those things to make us be
[1:04:07] cognizant of the fact that that kind of
[1:04:10] works
[1:04:11] counter to our
[1:04:14] faith because that's not how God works
[1:04:17] God don't do it on your time brother
[1:04:19] brand just teaches us and he goes
[1:04:20] through he talks about if God gave you
[1:04:22] everything the instant you asked for it
[1:04:23] you would you would become so impatient
[1:04:25] you I don't remember his exact words but
[1:04:27] you'd struggle with life you wouldn't be
[1:04:30] a good person you'd want everything
[1:04:32] instant satisfaction instant instant
[1:04:34] that's not how God operates let's look
[1:04:36] at Hebrews 613 and
[1:04:38] 15 says for when God made a promise to
[1:04:40] Abraham because he could swear by no
[1:04:42] greater he swear by himself saying
[1:04:44] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[1:04:45] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[1:04:48] after he had patiently endured endured
[1:04:53] right there lets us know that it wasn't
[1:04:54] just like easy it was a trial it was a
[1:04:57] hardship he had to endure something you
[1:04:59] if somebody don't if somebody says hey
[1:05:00] did you have a good time the other night
[1:05:01] you go oh man yeah I endured
[1:05:03] it that's not a positive in other words
[1:05:06] Abraham was going through a hardship and
[1:05:09] yet he was
[1:05:10] patient but because he was patient he
[1:05:13] obtained the promise Abraham had to wait
[1:05:17] for the
[1:05:18] Fulfillment but God gave me a promise
[1:05:21] brother Aaron okay now wait patiently
[1:05:25] for the ful fulfillment of
[1:05:27] it but God said I can now wait patiently
[1:05:30] for the Fulfillment do you believe or do
[1:05:32] you
[1:05:33] don't God gave me a promise why hadn't
[1:05:36] because you're to endure patiently
[1:05:39] brother Brown says God gives us
[1:05:40] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:05:42] he's promised to fulfill them he will I
[1:05:46] just want that to anchor down right now
[1:05:48] he's promised to fulfill them he will
[1:05:51] but brother Aaron he will but I thought
[1:05:53] he was going he will but my family say
[1:05:56] he will but I've been praying for he
[1:05:58] will let that anchor in our hearts
[1:06:00] tonight he will whatever he's promise
[1:06:04] you if you patiently endure and hold on
[1:06:06] to it he will
[1:06:08] tonight amen God said he will then he
[1:06:11] will but he wants us to show some
[1:06:13] patience he wants us to rest in his
[1:06:16] timing and in his
[1:06:18] provision not well that shows that you
[1:06:20] think you know better and you know when
[1:06:22] and you know you're doubting that it's
[1:06:24] going to happen he says I got I own a
[1:06:26] cattle on a thousand Hill my provision
[1:06:28] is perfect my timing is perfect just
[1:06:30] show me that you
[1:06:32] believe just show me that you're willing
[1:06:34] to hold
[1:06:35] fast but he said because you were
[1:06:38] patient and you kept the word I will
[1:06:40] also keep thee in the hour of
[1:06:43] Temptation and what this is is it's
[1:06:46] another case where we see the the word
[1:06:48] being spoken here to the sixth age but
[1:06:51] it's the overlapping because this
[1:06:53] promise to be kept from the hour of
[1:06:55] Temptation is actually a promise to
[1:06:57] Believers at the very end of the ages
[1:07:00] when the tribulation comes in he says
[1:07:04] this temptation is exactly like the
[1:07:06] Temptation in Eden in other words it's
[1:07:07] going to look
[1:07:08] good it's going to look like the better
[1:07:10] way he says it'll be a very inviting
[1:07:13] proposition held up in direct opposition
[1:07:15] to God's commanded
[1:07:18] word and what he deals with here is is
[1:07:22] with the great beast and how the the
[1:07:24] very small Doctrine that we talked about
[1:07:26] back in Ephesus the things that seem so
[1:07:28] simple they started out in the early
[1:07:31] church they wind up as this monster of
[1:07:34] Satan that's deceiving the whole world
[1:07:38] and he talks about how there there's
[1:07:39] going to be opportunity to lay aside
[1:07:41] this word there's going to be
[1:07:43] opportunity to
[1:07:45] compromise that's going to be the
[1:07:46] Temptation is your opportunity to
[1:07:49] compromise your opportunity to give in
[1:07:51] to the pressures to to to lay aside this
[1:07:54] standard to to lay aside this part just
[1:07:57] so the pressure isn't so great just so
[1:08:00] the persecution isn't so great surely
[1:08:02] it's not that big a deal if I give up
[1:08:04] just this little
[1:08:07] part and to turn to the E communal move
[1:08:10] and to worship within that
[1:08:12] system and it's during that time where
[1:08:14] the pressure is going to be
[1:08:16] building and when and when the bride's
[1:08:18] wondering are we going to be able to
[1:08:20] stand or are we going to be able to make
[1:08:22] it and he says don't worry in the hour
[1:08:23] of Temptation
[1:08:25] because you were patient because you
[1:08:27] held on you didn't deny my name and you
[1:08:29] held to the truth I'm going to keep you
[1:08:31] in the hour of Temptation I promise you
[1:08:34] a Rapture and right now at the end when
[1:08:36] the pressure is greatest when the false
[1:08:38] Vine is at its strongest when the Beast
[1:08:40] is coming down and you wonder are they
[1:08:42] going to shut the doors or are they
[1:08:43] going to close us down or are they going
[1:08:45] to hunt us or are they going to
[1:08:46] persecute us brother Bram says she won't
[1:08:48] be shut up she'll be taken up I mean
[1:08:52] right here I'm not preparing for a
[1:08:54] tribulation I'm I'm preparing to avoid
[1:08:56] the tribulation I'm preparing to go in a
[1:08:59] Rapture in this day he said I'll keep
[1:09:01] you from the hour of Temptation yes
[1:09:05] there'll be pressure yes there's going
[1:09:06] to be attacks because of what you
[1:09:08] believe but remember the Rapture comes
[1:09:10] in a time of trouble it comes in the
[1:09:13] midst of the pressure it comes in the
[1:09:14] midst of the attack Psalm
[1:09:17] 275 it's the text that brother Brandon
[1:09:19] would read for the Rapture sermon for in
[1:09:21] the time of trouble he shall hide me in
[1:09:24] his Pavilion in the secret of his
[1:09:26] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:09:28] me upon a rock I say Lord set us there
[1:09:31] tonight Lift us out of this old place
[1:09:33] and take us to that Rock tonight amen
[1:09:36] the hour of Temptation he says this
[1:09:38] verse is not a declaration that the true
[1:09:40] church will go into and through the
[1:09:43] tribulation because notice it says it
[1:09:45] says from the hour not during the hour
[1:09:48] in the hour in other words he Ain saying
[1:09:50] I I I I'll protect you and and keep you
[1:09:53] in the hour or Deering now that would
[1:09:56] imply that we were here and we need but
[1:09:57] he says I'll save you from the hour in
[1:10:00] other words you won't have to go through
[1:10:01] it you're not going to have to see the
[1:10:05] tribulation we already see
[1:10:06] pre-tribulation plagues and we see you
[1:10:08] know influences of it creeping in but
[1:10:10] I'm telling you when when when Satan is
[1:10:12] Unleashed on this Earth we're not going
[1:10:14] to be here I say thank you Jesus I want
[1:10:17] to get in that Sheepfold tonight I want
[1:10:19] to be there tonight He says furthermore
[1:10:21] the elect will not only be kept but as
[1:10:24] this move becomes the image directed to
[1:10:25] the Beast the Saints will be gone in the
[1:10:28] Rapture I say hallelujah tonight I say
[1:10:31] that's worth it all tonight it doesn't
[1:10:33] matter what comes it don't matters what
[1:10:35] torment what ridicule he said he's taken
[1:10:37] me in a Rapture and I believe him Lord I
[1:10:40] thought you he will I thought there was
[1:10:42] going to be a Rapture he will just let
[1:10:45] that anchor he will
[1:10:47] tonight
[1:10:49] amen we have a couple more verses to
[1:10:51] cover the promise to his own he says
[1:10:54] behold I come quickly now remember this
[1:10:58] is for our
[1:11:00] age you don't have forever you don't
[1:11:02] have all day you can't put it off you've
[1:11:05] been saying that for years I'm just
[1:11:07] going to take one of brother Tim's line
[1:11:08] he's come for
[1:11:10] many one day yes he's coming for all but
[1:11:14] you don't know how quickly if you live
[1:11:16] out your three scoring 10 it's going to
[1:11:19] be like
[1:11:20] that don't put it

[1:11:31] temple of my God and he shall not he
[1:11:33] shall go no more out and I will write
[1:11:35] upon him the name of my God and the name
[1:11:36] of the city of my God which is New
[1:11:38] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[1:11:40] Heaven from my God and I will write upon
[1:11:42] him my new name he says here hold fast
[1:11:48] that no man take that Crown thy

[1:12:35] word for us all at this time it's hold
[1:12:38] fast persevere don't give up put on the
[1:12:41] whole armor of God use every weapon he's

[1:13:31] here on Earth pale in
[1:13:33] comparison quit getting sidetracked by
[1:13:35] the drama and sidetracked by this one
[1:13:37] and sidetracked by by this and this and
[1:13:39] what's going on you're going to
[1:13:41] rain you're going to receive a Crown of
[1:13:44] Life quit getting distracted by temporal
[1:13:46] things and allowing them to have eternal
[1:13:49] impacts on your decision
[1:13:51] making to him that overcometh will I
[1:13:55] make a
[1:13:57] pillar who is he that
[1:14:00] overcomes brandom asked this and he
[1:14:02] talks about John saying he says and the
[1:14:04] answer comes right back he that
[1:14:06] believeth that Jesus is the Christ
[1:14:09] remember that door is
[1:14:11] open he who is he is the one who is
[1:14:14] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:17] Christ why does this show that they're
[1:14:20] Overcomers because it shows that they
[1:14:23] have overcome the false thine it shows
[1:14:25] they weren't deceived by false religion
[1:14:27] they have not denied his name and
[1:14:30] because they have not denied his name
[1:14:32] they're the Overcomers the whole world
[1:14:34] today is following a trinitarian
[1:14:35] religion but he says the Overcomers
[1:14:38] won't go for that the Overcomers aren't
[1:14:40] going to fall for that because I've
[1:14:42] opened a door of Revelation that they're
[1:14:44] going through tonight the Overcomers
[1:14:46] have walked through this Open Door what
[1:14:48] is it again brother it's the revelation
[1:14:50] of who he is the revelation of his deity
[1:14:53] the Overcomers have come through that
[1:14:55] door listen young people there's no
[1:14:58] other name by which you can be saved
[1:15:00] there's no other door in which you can
[1:15:01] Rapture there's no other way to be
[1:15:03] baptized and he says that name will be
[1:15:06] written upon the Overcomers that name
[1:15:09] will identify the Overcomers how awesome
[1:15:11] is that to be identified by the name of
[1:15:14] Jesus Christ how are they going to know
[1:15:16] Jesus Christ is All Over You Jesus
[1:15:18] Christ identifies who you are I can tell
[1:15:21] you've been to Pentecost Jesus Christ
[1:15:23] has been written upon you
[1:15:25] Hallelujah and as
[1:15:28] Overcomers he says we are to be made
[1:15:30] pillars in the temple of God
[1:15:34] pillars what does that
[1:15:36] mean a pillar is actually a part this is
[1:15:40] a quote right here from the church age
[1:15:43] of the foundation for it holds up the
[1:15:45] super
[1:15:46] structure and you don't think you're
[1:15:50] important you are a pillar that holds
[1:15:54] all this
[1:15:58] up now when God puts a man in the temple
[1:16:00] as a pillar and makes him a part of the
[1:16:03] foundation group what is he doing he has
[1:16:06] given him the revelation of the word and
[1:16:08] of himself because that is exactly what
[1:16:11] the apostles and the prophets
[1:16:14] had well well brother I thought that
[1:16:17] that that Peter and Paul and John and
[1:16:19] those fellas that they're in the book of
[1:16:20] Acts I thought they were the pillars
[1:16:23] they were
[1:16:25] that's right but now you stand with the
[1:16:28] same
[1:16:29] Revelation that they stood with and
[1:16:33] because you have that same Revelation
[1:16:35] and you believe that same word and
[1:16:36] you've receiv received the New Birth the
[1:16:38] exact same way that they received the
[1:16:39] new birth you are counted as a pillar in
[1:16:42] the temple of God just the same as Paul
[1:16:45] and Peter and John and the rest of them
[1:16:48] you are a pillar you have the same
[1:16:51] Revelation as Paul and you're part of
[1:16:53] the same found
[1:16:55] the Overcomer stands right there with
[1:16:57] Paul and with the apostles you are a
[1:17:00] pillar listen and I'm I'm I'm closing
[1:17:02] here we're at the very end but so many
[1:17:04] times young people deal deal with
[1:17:06] problems with their self-worth and their
[1:17:08] value and and I'm not worth and and I'm
[1:17:10] not this and I'm not that you are a
[1:17:12] pillar in the temple of God my my
[1:17:16] vocabulary won't even let me begin to
[1:17:18] articulate how important you are how
[1:17:22] valuable you are who cares that that you
[1:17:25] don't value up to the standards of the
[1:17:26] world who cares about those things you
[1:17:29] are a pillar in the temple of God you
[1:17:32] are so important you are so valuable
[1:17:35] tonight don't let Satan devalue you
[1:17:39] don't let your imagination and the world
[1:17:41] devalue
[1:17:43] you you are incredibly valuable you are
[1:17:48] incredibly cared for but the world that
[1:17:51] standard for men and women
[1:17:55] they're ungodly standards many times
[1:17:58] they're unattainable standards and a lot
[1:18:00] of the ones that are attainable aren't
[1:18:02] standards you want to meet
[1:18:04] anyway don't value yourself on their
[1:18:07] value
[1:18:08] system and if you do reach their
[1:18:11] standards then you need to check up
[1:18:13] those aren't standards we want to be
[1:18:15] reaching because so quit saying I'm not
[1:18:16] this and I'm not that thank God you're
[1:18:18] not but I can tell you what you are
[1:18:20] you're a pillar in the temple of
[1:18:22] almighty God what a POS position what a
[1:18:25] Covetous place to
[1:18:27] be the final admonition to the age he
[1:18:31] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:18:34] spirit
[1:18:35] saith to the churches brother brandham
[1:18:38] says oh there are so many voices in the
[1:18:41] world so many problems and needs crying
[1:18:44] for
[1:18:45] attention but there will never be a
[1:18:48] voice so important and so worth
[1:18:51] attending as the voice of the spirit
[1:18:55] so he that hath an ear to hear Let Him
[1:18:57] hear what the spirit says unto the
[1:19:01] churches how true a world full of
[1:19:05] voices voices telling you what's okay
[1:19:08] and what's not what's right and what's
[1:19:10] wrong what the standards of Christianity
[1:19:13] are standards of how dating should go
[1:19:17] standards of what's respect and what's
[1:19:19] disrespect listen I want to tell you in
[1:19:21] my lifetime and i i s to say I hadn't
[1:19:23] been around that long but I can't say
[1:19:24] that much
[1:19:26] longer standards have changed so much
[1:19:29] it's
[1:19:31] incredible and so what I want you to
[1:19:33] understand is in your lifetime according
[1:19:36] to society standards are going to change
[1:19:39] drastically so don't come at at people
[1:19:42] of an older generation and be like well
[1:19:44] that doesn't matter anymore because
[1:19:45] that's going to be throwed right back in
[1:19:46] your face by your children one day that
[1:19:48] don't matter anymore and the thing is
[1:19:51] it's always
[1:19:53] mattered because God is
[1:19:55] unchanging if he didn't like it then
[1:19:58] it's still the standard I don't care
[1:20:00] what Society tells you if he liked it he
[1:20:03] likes it if he hated it he hates it if
[1:20:05] it was ungodly it's still ungodly if it
[1:20:08] was the way then it's the way
[1:20:10] now there's so many voices and it's so
[1:20:13] easy to roll along with society and
[1:20:17] since all of society goes with something
[1:20:19] then it seems normal but what I want you
[1:20:22] to remember tonight is the spirit still
[1:20:25] speaks to those who have an ear I'm so
[1:20:29] confused there's there's this and
[1:20:30] there's the spirit speaking you want to
[1:20:32] end your confusion listen to the spirit
[1:20:34] speaking quit getting caught up in well
[1:20:37] this one says they're a Christian and
[1:20:39] they're not and this one this this ain't
[1:20:41] about this one and it ain't about this
[1:20:44] one it's about do you have an ear
[1:20:48] tonight the spirit speaking to you are
[1:20:52] you where you need to be is is your life
[1:20:55] worthy of the Gospel are you inside the
[1:20:58] Sheepfold do you have an ear to receive
[1:21:02] what the spirit is saying tonight will
[1:21:05] you bow your heads together with
[1:21:10] me Spirit still
[1:21:14] speaks get in tune with
[1:21:17] that start living in a spiritual
[1:21:19] atmosphere listen to what the spirit
[1:21:22] says standards are going to change
[1:21:25] they're going to keep changing but the
[1:21:26] word of God is an anchor and I want to
[1:21:29] tell you tonight that the anchor holds
[1:21:31] the anchor is truth and the anchor is
[1:21:33] unchanging it's the only standard
[1:21:36] that'll get you out of here there isn't
[1:21:38] another voice that will bring Salvation
[1:21:40] and
[1:21:41] deliverance there isn't another voice
[1:21:43] that'll take you in a Rapture but that
[1:21:46] voice speaking tonight the
[1:21:48] spirit says do you have an ear do you
[1:21:51] have a heart to receive
[1:21:55] he that hath an ear let him
[1:21:58] hear I pray that each and every one will
[1:22:00] make their decision and go beyond a
[1:22:03] decision but just make it let an anchor
[1:22:05] grab hold tonight I'm not going to stay
[1:22:07] here I'm not going to keep swaying back
[1:22:09] and forth with with the standards that
[1:22:11] change and one day this is okay and the
[1:22:13] next day it's not and today this is
[1:22:15] wrong but tomorrow it's okay because
[1:22:17] Society decided listen I want to tell
