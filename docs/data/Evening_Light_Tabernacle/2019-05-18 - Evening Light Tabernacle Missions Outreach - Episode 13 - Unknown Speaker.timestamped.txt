[0:05] well hello everybody were glad that you
[0:08] joined with us again today we are the
[0:10] ministry team at evening light
[0:12] tabernacle man we would love to hear
[0:15] from you if you have questions for us
[0:17] please contact us by information on the
[0:22] screen and invite your friends to join
[0:26] with us today as we talk about the
[0:28] changing of dispensations between the
[0:33] Jewish dispensation over to the Gentiles
[0:37] and how that we're coming now to the end
[0:40] of a nother dispensation which is a
[0:45] Gentile dispensation this parallels and
[0:48] things are happening very similar to
[0:50] what happened with the Jewish
[0:52] dispensation when they came to the end
[0:55] Timothy was there any warning that was
[1:00] given in the scripture about that what
[1:03] God would do at because of their
[1:07] bringing sacrifices that were blemished
[1:10] and not really putting their heart into
[1:12] worship and the coldness and the
[1:14] lukewarmness yeah it was we've been
[1:17] speaking about a Malachi's very
[1:19] interesting how he lines out how they're
[1:22] they're bringing the lame the sick and
[1:24] he says in verse chapter 1 and verse 8
[1:26] he says you're offering things to me
[1:28] that you wouldn't even take to your
[1:29] governor right yeah you know and you're
[1:32] doing things to me that you wouldn't
[1:33] take to some king or you know here I'm
[1:35] the king of kings and he keeps going on
[1:37] down he says you know would you not come
[1:41] in would you
[1:42] there's a kid that firing up Kindle in
[1:44] my altar for nothing and he he says I'm
[1:47] God I haven't changed and it's what he
[1:49] said my like I'm God and I changed not
[1:51] so it wasn't God that changed it was
[1:53] their attitude to change he brings it
[1:56] all down he says verse 10 says there now
[1:58] I have no pleasure and you say that the
[2:00] Lord of hosts
[2:01] neither would I accept an offering at
[2:03] your hand for from or from the rising of
[2:06] the Sun even to
[2:07] going down the same my name shall be
[2:10] great among the Gentiles so it's showing
[2:14] right there and we saw it there it was
[2:16] when Jesus died that the ripping of the
[2:18] veil in the temple showing that no more
[2:21] is a woolly lamb accepted no no it did
[2:24] no good any more to offer a woolly lamb
[2:25] right but my name is gonna be great
[2:28] among the Gentiles praise the Lord God
[2:31] brought it over to us yeah that that's
[2:33] very awesome you know that's a thing
[2:35] that John came out when he came out of
[2:39] the wilderness and man was preaching and
[2:41] repentance and to prepare the way and
[2:44] and when he would see Jesus he would he
[2:48] would recognize him as the sacrifice
[2:51] saying behold our look yes the Lamb of
[2:54] God now this was totally unexpected in
[2:58] their day because they thought the
[3:01] woolly lamb that they were offering was
[3:03] in an acceptable sacrifice but now they
[3:07] are pointed to look at a new lamb that
[3:11] was come that would fulfill who's all
[3:14] the of what the all the other lambs had
[3:17] done and that his blood would be greater
[3:20] than millions of lambs that could be
[3:23] slain and so it would Institute a whole
[3:27] new sacrifice and a whole new blood that
[3:33] was a greater violence there's a there's
[3:36] another fulfillment which is incredible
[3:39] out of the prophecy of John I believe
[3:43] it's Isaiah 40 where he is speaking and
[3:45] it says that he shall come suddenly to
[3:49] his temple it's right in that prophecy
[3:52] of John and so Israel had much pride the
[3:57] Jews had much pride in their temple but
[4:00] God at the changing of this dispensation
[4:02] was changing temples now because when
[4:05] John baptized him he saw the Spirit of
[4:08] God to send like a devil upon him and it
[4:11] was there where he came suddenly to his
[4:13] temple and said this is my below
[4:15] I wonder whom I'm well pleased wonderful
[4:18] so now we have a new temple and this is
[4:21] now where God has chosen to place his
[4:24] name because this would be the chosen
[4:26] place of worship that's right everything
[4:29] is now moving to the Sun everything this
[4:32] the Sabbath is now going to be fulfilled
[4:35] in Christ when he says come unto me all
[4:38] ye that Labour and are heavy laden and I
[4:41] will give you rest and that will now be
[4:43] fulfilled we will find our rest when
[4:46] we're laboring under sin we'll find our
[4:48] rest in Christ amen we'll find our
[4:50] forgiveness in Christ will find the
[4:53] feast days all in Christ now we're
[4:56] changing dispensation from the part to
[4:59] the whole from the shadow to the
[5:02] fulfillment what a wrist and a piece we
[5:04] have knowing that our debt has been paid
[5:06] praising our sin-debt swype Dwayne that
[5:08] was able to be paid in what way
[5:10] because it was no longer a woolly lamb
[5:12] that just rolled it ahead and covered up
[5:15] but it was a kinsman redeemer that came
[5:17] and I love what you said about the
[5:19] temple and he mentioned earlier about
[5:20] the temple veil being ripped showing
[5:22] that God was no longer in a
[5:24] brick-and-mortar temple yes but now who
[5:27] has come to dwell in these temples you
[5:30] know I just given a testimony in a
[5:35] junction in my time talking about the
[5:37] power of that blood that was shed one
[5:39] lamb many lambs you know but not one
[5:41] lamb when my son Andrew was born you
[5:44] know he went he was born he didn't he
[5:46] didn't have these surfactant as as long
[5:48] as he was gasping for air he was dying
[5:51] turning blue and they end up having to
[5:54] ship him to another hospital and so you
[5:57] know in that time yeah I'm dealing with
[5:59] you know I'm just just coming into the
[6:01] ministry been preaching maybe a couple
[6:03] of years and still really young in the
[6:05] ministry and you know the devil want to
[6:09] sit on my shoulder and accuse me you
[6:11] know what you must have done this you
[6:13] must have done that you must have done
[6:14] all kinds of things and and I was going
[6:17] to
[6:18] one more next morning after they've
[6:20] taken Andrew to the hospital and my wife
[6:22] was in the mendon local hospital and
[6:24] turn on the radio and there was just a
[6:26] preacher reading the scripture and you
[6:29] just said Abraham believes in God they
[6:31] just struck me I'm like yes abraham
[6:33] believed in God and I'm gonna believe in
[6:35] God son of Abraham amen and I got to
[6:38] thinking about Abraham you know under
[6:40] the lamb of the bully lambs in the Old
[6:43] Testament in that old dispensation of
[6:45] the Old Testament you know it lists all
[6:48] of his faults he lied he laughed he went
[6:51] down to Egypt when he was told not to do
[6:53] he made many mistakes but when when it
[6:56] changed and there was a new covenant
[6:58] that was made at the power of this land
[7:01] yeah none of this lamb no in that New
[7:04] Testament Paul Peter
[7:06] none of them mentions not one thought he
[7:08] made matter actus says he staggered not
[7:10] that's right exactly God and it gave me
[7:12] such strength you know during that
[7:15] junction of my life that I realized you
[7:18] know I'm not under the blood of bulls
[7:20] and goats I mean well Jesus and if I did
[7:23] do something wrong I say Lord I'm sorry
[7:25] it's done yes and it's gone and and and
[7:29] God just really gave me a lot of
[7:30] strength than that one realizing you
[7:33] know the power of this blood that we
[7:35] have that's right
[7:35] and so what happened to Andrew and
[7:37] Andrew just I went I went back after the
[7:40] Lord dealt with me in there as I was
[7:42] driving down the road went to my wife
[7:43] said we're not gonna we're gonna go this
[7:45] hospital I don't know what we're gonna
[7:46] face I don't know what difficulties lies
[7:49] ahead but I told her what had happened I
[7:51] said but one thing we're gonna do we're
[7:54] gonna look at a promise yes sir we're
[7:56] not looking at a wire we're not looking
[7:57] at a monitor we're not looking what the
[7:59] doctor says don't you know we're looking
[8:02] at a promise by His stripes that boys
[8:04] evil amen
[8:05] and in God healed as long as he brought
[8:08] him in just a couple of weeks turned it
[8:10] all around and today he's a healthy boy
[8:13] 15 16 years old and loves the Lord and
[8:17] and I make I make a joke he's allowed
[8:20] his kid I got
[8:22] Malone's amen because God provided a
[8:25] like man well you know Jesus would
[8:29] literally fulfill the Passover as he
[8:32] would become the Passover lamb you know
[8:34] he would he would actually observe
[8:37] Passover supper with his disciples and
[8:41] then become that Passover lamb himself
[8:44] during this time of Passover and
[8:47] Passover is the feast of salvation in
[8:50] both Testaments the old and the new the
[8:53] blood of the lamb delivers from slavery
[8:56] mmm
[8:57] the Jews from the slavery of Egypt and
[9:00] the Christian from the slavery of sin
[9:02] yeah so you know when you think about
[9:04] the 10th plague when Israel's are
[9:08] Egypt's firstborn sons died while the
[9:11] Death Angel passed over the Jewish homes
[9:15] with the blood of lamb on their doorpost
[9:17] in the New Testament Jesus is that
[9:20] sacrificial lamb and he was sacrificed
[9:23] on Passover in Egypt the Jews would
[9:27] would mark their house with the blood of
[9:30] the Lamb today the Christian marks his
[9:34] house his body the house of the Spirit
[9:37] with the token the blood of crisis of
[9:40] the past oh yes sir then represents our
[9:43] salvation and so Paul would say it this
[9:46] way in 1st Corinthians 5 and 7 turns out
[9:49] therefore the old leaven that you may be
[9:52] a new lump as you are unleavened
[9:55] for even Christ our Passover is
[9:58] sacrificed for us so he is definitely
[10:02] our Passover so in that way he would
[10:05] actually fulfill the need of the blood
[10:08] of bulls and goats because in him would
[10:11] be as the true Lamb of God that it would
[10:17] be the blood of God that would take away
[10:19] all sins a man and this is a wonderful
[10:21] I've often made reference to this you
[10:27] know I
[10:28] had maybe a little child stand up in the
[10:31] congregation and ask the parents how
[10:34] many goats how many Bulls how many sheep
[10:38] it's worth the life of your child you
[10:41] know would it be 110 maybe 10 goats 20
[10:46] 30 see a hundred sheep a million how
[10:50] many would be all the sheep and goats
[10:52] and cattle and all the world will not
[10:56] equal the life of one but the blood of
[10:59] Jesus at least equals to life or every
[11:03] human being because the blood of God
[11:05] that's right so by one sacrifice he has
[11:08] perfected them forever who is sanctified
[11:11] beautiful amen so there were so many
[11:15] things that Jesus as he would take the
[11:18] government upon his shoulders and he
[11:20] would he himself would take the law and
[11:23] fulfill it as he said he did not come to
[11:25] destroy the law but to fulfill the law
[11:28] so like circumcision in what way was
[11:32] circumcision implemented and why was it
[11:35] and then how did Jesus fulfill it yeah
[11:38] circumcision began with Abraham and
[11:43] Abraham was actually a turning of
[11:47] dispensation in itself because out of
[11:50] Abraham come the twelve tribes of Israel
[11:53] and then would come the promises the
[11:56] entire Bible is actually based upon
[11:58] God's promise to Abraham and so this is
[12:01] where we go back and and find that the
[12:06] nation of Israel was born and God gave
[12:10] him a seal of circumcision which was in
[12:15] type we can talk about in a minute but
[12:19] it was the cutting off of the surplus
[12:21] flesh of the male child and as the law
[12:25] came they did it on the eighth day and
[12:28] Israel was identified by the
[12:31] circumcision and it was representing the
[12:35] coven
[12:35] that God had made to Abraham and so the
[12:39] New Testament speaks of a circumcision
[12:42] of the heart hmm yeah that Paul was
[12:45] speaking of that when Christ came this
[12:47] became a great dispute yeah among the
[12:50] believers because this this is a hard
[12:53] transition right this was a people that
[12:56] had been taught that was was taught on
[12:59] the breasts that God was one that the
[13:03] Jews are God's chosen people that he
[13:06] circumstance you must be circumcised he
[13:08] covered and and God remained one but the
[13:14] temple changed the Passover changed the
[13:18] circumcision changed yeah this was a
[13:21] hard turning of the corner for the Jews
[13:25] everything they ever had was
[13:27] black-and-white and rigid you do this
[13:29] you don't do that this is how God
[13:32] operates this is the law so when you're
[13:35] raised that way for not just one
[13:38] lifetime but generation after generation
[13:39] after generation and suddenly there's a
[13:42] change suddenly it was it's not that way
[13:45] anymore it's this it's very hard as
[13:47] humans to accept it yeah it's very
[13:49] difficult and I think we can all relate
[13:51] to that yes you know so Paul would say
[13:54] in Romans 2:28 for he is not a Jew which
[13:57] is one outwardly neither is that
[14:00] circumcision which is outward in the
[14:02] flesh but he is a Jew which is one
[14:05] inwardly and circumcision is that of the
[14:09] heart in the spirit and not in the
[14:12] letter whose praise is not of men but of
[14:15] God
[14:16] so you know this this would tell us so
[14:19] circumcision today we are we're still we
[14:22] still believe in circumcision rights
[14:23] that's we still believe in a lamb right
[14:25] after in the blood that's correct
[14:27] amen and we also believe in circumcision
[14:29] so what is circumcision today it would
[14:32] be the cutting away of the world cutting
[14:35] away of the nationally desired fleshly
[14:38] desires the sinful desires and a
[14:41] entering into the covenant with God
[14:43] so it would be that would be the seal of
[14:46] the Holy Ghost right that's exactly so
[14:48] the Holy Spirit is our circumcision when
[14:51] you receive the Holy Spirit the life of
[14:54] Jesus Christ into you it cuts off sin
[14:58] cuts off unbeliever the signers of the
[15:01] world and you're circumcised from that
[15:03] and it's a circumcision of the heart
[15:05] right where that were and and it shows
[15:10] by the life that you live not just by
[15:13] the words you speak but also by the life
[15:16] that you live that you now belong to God
[15:19] the heart of his covenant st. man mm-hmm
[15:22] and it's interesting that the Holy
[15:23] Spirit how it circumcised is the heart
[15:26] because God is not working through a law
[15:29] to try to correct behavior reform
[15:34] behavior or change the the actions
[15:37] outwardly by law rather he's the Holy
[15:41] Spirit is circumcising the heart
[15:43] changing the desire for the world well
[15:45] for instance David you know in the in
[15:48] the Bible David was a king and of course
[15:50] the we understand he had five hundred
[15:52] wives so I mean one day he's upon the
[15:56] housetop and he looks across and sees a
[15:59] woman over there bathing while his men
[16:01] are out that babbling and he sees it's
[16:05] messy bah and he's a married woman and
[16:08] he goes and calls for her to come David
[16:11] did not need another wife right then you
[16:15] know and he knew better than to take the
[16:17] wife of another man this was a dull free
[16:20] and and this was better so he well known
[16:25] in the Bible thou shalt not commit
[16:27] adultery thou shalt not covet thy
[16:30] neighbor's wife all of these things were
[16:33] written in the law and the Jews you know
[16:35] they had these things on the fringes of
[16:38] the garments you know frontlets before
[16:40] their eyes and Testaments on the
[16:42] doorpost all of these things to remind
[16:45] them to keep God's Word but all of these
[16:47] reminders was not enough to keep David
[16:51] in his time of lust
[16:54] you see because why hee-hee it was
[16:58] external but when the Holy Spirit comes
[17:01] on the inside it is the internal law
[17:05] it's the law written in the heart and
[17:08] and not something that is in stone but
[17:11] written in the heart and it's the change
[17:14] of nature yes so that when when a man
[17:18] looks upon a woman to lust after in his
[17:20] heart he has committed adultery with her
[17:23] already so there has to be a power yeah
[17:26] of the Holy Ghost yes gives overcoming
[17:29] power through the believer that wins
[17:32] situations like that arises that it
[17:35] gives him the power to turn his head to
[17:37] live right that's the that's our
[17:40] sacrifice you know the blood of bulls
[17:42] and goats that blood can only cover sin
[17:44] yeah if David would come off or lamb
[17:47] he'd come with lust or whatever it was
[17:49] he went out with that yes but that's
[17:51] what Jesus came and gave himself so when
[17:54] he died that because the life of that
[17:56] woolly lamb could not come back on right
[17:58] the worship that's right but the life of
[18:00] this lamb came since then that's the
[18:02] Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit and this is
[18:04] what came on the day of Pentecost when
[18:06] God sent back his Holy Spirit right
[18:08] there's no longer covering that night it
[18:11] does away with it doesn't what you know
[18:12] you said that the Jews were known by
[18:15] that covenant of circumcision and I
[18:17] believe that today that we as Christians
[18:19] should be known there can I the baptism
[18:21] of the very good it should make a
[18:23] difference is you should be able to tell
[18:24] those men are circumcised versus those
[18:27] that are not because it makes a
[18:28] difference those on the day of Pentecost
[18:30] when they came out of the upper room
[18:32] they were different from the ones that
[18:33] hadn't been up there any of those that
[18:35] were not circumcised or Elstad from the
[18:37] nation of Israel and the only ones that
[18:39] will be in the body of Christ are those
[18:41] that are circumcised of the heart you
[18:43] know many of people look at the Old
[18:44] Testament and feel that grace overrides
[18:46] all the law of the Old Testament that
[18:48] ain't true what brother Tim just
[18:51] mentioned that Jesus said that he that
[18:53] you said in your law not to commit
[18:55] adultery but I say if a man look upon a
[18:57] woman and lust he's committed adultery
[18:59] already Jesus expanded the lost man he's
[19:02] magnified the law and all of us are dead
[19:04] by the law
[19:05] but when when we received the life of
[19:08] God changes the desire and now love
[19:11] fulfills what I love those when he
[19:12] expanded it he also provided the power
[19:15] to be able to live it that's exactly
[19:18] right
[19:18] yes yeah that's very good well in our
[19:21] next session we're going to be talking
[19:23] more about this I think this has been
[19:25] very edifying today to be able to talk
[19:27] about the power of the Holy Spirit and
[19:29] the circumcision and how that we are the
[19:32] Temple of the Holy Ghost I'd like to
[19:34] talk about some of that more as we look
[19:36] at Jesus fulfillment of the law and not
[19:41] destroying the law but fulfilling it
[19:43] and in this fulfillment how he is
[19:45] actually enlarged it and really gave you
[19:48] the power to live what you could not
[19:50] live so god bless you today and thank
