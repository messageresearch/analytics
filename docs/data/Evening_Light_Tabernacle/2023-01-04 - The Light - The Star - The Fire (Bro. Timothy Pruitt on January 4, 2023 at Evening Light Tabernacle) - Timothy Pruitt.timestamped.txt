[44:38] are not the least among the princes of
[44:40] Judah for out of thee shall come a
[44:43] governor that shall rule My People
[44:45] Israel and Herod when he had privately
[44:47] called the wise men inquired to them
[44:50] diligently what time the star appeared
[44:52] and he sent them to Bethlehem and said
[44:55] go and search diligently for the young
[44:58] child and when you have found him bring
[45:01] him what bring me word again that I may
[45:03] come and worship him also but when they
[45:05] had heard the king they departed in low
[45:07] the star which they saw in the East went
[45:11] before them until it came and stood over
[45:13] where the young child was and when they
[45:16] saw the star they rejoiced with
[45:19] exceedingly great joy
[45:21] amen we let you be seated
[45:24] amen
[45:27] I want to speak to you tonight on the
[45:29] light
[45:30] the star the fire
[45:34] amen the light the star of the fire a
[45:37] mysterious light has been in every
[45:40] Exodus
[45:42] uh it's been called the pillar of fire
[45:44] it's been called a star but has been has
[45:48] been present every Exodus and it came
[45:50] for a reason it didn't come to just be
[45:53] seen and all and actually not everyone
[45:55] would see it but it came to be present
[45:59] to deliver it came to lead it came to
[46:02] call out it came to heal it came to
[46:06] protect it came to bring God's people to
[46:09] their predetermined place
[46:12] amen and I I believe I'm thankful that
[46:14] we are people that have saw his light
[46:17] amen the fire of God you know brother
[46:20] Brandon I just hit this quote and it
[46:22] kind of uh stirred me to think about
[46:24] this because he said we we see that they
[46:27] were LED talking about the wise men by a
[46:29] mysterious light that they call a star
[46:34] that they call a star as they was led
[46:37] this thought come to me that the
[46:39] children of Israel were also led by a
[46:42] mystery mysterious light in Exodus 13 we
[46:45] read it that that there was a pillar of
[46:48] fire that went before them to lead them
[46:51] to the promise that God had given them
[46:53] amen to more to make sure they made it
[46:56] to their destination amen listen God is
[46:59] not just here to tell us you got to go
[47:01] here but he's here to lead us to the
[47:04] place he has determined for us amen you
[47:07] know we could there was others he said
[47:08] Joseph stood there as he and Mary would
[47:11] make their way to Bethlehem and he would
[47:13] stand there looking down across that
[47:15] Valley as they would make that last Camp
[47:16] before they would go into Bethlehem he
[47:19] saw a strange sight it's unusual right
[47:22] in this it's usually right in the time
[47:24] of trouble when Supernatural things
[47:27] happen I love that amen's right in the
[47:30] time of trouble when Supernatural things
[47:32] happen he looked over and he saw a star
[47:36] he had never remembered ever seeing one
[47:39] so big it looked so low it was hanging
[47:42] right over Bethlehem he looked up and he
[47:45] turned and after he helped Mary up on
[47:47] the Rock the rest a little while and he
[47:49] turned us around to say to her dear did
[47:52] you ever notice and when he turned he
[47:54] seen the reflection of that star and her
[47:57] pretty black eyes as she sat there
[47:59] smiling saying dear isn't that a strange
[48:02] thing she said Joseph honey I've watched
[48:05] that since the sun went down I've been
[48:07] watching that star and I feel really
[48:09] strange tonight that something is about
[48:11] to happen it's usually that way you know
[48:14] when you have that strange feeling she
[48:16] had been watching that star in Joseph
[48:18] and the little mule taking his rest
[48:19] breathing and they watched that star and
[48:22] it had an odd action to it it didn't act
[48:25] like the rest of the Stars it didn't
[48:27] look like the rest of the Stars it
[48:29] seemed to be rest Restless moving around
[48:32] it was waiting for some something
[48:34] watching for something to happen amen
[48:37] the light of God looking over his word
[48:39] to make sure it comes to pass amen and
[48:42] I'm thinking you know not everybody saw
[48:44] that star they meant as as we read the
[48:47] wise men went into Jerusalem and they
[48:49] began to ask where is he the king of the
[48:51] Jews you know uh but they had been
[48:53] watching it for some time and seeing
[48:55] this supernatural phenomena amen but not
[48:58] everyone saw that not even those that
[49:01] were close around not even those all
[49:03] that maybe that were in Bethlehem saw
[49:05] that star or otherwise they would have
[49:07] come and they would have been there but
[49:08] amen it was actually amen the the light
[49:12] of God that was shining out and beaming
[49:15] out and calling Hearts to come worship
[49:17] to call in Hearts to come see amen the
[49:20] manifested word of the hour and that is
[49:23] exactly what has happened in our day the
[49:25] pillar of fire that has come down in
[49:27] this generation it called your heart
[49:29] there was something about it it's moving
[49:31] and it's and the way it acted and the
[49:33] way done amen it got your attention that
[49:36] there's something that was special that
[49:38] was happening amen it was something that
[49:40] was special that was going on brother
[49:42] Brandon would even talk about it the
[49:44] star or the light in our day he said I I
[49:46] looked as he was baptized and he said
[49:48] look coming right out of Heaven out of
[49:50] the place about as big as this platform
[49:52] with the Blue Skies begin to churn like
[49:55] Waters and coming right down came a big
[49:57] thing it looked just like a star
[49:59] whirling around whoa come right down
[50:01] visibly before the eyes move right down
[50:03] like a star at a distance when it got
[50:06] close it looked like a Milling fire of
[50:08] light and I thought my ain't that
[50:10] amazing then he goes on he talks about
[50:12] the light and would come into the
[50:14] bedroom or to the room where he was and
[50:17] and and and and the angel of God would
[50:19] step out of it and he said you know I've
[50:21] often wondered if that wasn't the angel
[50:24] or the light that would trouble The
[50:26] Waters at Bethesda
[50:28] amen I I know a lot of you all has uh
[50:31] got into the Chosen and they they do a
[50:33] lot of good things but one thing that
[50:34] they do not believe that the waters were
[50:36] ever troubled they believe it's a Mystic
[50:38] thing or uh uh just a hoorah or whatever
[50:41] they don't believe it was anything
[50:42] Supernatural but I happen to believe
[50:44] that it was because I know God moves and
[50:48] he moves Waters and he stirs thing amen
[50:50] I just want to ask them how in the world
[50:52] if it wasn't somebody getting healed if
[50:54] it wasn't somebody getting delivered it
[50:56] wasn't Miracles or happened why would a
[50:58] man be lame for 38 years lay there and
[51:01] ask for his chance amen but he had to be
[51:04] seeing something that was going on he
[51:06] had to be seeing somebody get healed
[51:08] somebody get delivered amen somebody get
[51:11] moved Upon A man as they would jump into
[51:13] that place amen but what was it the
[51:15] angel of God would come down and he
[51:17] would begin to move the waters and we
[51:19] know that's exactly what happens in
[51:21] their services amen and that's exactly
[51:23] why we ought to be like those that sat
[51:25] around that pool when we see the water
[51:27] stirred when we see God God began to
[51:29] move when we say Amen you may not see a
[51:31] physical light but you can see the
[51:33] reactions and the things that are taking
[51:35] place amen you can see God coming and
[51:38] moving in his people it's the time to
[51:40] get in it's the time that you move amen
[51:43] it ain't all about God moving you have a
[51:45] time that you move when you see him
[51:48] moving when you see him performing his
[51:49] works when you see him moving on the
[51:52] midst of the waters amen amen you see
[51:54] God moving on the midst of his children
[51:56] it's the time that you move it's the
[51:59] time that you go forward amen amen see
[52:02] you he said see the papers even cared
[52:04] they're talking about the baptism the
[52:06] mysterious uh star appears over Minister
[52:09] while baptism while baptize him and and
[52:12] on down it kept coming he said the night
[52:14] when it's taking place when he called me
[52:16] to the ministry I was sitting in a room
[52:18] bit in prayer my I've been praying all
[52:21] night burden he said I knew something
[52:22] was going on something was happening and
[52:25] I got up and I walked around the room
[52:27] and I prayed again he said I've been a
[52:29] pretty successful Baptist preacher I had
[52:32] audience sometimes thousands I had
[52:34] revivals thousands were saved at a time
[52:36] he said but I was sitting there and all
[52:38] of a sudden I seen a light flicker in
[52:40] the room and it looked to see where I it
[52:42] was at and I thought well here and I was
[52:45] praying and weighing them heels I know
[52:47] that nobody was coming in that car and I
[52:49] thought what is that I looked and he
[52:51] said what was this very same thing that
[52:53] you see in the picture it was spread out
[52:55] on the floor getting larger and larger
[52:58] spreading across and I thought oh God
[53:00] just imagine how you would feel when you
[53:02] saw that he said friends these things
[53:04] are not just something that you can
[53:06] imagine in your mind he said I speak
[53:09] just as direct as he speaks to me just
[53:11] as I'm talking to you now not just
[53:13] imagination I heard something begin to
[53:16] walk I heard something begin to move and
[53:18] I I seen the feet of a man barefooted
[53:21] come walking in through that light
[53:23] coming to my right always coming from my
[53:25] right and he said that's the reason I
[53:27] have the prayer line come that way way
[53:28] it always comes from my right and I
[53:31] looked and I seen his feet and when he
[53:33] got to me he was a tall man he was heavy
[53:35] set weighed about 200 pounds look just
[53:37] as natural as I'm standing here he had
[53:40] his arms folded first time I ever seen
[53:42] him in that form he walked right up to
[53:44] me where I was he had a smooth face dark
[53:46] hair hair down or maybe around his
[53:48] shoulders he didn't have a beard he had
[53:50] smoke a smooth face and he walked up and
[53:52] he looked pathetic to look he was look
[53:54] listen how I described him he said he
[53:56] looked pathetic to look at him he'd look
[53:58] like he was a man if I could just not if
[54:01] I could just picture his characteristics
[54:03] the character of his face he looked like
[54:05] a man that was sympathetic and
[54:08] kind-hearted
[54:10] Hallelujah but yet he looked like a man
[54:13] that if he spoke it would be that way
[54:16] Hallelujah so I looked at him and he
[54:19] looked at me it was I was so scared I
[54:21] was biting my thumbnails until it was
[54:23] almost bleeding and out of his mouth the
[54:25] first words he said was fear not
[54:28] hallelujah amen that's exactly the same
[54:31] words of the Angel amen that led them
[54:34] said fear not amen it was it's the same
[54:37] words that are spoken by the Angels on
[54:39] the heels of the to the Shepherds fear
[54:41] not amen it's the same light it's the
[54:44] same voice it's the same God it's the
[54:47] same miraculous thing that is happening
[54:49] that same one that drawed them out of
[54:51] Egypt amen the same one that drawed the
[54:53] wise men out of out of and brought them
[54:56] to the land of Israel is the same one
[54:58] that is drawing people out of sin and
[55:01] out of denominational system Amen to
[55:04] come to a voice that is sympathetic that
[55:07] cares for you that knows exactly what
[55:10] you're going through and this he has a
[55:12] face and that is kind towards you that
[55:15] is looking at you not with Angry Eyes
[55:17] but with eyes of compassion and when he
[55:20] speaks it's going to be that way
[55:23] Hallelujah he said I knew all along he
[55:27] said I knew at that moment that same
[55:29] voice that was speaking to me was the
[55:32] same one that has spoke to me all along
[55:34] that was the first time I ever seen him
[55:36] like that but I knew that voice he said
[55:39] fear not from sin from the presence of
[55:41] almighty God to tell you that your
[55:44] peculiar birth and peculiar life has
[55:46] always been misunderstood with men your
[55:49] peculiar life and peculiar Birth has
[55:51] been to indicate your take you're to
[55:53] take a gift of Divine Healing to the
[55:55] people of the world I said sir I'm
[55:57] uneducated I could not go he said I'll
[56:00] be with you
[56:03] sounds just like Moses I can't do it I
[56:06] can't talk but I'll be with you I've
[56:09] heard the cries of my people I've heard
[56:11] the amen the taskmaster's whip I've
[56:14] heard all this going on and I am come
[56:16] down to deliver them
[56:18] I want you to understand with the same
[56:21] angel that met Moses in a burning bush
[56:24] is the same angel that met our prophet
[56:27] and so when you look at the results that
[56:30] it happened that day it'll have the same
[56:32] results
[56:37] amen he said the prophet Moses has the
[56:40] prophet Moses was given two signs he
[56:43] said I can't go people won't believe me
[56:45] he said as a prophet Moses was given
[56:46] through signs so will you be given two
[56:49] signs first will be that you'll be able
[56:51] to detect Disease by Your Hand by taking
[56:53] the patient's hand and if you be sincere
[56:56] when you pray get them to believe amen
[56:58] nothing shall stand before your prayer
[57:00] not even cancer he spoke cancer
[57:05] uh did you hear that cancer the angel of
[57:08] God knows about you amen he spoke cancer
[57:12] that's only disease he said and he said
[57:14] then if you'll be sincere with that
[57:16] it'll come to pass that you'll tell them
[57:18] the secrets of their heart there'll be
[57:20] two signs he said but I will be with you
[57:26] oh my
[57:28] God and it's just then that light began
[57:30] to gather up and as it gathered up it
[57:32] gathered up the up to the angel and got
[57:35] into the angel the angel went in that
[57:37] light the pillar of fire that you see
[57:38] tonight it went out of the room I don't
[57:41] know what to do I didn't know what to do
[57:42] the first patient come to me I touched
[57:44] him with a cancer I don't know what was
[57:46] the matter with them I just let myself
[57:48] alone and begin to pray and Away went to
[57:51] cancer and the woman weighed 150 pounds
[57:54] now perfect health one that was 20 years
[57:56] graduate and Earth with cancer just
[57:59] through and through her but God came on
[58:01] the scene he said that's the way it goes
[58:03] he said when I seen the picture amen and
[58:06] he said I knew it was the same thing
[58:08] that I'd seen since I was a child
[58:10] talking about that picture that we now
[58:12] have other Pillar of Fire he said I knew
[58:14] that was the same thing I had seen since
[58:17] I was a child amen listen this message
[58:19] is not the words of a man of a mere man
[58:22] this message is Vindicated by a pillar
[58:24] of Fire
[58:25] amen that's why we should never get our
[58:28] eyes off of that and realize just how
[58:30] Supernatural this message really is
[58:33] it's not a bunch of Creeds and dolphins
[58:36] or some seventh grade education of a
[58:38] Kentuckian preacher no sir he couldn't
[58:40] come up with all that but this message
[58:42] is coming directly out of the pillar of
[58:45] Fire
[58:48] amen
[58:52] and he talks about that he said I I
[58:54] wouldn't take money off of that because
[58:56] it's too sacred he said they may put up
[58:59] a price so all poor people could get it
[59:01] he said if it was mine it would do
[59:04] whatever it costs to print it that's
[59:05] what it would be but it isn't mine it
[59:07] belongs to them but dear friends what I
[59:09] think it is is God it what I think it is
[59:12] is God to the skeptic and unbeliever
[59:15] that wouldn't believe the signs that you
[59:17] believe he has to believe also and God
[59:19] has sent and given us signs to the world
[59:22] today he always sends signs don't you
[59:24] believe that this will be assigned to
[59:26] you you'll find a child wrapped in
[59:28] swollen cloth is that right the white
[59:30] Wise Men followed a star that brought
[59:32] them to him always God gives signs and
[59:35] wonders he's I think it's a sign to let
[59:38] them know that we're in the last day
[59:40] that even the unbeliever is without
[59:42] excuse now
[59:45] amen and when they told me and brought
[59:48] me it was before the picture and so
[59:50] forth said you'll be you'll die like
[59:52] Mortals Reverend Branham but your
[59:54] picture will live as long as there there
[59:57] is a Christian civilization
[59:59] now opponent the picture doesn't look
[1:00:01] like me everybody says that's not you
[1:00:03] well you can imagine that close to you
[1:00:05] it kind of changes your features too
[1:00:09] well amen well if it can get close to
[1:00:11] and change your features what if it gets
[1:00:13] inside of you
[1:00:16] amen it'll change what you look at what
[1:00:19] you look up how you look it'll change
[1:00:21] all about All About You Amen brother I
[1:00:24] mean he said Mr Lacy looked at it and
[1:00:25] said well it's been said by Hypocrites
[1:00:27] that those lights and around Saints and
[1:00:29] the Savior was just artists work he said
[1:00:32] there they were there because it he said
[1:00:34] they they were there because it can't be
[1:00:37] doubted no more he said that is not
[1:00:39] psychology he said that is the uh the
[1:00:42] optical lens of a camera won't take
[1:00:44] psychology amen it is something
[1:00:47] Supernatural striking the lens
[1:00:52] in the back I just hit this on Gordon
[1:00:55] Lindsay's testimony actually in the it
[1:00:57] says the prayer line was forming and one
[1:00:59] of brother branham's meetings
[1:01:02] it was actually at Thy Word in 50.
[1:01:04] Gordon Lindsay gets up and he says while
[1:01:06] the prayer line is forming he said I
[1:01:08] want to show you this picture that we
[1:01:11] happened to get a hold of just now one
[1:01:13] that brother Brandon was talking about
[1:01:15] which shows a supernatural light over
[1:01:18] his head as soon as that picture was
[1:01:20] taken I made arrangements to have the
[1:01:22] negative taken to the examiner of
[1:01:25] question documents Mr George Lacey of
[1:01:27] Houston Texas and I asked him I said you
[1:01:30] have all the means of science at your
[1:01:31] command can you tell me if there's any
[1:01:34] fake about the particular negative can
[1:01:36] you tell if there's a superimposure can
[1:01:39] you tell if there's been a double
[1:01:40] exposure can you tell if the film has
[1:01:43] been doctored with in any way he said
[1:01:46] absolutely I can so he took it this is
[1:01:49] his words he said it cost us a
[1:01:51] considerable Psalm because he was a
[1:01:53] scientist engaged in that work and
[1:01:55] examined it many examined it many hours
[1:01:58] in his laboratory and then with his own
[1:02:00] name unsigned underneath to he declared
[1:02:03] that the negative was absolutely
[1:02:06] absolutely positively genuine
[1:02:11] he said may I just add this word the
[1:02:13] picture was taken by a hostile
[1:02:16] photographer one that had spoken against
[1:02:19] the meeting
[1:02:21] amen and said he says uh uh it goes It
[1:02:26] goes on he said fact he said the
[1:02:27] statement even got in the newspaper and
[1:02:30] he was surprised as anyone they were
[1:02:31] Jews Orthodox Jews and so I regard this
[1:02:34] merely as a varication and Confirmation
[1:02:37] and brother Branham regards it not that
[1:02:40] he's Supernatural in any way but a very
[1:02:42] very verification of his ministry and
[1:02:46] message of bringing Divine Healing to
[1:02:48] the people of the world friends I
[1:02:50] believe the Bible is true and so tonight
[1:02:52] as brother Branham ministers may we all
[1:02:55] be in the spirit of God and realize
[1:02:58] that's a Supernatural is here tonight to
[1:03:01] deliver people and not only heal them
[1:03:03] but to heal their souls and to bring men
[1:03:07] and women to Jesus Christ
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:13] and I want you to understand this Pillar
[1:03:15] of Fire he did not take it from them
[1:03:20] this Pillar of Fire has not been taken
[1:03:23] from you
[1:03:26] it is still in the Church of the Living
[1:03:28] God it is still moving Among Us it's
[1:03:31] it's still Healing The Sick it's still
[1:03:33] beckoning to the Lost
[1:03:37] it's still pulsating now the power of
[1:03:40] almighty God and wise men still will
[1:03:43] come to it
[1:03:46] and wise men still will follow it
[1:03:50] and wise men still would be led by it
[1:03:52] amen it's not just something that's a
[1:03:55] historical fact or a historical picture
[1:03:58] that we can point to 50 years ago that
[1:04:00] light is still here among us even
[1:04:03] tonight
[1:04:05] it's still moving Among Us it's it's
[1:04:08] still touching Hearts it's still
[1:04:10] stirring the waters
[1:04:18] we'll talk about this light for a minute
[1:04:20] and this fire this star
[1:04:23] he said I was sitting in the room I was
[1:04:25] reading my little Scofield bible and I
[1:04:27] heard something
[1:04:28] first I saw a light
[1:04:30] and I thought it was an automobile that
[1:04:32] turned the corner but it turned as it
[1:04:36] turned it got brighter and brighter and
[1:04:38] looked out the door and there was no
[1:04:39] automobile
[1:04:40] and I heard something like this and he
[1:04:42] knocks on the podium four times walking
[1:04:46] and I looked and the light got greater
[1:04:50] and just above me hung a great star
[1:04:54] and the light was kind of more of a
[1:04:57] green between green and yellow shining
[1:04:59] on the floor and come walking through
[1:05:01] this light came a man that looked as I
[1:05:04] said before could have been a man 200
[1:05:06] pounds a huge man he did not have a
[1:05:08] beard on his face like Christ's pitcher
[1:05:10] does who he is I do not know he had hair
[1:05:13] down to his shoulder by shoulder length
[1:05:15] but he was an olive complexion had dark
[1:05:17] eyes and he walked as close to me as the
[1:05:21] microphone is there
[1:05:24] this is what has been associated with
[1:05:26] the message that we have received
[1:05:30] why are you here not because of your own
[1:05:34] ideas and you thought it was a good
[1:05:35] thing to get on a camel and and ride 2
[1:05:38] 000 miles no you're here amen why have
[1:05:41] you left their family why have you left
[1:05:43] for land why have you left the things
[1:05:45] that you have left why are you here
[1:05:46] because of the light
[1:05:50] because of the star that is shining out
[1:05:53] Hey listen there was many other
[1:05:55] observatories out there there was many
[1:05:57] other men that were looking and Counting
[1:05:59] they kept time by the stars but they
[1:06:01] didn't see that right they didn't see
[1:06:03] that star but there was men that had
[1:06:06] been looking and reading and looking and
[1:06:08] reading and God who's rich in Mercy
[1:06:10] allowed their eyes to be open
[1:06:13] to where they could see more than
[1:06:15] Jupiter and Mars and Venus but they
[1:06:18] could see the supernatural that began to
[1:06:20] beckon them and call them to the King of
[1:06:23] Kings
[1:06:24] hallelujah amen I'm so thankful that
[1:06:27] we've been able to see more than just
[1:06:29] William Branham or more just some good
[1:06:31] preacher or more than just some church
[1:06:33] or some idea or some theology but
[1:06:36] there's people their eyes have been open
[1:06:38] and they've been pulled to this place by
[1:06:42] Star by the Morning Star by the fire of
[1:06:45] almighty God
[1:06:51] and I'm not even talking about
[1:06:52] necessarily to this church but to this
[1:06:55] word
[1:07:04] he said I it's coming the meetings many
[1:07:06] times
[1:07:08] like a big world of fire it's been seen
[1:07:10] in our meetings
[1:07:14] here not long ago he said I was baptized
[1:07:16] in several thousand people standing
[1:07:18] watching in the month of August down the
[1:07:20] foot of Spring Street in Jeffersonville
[1:07:22] and here it come out of the Skies
[1:07:24] visible around before around 10 000
[1:07:26] people moved down where I was standing
[1:07:28] The Voice screaming from it hundreds
[1:07:30] fainted on the banks papers carried
[1:07:32] great articles Mystic star appears over
[1:07:35] Minister while baptizing one night while
[1:07:37] speaking in a building I had about 300
[1:07:40] 000 people sitting out like this up to
[1:07:43] 2000 up he said I started to pray for a
[1:07:46] little boy the first one which was a
[1:07:48] crippled case his little feet was drawed
[1:07:51] up with like with polio and I was
[1:07:54] holding a little fell in my arms and was
[1:07:56] praying and while I was praying the
[1:07:58] light got real bright in my face and he
[1:08:00] said I said to myself the custodian must
[1:08:03] have turned the lights on and you know
[1:08:05] they they run the show around the place
[1:08:07] and I thought well that's that's that's
[1:08:09] strange that a man would do that that's
[1:08:11] not even being a gentleman let alone a
[1:08:13] Christian who would turn on a light in
[1:08:15] somebody's face while praying but I just
[1:08:17] kept praying and it got brighter and got
[1:08:19] brighter and everyone very reverent with
[1:08:21] their hands bowed I raised my head and
[1:08:24] when I looked up come floating down
[1:08:25] through the room came the Morning Star
[1:08:28] Hallelujah you come right up to where I
[1:08:30] was at and I was told my little baby it
[1:08:33] was sitting down there to where I was
[1:08:35] and it sent right down to where I was at
[1:08:37] and I don't know whether I dropped it or
[1:08:39] what happened but that baby hit the
[1:08:41] floor and his little feet like that was
[1:08:44] crooked come down straight the mother's
[1:08:46] sitting out front she raised her head up
[1:08:48] and began to scream and painted and fell
[1:08:50] on the floor the little boy started to
[1:08:52] run it off the platform hollering to his
[1:08:54] mother and there was a Nazarene girl
[1:08:56] playing the baby grand piano sitting
[1:08:58] right down Nazarene people are a little
[1:09:00] or a little emotion have little emotion
[1:09:03] he said there's any nice Rings here
[1:09:04] let's see your hands surely there's some
[1:09:06] Nazarene somewhere well they got enough
[1:09:08] religion maybe to shout every once in a
[1:09:09] while you know he said this girl was
[1:09:11] very attractive young blonde-headed girl
[1:09:13] said playing the piano but when she saw
[1:09:15] that she threw her hands up and turned
[1:09:18] real right and began screaming at the
[1:09:20] top of their voice for it for she had
[1:09:23] seen what she had seen and she began to
[1:09:25] run away from the piano that she was
[1:09:27] playing the great physician now I was is
[1:09:28] near he said you heard it and right
[1:09:31] there as soon as she ran away those
[1:09:33] Ivory Keys kept playing a great
[1:09:35] physician now is near the sympathizing
[1:09:38] Jesus he speaks to the drooping Hearts
[1:09:41] to cheer no other name but Jesus play
[1:09:43] not a word or two but played the whole
[1:09:45] thing
[1:09:47] and people heard it and began screaming
[1:09:50] with their handkerchiefs running crying
[1:09:52] God have mercy on me
[1:09:56] what was it the light camevisible
[1:10:01] I believe if there ought to be a people
[1:10:03] on the face of this Earth that ought to
[1:10:05] be expecting to see the pillar of fire
[1:10:07] it ought to be the people of God it
[1:10:10] ought to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:14] Hallelujah every one of you was born in
[1:10:17] a crippled condition every one of you
[1:10:19] was born and shaped in sin and speaking
[1:10:22] lies and shaped an iniquity you come
[1:10:25] into this world like that born all
[1:10:27] crippled up but the Morning Star came
[1:10:29] floating by
[1:10:31] Amen to begin to burn brighter and
[1:10:33] brighter and brighter until things begin
[1:10:36] to come unclogged in your life to where
[1:10:39] you can see I'm not a sinner that's not
[1:10:41] who I am I'm a son or daughter of God
[1:10:45] it's the fire that is visited this
[1:10:47] generation
[1:10:53] you know what happened with them wise
[1:10:54] men when they recognized what that was
[1:10:59] he said the wise men got the best things
[1:11:02] they could get together
[1:11:06] the best gifts they can offer
[1:11:10] he said maybe they cast lots maybe it
[1:11:12] fell on three of those and they load
[1:11:14] camels but they got the best they got
[1:11:15] the gold the myrrh and the frequent
[1:11:17] scents they waited unto the star come
[1:11:22] out at night and they began to move
[1:11:25] Westward up over the mountains
[1:11:28] and he said it wasn't an Easy Pass
[1:11:31] he said it was a rough path
[1:11:34] sometimes he leads through pretty rugged
[1:11:38] terrain
[1:11:40] foreign
[1:11:42] but when you have seen him
[1:11:44] you're going to bring your best
[1:11:51] uh you know they could have loaded it
[1:11:53] with apples they could have load it with
[1:11:54] bananas or raisins they could load it
[1:11:56] with a lot of things
[1:11:57] but they brother Brown said they loaded
[1:11:59] it with the best they had
[1:12:02] because they had witnessed something
[1:12:04] that was Supernatural
[1:12:05] and so therefore they was going to come
[1:12:07] and give him praise with the best they
[1:12:11] had
[1:12:12] they was going to bow down before him
[1:12:14] with the best they had
[1:12:17] amen I I think that ought to be a good
[1:12:19] example for us if we have truly seen the
[1:12:22] supernatural Among Us and the
[1:12:24] supernatural movement and the
[1:12:25] supernatural touching and the
[1:12:27] supernatural saving and healing we ought
[1:12:29] to come and bring our best
[1:12:32] if we're truly going to worship the King
[1:12:34] of Kings and the Lord of lords it ought
[1:12:37] to be our best worship it ought to be
[1:12:39] the best that we can give not our not
[1:12:42] our last bit of efforts and not our last
[1:12:44] bit of this but everything that we have
[1:12:53] it's going to lead through some pretty
[1:12:54] rugged spots
[1:12:59] we've been through some rugged spots
[1:13:01] rough spots hard spots
[1:13:04] every one of us has but it doesn't
[1:13:07] matter which way he leads
[1:13:09] as long as he's leading and we get there
[1:13:14] that's the main thing as the poet
[1:13:16] expressed some through the waters some
[1:13:18] through the floods some through deep
[1:13:20] trials but it's all through the blood
[1:13:22] God leads his children amen it's a light
[1:13:26] that is leading him and only camels they
[1:13:27] climb the mountains rugged and steep
[1:13:29] they went through valleys they went
[1:13:31] through deserts they went through places
[1:13:32] of drying and barrenness they went
[1:13:36] through all kinds of things
[1:13:40] but just keep following the star
[1:13:44] you will arrive if you keep following
[1:13:47] the leading of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:53] the cross of the mountains that must
[1:13:55] come down you know maybe a little
[1:13:57] southern route or something they cross
[1:13:59] through the Tiger's River and got on the
[1:14:01] plains that star never failed them
[1:14:04] that's a beautiful part about the gift
[1:14:06] of God it will not fail because it's God
[1:14:09] that Pillar of Fire never makes a
[1:14:12] mistake
[1:14:14] it doesn't matter what path he choose to
[1:14:16] take you on it's not a mistake
[1:14:19] amen the children of Israel thought he
[1:14:21] made a mistake but no he brought him to
[1:14:22] the Red Sea for not for their demise but
[1:14:25] for their enemies demise amen not for
[1:14:27] their death but for Egypt's destruction
[1:14:29] amen so he led them in such a way that
[1:14:32] where news would get back it had to be
[1:14:34] gone and long enough and move it around
[1:14:35] long enough and people watching and
[1:14:37] saying they're entangled they're lost
[1:14:38] tell Pharaoh let's go get them and bring
[1:14:41] them back amen what was it they could
[1:14:43] that the people that were looking at
[1:14:45] them looking like they're just going
[1:14:46] aimlessly here and aimlessly there what
[1:14:49] they failed to see there was a pillar of
[1:14:50] fire that was leading them
[1:14:53] that's what Babylon failed to see he
[1:14:55] failed to see there was a pillar of fire
[1:14:57] among them
[1:15:04] night after night it led them week after
[1:15:06] week month after month they went through
[1:15:08] valleys they went through planes
[1:15:10] finally it led them up to right up to
[1:15:12] Jerusalem
[1:15:13] the strange thing when it come to
[1:15:15] Jerusalem which was the Hub the capital
[1:15:18] of Jewish religion a star went out
[1:15:26] I mean he's been watching the star and
[1:15:27] see it go out that don't happen don't
[1:15:29] think very often
[1:15:30] Jupiter's still there been there for
[1:15:32] millions of years or however long amen
[1:15:35] but what was it it was a supernatural
[1:15:37] light
[1:15:41] the star went out he said see why he
[1:15:44] said why he said because Jerusalem
[1:15:46] wasn't looking for it
[1:15:49] they wasn't looking for the star so the
[1:15:52] star was not present there
[1:15:55] oh come on we want to be a people that's
[1:15:57] looking for it
[1:15:59] because you have to be looking for it
[1:16:00] for it to be present there amen that God
[1:16:03] would amen you start pulling and asking
[1:16:07] and saying God I need you I'm looking
[1:16:09] for you and God will show himself to you
[1:16:14] when it got Jerusalem it faded right out
[1:16:19] he said that's what's the matter today
[1:16:21] when we come to this social gospel
[1:16:23] teachings and so forth why can't they
[1:16:26] believe in Supernatural signs they're
[1:16:28] not looking for it
[1:16:33] therefore they say days of Miracles are
[1:16:35] past why because they don't believe God
[1:16:37] can still do miracles
[1:16:40] they're not looking for it why why do
[1:16:42] they say that we Mark 16 is not an
[1:16:45] action no more why because they're not
[1:16:47] looking for a God who can fulfill that
[1:16:50] word
[1:16:52] amen they're not looking forward they're
[1:16:54] not looking for Supernatural signs
[1:16:56] they're not looking for it the light's
[1:16:58] going out they just worship God through
[1:17:00] Creeds but God is a spirit said Jesus
[1:17:03] and they that worship Him must worship
[1:17:05] Him in spirit and in truth
[1:17:08] Hallelujah so when he got to Jerusalem
[1:17:11] it faded out did you notice a gift will
[1:17:13] not stay or brighten itself or make
[1:17:16] itself known where it's not wanted
[1:17:20] that's that's the prophet's word he said
[1:17:23] a gift will not stay or brighten or make
[1:17:28] itself known where it's not wanted
[1:17:32] that's why we need to make sure every
[1:17:35] service we welcome his Spirit Among Us
[1:17:39] if we want more healings you better
[1:17:41] welcome him more if you want more
[1:17:43] deliverances and more salvation we need
[1:17:46] to make sure amen that we're expecting
[1:17:49] him to do what he said he would do
[1:17:55] perhaps you know the major I thought was
[1:17:57] surely he'll be here this is where the
[1:17:59] center of the religion is the main
[1:18:01] church was there the body of the main
[1:18:03] Believers was there they thought to be
[1:18:05] the high priest and great men that had
[1:18:07] Scrolls in Great Schools and so forth
[1:18:09] and the King there was a king there but
[1:18:12] the star left them and and they began to
[1:18:14] cry out and begin the Rouse of the city
[1:18:16] and say hey
[1:18:19] where is the king where is he that's
[1:18:21] born King of the Jews
[1:18:24] until all Jerusalem was stirred up about
[1:18:27] it and they begin to wonder what what's
[1:18:29] why are they making all this noise why
[1:18:31] are they acting like this why are they
[1:18:33] doing all this because they had seen his
[1:18:36] star
[1:18:38] they had been already in men and
[1:18:40] communion or or and their thoughts have
[1:18:43] been watching and looking at the
[1:18:45] supernatural
[1:18:47] and so when you get up in a place where
[1:18:50] there is no Supernatural it ought to
[1:18:52] make you ask why
[1:18:54] where is he the King of Kings and the
[1:18:57] Lord of lords why does he not made
[1:18:59] welcome why is he not worshiped
[1:19:03] why is it signs not among us
[1:19:12] could you imagine up and down the
[1:19:14] Broadway through the side of the streets
[1:19:16] they had to take notice
[1:19:18] these were not just any these are rich
[1:19:20] men he said maybe I could call them
[1:19:22] today Christian businessmen they were
[1:19:25] riding on these camels decked in fine
[1:19:27] decorations they knowed there was
[1:19:28] something about the men but one thing
[1:19:30] that alarmed them was this question
[1:19:32] where is he that's born King of the Jews
[1:19:35] for we have seen a star in the east and
[1:19:38] we have come to worship him he said
[1:19:40] that's the Hungry Heart of many a
[1:19:42] millionaire tonight wanting to find the
[1:19:45] real holy spirit that fell on the day of
[1:19:48] Pentecost
[1:19:51] maybe I don't know if there is
[1:19:52] millionaires wanting to find it but
[1:19:54] maybe maybe there's men or women that
[1:19:56] are hungry
[1:19:58] want to find where is this Holy Ghost
[1:20:03] where is the same one that fell on the
[1:20:06] day of Pentecost
[1:20:08] where is the same one that has the same
[1:20:11] actions and the same power and the same
[1:20:14] size
[1:20:18] we where is it
[1:20:20] we have read that he's the same
[1:20:22] yesterday today and forever where is it
[1:20:26] we have read he's a great healer where
[1:20:28] is he
[1:20:30] we have read that the holy spirit is for
[1:20:33] you and your children and for them that
[1:20:35] are far off even as many as the Lord our
[1:20:38] gods are called where is it in our
[1:20:40] churches
[1:20:42] where's the power that sets the Church
[1:20:45] of Fire
[1:20:48] not a bunch of coal Creeds and dogmas
[1:20:50] and you're you sit there and maybe wait
[1:20:53] for something down the road where is the
[1:20:55] fire at today
[1:20:57] where's the same fire that fell then it
[1:21:00] ought to be in the church today
[1:21:06] where is it it'll make them he said
[1:21:09] where is the power that says the Church
[1:21:11] of fire that makes them turn off the
[1:21:12] television on Wednesday night and go to
[1:21:14] church
[1:21:16] where is the power that makes our ladies
[1:21:19] dress like women where's the power that
[1:21:21] sets a soul on fire and he's out on the
[1:21:24] field testifying to the glory of God
[1:21:27] he said even today in Pentecostal Realms
[1:21:30] are becoming ashamed of the testimony of
[1:21:32] the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:21:36] he said in the scripture said in the
[1:21:37] last days they'll be heady high-minded
[1:21:40] love is a pleasure more than lovers of
[1:21:42] God having a form of godliness but not
[1:21:44] in the power thereof the days of
[1:21:46] Miracles has passed they say there's no
[1:21:48] such thing as the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:21:50] today like they had it on the day of
[1:21:52] Pentecost they say
[1:21:56] that's just because they come too late
[1:21:58] to tell me about it
[1:22:00] I've only I've already got it and I know
[1:22:03] it's the truth I
[1:22:04] same Jesus that God raised up from the
[1:22:07] dead he's my savior he lives in my heart
[1:22:10] and in every heart of any believer that
[1:22:12] accepts him he'll change your life and
[1:22:15] give you no soul salvation and a
[1:22:18] testimony of his resurrection
[1:22:22] but Jerusalem didn't have the answer
[1:22:25] they didn't know
[1:22:27] well maybe it's coming maybe it's down
[1:22:30] the road maybe it's a future thing maybe

[1:25:07] finding him up and down the streets
[1:25:09] where is he we see the star they didn't
[1:25:12] have the answer they ain't got it today
[1:25:13] same thing when God sends a sign of the
[1:25:16] church the church failed to see it same
[1:25:18] as they did then so they what they so
[1:25:20] what they made so what to fuss about
[1:25:22] until they had to call out the Sanhedrin
[1:25:24] court and then to look back up and see
[1:25:26] it's in Bethlehem and they still didn't
[1:25:29] believe it
[1:25:36] he said listen brother if your church or
[1:25:39] the church hasn't got the answers to
[1:25:41] these signs of Wonders the word of God's
[1:25:44] got the answer
[1:25:45] if your pastor don't have the answer the
[1:25:48] God's word has the answer if you're
[1:25:50] hungering for it God will show you it in
[1:25:52] the word God always keeps his word
[1:25:58] as soon as they found out where it was
[1:26:00] so supposed to take place they left out
[1:26:03] of there they went
[1:26:04] amen they had to get rid of this they
[1:26:07] couldn't get breezed around amongst
[1:26:08] people they had to they they couldn't be
[1:26:11] stopped they had to break out of the
[1:26:12] traditions and as wise men went out of
[1:26:15] the city Gates and soon as they got out
[1:26:17] of that gloomy place
[1:26:22] out of that gloomy place
[1:26:25] the star appeared again
[1:26:30] I have to say it but if your church is a
[1:26:32] gloomy Place get out of it
[1:26:35] if it's so dark and gloomy and there's
[1:26:38] no power priests and there's no signs
[1:26:40] and wonders performed there's no gospel
[1:26:42] to say the law says heal the sick it's a
[1:26:45] gloomy place
[1:26:48] amen if you leave it the star appear
[1:26:50] back to you
[1:26:54] find out where he's at
[1:26:56] when you come out of the world and this
[1:26:58] Traditions the glory of God will appear
[1:27:00] to you again
[1:27:02] it will lead you when you come out of
[1:27:05] yourself and out of your sins and out of
[1:27:07] your unbelief and out of your hurts and
[1:27:09] leave it all behind and raise your heart
[1:27:11] to God God will appear to you again
[1:27:17] when they seen that star again the Bible
[1:27:19] says they rejoiced with exceedingly
[1:27:23] great joy
[1:27:28] I see what's wrong with some people they
[1:27:30] just ain't seen the star
[1:27:34] I mean think about it we got people
[1:27:37] today we call Stars
[1:27:40] and they exceedingly Rejoice about their
[1:27:43] star when they run a ball down the
[1:27:45] corridor they run a football down this
[1:27:46] and they do this and they do that
[1:27:48] whatever amen they call them Stars
[1:27:50] that's not the star I'm talking about
[1:27:52] I'm talking about the Morning Star
[1:27:55] and people of this world can look at a
[1:27:59] men that will fail and do all kind of
[1:28:01] ungodly things and worship them and how
[1:28:03] to raise and and shout and do all that
[1:28:05] and they can do that and yet when the
[1:28:07] Morning Star appears among us we're
[1:28:09] supposed to sit like a bump on the log
[1:28:11] and and not rejoice exceedingly Rejoice
[1:28:14] with great joy
[1:28:17] now I understand what the problem is
[1:28:19] people have not saw the star
[1:28:23] but when you see him amen he said they
[1:28:26] must have shouted
[1:28:31] exceedingly great joy for they knew they
[1:28:34] were following the sign that was going
[1:28:36] to lead them to the savior
[1:28:41] he said where Jesus is there's Gospel
[1:28:44] Light for he is the light where Jesus is
[1:28:48] there is fire
[1:28:54] hello somebody where Jesus is there's
[1:28:57] fire amen let's just think about the
[1:28:59] emotional Realms about things I don't
[1:29:01] know about you but I ain't really ever
[1:29:03] found any Darkness to make me want to
[1:29:05] shout
[1:29:07] I have not found a dark place that I see
[1:29:10] and I start entering into it I'm like
[1:29:12] whoa I get to go into this dark place no
[1:29:14] no that's exactly the opposite but I
[1:29:17] have had a time in my life that light
[1:29:19] made me Shout
[1:29:21] because I was in a dark place but all of
[1:29:23] a sudden I saw a light maybe it was just
[1:29:25] a light on a house somewhere and I was
[1:29:27] out in the woods and I had been kind of
[1:29:29] turned around but all of a sudden I saw
[1:29:31] something out there that I could follow
[1:29:33] and go to and know I could find help in
[1:29:36] my time of need
[1:29:38] Hallelujah I understand if you've got a
[1:29:40] lot of Darkness around you they had a
[1:29:42] lot to be happy about they had a lot to
[1:29:44] shout about they ain't a lot to dance
[1:29:46] about but if you have a light of God
[1:29:48] move it in your midst and change your
[1:29:51] lives and Healing The Sick and saving
[1:29:53] the laws
[1:29:55] there's something to have exceedingly
[1:29:57] Joy Great Joy about
[1:29:59] [Applause]
[1:30:10] he says fire
[1:30:14] he where Jesus is there is fire
[1:30:18] and that's another thing fire will do
[1:30:20] it will bring emotion out of you
[1:30:25] how many of your sisters ever burnt your
[1:30:27] hand on a stove or a hot plate or
[1:30:29] brothers on a barbecue whatever
[1:30:31] it brought some emotion out of you some
[1:30:34] maybe just a little ow that hurt some
[1:30:36] people got more fire oh they're more hey
[1:30:40] what do you call that I'm looking for
[1:30:41] the word
[1:30:43] they're they're able to take pain
[1:30:44] tolerance fire tolerance
[1:30:50] some people Fireproof
[1:30:54] the fire god can move through and it
[1:30:55] don't do nothing to them
[1:30:59] amen but those that are looking for it
[1:31:02] and all of a sudden they see it moving
[1:31:04] they see things happening and signs and
[1:31:06] wonders follow and move and it does
[1:31:08] something to them
[1:31:11] amen
[1:31:13] he said night after night we see him
[1:31:14] coming on the scene saving the first
[1:31:16] Souls saving the first saving first the
[1:31:19] last the lost souls giving them the Holy
[1:31:21] Spirit that's seeking after it come and
[1:31:22] call him back to backsliders that's the
[1:31:25] signs to follow and then we see him also
[1:31:27] raise up sick and The Afflicted making
[1:31:29] them well he's doing that along now for
[1:31:32] some time but then at the end time he's
[1:31:34] promised there would be light there
[1:31:36] would be the fullness of the power would
[1:31:38] be coming the prophet said there will be
[1:31:41] a day which will be neither light or day
[1:31:43] but in the evening time it shall be
[1:31:46] light
[1:31:47] so I said I would say that we are in the
[1:31:50] end time so in the end time there is the
[1:31:52] fullness
[1:31:54] it's not a partial lie it's the full
[1:31:57] light therefore it exposes all sin
[1:32:00] exposes all sickness it pushes back all
[1:32:03] Darkness
[1:32:10] evening lights are shining the power of
[1:32:12] God of the resurrected Christ is Fallen
[1:32:15] Among Us
[1:32:17] the messiah messiah sign has appeared
[1:32:20] that he is with us in us and Will
[1:32:22] Comfort us will help us will bless us
[1:32:24] will lead us to the one who has scarred
[1:32:28] and scars in his hand piercing his side
[1:32:30] he said I believe that same Holy Spirit
[1:32:32] that's here now will take us up someday
[1:32:35] to the right hand of God where we'll see
[1:32:37] him setting there we will live with him
[1:32:39] forever and be his children and he will
[1:32:41] be our God that's my heart's desire is
[1:32:44] to be with him
[1:32:50] he said the scripture promises Jesus
[1:32:52] himself and said
[1:32:54] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:32:56] these things was to appear in the
[1:32:59] Gentile church
[1:33:01] one word against it
[1:33:03] will never be forgiven
[1:33:09] wow
[1:33:11] but it would be a sign
[1:33:14] as it was back there the same Sun the
[1:33:18] same light is here now
[1:33:24] the star went before the wise men nobody
[1:33:27] saw it but the wise men oh there's some
[1:33:30] wise men here tonight
[1:33:32] amen they went over every Observatory
[1:33:35] they they kept time but no one saw it
[1:33:37] but the wise men it was the same Pillar
[1:33:40] of Fire that was sent to Moses and Moses
[1:33:43] was sent to the children of Israel all
[1:33:45] Egypt did not see it
[1:33:52] but it was sent to bring signs to bring
[1:33:55] miracles to bring wonders to lead them
[1:33:59] to guide them amen to be to bring them
[1:34:02] out but the first thing you know
[1:34:05] is they got in trouble

[1:34:25] he loves to put trouble down to see what
[1:34:28] you're going to do about it
[1:34:31] so he just stopped up the Red Sea and
[1:34:34] the first thing you know
[1:34:36] he marched them right on through that
[1:34:37] place see how God likes to do it he
[1:34:39] loves to display his power and love he's
[1:34:41] God he just loves to show you who he is
[1:34:43] he said the trouble of this day people
[1:34:45] say oh them days are past no how can God
[1:34:48] display himself when you're taught such
[1:34:51] stuff as that but God loves to manifest
[1:34:54] himself
[1:34:56] that's why he brings trouble
[1:34:59] that's why he allows it matter of fact
[1:35:01] he puts bits in his mouth and he brings
[1:35:04] it to a certain place and he brings you
[1:35:06] to a certain place so he can manifest
[1:35:08] himself to you
[1:35:11] here come the children of Israel walking
[1:35:13] in the light Moses going on before them

[1:42:08] he talks about that turtle
[1:42:10] remember that Turtle he found that had
[1:42:12] his head all sucked in he's trying to
[1:42:14] make it go down the road and he tried to
[1:42:17] put a switch on it he said I'm gonna
[1:42:19] make him move
[1:42:20] and he said I I got me a stick tried to
[1:42:24] beat him
[1:42:28] try to beat him real good to make him go
[1:42:29] they can go down the road
[1:42:32] and uh he said he just just sit there
[1:42:35] and look at him he said I I got him it's
[1:42:38] almost fixed him he said I got me some
[1:42:39] water and I dunked him in that water a
[1:42:42] few bubbles come up but he stayed the
[1:42:43] same way he said you can sprinkle them
[1:42:46] pour them backwards forwards anything he
[1:42:47] wants to do they'll go down dry and come
[1:42:49] up wet still a sinner
[1:42:51] he said you know how I made him move
[1:42:54] I went and got me a handful of sticks
[1:42:56] built a little fire and set that old boy
[1:42:59] on it
[1:43:00] he moved in brother
[1:43:03] so if your church ain't moving
[1:43:07] hey you can beat them all you want to
[1:43:10] beat them you can baptize them all you
[1:43:12] want to baptize but what you need to do
[1:43:14] is get you a few promises and stack them
[1:43:17] together
[1:43:18] it's laying one on top of the other and
[1:43:21] let the Holy Ghost the same fire that
[1:43:23] Lit the altar Elijah's day he'll come
[1:43:26] and write that promise again
[1:43:29] Hallelujah and an explosion to take
[1:43:32] place and fire began to go out listen
[1:43:35] we're not here to be spiritual fire
[1:43:37] extinguisher I say we ought to build the
[1:43:39] fire as high as we can build it let the
[1:43:42] whole world know he's the same yesterday
[1:43:45] today and forever
[1:43:48] let the whole world know he heals cancer
[1:43:50] let the whole world know he's still the
[1:43:53] savior of any Lost Sinner
[1:43:57] let them know
[1:43:59] build a fire higher
[1:44:01] let's don't put it out let's Build It Up
[1:44:10] for the Holy Ghost Fire unto her brother
[1:44:13] that's what the church needs today is an
[1:44:15] old time Holy Ghost Fire Kendall under
[1:44:18] glory to God that's what we do five will
[1:44:21] move the church
[1:44:23] nothing else will
[1:44:28] Hallelujah amen your psychology is not
[1:44:31] going to move her
[1:44:33] it's not going to happen
[1:44:34] amen your intellectual speeches is not
[1:44:36] going to move her but what will move
[1:44:38] this Church of the Living God is fire
[1:44:41] the same one that moved him out of Egypt
[1:44:48] same one that moved the wise men
[1:44:51] the same one that moves you today
[1:44:54] when this church was inaugurated it was
[1:44:57] inaugurated by fire
[1:45:01] so why should we have anything different
[1:45:04] why should we try to try to build up
[1:45:07] amen the power of God by our theologies
[1:45:10] and our psychologies and our thinking
[1:45:12] and our wants and our desire Let the
[1:45:15] Fire Fall
[1:45:20] it was inaugurated that way
[1:45:23] he said it was inaugurated when Russian
[1:45:25] Mighty Wind came in Heaven from heaven
[1:45:27] filled all the house fire fell on each
[1:45:30] and every one of them brother the
[1:45:31] building wasn't big enough to hold them
[1:45:35] why can't we have services like that
[1:45:38] amen out of the streets they went
[1:45:40] singing jumping dancing wait a minute
[1:45:42] sister wait a minute what about the
[1:45:44] Virgin Mary she was there too
[1:45:47] oh yes she was acting like she was a
[1:45:49] drunk woman could you imagine the Virgin
[1:45:51] Mary could you imagine saying that in
[1:45:52] the Catholic Church Methodist Baptist
[1:45:54] Presbyterian or somewhere else the
[1:45:56] Virgin Mary was under the influence of
[1:45:57] the Holy Ghost staggering like somebody
[1:45:59] drunk and if God made the mother of
[1:46:01] Jesus go up there to receive the baptism
[1:46:03] of the Holy Ghost and Fire for she could
[1:46:05] go to heaven you'll never get there
[1:46:07] anything shorter than that
[1:46:09] might as well get the starch out of your
[1:46:11] collars and come on
[1:46:14] that's right and then when he was
[1:46:16] baptized amen when he's baptized and he
[1:46:18] talks about it at the River Jordan John
[1:46:21] saw the fire coming down
[1:46:25] saw the star the light
[1:46:28] Saul who became Paul what did he see
[1:46:32] what caused him to go from trying to
[1:46:34] kill people and put them in jail to be
[1:46:36] in one of them
[1:46:41] that'll cause a lot of pastors to keep
[1:46:43] trying to kill people and put them in
[1:46:44] jail
[1:46:46] get the fire
[1:46:48] amen it'll cause them to walk different
[1:46:51] it'll cause them to talk different he
[1:46:53] says the light
[1:46:55] is coming again in the evening time
[1:46:57] God's only chosen place of worship once
[1:47:00] his message come to what's he going to
[1:47:02] do in this day it shall be light at the
[1:47:05] evening time to welcome his children
[1:47:07] back home to the true Promised Land by
[1:47:11] the same sign of the pillar of fire that
[1:47:14] led the children of Israel through the
[1:47:15] Wilderness that's God's chosen place of
[1:47:18] worship Jesus Christ
[1:47:24] Moses
[1:47:25] one day he saw something that was on
[1:47:28] fire and it attracted his attention and
[1:47:32] he said that's what is needed today is a
[1:47:34] church on fire
[1:47:37] to attract some of these Moses around
[1:47:39] here to attract some of these Sinners it
[1:47:42] takes fire to make an attraction
[1:47:47] oh you let a scream go up the street of
[1:47:50] fire everybody'd jump in the car and try
[1:47:52] to follow it there's something
[1:47:54] attractive about a fire what we need
[1:47:56] tonight is the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:47:59] that will attract the believer that sees
[1:48:03] it
[1:48:05] Hallelujah
[1:48:08] one last couple years we musicians can
[1:48:11] come
[1:48:17] he said have you noticed how it is today
[1:48:19] we got enough God about us to come at
[1:48:21] the platform say well maybe I better
[1:48:23] come up
[1:48:24] so this is experience worldwide
[1:48:27] yeah I better go up and stand well I
[1:48:30] don't know here I am see home home
[1:48:34] there's no enthusiasm
[1:48:38] there's not a go into it
[1:48:42] or I get into it
[1:48:45] and he said as an evangelist it just
[1:48:48] kills me to see God's people in that
[1:48:52] shape
[1:48:53] we're supposed to be on fire
[1:49:01] what's exactly what he said he says in
[1:49:04] Revelation 3 you're lukewarm because
[1:49:05] you're lukewarm I'm going to spew you
[1:49:07] out of my mouth that's what he said and
[1:49:09] if he said that that's what he's going
[1:49:11] to do so let's not be that crowd
[1:49:17] you're here needy let's get it or die
[1:49:20] right here let's get it or die

[1:49:29] comes into the into a Son of God it
[1:49:32] quickens them the spirit of Life enters
[1:49:34] into him what then what does it do it

[1:49:54] part of it if you're part of the Bride
[1:49:56] the bride is part of the groom you know
[1:49:58] so we'll find out that the same thing
[1:50:01] that she'll do exactly what's predicted
[1:50:04] for her to do in this day

[1:50:14] not by no means a lukewar but she will
