name of Jesus that we come we're asking for your Grace today Grace that is always just so amazing the favor of God on our lives Lord how we are so thankful for it and Lord It's for that favor we ask and raise our hand to you because you said if we ask anything in your name you would do it so we know then that if we ask for Grace if we ask for favor you're so willing to give it I pray that your blessings would be upon your people today that you would anoint the hearts and the lives of your children and speak to hearts Lord whatever the need is Supply it father you know the need they reached out to you today I'm just human I'm just a man there's not much I could do that could help anybody but Lord Your Grace Lord can reach down further than what we can even look up and you can extend a hand of Mercy to everyone in need I pray Lord you'll just Minister personally to each one today and Lord as we open up the Bible and look into the word of God I pray that you would bless the word to our hearts those prayer requests that we have prayed over and mentioned before the throne of grace some of them are very very serious Lord or they wouldn't even been asked we're not coming with frivolous things but truly we need a God we need a God that cares and understands human suffering therefore we know that's why you came all the way from glory and took upon the veil of a human flesh that you might suffer and know exactly what we go through I pray Lord that as you feel those infirmities today that you would reach out in Mercy and touch touch our brother Gary's back our brother Glenn tamlings and with the with the tumor and the cancer be merciful Lord to the needs of your children Lord we don't ask these things in vain we have seen you come on the scene we've seen you take men that were there that the doctors had given up on and raise them up and heal them make them live give many more years we have seen you Lord move upon those with cancer that would have terminated their life but Lord you moved it oh God doctors were astonished oh God because they knew their medicine could not do that and did not do it so Lord we know the power of our Christ that's why we can ask and ask abundantly that our Joys might be full heal your children today lift up our spirits and encourage Us in the faith in jesus' name amen amen God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord today amen just turn to your neighbor and say I'm glad to be in the house of God Amen welcome them to the house of the Lord we hope that you feel welcome today amen and are in the presence of the Lord and of course you know this is our Sunday we um some time ago did this we took our two services and put together in one so we sing a little longer and preach a little longer and and we don't come back in the evening but we we do uh Worship the Lord together and so let's give him our all this morning amen God bless you thank you for the music today and the worship to the Lord and we so appreciate our musicians and their dedication to the Lord none of them are paid they just do it as a service to God and we're so thankful and and so appreciate them amen if you're turn with me to John chapter 5 I'm going to read from verse 32 and we'll go down through um the 39th verse and then we'll let you be seated there is another that beareth witness of me and I know that witness which he Witnesses of me is true you sent unto John and he bear witness unto the truth but I receive not testimony from man but these things I say that you might be saved he was a burning and Shining Light and you were willing for season to rejoice in his light but I have a greater witness than that of John for The Works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father has sent me and the father himself which has sent me has borne witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he has sent him you believe not search the scripture for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me God bless you can be seated and if you will be turning to the Book of Judges we're going to read a second reading from there Judges chapter 13 verse1 and looking into the word of God as the Bible said Jesus saying search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life they are they that testify of me so we're going to look into the scripture to see it bear witness of Christ and his manifestation of himself in our day so if you'll look with me to Judges chapter 13 and and we'll read from verse one and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them to the hand of the Philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of Zora of the family of the danites whose name was manoah and his wife was Baron and bar not and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren and beest not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink nor eat any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines and then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of God came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an Angel very terrible but I asked him not whence he was neither told me his name but he said unto me behold Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink nor eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death amen my I tell you I just love to read the word of God and I'd like to read in the Bible about angels appearing to men and women as he has down through time the Supernatural is always something that is of so vital importance that we experience in our Christian walk and and of course um it's not just an Old Testament occurrence for angels to appear but Angels appeared in the New Testament they appeared into Zachariah to Mary to Jesus to um Mary Magdalene and those at the Tomb of Jesus they appeared unto Peter when he was in prison and set him free they they appeared unto Cornelius at his house there and and told him to send after one Simon called Peter and he would tell him the way of life he appeared unto Phillip and uh instructed him in his Evangelistic work appeared to Paul when he was out on the sea and about to be destroyed and the angel of the Lord came and stood by him and told him that he would not perish and of course he appeared to John the angels of the Lord appeared to John the Revelator it's happened many times down to the ages and of certainty in our day it was a frequent occurrence to brother brandham and the appearing of angels should be happening today and and of course Even in our personal life that we should have Angelic visitations um and of course you say well the Holy Spirit has come and and yeah he had already came and and he appeared to Paul and he also appeared to Peter and to Phillip and all of that so there even though the holy spirit is here and is our guide and our leader we also can receive uh instructions and direction from from Angelic spirits of God now Samson was chosen to be a deliverer he was a gift of strength that was given to him ministered by an Angel and I'm going to speak about him today as I look at Samson as a a type of of Christ he's a type of the believer as well the beli in church and um Samson's mother of course might have told him when he was but a little bitty boy he said right now you may just seem to be an ordinary boy but you were born to be a Nazarite to the lord and there are just things that you cannot do if you want to keep your strength right for the Lord before the foundation of the world has ordained you for this ministry and so God identified himself with this boy that was chosen to be a Nazarite now you know again he would he would show this even in the Book of Revelation as he holds seven stars in his hands and these Seven Stars are seven Messengers that with seven um men that are sent out by God for down to the ages that God would use them to bring the church back to the truth and so he he again is identifying himself with man as he as as he's depicted in Revelation 1 walking among the seven golden candlesticks and these are God's Messengers and they may be repudiated they may be questioned but and and maybe in human Minds it may not seem to qualify and maybe that's even what the world would think about you or me this morning but nevertheless they were God's men and God's stars to the age and so God would use in in his time and Abraham and he lied and he used to Moses and he rebelled and he used to Jonah and he disobeyed and a Samson and he sinned and a David and he murdered and he used Joshua and and a Joseph and and even though that many of these we would we would pick out some very severe blemishes you know um and and and maybe these with blemishes in the Bible that are spoke of men with blemishes out outnumber those whose whose lives seem to be perfect but all were his none can deny that he used them and by his holy spirit that he put put within them to to defeat the Devil in their age and to to their own messenger they stood or they fell or to their own master I meant they either stood or fell and in them was accomplished The Sovereign will of God and so when we look at a man like Samson we know his story we know where where he he faltered and he failed but yet at the same time he was a man used of God in his time and in his place because he was a man called for a purpose and you two are called for a purpose you see everything is going to work for your good you that that to see that you will achieve God's purpose your job is to defeat Philistines Philistines of unbelief and sin and doubt and to deliver God's people from bondage you have been called for a purpose and every child of God that is born of the spirit of God is a Samson you too are a Nazarite unto God you don't have to be a Samson that floats with the world though and finds the prostitute women like Samson did because Samson would give his strength to God but his heart to Delilah but you can give your strength and your heart to God in fact those who are were sealed by the holy spirit of God do just that every every child of God is a Samson you are an earthshaking devil slaying devil defeating Overcomer amen and you are here sent and predestined for this age and this time to be a deliverer to stand up for Truth for righteousness in your day and your hour every Church movement has been a Samson down through his time is the church um you know is um or the Samson is a type of the Holy Ghost Church laughed at so peculiar but not realizing his peculiarity is it power with God and that's what makes us special amen is that we are set apart set aside chosen amen God called God sent and and and and called To Be A peculiar people a holy nation a righteous people set apart to God now of course you know as we spoke about him in Revelation 1 Jesus walking in the middle of the seven golden candlesticks and he says the in Revelation 2:1 these things said he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of of the seven golden candlesticks you see what he was in the first age he is in all ages so this is why we will pick about a man by the name of Samson and we will look at his life because we're searching the scripture to see that it's just more than stories but that it is actually a prophecy prophesying and we want to look in the scripture and see ourselves in it and and see the manifestation of God in the hour so what God was in the first age he is in all ages to every believer he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what he did once he is still doing and he will keep on doing I'm glad to know that aren't you amen like like he said of these seven Messengers held in his hands they speak and they act upon his authority he stands behind them with all power of God head he's saying I walk amongst the church I am here among you it doesn't matter whether we look back to a man called Samson thousands of years ago and we come forward to our age he's still walking among his children for he says I am with you always and I will be with you to the end of the consummation amen so they are full of the Holy Ghost full of faith on fire with the fire of God stand in there with a purpose amen with with a call in their lives and I want you to understand that every believer is that a people that is called set apart a Nazarite unto the Lord and you don't have to think oh my you don't have to think oh and cry in your heart oh oh if I could have just been back there if I could just been there when angel came down to manoah and his wife and and set apart a man oh if I could have just been there when God would come with Mighty strength upon the church and in another age he moved by the power of God oh if I could only be there there's no need to look back amen you can look up amen but and you can see him that is walking in the midst of the seven churches through all the ages of what he was in the first days here he is in the last days so what you seen him working there in that day in Samson you'll see the same power working in individuals today in the Church of Jesus Christ he's standing there expressing himself what he is his life as a sustainer and The Giver of all give good gifts so we think about that of course without Jesus without his strength and this is what we find about Samson my he he would be moved upon on by the spirit of God but when the spirit left him without him he was just a puny ordinary man overcome so easily are you with me so that's exactly the way it says in the Bible Christ is our life and without him we're just a religious Society we're just a club a meaningless Gathering of people you know it's like a corpse that is bejweled and dressed is still a corpse amen the church no matter what her programs are or what her gracious efforts might achieve without Christ she's a corpse also amen but with him in her midst with him motiv in her she becomes the Wonderman of all amen and his body the fullness of him that filth all in all so what he was when he worked in the First Ages he is even now in this te Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so this is the way that we want to look at it because let me remind you when we look at Samson's life you see a man who with the spirit of God could defeat enemies but without the spirit of God was powerless you see even with Israel there was one difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations and that was God you put God to one side and Israel was like any other nation and when Samson cut off his hair he was like every other man when you put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it so the world and all and the church are all of the same luck just like Jacob Esa Esau the same parents but the spirit of God is what makes the difference I want you to remember we must have his spirit so we search the scriptures in them we think we have eternal life we see what the Holy Spirit did in the Bible here he is doing the same thing today so I want to say to you again you are the Samson today you are called to Triumph to defeat the enemies of God and to deliver his people this is why you're called every age you know would seem to start out like Samson with power and that's the way the church would do the church would start out with power with determination I'm going through Jesus I'm going through only to lose strength to some Delilah and who is that Delilah it's anything or anybody that Woos you away from the power of God that's who it is every age this is repeated as a cycle of Revival and death never fails you you see it in the last day a complete departing from the faith Samson was born to be a Nazarite it was his Covenant with God that gave him his power and in this case the angel appears to his wife and she receives the promise of a child that would deliver Israel and instructions are given to her how to raise his child he was to be a Nazarite set apart consecrated that's what Nazarite means it means a consecrated one the Bible says we are to be nazarites where do you find that in the Bible well let's go to 2 Corinthians 6:14 and he says be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship ha righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion have light with Darkness so what does it mean to be unequally yolked it means to be in a situation that binds you to the decisions and actions of people who have values and purposes incompatible with Jesus values and purpose and what communion had light with Darkness you see light and darkness cannot be in Fellowship Christ and Satan cannot work together Believers and unbelievers cannot work together they cannot Fellowship together and as a Nazarite we are God's temple on Earth since it's Spirit lives in us that's why we must separate ourselves from any kind of formal binding relationship with unbelievers be careful in business relations because you know you you got to know those you're are joining with have the same values amen this is why it's so important for believers to marry other believers you must never marry an unbeliever because it bind you to decisions and actions of people who are have incompatible values and purposes so he goes on to say what Concord had Christ with B that is the devil or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel stay away from those things he's letting you know stay away from those things that you know that the gossip of unbelief watch out and guard yourself who who are always negative toward the Church toward the ministry watch out for bites that are always looking on the backside trying to find a flaw and to do this they're they're just trying to justify their own behavior don't listen to gossip amen you you are Nazarite don't spread gossip you are a Nazarite yeah you hear someone say something hurtful about somebody else don't go run and tell that person and hurt them with it stop it in his tracks shut the gossip up and if you just got to if you just have to repeat it then get that on your knees and repeat it before the Throne of God and let God deal with it you see we are to live holy and to be Sanctified like the priest who went behind the holies of holies and the world was shut off of away from them we are to live a a Sanctified holy life where the world is shut off amen we need we need to realize we need to be like Isaiah was in the temple and say Lord cleanse my lips amen even cleanse my ears that I only hear what the spirit is saying amen for you are the Temple of the Living God listen for verse 16 says what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people amen wherefore wherefore since I'm going to be God they're going to be my Holy Temple I'm going to dwell in them then come out from among them and be ye separate say the Lord and touch not the UN clean thing and I will receive you and will be a father to you and you will be my sons and daughters sayeth the Lord God Almighty amen this is this is him saying you're a Nazarite you are to live a separate life amen you you are nazarit unto God Amen because any man that is born born again when he becomes a Believer he becomes a Nazarite where he separates himself from anything contrary to the word of God this is this was Samson what the angel saying your son is going to be a Nazarite no razor will come on his head he is going to look different there's going to be distinctive qualities about him that are different he's not going to be able to touch anything that is dead he will not touch anything that is unclean he is Holy unto the Lord his life is going to be separate from from touching the the the the The Grapes of the Vine and Wine he he's going to be holy separated unto me you see that's exactly where God calls us to be a church that is Holy separated separated from unbelief from sins and and and the things of the world a church separated from anything that would be uh that would be wrong that would be contr to God's word you as a Nazarite are to live separated life unto the Lord now you may have lived a dirty sinful rotten unconsecrated life you may have smoked drank defiled your body but let me tell you that's your first birth I want to get this to you amen that's your first birth but you have a new birth Earth now just as Samson's parents were visited by the by an Angel at the moment of your new birth a portion of the pillar of fire came into you so where do you get that brother Tim listen The Upper Room amen what happened the the fire of God came and separated himself and a lick of fire Came Upon each one of them amen and it come that Holy Spirit came in you and it burned out without sin nature and you were born again and and at that moment consecrated as one set apart from God let me tell you this this visitation of the Angel to separate you from the from the rest of the world make you a Nazarite is not unique to Samson that's you too I want to get it to you that's you too you have been called selected ordained of God to be separated and an angel of God by the pillar of fire came into you to make you the Temple of the Holy Ghost and you are a clean vessel not an unclean vessel and you're not to defile your body come on you are to live holy righteous because he said I am Holy now so you see you're set apart you know a maybe it's not like what happened at Jesus baptism where a prophet witnessed it and said I saw a Dove came down I saw this here it came down like a dove and and Here It Came Upon him and I saw the Spirit abide maybe a prophet didn't witness it but it happened anyway maybe you didn't see it but it it happened anyway amen you may not have seen it or experiened it but it was an Angelic Heavenly present that Vindicated you and called you out as a set apart one you have been set apart for a purpose now Samson was to have a sign signifying this vow for him it would be his uncut hair and a fe forbidden to touch wine neither was to he eat anything unclean every Christian is to be separated as a Nazarite he is not to partake of strong drink of course he takes communion but not to excess and to keep himself from the world he is certainly not to drink the wine of fornication that is offered by the harlots spoken of in the Bible in Revelation chap 18- 21 we we are Nazarite we are ones that are separated unto God having heard God's clear voice saying come out from among them be you holy for I am holy amen for without Holiness no man shall see the Lord now there have been many nazarites or separated ones throughout the Bible we're just going to talk about them just very very briefly because in a sense Abraham was a Nazarite meaning that he was separated unto God that's for a purpose do you know that every child of a Abraham is a Nazarite with a vow that go that God swore by himself you've been called selected just like Abraham Abraham was a separated person God called him at 75 years old and separated him from his from his uh family and pulled him out and said here you walk with me that's right amen come out and separate yourself and from anything contrary to what you believe you remember they they were believed in multiple gods and Abraham come out and God showed him I'm one Lord here he comes and he reveals himself as the one true and living God and it separates himself from his his family that were Idol worshippers you know and and then he would hold on to a promise of a son and this would set him apart is a man of Faith who would believe the Word of Promise regardless of what the circumstances was even when it got worse he kept believing he was a Nazarite Amen in his own way Aaron was a Nazarite unto the Lord he was separated among his Brethren to Bear the birthstones and to be the high priest Paul was a Nazarite and the Lord he was separated from his Orthodox Church to the word of the Living God even Jesus was a Nazarite not in the s of the vow of touching something from The Grapes but in a sense he was wholly separated under God for a purpose there were other nazarites in the Bible like Samuel and John the Baptist and even today with with brother Brandon we mentioned him a moment ago remember the angel told him Never Smoke never drink don't defile your body in any way I have a work for you to do when you're older when he was in Europe a lot of the religious Elders tried to share with him the German beer and he said no I'm a Nazarite un the Lord I'm separated and I want you to know you are a separated people sir from your new birth you are separated called to be a Nazarite unto the Lord now before before Samson was born God sent an angel to identify his coming Israel had gotten away from God and they cried to God and God gave them a deliverer now Samson didn't have shoulders like a barn door he was no Goliath he was a shorty he was described as a little curly-headed shrimp with Seven Locks everybody probably thought he was a just a mama's boy no doubt the Philistines wonder where does that hidden power come from amen I want you to know we have the same Seven Locks that he had it's the seven spirits of God that manifest itself through seven Church ages and I just want to say ain't no Delilah going to take that away from me like Samson it's our covenant with God it's the secret of our power the holy spirit in every age and we must have him because without him we are powerless we are defeated you know our sisters are given a Nazarite vow the sign of a Nazarite to show they are separated from the world and identified with Christ amen this is why Paul in 1 Corinthians 11 will just list it right down and tell you know of the of the Covenant of the man and the Covenant of the woman and the man is to show of his headship with Christ with his cutting hair and a woman is to show that she is under the submission of her husband which is her head and the head of the man which is Christ so she is under Christ subjection by her uncut hair this is Bible amen how important this identity is people unashamedly today wears every kind of tattoo there is identify with this or that maybe some rock group some some Idol some Stars something some sentimental something that means something to them but what about this identity amen a man looking there standing there as a cleancut individual representing God to his age a woman there standing there representing the Bride of Jesus Christ showing a sign the Bible said is a sign that shows power on her head with by by the angels with uncut hair this is a Bible the Bible the world identifies with the woman Jezebel with her pain and her hair do but the Bible said If a woman cuts her hair she dishonors her head which is her husband and her husband is a head with God so she dishonors God and her husband so you see again we realize that when they cut off their hair they deny the Nazarite vow that I am subject to every word of God who who we we'll be subject to that but not that we we will do this but not that God wants a people wholly separated to him you see a woman that is a child of God lets her hair grow to show she is consecrated to every word of God not just some of it but we believe it all we believe the whole Bible and so this is the word of God the Bible tells you exactly that we exactly in 1 Corinthians 11 he identifies it very clearly you know about the Nazarite vow you be it as a man with with cut hair you women buried as a woman with uncut hair this is Bible this is this is exactly what it's t it shows you're separated unto God under the sign of a covenant that she is under the headship of the word amen the same thing with the church The Church Must Believe every word we're not going to let one word be cut off not one lock a promise amen not one word of God we're going to believe every word of God Amen because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and every word of God is his is of his is truth so sisters God has chosen you to bear in your body the mark of Jesus Christ with uncut hand you're identifying yourself with the bride of Christ who is subject to every word on the other hand Brothers there's a sign on your head of cut hair and it says I'm the head of my home and Christ is my head amen now so you see it's a total separation here we are as Nazarite totally separated from the Fashions of this Modern Age it doesn't matter what the rest of the world is doing we are a Nazarite unto the Lord amen as a husband and wife are one so is the Bride In Christ is one and the word of God lives through her and that's her real identity and that is her credentials so you see the only true credentials is that a Believer has is the word of God is living in them declaring that Jesus lives in them that person amen now so as we as we look about this we we want to remember that every promise of God is true and not One Word of Promise not one truth is to be shaved off we dare not let anyone know our secret or to lay in the lap of the world and shave off our power amen it seems that every church every move of God began with high aspirations they start out with the depth of God and that actual personal experience of the spirit of God dwelling in them where his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through a fresh revelation of the word but lurking around is that attraction some Philistine girl some persuasion to make a sub stitute for this reality of God how does Satan do this he takes away the knowledge of the truth of God and destroys the word by putting for forth his own yeah hath God said so using quotes to fight quotes he makes the word of God ineffective amen for example the church started out strong and everybody knew knew to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ everybody knew it Peter did it with the keys on the day of Pentecost at the house of Cornelius they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus amen in later on in the scripture again at Samaria they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus in Acts chapter 19 they were commanded to be re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so everybody knew and that's how all the apostles baptized all the disciples believed in one God there's no was no such thing as trinitarians amen not until three centuries after the church when when got deceived by Delilah amen the word had come they rejoice in his truth But Then There Rose up factions who cut God into three and made a trinity of gods but originally everybody everybody knew to that to be baptized in his name when you're married you take on the name of your husband when you're born you take on the name of your father when you're born in the kingdom of God you take on the name of God Amen not a title but the name of God Amen your name isn't when you get married your name isn't husband you don't go take on the name husband you take on the name of whoever you married amen when you when you're born you don't take on the name of Father well well you know what what's the name what's his child's name father no his name isn't father he takes on the name of his of his father don't take on a title takes on his name everybody knew that to start out with everybody knew to be identified with Jesus Christ they also realize that salvation is not passed on by natural birth and let me just say to you again this morning you we cannot pass on the new birth just because you're born in the church so well I believe the message well so does the devil that's right amen no the new birth is an experience and everybody knew it was an experience amen nobody wondered at the birth of the church on the inauguration on the day of Pentecost nobody wondered did somebody come up and join the church did they shake hands with the pastor and say we're going to say the Apostles Creed did they come down to the Altar and say stick out your tongue we'll put a a wafer on it and the priest drink your wine did he do any of that no what happened on the day of Pentecost what happened an experience an experience of what the pillar of fire come gave a lick a portion gave birth that's right gave a lick of himself and came and dwelt in them so the nobody was confused about church joining or just being born into the church I was raised in the m so I believe it nobody had I got the Holy Ghost cuz I believe the message you don't have the Holy Ghost cuz you got to believe the message you get you have the Holy Ghost cuz he the person came down into you and burned out sin and made a child of God out of you that's how you believe the truth amen and that's how you're born again but you know we laid in the lap of Delilah and played with harlots until its thought because your parents raised you as a Believer and you embraced its thoughts that you just automatically feel with the spirit because you believe the fundamentals of the message and you'd receive the Holy Ghost the thought is that by natural birth you were born into the family of God and accepted in the church and that's why listen carefully that's why we have people who are unfamiliar with the super natural because they've been born without it nothing happened supernaturally when they were born I got born again nothing happened spirit of God came into me but nothing happened that's not the way it was in Acts 2 that's not the way when it originally come that's not the way at House of Cornelius that's not the way it was in Acts 19 there's no example in the scripture that anybody ever got the Holy Ghost and didn't know it you see you know so therefore you know when when when we have churches that come about I hesitate to say born but born and they were born without Supernatural then the gifts of the Spirit and the signs of the Supernatural are trivialized belittled and deemed as unnecessary altar calls become mocked prayer lines ridiculed amen casting out Devils replaced with psychology with man's reasoning of how to restrain wrong Behavior like Samson the church sought out strange women women not of the Covenant for comfort for consolation for company you see the seeds of unbelief start out small and innocent and it sounds good and reasonable like like taking John 14:12 and planted is only as in a prophet's Ministry and yet that truth became distorted because indeed it was a description of a prophetic Ministry yeah amen The Works of Jesus Christ worked in that Ministry amen we undeniably saw John 14:12 work in that Ministry we saw the ministry of Jesus Christ repeat as the son of man revealed himself and was identified among us but well don't we realize that Jesus said this not of himself but of the book of Acts that would follow amen and that William Brandon for example certainly lived out the ministry of Jesus Christ as we saw Jesus on display amen we and if we saw Jesus on display in brother Brandon's Ministry then that follows that there must be a book of Acts follow that Ministry that the same works that Jesus did through the prophetic Ministry works in the bride amen so look what he does he takes there with this smooth talk think of think of the Perfection that is Promised in 1 Corinthians 13 that when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part is done away the Glorious Perfection brother that's a glorious Perfection which will one day be achieved by the church and it'll be in glorified bodies think of that amen where we will no longer need prophecy to know the future we will need no longer need to to know the future because there's no yesterdays or tomorrows there Amen in the Heaven's Perfection no one will uniquely speak in a Heavenly tongue think about that you know if if if unknown tongues to your ears that spoke in the church you automatically know that's speaking in tongues but when you go to heaven they ain't going to be you hearing speaking in tongues everybody will be speaking in tongues they will everyone be speaking in a Heavenly language they won't be speaking English and Dutch and Hebrew they'll be speaking in Heavenly language are you with me so all will speak with tongues so you see we will all have it'll never it won't be unique in heaven it's Unique here but it won't be unique there however while we're waiting for that glorified body of perfection as Immortals right now yet mortal and imperfect in truth we have we already have the perfect word by Divine in interpretation amen that and that should mean to us then that having just part of it is done away with and that no promise of God is excluded amen that means the word is not perfect and complete unless it has working of Miracles Gifts of healing faith and tongues and interpretation and prophecy it's not complete nor perfect in operation without Holy Spirit leadership of spiritual dreams and Visions that's but Samson the church has sunk down in the arms of a spirit who offers false Comfort she has but one aim and that is to take away your power like Delilah she Sues and she Comforts us for not having the supernatural working you know she Whispers In Your Ear you don't need it Samson you don't need the strength give give your strength to me you don't need it give me the secret of it give it up you have me and the deceiver wants to take prophecies and visions and means of God communicating his thought and plans to us and make them obsolete because he can replace it with a new way of just in elction the message and that now is the perfect way therefore the supernatural power is not needed anymore you see it's like the serpent saying yeath God said oh yeah God said the time will come when the church won't need its strength you you see you just have this concept of the word you you really don't need the strength you don't really need the power you you don't need your strength Samson give me your secret you you see you won't need you no longer need a Heavenly language of prayer where intercession is done through the spirit speaking things which cannot be uttered you won't need Divine Healing and laying on a hands and sick to follow those that believe every gift has now been laid on the shf and Delilah Whispers these words these sweet nothings like True Believers now listen Samson True Believers are without signs because we now have the word knowledge is all you need not power so lay your power down Samson just give it over to me relax lay your head in my lap and sleep you see the devil doesn't want our salvation to have power so he convinces the church you got salvation without power you're saved but you still fornicate you you're saved in the Holy Ghost filled got the token ready to go to heaven and you're still a porn addict you're saved but there is no prayer life no consecrated walk you see but no spiritual dreams or visions you you see never but never mind it it it just shows you you're perfect because you got great knowledge and the proof of you're so mature you're so grown up is because you don't need the Supernatural cuz grown-ups don't need those baby things see you look like a baby Samson with that hair you look like a mama's girl or Mama's Boy you know you don't need that you don't need speaking in tongue you don't need prophecy you don't need healings Miracles are only for the immature tongues are baby talk signs you don't need them you're wise what I have gives you great wisdom I say wake up Samson I say isn't Christ the same come on wasn't the apostolic age never to cease amen wasn't it for as many as our Lord God shall call wake up Samson amen the the world wants to take away your power no you don't need that strength you don't give it to me just give me your secret give up that hidden power power you see the days of that are passed since we have the word now the other is not needed it was only to vindicate a prophet that's all his ministry but once the word is Vindicated we don't need Vindication well well then what about the ministry of our Lord Jesus he brought the gospel and it was Vindicated how many can say he had a Vindicated Ministry God vindicating Jesus needed no further Vindication especially when he raised up over the over the out of the death into out of the Tomb you know Jesus need no further Vindication but true believers do Jesus don't need anymore but you do we don't have to have another sign to vindicate William brandham but you need Vindication amen True Believer because he said these signs shall follow them that believe and will vindicate them so you see this smooth talk it seems so inefficient just let you guard down lay your head in my lap like that Spirit of error that was allowed to grow in the Ephesian age and started as a seemingly in offensive seed of a tear and would choke out the wheat it's a seat of discrepancy so the church he wants to make you lukewarm formal cold and Powerless remember that's the whole thing he wants to take your power away somebody wants to try to add to the word or take from it you see you don't find those things in the prophet's message you don't see those things of no altar calls and no prayer lines you you you hear the prophet saying I want an oldfashioned alter call cuz God still works in them you don't hear the prophet saying those thing it's men who have taken with the spirit of Delilah to twist it to smooth talk you to take away your power cuz he don't want the power working in the church so it comes under cover with one little deviation from that word is a step away from Christ I want you to never forget your strength comes because of your Covenant between you and God it was made at your birth not so much your natural birth but through that through that which was pre-planned by God God Amen and so it's you are Covenant to him and Samson was God's deliverer for Israel his name was feared among the Philistines and so we ought to lift up the name of Jesus above our enemies amen they won't have nothing to fear if we don't use it amen there ought to be a church today on the rise that says we are the Samson of the Lord man and we have the name of Jesus that we're lifting and that name is feared by every demon power because in the name of Jesus Christ every demon has to P bow every Spirit has to flee Samson if he could just feel those Seven Locks he would know he was in the Covenant now Samson took a wife and was robbed of her and they gave her to another man now all of this happened so that he would have an occasion against the Philistines and Samson didn't found another occasion against the Philistines and and and they made him angry and I'll just tell you this I'd like to see the church get angry I'd like to see the church get angry when the devil steals our joy when the Devil comes and take away our PE I'd like to see the church get angry something rise up within them when we see the devil come in and and break apart marriages of young men and women and drag them out into the world I'd like to see people get angry angry enough to call Heaven down angry enough to rise up against sin and unrighteousness and rebuke it standing for truth I'd like to see the church angry I'd like to see an emotion rise of anger when the sick isn't healed God you made a promise I'm not angry at God but I'm angry at this stubborn devil that won't turn loose amen there needs to be somebody angry enough as brother Brandon one time yelled yelled there when he was casting out a devil he said now I'm not yelling at you but he said you know sometimes you just have to get mad at the Devil that's right and something Rises up in me I get a a letter from a little lady said I want to meet you brother Tim in Ohio when you're when you're there here in a few weeks I want to bring my daughter she she's possessed she got a terrible dis learning uh a learning disorder and she can't function and she's being bullied and everything else and she's so defeated and she's crying all the time I need some help I tell you what I get angry I think God what if that was my little girl what if that was my granddaughter what if that was my loved one when we hear of Elders being attacked by the devil when we hear of Ministers of the Gospel who have given their lives like brother Ron and there the devil is attacked him with a blow after blow after blow it ought to make a church angry angry enough to start tormenting Devils angry enough to start calling fire down out of Heaven angry enough to start moving against the powers of the of Darkness or the church oh that the church would once again make Satan tremble rather than trembling because of the devil the name Samson Samson that name would spark fear Samson's here that name would spark Terror in the hearts of the enemy Samson oh no Samson's come that's the way it ought to be with the Church of Jesus Christ she ought to spark Terror in the heart of Satan and all of his fallen angels in Hell there ought to be something rise up amen of fear within them you talk about us fear and and I see young people under the spirit of fear and the spirit of bondage let me tell you we ought to be making the devil the one to fear that he fears the Church of the Living God who realizes their power who realize their calling Who real eyes they have been sent in this last day to torment the devil oh that's a church again Samson Samson let me tell you what he did I don't know how he did it I mean you know if you believe any of the Bible you might as well well believe it all I reading somebody the other day saying well we don't believe in Moses we believe he's a fictitional person and it never happened well I do I believe in Moses I believe in Samson I Believe In Jonah like the little girl said you know to to an Infidel who who saw her coming home from church said you believe that Bible said yeah I believe it I believe every word of it said well what about that been there were a whale swallowed Jonah you know a whale can't swallow a man said don't you said well I'll tell you what I'll do when I get to heaven I'll just ask Jonah she said he said to her what if it is he isn't there so well then you'll have to ask him amen but nevertheless Samson Samson here he he went and caught 300 foxes now I've heard of Trappers before but this was a Trapper and I don't know how he caught them all alive but he tied two of them tail to tail and put a fire brand on their tails and let them go through the Vil sign's corn and it burned up their shocks of corn their standing corn their Vineyards and their Olive Groves brother he did it he was angry he was enough angry that he actually tore down the Philistine Kingdom and took away their food I tell you what we ought to take away the things that are feeding the devil in our lives amen he went and caught three under foxes tied them together let them loose burn it up i' say burn up hell burn up sickness burn up unbelief burn up the spirits of Darkness we are the sons and daughters of the most high God the samsons called in this age Philistines came after Samson and Israel and guess what Israel turned against him ain't that about right here the here the Philistines come after Samson for burning up their corn burn you know setting their fields on fire so now they all gathered against them and they come up and say we want Samson and Israel says we'll give him to you now is that something here's a man who's standing there destroying their enemy and they want to take sides with the enemy is it something you preach Divine heal and the gifts of the Spirit and the moving of the Holy Ghost and people want to blast you amen they they they want to mock you and make fun of you they want they want to they want to join with the Enemy against the moving of the Holy Spirit you know so but you see Samson's People Israel betrayed him to the Philistines I tell you what that's an awful Judas when it comes from your own people that's what happened that's why Judas was so bad he came from jesus' Inner Circle amen the Judas was one of his own Deacon trustees one of the in the very Inner Circle in this biblical account of Samson you see Israel wanted peace at any cost they were content with false peace under Philistine dominion and they said to Samson knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us how come Israel how come that ain't the Bible that ain't the promise of God that ain't what he was told by Joshua to do you go take the land and dispossess them amen you're to rule over them they're not to rule over you but Samson don't you know don't you know the Philistines are rulers over us how come how come are we happy with pornography ruling over our kids how come we're happy and satisfied to live with less than what God provided come on somebody amen why in the world isn't it amazing that many of God's people are content to be ruled by the Philistines they're too happy to be a slave to their lust to their flesh to the world to the devil God's people should want to be free it ought to burn in Freedom ought to burn in the hearts of of every not just Americans every child of God Amen they a freedom ought to burn in your heart amen we want God we want real peace because real peace and deliverance would come when the church like Samson fulfilled God's plan to deliver Israel from the Philistine rule but instead all of a sudden all of us said well you've done broke Church order you've done this you've done that and so you know they bound him they bound him you see there can only be peace real peace in the land when the church is Victorious our Victory is through the Lord Jesus Christ there is no Victory otherwise he is our peace don't settle for a false peace don't compromise with the Enemy don't surrender your faith as Israel surrendered Samson to the Philistines don't surrender your hope don't let the devil steal your health amen don't let him take your peace or your joy amen don't lay down your Bible don't swap God's word for something inferior amen don't settle for anything less than the Lord Jesus Christ and for every promise of his look the land is ours it is Satan that is the Invader do you hear me don't give up your land to the enemy there you know even even today there is no such thing as a Palestine that's right there's a place called Israel amen there's no such thing as Palestinians just Arabs Arabs who are Invaders who want to steal the land of promise from God's people who are the legal owner that's right amen the president of Israel just said recently in his Memorial Day speech we never forget that there is no greater commandment than redeeming captives think of that no greater commandment than redeeming captives that ought to be the motto of the church no greater commandment like I said you know that every Church ought to cast out Devils amen we should cast them out out of lives out of hearts for salvation to come it comes by casting out Devils come on somebody amen and there's no greater commandment than redeeming captives the entire nation is with you we must Summit summon courage and choose life not to rest not to stop until they all return home and I say how can we forget those who are captive how can we forget those who are captive by cancer a hostage with horrible struggles how can we forget those that are bound tormented sick or lame how can we forget all of those that are being held hostage I think I think there in the Bible in in Isaiah 61 where the Bible said he came to set the captive free and he did it by opening the eyes of the Blind by Healing The Sick amen from delivering from those who were in prison and and setting people free let me tell you when you have salvation in a church it's setting captives free salvation can be on the body realm or the spirit realm amen whatever it is it's it is setting the captive free it should be our highest calling no greater Commandment that set captives free so how can we forget how can we forget it's time to set captives free the world wants us wants to keep us from rough those demonic strongholds of unbelief that's what the devil wants to do he wants he don't want us hunting down those demons that are holding our people captive and destroying and and and destroying our our friends they want they want they don't want us they don't want us destroying the enemy they want him to live to fight another day and I just tell you like Samson sometimes you have to stand alone Samson was alone and you may be standing alone today you you may have battles and struggles and difficulties like Samson did and Samson was just a fallible human being like every one of us but let me tell you the key is not in yourself the key is not in your power your strength but it's in putting forth your hand and taking the Jawbone of an ass that doky that Jawbone that God Prov fighted here he was now 3,000 men of Judah came and bound him and a thousand men of the Philistines come to take him took 3,000 to bind him and 1,000 Philistines thought they would liberate him I and take him I mean hold him captive and Samson took him burst those bands and he steps out and he looks and he has no weapon and he looks down and he sees a Jawbone I want you to think of this because we can all identify with Samson one way or the other capable of such strength yet such weakness Victorious One Moment defeated the next it's a true picture of the church Victorious and defeated the cycle of Revival and death has never failed but somebody's got to defeat the enemy and the Bible said in judges 1515 he found a new jaw bone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men with it I don't know when the first man got killed with it why they didn't all start running and especially the dummies after 10 20 30 40 50 a Jawbone how in the world would you face a thousand men armed in dangerous with a Jawbone Samson faces a thousand Philistine on his own without Israel's help and he prevailed using something that is a humble almost seemingly stupid weapon this is more than a neat story of a superhero this is a prophecy this is speaking of the church it's talking about the hidden power of God it's talking about what lays in your hands it's talking about a feeble what seem ly is a feeble weapon but in the hand of a man of God Amen under the strength of God can defeat the enemy taking the word of God and defeating the enemy anywhere any place at any time amen you see our prayers also seem weak and feeble against demon powers they look weak when they spoke against demon cancers the word of God looks fragile against modern science the jawbones seemingly would shatter with Splinter or break apart in the face of critics but the weapons of God that God provides they they many times look ridiculous to the human mind you know it was Moses that had a staff in his hands riding on a mule or a donkey heading back to Egypt with a staff in his hand and he would take said Moses what are you doing I'm going to go and defeat the mightiest army in the world what are you going to use this Rod come on shamgar had an ox goat which which he killed 600 Philistines Samson had a Jawbone and slew a thousand Philistines David had a sling a string with a piece of leather and a stone that he killed a mighty Giant Goliath with you see that's what it is that where you see a Jawbone what about it what about that jaw bone the Jawbone represents any promise of the word of God it represents Jesus The Living Word the Bible the written word our victory over the pH in our lives come when we use the Jawbone of a donkey to defeat them these things look insignificant until it's wielded in the hand of Faith the Jawbone of Promise is ineffective against those who dominate us even those besetting sins the Bible tells you in Ephesians 6:12 we wrestle not against against flesh and blood but against rulers against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and we got the victory we got the Jawbone but we have to take our hand take it in our hands you're surrounded by a thousand Philistines but there is a job on there don't don't disregard it you got the most powerful weapons there is right at your disposal amen you've got prayer and you've got the word of God Amen you you may know the message of the Bible but unless you take what it's saying and lay hold on it somebody somebody's got to take hold of a promise somebody's got to take hold of Mark 16 somebody's got to take a hold of John 14:12 somebody got to say the spirit of God's in the bride of Christ and she knows what to do with the word somebody's got to take a hold of it the jaw bones laying there is for you to take a hold of it's a promise laying there in the word what is it is it a heart belief or a head belief is it a head knowledge that even Devils have or do we have a heart knowledge have we as our hearts been turned back to Faith again somebody's got to realize we are the Malachi four Believers whose Hearts have been restored back to the faith of the fathers somebody got to stand up for righteousness in this day and call Sin Sin and wrong wrong and right right somebody's got to stand for truth somebody's got to take a hold of the job B that's right it may look ridiculous it may look stupid it may look it may me look crazy but somebody's got to be crazy for God most was crazy for God going down to Egypt with a stick amen David was crazy for God going out with a slingshot amen you got to be crazy for God come on taking any promise of the word and and taking against the the heart of the enemy the Jawbone represented God's appointed weapon and I'll tell you God gave us a weapon it's the message of the hour amen the Bible said Samson found it it was crude rude let me say sometimes it came in Kentucky English but God provided it amen we're predestinated to it and like Samson we just have to take it take it Samson didn't refuse it he he saw the Seas this JW bone and put forth his hand and took it just like we do we we have to take it forth with our hand put forth our hand and take hold of our deliverance we have to receive what God has done for us amen those of you seeking the spirit of God you know there again you can cry day and night and day and night until I'm old and totally feeble but you got to take it you got to take the Word of Promise You cannot just say oh well it's there you must say it it's mine if it's Divine Healing you must say it's mine amen if it's a struggle that you have in the world with the lust of the flesh or the lust of the eye or the pride of life you got to say I've got a a weapon I am not defenseless but I've got a weapon amen I want victory in my life over Satan the World the Flesh then I'm taking putting forth my hand and I'm taking the word of God and I'm saying it's mine it's mine to defeat the enemy with and I know if I pray according to the word I'm praying according to his will and I'll have answered prayer it's the word yes sir you say well brother Tim how do we pray with the word well it's the word I would that you'd prosper in health as your soul prospers that's the word it's the word that he is our peace it's the word that he will Champion our cause amen did you did you notice the jaw bone was new you know brother Bram always referring to the Jawbone we say it's an old Jawbone was he de disagreeing with the Bible no I don't think he was I'm saying I think it was old in that the promises are Eternal and from Everlasting but when we pick them up they are new pick up that new jaw bom let the word become flesh and anointed to you the Bible said he would give us the sure mercies of David you see they were old mercies but when given to us they are new mercies come on the mercies of David are old but when they're given to you they're new so what does it mean a new Jawbone it's kind of like the Mana that was fresh every day the Jawbone the word of God is living and written is always flesh is always alive because Jesus is Alive and his body didn't corrupt in the Tomb and he raised from the dead and he passed in the heavens and he seated at the right hand of God and and the words of Jesus never get stale that's right amen the Bible tells us in of Israel in numbers 21 how that they spoke against God and against Moses saying why have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness here there's no bread there's no water and our soul loatheth this light bread this angel food this Mana from heaven was new every morning but it had become old to them I'm taking examples even this morning I'm taking examples and promises that are old an ancient story of a man by the name of Samson and bringing to you them fresh this morning old mercies the mercies of David the mercies of Abraham the mercies of Jesus become new every morning when taken in the hand of faith I wonder sometimes are we weary of the Mana of God's word or you know Wednesday night and and then back to church Sunday and I've heard that before and I you know I just read Facebook forget the old book of the Bible and you're too bound up with daily life to read it I I say shed shred those bounds and find something new the things that had bound s and he had to shred them and reach down to something new it was it was a new job B you know maybe you should just get right with God maybe you've fallen out of fellowship with him maybe because of some unconfessed sin that's separating you from your God you have forgotten where your power comes from maybe you've lost your first love and God calls for repentance you should ask for it and God is faith ful to forgive and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and his word is life to the believer and God's word is a living oh is living water in Psalms 46 it says there is a river and the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high so you see we are the we are the city of God we are the Tabernacles of the most high the spirit of God dwells in us who have been really born again and I just say never ever stray from that River Jesus is the source when you leave Jesus you leave the source when you leave the Holy Spirit when he's no longer in the life when he's no longer in the church when he's no longer in the songs when he's no longer in the preaching we've lost everything Jeremiah 2:13 said my people have Comm committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Water and they've shwed Out Sister broken sistens that can hold no water you know too many worship god of their own imagination a Jesus of their own creation a Jesus that will excuse you of sin and a sinful lifestyle that justifies your Li Your Lust and your your covetousness your greed and your envy and the Bible speaks about another Jesus another gospel and I wonder today have we as a church forsaken the gospel the true Gospel of the Lord Jesus and he heed out their own sisters and this is exactly the indictment that came from the prophet of God they are broken sisters that hold no water but you see he tells you return to the Fountain of Living Water yes sir amen think about that Jawbone as we type it with the written word of God God's word the Bible is a the Jawbone may seem stupid and and and offensive to Samson and so the Bible will seem stupid and offensive to so many it's foolishness the Bible said the preaching of the Cross is foolishness to the unbeliever but to us it's the power of God hey man here they look down whip us with what a stupid J come on get real Samson he was for real amen he was for real there he reached down and gets this Jawbone something that seems impossible but all things are possible to them that believe oh if we could get the church believe it nothing would stand before our prayers if we get to church believing act two happens again amen if we get to church beli the spirit of God begins to move out doubt fear unbelief darkness and demons go to running when the church begins to believe the Jawbone was from a donkey you know the donkey is an humble simple servant animal it's taken for granted like being so reliable and able to carry so many burdens they use them over in the East over there one day there was a Prophet by the name of balum and there was a donkey that saved his life he was a greedy prophet he was on his way down to curse Israel Bayo was paying him lots of money and on his way he would have died but God opened the mouth of his donkey which he was Mercy beating him and it stopped and the donkey donkey stopped right in the way and fell down because it saw the angel of the Lord with his sword drawn standing the way and Bam couldn't see it his eye was too much on the success he was going to have and the money that he would get and the the price he was being given and God opened a donkey's mouth and the Bible said that dumb donkey rebuked balum for his Madness the donkey saw the angel of Lord while balam could not see because of all of his greed and the donkey spoke the truth she had been loyal to balam all his life and the donkey saved the about balam's life and and and got for the wrath of his anchor let me tell you God's word is the Jawbone of a donkey don't take the donkey for for granted like balum did the donkey does a lot for you and you may not realize it God's word saves us from death God's word speaks the truth God's word is faithful and loyal God's word Bears the ridicule the scoffing the mockery God's word is humble and God's word Bears witness of Jesus Christ who himself took on the form of a servant and bear our sins in his own body on a tree Who Bore the sins of the world and by whose stripes we are healed think about that we have the truth today and the truth has always been persecuted this message is always unwelcome it's a it's it's it's light rejected and yet it carries such Authority it it gives such Victory and and the it's it is our faith in the word of God that gives us victory over the world it's there we forsake our opinions we forsake our thoughts our imaginations our devices our and we submit to God's humble word and we fall at his feet is dead realizing how worthless the praed and incapable we are the donkey the donkey the job on a donkey will save your life it's God's word it saved balam's it save Samson it'll save you I'm telling you the word of God will save you the word of God sees like the donkey sees what we don't see it reveals what we can't see is a mouthpiece for God it carries God's message and when we read it it's God's word to us amen it's the written word but you got to take it it looks old but it's new amen it's from Everlasting it's ageless but when you take it it's new it's new Mercy this new word it's a word there against your enemy that you can take today but you know what Samson after he finished fighting his enemy you know what he did he threw the job on his side Victorious thousand he writes a poem about his victory you can read it in the Bible he writes a poem about it and he forgot it was the spirit of the Lord and the provision of a job bone that had given him the victory he Cast Away the job on thinking I'm done with it and the Bible said immediately he he was sore of thirst that's I I'll tell you what friends you never need to throw away the jaw bone amen you you may have a great victory in your life and be victorious but it wasn't you you didn't defeat cigarettes you didn't defeat that alcohol you didn't defeat that porn you didn't Fe come on you didn't Fe defeat that fornication and that adulterous Spirit you didn't do it he did it we got to remember where our strength came from but he threw it away he's done with it well I've had my victory I'm a Christian now I'm a Believer look at all the GI the giants look at all the Philistines I killed I don't need it and the Bible said he was sore at thirst let me tell you there's never a time we're done with the word we are never independent of God we need him every moment he is strong when we are weak the Jawbone was a source of Living Water oh yes and so is Jesus amen he's a source of Living Water oh I remember him standing there you know sometimes when Jesus preached he was quiet and he taught other times he preached and when he did he screamed out and said If any man thirst let him come to me and drink he is the thirst quencher for the Thirsty Soul you see the soul there that is deep in sin and and doing every kind of wrong things why they're doing it because they're thirsty thirsty human beings trying to satisfied with the world with sin with the with Darkness they're thirsty but God comes and he's The Thirst quencher but how easily we cast the Jawbone away in the moment we get Victory is easy to forget we get so proud of ourselves we don't you know people get so proud they don't need Church they get so proud they don't need a pastor no more they don't even need other Christians pride is so stupid pride is so deceitful it raises up its ugly head in so many way it's just hard for people to let it go we have nothing and we are nothing just like Samson was Samson's an ordinary man he has no superpowers he had no big muscles he didn't have shoulders like a barn he was a whiy little kid curly-headed shrimp a nothing you're nobody you're nothing and this the way Samson was he had no power on his own it was when the spirit of the Lord came upon him don't we realize church that's the way it is unless the spirit comes what good does it do to even assemble unless the spirit comes what does it do to sing the fanciest song and play the most beautiful music unless the spirit comes amen we got to have him that's what about your own life you may claim oh I'm a Believer I tell you I've been in many many years but without the spirit lukewarm cold and Powerless what is the church oh we're we're mess we received the mightiest message the greatest word I tell but without the spirit what's it going to do so you see he had no Spirit no superpowers he had no strength except by the spirit so don't Cast Away your confidence don't Cast Away Your god-given Weapon It's also the source of Living Water the words are living water why why am I saying this because when when this happened here you know Samson after fighting this battle he became so thirsty and he was about to die and he cried out to God and God opened up a hollow in the Jawbone and out of there came water and it revived his thirsty soul I'll tell you that's exactly what it is in the promises don't cast it away because you're going to need it to revive yourself to get strength again to go on to fight another battle amen drink from it Jesus commanded us to keep his word to keep his Commandments both to obey them physically and spiritually and we're not just surrender the sword of the spirit we're not surrender the word and God caved a hollow in the gelon say well brother Tim we're great message Believers we don't need refreshing we don't need Revival we don't need nothing from the presence of God we got it all we've received it I'll tell you what you know we we are mature and anointed people that are you know with Anointed with this great knowledge that we have received we don't need refreshing I tell you what we can go out and fight devils and we're strong as ever oh really Jesus needed refreshing after he faced the devil on the Mount of Temptation the Bible said Angels Came and strengthened him I'll tell you what that's what we need today we need the Heavens to open we've been in a great battle against the God of this evil age and we need the heavens are open and angels to send and descend upon the son of man and the and the glory of God to come down and stength in us it was Elijah when he got under a juniper tree he had had a great Victory and then ran for his life and was found under a juniper tree and it was there in that place that an angel refreshed him is it time we get a refreshing any it time we're the church we may be Samson we may be strong we may do the do the Lord's battles we we may have had great victories but we need a refreshing I'm looking at men and women that I know are stward Christians but I also know they need a refreshing I know they need to take the very thing that they slew the enemy with and be refreshed and a fresh eye pouring of the Holy Ghost come down upon them and make them alive in the spirit of God once again Samson was so thirsty of famished about to die but it thrown away what he just needed I think about Jesus Jesus is one who life given water came from when he was pierced and from his side and blood and water came forth from him and said my God my God why has I forsaken me what was that that was the shepherd being smitten that was the one who was given his life for the sins of the world where he would abolish the the sacrificial systems in the sacrifice of himself and as a perfect sinless sacrifice for sins uh uh there he enabled the the Waters of life to flow freely and everything we are and all the strength we have is because what he did that's why we must never forget Calvary the fountain was open that day at Calvary and it washes away our sins it saves us and keeps us clean for Samson that Jon was both an instrument of death and an instrument of life so is what we have what will you do with this Jesus called Christ for some it carries a message of judgment and condemnation but for others that will take it it's the good news amen it's life to everyone we ought to take forth our hand this morning and take a hold of the promise here here again in this great Victory we ought to stand today and say it doesn't really matter how much the devil has beat us down with every kind of sickness we take the promise of the word of God and say that we believe and and we hold on to that promise and when we pray we present the token with our prayer amen this this token is a powerful weapon it's the holy ghost that you have to present that I am a blood wash bloodb son of the daughter of the Living God Amen if Satan tries to hand you something like sickness you just take your token and apply it but you know Samson Samson kepts playing with harlots he got in the lap of Delilah the devil determined to know her strength know his strength where did your strength come from tell me your secret Samson types the church it got bound with cords broke them Luther came out Bound Again Wesley come out Bound Again hereza movement finally in that last zza movement they cut off his hair the power was taken away the devil began to afflict and he was just like any other man and there he was the devil's no friend of yours he'll take you and you'll grind he'll blind you and you will grind at the devil's meal he will take you out and promise you every kind of thing in there is in the world but you'll wind up Drive grinding food for the devil round and around and around but I want you to remember Samson was a type of the real church and in that moment in that time where that he was in this horrible condition his hair started growing there is a promise that says I will restore sayeth the Lord a new crop is going on that that is the very hope of the church if there's ever going to be a Rapture it'll be because there is a church who is restored of people who have the power again a people who know their God and do exploits I want you to know there they took him out began to make fun of him Samson now becomes a name of derision Samson oh Samson they afflict him they beat him they make him do tricks they do all things and finally they got enough from that and let him alone for a minute and he said to his little boy that was guiding him around said take me to where the two post are that holds up this building putting my hands on each post and he said oh God remember your Covenant look down and see your word your word says I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing your word it says that they that are alive and remain it will not hinder those that are asleep look here look the mahar's growing out my Covenant is coming back the seals have been taken up off and the whole book is open and the Bible is ours and every promise is and there he begin to say Lord avin me of my eyes and what my enemy has done and I tell you we ought to say Satan you have defeated the church all the way down to the ages and to the time and they turn back into systems and denomination and whatever else but you're going to get paid back amen because the last defeat there will be more die of the Philistines and what all that what all the rest of the church did we're going to have the greatest victory in the last day Hallelujah the greatest Victory comes at the end time but we will not see death but we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and defeat death itself Hallelujah and he began to feel and he said Lord avenge me of my enemies and he began to cry out just once more Lord other that's the church do it again you moved in the past move again you healed in the past heal again you delivered God's people in the past deliver again just once more Lord amen and the Samson there begin to scream out just once more Lord and he and he said I he realized he was going to have to die in order to receive this and you're going to have to die to your pride to your ambition to your own ways you're going to have to surrender your all give up that lukewarmness and that coldness that you have Lord God and cry out to him and say just once more God let me feel your spirit amen and all of a sudden the fibers of his being began to swell something begin to happen I tell you here's a fiber here and there's a fiber there and there's a fiber there and there's of fire oh if it would all get filled with the Holy Ghost and the fire of God move in the church again and you would see the spirit of God deliver God's people amen we ought to be crying out this morning like the church just once more Lord that's our cry let us receive of your spirit why don't you bow your heads together with me this morning and you just say God what have I done with this Jesus called Christ what am I doing with the message what am I doing am I so easily discarding the word am I throwing it down let me Lord today defeat my enemy before he defeats me I realize I got to be a church that is calling out to God just once more that's willing to take what is foolish regarded as nothing the word of God the promises and take them and defeat our enemy he made you to be a Nazarite it's those things that are Unholy unrighteous that separate you from your God I'm asking you today in your own life in your own heart but you're ready to come back and say Lord I want to be an Nazar right again I let the enemy cut off my power comes as a thief to Rob and to kill and destroy but you come that we might have life and life more abundantly Lord I've Cast Away the very thing that could give me Victory The Word of Promise but today I want to drink from it maybe you look in your own life this morning you can just say just once more Lord I've felt your presence before I've seen your power before but just once more will you just come will you come into my life maybe there' be a hand that go up to God and say Lord help me I've grown cold I've Cast Away what is most precious maybe I haven't drunken from it I need a Revival maybe you in your own Spirit could say I need a Revival I need that water from a Jawbone I need to be revived again I want to consecrate my life and be holy again w't be separated to the Lord are you willing are you ready I many can say I believe I'm part of that new crop new crop of hair that's growing strength coming back into the body and I'm just saying just once more Lord just once more Lord pour your spirit out on me once more Lord sanctify me Lord cleanse me fill me with your spirit give me a charge Lord that takes the world in sin and darkness makes me separated and holy to you oh God I pray that you'll bless you people under the sound of my voice and those that are listening Lord by the way of Internet that you'll speak to them right now you'll touch hearts and lives touch your people once again Lord May oh God they be a part of this great move where they say just once more Lord I hear it cried out in the prophetic Ministry in this last day went around to the country from New York to Chicago down to sort over over into Arizona in Jeffersonville everywhere saying just once more Lord there is a hope Lord when I look at it sometimes get so discouraged I realize there's a hope there is a hope I look here in the scripture and said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and I look there and I look at Samson mistake after mistake feeble human being helpless without you and comes back to you in that last moment saying just once more Lord Lord will you look upon the locks today will you look down lord on your people see the hair is growing will you remember your promise we remember your promise that in the last days I'll pour out my spirit sayith God will you remember your promise that there will be times of refreshing sent from the presence of the Lord will you remember your promise will you remember your promise Lord I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing will you remember your promise and bring healing and deliverance to your children oh God remember your promise today look down lord and see there's a new
