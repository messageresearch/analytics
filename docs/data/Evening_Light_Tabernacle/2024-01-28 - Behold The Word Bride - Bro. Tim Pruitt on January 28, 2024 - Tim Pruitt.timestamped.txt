[22:41] of our assembly where we just concluded
[22:43] our second annual Youth Camp bringing
[22:46] together Saints from a total of nine
[22:48] countries this has been one of a kind
[22:52] young people Gathering from all over I
[22:54] believe I would be justified to say that
[22:57] these were Supernatural meetings where
[22:59] many young people have had an encounter
[23:01] with the Lord with many delivered healed
[23:04] revived filled with the Holy Ghost and
[23:06] others saved we actually had over seven
[23:08] Souls that accepted Jesus Christ as
[23:09] their personal savior surely we Are
[23:12] Witnesses of what the Lord did through
[23:13] the ministry of our precious Brothers
[23:15] Timothy Brother David in all the
[23:18] services who were our main speakers as
[23:21] well as our brother T and brother morgas
[23:22] who were our devotional speakers special
[23:26] thanks to you brother Tim PR and the
[23:28] assembly in Louisiana for sending
[23:30] brother Timothy our way his ministry is
[23:32] just one uh what that we needed at such
[23:36] a time as this over 450 young people
[23:39] came physically and many more streaming
[23:41] all over Africa have been beneficiary of
[23:44] these God ordained
[23:46] meetings thank you to the assembly in
[23:49] France for allowing your pastor our
[23:51] brother David for coming we have
[23:52] sincerely been enriched by this God
[23:55] called Ministry God bless you richly and
[23:57] and we are looking forward to another
[23:59] wonderful time come
[24:01] 2025 Shalom God bless you
[24:04] all amen Amen brother bus has um just
[24:09] found him to be a wonderful wonderful
[24:11] man of God and and uh he's
[24:15] um uh he's a little little different if
[24:18] I can say it that way than than what you
[24:20] may think of as uh Africans you know he
[24:23] don't we we me and me nor Brother David
[24:27] put one bit of our own money into this
[24:29] meeting but he had he had the faith to
[24:31] believe that if God called it and it was
[24:34] God ordained God would fulfill the needs
[24:37] and so uh it's it's public it's there
[24:40] online so I mean he got up before his
[24:42] own people and stood and said you know
[24:44] we are not Beggars we're that's not who
[24:47] we are we're Children of the most high
[24:49] God and if God can take care of those
[24:52] Brothers over there in other countries
[24:54] he can take care of us and Supply our
[24:56] needs and so so um they were facing a
[24:59] bit of a debt because as you can see
[25:01] this is a really nice campus that they
[25:04] had rented and this is actually the hall
[25:06] that we had made met in from this I
[25:08] think it's a side view of it but it's
[25:10] real beautiful little area there that we
[25:13] met and cost quite a bit of money but
[25:15] every they P pulled all of their
[25:17] resources pastors from all over sent
[25:20] money in from different places in Africa
[25:22] to support it and and God really blessed
[25:25] it and we're we're thankful for God
[25:27] called me that'll step out in faith and
[25:29] believe that if God can provide for
[25:31] others he can provide for us and he did
[25:34] that and so this is just some of the
[25:36] some of the scenery this is actually a
[25:39] picture from our hotel there um uh not
[25:43] all that you see is as pretty as it
[25:46] really or what it really looked like but
[25:49] this was it was incredible it was a
[25:51] beautiful little Garden area that um I
[25:54] forget the name of the um um the
[25:58] denominational system that actually owns
[26:01] this but they allowed them to rent it
[26:03] and as he said about 450 young people
[26:06] came and and the Lord just really moved
[26:09] and um in all of the areas um that right
[26:14] there I don't know if you can really see
[26:17] but that right there actually is the
[26:19] kitchen uh they cooked everything
[26:21] outside they they provided their own
[26:23] food they they uh provided U everything
[26:27] that U that they that they had and so um
[26:32] the food you know is it it it tasted
[26:35] good some of
[26:38] it uh brother bus would he would agree
[26:41] with me on that so uh but uh you know uh
[26:45] our our our stomachs are not their
[26:47] stomachs and so uh you have to watch
[26:49] yourself over there because um um just
[26:52] the way they keep their meats and
[26:54] different things is not uh the way we do
[26:56] and so yeah I got a little sick from it
[26:59] and uh and dealt with it as I got home
[27:01] thankfully it it waited till I got home
[27:04] before it really hit but um there's
[27:06] nothing like being sick on an
[27:09] airplane so that's U there
[27:15] go and they they they that's Believers
[27:18] cooking the food and they provided for
[27:20] 450 people and bought the food and done
[27:23] everything so but the bus is very
[27:25] organized in the way that he handles
[27:27] situations he he's got a church mainly
[27:30] of a lot of young people that he's
[27:31] witnessed to and brought into the
[27:33] message and and he allows them to be
[27:36] part and so he he makes them part of the
[27:38] team and and they all have their part to
[27:40] play and they all do it very well it was
[27:43] very well run and it was very well done
[27:45] so and this was a picture from the back
[27:48] as the meeting be to grow and of course
[27:50] we had the first service Friday night
[27:52] wasn't as many there on Friday night
[27:54] because they were still traveling in
[27:56] it's not easy you you know to travel you
[27:58] know uh just just for us to go to the
[28:01] hotel was only only about I think around
[28:04] 10 kilm which is maybe six miles or so
[28:08] but uh somewhere in there and and but it
[28:10] would take nearly an hour to get back
[28:12] and forth from our hotel to the to the
[28:15] meeting and so first night you know he I
[28:18] I don't know if I have the clip here but
[28:19] he had it play in there on his live
[28:21] stream and brother bus is um he's a a
[28:24] real
[28:25] enthusiastic man of God and he just
[28:28] singing and shouting on the way and
[28:29] we're going through potholes up and down
[28:31] and he's like no worry brother you're
[28:33] not late we're going to get there you
[28:34] know and so we got there and uh the Lord
[28:37] really moved and we're sure
[28:56] thankful
[29:00] yeah I'm not sure how this
[29:06] thing your enem looking to
[29:14] [Music]
[29:17] imposs another
[29:21] [Music]
[29:25] di but they came with the expectation
[29:28] you know uh it's a little different
[29:30] getting in a air conditioning car and
[29:32] taking a 30 minute ride I I it kind of
[29:35] blows my mind some people think that's a
[29:36] long ways to go to church some of these
[29:39] walk that far and uh would be there and
[29:42] they come with expectations to the the
[29:45] Lord would would meet them

[1:05:55] we serve a God who never
[1:05:58] fails we've seen him heal cancer not
[1:06:02] just once we've seen him do it numbers
[1:06:06] of time we've seen him he'll blame brain
[1:06:10] bleeds and give extension of Life we've
[1:06:13] seen him restore Health
[1:06:16] to where where a man wouldn't have to
[1:06:19] take oxygen for 3 years and extend his
[1:06:22] life you know we're not going to live
[1:06:24] here forever and God's got a
[1:06:27] predetermined destined time for us to
[1:06:30] leave because he's determined that these
[1:06:33] mortal bodies will not always be what
[1:06:36] we're
[1:06:37] in and until the change comes there will
[1:06:40] be those maybe even up to a day or so I
[1:06:44] don't know maybe hours before the change
[1:06:47] we may put them away in the grave but
[1:06:49] they're coming right back
[1:06:52] up you see
[1:06:54] the promise is
[1:06:56] ours the promise is ours today whether
[1:06:59] it's healing
[1:07:01] Deliverance whatever the need is even
[1:07:04] even yes even for your financial needs
[1:07:07] God
[1:07:08] cares he's he watches over the sparrow
[1:07:11] and he clothes the the flowers of the
[1:07:14] field and he said don't you know I know
[1:07:16] how to take care of you
[1:07:18] too so you can trust him for
[1:07:21] everything he's an everything God
[1:07:24] not just specializes in Hills and
[1:07:27] Valleys or you know or this problem or
[1:07:29] that but he
[1:07:31] specializes even in what men call
[1:07:35] impossible we're here today to go to the
[1:07:37] Lord in prayer I got a text from Brother
[1:07:40] Kenny Camp uh who uh asked me to pray
[1:07:44] this morning for sister Jeanie she was
[1:07:46] coming to church she went back to bed
[1:07:49] with a sick headache she'll go to she'll
[1:07:52] go to the hospital for surgery tomorrow
[1:07:55] as the cancer has shrunk where that um
[1:07:58] it can be operated on the the surgery
[1:08:01] scheduled at
[1:08:03] 9:30 her doctors have been absolutely
[1:08:06] amazed that she's had very little or no
[1:08:08] side effects but you see we believe Mark
[1:08:11] 16 around here that if we take any
[1:08:14] deadly thing it'll not hurt us so we
[1:08:16] believe that and we apply that we also
[1:08:20] have um someone who's written in I
[1:08:22] believe they're from West Virginia but
[1:08:25] anyway that's where the aric Cod is from
[1:08:27] it's Robbie
[1:08:29] Davis and um but he's been recently
[1:08:32] diagnosed with cancer and he's asked
[1:08:35] that we would pray for him he even asked
[1:08:39] that I would maybe call and pray for him
[1:08:41] but I've alerted him today that we are
[1:08:44] praying for him in this
[1:08:46] service and you know I'm I'm not asking
[1:08:50] you to pray because we're just hoping
[1:08:53] that somebody body here has Faith to
[1:08:55] believe and one of you you know might do
[1:08:58] it but I believe that we're all people
[1:09:00] of
[1:09:01] faith that we've been taught to believe
[1:09:04] the word of God to believe the word of
[1:09:06] promises and that God is not just more
[1:09:10] than able he's more than willing one man
[1:09:13] would ask him one time
[1:09:15] lord if thou will you can heal me of
[1:09:19] this
[1:09:20] leprosy he didn't have to think about it
[1:09:23] he said I will be thy clean you see it
[1:09:26] is God's will to bring healing that's
[1:09:29] why he
[1:09:30] died for our deliverance I'm speaking to
[1:09:34] you too sister Jennifer God bless you

[1:09:41] need a kidney transplant well I know a
[1:09:44] good
[1:09:46] physician I've seen him work as he does
[1:09:49] the best job and he is more than able
[1:09:53] we're going to look to the Lord today as
[1:09:56] we go to prayer and believe God for
[1:09:59] these needs for Robbie there in in West
[1:10:03] Virginia don't give up hope don't don't

[1:10:07] hopeless no we serve a living God for
[1:10:11] sister Jeanie there that is listening
[1:10:14] with her and brother Kenny together and
[1:10:16] facing surgery
[1:10:18] tomorrow w i remember I remember going
[1:10:22] into a hospital room and
[1:10:24] with sister Karen emmans before her
[1:10:26] surgery and they would go and she was
[1:10:30] all the tested said she had cancer in in
[1:10:34] her female glands they went in there
[1:10:38] after prayer and and you know the story
[1:10:41] I went in there brother Timothy just a
[1:10:43] young minister at that time he would
[1:10:45] preach on
[1:10:46] it I walked in there and I said what
[1:10:49] what do you want me to do with this
[1:10:52] cancer that was my question what do you
[1:10:54] want me to do about this how do you want
[1:10:57] me to pray she said cut his head
[1:11:01] off we had prayer with her that day they
[1:11:04] go in there the doctors are embarrassed
[1:11:06] come in there really embarrassed coming
[1:11:09] to the family said we don't know what
[1:11:12] happened we can't explain what happened
[1:11:14] but we we went in there and we didn't
[1:11:17] find
[1:11:20] anything that's the kind of God we
[1:11:22] serve
[1:11:24] amen now God would give her three more
[1:11:26] years of life and she needed that there
[1:11:28] was some things that she needed to get
[1:11:30] right with the Lord and and make peace
[1:11:33] with and she did that and God took her
[1:11:36] but you know that was her
[1:11:39] time but if Satan is standing before you
[1:11:42] today with the door of death you don't
[1:11:44] have to walk into it we have an
[1:11:48] intercessor and we can go to the judge
[1:11:51] and say we need a restraining order put
[1:11:53] on the devil amen that's called Divine
[1:11:56] Healing he's trying to take somebody
[1:11:58] they ain't made their three score and 10
[1:12:00] and even if they have it doesn't really
[1:12:02] matter I mean Abraham didn't get his his
[1:12:05] real blessings until he was after 100 so
[1:12:08] we can believe God for every
[1:12:12] need that's what we are we are
[1:12:15] believers that's what believers do they
[1:12:19] believe will you believe with me today

[1:13:08] through the man Christ Jesus who was God
[1:13:12] In the Flesh I pray dear father in the

[1:14:17] is true and that Satan is defeated and
[1:14:20] that he has to leave their bodies now in

[1:14:51] having one great outpour after
[1:14:54] outpouring of the Holy
[1:14:56] Spirit we are so thankful for that we're
[1:15:00] so grateful for what the Lord is doing
[1:15:02] and what the Lord has done and amen what
[1:15:06] he will do for he said I I'll be with
[1:15:09] you even in you to the end of the world

[1:15:23] so he is our comforter our strength our
[1:15:26] guide this morning and we're looking to
[1:15:28] him amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 14
[1:15:33] want to begin reading from this today
[1:15:36] I'm going to be speaking today on behold
[1:15:39] the word
[1:15:40] bride amen behold the word bride now
[1:15:45] Romans 8 verse 14 actually would be R
[1:15:50] the this chapter is probably one one of
[1:15:53] my all-time favorite chapters of the
[1:15:56] Bible for as many are as led by the
[1:15:59] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:16:02] how many believes he'll lead you and as
[1:16:05] I've often said it's not because we are
[1:16:08] you know put on cruise control and
[1:16:10] autopilot and we're just going to get
[1:16:12] there but if we're Sons we seek his
[1:16:15] leadership that proves our sunship we
[1:16:18] know who our father is for you have not
[1:16:21] received the spirit of bondage again of
[1:16:23] fear but you have received the spirit of
[1:16:26] adoption whereby we cry ABA father the
[1:16:30] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[1:16:32] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:16:35] and if children then Hees of God then
[1:16:37] heirs Hees of God and join HS with
[1:16:40] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:16:43] that we may be also glorified together
[1:16:45] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:16:48] present time are not worthy to be
[1:16:50] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:16:52] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:16:55] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:16:58] the
[1:16:59] manifestations of the sons of God Amen
[1:17:03] God bless you you can be
[1:17:05] seated amen I I tell you I we have such
[1:17:10] a wonderful word of God laying before us
[1:17:13] today and I I also wanted to mention
[1:17:16] that I I especially that I've so
[1:17:19] appreciated your prayers over this past
[1:17:23] um this past week and especially while I
[1:17:26] was in V Virginia course you didn't know
[1:17:29] that I was going it was to be a surprise
[1:17:32] for brother Ron and so I didn't make any
[1:17:34] kind of announcement that I was going to
[1:17:37] be going there but I'd been asked by
[1:17:39] Brother Andrew to go and as you know uh
[1:17:43] no sooner than I got there uh just just
[1:17:47] um as just
[1:17:49] within just after my arrival we um uh he
[1:17:53] got a phone call from the doctor telling
[1:17:56] him the news of of all of his um recent
[1:17:59] uh test um last night he he preached a
[1:18:04] masterpiece a wonderful service and and
[1:18:07] today they're going on down to um uh uh
[1:18:11] Florida and and from there we'll go on a
[1:18:14] little Cruise so they're having a little
[1:18:16] time of of RNR but anyway um this I went
[1:18:21] there and I had um had that time
[1:18:24] together with him I asked brother Donnie
[1:18:25] Reagan to come and to meet us there he
[1:18:28] also was really really gracious to put
[1:18:32] aside his busyness of his schedule and
[1:18:35] to come and we had a uh a tremendous
[1:18:39] time together and just you know a time
[1:18:42] of prayer and time of you know of the
[1:18:46] promises of God and and if you watched
[1:18:49] the service it was a very powerful and
[1:18:52] very mov Moving Service uh where that we
[1:18:55] have done what God what God's word told
[1:18:59] us to do and uh so we I believe have
[1:19:03] fully obeyed the Lord and it's um up to
[1:19:05] him amen we certainly want his will no
[1:19:09] matter what I want his will from my life
[1:19:13] no matter what amen and so sometimes we
[1:19:17] maybe don't maybe we don't understand
[1:19:20] God's will or his purpose or his plan
[1:19:23] but we know that we are in his hands and
[1:19:26] our lives are in his hands the other day
[1:19:28] I watched a an interview with an Israeli
[1:19:33] Israeli soldier as he was talking about
[1:19:37] um the events of the war that they are
[1:19:39] in and I mention this because I I
[1:19:43] believe that in many ways that we are um
[1:19:47] we parallel Israel they are the natural
[1:19:50] people we are the spiritual people
[1:19:53] and so even brother brandham told us he
[1:19:56] if if you want to know what time it is
[1:19:58] he said watch Israel see what's
[1:20:01] happening there and um you know we as I
[1:20:06] watched this interview he was telling
[1:20:09] how that Israel would never be the same
[1:20:12] as before October the 7th the day that
[1:20:15] they were attacked by the Hamas and um
[1:20:20] said the Army will not be the same said
[1:20:22] soet itself will not be the same and and
[1:20:26] of course uh many of our my brethren and
[1:20:29] myself included believe this is a
[1:20:32] precursor to the great battle of
[1:20:35] Armageddon that lays right ahead of us
[1:20:38] that we're that I wouldn't miss for the
[1:20:40] world now I'm going to go away but I'm
[1:20:42] going to come back for it right because
[1:20:45] there's a Rapture and a married supper
[1:20:48] of the lamb and the judgments being
[1:20:51] poured out upon the Earth
[1:20:53] and and then we will come back with him
[1:20:56] in Revelation
[1:20:57] 19 um following the the he that sits
[1:21:02] upon the White Horse the word of God and
[1:21:07] we will be following him coming back to
[1:21:09] take it over for the Millennium you can
[1:21:12] just look around the world today we're
[1:21:15] going to get it all back man it was
[1:21:17] stolen from him but we're going to get
[1:21:20] it all back but but this man was saying
[1:21:23] we have been living under the delusion
[1:21:26] that terrorists can be appeased and
[1:21:28] negotiated with and this has been a very
[1:21:31] strong wakeup call to the fact that you
[1:21:33] cannot negotiate with evil you cannot
[1:21:36] negotiate with someone who is saying my
[1:21:39] essential goal is destroy you and
[1:21:41] everything you believe in and if and and
[1:21:44] say if I give you something you will
[1:21:46] decide that's not your end goal and just
[1:21:49] remember uh we we fight an enemy and
[1:21:53] those same spirits that you saw
[1:21:55] physically attack Israel is against the
[1:21:58] bride in an
[1:22:00] ecclesiastical manner remember this it
[1:22:04] it comes against us in the
[1:22:06] ecclesiastical manner now we we had all
[1:22:09] that kind of uh convoluted some years
[1:22:12] ago and we thought the bride would go
[1:22:13] through all of that but you know that's
[1:22:16] that's not the promise the promise when
[1:22:19] the trumpets were um were placed for the
[1:22:22] prophet
[1:22:23] of God as like Joshua placing the people
[1:22:26] in the land and we were placed in the
[1:22:28] promises we were shown that uh again
[1:22:31] that the squeeze even that he talked
[1:22:33] about and and pondered over and and and
[1:22:36] thought well this will be perhaps when
[1:22:38] the third pull will work and and
[1:22:41] whatever he would come in the Feast of
[1:22:43] the trumpets after being revealed what
[1:22:46] portion was to Israel and that portion
[1:22:48] divided and said you know we don't go
[1:22:51] through that time and you know that he
[1:22:54] will keep us from his bride from
[1:22:57] everything that anything that would turn
[1:22:59] her hand and so he makes it clear the
[1:23:02] next thing for you is the
[1:23:04] rapture and we're in it we're a part of
[1:23:07] that
[1:23:08] Rapture and uh and but but again they
[1:23:11] come against us in an ecclesiastical
[1:23:14] manner in other words in a spiritual
[1:23:16] Manner and even using even using
[1:23:19] religion even we use quotes
[1:23:23] even and and it even can happen even
[1:23:25] from message pulpits or from from the
[1:23:29] pressures of of religion or whatever
[1:23:32] that that the very society that we're
[1:23:34] live in is is designed to kill your
[1:23:38] faith to destroy with you and you cannot
[1:23:43] negotiate with someone who's saying my
[1:23:45] essential goal is to destroy you and
[1:23:48] everything you believe in and say if
[1:23:51] I'll just give you something if I can to
[1:23:53] you know give you something I can
[1:23:54] appease you you know and you'll decide
[1:23:56] that's not your end goal and he said the
[1:23:58] Islamic has been stating openly for
[1:24:00] decades that is our goal the destruction
[1:24:03] of the Jewish people and everything they
[1:24:05] stand for and not just the Jewish people
[1:24:08] but everyone that everybody that
[1:24:10] believes like them the judeo-christian
[1:24:12] values Western values the concept of
[1:24:15] peace and Liberty they are opposed to
[1:24:17] all that of that they openly say again
[1:24:20] and again we want to destroy all this we
[1:24:22] want to take away your freedoms we want
[1:24:24] to take away your peace we want to take
[1:24:27] away your belief system we're going to
[1:24:30] kill you to do that and we have this
[1:24:33] Western mindset that maybe we can
[1:24:35] appease them maybe we can sort of keep
[1:24:37] it under control and this has been a
[1:24:40] very clear wakeup call for me personally
[1:24:43] for our country and for anyone who has
[1:24:46] eyes and ears to see and hear what is
[1:24:48] going on that there is a there is real
[1:24:51] good and there is a true evil evil so I
[1:24:54] and this I want you to keep the parallel
[1:24:56] this is really not what I'm preaching on
[1:24:58] this is just introducting an
[1:25:00] introduction this morning but Israel he
[1:25:03] says is a nation that says we are here
[1:25:06] by called to be here by God and the
[1:25:10] Nation of Islam that says we are called
[1:25:12] religiously to destroy you and and there
[1:25:17] is a force that is corrupted by e evil
[1:25:22] and hatred that opposes God's people and
[1:25:25] God's plan and I want you to say that is
[1:25:27] also true of the attack on the bride of
[1:25:30] Christ in this day because we are called
[1:25:35] here we have been brought here to this
[1:25:38] land of promise to the Bible Bible times
[1:25:43] Bible days to bible promises to to the
[1:25:47] word of God to his fullness and we and
[1:25:51] and yet the enemy is saying we are
[1:25:54] called to destroy you and and they are a
[1:25:58] force corrupted by evil and hatred it
[1:26:01] opposes God's people and God's plan so
[1:26:05] don't be surprised that you're under
[1:26:08] opposition that you're being opposed
[1:26:10] don't be S surprised that Satan will
[1:26:13] come right in and he'll bring diseases
[1:26:16] and afflictions and unbelief and doubt
[1:26:20] and and everything else make you look
[1:26:23] like a failure and that you are not in
[1:26:26] your Promised Land he'll do everything
[1:26:29] he can to bring destruction and dis and
[1:26:34] discouragement remember he's got to work
[1:26:37] there's there are spirits released in
[1:26:40] this day that has not even been before
[1:26:43] in other ages I I'm I'm quoting this
[1:26:46] from actually Revelation chapter 9 where
[1:26:49] he where there are
[1:26:51] 300,000 th000 that is 300 million demons
[1:26:55] that have been
[1:26:57] reserved that has been in that has been
[1:27:00] in the and held in the in the river
[1:27:03] Euphrates this is symbolic and and I
[1:27:06] could go into all the symbolism this
[1:27:08] morning we know it and I could go into
[1:27:10] it but I'm not but they've been held and
[1:27:14] released in this day against the bride
[1:27:18] and against
[1:27:19] Israel and they will also come against
[1:27:21] the remnant of the woman's seed which
[1:27:24] will be the leftovers from the bride who
[1:27:27] will go through the tribulation who will
[1:27:30] be exterminated there there's going to
[1:27:31] be such violence and such hatred and
[1:27:35] such such you know evil that is poured
[1:27:39] out that you cannot imagine I'm talking
[1:27:42] about you can see them with as it's
[1:27:45] witnessed Again by the slaughter of
[1:27:48] innocent Israeli civilians heartless
[1:27:52] demons put Israeli babies in
[1:27:57] ovens and baked them in front of their
[1:28:01] parents and then slaughter
[1:28:05] them cut open pregnant women yes raped
[1:28:10] them so many times until their pelvics
[1:28:14] was broke that's right yes killed
[1:28:18] parents before the children took
[1:28:20] children killed them before the parents
[1:28:23] and these
[1:28:25] demons they might have went dormant
[1:28:27] maybe you know look like you know they
[1:28:29] made an appeasement with them we'll let
[1:28:31] you little have this little piece of
[1:28:33] this of this land of promise you know
[1:28:36] you can have over here and call yourself
[1:28:38] Palestinians you can have your self rule
[1:28:40] you can do all of that but they didn't
[1:28:42] want that they wanted all of the
[1:28:45] promise they didn't they want to drive
[1:28:48] Israel all the way to the Sea they don't
[1:28:51] want an Israel that's and I tell you
[1:28:54] Satan does not want a
[1:28:58] bride amen you cannot appease him and
[1:29:01] you know they might these Devils these
[1:29:03] demons might have went dormant but they
[1:29:05] not but not really they went into hiding
[1:29:08] all of these years they have been
[1:29:09] building massive underground tunnels
[1:29:13] coming only up only to sin
[1:29:16] destruction and Satan that might have
[1:29:18] went under here and there and you hadn't
[1:29:20] seen him working here and there and
[1:29:22] wherever but brother he's showing his
[1:29:24] ugly head
[1:29:27] again and and this man goes on the sage
[1:29:30] from the top to bottom we need
[1:29:32] Supernatural wisdom we're dealing with
[1:29:34] something that is beyond the basis of
[1:29:36] war and conflict we're dealing with a
[1:29:39] supernatural hatred toward Israel that
[1:29:41] is executed by Islam that is um Hamas
[1:29:45] hasbalah and Iran and at the same time
[1:29:48] we're fighting a war that is of
[1:29:50] spiritual significance we must see the
[1:29:53] big
[1:29:54] picture and I and I I want you to see
[1:29:56] even see that the attack of Satan that
[1:30:00] will come against the Saints of God
[1:30:02] whether it be like I said with sickness
[1:30:04] or or whether it be with unbelief or
[1:30:08] depression or or even from the clergy
[1:30:11] because it's an ecclesiastical demon
[1:30:13] remember this I I I want you to know
[1:30:16] that the it is we must see the big
[1:30:20] picture of what's really going on Amen

[1:30:37] of conflict this level of violence this
[1:30:40] level of pain and hurt is going to be
[1:30:42] carried for a long time then he was

[1:31:29] country and I want to say the same thing
[1:31:31] yes we have a future for our kids This
[1:31:34] Is Our Land God gave us an open book we
[1:31:38] don't want to just focus on one part we

[1:31:46] can bring forth life is brought in the
[1:31:48] right

[1:31:55] said I say God gave us this land and we
[1:31:58] have lived in this land and this the
[1:32:01] promise was to have the land and to live
[1:32:04] in it and and there again that's our
[1:32:07] promise to have this land of the Bible
[1:32:09] and to live in
[1:32:11] it amen we're going to see it bring
[1:32:13] forth fruit we're going to plant faith
[1:32:16] and water it with the right
[1:32:17] atmosphere and we're going to see
[1:32:19] healings Miracles salvation
[1:32:22] Deliverance amen Revelation
[1:32:26] understanding come on we're going to
[1:32:28] have everything that the Bible we're
[1:32:31] going to have holy lives Sanctified
[1:32:33] lives forgiveness of sins Mercy Grace
[1:32:37] we're going to have everything that's in
[1:32:39] the promised land and all it requires is
[1:32:44] is is planting the word in that promise
[1:32:48] amen and watering it with Thanksgiving
[1:32:51] would you your Praises amen an expecting
[1:32:55] return and God will make the Barren
[1:32:58] Barren land Rejoice if there's barness
[1:33:02] in your life and in your family God is
[1:33:05] going to make that be
[1:33:07] fruitful and there is future for our
[1:33:10] young
[1:33:11] people amen there is Future and he says
[1:33:15] he says um but he said he said God gave
[1:33:19] us this land we have lived in this land
[1:33:21] and the promise was have the land and to
[1:33:24] live in it abundantly but no one said it
[1:33:27] was going to be easy that promise
[1:33:29] doesn't exist and no one said it's going
[1:33:32] to be without a
[1:33:34] fight this land has always been fought
[1:33:43] over it's always been fought over amen
[1:33:47] and he said so it has been fought for
[1:33:49] and that reality hasn't been changed and
[1:33:52] I want to say Paul faal fart as did
[1:33:55] irenius Martin columber Luther and
[1:33:58] brother
[1:33:59] brandham and we're right here to today
[1:34:02] fighting for it and he said and we every
[1:34:05] once in a while need a reminder that
[1:34:09] things that are valuable require pain
[1:34:12] and suffering to
[1:34:14] gain nobody no Miracle ever can can ever
[1:34:18] be performed without pain and suffering
[1:34:20] first
[1:34:22] come on amen amen you're you're going to
[1:34:26] get you you go through things God
[1:34:29] couldn't God now listen it's the devil
[1:34:31] doing it God God couldn't put sickness
[1:34:35] on you and then say oh well that's so I
[1:34:37] could be a Healer so I could express my
[1:34:40] attributes so I put that on you no God
[1:34:42] doesn't put that on you man by choice
[1:34:45] accepted this way of life and so we live
[1:34:49] here in Mortal bodies that SA Satan when
[1:34:52] he can't get to the word he can attack
[1:34:54] the the vessel that the word comes in so
[1:34:57] he attacks your body he can't destroy
[1:35:00] the word but he can destroy your body
[1:35:03] right so so he says he said we need to
[1:35:07] reminder that the things that are
[1:35:09] valuable require pain and suffering to
[1:35:13] gain you go back to Jesus on the cross
[1:35:16] nothing happens without sacrifice and
[1:35:18] pain the same goes with this land
[1:35:20] history says you're going to suffer we
[1:35:24] are strong people that God has that has
[1:35:28] a god that is omnipotent all powerful
[1:35:32] all knowing and is in control our
[1:35:35] Sovereign God always has been he is
[1:35:39] Sovereign and he's always has been we
[1:35:41] have nothing to fear pain is fleeting
[1:35:45] and sacrifice for this land and to hold
[1:35:47] on to this land um is required and and
[1:35:51] the reality is that no one grows and no
[1:35:55] one transforms as an individual as a
[1:35:58] people without pain and fear right now
[1:36:01] we have a lot of pain and a whole lot of
[1:36:04] fear and it's time for God to
[1:36:09] work that's the way I feel this morning
[1:36:12] right now there's a lot of uncertainty
[1:36:15] in this world Lord right now there's a
[1:36:18] lot of pain Lord there's still suffering
[1:36:21] going on in every hand but it's time for
[1:36:24] God to
[1:36:26] work that's what I preached at brother
[1:36:28] Ron in case you'd want to know I
[1:36:30] preached on the hour has come because we
[1:36:34] are here in the in the appointed hour
[1:36:37] where God is time for God to work now
[1:36:42] rising up at this time is a word born
[1:36:45] bride as brother brandham told us as the
[1:36:48] end time prophecies will repeat I
[1:36:51] believe as a forerunner came from the
[1:36:53] Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of
[1:36:55] God the second Forerunner will probably
[1:36:58] do the same by pointing the people to a
[1:37:01] word born bride this is what that he
[1:37:05] said that we would be pointing to that
[1:37:08] he would be
[1:37:09] forerunning the the a a a bride that
[1:37:13] would be born of this word would
[1:37:16] actually be created by this word when
[1:37:19] there was no bride God sent a message a
[1:37:23] word to create one amen now and of
[1:37:27] course as if she's going to be a word
[1:37:29] born bride then as I preached before I
[1:37:33] left she'll be adopted and placed and
[1:37:36] and position in the promised land of the
[1:37:40] Bible as I have preached now for some
[1:37:44] some years the people of the book has
[1:37:47] returned to the land of the book we Are
[1:37:50] the People people of the book now and of
[1:37:54] course we again God's bringing forth
[1:37:58] adopted Sons now again forget about the
[1:38:02] idea of adopting a baby this is not the
[1:38:05] term the way the term is used it it
[1:38:08] means to take a man who is mature and
[1:38:11] put him in position as heir of all
[1:38:14] things so it was the ancient law that
[1:38:18] Paul is using of the of the Romans way
[1:38:20] of adop option of placing someone and
[1:38:24] you know in this case God is placing his
[1:38:26] own children Sons mature Sons into
[1:38:32] position into places of authority now
[1:38:36] and of course there the idea comes up
[1:38:40] you know well somehow or another we um
[1:38:43] we we're we're going to get um um we're
[1:38:47] going to get someday get adopted and and
[1:38:51] and one day is going to happen let me
[1:38:53] just tell you there was not one example
[1:38:55] in the New Testament of Peter James and
[1:38:58] John or Paul being filled with the
[1:39:01] spirit and then adopted not one example
[1:39:04] so you'd have to have Bible pattern for
[1:39:06] that and there is none no when they were
[1:39:09] filled with the spirit they were placed
[1:39:11] in the body with power and authority
[1:39:15] amen you shall receive power after the
[1:39:18] Holy Ghost has come upon you so yes
[1:39:22] brother bradam did use that and said you
[1:39:25] who have been born again and spoke of of
[1:39:29] the Pentecostals the Baptist the
[1:39:31] Methodist and all of them you he said
[1:39:35] that birth is not your placing he was
[1:39:38] pointing to something greater coming
[1:39:40] which was the coming of the token life
[1:39:43] the personal life of Jesus Christ which
[1:39:46] would bring a people into a place of
[1:39:50] authority where they would be the word
[1:39:52] bride a word
[1:39:55] church now if I can get time to get into
[1:39:58] it this morning we're going to
[1:40:00] understand what a word church is all
[1:40:03] right because there's a a
[1:40:05] misunderstanding about that but brother
[1:40:07] bam talks about this in the message
[1:40:09] Masterpiece and he he tells us his old
[1:40:13] sermon goes back to Christ being the
[1:40:17] Masterpiece being built up from the four
[1:40:20] corners of the foundation of of Abraham
[1:40:23] and Grace and Isaac of love and Jacob of
[1:40:27] of um well faith and and then gra and
[1:40:32] faith and then God's grace and then upon
[1:40:36] there the the love of God and then
[1:40:38] coming right down to Perfection to
[1:40:41] Joseph and he says you know it was built
[1:40:44] on that Perfection cuz it was aiming
[1:40:48] toward a Capstone so everything that
[1:40:50] would be built on God's Masterpiece
[1:40:53] would be pointing to the head and the
[1:40:56] head then would come which would there
[1:40:58] would then be the unveiling of what God
[1:41:01] had been doing through the Jewish ages
[1:41:05] are you with me now so again for nearly
[1:41:09] 2,000 years he said that God had been or
[1:41:13] uh now has God had been making a
[1:41:16] masterpiece and and again he just as he
[1:41:19] struck a part of off of Adam here he was
[1:41:23] God's Masterpiece but he struck a part
[1:41:25] out of him to make Eve and and he said a
[1:41:29] part of him to make a wife for him and
[1:41:31] he said now that per perfect Masterpiece
[1:41:34] he struck him at Calvary here he brought
[1:41:37] him up and he struck him and a piece
[1:41:39] come off of him and he said it's just a
[1:41:42] new testament that's all he said he
[1:41:44] fulfilled the Old Testament now the New
[1:41:47] Testament is another piece to be
[1:41:49] fulfilled see the new and old is husband
[1:41:54] and wife it taking the old to foreshadow
[1:41:57] the new Christ come the Masterpiece to
[1:42:00] fulfill that now his bride will fulfill
[1:42:05] everything that's in the New Testament
[1:42:08] another Masterpiece is in the making so
[1:42:11] here here we have it his bride will
[1:42:15] fulfill everything just as Jesus
[1:42:18] fulfilled the Psalms and would fill
[1:42:21] fulfilled the wisdom of Solomon and uh
[1:42:24] you know the prophets and their
[1:42:26] prophecies and the law of Moses here
[1:42:29] Jesus was the embodiment of all of that
[1:42:32] so the fullness of the godhead would be
[1:42:36] in Bride form what he has been doing
[1:42:39] Through the Ages the justification of
[1:42:41] Luther the sanctification of Wesley the
[1:42:44] the gifts of the Spirit of of ausa
[1:42:46] Street and now right into the end where
[1:42:49] that we come back to the original the
[1:42:53] original wheat that was planted now of
[1:42:56] course
[1:42:58] Satan has used his Venom to tear us down
[1:43:02] to try to discourage us he's attacking
[1:43:05] us with sickness with diseases and
[1:43:09] trouble but I want to to say again we
[1:43:11] will not leave this
[1:43:14] land although they threatened us to
[1:43:17] annihilate us from the river to the sea
[1:43:20] but now and since Satan cannot overcome
[1:43:23] the spirit of the Lord it will try to
[1:43:26] destroy the vessel and who the spirit of
[1:43:28] Truth dwells listen to what brother Bram
[1:43:31] said in the Ephesian Church age no
[1:43:34] matter how just and upright a Christian
[1:43:36] is before the public and how gracious he
[1:43:40] is to his fellow man doing not but good
[1:43:43] let him confess Christ as his Savior and
[1:43:47] acknowledge the operation of the gifts
[1:43:49] of the Spirit in tongues prophecy
[1:43:52] healing and miracles and he will be
[1:43:54] condemned the spirit of this world hates
[1:43:58] the spirit of God and because it can't
[1:44:00] overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries
[1:44:03] to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit
[1:44:06] of Truth
[1:44:07] dwells so you're under
[1:44:10] attack he can't get to the word he can't
[1:44:13] stop the
[1:44:14] word so he comes against he comes
[1:44:18] against the men of God he comes against
[1:44:20] the women of God he comes against the
[1:44:22] whole Church of God he he's against
[1:44:25] you and he's bringing you got to
[1:44:28] recognize when when and get your Shield
[1:44:31] of Faith up come on you got to recognize
[1:44:34] when the fiery darts of the Devil comes
[1:44:37] when doubt and unbelief comes and
[1:44:40] depression and fear and worry and all
[1:44:44] these other things you you got to
[1:44:45] realize you got a real
[1:44:47] enemy and you got to hold your Shield of
[1:44:50] faith up and ward off the fiery darts of
[1:44:52] the
[1:44:53] wicked but it's time church that we
[1:44:57] realize it's more than just stay in
[1:45:00] defense Israel had done that over and
[1:45:03] over again you know they had their Iron
[1:45:05] Dome they had their Shield up we can
[1:45:07] knock down your missiles where they can
[1:45:09] reach our people and they were
[1:45:11] comfortable about they built their fence
[1:45:13] and we've got a uh you know fence that
[1:45:15] between us and you and and and we we put
[1:45:18] millions and millions of dollars in it
[1:45:21] and we we and they went to sleep under
[1:45:24] that that umbrella of
[1:45:27] safety and the enemy comes
[1:45:32] in because they were
[1:45:35] asleep we cannot sleep in this
[1:45:38] hour we got to be
[1:45:42] vigilant amen because our enemy The
[1:45:45] Devil he's going about he's not a
[1:45:47] roaring lion but he goes like a roaring
[1:45:49] lion he com screaming and
[1:45:52] Howling amen the real lion is the tribe
[1:45:55] of Judah he's an
[1:45:57] impersonator he's a liar and a
[1:45:59] thief is that right he comes in to as a
[1:46:03] thief to Rob and to kill and
[1:46:06] destroy amen so now I just want to say
[1:46:10] again and make you realize you are under
[1:46:14] attack you're going to be under attack
[1:46:18] and he's going to come every way he can
[1:46:19] but it's time
[1:46:20] that we take the war to the enemy yes
[1:46:25] and that's what I've been doing you know
[1:46:27] I'll tell you what I mean I it I tell
[1:46:30] you what it really accelerated when he
[1:46:32] attacked sister
[1:46:34] Atlanta man I determined I'm going to
[1:46:36] preach Faith ever service I'm going to
[1:46:38] pound that enemy I'm going to be like a
[1:46:40] hammer and I'm going to hammer till he
[1:46:42] SM to Pieces we're going to stand on the
[1:46:45] promise and we're going to see
[1:46:49] victory amen you
[1:46:52] see that that was that was more more of
[1:46:55] a wakeup call to realize he we got a God
[1:46:59] in our midst and he's
[1:47:03] omnipotent let's unleash his power let's
[1:47:06] learn how to throw the bombs of prayer
[1:47:08] that are more powerful than an atomic
[1:47:11] bomb let's learn how to fight
[1:47:14] back to resist the
[1:47:17] enemy hallelujah it's when you resist
[1:47:21] him he flees from
[1:47:25] you now through the prophet messenger
[1:47:28] and then dwell in spirit we have been
[1:47:29] restored back to being the
[1:47:32] word I want you to get this we are the
[1:47:35] word yes we are the
[1:47:39] message amen we are the word made flesh
[1:47:44] therefore the very works of Christ is
[1:47:46] being produced again in the body oh then
[1:47:50] what day for sons of God to rise on the
[1:47:53] scene amen it's been prophesied
[1:47:56] therefore predestined for this age in
[1:47:58] this time and here we are to fulfill the
[1:48:02] New
[1:48:03] Testament 2,000 years he' been building
[1:48:06] the Masterpiece but he's about to take
[1:48:10] that piece that was smitten from him at
[1:48:12] Calvary and bring it back to his side
[1:48:14] and there'll be a Rapture in a going
[1:48:18] home so that's why I say said behold
[1:48:21] look the Lamb's the bride the Lamb's
[1:48:23] wife I want to say it again behold the
[1:48:26] word bride she's the
[1:48:30] word we we are the bride because the
[1:48:33] word and the spirit has come in his
[1:48:36] fullness therefore because of its
[1:48:39] fullness we are a mature age this thus
[1:48:43] this is the bride
[1:48:46] age this is the word age the token Age
[1:48:49] The Eagle age the weed age we could go
[1:48:51] on and on the you know it's the fourth
[1:48:55] light therefore it brings forth the
[1:48:58] grain now that might be that you might
[1:49:02] say huh a forth light well the light you
[1:49:05] know Shone through darkness and the haze
[1:49:07] of Catholicism to show Luther enough
[1:49:11] light for
[1:49:12] justification amen the light grew in
[1:49:15] intensity through Wesley and uh until it
[1:49:18] came to sanctification
[1:49:20] and then it would grow in brilliance
[1:49:23] through the isua movement let me stop
[1:49:27] for a minute and and and help you in
[1:49:29] your thinking if you would plant the
[1:49:32] wheat seed in the in the strength of the
[1:49:36] light of the summer and that little
[1:49:38] green blade come out what would happen
[1:49:40] to it it would die it would wither and
[1:49:42] die Sun's too strong for
[1:49:45] it right but there is a time where the
[1:49:49] weat will need need that light but not
[1:49:52] in the blade so actually in our part of
[1:49:55] the country is planted in you know
[1:49:57] usually as winter wheat and it'll it'll
[1:50:00] it'll grow and and the light the length
[1:50:02] of days and the the the heat of the Sun
[1:50:05] and you know it's a lot of cloudy days
[1:50:07] and rain and here comes that little
[1:50:09] blade up and then as the sun gets
[1:50:13] strengthened and and the days get longer
[1:50:16] what happens to the wheat it
[1:50:18] grows and it moves from the stage of the
[1:50:21] blade into the
[1:50:23] tsel and the
[1:50:26] pollen amen and then then then again
[1:50:30] again comes up and then there it heads
[1:50:32] up into where there's a sh that was a
[1:50:34] Zeus's tree but then finally as we call
[1:50:38] it the fourth light or the light for the
[1:50:40] four stades of wheat amen it it comes in
[1:50:43] its full
[1:50:48] strength this is this is why in
[1:50:52] Revelation 10 his face is as it were the
[1:50:55] sun his coming in this day is with an
[1:50:58] unveiled face and his face is as it were
[1:51:02] the sun it's in the fullness of the word
[1:51:05] in the full power and the full strength
[1:51:07] to do what now that light full light
[1:51:11] would have killed the blade it wouldn't
[1:51:13] have been good for the tussle it
[1:51:16] wouldn't have worked for the sh but for
[1:51:18] you it brings the church back to be the
[1:51:22] original grain ripened exactly like it
[1:51:26] was when it was planted on the day of
[1:51:30] [Applause]
[1:51:32] Pentecost so now the light has shown to
[1:51:36] the Hast but at the evening time so
[1:51:40] there will be a day it'll be a time
[1:51:42] there won it won't be like day night you
[1:51:44] know you know cloudy days and hazy and
[1:51:47] you don't see clearly and you know some
[1:51:49] will look look and and still seeing God
[1:51:52] as three people and I and a and a and a
[1:51:56] false baptism and all kinds of false
[1:51:59] ideas why the light wasn't
[1:52:02] there come on Amen but in the evening
[1:52:07] time this is what the Bible said it
[1:52:09] shall be
[1:52:11] light hence the name evening light
[1:52:14] Tabernacle because we're to be the
[1:52:16] Tabernacle of the evening light the
[1:52:19] church to the evening
[1:52:21] light come on Amen we're not the Church
[1:52:24] of Lutheran are we be called Lutheran
[1:52:26] we're not the Church of westl or we be
[1:52:28] called methodists after his methods
[1:52:30] we're not the Church of isusa street we
[1:52:33] are the evening
[1:52:37] light now of course I don't mean every
[1:52:39] Church everywhere has to be named
[1:52:41] evening light but that's why I named it
[1:52:43] evening
[1:52:44] light you know the evening light is
[1:52:48] because it's the Harvest Time what is
[1:52:52] needed to bring the wheat to maturity we
[1:52:55] are the bride because it's the fourth
[1:52:58] stage of
[1:52:59] restoration now there's not four stages
[1:53:01] to the birth don't get that confused
[1:53:04] there are four stages of restoration God
[1:53:06] would restore the church in four stages
[1:53:09] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:53:11] the Holy Ghost into gifts and then
[1:53:14] finally his fullness so which is token
[1:53:17] life so we we we are the bride because
[1:53:21] it is the fourth stage of restoration
[1:53:23] the wheat grain age exactly the church
[1:53:27] that was planted in the beginning
[1:53:30] manifested in the same form it was back
[1:53:34] there now as brother brandham said in
[1:53:37] the EP in the church ages he said when
[1:53:40] Jesus was born upon the Earth he said
[1:53:43] believest thou not that I'm in the
[1:53:45] father and the father in me the words
[1:53:48] that I speak unto you I speak speak not
[1:53:50] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[1:53:53] in me he doeth the work John 14:10 here
[1:53:56] it is most evidently set forth that the
[1:53:59] perfect manifestation of God in the sun
[1:54:01] was by the indwelling spirit
[1:54:04] manifesting in word and works that's
[1:54:08] exactly what we've been teaching all
[1:54:10] along when the bride will get back to
[1:54:13] being a word bride she will produce the
[1:54:17] very works that Jesus produced
[1:54:22] now you can see the expectation as Jesus
[1:54:25] showed the the indwelling spirit
[1:54:28] manifesting in work word and
[1:54:32] works help me preach now word and works
[1:54:37] when the bride gets back to be in a word
[1:54:40] bride she will produce the very works
[1:54:43] that Jesus
[1:54:48] produced
[1:54:50] now it's the hour where the Holy Ghost
[1:54:52] comes in fullness as it was at
[1:54:56] Pentecost the token of today is the Holy
[1:55:00] Ghost it is not just an isua anointing
[1:55:04] or mere baptism upon the flesh nor a
[1:55:07] baptism upon the spirit on the human
[1:55:10] Spirit but it is the literal Life of
[1:55:13] Christ returning back to live and dwell
[1:55:15] in The Believer and that's exactly what
[1:55:17] they received in Acts 2
[1:55:21] yeah they had emotion yes they had
[1:55:23] shouting yes they had speaking in
[1:55:24] tongues but what came was not tongues or
[1:55:27] motion or jumping or running or shouting
[1:55:30] what came was him that caused them to
[1:55:33] speak a Heavenly language amen and jump
[1:55:36] and shout and rejoice because of what
[1:55:38] they
[1:55:41] received I don't know why that's so hard
[1:55:43] for people to
[1:55:45] understand they get upset because
[1:55:47] somebody jumps and shouts well I'm I
[1:55:49] mean we receive something that's
[1:55:56] why
[1:55:58] amen well I mean some people jump and
[1:56:01] shout when they just get Sanctified well
[1:56:03] praise God if I had cigarettes taken
[1:56:04] away from me I jump and Shout about that
[1:56:06] too wouldn't
[1:56:07] [Applause]
[1:56:12] you now in the message token brother
[1:56:15] Bram tells
[1:56:16] us that God is requiring a token that
[1:56:19] you yourself has received the token the
[1:56:22] Holy Ghost it's the only way and the
[1:56:24] only sign that God will ever pass
[1:56:27] because it is a literal life of Jesus
[1:56:31] Christ return back to the
[1:56:35] believer so there it is the literal life
[1:56:38] of Jesus Christ returned back to the
[1:56:42] believer that's what the token is amen
[1:56:46] it's not a justification it's not just a
[1:56:49] sanctification although it does sanctify
[1:56:52] and justify and and causes you to Bubble
[1:56:56] over into Heavenly
[1:56:57] language amen it can do all of that but
[1:57:01] whatever it's the literal life of Jesus
[1:57:04] Christ return back to the believer this
[1:57:06] this is the token age brother Brandon
[1:57:09] would talk about this and he called it
[1:57:11] um in in um how can I overcome this is
[1:57:14] the age of the personal life of Christ
[1:57:19] you see where the chemical of his body
[1:57:22] what was in him now is made manifest in
[1:57:25] other words the Justified life
[1:57:26] Sanctified life all what they've had in
[1:57:29] the past it's God building his Great
[1:57:31] Masterpiece are you with me so he he
[1:57:34] tells us again that that we've had the
[1:57:36] water age the blood age but now is the
[1:57:39] token age of the Holy Ghost now again I
[1:57:43] I want to emphasize this is not like the
[1:57:46] zza baptism at all who still needed did
[1:57:49] the adoption and be placed as Sons The
[1:57:52] Token is the adoption and it places and
[1:57:56] positions us his son and anyone who has
[1:58:00] received the token has received the
[1:58:03] adoption robe of the spirit the Ring of
[1:58:06] identification and Authority on their
[1:58:09] finger and place into the kingdom to do
[1:58:12] the father's
[1:58:13] business amen now he calls it again in a
[1:58:18] message he said we have re received the
[1:58:21] supernatural Supreme
[1:58:24] token and so
[1:58:26] Supreme is the highest
[1:58:31] ranking a you know and a token is a sign
[1:58:34] so the highest ranking sign we have been
[1:58:37] given a supernatural Supreme highest
[1:58:41] ranking sign the literal life of Jesus
[1:58:48] Christ
[1:58:50] praise
[1:58:51] God now all that was that foreshadowed
[1:58:56] has been given to this
[1:58:58] generation this is what you got to
[1:59:00] understand all that was foreshadowed has
[1:59:02] been given to it other ages received
[1:59:05] other
[1:59:06] signs the Old Testament their sign of
[1:59:09] acceptance was the blood of an innocent
[1:59:11] lamb won't work
[1:59:13] today not that woolly
[1:59:15] lamb right and by the death of that lamb
[1:59:18] and by PL its blood they were accepted
[1:59:21] but it won't work today other ages for
[1:59:24] foreshadowed our age to be justified by
[1:59:27] faith and believing on the Lord Jesus
[1:59:29] Christ you see that was a sign of
[1:59:32] Acceptance in Luther's
[1:59:34] day and then Wesley received a greater
[1:59:37] sign that was of
[1:59:40] sanctification and and and he he
[1:59:43] ascended in the spirit there was more
[1:59:46] poured out and they were shouted and
[1:59:49] were slain in the spirit and but more
[1:59:52] importantly they were cleansed and had
[1:59:55] works of
[1:59:57] righteousness amen then more of the
[2:00:00] spirit was poured out in isusa street
[2:00:03] now Joel says in the last days did you
[2:00:07] ever notice that not last day last days
[2:00:11] brother Bram says 2,000 years he would
[2:00:14] pour out his spirit so this has been God
[2:00:17] pouring out his spirit through down to
[2:00:20] the ages now to this time where as I
[2:00:23] said he he empties or pours out his
[2:00:26] fullness into a bride people to make
[2:00:29] them a word
[2:00:32] bride now so again more the spirit was
[2:00:37] poured out of the zeusa street and they
[2:00:39] were not only justified by faith
[2:00:41] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ they
[2:00:43] had works of righteousness as also being
[2:00:47] Sanctified and and and they were as God
[2:00:50] raised them higher than Luther and
[2:00:52] Methodist their language got Quicken to
[2:00:54] a Heavenly language as gifts of the
[2:00:57] Spirit were poured out and that baptism
[2:01:00] was a sign to them that they were
[2:01:03] accepted amen but we have risen higher
[2:01:08] you see this is we are
[2:01:12] ascending come on as Satan's falling we
[2:01:15] are
[2:01:16] ascending amen you say well I believed
[2:01:19] on the Lord Brother Tim and I'm
[2:01:21] justified by faith well congratulations
[2:01:24] praise God for that you're on par with
[2:01:26] the
[2:01:29] lutherans and with the Baptist you've
[2:01:32] got that
[2:01:33] far I sitting the M the church that's as
[2:01:36] far as you got you're still a Baptist
[2:01:38] you're still a Lutheran sorry don't want
[2:01:41] to bust your bubble but you're not bride
[2:01:44] till you get the
[2:01:47] token amen
[2:01:49] you you you potentially maybe but you're
[2:01:53] not there yet and you certainly aren't
[2:01:55] adopted and
[2:01:57] placed are you with me now so you say
[2:02:01] well but but really brother Tim I
[2:02:05] believe the message
[2:02:08] yeah that was a good sign for Luther but
[2:02:10] you got to rise higher than that
[2:02:12] today cuz when brother brandham said you
[2:02:15] say I believe the message brother
[2:02:17] brandham he said yes but you must have
[2:02:19] the
[2:02:22] token you say well I I quit drinking man
[2:02:27] God took that from me like that and he
[2:02:29] cleansed me from alcohol and tobacco and
[2:02:32] drugs or you can say I'm a lady used to
[2:02:34] cut my hair wear shorts and paint my
[2:02:37] face well praise God you're just a good
[2:02:40] oldfashioned
[2:02:47] Methodist
[2:02:50] now don't don't throw rotten eggs at me
[2:02:53] I'm not in the mood for running I I'll
[2:02:55] face right up to
[2:02:59] it and you say well I've spoken tongues
[2:03:01] and I have gifts of the Spirit and I
[2:03:03] shout and dance in the aisle well that's
[2:03:04] a good sign and you've just come as far
[2:03:07] as is of
[2:03:09] Pentecostals but you must come further
[2:03:12] than that you must have his life within
[2:03:17] the soul and that's the word in its
[2:03:21] fullness and I'm not talking about a
[2:03:23] Doctrine I'm talking about the
[2:03:27] life so now we have the Holy Ghost is
[2:03:30] our token is our identification that
[2:03:32] we've accepted the death of the lamb now
[2:03:34] Not only was Jesus just a human life to
[2:03:37] come back on it but it was God himself
[2:03:39] manifest in flesh that brought back upon
[2:03:42] us the adoption of sons now that now we
[2:03:46] are the sons and daughters of God that
[2:03:48] is the the token is our identification
[2:03:51] that we have believed God and God has
[2:03:53] accepted so the token is the adoption
[2:03:57] that is why this adoption message are
[2:04:00] the cap are is the Capstone for the
[2:04:03] believer and this is this makes the
[2:04:05] believer
[2:04:07] Messiahs filled with the Billow fire
[2:04:10] putting them and placing them in the
[2:04:13] service this did not happen under this
[2:04:16] isusa Street Revival yeah they manif
[2:04:18] ested gifts under the anointing of the
[2:04:20] spirit but this is the token age where
[2:04:24] the life and the power of Christ must be
[2:04:28] on
[2:04:30] display now brother bradam talks about
[2:04:34] some of this in gowake Jesus he said
[2:04:36] they should have known them disciples he
[2:04:38] was a messiah the word Messiah means the
[2:04:41] anointed one he he had God he had all of
[2:04:46] God in him God was in him he said I
[2:04:48] Jesus's son I said I can do nothing in
[2:04:51] myself but what I see the father doth
[2:04:53] the father dwelleth in me he was the
[2:04:56] Messiah by that with that anointing made
[2:04:59] him fully Messiah and we with the same
[2:05:02] spirit that was upon him not in portion
[2:05:06] but the same quality with a portion upon
[2:05:09] us would make us like Messiahs would be
[2:05:13] little sons of God adopted sons of God
[2:05:18] and Holy Spirit has sealed us into his
[2:05:20] body and we are his
[2:05:23] children there should be nothing bother
[2:05:26] us nothing worry us we're
[2:05:30] his amen once you're sealed in there the
[2:05:35] devil cannot pull you
[2:05:37] away come on amen he said well if that's
[2:05:41] if it ain't he said we're false accuser
[2:05:43] we've been testifying of things that
[2:05:44] ain't so and I believe it I believe that
[2:05:46] now we're the sons of God not we will
[2:05:48] will be but right now and now we're
[2:05:50] seated together in Heavenly places in
[2:05:53] Jesus that's our position we have been
[2:05:55] positioned in a Heavenly
[2:05:59] place somebody with me now as we we
[2:06:03] think of this he said now I I'm going to
[2:06:05] give that position it's going to be
[2:06:08] given to someone there's somebody
[2:06:10] predestined to sit on my right hand and
[2:06:13] on my
[2:06:15] left they're going to sit with me in the
[2:06:18] throne
[2:06:19] they're going to have that same token
[2:06:21] life and be in Heavenly places
[2:06:25] positioned in Christ with every devil
[2:06:28] underneath their
[2:06:31] feet now there'll be people there has to
[2:06:35] be a people who are the word
[2:06:40] bride who are one with the word who do
[2:06:44] you say this is brother bradam said I
[2:06:45] wondered this great thing this
[2:06:47] ecumenical C we got in the world today
[2:06:49] World Council of churches forming
[2:06:52] together to make us all one I wanted
[2:06:54] they realize it that's exactly what the
[2:06:56] scriptures said they would do but they
[2:06:57] think it's the most wonderful thing in
[2:06:59] the world that all of us can join hands
[2:07:01] and be one that Jesus prayed that we
[2:07:03] might be one they said that's true but
[2:07:06] not that kind of one you see that's
[2:07:08] Babylon that's a forc religion let all
[2:07:11] just all come together and come under
[2:07:13] one headship this is what Satan is doing
[2:07:16] this day with the E communal move but he
[2:07:18] said be one as I and the father are one
[2:07:21] yeah be that kind of one then how will
[2:07:23] that be the word in us would be the
[2:07:25] anointed word that's the Oneness of God
[2:07:27] see the Oneness of God is the word
[2:07:30] anointed in you and then you become a
[2:07:33] son a messiah of the
[2:07:37] age so you have been brought into
[2:07:40] Oneness with God not the E communal kind
[2:07:44] that brings everybody together under one
[2:07:46] headship but coming under the headship
[2:07:48] of Christ one with him how by the
[2:07:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost you are
[2:07:53] birthed into the body and the body is
[2:07:58] him my hands my feet my eyes it's all
[2:08:02] me the body is
[2:08:06] him Hallelujah and when you're baptized
[2:08:09] in that body when you're part of that
[2:08:12] church you are
[2:08:16] him come on
[2:08:19] now he uses Moses he said Moses was the
[2:08:23] anointed word that was promised for that
[2:08:27] day amen that's what Moses was Abraham
[2:08:30] had prophesied that he would come said
[2:08:33] for you know for 400 years you'll so
[2:08:35] journey in a Strange Land and after that
[2:08:37] I'll bring you out with a mighty hand
[2:08:40] Moses would be that Mighty hand he was
[2:08:43] prophesied many years 400 years before
[2:08:46] and here he was you know there he was
[2:08:49] now come became the anointed word for
[2:08:53] the AIDS that prophecy
[2:08:58] anointed don't let this go over your
[2:09:00] head you are the word the New Testament
[2:09:06] anointed amen the great sh kind of Glory
[2:09:09] was all around him every move he made
[2:09:11] represented God and he said that's where
[2:09:14] the church ought to be standing
[2:09:17] now again and as he continues on he said
[2:09:20] them them prophets you know there he
[2:09:24] said you know they would obey what God's
[2:09:26] word said and led by the spirit and he
[2:09:29] said give me a church that's so Anointed
[2:09:32] with god Till There ever move in action
[2:09:35] is dust sayith the Lord and walk in
[2:09:37] action kind of glory and I'll show you a
[2:09:40] messiah an anointed one of God standing
[2:09:43] on the earth and I want to declare today
[2:09:46] there is an anointed Messiah
[2:09:50] it's the Bride of Jesus Christ and she's
[2:09:53] standing on the
[2:09:58] earth now there stood Moses by his
[2:10:00] burning bush and the kind of glory and
[2:10:03] he and he he he didn't he was just
[2:10:07] obeying what God Said to do stick your
[2:10:09] hand in your bosom bring it out amen
[2:10:12] stick it back in and be healed what is a
[2:10:16] Divine
[2:10:17] Healing is that right amen and and so
[2:10:21] you know here again he was shown he
[2:10:23] would bind the
[2:10:25] serpent who who who was in the the
[2:10:28] people of the vision where the serpent
[2:10:31] is to be bound in this last day you're
[2:10:33] in that
[2:10:35] Vision amen there is a people on Earth
[2:10:37] today who will bind the devil who will
[2:10:40] bind death itself who will call for the
[2:10:43] resurrection and the dead in Christ
[2:10:47] arise
[2:10:50] this is where we're at this is the hour
[2:10:52] for it the hour has
[2:10:55] come now you
[2:10:58] see again said you know he said God took
[2:11:02] them right straight into the promised
[2:11:04] land it didn't matter whether it was
[2:11:06] unbelievers Egyptians make Believers
[2:11:09] everything else but God took them
[2:11:10] straight to that Promised Land he was he
[2:11:13] was they were anointed he was the
[2:11:15] Messiah then he said how can a man say
[2:11:18] he's a Christian filled with the Holy
[2:11:20] Ghost and deny the word is the same
[2:11:23] yesterday today and forever the Holy
[2:11:26] Ghost in you will punctuate every word
[2:11:28] amen amen amen when the word says
[2:11:32] anything you say that's the
[2:11:35] truth amen it doesn't matter if it's
[2:11:37] Holiness you'll say that's the truth it
[2:11:40] doesn't matter what how you if it's
[2:11:42] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:11:44] you'll say that's the truth if it says
[2:11:47] repent and be be baptized and receive
[2:11:49] the Holy Ghost you can say that's the
[2:11:51] truth that's for
[2:11:54] me don't get the idea just holler an
[2:11:57] amen from your
[2:11:59] seat any poly parot can do that you can
[2:12:02] teach a parrot to say Amen you can teach
[2:12:05] people just to say Amen that can become
[2:12:08] a form of
[2:12:10] godliness exactly right amen but you are
[2:12:14] the anointed word in your life agrees
[2:12:17] with the word whatever he says
[2:12:20] amen so be it let it be in my life
[2:12:26] Lord now the pillar of fire he said in
[2:12:31] the message Paradox is identified
[2:12:34] scientifically and by the same reaction
[2:12:37] by its character and everything else
[2:12:39] just the same as it
[2:12:41] was as it was when it was dwelling in
[2:12:43] the body of God's only begotten son so
[2:12:48] does it dwell in the body of his adopted
[2:12:51] Sons for the last day you are a people
[2:12:55] of the pillar of fire the
[2:12:57] embodiment of the pillar of
[2:13:02] fire now God let us do something very
[2:13:06] special in this
[2:13:09] day he let us have an an identified
[2:13:13] Masterpiece he let us have a a time-
[2:13:17] tested Memorial
[2:13:19] he let us have signs in this day that
[2:13:21] other ages wasn't able to have 74 years
[2:13:25] ago this month in Houston Texas the
[2:13:28] photo of the pillar of fire was
[2:13:31] taken 74 years
[2:13:34] ago it was taken as a debate was held
[2:13:37] between
[2:13:38] campbellites represented by Mr best and
[2:13:42] those who were believing in Hebrews 138
[2:13:45] rest represented by FF
[2:13:49] Bosworth and God Vivic himself bearing
[2:13:52] witness that the message is true that
[2:13:54] truly God has sent Elijah as is promised
[2:13:58] that the pillar of fire has returned can
[2:14:01] I say it to this
[2:14:05] generation and I want to say because
[2:14:07] brother brandham left is hadn't left it
[2:14:09] is still
[2:14:11] here but it's embodied in a
[2:14:15] people each one of you have an hard of
[2:14:18] that lick of fire that's what happened
[2:14:21] on the day of Pentecost somebody help me
[2:14:22] preach it happened that way so he says
[2:14:26] it's harvest time then then there must
[2:14:28] come upon the scene in those AGS those
[2:14:31] who will bring the wheat and the tears
[2:14:32] to maturity the tears are already
[2:14:35] maturing very fast under corrupt
[2:14:37] teachers who turn the people from the
[2:14:39] word so that will that will bring terrs
[2:14:42] to maturity but the word wheat must also
[2:14:46] mature and to her God is sending the
[2:14:50] prophet messenger with the Vindicated
[2:14:52] Ministry that he might be accepted by
[2:14:55] the elect they will hear him as the
[2:14:58] first church heard Paul and she are you
[2:15:01] ready for this she will mature in the
[2:15:04] word un becoming a word
[2:15:07] bride the mighty Works will be found in
[2:15:10] her that are always attended upon the
[2:15:13] pure word and
[2:15:15] Faith so let's get it clear what what
[2:15:18] was the whole purpose of it is that God
[2:15:20] would send a message to bring a bride to
[2:15:24] maturity the
[2:15:26] light amen and they will hear him as the
[2:15:28] first church heard Paul and she will
[2:15:31] mature in the word unto becoming a word
[2:15:34] bride and the mighty Works will be found
[2:15:37] in her that are always attended upon the
[2:15:40] pure word and
[2:15:42] Faith so you can't have the pure word
[2:15:44] without Mighty
[2:15:46] works
[2:15:49] am you can't be a Word Church Without
[2:15:52] Mighty
[2:15:54] Works come on
[2:15:58] now when an individual in Christ becomes
[2:16:01] one that person is an adopted son as
[2:16:05] brother Bram said in the in Jehovah Gyra
[2:16:07] the very life that was in Christ is in
[2:16:09] you that shows he's your Redeemer he's
[2:16:12] adopted you into God and now we are Sons
[2:16:15] and Daughters of God with the spirit of
[2:16:18] God Amen The Works that I do you'll do
[2:16:20] also and greater this for you do for I
[2:16:21] go to my father he talks about how in
[2:16:24] the message look if you hadn't listened
[2:16:27] to it it's a great message one in
[2:16:28] Phoenix in the in April 28th I I I was
[2:16:32] reading it one time on a on a on an
[2:16:35] airplane and and um you know just came
[2:16:37] out of meetings I I just sat there and
[2:16:39] wept through the whole thing because
[2:16:42] brother Brandon was talking about how
[2:16:43] that you know you could take a camera
[2:16:45] and he used an example of having a
[2:16:48] camera and and he had it there but it
[2:16:49] was out of focus instead of seeing one
[2:16:52] deer out there what his he was seeing
[2:16:54] three deer and he said you know Billy
[2:16:58] something's wrong with this thing and he
[2:16:59] said that it's out of focus so he he
[2:17:01] focused it and and all the three became
[2:17:06] one amen now the same thing and he
[2:17:09] begins his old message of look look what
[2:17:12] are you looking at if you say look what
[2:17:13] is there to look at I've got to bring it
[2:17:15] in focus and that's what this message is
[2:17:19] to do is to bring all of these truth
[2:17:21] into
[2:17:23] Focus amen what Luther had W
[2:17:26] Hada had whatever had bring it all
[2:17:30] together into one glorious message tying
[2:17:32] the loose ends together where you can
[2:17:35] see clearly a bride a word
[2:17:42] bride right so people he said with it
[2:17:45] out of focus try to say these words for
[2:17:47] for for for another age he said it is if
[2:17:50] you're still out from under the
[2:17:53] blood hello but if you're under the
[2:17:56] blood the power by the word by his word
[2:17:59] Remains the
[2:18:01] Same it's got to be the same If he if he
[2:18:04] could do that by the blood of sheep and
[2:18:06] animals and what about the blood of
[2:18:07] Christ you know I can't I just can't
[2:18:09] skim over this sorry I got to bring it
[2:18:13] out people try to say the words those
[2:18:17] words was back for another age they
[2:18:19] don't have to put it back too
[2:18:21] far they can just say it was just for
[2:18:23] the Divine Healing
[2:18:28] movement they can just say it was just
[2:18:30] in brother bram's
[2:18:32] time but we we're in a different season
[2:18:35] you see yes the reason they think that
[2:18:39] they got the word out of
[2:18:42] focus amen and it's and they're bringing
[2:18:45] seeds of discrepancy because you see a
[2:18:48] seed of discrepancy will be any preacher
[2:18:51] who will stand and say that Jesus Christ
[2:18:53] is not the same in every detail that's
[2:18:56] except for his Corporal body I want you
[2:18:59] to understand that's what we believe
[2:19:00] here we believe he is the same in every
[2:19:05] detail except his Corporal body cuz
[2:19:07] right here here's the Corporal body he's
[2:19:09] in the bride so now if you're out from
[2:19:14] under the blood it is those words was
[2:19:16] for another
[2:19:18] but he said if you're under the blood
[2:19:20] the power by of God for his word Remains
[2:19:23] the Same it's got to be the same and he
[2:19:25] said if he could just do that by the
[2:19:27] blood of sheep and animals what about
[2:19:29] the blood of Jesus Christ I could do it
[2:19:31] we must we must cope our lives and focus
[2:19:34] it in the word of God just like we would
[2:19:36] picture a camera or try to get the right
[2:19:38] Focus before we snap it and then when we
[2:19:41] got the real true picture and that's
[2:19:43] what we want to do is focus our lives
[2:19:47] into Jesus Christ that Christ and you
[2:19:51] become the same person you are a son
[2:19:54] adopted to God by the blood of the
[2:19:58] righteous Jesus
[2:20:00] Christ so when you get it into
[2:20:04] Focus you will see you are a son adopted
[2:20:09] by God positioned as a word
[2:20:12] bride in this last day to defeat the
[2:20:16] enemy

[2:20:31] of your life and you're one with Christ
[2:20:34] come on somebody help me preach amen you
[2:20:36] are one in Christ Jesus and when you get
[2:20:38] in Focus you will see yourself as a Son
[2:20:41] of God let me tell you every time you

[2:20:45] in focus

[2:22:24] church a people who are the
[2:22:28] word they are the Original
[2:22:35] Seed what was planted on the day of the
[2:22:38] Pentecost here now back again the
[2:22:40] Original
[2:22:41] Seed they were the word church there
[2:22:44] were the word church
[2:22:46] nowall and the message token brother
[2:22:49] Brandon said we have a token in this day
[2:22:51] we've been given a token which is an
[2:22:54] anot type of that type of a natur that
[2:22:56] natural type token we have been given
[2:22:59] the supernatural Supreme token that's
[2:23:02] been foreshadowed has been all that's
[2:23:04] been foreshadowed has been given to this
[2:23:06] generation has been given the token now
[2:23:09] we have the Holy Ghost is our token and
[2:23:13] it is our identification that we have
[2:23:15] accepted the death of the Lamb Not only
[2:23:17] was Jesus a human life to come back just
[2:23:21] a human life to come back on us but it
[2:23:24] was God
[2:23:26] himself stop for a minute remember the
[2:23:28] problem with the with the woolly lamb
[2:23:31] his innocency and his life could not
[2:23:34] come back upon them so he remained a
[2:23:38] sinner right so he come with his lamb
[2:23:42] and he had s lamb was without blemish
[2:23:44] lamb was accepted he went away with the
[2:23:47] the same old
[2:23:49] vices same old evil desires same old
[2:23:52] ways come on with the same way he come
[2:23:54] in except
[2:23:59] forgiven
[2:24:01] amen and and now you see the life of
[2:24:05] Abraham the life of a just man could not
[2:24:09] come back upon us because of that man
[2:24:12] had no his blood had no power to atone
[2:24:15] so Jesus couldn't do this just is a
[2:24:17] human but it was God manifested In the
[2:24:20] Flesh are you with me he said it was God
[2:24:23] manifested In the Flesh that brought
[2:24:25] back upon us the adoption of sons that
[2:24:29] now we are the sons and daughters of
[2:24:32] God
[2:24:34] hallelujah amen now so we're predestined
[2:24:38] guess what we're predestined do we're
[2:24:41] predestined not to
[2:24:45] fall your destiny has been
[2:24:49] set amen your destiny has been set
[2:24:53] you're predestinated not tool you see
[2:24:56] brother brandham said that knowing Eve
[2:24:59] would fall from disbelieving the word
[2:25:02] knowing she would
[2:25:04] fall he said but he chose a bride that
[2:25:09] would not
[2:25:11] fall that would hold to the word
[2:25:14] regardless of what all the rest the
[2:25:17] world had to say about it they would
[2:25:19] hold to that word they are
[2:25:22] predestined to stand there the adoption
[2:25:25] of children by Jesus Christ
[2:25:28] predestinated to the church to that
[2:25:32] great glorious
[2:25:34] stand Hallelujah a bride who will not
[2:25:38] fall now you know brother brandom said
[2:25:41] of the Zeus of movement they could not
[2:25:43] wait he said you know like Eve she
[2:25:45] couldn't wait for the Brahma be
[2:25:47] fulfilled so she gave her womb to to the
[2:25:49] serpent right amen and he talks about
[2:25:53] you know some of the others who could
[2:25:54] not wait and he says and he said about
[2:25:58] the isua movement that they couldn't
[2:26:00] wait for the token so they sought a
[2:26:04] phony makeup with jumping and screaming
[2:26:07] and speaking in
[2:26:08] tongues getting people down the Altar
[2:26:11] and jiggling their tongue up and down
[2:26:13] till they got a confusion of
[2:26:15] language and that that's what brother
[2:26:17] Brandon said when the perfect word has
[2:26:19] come and that that is over
[2:26:25] with that jumping up and down and trying
[2:26:28] to speak with tongues is over
[2:26:31] with now speaking in tongues isn't over
[2:26:34] with but jumping up and down to try to
[2:26:36] speak with tongues is over
[2:26:38] with Hallelujah we don't jump get it we
[2:26:41] jump because we got
[2:26:44] it Hallelujah but they Pride you see to
[2:26:47] work up a phony makeup with screaming
[2:26:50] jumping and speaking in tongues instead
[2:26:52] of waiting for the real word of God to
[2:26:55] be made manifest through the
[2:26:57] bride you see but I wanted to say it's
[2:27:00] the hour and we don't have to have phony
[2:27:04] makeup you know we and and of course we
[2:27:07] don't want some kind of phony makeup

[2:31:35] manifest in the bride as God took from
[2:31:37] from the body of Adam the woman and she
[2:31:40] fell then God has took from the body of
[2:31:43] Christ his flesh his body which is the
[2:31:45] word and is bringing a bride that won't
[2:31:48] fall by denomination or Creed no sir

[2:32:31] the blood we're healed by the blood we
[2:32:35] must have the blood how do you get the
[2:32:36] blood well you see on the day there at
[2:32:40] Calvary the blood cell broke open
[2:32:44] releasing the life of God the spirit and
[2:32:46] the Spirit came back on the day of
[2:32:48] Pentecost and when you get the Holy
[2:32:50] Ghost you're born of the blood you are

[2:37:01] emotions don't go up and down you're
[2:37:03] human aren't you so you're nature you
[2:37:06] have
[2:37:07] seasons so you go through you got to go
[2:37:10] through good times bad times your your
[2:37:12] emotions goes up and down but your soul
[2:37:14] remains steady
[2:37:16] I am a Christian no matter what my
[2:37:18] feelings say no matter what the
[2:37:21] circumstances I am a blood bought Son of
[2:37:24] God I know in whom I have believed and I
[2:37:27] don't care what's happening around me
[2:37:29] amen and and if I get to really dwelling
[2:37:32] on that I'll raise up and speak to the
[2:37:34] storm
[2:37:36] hallelujah amen I'm talking about a
[2:37:38] people who can speak to their mountains
[2:37:41] and their mountains have to hear their
[2:37:43] voice and when they speak the mountain
[2:37:47] moves Hallelujah that they can walk on
[2:37:50] Troubled Water and if they fall they'll
[2:37:52] get up again and walk on it again amen
[2:37:55] because they are a people who cannot be
[2:38:03] defeated amen I'm talking about a word
[2:38:07] bride a bride who is the word the same
[2:38:10] as he was the word
[2:38:14] amen
[2:38:18] God is the only form of eternal life
[2:38:21] there is then we were in him from the
[2:38:23] beginning and when Jesus became all that
[2:38:25] word then we were a part of him then
[2:38:28] there you are when that in there there's
[2:38:31] no devil no powers no nothing can ever
[2:38:34] move it that's the tpost of the soul you
[2:38:37] can be anointed out here in the spirit
[2:38:39] and desire and do all these other things
[2:38:42] but when it comes to the toost to that
[2:38:44] word you'll never move from there it'll
[2:38:47] hold right steady and true to that word
[2:38:49] as it can be outside of that regardless
[2:38:52] of what you do you're still
[2:38:56] lost you
[2:38:58] know we get things so out of focus I I'm
[2:39:01] sorry I
[2:39:03] I I have to correct some of the things
[2:39:06] that my Minister Brothers mess
[2:39:09] up God helped me to stay straight not
[2:39:12] mess up things
[2:39:14] myself but you know so I say this
[2:39:18] humbly not as one who is an authority
[2:39:21] over
[2:39:22] everybody but we I hear them say we
[2:39:25] don't need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:39:27] because you could have that every day of
[2:39:29] your life and still die and go to
[2:39:32] hell now it's so sad what the devil
[2:39:36] tries to do with the message and
[2:39:38] convolutes it and makes it hard for you
[2:39:41] to follow and understand sure if the
[2:39:45] Holy Ghost is is just on to human spirit
[2:39:48] and doesn't Quicken your soul I I get
[2:39:50] you some kids that have b him enough
[2:39:52] where they make a confession that they
[2:39:55] believe the message and if that's all
[2:39:57] you have you're going to miss the
[2:40:00] Rapture some gets it upon the human
[2:40:03] spirit and its emotions and they will
[2:40:05] shout and dance and manifest a gift like
[2:40:07] tongues or whatever and if that's all
[2:40:09] you have of the spirit you'll miss the
[2:40:12] Rapture it must Quicken bre bring to
[2:40:15] life the seed within the soul and the
[2:40:18] Very life come in to manifest himself
[2:40:21] and yes you'll believe all of God's word
[2:40:23] and manifest it and yes it will stir
[2:40:26] your emotions and manifest gifts of the
[2:40:28] Spirit and when it comes like that and
[2:40:31] you can never somebody say never never
[2:40:35] be lost
[2:40:38] again seal to the day of
[2:40:42] redemption amen the true baptism of the
[2:40:45] Holy Holy Ghost is a token and you can't
[2:40:47] go to heaven without
[2:40:49] it not in the Rapture no sir and when
[2:40:53] you're sealed in there he said grieve
[2:40:55] not the holy spirit of God whereby
[2:40:57] you're sealed to the day of redemption
[2:40:59] you're sealed in there you're beneath
[2:41:01] the blood you don't go out no more and
[2:41:04] well then what are you God's son and
[2:41:06] God's family sealed by the Holy Spirit
[2:41:09] the devil couldn't get to you if you had
[2:41:11] to for you are dead your old husband
[2:41:13] part is dead and you're buried and your
[2:41:16] life is hid and God to Christ sealed by
[2:41:19] the Holy Ghost how he's going to get to
[2:41:21] you how are you going to get out you're
[2:41:24] there
[2:41:26] Hallelujah that's what he taught in the
[2:41:28] breach he said seal is a security seal
[2:41:31] means you're secure you don't believe in
[2:41:34] eternal security I don't know but a seal
[2:41:36] signifies security to its destination wo
[2:41:38] to that guy that would try to break that
[2:41:40] seal and the Holy Spirit seal cannot be
[2:41:43] broken you all heard me say the people
[2:41:46] said the devil made me do this no no no
[2:41:49] the devil didn't do it you are just
[2:41:50] wasn't sealed in because when you're
[2:41:52] sealed in he's sealed
[2:41:55] out now you went out to him cuz you
[2:41:58] wasn't sealed in amen because if you
[2:42:01] were sealed in the only way he could
[2:42:03] come into you is come to the same
[2:42:05] process you'd have he'd had to be saved
[2:42:07] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:42:09] and then he'd be your brother and the
[2:42:11] devil can't be
[2:42:13] saved so he can't get in where your seal
[2:42:16] is he can't get past the
[2:42:21] seal amen so what the church had at
[2:42:24] Pentecost is her inalienable
[2:42:28] rights amen she has a full token just
[2:42:31] like they had at Pentecost she has the
[2:42:33] full abstract the deed is cleared the
[2:42:36] seals have been open wiping off every
[2:42:39] deed of Satan every claim of Satan
[2:42:41] against us giving us the whole land and
[2:42:45] we have our full rights we have the
[2:42:48] continuation of the son of man Christ
[2:42:51] operating now in a bride
[2:42:53] body as brother Brandon said I challenge
[2:42:56] you to believe that Jesus Christ is
[2:42:58] revealed in the form of the son of man
[2:43:01] in human flesh through the B's the
[2:43:04] bride's body so that's where he's been
[2:43:07] revealed now while ausa Street Revival
[2:43:12] restored gifts and power to the church
[2:43:17] it was not the complete
[2:43:19] word so there was no way to restore the
[2:43:21] full token they didn't have
[2:43:24] it
[2:43:26] hello amen you see the level of the Holy
[2:43:29] Ghost possible to any churches depended
[2:43:32] directly upon the level of the word it
[2:43:36] had revealed to it brother Brandon would
[2:43:39] call it the dip of the
[2:43:41] spirit but this is no little
[2:43:44] dip
[2:43:45] hello this is no anointing no mere
[2:43:49] anointing I meant to say this is he
[2:43:52] himself coming this is the rising of
[2:43:55] sons full Sons mature Sons with power
[2:43:58] and authority over the
[2:44:00] flesh over sin and over the devil amen
[2:44:05] they cast him
[2:44:07] out he can't cast them out of the
[2:44:11] body come on he obeys them they don't
[2:44:15] obey
[2:44:17] him he flees from them we stand our
[2:44:21] ground on the word so these Sons cannot
[2:44:25] fall they let me repeat they cannot fall
[2:44:30] uh second Peter 1 and 10 wherefore there
[2:44:32] rather Brethren give diligence to make
[2:44:34] your calling an election sure for if you
[2:44:37] do these things have an added your faith
[2:44:39] virtue virtue knowledge coming through
[2:44:41] the levels of sanctification and then
[2:44:43] sealed with the Holy Ghost if you do
[2:44:45] these things you shall never
[2:44:47] fall that's the word of God now so being
[2:44:51] baptized by this token into the body of
[2:44:53] Christ First Corinthians 12 we are now
[2:44:56] subject to the gifts of the Spirit that
[2:44:58] are in there the world don't believe in
[2:45:01] gifts the church don't believe in gifts
[2:45:02] but God word said there is gifts and it
[2:45:05] it takes only that token that's the Holy
[2:45:08] Ghost to identify those gifts and in him
[2:45:12] is all the fullness in him is all the
[2:45:14] fullness of God and all the fullness of
[2:45:15] the promise and when we're baptized in
[2:45:17] him we have every promise that God made
[2:45:19] laid at our fingertip no sin is there no
[2:45:22] death is there even sickness can't stay
[2:45:24] in his presence if Satan then puts his
[2:45:27] hand to you and tries to tempt you into
[2:45:30] something you hold your token in your
[2:45:32] hands and show it that you are redeemed
[2:45:35] product of Jesus
[2:45:37] Christ Hallelujah and let your
[2:45:40] unadulterated Faith wave that token
[2:45:43] there and say I am a product that Jesus
[2:45:46] Christ bought sickness
[2:45:49] flees Hallelujah
[2:45:52] now where we at let's try to bring this
[2:45:56] down here I want to just I I just want
[2:45:59] to get get some of the thoughts here for
[2:46:01] a moment I want you to understand the
[2:46:04] ministry of the
[2:46:06] bride and the ministry of Christ is the
[2:46:13] same if we're the fulfillment of the New
[2:46:16] Testament then the ministry of Christ
[2:46:19] and the ministry of the Bride is the
[2:46:22] same as he said it has to be because a
[2:46:25] woman and a husband come become one and
[2:46:28] so does the Bride In Christ become one
[2:46:31] remember the former treaties o
[2:46:32] Theophilus that I wrote to you that
[2:46:34] Jesus began to do and continues to do
[2:46:38] his death didn't stop him no sir he
[2:46:41] returned again not a third person but
[2:46:43] the safe per the the same person
[2:46:46] returned again in the form of the Holy
[2:46:48] Ghost to continue the work on and
[2:46:50] continues on says the book of Acts Jesus
[2:46:52] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:46:56] forever that's the
[2:46:59] token so you know where we're at in this
[2:47:01] hour this is the hour that the token has
[2:47:05] to be on
[2:47:07] display you see they had they had making
[2:47:12] preparations for it in the other AG just
[2:47:15] like the first part with Israel was go
[2:47:18] get a lamb examine that lamb see that
[2:47:21] it's without
[2:47:23] blemish right and you won't keep it up
[2:47:26] for so many days and until um you you
[2:47:30] you discovered there's no blemish in
[2:47:32] this land and you see that's been the
[2:47:35] the the the Baptist and the Lutheran
[2:47:37] message is the cross and you know the
[2:47:40] Lambs without blemish and he's a worthy
[2:47:42] Savior and he's a great God and he came
[2:47:45] fles and you know of course they think
[2:47:47] he's one of three people that did but
[2:47:49] anyway you know they a little mixed up
[2:47:51] here and there but nevertheless you know
[2:47:54] that you know that they kept up the lamb
[2:47:56] it was lamb time in Luther it was lamb
[2:48:00] time in Wesley it was even lamb time in
[2:48:03] in ausa Street it was the time of the
[2:48:07] keeping up of the lamb but there comes a
[2:48:09] time where that the Lamb's blood must be
[2:48:13] applied
[2:48:16] that it will no longer work just having
[2:48:19] the
[2:48:20] lamb and and talking about his inoc and
[2:48:23] see and how good he was and he was a man
[2:48:26] he walked the shores of Galilee and he
[2:48:28] did all of this it it comes beyond that
[2:48:30] come on somebody amen it's the time
[2:48:33] where the life that was in the lamb must
[2:48:37] come back upon the believer producing
[2:48:40] the literal life of Jesus Christ making
[2:48:43] adopted Sons place in the
[2:48:48] body as his sons recognized in position
[2:48:53] now of course this same thing happened
[2:48:57] there when even as far as even Acts 19
[2:49:00] you see they had believed on the Lord
[2:49:02] they they had believed on the Lord they
[2:49:05] had uh they had confessed his name and
[2:49:07] he said well how was you baptized well
[2:49:09] unto John's baptism well that was a good
[2:49:11] baptism but there's something more now
[2:49:14] okay well how do we be baptized well
[2:49:16] it's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:49:17] Christ and you know well okay have you
[2:49:20] received the Holy Ghost since you
[2:49:21] believed see we we went right back to
[2:49:24] baptist message in the in the message
[2:49:27] ranks we believe when you believe
[2:49:30] brother Bri was a prophet you got the
[2:49:32] Holy Ghost you believe everything he
[2:49:34] said yeah I believe it I believe he as a
[2:49:37] prophet so I believe it all you're no
[2:49:39] more than a Baptist sorry that's as far
[2:49:41] as you
[2:49:43] come
[2:49:45] you just traded you just traded the name
[2:49:48] of Jesus for William bradam shame on
[2:49:54] you I said shame on
[2:49:56] you amen listen we want to bring it
[2:49:59] right down to the nitty-gritty right now
[2:50:02] you you just realize that's as far as
[2:50:04] many of them have come just to that very
[2:50:06] place but you see when here again what
[2:50:11] happened I'm quoting brother Brandon
[2:50:13] called Paul commanded them to be
[2:50:15] baptized over again in the name of Jesus
[2:50:17] Christ and when he did this the token
[2:50:19] Came Upon them and they were identified
[2:50:22] by the works and signs of the Holy Ghost
[2:50:24] speaking in tongues through them and
[2:50:26] prophesying and magnifying God they were
[2:50:29] identified with their sacrifice it
[2:50:32] didn't come without
[2:50:38] Supernatural
[2:50:40] now I'm going to take the next 15
[2:50:43] minutes
[2:50:45] and more if I need
[2:50:48] to what is meant by the
[2:50:51] word just
[2:50:54] what well before it became word logos
[2:51:00] spoken it was
[2:51:05] spirit so the word first is
[2:51:10] Spirit In the Beginning was the word was
[2:51:15] it a
[2:51:17] book did a Bible come out from
[2:51:21] God did a 1100 tapes come
[2:51:25] out a stack of message books a bunch of
[2:51:29] quotes is that what it was in the
[2:51:31] beginning was the word was it a
[2:51:34] teaching it was a teaching came out from
[2:51:38] God in the
[2:51:40] beginning a
[2:51:43] Doctrine
[2:51:45] a Creed that Creed means I
[2:51:48] Believe by the way it's not a bad name
[2:51:50] brother
[2:51:52] Creed it just means I
[2:51:55] believe and so when it becomes a Creed
[2:51:58] it becomes a form of this is what we
[2:52:02] believe and there's no life to
[2:52:06] it
[2:52:08] now so what was it was it a book a
[2:52:12] teaching a Doctrine no what came out of
[2:52:16] God a
[2:52:19] person it was the Holy Spirit that's
[2:52:23] right that's right now that's why you
[2:52:26] can't really have the word until you get
[2:52:31] the
[2:52:36] spirit you see we got it backward we
[2:52:39] think we get the word and then we get
[2:52:40] the spirit you got to have the spirit
[2:52:43] when the spirit of truth comes into
[2:52:47] you are you with me truth is a
[2:52:50] spirit and it ain't receiving the Creed
[2:52:53] it isn't received the doctrine it isn't
[2:52:55] receiving the teaching it's receiving
[2:52:57] the
[2:52:58] spirit and when you receive the spirit
[2:53:01] it makes you obey the
[2:53:06] word because long before the word was
[2:53:09] ever written it was
[2:53:12] Spirit that's right
[2:53:15] and long before it was taught by the
[2:53:17] teachers it was
[2:53:20] spirit and when it is properly taught
[2:53:24] it's not a lecture is not an
[2:53:26] intellectual talk but it's
[2:53:30] Spirit hallelujah amen Jesus said the
[2:53:34] words I speak are
[2:53:35] spirit and when a preacher really
[2:53:38] preaches the words they are spirit and
[2:53:40] when they go forth they knock out doubt
[2:53:43] unbelief confus conf usion Distortion
[2:53:46] everything else come on it knocks it all
[2:53:48] out why the spirit is going back through
[2:53:51] the word and as it does it's casting out
[2:53:55] Devils casting out unbelief causing the
[2:53:58] faith to come in causing the people to
[2:54:00] rise to accept the promise causing and
[2:54:03] amen so be it Hallelujah to rise up in
[2:54:07] the people and works to be begin to
[2:54:12] follow and when it's properly Tau
[2:54:15] is not an intellectual talk it's the
[2:54:18] spirit that's why we are ministers not
