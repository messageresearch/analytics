and Lord we're so thankful that we have a hope more than a hope father we have an anchor God we have a rock that's steadfast and sure Lord and a promise of another tomorrow Lord Lord we're just pilgrims and strangers just passing through this land lord and we know Lord there's a there's a crossing over there's a better time a better place so Lord we just come to you tonight in the midweek service and Lord you see what you've laid upon the my heart tonight and we just want to get ourselves out of the way and allow you to deliver Lord that which you placed there and I pray Lord we would come as a people Lord I know many of us our hearts may be heavy tonight but God may you just take the words and break the bread of life Lord and on our ears to hear what the spirit would have said in this hour for this service for this moment Lord we ask it now in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles tonight we have you look here in Philippians 1 and verse 6 we're also going to look in Hebrews 12 and verse2 for our our two places of scripture reading tonight we find here in Philippians 1 and verse6 it says being confident of this very thing that he which began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ so notice he he which began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ also Hebrews 12 and verse2 looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God God bless you Saints you can have your seats tonight I want to speak to you tonight as I was sitting here Sunday and taking in the great message that brother Tim had preached on on the crossing over and believe that we are people that has crossed over I believe we got to come out of this time element that we're in understanding that we live in it day by day but I think this is we got to look beyond the the natural the humanity and look into a land that flows with milk and honey and I was as I was thinking there and just listening to it the Lord just kind of dropped this in my heart he said he will finish it so I want to speak to you tonight on he will finish it and we find here this word finisher in Hebrews 12 and verse2 it means he will he's the completer he's the perfector so this is who God is this is one of his attributes is he is a completer he is a perfector he's not like you and I who could start a job only to stop halfway God doesn't stop halfway if God ever starts something God's going to see it all the way through to completion and we find here that you as sons of God and and myself we as Believers tonight we can be confident of this very thing that he which began the good work he that started this good work in you will perform it otherwise he will completed so this good work is a work that only God does it's not anything to do with man this is called the work of God the work of the Lord or the work at Christ and Paul is affirming here that man has nothing to do with this work this is solely on God and God's merits and God's claim and God's uh God's uh purpose for your life man has nothing to do with it we find in John 1 and verse2 but as many that have received him notice to them gave them or he gave them the power to become the sons of God nothing that we had to do nothing that your favorite preacher had to do nothing that a service had to do with it but God Almighty because he knew there would be Sons and Daughters of God that would come to this truth so God started the work and God provided you the avenue to which you can become yet a son and daughter of god notice he says now even to them which believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God all this is because God so we find here we can be confident that's right even in our lowest days our lowest weakest moments Even in our most frail uh uh humanity and our sickest elements in life notice the times of Despair when we lose a loved one we can still be confident of this very thing that he that began the good work and let me tell you it's a good work Church some of you look back over your life and see where you were and see where you are now it's a good work matter of fact it's a great work and not man could do this work man doesn't have the longevity to perform this but almighty God does God started it God will finish it yes sir notice now we can be confident that God began the work notice where did he begin it in the thoughts in his thoughts you know brother Jackson you got good thoughts but tomorrow your thoughts can change but if God ever had a thought about you it's a perfect thought it's an eternal thought it's lasting thought it's a thought not only in your beginning in your origin but God's already saw that thought to completion I say oh blessed be the name of the Lord tonight some of you are facing some difficult moments in life but I want you to know God has already seen the finished product God has already seen you in Victory God has already said I am going to finish it I started it I'll see it to completion am he desired notice God desired to have fellowship with you amen come on church this should have been a better amen than that God desired to have fellowship with you he knew what age to bring you in he knew what family to allow you to be born into he washed over that seed he knew what church to place you in cuz a certain atmosphere can Quicken that sea and bring the full development of what God has intended see if God was so careful to bring you in this age into the prospective family which you were born in a family that believes the message place you in the right church with the right atmosphere I ask you won't he finish what he started if he thought so much and wased over that seed all the way down through world wars through fires and calamities God has always watched over that sea he began it not when you came to the Earth not when you came to the altar not when you were born again but God started that in his very thoughts that he had of you before you ever came here right notice and the Bible tells us that the work now that he started he's going to complete this word work there means something which he undertakes it can be done by the accomplishment of his hands or the industry or his mind right right so God started in his mind God was not God but before yet he made the angels and when he made the angels and they worshiped him then he became God but God wanted somebody that would love him somebody that will reciprocate that same love that he has for his creation therefore God thought of you come on even tonight wake up tonight God thought of you why cuz you're the only one that can reciprocate the love of God oh my he said he will perform it that word there performing to bring to an end to finish to complete to perfect you look in the mirror every morning and you see a lot of flaws at least I do oh but when I look through godm when he looks at me he's not looking at my frail Humanity he's not looking at my weaknesses he's not looking at me in my difficulties no God is looking at me at the very thought that he have and as your Prophet said he took a picture you at your best come on even the light he took a picture of you at your best you didn't remember that but God does because you was in his thoughts and what he saw there he's going to manifest here amen notice he will perform He will carry it forward to completion he will perfect it yes sir that's right it will be carried through to the end so when did this work begin you find the answer in the Easter seal he said there's only one life one eternal spirit one eternal life and that's God God Alone is eternal and then we being his children are part of him that is the attributes of his thinking and the thought is expressed and becomes a word then each individual here come on are you here tonight amen let your mouth know it let your head know it let your body know it I'm here we're here he says we're here tonight that possesses eternal life was before the foundation of the world in God's thinking so all of you here tonight that was that are here and I'm assuming you are that you possess eternal life you was in God thinking before the foundation of the world he said it's the only way it could be cuz you're an attribute so you are an attribute of God that's right you and all your issues all your family strains all that that God mixed into that and made you who you are yet God said that's my attribute and yet all we can see is all the issues but God don't see issues God sees Perfection because God's not looking at the in between he's looking at the beginning Alpha is going to be Omega and Omega is going to be Alpha they're going to be the same church and notice what he says now we become Sons and Daughters of God through that same Spirit by the same forn knowledge of God we are an attribute of God that's an expression of a thought and has become a word and the word has to take in life and it's Eternal oh Church yes it means that what he started out with Genesis he will finish in Revelation am not that oh I'm going to have stars and I'm going to have moons and I'm going to have mountains and I'm going to have beaches and I'm going to have this age and that age no God had a lot more going on in the beginning amen God had a desire an overwhelming desire what was God doing God had a desire to have a family I know I preached on this but I'm going to keep preaching on until God gets it off my heart but God had a desire to have a family you know I told my wife when I got married I was predestinated to be married I didn't like to be alone come on oh man I got one two brothers got their hand raised up come on Church man I hated being alone oh but I'm going tell you I was meant to be married and God hates to be alone God didn't want to just dwell with his thoughts God wanted those thoughts to come into manifestation he wanted somebody that he could love and more important he wanted somebody that would love him back so you were in God's thinking when God was Desiring a family see he was expressing this great desire to have a bride and God when he had those thoughts he had you in his mind that's right you were part of that before you was ever born before you ever had that first trial that first sickness that first heartache over a loss of a love him before you ever felt lonely being rejected and dejected God had you in his thinking where did he what did he say to job job where were you you know job had a lot of calamities in life job's lost his health he lost his wealth he lost his children his wife someone you just cursed God and die and yet God said Joe where were you before all this took place before you was ever born he was reminding job job you was on the other side with the sons of God shouting and rejoicing God didn't see job's difficulties he didn't see job go down in defeat no but God saw job rejoicing over his calamities God saw Jo rejoicing in Victory because he didn't let these things P him down because he knew that oh blessed be the L of the Lord though the skin worms destroy this body yet in this place I'm going to see my Creator I'm going to see the one that had me in this thought before the foundation of the world see God and God doesn't see your defeat church he sees your VCT Victory yes sir amen he sees your Victory that's right the Bible would tell us in 2 Thessalonians 2 and verse 13 that God ha from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth where unto he called you by Our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ so we were chosen not from our birth that's right we were chosen not when we accept Christ as our savior we were chosen not when we came to the altar at a special meeting but we were chosen from the beginning he would tell us in Ephesians that we are chosen where in him that's right oh Church never forget these fundamentals because when you're flat on your back and the devil's Waring you need to realize where you came from you need to realize that God has jurisdiction over your life not the devil you didn't come from the devil you came from God you came from the Eternal thoughts of God and if those thoughts are Eternal and you were yet there and now you possess the holy spirit that means that God's going to see what he started way back then all the way through and you will be here when there is no tomorrow you will be here when there is no more devil you will be here when there is no more cancer no more heart trouble no more diabetes you will still be here why because you came from almighty God and God is here today to tell you even like Tabernacle I will finish it I will finish what I started don't be distracted by what's going on in the political system in the Nations around us don't be afraid of what you see I God put you here I will see you through we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having made known unto us notice he made known unto us not not everybody but unto us that's right the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he had purposed in himself now in the church age I love what brother Braham says there he says herein now is set forth the love of God anybody want to know this are y'all ready to me just close and go on home and we had Church see he Des notice he said he desired in love a family of his own yeah a family Sons Sons like himself see there before him lies all of mankind as one lump of clay and out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to the image in where in their walks so they're going to be they're going to be trained to conform in the image of their walk and if you go into Christ The Mystery of God revealed we understand that in the back part of God's mind I love how brother Wayne brought this out the other night or the other day when he was talking about uh uh our brother Matthew Spencer and how he was born and at what time he knew what time he knew this he knew his weight he knew all these things but yet he doesn't have any recollection the only way that he remembered only way that he knows is because it was sat in the memory of his mother and what am I telling you tonight you may not remember your origin you may not remember these things but in the mind of God God remembers it and therefore God is coming to tell you I'm going to finish it this is what I'm thinking of you're not some cast down little nobody just barely getting by you are the Queen of Heaven you almighty God is in love with you tonight and he's just looking for you to love him back look beyond your fears look beyond your diffic difficulty and look to the author and the finisher of our faith tonight he's the one so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love in him was to be a father in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a Healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god notice God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and he says and that's what I want to speak on in this church is his hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living in I don't think we had to cut this off and say that only applied to 1963 but I believe we can bring that down today church that God is still unfolding that hidden Mystery and it's a revelation to those that will receive the revelation of it notice God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it and the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour and the Seven Thunders utter their voices and John was forbidden to write it see it's the coming of the Lord so this great mystery this great mystery secret was his coming but not in Groom form this secret was his coming in Bride form see it's him coming now manifesting your life him living and manifesting in the sons of God bringing forth the attributes that all all things that God had wanted ever since the foundation of the world he had typed it in the Bible he had typed Abraham and a Sarah that somebody's going to have a body change and go back to youth again he typed at church he typed it all the way down through with Boaz and Ruth he's going to take a gentile bride he typed it in Joseph taking a gentile bride he typed it in salon and Rahab there why and Rahab was found in the lineage of God cuz some of us we've been ungodly some of us have prostituted our time but God ain't looking at today God is looking at what he had in his mind and he said I'm going to finish it I'm going to finish what I started you was in my thinking I'm going to bring it down into the manifestation in Leia I'm going to call out a bride excuse my excitement but this Thrills me amen notice now he has showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible is an expression of one goal right woo one goal God ain't flirting around with denominational Believers he's got one go I want a wife oh my there's men they go all over this country looking for them a good wife some of them came here we had to kick them out we got a high standard don't we Brothers him we got good women I mean good sisters excuse me sorry about that we got we got a high standard not just anybody and God's looking looking he's looking for somebody that's going to match be a match piece bone of his bone character of his character life of his life is she suitable to be my wife to be my bride cuz he St he's he's looking for those thoughts being made manifest notice we find everywhere in the scriptures it's always been about Christ and a bride just as you brothers and I hope this is true it is for me but just as you Brothers enjoy and love the company of your wife nobody can soothe you like your wife nobody can just pet you like your wife and take that old mean Spirit off of you nobody can love you like your wife and one of my amen yeah so what am I telling you many people wonder they go around and they wonder God what's my purpose why am I here God created you so that you can love him that's your purpose is to love God do you realize nobody can love him like you that's right and nobody can love you like him that's right it's a match made in heaven sir did you hear what I said it's a match made in heaven and let me tell you when I proposed to my wife and I flew to Hawaii and I arranged it all me and sister Rachel from the airplane this is what I want this is the time I want it I want to do this I had party pre-arranged everything all I had to do was wait till she got there oh Hallelujah if you understand what I'm talking about right now God has been waiting he's made all the arrangement he's going to finish it he's just looking for his wife to get there to get in position and let me tell you brother when she got in position I stepped out oh there's just a moment of time when you get in that Godly position that God ordained you to be in he's going to step out from the round parts of glory and come down and snatch away his bride and take her to a wedding supper of the Lamb he's going to finish this work Church he's made you a proposal he ain't backing off of it he's steadfast and TR he's going to go through with this marriage but you got to get yourself ready you got to allow yourself to get ready he said he would take out a gentile for his name's sake notice when the Jews rejected it the Gentiles received it which was a type of the Bride so he would call out a people out of the Gentiles for his name and let me just say this Satan is doing everything he can to uous Union Satan is doing everything he can to keep this marriage from happening to keep the bride from uniting with the groom to get the bride to fall out of love with with him and to fall into love with all these other things right all these vices and oh now you can really be free and no longer held in bondage by all these laws of dos and don'ts but I want you to know Church Satan doesn't have enough power to stop what God already set in motion he doesn't have enough power he doesn't have enough imps he does have enough devils in hell that can stop what God already set in Motion in the beginning right when God thought of you yes those starts are going to come to completion so God so loved you that even when Satan marred Eden's Perfection and he was casting out his son and his daughter he said hold up a second and he brother Brown would tell us those four-letter word L begin to fall down and the blood slapping bloody sheep skin slapping against His Garment as they were walking out but he said hold up I will put imity between thy seed and the seed of the ser serpent what was he saying he said there is going to come a savior God was saying this is not the end of it I'm going to finish this I'm going to provide you a savior and his heel will bruise his head and his head will bruise his heel what was God saying God said this ain't over this ain't the finality of it I'm still on the throne I'm still going to see this work all the way through I will have a bride and I'm going to take her back to another Eden and this time let me tell you Church in Satan's eating he's calling out a Perfect Bride oh Hallelujah somebody should say Amen to that in all the chaos you look around wars and rumors of wars National strife and yet and through all of this God is calling out an elect oh Hallelujah see Satan was confident that he conquered God's purpose and he ruined his his plan of perfection of a garden and a family but God had attributes see God had attributes to be a savior so in other to be a savior he had to have man to be able to fall in order that he could be the Savior notice now he says how could he save L there's something lost and if God was attributes before there was an angel or a molecule or anything God was by himself alone but he wasn't God cuz God is an optic of worship there was nothing for him to worship or to worship him nothing to worship him but his attributes attributes displayed something and made an Angel then he was God then he made man give him free moral agency and he fell then when he fell he became a savior and in the fall he took sickness so he became a Healer see it's all displaying God's attributes but in this great God Elohim was attributes there was attributes to there to be God attributes to be a father attributes to be a son attributes to be a savior attributes to be a Healer all these attributes was in God God that's right and it looked like it was over Perfection was over God was God was only making a a masterpiece yes that's right God started a masterpiece what he was going to do and bring it out all the way and it's going to bring it through seven Church ages he's going to have a bride out of every age but let me just tell you she's going to culminate in that final age oh what he planted in that first age is an infant bride she's going to come to maturity and she's going to be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh power of his power she is going to be the very manifestation of God himself everything that he believ she believ she knows what he wants done with his word or she keeps still she's not moving unless Papa God or husband tell her to move why because her desires is to him and to him alone it ain't to family it ain't the friend it ain't the favorite preacher it ain't to some church it ain't to some denomination it ain't to some job it ain't ain't to some school it ain't to some career her love and her affection is solely unto her Creator and he knows that therefore he comes service after service that's why he chips that's why he mows that's why he rubs that's why he shakes because God is shaping a masterpiece and some of you ouch some of you oh well somebody must have told the preacher and stepped on my toes no God is perfecting his Masterpiece cuz he's going to finish it what Michelangelo had in his mind brother Tim he had to see it all the way through fruition and when it met it met what he felt was perfect then he spoke to it and struck it oh Church don't you see what God is doing in this hour God said you must prophesy again you had reached that final perfecting element to where now it's not him speaking but it's now you are the final voice to the final age now God's coming in Bride form to can finish what he didn't finish when he was here in Groom form oh Church notice what he says here in Le in church age he said his very existence is for his own his love he loves them and cares for them His Eye Is ever upon them and we find and I believe it's Zachariah somewhere he says he that touches Israel touches the apple of his eye let me tell you you are the very apple of God's eye and when you look into the apple or the pupil of a man's eye you see your reflection of the man otherwise it's called the little man of the eye and what God is saying when I look into your eyes I see myself and when you look into the eyes of God you see who God is what am I telling you church when they touch you tonight with that devil of hell trying to touch this little bride he touches the very apple of God's eye he touches the very heart of almighty God and he's got Heaven on his hand God's going to finish this [Applause] work Netanyahu made a comment the other day he said oh Israel we didn't start this war but we will finish it let me tell you devil we didn't start this war but there's a bride here tonight and she is going to finish she's going to be bone of his bone life of his life she's going to receive that work and we will finish this work God is going to have a bride God is going to have a body God will finish this [Applause] work oh my we find in Jeremiah 29 he was tell us I know the thoughts I know the thoughts how did he know the thoughts because they originated before the foundation yes I know the plans I know the purpose and he says thoughts of Peace come completion finish work God already knows all this the problem is we don't know it that's right all right but you got to start combing this word CU everything you need is right here yes sir just start God you know the thoughts you have toward me thoughts of peace and not of evil to bring me to an expected end God you already know the end from the beginning you know the beginning and you know my ending oh Church see you're the focus of God's attention my wife she's the focus of my attention there's a lot of nice looking sisters here but you don't have my attention there's a lot of nice ladies out there I ni churches out there doing God great things but they don't have his attention you have his attention amen you have his attention that's right yes and he has your attention that's why we can create an atmosphere on a Wednesday night to where our Wednesday night service can be as climactic as Sunday because there's no falling off on a Wednesday night because why because we have his attention and he has ours he wants every service to be a love affair where he comes and begins to reveal himself to you in a way that maybe you have not quite known notice what he says here let me just say what he says this word focus a synonym for Focus means emphasis heart motivation concentration so you are the focus of his attention you are the emphasis you are his heart you are his concentration sir see his seed is his focus and I got a whole another series on that or another study on that alone and but we find see when he said let's make man in our image you were that Focus then and now we find ourselves down in the last Church age and he's not lost Focus Church that's right you still have his attention there's going to be a bride there's going to be someone that's going to love me and love and receive my message there's going to be a a Rebecca that listens to that elaser and says oh I didn't know him I don't know what he looks like all I've heard is all these things but I'm in love love with him already no she didn't fall in love with elzer she fell in love with Isaac and her heart longed to meet Isaac oh church I hope your heart tonight is longing to meet your Isaac to meet him so notice he never stopped thinking of his bride we find here in Psalms 121 and verse1 oh song of degrees I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from which cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which had made heavens and earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not Slumber behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from the time forth even ever more notice you are are God's absolute focus in this hour he knows you're going in he knows you're coming out he knows your good days he knows your bad days he knows when you're sick he knows when you're not sick he knows when you're up he knows when you're down but I want you to know you got God's attention and you got God's obligation I'm going to watch over you through the thick and thin of I'm going to see you Crest every wave I'm going to see you Climb Every Mountain and I'm going to bring be with you when you pull through the valleys I'm going to be there I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I will finish what I started he would tell us in job or Joel Excuse Me joob 2 verse2 I will restore the word restore means to finish I will finish it all that the caliper cankerworm polymer worm Locust all that they ate I'm going to finish it I'm going to make good on my promise that's right oh come on church he said and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied there ain't no lack of food at evening like Tabernacle come on Church there ain't no lack of food you get fed Sundays Wednesday and if we had Church seven days a week I promise you you'll be fed seven days a week you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God oh Satan you might as well take your hand off with this bride tonight cuz we're not eating at your table we're feasting on Heavenly mana and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God sometimes we just need to be reminded that's right that he's in our midst yeah and that he is the Lord Our God I will restore what is God saying he's prophesying that what I started I'm going to finish it amen and there ain't no devil there ain't no cankerworm there ain't no Church politics there ain't no favorite this and favorite that and jealousy this and this one here big eyes and little you is going to get in my way I'm going to finish I'm going to have a bride that's right yes sir oh yeah I am going to have a bride and his word notice what he says here in trying to do God or servants without being the will of God God promised that he would bring his bride out what he would do he said there would be a seed that there would be a light in the evening time how he would do all these things just exactly and by the way that he originally planted in the Old Testament in the New Testament and it isn't through denominations God had a plan and that plan was always revealing his word through the prophets amen and God already put it in the scriptures Malachi 4 behold I send who I send you you my bride I'm sending you an eleazer I'm sending it to you I'm going to finish that's right don't fall in love with eleazer be thankful God he's going he's the one that's going to get you to me but God won't you to fall in love with him but God has placed it all the way through the scriptures Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 all this what God is getting a bride ready cuz he's got an obligation he's got a desire I want a family the only way I can have a family is I got to have a wife I got to have a bride I got to have a match piece that we can bring forth life in this hour and God's desire is to have that wife somebody that he can just pull up close to him and Whisper those Secrets how many of you Brothers tell your wife Secrets oh a't three of y'all am you tell your wife everything you should yes sir you tell her you know tell her things brother El that you don't don't me tell anybody else right because there's a special bond there's a special connection there's a special relationship and that's what God has done he's brought you close and he's Whispering those things to you because there's a special connection a special bond he can't just tell it to everybody it's not for everybody but it's for you go Whispering her ear brother H tell her you lover her uhhuh you're too busy over there talking there you go that's what you do he said the evening message must carry evening results we're not in the first stage Church we're in the last stage it's the evening time message it's got to produce evening time results what are those results a bride a bride the evening message must seow evening seeds not morning seeds evening seeds is that right midday seene he said it seeds back there was denomination it died perish but evening time message will show evening time light will show evening time results evening time message Jesus time midday message showed midday results but the beginning message showed the beginning the beginning results made creation he made a son In His Image in the midday but in the evening time he makes a bride for it what by by the word how did he formed the Earth he said he spoke it into existence by the word who is who who was the son his word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us how will he take his bride by by the word that's right not by a new cart not by some the Theologian idea but according to his word he will identify her and the fact that you can receive this message and receive a prophet and receive the prophet's reward what is that becoming the bride that's right shows that God has got you as his Focus but we find today in the hour in which we're living in mama just speed on through here but we find in the hour we're living in in the evening time there's also a thing called Satan's eating and we find that Satan is so longed to have what God have that he injected himself in humanity because Satan could not create in the beginning he cannot create now but he knew that God had a plan God had a desire that desire was to to have a family and Satan so long to inject himself in humanity that he crossed over he knew that he couldn't come into Humanity but he came through The Serpent and the serpent seduced Eve that's how for he injected himself into the human race and he brought all the fall brought all the destruction but yet it was all working according to the plan of God because in God's mind he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a deliverer when cancer would strike your body he wanted to be the one that says I put my foot on it I finishes tonight in the name of Jesus Christ no cancer can stand before the believer's prayer not even cancer church and if it means so much for that what about every promise that lays in there Satan has attacked his body he's attacked his bride but God has the final [Music] say brother B said he had 6,000 years to create this seed and what a wonderful creation we're living in yes I mean look at Israel right now bombarded on every side yes look at the LBGTQ agenda coming after your kids look at the stuff that you can't even hardly listen to on the on the radio radio anymore because it's all a conglomeration of Filth things on the movie scene you got nothing if you have any kind of commercials trying to look at anything decent and there's commercials it's all about filth it's all about from that region of Darkness everything is just coming up with the purpose in the plan to destroy the elect but see see Satan's plan his purpose was to inject himself in the human race in order to destroy the seed line of God but God's purpose in his plan is to protect that's right to protect to Shield to finish what he started that's right he's going to have a masterpiece he would tell us in the exposition of the church ages Christ in the true the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts notice but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and and Powerless and see that's Satan's whole desire is that to get into the message churches today and make them formal lukewarm and have no power to live a righteous Life to Live above sin Don't Preach on a motion or you can't have emotion because that's power you can't have this you can't have that and you got to you just got to receive it just as it comes we got the word now the revealed word that's Sor you got to just nod your head to it don't say Amen cuz that makes too much of a Ruckus but I heard today brother Brown said everywhere Jesus went there was a lot of Racket that's right put yourself in blind bought a M's shoes you would be calling on him too you'd be calling on God you said by your stri time he'll finish it now but he says notice now he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the true spirits of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit so we find that Satan has injected himself through co- formal theology that's right co- formal theology got him into the human race his purpose is destroy the sea line of God to have preeminence in the church to be worshiped as God sitting in the temple of God so Satan's purpose brother BR says from Eden was to make himself an Eden and exalt himself above so that the stars of God will worship Him Sons would worship Him and he absolutely had carried it out now now if Satan has brought his Eden to its Perfection what about God God ain't promising another Eden here but he's promised perfection in the Eden what is that Perfection it's a body it's a bride and she is going to be bone of his bone life of his life so Satan's purpose was to seduce and deceive the elect seed of God to work worship him in his Eden by his man-made religion which mirr is true worship but lacks the power to live a Victorious Life it's a religion built on education intellectual understanding and not a revelation but God's purpose is to preserve and to and protect that elect sea to Rapture and catch away the elect from out of Satan's a that's so we go on to find here brother Brown would tell us in the pergan church age he said in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone she will be a super church this is what he's talking about you tonight he will she will be a super Church a super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God and he he says from this little group of true seed of the word God will present Christ with the Beloved bride she is Virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man's Creeds or dogmas but by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be manifested in a virgin and he would tell us I no longer call you church but I call you bride notice that was a name not that a prophet put on you but God put on you God was showing a distinction that's right you're not part of this I've separated you from this I'm calling you bride I'm calling you separated see you're a different race you're you're a super race you're a super church he said it was anointed man then but now it's the anointed people why aned by what by by accepting what Eve turned down Adam and Eve coming back with the anointing of the word he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept what do she turned down she turned down an opportunity at life that's right but today he's come back in this hour yes and now there's a bride that's not going to fall there's a bride that's not going to turn them down but she's going to accept his message she's going to accept his life she's going to accept his seed right so insteading instead of refusing this we accept it he says oh Satan he goes oh you know but she turned around and listened to him but Eve but the Eve in this last day is not going to do it oh come on evening light bride around the world the even this last day oh she's not going to do it she can't fall like that first bride fell she's predestinated not to fall oh Church you can't lose tonight God's going to f finish it because he predestinated you to this moment he said God's going to do it he knows he'll have it he said he'll have a church without spot wrinkle or blemish oh Hallelujah and he says now he said he the bridegroom took away your shame put it in the sea of forgivness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life he said that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has walked was you by the washing of the water you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now you are standing as if you're standing on God's word and with God word every man every jot every title where you're standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from the Shucks and get out there into the wheat where you can rip with the sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete I said you're standing complete you're standing finished oh don't justify like you never did it in the first place somebody should say Amen to that when you look back over your life and all you see is scarve and sin and shame but God said you've never done it in the first place I said Oh Glory to God tonight if you was where I was and you was going to that Sinner's grave where I was headed oh God rich and mercy tonight said Jo I'm going to finish this you were in my thoughts and now you stand perfect now you stand complete now you stand finished I said oh blessed be the name of the Lord I got a reason to worship I got a right to praise God he done this work he started it and he's finishing it he said you are somebody needs this tonight you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the living godo I think I'll read that again again say it again cuz somebody needs it I said you are come on somebody just give a witness tonight you are The Virtuous the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned Glory he said well brother Joe I live the workst life you all sin is equal sin some of you may have never sin the sin that I sin but you still needed God you still needed a savior you still need a redeemer you still need a Healer you still need a deliverer I said oh God rich and mercy I never did it in the first place he said you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it that's rightall God don't even know know it ah it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God those thoughts here they are again he that began that work will perform it you never did it you never did it Satan's in your ear Whispering oh you did this and oh you did that somebody needs to quote this quote back to him but I never did it but I never did it I never did it what are you talking about I seen you I saw you I caught you NE oh Satan you may saw me here but in the beginning oh in the thoughts of God I never did that that wasn't me and it's a new man now I don't live by those same rules I don't live by those same mistakes I've been born again and now I'm matching the very thoughts of almighty God what God thought of me I'm here today to finish [Applause] it oh Hallelujah he said your first wedding was a no you never done it in the first place that's right oh Hallelujah the end time message is to get a bride ready and prepare for the Rapture he said according to Malachi for to bring back the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to bring them back to the faith of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore I will f finish sayith the Lord that's right he said and Jesus is so close to coming to the earth now to the power or until his power has begin to catch the people and winding them up getting them ready for the bride getting ready to be caught up in the Rapture of church that'll just fit just exactly to be taken up through its power will draw the rest of them that's born again out of the earth Jesus coming this word is bringing such a move on your heart such a move within the body of Christ that's going to Surge in one day that desire that longing that love that we have for this word and for God and for this message is going to catch us all up and that power is going to lift those out of the Grave we're all going to rise up Church oh we've already been seen in the preview we've already been seen in the vision can I go through that with you just as we begin to close right now he said oh I had a dream there a little he goes I had a dream or a vision last week when the bride came into preview of it there came up I know you spoke on this just the other day but I'm going to go back through it just because it it struck my heart he said and there came up a little bride lovely in the vision W come on Church he's talking about you but brother Joe I got wrinkles I got issues I got mistakes I got depression I got fear I got anxiety I got a vision I got the vision of you you don't don't look like you're depressed you don't look like you're full of anxiety no medication you look like that pure sinless virtuous bride quit looking in the mirror at your calamities and look at the vision what the vision has spoke of you he says I Heard a Voice by the side of me said here is a preview of the bride and she came by and I noticed her the way she was I want you to listen because this is way you are she was very lovely oh Hallelujah somebody say Amen to that am she was very lovely she was pretty young yeah Hallelujah come on old people should have danced on that one yeah she was just she was walking just to the step as she could not a March just in a stride of a woman how walking gracefully very llike oh come on come you got this picture just just in your mind right now man carrying herself like a lady not some Harlot not some prostitute but a lady the way the lady should conduct herself and carry herself that's the way she was walking coming into my left or coming to my left on this side and she went out on my right and I look coming to me and I seen why the most pretty bunch of clean dressed women that I ever seen in my life but each of them they looked like they were dressed different they all had long hair they were and were wearing long sleeves and skirts and so forth young women and they look kind and I'd say maybe about 20 and she was the cleanest now I'm pulling this from several different places when he speaks about the bride in the preview here he says she was the cleanest sweetest looking people that I've ever seen in my life she passed by sweetly with an air you know how it is you've seen that lady that's you know Sister Karen was one of those ladies when she walked by she just had an air about her that she was a god Godly example of ladyhood of Christianity she was what God emulated and put here to be an example some of you ladies even here tonight some of you older sisters that are you've been examples for years you walk sweetly with an air you ain't got them more High skirts up trying to be 20 years old again no you recognize I'm a lady I'm a sister you carry yourself with an air of respect decency morality he say she she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I've ever seen passed by sweetly with an air her eyes up watching as she passed by she was watching she ain't got her head all down all concerned about what's going on around her but she was watching watching what watching the prophet watching his eyes notice what he says here she was beautiful and I looked at her and she passed by and said that's the briide woo Hallelujah but he said now we're going to review the churches said that's the Bible now we're going to review the churches look like it got worse I've seen them such filthy bunch in my life or goes I've never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and I heard a noise next and it was here comes the American group and he showed me each church as they come up out of the ages oh my how vulgar and the last one was just the last day Church which was led by a witch they were so immorally dressed so filthy looking and they were marching to the time of twist and rock and roll and those women throwing themselves just in the twist withholding just a paper gray hypocritical worship a gray paper looking paper holding in front of them with the lace like a hoola skirt holding in the front and completely new from the waist up and was marching to the time of twisting and carrying on with the music walking up and I said is that is the church each one of them had their haircut real short frizzy looking things haul over like that real shortcut hair full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and he said and is that the church he goes when it passed by me my heart like to fainted and I thought if that's what I'm trying to be or if that's what is trying to be presented to Christ as a bride oh all the efforts and things that man has put forth to try to bring forth a bride for Christ and vulgar and dirty and filthy looking prostitute like that to be the bride of Christ it made me sick to my heart she passed by in the whole back part there was no covering and she passed by and he said I fell faint and sickly see Church it all seemed but lost through all the efforts of theologians all we could produce is a filthy church one that would dress immoral one that would be nbed from her waste up one that would come walking in and her church services would be full of twist and rock and roll women throwing themselves completely new from the waist up and no covering on the back part and now you have these these tights that they wear all over the place even to the house of God that's nothing but nudity see it seemed that Satan had won there was no power in the church to live a Victorious Life no strength to live above sin and Satan's vices and his cold form of powerless religion his plan of perversion to deceive The Godly seed prevailed so it it appeared but we find in Matthew 242 24 it says that it would decede the very elect if it was possible oh but it's impossible to deceive the elect he said the church positioned before the foundation world when when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing her forth knowing what she would do he positionally placed her in his own body to be a housewife to be a former to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this to be that he placed you positionally he says now then God having predestinated the church he said all the peoples there was million times millions that walked very religious and they were deceived only the ones that will not be deceived will be the ones that come over into the promised land just as we heard Sunday those that have crossed over into that promised land they won't be deceived why church because they've already crossed over they left Cades Baria they quit going around and around and around the mountain they have crossed into the supernatural they have crossed into the Born Again experience with the baptism of the Holy Ghost let me tell you you get that in your heart you'll never be deceived you won't be that church going down in destruction but you'll be that church that God sees in AB Vision he said false Christ will rise in the last days will de seeed the very elect if it was possible but it's not possible he said no sir the elect was for ordained so he he said they will not be deceived the bride will come into preview again oh brother Derek it looked like it was lost it looked like every effort that man had done to put God a church on the scene oh she went down in destruction but God said oh that that bride not the church but the bride is going to come back in preview oh God is determined brother Tim to finish it what she was at the beginning is why she's going to be in the end time the bride will come into preview again and here the bride came behind her the very same looking bride that passed by at the beginning oh my heart jumped for joy and they don't want us to get excited oh they don't want us to get emotional no sir I see myself in the vision I'm not that one going down in destruction oh but here I come again and what she was in the Ephesian age is is what she is in the L of C woo same air of ladyhood beautiful long sleeves long skirts long hair modest notice what he says now the very same looking bride that passed by at the beginning then my heart jumped for joy to know that there will be a bride she will be made the same thing clothed in the same thing the one that was at the beginning she is to be called he goes now he says I know that to be the truth if this isn't the truth then every Vision that I've had he goes in the back has been wrong and anyone knows that not one thing as I've ever told you but what was been the truth it came to pass and he's telling you this is the truth the bride is in preview again the bride passed by in the same position that she was in in the beginning he said all the others went off in that chaos they left they disappeared here still beating to the music making real funny sounds shaking their bodies one side to the other oh but wait the bride must come again I said Oh Glory to God brother the bride is here she's here today Church the wait is over the bride is on the scene the manifestation of the sons of God we are here we have crossed over into the promised land and what she was in that day she is again the same in this day he will finish it he will finish finish it she's perfectly the second time like she was the first time musicians please come oh but the bride came back because she was Alpha and Omega God the great sculpture had made him a masterpiece for it his piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden took a piece from and made another piece and that marred and failed and now he's been all time building it up again and he brought forth this master Masterpiece and was smitten in order that the part was smitten was in order to bring back again the Masterpiece again so the Masterpiece of the Son of God the Masterpiece and the bride is peace of him which must be the fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready for the coming of the Lord he said the Masterpiece fell at Pentecost n a Rome she come through the process but she is coming right back again to that Masterpiece perfected cuz she's part of the word which was spoken by him he will have a church without spot without wrinkle without blemish that's the reason the bride came in preview the second time there has to be a church called out of the Latter day like there was in the first day just exactly the tree come from its roots up to the bride tree like it did

word you've given us Lord through a prophetic message Lord not my message but the message you sent through a prophet a Vindicated mouthpiece for this hour Lord declaring that you showed a distinction between the church and the bride and Lord and we can see that what man has produced has produced a church that is out of rhythm with everything that this Bible stands for but there is a bride Lord and she's a match piece to you same character same life same Zeal Same Love Bone of your bone flesh of your flesh and Lord you showed her to a prophet in a vision you gave him an example of what that first church or that first bride looked like that one that was first planted in the Ephesian age and you knew there would be there would be other ages Lord and that church would go down in destruction go down through the Dark Ages but she'd begin to rise again Lord because you was always working on that Masterpiece and what father Satan has had his intellectual denominational bride working on her Lord bringing her here into this age but father we find at that age that bride goes down in destruction but this one here what she was in the beginning is what she is now God what a promise of finishing you show us through the message God you show us through the scriptures it's always been about you and a bride and we got down to the end of the age Lord through a prophet's message and again you're showing us the bride father help us to see who we are not our failures not our defeats not our difficulties not our our loneliness not our complex and our fears and depression but God help us to see exactly who we are we are that sinless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ never done it in the first place Lord I ask that you bless your people tonight Lord I pray you would be with them go with
