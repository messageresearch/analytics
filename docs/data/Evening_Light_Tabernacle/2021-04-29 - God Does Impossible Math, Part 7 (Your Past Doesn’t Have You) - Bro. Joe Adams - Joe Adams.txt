the author and the finisher of our faith the one who formed the world's lord you're the one who formed and fashioned us dear god and tonight we can truly say we've been changed not by anything that we merited on our own abilities and human efforts but because lord we stepped into your presence and your presence changed us lord we're not what we used to be lord we're maybe not what we desire to be but father it's you continually working on the behalf of the believer lord to bring him into the state in the place in which you desire us to be father so we thank you tonight lord we just pray that you'll bless this service we ask god that you'll just have free course in our way tonight lord we just worship you in spirit and in truth we invite you lord tonight in this service to be the guest minister father lord we're not here to look in on the efforts of a man but we're here to look to the son of man now may you speak boldly to us father and on our ears not in our hearts lord and anoint us just to be able to receive from the word tonight for we ask it in jesus name amen and amen if you have your bibles we're going to look here in luke chapter 8 and verse 1. it's good to be back with you we were joseph and i went on a little if you want to call a little mini vacation we met brother andrew glover in missouri and tip and enjoying each other's company and doing a little turkey hunting while we were there it was a good time but it's always good to be back home with god's people good to be back home with those that love you and i trust tonight that that you love me because i love you as well and glad to be a part of this assembly to be a part of what god is doing here leave me like tabernacle so we're going to look here tonight and we're going to pick back up on the theme that i've been on god does impossible math and as we saw god move on behalf of our activity building god doing the impossible brother daryl can tell you a little bit more about the situation but god definitely moved on behalf of that that uh fire marshal and changed his countenance and his disposition toward us and our church and we found favor because we're favored by god and everything that we say and do i believe that we should look for the favor of god and god has uh turned his attention toward us we look here tonight in luke 8 and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every every city and village preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve were with him and a certain woman which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils you can have your seats tonight we're gonna look here at another scripture here in just a few minutes but we see here that jesus is going out preaching the good news the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve disciples were with him and one called mary whom he cast out seven devils now if we would have lived in that day the day of mary magdalene we would have considered her a lost cause a hopeless case no doubt she'd have looked at herself and said i'm a prostitute i'm a woman of ill fame it's impossible for me to be delivered you know i looked over my life and i'm just a useless piece of humanity to this society i contribute nothing but what we find is what may be impossible with man is never impossible with god you can look upon the countenance of man the most degraded man out there as we find in legion and the maniac of godaria we find these men we would have never gave two ounces or two seconds of attention but yet god will cross a raging sea because he sees something that you and i can't see so we find what's impossible when man is not impossible with god so tonight we're going to speak again on god does impossible math and your past doesn't have you your past doesn't have you we finally hear in second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away i believe every believer in here tonight should rejoice on that all things all the old things are passed away that's not who i am anymore behold all things have become new or are become new and all things are of god who has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given us given to us the ministry of reconciliation but we find mary was or mary was from the city of magdala and this city was known for prostitution so she was already marred because of where she was located and anywhere she went the stigma of prostitution of ill fame went with her so no matter what her past went with her every day that she lived it was always followed her but the prophet god would tell us in the message unwelcome christ remember somebody introduced her to that life before there can be a foul woman that has to be a foul man that's right maybe some boy fell in love with her be careful young girl some whirly boy wants to come and sweep you off your feet and tell you all these nice things about you and he's got a motive he's got an objective because he's unconverted and he sees something in you with that surprise in his eyes and this same young boy saw mary before she was tainted by the relationship and he maybe had her fall in love with him and he enticed her and brother brennan would say he made her promises and he ruined her life and he introduced her to such and then pushed her off to one side to run off to some other woman he said some sweetheart introduced us such a life put her in his arms and he promised her everything no you promised her i'm going to love you i'm going to be faithful if you just do this act and prove to me that you love me because that's a lot of times how that relationship goes if you really loved me you would do this if you really loved me you would kiss me or you really loved me you would go further and go further and go it never stops until she becomes a woman of ill fame until she mars her testimony until the prophet of god will say her character is ruined and he runs away to spoil another and now she's roaming the streets making money the best way that she can see like the prodigal son instead of running back to the father's house she runs further into the country she goes further off into sin to her now her life her livelihood is prostitution this one act between her and this sweetheart opened the door to a lifestyle of prostitution opened her up to spirits for not only one spirit that she had but she was bound by seven evil spirits but this same woman we find her in john 8 in verse 3 and the scribes and the pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery now the historians will tie mary magdalene to this same chapter into the same scripture and say that mary magdalene is this woman here and she was caught in the very act of adultery and when they had saturn in the midst they say until master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now moses in the law he commanded us that such should be certain notice their first instinct was to stone her and you find many times that those that have things in their life those that have sin in their life they carry stones in their pockets because if they can throw stones and it takes the attention off of their flaws and their character traits but you find those that don't have any stones and they've been recipients of god's grace and god's mercy they're not their casting stones but they're there pronouncing mercy and grace to them there's a way you don't have to live that way anymore there's a god in heaven he can save you and deliver you but you find those that have things in their heart and things in their life they're costly throwing stones at those that are bound by sin just to deflect to deflect it from their self he says now moses in the law commanders so shall be stoned but what saith thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger he wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and he said unto them he that is without sin among you let him cast the first stone and again he stooped down he wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscious notice they knew that they had sin in their life they knew that they were not perfect and if we come to this church every day and we wake up every morning and realize we're not perfect we need the blood we need the blood each and every day we need a token we need god each and every day we won't be picking up stones to throw in our neighbor to throw at our brother to throw at some other church no we'll be picking up grace and mercy and saying god have mercy on them god open their eyes let them see what we see let them experience what we experienced and when jesus looked it up himself he saw none but the moment in verse 10 and he says unto her woman where are those dying accusers has no man condemned thee she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more now trust many of you here tonight have heard those same words because as much as you think you're saintly and godly and you cut your teeth on a message pew yet you were born in sin shaped in iniquity you needed this same jesus you needed the same encounter neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more notice this encounter with jesus began to change her life he began her on the road to a new life before this meeting she probably went to every synagogue looking for help for the cure looking for somebody that can deliver her and cast these seven devils off of her looking for some way of an escape to rehab her life so that she wouldn't continue the life of prostitution and bound by this and bound by that she was longing for deliverance but she couldn't find it until she came to the feet of jesus because he's the only one church you're not going to find it in a man you're not going to find it in your favorite preacher but you'll find it in christ you'll find what you're looking for in christ and i say that to say take your eyes off a man take your eyes off of humanity because man will fail you but christ will never fail you man will disappoint you but the blood will never disappoint you she stood here and where she once heard about his love where she was told about his grace and mercy now this jesus the messiah had extended to her his love now he has extended to her his grace and his mercy now she was a recipient she become a recipient of life-changing power where she walked in his presence a bound prostitute she walked in maybe bound by demons of lust and depression and suicide and this that and she walked in one way but she walked out another way and the difference was jesus christ the difference was the encounter that she had was the one that can erase her past and i trust tonight that you've come into that same encounter where you met jesus you didn't meet a man you didn't mean a theology you didn't mean a doctrine but you met the life of christ and that life changed who you are we find her again in luke 7. and i love how the scriptures how it puts it all in past tense not future tense not present tense past tense we find here in luke 7 and verse 37 and behold a woman in the city which was nadia's she was a prostitute or a sinner that word center there means prostitute when she knew that jesus said at meeting the pharisee's house she went on home she didn't think about it anymore she felt like well he's in good hands he's eating a nice meal he's in good company i'm just going to go chill out at the house no when she knew that he was there she brought an alabaster box of ointment and she stood at his feet behind him weeping because she realized the person that she was she realized the spirits that once held her bound and she was weeping because now she was no longer bound by those things and she began to wash his feet with her tears and she did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed him and kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment notice here she stands a ruined life here she stands every day she was bound by depression and oppression fear gripped her life she felt like she had her life had no value at all to society every day thoughts of suicide race through her mind i might as well give up i might as well end it because this is all i'll ever be but god sees more in you than what you see in yourself you wake up in the morning you look in that mirror and you see your flaws you see your past you see your mistakes but god sees his perfection god sees that image that he took of you before the foundation of the world and he says i'm going to allow this to happen and this to happen and to chip away at this and to chip away at that to mold you to do what to produce the negative so that it'll develop you into what he's already seen you to be so we find here in verse 39 7 39 now when the pharisee which had bidding him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what man or woman this is that touched him for she's a sinner and jesus answered and said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he said master say on he said there was a certain creditor which had two debtors one owed them 500 pence and the other owed them 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which one of them would love him the most i'm afraid that we have a lot of 50 50s in this message we have a lot of 50s they don't think that he's worth worshipping they're not in love with him enough to truly give all their worship then you have some in this message that are 500 and they don't care what you think about them because they were forgiven the most and i trusted even like tabernacle never never harbors the 50s never let it come complacent never let the movement of the spirit die never sit back on our law sit on our hands and quench the spirit but may we open ourselves up and realize we have so much to be thankful for he's forgiven us of so much simon answered and said i suppose to him that forgave the most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and he said unto simon seeth thou this woman i had entered into thy house thou gave us me no water from my feet but she has washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with her head thou gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time that i came has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with all this thou not anoint but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he looks at her and he says to her thy sins are forgiven so we found the eastern custom was the foot washing it was an act of hospitality and yet simon invited jesus into his home and he didn't even make him welcome brother mike the kiss was a token of affection and salutation simon invited him into his home and neglected to kiss him on his cheek but this woman bowed herself in humility and cease not to kiss his feet we find that he didn't even know on his head with oil and yet she went and got a costly bottle of perfume where once she would put it on her body to make herself attractive and luring to other men now she was pouring it out on his feet to give him the attention give him the attraction to anoint him so that he's the one that's received and not herself brother branham would tell us like this and washing jesus feet she looked like she was out of her head you know we've had some church services where it looks like even light has fallen off the rocker you got young people up laughing in the spirit running the aisles and old people running well some of them running the aisles and you got people shouting all over the place you got the moving on it looks like we're completely lost that we're out of our heads but brother baby say she was at the feet of jesus and when you recognize who comes to this service wednesdays and sunday service after service oh and you realize you got an opportunity to be at his feet you've got an opportunity to worship the king of kings and the lord of lords let me tell you you'll put your stones away and you'll come up and say lord i'm here in this service i'm going to push through in this service i want to get to you in this earth and i'm going to wash your feet lord i want to kiss you lord and make love to you in the sanctuary because you've done so much for me father notice people may act like they're crazy but what difference does it make as long as you're at the feet of jesus what do i care what they think she was at jesus's feet but this pharisee was ready to blow up now here he was he was a critic he was beside himself because of what she was doing and how she was acting what is this prostitute doing in my house first of all why in the world she bowed down to this man who they're claiming he's the messiah and look at her washing his feet with her tears and wiping them with her hair how disgusting doesn't she know she's going to have all the filth of the world all tangled up in her hair she didn't care church and until we get to that place where we don't care what the critics say we don't care what the critics claim they can claim what they won't notice see the problem today is there's so many critics and they criticize the movement of the spirit they feel that we shouldn't act this way in church simon felt like she didn't need to act that way in his church but she did it anyway because she recognized the one that freed her from seven spirits the one that changed her life from a life of prostitution and made a daughter a god out of her he was out there pushed in the corner wasn't made welcome and she came to the surface she came to church that day to the feast and says i'm here to make love to you lord i'm here to make you welcome in this service on a wednesday night when there ain't nobody there i'm here i came tonight to love your god and to make you welcome i'm here to give you praise tonight i'm going to worship the king of kings the one that i walked in one way down and i walked out another way a free woman oh hallelujah see we find people today though they want to say well even like tabernacle you shouldn't act that way my generation didn't act like that i got a news flash dead dead generation is dead but this generation has got life this generation is flexible this generation can move with the movement of the spirit of god see the pharisee he criticized a woman and he criticized jesus but he didn't realize that he was presented with the same opportunity to do what she was doing he was presented he invited him to his house he had an opportunity brother mike to surrender his heart to give up his clerical ideas and theology the one that he had studied and learned about all these years was now standing face to face but he was pushed over in a corner may we never be guilty of pushing jesus in a corner and letting somebody else worship letting somebody else carry the burden to worship of him and making him welcome like simon let her do all the work see in his mind he was too big for that in his mind he thought he was somebody he was too prideful to wash jesus's feet he was too proper to come to an altar on a wednesday night because he's worried about what is everybody else going to think about see the difference was that this pharisee was not married he hasn't been bound the way that she had been bowed she was bound with seven devils she was bound with a life of prostitution and she was longing for deliverance she knew that she was a vile person and he didn't realize he was as well see the pharisee didn't realize that he was worse off than her therefore he criticized her for her actions and we have been criticized and criticized and criticized for our worship i believe it was paul to say the way that they call heresy so worship i the lord amen the way that they call let them call it whatever they want they're only looking in through the eyes of a camera we're here feeling the power in the anointing of the holy spirit moving through the building if you can feel on the camera what we feel in here you wouldn't be saying the things that you're saying because you would begin to experience the life the power the manifestation of the holy spirit but as long as you're hit behind the eyes of the camera and on the live stream all you see is a bunch of emotion or what appears to be a bunch of emotion and yes it's easy to criticize but see maybe some of those out there that want to do the criticizing they've not been where you and i have been some of those may not had a death sentence pronounced on them and may be given just a few years to live because they got stage four non-hodgkin's lymphoma and have a family to look after oh but when the power of god drops down in the service and that revelation strikes that heart that i don't have cancer any longer that i've been set free it'll take a young lady up out of her chair out of repute and run around the church why because the revelation has struck let me tell you you wouldn't criticize if you was in those shoes you wouldn't criticize if you had another brain bleed or midline shift and the doctors gave you five minutes and you experience the healing power of almighty god you ain't criticized anymore you'll worship god and thank god for what he's done maybe you maybe if you would ever been delivered of that suicidal spirit that's tormented into many of them messes believers torment to many of our young people and when those spirits are cast off and as we seen the other night the heart of god began to dance and sin in the spirit of god because while the chains that held her bound were no longer elder anymore the past that held her in bondage no longer had a hold anymore let me tell you we have a reason to worship we find now jesus got his feet and she's at his feet he didn't pull back the prophet god says he didn't pull his feet back as hell don't do that don't cause a scene on a wednesday night no he sat there and he watched her he allowed this dirty woman a real fame to touch him to worship him to make love to him and don't think that as a negative at all but if he was the been where she was at he'd be offering that same kind of love tonight he'd be offered that same kind of sacrifice of praise tonight see jesus don't he doesn't pull back he doesn't do things that way no sir he never pulled his foot back he sat right still and he washed her notice what the prophet of god says she was doing for him what they ought to have done she was doing for him what they ought to have done then he begins to say sin and you be careful calling somebody a holy roller who's doing what you ought to have done don't you think you're a little better than they are let me just go ahead and give the critics notice don't you be careful who you're calling holy rollers because what we're doing and even like tabernacle is what you should be doing in your church it's what you should be doing in your home it's what you should be doing in your experience with jesus is to worship him he deserves our worship but all we do is we're throwing stones and criticizing because there ain't no life in your church we'll invite jesus and make him welcome and you'll see life come back to the assembly he says that these big starches won't worship god god will pull out you poor people he will get you to do it somebody he will call sinners and harlots from the street to do it somebody is going to worship god i raise my hand tonight lord i'm that somebody god i don't care what the critics say let them say what they want to joe adam this is a fanatic absolutely a fanatic i used to dance in the comfort for the devil i'll dance in the church for jesus i don't care what you say about me i don't care what it looks like i may be out of my head i may lost my mind but i got the mind of jesus i got the love of jesus i know what he's done for me brother andrew glover shared this quote from me on the way to church tonight he says brother joe i think you need this i said i'll look it over i text him back after it i said i'm going to use it he says what we need is to get down to that grinding place down there in the valley and dig out how much gotta do a little bit of work when where is he not well maybe they ain't all full and packed out we do a little digging tonight can't we brother aaron dig down a little bit let's let's get the comwells off of us tonight we're here to worship see it's where the church needs to be tonight he says now i can imagine they were noticing the green light beginning you know you say green he said yeah he goes we might be green but we got life anyhow see they don't think brother branham was pentecostal they think he was some stiff neck starchy preacher no they don't know the same prophet that i know he says i was in a school not long ago my son told some students that he was from southwestern bible school myself and they said well if you can read and write you're better off than that bunch over there i said well he says they're the greenest bunch we've ever seen brother man says oh brother we might be green but we're flexible oh i don't know if even like caught that one we might be green but we're flexible anything that isn't green when you pull a little bit you'll break it he says oh that's what's the matter today with too many people's experiences too dry and too stiff we need something flexible so when the wind comes down and it can blow it and rush around and pull it around and make it grow get life in it i'd rather be green a little green and to be flexible to the holy ghost so i can give instead of standing and making unmournful noise it's like a funeral service the days of miracles has passed god don't do that anymore in my generation we didn't act like that i think you should just be calm and you know you need to have some church order even like tabernacle okay we got it we're green we're flexible we don't quench the spirit he said them young trees though when their flesh one can give to the spirit and the spirit begin to move them like a rushing wind filling them full of god's goodness that's the kind of life it may be a green bunch oh yes it's a bunch that's got life in it and anything that hasn't got life in it is dead and if your experiences are dead tonight you need to bury the thing and won't you come up here and i'll introduce you to the green light i'll introduce you to the one that's got life in him he's here he comes service after service he's here to move upon the spirit let me tell you the problem that god will say you give me one or two young people on fire for god he'll do more for a church than 40 revivals give me somebody tonight that's ready to worship give me somebody tonight that realized i had a past but my past don't have me i used to be bound but i found no more i've been set free i've been released by the bondage right from the bottom and now i can serve god now i can worship god i got a reason to praise him i got a reason to worship him tell me what you want to call me he's called me son he's called me daughter he's caught me saved he caught me filled with the holy ghost he called me and that's all that matters he called me i don't care what the critics say he turns to simon simon you invited me but you didn't make me welcome my feet needed to be washed but you didn't even offer my head should have been anointed but you didn't even offer he wouldn't even give me a kiss to make me welcome but her sins her past her sins that are many are now forgiven see mary had a pass but her past didn't have her because she came in the presence of the one that can release her from the bondage of sin and free her from those tormented spirits and you tonight you may have a path but your past doesn't have to have you your past doesn't have young people you may have done things that you hadn't been happy about let's put it like this older people you may have done things that you're sad and they torment you day after day and you wake up every morning and the first thing that rushes to your mind is the act that you did but i want you to know because you got a path doesn't mean that your path has to live with you it doesn't have to have that grip on your life anymore but i'm here to tell you jesus is here and he's here so somebody can worship him somebody can wash his feet somebody can make love to him tonight but he's the one that can break the yoke off of your life and free you from your past and set you on your course for a new day a new beginning how many you gotta pass you gotta pass but you're here tonight because your past doesn't have you you've done things that you're not happy about you said things that you're not happy about there's actions in your life that the devil tries to remind you of but it doesn't have you because you're here tonight it shows that you're here tonight and if you're still struggling with that oh may this just resonate in your heart you don't have to be bound any longer because i want to liberate he's here tonight he's here to loose you from your sins he's going to loose you from your path he's here to free you from your mistake he's here tonight to heal to deliver to set free he's here not joe adams but the almighty god the angel of the lord is here tonight to do exactly what he declares before her salvation and her liberty men would look at her i said i'm not going to pay that much for her look at her she has no value she's a prostitute down but doesn't see her past may have devalued her work to man but it didn't devalue her work to god jesus took this dirty woman of hill fame scarred with sin ruined her life she was seeking true love and acceptance and he made a daughter of god out of here you would look at him and say i'm not willing to pay that because you're looking through the eyes of man but jesus looks to a different set of eyes he looks through the eyes of prophecy and says i've already had you somewhere i've already seen you somewhere and he says every prophet he ever sent he sent it for you every every word inscribed on the pages of this bible he did it for you tonight every beating that he took to cut a nine tails a crown of thorns that was placed on his head the excruciating headache for hours the spit the ridicule the shame the cross the nails in his hands and his feet the spirit inside he thought you were worth it therefore he took it on upon himself notice he conquered death because you were worth it he conquered the grave because you was worth it he conquered hell because you were worth it he rose on the third day because you were worth it i should give us a reason tonight don't look at your path your past is in the past jesus christ thought so much about you that you may not have no human value but to god you mean the world to them [Applause] brother brown was in a museum in tennessee and they were doing an analysis of the human body i know some of us think we're better than others we put a 800 suit on a 84 cent body and i understand some of us got more body than others but all in all it's 84 cents he brother bam heard over two men over talking so my man we're not very much army george we ain't birth very much before the battle couldn't hold itself he turned around he said oh boy you may not be very much worth very much but your soul is worth 10 million worlds see don't let the devil try to tell you you're not worth anything don't let the devil tell you you're not valued he's constantly digging up your path he said look what you did look what you've done he's the accuser of the brother but the accuser's been cast down and i'm gonna tell you about a jesus who's the liberator jesus who can break the yoke off of your life jesus who can turn a dirty sinful person into a saintly son and daughter of god see if any man is in christ he's a new creature new desires old things are passed away and all things have become new everybody that ever has been free from the devil by the power of jesus knows where they're standing no one can ever come in his divine presence and ever be the same person anymore he says you're changed and if you're not changed tonight is because you've not allowed yourself to come in that presence step back and you fold your arms while everybody else is washing feet everybody else is kissing everybody else is anointing everybody else is worshiping and you sit back there unconcerned all right simon criticized got your stones out ready to chunk them at somebody well look what they just did it was on that website last week that was last week's news you don't know what happened between this week and last week you don't know that encounter when she met jesus you don't know that encounter where they really surrendered all to god's god i'm not gonna go to that website anymore i'm giving you my heart it may not happen in front of all the world on a wednesday night or a sunday morning it could have been on a tuesday night it could have been on a friday night it could have been a thursday morning how do we know we don't know but i'm here to tell you he comes where he's invited see she had seven devils cast out of her pride envy she thought she was so pretty and there was no one like her i'm afraid we got some of that in the message as well we got some young ladies today they want to dress down you know what you can't determine you can't do differentiate them from a worldly lady or a whirly girl i ain't going to say lady because the lady's going to dress herself in godly apparel and conduct herself in the right manner but we got those around the messes just because you claim that you believe god sent a prophet doesn't make you a believer let me go ahead and put you on notice tonight but we find she thought she was better she thought she was somebody but when jesus spoke to her said be thou clean all of that left all of the desires that she used to have to put on the makeup it began to leave her she no longer had that desire anymore she no longer cut her hair anymore and dressed in a provocative way to draw the attention of man to her she no longer was concerned about attracting the attention of man now she was concerned about attracting the detention of almighty god what will it take how does he want me to trespass how does he want me to look how does he want me that how do i know how he wants me to be oh my she was now free and the things that she used to do the lifestyle that she used to desire she doesn't do them anymore she doesn't desire them anymore but she goes to this party notice now as i continue to go on give me just a few more minutes it's getting late she's had a lot of wrestling match going on in her mind she knows there's a party she knows that jesus is in attendance and she knows he's pushed to the corner nobody is worshiping him nobody is acknowledging him it's getting late it's about the evening time see she's late the party's already started but it's better late than never you waited a long time but it's better to come and some of you tonight even here at even like tabernacle you waited alone there's a pool in your heart to serve god there's a pull in your heart to surrender all but there's something hanging on you called your path that doesn't want to release you into that power into that presence see you waited a long time she waited a long time the prophet of god would say don't you stay where you are how long time you've been wanting to really be a christian you've waited a long time it's getting pretty pretty late he says now but go anyhow let this time let this morning be the morning i'm going all the way with christ i gotta get there i say let weasley night on the wednesday night let this be your night let this be your time that you come and you surrender all and worship the almighty god it's time we stop pulling back when the spirit of god begins to fall and come down but the devil's there to say you know what hey stay in your seat stay right there we don't want them to know you got something in your life oh you'll be embarrassed you don't need to tell that preacher what you've been doing he'll tell everybody but you desire to be free mary magdalene desire since that first instance with that young boy to find freedom to clean her life back up she was raised in a christian home her brother was lazarus and her sister was martha she knew about the power of god they knew about the messiah he's coming even like he's here we're not waiting on his coming he's here he's been here you waited a long time you desire to be free you want to be a real christian let me declare he's here he's here tonight to free you from your past he's here to give you a new future he's here to deliver you he's here to heal you he's here to break the yoke of bondage off of your life isaiah 10 and verse 27 says he shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off the shoulder who's burning the enemy's burden he's going to be taken off the shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing it's the anointing that breaks the yoke and if you still got the yoke of sin on you let me tell you the anointing is here service after service but you got to bring that yolk up to the altar you got to bring your life subject to the word and say i'm tired of living this way i want to serve god brother joe i want to surrender everything and it'll change your life from this day forward and you won't desire the things that you used to desire something inside with her was telling her to go in she wanted to do jesus a service but like many of us well it's what are they going to think what are they going to think i mean my goodness my dad's a deacon or my husband's a deacon or my my wife is this or we you know we start setting ourselves up on pedestals thinking nobody is in here is a center but there's three kind of believers in every service see the thing was brother brown would say was not how she was going to get there but was she going to make the effort to get there some of you came on a wednesday night tonight but are you going to get there are you going to get there are you going to get to his feet you made the effort you're in the place for you to get there where you can worship him brother brown said i could see her elbowing her way down through the crowd no matter what they said she was on her road to meet jesus do you do that no matter what they say no brother joe i quench the spirit some of us have felt the spirit of god move right across our pew we all not all but some of us and we sit there because we don't want to allow ourselves to be free to it because we may speak in tongues we may jump up and dance and we may do something else we don't know there's times that i have felt the spirit of god move and i sit there because i'm on the platform then it moves somewhere else because somebody's going to speak in tongues when it declares to be spoken somebody's going to dance in the spirit when it's there to be danced with somebody's going to give a shout when the spirit moves so we find here are we going to elbow our way through all the differences of the world can we up our way through the vulgarity all the picture shows now we find that our young people are tied to social entertainment i started telling my kids i'll tell you what for every minute you have on social media or on your ipad or your iphone i want that much time in the word either you listen to a tape or you read your bible you put an hour in over here you put an hour in where you give god equal oh it'll change their habits he don't change they realize oh i'm consuming a whole lot of social media i'm consuming a whole lot of screen time and i ain't giving god a whole lot of nothing but when you draw the line right there and say you give god the same amount you give this your father and start having a real experience and begin to push away some of the things that are attracting their attention see she was going to get there regardless of how valve she was brother bam would say i know it was out of order god help us to get out of order once in a while the trouble of it is you got too much order get out of order i hope the church gets out of order long enough to get saved now he's telling this to a pentecostal group too much order in pentecost oh my goodness don't come to the message when we so church order down it ain't funny we sing three songs at the beginning of a service two songs at the end and we're dismissing we're done we don't give the spirit of god time to do nothing if he can't happen when the preacher is preaching so what get you next time hop in the services you man you preach the house down the song leader comes up sees a couple of songs and just kills the anointing now if i could sing i wouldn't let that man have the mic buddy you can stay over there i you ain't getting it back you kill the servants i don't work too hard for this but you're fine because we're so on church order so traditional so bound to well this is the way it's always done and by the way brother joe you've been longer than 45 minutes you need to hurry up shut down well i'm sorry critic i'm not bound by your time element i'm listening and i'm leaning on the everlasting arm i'm feeling the pulsation of the spirit and i'm gonna tell you i don't have a past anymore and that path don't hold me your denominational ideas can't hold me i can't be held by broken chain i've been loosed by the liberator i've been set free and i'm here to worship god and i don't care about your time i don't care about your church order when god comes down and anoints the service that's what i'm looking for that's how i say amen to the word it please god so much to come by our way see jesus has a reputation his reputation is has been made in the presence of sinners there never was a blind man that ever into his presence but didn't walk away seeing with his side he never was a crippled man that ever came in his presence but what didn't leave dancing and rejoicing never was a sinner that truly wanted to serve god that ever came into his presence but walked down a son and daughter of god with no past no past and he's inviting you tonight to come in that presence he's inviting evening like tabernacle tonight to come in his presence let me ask you tonight i know some of us probably don't really care about our president oh sleepy joe he can't talk poor fella but if he gave you an invitation to the one of his son's wedding supper man we think we're the main cocker doodle do around here stick our head chest out i think we somebody brother mike president joe biden gave me an invitation to his son's wedding supper man we wouldn't just keep that to ourselves we'll put that on kslb or whatever news station channel 3 this channel fox news i've been invited to joe biden's house ha ha you didn't get nothing timmy maybe next time he'll think about you buddy but for me i got the invitation look at it oh joe brother phillip invited me yeah you didn't get one that's how we act a president invited me to his house we would think we're the big stuff we have arrived you would go just to see what would happen you may not agree with his political views god i hope you don't whatever like you would go because you was invited but i'm going to tell you tonight this ain't joe bond giving you an invitation this is jesus christ and he's not just giving you an invitation but he's giving you an invitation to the wedding supper he's giving you an invitation it's an eternal invitation you ain't got to worry about coming home you're gonna go and you're gonna rejoice and you're gonna worship god and you never had to leave his presence what an invitation what an opportunity and it takes place right now when you get before the feet of jesus and begin to worship him oh hallelujah well we'll be thinking why did job why did he send me an imitation look at me i'm quirky i got joe isms i'm losing my hair i'm nobody we always worry about the why don't worry he chose you he chose you brother william he chose you because he knew exactly what laid on the inside of him i used to wrestle well god why did you call me to the ministry look at me sometimes i stumble over my words i spit worse than you're forning get so excited i can't keep my train of thought i'm all over the place i'm running like a panty rooster nobody else does that and when they preaching i tried to teach failure no gift there somebody said true god forgive them but they're being honest i tried i tried to teach one time sat down was going to do a bible study on the holy ghost i preached the whole time sitting down i want to do everything i could to stand up so i shook that thing i said next time we're going to be standing up we're preaching the holy ghost we ain't teaching it you start we start realizing there's things in other people's lives that we won't and we aspire to you know i look at brother john andes and i love his optimism i love his attitude i don't have that then we start degrading our own value because we're not like somebody else god why'd you choose me because god had you before the foundation of the world that's why god chose you because you was a thought in the mind of god that's why god chose you but the bible will say and this morning the holy spirit through the word is bringing you the good news from before the foundation of the world god wrote your name on the lamb's book of life oh why do you care he wrote it there that's all that should matter to us god you chose me you must have saw something inside of me that i didn't see him myself but god i thank you tonight that you told me before the foundation you knew i would do this you knew i would have a past but nevertheless you looked beyond my path and you looked to my future and you called me by name and you called me son and you called me daughter and you called me forgiven and you called me saved and you called me filled with the holy ghost god you count on me for this moment you called me for such a time as this you're not a christian by your own desire no you're a christian by god's desire no man can come accept the father draws so you was elected by god before the foundation of the world christian you try you try to go off in the sin but god had already wrote your name down he says i'm gonna get them i'm gonna get them there's gonna come a time 12 years old i got a predestinated service for a christian peter sully oh and i'm gonna tell you when he walks into that prayer line he's gonna see the reality of god not mama's reality but his reality well some of y'all may not know is on that wednesday night that brother andrew spoke after oklahoma youth camp i pulled a little christian aside in this room over here and he said well brother jose i don't know god's real i said christian don't you want to serve the lord i hope you don't mind this i said don't you want to serve lord he said yeah but i feel the pull of the world how do i know god's real i said i tell you what i'll tell you what tonight if god comes in this service tonight and he vindicates himself and there's a powerful movement of the spirit i said you walk up to that prayer line i'm going to meet you there and i'm going to pray with you and you're going to see the reality of a living god let me tell you church god didn't disappoint that night god came and moved on the scene and not only did he move on the scene in the supernatural but he moved on a scene in a little heart christian wrote me a text the other day he said brother joe i'm working on my first sermon what do you think i said buddy you're on the right road just keep loving god keep falling in love with him let me tell you when you step into that presence if it's life-changing oh you say well he's only 12 years old he don't have much of a past he may have more of a past than you think but on what i'm here to tell you tonight it's in the sea of god forgetfulness god don't even remember your past anymore we keep bringing it up the devil keeps bringing it up but to god you ain't got a plan you got nothing but our future you've got nothing but today you've got nothing but tomorrow give god your all give god everything worship god in the spirit of holiness and righteousness and truth give god death he'll take your past away your paths don't have to hold you bound [Applause] your paths don't have to hold you the christian has not one worry in the world i'm going to say that again the christian i mean you're a christian tonight how many's got to pass the christian doesn't have one word in the world not one not one not one worry in the world they should be the most freest happiest people in all the world because there's nothing you can't lose did you hear that young person the devil's constantly reminding you of your failures because you know what some of you are in an awkward stage you're trying to find yourself you're trying to explore you're looking at things that you shouldn't be looking at doing things you shouldn't be doing and the devil is there to just ridicule kill ridicule and condemn condemn condemned and accused accused of accused but the prophet of god would say you can't lose i puts a whole another twist on getting up every day and saying god i'm here to serve you because i can't lose no matter what i face today no matter what i did yesterday i can't lose today the prophet of god will say you know what he goes i if you know positioning who you was and what you are tonight there wouldn't be one feeble person in the next five minutes right now we are the sons of god well i don't feel like it i don't care how you feel it ain't based on your feelings your feelings are lie to you but right now i'm going to tell you you are a son and daughter of god but you got to go confessing that you've been in that presence that you've been there in the supreme authority that jesus has given to every believer anything that you have a desire of tonight because you know your position my brother joe i did this but you know your position you know the one that called you and if he called you he elected you and if he elected you he's anointed you the prophet of god would say when he anointed you he positionally placed you in the body and there ain't enough devils in hell can take that place so i don't care what your past is your past has no bearing on your future mary you may have a past tonight but your past doesn't have you want the musicians come see it doesn't make any difference what your past has been when you get an invitation to come come when you get an invitation to serve and to worship and to humble yourself he says come you ready to come if you've been bad if you've been a street walker if you if you've been a gambler if you've been a drunkard if you've been a murderer no matter what you've been if god gives you an invitation and he's knocking on your heart's door he'll take care of the rest of him don't worry and say well i'm just a lukewarm church member he'll take care of that too see if you'll just heed the invitation whosoever will let him come and drink in the waters of life freely we all have a pass and tonight you can make that step in the right direction i'm not going to let my path define who i am this time forward i'm going to give god my all i'm going to worship god i want you by your heads tonight you're here tonight like many of us the devil has accused you and he's constantly reminded you of your failures constantly reminded you of your mistakes actions that you've done you wake up every morning and you feel condemned you go to bed every night and you ask yourself there's no use why do i even try i woke up every morning bound by devils living of life a prostitution one man after the other after the other after the other until she finally came into the presence of the one that can break the yoke church he's here tonight i don't know what your past has been and it really doesn't matter but i know there's one here tonight who can break that yoke you know there's things that brother joe's done in his past years ago as a young teenage boy things that i'm not proud of things that i never expressed to no one because it's not worthy to be expressed but i don't let that hinder me from worshiping god and i say that to tell you tonight we all have had a path we've all had made our failures and stumbled and come short of the glory of god but he sought thought so much to come by even like tabernacle on wednesday night to tell you i still do impossible things it may not look like you can find the victory in your life but i'm here tonight to tell you i'm the one that can bring the liberty i'm the one that can release you from your prison cell i'm the one that can change you i'm the one that can take your past and drop it in the sea of forgetfulness and i'll never remember it again see we look at our past and we ask god god what about my past what about the things i've done what about the thoughts i've had god looks at you and he says what past he says when i think about your past little bride i think about your past i think about that image i took before the foundation of the world i think about you being perfect i think about you being sinless i think about you being the virtuous son and daughter of god that's the only past he thinks about so you may have a past tonight but your past doesn't have to have you father we just commit this time to you now lord we thank you for the move another spirit lord we thank you for your words of liberation as you would come and just speak to our hearts lord have i labored and studied and prayed and asked you to move in such a way that would bring glory to your name i'm asking tonight lord that these words they would fall on fertile ground father you know each of us we've had our struggles lord whoever human in this life is full of disappointments lord and this body is unconverted and our actions sometimes lord speak of that unconversion but god we're so thankful tonight we have a savior we're thankful tonight lord we have a redeemer we have one that can release us and break the yoke of sin and unbelief and whatever it may be from off our hearts and our lives lord as you took mary from a city of prostitution he brought her into the presence of jesus not once but multiple times and lord you completely eradicated sin from her life and she began to serve you and follow you and to worship you lord and i heard a preacher say one time that mary is a type of this bride she come into his presence bound by sin and bound by unbelief found by the changes of past mistakes and failures but she didn't stay bound she was freed and when she was freed she began to worship the savior she was found faithful she was well she was on attention at the tomb that day god she was ready because she'd done so much for father may we as your church as your people tonight lord never be guilty of pushing you in a corner because of our past we asked the lord tonight that these words were just touch every heart and every life that was on the stream lord may they too just feel this same anointing that's here tonight lord it's an anointing of freedom we don't have to be bound any longer we don't have to listen to the accuser not when the jesus the lamb of god is present and he's the lamb that takes away the sin of the world and we're so thankful tonight father that you've taken away our sins we just commit this service to you now lord may you just just remain father let your spirit just begin to move over as lord as we just offer up our worship to you as we turn this service into an atmosphere of worship let your spirit just begin to move lord begin to settle on every heart begin to break that yoke upon his father
