TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just wanted to tell you a little bit before we go into the message this morning what we've been through in the last couple of weeks as you know the last two sundays i i have not been in the pulpit we um we have of course had some situations in at home where my wife had a complete a tremendous brain bleed there and was sent to the hospital into lsu where they did surgery on her um you may not know and i understand the severity of where we were but um the doctors gave us very grim news said that you know she could live five minutes or five years but she would not have any quality of life if she did and they came out and and told me just to prepare for death that that's how severe that it was even when i got the call from lsu i knew by the way that they um asked me about the surgery that they wasn't given much hope for her recovery and as you know today we're we're here on the other side of that and we can rejoice because there's no loss of limb no loss of memory that means she's complete amen we thank god for that and god has answered prayer just to kind of go back over some of these things just for a moment week before last you know brother ron spencer was here he was kind of a surprise visit um most of you didn't know about it because we kept it secret brother ron spencer is a pastor friend of ours from over in virginia and um he is a muslim friend of of mine and and someone that i love very much and he has had um stage four melanoma cancer it spread from his lungs and jumped into his brain just right after that he got it he had a first aid clear brain scan and then you know uh and i just thankful well it's not in his brain it's just in his lungs well he jumped right immediately into the lungs from the lungs into the brain but um you know he has steadfastly believed and we've been praying and believing with him and by the way brother timothy caught the wind of the spirit this morning as we as as i just had it on the tip of my tongue to tell you don't go and pray for your mom don't go and pray for brother ron you go and thank god for their healing that's what i want you to do i want you to thank god it's already done amen we're confessing it and we're believing it but he had preached at his own home church um just um a bit prior to him coming the weekend before he was coming i must get to jesus and in reference to the queen of the south uh who came to hear the wisdom of solomon he noted that you know that people would would drive 17 18 hours to get into brother branham's meetings to get in the presence of jesus and would be healed and it struck him afterwards that he must do the same and so he wanted to drive over here to louisiana and spend some time with me and for me to pray for him now of course you know i'm not a healer the lord is a healer but um it's there's gifts in the body and gifts of healing is one let me explain it like this uh just sharing this from looking under jesus and said you know what the gift of healing is faith in healing you just release your faith to pray for somebody that's all the gift of healing is every minister should have it everybody you see should have a gift of healing the power that heals you is on the inside of you the holy spirit you just have to let it work its way out so brother ron wanted to come and and we were excited about him coming i started praying and fasting in the preparation for his coming here he was going to leave um his after church on sunday and drive here and would arrive on monday which he did but after making the decision to come he told his family now you just watch the devil try to stop this and and of course he did but the devil don't have enough amen my wife karen was excited about him coming she was gonna make his favorite german chocolate cake and went shopping on thursday to get all the supplies for his arrival and and um and then that night at about 11 p.m she woke me up by going to the bathroom turning on the light and i asked her if she was okay and she said i've got a terrible headache and she mentioned she was going into another room and and take her blood pressure and i followed her in there and found her with her head on the table groaning and um i said we we've got to go to the hospital now and she said she protested no i don't want to go i don't need to go i just threw a robe around her and made her get in the car and we were you know on her way she was just groaning and moaning and there would be moments that i was thought she had passed out and she became nauseated throwing up and uh i was going to drive all the way to shreveport because that's where the neuro unit is in the trauma unit in freeport at the lsu ostrich and the doctors but i i couldn't make it that far because of her throwing up and the pain level and so i whipped into menden medical center and there they um intubated her and she was totally unconscious doctor's report from the scams was she wasn't going to make it yeah she had a huge brain bleed it was pushing the right side of her brain out of position and the damage would cause her to die and if she lived the doctor said she would only be a vegetable well friday morning sister karen had emergency brain surgery where they relieved the pressure they cauterized the vessels and you know i as i was just praying and assessing the situation i just began to realize that she was there in the nicu that and and i stood beside her there immediately i watched her when she was wheeled out of surgery and stood there by our bedside on friday and saturday morning i was there again and as i was praying there i just said you know i'm not going to let this stop brother ron from coming and so i made arrangements for him for my daughters to um to go to the icu room since their mother was really you know out of it didn't didn't know really what was going on and so i made arrangements for them to go and i called brother ron and i said um i i you come on i said we'll meet over at our camp there at haven's rest and and uh so he he he came they left right after church on sunday he ministered they drove all the way to birmingham from birmingham they came here to louisiana monday night we had a prayer meeting together and i guarantee you when you're in a moment like this you just don't just say god bless so-and-so and so it's a moment of desperation and you know it was a great time in the presence of the lord but i just felt like there was more and i knew i would have another opportunity and tuesday evening we spent the evening speaking of the exploits of faith and creating as i tried to channel the conversation because i wanted to generate a an atmosphere of faith and we just began to talk about exploits of faith and different testimonies of god's healing power and i i began to feel the atmosphere get more and more charged and uh brother aaron and and of course brother timothy brother michael dexter was there and and brother aaron was about to leave and i said don't leave i said you know i want we want to pray we want to have another time of prayer and this time there was a breakthrough to the anointing and then the then as as we seen the holy spirit just come down it was just things that was you know had been on brother ron's heart he had desired to come back to louisiana again the devil told him he would never be here again and then he wanted to be in a prayer line with me again and the devil told him you'll never have another prayer line with brother tim but right there in that in that camp we had a prayer line and prayed for luke and andrew and adam frazier connie's nephew and god just moved upon them in a tremendous way filling them with the holy spirit of god and and um you know what a presence that was and we saw the holy spirit move and then wednesday night we come to church and brother ron and i spent time together in my office where as you know the testif he testified of seeing the angel of god and together we prayed again right in that very same spot and since that time god has given brother ron some amazing strength and he has preached with such anointing such anointing and such power since that time and i checked upon him as he arrived home leaving wednesday night and let me just stop here for a moment because that wednesday night service went right on over to brother timothy's house and followed them into the house that anointing and the holy spirit fell upon his children the girls there adriana and katie and god did some amazing things in their life and adriana was testifying to me that she got what she needed to be able to testify i have the holy spirit in my life what a wonderful thing god's moving amen what he did he'll for them he'll do for you amen but um brother ron of course the next day uh getting home on thursday i called him to check on him he's already gone down on three hours to see his dad and has to come three two hours back and the next day he's gone again doing a route with with his son and and different things and he ain't stopped and today today in his home church he's preaching a convention meeting where the service is going to be sent to brother harold hildebrand and brother brother hammermeister there in edmonton where they're going to be playing it in their convention so he's already back to preaching conventions again hallelujah my god is unstoppable his people are unstoppable and the devil don't have enough but god is more than enough i said he's more than enough you'll meet your need this morning whatever it is because this god is thou shalt i and he's more than enough to meet your need to fill you with his spirit to give you a repression from his presence to give you another feeling of the holy ghost to take out the lukewarmness and put in there the power of the living god the power of his resurrection hallelujah hallelujah that's a general standing there brother ron spencer god bless him
