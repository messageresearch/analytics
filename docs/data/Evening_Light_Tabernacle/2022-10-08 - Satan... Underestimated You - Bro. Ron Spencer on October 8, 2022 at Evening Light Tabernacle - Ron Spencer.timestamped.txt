[1:05:08] Hallelujah
[1:05:09] it ain't good to us
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:13] you know there's just nobody that can
[1:05:15] touch us like him
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:19] and when he comes by we're very much
[1:05:22] aware that our lives are never the same
[1:05:28] one service
[1:05:30] can make the difference in your life
[1:05:34] just one time
[1:05:37] you can go for years and then all of a
[1:05:39] sudden
[1:05:40] you just realize he's there
[1:05:44] and you're standing on Holy Ground and
[1:05:46] the angel of the Lord is there
[1:05:50] these have been very special meetings
[1:05:52] and
[1:05:54] I'm sure tonight will be very special
[1:05:56] for someone
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:06:00] we could just grasp the moment that
[1:06:02] we're standing in
[1:06:04] we've heard some incredible thoughts
[1:06:06] already
[1:06:08] this morning as
[1:06:11] as we realize that we're we're not just
[1:06:14] looking to a vision we're walking in it
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:18] there was a day where Abraham
[1:06:20] was fellowshipping with Isaac
[1:06:24] now throughout eternity God has looked
[1:06:28] for this moment
[1:06:30] for your coming home
[1:06:34] we're under great anticipation of going
[1:06:36] home
[1:06:38] but he's even greater anticipating
[1:06:40] having you there at a table already
[1:06:44] prepared
[1:06:46] and got a seat for you
[1:06:50] thousands of miles long

[1:07:48] there was a man named Jerry as he left
[1:07:51] his house

[1:08:54] send your word to where she's at right
[1:08:58] now
[1:08:59] Satan turned her loose

[1:09:05] of a Preacher
[1:09:10] a name that is above every name a name
[1:09:14] that is above every Power Of Satan in
[1:09:17] Jesus Christ's name May our faith rise
[1:09:21] into another realm tonight for her

[1:10:24] but Jesus knows how to touch our hearts
[1:10:35] I know something about those kind of
[1:10:37] prayers
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:42] Heavenly Father

[1:14:07] standing here
[1:14:09] but we're still standing

[1:14:15] different battles and
[1:14:17] and I want to thank you for your prayers
[1:14:21] and uh thank you for your continued love
[1:14:24] for us and our family and God has

[1:14:33] much to us and
[1:14:35] I apologize first of all that I couldn't

[1:14:40] but my body's pretty
[1:14:42] my body's pretty gets wore out and so
[1:14:46] the daily journey is Pretty Tough at
[1:14:49] times so
[1:14:50] I want to if you could do something for
[1:14:52] me if you would just just before we read
[1:14:55] our scriptures would you just look over
[1:14:57] at your neighbor

[1:15:43] and a great Queen for me and I thank her
[1:15:47] for that
[1:15:48] amen I I wouldn't want to trade my
[1:15:51] battle for what brother Tim has had to
[1:15:53] go through
[1:15:54] a man losing his Queen but she she's
[1:15:57] waiting on him tonight in a brand new
[1:15:59] body and we wouldn't want to call her
[1:16:01] back for all the money in the whole wide
[1:16:03] world and and so we just we just are
[1:16:07] thankful for everything that he's done
[1:16:11] I'd like to speak to you just for a
[1:16:14] little bit if you if you don't mind
[1:16:17] foreign
[1:16:18] I'd like to speak to you on Satan
[1:16:21] underestimated you
[1:16:27] Psalms chapter 46 and verse 1.
[1:16:33] God is our refuge
[1:16:36] and strength
[1:16:39] and a very present help
[1:16:41] in trouble
[1:16:43] I'd like for you to read that with me
[1:16:45] just now
[1:16:47] God is our refuge and strength a very
[1:16:52] present help in trouble you may be
[1:16:55] seated
[1:17:03] I believe tonight that
[1:17:06] this has been on my heart for about
[1:17:07] three months as I would stand in this
[1:17:09] Pulpit tonight that this would be my
[1:17:12] opening statement
[1:17:17] I am walking out of this storm
[1:17:21] hey
[1:17:22] man
[1:17:34] a few years ago I stood in this pulpit
[1:17:36] and
[1:17:37] preached a sermon called take it back
[1:17:42] it was in October and then from October
[1:17:44] to December God would speak to me on
[1:17:48] December the 22nd and speak to me and
[1:17:51] said if you will trust me I will use you
[1:17:54] like never before
[1:17:57] we'd seen phenomenal miracles happen in
[1:18:00] our lives in our ministry and preached
[1:18:02] in incredible places
[1:18:04] had a opportunity to speak in China
[1:18:08] opportunity to speak in many places
[1:18:10] overseas many conventions God has
[1:18:13] allowed us to see phenomenal things
[1:18:16] happen
[1:18:17] maybe in my mind Zia was thinking that
[1:18:20] God was going to take our ministry to an
[1:18:22] even higher level
[1:18:25] but sometimes God reminds us this
[1:18:30] that he has confidence in US
[1:18:34] that allows battles to come our way
[1:18:38] it's not confidence in our flesh or even
[1:18:41] in our spirit
[1:18:43] but his confidence in deceit
[1:18:46] and if you remember God had confidence
[1:18:48] in job
[1:18:50] before that that Satan could touch his
[1:18:55] body
[1:18:57] Satan had to walk before God
[1:19:01] and he had talked with God and God spoke
[1:19:04] to him and and in no way am I putting
[1:19:07] myself on the level of job but I just
[1:19:09] want to use it for a reference job and
[1:19:12] he asked God asked him said have you
[1:19:14] considered my servant job
[1:19:17] we know the story
[1:19:20] and many things happened to job more
[1:19:24] than any of us in this building could
[1:19:26] even compare
[1:19:29] God would come to job in any situation
[1:19:33] God would come to job and when he came
[1:19:36] down and
[1:19:37] and came to where job was at
[1:19:40] God didn't talk to job about the
[1:19:44] difficulties of all of his trials
[1:19:48] he didn't tell him about the losing of
[1:19:50] his children losing of his wealth losing
[1:19:54] of his health
[1:19:56] he asked him a question where was you
[1:20:00] when I laid the foundations of the Earth
[1:20:03] and he began to describe what heaven was
[1:20:06] all alike
[1:20:07] he didn't just begin to describe how
[1:20:10] great that he was
[1:20:14] are you with me now
[1:20:17] I believe that God knows exactly our
[1:20:20] situations
[1:20:21] we are reminded in Psalms chapter 91
[1:20:24] that the angels of God are encamped
[1:20:28] about us
[1:20:30] so we must sometimes look back at the
[1:20:33] battles that we have went through
[1:20:36] so if I would consider tonight and look
[1:20:39] back
[1:20:41] I would like to remind our enemy
[1:20:46] have you forgot
[1:20:48] that I experienced the doctors telling
[1:20:50] me that I would never walk again after
[1:20:53] falling 40 feet
[1:20:57] and I would be paralyzed the rest of my
[1:20:59] life
[1:21:00] have you forgotten that it was in a fire
[1:21:03] after being in a coma for weeks and
[1:21:07] weeks and and they were going to harvest
[1:21:09] my organs
[1:21:11] have you forgotten that God woke us up
[1:21:15] and restored our minds
[1:21:18] and restored our bodies restored the
[1:21:22] lungs
[1:21:25] have you forgotten
[1:21:27] all of these things that have happened
[1:21:30] as a doctor would look over at us the
[1:21:33] other day a new doctor in the in the
[1:21:36] palliative care team and she looked over
[1:21:38] and I watched her reading our report and
[1:21:41] I just asked her I said what are your
[1:21:43] readings you said I'm reading your
[1:21:44] report she said you don't look like your
[1:21:47] report
[1:21:48] your report says you're a very sick man
[1:21:51] [Applause]
[1:22:04] I want to take us back to a cave
[1:22:06] experience
[1:22:07] brother Branham says no my mind is going
[1:22:10] back to around two years ago
[1:22:14] would in the room that night that the
[1:22:17] angel of God came walking in there and
[1:22:20] said you have been born in this world to
[1:22:23] take a gift of Divine Healing to the
[1:22:25] people
[1:22:27] many will not believe you
[1:22:31] but now he's going to talk about me
[1:22:35] yet many will
[1:22:43] if you'll be sincere
[1:22:45] and we'll get the people to believe
[1:22:49] not even cancer
[1:22:52] shall stand before your prayer
[1:22:58] let me just let me just say this to you
[1:23:01] your condition
[1:23:03] cancer would be one of the greatest
[1:23:05] goliaths of this day
[1:23:09] but not even cancer
[1:23:12] is greater than our God
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:16] when we begin to think about God created
[1:23:19] his own enemy
[1:23:21] that God that created the Sun the moon
[1:23:23] and stars that wrote The Zodiacs in the
[1:23:27] heavens
[1:23:28] God's first Bible in the heavens God
[1:23:32] created it all
[1:23:34] the other day we were in we were in
[1:23:37] Saskatoon what was up a couple hours
[1:23:39] above Saskatoon we were looking for the
[1:23:42] Northern Lights it was that night that
[1:23:44] they wouldn't show up but we were
[1:23:45] looking at the stars and
[1:23:48] I you know I I I don't know too much
[1:23:51] about stars and but anyway brother
[1:23:54] Timothy had an app on his
[1:23:56] on his phone and and he just kind of
[1:23:59] pointed it up at certain stars and it
[1:24:02] would show the the bear
[1:24:05] yeah
[1:24:06] oh yeah I could see it then
[1:24:11] it would show the Milky Way
[1:24:15] well I could see it then
[1:24:20] but just a couple of seconds before it I
[1:24:22] I couldn't see it I I was looking at the
[1:24:25] whole picture but I I couldn't figure
[1:24:27] out what it was like
[1:24:29] but it's in meetings like this that God
[1:24:32] shows us
[1:24:38] and you see yourself in the word and
[1:24:42] God knows exactly how to show you where
[1:24:45] you're at
[1:24:49] now he creates his own enemy
[1:24:51] an infinite God
[1:24:54] creates an enemy
[1:24:56] that will fight like a winner
[1:24:59] knowing he's a loser
[1:25:06] he will start in heaven
[1:25:09] he will come to the Earth
[1:25:11] he will walk right into the Garden of
[1:25:14] Eden
[1:25:17] he would he would destroy the the image
[1:25:20] of the Garden of Eden and he will begin
[1:25:23] to walk through the DNA of humanity
[1:25:27] because God chose a Battlefield
[1:25:30] and it would be in the mind of humanity
[1:25:33] it's where they would fight
[1:25:36] two opposing spirits
[1:25:39] fighting one another but I want to
[1:25:42] remind the devil tonight we're on God's
[1:25:45] side
[1:25:46] [Applause]
[1:25:52] to us posing Spirits I know this is
[1:25:55] Elementary
[1:25:57] life and Hate
[1:26:01] both of them are incredible powerful
[1:26:04] our world is filled with hate
[1:26:07] our world is filled with jealousy and
[1:26:10] envy
[1:26:12] but there's a god of love
[1:26:14] that is greater than all the hate in the
[1:26:17] entire world
[1:26:19] faith and doubt are complete opposites
[1:26:23] positive and negative are complete
[1:26:26] opposites
[1:26:27] if you want to live a positive life
[1:26:30] speak positive things
[1:26:32] [Applause]
[1:26:34] light and darkness are complete
[1:26:36] opposites
[1:26:38] the scriptures would tell us that we
[1:26:40] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:26:43] against principalities and against the
[1:26:45] rulers of Darkness of this world and
[1:26:48] against wickedness in high place
[1:26:51] brother Brandon would remind us that we
[1:26:55] are in a contest
[1:26:57] I think it's interesting that our
[1:27:00] prophet of this age
[1:27:03] would be a boxer as a Young Man
[1:27:07] he would be an undefeated boxer
[1:27:10] he would be a a very lightweight man
[1:27:13] with a quick hand
[1:27:15] with a quick eyes
[1:27:18] that would stand and battle men
[1:27:22] yet there would be one man
[1:27:25] uh six second that would that would hit
[1:27:28] him so hard it felt like it would take
[1:27:30] the life out of him and he would teach
[1:27:32] him about being able to take the punch
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:38] we realized that a contest is a is a
[1:27:41] test of strength
[1:27:43] it's a test of will it's a test of 40
[1:27:46] field
[1:27:47] we must realize that tonight that there
[1:27:51] is nothing is great
[1:27:53] as the power that God put on the inside
[1:27:55] of you
[1:27:57] you must realize tonight that you're not
[1:28:00] trusting in your Humanity
[1:28:03] yet we listen to our humanity and our
[1:28:07] feelings
[1:28:08] our memory our conscience we listen to
[1:28:11] our imaginations we listen to all of
[1:28:14] those things in our life and sometimes
[1:28:16] let that guide us
[1:28:19] but if we could listen to the word of
[1:28:21] God and see what the word of God said
[1:28:24] about us
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:28] let me just say even in my battle
[1:28:32] retreating and quitting is not even an
[1:28:35] option
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:41] I'd like to say this to you maybe you're
[1:28:44] on the fence somewhere another
[1:28:47] and you're saying well brother Ron I
[1:28:49] just feel like quitting what are you
[1:28:51] going to go back to
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:28:55] okay where are you going to go back to
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:00] where you gonna go
[1:29:02] tell me a messenger that is out there
[1:29:04] that had a greater Ministry than William
[1:29:06] Branham
[1:29:10] tell me a greater life than what you see
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:19] you've heard some of the greatest
[1:29:21] singers in the entire world standing on
[1:29:23] this stage
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:26] God has provided the very best
[1:29:30] you are surrounded by the greatest
[1:29:33] people in the entire world
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:44] but if the enemy could he would divide
[1:29:47] you
[1:29:48] he'll tell you he don't that God don't
[1:29:50] love you the people sitting beside of
[1:29:53] you don't love you
[1:29:56] because he gets in your mind but you
[1:29:59] must not listen to him
[1:30:03] somebody's got something against you
[1:30:05] brother Branham said it even in a spot
[1:30:08] that boxer even in that spot when he'd
[1:30:11] lost his wife and now his baby's dying
[1:30:13] the devil began to whisper in his ear
[1:30:15] and just when he was getting ready to
[1:30:17] give up
[1:30:20] his Humanity felt like giving up
[1:30:22] something rose up on the inside of him
[1:30:31] I want to report to you regardless of
[1:30:34] what your circumstances is nothing is
[1:30:37] impossible to our God nothing nothing
[1:30:40] nothing nothing nothing nothing
[1:30:49] foreign
[1:30:54] the scripture says fear not
[1:30:57] fear is real it's mentioned 600 times in
[1:31:01] your Bible so fear is very real
[1:31:04] but Jesus would remind Jarius fear not
[1:31:08] the angel will remind the brother
[1:31:10] Branham fear not I want to remind you to
[1:31:13] not feel the light
[1:31:15] all right
[1:31:17] that's the darkness gets darker and
[1:31:19] darker fear not Jesus is in US
[1:31:22] [Applause]
[1:31:34] we're the final runners
[1:31:37] sorry I'm going slow but I I want to
[1:31:40] drive these points home
[1:31:41] we are the final runners
[1:31:44] all of those Beyond that's when in the
[1:31:47] grave that did their best they didn't
[1:31:48] die in defeat they died in Victory
[1:31:52] Karen Pruitt did not die in defeat she
[1:31:55] died in faith and in the truth
[1:31:57] she stepped from this Dimension to a
[1:31:59] brand new body and she's dancing and
[1:32:02] rejoicing
[1:32:08] we are the final runners
[1:32:10] God's Got Confidence in the seed that he
[1:32:13] placed on the inside of you
[1:32:19] and we refuse to give up
[1:32:23] we're Mighty in battle
[1:32:26] we would be like Daniel standing in
[1:32:28] front of a a den getting ready to step
[1:32:31] in
[1:32:34] Moses with two million people
[1:32:37] standing in a Red Sea
[1:32:40] shamgar with a six foot stick in his
[1:32:42] hand
[1:32:44] David with a rock
[1:32:46] it looks like Satan gets the odds on you
[1:32:50] but he
[1:32:51] underestimated you
[1:32:56] I want to give you some reasons why
[1:32:58] Satan underestimates you
[1:33:01] because he's defeated most of your
[1:33:04] family DNA
[1:33:09] and sin has passed all along
[1:33:12] and and there's been drugs and
[1:33:14] prostitutes and all different kinds in
[1:33:16] your family
[1:33:20] they were lost they were just flesh
[1:33:22] going through life
[1:33:23] their books were written and their Grace
[1:33:26] came on the scene but God rich in Mercy
[1:33:34] God rich in Mercy he came looking after
[1:33:38] you you wasn't looking after God but God
[1:33:41] came looking after you
[1:33:49] he called you before the foundational
[1:33:52] world so he knew when you would be born
[1:33:54] he knew when you would arrive and
[1:33:57] regardless of the DNA that was stacked
[1:34:00] against you in your life and in your
[1:34:03] fleshly Humanity no wonder Satan
[1:34:06] underestimated you but God
[1:34:14] my God
[1:34:17] ignited an eternal seed that cannot be
[1:34:22] defeated
[1:34:23] [Applause]
[1:34:32] brother William said the right mental
[1:34:33] attitude toward any Divine promise of
[1:34:35] God will bring it to pass
[1:34:38] healing is in your body
[1:34:50] I need a Coke
[1:34:56] brother van says and you know your enemy
[1:34:59] and you train for the contest
[1:35:04] and you're going to have
[1:35:06] when you meet him
[1:35:12] you know your enemy and you train for
[1:35:14] the contest
[1:35:16] that you're going to have when you meet
[1:35:17] him
[1:35:19] because you're going to have to meet him
[1:35:22] and you know you know his
[1:35:25] you know what his strength is
[1:35:27] and you train for this contest
[1:35:30] when you do meet him
[1:35:33] for it's one thing for sure you're going
[1:35:35] to meet him
[1:35:38] and so you train for the contest now
[1:35:41] training for a contest is just like a
[1:35:44] boxer
[1:35:45] his enemy that he's going to meet out
[1:35:48] there in a contest to fight a real good
[1:35:51] fighter usually knows and studies his
[1:35:54] opponent his studies his lips knows
[1:35:58] where he fight where he fights for
[1:36:00] whether he leans forward or hangs back
[1:36:02] or fights right or handed or left-handed
[1:36:05] he studies all of this and then if he's
[1:36:07] good and smart fighter he gets he gets a
[1:36:11] sparring partner
[1:36:12] [Applause]
[1:36:14] that'll fight just like his opponent
[1:36:16] fights for he'll know all the licks when
[1:36:19] he gets to the place and I think that's
[1:36:22] very good for Christians to do
[1:36:26] and now if you want to start training
[1:36:29] start at John chapter 3 and verse 16.
[1:36:33] the golden Rules start out right with
[1:36:36] that and you'll and you'll get on the
[1:36:38] floor and then train for it for the for
[1:36:41] The Knockout punches because you're
[1:36:44] going to have to use them
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:49] listen it's not just for the preachers
[1:36:51] to do every one of us has got to fight
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:57] this ain't Hollywood you gotta fight
[1:37:01] oh my brother Ron I've been knocked down
[1:37:03] and bruised and beaten and I've been
[1:37:05] went through a whole lot of things that
[1:37:06] I've been in sin and out of sin and I've
[1:37:09] just
[1:37:10] yeah
[1:37:12] you get knocked down get back up
[1:37:31] Muhammad Ali
[1:37:35] would whisper in his opponent's ears
[1:37:39] is that all you got
[1:37:45] after they've exhausted themselves
[1:37:48] is that all you got
[1:37:50] is that the best punch that you got
[1:37:55] are you wore out yet
[1:37:59] you're gonna lay on the floor in just a
[1:38:01] few minutes
[1:38:02] let's give these people a good show
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:10] Satan would have done got you
[1:38:13] he would have done destroyed you
[1:38:16] if he could but you're still standing
[1:38:27] why don't you tell him is that all you
[1:38:29] got
[1:38:32] he would have done took your life if it
[1:38:34] had took it
[1:38:38] sin would have consumed you if it could
[1:38:41] have
[1:38:42] it's gonna take a stronger wind than
[1:38:44] this
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:10] brother Isaiah you and your wife please
[1:39:13] stare
[1:39:16] Satan thought he had him
[1:39:19] he thought he had him
[1:39:22] their life was a mess just a few years
[1:39:24] ago
[1:39:28] but intermediate
[1:39:33] intermediate
[1:39:37] you didn't know what was going on but in
[1:39:40] a meeting
[1:39:41] two omnipotence was meeting

[1:41:28] right here about brother Guido

[1:41:44] preach
[1:41:45] I don't remember when but anyway he's
[1:41:48] preaching and right in the middle he
[1:41:49] stops and he tells the story about a
[1:41:53] sister goes to a nursing home and she
[1:41:56] meets somebody there that she knew as a
[1:41:59] child and they begin to talk about
[1:42:03] about their lives and begin to catch on
[1:42:07] catch up for a bit and then after a
[1:42:09] while it becomes spiritual and they
[1:42:12] begin to talk about where they
[1:42:14] fellowship at
[1:42:16] and the one says well I go to a
[1:42:18] Pentecostal church and and the sister
[1:42:20] says well I I fell a ship around the
[1:42:23] message of William Branham
[1:42:27] and said you have you ever heard of him
[1:42:29] she said well
[1:42:32] and kind of an odd way my husband is the
[1:42:36] one that drove the car
[1:42:43] that hit the little boy
[1:42:46] and he witnessed the whole miracle
[1:43:02] now Andrew set him beside it for me and
[1:43:05] I and I I know I've got this note that
[1:43:07] I'm getting ready to talk about and I
[1:43:10] tell Andrew I tell Andrew what brother
[1:43:12] biscoll has told about the story I said
[1:43:15] if we need confirmation on it
[1:43:19] yeah
[1:43:20] if we need confirmation on it here is a
[1:43:24] confirmation and I turned to Connie and
[1:43:27] I began to tell her she said in on this
[1:43:29] side of me and I and I and I tell her
[1:43:32] what I've just heard and she said listen
[1:43:34] to what I'm listening to right now and
[1:43:37] brother Branham is telling the story
[1:43:39] about the little boy
[1:43:52] thank you

[1:43:59] trips with us

[1:44:04] all of that took place at me and you can
[1:44:06] help me if I get this wrong went to the
[1:44:08] place where all of that took place at at
[1:44:11] the next meeting people had heard about
[1:44:13] the miracle that took place and there
[1:44:15] was there was 12 rows of cots and
[1:44:18] wheelchairs of there and when brother
[1:44:20] Branham walks in the building
[1:44:22] he hasn't said a word when he walks in
[1:44:25] the building all of those cops and
[1:44:28] wheelchairs just empty
[1:44:30] [Music]
[1:44:31] [Applause]

[1:44:53] all right quit fighting he said how do
[1:44:56] you feel brother Branham

[1:45:00] coming in different languages and things

[1:45:07] he said so
[1:45:09] he said never been failed afraid yet
[1:45:13] because he told me so
[1:45:16] and I believe it's the truth
[1:45:21] are you with me now
[1:45:23] if he told me tonight to go to the
[1:45:26] presidential graveyard
[1:45:28] and raise up George Washington

[1:45:36] [Applause]
[1:45:41] come on
[1:45:43] are you with me now
[1:45:46] brother man would say if I've not told
[1:45:48] you the truth made God strike me dead
[1:45:51] Satan was opposing him
[1:45:54] but he couldn't do it
[1:46:05] Jesus said himself
[1:46:07] if I do not the works of my father then
[1:46:10] Believe Me Not
[1:46:11] if I claim to have an anointing and do
[1:46:14] not the works of my father because I am
[1:46:16] anointed by him and with him it's not me
[1:46:19] that doeth the works
[1:46:21] the father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[1:46:24] the works and if I do not them works
[1:46:27] then don't believe me but if I do then
[1:46:31] believe them
[1:46:32] now that was for the Messiah the for
[1:46:36] messiah it's the church
[1:46:40] all right yeah are you ready John 14 12
[1:46:45] Jesus said he that believeth on me the
[1:46:48] works that I do shall he do also so why
[1:46:53] should we not
[1:46:56] believe that these signs shall follow
[1:46:59] them that believe
[1:47:01] in my name they'll cast out devils in my
[1:47:05] name they'll speak with new tongues
[1:47:08] they'll shout they'll dance
[1:47:12] president said the modern Church
[1:47:16] don't want any of them screaming
[1:47:18] shouting that's 238 dungeons around her
[1:47:21] whooping
[1:47:23] I'm afraid a lot of modern message
[1:47:25] churches don't want Holy Ghost Field
[1:47:28] preachers
[1:47:32] Hallelujah
[1:47:34] but that's the kind that shakes the
[1:47:36] devil
[1:47:45] you get your child full of the Holy
[1:47:47] Ghost you won't have to worry about
[1:47:48] drugs pornography alcohol the wrong kind
[1:47:52] of friends
[1:47:54] but if you get them full of the Holy
[1:47:56] Ghost they'll shake the house of hell
[1:48:04] why should these we be scared of that
[1:48:16] God said I am the Lord thy God who
[1:48:18] healeth
[1:48:22] all thy diseases

[1:48:36] lot of people
[1:48:37] that can talk about a fight that ain't
[1:48:39] never been anyone
[1:48:45] there's a lot of people that are
[1:48:47] self-made Champions and they never got a
[1:48:49] scratch
[1:48:52] they're like lieutenants that just come
[1:48:54] out of school
[1:48:56] that think that they can command men and
[1:48:58] they never saw bullets flying and and
[1:49:01] the fire going on but we got some people
[1:49:04] in this building that are battle tested
[1:49:07] for the word they are built for laodicea
[1:49:10] conditions they will overcome
[1:49:15] it will overcome they know how to pray
[1:49:18] because prayer is like an atomic weapon
[1:49:21] against the devil
[1:49:32] God
[1:49:33] Jesus said if a house be divided against
[1:49:35] itself
[1:49:37] if Satan cast out Satan then his kingdom
[1:49:40] is divided
[1:49:43] don't underestimate the devil
[1:49:46] he's too smart
[1:49:47] Satan ain't going to cast himself out
[1:49:51] he's got you confused
[1:49:53] Satan can't cast out Satan
[1:49:57] me cast myself out why I know better
[1:49:59] than that notice
[1:50:01] don't you underestimate Jesus Christ
[1:50:05] he's the power above all powers
[1:50:09] he's the power above all powers I want
[1:50:11] to say it to all the Realms of hell can
[1:50:13] hear it Jesus Christ is the power above
[1:50:16] all powers
[1:50:21] don't be afraid of Satan
[1:50:24] as long as you're in him
[1:50:29] but if you're not in him you better
[1:50:31] tremble but if you're in him
[1:50:34] not even death itself can harm you
[1:50:38] you're free from all field

[1:50:49] the conditions and regardless of what
[1:50:51] doctors say and regardless of the
[1:50:53] battles
[1:50:55] and regardless of the chemo that I have
[1:50:57] to take every day

[1:51:18] situation
[1:51:20] let's stand and fight like never before
[1:51:23] let's finish this
[1:51:39] the scriptures in Numbers Chapter 23 and
[1:51:42] verse 19 said God is not a man that he
[1:51:44] should lie
[1:51:45] neither the son of man that he should
[1:51:48] repent
[1:51:49] have they said and shall he not do it or
[1:51:53] hath he spoken or shall he not make it
[1:51:55] good behold I have received commandment
[1:51:57] to bless and he hath blessed and I could
[1:51:59] not reverse it he hath not beheld the
[1:52:02] iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen
[1:52:05] perverseness in Israel the Lord his God
[1:52:07] is with him and the shout of the king is
[1:52:10] among them
[1:52:12] what's going on in their churches what's
[1:52:15] going on the move right now this is what
[1:52:18] we preached about for decades and now
[1:52:21] it's happening
[1:52:25] don't take this for granted this will
[1:52:28] push us right into a Rapture into a body
[1:52:31] change
[1:52:33] don't be against the move of God this is
[1:52:36] what's going to transform your body
[1:52:53] brother Brown says now God always has
[1:52:55] got somebody
[1:52:56] that's not scared
[1:53:03] way back on the backside of a desert
[1:53:07] hurting his puppy's sheep
[1:53:10] was a little old Ruddy
[1:53:14] stoop-shouldered boy
[1:53:17] that knowed something about God
[1:53:22] he wasn't a trained fighter
[1:53:24] but when he heard that giant make that
[1:53:27] expression
[1:53:29] he said do you mean to tell me that
[1:53:33] you'll stand here and let that
[1:53:35] uncircumcised full listing defy the
[1:53:38] armies of the Living God
[1:53:41] if you all are scared let me
[1:53:48] let me
[1:53:50] if you are a bunch of chicken-hearted
[1:53:53] preachers let me go find it

[1:56:04] that means that's where your origin came
[1:56:06] from
[1:56:09] so many times
[1:56:11] we as Humanity want to trace our natural
[1:56:14] DNA
[1:56:16] and then our natural DNA
[1:56:19] we want it to be royalty
[1:56:22] we want it to be a part of the Adam's
[1:56:24] Presidential Library
[1:56:27] [Applause]
[1:56:29] and we found out we were slaves
[1:56:34] sorry
[1:56:36] [Applause]
[1:56:47] but that really went for all of you guys

[1:56:53] were special just trace your DNA a
[1:56:55] little bit baby

[1:57:00] there's going to be some things laying
[1:57:02] in there you ain't going to want to see
[1:57:06] there's a lot of nonsense in there
[1:57:08] there's a lot of illegitimacy in there
[1:57:10] there's a lot of stuff in there that you
[1:57:13] ain't gonna want to see
[1:57:15] but there's only one thing that can
[1:57:17] clean all that up
[1:57:25] books of sin was already on your life
[1:57:28] when you was a little bitty baby
[1:57:31] but God knows how to clear the deed
[1:57:35] he knows how to clear the neither that
[1:57:37] life no wonder Satan underestimated your
[1:57:42] life
[1:57:54] you begin to grow up
[1:57:56] and as you begin to grow up you went to
[1:57:58] school
[1:58:00] and you learned words in French
[1:58:06] that you shouldn't say
[1:58:11] [Applause]
[1:58:15] your mom and daddy Christian people
[1:58:17] never said them words but you went to
[1:58:19] school and you said words you come home
[1:58:22] and said words they
[1:58:24] they don't work here
[1:58:26] we don't say them kind of words
[1:58:29] who taught you to steal
[1:58:31] extra cookie
[1:58:38] who taught you to have jealousy
[1:58:44] who taught you the lust
[1:58:50] you get up a little older and
[1:58:52] you don't have a new birth you look in
[1:58:54] the mail
[1:59:01] and go I need to look like Marilyn
[1:59:03] Monroe
[1:59:15] News Bulletin she wore a size 16.
[1:59:27] Hollywood will point you
[1:59:29] to where our lives are disasters
[1:59:32] [Applause]
[1:59:36] soap operas will point you to where
[1:59:38] lives or disasters some of your friends
[1:59:41] that have been around you in their lives
[1:59:43] they have been disasters in their lives
[1:59:47] what what made you different you came
[1:59:50] from God
[1:59:56] you came from God
[1:59:59] I'm going somewhere here I'm going
[2:00:02] somewhere here
[2:00:07] and just like the negative and positive
[2:00:10] polls
[2:00:11] God sent his great magnet over your way
[2:00:14] and you could not resist this
[2:00:21] let's go
[2:00:25] Hallelujah
[2:00:30] he's sending over your friends and they
[2:00:33] didn't want nothing to do with it he
[2:00:35] sent it over your enemies and they
[2:00:36] didn't want nothing to do with it but
[2:00:38] God brought you to church and you had a
[2:00:41] lot of stuff on your life and the power
[2:00:44] of the word began to clean up your life
[2:00:46] and it cleans you and today you're not
[2:00:50] even the same person you used to be
[2:00:57] all right
[2:01:00] people go to Alcoholics Anonymous
[2:01:04] and they will stay clean
[2:01:09] for a little while because the power of
[2:01:11] a vowel is powerful
[2:01:14] but it won't hold you
[2:01:16] [Applause]
[2:01:21] the power of a vowel will not hold you
[2:01:25] you you could say it over and over and
[2:01:27] over and over and over and over again
[2:01:28] but Along Comes an enticing spirit
[2:01:34] and it can be a lot of different things
[2:01:36] that come to entice you because he just
[2:01:39] keep throwing bait
[2:01:42] he'll
[2:01:44] I'm not a fisherman but the hill I hang
[2:01:47] around one is really good but but you
[2:01:50] know you just keep throwing bait that
[2:01:51] they'll finally bite
[2:01:53] [Applause]
[2:01:56] and so Satan will keep throwing bait
[2:02:02] and if he can get you to look
[2:02:06] like he did in Ellie Sanders she just
[2:02:09] stopped and before long she was dancing
[2:02:12] [Applause]
[2:02:14] that he could just get you to stop and
[2:02:16] look at the wrong sights or to hear the
[2:02:19] wrong music
[2:02:20] [Applause]
[2:02:25] if there's no anchor in your heart
[2:02:26] you'll fall over and over again
[2:02:29] but I'm going to say this to you I don't
[2:02:30] care who you are in this building if
[2:02:32] you're failing 52 times
[2:02:35] there is a power of the blood that can
[2:02:38] raise you up
[2:02:55] maybe up to this night Satan has written
[2:02:59] a lot of things in your book but after
[2:03:01] tonight
[2:03:06] let the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:03:09] wipe it completely clean
[2:03:11] [Applause]
[2:03:22] is this all right
[2:03:25] I felt led to preach this so here we are
[2:03:29] let me just say Satan
[2:03:31] will talk to you into robbing the bank
[2:03:34] and then he'll call the law
[2:03:37] you can be seated
[2:03:45] incredible
[2:03:48] an enemy that was built
[2:03:51] to oppose God
[2:03:53] now becomes our opposer
[2:03:57] when he's got an entire world
[2:03:59] think about this for a minute
[2:04:01] other people have calamities
[2:04:06] other people have discouragements
[2:04:09] other people fall
[2:04:12] other people have car wrecks
[2:04:18] other people have AK-47s pulled out on
[2:04:21] them and
[2:04:23] are killed
[2:04:26] I came to this point the other day in
[2:04:29] another service
[2:04:31] in our church
[2:04:33] two of our kids
[2:04:36] was driving down the road and three guys
[2:04:38] in mask rolled up beside of them at the
[2:04:42] same time I was saying this
[2:04:46] and they rolled up with an AK-47 pointed
[2:04:49] out after them
[2:04:51] and God spared their lives
[2:04:55] there's a difference between you and
[2:04:57] everybody else
[2:04:59] [Applause]
[2:05:13] brother Brown would say this
[2:05:15] who has the most power before God
[2:05:22] an angel
[2:05:24] an angel is a servant is that right
[2:05:27] they're his servants
[2:05:29] what are you
[2:05:32] I'm saying this I'm going slow because I
[2:05:34] want you to catch it
[2:05:36] his son and daughter
[2:05:40] who has the most power in heaven then
[2:05:44] a sinner that's been saved by grace
[2:05:47] or an archangel that's standing by his
[2:05:51] right side
[2:05:54] brother Branham answers his own question
[2:05:56] The Sinner that's been saved by by Grace
[2:05:59] has more Authority in heaven
[2:06:04] then the Archangel that has stood by his
[2:06:07] side without sin
[2:06:09] because he's a son a son has more
[2:06:13] Authority
[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:25] I feel like we're just before the coming
[2:06:28] of the Lord so I'm just gonna I'm just
[2:06:30] gonna step out on the edge here just for
[2:06:32] a bit
[2:06:34] sister Debbie would you would you stand
[2:06:40] sister Debbie shared something with us
[2:06:43] and I
[2:06:44] I'm going to tell it because it's too
[2:06:46] it's too good not to tell
[2:06:49] she's not given to these kinds of things
[2:06:51] to don't think you've ever seen anything
[2:06:53] quite like that
[2:06:56] who was preaching there
[2:07:01] not because of me
[2:07:04] but she saw through that door
[2:07:06] the angel of the Lord stepped through
[2:07:08] that door not open it but she saw the
[2:07:11] angel of the Lord stepped through the
[2:07:13] door and come out here
[2:07:16] isn't that right
[2:07:17] amen thank you
[2:07:22] thank you a couple years ago we were
[2:07:23] here brother Wayne
[2:07:25] and we witnessed the angel of the Lord
[2:07:28] stand right there
[2:07:30] isn't that right
[2:07:32] that's right and he was standing there
[2:07:36] and he was standing there with his arms
[2:07:38] like this right here
[2:07:39] and he had his hand and then he put his
[2:07:42] hand right here
[2:07:44] brother Josh
[2:07:46] was preaching isn't that correct
[2:07:49] and brother Josh was preaching as he was
[2:07:51] standing there and he had his hands like
[2:07:52] this and he put his hand like that and
[2:07:54] when I saw him put his hand like that
[2:07:57] I don't care if you don't believe me
[2:07:58] it's all right
[2:08:02] [Music]
[2:08:11] put his hand like that brother Josh is
[2:08:13] all over the stage he had had a lot more
[2:08:15] energy than I knew I kind of have to
[2:08:17] conserve a bit but anyway he's running
[2:08:19] all over the stage you know this to be
[2:08:21] the truth because he saw it as well and
[2:08:24] brother Josh would come over and put his
[2:08:25] hand on it and then he'd take charge in
[2:08:27] the cross and he'd come over and put his
[2:08:28] hand on it and go charge on a cross come
[2:08:31] over and put his hand on that
[2:08:33] foreign
[2:08:45] meetings on Saturday night
[2:08:49] brother Tim Pruitt walks to the pulpit
[2:08:52] and he speaks on Entertaining Angels
[2:09:00] because they're here to finish the work
[2:09:05] Two Worlds are coming together
[2:09:08] blending together
[2:09:12] after he finished
[2:09:15] and to me it was listen I I've been
[2:09:19] around my buddy a long time now
[2:09:21] I thought it was the greatest sermon he
[2:09:23] ever preached
[2:09:26] go listen to it go listen to it
[2:09:28] it's fine where you're lifting Humanity
[2:09:30] no I'm lifting the gift that's
[2:09:32] inhumanity
[2:09:34] and for those that are in this community
[2:09:36] that's missing the gift they're missing
[2:09:37] out
[2:09:42] listen I'm way too late in the
[2:09:45] late ending around I
[2:09:48] I'm not planning on being in the
[2:09:50] tribulation period
[2:09:51] [Applause]
[2:09:54] if you are build a bomb shelter turn all
[2:09:57] your money into gold get yourself a food
[2:10:00] supply because that's what you're going
[2:10:02] to need for tribulation period and
[2:10:04] you're going to need Faith to get
[2:10:06] yourself through it but for me
[2:10:11] I'm planning on the moment of the
[2:10:14] twinkle little
[2:10:15] this body is going to be changed
[2:10:31] and when brother Tim finished
[2:10:34] sister Lydia
[2:10:37] is she here
[2:10:42] could you stand
[2:10:45] begin to speak in tongues
[2:10:50] she began to speak in tongues
[2:10:53] brother Andrew began to interpret
[2:10:58] because this is what
[2:11:01] the prophecy said would happen in this
[2:11:04] age
[2:11:12] now I know I'm I know I'm making the
[2:11:14] devil real nervous right now
[2:11:19] when those when Peter stood up on the
[2:11:22] day of Pentecost
[2:11:24] and he began to scream out to those
[2:11:27] people these are not drunken as you
[2:11:29] suppose
[2:11:31] but this is that
[2:11:33] that was that was spoken by the prophet
[2:11:37] Joel
[2:11:38] the prophecy
[2:11:40] has intercepted with time
[2:11:43] [Applause]
[2:11:47] and now is in flesh
[2:11:50] what you are witnessing
[2:11:54] God is not just with us but God now is
[2:11:59] in US
[2:12:06] we have become the Tabernacle of God
[2:12:10] he's not looking for a building he's
[2:12:13] looking for a body that he can live in
[2:12:16] [Applause]
[2:12:25] so what you're witnessing
[2:12:28] is this is that
[2:12:33] the final voice to the final age
[2:12:37] this is that that was was prophesied
[2:12:41] bone of his bone life of his life power
[2:12:44] of his power Spirit of his spirit
[2:12:49] this is the very Breath of God this is
[2:12:52] more than Tim Pruitt this is more than
[2:12:55] Ron Spencer this is more than Joshua
[2:12:58] Von's brunt this is more than Johnny
[2:13:00] this is God taking him and flesh
[2:13:15] hello
[2:13:17] what about you
[2:13:20] here's a man that built a table for
[2:13:22] brother
[2:13:24] Tim Pruitt
[2:13:29] could you stand
[2:13:32] that's all right
[2:13:39] he's had a heart condition
[2:13:44] he's not just had a heart condition but
[2:13:46] he's had a leak and he's an aorta valve
[2:13:50] isn't that correct
[2:13:51] yeah
[2:13:54] God dropped this in my heart
[2:13:56] you did a you did a you gave a servant
[2:13:59] of the Lord a blessing
[2:14:05] and now God is going to do a hard
[2:14:08] operation
[2:14:25] thank you
[2:14:42] brother Ron are you scared no sir I know
[2:14:45] where I'm standing
[2:14:49] we have been commissioned to speak it
[2:14:52] not stand there and wrestle with their
[2:14:54] Humanity but speak the word
[2:14:57] and believe the word
[2:14:59] don't you speak to your troubles right
[2:15:01] now
[2:15:15] let me see
[2:15:19] I feel like I'm exploding up here
[2:15:21] because I know where we're going
[2:15:25] now listen to brother Branham as he
[2:15:27] prays
[2:15:28] and as I read this
[2:15:32] probably nobody else drinks Coke in the
[2:15:34] Pulpit but
[2:15:36] you know I
[2:15:38] remember aren't you breaking order
[2:15:41] I broke a lot of orders in my life
[2:15:47] the brother Brandon says we have a right
[2:15:49] to enforce
[2:15:53] if you don't enforce who will
[2:15:56] foreign
[2:15:57] if you don't enforce who will Who will
[2:16:00] do the job
[2:16:03] who would do the job if you don't
[2:16:05] enforce it
[2:16:06] brother Tim Pruitt walked into your room
[2:16:08] brother stinky mad at the Devil
[2:16:13] I learned a long time ago don't call Tim
[2:16:15] Pruitt if you want to live a long time
[2:16:19] if you're dying and they're giving up
[2:16:20] and they're going to harvest your organ

[2:16:48] said pray with me
[2:16:50] I lived 17 hours and I prayed with with
[2:16:53] brother Tim agreeing
[2:16:55] because prayer is not that some priest
[2:16:59] prayer is a God and we have a god-given
[2:17:03] right
[2:17:07] the power of life and death is on the
[2:17:09] inside of our tongue and we have a power
[2:17:12] of the word to enforce our rights own
[2:17:16] Satan and sake giving back give it back

[2:22:26] and I'm bringing that before you
[2:22:29] you have to take your hands off of their
[2:22:32] life
[2:22:33] they belong to God now
[2:22:36] I claim them for you I claim them as
[2:22:40] trophies of Christ's love at Calvary I
[2:22:44] challenge you to a debate
[2:22:46] you don't have any legal power you have
[2:22:50] no power over them
[2:22:53] you didn't have it in the first place
[2:22:56] you was only bluffing them
[2:22:59] you was only bluffing Christ stripped
[2:23:02] you out of everything that you had at
[2:23:05] Calvary and he stripped every Power that
[2:23:08] you ever had
[2:23:09] you're nothing but a bluff
[2:23:12] and we're calling your blood
[2:23:31] foreign
[2:23:34] Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13.
[2:23:37] I can do all things
[2:23:40] through Christ which strengthens me
[2:23:45] I'm coming to an end
[2:23:48] Paul would write this from a prison
[2:23:52] you know this is my favorite scriptures
[2:23:56] and we know that all things
[2:23:58] say it with me all things work together
[2:24:01] for the good to them that love God to
[2:24:04] them who are the called according to his
[2:24:06] purpose
[2:24:18] now if there's anything that anybody
[2:24:20] that I could I would want to hear this
[2:24:21] tonight I'd like for the devil to listen
[2:24:23] up
[2:24:24] put your hearing aids in Satan I want
[2:24:26] you to listen just for the next couple
[2:24:28] of minutes
[2:24:31] for whom he did for no
[2:24:34] that's me
[2:24:36] I want you to go ahead though that's me
[2:24:38] [Applause]
[2:24:39] that's me
[2:24:41] that's me that's me
[2:24:44] he also did predestinate
[2:24:46] to be conformed to the image of his son
[2:24:48] that he might be the firstborn among
[2:24:51] many brethren
[2:24:52] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[2:24:55] he also called
[2:24:57] and whom he called them he also
[2:24:58] Justified
[2:25:00] and remember what justification is it is
[2:25:03] as though you never did it in the first
[2:25:05] place
[2:25:07] I don't care what your book says Isaiah
[2:25:09] it's as though you never did it in the
[2:25:11] first place just tell the devil go back
[2:25:14] to hell just tell him go back to hell
[2:25:16] where it came from I am a son of God
[2:25:22] forgiven I am a Son of God I am his son
[2:25:33] and whom he justified them he also
[2:25:35] glorified
[2:25:36] and what shall we there say to these
[2:25:38] things
[2:25:39] [Music]
[2:25:43] Satan you underestimated me
[2:25:45] [Applause]
[2:25:48] go ahead say it Satan you underestimated
[2:25:51] me
[2:25:53] it is the number one rule
[2:25:57] for an opponent to underestimate you
[2:26:02] number one go ahead and put your finger
[2:26:04] out there
[2:26:05] Satan you broke the number one rule
[2:26:08] you underestimated me
[2:26:20] Hallelujah
[2:26:32] what is it 450 people here tonight I
[2:26:35] want you to read it with me if God be
[2:26:37] false
[2:26:38] who can be against us
[2:26:42] God before us
[2:26:44] who can be against
[2:26:47] say say that to your neighbor
[2:26:49] [Applause]
[2:27:08] sometimes you get the picture wrong
[2:27:11] you got Goliath as a great big man and
[2:27:14] David is a little bitty boy
[2:27:16] but actually the picture was upside down
[2:27:20] because there was a great big God on the
[2:27:22] inside of a little bit Ebola that was
[2:27:24] way bigger than a great big Gala
[2:27:28] it ain't you that's gonna whip the devil
[2:27:31] it's the god that's on the inside of you
[2:27:42] take that devil take that devil take
[2:27:47] that double
[2:27:56] Derek before I walked out of here a
[2:27:59] voice whispered into my ear said tonight
[2:28:01] might be your last night preaching here
[2:28:03] ever
[2:28:04] I said well Deborah I'm gonna whip you
[2:28:07] tonight
[2:28:23] thank you
[2:28:24] Hallelujah
[2:28:34] as the musicians come I want to read you
[2:28:36] one more quote while you're standing
[2:28:39] brother Branham said that I'm so glad
[2:28:41] that a man can so completely serve God
[2:28:49] this is almost unfair thank you
[2:28:52] tell the devil don't know what to do
[2:28:54] with him
[2:28:57] I'm going to read it slow so you can
[2:28:58] repeat it to your neighbor and I want
[2:29:00] you to say it loud enough that you hear
[2:29:01] it yourself
[2:29:03] I'm so glad that a man can so completely
[2:29:07] serve God
[2:29:10] the devil don't know what to do with him
[2:29:28] all right
[2:29:46] brother Brown walked out of a building
[2:29:48] one night and he preached future home he
[2:29:51] looked at his son
[2:29:53] and he said Billy did you get it
[2:29:56] I see I did he said he said Billy did
[2:29:59] you get it
[2:30:02] yeah I did
[2:30:04] and he said Billy did you get it he said
[2:30:06] no I did it
[2:30:12] I'm going to ask you something
[2:30:14] I'm not brother Brown
[2:30:15] but did you just get it
[2:30:21] let's not have this meeting and you
[2:30:23] travel thousands of miles
[2:30:25] let's not just come and clap our hands
[2:30:27] and have music but did you get it
[2:30:45] Hallelujah I feel so good I could run
[2:30:53] I I particularly don't know what those
[2:30:55] cancer cells are going to do but in a
[2:30:57] few days
[2:30:59] I'm gonna have red hair
[2:31:01] [Applause]
[2:31:03] probably gonna weigh about 150 pounds
[2:31:06] and I'm gonna run all over heaven
[2:31:26] one more thing
[2:31:28] Satan can touch your flesh
[2:31:30] and he can touch your spirit
[2:31:33] but God put the seed of God on the
[2:31:36] inside of you where Satan couldn't get
[2:31:38] to
[2:31:40] [Music]
[2:31:42] [Applause]
[2:32:03] your head's about just a moment
[2:32:11] and you could just just to be real
[2:32:13] honest just now
[2:32:15] because remember at the very beginning
[2:32:17] of this service I said that tonight
[2:32:19] could be the difference in your entire
[2:32:20] life
[2:32:25] and maybe you'd like to say brother Ron
[2:32:27] I've been struggling with very secretive
[2:32:30] things
[2:32:31] and I just need to raise my hand before
[2:32:32] God
[2:32:34] and say God I need your help
[2:32:36] I need your help
[2:32:39] I need your help with this
[2:32:44] wow
[2:32:46] I need your help I just knew I want to
[2:32:48] be honest
[2:32:49] I need your help
[2:32:52] you can live a Victorious life you don't
[2:32:55] have to be a Slave
[2:32:57] I want to tell you there's I got some
[2:32:59] really good news
[2:33:00] you can walk out of this building
[2:33:02] tonight and lay your excuses down
[2:33:07] this median is tremendous when it
[2:33:09] becomes you and God
[2:33:11] it's more than just your neighbors and
[2:33:13] one another but it's you and God right
[2:33:15] now in this moment
[2:33:20] maybe buy an exercise and nobody looking
[2:33:22] around maybe about exercising just
[2:33:24] stepping out from where you're at
[2:33:25] walking in this way
[2:33:27] and you're just like say I want to lay
[2:33:29] some things at the altar
[2:33:31] that only I and God know about
[2:33:36] and I just want to lay it here I don't
[2:33:38] want to leave it here
[2:33:40] I want to leave it here
[2:33:51] that don't de-christianize none of us
[2:33:53] because we're all in a battle
[2:33:56] we're all in a battle
[2:33:58] I'm not here to stir you up or make you
[2:34:00] feel bad I want to tell you there's help
[2:34:02] here for you
[2:34:06] never think that we're trying to beat
[2:34:08] you we're trying to help you we're
[2:34:09] trying to
[2:34:11] tell you Jesus is here for you
[2:34:14] he wants to help you
[2:34:18] he didn't go to the woman at the will
[2:34:19] make her feel bad
[2:34:21] he he brought her life
[2:34:24] Hallelujah
[2:34:26] he didn't go to the Tomb of the legion
[2:34:29] and give him a bunch of what had caused
[2:34:31] him to be there
[2:34:33] but in a few moments
[2:34:35] he was a completely different man and he
[2:34:37] went home to live a different life
[2:34:40] I don't know what you've dealt with in
[2:34:42] your last little bit but God would lay
[2:34:43] it on my heart to speak this on Saturday
[2:34:45] evening
[2:34:47] to tell you that Satan don't have enough
[2:34:50] to keep you
[2:34:53] and his ball and chain
[2:34:55] don't have to hold you forever
[2:34:57] because God's got the key to the door
[2:35:01] and he knows how to take and empty all
[2:35:03] of that out and fill you with the holy
[2:35:05] spirit that you can live a private
[2:35:08] overcoming life and become a lighthouse
[2:35:10] where you're at to your community to
[2:35:13] your family to your neighborhood to
[2:35:16] release power in your prayer life
[2:35:20] and when you come to church you're a
[2:35:22] complete different person
[2:35:25] Heavenly Father
[2:35:28] we feel the presence of the Lord all
[2:35:30] through this meeting
[2:35:32] but especially right now
[2:35:37] Satan underestimates the power of God
[2:35:42] he hunched or underestimates the blood
[2:35:44] of Jesus Christ
[2:35:46] so he contrast to continue to hold on
[2:35:49] to real bona fide Christians Warren with
[2:35:53] them
[2:35:54] maybe because he's only got a short time
[2:35:56] to work
[2:35:58] but father you're a God rich in Mercy
[2:36:01] and your mercy endureth forever
[2:36:05] Lord we don't have to tell you be
[2:36:07] prisoners or slaves
[2:36:16] maybe we've driven thousands of miles
[2:36:23] we come to a meeting like this
[2:36:28] and it's you that changes our life
[2:36:33] even before we stepped out of the Pew it
[2:36:36] was you that was dealing with us
[2:36:40] but we know
[2:36:42] it's us and you
[2:36:45] now Lord if we were sitting at the table
[2:36:47] with you and you looked across the table
[2:36:49] and could read our whole heart
[2:36:53] and begin to talk to us
[2:36:56] no doubt you wouldn't do it in a
[2:36:58] condemning spirit
[2:37:03] but there would be something in your
[2:37:05] voice that would change our life
[2:37:11] Lord Jesus
[2:37:13] we have become aware that the angels of
[2:37:15] the Lord are in the building
[2:37:19] you've allowed us to be made known that
[2:37:22] that angels have come and the pillar of
[2:37:24] fire has been seen
[2:37:26] in this meeting
[2:37:29] but Lord you also want to make us aware
[2:37:32] that we're your children
[2:37:34] and we have more Authority than an angel
[2:37:36] in heaven
[2:37:39] now we came from you and that was our
[2:37:42] origin and we're going to go back
[2:37:46] and you placed us here for a purpose to
[2:37:48] overcome
[2:37:51] maybe it's as a father to rededicate our
[2:37:54] life
[2:37:56] to be a real daddy
[2:37:58] maybe Satan's robbed us of our time
[2:38:02] robbedness of our time with our wife and
[2:38:04] robbed us over time with our children
[2:38:08] maybe it's a mama that's got her eyes on
[2:38:11] a lot of different things in life and
[2:38:14] Satan has robbed her of her victory
[2:38:18] maybe even a Revival of prayer life in
[2:38:21] that home
[2:38:22] I believe you're the god that can take a
[2:38:24] meeting like this
[2:38:26] and a home can be rededicated
[2:38:30] I believe that Revival fires can start
[2:38:33] again
[2:38:34] in in hearts of believers
[2:38:38] not that we've done any great sin but
[2:38:41] just got a little cool in our life
[2:38:44] maybe words have been said that's caused
[2:38:46] hardship even to our own Humanity
[2:38:50] father if we could have the Zeal of this
[2:38:53] hour to repent
[2:38:55] to repent of our pride
[2:38:57] repent of our own arrogance
[2:39:00] and say Lord come and soften my heart
[2:39:03] cleanse my spirit
[2:39:06] renew my mind tonight father
[2:39:11] maybe we've lost our joy
[2:39:13] [Music]
[2:39:15] we've lost the joy of our salvation
[2:39:20] David would say creating me a clean
[2:39:23] heart oh God
[2:39:24] and renew a right Spirit Within Me
[2:39:28] restore to me the joy
[2:39:31] of my salvation
[2:39:34] we danced this morning
[2:39:36] We Worship the Lord through this meeting
[2:39:40] but Lord You're mindful that you don't
[2:39:43] want one person to go back
[2:39:45] in the same old habits
[2:39:49] and the same life of a backslidden
[2:39:51] condition
[2:39:52] you would take the time in a meeting
[2:39:55] like this to go after one of your
[2:39:57] children
[2:39:58] you'd leave 90 and 9 to go get one
[2:40:03] so Lord
[2:40:05] go to the cave or the den
[2:40:11] Lord that makes us love you so much more
[2:40:15] foreign
[2:40:23] battle to word to where that feels like
[2:40:25] giving up
[2:40:28] doctors have asked me are you
[2:40:31] are you ready to give up
[2:40:33] my repetitive story is I'll never give
[2:40:36] up
[2:40:38] Lord may we have that not only as a in
[2:40:41] our natural life may we have that in our
[2:40:43] Supernatural life
[2:40:44] we'll never give up
[2:40:46] we'll never turn back we'll never
[2:40:50] retreat but we'll constantly fight
[2:40:55] oh Lord Jesus
[2:40:57] Minister standing all across this
[2:41:00] building
[2:41:01] from Belgium
[2:41:03] Dallas
[2:41:05] Ohio
[2:41:07] Virginia

[2:41:11] Jesus
[2:41:13] Lord renew our church like never before
[2:41:17] Lord don't let us miss nothing that's
[2:41:20] going on
[2:41:21] let us be sensitive to the spirit of the
[2:41:24] Lord May our eyes be Keen May our hearts
[2:41:28] be clear
[2:41:30] Lord reveal to us Lord exactly what we
[2:41:34] have need of
[2:41:35] [Music]
[2:41:37] Lord may we not misalign
[2:41:40] may we be exactly
[2:41:42] as the orchestra would play
[2:41:45] may your timing be perfect
[2:41:49] in Jesus Christ's name
[2:41:52] and any man any man any man amen any man
[2:41:56] maybe wherever you're standing now could
[2:41:58] you just lay your hand over on your
[2:41:59] neighbor

[2:44:47] I make my claim tonight in the name of
[2:44:51] Jesus Christ
[2:44:53] [Music]
[2:44:55] Hallelujah
[2:44:57] now I'm asking you to step into the
[2:44:59] vision that you heard this morning and
[2:45:01] last night
[2:45:02] I want you to just raise your hand
[2:45:04] before God and say God I claim it right

[2:45:31] I Acclaim it
[2:45:35] Satan you underestimated the power of a
[2:45:38] service like this
[2:45:40] you underestimated it
[2:45:49] for you
[2:45:54] I don't know
[2:45:56] why don't you just say it now with me
[2:45:58] I'll never be the same
[2:46:14] [Music]
[2:46:23] now the same Angel of the Lord is here
[2:46:25] [Music]
[2:46:28] was on the stage when Mariah got healed
[2:46:34] he's here right now
[2:46:39] we went to the room
[2:46:42] and Aaron Oglesby was called to preach
[2:46:47] and became aware in that room
[2:46:49] and these were the words you'll never be
[2:46:52] the same
[2:46:56] you'll never be the same
[2:46:59] and immediately after that a vision came
[2:47:01] that my little baby Isaac would be born
[2:47:05] God not only showed me that baby that
[2:47:07] would be born out of impossible signs
[2:47:11] he even gave me his name
[2:47:14] Isaac Jackson Breeden
[2:47:17] you see he's the God that holds it all
[2:47:20] in his hands
[2:47:22] that's the god that's in this building
[2:47:24] now
[2:47:26] and your impossibilities that you think
[2:47:28] are so impossible
[2:47:31] he's got it in his hands right now
[2:47:35] and that same God
[2:47:38] is on the inside of you brother
[2:47:41] that God
[2:47:43] that said let there be a son and he
[2:47:45] believed his own word
[2:47:46] and it came into existence
[2:47:49] that God
