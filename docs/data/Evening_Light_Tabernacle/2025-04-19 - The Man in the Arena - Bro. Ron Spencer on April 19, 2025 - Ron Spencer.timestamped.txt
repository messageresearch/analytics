[39:25] over and over the
[39:30] same
[39:32] power now and forever. You're
[39:37] not saying words can speak to the
[39:41] mountains and make
[39:44] them. I know the God of the old is the
[39:49] God of the new. I know that you did it
[39:55] then and you still do the same
[40:00] power now and forever. No, you're
[40:05] not. Say words can speak to the mountain
[40:10] and make them blue. I know the God of
[40:16] the old is the God of the new. I know
[40:22] that you did it then and you
[40:28] still do.

[58:27] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the

[58:33] ready for the word tonight. Let's play
[58:35] that song again. Only believe, all
[58:37] things are
[58:39] possible. Only
[58:43] believe. I hope you're ready for your
[58:45] miracle tonight.
[58:48] Because we will see
[58:51] miracles. We see giants fall.
[58:54] We've seen it already happen in this
[58:56] meeting as God has dealt with hearts and
[58:59] lives and God has used gifts as channels
[59:04] where heaven has come down among us and
[59:06] the Holy Spirit has spoke to different
[59:09] hearts and lives.
[59:12] We're here at this Saturday night
[59:14] meeting and as we prepare for the word
[59:18] tonight, we have our brother Ron Spencer
[59:22] that's going to be ministering the word
[59:24] tonight. Brother Ron's has spoke in this
[59:27] camp since about 1999 for his first time
[59:31] and then different times through the
[59:33] years.
[59:36] We appreciate brother Ron and his
[59:38] ministry
[59:39] and service to the
[59:45] Lord. I've been with him through a lot
[59:47] of different situations and
[59:50] trials. Been with him through the fire
[59:53] or that he was burnt. They were going to
[59:56] harvest his organs in just a few hours.
[59:59] And I saw God come on the scene after I
[1:00:03] walked into his hospital room and told
[1:00:05] him, "I have not
[1:00:08] come I have not come
[1:00:10] to to
[1:00:12] to tell him he's going to die, but to
[1:00:16] tell him that there's a God that will
[1:00:19] raise up even the dead and cause him to
[1:00:21] live."
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:27] And I've seen the Holy Spirit do a work
[1:00:30] in his life
[1:00:31] and deliver him from
[1:00:34] that. And he had a lung condition
[1:00:37] because of the fire burnt inside and the
[1:00:41] Holy the Lord come down and healed him
[1:00:44] where he had voice
[1:00:46] again power to preach.
[1:00:50] Five years ago, he had a diagnosis of
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:58] cancer. I went
[1:01:00] to his place there in Virginia. I think
[1:01:04] it was in February 5 years
[1:01:07] ago
[1:01:09] [Music]
[1:01:11] 2020. And he had received this diagnosis
[1:01:14] that he only had a few months to live.
[1:01:18] And of course I know one thing that goes
[1:01:21] with cancer is
[1:01:22] [Music]
[1:01:25] fear. And it was there while I was there
[1:01:28] the Holy Spirit come down. Brother
[1:01:30] Donnie Reagan and I met together and we
[1:01:32] prayed with him and all the fear
[1:01:37] left. And on the morning that I was
[1:01:40] leaving and I would attend his first
[1:01:43] doctor visit with the specialist there,
[1:01:46] the the head of the team that would tell
[1:01:49] him what they would
[1:01:53] do. And that morning as I
[1:01:56] lay in bed in the early wee hours of the
[1:01:59] morning, I sat up quickly and looked
[1:02:03] toward the heavens as I heard this song.
[1:02:07] We will see
[1:02:09] miracles. We shall see giants fall.
[1:02:12] We'll walk on
[1:02:17] water. I heard it out of the
[1:02:20] heavens. I heard voices singing from the
[1:02:23] heavenly realm that was singing that
[1:02:26] song. We went together with
[1:02:29] him there to the treatment center.
[1:02:33] There was different things that happened
[1:02:35] even there that I won't go into
[1:02:38] today. But you know, walking on water
[1:02:42] might be like
[1:02:44] Peter. Peter was not just a man that
[1:02:47] walked on water
[1:02:48] once. He walked on water twice.
[1:02:53] You say, "Brother Tim, I've had victory
[1:02:55] over situations in my life and and I got
[1:02:59] my eyes off of Jesus and I fell again."
[1:03:03] Well, I tell you this, God will make you
[1:03:05] walk on water twice. He'll lift you up.
[1:03:09] All you have to do is look to him and
[1:03:11] say,
[1:03:12] "Jesus, I
[1:03:15] perish. Save me."
[1:03:18] He put out a hand to you and he'll bring
[1:03:21] salvation to your
[1:03:23] life. We've been through a lot of ups
[1:03:25] and downs through this
[1:03:27] time. Actually, it would be February of
[1:03:30] last year. I would go again, another
[1:03:34] emergency trip called by the church, the
[1:03:38] family. Brother Andrew asked me to come
[1:03:42] again. I had brother Donnie Reagan meet
[1:03:44] me there.
[1:03:47] Brother Ron had received a diagnosis in
[1:03:49] his eyes that he had cancer in both
[1:03:52] eyes and they would the treatment would
[1:03:57] be they would take one eye out and the
[1:03:59] other they
[1:04:00] would they would treat with
[1:04:06] chemo. Brother Donnie Reagan ministered
[1:04:08] in that meeting. And I also ministered
[1:04:10] in that meeting of the hour has
[1:04:13] come because we had reached a very very
[1:04:16] critical
[1:04:17] hour. Something had to be
[1:04:20] done because
[1:04:22] otherwise he would lose an eye and the
[1:04:26] other perhaps a sight in it also. He
[1:04:29] would not only have cancer but be
[1:04:34] blind. Well, you know what kind of
[1:04:36] diagnosis that is?
[1:04:38] That's very difficult to take. And I
[1:04:41] preached on the hour has come and and I
[1:04:44] said, "The hour has come that we must
[1:04:48] believe." We prayed with him that day
[1:04:51] and he would go back to the doctor and
[1:04:54] spend the whole day going through going
[1:04:56] from one specialist to the other to the
[1:04:58] other. The other said, "We're going to
[1:05:00] Yeah, the cancer is there and this is
[1:05:02] what we're going to do and we'll rem
[1:05:04] we'll set you up a procedure. We're
[1:05:06] going to remove an eyeball today and
[1:05:08] we'll then start a treatment in there.
[1:05:10] Yep. The cancer is all
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:14] there. And he had the last specialist to
[1:05:16] go
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:19] to. Had to wait a few minutes, maybe up
[1:05:22] to an hour
[1:05:24] waiting to see the specialists.
[1:05:28] And in between that last specialist, the
[1:05:30] first of the that one before after
[1:05:33] seeing many that day and coming to the
[1:05:35] last
[1:05:36] one, they would examine his eyes one
[1:05:39] more time, look into it to determine for
[1:05:43] sure what treatments they would
[1:05:45] do, and the specialists would walk back
[1:05:48] in the room and said,
[1:05:49] "Sir, there's been a mistake, a
[1:05:53] confusion.
[1:05:55] You don't have any cancer in those
[1:06:01] eyes. Just from one doctor to another,
[1:06:05] just in a few moments time, the whole
[1:06:08] situation changed. I'm telling you
[1:06:11] tonight, we serve a God that can take
[1:06:14] your situation, no matter how bad it is,
[1:06:17] what the diagnosis is, or how severe the
[1:06:21] situation is in your house or your
[1:06:23] family, and in just a moment's time,
[1:06:27] change it. Change it to say there's none
[1:06:33] there. Well, you know, with cancer in
[1:06:35] his eyes, the tumors must be growing.
[1:06:40] He would go back for
[1:06:42] more visits for the cancer in the brain
[1:06:47] because it had jumped from the lungs to
[1:06:49] the brain. And now he'd actually had
[1:06:52] brain surgery
[1:06:53] before and gammaray
[1:06:57] surgery. And
[1:06:59] [Music]
[1:07:00] then the other day he went to the doctor
[1:07:04] again to the specialist.
[1:07:07] They took it after 30 something
[1:07:11] MRIs, you would walk in here, take one
[1:07:15] more, and the doctor would pronounce,
[1:07:18] "It's a
[1:07:19] miracle. You don't have cancer in your
[1:07:22] brain. The tumors are
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:27] gone." You see, we can walk on
[1:07:31] water and it makes no difference how
[1:07:34] rough it gets. He'll make you where you
[1:07:37] can walk on the waters, the storms in
[1:07:41] your life, whatever the devil has done
[1:07:43] to you, and give you a victory like
[1:07:46] you've never
[1:07:47] known. Now, Brother Ron still has cancer
[1:07:50] in other parts of his body.
[1:07:54] But the same God that removed it from
[1:07:56] the eyes, that removed it from the
[1:07:58] brain, can remove it from the lungs, can
[1:08:02] heal the kidney, can restore his body.
[1:08:06] Amen. He is a restoring God. I want to
[1:08:09] declare tonight, we shall see miracles.
[1:08:12] We shall see fall. We will see it for
[1:08:16] him. We will see it for you because
[1:08:18] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:08:21] today, and forever. Let us believe with
[1:08:24] all our hearts cuz that's what we do.
[1:08:28] We're believers and believers believe.
[1:08:32] As brother Ron comes tonight, let's
[1:08:35] worship the Lord.
[1:08:38] Only believe.
[1:08:44] Only believe.
[1:08:48] All
[1:08:49] things are
[1:08:53] possible
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:09:04] only.
[1:09:06] Only
[1:09:09] believe. All things are possible.
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:17] only believe. Sing it to
[1:09:22] me.
[1:09:25] Lord, I
[1:09:29] believe.
[1:09:31] Lord, I
[1:09:34] believe. All things.
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:53] I
[1:09:56] believe all things are
[1:10:08] possible. Do you love him tonight? Amen.
[1:10:12] Has he touched your heart this week?
[1:10:18] Amen. That's what we come
[1:10:21] for. We shall see miracles.
[1:10:25] We shall see giants
[1:10:29] fall. I don't know if you have a friend
[1:10:31] like Brother
[1:10:35] Tim, but let me just say this to you.
[1:10:38] It's valuable to have a real
[1:10:41] man, a real Christian in your
[1:10:45] corner that'll fight when you don't have
[1:10:48] the
[1:10:48] energies to
[1:10:51] fight.
[1:10:53] Amen. Last year, I stood here and
[1:10:56] preached in this meeting, and I'll just
[1:10:58] share this just before we go to the
[1:11:02] word. And as I preached in this meeting
[1:11:06] uh on a Saturday service like this and
[1:11:09] then we had a prayer
[1:11:13] line. The next morning I wasn't feeling
[1:11:15] so well and I was not able to come to
[1:11:18] the service
[1:11:20] and brother Tim drove me back toward the
[1:11:23] airport
[1:11:25] and and we've been buddies a long time
[1:11:28] and I just didn't feel like hardly even
[1:11:31] talking.
[1:11:34] On Monday, I would get home and I would
[1:11:35] feel okay.
[1:11:37] And then on Tuesday morning, I woke up
[1:11:40] and I knew I was in
[1:11:42] trouble. As the day would progress, my
[1:11:45] chest would begin to almost explode. And
[1:11:48] that night about 9:00, Sister Connie,
[1:11:51] that is such a
[1:11:52] trooper, she said, "I'm calling the
[1:11:54] rescue squad."
[1:11:57] They came and they begin to give me
[1:11:59] nitroglycerin pills.
[1:12:01] And you know, I've just been in youth
[1:12:04] camp. We've just stood in a prayer
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:13] line. They haul me to the
[1:12:17] hospital and I'm in the emergency ward
[1:12:20] and I'm there about an
[1:12:22] hour. They're watching all the signs and
[1:12:26] And in just a few moments, my my room
[1:12:28] flooded with people. A real kind lady
[1:12:32] doctor walked in and she said, "Mr.
[1:12:35] Spencer, I don't want to alarm you, but
[1:12:38] you're having a massive heart
[1:12:42] attack." And as I was being wheeled down
[1:12:44] through the hallways, they told me,
[1:12:46] said, "Would you like to kiss your wife
[1:12:49] one more time?" And I said, "I'll kiss
[1:12:50] her when I get back."
[1:12:53] He said, "Sir, you've got no promise of
[1:12:55] getting
[1:12:56] back." I said, "Oh, yeah. I'm coming
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:11] back." They would begin to stent me, one
[1:13:14] stent after another. Then the doctor
[1:13:17] would look at me and said, "I can't do
[1:13:18] the last one."
[1:13:21] that's in that
[1:13:22] widowmaker and it's in really bad spot.
[1:13:25] And he said, "Mr. Spencer, you're in
[1:13:27] trouble. We're going to ship you to UVA
[1:13:30] where you have your cancer
[1:13:33] treatment." And the next day, they took
[1:13:36] me
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:40] there. They did the treatment. They did
[1:13:42] the stints.
[1:13:43] And then begin to warn me, you you got
[1:13:46] to slow down. You got to kind of take a
[1:13:49] lot of time off. Well, I have. I'm
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:14:05] here. I just share one more thing with
[1:14:07] you.
[1:14:08] And the Lord spoke to me before any of
[1:14:11] these trials came.
[1:14:15] And these words came audible to
[1:14:17] me. If you'll trust
[1:14:20] me, I'll use you like never
[1:14:24] before. I want to report to you, I trust
[1:14:28] him.
[1:14:30] And maybe you don't know him, maybe like
[1:14:33] you should, but he's a
[1:14:36] friend that you can
[1:14:40] trust. cuz he don't know just what you
[1:14:43] went through. He knows that, but he
[1:14:47] knows what you're preparing to go
[1:14:51] through. Will you trust him?
[1:14:54] Brother Ron, I don't know if I can
[1:14:56] believe all that story or not. Well, let
[1:14:58] me share one
[1:15:00] more. Our prophet of the
[1:15:03] age was standing in a
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:07] cave and an angel walked
[1:15:10] in and began to speak to him and told
[1:15:14] him not to
[1:15:16] fear, not to tell it all. But he told
[1:15:19] him, said, "If you can get the people to
[1:15:21] believe,
[1:15:23] not even cancer,
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:28] I'd like to stand and say what that
[1:15:31] angel said is true today."
[1:15:35] Not even
[1:15:39] cancer. Not even
[1:15:44] cancer.
[1:15:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:15:50] Well, you say, "Well, brother Ron, you
[1:15:51] still got cancer." Let me just say, "He
[1:15:53] that hath begun a good work."
[1:15:59] You see, I'm making preparations to ring
[1:16:02] some bells.
[1:16:05] And tell the devil, "You gone,
[1:16:08] [Applause]
[1:16:14] baby." Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] Hallelujah.
[1:16:21] Amen. How many of you would have a need
[1:16:23] in the building tonight? You just like
[1:16:25] to say, "Brother Ron, would you remember
[1:16:28] me?" Now, I want you to I want you to do
[1:16:31] something for me
[1:16:33] now. The presence of the Lord is all
[1:16:36] through this
[1:16:37] building. I want you to invite him where
[1:16:42] he's at. Where you're at.
[1:16:45] Father, come by my
[1:16:47] way. Call your name. Come by my way.
[1:16:51] Meet my need. Now, maybe you're on the
[1:16:55] internet listening. Won't you just
[1:16:57] invite him into your car, in your living
[1:17:00] room, wherever you're at on your
[1:17:02] job, just invite him right
[1:17:05] now. In Jesus name we
[1:17:08] pray. Heavenly Father, we bow our heads
[1:17:11] before you now.
[1:17:14] [Music]
[1:17:16] We ask you to forgive us of our
[1:17:18] sins, our
[1:17:23] mistakes. Father, it will take eternity
[1:17:25] to thank you for what you have done.
[1:17:30] [Music]
[1:17:34] There's no way that I could describe
[1:17:36] everything that we went
[1:17:38] through in the last five
[1:17:41] years. But Father, just to stand here is
[1:17:45] a testimony that must blow Satan's
[1:17:49] mind. Now Lord, we invite you to take
[1:17:52] the throne room of our hearts now and
[1:17:55] come to minister to every need in this
[1:17:58] building.
[1:18:00] and we are taught that our need gets
[1:18:03] your
[1:18:04] attention now. Father, I yield myself to
[1:18:07] you. We ask you to speak to us in a
[1:18:10] special way. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:18:13] name we pray. Amen. Won't you shake your
[1:18:16] neighbor's hand, maybe one or two, and
[1:18:18] say, "I believe it. I believe I'm going
[1:18:20] to get a miracle tonight.
[1:18:37] Hallelujah. I'd like to thank you for
[1:18:39] the opportunity, Brother Tim and Brother
[1:18:41] Timothy, and all the team that's
[1:18:43] here for being able to stand here this
[1:18:47] evening and uh preach with these young
[1:18:51] runners. And wow, what what great
[1:18:53] services we've already had, haven't we?
[1:18:56] It's just been marvelous.
[1:19:05] I know you enjoyed that play this
[1:19:07] morning.
[1:19:09] Oh, wow. I know you enjoyed that play
[1:19:11] this morning. And in a moment, you'll
[1:19:14] know how much I enjoyed that play this
[1:19:17] morning. Amen. Well, let me just go
[1:19:20] ahead and tell you when I walked in and
[1:19:22] saw this set up and knew that I was
[1:19:25] preaching on the man in the arena.
[1:19:34] Listen, no man can put all this
[1:19:36] together. I want you to know that.
[1:19:52] Amen. If you will turn with
[1:19:55] me. If you will just
[1:19:59] Woo. Woo. Help me
[1:20:01] Jesus. If you will turn with me to
[1:20:03] Isaiah 54 and verse 17. I want to
[1:20:08] read the scripture with you. And I would
[1:20:11] like for you to read it with me. It was
[1:20:13] quoted today and I want you to read it
[1:20:16] with me. You know, because words have
[1:20:18] power and especially when it goes from
[1:20:20] your heart across your lips. Amen. You
[1:20:24] will not defeat Satan with your arm
[1:20:26] strength or your leg strength or your
[1:20:28] mind strength, but you'll speak you'll
[1:20:30] defeat him by the spoken word. Amen.
[1:20:36] No
[1:20:39] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[1:20:42] prosper,
[1:20:44] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:20:49] thee, and the judgment thou shalt
[1:20:53] condemn. This is the heritage of the
[1:20:56] servants of the Lord, and their
[1:20:59] righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.
[1:21:02] that you may be
[1:21:06] seated. Philippians chapter 1 and verse
[1:21:09] 6 says, "Being
[1:21:11] confident of this very thing, that he
[1:21:14] which hath begun a good work in
[1:21:18] you will perform it until the day of
[1:21:22] Christ."
[1:21:24] God just don't start a work
[1:21:27] and then quit the work. You see, this
[1:21:30] this work just didn't
[1:21:32] start a couple hundred years ago or
[1:21:36] maybe even a couple thousand years ago.
[1:21:38] This was in the mind of God.
[1:21:42] And and God even created his own enemy.
[1:21:48] Now, he didn't create a enemy.
[1:21:54] He didn't create a mambby pami enemy.
[1:21:58] He created an
[1:22:00] enemy that would help God reflect
[1:22:04] himself.
[1:22:07] The enemy that you fight, you may say,
[1:22:10] "I'm so tormented by him." He is
[1:22:13] supposed to fight you because in his
[1:22:16] fighting, he is bringing character out
[1:22:20] of you. Amen.
[1:22:22] Now, Brother Brandham says many, many
[1:22:25] things and and we can just preface some
[1:22:27] things. You were pre-planned by God.
[1:22:32] He knew what age that you would live in.
[1:22:35] He knew what day that you would arrive.
[1:22:38] He knew how that he would have to equip
[1:22:40] you to fight this enemy.
[1:22:44] He didn't bring you here to be defeated.
[1:22:49] So, it's not a what if or I I just don't
[1:22:52] know if I can hold on. You are built to
[1:22:56] overcome in this day.
[1:23:00] We were we were driving we were driving
[1:23:03] back from dinner today and
[1:23:08] uh Brother Matt Watkins is sitting in
[1:23:11] the back of the vehicle and he said,
[1:23:14] "You know, Brother Tim," he said, "I
[1:23:15] just want to encourage you with some
[1:23:17] words." He said, "God woke me up this
[1:23:19] morning." And he said, he said, he woke
[1:23:22] me up this morning and he said, I sent
[1:23:23] it to my family and we put it on my wall
[1:23:26] and he said, I I I I want to share some
[1:23:29] words with
[1:23:30] you. And it comes from a man that's a
[1:23:32] hero of mine named Teddy
[1:23:37] Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt will speak
[1:23:40] the man in the arena. Teddy Roosevelt
[1:23:43] was quite a he was quite an individual
[1:23:45] and he was almost he could only see
[1:23:47] about 10 foot. So, you know, he couldn't
[1:23:51] play games, he couldn't play ball, so he
[1:23:54] was a
[1:23:56] boxer. And his father knew that he
[1:23:59] needed some inner strength on the inside
[1:24:02] of him, not knowing that he's going to
[1:24:04] be the president of the United States of
[1:24:06] America. And he begin to develop some
[1:24:08] things on the inside of him to fight.
[1:24:12] and and in his fighting and in his in
[1:24:14] his difficulty to
[1:24:17] see, you know, when he came to be the
[1:24:19] president of the United States of
[1:24:21] America, there was something inside of
[1:24:23] him that he wanted to build national
[1:24:25] parks
[1:24:27] that we could
[1:24:29] enjoy. Now, he might not be able to see
[1:24:31] them good, but he was looking for people
[1:24:34] that would be able to see it one day.
[1:24:40] He was getting ready to give a speech
[1:24:42] and it
[1:24:43] was he was
[1:24:45] against he was against
[1:24:49] socialism and he was in a certain place
[1:24:51] and he was getting ready to give the
[1:24:52] speech and an assassin shot him in the
[1:24:57] chest and you know he had to have
[1:24:59] glasses and he had a metal case in his
[1:25:02] pocket and behind that metal
[1:25:04] case he had his speech, the man in the
[1:25:08] arena
[1:25:10] speech, the bullet pierced through the
[1:25:13] metal case and through the through the
[1:25:16] speech and he says, "I've been
[1:25:20] shot." Blood pouring out and running
[1:25:23] down his leg. And they said, "We got to
[1:25:26] take you to the hospital." He said,
[1:25:27] "No, I'm going to give the speech."
[1:25:32] And he stood there for 84 minutes.
[1:25:36] while blood ran down of his chest and
[1:25:39] down his leg and he spoke the man in the
[1:25:43] arena.
[1:25:44] Brother Matt, when you said and you read
[1:25:47] this what I'm getting ready to read this
[1:25:48] morning, I thought my heart was going to
[1:25:52] explode. So, Brother Tim, may this bring
[1:25:55] you courage again
[1:25:59] tonight. He said, "It is not the critic
[1:26:02] that counts.
[1:26:04] It's not the man who points out how that
[1:26:07] the strong man stumbles or whether the
[1:26:10] doer of deeds could have done them
[1:26:13] better. The credit belongs to the man
[1:26:17] who is actually in the arena. Yeah.
[1:26:23] Whose face is marred by dust and sweat
[1:26:26] and blood. Who strives valiantly.
[1:26:30] who errors, who comes short again and
[1:26:36] again because there is no effort without
[1:26:40] error and
[1:26:43] shortcoming. But who does but who does
[1:26:47] actually strive to do the
[1:26:50] deeds? Who knows the great
[1:26:52] enthusiasms, the great devotions, who
[1:26:56] spends himself in a worthy cause? Who is
[1:26:59] at best knows that in the end of
[1:27:02] triumphance and high
[1:27:04] achievement? And who at the worst if he
[1:27:10] fails at least he fails while daring
[1:27:14] greatly?
[1:27:16] So that his place shall never be as
[1:27:20] those cold and timid souls who never
[1:27:24] knew victory nor defeat.
[1:27:33] these services is lined up one right
[1:27:36] after another, one right after
[1:27:38] another. So I just might as well go to
[1:27:41] the next note that was already
[1:27:44] there. And it was
[1:27:46] given by that great ortor that you spoke
[1:27:50] of. and he got to the po uh to the
[1:27:53] podium in his
[1:27:55] microphone and he said, "We shall fight
[1:27:58] on the beaches.
[1:28:01] We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[1:28:03] We shall fight in the fields and in the
[1:28:06] streets. We shall fight in the hills. We
[1:28:10] shall never surrender.
[1:28:16] We will never surrender. We will fight
[1:28:19] for our families. We will fight for our
[1:28:21] children. We will fight for our healing.
[1:28:24] We will fight for deliverance. We will
[1:28:27] fight for joy. We will fight for peace.
[1:28:30] We will fight for the Holy Ghost. We
[1:28:33] will fight until our our bodies are
[1:28:35] changed and we're sitting at the
[1:28:37] marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:48] Psalms chapter 27. Brother Brandham
[1:28:50] would uses that as a rapture
[1:28:53] text. The Lord is my light and my
[1:28:57] salvation. Whom shall I
[1:29:00] fear? The Lord is the strength of my
[1:29:02] life. Of of whom shall I be
[1:29:05] afraid? When the wicked, even mine
[1:29:07] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[1:29:09] my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though
[1:29:12] a host should encamp against me, my
[1:29:15] heart shall not fail. Though war should
[1:29:18] rise against me, in this will I be
[1:29:20] confident. One thing that I have desired
[1:29:22] of the Lord, that will I seek after,
[1:29:25] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:29:27] Lord all the days of my life, to behold
[1:29:30] the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire
[1:29:33] in his temple. For in the time of
[1:29:36] trouble,
[1:29:40] he shall hide me in his pavilion,
[1:29:44] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:29:46] hide me, and he shall set me upon a
[1:29:50] rock.
[1:29:52] The man that writes this, it puts it to
[1:29:55] to song, and we can read it today with
[1:29:58] strength and power. This man knew
[1:30:00] something about battle. Yeah, he knew
[1:30:03] something about war. He knew something
[1:30:06] about having to make sure that he had a
[1:30:09] god on his side
[1:30:12] when brothers would turn against him and
[1:30:14] intimidate him. When nobody, his father
[1:30:17] would forget him. He was a shepherd with
[1:30:21] sheep. Yeah. Now listen, you may have
[1:30:24] had to go through some trials,
[1:30:29] but your trials as you go through and
[1:30:33] overcome prepares you for the next
[1:30:37] trial.
[1:30:41] So draw strength out of the trial as you
[1:30:44] go through it because it you are in
[1:30:48] training.
[1:30:53] Are you with me? You will know how
[1:30:55] strong you are by how strong the
[1:30:58] opponent comes against you.
[1:31:03] Now, David is taking care of
[1:31:07] sheep. Do never let it be just
[1:31:11] poetry that David killed a lion.
[1:31:19] That was no paper tiger.
[1:31:24] That was a beast that had come to not
[1:31:27] only kill
[1:31:29] sheep, but to kill David.
[1:31:32] Let me just say, there's going to be
[1:31:34] some trials that's going to be life and
[1:31:37] death.
[1:31:40] He's sanging the songs. He's in
[1:31:42] preparation. He's in the presence of the
[1:31:44] Lord. And the enemy comes, a
[1:31:48] lion. But that's not going to be the end
[1:31:50] of the story. And then another enemy
[1:31:53] would come, a bear.
[1:31:57] And that bear would come. And it's come
[1:32:00] with a purpose to destroy sheep
[1:32:04] and destroy David the shepherd. The same
[1:32:08] enemy we fight wants to destroy
[1:32:10] churches.
[1:32:12] destroy sheep, destroy shepherds,
[1:32:16] but the God that we serve
[1:32:20] in the time of trouble, he's going to be
[1:32:23] with us. He's made us a promise. I'll
[1:32:27] never leave you. I'll never forsake you.
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:32] Hallelujah.
[1:32:35] You know the story better than I do even
[1:32:37] now.
[1:32:40] He gets beckoned. There's a war going
[1:32:42] on.
[1:32:44] The war is going on and it seems hot in
[1:32:48] battle. He's been asked to take food to
[1:32:50] the battle. Yeah.
[1:32:54] Now, I want you to
[1:32:56] understand all of his brothers couldn't
[1:32:59] step into the arena.
[1:33:02] The king couldn't step into the arena.
[1:33:06] Listen, when the enemy is so big and so
[1:33:08] loud and so boisterous.
[1:33:13] Even the enemy knows his competition
[1:33:17] and he know I'm as safe as I can be.
[1:33:19] None of that backsliding church is
[1:33:21] coming.
[1:33:23] But just let him keep screaming. That's
[1:33:25] right.
[1:33:27] He just keeps screaming until it falls
[1:33:30] on the ears of somebody that would take
[1:33:34] him on.
[1:33:37] He can scream to denominations. He can
[1:33:40] scream to your worldly friends. But just
[1:33:42] let the enemy scream in your ear. That's
[1:33:46] when he's in trouble.
[1:33:51] Hallelujah.
[1:33:53] Well, brother Ron, you know, I'm not
[1:33:55] much. I I'm not big. I I'm not strong.
[1:33:58] You know, listen to David's brothers.
[1:34:02] When he shows up at battle, they begin
[1:34:04] to make fun of him. Why aren't you back
[1:34:06] there taking care of this
[1:34:07] sheep? They wasn't even thankful that he
[1:34:10] brought them
[1:34:14] lunch. And he began to ask them, "Who is
[1:34:17] that uncircumcised for listening that's
[1:34:21] defying the armies of the living God?
[1:34:25] Why isn't somebody stepped up to the
[1:34:28] battle?
[1:34:31] Why isn't
[1:34:33] somebody? There's got to be somebody
[1:34:35] that's going to be the bride of Jesus
[1:34:37] Christ.
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:41] There's been churches and churches and
[1:34:43] brides. Brides, surely there's going to
[1:34:46] come one.
[1:34:48] That's right.
[1:34:51] The words came to to
[1:34:54] Saul that there's a there's a
[1:34:58] boy there's a boy that says, "I'm
[1:35:01] willing to fight."
[1:35:04] You know what he did? called him up
[1:35:06] there and he began to ask him questions
[1:35:09] and begin to go through
[1:35:11] things. David didn't give him some long
[1:35:14] sermon.
[1:35:18] He just started having a testimony
[1:35:20] service.
[1:35:23] He just started having a testimony
[1:35:25] service. Now listen, when you feel that
[1:35:28] cold devil start coming around you and
[1:35:29] the the clouds of depression start
[1:35:32] coming around you and the friends start
[1:35:34] turning you down, just start having a
[1:35:36] testimony service.
[1:35:39] Just go back and tell him what God's
[1:35:41] done for you.
[1:35:43] Listen, you don't have to embellish it.
[1:35:46] Just tell what God's done for you. When
[1:35:49] you start talking about God, God comes
[1:35:52] on the scene. Amen.
[1:35:56] Now, I I want you to understand that
[1:36:00] David knew exactly where he was
[1:36:02] at because he knew he had a living God.
[1:36:06] That's right.
[1:36:08] You got to know that you know that you
[1:36:11] know that you know, brother Ron, how can
[1:36:14] you guys stand in the pull pit like
[1:36:16] Brother Tim and Brother Matt and Brother
[1:36:18] Matt and Brother Kelly and these other
[1:36:19] ministers that are here? How can you
[1:36:21] stand so confidently? We had a prophet
[1:36:25] that was also a boxer
[1:36:29] and God trained him in as a boxer and
[1:36:32] then took him by the word of God and he
[1:36:34] was going to stand night after night
[1:36:36] after night after night after night with
[1:36:40] the devil in his face. But he knew where
[1:36:43] he was at.
[1:36:45] [Applause]
[1:36:50] David did not walk off of that hill
[1:36:52] thinking I'm going to die.
[1:36:55] He did not walk off that hill thinking,
[1:36:57] I I hope they build a nice monument for
[1:37:00] me. No, I I hope they write a song about
[1:37:05] me. He got down to the bottom of the
[1:37:07] hill and he picked up
[1:37:10] five smooth stones.
[1:37:17] before before we started this
[1:37:20] battle in November.
[1:37:24] We were having brother Kelly to
[1:37:28] come and brother Kelly's brother flew a
[1:37:31] different flight. He arrived
[1:37:33] early and brother
[1:37:36] Kelly he came
[1:37:38] and he's not there that
[1:37:41] day. And so then the next night instead
[1:37:45] of cancelling the service I spoke and
[1:37:48] God spoke to me and said preach a sermon
[1:37:50] called don't worry.
[1:37:54] And then brother Kelly was supposed to
[1:37:56] be there the next morning and was
[1:37:58] supposed to have service the next
[1:37:59] morning. He wasn't going to arrive until
[1:38:02] about about midm morning and we had to
[1:38:05] drive a couple hours to pick him
[1:38:09] up. I didn't know. But I told the
[1:38:11] audience, I said, "I don't know what
[1:38:13] Brother Kelly's going to
[1:38:16] preach, but I'll tell you this. Satan's
[1:38:20] trying to stop him from delivering the
[1:38:23] message.
[1:38:27] When brother Kelly that afternoon we had
[1:38:30] service and brother Kelly walks to the
[1:38:32] pullpit, he doesn't tell me just like I
[1:38:35] didn't tell you guys. He walks to the
[1:38:38] pull pit and he he had a
[1:38:41] coin. It was a commemorative
[1:38:43] coin. It was a coin of
[1:38:46] D-Day.
[1:38:49] And and on that coin, it had a piece of
[1:38:52] sand. One grain of sand in this plastic
[1:38:56] package glued to
[1:39:03] it. And the saying on that coin said,
[1:39:07] "We will not accept
[1:39:11] anything but total victory." Amen.
[1:39:17] And he turned to me and he said,
[1:39:18] "Brother Ron, I've come to bring you
[1:39:21] this coin."
[1:39:24] Brother Tim had been to
[1:39:28] Israel. And when he was in that place
[1:39:31] where David picked up those
[1:39:34] rocks, he picked up five stones for
[1:39:38] me. I'm sorry, this wasn't in my notes,
[1:39:40] but here we are.
[1:39:43] And there was a young man in my church
[1:39:45] that wanted to build me a rifle, a
[1:39:47] special rifle, about a $5,000 rifle. And
[1:39:50] I said, "No, I I I don't want you to
[1:39:51] build me a rifle. I I I don't need that.
[1:39:53] I I've got guns and uh I believe in the
[1:39:57] Second
[1:40:01] Amendment." And and I I I said, "I I've
[1:40:04] got plenty of guns. I I don't want you
[1:40:06] to take your money to do that. I I thank
[1:40:08] you for the gift and uh but I don't want
[1:40:10] you to do that. On the
[1:40:13] night that we were to announce to our
[1:40:17] audience that cancer had struck our body
[1:40:20] and the doctors is telling us that we
[1:40:22] had cancer. That young man walked into
[1:40:25] my study and he said,
[1:40:27] "Brother, instead of buying you a gun, I
[1:40:31] bought you a slingshot."
[1:40:36] So now I've got a slingshot to go with
[1:40:39] some rocks
[1:40:45] because God was preparing us for battle.
[1:40:52] Somehow you have been selected to be the
[1:40:56] man in the arena in your life.
[1:41:00] Every one of us fight different things
[1:41:02] in your life. But let me just say this
[1:41:05] you God does not leave you.
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:12] Brother Brand says in a contest he said
[1:41:14] a contest is a test of strength.
[1:41:20] Where we have the
[1:41:22] strength. We got to have our strength
[1:41:26] tested.
[1:41:28] He would give an illustration about
[1:41:30] Indians and how they would young
[1:41:33] warriors would would have a long rope
[1:41:36] and they tested their strength by trying
[1:41:38] to pull the other one over into the
[1:41:42] fire. So tonight I want to say let's
[1:41:44] pull Satan right back to hell where he's
[1:41:47] supposed to be at.
[1:41:57] Brother Ram said,
[1:41:59] "Satan is powerless.
[1:42:04] He's
[1:42:05] powerless toward this bride of Jesus
[1:42:07] Christ." That's quite a statement, but
[1:42:10] you got to remind him. Not just your
[1:42:13] favorite preacher, but you've got to
[1:42:15] remind him.
[1:42:17] Brother Random would say this. He said,
[1:42:18] "I was going into a football stadium one
[1:42:21] day and I seen this little sign hanging
[1:42:24] on the wall. It always struck
[1:42:27] me. It said, "Brother Joe, we can
[1:42:30] appreciate this. It's not the size of
[1:42:33] the dog that's in the fight.
[1:42:37] It's a size of the fight
[1:42:41] that's in the dog.
[1:42:53] Brother says, he said, "It's a
[1:42:55] battle. You got to know your
[1:42:57] enemy. You've got to know your armor."
[1:43:01] And your armor is the word. Your enemy
[1:43:04] is something that'll reason against it.
[1:43:07] Let's just go back to the word for a
[1:43:08] moment. Since a child, you know this,
[1:43:11] the Lord is my shepherd.
[1:43:14] I shall not want. He maketh me to lie
[1:43:18] down in green pastures, and he leadeth
[1:43:19] me beside of the still waters. He
[1:43:22] restoth my soul. He leadth me in the
[1:43:24] path of righteous for his name's sake.
[1:43:26] And yay, though I walk through the
[1:43:28] valley of the shadow of death. I will
[1:43:31] fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy
[1:43:34] rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou
[1:43:37] preparest a table before me in the
[1:43:40] presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest
[1:43:43] my head with oil. My cup runth over.
[1:43:45] Let's say it together. Surely goodness
[1:43:48] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[1:43:50] of my life. And I will dwell in the
[1:43:53] house of the Lord forever.
[1:43:57] Brother Brandham, the greatest battle
[1:43:59] ever fought would talk about a man named
[1:44:00] Peter Cartwright.
[1:44:04] This last
[1:44:07] November, I was able to visit his grave.
[1:44:11] and he's been another kind of
[1:44:13] hero of mine and I stood beside of his
[1:44:17] grave and thank the Lord for him.
[1:44:19] Brother Bram would talk about him
[1:44:22] and how that he would go into a town
[1:44:24] just to re refresh your memory. He'd go
[1:44:27] into a town and and he was going to have
[1:44:30] a revival there. you know, he's, you
[1:44:33] know, he's come to have a revival and,
[1:44:35] uh, you know, he feels led to be there.
[1:44:37] And, and the town
[1:44:40] bully, you heard this before. Yeah.
[1:44:43] Well, it's right here in the notes, too.
[1:44:45] And the town bully says,
[1:44:48] "Hey, what are you doing?" He said, "I'm
[1:44:50] going to have a revival here." He said,
[1:44:52] "You can't have a revival
[1:44:54] here. The first thing you're going to
[1:44:56] have to do is whip me."
[1:44:58] Brother Brandham said he was cleaning
[1:45:00] the windows of the building and he said,
[1:45:04] "Well," he just started climbing down
[1:45:06] off of the ladder and rolled his sleeves
[1:45:08] up and he said, "Well, I'll do that next
[1:45:10] then." And he jumped on the man and
[1:45:12] pummeled him.
[1:45:20] Well, that's just one story. Well, I
[1:45:22] don't know if you know it or not, but
[1:45:24] Peter Cartright was a politician.
[1:45:27] He ran and he was quite a leader in the
[1:45:30] state of
[1:45:31] Illinois. One of his competitors was a
[1:45:34] man named Abraham Lincoln.
[1:45:37] Peter Cartright was such an
[1:45:40] orator said he was such a great orator
[1:45:42] until Abraham Lincoln didn't stand a
[1:45:45] chance and he won the race against
[1:45:48] Abraham
[1:45:49] Lincoln. There was another man. They
[1:45:51] would go from town square to town
[1:45:54] squares giving their speeches and this
[1:45:57] links in where I'm going. And they're
[1:45:59] giving their speeches and his
[1:46:02] opponent is standing up and he's talking
[1:46:06] all the kind of nonsense about Peter
[1:46:08] Cartwright.
[1:46:11] And Peter Cartrray just stands and with
[1:46:14] the hundreds of people standing there
[1:46:15] and he just stands and listens to this
[1:46:18] man give a speech and he's screaming,
[1:46:21] "Oh, if Peter Clay was here, I'd whip
[1:46:25] him. I'd pumble him to the ground. I'd
[1:46:28] destroy him. I'd show you what a whimp
[1:46:33] is." Toward the end of the speech, Peter
[1:46:36] Claright said, "Do you know who he is?
[1:46:44] And he said, "No, I've never laid my
[1:46:46] eyes on him." And he said, "I'm Peter
[1:46:49] Cartwright."
[1:46:52] He said, "Now you've got the opportunity
[1:46:55] to come down off of that stage."
[1:46:58] And to prove to these people that you
[1:47:01] can do what you said you can do.
[1:47:06] If not, you're a liar. And Only you
[1:47:10] people know that this man is a liar.
[1:47:15] Well, the man jumped down off of the
[1:47:17] stage
[1:47:19] embarrassed. Now he's got to face Peter
[1:47:21] Clark, right? Well, yes, Peter Clark
[1:47:24] right whipped
[1:47:25] him. How did you expect this to
[1:47:29] end? But there was a river down across
[1:47:32] the street and Peter Cartwright
[1:47:35] announced, "I'm a preacher and I believe
[1:47:37] in baptizing.
[1:47:40] And he said, "I'm going to baptize this
[1:47:42] man because he needs it. And I'm going
[1:47:44] to baptize the devil that's inside of
[1:47:48] [Applause]
[1:47:59] him." Now, I want you to understand that
[1:48:02] the word of
[1:48:03] God is superior to all of your feelings.
[1:48:11] You heard it. Make a t-shirt up.
[1:48:19] Well, I want you to know the word of God
[1:48:21] is superior to all of your feelings.
[1:48:25] You heard it as you come in to just, you
[1:48:28] know, maybe you didn't get the right
[1:48:29] bump, maybe you didn't get the right
[1:48:31] counselor, maybe you wasn't with the
[1:48:33] best friend. And and you know, you knew
[1:48:35] that you was the person that he was
[1:48:37] talking about.
[1:48:39] God knows how to find you in a service.
[1:48:43] That's right.
[1:48:46] You walked into this the stage today and
[1:48:49] and they begin to explain boxing and you
[1:48:51] say, "Well, what what on earth does
[1:48:55] boxing have to do with with these
[1:48:59] services?" Well, these next few quotes
[1:49:02] are in my notes before I ever got here,
[1:49:06] so I might as well read them. What do
[1:49:07] you think?
[1:49:09] Brother Brim says, "And you know your
[1:49:12] enemy." He says, "And train for the
[1:49:15] contest that's going to have when you go
[1:49:19] and meet him because you're going to
[1:49:21] meet him and know him and know and know
[1:49:25] what his strength is and train for this
[1:49:28] contest. And when you do meet him, for
[1:49:31] it's one thing for sure, you're going to
[1:49:34] meet him."
[1:49:36] So you train for the contest.
[1:49:41] Now training for a contest is is just
[1:49:43] like a boxer. His enemy that he's going
[1:49:47] to meet out there in the contest to
[1:49:50] fight. A really good fighter usually
[1:49:53] knows and studies his opponent. He
[1:49:55] studies his licks. He knows where he's
[1:49:58] fighting for. He knows where to lean
[1:50:01] forward, hang back. He fights
[1:50:04] right-handed or he fights left-handed.
[1:50:06] He studies all of this and then if he's
[1:50:10] good and he's a smart
[1:50:12] fighter, he gets him a sparring partner
[1:50:18] that'll fight like his opponent fights
[1:50:21] and for he'll know all of his licks when
[1:50:26] you get to that place.
[1:50:29] Next quote. He said, "When I first
[1:50:32] started training for boxing, I got in
[1:50:35] professional fighting. There used to be
[1:50:37] a trainer, they called him sixcond
[1:50:40] Smith."
[1:50:44] Remember, Brother Brand said he'd just
[1:50:46] about knock him out of the ring and
[1:50:47] knock other people out of the ring. And
[1:50:50] he said, and I
[1:50:51] said, "Six, why do you have to do that
[1:50:55] to
[1:50:56] me? You just knocked the breath out of
[1:50:59] me, man. And I went I went plum over the
[1:51:02] ropes. Come out of there and then
[1:51:05] against them chairs and and like I broke
[1:51:08] my back on them. He laughed and he said,
[1:51:11] "That'll do you good."
[1:51:14] I said, "Do me good. How can it do me
[1:51:18] good? You're about to kill me." And he
[1:51:22] said, "Look, Billy, I don't care how
[1:51:25] physically fit you are. Your body has
[1:51:28] got to be able to stand and come back.
[1:51:35] Come
[1:51:36] back. If you can take that punch, if
[1:51:39] your body's not used to it, coming back,
[1:51:43] you'll lay there and take the count. Am
[1:51:45] I preaching to you?
[1:51:48] Am I getting to you?
[1:51:50] You got to be ready to take the punch
[1:51:53] cuz the punch is coming.
[1:51:58] But if your body's used to it to taking
[1:52:01] it, then it's going to come back. And
[1:52:04] every time you get hit, that shocks your
[1:52:08] blood and runs it back to your heart. He
[1:52:12] said, "If you do that, then your body is
[1:52:15] used to coming back quick." When you get
[1:52:18] knocked down, Brother Brown Knight snaps
[1:52:20] his fingers on your feet again.
[1:52:25] Yeah, it's no shame in getting knocked
[1:52:27] down. Get up.
[1:52:31] Brother, but I've been knocked down. I
[1:52:32] got all these issues. Get up.
[1:52:35] Get up.
[1:52:40] That don't mean nothing to get knocked
[1:52:43] down up on your feet again.
[1:52:46] Said, "You may hate me now, but you'll
[1:52:49] appreciate me when you get out there in
[1:52:52] the ring." And he said, That was right.
[1:52:57] You remember, Brother Brandon was
[1:52:59] undefeated
[1:53:01] as a professional boxer.
[1:53:04] So, he learned what he had to do while
[1:53:07] he was training.
[1:53:12] He said, "Brother, sometime I I'd have
[1:53:14] to not to to see who who would have
[1:53:18] wouldn't have it, but but I found
[1:53:21] something. Don't baby them.
[1:53:24] Pour it on.
[1:53:28] You'll appreciate me when you come to
[1:53:31] Calvary.
[1:53:33] Oh, brother Ron, brother Brandon
[1:53:34] preaches so hard. Jezebel religion,
[1:53:37] you'll appreciate him.
[1:53:40] Hybrid religion, you'll appreciate him.
[1:53:42] Things that are to be, you'll appreciate
[1:53:44] him. Possessing the enemy gates, you'll
[1:53:47] appreciate him. But brother, he burned
[1:53:51] my hide so much. My pastor burns my
[1:53:54] heart so much. You'll appreciate him.
[1:54:05] See, what you've got to do is look past
[1:54:07] the vessel.
[1:54:10] You got to look past the vessel that's
[1:54:11] speaking to you. That's right. Many
[1:54:14] years ago, I learned
[1:54:16] this in a sermon. Whether it's 45
[1:54:19] minutes or two hours, I look for one
[1:54:23] sentence that'll speak to my heart
[1:54:27] because I know that minister has studied
[1:54:30] to show himself approved. He's laid time
[1:54:33] out to get prepared for the meeting.
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:38] And God wants to talk through that
[1:54:40] vessel to you.
[1:54:42] And if you can just get yourself out of
[1:54:44] the way just a little while and grab a
[1:54:47] hold of that word of God,
[1:54:51] [Applause]
[1:54:55] you'll appreciate them at the end of the
[1:54:57] road.
[1:54:59] Brother B says, "Why does God let
[1:55:01] troubles come?" Believe we could all ask
[1:55:04] that sometimes.
[1:55:05] God harnesses troubles
[1:55:09] and puts bits in its mouth and makes it
[1:55:12] obey him. Notice these next words. For
[1:55:16] those troubles bring us into closer
[1:55:19] fellowship.
[1:55:23] To God
[1:55:30] I got this and I I shared it before. I
[1:55:32] went I want to share it tonight.
[1:55:35] I asked
[1:55:36] God, "Why are you taking me through the
[1:55:40] water?" And he replied, "Because your
[1:55:44] enemies can't swim."
[1:55:52] I want you to understand, God just
[1:55:53] didn't build you to see if he could do
[1:55:56] it.
[1:55:58] Can I preach to you just for a little
[1:56:00] bit?
[1:56:01] God just don't make a tree to see if he
[1:56:03] can make a tree.
[1:56:05] He just don't make an ocean just to see
[1:56:06] if he can make it. You are no accident
[1:56:10] with God.
[1:56:13] You are no accident with God. Sharon,
[1:56:16] would you stand up there just for a
[1:56:17] moment? Sharon is a young man that I've
[1:56:19] known City since he was a
[1:56:22] boy. Sharon's got a phenomenal testimony
[1:56:25] if you got time to listen to it
[1:56:26] sometime.
[1:56:27] Brother
[1:56:30] Sharon, he came to this meeting. He
[1:56:33] drove by
[1:56:35] himself 1,900
[1:56:38] miles. When he left the other day, he
[1:56:41] sent me a note. I'm getting ready to
[1:56:42] leave. I left my grandparents place. And
[1:56:45] and I told him I was coming and and he
[1:56:48] got in the car and I told him, I said,
[1:56:50] "Keep me posted as you're going." And he
[1:56:53] asked me, he said, "Brother Ron, what
[1:56:55] sermons should I listen to while I'm
[1:56:57] while I'm
[1:56:58] traveling?" You know, not what song
[1:57:03] or what sermons
[1:57:06] cuz he was feeding.
[1:57:10] You think, "Well, I'm just driving and
[1:57:12] it's just background noise." No, it's
[1:57:13] not background noise.
[1:57:16] It's preparing you for a fight.
[1:57:23] Now you see this young man is incredible
[1:57:25] musicians. Now let me just say this to
[1:57:28] you. In his
[1:57:29] preparation, he has to be able to tell
[1:57:31] the devil, "Nope, I'm not selling my
[1:57:34] gift to nobody."
[1:57:38] And maybe he would get an offer $10
[1:57:39] million to play in some rock group or
[1:57:42] some some western country group or some
[1:57:45] of these other groups. Let me just say
[1:57:47] playing on a stage for the bride of
[1:57:50] Jesus Christ gives you top
[1:58:01] dollar. So Sharon's a good-looking chap.
[1:58:04] He's available. He's got
[1:58:06] money. He's come to this juke camp for a
[1:58:09] couple of years. It doesn't seem to be
[1:58:10] working. But you know, one day, one day,
[1:58:13] one day.
[1:58:16] But God just didn't make him nicel
[1:58:20] looking. He just didn't make him tall
[1:58:23] and
[1:58:24] handsome, certain color
[1:58:26] hair, certain color eyes, just to see if
[1:58:30] he could do it. Your brother's ribbing
[1:58:31] you right now. I know it is. And he can
[1:58:34] just be thankful to God I didn't call
[1:58:36] him
[1:58:39] up.
[1:58:41] And God just
[1:58:43] doesn't watch over the DNA since Adam to
[1:58:47] get you here
[1:58:50] just to see if he can do it.
[1:58:54] You're born a certain weight. You're,
[1:58:56] you know, you're you're you're about
[1:58:58] that long. You know, in those crazy
[1:59:00] measurements in
[1:59:03] Canada, you begin to grow and you begin
[1:59:06] to be what little boys do and then what
[1:59:08] teenagers do. and you go through your
[1:59:10] rebellious stage and all of a sudden God
[1:59:12] begins to deal with your heart and you
[1:59:14] begin to get pulled toward God turning
[1:59:17] down the world
[1:59:19] because God's got a purpose in your
[1:59:22] life.
[1:59:24] Amen. Are you with me? I'm not just
[1:59:26] talking to him. I'm talking to all of
[1:59:28] you. He's got a purpose in your life.
[1:59:32] He took a photo of you before the
[1:59:34] foundation of the world. He just didn't
[1:59:36] do it to see if he could do it.
[1:59:39] He's got a purpose.
[1:59:41] [Applause]
[1:59:48] Now, in serving the
[1:59:51] purpose, you have been raised in the
[1:59:54] message. Being raised in the message,
[1:59:56] you've got a PhD
[1:59:58] degree of hearing all the sermons
[2:00:01] through all the
[2:00:02] years. But Satan's not impressed with
[2:00:06] that.
[2:00:08] He's really He's really not impressed
[2:00:10] with that. Being a good musician, he's
[2:00:13] not so impressed with that. Driving a
[2:00:17] car fast and getting a ticket, he's not
[2:00:19] impressed with that. Having a good job
[2:00:22] and making money, he's not impressed
[2:00:24] with that. But I tell you what turns his
[2:00:26] head
[2:00:29] when you take this word of God and you
[2:00:31] make it live.
[2:00:42] And Satan has done everything that he
[2:00:44] can to stop you over and over and over
[2:00:46] and over and over again. But you took
[2:00:49] the word of God and kept marching and
[2:00:52] kept marching and kept marching. There
[2:00:54] were days that you didn't feel like it.
[2:00:56] There was days you feel like quitting.
[2:00:58] There was days you felt like turning
[2:01:00] around, but you kept marching.
[2:01:12] Why, brother? He
[2:01:14] recognize I'm the man
[2:01:18] in the arena.
[2:01:21] Thank you. Does he have scoffers? Sure
[2:01:24] he does.
[2:01:28] I know his story. Does he have family
[2:01:31] that makes fun of him? Sure he does.
[2:01:34] But he's a man in the arena.
[2:01:37] Let your scoffers scoff.
[2:01:40] They're not going to do anything anyway.
[2:01:45] Brother Ron, but Facebook just tears me
[2:01:47] all to pieces. So what?
[2:01:50] They are as close to heaven as they'll
[2:01:52] ever get.
[2:01:54] But you are as close to hell as you'll
[2:01:57] ever get.
[2:01:59] [Applause]
[2:02:06] Now, Brother Brandham said this. He
[2:02:09] said, "I'm so
[2:02:11] glad I love this quote. I'm so glad that
[2:02:17] a man can so completely serve God
[2:02:21] till the devil don't know what to do
[2:02:24] with him." Amen.
[2:02:30] I want to read it again to
[2:02:32] you. I'm so glad that a man can so
[2:02:37] completely serve God until the
[2:02:41] devil. Don't know what to do with him.
[2:02:45] Brother, I haven't done anything
[2:02:47] supernatural being here.
[2:02:53] being here. Tell your neighbor right
[2:02:55] now, I am a miracle just to be here.
[2:03:06] Just so you get it, tell your other
[2:03:08] neighbor, I am a
[2:03:14] miracle, brother. I've never seen a
[2:03:16] miracle. You just witnessed to one and
[2:03:20] then you turned your head and witnessed
[2:03:22] to another
[2:03:33] one. This is what was in my notes. So,
[2:03:36] you know, here we are.
[2:03:40] Now, you know, you do not
[2:03:43] know even what your best friend's going
[2:03:47] through
[2:03:49] at the moment. They're here, but they've
[2:03:53] they have been going through stuff all
[2:03:55] week. They have been fighting and
[2:03:58] fighting and fighting and the clouds got
[2:04:01] darker and darker and darker. Oh,
[2:04:04] brother Ron, but that's just for us guys
[2:04:05] in the pew. What about the preachers?
[2:04:08] What about the guys that preached to you
[2:04:10] the last couple of days? You don't know
[2:04:13] the difficulty that the devil tried to
[2:04:15] stop them with. I don't know it, but I
[2:04:17] know I know how Satan works. He will do
[2:04:20] his best
[2:04:23] cuz he knows that they are the men in
[2:04:26] the arena.
[2:04:28] They're going to speak something
[2:04:30] supernatural to God's children.
[2:04:36] Now,
[2:04:39] You heard it mentioned today of a man
[2:04:41] named Muhammad Ali.
[2:04:47] I'm just going to share something real
[2:04:50] carnal here. He was one of my favorite
[2:04:55] boxers and you heard it today. Uh, flow
[2:04:58] like a butterfly, sting like a
[2:05:01] bee. I'm Muhammad Ali.
[2:05:05] And he had a a thing that he did called
[2:05:08] it rope a dope. He would back up and put
[2:05:11] his his gloves over his face and he back
[2:05:14] into the corner and his opponent would
[2:05:17] just beat him and beat him and beat him
[2:05:21] and beat him and he would stick his head
[2:05:25] out and go, "Is that all you got?"
[2:05:33] I want you to look at the devil and say,
[2:05:35] "Is that all you got?"
[2:05:50] Now, Muhammad Ali was champion over and
[2:05:51] over again, but he too got knocked down.
[2:05:55] He he too he too got whipped
[2:05:59] bad. He had a trainer named Angelo
[2:06:02] Dundee. Angelo Dundee called it the the
[2:06:05] House of
[2:06:07] Horrors. When you get so hit so
[2:06:10] hard till that hit hits you to where
[2:06:14] that you lose your thinking of who you
[2:06:17] are, where you are, even where the
[2:06:20] opponent is in front of you. You lose
[2:06:23] your senses. your arms go numb and your
[2:06:25] legs go numb, your mind gets
[2:06:28] fuzzy. And it's a called, it's a boxing
[2:06:30] term called
[2:06:35] househares. And now after he's coming
[2:06:38] out of the ring after being
[2:06:41] whipped, he said, "You got to do
[2:06:43] whatever you got to do to get me through
[2:06:46] the house of horrors."
[2:06:50] Because we as Christians are going to
[2:06:53] get knocked.
[2:06:57] We're going to get knocked
[2:07:00] because there's punches coming. Some of
[2:07:02] you are not going to see coming, but
[2:07:05] we're going to get knocked to a place of
[2:07:08] the house of horrors of our lives.
[2:07:14] So they brought in sparring partners
[2:07:16] after sparring partners to hit him,
[2:07:20] knock
[2:07:21] him. One day he said, "You've got to get
[2:07:25] me
[2:07:26] somebody that won't just play,
[2:07:29] but that will knock me out. so I can get
[2:07:32] my way through it cuz I've got to be the
[2:07:35] champion again.
[2:07:39] Listen, training, reading your Bible,
[2:07:41] and praying,
[2:07:44] testifying, it's hard work sometimes,
[2:07:49] but it'll do you good.
[2:08:00] This man entered the
[2:08:02] ring and the first thing he asked him
[2:08:04] said, "Are you afraid of
[2:08:07] me?" He said, "No, Mr. Ali, I'm not
[2:08:11] afraid of you." He said,
[2:08:13] "Good. You're the opponent that I've
[2:08:16] been looking for."
[2:08:19] You see, the devil's not scared of you,
[2:08:25] but he's scared of who you represent.
[2:08:33] Day after day, this man would knock him
[2:08:35] and beat him, knock him down,
[2:08:39] knock him
[2:08:41] out. Dundee would tell him, said, "You
[2:08:44] got to get through it.
[2:08:46] Don't just take the punch and lay there.
[2:08:49] You got to get through it.
[2:08:52] You got to get up. Get the inner man
[2:08:55] fighting.
[2:08:57] You got to fight.
[2:09:02] You've got to fight.
[2:09:05] You're not looking for 15 people to come
[2:09:07] help you. You got to fight.
[2:09:12] You got to fight. Don't quit.
[2:09:17] Don't quit.
[2:09:20] Doctor after doctors asked me, "Are you
[2:09:22] ready to quit?" "No, sir."
[2:09:25] And if I don't answer him quick enough,
[2:09:27] my wife said, "We're not quitting."
[2:09:32] [Music]
[2:09:37] Finally, the rematch
[2:09:41] came. He stepped into the ring.
[2:09:45] And in the ring, he met the man that had
[2:09:47] knocked him into that
[2:09:49] room.
[2:09:51] Today, he had to respect him, but he had
[2:09:55] to believe when this bout is over, I'm
[2:09:59] going to win.
[2:10:02] His wife wasn't in the ring with him.
[2:10:04] His managers wasn't in the ring with
[2:10:06] him.
[2:10:08] His best friends was not in the ring
[2:10:10] with him. It was
[2:10:12] him. Am I driving it? Is it Are you
[2:10:15] getting it?
[2:10:17] Brother Ron, I'm so alone. We're
[2:10:19] supposed to be
[2:10:22] We're supposed to be Thank God that we
[2:10:24] got hundreds and hundreds of friends all
[2:10:25] over the world. But let me just say this
[2:10:27] to you. You got to fight the devil. At
[2:10:30] the greatest battle of your mind,
[2:10:34] you've got to take the word, put it upon
[2:10:36] your lips, quote the word. Amen. You got
[2:10:40] to know that you know that you know that
[2:10:42] you have the token applied on your life.
[2:10:47] And when you would give up, he's on the
[2:10:49] inside of you.
[2:10:55] We're preaching to somebody. I know I
[2:10:57] am. I know I am.
[2:11:02] That
[2:11:03] evening, that boxer did the same thing
[2:11:05] that he did before.
[2:11:08] And when he got in the ropes, the man
[2:11:10] knocked him and he went
[2:11:13] blind. He became confused. He felt his
[2:11:16] arms trying to droop. He felt his legs
[2:11:19] trying to droop. And he
[2:11:23] remembered like a man named Samson.
[2:11:26] Yeah.
[2:11:28] If I can only come to myself,
[2:11:34] if I can only come to myself, I won't
[2:11:37] have to be at this grinding meal much
[2:11:39] longer.
[2:11:41] They may have put out my eyes. They may
[2:11:43] have cut my hair off. They may have took
[2:11:46] me and I've lost my identity. But I am a
[2:11:49] son of Abraham.
[2:12:02] The bell
[2:12:04] rings, he finds him way to the
[2:12:07] corner. Maybe we would call it a Sunday
[2:12:10] morning
[2:12:12] service and your corner
[2:12:15] man gets in your face and starts
[2:12:18] screaming in your ear.
[2:12:22] He don't tell him how to box.
[2:12:26] He knows how to do that.
[2:12:28] He don't tell him what to do.
[2:12:31] He reminds him who he is.
[2:12:37] That's what we do as preachers.
[2:12:39] [Applause]
[2:12:40] There's a God that's on the inside of
[2:12:42] you knows how to fight.
[2:12:48] There's a Holy Ghost down on the inside
[2:12:50] of you that's greater than he that is in
[2:12:52] you, than he that is in the world.
[2:12:57] God will fight your battles for you.
[2:13:06] But children of God, if you can just
[2:13:08] shake yourself,
[2:13:11] shake yourself,
[2:13:13] shake yourself and say, "This is my
[2:13:15] night.
[2:13:18] This is my moment.
[2:13:21] This is my hour.
[2:13:24] I am the man in the arena.
[2:13:38] I'm not I'm not Angelo Dundee, but I'm
[2:13:42] going to borrow his words. He whispered
[2:13:44] into his
[2:13:46] ears. You are a champion.
[2:13:52] You are a champion.
[2:13:56] Act like it.
[2:14:04] No doubt brother Brandham could remember
[2:14:07] 6 seconds Smith
[2:14:10] knocking him out of the ring
[2:14:12] beat him
[2:14:16] in the
[2:14:17] moment it seemed horrendous
[2:14:21] falling off a house and they say you'll
[2:14:23] never walk again getting hit by
[2:14:25] lightning
[2:14:30] write a book one day
[2:14:33] getting burned in a fire and they said
[2:14:35] I'd never live through it
[2:14:39] and I had a buddy
[2:14:41] come and Angelo Dundee stood in my room
[2:14:45] and said I didn't come to preach a
[2:14:47] funeral.
[2:14:51] I'll tell you what his words was. He
[2:14:54] said, "I started preaching to the faith
[2:14:55] that was down on the inside of you cuz
[2:14:58] my wife couldn't do it.
[2:15:00] Our churches couldn't do it. Prayers
[2:15:02] around the world couldn't do it. I had
[2:15:04] to remember
[2:15:08] in that comeoma state. I had to remember
[2:15:12] who I am.
[2:15:15] [Applause]
[2:15:27] He preached, Brother Tim preached in
[2:15:30] those
[2:15:31] services. God will have a testimony.
[2:15:35] He preached before the miracle happened.
[2:15:41] God will have a testimony. Then he
[2:15:44] preached on God's Hall of Fame.
[2:15:47] Thank God I made
[2:15:53] it. When he preached God will have a
[2:15:56] testimony, I would had no plans of going
[2:15:59] here tonight. But when he preached on
[2:16:01] God Will Have a Testimony, Sister Connie
[2:16:03] left the
[2:16:05] hospital. And of course, I was in the
[2:16:07] burn
[2:16:08] unit. And she knew her strength came
[2:16:10] from the word of God.
[2:16:13] I'm not criticizing
[2:16:14] nobody, but listen, laying there,
[2:16:16] sitting there looking at me in that
[2:16:18] horrible state wasn't bringing her
[2:16:20] strength. She knew I had to get to
[2:16:22] church. She knew she had to hear what
[2:16:25] God's man would say.
[2:16:30] And it inspired faith on the inside of
[2:16:32] her. Are you with me now? The doctors
[2:16:36] was telling her, "He's not going to
[2:16:38] live.
[2:16:39] But God said I would.
[2:16:43] The doctor sat on my bed and told me
[2:16:46] with this cancer fight after they did a
[2:16:48] brain getting ready to do brain surgery,
[2:16:50] one of two surgeries, and they took out
[2:16:52] a big old tumor out of the back of my
[2:16:54] head. And he said, she said, "You'll
[2:16:58] have about four months to live. Get all
[2:17:00] your affairs in
[2:17:05] order." But I remembered what they told
[2:17:07] me when they told me, "You'll never walk
[2:17:10] again."
[2:17:11] My words in response to them was, "You
[2:17:14] don't know who you're talking to."
[2:17:23] It's not a right and mighty Ron Spencer.
[2:17:26] This Ron Spencer's been in the floor and
[2:17:28] Sister Connie getting him up. This Ron
[2:17:31] Spencer fought seizures for five years.
[2:17:34] This Ron Spencer has fought chemo and
[2:17:36] everything that goes with it. Organs
[2:17:38] dying. But listen, it ain't me, it's
[2:17:56] him. Help me,
[2:17:58] God. I was Can I tell you one more
[2:18:01] story?
[2:18:04] I was I'm not a fisherman,
[2:18:07] but I preached a meeting in
[2:18:11] Alaska and they were they took me
[2:18:15] fishing. They went to the store, bought
[2:18:18] me a $10 license, gave me a reel, a rod
[2:18:21] and a reel that I really didn't know how
[2:18:24] to
[2:18:25] operate. And I had to get out in the
[2:18:27] water. I'm scared to death of
[2:18:29] water. I get out in the water and I'm
[2:18:32] standing there. I'm throwing the reel.
[2:18:34] And listen, there's people all beside me
[2:18:35] pushing beside him. We're throwing in
[2:18:37] the same hole.
[2:18:39] And there's a guy standing beside of me
[2:18:40] and he says, "Uh," he said, "Uh, what'd
[2:18:43] you pay to get here?" I said, "I don't
[2:18:45] know. What did you pay?" He said, 'Well,
[2:18:47] my God behind me, he charged me $5,000
[2:18:50] and said, "We're going to have a great
[2:18:52] day." And I'm standing there thinking, I
[2:18:54] just paid
[2:19:02] $10. Well, there's a guy on the left
[2:19:04] side of me. He began to talk to me. He
[2:19:06] said, "You're around these parts?" I
[2:19:08] said, "No, I'm a Virginia boy." He said,
[2:19:11] "You have eagles back home?" I said,
[2:19:13] "You know, we have sparse eagles. We got
[2:19:15] one or two and we'll see them and we'll
[2:19:17] call it a significant supernatural day
[2:19:20] if we see an eagle. We'll say God's
[2:19:22] speaking to us if we see an eagle." He
[2:19:24] said, "Well, we got eagles all over the
[2:19:25] place up here." He said, you know, he
[2:19:27] said, "If you'll watch these eagles," he
[2:19:28] said, "they'll come down and they'll
[2:19:30] grab a fish. They're better fishermen
[2:19:31] than we
[2:19:32] are." I said, "Yeah." He said, "Watch
[2:19:34] them." Sure enough, after a little
[2:19:36] while, we saw one come down, grab a grab
[2:19:38] a salmon, took off and gone, you know,
[2:19:40] and he said, he said, 'You know, of
[2:19:42] course, he didn't know who he was
[2:19:43] talking
[2:19:45] to. He said, you know, he said,
[2:19:47] uh, I was here one day and one of these
[2:19:50] eagles, he said, you know, they have
[2:19:52] opponents.
[2:19:55] He said, they have an enemy. Yeah. And
[2:19:58] he said, this
[2:19:59] eagle was flying and he said, I was just
[2:20:02] watching him. He said, "I was admiring
[2:20:03] him, you know, standing here fishing,
[2:20:05] getting no bites." And he said, "I was
[2:20:07] watching him." He said, "He was just
[2:20:08] flying." And, you know, he was so
[2:20:11] beautiful. And all of a sudden, this
[2:20:13] bird hit him in his
[2:20:16] head from out of nowhere. And that bird,
[2:20:20] that eagle started
[2:20:25] going as it comes down. It's just
[2:20:28] coming. It's coming and it's coming. And
[2:20:31] he said, "You'll never believe this,"
[2:20:33] but he was about to splash down in the
[2:20:35] water and he said he shook
[2:20:40] [Music]
[2:20:50] himself right now. I'm about ready to
[2:20:52] dance with him. You know, he don't know
[2:20:54] he's talking to an eagle standing right
[2:20:56] beside of him. He don't know this is
[2:20:58] going to be really good sermon material.
[2:21:01] He said when that eagle realized he was
[2:21:03] all right,
[2:21:05] that bird that had attacked him was in
[2:21:08] trouble.
[2:21:24] I want to scream to you. Shake
[2:21:29] yourself. Shake
[2:21:32] yourself. Your wings are still strong.
[2:21:35] Your beak is still strong. You're built
[2:21:38] to withstand the pressure. You're built
[2:21:41] to rain over the dominion of the skies.
[2:21:45] You may have got hit. You may have got
[2:21:48] knocked out. Shake your s.
[2:22:12] It's probably not a good place to quit.
[2:22:19] There's a girl named Aaliyah KS here.
[2:22:26] She here. Could she
[2:22:35] stand? You didn't know what I was going
[2:22:37] to
[2:22:40] preach. You had no idea what I was going
[2:22:44] to
[2:22:46] preach. You wrote it to me thinking that
[2:22:49] me and Sister Connie was going to be the
[2:22:50] only ones that would get to hear it.
[2:22:55] But when I opened the package the other
[2:22:58] day, I said, "This is my finishing
[2:23:06] statement." You see, it's on the inside
[2:23:08] of
[2:23:09] you. You, you, you, you,
[2:23:16] you. And she writes me a
[2:23:19] poem. And this poem says, "Take that
[2:23:24] devil. When I fall, he lifts me
[2:23:28] up. When I fail, he forgives me.
[2:23:32] When I'm weak, he is strong."
[2:23:35] When I am lost, he's my way. Amen. When
[2:23:40] I'm afraid, he's my courage. Amen. When
[2:23:44] I stumble, he steadies me. When I'm
[2:23:48] hurt, he heals me.
[2:23:50] When I'm broken, he mends me. When I'm
[2:23:54] blind, he leads me. When I'm hungry, he
[2:23:57] feeds me. When I face trials, he is with
[2:24:01] me. When I face problems, he comforts
[2:24:05] me. When I face
[2:24:07] loss, he provides for me.
[2:24:12] When I'm dry, he is my cup.
[2:24:17] When I face
[2:24:18] death, he carries me home. Amen. He is
[2:24:23] my God and I am his and he is
[2:24:28] mine. He is with
[2:24:33] me and he is for me.
[2:24:38] [Applause]
[2:24:55] said, "Well, brother Ron, that that's
[2:24:57] just really nice that she sent
[2:25:00] there." Well, let me give you a little
[2:25:03] background. That
[2:25:05] day, I had 10 seizures.
[2:25:18] And when I w opened it
[2:25:21] up and I read
[2:25:25] it, God whispered in my ear, "I told you
[2:25:30] I'm with you.
[2:25:39] What good did it do, brother Ron? Did
[2:25:42] the seizure stop? No. But it told me
[2:25:45] there's light at the end of the
[2:26:00] tunnel. I I'm sorry.
[2:26:05] I just want to share a couple things. He
[2:26:06] said, 'I shall not live. I shall not
[2:26:08] die, but live and dequire the works of
[2:26:11] the
[2:26:12] Lord, for thou hast chasened me sore,
[2:26:17] but he hath not given me over to death.
[2:26:20] Psalms
[2:26:22] 118, 17, and 18. Luke chapter 1 and
[2:26:26] verse 37 says, "For with
[2:26:29] God
[2:26:30] nothing is impossible." Amen. Yes.
[2:26:34] Isaiah 41:10 says, "Fear thou not, for I
[2:26:37] am with thee. Be not dismayed. For I am
[2:26:39] thy God. I will strengthen thee. Yay, I
[2:26:42] will help thee. Yay, I will uphold thee
[2:26:44] with the right hand of of my
[2:26:46] righteousness."
[2:26:48] Can I give you one more? For God hath
[2:26:49] not given us the spirit of fear.
[2:26:55] God has not given us a spirit of fear,
[2:26:59] but of power and of love, out of a sound
[2:27:04] mind.
[2:27:18] The scripture tells us if God before us.
[2:27:26] If God before us,
[2:27:30] I want to ask you, how big is your God?
[2:27:35] My God spoke the worlds into existence.
[2:27:40] Everything you see, God spoke into
[2:27:42] existence. More than just squirrels,
[2:27:45] more than a silver tip grizzly bear,
[2:27:47] more than a 42. Are you with me now? My
[2:27:50] God said, "Let there
[2:27:52] [Applause]
[2:27:53] be." And he believed his own
[2:28:03] word. Where was you,
[2:28:05] Job? Where was you, Kelly? Where was
[2:28:09] you, brother Tim?
[2:28:13] Where was you
[2:28:16] when I laid the foundations of the
[2:28:17] earth?
[2:28:19] I got your battle, brother Tim.
[2:28:29] I feel the Holy Ghost.
[2:28:34] Now, the critic might say,
[2:28:36] "Well, you know, you know Tim Pru is a
[2:28:40] man.
[2:28:41] Duh.
[2:28:46] But I don't know if you've looked past
[2:28:48] the veil.
[2:28:50] He's not paying me to say this, but I've
[2:28:53] been around a long time. He's one of the
[2:28:56] greatest preachers that ever lived in
[2:28:59] history.
[2:29:02] Boot devil.
[2:29:05] Well, what about our imperfections,
[2:29:06] Brother Ron?
[2:29:09] If you remember David that we started
[2:29:11] with after he conquered a lion and a
[2:29:14] bear and Goliath and thousands of people
[2:29:18] were slain and his his he became a great
[2:29:21] a great king and they conquered nation
[2:29:24] after nation after nation.
[2:29:27] He said,
[2:29:29] "After I
[2:29:31] wonder I wonder if there's
[2:29:35] any of Saul and Jonathan's family
[2:29:40] that's still living." Come on. And then
[2:29:43] you begin to make a search
[2:29:47] and there was a crippled boy
[2:29:50] that the nurse jumped out the window
[2:29:53] and crushed his legs and he would be
[2:29:55] crippled the rest of the days of his
[2:29:56] life
[2:29:59] and they found
[2:30:01] him. Mphibichef did not realize when the
[2:30:05] chariots of the king came to get him.
[2:30:10] No doubt the the enemy whispers in his
[2:30:12] ear, "They're going to kill you.
[2:30:16] They're going to kill you. You're part
[2:30:18] of Saul's family. You're part of
[2:30:21] Jonathan's family."
[2:30:24] And you know how they do former kings?
[2:30:26] They kill the whole family.
[2:30:29] The great mighty soldiers get out and
[2:30:32] lead him to the chariot.
[2:30:35] I don't know. But he makes his
[2:30:38] way makes his
[2:30:42] way to the
[2:30:45] chariot. It's the nicest chariot he's
[2:30:47] ever seen. And he gets up in
[2:30:51] it. Now going through his mind, the
[2:30:54] devil is whispering, "They're going to
[2:30:56] kill you. You'll never see your family
[2:30:58] again.
[2:31:00] You're just another
[2:31:03] monument." Those soldiers are sworn to
[2:31:06] secrecy. When they get him there, they
[2:31:08] take his clothes off and they give him a
[2:31:13] robe. Not just any robe.
[2:31:16] A king's family robe.
[2:31:19] And they set him up in a room and a part
[2:31:22] of the castle.
[2:31:25] Not just a dungeon,
[2:31:27] but they put him in the
[2:31:29] nicest nicest room he's ever been in.
[2:31:34] And nobody looks around and goes, "What
[2:31:35] is all of this about?" And it comes
[2:31:38] supper time.
[2:31:42] And all of the generals and all the
[2:31:45] family sat down at David's table. Yeah.
[2:31:49] And David's watching toward the end of
[2:31:51] the end of the table, waiting on another
[2:31:53] guest.
[2:31:56] And they hear stumbling down through the
[2:31:59] hall a
[2:32:02] boy making his way. He don't have armor
[2:32:06] like all of Joab and all of his
[2:32:09] men. He don't have great big soldiers
[2:32:12] like shoulders like a lot of those
[2:32:13] soldiers,
[2:32:15] but he's the man in the marina. Amen.
[2:32:18] He makes his
[2:32:21] way into the banqueting
[2:32:26] hall. He looks across this long
[2:32:29] celebrity
[2:32:32] table. From this day
[2:32:34] forward, he has a place at the table.
[2:32:41] Let me tell you something about our
[2:32:42] father's table.
[2:32:44] When Mphibichef sat down and he pulled
[2:32:48] his legs around under the table and the
[2:32:51] cloth covered over top of him from here
[2:32:54] up
[2:32:57] he was perfect.
[2:33:01] God knows how to take care of all of our
[2:33:04] imperfections.
[2:33:20] Now
[2:33:21] tonight we
[2:33:24] come many of us have needs. Yeah.
[2:33:28] Now, no doubt the enemy has wared with
[2:33:31] you, trying to keep you from coming to
[2:33:32] the meeting, maybe even getting sleepy
[2:33:35] during the services. And maybe even as I
[2:33:38] went through the sermon, you didn't
[2:33:39] realize that this sermon was now coming
[2:33:42] to your
[2:33:43] turn. For we walk through prayer lines
[2:33:46] individually.
[2:33:51] No man is a healer.
[2:33:54] No man is a healer. God is the healer.
[2:34:01] And before you ever get touched by a
[2:34:04] minister or anointed with
[2:34:07] all, you got to do some
[2:34:12] talking. You may never get to walk
[2:34:14] through a prayer line again in your
[2:34:15] life. You say, "Brother Ron, I don't
[2:34:18] know God. I came to this meeting. I
[2:34:20] don't know nothing about God. I'm
[2:34:21] backslid. I've been on the run from
[2:34:23] God." Tonight's the time to get it
[2:34:24] fixed. Come on.
[2:34:27] Are you with me? Tonight's the night to
[2:34:29] get it fixed. Brother Ron, I've been
[2:34:30] riding the fence. Tonight's the night to
[2:34:32] get it fixed. Brother Ron, I need the
[2:34:34] Holy Ghost. Tonight's the night.
[2:34:41] No man can give it to you, but God's
[2:34:43] here to do it.
[2:34:49] He's here to do it.
[2:34:52] Now, I've sat in now hundreds and
[2:34:57] hundreds of practicing physicians call
[2:35:01] specialist and they point at screens and
[2:35:04] go, "There's your
[2:35:06] cancer. There's
[2:35:08] cancer." Now, if it's left alone, if
[2:35:11] it's left alone, it'll not just eat that
[2:35:14] cell, but it'll eat all kind of cells.
[2:35:16] And then it'll eat organs. It'll destroy
[2:35:18] it. And cancer brings friends, sugar,
[2:35:21] diabetes, all different kinds of things.
[2:35:25] But our prophet said, "Don't you fear
[2:35:27] it.
[2:35:31] Don't you fear it, brother. I've got a
[2:35:33] horrible disease. Don't you fear it.
[2:35:39] Don't you fear it.
[2:35:41] You heard him say just a little while
[2:35:42] ago about going to the eye clinic.
[2:35:47] Four specialists had already told me
[2:35:49] that I had eye cancer in both eyes.
[2:35:52] Sister Connie and I was sitting at the
[2:35:54] end of about an 80 foot
[2:35:57] hallway
[2:35:59] waiting and the next specialist is going
[2:36:02] to take the time to take my eye
[2:36:05] out and he's going to shoot chemo in my
[2:36:09] other eye. And they've already told me
[2:36:11] it's a good possibility I'm going to be
[2:36:13] blind. But I got another report.
[2:36:28] She and I walk down that hallway one
[2:36:31] step at a time and I can hear her say,
[2:36:32] "Jesus, help us. Jesus, help us. Jesus,
[2:36:36] help us. Jesus, help us." She's going
[2:36:38] down that hallway and we step in there.
[2:36:40] He's with us. We wait about an hour. He
[2:36:43] comes in.
[2:36:45] He looks in my
[2:36:46] eyes and he said, 'Well, everything
[2:36:49] looks fine to me.
[2:36:55] You know, sometimes it happens so quick
[2:36:56] you go,
[2:36:58] "What?
[2:37:01] What?" And he walks out. He said, "I'll
[2:37:03] see you in six
[2:37:05] months." And I said, "Hey, we've been
[2:37:07] told by four of your team that I have
[2:37:09] eye cancer. I I've been getting call
[2:37:10] after call I got eye cancer to get
[2:37:12] myself prepared." She said, 'I'll bring
[2:37:14] him back in. He walks in. He sits down
[2:37:17] under his desk. He folds his feet. He
[2:37:20] laughs. He said,
[2:37:25] 'Well, well, it was a miscommunication.
[2:37:32] So, you mean at the other end of the
[2:37:34] hall I had it?
[2:37:47] And at this end of the hall, I don't
[2:37:49] have
[2:38:03] it. I don't do steps. Well, so I'm going
[2:38:05] to do an act of faith here.
[2:38:09] So you get in the prayer line and you
[2:38:11] four different demons have told you you
[2:38:14] got it.
[2:38:17] And they tell you even when you get
[2:38:19] here, you got it and you're going to
[2:38:21] have it the rest of your life.
[2:38:23] I I I'm not really good at measurements,
[2:38:26] but let's just say this is 80 ft. Oh
[2:38:28] yeah. And you go, Jesus, Jesus, help me.
[2:38:32] Jesus, help me over there. You had it.
[2:38:39] But over here, you ain't got it no more.
[2:38:46] That's my God.
[2:38:59] That's my God.
[2:39:01] He never fails. He never gets in a
[2:39:04] crisis.
[2:39:06] He never turns around and walks away. He
[2:39:09] is the mighty conqueror.
[2:39:13] He said, "I have power to lay my life
[2:39:15] down and power to take it up again."
[2:39:23] We have an empty tomb.
[2:39:36] You're going to kill
[2:39:41] me. Now, I want you to do a little
[2:39:45] exercise before we
[2:39:48] start. Testimony starts sometimes before
[2:39:51] the cancer's gone.
[2:39:56] Sometimes cancer comes before the trial
[2:39:59] is over with.
[2:40:03] Sometimes the the enemy is all over you
[2:40:06] and you just start testifying.
[2:40:08] The curse is over.
[2:40:12] You just start preaching sermons like
[2:40:15] the hurt will not the hurt that you're
[2:40:17] fighting will not destroy the music.
[2:40:21] You preach sermons like this. Take it
[2:40:23] back.
[2:40:29] You have heard me for five years preach
[2:40:31] testimonies
[2:40:33] and I've stood here before you tonight
[2:40:34] as a living
[2:40:36] example of what brother Brandham was
[2:40:38] talking about in a cave with an angel is
[2:40:41] effective.
[2:40:44] If you've got any doubts about the
[2:40:46] message, look right here.
[2:40:52] If there's any questions that you've got
[2:40:54] about the supernatural,
[2:40:56] look right here.
[2:40:59] I want to tell you this message works.
[2:41:05] [Applause]
[2:41:26] Maybe in your spirit you're going, "If I
[2:41:29] can just make it through this service,
[2:41:30] I'm going to go back and be the same way
[2:41:31] I've always been. I'm going I'm going to
[2:41:33] try to keep myself numb and neutral. I'm
[2:41:35] not going to try to get myself all
[2:41:36] worked up. I'm going to go back and be
[2:41:38] an alcoholic. I'm going to go back to my
[2:41:40] drugs. I'm going to go back to the wrong
[2:41:41] kind of girls, the wrong kind of music.
[2:41:43] Let me just say this to you. Fight all
[2:41:44] you want to, but there's nothing out
[2:41:46] there.
[2:41:52] There's nothing out there worth going to
[2:41:54] hell for.
[2:42:00] Nothing. Absolutely
[2:42:05] nothing. There's not a job.
[2:42:10] There's not a sports
[2:42:12] contract. There's not a woman. There's
[2:42:15] not a man worth going to hell
[2:42:21] for.
[2:42:23] Nobody. Why don't you just take your
[2:42:25] excuses right now and lay them down and
[2:42:28] say, "I'm tired of carrying these
[2:42:31] burdens. I've got to get to Jesus.
[2:42:51] My final pull to you now
[2:42:53] is while preaching to you and telling
[2:42:55] you these stories, God allows us into a
[2:42:58] channel into your life. And you know,
[2:43:02] you know, some of your
[2:43:06] backslid, you know, if you don't get it
[2:43:09] in a meeting like this, you don't have a
[2:43:11] fighting chance.
[2:43:18] Don't laugh me away.
[2:43:21] I'm the best friend that you can have
[2:43:22] right now. These men have give their
[2:43:25] life. Brother Tim has gi his life.
[2:43:28] Brother Timothy has given his life. All
[2:43:29] these workers have gave their life so
[2:43:31] that you could have an opportunity to go
[2:43:33] wash Jesus's feet.
[2:43:37] Listen, in eternity, you will not be
[2:43:39] known as a great basketball player.
[2:43:43] In hell, they don't even give credit for
[2:43:45] that. You'll not be known as some great
[2:43:48] millionaire or some great businessman.
[2:43:51] You'll not be known by what kind of hot
[2:43:53] car you're driving, how cool you are.
[2:43:55] That's right.
[2:43:57] But if you can get Jesus in your life
[2:43:59] that's trying to pull on your life.
[2:44:05] If you can make your
[2:44:07] way, if you can make your way. I'm tired
[2:44:10] of feeding hogs.
[2:44:13] I'm tired of slapping pigs. I'm going to
[2:44:16] go
[2:44:19] home. I'm going to go home. The servants
[2:44:23] eat better than I'm eating. I got to get
[2:44:26] to Jesus.
[2:44:37] Brother Ron, it seems like you pointed
[2:44:39] me
[2:44:39] out. You remember the ring? Yeah. You're
[2:44:44] the man in the arena.
[2:44:50] And I got to get it to
[2:44:51] you. No, there's not actors with black
[2:44:55] covers over their head now. But there's
[2:44:58] spirits that I have fought while I
[2:45:00] preached
[2:45:03] that's trying to protect you and to try
[2:45:05] to keep you from getting to Jesus.
[2:45:09] They're trying their best. They're
[2:45:11] igniting your mind. They're igniting
[2:45:12] you. Trying to keep you from getting
[2:45:14] what you really need. Come on. Why don't
[2:45:18] you defy the armies of the the devil
[2:45:20] right here tonight and say, "I'm sick of
[2:45:23] you.
[2:45:30] I'm sick of
[2:45:31] you. I asked for some shamguards
[2:45:35] tonight. Pick up your
[2:45:39] stick. Pick up your stick."
[2:45:42] We know Shamgar today because he
[2:45:45] recognized who he was
[2:45:51] in eternity. I want to shake your hand
[2:45:54] and if you don't
[2:45:56] mind, you don't have to do it tonight.
[2:45:58] Amen. But I want to shake your hand and
[2:46:02] you walk up to me. I'm going to be
[2:46:04] redheaded, 5 foot
[2:46:06] five, 165 pounds.
[2:46:10] Do you remember that night in Dry Creek
[2:46:13] when you said you was going to quit 20
[2:46:15] minutes before you actually
[2:46:19] did and you came to my house and you
[2:46:23] literally called my
[2:46:25] name? Thank you for taking the
[2:46:30] time to come after me.
[2:46:39] You cared enough, brother Ron
[2:46:45] to come after me. In all the filth of my
[2:46:49] life, Jesus sent you after me. Yeah. And
[2:46:54] I'm eternally
[2:46:59] grateful. How you know, brother
[2:47:02] Ron? Six Second Smith said, "You'll
[2:47:04] appreciate it.
[2:47:09] Could we bow our heads just for a
[2:47:11] moment?
[2:47:17] If our ministry routine will
[2:47:24] come, heavenly
[2:47:28] father, I've stood on this
[2:47:31] stage many
[2:47:38] times, but I can't say I ever felt as
[2:47:42] much of the power of God as I have felt
[2:47:50] tonight. No man can put these thoughts
[2:47:54] together, meetings like this
[2:48:02] together, just to have a protractive
[2:48:07] meeting. But God, you come to do
[2:48:09] business.
[2:48:13] You went to a man's house and let them
[2:48:16] shame
[2:48:17] you, knowing there was a woman that
[2:48:20] would come that was not welcome in any
[2:48:24] church. Her only hope was
[2:48:30] you. Everybody was making
[2:48:34] fun. She kneled at your
[2:48:39] feet. It was so emotional. The tears ran
[2:48:42] from her
[2:48:43] eyes. So much she was able to wash your
[2:48:48] feet. There was no towel
[2:48:55] provided. You just took her
[2:48:59] hair and dried your
[2:49:02] feet. No doubt there's some of those
[2:49:06] type of people here tonight.
[2:49:10] Let them turn now. Turn a
[2:49:19] corner. Walk away from a bad
[2:49:22] life, a wicked
[2:49:26] history, and let God make all things
[2:49:29] new. Amen.
[2:49:32] Father, you said come unto me all ye
[2:49:36] that are heavy and heavy laden and I'll
[2:49:38] give you
[2:49:40] rest. My yoke is easy, my burden is
[2:49:46] light.
[2:49:49] Father, you knew before the meeting
[2:49:52] start there would be people with
[2:49:53] cancer that you would heal.
[2:49:57] People with seizures that you would
[2:49:59] heal. Amen. People that needed the Holy
[2:50:03] Ghost that you would feel. Amen.
[2:50:07] Families that were in bad
[2:50:09] situations that you'd bring back
[2:50:11] together.
[2:50:13] Lost sons and daughters that they would
[2:50:16] find their way to Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:50:20] Lord, you see those that were
[2:50:23] haunted, devils fighting in every way.
[2:50:28] You came to this meeting to set them
[2:50:31] free. A greater than Solomon is in the
[2:50:34] building tonight.
[2:50:36] Father, we have stood up to the
[2:50:41] bully and we
[2:50:44] recognize as the words are whispered
[2:50:47] into our
[2:50:48] ears, Ron
[2:50:50] Spencer, you're a champion.
[2:50:54] You're a champion in Bleia.
[2:50:57] I built you to fight.
[2:51:00] Get up. Get up. Keep getting
[2:51:07] up. You're the final voice to the final
[2:51:13] age. I give you the keys to the kingdom.
[2:51:17] Now, Lord Jesus, we surrender our hearts
[2:51:20] to you now.
[2:51:24] I'm no prophet but father as the prophet
[2:51:27] said I take every spirit in this
[2:51:29] building under my control
[2:51:33] because the god of the prophets is
[2:51:35] here and Lord Jesus I ask you come touch
[2:51:40] this audience
[2:51:41] now come help them come minister to
[2:51:45] their
[2:51:46] lives Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:51:49] we pray. Amen. And
[2:51:55] amen. A young girl named
[2:52:00] Sophie Lays in Saskatoon Hospital. She's
[2:52:04] 10 years
[2:52:05] old. She's an only
[2:52:11] child. She was
[2:52:13] singing perfect shape the last weeks,
[2:52:16] years of her life.
[2:52:20] But the other day she had a brain
[2:52:22] [Music]
[2:52:25] bleed. She can't
[2:52:28] talk. She can't function. And the doctor
[2:52:32] says
[2:52:33] that she'll never return to
[2:52:36] [Music]
[2:52:37] normal. But it so happens there's a
[2:52:43] nurse that started telling her a
[2:52:45] testimony about a preacher with cancer.
[2:52:50] that had brain
[2:52:52] cancer. And the other day he got a clean
[2:52:57] scan. And that Catholic
[2:53:03] family said, "We got to get to a God
[2:53:05] like
[2:53:07] that." They're watching the service
[2:53:11] tonight. I want to tell you, family of
[2:53:14] sofa, we're praying for you. Amen. I
[2:53:19] want to tell you, don't give up.
[2:53:22] If it don't happen today, believe for it
[2:53:24] tomorrow. If it don't happen tomorrow,
[2:53:27] believe for it the next day. You just
[2:53:29] keep looking to Jesus, the author and
[2:53:32] the finisher of your
[2:53:33] [Applause]
[2:53:41] faith. God bless you. God bless you as
[2:53:44] you come.
[2:53:46] Amen. You want him to come this way,
[2:53:48] brother. Amen. If you'll just make your
[2:53:51] way this way and Amen, brother Timothy.
[2:53:56] Amen. Just go out that way and come
[2:54:01] around. Come
[2:54:03] around. You raised your hands. You have
[2:54:05] a need. Won't you
[2:54:07] come in the name of Jesus?

[4:40:14] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[4:40:16] Isn't God good to us?
[4:40:19] Amen. I know there's been hearts that
[4:40:22] have been touched in this meeting. I
[4:40:26] know there have been souls that have
[4:40:28] been changed in God's presence.
[4:40:32] You know, we got a commandment in the
[4:40:36] Bible and the commandment
[4:40:38] was that we should repent and be
[4:40:42] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[4:40:45] the remission of
[4:40:47] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[4:40:51] the Holy Ghost or the Holy Ghost as a
[4:40:55] gift. It's God's gift to you to come and
[4:40:59] dwell in the inside of you and make you
[4:41:00] a conqueror, make you an
[4:41:03] overcomer. And you know, I I know young
[4:41:06] people and some of you maybe will want
[4:41:09] to go back home where your parents are
[4:41:11] or whatever to be baptized. That's fine.
[4:41:15] But I know there's
[4:41:17] others that it's like Philillip was in
[4:41:22] the unic in the Bible. Here's water.
[4:41:26] What
[4:41:28] hinders? And you know, I've had
[4:41:30] experience through the years that even a
[4:41:32] young girl that came to the camp
[4:41:37] and sometimes later I got a call from
[4:41:40] her
[4:41:42] mother and she said, "Brother
[4:41:45] Puit, I want to thank
[4:41:48] you for your camp that you had. My
[4:41:52] daughter's 16.
[4:41:54] She made a promise to me. I I'll never
[4:41:56] I'll never just go because others are
[4:41:58] getting baptized or other people giving
[4:42:00] their heart. I I'll never do that
[4:42:02] because of
[4:42:03] others. It'll be because of a decision
[4:42:07] that I
[4:42:08] made. And said while she was at
[4:42:13] camp, you baptized her in the name of
[4:42:15] the Lord Jesus
[4:42:17] Christ. And I'll be forever
[4:42:21] grateful because today my daughter, 16,
[4:42:26] was killed in a car wreck. And I know
[4:42:30] I'll see her in
[4:42:36] glory. You know, she had that
[4:42:38] opportunity and she took it.
[4:42:41] And if you want to, if you want to step
[4:42:44] into the water tonight, if you want to
[4:42:46] go a little further with God and you've
[4:42:48] given your heart to him, you've
[4:42:51] surrendered your soul, if you would like
[4:42:53] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[4:42:57] Christ
[4:42:58] tonight, would you want to raise your
[4:43:00] hand right now? All right, I want you to
[4:43:03] step out of your seat. I want you to
[4:43:04] step right over here on this platform.
[4:43:07] Come on, each one of you. Amen. Amen.
[4:43:10] Amen. God bless you. Amen. I know
[4:43:12] there's more
[4:43:14] coming.
[4:43:16] Amen. You want to surrendered your heart
[4:43:19] to the Lord and you want to be
[4:43:23] baptized, taking on the name of Jesus
[4:43:25] Christ and make a full surrender of your
[4:43:28] life to the Lord. I know I know his
[4:43:32] promise. Let me tell you what his
[4:43:34] promise is. For he said when they asked
[4:43:38] him, "What must we do to be saved?" And
[4:43:42] Peter on the day of Pentecost gave the
[4:43:44] keys to enter into the kingdom of
[4:43:47] heaven. And he said, "Repent every one
[4:43:50] of you." That means turn from your sins.
[4:43:53] Invite Jesus to be the Lord of your
[4:43:55] life. Ask him to pardon you and then
[4:44:00] receive that pardon and say, "I accept
[4:44:03] it now. I accept your pardon. I accept
[4:44:07] your forgiveness. And you know what
[4:44:09] you're receiving? You're receiving the
[4:44:10] greatest trade you could ever get. Where
[4:44:14] that you will trade your sins and in
[4:44:18] turn receive his
[4:44:20] righteousness. That's his promise to
[4:44:23] you. Amen. That you all your sins he
[4:44:28] will take and he will give you his
[4:44:31] righteousness.
[4:44:33] Whether you stand in the front of God's
[4:44:35] presence,
[4:44:37] blameless, without a
[4:44:39] spot, Jesus bore it all. In Romans
[4:44:43] chapter 5, he said he became sin for us
[4:44:47] that we might become the righteousness
[4:44:50] of God in Christ
[4:44:53] Jesus. That's what he did. He became
[4:44:56] your sin. He's making a trade tonight.
[4:45:00] You're giving him your sins, all your
[4:45:03] wrongs, your past, every bit of
[4:45:07] it. He's your
[4:45:10] sacrifice, and you lay your hands upon
[4:45:12] him, and the transfer of your sins goes
[4:45:16] upon him. But the wonderful thing about
[4:45:18] it, it's not like the Old Testament
[4:45:20] where the innocence and the and of the
[4:45:23] lamb could come back upon could not come
[4:45:26] back upon the worshipper. But in this
[4:45:29] covenant, the very righteousness of
[4:45:32] Jesus Christ is transferred back to you
[4:45:35] where that you receive of the
[4:45:37] righteousness of God. And that's where
[4:45:40] the Bible said the just, those that are
[4:45:42] forgiven, those that are declared
[4:45:44] righteous shall live by faith. Amen.
[4:45:49] You're going to live a life of faith
[4:45:51] from now on taking this step. and he
[4:45:54] promised he would fill you with the Holy
[4:45:57] Ghost. Let's bow our heads together.
[4:45:58] Father in the name of Jesus Christ as
[4:46:02] these are committing their heart to you
[4:46:05] and give surrendering their lives and
[4:46:07] taking on the name of Jesus Christ.
[4:46:10] Lord, we're taking Lord those who have
[4:46:14] died now to their sins. We're going to
[4:46:16] bury them in a watery grave, but they
[4:46:19] will rise up in the newness of life with
[4:46:22] a new life to live. Oh God, with a new
[4:46:26] name to bear. They will no longer bear
[4:46:29] the name of shame or the name of sin.
[4:46:33] Oh, there will no longer will that be
[4:46:35] their identity, but now their identity
[4:46:39] will be with Jesus Christ taking on the
[4:46:42] name, the family name of the Lord Jesus
[4:46:45] Christ being buried in the precious name
[4:46:47] of Jesus. I pray God as they go to the
[4:46:50] water, may you fill them with the Holy
[4:46:52] Ghost in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God
[4:46:56] bless you. I want you to go to your
[4:46:58] dorms. I want you to prepare for baptism
[4:47:00] and grab a towel and they will meet you
[4:47:02] right down here at at one of the pools.
[4:47:04] They'll give you an announcement right
[4:47:06] outside. So, just go right now and and
[4:47:09] and make your change and get prepared.
[4:47:12] God bless you, church. Isn't it good to
[4:47:15] see what God can do? Amen. How he can
[4:47:19] change your life. How he can set you
[4:47:22] free. Amen.
[4:47:24] Oh, what a wonderful savior. What a
[4:47:27] mighty God. Amen. He's our healer, our
[4:47:31] deliverer, our soul savior. Amen. Let's
[4:47:35] bow our heads together now. Father, I
[4:47:38] pray that you'll bless now as we dismiss
[4:47:41] and as these young people will go, Lord,
[4:47:44] and they'll go to the baptism or Father,
[4:47:47] they'll they'll spend these few more
[4:47:49] moments. Father, I pray that you'll be
[4:47:52] with them. God, give them that peace in
[4:47:55] their heart that surpasses all
[4:47:57] understanding and let the work that is
[4:48:00] dark in them be finished in Jesus name.
[4:48:04] Amen. God bless you. Amen.
