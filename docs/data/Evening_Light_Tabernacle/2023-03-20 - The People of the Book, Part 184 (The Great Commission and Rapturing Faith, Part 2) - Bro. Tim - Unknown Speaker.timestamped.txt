[52:50] [Music]
[52:52] just wanted to take a moment today
[52:55] is we just um
[52:58] begin this part of this service
[53:00] has already been mentioned about our
[53:03] brother Claude Sigmund
[53:05] passing away brother Claude and his wife
[53:09] sister Diana
[53:10] they came to sojourn with us probably a
[53:14] year and a half ago
[53:16] came here without any Fanfare very
[53:19] quietly
[53:21] moving here from Washington and
[53:24] took their place in the house of God and
[53:27] last Thursday brother Claude quietly
[53:29] went home to be with the Lord
[53:31] he made it clear
[53:33] during our hospital visits that he was
[53:36] ready to go and wanted to go to his
[53:39] Heavenly home
[53:41] that was his desire and God granted that
[53:45] we want to
[53:47] thank the Lord for the life and the
[53:49] testimony
[53:50] that brother Claude had
[53:53] I understand the some years ago now God
[53:58] came and gloriously saved him and
[54:00] delivered him and
[54:02] just changed his life
[54:05] we're glad for a testimony you know I I
[54:08] look out and see young people and a lot
[54:11] of our well many of our young people are
[54:14] gone this weekend and our Minister teams
[54:17] away and
[54:19] different ones are going here and there
[54:21] and so we're a little bit smaller number
[54:23] this morning
[54:26] but when I look out and I just see and I
[54:29] think what this message produces
[54:33] the kind of families it produces the
[54:36] kind of men it produces women
[54:38] marriages homes
[54:41] what is produced by this taking a man
[54:45] like brother Claude that was a a sinner
[54:49] didn't know the Lord and
[54:51] bring him to have his own experience and
[54:54] deliver him
[54:55] [Music]
[54:56] and
[54:58] I believe it was in one service I was
[55:01] told of or brother biscal
[55:04] just called him out and said brother
[55:06] Claude you know I don't remember the
[55:08] words but I'll just put it my own
[55:10] today's the end of your cigarettes and
[55:12] brought him up and had prayer for him
[55:14] and God gloriously delivered him
[55:18] you know he's that kind of God
[55:21] that takes sin and darkness out of our
[55:23] lives and redeems Us by his blood
[55:27] we can't live here forever we wasn't
[55:30] designed to live here forever
[55:32] God said okay
[55:34] if you're making this choice
[55:37] going into sin and you're going to be
[55:40] birthed into temporal bodies I'm gonna
[55:43] make sure it's temporary
[55:44] because you're not going to live like
[55:46] this forever
[55:47] and this is when you look at yours
[55:50] you're on fleshed today and you just
[55:53] realize it's only a temporary home
[55:56] and the preparations you're making right
[55:59] now
[56:00] is for an eternal home
[56:03] there are things that are to be
[56:06] Jesus said I go to prepare a place for
[56:08] you
[56:09] that where I am you may be also
[56:13] that place is more than a mansion with a
[56:16] gold knob and
[56:18] my beautiful
[56:21] Exquisite Palace always much more than
[56:24] that
[56:24] why you could be an old arthritic King
[56:28] in the king's Palace
[56:30] crippled up unable to eat anything and
[56:33] grasping your last breath
[56:36] what would that mean to us
[56:39] but he said I want to prepare a place
[56:42] for you through the new birth I'm giving
[56:45] you
[56:46] I'm preparing you to be born into
[56:49] another body
[56:51] so you know with us there are three
[56:53] births
[56:55] we birth first into this flesh
[56:58] then we're born again that happens to
[57:01] the soul
[57:02] and then we one day will be birthed into
[57:06] a new body
[57:07] death is only the birth Pains of it
[57:11] struggles and men women go through you
[57:15] know thankfully brother Claude didn't
[57:16] have to go through it long I mean Came
[57:19] Upon Us cannabis a surprise
[57:21] working there as a side job there Ace
[57:25] Hardware walking 35 miles a week or so
[57:29] you know seemed to be doing well and
[57:33] thought he had a little allergy checks
[57:34] in the ER from there to ICU and we keeps
[57:38] going
[57:39] he didn't have to linger long
[57:41] some people go through a lot long long
[57:44] birth pains to be born into another body
[57:48] but God was gracious he ended his time
[57:52] of suffering here and we got to remember
[57:54] God's that kind of gracious God it isn't
[57:57] that he snatches our loved ones away
[58:00] from us and just rips him out of our
[58:02] arms no he comes and takes them from the
[58:07] snares and the clutches
[58:10] of sickness and pain and death and
[58:12] sorrow
[58:14] so let's just bow our heads for a moment
[58:16] as we remember brother Claude and
[58:20] ask God's blessings upon his wife and
[58:23] families got two children
[58:26] that live up in Washington and Canada
[58:29] may God bless them today
[58:32] as they think of their loss but may they
[58:36] also make preparations
[58:38] to meet him in a better land
[58:42] [Music]
[58:48] Lord sometimes
[58:51] in life's journey there's a little tear
[58:55] of sadness that comes
[58:57] maybe sometimes many tears
[59:01] we've all had our times of Sorrow
[59:04] troubles
[59:06] this life is few days and full of
[59:09] troubles
[59:10] our brother Claude you let him make his
[59:13] three score in ten
[59:16] and there he is today a young man on the
[59:19] other side
[59:21] you went to prepare a place for him
[59:24] you received him to yourself
[59:28] Lord we thank you Father for the power
[59:31] of the blood of Jesus it cleanses a man
[59:34] from sin and Washington white as snow
[59:38] and Lord and then welcomes him into the
[59:42] kingdom as a son as a child Lord we
[59:46] thank you for brother Claude his
[59:48] testimony his love for you and we'll
[59:51] always remember his his smile and the
[59:54] greetings they could give us
[59:57] the love that he shared with others I
[1:00:00] pray that you'll Comfort his wife sister
[1:00:02] Diana and or his children
[1:00:05] and encourage them today to make their
[1:00:08] plans to meet him in a better land
[1:00:12] I asked the Lord did for us as we kind
[1:00:14] of just dropped the belt just a little
[1:00:16] tighter knowing Lord that that's the way
[1:00:20] it's going to be
[1:00:21] no matter how much faith and power and
[1:00:24] miracles and things that you do and you
[1:00:25] do them but yet even right until the end
[1:00:29] there will be a few that will go right
[1:00:31] up by the way of the Grave only to come
[1:00:34] up in just a few minutes
[1:00:36] to go into the great resurrection and
[1:00:39] rapture
[1:00:40] until then Lord the cycle of death
[1:00:43] continues and but one day Lord it'll all
[1:00:47] be over and we look forward to that now
[1:00:50] I said Lord you'll give us strength to
[1:00:52] press on the battle
[1:00:54] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:58] amen God bless you I want you to get
[1:01:01] ready to play that song when the
[1:01:03] redeemed or gathering in I want to sing
[1:01:05] at least several verses of that
[1:01:08] amen Lord I want to be in that number we
[1:01:11] sung a while ago but we're also going to
[1:01:13] be with the redeemed that are gathered
[1:01:15] in
[1:01:16] now there won't be a service for brother
[1:01:18] Claude

[1:01:22] something private for him and his family
[1:01:25] um at a later time so uh just remember
[1:01:29] them in prayer but let's press on Amen

[1:05:02] every day
[1:05:12] that would be
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:16] hallelujah
[1:05:18] amen we're being gathered now as a
[1:05:21] bridegroom call Goes Forth amen we so
[1:05:24] looking forward to the Gathering there
[1:05:28] in that other dimension amen we may be
[1:05:31] speaking about some of that this morning
[1:05:33] but let's let's turn to Genesis 18 verse
[1:05:36] 10 for scripture reading I'm going to
[1:05:39] continue the thought on the Great
[1:05:41] Commission
[1:05:42] and and Rapture in faith
[1:05:46] and we're going to read this scripture
[1:05:48] where he said and I I was certainly
[1:05:50] returning to thee according to the time
[1:05:52] of life
[1:05:53] and loathe Sarah thy son shall that wife
[1:05:56] shall have a son and Sarah heard it in
[1:05:59] the tent which was behind him I want to
[1:06:02] let you be seated
[1:06:04] be making your way over to Mark 16 I got
[1:06:07] a couple of more scripture readings to
[1:06:09] make here
[1:06:10] but we'll look in the 15th verse there
[1:06:14] as we looked here in the
[1:06:18] setting of The Prophecy laying in
[1:06:20] Genesis we saw God was standing there in
[1:06:25] dust that he had gathered and made
[1:06:28] himself a body and now God Appears to
[1:06:31] him he actually eats while he's there
[1:06:34] he's hungry he eats he is fed his feet
[1:06:38] are washed he is entertained
[1:06:41] and and so as he's there he has a
[1:06:45] commission for Sarah
[1:06:47] to bring forth the promised son and in
[1:06:50] this commission he promises a return
[1:06:54] and in this return there has to be a
[1:06:57] change in her mortal body in order to
[1:07:00] receive this promised son or otherwise a
[1:07:03] 90 year old woman cannot bring forth
[1:07:04] this child so she has to return back to
[1:07:07] me in the bride that she was when she
[1:07:10] was married
[1:07:11] a young young girl but this time now
[1:07:14] just change back young again but the
[1:07:17] problem fixed right and God's not going
[1:07:19] to just change us back young again but
[1:07:22] the sin question and every evidence of
[1:07:24] it will be gone
[1:07:26] so now we look here
[1:07:28] um again and we see God once more takes
[1:07:31] on human flesh and here he is now born
[1:07:36] in a manger he comes into his ministry
[1:07:39] the Bible tells you it is the word made
[1:07:43] flesh so he's god-spoken word The
[1:07:46] Original Seed he's made flesh again it's
[1:07:50] the son of man what do we mean by that
[1:07:52] it is that God has come and wrapped
[1:07:56] himself in dust
[1:07:58] and and the Flesh of a man and God came
[1:08:02] in Christ that way he was ever bet a man
[1:08:05] yet he was God
[1:08:07] and so the fullness of God of the
[1:08:12] godhead bodily dwelt in him never said
[1:08:16] he dwelt into godhead it says that the
[1:08:19] godhead dwelt in him he was the fullness
[1:08:22] of the godhead bodily now he again is
[1:08:25] giving
[1:08:27] um his parting words to the church and
[1:08:31] his final instructions that we have read
[1:08:33] from Mark 16 which is the Great
[1:08:36] Commission Sarah receives a commission
[1:08:38] now again we have
[1:08:41] um the disciples given a commission and
[1:08:44] he said unto them go into all the world
[1:08:46] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[1:08:49] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:08:51] be saved that he that believeth not
[1:08:53] shall be damned and these signs shall
[1:08:55] follow them that believe in my name
[1:08:57] shall they cast out Devils they shall
[1:09:00] speak with new tongues they shall take
[1:09:02] up serpents if they drink any deadly
[1:09:05] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[1:09:07] they depends on the sick and they shall
[1:09:10] recover now we're going to go to the
[1:09:12] Book of Revelation and we're going to
[1:09:15] see now again a mighty angel coming down
[1:09:19] from heaven
[1:09:20] a mighty angel had come down from God
[1:09:23] out of Heaven to and wrapped himself in
[1:09:26] flesh and he would appear to now
[1:09:30] um uh to Abraham and Sarah there at the
[1:09:34] tent God again the pre-incarnate Christ
[1:09:38] also known as the pillar of fire the
[1:09:42] angel of the Covenant would wrap himself
[1:09:44] in human flesh would appear to Sarah
[1:09:48] are now to the excuse me the disciples
[1:09:52] and um just as he had to seren Abraham
[1:09:55] except now it was God himself the
[1:09:59] fullness of God manifest in flesh now in
[1:10:02] Revelation 10 we see again Christ coming
[1:10:05] down this is not the physical return of
[1:10:08] Christ because it is one who puts his
[1:10:12] foot on the land and on the sea so it's
[1:10:15] not a 1800 foot tall Jesus with a big
[1:10:19] foot over here and a Bigfoot over there
[1:10:20] there but this is symbolic of what he is
[1:10:23] doing as he comes down this time I want
[1:10:27] you to understand he does not come like
[1:10:30] he did in the days of Sodom by gathering
[1:10:34] 16 elements and wrapping himself in
[1:10:37] flesh and and walking and appearing to a
[1:10:41] seren Abraham neither does this time he
[1:10:43] come and and form himself in the womb of
[1:10:46] a woman and and wrap the dust around the
[1:10:50] spoken word seed and the out comes the
[1:10:54] Son of God but this time the blood has
[1:10:58] so redeemed man
[1:11:00] and has cleanse man that God is now
[1:11:04] coming down in human flesh
[1:11:07] and he will use now in this passage he
[1:11:11] will come here and flesh but he will use
[1:11:13] the vehicle of a son of man not the son
[1:11:17] of man a son of man a prophet and that
[1:11:21] Prophet will will speak the voice of God
[1:11:24] even as Jesus was the voice of God and
[1:11:28] even as um the the Angels standing the
[1:11:31] angel Lord standing there to seren
[1:11:34] Abraham was the voice of God we would
[1:11:36] again in this last day hear from a
[1:11:40] prophet to whom the word of the Lord
[1:11:43] would come to as I said he would not be
[1:11:46] the son of man he would be a son of man
[1:11:50] that means he is a prophet or if we can
[1:11:54] say a son of man that literally means
[1:11:57] um a son of dust and that God would
[1:12:00] again use the lips of a man to bring a
[1:12:06] message in the last say but it would be
[1:12:08] the same angel
[1:12:11] the same Mighty Angel the pre-incarnate
[1:12:15] Christ that was there in the days of
[1:12:17] Abraham and then the Incarnate Christ in
[1:12:21] the days when Jesus walked now the Holy
[1:12:24] Spirit coming the same Angel the same
[1:12:27] Pillar of Fire now speaking through a
[1:12:30] prophet in this last day
[1:12:32] but I I want you to see that it doesn't
[1:12:35] end there that it continues on with the
[1:12:39] same Angel The Mighty angel coming down
[1:12:42] with the open book and a people then
[1:12:46] given voice to that
[1:12:48] and actually they too are the
[1:12:52] manifestation of the son of man Christ
[1:12:55] upon the Earth
[1:12:57] so as we would look now the mighty Angel
[1:12:59] does not leave
[1:13:01] amen the mighty Angel comes down to uh
[1:13:05] and when I say he doesn't leave I mean
[1:13:06] he doesn't leave with a prophet coming
[1:13:09] he he actually comes down he puts his
[1:13:12] feet a feet on the land and the Sea this
[1:13:14] is all symbolic remember even the Bible
[1:13:18] tells you that Christ is ahead of the
[1:13:21] church
[1:13:22] but his church is his body
[1:13:25] and that every devil is under your feet
[1:13:28] so if you're noticing the cloud is or
[1:13:32] even the cloud in 1963. it didn't show a
[1:13:36] body it showed a head in the heavens
[1:13:38] because God has a body on Earth
[1:13:42] and it is through that body that he has
[1:13:45] taken possession and holding down the
[1:13:49] powers of Hell the the Beast that rises
[1:13:52] up out of the land where there is no
[1:13:55] people that has rose up there's a power
[1:13:58] that rises up out of America where there
[1:14:01] was not not a populist people and over
[1:14:03] here another Beast has risen up out of
[1:14:06] the sea which says multitudes and and
[1:14:08] kindreds and tongues and people which is
[1:14:10] wrong and so the feet are are now placed
[1:14:14] on both of these because of the blood of
[1:14:18] Jesus Christ and the opening of the book
[1:14:23] gives us authority over the devil
[1:14:27] so I want you to I want you to see by
[1:14:30] receiving the Divine inheritance it
[1:14:33] gives us authority over the devil now so
[1:14:37] if you'll look with me in Revelation 10
[1:14:39] 1 we're going to read this chapter and
[1:14:43] again here in lies the last Commission
[1:14:47] Now to the church as it comes and we are
[1:14:50] also commissioned now and and in
[1:14:54] Revelation 10 and 1 and I saw another
[1:14:57] Mighty angel now this could only be
[1:14:59] Christ
[1:15:00] he is the Angel of the Covenant because
[1:15:03] he is clothed with the cloud a rainbow
[1:15:05] the full Covenant
[1:15:07] the sign of the Covenant is upon his
[1:15:09] head his face is as it were the son so
[1:15:13] his countenance is now is the fullness
[1:15:17] of the word coming and his feet as
[1:15:20] pillars of fire and remember who are his
[1:15:23] feet
[1:15:24] amen even if you're just a skin on his
[1:15:27] feet every devil is beneath you
[1:15:31] amen and notice he had it in his hand a
[1:15:35] little book open in the in Revelation 5
[1:15:38] it was closed but the lamb had taken the
[1:15:41] book now the lamb didn't need the book
[1:15:44] as almighty God he had the book
[1:15:47] so he comes for it now and he takes the
[1:15:51] book out of him that sat on the throne
[1:15:53] because he comes as a lamb now God's not
[1:15:56] wants to make you understand there's not
[1:15:59] two Gods there or neither two persons of
[1:16:02] God there because God or the person of
[1:16:06] God is not a lamb
[1:16:10] the lamb represents
[1:16:14] represents Christ in his redeeming work
[1:16:18] so he has seven horns and seven eyes
[1:16:21] he's a very strange looking lamb nothing
[1:16:24] there like this has ever been seen on
[1:16:26] the earth because it is symbolic of the
[1:16:29] Christ who will redeem a people through
[1:16:32] Seven Ages which represent the seven
[1:16:35] horns with seven seers which are seven
[1:16:38] prophets of God
[1:16:39] [Music]
[1:16:42] amen now these will be messengers of God
[1:16:46] that spoke of in the Book of Revelation
[1:16:48] so now as we look at it here it is
[1:16:51] Christ his faces his countenance his
[1:16:55] face is as it were the son and his feet
[1:16:59] as pillars of fire this is he's not
[1:17:02] veiled he's not closed off
[1:17:05] amen he's nothing is hidden everything
[1:17:08] is coming forward this is the fullness
[1:17:10] of his glory his word now coming and as
[1:17:14] the word comes it's going to come to the
[1:17:16] prophet watch and he said it he had in
[1:17:19] his hand a little book open he said his
[1:17:21] right foot on the sea is left foot on
[1:17:23] the earth and he cried or he shouts
[1:17:27] with a loud voice
[1:17:30] so let's understand now this is the
[1:17:33] shout of his coming
[1:17:35] we'd always speak of the coming of the
[1:17:38] Lord and many denominational people
[1:17:41] believe that it happens in a moment in a
[1:17:44] twinkling of an eye we do not believe
[1:17:46] that we believe our change takes place
[1:17:49] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but
[1:17:52] we believe that coming of the Lord is a
[1:17:55] process
[1:17:57] there has to come the restoration of the
[1:18:00] word in order to produce a bride because
[1:18:03] he can't marry the
[1:18:06] he can't marry her daughters and there's
[1:18:09] nothing bound of him so therefore there
[1:18:12] has to be a word brought that will
[1:18:13] create a bride calling her out from the
[1:18:18] all the world to himself
[1:18:20] amen so there again as we're looking at
[1:18:23] it he cries or he shouts with a loud
[1:18:25] voice as when a lion roar this is a king
[1:18:29] speaking this is a voice of authority
[1:18:32] and when it when he cried so when he
[1:18:36] shouts during his message seven Thunders
[1:18:40] utter their voices
[1:18:43] now John is watching all of this he is
[1:18:47] seeing a scene
[1:18:48] since he has been caught up in
[1:18:50] Revelation 4. he has already seen the
[1:18:53] seven churches he has seen the Seven
[1:18:56] Cities representing seven churches and
[1:18:59] seven stars in the hand of Jehovah which
[1:19:02] represents seven Messengers now he is
[1:19:05] looking here and and he's caught up in
[1:19:07] Revelation 4 and he sees the throne one
[1:19:10] sits on the throne he sees the scenes of
[1:19:13] The Throne Revelation 5 breaks it and he
[1:19:16] sees now the same changes as it comes
[1:19:20] into Redemption because here
[1:19:22] there was God who held the book this was
[1:19:26] the book that Adam lost
[1:19:28] Adam once had the right to eternal life
[1:19:33] all right but because of sin he lost his
[1:19:38] inheritance
[1:19:39] Satan's dirty hands couldn't take it
[1:19:43] amen so it went back in the hands of
[1:19:45] almighty God is a question document
[1:19:47] until there could be a man come to take
[1:19:52] the book now that man could not be
[1:19:55] William Branham the man could not be
[1:19:57] John Wesley the Jolly the man could not
[1:19:59] be the Apostle Paul the the man could
[1:20:03] not be Isaiah or Jeremiah or Elijah or
[1:20:07] Enoch there is no man that was worthy
[1:20:10] every man had been born in sin shaping
[1:20:14] iniquity come in the world speaking lies
[1:20:17] and none of them could take that book no
[1:20:20] man was worthy to even look on the book
[1:20:24] but now in Revelation 10 by that time
[1:20:28] something has happened a man has come in
[1:20:32] possession of the book because it
[1:20:34] screamed out as any man worthy in
[1:20:36] Revelation 5. so now it was looking for
[1:20:40] a worthy man and out of the midst of the
[1:20:42] throne came around
[1:20:44] this lamb represents God coming as a man
[1:20:49] to be the sacrifice to pay for man's sin
[1:20:54] and he was the only one worthy to take
[1:20:58] the book not when he takes the book
[1:21:01] remember he has not taken it for himself
[1:21:05] he was never lost
[1:21:09] but he's taking it as a man for man and
[1:21:15] in Revelation 10 once he has opened the
[1:21:18] book
[1:21:19] and then he comes down with the open
[1:21:22] book to deliver it to the people
[1:21:27] that's why we're preaching on the people
[1:21:30] of the buck
[1:21:37] now
[1:21:39] I don't know if you can fully grasp
[1:21:42] where we're living at
[1:21:45] but we are in a very awesome moment
[1:21:50] in time
[1:21:55] now when he shouts
[1:21:58] he shots with a loud voice
[1:22:01] that's when a lion roarth
[1:22:04] and when he cried or shouted seven
[1:22:07] Thunders uttered their voice so when
[1:22:09] this message is going forth seven
[1:22:11] Thunders utter their voices
[1:22:14] now what is the thunder
[1:22:16] a thunder is When God Says something
[1:22:19] and he doesn't want it known yet
[1:22:22] because it's for another age and for
[1:22:25] another time
[1:22:28] all right but it's the voice of God
[1:22:30] but we don't know what he said
[1:22:33] so we can go back to the days of Daniel
[1:22:35] and we can look back up in the in the
[1:22:38] and on the handwriting on the wall many
[1:22:40] many tackle you Farson
[1:22:42] God said something nobody knows what it
[1:22:45] means
[1:22:47] the The Magicians come out
[1:22:50] God said something we don't know what it
[1:22:53] means
[1:22:55] everybody's guessing well we think it
[1:22:58] means this and we think it means that
[1:23:00] we've had it for 2 000 years
[1:23:03] Scholars books written until you can
[1:23:06] line the theology halls with books that
[1:23:10] would probably go around the world
[1:23:12] of men's ideas until we have created
[1:23:16] over 40 000 different denominations
[1:23:25] and none of them are right
[1:23:28] not one of them
[1:23:31] not one of them
[1:23:33] and no Theologian had the right
[1:23:37] because it doesn't ever come to
[1:23:39] theologians
[1:23:41] Amos 3 and 7 says surely the Lord God
[1:23:43] will do nothing
[1:23:45] except it Reveals His secrets to his
[1:23:48] servants of prophets
[1:23:50] so now we have it here where that that
[1:23:54] that again we know it will have to be a
[1:23:56] prophet that will reveal it so this is
[1:23:59] what they came to and that day said yeah
[1:24:02] well you know all of you are guessing
[1:24:04] but let's bring the prophet on the scene
[1:24:07] there's Daniel
[1:24:09] call him up Daniel comes up and he says
[1:24:12] here's what it means now it weighed in
[1:24:14] the balance in your found warning so now
[1:24:17] we have the interpretation you see
[1:24:20] before we just had a mysterious writing
[1:24:23] that nobody understood but now when the
[1:24:27] prophet comes We Now understand what was
[1:24:30] once mysterious is now revealed
[1:24:35] are you with me now so again we have
[1:24:38] here a same thing something uttered we
[1:24:41] have no idea what it is
[1:24:44] so again we have the end there when as
[1:24:47] it does when the seven Thunders uttered
[1:24:50] their voices verse 4 I was about to
[1:24:54] write John said I was going to write
[1:24:56] what was said
[1:24:58] and he said I and I Heard a Voice from
[1:25:00] Heaven saying seal up
[1:25:03] those things which the seven Thunders
[1:25:06] uttered and write them not seven Thunder
[1:25:09] Seven Seals
[1:25:12] seven sealed up Mysteries
[1:25:16] that are not going to be made known
[1:25:19] now John you can't tell it
[1:25:23] this has something to do with the end
[1:25:25] time people it has something to do with
[1:25:26] my coming
[1:25:28] and I'm gonna hold it mysterious
[1:25:32] I'm going to hold it mysterious because
[1:25:34] if I let you know and this is why I'm
[1:25:37] writing this book of Revelation
[1:25:39] I'm not writing it in Parables or
[1:25:42] symbols
[1:25:43] as seven churches and Seven Stars and
[1:25:47] seven angels and you know seven golden
[1:25:50] candles all these symbolic things is
[1:25:53] parabolic and nobody understands it
[1:25:57] you see because it wasn't for them to
[1:26:00] know
[1:26:02] it is not their book
[1:26:05] it is your book
[1:26:10] Hallelujah it is when God unveils
[1:26:14] himself and he says now if I let them
[1:26:18] know in the first age that it's going to
[1:26:22] be Seven Ages later or two thousand
[1:26:25] years
[1:26:26] then nobody will be ready you know you
[1:26:29] know how men are oh the Lord's not
[1:26:31] coming to win uh 2000 after 2023 well no
[1:26:36] need to evangelize no need to get in a
[1:26:38] hurry no need to get the gospel out no
[1:26:40] need to fulfill the Great Commission no
[1:26:42] need
[1:26:45] we got a lot of time
[1:26:47] what didn't happen in our generation
[1:26:49] nobody would have died ready
[1:26:53] but God held that a secret
[1:26:56] because he wanted Paul expecting and and
[1:27:00] he left them expecting even though he
[1:27:02] gets a revelation of the Rapture the
[1:27:04] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:27:05] with his child and the voice and the
[1:27:07] trumpet all of this and dead in Christ
[1:27:09] shall rise and comfort one another with
[1:27:11] these words and you know you know you
[1:27:14] know don't don't sorrow as far as them
[1:27:16] that are asleep and he says you know we
[1:27:18] which are alive and remain we nothing
[1:27:22] God held that secret to him
[1:27:25] I'm not going to let you know Paul
[1:27:28] when I'm coming back
[1:27:30] because
[1:27:32] there are more in the book than you
[1:27:37] and I've got to wait on and I've got to
[1:27:40] intercede until the last one
[1:27:44] 's name is dipped in blood
[1:27:50] hallelujah amen brother Roger he
[1:27:52] couldn't have come 10 years ago amen he
[1:27:55] had to wait till your name was dipped in
[1:27:57] blood
[1:27:59] amen you see he's been it's been waiting
[1:28:02] on you
[1:28:04] to arrive
[1:28:07] and finally the last ones the last names
[1:28:11] on the book
[1:28:13] are manifested on the Earth
[1:28:16] and when it does God says okay in that
[1:28:19] age
[1:28:20] I'm gonna make it known
[1:28:26] so
[1:28:27] he says seal up those things
[1:28:31] the thunder-suttered and right them not
[1:28:34] and the angel which I saw stand on the
[1:28:37] sea and upon the Earth lit it up
[1:28:41] his hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:28:45] liveth forever and ever you know this is
[1:28:47] language that same thing that happened
[1:28:49] that did in Abraham's day God lifted up
[1:28:52] his hand and swore with an oath
[1:28:55] concerning the seed that was coming
[1:28:59] and so God does the same thing he swears
[1:29:01] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[1:29:04] created heavens and earth the things
[1:29:05] that therein are the Earth the things
[1:29:07] that therein are the Sea and the things
[1:29:08] which are therein that there should be
[1:29:10] time no longer
[1:29:14] that doesn't mean we taught us
[1:29:15] wristwatch away
[1:29:17] that would pull the clock off the wall
[1:29:20] that we no longer use a calendar
[1:29:22] that means that there that that I'm
[1:29:27] making a promise
[1:29:30] that there will come a time
[1:29:33] there will come a day
[1:29:35] when there will be no more delay
[1:29:40] of holding back this promise I swear I'm
[1:29:44] not going to leave it like this forever
[1:29:48] but I'm going to bring it down to an end
[1:29:51] time people who will know their God
[1:29:54] who will do exploits
[1:29:59] so he comes down and he says
[1:30:03] and then he explains why he said it
[1:30:06] won't be always delayed
[1:30:08] but
[1:30:10] now remember
[1:30:12] but is uh is an incomplete sentence but
[1:30:18] but I'm going to town
[1:30:22] what
[1:30:23] but I'm going home
[1:30:26] but
[1:30:28] Michael's a pretty good guy
[1:30:32] you wonder what I said about him before
[1:30:34] that don't you
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:41] there was something said before that
[1:30:43] what was said
[1:30:46] what was said that said there's coming a
[1:30:48] time this will not be delayed
[1:30:52] hold it up don't write it seal it up
[1:30:56] there are seven seals it's got to be
[1:30:58] revealed
[1:30:59] nobody knows them it's written in
[1:31:02] symbols there's a white horse red horse
[1:31:04] black horse Pale Horse all of this and
[1:31:07] nobody knows what to mean everybody's
[1:31:09] guessing
[1:31:10] theologians are writing books about it
[1:31:12] but nobody knows
[1:31:14] and it's going to remain that way you
[1:31:17] know but
[1:31:20] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:31:24] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:31:27] mystery of God should be finished
[1:31:31] as he had declared his servants the
[1:31:33] prophets
[1:31:34] so God has declared there's coming
[1:31:37] there's a time when the seventh angel
[1:31:39] sounds
[1:31:41] the mystery will be finished
[1:31:45] so he doesn't leave it there that we
[1:31:48] remain in this state forever
[1:31:51] there actually comes a time where there
[1:31:54] is a people to whom the seven Thunders
[1:31:56] are revealed
[1:31:58] what God said that he didn't want other
[1:32:01] ages to know
[1:32:03] so he says in verse 8
[1:32:06] and the voice which I heard
[1:32:08] from Heaven speaking to me again and
[1:32:11] said go and take the little book now the
[1:32:13] one who heard from heaven was the angel
[1:32:15] said go take the little book which is
[1:32:18] open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:32:19] standeth upon the the Sea and the Earth
[1:32:21] and I went to the angel and I said unto
[1:32:24] him give me the little book and he said
[1:32:26] unto me take it up and eat it take it
[1:32:29] and eat it up and it shall make that
[1:32:30] belly bitter but shall be in thy mouth
[1:32:33] sweet as honey and I took the little
[1:32:35] book out of the Angel's hand and ate it
[1:32:37] up and it was in my mouth's sweet as
[1:32:40] honey and as soon as I'd eaten my belly
[1:32:43] was bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:32:46] prophesy again
[1:32:48] before many peoples
[1:32:51] Nations and tongues
[1:32:53] notice
[1:32:55] the last Commission
[1:33:01] and it's the same as the first
[1:33:02] Commission
[1:33:06] the first commission was going to all
[1:33:08] the world the last commission says it
[1:33:10] you must prophesy again
[1:33:12] go into all the world and preach this
[1:33:15] one says preach it
[1:33:18] demonstrate it
[1:33:20] before many peoples Nations tongues and
[1:33:24] kings
[1:33:25] now we spoke last Sunday of the coming
[1:33:28] of the son of Mount
[1:33:30] and the pre-incarnate Christ as Sarah to
[1:33:33] fulfill the Great Commission given to
[1:33:35] Abraham which had not been done
[1:33:38] Abraham at this time has a son it is
[1:33:41] Ishmael but the bombs woman child
[1:33:44] did not fulfill it nor could he ever
[1:33:48] fulfill it
[1:33:50] and neither has denominations fulfilled
[1:33:53] the Great Commission and the promised
[1:33:55] son
[1:33:56] which comes at the end that promised son
[1:33:59] has not come
[1:34:01] even today we are looking for that
[1:34:04] promised son to come back
[1:34:07] is that right the coming of the Lord
[1:34:09] Jesus now as of 1965 at the end of
[1:34:13] brother battle's Ministry he was still
[1:34:16] saying the Great Commission had not been
[1:34:19] fulfilled and all scriptures must be
[1:34:23] fulfilled
[1:34:25] we are living in a very a very
[1:34:28] tumultuous time
[1:34:30] we are as it as it was in the days of
[1:34:33] Noah and we are as it was in the days of
[1:34:36] Sodom so we have the evil of all ages
[1:34:40] now coming in together
[1:34:42] the one that would be drowned by water
[1:34:44] the other that would be by that would be
[1:34:46] destroyed by fire
[1:34:48] and sin is magnified itself and heaped
[1:34:51] up against this generation
[1:34:54] both of these times were when God
[1:34:57] destroyed as we said one by water the
[1:35:00] other by fire and both times there were
[1:35:04] a people saved
[1:35:06] amen before the destruction in Noah's
[1:35:09] day Enoch was raptured he was the
[1:35:13] seventh from Adam
[1:35:15] we are here now like Enoch the seventh
[1:35:18] from the second Adam
[1:35:20] so he again we in the seventh age is
[1:35:23] when God takes some people in a rapture
[1:35:26] and and of course Noah was a type of the
[1:35:30] 144 000 who were sealed in passing
[1:35:33] through the Judgment Waters into the
[1:35:35] Millennium remember the the foolish
[1:35:38] virgin the Gentile Remnant they go
[1:35:41] through the tribulation they die but
[1:35:43] they wait until the thousand years is
[1:35:45] finished to be resurrected and that
[1:35:47] white Throne judgment they are given
[1:35:49] life
[1:35:50] but but the Jews will be there in the
[1:35:53] Millennium with us at 144 000 because
[1:35:56] they are the remnant of the Bride the
[1:35:59] leftover of the Old Testament
[1:36:02] and so in the days of Sodom we also see
[1:36:06] lot was saved from fire he was a
[1:36:09] righteous man which is a type of
[1:36:12] tribulation Saints and Abraham who was
[1:36:16] who the angel stayed with revealing the
[1:36:19] mysteries of giving the promise of the
[1:36:22] coming son
[1:36:24] if you have noticed in the days of of
[1:36:27] Abraham the promised son was promised in
[1:36:31] the days of Enoch he had a message how
[1:36:35] many knows what that message was in the
[1:36:37] book of Jude said that that Enoch said

[1:49:48] people have had Faith down to the ages
[1:49:52] but you're required in perfect faith
[1:49:56] brother Branham would preach the sermon
[1:49:58] perfect faith
[1:50:03] what's what he said now he appeared to
[1:50:05] us in the same form as he did to them in
[1:50:08] the Old Testament
[1:50:09] and in the same as he did in the New
[1:50:13] Testament and it showed by the same word
[1:50:15] the same Christ and I declare to you
[1:50:19] that Christ is the holy ghost that where
[1:50:22] Christ means the anointed one and just a
[1:50:25] person that is Anointed that's the
[1:50:27] Christ the anointed one how many knows
[1:50:29] that's true that's the that's the
[1:50:32] interpret the anointed one that there
[1:50:34] would be a man that would be anointed
[1:50:36] anointed by what the Bible said in Acts
[1:50:39] 2 that Jesus and Nazareth a man approved
[1:50:43] of God anointed by the Holy Ghost went
[1:50:46] about and done great works and things
[1:50:48] see that God manifested prove that he
[1:50:52] that he is in this man and we become
[1:50:56] Anointed with that same spirit
[1:51:00] anointed Messiahs
[1:51:02] Messiahs of this last day to sign forth
[1:51:06] the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show
[1:51:09] that he's not there
[1:51:10] but he's in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:12] and he is in his people moving among his
[1:51:16] bride with a love affair to her pouring
[1:51:20] out into her himself and to becoming one
[1:51:24] for the wedding supper and the great
[1:51:26] same signs promised by the same God in
[1:51:30] the same word is making his same
[1:51:32] manifestation and there's nothing left
[1:51:35] for us to do but believe it
[1:51:38] [Applause]
[1:51:40] Hallelujah nothing left for you to do
[1:51:43] but let's believe it God said I'm going
[1:51:46] to do this amen that's his grace upon
[1:51:49] you I feel to tell you sister that Grace
[1:51:52] is still upon you this morning that
[1:51:54] Grace that delivered you is that same
[1:51:57] Grace that will meet your needs as you
[1:51:59] come in this house this morning and
[1:52:01] answer the desires of your heart
[1:52:05] Hallelujah
[1:52:12] another Messiah
[1:52:15] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:52:18] for he hath anointed me and that same
[1:52:21] spirit is upon his bride
[1:52:24] Hallelujah
[1:52:27] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:52:28] [Applause]
[1:52:34] Hallelujah
[1:52:37] as God promised Sarah restoration
[1:52:40] necessary to bring forth Isaacs so God
[1:52:43] has sent a spirit and he used dust
[1:52:47] human flesh to bring us a message
[1:52:50] he could have chose the Stars the Sun
[1:52:53] the moon he could but he chose men to
[1:52:56] bring his word through
[1:52:58] sending a prophet but that's who the
[1:53:00] word comes through God chose to gift him
[1:53:03] to vindicate him first
[1:53:06] first he sent with gifts to prove he's
[1:53:09] from God
[1:53:10] and then and then the the first was
[1:53:13] healing the second phase of this
[1:53:15] ministry was prophesying Discerning of
[1:53:19] the thoughts and intents of heart
[1:53:22] and I'm talking about the messenger of
[1:53:25] Malachi 4 now brother Branham the the
[1:53:27] seventh angel God sent a prophet
[1:53:30] first to vindicate him with healing
[1:53:34] and then after that healing discernment
[1:53:38] amen
[1:53:40] Discerning the harps
[1:53:44] God still does that
[1:53:47] he still does that he knows exactly how
[1:53:50] to do that
[1:53:51] he still discerned the thoughts and
[1:53:54] intents of the heart
[1:53:56] amen
[1:53:57] Amen Let me let me just say this little
[1:53:59] sister was in the in the floor she'd
[1:54:02] been went from church to church one gun
[1:54:05] eating Deliverance there a demon Spirit
[1:54:07] had rebounded and there in Youth Camp
[1:54:10] she wallowed on the floor
[1:54:12] but God gave a word that delivered her
[1:54:16] and she still delivered
[1:54:19] still set free
[1:54:21] amen why because of saints and a man is
[1:54:25] still working in his church
[1:54:28] did by the angel the cast out Devils
[1:54:31] that speaks with new tongues that kills
[1:54:34] the sick he's still the same God
[1:54:37] refreshing himself yet bright form
[1:54:40] [Applause]
[1:54:47] let me go back over this one more time
[1:54:51] I don't know how much of this message
[1:54:52] I'll get through maybe a part three to
[1:54:55] it
[1:54:59] it's already went totally different than
[1:55:01] what I thought
[1:55:04] I never expected to go through and break
[1:55:07] down every part of Revelation 10 and all
[1:55:09] of that for you
[1:55:12] but just following the leadership of the
[1:55:14] spirit of God to let it direct to you so
[1:55:17] you will catch it
[1:55:19] to give you a crave for the Hunger for
[1:55:21] it this message there is revealing it's
[1:55:25] Christ The Mystery of God to be aware in
[1:55:28] bright form
[1:55:28] [Applause]
[1:55:30] God and his people
[1:55:35] notice
[1:55:37] when he would as I said he could choose
[1:55:39] the Stars the Moon
[1:55:41] the Sun but he chose men to bring his
[1:55:44] word through God but in this day use a
[1:55:48] prophet
[1:55:50] and he would choose to gift him to
[1:55:52] vindicate him first
[1:55:54] was signed said he would set from God
[1:55:58] in fact to the matter is Gordon Lindsay
[1:56:01] would write the book A man sent from God
[1:56:04] they criticized brother randomly the
[1:56:06] same people now and say oh he made
[1:56:08] himself a prophet and he made himself
[1:56:11] John the Baptist no they said
[1:56:14] he was a man sent from God it was their
[1:56:18] prophets that rose up and spoke in
[1:56:20] tongues and interpreted and said this
[1:56:22] that this ministry was a Ministry to
[1:56:25] forerun the second coming of Christ
[1:56:32] ask John the Baptist
[1:56:36] so well brother Brandon made himself a
[1:56:38] light said no even the Pentecostal
[1:56:40] prophets declared he was Elijah even
[1:56:43] Gordon Lindsay said he's like John a man
[1:56:46] sent from God
[1:56:49] came in the spirit and the power of
[1:56:51] Elias
[1:56:52] the first was healing second phases
[1:56:55] Ministry was prophesying Discerning the
[1:56:59] thoughts and into his heart thousands
[1:57:01] upon thousands of times and never fail
[1:57:03] him
[1:57:05] as in Sarah's day the Lord stood there
[1:57:08] wrapped in dust
[1:57:10] I can remember
[1:57:12] and I'm really not that old
[1:57:15] I'm one of these young people that
[1:57:17] stayed with me
[1:57:18] I thought I'd be by myself thank you
[1:57:20] boys for staying home with me
[1:57:22] no I would have loved for you to be in
[1:57:24] the youth meeting that had been great
[1:57:28] but then I'd have had to go
[1:57:34] but in Sarah's day
[1:57:38] the Lord stood there wrapped in dust
[1:57:42] and as I said
[1:57:43] I stood there as a young boy
[1:57:46] and seen a prophet turn around
[1:57:49] and call people out in the audience
[1:57:52] saying as it was in the days of Sodom
[1:57:56] and tell them that they're behind my
[1:57:59] back like it was when the angel stood
[1:58:01] there
[1:58:02] the same Angel is now here
[1:58:05] is using my flesh and my voice to speak
[1:58:09] to you and that man there has this
[1:58:12] problem and that problem and that's his
[1:58:14] name and that's her name
[1:58:18] what was it it was God showing us a sign
[1:58:22] that the son of man was present that the
[1:58:25] word had come
[1:58:27] and it was coming to a prophet
[1:58:33] and he shows a sign to Sarah
[1:58:35] in the tent behind him
[1:58:37] where is Sarah calls her name

[2:01:33] everything
[2:01:38] as Sarah
[2:01:39] and Sarah's day
[2:01:41] the Lord stood there
[2:01:43] wrapped in dust
[2:01:46] that's why we call him son of man
[2:01:48] of dust
[2:01:51] stood before her
[2:01:54] tent
[2:01:56] called her name
[2:01:58] discern
[2:02:00] the thoughts of her heart
[2:02:02] when she laughed at the words of the
[2:02:04] angel
[2:02:05] and that's a discernment
[2:02:08] God spoke to Abraham showing him the
[2:02:10] Mysteries
[2:02:11] I want you to get this
[2:02:14] Genesis 18 17.
[2:02:17] what they had just him blazing your
[2:02:19] heart this morning
[2:02:21] he comes and appears in disappearing I
[2:02:24] want you to notice he preached he tells
[2:02:26] of a rapture
[2:02:27] or a body change of the promised son
[2:02:31] and notice now what he says they hear he
[2:02:35] says shall I hide from Abraham the thing
[2:02:37] which I do
[2:02:40] in other words here I'm gonna unveil the
[2:02:43] Mysteries to him
[2:02:45] I'm gonna give him I'm gonna impart
[2:02:47] Revelation if you see it was more than
[2:02:50] just giving a promise he was in party
[2:02:52] the mysteries of God
[2:02:55] shall I hide from him the thing which I
[2:02:58] do
[2:03:00] oh
[2:03:02] we're in the third phase of the
[2:03:05] prophet's Ministry which is the opening
[2:03:08] of the word
[2:03:11] in the anointed ones at the end time
[2:03:13] brother Branham tells us and he says
[2:03:16] this in several parts he said the
[2:03:18] message speaks of his message not when I
[2:03:20] started out in the Divine Healing but
[2:03:23] when I begin to declare when he began to
[2:03:25] declare his message you see the first
[2:03:28] Paul healing second pull prophesying
[2:03:32] third pull opening of the word the
[2:03:35] Mysteries revealed
[2:03:37] no more there's no more higher order
[2:03:39] than to reveal the words and Prophets
[2:03:42] and the only way a prophet can be
[2:03:44] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[2:03:46] the third poll was the opening of them
[2:03:49] Seven Seals to reveal the Hidden Truths
[2:03:53] that's been sealed in the word
[2:03:56] so let's catch it for a minute let's say
[2:03:58] make sure nobody misses
[2:04:00] brother Branham calls it third pull
[2:04:02] first pull second pull what's he talking
[2:04:05] about
[2:04:06] he'd had a vision
[2:04:08] he had a vision there of him fishing in
[2:04:12] a in a a big beautiful Clear Lake
[2:04:17] in there he saw rainbow trout great big
[2:04:21] trophy ones
[2:04:23] rainbow remember it's a symbolic Vision
[2:04:27] it's a vision of symbols he's fishing
[2:04:30] which represents his ministry
[2:04:33] he's making cast to catch which is
[2:04:36] preaching the word
[2:04:38] and as he is doing it there he sees fish
[2:04:42] there that that he he wants to catch he
[2:04:46] said you know there was he looked around
[2:04:48] and there was a bunch of ministers and
[2:04:50] they were catching little bitty fish
[2:04:52] but he said I wanted to catch that
[2:04:55] Covenant people
[2:04:56] the people of the Covenant the fish of
[2:05:00] the Covenant I I wanted to catch them I
[2:05:03] wanted to get that trophy you know every
[2:05:05] ages wanted to bring the trophy
[2:05:09] amen and Elizabeth caught a little fish
[2:05:11] wasn't growed up yet
[2:05:14] Wesley caught up a little fish he wasn't
[2:05:16] grown up yet
[2:05:18] but he said I want those that are alive
[2:05:20] and remain at the coming of the Lord
[2:05:21] that that trophy people that people that
[2:05:25] will be the bride that were at Pentecost
[2:05:27] was showing the full colors of the
[2:05:29] rainbow I want them to have every bit of
[2:05:32] the word in power
[2:05:34] I want to catch that that's what I want
[2:05:37] to catch let that be the trophy of my
[2:05:40] Ministry
[2:05:44] and the angel comes and says
[2:05:48] let me teach you how to fish
[2:05:53] and he says
[2:05:55] he said what you do he said his cast way
[2:05:58] out into the deep
[2:05:59] he said now you make that first little
[2:06:01] Paul and he said that will attract
[2:06:03] little fish lots of little fish
[2:06:06] and that was what his first Ministry did
[2:06:08] you talk about entertaining
[2:06:12] it was in a tendency blind eyes open
[2:06:15] cripples walk
[2:06:17] hey you'd run you'd you'd sleep out on
[2:06:20] your car to watch all of that
[2:06:23] get be in their first get on the first
[2:06:25] Pew you wouldn't give it up you'd get
[2:06:27] you a sandwich and sit there day and
[2:06:29] night they did
[2:06:32] it's quite entertaining it got a lot of
[2:06:34] little fish
[2:06:37] but it didn't produce the Covenant
[2:06:39] people
[2:06:41] amen so again you know they had a lot of
[2:06:45] people that came and with big crowds
[2:06:49] well you know big crowds big money
[2:06:53] that's what the evangelists would later
[2:06:55] find out oral Robertson and all of them
[2:06:58] you know they say well we know when it's
[2:07:00] time it wasn't Robertson said this but
[2:07:02] one of them would say you know we know
[2:07:03] when it's when it's time for us to leave
[2:07:05] a city said when we've taken up the
[2:07:07] offerings and then finally we stood them
[2:07:09] up on their head and pulled them up and
[2:07:12] down and shook them to all the chains
[2:07:13] fell out of their pockets then we knew
[2:07:15] it was time to move on to the next one
[2:07:18] it became about numbers
[2:07:20] and money
[2:07:25] and God says
[2:07:27] I'm going to give you a greater gift
[2:07:31] and one day in Regina
[2:07:34] Canada
[2:07:37] he had seen it by a vision before
[2:07:40] there come my person walks up to him
[2:07:45] and this time instead of
[2:07:47] the sign in the hand
[2:07:49] he knew her name knew her address knew
[2:07:52] where she's from what her trouble was
[2:07:54] there was nothing hidden
[2:07:59] now it was discerning
[2:08:05] and you know what the results was there
[2:08:07] were fewer people ministered to
[2:08:11] so you know what second police said
[2:08:14] would scatter them
[2:08:17] and it did
[2:08:19] his meetings got smaller
[2:08:22] there were fewer people came
[2:08:25] they would still have him because of his
[2:08:27] signed gift
[2:08:28] to show discernment it was a great thing
[2:08:30] but you know because there were less
[2:08:33] miracles
[2:08:35] and less people ministered to there was
[2:08:37] less healings
[2:08:39] so fewer people started coming you know
[2:08:42] fewer people were coming
[2:08:44] now I'm just going to say if that listen
[2:08:48] listen when I was there in 65 brother
[2:08:50] Brandon still had the sign in his hand
[2:08:54] he can still take somebody with his left
[2:08:57] hand and them there by by their hand
[2:09:00] give me that hand right there and hold
[2:09:03] it there and there on his only his hand
[2:09:06] would go bumps that would start moving
[2:09:09] if there was a uh if there was a germ
[2:09:13] disease in there it would start moving
[2:09:16] little white bumps and he could tell by
[2:09:18] the way that it moved and the rapid and
[2:09:20] the distance what kind of disease it was
[2:09:25] that sign was still there
[2:09:27] what am I telling you he still had the
[2:09:30] ability
[2:09:31] to go back to the first sign
[2:09:34] with more people more money bigger
[2:09:37] crowds come on greater popularity
[2:09:41] but he kept showing this other sign
[2:09:44] of discernment
[2:09:47] and brother Brandon said himself I
[2:09:48] wondered why this sign was greater than
[2:09:53] the first sign because the age of God
[2:09:54] said it was greater why was this and
[2:09:57] greater he said you know that the
[2:09:59] wheelchair zipped him out and and all
[2:10:02] the sick people being here why was this
[2:10:04] a greater sign when there was less
[2:10:05] people ministered to and less Miracles
[2:10:08] because he said it was a sign that the
[2:10:11] son of man of Christ himself the word
[2:10:15] was present
[2:10:16] [Applause]
[2:10:18] and God was given Witness
[2:10:22] come on Church give him witness at the
[2:10:25] same one that stood there in the day of
[2:10:27] Peter and said I your your name is
[2:10:29] cephas you're the son of Jonas I'm going
[2:10:32] to call you Peter
[2:10:35] amen called he said that the others call
[2:10:38] the woman at the well when she'd leave
[2:10:40] her pots after being told of her life
[2:10:42] all these other days listen discern the
[2:10:45] heart what was it it was shown it's the
[2:10:47] ministry of Christ was repeating again
[2:10:51] for a former rain to come as a teaching
[2:10:55] Reign to bring back the way to us
[2:11:01] and he said I wondered why that was
[2:11:04] great let me tell you if this would have
[2:11:06] been A.A Allen either or oral Robert
[2:11:09] said it went back to that first gift in
[2:11:11] heartbeat
[2:11:16] because it was all about if you ever
[2:11:18] watched oral it was all about the man of
[2:11:20] the hour
[2:11:26] if you ever watch the island
[2:11:28] men got into Spears they didn't even
[2:11:30] belong until they become drugs and
[2:11:32] alcoholics
[2:11:40] and here God sent a prophet and all
[2:11:43] these impersonators follow
[2:11:46] all Roberts would go forth and plant the
[2:11:48] seeds of Pentecostalism
[2:11:50] until there is 0.6 billion of them today
[2:12:00] but he said the third pull
[2:12:03] was the opening of them Seven Seals
[2:12:06] to reveal the Hidden Truths that's been
[2:12:09] sealed in the word
[2:12:12] the third pull
[2:12:14] was the opening of the word the
[2:12:17] Mysteries revealed
[2:12:19] it would be that
[2:12:21] which would catch
[2:12:23] it would be that hook
[2:12:28] that would catch the Covenant people
[2:12:31] so brother Branham you know went out and
[2:12:33] and in the vision you remember what
[2:12:36] happened you know he came cast out and
[2:12:38] the angel said don't tell nobody what
[2:12:40] you're doing
[2:12:41] and they come along and they pat him on
[2:12:43] the back and the minister said brother
[2:12:45] Bradham ain't nobody no nobody a
[2:12:47] fisherman like you are you're the
[2:12:49] greatest this and that patent him on the
[2:12:51] back and said you can do it brother
[2:12:52] Branham and he got excited
[2:12:55] and made the pull when he wasn't
[2:12:56] supposed to he caught a little fish like
[2:12:58] the rest of them
[2:13:04] but he was told
[2:13:07] the third pull
[2:13:10] will catch
[2:13:12] the Covenant people
[2:13:15] the third phase of his ministry which is
[2:13:18] rejected
[2:13:20] the one the face the faces they love oh
[2:13:24] my goodness Gifted Man oh you know
[2:13:26] anointed of God healings and miracles
[2:13:29] and signs and wonders and then that
[2:13:30] discernment no there's it's never been
[2:13:33] never been one like it and listen it
[2:13:35] hadn't been in a continuous Ministry
[2:13:38] since the days of Christ
[2:13:40] I don't mean that there wasn't a man
[2:13:42] that every once in a while would get a
[2:13:44] word of knowledge or something and know
[2:13:45] something about somebody or you know and
[2:13:47] and symptoms but over and over and over
[2:13:50] and over and over and over and over and
[2:13:52] over again
[2:13:55] that's right continuous Ministry
[2:13:58] to show us to vindicate us the word was
[2:14:01] here
[2:14:04] now so the third pull he said is the
[2:14:08] third phase or the third part of his
[2:14:10] ministry would be the opening of the
[2:14:13] word the opening of those Seven Seals it
[2:14:15] would be that
[2:14:17] that would catch the elect
[2:14:21] the Covenant people
[2:14:23] in perfect faith
[2:14:25] brother Branham says this is coming to
[2:14:27] that third pull I went to all that to
[2:14:29] explain about the three pulls that's the
[2:14:32] part that we're in today we are in the
[2:14:35] third phase of brother bradham's
[2:14:37] Ministry
[2:14:38] where the word has been opened to bride
[2:14:40] people
[2:14:41] this is this is coming into that third
[2:14:43] poll I believe in it I want to ask you a
[2:14:46] sincere question you that passed through
[2:14:48] the prayer line can you actually believe
[2:14:49] and feel like that now there's something
[2:14:51] happening you since hands were laid on
[2:14:53] you raise your hands that's what we
[2:14:55] waited for this is just starting to
[2:14:57] bloom now it's just starting to bloom I
[2:14:59] did this for a purpose I'm working out
[2:15:01] something that's taking this charge of
[2:15:02] faith and going right back to begin and
[2:15:05] come in and to kind of raise faith in a
[2:15:07] bracket where you've never noticed it
[2:15:09] before that way not a faith but a
[2:15:12] perfect faith
[2:15:13] notice what the opening of the word is
[2:15:16] to produce a not just a face
[2:15:20] but a perfect faith
[2:15:23] and he said uh built it up in here
[2:15:26] what's a perfect god with a perfect
[2:15:28] heart with a keep a perfect promise my
[2:15:30] perfect word which is sharper than a
[2:15:33] two-edged sword and a discernment of the
[2:15:35] thoughts and into his heart we're coming
[2:15:37] now to Perfection because the people has
[2:15:40] to come to this in order for Rapture
[2:15:43] that's what's holding it away right now
[2:15:46] is waiting for that church to come into
[2:15:49] that perfect raptured faith
[2:15:54] and it means a lot of shaking down for
[2:15:57] me it means a lot for you but together
[2:16:01] we'll make it by the grace of God
[2:16:05] I just say God shake me
[2:16:08] Shake every bit of unbelief out
[2:16:11] every bit of Darkness everything that
[2:16:14] ain't like you shake it out of me Lord
[2:16:17] amen until that there resides within me
[2:16:20] a perfect Faith amen because people has
[2:16:23] to come to this in order for a rapture
[2:16:27] now this is the purpose I did it he said
[2:16:30] it's taking this charge of Faith to
[2:16:33] raise faith in a bracket wherever you
[2:16:35] never noticed it that way before not a
[2:16:38] faith but a perfect faith
[2:16:41] you see the word has come to empower us
[2:16:46] the word has come to bring us back to
[2:16:49] Faith again this is what he would come
[2:16:52] to Sarah where Sarah would be asked is
[2:16:55] there anything too hard for the Lord and
[2:16:58] then she would judge him faithful that
[2:17:01] made the promise you see it came the
[2:17:03] message of the son of man was coming to
[2:17:05] turn her heart back to believing again
[2:17:08] so our commission is to cast out Devils
[2:17:11] to lay hands on the sick and they shall
[2:17:14] recover you will make serpents powerless
[2:17:18] the poison that Satan has used against
[2:17:20] you he will render harmless
[2:17:26] Hallelujah take that down in your heart
[2:17:28] to this morning the poison that he is
[2:17:31] designed against you
[2:17:35] that he's been waiting to bite you and
[2:17:38] you have been bitten by it
[2:17:41] I want you to know the poison that Satan
[2:17:44] uses against you will be rendered
[2:17:47] powerless
[2:17:49] Hallelujah fulfilling the scripture no
[2:17:52] weapon that has been farmed against you
[2:17:55] shall prosper
[2:17:58] no matter what the devil is trying to do
[2:18:00] for you to you no matter how you were
[2:18:03] born no matter what your past no matter
[2:18:06] what your situation the poison that has
[2:18:09] been against you
[2:18:11] will be rendered Palace because we are
[2:18:15] under a Great Commission
[2:18:17] [Applause]
[2:18:20] remember I ended on this last Sunday
[2:18:23] where that when the apostles followed
[2:18:25] his first commission he said I behold
[2:18:29] Satan lets lightning fall from Heaven
[2:18:32] Luke 10 18. put that up there Luke 10
[2:18:35] 18. I beheld do you know that this is
[2:18:39] not the only time
[2:18:41] that a people is going to behold Satan
[2:18:43] falling from heaven
[2:18:46] Jesus said when they come back and said
[2:18:49] the devils are subject to us we cast
[2:18:52] them out in your name
[2:18:55] come on this is still under the blood of
[2:18:57] bulls and goats by the commission gave
[2:18:58] by Jesus how much more now good blood of
[2:19:01] Jesus Christ takes away every sin and
[2:19:04] you stand Justified
[2:19:07] you never did it in the first place
[2:19:10] and God's thinking before the world
[2:19:12] began listen and he said I beheld Satan
[2:19:16] as lightning fall from Heaven do you
[2:19:18] know it's prophesied in Revelation 12
[2:19:22] that Satan again will stop
[2:19:25] from heaven in fact of the matter he
[2:19:28] will be cast out of heaven
[2:19:30] [Applause]
[2:19:35] the Bible said we wrestle not against
[2:19:37] flesh and blood
[2:19:39] but against principalities hold that
[2:19:41] scripture up for me right there just
[2:19:42] keep that
[2:19:43] against principalities and powers and
[2:19:46] rulers of darkness in high places
[2:19:51] King James doesn't always do us a favor
[2:19:54] it is translated that word Heavenly
[2:19:57] places every other time
[2:19:59] so he said we wrestle not against flesh
[2:20:02] and blood
[2:20:03] but against principalities and powers
[2:20:06] and rulers of darkness in Heavenly
[2:20:10] places
[2:20:12] what does that mean that means that
[2:20:15] every time you start to take your
[2:20:18] position
[2:20:20] as a son or daughter of God
[2:20:23] Satan is there to oppose you
[2:20:27] oh brother Tim I got prayed for I ain't
[2:20:29] gonna get prayed for again I'll tell you
[2:20:31] that the devil's been biting me well
[2:20:33] brother we started the battle when we
[2:20:35] prayed for you
[2:20:38] as long as you were just happy to live
[2:20:41] with that devil come on
[2:20:42] amen it didn't matter but brother the
[2:20:45] moment that we began praying
[2:20:48] Satan had to move and roll out of his
[2:20:52] bed to deal with you
[2:20:55] come on because you were coming before
[2:20:58] the throne of grace and you were
[2:21:00] demanding your rights as the child of
[2:21:03] God my righteous healing my righteous
[2:21:06] salvation my rights and salvation for my
[2:21:09] children by right
[2:21:11] captain Black Jesus you pay for it
[2:21:19] so the moment you start moving

[2:21:28] them those Prime Ministers of Israel
[2:21:31] they can get along just fine
[2:21:34] I mean yeah there'll be a few
[2:21:36] squirmishes and fusses and this and that
[2:21:38] and the other
[2:21:42] but let them head toward Temple mount
[2:21:47] let one of them dare
[2:21:50] welcome Temple mount
[2:21:55] ever Arab will come out of the Woodworks
[2:21:58] screaming yelling violence rioting
[2:22:02] tearing down disrupted don't you dare
[2:22:05] your Jews have no right to this holy
[2:22:07] place and it is their rights
[2:22:11] and I want you to know the devil does
[2:22:13] the same thing to you every time you
[2:22:15] move toward your position of censorship
[2:22:18] the Devil comes along to oppose you and
[2:22:21] say he sinned he did this he did that he
[2:22:24] did another
[2:22:26] he made that mistake come on you know
[2:22:28] that every time the Devil comes to you

[2:22:37] know you know how many mistakes you made
[2:22:38] with him you have no rights
[2:22:42] and he'll howl and he'll scream and
[2:22:45] he'll yell
[2:22:50] the moment you start stepping on a
[2:22:52] promise
[2:22:54] you start moving up in your position in
[2:22:57] Christ and taking your place of sonship
[2:22:59] every devil in hell goes to howling
[2:23:02] [Applause]
[2:23:04] trying to Buffalo you and and they're

[2:23:13] know they're the accuser of the brethren
[2:23:16] by the way they're not all lives either
[2:23:18] they're things you really did
[2:23:20] and he's coming and accusing you and
[2:23:22] said you have no right because of what
[2:23:25] you did but Jesus hallelujah amen he's
[2:23:29] her attorney
[2:23:31] that man in his blood and her seeds for
[2:23:33] us
[2:23:34] are you with me amen and he is seating
[2:23:38] of your behalf heaven to save you from
[2:23:41] the accuser of the brother and said let
[2:23:43] all their sins be on me let them free
[2:23:47] that's
[2:23:52] [Applause]
[2:23:56] to it
[2:24:00] [Applause]
[2:24:08] great
[2:24:12] this is his first Commission
[2:24:15] in his last Commission
[2:24:23] go with me to revelation 12.
[2:24:28] I can preach
[2:24:29] I could preach a whole nother sermon on
[2:24:31] this
[2:24:36] you go in Revelation 12 there's a woman
[2:24:38] Israel
[2:24:39] clothed with the Sun
[2:24:41] that's the gospel ahead of her
[2:24:44] she's about to bring forth a Munch Man
[2:24:46] Child the moon's the law which is a
[2:24:48] shadow of things that comes under her
[2:24:49] feet
[2:24:50] upon her head or 12 Stars which is the
[2:24:53] 12 Patriarchs
[2:24:56] she being with child she's expecting
[2:24:58] Jesus to come she cries
[2:25:00] prevailing with birth in birth and pain
[2:25:03] to be delivered verse 3. now there
[2:25:06] appears another Wonder in heaven
[2:25:09] and it's behold the great red dragon and
[2:25:12] he's got seven heads and ten horns and
[2:25:14] seven crowns upon his heads
[2:25:16] and just tell Drew that there are parts
[2:25:18] of the stars of Heaven he's a Deceiver
[2:25:21] brother Brandon would always say about
[2:25:22] this it wasn't his t-a-i-l it was a
[2:25:25] t-a-l-e that he told
[2:25:29] the tale he told angels and the tale he
[2:25:32] told Eve and the tale he tells you
[2:25:37] and notice what he says his tail drew a
[2:25:40] third part of the stars of Heaven that
[2:25:42] cast him to the earth and the dragon
[2:25:44] stood before them the woman which was
[2:25:46] ready to be delivered for devour her
[2:25:49] child as soon he was born and she
[2:25:51] brought forth a man child that was Jesus
[2:25:54] Christ who was to rule all nations with
[2:25:56] the rod of iron this is the millennium
[2:25:58] and her child was caught up unto God and
[2:26:02] to his throne so you see God took him
[2:26:05] from here took him to his throne it was
[2:26:08] a Rapture that took place and the woman
[2:26:10] goes into the wilderness
[2:26:13] where she has a place prepared of God
[2:26:15] that they should feed her there a
[2:26:17] thousand and two hundred and three score
[2:26:18] days
[2:26:19] if you would look right here in
[2:26:21] Revelation
[2:26:22] here
[2:26:24] from from revelation 5.
[2:26:28] to Revelations
[2:26:30] verse 6.
[2:26:32] 12 and 6.
[2:26:34] from that period in their
[2:26:38] to the beginning of the and in there
[2:26:41] is two thousand years of Gentiles
[2:26:45] because from the Rapture of Christ
[2:26:48] to where the woman is seen again is when
[2:26:52] that she's in a Wilderness when God
[2:26:54] recognizes Israel
[2:26:57] as a nation
[2:26:59] and they feed her there three and a half
[2:27:02] years
[2:27:06] so there's three and a half years left
[2:27:08] to the Jews now follow this along the
[2:27:10] line
[2:27:12] and there was war in heaven
[2:27:16] now Satan turns back to heaven this is
[2:27:19] our day
[2:27:21] because I just told you that Jesus said
[2:27:25] have you ever have you ever noticed when
[2:27:28] a big thunderstorm comes through and
[2:27:30] tornadoes and what do you know what it's
[2:27:32] heavens
[2:27:34] and they're having a battle there
[2:27:36] the big cold front will come from this
[2:27:38] way in the warm front here and they'll
[2:27:40] meet in a in a common Battleground and
[2:27:43] there will be lightning and Thunders and
[2:27:45] ferocious winds and tornadoes and
[2:27:48] everything else I mean the heavens will
[2:27:51] be on fire until one of them wins
[2:28:00] and the Bible tells you and there was
[2:28:02] war in heaven
[2:28:05] Michael which is who is like Jehovah
[2:28:09] he and his angels fought against the
[2:28:12] dragon and the dragon fought in his
[2:28:15] angel now there is a war that starts in
[2:28:18] heaven
[2:28:20] amen listen we're coming back again I
[2:28:23] saw I saw lightning Satan ball is
[2:28:27] lightning from heaven
[2:28:30] with Devils were cast out now in the end
[2:28:34] time there was to be a war in the heaven
[2:28:36] and Michael and his angels fought
[2:28:38] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[2:28:40] in his angels
[2:28:45] are you ready for this
[2:28:48] amen and
[2:28:50] Prevail not
[2:28:54] Hallelujah the script is already roped
[2:28:57] as to who's going to win
[2:28:59] you are not losers Little Children You
[2:29:02] are the winners
[2:29:04] Hallelujah because he prevailed now
[2:29:08] that's not saith the Lord the devil
[2:29:12] that's against you will not win
[2:29:17] Hallelujah I don't care how much noise
[2:29:20] how much lightning how much disturbance
[2:29:22] how much he deserves to win how much he
[2:29:25] create the atmosphere and tornadoes and
[2:29:28] passes he will not win
[2:29:32] I don't care how long you've been in a
[2:29:34] battle I don't care how hard it's rained
[2:29:37] he will not win he prevails not
[2:29:45] Hallelujah neither was their place found
[2:29:49] any more in heaven
[2:29:53] Hallelujah because he has no right to
[2:29:57] stay there in your position
[2:29:59] [Applause]
[2:30:02] when son to God appeared before about
[2:30:06] before job before God in the days of job
[2:30:09] Satan appeared there among them
[2:30:12] amen come on Church
[2:30:15] amen when when there's in zechariah's
[2:30:18] day when when they when the when the
[2:30:20] when when the Satan there appeared and
[2:30:23] he and there was an anointed priest that
[2:30:25] would stand there Satan came among them
[2:30:29] Hallelujah but I want you to understand
[2:30:31] if this place
[2:30:34] Satan gets cast out neither was their
[2:30:38] place found any more in heaven somebody
[2:30:42] ought to shout about that
[2:30:46] because the devil don't belong there yes
[2:30:49] give it on there he has no right to
[2:30:52] stand there and say anything against you
[2:30:55] in the blood of Jesus Christ has
[2:30:57] canceled ever said and dare you it in
[2:31:00] you he ever been in the evidence is gone
[2:31:04] hey
[2:31:09] hey
[2:31:14] and prevailed not and neither was her
[2:31:16] place found anymore in heaven
[2:31:18] next verse
[2:31:20] and the Great Dragon
[2:31:23] was cast out
[2:31:26] not you because you got a right to be
[2:31:27] there
[2:31:29] and that old serpent oh yeah
[2:31:32] that old servant let's call him what he
[2:31:34] is the old ancient serpent called the
[2:31:38] devil and Satan which deceiveth all the
[2:31:40] world he was cast out of the earth and
[2:31:43] his angels were cast out with him
[2:31:48] now this is when the Dynamics will come
[2:31:50] satanic Dynamics will come to the
[2:31:52] mechanics that are already set in place
[2:31:54] for the mark of the beast
[2:31:59] but it's not for you to worry about
[2:32:02] it because as Satan comes down
[2:32:06] you are going up
[2:32:09] you are not a part of the Fallen World
[2:32:14] you are part of the ascending bride did
[2:32:18] you get that a Rapture is an Ascension
[2:32:21] hey yeah
[2:32:22] come on you go back to the days of Enoch
[2:32:25] did he build a pyramid
[2:32:27] that pyramid was called the place of
[2:32:30] Ascension
[2:32:31] and it didn't build it for a graveyard
[2:32:34] he built it for a place to ascend that
[2:32:37] when the Capstone comes or the time of
[2:32:39] people who would match the coming Christ
[2:32:42] and would Ascend and it's a place to
[2:32:45] ascend it from
[2:32:48] but
[2:32:49] the Pharaohs and denominational men make
[2:32:53] it into a graveyard full of dead men's
[2:32:56] monks
[2:32:58] but we're coming back to a place where
[2:33:02] the pyramid has been cleansed from the
[2:33:05] Creeds of man and it is now again a
[2:33:08] place of Ascension
[2:33:11] and we're not down here in the base
[2:33:13] we're all the way up at the top where
[2:33:16] the the final Stones match the coming
[2:33:19] Stone and the same Ministry that that
[2:33:22] that that that coming Stone had this
[2:33:24] this bride has the same Ministry and
[2:33:27] they match together
[2:33:31] and when she does all the dead in Christ
[2:33:33] from Seven Ages all down to the pyramid
[2:33:36] will rise
[2:33:37] from The Seven Ages
[2:33:40] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[2:33:42] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[2:33:44] was to see that the whole world and he
[2:33:46] was cast out into the Earth and his
[2:33:48] angels were cast out with him
[2:33:51] verse 10. and I heard a loud voice
[2:33:54] saying in heaven now it comes salvation
[2:33:57] what you know Salvation was 2 000 years
[2:34:00] ago when Jesus died
[2:34:02] but now here comes completed total
[2:34:05] salvation because this is redemption of
[2:34:08] our bodies now he's come salvation and
[2:34:11] strength oh Sarah didn't what do you
[2:34:13] need sweets at the Kingdom of our God
[2:34:16] the full power of the Holy Ghost the
[2:34:19] power of His Christ for the accuser of
[2:34:22] our Brethren is cast down which accused
[2:34:24] them before our God day and night
[2:34:29] Hallelujah God is shutting the mouth of
[2:34:32] your accuser

[2:34:38] overcame him now we understand who's

[2:34:46] human battles and he said at day

[2:34:52] an angel so it was you that it was shed
[2:34:55] far they overcame him by the blood of
[2:34:58] the lamb and by the word of their
[2:35:01] testimony and they love not their lives
