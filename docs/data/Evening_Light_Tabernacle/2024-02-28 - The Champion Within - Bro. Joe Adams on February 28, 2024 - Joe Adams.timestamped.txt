[29:13] would say tonight God we just yield
[29:16] ourselves both speaker and hearer Lord

[29:21] from the Great Mighty God that you are
[29:24] unchangeable God Unstoppable God lord
[29:27] What a Mighty God you are we bless your
[29:30] name tonight father may you just have
[29:31] the preeminence in this service but we
[29:34] ask it in Jesus name
[29:37] amen amen if you have your Bibles would
[29:39] look here in Romans 8 verse 31 as you're
[29:42] turning there just just wanted to greet
[29:45] you it's been a while since we've been
[29:46] here want to say thank you for your
[29:48] prayers for our families we was in
[29:50] Arizona for the funeral of sister
[29:52] Rachel's Brother David Jessica's Uncle
[29:55] we're we traveled 3600 miles round trip
[29:58] we actually went by Flagstaff and
[30:00] preached for brother Dell Smith uh
[30:03] Wednesday and Sunday and had tremendous
[30:04] Services there but you know it's nothing
[30:07] like being at
[30:08] home so y'all may want to get a picture
[30:10] of the four of us cuz this
[30:12] is this hadn't happened in quite some
[30:15] time probably since the first of the
[30:16] year so but we're glad to be back
[30:18] together I'm honored to serve the Lord
[30:20] with such Mighty Men of Valor and and to
[30:22] be among a church that believes the Full
[30:25] Gospel we look here tonight
[30:27] Romans 8:31 it says what shall we say to
[30:30] these things if God be for us then who
[30:32] can be against us he that spare not his
[30:35] own son but delivered him up for us all
[30:37] how shall he not with him also freely
[30:40] give us all things who shall lay
[30:43] anything to the charge of God's elect
[30:45] but it is God that justify who is he
[30:48] that condemneth it is Christ that died
[30:51] yay rather that is risen again who is
[30:53] even at the right hand of God who also
[30:56] maketh intercession ession for us who
[30:58] shall separate us from the love of
[31:00] Christ notice here Paul's bringing some
[31:02] distinct things to our attention who
[31:05] shall separate us from the love of
[31:06] Christ shall
[31:08] tribulation or distress or persecution
[31:12] all right Church come on this is not
[31:14] just the the ministers this is all of us
[31:16] our famine our nakedness our Peril our
[31:20] sword as it is written for thy sakes we
[31:23] are killed all the day long we are
[31:26] accounted sheep for the slaughter but
[31:29] nay in all these things we are more than
[31:31] conquered through him that loved us for
[31:33] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[31:36] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[31:39] power nor things present nor things to
[31:42] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[31:45] creature shall be able to separate us
[31:48] from the love of God which is in Christ
[31:50] Jesus our lord God bless you you can
[31:53] have your seats
[31:55] tonight want to look back here Romans
[31:57] 8:31 it
[31:59] says what shall we say to these things
[32:02] if God be for us then who can be against
[32:06] it who can come against us is God is is
[32:08] God if God is for us who can injure us
[32:11] who can destroy us notice all demonic
[32:14] powers of Hell may be against us tonight
[32:16] but the power they don't have the power
[32:19] to destroy us nor do they have the power
[32:21] to take away the blessings of God from
[32:23] us for what if God be for us then who
[32:27] can be against us God is more Mighty
[32:30] than all our foes he will defend us and
[32:33] he will save us the Bible tells us in
[32:35] Psalm 118 and verse 6 the Lord is on my
[32:39] side somebody needs to hear this tonight
[32:41] the Lord is on my side and I will not
[32:44] fear what man do unto me notice then he
[32:48] comes down in verse 35 who shall
[32:51] separate us and he goes into great
[32:53] detail tribulation or pressure from
[32:56] without
[32:57] Affliction arising from external sources
[33:00] or distress great anxiety and distress
[33:03] of Mind such as arises when man does not
[33:06] know where to turn himself or what to
[33:09] find uh to find
[33:11] relief excuse me or persecutions or
[33:15] famine because they were driven from
[33:16] their homes and yet we find what could
[33:19] Peril he said in Peril there is danger
[33:21] of any sort or danger of any kind or
[33:25] even the sword of persec should notice
[33:27] in all these things Paul says
[33:30] nay nay otherwise however otherwise but
[33:35] in all these things notice Paul is
[33:37] bringing it down no matter what you are
[33:39] facing no matter the situation no matter
[33:42] the trial or the sickness or the
[33:44] heartache or the despair or the anxiety
[33:47] or the fear or the loneliness in all
[33:50] these
[33:52] things now he's making it Global all
[33:54] these things we are notice Paul is

[34:46] it in our thoughts that we are not less
[34:49] than able but we're more than able amen

[35:12] beneath notice we are blessed and highly
[35:15] favored of Our Lord we are the ones that
[35:17] are going up not down that's
[35:20] right and he tells us notice we're more
[35:24] more than conquerors that word conquer

[35:54] more Victorious no matter what what

[36:21] have no power to sedo us
[36:24] tonight they don't have the power to
[36:26] take from you tonight the love of
[36:28] almighty god notice but through the
[36:30] trial through the situation Paul is
[36:32] telling us that that situation that God
[36:34] has brought you into will make you more
[36:37] than a conqueror tonight you'll be more
[36:40] [Applause]
[36:43] Victorious and notice where does it come
[36:46] from through
[36:48] him it says through him see all of our
[36:51] abundant victories they come through
[36:53] Christ they come from Christ they come
[36:56] through Christ and they're in Christ so
[36:59] he makes us more than
[37:02] conquerors see it's through Christ that
[37:04] we Prevail mightily it's through Christ
[37:07] that we have
[37:08] overpower overpowering Victory Zechariah
[37:12] 4 and verse 6 says then he answered and
[37:14] he spake unto me saying this is the word
[37:17] of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by
[37:21] might nor by power but by my spirit
[37:26] sayth the Lord of host we overcome by
[37:28] the spirit of God not by brute force not
[37:31] by Humanity not by big strapping muscles
[37:34] not by how intellectual you are but we
[37:36] overcome and we're more than conquerors
[37:38] notice through Christ and it's through
[37:41] Christ that we have the power to subdue
[37:45] we find in Philippians 4 and verse
[37:48] 13 he says I
[37:50] can how many of you can say that tonight
[37:53] I can what I can do all things not some
[37:57] things not the things that I'm just you
[38:00] know maybe I'm skilled to do but he says
[38:02] I can do all things tonight through
[38:04] Christ which strengthen me otherwise you
[38:07] can believe when nobody else will
[38:09] believe you can remain steadfast when
[38:12] people are falling away and drifting
[38:13] away you can remain why cuz I can do all
[38:16] things tonight Paul again is making it a
[38:19] personal a personal Vindication or or a
[38:21] personal invitation he's showing us that
[38:24] we as a Believer can do all things we
[38:26] can subdue Nations tonight we can subdue
[38:29] demonic forces tonight through Jesus
[38:31] Christ Our
[38:34] Lord notice it's through
[38:37] him that loved us so it's it all comes
[38:41] down to love and his love for us and

[38:50] fail because he loves us we are
[38:53] victorious because he loved us he sent
[38:56] Christ to die in your stead because he
[38:59] loved us he went to hell so we wouldn't

[41:38] matter what it may be he has already
[41:41] defeated that and the Bible say he's
[41:43] made you more than a conqueror tonight
[41:46] he's the champion but he's come and what
[41:49] has he done he has given us his holy
[41:51] ghost the token that we heard about
[41:53] Sunday and that Holy Ghost is on display
[41:55] to do what to make you a
[41:58] champion to make you a warrior to make
[42:01] you somebody that'll stand steadfast
[42:04] when everybody falls away you'll still
[42:06] stand and having done all the stand
[42:08] you're standing there for cuz you're
[42:10] standing for the truth of
[42:13] god notice now brother man will tell us
[42:15] like this he said then Satan can't stand
[42:18] that notice because he's a defeated
[42:21] being right oh he's a defeated being not
[42:26] going to be defeated he's already
[42:28] defeated brother
[42:29] Johnny he's nothing but a
[42:33] bluff well I sure wish you could remind
[42:35] me that when I'm in my trial I'm
[42:37] reminding you tonight he's nothing but a
[42:40] bluff Jesus Paid the price called us by
[42:43] his grace we're an air what a perfect
[42:46] setup that is wo he's already defeated I
[42:51] never defeated him Christ defeated him
[42:54] I'm just claiming my god-given
[42:57] privileges oh Hallelujah notice he tells
[43:00] us in John 16 and verse 7 nevertheless
[43:04] I'll tell you the
[43:06] truth it is expedient for you that I go
[43:09] away for if I go not away then the
[43:11] comforter will not come unto you but if
[43:14] I depart I will send him unto you so
[43:17] here we have a prophecy or we have a
[43:19] promise that God is going to send us a
[43:22] comforter he's going to send us the Holy
[43:25] Ghost because what he is he wants us to
[43:28] be so he's the champion and he's looking
[43:31] for other Champions to come on the
[43:33] scene notice we find here in John 14 and
[43:36] verse 16 and I will pray that the father
[43:40] and he shall give un he shall give you
[43:42] another comforter that he may abide with
[43:44] you forever even the spirit of Truth
[43:47] whom the world cannot receive because it
[43:49] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[43:52] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[43:55] shall be in you
[43:56] you then he goes on to say I will not
[43:59] leave you comfortless but I will come to
[44:02] you so Jesus is our champion and he sent
[44:05] his Spirit to come and live inside each
[44:08] and every one of us so that we too could
[44:10] be
[44:12] Champions so now I'm going to dive in a
[44:14] little bit tonight and I want to kind of
[44:16] bring some of this thought to you
[44:18] tonight what does it mean to be a
[44:20] champion I don't want this to be mind
[44:23] over matter but I want to I want you to
[44:25] look at it from the eyes of a holy ghost
[44:27] filed believer tonight cuz we received
[44:29] his Spirit how many of you got the
[44:31] spirit of God you got the token on
[44:33] display tonight just wave your token
[44:35] before him in prayer notice so what does
[44:37] it mean to be a champion Jack Dempsey he
[44:40] was a legendary boxer once said a
[44:42] champion is someone who gets up when he
[44:47] can't someone who gets up when he can't
[44:52] I'm looking at a whole lot of Champions
[44:54] in the room tonight cuz some of you
[44:56] didn't want to be here but you're here
[44:58] some of you got knocked down but you got
[45:00] back up some of you the devil says I'm
[45:03] going to take them out but you're here
[45:04] tonight that's proof that there's a
[45:06] champion on the inside there some of you
[45:09] have taken major blows and major
[45:11] struggles but yet you're still here
[45:13] pressing the
[45:16] battle so being a champion is knowing
[45:18] what your limits are and pushing past
[45:23] them man I I can tell you that takes a
[45:25] holy field believer to recognize your
[45:27] limitations and then push Beyond
[45:30] them there was a man by the name of
[45:32] Louis amorini brother Aaron and I are
[45:34] very familiar with this man not because
[45:35] we ever met him but because we are
[45:37] historians we like to read about World
[45:38] War II this was an Olympic champion this
[45:41] man at 18 years old Ran the 1930 uh 1936
[45:45] Berlin games and he met Adolf Hitler but
[45:48] after the the uh he ran the fastest mile
[45:51] if I'm not mistaken at that time the
[45:53] last lap so he ran the fastest lap in
[45:57] Olympian history at that time on the
[45:59] fourth lap but he got sent to the war
[46:01] and his plane was down he FL he flew a
[46:04] B24 and his plane was down and he he he
[46:07] drifted 47 days Out on the
[46:11] Ocean eating birds that would land they
[46:13] would take them and they would eat them
[46:15] and then rainwater catching them from
[46:16] the sky him and two other guys and then
[46:19] when he finally was rescued by the
[46:20] Japanese he suffered disease exposure
[46:23] starvation nearly daily beatings from
[46:25] guards and he was sent to one camp and
[46:28] there was a prison guard by the name of
[46:30] bird the bird they called him the bird
[46:32] and he took particular Glee in torching
[46:34] this Runner and one point he told him he
[46:39] had him hold a a large wooden beam
[46:42] across his shoulders and he threatened
[46:44] him he says if you drop it I'll kill
[46:47] you this is recognizing your limitations
[46:50] but your life was on the line and he
[46:52] realized no matter what he did he had to
[46:55] remain St de fast he had to push past
[46:57] his weaknesses he had to push past how
[47:00] he felt and he had to push past the
[47:02] resistance he had to push past the pain
[47:04] and that they said miraculously he held
[47:07] that beam over his head for 37
[47:12] minutes until finally the bird finally
[47:15] hit him and beat him and knocked them
[47:17] unconscious so being a champion is
[47:20] recognizing your limits but you got to
[47:22] be willing to press
[47:24] on recognizing your trial that that
[47:27] trial didn't come from God but is sent
[47:29] to to Spur You On To Be A
[47:33] Champion see a champion means to be to
[47:36] Bear unyielding courage which creates
[47:39] confidence many of us are familiar with
[47:41] John Wayne being that I was just out in
[47:43] the west man it just reminded me I saw
[47:45] John Wayne everywhere I
[47:46] went every man had a belt buckle and a
[47:49] cow boy had I'm like man this is John
[47:51] Wayne Heaven out here but John Wayne
[47:54] made the statement couraging is being
[47:56] scared to death but saddling up
[47:59] anyway and that's what God is looking
[48:01] for he didn't say it was going to be a
[48:03] flower better EAS and Leo DEA but he
[48:05] said you got to have courage I'm looking
[48:07] for Champions I'm looking for people you
[48:09] may be scared to death but you get in
[48:12] and you get on with it anyway because
[48:14] why because you're not living by your
[48:16] spirit you're living by his spirit and
[48:18] he sent forth the great Champion the
[48:20] champion of love to come and live inside
[48:23] of you to Spur you on to Good Works
[48:27] notice being a champion is not giving
[48:29] into your fears but recognizing your
[48:31] fears and moving
[48:34] forward how many of you have fears here
[48:38] tonight we all have some sort of fear
[48:40] that's just human nature but it's
[48:42] recognizing them and then moving past
[48:44] them moving forward not letting your
[48:47] fears hinder your
[48:49] faith notice it means to develop the
[48:52] habit of recognizing and responding to
[48:55] any any shred of
[48:57] positivity you know there's so much
[48:59] negative in the world today and it's so
[49:02] easy our human nature just grabs hold to
[49:04] the negative but notice we find there's
[49:07] Wars there's rumors of wars there's uh
[49:10] there's Russia and what Russia's doing
[49:12] there's political chaos there's social
[49:14] economic struggles there's crime there's
[49:17] people coming across the border in
[49:18] massive numbers and yet but being a
[49:21] champion is not focused on all these
[49:23] negative things but it's focused in on
[49:26] one
[49:27] thing it's Focus focusing on that which
[49:30] is positive and building upon that and
[49:34] remaining upon that it's harnessing your
[49:36] skills and talents and putting them to
[49:38] the work for the
[49:40] Lord being a champion it means calling
[49:42] those things that are not as though they
[49:47] are so what does it mean brother Joe to
[49:49] be a champion of a Believer what is what
[49:51] are we to look for so being a champion
[49:53] doesn't mean that you'll always be in
[49:55] perect perfect health that's right all
[49:58] right but being a champion means you're
[49:59] going to believe for it being a champion
[50:02] means you going to put that well body in
[50:03] front of you and you're going to take
[50:05] step day after day after day you're
[50:08] going to walk toward that body until
[50:10] finally that body obeys your confession
[50:13] and you're living and you're manifesting
[50:15] in a well body you don't give up just
[50:17] because you got a bad doctor's report
[50:19] you come back to the word of God back to
[50:22] your absolute back to your toost and
[50:25] this is what the word of God Says by his
[50:27] stripes I am healed today and a champion
[50:29] doesn't look at the doctor's report it
[50:31] doesn't look at his Affliction it looks
[50:33] to the Word of Promise and said I'm
[50:35] going to believe only
[50:38] that no being a champion means that
[50:41] doesn't mean that you'll always be in
[50:43] wealth that you'll never be in need of w
[50:45] but it means that you trust him to
[50:47] supply your every
[50:49] need David would tell us I have not seen
[50:52] the righteous
[50:53] forsaken nor his seed begging
[50:56] bread you may not know where that next
[50:58] meal's coming from but he
[51:00] knows you may not know how that bill is
[51:03] going to get paid but he
[51:06] knows and what he's trying to tell you
[51:08] tonight is you're not focused on all
[51:10] you're not caught up and apprehensive
[51:13] about that you're
[51:14] trusting you're trusting that he's going
[51:16] to make a way when there seems to be no
[51:19] way notice being a champion doesn't mean
[51:22] everything will always go your way all
[51:24] right new
[51:26] flash I know some of y'all are
[51:28] immediately disappointed right you mean
[51:30] really no it doesn't mean that you'll
[51:32] always feel him near it doesn't mean
[51:35] you're going to come to every service
[51:37] and it's going to be a spectacular
[51:39] meeting but it means that you come and
[51:41] because you believe that where two or
[51:43] three are gathered in his name he's
[51:45] promised to be there you may not feel
[51:47] him you may not see him but he's there
[51:49] nevertheless cuz he said I'll never
[51:51] leave you nor will I forsake
[51:54] you so we put our faith in the word of
[51:57] God not in our feelings not in what we
[52:00] see not in what we taste not in what we
[52:02] hear not in how we feel our faith
[52:05] anchors in the Rock of Ages tonight and
[52:07] we look past everything that we see
[52:09] taste smell and
[52:10] fear it's in him and him alone so many
[52:14] times
[52:16] Champions if you do any kind of study in
[52:19] athletics and things like that many
[52:20] times Champions are isolated people
[52:24] they're not the mass there there are the
[52:28] few see but you know in your harder
[52:31] hearts that he's going to never leave
[52:33] you as a young
[52:35] person you know in your heart of hearts
[52:37] in that deepest struggle in that great
[52:39] trial of Affliction he's there no matter
[52:43] what he is there because you have a word
[52:45] that declares he's there because you
[52:47] have a champion on the inside that
[52:49] declares he's there because the Holy
[52:51] Ghost is declaring that he's
[52:54] there so being a champion means that you
[52:57] push past to hardships and you keep your
[53:00] eyes fixed on the
[53:02] prize some of you got children here that
[53:05] are waver
[53:07] tonight to be a champion parent you're
[53:10] not picking out their flaws that new
[53:12] tattoo that they got or that new bobbed
[53:13] hair or whatever else it may be you're
[53:15] not looking at the you know the new
[53:17] boyfriend or the new girlfriend or
[53:19] whatever it may be you're looking at the
[53:21] Word of Promise said I got a promise for
[53:24] my prodal
[53:26] and I think about that prodical you know
[53:28] brother Brandon when he preached a
[53:29] prodical message he only preached it one
[53:30] time and he said the angel of the Lord
[53:32] came there and and tapped that young boy
[53:34] and said it's time to get up you've been
[53:36] here long enough that's right why
[53:39] because there was a dad there was a
[53:40] mother back home praying they didn't
[53:42] know where he went they didn't know how
[53:44] far he's gone but they were praying
[53:45] nevertheless they weren worried about
[53:47] the reports that they heard some need to
[53:49] turn your eyes away from the report and
[53:51] start turn believe in God's report
[53:53] tonight and he said that they and their
[53:56] offspring shall be there and be a
[53:58] champion of a parent tonight be a
[54:00] champion of Faith tonight believe it
[54:02] when nobody will believe with you trust
[54:04] him when nobody will trust with you I'm
[54:06] going to have my son I'm going to have
[54:08] my daughter I'm going to have my wife
[54:10] I'm going to have my husband I'm going
[54:12] to have one because the word says it I'm
[54:14] going to be a champion and I want you to
[54:16] know tonight the champion is already
[54:19] there he's already on the
[54:22] inside and he's wanting you to believe
[54:24] for it tonight
[54:28] Paul will tell us in Philippians 3 and:
[54:31] 13 so you got to keep your eyes on the
[54:34] prize he was Brethren I count not myself
[54:38] to have
[54:39] apprehended but this one
[54:42] thing I wish you could see this the way
[54:44] I got it highlighted in my my
[54:46] iPad Paul ain't looking at all the other
[54:49] things he's got his mind focused on one
[54:52] thing tonight notice what he says this
[54:55] one thing forgetting those things which
[54:57] are behind oh bless God some of you need
[55:00] to grab that right there and take hold
[55:02] of
[55:03] it grab ho quit looking at your failures
[55:06] quit looking at your mistakes quit
[55:08] looking at your defeats quit looking at
[55:10] all that quit looking at the things that
[55:11] are behind you and look to what look to
[55:14] the future look to the promise
[55:17] tonight he says forgetting those things
[55:20] that which are behind reaching
[55:23] forth unto the things that which are
[55:26] before oh I love that yes sir notice
[55:30] this one thing Paul had one great aim
[55:33] one purpose in life he didn't attempt to
[55:36] mingle the world in religion and the
[55:37] game both no he was
[55:40] single-minded he didn't seek to attain
[55:42] wealth and salvation too he didn't seek
[55:45] to retain honor here and the Crown of
[55:48] Glory Hereafter he had one object one
[55:50] aim one great purpose of his soul and
[55:53] I'm talking of more champ iions tonight
[55:55] you ain't worried about how high you can
[55:57] reach in that career or what you can be
[55:59] on the job some of you may be called to
[56:01] walk away from it to be a champion of
[56:04] Faith tonight but I want you to know you
[56:06] got one aim you got one purpose tonight
[56:08] and that's to make a Rapture that's to
[56:10] change this Dimension and step into a
[56:12] Heavenly
[56:14] [Applause]
[56:15] Dimension and Paul would tell us
[56:17] forgetting those things that which are
[56:20] behind you know he wasn't looking over
[56:22] his shoulder looking at how far he's
[56:25] come and who's running behind him or
[56:27] who's lingered who fell away no he kept
[56:30] his eyes
[56:32] steadfast keep your eyes looking forward
[56:34] Church don't be looking at what this
[56:36] church is doing and what that church is
[56:37] doing and what that sister's doing and
[56:39] what that brother's doing keep your eyes
[56:40] looking
[56:41] forward notice his attention wasn't
[56:44] diverted from this one and that one and
[56:46] everything else no but his attention was
[56:49] looking onward to the
[56:51] prize see he fixed his eyes intently on
[56:55] the
[56:56] goal he would tell us in verse 14 I
[57:01] press that word press there means to
[57:03] pursue in a hostile
[57:05] manner you know not everybody here
[57:07] tonight is going to be a Joe Adams you
[57:10] may not be a Tim pro excuse me brother
[57:12] Tim but we have strong constitution of
[57:14] faith not everybody's going to have that
[57:16] some of you going to have a different
[57:18] disposition and a different demeanor but
[57:20] yet Paul is telling us I press so no
[57:22] matter what your outcome no matter what
[57:24] your nature you can press tonight you
[57:27] can press with a hostile manner knowing
[57:29] that you're seeking eagerly for and
[57:31] earnestly endeavoring to acquire to
[57:33] acquire what brother the mark the goal
[57:36] of what the prize which is the reward oh
[57:39] church tonight the prize of a Believer
[57:41] is not this world but it's a Rapture
[57:44] it's a body change it's a marriage
[57:46] supper it's an eternal rain I'm pressing
[57:48] tonight I'm pressing with eagerness with
[57:51] determination to the mark the goal of
[57:54] the pr of having a body
[57:56] change that's what I'm pressing to I'm
[57:59] not getting caught up in all the the
[58:01] things of the world and and family
[58:03] struggles and strains and whatever else
[58:04] I press it toward the Mark I got one aim
[58:08] one goal I got to make a
[58:11] Rapture I got to make a
[58:14] Rapture he's pressing toward the high
[58:17] call and notice a life of honor and
[58:20] Glory the High Calling to a crown that's
[58:24] bright
[58:25] and
[58:26] imperishable the High Calling
[58:30] High not down and you've already been
[58:33] seen in a vision going up not down in
[58:38] defeat what is he saying oh Church you
[58:41] can't
[58:42] lose you're a
[58:45] champion so being a
[58:48] champion being a champion takes focus
[58:50] and
[58:51] determination as a young boy being a
[58:53] champion means you may have to go at it
[58:57] alone think about brother Andrew GL
[58:59] brother Andrew tner when he was a young
[59:01] boy growing up in this church and theu
[59:04] the influence that he was in but in a
[59:06] youth
[59:07] service in an unexpected
[59:11] place at an unexpected
[59:14] time somebody was casting a net at the
[59:17] young man behind him and he got all
[59:19] caught up in
[59:21] it and he still caught up in it
[59:25] I said that's the best catch Joe Adams
[59:27] has ever made what a blessing to the
[59:30] evening light Tabernacle that he has
[59:32] been to our
[59:33] church but yet he had to make a
[59:36] determination do I continue to go with
[59:39] my friends do I continue to drift off
[59:41] and skateboard and smoke and drink and
[59:43] do all that or do I finally surrender
[59:45] and be what God's called me to be and
[59:48] you see him here now he's married with a
[59:50] young baby and he's a great musician a
[59:52] great blessing to our church why because
[59:54] he made a decision that I'm going to be
[59:56] a champion a champion of the faith a
[59:59] champion for young people that God can
[1:00:01] and God will and God will do it again
[1:00:04] church he can do it tonight for you if
[1:00:06] you'll just believe and let go and let
[1:00:08] God have his
[1:00:10] way you don't have to keep walking down
[1:00:13] that lonely road to defeat no God has
[1:00:15] already seen you rising to victory
[1:00:18] [Applause]
[1:00:20] tonight notice so being a champion takes
[1:00:23] hard work
[1:00:25] takes
[1:00:26] dedication
[1:00:28] perseverance makes means you got to make
[1:00:31] sacrifices that right brother Andrew got
[1:00:34] to make some sacrifices but you find out
[1:00:36] they really wasn't sacrifices at
[1:00:39] all not at
[1:00:41] all so how many of you have ever played
[1:00:44] Sports and I know there's not going to
[1:00:46] be many hands
[1:00:47] here praise
[1:00:50] God but when I was in high school junior
[1:00:53] high I played Sports I I love football I
[1:00:56] took all my anger and aggression out out
[1:00:57] there on the
[1:00:58] field I was I was little fat and the guy
[1:01:01] next to me was big fat how about that
[1:01:03] for a
[1:01:05] nickname little fat and big fat I was
[1:01:08] 220 5 foot 6 he was 6'4 320 lbs we knew
[1:01:14] what it meant to open up a hole but I
[1:01:16] had a hunger I want to make it to the
[1:01:19] professional level you ain't never seen
[1:01:20] a 5 foot6 Pro
[1:01:23] lineman
[1:01:25] you may have seen a running back but you
[1:01:27] ain't never seen no Pro lman 5'6
[1:01:29] 220 I get manhandled out
[1:01:32] there so you just think they said I I
[1:01:35] drew some stats up and it t a little
[1:01:37] research and it says becoming a
[1:01:39] professional athlete it certainly ain't
[1:01:41] easy the chances of a going pro aren't
[1:01:44] in your
[1:01:46] favor I don't want to bust no bubbles
[1:01:48] tonight but the 1% of the top 1% achieve
[1:01:51] it that's not big numbers there are one
[1:01:55] 1,932 34 High School football players in
[1:01:59] in the United States and of that 1
[1:02:02] million
[1:02:03] 93,9 34 only 71,000 make it to College
[1:02:08] you do the math those are not big
[1:02:12] numbers now let's said take for instance
[1:02:16] the DAR ball from college to the pros is
[1:02:19] even more dramatic only 1.2% of college
[1:02:22] level players will get drafted in the
[1:02:25] NFL so up the 1,
[1:02:28] 93,7 34 High School football players
[1:02:32] only
[1:02:33] 853 players
[1:02:38] .75 make it to the pros each
[1:02:41] year being a champion is not for
[1:02:45] everybody but it's for you
[1:02:48] tonight but it's for you
[1:02:50] tonight see it's only for those that are
[1:02:53] willing to push past their limits it's
[1:02:55] for those that's willing to push past
[1:02:58] complexes push past family strength it's
[1:03:01] only for those that are willing to break
[1:03:05] Cycles cycle Breakers in the house of
[1:03:08] God tonight those that refuse to let the
[1:03:10] legacy of the feet continue to dictate
[1:03:13] their
[1:03:15] life think about that
[1:03:18] Champions well this one said you're
[1:03:20] never going to amount to nothing this
[1:03:21] one said you're never going to be are
[1:03:22] you better than us you no I'm better
[1:03:24] than that come on I ain't saying I'm
[1:03:27] better than you but I'm better than that
[1:03:29] I'm better than going down in De feat
[1:03:30] I'm better than drugs I'm better than
[1:03:32] alcohol I'm better than pornography I'm
[1:03:35] better than deceit I'm better than just
[1:03:36] being a denominational Christian I'm
[1:03:39] better than that why because I'm a
[1:03:42] champion and I got Champion pedigree all
[1:03:44] on the inside not by my doing but by his
[1:03:47] doing
[1:03:50] Church somebody's got to make that
[1:03:52] determination we're going not going to
[1:03:54] live like that anymore we're going to
[1:03:56] break the cycles and be better than
[1:03:59] [Applause]
[1:04:04] that you got to work harder you got to
[1:04:06] make more sacrifices why because
[1:04:09] somebody is there to Dethrone you Satan
[1:04:12] is determined to defeat you to destroy
[1:04:16] you you know but to be a champion means
[1:04:19] you got to be strong now I'm not talking
[1:04:21] about
[1:04:23] Johnny brother Johnny
[1:04:26] strong good Lord I wish I look like that
[1:04:28] when I get his
[1:04:31] age big old
[1:04:33] muscles big old traps oh man I never had
[1:04:37] traps probably CU they' be a
[1:04:41] trap but not big muscles but strong in
[1:04:44] the
[1:04:46] faith notice it reminds me of a
[1:04:50] character in The Bible my my my time's
[1:04:53] getting away but notice Romans 4
[1:04:55] 4:18 talking about Abraham he was a
[1:04:58] champion Abraham was considered the
[1:05:00] father of our faith and yet against hope
[1:05:02] he believed in hope that he might become
[1:05:05] the father of many nations according to
[1:05:08] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[1:05:12] be and being not weak in faith he
[1:05:16] considered not his own body now dead
[1:05:18] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:05:19] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:05:23] in one place I just listening to
[1:05:24] yesterday Abraham's Grace Covenant
[1:05:26] brother Brown say she was Barren and he
[1:05:28] was
[1:05:30] sterile and he looked past the barren
[1:05:32] womb he looked past the condition he
[1:05:35] looked past her her barness and he
[1:05:37] looked past his own sterilization and he
[1:05:40] looked at the word of God and he called
[1:05:43] those things that were not as though
[1:05:44] they were Church notice the Bible says
[1:05:47] he stagger not at the promise of God
[1:05:49] through unbelief but he was strong in
[1:05:52] the faith giving Glory glory to God and
[1:05:55] being fully persuaded that what he had
[1:05:58] promised he was able to
[1:06:01] perform so the word stagger
[1:06:05] there means to withdraw
[1:06:07] from so Abraham didn't withdraw from
[1:06:10] believing the promise after the first
[1:06:12] year when he didn't see anything he
[1:06:15] didn't withdraw the fifth year when he
[1:06:16] didn't see anything he didn't withdraw
[1:06:18] from the from believing the 10th year or
[1:06:20] the 15th year or the 20th year or the
[1:06:23] 25th year here he believed despite what
[1:06:26] he didn't
[1:06:27] see and the Bible says he was strong he
[1:06:30] was bold he was determined to stay with
[1:06:33] the promise because he was persuaded
[1:06:36] notice church he was fully persuaded
[1:06:39] it's one thing brother Aaron to be
[1:06:41] persuaded but it's an absolutely another
[1:06:43] thing to be fully persuaded you know you
[1:06:46] know beyond the shadow of a doubt that
[1:06:48] God is going to manifest that promise it
[1:06:50] may be one year 2 year 25 years but he
[1:06:54] who made the promise is more than able
[1:06:56] to bring it to
[1:06:58] pass right Abraham was more than just
[1:07:02] persuaded he was fully persuaded and
[1:07:05] being a champion of the faith he didn't
[1:07:07] withdraw from the
[1:07:09] promise I'm trying to show you tonight
[1:07:12] don't pull back from the promise of God
[1:07:14] God made you a promise God's given you a
[1:07:16] promise don't you pull back from it
[1:07:18] because what you see or what you don't
[1:07:19] see you keep believing keep trusting God
[1:07:22] will bring it to pass
[1:07:24] being a champion is being bold in the
[1:07:27] face of
[1:07:29] opposition notice it's remaining
[1:07:32] steadfast in the midst of your
[1:07:35] critics boy we sure got enough
[1:07:38] critics but we ain't backing down we
[1:07:41] ain't backing up and we ain't retreating
[1:07:44] and we ain't
[1:07:45] surrendering we moving
[1:07:47] forward we got a job to do we got a
[1:07:50] purpose we got a goal and it's a Rapture
[1:07:53] and it's it's that man's job that man's
[1:07:55] job that man's job my job to get all of
[1:07:57] y'all ready for
[1:07:58] it and as long as we're behind this
[1:08:00] Pulpit we're going to preach you into a
[1:08:02] Rapture because we're going to preach
[1:08:03] you Faith we're going to feed you the
[1:08:05] gospel we're going to feed you the word
[1:08:06] of God we're going to preach you a
[1:08:08] balanced
[1:08:09] diet oh we're going to preach you that
[1:08:11] you can have emotion when when it's all
[1:08:13] about him and he comes down and you get
[1:08:15] to Victory you got a reason to get
[1:08:18] emotional but we're going to Anchor it
[1:08:20] on the word of God we're going to have a
[1:08:22] foundation and that Foundation is sure
[1:08:24] and steadfast tonight it ain't just all
[1:08:26] emotion but we got a word to go with it
[1:08:29] we got an anchor of T that can't be
[1:08:31] moved
[1:08:33] tonight we got a sure Foundation we're
[1:08:36] anchored on the Rock of Ages light we
[1:08:39] may not understand
[1:08:42] everything but in God's time in God's
[1:08:44] season God will bring forth the
[1:08:46] Revelation I've been a witness I've been
[1:08:48] preaching 24 years now been a part of
[1:08:50] this church 25 26 years I didn't come in
[1:08:52] with all the head knowledge and all the
[1:08:54] understanding and even today I still
[1:08:55] have questions but I recognize that God
[1:08:57] brings the understanding in his time in
[1:09:01] his season well you shouldn't be
[1:09:03] preaching if you don't have all the
[1:09:04] understanding well you shouldn't be
[1:09:05] sitting there
[1:09:09] either uhuh a pot calling the kettle
[1:09:11] black we learn and we grow in our
[1:09:15] understanding we grow in our Revelation
[1:09:18] your Prophet
[1:09:20] did if he he did can't we
[1:09:24] some of you ain't sitting in the same
[1:09:25] mindset you sat 20 years ago at least I
[1:09:28] hope not no there should be a
[1:09:31] progression notice you know what a
[1:09:33] champion does a champion doesn't reflect
[1:09:35] or a champion doesn't dwell on defeat or
[1:09:38] what's in the past a champion reflects
[1:09:40] on where he was and thanks him for where
[1:09:41] he's at today because he knows all the
[1:09:43] work all the effort everything he's put
[1:09:45] into it every sacrifice he used to be
[1:09:48] there but today he's here he used to be
[1:09:50] in drugs but today he's in the house of
[1:09:52] God he used to be drunk but today he's
[1:09:54] filled with the Holy Ghost that's a
[1:09:56] champion he ain't looking at past the
[1:09:59] feet ain't going back around that circle
[1:10:01] around that mountain time and again no
[1:10:03] he's looking to the mark of the High
[1:10:05] Calling he's looking to the word of
[1:10:11] God he's believing for the
[1:10:15] promise when nobody when no one else
[1:10:18] brother Johnny will believe with him
[1:10:20] he's still
[1:10:22] believing when he has to walk alone he's
[1:10:25] still
[1:10:27] walking when he has to come to church by
[1:10:29] himself or by herself that's right she's
[1:10:32] still coming right when the kids have to
[1:10:36] come without the parents they're still
[1:10:39] coming Champion pedigree Champion
[1:10:44] pedigree oh I hope you're getting
[1:10:47] this notice a champion is not knowing
[1:10:51] the word defeat or retreat
[1:10:57] brother BR makes a statement in
[1:10:59] conferences never does God ever say
[1:11:03] Retreat that's
[1:11:04] right no retrea in God God is go
[1:11:10] forward some of you need to hear that
[1:11:12] one more time so I'm going to tell you
[1:11:15] God doesn't know the word
[1:11:18] Retreat God only knows the word go
[1:11:22] forward some many to stop going around
[1:11:24] that camp cop stop going around that
[1:11:26] mountain of depression that you've been
[1:11:28] in or fear that you've been in or
[1:11:30] complexes that you've been in or family
[1:11:32] strains that you've been in quit going
[1:11:34] around that thing circling around and
[1:11:36] wishing you could do better let me tell
[1:11:37] you you got to go forward now this is
[1:11:40] the time to press to the mark of the
[1:11:42] High
[1:11:45] Calling Moses at the Red Sea you don't
[1:11:47] think God knew that he was bringing him
[1:11:49] there he didn't get concerned about the
[1:11:52] Red Sea he was a concerned about the
[1:11:54] Egyptians that was on their Trail he
[1:11:56] wasn't worried about the mountains on
[1:11:57] both Sid God had already drew the
[1:11:59] blueprint he knew the path that they
[1:12:01] would
[1:12:02] take and when Moses came to God crying
[1:12:05] about it so like some of us crying about
[1:12:07] our trial crying about this and crying
[1:12:09] about that God didn't say okay Moses go
[1:12:11] back to Egypt no he says why cry to me
[1:12:14] speak and go forward his son is time for
[1:12:17] some of us to speak to the mountain
[1:12:19] that's in your way and move forward
[1:12:20] about
[1:12:22] it
[1:12:26] God is asking us to
[1:12:28] believe he's asking if I can take you
[1:12:32] out if I'm big enough to take you out of
[1:12:36] Egypt can't you trust me to take me take
[1:12:39] you into the promised
[1:12:40] land if I can take you from nothing if I
[1:12:44] can take you from drugs if I can take
[1:12:46] you from prostitution if I can take you
[1:12:48] from a party animal if I can take you
[1:12:50] from those things can't I take you to a
[1:12:52] rapture
[1:12:54] can't I take you to a Promised
[1:12:56] Land we ain't got to figure out all the
[1:12:59] mechanics of the sea splitting and water
[1:13:01] rolling back no all we got to do is
[1:13:03] trust
[1:13:04] God and go
[1:13:07] forward come on
[1:13:09] Champions see a
[1:13:11] champion notice now A Champion doesn't
[1:13:15] listen to all the other voices around
[1:13:17] them cuz there's so many voices in the
[1:13:20] world today but he's only focused on
[1:13:23] that one you remember the story brother
[1:13:26] Ram talked about the violin
[1:13:28] player he's playing that violin and when
[1:13:30] he got done everybody
[1:13:32] stood Standing Ovation that didn't move
[1:13:36] him right he wasn't looking for the
[1:13:39] standing ovation he wasn't looking at
[1:13:41] what everybody else talked he was only
[1:13:44] fixated on his trainer on his coach
[1:13:48] that's
[1:13:49] right and the Bible says my sheep hear
[1:13:52] my voice and a stranger they will not
[1:13:56] follow we're not here just seek all the
[1:13:59] Acclaim but he was only looking what
[1:14:01] does God think about it what does God
[1:14:03] think about my life what does God think
[1:14:05] about my decisions what does God think
[1:14:07] about my career what does God think
[1:14:09] about my church what does God think
[1:14:10] about my dress what does God think about
[1:14:12] my
[1:14:13] speech what does God think about it I'm
[1:14:16] not worried about what this family
[1:14:17] thinks about it cuz families have
[1:14:19] different degrees of standards in their
[1:14:21] families not every one of of us is going
[1:14:23] to carry the same standard in this
[1:14:25] church but what does God think about
[1:14:29] it Championship pedigree there's a
[1:14:32] champion within notice now let me go on
[1:14:35] just a little bit further tonight see a
[1:14:37] champion doesn't mean that you feed on
[1:14:40] complexes well I'm not good enough and
[1:14:43] you shouldn't be here and there's no use
[1:14:45] of trying anymore you know you might as
[1:14:47] well give up and quit no Champion don't
[1:14:50] listen to that
[1:14:52] garbage champ don't look at that
[1:14:55] Champions inside that message digging on
[1:14:57] 1100 something sermons reading that
[1:15:00] Bible praying seeking God's Direction
[1:15:02] that's What A Champion does he ain't
[1:15:04] feeding a complex he's feeding on thus
[1:15:06] sayith the Lord see being a champion
[1:15:09] doesn't mean you throw in a towel when
[1:15:10] the fight gets
[1:15:13] intense it's refusing to walk
[1:15:16] away it's refusing to quit but it's
[1:15:19] staying in the fight even if it means
[1:15:22] you take blows blow after blow after
[1:15:25] blow some of you wonder why can't we get
[1:15:28] ahead it's just another
[1:15:30] blow but the champion pedigree on the
[1:15:32] inside of
[1:15:33] he says I can take it I can take it I
[1:15:38] can take
[1:15:40] it and I'm gonna drop this in George
[1:15:43] Foreman Muhammad Ali George Foreman was
[1:15:46] The Undefeated Champion H Ali lost the
[1:15:48] belt seven years prior because he
[1:15:50] refused to go to war he was a champion
[1:15:52] in his mind but George Foreman was the
[1:15:54] great Champion he had a belt that proved
[1:15:56] it he had the hardest punch in boxing
[1:15:58] history and yet they met in the Manila
[1:16:00] or the the killa in the Manila I believe
[1:16:03] that was the name of oh no it was the
[1:16:04] Royal Rumble excuse me and here they
[1:16:07] were they're fighting and George Foreman
[1:16:09] comes out and Ali comes out bam he's
[1:16:11] floating like a butterfly bam stinging
[1:16:13] like a
[1:16:15] bee oh yeah all of a sudden couple
[1:16:18] punches from George Foreman he's laying
[1:16:20] against the ropes second round against
[1:16:22] the ropes third round he's against the
[1:16:23] ropes fourth round he's against the
[1:16:25] ropes fifth round he's against the ropes
[1:16:28] seventh round he's against the ropes the
[1:16:30] eighth round he's against the r and
[1:16:32] George Foreman is blow after blow after
[1:16:35] blow giving the best the hardest punches
[1:16:38] that he could and I he took it and he
[1:16:40] said it two times in that fight he was
[1:16:42] knocked out standing on his feet but he
[1:16:45] still stood there because he had
[1:16:47] Champion pedigree in his mind he had a
[1:16:49] champion pedigree in his heart and he
[1:16:52] stood there and he took the very best
[1:16:54] that George Foreman can do sh and then
[1:16:56] in the eighth round baby oh yeah he come
[1:16:59] out he come off the ropes and he began
[1:17:01] to swing B bam and a few swings like
[1:17:04] that and George Foreman was on the mat
[1:17:07] TKO knocked down first time in his
[1:17:10] career what am I telling you church I'm

[1:17:27] can dish out come off the road tonight
[1:17:31] it's time that you fight your way
[1:17:32] through
[1:17:35] this see a
[1:17:37] champion is mustering the strength to
[1:17:40] rise back up after getting knocked
[1:17:46] down brother Ram says I got a lot of
[1:17:49] respects for a man when he does when he
[1:17:52] does make make a mistake he's got
[1:17:53] courage enough to rise and try
[1:17:57] again oh my in this day and
[1:18:01] age that's few and far between but he
[1:18:04] says we're all going to make mistakes
[1:18:08] the best makes
[1:18:10] mistakes but a soldier is not one who
[1:18:13] will lay down when he's knocked down but
[1:18:15] he will rise up again he said we used to
[1:18:17] sing a song Let Me rise and try again
[1:18:20] who goes oh I like that for I have made
[1:18:22] many mistakes in my life we all have
[1:18:25] somebody needs to play that for voice of
[1:18:28] God we've all made many mistakes in our
[1:18:31] life but we've always been he goes I've
[1:18:34] always been thankful to God for Grace to
[1:18:36] let me rise and try again I believe the
[1:18:38] song is entitled forgive me Lord and try
[1:18:41] me one more time he goes I think that's
[1:18:43] it I'll be yours if you'll be mine if I
[1:18:45] fall if I sin Let Me rise and try
[1:18:48] again take me back and try me one more
[1:18:51] time see but a man man that's once
[1:18:53] knocked down if he's a real Soldier
[1:18:55] he'll rise up again Lord let me rise and
[1:18:58] try again but a
[1:19:00] coward as soon as he sees that he makes
[1:19:03] a mistake a little mistake first he goes
[1:19:05] just like this morning that bug and the
[1:19:07] water spider they will crawl right back
[1:19:09] to the water CU he can't stand it I'm
[1:19:12] talking to Champions
[1:19:14] tonight see Champions don't give up no
[1:19:18] matter no matter what your makeup no
[1:19:20] matter what your family treat no matter
[1:19:21] what your personality each of you
[1:19:24] possess Championship
[1:19:27] pedigree because he has given you him
[1:19:31] Spirit he has made you what you are the
[1:19:35] Bible says in Romans 8 and verse
[1:19:37] 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of
[1:19:40] this present time are not worthy to be
[1:19:42] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:19:45] revealed in us notice the glory this
[1:19:47] word here means magnificence or
[1:19:49] magnificance Excellence preeminence the
[1:19:53] most glorious condition the most exalted
[1:19:57] State and he says that the sufferings of
[1:20:00] this present time the financial
[1:20:02] struggles the sickness in your body the
[1:20:06] you know that season of of fall or That
[1:20:09] season of winter to where seems like
[1:20:11] everything's dead in your life and your
[1:20:12] experience is death he said for I reckon
[1:20:14] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:20:16] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:20:19] magnificence or magnificance which shall
[1:20:21] be revealed in US not to us but in
[1:20:25] us see it's the struggle that you go
[1:20:28] through that produces the
[1:20:32] champion the Affliction that you face
[1:20:35] cause this champion from within to come
[1:20:38] out and rise to the
[1:20:41] occasion brother B said before you can
[1:20:44] have Victory there has to be a battle if
[1:20:47] there are no battles then there no
[1:20:49] victories so we ought to be thankful for
[1:20:51] the battles and the tri
[1:20:53] it's God giv us an opportunity to have
[1:20:56] victories see but you got to have a
[1:20:58] battle to have Victory if it was just
[1:21:01] given to you it wouldn't it wouldn't be
[1:21:03] it wouldn't be a victory but he that
[1:21:05] overcometh is one who has the victory so
[1:21:08] Jesus came to the Earth he had a battle
[1:21:10] he won the Victory and tonight we have a
[1:21:12] battle with Christ and we have the
[1:21:16] victory you believe that
[1:21:18] church let me start bringing this down
[1:21:20] to a close
[1:21:25] you find me a stopping place
[1:21:27] here a few more
[1:21:34] minutes so we look at God tonight and in
[1:21:38] Exodus 15 and verse
[1:21:40] three the Bible says that the Lord is a
[1:21:43] man of
[1:21:45] war the Lord is his name that word man
[1:21:49] there man of war that phrase means he's
[1:21:51] a champion
[1:21:53] of
[1:21:55] War Champion never
[1:21:58] defeated he's defeated all rivals he's a
[1:22:02] great man a man of war and we find in 2
[1:22:05] Chronicles 20:1 17 you shall not fight
[1:22:07] in this battle set yourself stand still
[1:22:10] and see the salvation of the Lord then
[1:22:12] we find in Exodus 14:13 for the
[1:22:15] Egyptians whom you see today you shall
[1:22:17] see them again no more forever Exodus 14
[1:22:20] and ver14 the Lord shall fight for you
[1:22:22] and you shall hold your peace
[1:22:24] Deuteronomy 1:30 the Lord your God which
[1:22:27] goeth before you he shall fight for you
[1:22:31] he and then we've look in Deuteronomy 3
[1:22:32] and verse 22 you shall not fear them for
[1:22:35] the Lord your God he shall fight for you
[1:22:37] Deuteronomy 20 and verse four for the
[1:22:39] Lord your God is he that goeth with you
[1:22:42] to fight for you against your enemies to
[1:22:45] save you so the Lord is a man of war
[1:22:50] there's an attribute on the inside
[1:22:53] to
[1:22:54] fight I'm not saying you fight your
[1:22:56] neighbor I'm not saying you fight the
[1:22:58] church I'm not saying you fight one
[1:23:00] another but God has called us to fight
[1:23:03] the
[1:23:04] enemy you say well brother Joel I don't
[1:23:06] feel God near I don't you know sometimes
[1:23:08] God seems a million miles away he says
[1:23:11] can a woman forget her suckling child
[1:23:14] that she should not have compassion on
[1:23:15] her son of her womb yay they may forget
[1:23:17] yet I will not forget thee because why
[1:23:20] cuz I've I have Graven you upon the
[1:23:22] palms of my hand so when he threw his
[1:23:25] hands out and took your
[1:23:27] nails he engraved you on the palms of
[1:23:30] his hands he can no more forget about
[1:23:33] you so church tonight we got to press to
[1:23:37] battle yes sir there was a time that let
[1:23:42] me get to
[1:23:43] it there was a time that Theodore
[1:23:46] Roosevelt our former president after he
[1:23:49] was the president he went overseas and
[1:23:51] he did a tour and he was acting as an
[1:23:53] ambassador on behalf of the United
[1:23:55] States and he got over there and I
[1:23:57] believe he was in in in he was in Paris
[1:24:00] and he be he gave a speech that was
[1:24:02] called the citizenship in the
[1:24:05] Republic otherwise it became known as
[1:24:07] the man in the arena how many You' ever
[1:24:09] heard of
[1:24:11] that you know he he be to rail on the
[1:24:14] cynics who looked down at men who were
[1:24:16] trying to make the world a better place
[1:24:18] and he said the poorest way to face life
[1:24:20] is to face it with the
[1:24:23] near a cynical habit of a thought and
[1:24:27] speech a Readiness to criticize work
[1:24:29] which to critic himself never tries to
[1:24:32] perform have you ever met somebody like
[1:24:34] that they ain't never lifted a finger to
[1:24:36] help anything in the church help anybody
[1:24:39] do anything and yet they want to
[1:24:41] criticize they ain't never had nobody
[1:24:43] over to their house but they want to
[1:24:44] criticize because nobody has them over
[1:24:47] oh my oh brother Joe get off of
[1:24:51] that preach about the man in Arena I'm
[1:24:54] going back to
[1:24:56] it but notice they criticize never tries
[1:24:59] to perform an intellectual aloofness
[1:25:01] which will not accept contact with life
[1:25:04] realities all these are marks not of
[1:25:07] superiority but of weakness then he goes
[1:25:10] on here's the main theme of The Man in
[1:25:13] the arena it is not the critic who
[1:25:15] counts not the man who points out how
[1:25:18] the strong man stumbles or where the
[1:25:20] doer of Deeds could have done it better
[1:25:22] the credit belongs to the man who is
[1:25:24] actually in the
[1:25:26] arena the one notice because he says
[1:25:29] whose face is marred by dust and sweat
[1:25:32] and blood who strives valiantly who HS
[1:25:36] and who comes short time and
[1:25:39] again because there is no effort without
[1:25:41] error and shortcoming but who does
[1:25:44] actually strive to do the Deeds who
[1:25:46] knows with great enthusiasms great
[1:25:48] devotion who spins himself in a worthy
[1:25:51] cause who had best knows in the end the
[1:25:53] Triumph of high achievement and who at
[1:25:56] the worst if he fails at least he fails
[1:25:59] while daring
[1:26:00] greatly least he's putting forth effort
[1:26:04] at least he's fighting at least he's in
[1:26:07] the
[1:26:08] arena so that his place shall never be
[1:26:11] with those cold timid Souls who neither
[1:26:14] knew Victory nor
[1:26:18] defeat so today at this moment at this
[1:26:20] hour in this age in this
[1:26:22] service you are the man in the
[1:26:29] arena we look at Hebrews 11 musicians
[1:26:32] you can make your way back I'm not done
[1:26:33] preaching but I'm going to go a few more
[1:26:34] minutes but if you'd make your way back
[1:26:36] Hebrews 11 and: 33 we talk about this is
[1:26:39] The Heroes of Faith are the champions of
[1:26:42] Faith chapter and we look here and it
[1:26:44] says who through faith they subdued
[1:26:47] kingdoms they wrought righteousness
[1:26:49] 11:33 obtained promises stopped the
[1:26:52] miles of Lies quenched the violence of
[1:26:54] fire escaped the edge of the sword out
[1:26:56] of weakness were made strong waxed
[1:26:58] Valiant in in fight turned to flight the
[1:27:01] armies of the aliens women received
[1:27:04] their dead raise to life again and
[1:27:06] others were tortured not accepting
[1:27:08] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[1:27:10] better resurrection and others had trial
[1:27:12] of cruel mockings and scourgings yay
[1:27:15] moreover a bonds and imprisonment they
[1:27:17] were stoned they were sown aund were
[1:27:20] tempted were slain with a sword they
[1:27:22] wondered about in sheep skins and gohost
[1:27:24] skins being destitute Afflicted and
[1:27:26] tormented of whom this world is not
[1:27:29] worthy of they wandered in deserts and
[1:27:31] in mountains and in dens and in caves of
[1:27:33] the earth see all these
[1:27:36] Believers had their
[1:27:40] Arena Great Men great women stopped the
[1:27:42] mouths of lions quench the violence of
[1:27:44] fire escaped the edge of the sword they
[1:27:47] were made strong the weak were made
[1:27:49] strong all these were champions that's
[1:27:52] right of their
[1:27:55] day some were tortured They didn't
[1:27:57] accept Deliverance because they wanted
[1:27:59] to attain a better Resurrection others
[1:28:02] had trial of crew mockings and scourging
[1:28:04] and bonds of imprison they were stoned
[1:28:06] and swn US sun temped and slain they
[1:28:08] wondered about in sheep skins and gohost
[1:28:10] skins destitute Afflicted and tormented
[1:28:13] but we're not talking about their day
[1:28:15] and their Arena I'm talking about today
[1:28:18] it's not them that's in the arena it's
[1:28:20] you that's in the arena and the Bible
[1:28:22] tells us that they without us cannot be
[1:28:25] made perfect they are waiting for more
[1:28:28] Champions to
[1:28:30] come you may think well what have I done
[1:28:33] that's been so great man when we get to
[1:28:36] the other side I'm going to find one of
[1:28:37] these and I'm going to ask them how did
[1:28:39] you make it but you don't realize
[1:28:41] they're going to find you and say how
[1:28:43] did you make it how did you come out of
[1:28:46] Satan's Eden that's right I'm going to
[1:28:48] tell you how you made it cuz a champion
[1:28:51] on the inside
[1:28:53] a champion on the inside and the man
[1:28:56] didn't give you that champion the church
[1:28:58] didn't give you that champion but God
[1:29:00] came and gave you his son his holy
[1:29:03] spirit to Champion you through see their
[1:29:06] Arena produced some of the greatest
[1:29:07] Champions that history has ever
[1:29:10] chronicled and today it's not those in
[1:29:12] Hebrews 11 but it's
[1:29:15] us and some of your Affliction is
[1:29:17] financial some of your Affliction is
[1:29:19] your children it's your family it's your
[1:29:21] marriage it's your
[1:29:23] finances it's your body it's your
[1:29:25] sickness it's an
[1:29:28] arena it's not the critic who
[1:29:31] counts watching the services criticizing
[1:29:35] your rejoicing criticizing your
[1:29:39] emotion it's not the critic that counts
[1:29:42] it all matters to the man that's in the
[1:29:44] arena because he knows great stals he
[1:29:48] knows what he's been through to produce
[1:29:51] that emo motion to produce that
[1:29:53] overwhelming feeling of release when he
[1:29:56] finally gets the
[1:29:58] victory see the credit belongs to the
[1:30:01] man who's actually in the
[1:30:05] arena see the man who strives valiantly
[1:30:09] even when he's exhaust and weary he
[1:30:12] continues to
[1:30:14] fight think about the man who's been up
[1:30:17] all night
[1:30:20] puking because he's fighting
[1:30:25] cancer battling Caesars before he walks
[1:30:28] out behind the
[1:30:31] pulpit he don't come like this when a
[1:30:34] champion walks through the
[1:30:37] door and he comes and he
[1:30:40] smiles says I love
[1:30:43] you a champion of the
[1:30:46] faith when Satan Throne everything he
[1:30:49] could at
[1:30:50] him he stands behind this desk to preach
[1:30:53] to you a God that still heals a God that
[1:30:58] still
[1:30:58] delivers can I tell you about a few more
[1:31:00] Champions present
[1:31:02] day A Champion is a
[1:31:05] man who maybe lost a spouse or a loved
[1:31:08] one instead in getting down on
[1:31:13] it and digressing and pulling
[1:31:16] away a champion
[1:31:18] Rises and he walks out those doors but
[1:31:21] he's got a people that believes in him
[1:31:24] and he stands behind this and says don't
[1:31:26] have pity for me I know where she's
[1:31:29] at and he preaches to you a God that's
[1:31:32] still
