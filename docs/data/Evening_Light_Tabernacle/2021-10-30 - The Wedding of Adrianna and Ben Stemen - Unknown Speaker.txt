father our hearts rejoice today lord to see the two paths of ben and adriana come together like this father to christians to be joined in holy matrimony father we desire lord that you would have the highest place in this ceremony lord that your blessings will be upon it father as we remember lord when you is here on earth that your first miracle was performed at a wedding lord lord you rejoice in these things at your institution we ask you to have your way and bless every part of it now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen today we have a wedding of royalty the world may not recognize it as such but this wedding today brings together two families of royalty we have stepped out of eternity into a space of time we were pre-planned from the foundation of the world our names were written in the lamb's book of life and today one of the photos of the lamb's book of life is standing before us and heaven is given witness angels are present watching a scene unfold known only by god but expressed now in this moment eternity and time have blended together in celebration of this moment this is more than a beautiful moment in time as it was for ordained before the foundation of the world not only do we have this great assembled host today of friends and family but host of heaven itself has drawn near to witness this event for these attributes of god are now on display as this wedding itself is a reflecting the glory to come when god will take himself a bride a bride without spot or wrinkle even as the pruitt and steven families unite together today ben you and adriana were acquainted long before you fell in love then she was just another girl but there was a day when the arrow of love struck your heart and you just simply not been able to think of nothing else but her i believe this is a union that god has built adriana it was last christmas i spoke to you that life was about to change i foretold to you that it would happen suddenly when god would bring a man into your life and this so we know this union was for ordained and one that god has built it was pre-planned maybe we can't remember standing in eternity because it was just a thought then in god's mind but now we are in time doing what god foresaw and preak plan long ago in the eternal ages time has its ups and downs with both great joys and deep sorrows but god in his wisdom knew that man should not be alone and has destined for this part of of life's journey for you two to walk together hand in hand here in time as you head toward eternity and then although you may never proclaim the word of god from a pulpit or you either adriana but you both were ordained to carry out this word as a wife true to her husband and as a husband who emulates christ in all things and god has so designed it where you will not do this alone but together as one flesh so today is a reflection of what god did in the garden of eden as the scripture once again becomes god breathed to be fulfilled in you in the garden god created adam in his own image from spirit form to flesh form but god did not want man to be alone and i believe this is the heart of god for he too wants a bride in his image that together they will reign as king and queen in the eternal ages to come looking upon adam god's side man is alone and it's not good so he performed an operation and reached into his side and brought out a portion of man's own flesh what a wedding that was it was there under the canopy of the garden of eden and just as we saw it in your eyes ben as your eyes lit up as she walked down the aisle and all of a sudden these hundreds of guests just faded away as all you could see was her but suddenly in that moment the most important one walked into the room may that never leave your life then for your eyes must always remain single upon her and adriana your eyes must always remain single upon your husband so that you behold no other man but him you see ben the man is never complete until he's married and then after that he's finished and this union you're making is something that god desires to do himself god had placed that in adam to be lonely because he too desired a wife prophets foretold of this isaac and rebecca portrayed it we also read by bible accounts of the love of man and the woman of jacob's love for rachel and of mary pledged to joseph and that of the shulamite and her beloved but none of that could fully express god's great desire so that's why jesus left all the ivory palaces and its golden streets and all of heaven's glory to take upon himself the form of a man and to reflect his pleasure in weddings the first miracle he performed would be at a wedding where water was turned into wine he did this by the power of creation and with this power the same lord jesus is here today to take two people and by the same miraculous power turn two people into one the bible teaches us that god is love and love comes from god from the beginning to the end the bible is a love story then we read of god's love to his people the love that sent christ to the cross and of redeeming love for the sinner and the abiding love for the redeemed god is the author of your love and that love is not to be temporary do not treat it as temporary do not treat it as something that will just quickly fade away not one day is to be grand taken for granted for life is just simply too short you make christ a part of this marriage he wants to be the unseen guest in your home he wants to be in every conversation he's always near in good times and bad times and difficulties and financial troubles and choices of life and great decisions that will have to be made he's always there make sure you don't let one day go by where you don't spend time together and with the lord jesus christ then i think of you as a real man a prince a child of the most high god your family your pastor your church family they've done an incredible job of raising you and preparing you for this day your description of what this message is all about you are the message so may i wonder what is it you're it your description of all the incredible sermons and what they're all about your great compliment to your grandfather's ministry and all the wonderful sermons that both of your uncles and other men of god had poured into you adriana supernatural gifts came through your family you have a great heritage there's a handing down from one generation to another the seeds of greatness that was in your grandmother is in you besides that god has gifted you above many others to be anointed to sing and to bless others you are able with that gift to literally charge the atmosphere and even make demons run for cover but join together now your life will have more depth you will have greater understanding god has set you apart from others to be a shining example to the world of god's grace and his wonderful goodness brother branham spoke in the sermon the chosen of a bride and then there he expounded upon the truth of how a man will choose a woman that reflects his own character and then we really couldn't see the inside of you until now but wow i would say you're absolutely beautiful god is the author of love it is him that brings us together it is his love that will carry us through love conquers all it conquers every demon it conquers every power it is the greatest force on the face of the earth let nothing come between you if it does recognize it as the spirit of the enemy ah there be surely times of dis disagreements but settle every argument or disagreement on your knees and remember this powerful word and put it to use forgive love is based on forgiveness hold no grudges let it go in just love for love is of god ben will you have this woman to live together in the holy covenant of marriage will you love her honor her and comfort her and keep her in sickness and in health and forsaking all others be faithful to her as long as you both shall live and adriana but you have this man to live together in holy covenant of marriage where you love him honor him comfort and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all others be faithful to him as long as you both shall live marriage was instituted by god it's not simply an idea of man marriage is a gift of god it's given to comfort the sorrows of life and to celebrate its choice marriage is the classmen of hands the blending of hearts the uniting of two lives is one your marriage must stand not by the authority of the state not by the seal of your wedding certificate but rather it must stand by the strength of your love it must stand this in the devotion of your love to one another in the good times and the bad finally it must stand because of the participation of god in your relationship marriage is to be the greatest relationship you will ever experience however to keep that marriage with it will reach its full of potential you must allow god to play a primary role in your relationship he knows your thoughts he knows your needs he understands your heart and your love for each other in fact it was god that created the love and excitement you're experiencing at this moment the ideal marriage is like an eternal triangle with each of you at the bottom of the triangle and got at the top in that triangle and the closer you get to god the closer you become one to another certainly you want your new life to be perfect you have visions of eternity of joy but let me caution you it won't always be that way all the time unfortunately sorrow and heartache find their way into every life however if that eternal triangle remains unbroken no problem will be too great ben love adriana as your wife with all your being as christ loved the church and your wants and needs will always be met likewise adriana if you respect love and honor ben as your husband he will love and care for you all the days of your life finally let me say to the both of you remember the eternal triangle keep your spiritual eyes and ears open to god who is the source of love and fulfillment will be yours i promise you he will lead you into capacities that you never dreamed you possess this time michael we will have the song by adriana falls in life i prayed for you [Music] before i called you mine oh i can't believe it's true sometimes oh i can't believe it's true i get to love you it's
