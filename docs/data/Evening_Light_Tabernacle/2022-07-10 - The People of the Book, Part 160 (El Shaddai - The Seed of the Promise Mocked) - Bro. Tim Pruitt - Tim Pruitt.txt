that but we thank the lord for that and all of you that have donated to that made it possible we want to say thank you and also uh also then we will have our fellowship meal together and and then communion foot washing with more word tonight amen so we got a full day amen and what a wonderful time to be in god's presence be with god's people so take advantage of this make every moment count amen genesis chapter 21 and verse 1 and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken isn't it wonderful when god does what he says he will do you can always count on him for sarah conceived and bear abraham a son in his old age that's not saying nothing about her old age but it was that old age too this was a double miracle and at the set time of which god has spoken to him and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac meaning laughter god hath made me to rejoice and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old and as god commanded him and abraham was a hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that here will laugh with me and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck if i have borne him a son in his old age and as a child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which he had born unto abraham mocking wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bonds woman and her son for the son of this bondswoman will shall not be heir with my son even with isaac and the thing was very grievous in abraham's sight because of his son and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bonds woman but in all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and the bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast a child under one of the shrubs and she went and sat down over against him a good way off as it were a beau shot for she said let me not see the death of the child and and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and well and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar fear not god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is arise lift up the ladder hold him in thine hand for i will make him a great nation and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the water bottle with water and gave the lad drink amen god bless you can be seated we're going to be speaking on this morning of the the seed of the promise mocked so it's again about el shaddai and the visitation of the almighty and the events that surround it and i want you to remember this is a part of prophecy so just as much as the rest of it is prophecy you know that this also is prophetical and i i want you to note that this will exactly happen it will cause a separation in the body you see they were all one body all called one seed of abraham and a whole church of abraham believers but when isaac was born and then the seed of abraham which was isaac was mocked the promise was mocked then there came a separation now it wasn't just human separation god himself did the separating god came along and said listen to what sarah said because the this child will not be heir with the this child of the promise will not be heir with the child of the bombs woman so this is prophecy remember the message the rapture brother branham spends the first half of that speaking about the scorners and the scoffers that is all a part of the rapture hour so they must be here now so it's going to be your attitude toward the promise of god that will identify who you are now if you'll turn with me to romans 14 17 i'm just going to use this for a foundation here i want to divert for a moment read a couple more scriptures to give me uh some background for what i want to speak on but um i want you to see romans 4 17 tells us what the kingdom of god is and he said the kingdom of god is not meat and drink which is in that case was religious forms rules and regulations but righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost so the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost so let's just take it like this and we're going to say the kingdom of god is the holy ghost the kingdom of god is the holy ghost now i have a reason for going here before we go to my next scripture let's go to the bible and let's turn to the matthew chapter 22 and verse 2 and we're going to see the kingdom of heaven is the kingdom of god and it is righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost it is life in the holy ghost so when you see the kingdom of heaven or the kingdom of god in the bible it is describing life in the holy ghost all right now so this is this is now a parable that jesus gives and he says life in the holy ghost as the holy ghost reigns there's going to be something that happens it's going to be likened to a king which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them which forbidden and to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants and say and tell them which are bidden um behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen my fatherlands are killed and all the things are ready into the marriage remember el shaddai in our story there isaac was there was a feast made and there was an invitation given but now there's a mocking of the seed during the time of the feast jesus said in the kingdom of heaven are in the realm of the holy ghost when it is being poured out there's going to be a feast that is going to be prepared and there's going to be bidding to come to that feast but notice he says but they made light a bit they mocked it and went their way one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and threw them so there's a persecution but then when the king heard thereof he was wrought sent forth his armies destroyed those murders burned up their city and then he said to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy so go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so that those servants went out on the highways and gathered together as many as they found both good bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests god's going to have somebody amen it's a celebration feast and when the king came in to see his guests watch now he still sees further mockery he sees a man which had which there which had not owned a wedding garment you see he didn't take seriously what he was being invited to and he didn't prepare for the feast which again is mocking and he said unto him friend how come this thou hid her not having a wedding garment and he was speechless and then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him in the outer darkness and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen you see the the consequences was the same cast out the bonds woman she went into the wilderness where there was wailing and gnashing of teeth amen amen and cast out into outer darkness into the wilderness because of the attitude toward the feast now abraham and his and sarah had met the almighty god and to them a miracle was promised and god had had come to bring them strength to give them a faith to bring forth even though sarah was 99 years old and sarah was 90. remember this types are body change and it types the renewing of the body it types the renewing of the church the revival here in this last day that is promised to bring forth a bride who can reproduce christ and and so el shaddai is the type of the baptism of the holy ghost and we have been instructed to nurse our strength and refreshment from him amen because the holy ghost is the source that we get the renewing from that we get the change remember the change is not just going to happen in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that change starts from the inside out and so as as we look at this i want you to think um as brother branham it's so beautiful he said this and abraham and his seed after him he said i'm the breasted god i'm the strong one lean on my bosom now and nurse from me my strength and your weak body getting him ready for a miracle so now let's take the type again the holy ghost is given to get you ready for the miracle amen now that's what he done to the pentecostals after the western age now what miracle are we talking about it is the miracle of a new body it is a miracle of the promised son the coming of jesus christ the long-awaited son that we've been expecting now for 2 000 years now here he's offered here's what he offered the pentecostals he offered them the word in his fullness as right around 1906 the spirit of god began to be poured out upon the people in this age to bring an age to bring a people to the fullness of the word to the fullness of its power to where god could be displayed in full strength and he offered the pentecostals the word in his fullness unsealed totally unsealed totally revealed but but they chose instead speaking in tongues amen and tongues was given a place of more of more importance greater than the discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart which was the evidence of the word present amen and that's that was the same sign that jesus performed when the word was made flesh and and this too again was a mockery it was a making light of what god had sent in our generation and once again i want to say we have been offered god has offered us the word in its fullness the full land the complete inheritance and we don't have to limit ourselves to any one gift we don't have to limit ourselves to speaking in tongues or one gift like the pentecostals did we can have the whole land and god has offered us a full course menu because all the seven seals are open which opens the entire book to us but now watch what many have done with this you see right in the message community instead of having the experience of the fullness of the holy ghost too many have taken a secular denominational approach and like the baptist just say i believe the message amount of mental assent to agree unto a doctrine and deny the supernatural birth of the word and doing so reject christ and this is making a mockery of the true holy ghost when you take the holy ghost and just make it a mental uh a mental ascent or or a dried-eyed confession or just uh just an agreement that the word is true and you call that the holy ghost that is mocking the spirit of god it's making light of it now you see they're doing the same that mary did and mary you know of course confessed to the angel it came mary confessed that her child was born of um a supernatural birth she confessed all that but in the moment in a moment of weakness when she went looking for jesus who was there in the temple and standing before all those priests she denied the supernatural birth by saying your father and i have been looking for you and jesus the word corrected the era and he said don't you know i must be about my father's business jesus corrected my father isn't this man my father is god and i must be about his business amen so now again you see in that moment of weakness a good woman like mary because she hadn't received the holy ghost yet either but in that moment you know standing before those priests you know she didn't want to she didn't want to look like a you know an illegitimate birth or a fatherless son or you know or maybe in that moment she was a little bit awkward to say oh he was born in the supernatural so she said my father your father and i calling joseph his father and in that moment of weakness denied the supernatural birth and brother bradham said she denied the supernatural birth pentecost took speaking in tongues they denied the birth of the word you see that's exactly what they did it takes so much of it won't take the rest of it it denied the birth of the word just like mary did in other words they they accepted a man-made formula from a denomination rather than the word of god now like brother valdez said i quoted last week the azusa movement took a manufactured tongue of a make-up made-up language uh a doddy do you know a daddy daddy and denied the supernatural birth of the word manufactured and mocked made of mockery out of the true gift of god now again this is what sends them to the tribulation weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth now again brother branham in 64 question answers that what's the pentecostal age after he come to there he made the promise of el shaddai nurse from me the question is can you nurse that was brought before the pentecostals can you nurse but they didn't do it they grabbed them a breast from the nomination where they came out of but the real seed come on to nurse that breast i'm telling you there's a real seed hallelujah a real seed that's going to come and nurse from the breast of el salvia get a real true holy ghost not just an anointing an infilling now what's what he offered the pentecostal and now what what's what he offers us by the holy ghost i want you to get this he offered it to this last age and the pentecostals were the first to start to embrace it now and so he offered it to them but rather than that they went to denomination and nursed their strength of i spoke in tongues i shouted i danced and i spoke in tongues they took outward emotions and a manufactured tongue and exalted that over the promise of god making a mockery of it hold my thought now you see and as brother branham said you know i am the breasted god i am this strong one lean on my bosom now nurture me my strength into your weak body getting him ready for the miracle he let pentecostals nurse his own strength his own holy spirit as a baptism back into their weak bodies to give them faith for the rapture to give them faith for miracles now i want you to see what the holy ghost does that was offered to the pentecostals that they took the breast to denomination for what's now what will it do it will it will nurse strength back into their weak bodies give them faith for a rapture and give them faith for miracles this is what the holy ghost will do it will give you rapture and faith hallelujah amen the rapture and faith is not a tape raptured faith is the holy ghost it's what gives you it's what gives you rapture and faith amen so he said now what he what he did to abraham and seed after him believe in confirmation blood covenant now injecting himself his strength into his people look here you say brother to him how can we live in our overcoming life in this evil age because you can nurse from him and his strength comes into you by the baptism of the holy ghost that gives you power over a life of sin now so that's how we can stand in this age think of it think of it to bring us to rapture all we got to do is drink from the holy ghost amen which is also christ the word in its fullness with baptism after baptism of it giving us faith for miracles and faith for rapture amen hallelujah what i'm trying to tell you is everything you need is in the holy ghost you need healing that's in the holy ghost get another drink from it if you need deliverances in the holy ghost you need overcoming power it's in the holy ghost get a drink of it you can actually nurse his life into you now this was isaac he was born of god's life he wasn't born of abraham's strength he was born of the strength of el shaddai now in the in the message lord show us the father and it suffices us he said what do you have to do with the tree you take it free you plant it in the ground and then you have to water it and as you water it it doesn't do nothing but drink drink drink and it has to drink more than its portion and more it drinks the bigger it swells it pushes out limbs it pushes out leaves it pushes out blossom it pushes out apples and that's the way a christian is we're planted together in christ jesus who is an inexhaustible fountain of life and we are planted in christ and we just drink and drink and drink and push out and everything we need of the for the earthly journey divine healing the power of god all these things is in every individual that's received the baptism of the holy ghost for your planet in christ hallelujah the holy ghost baptism and everything you have need of for this life journey even the rapture is in you right then hallelujah amen we might be waiting on the final quicken into the rapture but i'll tell you you've got the holy ghost you've got a faith if there's only going to be one that make it out of this generation not that one god can no more deny me than deny himself because it's his own life in you brother brown said now don't resent that that's the truth the rapture is in us now i will prove it by the gospel those he called he justified and those he justified he hath glorified hallelujah then in heaven today we're glorified in the presence of god right now and i'm just pushing out to it amen glory clubs in his word you believe it all right so it's a refreshing now remember it's a feast and in the feasts there's refreshment and this feeling of the holy ghost is not merely an anointing or a baptism in the gifts but it's now god injecting himself his own strength into his people how by them nursing his own holy spirit as a baptism to give them faith for the rapture and faith for miracles now let's look in the bible and see what's promised in this end age go to acts chapter 3 verse 19. and he tells us to repent you therefore and be converted that your sins might be blotted out sins are blotted out without conversion and repentance when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord god's going to be pouring out his spirit in this last days and it's at times of refreshing i'm going to give a feast i'm going to give a feast of a seven course menu i'm gonna open in the entire book amen because we're celebrating that there is now a supernatural people on earth now again isaac was not born of the will of man or the will of the flesh but he was born of god look now and verse 20 and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you of whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things how many beliefs were in that time which god has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began in fact what we read today was being prophesied amen of the seed of abraham having a feast in this last day hallelujah celebrating that life is here celebrating that the joy is here that that here made us to laugh who would have thought after 2 000 years and all the trouble down to the ages that the oil church sarah would bring for the child who would plot there could be a rapture after all of this time when it's been given up on for years and years and years when people have lost faith but in this moment god has made us to laugh hallelujah we can look over and say denomination didn't do it isn't the man didn't do it almighty god did this this is not another child of the bones woman this is not another denomination rising up this is a supernatural child what's now coming back in his full strength what was the holy ghost given for but pentecost what is it it's a restoration of the same kind of grain that went into ground at the beginning bringing all the fullness of the power of pentecost by the baptism of the holy ghost in the last days you know what it is it's a people that the eagle anointing is on how many knows we're in the eagle age under an eagle anointing amen they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength so you see in the eagle age there comes a time of renewing of strength a time of repression a feast time a time of rejoicing god has made us to laugh amen turn with me to psalms 103 101 verse 103 verse 1 bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord on my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities and who healeth all of thy diseases hallelujah that's the benefits of belonging to abraham's seed amen who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercy who satisfieth thy mouth with good things we're having a feast in a time of great trouble he has hit us in his pavilion in his time of trouble he has led us into shady green pastures in the time of trouble are you with me church there's a refreshment a feast prepared i'll set a table before you in the presence of thine enemies when hell is all around you i'm going to be having a marriage feast a celebration hallelujah a celebration that life has now in the body which is the vindication the rapture is at hand all right so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles you see the bride's anointing is an eagle anointing and when the bride when it when when the old bird gets old and its beak gets crusty he can go back to the rock where he was born and beat against that rock and there he will molt and grow new feathers and there he'll knock the crust off of his beak i know that's true i mean my you know we we my dad always loved to have a bird in the house and see he always had a parakeet that could talk and he would train them to talk and and and he had one one of the parakeets got old and when he did there was a growth that came over his nose and that and it was closing off his air holes and and they so you know he he was getting more and more sick and my dad looked at him examined him recognized the problem and he took his old fingernail and got to working on that beak and he began to scrape off and pull the crust off of that old bird where he could breathe through his nose again well i'll tell you what unbelief in the world and doubt and fear and claims that days of miracles are past can make you so stuffy closing up your airways where you can't fly i tell you what it's time to go back to the rock hallelujah go back to pentecost go back to where we were born our birthplace and beat on that rock until the crust comes off and we believe that christ is the same again you see the coming of el shaddai to abraham and sarah was to bring about the renewing of their youth the infilling of the holy ghost is bringing about a renewing an old 2000 year old church who had long given up on the promised son is changing her back to the same new young bride that she was on the day of pentecost i want to hear i want you to get what i'm saying this drink that god is pouring out this holy ghost that he's given amen with this word that he has given comes the power of the word the holy ghost somebody help me preach and in doing so he is renewing the 2000 year old church to be like she was on the day of pentecost when she was a young girl that's what he did to sarah [Applause] he changed her back to young again you see satan knows it surely now i'm going to read some things just real quickly from the the church age book just to remind you of who we are satan knows assuredly that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 an action is the true church that jesus claims as his own all else is false amen so there has to be a renewing of the church that being likes it was on the day of pentecost don't you know there is a resistance to the truth do you know what that is it's the working of devils because satan knows assuredly that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 and actually is the true church the one that jesus claims as his own all else is faults so it's a workings the devil through impersonations of real gifts like tongues until something so wonderful and precious is speaking in a heavenly language is despised and rejected it's a mockery of the truth as isaac was mocked the supernatural should be celebrated hallelujah that's why god called the beast it's celebrating the supernatural who would have thought this would ever happen but it's happening who would ever thought the young people could get a real baptism of the holy ghost in this evil age but it's happening anyhow who would have ever thought there would still be signs and wonders and miracles among the church but it's happening anyhow it's an hour of celebration [Applause] you see the old vine is putting forth another branch the old woman was becoming new again the old church is having a revival [Applause] and when the the old vine puts forth another branch its branch is just like it was in pentecost because he said but if the mind ever puts forth another branch of itself that branch will be exactly like the vine itself it'll be the same kind of a branch that was brought forth at pentecost it will speak in tongues prophesy and have the power and signs of the resurrected christ in it amen amen again taking this these these series of quotations just to remind you of this renewing what god is doing taking sarah back to the way she was when she was young except this time we're predestinated not to fall he fixed the problem with the womb by procrastinating this one not to fall he not just turn her back like that it's not a repeat of pentecost in the sense that we're going to repeat their fall and they're falling away this was not going in the ground it's going in the garner that's what the church was at pentecost is the standard that's the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholar says the god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close many believes we're to be the true church then the true church will always try to be like the original pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first day in the ephesian church age he said it this way the promise of power which with which with which the apostles were endued at pentecost is to you jews and your children jews and then them that are far off gentiles and to as many as the lord our god shall call both jew and gentiles until he stops calling the pentecostal message and power will not cease what the church had at pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of god she had the power the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the holy sick ghost that was her in her original condition as jesus went away he told his disciples to terry and uh until pentecost at which time the very same spirit that was upon him would come back and fall upon them and fill them then that called out body the church would be in his dead upon the earth taking his place and because that same spirit that was in him would be in them that would do the same very same works and any people that is truly the body of jesus christ the true church will manifest the same works as jesus did and the pentecostal church because that because the same spirit will be in them and any other church that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to have to give account to god and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at pentecost by experience it will be a pentecostal church and there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecies and healings and god will be in the midst of her and god will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has hallelujah amen no matter what's going on in the age we can thank god that in the last age there will be a true a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ amen now of course he said the church is is no longer the mouthpiece of god and think about it was his smell the mouthpiece of god was it was hagar the mouthpiece of god no god's mouth was speaking the prophecy was ongoing the celebration had begun the rejoicing was going on but the church has its own mouthpiece and so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her amen yes it says in the last chapter revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride said come once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost but of course the word bride will be repudiated mocked rejected cast away as in the first stage cast away by who the bondswoman not by god the bomb's woman for her behavior her and ismail gets sin into tribulation but god will vindicate this bride by the miraculous amen by the miraculous chains of the body by the median in the air by his signs and wonders among us now hallelujah but it's also a fact that the prophet for the last days must be bringing forth a message from god that will forerun the second coming of christ for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the pentecostal fathers and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of the power hallelujah so it looks like we got the true word we're going to have the true power amen as it was to be in the age at this last age was to be when which the true church would return to be in the bride she was at pentecost we know there must have necessity be a return a dynamic power amen what about the true seed it will happen just as we said the people of god are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that's that saith the lord and tell me where he ever failed god will take the church right back to pentecost to the beginning this is what he's doing to sarah this is how she's going to bring forth the supernatural this is why she's bringing forth the super night now in the uncertain sound we're leaving the church in his book and i've just got a couple i want to read to you as we're talking about this church and her renewing was the pentecostal church a noisy church back at the beginning when the holy ghost first fell the virgin mary like she was drunk straggling under the power of god and all of them like that and the people said they're full of new wine mocking that's the way the church was ordained that's the way that the church every church was ordained every time god has a church it'll be that same kind of church because it ain't got no uncertain sound well well i'd be successful i don't care what the bishop says it's what the word says the bishop's got an uncertain sound if his sound is sounding something if his sound is sounding the same thing this is he's right and then if the church don't act like it did like that he's wrong and if you say you got it and didn't act like that there's something wrong with you now you know to be a part of this sinful age and its unbelief you don't have to be smoking drinking lying fornicating stealing committing adultery just simply believe he's not the same does it get you centered to tribulation jesus christ again question answered brother brandon said jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now we're taught that i don't care what you're taught the bible said he said let every man's word be a lie and mind's the truth he said well he's principally the same but i don't you mean he's the same yeah in the church he's doing the same thing that he did when he was here oh i can't believe that you're sinning you're sinning and he that's born of god or the holy ghost don't say those things and if he's got the holy ghost and says those things that's the evidence he hasn't got it i don't care what he's done if he don't believe in divine healing he don't believe in the power of the resurrection he don't believe in the holy ghost being poured out upon us just exactly like he did in the first age just the same god yesterday today and forever the same thing the apostles done happening right now speaking in tongues and rejoicing and all of these other things if they don't believe that he's not born of god for whosoever is born of god did not commit those kind of things that's how to tell whether they're born of god now let's be clear this upper room experience is not a return to azusa street azusa street did not have the upper room experience before they got it they took speaking in tongues first a gift but you see it is a return by malachi 4 to the faith of the fathers amen the literal life of christ notice not not a gift not an anointing the very person of christ abraham would see that for him he said what's what he'd done to abraham see what he'd done to abraham justification justification is churches see sanctification through wesley that great messenger sanctification to pentecost through there pentecost through here pentecost nursing brilliant how many understands that when he was el shaddai he gave his own strength into abraham he never didn't done nothing but made him promise his promises up to them but but now here he's emptying himself into abraham literally how many knows that that was the holy ghost justification what you believe saying to be gay so what the blood doesn't for you you're sanctified by believing but when you're filled with the holy ghost it is the person of the holy ghost himself oh the person not an imagination not some kind of psychology but the person of the holy ghost and you my christian science brother and you that that don't believe the holy ghost as a person he is a personal pronoun the bible said when he the holy ghost has come he will testify me he is a person not a thought he nursed from not from the articles and from the promises but now he had the literal life of god flowing into him and that's what the pentecostal age done and what he become a son now brother branham tells us in the token of the wrath that is coming on the earth and we are in a time of wrath the evening shadows are appearing the wrath is being poured out from on high that's what you're seeing already pre-tribulation plagues insanity coming up on the earth amen it's coming upon professors without a possession it's poured out on ungodly nations it's not just america it's all over upon ungodly believers and brother branham said that he said now we're living in the shadows and the wrath is ready to strike and god is requiring a token a sign that you yourself have received his token the holy ghost it is the only way and the only sign that god will ever pass because it is the literal life of jesus christ return back to the believer so notice what the token is the literal life not a jump not a dance not a gift not a tongue not a prophecy but the person christ coming to live in you now the pentecostal charismatic full gospel oh they gladly embraced the gifts but they rejected the giver and then made a mockery of the holy ghost because he still lived in the sin cutting hair wearing makeup staying in their old formal churches of episcopalian and and whatever else and speaking in tongues what was that making a mockery of the holy ghost but i want you to say you know we we can't just keep pointing out there there there there we got to realize friend we got to avoid the same problem in this movement generally speaking many are guilty of saying we've accepted him while rejecting his gifts i wonder sometimes if the pendulum hadn't swung all the way back the other way if so when you do then you're fulfilling revelation 3 refusing christ mocking and refusing the full gospel and putting christ on the outside of his own church we don't want him in here we don't want his gifts in here we don't want his tongues we don't want interpretation we don't want prophecy we don't want the holy ghost moving we don't want prayer lines we don't want altar calls goodness me we don't want nobody snotting around our altars i ain't talking about out there i'm talking about writing message circles amen now brother adam said in the message oneness he said now the church is engaged to christ for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the lamb so we see that the church is now engaged like a man engaged his wife what does he do while we're while they're engaged he's just bestowing all kinds of things sending her presents making her feel good well that's what christ is doing in his church he's sending us gifts of the spirit how can you be engaged then when you're denying these gifts exist it's the very love tokens it's god's token to the church jesus said so these signs have followed them that believe now keep those things in mind the church must believe every word somebody say everywhere every promise every iota and claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in it if i was engaged to a girl i was a single man i'd send her something an engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it that shows she doesn't believe me she doesn't want to be my bride and if christ sends his church the gifts that he's promised and they refuse them and say they're not so they don't want to be the bride of christ they are espoused to some other lover not to christ the bridegroom so the real church keeps the promise keeps them all and accepts the gifts that god sends them amen now you know you know come on we're having a feast and in the feast there's joy there's excitement there's passion there's good things at the table there's a lot of wine of stimulation to get drunk on we're celebrating the supernatural that god's working among his people hallelujah we're testifying that he heals the sick that not even cancers stand before our prayers that he heals blind brain bleeds that he makes the blind to see amen that he gives hearing to the death amen i know his power i've seen his power on this play are you with me amen but don't be embarrassed to show your joy and your passion and your love you see ishmael identified himself as a bonds woman's son by his reaction to the feast and on the feast table there's all kinds of good things oh brother tim there's mystery yeah there's mystery dishes seven seal when you open it when it's open it breaks the silence on all the rest of them hey man there's great meat and deep deep mysteries and great truths and wonderful grapes and fruits of the spirit and on that table all you have to do if you need healing is have somebody to pass you a dish of healing if you need salvation just ask for it pass it my way i i need a good dose of the holy ghost today amen if you're down in your spirit and you're all depressed amen pass me some of that joy unspeakable and full of glory it's all on the table hallelujah it's a cool banquet oh brother jim you're just trying to advocate some pentecostal gift no i'm not i'm saying every promise is ours everything is on the table it's all ours don't be ashamed of it you see ishmael should have been celebrating hagar should have been celebrated and i wonder sometimes how many get embarrassed when they're shouting dancing in the spirit speaking in other tongues your ishmael the son of a bund's woman mocking you see it's not dignified enough you know they're immature children they're just babies shouting and dancing and rejoicing as it did on the day of pentecost be careful when ishmael mocked isaac god cast him out here it was all right for him to remain with the rest of the believers come on until he marched and when he mocked there came a separation god did it listen when michael when or michelle um mocked david for dancing before the lord she became a cast off unworthy to bear the seed of the king oh you've heard it claimed you've heard it claimed we have the holy ghost without sensation today without feeling or emotion oh no you don't you have emotion jealousy is an emotion pride is a feeling an emotion a sensation and whatever you got is causing a lot of pride and arrogance scorn and contempt for shouting and dancing to the spirit is a feeling it's a sensation but the spirit that does that really isn't the holy spirit it's a spirit of blasphemy now but as ismail who laughed at the offspring of the supernatural so will the children out the bonds woman and they will be cast out into outer darkness where there is wailing and national teeth now now look when god sent them out he didn't just forsake him he they they come through the tribulation and they made a great nation out of them but they wasn't a part of the church anymore that was getting a body change and a promised son now brother branham talks about this embarrassment this scorn this mocking and the message ashamed of him as one of his last sermons he told us about being ashamed he said now when the calling out time comes that you don't belong to any of it it's very popular to say i'm pentecostal it's popular to say i'm presbyterian i'm i'm a lutheran but when it comes to the time where you have to come out and stand for the word i don't belong to any of it that embarrass jesus said if you're saying to me then i'll be ashamed of you why would he be ashamed to you because you're claiming to be his and you won't follow him what if i said this little boy he's my son and he'd turn around and say who me your son what do you think i am it would embarrass me it was you with your son and that's a way that so-called christianity today if you name the name of denomination all right they'll accept the fatherhood of denomination but when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the word of god no they're embarrassed they don't want to say yes i've spoke with tongues i'm still reading yes i've seen vision 1965 jeffersonville amen yes i believe in divine healing yes i praise the lord i'm free from our organization i'm not bowing down to any of that i'm a servant of christ oh that just tears them to pieces to have to do that see the fatherhood of the word notice accepting the fatherhood of the word to be able to say what yes i've spoke with tongues yes i've seen visions yes i believe in divine healing yes i praise the lord amen now again again the fatherhood of the word what kind of children does the word father brother branham told his invisible union he said there's a union going on and there is a woman there in the secret of the jet and she has become pregnated and she's got life in her now watch and see what they are bringing forth notice what kind of children she is burn that tells what that what their papa is whether it's the ad of the first adam or the second adam if the church brings forth the child of the second adam he acts the second adam's way of acting like they did on the day of pentecost that's really the truth second adam's children see their nature is like his and hers now the whole thought of invisible union was a bright elect church whose womb was reserved for the word of god to bring forth his children to bring forth his supernatural life so he sends a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church want any of these see here it's the eastman likes they don't want any of these screaming shouting tongues speaking acts 238 youngins around her yeah she don't want them whooping and crying and screaming hey man hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination they had one like that in one of the churches they tore out right quick why are you letting such stuff as that go on so you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 2 38 miserable creatures she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next council she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind the word can bring thought hallelujah born of the spirit of god it has a spirit of god in it it's no intellectual church joining just coming up and say i believe the message or creed going bob there trimming it off painted face and more makeups come and bold come on no such a thing as that at all you don't find that in the word of god you find an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god amen said the word is preached and the word will give children birth to them kind of children but this embarrasses the israelites and the bondswoman you see as he said and ashamed where they're embarrassed scorned scuffing all of this coming because they're ashamed of the spirit of god he says and how come i can overcome he said you know the holiness groups like nazarenes he's referring to nazarenes and a pilgrim holiness these holiness groups they don't want to they don't want to to say holy ghost anymore because so they say holy spirit because to say holy ghost would identify them with those tongue-speaking people which is the very life and then he goes on and tells how because of rejection of the holy ghost what happened to them that they uh that when the unclean spirit came out through sanctification and they walked in dry places then come other devils had come and lived in them and the last state of the church was worse than the first a man who's once been in contact with god which is the word the word has been made plain and manifested to him there is no shameness about that amen you're not embarrassed it don't embarrass me to say i believe every word of god it don't embarrass me when the lord says to say something and you go and say it do it it doesn't embarrass me to say i've been filled with the holy ghost it don't embarrass me to say i've spoke with other tongues it don't embarrass me to say our lord has shown me visions it don't embarrass me to say he's the same yesterday today and forever amen you see that's the real children but like ishmael mocked abraham's supernatural son if you mock and make light of the supernatural a supernatural birth supernatural gifts supernatural healings god will cast you right out of his redeemed church into the tribulation where there is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth turn with me to galatians chapter 4 and verse 29 but then he that was born out to the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so is it now notice now he said there's a persecution happens notice never nevertheless what say this says the scripture cast out the bonds woman and her son for the son of the bondsman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren and here's my declaration we are not children of the bonds woman but children of the free how many identifies with that today amen we're not children of denomination we're not children of the balanced woman we're children of the free woman [Applause] what happened to israel they were born of the flesh of abraham the promise was originally given to them but on the day of pentecost they mocked and scoffed and ridiculed that 120 that came out of the upper room saying that they were drunk with new wine you see you you see that that's what happened let me tell you something friends it changed them people what came out of the upper room the word did not make them the word that was given did not make them intellectual eggheads a bunch of nerds with studious glasses it made them drunk changed it changed themselves until it even changed their language into a heavenly language but what happened to israel for rejecting the holy ghost like ishmael and hagar they were cast out so it is at this station of time where we're offered el said i the holy ghost the word in full power we cannot reject the word and then the word is everything amen to reject one part of it is reject it all remember all eve had to do was disbelieve one word and the word she disbelieved was he's the same yesterday today and forever and if you don't believe he's the same today that he was them come on amen if you don't believe that what is it you're ishmael's children what's now what's this we cannot reject the word and the word is everything it is the open book and prophecy is in the book tongues is in the book healings in the book miracles in the book righteous holy living is in the book amen you cannot have the holy ghost and reject any part of the word [Music] but they didn't want it so they grabbed the breath to denomination instead and took speaking in tongues as their evidence now a lot of the message folks don't want to nurse from the holy ghost either they're afraid of being called pentecostal they make fun of little isaac those tongue talking acts 238 youngans so they adopt a secular approach like the other denomination that bombs women do of lutheran and baptists claiming the new birth without an experience without and with no emotion it's just something that happens upon the acknowledgment of a believer profession of faith in the message and they too have taken the breath of denomination and nurse on a creed instead of our shady eye the power of the holy ghost and they lean on psychology to change their character their behavior their temperament you see since they reject or know nothing of the power of the holy spirit they have to borrow ideas from other denominations this is what was happening in the pentecostal movement in brother branham's time this is something he struck out against the assembly of god the pentecostals were requiring their ministers pass a test by given by a psychiatrist think about it pentecostals who who were supposed to believe in the supernatural have become so backslidden so yes powerless instead of giving a word examination to see if they had the faith once delivered to the saints they were given them a test given by a psychiatrist psychiatrists psychiatrists the branch of medicine is focused on diagnosing and treating mental health disorders and the term literally means a medical treatment of the soul so you see they were trying to by man's effort treat the soul now hold on to my thought for a minute this is going to get in pretty deep water you see like psychologists psychiatrists use psychotherapy to help their clients so you know again this is the trend the trend the denomination i want you to watch the bonds woman you know to fix the problems in the church of unfaithfulness in marriage immorality teen pregnancies rebellion they brought in psychology because they had lost the power of the holy ghost in other words they were a bankrupt church flied in the spirit of god and it come to rely on man's efforts because ishmael came by man's efforts oh my thought i got a little ways to go on this amen the idea to qualify a ministry think of this the pentecostals did this by a psychiatrist it come from a devilish and poisonous winds blown by satan who had killed the revival in the church and those poisoned whims of satan teaches a person not to believe in the supernatural and that the operation of the power of god is fanaticism and so we have to lean on man's devices to change and reform man now notice this i want you to get what we have today we are not trying to reform you young people are you old amen we are wanting a transformation by the renewing of your mind which comes by the holy ghost not by teaching you a new way of thinking amen you see so again it was spiritual death at work that was in the pentecostal church and i want you to understand that spiritual death keeps rolling right on up because the last plague to strike the church is spiritual death and that's what they were requiring was a mental test performed by psychologists to see if his high iq was high enough to pass the test but god is our test amen did this scripture is our test this is the test these signs shall follow them that believe that's a test of the true ministry you see faith in god a mind that could believe god's word that's the iq that was required on the day of pentecost the proof of the needed iq was that these signs follow them that believe and that iq what's from god was to manifest christ to the people by signs and wonders following them that believe so now instead of giving psychiatrists given a mental test to test to see if a man qualifies for service believers should be given a test to whether he believes god's word or not that ought to be the credential of every preacher if you don't believe the word then there's something wrong with you spiritually and mentally what is needed is men with an experience who preaches god's word and his bible and has god's signs you see that the disciples never went before a psychiatrist i'm going somewhere with this but they waited in the upper room until they were filled with power from on high amen amen that education was not what qualified them nor credentials of a denomination but such as i have amen that was an authorization shown by the power that raised up a at the gate called beautiful and that's what qualified them could you imagine the disciples being required to be examined by psychiatrists first to see whether their response would be to a crisis of sin or you know their response to sin and weak character was not from an intellectual conception or scientific ideology but through the power of god that's how they responded but you see the cycle of of revival and death never fails and i'm telling you right now we got too many psychologists in the pulpit intellectual men who without a call from god are you with me amen jesus movement was existing drifting their behavior was becoming like the older denominations and they moved toward formalism and away from the holy ghost and this was true that every move of god began with the power of the holy ghost but as the revival waned the move become more and more secular and less spiritual in its approach to salvation and deliverance i'm trying to tell you why there's resistance to altar calls life changing experiences is because the church is backslidden it's a backslidden church that doesn't believe in prayer lines altar calls the power of the holy ghost and that introduces psychology to fix the problems counseling is not going to fix your problem the holy ghost baptism and a nature change is what's going to fix your problem amen i'll just tell you right now 20 minutes on your knees and do you more good than 20 minutes in my office dying out to sin we'll do you more good for your marriage for your home for your family get rid of the bitterness get rid of the grudges get rid of the divisiveness [Applause] families are really actually imploding on each other trying to destroy one another what kind of spirit is that it's a spirit of the devil i'm going to call it what it is amen if you got a grudge against your brother your sister you got a devil on you deal with the thing psychology in a counseling session ain't gonna fix it it's when your nature gets changed and you get filled with the holy ghost now to give you the correct attitude toward your wife toward your finances towards your children towards your parents children amen but you see when the revival wanes you see it the church becomes the move comes toward more secular less spiritual approach to salvation and deliverance so they borrow from denominations i hadn't got to where i'm going yet hang on brother branham publicly denounced and warned against the changes that swept over the church as he watched the fall of the pentecostal azusa movement as it drifted toward use of worship or forms of worship without inner significance even speaking in tongues became manufactured and cheapened holiness was no longer an inner work of the heart so it was just rejected as just works and not grace when the true grace of god comes the favor of god in your life the holy ghost it changes your nature and your attitude towards your dress and your behavior amen but the azusa pentecostals could still work up external emotion but there was no lasting change inwardly and so that's why they started introducing psychology because without the power of the holy ghost in their life there was no change of character so we're dealing with people now that you know i've got sin in their lives and they're not prospering spiritually and they're lazy and different backslidden cold formal got sin in their lives and the pastor's now trying to deal with them but instead of the power of god a learned behavior from psychology was now being needed and the same happens again as the cycle repeats pastors bring in i ain't talking about pentecostal pastors i'm about message pastors bringing psychology teaching that the holy ghost is not an experience but something you just grow into dude did you know that some of our did you know that some of our mainstream churches i'm not talking about these out in perugia and thunders and then i'm talking about mainstream churches actually went or sent ministry to sit at the table of the seminars of the bonds women ismailites denominational people at their table to find out how to solve problems because of sin and marriage issues in their churches and this is because the supernatural birth is disdained and despised you see no experience of the baptism of the holy ghost is wanted or needed we sure don't want that altar call we don't want somebody snotting down the daughter you just evolved into a token life you see they somehow believe that you just grow out of your sin problem oh we see a little makeup on our kids you know young people they'll grow out of that no they won't you see the thought that a learned behavior instead of the power of god changing a life comes because of a bankrupt church bankrupt from the power of god the bible said in second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature brother branham always said a creation all things are passed away behold all things become new so when you're a new creation come on all things are passed away behold all things become new so you must be born again by the holy ghost and made a new creation where all the old things pass away sin worldliness desires it's music it stops its books amen it's it's it's feminism every bit of it amen pass away and all things all things become new you see sarah had to be renewed now look i'm one of those old-fashioned kind i don't believe in this evolution stuff i believe that creation began with a big bang the word spoken became an action and the power that god released brought a universe into existence i believe also that this earth and the light upon it and the contaminated universe will be extinguished and will pass away with a great noise amen so you see that's what will happen to the earth heavens and earth will pass so we'll pass away our heavens will pass away with a great noise the bible said is that right amen the whole earth will be on fire brother branham taught this in future home amen he told us you know the fire the earth will be on fire they'll ignite the gases on the earth and explode it and he said the heavens and earth will pass away such an explosion will rock it it's going to kill every disease every thistle every thorn everything should be done the fire will burn it up and remember it's not just a literal fire it's a holy fire and it will take satan away and all his devils hallelujah then he goes on and said when you know when a man receives a baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think it's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that just wait to the earth gets her baptism amen and when your old flesh gets this baptism of fire it kills out sin adultery pornography the world said and it passes away with a great noise hallelujah with a new creation it burns out all sin and sin nature and desire for sin is done away with i believe that's what happens to the fallen man of humanity when he comes to christ it happens with a big bang it cleanses you from sin you see it don't take psychology there's no gradual nature change it's a new creation with a big bang old things are passed away the love for sin sin nature is desires its lust all pass away and behold all things become new amen now let me just give you the signs of a bankrupt church if the church was truly spiritually rich because that's what laodicea claims i'm rich its influence would be felt upon community life but exactly what kind of lives are these so-called spiritual and influential men of the community live and out in the suburbia are out in the better class districts there are balanced wife swapping prostitution bands of children crashing parties exacting terrible toll and property damage immorality has reached an all-time high in promiscuous sex acts and narcotic addictions and gambling and stealing and all kinds of evils that's what happens in suburbia what happens in the slums in the inner cities murders shootings every night and the same kind of morality immorality that's in the suburbs is even more in the slums so the church ain't having too much effect on the community is it so he said the church goes on claiming how fine is this generation how full of the churches and how responsive are the natives on the mission fields the churches turn the people over to doctors even especially the psychiatrists how it can pract about being spiritually rich is more than i know of it it isn't true they are bankrupt and don't know it come on now and we're a bankrupt church when we have to depend on psychology to fix our children and psychology to fix our marriage and psychology to understand how to save your pennies and and pay off your debts and be responsible with your money i'll tell you what you really need is the holy ghost it'll change your attitude about life amen some of you who never tithe will start tithing you put god first you give offerings unto the lord you'll see the fruits of it amen you'll see some principles start happening in your life i'm talking the truth now you'll see some changes start happening you there'll be attitude changes about work about family about your friends your associates your business dealings everything comes under the holy ghost but today pastors are desperate because of sin they're using psychology to conform or reform their people and this is used in marriage counseling money management and i'm going back several several years ago now the rage was bill gothard this is what i'd hear among the pastors bill gothard and message pastors went to went to classes by bill gothard to learn how to get character development you know to get character development into the christians you know uh to help with their marriages to learn principles of how to be a a family and christian educational and they were going out here to the ishmael's lights to bill gothard to learn his psychology to bring it i'm not talking about pentecost out here listen brother branham decried the pentecostals for putting their people out there before psychiatrists i got the right to do the same thing to message people and hold them accountable for bringing psychology into the church and it was because of backslidden preachers who denied the power of god who spurned the movement of the holy ghost and the problem with bill gothard was after all his seminars on marriage and christian living was caught up in sex scandals himself what he taught didn't even work on himself and then these things pastors listen i'm not lying you go to convention and laying out with books on james dobson christian psychology and and out here take these home read these learn this this will help you with your rebellious child this is going to help you with your marriage this is going to help you with your finances and and this is where we're going to fix the problems of the church not with an altar call not with a consecration to god not by surrenders to the holy ghost but by psychology which was boring from the israelites the bomb's woman whilst guarding the holy ghost amen i know i know exactly what i'm talking about let me tell you something friendship don't hybrid this message don't mix psychology in it amen god's word plus psychology produces psychoheresy you see true christianity does not change the mind it gives a new mind amen james dobson you read about him he went to the vatican united with the pope oh he did you see it's a bankrupt church that uses psychology to reform his people the gospel is not about reforming it's about transforming amen and i just say quit defending psychology repent of that amen preaching the gospel does not move the man it does move the mind to man and it's thinking from sin and worldliness toward christ and changing his mind and setting his affections upon things above in order to bring in repentance but only filling the soul with god changing the nature doesn't have the desired effect of salvation the indwelling of the holy ghost is the only true change it's the holy ghost that dissolves fears and gives it inward peace amen it changes the entertainment of the spirit from dirty carnal music and jokes to an old-fashioned praise for god amen it puts a love for god in your heart it puts a desire for righteousness you see introducing psychology to change behavior does not deal with the root problem of sin it only helps with the symptoms you see the the root problem is still there ready to raise up at the most inopportune time amen but instead of psychiatrists believers or have the leadership of the holy ghost directing our thoughts and our attitudes and it changes our lives and our behaviors by giving us the mind of christ american the mind of christ is the holy ghost it causes us to have a christ-like attitude and outlook on sin so you see the last plague of spiritual death oh my what are you seeing embalming fluid put into the church let me tell you something the holy ghost is not outdated it still works i can testify it'll make sainted men and women amen brother bradham said how many understands when else shall i that he gave his own strength in abraham he never did nothing but made him promise his promises but now he's emptying himself out into abraham literally when you're filled with the holy ghost it's the person of christ himself the person not imagination not some kind of psychology but the person of the holy ghost you see he nursed from he nursed the literal life of god into him so having this literal life of god flowing in makes him believe in the supernatural the holy ghost makes you believe it's not an external religion but it's on the inside working out it flows like a river of water it bubbles up into eternal life like the spring that brother branham saw and he said what makes you so bubbly and happy is it because i drink out of your rabbits and deer or whatever he said no there's a power down there that is pushing up this water amen and it's making me bubble and he said there's something about the baptism of the holy ghost amen it makes him believe the supernatural it makes him believe in god amen it makes him believe he's the same yesterday today and forever and if you're born of god you will believe in the supernatural amen i'll tell you what we got proof of it we got the young pre people we got people right here that have been transformed by the power of god one after another that we can call it wasn't just easy believism their life was changed hallelujah what happened to you brother johnny amen your life got changed amen you didn't get reformed you got transformed [Applause] amen it was but it was not without emotion it had emotion with it it was with not without sensation it's not sensation but it has sensation with it amen that's why the prophet of god cried out against emotion without the word or word without emotion but you see brother branham said in question answers he said take it by the scripture if a man that's born of god is born of god he believes every word of god wrote and says he's just as great today as he ever was and he never changes and he's the same yesterday today and forever and if he's filled with the holy ghost he got the same holy ghost that he got that he gave on the day of pentecost and it makes him act the same way and do the same thing if he's born of the spirit of god mark 16 these signs shall follow them to believe if he says i'm a believer and them signs don't follow he's a make-believer not a believer oh they claim today we don't have the holy ghost like they had on the day of pentecost they claim we got something different they claimed that 1906 was the upper room happened again and it wasn't that's a lie 1906 of zeus of pentecost was the holy spirit baptizing with gifts that's not we have we have the person come on justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the holy ghost which gave the gift and the baptism of the holy ghost gives way to the person himself you see this is what god wanted them to have they wanted to have his own life into the church and brother branham identified himself with the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost now so we are false teachers with a false birth the children of this word are not empty bubble dancers that's not who we are but we are people who live higher than what we jump amen neither are we a bunch of stillborn mixed between sheep and goats amen who never breathed the breath of life stillborn babies but the holy ghost that's still born you know just they're just lifeless blobs of theology and that's what the church is producing they lifeless blobs of theology who can't live without overcoming life but we're showing you an isaac a child of the supernatural and you can make fun of him and you can walk him oh you want to at this celebration but i tell you what it's proof that the rapture is at hand because there is a church being renewed like she was on the day of pentecost and that's why she's bringing back forth and isaac hallelujah you see false teachers will bring false false births amen false prophets bring forth false births and we're seeing it false births being brought but there's also a birth that's coming forth that burst you back to the place where you should have been born at the beginning where god's bringing forth sons and daughters of god i can point you to a word-born pride that's what we're pointing to a word born bride i'm pointing you that we're having a feast amen we can feast on every promise amen right here from this pulpit and other pulpits like it around the world we're not the only one by any means amen there's many others that are proclaiming the truth they can pray they can preach the seven thunders they can preach the mystery revealed they can preach the silence that's been broken amen they can identify the church ages and and the spirits down to the angels they can identify the messenger somebody help me preach they can it's all on the table but on our table is every divine promise amen on our table is divine healing they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen they're in on our table is the holy ghost and the power of god and the salvation and it's not just a psychology it's the holy ghost at work are you with me church that's what we're having in this day oh word bird bride and word born children acts 2 38 tongues preaching blabbering shouting screaming amen and if you see us getting a little happy we're having a feast and if you see us shouting a little bit and acting a little unseemly it's called life supernatural life is being manifested and if you see rejoicing and shouting and people they're running the aisles don't knock us and make fun of us join in with us we're celebrating life i'll tell you what don't let it go it's me alike steal your joy don't get embarrassed of this gospel don't get ashamed of the gospel of christ it is the power of god and salvation my fatherhood is the word and the word is bringing forth lively children children with power children with life and we're not ashamed to say we have the word of power we're not ashamed to say the sound of the king is in our midst we're not a shout we're not afraid we're not afraid to rejoice yes we do speak with tongues yes the spirit of prophecy is among us yes we are the bride yes we're the old church that was so old but now we got a spring in our step now the wrinkles are going because there'll be a bride without a spot or a wrinkle or blemish or any such thing amen now we got a bride like she was on the day of pinnacle now we got a renewed church of renewed people with renewed power and we got it from nursing on the holy ghost el shaddai name of the lord hallelujah you can say amen amen praise the name of the lord
