we're going to see tonight your word can never fail Lord I'm so thankful tonight that no matter how much time passes no matter how much the devil attacks no matter how much scoff or scoff your word is unchanging and unfailing Lord and as part of that word your bride is rising to her position taking her place Lord Lord I'm so thankful to know that we've been predestinated not to fall I'm thankful tonight Lord to know that you're the chief Captain leading in the charge Lord I just pray that you'll come now and anoint these words anoint Lord everything that we would say strengthen us Lord God lord we can put things together and think of ways to say things but Lord if you if you don't come and you don't anoint what is it Lord Lord I just pray tonight that you'll come and take control Lord that our faith tonight will be elevated by the word Lord to the level of the promise tonight that we can receive all all that you have for us father we commit it all into your hands now Lord in Jesus name we pray amen and amen amen amen if you have your Bibles and you'll turn with me to habac cook the second chapter we're going to read from the first verse amen it's it's good to be with you again we we missed on Sunday we we thank you so much for for all your prayers my my family was attacked with the with the flu and sickness and and uh I'm kind of just now back on my feet I'm I'm well don't worry about that but my body is still trying to gain back its strength if I get to to hacking up here well we'll be all right we'll get through it and you know brother Tim is not heartless I want you to know that he actually called me and said he'd be glad to take the service and I you know but like I told him I said look when you're only called upon every now and then it's kind of hard to call in sick it's like hey I I know you ain't needed me in a while but you're going to have to take this one too I said I just couldn't do that you know and and so I wanted to step up tonight and and and play my part amen I just pray that you'll bear with us we're doing well the family's well and we're thankful for that tonight amen amen Hab a cook too verse one in this first verse he says I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved and you know that that verse really stuck out to me and I know he's a prophet and he's speaking prophetically but we're also a prophetic class of people and I think that we ought to have this same attitude tonight Lord I'm going to stand upon my watch I I I'm going to I'm going to keep an open eye I'm I'm I I'm gonna pay attention to what's going on and and set me upon the tower I'm not going to be lack a daaco tonight Lord I'm not just going to sit by and let everybody else do the looking and everybody else do the watching but I'm going to do my watching and I'm going to watch and see what you're saying to me personally and I'm going to find how you're dealing in my life and my home so that I can answer Amen in verse two says and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t amen I pray that the Lord will add his Blessing tonight as you have your seats and so with those things being said you just bear with me tonight maybe a different pace I'm not sure how how this will go and I don't plan to keep you long tonight but this is just kind of I guess what the Lord laid on my heart I I'll call it a New Year's message it's it's my first time to preach in the New Year 2025 and you we've just come into January and and I'm thankful that the Lord has brought us to another year I'm I'm thankful that that he has been with us and and I can say tonight that I found him faithful I I I found him to be true I you know I found the scripture to be true that many are the afflictions of the righteous but I've also found it to be true that he delivereth him out of them all all amen and and we stand here in a place that I figure many never expected to stand 2025 you know and what what we find is the devil the devil likes to use the passage of time as a way to bring in doubt and unbelief he uses the the passage of time as do you really think this could be because look how long it's been that promise was given thousands of years ago or hundreds of years years ago or even in the case of the message that prophecy went forth 70 years ago and he uses the passage of time to bring doubt and unbelief and confusion but I want us to kind of look at the passage of time a little different tonight as I was looking at this I thought you know the passage of time is only a countdown to fulfillment it's not going the wrong direction it's not oh no it's getting so long it it's counting the other direction it's counting Moment by moment and second by second second closer and closer to the Fulfillment so so it's a countdown tonight to the Fulfillment of the word of God Amen and and tonight as like I said as a New Year's message I kind of want to look a bit at at where we are what are we expecting and and what is our mindset going forward because what happens with the passage of time is is what we want to see in our own lives is that we get stronger and stronger as the days go by we' like to think another day is gone by and I've overcome so I've so I've gotten stronger in the faith and a and and I've grown stronger and and you know I want it to be to be said of us like it is of Abraham that who against hope believed in hope and being not weak in the faith he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in the faith and I want it to be said of my life and of evening light Tabernacle that in 2025 we're more determined than ever before we're more dedicated than ever before and more consecrated than ever before stronger than ever before excited just as the day when we first got saved but the truth is human nature is opposite of that the truth is that human nature is to relax the further we go along to let the guard down the further we go along and the further we go long the Gap should be widening between us and the things of the world and yet actually what you see is the gap narrowing whereas you should see more dedication to the house of God more dedication to prayer more dedication to reading your Bible you're seeing less dedication because time has passed time has has gone on and and and we get we get comfortable in our surroundings the longer that we remain in them and now combine human nature with the spirit of the age which is lukewarmness so it's already our nature to to to slack off as time goes on now you add that in with the fact that brother Brandon would talk about soft living and and and and easy lives compared to what's gone on in the past and then you see in Revelation three as Jesus would describe the age as as a lukewarm age that he's going to spew out of his mouth and and you combine those things together and we find our ourselves in a very dangerous place brother Tim referenced it on Sunday as he spoke about the condition of the message movement and just a few weeks back I'd been looking at a thought more than a movement and Revival and death has been constant through time it has never failed and it won't fail this time it's nothing new movements die that's what they do every movement down through time has died the Lutheran movement eventually lost Steam and died Wesley's movement eventually lost Steam and died the isusa movement lost Steam and died and if you look into movements of any kind whether it be a social movement or whether it be a religious movement what you'll find is the thing that brings success is unity and the thing that brings its downfall is power struggles and factionalism that erode that Unity things that come in and begin to draw the focus away from the goal and and and and people just begin to settle into their norms and settle into their traditions and well this is how we do it and this is how I see it and this is how my pastor believes it and more energy begins to be put into internal struggles than to prog pressing further down the road different ideas different viewpoints begin to raise up and over time people begin to dig in on which way they see it and it becomes a Creed and it becomes a dividing line well we see it this way oh that's the way your church sees it and and pretty soon what ends up happening is it a disassociation of fellowship and well we don't really fellowship with them because they believe this and we don't fellowship with them because they see this this way and it dies right there it becomes faction and and denomination is what it is and God hates it and sure maybe the name goes on and on and on there Still Remains if you look around you can find lutherans and there's still remains of of of the life that was in Wesley there are Pentecost churches all over the place Louisiana has Pentecostal churches everywhere living a name but they're dead they're dead so what I'm saying to you tonight isn't that there's anything wrong with the message what I'm saying you tonight is make sure that you're in more than a movement make sure that you've been caught up to to more than a movement but make sure that the life that stirred that movement to begin with the life that fanned the Flames to begin with that that life is on the inside of you tonight make sure it's not just a movement but the life behind the movement has gotten down on the inside of you it's not so important tonight whether or not you can answer the question are you in the message but can you answer the question is the message in you that's the difference that's what we're looking for not not just I abide by a set of rules and I live life a certain way and I believe God sent a prophet that those things are wonderful but that's part of the movement but we're going to stand here and Shout what we've always shouted have you been born again have you been filled with the spirit of almighty God have you met him face to face for yourself that's the question because the life that was in Luther didn't die the movement died the life carried on for the to the to the furtherance of restoration and the life that was in Wesley didn't die the life carried on and so on with the Zeo of the life didn't die the movement died to where we end up standing today and the the movement may die away but the light life of this message will not die make sure that you know the one behind the message make sure you know the life of the message amen then it won't matter what happens to the movement it won't matter who falls away this church can fail that church can fail this friend can fall away you won't fade away because that life is eternal life amen then you're not anchored to a movement you aren't anchored to a theology or anchored to a Doctrine you're anchored to the solid rock and that Rock tonight is Jesus Christ amen this message tonight is Jesus Christ many times we confuse the message with the movement or we confuse the message with with what men have made out of it or what men say it is or what men build with the message and what men do with the message will fail and what men say the message is will fail and and what men lift up as the message it may fail but Jesus Christ the word of God the message of the hour it can never fail the message cannot fail because the word cannot fail amen this message is Christ and Christ cannot fail it's an unfailing word that we have tonight amen it doesn't matter about the passage of time it doesn't matter how long that we have to wait the word cannot fail we can anchor Our Lives to that tonight and so we stand here tonight facing another year 2025 and I asked you what are you anchored to tonight hopefully not evening like Tabernacle hopefully not to the family you were born in or how good mama is or how good daddy is or or that you believe the message but you got to be anchored that the life of Jesus Christ is on the inside of you you got to be anchored that you know that you know that you know that you know because we're staring at another year another Milestone the passage of time and looking at all the time that has gone by and it it seems sometimes like things will just go on forever it seems like nothing's happening and the attitude becomes exactly what it said there in second Peter 2 Peter 3 and 3 it says knowing this first that there shall come in the last day scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation and with that attitude ude comes a level of comfort things are how they've always been sure I'm a Believer yeah but I mean nothing's changed I'm I'm 18 and I've been hearing the same message for 18 years and it seems about the same now as it was then I'm 40 and they've been saying the coming of the Lord I me I believe I believe but who knows it may not even be in my lifetime maybe it's later but things are just like they've always been and you fall into a level of comfort to where you don't have the same anticipation when you gather together in the house of God you don't expect the miraculous quite the same you don't expect his appearing quite like you did you don't have the same vigilence or the urgency that we once had and none of us none of us would ever say that we don't believe he's coming none of us would ever say that that we don't believe that it's any day oh sure it's any day now yeah absolutely but our lack of urgency and our lack of vigilance would indicate that his coming is not Upon Us did you live today as if his coming was tonight do you live I'm not saying do you say because I believe we would all say but does the urgency of our life does the urgency of our walk does it indicate that we believe that because we can say what we want but our lives indicate to him how we truly feel how much we believe our lack of urgency and our lack of vigilance would say we have plenty of time and now if nothing else just allow me to preach this to myself because this is what the Lord laid on my heart for me and my life going into 2025 because the secret of his coming is the beauty of the Gospel in that it's set up in a way that you have to be ready because you don't know but let me tell you like this even if that wasn't a secret even if God came down and spoke and revealed tonight my coming is in the year 20 240 that has nothing to do with you and when you're going to meet God and the Lord's just been dealing with with me and are you living as if it's today are you giving everything you [Music] can and and as you examine your life and you and you put it up with the mirror of the word you have to be willing to admit the places you have fallen short and it's not that he's condemning you he's saying there's more for you there's a deeper walk there's a greater experience there's more unfolding I've I've got more for you than I've ever had before and he's just waiting on you to take that step waiting on you to take that extra step to give a little bit more because the Cry Of My Heart Tonight is don't be rocked to sleep don't get comfortable here because the vision is for an appointed time and it shall not lie the cogs of God's word have never stop grinding and although it seems sometimes to T the word will come to pass we're preaching tonight about the cogs the grinding of the cogs they never stop they never stop turning even if we think everything's the same they've turned and if they've turned the gears have moved you can sit here and look at that clock and that minute hand don't seem to be moving but inside the cogs are turning and just ask a preacher you look up in a minute and it's been moving even though you can't see it you look around and all things are the same brother and all things are the same they're not the same the cogs are turning we're getting closer and we're getting closer we're closer now than we've ever been before and I say that the time is upon us now to make sure make your calling an election sure go beyond I'm in the message go beyond I I gave my heart to the Lord 30 years ago wonderful wonderful but make sure tonight that you know that you know because the cogs are steadily turning every promise and every prophecy has a place now I want you to get this because like I said the devil likes to come in with time and the passage of time and it's 2025 y'all thought y'all have been out here in the 70s y'all thought y'all have been out here in the 80s y'all thought it'd be evil too evil in that and here you are 2025 but every promise and every prophecy has a place just picture this now where the Eternal Word and time intersect where the Eternal Word and time intersects and at that place of intersection is fulfillment where the prophecy intersects with time and we know time is is like a a straight line and and and we even know that you know brother brandham could could go back on that line to a place and see something that happened in someone's life and tell them we're standing here today because this happened on this line but then he could speak a word that would land further down the line and say I'll shake your hand outside of the blue board restaurant now that would travel along in eternity while he traveled along in time but there come a place there come a point where the eternity and the time would intersect once again and at that intersection what you'll find is fulfillment amen and Satan will do everything he can to keep you from realizing that fulfillment is upon you to keep you from recognizing that you're right at the place of fulfillment to keep you distracted and to make sure that you're seeing the trouble all around and make sure you're seeing the faults and the issues so that as you approach that intersection the intersection catches You by surprise the Lord has done everything in this day to make sure that doesn't happen he's gone to extremes he's gone to Great Links to make sure you know your day in its message he's gone to Great Lengths and I want to be sure to The Cry of my heart is Lord I want to be ready I don't want to miss it I want to make sure that I'm watching and waiting that that I'm sighing and crying and that I'm on the edge of my seat with anticipation Lord let this be the day of your appearing Lord let this be the service that you move in a mighty way Lord let me be on the edge of my seat waiting no matter how old the story is no matter how long it's been no matter how long ago the promise was given there's an appointed time for the Fulfillment of all things and we are grinding towards that moment we're coming towards that intersection Genesis 18:14 says is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son I just got several of these in here so you understand everything has a time appointed brother Aaron I've been holding on for my child a long time at the time appointed brother Aon I've been holding on for my I've been sick a long time and I've been battling at the time appointed he's going to return to you for all his promises there is a time appointed Daniel 8:19 and he said behold I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end shall be oh listen make no mistake about it there's coming an end time make no mistake about it there's going to be a Rapture there is a day that a time appointed the end shall be acts 7:17 and when the time of the promise Drew nigh which God had swarmed to Abraham the people grew and multiplied in Egypt verse 18 Till till another king arose which knew not Joseph when did this happen when the time of the promise Drew nigh and Satan keeps coming around going see it's been so long it's been so long and we're going devil it's just counting down it's just counting down as an eternal being devil I'm not worried about it you should be the one worried with how long it's taken because you have a limited amount of time I do not I'm an eternal being I'm not worried about how long God said it that settles it that's my anchor I don't care if it's 2020 20201 22 23 24 or 25 I'm anchored in an eternal word hallelujah brother Aaron is 2025 I I thought surely by now brother Aaron if this were all true how come listen there is not one thing out of cater tonight there isn't one thing going wrong the Fulfillment of the word and the Rapture of the church is right on schedule and it's as true tonight as it's ever been the word is true tonight I know we live in an age and the world wants us to doubt everything and it's a scientific age trying to prove everything wrong but tonight the word is true his promises are true they are Eternal they cannot fail they were true back then they were true in brother bram's day they'll be true tomorrow and they'll be true all through 2025 God's word is the truth tonight his promises are true and the cogs grind continuously on prophet of God says now therefore let's go back now and get the beginning and find out how sure this word is now bear this in mind and as we glean Through the Bible you'll see that the cogs of God's will turn slow but sure it may look like it's a million miles away but she's grinding right up there all the time and one of these days it'll be here no matter what he says the people begin to get ready taskmasters beating children slain the hour of the cogs of God's prophetic will had ground up to the time listen I want you to get this I believe they've ground up to it again I believe we're here that's the reason I think that things are the way they are now the old prophetic clocks ticked right up to nearly the Zero Hour don't let the devil convince you otherwise excuse me we're at the Zero Hour young people I know what it's like to feel like you got forever and you wake up and you're 44 I celebrated my brother's 50th birthday yesterday man right now I can go back in my mind playing football in the yard with him we was kids yesterday and to some of you you kind of chuckle at that but the old ones know what I mean we was kids yesterday happens like that you don't have forever we're at the zero hour and I want to say it again even if there was another 20 30 40 years what's that mean to you you're not promised tomorrow make it count tonight give him every moment of your life cuz the devil will come and convince we got plenty of time oh it's not as bad as they say and I remember one time it's funny how you hear through different ears there was a prodal in the service years ago and I was serving the lord he wasn't he had not been there in years and he was in a service and I met him afterwards you know and I was going to reinforce what had been said from the pull pit I said you know I know we heard a lot today about how bad things are and I was going to say but it's probably even worse than what we realize but he cut me off and said yeah they're not near that bad are they and I thought we're hearing through different filters we're seeing the world through different filters one of us has been convinced that there's plenty of time one of us has been convinced that we're not right here on the edge of the coming of the Lord but I want you to know tonight that we are living in the season of change you know Seasons blend fall Blends in into winter winter Blends into spring there there's signs of spring you may walk outside and it still feels like winter and you got to have a coat on but you can see days are getting a little longer and there's some green Buds and it's not spring but it's blending I believe with all my heart Time and Eternity have already begun to blend I'm still looking around I'm seeing a lot of winter I'm seeing a lot of death I'm seeing a lot of this world but there's signs all around me that say the Son of God is coming the sun is coming up we're blending into eternity the seasons are blending it's the season of change our bodies are getting ready to be changed forever there's signs of it and you know it's coming even before you can actually declare that the season has changed and as you approach an intersection if you're paying attention there are signs letting you know that you're approaching an intersection slow down pay attention stop ahead caution ahead whatever the sign may be but it gives you a heads up that the intersection is coming if you're paying attention you'll see these caution ahead and I say tonight that the signs are all around us that there's an intersection just ahead there is an intersection just ahead where time once again and the prophecy are going to intersect and there's going to be fulfillment we're right here approaching another intersection and I say tonight get focused pay attention slow down Time and Eternity are blending the time of the promise is drawing nigh what signs brother Aaron what are you seeing as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot the Bible tells us in the last days perilous time shall come signs are you not seeing the same signs that I'm seeing lovers of themselves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God signs I'll give you another one here's a sign brother brandom 1965 let me prophesy something to you just before it comes to pass the whole world is groping in insanity and it will get worse and worse and worse until there'll be a bunch of Maniacs just saw that one go by we're there signs there's an intersection just ahead slow down pay attention lock in refocus there's an intersection just ahead well brother Aon another year pass and nothing happened wake up a lot has happened and a lot is happening there's an intersection just ahead where time is going to intersect with the prophecy and someone is going to be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye that's where we're at that's the Fulfillment that's the junction of time where we stand that prophecy is't just going to float around out there forever and ever and ever but there comes a point where it comes down and intersects with time and we step into eternity and our immort our mortality then puts on immortality brother BR says now before that could take place which God had said God had to have this nation ready he had to have the people ready and then he had to have Moses ready to go to go down there God makes everything work together right just like cogs coming together we see it off sometime in the distance and wonder could it ever be but it always happens just the way God said it would and when the time of the promise Drew nigh there come a pharaoh who did not know Joseph and then at the same time of the persecution and killing of the little children God sent Moses a Prophet come on the scene and miracles and signs begin to happen in the age because the time of the age was finished there come a time where the Hebrew children had to make a stand whether they're going to bow down to a heathen image or whether they're going to keep their faith in the same true Living God the time came where the decision must be made and they made the right decision and God was with them I believe that's where we stand tonight that it's decisionmaking time the time has has come the time has come tonight evening like Tabernacle to cast down doubt and unbelief the time has come to stand against the fears that consume our homes and consume Our Lives the time has come to stand against the things that divide us to stand for truth to stand for Unity to stand for the word of God the time has come for each and every one of us to go further with God than we've ever gone before not to stop short and make a decision are we going to continue in 2025 as halfway lukewarm Believers that get spewed out of his mouth when time and prophecy intersect are we going to go all the way in be on fire for God sold out I say make the right decision tonight stand up and be counted and say as for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord with all of our heart make the right decision go all in I'm not going to Coast through 2025 caught up in the lukewarmness caught up in the haze of the age missing what God is doing you can sit here every single service and Miss what God's doing he can be moving all around you and you miss what God's doing callous to his voice callous to his moving man we never get like that little boy brother brand talked about in the 10 cent store said his mama was going around and finding all these things and shaking it in front of him he just stared off in the distance she began to scream and people came like what's the matter it was just like he was in a trance nothing would get his attention the things that should attract a little boy and she'd shake it and he'd just stare and she'd shake it and he'd just stare and nothing that nothing that she would do would get his attention nothing would grab a hold of him don't get to the place where nothing moves us where Nothing grabs our attention listen I'll speak to the message Movement we have been so blessed with Incredible preachers we've heard sermons that shake hell we've we've seen the miraculous over and over again we've seen Deliverance time after time so many things that we've seen and we and we've heard and the greatest gifts of God that he ever handed out has preached to us how dare us get to a place where it doesn't attract us to where we aren't impressed by the word in our midst God has shook so much and we've heard so much and we've seen so much what does it take to excite us anymore wh wh maybe excite is not the right word what does it take to stir us what what does it take to grip us I'll tell you what it takes when you get to that place it's real simple you've left your first love all you got to do is say Jesus let me fall in love with you again tonight I just want to fall in love with you again tonight let it be like the first time let me feel that Embrace again let me feel that forgiveness again let me feel that passion again Lord let me recognize again how much I needed you and how much you reached down for me when I wasn't worthy I was lost and Bound for Hell in a prison I didn't deserve you but you came from Glory you opened my prison and you set me free let me fall in love with you again Lord fall in love again to where you're excited to be a Christian excited about the message to where you're gripped by his Spirit you're in a of is moving because I'm not going into 2025 in a days I'm not going in under the fog of Le osia missing intersections missing the unction of the spirit but I want to be dialed in tonight I don't want to miss one opportunity not one service do I just want to let go by and just be there not One Moment In His presence not one move I don't want to miss one blessing I want to be like those wise men they were looking for him brother Brown says why didn't anybody else see it the world was full of people who watched the Stars that's what they did that's how they knew the weather and the time and the this they watched the skies but why didn't they see that star they weren't looking for that star why can't he come through a service and move and people weep and and shout and be moved on to worship and people weep their way to Calvary and some people walk out and say I didn't see nothing cuz you weren't looking for it he comes and appears to those that are looking for him brother brand I'm talking about the wise men he says and the greatest star of All Stars the greatest of all moved right by the scientific world and they never saw it why they wasn't expecting it but there was some wise men who heard balam's prophecies that there'd be a star out of Jacob rise they was expecting it they were looking for it they found it they followed it they were looking for it he says I'm looking for something aren't you I want to be like the wise men I say tonight I've seen it I've found it and I'm following it tonight and wherever it leads me wherever it takes me Lord I will follow you tonight with my whole heart oh brother Aaron 2025 is going to be a bad year the evil and the falling away and the politics nope not for me it's not going to be a bad year 2025 is going to be a great year because I'm looking for a Star to rise I'm looking for prophecy to be fulfilled I'm looking for Mighty outpourings of the spirit I'm coming to church with Great Expectations I'm going to have victory in 202 five like I've never had before I'm going into this year going it's going to be wonderful it's going to be Mighty it's going to be awesome that's what I'm looking for because God's word is going to be fulfilled his promises are going to come to pass they canot fail Satan can't stop it and despite what some of y'all think who get all caught up in it politics can't stop it Joe Biden can't stop it Donald Trump can't stop it that man says some wild stuff y'all I try not to pay no attention but now Canada is a 51st state and we're going to get Greenland or something like that I Panama I'm like man can we just get our taxes lowered before we start Conquering the world man's wild but they can't stop it we have to get to the place that we realize that they're all just Pawns in the hand of God as bad as people thought Obama was Pawn only able to do what God allowed him to do as bad as people thought Joe Biden was he was but he's a pawn on in the hand of God listen imagine I imagine all the politic followers back in Jesus day sat around and did all kind of griping about Caesar when he said they had to go back and be taxed they sat around and griped and moaned and said why does Rome have to control everything why does Rome dictate what goes on on this Earth not no in Rome didn't have one single thing to do with it God moved upon him to fulfill his word because his word has to be fulfilled so God said send them back to their home to be taxed because I got a savior coming and he's going to be born in a certain place and I'm going to move the pawns where I want to move the pawns to fulfill my word he's just getting us where he wants us so he can take us home church quit given so much credit to all these idiots what a hardship all the traveling and all the griping and yet God's cogs were grinding brother Brown says now in these days there was great persecution of the church Caesar Augusta had made a great plan that he would tax all the people and that was only done for one purpose that God's Great prophecy would be fulfilled what is it brother Aaron time intersected with the word and there was a season of fulfillment Time After Time prophecy after prophecy I want to go through a few of them here just so we begin to understand that time doesn't matter Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a ver virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel that laid there for over 700 years but there came a time of intersection Micah 5 and two but thou Bethlehem euphrat though thou be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall come forth unto me that is to be the ruler in Israel whose goings forth have been from old from Everlasting that's why the tax it had to be Bethlehem Isaiah 53 and5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed and this is one that has multiple contacts with the timeline it laid there forever until Time and Eternity came together and he took a beating and then it continues to lay there until my timeline needs it and it comes in contact with it and then your timeline needs it and it comes in contact with it and then your timeline needs it and it comes in contact with it and time after time there's an intersection with the time being and an eternal word and it intersects once again and there's healing and there's Deliverance because it's an eternal word that comes in contact Time After Time with the timeline of humanity Psalms 22:17 I may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me who knew all those years later he would hang on the cross and they could stare at his bones and this would come in contact with time and an eternal word there would be a spark and there'd be fulfillment Eternal words that had an appointment in time it does not matter how long it takes once the word is released it is a seed sewn it is a seed sewn and every seed brings forth of its kind so when you release a the seed of healing and put it in the ground prepare for a harvest of healing you release the seed of Salvation it's going to work salvation you release a seed of Deliverance if it's from the word it's going to produce a harvest of Deliverance amen and that seed that goes forth is going to bring forth every single time because it can't fail that's what I'm trying to get to you tonight don't be discouraged don't get disillusioned it's as failing tonight as it's ever been it's just as sure tonight as it's ever been brother Brown says if you believe this to be God's Eternal unchangeable Word then every precept that's been spoke in God's word is a seed and everything that God has spoke of in the word is already confirmed in glory and it's been given to you to act upon so don't be afraid to take any phrase any phase of God's Eternal blessed word and anchor it in your heart he says there's where reason I believe in that word and I believe that the word is a seed and if that seed is sewed in the right ground and watered by the Holy Spirit it will bring forth of its kind any promise that God made God will do it amen what are you saying tonight brother and what's your New Year's message I'm saying lock in tonight refocus tonight because it doesn't matter how long it's been it doesn't matter how long ago you planted it there are some seeds that you have planted that you are getting ready to harvest in 2025 there are some things about to come up you may not even remember it's there because you planted it and you watered it and you cultivated and you said Lord I trust you with it and now here comes the Harvest that you planted because those seeds of the word of God can't fail and if you hadn't planted I say start planting tonight here's my son here's my daughter here's my marriage I'm going to plant it I'm going to cultivate it and I'm going to leave in faith and say Lord do the work I'm Gonna Leave it right here but I'm G to have a harvest CU Harvest time is upon us the cogs have ground slow but sure Hallelujah you've got some intersections coming up just ahead Church Hallelujah you're nearing the intersection where time is catching up to the promise oh hallelujah hallelujah I planted a seed of healing brother Aon I planted a seed of Joy I planted for peace I planted for my prodal yes sir and there's going to be a great harvest there's going to be a great harvest at the appointed time light strikes the seed and it must bring fourth of its kind I say once again it's going to be a good year Hallelujah I'm expecting a mighty Harvest I'm expecting great things because I know the seeds that have been planted and I know that the seed cannot fail to produce amen locked in listening locked in and expecting watching determined because we're in the season of change the cogs of the gears are grinding steady forward and time is catching up to the prophecies don't be distracted by time slipping away don't get caught up in the cares of life just look around the world itself is fully catching up to the Prophecies of the day Sodom wickedness lovers of pleasure you say well brother Aaron there's always been homosexuals in the world why is this botom there's always been wickedness there's always been people heady and high- minded and Truce Breakers and there's always been disobedient children sure down through the years much has been fulfilled in portions just like on the positive side portions of scripture that were fulfilled in portions but there Comes A Time of the fullness there Comes A Time of complete fulfillment cuz we're in in the age where these prophecies reach their fullness yes there's been wickedness yes there's been Rebellion but never has it reached to the level it has now where the Prophet would prophesy and say it will get worse and worse and worse until there'll be a bunch of Maniacs think about that's how he described the world not there's going to be a lot of good people you know but evil is going to increase and and there'll be a lot of no what's the world going to be a bunch of maniacs the cup of the amorites is full her sins have reached into heaven The Cry of Sodom is so great it has once again reached into heaven it's the season of change and you can see it even in the devil's children see because he's not original in anything he's a perverter of what God's doing he's always taking what God's doing and perverting it so we believe it's the season of change he believes it's the season season of change and you see as his children change the norms and change the landmarks of society change genders change their figures with ink and piercings and disfigure themselves why is the only change of the body they're ever going to get and they try to have a change here because even they recognize it's the season of change the fullness of the end endend time condition has caught up with the prophecy and I say 2025 is going to be a great year not because of the evil but because I have some Divine appointments this year I've got some intersections where I'm going to meet predestinated moments I've got some appointments to see Jesus I've got predestinated moments that I'm going to step into intersections with eternity that I'm not going to miss and I'm not going to let one thing one Church trouble one person falling away one passage of time I'm not going to let anything make me miss my appointments I'm going to be locked in and focused because I know Satan's going to come and bring doubt and fear and disappointment and what are we going to do we're going to take it and we're going to cast it down because we can't get distracted now we're too close to the intersection signs say there's an intersection just ahead Church time had to catch up to Isaiah's prophecy but it did time had to catch up to Malachi 4 and it did time had to catch up to Revelation 10:7 but it did and I'm telling you right now that time is catching up to 1 Thessalonians 4:16 if you'll pull that up for me it may have been laid out there for thousands of years but now time has crawled right up to the beginning of this scripture and it says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord time is catching up to the promise we're right here on the verse of it oh the devil says you ain't going to make it you're not going to be there I got another one that time is catching up with Isaiah 14 and 15 yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit time is catching up to the word tick tock tick tock it's a countdown devil and it won't be long in time it's going to intersect with eternity and we're going home Hallelujah glory to God yes sir time is catching up to the word and soon all scoffing will end soon all doubters will be silenced and Satan will be destroyed forever but you you're about to catch back up to Eternity Hallelujah there's a marriage supper you're going to go to there's streets of gold you're going to walk on because your time on this time is about up and you're got to catch back up to Eternity once again glory to God I say it's going to be a great year because time is intersecting with eternity it's up to us to decide in this year what we're going to see you stand together with me will it be the fault will it be the failures are you going to be determined I'm going to see Jesus brother Brown says the devil never takes his Spirit off the Earth he takes his person his man God never takes his Spirit he takes his man God took Elijah and the spirit of Elijah come upon Elisha then following it it come down 800 years later on John the Baptist predicted again in the last days God took his son Jesus but the spirit come back we got the critics we got the Pharisees we got the Believers it's up to you to make the decision we would see Jesus Oh My 2025 it's G to be a good year see I'm planting seeds and I'm planning on harvesting those seeds prophet of God says the word is a seed but the seed won't grow unless it's placed in the right kind of ground no matter how much seed you got if you're afraid to sew it the seed will do you no good but listen to this every word of God is a seed Jesus said so and every promise of God will come to pass if you will receive it and don't doubt it can place it in your heart and believe it come from God and water it with faith it'll spring forth its kind he says now listen what he says here don't never forget this statement the prophet says that I'm a lock in I make this from my heart the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass he says you believe that amen if you'll take the right attitude that it's God's word and God is behind his word and the word is God it'll bring it to pass what it says well I'm saying it's going to be a great 2025 I'm saying we're going to see young people filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm saying we're going to see prodal return I'm saying we're going to see cancer healed we're going to see demons cast out we're going to see all the things that the word promises us because I'm planting that seed and I'm believing I'm not hoping so I'm expecting it to happen because the passage of time doesn't matter God's word cannot fail what are we going to have evening light Tabernacle well I'm looking for a Rapture oh I'm expecting a body change but if we carry we're going to have Revival we are going to have Revival like we've never had before Oh you say you can't have that you can't have it if you're not looking for it but I say I'm looking for it I'm looking for him to move here like never before we're going to have great outpourings of the spirit we're going to see prodal return we're going to have Divine healings we're going to be revived in the presence of all Mighty God I'm planting the seed I'm
