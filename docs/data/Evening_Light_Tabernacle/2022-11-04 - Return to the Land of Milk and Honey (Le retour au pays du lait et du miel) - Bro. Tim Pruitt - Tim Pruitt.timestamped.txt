[30:04] when the word was being spoken they
[30:08] received the word without even speaking
[30:10] the language
[30:15] amen and when we start worshiping God

[42:32] those around the world
[42:40] I'm listening in at this time not able
[42:44] to gather at this place
[42:46] but because you said that travel would
[42:49] vastly increase
[42:52] that our voice and our image can now be
[42:56] in many places around the world
[43:00] and today we are in speaking in many
[43:03] many different places
[43:06] where your children have assembled
[43:09] together
[43:10] I pray that you'll minister to them
[43:13] foreign
[44:44] this morning
[44:55] if you have found your place we'll start
[44:57] with Zechariah 4 and 1.
[45:03] and the angel that talked with me came
[45:06] again and wake me as a man that is
[45:09] awakened out of his sleep
[45:15] and said unto me what sea is thou and I
[45:19] said I have looked and behold the
[45:21] Candlestick all of gold with a bowl up
[45:24] on the top of it and his seven lamps
[45:26] they're on and seven pipes to the seven
[45:28] lamps which are upon the top thereof
[45:36] watches Chandelier
[45:41] and two olive trees buy it one upon the
[45:45] right side of the bowl and the other up
[45:47] on the left side thereof is
[45:52] so I answered and spake to the angel
[45:54] that talked with me saying what are
[45:57] these my Lord
[46:02] then the angel that talked with me
[46:04] answered and said unto me no it's not
[46:07] thou what these be and I said no my Lord
[46:14] is
[46:17] answered and spoken to me saying this is
[46:20] the word the Lord unto zeruba both
[46:22] saying not by might nor by power but by
[46:27] my spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[46:29] episodes
[46:40] before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a
[46:43] plane
[46:44] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[46:46] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[46:49] Grace unto it
[46:58] amen God bless you can be seated
[47:02] in zechariah's day the Jews would return
[47:05] him back to their homelands
[47:09] they had spent 70 years of Babylonian
[47:13] captivity
[47:15] and they have the task of rebuilding the
[47:18] torn walls of Jerusalem and restoring
[47:21] the temples
[47:25] so it was a time of restoration
[47:28] now there's a great parallel between the
[47:31] natural seed
[47:34] the nation of Israel and the Royal seed
[47:39] the bride of Christ
[47:40] and what God has done for the natural
[47:43] seeds
[47:45] in re-establishing them in their land
[47:50] he is doing the same for the Royal scene
[47:55] and neither can be blessed outside of
[47:58] their land
[48:01] even today
[48:10] because the nation of Israel to come and
[48:13] get 24 000 Jews
[48:16] and bring them back to the promises
[48:20] and nearly 200 000 planning to make
[48:23] their Aliyah yeah
[48:27] what is it it's God Gathering back the
[48:30] last few questions
[48:32] so they can receive their two prophets
[48:36] who will bring them back to their true
[48:38] atonement
[48:40] now brother Branham tells us in Feast of
[48:42] the trumpets
[48:47] their ministry will be the ministry of
[48:50] Elias and Moses
[48:53] calling Israel out of the Jewish
[48:56] Traditions
[48:58] just as the seventh angel called The
[49:01] Bride out of the
[49:06] and remember Moses and Elijah's to call
[49:09] Israel out of the old atonement of lamb
[49:11] and sheep and blood and goats and
[49:13] sacrifices
[49:18] to the Real Living Sacrifice the words
[49:24] and the seventh Angels message and the
[49:27] trumpet exactly the same
[49:30] message
[49:34] is to call the people the bride out of
[49:37] Pentecostal and World traditions
[49:43] the word Christ impersonated in his word
[49:46] among us may flesh us
[49:52] so in zachariah's day
[49:54] the Jews had returned to their land
[49:57] and they were getting ready for the
[50:00] headstones
[50:01] and to do this there was a visitation of
[50:04] the Angels
[50:07] who said that though there are mountains
[50:10] of impossibilities
[50:14] these mountains would be removed
[50:17] but it wouldn't be by man's Minds
[50:26] so The Headstone the finishing Stones
[50:31] would come by and be brought by a
[50:34] message
[50:38] shouting Grace Grace
[50:41] amazing abundant grace
[51:35] [Music]
[51:42] Islam
[52:39] we have barely tapped into what God has
[52:43] foreign
[53:46] amen
[53:51] [Music]
[54:10] the people of the book The purpose you
[54:12] leave has returned to the land of the
[54:14] Bible
[54:16] and Israel after 2 000 years
[54:19] it was now a nation
[54:22] celebrated nearly now nearly 75 years
[54:26] a man's lifetime
[54:31] now at the time of her struggle to
[54:34] become a nation
[54:36] the Dead Sea Scrolls were found
[54:41] and they it established the Jews as the
[54:44] people of the books
[54:47] and if they were the people of them
[54:50] then they were people of the land
[54:56] to the land amen
[55:01] amen amen so you see there were debates
[55:05] questions
[55:08] actually ever lived there
[55:33] and the the scriptures found in the Dead
[55:37] Sea scroll it is
[55:40] the Jews proved to the title to the land

[1:22:04] the Believers
[1:22:06] and it's open to us every resource
[1:22:11] and this has granted us
[1:22:14] untapped resource
[1:22:17] that Justice Israel had to conquer the
[1:22:20] land of it
[1:22:22] before them
[1:22:24] after seeing the walls of Jericho
[1:22:28] they opened
[1:22:30] it's only the beginning
[1:22:32] and the rest of the land
[1:22:35] before us
[1:22:40] oh people today
[1:22:42] are looking for the third pole
[1:22:44] and a quick short work
[1:22:47] what just how long is this quick short
[1:22:50] word
[1:22:53] three and a half years will it be seven
[1:22:56] years well brother Branham told us
[1:22:59] exactly how long ago
[1:23:01] it's not a year it's not a month it's an
[1:23:05] age he said this layout of cnasis
[1:23:09] of the quick work
[1:23:11] do you realize you are in the quick one
[1:23:14] yeah
[1:23:16] amen it's not just coming it's always
[1:23:20] been here
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:23] or the third phase
[1:23:27] was as he said in the anointed once at
[1:23:30] the end time
[1:23:32] the First full healing now second Paul
[1:23:36] prophesies
[1:23:41] and the Mysteries revealed there's no
[1:23:44] more higher order to reveal them
[1:23:47] he's on the way the prophet can be
[1:23:50] Vindicated
[1:23:52] and remember the third poem
[1:23:59] to reveal the hidden things
[1:25:00] all you say foreign
[1:25:51] thank you
[1:25:52] but for the most part
[1:25:54] it's been untapped measures
[1:26:00] it still lays there is
[1:26:02] untapped resources
[1:26:05] listen to what brothers
[1:26:08] well I was told in Danny Henry's
[1:26:11] prophecy
[1:26:13] and because he didn't go what's the
[1:26:16] denomination
[1:26:17] because that has chosen the narrative
[1:26:20] the harder way of what I produce thou
[1:26:23] has walked of thine ownership
[1:26:26] as he said in other words
[1:26:34] but I stayed with the words
[1:26:37] thou has picked the correct and precise
[1:26:40] decisions
[1:26:42] and this is my way and because of this
[1:26:47] momentous decision oh the decision a
[1:26:50] huge portion of Heaven
[1:26:55] you see because he would not go with
[1:26:57] denominations
[1:26:58] God entrusted him with a huge portion of
[1:27:02] Heaven
[1:27:05] now he explains Heaven is not portioned
[1:27:08] off to different portions to us
[1:27:12] is the Kingdom of Heaven that's within
[1:27:15] us yes
[1:27:20] he said that and he said Heaven is the
[1:27:23] Kingdom of Heaven that's within us
[1:27:25] what is it his portions this greater
[1:27:30] portion of Heaven would be the mysteries
[1:27:33] of God would be given to him
[1:27:38] would be taken off the bus
[1:27:41] to give us entrance
[1:27:46] to open up every promise
[1:27:53] so he said
[1:27:55] glorious decision now
[1:27:57] please yes is that which will give me
[1:28:02] and make to come to pass the tremendous
[1:29:03] was given amen
[1:29:38] might as well wake up to it this is the
[1:29:42] third phase the president was advised
[1:29:44] you have been seen in the vision
[1:29:48] Hallelujah I don't care if some of you
[1:29:51] are out of steps
[1:29:56] amen but because you are broken you will
[1:29:59] hear the prophets
[1:30:05] a man
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:31:05] that opened up the seven seas only said
[1:31:08] two and thus opened up the entire world
[1:31:11] it was all based now
[1:31:14] the third pole was based on description
[1:31:18] Mark 11 23. that speaks of untapped
[1:31:23] research
[1:31:25] that is given to the church
[1:31:27] it reveals
[1:31:35] on Mark 11 22.
[1:31:38] right yeah I always wondered about the
[1:31:42] scriptures he said I actually wondered
[1:31:45] well since that was given before the
[1:31:48] atonement
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:51] it wasn't in fact then after the
[1:31:54] atonement
[1:31:55] but he said sitting there God began to
[1:31:59] show him
[1:32:02] Mark 11 23. for verily I say unto you

[1:35:26] this it's like Joshua conquering
[1:35:31] Jericho must be first conquered
[1:35:36] up
[1:35:38] but once the walls are down the land is
[1:35:44] much more to be conquered

[1:38:09] possessed the land he said the word came
[1:38:12] in power as well so don't the word
[1:38:16] actually demonstrated
[1:38:18] the word preached actually demonstrated
[1:38:23] itself manifested like a flame and

[2:20:14] my process
[2:20:19] man
[2:20:22] I was in Jerusalem
[2:20:24] where this message came from actually
[2:20:28] I was in Jerusalem
[2:20:30] on the gold Dome of the mosque
[2:20:34] we heard the story
[2:20:36] we're in The Six Day War
[2:20:39] when Israel took possession of the
[2:20:42] Temple Mount composition
[2:20:44] and for the first time
[2:20:47] in 2000 years
[2:20:49] the Jews this Reef had access to the
[2:20:53] temples
[2:20:54] now this is where the Solomon's Temple
[2:20:57] says
[2:20:59] this is where they say that Abraham
[2:21:03] Allah
[2:21:04] you see this was their language
[2:21:07] but they was not able to go there
[2:21:14] even though they possess the other
[2:21:16] promises
[2:21:17] but now here

[2:21:57] Abraham was offered 18. unfair where the
[2:22:02] temple had been said are you with me
[2:22:06] but later the generals and the
[2:22:10] politicians became cowards became
[2:22:14] fearful because of world reactions
[2:22:18] and they ordered the soldiers to take
[2:22:21] the flag back down
[2:22:26] but no one would do it
[2:22:29] now
[2:22:31] the soldiers had been willing to risk
[2:22:34] their lives
[2:22:45] so the officers
[2:22:46] shot the flag down below
[2:22:57] how dare any of us
[2:22:59] to shoot down the banner
[2:23:02] when Jesus Christ gave his own life
[2:23:06] so that we can wave it in the effects
[2:23:13] to every holy Place
