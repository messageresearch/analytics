Nathan Erickson he's the big tall fella brother Ronnie's the one beside him a little shorter and I think brother Isaac somewhere in between but uh you know sister Bethany used to be a Lawson she's now a Hatfield she used to sing before her dad would preach and now she sings before her husbands preach her husband preaches so we have brother Isaac here tonight we found him to be a lovely young man and just a fine Spirit about him and and we had it on our hearts were there and began actually when we went to the um true word Tabernacle Youth Camp this year brother Aaron came back and began to talk about having these three coming Minister the New Years for us and so we put a plan into place and and here we are and we're looking forward to it amen that what God has in store for us and and I believe God's got something special amen for amen because he loves us and he cares for us and he he's got the best for us and I thank him for that and so we want to invite brother Isaac he'll be ministering tonight and brother Ronnie long tomorrow night and then brother Nathan will finish up Sunday and we're looking forward to all the things that God has in store for us so let's stand together as we invite brother Isaac to come and pull on the gift of God amen let's pull on the gift of God I know God will bless you tonight how many would say I have a need amen just real honest I have a need Lord I I got a specific and what's your Desiring not just you know we ask for hands but tonight let's let's raise a hand for a specific need because we serve a god who's mindful of that and able to minister to that and able to touch that whatever it may be it may be a family trouble maybe issues sickness whatever it may be situations in your own life God knows how to detail a service Amen to Go Right Down the Line Amen to to even repeat conversations or questions that you had in your heart or whatever it is God's able to touch you tonight all he's looking for is a touch of Faith how many of you say Lord let my hand be a touch of Faith to where to stop heaven and he turn around and say who touched me amen that's the kind of touch God's looking for tonight and so let's just turn to the word of the Lord and turn our hearts towards that let's sing that song I know the master of the Wind amen my board of life sails on me [Music] I have a friend [Music] oh I know I know to make your eyes [Music] [Applause] [Music] I know [Music] sometimes I saw like the sky above me [Music] affected Souls [Music] it may break before [Applause] [Music] I know praise [Music] [Applause] the sun again I know all the singing I know the master I mean those of Matthew tonight [Music] [Music] amen do you know him tonight amen isn't it good to serve a God that's the master of the wind the master of circumstances the master of all of our troubles and our trials amen it's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord tonight and we count it in honor and a privilege and certainly appreciate the opportunity our brother Tim and brother Aaron put together and it's not something that we take lightly brother Tim is a hero of ours and this message and and we certainly counted a great honor and privilege to stand behind this pulpit and bring greetings from Brother Ray Erickson and truer Tabernacle there in Bluffton Ohio and brother Wayne who you all know and love very well and certainly bring greetings and thankful to have my wife Bethany Hatfield with me I got in trouble the other day we were married for a while and I introduced her as Bethany Lawson and I'm still getting used to it but definitely great to have her with us and brother Ronnie and brother Nathan just an honor to stand with those soldiers of God so if you turn in your Bibles with me tonight to Joshua chapter one I know many of you may not know me at all and most of you don't know me as a minister but I just believe the same message that you do and brother Brandon talks about being seated together in Heavenly places he says what is that Heavenly places he says it's coolness it's Comfort it's feeling at home that's what brother Brandon said about Heavenly places and we definitely feel at home tonight and so we just thank the Lord and we want to read out of the Book of Joshua chapter 1. and then we're going to read a book of Psalms Joshua 1 verses 1 to 9. familiar passage Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan now and all this people under the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have had given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness in this Lebanon under the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people Thou shalt divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded the etern not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether so ever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein but then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether so ever thou goest I'm going to read to Psalms 42 you don't have to turn there verse 7 deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy water spouts all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me if we could take the title tonight it would be step into the commission it's for you it's for you may we bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just come before you Lord with just an all at your presence father and just how we've already felt an anointing in the building father we just felt you with us Lord as we've prepared for this service Lord as we've tried to put a thought together Lord we we felt Lord just your presence just sweep through in the music father and just anoint father the service and Lord we ask that that same anointing would just father just commune with us father through this service Lord that you just minister to hearts and needs father Lord I can never know father what the people are going through but Lord you know the very thoughts and intents of the heart father and you're the one they'll ordained this weekend father you ordained our very Footprints father where we would go and where we would come from and father we just commit our service into your hands we commit our voice into your hands Lord that your will would be accomplished in this meeting in the name of Jesus Christ we pray you may have your seeds we want to take a step into the commission and we want to read a quote to open it says now Joshua the new Warrior only two left now that ever left the promised land that was Joshua and Caleb now Joshua the new Commander to lead an army to step into the place where a great man like Moses stood it was no little task and he said I think of a minister today that's called of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stood what a command what a commission but he didn't leave it just as ministers He said Each that's called of God is commissioned to stand in the same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way you see you're stepping tonight into more than just the tracks of Tim Pruitt or Timothy Pruitt standing behind this Pulpit but stepping into the tracks of Jesus stepping into the tracks where Jesus stood under a commission to stay with the word to stay with the message but it's not just for me it's not the commission doesn't just apply to preachers but each of you that's called of God is commissioned to step into those same traps acts where Jesus stood but thank God he's not leaving it up to our ability but he said Joshua your commissioned to step into the tracks of Moses but I'm not just going to send you without any ability uh I'm going to send you with a deity with a power as I was with Moses who I will be with you I'm going to follow you I'm going to lead you into this battle I'm going to make the way clear before you I'm not leaving it up to your ability how he spoke to Moses and said Moses I'm going to come down and deliver my people they've been in bondage for 400 years I'm going to come down and I'm going to do a mighty work I'm going to bring them out of Egypt and I've heard the cries of my people and then he says come here Moses I'm going to send you to do it he said I have come down to deliver but I am sending you Moses to do the work you see both times that Moses did it it was the Flesh of Moses but brother Brown said one time Moses did it and one time God did it because when Moses went and tried to do it in his own ability he failed because it wasn't it was Moses's ability but the second time it was God working through Moses freeing to pass what he had planned to do all along he said I'm looking to fulfill my word Moses but I'm going to send you he said I'm going to make my word come to pass I'm ready to fulfill my promise but I need somebody to do it through you see he's not looking for Ability he's looking for prisoners someone that he can send the same way that He sent Jesus he said as I have as my father has sent me so send I you said how did he send him the one that sinned and went with them and went in I mean he said the one that sent you goes with you and in you to perform the very works that Jesus did he said I'm going to send you the same way I was sent I'm going to go in you and I'm going to go with you to fulfill the work you see the world has missed it by a thousand miles God can only work through Perfection so he couldn't work through the church the modern church because he couldn't stain himself in that way said I can only work through Perfection so I'm going to die for your sins and send back a Perfection on the day of Pentecost that I could work through a lowly humble people that I could fulfill my word through flesh and brother Brandon said that's where the secret lays that's where the world's missed it they failed to see that God put perfection in human flesh that he could work through it to fulfill his Commission in a bride body they're looking for a 60-foot Jesus to come out of the sky but he's picked up young men and young woman out of Louisiana to fulfill his commission he said I placed in you a Perfection that I can work through you there is where the secret lays although but he said you must have leadership to step right the Rich Young Ruler come to the end of the road and he said where do I step there's nowhere to put my step because he refused the leadership of God and chose the leadership of a church of a natural church but he said Moses when he come to the end of his Road he said he looked over and there was his leader The Rock and he stepped out onto the Rock and Angels took him away and said when the pyramids are gone when Egypt is gone Moses will still be immortal amongst men because he chose the leadership of God over the leadership of man and over the leadership of his church you must have leadership ship and that doesn't just apply to Moses but any man that's called will stay with the leadership of that word will walk in the rhythm of the word amen see we're not just commissioned to lay our hands on the sick but we're commissioned to stay with the word because many he said will come unto me in that day and say have not I cast out demons in your hands had not I done all this in your hands and they'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never even knew you because they didn't follow the leadership when they stepped into the commission but to his disciples his elect group he said you're going to do these things but before you go go up to Jerusalem and be endued with a power from on high I'm going to commission you but you got to follow the leadership and first you must go to Pentecost and receive a power that will be with you in that commission he said no man has a right to call himself a Christian or a preacher without that seal of the commission the confirmation that God is with you that God is leading you said stay until you see any man can go down to the 10 cent store and pick up a uniform in a badge and then the man can go and go go get a uniform he said that's not your identification but you must have the papers the seal the confirmation that God has sent you and then you'll have the confirmation the signs will follow you that believe he said stay until and then I'll write a book of Acts behind you and it won't be the Acts of the Apostles but it will be the acts of the Holy Spirit and the apostles because you followed leadership and God put a power in you to fulfill what he called you to do you see the question is if it's real the question isn't If the message is real the question isn't if the Rapture is real is is it for me that's the question that the devil will fight you with not if it's real but if it's for you you see we all know there's a commission we all know Mark 16 is still in action we all know the days of Miracles are still an accident brother Brandon said if the days of Miracles are passed the days of God are past and he said the Great Commission is just as much in force today as it was when it fell from the lips of Jesus Christ is that I can show you where the apostolic age began he said you show me where it ended we know that Pentecost began without an ending we know that is still we know that it's still just as much in force today as it was in the book of Acts but the question is is it for you is it for you he said but you're going to have to go and you're going to have to get the seal you're going to have to get the token and then you'll know it's for you say how do I know the tokens for me he said the promises to you and to your children is those that are far off even as the many as the Lord Our God shall call he said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness he said you would have been blessed just to hunger you that have a hunger tonight you that have a thirst you're blessed just to hunger and thirst but he said he didn't leave it there he said for they shall be filled that there's a tug on the inside of your heart that not just a hunger but it said You shall be filled like Rahab in the days of Joshua she said I've heard of this anointed Army in this Street walking State isn't enough for me this prostitute State isn't enough for me but she said I've heard of this Army and there's something in me tugging to go and meet this anointing that'll change my life and brother Branham said that that you applied the token it's for you if you fill in your heart there's something hugging it's for you you apply the token you see it's not about your goodness it's not about your ability but God's election in your life is what's pulling you to that new birth that's what's calling you to that it's not your ability it's God's goodness and election that's calling you to that you see if you have a hunger of God Brethren said the hunger of God in your soul it will go back to Pentecost to the beginning and find the real holy ghost that sets the heart of fire true hunger won't lead you to church joining to hunger won't lead you just to God's end of prophet true hunger will lead you to Pentecost and receive a satisfaction that satisfies the very desire of your soul that's where true hunger will lead you it will lead you to a reality that will change your life and make you a new creature in Christ Jesus hallelujah it's the Deep calling to the Deep you might not even have a scripture for it you might have not even come you might not have been born into this message you might have been born in denomination you didn't you didn't even know what this message was you didn't have no scriptures for it you didn't even you couldn't explain it you didn't know what it was but there was something in you hungering for something more it's the Deep calling to the Deep even if you don't have a scripture brother Brown said it's that creative power that's in The Believer that's strong you even if you didn't know anything about Divine Healing you know it's true even if you can't find it in the Bible because he said it's to create a power drawing you to it if there is he made the Earth for the tree there's something in you if there's a deep calling there must be a deed to respond even if you can't explain it you see coming into the house of God tonight it's not just a it's not a workup it's not an emotion brother Brandon said there's something about inspiration when it strikes there's something about inspiration when it strikes what you're longing for and when you strike that and tears begin to roll down your eyes while the minister is preaching he said what is it it's the feeding of the Holy Spirit to the flock when inspiration strikes he said the doctor came to me and said now you're just getting them excited he said Doctor you know you know better than that if you go out into a if you go into an alley it takes something to bring a scare it takes something to bring a fear you see a shadow or you hear a noise in that but spring is scared but he said in this case when you don't see anything and it's an excitement not exactly an excitement but a glorious feeling that raises the people up he said like I heard the little ladies a while ago singing the hymn the people were saying praise the Lord what does that it's a give way to an emotional emotion that's inside of you may I say it like this as David said when the Deep call is to the Deep at the noise of thy water spouts it's not a workup it's the Deep calling to the Deep one time brother Brandon was out in the wilderness and he was just rejoicing at the god that created the trees and the god that created the animals and it said he began to dance around that tree and he began to Rejoice he said they would have thought that Salvation Army was out there he said you can call it emotions but to me it was the Deep calling to the Deep something in you crying out to worship the Creator that you came from it's not an emotion it's not a custom it's not just coming to church to prove to your neighbor that you still have the victory it's something inside of you pulling you to the house of God to worship the Creator that formed you in your mother's womb before the foundation of the world oh don't just let the devil lie to you that this is just a is just a gathering it's something deeper than that inside of you drawing you to a reality Hallelujah what do you do brother man said the thing to do is when you come into service and you begin to feel that unbelief creep over the devil try to draw you down and you'll begin to pull back from the service and he said if that devil can put a question mark on your mind he's got you right there but he said what do you do he said you say you erase that question mark and say that's every bit true and it's for me then you're pulling from God why don't you turn to your neighbor right now and say it's for me it's for me and now you're starting to pull from God you see you say maybe it's not for me because I tried to I tried to pray for the Holy Ghost many times I've asked for healing many times but that doesn't mean it's not for you the thing to do is to press through that because that's the devil trying to keep you from your Victory it doesn't have one bit to do with whether or not it's for you in fact it's a sign probably that it is for you because the devil's trying to stop it but press through that into the reality and receive the promise that he gave you for the Holy Ghost for healing for everything you're going to need of press through that and let the word become your word brother Brian said you have something to do if I could have all these notes Here here but never preach it then then what Good's it going to do but that doesn't just apply to the preachers that you have something to do with let the word become your word and if you want to see a situation turn let the word drop into your heart and it'll turn that situation you let that word of healing drop into your heart it'll turn that situation you let that Word of Deliverance become your Word of Deliverance and it'll turn that situation oh it's a power in letting the word become personal to you you see our family very close to the Sacramento we're trying to have a baby one time and the situation looked very dire and the situation and looked very dark but one time a word caught hold and turned the situation and now they have a little baby girl and then another one on the way because they let the word become their word and you say well they had a vision over that but brother Brown said when you open the Bible every time you see a vision every time you open the Bible you may not have a vision by some man but you have a vision every time you open this Bible and you get a vision for your prodigals you get a vision for your healing and walk in that Vision until you walk into fulfillment and one of these days you'll be reading about prodigals returning and all sudden they'll come walking through your door because you have a vision by the word and you're walking in the vision and one of these days you're going to walk into fulfillment because you let that word become your word and drop Into the Heart of space Oh and now it's manifesting all around you and your walk in that fulfillment oh you'll be walking in your healing you'll be walking in your deliverance if you let that work become your word and keep walking keep walking in the vision and you're walking the Fulfillment Let It Drop In Your Heart oh it's not way far off it may take a few moments but keep walking in the commission and you'll be walking into fulfillment Hallelujah [Applause] what did the commission say let not this word depart from your mouth not let not this book of the law depart from your mouth he didn't say let it not depart from your hand he said let it not depart from your mouth Hallelujah that struck me brother Brandon sat hand and then he corrected not hand he said mouth you see somebody's going to teach it somebody's going to live it somebody's going to speak it it's not just coming to church and turning a page and reading about it and then going home somebody's going to let it get in their mouth and speak it and confess it until it becomes a reality in their lives let not that book of the law depart from your mouth stay with the commission stay with it is written you say oh so and so tried that and it didn't work for them but brother Branham said the Bible says some are foreordained to that condemnation some brother bran said the Bible said that they couldn't believe if they wanted to and some that is their type and some that is the place but that's not your confession that's not your place in this scripture you see the church natural couldn't receive the word because Eve natural was it was its type and they couldn't receive the word because they couldn't beat their tie brother Brandon said she can't beat her type you can't keep her from doing anything because she can't beat her type but if that could work in the negative how much more in the positive when the devil tells you you're never going to make a Rapture how could he tell you that when Enoch's your type and you can't beat your type if you're typing Enoch you can't miss the Rapture if you're typing Abraham you will not stop short of the promise because you can't beat your tag you can't keep them from nothing they've already been predestinated to fulfill the word and you can't beat your type young person don't let the devil beat you over the head with that you recognize who you are in the scripture and stand sure on that type that Enoch is my type Abraham's my type Rebecca's my type Sarah's my type already have my type and you can't beat your type press through it into the victory hallelu you can't beat it so press through it you see everyone's not gonna go with you but you can't beat your type it's for you it may not be for everyone but it's for me heartfelt religion may not be for everyone but it's for me the Rapture may not be for everyone but it is for me the Holy Ghost may not be for everyone but it is for me this message may not be for everyone but it is for me oh let that word become your word tonight of he said Joshua you're going to pass by Esau's mountain and there's going to be some that aren't going to go with you but he said your man your men have already tasted blood so they're going to want to try and go to fight with him but he said don't do that keep your eyes on the goal because because that's not your Mountain he said I've given these all this mountain for a possession but it's on the wrong side of the Jordan Joshua there's Jacob's mountain is on the other side of the river and you're meant to cross over your inheritance doesn't lay on this side of the river Joshua Esau's mountain is not for you and brother Branham said if all your deep is satisfied then then maybe that Mountain's for you but your inheritance to you who believe is on the other side of the river is that if all your deep is satisfied that's okay but as for me and my house there's something in me drawing I got across the Jordan I gotta cross the river there's a drawing he said a little healing service isn't good enough for me he said just going to church isn't good enough for me there's a deep calling to the Deep if I must cross the Jordan I must press to my mouth and I must press to my inheritance he said this doesn't belong to you your inheritance is beyond the river oh he said if Esau was predestinated to join up with you he would have so don't try to prosely Esau's Mount and he said you'll pick up their habits but as for me in my house you're across the river across to your inheritance across to where all things are possible oh that might not be everyone's type but that's your type you were not meant to stop at Esau's Mountain You Were Meant to cross over he said just settling down a sheep herding ain't enough for you just to go into some sort of business it isn't enough for you just to join the church and put your name on the book wasn't enough for you but there's a deep calling to the deep that won't be satisfied with anything less than Crossing into every promise oh yes you see you're going to pass some critics that say the days of Miracles are passed you're going to pass some critics Joshua out in the desert that are going to say that those things are gone that it's not for you that those things are ceased oh you're going to pass some that say Moses's message will not work it's not an absolute we can't put our faith in it we might be able to use it as reference material but Balaam he had good things to say too you're going to pass some critics of this message but Joshua was under commission stay with Moses his message Joshua was under a commission that said that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee it was commissioned to stay with the message no matter what come no matter what goal no matter what preacher said no matter what mother said he said your commissioned to stay with my message and brother Brandon said if you can read in that scripture something that Christ has ordained or commissioned us to do and because of some twisting around if someone would tell you that was for the disciples or someone else and then you don't hold on to that then Christ is not your absolute that person that led you out of the way is your absolute but if that word Christ still holds then he is your absolute so that struck my heart I said I wonder what we've been commissioned to do and then I know that that's my absolute regardless of what anyone says and we've been commissioned to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no matter what what teacher comes in and says that it's this way or it's that way we're under a commission we're under commission to raise the dead and cast out devils and lay our hands on the sick brother bran said that's just as vital as the preaching of the word in one spot just as vital as it is to preach the gospel we've been commissioned to preach the word in power and demonstration not in word only not in letter only but in power and demonstration the Bible said my speech and preaching was not with enticing the words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power that Peter on the day of Pentecost has so much power in the preaching of his word that while he spoke people could receive the Holy Ghost shows people could receive their healing because he was staying with the commission because it wasn't a dead letter he come out he said on Esau's Mountain they're building schools on Esau's Mountain there's building libraries and sending books but he said that's not what I've commissioned you to do I commissioned you to preach it in power and demonstration with signs and wonders following oh I'm getting somewhere with that you say half the churches half the churches will kick you out if you do that brother Brandon said you preached that you preached that Mark 16 and half the churches will kick you out but somewhere brother Tim in that other half there's a Rahab that's going to receive because you stepped into the commission there's a Rahab somewhere that's going to receive it and that's say that's for me that's for me someone's going to receive it because someone wasn't afraid to step in the commission and stay with the word there's an Elena butt somewhere that'll say that's for me and she'll slay a Goliath of cancer and it'll fall and her family will run behind her and say if it's for Mama it's for me too like David he killed that Goliath and the Israelites took courage and came behind him and said if it worked for them it'll work for me and brother Ben said you step in and say it's for me he said your whole family will come behind you and start start slaying Philistines because it isn't just for one it's for you who believe it's for you who have stepped into the commission but it doesn't just apply to preaching power and demonstration doesn't just apply to preaching I'm bringing it down to your level now it says your two took up and the things of the world you have to stay and see who loves to see you have to see Arthur Godfrey and go down and get Elvis Presley's records and play them and call yourselves Christians you are weighed in the balance and found wanting he said when you do go to church just a little sideline or something and don't worship he said in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men in vain he said it don't do no good to worship if you worship like that Jesus said it was in vain he said now look at him sitting there all the big religious people standing there tipping their glasses and having a fellowship and Jesus setting over in a corner with dirty feet oh God forgive me when I think of it Jesus with dirty feet brother Brandon said that's why I stepped away from the Baptist Church Hallelujah yes sir I believe my God ought to be worshiped in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost he said I don't believe in your cold formal Creeds he wants to be loved look at him setting over there and can't be loved because of the way he's treated and he said that's the same thing today you self-made Seminary chickens are pastors hat yourself out and try to place the dirty name of Holy Roller on the worship of Jesus no wonder your congregation don't stand taller it's the way you've treated them he said if you would have preached the Bible and the power of the resurrection of Christ Saints would be shouting in every Church in the Maricopa Valley he said it's not Jesus fault it's your fault and if you don't want the move of God in your church that's okay but don't blame my Jesus Jesus never preach that don't blame my Jesus I've been commissioned to stay with the word I've been commissioned to worship if you don't want dancing in your church that's okay but don't blame my Jesus don't blame brother Brandon brother Branham never taught that leave it off my brother Brandon and stay with the commission somebody's going to worship Him somebody's gonna stay with the commission somebody's going to leave all their ideas and stay with the Commission in worship I'm in spite of what what someone out there said someone's going to stay with the absolute commission and worship of Empower and demonstration it's not Jesus fault he said it's your fault but somebody's going to say don't blame the message oh the message doesn't do away with true worship the message introduced us to true worship there is now a bride that's in complete relationship that don't just worship them in spirit or truth they worship them in spirit and truth because the message introduced us to true worship is finally a bride that converts from the way he deserves to be worshiped in power and demonstration in spirit and in truth because a prophet wasn't afraid to stay with the commission oh he had to leave he had to leave the Baptist Church to do it but he stayed with the commission oh you say that was just for the Pentecostals well then why did the prophet have to leave denominations to worship God the way he deserved to be worshiped oh we're not worshiping under some sort of emotion but like David danced at the return of the word we're worshiping the return of the word we're worshiping to return to the word Hosanna to the one riding on the donkey he said oh dancing but we were commissioned in Psalms 150 praise him with the dance raise him on the timbrel let everything out of breath praise the Lord someone's going to stay with that absolute commission and not leave it Hallelujah oh and the critics are trying to get by Brother Graham said with some kind of ordination paper and not the true seal of the commission how could someone criticize it because they never got the true seal they just got some kind of ordination papers having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof Oh Brother Bear said Moses didn't just sympathize with those mud daubers he said he could have just looked out that window and sympathized with him but instead he chose to become one of them and brother Braham said I was in the Baptist Church and when I seen that was people with signs and wonders following though they were laughed at and called Holy Rollers he said it would have been easy to remain a Baptist preacher for I was one but I chose to become one of them at the Baptist Church to become one of them not just to sympathize with them but become one of those one of those Holy Rollers brother Branham said I heard it today you better be careful that you don't call someone a Holy Roller that's doing what you should have done he said you better be careful that you don't criticize someone that's doing what you should have been doing in the first place but someone's going to stay with it someone's going to realize it's for me if no one else does it it's for me I'm gonna step in and I'm going to give it my all because there's a deep calling into the deep that my God deserves to be worshiped correctly according to the commission oh you see Miriam danced because her accusers were drowned in the sea oh my accusers accusers accusers of past mistakes accusers of being just too emotional but one day those accusers were buried in the sea and Miriam had a victory dance and you say well that was just for sanctification but the Lord spoke to Joshua when he crossed over the George and said this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off of you this day Joshua have I rolled away your reproach you see if anyone can worship him it's this bride there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit those of you whose accusers have been buried you have a right to worship him like Jesus said to the woman where are thine accusers she said I have none Lord he said neither do I accuse you go and sin no more and I say to this bride where are thine accusers brother Branham an invisible Union declared you standing completely as you never sinned in the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed in your old book of divorcement is put away and instead absolutely out of existence you see you were deceived in it because inside of you the whole time was it Gene seed the real you you were deceived into it you were born a sinner but that was never the real you you were a gene seed from God or your accusations have been put in the sea of the forgetfulness oh you have a right to worship you're already wearing a wedding band of unmerited predestinated Grace little bride your accusers are buried in the sea you have a right tonight to lay aside every weight and the sin which says so easily beset you you see young man if you want to become a stronger young man you're going to have to learn to how to lift weights but if you want to become a stronger Christian young man you're going to have to learn how to lay them aside learn how to lay aside that condemnation learn how to lay aside those weights learn how to lay aside those feelings and take God's word in spite of it and press on brother bran said the church ought to have a commission like that go forward don't you stop just keep moving on press through the battles press through the complexes oh brother Brandon standing in the Gap he said he said it's just so easy to get a complex because brother Branham a prophet the seventh angel because people wouldn't hear his message he got a complex and he began to lose the feeling for the people and he said it's just so easy to get a complex here the seventh angel is telling you here he is telling you it's just so easy to get the complex but he asked the people he said I've asked that you would pray for me that God would restore I ask that you pray for me that he would get back to me what I lost out there in that complex and that's my prayer tonight for every complex that God would ReStore in your life what you lost out there in that complex that you could lay it aside that if someone criticized your worship and now you can barely lift your hands without feeling condemned may God restore what you lost out there in that complex if someone called you ugly or if someone made fun of you and made fun of your Christian walk and you begin to feel a complex throughout about what others think may God restore what you lost out there in that complex tonight maybe there's an elder here that got out in an inferiority complex somewhere and think that we don't need them or that that we don't have to have them to press on I rebuke that devil and pray God restored you the joy of your salvation and lets you know that we need you that we're helpless that we need you a Mighty Oak tree that we can rest under we can't press the battle without you we need our elders we need our young people I pray God restore what you lost in that complex out there that you can lay it aside bury it with the old gear and press on kill that thing don't dig up that old nature young people what the Lord did for you at Youth Camp what the Lord did for you in your special meetings here at church don't dig up that old man when God once sealed you he kicked that door shut don't try to open it again brother bran said don't get out on the tracks and try to open it if God sealed you you're sealed under the day of your Redemption don't try to dig up that old man bury your differences Bury Bury those things with the old year if God sealed your life don't try to open it oh I've been there but oh there's a piece and knowing what God does he does it well oh you don't have to break it to check it leave it alone leave it alone why couldn't you stop Joshua said any man that's a real queer Christian born again today no since he was a little kid or a little girl either there was something in you that hungered for God and you tried joining churches and everything else it wouldn't work what was it it was that word you was hunting for a filter and one day it flashed before your eyes Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and that satisfied The Taste he said anyone in here that's a Christian knows that something's been on you your whole life when you was a child you longed to serve God something beat in your heart it was God's election that's why you couldn't stop Joshua because Joshua was filtered for the commission that's why you couldn't stop Gideon's Army because there was some tests and he said if they're coward send them back and if they bow down to drink water send them back because they're used to bowing down to idols and we can't use them but Gideon's Army was filtered for the commission Elijah seven thousand was filtered for the commission Elijah said take courage you know Jezebel rejected your ministry Elijah this whole this whole multitudes rejected your ministry but brother Branham said the third poll went back for that seven thousand the second pool was to Jezebel but the third poll went back to that seven thousand you see God sent you a word to reveal to you who you were where you came from and where you're going though the multitudes only came for healing though the multitudes only came for brother branham's Healing Ministry there was something in you that wasn't just satisfied with that but you said there's a word there's a message there's a revelation that'll show me who I am and then come down and pick you up and filtered you for Rapture it filtered you for Resurrection it showed you who you were you passed the test because you were filtered through the first pole you were filtered through many things that's why you're still here when many others have left because there's a thinking filter that proves God's election in your life that won't settle for just a church joining it won't settle for anything short but it's filtered you through to fulfill the commission the natural Church couldn't go through that filter but God called out a bride that would pass through that filter to fulfill his commission he called out a bride that would receive this message you've been filtered for it because you wouldn't bow to Idols the Hebrew children once went into a fiery furnace and because they wouldn't bow they went into a furnace and brother Branham said that's what the devil will try to you do to you will try to burn you up with things that's what brother Branham said you've been prayed for and you'll get sicker it's the fiery furnace he's trying to burn you up with things he said he'll make you thought think you've lost your experience and brother bran said he's lying to you there's got to be a time when you've got to separate yourself between your feelings and your faith brother Brandon said that's the time it is tonight where you separate yourself between your feelings and your faith and say I will not bow to that devil I will not bow to that devil that's been lying to me you see you're like shamgar and there Comes A Time in the life where you realize that you don't have to take that beating anymore used to be when the devil told you you never were going to make it it would bother you for days but you're coming to a place where you realize you don't have to take the beating anymore you're recognizing who you are and he should have got you when you were walking in fear Lemuel he should have got you when you were walking in depression sister Rebecca because now you're walking in the commission and he can't get you anymore because you've stepped into something deeper than the lies of the devil you've been filtered for in a shame guards risen up and he said it's for me and I don't have to take the beating anymore because I know who I am I know the raptures for me I know I'm gonna make it I know the Holy Ghost is for me shamgar rise up and take back your possession you don't have to take the beating anymore you can press through it oh and say I know those lies aren't for me but every promise in the book is for me oh that's why you're still here that's why when you lay at bed at night and the devil tries to tell you this message isn't for you but there's something in you when many of them heard those lies and left there's something in you that said but to whom would I go where would I go this message alone is my shelter this message alone has the words of eternal life there was something in your filter that said but where would I go where would I go if I left that's why you're still here you've been filtered for the day you've been filtered for the commission that's why you're still here oh where would you go where else would you go that deep calling was pulling you to this message it wouldn't let you go anywhere else because there was a pull on the inside of you leading you to who you were before the foundation of the world world oh where would we go like Elisha came to Elijah and Elijah cast his mantle on Elisha and he said oh he said he cast his mantle and Elijah began to follow him and he said oh stay uh the Lord's calling me here and he's telling Elisha to stay but Elisha said no as my as my soul lives I will not let you out of my Society Elijah and he followed them to Dothan brother Branham said was justification he said he followed him to the school of the prophets which was sanctification but he followed him all the way to Jordan and one day he crossed over and he said oh if you see me when I go you can have what you asked for and he said I asked for a double portion of your spirit and one day that Chariot went up and that mantle came down and it was a perfect fit because elisho wasn't changed to fit it God didn't oh God didn't change the mantle to fit Elisha but God changed Elijah to fit the mantle he'd have to alter the message to fit your life you were already fitted before the foundation of the world this day for this message and Elisha stepped into that coat and it fit just right you see justification didn't cut it for him the school the prophets didn't cut it for him it didn't look right on them when you try on outfits before church tonight you go and say this doesn't look right this one doesn't look right this one doesn't look right but one one time you find one he said my that's very becoming of you that really looks good on you that's the one you're gonna wear that one and that was this message in your life you tried on justification you tried on sanctification you tried on depression and fear but one day you tried on this message and it fit just right and satisfied what you were missing your whole life it satisfied that calling on the inside of you and said this is who I am this is where I came from this is my reality this is my identification and it's becoming of you young people to wear the Rope of the message depression doesn't look good on you inside it doesn't look good on you but try on this message one time and it'll set you free from that thing and show you who you are show you where you came from try that message on it'll satisfy that deep calling I am a witness what God can do in your life if you step into the message and let it change you and transform you into who you were in God's mind before the foundation of the world try on the road that he likes to tried on and recognize who you are in Christ that will change you it'll set that filter just right and say this is it this is what I've been missing oh this is what I've been commissioned to do my whole life oh Elijah tried it on and it fit just right it was the same mantle that fell on the day of Pentecost and that's what fit your life and you can strike it for healing you can strike it like Elisha for deliverance for every promise you can strike that mantle oh and it'll work for you because you were tailored for it Hallelujah oh praise God you see you see Joshua wasn't the Forerunner Joshua was the inhabitor Moses Moses ran Joshua inhabited oh my Elijah ran Elisha inhabited and brother Branham was he was on this Earth he said I seen the message wasn't what what it is now he said I could see a group of people I see them splitting off from all these denominations and they have nowhere to go and he said when I laid the Cornerstone that morning on that church building God gave him a vision and he said from that time forward I purposed in my heart to make a place where the people could go to worship Him He said it ain't for me it's nothing for me he said God's calling me to do the work of an evangelist but he said I had something in my heart from that day to make some place for the people to Worship in and I don't believe that was just Brandon Tabernacle but I believe brother Brandon was here fulfilling something making a place for me and you to Worship in and he come and he preached to us God's chosen place of worship and introduced us to a living God he didn't just give us a tabernacle like this but he gave us a tabernacle that we could inhabit a place where we could worship when we were kicked out of every denomination of man's idea but you wouldn't bow to that Idol but God had a forerunner on the earth preparing a place for you to Worship in oh it was it was striking to me in the back office brother Tim was just talking about how the young children would gather around him when he was very breaking this ground I didn't tell him anything about this but he said oh he would tell the little kitties this isn't for me this is for you he said I may not see I may not see you grow up to fulfill I may not see you come to the age that I am but I'm coming to prepare a place for you it was building a place for the people to inhabit but it takes the people to step into the building and feel the pews and brother Branham came and preached us the message but somebody's got to inhabit God's chosen place of worship somebody's got to inhabit the Rapture somebody's got to inhabit the bride's Revival Somebody's gotta inhabit the rising of the sun somebody's got to inhabit leadership and Rapture somebody's got to step into the commission into the tracks that the Forerunner went before you somebody's got to step in and fulfill it you see he wasn't maybe going to see the finish of it all but he did it for you brother Brandon would step into the prayer line many times and he would come down and he said oh my shoes won't fit you my shoe's not the same size he would look at you and say well my jacket it fits you said no my jacket wouldn't fit him or I'd give it to him but he gave me something better than his shoes in his jacket he gave me a message that I could step into and find satisfaction he prepared a way that I could step in and find the joy of my life and find the Peace of my life he didn't give me natural clothes he gave me a message that would fit something that I could step into and wear every day of my life and be satisfied oh he preached the message and he said this is the light walking in it this is the light walking in it he showed me a place that I could inhabit and find refuge in the weary storm oh but somebody's going to step into the prophet's tracks of an invincible Army of a pure spotless bride oh many have seen God and brother Branham but only some that followed many have seen God in Moses but only some followed brother Branham said that Rich Young Ruler knew exactly who he was talking to but he didn't follow him but it wasn't in you to stay short of that there was something in you that seen it and you followed because it was in you that was what you were put here for oh and I know it's for me because I got the robe I got the robe and that's why I know it's for me because I didn't go through some back door to get it I came God's chosen way I came by God's leadership and got the robe and that's how I know it's for me that's how I know the message is for me that's how I know the Rapture is for me because I got the robe because I stepped into the commission oh Manny when Joshua crossed the Jordan he built a memorial of stones that others could walk by and see the mighty works of God in that day but I was reading about it the other day and it said to some it was just a pile of stones to some it was just Rubble but to the believer it was a memorial and that's what it is to you when you turn on the message it means something that it doesn't mean to your worldly maybe friends or neighbors they might listen to it and it's just a pile of rubble but when you turn it on it's a stone of remembrance of what God has done it's a stone of remembrance of what God can do you see when Martha was here and Lazarus was dead oh it was a dire situation but there was something in Martha as a as a as an elect of God brother Branham said Martha in that dire situation she had heard the story of the shunamite woman and how God had used Elijah to bring dead life back to baby boy and she heard the story and all of a sudden in Martha's dark situation she remembers this story about how God had used a lot Elijah to bring life back to a dead situation Martha remembered this story but it didn't just remain a story but brother bear said she had that Revelation that if God was with Elijah surely he's with his son and she recognized the potential of the word coming into her midst it wasn't just God sent a prophet but when the prophet leaves then it's all over with but Martha recognized the potential of the word coming into her midst that if God the same God that was with the prophet is with the word coming into her midst and that's what you do you recognize you stumble upon a stone of remembrance and it's not just a story of a shunamite woman but you're recognizing that the same God is in your midst today and every sermon that's being preached across your ears the Living God is speaking to your stones of remembrance that you can remember you can remember a god of of yesterday you see he's the same today and forever and I can imagine as Elisha put on that robe he remembered the stories of Elijah and what Elijah had done as Elisha begins to step into that robe he remembers he remembers what God had done through Elijah's ministry as he begins to step in that robe and brother bear said it's the blind Bartimaeus could trust him I can too if the woman with the blood issue could touch His Garment I can too for his open and willing his begging and accepting whosoever will let him come and drink from the Waters of Life freely he said what we need today is a Revival of that type A Revival of we can too a Revival that's what this message means to me it means I can too it means if it worked for brother Tim it'll work for me if it means if it worked for brother Ronnie and brother Nathan it'll work for me that's what this message means to me it means I can too because he's the same yesterday today and forever if it worked for brother Ron with stage four cancer it'll work for me if it worked for sister Elena it'll work for me because this message is a reality if it worked for brother branham's prayer line when a young man could bring shoes through and receive his ability to walk it'll work for Mariah Pruitt who can bring in some bobby pins and get her hair growed back because it's not a god of History it'll still work for you young people the same as it worked for your pastor the same as it worked for Mama and Daddy if you step into it it's not a history lesson it's a reality it's a Revival of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's a Revival of weekend too we can too it'll work for you young people oh you see it won't work for everyone though Pharaoh's Army tried to follow them through that Red Sea and they presumed that if the Believers the circumcised Israelites could walk through I said so can we and that was a dire mistake because they were a non-circumcised group and they couldn't follow the Believers through that Red Sea and that's what a reality you're realizing that you're going places that your enemy can't follow you that Revival won't work for your enemy but you step into that Holy Ghost he won't be able to follow you there he won't be able to follow you into the Rapture you won't be able to follow you into that place where all things are possible for you you might be able to follow you so far but step into that place where that enemy can't follow you press through that Red Sea press into that Promised Land you won't be able to follow you there you'll be dancing to victory march and your enemy will be drowned behind you he can't follow that Revival it's not for him but it's for you Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is for you the devil can't follow you there but Preston where he can't follow you where those lies no longer keep you up at night press through into the place oh where that enemy can no longer told you you've crossed the place and no return you've pressed into a reality and all things are possible the sick can be healed the dead can be raised the lane can walk you press through into place where that devil cannot follow you oh you're going places young people you're going to Place Church of the Living God that the devil can't follow you and one day you'll go on a Rapture and he'll be stuck here to go through a lake of fire because he can't follow you through that place you've been filtered for the day you've been filtered to go places that the enemy can't follow you and holy left behind while you're in the victory Marsh while you're dancing like Mary and while you're dancing like Joshua oh that enemy will be left behind he can't follow you there he's been left behind oh he's been left behind in his own unbelief oh and his own limited his own limited capacity but you you're an eagle that can soar above that where buzzards can't follow you he said oh he said if they would have put that wine in that it would blow it up because it was it was he couldn't put that wine in that old bottle oh but you've been you've been built to compress through that you've had a new spirit you've received a reality that'll take you places where he can't follow you oh you might get discouraged but just keep pressing just keep walking you may feel like he's there I don't have the quote in front of me brother I think said if you if he hasn't got you yet you're still a few steps ahead of him and just keep walking just keep walking young people brother Brandon one time landed and I believe it was Memphis in in his flight I think was delayed until he got off the plane and he went and I think he maybe got a sandwich and he just began to walk and all of a sudden the Lord spoke to him and said go this way go this way and he was leading him to an old uh an old colored woman that was going to Touch the Hem of His Garment and God was leading the prophet there but he didn't understand it all in that moment but the spirit of the Lord would speak to him just keep walking just keep walking he said oh the plane's going to take off I'm gonna miss it he got a call it's going to leave at six o'clock he said oh I'm going to miss my plane but the spirit of the Lord would just speak just keep walking and he began to sing that song or brother Timothy saying I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I want to begin to sing that old Victory song and he just began to walk with the Lord and that's where you want to receive Victory you stop worrying about the plane and when it's going to take off and just keep walking with the Lord you get your eyes off the conditions and just keep walking with the Lord I think that's for this new year just get your eyes off the conditions and just keep walking just keep walking and it is written just keep walking and just saith the Lord Brother man said if you obey the word what's coming next the promise is what's coming next if you've obeyed the word for healing for the Holy Ghost for a Rapture the promise is coming next so just keep walking stop worrying about the conditions stop worrying about how far out your prodigal is and just keep walking in the promise until it's fulfilled stop worrying about how sick you are and how impossible it seems to make it and just keep walking if you've obeyed the word the promise is coming don't worry just keep walking in the promise walking in the commission remember who you're walking with you're walking with one that Enoch walked with your walking with the one that Joshua met the captain of the Lord the captain of the host you're walking with the one that brother Brandon walked with when he turned back young and that virgin Timber and his wife was there with them and all of a sudden he was a young man you're walking with a god of the impossible remember who you're walking with it's not a history lesson remember you're walking with the same one that Moses walked with that Joshua walked with you see I don't know how many in here like to read but I used to read quite a bit when I was younger and sometimes you're reading a book and you come down and when a chapter ends the words don't always go to the end of the page sometimes there's a space a blank space and when you're coming to the end of that book you're coming to where those things are beginning to come to Climax and you see those words stop at the end of the page and you think oh my is this the end of the book is this the end of the book I don't understand everything yet what if this is the last chapter and you turn that page and all of a sudden there's another chapter and you feel such a relief you say oh my it's all going to make sense now there's another chapter where it's all going to come together and in literature there's something called a day Newman it's those final events those final scenes in literature where the where all the loose tens are tied together it's that it's that final part of a script where all those loose ends come together and you're walking in that day Numan you're walking in that place where the loose sins are being tied together that's what this message did it tied the loose sins of teachers over the years together and gave us an answer it gave us something that made sense it gave us something that fulfilled what we've been looking for in you and the things of your life and the things that you don't understand and you thought the world would never go on you thought you would die in that condition you thought you would never make it you thought you would die in that depression or that Darkness but all of a sudden you flip the page and there's another chapter there written over your life the chapter of this message that revealed to you who you were the chapter that made it all make sense in your life oh you see brother Brandon was preaching he was preaching he was preaching out the greatest battle ever fought and there's a little girl that he refers to many times throughout that message and he comes to the end he said but Lord I'm so glad that there's another chapter written we can turn another page and in this page we see the great physician come in we're calling him for counsel this morning oh Georgia Carter was just a few pounds 30 some pounds but one day the Lord spoke to the prophet and said go by the way of Carter's and to open up another chapter in her life a chapter of Health a chapter of Life Florence Nightingale was only about 40 pounds whether Brandon said she was just a pile of bones but one day the prophet came by her way and crossed paths with Florence Nightingale and he prayed for her and she held his hand he said brother Brandon have brother Brandon pray that I might die but brother Branham couldn't pray that over her life but he prayed for her her and all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord spoke and said thus saith the Lord you'll not die but you're going to live Florence Nightingale in another chapter opened over her life a chapter that that tied the loose ends together and gave her a health and some of you brother William you went to Camp one year you were Desiring the Holy Ghost and maybe you didn't know it was for you but all of a sudden another chapter opened up and it gave you what you were looking for the whole time isn't that right brother Joseph Adams one day you went to camp and you thought maybe it wasn't for you that that that those around you were receiving it but it wasn't for you but I'll send another chapter opened up over your life and now you know what it's all about now it's all starting to make sense those loose ends are starting to tie together all the things that you never understood when is my product going to return when am I going to get the Holy Ghost it looks like the end is right here but all of a sudden God flips over the page and there's a chapter of healing there's a chapter of Deliverance there's a chapter of prodigals returning is a chapter where you the gene seed of God are pulled into the fulfilled helmet pulled into the body of Christ that the Rapture can go it can't go without everyone he will not lose the one of his don't wait oh it may look like the end but flip the page and watch it all make sense watch those loose ends tied together watch you don't watch that chapter of your life begin to bring all all the fears and all the darkness begins to come together and you realize who you are you realize why you went through those things you realize your identity in Christ in that final chapter when it all begins to come together all those loose ends in your life begin to tie together and all of a sudden it all makes sense God was guiding you the whole way and he was going to tie it together and the thing about a day Newman is that when you come to the end it says one of the most important pieces since this is the ending the audience has been waiting for throughout the story often this is the part readers must remember from the story and which lingers in the minds long after they finish reading or watching we're living in an hour where things are taking place in your life that you're going to remember when we're on the other side of Glory when we're fellowshipping when we're on that supper table things that happen in that final chapter you're going to remember on the other side the great things that God has done in your life how he picked you up out of this age how we saved you how he elected you how he's how he kept faithful to you every time how he performed every promise how he performed miracles in your life and in your church oh when we get to the other side that final chapter will still ring through your ears oh of the mighty things that God has done done you see brother Branham came to a place where the angel commissioned them said the commission was pray for the sick he said the question was insufficient to do it but what spoke back was for this cause you were born this is the means of your peculiar birth in life that you are to pray for the sick he couldn't understand it because his father was a drunkard because if he would try to drink a bottle of alcohol a voice would come and would keep him from doing it and he would be called a for it he didn't understand it because he would walk down the street and he would get made fun of not because of anything he had done because the reputation of his family was so bad that he couldn't walk down the street without getting made fun of now who would go to school and he wouldn't even have to have it he couldn't even have a shirt he'd have to wear a coat just so he wouldn't be embarrassed and he'd have to sit around that fireplace and burn up because he didn't have a shirt and he thought my how could I fulfill this commission I have all these insufficiencies but a voice ran back and said for this cause you were born this is the means of your peculiar and birth in life because I've called you to be the seventh angel messenger because I've called you to fulfill Malachi 4 because I've called you to fulfill this this is the means of your peculiar birth and life in us we come into this day and we come in this age and we've been commissioned to live in the darkest days there is we've been commissioned to fulfill the very Ministry of Jesus Christ in a bride body we've been commissioned a Rapture but the question in your mind is insufficient for the job I have all these problems I have all these mistakes I was born in a broken family I can't even talk right I can't even make friends I have all these complexes I have all these fears and I have all these complexes in these depressions I have all these things and the question in your mind is insufficient for the job but The Voice rings back and says this is the means of your peculiar birth in life this is why you can never fit in with others this is why you always fell out of place this is why there was something and you're always drawing you something more this is what this explains that filter in your life this explains that deep calling to the deep in your life while you were always miserable in the world why you're always miserable outside and just a religious spirit this explains that peculiar birth in life because you were called for a commission this is it because you've been commissioned and you're sufficient to fulfill this is the means of your peculiar birth in life this is the means of all why you're an oddball why you don't fit in with the world why you couldn't fit in with that denomination because you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light you see Jesus was born for a purpose and he was the only one that could fulfill it but he had to make the decision in the garden am I willing to do the will of God because a voice could come back brother Brandon said it might have been like this let's think maybe it was I can hear him say son do you desire to go to Calvary there's a band waiting for you there's persecution there's death and murder laying in the way there's exposure of your own body they'll strip the clothes off of you they'll beat you into pulp they'll pull a crown of thorns over your head and you'll die screaming for Mercy should you go on skipping down a little bit brother Brian says Jesus when you looked up into the face of the father he said it's not my will it's yours be done what a decision the decision anchored and swept the world and still comes tonight to every penitent Soul not my will but thine be done because he had a people in mind he said devil you've held fears and chills over the people long enough you've held them long enough I'm gonna go because I've got a people in mind that need this they need this blood that I could work through them that I could fulfill their part of the word through them that I could give them a blood that would cover them and he knew he said you've helped you've fooled people long enough get back in there where you belong he said you can't keep them any longer there will be people who will believe me you can't bind them up with sickness you can't bind them up with fear they will believe Hallelujah they knew there was a Rahab that was going to be out there to receive it and he stepped in he stepped to the pain he stepped through the fear I think of brother Ron how the Lord would speak to him and say and say if you trust me I'll use you like never before What a Mighty commission that was but he had a he had a trust he had to step into a place to trust Lord I surrender to your commission I surrender to what you have for my life though it's hard though it's not easy though I go through hardships and trials I'll surrender to the commission oh and brother Brandon said that's why he can walk to the platform he said I do enough in an hour to go to hell he said I've done enough and to die in an hour I'm a sinner to begin with he said don't you fear I'm looking who's told me don't you fear stand there for this cause you were born I raised you up for this purpose then all devils in hell can't make me move I'm standing there on Christ that Solid Rock oh if you step into that Commission according to the blueprint of the word you're sufficient for the job you're sufficient to go all the way you're sufficient for Rapture and this is the means of your peculiar birth in life if the musicians come and with the story the song leader comes brother Matt Morse and Arkansas tells a story one time he was in Indiana eating lunch with a group of people a group of brothers and they begin to tell testimonies about brother Branham they just begin to tell testimonies about all the things the Lord has done and testimonies about this message and a man walked up and said you wouldn't happen to be talking about William Brandon would you and he said yeah actually that's exactly what we're talking about he said okay okay I wondered he said let me tell you this story they only knew him as William they didn't even know him as a preacher they knew him as an as an electrician is it my grandma and my grandparents they owned a store downtown here in Indiana and William our brother Brandon would come he would come to the store and he would he would play checkers and and he would get a cold drink on a hot day or a hot drink on a cold day and he would just go in there and just fell a ship with her family he said one day he come to my grandma and he said would you please take me to your boy would you please take me to your boy you see the boy had polio and they said sure you know yeah he's upstairs and and that would be great for you to meet him I'll be glad to take you to him and so she took him upstairs and he said well thank you I appreciate that can I have a few minutes alone with the Lord just to pray about this and said well sure you know that seems a little odd maybe she didn't understand it but sure so brother Brandon stay up there and prayed for a while and he'd come back downstairs and he said thank you I appreciate that and I want you to do a favor for me he said I want you to set another place setting at the table for tonight's dinner and she said oh all right I'll be happy to do that and she starts to get excited and she her husband's coming home from work and says you know what something he said uh uh Williams coming back for dinner tonight brother branham's coming to visit us for dinner and so that's odd he didn't tell me anything about it he said yeah well he told me to set another place tubble at the setting and so she sets it and she gets excited and they sit down and they're waiting for that company and they just begin to gather on the table and hold hands and pray and she says he begins to start praying and thanking the Lord for all that he had done in their lives it began to start thanking the lord for what he had done in their family while his boy sitting up there with polio he begins to start thanking the Lord for all their blessings and while they're praying all sudden they hear footsteps coming down the stairs and that boy who had been in that crippled condition for the first time takes his place at that table and they just begin to thank the Lord and I think my his condition was so so dark his condition was so helpless I imagine he laid up there sometimes in that bed and heard his parents talking he thought I wonder if I'll ever be a part of what they're talking about I wonder if I'll ever be a part of their daily plans I wonder if I'll always be in this condition in this prison what felt like a prison this prison of fear this prison of Darkness this prison of of depression this this prison of helpless conditions I wonder if I'll always be here Mom was downstairs at the table talking about the Holy Ghost Daddy's down there talking about the rep Rapture and I wonder if that's for me I wonder if I'll ever be able to join them at that table and realize that it's for me I wonder if I'll always be stuck in this cage of confusion and fear but all of a sudden one day a man come by his way and he crossed paths with something that could change everything he crossed paths with the reality and like that eagle that's in that cage beating his brains out brother Brown said you're helpless just as helpless as you can be unless somebody puts forth his hands and opens the cage he said I'll tell you tonight Jesus Christ has done that and calling you open the cage to let you out this young man was in the helpless condition one day there came a call that opened the cage and he come down those stairs and Mama sitting at that table and Daddy's sitting at that table and pastors sitting at that table and all these years he's wondering if it's for him and there's another empty chair there and he said who's that for oh that's for you it's for you that tugging in his heart will I ever be able to join him at that table will this Rapture will I ever know if it's for me well this holy ghost ever before me but God's calling on your life open that cage to let you out and you have a right to walk down and take your place at the table it's for you tonight God bless you God bless you you all know [Music] I'm glad you see [Music] a hopeless face let me
