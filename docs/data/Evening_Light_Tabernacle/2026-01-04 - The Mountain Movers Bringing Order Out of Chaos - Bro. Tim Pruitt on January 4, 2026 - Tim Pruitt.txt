A familiar road I've walked before, just as dark as it was then. But this time, something's different. God's peace is deep inside. His strength is coming over me, and I'm understanding why. I know him better now. than I ever had before. I know him better now. And I've never loved him more. There were times I've walked this merry road and I know I've had my doubts. But today my faith is strong. I know him better now. So I'll walk with sense of grace. Through tomorrow circumstance in the depths of sorrow I'll embrace with a new found faith I have.

I know him better now. &gt;&gt; So much better now. and I never loved him more. &gt;&gt; There were times I was very my doubt. But today my faith is strong.

You can start out this new year &gt;&gt; saying it is well. &gt;&gt; All is well. Amen. We have seeing things where our faith has become in sight. Miracles are happening among us. Deliverance is taking place. prodals returning home. The children of God rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Healing's taking place. &gt;&gt; God is still God. And he's here to make real his word to you today. And in this new year to come, he's here to manifest himself in a greater way because we're truly in the end time. We're here in the fulfillment of prophecy where the word of God is being made manifest in this hour, in this time. If you got a need today, why don't you lift a hand to God and say, "Lord, don't pass me by. Come speak to me." Lord Jesus, as we bow before thy throne of grace, we want to thank you for love, mercy, and grace, which is what we see when we look upon you. Not an avenging judge, not an angry God, but a compassionate, loving Savior whose arms are stretched out, whose mercy, oh God, we cannot fathom, whose grace is unsearchable. Oh God, today we ask that you'll speak to our hearts. Reveal yourself, Lord, through the word. May, oh God, I be a vehicle today through which your voice can be heard as you would say, Lord, through the messenger of this age that the voice of God would be in the ministry. and Lord, ministers, men of God that are sent of God. For you didn't choose the wind, the waves, the the stars, the sun, the moon to preach the gospel, but you chose men. So Lord, let us be heralds of the great truth today. And may your word, Lord, just go forth in power. May it break the the bonds, the bounds of of man. And Lord, the hindrances that would be there, the chains would drop off. Unbelief leave, Lord. Oh God, that the evil spirits that have had people bound, oh God, that they can rise up knowing I'm delivered, I pray, dear God, that you'll bless your people today, Lord, the hands that was lifted to you, Lord, signifying the need, I ask that you'll minister to that soul today if necessary to even call us out, Lord, of our of the subject we're speaking on and cause us to step out, Lord, in under the inspiration and discern the heart and speak directly to the need. Father, we commit ourselves to you. Now, Lord, I pray that this today won't be mechanical, but it'll be the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and that you'll give ears to hear, Lord, in this congregation and those around the world. Lord, that you'll lift our spirits, oh God, and our faith now to believe the word of promise. For the promise is unto us, to our children, to them that are far off, an apostolic age that has never ceased. And we are in it at this time, in this moment, with the same God, the same manifestations, the same glory. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. If you'll turn with me to Genesis chapter 1, we'll read from verse one. Genesis chapter 1 and verse one. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. I think it's very appropriate that we start here in the very first chapter in the first verse of the Bible here at our first service this this new year's as we just look in a time of reflecting about the beginning there and also the beginnings of a new year and you know today I I want to speak on a subject um that I've never spoke on before but something that I want to impart upon you today and we see how the Holy Spirit will direct it but I want to speak on bringing order out of chaos. &gt;&gt; It was in the quiet hours of the early morning sometimes last week probably about Monday or Tuesday that I I was I was suddenly awakened. I was caught between two worlds. My my body lay still in the natural, resting on the bed, but my spirit was aware of another realm. And in that place of awakening there, I I heard with clarity these words spoken very plainly, bringing order out of chaos. And I was immediately aware that this phrase had been used before. I know brother Biscll preached a message with that title, though I've never heard the sermon myself. Honestly, I don't know what he preached in that service or how that he was directed to minister that. Yet, what God impressed upon me was not a borrowed thought, but a living truth. It was one that had already proven itself by the power of God. Uh because I was reminded of the testimony of brother Ron Spencer that he shared when when I he heard brother Bisco preach this using this title in North Carolina. And um at that time he was recovering from a devastating fire. As you know this has been about 17 18 years ago now. His lungs had been badly scarred by the smoke and the heat. His his breathing was was very limited. His strength was diminished and and his ministry was severely affected. His body was in chaos &gt;&gt; and and um his future really even at that moment as a minister it looked uncertain because you have to have breath to be able to preach. And you know, he was still trying to minister and labor under that because as the Bible said, the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. &gt;&gt; And at that service, while listening to brother Biscll preach that message of bringing order out of chaos, there was faith that rose in his heart. And as the word was preached, he stood to his feet. He lifted his hands toward heaven. And by faith, he just breathed in healing from the spirit of God. And at that moment, the the almighty God met him and his lungs were restored and his strength was returned. And what the doctors could not repair, the Holy Ghost did it instantly. &gt;&gt; You see, God literally brought order out of chaos. &gt;&gt; And as you know, uh, Brother Ron has been in this journey with cancer. And I think now this will be entered into his sixth year where that you know that he has had to deal now with um cancer being having fourth stage lung cancer then went to his brain and and other parts of the body. And uh throughout this journey I've seen God do this again and again. &gt;&gt; Amen. take moments where it was chaos &gt;&gt; and turn it into divine order. &gt;&gt; And it was like that morning that I was at brother Ron's home when I was awakened and I was hearing this song that was sung from a heavenly dimension. We shall see miracles. And when God does miracles, it's always God stepping into chaos &gt;&gt; and bringing order. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I saw it happen, you know, again when he was late dying and the doctors was about to harvest his order his organs after being burned in a fire. And I saw it again when brother Donnie and I prayed with him about the first news of cancer. And that's where I was that morning when I heard it from the other dimension. We shall see miracles. And we have certainly seen miracles. And I I saw there in that moment though that the chaos of fear left him and order was restored. I I saw this happen again when he was diagnosed with cancer in his eyes and they were about to take out one of his eyes and treat the other with chemo in hopes to save his life. I stood there, brother Donnie and I met him there again and and uh we both ministered there. I I preached there a sermon called the hour has come because we were at a very critical crucial hour. And you know those those hours come you know it may be your hour &gt;&gt; your day your visitation even this morning &gt;&gt; where that God will step in to your chaos &gt;&gt; and bring order in your life. But in that crucial hour where that chaos had come, where he was about to lose an eye, that that God stepped into that chaos and and the cancer was gone. The eye was clear. And and I'll tell you, these things were not emotional excitement. It was not even the power of suggestion. It was the power of faith that was responding to the spoken word. I want you to know the word has power &gt;&gt; and the word still works. &gt;&gt; And the scripture said that faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. And again, he sent his word and healed them. That's Psalms 107:20. And so, YOU KNOW, MIRACLES DON'T COME FROM HUMAN EFFORTS. It comes from believing the promise of God. And this was a a living DEMONSTRATION THAT WHEN GOD SPEAKS INTO DISORDER, whether in creation or in a body or into a life, I don't care what kind of chaos it is. &gt;&gt; Chaos must yield. &gt;&gt; For with God, nothing shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; AND I I WANT YOU TO LOOK TODAY AT WHATEVER you are facing or whatever situation that you are in. Maybe the chaos that is in your life or in your family or in your finances or in your situations, whatever it would be, I want you to look at it and and look at it with with this kind of faith. With God, nothing shall be impossible. And what I realized the other day in that early moment movement was this, that the same God who hovered over the dark waters in Genesis and spoke light into existence is the one who is still speaking today. And as I lay there upon the bed, as this AS THIS THOUGHT CAME TO ME, the scriptures began to just kind of unfold to me and and I got up quickly and begin to write them down. And today I want to convey to you the things that God has has laid upon my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because now it won't be laid just upon my heart. For it is not for me alone, but is for you. is going to be laid there upon you for you to decide what you want done with the chaos in your life. &gt;&gt; And this this is of course as we look AND WE WENT BACK TO THE BOOK OF GENESIS, I want to even go beyond the beginning and I want to say before time, before space, BEFORE SOUND ITSELF, GOD dwelt alone. &gt;&gt; He is the I am God. He's not just an I was or I will be, but a present tense God. &gt;&gt; AND ALTHOUGH HE IS I was because he was in our past. &gt;&gt; And though he will be because he is in our future, &gt;&gt; but he is he wants you to know that he IS THE I AM GOD THAT IS PRESENT &gt;&gt; THAT IS READY TO BRING order into your life. And and so you SEE WHEN WHEN GOD DWELT ALONE AND THERE WAS NO UNIVERSE HUMMING AND THERE WAS NO ANGELS SINGING AND THERE WAS NO STARS BURNING only stillness, absolute silence. God was there. He existed in the fullness of his eternal being. HE WAS COMPLETE AND SELF-SUFFICIENT. YET HE WAS alone in his own thoughts. AND THOSE THOUGHTS WERE NOT IDLE THOUGHTS, &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE HIS ATTRIBUTES. &gt;&gt; THOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALIVE. THEY WERE POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY WERE POTENTIALLY THE WORD THAT HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMED. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE POTENTIALLY SONS OF GOD WHO HAD NOT YET BEEN MADE MANIFEST. BUT in him, his thoughts were eternal. and they were alive and they were POWERFUL AND THEY WERE MOVING in his thoughts as he would even see you here in time as the SONS OF GOD SHOUTING together for joy over the victory you have in Christ. &gt;&gt; SO BEFORE THE BEGINNING you see he was and before the beginning you existed in his mind. Really church, YOU ARE NOT A TEMPORAL BEING. You have always been. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE YOU EXISTED FIRST OF ALL IN HIS THINKING IN HIS ETERNAL PLAN. SO THEREFORE, THERE IS AN ETERNAL QUALITY TO GOD'S ELECT TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see, YOU YOU WERE NO AT NOT AT THAT TIME A TANGIBLE BEING, BUT YOU WERE REAL BECAUSE GOD'S THOUGHTS ARE REAL. YOU WERE ETERNAL BECAUSE GOD'S THOUGHTS ARE ETERNAL. BUT GOD WANTED YOU MORE THAN AN attribute in himself. HE WANTED YOU EXPRESSED into a form that he could love, THAT HE COULD TOUCH. AMEN. THAT HE could that he could manifest himself to. So God chose not to remain alone &gt;&gt; and he'll never be alone again. Amen. &gt;&gt; For God is love and love desires expression. &gt;&gt; AND LIFE LONGS TO reproduce itself. &gt;&gt; AND SO CREATION BEGAN. IT DIDN'T BEGIN WITH CHAOS, BUT IT BEGAN WITH GOD REVEALING HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AND THE STILLNESS WAS BROKEN WHEN GOD FORMED HIMSELF INTO A LIGHT, A LITTLE HALO of light, a pillar of fire. For God said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; And now the thoughts that were in God became released into another form. As it began to move into theophonyic form and from theophonyic form, it would become manifested in flesh. &gt;&gt; So creation began with God speaking. AND THIS AND THEN BECAUSE OF HIM SPEAKING IT BROUGHT ILLUMINATION AND THAT WAS MORE THAN A PHYSICAL ILLUMINATION. IT WAS FIRST THE OUTWARD IT WAS THE FIRST OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF ETERNAL GOD as John tells us in him was life &gt;&gt; AND THAT LIFE WAS THE LIGHT OF MEN &gt;&gt; AND GOD STEPPED OUT OF SILENCE AND into revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; This was the beginning. This was the logos. For in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. And when the word came forth from God, it be to CREATE BECAUSE THE WORD IS LIFE AND LIFE BEGINS. SO YOU SEE IT COULD NOT IT COULD NOT JUST PRODUCE ITSELF WITHOUT CREATION BECAUSE IT IS LIFE AND LIFE PRODUCES ITS OWN SELF &gt;&gt; kind after kind and creation would be you know how it began with God speaking &gt;&gt; Amen. THE FIRST THING OF CREATION was the voice of God. God speaking out and the universe as it was born. It was not born quietly. No. No. Psalms 33:6 says, "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and THE HOST OF THEM BY THE BREATH of his mouth. AND ANGELS WERE CREATED THEN TO INHABIT THAT NEWLY SPOKEN REALM. AND THEY BURST FORTH NOW IN SPONTANEOUS WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. JOB TELLS US WHEN THE WHEN THE MORNING STARS SANG TOGETHER AND ALL THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTED FOR joy and heaven was no longer silent. &gt;&gt; It began to pulse with praise. It began to echo the glory of the ONE WHO HAD SPOKEN IT INTO EXISTENCE. &gt;&gt; AND GOD WOULD NO LONGER BE THE LONELY GOD DWELLING IN SILENCE ALONE. AND BY HIMSELF. AND AS HE SPOKE, HE MOVED IN A MANIFESTATION, &gt;&gt; the logos, the word. For John 1:1 says, in the beginning, here's the beginning. Now, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. You see, the word was God's eternal order, made visible, audible, active. Now heaven is alive AND AND IT'S FILLED WITH LIGHT. IT'S FILLED WITH SOUND. IT IT'S FILLED WITH WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; AND EVEN THE VAST HEAVENS THEMSELVES REFLECT HIS GLORY. THE STAR IS IGNITED AND ROLLED INTO PLACE AT HIS VERY COMMAND. Psalms 147:4 says, "He tellth the number of the stars. HE CALLETH THEM ALL BY their names." AND THE PROPHET SAYS IN IN IN PSALMS 19:1, "THE THE HEAVENS DECLARE the glory of God. The firminant sha showeth his handiwork. Day unto day utter speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge." So the heavens declare his knowledge. THEY UTTER SPEECH. YOU SEE, CREATION IS NOT MUTE. It's expressive. AND MODERN SCIENCE EVEN TODAY WILL CONFIRM THAT WHAT THE SCRIPTURE DECLARED ALL ALONG THAT THE UNIVERSE IS FILLED WITH VIBRATION WITH FREQUENCY WITH SOUND AND THE STARS THEMSELVES WILL CONTINUOUSLY EMIT WAVES SILENT MAYBE to our ears here on the earth BUT YET DECLARING PRAISE to their creator. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yet angels and galaxies, THEY THEY WERE NOT GOD'S ULTIMATE DESIRE. &gt;&gt; IN ALL THAT HE'D DONE, HE WASN'T FINISHED. &gt;&gt; You see, WORSHIP WAS ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH. He had angels worshiping him. &gt;&gt; He had the universe WORSHIP HIM. THE STARS WERE UTTERING SOUNDS. THEY WERE ALL BRINGING PRAISE TO THE TO THE GLORY OF THE ONE WHO HAD CREATED HIM. BUT GOD WANTED MORE THAN WORSHIP. God wanted a family. &gt;&gt; YES, GOD WANTED YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE VERY SUBSTANCE OF THE GOSPEL, WHEN HE SAYS, "GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD." COULD WE BRING IT PERSONAL to you? God so loved you, &gt;&gt; he gave. &gt;&gt; He gave. Yes. &gt;&gt; Here was God's expression. This eternal purpose that had been hid in the depths of his being, A PLACE WHERE BROTHER BRANDON WOULD CALL THE BACK PART OF HIS MIND. AND PAUL WRITES THAT HE THAT GOD CHOSE US IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU WAS NOT YOU WAS NOT THOUGHT OF AS SOMETHING APART from him but chosen in him. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND ANGELS WE KNOW THEY COULD WORSHIP HIM but they could not be born of him. &gt;&gt; STARS COULD DECLARE HIS GLORY BUT THEY COULD NOT LOVE HIM AS SONS AND DAUGHTERS. &gt;&gt; So God formed man and he was NOT JUST A FORMATION IN his thoughts now but he breathed. The Bible said in Genesis 2:7, "AND THE LORD GOD FORMED man out of the dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul." &gt;&gt; God placed his own life inside of humanity. Yes. &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of made in his image. &gt;&gt; Men and women designed to walk WITH HIM, &gt;&gt; TO LOVE HIM, and to fill in heaven and earth WITH WITH WILLING, JOYFUL PRAISE. AND THE BIBLE SAYS IN ROMANS 8:14, AS MANY AS ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THEY ARE THE SONS OF GOD. And they ARE THE OFFSPRING OF GOD, THE CHILDREN THAT ARE NOT BORN OF NATURAL DESCENT. NOR OF HUMAN DECISION OR A HUSBAND'S WILL BUT BORN OF GOD. THIS IS WHAT JOHN 1 DECLARES that we ARE SONS NOT BORN OF NATURAL DESCENT NOT HUMAN DECISION OR A HUSBAND'S WILL BUT GOD'S OWN WILL AND PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU ARE NOT AN ACCIDENT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT EVEN AN AFTERTHOUGHT. YOU ARE A PRE-PLANNED INDIVIDUAL WHO GOD HAS CALLED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND HE PLACED IN YOU OF SEED A GENE OF GOD THAT WAS IN YOU. EVEN THOUGH YOUR BODY IS CORRUPTIBLE, THOUGH YOUR FLESH IS COME FROM SIN, YET HE PLACED WITHIN YOU A PART OF HIMSELF, AN ATTRIBUTE OF HIMSELF THAT ONLY THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAN AWAKEN. Nothing else can do it. You can try any kind of things that chaos has to offer &gt;&gt; and it'll never awaken the predestinated seed. Only the spirit of God can do that. &gt;&gt; You see, this was the desire of God. Sons and daughters who will carry his light and so carry his likeness. In Psalms 82:6, he says, "I said you are God's and all of you are children of the most high, sons in his image." That's what GOD'S DESIRE IS. &gt;&gt; FILLED with his life, THOSE WHO WOULD CARRY HIS BREATH AND BY THEIR BREATH SPEAK HIS WORDS. A PEOPLE FILLED WITH HIS VOICE, PROPHESYING. YES. SPEAKING HIS WORD, DECLARING THE WONDROUS works of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is God's great order. That's his order. And that is from silence to sound, from light to life, from angels to sons. You see, not a LONELY GOD, BUT A FATHER. &gt;&gt; GOD DESIRED FATHERHOOD. HE wanted a family. NOT A SILENT ETERNITY, BUT A LIVING FAMILY. &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY IT AGAIN? GOD WANTED YOU. YES. &gt;&gt; IT HAPPENS TO BE THAT BECAUSE OF OUR PARENTS' SINS THAT WE WERE BORN LOST AND AWAY FROM HIM. &gt;&gt; BUT HE DIDN'T COME TO SAVE EVERYBODY. HE CAME TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST. &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT WAS A PART OF HIM BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN. THAT BECAUSE OF SIN, WE STRAYED AND WENT INTO CHAOS. BUT HE CAME TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST IN CHAOS AND BRING THEIR LIVES BACK IN ORDER AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Everything he's done from the beginning has been moving toward one eternal desire &gt;&gt; and that's Hebrews 2:10 that he might bring many sons unto glory. And this is the realm of DIVINE ORDER THAT TO THE NATURAL MIND it looks like chaos. YOU SEE, BECAUSE ALWAYS WHAT MAN CALLS DISORDER, GOD CALLS MOVEMENT. &gt;&gt; And what THE FLESH WILL LABEL AS CONFUSION, HEAVEN RECOGNIZES IT AS PRECISION in motion. For example, EZEKIEL WAS GIVEN A VISION THAT THAT THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY SHATTER THE IDEA OF humans of a perception OF ORDER. IT'S A REALM WHERE THE PRAISES OF GOD THUNDERED FROM THE CHERUBAM, WHERE WINGS WOULD BEAT TOGETHER, WHERE WHEELS TURNED, AND EVEN THE VERY POST OF THE TEMPLES moved as the spirit of God moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ezekiel 10:4 it says, "And the post of the door MOVED AT THE VOICE OF HIM that cried, and the house was filled with smoke." &gt;&gt; Now, when you look as a carnal observer, this looks like confusion. It looks unsettling. I mean, CHAOTIC CREATURES FULL OF EYES, WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS, MOTIONS WITHOUT PAWS. Yet Ezekiel makes it clear that in in Ezekiel 1:12, uh, WHETHERSOEVER THE SPIRIT WAS TO GO, THEY WENT, THEY TURNED NOT WHEN THEY WENT. And I I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU TODAY, oh that we might learn to do the same. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO BE SO ONE WITH THE SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; THAT AS HE MOVES, we moves. &gt;&gt; AS HE TURNS, WE TURN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS HE WE ARE FOLLOWING HIM AND EVERYTHING AND WE'RE MOVING IN UNISON WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD BECAUSE THAT'S REAL DIVINE order &gt;&gt; is when we move with the spirit of God &gt;&gt; may we learn to do the same &gt;&gt; but you see that's not chaos looks like it to the world looks like it to the mind all of these wheels turning in the wheels cherubam screaming holy holy holy all OF THIS NOISE SO MUCH SO LOUD UNTIL THE THE THE POST of the temple moves &gt;&gt; IN VIBRATION AND UNITY. EVERYTHING MOVING TOGETHER &gt;&gt; AT THE SOUND OF HEAVEN'S VOICE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And it looks like chaos, but it's not chaos. It's God's order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, it's perfect obedience. Every one of moving as the spirit moved. Yes, &gt;&gt; that's what we want our lives. &gt;&gt; This is where we get into chaos &gt;&gt; when we don't move where the spirit moves. &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. AMEN. YOU SEE, THERE WAS NOTHING LAGGING BEHIND. Everything was in unison. NOTHING WAS RUSHING AHEAD. HEAVEN WAS NOT A NOISY CONFUSION. IT WAS ORDERED RESPONSIVENESS. &gt;&gt; Everything moving to his voice. Sometimes the satanic eye looks upon real spontaneous worship and sneers with scorn and cause it noisy confusion. &gt;&gt; But it isn't confusion. &gt;&gt; It isn't chaos. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Tim, ALL THEM PEOPLE DANCING IN THE SPIRIT AND SHOUTING THE PRAISES OF GOD AND RUNNING DOWN THE AISLES. THAT'S THAT'S JUST NOISE. SEE CONFUSION? THAT'S CHAOS. NO, &gt;&gt; that's a response to God's divine order. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's ordered responsiveness. &gt;&gt; Everyone moving as the spirit moves. &gt;&gt; Everyone going as the spirit directs. &gt;&gt; Amen. No one rushing ahead. No one lagging behind. Everybody in unison together. &gt;&gt; Come on. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE A CHURCH SERVICE THAT WOULD BE LIKE HEAVEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVERY PERSON IN DIVINE ORDER. &gt;&gt; EVERY PERSON MOVING AS THE SPIRIT MOVES. &gt;&gt; NO ONE LAGGING BEHIND. NO ONE PULLING BACK. NO ONE RUSHING AHEAD AND GETTING IN THE CELL. BUT EVERY PERSON MOVING TOGETHER IN DIVINE HARMONY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But sometimes the eye of Satan looks on with scorn &gt;&gt; and he sees this spontaneous worship and sneers with scorn thinking it's just noisy confusion. But I'll tell you THAT MORNING, THAT SUNDAY MORNING, WHEN SISTER LANA responded to the word and SHE ROSE UP GIVING PRAISE TO GOD AND SHE RAN SHOUTING AND PRAISING GOD ALL OVER THIS BUILDING. AROUND AND AROUND SHE WENT SHOUTING THE PRAISES OF GOD. THAT WAS NOT NOISY CONFUSION. THAT WAS ORDERED RESPONSIVENESS. AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED. THE CANCER WAS GONE. THE VICTORY WAS WON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE IN THAT TIME OF CHAOS, &gt;&gt; GOD BROUGHT HER BODY INTO ORDER. &gt;&gt; And in that moment, as the spirit of God moved through the audience, there were other healings took place. And as that anointing fell, we prayed over a prayer cloth, sent it to A MAN IN SOUTH AFRICA WHOSE wife had the third stages of of rectal cancer, and he was in distress, terrible distress, had lost his home, had to move in with his wife's parents, you know, not having a job for three years. And there when he received that prayer cloth, laid it upon his wife, she was healed of that cancer. And there immediately afterwards he he he received a job that had BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO FILL FOR THREE YEARS &gt;&gt; held open FOR HIM &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD WOULD STEP INTO HIS CHAOS &gt;&gt; and bring order. &gt;&gt; AMEN. LATER ON, EVEN DURING CO, HE HE TOOK THAT SAME PRAYER CLOTH. HE DROVE, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MILES AND KILOMETERS, BUT HE DROVE maybe hundreds of miles, LAID IT ON HIS BROTHER WHO WAS DYING ON ON A RESPIRATOR, AND GOD healed him and raised him up. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you, THAT'S HOW GOD BRINGS order &gt;&gt; out of chaos. A MAN LAYING THERE GASPING HIS LAST BREATH, &gt;&gt; NEEDING A DIVINE MIRACLE AND THE DOCTOR'S LOOKING AT IT AS IMPOSSIBLE. BUT IN THAT MOMENT OF IMPOSSIBILITY, IN THAT MOMENT OF TERRIBLE CHAOS, GOD STEPPED IN ON THE SCENE and brought order &gt;&gt; into his chaos. &gt;&gt; That's right. This is what the true bride should be doing. &gt;&gt; Bringing order out of chaos because the spirit of God moves and they recognize it &gt;&gt; and they're sensitive to it &gt;&gt; and they don't lag behind &gt;&gt; and they don't let them tell. Somebody tell them days of miracles are passed &gt;&gt; or it was only for the divine healing campaigns. Oh no. You know, but but when WHEN THEY WILL PRESS THROUGH THE CHAOS &gt;&gt; OF UNBELIEF AND ALLOW GOD TO BRING THINGS INTO order &gt;&gt; because he's going to do it for someone. &gt;&gt; Because God's in order, God of order, not of confusion. &gt;&gt; Now, I quote this from brother Brandham. He said when she as Eve had the very filling of the word of God in her hand, she could have took God's word. But what did she do to that? Instead of tearing for the baptism of the Holy Ghost, let science prove to her the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples. Instead of keeping divine HEALING GOING, WHEN SHE OUGHT TO BE NOW RAISING THE DEAD, DOING GREAT MIRACLES, SHE HAS LET SATAN UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP of religious men take the word of God and try to say it was for another age. And she's believed it. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE BIBLE SAID, "THE THINGS THAT I DO, SAY YOU DO ALSO," Jesus said that and go ye unto all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. And we're still creatures. These signs shall follow every one of them that believe. And she denies every bit of it. SHE DENIES ALL THE SUPERNATURAL AND SHE SWAPPED IT FOR HIS INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTION OF THE BIBLE WHERE PRIESTS AND HOLY FATHERS SO-CALLED AND WHERE BISHOPS AND ARCHBISHOPS WERE WHERE DISTRICT PRESPITS AND GENERAL OVERSEERS and so forth has put their own interpretation to it. And God has left them set there dead as 12:00. And the only thing left in the last days is a bunch of little Pentecostals with a bunch of music whooped up as hard as they can, running up and down the floor, speaking in tongues and shouting and having a form of godliness, denying the word thereof. That's not us. &gt;&gt; We're not word deniers. &gt;&gt; Tell them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Laugh in your face. That's not us. &gt;&gt; But that but that God goes right on making it just so just the same. Proving his word to be so. You know that day I think of it at the beginning of the church. Again, IT WAS THE GENESIS OF THE CHURCH. I done took you to the genesis of of of um OF GENESIS CHAPTER 1. TOOK YOU TO THE GENESIS OF JOHN CHAPTER ONE. In the beginning was the word. Now I'm taking you to the genesis of the church. her beginning and that was on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; And the DAY THE PILLAR OF FIRE DESCENDED and divided itself resting on each one of them 120 in the upper room. Well, that moment WASN'T NOISY CONFUSION. It was it again was ordered responsiveness &gt;&gt; to the will of God. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE FULFILLING THE WORD. LISTEN. ACTS 2 AND 3 SAID, "AND THERE APPEARED UNTO THEM CLOVEN TONGUES LIKE AS OF FIRE, AND IT SAT UPON each of them." &gt;&gt; NOW, THE SAME THING THAT WAS IN THE BEGINNING WHEN GOD SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND CREATION BEGAN. AND OUT OF GOD CAME A HALO OF LIGHT THROUGH WHICH ALL CREATION WOULD BE FORMED. AND THROUGH THE WORD OF HIS POWER, HE WOULD BRING THE EARTH, THE MOON, THE STARS, THE GALAXIES INTO EXISTENCE. &gt;&gt; NOW, THIS SAME GOD STANDS BECAUSE HIS WHOLE DESIRE AND HIS DESIGN IS TO HAVE A FAMILY. HIS whole purpose IS TO HAVE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. AND AT THE BEGINNING OF the new creation, &gt;&gt; AMEN, &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY WITH ME NOW. AMEN. WHAT COMES OUT OF GOD? A HALO OF LIGHT, &gt;&gt; A PILLAR OF FIRE. AMEN. And it IT'S IT IS BRINGING TO LIGHT THE PROMISED WORD OF JOEL CHAPTER 2. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT I'LL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH. &gt;&gt; MY SONS AND DAUGHTERS, THEY WILL PROPHESY BY ALL MY YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE VISIONS AND OLD MEN WILL SEE DREAMS. I'LL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH. HE WAS BRINGING THE PAST THE WORD OF EZEKIEL 36:26 WHERE HE SAID THAT THAT I WILL GIVE YOU A NEW HEART AND A NEW SPIRIT AND THEN I'LL PUT MY SPIRIT IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AND THIS WAS THE COMING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE THEOPHONY OF GOD, THE VERY PILLAR OF FIRE AS IT MOVES NOW TO TAKE ON BODIES, &gt;&gt; A BODY, a multimembered body. And to do that, it divides itself in creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was bringing order out of the chaos of sin. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that will bring cha order is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The word made manifest. Now, I I want you to notice the precision. THE THE FIRE DIDN'T FALL RANDOMLY. It didn't fall indiscriminately. It divided. It rested. It filled. Every believer IS RECEIVED EXACTLY WHAT HEAVEN APPOINTED. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT FOLLOWED WAS SPEAKING IN TONGUES. Praise to God, PROCLAMATION, AND YES, PREACHING. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AND THAT WAS NOT CHAOS, BUT IT WAS OBEDIENCE IN MOTION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Somebody help ME PREACH NOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN ACTS CHAPTER 2 AND 4, THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND BEGAN to speak in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this was not as emotion dictated. &gt;&gt; This was not as men decided. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS AS THE SPIRIT GAVE THEM UTTERANCE. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS NOT DISORDERED. THIS WAS THIS WAS ORDERED, STRUCTURED WORSHIP BY THE HOLY GHOST. IT WAS OBEDIENCE TO THE SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; but to the onlooker, &gt;&gt; to the scarnner, &gt;&gt; to the scoffer. And listen, this scoffing would cause Israel to be cut off. &gt;&gt; THIS SCOFFING THAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT HERE WAS A DAY OF JUDGMENT. WHEN ISRAEL REFUSED THE ORDER OF GOD AND CONTINUED ON IN THE CHAOS OF THEIR RELIGION &gt;&gt; AND GOD CUT OFF THE OLIVE TREES BRANCH AND HE GRAFTED IN A WILD OLIVE BRANCH, &gt;&gt; YOU AND ME, GENTILES, PEOPLE WITHOUT A HOPE. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND BECAUSE THEY SCORNED IT, GOD WOULD SEND THEM into horrible tribulation and a dispersal. That's right. &gt;&gt; Where they were dispersed among the nations &gt;&gt; and have been so a scattered people until God's word had promised a reathering &gt;&gt; where he has them gathered now &gt;&gt; where he can bring them out of that chaos &gt;&gt; and bring order. Yes. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you to the onlooker that day. You know, it sounded like it well, IT WAS OVERWHELMING TO THEM. IT IT WAS LIKE DRUNKEN CHAOS, &gt;&gt; BUT HEAVEN RECOGNIZED IT IS PERFECT ORDER. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO SEE SOMETHING. WHAT THEY WERE CALLING CHAOS, &gt;&gt; DRUNKEN DISORDER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD WAS PUTTING A CHURCH IN ORDER, &gt;&gt; IN DIVINE ORDER, &gt;&gt; TO BE AS HEAVEN AS IN ORDER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Listen, it was not drunk and disorder. THIS WAS DIVINE CONTROL. This is men and women moving as the spirit moved, speaking as the spirit gave them utterance. AMEN. COME ON. THIS IS DIVINE ORDER. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE GOD MOVES. HE WANTS HIS PEOPLE IN ORDER WITH HIM, MOVING AS he moves, YIELDED TO HIS SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; DIRECTED BY THE HOLY GHOST, LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; You see, the same spirit that orders galaxy was now ordering sons. The same spirit that had put angels into perfect order of worship was now expressing it in sons born of the spirit. &gt;&gt; The book of revelation in chapter 5, it gives us another picture of heaven itself. And when the lamb takes the book &gt;&gt; and begins to break the seals and and I want you JUST A MO JUST TO get this for a moment is something is happening in the heavens. &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE A CORRESPONDING RESPONSE ON earth &gt;&gt; where heaven touches the earth. NOW WHERE HEAVEN ISN'T THERE ON THE EARTH, NO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THEM. BUT THOSE WHO ARE IN HEAVENLY PLACES, &gt;&gt; THOSE WHO ARE UNDER THAT DIVINE UNCCTION, WHEN HEAVEN MOVES, THEY MOVE. &gt;&gt; Come on. AND WHEN THE LAMB WOULD TAKE THE BOOK AND OPEN THE SEALS, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN ON THE EARTH? THOSE MYSTERIES WOULD BE REVEALED TO A PEOPLE ON THE EARTH. YOU SEE, IT WAS A A SYNCHRONIZATION. IT WAS US MOVED AS AS THE SPIRIT MOVED, we moved. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE MOVED. COME ON, SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THE BIBLE SAID AGAIN THAT WHEN THE SEALS WAS OPEN FOR THE LAMB TAKING THE BOOK, THE RESPONSE OF HEAVEN was immediate and it was unified. IN REVELATION 5 AND 8, THE FOUR AND 20 ELDERS FELL DOWN BEFORE the lamb &gt;&gt; and they sung a new song. &gt;&gt; Think of that, YOU KNOW, AGAIN IN VERSE 13, YOU YOU'LL SEE ANGELS JOIN IN AND SAINTS RESPONDING. CREATION ITSELF SWELLS WITH WORSHIP AS HE SAID, "AND EVERY CREATURE which is in heaven, oh now, AND ON THE EARTH, &gt;&gt; AND SUCH AS ARE IN THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IN THEM HEARD I SAY, BLESSED and honor, and glory, AND POWER BE UNTO HIM THAT SITETH UPON THE THRONE, and the lamb forever more." &gt;&gt; I tell you what, THESE TRUTHS WERE NOT GIVEN YOU TO PUFF YOU UP WITH KNOWLEDGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY WERE NOT THERE TO MAKE YOU BIG BIG WITH WITH BIG STUFFED SHIRTS. NO, HE WAS TO MAKE YOU COME DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU FALL BEFORE THE LAMB AND GIVE HIM PRAISE AND GLORY AND HONOR SUBMITTING YOUR LIFE. LET HIM BRING YOU INTO DIVINE ORDER AND MAN YOU MATCHING THE THE WITH SYNCHRONY with heaven. &gt;&gt; That was not confusion. &gt;&gt; No, what we're reading there is not confusion. That's heaven's symphony. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every voice entering in at the right moment. EVERY RESPONSE FLOWING FROM REVELATION. No one's competing. NO ONE'S DISRUPTING. &gt;&gt; NO ONE'S SEEKING EMOTION. &gt;&gt; ALL ARE CENTERED ON THE LAMB. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT MAN MIGHT CALL OVERWHELMING O OVERWHELMING SOUND, GOD. HE CALLS IT PERFECT HARMONY. HE SAID IT'S A NEW SONG. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT WITH THE SEALS OPEN, IT BRINGS YOU INTO A A SYNCHRONIZED WORSHIP WITH HEAVEN. OH, WE have we try synchronization here on man with man. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. THE LUTHERANS WILL SET OUT THEIR SUNDAY SCHOOL lesson today for everybody to read. &gt;&gt; THE BAPTIST WILL SEND FROM THE HEADQUARTER the the lesson that the preacher is to read. &gt;&gt; You see, THAT IS MAN'S ORDER. THAT IS MAN SYNCHRONIZING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE HAVE A WE HAVE ONE WHO WANTS TO BE THE HEADQUARTERS IN JEFFERSONVILLE THAT WANTS TO SYNCHRONIZE EVERYBODY LIKE THE TOWER OF BABEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WITH WITH ONE ONE CERTAIN TAPE TO LISTEN TO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S MAN'S ORDER. THAT'S MAN'S ORDER. THAT'S CARNAL MAN TRYING TO BRING THINGS UNDER CONTROL. BUT I TELL YOU, WHEN THE WHEN THE HOLY GHOST TAKES CONTROL, HE WILL TAKE A MAN THAT DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AND TAKE HIM OVER AND SPEAK THROUGH HIS VOICE AND PREACH THE WORD OF GOD. AND WHEN HE DOES, DEMONS FLEE. THE POWER OF GOD MOVES. PEOPLE ARE HEALED, DELIVERED, SAVED, SINNERS RUN TO THE ALTAR. &gt;&gt; And when the lamb is central, worship becomes unified. And when the spirit leads, expression becomes synchronized. &gt;&gt; And from Pentecost to the throne room, the pattern is the same. Heaven moves together, responds together, and worships together. &gt;&gt; Each part doing exactly what it was created to do. &gt;&gt; That's divine order. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not silence, &gt;&gt; but spirit governs sound. As Ezekiel 1:21 says, "AND WHERE THOSE WENT, THESE WENT. WHEN THOSE STOOD, THESE STOOD. FOR THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING GOD WAS in the wheels. &gt;&gt; Even the temple itself responded. fixed structures like the post thresholds, places where that men assume is immovable. They begin to shift under the weight OF GOD'S GLORY. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE in God's economy, THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT than alignment with his spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; FOR PEOPLE TO BE UNIFIED WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; AND AND GOD WAS SHOWING EZEKIEL THAT TRUE ORDER IS IS NOT BEING RIGID. IT'S NOT BEING A STUFFED SHIRT. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BEING COLD AS AN ICEBERG. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BEING A COLD MORG. IT IS SENSITIVITY. IT'S NOT FORM WITHOUT LIFE, BUT IT IS LIFE DIRECTING FORM. AS HE SAID IN ZECHARIAH, NOT BY MIGHT AND NOT BY POWER, BUT BY MY SPIRIT, SAYAETH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; But this is where man so often stumbles. We would rather have formality than his presence. We would rather have control over command. We would have rather have man would rather have the routine of rituals over revelation. &gt;&gt; But when God moves, &gt;&gt; oh let me say it. When God moves, &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHAT BROUGHT ABOUT CREATION? THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHEN GOD MOVES, IT IT WILL DISTURB OUR NEED ARRANGEMENTS. IT DEFIES MAN'S ORDER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MAN'S ORDER IS CHAOS. &gt;&gt; YET, HE'S STILL THE GOD OF ORDER. &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE tells us plainly in in 1 Corinthians 14:33, God is not the author of confusion, &gt;&gt; but the author of peace. Let's have a little understanding there because too often we think the peace of God is stillness. But the peace of God does not always mean stillness. &gt;&gt; It means everything moving &gt;&gt; exactly as the spirit wheels. &gt;&gt; Somebody write it down. Amen. The peace of God is not always mean stillness. &gt;&gt; It means everything moving EXACTLY &gt;&gt; AS the spirit wills. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT EZEKIEL SAW IN HEAVEN IS IT OUGHT TO TEACH US A LESSON TODAY THAT WHEN PRAISE GOES FORTH, WHEN WHEN THE SPIRIT MOVES, everything aligned WITH HIM MUST BE WILLING TO MOVE to even the post. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. YOU MAY BE HERE IN THIS CHURCH AND YOU THINK YOU'RE JUST THE POST. &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE YOU JUST FEEL AS DEAD AS A POST DOES. &gt;&gt; BUT I'LL TELL YOU, IN THE ME in the MIDDLE OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD, DEAD THINGS COME ALIVE. &gt;&gt; AARON'S ROD THAT WAS DRY AND WITHERED BLOOMED AGAIN AND BORE FRUIT. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU MOVE INTO GOD'S SPIRIT, THINGS COME ALIVE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise begins to happen. &gt;&gt; The joy bells begin to roll. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God begins to move. &gt;&gt; Creation begins. And light dawn. And as light dawn, revelation comes. &gt;&gt; And there's no revelation greater than the revelation. I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the king. So if God can move pillars of a temple, it can certainly move our traditions &gt;&gt; and rearrange them. &gt;&gt; It can move our expectations. It can move you out of your comfort zone. &gt;&gt; When God moves, HE BRINGS ORDER OUT OF CHAOS. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT AM I TELLING YOU? WHAT AM I TELLING YOU FOR THE YEAR TO COME? Get ready to move &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS MOVING. &gt;&gt; And when he moves, HIS BRIDE HAS TO MOVE WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THOSE WHERE THOSE WENT, THESE WENT. WHEN THESE STOOD, THESE STOOD. BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING GOD WAS IN THE WHEELS. WHEN GOD MOVES BY HIS SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; where he goes, we goes. Where he stands, we stand. And whatever he can lead your faith to believe, that's yours. &gt;&gt; This is how God brings order out of what man calls chaos. &gt;&gt; By placing his spirit in the center and let everything else respond in obedience. &gt;&gt; You know, we and I've seen it. You've seen it. I've been in churches where it's it's it's there. It's their motto. It's there way way up high for every eye to see. The scripture of Psalms 46:10, be still and know that I am God. And most of them take it as a command for everybody to fall silent. But it's not a command for heaven to fall silent. And let me stop here. where we're at this morning. WE'RE NOT JUST IN AN EARTHLY REALM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But we are in a heavenly realm, &gt;&gt; the Bible SAID HE HATH MADE US TO SIT IN HEAVENLY PLACES. &gt;&gt; And here WHEN THE WORD GOES FORTH AND THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT MOVES, THAT'S HEAVEN COMING DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND SO YOU SEE THIS THIS PSALMS RIGHT HERE IS NOT A COMMAND FOR HEAVEN TO FALL SILENCE. IT'S NOT A CALL FOR FOR PRAISE TO CEASE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IT'S NOT INVITING US TO LIFELESSNESS. &gt;&gt; Do you KNOW TO HAVE DEAD FORMAL COLD WORSHIP AND POWERLESS RELIGION? &gt;&gt; RELIGION WITHOUT MO EMOTION. ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; A RELIGION THAT GOD HATES. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WELL, we're not supposed to be emotional. Listen, God's emotional. &gt;&gt; He loves, he hates. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he weeps. &gt;&gt; He even laughs. &gt;&gt; He sings. &gt;&gt; This is all scriptures of your God. &gt;&gt; He's a God of emotion. &gt;&gt; His people also are people of emotion. It's not an emotionalist religion. &gt;&gt; But neither is an emotion without direction. It's an ordered emotion by the spirit. &gt;&gt; But I just want to tell you, God has never desired mute worship. &gt;&gt; He never wants a manufactured stillness &gt;&gt; THAT WILL REPLACE HIS LIFE WITH SOME RITUAL. Heaven has never been quiet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. SCRIPTURE CONSISTENTLY PORTRAYS HEAVEN AS ALIVE with sound and worship and response. &gt;&gt; ISAIAH HEARD THE SERAPHIMS CRYING, "HOLY, HOLY, HOLY is the Lord of the host." JOHN WOULD ALSO HAVE THE SAME REALITY WHEN HE SAYS IN REVELATION 4:8, "THEY REST NOT DAY AND NIGHT, SAYING, "HOLY, HOLY, HOLY." &gt;&gt; YEAH. HEAVEN DOES NOT SHUT DOWN. IT UTTERS. &gt;&gt; MAN WILL SHUT DOWN ON GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD DON'T EVER SHUT DOWN. &gt;&gt; Heaven is never silenced. And when heaven COMES DOWN INTO A CHURCH, THEY move as he moves. &gt;&gt; AS THE WORD GOES FORTH, PEOPLE RESPOND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. When the king is in the midst, AMEN. THEY'VE GOT THE SHOUT OF THE KING AMONG THEM. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S A LIVING GOD AMONG THEM, RESURRECTED, SHOWING SIGNS AND WONDERS, GOD'S CHURCH, MOVING FROM GLORY TO GLORY. &gt;&gt; By the way, that's a quote from the prophet of God. And we believe that there's to be a church in this last day. How many believes it? &gt;&gt; How many believes you're part of that church? &gt;&gt; A church that will receive both the former and latter reign. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that that has happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; The latter the the former reign which is which is the teaching reign. The latter reign which is rapturing faith. This message is rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; And as brother Brandham said, IT'LL BE SCATTERED throughout the world in this leodyian age. It'll be a CHURCH THAT'S CALLED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FAITH. It'll be a church that HAVE JESUS CHRIST WALKING in it, MANIFESTING HIMSELF. THE SHOUT OF THE KING WILL be in it. They said THERE WAS A SHOUT OF THE KING IN THE CAMP. WHAT? WHAT? THE SHOUT OF THE KING. SCREAMS AND JOY. WHAT OF ANOTHER KINGDOM? &gt;&gt; THERE WAS DIVINE HEALING. THERE WAS A SHOUT OF THE KING IN THE CAMP. GREAT SIGNS, DIVINE HEALING, WONDERS AND THINGS PERFORMED AMONG THEM. IT'S A SIGN OF A LIVING GOD among his people. &gt;&gt; Heaven is never silent. &gt;&gt; Heaven is full of life. Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham told the man who said, "Brother Brandom, you know, when them people got screaming and shouting in that church, it could run cold chills all over me." He said, "Brother, you don't ever want to go to heaven &gt;&gt; because if you go to heaven, you'll freeze to death." &gt;&gt; Because in heaven, it's going to be shouting and screaming and rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, heaven is NEVER SILENT. IT'S ALWAYS FULL OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HEAVEN COMES DOWN IN THE CHURCH, chaos ceases. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LIFE IS THERE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S POWER THERE. THERE'S HEALING THERE. Restoration is there. BECAUSE WHEN HE STEPS INTO YOUR CHAOS, &gt;&gt; HE COMES TO BRING ORDER. &gt;&gt; YES, he does. &gt;&gt; Now, the only place in the scripture that speaks of silence as heaven is very specific and very limited. &gt;&gt; Let let me just dis dispel a a theory of man that has went haywire, &gt;&gt; that is out of sync with God's word. I'm going to show you. It's Revelation 8 and1. I'll let him put it up for you. And when he had opened the seventh seal, THERE WAS SILENCE in heaven about the space of a half an hour. &gt;&gt; Somehow we get a notion, you know, when the seventh seal is open that it BEGINS A TIME of silence. It doesn't begin a time of silence. It ends the silence. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you SAY, "WELL, WE BELIEVE THE SEVENTH SEAL IS OPEN." THEN YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THE SILENCE &gt;&gt; HAS BEEN BROKEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD HELD BACK IS A MYSTERY HAS NOW BEEN REVEALED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You see, this was not heaven becoming empty. &gt;&gt; It was It was not worship ceasing. IT WAS NOT CHRIST LEAVING HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, Christ left heaven. That's why heaven was silent because he was coming down in 1963 to open the seals. Uh what confusion, chaos again, &gt;&gt; man's interpretation. &gt;&gt; You see, this was not heaven becoming empty. It was not worship ceasing. It was not Christ leaving heaven. It this was a visionary pause. It was a deliberate withholding of revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; THE SILENCE WAS NOT THE ABSENCE OF LIFE. It was the absence of explanation. &gt;&gt; You see, this the SEVENTH SEAL CONCERNS THE COMING OF THE LORD. And and the meaning of that event was INTENTIONALLY SEALED UP. &gt;&gt; God said, "I ain't going to let it know." John was not permitted to write it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He writes there in Revelation 10:4 when when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I WAS ABOUT TO WRITE AND I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "SEAL UP THOSE THINGS WHICH THE SEVEN THUNDERS UTTERED AND WRITE THEM NOT." &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand something. Silence in heaven, THAT SILENCE WAS NOT permanent &gt;&gt; and it WAS NOT EMPTINESS. WHAT IT WAS WAS A MYSTERY RESERVED AND HELD BACK TO THE END TIME. &gt;&gt; And that mystery would be hidden, REMAIN HIDDEN THROUGH SEVEN CHURCH AGES UNTIL THE APPOINTED TIME. &gt;&gt; You want TO KNOW THE BIBLE TELLS US EXACTLY WHEN THAT SILENCE would be broken. Revelation 10:7, BUT IN THE DAYS OF THE VOICE OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL, WHEN HE SHALL BEGIN THE SOUND, THE MYSTERY OF GOD SHALL BE FINISHED. AS HE HAVE DECLARED TO HIS SERVANTS the prophets. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When that message sounds, the silence ends. &gt;&gt; What was held back is released. &gt;&gt; The seven thunders which had the voices all along were no longer restrained. &gt;&gt; Heaven was never mute. &gt;&gt; It was simply not yet time. And even today there is a portion of that one aspect OF IT THAT IS HELD BACK. &gt;&gt; Do you know when BROTHER BRANDON TALKS ABOUT THE SEVENTH SEAL BEING OPEN AND HE WILL SAY IT'S NOT OPEN HE IS TALKING ABOUT a specific part of it. &gt;&gt; You know WHAT IT IS IS MATTHEW 24:36. BUT OF THAT DAY AND HOUR KNOW IT NO MAN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT AT THAT DAY AND HOUR, HEAVEN IS SILENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SEE, THIS IS NOT BECAUSE HEAVEN IS EMPTY OR INACTIVE OR BECAUSE GOD, BUT BECAUSE GOD HAS CHOSEN TO KEEP THAT MOMENT IN HIS OWN AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS in in Acts 1 and7. He said THIS IS HELD IN GOD'S AUTHORITY OF THAT TIME. THEY WERE ASKING WHEN WHEN WILL YOU DO THIS? WHEN WILL YOU DO THAT? YOU KNOW, HE'S ABOUT TO LEAVE. HE SAID THAT AIN'T FOR YOU TO KNOW. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU YOU TO KNOW. YOU KNOW THE COMING YOU NEED TO TO TO BE INTERESTED IN IS THIS ONE. &gt;&gt; TEAR YOU IN JERUSALEM &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOU ARE ENDUED WITH POWER FROM ON HIGH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE COMING YOU GOT TO GET. &gt;&gt; AND I'LL TELL YOU CHURCH, IF YOU DON'T GET THAT COMING, YOU WON'T GET HIS SECOND COMING. &gt;&gt; You won't meet him in the air. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has got to come. You got to be a part of that coming first &gt;&gt; to be part of his physical coming. &gt;&gt; Is everybody with me? &gt;&gt; So that day and that hour and so brother Brandham when that part of the revelation came he said I know what it is and one thing is it is that third pull but is the third pull. Third pull is not squirrels. Third pull is not creating squirrels. It's not speaking storms out of existence. It's not salvation of Herit's children. That's not the third pull. &gt;&gt; Those are vindications of the third pull. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The third pull was the opening of the seven seals, &gt;&gt; the revealing of the mysteries. that that to make it simple rather than pull the third phase of brother Brandham's ministry was to open up the seals to reveal the mystery. So, one thing it was that third pull. Remember he told him before WHEN HE WAS PRAYING ABOUT HIS END AND HE SAID, "I CAN'T I CAN'T SURVIVE THAT BLAST. I DON'T SEE HOW I COULD." AND HE GOES out onto up there on um there at Sabina Canyon. And at SABINA CANYON, HIS HANDS UP SAYING, "OH GOD, WHAT IS MY FUTURE? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS BLAST? I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD SURVIVE IT. And something strikes his hand &gt;&gt; and it's a sword. &gt;&gt; And he said, "A sword? What do you do with a sword? Unite with, you know, that's what man does. He knits. He elects people and followers and he, you know, he he makes this and bishops and popes and whatever. What do you do with a sword?" He said, "This is not a king's sword. &gt;&gt; This is the king's sword. It is that third pull. &gt;&gt; It was the word coming to a prophet. &gt;&gt; So the seventh seal was the word &gt;&gt; coming to a message. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And the it was those seven thunders uttered right in a row which had taken place every day. THE VOICE OF GOD WAS RELEASED, &gt;&gt; MAKING KNOWN THE MYSTERY THAT WAS WRITTEN, THAT PART WHICH WAS IN SYMBOL &gt;&gt; OF THE SEVEN SEALS. AND NOW, NOW WE KNOW WHAT THE FIRST SEAL IS. We know when he rides. &gt;&gt; Why? BECAUSE THE VOICE OF GOD THUNDERED OUT &gt;&gt; AND REVEALED THE MYSTERY. &gt;&gt; SO THAT WHICH WAS ONCE SECRET IS NOW KNOWN. AND IT AND IT UTTERED RIGHT in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 as every night an angel of God would come a visitor from the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; And would reveal the mystery of that seal. &gt;&gt; So it was it was those seven thunders. And then he said there was another part and it went by me so fast and it was in another tongue &gt;&gt; and I couldn't make out the interpretation because no one will know the day or the hour. &gt;&gt; He said it's the thing that Jesus was silent about. &gt;&gt; And when they asked him Lord when will you will you return? BECAUSE THEY WERE SAYING, "OKAY, WHEN WILL THESE THINGS BE? WHEN WHEN WILL IT BE THAT THAT THAT THE CITY WILL BE SURROUNDED? AND WHEN WILL be that it would be a great persecution? AND WHEN WILL THAT THIS HAPPEN? AND WHEN WILL THAT and and WHAT IS WHAT IS WHAT ABOUT YOUR COMING? &gt;&gt; But at that day and hour, &gt;&gt; I have to be silent about." &gt;&gt; Why? Satan would do great damage with it. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because God wants you under expectancy, &gt;&gt; not to look for him in the year 1977 &gt;&gt; or in the in a year of 20125 and dates COME AND DATES GO. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT FOR YOU TO LIVE EVERY DAY &gt;&gt; EXPECTING him to come. &gt;&gt; A PEOPLE WHO ARE READY, WHO ARE PREPARED, &gt;&gt; A PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FIRE, WHO ARE PRAYED UP, &gt;&gt; WHO HAVE MADE THEIREL READY. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY WITH ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But the idea that heaven became silent and vacant because Christ came down in 1963, that's not even supported by scripture. &gt;&gt; God has come down many times. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't being went to heaven emptied and worship stopped. Hey, you God came down. Look, look, put up this Genesis 11:5. God came down TO SEE WHAT MEN WERE DOING AT BABEL. &gt;&gt; And the LORD CAME DOWN TO SEE THE city and the tower which the children of man builded. Look at Genesis 18:21. GOD CAME DOWN to Abraham concerning Sodom. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Genesis 18:21 said, "I will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the cry of it." In Exodus 3 and 7, GOD CAME DOWN TO MOSES IN A PILLAR of fire. He said, "I HAVE SURELY SEEN THE AFFLICTION OF MY PEOPLE, AND I HAVE COME down &gt;&gt; to deliver." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; BUT NONE OF THESE CASES CAUSED HEAVEN TO CEASE FUNCTIONING. &gt;&gt; NONE OF THIS emptied heaven. &gt;&gt; No, it wasn't emptying heaven. It was expanding heaven. &gt;&gt; HEAVEN WOULD BE EXPANDED AS GOD CAME DOWN TO EARTH BRINGING HEAVEN WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; CUZ EVERYWHERE GOD IS, HEAVEN IS. AMEN. DO YOU KNOW BROTHER BRANDON SAID THE RESURRECTION RAPTURE WILL BE IN THE PLACE THAT IS EXPANDED TO REDEEM US BECAUSE HE WILL LEAVE THE THRONE AND THERE MEET US IN the air in A HE SAYS HE EXPANDS HEAVEN AND THE SAINTS COME INTO THIS DIMENSION AND TOGETHER WE RISE TO MEET THE LORD in the air &gt;&gt; and we won't be earthly people anymore &gt;&gt; but heavenly people. I hope this ain't going over your head. &gt;&gt; I hope you're absorbing it. &gt;&gt; If you're with me, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in none of these cases did heaven cease functioning. Worship didn't stop. Angels were not dismissed. God's descent never empties heaven. It demonstrates his involvement. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the same is true with God because God was in Christ &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself. &gt;&gt; But was heaven empty for three and a half years? &gt;&gt; No. Because even in the incarnation, Jesus said in John 3:13, you can put this up and I'm just going to use the phrase of it, the son of man which is in heaven. because he SAID, "NO MAN HAS ASCENDED UP TO HEAVEN, BUT HE THAT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN, EVEN THE SON OF MAN WHICH is in heaven." &gt;&gt; He said, "Right now, I haven't left heaven." &gt;&gt; Heaven is where I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This is what he said. The son of man, which is &gt;&gt; where? &gt;&gt; In heaven. &gt;&gt; So, you see, EVEN IN THE INCARNATION, I I WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO YOU. HEAVEN IS NOT LIMITED BY GEOGRAPHY. &gt;&gt; GOD'S PRESENCE IS NOT DIVIDED BY HIS MOVEMENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HEAVEN IS NOT EMPTY WHEN GOD COMES DOWN. HEAVEN IS JUST SIMPLY EXPANDING ITSELF TO THE EARTH FOR redemption purposes. Amen. &gt;&gt; As I preached a couple of sermons here some years ago of the day that heaven opens because heaven will open and expand itself. It's the expansion of redemption. So let us have understanding now. Heaven is not silent. Worship has never ceased. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal silence was just God restraining and holding back revelation. It was not absence. &gt;&gt; The thunders always had voices. They were just simply sealed up. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD COMING DOWN IS NEVER emptied heaven. &gt;&gt; Somebody with me. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT MEN MISTAKE IS SILENCE IS OFTEN GOD WITHHOLDING EXPLANATION. He's not withdrawing his presence. AND WHEN GOD CHOSE TO SPEAK AGAIN, WHEN THE TIME WAS RIGHT, THE SILENCE WAS BROKE, THE THUNDERS uttered their voices, AND THE DIVINE ORDER IS ONCE AGAIN DECLARED. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, when when when THE SEVENTH SEAL IS OPEN, AND IT IS. &gt;&gt; AND IT IS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S BRINGING AGAIN DIVINE ORDER. HEAVEN'S ORDER IS TAKING over what man calls order, which is chaos. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know when God brings this order, it's not chaos. It's perfect time to order governed by God alone. &gt;&gt; I marvel at this &gt;&gt; because men try to make things happen. I want you to know every move of God that's ever been has been divinely orchestrated by God. It was never caused by man. &gt;&gt; Man didn't pray it down. Man didn't fast it down. Man didn't shout it down. &gt;&gt; Man didn't scream it down. &gt;&gt; Man didn't educate himself until he come down. HE DIDN'T DO IT BY INTELLECTUAL PROCESS. Somebody help me preach now. &gt;&gt; Every move of God has been that way. &gt;&gt; And you know, now Pentecost 1906, 2026. Now we're what 120 years or so away from the Zuza movement &gt;&gt; and Pentecost. THE PEOPLE, THE CHARISMATICS, ALL OF THEM HAVE TRIED IN VAIN TO FAST, TO FAST, TO PRAY, TO MOVE, to get something TO HAPPEN, TO TO MAKE GOD MOVE. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE FASTED. THEY'VE PRAYED. THEY'VE HELD REVIVAL. THEY THEY THEY'VE WORKED UP THEMSELVES. THEY THEY'VE TRIED TO SHOUT IT DOWN. THEY TRY TO FADE IT OUT. THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING TO TRY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN GOD MOVES, IT'S SOVEREIGN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND I TELL YOU, IT'S GOVERNED BY GOD ALONE. BUT I TELL YOU, GOD HAS DECLARED &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE A FINAL SWEEP IN THIS LAST DAY. &gt;&gt; AND HIS WORD IS STAND SURE AND WE KNOW THAT. AMEN. WHERE THAT WE WILL BE CHANGED IN A MOMENT, IN A TWINKLING of an eye, AND THE GREATEST DIVINE HEALING CAMPAIGN THAT'S EVER BEEN WILL STRIKE THE earth &gt;&gt; and men and women will be turned back to youth again. &gt;&gt; This is not fiction. &gt;&gt; This is when God will step into our chaos &gt;&gt; and bring order again. But in heaven, angels cry, "Holy, holy, holy," and they do it without ceasing. Creation is in constant utterance. As Psalms 19:2 says, "Day unto day utter speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. Heaven is speaking." The stillness that God calls for is not the silence of praise. But it's the stillness of human reasoning, &gt;&gt; human striving and self-order. When it says, "Be still and know that I'm God," it it's quietening the thoughts of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is quietening his opinion. It's silencing his fears. It's it's IT IS SETTING UP ALL OF THE METHODS AND THE SOLUTIONS THAT HE'S FIGURED OUT &gt;&gt; SO THAT THE DIVINE ORDER OF GOD CAN BE RECOGNIZED, TRUSTED, and obeyed. &gt;&gt; He's telling you literally when HE SAYS, "BE STILL, AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD." He's telling you to shut up. &gt;&gt; NOT SHUT UP PRAISE. &gt;&gt; NOT SHUT UP WORSHIP, &gt;&gt; BUT STOP YOUR HUMAN REASONING. QUIT TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. &gt;&gt; QUIT TRYING TO FIX YOUR PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; QUIT. STOP RIGHT NOW. BE STILL AND KNOW I AM GOD. &gt;&gt; I AM IN CONTROL. &gt;&gt; That's God's message to you this morning. &gt;&gt; You've been trying to figure it out how it's going to be. My loved one will come in. I WILL BE WILL FIX MY PROBLEM ON MY FAMILY, my marriage, MY SITUATION, MY PROBLEM, MY HEALTH, &gt;&gt; MY FINANCES, ALL KINDS OF THINGS. YOU YOU TROUBLED IN THE NIGHT AND KEEPING YOU UP AT NIGHT. BE STILL. &gt;&gt; QUIT TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. &gt;&gt; QUIT TRYING TO BE GOD. GIVE IT OVER IN HIS HANDS. &gt;&gt; He's the one in control. &gt;&gt; No, I am God. The Hebrew sense to that word means stop striving. Let go. &gt;&gt; Relax re release and relax your grip. In other words, when he says be still, he is actually telling you quit trying to be God. Do &gt;&gt; you know that psalm? I don't know if you've ever thought of it when he right in the middle of it when he says, "Be still and know that I'm God." It's not a calm psalm at all. &gt;&gt; It's violent. Oh no. Nations are raging. Kingdoms are moved. The earth is shaking. Waters are roaring. &gt;&gt; Mountains are trembling. And right in the middle OF THAT CHAOS, God says, "Be still." &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; That's really powerful. &gt;&gt; He's saying in the midst of the shaking, &gt;&gt; in the midst OF THE CONFUSION, STOP, BE STILL, &gt;&gt; RECOGNIZE. &gt;&gt; I'm in control. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT IS PSALMS 46 AND 7, THE LORD OF HOSTS IS WITH US. THE GOD OF JACOB IS OUR REFUGE. &gt;&gt; Be still &gt;&gt; and know that I am God. &gt;&gt; In other words, let every man's thoughts become silent &gt;&gt; and know and know God in his divine order. Isaiah said it this way. This is Isaiah 55 and8. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, &gt;&gt; neither are your ways my ways, &gt;&gt; saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; When God says, "Be still," what he's telling you is to surrender, &gt;&gt; to surrender your thoughts to his wisdom. &gt;&gt; It's when your human logic can step aside and divine order take command. And Jesus would illustrate this when he when he stepped and stood in that raging storm and the sea was LOUD AND IT WAS VIOLENT. It was chaotic. &gt;&gt; AND YET HE WAS ASLEEP IN THE BOAT. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE ROSE, I WANT YOU TO KNOW HE DIDN'T HE DIDN'T OUTSHOUT THE STORM. &gt;&gt; HE SIMPLY SPOKE WITH AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "PEACE BE STILL." &gt;&gt; That word MEANS BE MUZZLED. HE SILENCED THE CHAOS. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T DO IT BY PANIC, EXCITEMENT. HE DID IT BY HEADSHIP. &gt;&gt; Then he asked his disciples, "Why are you so fearful? Don't you have any faith?" &gt;&gt; You know, the storm wasn't the problem. &gt;&gt; Their unsettled thoughts was the problem. And I want you to know, even in the chaos that you're in, the thoughts are the problem. &gt;&gt; Your unsettled thoughts, &gt;&gt; not the storm. &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't care how big the waves are. &gt;&gt; And I don't care how noisy the wind &gt;&gt; and the bolts of lightnings and the thunder. I don't care how terrible it seems AND HOW CHAOTIC IT IS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU CAN JUST LET YOUR FAITH SPEAK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEN THAT STORM HAS TO CEASE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE TRUE STILLNESS IS ALIGNMENT. IT'S NOT INACTIVITY. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID, "THOU WILL KEEP HIM IN PERFECT PEACE WHOSE MIND IS STAYED on thee." Notice the mind is still but faith is active. &gt;&gt; Worship continues. Praise flows but it flows from revelation &gt;&gt; not confusion. &gt;&gt; From submission, not striving. You know, I've seen it sometimes where shouting is Yeah. It's kind of letting off emotion. It makes you feel good just to scream it all out. But let me tell you, that's not that's not worship. &gt;&gt; That's release of emotion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Worship is giving praise to almighty God. It's not releasing some pinup feeling. &gt;&gt; It's surrendering your feelings and your thoughts to God. &gt;&gt; Notice here, faith is active. Praise continues. Oh, worship flows. It flows from revelation, not confusion. It comes from submission, NOT STRIVING. &gt;&gt; LIKE PAUL SAID, "LET EVERYTHING BE DONE IN decency and in order." &gt;&gt; Do you know? Do you know that chapter where that's quoted from 1 Corinthians 14:40? Do you know it's full of tongues and prophecy and worship and vocal expression and and and yet God calls it order. Amen. &gt;&gt; He does. Why? Because it's governed by the spirit, not the flesh. &gt;&gt; God's order does not suppress life. It directs it. &gt;&gt; So be still doesn't mean do nothing. &gt;&gt; IT MEANS KNOW THAT HE IS GOD. &gt;&gt; Know that he rules. KNOW THAT HIS WORD WILL HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER FOR you in YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; KNOW THAT WHEN YOUR HUMAN WISDOM AND YOUR HUMAN THOUGHTS AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT, SHUT UP. THEN DIVINE wisdom can speak clearly. &gt;&gt; And when your voice subsides, God's eternal order becomes unmistakable. And that's stillness. Not silence without life, but life that is governed in by revelation. So like I said, Paul's Paul is talking about God's order when he says, "Let all things be done in decency and in order." And do you know people get it all wrong? They think that statement is a rebuke of of spiritual life. It is not. &gt;&gt; It's not a rebuke of spiritual life. It's the correction of spiritual disorder. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is it this very chapter that Paul speaks of order is OVERFLOWING WITH TONGUES AND prophecy and revelation, interpretation, prayer, vocal worship. &gt;&gt; And this is important. God did NOT CALL SILENCE ORDER. HE CALLED SPIRIT GOVERNED EXPRESSION ORDER. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER SHUT DOWN THE MOVE OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; In fact, he warned THE CHURCH AGAINST DOING EXACTLY THAT. 1 THESSALONIANS 5:19 SAYS, "QUENCH NOT THE SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; DESPISE NOT PROPHESYING." &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. So instead of suppressing suppressing spiritual manifestation, he was protecting them, &gt;&gt; bringing them back into divine harmony. &gt;&gt; You see, there was a problem in Corinth. And the problem in Corinth was not that they had too much spirit. That's right. &gt;&gt; It wasn't THAT THEY HAD TOO MUCH HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; It was too much self. &gt;&gt; You know, EAGERNESS FOR MANIFESTATIONS, COMPETITION FOR VISIBILITY, DESIRE FOR POSITION had taken what was holy and and it made it chaotic. &gt;&gt; SO PAUL DIDN'T SAY, "QUIT SPEAKING. STOP SPEAKING." NO, he didn't. Let's look at it. 1 Corinthians 14:27, he said, "Let it be by course. &gt;&gt; Did you hang up on me?" &gt;&gt; Well, let me dial again. Operator. Operator. Yeah, I'm old enough to have a rotary dial. &gt;&gt; Somebody out there hung up. He did not stop the spirit. He did not cage the gifts. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let it be by course." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Stop prophesying." &gt;&gt; He said, instead in verse 29, "Let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge." I'm telling you, he didn't remove liberty. &gt;&gt; He was restoring headship. &gt;&gt; The spirit was moving, but there were men running ahead of him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And whenever MAN RUNS OUTRUNS GOD, THERE'S CONFUSION THAT FOLLOWS. REMEMBER, WHERE HE MOVES, YOU MOVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND AND PAUL REMINDED THEM, YOU KNOW, THE SPIRITS OF THE PROPHETS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROPHETS. IN OTHER WORDS, THE HOLY GHOST DOES NOT OR OVERRIDE DIVINE ORDER. He operates within it. Why? Because God is not the author of confusion. &gt;&gt; But appease in all the churches of the saints. &gt;&gt; So he wasn't trying to repress it. He was trying to align it. &gt;&gt; He tuned the instruments of the church so the symphony of God could be heard clearly because why? When every voice tries to lead, &gt;&gt; noise replaces music. &gt;&gt; But whenever member moves in their APPOINTED PLACE, THE BODY CAN FUNCTION in harmony. &gt;&gt; For the body is not one member but many. So we have to work together in unity. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit never creates chaos. &gt;&gt; Fleshly ambition does that. &gt;&gt; Paul restored the balance SO THE FLOW OF THE SPIRIT COULD CONTINUE WITH WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. ORDER DID NOT STOP REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; IT SUSTAINED IT. AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS, CHURCH ORDER was never intended to be a law. &gt;&gt; But a pattern, &gt;&gt; an example of how to conduct a service in a way that allows the spirit to move freely. &gt;&gt; Carnly cornly minded men, however, they they like to turn patterns into rigid legislation. And when that happens, the spirit the the service is no longer spirit &gt;&gt; it it's rule driven and they end up killing the life of the service by clinging to the letter instead of allowing the spirit to give it life. &gt;&gt; And when divine order is restored, liberty increases, revelation becomes more real, more sharpened, and worship becomes edifying rather than confusing. And that's WHY THAT'S WHAT PAUL COULD SAY IN THE MIDST OF ALL SAYING ALL THIS. HE SAYS, "I THANK MY GOD I speak in tongues more than you all." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Forbid not speaking in tonesues." &gt;&gt; But rather that you prophesy &gt;&gt; because it's better to understand than to speak in a language than nobody understand. &gt;&gt; Because when you're praying in the spirit in an unknown tongues, you are praying uh you're praying to God and nobody understands. and no one is edified. But when one prophesies, he reveals the secrets of the heart. &gt;&gt; So God's order is not to CAGE OR TO STOP THE SPIRIT'S MANIFESTATION. IT IS RATHER TO CHANNEL THE SPIRIT. IT DOESN'T QUENCH THE FIRE. IT GIVES THE THE FIRE A PLACE LIKE A HEARTH TO BURN. &gt;&gt; You you see there it can burn steadily. It can give give light to to everything WHEN WHEN GOD is and the spirit is HONORED AND THE FLESH IS SUBDUED AND HEAVEN AND EARTH once move once more can move in harmony together. I'm running out of time. I didn't make any vows. I made no New Year's resolutions. I'm not breaking anything. So, I hope you'll resolve to listen to the end. &gt;&gt; Heaven once moved in perfect harmony. &gt;&gt; Every being knew its place. &gt;&gt; Every voice knew its part. ALL WORSHIP FLOWED IN ONE DIRECTION toward God alone. There was no puffed up men. &gt;&gt; There was no great angels &gt;&gt; exalting themselves. There was no competition. There was no ambition. There was no disorder. &gt;&gt; The stars of God shone in their appointed orbits. &gt;&gt; Heaven's order was sustained by joyful submission to the will of a most holy God. But Lucifer, Lucifer desired another order. It would be an order centered on himself. &gt;&gt; And the scripture pulls back the veil and lets us see what was right in his heart. For in Isaiah 14:13 says of him, "Thou has said in thine heart. I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I WILL SIT UPON THE MOUNT of the congregation in the sides of the north. I will be like the most high. Notice this is where rebellion began. This is where chaos began. &gt;&gt; We showed you where God was bringing order and brought everything in order. Now let's look at C rebellion. And it was not first in action. It was in his heart. &gt;&gt; Do you know that's where sin begins? Long before people leave the message &gt;&gt; physically, they leave it in their heart &gt;&gt; first. &gt;&gt; Rebellion began in his heart. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan didn't want to abolish worship. He wanted to redirect it. And he reasoned HIMSELF THAT ALL OF THIS GLORY AND all of this praise should not belong to God alone. I too will be worshiped. I will have a throne. So he says in verse 13, I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation. Look now the congregation, the church &gt;&gt; in the sides of the north. Psalms 48:2 tells us of Mount Zion, the city of the great king in the sides of the north. HE SAYS, "I WANT God's place." &gt;&gt; And this is THE SOURCE OF ALL SIN. &gt;&gt; WHEN MAN EXALTS HIS WILL, ABOVE GOD'S WILL. &gt;&gt; And Luther's ambition was clear. I'm going to take God's place. I'll sit where only God belongs. I'll rule in the hearts of worshippers. And this was not just merely rebellion. It was a spiritual coup. It was an attempt to replace divine headship with selfexaltation. And this is exactly how what happens when when when you when you when you move out into sin. What is it? It is you accepting it accepting selfexaltation your will above God's word. &gt;&gt; And it's a spiritual coup. It's it's an overthrowing of of THE WILL OF GOD FOR YOUR LIFE. And this has ALWAYS BEEN SATAN'S STRATEGY. He does not he doesn't just openly oppose the message. No, he corrupts it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He He He doesn't just TRY TO STOP THE GENUINE MOVES OF GOD. HE TRIES TO ENTER IN THEM. &gt;&gt; HE TRIES TO DILUTE THEM &gt;&gt; TO redirect them &gt;&gt; and eventually institutionalize them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, scripture warns us very clearly in 2 Corinthians 11:14 that Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. And his danger is an obvious then. It's not obvious evil. It's counterfeit light. &gt;&gt; And from the beginning, Satan has never said don't worship. Instead, he says, "Worship, but not exactly the way God said." &gt;&gt; And this was his tactic in Eden. You know, he comes and he says, "Yay hath God said." You see, he didn't deny the word outright. &gt;&gt; How many times in brother Brandon go over this for us? &gt;&gt; It was questioned. It was adjusted. It was misinterpreted. &gt;&gt; And the SAME METH METHOD HAS FOLLOWED EVERY GENUINE move of God. IN LUTHER'S DAY, GOD RESTORED THE TRUTH OF JUSTIFICATION BY faith and light. IT IT IT DAWNED AFTER AND BROKE THROUGH the through centuries of darkness. But Satan quickly moved IN TO HARDEN THE THAT revelation and the creeds into the systems of man. And what began as a living faith gradually became dead orthodoxy. &gt;&gt; That's right. and the truth they had preserved. Oh yeah, they held on to that, but they lost the life of it. &gt;&gt; I want you to know they still quoted Luther &gt;&gt; and and his recordings, &gt;&gt; but the light had left. You say, "Well, we have today the voice of God recordings." Listen, this is not the only day the voice of God has been recorded. &gt;&gt; The voice of of God has been recorded since Genesis. &gt;&gt; Paul recorded his voice, the voice of God, left it for generations to come. He he said it was to be read in all the assemblies. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That everybody should hear what Paul said &gt;&gt; should be read in all the s assemblies. The recording of God should be read in all assembly. But he didn't replace ministry with it. &gt;&gt; What's the pattern? &gt;&gt; Watch what real men of God do. They recognize God's voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. It certainly is in recordings. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS IS GOD'S VOICE ON PAPER. &gt;&gt; And we also have A MESSAGE IN THIS LAST DAY WHERE that we CAN HEAR WHAT GOD SAID TO A GENERATION. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD STILL SPEAKS THROUGH THE MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE'S SPEAKING TODAY FROM THE PULPIT. HE'S MINISTERING TO HEARTS TODAY. HE'S TRYING TO BRING HE'S TRYING TO BRING ORDER &gt;&gt; TO YOUR CHAOS. &gt;&gt; Light into your darkness. &gt;&gt; But you see, it wasn't long till they did what Paul said. They fell from grace, not by sin, but returning to systems. In Wesley's day, God restored to holiness and sanctification. And there were hearts that were set on fire. lives were changed. You know, there was order brought out of into lives of men and women who were in chaos. But Satan moved in. And it wasn't persecution. And they had persecution. It wasn't persecution that destroyed it. IT WAS WHAT DESTROYED THAT MOVE OF GOD WAS FORMALIZING IT. &gt;&gt; The experience BECAME A DOCTRINE. &gt;&gt; THE DOCTRINE became a requirement. And the FIRE COOLED TO A structure &gt;&gt; and what was meant to cleanse the heart became a measured standard instead of a living work of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And at Isuza Street, it happened again. &gt;&gt; God restored the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the spirit. And there was humility, repentance, unity, power. But Satan entered in again. Remember, he don't stop it. He just enters in. &gt;&gt; He gets right in it through pride, through racial division, through personality cults, &gt;&gt; through denominational controls. And what began as unity would be fractured into organizations. And Paul warned again, having begun in the spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh? And today, today the same spirit is at work. When God is calling for full restoration, for continuity with the word of God, once again, Satan is not trying to stop it. HE'S JUST TRYING TO MANAGE IT. &gt;&gt; HE PUSHES PLATFORMS INSTEAD OF PRESENCE. AND PLATFORMS ARE BUILT BY MEN. PLATFORMS THAT HAVE AN AGENDA. PLATFORMS THAT DOMINATE. THAT MAKES HEADQUARTERS FOR CONTROLS THAT REGULATE. Platforms that remove the spirit and diminishes diminishes the power and tries to control the flow. &gt;&gt; But presence is given by God. &gt;&gt; And nothing, let me tell you, nothing can replace the cloud of glory. &gt;&gt; Nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you church, we can have all the structure we want. We can have the finest music. We can have the greatest singing. We can have ordered SERVICE. WE CAN HAVE RITUAL after ritual. But if we lose the spirit, we've lost everything. &gt;&gt; Because it's only when the spirit of God moves, &gt;&gt; the chaos is brought into order. I'm going to have to leave some of this for another time. I don't know if I'll pick this up again, but I'd like just a moment just to take a couple examples as I bring this down to a close this this morning. And I I want you to think of how God does this, how that God moves and how he bring things out of chaos and bring it into order. And if I can just find the place there that I can just bring it to you today where you can you can see clearly what we're talking about because you know there are there were times that Jesus would come to bring order into people's lives. And fact of the matter is GOD WOULD COME DOWN INTO CHAOS. And I COULD TALK ABOUT THE CHAOS of the Sadducees and the chaos of the Pharisees and the chaos of the Roman GOVERNMENT AND THE CHAOS that Israel was in. AND HEAVEN WOULD EXPAND ITSELF FOR THE PURPOSE of redemption. And God would step down in the chaos because he's coming now not to save an organization. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE WOULD NOT COME TO RE TO reform the Pharisees. &gt;&gt; NEITHER WOULD HE COME TO TRY TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE SADDUCEES. But he WAS LOOKING FOR HIS OWN. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. HE WAS LOOKING FOR his people, &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT WERE IN HIS THOUGHTS, THOSE THAT WAS IN HIS MIND. And there HE WAS NOT HE WAS NOT PREACHING ORDER, HE WAS ORDER INCARNATE. &gt;&gt; AND HERE HE WAS WALKING UPON THE EARTH. And when he WALKS INTO THE EARTH, THIS ONE STEPS RIGHT INTO THE chaos of a woman that is at the well. AND THIS WOMAN, HER LIFE IS EMPTY. IT IS VOID. It is without form. And there is darkness covered the deep places of her soul. Oh, the winds and the ravages OF SATAN BLEW ACROSS IT. MIGHTY STORMS WAS THERE. A TROUBLED MIND, A TROUBLED HEART, a troubled life. &gt;&gt; Sin had taken her further than what she would ever want to go. It had done things she had never intended to. &gt;&gt; It had taken a girl that was started out pure and a virgin and defiled her in so many ways. She was so now unclean until she couldn't even fit into even what men called order. Yet, exactly when God moved the first time, &gt;&gt; there was seeds that had been planted &gt;&gt; that had to come to manifestation. &gt;&gt; And for that to happen, THE SPIRIT OF GOD would have to move. &gt;&gt; And when THE SPIRIT OF GOD WOULD MOVE, IT WOULD SAY, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." AND SEEDS THAT WERE THERE UNDER THE WATER NOW WOULD COME UP AND HERE THERE WOULD BE AND THERE WOULD BE LIFE COME INTO THE WATERS AND THEN THE THE THE THE MOUNTAINS and the and THE THE THE LAND FORM AND AND NOW ON THE LAND seeds had been planted AND NOW AS THE LIGHT BEGAN TO DAWN AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED. HE WOULD COME UP ONE PLAN after another after another after another until he finally comes to a man that would be in his image that would be God breathed. &gt;&gt; Now God's wanting to do the same because his pattern never changes. And he steps down into chaos. Cuz hidden beneath that brokenness of that woman at the well was a seed fornown of God. &gt;&gt; It had been placed there before the foundation of the world. AND THE BIBLE SAID HE HAD NEED TO GO BY SAMARIA. &gt;&gt; Oh my, THINK OF THAT. GOD had a need. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU THINK YOU THINK THE WOMAN HAD A NEED? AND SHE DID. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS MORE THAN A WOMAN HAVING A NEED. IT WAS A GOD THAT WAS CALLING OUT FOR A FAMILY. &gt;&gt; I NEED A DAUGHTER. I MUST FIND THIS ONE THAT IS LOST. &gt;&gt; And I DIDN'T COME TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS TO REPENTANCE. I COME TO SEEK AND SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST. &gt;&gt; MAN HAD MADE THEIR RIGHTEOUSNESS. THEY HAD THEIR RELIGION. THEY HAD THEIR POP. THEY HAD THEIR CELEBRITIES. They had their holiness. But God bypassed all of that, &gt;&gt; looking for beyond man's righteousness, &gt;&gt; cuz he wasn't going to call them to repentance, but he was looking for lost ones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE CREATION BACK THERE, IT LOOKED LIKE A LOST CREATION. A CREATION LOST. YEAH. &gt;&gt; A creation in turmoil, &gt;&gt; a creation in chaos. And that was this woman, all that time, her life was ruled by chaos. But in her soul was a seed. AND THAT SEED WAS CRYING FOR EXPRESSION. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I THINK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, GOD HAD A DESIRE. REMEMBER GOD, IT IS HIS WILL TO SAVE. IT HIS WILL TO HEAL. IT HIS WILL TO DELIVER. IT IS HIS WILL TO BRING ORDER. &gt;&gt; Here's a woman and she has a seed and is crying for expression. It is cried for expression and tried to find it in her husband. And that man deceived her and let her down. And she took another and she took another and she went from man to man to man to man. All the reason because she had a seed crying for expression. But chaos was over the face of the deep. Sin had his hold and the winds of Satan blew at night. There was no peace. She cried out to God. She searched for him. She even tried different religions. She became religious. She could quote the scripture &gt;&gt; cuz she was reaching for satisfaction. Like some of you, you went from church to church to church to church cuz you were a seed crying for expression. &gt;&gt; And in her chaos, she had religion, but religion wasn't going to help her. &gt;&gt; Religion just made her more miserable, &gt;&gt; self-righteous. And here the MESSIAH IS STANDING RIGHT BEFORE her and she has her profession and she says, "Our fathers worshiped in this mountain." And you say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship. And she knew forms. She knew locations. She knew arguments. &gt;&gt; She knew the arguments of the Pharisees and the arguments of the Jews and the arguments of of THE UH THE SAMARITANS. AND THEY SAID, "WE WORSHIP HERE AND WE WORSHIP THERE AND SHE'S TORN THIS WAY. IT'S TORN THAT WAY." AND SHE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; And Jesus saw that she knew all kinds of religion, but she didn't know peace. &gt;&gt; And he redirect redirected her form from religious confusion, from that chaos to divine order. And he said, "The hour cometh, and now is when the true worshipper shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; For the Father seeketh such to worship him." &gt;&gt; This is the order God seeks. And then he touched the root of her chaos and said, "Here's the root of your chaos. is all contained in a threeletter word s i n and he exposed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've had five husbands and the one you're living with is not your husband. What was happening? TELL ME WHAT WAS TAKING place again. IT WAS A GENESIS. &gt;&gt; It was a beginning. &gt;&gt; It was a beginning for this WOMAN AT THE WELL. SHE SHE HAD NEVER HAD A BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; All her life had ever been was an end. &gt;&gt; It was evil. It was ruined. It was wrecked. But the same one that has stood there in the portals between heaven and earth and looked over chaotic earth, look now upon a chaotic woman whose nature is all disturbed that is blown by Satan by every wind and every thought and every EVERYTHING EVER CHASING THIS, CHASING THAT PLEASURE, CHASING THIS, CHASING THAT AND NOTHING SATISFIES. AND ALL THE REASON WHY WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A SEED inside calling &gt;&gt; for expression. &gt;&gt; And the one who had created the seed now was passing by her way cuz he had a need to pass by Samaria. &gt;&gt; And the ONE THAT IN THE BEGINNING SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." HE SAID AGAIN, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." AND LIKE DAWNED IT &gt;&gt; AND IT QUICKENED THE PREDESTINATED SEED. AND HER SEED JUMPED TO LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND SAID, "COME SEE A MAN WHO HAD TOLD ME ALL THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE. ISN'T THIS THE VERY MESSIAH?" SHE RECOGNIZE him as the Christ. &gt;&gt; Because why? When light comes from he who stops the chaos. When light dawns on the soul from the word being released, the chaos stops and peace begins. Her seed was crying. There's another one. He's standing way across the sea. His life is in shambles. His home has been wrecked. His marriage is gone. His children despising afraid of him. His fellow men have drove him out. Only place he can find is a tomb. He's haunted. He's tormented. One sin, that first sin invited one devil in. That one invited another. &gt;&gt; That one invited another. That one invited another. &gt;&gt; Until there were so many there were legions. And now his identity is with the demon powers. &gt;&gt; My name, my identity is legion. I'm a wrecked soul. I'm a ruined person. Nobody wants me. I'm an outcast. I've been chained and they tried TO CONTROL ME WITH MEN'S RULES. THEY PUT ME IN JAILS. THEY HAVE TRIED TO REFORM ME. I BROKE THE CHAINS, BUT I REPEAT IT ALL AGAIN. &gt;&gt; I GO BACK TO THE TOMBS. &gt;&gt; IT'S A CYCLE I CAN NEVER GET OUT OF. &gt;&gt; And in a moment, that seed in him cried for expression. And there was one that heard it &gt;&gt; when he whispered a prayer just in that moment. &gt;&gt; Jesus or God, help me &gt;&gt; somehow. Help me. &gt;&gt; And then the demons take him again and he's out of his mind, raging, anger, frustrated, terrorized, tormented. destroyed &gt;&gt; cuz that's what sin does. &gt;&gt; It holds you captive, holds you bound. It takes you down into chaos. &gt;&gt; I know the world will call it pleasure. The world will call it order, but it's chaos because sin has control. And Satan has a headship. He didn't know it, but across the sea, God had stepped into flesh. &gt;&gt; And he heard his voice &gt;&gt; and he says, "We must leave this meeting &gt;&gt; and GO TO THE OTHER SIDE." AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH JESUS GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE, IT WOULD STOP ALL THE CHAOS. NO, THE CHAOS GOT WORSE. &gt;&gt; Satan began to disturb nature itself. AND NOW BEGIN THE WAVES BEGIN TO ROAR. YOU KNOW, THE VIOLENCE INCREASED. THE HORRIBLE THINGS BEGIN TO HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND AGAIN TO TRY to keep Jesus from getting to a seed. But this God can't be stopped. &gt;&gt; He's more powerful than all the legions of hell. &gt;&gt; He's the one who said in the beginning, "Let there be light." And there was light. And now he steps into the boat &gt;&gt; and from there steps into land. And he's not coming to be defeated. &gt;&gt; He's walking with a purpose. He's looking into a tomb. He's looking to find a soul that is darkened, that is tormented, that is wretched, that is miserable, &gt;&gt; THAT IS CRYING, THAT JUST SAID THAT LITTLE ONE MOMENT, God somehow help me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish Jesus was here. &gt;&gt; He's come all the way from glory. He's here in the form of his Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He steps into the flesh of a man. He wakes him up in the middle of the night. He tells him to preach a sermon to bring order out of chaos &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S A SEED crying &gt;&gt; for expression &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD HAS A NEED TO GO BY YOUR WAY &gt;&gt; TO INTERRUPT THE DEVIL'S PLAN &gt;&gt; TO INTERRUPT WHAT HE WOULD DESTROY AND HE WOULD RUIN AND TO BRING ORDER INTO YOUR CHAOS. He's here this morning to do that very thing. &gt;&gt; To bring your life into order &gt;&gt; and to bring it out of that chaos &gt;&gt; of sin that you've been in &gt;&gt; and to loose the bonds and make you a free man or woman to worship God. &gt;&gt; I want you to bow your heads with me because the same one that said, "Let there be light." And he rolled up the planets, the stars from of his hands, formed them in the palm of his hands. That's saying, "God is here this morning." And he's revealing himself in human flesh, speaking to you this morning a divine message to bring order in your chaos. I've considered it in these last few days and I told brother Timothy maybe told some of the ministers God is making his last call but he says my wedding supper will be filled. He's sent out calls. Men and women have made two many excuses. I married a wife. I bought a yoke of oxen. I bought a piece of land and got to go see it. Made excuses. Life, the busyiness of life to where they had no time to come to his supper. How long will you continue to make excuses? Your excuses doesn't cause God any sympathy. The Bible said and the king was angry. He said, "But my supper will be filled." So he starts a divine healing campaign and he sends out says bring in the halt, the ma, the halt and blind, the lame. No matter how crippled, how deformed, how wretched, how miserable, bring them in. And they come back and said, "Yet there's still room." He said, "Well, then go out to the highways and the byways. Compel them all. Come in. I think of that day when the prodical son came home. He was a son, but he was in chaos. He ate with the pigs, but he was always a son. He sold all his inheritance, but he was always a son. The new birth is not where you become a son. The new birth is when you realize who your the source of your life is. who father is where you realize your sunship. When the prodal came, the father was looking for him. He'd been waiting for this moment. He'd never give up. You know, preachers might give up on you. Parents might give up on you. School teachers might say, "Ah, there's never a hope for that boy, that girl. Their life is too much in shambles." Society may give up on you, but God never gives up. He's looking for you, but you got to make a step. The Bible said, "Draw nigh to God. He'll draw nigh to you." And I'm inviting you today if you're in chaos for you to allow the Holy Spirit to come and change your life. The altar is open. The invitation is there. He wants to bring some order to your chaos. God bless you. He sees you. He sees your heart. Sincere before God. Would there be another? Some of you reached out to me last night. Brother Tim, I need to speak with you. God just spoke to you. Why don't you let him deal with you right now? Say, I feel the pull today. I want a new beginning today. I won't send nature dead in my life today. I don't want to be possessed by all of those legions or add another devil to my life this year. I want to be free. I want the monkey off my back. I don't want to serve sin any longer. Let him move right now in your life. If you can feel a pull, if you can feel him touch, he steps out to bring order into your chaos. As I sing it, you come. I feel the pull. I hear the call. The spirit bids come now &gt;&gt; say I'd like to give my life to Christ. I'd really like to consecrate it. &gt;&gt; I really want to be really surrendered. &gt;&gt; I want peace in my life. &gt;&gt; I want joy. I've never known joy. It would be horrible to say you was always in this life and you never knew peace. &gt;&gt; But he's the prince that brings peace. &gt;&gt; He invites you right now. The spirit bids come. &gt;&gt; I feel the &gt;&gt; I feel the Yes. I hear &gt;&gt; I hear the &gt;&gt; Can't you hear him calling you? Is there deep calling to the deep? &gt;&gt; Amen. Is there something there you want to just consecrate and dedicate? &gt;&gt; Is there some little bit of chaos there that you want settled this morning? &gt;&gt; Do you want him to move in your life? &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I agree. Yes, Lord. I'm going to agree with you with your word. &gt;&gt; Please come take control. I feel the I come to hear the word and with &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is he doing? He's calling me to give. What about it? &gt;&gt; A higher praise. &gt;&gt; What is it now? There's a day called to the day like a great flag. I know for sure I reach the door where I feel the Just talk it over with him right now. Amen. I feel good. Amen. I can be right there in your seat. Amen. I don't have to be up here, but wherever it is, &gt;&gt; let him come and step into your chaos. Let the light dawn within your soul, within your being. &gt;&gt; The joy of the Lord be yours. &gt;&gt; Oh, I he speaks to me. &gt;&gt; And I agree. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord reach and take control. I feel the cold. Last night I lay in bed. &gt;&gt; At night I lay in bed and I be to cry. &gt;&gt; Here he's speaking. &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid. I'm going to bring Glory &gt;&gt; into chaos, out of chaos. I'm going to bring them back like they were in my mind before the beginning. Before Shan ever took them. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It must be God. is my soul for I feel the home. Amen. Maybe some other people want to come around and pray with these at the altar right now. Maybe you see a friend there. Maybe you see a brother. Maybe you see a sister. You'd like to come right now. &gt;&gt; This is divine order. Amen. The Bible said we call on the name of the Lord, we'll be saved. Maybe there's somebody right now. You want to just consecrate your life again to God. You you want to surrender, dedicate yourself a new. You You want a fresh anointing. Amen. You want a greater order of the Holy Spirit in your life. You can move if the spirit moves. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want the spirit to breathe over you this morning. Amen. To breathe the breath of God into my life, into my heart today. Yes, Lord. I I feel the Oh yes, Lord. Amen. That's right, Kath. I feel this time, surrender that life to God. I &gt;&gt; know. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every person in the church right now, I want you to be in prayer right now. Right now in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. I bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus. May the Holy Spirit move on your life today. Breathe, oh Holy Ghost. Breathe on this one right now in Jesus name. Amen. Feel the I hear the call. His spirit's move in me in my own. He speaks to me and I agree. Lord, please come. Take control.

Thou are called, Lord, do compass me. Oh my savior. Yes, my savior. I say, &gt;&gt; "Oh, say here my cry and thou are Holy. Oh, do not pass me by. And oh, and thou the spring of all my comfort. You are more than light to me. Where have I on earth beside? Beside thee in heaven but thee. Oh saveior, saveior, hear my cry. And while on others that are called, oh, do not pass me by. And Lord, I come to you. Let my heart be changed, renewed, flowing from the grave that I found in you. And Lord, I've come to know the weaknesses I see in me will be stripped away. Oh, by the power of your love and oh ghost. Let your love surround me and bring me near. Draw me to your side. I wait. I'll rise up like the eagle and I will soar with you.

Just want to take a moment to say I love you, Lord. How we love you, Father. Hallelujah. Be with each one as we go, Lord. Be with those that are staying and worshiping, Lord. May this holy presence just move with us through this week, Father. We commit ourselves to you. Aresh, Lord God, how we love you, Father. In Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah. Those that want to be dismissed, welcome to do so. We'll sing a few more songs. If you want to stay, you're welcome to do that as well. Just go reverently as those that are still praying, thanking him for all that he's done. Amen. I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice to worship you, oh my soul. Rejoice, take joy, my king in what you hear. Let it be a sweet sound. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love you, Lord. Oh, say I love you, Lord. And I lift my voice to worship you, oh my soul. Rejoice and take joy my king. one here. Let it be a sweet, sweet
