========================================

[Music] And I know the Bible says when you've done all that you can to stand, just stand. [Music] Oh, and I know that it's hard sometimes to look through these tear stained eyes and still see the scars in those hands. [Music] But just you keep this in mind when hope seems so hard to find that surely you've not reached the end. [Music] And when the whole world has let you down, Jesus, you know, he can still be found. And when you've tried it all, just look to him. [Music] Oh, look to him. for him. Only when sorrow makes lonely all the days when the night closes in. [Music] And he can vanish all your midnight. And he can call back the sunlight. [Music] So how will it look to him? [Music] Now I know that questions can't Lord. They can get so hard to understand. a thing. But I know someone. Oh, he knows it all. And his eyes see even that little sparrow fall. Yet he can hold back the sea with just one hand. [Music] He's so big you ride on the breeze that blows. Yet in your heart, the only one that knows the heartache and all the trouble you're in. Oh, and when life sings everything but good, [Music] remember him cuz he the only one that could. And if you don't dare, just look to him. Oh, and look to him for he only with sorrow makes lonely all the days. When the night close in [Music] and he can banish all your midnight and he can call back the sunlight. So how will it and look to hear? Oh to him for he only when sorrow makes lonely all the days when the night close in. Oh, and he can banish your midnight and he can call back to sunlight. So how will it look to him? [Music] [Applause]
