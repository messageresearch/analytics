she had a miracle given to her of a new kidney and it came from a candidate that was like the doctor said it couldn't be closer it was like an identical twin and she just she just said that um that she believed that the doctor would let her go home tomorrow and and uh she hadn't had fever now for 24 hours just waiting for the pl pain level to drop to a more manageable level and she said you know that um and I'm not sure about all these medical terms but just let me read it as she says it she says God is cradling that new kidney after all the pain meds antibiotics infection my GFR is higher today than it has ever been at 80 and the creatin is 87 this is an absolute 100% miracle for it to be so good after all the meds and infection I'm so thankful that we serve a living God who cares about our infirmities and paid the price for our healing amen hallelujah amen what a mighty God we serve amen we're so thankful and as she is streaming here tonight and listening into the service May the Holy Spirit go to her room and finish the work completely and totally amen you can play that song Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by just a moment we want to pray for a need tonight there is a it has to do with the ram roof family and um it was a brother by the name of Anthony basso they live in New York he passed away today from a heart failure it was must have been kind of sudden and not expecting but anyway there's a loss you know when we when one suffers loss we all suffer and so as this family is grieving tonight and dealing with their loss May the Holy Spirit just go to them maybe you in your life tonight you've got a need you got a situation you just want to reach toward the lord right now and say Jesus Don't Pass Me By come to my Pew where I'm at deal with my heart give me that consolation that I need to know that you're working on my behalf father in the name of Jesus as we bow before your throne of grace it is there we find help in our time of need Lord when we realize that you became a man that you might suffer as men do and that you could be a proper high priest that could be touched not some distant God who does not understand Humanity but you to make sure we knew that you understood you became a man and you suffered In the Flesh you bore our sickness Lord you suffered in your body so that when we come to you that we could say Lord you know how it feels and you know Lord about this one that has found lost this family I pray that you'll Comfort them as only you can and these hands that have went across this building tonight I pray the Holy Spirit will deal with him in a special way I know Lord there are prodal in this building tonight and that are listening in and I pray oh God you'll go to them in a special way may the angel of God visit them oh God and shake them and make them realize that there's better in the father's house that eating what the wines have been served I pray in the name of Jesus Jesus you just call your elect tonight to the attention of the word and God may you make it real to their hearts heal and deliver your children Lord May the healing Angel go through this building back and forth Lord dealing with hearts dealing with lives and drawing each one closer to you we pray in jesus' name amen amen amen as I said last night I want to say thank you for coming for being a part we heard a wonderful message last night and we were so blessed by Brother Tom Ray and thank you brother Tom and we so appreciate that it was such a blessing to us and it just you know strengthens our heart and our resolve when we hear the word priest and brother brother brandham said this he said I believe the church is beginning to hear the message beginning to understand it but friend listen we got to lay in the presence of the sun we got to be ripened our faith isn't right intellectually we're hearing the message that God has give us and seeing the signs that he has shown us and proving it by the Bible is there but all how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so he can bathe down then he went on to say and let me just paraphrase this part he says you know as we near that great time he spoke of the atmosphere of when he went beyond the curtain of time which is the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost he said must be the same here as it was there you see that's what we want in this building here tonight we want the same atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that is in heaven to be right here that causes us then to be in Heavenly places amen where Heaven comes down and Angels move Among Us and the spirit of God moves because when it moves demons has to flee sickness has to go death has to give way to the name of Jesus Christ I want you to believe with all your heart and let's do it more than just intellectually but let's enter into the spirit you pray tonight God let me receive this more than just hearing you know a nice sermon and it just occupying a moment or two of my life but Lord may make it real to me as brother Brandon said in why Christ speak he said I think any man woman boy or girl I think in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is is and so forth can never have a full Foundation until they have met that light that brings the word to reality I think no church in this practice no matter how intellectual or fundamental it might be that church cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is made known among the people and they see it's something they can talk to that will talk back to them that vindicates this written word I'll tell you tonight we've must be a people who knows who we are as we heard last night who speaks Heaven's language and understands Heaven's language and let the Holy Spirit move in your life tonight I want you to tune in with everything that you have now put everything else aside and say Lord as you're passing by I'm going to reach out and touch you I'm not going to miss my opportunity this is an opport Unity tonight we have our brother Michael Ray who's going to be ministering the word brother Michael has been a blessing many many places already used around the world and you know as I think about young men that are stepping up into the the realm of the Gospel you know I remember myself back years ago now preaching in my in my 30s I as I turned 30 years old began to preach conv conventions all over the United States and around and through you know through and and continue and I thought when I heard brother brandham say you know I believe there'll be young men that will rise up to take this message and sweep it to the coming of the Lord I thought I was that young man I was one of them young men but now there are other young men that are stepping forward and moving on the gospel is moving on let's move with it let him speak to you tonight let the supernatural be made known among us to you personally the Holy Ghost made real to your life where he speaks to you and you speak back to him come into the presence of that light as brother Michael comes tonight let's enter in with all our hearts Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he pass his well you will F he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry I by this [Music] your reach [Music] outou let's sing it again reach [Music] [Applause] out oh you he's not [Music] [Applause] [Music] to and [Applause] [Music] reach as he go amen did you come intended to do that amen my I just been enjoying the worship there in the back study and had to come out a little early cuz I Haden been part of it for a little while it's just a sweet presence here tonight we're just so privileged to be here I I'll leave you standing for just a moment because then it we'll go to scripture but uh you know I was here seven years ago when the building was dedicated the sanctuary and the church here was dedicated and that was the year that I first uh well the Lord changed my direction just a few months prior that so I'm kind of Linked In Time with your dedication is kind of equal to my time preaching but I remember I was in a photograph at a ban at a dinner or lunch we had and and somebody was a Minister's dinner and I was there I'm like I I'm I'm fresh I'm not even a minister yet I don't think I'd even preached actually and I just remember being really really uncomfortable in a big picture and I remember I was by brother Donnie Reagan said what am I doing here my I kind of have them same thoughts right now what am I doing here but it's just uh just an incredible privilege and and honor I know to be honest I'm a little bit feared of preaching here not out of fear but just a deep deep respect that I have for brother Tim am man your ministry brother Tim brother Timothy he's not here but mine he meant so much to us the congregation here has been a lighthouse that's what you're called but you have been that Ministry has gone around the world it's been such a lighthouse to us and my family personally even and so I really just deem it such an honor to stand before you I don't have anything to say I just pray he says something that's really all I care and desire tonight and so you know you might hear a few things you heard last night I was cringing in my seat I was loving it and I was struggling there a little bit I said Dad Mercy you know it's one thing to have a Runway it's another thing to have him take a plane right off me like well you just took the whole thought from me but it was a wonderful word wasn't it amen because it's true and so maybe tonight the Lord is uh maybe Desiring you know to sit down you know and maybe sometimes he just wants to repeat something as even butter Tom said last night you sometimes our our fathers you know would sit us down and they're going to say something to us and they repeat it it's not because they're losing their memory because they sit down there and they say I want you to hear this again and listen really close and so you like okay the first time I maybe caught half of it but the next time I'm going to catch it all maybe that's just what the Lord's Desiring tonight in a in a little bit of a way and so we come to hear from him and we're just going to just give him the rest of the night all right amen so why don't we turn to the scripture we're going to turn to Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes ver chapter 8 as want to thank the hospitality here is just incredible I I just can't thank you enough butter Timothy Tim sister Ruth and just all the and even a little bag in my on the bed when I got to the room and you know inside there was worther caramels I was like man they got me pegged they know all the details you would amen and so we're just so grateful to be part of this this is special where we have never really been here we have some very very dear friends here oh everybody here's a dear friend how do you differentiate but you know we've never had the opportunity to be here with the Spencers and the puits and like this is is just real special and uh so I deem it such an honor Ecclesiastes 8 I canel Thee to keep the king's commandment verse two and that in regard of the oath of God be not Hasty to go out of his sight and stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him where the word of a king is there's power I love that scripture amen where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto him what doest thou all right let's just extrapolate that in our minds where we're going amen we can even you know we can turn maybe to Amos 3 another maybe scripture we would know quite well Amos 3 turn to verse S all right Amos 3 and 7 we know surely the Lord God will do nothing but reveal us his Secrets unto his servants the prophets and verse 8 says the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord God hath spoken who can but prophesy amen why don't we just have a word of prayer Heavenly Father tonight we're so desirous Lord that you're you draw near to us Lord so near as we sang the song that we could read Reach Out And Touch You Lord as that little lady reached out and took a hold of your garment cuz she had such a need she did whatever it took to get to that position that you were in such proximity that all she needed to do was reach for your garment Lord if that could be the case for each and every soul tonight that Lord you could draw so close and Lord each heart would be so desires to reach out and touch you Lord that you could meet individual needs and desires deep areas and burdens of the soul and the heart that Lord you alone know for you know our secrets Lord you you know our deep areas Lord even those areas where when we pray it's it's but a groaning that Lord we can't even express it but you know that place so Lord I pray tonight you can just touch us you can move in our midst and you would speak to our heart in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may have your seats tonight I mean I want to take a little thought tonight I have I could go two titles my original title was when the king speaks and uh you can maybe see why I was having some weary uh thoughts there yesterday cuz butter Tom was nailing that but I was said I almost brought a second set of notes but the Lord made me forget so I didn't so therefore this is what I got just in case but I'm going to speak on a little subject You Pull and I'll try and and just let the Lord have his way amen we'll just relax that's what we're here for it's Friday night so nobody's going to work I bet tomorrow morning maybe those that have weird shifts but for the rest of us we're here for a good time amen so we're going to and then if I took a little bit of a secondary title if I wanted to I'm going to call it that's what they say okay that's what they say you know everyone in this world feels like they have a say on something especially in these days with social media everybody's got 18 platforms that they're going to say the same thing 18 different times because they need to make sure that everybody hears their say on the matter but you know when someone important or someone of of a certain level has something to say suddenly that statement because of their rank or their position it becomes profound you know it means something even more because there's some celebrity or something like that even some famous orchar we know over time you could just say A you could say a line you could say I have a dream and you know exactly or most people should know exactly who that came from other people would say well if I said Give me liberty or give me death I'm certain the Virginians and those on the you know around here should know what that means too right I know there's some Virginians here did I hear an amen from that that's right because they they're of some position position some stature and so you know when they said something it meant something it really had something to say or or certain quotations you know ask not what your country can do for you and you can finish the rest of it because that was done by a president here or we do we go to history class still okay well that was John Kennedy for you all right genius is 1% inspiration 99% persperation Thomas Edison famous things famous things because of of who they are right men are women today if they spoke something it's heated and people follow you know I bet you I bet you you know there's a lot of people they don't really care what your current presidential candidates are saying but if they say it they're going to follow it just because right it just just where humanity is gone right now but you know there's a much famous quoter in all of these people it's they you know so often life are placed up against what they say you know someone uses well they say you know it's it's some way to hide behind you know their own thoughts are hidden in some ambiguous group of people that kind of believe something but you know they don't really so what they say such and such or they say this is how it's supposed to be and so it's this strong illusion that someone of authority is a source all right it it's eludes that there's a many you know a large group of people that believe this way so so yet but if they're queried about who it is as well it's just they that's what they say about it well who exactly is that I don't know but they say it so it must be it right it must be gospel you know if you drink tea with lemon it'll protect you from catching a cold who said that I don't know they said it it must be gospel right eight cup hey a lot of little a lot of sisters here drink eight cups or more of water a day because it's it's healthy for you who said that I don't know they did so it counts that's right yeah how many things that they say that you believe you're like well I don't know Google it who's Google it's I'll tell you that right now it's exactly who it is it's it's an algorithm yeah so when you go to Google and switch to Bing or whatever it's just they that's who you're believing they said it you believe it yeah well you know you swallow five spiders in a lifetime they say right right is who has anybody here swallowed a spider in the middle of the night and you're like no probably not but they say you do at least five so they are the most famous I would say more famous quoter than any of the prior ones and any any other ones you know I know my daddy he was told you know you can't after eating you can't go swimming for like 30 to 60 minutes cuz you get sick who said it they did and after time they're like you know what it's wrong who said that they did you get my point and I'm just overwhelmed actually how many people will actually take an opinion because somebody with some two- bit knowledge has really come up and they have zero Vindication on anything but they said it so it must be true I'm sorry this just not the case who's your Source they's my source you know my goodness we had a climate activist named thunberg who was like 15 and because she sailed across the ocean she became the authority on climate change why and and it all trickles down suddenly and we can't have plastic straws in Canada because they killed the turtles why because they said it it's like dear goodness it's true I come down the states to have a plastic straw I'm so happy yeah thank you it's a simple things in life oh my but you know that's the natural just to set a little bit of foundation that's the natural realm they say a lot of things you know but you know you can get into the into the spiritual I should say even the the Realms of of where we believe and I even heard I heard a statement just in the last few days or last week and and someone said you know now the going thing is you know can flirt and then convert you know we can just go out there and flirt with the world and then maybe we'll convert them and then we'll you know marry them who said that they did that's your Source I can tell you this didn't this don't say that you know we can get buy with an emotional experience oh it's okay to trim my hair it's okay to dabble in music it's okay to do this it's okay to do that and really at the end of the day who says that who really said that someone's trickling down and you want to get get back to it it's it's they that said it and Satan loves that broad just that broad statement you know painted with a big brush it denotes the crowd so we're okay I really don't care about the crowd I don't care the majority amen God if you look into your scripture majority didn't matter if you following majority you actually were on the wrong side of the table you really wanted to find yourself on the minority side I wanted to be with Elijah all alone on Mount Carmel I want to be with Mya there when in Jehosaphat I want to be all alone with them that's who I want to be identified with not the majority I can tell you not with the they oh sir so there's two sides there's what they say and there's What God Says amen Jesus said now heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away so Joshua knowing that his word must rest upon God's word he put God's word first wish you wish you sick people here tonight would do that because now there's what God says there's what they say and then there's what you say okay and you get a choice of where to go along that line and brother Bram said put God's word with your confession put your confession you believe it set it out there and call those things which are not as though they were amen so you're going to choose tonight where are you going to put your confession or your words are you going to go with they and what they say or you going to go with what God's word said no matter the cost amen you know I wonder what Noah would say if we were standing with Noah and we said you know Noah how did it go with you back when you were were starting the days when God spoke to you I could imagine if if we if we had an interview with Noah we went up there even had a microphone and said you know what what what what did they say you know well I Noah what do you say about the matter we're going to interview Noah a little bit and say Noah what exactly was was well they told me that there was they don't even know what rain meant you know they said there was not even any moisture in the sky in fact they said I was I was completely delusional as I was trying to tell them that God spoke to me and then that doubter said what really they said a flood what even is is that where's all the the water going to come from and so I had the I even preached I preached for 10 years and 20 years and to 30 years and they said Noah when are you going to be done I I really can't stay here any longer you're preaching the same gospel all these years in fact our message hasn't changed you haven't changed with the times Noah they said You Know This is oldfashioned Gospel I gotta go they said you're losing it Noah they did he said I was really losing my touch after 100 years preaching the same thing he said really we're out can't hear you can't stay here any longer what else did they say no well they put Rockets up into the air they told me there was no moisture they told me I was crazy they said my message was too tough they said that they told me that you know it so restrictive that all I had to do is was I had to go in the ark I had to I had to go in a place of safety but really I could I had my own ideas or I wanted to weigh a little bit and and they and so they they kept telling me it's it's too strict a gospel no it's it's too oldfashioned you know that I got to wear my my dresses and and conduct myself this way and and act a certain way I couldn't really follow certain certain music Trends and entertainment Trends I just didn't like it so they they they said they're out wow Noah you dealt with the naysayers huh I sure did but Noah what did God say well he told me that there was going to be a flood and I needed to build an ark okay any more details well he gave me a little bit of details on how to build it but that's about it you said there's going to be a flood and I need to be in the ark seriously no is there any more can you expand on what God Said there no that's all I got amen you mean you just got a few little lines from God and then you just followed in it I did because he said it therefore I believed it Noah come on expand the word for me a little bit more give me a little bit more what God Said all he said was there's going to be an ark and I had to be it or a flood and I got to be in the ark so what did you do Noah I believed it contrary to what all they said yes because he said it therefore I believe [Applause] it it's where you got to be can you imagine preaching for 120 years can you imagine that brother Tim stood at this Pulpit for 120 years and preached the same thing get in the ark oh man how many would be here 120 years from now every single single one of you because the seed inside of you will anchor you to that Pew and say Yes better Tim I believe it I'm get it in the ark because that's what my soul's crying for amen hey you got to put yourself there don't be like well I don't know after 120 years you would still be here because you're already here Amen brother said what you are today you would have been that day so if you're still here today after pressure after this after that after what they say you're still here you'd be there too amen hallelujah I don't care what they [Applause] say well Joshua Caleb can I give you can I interview a little bit tonight sure what would you like to what would you like to ask me well I'm really interested in the time when you went to when you went and spied the land and you went across into the promised land and Moses sent you across to have you come back and bring us back some evidence yeah yeah that was a wonderful time man me and Joshua were just so on fire as we came across we are carrying the grapes my goodness them things were like graef fruits and we couldn't get way to get back and say get a taste of this Amy man you got to dig into this word you got to get in this message look what's coming our day a gospel message to take us out of here wow what happened Caleb well we got back we started to tell everybody how amazing it was what did they say well you would have thought they got on board but they said the cities are too big they said there was Giants in the land that were too tall too Valiant too Mighty they said we're too we're small like little grasshoppers they said we can't do it seriously yeah of all the nerve in fact they even agreed that the land was beautiful they actually even said it was nice they they agreed that there was such lovely things milk and honey but you know what they said they threw it back in God's face and said we can't do it can you imagine God had promised them to land he said I'll take you there he' already brought them out of Egypt through the Red Sea plague upon plague he'd been already providing away and then they went over they get some evidence say sorry our God's not great enough he's not able they said our God is essentially weaker right he's lesser than the men of earth that's what they essentially said when they said we are not able and when we put doubt on God's word our land and say well I'm just struggling doubting there no no no no no no no don't do that because you're throwing God's word back in his face saying he's not able you're telling me that the king of glory is not able to take you into the promised land after he already brought you out of Egypt that's what they said how wow Caleb I mean you know what had even happened I I'll just tell you this a little bit but we went even down we were trying to trying to tell them you know and they even wanted to Stone me they turned against word of the prophet and then tried to kill me oh really you mean they turned against the message of the hour you mean they they went right against what Moses had been preaching the word of that day and they wanted to Stone it and kill it and and kill the life that you had that's exactly right weren't you one of them well looks like there was a dividing line looks like there's a dividing line oh yeah that's right well Caleb what did God say he said go and possess it he's said I can hear Moses even now telling us about the land filled with milk and honey and I can tell you the first time that I heard the message I mean the first time that I heard Moses speak about what was in that land well the first time I dug into the message the first time I saw serpent seed the first time I saw the opening of the word I tell you I couldn't wait to get there oh my heart was Surge I was putting my sword in my Bel already my shield was on my arm saying when Moses when can I get there because my God said and I believed it amen and we believe [Applause] it what what exactly did you say Caleb I believed it and I still believe it can we skip up a little bit let's just come back to Caleb a little while later cuz Caleb had to walk his way around the Wilderness for a little bit of time he had 40 Years of wandering in the wilderness can you imagine with people that had murmured the whole time and he's waiting this whole time I can't get across because they doubted you know what no he didn't get all mad and Dy and and upset and then cranky and all that but he just kept going I can I will I do believe I can I will I do believe Moses this and Moses that this and that I can I will I do believe I believe this time believe I don't know but this right this this I can't I will I do believe I don't care what they say whatever they say I believe it amen that's the people we are when he spoke it we believe it Hallelujah my Caleb I'm enjoying this interview with you a little bit can you talk to me a little bit more I sure can because I'm now 85 where's the time gone come on we got some soldiers here that are 80s and 85 and even I got a granddaddy this 90 and I can tell you if he could he'd be saying I can I will I do believe and I'm stronger in my faith now than it was when I began and Caleb said now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and five years since the Lord spake and he said and yet I'm as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come back in man this was a warrior now what else do you say Caleb give me my mountain man what that moment was when he threw his sword in his Scabbard for the for the last time and to the first time to get out there you know he probably was prepped every is this the day no is this the day no Joshua give me my Mountain all right Caleb it's time oh my that was Jubilee moment come on boys we're going to slay some Giants come on boys and girls come on brothers and sisters tonight let's go slay some Giants cuz I'm a Caleb you're a Caleb that's my identification in this gospel word give me my mountain how about Abraham I'm just going to give you some simple scriptures you heard it all this time years and years and years I'm just going to tell you again what's in your word what's in your land Abraham consumed himself with the king's words Abraham didn't have this I've got a down day I'm struggling I need a Psalm oh Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all you lands and your heart starts to Rejoice a little bit no Abraham didn't get to do that Abraham maybe if you burned into some leather what the Lord told him your seed be as the Sands of the shore seed Sands stars in the sky maybe just wrote some key down put that in his pocket and when he got little down he pull it out that's what my God said it's been five years Abraham where's the baby come on man you're getting old they keep saying that you're you're you're dried and withered up Stars s my God I don't care what they say you telling me Abraham that Sarah your wife's going to Bear a son H do you see how old she is star sand that's all he had he had a few words of God but it anchored cuz all he cared about is what he said what the king said he spoke to him and said don't worry Abraham I'm going to produce a son from your loins and your seed will be as the stars of the sky and the Sands of the seashore so don't you fret [Applause] I wonder if it got so faded just I have to reburn that in there losing the word stars because I keep rubbing and it's precious to me amen that's what he did he continually kept the king's word before him maybe you need to write a certain scripture down maybe you got some situation in your life maybe God's your healer and you need a healing you need to write that down you just going keep revisiting it it's okay devil they say it's impossible sorry sorry he's the god that Health all all all all my diseases that's my God you keep rubbing that in your pocket a little bit when they come up and say to you something that's negative to what the scripture said and he stagered not but grew strong amen stagered not of the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God but Abraham they had a lot to say I know they said it was impossible to have a baby at my age they said you know Sarah's Barren forever no chance to have a baby but Abram had them few words few little words and he kept believing it he just kept believing it have another I'm going to jump I'm going to pause on Abraham and we'll come back to him a little bit later but you know what I wonder about in our own midst tonight what they have said to you how many people have heard they say it's impossible situation how many they says have you got better Ron they said you're not going to live past how many months yeah four months they said that they said that they said it's impossible they said ain't going to there's no way it's going to leave you they said a lot of things there a lot of medical technical terms that they said sister Lanta buts what did they say they said that you weren't going to get healed they said a lot of things they say a lot of things contrary to this they say but Tom there ain't no way you and sister Jan going to have any kids they say it's impossible they say that you'll never see your son or daughter they say they've gone too far in sin they say your situation is too impossible they sa come on what did the devil say and all I hell all of Hell says all the time you're never going to make it you think you as a little sinner Reed are going to make it in heaven they say that you have no hope you've tried you spurn your last day of Grace that's what hell said but my God my King has a different story when the king speaks Everything Changes May the king speak tonight I don't care what they say brother Andrew God says you're a more aable and a conqueror Hall God's anointed you to carry this gospel who cares what they say run hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said when a lion roars who shall not fear when God speaks how can we keep from prophesying how can we keep from it when God speaks the prophet cries out the spoken word and the lion roars The Beatles everything he says they got enough sense the audacity and the honor to to honor their King when he speaks he said so God speaks by his word let every creature of creation take heed he is speaking in this last day he's putting forth his word let every creature that belongs into his kingdom take heed of what he's saying stop check up he's roaring now [Applause] how roaring by his Vindicated word he's making himself known when he Roars in these last days let's take heed and how and know that there's something fixing to happen knowing that God never does that without first he Roars when he Roars forth then something follows the [Applause] roar when God speaks something follows he's speaking tonight so something's [Music] following he's speaking to you something's following who is this one this great lion well lift up your heads oh your Gates be lift up ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory who is this mighty roaring lion that's crying out and roaring I tell you the Lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle therefore Isaiah 52 my people shall know my name therefore they shall know that in that day I am he that to speak behold it is I okay Isaiah 59 as for me this is my Covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayth who the Lord from hence forth and forever so now sorry where was the king's words you heard it last night like I said you're here it again in thy [Applause] mouth okay I'm just going to give it an example or two on what happens when the king himself speaks there was a moment in scripture when the king walking in flesh came into a household that had a very sick man or I should say he got word of a very sick man Pastor your friend Lazarus sick all right what did he do he kept going he ignored him you would say that's right you would say and he didn't come in fact Jesus turned his back and didn't even come someone say well you you you walk this Faith how long have you been in this gospel you mean you believe this message for how many years God hasn't met your need what kind of God is that I mean really come on Lazarus was a close friend I mean wouldn't he call come on Master come come he he's he's dying did he did he acknowledge that he was coming no no he actually just turned and they kept going you mean he didn't even turn around you mean you've 20 years you've been in this message you've had a situation and God hasn't answered your prayer what kind of God is that let back up forget this I've been in this message so long God has even heard my heard my prayer no that's not what they did all right in fact he went many day few days went by Lazarus passes away and now he's been even four days and finally Jesus says we need to go back he speaks to his disciples we know the story for sake of time we're not going to go into it but now the king himself has turned around because the appointed time that he knew was on the scene amen you don't know the appointed time but he does and I know you know the song when he's 4 days late he's still on time and you need to pocket that in your heart and say Lord I don't know but I've been holding on to your word for a long time and I'm just waiting for the moment when my king steps on the scene maybe it's tonight when he said it's all good you waited long enough but tonight I'm here he walks into the midst of Mary and Martha and now he starts to take control of the scene and the word steps now into the room or into the moment now and oh my goodness I can imagine all the different things that they said to Mary and Martha many many things that they said but that wasn't the concern Mary and Martha found themselves at the feet of Jesus and said even now even now you can take control of the situation even at this moment tonight in this service Lord I don't know what's going on before and all the past time but even now that's the heart of a Believer say Lord even in this moment you can raise up my son you can raise up my daughter you can catch a hold of my son that's gone L even [Applause] now why because the king had just stepped into the midst they just saw a lowely man of Galilee but it really was the King of Kings if the world could just have caught that if the world could just catch it you know those events now started to transpire and there was nothing any devil could do to stop it there was no Force when he said roll back the stone and every Demon's like what's going on something's happening down in the Tomb of Lazarus I don't really quite understand it because I don't know if they're all really figuring out who is actually there themselves because if th be the son if thou be if thou be he was wondering devil was wondering and like what's this going on he just rolled back a stone on a dead man yeah something's out of place push the stone back boys I'm sorry but if every demon in Hell had tried to get that stone back into place nothing could hold that stone nothing would shut the door because the king had said roll back the stone I'm telling you tonight the king is in the midst and he's saying roll back the stone yes sir somebody that's dead is about to come alive throw back the stone I've stepped on the scene tonight in Louisiana and I'm saying roll back to Stone because I'm here I'm here to speak and when I [Applause] speak brother Brown says in other words it must be fulfilled at the word of that God has spoken must be fulfilled God cannot say anything without having it fulfilled when he has spoken it it's a finished work work it's already finished when God speaks it God never speaks until he's ready to for it to be and when he speaks it's just as well already happened now if that wouldn't give us a basis to put our faith on this morning when God speaks our word it's already finished and what about his promises that he has given to us come on he said so therefore when we receive the word into our heart it's already done what a moment when the king then said Lazarus come forth you know everything was dead still for a few seconds oh yeah as all creation went in harsh who just spoke I tell you that rippled through every Dimension the shock waves of that word that's right hold it and then out comes this clothed WRA white grave clothed human being hey I'm sorry but it was quiet no longer that's right for a few moments as it was a hush who just spoke then they figured out pretty quickly the king just spoke because no one else can speak and allow those words to cross over into another dimension mention and drag his Spirit back into a body raise him off the stone table and bring him out I can tell you he wasn't walking like this some Supernatural Force started to move him out the door then he said loose him and let him go so that Reet could get praising and walk in and say guess what my king spoke amen hallelujah that's our God whose word word can cross into other dimensions and penetrate into your realm and complete the [Applause] promise don't belittle the power of the word Abraham by speaking the word and staggering not at the promise I imagine as he was pondering as we talked about and he would Ponder the words that God had told him he would be speaking the word and I can imagine as he would Ponder he'd be speaking it and telling Sarah Sarah this is what God told me Sarah this is what God said he said you're having a baby he said it's going to happen and Sarah was just receiving that she was hearing it Faith cometh by hearing the word of God like I said Abraham didn't have this but he had to speak and he pondered and he let that word mold and he'd speak it and Sarah would hear it and she also would start to ponder the word you know what it started to do you know when the word leaves your lips it's disturbs the air and it creates waves and these waves go boom and they hit your ear hits the eard drum creates some vibrations and your brain interpretat interprets those little little electrical signals boom and you hear amazing why because word went into the air you didn't see it but it did there's power in that word that came forth out of my lips how much more if my words can penetrate at a around you cannot see and land on your ears to Dingle a little eard jum how much more the word of God send some Shock wve into another dimension but Abraham's words but Bram says before when that old body that she had the first body had had to be changed in order to produce a son he says you get it the body couldn't do it so it'll have to be changed and the words that Abraham would have kept bringing and speaking and I don't know when but at some point something started to take hold because Sarah's body started to [Applause] change she had been young already when the eloh Elohim came and said at the time of life appointed you're going to have a baby she had to already be capable of a baby she wasn't 95 well all right in N9 months I'm going to have a baby no so something had started to already starting to change because of the word that they had been fellowshipping on oh yeah there you go and at some point the first change happened right oh Sarah you lost a wrinkle no ter oh yeah I'm sure of it you know you look straighter you look a little bit more straight there uh Abram you sure yeah you're you're not quite you know really hey it's starting to take hold yeah and you know what that did PA ignited the faith and then they kept walking into it and walking into it and then the promise started to arrive and her body started to change why because a voice From Another Dimension actually started to penetrate say where's the quat for that well B says now in this room I got to shed the coat cuz tugging on my microphone thank you bu BR says this room now is coming human beings forms of human beings passing through here all around voices singing in this room right now but you see you are only limited to your senses to a certain per of sight but you can take a crystal and a tube and a television so forth and he says you can condense it and you can start you could bring those signals to manifestation he said that are HID from our eyes the same thing is passing through here now he said and so is God here and the angels and someday it'll be just as much reality as television or anything else and so the word has been here all the time amen it just required a vessel at a specific season to be able to receive it for that certain hour Sarah and Abraham were the vessels of that moment when that word was spoke said Abraham you're going to have a son and it hit a vessel Works hit a certain vessel and it started to change it hence a word in this day was spoken the voice of the king echoed in this hour to what to hit and penetrate some beings here and start a [Applause] change what is it it's the Thundering of the king and I'm just so thankful I got the little receiver that's ready to receive how grateful I am for the grace of God what about um um you heard last night about gyrus you know man my dad opened up and Jus I was like Dad you know what forgive my carnality that's just God actually telling you he actually I tell you my dad and I talk oh NADA no no nothing okay just in case somebody here like yeah yeah they they chat a little bit you know comparing no so where you going huh to telling your service sorry I'm just removed that cality right out of here because that'll stop you from receiving what God actually has for you demon of Doubt demon trying to oh that's just man it ain't just man it is God that's placing those different subjects do you know how many verses are in the scripture Lord where do you want me to where do I go what's your leading what's your mind I mean come on come on just tell anywhere Lord just this scripture you know certain message whereever anything know and and and the same scriptures the same I have the same quote that brother Tom preached last night the exact same one oh come on yeah I had to wrestle through that okay so I'm just telling I'm just preaching myself right now yeah preachers get preach to too even by themselves gyrus placed in a position and I can say you know gyrus he was there he came to the master and he was needing a real move of God he was trying to get there and if you want to go into the scripture you can actually read where gyrus there was the people were thronging and he had been actually already listening to the words of Jesus and he was you know almost a bit of a secret believer really and so but he was in the midst of the Pharisees and the scribes and and he was hearing a lot about what they said about it be he's a fortune teller he's of the prince of the Devils he don't believe nothing what he's doing he just a bunch of a bunch of hypnotism and he heard a lot of theya gyus heard a lot about what they say I don't care what realm you're in someone hearing a lot about this and a lot about that and believe sign that and this that and the other there's a lot of they say but gyus something inside something's right there there something true about what he's speaking and so he's kind of silently going along but then gyrus had a need in his house something hit home H God can cause something to happen because he's needing to drive you to the feet of the master and so he allows a certain circumstance to pull you from what they say to what he says here's dyus and he's getting pulled into the crowd cuz now he's a little bit desperate so gyus now is is walking through the crowd and and if if if you turn to it I don't have we'll try and save time so I won't do that but here he's walking up to Jesus he's trying to get there and just as he gets there he's trying to get there a little lady presses through that's right and stops the situation that's right okay and in that span of time he's like he's trying to get there and now a little lady's gone through she's touched the H of His Garment and now everything is changed and he's there and she she she gets Jesus deals with her kn focuses on her attention gyrus was there and now everything delays and in that moment a messenger comes and gyrus she's dead don't don't bother the master it's no use scripture says while he yet spake he's talking to Jesus now to the lady Jesus now dealing with someone else's need he's turned his attention away and he meets her and while he's speaking to her her news comes your daughter's dead don't trouble the master now sometimes you might feel that way it's like God's attention just turn somewhere else you're like Lord what what about me I've got some great needs don't trouble him no more your need is actually hopeless he can't do it anymore you're your daughter's far far gone your daughter's dead you know what the next verse says in Luke chap 8 verse 50 I love it it says but when Jesus heard it oh he's looking at the lady with the with the knee to touch His Garment the blood issue I think it was and she's there and and suddenly gyrus is over here sorry your daughter's dead you just don't bother the master but Jesus heard it there you go situation no good what sorry you think Jesus is here in your need you forgot me Lord no no no no his ear heard gyus conversation don't trouble the master the ear of God reached into that little conversation the ear of God reached into your little home tonight reaching your little home this morning and he listening to what you're praying and what you're asking for the burden of your soul even the Deep groaning of your heart the ear of God is present in your hour of need and he was listening fear not fear not believe only believe only and she shall be made whole wait a second who just spoke who just spoke the king just spoke uh she's dead jarus what are they saying you're say impossible who is this one that thinks he can raise the dead you're still following him jyrus you even think that you believe a little bit what he's saying he's gone crazy he's gone nuts fade away from him leave him right now this message is is false forget it come on buddy I don't understand exactly gyus so let's go oh it's something something there come on gyus where you going to go what they say what you he just said they say he just said know who I follow at the moment Jesus coming over everybody said oh J your little girl's dead father Jus oh we're so sorry for you he said keep still he was speaking about Jesus you're making too much noise with all this tal and here going on he said you're hollering you're screaming he said when they did that when they heard him say that she wasn't dead they said they laughed him to scorn as you heard the scripture last night are you serious gyrus brother Bram says they booed him why you false Prophet you deceiver of man the girl's Dead who are you to say that she's going to be alive boo I know another another boo they laughed him to scorn he's a false prophet it's a false message don't you dare follow this they said Char you've been talking to him now what about it but the king had spoken right and gyrus needed do a revelation of who had just spoke so in that moment something fired he had been just listening maybe maybe he'd been drawn to it for a little while he he'd been to a sermon here a sermon there and something was just kind of tickling his soul but at that moment when the king spoke something dropped into his soul and said I don't care what they say he just said my daughter will be well so I'm following the word but it was a revelation to him of who that was amen it sure had to be they said well she's dead he said no she's asleep she's dead as ever no he said she's going to be well your son will never come back no the word said he can go get her your your sickness your disease it's incurable they said my mom would never be healed they said it's impossible no the word says it can [Applause] and he took the damsel by the hand as you heard last night how many gyus is here this morning this evening put yourself in the scripture don't just read Luke 8 and Mark 5 oh that's a good story brother Michael thanks for telling you into a little detail no no no no who's the gyus tonight that the revelation of who this word is in this hour would drop in your heart and you would say no devil my situation is whole my son is as good as here my daughter is as good as he my husband my wife my situation it's as good as gone because I believe the King has spoke to me he has right here and in the message of this hour the King has thundered out a message that can meet our every need yeah he said and I can see him look around to gyrus and say you still believe oh he's poking now you still believe yes Lord Brother Brown quote yes Lord he said and he proved his word she was only asleep he regardless of their unbelief he still proved his word was right God will always prove his word he's obligated to prove his word cuz if he said it he'll deliver on it amen you know this word said there'll be a bride in this last day amen you believe that but BR says but in obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride the person here they here off somewhere else some other Church some other de denomination whatever it is in some not believes the word of God obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed she is watching for it she's part of that word and she's watching for her life to manifest the word why she's hear the voice of the king and she's waiting for the manifestation ripening in the Sun as we heard before the service waiting for that word to manifest in this hour that's Brethren can't you see it I hope that didn't go over you the body is waiting which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to come firm or make it alive that's what she's waiting for no other life will work in her she can't come to the life any other way she feels it out there she knows it's going to happen there here it happens she awakes up God said let there be and she came forth like first one to come forth if he said there's a bride in this last day if he spoke it if he said it's going to happen nothing can stop the seed for manifesta manifesting in this hour nothing no sir some choke some sputter at it they can't handle the potency of the message of this hour that's fine they heard hey you heard some quotes last night that would churn some people's minds to butter but not bride not bride amen they swallow it because that is actually what feeds them brother BR says he says the holy when we've got the power of the Holy Spirit but we got to come back to the word to feed the machine we can't feed it on Creed it burns it it chokes up on the flues it won't burn it he said it was made for the word of God I love a potent word I love a strong gospel cut and dried black and white I don't want so NY pami Social Gospel I want a word sin cutting devil killing gospel and its message to bring you and I to full manifestation oh you say brother Michael this word pretty heavy I don't care it's what makes you and I R to life if your machine's wanting something a little bit more water down low octane I'd get on your knees I'm going to tell you wow just looking at my clock I'm being good you know Jehoshaphat said you know when God speaks his word when the king speaks he don't never forget okay when he speaks his word to you and anchors deep down you say you know what God just spoke to me he said such and such he's revealed that to me he's healed me he's delivered me he's met my situation now you just wait for it because God never forgets okay God's not a god forgets I can Jehosaphat there sat at a time but brandom goes through it I'll just try and paraphrase here and he was there when they called from Mah he was with Abra Ahab and and they were they were in a battle and they were want to get you know word from the prophet well they had all the prophets that they they had out there and and he said well is there another one you know joh we know the story and and Ahab of course you he doesn't like the prophet he always says something that that I don't like to hear and he speaks against me and they ended up bringing him down well they said they sent a runner out there to get Micaiah he said you know I got to put a bug in your ear now he said you say the same thing that they say this is the runner telling the prophet what to say you just say just like they say because I tell you that all 400 of them ecclesiastics is saying we should go this way so you just must say the same thing come on messenger you're going to have to say what the rest says you're just going to have to fall in line with with what the rest of denominations are preaching forget that serpent Seed doctrine forget being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if you can just fall in line with what they all say then everything will be all right oh M said as the Lord God Lives I'll just say what he puts in my mouth there's a prophet for you there's a minority yep sorry I like that he said I like it uhhuh amen one Prophet to another he said so they brought him down there Ahab was having a raging spell and get that Holy Roller among us down here now he's going to ruin our congregation and so he's all you know spewing some different some harsh words there and he said I'm going to go he goes I'm just going to Micaiah said I'm going to stay right with the word so M he saidwell should I go up he says well give me the night to think about it I'm going to go talk to the Lord he says all right so then he comes back he says how long though will I say just tell me the truth now you know he he actually got a word back you don't go up there oh wait a second that sounded too easy it's not quite like you Ahab actually had a de bit of sense he said well go on up but I saw Israel scattered his sheep all right so we know this here we know this account that this is what Mah said to them and he said you know he was staying but says with the word of God he said so Micaiah he said so what could Micaiah say any different because he said so because Elijah the prophet had already prophesied so years before a word had already been issued out on Ahab Ahab you're going to die so here you say you're going to go up you're going to prosper not M couldn't say anything different than what the word had already stated God had not forgotten of what his Prophet had said and so M now comes and said sorry but I see you scattered his sheep because he said Mah could not say anything different about what the word said and so here something transpires and God remembers what he said way down the road behind in history and just some a little lonely Little Soldier man just threw up his bow into the air as the scripture says on a venture and God's word that had spoken by a prophet took hold of the Venture arrow and brought it to where Ahab because God could not forget the word that he spoke by a prophet and took a random Arrow in the air and said sorry I have but your dead man if God could remember that do you not think he remember every single promise in that book every word you just think well I got to say a prayer tonight I'm just going to it you on a little word oh God you think it's a ventless prayer but it's not because the word grabs a hole brings it down into your heart Hallelujah God don't Venture God don't forget he remembers you when you get down on your knees say oh God I have a certain situation you think well does he hear me yes he does he remembered when Mah got out there said sorry I can't say nothing different God said I remembered I remember my word that I said way back there thousands of years ago it still applies [Applause] today it applies right here Lord Hallelujah I don't care what Ahab said A Higher King had spoken oh my ain't no 50-50 chance and ain't no sing Russian rouette no he spoke it he means it he delivers it you just need to keep walking I can I will I do believe that's all God desires of you and that's all he desires he does not require your understanding your merits your abilities your talents he don't care about nothing he says just believe you know not everybody here's the Roar of a king as we said a little bit ago scripture said you know if everybody did then I'd have to wonder why are they not following the King's word you know if you didn't follow the king's word he was treason you know if you're going against the king I wonder how many people are committing spiritual treason in this day and hour spiritual treason was punish punished by death spiritual treason carries the same sentence we don't want to be against the word of God but so the devil clouds and if you don't have the little the seed inside you're not going to hear the king anyway John 12 says but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him they had done many miracles so the sight of Miracles didn't change anything hey how many people saw the Miracles on brother bram's day thousands thousands did it do anything no for many it didn't do anything s so the scripture says yet they believe not that the saying of Isaiah the prophets might be fulfilled which he spake Lord who hath believed our report oh but there's a people it said when the king speaks I believe it but you know people don't go back to the source they they get told something they hear that they say and how many I wonder are content with so many they says about this message don't even go back and look for themselves you know many people come in they say oh I heard this and heard that and whatever have you ever read a message no end of story go read the message then we'll come back and talk don't even waste your words you know but not everybody you know was running to e to Solomon either if I could say it that way I don't think everyone was really eager to hear his voice but there was one that was eager many came many heard they heard what did you hear this I heard this happen here they said this is happening in the court and this they had all a whole lot of things but there was one little lady who said you know what I don't care what you say I need to go there for myself I actually need to hear it from my li his lips to my ear I need to go to the source on the matter because what you say and you say it's all different all convoluted but I got to get there so she got her camels and all her different things and she packed herself up and the queen of the South the word says shall rise up into judgment with this generation who and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon why because there were some that didn't all right some that didn't but she yearned I need one word I just need to get in his presence I need to hear what that word says amen have a great need have a desperate situation if the king could just speak to me all will be well everything will be made right just I need to get there and she was willing to get there and you know I was thinking you know I don't have time to even go there you know I was thinking about the two little mothers what wisdom Solomon had those was two little mothers that came there and said oh this is my baby no this is my baby and they saided both claiming the same baby because one had died and she said Each one was saying to the other one and so here it is is confounding this is in scripture you know just sitting there in the word you said well you know just no no no actually I was reading a little bit and I thought my that's actually kind of incredible because the word in that hour could discern the situation both were claiming to have life so close it would deceive the very elect if it were possible two Mas say no that's my baby no that's my life that's that's my know word word saying well just wait a second let's just divide it let's take the word and divide it and one was content for a watered down gospel for a lifeless word he was content to take it and say that's okay that's fine but the other one that was so that wanted it not the so close but the real true blue M she said no no don't I need that whole word I need everything I need from A to Z I need Genesis the Revelation I need the whole gospel don't cut it in half Solomon says you're the real one you're the one that has a seat inside of you you're the real mama amen we don't want to water down cut and half gospel we want the word from the king in this hour Hallelujah that's not just a story in scripture that's this day because there are people that do not care but not bride keep the life I need mechanics and Dynamics I need it all together I need that baby word to burst forth and cry out yes Hallelujah because there's a little Queen from the south South that believes every word and rise up she has rose up so I can tell you there's a little Queen here you'll fellowship with that Queen of the South because this queen of the South says we believe to we got to the feet because a greater than Solomon came in our day we're Ken we're both from the south amen you know the little Queen has a special position because a queen is given Authority a servant is not given Authority just a soldier little private down there they have certain duties but the queen is a different story and it it's really embarrassing when you presume Authority I don't know if anybody's ever been in them situation when you know you step a little bit above your pay grade or you're you know see somebody it's like oh I'll just step out of the Zone it's kind of awkward when someone presumes something steps out there he like hey bud and that's not your call oh he's like yeah I'm out of here presume is terrible to venture without Authority is what that is and brother Brown says presume he says I got the Webers says it's to venture without actual Authority or to take for granted amen and so often I'd say almost always the they Sayers are venturing without Authority they often step out there and they start to say something you're like do you even have a right to say that well they say it but no no you're venturing out there you're presuming because they don't have the authority but the queen has the authority and she's a queen because she's received the seed from the King yes the queen sits in that position she's received life she's been United with a king therefore she's Queen and now she sits at a ranking level and can utter out or Usher Authority a certain Vagabond Jew Exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits in the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adure thee by Jesus whom Paul preaches and they were seven sons of ska a Jew a chief of priests which did so and the evil spirit said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you that was venturing without Authority they presumed they had something inside of them that they could step out there and say I adure Thee in the name of the Lord Jesus they were speaking words so actually is it just the words oh but a life inside has to be present to bring the power behind it and that one there was saying I adure Thee had nothing inside so when he spoke the words the spirit said sorry but I know Jesus and I know Paul he is the king of kings he's filled with his life and his Spirit therefore speaks with authority but who are you that was a scary moment for him because scripture then says and the man whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so they fled out of the house naked and wounded you don't think the enemy knows oh he knows he knows exactly so there's no you be very careful you want to make sure there's life that's why being filled with the spirit of the Living God life inside of you is so critical because when you come up against the wall and you got to speak to the storm you want to know inside there's Authority that's why this message is so critical because this word of this hour is what is the life of this hour that is inside of you that can bring the power behind the [Applause] word my it's your identification this word is your identification so when you do and a spirit in that realm says wait a second I know this person oh not you because me and this word are tied together that's why I stand to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you need to be able to identify with the word of this day because that's who gives you that's where your Authority comes from but brand says watch him I like this how bravely how majestically he stood before his critics he said destroy this Temple and I'll pray the father and see what he does about it destroy this Temple and Rise it up in three days not I hope so not I'm going to try I will do it he says the same scripture right here yes sir that said he would raise up his body gives us the authority the power in my name they shall cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or deadly things drink deadly things they won't harm them and if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover if it raised him from the dead in three days is this word importent today come on oh I expected a louder Amen on that if the word raised up Christ from the dead in three days I repeat is it impotent today never because it's his word and he's a yesterday today and forever so there's Authority in his bride that carry the same word so he said lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's why this word thundered out I don't have time to go through it the Thundering of this word in this age is a king thundered out breaking the seals of this hour to what reveal himself to you and I amen it was the king speaking in this age not just a prophet it was the king through a prophet that's why this quote says that you heard last night brother Bram says as brother Tom red and I'm going to read it again because somebody here didn't hear it a momentary consideration of church history as he goes through he says they organized and again the pure word was lost for organizations tends to dogma and Creeds they could no longer speak for God they sent God that God sent Wesley he was the voice of the word in the day he the people took his Revelation from God became the living epistle read an knowable men for their generation Methodist failed God raised up others so it has gone on through the years until this last day there's again another people in the L who under their Messenger as you heard will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece if God it's its own mouth piece it's own mouthpiece he say well brother Michael um do you have scripture for that well I'm going to take you through a journey through a story that you know so well as we come to the near the end and it's a story in the Book of Esther all right we know the story of Esther and this little chosen Queen and she gets selected by the king and she was out to get destroyed by a demon devil and there she comes and and the and the King which had power by his word could issue out a Word of Deliverance but she had to come and surrender herself to the word of that day and she had to come before the king and surrender all her life and she had to go to the feet and she fasted and she prayed she trembled and she I don't know cuz if I go there I might die and she says the words of I perish I perish but I'm going to go before the king and and she walks hesitantly into the chambers the doors open open up and there the ler standing there in the whole crowd and the whole throne room just goes into Ash well she's insane she's going to die Esther goes through this process this gut churning dying time to go before the king and be presented before the word and the word gets extended to her and she's accepted that's right and then hmon she goes through the Banquets we know the story hmon is then destroyed and hung on the gall and it's like oh okaying take back the decree well I can't do that CU once I've spoken my word I cannot pull it back and the day you eat thereof the day you die or revoke it I can't I spoke it the decree went forth so he could not and so now Esther in the scripture approaches the throne as second time yeah and I'm so I I love the scripture because when she walks in in chapter 8:3 she's now walking knowing the king accepts her there's no fasting and praying oh my God Lord are you are you going to accept me do you know my need I just oh is he going to I got to go before the throne again fast and pray please because I no no no none of that actually exist she just walks into the throne open she knew she's accepted Hallelujah she knows she's accepted she don't need to hesitate she don't need to wonder is he going to hear my prayer is he going to accept me am I going to be dead before him oh no what is he going to know just walk in Esther just approach the word just say Lord I have a need I'm here he says Esther I just want to to come into my Throne Room how come you didn't come earlier how come you didn't get on your knees sooner I'm ready to meet your need cuz she was Queen and she knew it that's what God is Desiring for you to be Queen you you're Queen he's just waiting for you to know it and to actually stride into the throne room say I'm here King I have a need not disrespect but in position that's right and so now the king proclaims out a decree I can't can undo this first action so he puts out another decree can undo my law so the word of the King goes forth all the Demons of hell are given notice that a mighty conqueror has stepped on the scene risen up and the King now is coming and he's enabled the Jews to fight come on now that word has gone forth he raised from the dead he said hey I've been risen I've taken the keys of death and Hell In The Grave I've given you the power and authority go out there and fight sir yes sir so you now are armed all the Jews there are including the queen armed now to go forth and the word of the king and so now after this was all over the Jews had been defeated there was Joy or the Jews had defeated so many 75,000 actually and there was joy and rejoicing okay Esther n then Esther the Queen the daughter of Abel and Mori the Jew wrote with all authority not the king the king didn't write it the queen wrote with all authority oh my goodness to confirm the second letter of purum to let the Jews know the time of rejoicing is here true juilee has sounded and we have responded to our God why it was the Queen's authority to send out a message of this hour to distribute to translate to get it out to the people to say people we been called fight this gospel it's Jubilee hour and they sent letters unto the Jews to the 120 provinces around the world with words of peace and Truth who the queen that's right who the queen we got a part to play The King's decree transferred through the queen to the world we don't have time to sit down on our laurs we want to get out of here so Queen we got work to do we got to get out into our community into the country translating the gospel get it in the world so we can go home oh my but in this meantime it's Jubilee yes sir we're supercharged with the message of this hour what makes you tick the word what gives you the energy the [Applause] word verse 32 says and the decree of Esther [Music] oh my yes sir the decree of [Applause] Esther it wasn't her own words but she was speaking the king's [Applause] words Hallelujah but she had the authority that's right to give it up don't nobody say you can't get this word I won't go there this goel is free and this queen has the authority to give it out nobody TI the hands of no Queen say sorry you're not allowed I'm allowed I've been given Authority from the [Applause] king oh my goodness help me stop preaching Mercy well we're at the end here you know I usually have the musicians come up because then they pressure me to close that's what I do at home I forgive they got to forgive me oh my goodness yes indeed the king spoke the words been handed down that's why the word says that she takes the book and eats it and then she must prophesy again again it's not anyone else's words but the word from the king in the mouths of his people amen he said I am in you at that day what day whatam clearly says at that day that's this day that's what he said that's what your Prophet said that's what the king said when this Revelation is made known you'll know that I am the Father the father in me I in you and you in me oh my you've been raised for this purpose queen you've been raised raised for this reason God saved you for this hour he had a seed that he prepared in a people and you know I can imagine he just waiting I can't wait for that last stage I got a special group of people I'm holding him back and then I'm going to let him ra that's for you he's held you back to this hour he didn't put you in NAIA Ephesus age or Philadelphia age or smyna age this age this AG you're prepared for this hour for this moment man you hold a position you do queen you know David knew he was anointed brother Braham said that he knowed that they knowed he was a good shot let's just run with that they know that he knowed he was a good shot we're a good shot cuz this word is Bullseye accurate amen because David was anointed with the spirit of God yeah I can tell you it wasn't just David it was the anointing that David was under because brother Bram says David was anointed and we stood before Goliath he never cried oh God what must I do he knew it and he stood there he said you let the bear let me kill the bear let me kill the lion we know the story he said he spoke and went forward there's no need to cower and apologize for being the bride I'm going to say that again maybe that little armor girl that was getting her dress already she didn't apologize to all the cousins I'm so sorry he picked me I mean I know you're beautiful and all I'm just sorry I mean he looked at my complexion I sorry ah maybe I wish it could be you no she didn't you know I'm so sorry I mean you're not you I mean it could have been you I mean you're all so beautiful you chose me he chose me don't it look pretty look at the dress of this word do you enjoy oh look at this Christ the mystery God revealed look at it look at I'm Shaw with this word look at my veil oh oh the choosing of a bride oh sorry that's me I don't want to throw it out there but it's me she didn't get embarrassed with who she was David did not get embarrassed well I know I'm a good shot and I know you know but no come on get out and fight you going to question the king what doest thou uh anybody that ever did that died can you imagine going up to some King back in Old England what are you thinking what was I thinking you don't question a king how much more the King of Kings when he said I chose you I formed you before you were formed in the belly and before thou CEST forth in the womb I Sanctified you me yes don't question [Music] it I ordained you but the Lord said unto me you know what the scripture says actually then I said Lord God behold I cannot speak for I'm a child there's no here tonight but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak he says Be not Afraid of their FA for I am with thee to deliver Thee sayith the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand touched my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy [Applause] mouth hallelujah hallelujah musicians you got to come your pastor opened with why Christ speak hope you caught that why could I speak why could I speak why could I speak why could I speak why could I speak why could I speak why CHR I speak you think God's trying to tell us something just maybe he's telling us it's your time Queen it's your time Queen speak the word Moses spoke the word God he goes through it and we don't have time because I called him musician so now I got a time crunch I'm purposely done but brother Bram said the seed Moses born and then he was afterwards he brought to the place where he was anointed he said the seed laying there with an intellectual conception but with all the faith that he was born to deliver this people yet it never come to life until the light from the burning bush flashed across it until he seen not something he read about but something he seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it oh how that did bring things to life maybe tonight I tell you God spoke but now you need to speak back to him because it's a combination right he speaks to Moses Moses spoke back to him and butter brown him said it oh and then how did that bring things to life maybe you're like well I'm pretty dead it's okay we just heard Lazarus come from the grave because the king spoke so I don't care how dead you are 4 days 4 months 4 years 40 years I don't care but when the word spoke and you speak back to it Lord I need you what does it do it awakens life Joshua spoke to his son Samson spoke actually the scripture says to Samson it says actually he killed a thousand with the Jawbone and actually says and it came to pass when he had yet made an end of speaking oh while he was swinging he is speaking I have killed thousands he's swinging scripture says with the JW on of an ass heaps upon heaps demons upon demons that he's swinging and slaying he was speaking the word in action when Jesus met Legion and spoke but Braham says it wasn't Jesus crying he said it was the devil's crying tonight by Your Word you have the authority to make the demons cry tonight hallu I've done preached enough to tell Show You by this word in this gospel that it's in your being and so I hand it over to you maybe tonight you need something miraculous maybe it's
