you'll touch him tonight father may you just send your holy spirit after him lord touch him in his body minister to his needs father for the kinney camp lord in constant chronic pain god go to him right now lord on the very wings of this prayer under this anointing that we feel right here in this atmosphere god lord we know that we're free and he can be a part of that freedom lord god free from pain lord freed from the the things that are holding them back god may you just lose your spirit to him tonight lord we want to continue to remember sister ruth she goes into the hospital tomorrow for surgery and we ask dear god that you would guide the hands of the physician lord that not be the hand of a man father but may you come and you make the right cuts god and you remove all that is there father and may you just do as a skillful surgeon that you are and god may she have confidence may she have peace tonight knowing that her god is on the scene he's even here right now to send words of comfort peace father in the name of jesus we ask these things tonight now may you anoint the lips of your speaker father may not be the lips of a man lord but maybe look beyond the voice that is speaking and listen to the voice behind the voice tonight and may you just have your liberty father as i believe the people are here under an expectation now god may you meet that expectation tonight for we ask it in jesus name amen if you have your bibles tonight we'll have you turn to second psalms excuse me second samuel not second psalms y'all find that one let me know it does happen amen second samuel 22 and verse 31 i think we should be a church tonight that is excited for what god has just recently done in our young people maybe you don't feel what i'm feeling but i'll tell you what when you got a young person that's coming back changed it'll put something inside of you to make you shout hallelujah because you know you've prayed you've tried you've done everything you got and then you led but it took god and i believe tonight there's gonna be some families that can say my young person has come home different they come home changed they come home look they went into a battleground but they come home with a victory and it's up to us to foster that atmosphere it's up to this church to foster the victory tonight and we're not going to sit down on the word we're not going to sit out on the preacher we're not going to be like a bump on the law but we're going to cultivate an atmosphere of worship so that we can continue the battle so we can continue marching forward let them see a fight in us we find here as for god his way is perfect how many can say amen to that the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in him for who is god save the lord and who is the rock save our god god is my strength and power and he make it's my way perfect he maketh my feet like hein's feet and he setted me upon my high places notice david didn't exalt himself to the high places god set him there he teaches my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy gentleness gentleness had made me great thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not slip i have pursued my enemies young person i'm going to be speaking to you tonight this message tonight is directed to our youth and their return from the battle i have pursued my enemies and destroyed them notice they didn't destroy you we destroyed them and turned not again until i had consumed them and i have consumed them and wounded them that they could not arise yea they are falling under my feet for thou has girded me with strength to battle them that rose up against me that i have subdued under me that has also given me the necks of my enemies that i might destroy them that hate me they looked but there was none to save even unto the lord but he answered them not you know you got your enemy in a predicament when he's calling out to your god for help well but i want you to know they didn't your god didn't answer them then and he ain't going to answer your enemy today and he says i beat them down small as a duster of the earth i did stamp them as the mire of the street and i spread them abroad that's what you got to do with your enemy you beat them down and you bring them to dust and you just spread it all over the place [Applause] hallelujah you can have your seats tonight i'm a little excited i'm a little bit jacked up tonight oh my i believe we we i want to speak to you tonight on returning from the battle i don't think we got to return from the battle all down in the wowzy wilds and wolves all defeated and depressed and beat down and beat up no i think when we went to battle i think that's what we did this past week is we sent our young people into battle but i believe church tonight that the young people are coming home they're returning from the battle not beat down not destroyed not forsaken oh they've been persecuted but they're still standing looking young person you have fought a great fight but you're here tonight you're still standing when the devil said you weren't going to make it you're here tonight he said there was no use of crime you're here tonight see we look at these scriptures right here and we find david gives an overwhelming uh resound to the word of god or to god's praise and god's glory because see david knew what it meant to go to battle david didn't have all this to say about god because life was easy and life was a little bit you know he had everything that he wanted it was free from suffering and it was free from from pain but david learned to trust god in the struggles david learned to trust god in each and every battle that he faced he leaned from god he knew that it would be god that would send him out to battle it will be god that will sustain him during the battle and it will be god that would go with him returning from the battle what am i telling you tonight we heard a word last wednesday night it was a word it was it was a precursor it was a battle flag flying look you're going into battle but i want you to know just as well as you're going into battle the same god that's leading you it's gonna be the same god that's gonna meet you there and let me tell you you ain't gonna leave him in ohio camp he came home with you tonight he's here with you tonight you have returned from the battle and you didn't come empty-handed [Applause] see he learned what god was in his suffering he learned that god would sustain him in his battles he found god to be his necessity even in his dangers think about this many times we look at others and we desire maybe to have their testimony i mean who wouldn't want brother tim's testimony right a profound preacher from preaching for over 50 years passing over 50 years but look what it took to get to that point crippled feet when other boys were out playing games he was in there studying the word pouring himself over the word he stood against family he stood he didn't compromise on the things that were of god he stayed true and faithful to the word and now he's lifted up to a stature and look and we find many people many young ministers they idolize they want that but they don't know the struggle that it took to get there and a lot of times we want somebody else's testimony we want somebody we want to be oh a strong christian like that brother or like that system but what am i telling you it took the battles to get there it took the difficult times to get there it didn't just happen god just just didn't throw that on them no they've been in the trenches and they learned to trust god they learn that god will sustain them see it's god that sets man up and sets man down see we find many times we want a great testimony and you will have a great testimony and young people you do have a great testimony and if we're going to be anything in this life it's because god's hand is upon us because you remain courageous in the midst of your storm because you remain faithful in the midst of your battle you trusted god when you didn't see him you trusted god when you didn't hear them you trusted god when you didn't feel them you trusted god and kept marching on well the brother they would ask brother ben a question why do we why why does god allow troubles to come how many would like that answer because a lot of times we don't enjoy trouble zooey come on just get with me a little bit tonight it's okay this is home so let's just have church tonight he said god harnesses trouble put bits in his mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring you into a closer fellowship with god and you think you're just being out there it's god punishing you and you know satan's trying to destroy you know god permits these things so that he can bring you into a closer fellowship a closer relationship so god can tender his hand to you and show you that he loves you you know the little story about the lamb or the sheep there in the the shepherd had to break the little sheep's leg so that he can put him on his shoulders and carry him and sometimes god does that for us he allows troubles to come but the trial the struggle the battle that we're in is not for our destruction but it's to bring us into a more intimate fellowship with god and we find david knew god in a great way he knew it was god that girded him with strength for the battle he knew it was god that brought him to each and every victory and subdued his enemies under his feet he trusted and believed that it was god that destroyed every enemy that he faced he wasn't man's idea what man's doctor wasn't man's belief it was god and see and he's the same god for you tonight he's the same god for you young people he's the same god for you older people he's the gangs and god for you middle-aged people he's the same god he girds us for the battle and he gives us our enemies he subdues our enemies under our feet and therefore david could say he is my rock he is my fortress he is my deliverer notice david pakken he's packing one title after another title after another title so david knew that god was a god of deliverance he knew that god delivered from the line and god delivered from the bear and god delivered from goliath and god delivered from saul and god kept him from backslide and god kept him from israel's enemies and god kept him from his own son absalom and god kept him from his own sinful passion he knew what it meant to believe and sin and a living god that would sustain him through every situation and i believe he could easily trust in this god he's my rock he's my fortress he's my deliverer he's my shield he's my stronghold he's my savior oh my when we start looking at god like that it's easy to trust him he start putting accolations on god and start adoring him and and reverencing him and what he is to you you'll see god in a different light hoping many times what we want to do is we want to we want to give praise to the enemy or we want to give give voice to the enemy oh i got this doubt and i got this depression and well we're always in the wowzy wilds it's time that we silence the voice of the enemy and start giving praise to almighty god it's god that is keeping us in the battle see david learned to trust god in his youth he didn't wait till he was older to serve god he meditated on god day and night while he was out hurting the sheep see he had a relationship and he cultivated that relationship when he was on the back side of the desert all alone with nothing but a sling in his hand but yet he thought about god what is god who is god and when the lion came in and a bear came in to take a little sheep david ran after him and snatched the sheep from his mouth and when he rose up against him he took him by the beard and slit his throat and destroyed him why he trusted in god he knew that god called him to that position notice not only that but david believed that the same god that kept him from the line and from the bear is also the same god that would keep him from giants see god was just allowing his servant to be trained now i don't know about you but i don't want to meet a bear i don't want to meet a lion no matter how big or small much less of goliath but many of you have faced lines in your lives your faith bears in your lives your faith to lies in your life and yet you're still here tonight yeah you're still standing tonight yet you're still victorious tonight you can look back over your life and seen where god's hand and his provision has been on you the whole time church and david learned this about god that god that kept me then is the god that's going to keep me now this god will keep me in each and every battle this god will still do each and every enemy under my feet i trusted him then i'll trust him now i trusted him last week in ohio i'll trust him on the wednesday night i'll trust god tomorrow i'll trust him if i have cancer i'll trust him if i had sugar diabetes i'll trust him if i would trust this guy because he's seen me in every way see he experienced battle after battle and he had victory after victory he knew what it was to see casualties of war he felt the agony of disappointments he faced his share of failures he was just like you a man nothing more nothing less actually he was anointed by god but you're anointed with god and that david can stack on all this title after title of what god was him only by an anointing on the flesh what about you and i with the anointing on the inside of us not this flesh being anointed but our souls our lives being in order our lives being changed our homes being changed our jobs being changed everything about us being changed not because man's idea not because of theology not because of psychology but because the word of god has come down and rooted and burned out all darkness and unbelief but david also knew how to rejoice in victory david knew what it meant to bring the ark of the covenant back home and maybe he had some church goers in his church they criticized a little bit all that moving about all that emotion all that can't we just sit there and just bring the ark and put it back in this place and sometimes if we're not careful that's the attitude that we have when we see a little wildfire take place a little bit of fire happened in our young people oh but the problem is you don't know what they know you should have been there on a thursday night when the holy ghost dropped down and started dealing with hearts and life you should have been there on a friday night oh well there's too emotional there to this you should have been there on a saturday when chains fell off and all the heaven came behind him you should have been there on a sunday morning when he said let's make it a real fight let's make it a good fight you should have been there and if you were there you could say like him oh you don't know what kind of what my god done for me he brought me out of darkness he put me into the light he broke complexes off of me he broke fear out from he destroyed depression you don't know like i know i'm free tonight that's what i know i know i'm free to worship i know i'm free to rejoice and david knew how to rejoice in victory the problem is you ain't got enough victory it's time to experience some victory rejoice in your god rejoice in your savior rejoice in your redeemer praise the living god for what he has done for you he was jubilant with praise and thanksgiving when returning from the battle i don't think he came back defeated actually they said david fought 60 66 battles and he never lost a one oh come on i'm looking at some davids i'm looking at some davids on the wednesday night in a battle but there's no fear of defeat oh david could say as for god his way is perfect he's all together blameless for who is god saved the lord who is the rock saver god for he is my strength and my power he is my fortress of my strength oh he make my feet like hein's feet otherwise he makes my feet swift in strength and in pursuit of the enemies he teaches my hands to war you don't do these things with the mind of a man but god teaches your hand teaches you how to bend the bow teaches you it's god that teaches us these things see thou has given me thy shield of thy salvation it's god that protects and saves his people he has enlarged my steps under me god has made it your platform so big you don't have to worry about stumbling you don't have to worry about missing it you don't have to worry about falling you don't have to worry about the bus ride back well i ain't going to get it no he made your platform big enough you ain't got to worry about nothing you just keep on walking you keep on stepping be like oh the the prayer of your bed lord increase my borders god it ain't enough room in here tonight i need more victory i need more of the glory of god i need more tonight god enlarge my borders lord i believe in you tonight god [Applause] so thou has also given me the next of my enemies not my neck to them but their neck to us then i beat them down small as the dust of the earth pulverized them scattered them stamped them as though they were just mire of the street and i spread them abroad let that sit there for a minute let that just set there in your mind just for a minute pulverize them scatter them i did stamp them as a mire of the street and i did spread them abroad well church if you got an enemy tonight that's what your enemy needs to look like see by these scriptures we can conclude that david knew how to trust god in battle and he gives credit to the lord for his going in and is going out see he was courageous his faith was built on nothing less than jesus christ and his righteousness he believed for victory see he was leaning on the everlasting arm of jehovah he wasn't leaning on his own ability and many times that's what man does they lean on their own ability we're not looking at the ability of a man to like we're looking at the anointing of the holy spirit and david knew what it meant to push the sword to the heart of the enemy he knew what it meant to allow god to teach him how to fight and that's why we come to the house of god it's why we come to the church that's why we feed on the things of god because we want to say like david lord teaches my hands to war teach me to fight help me be skillful in battle father the prophet of god will tell us we're not on a picnic no we're in a battlefield so many people just think when they become a christian that's all that they and they need to do that settles it forever he says as they are christian and everything's going to come easy he says don't never get that in your head church we're in a battle we're in a battle we've become both says i become a christian to fight fight the good fight of faith come on i should be a little bit more amen than that i know it's wednesday night i know we don't want to talk about fighting in trials because oh man if i start talking about it i'ma have one tomorrow morning so what am i saying i'm saying we can't take psychology and expect to defeat the enemy we can't take some second-handed experience and expect to defeat the enemy we can't take some denominational view or some man's idea and expect to defeat the enemy we must take the word and that word anointed by the spirit of almighty god and line the two up and then when you face your demon when you face that enemy when you're in the midst of your battle then you can have confidence that the word will never fail you it has never failed in the mouth of a believer if it never failed then it won't fail you tonight you can put those words on your lips tonight and it's just the same as deity speaking it's just the same as god saying let there be all that you've got to do is find that anointing find that word and release your prayer lease your faith tonight don't believe that whatsoever you ask god said he'll do it for you tonight well that said you got to fight for every inch friends this is not a picnic this is a battleground we never come here to eat cookies now i don't know about you but i like girl scout cookies especially the little thin mint ones they're killer but this thing girl scout cookies we're not passing out cookies oh have a good time we are in a battle and satan is after our souls see he wants to destroy your very existence how many of you familiar with winston churchill winston churchill made this statement he says success always demands a greater effort success always demands a greater effort and if we're going to be successful in our battles then we've got to give a greater effort young people we've got to feed on the word of god put down those things that are distracting you now i know some of you are in all these little chat groups my goodness you can't you can't do anything without this little boy or a little girl i'm like put your phone down before you go to the bathroom no put these things down that are distracting you say that in jess but you're all smiling because y'all guilty guilty sentenced as charged uh-huh see you gotta meditate on the word if you would put that kind of dedication to your prayer life [Music] oh it's supposed to be a faith-building message it is if we're going to be successful in battle then we got to put mon for a better effort what am i telling you i'm proud of where you are i'm proud of how you come home but if we're going to be successful if we're gonna finish this thing church we gotta put a greater effort in we gotta pray more we gotta believe more we gotta trust god more we gotta listen to the word more put in more god won't disappoint you young people god reveal himself to you in a supernatural way [Applause] many of you gain a lot of ground this weekend but there's more to be gained keep fighting keep pressing the battle keep pushing forward the land belongs to you go take it let me encourage you go take it it's yours go take it see you were engaged this past weekend in a battle and we stayed behind and we prayed god change them god change them i didn't just pray for the adams kids i prayed more for them but i didn't pray solely for them but i prayed for you and you and you and you oh i pray god will move god move on our young people brother aaron did a masterful job last wednesday like sending you off with courage you're going into a battle but the banner's been lifted the standard has been raised this church stands behind you we support you and i'm going gonna tell you again i'm here to reiterate we stand with you tonight we're thankful for the victory we're thankful that you return from the battle but i want you to not quit don't stop don't settle for that keep marching keep moving keep striving there's more of god to be had there's more victories to be had [Applause] many times we think when we get back home and we start running from the enemy running from the enemy fret the prophet of god will tell us you don't have to knock down to the devil y'all know what knuck down means no there you go mississippi right there coming out you don't have to knock down and cower down to the devil no how many you taste victory this weekend no no no that was weak how many of you tasted victory this weekend come on somebody god you've done something for me i came home changed well if you come home with that just think about it one more victory one more victory one more victory another head another demon another enemy destroyed how did that feel this is only until it gets better and better and better and better and better you don't have to knock down to the

speak in tongues if he wants you to dance if he wants you to do whatever he's urging you to do you know that is there you feel it your own self he says the only thing you got to do is learn to let go

was gonna take another step some of you didn't know if he was gonna make it to the camp some of you didn't even know what you were gonna do when you got home because it seems like it's just like before but can i say something can i quote the a famous man by the name of winston churchill canada tonight he said we shall defend our island whatever the cost we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender he said we shall fight in the parking lot we shall fight in empty fields and on wide streets we shall never surrender let me just say he wasn't just talking to a bunch of englanders he was talking to you and i tonight i believe he was anointed tonight to speak those words that somebody was going to tap into it and he was going to come and he's going to say the same things we shall defend this message whatever the cost we're going to fight for our families we're going to fight for our children we're going to fight for healing we're going to fight for deliverance we're going to fight for joy we're going to fight for peace we're going to fight for the holy ghost we're going to fight for the supernatural we're going to fight until our bodies have been changed and we're sitting at the mere supper of the land we shall never surrender but we will fight and devil we're going to make it a good fight we're going to make it a real fight we got one objective brother set one objective i'm going to win let that be your objective let that be your objective let that be your objective i'm going to win you know when i was out in the world i told y'all i like to fight i didn't fight fair i was little a little bit bigger than i am now fat i mean five foot nothing you gotta learn to use what you can pick up come on shamgar you got to learn to use what you can pick up oh it might not be kosher it might not be theological but that don't matter use what you can pick up and go to fight i got one objective i'm not gonna lose i told my son he's big good lord he's got stronger than me i'm not real happy about that one i tried to wrestle him the other day thought i was gonna pick a little fight he picked me up and slammed me on the couch i'm like oh we gotta think about this strategy that one didn't work but i looked at him in the face i said we're only playing we're only playing because difference between me and you you're like your mama you're sweet gentle nature i ain't you're my son tilt me on the couch if it's a real fight watch out and that's what i'm telling you no matter what it takes when when when it all costs if it means forsaken family win if it means forsaken friends when if it means forsaking those video games win if it means forsaking those websites win if it means letting go of this win what am i saying no matter what it takes we shall fight and fight and fight we shall never surrender we have one objective in this message and that is the win to take a body change we're not giving up we're not backing down we're not turning loose we're going forward brother we're going forward over christian soldiers marching after war one purpose one motive that's to be the victor take the word of god and cut your way through every doubt he said that's my next job cut your weight through doubt cut your weight through all these other things all your frustrations all your senses cut your weight through him if you're conscious he goes and brother man says you know my conscience tell me brother branham well that might that might as well cut that thing away says you know you ain't gonna get no further than that you're just gonna be the same when you get home cut it away i can't lose you start talking like a winner when you start talking like a winner you'll start acting like a winner and when you start acting like a winner you can't lose david knew where he stood and he talked like a winner and when he went out there in the face of adversity he never lost what about it david what about it david see young people you've cut your way through doubts that it was for you you cut your way through complex that you're not good enough but you're not pretty enough so devil take those things and twist it on you make you look in the mirror and say well look at me huh you know i'm just playing well good the bible says we're fearfully and wonderfully made i look in the mirror i'm like god thank you for that love handle and thank you for that one too you know the world wants these greek gods i look at them like yeah that's well you got three percent body fat you ain't got no life i got 10 here 10 there i enjoy some some ice cream oh yeah chocolate chip cookie dough vanilla bean talk to me i don't eat clean i'm not worried about what i look like i'm happily married praise the lord i know some of you are on your way so you got to keep yourself down don't go getting all undone now be obese overnight but these complexes you cut your way free from them i'll talk about what happened this weekend you cut your way free from fear that the holy ghost was for you that you can never get it you cut your way free from deep rooted depression you some of you cut your way free from suicidal thoughts where the devil said just cut your wrists do it this way so it don't cloud up you cut your way free from it that's some of the victories we're packing tonight see some of you young people had a forever change in eternal change mom and daddy couldn't do that for you the pastor and the preachers couldn't do that for you but you went to a battleground and you fought you waged war spiritual warfare in the face of the enemy and he was howling you're going to lose you're going to lose you're going to lose some of y'all had enough faith on thursday night to get the victory some of y'all was friday night think about the order of sequence thursday night stirred your remembrance you know david got into a place we're gonna get there i got a few more minutes i know where i'm at stirred your remembrance then on friday night what happened the light came by and broke chains then saturday all of heaven turned loose on you and sunday morning after heaven turned loose on you god equipped you with fighting power we're gonna make this a good fight and now wednesday we get to return home from the battle god doesn't make mistakes and last wednesday the banner was going before you god was waving that banner saying i'm going not only before you but i'm going with you i'm going gonna be in you i'll meet you in the prayer line i'll meet you at the altar i'll meet you in the worship i'll meet you in the word i'll be there and he's waving that flag here are the colors right here oh you may get down but look up see the colors it's still waving we're still winning we ain't been beat yet we haven't been defeated yet this word has never lost a defeat this word will defeat satan anytime anywhere on any crowd under any condition what does he doing going before us tonight telling you you're still in the battle keep moving keep marching for them says when a man takes god at his word brother that'll kill satan every time that's the death stroke oh my god that's the death stroke anyway he said that's the hardest hit that satan can get when the man will take god at his word he says they tell me when a plane really breaks a sound bear there's no limit to its speed because when you break that traditional barrier that jesus was back there then he isn't now when you find that he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no limit to what god can do right here in this convention when people get to hunger in their heart that the veil is ready to be broke you can just depend on that rent every veil by the holy spirit and he stands here tonight the mighty conqueror the same yesterday today and forever healing the sick baptizing the believers just as he did then he's the mighty conqueror now doom devils are on the run what am i telling you the same god that met you last week is here tonight and dude devils were on the run then and they're on the run tonight you can't lose young person oh the bible says if god be for us that who can be against us oh you can't lose you've got a winning proposition first john and four and four you are of god little children and have overcome him already past tense because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world see matthew 16 and verse 18 and i say unto thee also the thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it see the church is not a building the church is a people and god is building his church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against you tonight oh notice we got we can go on and on and on see them he's going to come back to some of you he's going to try to steal away what god did for you this weekend he's going to lie to you but don't entertain his lies don't you stop for one second he was defeated and he is defeated and he remains defeated but as soon as you open up and entertain that lie his defeat is over keep him under your feet but lebron makes a statement here in search we receive jesus he says we don't back up if you don't like fighting and you don't like loud noise you don't like jubilee you don't like worshiping god maybe you're in the wrong place there's a baptist church about three miles down the road oh but we ain't backing up come on somebody i said we ain't backing up we ain't stopping and we ain't losing oh my the land belongs to us and we're going to get it now how many wants victory tonight probably god said if you want victory then you got to have a battle oh i raised my hand too soon what was i thinking brother joe that was not nice that was trickery he said before you can have victory there has to be a battle and there if there is no battles then there is no victory so we ought to be thankful for the battles and the tryings and it's god given us notice given us the opportunities to have victories see if there was no war then there would be no victory and all things are possible to them to them that believe see no matter what the odds are we believe the bible would tell us in romans 8 and verse 33 who shall lay anything to the charge of god elect it is god that justified who is he that condemneth that is christ that has died yet rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword he says as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the lay long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay but in all things we are more than conquerors i'm not talking to losers i'm talking to conquerors tonight see we have nothing to fear god has promised that he would never leave us he would never forsake us and god doesn't pull back in the heat of the battle but he reinforces and reinforces if you go back and look at the order of the services he was reinforcing and reinforcing from wednesday till today he was reinforcing and reinforcing standard lifted stirred your remembrance about a living god who he was never leaving never forsake you broke the chains off of you all heaven came back behind it and turned loose on your behalf then he encouraged you the last message is to fight to fight a good fight to fight a real fight and when the fight's over then we'll return home from battle the bible will tell us in romans 12 that there was war in heaven and michael and his angels fought against a dragon and dragon fought against his angels and they prevailed not and neither was her place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and satan was deceived the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength a loud voice i think it was a voice of rejoicing now has come salvation now has come strength now the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of the brother is cast down which accused him before god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death therefore rejoice if heaven can rejoice because of their victory shouldn't we be able to rejoice for our victory come on grandma grandpa can't you rejoice for your grand grandkids mom and dad maybe you don't have a kid present but you can still rejoice in the victory because that victory wasn't just their victory that's our victory it's our victory all heaven rejoice shouldn't we be able to rejoice first chronicles 26 and verse 27 as we start wrapping this up no i'm not going to be done by 8 30. i'm just going to tell you maybe 9 o'clock maybe 9 30 maybe 10. since out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the lord so out of the spoils that are won in battle did they dedicate to maintain the house of the lord see spoils of war are plunder loot goods taken in battle by the victors not the losers the first time this word spoils was ever mentioned in the bible is in genesis 14 when those kings came down to sodom and gomorrah and took lot and took all the solomon all gemara and when abraham found out that his nephew was taken abraham and 318 men went down let's look at this just for a minute could you just imagine all these kings they're rejoicing they got it they got lot they got to see lionel abraham some of his offspring here we got it we got all the women we got all the children everything we got it all here we got the entire two cities devil's rejoicing and that's the way it was with some of you before camp he was rejoicing man i got them with depression i got them with suicide i got them with fear i got them with inferiority complexes i got them with superiority complexes i got them man i got them all right here see satan had taken lot of spoil and along with the vast herds and wagon loads of food and clothing chest full of gold silver and precious stone see the devil was boasting of his capture of abraham's seed look at lot he's bound and changed and stripped of all his goods and that's exactly what satan does to us but it ain't over yet god has the final saying now we find abraham he goes down and he frees and he frees and rescues lot and he rescues all of them and he returns everything back to even to the shoe latch of sodom and gomorrah but all the spoils went to abraham what am i telling you tonight church the bible will tell us that what know you not that you are the temple of the lord and the spoils and victory are used to maintain the house of god and every time you go forth in the battle and you win and you're the victory you come back pack and spawn what is that for that's to maintain the house of god that's to maintain the church that's to maintain the believer we don't come back pack is false for ourselves but we come back so that even the light can rejoice so that the world can rejoice that our young people they got the victory and here are the spoils of war and what they do it helps maintain our cause that's why we're here that's why we preach the gospel that's why we believe because we know god is raising up children to defeat the enemy our trials are not meant just to be our survival but god is wanting to enrich our lives with resources and wealth and he wants to stockpile treasures on your life faith on top of faith on top of faith stacking lying upon line precept on precept victory upon victory to build us up he says i'm going to have a church brother without spot without blemish how does he do it he builds her up through victories of war as we bring this down to a close first samuel 30 and this is a very familiar scripture and it came to pass when david and his men were coming to ziglag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziglag is smitten and they had smitten ziglag and they burned it with fire and they'd taken the women captive and that were therein and they slew not any either great or small but they carried them away and they went on their way so david and his men came to the city and they behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive notice this was a spiritual battle not only a physical battle because see the sea lion was going to come down through david's gene and now the enemy determined to cut that seedline off so he takes all the women takes all the children and that's what satan's determined is to destroy the seedline to destroy the youth cut off to seed see the mickey was going to come through david's descendants so taken so satan had taken every woman child that that seed might come through see he was determined to destroy the seat of christ and he does it by attacking us and we find david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and they wept until they had no more power to weep and david's two wives that were taken and we know their names and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord you know some of us we just gravitate to negativity i used to say negative nancy but i got corrected on that you're not supposed to say negative nancy you can say knock out nancy now knock out nancy knows who's i'm talking to because knockout nancy don't have a negative nancy attitude but if oh negative nancy was in this picture here david would have never encouraged himself in the lord but david began to think about what had god done for him david began to think about how good god is and all that god had done and how god delivered him from a line and how god delivered him from a bear and how god did all these great and mighty things and david began to encourage himself in the power and the providence of god in the promises of god that was his way he began to encourage himself in knowing that i've been elected by god i've been anointed by god i've been called by god i've been placed as a king by god he began to encourage himself of the previous battles of the previous victories what am i telling your church i'm telling you it's time that we begin to remember the things that you've done that god has brought us through you're not here today to feed it but you're here tonight more than an overcomer you're more than conquerors like you've been through one battle after another battle after another battle but you're still here you're still standing he turns yourself and what god has done for you no matter the odds no matter the opponent no matter the battle no matter the situation david encouraged himself and cursed himself in the lord and i think if there's ever a church that can encourage herself in the lord we've seen cancer defeated we've seen brain bleeds defeated we've seen alopecia defeated man we've seen prodigals come home come on prodigals raise your hands man we've seen prodigals come home cancer come on cancer cancer defeated oh depression defeated suicide defeated pornography defeated what am i telling you we got something to encourage ourselves about if god thought so much of you then a same god that thought of you did it's thinking of you now you can't lose tonight you're the victor i'm telling you you're the victor tonight encourage yourself and what god has done for you notice first samuel thirty and seven and david said to happen though the priest a himalayan son i pray thee bring me hear the ephod and abbathar brought through that ephod to david and david inquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall overtake them and he answered no you probably should have stayed home on wednesday night and streamed that service brother joe's just a little bit too evangelistic for you you don't need to go no he said and he answered him pursue yeah no no no that was weak he answered him this is abbathar the priest god speaking to david in his darkest moment in his weakest moment in his most trying time and yet when he asked god god shall i pursue shall i overtake shall i recover all the voice of god thunderback pursue after the enemy you shall surely overtake the enemy and you shall surely recover all what am i telling you tonight i'll tell you that same god that anointed david is anointing you tonight don't you give up don't you back up you pursue tonight i'm telling you in the name of the lord you shall overtake and you shall recover all you got kids out in the world pursue tonight you shall overtake them and we shall recover we're not going to leave a hoof behind [Applause] your marriage is falling apart pursue you wonder if everything is going to be all right will you ever change pursue you wonder will you be the great mighty warrior that you want to be pursue see the devils put questions in your mind well am i just feeding off emotion am i just getting all caught up no the lord's answer and the lord's answer will always be pursue pursue pursue the same god is telling you to pursue you went last wednesday night on a message from brother aaron that said pursue overtake recover all bring home some spoils even like tabernacles need some spoils we need to see that god is good we want to taste it god is good we want to experience that god is good and when you young people went on that bus we didn't just send you off said oh praise god we get a break now no we went praying and we were with you we were in the midst of the battle somebody had to stay back with the stuff because they won't let all of us old people go to youth camps somebody's got to tarry with the stuff but what am i telling you the bible says that david chased after his enemy david went after him he said that that when they came back david the bible says in in first samuel 30 and 17 and david smote them from the twilight evening of the night into the next evening otherwise he got through on a thursday night and he began to fight and they fought all night thursday all day friday all night friday night all day saturday all day saturday night all day sunday he fought on the way home on the bus he fought off monday he fought on tuesday and he's here tonight and he's still fighting what am i telling david is fighting this enemy david ain't giving up david ain't backing down no david is pursuing david's cutting his enemy david smoked them and they're escaped not a man and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and david rescued his two wives and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoiled nor anything that had taken from them david recovered oh see david knew what his god was capable of he saw the line he saw the bear he saw goliath he'd been in 66 battles david didn't know what it mean to lose come on david the same god that told david is the same god speaking to you tonight you've returned home from the battle notice what he does after the battle david came to the 200 men this is verse 21 which were faint that they could not follow david whom they had made also to abide in the brook bazaar and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people that were with him and david came near to the people and he saluted them then answered all the wicked men the men of alau and those that went with david and they said because they were not they were not with us we will not give them out of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and depart i'm only going to let you have your family david said no that ain't how we fight that ain't how we fight you got this all wrong notice what david says then david said you shall not do so my brother with that which the lord had given us who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our hand for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part that goeth down to the battle so is his part that tarried with the stuff that they shall be part of life what am i telling even like tabernacle these victories that these young people came they brought back from after the battle that ain't just their victory it ain't just their family victory it's the church's victory the church is behind you the church is supporting it the church wants to see you overcome the church is with you church oh we're with you young people we with your families we're with what are we doing we're returning from the battle and we're packing small rejoicing in testimony after testimony some of you got the holy ghost some of you had things fall off your life what am i that's not just your victory that's our victory that's our victory that's our victory the world is rejoicing tonight in your victory the world is streaming in tonight in your victory david divided the spoils what the musicians come well if you don't know like i know what he done for me somebody better get up here and sing now before i get double platinum on the platform oh why are you so excited brother joe because i've seen god moving my my own young people i've seen god move in a special way in my son and my daughters i've seen god move i heard the testimonies i had you send me your testimony i seen god move i seen the the rim of the devil and his blockage on your life his chains of indifference fall off of him oh i've seen i'm experiencing spoils after the battle and tonight i believe we've got a few minutes we're going to hear some of that we're going to share some of the spoils of the battle come on brother mike let's sing that real quick before we start calling some up oh you don't know like i know what he's done for me you don't know like i know what he's done for me you don't know like i know what he's done for me when i think about what he's done for me [Applause] what [Applause] makes me dance when i think about what he's done for me for me [Applause] [Music] for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh he give oh for me [Music] he's still healing he's still delivering he's still set free [Applause] aren't you glad you could testify what is [Music] you can have your seats for a moment i think it's good that we can hear some of those falls feel these testimonies of what god has done and neither like tabernacle they told me i could tell the long version so get ready well back in march at oklahoma camp i went through the prayer line and i said that i wanted a refilling of the holy ghost and it was brother andrew and my dad praying for people up there and um brother andrew said well first of all you got it and i was like well yeah i know like i know when i got it i remember and everything but he was like no the devil's been lying to you like it's all over you and after that i realized that how much doubt i let like how much i lived with and um so after oklahoma camp i was able to live like i knew who i was and then at our youth camp i was back in the back running the projector on sunday morning and uh brother andrew got done preaching and everybody was singing and people were dancing and stuff and brother andrew looked all the way back at the back at me like to the back and he pointed he said you got it you got it and that was just so special that god reminded me that i had it you know and so we'll skip ahead to august now and wednesday night was like just what i needed before camp because um like i could go into camp with the mentality that i'm an overcomer and i need more of god like the devil had always made me feel guilty for needing more of god like if you need more like you must not be good enough you know but it's just the trend of laodicea like they have need of nothing and so if you go against that trend then he'll make you feel guilty but so i had this list that i had made for ohio camp and i wanted a really personal experience with god i wanted to be so full of god that it was just flowing through me and around me and like i just wanted something really personal and i wanted a refilling because i'm not satisfied and um so um thursday night rolls around and this spontaneous prayer line formed and i was like no i'm not gonna go it's okay but then brother nathan erickson i think he had been down praying with people but he went back on the platform and he was like young people if you feel the pull of god to go through this prayer line then come and a few times they had mentioned that night about charlie and rachel and how time is so fleeting like you're not promised tomorrow and it just really hit me like even at camp like i'm not promised tomorrow and i was like if i can picture like my life ending tonight like not living another day after this then i'd want it tonight and so finally i went and got in line and i was really nervous and then i was like hold up that's the devil playing with my emotions because god would never want me to be nervous he would want me to have peace and he would always want me to come to him and so i finally got up there and i ended up in front of brother andrew and brother aaron and i told them i was like i just want to know that i've given absolutely everything like i'm not holding anything back i don't want to be caught lacking only given 80 or 99 i want to give him absolutely everything and i want to be like i want to be saturated with god and um so they started praying for me and uh brother aaron prayed even that no fear complexes or anything would hinder my worship and he raised my arm in the air and he said this is the message this is the holy ghost and that was just like so meant so much to me and um then i switched back and i heard brother andrew and he had quit praying and he said and my eyes were still closed my hands were in the air but he said it's different this time and you know it he said you testify and i said he's mine and the devil can't take him away and my arms were straight up in the air just waving in the air and after that i felt like i was like three feet from my body watching myself praise god i was saying other stuff i have no idea i don't know what but um and brother andrew i could still like hear certain stuff and brother andrew said man that's powerful and then he said he told brother aaron he's like hurry let's pray for the next one while that anointing is still right here and so they led me away all the way to the right of the platform and my foot was against the platform and i could hear colby singing really close but that's the only way i knew i was in that building because i was not there i was just so caught up praising god and everything was so clear that it was only god's grace that it was all god's grace that had done a work in my life and the devil was just so tiny like he tries to blow himself up but he's not that big but uh [Music] [Applause] but about 10 or 15 feet in front of me i could see the throne of god and he was sitting there in white robes and it's like my head was bowed and i could only see him out of my peripheral vision and i couldn't see above his waist but i was just praising god and there was a mass of voices behind me just praising god like heaven and out of the whole crowd i could rebecca's voice was distinct and before camp i'd really been praying for her that you know she would know she had the holy ghost and that she would surrender her gifts to god because she's so talented she's really anointed and in that moment i realized i'm gonna hear her voice in heaven and she's gonna shake the kingdom of hell while she's on this earth and she's gonna i'm gonna hear her praising god in heaven and um always when i had imagined heaven i would always just picture god and then me worshiping god and just this faceless crowd but it's not it was all the faces that i loved the people that we know people here it's going to be there and we all get to praise them they're together and so that it was just like the most amazing experience my entire life and i just held it in my heart and i didn't really have the words to tell anybody until friday night after church when i told the girls in my dorm and i was just i was telling them about it and i was just crying and crying and i was like god you're going to have to be my strength because i want to be back there i don't want to be here i was like you're going to have to be my strength to live on this earth because i feel so weak and me and lily were just crying and she was praying with me and i couldn't fall asleep that night and i ended up only getting four hours of sleep but um i turned on the lifeline app and brother brandon was preaching the commission and he started talking about heaven like almost right when i turned it on and i heard and i got on the table app and i was like i gotta find that and so i found it and i'll tell you what he said he said now just think after the battle is all over and the smokes died down we come up meet our loved ones and then meet him we sat down at the table across from each other won't that be wonderful there will never be a crutch or a wheelchair around the table oh won't that be marvelous and then when we see all that setting along there i look across the table and i say well god bless you brother my and then we'll just have to cry a little bit don't you believe so if we can we'll just cry a little bit for joy and then at the head of the table will come out our king and his majesty he'll walk down along all of us and put his arms around us and say you suffered much you went through much for me he wipes away all the tears from our eyes now don't cry anymore it's all over oh for that great time that's why we're here isn't it i want to be wonderful to feel his arm around you and say now don't cry enter into the joys of the lord you've fought a good fight so while we're here and got this opportunity let's make it a good fight a real fight and after that i was i felt like i was getting my strengths back to go on but sunday morning brother timothy read his opening scriptures and then he read the exact quote i asked him about it later and he said it was already in his notes but and he preached that morning on let's make it a good fight he could have just titled it this is for lauren adams but it's okay but if you haven't heard it you should totally go listen to it um because it was amazing but you know usually at camp you're really sad to come home because it's like amazing but after this and i was like no it's it's really not sad to come home i was like it doesn't matter if i'm at camp if i'm at home because i'm fighting to get back there [Music] not just for the adams family but for even the light family for the bride of jesus christ that's why we fight tonight i had a couple of select people to come up if we don't get to all of you tonight what i'm gonna ask you to do is to uh maybe video your testimony and let us put it on the facebook page so we can keep it as a memorial of what god has done so please do that some of you have wrote it down but let's video it and keep it so it triggers back up a year from now the devil's still under your feet i might have to read this because i know it's going to be all over the place if i don't so going into camp i didn't know what i really wanted but i knew i wanted him to speak to me personally i started i start i'll start by saying i don't get offended by any of the jokes between us and our friends but being the only thank you [Applause] it's my baby here mama's staying with you too but being the only black kid in church was kind of overwhelming and sometimes i felt out of place i kept it to myself because i thought if i did then it would all just go away the devil attacked me a lot about it and i just never told anyone just kept it to myself well saturday night i went through the prayer line knowing that i would go in one way and come out completely different and sure enough i got that and so much more i made it to uncle timothy and he said you belong here and at that moment i just broke down fell to the floor just bawling my eyes out satan had attacked me long enough with you'll never fit in or you'll never be like them i mean look at you you're black in a church full of white people i was helped by two sisters to a bench where i would just cry and thank god for the longest time i don't know i stayed there for at least a good 30 minutes and then i finally got up and there was this random sister that was there and she gave me the biggest hug in the world and said he's so work he's so real and to myself i was like lady you just don't even know like i know for real until af i had finished thought i finished crying when that happened and then i bawled my eyes out on this random lady's shoulder and then so after that i got myself together at least thought i did and then katie comes and i was like well the floodgates are open again and i started crying all over again and i had to get myself together because i wanted to be back to my bike back into myself so i could experience everybody else getting blessed in the service [Music] [Applause] you belong jay you belong felicia you belong hell you belong sister aretha you belong brother johnny you belong church we all belong oh we're christians we're believers we're not separated by our sins oh we've been purchased by the blood oh the world wants to separate us but we're not separated by our race we're separated from sin we're separated from unbelief oh we're sons and daughters of the most high gods you put that devil in this place every day when you think you're not loved you call the adam's house [Music] we'll love you when nobody else will even you brother hale [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah few more can we go a few more we got time it's all right let's still only 9 o'clock man y'all staying up late on this watching football or something netflix hulu one of them things chelan these are hand-picked on purpose and if i didn't pick you it's not on purpose it's just these are special that i think the world needs to hear about these okay so i've had touches from god and i've been delivered from stuff in the past but i've never had anything that i could look back on and say that i got the holy ghost until friday night so for around the past year i've been basically completely spiritually dead and i knew i didn't have the holy ghost and i honestly didn't want to give god everything and i didn't want to give up the stuff that i was doing in my life that i knew a holy ghost person wouldn't do or say and so basically i just kept walking away from god and god would speak to me but i never answered him i just turned away and the past few months for me had been really difficult i felt super miserable to the point where i didn't want to do anything and i would just feel so emotionally and physically drained from talking to people because i was just pretending and just before ohio camp i was so done with sin and being depressed that i was just like i can't live like this anymore something's gonna change and i wanted god to change me completely because i knew i couldn't do it without him so thursday was a really great service and i enjoyed it but i was kind of feeling down because i didn't really feel god talking directly to me and then friday comes and i'm like really tired and i'm like i don't think i'm really gonna get anything out of the service but brother timothy starts preaching and literally every word of that sermon was directly for me and i just felt god come down and i couldn't wait to get to the altar and just give him everything and i'm just standing there crying and brother wayne comes down and he says i felt the spirit of god tell me to come pray for you and he starts praying and i'm just bawling and i start giving everything to god and the ministers leave and i'm still praying i'm just standing there just literally everything just i didn't want anything and the devil tried to come and he's like if you if you give up this you're gonna go have to apologize to some people you're gonna go have to apologize to parents are you willing to do that and i'm like i just i just can't live like this anymore i have to i can't i just can't and i as i was praying i just felt the most beautiful presence i've literally ever felt in my life flow over me i collapse and i'm just laying there and i did not want to move i'm just like laying on the ground and i'd kind of wondered before how like mariah did it because me usually when i'm praying at the altar i'm just like i'm thinking about other things sometimes and i'm thinking about how my knees are or my fear or if if people can see the snot running down my face but i was literally just i was i was just thinking about god and i was thanking him for what he'd done for me and they started playing playing the song i hear my chains falling and i literally felt something propel me off the ground and i screamed my chains are on the ground and i i just sat there worshiping god and thanking him and telling him i love him because i'm free and i have the holy ghost and nothing can ever take that away from me [Applause] amen since marie you needed that your family's been through a battle but you got a spoil you got victory right here you got victory right here you got victory right here we got something we point the devil back to he lost the soul that he thought he had the chains have fallen off and we're free at last oh church a living god look what god has done for even like tabernacles we got a couple more we're going to do amen i'm so thankful for us being allowed to go to ohio camp and all the testimonies that have come from it it's just been a real blessing but for the past two years i've been seeking the holy ghost and after every camp or special meeting i'm like lord i want the holy ghost i want you to feel me just completely fill me but after every camper meeting that i didn't get it i'd come home real down because i'm like well i didn't get it this time and i was like when am i even gonna get it at the next time why go why should i try why go to the altar he didn't answer me last time i went why would he answer me this time but that was just eliza the devil speaking to me but it's been a real battle and this year at oklahoma camp i was went there asking and seeking for the holy ghost and the lord touched me he gave me a touch of the holy ghost and he did it last year at ohio camp too but i didn't allow him to completely fill me i just lord i said lord you can have this but you can't have all of me but this year at ohio camp brother andrew spencer preached about repentance and complete full repentance and so that night in the prayer line i was well actually while i was preaching i said prayer i said lord everything i am i give it to you all my dreams all my thoughts all my plans god my whole life i gave it to him that night and so i went down into the prayer line thursday night and i went up to brother wayne and brother timothy and i said i want the holy ghost i said i've gotten touches before but i want it to completely fill me and that i just know that i have it well brother wayne said you're in the right place he said he's already done it for youth tonight he can do it again and he said all you have to do is open up your heart so right then i lifted up both my hands and i started praying i said lord i've given you my all i pray that you'll just come fill me and brother wayne said that's it and he just started praying for me then after he prayed for me he said joseph it's happening he said he's filling you and he said i want you to remember this song i want you to remember this date i want you to remember this sermon because this is where it happened and brother andrew preached on stirred by remembrance the song they were singing was nothing but the blood and i forgot the date but i have it written down in my notebook but i just stood at the altar and i was praising the lord for it and after that night i was really changed i just got to enjoy camp not worry about anything just have a good time and enjoy the presence of the lord and sunday morning brother timothy preached on let's make it a good fight and at the end it was very powerful and during the end song service they were singing you don't know like i know well i was so done with the devil attacking me and i knew i got the holy ghost and i know i was changed but i just wanted to rub it in a little bit so i took my shoes off in church which is something guys shouldn't do just saying usually keep them on but i took them off and i wrote the devil's name on the bottom of my shoe and while i was doing that brother andrew spencer said i get joy when i think about satan under my feet well after that i put my shoes back on and i started praising the lord and dancing and shouting and just having a good time in his presence praising the lord well after that service i looked at the bottom of my shoes and the devil's name was gone and that just proved to me that he's no longer around me he doesn't have a hold on me any longer and you wonder why we shout and you wonder why we praise god or what if that was your young boy who's been in a battle who've been in a struggle now he's got the victory i got a reason to shout i got a reason to rejoice oh we got a reason tonight even like tabernacle our young people went to battle but they come home packing a victory hey come home bring it small and now they're sharing we got one more tonight sister manny oh my don't try to shut me up my son got the holy ghost lauren's before the throne of god hearing my daughter rebekah sing i hope i'm in there somewhere please lord okay so it's kind of a mess but i kind of wrote it last minute um so like joseph was saying i've been seeking the holy ghost for some time now i fought from camp to camp and nothing ever supernatural happened to me i thought i had it every time something happened i danced i shouted and i just felt refreshed after it wasn't and the devil was saying oh you danced so you must have it but i'll fall right back in the same traps as before here recently i've just been wanting the holy ghost so bad like i've never wanted something so bad in my life so i had a desire like it was i don't know i can't explain it it was just like i had to have him like i can't live this life without him so this youth camp i had told myself i'm gonna get it i had to get it i can't walk away without it i i don't want to live without them um so i made a list expectations and all that stuff and um i had all these scenarios in my head of how it would go like thursday night oh yeah it'd be great probably be great saturday i might get it i don't know i might get it sunday it's gonna be rejoicing time it'd be great well none of that happened and so i got really discouraged because like i felt nothing i felt emotionless i had no hope i felt like a failure and so i actually reached out to brother joe on saturday morning because i didn't know what else to do like i've went through prayer lines i went through both i went every single night almost and i was like lord why can't i get it why is it not for me am i not worthy enough am i not loved enough so brother joe um had sent me a message back he said repent and be baptized and you shall receive it it's mine just claim it i told him that i was scared that i was gonna go to hell and wouldn't make into the rapture he went on and at the end he actually prophesied over me he's i'm just going to read it for y'all so he said god loves you god sees you god has heard your hearts cry and let me prophesy that you will get what you are seeking you receive the indwelling of the holy ghost you will have joy you will walk in victory and you put your foot on the head of that thing that's been tormenting you and you will be changed so i went through the prayer line saturday night no minister said anything that stuck out they said nothing so i felt like why am i here like why did god put me on this place and i got nothing so um every night everyone would like come and tell their testimonies in the dorm of like what had happened or what they experienced like i was happy for them but i wasn't happy if that makes sense um so after i text brother joe he'd answered um rebecca paris actually saturday morning i had like let her read where brother joe sent because i don't know i was like i didn't really i cared what he said but like i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry this is just the devil it's just the devil i don't care i don't care i promise i care um so anyway rebecca paris listened and we had a good talk it was a really good talk and i'm glad that god had put her in that moment so she could help me and stuff and so um that night i believe it was saturday night after the prayer line i had went to my room just reading my bible and praying like lord please like i can't i can't carry on so um the girls got back in their dorm and um tori was actually saying it's not something you have to work up it's a gift you just have to take the gift i thought that hold on lost my spot add thought okay i had a thought oh wait there's still one more service like don't don't give up hope there's one more service so sunday rolled around i prayed for a piece that i would leave there that like even though it wasn't coming that i had a piece like i know it was coming and so um i left with the piece the service all the services were great um the piece i just had like a piece like lord even though it's not my time like i know it's coming you promise it to me so um we had got back on the bus we kind of just chilled and hung out for a while well everything started settling down people started giving their testimonies and so i was i text rebecca paris again and i told her that i felt bad for not having a testimony it's like lord everyone is testifying on what you've done this weekend and i have nothing to testify of i have nothing and so um she told me that just talk to brother aaron of all the seats that could have been opened it was a seat right beside me so i had a hope like just because we're on the bus like there's you can he can meet you anytime anyplace anywhere you don't have to be on the campground you don't have to be in a special meeting you don't have to be in a church service he can meet you anywhere and so um like i said i'm a very planned and organized person and so i had all of these scenarios of how it would go well it didn't go that way so um the scenario that i made up was rebecca adams was supposed to come and sing and i was going to talk to him brother aaron while he was while she was singing well didn't work out that way um brother aaron gave a speech after someone had finished their testimony and literally said all the things that i was thinking he said you know just because we left the campgrounds doesn't mean we can't create an atmosphere right here it's not too late it's never too late the president can drop right here on this bus and we can get and you can get what you have been asking for just because you didn't get it at camp doesn't mean you can't get it now i know you've been on your phone while the testimonies have been going on which is okay i knew right then he was talking to me because i was texting everyone in our group chat [Music] that we had yes we have a group chat i'm sorry we have a group chat um anyway they um i was just telling them like hey y'all pray for me because i kind of want to talk to brother aaron and i'm kind of scared dr brother aaron and sorry that i was scared to talk to you brother aaron um he lost my place again anyway he was i was texting back to the group chat um i was like y'all pray for me i'm scared to talk to him like i don't want to leave this bus i don't want to go home the same way that i came and so he was um giving his little speech i don't remember all that he was saying because i was kind of crying because he was literally saying everything that i was thinking and he had finished his speech and he started praying for me and asked ask me do you think you aren't worthy enough to have it do you think you can't receive it because you think he will leave you which it never really crossed my mind when he said that it was spot on though my mom had left me when i was younger and i guess i was scared he would leave me too i don't remember a lot of what he said i just began confessing and testifying i wasn't going to be like my mom and that i was going to get the holy ghost i am worthy enough he loved me so much that he died and took all my sins away i had to surrender everything and i was ready to surrender everything i had to get to a point of you know it's either this world or it's him i just wanted him and that's all nothing else in this world matters of all the places that could have happened it happened on the bus don't you tell me god can't do it he can do it anytime any place anywhere that's right and the devil can't tell me it didn't happen either because i had 50 or more witnesses right beside me fighting this battle along with me this isn't like last time i thought i had it before but i got the real deal i have never been so happy let's make this last little bit a good fight we got this it isn't going to be easy but we are on the winning side we can't lose don't ever lose hope he always shows right on time amen hallelujah church hallelujah spoils of war your young people come packing testimonies life-changing testimonies let's give the young people a round of applause tonight i'm a round of applause we support you we love you we're on your side we're believing we're fighting with you beside you for you you're not in this by yourself look around young person even like tabernacle stands with you tonight we'll stand with you tomorrow we'll stand with you when nobody else will stand you belong you belong you belong spoils returning from the battle we got one more that i think is going to be a very big encouragement to the church and his brother aaron from there and took a burden to preach last wednesday get on the bus with all these crazy teenagers get no sleep and we all know that brother aaron's had some health issues not in his mind but he's had some health issues and that was a big undertaking that was not a simple little thing for him to do i mean come on he's not five foot six he's he had bus seats they're small so he had to figure out how to do that how big are they okay bus seats all i don't ride a bus i fly not first class but i fly coach next year there you go so this was a big undertaking and i want to say brother aaron thank you for taking the burden to take our young people and wave that banner and take the colors up there and declare that even like standing with you we're standing with you we didn't send you along and god laid it upon his heart to go with you and and the lord done something very special for brother aaron brother and if you've come at this time and give your testimony um i i do want to take the opportunity to also uh thank brother matthew and sister elizabeth they did an incredible job it was awesome to have them with us and so if we give them a round of applause as well you know i got an awesome text from maddie i just want to add this she wrote me and said uh i know that sister lydia told you i was scared of you but i'm not scared of you anymore she said after what happened to me last night why would i be scared of anybody and i thought that was awesome i thought that was powerful you have a group of young people that you can and should be proud of they have an incredible reputation around the world um they are spoken of glowingly and look you don't have to tell us that they have battles and they have shortcomings and failures but why would you want to be on the side of the accuser i'd say we have incredible young people that are fighting with all their heart to get there and they're awesome and god has done some incredible things and um i'll try my best to give a short little speech 2017 i started having some very odd health issues believe it or not it started with my nose twitching and it was crazy how much it would twitch for weeks and weeks and like you could look at it and you could like literally just see it moving it was an odd thing and that we didn't know what it was and that's where it started and it started with something with nerves and i ended up going to the doctor and they found that i had strep and they started trying to treat that strep and for 40 something straight days i had strep and no matter what antibiotics they gave me no matter what they did it wouldn't touch it wouldn't go away then over the period of the next couple years i don't know the exact number but i ended up having strep i want to say 19 times and it was um they believed it had to do with some kind of autoimmune long story short they couldn't never really pin down what was going on why was this constantly happening things of that nature but then it started it triggered something i'm just saying what the doctor said it triggered something that caused something in the in the muscular realm and that's when they sent me over to houston some of y'all may remember that they sent me to houston to some specialists and and i didn't realize that when i was there but the doctor actually um she never told me this exact word and i can't remember it now forgive me some people are more detailed than me but she gave me a diagnosis and i didn't even realize it um because i guess it was more her opinion she had wrote i believe that if you know i believe it's probably this and i didn't realize that it happened until i ended up at my neurologist the last time um some tests and things being run struggling with with real weakness uh just to give you an idea sometimes how it could be and and just so some of y'all understand my strength has never changed in a sense that i can go pick up something that i always could pick up but my i began to lose muscle stamina to where i would have to take breaks brushing my teeth because my arm couldn't last that long or washing my hair or trying to clap through a song not have the the stamina to go all the way through and it was it was affecting things like i couldn't safely climb trees to hunt you know things of that nature because my muscles would give out and so i knew something was going on but the last time i was there at the doctor he made it he made the statement he said the doctor in houston says you have such and such and forgive me for not knowing the big word it's a word for a devil and um and uh and uh and he said i'm not sure that's what it is he said if it is it would be the second time i've ever seen it in my 30-something years of practice he said you'd be the second case i'd ever seen he said but what you described to me that sounds like it matches that he said but what we're going to do is he said we'll monitor it and over a period of a year or whatever he said you come back and then i'll build a no you know we'll have a better idea of it and i'm that person that i kind of refuse to google and look into the seriousness i just wouldn't if he said we can wait a year and monitor it i figured it couldn't be yeah you know i'm good um and i know this next part when i say it i know you could get this for many things you can be turned down for things because you have high blood pressure i'm not trying to make it um more than what it is i'm just saying the devil always has a punch coming and he knows how to get you with fear and he knows how to i've done my best in lots of ways to ignore a lot of symptoms and just push through things you know when i didn't feel good but right before we left for ohio uh you know when i left my job i lost all my insurance and stuff which is fine we knew that was coming but just because i'm a planner to some degree and i want to make sure my family's taken care of i wanted to get some life insurance so when you fill all that out you have to give them permission to go through your medical records and so i just got a letter and right there in it it had that diagnosis and it said due to this you you can't get life insurance that hit me pretty hard because they're saying in other words you know we don't want to give your wife this money so it hit me pretty hard and i was like so i went with a real burden on my heart that the lord would touch me and do something for me and we laid down and took a nap one day because as he said on the way down i fell asleep at five a.m after i'd preached i fell asleep at 5am finally i was very comfortable actually and your kids were amazing by the way they're quiet respectful i just couldn't sleep fell asleep at 5am at about 6 15 the sun started coming up and it was time for father abraham and every other sunday school song you could ever imagine so i was rolling on one hour of sleep so we got the idea i took a nap and when i woke up from the nap the lord was dealing with me about my healing and i i i don't know what to tell you i can't be very specific i just know in my heart i woke up and the thought was playing in my soul within my heart that you're fitting to see six months of constant improvement that's just i don't know where that came from but it was just rolling over and over and over and i said okay lord i'll take it i'll take the improvement i'll i'll take it all the way and walk into a well body and um i'm just gonna fast forward to saturday night cause i don't wanna i don't wanna keep you just know that our god is a living god he knows um and and he's not going to be defeated in any situation prayer line had started and i had not mentioned anything about my health i was feeling fine it's not something i talk about very often so it was not something i've been brought up we're praying for people we're probably about 15 minutes in the prayer line and i'm about the fourth person down in the prayer line and we just prayed for somebody and i looked up to look to see who the next person was coming but over here brother andrew was not taking the next person he was staring at me and he caught my eye and he looked at me and he said your total healing is here right now and i'm not basing my healing on on andrew spencer the word says by his stripes i'm healed that's always been there and that's always been the promise but sometimes when the devil strikes a blow god will come right behind it and say i got something for that i got something for that right there and it just sparked the faith in my heart in that moment when he spoke to me and it anchored in my heart and i can tell you it's a finished work that i'm healed for the glory of god that it's over with and regardless of what name they gave it you know even if i ever see that doctor again he's going to say the doctor in houston was wrong because there is nothing there that would indicate that this is what you had i know it's over with i thank you for your prayers i appreciate you you are an incredible incredible church body and you deserve to share in the spoils i believe amen god bless you amen well you know what happens when they return from the battle right after you divide up all the spoils you get to rejoice in it so let's rejoice tonight for a little before we leave this evening what god has done look what he's done for our young people amen tomorrow that touched me that really touched me all of them see what god's done for my family god's done for your family god's done for our family our church family we are a blessed blessed blessed church and
