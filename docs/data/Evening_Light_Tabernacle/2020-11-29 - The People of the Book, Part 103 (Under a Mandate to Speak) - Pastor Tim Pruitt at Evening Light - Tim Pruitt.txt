battle of cancer and god's given him some great victories but we're looking for a complete victory amen we're thankful for everyone that he's had but we're looking for a complete total deliverance from this thing and i believe god's that kind of god also remember we have a couple of people today angel coleman and also christian middleton that somehow got into some poison ivy and very allergic to it having issues with that as for prayer today also brother ray montgomery is a minister in jasper georgia he's on has coveted and been on a ventilator doctors are really giving up on him he really needs a turn in the next few moments so we just ask the lord to be merciful on his behalf also his wife has covered they don't have any children so there's you know really no one there to stand with her during this time so we want to remember them today also brother gary stanky's been in the hospital with heart issues so i believe he's been dismissed but we want to remember him also sister rachel shaw asked prayer for k barber sister k barber from tucson has pneumonia again after having the covert very serious also a friend of several sisters here in the church sister shirley cobb from sibley has been diagnosed with parkinson disease and asked for prayer also we have brother steve and conroy and his family out today sick so my we have quite a few needs this morning how many would have a need to make it known to the lord ask the lord to move that's where the aaron ogles be if he'd come and open our service in prayer and take these needs before the lord today but let's just maybe you can't remember them all but maybe you can remember a few of them and just take them before the lord and just ask god to move in the mighty way and touch lives and touch hearts and god will just come in this healing power and deliver i i believe we're in that season of deliverance a season when god can pour out his spirit upon all flesh touch hearts and lives and change change situations in a moment i believe he's that kind of god so let's go to him in prayer today [Music] as brother timothy said you take one or two of these needs upon your heart right now as if it was your sister having surgery this week for cancer or your mom that had just been diagnosed with parkinson's or or whatever the need may be take one upon your heart now and lift it up before the throne of grace and and pray with all your heart with me now our dear gracious heavenly father lord how we love you lord and how thankful we are lord in this time that man has set aside is a time of thanksgiving lord i pray

thanksgiving to know that we have been invisibly united with the bridegroom the bride in christ united together by the baptism of the holy ghost sealing us into the kingdom of god what a wonderful thing lord that we can say that we have been united with you lord today there's not a one of us that has to remain in any kind of prison prison of sin or prison of sickness because you have set us free and he that the son has made free is free indeed lord we're thankful that you made us free we thank you lord for that glorious liberty we have in christ today and the place that you have us standing out lord as we come to worship you and give you praise and but more than that but to come in obedience to your word lord surrendering ourselves to you and your divine will we're asking for thine anointing today for without it we're helpless lord but lord if you just come and anoint the word you just speak we just want to move in the flow of the holy ghost we don't even want to have to think about what we're saying but just the holy spirit just putting the words in our mouth lord speaking out words of eternal life words that will break fetters and break chains of darkness and unbelief of our lives and set your people free i pray father that you know every need that is here everyone who is gathered with us today the burden that is on their heart the questions in their life the thing that they're asking for an answer for i pray that you will just do something wonderful today and reveal yourself to them personally lord take us over and speak but we ask it in jesus name amen amen god bless you you'll turn with me to mark chapter 11 verse 20. so good to see each one of you today in the house of the lord together pray that his blessings will be upon you in a very wonderful way today and god will speak to you through his word and trust you had a hope a happy thanksgiving and gathering together um and exercising what freedoms there are left here in in america today as rules are being made up right and left about what we can't and cannot do but anyway we're here we're here to to glorify god and to celebrate the liberty that we have in christ amen so god bless you for coming being with us today verse 20 of the chapter 11 of mark and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou curseth is withered away and jesus answered him said unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them then i would like to go down to revelation chapter 10 we'll read from verse 8 there this morning as we look into the precious word of god and its eternal truth and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and made it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and tongue nations and tongues and kings and that's why we're speaking today on under a mandate to speak amen god bless you you can have your seats brother branham said something very striking that i thought was very noteworthy to mention this morning in the message perseverance he refers to the scripture that we have read if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you say and then he said now i've said it now let it be done it is written to be spoken i have spoke it let it be done and as we think of that uh those words to me are really profound it is written to be spoken it's not written just to collect in a book it's not recognized written just for you to memorize but it is written for to be spoken jesus gave us a mandate to speak that when he told us we should speak to this mountain and we as a church of course have journeyed a long ways from this scripture for the early church was birthed by the word they cast out devils by the word they healed the sick by the word they saved souls by the spoken word they were mountain moving believers who operated with full authority as sons of god standing on the brink from going from mortal to immortality they were literally born speaking the wonderful works of god in all languages these newborn believers were born speaking in other tongues or other languages and they were declaring the wonderful works of god they were not just modern um nonsense or phrases that are in unintelligible they were but they were actually declaring and and and speaking of the wonderful works of god and they were doing this in all languages now i you know i've kind of had this in my own in my heart and on my chest for some for some services and and and if i bring it up again or again or again i i just believe it's something the holy spirit is wanting to emphasize to us but um you know we we have been on a long journey since the day of pentecost and the church has went through seven ages as went as typed in the scripture by seven churches of asia and that there were seven uh angels to that to those churches and and of course each one of them receiving a portion of the anointing of that one spirit as seven spirits of god would come to anoint those messengers in their day and their time and yet in this journey we we know that it's been typed as jesus and his parents went up to the feast of passover and they left him there and then they went on a journey without him and so as the church in their journey they left him not not just at the passover even though we could go back now to the passover and pentecost and calvary and the day of pentecost and just say that in in the journey we we the church has left christ at pentecost and luke chapter 2 verse 44 says but they supposing him to be among their company when a day's journey and they sought him among their kins folks and their and acquaintances and we have we went way more than a day's journey we went for now 2 000 years that the church has journeyed from the day of pentecost and i wonder today and and i don't want to be vindictive and and you know and even though some of my words may seem a bit harsh it is just to bring us to a recognition of our need of jesus that we need him more than ever and that he's missing today he is the missing element in most other religious circles today and and jesus yet he's the most important thing but but people are just supposing that jesus is somewhere in their churches and he's really not there at all his signs are not there his wonders are not there and finally his silence has become definite until they go looking for him among their kin folks the bible said they sought through him among their kindred and and you know we could ask of zusa street have you seen jesus no we we haven't seen him since we took tongues as our evidence and you know we still speak in tongues though but we can manufacture them anytime we want to but no we haven't seen jesus his signs his wonders his movement is not among us we ask the divine healing movement no he was once here he healed our sick and he opened the eyes of the blind and made the cripples walk but while we were arguing about who had the biggest tenth and the best magazine jesus went quietly away we we haven't seen him and and his miracles have ceased among us yes the method is now we we haven't seen him since the days of john wesley when they shouted and fell out in the spirit he was here then but we hadn't seen him in a long time you know where but we don't need him we have both the gays and women in the pulpit we have gay marriages and beautiful liturgy and beautiful formal religious worship so we have we have been so involved with that we haven't missed him you know we we hadn't noticed that he's not here you know brother branham saw this in a vision um when he saw the mountain of the great bread of life and he saw this great mountain before him and a door was opened into that mountain and he says he stepped in it he walked in through the door and was met by a woman who had a garment that might have been snow white at one time but now the garment was very spoiled and soiled and and she she asked this woman asked are you bill branham and he said i am so well i'm miss methodist and and he said well then i asked her why or why the spots on that lovely white garment and she replied i've been so busy and i said that's right your methodists have so many organizations and societies in your church that you have much time for the lord and then then again um he looked over to his left and he saw a small heap of smooth baked bread and there were white fowls that was standing near and they wouldn't eat much of it and the lord said to me do you know who do they know you know them and he said no that's your tabernacle and they won't eat the bread of life anymore you see you asked some of the message churches then have you seen jesus no we haven't even missed him we have been so caught up with following personality cults that we haven't noticed he isn't around today you see we you know we we um think we have the holy ghost without sensation so no we haven't seen him and we haven't heard him and we have not felt him you know ever it's been quite a while since we've seen a holy ghost move and anyway he's just a mystery that we preach and brother tabernacle how about you have you seen jesus and brother branham would say and answer that in god's chosen place of worship my friends i don't want to hurt your feelings but i'm responsible for a message and that messages come out of this mess and i ask you to come out and where am i going to take you to when i take you to the branham tabernacle it's as much fault as the rest of them but there's one place i can take you to where that you're safe and you're protected from death and that's in jesus christ god's place of worship and that's the place that i'm introducing you to tonight where god put his name where he promised he would meet every person that come in there he would worship with him and with and feast with him that's in christ not no church no tabernacle as sister collins saw in her dream and this has been this is told in services is the time but she had a dream that brother neville as the ministry was serving a wonderful meal in the church serving dinner in the church dinner's the evening meal and it was the best food she'd ever seen and she was hungry but she thought that he shouldn't serve it you see no one was to be allowed to preach but brother branham so they left and went to the wyatt to the ranch house and and when they you know when that kind of attitude came in and brought him a tabernacle the light went out on the right side and sadly the light is still out you listen to the warning that was given to them in a deceived church by the world and this this again is not vindictive of a of a certain church i'm talking about the message community in general because too often in our churches he is missing he is absent in the worship there's no joy in the church there's no shadow of the king everybody even his gifts that he would send is not welcome amen healings is almost non-existence and and preaching has been done against even the least of the gifts speaking in tongues and i don't know what you have to worry about most have never spoken tongues and brother badam said there to them in a deceived church by the world he said branham tabernacle worldliness is creeping upon you what about it have you exposed your secret have you exposed that secret that god gave you when you were wilder and there in the sawdust a few years ago have you let it creep out in formal worship what's happened to you god can come right down and perform a miracle and go right through the audience and tell people the secrets of their hearts and everything and heal the sick and afflict it and do signs and wonders and preach his word as hard as it can by the holy ghost and people say well i guess that was all right we enjoy listening to it once in a while if we're not too tired that's branham tabernacle the philistines is on thee when it used to be the preaching of the word and the old saints with the tears in their eyes would rise to the feed and walk sobbing maybe not saying a word just walking around two or three times and sat down so filled with the holy ghost the word fed them man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god the philistines is on the branham tabernacle philistines is on your pentecostal of course the philistine got the rest of you a long time ago when you organized yourself so tight nothing could come in unless you was a presbyterian baptist methodist catholic or something you wouldn't have nothing to do with the rest of them so revival in our day how can we have it when the regular revival giver is bound by the world god won't come in where the world is you just depend on that you associate with the world and that's all of it and then when you let the world creep in you go to acting like the world and then you're finished but when you cut loose ever fetter from the world and you come to god god will use you until you go to flirting again here's the only hope that i have this morning to wind up my message is this while samson was bound a new shock of hair grew out i'm glad that there's some kind of hope that we can look to that somebody in this age is going to find jesus that it won't be the neglected christ he will not be the one sitting with unwashed feet but he will be welcomed and honored and accepted in the house of god sadly on the the people on the journey they've never seen him let alone missed him and i had brother branham would say i feel sorry for the people today many thousands of people in this nation that's belong to dozens of different churches trying to find where jesus is they go down to one certain church they check there they go to another they check there they find out something's wrong they don't act like and believe like and worship like there's no sound of the king in the camp there's no joy and he says i might say this if there was one thing i find in the pentecostal people that makes me believe they're certainly outstanding christians it's not because they're speaking in tongues or they get the signs of divine healing it's the joy that they have they just have no embarrassment they just let their hair down their hair and start to rejoice because there's something they're not ashamed of and that makes me believe there's something outstanding about them they're not ashamed they just soon shout out there in the street as it would in the church and if a hundred people are there laughing at them they wouldn't stop a bit they'd continue on shouting joy find them on the mission field starved to death almost i've seen them with no shoes on their feet living over 30 cents a week preaching the gospel brother just as happy as you are coming to the church in the limousine they're happy for they found something that means more than creed denomination or church affiliation they found what it takes to bring joy and a christian should be happy we we were prayed for that our joys might be full that was jesus prayer you remember it's something about it that's real now if we lost that joy if we lost those things if we can't find them among our kindred we can't find them then there's one thing to do and let's go back to where we left him at amen and the church should go back to the beginning where they left him because that's exactly what mary and joseph did they left jesus at the feast of pentecost and that's where mary and joseph left jesus now let me say this with all due consideration respect that's where both catholic and protestants left jesus at the feast of pentecost and you can't find him searching around here through creeds and denominations the denomination and creates all should go back to the beginning amen that's where the church will find him again you go back to the feast of pentecost you go back to the pouring out of the holy ghost and there you'll find the power of almighty god and you'll find a risen christ you'll you'll find signs and wonders of him just exactly like he said he would be amen you've got to go back to where you left him out go back to the beginning that's why there needs to be a return to a real upper room experience where men and women stagger under the influence of new wine why they ain't enough grapes or fruit on the vine to maybe to even make new wine today amen this is the deal jesus said very clearly in john 15 he said you are the i'm the vine you are the branches and the branch comes out of the vine and they wrote a book of acts behind it amen they had power to heal the sick they spoke with tongues they interpreted they had visions they had prophets power they'd done great signs that jesus did and if the first branch come out of that vine was that kind of a branch the next branch that comes out it'll bear the same kind of fruit amen because every branch it bears will be the same branch hallelujah they receive energy from the root amen i say let the root of david spring forth amen let that branch bring forth a man to produce the same fruits on the vine that the early church did because if we're going to be the branch that came out of the vine we had to bear a record of that branch amen the first branch came forth was a pentecostal branch amend the people and i'm i'm just going to quote this from brother branham he said that first branch that came forth was a pentecostal branch filled with the pentecostal power so impacted by the holy spirit until they staggered under the impact of the power of god that went forth and they saw visions performed and fought performed miracles and opened the eyes of the blind heal the sick joy was in the camp they prayed with one accord and all of them assembled are together until the building shook where they assembled together show me a church doing that today even the pentecost was so called is getting so dry while you have a little ceremonial prayer i wonder what he'd say about message churches today what an indictment would we get he said what we need is a prayer meeting that'll shake the shingles off the top of the house and bring god back in the church again amen oh my church that's exactly what it was it was a church filled with the spirit they healed the sick they prophesied they did great signs and wonders that wasn't ashamed of their religion amanda shouted and danced unto the spirit like drunk men amen and clothing tongues of fire sat down upon them and they began to speak in other languages the bible said all languages under heaven declaring the wondrous works of god amen it's about time the church again amen declares and speaks again to every nation to every kindred to all every tongue declaring the wonderful works of god that he's the same yesterday today or ever that he's still alive among us that he still heals us sick he casts out devils he still dwells upon his people hallelujah they've done signs and exploits they man they were there was that kind of a church at the beginning and that was the kind that they were in the middle that's the kind they're going to be in the end amen oh yeah but you know again today that kind of god is missing that kind of message that produces that kind of results is missing in too many churches dead churches with dead preachers given for dead sermons and these dead sermons kill amen now so where is the church been from for the past seven ages they've been on a journey to get back to jesus and to get back to jesus it would take malachite forward to turn us back to the faith of the fathers amen now we know that we left as a church as a church we're not talking about evening life here we're talking about a church all christianum it left jesus at pentecost and we know now we are living in the last age and if this age doesn't get back to jesus ain't nobody gonna get back to jesus because we're the last runners we're the last ones of the race and there must be a people get back to jesus again get back to the real spirit of god and the power of god not just in the pulpit but in the pew power that is in prayer power that is in men and women's voices declaring the wonderful works of god where the manifestation of the holy spirit flows through them laodicea was is to be i'm quoting this from the church's book laodicean is to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at pentecost to do this we know there must be of necessity be a return of dynamic power now if you haven't if you haven't returned to continuing the book of acts if the dynamic power is not there you're still on the journey and you haven't found him yet again quoting from the church age book which he references this scripture the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost at pentecost men with us filled with the spirit spoke as the spirit gave them utterance i want you to notice it was not men saying whatever they desire but the spirit was giving them utterance amen it repeats in the last day when the spirit comes down with the open book and as he does the silence is broken amen and the mysteries are revealed and as the people receive it and eats it up and digests it that they will do like they did at pentecost they'll be so filled with the spirit until they will prophesy again amen amen that's the spirit gives the mutterings out of every tongue and tribe and nation and people to all the world this is a mandate to speak thou must prophesy again in the fifth seal brother branham said this and you know i'm linking this with moving the mountain spoken word third paul the fifth seal brother branham said i i believe i'm not gonna say it and speak it in his name i'm gonna speak it in the revelation of my faith what happened in sabino canyon the other day you know what that was was a sword that was the word coming to a prophet amen here again i believe that the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the creator i believe if he can make a squirrel appear that has no and and here is a man or woman just a part missing and not a complete animal itself oh he's god i love him now the prophet isaiah he screamed out in isaiah 53 and 1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed now this may seem to be a strange connection with uh with these other scriptures that i'm bringing but i want you to think of it like this god is the spirit and as a spirit he has no arm amen in revelation it depicts his sword being in his mouth so it is the word of god that is in that the arm of god comes forth in power and works through words amen he comes out of god's mouth his word is his arm his word would become flesh in jesus who would be god's arm of salvation [Music] and it would be the spoken word the original seed the word may flesh and dwelt among us by the word the worlds were framed together by the word of god not with the sweat of the brow that was spoken from from his mouth but adam dominated and controlled the earth he dressed the garden and by the gods powerful arm of the word amen and moses did the same by that powerful arm of the word coming out of the prophet's mouth amen it brought mighty egypt to her knees i want you to know it was because a man under the blood speaking are you with me amen it was adam you know before sin a sinless man before sin entered the picture that was authorized to use the word to bring dominion upon the earth by that word he he moved mountains he he uh he could move and as trees he could dress the garden any way that he wanted to by the word he'll be in harmony with god's word and god's plan are you with me now but isaiah is looking for somebody to believe i want to say that again isaiah is saying who hath believed our report he is saying who is it that believes amen who has believed i report for the arm of the lord can only be revealed to those who believe so until the bride returns back to the word in faith again the arm of the lord cannot be revealed in his power no matter how great the word is and how dynamic it is and how power-packed it is it must have faith to operate that word [Applause] there has to be a connection now so isaiah was looking for somebody who has believed i report i'm looking for someone to believe the report if i can get somebody to believe the report then to them the arm of the lord will be revealed all right now jesus spoke these words to martha now we'll go to jesus who was the arm of the lord on display on the earth remember again we're speaking about the mandate to speak and it's going to be demonstrated now through the word himself and john in john 11 40 jesus says his word to martha he said said i not unto thee that thou that if thou wouldest believe thou should have see the glory of god again the glory of god being seen there is a requirement of somebody finding somebody that will believe it now again it doesn't matter how how the word is restored in its purity and in its fullness if god can't get somebody to believe come on amen then the word will never be of any benefit it's like gasoline stored in a cab it's got all the acting and all the power but it has no dynamic to set it a fire the power is in the word but it takes the faith the spark of faith to cause it to come forth somebody in this age has got to start believing jesus pondered and wondered as he looked forward into this age and he said i wonder when the son of man cometh will i find church members well i find great deep theologians will there be all great mysteries and and and great teachings going on of these mysteries will i find faith will i find somebody to believe the report because only where the people starts believing come on now church that's why we got to wake jesus in our midst because we got to start believing again there's got to be a people return to faith and have an expectancy that he is the resurrection and the life jesus said in john 11 40 if thou wouldest believe didn't i say to you if thou would as believe thy should have see the glory of god once again to see god's glory displayed somebody's got to believe i hear brother branham describe martha in the sermon uncertain sound and he said first thing you know little old martha come running out there and said lord oh i like that and if she she titled him what he was and when he was her lord if that would have been here my brother would not have died see but even now whatever you ask god god will give it to you there was nothing uncertain about it amen and then and i want you to get a point here and we'll elaborate it on in a minute but no matter how much jesus had the vision no matter how much he had the word come on no matter how much he wants the word somebody had to believe to see the glory of god amen that's where the church must return back to the word in faith and that way she will see the dynamic power of god somebody's got to start expecting god to move again to heal our sin to repulse cancer to stop coping in his track amen your name your disease your name your affliction your name to sin amen somebody's got to start believing again there's got to be an expectancy and with that expectancy comes a joy because when you expect him to move there's a joy in your heart saying i know you're going to do something whatever you ask god god's going to do it we're going to see the spirit move we're going to see the holy ghost out we're going to see the dynamics come to the mechanic and make that word live brother branham said that's where two positives meet that when that's when true omnipotence meets when one omnipotence she had she had omnipotent faith in christ what did she say whatever you ask god it's unlimited it's unlimited jesus it's unlimited she's confessing it before she even sees her brother raised from the dead she's confessing whatever you ask god he will do it amen she had omnipotent faith in an omnipotent christ we got an omnipotent christ right here it's the word come on amen she had omnipotent faith in christ and christ was omnipotency she had perfect omnipotent faith in our infinite faith in christ that he was the lord and knew whatever he asked god god would give it to him in other words she said you just speak the word that's all you have to do whatever you ask god god will give it all to you you don't speak it amen oh that the holy spirit would speak we've seen enough of man speaking come on we've seen enough of the bumbles of man and the fallacy of man but oh that men and women could come again moved by the holy ghost now that uh that's omnipotence all powerful because he just said so and he was all-powerful that's when two powers two omnipotent powers meets together it's a contact then notice a connection i want you to get to stop a connection a contact a connection when a line has got here 150 volts and this has 150 volts and when they come together you got a 150 votes both ways and when you get supreme power when jesus said lay hands on the sick they shall recover and you've got supreme faith and that being this the truth you need a supreme god that made a supreme promise and a supreme result will come amen now brother branham told us that as he pondered this scripture about speaking if you say not if i say but if you say to this mountain and he said he he began to wonder you know and ponder well perhaps you know that was not in the atonement this was before the atonement was even done and you know so jesus said these words and now after the atonement maybe it's not affected and the holy spirit dropped down and said to him but that's in the atonement i want you to know this the power of the spoken word is not something new or added or just for william brannon's ministry amen amen but it was in the atonement it's for everyone in the covenant under the blood are you with me amen that's in the atonement for a man or if a man or a woman is so consecrated and surrendered to god that god just moves in and uses their voice and it isn't the man speaking it's god's that's in him speaking hallelujah because only deity could move a mountain so it'd have to be god in the man speaking through the man there not a human over here blabbering and going on and trying to work up something but the holy spirit work in preeminence with preeminence in a people till he has control of their tongue like he did on the day of pentecost and they and the spirit gave them utterance are you ready to become a surrendered person amen so surrendered and and consecrated to god that god moves in and uses their voice and it isn't the man speaking it's god that's speaking in him and he said oh i thought that's right i'm gonna just say oh that we could be a people that the holy ghost could speak through he's gonna have a voice amen there's a voice of god the spirit and the bride say the bride is saying something come on church she is saying something amen there is a utterance coming out of her mouth she is saying something the bride says something amen revelation revelation 10 and 8 shows the bride is saying something she prophesies she utters under inspiration she's speaking under an anointing hallelujah and a mighty angel has come down and an anointing has come down it anointed a prophet it loosed the seals it broke the silence it opened the book somebody helped me preach now amen but it did more than that it empowers a people to speak of people under the anointing [Applause] not a people void of the anointing not ministry that is dry and just a theological exposition but the word going forth in power the gospel preached not taught but preached and when it's preached signs follow them that believe i suggest you you pick a different sermon to go to sleep on this morning amen the spirit of god's trying to awaken you yes sir and he said something said to me what do you think how do you see those visions and things on the platform how do you see those visions out there what is it you think it's your own wisdom that you could predict something that would happen every time to the letter do you think that's you speaking no that's why he said you know that wasn't me speaking that was him using my voice [Music] and when he's speaking that i'm the voice of god to you amen now brother branham explains it this way he said well you know the the spirit is now speaking to him about his question about the scripture mark 16 or our 11 24 and and here he's he is he's been he's questioned god and said well you know i i never understood that maybe it's just before the atonement and god comes down and corrects his thinking no it's in the atonement and he said it's no different to when you speak unto the anointing and there you begin to tell people their name their address whether you think that's you speaking that's me speaking through you and and and again it was the spirit giving him utterance somebody with me amen now so again you know he said you've got yourself so completely surrendered to god he explains this in this um in this fellowship through uh reconciliation of the blood he said someone with thousands of times said thousands of times brother branham what does it mean when you feel your own life move away from you and something sets in and takes its place he said why it's a fellowship it's marvelous you know that you're not yourself no more you got yourself completely surrendered to god and it's not you talking it's him talking it's not you doing anything you're so happy to know he's doing it and it's such a love about it till you can hardly contain your joy hardly and to to know that god is doing something for the people now you think that that is for the prophet alone but i want you to look in matthew 10 and 19 for when they deliver you up take no thought about what you shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak you're going to speak but it's going to be given to you amen for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father that speaketh in you hallelujah i i'm preaching something that's a possibility to ever say amen for the spirit of god to speak to speak through individuals hallelujah and even brother brad i'm in the token he said you create such an atmosphere that when you speak to your son or your daughter that wayward child that they'll just they'll just fall right into it why because it isn't you speaking it is the father speaking through you amen a man or woman surrendered to god listen in my new ministry we'll pick it up again he said what would you think sometimes the holy spirit gets in a message and you don't know what to say what is it speaking then what is it when a man will speak in tongues he doesn't know nothing about it what is it when the one one will interpret that same tongue neither of them knowing anything about it it's the individual or it's or is it the individual or is it the spirit of the living god and that was the holy spirit speaking to them he said the holy spirit telling brother branham the holy spirit takes preachers over unto the point that he will speak and dawned and don't even know what to say but the holy spirit will actually utter through him this happened brother joe hadn't it that happened brother timothy hadn't happened by there that's what we call the anointing amen the anointing comes down and we say things that we never thought of saying we never even understood before he just flows right out amen what is it he said when one was speaking tongues in a language he knows nothing about another will interpret that same language amen he said the spirit of god speaking brother brighter now is it the individual or is it the spirit of the living god and he said that's true it's god that's speaking and all the church needs i'll finish this next week amen all the church needs do you want to know what we need to do this amen he is a step closer to him of a more consecrated life to live with him that's what brother bradham said we are standing under the blood of jesus christ and that blood has not only cleansed our sins it's taken the seals off the book it was done by bloody lamb by the work of an intercessor and he said we're standing under that blood under a complete atonement and he said that gives us that empowers us to speak speak words of creation now notice this patma's vision he said amen cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected what's this word again connected like in the garden of eden now man i was going to choke it but i'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent did not he say in mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you said what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together to amen omnipotence something's got to shake amen whatever you say with that creative power the omnipotence of god knowing he promised it and he said in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met amen here again brother bradham is showing you an example there with with with martha and he shows their martha her faith omnipotent faith in an omnipotent god connected together and when it did it calls the creative power of omnipotence to go out and a man that was dead in the grave four days rose again hallelujah because faith was connected with omnipotence the omnipotent word amen and the omnipotent faith of a starter of god brought the truth together and when the connection was made that dead was raised oh that the people's faith would be connected with the promise today come on amen if you remember the story of lazarus and saint john's gospel let's just deviate for a moment let's just discover this a little bit about martha there there there for two days jesus had lingered beyond jordan he was urgently needed they're back at bethany where were lazarus was dying he was fading fast and you can imagine the tears that were flowing not just because of the sickness and and the death of lazarus whom jesus loved but there was a heartache that was true in in the hearts of the of the those that believed in him because because jesus did not come when called there was a delayed response on the part of their dearest friend and the only hope that they had who never came neither did he send any word was silent but you see we're in the days of the breaking of the silence we're in the hour where the resurrected christ comes walking among us the i am come on oh yes he he was there in the prophet's ministry but he's got to be here in the bride's ministry amen yeah yep there and let me just say again friend his delay the delay of his coming it causes bitter tears to be weep amen when people who love his appearing they want to see him appear they want him up here in the service they want him appearing in their lives they want him appearing in the songs they want him appearing in the sermons they must have his appearing and when jesus don't come better tears should be wet from the church because she's our only hope and we can only have joy when he's here because when he ain't here there is no joy yet jesus is aware of all this he's been aware too he's been aware the church would go through seven ages he's been aware in the last days we'll return to be the bride of pentecost he's aware it's the hour it's the time and we've already seen him in his appearing amen come on now jesus knew that sickness had become death and he said our friend lazarus sleepeth and he had been silent now for days about lazarus and no doubt is a man remember we preached last sunday that jesus is not only god but he was man and as the man he was communicating with the father inside him so that he could do the father's will as a human he had other desires amen come on amen he would have to surrender those desires completely at gethsemane and say not my will but thine be done so he could show the human had a will but god had a will oh yeah the new birth does not take away human will you still have a will that's got to be surrendered up to god's will are you with me amen so he he knew and jesus had been silent for days about lazarus but he's about to break the silence i want you to get it back again we're in the hour of the breaking of the silence not only the silence of the seal but again a people who have been silenced now speaking prophesying again get these thoughts together as i try to weave them into one message and thought this morning he'd been silent for days about lazarus and as a man he was communing with the father inside him and brother branham said if jesus had to pray earnestly how much more do we have to pray earnestly and he said he prayed earnestly to stay in contact with the spirit that was in him i wonder if that's not the failure of the church they are not they are not communicating with the spirit the holy ghost inside of them man men and women should be led by the spirit of god directed by the holy ghost moved by the spirit the bible said in him we live and we move and we have our being that is the life of a christian of people who are moved by the spirit jesus now gets a vision because the father had showed him he knew now the purpose lazarus had died he was not there not allowed to to to to heal him to go minister to him because this would show his messiahship and that he was lord over the dead and now once he knew once he saw the vision he starts out for the home of mary and martha and he knew now that god had granted him the life of lazarus his friend and he says i go to awake him amen because you know and he says for this reason i'm glad i wasn't there you know because i had to wait for the fulfillment of the vision you see i couldn't raise him up before time and they would've been pulling on me and saying pray for him and they're faithful but i have to find faith amen there has to be some of someone that will connect with the nation oh that happier people connect with this prophecy today in revelation 10 8 of a people eating the book and therefore prophesying again of people uttering by the spirit moved by the holy ghost this resurrection of lazarus as i said would prove he was lord of the dead that he was indeed the god of the resurrection jesus knew that the arm of the lord would be made bare and laid there and the power of the resurrection would be made known this would pre-figure even the dead in christ rising it would pre-figure in some ways his own resurrection and he was had the power to take life up again yet still after all the vision can i bring it to you after all the prophecies after all the promises in the word amen after the vision being given to him he still must have the cooperation of someone's faith that somebody got to believe the report because it's only when people start believing that the arm of the lord can be revealed [Applause] i'm not trying to preach that you believe that i can do it i'm trying to preach to say that you can do it that you can be the consecrated dedicated sanctified holy ghost field church moved by the power of god somebody has got to start looking at the promise with faith with an expectancy it was a martyr that he would discover this faith now we wouldn't have really been surprised to find it mary because she sat at his feet and she's drinking in every word and surely she would be prepared for this moment to be full of faith this this mary we my goodness she was she was just always sitting at his feet and drinking in every word but martha it's just like you she was busy about other things she had to go push a pen on monday morning figure out numbers as an accountant said to prepare a lesson for the school where you would teach you had go get a job i'm trying to tell you this is not out of your reach [Music] say brother tim i don't have the hours and the time necessary to dare to sit in and drink and drink and be this woman of faith that's not what he found in martha what he found in martha was a woman who was busy hey man she was busy about other things she had been too busy to sit at his feet she was more worried about meal preparation and the busyness of life she had a family to take care of and here martha showed her real character amen and her real faith that she believed that jesus was the messiah the son of god the long expected redeemer amen and mountain shows us that we sometimes can be so overcome with life and the business of life that even though we are that kind of people in laodicea [Applause] amen we're self reaches and pleasures and all these distractions and cell phones and and the internet and all the other distractions amen oh and but they are capable you are capable of having great faith [Music] i'm preaching as brother branham and god of this evil age said to that faith woman the bride amen the faith woman the promises put before that brother shall rise again you know faith feeds on the promises come on you know you're over here looking at how little your faith is don't look at how little your faith is faith as a creative mustard seed can move a mountain quit looking at how little your faith is start looking at how big your god is how true are his promises that he never fails that his promises are omnipotent that there's power that is in his blood we're looking at how little your faith is and look how big god's promise is hallelujah and that the promise is not just to you but it's through your children and to them that are far off and any as many as the lord our god shall call hallelujah the promise is put before her thy brothers shall rise again the promises but before you behold i show you a mystery you will not all sleep but you shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye hallelujah and then the promise is the dead in christ arise and we're in the age for it the promise is and we shall all be changed from mortals to immortality the promise hallelujah i don't know if i want to preach in english or other tongues right now but oh let the spirit utter that's a spirit's peace hallelujah let him speak through us hallelujah the promise is put before thy brothers shall rise again faith feeds on the promises of light wood that is throat on the flame feeds the fire faith will burst forth and flame high when it feeds on the promises if we look at circumstances we'll stagger we will fall amen i i cannot look at the circumstances of our brother ron spencer and what he's going through i cannot look at those circumstances even though even though we get little promises and hopes and things that are dropped to us a little bit of time this week you know one of the great things that happens some months ago he went to to a an eye doctor and they looked in his eye and said here there's cancer in your eyes said this melanoma we believe it started there and there with this melanoma in your eyes said we think it spread from there to other things and you got melanoma in your eyes he goes back for another eye exam this week and they said no we don't think it started there because there ain't even any cancer in your eyes last night he was having a heart attack and they rushed him to the er before he can get there all the symptoms are gone they are baffled don't know what it was don't understand what it was but you see the devil comes in on one side and on another but when the saints get to pray things start changing because when omnipotent faith quits looking at the circumstances and looks at the promise it can only be enough faith when it looks at the promise otherwise when it looks at the circumstances it's only unbelievable but today we stagger not at the promise of god through unbelief but we're strong in the faith declaring our god raised i'm not healed i'm not delivered i not saying that god is the same yesterday the day and forever i god is a living god he's the i am and this is why we must keep the word of god in our hearts amen we must feed upon it take this book and eat this book digest this book don't spit it up it'll make your belly bitter but don't spit it out keep it down if you keep it down it's going to come out his words and when it comes out his word it's going to be divine word it's going to be mountain movement words it's going to be more hallelujah it's going to be words amen that close down the wall it'll be words that'll open up the red sea it'll be words that cause the dead and pasteurized it'll be the word in power [Applause] hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah take a moment to worship him it's okay amen it's time that we break out in joy amen because we have returned back to the promise back to the face [Applause] you can have your seats that's why we must keep the word of god upon our hearts we must feed upon it faith cometh by hearing listen to the report hear the report believe the report that report will influence your faith amen it'll cause you to believe amen and by it you'll see the revealing and the bearing of his mighty arm of power [Music] martha believed that lazarus would indeed rise again she believed he would raise at the last day but she had no faith in the immediate resurrection of the body that laid in the tomb and jesus would have to adjust her faith from a faith that will work tomorrow to a faith that works today [Applause] are you with me amen and jesus said but i am the resurrection and the life and martha already knew right there you know right here is power because he would say martha already already you don't have to wait on the power you don't have to wait on the power of the resurrection that awaits the dead it's coming yes and i'm going to just say there will be a resurrection in the end time yes there'll be the power god demonstrated in the last days yes it will change our bodies oh men will become young again oh women will become young women again prosthesis will be no longer needed false teeth will go by the way of the ancients and of the discards you'll step from mortal to immortality but friends there is still the resurrection of life now that if he can do that in the body then he can heal your body now because this is the earnest of that for if there is no divine healing there is no resurrection i am the resurrection in life resurrection power is here jesus says i am it amen and though a man were dead yet shall he live and he said believeth out this he's saying martha if i can get you to believe you will see the resurrection but two omnipotents must work together they must connect the word of the vision has power in it but there must be a power of faith to unite with it to bring it to pass because i am not just in your future but i am the i am think of the voice of this i am it is the present tense of the eternal are you with me amen at the bad after burning bush it was moses first introduction to god and the first lesson that moses had to learn god is the i am he is here he is able he is willing to ought to do all that he promises to do now amen the future is now amen men are ready to postpone it and put it off in the future and we'll have the power of god one day but i want you to know the future is now god is blessing the past and he will bless in the future that is the truth amen we can preach sermons on how god blessed in the past we can preach sermons on how god will bless in the future god did the miraculous in his first coming and he will repeat them in his second coming but what we want to believe is that the presence is now but the problem is is people believe the presence the present is when god is absent did you hear me that's the problem they think god will be in the future oh yeah yeah they think god was in the past oh yeah yeah but right now he's absent and doing nothing god wants us to believe him as the i am come on that's how he wants you to believe he wants to that's what he was doing in this day doing the miracle doing the miraculous showing himself with signs and wonders vindicating a prophet to show you that i am god oh my gosh said oh yes lord you know one day my brother will rise again there's no doubt about it he was a good boy he was a wonderful boy and i believe he lived a good life and he he offered to shed blood and yeah he'll rise again in his time and it in his lot when the resurrection takes place oh you know mata martha could could say oh yeah he could he'll rise again but where is that martha who will say even now whatever you ask god he will do it that's his message today amen i am the resurrection to the dead i am the more the abundant life to all who live and believe in me come on church like martha god wants to arouse your expectancy amen so you can see his mighty arm being revealed you can see his word spoken out of the mouse of his elect and his arm may bear as they triumph over their enemy amen oh my there again he arouses their expectancy and says roll away the stone you got something to do to prove it you've got something you've got to do roll away the hindrance oh yeah he could have spoke and he had cracked the stone in two and splints and shouted into oblivion into a billion pieces and lives was coming forth but god said mel mata you moved the stone amen you moved the hindrance amen you roll away everything and prepare for god to do the miraculous it's time that we as a church roll away the theologies that keeps the dead dead come on remember we roll away the ideas of man and our own unbelief roll it all away open it up let god's word flow freely amen we've hindered it long enough we've held it back long enough it's time now to let the word of god float freely it's time now for the dead to come out of the grave for god to do the miraculous [Applause] martha's faith was to be the conduit to bring jesus and her dead brother together and death couldn't hold him no more because when martha's faith and you know was the conduit to bring jesus and connect him they meant to bring jesus and connect him to the dead body of her brother charges begin to fly dynamo began to happen and a man that was in the grave four days began to rise up out of that grave come on church hey man because she was the the the conduit and and and it brought it brought her faith was a conduit to bring the vision and and the dead together why corruption brother branham would often say corruption knew his master the soul knew its maker and a man that was dead four days to it at the voice of him who is the great i am [Applause] i'm saying to you today let your faith be the link between the power of god and the death that holds your body in sickness amen marta's faith linked and connected the omnipotence of god with the dead body of lazarus and your faithful link can unless the power of any divine promise in any situation god was showing us with lazarus they the case that that is too hard they ain't a problem that is too corrupted amen there is no body that's been too sick there isn't a sickness too great there is not a time when it's out of time because this god is an old time god and he's a god who moves beyond the circumstances of man that brings together the the faith of man and connects it with the promise of god and the dead itself will rise [Music] [Applause] [Music] martha's faith linked and connected with the omnipotence of god and connected that with the dead body of lazarus and your faithful link and unless the power of any divine promise with the need in any situation are you with me amen let's go on it's been said it's been said no faith no blessing little faith little blessing great faith great blessing according to our faith so it is always done to us you see the saving might of god's mighty arm either might be nearby and waiting close amen but it's there for the purpose of delivered but it's inoperable unless we are connected to it by faith this is why isaiah expounds this the negative side of this truth he said he uses the negative it says you know he complains that the arm of the lord is not revealed because men have not believed the inspired report amen the one in john however declares there which we read about in martha that it declares from the lips of jesus that those who believe shall see the glory of god so one of them is extolling the negative and saying look here here's the problem the reason why that you haven't seen the arm of god is because you hadn't believed it doesn't matter that he was wounded for your transgression if you don't believe it it doesn't believe that you're the matter that your iniquities are forgiven if you don't believe it a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon it doesn't matter how much that the arm of the lord has power unless the report is believed amen the report is god's word amen he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity and he is born our sickness our grace and by his stripes we were healed the report says that god laid on christ the iniquity of us all amen amen the report says that you're amen the report says that the worthy lamb has made you worthy that the book that john was unworthy to look upon once it was interceded and taken by the lamb then he was commanded to take it the book he could look at is now the book that is being taken because of the blood of the lamb who had believed this report that if you believe that report then do you the arm of the lord will be revealed but it will never happen unless you believe amen the arm of the lord is the power of christ and it cannot be revealed until the report is believed amen amen you know the report the report is they can't find him the report is he's missing from the churches the report is they haven't seen him now if you believe that you won't look there anymore amen if you believe that you'll go back to where he was left and find him there hallelujah if you believe that report you'll find jesus at pentecost again you'll find that he's still the same jesus amen that what he says confounds the priest and then he hills are sick it casts out devils it raises the dead it doesn't miraculous you'll find he's still the same god that he was in the book of acts this is what the arm of the lord can do but it must be connected with faith to do so john 11 40 said i not to thee if thou disbelieve thou shall receive the glory of god you see god's arm when it's outstretched and it's laid bare it has enormous power you know the spirit doesn't have an arm come on somebody help me preach this morning come on the spirit doesn't have an arm this is this is an analogy that is given where where it speaks of the the spirit of god doing a work on the earth when he says with his abstract arm amen this is the spirit of god moving through his people he has no hands but your hands no feet but your feet no eyes but your eyes no arm but your arms no mouth but your mouth he would have to borrow a prophet's body to speak through in this day amen to get a message across to you if it's of any count it has to borrow my body to preach a sermon [Applause] he borrows my body to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen he borrows the body of believers [Music] and he can do that because of the blood before calvary he would have to create a body and step in it but after calvary he is sanctified by what offers amen all of us forever i said forever amen he can borrow your body and you ought to be a person say god here's my body here's my bless here i am i want to surrender smile to you that you can speak for me live for me after me that you can manifest your glory branham was straight and stand there in the platform and he said now jesus is sitting on the right hand of god and he cannot come because when he comes he says we'll be changed but he says right now he can't come but he can come and borrow my body oh that there be a people today that would yield their bodies their members people who would pray until it wasn't them talking anymore but the spirit now talking through them god's arm when it's outstretched and laid bare is given in the scripture it signifies the energy of the most high it's first used when god speaks to moses and says i will redeem them with an outstretched arm and after crossing the red sea there were two million voices that were rejoicing with glad triumphant shouts and miriam would dance because the arm of the lord was revealed and such power that it held back the red sea and then it let it flood back destroying their enemy hallelujah oh i tell you church when that arm of the lord starts being revealed and you begin to see he's god the same yesterday today and forever like it was that day when i was preaching february the 18th when sister atlanta ran around this platform coming out of this uh this congregation coming out from the mezzanine you remember it amen what was it what was it she saw the arm of the lord in power that there was a bible jesus a bible god a bible doctrine a bible truth and we had returned back to a bible church hallelujah and when she saw her enemy was dead she ran around and around the building rejoicing [Applause] [Music] hallelujah last sunday when the choir was singing jesus is mine jesus's mind there's a name that is written in glory and it's mine oh yes it's mine people begin to rejoice and run around this building you know why because they saw and i am god they saw jesus's mind they saw he's not a distant god but he's a present god i'll tell you what when my wife ran around this room here last sunday she went back home a new woman and been cleaning her house and cooking and helping around the place with a renewed energy because jesus is mine jesus is mine but oh there's a name written in glory and it's mine oh yes it's mine hallelujah we've seen him put hair back when the doctor said there could be no hair we've seen heal the blinded eyes we've seen him restore we've seen him come and change lives we've seen him come and move because when you get a look at the i am god and you see him as the same yesterday today and forever then you begin to see his power on display the arm of the lord revealed and the next day there was no cancer revealed in sister atlantis a man in her chart no cancer why the arm of the lord had been laid bare and the arm of the lord had dealt a death blow to cancer and the prophecy had come forth in the pulpit your enemy is dead your enemy is dead your enemy is dead i'll tell you that's not a god of yesterday that is a god of the i am he is the god present the god our killer the god with an outstretched heart when somebody will believe it [Applause] hallelujah he'll make merriam dancers you're going to make joy in the camp it'll make the shot of the king it'll put joy unspeakable and full of glory it'll put where people can't sit in their seats anymore because they are extol in the great power of the almighty god that he is not a dead god but he's the same god that we have found him at pentecost that we have found him in the book of acts that we have found him in paul's gospel and we have returned miriam could dance because the arm of the lord was revealed in such power that it held back the red sea and then let it flood back destroying the enemy throughout the old testament it's a common phrase that points and prophets of israel describing god's redeeming power the barn with the barred arm of god throughout on the bible it is called to awake oh my to awaken would have to give out on me this time i'm not through yet amen throughout the bible the arm of god is called on to awake and put on strength amen throughout bible history because of the unbelief of israel think about it because of their unbelief the arm of god would lay inoperable amen and other times when faith was present it would reveal itself and vigorous and effective and powerful with strength how there's a direct relationship between god's strength of his saving might and faith god's great arm was revealed at the red sea making a path through its depths only to rest and sleep while israel wandered in the wilderness because they believed not his word in the days of joshua the arm of the lord was revived again it was revealed in power at the river jordan amen it would divide that river asunder when it was at flood stage isn't this amazing god doesn't wait until it's just a trickle going through he waits until his flood states hey man he makes a passage for the children of israel god a lot of times do that for you he'll wait till it gets a flood you think it can't get no worse than this and here comes another you can't think it'll not get any worse than this and here comes another amen but it's in those kind of times that jesus shows up on the scene and bears his mighty arm amen he would he would there he would make a passage through the reds or through the to the the jordan river it would throw down the walls of jericho amen it would chase and flight the armies of the aliens it would stop the sun and hold it back hold back the darkening shadows of the night and give a promised land to a chosen race because joshua never wavered in his faith but again it would sink paralyzed and powerless to rest during the days of the judges when people cease to exercise the faith to which nothing was impossible whenever the fire of faith would gleam and it would sometimes spark up from those ashes during the days of gideon and bayrack and jephthah and samson instantly the arm of the lord was made bear you'd see god coming within the days of gideon he said it's not going to be my mighty power i can't use what you got i can't use those that are fearful and unafraid afraid i cannot use those who are bound to idols i cannot use that let me get just a remnant let me get 300 i found 300 and with 300 i'm gonna i'm going to destroy the millions of the midianites because if i can get to 300 believing is a lot better than thousands upon thousands of those that are bowing their knee to bail and those who are fearful and unfun for and are afraid i say if you're afraid go home i say if you're without courage it's time to leave this is the hour for the courageous this is for the hour for the people who know their god amen who are confident in that god because they them kind will be the kind that does exploits are you with me amen so again it would be it would be revealed in the days when david david's faith realized that the living god was still amongst his people and he was well able to save without without a coat of mail or spear or a shield or a sword but in the following days of those faithless kings the arm of the lord becomes dormant and allowed the enemies of god to overtake and they would enslave god's chosen people we're taught in the book of hebrews that all the exploits and and episodes of god's people they were all due to faith which believed that god was a present source he was a rewarder those that diligently seek him when jesus came dawn of the lord was in him for he was the fullness of the godhead bodily jesus never worked a miracle unless there was faith exhibited the centurion the series the syranesian woman you know no matter who it was she was this symphonising woman was accounted as a dog there was a leper who he was an outcast of that society but they could only draw virtue from him that would heal them and deliver them and save them if they believed and they did this while the bulk of the rest of the nation and especially those of his childhood friends down in nazareth would miss the blessings of seeing god's arm revealed they've missed seeing his great power manifested because of their unbelief jesus could do no mighty miracles among them i'll assert today that the terrible conditions that we're finding in the world is due because of his persistent unbelief unbelief is that it's all times high amen uh our our nation has went in his democracy with his freedoms to the extremes to freedoms that was never even intended by the original uh the original writers of the and authors of the constitution they never dreamed they would take freedom to the extent that men would marry men and women marry women they never took it to the extent of thinking that that you know that your freedom would mean the right to kill the unborn when they had written laws to protect the very citizenship of the of the nation amen we we have sunk down so low in unbelief and today what can you believe there is the sodom is clamoring at the door you can see it there even the righteous who are trying to stand for some type of of being conservative and under and they're they're gathering outside of their homes they're knocking at their doors they're writing down their streets amen they're they're doing exactly what they did in the days of sodom and gomorrah and don't think that that canada is exempt because if america is sodom day or gomorrah right now they're they're pushing a bill in the nation of canada that if it passed then that to them then churches would receive thousands of dollars of fines for preaching against homosexual lifestyles or refusing to to to uh honor gay marriages they are forcing their their so-called rights in the face of everybody else are you with me sodom and gomorrah is on its loo it's on the on the lease it is going there but i want you to know that there is a people outside of sodom they are not lot who is worried about politics they're not lot who's worried about keeping the mayor position and sitting at the gate of the city they are the seed of abraham and they have had the mystery revealed to them and they see there's an old time god a god who is a present god a god who has not forgot his promise of god that something is happening and i've got some news for you some grand news this morning that sarah is expecting hallelujah that sarah is pregnant with child that sarah that bride is bringing for christ again in this last day i got some news let it be heard everywhere that there is a bride that is pregnant bringing forth christ the same yesterday today and forever [Music] revelation 5 shows the book of man's lost estate and the right hand of god upon the throne and a lamb representing our kinsmen goes and takes the book he had been slain at calvary but here is the transfer of title of the lost estate back into the hands of man it leaves from being held in the right hand of god representing the power of god that no one who was unworthy could take uh had to take the the legal transferring of the lost estate back in the hands of a man it had to take someone worthy it called for a worthy man that worthy man was the same lamb of calvary he was now advancing in his redeeming work he is now taking the book of the lost inheritance and bringing back the lost estate to man again and it does not remain in heaven in the hands of the of the lamb but it transfers into into by the spirit into the mighty angel only christ it could be in an anointing that comes down that puts his foot upon the land and the sea and the book is open and when when the book is open to those on earth seven thunders uttered their voices and when it when he utters it points to the indians is the breaking of the silence that has been held up for thousands of years that now become known to an end-time people are you with me i want you to know friends god's silence has been broken people listen to me right now people have been looking for him amen but the silence his silence that was dead in it it's a dead in silence missing him in methodist baptist presbyterian pentecostal message churches everywhere a silence god isn't there it's a business silence he's missing but i want you to know there's a people that the silence has been broken to because christ has come down with an open book and it's an unsealed book and now the mysteries are made known but it doesn't just to end there with the prophet and his message it continues on with the people digesting and eating that book and becoming one with that word and prophesying again and we are in the days where it's the days we are mandated to speak because it's only in the speaking that the arm of the lord is revealed when it was revealed in a prophet's ministry the arm of the lord would be laid bare to be revealed in the bride's ministry the arm of the lord is laid bare amen but what god doing to do that it takes an unleashing of faith connecting with the promise for you to start expecting to be the recipient of the lost estate that adam lost the the lost come on now the loss to dominion the loss of the rights of sons i want you to get it amen notice to be given his title is not enough amen it's not enough to even hand it to a prophet somebody help me preach amen the lamb must be taken that's why we've been preaching on the people the book because we are the people of the book is the one who owns the land we are the people of the promise we are the people of the lost estate are you with me by giving the book of testament to moses was not enough to reveal its mysteries and what god said and god said and god said and thou shalt and thou shalt not was not enough the land must be taken and joshua was commanded to take the land as i was with moses so will i be with you i will not fail thee i will not forsake thee amen this is where we have come to friend we are part of that joshua commission of people who are taking the land this is the land where milk and honey flows this is the land where divine healing is this is the land where joy unspeakable is this is the land where every gift of god is this is a land where every promise of the book is mine oh yes it's mine i'm not a slave and i can ditch my slave mentality i'm not of egypt the reproach of egypt
