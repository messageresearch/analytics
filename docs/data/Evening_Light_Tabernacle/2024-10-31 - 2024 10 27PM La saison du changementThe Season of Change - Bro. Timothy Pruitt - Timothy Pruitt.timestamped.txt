[36:12] appointed bounds of their
[36:19] habitation time to be born and a time

[37:01] plant amen a certain
[37:04] season C that are for
[37:09] har if we can go on down to the

[37:17] things but the point is everything has a
[37:20] time and a
[37:22] season and and in your life there a

[37:51] seasons amen we want things in our own
[37:54] time

[38:30] will in every individual's
[38:34] life in his own perfect
[38:38] time so we must give ourselves

[38:46] for
[38:47] our not what we
[38:50] desire
[38:51] to God wants us
[38:54] to amen there's four seasons in in the
[38:58] earth it's winter and spring and summer
[39:00] and
[39:04] fall every season has its
[39:07] purpose you know a winter season
[39:11] sometimes very loathsome or very
[39:15] boring gray and
[39:20] cloudy I know some of you love
[39:25] being I found out the French don't like
[39:27] being
[39:31] cold we're we're from the south of the
[39:34] United and it's very
[39:37] hot so we like our
[39:40] [Laughter]
[39:44] airon but I found some don't appreciate
[39:47] it as much
[39:50] I amen I said when you just stay a
[39:53] little
[39:55] bit you'll fall in love with air
[40:01] condition amen because we have Long
[40:06] Summers every one of them serves a
[40:09] purpose but you know in the gray winter
[40:14] time it's actually a time of in
[40:20] [Music]
[40:22] growth in trees and
[40:25] plants maybe you don't see nothing
[40:28] going seems like everything is dead but
[40:32] on the
[40:33] inside something is
[40:37] moving God is
[40:42] every good amen the spring
[40:46] time spring it's a time of
[40:50] transition it's a time of pruning
[40:53] off the soul rotates
[40:57] refreshing
[40:59] rain there a time of Joy
[41:03] glory after being dorant and
[41:07] through but it's a time when God shapes
[41:10] you
[41:12] and amen you know the summer is marked
[41:15] by this extreme
[41:19] heat there's need for more water
[41:23] than it's a time of needing more
[41:26] spiritual food
[41:29] true
[41:31] Christians season
[41:34] stronger amen Others May
[41:45] stumble
[41:47] deeper
[41:50] the God is using every season
[41:55] for because the fall is for Harvest
[42:00] Time expecting a
[42:03] harvest amen many times you know we love
[42:06] the as we say the mountain
[42:09] tops being up on the
[42:14] mountain amen sometimes we're down the
[42:18] valley
[42:20] hard
[42:21] trouble I'm here to tell you this
[42:24] evening is on the mountain
[42:29] God and he's working
[42:32] everything
[42:35] good so we must allow the season we're
[42:39] in to run his
[42:42] course God is a good god and let me let
[42:46] me just lay this in here for a moment
[42:49] it's always his
[42:51] intention it's always his
[42:54] desire to bless you
[42:57] despite the
[43:01] circumstances Hard
[43:02] Times uses them for his
[43:05] good perform his will in your
[43:09] life amen we can't change the season
[43:12] we're
[43:14] in but just as the day
[43:20] balances the that you walk through by
[43:26] God keep you
[43:29] balanced amen Paul had understanding of
[43:32] this he said I've learned that one state
[43:35] that I
[43:38] am where there with to be
[43:42] content I know to have I know what it's
[43:44] like to have
[43:46] nothing and I know what it's like to
[43:50] have but everywhere in all
[43:53] things I'm
[43:55] instructed that both to be full and to
[43:58] be
[44:00] hungry and whether I'm abounding or I'm
[44:02] having a
[44:05] need I can do all
[44:07] things Christ
[44:11] me amen so it determines what your
[44:13] source of
[44:16] power it's not Christ your seasons of
[44:20] your life will
[44:24] become they're far too heavy
[44:27] but if you can just hand them over to
[44:30] the learn to trust in his
[44:32] promise
[44:39] Le would say it like this hum yourself
[44:44] under the mighty hand of God might ex
[44:48] you in
[44:50] time so at the right time God will bring
[44:54] you
[44:55] out but no matter where you
[44:58] at for your
[45:01] good that's what the Bible says all
[45:04] things work together good to them that
[45:09] [Music]
[45:12] are hallelujah hallelujah amen so in
[45:15] other
[45:16] words in the right
[45:19] time the season will
[45:23] change it's easy to get discouraged when
[45:26] you're facing a difficult season of
[45:31] Life how quickly we begin to think man
[45:34] this this is going to last
[45:38] forever stuck
[45:40] here but if you if we believe we're in
[45:43] the hands of the who decre this
[45:48] seon then whatever season you're
[45:54] in amen see sometimes God doesn't try
[45:58] change your
[45:59] season he's trying to change your
[46:03] heart amen remember there's different
[46:06] seasons in our
[46:08] lives and we must let God do what he
[46:12] want every season
[46:15] of God is Sovereign he does what he
[46:19] pleases there isn't anything that
[46:22] happens to
[46:23] you I'm going to say that again there
[46:26] isn't
[46:27] anything that happens to you that
[46:30] catches God by
[46:34] surprise hallelujah hallelujah that
[46:37] should give us a lot of
[46:39] comfort God knew where I would be
[46:49] today still in
[46:53] control he's not only fully aware of the
[46:56] season of your
[46:59] but he has
[47:01] allowed for his
[47:04] glory see the psalm says it like this he
[47:08] does whatever pleases him in all the
[47:11] Heaven and the
[47:13] earth Isaiah would say it like this
[47:16] declaring the end from the
[47:19] beginning and from the ancient time
[47:22] things which have not been
[47:24] done say he says my purpose will be
[47:28] established and I will accomplish all my
[47:31] good
[47:33] pleasure so God Is With Us in every
[47:36] season of
[47:38] our and I want to get you this
[47:41] one God loves
[47:44] you if you're in a hard spot it's not
[47:48] because he
[47:51] doesn't if God loves you in the
[47:54] beginning love you at the end he do not
[47:57] change
[48:00] his he's not like a man who can love you
[48:03] one
[48:06] day God
[48:11] CH if God
[48:13] chose I he did
[48:26] [Applause]
[48:28] God loves
[48:29] you he will walk through you through
[48:31] every
[48:35] Darkness Rejoice with you
[48:40] time God will not send you on a hard
[48:44] path without him he is there with you he
[48:49] is helping you and as we heard the song
[48:53] even when you don't see him
[48:57] working even when you don't see
[49:04] nothing to his
[49:08] will so time is in God's
[49:12] hands for too many times we get
[49:16] frustrated with God because things are
[49:18] not happening on
[49:22] our you know we as
[49:25] humans intellect
[49:27] we got it all figured
[49:31] out we got we we know more
[49:37] somehow than the one who created
[49:40] us how is that
[49:44] possible hallelujah hallelujah somehow
[49:47] we get this
[49:50] idea than the one who
[49:53] created no no we are we in his
[49:59] timeline we think we know better
[50:04] so of course impatience you know
[50:10] depr but God is in so perfectly in
[50:16] control what you say brother Timothy
[50:18] about
[50:27] I mean I don't know what you're
[50:32] expect come on he's not back sitting off

[50:48] it see if you can make it
[50:51] no

[50:58] working it according to his
[51:02] will the
[51:05] Rapture happen in

[52:18] do why 2K
[52:28] God's looking around
[52:29] like you know why God didn't
[52:32] come because there was more names on

[55:17] Galatians 6 says let us not be weary and
[55:22] well for at the proper time we will reap
[55:25] a harvest
[55:27] if we don't give
[55:29] up hallelujah hallelujah but we go
[55:32] through seasons of
[55:35] Wai many times we find ourselves in a
[55:38] Seas of waiting
[55:40] and waiting for the Lord
[55:43] to
[55:48] C but in those
[55:51] Seasons God is
[55:53] there he's using those times
[55:57] as effectively as he uses a good
[56:00] time amen the time of waiting is not
