manifested himself Among Us he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll come all the way from Glory this morning by the power of His Holy Spirit and come come right to your Pew to where right where you are to whatever need you have in your life he's a God that cares about you he would care so much about you make known that he cared he'd sent a prophet in this day and discernment would come

the Yoke it breaks the Y mil of unbelief and doubt and fear and confusion it opens up our eyes of understanding so we can see the the hope of our calling in this day I pray Lord that you'll reveal yourself through your word Lord today and manifest your glory in your people bring Deliverance to your children there are those that are sick and in bondage Lord in imprisoned held hostage to some disease or affliction I pray God that you'll be merciful May our Kinsman Our Redeemer the one who cares about our need and provides for our healing may you also be our Avenger today and avenges of our adversary Lord I pray God for those that are bound up with spirits of unbelief and doubt and fear and confusion and Lord oh god there may be depression or can something that is in their lives Lord that's holding them back I pray today would today would be the day you stretched out your Mighty arm of Deliverance and somebody in this audience would reach out their hand to take a hold of it I ask that you would anoint now the word as we read it and we experience it today may you make the word real to us we pray in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord today and we're so thankful to be serving him together and happy that you are here and we welcome you today in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus we're going to be speaking on today on the The Living bride the voice of the resurrection and um we're just going to go through some scriptures some different quotations today I'm going to do something a little different than normal because I'm going to appeal to the authority of a prophet of the prophet of God for this age which we believe of course to be brother brandham seventh Church age messenger and we're here in the last day at in the Le leodan Church age and um we realize that we have a message in this day and that message is to prepare us for the very coming of the Lord Jesus to make a bride ready amen prepared to meet the bridegroom that's what we want to do so as we look into the word today we're going to be speaking of course on our our theme on the mountain movers as we have been through Zachariah using this as our as our overall theme as we go forward it says who art thou oh great Mountain Thou shalt become a plane and The Headstone shall be brought forth with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it and we know there is um headstone of course are the capping off of mystery truths that had to be revealed in this last day we find that in the Book of Revelation a book that was reserved for the end time people and then then of course we know there's a capping off of the in of the of the individual you with your own personal experience with God where you're filled with the Holy Ghost sealed till the day of redemption uniting you and God together and and he is the Capstone of every every life and so again we we look of course and we're looking at the the real Capstone coming which is the coming of our Lord Jesus where he will come in a Corporal body in a physical form we will meet him in the air that's what Believers believe amen and so we we know that will cap it all but to match that must be a bride who hath made herself ready and we have to be a people that meet the coming bridegroom so so as we look into the scripture we're going to look into Revelation chap 10 and we're going to read from the 10th verse we have been going over this scripture and there's many many um things that we could bring out of the symbology of this chapter it is something that is revent to our day to our time and and and of course um we uh we know that in Revelation 10:1 a mighty anointing comes down which is Christ it's not the physical or Corporal coming but it is the coming of Christ in in the word form as it comes now and it and it speaks out with crying he cries with a loud voice s this answers back to 1 Thessalonians 4 he shouts as U the bridegroom descends so he sends a message to turn our hearts back to the original Faith again the very gospel that Paul preached not a new gospel but the same gospel and so then it concludes in the chapter of where that John now John is symbolizing the entire bride and so one person is being used in the vision in this book of symbols to symbolize the entire body of Christ and John is told to take the book from the hand of the Angel the book is now open it was once sealed but now it is open and here in the this verse we will see that John representing us took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people's Nations tongues and people therefore the bride must be the voice of God in the last day so then we go to the the next scripture we want to refer to is 1 Thessalonians 4:15 as far this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first now stop a minute this is not a moment in a twinkling the ey event this is a process of the end time where the Lord himself just like in the days of Moses the Lord himself came down in a pillar of fire to a prophet and he brought him a message that sent him to deliver the people out of Egypt for The Exodus we are in another Exodus so we are seeing that's that in the Bible this story in the Bible is more than a story but it's a prophecy of the last day so here the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God three things he does as he descends and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord God bless you can be seeded now the final prophecy will be the bride's voice but do you know she will be the voice of the Archangel for the Archangel is Christ and that voice of God will be in her because she is his bride she is his representation on the earth now God's church has always spoke for God they've always been his voice on Earth he lives and he speaks today through his bride on the earth and I want you to realize that even you as an individual you are the voice of God in your generation we is the church Body of Christ the bride is the voice of God God would use a prophet to speak his voice through um he would use the the voice of a man this is the way that God has always done it down to the ages so if we would look here we're going to just refer to now some quotations from the from Brother Bram where he says the voice of the throne notice in the throne Before the Throne was seven stars the voice of the Stars voices now you see there's more in Revelation 4:5 we find out and the out of the throne proceeded lightning and Thunders and voices not one voice but voices understand voices plural what it was it God speaking to his church reflecting himself through the seven spirits when the true anointed of God speaks it is the voice of God and and to reject it is to remove the Candlestick or in other words the light will leave you if you reject the voice of God and see the voices the voices of the seven Church ages over here in the corner there the voices speaking with thunder and lightning now notice it's the voice of God and the voice of God we know can be heard in many many different ways the voice of God can be heard today in dreams it can be heard in Visions it can be heard in nature you can actually be out in nature and hear the voice of God inspiration of the Spirit come to you and through the preaching of the word and through the testimony of the Saints the voice of God can be heard now God could have chose the stars or the moon to to the wind or nature to preach the gospel but God chose men to preach the gospel and that's as brother bradam told us that's where the voice of God will come from so God's voice will come through men not just preachers but men men who do and men and women who preach the gospel by the the the life that they live so now as you're seeing this um he says nowadays they there're so well we don't believe in saying Hell in the Pulpit oh mercy we need men of God men who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach the people of seron if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived it is the voice of God that'll bring a reproach to them who reject it they say no one can put a finger on their on his or her life their sweet living if there was ever a man of God if that man or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you get all mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll get people tangled up and you won't know well you'll ruin them and ruin yourself just live your sermon so every one of us are called to preach a sermon amen and some of it is in the life we live when our sisters go out on the uh on on the town and they go into uh the the stores they are they're a testimony of what a Holiness should look like how a holy God is change the life when you see men who have quit their smoking they're drinking they're lying they're cussing they are a testimony to this world they are a sermon that is preached and you don't even have to use words to do it your very life will exemplify Christ amen so it will be a voice of God now notice the preacher is called to preaches and to live it too if you if you can't he said if you can't live live it then you should stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons all right here was voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of live voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness and Purity and undefiled lives walking around in the world Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweetest can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil said you know he says just like well he said if you could just preach like a Billy Graham or an or Roberts or somebody a great influential speaker he'd be oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention to that than nothing you get all the theology you wanted to and all the Seminary training and the devil just sits back and laugh at it but when he sees that life amen so you see when he sees that life that's what we want to see is is that life that is within us he says you know like and and so he goes go on and talks about this and he says you know look like look at them Devils down there you know the maniac and so on and and whatever you know when they came to him and and forced and and and and came against him with the disciples they couldn't cast him out but when they met that life when they saw him see him come quietly uhhuh he didn't have to say nothing the devil was already scared right then amen he know he had to leave because there come a life not only a sermon but a life and it said come out of him oh my that done it quite he knew what he was talking about he knew what he was doing you see that's what God wants to see today is a life and that's the only thing that devil will recognize you can use any kind of words you want to and fancy prayers and commands and everything but he I cannot stand against that life that's right we want our life sermon to be what preaches out of our Lives sir whether we ever stand before behind the pull pit we are preachers of the Gospel amen we must testify of Jesus Christ now as we look at Revelation 17 I want to just prefos this by saying sadly not only not not all that call themselves Christians speak for God Amen some are speaking for the church some are speaking far some theological idea amen but not all are speaking for God so look here for a moment because remember the church that Paul hoped to present as a Chase virgin is seen over here in the Book of Revelation a as a lewd woman with daughters now we're going to look at this together and and verse one says and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talk with me saying unto me come hither I will show Thee the Judgment of the great horde that sth upon many Waters so now he sees this now why a how can a church be a how can that happen by receiving seed are the words of a man instead of the seed word of Christ who is her husband amen you see the word is to have pre preeminence in God's people amen so again when when a woman takes in the seed of another man she prod she commits the act of adultery or harlotry this is exactly why God will call the church a the one that Paul said I fear by by any means like the serpent begal Eve through his subtlety so should your be Minds be corrupted Ed from the Simplicity that is in Christ he said I wanted to present you as a Chase virgin but I this is my fear the Serpent's going to get in there and he's going to begal you as he begal e now look the verse the the next verse says with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication that's adulteries or pernah and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit on a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy and having seven heads and 10 horns now the Bible will tell you she sits on a city of seven heels and so on but look I want to point R on this why names a blasphemy why names a blasphemy do you know it is Blasphemous for the church to be called called by any other name than his name amen when the church takes on names of Baptist Methodist Catholic she has taken on her own name which is blasphemy before God the bride is to take on his name amen now so as you look at this in verse four and the church the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold in precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her handful of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead a name written now what I want you to see this she didn't write her name here the same one that Mark Cain in the beginning is the same one that writes on This Woman's forehead and says here is her true identity she is Mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and the Abominations of the earth now God marks her as a prostitute now watch and he said I saw this woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered I I marveled at her you know you you can look at this great church and how could she be this how could the church turn into such a thing but this is what we have had and in this in in seven Gentile Church ages we wind up with the Book of Revelation being about two women one a wh and her daughters and the other The Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ so you see it all comes up in a climax here God has a bride the devil has a bride so how in the world could this LW woman be God's voice a wife is to represent her husband the two are one she is to act and to speak in his name amen but this is her condition she's not only polluted her womb but she's guilty of murdering his children she has daughters that try to identify with him too and and God calls him harlots for they too have rejected his lordship and they are no longer virgins listen when Christ comes back he's going to have a virgin to the word she will know no man-made Creeds so the Bible tells you here that she was this woman was arrayed with in purple and scar dealt with with go decked with gold and precious stones and pearls and had a golden cup in her in her hand this full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication so who is this woman and where do we find her also in the in the Book of Revelation we find her in the Book of Revelation over in Revelation 3:17 because you see this is written of the false Vine in leoa she claimed seems to be a rich church because thou sayest I am rich I'm increased with goods and I have need of nothing you see that's her assessment of herself amen but here's God's assessment here's the way God assesses the church watch and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked so I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint th eyes with eyes that they may see you see Le oia is prophesied to be blind the last age goes into total blindness now I want you to look at the verses before he said of her I know your Works Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would you were cold or hot so then because you are lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth now as we look at this we want to understand she is no longer his voice he has sped her out of his mouth she is no longer speaking for him oh she speaks of herself come on what God said of her and what she says of herself is two different things she's saying I'm rich I'm increased with Goods you know I sit like a queen I'll know no sorrow as it says in Revelation 18 all of these things that she is saying about herself and God's got a different assessment of her so she and God are not saying the same thing notice so he says I'll spew you out of my mouth so now as we examine that that in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people listen even how to be baptized immersion simple thing is immersion was lost replaced for sprinkling the the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was lost and here we have we have down Through the Ages a trinitarian concept the idea and the understanding of that God is one not three comes lost in the ages a lot of confusion and he said God sent Luther with the word notice and he says the Lutheran spoke for God at that time so there was a time God actually spoke through them but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends toward Dogman and Creeds not simple word and they could no longer speak for God and then God sent Wes and he was the voice with the word in his day and the people who took his Revelation from God became living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation and when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age so now we we notice here there is now another people God calling a people out in this day to himself and and so he goes on to talk about how the church is no longer his mouthpiece of the mouthpiece of God so God is turning on her and he will confound her through the prophet in The Bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation 17 the spirit and the or verse 17 says the spirit and the bride say come notice here you have a woman who is saying the same thing the spirit says come on Amen we have Leia who said God saying one thing she says another amen you have in the last chapter of Revelation in verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come so the spirit and the bride are speaking in unison she is saying what the spirit says once more the word the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age so don't be surprised at the rejection because the word of God is totally set aside now so God has a voice and his voice today is in a word bride she is the anointed one of this day this is what brother Brandon brought to us in Christ the mystery he said and there would come a time forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have preeminence in this church oh my what the anointed man but now the anointed people Al Mighty bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom now you see there's a bride that's anointed like he is amen now not only is she his voice but she is the resurrection amen now this was spoke of the groom when he said to Martha said your brother will will rise again and she said well yeah I know he'll rise again in the resurrection and whatever but Jesus assured said I am the resurrection amen I am the resurrection and though though Lazarus was dead yet he would live amen now that same word that speaks of the groom when Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life it must be what we can say of a end time people a people who are the resurrection who are the life of God come on they are they are the embodiment of the spirit of God so so again the the same word that speaks of the groom it also speaks of the Bride so you see again this is a very important to understand what whatever you see a m Mr Jesus you got to understand is to be manifested in Miser Jesus now so go back and look at the prophecies go back and look at the new test as a prophecy and understand the same word that spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride now Jesus proved he was a resurrection how did he do that because he rose from the dead and he did it by the spirit of God that was in him now Jesus came to bring dead men to Life by making a way to put his Spirit within us that we who were dead could also live amen now so the Bible said if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead shall dwell in you amen he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also make aive Quicken life your mortal bodies by that spirit that dwelleth in you that's what the Holy Spirit does in your life it makes your mortal body alive to God Amen now our first birth births us into sin so we were born dead to God and the and to the spirit realm totally blocked off from it and we were blocked from its Supernatural power but we were born very much alive to these five senses and alive to sin and to his desires and to his vices the Bible tells you in Ephesians that when even we when were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus notice this number one we were dead we were born dead being born into by this first life by his first nature we were born dead to God and to the supernatural realm to the spirit amen we were born in sin and we were we were dead in sin but when a Believer becomes a person becomes a believer in Christ and are filled with the Holy Spirit we we know that first they are considered spiritually dead but now they are made spiritually alive and they are dead to sin and they're dead to their old life as if they were crucified alongside of Christ and they're now alive with a new life in him essentially signifying a complete transformation of freedom from the power of sin through their Union with Christ death and his resurrection you see when you are born again that is resurrected life in you and you can say I am the resurrection yes I was dead in sins and trespasses but now I am alive forever more amen I'll never go back to sin again because once you're sealed to the day of redemption friend you don't go back no turning back so Romans would say this as Paul would say what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that we can have more grace or the grace shall abound but God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein you see you can't do it so when a Believer receives Christ and filled with the spirit they are they are risen with Christ you have resurrected I mean why do you think that we baptize you unto the dead as the Bible said baptize us unto the dead well the Mormons go over there and they baptize a bunch of baptize person many times for dead people that's not what he's talking about you were baptized unto unto dead because your old life is dead and the old man is dead and we're burying that one in a watery grave and but we're not leaving him there we are resurrecting him up to walk in the newness of life so your very baptism is symbolic of your death burial and Resurrection so you see you see as he says in Colossians if you then be risen with Christ seek those things that are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things of the Earth for you are dead and your life is hid in Christ with Christ in God so we have been raised up to sit together in Heavenly places Romans 6 says knowing this that our old man is crucified now we get it crucified you have been crucified we have killed the old man you know that really that's what the altar is for why was an altar in the Old Testament it was a place where the lamb was slain and amen placed on the altar amen so the sacrifice was slain you come to God as a sacrifice yield yourself given your body to be filled with the Holy Ghost and it's got to die on The Altar but don't stay at the altar you got to rise again you got to rise to walk in the newness of life amen so our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin brother that's the greatest news you can have today amen you're no longer a slave to sin amen you're a child of the Living God you are dead to sin and it's so life and you are alive in Christ Jesus this God that can open a blinded eyes and can clean a dirty heart or a God that can raise the dead physically can certainly raise him spiritually amen he can Quicken the Mortal body and can certainly quick can the immortal Soul Amen to make it alive so it makes you alive to Christ and dead to your past life and brother Bram says it this way the old things what does it do to our mortal body it turns our opinion it changes our Notions it sets our affections on things which are above and the smoking and the drinking and gambling and the things you used to do is dead it's beneath you you see you can't be a sinner Saint you're either a sinner or a saint you can't be a black white bird you're either black or white amen but listen when you when your old man is dead amen you're dead to that life it no longer has preeminence or control over you you have a rule over it the life you now live in the flesh you live by the faith of the son of God who loved you and gave his life for you that's amen so therefore you are quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already notice the Pentecostal people of there when they got quickened by the Holy Spirit listen to me when those Pentecostal group these those Pentecostal group up there on the day of Pentecost received their abstract Deed from God sure it glorified their souls they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them and it so quickened their body till they could even speak in an Earthly language anymore it quickened their body to a Heavenly language the place that they're going to amen quickening power of God shook their mortal bodies until their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language oh what a quickening power what something that belongs oh if that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal body it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies we are quickened in by the power of the Living God tongues quickened to a new Heavenly language to speak to them and a rapturing up raising up into a different atmosphere than they ever had lived in also with a new quickening life to them that that come in them it quickened their language they spoke in new tongues amen my what what great things that we're looking at that looking at so what does it do that it listen it so that you'll know and this Easter I want it to mean more to you than any Easter did I want you to see it we know what it done for them but I want you to see not will it has done the same for you amen he rose and could say I am the resurrection you have risen from sin and trespasses so therefore you are the resurrection and you are to give voice to that resurrection that Resurrection Life it comes it lives out of you notice quickens a mortal body this Mortal body that we live and it quickens it in other words brings to life and amen now you who once walked along with a big great big cigar in your mouth and everything bunch of cigarettes you women who once had short hair painted and carried on wore shorts and things like that all at once something screamed you you look down here and it was the word and it quickened your you said no more shorts for me no more for me no more lying no more stealing no more this or that the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal body the dust of the earth into subjection you see what is it subjection to what Christ and who is Christ the word not the theology but the word then you say what these things oh I think it's all right for women to wear slacks the word said no see it quickens you to that you're drawn to it and you see then you become part of that word now so even so the bride is being filled with the spirit she has been made alive she is the living bride there has to be a people alive and remain at the come of the Lord and I mean more than physically alive but spiritually alive and how could you be spiritually alive without the entire deity the power of the Holy Spirit coming in you and quickening you to life again so you see she's a living bride and she gives voice to the resurrection so you see we were in tuned also as a church now let's move it away from the individual to the body of the church and and so so we we were inomed in nomination ations sealed with Creeds now remember on Jesus tomb they put Roman seals on our tombs on the church's tomb we got sealed behind Roman seals Creeds of man Trinity doctrines Triune Gods all kinds of you know novenas and and all kinds of edicts and pople papa bulls and everything else seal behind kept dead in tombs remember they sealed Jesus in to make sure he stay dead and the devil did the same thing with the church and she went down at night see a Rome he sealed her there in tombs of religion and put seals on her to make sure she stayed dead are you with me and then now so here brother bradam says and today they're trying to keep Christ in a tomb but oh what a Easter morning done an Easter morning ruined all their Theology and when a Easter morning came for a people a church here 1900 years later it ruined their theology he's not dead he's alive forever more and they can't keep him in no tomb amen you can't you can put him in a Methodist tomb or a Baptist tomb or a presbyterian tomb or whatever you want to he raised up out of that tomb and he's alive today I had a Baptist tomb you might had a Methodist tomb but one day Jesus rose up from there from a historic God to a living present God alive forever more Hallelujah that ought to make us shout to realize we have been released from the tomb broke the seals of the Doom the church that was born alive Al on the day of Pentecost during the Dark Ages was killed on a Roman Tree life forced out of her she lay lifeless dead void of the Holy Spirit say in their hell mares pray in their rosaries dead powerless Ed in tombs of religion until we have graveyards full of tombstones and tombs come on and man graveyards full of churches with all kinds of names on the tombstone of Catholic Baptist Methodist Pentecostal all kinds of organization somebody with me because every time they organized they died every time they sat there and they and they put a period to what they believe instead of moving on with God there they died God left them in the dust but God said I will have a church I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle I will restore sayeth the Lord how many believes in restoration this morning he's a God that restore we heard the voice of God that said come out of her my people amen come on this time he wasn't saying Lazarus he was saying my people and he said come out of her my people come out of those morgs where the atmosphere is 40 bil deg degrees below zero and cold and dead and indifference you me to show you here's where he said it Revelation 181 after these things I saw another angel now remember an angel is a messenger remember is an anointing coming down it comes down from heaven we having great power and Earth was lightened with his glory understand this wasn't done in a corner amen this was the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried and I want you to understand this word cried is exactly Revelation then cried and say exactly first Thessalonians four shout he cried mightily with a strong voice saying proclaiming Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful word that is the condition of organized religion amen All Nations have drunk of the wine of her the wrath of her fornication the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are wax Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies my think about this contaminated the whole world and I heard another voice from heaven now here's Heaven's Echo to what this angel said saying come come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues now wait a minute her plagues are coming in the tribulation ahead and the Rapture takes place before that so in order for there to be a Rapture there has to be a resurrection out of denominationalism the voice of God saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sin and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins like Sodom have reached to heaven and God has remembered her iniquities reward her even as she has rewarded you and double and double there what according to her works and in the in the cup which she has f f to her double how much she glorified herself and lived deliciously and so much torment and sorrow give her for she said in her heart I sit as a queen I am no Widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire same thing God did with prostitutes in the Old Testament for strong is the Lord who God who judges her amen oh my you remember Ezekiel 38 remember the dry bones where he said come alive how did they live how did they live the word of God through a prophet brought them life amen this is the way that happened prophesy son of man and it is the son of man prophesying are you with me Christ is the son of man prophesying through a son of man a prophet amen through sons of men and those sons of men are New Testament prophets and preachers the bride and his calling come out of the tombs I'm looking to a people today who heard that voice come out come on maybe some of you don't have all of the the the the death Rags that's been red around you and you got all wrapped up and Tangled Up and Theology and ideas and everything maybe some of that hadn't been yet been loose but you've risen out of there amen I tell you the word goes for Lazarus loose him and let him go that's the word today amen loose them from the bondages of Sin from the bondages of sickness from the darkness of this world loose them let him go amen there's all sorts of tombs let me just say that there's all sorts of tombs there's tombs of religion there's tombs of sin there's tombs of depression there's tombs of complexes there's tombs of sickness there's tombs of habits but the voice of God has been released and there is a bride that is speaking at that said loose them let them go come out of her I'm telling you today you don't have to keep living in bondage young people don't have to be slaves to pornography sex sins and fornication has no has no right to rule over children of God you do not have to remain in some tomb and dead in sins and trespasses when the voice of God is going forth saying loose them let them go before his resurrection Jesus spoke with resurrection power and before the resurrection of the Bride where she physically will raise from The Seven Ages there will be there's a people on the Earth who would speak with resurrection power giv life that's what we're doing we're speaking over you we're calling come out Rise Up from that dead put away those stiny Works those dirty habits that sinful life you don't have to live that any longer you can be free to serve the Living God come out of the tombs Hallelujah you see Jesus became the voice he became the manifestation of the scripture the voice of the scripture and so must the bride the voice of the word will be spoken through her not only is she a word bride she don't just have it to be a word bride she does it to speak Amen to say or Mountain to be a Mountain Mover a devil defeater a serpent Bruiser I'm talking to you this morning amen I'm talking to you if youve Reed life you ought to rejoice in it and say here I am I have received that life and I am that Resurrection it lives in me amen now so as we look at this Jesus became the voice and so will the bride be the voice of The Words which will be spoken through her now this is a new age now not meaning a new church age because there's only seven of them but it is a bride age the where the groom is united in marriage to the bride you see she has his name his identification his life his power she is him so the two have become one now this is what brother bradam tells us in it is the rising of the sun he said as Christ was the first one from all the prophets and so forth although typed to many places he was the first fruits of those that slept now stop for a minute we have been through seven ages and they have been sleeping for Seven Ages there has to be a first fruit of those who slept a people who come back to the original Power the original life who have resurrection power and life in them come on Amen who have broke the seals of the Tomb the seals are open the Mysteries revealed are you are you with me now now watch these words in the bride coming of Christ notice this because before he can come in the meeting in the air and how many want to see Jesus that's a longing of a heart but before he can come he has to make himself manifest fully in his church so before he comes again as groom he's got to manifest himself in entirely in completion in his bride so D if I could say it to you there had to be the word coming of Christ but now we are in the bride coming of Christ so Christ is come no not the man Jesus we will meet him in the air but Christ is the Holy Spirit and he is here it's the spirit of Christ it's not another spirit it's not one of the Trinity it is God himself and he's come and has manifest himself to a bride body and that bride is his body on Earth his voice on Earth in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheath waved again another words another one come to maturity that God picks up and says okay here's the first fruits here she is the first one come to maturity so that the rest of them can come up you see when Jesus rose he was the first fruits of those that slept and you are the first fruits of those who slept AB right now so there had to be a sheath waved again in the last days remember waving of the sheath we've been through it many times what was the sheath the first one that come to mature so the first bunch of grain that came to maturity the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was a sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and for the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection what out of where dark denominationalism Hallelujah will come an Easter message Hallelujah that the full majority of the word is turned back and is again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there oh Hallelujah this is what is promised that is our message Church the word is turned back and is again it's here in full power and it's being waved over us every time you feel the Holy Spirit move over your being every time you feel the Holy Spirit sweep through this church it is his holy spirit waving over you picking you up and showing you things and revealing himself and manifesting His glory in your life life saying you are not in the Tomb anymore no wonder we can dance in the spirit no wonder we can shout up and down the aisles no wonder we can glorify God somebody help me preach amen no wonder we can see signs and wonders and miracles and healings and deliverance come on Amen don't expect to to be less and less expect it to be more and more Hallelujah because he is waving I just he's waving it now watch holding up for all to see thanking God for the Harvest God's picking up a people in this day and he's thaning he he is he is being thanked for a harvest amen that Harvest is going to include all of the Bride to The Seven Ages we are about to see a resurrection hallelujah amen already the voice of it is here amen now I just want to just say this as we look at it we know the third pull was the opening of the seven of the Seven Seals are revealing of the Mysteries and when we say third puls brother Brandon referred that it come from a vision it was symbolic we you don't have time to go into all the symbology of that in the vision there's a there's a lot of details in it but it was the third pull which he called third phase of his ministry you know it started out with a sign in his hand whereby he would take a person by hand and the disease would act out on his hand as even as Moses was given two signs so was he given two signs because we were in an exodus and so again with this sign in his hand it would it would actually you know tell diseases and if it was a germ disease it would reveal the diseases what it was and so on and then after prayer it would show if it was still there we knew the life was still there if it was gone life was gone then the second part of it that was healing the second part was prophesying that was the stage that I witnessed brother Brandon M he had you know he would discern the thoughts and intense of the heart and without fail never one time up on thousands of thousands of cases are you with me amen and prophesy over an individual your name is so and so you came from so and so you're you're so and so you're going to be well or sometimes I see prepare for death because you don't have many days to live because he saw it turn dark over them and the faith not to turn it so you see the third pull was a third phase which he thought would manifest in another Divine Healing move maybe it would be under some kind of tent or Cathedral he couldn't describe exactly what it was under but it was all in symbology the whole thing and so as he as he looked at all of this he he was told you know about the third phase of his ministry and he wondered he pondered he tried this tried that to make it happen cuz he thought it would be another greater Divine Healing gift he's a man he had to probe at things just like you and I probe at things yes Ponder Wonder amen Venture without Authority presume all of those things and he would come down to the end of his ministry and look back and he said the third pull was the opening of The Seven seal now it was healing but it was healing on a different level it was to heal the bride elect of the false doctrines of the ages by opening the book where we could say with authority that's right cuz we've had all kinds of theologians so he said is he said May there come forth a Revival of the just how many's righteous this morning are you righteous to his blood amen so that may there be a Revival you can you can pray with the prophet a Revival for the righteous and a great power come upon the church just before it's going where are we at and it's not hard to pray that because you promised it and we're looking Lord for that third pole that we know that will do great things for us in our midst now the third pull that's opening the word but it's not just theology it's the opening of the word and his power you know it's like brother brandham told us said what we need today is an opening of the word that lives a lot of this which they call opening of the word is dead it's just more Creeds it binds the Holy Spirit it will not let him work but you see it's that third pull is and part of manifestation of that was word spoken by a child of God that said little fishy I give you life resurrection power amen if make a dead fish live what will it do for the dead Church come on what will it do for the dead in Christ I'm talking about the power that's in the word now amen certainly the third pull is the open in the word but it manifests itself in power and Christ is that Capstone that caps the Gentile bride with his coming when we meet him in the air but already even now I want to say this there is already a union that you can't see with your eyes amen it is an invisible Union and Christ has slipped on you the wedding band of un predestinated unmar Grace amen he slipped it on your finger before the foundation of the world but he showed you see I've all you've always been mine I have chose you Hallelujah you are mine little church you are mine and as a word bride in his very image she has to fit him remember the Capstone and the living bride must be exactly like in order to unite together for it to sit down on the body now Israel we know how to leave Egypt its Gods its priest in order to go to the promis land right we had to leave the her Harlot daughters her theologians her Sorcerers her Creeds her dogmas we had to leave the tombs of our bondage amen now this is what brother Bram said and the church has to do the same thing get out of that group of rejectors over into the promise before the Messiah can ever be manifested before them you see the life of the Messiah manifested making a church ready a bride a woman marry a man and disagreeing with him it would be some kind of fuss continually but when a man and his wife his girlfriend his asout when they are in Perfect Harmony like one soul and one mind because they're going to be one flesh then when the church can get in such harmony with God until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride because they're going to be one hallelujah amen so he cannot marry a woman disagreeing with him he she can't marry somebody and they're saying you God you're three and he said no I'm one no you're three no I'm one no you're three there there's three of I have three husbands Father Son and Holy Ghost and I ain't going to leave one of them out and I'll pray to each one equally I'm going to love one as much as I love the other and God says I'm one you see you you see again you cannot marry a bride and her in constant disagreement well Holiness without how do you can't see God well God I'm going to see you without it I'll wear make my makeup right into heaven no you won't you Harlot amen disobedient to the word rebellious it says a sin of Witchcraft as iniquity and idolatry amen so you know again you must get in Harmony in order to be United with him that's why people won't get the Holy Ghost they won't die to their own ideas and ways now if you review the sermons in the Holy Ghost series what the Holy Ghost was given for and and question answer the Holy Ghost and different ones he speaks of how when Luther came with justification how that God chipped a little bit of the spirit and poured it in the church in justification now it was the Holy Ghost but only a portion and he poured it in the church in justification and then in Wesley's day he poured out a little more of his spirit in sanctification and as the ages has progressed God has been filling his church as he said in the last days 2,000 years days plural I'll pour out my spirit on All Flesh amen so again as we as we look at this just for a moment them lutherans back there when they got saved they got a portion of the spirit Methodist Sanctified that was a work of the spirit it was a part of the Holy Spirit even the the gifts that was poured out it is ausa Street it was a portion of the spirit a greater portion you know don't don't discount that that was the Holy Ghost amen and then of course the Zeus of movement and and came to zeusa movement and and and you know at that time he said of this and I'm going to get to it here in a moment because often we dismiss them as false I want to say they weren't all false in fact there is much bride as your bride I'm talking about I'm talking about those filled with the spirit coming out of ausa street now as we come along they come less and less and less and less and more and more and more Creeds and dogmas of man but they were they're often dismissed as faults like I said they weren't all faults they were the Bride of their age they were you see the Shu or the chaff is a necessary part of the wheat plant they were the bride in their time there was as much wheat you know in in that sense as as as any of it they were the bride of Christ in their time they were the elect of God they were a true move of God and they were just green unripened because the light of the word had not ripened the wheat and there was another stage of growth beyond the chaff or the shuck now I I I'm just going to go over this for a moment and just let the haters hate but let me just say this you know this is where what brother Brandon spoke about he said they were in the minority to begin with OR to start with on the side of an alley out there with an old guitar and women couldn't even afford a par of stockings laying out on the railroad tracks picking up corn and mashing it and making bread for their children but what's it come to now watch now the most powerful standing Church in the world today this is what he said of them the zeza movement the most powerful standing Church in the world today not in the eyes of the world but in the eyes of God because he proves it by what he's doing for them he's pouring himself into them pouring it in that's what he said about them the listen again let me say to most powerful standing Church in the world today in the eyes of God that's what isus the street was that's what the movement was even in 1959 when he said these words this was his assessment I'm using the prophet's Authority now that's why I'm bringing this out that's I want you to see it all right so this was the isua Revival here was if you can look where the little arrow is pointed there's a little tiny head that's forming it's all green you see represented now listen Jesus said as a corn of wheat if it's it abides alone he said you know it will accomplish nothing he got to be buried and come back up and come to life he said the kingdom of heaven or the realm of the Holy Ghost would be like a man planting the seed and he said it would come until there would be the blade and the tossle and then the full ear when it comes to the full ear he will thrust in the sickle and he will take it home that's the Rapture all right so we have been through stages of restoration and these and really were more of a Reformation because as you see this is nothing like a mature grain it's green if you cut it at this stage all you have is hay or straw for f so the only way it can go in the Garner is to become into full grain and be ripened and it takes the sunlight to do that and the sunlight is the word of God this is why Revelation 10 shows his face as it were the sun because in the end time he is here in his full light to do what to bring it to complete maturity what will the same church that was on the day of Pentecost because unfortunately as close as it was ausa Street wasn't so now you have it you have just visible and this was ausa Street just poking up looks like we got a head we got grain we got grain look look see the grain see the it's not grain yet is still Shu the husk is being formed it's coming out but it's part of the head it's part of the end time move are you with me so and he he explained to the Lutheran College who asked him about the Holy Ghost experience ask him about their movement and ask him what what we have and he said well you know man planted a field of corn the first bleach come up and he said thank the Lord for corn crop of corn he said did he have it well no potentially but he had it only in the early form and by and by it become a stalk and a tossel which came out with Methodist and it moves on and then there's another stage which is called the husk which is the Shu or uh you know there's several different words for it there the the the um the Shu the husk or the chaff three different words that we use for this so now Luther was the blade and Wesley was the tossel but now watch he said it was the Lutheran Church that made the Wesley church it was the Wesley church that made Pentecost but Pentecost what is it now I want you to see this for a moment because he's looking at it he's looking at it and he sees it heading up and he says but Pentecost what is it it's a restoration of the same kind of grain that went in the ground at the beginning bringing back the fullness of the power of Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy Ghost see in the last days now that's what he thought it was now remember we could go through and it's a whole different sermons but in every age there are twins there's twins who ever Revival we could start in Heaven There was in heaven twins there was Michael and Lucifer Lucifer exalted himself with the word he was cast down amen he comes for back to down to earth looking for a way back into the Heavenly places and the only way he can get back is to take the the position of man and to get man to to do that he has to sin and he has to become the Lord of him this is why Satan will stand in the heavens and he will he will be at the right hand to oppose the saints of God that is why we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places Heavenly places this is why when job was there and of the sons of God appeared satans with him because again he is accuser of the Brethren he stands there to say you have no right to be there are you with me but now notice here there's those twins there in the heavens on the earth what did we have we had twins we had the serpent we had we had two trees let's look at them we had Tree of Life tree of death had a serpent right next to man and then man then we come right on there's a Jacob there's an Esau there's an ishmail there's an Isaac there's there there's all all of these all the way down to into Jesus there's a Jes Jus there's a Judas both of the same tribe and you come down the last day and there's Twins and the twins is a Shu husk that can be mistaken for the grain now you know I've been a farmer so now we're going to change varieties but you know I like what we call maze or sweet corn it's not wheat then look at all like this but there's been times where I planted corn and I got so anxious for corn for a ripen grain and I would see it out there man I had this beautiful husk I had call it shuck had the tassels hanging out of it it looks right and I'd pull it back only to find no grain it hadn't ripened you see it was so close it deceived me and at this point brother brandom's looking at this church and he says Ah it's look what he said it's bringing back the fullness of the power of Pentecost it's the restoration of the same kind of grain this is what he thought it was do you realize it is not until the seals are open that he begins to understand there's a shut a husk a a chath that he hadn't even considered do you know there was a prophet in the days of of called Isaac got deceived by his own son come on Amen prophets can can misunderstand they can they can look and they think this is what I think it is and it isn't watch now so he comes in the Rapture message and he says that corn of wheat fell in the ground and died under the Dark Age persecution it went the ground it had to die any man's spirit will going see that unless that seed dies and rot it abides alone and it had to go in the ground under the dark AGS and laid there rotted and it come forth two little blades of the Lutheran Church and now the Lutheran Church brought forth more blades and swingly and and from there come on up the tsel which was John West ly the great missionary age you see pollination age and it dropped back and and out of there come a deceiving age that Pentecostal age anybody El here ever raise any Wheat you look and you you look at that wheat and you when you look at it you go out there and say I got wheat and you look like you got wheat there open it up real close and watch you hadn't got any Wheat at all you got a shot didn't Jesus warn us that in Matthew 24:24 in the last day the two Spirits would be so close together it would deceive the elected it wheat itself it was possible see now watch it's a car but wait wait brother Tim you said they were bride and they were but when it comes to ripening time all of the wheat plant dies and there's no life in them and the only one goes in the Garner is the wheat the only one goes in the Rapture is the original Gra the all the rest of them are left behind for the tribulation so the Shu the chaff is a twin to the grain started out looking like a grain with signs and wonders and but it lacked the full word the word the grain will have the word and power you see this is a job of the Forerunner remember even as John the Baptist forun the first coming of Christ we had to have a forerunner to forerun the second coming of Christ that's why God sent an Elijah prophet in this day to forerun his coming to prepare the way for the come of the Lord if not we'd all be in the and Harlot system so there had to be a message saying come out now watch Matthew 3:11 he said John says I will baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand he will purly thoroughly Purge his floor he will gather his wheat into the Garner but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire who in the world was the chaff in that day it was Disciples of Moses it was scribes and Pharisees and the religious men of that day come on and they were left behind come on they were left behind and what happened to them they went through 2,000 years of tribulation until we've had the tribulations of those days shall never be the Bible said never again will a people be persecuted like that for so many years you see their tribulation period is not three and A2 years it it's 2,000 years where they've been aund persecuted group scattered everywhere all through Europe Asia everywhere across the globe America South America everywhere but the same God that said to us come out also said to them come out that's right and now they're back in their Homeland as a sign that we must be in our homeland the Bible somebody with me now following now let's just look at it here's your grain with the husk you see the very center there is a grain with no husk the other has the husk or the chaff and the and and John said he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire now I'm not saying all of them are going to be lost cu the tribulation will be where the church is purged through the tribulation but the bride escapes that and is raptured up because she is this grain but if you look there it insed or protected the grain it allowed the grain to be born out of that so being born out of the isusa movement would become a word bride now she will leave the sh why cuz it's dead so well everything's dead there no there's one thing there you can see that's not dead that's the Grain and the life is sealed into it you see R won't get it come on Amen it's listen Church once it's sealed in the devil is sealed out amen she is predestined this grain is predestined for a Rapture to go into the Garner the barn now but even as brother brandom says that he realizes we're going beyond that he said now in this age we're in now the living this age it's beyond Pentecost so he realizes that though he's seeing this he says now we're coming to an age because Pentecost has settled itself in organization and started faking a whole lot about organizations we are this and we are that and that's just nature you can't help it it's nature they'll do that it's a plan for them to do that but the church has moved on it's gone into greater and more powerful it's the restoration of gifts and many Pentecostal people don't believe in Divine Healing Ministry of angels and powers of God many Pentecost C these Visions I see the devil many organizations won't have nothing to do with it in Pentecost see we moved beyond that just as Methodist called Pentecostal crazy many Pentecostals let's see called for speaking in tongues just just as Lutheran called Methodist crazy for shouting but it's all coming forth of the Holy Spirit till the great church is being filled up and CH full Hallelujah of the great powers of almighty God until it's got to a place where the very works that Jesus done has manifest itself right in the church now we're close friends see where we're at you see this bride she is the resurrection and the life now I'm going to get a few more points before we close this morning because I'm not leaving without it you see the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that Sanctified the Methodist that baptized the Pentecostal is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it will be so powerful that body will come into this group of church that will draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection that's what the the Holy Ghost is far hallelujah what is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot be made perfect when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard against it and we're in a day now back there um there wasn't half as smart as today they couldn't make an atomic bomb or an automobile they didn't have science and things as we have now all things and mysterious things to try to say man blow together some by some dust and so forth and take some analysis and try to prove it to make infidels out of people but now when we need it the spirit of God raises a standard what is it he's poured in his spirit and those who are resting out y in the grave or under the alter of God as the scriptures said are crying how long Lord how long how much longer God is waiting on you and me and the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection then when the church in Christ comes so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we'll go in the Rapture hallelujah hallelujah amen what's now I'm going to bring out just a few more of these where she becomes the voice of the Resurrection notice so the Holy Spirit has been moving there was just a little breath of it with Luther a little BL blow of it with Wesley a little deeper blow of it with Pentecost now the breath and the spirit has become the same and she's uniting together bringing forth that same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost that he did back there is manifesting the same works that he did back there is being manifested right today the same thing amen watch Jesus said verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing except he sees the father doing it first what the father does he shows the son the father dwelleth in me he doeth The Works amen again in Elijah in the meal offering brother Bram says this that that during the day of Luther we live by justification during the days of Wesley we live by sanctification the church come in the minority in the days of Pentecost we live down through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts now we're really in the minority the coming of the Son of God and here they believe by faith here they shouted under sanctification here they spoke in tongues as a gift but now the negative and the positive and the cap is coming on the pyramid and it's the end time when the Christ in his church will be so much alike till he's going to call the Dead from the Methodist Lutheran and all those back there and there will be a resurrection then that fell asleep in the first second third fourth sixth fifth six six seventh watch we'll rise one of these days to meet Jesus in the skies the hour has arrived friends the coming of the Lord is at hand hallelujah what a day we're living in church what an hour we're living in a bride who is his Voice Hallelujah confirmation of the Resurrection he says this and Jesus is so close to coming to Earth until now until his power has began to catch the people and winding them up and getting them ready for the bride getting them ready to be caught up in the Rapture a church that are just fit just exactly to be taken up through its power listen through its power will draw all the rest of them that's born again out of the earth Jesus is coming Hallelujah as my hand against the wall would make a Shadow and the shadow is deeper deeper and deeper and closer as my hand gets and after a while the shadow of my hand becomes one and the church started in Martin Luther's time under justification on the wesle through sanctification and now in the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the Pentecostals and the restoration of G and out of that Pentecostal people he's pulling a that Remnant up here to show Jesus Christ reflect his life just the same yesterday today and forever exactly when the evening lights shine Hallelujah I'm talking to people about ready to change Dimensions hallelujah amen about ready to meet your theophany about ready for that body there to come meet this body here and you be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye amen and those who are in theophanies come here and pick up their their body that might be ashes by now but he'll glorify it and raise it up hallelujah what hour we're living in and remember that's your day that's who you are that's your message again brother bandam Clint speaks of this and he says Lord Jesus we're people trying to do our best with all this sin is to walk in the light of the Gospel of your great gospel that you died to make right we're so thankful to see in this dark evil Dark Age that we're living now in this hour that we see signs of beer and oh God is the handwriting on the wall we thank the Lord that we can see it and know that Deliverance is close at hand we preach we cross the country we see you work great signs Show Yourself daily every year there's not a year passes but when what great super his Supernatural sign is striking the Earth and we see it knowing that the great Army of God Marches On oh not many in number but what a powerful group that's got eternal life they'll run through a troop and leap over a wall yes the troop of death will have no holders to it she'll run right through it and leap over the wall between natural and Supernatural and go into the arms of God into that great eternity hallelujah amen a people moving into a spear into fear that other churches other ages have never walked in because here we're in the last age we're not going down we're going up remember even on the day of Pentecost they were going down they deteriorated as a seed planted they went down into the ground and instead of coming back Jesus Took on the role of intercessor and started intercessing on behalf of ignorant because the further we got along the more ignorant we become of God's word and so he began to intercede and that's what he's been doing for these 2,000 years but friends he's about to rise from that Throne Hallelujah and when he does he's going to reach and get the book I'm talking about the redeemed those who's got the name in the book he's going to get them and take them in a Rapture and away he'll go with her amen oh now so let me just say you see as they were falling as they fell and every age would rise to only only go into Decline and would have to move into another age into another age but we reached the end speak to this mountain he says I believe the Church of the Living God is moving into spear now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being ask anything you will and it shall be given you anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled remember that's what we're preaching on say to this mountain and it's going to come to pass pretty soon I'm looking for this to happen in this meeting I'm waiting wanting to see it it to happen now that anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she'll rise to her feet like a mighty marching Army the sick will be healed by a word the blind will see the deaf will hear the dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now I believe it's soon coming to pass I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's going to strike that church soon and it's going to start a Revival that has shake the world I believe it and let me tell you it will not shake the count and F and it won't make CNN news and it won't make Fox News but the bride around the world will be shaken by the power of
