[1:01:37] three different readings revelation 3 14
[1:01:39] and unto the angel of the church of the
[1:01:41] laodiceans write these things saith the
[1:01:44] amen the faithful
[1:01:45] and the true witness
[1:01:47] the beginning of the creation of god

[1:01:57] morning

[1:02:01] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[1:02:03] overcame and sat down with my father
[1:02:06] in his throne right there the word says
[1:02:08] that there's going to be overcomers
[1:02:10] the word has already declared it and the
[1:02:12] word is the final say so we know that
[1:02:14] scripture will be fulfilled someone is
[1:02:16] going to overcome laodicea revelation 10
[1:02:20] 7 and we'll read through verse 11
[1:02:23] scripture we all should know well
[1:02:28] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:02:29] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:02:31] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:02:35] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:02:37] servants the prophets and the voice
[1:02:39] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[1:02:40] again and said go and take the little
[1:02:43] book which is open in the hand of the
[1:02:45] angel which standeth upon the sea and
[1:02:47] upon the earth and i went unto the angel
[1:02:49] and said unto him give me the little
[1:02:51] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[1:02:54] it up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:02:56] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:02:58] honey and i took the little book out of
[1:03:02] the angel's hands and ate it ate it up
[1:03:04] and it was in my mouth sweetest honey
[1:03:05] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[1:03:07] was bitter and he said unto me
[1:03:10] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:03:13] peoples and nations and tongues
[1:03:16] and kings amen i pray god add his
[1:03:19] blessing to the word now as you're
[1:03:21] seated
[1:03:23] wonderful scriptures that we've read
[1:03:25] wonderful words of life so much there
[1:03:27] that we can digest and we just want to
[1:03:29] try to find god's leadership this
[1:03:31] morning on which direction and how to
[1:03:33] take this
[1:03:34] last time that we we spoke here in the
[1:03:35] church we we spoke on the final say
[1:03:39] and i want to continue along
[1:03:41] that thought this morning and my title
[1:03:43] today would be the final say
[1:03:45] in the final voice
[1:03:47] the final say
[1:03:49] in the final voice we established last
[1:03:51] time the the supreme authority of god
[1:03:55] in
[1:03:56] and over every situation
[1:03:59] all right that there is only one who has
[1:04:01] the final say and that is the lord jesus
[1:04:04] christ amen our opening scriptures would
[1:04:07] describe him as the amen the faithful
[1:04:10] and the true witness brother brown would
[1:04:12] pick up this and he says i looked up in
[1:04:14] the dictionary webster's according to
[1:04:16] webster's it's perfect in itself talking
[1:04:20] about a amen unlimited in its power
[1:04:23] primarily an ultimate and an ultimate is
[1:04:27] the amen it's unlimited
[1:04:30] in power an absolute it's used many
[1:04:32] times it's the last word it's the amen
[1:04:35] it's
[1:04:36] unlimited there's nothing else in its
[1:04:39] way it's the supreme it's the ultimate
[1:04:41] and an ultimate is when it's because
[1:04:43] you've reached the end it's the amen
[1:04:47] that's all
[1:04:48] he says that's what he is the amen c
[1:04:52] he's got the last word to say
[1:04:56] he is the amen this morning aren't you
[1:04:58] glad that it's him that's holding the
[1:05:00] final say in your life look it's not the
[1:05:02] doctor's report this morning that's the
[1:05:04] final say it's not my opinion of you or
[1:05:07] brother joe's opinion or you or another
[1:05:09] man's opinion of you that is the final
[1:05:11] say it's not what the enemy has told you
[1:05:13] and the plans that the enemy has made
[1:05:15] for your life that is the final say but
[1:05:17] the very one who formed the galaxies the
[1:05:20] very one who blew the sun the moon and
[1:05:22] the stars off the palm of his hands he
[1:05:24] looked at your life and he made plans
[1:05:26] for your life and he said i hold you in
[1:05:28] these hands i have the final say over
[1:05:31] your life regardless of circumstance
[1:05:33] regardless of what the devil has tried
[1:05:35] to do he told peter the devil desires to
[1:05:37] sift you as wheat but i have prayed for
[1:05:39] you so it doesn't matter what the plan
[1:05:41] is of the enemy today in your life that
[1:05:43] doesn't matter my god holds the final
[1:05:46] say in your life
[1:05:48] he is the i am god
[1:05:51] he is the amen
[1:05:53] and that means that not only does he
[1:05:55] have the final say this morning
[1:05:58] he is the final say
[1:06:01] amen that's how we can rest this morning
[1:06:04] brother brother timothy was preaching
[1:06:05] about a place of rest and being unshaken
[1:06:08] that's how we can have rest when things
[1:06:10] that we can't comprehend or things that
[1:06:12] we don't understand when these when
[1:06:14] these things are happening we can still
[1:06:16] rest
[1:06:17] because we know whose hand we're in
[1:06:20] it would be extremely troubling and hard
[1:06:23] to deal with within ourselves
[1:06:25] if every time things turned upside down
[1:06:28] or every time we lost a loved one
[1:06:30] if we felt like the enemy had won
[1:06:34] oh the enemy came in and took that
[1:06:36] person the enemy's doing this to me and
[1:06:38] if we felt that way we would feel beat
[1:06:40] down all the time because things are
[1:06:41] constantly happening to us
[1:06:44] all right if we felt like the enemy had
[1:06:46] the final say in the life of our loved
[1:06:48] one who passed on but we can rest
[1:06:50] knowing that the final say rested in the
[1:06:53] hands of the master
[1:06:54] all right there was no defeat and even
[1:06:57] if we can't wrap our minds around it or
[1:07:00] understand why god's hand was in it
[1:07:03] because the devil never has the final
[1:07:05] say in a believer's life he never has
[1:07:08] the final say brother joe did an
[1:07:09] incredible job on wednesday night
[1:07:12] preaching about the plan of god and how
[1:07:14] it will never be defeated the purpose of
[1:07:17] god in your life will never be defeated
[1:07:19] listen stormy skies rough waters dark
[1:07:22] trials they are not signs of sin in your
[1:07:25] life they are not signs of god's
[1:07:26] displeasure in your life those are not
[1:07:28] look i'm going through a tough trial
[1:07:30] that means god picked you out to defeat
[1:07:32] that thing god looked at you and he said
[1:07:34] i've got confidence in that one they'll
[1:07:36] stand they'll overcome they'll rise
[1:07:38] above it and he picks you and it's not a
[1:07:40] sign of his displeasure
[1:07:43] it's not a sign that satan is gaining
[1:07:45] any kind of victory over you
[1:07:48] but many times it's just molding and
[1:07:50] testing and trying
[1:07:52] and yet all things are working together
[1:07:55] for your good
[1:07:58] sure satan wants to destroy you but he
[1:08:00] can do nothing unless permitted
[1:08:03] by god
[1:08:04] jeremiah 29 11
[1:08:06] for i know
[1:08:08] the thoughts that i think toward you
[1:08:11] saith the lord thoughts of peace and not
[1:08:13] of evil to give you an expected end
[1:08:18] right here thoughts in jeremiah 29
[1:08:22] means plans i know what i've already
[1:08:25] planned for you

[1:08:32] people we should know what the end of
[1:08:33] the story is we should know that the
[1:08:36] seals have been taken off we've read the
[1:08:37] back of the book we know what's going to
[1:08:39] happen

[1:08:42] you know if you take
[1:08:44] i i get onto my daughter all the time
[1:08:46] because she'll get a book and the first
[1:08:47] thing she wants to do is read the end of
[1:08:48] it
[1:08:51] i say why do you do that because the
[1:08:53] rest of it doesn't make me nervous then
[1:08:56] the rest of it doesn't matter i already
[1:08:57] know how it's going to turn out
[1:08:59] come on church
[1:09:01] the rest of it shouldn't make us nervous
[1:09:03] this morning we already know how it's
[1:09:05] gonna turn out we've already seen the
[1:09:07] back of the book the rest of it's just
[1:09:09] drama it's just getting there i know i'm

[1:09:13] happen i know how it ends victory
[1:09:16] eternity everlasting life health healing
[1:09:20] victory over death hell and the grave
[1:09:22] i know how it's going to turn out
[1:09:24] [Applause]
[1:09:25] [Music]
[1:09:26] amen
[1:09:29] satan's plans just don't matter
[1:09:32] satan began making plans in heaven
[1:09:36] to be exalted and worshiped
[1:09:38] and when that didn't go as planned we
[1:09:40] see him in the garden making plans
[1:09:43] bringing deception
[1:09:45] a plan to regain
[1:09:46] position a plan to regain authority
[1:09:50] by causing man to fall and he brings a
[1:09:52] twisted version of the word in the
[1:09:54] garden
[1:09:55] he changes one little word
[1:09:58] just a reminder here
[1:10:00] it all matters
[1:10:03] every part of it matters
[1:10:05] every word matters
[1:10:06] the parts you don't like i hope you like
[1:10:09] it all but how about the parts that are
[1:10:11] hard
[1:10:13] they matter if it's hard on you they
[1:10:15] probably matter the most
[1:10:17] every part of it matters
[1:10:20] he comes and he twists one little word
[1:10:22] and
[1:10:23] he causes adam's bride to fall
[1:10:26] and then adam falls with her
[1:10:28] and the whole earth under adam falls
[1:10:32] all creation
[1:10:34] everything that was under adam because
[1:10:36] he was god of the earth
[1:10:38] it's now in a fallen condition and satan
[1:10:41] thinks i've won
[1:10:42] i've accomplished i'm back
[1:10:44] i'm back to where i wanted to be i'm
[1:10:46] back in power sin and death is now going
[1:10:48] to reign in these mortal bodies
[1:10:50] but right there in that moment
[1:10:53] in the darkest moment of earth's history
[1:10:55] love projects
[1:10:57] and a savior is promised
[1:10:59] and when god says something it's the
[1:11:02] absolute
[1:11:03] when god says something it's the amen
[1:11:05] brother brown says there in the garden
[1:11:06] that morning when sin was so black
[1:11:08] jehovah come in there stood as couple
[1:11:10] standing condemned there would be no
[1:11:12] more human race they had to die death on
[1:11:15] the human race give the world back to
[1:11:17] wild beasts and there'd be no more human
[1:11:19] race but in that darkest of hour in that
[1:11:21] time when all hopes was gone grace come
[1:11:24] pouring through
[1:11:25] how many is thankful for grace this
[1:11:26] morning says i'll give you a savior a
[1:11:29] messiah oh it's wonderful how god could
[1:11:31] ever do it god's amazing grace in the
[1:11:33] garden of eden that give them that
[1:11:35] promise of just one of a just one who
[1:11:38] had come through who would come through
[1:11:39] the woman the woman's seed shall bruise
[1:11:41] the serpent's head the guilty one i love
[1:11:44] how he says that
[1:11:45] not you're the guilty one
[1:11:47] but he's going to bruise the serpent's
[1:11:49] head the guilty one and his head shall
[1:11:51] bruise her heel to show there had been
[1:11:53] an affliction to the church but he
[1:11:55] promised a triumph
[1:11:57] what provided that savior it was grace
[1:12:03] i'm not going to have time to deal with
[1:12:04] this and go down this but just for a
[1:12:05] minute as i came across it it did my
[1:12:08] heart so good and i found found some
[1:12:09] quotes but not only did he come to
[1:12:12] redeem you and i
[1:12:13] but his but his creation of earth
[1:12:16] is going to be redeemed earth is going
[1:12:18] to be redeemed
[1:12:19] everything that satan thought he
[1:12:21] destroyed not only did he think he
[1:12:22] destroyed the human race but he
[1:12:24] destroyed eden he destroyed this
[1:12:25] wonderful earth he had made it a place
[1:12:27] of his eden of darkness of death of
[1:12:29] dying and he says no no but when the
[1:12:32] blood of god fell and struck the earth
[1:12:35] hallelujah he said that blood fell and
[1:12:37] it struck the earth and he said now the
[1:12:38] earth has gone through justification and
[1:12:40] sanctification and it's going to get a
[1:12:42] baptism of fire he said but earth struck
[1:12:44] the blood struck that earth which you
[1:12:47] were a part of
[1:12:48] these bodies being pulled from the earth
[1:12:50] and he says that earth will be redeemed
[1:12:53] for jesus and his bride
[1:12:58] going back over a few things because i
[1:13:00] just want to reestablish in our minds
[1:13:01] that god is in control
[1:13:04] his word is the absolute he is the final
[1:13:06] say
[1:13:07] and he is limitless
[1:13:09] in his power
[1:13:10] get that in our minds today that our god
[1:13:13] is limitless and that's important to
[1:13:15] know because you know satan does have
[1:13:17] power
[1:13:18] satan does have power and yet if you go
[1:13:21] and you'll stack them up and compare the
[1:13:22] two one is extremely limited
[1:13:25] and one is limitless
[1:13:27] one has limitations on it one has no
[1:13:30] limitations on it and let me go ahead
[1:13:31] and tell you the one that is unlimited
[1:13:33] is our conqueror the one that is
[1:13:34] unlimited is our savior the one that is
[1:13:37] unlimited is our chief captain we are on
[1:13:39] the side of limitless power
[1:13:42] and we're going up against one who is
[1:13:43] limited
[1:13:46] the powers that satan possess are
[1:13:48] subject to the word of god
[1:13:51] god says stop
[1:13:53] he has to stop
[1:13:55] sickness is commanded to go it has to go
[1:13:58] a storm is commanded to peace be still
[1:14:01] it has to cease because the power of god
[1:14:04] is unlimited and the power of satan has
[1:14:07] limitations it is limited by the power
[1:14:10] of the word it is limited by the power
[1:14:12] of the holy spirit when he's told that's
[1:14:14] far enough
[1:14:17] oh come on church when he's told that's
[1:14:19] far enough that's far enough he has to
[1:14:22] stop i say there's got to be some people
[1:14:23] this morning that say satan that's far
[1:14:26] enough
[1:14:27] you've gone far enough you won't take
[1:14:29] another step in my life you won't take
[1:14:31] another step in my home you're not
[1:14:33] taking another step in my promises that
[1:14:35] is far enough
[1:14:38] you've done all you're gonna do
[1:14:40] there's gonna be no more robbing me of
[1:14:42] my joy
[1:14:43] no more robbing me of my blessings of my
[1:14:45] children
[1:14:46] you have gone far enough it's time to
[1:14:49] look at the storm and say peace be still
[1:14:51] this morning
[1:14:52] it's time that we begin to operate in
[1:14:54] the privileges and remember all your
[1:14:57] benefits
[1:14:59] that have been given unto you
[1:15:01] the devil you will not have the final
[1:15:03] say in my life
[1:15:05] you will not have the final say in my
[1:15:06] health you will not have the final say
[1:15:08] in my walk with the lord
[1:15:12] there's going to be no more robbing me
[1:15:14] because he's subject to the word of god
[1:15:16] so take the word of god and apply it to
[1:15:18] your situation
[1:15:20] there's going to be no more robbing me
[1:15:22] of my praise
[1:15:25] look there's victory in your praise
[1:15:27] and that's why he wants to rob you of
[1:15:29] your praise so many times we think when
[1:15:31] i get victory i'm going to shout when i
[1:15:33] get victory i'm going to dance when i
[1:15:35] get victory how happy i'm going to be
[1:15:37] that's fine and those things happen but
[1:15:38] sometimes victory is on the other side
[1:15:40] of the praise sometimes victory's over
[1:15:42] there and how do i get to it i'm going
[1:15:44] to praise my way to it i'm going to
[1:15:45] thank him for it i'm going to shout i'm
[1:15:47] going to dance i'm going to sing i'ma
[1:15:49] say thank you lord jesus and the devil's
[1:15:52] trying to get you to sit down and shut
[1:15:53] up i can't my victory's right over there
[1:15:56] and i'm going to praise my way to it

[1:17:44] i'm just saying why are we here
[1:17:47] don't sit here and dwell on tomorrow
[1:17:49] don't sit here and think about what
[1:17:50] happened during the day today think
[1:17:52] about what he's done for us
[1:17:55] circumstances of life are difficult
[1:17:58] but remember that he is a god that
[1:17:59] defies circumstances
[1:18:02] come on church
[1:18:03] he is a god that defies symptoms
[1:18:05] he is a god that defies logic you may be
[1:18:08] in a bad spot this morning you may have
[1:18:10] been going through a rough patch but he
[1:18:12] promised to be here this morning he
[1:18:14] promised that he would be in our midst
[1:18:16] he promised that he was going to show up
[1:18:17] and when he shows up it changes
[1:18:19] everything
[1:18:20] when he walks up to the grave it changes
[1:18:23] everything
[1:18:24] when he speaks nothing else matters
[1:18:26] because he is the final say it doesn't
[1:18:28] matter how long you've been in that sick
[1:18:30] condition this morning it doesn't matter
[1:18:32] how long you've carried that bitterness
[1:18:33] and that unforgiveness this morning it
[1:18:35] doesn't matter how long you've been in
[1:18:37] sin this morning it doesn't matter how
[1:18:39] bad things have been at work it doesn't
[1:18:41] matter if the man was in the grave for
[1:18:42] four days
[1:18:44] none of that mattered he didn't walk up
[1:18:46] and say if i'd only been here he'd have
[1:18:48] lived
[1:18:50] if i'd only showed up sooner but he
[1:18:52] walked up and he said where have you
[1:18:53] laid him
[1:18:54] where have you laid him
[1:18:56] where have you laid the things that
[1:18:57] satan tried to rob from you where have
[1:18:59] you laid your hopes and dreams this
[1:19:01] morning where have you laid the ones
[1:19:02] you've given up on this morning because
[1:19:05] he's walking up this morning where have
[1:19:07] you laid your hopes
[1:19:09] where have you laid the things that you
[1:19:11] gave up on and just said they'll never
[1:19:12] happen wherever you laid them this
[1:19:14] morning
[1:19:15] where's your joy buried
[1:19:17] where's your piece buried at this
[1:19:19] morning
[1:19:20] he's walking up to the tomb of lazarus
[1:19:23] this morning
[1:19:24] he's walking up to your tomb this
[1:19:25] morning where is he buried at
[1:19:30] my peace was robbed from me at a young
[1:19:31] age

[1:19:48] you're a nobody nobody cares about you
[1:19:51] you're of no value to anyone anymore
[1:19:53] you're not worthy
[1:19:55] and those scars became your grave
[1:19:56] clothes
[1:19:58] and you got all wrapped up in those
[1:19:59] things
[1:20:00] and they're binding you this morning and
[1:20:02] they're binding you in your walk and the
[1:20:04] devil put you in a tomb and he rolled a
[1:20:06] stone over your life and he rode a stone
[1:20:08] over the person that god intended you to
[1:20:10] be all along
[1:20:12] and death
[1:20:13] and corruption have had their say
[1:20:16] but corruption knew its master

[1:20:29] there's grave clothes but there's one
[1:20:31] here this morning that has the final say

[1:20:57] and he
[1:20:58] that was dead came forth
[1:21:00] bound hand and foot with grave clothes
[1:21:02] and his face was bound about with a
[1:21:04] napkin and jesus said unto them
[1:21:07] loose him
[1:21:09] and let him go
[1:21:11] jesus had the final say that morning
[1:21:14] those grave clothes can't hold you if
[1:21:16] you want to come forth this morning
[1:21:19] that sin can't hold you if you want to
[1:21:20] come forth this morning
[1:21:25] back in genesis god had promised a
[1:21:27] redeemer
[1:21:28] god had promised the savior and here he
[1:21:30] is
[1:21:31] four thousand years later
[1:21:34] the manifestation of all the old
[1:21:36] testament prophecies
[1:21:38] god with skin on him
[1:21:40] doing the works of god
[1:21:43] but in humanity
[1:21:45] a second adam
[1:21:48] brother branham says he is the god of
[1:21:50] the amen
[1:21:51] he never changes what he does never
[1:21:53] changes he says it and it stands fast he
[1:21:56] does it and it is done forever
[1:21:58] none can take from what he says or add
[1:22:00] to it so let it be
[1:22:02] so let it be aren't you glad that you
[1:22:04] served that kind of god this morning you
[1:22:07] know exactly where you are with him at
[1:22:09] any time and all the time he is the amen
[1:22:11] god
[1:22:12] and won't change
[1:22:14] these things saith the amen i like that
[1:22:17] it means that whatever he said is final
[1:22:19] it means that whatever he said to the
[1:22:20] first age and to the second to all the
[1:22:22] ages about his own true church and about
[1:22:25] the false vine is exactly right and it
[1:22:28] won't change
[1:22:29] it means that what he started out with
[1:22:31] in genesis
[1:22:33] he will finish
[1:22:34] in revelation
[1:22:36] aren't you glad for that what he started
[1:22:38] out with in genesis
[1:22:40] he will finish
[1:22:42] in revelation
[1:22:45] he starts the plan of redemption right
[1:22:47] there in genesis and then down
[1:22:49] down through time every story that's
[1:22:50] told every type every life live is
[1:22:54] building towards the manifestation of a
[1:22:57] redeemer
[1:22:58] types and shadows and prophecies they're
[1:23:01] all pointing toward his coming
[1:23:05] a spoken word son of god
[1:23:08] born of a virgin
[1:23:09] one who would restore
[1:23:11] one who would wipe away tears one who
[1:23:13] would wipe away the curse of death one
[1:23:15] who would make the blind to see one who
[1:23:17] would make the death to hear and one who
[1:23:19] would make the lame to walk and one who
[1:23:21] would bridge the gap and bring man and
[1:23:23] god back into fellowship once again
[1:23:26] and here he stands
[1:23:28] stands there on the earth doing god
[1:23:30] things
[1:23:32] in the body of a man the full
[1:23:34] manifestation of all the word
[1:23:37] doing exactly what the word
[1:23:39] said he would do
[1:23:41] and the whole time what's amazing about
[1:23:43] it brother joe is the entire time satan
[1:23:45] has been trying to stop the plan
[1:23:47] ever since the book of genesis ever
[1:23:48] since the fall recognizing that god's
[1:23:51] trying to work this out and he's trying
[1:23:52] to stop it and he's trying to move here
[1:23:54] and he's trying to stop this seed and
[1:23:56] he's trying to stop this one here and
[1:23:58] he's trying to ruin this one and he's
[1:24:00] trying to kill this one and he's trying
[1:24:01] to stop this one if you haven't figured
[1:24:03] it out yet he can't stop it if you
[1:24:05] haven't figured it out yet he's tried to
[1:24:06] stop you and he's tried to bury you and
[1:24:08] he tried to hinder you but this seed
[1:24:10] came to this one and this one came
[1:24:11] through this world war and it came down
[1:24:13] here and it came to there and this one
[1:24:15] met this when you're like why is all
[1:24:16] this happening my life's a mess your
[1:24:18] life's not a mess it was orchestrated by
[1:24:20] almighty god and here you sit this
[1:24:23] morning because his plan was working the
[1:24:25] whole time
[1:24:27] here you are because god had the final
[1:24:29] say over your life
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:32] no matter what he tried no matter what
[1:24:34] he did
[1:24:36] he may not realize it but he's playing
[1:24:37] right into the hands of god
[1:24:40] right into the plan of god
[1:24:42] we see it with hitler
[1:24:45] how awful that is
[1:24:47] how terrible
[1:24:49] the murder of millions of jews
[1:24:53] brother branham said that was the tender
[1:24:55] hand of jehovah
[1:24:58] them right back to where they're
[1:24:59] supposed to be
[1:25:00] how many times is he moving us to where
[1:25:02] we're supposed to be and it seems like
[1:25:04] the devil's wearing me out
[1:25:07] and god knows no no i know the plans
[1:25:09] i've made
[1:25:11] i know the plans i've made he's just
[1:25:13] moving you and satan thinks oh i got him
[1:25:15] oh i'm moving he's moving me all right
[1:25:16] moving me right into a place where i can
[1:25:18] receive the promise moving me right into
[1:25:20] a place oh sure they were mad when they
[1:25:22] got got taxed in the days of joseph and
[1:25:24] they had to go back but it was all in
[1:25:26] the plan of god
[1:25:28] all moving according to the plan of god
[1:25:30] thinking that he's doing something
[1:25:32] even with the crucifixion of jesus
[1:25:34] brother brown said had he known
[1:25:36] he would have never let that blood be
[1:25:38] shed
[1:25:39] had he known he would have never killed
[1:25:41] him he'd have tried to protect him stay
[1:25:43] back don't touch him
[1:25:46] i don't want this blood shed
[1:25:48] but once again thinking he was doing his
[1:25:50] worst thinking he was winning once again
[1:25:52] he was playing right into redemption's
[1:25:54] plan
[1:25:56] that's why it seems so many times that
[1:25:58] satan it seems that satan is so
[1:25:59] successful
[1:26:01] he's doing so much he's ruined this
[1:26:03] earth he's attacked my family it seems
[1:26:05] that he's so successful and yet he's a
[1:26:07] total and absolute failure
[1:26:11] god allows what looks like victories for
[1:26:14] him and yet it's all working towards
[1:26:16] total victory for you
[1:26:21] god says i know the plans that i've made
[1:26:24] for you and the plan of god will not be
[1:26:26] and cannot be stopped because our god is
[1:26:29] the final say
[1:26:30] listen satan operates in the now
[1:26:33] he has to react to it oh wait god did
[1:26:34] this now wait one what's he doing
[1:26:37] he got me last time
[1:26:40] i got you every time
[1:26:42] hey but but how am i gonna react i'm
[1:26:43] trying to figure it out and yet god's
[1:26:45] plan was finalized before the foundation
[1:26:47] of the world knowing exactly how the
[1:26:48] devil will react to everything that he
[1:26:50] did
[1:26:51] and making it turn and work exactly to
[1:26:53] to his plan and work for your good how
[1:26:56] is he going to stop you from getting
[1:26:58] your name written on the land's book of
[1:26:59] life when it was written on the book of
[1:27:01] life before the foundation of the world
[1:27:03] how can he stop something from happening
[1:27:05] and that's already happened he can't do
[1:27:07] it you've already been seen in the
[1:27:09] vision your name's already been written
[1:27:11] down your names are engraved in the
[1:27:12] palms of his hand what's he gonna do
[1:27:14] about it nothing he can't do a thing
[1:27:17] about it he can't stop the end from
[1:27:19] coming to pass it's already been written
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:25] so what are you worried about
[1:27:27] what do you tore up about oh am i going
[1:27:29] to make it
[1:27:30] oh what if the devil does this and what
[1:27:32] if i mess up today
[1:27:34] the amen's already spoke
[1:27:37] the amen has already spoken your name's
[1:27:39] already been written down
[1:27:41] look he can no more stop you than he
[1:27:43] could stop jesus
[1:27:45] he couldn't stop joseph he just
[1:27:47] fulfilled the plan of god he couldn't
[1:27:48] stop job he just ended up getting
[1:27:50] blessed twice as much as he was before
[1:27:52] he failed to stop jesus he couldn't stop
[1:27:55] the true church that was born there on
[1:27:56] the day of pentecost
[1:27:58] he tried to stomp it out with
[1:27:59] persecution he fed him the lines he
[1:28:01] burned them at the stake he covered it
[1:28:03] up with false doctrines he tried to make
[1:28:05] the church cold and formal he ate the
[1:28:08] leaves off the tree
[1:28:09] to where the tree was totally bare but
[1:28:12] the amen had already written in the word
[1:28:14] i will restore
[1:28:16] before he ever ate one leaf off the tree
[1:28:19] before he did one thing that i am looked
[1:28:21] down and said i'm gonna restore what the
[1:28:23] devil's gonna do
[1:28:27] the amen had already spoke
[1:28:30] behold i sent unto you
[1:28:33] elijah the prophet
[1:28:37] sure he ate the leaves off the tree
[1:28:39] sure he ate it down but then out comes
[1:28:41] luther
[1:28:43] then out comes wesley
[1:28:46] already put there
[1:28:48] in the plan of redemption and the plan
[1:28:50] of restoration i will restore here comes

[1:29:13] very plan of god

[1:29:19] bible and you can look and you can see
[1:29:20] oh okay well satan tried this
[1:29:22] and i see where god countered it there
[1:29:24] and god had already planned for that
[1:29:26] here yeah yeah oh and look at this
[1:29:28] mighty person here and this mighty
[1:29:30] prophet and then he did this and he did

[1:29:54] for me and he called my name and he said
[1:29:57] aaron come forth come forth from that
[1:30:00] walk in freedom
[1:30:02] walk in power walk in victory it's all
[1:30:05] for me
[1:30:07] the plan of god unfolding just for you
[1:30:10] not stopped not hindered but what he
[1:30:13] started in genesis marching right on
[1:30:16] all the way to revelation the full plan
[1:30:18] of redemption the plan
[1:30:21] to have
[1:30:22] a bride
[1:30:27] what he started in genesis carried all
[1:30:29] the way over
[1:30:30] finished in revelation
[1:30:33] see the whole time
[1:30:34] the word was not only pointing to a
[1:30:36] second adam
[1:30:39] it was also
[1:30:41] pointing to another eve
[1:30:44] an eve that would not fall
[1:30:47] joseph rejected by his brothers takes a
[1:30:49] gentile bride a queen accepted by the
[1:30:52] king and given even half the kingdom
[1:30:54] there in esther
[1:30:55] a bride that is redeemed by kinsmen and
[1:30:58] ruth
[1:30:59] one thing after another
[1:31:01] pointing to it
[1:31:03] a determined god i will have a bride
[1:31:05] that will not fall
[1:31:07] an enemy determined
[1:31:09] i'm gonna stop it
[1:31:11] confident that just like in the garden
[1:31:13] he would make this bride fall and a god
[1:31:16] so sure that you wouldn't he said
[1:31:19] i'm gonna go prepare a place
[1:31:23] so confident that you'd make it so
[1:31:25] confident that you'd overcome so
[1:31:27] confident that the deposit that he
[1:31:29] placed on the inside of you would
[1:31:31] manifest itself in this last day he said
[1:31:33] i don't even got to worry about it i go
[1:31:36] to prepare a place that where i am there
[1:31:38] you may be also he knows you're coming
[1:31:41] he knows you're going to make it he
[1:31:43] provided the way he's confident in the
[1:31:45] deposit that he put down on the inside
[1:31:47] of you he's confident
[1:31:50] in himself
[1:31:51] [Applause]
[1:31:56] excuse me i'm sorry
[1:31:59] early in the ephesian age
[1:32:05] paul is writing second corinthians 11 2
[1:32:08] for i'm jealous over you with godly
[1:32:10] jealousy
[1:32:11] for i've espoused you to one husband
[1:32:14] that i may present you as a chaste
[1:32:15] version to christ
[1:32:19] but i fear
[1:32:20] lest by any means as the serpent
[1:32:22] beguiled eve through his subtlety so
[1:32:25] your mind should be corrupted from the
[1:32:27] simplicity that is in christ
[1:32:30] we already see what the enemy did in
[1:32:32] the garden of eden
[1:32:34] he's trying to do again with this one
[1:32:37] brother branham says so way back there
[1:32:38] in the early church a very short period
[1:32:40] after pentecost the false vine
[1:32:43] got to interwine itself around the true
[1:32:45] vine
[1:32:46] and we find the deeds of the nicolaitans
[1:32:49] he says they got people to obey them
[1:32:52] until the time came that their way of
[1:32:54] worship
[1:32:55] did not anyway at all resemble the early
[1:32:58] days after pentecost
[1:33:00] sounds so familiar
[1:33:03] says it got them to where their worship
[1:33:06] did not in any way at all resemble the
[1:33:08] early days
[1:33:09] of pentecost
[1:33:11] and so satan comes in the attacks just
[1:33:13] like he did eve and he changes one word
[1:33:15] here
[1:33:16] and he changes one word there and now
[1:33:18] the wolves have entered in
[1:33:20] and it seems so subtle and innocent even
[1:33:22] at first but but soon deeds become
[1:33:24] doctrines
[1:33:26] and before long the church
[1:33:28] is aimed at
[1:33:30] but relaxed
[1:33:31] the church has left her first love
[1:33:34] and there's a lukewarmness that has
[1:33:36] begun to creep in it has become nothing
[1:33:38] more than cold formal worship
[1:33:40] and the experience has been traded out
[1:33:43] for head knowledge
[1:33:45] this is what happened to the first age
[1:33:48] and once you do that
[1:33:51] then the things that are taught from the
[1:33:52] pulpit can be changed and manipulated
[1:33:55] because there is no personal
[1:33:57] relationship with god
[1:33:58] and because you don't have that
[1:34:00] relationship and you're relying on man
[1:34:02] to feed you then when things that are
[1:34:04] wrong or said that little alarm bell
[1:34:06] doesn't go off
[1:34:08] because you don't have that's why they
[1:34:10] want you to trade in that personal
[1:34:11] relationship for head knowledge because
[1:34:14] head knowledge can be manipulated
[1:34:17] head knowledge can be changed and over
[1:34:19] time one little word here over a period
[1:34:21] of time
[1:34:22] it's like those of you who have ever
[1:34:23] shot a gun if it's off an inch at 50
[1:34:25] yards it's gonna be off a lot of inches
[1:34:28] when it gets on down the range
[1:34:31] so one word changed here and you begin
[1:34:33] to accept things that you wouldn't have
[1:34:36] because there is no holy ghost
[1:34:38] leadership
[1:34:39] in the church
[1:34:41] so you're relying on men to provide you
[1:34:43] with what you need and they become your
[1:34:45] leader instead of the holy ghost
[1:34:49] and now the divide between truth and
[1:34:52] what you're being fed grows
[1:34:56] exponentially if you'll look from the
[1:34:58] day of pentecost to just an age or two
[1:35:00] later it doesn't even resemble the same
[1:35:02] thing
[1:35:03] if you look at the catholic church today
[1:35:06] and try to compare it to the church that
[1:35:08] was started on pentecost
[1:35:09] it's not even the same religion
[1:35:12] it may be called christianity but it's
[1:35:15] not even the same religion they're not
[1:35:17] followers of christ
[1:35:19] because they accepted the leadership of
[1:35:21] man and they substituted the experience
[1:35:24] for head knowledge
[1:35:28] why do you think
[1:35:30] why do you think that those that operate
[1:35:32] underneath this spirit even within our
[1:35:34] our message are so against you listening
[1:35:36] to other preachers
[1:35:39] because they need you to rely on them
[1:35:41] and their teachings and not come in
[1:35:43] contact with too much truth
[1:35:46] they don't want you coming into in
[1:35:48] contact with too much truth why are they
[1:35:49] so against you going to a meeting where
[1:35:51] the holy ghost is moving
[1:35:54] because unlike paul their desire is to
[1:35:57] espouse you to themselves
[1:35:59] and not to the holy spirit so they build
[1:36:02] a fence around you and and hold you to
[1:36:04] themselves under the guise of protection
[1:36:07] i want to protect you from that stuff i
[1:36:09] want to protect you from that moving
[1:36:13] and in that time satan eats away until
[1:36:15] there's almost nothing left
[1:36:17] until it doesn't even resemble what god
[1:36:19] started in the upper room
[1:36:22] satan thinks
[1:36:23] to himself
[1:36:25] this one's falling just like eve
[1:36:27] this wasn't hard this took no time
[1:36:30] brother brown said it wasn't long after
[1:36:32] the upper room it had already wormed its
[1:36:33] way in
[1:36:35] but the amen had already said brother
[1:36:36] johnny i'm gonna have a bride
[1:36:39] that's it the rest what is the rest of
[1:36:41] it drama
[1:36:42] he'd already said i'm gonna have a bride
[1:36:45] he had shown there in eden how she would
[1:36:47] be when adam said this is bone of my
[1:36:48] bone and this is flesh of my flesh
[1:36:51] church we're gonna be just like him men
[1:36:54] can come and teach head knowledge men
[1:36:56] can come and teach this and say that but
[1:36:58] the ministry of the bride is gonna match
[1:37:00] exactly to the ministry of the groom she
[1:37:03] will be just like he is
[1:37:07] she's going to be just like him
[1:37:09] oh but but satan says look where she's
[1:37:11] falling too
[1:37:12] we haven't even got through the fourth
[1:37:14] age
[1:37:15] it's the fourth church age and it's so
[1:37:17] dark
[1:37:19] there isn't hardly anything left from
[1:37:21] the original tree planted that day on
[1:37:22] pentecost
[1:37:23] but the amen said i'm going to restore
[1:37:27] brother brown says but what he was god's
[1:37:29] perfect prophet tree the example tree
[1:37:32] the bridegroom tree hey man glory i'm
[1:37:34] going to say something directly if he's
[1:37:36] the bridegroom tree do you believe it
[1:37:38] from the garden of eden and the
[1:37:40] bridegroom tree without the female don't
[1:37:41] bear fruit so he's got to have a bright
[1:37:44] tree she's got to be born of the same
[1:37:46] material the word made flesh in the tree
[1:37:50] hope you get it it's the same life in
[1:37:52] this female tree the bridegroom as it is
[1:37:55] in the bride the works that i do shall
[1:37:58] you do also is that right
[1:38:01] yes so he begins to restore it's eating
[1:38:04] down to nothing
[1:38:05] it's eat down to there's nothing left
[1:38:06] it's all based on head knowledge and the
[1:38:08] head knowledge has gotten a million
[1:38:09] miles away
[1:38:11] but luther breaks away from the false
[1:38:12] vine
[1:38:13] and he preaches justification
[1:38:16] and then wesley comes and he preaches
[1:38:18] sanctification what is it it's a tree
[1:38:22] being restored
[1:38:23] it's the bride tree being built back up
[1:38:27] and yet there were still claims that
[1:38:29] satan could hold over the church
[1:38:31] there were still false baptisms
[1:38:33] there were still false teachings of the
[1:38:35] godhead
[1:38:36] the tree wasn't producing the fruits
[1:38:38] that god had intended it to produce
[1:38:41] yes it had come a little ways and it had
[1:38:43] grown a little bit but it still wasn't
[1:38:45] matching him
[1:38:46] this was not bone of his bone
[1:38:49] although there were glimpses
[1:38:51] there were glimpses of it
[1:38:53] oh that's how it was
[1:38:55] oh there's there's a glimpse of it and
[1:38:56] yet there were claims over that church
[1:39:00] so what's he looking for
[1:39:02] this
[1:39:02] was not the ministry of jesus christ
[1:39:06] being repeated
[1:39:07] and that is what he's looking for
[1:39:09] brother branham says there's got to come
[1:39:10] one in this last day a restoration of
[1:39:12] the church the bride tree that was eat
[1:39:15] down back yonder by the canker worms and
[1:39:17] the palmer worms and all kinds of
[1:39:18] insects that eat all the brotherly love
[1:39:20] and fruits away from it there's got to
[1:39:22] come a church again where those barriers
[1:39:24] will be broke and the holy ghost will
[1:39:26] have the right of way among the people
[1:39:28] when you do you will see the same signs
[1:39:30] and wonders that happened back there in
[1:39:32] them days
[1:39:33] thus what the church was at pentecost
[1:39:36] now listen
[1:39:38] brother aaron why do y'all harp so much
[1:39:40] on this
[1:39:42] on the gifts and the movement of the
[1:39:43] spirit
[1:39:44] why do you harp so much on on on turn
[1:39:47] back to the original pentecost listen to
[1:39:49] this
[1:39:50] thus what the church was at pentecost is
[1:39:53] the standard
[1:39:55] that is the pattern
[1:39:58] there is no other pattern no matter what
[1:40:02] the scholars say god has not changed
[1:40:04] that pattern what god did at pentecost
[1:40:07] he has to keep on doing until the church
[1:40:10] ages close
[1:40:12] so if you will admit that we are still
[1:40:13] in the church ages that this is still
[1:40:15] the layout of seeing age he has to keep
[1:40:17] doing exactly what he did at pentecost
[1:40:20] that is the pattern of the church we're
[1:40:21] not patterning after other people we're
[1:40:23] not patterned after other churches we're
[1:40:25] trying to pattern after the book of acts
[1:40:28] church because that is the pattern
[1:40:30] that is what we are to be that is who we
[1:40:33] are to be
[1:40:36] luther came and wesley came and there
[1:40:38] were glimpses but it still wasn't the
[1:40:39] pattern
[1:40:42] there still had to be more
[1:40:46] than the azusa street revival
[1:40:48] and a restoration of gifts
[1:40:51] make no mistake about it that was part
[1:40:53] of the restoration
[1:40:56] and if god thought that it needed to be
[1:40:58] restored then why in the world would we
[1:41:00] think it's not needed
[1:41:03] god went through a lot of trouble to
[1:41:04] make sure it was restored and then we
[1:41:05] went oh we don't need that
[1:41:07] thanks now we're good
[1:41:10] really
[1:41:11] god thought it needed to be restored
[1:41:15] and if he thought it needed to be
[1:41:17] restored then it must
[1:41:19] be needed
[1:41:22] we don't need the gifts anymore those
[1:41:24] things are no longer very even going on
[1:41:26] you know the very reason they had to be
[1:41:28] restored is if you go back far enough
[1:41:30] into the first age you would find people
[1:41:31] thinking just like that
[1:41:33] we don't need that anymore we don't need
[1:41:34] to speak anytime yeah that happened a
[1:41:36] few years ago you know a few places but
[1:41:38] we've moved beyond that and now we have
[1:41:40] a deeper revelation of the word and so
[1:41:42] those things are not tongues and they're
[1:41:43] not needed those things aren't and so
[1:41:44] because of that attitude they were lost
[1:41:47] church we can't afford to lose anything
[1:41:48] that god has restored in this age
[1:41:50] because there ain't time to go through
[1:41:51] that process all over again we're at the
[1:41:53] end
[1:41:54] we got to grab a hold to everything
[1:41:56] god's given us everything he restore and
[1:41:58] say yes that's mine i'll take it if god
[1:42:00] says it's mine it's mine if he says it's
[1:42:01] in the church it's in the church i'll
[1:42:03] take all of it you may not think it's
[1:42:05] important but if he thought it was
[1:42:06] important enough to restore it must be
[1:42:08] something that i need in this last day
[1:42:10] so i want it all i want to take it i
[1:42:12] want to hold on to it we can't give back
[1:42:14] to the enemy what god has restored
[1:42:18] and so once again the azusa street move
[1:42:20] comes and once again there are fruits of
[1:42:22] the spirit being manifested
[1:42:24] the tree was beginning to take shape and
[1:42:26] yet there must come something else still
[1:42:29] something's missing
[1:42:31] there's got to be something else
[1:42:32] something to turn us
[1:42:36] turn us to what
[1:42:38] brother brother says but what i said was
[1:42:41] that because of the unchanging god with
[1:42:43] unchanging ways we can go back to the
[1:42:45] beginning and see the first and perfect
[1:42:47] act of god and then judge by that
[1:42:50] standard
[1:42:51] perfect
[1:42:52] act of god and judge by that standard
[1:42:55] that is how it's done the true church
[1:42:57] will always try
[1:42:58] to be like the original at pentecost
[1:43:01] the true church of today will try to
[1:43:03] approximate that early first one
[1:43:08] and just like in every other instance
[1:43:11] oh something's lacking
[1:43:13] we need something
[1:43:15] don't worry he's already provided it
[1:43:18] just like in every other instance the
[1:43:19] amen the final say had already spoken
[1:43:22] and it was already laying right there in
[1:43:24] the word he was already so many steps
[1:43:26] ahead of the enemy laying right there
[1:43:28] all these years in malachi 4 5 it says
[1:43:30] behold
[1:43:31] i will send you elijah the prophet
[1:43:33] before the coming of the great and
[1:43:34] dreadful day of the lord and he will
[1:43:36] turn the hearts back to the faith
[1:43:40] of the fathers
[1:43:41] and that message comes forth in power
[1:43:43] and it called forth a restored bride
[1:43:46] with a restored word and it restored her
[1:43:49] to a position to where i can stand here
[1:43:51] this morning and tell you that you are
[1:43:53] the manifestation of the spoken word of
[1:43:57] god
[1:43:58] you are that's good brother aaron my i
[1:44:02] was wondering about that this morning
[1:44:05] i don't think you were
[1:44:07] you are the manifestation
[1:44:10] of the spoken word of god brother
[1:44:13] branham says and now remember you
[1:44:14] christians
[1:44:15] were his thoughts before there was a
[1:44:18] world and you are the manifestation
[1:44:21] of
[1:44:22] his thinking
[1:44:24] hallelujah that does something to me
[1:44:26] maybe not to you but i am the
[1:44:27] manifestation of god's thinking i am
[1:44:30] part of his plans i am part of what he
[1:44:32] laid out before the foundation of the
[1:44:33] world then what devil can stop me what
[1:44:36] devil can hold me what depression what
[1:44:38] anxiety what fear what sickness what
[1:44:39] death what grade none of it can stop me
[1:44:42] because i'm the manifestation of the
[1:44:43] very thinking of god once again in flesh
[1:44:46] upon the earth what can stand in my way
[1:44:50] nothing can stand in my way
[1:44:53] and now just like the time to where
[1:44:55] everything that was pointing to jesus
[1:44:57] became flesh and he stood in a body upon
[1:44:59] the earth and he went about tearing down
[1:45:01] satan's kingdom he went about showing
[1:45:03] that death didn't have to be feared that
[1:45:05] sickness didn't have to be feared he
[1:45:07] showed that the grave didn't have any
[1:45:08] victory and just as the groom did those
[1:45:11] things just as the groom proved that he
[1:45:13] had the final say over the enemy now
[1:45:15] there is a bride the manifestation of
[1:45:18] the word and flesh again doing the exact
[1:45:20] same works
[1:45:22] death doesn't have to be fear sickness
[1:45:24] doesn't have to be feared sin doesn't
[1:45:26] have to be feared we are him in flesh
[1:45:29] once again
[1:45:31] the manifestation of the word and flesh
[1:45:33] again
[1:45:36] and nothing can stand before you
[1:45:39] because
[1:45:41] you
[1:45:43] or the final say
[1:45:48] you are the final say over the enemy
[1:45:51] devils i recommend you get out of my way
[1:45:52] this morning
[1:45:56] because regardless of what you do and
[1:45:58] what attack you bring i have the final
[1:46:00] say over you i can take the word of god
[1:46:02] right now and put it upon my lips and
[1:46:03] it's the same as deity speaking i curse
[1:46:05] you in the name of jesus every spirit of
[1:46:07] fear every spirit of depression every

[1:46:42] silent it's not time to be pushed around
[1:46:45] but rise to the occasion take your
[1:46:47] authority and speak what you have need
[1:46:50] of
[1:46:51] hallelujah
[1:46:55] brother brown says they are one
[1:46:57] same word
[1:46:59] the same word that spoke of the groom
[1:47:01] speaks of the bride
[1:47:03] and as he being the groom the bride has
[1:47:05] to come forth
[1:47:07] because it's part of him
[1:47:09] and it can only be the manifestation of
[1:47:11] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:47:14] any others has spoke of the bride
[1:47:17] as a mouthful
[1:47:21] it can only manifest if it does
[1:47:23] something different from the groom
[1:47:26] it isn't the bride
[1:47:27] because she is flesh of his flesh bone
[1:47:29] of his bone life of his life power of
[1:47:32] his power
[1:47:34] she
[1:47:35] is him
[1:47:37] then i say prepare for the same results
[1:47:39] he got
[1:47:40] prepare for the same results he got
[1:47:43] we have seen them and we will see more
[1:47:46] we have seen the prodigals come home and
[1:47:48] we will see more we have seen cancer
[1:47:49] defeated and we will see more
[1:47:51] hallelujah
[1:47:53] we have seen the lame walk and we will
[1:47:54] see more we have seen those filled with
[1:47:56] the holy ghost and we will see more
[1:47:58] because she is him repeating the
[1:48:00] ministry of jesus christ on the earth
[1:48:02] once again
[1:48:04] a momentary consideration of the church
[1:48:06] history will prove how accurate this
[1:48:08] thought is
[1:48:09] in the dark ages the word was almost
[1:48:11] entirely lost to the people but god sent
[1:48:13] luther with the word
[1:48:15] the lutheran spoke for god at that time
[1:48:17] but they organized
[1:48:20] and again the pure word was lost for
[1:48:22] organization tends towards dogma and
[1:48:23] creeds
[1:48:25] they could no longer speak for god then
[1:48:26] god sent wesley and he was the voice
[1:48:28] with the word in his day
[1:48:30] the people who took his revelation from
[1:48:32] god became the living epistles read
[1:48:33] known of all men for their generation
[1:48:36] when the method is failed god raised up
[1:48:37] others and so it has gone through the
[1:48:39] years
[1:48:40] until in this last day
[1:48:42] there is again another people in the
[1:48:44] land
[1:48:45] who under their messenger
[1:48:47] will be the final voice
[1:48:50] to the final age
[1:48:55] why can he trust you with that
[1:49:00] because he knows you're not speaking
[1:49:01] your own thoughts
[1:49:03] he knows
[1:49:05] that she is free from man's thinking
[1:49:07] because he has restored her to a place
[1:49:09] that he can trust her speaking for him
[1:49:15] restored you to a place to such a
[1:49:17] perfect word that he can trust you
[1:49:19] speaking for him what is it that's
[1:49:21] holding you this morning then
[1:49:24] what's holding you
[1:49:26] what haman is coming against your life
[1:49:29] what's coming and threatening your
[1:49:30] family
[1:49:32] come on the only thing that would have
[1:49:33] hindered esther is if she had not went
[1:49:35] in
[1:49:37] but she had to finally quit looking at
[1:49:39] herself as unworthy and what if he don't
[1:49:40] accept me and what if and what if
[1:49:42] and he had to go in
[1:49:44] and once she did and once she confronted
[1:49:46] her haman he said speak in my name
[1:49:50] and seal it with my ring and whatever's
[1:49:52] done in my name and seal with my ring
[1:49:54] let no man stand before it i say what's
[1:49:56] your haman this morning what's coming
[1:49:58] against you and your family this morning
[1:50:00] speak in his name speak in his name and
[1:50:02] go forward seal it with his ring and go
[1:50:04] forward let the proclamation go forth we
[1:50:06] will have victory we can defend
[1:50:07] ourselves we will slay the enemy we will
[1:50:09] ransack their tents we will take
[1:50:11] everything that was taken from us back
[1:50:13] we will have joy and peace and victory
[1:50:15] speak it in his name and go forward
[1:50:18] do you realize how close sometimes we
[1:50:20] look around and look how bad the world
[1:50:21] is though satan he's making he's gaining
[1:50:23] ground do you realize how close haman's
[1:50:25] plan was to succeeding and completely
[1:50:27] wiping out the jewish race
[1:50:29] it was right there until somebody said
[1:50:31] i'm the queen
[1:50:33] i have the right to speak i'll raise up
[1:50:35] to the position i won't back down had
[1:50:38] that one person not spoke the race would
[1:50:40] have been wiped out
[1:50:41] maybe it's in your family if you don't
[1:50:43] speak your family will be wiped out
[1:50:45] maybe it's just you personally
[1:50:47] before the chaos said to her so don't
[1:50:48] think that just because you're in the
[1:50:49] palace if you don't speak that it's
[1:50:51] going to pass over you
[1:50:52] you can't just sit back and go maybe
[1:50:54] it'll skip me maybe it'll pass me no
[1:50:56] this lukewarm layout of seeing spirit
[1:50:57] that's coming for each and every one of
[1:50:59] us it's coming after your homes and your
[1:51:01] children but somebody's going to raise
[1:51:02] them say i'm the queen i'll have the
[1:51:04] seal i have the name of the king i have
[1:51:06] the authority to speak i am him and i
[1:51:09] speak you'll come no further
[1:51:11] you stand still
[1:51:14] hallelujah
[1:51:17] sure satan thought the church was
[1:51:18] defeated just like haman thought i've
[1:51:19] got him we're right there at it
[1:51:25] he thought once again i've won
[1:51:27] the church has taken in the creeds of
[1:51:29] man
[1:51:30] the ideas of man false doctrines false
[1:51:32] baptisms
[1:51:35] but he said i know my plans
[1:51:38] he had spoken a restoration
[1:51:41] and he had a message that would be the
[1:51:42] final say on all these claims against
[1:51:45] the church
[1:51:47] he had a message that would produce a
[1:51:48] people that he could trust to speak for
[1:51:50] him
[1:51:51] the message was the final say on the
[1:51:52] mysteries that's what revelation 10 7
[1:51:55] told us
[1:51:56] it was the final say on the seals it was
[1:51:58] the final say on water baptism it was
[1:52:00] the final say on godhead it was the
[1:52:02] final say on no eternal hell it was all
[1:52:04] the loose ends it was the final say it
[1:52:06] tied it all up
[1:52:08] luther couldn't have the final say
[1:52:10] there were still too many claims on him
[1:52:12] wesley couldn't have the final say there
[1:52:14] were still too many claims on him the
[1:52:16] pentecostals could not have the final
[1:52:18] say there was too many claims on them
[1:52:21] but in this day
[1:52:23] in this generation look those ages
[1:52:26] couldn't have the final say because the
[1:52:27] whole word had not yet been restored
[1:52:29] back
[1:52:30] so they could not have a final say with
[1:52:32] a partial word so there had to be a
[1:52:35] prophet a prophet that would come and
[1:52:38] stand there and receive a message from
[1:52:39] almighty god a message that would come
[1:52:42] and break every claim and strip away
[1:52:44] everything that stood between you and
[1:52:46] full redemption and full manifestation a
[1:52:48] prophet the seventh church age messenger
[1:52:51] to restore all that had been lost
[1:52:54] a prophet to reveal the seals and then
[1:52:56] could the final say be spoken
[1:52:59] then could there come one who was the
[1:53:01] final voice to the final age we couldn't
[1:53:04] be here
[1:53:05] without a prophet first speaking
[1:53:08] do you realize have you ever thought
[1:53:09] that the message spoke you into
[1:53:12] existence
[1:53:17] had william branham not come and this
[1:53:19] message not
[1:53:20] come would we be here this morning
[1:53:24] this bride
[1:53:25] this group
[1:53:27] this worldwide body spoken into
[1:53:29] existence
[1:53:30] by a message
[1:53:35] no other age could do that
[1:53:38] no other age could come
[1:53:40] no other than no other age could have
[1:53:42] the final say
[1:53:44] you say well praise god the seals are
[1:53:46] open
[1:53:47] word is restored that's why we don't
[1:53:49] need
[1:53:49] all your emotion like you have at
[1:53:51] evening like tabernacle all that stuff
[1:53:54] the opening of the word is exactly
[1:53:56] what's bringing the emotion
[1:53:59] that's exactly what we're excited about
[1:54:03] look i don't like to run
[1:54:10] joe wanted so bad to say obviously
[1:54:22] i can't dance
[1:54:23] i don't like to and i'm being carnal for
[1:54:26] a second
[1:54:28] but when the spirit moves
[1:54:31] and i see my name in the lamb's book of
[1:54:33] life and i can only see it there because
[1:54:36] the seals were ripped off and that's
[1:54:38] what's allowed me to see it then it
[1:54:40] makes me get a little bit excited i may
[1:54:42] come out my chair and run around the
[1:54:43] building i may dance a little bit and
[1:54:45] guess what i won't care even one little
[1:54:46] bit what you think about it because this
[1:54:48] is about me and my god this is about my
[1:54:50] name this is about eternity this is
[1:54:52] about what he did for me this is me i'm
[1:54:55] part of the pride i'm the manifested
[1:54:57] word he did it all for me i've got
[1:54:59] eternity i'm gonna live forever i'm
[1:55:01] gonna overcome i'm gonna make it and it
[1:55:03] gets me excited excited enough to
[1:55:06] exercise a little bit
[1:55:08] that's some excitement in my life
[1:55:10] [Applause]
[1:55:12] that's exactly what's bringing the
[1:55:14] emotion
[1:55:15] john said every creature which was in
[1:55:17] heaven and in the earth and under the
[1:55:19] earth heard i john
[1:55:21] he was shouting and screaming and
[1:55:23] praising the lord
[1:55:25] it brought emotion david danced when the
[1:55:28] word was restored that's what's bringing
[1:55:30] the emotion
[1:55:31] i'm not emotional because you have not
[1:55:34] seen the opening of the word you've got
[1:55:36] a head knowledge of it you've been told
[1:55:37] the stories but once you see it and you
[1:55:40] see you're there that's me mama that's
[1:55:42] me then it brings the emotion and the
[1:55:44] excitement i have eternity
[1:55:47] [Applause]
[1:55:57] it's the age of finality
[1:56:00] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:56:02] angel
[1:56:03] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:56:05] of god should be
[1:56:07] finished
[1:56:08] it's the age of finality it's all
[1:56:10] wrapped up the mystery is finished
[1:56:13] i say you make your calling in election
[1:56:14] sure
[1:56:16] trim the lamps apply the blood
[1:56:19] he said he would send malachi 4. he did
[1:56:20] it
[1:56:22] he said he would have a bride and he
[1:56:24] does
[1:56:25] he said the mysteries would be revealed
[1:56:27] they are
[1:56:29] there is a living breathing spoken word
[1:56:31] bride on the earth
[1:56:32] today
[1:56:34] he says just as the church stands today
[1:56:36] the true living church of god
[1:56:39] without a denomination or anything else
[1:56:40] she stands alone
[1:56:42] but yet she's had the anointing poured
[1:56:44] on her
[1:56:45] she knows what she is
[1:56:48] he had luther
[1:56:50] wesley
[1:56:52] william brown
[1:56:54] a vindicated message
[1:56:56] by a vindicated prophet
[1:56:59] sure there's gonna be those that dispute
[1:57:00] it
[1:57:02] there's gonna be those that the doubt
[1:57:04] the message
[1:57:05] that'll say it isn't the truth or he was
[1:57:07] wrong here he was wrong there and
[1:57:09] they'll try to discredit it
[1:57:12] but we're talking about the amen god
[1:57:16] they've tried to discredit him from the
[1:57:17] beginning of time
[1:57:19] but he's always a step ahead
[1:57:21] he's always got his plans i know the
[1:57:23] plans i've made
[1:57:25] they're going to try to discredit it
[1:57:27] but we're talking about the one who had
[1:57:28] the final say
[1:57:30] time after time he would come down and
[1:57:33] back up what was preached in that
[1:57:35] service with an amen
[1:57:37] he would come and move and he would
[1:57:38] discern hearts and he would speak life
[1:57:41] and he would bring healing and that was
[1:57:42] god coming in and going amen
[1:57:45] what was just preached
[1:57:47] amen that's the truth here's the final
[1:57:50] say
[1:57:51] amen and the amen of god would move and
[1:57:54] he would come and he would put his stamp
[1:57:55] of approval upon what had just been
[1:57:57] preached
[1:57:59] well he didn't say this right well he
[1:58:01] said it right enough that the angel of
[1:58:03] god felt comfortable enough to come down
[1:58:05] behind it and confirm what he just said
[1:58:07] so if we're taking opinions i mean
[1:58:10] i'm going to go there
[1:58:11] well i'm not sure he told this story
[1:58:12] right he told it enough that the angel
[1:58:14] of god came down in the service and
[1:58:16] healed the sick came down and discerned
[1:58:18] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:58:19] and said amen to what was said
[1:58:22] you want to try to discredit it and yet
[1:58:25] thousands upon thousands if not millions
[1:58:28] came night after night after night
[1:58:31] and i would venture to say 99 of them
[1:58:34] did not agree with him and did not
[1:58:36] believe him
[1:58:38] and yet never once with all those people
[1:58:40] there who would love nothing more than
[1:58:42] to see him discredited do you hear
[1:58:43] somebody go that's not true
[1:58:47] he said it wrong
[1:58:48] or somebody in the back hollered that
[1:58:50] was wrong right there i know
[1:58:52] not
[1:58:53] not once
[1:58:56] listen he wasn't preaching to message
[1:58:57] churches
[1:58:59] he was preaching to people that would
[1:59:00] have loved to caught him in error
[1:59:04] and couldn't
[1:59:05] and now they're all gone and suddenly
[1:59:07] you got some kind of evidence
[1:59:10] you've got something that you think you
[1:59:11] can present to me now that all the
[1:59:13] eyewitnesses have passed off the scene
[1:59:16] you can produce some kind of so-called
[1:59:18] evidence look in noah's day they
[1:59:19] produced evidence that it couldn't rain
[1:59:22] but the i am god had the final say
[1:59:25] the i am god is the finality of it the
[1:59:28] absolute of it and he said amen to this
[1:59:30] message
[1:59:31] he said amen to this message and aside
[1:59:33] from all that i've seen what the message
[1:59:35] has produced
[1:59:39] i see what the message produces produces
[1:59:41] the greatest young people in the world
[1:59:42] it produces the greatest people in the
[1:59:44] world it produces people with real true
[1:59:46] love in their heart overcoming sin
[1:59:48] walking according to the word and if you
[1:59:50] have a problem with that i think i know
[1:59:52] where the problem lays
[1:59:56] brother brown says there it is he's
[1:59:57] sending a vindicated prophet he's
[1:59:59] sending a prophet after almost 2
[2:00:01] thousand years he's sending someone who
[2:00:02] is far from organization education in
[2:00:05] the world of religion that is john the
[2:00:07] baptist and elijah of old he will hear
[2:00:09] only from god and he will have thus
[2:00:10] sayeth the lord and speak for god he
[2:00:12] will be god's mouthpiece and he as it is
[2:00:15] declared in malachi 4 6 will turn the
[2:00:17] heart to the children back to the
[2:00:18] fathers he will bring back the elect of
[2:00:20] the last day and they will hear a
[2:00:21] vindicated prophet give the exact truth
[2:00:24] as it was with paul he will restore the
[2:00:26] truth as they had it and those elect
[2:00:28] with him in that day will be the ones
[2:00:30] who truly manifest the lord and be his
[2:00:34] body and be his boys and perform his
[2:00:37] works hallelujah do you see it what's he
[2:00:40] saying he's saying you're his hands he's
[2:00:42] saying you're his feet he's saying you
[2:00:43] are to be his voice and you are to
[2:00:45] perform his works oh not me brother

[2:04:57] have need of because you're the final
[2:04:59] voice in this situation
[2:05:02] you have the authority to do so
[2:05:05] hallelujah
[2:05:07] hallelujah
[2:05:11] you speak to your mountain
[2:05:13] let your mountain hear your voice this
[2:05:15] morning
[2:05:18] there is a bride
[2:05:20] i'm gonna go through this part quickly
[2:05:24] and there are many claiming that they
[2:05:25] are that bride
[2:05:27] or that they are part of that bride
[2:05:30] and it's not for me or you to say
[2:05:32] whether they are aren't
[2:05:34] but what i can do is i can look into the
[2:05:36] word
[2:05:37] and i can see what the bride will do
[2:05:40] and what the bride will produce
[2:05:43] and how the bride is to conduct herself
[2:05:46] and then i can make sure that i'm lining
[2:05:48] up to that
[2:05:50] as brother tim put it so perfect last
[2:05:52] week you must line up to the vision
[2:05:55] you can't be part
[2:05:57] of that group that is the final voice to
[2:05:58] the final age and not be matching him
[2:06:00] word for word
[2:06:03] you can't be speaking things contrary to
[2:06:05] the word and be part of the final voice
[2:06:07] your attitude can't be us four and no
[2:06:09] more
[2:06:10] you're not part of the final voice
[2:06:13] you're out of your attitude is to put
[2:06:15] others out because they don't agree with
[2:06:16] you
[2:06:17] you're not part of the final voice
[2:06:20] matter of fact brother brown says now
[2:06:21] isn't that just like the nicolaitans
[2:06:23] that we have with us today
[2:06:25] they curse everyone that don't go their
[2:06:27] way
[2:06:30] when all you know is condemning others
[2:06:32] it shows that you yourself have never
[2:06:33] experienced the grace of god in your own
[2:06:35] life
[2:06:37] listen
[2:06:38] i don't know where people got it twisted
[2:06:41] but this whole message is a message of
[2:06:43] grace
[2:06:45] that's what this message is
[2:06:47] is grace
[2:06:49] brother brown says i believe that we are
[2:06:51] now living in the last day i believe
[2:06:52] that this is the last message this
[2:06:54] message of grace that god has given to
[2:06:56] his church and i believe that any time
[2:06:58] christ could come that's why i'm here
[2:07:00] tonight trying my best to call to every
[2:07:02] side of the world
[2:07:04] and all that i can do to let people see
[2:07:06] that he is true and living god and that
[2:07:09] he is the only door
[2:07:11] people get it so mixed up and they want
[2:07:12] to turn it into a message of judgment
[2:07:15] sure it warns of judgment
[2:07:18] it's a warning of judgment it warns to
[2:07:20] flee from the wrath that is to come it
[2:07:22] warns not to be partakers of the plagues
[2:07:24] but that warning is grace to you
[2:07:27] it is grace to you it comes forth
[2:07:30] shouting grace grace that's what the
[2:07:32] message came to say listen people think
[2:07:34] well boy noah's message was it's going
[2:07:36] to rain noah's message was there's an
[2:07:38] ark
[2:07:41] noah was not a message of judgment it
[2:07:43] was a message of grace
[2:07:45] there's judgment coming but there's
[2:07:47] grace for you there's a door available
[2:07:50] to you
[2:07:51] i've always loved it that when you read
[2:07:53] about the ark it tells very specific
[2:07:55] dimensions about everything
[2:07:57] everything
[2:07:59] but there's no measurements on the size
[2:08:00] of the door
[2:08:02] i got a lot of baggage
[2:08:04] i got a lot of things weighing me down
[2:08:07] i've got doors big enough
[2:08:09] door's big enough you don't understand
[2:08:10] what i've been through in the sin that's
[2:08:12] been doors big enough for you this
[2:08:13] morning and it's open just come on in
[2:08:16] just come on that's what the message is
[2:08:17] is get in the ark get in the ark it's
[2:08:19] not
[2:08:20] if you you're going to burn in hell
[2:08:23] nicolaitans
[2:08:26] the message is get in the ark this
[2:08:28] morning noah's message was a message of
[2:08:30] grace
[2:08:31] brother branham called the messengers
[2:08:32] down to sodom messengers of grace
[2:08:35] and we tend to look at oh they rained
[2:08:37] fire and brim so no they came and
[2:08:38] rescued people before the fire and
[2:08:40] brimstone fail
[2:08:42] this is a message of grace if you're
[2:08:44] preaching that mercy is over you are not
[2:08:46] part of the final voice
[2:08:49] you can't fall in that category and be
[2:08:51] preaching that mercy's over if you
[2:08:53] preach division if you speak against
[2:08:55] your brothers you are not part of the
[2:08:57] final voice
[2:08:59] brother brown says and today the only
[2:09:00] thing that will break down the barriers
[2:09:01] the only thing that can melt us together
[2:09:03] as brothers and christians the only
[2:09:05] thing that could bring us together again
[2:09:06] is the spirit of god or the love of god
[2:09:09] that should have brought in our hearts a
[2:09:11] message of grace from god that we are
[2:09:13] not divided
[2:09:14] all one body are we god heals them just
[2:09:18] the same as
[2:09:19] whatever they are
[2:09:21] we are not
[2:09:22] divided
[2:09:24] well
[2:09:25] brother aaron you don't know this
[2:09:27] doctrine they're preaching over there
[2:09:29] with this over here they're just a
[2:09:30] little different when they came to jesus
[2:09:33] and asked about a situation like that
[2:09:34] one time and he said if they're not
[2:09:35] against us
[2:09:37] they're for us
[2:09:41] if they're not against us they're forced
[2:09:42] how about we focus on
[2:09:45] getting right
[2:09:47] and focus on getting your family right
[2:09:50] and then focus on making sure you're
[2:09:53] being fed right
[2:09:54] and then that doesn't mean i'm not
[2:09:56] worried about others i'm talking about
[2:09:58] worrying about everybody else's problems
[2:09:59] and trying to fix them
[2:10:01] let god deal with them
[2:10:03] if you truly feel like there's an error
[2:10:04] pray for them telling me about it helps
[2:10:06] them none
[2:10:08] it helps them none
[2:10:10] yes judgment is coming
[2:10:12] but there's mercy
[2:10:14] what would the bridegroom be saying i'll
[2:10:16] tell you exactly what he'd be saying
[2:10:18] forgive them
[2:10:20] they know not what they do
[2:10:22] that's exactly what he'd be saying
[2:10:24] listen judgment's coming yet judgment
[2:10:25] was upon the jews it was literally the
[2:10:27] very closing of the jewish dispensation
[2:10:30] judgment was there
[2:10:32] and what was he speaking
[2:10:34] father forgive them
[2:10:35] and so here we are in the closing of the
[2:10:37] gentile dispensation his bride's gonna
[2:10:39] be speaking the same thing not like
[2:10:41] they're gonna burn no father forgive
[2:10:42] them father show them grace father show
[2:10:45] him mercy the same mercy you showed me
[2:10:47] the same grace you showed me the same
[2:10:49] love you showed me bring them in father
[2:10:51] bring them into the heart that's the
[2:10:53] message point them to jesus tell them
[2:10:55] there's mercy tell them there's grace
[2:10:58] if your life is speaking judgment upon
[2:11:00] your brother you're not in the final
[2:11:03] voice
[2:11:04] pointing out their flaws you know some
[2:11:06] people hate
[2:11:07] when a person is looked at highly by a
[2:11:10] group of people and yet they feel like
[2:11:11] they know the real them yeah oh
[2:11:13] everybody likes them but i i know the
[2:11:16] real them
[2:11:17] i know this and it burns them up to see
[2:11:19] somebody respected
[2:11:21] and oh i know this i know this and what
[2:11:23] you are is you find yourself on the side
[2:11:25] of the accuser of the brethren
[2:11:28] and you're not part of the final voice
[2:11:30] to the final age
[2:11:31] the final voice will speak as the groom
[2:11:33] did and offer forgiveness
[2:11:35] and healing because she will match
[2:11:38] him
[2:11:39] you cannot be part of the final voice
[2:11:41] and claim that the days of miracles has
[2:11:43] passed you can't be part of the final
[2:11:44] voice and not see that john 14 12 is for
[2:11:47] this day
[2:11:48] mark 16 in action there are things that
[2:11:51] the finals say in the final voice we'll
[2:11:53] be saying those things are if we lay
[2:11:55] hands on the sick they shall recover if
[2:11:57] we resist the devil he will flee we can
[2:12:00] cast out devils we can tear down satan's
[2:12:02] kingdom you can receive the baptism of
[2:12:04] the holy ghost you can be healed today
[2:12:06] you can be saved today your family can
[2:12:08] be saved that's the final voice that's
[2:12:10] the final say there's grace there's
[2:12:12] mercy bring them in there's salvation
[2:12:14] there's healing there's deliverance
[2:12:16] bring them in
[2:12:18] why do you think that attack is so bad
[2:12:20] against the holy ghost today and the
[2:12:21] movement of the spirit and and the
[2:12:24] and the experience of the holy ghost
[2:12:26] because satan saw
[2:12:28] what it did to the first church age when
[2:12:30] he robbed it from them
[2:12:31] and now for the first time in thousands
[2:12:33] of years he sees another church that
[2:12:35] resembles what he saw back there
[2:12:38] when christians were dangerous
[2:12:40] i'd like to tell him we're back
[2:12:42] i'd like to tell him we're back again
[2:12:45] back then christians were dangerous and
[2:12:47] he wanted to rob him of the power but
[2:12:48] there's another group on the earth today
[2:12:50] that has the same power satan we're back
[2:12:54] we're back on the earth again manifested
[2:12:56] once again he wants to rob that from you
[2:12:58] because he saw how effective it was in
[2:13:00] the first age
[2:13:06] it was the dynamics
[2:13:09] that proved in the groom who he was
[2:13:13] there were a lot of great
[2:13:14] teachers there were a lot of men
[2:13:16] crucified
[2:13:18] but it was the dynamics of the
[2:13:20] resurrection
[2:13:22] that proved who he was
[2:13:24] and it will be the dynamics and the
[2:13:26] bride
[2:13:27] that proves who she is oh come on
[2:13:31] somebody
[2:13:32] the final voice the voice of the groom
[2:13:35] expressed through the bride i'm gonna
[2:13:36] try to start bringing this down listen
[2:13:37] this
[2:13:38] the stumps growed from wesley from
[2:13:40] luther to wesley to pentecost and now is
[2:13:43] honing out those pentecostals and those
[2:13:45] that got the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:13:47] it shall come some day the headstone
[2:13:49] christ jesus in these last days and will
[2:13:51] have to have a ministry just exactly
[2:13:53] like his his whole spirit as it gets
[2:13:55] closer closer closer than negative
[2:13:57] becomes so positive that after a while
[2:13:59] the negative and the positive blends
[2:14:01] together the church in christ to make
[2:14:03] one for we're flesh of his flesh we're
[2:14:06] bone of his bone amen you believe it it
[2:14:08] shall be light in the evening time he
[2:14:10] says but look
[2:14:12] right where that headstone's supposed to
[2:14:14] fit it's honed if they could ever find
[2:14:16] that headstone it would fit just so
[2:14:17] perfectly snug it would bind the whole
[2:14:19] thing together that's the bride of jesus
[2:14:21] christ when the headstone comes there
[2:14:24] will be a church there on earth to
[2:14:25] receive it and it'll have a ministry
[2:14:27] just exactly
[2:14:29] like
[2:14:30] his
[2:14:31] it'll just go right in there bringing up
[2:14:34] the feet
[2:14:35] luther and all the rest of them for the
[2:14:38] resurrection
[2:14:41] somebody's got to step up and play the
[2:14:42] part
[2:14:45] oh y'all trouble now
[2:14:48] i found two more bottles of water
[2:14:54] somebody's got to start stepping up
[2:14:56] playing the part
[2:14:58] it's been seen
[2:14:59] it's been spoken
[2:15:01] and it's only drama now but who's going
[2:15:03] to play the parts
[2:15:05] somebody's going to quit allowing
[2:15:07] they're going to quit allowing their
[2:15:08] flesh to talk them out of it
[2:15:10] somebody's going to quit allowing their
[2:15:12] complexes to talk them out of it look
[2:15:14] we've had enough of flesh speaking it's
[2:15:16] time that the deposit that's on the
[2:15:19] inside overtake the flesh and we allow
[2:15:22] that deposit to begin speaking instead
[2:15:24] of our flesh because that deposit is
[2:15:26] going to agree with the word that
[2:15:28] deposit is going to say what the word
[2:15:29] said because that deposit is just as
[2:15:31] eternal as the word is eternal
[2:15:35] the deposit on the inside of you will
[2:15:37] agree with the word
[2:15:39] listen as we begin to bring this down
[2:15:41] you have not only been given the
[2:15:43] authority to speak
[2:15:45] you have been commanded to speak
[2:15:49] back to our opening verses revelation 10
[2:15:52] 8 and i'm not going to read all of them
[2:15:53] but i'm going to skip through it says go
[2:15:54] and take the little book which is open
[2:15:56] notice we have an open book
[2:15:58] in the hand of the angel we're standing
[2:15:59] upon the scene upon the earth verse 9
[2:16:01] says take it eat it up and it shall make
[2:16:03] thy belly bitter but that shall be in
[2:16:05] thy mouth sweet as honey verse down to
[2:16:07] verse 11 and he said unto me thou must
[2:16:09] prophesy again before many peoples
[2:16:12] nation tongues and kings this is the
[2:16:15] ministry of the bride
[2:16:17] once the book has been opened
[2:16:19] there's the open book there's a group of
[2:16:21] people that have taken it out of the
[2:16:22] hand but now they have something to say
[2:16:25] they have a ministry to speak brother
[2:16:27] branham's asked will the bride have a
[2:16:28] ministry
[2:16:30] he says the bride of christ
[2:16:33] certainly that's what's going on right
[2:16:35] now
[2:16:36] it's the message of the hour the bride
[2:16:38] of christ sure she consists of apostles
[2:16:40] prophets teachers evangelists and
[2:16:42] pastors is that right that's the bride
[2:16:44] of christ sure she's got a ministry
[2:16:46] great ministry it's the ministry of the
[2:16:48] hour and then it'll be so humble
[2:16:51] that's what the final voice
[2:16:53] to the final age is
[2:16:56] the final voice to the final age is the
[2:16:58] ministry of christ repeated in a people
[2:17:01] what was the final voice to the jewish
[2:17:03] dispensation the ministry of christ what
[2:17:05] will be the final voice to the gentile
[2:17:07] dispensation the ministry of christ what
[2:17:10] he did she will do what he conquered we
[2:17:13] will conquer
[2:17:14] where he overcame we will overcame and
[2:17:16] where he resurrected we have over we
[2:17:19] have resurrected i listen a lot this
[2:17:21] week who is the rising of the sun and
[2:17:22] brother brown would say what a
[2:17:23] resurrection that was but what a
[2:17:26] resurrection this is
[2:17:29] here we are listen he says he proved
[2:17:31] what he was and this is back to it was
[2:17:33] the dynamics that proved
[2:17:35] who the groom was and it'll be the
[2:17:37] dynamics that prove who the bride is he
[2:17:39] says he proved what he was anyone could
[2:17:41] die but it take god to raise again in
[2:17:44] his life he looked like god he preached
[2:17:46] like god he healed like god he acted
[2:17:48] like god he was god and he proved on
[2:17:51] easter morning that he was god he was
[2:17:53] more than a man he wasn't a prophet yet
[2:17:54] he was a prophet he was a good man but
[2:17:57] yet he was more than a good man he was
[2:17:59] god and so this
[2:18:01] is the day in memorial of his
[2:18:03] resurrection that he proved it
[2:18:06] when he was here on earth there never
[2:18:08] was a birth like his there never was a
[2:18:10] death like his and there never was
[2:18:11] nobody raised from the dead like that he
[2:18:14] proved what he was when he was here on
[2:18:16] earth he said he was god he acted like
[2:18:18] god he preached like god he healed like
[2:18:21] god he rose from the dead like god he
[2:18:23] proved he was god he was more than a
[2:18:25] philosopher he was more than a teacher
[2:18:27] he was more than a scholar he was more
[2:18:29] than a prophet he was god that's who he
[2:18:32] was
[2:18:33] and it was the resurrection that proved
[2:18:36] he was god it was the dynamics that
[2:18:38] proved he was god it wasn't just the
[2:18:40] teaching it wasn't just his doctrine it
[2:18:42] was the dynamics of resurrection power
[2:18:45] that proved he was almighty god it was
[2:18:48] the dynamics that caused him to
[2:18:50] resurrect
[2:18:51] it was the dynamics
[2:18:53] he said it won't just move no matter how
[2:18:55] good the mechanics is until the dynamics
[2:18:58] come when the dynamics come that fire is
[2:19:00] made to connect with the octane and the
[2:19:02] gasoline and when that explodes it
[2:19:04] causes a combustion
[2:19:06] and that combustion moves every motion
[2:19:09] and every move for he is the same
[2:19:10] yesterday today and forever that's the
[2:19:13] resurrection
[2:19:15] that's the real power of god mechanics
[2:19:17] with dynamics the gasoline represents
[2:19:20] the word it's the truth but without the
[2:19:22] spirit it won't move we have put too
[2:19:24] much stress on the mechanics not in
[2:19:26] nothing on the dynamics it needs the
[2:19:28] dynamic power of god the resurrection
[2:19:31] power of jesus christ upon the church to
[2:19:34] manifest and to bring to pass this is
[2:19:37] gasoline
[2:19:38] it might be a gasoline can but it could
[2:19:40] still be water but the only proof of it
[2:19:43] is put some life on it and it'll prove
[2:19:46] whether it's gasoline or not
[2:19:48] come on church here we are it was the
[2:19:50] dynamics that proved whether or not he
[2:19:52] was the groom and it'll be the dynamics
[2:19:54] that'll prove whether or not you're the
[2:19:56] bride just as the dynamic power of the
[2:19:59] resurrection proved he was so will it
[2:20:01] prove who she is
[2:20:04] oh come on not just the correct
[2:20:06] doctrines which we have but the dynamic
[2:20:08] power of the resurrection working in our
[2:20:11] midst
[2:20:12] healing the sick saving the lost filling
[2:20:14] people with the holy ghost
[2:20:16] and all of it happening through each and
[2:20:18] every one of you
[2:20:20] his bride
[2:20:21] the manifestation of the word once again
[2:20:23] here upon the earth
[2:20:25] look satan
[2:20:27] i don't think you know who you're
[2:20:28] messing with this just isn't some other
[2:20:31] denominational church fly by night
[2:20:33] that's going to lay down and quit but
[2:20:34] this is a church scene in the vision
[2:20:36] this is a church who is in the thoughts
[2:20:38] of almighty god this is a people that
[2:20:40] are born of his bone flesh of his flesh
[2:20:42] and even as he thwarted you every time
[2:20:44] he came in contact with you so will she
[2:20:46] we will overcome you
[2:20:48] in your own layout to see you in your
[2:20:50] own eden
[2:20:52] all of it happening right now and his
[2:20:54] bride
[2:20:55] what a match
[2:20:57] what a match
[2:20:59] doing his works
[2:21:01] speaking his word
[2:21:02] the lord jesus
[2:21:04] manifested in a bright body
[2:21:08] armed and dangerous
[2:21:11] the final voice
[2:21:12] and abroad
[2:21:14] declaring he is the same yesterday
[2:21:17] today
[2:21:18] and forever
[2:21:20] dynamic power
[2:21:21] proving once again that he lives
[2:21:28] i thought about that and i was looking
[2:21:29] at that i said it was dynamic power that
[2:21:31] resurrected the lord jesus from the
[2:21:33] grave it was dynamic power that morning
[2:21:35] that proved that he was the groom
[2:21:38] because he raised from the grave and
[2:21:39] it's going to be dynamic power one of
[2:21:41] these mornings that takes us in a
[2:21:42] rapture and proves who we are you talk
[2:21:45] about a proven you talk about a final
[2:21:46] say i say let them mock let them make
[2:21:49] fun let them ridicule let them say this
[2:21:51] there's going to be a final say coming
[2:21:52] one of these mornings it's going to be
[2:21:54] dynamic power it's going to be dynamo in
[2:21:56] the bride of jesus christ the same power
[2:21:58] that raised him out of the grave is
[2:22:00] going to take you up off the earth
[2:22:02] the final say
[2:22:04] wraps your day
[2:22:11] those in the bride will do only his will
[2:22:14] no one can make them do otherwise
[2:22:16] they have thus saith the lord or they
[2:22:18] keep still
[2:22:19] they know that it has to be god in them
[2:22:21] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[2:22:23] he did not complete now listen to this
[2:22:27] here's the point i've been wanting to
[2:22:28] get to
[2:22:31] he did not complete all his work while
[2:22:33] in his earthly ministry
[2:22:35] so now he works in and through his bride
[2:22:38] she knows that
[2:22:40] for it was not yet time for him to do
[2:22:42] certain things that he must now do but
[2:22:45] he will now fulfill through the bride
[2:22:47] that work which he left for this
[2:22:50] specific time
[2:22:52] we got some conquering to do
[2:22:54] we got some devils to defeat we got some
[2:22:56] overcoming to do we got blind eyes to
[2:22:58] come open we got loved ones that we're
[2:23:00] gonna call back we got some healings and
[2:23:02] deliverances even in this service that
[2:23:03] we got to do because it's his work
[2:23:05] working through us it's his bride
[2:23:08] manifested in the flesh
[2:23:10] so much so how much
[2:23:12] resurrection power is going to be in
[2:23:14] that bride
[2:23:15] how much
[2:23:18] so much so
[2:23:19] that you will call for the general
[2:23:22] resurrection
[2:23:26] will that power in him cause the first
[2:23:28] resurrection
[2:23:29] what's the power in you gonna cost
[2:23:32] that resurrection brother branham says
[2:23:35] say to this mountain and you've heard
[2:23:37] about what's been taking place that's
[2:23:38] the ministry that we're entering into we
[2:23:41] we're way up the road now soon the
[2:23:42] coming of the lord jesus and we've got
[2:23:44] to have rapturing faith in a church that
[2:23:45] can be changed in a moment a twinkly of
[2:23:47] an eye or will not go but don't worry
[2:23:50] don't worry
[2:23:52] i know what plans i have
[2:23:53] don't worry it'll be there it'll be
[2:23:56] there and when the power of this church
[2:23:58] rises it'll bring its brethren and the
[2:24:00] power of that church rises will bring us
[2:24:02] with the power of this church when it
[2:24:04] rises to the place it's supposed to be
[2:24:06] it's going to bring its brethren and the
[2:24:07] power of that church will bring the
[2:24:09] other brethren then there'll be a
[2:24:10] general resurrection
[2:24:12] we're looking forward to it
[2:24:14] the voice of god
[2:24:16] so strong in a people that is calling
[2:24:19] for a resurrection
[2:24:21] the voice of god it's a group of people
[2:24:23] that's calling for resurrection power to
[2:24:26] operate within them lord i need that
[2:24:28] power today and it's what we need each
[2:24:30] day and i'm calling for and i need it
[2:24:31] tomorrow and this one's calling for it
[2:24:33] and this one's calling for it and you're
[2:24:34] calling for resurrection power and i
[2:24:36] need it in this situation and i need it
[2:24:38] in that situation and then it's a life
[2:24:39] so close a life that's so full of the
[2:24:42] power of the resurrection and there's
[2:24:43] thousands of these lives thousands of
[2:24:45] them calling for it i need resurrection
[2:24:47] power brother joe you need resurrection
[2:24:49] power and you're calling for it and i'm
[2:24:51] calling for it and thousands of lies
[2:24:53] calling for resurrection power and he's
[2:24:55] calling her and she's calling him and
[2:24:57] there's a drawing and up from the ground

[2:25:08] i'm calling him and up from the ground
[2:25:10] they're gonna come
[2:25:12] i say it's a perfect match because when
[2:25:14] my groom stood there at the grave of
[2:25:17] lazarus
[2:25:18] brother brown said had he not called him
[2:25:20] by name
[2:25:21] it would have called the general
[2:25:22] resurrection but it wasn't time yet
[2:25:27] but it is now
[2:25:29] a group of people i say call it
[2:25:32] i say call it

[2:25:42] he begins to call you and begins to draw
[2:25:44] you that same power is going to draw the
[2:25:46] dead in christ right up out of the grave
[2:25:49] are you ready to be that people are you
[2:25:51] ready to be that people this morning
[2:25:52] where you stand with me stay with me is
[2:25:54] there somebody here that will give him
[2:25:55] praise today and say lord i'm ready to
[2:25:57] be that people i'm ready to be the
[2:25:58] manifestation of the word i'm ready for
[2:26:01] you to speak through my life i'm ready
[2:26:02] to do your works lord i see in the word

[2:26:08] power that's supposed to be there and i
[2:26:09] want that i'm calling for that
[2:26:11] resurrection power i'm calling to you
[2:26:13] lord if i don't got it fill me i need
[2:26:15] more of it and when there's enough lies

[2:26:19] to pull him down out of glory and he
[2:26:21] begins to pull her up off this earth the
[2:26:24] resurrection is going to take place
[2:26:26] the dead in christ
[2:26:27] so when this corruptable shall put on
[2:26:30] incorruption and this mortal shall put
[2:26:32] on immortality then shall be brought to
[2:26:35] pass the saying that is written death
[2:26:37] is swallowed up in victory
[2:26:40] death
[2:26:41] swollen up in victory what is that jesus
[2:26:43] conquered that no no death took jesus
[2:26:45] took the stinger from death
[2:26:48] but it's his bride
[2:26:50] that never tastes death whatsoever
[2:26:53] and death is swallowed up in victory
[2:26:56] what a promise what a word what a people
[2:26:59] and i say she's standing on the earth
[2:27:01] today doing the works of god ready to
[2:27:03] say death you are swallowed up
[2:27:07] in victory
[2:27:08] the final say
[2:27:10] in the final voice
[2:27:12] the same power in the bride i ask you
[2:27:15] today what will you speak

[2:27:18] will you speak
[2:27:20] amen will you bow your heads with me
[2:27:22] father
[2:27:24] lord you promised that if the same
[2:27:25] spirit
[2:27:26] had raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[2:27:28] in us it would quicken also our mortal
[2:27:31] bodies
[2:27:32] lord i want to be diligent
[2:27:35] lord i want to match you
[2:27:37] or we can't be pretending
[2:27:40] can't be pretending when it comes time
[2:27:41] for a resurrection
[2:27:43] can't be pretending when it comes time
[2:27:44] for a rapture
[2:27:46] lord i know you wasn't pretending that
[2:27:47] day at the grave of lazarus
[2:27:49] lord you wasn't pretending that day at
[2:27:51] calvary you wasn't pretending when you
[2:27:53] went down to hell
[2:27:54] oh and you wasn't pretending when you
[2:27:56] resurrected lord i don't want to be a
[2:27:58] pretender
[2:27:59] but lord let me be diligent
[2:28:02] lord let me be diligent there's got to
[2:28:04] be a people tearing satan's kingdom down
[2:28:06] lord i want to match that
[2:28:08] lord the closing words of the jewish
[2:28:10] dispensation you cried out it is
[2:28:12] finished
[2:28:15] and i believe it is finished we'll close
[2:28:16] out this one
[2:28:18] as satan's kingdom is completely
[2:28:20] destroyed
[2:28:21] by a bride who has thus saith the lord
[2:28:24] and we know what you want done with it
[2:28:26] lord help us all to come to that place
[2:28:28] lord we're all at different places along
[2:28:30] the walk
[2:28:31] but lord once again i want a crowd
[2:28:33] there's mercy and there's grace
[2:28:35] there's salvation and there's healing
[2:28:38] lord i want to match you and what you
[2:28:39] cry and what you're saying
[2:28:42] i want to match you so perfectly lord
[2:28:44] that you give me the authority to speak
[2:28:46] in your name
[2:28:48] lord how we love you and how we thank
[2:28:49] you and how we believe lord god that
[2:28:51] you're coming so soon
[2:28:54] lord i ask for each heart gathered here
[2:28:55] if there's one that doesn't know you
[2:28:56] lord may you draw nigh to them now
[2:28:59] lord and each and every one of us i have
[2:29:01] a relationship with you lord may we take
[2:29:02] another step and draw another step
[2:29:04] closer i pray
[2:29:05] in jesus
[2:29:06] name
[2:29:08] hey man do you love him
[2:29:12] before i leave i want to read you this
[2:29:13] quote
[2:29:16] it is finished
[2:29:18] there is now therefore no condemnation
[2:29:20] why should the church fear what promises
[2:29:23] has he ever failed to manifest before us
[2:29:25] why should it fear punishment or death
[2:29:28] it has all been overcome
[2:29:29] here is the mighty conqueror here is the
[2:29:31] one who conquered both worlds of the
[2:29:33] scene and the unseen not like alexander
[2:29:36] who conquered the world at the age of 33
[2:29:38] and knew no other way to turn for
[2:29:39] further conquest so he died a victim of
[2:29:42] sin and righteous living not like
[2:29:44] napoleon who conquered all europe but
[2:29:46] finally was defeated at waterloo and
[2:29:48] banished to elba only to find himself
[2:29:50] conquered but nothing could conquer
[2:29:52] christ he that descended has now
[2:29:54] ascended above all and unto him has been
[2:29:57] given a name that is above every name
[2:29:59] yes he conquered death hell in the grave
[2:30:01] and has the keys thereof what he looses
[2:30:04] is loosed and what he binds is bound
[2:30:06] there is no changing of it there was no
[2:30:08] conqueror before him and there is none
[2:30:10] beside him he alone is the savior
[2:30:12] redeemer he is the only god and the lord
[2:30:15] jesus christ is his name
[2:30:17] all my
[2:30:18] power is yours my omnipotence is yours
[2:30:22] as i stand in your midst i have not come
[2:30:24] to bring fear and failure but love and
[2:30:27] courage and ability all power is given
[2:30:30] unto me and it is yours to use
[2:30:33] so you speak the word and i will perform
[2:30:36] it that is my covenant
[2:30:38] and it can never fail
[2:30:40] the final say
[2:30:42] and the final voice
[2:30:43] god bless you church amen
[2:30:46] [Applause]
[2:31:00] fall just like the rain
