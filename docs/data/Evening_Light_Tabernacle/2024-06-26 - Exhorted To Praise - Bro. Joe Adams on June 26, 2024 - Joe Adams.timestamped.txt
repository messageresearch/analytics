[35:56] one well to see e was kind of upside
[35:58] down if we were going to have church or
[35:59] not but it's good to see some of you
[36:02] made
[36:03] it ier one was about to climb back into
[36:05] the bed I've had an allergic reaction
[36:07] today and my eye my right eye was shut
[36:09] pretty much most of the day and so I
[36:11] climbed in the bed and said well I'll
[36:13] just sleep this thing off and then when
[36:15] they said there was no church I was like
[36:16] oh praise
[36:18] God I can sleep this thing off and then
[36:20] about 4:45 we're having church and I'm
[36:23] like uhoh I got to get upstairs and
[36:24] study so but we're prepared tonight we I
[36:27] want to speak to you by the grace of God
[36:29] on some things of the scripture we look
[36:32] here in Psalms 95 and verse one it says
[36:33] oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us
[36:36] Make a Joyful Noise into the Rock of our
[36:39] Salvation let us come before his
[36:41] presence with Thanksgiving that word
[36:43] there means praise and Make a Joyful
[36:45] Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord
[36:48] is a great God and a great king above
[36:50] all gods in his hands are the Deep
[36:53] places of the Earth the strength of the
[36:55] hills is his also the sea is his and he
[36:59] made it and His Hands formed the dry
[37:00] land oh come let us worship and bow down
[37:04] let us kneel before the Lord our maker
[37:06] for he is our God and we are the people
[37:08] of his Pastor the Sheep of his hand then
[37:12] we look here in Psalms 107 and verse
[37:19] 31 oh that men would praise the Lord for
[37:23] his goodness and for his wonderful Works
[37:26] to the Children of Men Men Let Them
[37:28] exalt him also in the congregation of
[37:31] the people and praise him in the
[37:33] Assembly of the elders all right one
[37:36] last scripture reading this evening for
[37:37] you you can have your seats Psalms 18
[37:39] and verse
[37:41] two Psalms 18 and verse
[37:45] two the Lord is my rock and my Fortress
[37:49] my deliverer my God my strength in whom
[37:53] I will trust my Buckler and the Horn of
[37:57] my Sal ation and my high tower I will
[38:01] call upon the Lord who is worthy to be
[38:05] praised God bless you you can have your
[38:07] seats this evening so the last time I
[38:10] spoke I spoke on created for worship and
[38:13] we discussed there how praise was alog
[38:16] together different than worship and
[38:19] tonight I want to speak to you on
[38:21] exhorted to praise so I don't want you
[38:23] to think that we're not meant to praise
[38:26] God but praise is actually an essential
[38:29] aspect of your worship because you
[38:31] cannot truly worship God but what you
[38:34] don't praise him because if your heart
[38:36] is full of worship and your heart is
[38:38] full of love and full of Thanksgiving
[38:40] for what God has done for you then your
[38:42] mouth with your mouth with your hands
[38:44] with your feet with your life you will
[38:46] begin to praise God and give him thanks
[38:49] for what he has done for you so we're
[38:51] going to speak on exhorted to praise and
[38:53] this word exhort here means to strongly
[38:55] encourage it means to to urge someone to
[38:58] do something to persuade through Earnest
[39:01] appeals and in Psalms 18 and verse3 says
[39:05] I will call upon the Lord who is worthy
[39:08] to be praised and that word praiser
[39:11] means to boast about it means to act
[39:14] foolish over it means to Rave to
[39:17] celebrate to Fain self to act madly to
[39:21] act like a mad
[39:24] man all right now people want to say you
[39:28] can't act this way but that's what the
[39:30] word means in the Greek and here we find
[39:34] that in this day we pray so many things
[39:38] as I said last time we give out
[39:40] participation trophies because we don't
[39:41] want the little fat chunky kid on the
[39:43] bench getting his feelings hurt cuz he
[39:45] didn't touch the field CU he's not good
[39:47] enough back in my day I was that fat
[39:49] chunky kid I didn't get a trophy for
[39:51] just being on the
[39:53] team but you had a perform but today we
[39:56] praise everything in everybody you find
[39:58] today people will go to sporting events
[40:01] this past year there was an event it was
[40:03] one of the playoff games in the football
[40:04] and I think the temperatures were in the
[40:06] negatives and the wind chill was e even
[40:08] in the high negatives and fans sat out
[40:10] there and they screamed for three or
[40:12] four hours and they spent no telling how
[40:14] much money to get into the game and no
[40:16] telling how much more money to get drunk
[40:18] and to eat and do all this other stuff
[40:20] they were act like Mad Men screaming and
[40:23] shouting and praising their team and and
[40:26] rooting on their favorite player and the
[40:28] team didn't know where they were sitting
[40:30] the player didn't know where they were
[40:31] sitting and yet we come into the house
[40:33] of God on a Wednesday night on a Sunday
[40:36] morning and we spend two or three hours
[40:38] and we sing praises to our God we clap
[40:41] our hands we lift up our hands and we
[40:43] worship Our God and that they want to
[40:45] call us crazy because we spend a couple
[40:48] hours and maybe we get moved by the
[40:50] spirit but yet I'm here to praise a God
[40:52] that knows where I'm sitting I'm here to
[40:54] praise a God that knows that I'm in the
[40:56] house of God I'm in a praise of God that
[40:59] knows my struggles I knows my name he
[41:01] knows where I come from and he knows
[41:03] where I'm
[41:05] going and he's worthy to be praised
[41:08] tonight he and he alone is worthy to be
[41:11] praised and I love what the Bible says
[41:13] in Psalms 10731 oh that men would praise
[41:17] the Lord for his goodness notice it
[41:19] ain't based on your goodness it's not
[41:21] based on our Merit it ain't based on how
[41:24] you feel how what what kind of Christian
[41:26] you were to today but you praise God for
[41:29] his goodness and his
[41:32] Mercy some of us need to realize you was
[41:34] a sinner headed for hell you got a right
[41:37] to praise God some of you were drunk
[41:40] some of you were drug addicts some of
[41:42] you were prostitutes or you live that
[41:44] kind of dirty life but yet now God
[41:46] turned your life around and I'm here to
[41:48] tell you he's worthy to be praised
[41:54] tonight brother says now men are always
[41:57] praise God for what he's
[41:59] done they look forward to what he's
[42:02] going to do and they ignore what he's
[42:06] doing right
[42:07] now let's just bring that home you know
[42:10] I understand we can look back and we
[42:12] should be able to praise God for what
[42:13] he's done look at eite Tabernacle look
[42:17] at what God has done in our church how
[42:19] he's delivered how he set the captive
[42:20] free How He restored her to Mariah puit
[42:23] how he healed sister Lana sister Sharon
[42:26] sister Ruth s Genie from cancer How He
[42:28] restored the failing eyes from Brother
[42:30] David Dexter look we we we we recognize
[42:33] that and we praise God for that but
[42:36] don't miss what he's doing
[42:38] tonight don't miss that he's here
[42:40] tonight you say what do you mean brother
[42:42] Joe I mean this very evening right now
[42:44] God is still moving some of you parents
[42:46] that are praying for those way were
[42:48] loved ones you have a right tonight you
[42:50] can begin to praise God before they may
[42:52] take the first step back into the house
[42:54] of God you say why brother cuz you have
[42:57] a
[42:59] promise you have a promise you can
[43:01] praise God you have a promise right now
[43:03] you some of you are sick in body you can
[43:05] praise God in your sickness because you
[43:07] have a promise that he's a Healer some
[43:10] of you in a very awful trial and you can
[43:12] praise God right now because he said
[43:15] I'll never leave you I'll never forsake
[43:17] you but I'll be with you even in
[43:20] you God's walking through that trial
[43:22] with
[43:23] you you should praise him some you've
[43:27] been tormented by your past praise him
[43:30] because you got a
[43:32] future praise him because you got a
[43:35] present I love what the Bible says in
[43:38] Revelations 5 and that's to me is
[43:39] probably one of my most favorite
[43:41] chapters in all the Bible because here
[43:43] we find that there was no man found
[43:46] worthy to take a book but this just
[43:49] wasn't any book this was a special book
[43:51] brother it was the book of the
[43:53] redeemed and yet there was no man found
[43:56] worthy and yet we find that the Lamb of
[43:58] God stepped out from around the throne
[44:00] and he took the book he didn't just take
[44:04] the book but he did something with the
[44:06] book let me tell you he took the seals
[44:08] off the book and he opened the book up
[44:11] and here John was John begin to weep cuz
[44:14] no man was found worthy no Pastor was
[44:17] found worthy no preacher was found
[44:19] worthy no Prophet was found worthy no
[44:21] pop was found worthy but a worthy lamb
[44:24] stepped out around the throne and he
[44:26] took possession the title deed he took
[44:28] possession of the
[44:30] book and what did he do he ripped the
[44:32] seals off of it and when he ripped the
[44:34] seals off John could see his name there
[44:37] oh come on John can you see your name in
[44:39] the book of the
[44:41] redeemed oh you may have lived a dirty
[44:43] life but in your at your at the very
[44:45] beginning your name was written in the
[44:47] Lamb's Book of
[44:49] Life you have a right to praise God
[44:52] we're not receiving Revelation from a
[44:54] closed
[44:56] book come on Church we're not receiving
[44:58] Revelation from a closed book the days
[45:00] of probing is over all the loose sins
[45:03] have been tied together the seals have
[45:06] been torn off and now the Bible has
[45:08] become a new
[45:10] book The Lamb took it he open and he
[45:13] showed John who he was and I believe we
[45:16] have a right tonight because some of us
[45:19] have seen your
[45:21] name that you were part of the Plan of
[45:23] Redemption the entire time that
[45:25] everything God did every message he ever
[45:27] sent every preacher that he ever put
[45:29] here was for the purpose of getting you
[45:32] to realize your name is in this
[45:35] book and you say well why should I
[45:37] praise God because God is worthy of your
[45:41] praise John 4:23 brother Tim read it
[45:46] again this past Sunday he said but the
[45:47] hour cometh and now is when the true
[45:50] worshippers shall worship the father in
[45:53] spirit and in truth for the father
[45:56] seeketh such to worship worship him
[45:59] that's what he's wanting worshippers
[46:01] those that are not afraid to praise
[46:04] God those that are not afraid to act
[46:06] like Mad Men oh I've seen some of you
[46:09] watch a football game I watched it with
[46:11] you so I know what you're capable of
[46:14] tonight don't tell me it's not my nature
[46:16] oh yeah when it's your team it's your
[46:18] nature well whose team are we on tonight
[46:22] it should be our nature if he's our
[46:23] heavenly father and we're running for
[46:25] him and he's done everything thing for
[46:27] us all we got to do is go behind him
[46:29] he's worthy to be praised he's worthy to
[46:32] be exhorted tonight to be exalted and
[46:35] lifted up you know the most most
[46:39] frequent frequently repeated command in
[46:42] all of the scriptures is a command to
[46:44] praise the
[46:47] Lord the command to praise the
[46:51] Lord cuz sometimes you got to make
[46:53] yourself
[46:54] prais cuz all you're thinking about is
[46:57] problems all are you thinking about is
[46:59] your situation all do you think about is
[47:01] that depression and that anxiety and
[47:03] that this and that sickness and that but
[47:05] you are being commanded to
[47:08] praise God recognizes you got a problem
[47:11] he recognizes you're sick and body he
[47:13] recognizes you're in a trial but he
[47:14] don't want you to praise your trial
[47:16] praise your sickness praise your trouble
[47:17] praise
[47:19] him we should praise the Lord because he
[47:22] created us for
[47:25] such so you maybe you wonder well why am
[47:28] I here brother Joe why am I here tonight
[47:30] God's got a purpose for you and that
[47:31] purpose is when you praise God you're
[47:33] fulfilling your purpose
[47:36] yes as I said last time Angels were
[47:39] created to worship God but they couldn't
[47:42] give God what you can give
[47:44] God so you can give God a praise
[47:47] sacrifice offering from a voluntary
[47:49] worship you're not manufactured or made
[47:52] to do it but you're you're a free moral
[47:55] agent and it comes out of you
[47:58] so we find here that the Bible tells us
[48:00] when you praise the Lord it brings his
[48:04] presence close to us it brings his glory
[48:07] down in Psalms 22 and verse3 if you turn
[48:10] there we're going to look at this just
[48:11] for this
[48:12] evening Psalms 22 and verse3 says but
[48:15] Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabits the
[48:19] Praises of Israel so God inhabits the
[48:23] Praises of Israel God inhabits the
[48:26] praise of evening light
[48:28] Tabernacle well I just don't feel like
[48:30] praising God tonight God inhabits your
[48:34] praise come on some of you can tell your
[48:37] little depression story over and over
[48:39] and over and over and over till people
[48:41] are sick of it but what about praising
[48:43] the god the creator of heavens and earth
[48:46] tonight he inhabit your praise and that
[48:50] word inhabit mean he comes to to abide
[48:53] there he comes to dwell he draws nigh
[48:56] when you begin to lift up his name when
[48:58] you begin to lift up his goodness when
[49:00] you begin to thank him for his healing
[49:02] when you begin to thank him for his
[49:04] Deliverance when you begin to thank him
[49:05] for that wavered son when you begin to
[49:07] thank him for that wavered husband he
[49:09] draws now on the scene church he had
[49:12] have the praise of his
[49:16] people you can have the worst day of
[49:19] your life and I'm sure some of us have
[49:21] had it
[49:22] today but you go to praising God
[49:26] the atmosphere all of a sudden
[49:29] changes if I could just get you to enter
[49:31] in
[49:32] tonight the atmosphere and even the
[49:34] light of change go to praise him for
[49:36] watching over your life go to praise him
[49:39] for watching over that seed that
[49:41] predestinated Seed where he put this one
[49:44] with that one and that one with that one
[49:46] and it went through this war and this
[49:47] famine and this sickness and all that
[49:49] and brought you to where you are today
[49:52] go to praising God before putting food
[49:54] on your table today go to praising God
[49:56] from turning your heart from unbelief to
[49:58] believing go to praising God for what
[50:01] for taking you out of a life of sin for
[50:03] sending you a message for healing your
[50:06] body for filling you with the Holy Ghost
[50:08] for giving you a good church to attend
[50:10] for giving you a pastor in a faithful
[50:12] Ministry we got a right to praise God
[50:15] you say brother can't find anything to
[50:17] praise God about if you turn your eyes
[50:19] from the negative and start worshiping
[50:21] the positive and start thanking God for
[50:23] what he's done for you you got all kind
[50:25] of reasons to praise
[50:27] [Applause]
[50:29] him let me get a little bit more volume
[50:32] up here it's not working on my part if
[50:33] you don't mind see praise
[50:37] him instead of finding reasons not to
[50:39] praise God let's see why we should
[50:43] praise
[50:47] God and when you find those reasons to
[50:50] praise him and go to praising him he
[50:52] draws nigh
[50:53] yes that means when you begin to talk
[50:56] about God
[50:58] when you begin to extol him and lift up
[51:01] his name and give him the honor that he
[51:05] deserves he
[51:07] comes he
[51:09] comes and the atmosphere
[51:12] changes brother Timothy I believe you
[51:14] told me a testimony today of how you
[51:16] begin to talk about God and a young
[51:19] man had his moment brother Timothy LED
[51:22] this young man to the Lord this weekend
[51:24] in a moment because the name ofes Jesus
[51:26] was being lifted up he was being
[51:29] elevated and the young man gave his
[51:32] heart to God so we find if you'll just
[51:35] extol God for who he is he'll come on
[51:38] the scene he draws n he draws close to
[51:41] you that'll begin to praise him he comes
[51:44] to where he's
[51:47] invited is that okay he comes where he's
[51:50] invited you begin to talk about God he
[51:52] will show up brother B tells us in when
[51:54] their eyes were open they knew him he
[51:56] said they were talking about him when he
[51:58] appeared this is speaking of Copus and
[52:00] his friend on the road to d uh Damascus
[52:02] not Damascus wherever they were going to
[52:04] M us they were they were walking thank
[52:08] God we got Vehicles today Long Walk yeah
[52:11] he said notice now that's a good thing
[52:13] we notice here in the scripture and
[52:15] while they talked of him while they
[52:17] spoke of the things going along talking
[52:20] about him said when they found out he
[52:25] appeared when when he appeared he
[52:27] appeared unto them while they were going
[52:29] along reasoning reasoning about him
[52:32] that's when he always appears when we
[52:35] talk about him always through the
[52:37] scripture it's when the people talk
[52:39] about God that's when he appears he says
[52:43] Bo but we're too busy talking about
[52:45] other things uhoh he says think he goes
[52:49] I think that's the reason many people
[52:51] who love him fail to see him many people
[52:55] who love him failed to see him we're so
[52:59] busy with our Creeds and our
[53:02] denominations and the business about the
[53:04] churches and memberships getting more
[53:06] members and things we're too busy to
[53:07] talk about him he's the word we're too
[53:11] interested in some Creed some textbook
[53:13] something else how many members can we
[53:15] get both them in shall we take this one
[53:18] that one the other one he says we should
[53:20] constantly be giving ourselves to the
[53:23] word and God In Prayer but we're too
[53:26] busy talking about all this frivilous
[53:28] stuff that doesn't make a difference and
[53:31] I
[53:32] wonder yeah I got a little feedback up
[53:34] here I wonder today if we're not too
[53:37] busy arguing about doctrinal points in
[53:39] the
[53:40] message that we can't give God
[53:43] praise worried about who's right who's
[53:45] not right worried about if we can have
[53:47] emotion if we shouldn't have emotion
[53:48] wondered about if we can speak in
[53:49] tongues and we can't speak in tongues if
[53:51] we can have a moveing of the spirit if
[53:52] we can't have a moving of the spirit I
[53:54] wonder we got so caught up in all that
[53:56] that we forget to give him
[53:59] praise he's not worried about if you got
[54:01] a motion if you don't have a motion
[54:03] because if you don't you're dead but
[54:04] that's beside the point if you want to
[54:05] speak in tongues or don't speak in
[54:07] tongues if you if you want to run around
[54:08] the church don't run around God just
[54:11] want your
[54:12] praise he said well brother Jo I don't
[54:14] know if it's in my nature I don't know
[54:15] if I can do that I don't know if it's
[54:17] right or not I tell you what put all
[54:18] that other stuff aside and you just go
[54:20] to praising God you go to thanking God
[54:22] for what he's done for you you go to
[54:24] thanking God for what he's going to do
[54:25] for you you go to thanking God he'll
[54:27] draw not you may speak in another tongue
[54:29] he'll draw not you may run around the
[54:31] church he'll come close to you and you
[54:33] may be an interpretation it may do
[54:35] whatever God wants to do you just
[54:38] worship Him you just give him praise you
[54:40] just exalt his name and you let the Holy
[54:43] Ghost do the rest that's right quit
[54:45] trying to figure it all out and put God
[54:47] in some
[54:50] box he don't belong in a message
[54:55] box he belongs on our lips on our hands
[54:58] and our feet in a worship of adoration
[55:01] and
[55:03] praise notice brother the scripture
[55:05] tells us that cleopas and his friend
[55:07] they were down in their Spirits they had
[55:10] a bad day brother
[55:13] Aaron and we find here then he said this
[55:16] is in Luke 24 verse 25 he said unto them
[55:18] oh fools and slow of heart to believe
[55:21] all that the prophets has spoken what
[55:23] not Christ have suffer these things and
[55:25] to enter into his his glory and
[55:27] beginning at Moses and all the prophets
[55:30] he expounded unto them all the
[55:32] scriptures the things concerning of
[55:35] himself brother B says these people were
[55:38] sad they were talking a great thing had
[55:40] happened and he would have been taken
[55:42] away but they were talking about him and
[55:45] there he
[55:46] appeared so let's get our minds off of
[55:49] what this church is doing and what this
[55:50] brother's doing and what this one's
[55:52] doing and just put our focus on
[55:55] him every church is Sovereign in itself
[55:57] we're not worried about how they're run
[55:59] you don't need to go seek some uh
[56:01] guidance from some other Pastor you got
[56:03] a pastor you don't need to be worrying
[56:04] about all that you got a church home
[56:06] right
[56:08] here support the church have confidence
[56:10] in the ministry have confidence in your
[56:12] pastor have confidence in the shepherd
[56:14] this do I need to grab a handheld
[56:30] Welly we were having trouble we didn't
[56:31] want church and we did want church and
[56:33] now the mic is messing up and my voice
[56:35] is struggling but somebody's going to
[56:37] praise him anyway can we just set all
[56:39] that aside and just praise him
[56:43] tonight
[56:45] Hallelujah but notice they were sad but
[56:47] when they begin to talk about God and
[56:49] you may be sad today you may have had a
[56:51] hard day but let's just worship him
[56:53] let's just set it all aside and give God
[56:55] praise and all of a sudden things begin
[56:58] to change and the word came personally
[57:00] in flesh and begin to expound the
[57:03] scriptures from the beginning to the end
[57:05] he be to reveal to them who he was and
[57:08] the Bible says that he would have went
[57:10] straight on from them but something they
[57:12] constrained them oh Hallelujah they
[57:15] begin to constrain the word to come the
[57:18] day was Far spent let me tell you even
[57:20] like Tabernacle we're at the end time
[57:22] there ain't much time left and the
[57:24] daylight is CL it's falling the end is
[57:26] coming and there's going to be a people
[57:28] in the land that'll constrain him oh

[57:33] revealed to me who I was you showed me
[57:35] who you were in the scriptures I want to
[57:37] praise you
[57:40] tonight he said when they got to the
[57:42] place where they were going on he acted
[57:44] like he was going to go
[57:47] by oh you know that's the way he acts a
[57:49] lot of times you think he's going to
[57:51] pass you right by he ain't don't worry
[57:53] he's not going to pass you by so he just
[57:56] act like he was going to go by and some
[57:59] of you may tonight he may be acting like

[58:15] got a message for you tonight he's
[58:18] exhorting you to praise Him notice
[58:21] brother B said when their eyes were open
[58:23] he said now he makes out like he's going
[58:25] to go by them but they constrained him
[58:28] to come in they persuaded
[58:31] him so they had to do something it
[58:35] wasn't just a oh praise

[59:19] something that he's always done before
[59:21] he begin to break the bread just like
[59:23] he's always done
[59:26] and their eyes were open and brother
[59:28] Brown said they didn't run back to the
[59:32] back back to wh they come from to argue
[59:34] their

[1:00:11] praise that's what we need to be doing
[1:00:13] is saying Lord we want
[1:00:17] you we want you to have first
[1:00:20] place the Bible says he's a jealous God
[1:00:26] he's a jealous God and God wants first
[1:00:30] place the unwelcome Christ some of you
[1:00:33] people this is a direct
[1:00:35] quote this don't apply to you that's
[1:00:37] here it's applying to those that are not
[1:00:40] here so we just straighten that out some
[1:00:43] of you people only go to church once a
[1:00:48] year well if it hurts I didn't say it he
[1:00:51] did but you can change it he says oh my
[1:00:54] it's Easter morning you put on your most
[1:00:57] Charming
[1:00:58] garments something about Easter man you
[1:01:01] got them Easter gowns or whatever y'all
[1:01:03] call them maybe it's not a gown it's
[1:01:05] your Easter lies and Easter this and
[1:01:07] Easter that he says you put your most
[1:01:10] Charming garments on your beautiful hat
[1:01:13] and you go down to church and you sit 20
[1:01:15] minutes and then you come back and you
[1:01:17] say well that settles it he says does
[1:01:20] Jesus accept it amen he accepts it he
[1:01:24] will take your 20 minutes once once a
[1:01:26] year of worship and
[1:01:28] praise he will accept it that's the
[1:01:31] gracious God that he
[1:01:33] is he says any place you'll give him he
[1:01:37] will accept it he'll never rebuke you
[1:01:40] for for it he will give you exactly what
[1:01:44] you give him he goes we have other
[1:01:46] things that we think are too important
[1:01:48] my brother my sister the most important
[1:01:50] thing in your life is to entertain Jesus
[1:01:54] Christ you believe
[1:01:56] that the most important thing in your
[1:01:59] life young people the most important
[1:02:01] thing is not what job you're going to
[1:02:03] get not who you're going to marry I know
[1:02:06] some of you young girls already got that
[1:02:07] all planned out but that's not the most
[1:02:08] important thing the most important thing
[1:02:11] in your life young or old is to
[1:02:14] entertain Jesus
[1:02:17] Christ he says I believe the most
[1:02:19] important thing in any life is to
[1:02:22] entertain Jesus Christ properly in first
[1:02:26] place in your
[1:02:28] worship all right even light that
[1:02:30] applies to us first place in your
[1:02:32] worship first place in your life first
[1:02:34] place in Everything Jesus Christ
[1:02:37] deserves that place amen I believe it
[1:02:39] with all my
[1:02:42] heart but we find many people today are
[1:02:45] still chasing the gold
[1:02:47] rush you know they're chasing that
[1:02:49] dollar they're chasing that that dream
[1:02:51] of being you know super rich or whatever
[1:02:54] it may be and you know you know I was
[1:02:56] out there in California and brother
[1:02:57] Johnny he's my interpreter and he said
[1:02:59] you know brother Joe he said the Gold
[1:03:00] Rush was out here and he goes there's
[1:03:02] the problem is that people are still
[1:03:04] seeking after him they're seeking these
[1:03:06] high-paying jobs and it keeps them out
[1:03:07] of church and you know they get some
[1:03:09] kind of name and some kind of title some
[1:03:11] kind of career and it keeps them out of
[1:03:13] the house of God and they putting these
[1:03:16] things before the house of God or before
[1:03:19] church are before the Lord and you find
[1:03:21] people put their hurts before the
[1:03:24] Lord well so so hurt me but what did
[1:03:26] Jesus
[1:03:27] do you taking your hurts out on him but
[1:03:31] you see serving God is not in their
[1:03:34] schedule
[1:03:36] until
[1:03:38] until there's an
[1:03:40] emergency until look this ain't no
[1:03:44] Band-Aid
[1:03:46] clinic this ain't an
[1:03:48] ER this is a house of
[1:03:51] worship we should come every day every
[1:03:54] time the doors are open open you should
[1:03:57] be able to worship God in your car
[1:03:59] worship God in your closet worship God
[1:04:01] in your home you should be able to
[1:04:02] praise God no matter where you are on
[1:04:04] the job off the job in Walmart you
[1:04:06] should be able to act like a mad man and
[1:04:08] ain't none of y'all looking mad
[1:04:13] tonight but we we are to entertain Jesus
[1:04:20] Christ and I wonder can the Bride Can
[1:04:23] his bride give him the entertainment
[1:04:26] tainment that he
[1:04:28] deserves that he desires the word
[1:04:31] entertain means to give attention or
[1:04:33] consideration to it means to hold the
[1:04:35] attention of pleasantly and
[1:04:38] agreeably so Jesus comes where he's
[1:04:42] invited let's look here in Luke 7 and
[1:04:44] verse
[1:04:49] 36 Luke 7:36 says one of one of the
[1:04:52] Pharisee desired him that he would eat
[1:04:54] with him and he went into the Pharisees
[1:04:57] house and he sat down to meet and we
[1:05:00] understand this is Simon and Simon
[1:05:01] brother Brown tells us that he was he
[1:05:03] was ashamed of him and brother B says in
[1:05:05] the unwelcome Christ you asked him to
[1:05:07] come to your church sometimes and he
[1:05:09] will fall in an oldfashioned way and
[1:05:11] you're ashamed to let loose and let him
[1:05:14] have his
[1:05:16] way I think this applies to many message
[1:05:18] churches yes I think it applies to many
[1:05:21] of us as
[1:05:22] Believers we invite him to our church
[1:05:25] sometime and will fall in an
[1:05:26] oldfashioned way and you're ashamed to
[1:05:29] let loose and let him have his way you
[1:05:31] quench him away you invite them to your
[1:05:34] home and then you're ashamed of them
[1:05:36] before your neighbors let them set there
[1:05:39] unentertained Jesus wants to be
[1:05:41] worshiped he wants to be entertained how
[1:05:44] do you entertain Jesus say come Lord
[1:05:46] come into my heart I love you Lord
[1:05:49] entertain
[1:05:51] him he goes look if someone would come
[1:05:54] in your house and you didn't entertain
[1:05:55] aain them they wouldn't come many
[1:05:58] times some of you wonder why nobody ever
[1:06:01] comes to your
[1:06:02] house well first of all you don't ever
[1:06:05] invite
[1:06:06] them but just think brother Aaron if I
[1:06:08] invited you to my house and I didn't
[1:06:10] Entertain You and I sat you over in the
[1:06:12] corner and I just looked at you and
[1:06:14] looked away and we're cooking the meal
[1:06:16] and you're smelling and you're hungry
[1:06:17] and I just looked away I didn't offer
[1:06:19] you anything you probably wouldn't come
[1:06:21] many
[1:06:23] times cuz I know you like e you're a
[1:06:27] foodie and that food smelling good cuz
[1:06:29] my wife's a good cook cooking that
[1:06:31] Indian chicken butter or butter chicken
[1:06:33] or whatever it is man smelling good with
[1:06:36] some some nice non bread I know I got
[1:06:38] your salava glands going right now and
[1:06:42] you just got to look at it you can sit
[1:06:43] there watch me and my family eat oh then
[1:06:46] night time comes and we're getting ready
[1:06:48] for bed and you're still sitting there
[1:06:50] nobody's acknowledged you nobody's made
[1:06:52] you welcome nobody offered you water
[1:06:54] nobody offered you a Diet Coke nobody
[1:06:56] offered you anything you wouldn't come
[1:06:58] back to my house if you would you're
[1:07:02] stupid and some sometimes I wonder if
[1:07:05] that's what we do to the Lord we invite
[1:07:07] him to our
[1:07:09] service and we set him over in a corner
[1:07:12] and we want somebody else to recognize
[1:07:14] him before we do we want somebody else
[1:07:17] to start the worship service before we
[1:07:20] do we want somebody to lift their hands
[1:07:22] in Praise before we'll get behind it and
[1:07:25] say you know what it's all right tonight

[1:07:51] be already worked up for what he's done
[1:07:53] for you and what he's doing for

[1:08:00] hear you say

[1:11:32] God begins to break down because his
[1:11:35] Jesus was
[1:11:37] invited and he's pushed to a
[1:11:40] corner and it happens in a lot of
[1:11:42] message churches but may it never
[1:11:44] happened in this
[1:11:46] church he goes I know he was coming he
[1:11:49] goes brother B says if I know he was
[1:11:51] coming I would have had a pan of water
[1:11:53] already waiting and but before I washed
[1:11:55] his feet I would have said Lord I'm not
[1:11:57] worried to worship you after I wash your
[1:11:59] feet so let me worship you first see
[1:12:01] that's what he wants he wants your

[1:12:06] there he is he's sitting there unwelcome
[1:12:09] the unwelcome Christ the anointed one
[1:12:12] the one that was going to pay the
[1:12:14] penalty of all their sins the one that
[1:12:16] was in a few days he was going to take
[1:12:18] the piercing in his hands the piercing
[1:12:20] in his feet he was going to die the
[1:12:22] death that you should have died and that
[1:12:24] I should have died and there was a
[1:12:26] footwash funky that didn't recognize who
[1:12:28] it was there was Simon the Pharisee the
[1:12:30] religious leader invited him to his
[1:12:32] house and he didn't make him welcome but

[1:12:59] Jesus sitting over there in the corner

[1:13:09] projects honeydew
[1:13:10] lists maybe too busy with our jobs and
[1:13:13] everything that needs to be done

[1:13:21] hurt and who hurt me and this that and
[1:13:22] the other to make him welcome
[1:13:26] too busy meditating on why I'm not
[1:13:28] worthy enough absolutely you're not but
[1:13:31] it doesn't matter your worth it was
[1:13:33] worth enough for him you was worth
[1:13:35] enough for him to leave all of all of
[1:13:37] Glory to come down and pay the

[1:14:58] to
[1:14:59] him and he says how do this flunky let
[1:15:03] him get
[1:15:05] by same way sometimes we
[1:15:08] do you're too preoccupied with you to
[1:15:12] recognize that the Lord God walked
[1:15:14] through the
[1:15:16] door you're too occupied with what you
[1:15:19] think and what you got to do to realize
[1:15:22] who walked through the
[1:15:23] door and he's walked through the door to
[1:15:26] be
[1:15:28] entertained cuz you invited him you
[1:15:31] invited him you invited him you say
[1:15:35] brother Joe if I would have been
[1:15:37] there I would have made Jesus welcome
[1:15:40] brother Joe if I'd have been there I
[1:15:41] would have washed his feet i' would have
[1:15:43] been the best foot washing he had ever
[1:15:45] got I would have anointed him I would
[1:15:48] have gave him a kiss of welcome but let
[1:15:49] me tell you what you are here
[1:15:52] tonight what you are in this service
[1:15:55] would have been exactly your response
[1:15:56] that day if you can't anoint him with
[1:15:59] praise tonight you would have never
[1:16:00] anointed his head with praise in if you
[1:16:02] can't give him a kiss of Welcome in the
[1:16:04] house of God tonight you would have
[1:16:05] never gave him a kiss of welcome there
[1:16:07] if you can't if you can't Cry tears of
[1:16:09] repentance and wash his feet you
[1:16:11] wouldn't have cried tears of repentance
[1:16:13] there and washed his feet so what you
[1:16:16] are here tonight as a worshipper you
[1:16:19] would have been there as a
[1:16:23] worshipper there he is Jesus sitting
[1:16:27] unwelcome dirty feet all he wants is
[1:16:33] praise all he wants is to be
[1:16:36] worshiped and here the Simon the
[1:16:38] Pharisee and all these other ones didn't
[1:16:41] recognize who was in their midst oh but
[1:16:44] there's
[1:16:45] one the Bible says there was one that
[1:16:48] recognized who was there there was one
[1:16:50] the Bible reads like this it said and
[1:16:52] behold a woman in a city which was was a
[1:16:56] sinner notice when she knew that Jesus
[1:16:59] sat at meeting the Pharisees house she
[1:17:01] brought an alabaster box of ointment
[1:17:03] this word woman of the city means she
[1:17:05] was a sinner means she was a harlot she
[1:17:07] was Notorious public prostitute but yet
[1:17:11] something struck her she knew she
[1:17:13] shouldn't have been there she came to
[1:17:15] the service and she looked in and she
[1:17:17] saw Jesus sitting over there an Evite
[1:17:20] Tabernacle with dirty feet unwashed
[1:17:22] unwelcome but something moved in her
[1:17:24] heart she knew she was a prostitute she
[1:17:26] knew she had a past but something struck
[1:17:29] her heart brother a and she said I gotta
[1:17:31] get to Jesus I gotta make him welcome
[1:17:34] he's at one oh I don't know what I'm
[1:17:35] going to do but I'm going to worship him
[1:17:38] I got to get to his
[1:17:39] [Applause]
[1:17:43] feet her heart was
[1:17:45] moved to make him welcome she looked
[1:17:48] back in the corner brother B says and
[1:17:50] there he sat he says oh think of it he's
[1:17:54] invited
[1:17:56] and he's not made welcome she said if I
[1:17:57] could just get to him I'll ask him to
[1:18:00] forgive me for my sins I'll asked him to
[1:18:04] forgive me for my wrong for the life
[1:18:06] I've lived and I wonder what about us
[1:18:09] he's here we've
[1:18:13] invited he's not welcome in many
