the pressures that it entails but father this morning we want more of you Lord we want more of your goodness your mercy your grace your healing your deliverance your Supernatural your Miracles God we just want more of your sign and your wonders Lord we want more your presence of your Holy Spirit Lord the power of God to live a Victorious Life we just invite you this morning Father that you would come Lord in every heart every life that you would impact it in a positive way this morning through the preaching of the word Lord and we just invite you now father May the spirit of Christ be in our midst dwell Among Us this morning Lord speak through these lips of clay and father may you anoint the ears of the hearer that they can they can hear what the spirit is saying father God we love you now we just Commit This service into your care into your hands father bless us in your presence we pray in Jesus name amen well it's certainly good to be back with you to be home okay maybe some of y'all are happy to have us back all right that was a long four weeks for me and I'm glad to be home here back amongst the home church we had some tremendous meetings there in Marius and also in Indiana this past week I'll share some of the testimonies toward the end of the service today uh I want to say thank you for your prayers thank you for your support uh as we go out we're in an extension of even night Tabernacle and I can say that uh God really used us not just me but Brother David Mayer in a very special way for the island there for the Believers they hadn't had a camp meeting in 5 years and uh the pastor made a comment he said we have never had a camp meeting quite like this this is by far the best meeting we've had and I'll share some testimonies at the end of what God did there but you know God still does the same today he doesn't just move in one place that he can't move in another place but he's God and he's God all the time and I want to speak to you by the grace of God this morning brother David spoke on this and it just resonated in my heart he spoke when we were there The Winds of Pentecost still blow and I sent him a text I Saidi still in your title because it just resonated so much in my heart and I want to speak to you today on the Winds of Pentecost still blowing we look here in John 14 and verse 16 and we'll also look here in Acts one kind of start building our foundation this morning John 14 and verse 16 it says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you notice the promise in verse 18 I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you then we look over here in Acts acts 1 and verse one says the former treaties have I made of the aest of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Spirit had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom he also showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them commanded him that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he you have heard of me verse 5 for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence and when they were there come together they asked him saying Lord will thou this time restore the Kingdom of Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons for which the father had put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you shall be a witness unto me in both Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and other most parts of the earth God bless you you can have your seats this morning so again we're going to look here just for a little while this morning and uh to still brother Tim's frases we only have one service a day and I'm not sure exactly how far we'll get into it today I have a lot of material but I do want to share a lot of testimonies toward the end so we can see what God has done here at even light Tabernacle we have many powerful testimonies here but they don't just reside here at even light Tabernacle we serve a living God that has done the miraculous around the world and by the grace of God I want to show that and declare that today but we find the Bible says but you shall receive power in verse 8 after the Holy Ghost has come upon you that word there is dunamis and it means power to perform Miracles right so don't ever get in your mind that the days of Miracles is over because here we have a promise of receiving power and that word power is a power to perform Miracles it's an inherent power a power residing In A Thing by the virtue of its nature notice the power is not your human ability the power power is not your human makeup but the power is a supernatural power that is end doing the people from the receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost otherwise we're receiving the very same power the very same life the very same ability to perform the supernatural that Jesus did that the apostles did you and I do as well and the Bible tells us in Acts 2 it says when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in one Accord in one place so I want to just kind of take this for a minute and break this down this word Accord there one Accord that means they were all in one mind right now look there's probably over 120 here today and none of us are all in the same mind we have different ideas different opinions different way we receive things different Revelations that maybe somebody else doesn't receive but the Bible says they were in the same mind the same affections the same desires the same wishes they were concentrated on one object every man having the same end in view none of them were uninterested none of them were unconcerned none of them were lukewarm they were in one mind and one Accord so you're telling me there's 120 men and women in the upper room no doubt they had different ideas no doubt they had different opinions no doubt they had they didn't see everything that Jesus preached exactly the same come on but their differences didn't make them any less C their difference didn't make them any less a brother or sister the difference didn't make them any less a Believer notice they were all in the upper room they all had a purpose for coming they all were called and they all went so we find they were all in one Accord they were concentrated on one thing of being endued with power from on high they otherwise for a little while they put their differences aside and they focus on one thing and maybe if we can put our differences aside this morning maybe the things that you've been going through maybe this one rubbed you the wrong way but put it aside this morning and be concentrated on one thing that the days of Pentecost are still here that the Winds of Pentecost still blow God still moves God still heals God still delivers God still sets free God still Saves The Lost God still does what God does so notice it's not about all of our differences it's about being concentrated on one thing and I believe there's an people who's concentrated once again on receiving the same power the same anointing that they received on the day of Pentecost we should be expecting to receive it today we should expect the Holy Ghost to move in this service this morning notice they were under expectation of receiving the baptism of Holy Ghost though their ideas varied though their opinions varied though they didn't see everything ey to ey and I believe as we as Sons and Daughters of God we're not going to see eyol on every Doctrine we're not going going to see eye to eye on everything that brother Brandon preached you're going to get a different Revelation than what I get a revelation and maybe they vary a little bit but as long as we're concentrated on one thing his coming come on we're concentrated on his coming and I'm not going to sit there and worry about my differences with brother Aaron though we don't have any but if we did I'm not going to sit there and worry about that and get all caught up on that look our focus is his coming and our Focus this morning should be his coming into this service moving upon hearts and lives and the Winds of Pentecost can blow in here this morning and set the backslider straight and move in in homes and restore marriages and heal the broken bodies he's the same God today get your minds off your differences and get your minds back on Jesus Christ the word made flesh and the Bible says when the day of Pentecost had fully come notice they had to wait until the day of Pentecost fully came that means up until the 50th day they went into the upper room on day 40 after Jesus departed right and they waited and sometimes we got to wait for the coming of the Lord it may not be the first service it may not be the second service but you keep coming you stay long enough and the Bible says and then suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled but wouldn't that be glorious this morning if we can all just be filled we can all just be filled with the Holy Ghost and they began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance see not this was not just any wind that blew in this was not just the little breeze that lulled them to sleep but the Bible says it was a rushing Mighty Wind It suggested force and speed and the word wind here is the Breath of Life notice what was coming brother Aaron into that building the Breath of Life came like a force like a a a a uh a force of speed and it came and Jesus tells us in John 11 and 25 he says I am the resurrection I am I am the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live then we find in John 14:6 Jesus said unto them I am the way the truth and the life so we find that there was a promise given to them of receiving the Holy Ghost and then when they got there in the day of Pentecost fully came the presence of almighty God came not like a gentle breeze but like a mighty rushing wind and it filled the house wonderful the Breath of God be to blow in what did The Winds of Pentecost blew down on the day of Pentecost and the same wind still blow today he doesn't stop being God just because of our nature and the AG in which we're living in he's still God and he still moves and he still blows and he still fills with the breath of life so I will say it like this we have today the blessings of Pentecost not the organization but the experience it's now that Christ reveals himself yes sir it's not in another generation it's not in another age it's now he reveals himself by the word not just by the letter but power and manifestation of the word the word performing signs and wonders doing what it says it'll do and I ask you where is he at today where is the manifestation of his word today the prophet of God said deity is not in heaven it's in you don't look for another Camp don't look for a favorite preacher don't look for a special meeting deity is not in heaven it's in you this morning sitting right here on the Pew he's here amen not just because we can quote the scripture that in them where the presence of two or three will be there I'll be in their M no it's not that we have the physical manifestation because we've received the promise of the Holy Ghost and if we received the promise of the Holy Ghost then shouldn't signs and wonders follow our Our Lives now I'm going to break a base a foundation here and brother uh brother Josh kind of hit this at the camp last week but I will go ahead and tell you before I left macius I was already studying this thought and had a lot of stuff already put together and it was just uh just a confirmation that I was in the right chain but he said the Keystone of the Bible is the Revelation that God never changes come on let's get with me this morning God never changes he said that his ways are unchangeable as he is Hebrews 13:8 we quote it's a favorite scripture to many of us if not all of us Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we believe that Ecclesiastes 3 and ver14 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever that means he never changes nothing can be put to it brings him down to Revelations 22 nor anything taken from it and God doeth it and Men shall fear before him that which has been is now notice that which has been is now God never changes that which he has done he will do again today that which has been is now and that which is to be ha already been and God will require it that which is to pass and brother B says here it is an unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at the first age he will have to keep doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change come on church he said what God did in the first age is what he wants to do in all the age ages oh my so we find what did God do in the first AG he breathed life into the church and if he breathe life into the first church won't he breathe life again into the last church if he Breathe Into The Omega and they perform the supernatural won't he breathe into or he breathe into the alpha and they perform the supernatural won't he breathe once again into the Omega Church and provide her rapturing faith so that she can receive her Lord and be caught away in his coming oh I'm telling you the same Winds of Pentecost still blow the notice now no longer were they a powerless group no longer were they just trying to debate what the what the Messiah said or what the great teacher said now they were endued with power from the almighty the life of the Creator the one who spoke the worlds into existence was now living and dwelling in the lives of 120 amen notice they were empowered to do the same things that Jesus did come on I'm looking at some jesuses out there you've been empowered by the word not by just a prophet but by the scriptures by the word to do the very same thing he did notice now what he did then he does today yes that's right what he was then he is today that's right see men change churches change societies change but God never changes nor does his word change for it ever Remains the Same through every age through every generation he remains constant and his word remain constant he's an unchanging God and when you look in the Ephesian Church a brother B says the word can't change or be changed because it's word the word is God and we find here in John 1 he says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word can't change and then brother brand drops down into Revelations 22 he says if any man shall add unto the things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written there in and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God will take away his part out of the book of life so God never changes we're not to inject our own understanding we're not to pull away and say well this one's not used today it was only for that generation or that age no God's word never changes he is the same yesterday today and forever yeah and if his word is the same then the then the Miracles and then the the expectations and the signs and wonders must produce the same results that it did then and through every generation and through every Church age it must be the same because why it's the same anointing it's the same spirit it's the same power let me tell you the same Pentecostal winds blowing therefore it must produce the same signs and wonders now I'm not basing this service just on signs and wonders but I'm trying to declare to you God doesn't change so don't think that oh because we're in leoda and we find the society closing in around us chaoses all around that God stopped being God that's right he is very much God today still on the throne still interceding that's right notice the prophet would tell us the L the C and age ends when the bride is taken up listen what the prophet says now thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard you argue with that and say we don't need Miracles we don't need signs we don't need wonders I'm telling you what a prophet said that the Pentecost is the standard what God set up in the beginning is the standard through every age Until the End Time age that's right what he was there he is tonight amen amen that is the pattern there is no other pattern no other he says no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages closed yes sir and we find that the church ages close out when the bride is taken up when the Rapture of the church Rapture of the Bride takes place then the leot to C and AG closes out then he goes back to the Jews so but we find many today that want to say and declare that the apostolic age is over may be over for some but it's not over for us come on that's got to be your conf your confession it may be over for some but it's not over for us what you say brother Joe what do you mean by Apostolic age well I look that up just because I like to do a little bit thorough because you know what I'm from Mississippi we're not all that bright but the word Apostolic age or the reference there is related in to the seccession of Spiritual Authority from the apostles otherwise the same Authority that he gave the apostles men are declaring today that that is over that God doesn't do Miracles anymore that it was only for the 12 it was only for the New Testament that the works of the Holy Ghost that he did in the book of Acts cease to exist God doesn't move that way anymore they declare that the apostolic age is over well they too late come on even like Tabernacle I said they're too late we got testimony after testimony after testimony right here in this building that proves that they're too late that God still moves and the Winds of Pentecost still blow he is still God they claim that the works of the Holy Ghost in the apostles in the book of Acts no longer exist men today claim that the Miracles are passed that God doesn't do them anymore some claim that now that we have the revealed word we no longer need these signs and wonders notice now we're going to look here in Mark 16 I got all day so we're just going to take our time this morning Mark 16 and these signs we're going to just let's go to this a there we go now now we got some power Mark 16 notice now it says these signs shall follow them that Believe come turn that down just a little bit brother Dave you don't mind says in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and they shall drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall shall recover now notice that's in the New Testament that's what Jesus in my Bible that's red letter let me say it nowhere do I find an expiration date on this scripture nowhere does God say it's going to only go through six ages and in the seventh age that this scripture is not going to be in effect but it says these signs shall follow the key here is the believer notice if you want to say the days of Miracles is pass it shows that you're not a Believer but for the believer this morning the days of Miracles are still present God is still moving God is still blowing Supernatural is still taking place the sick are still being healed demons are still being cast out because it's no infallible word of God and his word never changes notice let's go to John 14:11 believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake notice he's telling Jesus Is Telling if you can't believe me that's if you can't believe that I am who I say I am then believe the works cuz some people have a hard time believing the preacher but he's saying believe the works notice verse 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth the key now in both of these scriptures is believing he that believeth me in the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto the father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name I will do it that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name name I will do it so we find in John 14:12 Jesus declaring that this is going to continue that's right this will continue John 14:12 The Works that I do shall you do also will continue if you continue to believe but if you don't want to believe if you want to give up and say well I just got to live like this I just got to go through these trials and you know there's no hope there's no way out there's nothing for me and you choose not to believe then this scripture doesn't app Li Li to you but if you will believe this morning and take God at his word this morning then the same works the same signs the same Miracles the same Supernatural the same speaking in tongues the same interpretations the same outpouring of the Holy Ghost the same winds that blew on the day of Pentecost will blow right through even light Tabernacle this morning will'll blow right through your screen this morning it'll blow right in there it'll bring healing to your body it'll bring restoration to your marriage let me tell you it'll heal the church it'll take care of situations in a church because why because the Winds of Pentecost still blow we don't put an expiration date on the word of God this word will continue on until the bride is taken up and the L and c and age closes out but until then let's have a good time in the presence of God until that time let's receive and let's let the winds blow Upon Us blow upon our church blow upon our homes blow upon our children blow upon our marriages Let The Winds of of the Holy Ghost breathe life into us this morning see men who believed and received the Life of Christ actually produced the same results that Jesus did right so what we find now we're looking today on the Winds of Pentecost and we find it in the book of Acts we find a lot of the Supernatural come on and what the church was at in the book of Acts is what the church should be in leot deia the true church okay so what we find in the book of Acts is John 14:12 and Mark 16:17 and 18 in action we find a people that believe we find a people that took God at his word we find a people that went to the upper room got fill with the Holy Spirit and now they begin to do exactly what Jesus did the same works that he did while he was alive in his Earthly Ministry was being now manifested in and through the lives of those that were filled with the Holy Ghost why because he had breathed life into them and This Promise of the same works that he did the Bible says we would do also it would continue to the consummation and notice I want you to know this morning that it didn't end in A New Testament it didn't end with the apostles it didn't end with prophets it didn't end with the church A's Messengers it didn't end with brother brandham but what God was he is what God did he still does that's right come on we got to be in one agreement with that this morning what he was he is what he did he still does he never changes brother B want tell us like this he promised a little while the world seeth me no more but yet you shall see me I as a personal pronoun I will be with you even in you even to the consummation or the age and that word now he goes declares he says now that's the end of the world so to the end end of the world he will be the same he will be the same so look Church go read through the book of Acts and find out what we're to be come on go read through the book of I just started reading through the book of Acts again because I want to see what I'm entitled to brother here I want to see what I'm entitled to I want to see look God if this is in there that I can receive just that much I'm not asking anything outside of that I'm not asking for anything more than that but Lord just as long as my life if my family if my church as my children if we can produce exactly what's in that book then I'll be Satisfied why because then I'll know that the same signs the same wonders the same works that you did there you're doing today and I'll be pleased with that work and I believe he will be pleased with that work notice he is the same and promised that a little while the world seeth me no more the cosmos won't see me but you shall see me that's the church that's the believer you're going to see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that makes him the same yesterday today and forever so St John 14:12 he said he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also so we see the scriptures we can't deny those scriptures that's right and what the church was at Pentecost is the standard look it's not up for debate it's not up for debate I don't care if you're intellectual it's not up for debate I don't care if you want you don't have the Dynamics in your church it's not up for debate what the church was at Pentecost is the standard and he never changes therefore what he did then is what he's going to do today let me tell you if you ain't had a move of the spirit in 20 years shame on you get into the anointing of the Holy Ghost and let that same power that moved on you 20 years ago move you again today because the Winds of Pentecost are still blowing he didn't just stop 20 years ago for you in a camp meeting when you gave your heart to the Lord or you received the initial outpouring of the Holy Ghost but he is the same today and there's one initial feeling but there's many many many refilling and it's high time some of us getting L for the refilling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and say breathe on me this morning Lord breathe the power of the supernatural in my life this morning don't let me be lukewarm in different cold and form but let me be on fire for the things of God let the same power that came in that day in that room let it come upon me this morning let me have a personal Revival I'm not looking at my neighbor my preacher my pastor I'm looking for my own Revival this morning notice brother said he's the same yesterday today and forever don't let that just be a cliche don't let it be a cliche if he is the same then expect the same come on young people when you go to church or you go to a camp meeting what he did there I'm going to share some testimonies with you at the end of but the power of got in a youth meeting and what he was in Marius I'm here to tell you he's the same today what he was at Ohio he is the same today what he was at our Easter Camp he is the same today infallible proofs that he's still alive infallible proofs that he's still moving in hearts and lives notice now he's the same yesterday today and forever only the Corporal body notice what the prophet says here he uses our body Oh my he uses our body he's not here in his Corporal body but he using your body your hands your feet your mouth your ears come on and I'm not SC you that but some of you ain't moved in a long time come on let them have access to the body let them have access to your mind let them have access to your hands let them have access to your feet let them have access to your mouth he ain't coming from bobbleheads he's coming from worshippers praisers those that will lift up his name those that would expect his coming notice what he says now he's Divine we're the branches then the spirit would act again just exactly like it act when it was in him so we can go through the gospels and we can see exactly what the scriptures or what the spirit did in Jesus and he thought it not robbery to be equal with God then why should we think of robbery to do the same signs and same wonders and perform the same word oh come on now see brother says that's how Jesus was known as a messiah and he's the same Messiah today as he was then only without a Corporal body here on Earth so he sent his Spirit back to you your body and my body woo yeah some of you getting quiet on me sent the spirit back to you your body I know some of us when we get in i w let me just move on cuz I was about to condemn myself and I'm like we ain't doing that today you know how it is you want to bless people off the road in front of you so we just we're going to leave that alone my wife's looking down like yeah you better move on but notice notice what he says in the rising of the sun he being the groom the bride has to come forth he being the groom the original word the bride has to come forth cuz it's part of him it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of of all Revelations any others has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride but notice she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him so the very same life that lived in the groom was manifesting and should manifest through her if we have received if we had the revealed word which I believe we do how many of you believe we have the real word the Vindicated word the restored word then we should also have the same evidence we should also produce the same works that original word produce there will be a people notice there will be a people whom signs and wonders will work through it will follow their lives it will vindicate that they really are in fact True Believers because the Bible says these signs shall not maybe not if but shall follow the believer notice therefore the apostolic age isn't over it's only over for those that refuse The Works of the spirit it's only over for those that refuse to believe but for me and my house we're going to believe sir for us in the church we're going to believe for the ministry here even like in the church we're going to believe that the same signs and same wonders same God God still does it brother man says as a man and a woman are one the woman taken from Messi she had she had taken a spirit the femin spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics until the church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics the spirit of God that moved him do the same things that he did if it hit on 16 cylinders so the bride amen for he said John 14:12 he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also and I will notice here listen to this and I will give him a charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I will raise him up again in the last day and that's what we're looking for is a charge of the Dynamics to charge your mechanics this morning yeah you're a Believer yeah you read the scripture yes you believe God sent a prophet yes you believe the end time message but God send the Dynamics Down Let The Winds of Pentecost blow and charge that word and make that word live out through human lives so Scholars may tell you the apostolic ages over and I'm coming from the Ephesian Church age he says such a statement is wrong on two accounts first of all it is wrong to suppose that there AR any more Apostles I'm not saying men calling themselves apostles I'm talking about God anointing Apostles and sending them out just because the original 12 are dead and Apostle means one sent and there are many sent ones today but they are called missionaries he says as long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of Life there is an Apostolic age going on now part two of that he says they refer to an age of manifested holy ghost power is being over since the Bible has been completed he said that's untrue he says there is not even one scripture that suggests that but by many conclusively state otherwise here's our proof that both of these charges are false let's go to Acts 2 and verse 38 and we're very familiar with this scripture Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise notice now for the promise is unto you to your children to them that are far off even even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and the prophet will say the promise of the power with which the apostles were endued in Pentecost is to you the Jews and to the children the Jews and to all that are far off the Gentiles as to many as the Lord God should call both Jew and Gentiles until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and the power will not cease that's right I said until he stops calling I didn't say when men stops calling but I'm saying when God stops calling then the Pentecostal age and his power will cease but God is still calling God is still moving and the Winds of Pentecost are still blowing in lives therefore on the basis of Acts 2 and verse 38 I declare to you that the Winds of Pentecost are still blowing men and women are still being filled with the Holy Ghost come on young people are still being endued with power they come into the meeting one way and they lead all together different hearts and lives are still being changed Supernatural Miracles are still being performed see the Life of Christ returns in the form of the Holy Ghost not a nail scar but the Corporal body is sitting on the right hand of God to make intercession but the Holy Ghost has come to carry on his works the Holy Ghost now how many of you got the Holy Ghost this morning then we should be seeing Works cuz the Holy Ghost comes to carry on his Works Mark 16 in action John 14:12 in action there's no way to get away from it notice Malachi 3 and verse 6 Malachi 3 and: 6 for I am the Lord I change not so we're declaring again once again he's God he never changes I am the Lord Brother man says now in the message of trial how can you people say that the apostolic age cease where do you get it how can a Vine come out and bear today can go out and bear an orange and this bear pumpkin he said it it would have to change its life and Malachi the third chapter God said I am God I change not what he was then he is today he always was and always will be there it is for all the naysayers for all the intellectual Giants that want to say that that the movement of the Holy Ghost is over it's done with we don't have it anymore since a Propet went off the scene that's a word that's a seed of discrepancy cuz we got Bible proof that the word continues to S nowhere did he put an explanation or an expiration date to it then we find in the message the Ephesian Church age he said what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right that means incapable of being alien iated surrendered or transferred what we received on the day of Pentecost is a right that can't be surrendered we're not giving it up it can't be alienated we're not going to abandon it what he was on the day of Pentecost he is again today and what the church was then we are today Church we're not giving it up we're not backing down we're not surrendering we're not bowing to the the society in which we're living in it may be woke up and it may be indifferent but there is a people in the end time that will stay true to the word of God because they're not doing it of their own selves they're not doing it of some man's Spirit but they're doing it because they received the same holy spirit that blew in on the day of Pentecost it's still blowing today it's still moving today originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost that's what the church had originally so why do we not want that in our midst you saywell brother Joe Wicked and adulterous in generation seeketh after a son I'm not seeking it but I'm expecting to follow me that's right I'm expected because I believe the same word I received the same spirit and if I been believe the same word in the same works and I've received the same Spirit I'm not seeking the signs but I'm looking back wondering yes there they are yes that's evidence yes that's a Vindication that I am in fact a True Believer and if signs and wonders are not following your life then it may be that you don't really believe what you think you believe but when you believe church I say when you believe there ain't no devil in hell can stand before you ain't no demon of Torment can stand before you if you can believe all things are possible to them that'll believe nothing is impossible with you if you can believe the pro why would the Prophet come out with only Bel because that was a theme song and it's the theme of our message believe the word believe the signs believe the Wonders believe the supernatural believe the Miracles believe that he's the same Hebrews 2 and verse1 says therefore therefore we ought to give a more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we shall let them slip verse four God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will I'm trying to stack it to you I'm trying to show you don't you back off the promises of God if he bear them witness with signs and wonders Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost and he's the same then shouldn't we expect the same signs and wonders and miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost today if he's the same and he cannot change I say God here am I let the Winds of Pentecost blow on me Let it Blow on my church Let it Blow on my family Let it Blow on our young matter of fact Let It Blow some of these old people that got so starching indifferent Let It Blow today God let it move us and may we Frolic in the wheels of the Holy Ghost may we not get starchy cold and formal but God may we loosen up and rejoice in the Supernatural and rejoice in the presence of almighty God may we receive the blessings of Pentecost it's a promise given to you church it's not a by word that's why Jude said I I continue to to I contend for the original fith that was once delivered Jude was contending for that same experience and if jeude contended for it shouldn't we contend for it the word contend means to struggle for it in defense of he was standing in defense of the supernatural he wanted to see the same display listen what brother Bram says here he said the original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated it was despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word pattern and the church today the believer today is going to stay with the original word pattern what is the word brother Joe not just a preaching of the word not just a letter cuz the letter kill it but the spirit gives life it's manifestation of the word declaring that that word is really living notice brother say brother Bram says now now don't get LED astray here when I said that God and his ways never changeed I did not say that the church and its Messengers could not change the church isn't God so she can change but what I said was that because of the unchanging God with unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect ACT of God and then judge by that standard that is how it's done the true church will always all right good you said it I didn't have to ask you always try to be like the original at Pentecost so the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate the that early first one hey I got a news flash for you they staggered like a bunch of drunk men and women oh so what are we going to do today well that ain't my nature brother Joe I just don't like all that kind of preaching I'm not asking about your nature I'm not worried about how you feel about it I'm talking about getting filled with the power of the Holy Ghost cuz brother B said now when you get the Holy Ghost you'll act in ways you didn't think you would act you would do things you didn't think you would do let me tell you when I used to go to the bar and I got drunk I did some stupid stuff and in a clear mind and a sober mind I would have never done so what am I telling you this morning if you can just get South drunk on the presence of almighty God you may act in a way this morning you never thought you would act you may stumble around you may run in the spirit you may get up and shout and speak in another tongue but let me tell you don't worry about how you're going to act just start drinking from the power of God and let the fountain open from the House of David begin to flow down and keep drinking and push out and drink and push out and drinking push out until you're so South struck on the power of the Holy Ghost you ain't worried about it we're going to carry you out of this church don't be ashamed of the power of God for what the church was then she is today and the end time church will try to approximate what that first church was but I would declare to you it's more than just getting drunk on the spirit it's more than just speaking in tongues it's more than stumbling out of an upper room they lived the life behind it they liveed the life and signs and wonders followed him all through the New Testament we're going to get there he said now as like be gets like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will all will follow the Apostle Paul the first message to the first church age it is that simple and that wonderful wow it's that simple so notice in the beginning when God swed his seed upon the Earth he gave it in the hearts of his children his family to keep that word that was their daily defense keep the word and here comes the enemy in and he broke their barriers by sewing seeds of discrepancy contrary to the word of God if that was discrepancy in the beginning it still is today anything that'll add anything to the word of God is still a seed of the script I don't care where it come from if was from an organization if it's from a military Source if it's from political Powers anything that's contrary to the word of God is a seed of discrepancy and brother says when man stands and says he's the gospel preacher and says that the days of Miracles is passed that's a seed of discrepancy when he says the Miracles and the apostolic agees passed he said that's a seed of discrepancy when he says there's no such thing as Divine Healing that's a seed of discrepancy when he says well you can be baptized in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost that's a seed of the Scrapy it wasn't so from the beginning he says it's okay for you women to put on pants that's the seed of the Scrapy it wasn't so from the beginning because it says that women shall not wear clothes pertaining to a man and let me say this it ain't right for you men to go around wearing shorts either cuz it wasn't so from the beginning it's a seed of discrepancy it shows you've not received the seed of Christ going around we go to these camps now we got boys they got bracelets up to their arm about like this come on what are we doing are we raising a house full of women are we raising men are we raising our women to be Godly sisters are we raising our boys to be Godly men or we just going with the generation but a people that's receed the power of the word they received the same anointing and The Same Spirit they'll get back to what it was on the day of Pentecost men will be men women will be women come on now notice he said we can have only one type of branch and that's a Pentecostal branch in the church with Pentecostal experiences woo some of us got to dial to our old Methodist belief that old Methodist Branch Baptist Branch Pentecostal Branch Apostolic Branch then we got to have white shirts up to our neck can't show no skin come on where are we bringing that stuff into the message for no stay with the word God sent us a Vindicated message message line up to it I'm going to tell you I don't think they had white shirts back in that day and let me tell you not all of them listen to uh southern gospel music just for some of y'all music Fanatics out there that think we can't listen to anything else but southern gospel shame on you I just came from an island in the middle of the Indian Ocean they didn't play southern gospel you mention southern gospel what are you talking about they had their own style of worship their own style of music but but I can tell you one thing it brought down the power of the Holy Ghost every service so it ain't based on your man-made idea what you think the service should be how it should go it's based on what God has ordained and he's ordained the holy ghost in the power of His Spirit to come and move on the ministry to move into the church to ordain the church to flow with the Winds of Pentecost and he's the same today as he ever was he don't need you to stop him and and start trying to be God and identify what is right and what is wrong God does that he knows how to run his church let me go on a little bit further is this okay this morning notice we cannot find him in our Creeds we cannot find them in our denominations we got to find them back where we left them you say well I have brother bandam I tell you what I've done I've danced in the spirit a lot of us want to cling to that especially us young people you know we cling oh I had a moveing of the Holy Ghost I danced in the spirit he goes you know I got it he said it wasn't so from the beginning I spoke in tongue so I know I got it it wasn't so from the beginning that's right you say I shouted I got it it wasn't so from the beginning he said to know Christ is to know the person of Christ in the forgiveness of sin and it changes your life brother B says I've seen people dance Shout speak in tongues and so forth and live any kind of life so that he says so that couldn't be right I've seen them join churches shake hands baptized go through all kind of Creeds and still live like the devil it wasn't so at the beginning to meet him the person the Lord Jesus is to know him as your savior to know him as your lover to know him in life but these other Creeds and things never at the beginning was ever a witness by our Lord then he tells them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature how far all the world I thought Marisha was pretty close to the end of it it took us 30 hours to get there but we had a great time to every creature and these signs shall follow them that believe he said that's what it was at the beginning and anything contrary to that is not right you don't find it in Creed you find it in Christ he's the only one in my name you shall cast out devils and speak with new tongues and if they take up serpents look by all means don't bring any of them in here please leave your serpents at home if you want to handle them that's all fine but notice take up serpents or drink deadly things it shall not harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover that that's what the scripture said and anything contrary to that is a seed of discrepancy is that all right so he said it takes a personal experience of passing from Death unto life and becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus with Christ in your heart that's the Holy Spirit that's where it began but we got to get back where we left them Church well you say brother Joe we we belong to even like Tabernacle brother is our pastor he's been laboring behind this pull pit for many many many years we're good to go but each of us have to get back to a Pentecost you can't rest on brother Aaron he's got a great ministry you can't rest on brother Timothy he's got a great ministry you can't rest on brother Tim even though he's got a great ministry a legacy around the world you have to have your own Pentecost whether you're young whether you're old whether you're whether you're crazy it doesn't matter you must have the same initial outpouring that they received on that day you got to have it today are you are not going up understand me you are not going up and you don't want to be left here for what's about to happen brother B tells us now from the beginning it wasn't so he says when we see men has corrupted the world with their traditions and that's the problem a lot of it you know message preachers now have adopted Dr doson and all this psychology and all this intellectual stuff and they be they begin to corrupt the word of God with their Traditions look we don't need Dr doson God bless his heart maybe you know you can take some good things from there but we don't need him to tell us how to raise our children come on how many you got kids that's got the Holy Ghost parents don't be afraid to raise your hand they ain't that bad I hope I got four kids you know what I got great kids Dr doson didn't help me and my wife raise our kids and nor should he help you and but we've gone to Dr dson we've gone to Dave Ramsey and look there's some good things in Dave Ramsey but Dave Ramsey ain't gonna pay your house off but you get the Holy Ghost and you go operate by the stewardship of the Bible and the Bible principles you'll take care of the things and one day you'll reach that you won't be head over your heels in debt you'll live according to your means you don't need Dave Ramsey you don't need Dr doson we need the holy ghost in the church we need need the holy ghost in the family we need the holy ghost in the soul and then we can orchestrate correctly notice brother says let's go back to the beginning then if we can do that then you'll find Christ moving into that house that's built upon a solar right then these signs and wonders and every blessing that God promised will be manifested through the church Psalms 147 and verse 18 Psalms 147 Verse 18 it says he sendeth out his word and melted them he causes his wind that word there is his breath to blow he causes his wind to blow and the waters to flow so and then we find in John 3 Jesus answered and said unto him speaking of Nicodemus verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot not see the kingdom of God then we jump down and we look at verse five Jesus answered verily verily I say unto unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh but that which is born of the spirit is Spirit 1 Corinthians 12 and verse2 we find for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are are we baptized into the body so we must be born again how do we Born Again by receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost are we baptized into that one body and brother B says you cannot join the Church of the Living God you're born into it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost these virtues are sealed in it goes and the Holy Ghost and therefore he that's born of God does not commit sin because the seed of God remains in him see you can join even like Tabernacle some of you moved in you join the church some of you grew up in the church some of you cut your teeth on the pews of Evite Tabernacle but you cannot join the Church of the Living God you can move pack up and come here and leave here and go to another church and join in but you'll never join the Church of the Living God we must be born into the church how are you born into it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it ain't about dancing it ain't about speaking in tongu and ain't about all those things but he said when you get the Holy Ghost don't worry people will know you got it they will know your life will tell the story whether you got it or not notice brother B tells in Blasphemous names he say now the church is the mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God woo did you get it I like how he says that congregation says amen the Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathed breath into its nostril spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul did you know that the Pentecostals that the true Pentecostal church is born of the breath of god notice he breathed the Pentecostal winds blew in there and it breathe on the church breathe life into them he said the church the church is born of the Breath of God when this stature has molded itself up they're in a condition God's breath Breeze upon them receive the Holy Ghost then you are sons of God then he says you can join anything you want but you're born into the Church of the Living God born by the Breath of God God breathe upon them they said receive you woo he said the Holy Ghost and and and there you are he says now he says now not come join put your name on here and help us with soup suppers and all that join the laws join the Methodist laws or B Lodge or a presbyterian Lodge or a Catholic Lodge or a Pentecostal Lodge and let's just go ahead and put it even a mess l or message LOD but when you become a child of God you are born by the Breath of God Amen he said better leave that alone right there and some me tell you Church of the Living God if you're ever going to be born of the spirit of God then you got to let the same winds that blew on the day of Pentecost blow into your heart and breathe life into your life well you're no longer the same your desires are no longer the same you you no longer want to commit sin you no longer want to do the things that you used to do but now life was blown into you and you become a son and daughter of God God's life is also in you then though you can't believe me Jesus said believe the works that's how you'll know believe the works is I'm the vine you are the branches come on don't go to sleep on me this morning I'm the vine you are the branches he went to Brother sher's house and he sat there and he saw a citrus tree it was a believe it was a an orange tree and it had lemon tangelos tangerines grapefruit all on it he says how in the world did all these other fruit get on that tree he said they were grafted in he said so when we pluck this Tangerine or we pluck this grapefruit from this tree when it puts out another fruit will it be an orange he said no it will bear the same life that's in the branch and so if we don't have the same original Pentecostal Branch inside of us oh all we will produce is a Methodist all we'll produce is a message believer but what am I telling you about if that Branch if that tree ever puts forth another branch and he says every year that tree will put forth another branch and the same light that's in the vine will live out through the branch and the fruit that's in that Branch will declare exactly what that tree is and what am I telling you this morning we want to be more than just a message grafted in believer we want to have the the same life that's flowing in the vine living out through US producing the same signs producing the same wonders speaking in Tong interpretation of Tong oh wisdom and knowledge and all the things that God declares in his word along with signs and wonders Supernatural healings and miracles that's the sign that life is in the branch because it's producing fruit see every time that tree gets old he said it puts out a new Branch it comes forth with oranges and if the vine itself puts out a branch oh notice now he goes excuse me we tried to join members into it to live under the name of Christianity because we are it's so common of a way of saying that the citrus fruit just a Christian Church he notice there's no difference today with us as Believers we don't want to be just grafted in Christians no when we got a stream we got a fountain that's filled with blood drawn from emanuel's blame we got light Life Giving flow why do we want to be grafted in when we can be born into it in the same life notice when that vine itself puts forth a Vine it'll be like the first Vine it put forth it'll be like the first Vine it put forth they wrote a book of Acts behind that one that's wo my my my my they wrote a book of Acts behind that Branch or that vine and if he's the same today won't they write another book of Acts see if it ever puts forth another one it'll write a book of Acts behind it so God isn't interested and grafted in message Believers generational Believers hanging on to ideas of man he's looking to put forth another Branch whether you're young whether you're old he's ready to put forth another Branch he's looking to breathe the breath of life into individuals and bring forth another act believer where signs follow where you're not a afraid to face the devil brother B said the church is packing so much with this kind of society and that kind of society what about the Society of Jesus Christ we have all these other things and we've been burning the church down but now there you are he says you can never join the church you join a lodge you're a member of a lodge a group of people just like a lodge but you cannot join the church you join the lodge of members but not a church for you are born into the church and the vine itself then he said God tempered his bride together with the spirit tempered his bride together with his Spirit then it tempers the individual together with the spirit then you're born into the kingdom of God he said there is a true member of the body of Christ no kind of name tacked on to it the very works of the individual proves where he comes from his life testifies what he is and when you're born of the kingdom of God then the life the very life that was in Jesus is is living out from you you don't have to ask people to come to church you don't have to have beg people beg you to come to church no because when those doors open you can't wait to get to church now I understand look we got to fight this human nature some of you wake up some of you woke up this morning didn't want to come but you drag this old thing to church because the spirit on the inside of you so notice now let me just go on a little bit further we're going to bring this down how do we get into the church brother Joe you're born what by the Breath of God that's a direct quote breathe on me brother B says Breathe on Me Spirit of the Living God breathe on me that's my prayer just let the Holy Spirit breathe oh my for the Breath of God what is it sealed away in the kingdom of God knowing that when I first confessed I believe Jesus Christ then to my faith I had virtue and godly virtue then I add knowledge of the word now notice he starts quoting second Peter 1:5 and he says beside this give all diligence add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and knowledge Temperance and Temperance patience and patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ when in the Blasphemous names brother B says so we're adding to knowledge Temperance and self-control then added virtue and knowledge and Temperance now I've got to add patience and he says I still ain't got the Holy Ghost yet then after I had patience I had godl you know what that is is to look like God or act like God and I add that and I don't misbehave and I I go like a Christian gentleman art to and I let that not be put on but something in me the love of God just boiling over not say uhhuh boy oh I wish I could do that but maybe I better not oh say it's it's there anyhow it's a birth I've been birthed into this into this into this and this and then the love of God Christ comes down and seals it up in me for service so he's saying add to your faith justification you start adding up and you go up that pyramid then he comes down and seals you with the Holy Ghost seals you with the Holy Ghost otherwise he gives you your adoption robe but that's what we're looking for he says then when you meet these qualifications and become a full Virtues Of God and the things of God then the Holy Spirit comes down and seals us into the kingdom don't worry everybody will know you got it come on don't worry everybody will know you got it you won't have to say well glory to God I know I got it I spoke in tongues glory to God I know I got it I dance in the spirit you won't have to say a word about it everybody will know you got it don't worry yes it'll testify of itself he will let it be known among men oh Hallelujah otherwise these signs will follow people will know that you got what you call claim to have he says but you're going to have to pay the same price have the same experience have the same thing moving in your life when God when the power of God Begin to Fall notice he tells them every man will have to pay the same price Mary had to go to the upper room the mother of Jesus so no matter what family you come from how dignified what kind of family heritage you're from no matter who your pastor is who your preacher is who the Deacon daddy is none of that mom sings the greatest specials in all the world it doesn't matter you got to come the same way yes you got to come the same way we're not getting in on Family Heritage we're getting in because we're in we're join airs with Christ but said the Holy Ghost is a real product you don't have to receive some duplicate or something wait till you get a taste of the original Mana that fell on the day of Pentecost yes sir he says there they there there was receive the Holy Ghost you know what's the matter with the church it needs a good old St Paul Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost taught it again that's right takes the fire coming down from heaven what's wrong with having a good old St Paul Revival this morning what's wrong with letting the power of the Holy Spirit fall in our church this morning do we think well it can only happen when certain preachers come no he's the same church let me bring this start bringing this down I'm not saying I'm closing so don't get scared God's characteristics characteristics excuse me Delany don't you put that on your reel put that on Note right now she knows what I'm talking about don't worry but God's characteristics will flow out through the Old Testament all the way to the New Testament cuz he is the same we find here in Psalms 146 verse 5 we're going to prove this to the scriptures right now he never changes says happy is he that hath the god of Jacob for his help whose hope is in the Lord his God how many can say hallelujah which made Heaven and Earth and sea and all therein which keepeth truth forever which executed judgment for the oppressed and giveth food to the hungry now this is characteristics of God now the Lord looses the Prisoners the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind the Lord raises them that are bound down the Lord loveth the righteous these are characteristics of Christ of Jesus of God the Lord preserveth The Strangers he relieve the fatherless and the widows but the Way of the Wicked he turneth upside down the Lord shall reign forever even thy God oh Zion unto all generations praise ye the Lord now Psalms 147 and verse3 let's notice let's look at some more characteristics of God he Health the broken in heart he bindeth up their wounds he tth the number of stars he calleth them all by their names Great Is Our God and the great power his understanding is infinite the Lord lifted up up the meek and he castes the wicked down into the ground so we find these scriptures and we find this characteristics being lived out in the book of Acts Peter heals a man in Acts 3 and verse one a crippled man and acts 3: 1-1 you don't have to put these up I'm going to run through them but this man was crippled from his birth but yet Peter says Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee and he immediately jumped up leaping and running and praising God so we find also in Acts 5 and verse 1-10 ananas and of fire are struck dead because they lied to the Holy Spirit then we find in Acts 512 through6 the apostles perform Many Wonders then we find Peter and John begin to tell about the Holy Ghost in Acts 8 ver verse 14-1 17 then Peter heals enus of in I guess that's his name enaas I'm gonna say it like that let's just do that healed him a pausy in Acts 9:33 and 34 then immedately right after that Peter raises up Dorcas from from Death in Acts 9: 36-41 Peter delivered out of prison by an Angel in Acts 12 through verse 7-1 17 then God smites Herod and miraculous and he dies in Acts 12-21 then Aus the sorcerer was smitten with blindness in Acts 13: 6-11 then we find Paul on his way to to to Damascus is struck down in Acts 9- 1-9 then we find Paul heals a in Acts 14 so we see a continual progression of the characteristics of God Paul cast out of the spirit of Divination in Acts 16 and we find that Paul and Silas prison doors open up just like they did for Peter God did it again because God never changes he opened the doors in Acts 16:25 through 26 and then in Acts 19 Paul talking to him about receiving the Holy Ghost there at Corinth and they received the Holy Ghost after laying on the hands then Paul heals multitudes in Acts 19 and verse 11 then we find that the young boy that fell out of the window Paul goes down and raises him back to life the same way Peter raised Dorcas back to life then we find Paul says you know what the scripture says that if they take up CPUs aite harm them then we find in Acts 28 3-6 Paul shakes off a Viper because he had a word of God declaring that he could do it then we find Paul heals publ and others so we find the same characteristics that was said in the Book of Psalms is living out in the book of Acts and what am I telling you if he's the same in Psalm he's the same in the book of act he's going to be the same in the loyaly the end time believer we can shake off the fiery serpant we can be healed in the name of Jesus we can Resurrect The Dead by the power of Jesus name what he was he is and what he did he does Brother David mayor made these comments when he preached this thought he said what's the use of the word if we don't use it what is the use of the word if we don't use it he says don't doubt the word just believe it and put it in action if you believe in the power of the word then you will see the power of God notice and I'm about to start winding this down getting ready for some testimonies brother B says his characterist characteristics I'm cutting eyes at you his characteristics continually identify him the same as he was when he lived on Earth so if the Holy Spirit and the life of Christ is living in us notice when brother Brown preached the token message he said it's the literal Life of Christ the literal life that's right not some by product not some Seminary not some denominational view but the actual life of Christ the token has come down in full obedience to the word of God entitles you to the Token life so therefore if that life is living inside of you his characteristics continually identify him the same as he was when he lived on earth he is still living here tonight in the form of the Holy Spirit he ever lives and his characteristics follow him just as it always did he is still living He said the unusualness of God the character of God had to display his characteristics in the Supernatural to show that he identified himself on the message so why does God do the supernatural to identify himself on the message he said notice the word is still the thing that identifies the characteristics of God the promise of the hour that we're living in every way he worked anytime he ever done anything he does it the same every time he doesn't he goes if he doesn't then it's his character has changed and if his character is changed and he is not God come on Church what God was he is in Joel 2:28 he says I will restore to you all the years that the Locust is eating a cankerworm the Palmer worm the caterpillar he says now we had Luther Luther did not restore it was just a Reformation we had the wesle age it did not restore pentacostal age did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not a restoration of the church or resurrection of the church it's the restoration of the church God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning if you don't want it you might as well leave cuz that's where we're headed back to the same Pentecost back to the same sign back to the same wers back to the same anointing back to the same word same power Same Spirit same sign same same God living among his people producing the same prison bars will wake open why because we're operating under the same and I say House of Hell won't you give way this morning to the name of Jesus Christ and let the Winds of Pentecost begin to blow through here and heal broken marriages and heal broken homes and set the captive free and deliver of cancer and heartache and sugar diabetes let the power of the Winds of Pentecost blow through in the message return of Jubilee brother Bram says the Pentecostal inheritance that's your possession not a denomination not the he goes Pentecost is your possession not a Pentecostal organization your fathers came out of such but a Pentecostal experience is your possession then he says get ready to cue that picture up he goes I'm looking for a Time To Break Forth for the spirit of God in these last days that we're living in now for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for rapturing Faith just before it comes this is a prophet waiting for another surge oh brother Aaron I think he looked down and he saw there was going to be another surge of the Holy Spirit and will produce rapturing faith of people that will believe he said the church is moving up the holy ghost power he said the holy ghost that we're justified by he goes you ministers know that don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us the Holy Ghost spills us and the Holy Ghost gives us rapturing face as we move up and I'm here to declare to you even the like Tabernacle I'm looking for another surge of the same Pentecostal to blow in every heart and every home and every life and every family and every Church of the Living God let the Pentecostal winds blow and let the moving of the spirit strike every heart and every home and every [Applause] need Psalms 145 Psalms 145 then we're going to start going through some testimonies verse three great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable that's right one generation key in on this one generation shall praise thy Works to another and shall declare thy Mighty acts don't tell me it's wrong to tell about testimonies don't tell me we're not here lifting up man we're here declaring what the word says one generation shall shall praise thy works praise the works of the almighty and shall declare thy Mighty acts he goes I will speak of the Glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works and Men shall speak of thy might of thy terrible acts and I will declare thy greatness they shall abundantly utter the memory of great of the thy great goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness oh don't you be ashamed to tell a testimony don't you be ashamed of telling the supernatural ceue up that first picture one generation shall declare the praise in thy Works to another this is from brother brother Daryl Ward sent me this I asked a bunch of ministers to send me some Supernatural occurrence that's taking place he said this sister came up for prayer in Ohio for a tumor on her ear he goes I went to pray for her and the tumor made me sick to even touch it her faith was so great that I thought was it was going to fall off right there in the meeting and he goes I was disappointed that it didn't but 4 days later he goes while she was walking around her house you can see that it left there was once a tumor on her ear but now it's gone why because we're declaring from one generation to the next generation of His Marvelous acts next picture this young boy had an incurable skin disease he was broke out from his head to his toe his grandfather called me while I was working in my back field and he said would you pray for my grandson he goes we had prayer for him over the phone notice now over the phone he had prayer for him and three days later he called me back rejoicing brother Daryl the doctor says he has brand new skin come on church if n can go down into the Muddy Waters and come up new can't we today go down in the power of the word and come up new again he's the same God hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever next picture we see this sister here she was an alcoholic and had been through a nstep program several times and could not quit drinking he goes we prayed for her and she began to scream I'm free I'm free I'm free and she's been sober for over two years now he's the same God he's the same God next picture this sister here was healed from a stage four kidney failure brother El said he sat down at the table with her and begin to pray with her when she went back to the doctors's her kidneys were normal normal kidneys stage four kidney failure then he was preaching that's the end of the picture but for right now then we find he sent me a note he said I was preaching on a Wednesday night and there was disturbance at the back of the church he goes I stopped preaching I told brother Donnie somebody was sick and they asked the Saints we asked the Saints to Bow their heads and we got to Sister Ruth Garland if you know the story she fell over dead in church and brother Donnie and brother Gerald go begin to pray for her and before the prayer was over she was up again she came back to life again and her her daughter took her to the hospital he said I got Mom home around 5:30 this morning they did a CT scan normal they did an EXT a chest x-ray normal they did blood work it was normal her sugar was slightly elevated no dehydration blood pressure was a little high the doctor actually had no explanation for what happened but we know God showed up now I'm telling you he's the same church if Peter could raise Dorcas if Paul can raise one from the dead don't you believe the same power and the same anointing and the same presence of the same Holy Ghost can do it today he's the same today brother Andrew Glover sent this to me just before I came out he goes I was preaching in the camp on Mark 11 a generation under the spoken word and how Jesus spoke to a tree and it dried up from its roots a young man came up for prayer his arms covered in eczema eczema he goes I told him that he'd been positioned to speak and just curse this thing and curse the root of it and it would dry up and he goes and the next night that young man came back for prayer or was having prayer and he started rolling up his sleeves and I thought he was coming back for prayer but he showed me his arms and he was completely healed it was all dried up he's the same God received this one from brother Donnie Reagan how many of you know Colin Atkins he's a young boy young boy good friends of ours he was diagnosed on September second was Celiac I'll tell you what that is it's a disease that's triggers an immune reaction to eating gluten here's some of the symptoms eating gluten triggers an immune response to the gluten protein in your small intestine over time this reaction damages your small intestines lining and prevents it from absorbing nutrients a condition called malabsorption symptoms of diarrhea fatigue weight loss bloating anemia he goes it also can lead to serious complications if it's not managed and treated in children malabsorption can also affect the development in addition to Gastro gastrointestinal symptoms there is no known cure for celiac the doctors have no known cure for celiac so his first endoscopy endoscopy revealed that he did in fact have Celiac on September to 2022 he goes back a year later August of 2023 after being on a strict gluten-free diet and there was no chance change whatsoever he still had Celiac but in August of 2024 Sunday before his third endoscopy Callin went up for prayer and brother Donnie told him that God had found favor with him oh come on church when God finds favor with you back up devil you can't hold him it may be incurable with God but God has found favor with you evening light God has found favor with you bride of Jesus Christ and can't no Devil stay when the god of heavens and earth has found favor with you he said brother Donnie told him to that God has found favor with him no matter what the doctor's report said keep a good confession that's right that following Tuesday morning after doctors completed the scope he met me and Ruth he goes and I and he told us that he saw no celiac he saw no celiac he he said keep in mind though with the other Scopes the Celiac was so bad that the doctors could visibly see it to diagnose him he said but everything looked great appeared completely normal but noted that he could not confirm this until the biopsies come back and a week later the the biopsies came back and confirmed no celiac so what's impossible with man is possible with God what's not curable to the doctors is curable with God this morning because he's the same god brother Jason dear sent me this he said there was a woman that could not have children for nine years she came and I prayed and en cursed her and now she's pregnant glory to God brother Trevor Eman from Indiana he goes we had a sister with malignant tumor on our ovaries the doctor had an x-ray and we prayed in a prayer meeting two weeks later the doctor took another X-ray and it was gone the sister has born two children sense brother Andrew Spencer sends this and we're all aware of it but the doctors declared that brother Ron had cancer in his eye and they were going to have to remove one eye in order to save the other eye but we prayed and we believed and before they did their final test they come back that he had no cancer in his eyes what am I telling you this morning I'm telling you that God is the same and what he done in the Old Testament his characteristics did they lived out through the the book of act and throughout the New Testament it's the same God with the same characteristic and the same anointing and the same power today not just an even night Tabernacle brother Jason Watkins sent me this native people in South Pacific Islands suffering from skin Affliction small poox he said A man was going down under water to be he was covered in cankerous sores and as he immerged sores washed off and he was sealed as receiving brand new skin brother Sean Kinga many of you may may not know him but he's been to our special meeting he's a pastor of the church there in Hammond Louisiana he goes I was complaining in my going to the family doctor around September 19th of 2023 and he sent me to a specialist and the specialist called me after running test and declared that I had cancer in my scrotum he goes I remember the story The Express agent bringing the box of snakes to to John Doe's address so after the specialist hung up the phone I went on my knees I told the Lord that I was not accepting this box of snakes I refused to sign for it and I just sent it back and the specialist sent me for blood work after three three readings that recommended that they were all negative I got a call from the specialist office that they had found no cancer not only but the pain is completely gone and I've not felt it since what am I telling you over and over and over that Cancer's been defeated and Satan's been defeated and the head of the serpent has been defeated why because the same word is here today with the same power the Pentecostal winds are still blowing Church brother the Sha Martin sent me this can I go a little bit longer brother sea Martin sent me this he says a few years ago I was ministering at a church and a brother came up for prayer because he had been given six months to live due to being ate up with cancer man we've heard that word enough had we being ate up with cancer he wanted me to pray that the Lord would give him Faith to receive his healing so I asked the church to pray with me he told me after service that as he was going back to his seat something just told him that he was healed and he goes he goes he leaned over to his wife and he says I don't know what happened but I'm Healed he went back to the doctor for his checkup and the doctor was totally shocked by what he couldn't find did you hear what I said what he couldn't find he declared that their brother was cancer free and that brother is still living today he had 6 months to live let me tell you they gave Ron spriter 4 months to live but the god that we serve the same winds that blew on the day of Pentecost blew there in Virginia and the same anointing and the same result and the same Supernatural God moves on the scene for those that will believe nothing is impossible same from Brother shy says a sister in our church had been hurting in her body she made an appointment with the doctor and he found a tumor and said he was malignant sister Orlando you remember how it was to get that call sister Sharon you're not here today but you know how it was Sister jie you know how it was to get that call Sister Ruth you know how it was to get that call some of you mom you know how it is to get that call but afterward she felt to come up for prayer on a Wednesday night and after I had ministered and she said the pain and left her right then she went back to the doctor and he run some tests and run more tests and he ran more tests he kept her all day running tests and he finally declared that he couldn't find the tumor oh come on Church don't get bored with these testimonies one generation shall declare to the next I'm declaring the supernatural power of God how many of you familiar with sister Stephanie Collins she's been deliv or she been suffering with dehabitation debilitating headaches for four to 5 years started when she was 18 years old and every year she'd have one or two very bad ones and seems like every time they got progressively worse and worse and worse to the point that she would lay in bed for 10 to 15 days she laid in a dark closet many days she seen three or four neurologists ent's multiple chiropractors multiple regular doctors headache specialist few natural doctors and even done acupuncture she had been given every drug phone at her but no answer she fought depression no doubt she Pro fought anxiety I'm sure missed her own children's birthday parties and a lot of family functions holidays Church meetings and even sold her vehicle because she couldn't drive she had so many dark and low days and even beg God to take her life but all she wanted to do was be well so she can take care of her family and on April 1 April 1st I'm not sure where my speech is going but on April 1st it was just another day dealing with headaches and she was laying in the B bed feeling down for herself and she clicked on the live stream of brother Jeremy Shriners and brother J.R reek was preaching and he be to tell about the supernatural about miracles and she listened for a while she said I almost turned it off but something said what if there's something for me and brother Jr started started telling about miracles that had happened and she started feeling something stir in her heart and she said you're my God too and I claimed this for myself and brother Jeremy was concluding the service and he was singing I'm going to see a victory and she felt the presence of God draw near as if she was in the service with him he stopped singing and he said I had a sister on my heart for the last 15 minutes I don't know if she's streaming in but sister Stephanie Collin was on his heart and he began to pray and when he did he spoke that the presence of God would go near to her and the same moment that he began to pray the power and the presence of God came into that room and let me tell you she says I wasn't aware or she goes I begin to sob and just begin to praise God for the victory in my life before she ever felt God do one thing she beun to declare the manifestations of the victory she says later on that day my daughter Sarah came in the room and said Mom I woke up this morning burden for you I asked God to do something Supernatural for you today so God will know that you will know God is with you she goes since April the 1st she goes I've taken down my blackout curtains I never never lay in the dark closet anymore I started to drive again she goes oh she goes you never she goes I never go to bed wondering what tomorrow will be like I make plans knowing that I'm able to fulfill those plans and today she's living headache free what am I telling you I'm telling you that he is the same if you're dealing with headaches this morning we serve a God that's greater than your headache we serve a God that does the supernal he's the same God can I go a few more brother Isaiah v bramit a prodical son grew up

by that time and divorce was in sight but her dad she went or not her dad but sister Julie went to Isaiah's dad and begin to talk to him about it and he encouraged her to start praying for the family bear in mind she was not a Christian she was she had a Catholic background but barely ever went to church but in November of that Year brother gido passed away and brother Isaiah said from that moment his world turned upside down for some reason he stopped drinking instantly a couple months he began to uh they started going to church in a couple months he be to hunger and reading for the word and listening to the message of the hour then in January we had our annual Newport meetings these are the meetings there in Brussels and one night brother Timothy puit preached on born of the fire at the

brother Brown makes a statement in I am the resurrection and the life he goes I believe he's here right now I believe that this feeling that's moving through the church right now like a Milky Way coming over the building I believe the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost because I believe it's the same Holy Ghost I believe down in your heart it's moving just about to make you explode right now I believe that the Holy Ghost is trying to get in this afternoon believe us th this I believe he'll heal every person right now believest thou this he goes let's raise our hands and give him praise Hallelujah send the Holy Ghost through here oh God flow like a rushing Mighty Wind Down the ow touch every heart fill with the faith in Jesus name Hallelujah send the next picture up when we were in Marius I preached on a Saturday night Brother David May preached on the Winds of Pentecost Saturday morning and the power of God struck that building he never made it behind the pulpit and he preached right down there in the grass for over an hour the supernatural anointing of an outpouring of the spirit of God begin to move and begin to deal with hearts and begin to deal with lives and after that service there was a a rush up there and we begin to pray for people but this is Saturday night and I preached on footprints in the land of promise and just we had a prayer line to formed but after the prayer line I come back to the back and you can see here just right here it's all clear but the next picture in just a moment's time all of a sudden the Milky presence of the Holy Spirit began to fall in that place and the place was covered with the Milky present and we find I got a testimony back says brother decent ched's wife sister van she she had some difficulties walking straight and she was very shy and very quiet he goes however that night when the Lord came down she started singing and crying and jumping everyone who saw her was stunned because if that was not the presence of the Lord then there was no explanation the same sister vane who walked with the limp brother she was jumping and praising God and goes and we're still talking about that night and all the Miracles that came with it let me tell you he still God he still fills the place he still fills the sanctuary he still fills Hearts he still fills life he still comes in the Milky Way he's the same God there was a Brother David there in the service for that Saturday morning service when Brother David mayor was preaching this brother's wife begin to come to the altar begin crying out for her family crying out for her husband who was backslid well he wasn't in the service he was actually on his way somewhere else and he got into into an accident and a car struck him and hit him and pushed him into a covert he crashed into a cover and they had to cut the top off of the vehicle to get this man out of the car and the only thing that he had was a is a just a little bruise from the seat belt he was perfectly well at the same time that his wife was up there praying for the family and praying for his soul he G he comes and God spares his life and he comes into that Saturday night service and he walks up there and he rededicates his heart to God I'm telling you that God is still real and the Winds of Pentecost are still blowing let me give you a few more we'll close brother Remy he's another brother there one of the minister Brothers in the church Saturday was a life-changing experience for mostly everyone in the camp that day the presence of the Lord blessed so many people and brother Remy and his family were one of them they left the camp meeting after the bonfire that night and on their way back they were driving about 60 kmet and all of a sudden A car pulled right out in front of him oncoming traffic looking straight at them and he swerved and he I think what they C he drifted and got right to where they were just face to face and he said his wife looked in and all she could see was white hair but when he looked in he didn't see anybody in the driver's seat so he begins to pull out and go around when he look back and instantly he looked back in his rearview mirror and that car vanished and was not there see Satan has said trap but God God intercepted and God still moved and yet we find today he says brother Remy looked and saw nobody in a driver seat the headlights were on he goes it wouldn't he goes it wouldn't have been possible to him not to have seen who was in the driver's seat and the car just turned and when brother Remy looked at the car it had vanished I'm telling you he's the same God today he does the supernatural he's the same in power he's the same in anointing he's the same in every detail Church they had a brother sh a young brother who had stopped coming to church maybe on occasion but his mom got up for Sunday morning she was going to catch a bus to come to the church to be a part of the service there and it was going to take her time and she's like well I may be late so she may not go but she got ready and started out the door anyway and this young boy who didn't come to church mother be to pray for him because he didn't come to the camp meeting and she said he said mom if you'll just wait I'll go with you to the meeting she still got out there he says no she stopped her or she he had stopped her he told her if you'll wait I and I'll I'll take you to the church he she tells me this lady sends me the the testimony says brother Shadel came to church one way got a whole new person he met God personally that day brother he goes the next day he called the pastor and my dad asked for forgiveness for everything that he had done he even sent a message into the youth group with every young person and deacons and preachers on that group he texts and ask for forgiveness for every everyone from Every brother he goes our family visited that brother and his mother he was so blessed he told us that from now on anything that we need to do for the church feel free to contact him he will help whatever way possible he joined the church cleaning team and he comes to all the services and he brings his mama on time I'm here to tell you God's still able to change hearts and lives you may have come into a service one way but you can go out a different way she says our young people started a prayer chain after the Youth Camp Devil's been trying to get a hold of each of us every one of us brother but he's been doing all to tempt us and every every day at 9:00 p.m. our young people join together in prayer and we pray for specific prayers and requests and also for personal CH we are we are waiting for greater things to come and we know all caps we know that there are greater things coming and I'll end with this musicians if you make your way back brother Braham says if your life isn't compared with the book of Acts if the holy spirit that you profess to have is not making you live like they did in the book of Acts and your life could write another book you better take warning you better take warning if the first Vine brought forth a Pentecostal Church the second Vine or
