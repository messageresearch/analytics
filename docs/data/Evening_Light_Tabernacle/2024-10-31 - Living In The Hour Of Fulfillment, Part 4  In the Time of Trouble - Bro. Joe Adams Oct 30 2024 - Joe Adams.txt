at the right time at the right person for the right this this moment that we're in right now father so we just Commit This Time To You Lord we're asking for the spirit of God to move in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to quickly get into this we're not sure how much time we have with the battery back up so if the lights go out well we'll just preach my iPad is lit up you just pull so we're here let's just get into it so we're going to look here in Matthew 24 we're going to pick back up on the line of thinking that I've been on on living in the hour of fulfillment a subtitle tonight is going to be in the time of trouble now I believe we sit under a great ministry brother Tim and he has done an outstanding job bringing these things to our attention and we are people that are uh this will not be new tonight but it should be a refresher to many of us so I just ask that you just get behind it tonight and we'll look at it and see what the Lord has in store for us but we find here Matthew 24 and verse1 says Jesus went out and he departed from the temple and the disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thr down and he sat down upon the Mount of Olives and the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world now I want you to clue in right here for the next portion of this scripture reading verse 4 through verse1 15 and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you that's the first thing then he comes he says for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and shall hear you shall hear Wars and rumors of War see that you are not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for Nations shall rise against Nation the kingdom of against Kingdom there shall be famines there shall be pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows not the end but the beginning then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached to all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end be when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy place he said whosoever readeth let him understand God bless you you can have your seats tonight thank the thank the Lord for the opportunity to be here and we're just going to try to move as quickly because we're not sure how much time we got but if you go back in Daniel 8 and we're not going to go there for the sake of time but just to kind of paraphrase here in Daniel 8:15 Daniel had a vision and he begin to uh Gabriel the angel of God begins to come to Daniel share what this Vision meant and so the vision that Daniel had in Daniel 8 was actually the was the end time destruction it's the tribulation period it's the Abomination that maketh desolation and we go into Daniel 9 it says the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by the books a number of years where of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that we would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem So Daniel Knew by looking back at Jeremiah the prophet when this time should happen and therefore his vision lined up with Jeremiah's prophecy and so because of that Not only was was it just the 70 years that the Jews were going to be in Exile but it also carries on because Daniel was told in the book of uh Book of Daniel chapter 8 he's told seal these things up Daniel for there is certain time appointed they're not for now but they will be for a certain time so I believe what Daniel saw Daniel saw our day Daniel saw a people living out the manifestation of the end time and notice in that end time it's not a flowery bed of ease it's not an easy time it's a struggle of time it's a time of trouble but I want you to know in the time of trouble there's safety for the elect notice when when when egyp was receiving their plagues the uh the Jews of the elect was in Goan so it was Darkness to one but it was light to the other let me tell you the world's groping in darkness but you and I sitting here tonight oh the lights may be off in the building but the light of the Revelation is in our hearts tonight and we see because why God sent us the manifestation of the revelation of his word for the end time yes sir so we find I was going to speak tonight on the consummation but the Lord kind of changed my thought process this morning and we're going to look at it from the aspect of in the time of trouble so I looked at this and I was thinking you know what I don't want to bring them through the consummation and go about all the the details of the end time without first letting you know that there's a way of Escape so I think what we're going to do tonight we're going to look at the end time we're going to look at the Rapture message tonight we're going to look at what's promised for the bride cuz let me tell you destruction is not promised for the bride Annihilation is not promised for the bride let me tell you the tribulation is not promised for the bride but what is Promised for the bride in the time of trouble I will hide you in my Pavilion in the secret of my Tabernacle let me tell you in the time of trouble there's safety for the bride there's peace for the bride there's rest for the bride in the time of trouble hallelujah oh church let me tell you no if you got to look around and wonder oh are we in that time yes we are in that time and it's only going to get worse it's only going to get more uh more more wicked and more evil as the day goes by it's only going to get better you may make your vote on November 4th November 5th it ain't going to change the course of scripture it's not going to change the the plan of Prophecy it's going to manifest just exactly the way the word declares now we find and I talked about this the last time that we spoke we talked about Daniel here is not referring to the Gentiles he's referring to the Jews and you know brother BR would teach us to look at the Jews for they are the time piece they are our time piece notice Daniel's 70 weeks may not pertain to the bride matter of fact the prophet said it doesn't pertain to the Gentiles it doesn't pertain to us so brother Joe why do we look at it because they're your time piece it's just like looking at the clock on the back wall we can tell what time it is right now and how much longer we have before the service is out and we can look at the Jews they are time piece and we can find just how much longer we have before the end time destruction before the 70 weeks as Daniel is fulfilled and the Gentile dispensation is all summed up that's right so we want to look at that tonight and we find here in Revelation 6 and verse 12 says I beheld when he had opened the six seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell upon the Earth even a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it rolled together every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the king of the the Great Men the rich men the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every bondman and every free man they hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and they said to the mountains and the Rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the Lord for the great day of Wrath has come and who shall be able to stand now brother Brandon will tell us just exactly he says in the six seal comparing what Jesus said in Matthew 2 4 speaking about the Abomination that make a desolation he says now Jesus said in Matthew 24 and what the Revelator here opened up in this six H is just exactly Jesus was speaking of the tribulation period he was speaking there's a Time coming and the prophet of God will teach us oh whatever you do make sure that you escape that time if you got to cut my stomach open pulic acid whatever you do make sure that you're not here for that time that's right that's right he says when you see the Abomination that maketh desolation spoken by the Prophet Daniel standing in the Holy place he said what is that he said that's the mosque of Omar stood in the place of the temple where they burned it down let them that's in the mountains let them that's on top of the housetops don't come down to take these things out of the house him that is in the field will return back for there will be a time of trouble yeah let me tell you if you're on offense tonight whether you want to serve God or I want to tell you there will be a time of trouble yeah we are living in that hour where there is nothing left but trouble for all those that reject the coming of the Lord all those that reject the message of the hour all those that reject the serve a living God there's nothing left but destruction my brother Joe can't you paint us a pretty picture I will get there but I want you to know it's not going to be pretty don't be a part of the Left Behind right so we find this Abomination brother said it has a compound meaning it also meant that time of Daniel 70 weeks or the 70 years that they were held in captivity but it also speaks of our day it also speaks of an end time and we find that here we find that the church world has the end time all figured out we find the church world has its own idea of what it's going to be like when the world comes to an end right you know I was in the Baptist Church many years before I came to this message and I remember there was a series Left Behind Kirk Cameron many of you may know that and what you find that they got it all figured out the great theologians of the world they got airplanes falling from the skies so you're telling me every Captain every pilot in those planes or are happen to be Christians they all f with the Holy Ghost and serving the lord that those planes are going to come crashing down they have trains derailing from their track so every train conductor all of a sudden he got the Holy Ghost they have cars crashing into one another they have people Vanishing and one minute they're there the next minute they're gone let me tell you that is not how it's going to be it's going to be just like it was today it's going to be just another day but only thing different you and I won't be here oh Hallelujah I'm might tell you tonight cuz in the time of trouble we got a prophecy in the time of trouble we got a a promise that's right God sent you a Vindicated message to tell you to prepare to look for these things the Rapture of the church will be a secret going away brother BR says in one place he says the world is living as if they're going to come before Jesus comes they're going to make a an announcement on every radio station and on every television everybody get ready we got 30 days the Lord is coming he said it's a secret going away that's right he says you'll not know the hour nor the time but we know when he's coming the hour you think not that's scripture so what's that mean it means every day you need to be making preparation every day you need to be searching your heart searching your spirit searching your soul am I where I need to be if he comes today every morning should be we if if it's the day I'm going to meet the Lord I want to make sure my heart is right with him but they they think that it's just going to be you know all this chaos it may be chaos and then when we're gone oh church but the Rapture you know I remember as a kid I used to be afraid of the word rapture the term Rapture man I had bad dreams about the Rapture but the Rapture is the greatest thing that can ever happen to a Believer that's right the Rapture is our reward for believing and trusting we're going to kind of go through some of these things tonight I'm going to take this off cuz it's warm up here but notice brother ra says now Daniel's 70 weeks so it's a great scripture and it's a great uh uh this whole deal is so wonderful and so great because it shows us the hour in which we're in but he says it has nothing to do with the Gentiles nothing at all to do with it Israel is our time piece he goes if you want to know what time we're living in watch those Jews he says that's the only time piece now let me tell you don't pull your head out of the sand and you don't well I don't want to worry about what's going on over in Israel you need to be concerned about what's going on over there you need to be making sure that you're putting prophecies together because why they're the time piece when we see what's taking place and now Israel has become the burdensome Stone countries is pulled away from her her allies are pulling away from her Joe Biden has already said that she's an extreme country otherwise he saying that Israel is like a terrorist Nation let me tell you that's the nation that God has chose that's right and what God does for Israel in the natural he does for you and I the bride in the Supernatural but we find they turning on her just as well as they're turning on us what do you got this believe the sign they're turning on you those that used to sit right amongst you used to be our allies have now turned on us don't believe the message don't believe the Vindicated prophet in the message of 70 weeks of Daniel brother says to my understanding by the gospel by the holy spirit that the end time God returns again to the Jews do we believe that we know by the gospel that Paul taught and the others that God will return again to the Jews well then if he's going to return again to the Jews how can we apply that back to Daniel's time he goes we got to apply it in the last age and if it's after the Gentile church is gone cuz he deals with Israel as a nation and we as individuals So Daniel 70 weeks is of utmost importance for the body for the bride because we can see exactly we may not know the hour the day the moment but we can see the temperature rising to realize here we are it's time to quit playing it's time to just you know going through the motions has got to be over we got to get more sincere we got to get more dedicated brother B said the coming of the Lord should throw us into desperation desperation what I want to make sure I'm going to make it I don't want to be part of the left behind so we can see how close we are to the filling up of the cup of iniquity by watching Israel by seeing our time piece that's right so we certainly agree that we're not in the beginning of the L de seean age I hope we can certainly agree with that because we find God sends a messenger at the end End of the Age now he didn't send brother Bram at the end of the leoan age he sent him at the end of the Philadelphian age because there's not a messenger coming at the end of the Leo Dean age we received our message the only thing that's left for the bride is the going home of the church it's not to be part of the left behind but before the Lord turns back to the Jews notice what he's going to do he's going to snatch away his bride before he turns back to the Jews she'll be caught up with him and joy ening a wedding supper oh my that's nothing to be fretful about that's nothing to be concerned about you just got to make sure you make it brother Aaron did a great job manifestation of expectations you got to man know manage your expectations to that Lord let me dress myself in the word of God each and every day May my life become pure and clean and may I be a match piece to you and the same things that you did in the previous ages may you live out through my life in this age may I be the reflection of Christ to a dying generation that's who I want to be that's the manifestation of the expectation he's coming for a wife he's coming for a church without spot without wrinkle without blemish I say mama that's me tonight I want to be without spot I want to be without wrinkle I want to be without blemish Lord let your word make me that may I manifest that in this hour he says again now the Gentiles was not a lot at any certain time but the Jews were they had 70 years but we find here in Luke 21 verse 24 they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the Gentiles until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled and then he said says and there shall be signs in the Sun and Moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distressed upon the nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves are roaring men's heart are failing them for fear and for the looking after those things which are coming on the earth for powers of Heaven shall be shaken then shall they see the son of man coming in the cloud with power and great Glory then these things begin to come to pass he says look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh so we find when this end time destruction or the Gentile dispensation is being fulfilled he begins to Jesus begins to go in and tell us the things that are happening in the environment in which we're living in at that time men's hearts are failing them for fear the greatest the greatest uh thing that men face today is heart failure it's not by happen stance that it's heart failure it's fulfilling the scripture but we also find notice notice he says now then you shall see the son of man coming in a cloud let me tell we don't have the picture of the cloud up here it's back there but what was that that wasn't William Brown that was a picture of the son of man coming again in this day what was he doing showing that he is he is uh vindicating this message that wasn't some man's idea that was almighty God fulfilling the scripture that he came in this hour he came in this day to give you faith that you can put your rest in this word heavens and earth will pass away but this word will not pass away that's right the Revelation the prophecies will manifest I say Lord let it manifest through me in a time of trouble let my life manifest the message of the hour yes sir brother B says now in the mark of the beast and the S of God Gentile your days is just about over let me warn you in the name of the Lord Gentile your days is just about over the Gentile door is closed just as certain as I'm standing here we don't have an infinite amount of time Church it could be before we wake up in the morning it could before we get through the weekend it could be before we finish this service tonight but notice he said the Gentile he says your days is just about over let me warn you in the name of the Lord the Gentile door is closing just as certain as I'm standing here he said the muhammadans there would tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation be finished and fulfilled and he says in the spoken word The Original Seed he said God has promised be careful God has promised Malachi 4 for this last day now come on everybody should be say Amen to that well that's our message right Malachi 4 is our ministry is our message he says and Malachi for has not yet been fulfilled now brother Brandon's being humble here he's recognizing he's trying to talk to an audience this is 1962 but he knows who he is but he says it's not been fulfilled yet but it must be fulfilled for it is a gerz word of God spoken through Malachi the prophet Jesus referred to it he said it is to be just before the coming of Christ the second time he says listen close now all scripture has not been fulfilled but must be before that time the Bible is to be finished it is to be finished to G dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives let me tell you we're not in the day that the messenger is still here he has already preached his message and he is gone tell me what day are we living in their hearts of the people have already been turned back so one sign of the Gentile dispensation filling up was the ministry of Malachi 4 it would come first and turn the hearts of the elect back to the faith of the fathers sir that's one Vindication showing you where we are on the calendar of a Rapture so why must the heart of the Gentile bride be turned how many have ever wondered that why must our hearts be turned because she's predestinated to take a Rapture she's the one that's predestinated to take the Rapture you're not taking a Rapture unless your heart is been turned that's right you're not going to receive a body change unless your heart has been turned so we find and brother says this in the church AG he says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things everybody with me tonight all right I know it's kind of a different setting but let's just have it he says one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and the church said amen amen all those that had their heart's turn says amen amen all right we're going to get there notice he says two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers so let me just say this and this if this sounds uh awful then just forgive me but sign and wonders didn't turn our hearts Miracles and the and the display of the supernatural didn't turn our hearts no the signs and wonders the Miracles and the display of Supernatural only caught our attention right but it was the these seals become open and these truths begin to manifest that's what turned our hearts back to the faith see the opening of the seals the revealing of the mystery truths that's what turned because only the bride's heart will be turned back and let me say this tonight if you are a bride no matter what you've been through no matter what kind of hell you've been going through no matter what kind of dirt the devil's put on you no matter what kind of trouble you've been in I want you to know if you got a seed on the inside there ain't enough devils in hell that can keep your heart from turning back God's got a word over it God's got a prophecy over that the elect their hearts will be turned I say hallelujah tonight and if your heart gets turned that means the body's going to take a Rapture Hallelujah tonight Church you got nothing to fear tonight my heart's been turned that's only a foreshadow that my body's going to be changed glory to God oh should give you Faith tonight yes sir the Turning of the heart turn back to the faith not to Creeds and dogmas and ideas of man but to the faith of the father he said Gross Darkness now the blinding of Israel was for the lighting of the Gentiles now the blinding of the Gentiles is the lighting of Israel so we're living in a day as the scripture would say gross Darkness upon the land or Darkness upon the lands gross Darkness upon the people so why is that because God is about to turn back to the Jews so the blinding of the Gentiles the light going out Darkness setting in only means that he's about to go back to the Jews he said and the church is making herself ready been making herself ready for a time it's time for the Rapture come on church I know you've been worried about what this election is going to bring is it going to be camela is she going to be the one to fit the bill let me tell you I'm not worried about camela I don't care if it's Donald Trump I don't care who you put there it ain't going to change the prophecy there's already been a word spoken it's going to get wickeder and wickeder and worse and worse as long as time is here but in a moment in the twinkling of an eye oh there's been a promise spoken over we shall be change there ain't enough devils and hell can keep that scure from coming to pass it don't matter how dark it gets how chaotic it get we will be changed glory to God tonight we're going to put on in corruption oh my my my my I should make an old man shout tonight going to be changed I don't want to get ahead of myself but my that excites me tonight to know we got a promise we got a future oh my the world don't have any hope they don't have any PL but oh what a what a plan we got God has came and showed us the blueprint Hall you know like how we said we done read the back of the book I don't read where we lose that's right come on church I don't read where we lose I read in the end we're taken up that's right we're taking up yes sir oh there ain't enough anything that can take place to stop us from not fitting the bill so we find that all Christian them they recognize that the Rapture is at hand yeah time is at hand something has got to happen you know I got good friends out there you know we all have friends that nominal Believers nominal Christians they can tell you and they will tell you that we're living in the last days there's no way we can continue down the road that we're going indefinitely something's bound to happen and so they're believing for a Rapture they're believing like you're believing for a Rapture but notice see the prophet tell tell us but watch the Jews that's your time piece so they're looking for it and if they're looking for it if they're sensing it if they can feel the atmosphere increasing and it's cultivating into a body change for in elect people what about the elect people shouldn't we be more concerned about the things of God than we are about our YouTube channel than we are about our Tik toks and everything else our social media platforms are be real let me tell you you want to be real be real with God tonight and I'm not throwing off on you to have be real looked you keep do what you want to do with it but I'm just telling you don't let that be your main focus your main focus has got to be I got to be changed I got to look into the mirror of God's word and let myself fit that image wonderful we get so caught up on how many likes I get thank God I don't have that ain't nobody liking no short dumpy fat man okay I got one like two likes man can I get a three can I get a four but we find every the world is recognizing we're at the end and we still at the end we still have people playing church we still not just young we still have some of the older middleaged come oh you know me and my wife were talking the other day and and you say well I come to church that's that's great coming to church is different being in church is different than being in his presence being in church well I go to so and so church that's great but where's the presence of God I want to be in a whether it be a building whether it be a car whether it be in my closet whether it be in my home whether it be in my office wherever it is I want to be where the presence his presence can come down like it came down today when I was studying and it begin to turn my attention away from the consummation and all that's going to befall Us in the end time and begin to push me into the Rapture the Rapture theme tonight to give you you have a hope tonight you have a promise tonight let me tell you let that be your drive let that be your focus not how many likes you get but long as you're like by him tonight brother said God's been running the Jews back into their Homeland which they' been away for 2,000 years while the Gentile was making ready and now the Gentiles has turned Christ on the outside of the church according to Revelations the third chapter he can't even get back in his church there's no place for him to go he's rejected then he says these words and it's time for the Rapture so not only do we see the Jews in their Homeland now we see Christ is on the outside of his church so what do you mean we find here behold I stand at the door and I knock he's not he's a gentleman he's not going to just barge into your life he's going to knock and let you open the door to him see if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and I will Su with him and he with me notice Christ has been put on the outside and now we have in the church system today gays and lesbians standing behind the pulpit preaching what they claim is a the gospel we have gays and lesbians in the congregations when never no desire to change Come As You Are God loves you as you are no he loves you as you are but he expects you to be changed because if it was an Abomination then it's an Abomination again today but however when you look at Revelations 3 and 20 the call wasn't to the church to call was to the individual notice them that will open the door open their heart to him he said I will come in and I will s with him I will dine with him I will break bread with him I will reveal myself to him and he can suck with me that's where we want to be tonight Church we're not going with the masses we're just a small called out little group but he's not on the outside of our church he's not on the outside of our hearts tonight we've accepted him we have opened the door of understanding and say Lord come in and sub with me reveal yourself to me in a great Mighty way he says now don't you remember that as soon as a church goes as soon as the church goes the church goes then the Jews take hold of it and come in but first the next thing in order is not a mighty nation on a national rev Revival amongst the Gentiles the next thing in order is the coming of the kingdom of God the coming of Christ and we're going to go somewhere here in this is recognized in your day in this message very familiar quote for many of us for B says everywhere now there's there's no Revival everybody is complaining ministers are crying I was reading one of the outstanding papers that comes here to the church very fine paper and I know the ad aor and I know the people they're godly people very fine Pentecostal people sat under brother brandman's Ministry or had him there to minister for them these are not just anybody church or anybody people crying out for it he says they're godly people very fine brother and sister Mo of the herald of his coming one of the finest papers on the field The Herald of is coming but they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sound the trumpet how many reads it he says you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's going to be a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yet see they're crying out even back then they were crying and today now the mainstream denominations are crying out for a worldwide Revival I was in ausa Street a couple months back in ausa street right there still today they're still calling for another Revival they saw a display back in the early 1900s and they're waiting every day somebody is in that building praying 24/7 praying for a national Revival but let me tell you it ain't coming church he said they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride Oh by being a Christian they feel the pool of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for a way off in the future to come when it's already happen right by you he said that's the same thing it did in the old days they were believing in the coming of the Messiah they believe that there would be a forerunner come but it was right on them and they didn't know it they didn't recognize they believed there would be a forerunner that would forun the Messiah and they cut his head off they killed their Messiah because it was prophesied that they would be blinded and he says now again he says and the same spirit that spoke through Hosea spoke through John and said the church in the last days would be naked would be blind would they would put them on the outside of the church they failed to see those prophecies fulfilled but being in there they realize that something has got to happen they just don't get it they don't realize much like the Jews of the old times blinded Leo de seea of riches theology hostile with the church hostile toward the message look how hostile the Jews were with John look how hostile they were with Jesus when they was the very one that they claimed that they were looking for see they're crying for a Revival but that Revival will never come see however the Revival that's a church the Revival for the church will never happen because the church has been indicted brother bman indicted the church system he indicted the churches the denominations for rejecting the word of God but why are you here tonight because you didn't reject the word so tonight we find brother man tell us now there's three comings of the Lord the Lord Jesus came first to redeem his bride second to receive his bride and third with his bride so we as the bride we're not looking for a great Revival now hear me out and I want to say this we're not looking for a great Revival we are the Revival come on we are in the bride's Revival we have received the message that's why we can believe for the Supernatural That's why we can believe that cancer is defeated that's why we can believe that particles can come home that's all we can believe in the change of these bodies because we as the bride are in Revival and this revival is going to take us to the change of our bodies we're not looking for a Revival we are the Revival oh Hallelujah come on somebody I'm like that little man over in well to you looking for the Real's Revival I am it that's what the world's got to see when you go to Walmart when when you go to the job when you go to the school you want a Revival you're looking at the Revival God sent you a message God sent a prophet in this day and we're lining up to the word and it's done the supernatural we've got signs and wonders and Supernatural but more importantly we got a life that manifest the word of God we're looking for the day and the hour that we're going to be caught up with him we're looking for the day when these B IES of humiliation and Decay will become new strong and vibrant we're looking for that time well there'll never be another heartache there'll never be another tear shed for a lost loved one we're looking for the time when the wrinkles will come back and it's better than olil of Olay oh my see we're looking we're believing we're trusting what any moment we're going to step into our great reward to be seated with him in his throne oh Church the Bible says he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved he didn't say it was going to be easy but you got a message yes sir that's for told you these things listen what brother R says here in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says when the spiritual bride when she begins to have of a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then again you see how that the scriptures at that time there will be a message sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman the elect oh that's it church that's us why cuz we're lining back up with the word some of you were Methodist some of you were Baptist some of you were Pentecost some of you were this some of you were Sinners but oh let me tell you when you come and begin to line up with the word God sent you a message and he caught that heart of yours and he turned that heart back to the faith of the fathers that's right oh Hallelujah so notice the Jews we're going to start bringing this down I got about 30 minutes we're going to do it everything brother B says everything fell right in their hand how did they do it because Hitler's heart was hardened melini's heart was hardened just like Pharaoh's heart was hardened driving them back into that land so 2500 years the Jews were without a Homeland but God gave them a little sliver of land and said I'll bless you inside that land and let me tell you God has given you a little sliver of the word I'll bless you as long as you stay in the message of the hour outside of that I'm not promised to bless you I'm not going to bless you and brother ra says Abraham when he left the promised land he said they didn't do one Miracle outside of that promised land so we find now that they their hearts were hardened these Hearts were hardened and he said for 40 years they've been coming back into the land and they've been waiting for so notice now the Jews are back in their Homeland and they have been back for 67 years they're not on their way back they are back and they are a great nation they have many capabilities that far exceeds many other countes that little bitty country God has blessed him in that Homeland so wow as we showed the pictures of them coming back the yemenite Jews coming back are you coming back to die to die in your Homeland said no God promised us to take us home on the wings of an eagle we're going home we're going back to the Homeland to meet our Messiah and can I say this to you little bride tonight God has lift lied us up on the wings of a great Eagle a mighty eagle Prophet Ministry let me tell you it ain't to take us and land us somewhere to die out there why don't you bring us so far brother a't just to die out here no we're not just coming so far we're going all the way and can I tell you tonight this message his Eagle wings to the believer and it will lift you up and take you into the presence of the Living God we're not going we didn't come to this message to die and be called a cult and this that but we come back to see our Messiah there'll be change in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and this is the only message that will change your body the Baptist don't have a message the Pentecost don't have a message let me tell you the denominations don't have an answer but we got the answer tonight we got the answer to the devil's question we received the message and it will change us he said God never did deal with Israel till she come to her Homeland hear me thus saith the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the Homeland the message of the hour oh come on put a smile on your face God will not deal with the church until she comes back to her Homeland the message of the hour Baptist ain't the home homel land Pentecost ain't the Homeland Methodist ain't the Homeland wondering out there streaming it ain't the Homeland but God is giv us a word in this hour the message of the hour is the Bri home land and God will bless you if you stay in that word he'll bless you with healing he'll bless you with Deliverance he'll bless you with salvation he'll bless you by bringing the prodical he'll bless you by changing your body in the hom land it takes place in the Homeland so let's start turning the corner here we're at the End of the Age ready for a Rapture 1 Thessalonians 4: 13 but I will not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which I have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died rose again even so then which also sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep right for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout amen and brother says the shout I think we just lost life the shout is the message going forth to call out that's right amen so he says he's going to descend with a shout and he says then he'll come with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air soever shall we be with the Lord so first thing takes place is a shout message have you receive the sh have you heard the shout have you heard the message of the hour came unto it tonight has it changed you and the voice of the Archangel what is the voice doing it's calling out those that's already gone on to the Grave right he say the only thing we're waiting is the Trump and the trumpet always calls for the Feast of the trumpets it's calling the bride to the wedding supper right am amen I don't know it's off it's off that's good we don't need no Vol so notice the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of the trumpets is the calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride supper Oh Come [Music] [Applause] onbody are you listen are you waiting for the trumpet call he said come we've already received the voice we already receiv the sh only thing we're waiting for is the trumpet call he said that's the bride supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky first thing comes forth is a message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones that died back to the other ages they're caught up together and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky why that's the thing that takes place friends he says we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out it's got the laying the sun to right oh Hallelujah the Great come by will come after a while the wheat will be burned the socks but the grain will be gathered to the Garden oh come on Hallelujah are you weak tonight yes 1 Corinthians 15 and verse1 15 now this I say brotherr that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery yes come on we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed [Applause] come on bri we shall not all go down by the way of the Grave some of you right here tonight you're going to be a part of those that are alive and remaining that's right we shall be changed in the moment in the twigling of an eye at the last Trump oh there it is waiting for that trumpet sound again oh for the trumpet shall sound in the dead and Christ shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed Hallelujah that's a promise that's right say you ain't going to make it but the word say I [Applause] will you wake up every morning you see failure you see disappointment but God sees the change start look to the word and see yourself being changed by the words the of the notice he says now can I keep going yeah I can we ain't got no light I mean got no we whatever we going notice he says we're in the Homeland oh that was weak I said we're in the Homeland the Jews are in the homand we're at the End of the Age ready for the Rapture yes sir hujjah ready for the Rapture the Rapture come the church goes up we're caught up to meet him in the air we will all know that the stone that was cut out of the mountain is ready to come at any time and when it comes what does it do it does away with the Gentile age it's all over and God completely quits dealing with them let him that's be filthy be filthy still him that's holy be holy still what does he do then he takes the church the Holy Ghost amen and then the the rapure message he goes do you know that the Protestant and the Catholic Church is predicted in the last days to be blind the same thing to know to the scriptures with Christ on the outside trying to get in because they sayest I'm rich I have need of nothing knowest thou not that thou are miserable poor wretched naked blind and don't know it Revelations 3 there you are back to the blindness again trampling over things of God as if it didn't mean nothing to them sculping and making fun of it that's what the Bible says but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation that's right so the Rapture is a revelation to you brother Tim can't tell you I can't tell you brother brother Aon can't tell you brother Timothy can't tell that you're going to make it you have to be told it's got to be a revelation that my heart has been turned my Nature's been changed my desires have been changed the things I used to do I do no more the desires I used to have I don't have anymore now my desires to the Rapture is a revelation that you've already made it hallelujah hallelujah wonderful but to the church the bride the Rapture the Revelation to her it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rap now he says it is a revelation for the the Revelation is Faith and you cannot have Revelation with without being of Faith so faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that you that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what's been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now Faith that's what faith is it's a revelation of God and the church is built upon the Revelation the whole entire body and how does faith come by hearing that's right so what do you hear every surface that even like Tabernacle you hear Faith being preached you hear Faith being preached to elevate you up you hear great teachings you hear Mysteries you hear deep things of God you also hear things that are simple and things that are basic the fundamental foundations of our faith we bring a great mixture to the body of Christ here all with the aspect of increasing your faith so that you can have faith that you've already made it so the Rapture is not an event people did you hear he me I know we think about one day between 6 and N brother says that in the Rapture message and you hear preachers going around the world well between 6 and9 6 and9 6 and9 6 and9 but he said there'll be two in the field I'll take one and leave one there'll be two in the bed I'll take one I'll leave one he said it's a Universal Event it's not an event it's a people the Rapture is not any certain event it's not any certain time it is a people that has made theirself ready for the change right and it's a revelation to you that when Jesus comes you're going with him you have to have that Revelation that no matter what you face no matter how difficult life is how bad the troubles are and the battles are you're going to be caught up with him do you realize that there there has to be a revelation I mean there has to be a reation true but there has to be a Rapture for God to be complete amen that's right amen has to be a rure now I'm going to slow down just for a second because I don't want you to miss this you realize there has to be a Rapture because God isn't complete without you and brother Brown makes this statement if you were in the fourn knowledge of God then you're becoming a part of God and the only way that you can be a son and daughter of God you had to be a part of God God isn't complete without you oh come on my some of you been worried about purpose some of you been worried am I going to make it God isn't complete without you right he says and when the bride is being called out how he goes how are you going to put it out it's the revelation of the manifestation of the word made truth we're living in the day praise God the revelation of the mystery of himself yes so I'm going to say something the Rapture is the completion of the mystery of himself yeah did you hear what I said the Rapture is the Revelation it is the completion of the mystery of himself for he without us or they without us cannot be made perfect he is not complete without you lord so when he takes his bride he becomes complete every thought that he ever had his finished every every attribute to be a father to be a savior to be a Healer to be a husband everything that he ever had in his thinking is now been made complete that's right because because he raptured his rde Hallelujah notice she's no longer waiting on him now she's with him that's right amen wonderful yes the Rapture is the completion of the mystery of himself hallelujah amen but B says the Rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride remember the Bible the rest of the Dead live Not A Thousand Years the great Rapture if there's not a Rapture friend where we at where we at what are we going to do what age are we living in what promise do we have there's going to be a Rapture the Bible sday will be and it will only be for the elected the elected lady the bride in this day that's pulled out the church is it back on well praise God all right testing it ain't give it a second all right let's keep going and he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him yeah I'm trying to show you this thought that we just spoke about now it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations in the others has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom than it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him yeah that's why you're the completion that's why when he raptures his bride that is the completion of the mystery of God yes everything that God had in his intention in his thoughts in his AC had now been complete when he takes his little bride off the Hallelujah because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him amen amen that's why we're not in the r yeah that's why we're not insane and lost our mind on medication 247 trying to calm our nerves we have a revelation of the Rapture right notice we've received the message we have peace that's surpasses all understanding yes many wonder how we can be so calm in a chaotic age CU we have a message right cuz we have a revelation not just a revelation of who we are but a revelation of where we're going that's right they wonder why you don't get all caught up in politics in this presidential W man that's all you hear all you see is camela and and and the Democratic party and and Donald Trump and the Republican party and this one against the other and now we got one calling the one all the Trump voters garbage and all this kind of stuff we're not caught up in all that I don't care who wins cuz at the end of the day we win that's that's all I'm worried about is we're winning we're going to be translated we're going to be changed we're going to be raptured and we do it take place in the time of trouble amen yes notice the sign of his coming proves that the coming that the coming is right at hand now it could come at any time it don't he goes I don't see nothing to H the Rapture of the church right now amen after the sign was manifested fully to Abraham and his group then the next thing comes was that change hey just now we done seen everything through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost placing of the son the signs and wonders of him being in the presence of theer the thoughts of the heart and so forth he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man we see that taking place right now what was the next thing the change of the body he says now now show that this that we're looking for and expect the son glory is that right we cannot meet him in these bodies if we were changed back to young men and women still we can't meet them because we have to meet them in the air there has to be something done besides changes back to young men and young women we got to be changed and call up in the air to meet him the next thing coming is the rapture of the church and the change of the body of the sleeping Saints to meet the Lord in the end amenu the projectors are still not working on me that's fine we're going to move right on past that I had something to show but we're going to move right on psalms 27 verse one you know where I'm going and we're coming to a close he says the psalm of David the Lord is the light of my salvation yes who shall I fear otherwise What Shall I Fear what sickness what trouble what chaos what man what shall I fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a hoost should Camp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident Hall come on church one thing one thing have I

there he says you know you see the presence of God come down and drop down and and you sit there and you have no response not a tear not a hand not a prayer not anything and yet he said if that's the case and something must be wrong with your soul but let me tell you for those that's going to receive a body change for those that are living in a time of trouble he said I'm going to hide you when all chaos is breaking loose I'm going to hide you in my secret place it's going to be the secret taken away of the little bride of Jesus Christ it's a secret coming it's not a great big announcement

revelation of the Rapture and in the time trouble glory in the time that we're living in now when everybody's against everybody oh everybody takes offense of this that and the other in that time in the most wicked age in the most wicked hour in a time of trouble we have a promise I'm going to hide you yes sir in my Dwelling Place musicians if you would come see he's going to come and he's going

coming amen you don't want to be here during that time you don't want to be a part of those that are left behind and notice what he says here in verse 7 and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies and I will offer in his Tabernacle a sacrifice of Joy some of you find it hard to clap your hands some of you find it hard to worship well let's not my nature what about that body change
