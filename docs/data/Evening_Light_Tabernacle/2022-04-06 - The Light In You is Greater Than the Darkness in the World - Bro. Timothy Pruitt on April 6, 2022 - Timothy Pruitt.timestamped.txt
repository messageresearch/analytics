[42:21] touch your people lord you know the
[42:23] needs that are in the body
[42:24] situations lord we
[42:26] think about
[42:29] the church there in buford today lord
[42:31] even this evening facing tornadoes again
[42:35] i had them this morning when you assess
[42:37] your protection around your people lord
[42:40] god we just ask that you would move lord
[42:43] and your bride all over the world father
[42:45] just the miraculous
[42:47] out break out lord in our midst lord to
[42:50] show you're still the same yesterday
[42:52] today and forever
[42:53] lord we commit our hearts to you we
[42:55] commit our lives to you
[42:57] we thank you for this time together in
[42:59] jesus name
[43:01] amen
[43:04] amen let's turn to zechariah 14 and
[43:06] verse 6.
[43:08] amen it's always good to be in the house
[43:10] of the lord amen we're coming up very
[43:13] quickly just a week away from
[43:15] leaving to go down to prepare for the
[43:17] youth camp that'll be starting on
[43:19] thursday so
[43:20] just keep that in your prayers
[43:22] it's kind of a
[43:25] almost a reboot for us because there's a
[43:27] lot of things that are different but
[43:29] we're looking forward to a wonderful
[43:30] time in the lord
[43:32] and uh
[43:33] yeah that wins next wednesday night
[43:35] there will not be service here nor the
[43:37] following sunday
[43:38] so it'll be down there at the youth
[43:41] camp in dry creek in louisiana
[43:45] amen zechariah 14 and verse 6
[43:48] and it shall come to pass in that day
[43:51] that the light shall not be clear nor
[43:53] dark
[43:54] but that's but it shall be one day which
[43:57] shall be known to the lord
[43:59] not a day nor night
[44:01] but it shall come to pass
[44:03] that at the evening time it shall be
[44:06] light
[44:07] amen we'll let you be seated
[44:14] amen i'd like to speak to you on the
[44:16] light
[44:18] that is in you
[44:19] is greater than the darkness that's in
[44:21] the world
[44:23] amen how many believes that today
[44:25] amen as we've been speaking about light
[44:27] we know
[44:28] that light is always greater than
[44:30] darkness darkness is never greater than
[44:33] light it don't i mean darkness can come
[44:36] together it can try to put out light but
[44:37] if you could just strike a match or even
[44:40] the weakest light it'll draw it'll push
[44:42] back the darkness but i thought it was
[44:44] very wonderful and this is scripture
[44:46] that we're very familiar here with this
[44:49] church because of our our church being
[44:51] named even in light tabernacle uh it was
[44:54] done for a purpose because i believe
[44:56] that we are to be a light in the
[44:58] community that we're in and and you know
[45:00] uh but it the scripture as it says it it
[45:03] shall be light
[45:05] it shall be light this is not a maybe or
[45:08] a might be or a hope fully will be or
[45:11] maybe it'll work out or possibly but it
[45:14] is a confirmation it's an assurity it's
[45:17] a promise it shall be light that no
[45:20] matter how dark it may get no matter how
[45:22] dreary it may be no matter how
[45:25] how whatever may happen he said it was
[45:27] going to be that
[45:28] that kind of day it'd be a day of
[45:30] darkness should be a day of dreariness a
[45:33] day that many people could not see a day
[45:35] that many would grope in darkness
[45:37] someday that
[45:39] you know they would there would be a lot
[45:41] of problems upon the earth and
[45:42] situations but it shall be light this is
[45:46] actually the same the same words and the
[45:48] same things as let there be light amen
[45:52] that god would speak it and now today we
[45:55] witness the promise being fulfilled
[45:57] although when he spoke it it may have
[45:59] laid for millions of years thousands of
[46:01] years may it happen in just a moment i
[46:03] don't know but that word no matter how
[46:05] long it took as far as time because god
[46:08] he didn't care about time he's not a
[46:09] time being but as far as the way we
[46:12] compute
[46:13] know however however long that it took
[46:15] it did not matter what mattered is
[46:17] there's a sun today there's stars today
[46:19] there's a word that's been fulfilled and
[46:22] you know just as the promise and this
[46:24] this is also a promise that our seed
[46:27] that is laying in darkness there's going
[46:29] to be a light to bring it forth amen
[46:32] that we won't remain in darkness because
[46:35] you know the seed goes into the ground
[46:36] and and it lays there in dark times and
[46:39] dark places amen and it takes the sun to
[46:41] pull it and so it's speaking of a light
[46:44] that's going to pull you out of darkness
[46:46] it's going to pull you out of the things
[46:49] that you're laying in just as the
[46:51] promises of deliverance of a savior laid
[46:53] in scripture and seem you know they
[46:55] would never come to life the word had
[46:58] laid dormant for thousands of years
[47:00] seemed like but all of a sudden the
[47:02] light shone upon it and it came forth
[47:04] and he came forth as a from a virgin
[47:07] amen and a virgin born body and he he
[47:10] came to live he came to defeat satan he
[47:13] he came to die but he also came to rise
[47:15] again so that his power could be
[47:18] transferred not just in one body but in
[47:21] many bodies that not only he could have
[47:23] the light but he would also share the
[47:26] light because he wanted more than one
[47:28] candle he wanted one more than one light
[47:30] bulb he wanted more than one beam of
[47:32] light he wanted many rays of light he
[47:35] wanted god moving in every facet of
[47:37] every part of the world amen he couldn't
[47:39] do that in one body so what did he do he
[47:42] went down and he went he died he went to
[47:44] hell he rose again so that his life
[47:47] could be transferred to other bodies so
[47:50] those bodies could go into that light
[47:53] can be transferred into 120 that was
[47:55] there on in the day of pentecost and
[47:57] they could go to this site over here and
[47:59] they could go over there they could go
[48:01] to this country and the gospel would
[48:03] begin to spread and the light will begin
[48:05] to shine in all the corners of the earth
[48:07] and that's why he could say i will have
[48:09] a bride without spot without wrinkle
[48:12] i'll have a people out of every kindred
[48:14] out of every tongue out of every nation
[48:16] out of every people amen because he knew
[48:18] that that light was going to go forth
[48:21] and no matter what country it came to no
[48:23] matter what government it can't come on
[48:25] somebody no matter what problems arose
[48:27] you could put the red curtains you could
[48:29] put the communist curtain you can put
[48:30] the bamboo curtain you can put the iron
[48:32] curtain you can put whatever curtain you
[48:34] want to put up god's word god's light
[48:37] was going to go through it it was going
[48:39] to get to that seed that laid there upon
[48:41] the earth amen so that seed can come
[48:43] forth see he came to redeem he came to
[48:46] bring life to these predestinated seas
[48:49] that god had seen before the foundation
[48:51] of the world and he wrote their names in
[48:54] the book of life i'm thankful that i've
[48:56] already been seen of all my name's
[48:58] already been written down and and so he
[49:00] knew he had seeds laying in this great
[49:03] darkness that we're living in he knew in
[49:05] the darkest times in the darkest places
[49:08] and the darkest corners of the earth
[49:10] there would be a seed there and somehow
[49:12] light was going to have to get there for
[49:14] that seed to come forth so light would
[49:16] have to go into a body of flesh and be
[49:19] carried and be moved into places on
[49:22] ships or in airplanes through books
[49:24] however it went light was being
[49:26] transferred so it could go to every seed
[49:29] that is laying there because every seed
[49:32] that's written on the lamb's book of
[49:33] life will come up
[49:36] there shall be light in the evening time
[49:39] amen so every seed no matter how dark it
[49:42] may seem no matter how many obstacles
[49:44] there are no matter how terrible the
[49:46] government is no matter how hard they
[49:48] try to push it down and keep it down
[49:50] that seed if it's laying inside of there
[49:53] whether it be in russia north korea
[49:55] south korea japan and the furthest parts
[49:58] of the earth that light is going to find
[50:00] that sea
[50:01] because that seed must come forth amen
[50:04] so the devil can try everything he wants
[50:07] to he can try to put every kind of sin
[50:09] on it he can try to cover it up he can
[50:11] try to put it in the worst muck he can
[50:13] make it so deep and so dark and so
[50:16] impossible but when that light begins to
[50:18] shine it's calling forth the life of
[50:21] that seed and that seed will come up so
[50:25] he came but brother was saying like this
[50:27] he said he came not only to be the
[50:29] blessing he came to share the blessing
[50:34] hallelujah he came not only to be the

[50:46] predestinated seed how many
[50:47] predestinated seeds we got here tonight
[50:49] amen so he came to share his blessing
[50:52] with you he said now if the seed wasn't
[50:54] on the earth it could not live so it had
[50:56] to be on the earth and be germatized no
[50:59] matter how long it's kept in darkness no
[51:01] matter how bad it seems when the s-o-n
[51:04] begins to shine on it it'll come up he
[51:06] came to share it with us
[51:09] he came to share his life with us he
[51:12] came to share his light with us amen
[51:15] whatever was in that life every blessing
[51:17] that was in that life he came to share
[51:20] it with us

[59:31] unrest and all the things that's been
[59:33] going on for the last couple of years

[59:37] but god's not surprised by it
[59:39] he knew it would be there but he said
[59:41] there shall be light
[59:45] so the devil can how the devil can blow
[59:47] he can say i'm going to blow it in with
[59:49] my my chinny chin chin i'm going to do
[59:52] everything i can to put out the bride's
[59:54] life he'll never put it out
[59:57] he can't put it out because there's a
[59:59] word that said that resists him that
[1:00:02] stands between you and the devil there
[1:00:05] shall be light
[1:00:08] why don't you look at that devil tonight
[1:00:10] and say devil you can't put me out

[1:00:40] risen from the dead

[1:01:43] christ

[1:01:47] we're getting them to a church

[1:01:53] be able to light up
[1:01:57] he's the only one that can light up
[1:01:58] their lives
[1:02:00] that can put that light in them like you

[1:02:07] one of them lights entered into human
[1:02:09] bodies amen to push back darkness and
[1:02:12] they have to be the same way today and
[1:02:15] he said if the blood of a man was a
[1:02:16] certain type and he took the blood from
[1:02:18] another man and changed the blood of
[1:02:19] another he would absolutely be that same
[1:02:21] type of blood he said if your spirit
[1:02:22] that's in you is wrecking dead and
[1:02:24] you're anointed with the life that was
[1:02:26] in christ amen it's the same spirit that
[1:02:29] raised him up from the dead will also

[1:02:35] life those same powers those same
[1:02:37] beneficiaries that he had here on earth

[1:07:34] there had never been a time to that time
[1:07:36] a man could lay his life down and pick
[1:07:38] it up again he defied the scientific
[1:07:41] proof they had by raising again and when
[1:07:44] they saw that jesus christ
[1:07:46] when they say when they say jesus christ
[1:07:49] isn't the same yesterday today and
[1:07:50] forever or his power isn't the same or
[1:07:53] his gospel isn't the same when the bible
[1:07:55] says it's the same
[1:07:58] amen god defied every denomination every
[1:08:00] creed and he moved forth with his holy
[1:08:03] spirit as he promised and he's proved to
[1:08:05] us once again he
[1:08:07] is alive
[1:08:09] the light is still shining and we are
[1:08:11] benefactors of that resurrection
[1:08:15] quickened after being dead in the world
[1:08:17] and sins and trespasses has quickened us
[1:08:20] together in him in christ jesus
[1:08:22] his spirit brings his same life again on
[1:08:24] the earth if the spirit of god that
[1:08:26] raised up christ that body that anointed
[1:08:29] body the spirit of god anointed that
[1:08:31] body in such a way that the seed fell on
[1:08:33] the earth he wouldn't just let him rest
[1:08:34] there he quickened him and raised him up
[1:08:37] that same spirit by the same works by
[1:08:39] the same power by the same signs being
[1:08:42] you it'll also raise you up
[1:08:46] hallelujah
[1:08:48] hallelujah we ain't got to worry about
[1:08:49] death there's a power greater than death

[1:09:22] he was brought up before the people amen
[1:09:25] waved as the first one to come to
[1:09:27] maturity

[1:10:56] up from the dead is to be waived over
[1:10:58] the congregation
[1:11:00] that we are his seeds
[1:11:02] that the first of the seeds of those who
[1:11:04] slept waved up on the first day of the
[1:11:06] week on the sunday s-o-n he raised up
[1:11:10] waved goodbye
[1:11:13] and ascended upon high in the presence

[1:13:16] worship you
[1:13:24] he's the first one up
[1:13:26] but he ain't the only one
[1:13:30] there's more coming
[1:13:33] he was the first one up but there's a
[1:13:35] caring prayer that's got to come up
[1:13:37] and
[1:13:38] there's there's the loved ones all down
[1:13:39] to the ages that's going to come up he
[1:13:42] was one but he ain't the only one
[1:13:45] hallelujah
[1:13:46] and we're all going to join together and
[1:13:48] have a goodbye ceremony
[1:13:52] while this world tumbles over into
[1:13:53] complete utter darkness
[1:13:56] because the light is no longer there
[1:14:05] first corn of god's weed had been raised
[1:14:07] from the dead
[1:14:08] god's first corn of wheat by god's
[1:14:11] quickening power god had quickened his
[1:14:12] life raised him up from the dead he was
[1:14:15] the first fruits of those that slept
[1:14:18] that's why they had to waive that sheaf
[1:14:20] for is the first one to come to maturity
[1:14:22] it was waived as a memorial of
[1:14:24] thanksgiving to god believing
[1:14:27] and saying the rest of them will come
[1:14:32] there shall be light
[1:14:38] so he took that scripture and he just
[1:14:40] waves it
[1:14:42] there shall be light
[1:14:44] and he weighs it right in the face of
[1:14:46] the devil i said it right here devil
[1:14:50] right there in zechariah go look it up
[1:14:51] for yourself there shall be light
[1:14:54] and ain't nothing you can do about it
[1:14:58] you can huff and you can blow
[1:15:01] but i want you to know this house is
[1:15:03] built more than wood and straw and
[1:15:04] bricks
[1:15:05] this house has been built by the power
[1:15:07] of the holy ghost
[1:15:10] and you come against it once and lost
[1:15:11] you come again you're going to lose
[1:15:13] every time
[1:15:17] today because he's the first son of god
[1:15:19] to come to full maturity he was plucked
[1:15:21] up from the earth and waved over the
[1:15:23] people oh what a glorious lesson by the
[1:15:25] quickening power the first one although
[1:15:26] he'd been tight many times many times
[1:15:29] with the bible but now he's the first he
[1:15:31] was waved on the day of pentecost when
[1:15:33] there came a sound from heaven like a
[1:15:34] wave in mighty rushing wind he was waved
[1:15:37] over the people the pentecostal people
[1:15:39] that was up there at pentecost waiting
[1:15:40] for the blessing to come and it'll be
[1:15:43] waved again
[1:15:46] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:15:50] because as waved as the first one to
[1:15:52] come the seed went into the ground and
[1:15:54] the seed goes through all the process of
[1:15:56] the seed the blade the sugar all the way
[1:15:58] up to being seed again
[1:16:01] there shall be light
[1:16:04] so there's going to be another harvest
[1:16:06] just like he was
[1:16:10] another people just like he is
[1:16:15] christ was the first one to raise up of
[1:16:17] all the prophets
[1:16:19] although tight many places he was the
[1:16:21] first fruits of those that slept and the
[1:16:22] bride coming to christ coming out of the
[1:16:24] church they'll have to be a sheaf waved
[1:16:26] again in the last days a waving of the
[1:16:28] sheaf
[1:16:30] we've seen it we saw him amen the son of
[1:16:32] man waved before the people
[1:16:35] he's here again doing the same sign same
[1:16:38] wonder same everything same light
[1:16:46] just listen again brother branham
[1:16:47] talking about the light there in houston
[1:16:50] and all the things that took place
[1:16:53] and how the he you know didn't wouldn't
[1:16:55] want to argue and brother bosworth being
[1:16:57] a real soldier just said hey i can't
[1:16:59] take this somebody got to say something
[1:17:03] he said well you just don't argue i
[1:17:05] don't argue
[1:17:08] he walks up there with one at one
[1:17:09] question
[1:17:16] and the man couldn't answer his one
[1:17:17] question
[1:17:19] one question he starts fussing and i you
[1:17:22] didn't even answer me one question
[1:17:26] brandon was sitting up in the back
[1:17:28] and his wife his brother just said hey
[1:17:30] you stay here so i'm not going nowhere
[1:17:32] but he said all of a sudden he felt that
[1:17:34] presence began to whirl
[1:17:36] he said go up there
[1:17:38] and he goes up there
[1:17:40] and he begins to talk
[1:17:42] begins to speak say a few things
[1:17:45] but bosworth made i believe was made a
[1:17:47] good point about it you know you're you
[1:17:49] call yourself a uh you know you you you
[1:17:51] preach the gospel to save soul do you
[1:17:53] call yourself a divine savior well
[1:17:56] neither does brother branham call
[1:17:57] himself a divine healer
[1:18:00] but the man wasn't there for the truth
[1:18:01] he was there only to argue
[1:18:04] he wasn't there for light he was there
[1:18:06] for darkness
[1:18:09] brother branham comes up
[1:18:10] the man begins to take pictures and
[1:18:12] things
[1:18:14] and all of a sudden a light shone they
[1:18:16] took that picture went back and all the
[1:18:19] pictures of that man i believe he had
[1:18:20] him brother bosworth's face of his
[1:18:22] finger in his face shaking it i think
[1:18:25] about five or six pictures none of them
[1:18:27] none of them came up
[1:18:29] every one of them turned out blank there
[1:18:30] was only one picture that came out and
[1:18:33] that was that light
[1:18:35] hanging over that man's head
[1:18:37] listen the picture is not about the man
[1:18:39] the picture's about the light
[1:18:44] but it's very important that that light
[1:18:45] seem fit to have his picture with that
[1:18:47] man
[1:18:53] and here he is
[1:18:55] and i thought god
[1:18:58] how many pictures the devil's trying to
[1:19:00] take of us
[1:19:03] and he tried to take him and if us in
[1:19:05] this situation us in that situation us
[1:19:07] in this situation all of a sudden a
[1:19:09] light comes down
[1:19:12] changes us and he took a picture
[1:19:14] and he goes back to his laboratory he's
[1:19:16] like oh i got proof what he what i got
[1:19:18] proof of who he is i got proof of all
[1:19:21] kinds of stuff i got proof he smoked i
[1:19:23] got proof he drank i got proof he went
[1:19:25] out with women i got proof i got proof i
[1:19:26] got
[1:19:27] where's my proof
[1:19:31] where's my proof
[1:19:32] none of them's come out no i'm showing
[1:19:34] none of them's there
[1:19:37] there's nothing but this light
[1:19:39] there's nothing but a picture of lives
[1:19:44] hallelujah you ain't got to worry about
[1:19:46] what the devil's got proof on you god's
[1:19:49] got an answer for his proof it's called
[1:19:52] the blood of jesus
[1:19:54] it'll turn every picture dark
[1:19:57] it'll turn it all away he'll never find
[1:20:00] it
[1:20:01] it's all been erased
[1:20:05] but there will be a picture a light that
[1:20:07] is shining upon you and saying son you
[1:20:10] don't belong there daughter you don't
[1:20:11] belong there come up hither
[1:20:14] get out of that darkness get out of that
[1:20:16] situation and come to the light
[1:20:21] it's a very important picture to me
[1:20:25] waving to the chief
[1:20:27] he waved over the time over the people
[1:20:29] and he said for the first time they'll
[1:20:32] come forth for the bright age for
[1:20:34] uh for a resurrection out of dark
[1:20:36] denominationalism
[1:20:38] will be a message
[1:20:40] that the full maturity of the word has
[1:20:42] turned back in its full power
[1:20:48] not quarter power half power three
[1:20:51] quarter power full power
[1:20:54] and being waved over the people by the
[1:20:57] same signs and wonders that he did back
[1:20:59] there because i live ye live also
[1:21:02] speaking to his wife
[1:21:05] because i live ye live also what a
[1:21:07] resurrection that was but what a
[1:21:10] resurrection this is
[1:21:12] hallelujah to be quaking from the dead
[1:21:15] to me being alive in christ jesus by
[1:21:17] god's quickening power he was waved to
[1:21:20] them the word which he was was way back
[1:21:22] on the day of pentecost and the word was
[1:21:25] made manifest in bodies
[1:21:33] brother branham would go into the
[1:21:34] dynamics and the mechanics it's a good
[1:21:37] study go study it
[1:21:40] he always preached got to have the
[1:21:42] mechanics but you got to have the
[1:21:44] dynamics
[1:21:45] matter of fact he would say even this
[1:21:47] message says we have we have kind of set
[1:21:49] down on the mechanics and not enough on
[1:21:51] the dynamics
[1:21:53] he said it takes both
[1:21:55] it takes the spark it takes the movement
[1:21:57] of the spirit it takes it all it takes
[1:21:59] the word work and it takes every bit of
[1:22:01] it
[1:22:02] amen for the power to be there you can
[1:22:04] have a positive and not have the
[1:22:06] negative and you ain't got no light
[1:22:08] you can have a negative and not no
[1:22:09] positive you don't have any light you
[1:22:11] have to have both of them working
[1:22:12] together
[1:22:15] amen so if you find a church that
[1:22:16] believes only the new testament don't
[1:22:18] believe the old you don't have any light
[1:22:21] if you find one vice versa you don't
[1:22:23] have any light it takes both of them
[1:22:24] working together because the jehovah of
[1:22:27] the old is the jesus of the new
[1:22:29] amen
[1:22:30] amen so it takes everything working to
[1:22:32] bring forth life and to bring forth
[1:22:35] light not just light but light in full
[1:22:38] power
[1:22:42] it'll make the car go down the road
[1:22:44] the dynamics of the holy ghost
[1:22:47] moving on the people
[1:22:49] amen he would go into other places it
[1:22:51] said i've been seeing churches churches
[1:22:52] bride bride churches bride brought but
[1:22:54] there's got to come one
[1:22:56] there's got to come a real bride
[1:23:01] that there must be one that's not only
[1:23:04] got the mechanics but the dynamics that
[1:23:06] makes the church live to move in the
[1:23:09] power of his resurrection until we come
[1:23:11] that place until we come to that moment
[1:23:13] what good does it do to polish the hubs
[1:23:16] what good does it do to give it a
[1:23:17] facelift for or simonize or wax job when
[1:23:21] there's no dynamics in it
[1:23:23] when there's no moving no spark no no
[1:23:26] lighting of the candle nothing taking
[1:23:28] place what's the use in it
[1:23:34] what he proved
[1:23:35] what easter proved he wasn't only the
[1:23:37] word
[1:23:38] but he was also the dynamics
[1:23:42] he made that body
[1:23:44] that dynamic power the holy ghost made
[1:23:46] that body of jesus cold stiff and dead
[1:23:48] in the grave shake the life and rise
[1:23:50] again and roll away the stone and say i
[1:23:52] am he that was dead
[1:23:54] but i'm alive forevermore all nature had
[1:23:57] said that star said moon said it but now
[1:23:59] the whole world has to recognize he's
[1:24:02] alive again he's not only the mechanics
[1:24:04] god's word he's also the dynamics
[1:24:08] he's also the power moving in the church
[1:24:11] power of his father he said the bride
[1:24:14] amen he said be in the he be in the
[1:24:15] groom the bride has come got to come
[1:24:17] forth it can only be the manifestation
[1:24:19] of the fulfilling of all revelations of
[1:24:21] any other has spoken of the bride it can
[1:24:23] only manifest if it does something
[1:24:25] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:24:28] bride
[1:24:30] hello somebody if it has some revelation
[1:24:33] different than what the groom has it
[1:24:35] isn't the bride
[1:24:37] it might be foolish virgin it might be
[1:24:40] lost
[1:24:41] but it isn't the bride
[1:24:45] because she's flesh of his flesh
[1:24:48] she's born of his bone she's life of his
[1:24:51] life she's power of his power she is him
[1:24:54] and as a man and woman or one a man a
[1:24:57] woman taken from his side she was taking
[1:24:59] taking the spirit of the feminist spirit
[1:25:00] from him the flesh from his side made
[1:25:02] both mechanics and dynamics the wife the
[1:25:05] spirit of him and the flesh of him put
[1:25:07] together makes both mechanics and
[1:25:10] dynamics until that church becomes both
[1:25:14] dynamics and mechanics the spirit of god
[1:25:17] that moved him to do things like he did
[1:25:19] if he hit on all 16 cylinders so will
[1:25:22] the bride
[1:25:23] if he healed the sick so will a bride
[1:25:27] if we're lost we're saved in his
[1:25:28] ministry so will the lost be saved in
[1:25:31] the bride's ministry
[1:25:33] if the blind were healed and the lame
[1:25:35] would walk so will it happen in the
[1:25:37] bride
[1:25:40] if it ain't it's another body
[1:25:47] let's go on down really quick
[1:25:49] first john 4
[1:25:51] first one beloved believe not every
[1:25:52] spirit
[1:25:54] but try the spirits whether they are of
[1:25:57] god
[1:25:58] because many false prophets are going

[1:28:43] that light is greater than anything the
[1:28:45] doctor says it's greater than anything
[1:28:47] the devil says is greater than anything
[1:28:50] that you're dealing with in your body
[1:28:56] the god of this world

[1:31:27] light will put it out
[1:31:28] you can take as much darkness you want
[1:31:30] to try to stand against light one time
[1:31:32] see what happens the one that's in you
[1:31:34] is light and the one that's in the world
[1:31:36] is darkness so the light has proved it
[1:31:39] has overcome the darkness and the man
[1:31:42] that's in christ knows that he has
[1:31:44] overcome the things of this world it has
[1:31:47] no more ties to you
[1:31:50] you are free you're walking in the light
[1:31:53] as he is in the light the blood of jesus
[1:31:55] christ has cleansed us from all sin and
[1:31:58] we have fellowship one with another
[1:32:00] there you are he that's in you is
[1:32:02] greater than he that's in the world
[1:32:07] now if you look back
[1:32:08] and you look back that away you're
[1:32:10] condemned
[1:32:11] you're still in the world but if you're
[1:32:12] living above that he that's in you is
[1:32:15] greater than he that's in the darkness
[1:32:21] i've said this before i ain't scared of
[1:32:23] the dark i'm scared of the things in the
[1:32:24] dark
[1:32:25] but in this situation if he's in you you
[1:32:27] ain't got to be scared of the darkness
[1:32:29] nor what's in the dark
[1:32:32] hallelujah because he's above the
[1:32:33] darkness of the muddy waters he's above
[1:32:35] the darkness of sickness he's above the
[1:32:38] darkness of sin and situations he's
[1:32:40] above the darkness of trials and so he's
[1:32:43] oh i feel like a shouting christian what
[1:32:45] what what was in there by god at the
[1:32:47] beginning it pressed its way through
[1:32:49] overcome talking about the lily now it
[1:32:52] overcome it overcome the shell it
[1:32:54] overcome the mud it overcome the waters
[1:32:56] it overcome everything it was an
[1:32:58] overcomer and it reflected the beauty
[1:33:01] and glory of almighty god that's the way
[1:33:03] every believer does
[1:33:06] it overcomes a shell it
[1:33:10] what's the shell you're human flesh
[1:33:13] amen that wants to hold you back with
[1:33:15] your anxieties and your complexes it'll
[1:33:18] overcome all of that
[1:33:21] it overcomes the mud
[1:33:23] that the devil try to pile on you it
[1:33:26] overcomes the stormy waters
[1:33:29] and light is pulling it out of that
[1:33:31] darkness
[1:33:32] he says the way ever believers would do
[1:33:34] this way no it did lot did that's the
[1:33:35] way moses did joseph joshua did daniel
[1:33:38] did chad write me shaq and i bet no go
[1:33:40] did john the baptist did zacharias
[1:33:42] elizabeth simon anna simeon
[1:33:45] peter james john
[1:33:49] martin luther wesley
[1:33:53] pentecostal fathers
[1:33:55] paul
[1:33:57] william branham
[1:33:59] it's proved it over and over
[1:34:02] it proved over and over the light is
[1:34:04] greater than the darkness
[1:34:07] in the darkest what they call the
[1:34:09] the medieval times or the the
[1:34:12] what's the name i'm looking for the dark
[1:34:14] times dark ages there we are
[1:34:16] dark ages where they would actually take
[1:34:20] little babies
[1:34:21] rip them out of their mom
[1:34:23] and dash them against the stone
[1:34:26] that light was greater
[1:34:31] you're looking at me like an ox looking
[1:34:33] at a new gate
[1:34:34] it was greater
[1:34:36] they could stand it
[1:34:39] the light that was given them
[1:34:41] that ox anointing that fell on them
[1:34:44] that light for their age was greater
[1:34:48] it proved it
[1:34:50] it was powerful
[1:34:52] it was so powerful that they could stand
[1:34:54] there and look at those atrocities
[1:34:57] and would not deny
[1:35:01] they could see the fire coming up on the
[1:35:04] as they went up the logs and things had
[1:35:06] put against them and and they would not
[1:35:08] and they could phillips start burning
[1:35:10] their legs and it would not it'd come on
[1:35:12] up into their bodies and they would not
[1:35:14] he would consume their whole body and
[1:35:15] they would not deny
[1:35:17] that's how powerful that light shone in
[1:35:19] that dark age
[1:35:21] under the ox anointing amen it went all
[1:35:23] the way through the ages don't you know
[1:35:25] that the light is the way it we're back
[1:35:27] again to what it was in the beginning
[1:35:31] that the light that is shining now is
[1:35:33] powerful enough if it held them through
[1:35:35] what they went through it'll surely hold
[1:35:38] you through what you're going through
[1:35:49] somebody said this other day is a joke
[1:35:51] but
[1:35:52] listen
[1:35:54] you think you're going you're having a
[1:35:55] bad day and leo to sick oh go read the
[1:35:57] fox's book of martyrs
[1:36:02] and you see them men
[1:36:04] and women
[1:36:05] that stood the challenges of the
[1:36:07] darkness of their age
[1:36:09] why because of a great light
[1:36:12] it was greater than the darkness
[1:36:14] and do you think he's going to allow you
[1:36:16] to get to this age as darkest age
[1:36:18] spiritually
[1:36:19] so dark
[1:36:21] that the light ain't going to be great
[1:36:22] enough
[1:36:23] the lighting will be big enough
[1:36:25] that it can't take a teenager and lift
[1:36:27] them up out of the darkness area and
[1:36:30] make them shine before others
[1:36:33] he'll do it every time
[1:36:36] the devil's a howl the devil's a blow
[1:36:38] the devils are trying to stomp it out
[1:36:40] put it out well bye and i tell you what
[1:36:42] they got something over there at that
[1:36:44] camp in oklahoma by easter i'm gonna
[1:36:46] have them out but they're still shining
[1:36:50] well let's get a few more devils
[1:36:53] let's bring them on we got one week left
[1:36:55] and they're still shining
[1:36:57] because you don't realize this ain't a
[1:36:59] temporary light
[1:37:00] and this ain't a light that he can do
[1:37:02] anything with this ain't a light he can
[1:37:05] stop this ain't a fire he can put out
[1:37:09] this is a fire that's been come off the
[1:37:11] coals of the altar that's fell upon a
[1:37:13] body and it lit them amen with eternal
[1:37:16] life and eternal life there ain't
[1:37:18] nothing the devil can do about it
[1:37:22] we can have 10 more easters and they'll
[1:37:24] still be shining
[1:37:26] we can have 20 more years and they'll
[1:37:29] still be shining why it's a light that
[1:37:32] won't go out
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:36] there's a light that's greater than the
[1:37:38] darkness
[1:37:41] jesus showed what power that was in him
[1:37:43] when he come up out of that water and
[1:37:45] went up to be tempted of the devil
[1:37:47] he showed you what that light can do
[1:37:49] 40 days he was tempted come against him
[1:37:52] three times and every time he stood it
[1:37:55] was showing that light is greater than
[1:37:57] the darkness
[1:37:58] that light is greater than satan's
[1:38:00] options
[1:38:02] i kind of let that one sink a little bit
[1:38:04] that light is greater than satan's
[1:38:06] options
[1:38:07] that light is greater than satan's
[1:38:09] excuses that light is greater than
[1:38:12] satan's
[1:38:13] his wants and his will for your life
[1:38:15] that light is greater

[1:38:24] if i can find it
