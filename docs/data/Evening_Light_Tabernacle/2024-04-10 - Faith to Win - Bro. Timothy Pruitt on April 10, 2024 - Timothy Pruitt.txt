you called us to be we just ask Lord you be with us Lord this evening and this service father we've already felt your presence Lord we ask Lord you just begin to move among us even more and touch hearts and lives we pray we give it all to you in Jesus name amen amen let's turn to Luke chapter 14 amen verse 25 amen so there went a great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto him unto them if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sister yay in his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower Seth not down first and count the cost whether you have sufficient to finish it less happenly after you've laid the foundation and is not able to finish it and all that be behold begin to mock him saying this man be to build and was not able to finish or what king go to war make war against another king sth not down first and consult us whether he be able to with 10,000 to meet him that cometh against him with 20,000 or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage and desireth conditions of Peace So likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple amen we let you be seated this evening like to speak to you on faith to win amen I believe we are winners and I believe that's what we've been sitting here to do you know I I just reading this scripture Jesus speaking about a man who to intended to build a tower and Seth not down first and cth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it l happily after he laid the foundation is not able to finish all that behold to be behold it began to mock him and you know a mind goes to that church that's been been sitting there on the side of the road there just going between men and C how many wonder how many has wondered why it's sitting in the condition that it's sitting unfinished and you know the scaffold's been put up and the Rocks been laid and the bricks been done different things but it's slowly rotten him back down because it was never finished and I I believe that he God would not say this about us if it didn't also pertain to him that he also has looking and made sure that he had enough Mercy had enough Grace had enough love love had enough Holy Spirit to finish the building that he started amen he's he's not going to uh put us under a certain law without him himself also abiding under the same law so therefore he's going to make sure that he has enough to finish and I'm thankful for that because we're living in the finished time and that's what we have been putting been put here for for it isn't but you know in this time that we're living in it's not really he that starts it's that finishes uh and it isn't he who starts a house or starts a building or or starts something but it's it's it's in the finishing of it that the glory is there uh you know and the only winner of the race that we're in is the one who finishes it's not the one who just cross that that starts a race but doesn't cross the line he may have started out and ran just as fast or faster than anybody else that could run or or seemed like to have more endurance but along somewhere he I fell away and he didn't finish therefore he did not win amen we we're here to cross the finish line amen that we're here to cross the finish line so it's not just about beginning it's about finishing to win I I know we know we live in the time you know of of of a lot of participation trophies you know you you you participate in something they do this with a lot of the little kids if they participate they all get a trophy well we're not all going to get a trophy unless we finish the race amen and you know athletes they they they train and they train and they run they lift weights they they beat their bodies into subjection they get up when their body don't want to they eat right when they don't want to they they have goals and that goal is to win they're and all they do all of that to fight for a corruptible Crown they fight for a a corruptible clown Crown maybe it's a a a thing of gold weight around their neck or or something else whatever it is but it's very temporary but they do so much and they put so much in it to get this how much more should we put into this race when we're not fighting for a corruptible crowd or fighting for an Incorruptible crowd amen we're fighting for eternal life and and I believe that God's going to have somebody in this age is going to finish that's going to Across the line and I I'm not just speaking about going across the line by go by by death but he's going to have somebody that's going to finish the word spoken about a body change amen that's going to cross that line that finish line that that line that he has placed there in his word you know there was a man I can't pronounce his name but he was from Tanzania he was a marathon one Runner you probably heard about him but he he had been training his whole life to run this Marathon there in Tanzania and it was actually held there in Mexico City in the 1968 Olympics and and he gets up there and he starts running this uh this race and now where he had trained the climate wasn't the same and he began to cramp up and have some issues and and along the way he fell down and badly wounded himself and and dislocated his knee joint and his shoulder hit the pavement and just really injured and hurt but he just continued to run and you know what he would he would actually would finish the race and he would finish last among 57 others that had finished but there had been about 75 that had started and 57 that had finished but you know here he finished and and 3 hours and 25 minutes and 27 seconds almost exactly an hour and 5 minutes behind the winter but by the time he came to the Finish Line his knee was bag bag bandaged and he was bleeding and there was only a few people left there in the stadium the sun was setting and you know and a you know television crew had heard about him and they come out to to to see about this one Runner that was going to finish and he finally crossed the finish line and such a cheer came from a very small crowd and and then he was interviewed later and he was asked why he continued running he said my he said these words he said my country did not send me here 5,000 miles to start a race they sent me here 5,000 miles to finish the race amen I believe that we have not put in this been put in this last age this last moments these last marks of time Amen to be ones who quit to be ones who give up to be ones who turn around but we have been sent here not to start the race we have been sent here to finish the race amen Jesus showed us while he was here what it was like to be a finisher he he finished what he was sent to do he was a winner and if we have the spirit of him the same one that finished his race and he sent back his Spirit we will also have the same desires we will also have the same drive we will also have the same thing in our life that we are here to do what God has sent us here to do we are going to fulfill the word that is spoken of us us amen I I brother brother Andrew SP uh Glover actually sent me this quote because he knew I'd been along these lines he sent it to me a few moments ago he said brother BR said when the word has been spoken for this certain generation there's going to be somebody rise on the scene that'll fulfill the word that is spoken because God spoke it and Jesus met every qualification that the word said Vindicated as Messiah exactly there is also words spoken in the Bible for this last days and those words have to come to life amen so as Jesus said I have come to fulfill amen he would say it he would say my meat is to do the will of him that sent me in other words what gives me strength for what I'm doing is I am fulfilling what was spoken of me that's the reason I can endure what I'm enduring that's the reason I can go through what I'm going through that's the reason why I can stand the temptation in the 40 days that's the reason I can stand all the mocking and the and the laughing and the making fun and calling names cuz I'm not I'm not looking at all of that I'm looking at what the word spoke about me and I'm here to fulfill the word spoken about me the mockers they are fulfilling the word spoke of them the critics they are fing fulfilling the word spoke of them but we are here to fulfill the word spoke about the last Runners the finishers of the race amen Jesus said when he would be there at the cross and we know what he had to get to through the garden he said not my will but thy will be done amen when Jesus therefore received the vinegar he said it is finished he had finished what he was sent to do amen you know why because it was words that spoke of him to do and to go through all that he went through he could not have done what he done if there not have been word spoke about that we could not do what we do unless there were words spoken about this generation about this time and and this moment that's why you can go through tremendous pressures and tremendous trials and come on the other side and still be walking towards the finish line or running towards the Finish Line why because there's word spoken about you and that word must be fulfilled amen we know the world that we're living in I I want us I want you to Have Courage the world that you're living in is an overcome world all right Jesus said this he said these things have I spoken to you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world I have overcome the world that do mean to triumph over to have dominion over to completely overcome to finish amen he has overcome the world so if he has overcome the world all the things in the world are overcome amen if if he broke the back of Satan and Satan is nothing but a bluff then everything under Satan is nothing but a bluff amen he he has no power he has no Dominion he said he he he has won so you can also win that's Hallelujah you have the spirit of the of a winner on the inside of you not the spirit of a loser a spirit of a winner in this race of life it's not crossing the line first that determines your winner is making sure you cross the line is making sure sure you you know you're going to have hard times you're going to we're go we're going to go through difficulties even after being in the atmosphere of great meetings how how many's already went through trials and hardships and mind battles and things but you know we need to still yet make this determination I'm going to cross the finish line brother brand spoke about a boy that was by you know the swin bicycle was going to win that bicycle and there was a lot of other guys that was way more qualified than he was to win it they had done they could do things brother ER Baxter was telling him said he said I could go downtown and get my mother's groceries put them under my arms come down through the streets up around cars never touch my handlebars I could ride sit backwards on it ride just the same as I could ride forwards didn't make no difference to me neither neither neither nearly all of them were great Riders and they were sure they were going to win that swin bicycle but they had this one little fell didn't look like much he wasn't really a good Rider and they he ain't going to win he ain't got a chance but when they put them all on the track and started them out everyone fell off but this little boy he rode right out to the end got off and it received a new bicycle and all the other ones are like well tell me how you done that and boy he said boys I'm going to tell you where you made your mistake I thought it all out before I got on there he said he said you see you were all trying to keep on the keep the bicycle on the board cuz they took this about a one foot board and they had put it about 3ot in the air and they had to ride the plank you know and ride down through there and he said what your problem was you was looking around you looking at the how how far you had to fall or how close you was to the edge he said I didn't do that he said because that made all of you nervous you got the wiggling around you fell off and he said I've seen that's you made your mistake he said but I never look down there I look to the end yes sir and he said I look to the end and kept steady he said that's it watch to the end and keep steady keep steady keep moving on I you said I'd be discouraged tonight if I wasn't if it wasn't that I was watching to the end and I just keep steady because why I'm not looking at the failures around me I'm not looking at those that are falling off I'm not looking at the fall beside me I'm looking to Jesus the author and the finisher of my faith and just keep looking to the end that's where you're going to cross the line brother Rand said he went to a football stadium one time and was there to preach stepped to the door stopped at the door and I looked up said is sign hooked hung there said it's not the size of the dog and the fight it's the size of the fight and the dog boy that's the truth I've seen some big dogs be a bunch of big sissies but I've seen some little dogs but they they could they' try to take your your whole foot off you say well look at all the great churches against this and do they said I don't care what size they are it's the fight that's in the dog it counts it's the faith that's in the individual if you're a coward just go back to your cuddle hole don't get mad at me that's a direct quote if you're a coward just go back to your cuddle hole cuddle with your problems amen cuddle with what's what's wrong and cuddle with all that stuff if that's what you want if you're a coward go cuddle with it that's what he saiding oh got tight your complexes you've been cuddling with them go back to your cuddle ho but brother if you're a soldier stand up here the battle's on right and wrong is engaged let's fight let's fight he said like old Peter cardr went into a city one time and said Lord you brought me here to come have a Revival and he R into this old store room begin to clean it up and the big bully of the Town come in the pistol still hanging on his side he said where's that guy that's going to have that Revival I'm going to whoop him he said well I'm him he said come on down off that ladder I'm going to whoop you he said you you going to have that Revival you going to have to whoop me first he said well I guess I have to go down there and do that then he said that little old bitty fell Peter cart right he was washing the window and he took his jacket off and he pulled it off and he walked down to that big bully and he said bully said what you doing he said well I was just washing windows he said well we don't allow no revivals around here he said well the Lord told me to have one well that's one thing you have to understand I run this town around here he said well oh do you he said he put down his rag he said before you can have a Revival you got to whoop me first he said oh I do well I'll just do that next then and he just took off his coat walked down there reached up by the collar grabbed that dude and jumped on top of him I had a dude in there and he said I must fight if I must reain increase my courage Lord and He pounded the tar out of him I didn't add that in there he P he pounded the tar out of him he said you got enough old bully said yes he got up and shook his hand and the bully got saved that night in church he said you just take the word of God and cut your way through every doubt every frustration every worry whatever's in your way well I got to do that next he said well whatever's in your way just get the next job done amen take off your coat all right they talking about I couldn't keep my coat on very long I don't like a I can't stand preaching in a coat cuz I'm in a fight I ain't comfortable I like to be loose yeah come on somebody cuz that Old Devil he's a slew foot and he's trying every service to try to stop it or try to hinder it right well if you're next come on you be next amen it's time some of you grab the devil as hard as you could and start whooping him his heart as you can he said well I can't even see him grab the word of God and start punching him with the word and say Dev you're next which one's next which one's next I'm here to fight if I must ra and increase my courage Lord sir take off your coat and Barrel right into it just keep on going one objective quote I'm going to win amen I can't lose I'm going to win you know Paul would would would uh equate the race of life with the race he would watch there in Rome and different places and he'd write about them as we know in Philippians 3:12 he said not as though I had already obtained either already per perfect but I'll follow after that I may apprehend that for which also I'm apprehended of Christ Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but there's one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind you want to be a winner forget those things that are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize amen it's an eternal prize it's not a temporary prize listen now we're not fighting what we're fighting to go get us a gold medal put around our neck no we're fighting what we're fighting to get a new body Amen to go throughout eternity with our Lord and savior and our loved ones this is what we are training for this is what we're running for this is what we're fighting for on a Wednesday night 1 Corinthians 9:24 says know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain the one who's going to receive it the one who crosses the Finish Line every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things but they that do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight as I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bringing it into into subjection least by any means that I have preached to others and myself should be a Castaway amen second Timothy 4:6 for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all of them also that love his appearing so I I got to reading about people who run races and people who are winners you know the way to first become a winner is to lose the loser mentality for for Israel for years they what they deal with slave mentality that's right well I'm just for nobody's Lord and they actually use the people use their loser mentality as humility no it's loser mentality amen get rid of it well what is some okay I'm glad you asked what's some loser mentality I help you out there blame others when you fall refuse to change when you're presented with the evidence and the truth that you're wrong don't learn from your mistakes have a my way or the highway attitude choosing and I stand up for truth and righteousness I fail there's nothing I can do failure is the end of the road for a loser but not for a winner we just heard about it he got up and he kept going so I got to looking at winners and losers and the difference and the difference of their mentality it was a coach that actually wrote this to his team and he said a winner is always ready to tackle something new a loser is prone to believe it can't be done a winner makes mistakes and says I'm wrong a loser makes mistakes and says it wasn't my fault and blame someone else a winner is challenged by problems but goes through it a loser never wants to face it and always goes around it but never gets by it always circling around the same thing a winner realizes there's no time like the present to get the job done a loser is prone to procrastinate with hopes that things will be better tomorrow yeah I know it's we we'll get past this in a minute a winner thinks positive acts positive lives positive a loser usually has a negative attitude and a negative approach to everything a winner says let's find out a loser says nobody knows a winner makes commitments a loser makes imp empty promises so that right there that statement right there tell you God's a winner sir amen God's a winner a winner says I'm good but I'm not as good as I should be a loser says I'm not as bad as a lot of other people are amen a winner lose learns from those who are superior a loser tries to tear down those who are superior amen hallelujah you know I I I just seen something earlier I was sent it to brother Andrew we was talking and it was just a saying says be careful who you let on your ship said because if they can't be the captain many times they want to sing it and that's the truth you better make sure it's Jesus you're letting on your ship amen a winner says I'm good but I'm not as good as I should be a loser said I'm not as bad as a lot of other people amen a winner Works harder than a loser and has more time a loser is always too busy to do what's necessary I'm not preaching at nobody I'm preaching to winners and losers losers amen I hope the more winners than we got losers a winner says he's sorry by making up for it a loser says I'm sorry but does the same thing the next time a winner knows what to fight for and what to compromise on a loser compromises on what he shouldn't and fights for what isn't worth fighting about a winner listens a loser just wants his turn to talk a winner feels responsible for more than his job a loser says I only work here Bo a lot to learn from winners and losers a winner says there ought to be a better way to do it a loser said this is the way it's always been done a winner works hard to achieve his goals a loser just gets by a winner is always part of the answer a loser is always part of the problem a winner always has a plan a loser always has an excuse a winner says let let me do it a loser said that's not my job a winner says sees an answer to every problem a loser sees a problem for every answer a winner says it may be difficult but it's possible a loser says it may be possible but it's too difficult oh winners have dreams losers have schemes winners say I must do something losers say something must be done winners are part of a team losers are apart from the team did you hear that maybe I'll read that one again winners are part of the team losers are aart from the team winners see gain losers see pain winners see possibilities losers see problems winners believe in winwin losers believe in them to win and somebody for them to win somebody has to lose winners see potential Los users see the past now this one right here took me just a minute to get but boy when it got so wo winners are like a thermostat losers are like a thermometer that that thermostat over there what does it do it controls the atmosphere so if they set it at 72 you better it better stay at 72 or something's wrong with the machine behind it but that thing is set there to set an atmosphere a thermometer does what it goes up and down with the atmosphere amen so I believe the children of God ought to be thermostats amen we ought to set atmospheres and and the atmosphere is not to be set low it's to be set High into the heavenlies because that's where we're called to be amen seated together with Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so we don't come as a thermometer to church and we're up and down with with us no we're set in the atmosphere that's right I come here to praise God I come here to worship God I come here to give him glory I come to give him praise got nothing to do with anybody else winers say do unto others as you'd have them do unto you losers say do it to others before they do it to you win choose what they say losers say what they choose and speak you know we know words have power and you know our and brother brand would teach this over and over and Bible teaches it about our confession that we must confess that he is the high priest that can be touched that our confession must be a positive confession he would say your mental attitude toward the promises of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude so amen what is it it's producing an atmosphere change that you're not just sitting in your pity and sitting in the problems and sitting in all of this but you're getting up and you're setting the atmosphere I'm not going to be in a Pity atmosphere of pity I'm not going to be in an atmosphere of delusion I'm not going to be in an atmosphere of despondency I'm going to rise up above that so how do you do it you start speaking the word of God Amen and what does the word of God say in Philippians 4 I can do all things see first off you got to get the C out of your life I can't do this I can't be that that's the devil's language amen you can God's languages you can I can I will I do believe I can do all things John for says I am born of God and I have World overcoming Faith residing on the inside of me because it's the same Faith Jesus had and he overcame the world and he put the same spirit that was on the inside of his body inside of his bride and they can have that same Faith to rise up and overcome every devil in hell Colossians says I let the peace of God rule my heart and I refuse to worry about anything Proverbs 3 says TR TR I will trust in the Lord with all my heart and I will not lean into my own understanding Isaiah 54 says no weapon formed against me shall prosper every tongue formed against me shall be condemned Revelations 12:11 says I am an overcomer and I have overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony yes sir there he goes again your confession the word of your testimony Psalms 46 says God is my refuge and strength he is my well proven help in the time of trouble Romans 8 says no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us first John 4 says greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world Amen because he has overcame the world you know the prophet of God in the Bible Elijah went to visit a king who was surrounded by enemy and he was going to give him a way of Escape so he says what do you got there you got a bow got an arrow he said why don't you why don't you take that arrow and shoot it shot it through the window he said now go get it and I I just play him out what is this all about why I got to walk I shouldn't have shot it so stinking far he walking to go get that arrow and he comes back and he says now right here I want you to strike the ground and him and his loser mentality he's three times and the prophet was Roth he said what what if you would have just now you struck the ground three times you'll have three victories but if you you should have struck it till the syrians were all annihilated that's right amen that's the way we must not come to the house of God we cannot come with that same loser mentality we have been given an arrow of Deliverance Hallelujah he's been shot from the bow amen and we have been given it's in our hands and you might be surrounded tonight but don't just H haphazardly strike the ground and well it's Wednesday night I don't feel like it I've been through a lot that's all I got God no there's syrians around us there's Devils that's trying to destroy us there's spirits that are trying to come into our homes amen

bystander and he he's sitting off there somewhere no he just saying hey strike the ground yeah strike that promise if you'll just strike it I'll move on the scene if you'll just hit it I'll come

get us a little F Psych ol ology and maybe get to an organization somewhere maybe just you know brother Tim it's Wednesday night are you kidding me why'd you come if you got that attitude and I'm not saying anybody does but I'm just saying if you do have that attitude why you come but I hope you come with an attitude is I need something from God and I've heard in his word if I grab that arrow and I'll strike it at that heart of that enemy God will move on my behalf he'll show me like he did Abraham he's Jehovah Gyra he'll show me he's Jehovah rapi he'll show me he's more than enough not just enough he's more than [Applause] enough he said the church tonight is still striking short the church is struck short of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the is struck short of deliverance from sin it's struck oh I just join a church brother when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it takes that old temper out of you it puts a dress on you makes you act like a lady make you quit you smoking dry drinking lying stealing everything brother when you get to baptism of the Holy Spirit it separates you it delivers you from the things of the world it makes you love God it makes you go to church it makes you worship Him it makes you tell your neighbor about it it makes you live above sin Hallelujah but the modern Church is short well we got a church we got a good teacher we got theology that's about as much as you know about anything every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line God sent the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he put it in the hands of the Church of the Living God it's the arrow of God's Deliverance it'll deliver you from sickness it'll deliver you from sin it'll deliver you from worry it'll deliver you from depression I know it to be so it'll deliver you from trouble it'll deliver from worldness but you strike short he said not that first bunch of Jews they didn't strike short no they Struck it for everything God had for them they had all kinds of signs well I'm not looking for a sign you're striking short signs and wonders follow them that believe amen man you know we got people well we ain't after sign oh I understand we're not after sign but sign should be with you if you believe and what do you believe in the word of God well the word of God if it's the word of God it's the Living Word of God with the Living God behind it with Living Word living signs living wonders Miracles healings deliverances power of the Holy Ghost yes sir they had all kinds of signs wonders Miracles divers gifts of the Holy Ghost everything they had it but we are striking short the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the last days has come to the Gentiles how me is a gentile in the Western Country and God shot the arrow of Deliverance to us and have just about Struck it long enough to make oursel well I'm assembly well I belong to the Church of God glory to God hallelujah well I'm a message believer bring it to our language well I'm a Thunders I'm a this I'm a that that's about all we got he said brother there not an organization that God said strike with it isn't a theology he said strike with he's given to each individual the strike to strike against the powers of the devil for sickness sin filthiness backsliding fussing oh my Wilderness but we strike short we go over to a church we join it we think it's all right that's not all right brother don't strike short of nothing that God has for you the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever strike that don't be afraid God said so I'm the Lord that Health thee strike that amen God said so it's the arrow of Deliverance and it's been brought into the Church of the Living God tonight tonight it has been brought into the Church of the Living God we can talk about a historical God but what's the matter tonight the church has been taught is some historical thing but and not put down the present day but what good is the god of Elijah if he's not the God today what good is the god of Moses and the one that delivered the Hebrew children and close the mouth of lions if he can't still do that today but I'm here to say he can yes sir and he will and I believe he's the same yesterday what good does it do to talk about a God who used to heal cancer who even a few years ago healed cancer if he don't still do it today but I'm here to tell you he can he will and I believe it with all my heart and I'll keep striking and striking and striking until that Devil's annihilated cuz there's a bride with a arrow God's deliver she going to keep striking every Cancer until one day cancer is no more she going to keep striking depression until one day depression is no more she going to keep striking sugar diabetes and every kind of the devil and disease until it's no [Applause] more cuz she's a winner we learn from others mistakes we saw where that King fell off we're not a loser therefore we're not going to fall off where he fell off not a winner now we going to get the bicycle okay we're going to get the new body how many people are getting so close to that end on that plank you said I'm sure some of them boys wrote it almost got almost they could almost feel it oh I can't wait to get my hands on that bicycle this a so wonderful this message we got this is so great what's that though that fault there well that don't I don't know how to answer that question and they get all tied up in the questions the bloop Theo but there's somebody just riding along may not be the fastest may not be the best Rider may not can ride with no hands on the hand of bars may not can turn around backwards and sit on it and ride it like he was riding it frontwards but D look looking at all that it ain't about who's the trickiest it's about who finishes it's about who goes and gets it come on we can talk about a body change but there got to be somebody that crosses the line it's in the word and that word is going to rise up talk about a god of yesterday is like standing in front of a painted fire oh boy this feels so good oh this is so great I ask you sister Felicia CU she's one of the coldest natured people I ever met don't mean she's cold just mean she's cold nature she got a warm personality when she comes over the house you go to her house it's hot just is what it is if she comes to your house and it ain't hot she wants a blanket maybe two or the fire turned on one what it would do sister felici I brought you my iPad or or whatever and turned on a picture of a fire just had all the looks of a fire you know today they can imitate it really good don't let look at me like I'm stupid they do on YouTube just go look it up they can have P pretty music and crackling of fire but go put your hands up to it and see what it feels like cold as the glasses coming through you're not going to get a bit of warm from it ain't going to help you can stand there and act like it's a fire all you want to right but you're going to freeze to death amen and this is what we're seeing is going on people are freezing to death why cuz they're by a painted fire they can talk about a God who yesterday would do things and yesterday he used to do this and yesterday and yesterday but they won't bring him present tense which puts the fire back on the altar again and it's Illuminating fire and it's a fire that's got some heat to it and let me tell you if you touch it you're going to have a sensation you're going to have something that's going to happen listen he he said he's the Holy Ghost and Fire well go try to touch a natural fire and tell me if you don't have some kind of sensation if you don't you're a dead man but if you got any ounce of life on the inside of you oh glory to God any laugh just a little bit on the inside of you you can be acting like you're dead you can be looking like you're dead but if you're really not dead somebody take you to the fire and let you touch it something going to happen there going to be a scream there going to be a shout there going to be a sensation tears running whatever it is something's going to happen we don't have a historical God we have the one that's the same yesterday today and forever and he ain't dependent on some denomination he's dependent upon his word well how can I join this church brother Timothy by being born again it ain't coming up here shaking our hands or filling out a new paper no we ain't got none of that it's being born to the that's the only way you can be part of the family be born of the family but he said the the arrow of Deliverance is filled with Mercy tonight given to you what what we ought to do is pick it up and Strike It For the Glory of God every divine blessing that God promises Yours by faith if you'll receive it do you believe it I believe it's the light of God's word and God promised here he would do a certain thing and he does it every time he's taken at his word it's the light of God this word is a light you cannot put out the light I tell you I was really amazed we got to go up into Arkansas and see the eclipse few minutes that it took place there it was quite a quite a thing to witness but you had these special glasses cuz you you know you can't look at the sun you look at the sun your eyeballs are going to get put out but you put these special glasses on and you can look up at the Sun and you can see it you see it's burning you see the flares coming off of it and all of a sudden we started seeing the shadow move across it and you know it got down to just a little bitty sliver I'm talking about I thought oh man I can see that I can look now about put my eyes out just a little as small as sliver I mean just barely he peeking out around there and it's still you couldn't look at it and then the moon moved over in totality for the three minutes or whatever and it but it still didn't put out the light the light was still shining the light was still moving yes it was darker where we were sitting but there was still light it was completely blocked off but there was still light boy I couldn't help but think about our God who we have been given special anointing to be able to look into his presence and not be blinded by but we can see him in his glory see him in his power see him in his resurrection amen it doesn't take but just a little bit hallelujah amen in this service tonight it doesn't take but just a little bit of his glory to drop in and all worries will fade away all stress will move away and you won't want to leave his presence and the devil can block it out completely if he wants to but I'm here to put him on notice as that sun was still shining and it was completely blocked out you couldn't see any any physical part of it amen but you can see a little flare here or there but oh still light beaming all around that's right Hallelujah devil you can't put out this light you can try to block it you can try to cover it up you you can try to do whatever you want to but it's still going to shine it's still going to go forth cuz it's a winter ain't enough Devils to put it out 1 John 5 and verse4 says for whatsoever is born of the god overcometh the world I means born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God faith is the victory it is the victory to win it is Faith to win faith is the power to overcome any circumstance it is the power to overcome any sickness it is the power to come overcome any sin faith is a victory over death faith is the victory over sin faith is the victory over sickness faith is the victory over worry faith is the victory over frustrations faith is the victory over the world Amen what is it faith is Faith is the Conqueror faith is an overcomer it isn't a peacemaker right it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is Faith what it is to conquer conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prison come on somebody I believe there's enough faith in this building right now that'll arrest cancer and throw it back into prison I believe there's enough faith in this building that overcome every sickness overcome every sinck overcome every doubt overcome every worry overcome every frustration are you tired of striking yet come on we're going to overcome these things we're going to rise above these things it's not going to overcome us no we are going to overcome it sister Genie that cancer is not going to overcome you you are going to overcome it Hallelujah we are going to rise above it young people that depression is not going to overcome you you are going to win over it that's right cuz we are winners we are going to override what happens when you override it goes over the boundary set in the beginning so if if you have something there I was used this before but I was in brother dereck's shop one day and his bag sealer went out and it was we he was well guess I'm about to get another one well I got to looking at it sister Ruth was there we got to digging into it I had happen to have a vote meter and I got to look into this you know what had happened the emergency stop Button had went out as emergency stop button that if things get out of control you know he hit it and it shuts the machine off I said said do you need this emergency stop button he said no I said well we're going to override it I clipped the wires on it bypassed it machine started working again just perfectly why cuz I went past the boundaries it had set and see the devil wants to put boundaries upon your life he loves to have an emergency stop button in your life to where he can push it and you can only go so far you can only do so much if you get out of hand you know remember when you used to do this all right remember who you used to be but if you'll get the Holy Ghost you know what'll happen he'll go in there and he'll clip those wires and he'll wire them up correctly and they'll flow the power will flow correctly and it'll bypass his buttons it'll bypass what he can do I'm looking at a people that the devil has been bypassed in their life has been overrode some of you said you was going to be nothing but druggies and drunkers and out of the street prostitutes whatever he said you wasn't going to be nothing but a low down lousy sinner but the Holy Ghost came in the room and it changed the wiring and it went past what he had and his plans he thought he had a stop button on sister lant's life and he's going to push it and ended all but the Holy Spirit came in the room and he bypassed what he had done and he took it back back to what it should be come on somebody I'm talking about a people that has Faith to win Faith to overcome Faith to override the devil wants to come in services like these maybe not tonight but like these and sit down on them well I don't really care if you come to church just don't get nothing yeah just don't recognize him when he comes and he's sitting on you but there's a people that can look at that and say devil you don't have no right over my life your button is broke yes sir your button is broke you have no button to push on my life it has done been done away with therefore I can throw up my hands and praise you again and again oh well what are
