[1:02:33] into the word of the Lord
[1:02:36] I would just like to read a scripture
[1:02:38] tonight from Isaiah chapter 10. and

[1:02:44] and verse 27.
[1:02:49] we thank the Lord for his word tonight
[1:02:51] and
[1:02:53] we thank God that he's preserved
[1:02:55] a Bible that we could read from

[1:03:01] and verse 27 and it shall come to pass
[1:03:03] in that day
[1:03:05] that his burden should be taken away
[1:03:07] from off thy shoulder and his yoke from
[1:03:11] off thy neck
[1:03:12] and the Yoke shall be destroyed
[1:03:15] because of the anointing
[1:03:19] because of the anointing may God bless
[1:03:23] his words you can be seated tonight I
[1:03:25] want to speak to you just shortly
[1:03:27] tonight on a a text here from this
[1:03:30] scripture but I want to title this the
[1:03:33] anointed bride body of Jesus Christ
[1:03:37] the anointed bride body of Jesus Christ
[1:03:41] the prophet says in Christ The Mystery
[1:03:43] of God revealed he said there would come
[1:03:45] a time forth he would Express himself in
[1:03:47] the fullness of his godhead deity
[1:03:48] through his church he would have
[1:03:51] preeminence in his church oh my the
[1:03:54] anointed man now the anointed people
[1:03:58] to bring back the anointed bride and
[1:04:01] bridegroom anointed by why accepting
[1:04:05] what Eve turned down and Adam but coming
[1:04:08] back with the anointing of the word
[1:04:10] because he said my word is spirit see he
[1:04:14] Anointed with the word what Eve turned
[1:04:17] down he comes back and we accept he
[1:04:21] comes back and we accept the anointed
[1:04:23] man now the anointed people to bring
[1:04:26] back the anointed bride and bridegroom
[1:04:29] to bring back the anointed bridegroom
[1:04:32] and I take my text from there tonight
[1:04:34] the anointed bright body of Jesus Christ
[1:04:37] you know I believe tonight that the
[1:04:39] anointing matters
[1:04:41] I believe that the anointing matters the
[1:04:43] anointing changes things you know I
[1:04:45] realize that there is a lot of people in
[1:04:47] the world that don't believe the
[1:04:49] anointing does matter they don't respect
[1:04:51] the anointing it matters not to them but
[1:04:54] I believe to any Bible reader they know
[1:04:56] that the anointing is of most important
[1:04:59] to the Church of the Living God it is a
[1:05:02] great difference in your life or whether
[1:05:04] that life is an anointed life or it's
[1:05:06] just a carnal life amen and God shows us
[1:05:09] in the scripture of how much the
[1:05:11] anointing matters now in the Old
[1:05:13] Testament the scripture that I read to
[1:05:15] you is a scripture from the book of
[1:05:16] Isaiah and it's actually dealing with a
[1:05:19] time that when uh when God showcases
[1:05:22] what what difference the anointing makes
[1:05:24] uh when that when when when the enemy
[1:05:27] attacks the anointed of God now the
[1:05:30] scripture that I'm reading here has to
[1:05:32] do with a time that when the Assyrians
[1:05:34] were great it's just before Babylon this
[1:05:36] is when the Assyrian army is is grew up
[1:05:39] in great power and they're controlling
[1:05:40] the world
[1:05:41] and they're actually attacking Israel
[1:05:44] now what has happened in previous
[1:05:45] scripture here is that Israel has been
[1:05:48] attacked and overtaken by Assyria now
[1:05:51] when we say Israel you must realize that
[1:05:53] that is actually a time after Solomon
[1:05:56] when Israel has been divided into two
[1:06:00] different kingdoms now we're going to be
[1:06:02] dealing with the Israel as a kingdom and
[1:06:04] Judah as a kingdom there's ten tribes in
[1:06:06] Israel and there's two tribes in Judah
[1:06:09] and they have separate Kings and many
[1:06:10] times you'll hear them talk about the
[1:06:12] king of Judah or the king of Israel
[1:06:14] they're talking about Kings of two
[1:06:16] different kingdoms they're all the
[1:06:18] children of Abraham but they've been
[1:06:20] divided after the rule of Solomon the
[1:06:22] next Kings they begin to divide and so
[1:06:25] the scripture tells us of course that
[1:06:26] God raised up the Assyrians and he did
[1:06:29] it because that there had come great uh
[1:06:31] there had come great uh idolatry in
[1:06:34] Israel and God always allowed uh Israel
[1:06:38] to be punished whenever it moved into
[1:06:40] idolatry and it moved away from the
[1:06:44] Living God but now the thing that that
[1:06:46] the world or that the that the rest of
[1:06:49] the world didn't know is that Israel was
[1:06:51] God's chosen people so if God allowed
[1:06:54] something to happen to them it was only
[1:06:56] because God allowed it to happen and God
[1:06:59] would allow like he did with the
[1:07:00] Assyrian army he allowed them to go in
[1:07:02] they overtook Israel and they literally
[1:07:05] carried them away now you've heard of
[1:07:07] the Lost ten tribes of Israel and many
[1:07:09] people say well they lost 10 tribes now
[1:07:11] what that's talking about is it's
[1:07:13] talking about the ten tribes that were
[1:07:15] living in Israel they never had a
[1:07:18] returned home in their Homeland like it
[1:07:21] was in the days later when Jerusalem was
[1:07:23] carried away into Babylon and they were
[1:07:25] only there for 70 years and then they
[1:07:27] returned back to Babylon so they
[1:07:28] returned back so those two tribes never
[1:07:31] were lost but the other ten tribes were
[1:07:33] lost and Scattered into the world that's
[1:07:34] what is going on now those tribes have
[1:07:37] been gathered up and sent back into
[1:07:38] Israel but what we find out is is that
[1:07:41] whenever the these ten tribes are
[1:07:43] destroyed under the Assyrian army that
[1:07:45] it makes this a Syrian King it makes him
[1:07:47] uh boastful it makes him prideful you
[1:07:50] know it's kind of much like
[1:07:51] Nebuchadnezzar because that he had a
[1:07:53] victory he decided that he was greater
[1:07:56] than the god of Israel because he
[1:07:58] whipped Israel he thought surely I'm
[1:08:00] greater than the god of Israel but he
[1:08:02] didn't recognize that the only Power he
[1:08:05] had over Israel is that God gave him
[1:08:07] that power or he never would have been
[1:08:09] able to do that so what happens is he
[1:08:12] got boastful in his mind and then began
[1:08:14] to say well I'm going to go down there
[1:08:16] and do to Jerusalem and to Judah what
[1:08:18] I've done to Israel and when when he
[1:08:20] begins to do this Jerusalem begins to
[1:08:22] get worried the king of Judah begins to
[1:08:24] to struggle and and the next thing you
[1:08:26] know then he goes to the prophet and he
[1:08:28] begins to say to him well we're going to
[1:08:30] be destroyed just like them others are
[1:08:31] going to be destroyed amen but that's
[1:08:34] when the scripture is written when the
[1:08:36] prophecy of Isaiah comes back to him and
[1:08:39] he says see but the burden off of thee
[1:08:41] shall be broken and the scripture said
[1:08:43] the Yoke shall be destroyed because of
[1:08:46] the anointing now look what he's saying
[1:08:48] to them because of the anointing that is
[1:08:51] upon Jerusalem amen things will not be
[1:08:54] the same here as what they were in
[1:08:57] Israel now see the devil a lot of times
[1:08:59] he he attacks people he attacks all
[1:09:01] kinds of people he does all kinds of
[1:09:03] things but just because he can do it in
[1:09:05] one place doesn't mean he can do it in
[1:09:08] the other I I think sometimes we ought
[1:09:10] to remind the devil that he is a limited
[1:09:13] devil
[1:09:14] hey man I don't care the devil likes to
[1:09:16] run around like he can do anything he
[1:09:18] wants anytime he wants any way he wants
[1:09:20] but let me assure you tonight the devil
[1:09:22] is limited and the Bible actually is
[1:09:25] full of places where God put a limit on
[1:09:27] the devil and allowed him to do certain
[1:09:30] things but wouldn't mind to do other
[1:09:31] things to let you and I know amen that
[1:09:34] no matter what the devil thinks amen
[1:09:37] God's still is in control at all times
[1:09:40] of our lives and everything that happens
[1:09:42] to us I mean job's a great example isn't
[1:09:45] he amen but God told that devil he can
[1:09:48] do whatever he wants but then he draw
[1:09:50] the line to show you can only go so far
[1:09:53] come on y'all know it's all in the
[1:09:55] prophecy in the Book of Genesis when the
[1:09:57] Bible said let the woman seed shall
[1:09:59] Bruce the head of the serpent and he
[1:10:00] said what did he say he said but the
[1:10:02] head of the serpent shall bruise the
[1:10:04] heel of the woman's seed and watch amen
[1:10:07] it means it's only limited to the heel
[1:10:10] so the devil is limited of what he can
[1:10:13] do in the Church of the Living God God I
[1:10:15] don't think there's probably a greater
[1:10:16] example of that and sitting right behind
[1:10:18] us tonight whether Ron Spencer sitting
[1:10:21] here amen I don't know now we're working
[1:10:23] on three years amen and just a few years
[1:10:25] ago they were telling brother Ron amen
[1:10:28] get your preparations you'll only be
[1:10:29] here a few days amen this cancer is
[1:10:32] going to take you you're not going to I
[1:10:34] think four months is what they were
[1:10:35] giving him amen but here we are three
[1:10:38] years later and he's still with us now
[1:10:40] you said preacher amen there's still
[1:10:42] cancer there's still sickness I'll tell
[1:10:45] you Ron Spencer's sick but sickness is
[1:10:48] not in dominion over at Ron Spencer's
[1:10:50] life
[1:10:51] hey man I'll tell you this and I want
[1:10:53] that devil to know that you can make
[1:10:55] these bodies sick but you cannot control
[1:10:57] our lives and you have no dominion over
[1:11:01] the Church of the Living God
[1:11:03] I want the devil to know I know he's a
[1:11:06] limited demon I know he's a fallen angel
[1:11:08] and he has limits and he cannot do what
[1:11:11] he wants where he wants High wants there
[1:11:13] is a God who looks over the children of
[1:11:16] Israel there's a God that moves upon the
[1:11:19] heart of the children of Israel
[1:11:21] I believe it tonight I believe that God
[1:11:23] Amen allows things in our lives but God
[1:11:27] knows exactly so can I say this very
[1:11:29] clearly Cancer Cannot kill a Believer
[1:11:32] amen nothing can take a Believer amen
[1:11:36] the only reason a man leaves this Earth
[1:11:38] is when God is finished with that man
[1:11:41] and until that time the devil can throw
[1:11:44] everything he wants but it will do no
[1:11:47] good
[1:11:48] he said that's pretty bold that's the
[1:11:50] word of God
[1:11:53] that's the word of God so amen the
[1:11:56] prophet is telling these these the king
[1:11:58] of Judah listen I know it looks bad I
[1:12:00] know Israel looks like but just because
[1:12:02] that's happening to Israel doesn't mean
[1:12:04] it's going to happen here I hope you're
[1:12:07] hearing me because that Devil's raging
[1:12:09] against our young people he's raging
[1:12:11] against it all over the world but just
[1:12:13] because he's destroying all the youth in
[1:12:15] this world doesn't mean he can put his
[1:12:17] hands upon the Church of the Living God
[1:12:19] listen to me young people you are not
[1:12:22] just another young people you are not
[1:12:24] another just another group of people you
[1:12:27] are the anointed of almighty God God has
[1:12:30] poured his anointing upon the Church of
[1:12:32] the Living God and with give us some of
[1:12:35] the greatest young people in the world
[1:12:37] sets in the message of the hour not
[1:12:40] because you're members of evening lives
[1:12:41] not because you're members of true words
[1:12:43] Tabernacle not because you're a member
[1:12:46] ever has a new life Outreach but because
[1:12:48] God chose you before the foundation of
[1:12:51] the wearer and is Anointed you to say in
[1:12:54] and the most wicked of all ages but our
[1:12:56] God has confidence and what he did will
[1:12:59] stand in the midst of all this trouble
[1:13:03] now Isaiah wanted this man to know him
[1:13:05] he Isaiah is a Bible preacher I love how
[1:13:08] Isaiah does things because he don't just
[1:13:10] say something Isaiah goes ahead and
[1:13:12] makes a point scripturally with him if
[1:13:14] you look at the 26th verse of the same
[1:13:16] chapter of Isaiah in the 10th chapter 26
[1:13:19] verse look what he said he said the Lord
[1:13:21] of hosts shall stir up a Scourge for him
[1:13:24] according to the slaughter of the median
[1:13:26] at the rock of orb as he was at the rod
[1:13:29] see so shall he lift up after the man of
[1:13:31] Egypt now look what he's saying to him
[1:13:34] Isaiah says to the king of Judah look
[1:13:36] this devil that's approaching you I'm
[1:13:39] going to make it like it was in the days
[1:13:42] of Gideon at the rock of Orem
[1:13:45] now I know y'all study your Bibles but
[1:13:47] that rock of orbs a pretty good study
[1:13:49] now what it's about is that when Gideon
[1:13:51] took 300 men and whipped 135 000.
[1:13:57] isn't that beautiful he took 300 million
[1:13:59] and whipped 135
[1:14:02] 000 because the anointing was upon his
[1:14:05] life the anointing matters when you go
[1:14:08] to war the anointing matters when you're
[1:14:10] looking for deliverance the anointing
[1:14:12] matters because the anointing can bring
[1:14:15] you a Deliverance in the midst of an
[1:14:17] unequal odds and and look what happens
[1:14:19] 135 000. now here's here's the story
[1:14:22] though because there was a bunch of the
[1:14:24] of the children of Israel I think it was
[1:14:26] actually ephraimax who was actually a
[1:14:28] part of the original men that come out
[1:14:31] to go to war with Gideon and God turned
[1:14:33] them away and sent them home but there
[1:14:35] was a group of the original ones that
[1:14:37] come out that wasn't able to go fight
[1:14:38] they didn't go home
[1:14:41] they went and waited to see maybe they
[1:14:43] could get a chance in battle so they
[1:14:46] didn't go all the way back home they
[1:14:47] didn't they didn't just say hey we ain't
[1:14:49] on the front charge and we're just gonna
[1:14:51] go home forget about this amen but they
[1:14:53] went somewhere and waited and just so
[1:14:55] happens maybe we can get in this battle
[1:14:57] and the scripture records that whenever
[1:14:59] they begin to root the enemy that the
[1:15:02] enemy begin to run and the leaders of
[1:15:04] the midianites took out in a certain
[1:15:06] direction and Gideon called for the
[1:15:09] backups to enter into the into the the
[1:15:12] battle and they chase down the leaders
[1:15:14] of those medianites and they found them
[1:15:16] hiding in the rocks of orb now they call
[1:15:19] it the rock of orb now it wasn't the
[1:15:21] rock of or being it was just big rock
[1:15:23] out there in the middle of the place but
[1:15:24] this is where one of the leaders of the
[1:15:26] of obedience hid behind that rock now I
[1:15:29] tell you it's a pretty powerful thing to
[1:15:31] know this because what the moral of the
[1:15:33] story is that you can't hide from God
[1:15:36] when God becomes your enemy
[1:15:40] when God takes up the battle
[1:15:43] that that leader of the million I start
[1:15:46] I'll cause all this trouble and I run
[1:15:48] off and I'll hide a rock somewhere but
[1:15:52] listen there is no rock that can hide a
[1:15:54] man there is no rock that can hide a
[1:15:56] devil amen if God would take up a battle
[1:15:59] there is no devil can hide from the God
[1:16:02] of Justice and Grace this is somebody
[1:16:04] said well amen I serve a God of Peace
[1:16:06] I'll tell you why he is a God of Peace
[1:16:08] but he's also a God of War
[1:16:11] and when our God begins to fight for you
[1:16:14] I tell you what it is he'll dig up those
[1:16:16] enemies and Destroy them everyone you
[1:16:18] know what he'll do he'll cause them to
[1:16:21] name places after the defeat of the
[1:16:23] devil
[1:16:24] hundreds of years later Isaiah is
[1:16:27] literally telling the king of Judah I'm
[1:16:29] gonna make these Assyrians like the rock
[1:16:32] of orb in other words amen if you're
[1:16:34] wondering go out there and look at those
[1:16:36] rocks and they're a testimony to the god
[1:16:39] that saves by 300 and destroys 135 000
[1:16:44] because of the anointing if you don't
[1:16:46] trust the anointing the rock of Orab is
[1:16:49] there to testify that when a man trusts
[1:16:52] the anointing of God that the god of
[1:16:54] Abraham can change the situations of his
[1:16:57] life let me say something to you then I
[1:16:59] I trust the anointing of God I trust the
[1:17:03] power of the Holy Ghost to change things
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:09] yeah he said well brother Wayne what do
[1:17:11] you saying the scripture says that he
[1:17:13] would make him like the slaughter of the
[1:17:14] medianites and they would also make it
[1:17:16] like the rod upon the sea
[1:17:19] can you imagine the the children of
[1:17:22] Israel all knew the story of how God
[1:17:24] swallowed an entire Army in a sea it
[1:17:27] only happened one time in Scripture
[1:17:30] and it was one of the great stories in
[1:17:32] the history of their of their
[1:17:34] forefathers so he said these these these
[1:17:36] Assyrians are going to be like those
[1:17:38] Egyptians
[1:17:39] yeah
[1:17:41] they're going to swim with too much lead
[1:17:49] now in Second Kings it tells the same
[1:17:51] story
[1:17:53] because what happens is that Judah is is
[1:17:56] worried about it and the Bible said in
[1:17:59] the 19th Chapter 32nd verse Second Kings
[1:18:01] it said therefore thus saith the Lord
[1:18:04] concerning the king of Assyria
[1:18:08] I like this
[1:18:09] thus saith the Lord thank you concerning
[1:18:13] the king of Assyria he shall not come
[1:18:15] into the city
[1:18:18] nor shoot an arrow there
[1:18:21] nor come before it with a shield nor
[1:18:24] cast a bank against it by the way that
[1:18:26] he came
[1:18:28] it's the same way he's going to return
[1:18:32] and shall not come into this city saith
[1:18:34] the Lord I will defend the city to save
[1:18:37] it for my own sake for my servant David
[1:18:42] said oh my goodness it's been hundreds
[1:18:44] of years since God had sent anoint David
[1:18:48] it's been a long time ago people thought
[1:18:51] well that that don't matter that that
[1:18:52] old man poured that oil over that man's
[1:18:54] head that has nothing to do with nothing
[1:18:56] it's just an old man in a house pouring
[1:18:59] some oil and saying some words over some
[1:19:01] runny little kid but all these years
[1:19:03] later
[1:19:05] a serious trying to attack but the words
[1:19:09] of a prophet spoke over a child of God
[1:19:12] still had anointing and I'll tell you
[1:19:15] something tonight because of the
[1:19:17] anointing upon David as Syria could not
[1:19:20] take Jerusalem
[1:19:23] that might not mean a lot to people what
[1:19:25] this William Branham has said over this
[1:19:27] Church of the Living God Amen but it
[1:19:29] matters to God it might not matter what
[1:19:32] was said in some little room when the
[1:19:34] spirit of God was poured over to you and
[1:19:36] some words were spoke over your life it
[1:19:38] might not mean anything to the to the
[1:19:41] church world what William Branham said
[1:19:43] concerning a bride but when it comes to
[1:19:46] God
[1:19:47] I want you to know because of the
[1:19:49] anointing because of what was spoken
[1:19:52] over your life there's no devil can
[1:19:55] defeat you there's no power that can
[1:19:57] hold you let me say this the devil
[1:20:00] cannot come now this city and the same
[1:20:03] way he came he will return
[1:20:07] he said preacher you you're off a boat I
[1:20:10] know the anointing of God Is Spoken over
[1:20:12] this generation and there is a group of
[1:20:15] Believers that have put under the
[1:20:17] anointing of a prophet of God and when
[1:20:19] those words were spoken over them
[1:20:21] they're not just little words
[1:20:24] they're effective words the powerful
[1:20:26] words listen if you don't think they
[1:20:28] ain't powerful that was the mystery of
[1:20:31] why David could whip Goliath amen with
[1:20:34] only a slingshot
[1:20:36] mystery of why David was not scared of
[1:20:39] Goliath because he was already anointed
[1:20:43] your life can say what he wanted to I'll
[1:20:46] destroy you I'll tear you down amen but
[1:20:48] David was already anointed so he wasn't
[1:20:51] scared of that battle he wasn't worried
[1:20:53] what was going to happen because the
[1:20:55] anointing was already setting upon him
[1:20:57] and listen tonight you know how to fear
[1:21:00] that devil you don't have to fear what
[1:21:02] he said he's going to do with your life
[1:21:04] and how he's going to destroy because
[1:21:06] he's a liar to begin with and there's an
[1:21:09] anointing of God upon the Church of the
[1:21:12] Living God that anointing says we will
[1:21:15] not die but we shall live and we will
[1:21:18] live in power and we'll live in
[1:21:20] authority
[1:21:25] said brother Wayne what's the mystery
[1:21:26] I'll tell you the mystery is the
[1:21:28] anointing
[1:21:30] what's the difference in these churches
[1:21:32] it's the anointing
[1:21:35] the anointing is the difference
[1:21:38] you say preacher the anointing don't
[1:21:39] matter oh but for David's sake for the
[1:21:42] anointing's sake
[1:21:43] for the anointing sake because I
[1:21:46] anointed David they will not take this
[1:21:48] city that's pretty powerful he said
[1:21:51] preacher did God back it up God back to
[1:21:53] them the Bible says in the 35th verse it
[1:21:55] came to pass that night the angel of the
[1:21:57] Lord went out
[1:21:58] and smote in the camp of Assyria a
[1:22:01] hundred four score and five thousand a
[1:22:03] hundred and eighty five thousand
[1:22:06] Assyrians died that night because of the
[1:22:09] anointing
[1:22:11] the king of Judah never touched the head
[1:22:13] of one of them Assyrian soldiers but the
[1:22:16] anointing went out
[1:22:18] and the anointing destroyed the enemy
[1:22:21] that was gonna hold I say tonight amen
[1:22:24] that what we really need is to get the
[1:22:26] anointing of God in the church and to
[1:22:28] turn it loose and let it kill every
[1:22:30] devil and to kill every problem let it
[1:22:33] kill every situation let the anointing
[1:22:36] loose in the Church of the Living God
[1:22:40] come on you got problems we can't fix
[1:22:42] you got situations we cannot counsel you
[1:22:45] through but there's a God who can come
[1:22:48] down in the building tonight and change
[1:22:50] every situation
[1:22:57] so behind this stuff I'll tell you what
[1:22:59] these these these things are coming
[1:23:00] they're built up to destroy us all these
[1:23:03] things are being built up and and I see
[1:23:05] the enemy Rising them this I see the
[1:23:07] enemy Rising here I sing that calm
[1:23:10] yourself
[1:23:12] worry not let the fear pass from you
[1:23:15] because of the anointing
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:19] so preacher what are you saying I'm
[1:23:21] saying in Isaiah 54 the same Prophet
[1:23:23] said no weapon that is formed against
[1:23:26] thee shall prosper and every tongue that
[1:23:29] rise against thee in the Judgment thou
[1:23:31] shall condemn this is the heritage of
[1:23:34] the Servants of the Lord and the
[1:23:35] righteousness is of me saith the Lord
[1:23:37] does it matter he said A thousand shall
[1:23:40] fall at thy side and ten thousand out
[1:23:43] thy right hand but it shall not come
[1:23:46] neither
[1:23:49] brother the anointing matters
[1:23:53] the anointing matters when God hath
[1:23:56] anointed
[1:23:57] Amen in the Book of Luke the fourth
[1:24:00] chapter
[1:24:00] the scripture tells us a story that even
[1:24:03] the son of God
[1:24:05] had become anointed
[1:24:07] isn't that something the Son of God
[1:24:10] became anointed Luke chapter 4 and verse
[1:24:12] 17 the Bible said and never delivered
[1:24:14] unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah
[1:24:16] which had opened the book and he found
[1:24:18] the place where it was written and I
[1:24:20] have a time to preach there but I'll say
[1:24:21] this the book of Isaiah 66 books
[1:24:24] 66 chapters
[1:24:26] it's the only book Jesus could take and
[1:24:30] have the whole Bible
[1:24:32] so he opened the book
[1:24:35] and found the place
[1:24:38] I love it he found the place that was
[1:24:41] written of him he identified with the
[1:24:44] anointing that was upon him and what it
[1:24:46] was going to do he knew exactly what
[1:24:48] that anointing was for because that the
[1:24:51] prophet had spoke over his life listen I
[1:24:54] know there's a bunch of Pentecostals out
[1:24:55] here and they're shouting and screaming
[1:24:57] over the anointing amen but if there's
[1:24:59] no word over their life what's the
[1:25:01] anointing for
[1:25:02] they pour an awning out pour anointing
[1:25:04] out shouting scream and hollering amen
[1:25:06] that's all good but what for
[1:25:08] but they must be a word and that word is
[1:25:11] spoken over the church and under the
[1:25:14] United word then the bright body knows
[1:25:17] how to manifest the word of the age of
[1:25:19] living in
[1:25:22] the spirit of the Lord is upon me he
[1:25:23] knew why it was on him
[1:25:25] and he knew what it was
[1:25:27] isn't that beautiful he knew why and
[1:25:30] what
[1:25:31] a lot of people probably thought of all
[1:25:33] kinds of things but he knew he said he
[1:25:35] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:25:37] poor to heal the brokenhearted preached
[1:25:40] Deliverance to the captions of course
[1:25:41] this is Isaiah 61 he's reading to preach
[1:25:43] the acceptable ear of the Lord and he
[1:25:46] closed the book and gave it again to the
[1:25:48] minister set down all the eyes of them
[1:25:50] were fasted and the Son of God upon him
[1:25:52] and he began to say unto them this day
[1:25:55] is this scripture
[1:25:57] fulfilled in your ears
[1:26:00] this day is this scripture fulfilled in
[1:26:03] your ears the anointing is here to
[1:26:07] Manifest this portion of the word of God
[1:26:09] he was identifying the anointing was
[1:26:13] upon him for the purpose of identifying
[1:26:16] that portion of scripture for the season
[1:26:19] they were living in that anointing amen
[1:26:22] that anointing of course that anointing
[1:26:25] is the great Pillar of Fire
[1:26:28] now I've got to skip ahead and Skip back
[1:26:31] here to get to these points but you bear
[1:26:34] with me just a moment but the anointing
[1:26:36] is the pillar of fire how many knows
[1:26:39] that
[1:26:40] can we uh can we remember here not too
[1:26:43] long from where we're setting amen the
[1:26:46] anointing of God Came Upon William
[1:26:49] Branham it was just there over in Texas
[1:26:52] when the Lord had a great picture made
[1:26:54] with him now in the pillar of fire in
[1:26:57] 1953
[1:26:59] the Bible the prophet of God says it
[1:27:01] like this he said he led Israel he said
[1:27:04] I want you to read some scripture
[1:27:05] closely now God commissioned Moses to
[1:27:07] send him he said over in Exodus the 23rd
[1:27:10] chapter of the 21st listen closely now
[1:27:12] I'll send my angel before thee to keep
[1:27:15] me in the way and to bring thee and to
[1:27:17] the place which I have prepared
[1:27:20] to bring thee into the place that I have
[1:27:22] prepared I will send my angel before
[1:27:25] thee now the prophet of God says this he
[1:27:28] says now watch this my angel shall go
[1:27:31] before thee he said now let's see what
[1:27:34] the angel looked like
[1:27:36] in the 13th chapter of Exodus he said we
[1:27:39] read it in verses 21 and 22 for the Lord
[1:27:42] went before them by day and a pillar of
[1:27:44] cloud to lead them and By Night by the
[1:27:47] pillar of fire to give them light can we
[1:27:49] have that picture
[1:27:51] right here in in a Coliseum in Houston
[1:27:54] amen we found that the critics were
[1:27:57] trying to disprove William branham's
[1:27:59] Ministry and that God was a Healer and
[1:28:01] that God was a savior and they
[1:28:03] challenged they challenged these things
[1:28:04] and they brought a photographer along to
[1:28:07] take pictures of how they were going to
[1:28:09] overrun these men of God and make fools
[1:28:11] of them well I'll tell you what after
[1:28:14] taking all them pictures they only had
[1:28:16] one picture to turn out
[1:28:18] they only have one pitcher to turn out
[1:28:20] and it's that picture right there
[1:28:23] now some people say well brother Wayne
[1:28:24] Amen what's that picture about well
[1:28:27] first of all let me say it's an
[1:28:28] authentic picture
[1:28:30] and it's been verified scientifically to
[1:28:32] be the only
[1:28:34] Supernatural photograph ever taken
[1:28:38] the phenomena amen of the picture that
[1:28:41] is there is not the man William ran him
[1:28:44] the phenomena is what's above his head
[1:28:48] it's exactly what we're reading in
[1:28:51] scripture here that he was the same
[1:28:53] angel that led the children of Israel
[1:28:56] which was the pillar of fire the angel
[1:28:59] of the Lord or the angel of the Covenant
[1:29:02] now that Pillar of Fire that you're
[1:29:04] looking at right there that picture was
[1:29:07] not taken by your friends
[1:29:09] that picture was not taken by our
[1:29:11] ministry team that picture was not taken
[1:29:14] by Perry green that picture was not
[1:29:16] taken by Oral Roberts that was not
[1:29:19] brother branham's campaign took it that
[1:29:21] was your critics that took that picture
[1:29:25] that was your critics that took that
[1:29:27] picture and God has made your critics
[1:29:30] testify
[1:29:32] not the same angel that led the children
[1:29:36] of Israel
[1:29:37] his come back to anoint the Bride of
[1:29:41] Jesus Christ and I salute the return of
[1:29:45] the pillar of Fire in My Generation I
[1:29:48] say we ought to welcome him in the
[1:29:50] Church of the Living God
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:56] you say brother Wayne the same one the
[1:29:59] same very one you have a picture of him
[1:30:02] now listen when Paul was preaching he
[1:30:05] didn't have that picture when Peter was
[1:30:06] preaching he didn't have that picture
[1:30:08] when Martin Luther was preaching he
[1:30:10] didn't have that picture and they turned
[1:30:12] the world upside down and here we have
[1:30:15] physical evidence of the awareness of
[1:30:18] the purifier among the church we ought
[1:30:21] to turn this world upside down with the
[1:30:24] anointing of God and has come in this
[1:30:26] generation we ought to tell every critic
[1:30:28] we ought to tell every unbeliever
[1:30:34] foreign
[1:30:39] amen there's a lot of reproach there's a
[1:30:41] lot of reproach with this well in the
[1:30:43] Bible in Hebrews 11 and 26 it said that
[1:30:46] Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ
[1:30:48] greater than the riches of Israel he
[1:30:51] would rather have the reproach of the
[1:30:54] pillar of fire is all the riches of
[1:30:57] Egypt I'll tell you what God would make
[1:30:59] a man like that you say Christ the
[1:31:02] reproach of Christ Jesus wasn't alive in
[1:31:04] Moses's day
[1:31:08] come on the physical body wasn't born to
[1:31:10] the middle of the Bible and Moses was
[1:31:12] prophesying of his coming Moses said was
[1:31:15] speaking here Paul was speaking of
[1:31:17] Christ being the anointing or being the
[1:31:20] pillar of Fire
[1:31:23] now that was what John bore record of at
[1:31:27] the Jordan River when that great Pillar
[1:31:30] of Fire hovered and came down and dwelt
[1:31:33] in the body of Jesus Christ that's why
[1:31:36] he was born Jesus and called the Christ
[1:31:39] he was the anointed Son of God he's not
[1:31:43] just the Son of God he's the anointed
[1:31:45] Son of God he's not just the word he's
[1:31:47] the anointed word he's not just a letter
[1:31:50] he's the Dynamics of the letter he's not
[1:31:53] just the word he's the word and the
[1:31:55] flesh together
[1:31:59] my God it's not dead he's still alive
[1:32:02] he's not there in a tomb in Jerusalem
[1:32:06] he's here tonight in authority and power
[1:32:09] and I feel the vibration of the power of
[1:32:12] God
[1:32:15] that pillar fire is the anointing it's
[1:32:19] the logos
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:23] it's the logos in the beginning what's
[1:32:27] the logos
[1:32:28] in the beginning was the low gospel and
[1:32:31] the logos was with God and the lows us
[1:32:32] was God isn't that something in the
[1:32:35] beginning was the law do you know what
[1:32:37] the prophet tells us he tells us the
[1:32:39] first thing ever coming to Creation was
[1:32:41] that light
[1:32:42] the first thing that ever happened God
[1:32:45] said let there be light
[1:32:47] hey and that great visible image of the
[1:32:50] invisible God become worldly out there
[1:32:53] is the great logos of the anointing and
[1:32:56] out of that come ever created Power and
[1:32:59] out of that come every creative
[1:33:00] anointing listen no wonder no wonder
[1:33:03] when God come back into this generation
[1:33:06] and a prophet stood there and created
[1:33:08] squirrels no wonder he could do it the
[1:33:11] same one that created the first squirrel
[1:33:14] was the same one creating squirrels
[1:33:17] today the same God Amen that would cause
[1:33:21] a resurrection in that day
[1:33:26] it's the same God that was in this day
[1:33:30] Christ was the anointing the logos that
[1:33:33] went out of God
[1:33:35] Jesus Christ the same 1964. now any
[1:33:38] Bible any Bible reading neither knows
[1:33:40] the angel was Christ
[1:33:42] and he comes today in the form the same
[1:33:45] Christ
[1:33:46] manifesting himself
[1:33:48] look at this he led them by Pillar of
[1:33:51] Fire that was the anointing
[1:33:53] the Holy Spirit
[1:33:55] Christ
[1:33:57] powerful brother Brown says to the
[1:33:59] pillar fire the angel if Jesus is the
[1:34:01] same Angel the same Angel of the
[1:34:03] Covenant was Jesus Christ for the Bible
[1:34:05] said Moses esteemed the Christ The
[1:34:07] Riches of Christ greater Christ is the
[1:34:10] logos of course the one that went out of
[1:34:12] God in the beginning
[1:34:16] the first thing that ever appeared in
[1:34:18] the heavens has appeared in our
[1:34:21] generation
[1:34:23] the first visible image that God ever
[1:34:26] took has come to our generation to tell
[1:34:30] you I am still calling
[1:34:33] in the face of laodicea in the face of
[1:34:36] every system in the face of every
[1:34:38] tradition I am still God I want you to
[1:34:41] know he's not just God above us he's not
[1:34:44] just God with us he has come to be God
[1:34:47] in us
[1:34:50] the same yesterday today and forever if
[1:34:52] he ever was God he still is God he said
[1:34:55] preacher how did he get in how did he
[1:34:57] get in this I'll tell you what a prophet
[1:34:58] said he said read the book of Acts the
[1:35:00] second chapter when the Bible said they
[1:35:02] were all gathered in one Accord 120 of
[1:35:04] them were gathered in the upper room and
[1:35:07] I'm righty Russian Wind come in the room
[1:35:10] and there were cloven tongues of Fire
[1:35:13] Cove and tongues of fire he said
[1:35:16] preacher once that's about clove and
[1:35:17] tongues of fire the prophet of God said
[1:35:19] God the great Lucas divided himself and
[1:35:23] got into the bodies of those believers
[1:35:29] now you can call the Holy Ghost a motion
[1:35:31] if you want to you can call the Holy
[1:35:34] Ghost some little some little something
[1:35:35] you can take or leave if you want to but
[1:35:38] in the book of Acts the Holy Ghost was
[1:35:41] the physical presence of the pillar of
[1:35:43] fire divided and brought into the Church
[1:35:46] of the Living God God is in his church
[1:35:48] today in the power of the pillar of fire
[1:35:51] to bring an anointing upon this Vibe and
[1:35:55] let me tell you it makes a difference a
[1:35:57] Holy Ghost Field Christian next to a
[1:35:59] denominational Christian makes a
[1:36:01] difference
[1:36:03] all right
[1:36:05] it makes a difference it's a pillar of
[1:36:06] fire it is broke up set upon each of
[1:36:09] them clothing tongues of Fire
[1:36:11] I love this one brother Brown says see
[1:36:13] we are not a divided people we've got to
[1:36:16] be in unity because we're each one
[1:36:17] holding a part of God we must come
[1:36:19] together then the pillar of fire is
[1:36:21] manifested in its wholeness in his
[1:36:22] fullness when his church sets together
[1:36:24] in Heavenly places then the fullness of
[1:36:27] the power of God is in his church each
[1:36:29] one holding spiritual gifts and
[1:36:31] spiritual offices coming together that
[1:36:34] brings the pillar of fire back again
[1:36:39] foreign
[1:36:41] s the pillar of fire back again he
[1:36:45] separated himself Be not Afraid 61
[1:36:47] divided himself amongst the people
[1:36:49] cloven tongues of fire set upon each one
[1:36:51] of them God separated himself to his
[1:36:53] church no wonder he spoke where two or
[1:36:56] three are gathered in my name I will be
[1:36:58] in the midst of them
[1:37:00] if you have to agree on one thing ask it
[1:37:03] and I'll give to what is it when the
[1:37:05] little fire here and the little fire
[1:37:07] there each part of you are a part of God
[1:37:10] when it comes together it's the body of
[1:37:14] Christ United
[1:37:17] brother no wonder the devil hates
[1:37:19] meetings like this no wonder the devil
[1:37:21] hates when they come from Europe and
[1:37:23] they come from Ohio and they come from
[1:37:25] Arkansas and they come from Texas and
[1:37:27] they come from Louisiana no wonder he
[1:37:29] hates it because even the devil can see
[1:37:31] and in this dark dark world when the
[1:37:34] light of the pillar of fire is moving in
[1:37:36] a heart
[1:37:39] can you imagine the devil watching the
[1:37:41] little Elixir fire driving down to
[1:37:43] Minden Louisiana and I'm throwing
[1:37:45] everything they can you know I'm telling
[1:37:47] you the truth that devil done everything
[1:37:49] he could do to stop you from gathering
[1:37:51] with the other licks of fire in the
[1:37:53] house of God I think brother Ron throwed
[1:37:55] up five or six times before we left the
[1:37:57] house that Devil's saying I don't want
[1:37:59] that liquor fire down there but listen
[1:38:01] God has put us together to unless the
[1:38:04] anointing of these men of God gather
[1:38:06] together
[1:38:07] to give that devil a weapon in the house
[1:38:11] of God bring the anointing
[1:38:19] the anointing that is here with me now
[1:38:21] is the Angel of the Lord it is the
[1:38:24] pillar of Fire
[1:38:26] I'm quoting a prophet here now he said
[1:38:28] preacher what are you saying you know
[1:38:30] that was a that's a huge thing going on
[1:38:32] in the in the energy world right now
[1:38:34] Empire world there's a huge thing in
[1:38:36] laser beams
[1:38:38] it's a pretty powerful study if you want
[1:38:40] to go study it it's amazing because
[1:38:42] everybody's trying to figure out how to
[1:38:44] get energy outside of coal and natural
[1:38:46] resources so the the cheapest the
[1:38:49] cheapest way they can go is if they
[1:38:51] could get the sun on the Earth
[1:38:54] because the sun produces more energy in
[1:38:57] a minute than we can use in a hundred
[1:38:58] years you know I don't know what the
[1:38:59] figures are but it's it's huge because
[1:39:02] the sun uses it uses Fusion
[1:39:05] to power itself and it is an unlimited
[1:39:09] source of power
[1:39:11] now I want you to think about this
[1:39:13] because scientists back in the 70s
[1:39:16] decided that we need to get the sun on
[1:39:19] the Earth
[1:39:20] now they said how can we do this that
[1:39:23] was nothing they had that had enough
[1:39:25] individual power to reproduce a fusion
[1:39:28] through through uh light beams but now
[1:39:32] now if you study lasers lasers are
[1:39:34] powerful they use them in Warheads and
[1:39:35] everything else now if the lasers have
[1:39:37] become very powerful but there was a
[1:39:39] fellow who designed a product they that
[1:39:42] he could take I think it was 192 193
[1:39:45] laser beans and he could take those
[1:39:48] laser beams any of them are powerful by
[1:39:49] themselves but he decided and got his
[1:39:52] figures that if I could get 192 of them
[1:39:55] focused on a point
[1:39:57] that is as small as the Eraser on a
[1:40:00] pencil that I could reproduce the same
[1:40:03] energy on the earth that is found in the
[1:40:06] Sun
[1:40:07] not one of them could do it by
[1:40:09] themselves but if we could get a 192
[1:40:13] agreeing on one point it would generate
[1:40:17] the same power that was in the heaven
[1:40:20] would come on the Earth
[1:40:22] well I'll tell you what they started in
[1:40:24] the 1970s they actually built a very a
[1:40:27] very powerful system and they built a
[1:40:29] great big complex they call it the
[1:40:31] ignition facility
[1:40:33] and they want to get together to ignite
[1:40:36] they want to have this ignition of these
[1:40:38] lasers now they had to design them I was
[1:40:40] preaching about this at home the other
[1:40:41] day and one of our brothers there he
[1:40:43] said I don't know how many phds he's got
[1:40:45] a couple of them and I was talking about
[1:40:47] it and after the service he come and
[1:40:49] said well actually he was he's in 3D
[1:40:51] printing he said actually we hired the
[1:40:53] engineer the engineered that project he
[1:40:56] said I know him personally
[1:40:57] he said they engineered that he said so
[1:41:00] as they had to build a huge a huge place
[1:41:02] and they had to bring it in a certain
[1:41:04] condition and they had to get everything
[1:41:07] in a certain spot before they could fire
[1:41:09] and have ignition now they started that
[1:41:12] in the 1970s do you all realize they
[1:41:15] have just now fired that thing back
[1:41:17] about a year ago they finally got a
[1:41:19] successful ignition which means they
[1:41:23] made fusion into fission right here on
[1:41:25] the Earth
[1:41:26] vision and diffusion in other words I I
[1:41:29] don't get deep into it but I will say
[1:41:30] this to you y'all y'all know if I get
[1:41:33] them right Fusion is the thing that
[1:41:36] causes the division no opposite Fusion
[1:41:39] is the thing that brings them together
[1:41:41] because I remember this point in physics
[1:41:45] when it fizzes it breaks it apart
[1:41:48] so it's a it's a fission bomb it's it's
[1:41:50] a it's a bit of a fears you know it Fizz
[1:41:52] is our physics so but but it breaks down
[1:41:55] to to y'all what that actually means is
[1:41:57] it means the nucleus of the atom breaks
[1:42:00] apart creates an energy
[1:42:02] which is exactly what they used when
[1:42:05] they blew up Hiroshima
[1:42:07] but now today the the nuclear bombs
[1:42:10] we're using
[1:42:11] are actually Fusion bombs
[1:42:14] where they're not dividing atoms they're
[1:42:17] putting atoms together
[1:42:19] but to put two atoms together you had to
[1:42:22] have an explosion that is powerful
[1:42:24] enough to jam them together it's like
[1:42:26] you take two magnets that have opposite
[1:42:28] and they want to repel it takes a lot of
[1:42:30] power to put them together and and you
[1:42:32] see that those those nucleuses of the
[1:42:34] atoms are positive charge they don't
[1:42:36] want to go together but they have found
[1:42:38] a way to be able to reproduce a an
[1:42:42] actual
[1:42:43] sunlight Fusion on the Earth by putting
[1:42:47] all of them beings together he said
[1:42:49] preacher what point are you making I'll
[1:42:50] tell you this they can take 192 man-made
[1:42:54] light beams and get enough Unity out of
[1:42:57] him through scientific research to put
[1:42:59] them on the same point and release an
[1:43:02] ignition that'll bring a powerful as
[1:43:05] nuclear upon the Earth he said preacher
[1:43:07] what are you saying I'm saying this is
[1:43:09] the season that God has released a
[1:43:12] headship over the Church of the Living
[1:43:14] God that can take members of this bride
[1:43:17] from around the world and put them on
[1:43:21] the same point at the same time and
[1:43:24] focus them by the power of God listen if
[1:43:26] the man can do it with 192 brother what
[1:43:29] was it that day on the day of Pentecost
[1:43:31] when 120 of them gathered in the upper
[1:43:34] room and they was in one mind and one
[1:43:36] Accord
[1:43:37] and what happened on the day of
[1:43:40] Pentecost we are still talking about
[1:43:42] today
[1:43:45] I believe if we could get 120 in this
[1:43:48] room
[1:43:49] and we'd get them together on the same
[1:43:51] principle and the same point that
[1:43:53] there's an anointing that would release
[1:43:55] in this building that it'd be greater
[1:43:58] than anything you've ever saw in your
[1:44:00] life
[1:44:03] he said Lil Wayne it can get greater
[1:44:04] it'll get greater and it'll get greater
[1:44:07] and it'll get greater this pride is not
[1:44:09] going backwards brother she's going
[1:44:11] upwards she's increasing in anointing
[1:44:13] she's increasing in power the seed has
[1:44:16] come out of the shop and we are
[1:44:19] manifesting the word and the age we're
[1:44:21] living in
[1:44:24] foreign
[1:44:26] that fission bomb it's not half as
[1:44:30] powerful as the as the new Fusion it's a
[1:44:32] lot more powerful amen now this is I
[1:44:35] don't want y'all to throw me out for
[1:44:36] this but y'all y'all forgive me but I
[1:44:38] read it right in the message brother
[1:44:39] random said when he told Hattie Wright
[1:44:41] about creating them squirrels he said
[1:44:44] when she said Amen to that he said it
[1:44:47] released a super anointing in the room
[1:44:50] that was greater
[1:44:53] then when I created this world
[1:44:56] when the bride amends this message
[1:45:03] I believe but the message being preached
[1:45:06] today will generate a greater anointing
[1:45:09] and it did not in the days when brother
[1:45:11] Brandon broke these messages open
[1:45:13] because now there are believers who have
[1:45:17] opened up their soul and said God pour
[1:45:19] the anointing here and allow the power
[1:45:22] of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:26] I believe it's generated and anointing
[1:45:28] in the Church of a living God that
[1:45:30] brings strength and power and anointing
[1:45:33] upon Him 120 gathered I believe it's in
[1:45:36] the unity of the spirit of God it's the
[1:45:38] pillar of fire now what's he doing here
[1:45:41] he's leading the church he's leading
[1:45:43] them to promises
[1:45:45] he's leading them into anointing
[1:45:49] now I know people people they come into
[1:45:51] meetings that we preaching and they say
[1:45:54] well my other gets awful emotional and
[1:45:56] there gets off will y'all excuse me
[1:45:59] and y'all y'all forgive me I'm sorry
[1:46:02] this message has power
[1:46:05] but if you won't water this down and
[1:46:07] you'll take the gloves off and preach
[1:46:09] what the prophet said they will generate
[1:46:12] a power that'll change our Market bodies
[1:46:16] there's an anointing in this message
[1:46:18] we're gonna have to borrow the
[1:46:21] Pentecostals anointing we don't have to
[1:46:23] borrow the madness's anointing the
[1:46:25] anointing on this pride is the same
[1:46:28] Jesus Christ
[1:46:32] hello I know what I'm saying and then
[1:46:34] they say well you got them young people
[1:46:36] hollering and shouting and dancing well
[1:46:39] let me ask you something is there an age
[1:46:41] limit on this anointing
[1:46:44] who put the age limit on it who said
[1:46:47] only all people can get under the
[1:46:49] anointing of God but I believe we ought
[1:46:51] to release the anointing I believe we
[1:46:53] ought to let it go I believe it ought to
[1:46:55] get in our young people and fill them
[1:47:00] well
[1:47:02] some guy running around here the other
[1:47:04] day saying well they're preaching too
[1:47:05] deep for the young people they're too
[1:47:07] deep for the young people their TV I
[1:47:09] think well have mercy what young people
[1:47:10] are you talking about man
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:13] the young people I'm talking to could
[1:47:15] stir the head of a theologian
[1:47:17] [Applause]
[1:47:19] young people aren't preaching to a Bible
[1:47:21] taught message Fair Holy Ghost Field
[1:47:24] children of God come on they do more
[1:47:26] than play football on the weekend they
[1:47:28] do more they come to the house of God
[1:47:30] and have meetings and enjoy them
[1:47:33] so preacher what are you saying I'm
[1:47:35] saying this I'm saying young people
[1:47:37] today understand the depths of
[1:47:39] pornography they understand the depths
[1:47:41] of Internet they understand the debts of
[1:47:43] society how much greater can the child
[1:47:46] of God understand the depth of God and
[1:47:49] allow the power of God to come in the
[1:47:52] church
[1:47:54] I say we ought to take the limits off
[1:47:56] we're going to take the bonds off we
[1:47:58] ought to release Jesus in his own church
[1:48:03] so by the way we might lose control well
[1:48:05] praise be to God
[1:48:07] I pray we lose control long enough
[1:48:09] somebody can get saved
[1:48:15] well I think you're out of order with
[1:48:17] that the prophet of God said you are to
[1:48:18] worship God do you forget who you are
[1:48:20] when's the last time you did it you are
[1:48:22] to get so drunk in the spirit of God
[1:48:25] that they would say to you are these all
[1:48:28] drunk and somebody would have to say no
[1:48:30] sir these are full of the Holy Ghost and
[1:48:33] the power of God
[1:48:37] I believe we ought to release it I
[1:48:39] believe we ought to come on church amen
[1:48:42] we are promised an anointing in this age
[1:48:44] my Bible says in the Book of Joel then I
[1:48:46] will pour out my spirit saying for the
[1:48:48] Lord and in the same season I will pour
[1:48:51] out more former and lateral raise
[1:48:53] [Applause]
[1:48:55] oh then there's the problem in it's the
[1:48:58] rain
[1:49:01] that's the problem because everybody
[1:49:02] says well brother Wayne don't you know
[1:49:04] people can shout and dance and still be
[1:49:06] lost
[1:49:07] and I I I don't want to be arrogant but
[1:49:10] once in a while I want to go duh
[1:49:14] do you don't think that I ain't read
[1:49:16] them for 132 quotes where the Prophet
[1:49:18] preaches on false anointed ones you
[1:49:20] don't think that I hate red every time
[1:49:22] brother Branham said you can shout and
[1:49:24] dance and have an experience and not be
[1:49:25] saved you don't think I don't read that
[1:49:27] I could care less amen what everybody
[1:49:30] else is doing or not doing I know God
[1:49:32] promised rain in this generation
[1:49:35] so what are we going to do God don't
[1:49:38] send the rain there's Hypocrites in the
[1:49:40] church
[1:49:41] God don't send the rain some people
[1:49:44] don't live right in the church don't you
[1:49:46] dare send no rain in the church as
[1:49:49] somebody that ain't saved might get a
[1:49:51] blessing we'll let them get a blessing
[1:49:53] it might be the only thing they ever get
[1:49:56] why would you refuse them a blessing
[1:49:58] from God
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:02] you said preacher what are you talking
[1:50:03] about I tell you this I believe the rain
[1:50:06] is here for a purpose
[1:50:08] I believe the rain is the anointing that
[1:50:11] God sends upon the church from the last
[1:50:12] day let me make my case here there are
[1:50:15] people sitting in this room that you are
[1:50:17] a seed of God from the foundation of the
[1:50:19] world
[1:50:20] I've got a prophet here saying that when
[1:50:23] you come into this life that was a seed
[1:50:25] down on the inside of you
[1:50:28] it didn't get put here when you come to
[1:50:29] the altar it didn't get here when you
[1:50:31] raised your hand it didn't get healed
[1:50:33] when you said I believe the message but
[1:50:35] you were put here in this Earth with a
[1:50:37] seed on the inside of you that was a
[1:50:40] part of the Eternal God from the
[1:50:42] foundation of the world because eternal
[1:50:44] life doesn't have a beginning and it
[1:50:46] doesn't have an end
[1:50:48] Eternal means Eternal that means you
[1:50:50] wasn't a son on any day you didn't start
[1:50:53] being a son yesterday the week before or
[1:50:55] 30 years ago if you ever are a son you
[1:50:59] always work
[1:51:03] you always were a son
[1:51:08] and down in your soul was a
[1:51:10] predestinated scene amen there's only
[1:51:12] one thing that will get through that
[1:51:14] seed it's the word that produces the
[1:51:16] Holy Ghost
[1:51:18] say preacher what are you saying I'm
[1:51:20] saying there's people sitting in here
[1:51:21] amen that was a seed to begin with and
[1:51:24] you're here by the foreknowledge of God
[1:51:26] there was a young man sitting in our
[1:51:28] meeting the other day at home he was
[1:51:30] sitting there next to his dad and just
[1:51:31] out of the blue I called his name I said
[1:51:33] are you his seed he said yeah I said are
[1:51:36] you sure he said yeah I said are you
[1:51:38] double sure he said yeah I'm sure I said
[1:51:40] you're sure you was hissy before you
[1:51:42] were born he said absolutely I said well
[1:51:44] don't you know that if God can show you
[1:51:46] that in the natural he can show you that
[1:51:48] in the spiritual
[1:51:50] well I didn't know this but two weeks
[1:51:52] later standing in a line at lunch he
[1:51:55] said brother Wayne the other day when
[1:51:56] you called my name and said those things
[1:51:58] I said yeah he said do you know I talked
[1:52:00] to my wife on Saturday night and I said
[1:52:02] honey since I've been 12 years old I've
[1:52:05] wondered if I was really a seed of God
[1:52:06] it's the message really for me and he
[1:52:09] said brother he said only me and my wife
[1:52:12] knew about that conversation he said and
[1:52:14] I told her I said if God would just beat
[1:52:17] me over the head I would know it's true
[1:52:19] and brother the next morning the first
[1:52:21] time he's ever been in our church that
[1:52:23] I've ever called his name ever and I
[1:52:25] called his name you said preacher what
[1:52:28] is that the word is still a discerner of
[1:52:32] the thought and the attention of the
[1:52:33] heart
[1:52:34] the anointing makes a difference
[1:52:40] say preacher why you say that I say that
[1:52:42] because I say this amen I'm sorry that
[1:52:45] this message produces anointing I'm
[1:52:47] sorry that it produces uncomfortable
[1:52:49] position for formal devils and
[1:52:51] traditional ideas but this message was
[1:52:54] sent to be arraigned upon the sin of the
[1:52:58] Living God I cannot help there is weed
[1:53:01] in the field
[1:53:03] I cannot help those Hypocrites in the
[1:53:06] church but I say their seed here also
[1:53:10] so let it rain
[1:53:12] let it rain let the Holy Ghost reign in
[1:53:16] the church with power and with anointing
[1:53:23] I feel like another I say Let It Rain I
[1:53:27] see the Holy Ghost reign of God are the
[1:53:30] Reign to never see this broke open until
[1:53:32] the power of God drops into the church
[1:53:38] but we don't believe in blessing our
[1:53:41] church
[1:53:41] [Applause]
[1:53:43] you know what you know I just have to be
[1:53:45] honest with you right here do you know
[1:53:47] people say to me all the time how can
[1:53:48] you say they were before they were well
[1:53:50] brother random made it simple for a
[1:53:52] hillbilly now somebody else might need
[1:53:55] it theologically this hillbilly
[1:53:57] understood a prophet good he said one
[1:53:59] day there was a duck he said who was
[1:54:01] born down in a chicken pen
[1:54:05] I know you know about the eagle but
[1:54:06] that's pretty good he's setting it up
[1:54:08] was born down in the chicken pen I
[1:54:11] thought that was pretty good because you
[1:54:12] know what some people wonder amen I was
[1:54:15] mixed up in this and I was mixed up in
[1:54:16] that by the way could I really ever get
[1:54:19] a birth did I ever come to life was
[1:54:21] there any quickening power you know what
[1:54:23] a prophet said he said it's the
[1:54:25] atmosphere that hatches there
[1:54:28] come on Church the atmosphere Hatches
[1:54:32] the Egg
[1:54:33] and that little fellow was stuck in a
[1:54:37] chicken pen being a duck you know the
[1:54:39] problem with chicken pins they're dry
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:43] you know what he was born for water
[1:54:47] he was not born for dry places he was
[1:54:50] born for water and let me tell you what
[1:54:52] a prophet said he said when that little
[1:54:54] fella walked around the barn one day and
[1:54:56] he saw a pond for the first time
[1:54:58] he said there was something happened to
[1:55:01] him and he got a smell of water and he
[1:55:03] runs straight for the pond nobody had to
[1:55:06] teach him nobody had to train him there
[1:55:08] was something in him that needed that
[1:55:10] one
[1:55:11] and let me tell you this if you're going
[1:55:13] to keep people trapped in the chicken
[1:55:15] yard you better keep them away from the
[1:55:18] water because the first time they ever
[1:55:20] smelled the water something on the
[1:55:22] inside begins to wake up and something
[1:55:25] makes them ready to run
[1:55:29] brother when that little duck begins to
[1:55:31] awaken listen it wasn't he wasn't by
[1:55:33] himself he was a duck to begin with his
[1:55:36] Queen daddy was a duck his great
[1:55:37] granddaddy was a duck he was a duck from
[1:55:40] long years ago all he needed was a
[1:55:43] little water he knew how to swim
[1:55:47] I say pour out the water and the Holy
[1:55:50] Ghost and let the church Slim
[1:55:57] no way I don't know how it is whether
[1:55:59] Ram said he were a pair of overhauls
[1:56:01] he said he had a he said he had a nail
[1:56:03] for a button he said we had a water hole
[1:56:06] down there we'd take off a running he
[1:56:08] said the first guy in would tell him how
[1:56:10] the water was
[1:56:12] he said I'd take off running I beat them
[1:56:14] all he said he said all I had to do was
[1:56:16] pull one nail and shake a little
[1:56:19] and he pulled at me on shake a little he
[1:56:21] said he'd jump off in that water and he
[1:56:23] said he'd turn around and wave the
[1:56:24] water's good come on in boys
[1:56:27] let me tell you the prophet was the
[1:56:30] first one in this water
[1:56:32] don't tell me I don't have a right in
[1:56:34] this Pond the prophet got in first and
[1:56:37] then turned around and said come on boys
[1:56:39] the water's good it'll wake you up it'll
[1:56:43] give you what you need to see
[1:56:48] hey I was a duck to begin with don't
[1:56:52] blame me for swimming I got
[1:56:56] it's in my DNA and so are you a child of
[1:57:00] God to begin with it was in your DNA
[1:57:02] that's why you enjoy the meeting with
[1:57:05] the anointing comes because you come
[1:57:07] from God you can go back to God
[1:57:13] come from that power
[1:57:17] no wonder when that fire begins to move
[1:57:18] something on the inside of you wakes up
[1:57:21] he said brother Wayne what are you
[1:57:23] saying I'm saying Jesus said in John 14
[1:57:26] he said he said it very clearly he said
[1:57:28] because I live
[1:57:30] ye live also
[1:57:31] [Applause]
[1:57:33] because I live you live what does that
[1:57:35] mean what a resurrection that was what a
[1:57:39] resurrection this is he lived now you
[1:57:41] live
[1:57:42] you live to manifest every word that was
[1:57:45] spoken of this generation
[1:57:47] what's going on here tonight Elohim is
[1:57:50] materializing himself
[1:57:52] [Applause]
[1:57:54] this is the whole plan of God he will
[1:57:56] speak a word anoint a word and manifest
[1:57:58] a word now you have a part in that word
[1:58:01] your part of the word is to manifest
[1:58:03] what was spoken in this generation and
[1:58:06] if there's a seed for the bride in this
[1:58:08] age when the anointing comes on the seed
[1:58:11] you will never stop that member of the
[1:58:13] Bride from manifesting what God has
[1:58:16] awakened in them
[1:58:17] [Applause]
[1:58:19] look if you want to keep them in
[1:58:21] something theological you better keep
[1:58:22] them away from the anointing
[1:58:25] because the minute the anointing comes
[1:58:26] something's going to wake up in them
[1:58:28] what is it it's Elohim
[1:58:31] you know that's actually what's in you
[1:58:33] right now is Elohim
[1:58:36] it is the Great
[1:58:37] Pillar of Fire
[1:58:39] the seed that was in you was always
[1:58:41] there
[1:58:43] and when this rain falls it falls on the
[1:58:46] just and the unjustment don't forget the
[1:58:48] just
[1:58:50] all right look change your focus
[1:58:54] quit worrying about the weed and preach
[1:58:58] to the seed
[1:59:00] you will never change the weed they were
[1:59:02] always weed they will always be weaned
[1:59:05] God help us to preach the life to a seed
[1:59:09] that will change their body so we can
[1:59:11] have a harvest and get out of this place
[1:59:15] what is it it's a Harvest Time
[1:59:18] it's the Harvest Time people people
[1:59:20] don't hardly care for this kind of
[1:59:22] worship but I know they don't I know
[1:59:24] they don't people often say well what
[1:59:25] right do you have worship like this
[1:59:27] anyhow y'all want to know about what my
[1:59:29] real right is I'm a son of God
[1:59:32] and as being a Son of God I am called
[1:59:34] Abraham's seed and as Abraham seed I am
[1:59:37] a royal priesthood
[1:59:40] and as a priest I have to make an
[1:59:43] offering to my God and that offering is
[1:59:46] my spiritual sacrifice of praise
[1:59:49] people so well you people put on too
[1:59:51] much for me do you know the very word
[1:59:53] sacrifice means you do it when you don't
[1:59:55] feel like it
[1:59:57] the very word sacrifice means I didn't
[2:00:01] feel like it but I did it anyhow
[2:00:04] you sacrifice just like brother runs
[2:00:07] sacrificed to be here last night to be
[2:00:09] here to he didn't feel like it but he
[2:00:12] did it anyhow because he's a priest and
[2:00:14] he sacrificed to show worship to God and
[2:00:17] listen if that man can do that in that
[2:00:20] shape
[2:00:22] you don't have one excuse tonight and
[2:00:24] why you're not praising God
[2:00:27] he said by the way you beating us up no
[2:00:29] sir I'm giving you rights if you want to
[2:00:32] praise God you've got to right to
[2:00:34] worship him to praise him to love him
[2:00:36] and serve him

[2:00:40] I'm not worthy to serve him I wasn't
[2:00:42] talking about you I was talking about
[2:00:45] him and let me ask you what has he ever
[2:00:48] done that wasn't worthy of your praise

[2:00:52] rottenness outfit sitting in this
[2:00:54] building tonight he is still Jesus

[2:01:07] my he's sitting behind me I'm gonna
[2:01:08] steal something from him amen Ron
[2:01:10] Spencer said this one time he said the
[2:01:12] only reason you got a right to not
[2:01:14] praise God is if you're dead
[2:01:17] I thought that was pretty good because
[2:01:19] the Bible said let everything that hath
[2:01:21] the breath praise ye the Lord
[2:01:28] let me ask you should we you should
[2:01:31] praise the Lord God in his sanctuary
[2:01:34] those acting unseemly in the church
[2:01:37] David said do it in the sanctuary
[2:01:41] praise God in the sanctuary in the
[2:01:44] firmament of his power praise him in his
[2:01:46] mighty acts Praise Him according to
[2:01:48] excellent greatness praise him with the
[2:01:50] sound of the trumpet Praise Him in the
[2:01:52] softer in the heart praise him with the
[2:01:54] timbrel and the dance
[2:01:58] oh maybe I didn't read that right let me
[2:02:00] read that again praise him with the
[2:02:03] timbrel and the dance
[2:02:06] I want to know
[2:02:08] I want to know somebody tell me who took
[2:02:11] dancing out of church
[2:02:14] what devil told you it was wrong to
[2:02:17] dance in church
[2:02:19] David said praise our God in the dance
[2:02:24] it's I'm reading it to you these young
[2:02:27] people shouldn't have to go to the bar
[2:02:29] to learn how to dance
[2:02:31] they shouldn't have to go to some rock
[2:02:33] and roll party to enjoy the word of God
[2:02:37] they shouldn't have to get drunk down at
[2:02:39] the alcohol and party and stand in some
[2:02:42] I see young people ain't in their
[2:02:44] pictures and they're waving they're some
[2:02:46] rock and roll God and they're standing
[2:02:48] out there with their little lights and
[2:02:49] they're waving listen we didn't come in
[2:02:51] here tonight to hold a cigarette lighter
[2:02:53] up to some rock and roll God but we
[2:02:55] brought our lives we brought our link of
[2:02:57] fire and we've come in the house of God
[2:02:59] and we're gonna wave it and we're gonna
[2:03:02] say in this Darkly odyssia somebody
[2:03:05] still Praises God as people still there
[2:03:08] and dance and scream and praise
[2:03:12] you're gonna think I'm crazy but it
[2:03:14] don't really matter to me I was a duck
[2:03:16] to begin with and I found the waters
[2:03:24] go ahead tell me who took dancing out of
[2:03:26] church what right you got to take it out
[2:03:30] David set it on to be here William
[2:03:32] Brandon said it's a sign of victory
[2:03:37] if you got enough Victory you got a
[2:03:40] right to dance thank you
[2:03:42] you're gonna rock to dance whether we
[2:03:45] got a right to dance
[2:03:48] Hallelujah we still got a ride to praise
[2:03:51] God
[2:03:53] notify hell tonight as 192 of us and
[2:03:57] agree we've got a right to praise God
[2:04:00] we're going to rock to praise him in the
[2:04:02] timber in the trumpet in the bench
[2:04:05] I won't take no for an answer I'm gonna
[2:04:08] get worship to God
[2:04:12] if I had ten thousand tongues I would
[2:04:14] praise him if I had ten thousand voices
[2:04:17] I would give them to him
[2:04:20] well you don't understand brother Wayne
[2:04:22] we can't have these young people shout
[2:04:24] like this you know in the Bible when
[2:04:26] Jesus rode into Jerusalem what the
[2:04:28] Pharisees had problems with was the
[2:04:30] noise
[2:04:31] they didn't like the young people
[2:04:33] shouting in the temple
[2:04:35] you can read it Matthew the 21st chapter
[2:04:37] and Jesus said unto them have you not
[2:04:40] read but out of the mouth of babes and
[2:04:42] sucklings thou have perfected praise
[2:04:45] you ain't even had praise until you got
[2:04:48] a young person praising
[2:04:50] you ain't even seen real praise until
[2:04:52] you see a young person that is broke out
[2:04:55] from the passions and the lust of this
[2:04:57] evil age and broke out into a realm of
[2:04:59] victory over the devil and victory over
[2:05:02] the problems in the life
[2:05:05] we're not asking for permission from the
[2:05:07] devil we have been given a right by the
[2:05:10] scripture to worship the god of Abraham
[2:05:15] we didn't ask the devil what it taught
[2:05:17] we didn't ask his permission we didn't
[2:05:20] even invite him to this meeting matter
[2:05:21] of fact you are free to leave Satan
[2:05:26] you're free to take your unbelieving
[2:05:29] spirit with you and get out of this
[2:05:31] place in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:05:42] by what Authority you go ahead and tell
[2:05:44] me about what Authority does the devil
[2:05:46] take dancing out of the church
[2:05:48] and then turn around and blame it on us
[2:05:51] like we do something wrong when we do
[2:05:53] what the scriptures told us to do
[2:05:58] I'm Taylor I'd be honestly I'm a little
[2:06:00] sick of the devil pushing this time to
[2:06:02] push back
[2:06:03] it's time for this bride Church to say
[2:06:05] we know our rights
[2:06:08] I've got a right to worship
[2:06:11] I've got a rock to praise I've got a
[2:06:14] right to quote what the prophet said
[2:06:18] by what Authority by what Authority do
[2:06:21] you do these things I tell you what we
[2:06:22] do and we do them by scripture you know
[2:06:24] the scripture tells us every Parable in
[2:06:26] the Bible is in effect right now
[2:06:29] man shall not live by word alone but
[2:06:31] every by bread alone but every word that
[2:06:34] precedes when has there ever been an age
[2:06:35] where there's been more words than today
[2:06:37] [Applause]
[2:06:38] come on the prophet of God said every
[2:06:40] Parable in the scripture was in effect
[2:06:42] right now
[2:06:44] said preacher what are you saying that
[2:06:46] I'm saying and some days you're going to
[2:06:48] have to be a shame guard
[2:06:50] [Applause]
[2:06:51] but you can't just be shame God
[2:06:55] because shamgar didn't make it all the
[2:06:57] way did he just a little piece in the
[2:06:59] scripture
[2:07:00] it was just a little part of your
[2:07:02] character I got quotes laying right here
[2:07:04] where prophet of God said you've got a
[2:07:05] right to every character that was in the
[2:07:07] scripture as a Christian
[2:07:09] you see what I'm saying some points
[2:07:11] you're going to be a David and you're
[2:07:12] going to throw your your little rock at
[2:07:14] that devil and you're going to cut his
[2:07:15] head off in other places you're going to
[2:07:17] be a marry him with a tambourine and
[2:07:19] you're going to dance on the sea other
[2:07:20] places you're going to be a Moses and
[2:07:22] you're going to prophesy and sing and
[2:07:24] praise God other places you're going to
[2:07:26] be a Hannah and you're going to cry
[2:07:28] before God other places you're going to
[2:07:30] be a Mary and you're going to say be it
[2:07:32] unto me according to Thy word other
[2:07:34] places
[2:07:37] foreign
[2:07:40] Parable doesn't explain you
[2:07:43] what scripture doesn't explain you you
[2:07:46] are the multifaceted presence of
[2:07:49] almighty God in the form of the Bride
[2:07:51] Elohim has come back in the form of a
[2:07:55] bride and here you stand with material
[2:07:58] on you
[2:08:02] now I got enough scripture to cover you
[2:08:04] up on that point
[2:08:07] Elohim it's back in the bride form
[2:08:10] bringing the fullness of that word you
[2:08:13] said preacher what are you saying I'm
[2:08:14] saying that you're the king
[2:08:18] you're the king with an Oxnard
[2:08:23] you know the prophet of God said that
[2:08:25] the Holy Ghost will get the church out
[2:08:27] of any chaos it's in
[2:08:31] to brother Wayne
[2:08:32] I'll tell you the perfect word by the
[2:08:34] Holy Ghost it won't it won't won't fix
[2:08:36] all of our trouble
[2:08:38] liar
[2:08:42] so preacher what are you saying the
[2:08:44] prophet of God said the church was given
[2:08:46] into her hand the arrow of God's
[2:08:47] deliverance and the Holy Spirit will
[2:08:49] deliver the church out of any kind of
[2:08:51] chaos it can get into
[2:08:55] anything you can get into this anointing
[2:08:58] gets you out
[2:08:59] [Applause]
[2:09:02] any problem come on Church
[2:09:04] Israel was in Egypt and God got him out
[2:09:07] [Applause]
[2:09:09] I'm preaching to you
[2:09:13] Peter was back three Realms in the
[2:09:16] prison in a dark place and the pillar of
[2:09:18] fire went and found that man
[2:09:23] come on somebody said Peter here tonight
[2:09:25] somebody that's back in that dark place
[2:09:28] back there so brother when you saying I
[2:09:30] ain't a Christian no Peter was full of
[2:09:31] the Holy Ghost
[2:09:33] but the devil had he locked up in the
[2:09:35] darkness back there
[2:09:38] but there was a prayer meeting going on
[2:09:40] for him
[2:09:42] it's a pillar of fire went after the man
[2:09:45] the anointing of God come down and Peter
[2:09:48] had already got so comfortable in the
[2:09:49] prison house he was sleeping down there
[2:09:52] yeah
[2:09:54] he thought well I'll never get out of
[2:09:55] this place but the anointing wouldn't
[2:09:57] quit brother
[2:10:00] the anointment by the way how do I know
[2:10:02] I'm a Child of God he ain't gonna quit
[2:10:04] [Applause]
[2:10:06] this ain't going to quit he won't let
[2:10:07] you get down there and get comfortable
[2:10:09] and just stay stay where you are amen he
[2:10:11] won't back off that that anointing came
[2:10:13] right he never Peter was and smote him
[2:10:15] in the sidewalked that man up and told
[2:10:17] him to get up
[2:10:21] are you hearing me if you're back there
[2:10:23] in that prison house
[2:10:25] as a child of God and that Devil's got
[2:10:27] you in a dark place the anointing is in
[2:10:31] the building and I'm telling you get out
[2:10:35] from where you are
[2:10:37] don't lay there another night
[2:10:43] look at that pillar fire went in and
[2:10:45] smoldy and when he stood up the chains
[2:10:48] fell off of him
[2:10:50] the anointing makes a difference
[2:10:53] he didn't have to beat them chains off
[2:10:55] he just got up to move and when he
[2:10:58] started moving he was a free man
[2:11:03] I'll tell you if you start moving right
[2:11:04] now you're already a free man God has
[2:11:07] already did something in this building
[2:11:09] chains are already broken
[2:11:13] what he did the Bible says the angel
[2:11:16] stopped him on the way out and made him
[2:11:18] get dressed
[2:11:21] isn't that something made him gird his
[2:11:23] loins and put his shoes on
[2:11:26] I wonder where that come from in the
[2:11:27] Bible
[2:11:28] when the angel of the Lord was leading
[2:11:30] Israel out of Egypt you know what he did
[2:11:32] he made them put their shoes on and he
[2:11:35] made them gird themselves because they
[2:11:37] was leaving there
[2:11:40] Hallelujah he wouldn't allow his
[2:11:42] children to go shoeless
[2:11:44] no sir he made him get dressed when they
[2:11:46] were leaving so as when they got out the
[2:11:48] Bible said he'd come to himself he got
[2:11:51] so carried away he didn't even know what
[2:11:52] had happened to him until he got on the
[2:11:55] outside you see what God will do he'll
[2:11:57] come to the darkest places of your life
[2:11:58] because
[2:11:59] I'm going to say something to you some
[2:12:01] of you get into places in your life amen
[2:12:03] that you shouldn't be there you should
[2:12:05] not be in that place he said preacher
[2:12:07] how does that happen do you remember you
[2:12:09] remember when brother bam talks about
[2:12:11] freeing those people out of that house
[2:12:13] of Hell how many remembers that
[2:12:15] I'll say hell remember the vision you
[2:12:18] know what happened right there that
[2:12:19] woman told Brother random said brother
[2:12:21] Brandon them are good people
[2:12:24] but they've misunderstood you
[2:12:29] said preacher what are you saying it was
[2:12:32] a misunderstanding that put them in that
[2:12:34] place
[2:12:36] and sometimes in the church things come
[2:12:38] up and people have a misunderstanding
[2:12:41] instead of straightening it out they let
[2:12:44] the devil put them in bars and it
[2:12:46] becomes a prison house to them
[2:12:51] but I feel an anointing in this building
[2:12:53] tonight
[2:12:56] see House of hell
[2:12:59] give way in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:13:03] what happened an anointing came
[2:13:09] I wish I had an hour on that
[2:13:12] look what it done it opened it some of
[2:13:13] you been under misunderstandings and
[2:13:15] doctrines
[2:13:17] some of you was in misunderstandings and
[2:13:19] it had you bound to where you couldn't
[2:13:21] even serve God the way you wanted to
[2:13:23] you're a good person but you were in a
[2:13:25] misunderstanding and it bound you but
[2:13:28] this message come to set you Liberty
[2:13:31] fear night in his anointing of freedom
[2:13:40] so brother Wayne what are you saying I'm
[2:13:41] saying there's three rounds there's a
[2:13:43] humanistic ground there's a divine
[2:13:45] revelation realm and there's a vision
[2:13:47] Realm
[2:13:48] and you can't just live in humanistic or
[2:13:51] Revelation you're going to have to have
[2:13:52] a vision
[2:13:53] you're going to have to get a vision of
[2:13:55] where you're going and what you're doing
[2:13:56] and how it's going to come do you know
[2:13:58] you're a part of this vision from the
[2:14:00] beginning
[2:14:02] do you know when God spoke certain
[2:14:04] things in the Bible he was literally
[2:14:06] talking about you
[2:14:08] come on church I I'm not a heretic you
[2:14:11] are literally in the Bible
[2:14:14] you are the bride body of Jesus Christ
[2:14:17] and Justice predestinated in his body is
[2:14:21] so is this body predestinated
[2:14:24] now come on y'all know y'all know as
[2:14:26] well as I do that that only fulfills in
[2:14:29] the end time
[2:14:31] how many knows this how many knows the
[2:14:33] Bible says in Ephesians 2 and 7 that you
[2:14:35] have been raised up to set in Heavenly
[2:14:36] places with Christ Jesus let me realize
[2:14:39] this that's not every age
[2:14:42] that is an end time scripture Jim I said
[2:14:45] well brother Wayne that's been in the
[2:14:47] Bible all them years it don't matter how
[2:14:48] long it was in the Bible it was put in
[2:14:51] the Bible in the days of Paul but it
[2:14:53] wasn't to be lived until the days of the
[2:14:55] Bride
[2:14:56] because there had to come something to
[2:14:58] lift up this bride into a position of
[2:15:02] authority
[2:15:05] come on friends that letters wasn't
[2:15:07] going to do it but the same Pillar of
[2:15:10] Fire that led the children of Israel out
[2:15:12] of Egypt into Israel into the promised
[2:15:15] land was the same Pillar of Fire that
[2:15:17] came to your home and began to lift you
[2:15:20] in the word to a position of authority
[2:15:25] ah I know people say to me all the time
[2:15:28] so bro ain't short to me in the Bible I
[2:15:30] think it's powerful I'm I'm going to
[2:15:31] borrow something from your pastor here I
[2:15:33] think it's powerful read Revelations the
[2:15:35] 10th chapter
[2:15:37] read Revelations 10. you got that you
[2:15:39] got that picture of Michael of that
[2:15:41] great Cloud read Revelations 10 read the
[2:15:43] first couple verses of scripture and
[2:15:45] look what look what it says in
[2:15:46] Revelations 10 it said a mighty Angel
[2:15:48] come down out of heaven
[2:15:51] clothed with a cloud
[2:15:54] clothed with a cloud y'all know you're
[2:15:56] looking at the picture of Revelations
[2:15:58] the 10th chapter
[2:16:01] you were clothed with a cloud now this
[2:16:03] is a beautiful thing to me because this
[2:16:06] represents the headship of the church
[2:16:10] now somebody said well brother Wayne
[2:16:12] what are you talking about brother
[2:16:13] Graham said that's our headship
[2:16:15] he said now what revealed these seals
[2:16:18] was not the intelligence of a man it was
[2:16:20] the quickening power of God right and
[2:16:24] this Cloud was the Heavenly announcement
[2:16:26] of what was happening on the earth
[2:16:28] headship had come to the church and a
[2:16:32] body is positioned under a head
[2:16:35] come on Brad hey man so what are you
[2:16:38] talking about preacher well if you took
[2:16:40] your driver's license out right now and
[2:16:41] I said who are you you show me a picture
[2:16:43] of your face don't you
[2:16:45] come on now this is not a picture amen
[2:16:48] of the Cross this is not a picture of
[2:16:50] doves this is not a picture of eagles
[2:16:52] this is a picture of the face of Jesus
[2:16:55] Christ with the wig of seven angels
[2:16:58] teaching the supreme authority of Jesus
[2:17:02] Christ now the beautiful thing here is
[2:17:04] amen that that is only a picture of the
[2:17:07] head
[2:17:09] where is the body
[2:17:16] that's the end but you're the body
[2:17:19] come on church not just the body the
[2:17:22] anointed body
[2:17:25] anointed by what the same Pillar of Fire
[2:17:31] that was in the beginning you say
[2:17:33] preacher where is that Pillar of Fire
[2:17:34] I'm looking for it I'm looking at it
[2:17:38] I'm not looking for the pillar of fire
[2:17:40] I'm looking at the pillar of Fire
[2:17:44] now I got enough scripture to cover you
[2:17:46] up I know exactly where I'm at you are
[2:17:48] the amorphic form of Jesus Christ in
[2:17:51] this age the bride body which the son of
[2:17:54] man is now manifesting himself not in
[2:17:58] one man but a many-membered body the son
[2:18:01] of man is increasing in the body of
[2:18:04] Jesus Christ the pillar of fire is now
[2:18:07] where does the vision say the pillar of
[2:18:09] fire be look at Moses tent Vision what
[2:18:12] does the tent Vision say the pillar of
[2:18:13] fire be it'll be in that little room
[2:18:17] that little room is the soul where is
[2:18:20] the pillar of fire today brother Wayne
[2:18:21] it's in the adopted sons of God
[2:18:24] the pillar of fire is now dwelling in
[2:18:27] the Church of the Living God
[2:18:30] in his body
[2:18:34] who are you
[2:18:37] tell me who I am
[2:18:39] [Applause]
[2:18:40] I like this I love this little part
[2:18:43] right here look what he said and he had
[2:18:45] his hand a little book excuse me let's
[2:18:47] go back to that first verse and a
[2:18:49] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[2:18:52] were as the sun and his feet
[2:18:56] and his feet
[2:18:58] and his feet
[2:19:00] come on what is the feet of a man it's a
[2:19:04] part of the body
[2:19:06] and his feet as pillars of Fire come on
[2:19:11] church where is his feet where is the
[2:19:14] pillars of fire that's connected to
[2:19:16] Revelations 10 it's setting in this room
[2:19:20] it's the Heavenly Pride groom it's the
[2:19:22] Earthly Pride she is the body of Jesus
[2:19:26] Christ on the earth look at this I tell
[2:19:29] you this you this so by the way someday
[2:19:31] we're going to get in the Millennium and
[2:19:32] there's a great Authority that's a great
[2:19:34] anointing going to come on the church
[2:19:35] amen I agree we're going to do it in the
[2:19:37] anointing but you're missing something
[2:19:40] the Bible said beloved now we are the
[2:19:44] sons of God not what we shall be but
[2:19:47] what we are right now you are the
[2:19:50] anointed body and the devil's trying his
[2:19:53] best to hide this from you
[2:19:55] he's trying to put it in another age
[2:19:57] he's trying to say well someday when
[2:19:59] brother Branham comes back with a tent
[2:20:01] the vision's going to happen and we're
[2:20:03] going to have a great Revival and
[2:20:04] everything's going to be good and that's
[2:20:06] going to take place it's a lie the
[2:20:08] devil's trying to throw you off for the
[2:20:10] position that God has given you in this
[2:20:12] age because you are the feet that is
[2:20:15] supposed to tread upon the head of The
[2:20:18] Serpent and the age we're living in I
[2:20:21] tell you what this pillars of fire has
[2:20:23] been anointed to place their feet upon
[2:20:26] the hand of the devil in the age we're
[2:20:28] living in you are serpent stomping Holy
[2:20:31] Ghost Field Church
[2:20:34] foreign
[2:20:40] what are you saying I'm saying right now
[2:20:43] right now you're anointed your anointed
[2:20:46] Kings of God right now can I can I
[2:20:49] finish by saying this to you right now
[2:20:51] your sons right now you're Kings you say
[2:20:54] brother Wayne I don't feel like I have
[2:20:56] any Dominion at all but you do
[2:20:59] you say what is your decision your
[2:21:01] Dominion's over the flesh
[2:21:03] [Applause]
[2:21:05] you're the minionist you are a Believer
[2:21:07] how many Believers of God your Dominion
[2:21:09] is over the flesh he overcame so you
[2:21:12] overcame the flesh
[2:21:16] I I'm sorry I I don't want to make fun
[2:21:19] of people but I I have to be honest with
[2:21:21] you people tell me some stupid things
[2:21:22] sometimes
[2:21:24] and they said well by the way and I'm
[2:21:25] afraid you're going to get in the flesh
[2:21:27] up there shouting and hollering
[2:21:29] well hello
[2:21:33] I am a flesh man
[2:21:36] and as long as I'm in this body whatever
[2:21:39] I do
[2:21:41] will be in the flesh the same flesh that
[2:21:44] Wars the same flesh that don't want to
[2:21:46] get up and come to church the same flesh
[2:21:49] that don't want to be nice the same
[2:21:50] flesh that wants to war every day of Our
[2:21:53] Lives but there is something on the
[2:21:55] inside that is making this thing come
[2:21:58] subject to the word of God why is it
[2:22:01] brother it's the anointing
[2:22:05] so you know what I'll do I'll dance in
[2:22:08] the flesh I shot in the flesh I praise
[2:22:12] God in the flesh
[2:22:14] I'm not just gonna do it in a theophany
[2:22:16] brother I'm not just going to do it
[2:22:18] anymore nobody but in this Mortal body I
[2:22:22] will bring it subject to the word of God
[2:22:24] and I say you are going to worship the
[2:22:27] god of Abraham
[2:22:36] in million over the flesh over sin
[2:22:40] over the world and I really like this
[2:22:43] one over the devil
[2:22:47] it's written in the word you would have
[2:22:49] over the devil he said preacher over the
[2:22:53] devil do you know brother random said
[2:22:54] that Jesus was raised up to the right
[2:22:56] hand of God he said in this body was set
[2:22:59] over Satan in authority and Power
[2:23:04] even if you're the skin
[2:23:07] on the bottom of the feet you are still
[2:23:12] over the devil
[2:23:16] you said preacher what does that mean
[2:23:18] then that means that that pornography
[2:23:21] happened tonight you've got a right to
[2:23:23] put your foot on that thing and say
[2:23:26] you'll never
[2:23:29] you might have took this one you might
[2:23:31] have took that one but because of the
[2:23:34] anointing you cannot bring an arrow nor
[2:23:38] can you enter the path
[2:23:42] I believe you got a ride to put your
[2:23:45] foot on it I believe it I believe you
[2:23:47] young people got a rock that put your
[2:23:49] foot on fashion I believe you got it
[2:23:51] right you sit here with an alcohol habit
[2:23:53] tonight you got a right to put your foot
[2:23:55] on it
[2:23:56] so I can't quit these cigarettes brother
[2:23:59] Wayne listen you can't quit it amen as a
[2:24:01] man but if you'll left this anointing in
[2:24:03] your life as a power from the pillar of
[2:24:06] fire it'll make you the son you ought to
[2:24:08] be and it'll give you authority over
[2:24:10] every demon
[2:24:11] [Applause]
[2:24:17] let me tell you we're the subject we're
[2:24:19] just subject to everything in this age
[2:24:21] that's a lie
[2:24:23] we are not subject to this devil
[2:24:27] we may have to live here but we don't
[2:24:29] live under the Dominion of sin
[2:24:32] we live under the Dominion of Christ
[2:24:34] where he shows himself alive let me ask
[2:24:37] y'all something what good is it for us
[2:24:39] to preach the god of Elijah if he ain't
[2:24:41] still alive
[2:24:43] what good is it us to stand up here and
[2:24:46] talk about what a God was and how good
[2:24:48] he done and what great things he done
[2:24:50] unless we're willing to challenge that
[2:24:52] devil in our generation and say the same
[2:24:55] God that delivered them in the days of
[2:24:58] Moses is that God here tonight the God
[2:25:01] that was in the days of David it's the
[2:25:03] god that's here tonight I tell you the
[2:25:05] God that was in the Days of Elijah is
[2:25:07] still the god of Elijah
[2:25:12] I wish guys a better preacher to uplift
[2:25:14] him like this but I'll tell you this I
[2:25:17] have personally seen the god of Elijah
[2:25:21] I have personally witnessed it I have
[2:25:24] seen that God come down and materialize
[2:25:26] right in my own family
[2:25:30] not only do you save me I don't even
[2:25:32] fill me with the Holy Ghost not only did
[2:25:34] I see the mercies of God but just a
[2:25:36] couple years ago my son and
[2:25:38] daughter-in-law were praying for a baby
[2:25:40] praying for a baby praying for a baby
[2:25:41] God expecting a baby and lost a baby
[2:25:44] expected another baby lost the baby I
[2:25:47] think they went to it two or three times
[2:25:48] it was a nightmare on those kids
[2:25:50] people started saying well she has some
[2:25:53] kind of disease from her family line
[2:25:54] she'll never be able to do it and and
[2:25:56] she that poor little thing we lived
[2:25:58] there I watched her from month to month
[2:26:00] amen just every little bit I watched
[2:26:02] this I watched this go on I was praying
[2:26:04] for him asking God for him and you know
[2:26:06] you know you might not realize how
[2:26:09] special a special meeting is
[2:26:12] but a special meeting could be a change
[2:26:14] in your life
[2:26:16] yeah we invited brother Erickson invited
[2:26:18] brother Spencer to come up and hold a
[2:26:20] special meeting for us and we were
[2:26:22] having a little prayer line there and
[2:26:23] I'm standing there by brother Ron and in
[2:26:25] my heart I'm saying God if you're going
[2:26:28] to give them babies give us a baby to
[2:26:30] Anna and Zach let them come up in this
[2:26:32] prayer line today
[2:26:33] and no one I said that Zach popped up
[2:26:36] and got Anna by the hand and brother Jim
[2:26:38] Bowie come down and stood right there
[2:26:39] and we started praying for him
[2:26:41] well we didn't pray for him but just a
[2:26:43] few minutes and brother Ron kind of
[2:26:45] stepped back with a funny look on his
[2:26:46] face
[2:26:48] and he said Anna you'll have that child
[2:26:50] in the name of the Lord
[2:26:52] well I just started thanking God
[2:26:56] I just started thinking a lot a few days
[2:26:58] later we were out there in September we
[2:27:00] were working on brother Wendell's at
[2:27:02] parking lot on the grader and I was
[2:27:03] listening to a tape and I was sitting
[2:27:05] there thinking about that whole thing it
[2:27:07] was the following September I'm sitting
[2:27:09] there thinking about that whole thing
[2:27:10] and it could have been a May instead of
[2:27:11] October made but we were we were sitting
[2:27:13] there thinking about that and the spirit
[2:27:14] of the Lord came in there and confirmed
[2:27:16] he said you'll have that child
[2:27:18] I thought my goodness this is powerful
[2:27:20] the following February we went to
[2:27:22] Brother Ron's church and while I was
[2:27:24] preaching I just announced to the whole
[2:27:26] church and said hey yo I'm a grandpa
[2:27:28] and they was all looking at me kind of
[2:27:30] funny I said no I don't have any
[2:27:31] pregnancy tests but I got some faith
[2:27:35] I got some faith
[2:27:39] and brother Ron Howard's off the back
[2:27:41] pew it's on video he brought around
[2:27:44] hollers back and he said that's the
[2:27:46] saith the Lord Brother Wayne
[2:27:48] and I stepped back said what'd you say
[2:27:50] and he said let's saith the Lord I said
[2:27:53] well we'll send you a pregnancy test
[2:27:54] when it comes and they did
[2:27:57] and they did
[2:27:58] and it wasn't long after that brother
[2:28:00] Ron told me so brother Rayne the reason
[2:28:01] I was so sure is God showed me a vision
[2:28:03] standing there at the platform that day
[2:28:05] I said well thank God for that
[2:28:07] it's not human real I'm not Revelation
[2:28:09] realm it's another realm altogether
[2:28:12] do you know just uh February two years
[2:28:16] now in February be two years we had
[2:28:19] little Evelyn you got a picture brother
[2:28:21] Michael we had little Evelyn coming to
[2:28:23] the into the Earth God gave us because
[2:28:26] our God is still the god of Elijah
[2:28:36] that's Evelyn Marie
[2:28:39] brother Ron's dedicating Evelyn
[2:28:42] we got an updated pitcher and maybe one
[2:28:45] more high and she killed
[2:28:54] so brother Wayne what's wrong with you
[2:28:55] listen I want that devil to know I know
[2:28:57] the God that I serve gave us that baby
[2:29:01] every time I pick her up I tell the
[2:29:04] devil God gave this one to me
[2:29:08] now now little Evelyn come along
[2:29:11] and the Holy Spirit began to move and
[2:29:14] you know what's amazing is Nathan's
[2:29:16] standing right back there Nathan and
[2:29:17] Cheyenne was had a baby Rowan who's with
[2:29:21] him now and they wanted to have another
[2:29:22] and they were having trouble after
[2:29:24] trouble after trouble and they went to
[2:29:26] the doctor and the doctor said it's a
[2:29:27] very I don't know what the percentages
[2:29:28] was but it was a high percentage that
[2:29:31] they would never be able to have another
[2:29:32] child they were surprised they had the
[2:29:33] first one
[2:29:34] and he and he said in his heart he felt
[2:29:37] God he Brother Ray was preaching one day
[2:29:39] he was sitting there and something came
[2:29:40] to him that he was going to have a child
[2:29:42] he was going to have another one
[2:29:43] and he said he said I had that little
[2:29:45] bit of Faith God's going to give it to
[2:29:46] me but then we went down in in the uh
[2:29:49] the I think it was somewhere around
[2:29:50] March or may something like that went
[2:29:52] down to brother Nathan Bryants in
[2:29:54] Jeffersonville and we preached a meeting
[2:29:56] down there and brother Nathan went with
[2:29:57] us on the Saturday night of the meeting
[2:29:59] we had a prayer line and Nathan come
[2:30:02] through the prayer line but when he came
[2:30:03] through God moved in a very Supernatural
[2:30:07] way we went down afterwards and
[2:30:09] sometimes preachers fall apart after
[2:30:10] meetings you know we went down into the
[2:30:12] basement and when we were sitting down
[2:30:14] there he come and laid over
[2:30:15] coming late over the desk and started
[2:30:18] wailing out in the spirit of God and
[2:30:19] Rose up and said brother Wayne God has
[2:30:21] confirmed to me tonight in this prayer
[2:30:23] line I'll have another child
[2:30:25] and tonight we have a little Rosemary
[2:30:28] back there with Cheyenne if you want to
[2:30:31] see her the pictures on there for the
[2:30:32] screen audience but they're sitting
[2:30:34] there tonight holding the supernatural
[2:30:37] in their hands
[2:30:39] because my God
[2:30:42] is still the god of Elijah
[2:30:49] he cares
[2:30:53] that lying devil
[2:30:56] he still does I was last year uh two
[2:30:59] years August now has been a year Brother
[2:31:01] David Mayer and I were preaching a
[2:31:03] meeting up in Mount Baker for Cloverdale
[2:31:05] there brother bisco and brother Tom and
[2:31:07] in brother Ryan Hayes as their musician
[2:31:10] he was a song leader he was setting over
[2:31:12] there playing music and on the Sunday
[2:31:14] morning I was preaching on visions and I
[2:31:17] started telling that congregation the
[2:31:19] testimony about Evelyn and when I
[2:31:21] started telling that I looked over at
[2:31:24] him and I had noticed through the
[2:31:25] weekend he was under something heavy I
[2:31:28] didn't know what it was didn't have a
[2:31:29] clue what he was going through he told
[2:31:32] the testimony a year later he said what
[2:31:34] has happened was they had had about
[2:31:36] three or four miscarriages and they were
[2:31:38] just they were just racked with this and
[2:31:41] they didn't know what to do didn't know
[2:31:42] how to handle it he said we're just
[2:31:44] about to give up on it well while I was
[2:31:46] telling this testimony on the Sunday
[2:31:48] morning the last service the spirit of
[2:31:51] God began to drop in the building he
[2:31:53] said brother Wayne God spoke to me and
[2:31:56] said you will have a son and call his
[2:31:59] name Samuel
[2:32:02] one year later
[2:32:04] here's that baby
[2:32:10] said preacher what are you saying I'm
[2:32:12] saying the anointing made a difference
[2:32:16] because 192 light beams come together
[2:32:19] there was a power dropped in that room
[2:32:23] she was Barren when she came in but she
[2:32:26] was fruitful when she left
[2:32:29] there are people sitting in this room
[2:32:31] you may be going through some of the
[2:32:33] greatest Trials of your life but you're
[2:32:35] in a place for change God still changes
[2:32:39] Hearts it still changes lives he still
[2:32:42] delivers souls he still brings the
[2:32:44] captive and sets him free
[2:32:52] 20 years ago Bryce Collins and his wife
[2:32:55] was wanting a child she couldn't have
[2:32:57] one I was preaching a meeting and I
[2:33:00] began to just preach like this and I
[2:33:02] sing they're sitting there as younger
[2:33:03] lady her husband wasn't a pastor then
[2:33:05] and I looked at her and I said sister
[2:33:07] God can fix whatever's wrong with that
[2:33:10] body and he can give you that baby and I
[2:33:12] was doing that I had no clue what she
[2:33:14] was wanting or Desiring but when I said
[2:33:16] that amen about a year later she came to
[2:33:19] Arkansas and handed me a baby and she
[2:33:22] said here is the baby you said I could
[2:33:24] have because our God is still the god of
[2:33:28] Elijah
[2:33:30] and I don't care what line devil says
[2:33:34] that he's not that kind of God he's
[2:33:36] scared of God that Reigns and rules he
[2:33:40] is still a supernatural Almighty
[2:33:43] powerful God
[2:33:47] I do not look for a decrease in
[2:33:49] anointing I do not look for a backing up
[2:33:52] in this message but I look for those
[2:33:54] that have desired it to see a greater
[2:33:57] anointing and a greater power and a
[2:33:59] greater Revival
[2:34:00] [Applause]
[2:34:06] I believe change is here
[2:34:09] [Applause]
[2:34:10] because of the anointing
[2:34:13] I can say to you you won't leave here
[2:34:15] like you came
[2:34:15] [Applause]
[2:34:18] you can begin to agree together right
[2:34:20] here in this building
[2:34:22] you may have walked in this room with a
[2:34:24] habit you leave here without it tonight
[2:34:27] because the anointing just because other
[2:34:29] people have fell under that and they
[2:34:31] can't get up don't mean you have to
[2:34:34] I'm preaching to you just cause your
[2:34:36] daddy took that kind of attitude and
[2:34:38] went that direction don't mean you have
[2:34:40] to you do not have to go that way I
[2:34:43] don't care how you were born I don't
[2:34:45] care who your parents were there was a
[2:34:47] seed in you to be a child to begin with
[2:34:50] and the DNA of Elohim is in this bride
[2:34:54] and under this anointing there's
[2:34:56] something that will change you put it in
[2:34:58] a prison house God will get them out put
[2:35:00] them in Egypt God will get them out put
[2:35:03] them in a guns and God will get them out
[2:35:04] put them in sickness gotta get them out
[2:35:06] he's the god of Abraham and there's none
[2:35:10] like him that can
[2:35:12] ain't nobody ain't nothing like this God
[2:35:15] that we're serving here tonight
[2:35:20] I stand before you as a witness that God
[2:35:22] is still alive
[2:35:24] he can take a drunk and make a preacher
[2:35:26] out of him
[2:35:27] he can take the immoral and make a moral
[2:35:35] he can completely change you
[2:35:37] [Applause]
[2:35:41] the musicians come
[2:35:44] the anointing
[2:35:46] makes
[2:35:48] a difference
[2:35:51] because
[2:35:53] of the anointing
[2:35:57] so brother Wayne how do you think things
[2:35:59] because of the anointing
[2:36:02] how do you think things could because of
[2:36:04] the anointing
[2:36:06] but Isaiah you don't understand Israel
[2:36:08] just got attacked and everybody was
[2:36:09] carried away and we're gonna
[2:36:12] because of the anointing
[2:36:19] so you know what that tells me
[2:36:22] let the anointing loose
[2:36:34] a few years ago I don't want you to
[2:36:35] think I'm a nut
[2:36:37] just a few years ago there in True Word
[2:36:39] Tabernacle up in Ohio
[2:36:41] I was preaching on a Thursday night
[2:36:43] and I looked over
[2:36:45] and there was a man come walking out of
[2:36:47] the wall walked right down through the
[2:36:49] room he never stepped over a pinch he
[2:36:51] never he never stepped over a person he
[2:36:53] just walked right through the crowd
[2:36:56] said preacher what are you say and I'm
[2:36:57] saying the angel the Lord still walks in
[2:36:59] rooms
[2:37:03] so I don't know about all that
[2:37:04] Supernatural stuff I was preaching one
[2:37:06] day and the congregation was a little
[2:37:07] quiet my mind I was sitting there saying
[2:37:09] I might have I got the right scripture
[2:37:10] have I got the right scripture did I
[2:37:12] take the right direction and no more
[2:37:14] than I said that a light flashed over
[2:37:15] the pulpit zigzag across my Bible and
[2:37:18] went like that
[2:37:19] I said Thank You Lord and I kept
[2:37:21] standing there with the word
[2:37:25] these things are real
[2:37:27] [Applause]
[2:37:31] cause of the anointing
[2:37:35] that's why we stand here today
[2:37:38] cause
[2:37:40] of the anointing
