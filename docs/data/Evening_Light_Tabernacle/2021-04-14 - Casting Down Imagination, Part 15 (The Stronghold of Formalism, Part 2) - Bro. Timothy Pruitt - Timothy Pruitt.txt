for the healings that you brought in our midst lord and the deliverances and lord the angel of god that walks among us and speaks to us lord and talks to us tells us everything's going to be all right god what a confidence that is the lord we just ask that you would take these words and these thoughts lord and our insignificant lord and humanity father under your control and for your glory in jesus name amen amen let's turn to second corinthians 10 and also romans 9. amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen i said it's good to be in the house of the lord amen i just so enjoyed the easter weekend meetings and and the outpouring of the holy ghost upon our lives it's a place we really enjoy being humanity's presence amen then wednesday night last wednesday night just wonderful and sunday as well i was away at brother jason jackson's uh church as his youngest daughter got married and so he was part of that wedding and and uh brother danny steven minister there that sunday had a wonderful time there as well and bring his greetings back to you amen so let's just look at this second corinthians 10 and verse 4 it says for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ also romans 9 and verse 13. as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated amen let's let you be seated this evening i'd like to speak to you again on casting down imaginations and also on the stronghold of formalism on the stronghold of formalism we we spoke on this the last time like to continue this thought and you know as a scripture says as christians or as believers we're to cast down imaginations you know mind battles that comes in our mind and wars against us and and you know maybe different avenues that he can come at you but we know that we are to take those thoughts and those thoughts any thought that does not line up with the word of god is not god's thoughts and so we're to cast those thoughts down and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god in other words even if our own mind our own intellect would try to exalt itself above the word of god we are to bring it back down into the place that it belongs and bring it into captivity every thought can somebody say every thought every thought to the obedience of christ now we're living in a world that is not obeying that scripture their thoughts and their thinking is on evil continually and they're exalting the things of of hell the things of the of the dimensions of hell above the word of god and and there and and they're bringing a certain atmosphere into the world that we're living in and we can read about that in second timothy 3 and verse 1 and i'm going to read out of the amplified because it's very interesting here it says but understand this that in the last days will come or set in perilous times of great stress and trouble that is hard to deal with and hard to bear for people will be lovers of self and utterly self-centered lovers of money and aroused by inordinate greedy desire for wealth proud and arrogant and contemptuous boasters they will be abusive they will be blasphemous they will be scoffers disobedient to parents ungrateful unholy and profane they will be without natural human affection callous and inhuman relentless a meaning of no truth or appeasement they will be slanders false accusers troublemakers intemperate and loosened morals and conduct uncontrolled fierce and haters of good they will be treacherous betrayers rash and inflated with self-conceit they will be lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amusements more than and rather than lovers of god for although they hold a form of piety or true religion they deny and reject and are strangers to the power of it their conduct belies the genuineness of their profession avoid all such people and turn away from them amen so we see a people whose minds have went to the place to where they no longer can control their thinking they no longer control their thoughts until they they become a very abusive or proud or are arrogant or blasphemous or are scoffers and and become false accusers and troublemakers and and all the things that take but yet having a form of godliness you know that kind of puts it in a different language or a different thought because in our minds we would look at those people and we would think of them as being those out on the streets and doing all the writing that's going on amen but these are actually people who have all these issues and all these things in their hearts and their lives but yet having a form of godliness and you know and having a form that their religion is just a formality it's a a formality i'm i'm going to appease my christian duty you know i'm going to go and do something for the lord you know i it was a it's kind of it's kind of a almost it's so so crazy it's humorous in a way but there was a man that actually used to attend a message church and and he had disappeared on the weekend and they asked him you know what where were you okay everything all right and he said yeah he said i've been serving the lord real hard so i took a weekend off and whit got drunk that's that's you know their their thought of spiritual religion or our religious duties amen we want more than that amen and so you know these kind are very carnal although they put on the air of being spiritual and yet in their hearts they're very carnal and their minds are very carnal but yet on their mouth as they would speak you would think maybe there's a very spiritual person but if you would look on the inside you would see really what the darkness that's really on the inside of them and very you know and these same people are very quick to judge but they don't want to be judged you know they're very quick to see a moving of the holy ghost and god falling upon the hearts of me of love sisters or brothers and they're very quick to look at that and say that's an evil spirit but on the inside of them they don't want to be judged they don't want god to have preeminence in their lives on the inside of them they have all of these carnalities and and this carnality brings to the forefront complexes and pride that is what guides them and yet all in in the pretense of religion and but if their religion is more about themselves and how they think god should operate and if god didn't come through the channel of their humanity or their complex or their human restraint then it can't be god but god don't always work that way god goes beyond our thinking he goes beyond what we thought in our little box as it would be and he goes around that many times and he what we call blows our mind amen it goes past what you know what we can think or ask and i'm grateful to serve a god like that i'm glad i don't serve a god that's only he's only he can only operate the way i want him to operate or he won't only can move the way i feel like he should move but he can go wherever he wants to however he wants to fall however he wants to and god can move upon hearts and lives very freely and i wanted god like that but you know i saw this statement that i thought was very interesting it says formalism is an impersonal outlook which misses the point where the things of god are concerned it actually diverts people's attention and affection from from what's important to what's unimportant it diverts their attention from the wine to the wine skins amen from the movement of the spirit to what to their own feelings or what they're comfortable with or their comfort zone listen god wants you to get out of your comfort zone he wants you to get out of what you think is in order or what you think is church order or you know you know even brother branham would talk about he said i hope you can get out of order just long enough to get long enough to get saved but people are so caught up in their own thinking and their own concepts of what order is and many times it's according to their complexes or it's according to what they think or their own human failures or their own human understandings but we can see the spirit of formalism all the way through the scriptures we talked about it in cain and abel as abel and cain would begin to worship and and abel's offering was accepted by god because of a spiritual revelation but cain looked at that and he had the opportunity to go get a lamb he had an opportunity to offer the same sacrifice because god said you know if thou does well you will be accepted god gave him the opportunity to have that same kind of worship but he refused it and in doing so and not only did he refuse it he would take it and he would take a stone and he would kill abel right there at that altar and you know we see it all the way down to the scriptures we we read about it here as we in this script very short scripture that we read about jacob and esau in in the scripture would say jack jacob have i loved and esau if i hate him you can watch the same spirit of formalism go right on town all the way down through balaam all the way down even to judas all the way down to the church ages all the way down to the ending of the age and we see it though working in the people and and it's trying what is formalism trying to do is trying to stop the moving of the spirit of god it's trying to hinder the freeness of the spirit of god it's trying to put it in a certain chain or a certain box in a certain realm and that's the only way it can operate but god doesn't operate that way god will fall down in 120 amen in the upper room and get them so drunk that people would think they were drunk on some wine amen but see it was beyond their human ability and their human thinking but it was how god had orchestrated it and how god wanted to do it and i'm so thankful he's a god that he'll do what he wants to do even even if it isn't what we want or even if it isn't what somebody else wants but god can move beyond the walls of human thinking beyond the walls of human understanding but we see you know it's amazing we see a world that's so quick to judge a situation and we see it it's not you know it's not no more innocent until proven guilty it's guilty until maybe you didn't do it you know and we see a world so quick to cancel people you know with this council culture and totally silencing anything that's sane or anything that's a sensible voice and that spirit of judgment wants to come into the church of god and he wants to judge the spirit of god and he wants to judge the fruits of the spirit and it wants to judge the manifestations of the spirit and wants to judge it very quickly amen without even seeing what the fruits of it is and meanwhile you know these same ones have sins and unbeliefs and and they have and and they have sins but yet they're holding stones you know uh you know it was a man one time went to a a brother and and actually you know the you know him very well if i called his name and he went to his church on on a sunday and he came from a another church that was real formal and didn't have a whole lot of worship in it and he sat there and criticized their worship and criticized their music and criticized what was going on and you know and again the brother the pastor takes him out to uh to eat there afterwards and begins to talk to him and he begins to open up to him and tell him about what's wrong with his church and what's wrong you know to the pastor you got this wrong in your church you got that wrong and the music was rock and roll and all this stuff and this pastor looks at him and says on a certain certain day at a certain certain time he was looking at a certain certain website he said his head just dropped see they have sins but they got stones and they want to stone the people of god and just like cain did against abel because you know what is it they don't want their sins judged amen but you know as we see though the carnal is once again rising up against the spiritual church of god and is trying to kill the influence of the spiritual church of god they're mocking the spiritual movement of the holy ghost they're mocking the moving of the holy ghost they're mocking the moving of that the god could fall down in a congregation and someone could speak in tongues and someone interpreted they're mocking that they're making fun of that they're mocking amen a man getting up behind a pulpit and beginning to pray and the anointing of god fall upon his life and they begin to say things under the unction of the holy ghost and they're mocking that what is it it's the carnal church rising up against the supernatural church brother brandon would talk about this in the ephesians and summery and age about the carnal and the spiritual and he would talk about the cycle of revival and death has never failed he said you talk about the last move of god and the in the spirit when men and women dressed like christians and they went to church and they prayed all night and they took the street corners they weren't they were not ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left those old dead churches and worshipping homes or old store buildings they had a reality but it wasn't long to a time they began to get enough money and they built fine new churches they put a choir instead of singing them to god for themselves they put gowns on the choir they organized a movement and ran it by man oh my they soon began to read books it wasn't fit to read and they let down the bars and the goats come in and took over and the cry of joy was gone the freedom of the spirit of god was gone but they kept with a form they kept with the form but the fire has died down and the blackness of ashes is all that is about lift oh it's a form of what used to be and how it used to be you know i'd never forget it when we had that that family camp over there for the first of those few years and in the nazarene camp and i believe it was one of the very first years one of the men that was working there came and was part of our one of our services and sat there right there in the back and just cried and cried goes out and tells one of our deacons said we used to have services just like this you know they had a marker there on that place i believe it was a buddy robertson that ministered there they used to have the movement of the holy ghost they used to have the manifestations of the spirit but they began to clamp down on it and say well this is out of order this is not this is not what we want they didn't want their lives judged no more they didn't want god moving freely they didn't want god casting out devils in their lives you know somebody wants to say that well that's an evil spirit well i i agree we had some evil spirits here they manifested out in lives but they were everyone cast out that's what the power of god does amen but you see he said he goes in the sumerian church age he says the church has departed from what she originally was she's now a hybrid the church nominal is a hybrid people say i'm a baptist it wasn't so in the beginning i'm a methodist it wasn't so in the beginning now it's a i'm a message believer let's don't make that just a cliche that's more than just a form that's a life [Music] it wasn't so in the beginning instead of the straight word of god instead of spirit-filled men in the church who were led by spirit given revelation there were now creeds and bylaws and educated guesses of educated men learning has taken the place of revelation reason has taken the place of faith program has taken the place of spontaneous praise in the holy ghost oh now we see what the problem is it gets in the way of our programs we want to sing two songs take up the offer sing two songs and have a minister come out we got a program what about the holy ghost let him get beyond your program let him get beyond what you expect on a wednesday night or a sunday night let him get beyond what we think we get so programmed you know we got to get up on monday and do this on that we program you know we programmed on our phones we're programmed on this we're programmed on that program pro god doesn't do programs he doesn't do man-made creeds and man-made dictations and men make dogmas and man-made ways of how to run a service got to go right beyond all of that it wasn't so from the beginning he says but the whole specie has changed it's become a hybrid church the church becomes hybridized will it produce pure christians it can't the seed or the life that brings christians to birth is not in them like brings forth like brings forth like that's right so i mean if you want god to bring forth god you've got to have god there you know a dog brings forth a dog cat brings forth a cat human brings forth a human that can be debatable sometimes but that's supposed to be what's supposed to be humans bring forth humans god brings forth god amen but he says light brings forth light so baptist brings forth more baptists and they act like baptists methodists bring forth more methodists and they act like methodists that's why we see people amen continuing right on they said well i'm a messy believer but they're continuing right on as a baptist they got their programs i got the way it's supposed to be and how god's supposed to act how god's supposed to orchestrate things and it apparently doesn't matter if i come to church when the doors are open i'm a baptist yeah i'm a methodist i got my message but apparently god has changed his methods and this no longer matters you know about our dress and the way we act and the way you know but i'm a methodist you're showing who you really are you may come to this church but you're showing who you really are amen methodists they act like methodists not one is known by the power of god nor can they be for is not there they are known by their ceremonial worship of god and their creeds and dogmas he's going to talk about a hybrid you know the most famous hybrid in the world it's been for with us for ages is a mule it's a and it's a cross between a donkey and a horse he's a funny kind of animal he cannot produce himself he has no life that can do that yet talk about work he can outwork anybody but he's stubborn oh man maybe we need to preach on the stubborn the stronghold of stubbornness amen a lot of you wouldn't be living with devils as long as you have you wasn't so stubborn because there is a power here to cast him out amen because we got to get beyond our stubbornness and our our wills and our wants and our way it's not about what we want it's about all he wants stubborn you never can trust him oh he's a perfect pitcher good lands to go along a lot of ways with that help me lord he's a perfect pitcher of a hybrid religion a cross between between truth and darkness for the horse is a true type of the true believer and he says mix them and you have a sterile formal religion it hasn't the seed of life it is dead it can talk about truth but it can't produce truth it doesn't have god in its myths yet it gathers together it talks about god all the while systematically denying the power of god they will deny the word in the very name of the lord and there's never any hope for them it talks about religions and organized religions how they died they'll never come back he talks about it and it reads the scripture in exodus the 13th chapter 13 verse he said ever firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and thou shalt not redeem it then thou shalt break its neck and all the firstborn among men among thy children thou shalt redeem he says see the donkey can be redeemed every miserable sinner can be redeemed by the blood sacrifice of jesus christ or in rejecting christ be rejecting himself but you don't redeem the mule there's no redemption for him there's no blood for him there can't be because a mule takes refuge in the church while the donkey takes refuge in the blood the mule has no seed in him that can be quickened but the donkey has seed oh they had seminaries they filled them with professors who taught the word of god in order to destroy it he said he read an article it was written by an unsaved businessman now listen that unsafe businessman not a christian he said he was amazed at the churches and he could not understand them he said they had seminaries filled with professors who taught the word of god in order to destroy it now then this man could not figure that out he was a paul bite he said that he could understand the atheists or the communists or the free thinker or somebody else doing that but when the church itself destroyed the word of god it was tantamount to the premeditated murder he said there is your hybrid religion wake up america for it's too late and i'm here tonight to say it's too late america he said when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything and when you get away from the word you'll believe anything is okay anything is all right because while you have left the absolute without the absolute you have nothing to hold yourself with that's right so going back to the ephesian church age again he talks about how what had happened there they had left their first love but he says i want you i want you to understand something that the sp must realize that the spirit is not speaking to just the original saints at ephesus alone this message is to the entire age it's a message to all generation in that span and it ke and his history keeps repeating itself in the generations of israel we see revel revival in one generation only the fires the fade what have we seen we've seen a revival taken place now it's up to you to keep that revival to keep adding another log to the fire to keep adding to it not not let it diminish in any way but keep saying god i want more of you i believe that ought to be every desire i don't care if you've been in and serving the lord for five minutes or 50 years 100 years whatever it is every day ought to say god i want more of you amen i've got to have more of you i i got to have more of you revealed unto me he said well you'd see it burn down and god would like to fire again and go on you start out with truly born again believers the next generation comes along they're no longer just plain christians they've taken on a name baptist methodists they're not christians so you have to be born of the will of god not the will of man but you said these folks are all coming together now by the will of man he said well what happens the original fire had died down the fervent desire to please god was gone the passion to know his word was gone the cry for the reaching out in the spirit god i want you to move i i need you to cry for reaching out in the spirit it all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god it's cooled off and become formal that's what happened back there in the ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to god was dying out and people were beginning to be too careful about what the world thought of them instead of what god thought about them and it's very easy when you see people that's worried about what the world thinks about them sisters start painting their face start cutting their hair men start wearing these all kind of fads and fashion why because you're worried about what the world thinks about you not about what god you're you don't paint your face to go meet god you do it to meet men but we get to where we care less about what god cares about us and more what the world cares about us and it shows in our attitude and so you know you think well my kids my kids are doing these things what where did it come from you know i was challenging a church one time i said you know you want your children to have spiritual worship and to worship god and to live for god i said that all starts with you parents and your attitude towards christ will have an everlasting effect upon your children but when mamas are going around what daddy says and destroying the structures of home amen you can't expect anything different the bars have come down and satan is coming into your home when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to god it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they change their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior they get lacks which that's what ephesus means relax drifting we're going back to our scripture here jacob have i loved esau have i hated why was this before these boys was even born god saw what was there on the inside of them amen the the the placing that was there and the seed that was there and jacob was born with this inherent desire i want the birthright i want everything god has for me i don't care what i gotta lose i don't care what i gotta do i don't care what what if i gotta die i can care less i want what god has for me but he saw the formal church amen the carnal believer he was willing to sell it out for peanuts a bowl of soup now mom my wife she loves soup me it's not my favorite thing to eat dead of winter maybe i like it every once in a while but it sure wouldn't be something i'd trade for maybe a steak you know if i see salt soup are you kidding me but it shows you how how trivial people will give right take in exchange for eternal life what are you getting well brother timothy i got a i got a drawer full of makeup and i i got these clothes and i got my hair cut like i wanted and i got my pants like i wanted i got my hairstyle like soup oh come on now nothing but soup nothing but porridge that's going to fall into the ground and be gone and decayed one day we're talking about eternal life and the spiritual church will say god i want all you got i don't care if it cleans my closet out i don't care if it cleans my car out i don't care if it cleans my life out i want all you got he longed for the birthright no matter what he had to do to get it just so he got it he didn't care how he had to get it that birthright is what he wanted no matter how he got it just so so he got it if you had to get down the altar scream and cry and boohoo and snot if that's what it took i want it amen listen to this right here he said some of them say brother branham them people down there boohooing at the altar and crying and crying i don't want it that way well you won't get it he said there was a colored brother down in the south one time was always happy his boss said what makes you so happy at the time boy all the time boy he said i got that heartfelt religion boss he said yeah there's no such a thing he said you made one mistake as far as you know there's no such a thing [Laughter] hallelujah the holy ghost don't fall no more like that brother timothy made a mistake as far as you know the holy ghost don't fall at that anymore amen people don't get drunk like that no more brother timothy as far as you know they don't get drunk like that no more but as far as i know and what i've witnessed gone still the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah as far as you know he don't steal heal and he don't still say and he don't steal forever but as far as i know he still does as far as you know he don't show himself visible but as far as i know he still does hallelujah he knew different because he had the experience you know i mean people are very quick to pass judgment on something some girls get drunk and they get what we call out of water and they pass judgment on that well my you know my generation was taught better maybe your generation needs to be taught how to receive the holy ghost how to be subject to a husband how to be subject to a pastor get those things right then talk about your generation i'm saying that very specifically but as far as you know god don't act that way i say let's wait and see what the fruits are because it is the spirit of god is going to bear the spirit of god for the fruits of god he said one day he said i want to get some of that heartfelt religion he said well when do you want it he said right now he said well let's go get it it ain't got to be a specific service it ain't going to be a specific time that's the devil telling you that you want it let's go get it you want deliverance let's get it tonight you want the holy ghost let's get it tonight you want healing let's get it tonight you want deliverance from that spirit let's get it tonight we're still in the delivering business we put limitations on god our community puts limitations on god but with a god that i serve has no limits he has no power no limit to his power he has no limit to his healing he has no limit to his love glory to god he is god and he changes not no matter what man may say [Music] hallelujah so they walked out to the outside and he said hey there's a hail off right there it's real nice and comfortable so the wife won't hear me or anything he said that's the way people want it they want to you know hand them on a platter where they can be comfortable god wants you to get out of your comfort zone that's what laodicea is all about be comfortable lukewarm you know be comfortable we don't want it too hot we don't want it too cold be comfortable that brother said old brother said you don't get it there no you won't get it there he said well went down to a stall i said what about here there's a nice horse to haul some great horses here will we get it there nope we'll get it over in a corn crib nope where'd he get it he said follow me said he went out to the barnyard pulled up his pant legs and walked out in the pigpen so he got up to the knees and the knees in the mud and the slop said come on out here that's where you get it he said i don't want to come out there he said then you don't want it yet boss you don't want it yet but when you get ready it'll be here for you hallelujah all god needs is a willing vessel they say god no matter how it comes and how he may be chills it may be crying it may be snot it may be dancing it may be just sitting there and i can't say a word i don't know how to be but no matter how it is i want it i whatever i got to go through i want it no matter where i got to go i want it i want christ in my life more than anything in this world wasn't the point that he had to be in a pig pen to receive it he had to be willing to do anything to get it getting past his formalities and his comfort zones and what he thought the way the spirit of god ought to operate and say god well however it is i just want to be willing but he talks about the spirit of that birth of those two boys that are still represented in the world today coming to a head the spiritual believer and the carnal believer no one could say there wasn't both religious they were they didn't say they didn't say that one served an idol and they once served god they both served god but he said not everyone that saith lord lord will enter in you know he'll come they'll come to him said lord did we not do miracles in your name did did we not do these mighty works and he'll say depart from me for i never knew you what he knows everything that happens he knows every flea that batsons die he knows every hair on our head or they used to be on our head he knows everything he knows every tick he knows ever the most minor detail he never knew no you never allowed me to be your lord relationship i never knew you well he knows i come to church sure he does but has he known you yet has there been a real relationship a life change some of your fathers today maybe said i want this revival in my home let it start with you mamas let us start with you let god know you see he said if jacob had one thing that he wanted because according the word the blessings and the good things laid in the birthright jacob that was his only objective the only thing he had in mind i've got to have that birthright and esau was ashamed of it he despised it but jacob wanted it regardless of how he got it he wanted it that's the way the super spiritual believer is today he doesn't care how much you laugh at him how much fun you make how ridiculous he has to act to the carnal mind his only objective is the birthright he wants to get to god because he's born in him to get to him hallelujah i can't help but do what i do because it's born in me to get to him there's a seed on the inside of me that said i've got to get in that presence jacob means to planter and deceiver but he comes into the position possession of the birthright which led him into the presence of the angel and he was changed carnal change then it was called not longer jacob but israel a prince with the lord who's wrestled with him the carnal believer you know as long as i go to church as long as i you know do my duties what difference does it make he said that's the esau group he still makes fun he still despises the birthright he doesn't care for it but jacob loved it the spiritual man today and the spiritual woman today that's elected predestinated of god to come to eternal life if they have to sell everything they got if they have to take their name off for every church book in the nation they still want that birthright it's the only thing that matters to them get that birth right no matter how what level they have to come to if they have to get down the altar cry boohoo if they have to run it through the place go back and make things right sell what they got give everything away become a pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter they want the birthright that's all that's interested in the birthright he said don't blame them they can't help it they were predestinated to that elected to that hallelujah i thank god for his election i think about it every day he could have put me on any continent he could have put me in any family but he put me in a family that believes the word of god be raised in a spiritual home in a spiritual atmosphere amen of seed of god place on the inside of me not by my natural birth [Applause] by election listen young people it wasn't by chance you was put in this church it wasn't by chance you was putting the family you was put in you say well my father's really not my father that's not by chance god orchestrated that god placing people can make fun they can do whatever they want to god did that amen and if god did it there ain't nothing the devil can do about it listening and watching the chosen i thought it was very interesting how the philip would tell matthew as he was dealing with all of his complexes in his ways weird ways and strange ways i don't know if matthew was really like that but i know there are people that's really like that he's trying to figure it all out and why would god choose me and philip was telling me don't matter why it matters that he did the devil wants you to get hung up on why why did this happen why is it why am i like that what matters is god predestinated me and he elected me and he called me for this place and for this purpose that's all that matters it doesn't matter why i'm like this why why that's the devil trying to get you into that what matters is god said you're mine god said you're my daughter you're my son you're my child that's all that matters [Applause] but we see it as we talked about all the way back to the garden of eden one of wisdom and one of life one of carnal one of spiritual cain and abel both of them religious one of them desired life eternal and he offered to god by faith a more excellent sacrifice he said it's the perfect type of the church today the church spiritual and the church natural cain and abel he said there's no doubt but what i'm talking to both classes right now perhaps by tape we'll talk to tens of thousands of them but look the church natural just the church is just a church carnal they'll never be able to get above that little thing i'd go to church i'd join church i'm doing the best i can that's all god requires that's the same thing cain did he went and done the best he could he said god take it or leave it i don't i don't i don't want to have cane religion lord i go to church i've met the best one i can find i pay my dues i do what's right here's the best i can do i help pay some widows bills i i give children clothing them's all right nothing against that he says but that's all that's it that's all if you want it take it if you don't you don't have to take it he said that's the attitude of the church carnal today but the church spiritual able by revelation by grace he seemed beyond that and by faith he offered god a more excellent sacrifice than cain and it testified of his righteousness the same place took place in ishmael and isaac ones of the flesh one was of the spirit one was of the bond's woman one was of the free woman it happened the same thing with israel and moab two great churches coming together israel was wanting to go to the promised land church spiritual jacob's people israel on the road esau's people met the moab a powerful church great leader of the church balaam came down to curse them but he found he could not curse them he failed with the blindness of his eyes to see the predestinated plan of god and to see the pillar of fire that was among them here israel comes up to the promised land headed to it believers believers and here's moab not infidels believers actual believers in the same god that israel had come out to try to curse but they couldn't do it great nation here that israel was just trying to get to the promised land balaam bill's altars we heard about it here in our meetings baylor balaam offered seven sacrifices of clean bleach israel offered seven sacrifice they were as far as they could take it ritually moab was just as religious as israel was esau just as religious as jacob was cain just as religious as abel was but it was the election that's what holds he said how blind of esau's children spiritually speaking the moabites looking down upon israel look at them they're they're just a they're they're not a denomination they're a bunch of renegades they live in tents we're a great nation they've done evil they have no organization they just wigging around following the prophet but they failed to see the brass serpent they failed to see the smitten rock going before them they failed to see that called out elected group following the divine order of god to the promised land that's the way it is today they say it's a bunch of holy rollers they say it's a bunch of fanatics they say it's just a bunch of pentecostals they say that it's just all of this it's nothing of god but they fail to see the pillar of fire world they fail to see the angel of the lord stepping out and speaking he said jacob he said the reason he chose to find that birthright and he wanted to get it because he knew that that birthright held all the blessings the holy ghost entitles you to everything healings deliverances joy unspeakable and full of glory amen all the things it held life he didn't care how it come just so he got it that was the main thing let me go on down here it's a wonderful sermon now you can go and listen to it been listening to it here and receiving and acting but i just want to we're going to get into a couple things for you just bring it down but there's a true anointing true anointed and a false anointing and it's followed that once again carnal spiritual uh you know human abilities god abilities it's the twins of every revival and and brother brother brandon would preach a wonderful sermon that would bring a lot of clarity to this because it would br there's a lot of questions that can arise in mind because you know people can get anointed with the holy ghost but yet not have the holy ghost and do things and work signs and miracles and all those things that can take place he said see it's not false jesus is this false christ they believe they're anointed but they know they're not jesus yes too plain if a man went up and said look at my scars look at my brow i'm jesus well that you know that'd be wrong but jesus said to them gods would appear he said they would appear false christ or false anointed once he said remember i've always told you there's three classes of people three races of people ham sham and javid three races three classes make believer believer and unbeliever it's always been and always will be there was moses the believer there were jane janus and james the unbelievers and there was balaam the make believer remember the unbeliever the denominational church they don't believe in any signs at all the cold formal starchy church in the world the denomination but the make-believer is that shuck he might believe in signs my belief in some things but it puts a hold on god he said notice and this is was striking to me as i read this because i've actually witnessed this in these last few meetings i've been in he said notice how bold these unbelievers and these make-believers are they're bold he said look even as satan he said he stood right up in the presence of the true word and said it is written it is written why does satan do that because he knew he didn't know the word for that he knew the word he knew the word was for that hour but he doubted this humble man being that word he said if thou be i the son of god i know the son of god is coming if thou be he'll give you angel's charge see he said see do a miracle let me see you do it see he said see the unbeliever make believer amen the believer look at judas right among them same time make believer but he said how bold they are they'll say now don't pay no attention to that nonsense it's just a bunch of noise this is where the prophet of god is putting these statements at just a bunch of noise there's nothing to it it's all in your mind see what i mean stand right in the presence of the word and say it i'm not too sure some have not stayed set right in the presence of god and looked at the movement of the holy ghost and blasphemed and caught in an evil spirit the prophet of god had more wisdom than that you know he would he would see something to break out and this woman began to break out in the dance and he would look at it and he can get very critical in his heart and he'd criticize it he'd make the thoughts that come through his mind they're turning my church into a tavern bar room because apparently it wasn't very much an order apparently it was way out of water he said but i wouldn't say anything he said because they might be right and i might be wrong and then before the whole you know the story ends he's up there up there dancing along just right out in the wild dancing but people are very bold to get in the presence of god and call it an evil spirit i would wait till i sing the fruits of it i can tell you this i've seen this evil spirits and they're pretty easy to identify and they begin to speak out and they begin to do things that's uncommon and you realize that's an evil spirit it's easy to identify but sometimes god will act in ways and do things and anoint and move and it's god and people are very bold to say some things against it not realizing their voice in their own complexes and they're voicing their own humanities and if they're careful they blast faith he said see in the god of this evil age he would talk again about the the church the age of the seat he said all the way from the garden of eden all the way down there's never been an age now so deceptive now is this age false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders if possible to deceive the very elect if possible he said now just a cold formal starchy churches and so forth a made man-made theology that wouldn't elect would not ever pay attention to that notice that but it's up there almost like the real thing just leaving out one word is all you have to do the promise of the aids very great time christians everywhere take heed to the hour that we're living in he said what would god call a people out of this evil age for he wants a bride when she's made manifest been tried been proved amen to satan that she gonna stand no matter what goes on no matter what happens she's going to stand he said see the seed that fell on the ground it comes through the carriers all the way down to the church ages the same way the seed or the seed fell on the ground and eden same way that ends up in the last days he said just the gospel when it was fell on the denomination that nazi and rome it ends up in a super organization he's just just the same the seat of the church fell back there in the first age down into the ground it went with signs and wonders and living christ among them it'll end up in the last days under the ministry of malachi 4 restored back again to the original faith that was once given in the first age same signs same wonders same god same manifestations same power same healing same deliverances same everything god's not coming from a for a cold church he's not coming for a formal church this church the church god is coming for has the fire of god in her because it's written there in the in in the church ages there in the revelations he that walks in the candle sticks we know the candle sticks seven licks going down into one base the original fire lit that amen and they would go from one age all the way to the next stage the same original fire the same original holy ghost same god working same sign same wonders so he's coming back for a church with the fire of god in it the light of god moving in it the signs and wonders being made manifest the spirit the manifestations of the spirit at work did you hear me it ain't an evil spirit it's a manifestation of the holy spirit at work and it does not matter how many ministers say it don't work no more you know that which is perfect has come so that which is part is done away with do you understand what that means we've been taught very well we have the perfect so we have all that's in the perfect so we don't just have part no more we have all of it we have something that's worth being in a revival about listen we see a bunch of world that's being they're being lifted up into a revival amen they're out in the streets they're knocking down doors they're in a revival of evil and a revival of sin don't you know there ought to be a church of the real church the church of the living god also in a revival also in a lifting up we're not going down into the ground church we're going up and he's not coming back for a formal church or a formal person he's coming back for fire miss barrios he said when a man or woman is set under creeds in cold form of religion if he's ordained to be a son of god and he sees the word of god preaching his power and god vindicates it he's an eagle to begin with he'll run to it as sure as two plus two is four he can't help it because his very nature loves the word of god and he's not going to sit under some dead creed and some dead dogma but he's going to move to the light he hears the eagle scream he said the book of he said the true christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army and satan will be powerless before her hallelujah i wonder how many today would say lord i want all of you i want all of you i want to just continue to add more logs to the fire lord build it up brighter brighter than ever lord in my life yes lord father lord
