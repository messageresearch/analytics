[31:09] goodness to us asking for your grace
[31:12] today Lord did you grace us with your
[31:15] presence
[31:16] and so some would say come by here or
[31:20] come by here I pray Lord you'll come by
[31:23] ever hard in life you minister to ever
[31:27] soul according to the need that is there
[31:29] I ask in Jesus name as we worship you
[31:33] today and thank you where your goodness
[31:36] amen amen god bless you you can have
[31:39] your seats good to be in the house of
[31:42] the Lord today and have this privilege
[31:44] of worshiping him so we want to welcome
[31:47] everyone that is here and man good to
[31:49] see you Darlene there nice to have you
[31:52] in service with us and
[31:54] each one that has come Matt and Kimber
[31:57] all the way from down south
[32:01] Texas they're nice to have you in our
[32:03] service and the Blake family again so if
[32:07] you're here today don't feel like a
[32:09] visitor we want you to feel like family
[32:12] amen we appreciate you being here today
[32:14] and and each one that has assembled amen
[32:18] um you know of course next Sunday is
[32:21] going to be our last Sunday before camp
[32:24] and
[32:25] after that there will not be a Wednesday
[32:28] night service so there will be one this
[32:30] week but not after next Sunday service
[32:34] will be taking the equipment and things
[32:37] down to youth camp and we have a very
[32:41] full camp and many many come from coming
[32:45] outside and and just great needs that
[32:50] people have and we would appreciate you
[32:53] holding that up in prayer is it's part
[32:55] of our ministry to the Bride of Christ
[32:58] to have the young people to come from
[33:00] every Church everywhere wherever they
[33:03] come from and
[33:05] for us to be able to minister to them
[33:08] during that time is a great honor and a
[33:11] privilege
[33:12] amen to serve the body of Christ so I
[33:15] want you to remember that and you know
[33:18] also I wanted to make mention that
[33:20] yesterday was a great milestone as you
[33:23] know was brother branham's birthday he
[33:26] would have been a hundred and ten years
[33:29] old you know but he's so fulfilled
[33:33] Malachi four five and six right down to
[33:36] the letter as he was born on the the
[33:40] fourth month at the fifth hour on the
[33:43] sixth day so you know Malachi four five
[33:46] and six so we we appreciate God sending
[33:49] a prophet in our generation to turn our
[33:52] hearts back to faith again where would
[33:54] we be today we'd still be floundered
[33:57] around out in some system a man
[34:00] somewhere but God rich in mercy amen
[34:04] actually did something very very special
[34:07] in our generation to send a message to
[34:09] us and you know we ought to feel a very
[34:13] special people today because it says to
[34:17] and to the Angel of the Church of
[34:20] Laodicea right that God had a messenger
[34:24] to this last age and you were afforded
[34:27] the opportunity to be acquainted with
[34:29] that message and hear it that's great
[34:32] grace upon your lives and we must never
[34:35] turn that down but accept that also I
[34:38] want to make mention that we have been
[34:41] blessed by some offerings that have come
[34:43] from the outside for the Japanese
[34:45] missions so those things are pretty well
[34:47] taken care of for now as we continue on
[34:51] translation of the sealed book and the
[34:55] church age book and many different
[34:58] various ones in fact we're just sending
[35:00] them a list of sermons that that I have
[35:04] laid out for them to
[35:06] to get translated in Japanese now what
[35:09] happens with that is they get translated
[35:12] in from English into Japanese for
[35:15] Japanese speaking people they're
[35:16] uploaded on the hub and the message hub
[35:20] which is sponsored by brother Bissell's
[35:23] church but it affords were that anybody
[35:26] everywhere where whatever language that
[35:29] you speak if we have a sermon in that
[35:31] language you can access it from the web
[35:34] and this is very very important to
[35:37] places like
[35:39] communist areas where the message has
[35:42] now been not just message but since
[35:45] Christianity has been sequestered and
[35:47] and stopped there's a lot of persecution
[35:51] that is going on in a lot of those
[35:54] communist countries even today as we
[35:56] speak
[35:58] countries like China that are really
[36:01] clamping down on the underground
[36:03] churches and making it where that they
[36:06] can't gather and actually they're
[36:08] rewarding people for turning in someone
[36:12] who is meeting for religious cause and
[36:15] worshipping God so you don't know the
[36:17] privilege that you have this morning of
[36:20] being able to meet together like you're
[36:23] meeting together with freedom and
[36:25] worshipping the Lord together and this
[36:29] is afforded to you and I think of how
[36:31] many you know just disregard that
[36:34] opportunity and you know don't don't
[36:37] take advantage of coming together and
[36:40] meeting together like we have the
[36:43] privilege of doing I thought um I
[36:45] thought it was so on Wednesday and I we
[36:48] got you know some some feedback from the
[36:52] Japanese believers that were so blessed
[36:55] by the ministry wins tonight and you
[36:58] know it's their morning over there and
[37:00] so they're able to on a Thursday morning
[37:03] gather together for their going to work
[37:06] and listen to the two even in light
[37:09] tabernacle in the service and stream it
[37:11] and be blessed and and and to realize
[37:15] you made a contribution to their
[37:18] blessing
[37:19] by you know singing worship and praising
[37:21] God creating an atmosphere that can even
[37:25] affect those in overseas lands and we
[37:28] must never forget the responsibility
[37:31] that we have to be bearers of this
[37:34] message that God gave us amen and
[37:37] speaking of that you know we we as I
[37:41] said you know those those mission needs
[37:43] right now are we have enough to keep us
[37:48] ahead right now on the Japanese
[37:50] translations and and God's provided also
[37:54] the way for the brothers to go again and
[37:56] and not only to Japan but to the men had
[38:02] on his heart the Philippines this time
[38:05] and so he also helped sponsor by the
[38:07] Timothy's trip into the Philippines
[38:10] where they he'll meet ministered at a
[38:12] youth camp he just you know he just had
[38:15] it on his heart as we were going we have
[38:18] never been none of us have ever been to
[38:20] the Philippines and so you know right in
[38:22] the moment what we had in our heart but
[38:25] the Timothy and agreed to go to preach
[38:27] that youth camp or the Tim Leonard's
[38:29] going with him and going over into the
[38:32] Philippines there's a be about 900 young
[38:35] people brother John Andes have
[38:37] ministered there and in the Philippines
[38:40] at that youth camp are believing and so
[38:43] anyway with with them with all adapted
[38:47] on our hearts and we'd already made the
[38:50] commitment to go and you understand when
[38:54] you go into a place like that it's a
[38:56] third world country so you're
[38:58] responsible for all of your expenses
[39:00] going they haven't they have bear little
[39:03] or nothing to give back and so it's all
[39:06] you know you you have to give in order
[39:09] to to go and to share and they request
[39:12] that you come and and set up the
[39:14] meetings and so on but then you have to
[39:16] sponsor yourself so in this moment you
[39:19] know in this very moment that the need
[39:21] is there God provides that that the
[39:25] gentleman that has never been our church
[39:28] never been to serve never darkened our
[39:31] doors as far as I know never listened to
[39:33] his service from this church but he
[39:35] sponsored everything we've done in Japan
[39:37] and God had moved on his heart also to
[39:40] do something for the Philippines at the
[39:41] same time amen so you know God works on
[39:44] both ends and the on both ends because
[39:47] God is God and he's interested in this
[39:50] and he cares so we ought to care amen so
[39:55] we've got to put our heart into it and I
[39:57] want to thank brother brother Daniel
[40:01] again for coming to this weekend and
[40:03] being with us in this special time if it
[40:07] wasn't raining I'd love to take you all
[40:09] back out and see the the big units that
[40:12] we've got set up on the activities
[40:14] building things that we have a vision
[40:16] that would go beyond and you know I just
[40:19] wanted to say you know what we have out
[40:21] there has already been paid for in and
[40:24] provided that God put enough into my
[40:28] hands that I was not only able to build
[40:31] this building debt-free but also to
[40:35] build this other building debt-free and
[40:37] as I told you you know there's things
[40:39] that need
[40:40] completing and and when you think and
[40:42] you pray about home missions remember
[40:44] you know I our home missions as well and
[40:49] the offerings here at the church you
[40:50] know to continue on the work of God I
[40:53] know that I know that you can't outgive
[40:56] God you say brother Tim you you are
[41:00] actually
[41:02] you know asking for money no I'm just
[41:05] passing the plate I'm just telling you
[41:08] that there is a need there and and
[41:10] you're responsible for that need amen
[41:14] God puts it in your hands and you put it
[41:16] in God's hands amen he gives you give
[41:20] back and then he says I'll give it back
[41:22] pressed down overflowing and abundantly
[41:25] and this is the way God works amen so
[41:28] I'm just asking you to to be considered
[41:32] of that and just realize there are
[41:35] others that are giving our brother
[41:37] Daniel comes all the way from North
[41:39] Carolina to to give on his
[41:43] a long weekend too to help us in in
[41:46] getting this done and also we had
[41:49] brother Jeremy a Shriner that came over
[41:53] and helped us with the plumbing last
[41:55] week you know these men are giving of
[41:58] their time and their expense and
[42:01] everything else to come and and be a
[42:03] part of this amen so you know there is
[42:07] there is many that have to be invested
[42:11] yes the Bible said God gave the word but
[42:13] great was the number of those that
[42:16] published it so you know God gives it
[42:19] and great is the number that publishes
[42:22] that helps it and puts it out and I
[42:24] believe that God wants us to - as long
[42:27] as we're here and we're long as we're
[42:29] abiding in this place at this time you
[42:32] know to abide until he comes and put
[42:35] every effort we can and do
[42:38] - to the gospel of Christ we could you
[42:42] know he he gives us a responsibility
[42:45] when he gives us a message you know when
[42:49] I'm done too much who much is given
[42:52] there is much required so therefore we
[42:56] want to give back unto the Lord and you
[42:58] know when I'm speaking about giving back
[43:00] and doing we have with us today a
[43:03] wonderful wonderful couple that is with
[43:07] us that's really special dear to our
[43:09] hearts brother John and ease his wife
[43:10] sister Sharon that have come and they
[43:13] they've come and took part of their
[43:16] vacation this is this is real I mean
[43:20] took their vacation and spending it on
[43:23] you to come here and to share things on
[43:26] their heart and and
[43:28] minister to you and encourage you in the
[43:31] the ways of righteousness and you know
[43:34] this could have been spent down in
[43:36] Mexico or holiday place or Bahamas or
[43:40] wherever they wanted to go but they
[43:42] chose to come here and to be here with
[43:45] us this weekend to bless us and I say
[43:48] you know that's really the heart of the
[43:51] Bride of Christ amen we're not selfies
[43:54] we're not thinking about our own South
[43:55] but we realize that we've been called in
[43:58] this age for a purpose and to give what
[44:01] we have unto God and to lend ourselves
[44:04] to him and yield ourselves to him and
[44:06] and you know it's Laodicea though where
[44:09] it's considered self-interest but I
[44:12] believe it's time that we look and say
[44:14] we're not them kind of Laodiceans we're
[44:17] kind of we're the kind of people that
[44:19] put everything into the gospel because
[44:22] we want to see this finished up I don't
[44:24] know how much longer we have but I want
[44:26] to give every bit of energy I have to
[44:29] the coming of the Lord and preparing the
[44:31] people for his coming amen so we're
[44:34] happy to have brother John and these his
[44:36] wife sister Sharon with us today I want
[44:39] us to stand together and we're just
[44:40] gonna welcome to the John to share the
[44:43] Word of God today as as he as he spends
[44:46] his vacation with us hey man you you
[44:50] know I don't want you to go on a holiday
[44:51] and lay back and go to sleep though I
[44:53] want you to just put your heart into it
[44:56] too and and say this is a special time
[44:58] that God has given us and I was to sing
[45:02] the song our God reigns have a lovely on
[45:05] the mountain or the feet of them that
[45:07] bring good news
[45:09] I believe brother John's a bringer of
[45:11] good news the gospel of Jesus Christ
[45:14] that he's a alive that he's not dead but
[45:18] he's risen a man that he's a living God
[45:22] and he's able to heal delivers set free
[45:25] whatever whatever the need is our
[45:29] thunderings I've got her
[45:33] amen
[45:34] hallelujah
[45:36] [Music]
[45:40] I'll just feel the holy spirit
[45:43] just drop that on back now I
[45:46] just want you to know God reigns over
[45:50] ever situation that there's nothing too
[45:54] hard for God
[45:56] but right here in this service today
[45:59] he's a god this mindful of your need and
[46:03] he reigns he reigns over the sickness in
[46:07] your body the problems in your family
[46:10] the situations in your home your
[46:12] marriage whatever the condition the
[46:15] situation's right here in this church
[46:17] whether you're on the internet or
[46:19] wherever you are around the world our
[46:21] God reigns and he's alive this worship
[46:26] got together as we welcomed him to speak
[46:28] to us through a gift
[46:32] Jesus can't be here today in the flesh
[46:36] of
[46:37] the nail-scarred body
[46:40] we will meet him in the air
[46:43] that dimension that he's prepared for us
[46:46] to meet him in we will meet him
[46:49] we already know what he looks like
[46:52] we had a prophet of God said he was a
[46:55] small man look like wooden way over I
[47:00] think 120 40 pounds
[47:04] yes said he had a look on his face
[47:08] [Music]
[47:12] that's so odd the prophet of God that he
[47:15] said he just passed out he looked its
[47:17] way
[47:17] [Music]
[47:18] wept is upon his pajamas tops and
[47:23] whatever until there was so good tears
[47:26] just a glimpse of it said the closest
[47:30] thing I could describe of him was
[47:32] Hoffman's head of Christ and this
[47:34] closest thing I ever saw
[47:36] but we kind of know what he looks like
[47:38] we got a little picture but Jesus is not
[47:42] going to come walk today and a
[47:44] nail-scarred body walk here
[47:48] shake her hands or lay his hands on us
[47:51] but the Bible said when he ascended on
[47:55] high he
[47:56] sent back gifts unto men and these gifts
[48:01] he went ministered through to the church
[48:03] and his voice would still be heard
[48:05] through these gifts these portions of
[48:08] Christ that he would place in men and he
[48:12] would use this for the perfecting of the
[48:16] maturing of the church and for the
[48:18] building up of the body of Christ the
[48:20] edifying building up of the body of
[48:22] Christ and he would do this until we all
[48:25] come to the unity of the faith to the
[48:28] knowledge of the Son of God
[48:29] and he'll come this morning
[48:32] his voice can still be heard
[48:35] he won't be using the voice of that man
[48:39] a small man maybe five six five nine
[48:44] tall not very tall just he medium built
[48:49] the Bible said no beauty that we should
[48:51] desire him
[48:53] let him be using a little vessel
[48:56] and he's ordained called to this
[48:59] generation and you today can hear the
[49:02] voice of God speak
[49:06] and if you treat it just like it was
[49:08] that Jesus was walking by and you call
[49:12] him to Europe you
[49:14] to your need this Jesus will not pass
[49:18] you by but he'll minister directly to
[49:20] your heart and he'll speak the same as
[49:22] if he was using that nail-scarred body
[49:24] and he'll speak exactly to your need
[49:27] today whether it's for salvation
[49:29] deliverance
[49:30] whatever it is he's here to minister to
[49:33] you
[49:34] how lovely on the mountains are the feet
[49:37] of them who bring good news
[49:39] announcing peace let's worship God
[49:43] lovely
[49:47] the my
[49:49] song

[56:31] old-fashioned revival sweep through this
[56:33] city Lord may and just may people come
[56:37] everywhere to Shawano here that they
[56:39] might know that Jesus lives and reigns
[56:42] granted Father in Jesus name we ask it
[56:45] amen would that be wonderful if the Lord
[56:48] would answer that today amen we want to
[56:51] speak this morning on repairing your
[56:53] personal altar
[56:54] repairing your personal altar and we can
[56:58] turn to the scripture first Kings
[57:01] chapter 18
[57:03] thank you sister Amy for working with us
[57:06] this morning back and forth first Kings
[57:08] chapter 18 verse 30 this is after the
[57:11] prophets the false prophets of Bale had
[57:14] gone through their exercises and things
[57:16] that finally Elijah and verse 30 said
[57:20] unto all the people come near unto me
[57:23] and all the people came near unto him
[57:26] and he repaired the altar of the Lord
[57:30] that was broken down I want to thank God
[57:33] for a prophet Elijah that's come in our
[57:36] generation and it took a prophet to
[57:40] repair the altar and me believe that not
[57:43] a just a preacher not just another
[57:46] Church doctrine was going to do it it
[57:47] took a prophet we have to believe that
[57:50] and I believe that's been completed the
[57:54] altar has been restored public altar but
[57:58] now we're talking about your altar your
[58:00] private altar that's what we're focusing
[58:03] on today and Elijah took 12 stones
[58:07] according to the number of the tribes of
[58:09] the sons of jacob unto whom the word of
[58:12] the lord came saying israel shall be thy
[58:15] name and with the stones he built an
[58:18] altar in the name of the lord and
[58:22] he made a trench about the altar as
[58:25] great as would contain two measures of
[58:27] seed and he put the wood in order this
[58:31] is like church order he put the wood in
[58:33] order cut the Bullock in pieces and laid
[58:36] him on the wood and said fill four
[58:39] barrels with water and pour it on the
[58:42] burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he
[58:44] said do it the second time and they did
[58:47] it the second time and he said do it the
[58:49] third time and they did it the third
[58:52] time
[58:53] this is kind of ridiculous wasn't it do
[58:57] you agree your but you want fire and
[59:00] you're pouring altar water on the altar
[59:04] one time two times three times you're
[59:08] just drenching everything to the carnal
[59:10] mind it's crazy they still think you're
[59:13] crazy but watch Elijah as he was
[59:15] preparing this altar and the water ran
[59:18] round about the altar and he filled the
[59:21] trench also with water and it came to
[59:24] pass at the time of the offering of the
[59:26] evening sacrifice
[59:27] that Elijah the Prophet came near and
[59:30] said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of
[59:32] Israel let it be knowing this day that
[59:36] thou art God in Israel and that I am thy
[59:39] servant and that I have done all these
[59:41] things at thy word hear me o Lord hear
[59:45] me that this people may know that thou
[59:48] art the Lord God and that thou has
[59:51] turned their heart back again
[59:54] then the fire of the Lord fell and
[59:58] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:00:02] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:00:07] licked up the water that was in the
[1:00:09] trench and when all the people saw it
[1:00:12] they fell on their faces and they said
[1:00:14] the Lord he is the God the Lord he is
[1:00:19] the God how great is our God I pray God
[1:00:23] consume the altar today
[1:00:26] consume us as believers god bless you
[1:00:29] can have your seats thank you
[1:00:33] so nice to be with you this morning
[1:00:36] nice to be able to see you face to face

[1:03:14] youth camp
[1:03:16] amen an eternal holiday
[1:03:21] as last Sunday one of the brothers I
[1:03:23] think Kelly Hildebrandt was going to the
[1:03:25] hospital and had a high blood pressure
[1:03:28] troubles and there was another brother
[1:03:30] in our church that has cancer and he's
[1:03:33] in his 70s and I was sharing with them
[1:03:34] both this week about how that I felt
[1:03:37] like brother Tim it was maybe the new
[1:03:39] body just colliding with their natural
[1:03:42] body the change is on and we have these
[1:03:46] groanings and we have these things that
[1:03:48] we're going through as believers but
[1:03:50] it's a reality that change is right
[1:03:53] around the corner and we just pray as it
[1:03:57] says in Psalms that we would be able to
[1:03:59] live this life of this word so that our
[1:04:02] children and our grandchildren now would
[1:04:06] be able to want what we've got and this
[1:04:09] is a burden of our hearts as we came
[1:04:11] this weekend and one word stood out in
[1:04:13] my heart and that was the word personal
[1:04:15] and we spoke on it in Cloverdale on
[1:04:18] Wednesday night but I want to bring it
[1:04:20] this morning and speak on repairing your
[1:04:23] personal altar and as we go back to
[1:04:27] first Kings chapter 18
[1:04:29] together and look at this are we ready
[1:04:33] for the word now
[1:04:34] Elijah was called to repair the altar
[1:04:38] and it took a prophet of God in our day
[1:04:42] to build an altar that's gone global I
[1:04:46] just want to remind you today that
[1:04:48] you're not just a little Church in and
[1:04:50] the road in the hills of Louisiana your
[1:04:54] testimony has gone global I
[1:04:57] want to remind you that you're part of
[1:05:00] this altar it's not just a private altar
[1:05:03] it's a public altar but I was thinking
[1:05:06] as the Holy Spirit was coming into the
[1:05:08] room this morning to prepare us for the
[1:05:10] word is even as brother Tim said the
[1:05:12] presence of God come it's more than just
[1:05:14] a public altar now it's a private altar
[1:05:18] and for many many years I was thinking
[1:05:20] this morning is one that's been raised
[1:05:22] in the message and have gone now through
[1:05:24] many cycles and years now that our
[1:05:26] children and our one's and those that
[1:05:28] are coming to the Lord they deserve an
[1:05:31] atmosphere that it's charged with the
[1:05:34] presence of the Holy Spirit and I pray
[1:05:36] that all of us God would not crown our
[1:05:39] lives to be just some old kravid
[1:05:41] individuals or a church that is because
[1:05:44] we've heard this for years it becomes
[1:05:46] common
[1:05:47] they deserve to have it fresh again and
[1:05:51] but let's bring it down personal today
[1:05:54] let's repair our personal altars because
[1:05:56] we could talk global we could talk about
[1:05:59] a church altar we could talk about a
[1:06:02] family altar we could talk about a
[1:06:04] marriage altar but I want to speak to
[1:06:06] you personally about your personal altar
[1:06:09] now in first Kings chapter 18 verse 30
[1:06:13] Elisha repaired the altar of the Lord
[1:06:16] that was broken down but it was a public
[1:06:19] altar many around was seeing this great
[1:06:23] demonstration and it seemed kind of
[1:06:25] crazy about pouring water on the under
[1:06:27] sacrifice and on the wood and on the
[1:06:30] stones but the fire of God came down and
[1:06:34] vindicated this is God
[1:06:36] that's happened globally in the message
[1:06:39] but if we're not careful we can get
[1:06:42] caught up in that and miss out the
[1:06:44] personal altar so what we see in first
[1:06:47] Kings 18 and verse 32 was him taking
[1:06:51] stones to build an altar in the name of
[1:06:53] the Lord and he made a trench around the
[1:06:56] altar this was a public altar we have
[1:06:58] testimonies our testimonies public our
[1:07:01] service and our calling in life is to
[1:07:05] the public but now let's turn to the
[1:07:07] next chapter first Kings chapter 18
[1:07:09] verse sorry verse 19 God
[1:07:13] brought elides it to a private altar and
[1:07:16] we see in first Kings 19 and many of you
[1:07:21] are familiar this with this in verse 9
[1:07:24] how God brought Elisha to a cave and he
[1:07:26] began to Lodge there and behold the word
[1:07:29] of the Lord came to him and said unto
[1:07:31] Him what doest thou here Elijah and he
[1:07:35] said I've been very jealous for the Lord
[1:07:37] God of hosts for the children of Israel
[1:07:40] have forsaken
[1:07:41] by covenant and throwing down thine
[1:07:43] altars and slain thy prophets with the
[1:07:46] sword and I even I only am left and they
[1:07:50] seek my life to take it away see he had
[1:07:53] a public altar of God coming and
[1:07:55] consuming him but he still had an
[1:07:57] attitude and I thought that he was the
[1:07:59] only one going through the trial I'm the
[1:08:02] only one I'm the only marriage that has
[1:08:04] troubles I'm the only family that has
[1:08:07] troubles I'm the only church in the
[1:08:09] message or why is these things going on
[1:08:11] but God was bringing him to an awareness
[1:08:14] that there's 7000 if you look in verse
[1:08:17] 18 God was letting his prophet know
[1:08:20] after a personal encounter that there
[1:08:23] was 7000 in Israel that had not bowed
[1:08:26] their knees or bowed unto Bale and every
[1:08:30] mouth which had not kissed him so even
[1:08:33] after the public altar God deals
[1:08:36] privately can God do that this morning
[1:08:39] now it's this afternoon can God do that
[1:08:42] for you that might be approaching thanks
[1:08:46] to a public way and a publican you got
[1:08:48] to be worried about how you're dressed
[1:08:50] and how's my hand lifted up and if I do
[1:08:52] that my shirt is gonna come up and what
[1:08:54] are we so interested in how we look that
[1:08:57] we can't bend down and pick up the
[1:08:59] stones today say God repair that my own
[1:09:03] personal alter
[1:09:05] take something from the Word of God that
[1:09:07] will help us in our daily life and if
[1:09:11] you look here in verse 11
[1:09:14] elijah goes out and stands before the
[1:09:16] mount before the Lord and the Lord
[1:09:18] passed by with a great wind and it rent
[1:09:21] the mountains and then you see later in
[1:09:24] the verse the wind after the wind an
[1:09:27] earthquake but the Lord was not in the
[1:09:29] earthquake
[1:09:30] verse 12 after the earthquake a fire but
[1:09:33] the Lord was not in the fire and after
[1:09:36] the fire a still small voice he's in a
[1:09:40] cave he's in a private place the song
[1:09:44] leader isn't around
[1:09:46] it's not your spouse around or the
[1:09:48] counselor it's not the preacher it's a
[1:09:52] personal encounter
[1:09:54] God was bringing him from the public
[1:09:56] show we would say and the fire coming
[1:09:58] and all of the dynamics - now it's
[1:10:01] personal
[1:10:02] this is where we're going right now to
[1:10:04] where the still small voice can mean
[1:10:06] something to him and I trust today that
[1:10:09] would happen for somebody
[1:10:11] Lord turned from just being a public
[1:10:13] saying to its private shake us Lord from
[1:10:17] just Doctrine and code and church order
[1:10:20] to where it's personal and that's what
[1:10:24] happened in verse 12 and verse 13 that
[1:10:27] is when Elijah heard it and rapped his
[1:10:29] face in his mantle and went out and God
[1:10:31] began to speak to him and verse 14 he is
[1:10:35] actually the very verse of verse 10 and
[1:10:38] 14 are just repeated word-for-word that
[1:10:42] he thought Elijah thought he was so
[1:10:44] jealous for the Lord and things and he
[1:10:46] had saw the people in the message are
[1:10:48] the children of Israel casting down
[1:10:51] their altars and slain the prophets and
[1:10:53] he thought oh I'm the only one I'm the
[1:10:56] only one and now they want to take my
[1:10:59] life but it wasn't that way there were
[1:11:02] more believers that were serving God
[1:11:05] that were wanting this also God just had
[1:11:08] to open his eyes and now you're old
[1:11:11] enough now as the mature bride as we
[1:11:14] heard this morning our prophet would
[1:11:16] have been older but God took him off the
[1:11:19] scene and 65 he God needed a bride that
[1:11:23] would want a personal encounter with him
[1:11:26] and I wonder today if we could just make
[1:11:28] it a prayer God give us a personal altar
[1:11:33] today's be personal to me can we say
[1:11:37] that together and
[1:11:39] be personal someone else that is needy
[1:11:42] of a personal touch
[1:11:46] hallelujah Jesus let's speak about this
[1:11:49] word altar can I do that just a little
[1:11:51] bit I need to relax a little bit when we
[1:11:54] talk about an altar in the Old Testament
[1:11:56] it was a place of worship
[1:11:59] it was a place where there was maybe
[1:12:02] called tables and saints they had
[1:12:04] benches and slabs they actually called
[1:12:08] it a platformer that they put up it was
[1:12:10] called an altar and an altar was where
[1:12:13] they slaughtered and they killed and
[1:12:15] they sacrificed it was like divine
[1:12:17] judgment it was actually they took they
[1:12:20] were showing
[1:12:21] pre-pre that Christ was going to come
[1:12:24] and die in a cross on an altar but as we
[1:12:28] move into the New Testament after all of
[1:12:31] these lanes and burnings and Christ
[1:12:33] coming on an altar when you and I
[1:12:36] receive this Christ on the altar then
[1:12:39] the fruits of his death can come out of
[1:12:41] our lives that's the altar I'm speaking
[1:12:44] of today so this morning I'd like to
[1:12:47] take these three parts of the service on
[1:12:49] repairing and then your personal and
[1:12:53] then your altar what is an altar would
[1:12:56] that be okay and I want to speak about
[1:12:59] repairing because repairing means it's
[1:13:02] something that you used to have before
[1:13:04] to repair means you used to have
[1:13:09] something but it's broken down
[1:13:11] there there's a renewal that God is
[1:13:14] declaring and God is repairing and
[1:13:17] asking you to pick up some rocks and
[1:13:20] pick up your own altar as an individual
[1:13:24] hallelujah God's given you a fresh
[1:13:27] beginning or an experience something
[1:13:29] that has been broken but you've got to
[1:13:32] do something bring it into your own self
[1:13:35] it's personal means it's not someone
[1:13:38] else's experience maybe sister Amy you
[1:13:41] could put up that slide that I had there
[1:13:43] at the beginning of our opening
[1:13:44] scripture how many's thankful for the
[1:13:46] springtime
[1:13:48] and a new you you're thankful for the
[1:13:51] springtime I put this picture my wife
[1:13:53] actually took this photo of looking down
[1:13:56] a long road out of our our house because
[1:13:59] it's showing that there spring time has
[1:14:01] come but the Daniel Williams always
[1:14:03] loved this this time of the year in
[1:14:05] Louisiana because you see the lilacs you
[1:14:08] see the different flowers and you see
[1:14:10] after we've gone through a summer and
[1:14:12] through a fall and through us a winter
[1:14:16] that there's a spring again
[1:14:19] and it ought to give faith to every
[1:14:21] believer that there will be another
[1:14:23] spring there will be another cycle
[1:14:26] you're just going through a cycle
[1:14:28] brother or sister there will be another
[1:14:31] spring time for you it won't always be
[1:14:34] winter it won't always be cold and
[1:14:37] indifferent there will be another time
[1:14:39] when you rejoice again and your desert
[1:14:43] shall bloom again
[1:14:44] [Applause]
[1:14:45] hallelujah that situation is not for
[1:14:49] your end it's for the glory of God
[1:14:52] you're just going to a cycle I almost
[1:14:57] preached on the Easter and the
[1:14:58] resurrection cease and don't you feel it
[1:15:00] that we are in a resurrection season let
[1:15:03] that which is dead in your life come
[1:15:05] forth
[1:15:06] when you hear about the altar make it a
[1:15:09] personal altar
[1:15:13] so it's not the pastor's altar
[1:15:17] it's not the preacher or a friend it's
[1:15:21] you that God wants
[1:15:24] personal I just have that on the screen
[1:15:27] there for personal because person is
[1:15:30] part of personal it's a personal thing
[1:15:32] and as I thought about the service and
[1:15:36] what the Lord would have it to us to
[1:15:38] bring there was that one word of
[1:15:39] personal because it has to do with the
[1:15:42] individual your own altar it's special
[1:15:46] to you it's something that is a person
[1:15:49] that's up close that's up near it's
[1:15:52] become dear it's a specific person it's
[1:15:56] not to the group it's not just for
[1:16:00] everyone else
[1:16:01] have we failed the people to make it
[1:16:05] just for the crowd and the group and we
[1:16:08] want everyone and we want to speak in a
[1:16:10] way that will impress the preachers or
[1:16:12] sing in a way that will impress the
[1:16:14] masses or is it personal I
[1:16:18] believe if we came personal the Lord
[1:16:21] could consume our lives
[1:16:23] consume our church alter consume our
[1:16:26] marriage alter our family altars
[1:16:29] Lord make it all new again for us
[1:16:32] brother branham spoke the the seals
[1:16:35] through the March time and and he it
[1:16:38] just made the Bible become a new book to
[1:16:40] him
[1:16:41] some of us need that again we need the
[1:16:44] Bible to become fresh again the house of
[1:16:48] God to become fresh again I'm speaking
[1:16:51] to believers that I know believe the
[1:16:53] message
[1:16:55] can we make that a prayer today God
[1:16:58] become personal to me
[1:17:01] so to be personal is opposite than just
[1:17:05] to make it public it's personal and I
[1:17:08] was thinking of God in His Word and his
[1:17:11] presence and there's things about God
[1:17:14] that are private that are personal but
[1:17:16] today we ought to feel so happy that God
[1:17:19] has sent us a message that has revealed
[1:17:22] personal things with God that when the
[1:17:25] Bible says I have not seen or ear heard
[1:17:27] neither has to entered into the hearts
[1:17:30] of men people stop right there but the
[1:17:32] next verse says but God has revealed
[1:17:34] them to us
[1:17:36] hallelujah I begin to think of this and
[1:17:39] how that when brother Branham talked
[1:17:41] about the third Pole and the opening of
[1:17:43] the word in Jeffersonville that there
[1:17:46] was a promise under the third pool that
[1:17:48] it would not be a public show and he
[1:17:51] began to talk about a great big tent
[1:17:53] who's familiar with this what brother
[1:17:55] Branham talked about the third pool and
[1:17:57] then he saw a big tent he said it was
[1:18:00] packed and lined everywhere with people
[1:18:02] and I walked out and it looked like I
[1:18:04] was standing above the people looking
[1:18:06] down where I just made an altar call and
[1:18:09] hundreds and hundreds of people were
[1:18:11] weeping and rejoicing after they had
[1:18:13] accepted the Lord Jesus as their Savior
[1:18:16] how many love to be in that atmosphere
[1:18:19] where people are receiving the Lord
[1:18:23] Jesus as their personal Savior
[1:18:26] where the Holy Ghost is coming and
[1:18:29] falling on individuals
[1:18:33] vindicating their surrender
[1:18:36] vindicating the letting go their
[1:18:38] repenting and God just comes down and
[1:18:42] begins to do wonderful things
[1:18:44] isn't that fantastic I mean to be around
[1:18:47] when the shilling angel comes by a
[1:18:50] person I just said God for that
[1:18:58] as I was streaming the service and so
[1:19:02] sister Elana butts begin to run through
[1:19:05] the sanctuary run through here the
[1:19:07] healing angel came by this little
[1:19:10] sanctuary our hearts begin to rejoice
[1:19:13] and be happy but I don't want to stop
[1:19:16] there that's not just personal that puts
[1:19:20] something in a believer saying I need a
[1:19:22] healer that's my healer when I see God
[1:19:26] heal a teenager touch a mother touch a
[1:19:29] father
[1:19:31] like a brother on calling years ago and
[1:19:35] to have a prayer answered of a family
[1:19:38] know of a mother and of young people
[1:19:42] that weren't there daddy saved and now
[1:19:44] to have him seen and have the glory of
[1:19:47] God blessing people publicly but it took
[1:19:50] a private encounter of God getting a
[1:19:53] hold of a heart
[1:19:55] hallelujah that's not just in the Bible
[1:19:58] that's God coming down that's making it
[1:20:01] personal
[1:20:03] to where someone else can say God can do
[1:20:06] that for me
[1:20:08] can I go a little further where the
[1:20:11] Branham was looking down on the tent and
[1:20:13] he was looking down and seeing people go
[1:20:15] in there and coming out healed seeing
[1:20:18] them deliver and he he was wondering
[1:20:20] about that and I grew I heard a man say
[1:20:22] call the prayer line so altar calls and
[1:20:26] prayer lines seem to be surrounding the
[1:20:29] opening of the third pole and people
[1:20:32] begin to line up on this side and the
[1:20:34] left from where I was standing going
[1:20:36] down the platform they lined up all the
[1:20:38] way up and down the street for a prayer
[1:20:40] line I noticed to my left which would
[1:20:42] have been to my right on the platform
[1:20:45] wooden building and I seen that light
[1:20:47] that they've seen the picture of you
[1:20:49] know that's always in the meetings I
[1:20:51] seen that light leave me and go into
[1:20:54] that building and go into that building
[1:20:57] and a voice said to me I'll meet you in
[1:21:00] there
[1:21:01] that'll be the third pull and brother
[1:21:05] branham said why
[1:21:07] he said well it won't be a public show
[1:21:10] like the other and then brother Brennan
[1:21:14] said I come too so brother branham was
[1:21:17] describing the first poll in the second
[1:21:19] poll about how it was public but the
[1:21:23] third pour the opening of the word was
[1:21:26] not going to be a public show it was
[1:21:28] gonna be something personal something
[1:21:30] for the individual but once it happens
[1:21:33] privately it becomes public
[1:21:37] how many has started so amazing then
[1:21:40] around the world the first pull he would
[1:21:42] take him by the hand publicly and begin
[1:21:45] to know the secrets of their heart say
[1:21:48] they're diseased and there had to be a
[1:21:49] connection it was so powerful then the
[1:21:52] second pull was him knowing a person's
[1:21:54] name and their address and their need
[1:21:58] what was going through their past and
[1:22:00] their present have you ever thought
[1:22:02] about how personal that was
[1:22:04] how personal or God is when I felt to
[1:22:09] come this weekend there was one word
[1:22:11] kept just coming into my heart and I had
[1:22:13] to let it out and Cloverdale a little
[1:22:14] bit on Wednesday forgive me it's for
[1:22:16] this morning our God is a personal God
[1:22:20] [Applause]
[1:22:22] and he demonstrated that in the first
[1:22:24] pull and the second pull it was public
[1:22:27] you lady back there your name is Anita
[1:22:30] and you're married to this person and
[1:22:31] that person in and you lived here and
[1:22:34] you you live at this certain address and
[1:22:36] all people right behind her would say oh
[1:22:38] no he missed her there and then to find
[1:22:40] out later they had just moved the day
[1:22:42] before or God knows everything
[1:22:47] the name the address your personal
[1:22:49] identity has been released and
[1:22:53] publicly he begin to pronounce that but
[1:22:56] the voice said in that third pull it
[1:22:59] won't be a public show I
[1:23:06] want to say today about this personal
[1:23:09] God
[1:23:10] he's not distant and way out there
[1:23:14] and we believers today he's not a
[1:23:18] grandfather with a big beard agent just
[1:23:21] looking over the banister observing us
[1:23:23] this morning on April the 7th he's not
[1:23:27] looking over the banister like that he's
[1:23:30] not way beyond the stars and out in some
[1:23:32] galaxies God is present right in this
[1:23:35] room right now he's so personal yes he
[1:23:38] knows your name your address what you're
[1:23:40] going through but it's much deeper than
[1:23:42] that
[1:23:44] can I get some of you to come into the
[1:23:47] third room
[1:23:49] but it's not a public show
[1:23:52] it's not for everybody else it's for you
[1:23:56] God is so personal that he's not far
[1:24:00] away he's right in this room right now
[1:24:03] and he brought a channel like a radio
[1:24:06] like an antenna called a prophet that
[1:24:09] would be able to know and be able to see
[1:24:11] odd gets milky over here somebody over
[1:24:14] here and was just calling on God I was
[1:24:16] listening to a tape this week and
[1:24:18] brother Branham it was at the end of a
[1:24:20] service right after the seals and
[1:24:21] brother branham you could just hear the
[1:24:23] people responding he's just waiting
[1:24:25] waiting on God and the Holy Spirit was
[1:24:28] just waving through the building all of
[1:24:30] a sudden the sister just stood up and
[1:24:32] begin to respond with her hand like this
[1:24:34] and he said when that sister did that it
[1:24:37] was the Holy Spirit coming by her way
[1:24:43] we you've been in enough meetings you
[1:24:46] know when something different is
[1:24:48] happening
[1:24:49] it's because now it's personal
[1:24:56] we don't want an impersonal God
[1:25:00] we don't want to become a church or a
[1:25:02] family or a person that puts God
[1:25:05] somewhere else we want him to be
[1:25:08] personal stay with me friends people
[1:25:12] don't want a private God that will
[1:25:14] expose themselves you can come in the
[1:25:17] front room or you can come into our dog
[1:25:19] trainer come into our dress code or come
[1:25:21] into just the forty a but don't go any
[1:25:23] further
[1:25:24] no no God came into the front door to
[1:25:28] come to your private life
[1:25:30] then you say man to that we don't want a
[1:25:34] God that we cannot touch
[1:25:38] he's untouchable he's out there
[1:25:41] somewhere where we make altars to and
[1:25:44] the unknown God well brother it's just
[1:25:47] there no no no we want a God that we can
[1:25:49] touch
[1:25:53] Paul said it like this about a high
[1:25:55] priest that is touched with the feeling
[1:25:57] of our infirmities as you grow in Christ
[1:26:00] it should become more dearer he can be
[1:26:03] touched I
[1:26:05] just want to give him praise today by my
[1:26:09] faith in the sanctuary to say we have a
[1:26:13] high priest that can be touched with the
[1:26:16] feeling of what we're going through what
[1:26:18] our children are going through what our
[1:26:20] young people are going through
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:23] do you realize we are 30 years this year
[1:26:27] of this church having the camp out at
[1:26:31] Dry Creek
[1:26:33] from 1989 it started in 1987 but 30
[1:26:39] years now you have given of yourself and
[1:26:41] your Easter season for God to become
[1:26:45] personal
[1:26:47] have you ever thought about why this
[1:26:51] year within two or three weeks it was
[1:26:53] just totally full
[1:26:56] and
[1:26:57] the motels and everything people are
[1:27:00] booking what it's gonna be like this
[1:27:02] year
[1:27:03] why hasn't it gone from 800 to 700 five
[1:27:08] hundred to two hundred where it's just
[1:27:11] your dung people and a few more why
[1:27:14] it's because God has become personal
[1:27:17] to literally thousands around the globe
[1:27:22] this generation is hungry to have a God
[1:27:26] become personal to them not just quoting
[1:27:30] the words of a prophet or reading a
[1:27:32] scripture but having a burden that
[1:27:35] that word would become reality
[1:27:39] become tangible God
[1:27:46] we could go and we can take a lot of
[1:27:48] time we could talk about the altar that
[1:27:51] Noah had the Abel had that Jacob had
[1:27:55] when you look into the Bible it speaks
[1:27:57] about how they build an altar unto the
[1:27:59] Lord Moses had an altar do you remember
[1:28:02] Abraham and Isaac
[1:28:04] Isaac was on an altar do you remember
[1:28:08] that in the Old Testament Aaron and the
[1:28:11] prop of the priest
[1:28:12] worked around the altar
[1:28:16] keep the altar open
[1:28:18] that was actually their duty and their
[1:28:21] ministry is to work around the altar
[1:28:24] they had an altar of incense they had
[1:28:28] the burnt offering they had the brazen
[1:28:30] altar they had the altar of brass they
[1:28:33] had the altar of gold the Bible speaks
[1:28:36] about blood on the altar
[1:28:38] fire on the altar do you remember that
[1:28:42] and there was to be a light continually
[1:28:45] keep the lamp going and in the days of
[1:28:49] Eli sin had come in to the message so
[1:28:52] much the lamp of God went out their eyes
[1:28:55] become dim sin came in unto where the
[1:29:00] the very worship in the church became a
[1:29:02] stitch to the people
[1:29:04] God may have never returned back to us
[1:29:09] to our marriages to our families our
[1:29:13] this church where we allow the altar to
[1:29:17] be just something that God doesn't even
[1:29:19] want to be there
[1:29:21] when we just put in time and put in the
[1:29:24] little songs and here a little message
[1:29:25] where we lose interest we lose attention
[1:29:29] we lose love I
[1:29:32] say God if that has happened to me or to
[1:29:37] us let us repair the altar today
[1:29:41] let us say God restore unto me restore
[1:29:46] unto us bring back the new again bring
[1:29:50] back the freshness again
[1:29:52] can you say that today what I want to
[1:29:56] know you personal
[1:30:00] put it in my heart guard
[1:30:05] the altar speaks of dedication and you
[1:30:08] giving an offering the Bible speaks
[1:30:11] about the charge of the sanctuary and
[1:30:13] the charge of the altar the there was
[1:30:17] something called the charge of the altar
[1:30:20] and it was placed into the hands of the
[1:30:22] Levites and of the priests to keep this
[1:30:25] charge when you look in Joshua's day as
[1:30:28] everybody attention
[1:30:30] Joshua and that bringing that into the
[1:30:34] new generation the altar is associated
[1:30:37] with the new land
[1:30:39] which is a type of the Holy Ghost so
[1:30:42] when you look in the days of Joshua they
[1:30:44] build an altar the altars of bail was
[1:30:48] false gods and the Jehovah God never
[1:30:51] came down and vindicated that altar it
[1:30:54] was the one true Living God that when
[1:30:57] Elijah prepared it God came down
[1:31:00] [Music]
[1:31:01] how many's ever heard a phrase the horns
[1:31:04] of the altar just lift your hand as
[1:31:06] you've heard of the horns it comes from
[1:31:09] the Bible where they had horns that was
[1:31:12] literally on the ark and on the mercy
[1:31:14] seat that if someone in trouble someone
[1:31:16] that was in desperation could run in and
[1:31:18] grab ahold of his horns and say God have
[1:31:22] mercy
[1:31:23] our grace
[1:31:26] having trouble and they would run into
[1:31:30] the temple and they would fall in an
[1:31:32] altar and grab ahold of these I tell you
[1:31:35] I pray that never leaves us brother Tim
[1:31:37] I pray the horns of the altar would be
[1:31:40] always available I
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:46] understand what I'm saying right now in
[1:31:48] many places that's been gone that that's
[1:31:50] shunned they don't want an altar they
[1:31:53] don't want tears they don't want
[1:31:55] repentance they just want a little
[1:31:57] service and let's go have lunch
[1:31:59] our stomachs are calling you know we got
[1:32:02] schedules maybe God wants to break that
[1:32:05] schedule I
[1:32:08] don't want to be too long today but we
[1:32:10] do an altar speaks of death
[1:32:13] sacrifice giving of yourself
[1:32:17] we have it so good today there's been an
[1:32:21] attraction to the anointed ministry for
[1:32:24] the Bride of Christ it's like you can
[1:32:26] just go and listen and they've been
[1:32:28] laying in the word for hours they've
[1:32:30] been studying and making sure they're
[1:32:32] saying exactly what the Prophet said we
[1:32:36] can come in and Maya can be such an
[1:32:38] inspiration do you know that is only the
[1:32:41] first room you
[1:32:42] live in a three-room house and the
[1:32:46] kitchen is the church it's a public
[1:32:49] place that's where we come and feed off
[1:32:52] of the word and can you believe it
[1:32:55] people become so casual about that altar
[1:33:00] then the second room is like a parlor
[1:33:02] like a living room you you go from the
[1:33:05] kitchen and then you go into the parlor
[1:33:07] you kind of talk a little bit more share
[1:33:08] a little bit how's your business going
[1:33:10] how's your school going I
[1:33:14] really appreciate that brother and what
[1:33:18] you're going through or your school is
[1:33:21] ending oh and may all your graduating in
[1:33:24] May what are you studying oh it's
[1:33:26] engineering and you get to know people
[1:33:29] on in the parlor in the living in the
[1:33:31] living room we can share about Christ
[1:33:33] and what he's done in your life I look
[1:33:36] up and see sister Amy and just newly
[1:33:38] married
[1:33:39] as brother Tim said this is a reflection
[1:33:43] of what the message can produce young
[1:33:47] people that can go for years and be
[1:33:49] tested and tested and wonder if is there
[1:33:51] ever gonna be anyone and God just
[1:33:53] crowned their lives right before the
[1:33:56] rapture
[1:33:58] say how much time do we have left I
[1:34:01] don't know
[1:34:02] but God still has private altars that
[1:34:07] become public I
[1:34:10] would encourage you to this this
[1:34:13] afternoon
[1:34:14] that if God is leading you to the horns
[1:34:17] of the altar if there's something in
[1:34:18] your heart to say I am wrong forgive me
[1:34:21] God find a place
[1:34:28] the altar speaks of surrender
[1:34:31] that speaks of you admitting I am wrong
[1:34:34] I want to get into that in just a little
[1:34:37] bit let me just go back to David and
[1:34:39] Solomon and the temple spoke of the
[1:34:41] altar Hezekiah in second chronicles
[1:34:45] repaired the altar so it wasn't just a
[1:34:47] major prophet but it's now other minor
[1:34:50] prophets Isaiah prophesied about the
[1:34:53] altar can you put Joel chapter 1 verse
[1:34:57] 13 up and see that even in the book of
[1:34:59] Joel
[1:35:01] how that it was a place that the
[1:35:03] ministry was to
[1:35:05] bring this altar before the people and
[1:35:08] there was a crying out at the altar it's
[1:35:12] not just a half hour of silence it's
[1:35:15] actually there's something in you crying
[1:35:17] out
[1:35:18] Joel 1:13
[1:35:22] gird yourselves and lament he priest how
[1:35:26] the ministers of the altar come lie all
[1:35:31] night in sackcloth the ministers of my
[1:35:33] God for the meat offering and the drink
[1:35:36] offering is withholding from the house
[1:35:38] of our God or what the people need to
[1:35:41] overcome is being withholding
[1:35:49] no no cry out
[1:35:52] can you go to Joel to verse 17 you can
[1:35:56] read this later when you go home but
[1:35:58] Joel 2:17 speaks about this also about
[1:36:02] the ministry and the men ministers let
[1:36:05] the priests the ministers of the Lord
[1:36:06] weep between the porch and the altar and
[1:36:09] let them say spare thy people O Lord and
[1:36:13] give not mine heritage to reproach that
[1:36:16] the heathen should rule over them
[1:36:21] wherefore should they say among the
[1:36:23] people where is their God
[1:36:26] we ought to bring this right into this
[1:36:28] morning service as Moses God spoke to
[1:36:32] Moses and said just step back I'll
[1:36:34] destroy the whole group
[1:36:36] and it was Christ in Moses that stood in
[1:36:39] the way and say no Lord look at what you
[1:36:42] did to bring him out of Egypt look at
[1:36:45] all their testimonies and what you did
[1:36:47] Lord if you destroy them then what will
[1:36:50] the enemy say that you were not able to
[1:36:54] keep them in the time of wilderness and
[1:36:56] fulfill your word and bringing them into
[1:36:59] the land brother Branham said that was
[1:37:01] Christ in Moses
[1:37:04] amen oh
[1:37:07] we had it in our day of brother Branham
[1:37:09] speaking the seventh actually it was the
[1:37:11] Lamb that broke the seven seals and then
[1:37:13] as they went through the summer time
[1:37:15] brother brother Middleton and they came
[1:37:17] up to September but the Branham preached
[1:37:19] the token and then desperation and he
[1:37:24] said that was the message to follow the
[1:37:27] opening of the seven seals as far as a
[1:37:30] message to preach so there are messages
[1:37:32] to follow the opening of the word
[1:37:36] that is to get personal with the people
[1:37:39] and their families
[1:37:41] is the message getting through this
[1:37:45] morning bring the opening of the seven
[1:37:47] seals the third pull and bring it down
[1:37:49] to the fire please so the daddies can
[1:37:52] apply it literally the
[1:37:54] mothers can know the young people can
[1:37:57] know
[1:37:58] when they share may see the dark clouds
[1:38:01] coming through the town destroying their
[1:38:04] friends oh where is that young person
[1:38:07] where is that young lady oh they were
[1:38:09] overtaken
[1:38:11] sister Amy can you put up that scripture
[1:38:13] again Joel 2:17 what does the ministry
[1:38:16] supposed to do when this happens
[1:38:20] are we supposed to be quiet about it
[1:38:22] don't say anything about it no there is
[1:38:26] to be a crying out
[1:38:31] spare thy people Oh God
[1:38:34] there must be an understanding that the
[1:38:38] new generation has gone through 10 times
[1:38:40] what we went through
[1:38:43] there must be an understanding that the
[1:38:46] word is gonna connect with them
[1:38:50] amos spoke about this thank you sister
[1:38:53] Amy Zechariah if you could bring back up
[1:38:55] that side Zechariah spoke about the
[1:38:57] altar do you know that Malachi spoke
[1:39:00] about the altar let's bring it into the
[1:39:02] New Testament quickly Paul in Hebrews 13
[1:39:05] verse 10 said we have an altar
[1:39:09] - some would say oh that's Old Testament
[1:39:12] Christ is our altar
[1:39:16] amen Paul said we have an altar in
[1:39:21] revelations chapter 6 verse 9 the Bible
[1:39:24] says their souls under the altar under
[1:39:26] the fifth seal souls under the altar
[1:39:29] later in the Book of Revelations there's
[1:39:31] voices that are come out of the altar so
[1:39:34] from Genesis to Revelation it speaks of
[1:39:37] an altar
[1:39:39] can I bring it now to this morning to us
[1:39:42] as believers we've got to have a
[1:39:44] personal altar I
[1:39:47] pray God would touch our hearts as
[1:39:49] believers more and more as we see the
[1:39:53] Day approaching
[1:39:54] that our services and our meetings
[1:39:57] would have God connecting with
[1:40:04] our prayer life if you're making notes
[1:40:08] it's part of our personal altars you say
[1:40:12] I don't even hardly have one brother
[1:40:13] John I really don't know what you're
[1:40:15] talking about
[1:40:16] God restore our prayer life
[1:40:20] pick up that rock that's fallen off and
[1:40:23] do something today and say God I want
[1:40:26] that to be restored in my life can we do
[1:40:30] that friends some of you know what I'm
[1:40:32] talking about
[1:40:33] repairing the altar
[1:40:36] bringing it back to where it ought to be
[1:40:39] not a public show
[1:40:42] but for you as a person to say I need
[1:40:45] that more in my life let's be real today
[1:40:50] but the brothers should you ministers
[1:40:52] and you pastors know that you don't pray
[1:40:54] as much as your father's did he said you
[1:40:58] mothers and fathers no you don't pray
[1:41:00] like your mother and your father did you
[1:41:03] know what we just need to say that's the
[1:41:04] truth and
[1:41:06] don't get all condemned about it just
[1:41:09] lift up the rock today and say God I
[1:41:11] want that place to become more dear to
[1:41:13] me
[1:41:15] what about the Word of God we know it's
[1:41:18] true we know it's read your Bible and
[1:41:20] pray every day but friends have we lost
[1:41:22] something
[1:41:24] say brother John yeah it's true I hardly
[1:41:27] read my Bible I hardly get into the
[1:41:29] message myself
[1:41:31] pick that rock up today just pick it up
[1:41:36] say it's just a little rock a little
[1:41:38] scripture
[1:41:42] you got five minutes you got ten minutes
[1:41:46] you got half an hour you listen to the
[1:41:48] news
[1:41:50] or you read this newspaper you look at
[1:41:52] that article
[1:41:54] or it's just silent in your home
[1:41:57] God's giving you the opportunity to
[1:41:59] listen to a word
[1:42:01] listen to a message
[1:42:04] what about our personal surrender and
[1:42:07] our dedication I want to rebuild that
[1:42:10] today lord
[1:42:11] surrounding our lives with the right
[1:42:13] atmosphere
[1:42:16] you have a choice of your friends
[1:42:20] you can't choose your family but you can
[1:42:23] choose your friends
[1:42:24] amen so if you say I'm building the
[1:42:27] altar then get around people that love
[1:42:29] God and are positive and let me
[1:42:32] encourage you you'll be a positive
[1:42:33] person we only have one life I'm
[1:42:37] speaking about an altar today say that's
[1:42:40] not always fun and games up on an altar
[1:42:43] where there's blood and screaming and
[1:42:45] crying you're exactly right
[1:42:49] but well there can be more of a
[1:42:51] sacrifice of praise
[1:42:54] even when you don't feel like it
[1:42:57] like maybe Paul and Silas in in a prison
[1:43:01] cell they've been whipped and whipped
[1:43:03] they could have got grumpy and texting
[1:43:06] one another how do you feel how do you
[1:43:07] feel man I'm hurting oh man he got into
[1:43:10] the muscle on that one they were
[1:43:12] praising
[1:43:13] they were shouting
[1:43:17] but we've received the third poll and
[1:43:20] we've gone through the ages now in the
[1:43:22] opening of the word then there ought to
[1:43:23] be some men and women that might feel
[1:43:26] like they're in the stocks
[1:43:27] financially or emotionally or
[1:43:29] health-wise if this is go but there
[1:43:32] ought to be a praise
[1:43:36] you say I don't know brother John you're
[1:43:38] preaching away out there I'm coming
[1:43:40] right down to you God can create that
[1:43:43] and give you a love for the things of
[1:43:46] God that's personal
[1:43:50] what about the body of Christ and the
[1:43:52] people of God that we should love and
[1:43:55] daily living in his presence and walking
[1:43:58] in a love affair do you know that from
[1:44:00] Genesis to Revelation over 300 times the
[1:44:03] word altar is mentioned in the Bible
[1:44:05] brother Branham it mentions the word
[1:44:08] altar
[1:44:10] 2488 times in the message is that a lot
[1:44:15] that's almost 2 times per message if you
[1:44:18] take twelve hundred messages
[1:44:20] 2488 times he mentions the word altar
[1:44:24] that's twice per message
[1:44:26] he believed in an altar in fact from
[1:44:31] 1947 all the way to communion message in
[1:44:36] the communion message 12:12 his last
[1:44:39] recorded words he mentions the altar his
[1:44:43] last service of leadership that he
[1:44:46] preached brother Branham had an altar
[1:44:48] call
[1:44:50] it has to do with the opening of the
[1:44:53] word his last
[1:44:57] think about this his last duties as a
[1:45:01] prophet was to have an altar call and
[1:45:03] then have communion
[1:45:07] his last message in Jeffersonville which
[1:45:11] was where his church was and he felt at
[1:45:13] liberty and Satan's Eden do you know
[1:45:16] that the Branham Tabernacle which is
[1:45:18] where I was born and raised it was so
[1:45:20] packed out of people when brother
[1:45:22] Branham was there chairs all the way up
[1:45:24] to the front they were sitting on the
[1:45:26] altar and you hear brother brown said
[1:45:28] there's not room here for an altar call
[1:45:32] but make your heart and altar who's
[1:45:35] never heard that before he said
[1:45:37] did brother Branham believe in altar
[1:45:39] calls right up to the very last service
[1:45:42] of Satan deed and it's so packed out him
[1:45:44] and the platform's packed out the
[1:45:47] Baptist three pack
[1:45:51] you listen to the end of that message
[1:45:54] his last service in the Brenham
[1:45:56] Tabernacle he's making it a public altar
[1:45:59] he said you pray for me and I'll pray
[1:46:01] for you there's something sacred about
[1:46:04] this altar that speaks of surrendering
[1:46:09] I'm not doing exercises today but I
[1:46:11] wonder if you could take both your hands
[1:46:13] and just go like this some of you have
[1:46:15] notes and you're right but surrender
[1:46:20] it means I gotcha
[1:46:23] it's a military term for just give up I
[1:46:28] pray our messages become more than words
[1:46:31] only and just teaching or talking or
[1:46:34] just describing things on a overhead and
[1:46:37] to where we just leave with no personal
[1:46:40] altar
[1:46:42] and we'll carry this over to tonight's
[1:46:44] service but you can actually go to a
[1:46:46] church altar or a public altar and never
[1:46:49] make it to a personal altar
[1:46:51] you can get caught up under emotion or
[1:46:54] caught up under something and it just
[1:46:56] doesn't last you wonder why it never
[1:46:58] became personal
[1:47:01] we've been born and raised in the
[1:47:03] message brother John we've seen the
[1:47:05] cycles but people preaching the message
[1:47:08] song reading the message choirs in the
[1:47:12] message and churches and
[1:47:14] a few years go by those same people are
[1:47:18] out in the world
[1:47:19] they went away from their personal altar
[1:47:22] - some would say they never even knew
[1:47:25] Christ they never even had the Holy
[1:47:27] Ghost
[1:47:27] is that incredible people that were
[1:47:31] delivered from smoking and drinking it
[1:47:33] gave testimonies where you know you
[1:47:35] don't even feel like your testimonies
[1:47:37] you don't have a testimony when they
[1:47:39] give their testimonies
[1:47:41] is that true who's ever felt like that I
[1:47:44] mean some people they're just so way up
[1:47:45] in the heavens and you look you and then
[1:47:48] a few years go by and they're just right
[1:47:50] and there's just still something in your
[1:47:51] heart go on with God go on with God
[1:47:54] people collapse
[1:47:56] I
[1:47:57] would encourage you today find a
[1:48:00] personal altar where you can wrestle it
[1:48:04] out with God is I God great is our God
[1:48:10] mighty he's not way out there he's a
[1:48:12] personal God
[1:48:15] [Music]
[1:48:16] it's a place of yielding and dying out
[1:48:20] where spirits leave
[1:48:23] carnality and unbelief is laid up on the
[1:48:25] altar I
[1:48:28] remember when I was in a camp service
[1:48:30] and we were in the camp meeting in a
[1:48:33] great big tent and the lights went out
[1:48:36] in the buildings the power went off I
[1:48:39] didn't care I was a young man sitting
[1:48:43] back this way here and I just leaned
[1:48:46] forward in my chair and the preacher
[1:48:48] kept on preaching and I tried to find a
[1:48:50] little flashlight that was before the
[1:48:52] days of iPads and all that where they
[1:48:54] could just keep it was you know they had
[1:48:55] their notes and trying to bring a pirate
[1:48:57] brother Joe Walden there I remember him
[1:48:59] running up there'd with a little
[1:49:00] microphone or a little flashlight you
[1:49:03] remember that sister Cathy and they're
[1:49:04] trying to get a light to the preacher so
[1:49:07] he could keep preaching now it's totally
[1:49:08] black he just keeps preaching preaching
[1:49:10] and when they made an altar cope for the
[1:49:13] German was the first one to the altar
[1:49:15] but it was so packed out and fold that
[1:49:18] not one Minister ever prayed for me a
[1:49:22] counselor didn't pray for me my mother
[1:49:25] didn't come up my father didn't come up
[1:49:27] my friends didn't come up I was so close
[1:49:30] brother Joe and was just packed around
[1:49:33] me I go back to that and I say it's not
[1:49:36] just the preacher it's not just my
[1:49:39] friends it's not my spouse it's doing
[1:49:43] ahold of God
[1:49:45] we need those experiences don't get me
[1:49:49] wrong friends it can happen in your
[1:49:50] house
[1:49:52] I'm speaking about a private personal
[1:49:55] altar it's not a public show it can
[1:49:59] happen in the public but the main thing
[1:50:02] is find a personal place I
[1:50:04] believe it's good for ministers to pray
[1:50:06] for others and spouses and loved ones
[1:50:09] and friends I believe in that don't get
[1:50:10] me wrong I see some of you looking at me
[1:50:12] wondering where I'm coming from well I
[1:50:14] came from heaven and I'm going back to
[1:50:16] heaven
[1:50:18] we've been through this so long it's
[1:50:21] more than words and quotes and all of
[1:50:23] that it's finding a God that's personal
[1:50:25] if you really want to get down to the
[1:50:28] bottom line that's the need
[1:50:30] if people could just connect with Jesus
[1:50:33] do you believe that the altar is a place
[1:50:37] of prayer and I want to say this maybe
[1:50:41] to take something off of someone's
[1:50:43] shoulders
[1:50:46] just because someone comes to the altar
[1:50:49] don't mean that their backs lit
[1:50:52] some people have it in their minds oh if
[1:50:55] I go forward that means there's sin in
[1:50:57] my life or I'm back slid or oh there
[1:51:00] there goes that person there's they must
[1:51:02] be sinning
[1:51:04] the altar is more than just for
[1:51:07] backsliders it's for worshipers it's to
[1:51:11] be a place of prayer it's to be for a
[1:51:15] place that for a person that needs
[1:51:17] prayer
[1:51:20] they want to move out of the normal
[1:51:24] move out of just me bringing my children
[1:51:27] to church and worried about their
[1:51:30] diapers and and their little graham
[1:51:32] crackers and oh I gotta take care of my
[1:51:34] baby it's a mother it's a daddy
[1:51:37] that knows I have personal spiritual
[1:51:41] needs
[1:51:41] I've seen it before
[1:51:44] I've seen mother's hand off their babies
[1:51:46] and go walking down to the altar
[1:51:49] I've heard about the nursery becoming a
[1:51:52] place where mothers get away and they
[1:51:55] talk and they chat and they they're
[1:51:57] connected to one another blood about
[1:51:59] what's going on friends I pray that
[1:52:00] wouldn't happen here the sanctuary ought
[1:52:04] to be a refuge in a place that our
[1:52:07] children are our young people that
[1:52:09] they're not encouraged to leave the
[1:52:11] sanctuary
[1:52:12] daddies and mommies just always walking
[1:52:14] around and having another place in the
[1:52:17] fellowship hall I hope I'm not stepping
[1:52:18] on nobody's toes but I hope I'm stepping
[1:52:21] on somebody's toes
[1:52:25] it almost gets to a place where little
[1:52:28] children they want to be bad and cried
[1:52:29] so they know they can leave and they can
[1:52:32] get out of here
[1:52:34] it's nothing about the devil when the
[1:52:38] altar ought to be a place and your altar
[1:52:41] of your heart ought to be a sanctified
[1:52:43] place and
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:46] let's blow up the dust of the day and
[1:52:50] the tears of life
[1:52:52] and can I help you brother Adams
[1:52:56] let's blow off some of those devils and
[1:52:59] demons
[1:53:00] Devils come and lie to our young ladies
[1:53:03] through the week and bring depression
[1:53:05] and suicide we are under authority of
[1:53:08] the Holy Spirit to cast out those devil
[1:53:12] before the person even reaches the altar
[1:53:15] there ought to be enough power in our
[1:53:17] words to scatter off the devil
[1:53:21] there ought to be weeping and crying
[1:53:23] [Applause]
[1:53:33] there are the Bieber men and women cry
[1:53:35] in the pews where they cry out to God
[1:53:39] and say it's me god I've been an
[1:53:41] unfaithful father I've been unfaithful
[1:53:43] wives
[1:53:46] my hands are unclean I feel like putting
[1:53:49] them in my pocket or in my purses
[1:53:52] but the Holy Spirit just washing just
[1:53:55] cleansing
[1:53:57] it's like you said I'm unworthy I'm
[1:53:59] little I'm embarrassed it's like I'm so
[1:54:02] ashamed
[1:54:04] the Holy Ghost coming to your altar
[1:54:07] taking out demons rooting up complexes
[1:54:12] right while you'd hear the word it's
[1:54:15] like the power of the word
[1:54:20] is there a people that want to move out
[1:54:23] from just being natural
[1:54:26] into the supernatural
[1:54:29] sometimes it's a person that doesn't
[1:54:32] just want to say a prayer they need to
[1:54:35] pray a prayer
[1:54:37] do you know the difference you say a
[1:54:40] prayer and you go along you come in you
[1:54:42] go out same desire same lack of love
[1:54:45] same movie just the same Oprah know
[1:54:48] there's a person that finally gets to
[1:54:49] the place I'm gonna pray a prayer I
[1:54:52] don't care who's preaching today I don't
[1:54:55] care what's going on in the church
[1:54:57] there might have been a distraction on
[1:55:00] the way to church
[1:55:01] last night or Friday
[1:55:04] where are those people that begin to cry
[1:55:07] out to God
[1:55:09] do you know in the Branham tabernacle
[1:55:11] brother Branham in church order talked
[1:55:13] about people coming to the altar and
[1:55:15] praying before the service and and
[1:55:19] brother Daniel cross he's already left
[1:55:21] but he said he remembers that years ago
[1:55:23] as a young boy before the service come
[1:55:26] into the altar and his father would come
[1:55:28] up and the little boys would come up and
[1:55:30] pray with their daddies
[1:55:37] you know what if we had the altar call
[1:55:40] at the beginning of the service then we
[1:55:42] had the singing in the preaching what
[1:55:44] would our services be like if we had men
[1:55:46] and women not just come forward but in
[1:55:48] their pews they begin to say God I need
[1:55:51] you today
[1:55:52] have an altar
[1:55:56] amen what if they got their sins under
[1:56:00] the blood they knew that they needed
[1:56:02] more or they started to say what brother
[1:56:04] Brennan said revelation is the greatest
[1:56:07] thing we should be crying out for cry
[1:56:09] out for revelation God just bow your
[1:56:12] head and say lord I need more revelation
[1:56:14] at the start of the service
[1:56:17] how many terms as the Holy Ghost fell in
[1:56:20] a meeting
[1:56:21] and within a half-hour brother Middleton
[1:56:25] within just a half hour people go out
[1:56:27] they talk they did they talked in the
[1:56:29] parking lot they go home and the whole
[1:56:31] atmosphere is lost in an hour who's ever
[1:56:35] seen that before oh nobody has I'm sorry
[1:56:38] we've all felt that before we seen God
[1:56:41] talking directly to a situation
[1:56:49] this is real deep today isn't it
[1:56:57] I'm just pulled between tonight service
[1:57:00] because I want to speak tonight on
[1:57:02] impacted by the wine and oil
[1:57:05] when you and I was like that person that
[1:57:08] was going down life's Road and Satan
[1:57:10] wanted to rip us and tear us and break
[1:57:12] us up
[1:57:15] but there came by someone that poured in
[1:57:17] oil and wine
[1:57:19] they poured in the Holy Ghost they
[1:57:22] poured in some stimulation
[1:57:25] that got us up on our feet again and we
[1:57:29] were taken to the inn to the church and
[1:57:32] the Holy Spirit spoke to the ministers
[1:57:35] and said take care of them until I come
[1:57:39] back again and if there's anything
[1:57:40] lacking I'll make it up then
[1:57:43] that's why we're unselfish that's why
[1:57:47] we're willing to pour out our lives
[1:57:48] because our reward is not here that's
[1:57:52] also here that's not here it's over
[1:57:55] there
[1:57:59] and I want to speak to
[1:58:02] personally to this assembly as we come
[1:58:05] up to the Easter camp and the young
[1:58:07] people's meetings how that God is poured
[1:58:10] in oil is it okay brother Tim to prepare
[1:58:13] you God's poured in oil in your life and
[1:58:15] wine into your life then we have a
[1:58:17] responsibility for others to create an
[1:58:21] atmosphere for somebody else this is
[1:58:24] crying out that is meaning
[1:58:28] say why do you preachers preach under
[1:58:31] such intensity why are you so burdened
[1:58:35] I'll tell you something to happen to me
[1:58:38] not just last Wednesday but the
[1:58:40] Wednesday before can I be personal I
[1:58:45] had heard in the morning about
[1:58:50] 9/11
[1:58:51] September 11th 2001 and about the audio
[1:58:56] voices and the recordings of people that
[1:59:00] were inside the World Trade Centers does
[1:59:03] anybody know what I'm talking about you
[1:59:05] older one 9/11 2001
[1:59:07] and the world so an outside view of
[1:59:10] these airplanes crashing into these two
[1:59:12] buildings and it was horrible and
[1:59:15] horrible in flames and and another
[1:59:18] airplane crashing into the planes flight
[1:59:22] 93 crashing into the field and killing
[1:59:26] more
[1:59:27] but what I heard was now as we saw the
[1:59:29] outside but there were thousands of men
[1:59:32] and women on the inside that were
[1:59:35] trapped and I heard the audible voices
[1:59:38] of them calling 911 911 there was over
[1:59:46] 3,000 calls in the first ten minutes it
[1:59:50] flooded the
[1:59:52] 911 I heard answering machine messages
[1:59:56] of
[1:59:57] people calling their spouses and calling
[2:00:00] homes this is the last recorded words
[2:00:06] their last recorded words I
[2:00:09] listened to Kevin cost growth his last
[2:00:12] words he was on for 105 and he's leaving
[2:00:17] a message with the 911 operator were
[2:00:19] young men we're not ready to die I need
[2:00:23] oxygen there's three people with me and
[2:00:26] you hear him talking back and forth with
[2:00:29] a 911 operator and then you see they got
[2:00:32] it time coded in a video and the whole
[2:00:35] tower just collapses and his phone goes
[2:00:38] dead I
[2:00:39] heard Melissa Joey and floor 83 of the
[2:00:43] World Trade Center she said I've got
[2:00:45] five people with me in the office call
[2:00:48] the 911 having trouble breathing I'm
[2:00:52] gonna die a night and the operators
[2:00:55] saying ma'am ma'am ma'am say her prayers
[2:00:58] stay calm stay calm
[2:01:02] she's screaming help help I hear voices
[2:01:05] this is Melissa's voice inside the trade
[2:01:08] tinner can't you stay on the line with
[2:01:10] me now she said to the operators stay on
[2:01:13] the line with me she's grabbing ahold of
[2:01:16] somebody that's alive
[2:01:20] then she said I think I'm dying
[2:01:23] as the oxygen and the smoke overtake her
[2:01:26] I heard the voices of air traffic
[2:01:28] controllers wondering why this is all
[2:01:30] happening wonder why flight 93 is going
[2:01:33] away and then crashing I heard the last
[2:01:35] words of the lead terrace in the
[2:01:38] airplane screaming it's okay it's okay
[2:01:42] I'll say this right before he was placed
[2:01:47] into the regions of the loss
[2:01:51] thinking by a false god he was going to
[2:01:54] have all these virgins and all this if
[2:01:57] you just kill these certain people
[2:02:00] he believed alive
[2:02:03] now is it in an airplane saying to all
[2:02:06] these people you hear his last words
[2:02:09] it's gonna be okay it's going to be okay
[2:02:11] stay in your seats I
[2:02:15] want to say today we serve a god that's
[2:02:18] greater than all of those lives how can
[2:02:21] we disbelieve the lie that Satan Satan
[2:02:24] comes in and gives lies I think we need
[2:02:27] to push them off today when God's so
[2:02:29] rich in mercy has given us a message I
[2:02:36] heard the last words of the people in
[2:02:40] the flight 93 that was crashing in the
[2:02:42] field is this okay I'm just a minister
[2:02:44] in my study on a Wednesday getting ready
[2:02:47] to preach and I was listening to some of
[2:02:49] this I was weeping I was crying I had to
[2:02:52] follow my knees before God
[2:02:55] you're not worried about everybody else
[2:02:57] in the Deacon and the print it's like me
[2:03:00] Oh God
[2:03:02] we don't know if we're in a service it's
[2:03:05] our last time and this isn't emotion by
[2:03:08] the way this is reality and I think
[2:03:11] sometimes what is it gonna take to shake
[2:03:14] us
[2:03:15] to reality where men and women can come
[2:03:19] into the presence of God and be smitten
[2:03:22] with his presence
[2:03:25] the last words of the whole plane
[2:03:28] screaming as they crashed into the field
[2:03:31] I heard
[2:03:32] Trade Center B which is the second tower
[2:03:34] voice is saying I want you to know that
[2:03:37] I love you and I'm stuck in this
[2:03:38] building the last words coming out of
[2:03:40] there to a family mother I want you to
[2:03:43] know that I love you and I'm in this
[2:03:45] building and I think a bomb has gone off
[2:03:47] they didn't know what would happen you
[2:03:50] can hear it from the September 11th
[2:03:53] attacks and many people tried to make
[2:03:55] contact and leave messages their final
[2:03:58] words to loved ones I
[2:04:03] actually heard parents of the deceased
[2:04:05] speak about their son or their daughter
[2:04:08] speaking their last words that they
[2:04:10] heard on an answering machine this is my
[2:04:12] last comment on this there was one man
[2:04:14] that was a retired contractor and he
[2:04:18] hardly ever answers his phone because he
[2:04:20] said people just call him always wanting
[2:04:22] him to do things for free or help him
[2:04:24] out with this but this morning he got a
[2:04:26] call at a certain time and this that
[2:04:28] morning he picked up the phone it was
[2:04:29] his daughter
[2:04:31] calling from the World Trade Center
[2:04:35] and she's screaming us he just calm down
[2:04:38] calm down tell me what's going on and Oh
[2:04:40] dad there's been a bomb go off in the
[2:04:42] building what am I to do what am I to
[2:04:44] doing it flicks on the television and he
[2:04:46] sees it right there - Trade Centers on
[2:04:49] fire and he doesn't tell her but he just
[2:04:51] begins to speak about to go to the
[2:04:53] nearest exit and go here and go down and
[2:04:55] little did he know but all the exits
[2:04:57] were closed over it was the last time he
[2:04:59] spoke to his daughter
[2:05:01] her name was Melissa Hughes from floor
[2:05:05] 101
[2:05:07] voices from within
[2:05:10] voices from within
[2:05:12] we were watching the outside but there
[2:05:15] was voices from within and I wonder
[2:05:18] brother Tim how many of us today are
[2:05:20] interested about the true voice from
[2:05:24] within of our people of our loved ones
[2:05:27] of our family I
[2:05:29] believe ourselves
[2:05:32] that's cried out and I pray God would
[2:05:37] shake us
[2:05:39] so that these things become more of a
[2:05:42] reality to us can this church agree with
[2:05:44] me today Lord make it more personal
[2:05:53] little did Nana know when I was
[2:05:55] preaching that night and sharing that
[2:05:56] with the church that just a few minutes
[2:05:59] before midnight a husband and wife in
[2:06:02] the message were just speaking just
[2:06:04] miles from the church just talking to
[2:06:07] one another and the sister goes into the
[2:06:10] washroom and she comes back out and her
[2:06:13] husband's already gone
[2:06:15] no pulse foaming-at-the-mouth
[2:06:19] gone
[2:06:20] they call their family their family was
[2:06:24] nurses and medical they do CP can you
[2:06:27] imagine doing a CPR on your own father
[2:06:30] call the daughter she's also in the
[2:06:33] medical they all come try to resuscitate
[2:06:35] their daddy you talk about traumatic
[2:06:37] call the paramedics it was over by 12:10
[2:06:41] it was all over within just hours of a
[2:06:46] minister preaching this way it was over
[2:06:49] for someone that just happened friends
[2:06:52] in the last days I say God help us as
[2:06:56] individuals to make this word more
[2:07:00] personal
[2:07:02] and if you are where you need to be with
[2:07:05] God we need to be more burden for others
[2:07:08] that are around us
[2:07:14] we need to shake off becoming so common
[2:07:17] with one another that we lose the
[2:07:20] feeling
[2:07:28] just this last week I was communicating
[2:07:30] with her well knowin Minister in the
[2:07:33] message
[2:07:35] he said my heart is broken just
[2:07:41] on Friday we heard firsthand testimony
[2:07:45] of a man in the message that was a
[2:07:47] pastor as a minister the gospel speak
[2:07:50] about of him a breakdown that he had and
[2:07:53] my wife didn't even know hadn't even
[2:07:56] told her I knew myself before
[2:07:59] other ministers that have gone through
[2:08:01] breakdowns and because they're bearing
[2:08:04] your burdens
[2:08:06] we need to be more aware that though our
[2:08:10] soul is in contact with God we still
[2:08:13] have a body in a spirit
[2:08:16] and we need to be more sensitive and
[2:08:20] personal with one another with that we
[2:08:23] don't lose the feeling with one another
[2:08:25] I hope this is OK tonight because
[2:08:28] someone would say all just take us to
[2:08:30] the third pool taking us to the opening
[2:08:32] of the word I'll say this if a person
[2:08:35] has that kind of revelation from the
[2:08:37] word they will have a personal alter
[2:08:40] that produces an alter in their lives
[2:08:44] and if it doesn't something is wrong
[2:08:47] somewhere
[2:08:50] so many years have gone by we've been
[2:08:53] the camp's and services and meetings and
[2:08:55] dynamic preachers it comes down to right
[2:08:58] what I'm Chuck speaking about right now
[2:09:00] there must be a personal individual
[2:09:04] connection with God and when a person
[2:09:08] really has a revelation of this message
[2:09:10] there will be a change in their personal
[2:09:13] lives I'll tell your friends I'm very
[2:09:15] concerned and burdened
[2:09:23] we don't want to ever get putting God in
[2:09:26] our box we want to go to wherever God is
[2:09:29] and get in his box we never want to get
[2:09:32] to the place that we are praying god
[2:09:34] bless my life blessed my you're my
[2:09:37] ministry bless my family bless my wife
[2:09:39] bless my husband - saying prayers get in
[2:09:42] my box we need to go to God's box what
[2:09:46] is your will what is your desire what is
[2:09:48] your direction
[2:09:50] hallelujah
[2:09:52] God's trying to put a big circle around
[2:09:55] you you run you hide you try to get away
[2:09:57] you move out and God's saying where are
[2:09:59] you going
[2:10:02] why do you have that attitude
[2:10:04] that's unsafe out there
[2:10:07] you're running against my will well
[2:10:10] brother John it's it's God's permissive
[2:10:13] will and I'm doing this out of a burden
[2:10:15] friends but if you're not called to do
[2:10:17] that you need to be very careful
[2:10:19] get into God's Way of thinking
[2:10:22] get into God's Way of living our lives I
[2:10:25] say God give us Holy Ghost field lives
[2:10:29] can this church say man - that about
[2:10:32] half of you I
[2:10:34] don't care if you got to go to the barn
[2:10:36] this afternoon
[2:10:39] or miss a meal
[2:10:44] give us born-again experiences
[2:10:51] can we go to that next one thank you
[2:10:56] you've heard the message of what what
[2:10:58] time is it sir serves is this the time
[2:11:00] for the Branham preached it in
[2:11:01] Jeffersonville 1962 then he goes out in
[2:11:06] March here we see 1963 and the seven
[2:11:09] angels appear to him and he said the
[2:11:13] voice said to him turn it sideways and
[2:11:15] he see don't you see it there it was
[2:11:17] Christ the wigged one the judgment he
[2:11:20] was judging a generation but to the
[2:11:23] bride he brought a message so we see now
[2:11:27] in march 17 through the 24th 1963
[2:11:33] God used brother Branham to break the
[2:11:35] seven seals in Jeffersonville
[2:11:37] but how many have forgotten or maybe you
[2:11:41] know that it was on the Monday morning
[2:11:43] after the seventh seal that he spoke on
[2:11:45] Sunday night he spoke twenty more
[2:11:47] minutes that's part of that message he
[2:11:50] actually didn't want them to release the
[2:11:53] Seventh Seal until he listened to it on
[2:11:56] the Monday then he went to a motel
[2:11:59] of the two brothers that had were in
[2:12:01] charge of the making of the tapes and he
[2:12:03] said I don't want this message sent out
[2:12:05] the way that it is and after listening
[2:12:07] to the tape he instructed the brothers
[2:12:10] to stop the tape at a certain point and
[2:12:12] that's in paragraph 261
[2:12:15] then he recorded 20 minutes and then
[2:12:19] they ended the tape again with you can
[2:12:21] hear them singing at the end brother
[2:12:22] branham is the one that wanted it that
[2:12:24] way and they never released that final
[2:12:27] version until after 1966 and brother
[2:12:29] Branham left the scene and you can read
[2:12:31] all this in there seven seals book until
[2:12:35] they released the whole message and on
[2:12:37] that Monday you can hear brother Branham
[2:12:39] speaking this is some of the things that
[2:12:41] he said we are grateful to God for what
[2:12:44] he has showed us I've been sitting in
[2:12:46] the room up there for eight days and the
[2:12:48] message that I have just got through
[2:12:50] explaining to you many here will
[2:12:52] understand I promised that there was
[2:12:54] something going on spiritual all the
[2:12:57] time that I was sure you were missing it
[2:12:59] and here's what it is it's the absolute
[2:13:02] of indication of this interpretation of
[2:13:05] the Scriptures being sin of God this is
[2:13:09] part of the seventh seal brother Branham
[2:13:11] listens to the Sunday night service and
[2:13:14] then he records this said I've been up
[2:13:17] in a room for eight days
[2:13:20] he said I wonder if many of you I'm
[2:13:25] sure you were missing it but here's what
[2:13:27] it is it's the absolute vindication of
[2:13:30] this interpretation of the Scriptures
[2:13:32] being sin of God because before we were
[2:13:35] even went into it I left to go out west
[2:13:37] the Lord showed me a vision one day
[2:13:40] about ten o'clock one morning and I come
[2:13:42] and explained it here that I had seen it
[2:13:44] and didn't know what it was it was a
[2:13:46] constellation of seven angels we'll
[2:13:48] remember that you'll get it on the tape
[2:13:50] called what time as it serves well now
[2:13:53] that is exactly what you're seeing now
[2:13:56] it was Christ coming it was the word
[2:14:00] coming it was him announcing the what
[2:14:03] I've said publicly
[2:14:05] now privately must happen for
[2:14:08] individuals and within a few years he
[2:14:10] was gone off the same is that true
[2:14:12] something publicly was happening but how
[2:14:16] many people wanted a private interview
[2:14:19] with brother Branham all they wait for a
[2:14:22] year I have the quotes here brother
[2:14:24] Branham talked about these things about
[2:14:25] up to a year they wait for a private
[2:14:28] interview if I didn't get a private
[2:14:30] interview as a prophet
[2:14:32] and then in one message he says who here
[2:14:35] would want to have a interview and he
[2:14:38] said so many raised their hand he said
[2:14:40] well who does it
[2:14:42] he said you just get in contact with
[2:14:44] billion just a minute of these time just
[2:14:47] and they would maybe be given 30 minutes
[2:14:49] of time they wanted a private I want
[2:14:53] some personal time with the Prophet I
[2:14:59] think that's the same desired job head
[2:15:02] oh
[2:15:03] if I only knew where he lived I could go
[2:15:05] up to his house and talk to the Lord
[2:15:08] today if I could just go up to his house
[2:15:12] and talk to the Lord and share my
[2:15:14] burdens and really lay it all out there
[2:15:16] and have him talk to me privately and
[2:15:22] we have these burdens and we have these
[2:15:25] things that we go through and where's
[2:15:27] questions
[2:15:29] that people have I
[2:15:34] brought you to the Seventh Seal because
[2:15:36] later in that year in Christ is the
[2:15:38] mystery brother branham refers back to
[2:15:39] it and talks about how the coming of the
[2:15:42] Lord and how it's a mystery it's a
[2:15:44] secret nobody know nothing about it even
[2:15:46] the Angels didn't understand they wanted
[2:15:48] to know when he would come but it's the
[2:15:50] coming of the Lord that's one thing he
[2:15:52] hasn't revealed yet of how he will come
[2:15:54] and when he will come and that's where
[2:15:57] so many get it the Seventh Seal isn't
[2:15:59] open because they say well hey when no
[2:16:01] man knows the day nor hour and they cut
[2:16:03] it off and they say see the Seventh Seal
[2:16:06] isn't open but the bride believes all
[2:16:08] seven seals has been broken do we
[2:16:11] believe that but that's what some have
[2:16:13] gone off here and some have gone they're
[2:16:15] some of when over the years on these
[2:16:18] doctrines and they make great camps
[2:16:21] till finally there would be a generation
[2:16:25] that would say I'm not interested in the
[2:16:27] camps I'm not interested in just to
[2:16:30] church only I want Jesus in my life
[2:16:36] not just a certain preacher oh I've got
[2:16:40] his cell phone number I'll text him now
[2:16:42] whatsapp him I'll send him an email God
[2:16:45] wants you as a person
[2:16:48] how many believe that but how many also
[2:16:52] know that we are to be God with skin on
[2:16:55] him now
[2:16:57] about 5% of you how many know that were
[2:17:00] to be God with skin on
[2:17:03] like the little boy it's raining and my
[2:17:06] wife loves thunder and lightning if you
[2:17:09] want to blame anybody just blame her for
[2:17:11] the weather yesterday and this morning
[2:17:12] because she loves the
[2:17:14] lightning and the Thunder and the rain
[2:17:17] coming down like we had it's our
[2:17:19] vacation so God answered her prayers I
[2:17:22] mean
[2:17:24] give you the desires of your heart
[2:17:31] what was I gonna say there
[2:17:41] but people over the years they they
[2:17:44] thought it was in this and they thought
[2:17:46] it was in that and they thought it was
[2:17:47] in this thank you
[2:17:50] and the little boys
[2:17:52] the mommy said we're believers we're
[2:17:55] Christians you're just going up to your
[2:17:56] bed and go to go to sleep Jesus is with
[2:18:00] us
[2:18:04] but mama sometimes I know those things
[2:18:09] but I want G I want a God with skin on
[2:18:12] him
[2:18:13] come up here mama and sometimes friends
[2:18:17] we need more than just quotes and
[2:18:19] quoting things and pointing somewhere
[2:18:21] else we need to have enough Jesus about
[2:18:24] us to be able to say I've got some wine
[2:18:27] I've got some oil I've got Jesus inside
[2:18:30] of me
[2:18:35] God don't never let us get so cold and
[2:18:38] indifferent
[2:18:41] but what we can still be God with skin
[2:18:43] on and can you imagine coming to church
[2:18:46] and not getting hardly nothing out of it
[2:18:48] but knowing that you're here for someone
[2:18:50] else maybe there's somebody here that
[2:18:53] really needs a personal God and you get
[2:18:55] under a bird and you actually pray and
[2:18:57] seek God God what are you going to do
[2:18:58] and God let you be dry and not receive
[2:19:02] much but somebody else is just soaking
[2:19:04] it in pulling it in I
[2:19:07] prayed God give that person something
[2:19:09] today I know that I've almost been an
[2:19:12] hour and a half that's a long time
[2:19:18] but we'd love for someone to just reach
[2:19:20] out and touch the Lord
[2:19:23] maybe it's a mother maybe it's a husband
[2:19:27] it could be an elder in this church a
[2:19:30] deacon or even a minister
[2:19:33] we can get so busy serving giving
[2:19:37] pouring out being in our positions that
[2:19:42] but we realize I
[2:19:46] need God more in my life I
[2:19:52] would encourage you today find an altar
[2:19:55] somewhere find a personal place
[2:20:01] where you can talk to Jesus
[2:20:04] and Jesus
[2:20:06] can talk back to you I
[2:20:11] believe a person that can I just take a
[2:20:14] couple more minutes a person that really
[2:20:16] knows God in Revelation doesn't become
[2:20:19] all haughty and puffed up I
[2:20:22] believe it doesn't cause you to think
[2:20:25] that you know it all and you're better
[2:20:26] than somebody else in fact quite the
[2:20:29] contrary if you really know Jesus it
[2:20:33] should make you more humble little
[2:20:37] hello I just feel little
[2:20:43] you're finally getting somewhere when
[2:20:45] you feel little
[2:20:47] when you feel like that you're easy to
[2:20:50] be intreated
[2:20:51] and you're approachable where you can go
[2:20:53] and reach to someone that's lower and
[2:20:56] reach out and help them I was in our
[2:20:58] winter camp just a few weeks ago tonight
[2:21:00] I'll speak more about that with our
[2:21:02] young people and I was listening to the
[2:21:04] preaching and I thought here we have a
[2:21:06] Thursday Friday and by Saturday I began
[2:21:09] to think of this do you know what God is
[2:21:11] doing it's like having a plant and
[2:21:14] God is driving down a little stake by
[2:21:18] the plants and then he's getting out
[2:21:20] some little twine or a little rubber or
[2:21:21] something to tie onto that plant
[2:21:24] you don't know what that's like you
[2:21:26] don't have a garden and you plant
[2:21:28] tomatoes and you plant something carrots
[2:21:31] or whatever it is maybe not carrots but
[2:21:33] something else and you put a little
[2:21:35] stake down there well this is real
[2:21:37] spiritual but I'm thinking of this while
[2:21:40] the preachers preaching
[2:21:42] it's called inspiration oh
[2:21:46] thank god what are you doing to our
[2:21:48] young people
[2:21:50] God has the time to labor with us and
[2:21:53] love them and entreat them I thought of
[2:21:58] a little plant steak that you plant hid
[2:22:00] down beside of a plant and put a little
[2:22:02] piece of rope around and tie on to that
[2:22:06] so it can grow straight it's like a
[2:22:09] guide it's like something that I'm here
[2:22:12] to assist you I'm not you and I believe
[2:22:16] one day you're gonna grow stronger and
[2:22:19] when you grow stronger you're not gonna
[2:22:21] need this always around and say what are
[2:22:25] you doing talking like this I'm just
[2:22:28] around
[2:22:30] I'm just here beside of you to guide
[2:22:34] let's go
[2:22:37] you can do this
[2:22:40] say man what are you all screaming what
[2:22:44] are you having all these meetings and
[2:22:46] camps for we're just here to assist you
[2:22:50] we're just here to guide you
[2:22:53] my your instruments are kind of weird
[2:22:56] you're saying it a certain way or
[2:22:58] talking about it in a certain way
[2:23:01] do you know what God's doing he's just
[2:23:04] putting things by your pathway at the
[2:23:07] season of your life to let you know that
[2:23:10] he tears I'm with you
[2:23:15] so stop looking at the things around you
[2:23:18] what are you doing and come on dad come
[2:23:21] on mom no come on preacher
[2:23:26] couldn't you've just said that in 30
[2:23:29] minutes well maybe someone else could
[2:23:32] have
[2:23:33] but God's just putting down a stake next
[2:23:36] to you saying I understand what you're
[2:23:38] going through
[2:23:39] and I'm just here but you're gonna grow
[2:23:41] up one day bright tree you're gonna grow
[2:23:45] up
[2:23:46] don't have a vision God has a plan
[2:23:51] aren't you happy for the guides of your
[2:23:54] life those that are called to be a
[2:23:56] strength Giver
[2:23:59] they're not you they don't think like
[2:24:02] you you're not like them God's made you
[2:24:04] special I
[2:24:09] really feel like that's what we're
[2:24:11] called to do moms dads and elders
[2:24:14] we are here to help and assist and guide
[2:24:17] the believers I think we ought to be
[2:24:20] very careful and cautious I know I am to
[2:24:23] keep damning people to hell just damming
[2:24:27] their souls to hell oh they're not going
[2:24:29] to be saved or they don't even have a
[2:24:30] chance I think we ought to be very
[2:24:32] careful about that do you agree just all
[2:24:34] that church of these people there's no
[2:24:36] chance for that person
[2:24:38] that's not the way God dealt with you
[2:24:42] that's not how he dealt with you older
[2:24:44] ones
[2:24:46] come on have we got so older in the
[2:24:49] message you forgot how stubborn you us
[2:24:52] how hard-headed
[2:24:56] we go so long as a person everything was
[2:25:00] rosy and nice and all we didn't do that
[2:25:02] yes you did
[2:25:04] you were rebellious
[2:25:09] but God rich in mercy look beyond all of
[2:25:13] that and gave you what you have need us
[2:25:17] but we're in another season
[2:25:19] we're in another time
[2:25:22] there's people all around us that need
[2:25:25] help to repair their altars
[2:25:28] repair build up
[2:25:33] God make it more personal help us to
[2:25:38] close the service I don't want it just
[2:25:40] to be someone else was healed and here a
[2:25:43] testimony there's times when you you
[2:25:46] need a healer and you need to say what
[2:25:50] they did for them I need a healer
[2:25:53] where you can say he's my healer
[2:25:58] Amen I'm speaking about a personal
[2:26:01] Savior we're brother Branham said and
[2:26:03] power of transformation you that's out
[2:26:05] on the broadcast I want you to receive
[2:26:07] Christ out there as your personal Savior
[2:26:21] sorry that's the answer of my wife's
[2:26:23] prayers amen I
[2:26:25] even made a plan and a reservation for
[2:26:28] Mexico and I cancelled it we had to be
[2:26:33] standing right here today not on some
[2:26:36] beach all alone with my wife
[2:26:38] I'm called to be standing right here as
[2:26:41] a voice to you
[2:26:44] encouraging you waving you as a person
[2:26:47] to the personal altar I think we can
[2:26:51] look to the person to the right or left
[2:26:52] or look to our families and say what can
[2:26:55] we do to help another person repair
[2:26:58] their altar because I don't want to be a
[2:27:01] here year later five years god forbid 20
[2:27:04] years
[2:27:05] there's a lot of repairing that can go
[2:27:08] on
[2:27:09] Satan has caused great damage
[2:27:12] but I believe we're called together as
[2:27:15] body and as believers to edify one
[2:27:18] another strengthen one another I
[2:27:22] tell you there used to be a time in your
[2:27:24] life when God was dealing with you you
[2:27:27] cried you wept
[2:27:29] you just were so sensitive to God
[2:27:32] the services would come and you would
[2:27:34] just weep and cry and
[2:27:37] you you would just you want to delink
[2:27:41] earth you want it was just like God's
[2:27:43] presence was all around you you'd stay
[2:27:45] sitting in the church till after all
[2:27:47] them musicians had gone people had left
[2:27:50] people's already eaten subways and
[2:27:51] getting ready to go to the evening
[2:27:53] service and you're just still sitting
[2:27:55] there under the impact of the word
[2:27:57] you're just like quivering shaking like
[2:27:59] this you know what that is it's an altar
[2:28:01] God had made a way for you and it wasn't
[2:28:05] a public show
[2:28:06] it was for you
[2:28:08] you just made a mess of things you you
[2:28:11] cried you squall you didn't care about
[2:28:13] your friend and how do I look and am i
[2:28:16] cool-looking can we take a selfie
[2:28:20] goodness you are such an assemble
[2:28:27] I
[2:28:31] know right where I'm standing right now
[2:28:34] there's a need in the message for a
[2:28:36] restoration of the altar
[2:28:39] we've got to the place we just want to
[2:28:41] hear sermons and go out and hear sermons
[2:28:44] and we've gone so long and matured all
[2:28:46] the years that's gone by to where you
[2:28:48] have children growing up and you've got
[2:28:50] grandchildren they need the same
[2:28:51] experience you had daddy and mommy they
[2:28:54] need the same God just as fresh and new
[2:28:58] are we giving them a cracked old formal
[2:29:01] just receive it as you know just receive
[2:29:03] just believe the message
[2:29:06] is that what you're saying to them
[2:29:11] to where they're just going to the rooms
[2:29:14] now they got their iPhone there I enjoy
[2:29:16] the computers or whatever
[2:29:20] Satan has made it so at our fingertips
[2:29:24] of communication yet it's so impersonal
[2:29:29] when God is just the opposite he's
[2:29:32] personal
[2:29:36] where a person says that's my God he's
[2:29:41] my deliverer you say I've got things in
[2:29:44] my life I need a deliverer
[2:29:49] he's my help he's my choice he's my lord
[2:29:54] that's my husband you're talking about
[2:29:57] my prophet
[2:29:59] come on friends we've raised a general
[2:30:02] that's what my daddy believes that's
[2:30:04] what our church how they believe in our
[2:30:06] church
[2:30:07] when it ought to be that's what it says
[2:30:10] in the Bible say but I don't have that
[2:30:13] revelation you can ask God for it you
[2:30:15] can ask God to say God give me that
[2:30:17] revelation
[2:30:20] let's end with this
[2:30:22] brother Branham talked about we have all
[2:30:24] these rooms in our houses in our doors
[2:30:27] and we have a private life and he said
[2:30:30] you'll let God go so far and the Holy
[2:30:33] Ghost go so far but don't get into my
[2:30:36] private life
[2:30:39] that's my private life don't go there
[2:30:43] you can talk about a lot of things but
[2:30:46] don't come into my private life
[2:30:53] brother Branham said you'll never get
[2:30:55] the lordship of Jesus doing that he'll
[2:30:58] just turn right around and walk out the
[2:31:00] door
[2:31:01] said what would you do in the case like
[2:31:04] that if somebody went to a home and they
[2:31:06] said stand here at the door and just
[2:31:08] state your business he said you'd say
[2:31:11] thank you and turn out the door he said
[2:31:14] so would Jesus he said that's the reason
[2:31:17] the church is left sitting cold just the
[2:31:20] way it is he said don't ever let the
[2:31:22] Full Gospel businessmen ever get to that
[2:31:25] stage say what stage are you talking
[2:31:28] about where Jesus can come in so far
[2:31:30] into our music and our church into our
[2:31:34] families but don't get into our private
[2:31:36] life I
[2:31:38] woke up this week listening to a message
[2:31:41] God in simplicity in New Mexico and
[2:31:44] April right after the seals and brother
[2:31:46] branham said the only thing you just
[2:31:48] opened up a little bit and said come on
[2:31:50] inside and stand here but don't go
[2:31:54] around and fool with my private life and
[2:31:57] brother branham said he wants you
[2:32:02] he wants all of you he wants every
[2:32:06] compartment in your heart he wants your
[2:32:09] private life can I say it like this he
[2:32:12] wants your private life he wants all of
[2:32:16] your life he wants to be your Lord
[2:32:19] Lorna's ownership he wants to own you so
[2:32:23] she can guide you and direct you and
[2:32:25] take you and use you are you willing to
[2:32:27] do that if you are he's wanting to come
[2:32:30] in or you wouldn't be standing there so
[2:32:34] now is the hour for you to receive it
[2:32:38] this very hour
[2:32:41] you could receive the personal God it
[2:32:45] could just go into another room can we
[2:32:48] go
[2:32:49] can we go
[2:32:51] I
[2:32:54] enjoy the church that's the kitchen I
[2:32:56] enjoy the parlour but we can talk my is
[2:32:59] so deeper it's been nice knowing you
[2:33:02] but we've come up to another door now
[2:33:07] and that's the bedroom
[2:33:10] that's not for the public
[2:33:13] the kitchen is public the parlour is
[2:33:17] public but the bedroom is the third room
[2:33:20] and I'm encouraging every person in the
[2:33:24] service if you if you're on the outside
[2:33:28] looking in move on into the third room
[2:33:33] who would just raise your hand and say
[2:33:36] by the grace of God I live in that room
[2:33:39] the third room God's revealed that
[2:33:43] what would you say to somebody else
[2:33:45] today that could be in the service or
[2:33:48] after the service that's on the outside
[2:33:51] what are you gonna say to them
[2:33:53] come on in
[2:33:55] but it's not gonna be you and then them
[2:33:59] and you it's gonna be God in them you're
[2:34:02] actually encouraging them to go in there
[2:34:04] that's where people get all red-faced
[2:34:06] they get all ashamed it gets quiet
[2:34:10] but today if you're on the outside
[2:34:13] knowing you need to go in there
[2:34:16] we're encouraging you go all the way
[2:34:19] then can I say you that are in that
[2:34:22] inner room we need to live more from the
[2:34:26] inner room
[2:34:27] we need to live more from that place if
[2:34:30] you're really on the inside looking out
[2:34:33] we need to live from that place more and
[2:34:36] we need to remember that just because
[2:34:39] we're in that third room or the sole
[2:34:41] room does not do away with the other two
[2:34:44] rooms
[2:34:45] we still have a body we still have a
[2:34:47] spirit and our private life will become
[2:34:51] public
[2:34:52] so they say a brother John it doesn't
[2:34:55] matter it doesn't matter my public life
[2:34:57] it's all in my heart it's God knows my
[2:35:00] heart
[2:35:01] he knows your heart but if you have him
[2:35:04] privately it'll become public that goes
[2:35:08] for the positive and it goes for the
[2:35:10] negative
[2:35:11] if there's movies and extreme sport
[2:35:15] things and you're just over and I've got
[2:35:17] those things in my notes because I know
[2:35:19] what I'm talking about wrong music
[2:35:22] things going on privately in your life
[2:35:25] say nobody knows and
[2:35:27] there will come a time it becomes public
[2:35:31] so the best time to deal with it is
[2:35:34] right now and say God come into my
[2:35:37] personal life
[2:35:39] do we all agree you say brother I've got
[2:35:43] everybody hoodwinked nobody knows and
[2:35:45] you might you might be right
[2:35:48] but you don't realize it's coming out in
[2:35:51] your attitude it's coming out in your
[2:35:52] words what is private becomes public so
[2:35:56] I think it's a good time to be honest
[2:35:57] and say god I want to repair the
[2:36:01] personal part of my life and it's not
[2:36:05] everybody else
[2:36:07] it's me I need prayer I
[2:36:11] need to get more with God brother I'll
[2:36:15] just want to be honest with you I could
[2:36:18] be closer to Jesus and if everyone
[2:36:22] started moving in that direction it
[2:36:24] would stop a lot of nonsense
[2:36:26] it would stop a lot of things that go on
[2:36:29] that causes so much trouble if all of us
[2:36:33] just kept pulling and tonight we're
[2:36:35] going to go into that the oil and the
[2:36:36] wine
[2:36:38] hurt not the oil in the wine can take
[2:36:42] their health you can take the wealth you
[2:36:44] can take their friends but you can't
[2:36:46] take the Holy Ghost and you can't take
[2:36:48] it when they're stimulated by the word
[2:36:51] as we bow our heads right now
[2:36:56] be it unto me Lord according to your
[2:36:59] word
[2:37:00] Lord I might be in the crowd I might be
[2:37:04] in the church
[2:37:09] but it's when I can gather myself and be
[2:37:12] honest with the Lord Jesus
[2:37:15] and I can talk personal I
[2:37:19] can talk privately with the Lord
[2:37:23] those are very valuable moments
[2:37:26] those are very sacred sands
[2:37:31] those are experiences that we need more
[2:37:34] of
[2:37:34] in the message and in our churches and
[2:37:37] in our family altars
[2:37:40] we need more family altars
[2:37:43] we need more marriage altars where men
[2:37:46] and women humble themselves to the
[2:37:48] scripture - just a few minutes of a
[2:37:50] message my wife and I do it we've gone
[2:37:53] through messages the Hebrews book the
[2:37:55] adoption series the seven seals were in
[2:37:57] again now
[2:37:59] we don't listen to an hour two hours
[2:38:02] it's maybe 15 minutes here 20 minutes
[2:38:04] there we might go 30 or 35
[2:38:08] it's time together
[2:38:10] it's a time in the word we're not
[2:38:14] watching a movie together we're not
[2:38:15] running around me it's time to turn off
[2:38:18] your phone it's a time to not answer the
[2:38:21] call
[2:38:23] that's calling you from there and there
[2:38:26] it's a time to just get alone in your
[2:38:28] marriage and say we need a marriage
[2:38:31] altar we need a family altar
[2:38:36] even in the church as I found as the
[2:38:38] years gone by it's almost like the altar
[2:38:41] has become a shun place to go it's
[2:38:43] almost like a stigma it's like I said
[2:38:46] earlier that's why I said it
[2:38:49] we need to stop thinking that just
[2:38:51] because someone goes to the altar that
[2:38:53] their back slid sometimes they just want
[2:38:56] to get out of the normal and get out of
[2:38:58] the average and say god I just want a
[2:39:01] time of prayer
[2:39:04] maybe do some of your good tonight
[2:39:06] before the meeting just maybe you're so
[2:39:09] much in a rut you just do it a certain
[2:39:12] way but you like to slip out and come
[2:39:14] forward and this where maybe five
[2:39:16] minutes or 10 minutes you know that's
[2:39:18] brother Daniel cross that's already
[2:39:21] going to the airport now could have that
[2:39:23] kind of a memory about his daddy
[2:39:27] I wonder what kind of memories were
[2:39:29] given our children I
[2:39:31] wonder what kind of things were sending
[2:39:33] to our wives and what we're listening to
[2:39:35] with our wives
[2:39:37] some of us just need to stop the
[2:39:39] nonsense and the fussing and say we need
[2:39:42] more of Jesus
[2:39:46] sister you can play something I believe
[2:39:49] in the gifts here in this church that
[2:39:51] God lays something on your heart I
[2:39:52] believe it's good
[2:39:55] how many would just say God I'm making
[2:39:57] my way to my personal altar I'm walking
[2:40:02] I'm lifting up a stone I'm lifting up
[2:40:05] this piece of wood here
[2:40:08] god bless you
[2:40:13] maybe some are guilty of being in the
[2:40:16] false gods of bail and there's too much
[2:40:18] false things in your life you needed to
[2:40:20] say brother John I need help taking down
[2:40:22] this certain thing this thing over here
[2:40:24] I need the Lord to consume it and burn
[2:40:26] it up I
[2:40:29] realize I'm so far down the road with
[2:40:31] this attitude and feeling it's not right
[2:40:35] why don't you lay that up on the altar
[2:40:38] brother
[2:40:38] [Music]
[2:40:42] sister what's it going to take for us to
[2:40:45] realize
[2:40:48] we need those old-fashioned times again
[2:40:54] you might think it's juvenile but when
[2:40:57] brother Jon heard those voices the other
[2:40:59] day of those men and women crying out
[2:41:02] calling out their last recorded words I
[2:41:05] was so smitten I began to weep I felt
[2:41:10] right on my knees in my office I said Oh
[2:41:13] God
[2:41:16] that's when you're not focused on
[2:41:18] somebody else's sins or their little
[2:41:20] hind their parts it's like God help me
[2:41:24] and I'm just getting ready to go in
[2:41:26] front of hundreds of your people help us
[2:41:30] not knowing in a few minutes that would
[2:41:33] be a man in our own
[2:41:35] area
[2:41:38] that within minutes was going to be
[2:41:40] speaking to his wife for the last time
[2:41:43] and he was going to be gone I thought
[2:41:47] God help us Lord as I the news came to
[2:41:49] me within hours god help us
[2:41:54] I
[2:41:56] want my last words to be a mercy and
[2:41:59] grace I love my last sermon to be one
[2:42:03] where someone was sensitive to God in
[2:42:06] that meeting
[2:42:08] to make footsteps to a personal place
[2:42:12] wouldn't you like that for yourself
[2:42:14] [Music]
[2:42:18] don't you want to be that kind of
[2:42:20] believer the people want what you've got
[2:42:28] maybe you've been guilty of handing them
[2:42:31] a drug or a smoke or a filthy magazine
[2:42:34] or maybe you're guilty of texting
[2:42:36] gossiper being a person that's
[2:42:40] and you're just so embarrassed you just
[2:42:43] feel like wiping everything clean and
[2:42:45] starting all over just deleting this
[2:42:47] account deleting that shooting that CD
[2:42:50] empty in that
[2:42:52] maybe you need to do that
[2:42:57] maybe somebody needs to say I've been
[2:42:59] sorry and I'm if I've offended you if
[2:43:02] I've hurt you in any way I'm sorry
[2:43:08] there were people that were called to
[2:43:11] move out the rocks and the logs and on
[2:43:15] the way to the cities of refuge that was
[2:43:19] the calling was to move out logs and
[2:43:21] rocks so that people could run to the
[2:43:23] city of refuge so that the way was more
[2:43:25] plain for them
[2:43:28] not complex and difficult but just
[2:43:32] saying Lord Jesus if I could move a rock
[2:43:34] for somebody brother over there can I
[2:43:37] help you move that log
[2:43:40] that beam little mode in our eyes that
[2:43:44] we can't see around
[2:43:46] but maybe Elijah said God there's seven
[2:43:50] thousand people there's other people
[2:43:53] around me that are designed the same
[2:43:55] thing I thought I was the only person I
[2:43:59] thought I was the only one that felt
[2:44:01] this way and God opened your eyes and
[2:44:03] says you know what all the believers
[2:44:05] around you are like that
[2:44:09] Lord are you making away this this
[2:44:12] service for a personal God because maybe
[2:44:16] in the next few days maybe in a couple
[2:44:18] weeks God wants to use this assembly in
[2:44:21] another dynamic
[2:44:23] chapter
[2:44:25] to move out the logs and move out the
[2:44:28] rocks but before you can help somebody
[2:44:30] else it's got to be moved out of your
[2:44:32] own
[2:44:35] you've got to have a personal experience
[2:44:38] before you can help someone else
[2:44:41] lead them to the door
[2:44:44] lead them to the bedroom and say come on
[2:44:47] in brother come on sister go into that
[2:44:50] place
[2:44:51] Jesus is beckoning to you come on into
[2:44:55] this secret place it's not a public show
[2:44:59] it's not for everybody else it's for you
[2:45:01] and you alone and God
[2:45:03] Heavenly Father
[2:45:04] [Music]

[2:45:10] addresses come to our holes come to our
[2:45:13] marriages

[2:45:31] place from another round we're able to
[2:45:34] connect through and we have a love for
[2:45:36] them
[2:45:37] but how so much greater the love of God
[2:45:41] for all of us to bring us in to encircle
[2:45:45] us into his great economy and say Oh for
[2:45:49] a personal place a private life

[2:46:23] exterior all the stuff and just be real
[2:46:28] with one another
[2:46:30] [Music]
[2:46:34] help us to be willing to say if I've
[2:46:36] been wrong I want the Lord to show me
[2:46:41] helped us to be willing to say to
[2:46:43] someone else if I ever hurt you or
[2:46:46] offended you I need to be more sensitive
[2:46:52] to me Lord that really shows that a
[2:46:55] person's got something deep
[2:47:00] help our ministers help our musicians
[2:47:03] help our deacons in our trustees
[2:47:06] hope the Gator Patrol helped the
[2:47:09] counselors help the elders help the ones
[2:47:12] that have given up all of their Sunday's
[2:47:14] for the last 30 years 32 years their
[2:47:18] Easter Sunday
[2:47:21] and now this year we have it so many
[2:47:25] want to come that within days it's
[2:47:27] already booked up in a waiting list
[2:47:29] can I come can I still come even up
[2:47:32] there yesterday hearing can I come can I
[2:47:35] come and the answer back was you're
[2:47:37] gonna have to let us know by tonight
[2:47:38] Lord Jesus
[2:47:44] have you made it so good for us and so
[2:47:47] easy for us
[2:47:49] that we've missed Jesus in all of it
[2:47:57] to be continued
[2:48:01] we go out in a few minutes get a little
[2:48:04] refreshment and come back let us hear
[2:48:06] more about this oil in this wine a few
[2:48:08] Divis an afternoon service
[2:48:12] bring the atmosphere goddess
[2:48:15] expectancy bring us to a place Lord
[2:48:17] where
[2:48:18] you can be more personal and we can be
[2:48:21] more personal to one another Jesus I
[2:48:24] asked you
[2:48:28] may there be not one person in this
[2:48:31] whole area in this church
[2:48:34] in this community and our families that
[2:48:37] do not see Jesus enough in our lives
[2:48:39] that on the day of judgment they look
[2:48:42] back across the bar and say why didn't
[2:48:44] you tell us what you could have been
[2:48:46] more real to us
[2:48:51] because today is the day to give our
[2:48:54] mercy and grace I
[2:48:56] know then we'll want to give it we'll
[2:48:59] want to say Lord Jesus get
[2:49:03] can't you just bring them in can't you
[2:49:05] allow them can't you
[2:49:09] you need a cup of cold water do you need
[2:49:11] a little way do you what can we do
[2:49:15] if it's teaching we'll have a little
[2:49:17] teaching if it's an altar service let's
[2:49:19] have an altar service if it's a prayer
[2:49:22] line if it's a counselor just talking to
[2:49:24] a little girl that's off on the
[2:49:26] sidelines or a young man that seems a
[2:49:28] little distant
[2:49:30] if it's a brother that's in the church
[2:49:33] might seem like an elder but little do
[2:49:35] we know there's things going on in his
[2:49:37] life maybe it's a sister that's the
[2:49:39] choir director
[2:49:40] maybe it's a deacons wife or someone
[2:49:43] that's 3040 years
[2:49:45] she's just on them she's just a thread
[2:49:50] away
[2:49:50] from losing her mind
[2:49:55] God
[2:49:57] don't let us become so callous and so
[2:50:01] far away with one another that we don't
[2:50:04] pick up on the little indicators
[2:50:07] someone right next to us is calling out
[2:50:11] for help
[2:50:17] what Jesus
[2:50:19] put on skin with somebody around me that
[2:50:23] I could answer my question
[2:50:28] what maybe we could pray like this this
[2:50:30] afternoon Lord if you could use us to
[2:50:34] influence another person closer to you
[2:50:38] it would really help me in my walk with
[2:50:41] you to see that my life has reason and
[2:50:44] purpose
[2:50:47] it might be somebody right in our own
[2:50:50] home or somebody on that chat group or
[2:50:53] somebody in the Pew you might not have
[2:50:55] to look very far for God to answer your
[2:50:58] prayer
[2:50:58] [Music]
[2:51:00] might just have to look in the mirror
[2:51:02] say Jesus
[2:51:05] let me look beyond
[2:51:08] the facade and the
[2:51:11] mechanical devices
[2:51:14] and the building and the badge are
[2:51:17] skinned I
[2:51:19] want to go into that private place I
[2:51:24] want to go into that place
[2:51:27] secret place where
[2:51:30] you can make it known to me personally
[2:51:34] my eyes can come open I can say Oh
[2:51:38] Stan Jesus did was you seeing it that
[2:51:42] way all the time I'm so sorry I hurt you
[2:51:48] I've been living these last months and
[2:51:52] years so selfish what can I do for
[2:51:55] somebody else can I do something
[2:51:58] Oh God
[2:52:00] forgive us Lord Jesus if we've been like
[2:52:04] that Balaam's mule we've been so
[2:52:06] stubborn and Balaam was just hitting and
[2:52:09] hitting and hitting
[2:52:12] it would be so stubborn artists

[2:52:19] even have a soul has to talk to us and

[2:52:37] years

[2:52:57] rushing it
