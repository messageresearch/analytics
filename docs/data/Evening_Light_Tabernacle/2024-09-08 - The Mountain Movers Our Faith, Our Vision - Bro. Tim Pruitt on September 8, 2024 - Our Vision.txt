because it was on that day you rose from the dead and and and then here we are to honor your resurrection and to remember oh God you gave your life in your life abundantly for us that we oh God could walk in the freedom of the spirit of God now Lord I pray as we open up the pages of the Bible that you'll just Reveal Your word to us and make it real we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen praise God God bless you amen we love every one of you and so appreciate you thank you amen if you'll turn with me to Revelation chapter 9 I'm going to I'm going to read from this book of symbols that is something that has uh been left for the end time prophesied um and written even after the Apostle Paul had left the scene and uh here John it's a revelation of the end time and what God would do in the end time and some of it most of it was written in in shrouded in symbols because God made it that way that it would not be made known until the evening light so these many things would be obscure and and clouded and darkened and and um being as as we say in dark words and symbolic forms or Shadows or um Jesus would many times speak in Parables that they wouldn't understand they wouldn't get the meaning of but he said it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom and here we are in the last day to see the Fulfillment of the word of God and how precious it is to us Revelation 9 verse1 and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from Heaven unto the Earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit so here is the fall of of a of an Angel and to him was given a key or permission to open up the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and There Rose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by the reason of the smoke of the pit so it brings a great darkness and there came out of the smoke focused upon the Earth and unto them were given power as the Scorpions of the Earth have power and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men who have not the Seal of God in their foreheads and to them it was given that they should not kill them but they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion and when he striketh a man and in those days shall man seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and Death Shall flee from them and the shape of the Locust were liken the horses prepared un battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as faces of men and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as teeth of lions and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as a sound of Chariots of many horses running to battle and they had tails liken to scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt in 5 months and they had a king over them which is the Angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is aaden but in the Greek tongue his name is apolon one woe is passed behold there come two woes more Hereafter and the sixth Angels sounded and I Heard a Voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth Angels which had the trumpet loose the Four Angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates and the Four Angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were 200,000,000 and I heard the number of them and thus I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and Jason and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone by these men or by these three were was the third part of men killed by the fire by the Smoke by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were likened to serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and Idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices amen may God bless you can you can be seated today I'm going to be speaking onto you about our faith our vision and here we have read of a vision of the end time and in this we see the coming of two angels that are that come into this Dimension and uh in in Revelation 11 or chapter 9 and 11 they had a one of them had a king over them this great host of demonic Powers had a King over them which is the Angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is aaden but in the Greek tongue his name is aolon and from his Abyss that he is a king over comes a blinding delusion a smoke that permeates everything and it permeates every crack every crevice of humanity and every fabric of society and it comes to Cloud the vision for to keep men from seeing the light of truth if you notice it it this smoke would would blind or or darken the Sun and block out the light but then we see um also coming after that or in the same time period of a um in Revelation 10:1 the coming of the mighty Angel and only Christ this could be he is the light for his face is as it were the son he is the Angel of the Covenant for he is clothed with a rainbow he comes um as the light for his face is as it were the Sun and he comes with truth for as he shouts are the Bible uses the word Christ there are voices of Thunders that are heard mysteries of God which will re which will reveal and open up the contents of the book and of course every human being today is influenced by one of these angels either the Destroyer the king of the Abyss which is Lord over your life or the mighty Angel which is Christ the lord and this Mighty angel of course we see him holding back the powers of Darkness there is his feet is upon the land and upon the sea from where in Revelation 13 if we would read that it would tell us of a great Beast that rose out of the sea and another rose out of the land and so here in Revelation 10 it shows that he has his feet which means possession holding down the very powers of hell and these beasts that are rising up that are that are to be spirits in the end time that brings about the um the mark of the beast and the end time process and so he he comes there to deceive those whose names are written are not written in the Book of Life notice this those those names that are written in the Lamb's Book of Life they are taken from the earth they are in a great planned Escape because you see Jesus said we we should always pray pray always to escape the things that are coming on this Earth and to be accounted worthy to stand before the son of man so you see it is a plan Escape that God has a Rapture of his church where Christ will take his bride amen where he will rescue her from the powers of Darkness as hell will establish itself upon the Earth and Satan will be given a short SE season of complete Dominion you will see this in Revelation 12 again we couldn't read all of this in our open and reading but the the study of all of this was show even Revelation 12 and 12 of the response when the saints are are been gathered into heaven it says therefore Rejoice your heavens and you that dwell in them and woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down to you having great Wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time so you see those who will miss the Rapture those who are Sanctified but not spirit filled they they will go through the Great Tribulation they will they will be left behind when the Rapture takes place because the Rapture is only for those who have the token that is the literal life of Jesus Christ the holy spirit amen now and of course you can see this again it's it's spelled out in the Bible what will happen in Revelation 12:17 said the dragon was wro with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ so these are people who have a testimony of Jesus Christ and he goes to make war with them and and of course he will overcome them because the Bible said in Revelation 13 and verse 7 it was given power unto him to make war with the Saints and to to overcome them and power was given un him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so here again we we see Bible prophecy coming down of of um of of great things as God delivers his people the bride and he also will deliver his people isra Israel there's 144,000 elect that will not be deceived and that will will once again recognize him them him whom they have pierced and the Bible tells you in Revelation 123 of this preparation for he said when the dragon saw he was he was cast in the earth he persecuted the woman Israel which had brought forth the Manchild Jesus Christ and to the woman was given two wings of a great Eagle we can see this in the Bible in Revelation 11 there were two witnesses given which which represents Elijah and Moses the law and the prophets and in other words a complete word of God for the Jewish people and and here they will come and reveal to them their Messiah and so they're given two wings of a great Eagle that she might fly into the Wilderness into replace where she is nourished for a time and a times and a half times as a time one year times two years and a half times three and a half years from the face of the serpent so God has a provision sir he has a provision for us that's an escape amen he has a provision for even the foolish virgins who will give their life in the tribulation will wind up at the white Throne judgment and be judged according to the Deeds Done in their body he has a provision for the Jewish people and so you see for them he will send the you know again give to her the wings of an of of an eagle two wings of a great Eagle to fly into her place where she will be cared for or nourished and protected and given and and given life we will see her in she'll be part of the Great Millennial Reign ahead as the servants to the bride of Christ but now when we look at at the land of Israel we see a nation that has been attacked on every side and all of this is in the vision now this this is what I'm trying to focus on today is the vision and then our faith as we as we see our faith is the it gives us the ability to to see the vision as the vision is manifested so you if you look there in the land of Israel and what is even happening today it's all in the vision the Bible said in Zechariah 12:1 the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel sayeth the Lord which stretches forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and forth the spirit of man within him behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling into all people round about when they shall be in the seeds both against Judah that's the Jews and against Jerusalem and in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people and all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it so this is what the vision says the vision says Israel will be the burdensome Stone of all the nations amen now this is a spiritual battle and it is War I want you to understand that and the Warfare even with with Israel is more than a natural battle it is a spiritual battle and and the Warfare is on every side it comes from Iran from Hezbollah from Hamas the pales iians from all the Arab Nations and and and in our country as well where public sentiment is against them and riots have been in the streets and here in the United States the world opinion is against Israel Israel is being attacked as though they were the aggressors they there's so many of fronts with this war even with the turmoil uh within the Israeli Israeli people they're rioting in the streets they're screaming to free the hostages as if Israel is the one that can do this you see Israel doesn't have the hostages amen they don't have the hostages their their governor is not one to holding them a hostage it is the enemy out here and they're writing against their own government because they're so blinded against or by the smoke of the ill usion and and remember you can watch Israel and watch he is physically and realize that we are her counterpart so then therefore you know whatever she is naturally we are spiritually actually when you read the scripture in Joel chapter 2 it is speaking of about Israel naturally when he says I will restore unto you all the years of the cankerworm the borm the cus and the caterpillar but you see it was Peter on the day of Pentecost that took and applied that spiritually and said this is that because he could see the spiritual application of what what was a natural promise amen now so again again it was it spoken to Israel as a nation but to the bride also because she is spiritual Israel we are her spiritual counterpart and she has been gathered from the Nations back to her Homeland and even so God is gathering his bride from the denominations back to the homeland of the Bible this is what God is doing now in the midst of all of this there is the mystery of iniquity that is at work now remember God has his mystery and and Satan also is coming under his guys and and and here under his cover of smoke in darkness here he's working you know working among the the people in the world today and then the book of Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse one Paul would talk about the coming of the Lord and he said we beseech you brother by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ by gathering together to him that you be soon not shaken or betrayed troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition that's right amen so notice Paul has this Vision this is his insight and they were looking for the come of the Lord and Paul said now listen don't be shaken by what they're saying for the coming cannot happen until there's a fallen away first so they were looking and expecting the Lord Jesus they had seen him go away he had said I'm coming again in like manner the as you have seen me go away I will come again they had watched him depart and clouds received him out of their sight and so you know they were looking for his return and and and and there were even things that they were saying you know ideas among the people of that for example because that Jesus had said about John you know um uh and Peter cuz he he spoke to Peter and said you know one day he said when you're when you're old they're going to lead you to places that you don't want to go you're this is the way you're going to die and he and he said well what what have come of this man and he spoke unto about John and he said it's it's not for you to know that what did what if what would it be what what would it be if he just lived till I come so there went for the saying that went forth the saying ah John's still here that's right so we know then if John's still here the Lord is still coming he hadn't come yet and so there went abroad this saying but as John corrected it he said he said he didn't say I would be here when he come he said what is it to the if I live till he comes that's right so John tried to correct those sayings you know but people were anxious about to come to the Lord and I think as as we come toward the end the more anxious we get that's right you know we we're wanting to see we want to pry back the curtain as it was or you know take a peek into the future you know uh some understand what is about to happen what is going to take place and and so you know again we we want today to to look into the vision of God's word and try to get an understanding now when Paul Paul knew of course the church would have first before his coming he said now according to my vision according to what God showed me are you with me the vision uh he's going he's not coming back until there's a big falling away and and then in verse five he said remember ye not when I was yet with you I told you these things so there were things he was telling them you know maybe even things that aren't even recorded in the scripture that he had told them before but he had told them been talking to them and he said I told you these things and and of course he did to the Corinthians in 2 Corinthians 11:1 he says I'm jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I've espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ but I fear what I'm afraid of lest by any means and he looks back at the prophecy he looks back at what happened in Eden and he says as a serpent begal leave through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ so you see he sees her and he's afraid she is going to give her womb to another and become polluted and and become a fallen woman we're talking about the church now amen because the woman represents the church the man represents Christ and God will use this he will use this in Ephesians 5 and he he says husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church gave himself for and and that's what a man is to do he is to love his wife and give himself amen he's to give himself for her for his children he's not to live for himself amen he's not he's not out to to take his his own vices and gamble away his money and spend his money on alcohol and tobacco and all this other stuff but he's to nurture and love and to take care of his wife and that's what Christ is to do and any man that is not doing that is a fallen man he is not in the image of Christ that is a fallen man but but again he said I'm here Paul would say I'm jealous I I'm worried about you I'm I'm I am jealous over you for his sake because you're going to be like Eve you're going to give your womb to another and there'll be a Life come out of there that will not be PR producing The Life of Christ now John also sees the vision and sees the church as a fallen woman he sees her and the Bible calls her John calls her a a woman who has lost her virtue a woman who has given her herself to receive the seed of another now I I want to just get this with you because christum as we know it today has fallen she is a fallen woman described in the Bible as a and her daughters that came out of her which would be the Protestant system is is Fallen with her that's right they're called harlets they took on the nature and emulated the life of their mother so in Revelation 171 one of the Angels Came one of the angels to me which had the seven viles and talk with me saying come hither I will show you the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters now these are symbolic things when you see many Waters like this is multitudes and Nations and tongues and people and so when you understand the symbology of it then you you will be able to read it as you see and you see well he said she sets upon many Waters in other words she rules over many nations upon multitudes of people right about four billion in our life today the the world today is what Rome rules over and and he says again he said um uh and he said with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication now watch they they have committed fornication which is a which is a a sex act of of not being married it's an adultery and the inhabitants of the world have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication and this is true all the way back from 325 ad when they begin to organize the the first Catholic Church raising it up and they become drunk on the wine of their fornication and they're formulated a trinity Doctrine and a trinity of gods and a Rome baptism and infant baptism and all other kinds of things and the worship of Saints and the worship of Mary amen and all kinds of things that they incorporated into that until today the world is drunk again she is the biggest cult in the world let me just say it clear she's the biggest cult in the world you say oh brother Tim I'm telling you what you you people you follow a prophet you're a cult well what about this that follows one man a pope 4 billion three3 to four a billion people and they owe their allegiance to him they have killed in his name murdered throughout the years she's a murderer and Wicked at heart amen now I know she's being pro promoted today as being you know the holy mother the conservative one the one with virtues and and she looks good compared to the far left but let me tell you she is Wicked at heart it's been proven all the way down when she when she's in power she rules ruthlessly she kills she murders she she ravishes she ruins she wrecks now now again again her daughters have been as guilty of some of the same thing and but I want to get this to you because Paul said when he said this about this woman and he the church he said I'm afraid I I I'm jealous over you that you're going to do what mother Eve did and watch now in verse four of chapter 11 2 Corinthians 11:4 for if he preacheth another Jesus notice this Paul would come along and he says actually what what's going to happen is there will be another one another Jesus one who we didn't preach come on right and and another Spirit which is not the Holy Spirit which you have not received or another gospel so Paul said it's another spirit it's another gospel it's another Jesus that's right now it's all all calling the name of Jesus but the worship is not the Jesus Paul preached that's why there needed come a restoration in this day to restore us back to the gospel Paul preached and introduce us to the Jesus that Paul preached because the Jesus let me let me explain to you let me just take a minute here you see what they did the theologians of Rome they took Jesus the one and they made him into a Catholic Jesus one that Minds his mama that you don't even pray to him you pray to Mary and she will pray to Jesus who will get the angry father to change his mind about killing you exactly you know there there again she will take him and cut him into three and make three deities out of him which is idolatry and then she will turn around and she she will make listen a Baptist Jesus will take Jesus Jesus he don't care about what you look like how you dress how you act just as long as you say I believe in the Jesus you make your confession of Faith you can still go to your dances you can still go to your your beard parties you can still go do your other things because this Jesus doesn't care this Jesus is going to save you no matter what you do and once that you said I believe you're always saved no matter how you live amen MH now so Paul would would bring this out and we go back to 2 Thessalonians and he says now he talks about this one that would oppose and exalt himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sits in the temple of God showing himself that he is God Amen now that's 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and and what's now in verse four we were reading I want you to put it up where they can see it so he opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God amen amen exalts himself above the Holy Apostles what the Bible says you can't find one place in the entire Bible where anybody was ever baptized in titles they were ever bapt all baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen but they oppose that and exalt themselves above that or that is worshiped all that is called God so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he's is God so another Jesus will sit in the church that's right and he will be worshiped and he'll be worshiped by millions amen and he said now you know what withholdeth verse 6 that he might be revealed in his time so there would be actually a time where he would be under such disguise but in the last day when when the light comes for it says in Zechariah 14:7 that when in the evening time it shall be light yes and it makes it clear also that this mighty one coming down in Revelation 10 his face is as it were the Sun and there's somebody going to hear his voice amen there's somebody somewhere or some seed somewhere that his light will penetrate through the darkness of the age that's right yeah and we'll recognize the truth that's right and recognize things for what they are yeah now so you see you and you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time and for the mystery of iniquity here's where it is Mystery of iniquity it's already working you know Paul John would say Brethren the Antichrist is Among Us he would start out in that first age we don't have time to get into the seals but in the first seal he would come out and on a white horse looking like Christ going forth to conquer and it was that Antichrist Spirit but it looked like Jesus that's right amen now as you look at it here it comes a mystery of iniquity already working only he who leth will let that's the Holy Spirit until he be taken away do you know the holy spirit is lifting from the world that we're living in do you know it's lifting from the Fab of society do you know it's lifting from the homes and the and our our government our everything that we we have that once was once held true to to some semblance of of truth that's right and here again the here you go again the it's lifting and I want to give something to you when it lifts there's a people going with him amen so as he is as he is being pulled out or lifted out of there there's another people that is being lifted with him that's right you see we're not part of the Fallen World we are part of the world of the people that will rise we're part of the resurrection and then he said when he is taken out the way then shall that Wicked one be revealed here's when he'll be manifest whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and destroy him with the brightness of his coming of course that's Armageddon even his whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lion wonders and with all deceivableness of of unrighteousness in them that perish what because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved brother you've got to be a truth lover in this day that's who I'm preaching today today I'm convinced I'm preaching to people who want truth might hurt sometimes amen it might go against your thinking sometimes it might go against the society and what is being promoted out there amen but you want truth give me truth Lord amen but he says and for this cause because they don't have a love for the truth God shall send them a strong delusion which we read in Revelation chapter n the opening of the bottomless pit that they might believe a lie that they should all be damned who had not believed the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness so in the Book of Revelation chapter 9 there are these Spirits Bound in Euphrates that are released in this last day it's a it's an army it's an army it comes to reinforce the Demonic realm with 200 million Supernatural Devils here they come out of the Abyss so that the last age faces more opposition than any other age even the age is of persecution that's right even the ages of the great horrible Trials of the Dark Ages and this last age will will actually face the supernatural influx of demonic powers that will come against the people of God and will bring a strong delusion in the world that you're living in until they will grope into a insanity and the Bible said and I saw the horses and the Visions who those who setled them breastplates of fiery red and hent blue and sulfur yellow and the heads of them were like heads of lion out of their mouth came fire and smoke and brimstone it was spiritual horses these are not natural creatures did you ever see a horse like this no these are not natural these are things that that are are coming out of the pit and they're spiritual Devils or Chargers that has been bound in the Euphrates all these years Supernatural Devils that's what they are and some of them have the shape of locusts like horses prepared for battle and on their heads are crowns of of something like gold their faces were like faces of men they had hair like women's hair and their their teeth were like lion's teeth they had breastplates like breastplates of iron sound of their wings was like sounded chariots with many horses running to battles and the Tails had like scorpions and there were stings in their tails and they torment men and I want you to understand this is mentally spirits of insanity striking the people people notice it's also physical because the Bible said they'll kill a third part of men and and and let me just remind you that you know here again A lot of times when the Bible is speaking he's speaking to the Jewish people as well in instead of the whole world and so he will speak in kind of in a personal we but let me just say they killed a third part of men and during the Holocaust did you know there was a third part of the world's Jewish population wiped out now why why the river Euphrates what does that have to do with it the Euphrates River was a key factor for developing in developing early civilizations like the Babylonian Assyrian Empires and you know it was a home to many of the ancient cities that were once major centers of civilization including her which Abraham came from Babylon and Nineveh and Euphrates it was one of the four rivers that flow from the Garden of Eden in Genesis 15 and verse 18 it mentions the Euphrates as one of the boundaries of the land God promised to Abraham so I want you to understand they are not in the promised land but they are on the other side and they're bound and not able to get in because the Euphrates is a boundary that they cannot cross so on one side is the river of the river is are the Heathen condition that Abraham left a multiple deities and and idol worship it also on that other side is back the place of confusion amen where where is ARS where is where is knowledge where where his uh uh deities and multo deities and and idol worship there would would would come it would be the nation that would come and destroy Israel and take them captive and remove them from the from the promised land to Babylon and let me just say on the other counterpart remember that that's exactly what had happened with the with the the people of God the Gentile Church they were taken captive that's right and they were hauled to Babylon yeah and every one of them things out there is a Babylonian system yeah and that's why that in this day there has been a call to go back to the homeland of the Bible back to what Paul preached right because the rest of them are in Babylon and yeah there were real Jews in Babylon there was Daniel in Babylon there was there was Ezekiel in Babylon and there was Luther in Babylon and there was Wesley in Babylon somebody with me but in this day there's been a return to restore us back to our ancestral homeland of Peter Paul James and John the land of Jesus somebody with me and to restore us back Amen to worshiping unto the one true name of God Amen which is Jesus Christ Jehovah [Applause] Savior and bring us back to that original place of worship again which is in Christ that's right now on the other side of the river Riv lays B one side of the River lays Babylon the other side of the River lays the land of promise let me just tell you the little bitty piece that Israel owns of that land ain't near what God promised Abraham it would go all the way to the river Euphrates and let me but on the other side of the river is lay a land of promise wherever promise of the Bible I want to just say it where even promises we have not yet fully possessed lay because there are still promises there like the Resurrection the change of our body the Rapture now these Spirits Bound in EES were prevented from going into the land and it was something that bound them but now they're loosed in the the last day and and they bring a physical persecution against the Jews and and it drives them back into their Promised Land but it don't end there it's just constantly there trying to keep them from possessing what God promised them right and I I want you to understand you know something that bound them but they're loosing this last day and I and I want you to see even naturally we are in the vision that's [Music] right now the end is upon us and I want you to understand as well that those same evil spirits that are against the Jews possessing all that belongs to them is against us the bride of Christ from possessing everything that belongs to us he'll use every method as he can even like he's doing stirring up the own Jewish people you know to against to to you know to to to try to make a peace to try to make a peace which they know will not last which they know they just rearmed themselves again and that Philadelphia Corridor there is seven miles but on the border of Israel and and Egypt Egypt had promised to be in a treaty and at peace with with Israel and they have dug thousands hundreds if not thousands of of big tunnels under there and shuffling in arms and weaponry and everything and even during this time of resupplying Hamas uh you know with with arms and everything else because their hatred I I want you to know something the devil hates hat God's people whether it be the natural Israel or the spiritual Israel the devil hates you that's right and he's against you he wants to destroy you he'll have no mercy on your family your little ones your children right the AG it doesn't matter they want one thing you eradicated that's they will not be happy until every Jewish person is dead because they want to wipe out that Seed of Abraham because Satan don't want the word of God fulfilled because zachariah's prophecy said that one day they'll get a revelation and they will mourn in their houses for the ones that they pierced and they will look on him whom they have pierced and they will mourn as if it was for their only son and they'll recognize their Messiah this was that they were blinded far but so we could come in and now the Gentiles are being blinded under the strong delusion because now it's faing to turn back you see we are the last of the Gentile age Le oia and the age is not over because it's a part of the Gentile dispensation and as long as the Gentile dispensation is on that we are in the leoan age that's right so well I'm in it but I'm not a part of it you're crazy that's foolish talking if you are in it you're a part of it you're either the Overcomer in it or you're the other one that's right that is wretched miserable blind and naked you're either the one going to sit on the throne with him or you're the one that's going to be rejected that's right because of your naked condition so you when when we see here is a part of the insanity of the age is what it is but you know the seventh seal with his open breaks the Silence of his coming and it ushers in the end time events and there Satan will have his final stand and the world that we know will crumble under its wrath now there have been seven continuous visions that I want to point out that God's Prophet had in this day and the reason why that we believe him to be a prophet is because because the bible promises Revelation 10:7 that in the days the voice of the seventh angel when he sounds the mystery of God would be finished God promises a Leo to and age messenger the seventh one God promises that before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord I'll send you Elijah the prophet and Elijah was a restorer so he would restore them back to true worship ter you know tear down the idols of Baal and rebuild the The Altar and put the sacrifice in the right place and the fire would fall and he would be Vindicated then by a pillar of fire so you know we there there's there's multiple reasons but another is because all of his Visions come to pass standing on the platform day after day I was just going back through just going back through some things this week in my mind as I went back thinking of as a boy being in brother Brandon's meetings thinking of the events that went on I called A A friend of mine um that I've known he was a son of the associate pastor to um Life Tabernacle and and um and so you know as as we as we talked and we visited there for some times I I was asking him just kind of put in his memory of the way that things went and and so as um as we talked and and visited um you know I I I could recall and go back over some some of the events and I went back and done some searches and thinking about the woman the woman that I as a boy 1963 I can remember brother brandham I can remember brother brandham there turning his back to the congregation and showing us as it was in the days of Sodom and calling people out one of them was a lady that that I went to church with her name was Sister Boyd called her by name said to here you you're Afflicted with Bur cus and she had btis in her arm and God healed her in that meeting she was a woman that I sat with in church many times would lay my head over on in her lap as a little kid and go to sleep sometimes during service take a little nap you know sometimes us kids need a nap even if they're old kids but anyway you know as I was going through that I I mean I I remembered I remembered different things different things that I I went through as a as a child and and remember why it is remember going over one more time what it is that we know these things are true you know I I I was in a meeting and Jimbo you might remember but there was a man by the name of Wayne Coleman in the meeting and Wayne was known as um he he went he he was a a wrestler and he be won awards as a Mr teenage America and and the and the strongest man I think he he um was right next to the the highest weight lifter somewhere around he could bench press like 605 lounds where the other got about 10 more pounds than him and and you know he was he he was there in the meeting he was preaching to the youth I went to his youth meeting he took a three point phone book which was about twice the size and ripped it in two in front of us showing his power and his strength and then he was speaking you know to the young people I read articles about him he died a couple of years ago he died now A couple of years ago with liver failure and after taking steroids and having hepatitis and other issues that went and he had a liver transplant and but he he he went under the the name his his stage name was Billy Graham he named him named himself after the that Evangelist Billy Graham and that was his stage name but he he was there in brother bram's meetings and it's on tape and Brother brandham Talks you know is speaking there and and and and that meeting and he and he turns to him and he says you he said something with your wife he said oh I see it now and the man at the moment he bows his head and says God forgive me and and when he when he does brother bradam said it's confessed now I was going to say it out out here before the public but I won't now but in the newspaper said you know he quit the ministry because he didn't pay enough and because he bed too many of his female flock so you know it was those kind of things that we would see in the in those meetings like that where where where God would discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and and things that was so accurate and so pinpoint because only the word can do this but anyway there was seven continuous visions that was given and brother bradam said as a servant of God I've had multitudes of visions of which none has ever failed and that's what they said of over and over and over and over of the accounts of his ministry nothing nothing ever failed and he said I there was seven major continuous visions that came to him one morning in June of 1933 the Lord Jesus spoke to him that and said that the coming the Lord was drawing nigh and the before that he came seven major events would transpire and he said I wrote them all down that morning I gave forth a revelation of the Lord and the first Vision that melini would invade Ethiopia and that nations would fall at his steps and that Vision surely did cause some repercussions some were very angry when I said it and would not believe it but it happened that way he just walked in there with his modern arms took over and the natives didn't have a chance but the vision also said mellan would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him this came to pass exactly as it said the next vision for told that an Austrian by the name of Adolf Hitler would rise up as a dictator over Germany and that he would draw the world into war it showed the SEC GRE line and how our troops would have a terrible time to overcome it and then it showed that Hitler would come to mysterious end the third Vision was in the Realms of world politics for it showed me that there would be three great ISM fascism Nazism communism and the ver two would be swallowed up into the third in the voice admonish watch Russia watch Russia keep your eye on the King of the North and I want you to remember she's got a part in this the fourth Vision showed great advances in science it would come after the the second world war it was headed up by vision of a of a bubbletop car that was running down beautiful highways under uh remote control that people appeared to be seated in in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of game to amuse themselves and I just ask where are we when we now have airplanes that are taking off Landing doing all their drills unmanned I'm not I'm not talking about drones I'm talking about full-fledged Fighters and and and then we then he said the fifth Vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centered mostly around women and God showed me that women began to be out of their place with the graning of the vote and then they cut off their hair and it signified they were no longer under the authority of man but insisted on equal rights and are in most cases more than equal rights and she adopted men's clothing went to a state of undress till the last picture I saw was this woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron and with this Vision I saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world watch now the the whole world coming under terrible perversion and moral plight listen then the six Vision There Rose up in America a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in a complete power and I believe this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision vision of some some woman rising in great power due to the popular vote by women and the last and the seventh Vision wherein I heard a most terrible explosion and I turned to look and I saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of America now church we are here in the end time and this is the vision and when we're looking at it we want to understand where are we in this Vision so we know where to place our faith now I'm going to cover some things today I'm going to try to do it within this next hour because I don't want to take a part two on this part but I want to cover some things that that we'll try to help you place and get some understanding of where we are in this day but as brother Brenham told us years ago and and I want you to look at his prophetic insight and and many times brother brandham would give what we might call opinions and a lot of times you want to say well that's just an opinion but you know if you have an opinion it's influenced or formed by by something that's right amen so it might be influenced by social media something you heard on the news could be something your parents taught you something you learned at church or at school or anywhere your opinion is made up of things that you have been exposed to so you develop an opinion may be right may be wrong so you say well this was the man's opinion well I tell you uh I would really be careful before I just dismissed it because the opinion of a godly man yeah is one much times greater than the opinion of an ungodly man and the opinion of a man influenced by the angel of the Lord and by thousands of Visions is a lot greater worth and value than somebody who ain't spiritual at all so now let's just take everything for what it's worth and try to go forward into this and understand where we want to place our faith now brother bramman he and recognized and acting on the word he said I wonder what takes place when the next president comes in of course he's on the eve of of Kennedy he said uh he said God gave us one Godly Man old Dwight eyes and hour what's the next thing comes in we might have a rat the next time sure enough but there's coming a pharaoh who doesn't know Joseph now that's prophecy well what prophecy the Bible I keep trying to tell you what's in the Bible is prophesying of the time so now so again he says he said they coming a pharaoh who doesn't know Joseph remember I'll get to that in a second politics is corrupted we know that and yeah you know Kennedy was our first Catholic President who knew not the freedom of religion as a Catholic being a Catholic he KN he knew not what he didn't know freedom of religion he came over we came here as a pro as a Protestant people there because we wanted freedom from the tyranny of Rome amen and even our daughters the Church of England which is patterned after Rome so again that's why we came that's why the Plymouth Rock that's why that's why the pilgrim fathers that's why all of these things that wanted a land where they could be free to believe what they wanted so we had the first president and that he did not have that for his he was a pharaoh who knew not our struggles and he said I believe you'll make a good president it's not him it's that system behind him wait till she gets wormed in the cabinet ever Waits again and then watch what happened but now I'm going to stop and just take a side step you talking about a pharaoh who not knew not Joseph right now we got a woman rising in power and she's now the vice president and looks soon looks like soon will be the the president and she has no ties listen to me she has no ties to our nation's proud history you know she's born to a woman who was not a citizen a dad from Jamaica who at some point became a naturalized citizen but it all points to that she was was born to parents who was just resided in America and were not citizens and by and by the way her her father Donald Harris is described as being a combative Marxist in Economist who is against our American way of life that's what they Herald him as so being born in America to immigrants she was she's deemed a natural born citizen and so they say that makes her elg of now and so after and of course that's to a new interpretation of the Constitution but after her parents divorced in 1972 at the age of seven she was raised in Canada and so then she comes back to America and she a a woman is a woman who is not connected to our forefathers to our American Heritage she wants freedom from religion no freedom of religion now you know they're all screaming democracy they're all screaming freedom and and and they're you know going to stand for our freedom what the freedoms is is the freedom to kill their babies the freedom to to marry same-sex Partners this freedom to change your children from a boy to a girl or a girl to a boy that's the freedoms they're talking about they're not talking about the freedoms that our GI has fought for to keep the world free right they want to destroy the very fabric of humanity now after the vision after this the vision

coming of the Lord yeah well we we'll have wars we're not been having Wars brother the next war will be nuclear destruction I can read you in the Bible in zechariah's Prophecy where the flesh will meet melt on people as they stand it's nuclear destruction that'll be the plague I can read you in the Bible in Revelation 13 where the Beast has the power to call down fire from heaven and consume and Destroy I can read that in the Bible now everything's at its end education's at its end juvenile delinquency is at its end children there's no hopes for children I'm quoting they done go inane let me tell you the only hope that your children will remain sane is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen not enough psychology in the world is going to help them the only thing that'll help your marriage is a baptism of the Holy Ghost not a marriage enrichmond seminar that ain't going to help it oh you may get a tool or this or that to help you a little bit I don't know but really the real fix is a good dose of the Holy Ghost it'll fix 99% of your marriage or more amen it'll fix your teenage rebellion amen the holy ghost in a man's life will make him a father instead of a a no good dead beat amen the holy ghost in a man's life will will make him masculine and care for his children and his family and nurt you instead of being trash in this Society I'm sorry I'm I'm I'm I'm fed up with some of the things that are going on in this world and if if I get a little strong in my speech maybe you can pull down a little Grace and say God help brother Tim have some Grace this morning but brother brandham said you can't go down here to school and get a kid with the education he's twofold more child of hell when he comes out then when he goes in that was 1960 when I started to school and I'm 70 years old now and I went to school on my first my sixth birthday September the 3rd 1960 but he said you can't send a kid to school and get him with the education he's twofold more child of hell when he comes out than when he went in that's right he's said let the teacher say something about it he said he'll get killed they'll form a little cluck and go out there and shoot the teacher and take him and string him up and and and he he talks about he said give give college education these kids he said they do need it but the devil's got them amen it it isn't it isn't the the fundamentals of Education that will be helpful in getting jobs it's all the liberal Arts it's all the leftist agenda that our educators are now demons in the school system demonizing your kids that's why you get the Holy Ghost before you go there amen and then he says childbearing at the end that Womanhood motherhood why birth controls practice everywhere little dogs took his place now we understand about Family Family Planning and and so on things like that but we're not talking about abortion we we're we're we're not talking about not raising children for and nurture them in the things of God and if you think that the love for family and children has been diminished out there then I want to say what about spiritually if the family has been attacked like that what about the church even message churches don't want those screaming shouting acts 238 blabbering screaming youngans come on now and they're practicing in our Church's spiritual birth control cuz they don't want them brought to birth amen morals there are no morals women dressing evil come through television all kinds of impers ation of evil persons people of Hollywood and it only got worse with social media and all these influences educations at the end politics at the end Wars at the end civilizations at the end all these things are at the end but what can we do what is next we at the end of all things let me tell you if you hadn't known it you are in the leoan age and there's not another age right the times that the Gentile ends with the leodan age that's what a prophet said now you think of the evil spirit of insanity in the world you know that evil spirit of insanity that can take a baby in the womb and they've now done this by the millions not one not two not a half a dozen Millions you know take a baby in the womb and kill it and yet to destroy an eagle's egg would be one year in prison and a $5,000 fine and under federal law a first offense of killing a bald eagle can bring up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine I I say protect the Eagles that's fine but look what they're doing to the kids this is insanity we have a world that is groping in in Insanity Whoever thought that a Supreme Court Justice would not be able to Define what a woman is who would ever thought that people would be go so insane that they could believe that a girl could change to a be a boy or male could decide to be a female or a cat or a dog brother or that a man could run as vice president who supported putting tampons and boys bathrooms that's sick I said that's sick who could have predicted the society would become insane but the Bible said it would he said they would be wretched miserable naked and not know it that's right could you imagine people becoming naked and not knowing it yet that's what Revelation 3 says the they to see age that they would not have the state of mind to know it that's how strong Insanity would be in the last day you said brother you've lost me in my sermon okay all of these demons coming out of the Abyss spirits of insanity I done told you what it is coming upon people amen taking over their lives running their homes in their marriages in their schools everywhere that you look yeah till we are living in an insane world the world is in a Sodom condition brother Bram would talk about it 1963 he said I was in my motel today out there laid a woman with not enough clothes to water a musket shotgun well you probably didn't understand that but you know a musket they had to they put the a wad and they packed the the pack with powder and put a wad on top and then you know it would it would fire it would fire there against that and and and then a bullet on top of the wad and and it would fire against that and and out it would go and he said there's not enough enough clothes on to wad that's about a piece about like a quarter to water a musket shotgun and he said don't you realize that's the de yeah and he said her husband was laying out the same way that cold wind they think their body's so pretty they have to show it don't you realize that's the devil's stripping their clothes off only the insane does that Legion did it because he was crazy and he said but we have that and we call it style that's called modern we call it the devil I wonder come on is there message Believers here today that could agree with that and say it's the devil it's not style it's not modern amen it's the devil and he said it's the devil possession demon possession not oppression so it's even went beyond just being oppressed they're possessed said sex sex is appeal he said is practice in school in churches and pastors are afraid to rebuke it and he said they get their own ideas because at their morg they never rebuke it buddy I tell you if you quit listening to the prophet then you you are you are get shocked by some of the things that I'm saying you better be listening to it amen he said I heard a minister say when they invented this blue stuff for the eyes and red lips and made it pretty your world a minister of the Gospel in the Pulpit would make a remark like that he needs a trip to Calvary that's exactly right when the Bible condemns it I I heard a man preaching the other day on the radio and said wow even a barn looks better with paint on it I said my wife ain't no Barn am Hallelujah I kind of Wonder the way God made her not some false front come on Amen because it comes and he said the Pentecostal group told his sister not this come into Pentecost now you got to understand that that is the last move of God Be Where God sent a prophet to them to bring them into further restoration cuz they had restoration of gifts they were really part of the Reformation but they had a restoration of gifts but but God was going to restore it all so he sends a prophet and he said a Pentecostal group told his sister to come to the place crying cuz she had her hair done up in the back of her head with long hair said your your spare tire might get deflated you must cut that hair off cuz the Bible said Isaiah 50 chap 5th chapter had round tires like a moon and now how can the bible say that a woman does now how can the bible say that a woman does an uncommon thing she's not fit to live with when she cuts her hair she proves and she dishonors her head and then long hair and then how can you make the Bible say something like that what's the matter with our Pentecostal women you've seen too much television you've seen too much of the world and not enough of God's word interest you now that's what the Bible said that's what the Bible said that's not me that's the Bible but you see you see it was like I was talking to that brother brother Neil Palmer from down in Manny that I was telling you was at Life Tabernacle you know it was once the whole of chrisom believed in Holiness you know Wesley brought this truth and HD it to the world that's right amen Holiness men do not smoke they're Sanctified you cannot have the Holy Ghost and suck cigarettes there's a demon on the end inside of you calling for that and it's got to be cast out and there is Deliverance for it amen you got to realize what it is it's killing you it's destroying you and and but I mean that's just that's that's just where Satan gets in the mild form he'll let you be a good person or whatever as long as you miss that life but you see it used to be the whole of chrisom believed in holiness ly brought this truth he he Herald it through the world you know uh they they taught that without Holiness no man shall see the Lord that's a Bible scripture by the way you see Holiness was not something new that brother brandham taught he was just defending the principles of Faith the things that they always and all had in common but now because and because with the women's lib here comes in with the women's lib uh the women's movement affect the church watch these demons out of hell coming now and calling it liberating women and comes right into the church and going to liberate the sisters and you know so what I found was with my with my cousins that was you know part of were and and my dad and his family part of his family was was oness people the other people on the other side were were Trinity and they were all Pentecostals but the ones that went pent went into the Trinity they all began to cut their hair paint their face wear trousers and next thing you know you know my my first cousins that were girl ministers in the church were wearing Min skirts that would make anybody blush why was that because the spirit got in the church pulling the women down why cuz she's a type of the bride and she is to reflect in her life the bride of Christ where the man is to reflect the groom the head of the body now so you see it got right in to there and he said what the trouble was he said the devil landed up here in Hollywood and come through television stripped off our women and done everything ungodly to be done and people call it all right you see and then he said then they called it liberation of women and he said it's a disgrace it is the works of the devil amen and because the headship of Christ was rejected in the church causing her lewdness and un addess and reject your husband then the woman who is representative of the Church begin to rebel against the headship of her husband now let me stop here just for a minute because a lot of times we got men want to stand up and they want they want to exert their Authority with headship let me tell you where headship lies and that is if your head is Christ right amen then your wife is supposed to be subject to you amen because you're going to rule by the word of God you're going to lead you're going to guide by the word of God you'll have those principles in your life you will follow that man as as he follows Christ amen but but you know you you you know some some of these backslid men want to get up and say well you got to do what I say no you don't you got to do what the word of God said the word of God takes preeminence over what any man say I don't care if he's your pastor that's right now and no Pastor let me just straighten that out no Pastor is ahead of the Bride either Christ is ahead of the Bride amen now so you know she's not for his seed to produce more like him she's to produce more like Christ right he's to he's to be a unic with no seeds of his own amen present the word of God and let her let the word of God be in the but anyway you know there again brother Brandon would tell us he says that that the I believe the world is gone completely insane you know it's the truth you know it's a time that people can't judge between right and wrong or truth and error and this is what the Bible said he said it would be they would call right wrong and they would make wrong right so now again he said you know he would give illustration he said woman 50 years ago if she'd have walked out like they're walking out now in their shorts or pikinis or whatever they call them said they would put them in a mental institution they would arrest them because they had lost their minds amen and he said it's still a mental deficiency yeah what will you say where's it coming from brother Tim is it just perverted food no it's the perverted gospel that is being preached that has caused them to have a mental deficiency and an insanity now L let's just let's go quickly I I'll tell you what they won't acknowledge it but that's a prostitute Spirit upon them that want to address that way now their mother taught them to do like that you know you had this woman Dolly Parton she's a granddaughter of a Holiness preacher she defied him and her church because she wanted to dress like the woman of the night now we have a whole world dressing like women of the night and they're actually naked and don't know it I mean do you know walking out with these shorts on it's just like walking out in their in their underclothes they're naked and they don't realize that I mean oh they would freak out you know if they were caught maybe in their panties but let me tell you what they're wearing is this as luden crud is that come on now amen and do you know it's an evil spirit that's anointing them and it comes from the abyss amen now like I said 100 years ago people knew that was wrong amen we we should nature itself should teach you that's wrong come on the only man in the Bible took his clothes off like that was Legion and and when he got his right mind he put clothes on so it just shows you when devil possession takes over and people are innocent in the sense that they are brought up that way they're taught oh this is cute and you know and from little girls are taught to walk out in the before the public in their in their underclothes scany dressed and it's insanity and it's because it is a part of what has come out of the Abyss now there's hideous things like the Bible said like Locust with long hair and it's to torment those women who cut their hair off and wait until we leave from here because what you see now is only amateure to what is going to be loosed in the tribulation they will go so crazy brother Bram told us he said they would see birds with a with wingspread of of of a mile long he said they would see ants the size of mountains he he said it'll be in their mind because they will go totally insane so the insanity that you see now is only amature to what is coming because it only magnifies you know in the tribulation period and right now you got you got men trying to act like beast and look like beasts and women trying to look like animals with pain on their face and everything else and they'll go totally insane until there will be those Spirits rise up to haunt those women teeth like liying s and the mental condition of people completely gone and I just want to just read this as I sum up this part he says oh God let me go Lord don't leave me behind Jesus let me go with you father I don't want to stay on this Earth to watch these tribulations coming on I don't stay here in this Insanity I don't want to stand here when OS sites people losing their mind we look at man trying to act like beasts and look like beasts women trying to look like animals paints on their face knowing that there were these things are predicted to happen and that thing will they will go so inane till Locust will rise up with hair like women to haunt the women and teeth like lions and things you said the mental condition of the people will be completely gone we see it in the making right now Lord help us restore us to the same mind of Jesus Christ Our Lord oh great leader of eternal life we accept your promise tonight father I plead for the people I plead for everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus I I pray Christ the son of God will come the hearts of every one of us Lord and mold us and make us into new creatures amen and change us when we see young men and so women so caught up in the web of the devil young man perverted Minds children dope addicts cigarette smoking drinking immoral Satan's Eden God it took you you 6,000 years according to Bible to make to build an Eden you put your son his wife in there to rule over it his bride and Satan come around perverted he's got 6,000 years and he's built his own intellectual Eden through science and education and so-called intelligence and he's build it into a mess of death oh God take us back to Eden Lord where there's no death where there's no sorrow granted Lord we stand humbly waiting for the second Adam to come for his bride make us a part of him ah that ought to be our prayer this morning amen give us the same mind of Christ because what is coming down and permeating our society is demon powers and demon possession but I got good news for you because the commission he gave to this church was in my name you will cast out devils and I've seen it happen people who were bound with cigarettes dope amen sex sins every other kind of thing set free amen put in their right mind made real fathers real mothers out of them that's the gospel I know that's the power of this Christ Hallelujah you talk about a Transformer it's a transformation that I change you from a sinner to a child of the Living God filled with the power and the anointing of the spirit of God we've got to escape the things that are coming because it's only going to get worse you don't want to be left behind let musicians come I got to stop somewhere where are we where are we in the vision where are we in the vision remember these whole things is out to destroy your faith because Jesus said when I come will I find Faith so he's trying to wipe out faith and when we see the spirits and what they do in the natural running past defenses going into homes murdering little fathers and mothers in front of their little children killing them killing children before their parents' eyes taken there instead of letting them get rescued make sure they don't there's not a victory and kill them before they can be saved Satan is out to get you that's why we need this Homeland more than ever that's why we need to flee to the word of God that's need why we need to run to the cross with all of our heart with all of our life why don't you ask him today to do that for you in your life will you bow your heads with me just a moment I didn't I didn't get to hi for what I wanted to speak about this morning I didn't want to have to do this again but I could go on for the next couple of hours talking about the influence from this realm and what is doing to destroy he's a thief he comes to Rob and to kill and destroy I talked to an old friend yesterday been a drunk most of his life he surrendered his heart to the Lord and he's just a baby Christian just started out but he God took away drinking from him I took a I took a look at him and spoke to him a few minutes I said that's a beautiful car you got he said yeah that's what you get when you get quit drinking said you have things you're blessed but you know when a man's out there in his mind filled and ebbed contaminated with the drunkenness of this world everything good he lose sight of it what God wants as men in His image men that will be real fathers men that will be supporters of their families that will lead them in righteousness that will reflect Jesus Christ what God wants for a woman is for her to be reflecting the Bride of Jesus Christ we're right here on the edge of Prophecy being fulfilled now I I don't know if this one that's running now will be that one I can't say sure looks like it but if she's she's not listen we've already had enough years to set our nation on the course of Destruction but what if she does get eight years where will we be then I don't know I know it happens right at the same time that autonomous Cars come out and we're seeing that and it comes out right at the same time that she rises in [Music] power she's prophesied to be evil a murderer rule as a queen that's a dictator she's prophesied she spoke of I you know I went through everything and maybe I'll bring it out in another another service brought brought through everything that brother brandom said about it every description and we're here we're in the [Music] vision the next thing the next vision is destruction well where are we do you know we now have in in our cabinet a woman that has been placed in [Music] [Music] there and she she wants to feminize the nuclear program she wants to make it where you know that we we lose our strength as a nation and that where we're vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy all in the quest of feeling good about it running on emotions rather than reality what kind of day are we living in what is the hour that we're in what what what what time is it what hour are we [Music] in when we see all of these things come to pass don't you [Music] realize that our only hope is to leave here are you ready let me just sum up whoever this woman is she's been prophesied to be vulgar immoral she has no Integrity she is a liar she's cruel and Wicked at heart she would Dominate and Rule as a dictator a wicked Queen and make the nation go at her steps and the nation will literally bow to her whims and wishes and by her wickedness lies and deception she will dominate and overpower her political opponents I got all of that that's a [Music] summary of what the prophet said would happen she's going to the nation will sink under influence as she pollutes our nation's Christian values until she causes this complete ruins and collapse and shortly after that the United States of America will cease to exist her power broken her military weakened so that our nation suffers nuclear destruction it's already been seen you know I I think of that even brother brandham having it and I realize everybody's Visions ain't Vindicated and I don't say this is was but even my mother in 1958 [Music] she had a vision of the United States All Over America and smoke bombs and craters Christian people everywhere have been warned that we're in the last day and when you when you realize where we're at in time then wouldn't it be prudent then to be prepared for the coming of the Lord wouldn't it be prudent to lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset you and really Surrender Your Heart To [Music] God wouldn't it be the right thing do you know not to be a foolish virgin but a wise one have oil in your [Music] lamp if you're not ready to meet the Lord [Music] you have an opportunity service after service the Holy Spirit sends us warnings I believe God's a god of first chances Second Chances third chances fourth chances but also believe that there's a line you can cross that you can never come [Music] back I believe there's a God riching Mercy that reaches out that'll reach right out to you to where you are turn your life around I believe he's a God that cares even when everybody else has forgotten you he still cares even when the church the pastor quit praying for you he still [Music] cares he'll reach further down than what you can look up why don't you let him work in your life today won't you just say Lord I I'm just going to admit it there's some spirit that has been holding me back but I want to be free I don't want to serve sin no longer I want
