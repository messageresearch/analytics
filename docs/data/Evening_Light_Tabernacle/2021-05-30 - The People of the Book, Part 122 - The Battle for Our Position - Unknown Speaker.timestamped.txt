[52:12] take fear and doubt and unbelief out of
[52:14] our lives and cause this lord to
[52:17] to walk in the unity of the faith and
[52:20] the knowledge of the son of god
[52:22] until we're a perfect man in christ
[52:25] lord i pray for your children everywhere

[52:29] hear the voice of the son of man
[52:32] and live today may that rise up lord

[52:45] i know there's moms and dads and
[52:47] brothers and sisters and
[52:49] lord different ones that are crying out
[52:51] lord because they know their loved ones
[52:53] are out there
[52:54] estranged from you and they want to they

[54:00] to us through us today
[54:02] in jesus name amen

[54:09] house of the lord today

[54:19] home my children
[54:21] amen i believe that there has been a
[54:23] work of grace in this day to bring his
[54:26] bride his elect people
[54:28] back to the land of promise amen
[54:31] it's so good to be with you and you to
[54:34] be here with us we miss those that are
[54:36] not here
[54:36] but we pray that they will receive a
[54:38] special blessing today
[54:40] we're going to read from daniel chapter
[54:42] 12 again
[54:43] today it's a scripture that i have been
[54:46] ministering on in the last
[54:48] little bit but i want to
[54:51] go beyond that today into some things
[54:53] that i
[54:54] really um want to share with you as the
[54:57] lord has been dealing with my heart
[55:00] we pray earnestly and and um
[55:03] put our hearts into every service
[55:06] so we're believing that we're here right
[55:08] at the scripture where we need to be
[55:09] this morning
[55:11] amen amen god bless you daniel chapter
[55:14] 12 verse 1
[55:15] and at that time shall michael stand up
[55:18] the great prince which standeth for the
[55:20] children of thy people
[55:22] and there shall be a time of trouble
[55:23] such as never was since there was a
[55:25] nation even to that time
[55:27] that same time and at that time that
[55:29] people shall be delivered
[55:32] everyone that shall be found written in
[55:34] the book aren't you glad
[55:36] your name is in the book and many of
[55:39] them
[55:40] that sleep in the dust of the earth
[55:42] shall awake someday everlasting life
[55:44] some to shame and
[55:45] everlasting contempt and they that be
[55:48] wise shall shine
[55:49] as the brightness of the firmament and
[55:51] they that turn many to righteousness as
[55:53] the stars
[55:55] forever and ever but thou o daniel shut
[55:57] up the words and seal the book even to
[55:59] the time of the end and many shall run
[56:01] to and fro in knowledge shall be
[56:03] increased
[56:04] amen god bless you can be seated we're
[56:07] going to be
[56:08] speaking here today as we look here at
[56:11] the people of the book
[56:12] and we're going to be speaking on our
[56:14] the battle for our position
[56:17] because we have been commissioned and
[56:20] called
[56:21] and ordained in this age and been given
[56:23] a promised land
[56:24] but like israel was when they were given
[56:27] a land
[56:28] they found it possessed and inhabited
[56:31] and they had a job of dispossessing
[56:35] the adversary and taking possession
[56:39] of the promised land so today we're
[56:42] going to be speaking along that
[56:44] line and we see again that michael
[56:46] stands up or he arises
[56:49] for the purpose of deliverance it is um
[56:52] during a time of trouble such as never
[56:56] before and i believe we are have arrived
[56:59] these things were prophesied in the
[57:02] scripture and spoke about an end time
[57:04] and
[57:04] i believe that we are here and we also
[57:08] know that in a few chapters before
[57:10] for your reference it would be chapter
[57:12] 10 that there was a war in the heavens
[57:16] and there were angelic battles that were
[57:19] going on
[57:20] where gabriel fought against the prince
[57:22] of persia
[57:24] in order to get revelation to to
[57:27] daniel daniel was was searching in the
[57:30] books
[57:31] to be able to find out what was to be
[57:35] done in his hour he knew the time was at
[57:38] hand
[57:39] he knew it was a time for the people to
[57:42] leave babylon and go back to their
[57:44] promised land
[57:46] and so he began to fast and began to
[57:48] pray and began to call on god
[57:51] and um and it was 21 days that he prayed
[57:55] and he wouldn't give up
[57:57] he kept persevering and we
[58:00] always need to take admonition from that
[58:02] because we
[58:03] know when a promise of god is there you
[58:06] don't give up on it
[58:08] you keep seeking and keeping on seeking
[58:10] you keep asking and keeping on asking
[58:12] knocking and keeping on knocking
[58:14] you don't you just don't knock once and
[58:17] well he didn't answer so you give up on
[58:19] it but no you
[58:20] you hang on to that promise
[58:23] jesus told us it was like the unjust
[58:26] judge
[58:27] um and the the widow woman that come to
[58:30] him to say
[58:31] uh advent me of mine enemies and so
[58:35] um he said i i don't fear man
[58:38] and i don't even fear god it was unjust
[58:41] judge but he said that
[58:42] this is what i do fear i fear this woman
[58:45] will wear me out by coming
[58:48] and if i don't adventure of her enemies
[58:50] she's not going to give up
[58:52] so i'm going to adventure of her enemies
[58:55] and this is what he taught us to do to
[58:58] pray
[58:59] and not to faint or not to give up
[59:02] and and so um in the if we just could
[59:06] realize that uh if we stay believing
[59:10] holding on to promise we're going to win
[59:13] the battle amen now
[59:16] we we know from the reading that we just
[59:19] read that only those whose names
[59:22] are written in the book will be
[59:24] delivered
[59:25] and in this time the wise shall shine as
[59:28] the stars or
[59:29] as the sons of the messiah and those who
[59:33] know their god
[59:34] shall do exploits and we
[59:37] we can look back in the biblical
[59:40] histories and we can see
[59:42] men like abel or
[59:45] enoch or noah or abraham isaac
[59:49] jacob joseph men who shone
[59:52] as the stars amen that they were the
[59:56] bright lights
[59:57] in their age and their time and he tells
[1:00:00] us
[1:00:00] in here that this end time people is
[1:00:03] going to shine
[1:00:04] just like they did amen that they will
[1:00:07] persevere
[1:00:08] in their days and their hour just as the
[1:00:12] sons of the messiah
[1:00:14] and that they that know their god will
[1:00:17] do
[1:00:17] exploits and so it's a time of trouble
[1:00:21] but yet it's also a time of deliverance
[1:00:24] and this deliverance includes a
[1:00:26] resurrection
[1:00:28] and of course we new testament believers
[1:00:30] know by the further revelation of the
[1:00:33] scripture
[1:00:34] that the alive and remain also at the
[1:00:36] coming of the lord are to be
[1:00:37] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:00:39] an eye
[1:00:41] and um so again this is
[1:00:44] this is something that we know there's
[1:00:46] not just something done for the dead
[1:00:48] but for also those who are alive and
[1:00:51] remain
[1:00:52] will be changed and we also notice that
[1:00:55] this
[1:00:56] book is sealed until the time of the end
[1:00:59] so the words of the prophecy were not
[1:01:02] meant to be
[1:01:03] understood until the last days
[1:01:07] and it would be at the last days that
[1:01:09] that the book would be
[1:01:11] open so we can see it is alluding to the
[1:01:14] fact that
[1:01:15] there will come an end where the book
[1:01:18] will be
[1:01:19] opened was a time of sealing of
[1:01:22] of hush quiet is not through this time
[1:01:25] go that way daniel rest in your lot but
[1:01:28] um
[1:01:28] there's going to come a time of
[1:01:30] fulfillment and i'm thankful to know we
[1:01:33] are in an hour
[1:01:34] of fulfillment where all the word that
[1:01:37] has been pointing to this day
[1:01:39] and pointing to this hour is now being
[1:01:42] fulfilled
[1:01:43] and so it is during this time though
[1:01:46] that
[1:01:46] angelic wars begin and i want to
[1:01:51] really capitalize on this we've been
[1:01:54] speaking for
[1:01:55] some time on the angels and the angelic
[1:01:59] influence and but we also want to
[1:02:01] realize
[1:02:02] that this is a time of war
[1:02:05] where that there are battles that are
[1:02:07] not just going on the
[1:02:09] earth although angelic wars
[1:02:12] uh become human battles but yet at the
[1:02:16] same time that there is a
[1:02:17] disturbance in the heavenlies where that
[1:02:21] there are things that are happening
[1:02:24] bringing about these
[1:02:25] end time events when these it's not an
[1:02:27] accident we're here
[1:02:29] where we are this has been pre-planned
[1:02:32] and predestined of almighty god and you
[1:02:35] are predestined and pre
[1:02:37] pre planned to be right here in this
[1:02:40] hour in this time for this great battle
[1:02:43] and so in this great battle is a where
[1:02:46] angelic wars begin
[1:02:48] where michael arises to to bring
[1:02:52] an escape in the time of trouble now
[1:02:54] this
[1:02:55] this parallels many scriptures it
[1:02:57] parallels end times events of the lamb
[1:03:00] taking his stand
[1:03:01] of revelation 10 1 the mighty angel
[1:03:04] standing on the land in the sea they're
[1:03:07] standing
[1:03:08] all of these things are symbolic
[1:03:10] representation
[1:03:12] of the rising the moving of
[1:03:15] the of god as he moves about
[1:03:18] bringing this rapture this deliverance
[1:03:22] that is promised now we can see by
[1:03:25] natural evidence in natural israel
[1:03:28] israel that uh how that nothing's short
[1:03:31] of the miraculous
[1:03:33] but by heaven's decree and by
[1:03:36] interventional
[1:03:37] intervention of angels that but that
[1:03:40] israel israel is the bride's natural
[1:03:43] counterpart
[1:03:45] israel is in her homeland now after
[1:03:47] thousands of years
[1:03:49] how was it that she was gathered back to
[1:03:52] that homeland is nothing short of the
[1:03:55] miracle working hand of god
[1:03:58] and the tender hand of jehovah
[1:04:01] brother branham would parallel them he
[1:04:03] said it was a tender hand of
[1:04:05] jehovah leading them back to the tree of
[1:04:07] life
[1:04:08] because they have to be in their
[1:04:10] promised land in order to receive their
[1:04:12] messiah
[1:04:13] for the two prophets to come to them and
[1:04:16] we have to be as a people also
[1:04:20] people under the tender hand of jehovah
[1:04:22] called out of the denominations
[1:04:24] rooted up from our homes the churches we
[1:04:27] were in
[1:04:28] for hundreds of years our families was
[1:04:30] there
[1:04:31] maybe your family on on the pew there or
[1:04:34] they uh
[1:04:35] they were charter members or they were
[1:04:36] in this denomination or whatever
[1:04:39] and you you had to leave from there
[1:04:42] why was it because they had turned them
[1:04:44] into
[1:04:45] into a holocaust they had come there
[1:04:49] into concentration camps
[1:04:51] to where that your soul was starving
[1:04:54] and you know you but yet it was a tender
[1:04:57] hand of jehovah
[1:04:58] leading you to the tree of life putting
[1:05:01] a hunger in you when others would die
[1:05:04] there when others would perish there
[1:05:06] god had uh something better in mind for
[1:05:09] you
[1:05:10] and that was to bring a word of
[1:05:12] deliverance
[1:05:13] and that word of deliverance would bring
[1:05:15] you to the tree of
[1:05:16] life amen back to the promised land
[1:05:19] where you can receive your messiah
[1:05:22] where a rapture could take place you see
[1:05:24] a rapture couldn't take place in the
[1:05:26] denomination
[1:05:27] it couldn't take a resurrection couldn't
[1:05:29] take place there
[1:05:30] god had to call you out back to the land
[1:05:33] to reveal to you the real christ
[1:05:36] the son of the living god this is what
[1:05:38] god had to do and all of this has been
[1:05:41] in this last age as natural israel types
[1:05:44] the spiritual bride who has
[1:05:46] returned to her ancient homeland as
[1:05:50] the people of the book and this has been
[1:05:52] our theme for some time because
[1:05:55] it is the unsealing of the book the
[1:05:57] revealing of its seals that
[1:05:59] gives us our rights to take a position
[1:06:03] in the land you see this this was
[1:06:06] um the ancient proof that was given to
[1:06:10] uh the the to israel when they
[1:06:13] when they found when there was a little
[1:06:16] baboon boy
[1:06:17] bedouin boy threw a rock down into a
[1:06:20] cave and
[1:06:21] and heard a a seal break
[1:06:24] amen and went in there and found the
[1:06:27] dead sea scrolls
[1:06:28] right amen this gave them
[1:06:32] the this gave them the book to the land
[1:06:35] or the title to the land
[1:06:37] this was our people we were here before
[1:06:40] anybody else this predates the muslim
[1:06:45] this predates
[1:06:46] the catholics this predates all the
[1:06:48] other churches that want to hang on to
[1:06:50] the holy sites
[1:06:51] we were here first this is our land
[1:06:54] god gave it to us it's written in the
[1:06:57] scrolls
[1:06:58] and i'll tell you the opening of the
[1:07:00] book it shows our inheritance in the
[1:07:02] land
[1:07:03] this is our land this is our scripture
[1:07:06] this is our message there are others
[1:07:09] that want to lay claim to it
[1:07:10] but it belongs to the bride of jesus
[1:07:13] christ
[1:07:14] my name is in this book this is my
[1:07:17] family heritage
[1:07:18] this is where i descend from this is
[1:07:21] my anchor in the land it is the proof
[1:07:25] that i've always been here that i lay
[1:07:27] claim to this promise
[1:07:29] that my fathers were were there matthew
[1:07:31] mark and luke
[1:07:32] and john my fathers were peter and
[1:07:36] and paul and and all the other disciples
[1:07:39] my father
[1:07:40] was jesus christ and it goes back into
[1:07:43] the old testament
[1:07:44] it is that was me there and david i have
[1:07:47] a claim to the lamb
[1:07:52] we are just now celebrating
[1:07:56] a memorial day and god bless all the
[1:07:58] veterans that have stood and
[1:08:00] helped to bring freedom to this land of
[1:08:03] america
[1:08:04] and god bless you for your service those
[1:08:07] of you that have
[1:08:09] and but how however you know we have now
[1:08:12] a woman in the white house
[1:08:15] her name is kamala she has no ties to
[1:08:18] this land
[1:08:20] her family one come from from my
[1:08:23] what was it jamaica and another from
[1:08:25] india
[1:08:27] and she was just born here and got got
[1:08:30] the right to stay
[1:08:31] and and maybe her parents had become
[1:08:34] naturalized
[1:08:35] but she has no ties to lincoln
[1:08:39] she has no ties to washington and
[1:08:42] and this this week it was notable that
[1:08:45] when she
[1:08:45] sent out her tweet she said have a happy
[1:08:48] long holiday nothing said about
[1:08:52] our troops nothing reminding and
[1:08:54] remembering the men who had died so we
[1:08:57] could have holidays
[1:09:00] you see she has no ties to the land
[1:09:04] even her fathers didn't help to get this
[1:09:06] land
[1:09:07] her grandparents didn't help get this
[1:09:10] land
[1:09:10] i mean they have no vested interest in
[1:09:13] this land
[1:09:14] there wasn't she wasn't freed by lincoln
[1:09:17] she has no attachment to our heritage
[1:09:22] and i want to tell you there are people
[1:09:24] that are claiming christianity
[1:09:26] that have no attachment to the book they
[1:09:29] have no attachment to the promises
[1:09:31] they have no attachment to the man of
[1:09:33] david or
[1:09:34] or daniel or isaiah or jeremiah they
[1:09:38] have no attachment
[1:09:40] to peter or paul or the the books of the
[1:09:43] bible
[1:09:44] they don't find their identity there
[1:09:46] they find their identity
[1:09:48] in a social club rather than being their
[1:09:50] identity
[1:09:51] written in the book
[1:09:57] they don't rejoice in the wars that are
[1:09:59] won
[1:10:01] they have no appreciation for the
[1:10:03] freedoms
[1:10:05] except the freedom to turn the grace of
[1:10:07] god into lasciviousness
[1:10:14] now but we have an attachment to the
[1:10:18] book
[1:10:20] we have an attachment we have connection
[1:10:23] there
[1:10:24] that was my father that was
[1:10:28] my god amen that was
[1:10:31] that was him that became flesh and dwelt
[1:10:33] among us
[1:10:34] i have descended from him i am his
[1:10:37] child this is my land and my promise
[1:10:42] when it speaks of a rapture it may not
[1:10:44] mean anything to anybody else but it
[1:10:46] means something to me
[1:10:47] because it's speaking of me
[1:10:51] amen it is my promise when it speaks of
[1:10:53] healing
[1:10:54] maybe everybody else discounts it and
[1:10:56] say well we don't believe that these and
[1:10:58] miracles are passed it is for you
[1:11:01] because you have no attachment to the
[1:11:04] book
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:08] now you see
[1:11:11] it is the unsealing of the book
[1:11:15] the removing of its seals that gives us
[1:11:19] our rights to take our position in the
[1:11:22] land
[1:11:24] because it opens the book breaks the
[1:11:27] seals on it so we can see
[1:11:30] our identity with the promise
[1:11:34] now our kinsmen as we see in revelation
[1:11:38] 5 is handed the seven sealed book of
[1:11:41] redemption
[1:11:43] and it is handed him from the original
[1:11:46] owner
[1:11:48] we lost possession of this great title
[1:11:50] deed book when adam sinned
[1:11:54] and he lost his position of sonship and
[1:11:56] the book then went back in the hands of
[1:11:59] the original owner which was god
[1:12:02] but now satan contests it because he
[1:12:04] says it does not belong to us
[1:12:08] because of sin we sold out to him
[1:12:13] so he claims that there are liens on the
[1:12:16] book
[1:12:17] or liens on the title that keeps us from
[1:12:20] possessing
[1:12:21] our inheritance now and of course
[1:12:24] since adam did this and sinned and lost
[1:12:28] his position of sonship
[1:12:30] and surrendered his title of of the
[1:12:34] to the lamb that there has been a
[1:12:36] squatter on the land
[1:12:38] since that time and that's the devil
[1:12:42] satan has does does not own the earth
[1:12:45] it does not belong to him and what i
[1:12:47] wanted to say i also want to put satan
[1:12:50] on notice this morning that this body is
[1:12:52] of earth
[1:12:55] and it doesn't belong to the devil
[1:12:58] he has no right to it he is only a
[1:13:02] squatter
[1:13:04] and we're only here at a time where he
[1:13:07] can squat because
[1:13:08] we are at a point of the jubilee
[1:13:12] and the purpose of the breaking of the
[1:13:14] seals is to fully
[1:13:16] give inheritance back to the sons of god
[1:13:20] as noted in revelation 5 we see that the
[1:13:23] lamb does not keep the book for himself
[1:13:26] but he takes the book and he removes its
[1:13:28] seals
[1:13:29] and then in revelation 10 you see
[1:13:32] a transition of the book from from
[1:13:35] heaven to earth
[1:13:37] and i want to i want to get it back to
[1:13:39] you the the title
[1:13:40] deed has now been brought by the
[1:13:43] anointing of the mighty angel
[1:13:46] down to earth where that you can be a
[1:13:49] possessor
[1:13:50] of the title deed now
[1:13:53] this this is shown as heaven moves
[1:13:57] and as revelation describes another
[1:14:00] mighty angel
[1:14:02] with a rainbow over his head whose
[1:14:04] countenance is like the sun
[1:14:06] this covenant angel christ coming as the
[1:14:10] messenger
[1:14:11] of his covenant and he is seen
[1:14:13] descending
[1:14:14] with this book that is now open
[1:14:17] and he positions his feet on the land
[1:14:21] and the sea you can see he is claiming
[1:14:25] possession now satan is a squatter he
[1:14:28] doesn't legally
[1:14:29] own title to you or to this earth
[1:14:33] let me just make it clear you never
[1:14:36] originally belonged to the devil
[1:14:39] god had first claims on you it meant
[1:14:42] long before you ever even breathed your
[1:14:45] first breath
[1:14:46] here you had a beginning with him
[1:14:49] in the eternities because you began in
[1:14:52] the very mind and the thoughts of god
[1:14:55] which are eternal
[1:14:57] this gives an eternal quality to all of
[1:15:00] god's elect that remains
[1:15:02] that you are not just a time being but
[1:15:05] you are an eternal being and as an
[1:15:08] eternal being you
[1:15:10] are like jesus who said i came from god
[1:15:13] and i'm going back to god i fell from a
[1:15:17] position because of sin
[1:15:19] but i'm going back to where i come from
[1:15:23] amen i am i am only here
[1:15:26] so journey through this time of
[1:15:28] mortality
[1:15:29] but i have a greater future than that of
[1:15:32] this mortal realm
[1:15:34] i have a future in the eternals
[1:15:37] with my god as an eternal son of god who
[1:15:41] will never die
[1:15:42] who will never fall amen fall away
[1:15:46] forever
[1:15:46] one who whose fall was only temporary
[1:15:50] because of redemption he has come to
[1:15:53] restore us
[1:15:55] now satan is a squatter he doesn't
[1:15:58] legally own title to you or the earth
[1:16:00] but
[1:16:01] he possesses it right now
[1:16:04] even if he doesn't possess your soul
[1:16:07] you're born again he no longer possesses
[1:16:09] your soul
[1:16:10] no longer does that dark shadow that
[1:16:13] spirit his brother brethren would say
[1:16:15] you have a trouble it's cancer but you
[1:16:17] got a deeper shadow than that and that
[1:16:20] you are
[1:16:20] that that is your center you see
[1:16:23] we were all sometimes darkness
[1:16:27] but now we are light in the lord
[1:16:30] is that right amen his brother branham
[1:16:33] would see
[1:16:34] as they were healed i see it turned
[1:16:36] light around you see they were
[1:16:38] sometime darkness but then they were
[1:16:40] light
[1:16:41] when redemption comes it is the day
[1:16:45] star the sun as the sun shining into a
[1:16:49] a darkened place and is bringing the
[1:16:52] light of the glory of god
[1:16:54] amen oh my when you know that they
[1:16:57] the morning the bible speaks of it as
[1:16:59] the
[1:17:00] wings of the morning and
[1:17:03] when the sun rises you remember what it
[1:17:06] was like when the sun rose in your heart
[1:17:10] and man it defused the doubts it
[1:17:12] diffused the fears it
[1:17:14] it it revealed the sin
[1:17:18] it exposed it where you could get rid of
[1:17:21] it
[1:17:21] where satan had no place to hide the the
[1:17:24] time of your
[1:17:26] your past darkness now fled away as the
[1:17:29] as the light shone and the wings of the
[1:17:32] morning
[1:17:33] began to show its rays of lights
[1:17:36] and and there you know the morning came
[1:17:39] and dawned within your soul
[1:17:41] as the day star the sun rose within you
[1:17:45] yes the wind of god now satan is a
[1:17:48] squatter
[1:17:50] he doesn't legally own title to your
[1:17:51] earth
[1:17:53] he doesn't look entitled to this earth
[1:17:58] but he possesses it but i want to tell
[1:18:00] you
[1:18:01] and i want to remind satan of his
[1:18:04] final place revelation 2010
[1:18:08] and the devil that deceived them was
[1:18:10] cast
[1:18:11] into the lake of fire and brimstone here
[1:18:14] you're
[1:18:14] in though satan you may be a tormentor
[1:18:17] today
[1:18:18] you may be a squatter today
[1:18:21] but i'm telling you about your end the
[1:18:24] devil to see them was cast in the lake
[1:18:26] of fire
[1:18:27] and brimstone where the beasts and the
[1:18:29] false prophets are and
[1:18:30] shall be tormented day and night forever
[1:18:34] and ever
[1:18:35] amen i don't know how long that will be
[1:18:38] but i know
[1:18:39] he'll eventually come to an end satan
[1:18:42] will not be
[1:18:43] saved no sir he will be torment listen
[1:18:47] amen i i don't know how long he'll be
[1:18:49] tormented but i'll tell you
[1:18:51] as long as he has tormented the earth he
[1:18:53] will be tormented
[1:18:55] ten times more amen now so
[1:18:58] again as we look at this revelation 2014
[1:19:02] and not only that but his instrument
[1:19:04] death
[1:19:05] and hell are death and the grave
[1:19:09] were cast in the lake of fire this is
[1:19:11] the second death
[1:19:13] and whosoever was not found written in
[1:19:15] the book of life
[1:19:16] was cast into the lake of fire
[1:19:19] amen why because they don't belong here
[1:19:25] now in revelation 12
[1:19:28] revelation 12 he is seen
[1:19:32] in the heavens i'm talking about lucifer
[1:19:35] heaven a place where he is
[1:19:38] ruled there now since the fall of man
[1:19:43] as the accuser of the brethren
[1:19:47] now for thousands of years
[1:19:51] he has contested man's rights to the
[1:19:54] earth
[1:19:55] including the earth of his own body
[1:19:59] it was the prayer of jesus and every
[1:20:02] saint
[1:20:03] prays the same way as jesus taught us to
[1:20:06] pray
[1:20:07] that that thy kingdom come god's kingdom
[1:20:10] come
[1:20:11] again to the earth where god's will will
[1:20:13] be done
[1:20:15] in this earth as it is in heaven
[1:20:19] amen now right now i can't control
[1:20:22] all the earth out here but there is this
[1:20:24] earth
[1:20:25] this body that i have amen that i can
[1:20:28] say
[1:20:29] that kingdom has come it is the holy
[1:20:32] ghost
[1:20:33] it's where he is the king and where he
[1:20:36] is the king
[1:20:37] god's will is done in this earth just
[1:20:40] the way it would be done in heaven
[1:20:42] this is the striving of every true
[1:20:45] believer
[1:20:46] to give god that kind of preeminence in
[1:20:49] their earth
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:52] now there was in the old testament
[1:20:55] some laws that were set forth that
[1:20:58] reflected
[1:20:59] god's great plan one of them was the law
[1:21:01] of jubilee
[1:21:03] in the old testament if a man through
[1:21:05] indebtedness lost his inheritance
[1:21:07] the squatter could only hold it until
[1:21:10] the year
[1:21:11] of jubilee in other words he could take
[1:21:14] it for a
[1:21:15] time he's just showing you the squatter
[1:21:17] has a time
[1:21:20] amen somebody asked me the other day you
[1:21:22] know
[1:21:23] why is it that after the bride is gone
[1:21:25] that
[1:21:26] all satan's venom is poured out upon the
[1:21:29] remnant of the woman's seed and upon the
[1:21:31] 144 000
[1:21:33] and upon the upon the gentile church
[1:21:35] that goes through the tribulation
[1:21:37] why is that i said because the bible
[1:21:39] said that satan is cast out
[1:21:42] and he knows he has but a short time
[1:21:45] you see he has but a time
[1:21:49] i want you to understand you're not a
[1:21:51] time being
[1:21:52] you're not temporal you will be here
[1:21:56] throughout the eternal ages when satan
[1:21:58] is no more
[1:22:01] come on now you are here you predate him
[1:22:04] and you amen you predate him and you
[1:22:07] also will be here
[1:22:09] long after he's gone amen and you can
[1:22:12] look at your sickness your troubles your
[1:22:15] problems and things that you face today
[1:22:17] and you know they're only temporary but
[1:22:20] you're not temporary thank god we're not
[1:22:23] temporary
[1:22:25] amen amen we are not the people who can
[1:22:28] be
[1:22:28] conquered or defeated but we are people
[1:22:31] who are
[1:22:32] undefeatable now when the
[1:22:35] when the jubilee trumpet sounds it's
[1:22:37] time to throw down your hole
[1:22:40] and return to your inheritance as we
[1:22:42] have spent some time on this i've shown
[1:22:45] you
[1:22:45] that this is where the day of pentecost
[1:22:48] fully comes it is the pentecost of
[1:22:51] pentecost
[1:22:52] as we have explained of the seven weeks
[1:22:55] after the passover then comes the
[1:22:57] then comes the time of jubilee or the
[1:23:00] time of the 50th day which jubilee means
[1:23:02] the 50th
[1:23:04] and so when the jubilee trumpet would
[1:23:06] sound it's time
[1:23:07] to throw down your whole and it shows us
[1:23:11] and it's a time
[1:23:12] of the sounding of freedom and if
[1:23:15] there's anything that this
[1:23:17] message should all do to you it should
[1:23:19] be a sound
[1:23:20] a trumpet call of freedom amen that
[1:23:24] today
[1:23:25] you can lay down your hope you can drop
[1:23:28] your shovel amen you don't have to turn
[1:23:31] one bit of soil more for the devil
[1:23:34] you work no more for him you're not his
[1:23:37] slave
[1:23:38] any longer you are not in bondage to
[1:23:40] some of his denominational systems
[1:23:43] you are free people you have been set
[1:23:46] free and he that the son is set free
[1:23:48] is free indeed amen now this is shown in
[1:23:52] type from calvary
[1:23:53] where jesus died for 50 days the
[1:23:56] resurrection was questioned
[1:23:58] you know they questioned the
[1:23:59] resurrection
[1:24:01] for 50 days you know people could wonder
[1:24:04] some
[1:24:04] who had not seen him could wonder
[1:24:07] and the and it was questioned satan said
[1:24:09] he didn't raise from the dead
[1:24:11] he still says today he's not alive
[1:24:14] even even paid the soldiers to say that
[1:24:18] the disciples came and stole away his
[1:24:20] body
[1:24:20] by night the thought of it was you know
[1:24:23] it was just
[1:24:24] another creed of new denominations
[1:24:27] starting up and
[1:24:28] and you know you you look at all of this
[1:24:31] time
[1:24:32] since then the signs of his resurrection
[1:24:35] we we have longed to see that but we're
[1:24:39] living in the hour where the signs of
[1:24:42] the resurrection
[1:24:43] has been manifest but now there for that
[1:24:46] 50 days or those seven weeks after the
[1:24:49] passover and the resurrection
[1:24:52] there there were many that could
[1:24:54] question it
[1:24:55] there were many that could ponder and
[1:24:57] wonder
[1:24:58] and but on the 50th day on the day of
[1:25:02] pentecost
[1:25:03] the legal owner came down and showed it
[1:25:06] was more
[1:25:07] than just a new creed a new denomination
[1:25:10] starting up another same old ism of
[1:25:13] judaism or another
[1:25:14] phariseeism or sadducees it was more
[1:25:17] than another ism
[1:25:19] it was the filling of the holy ghost
[1:25:21] that
[1:25:22] burst sons into the in in houses of
[1:25:25] earth that was once enslaved
[1:25:28] by the devil men and women boys and
[1:25:31] girls who had been
[1:25:32] once laid enslaved by the devil whose
[1:25:35] members defied god whose hands did evil
[1:25:39] whose eyes run to do evil whose
[1:25:43] whose thoughts was on evil continually
[1:25:46] men and women who were born enslaved to
[1:25:49] sin
[1:25:50] that they got liberated not only were
[1:25:52] they liberated they were built
[1:25:55] by the spirit of god and then bodies
[1:25:58] that once
[1:25:58] served the devil that was a slave to sin
[1:26:01] whose hands were left to do and evil
[1:26:04] now they were their bodies the members
[1:26:07] of their body
[1:26:08] are yielded to do righteousness
[1:26:13] that was god's earnest money to his
[1:26:15] church
[1:26:17] and it showed it would not be controlled
[1:26:19] by organizations
[1:26:21] it would be the earnest of the baptism
[1:26:23] of the holy ghost with power
[1:26:25] and the love of god but i want you to
[1:26:27] notice
[1:26:28] it was the earnest amen
[1:26:33] in my other words it was the first
[1:26:34] payment
[1:26:37] which means there comes a day
[1:26:40] when the full payment is made
[1:26:45] where one had partial redemption
[1:26:49] another age finally comes to the time of
[1:26:52] full redemption
[1:26:55] and in this redemption possession
[1:26:59] of their land of their promises
[1:27:02] now the holy ghost of course is when
[1:27:05] god possesses you it is not rules and
[1:27:09] regulations
[1:27:10] passed down by bishop or a pope but by
[1:27:13] the spirit of the living god
[1:27:15] living in you now as i told you about my
[1:27:18] dream the other day i'm bringing and
[1:27:20] drawing a lot of inspiration from
[1:27:22] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:27:25] where that
[1:27:26] where brother branham tells us that
[1:27:28] god's great plan
[1:27:29] was revealed first in christ in order
[1:27:33] that he might get the preeminence in the
[1:27:35] church
[1:27:36] by bringing his life into a people
[1:27:40] and i want you to understand in our
[1:27:42] christian walk today
[1:27:44] it must be christ heaven preeminence
[1:27:50] now when we say that we do not mean
[1:27:53] a church having preeminence
[1:27:57] or a pastor having preeminence
[1:28:00] are rules and regulations of that
[1:28:03] church having preeminence
[1:28:07] you see people by church governments
[1:28:10] can be made to do a lot of things
[1:28:13] and factor that matter is church
[1:28:15] governments permit
[1:28:16] or prevent some people in the amish
[1:28:20] mennonite community
[1:28:21] from driving a car or
[1:28:24] it prevents them from driving a red car
[1:28:27] and they can only
[1:28:28] they can only drive a black car with a
[1:28:31] with a black
[1:28:31] bumper or you know it gives
[1:28:34] regulations on what kind of clothes that
[1:28:37] they will wear
[1:28:39] and in order to to do this you see they
[1:28:42] are not
[1:28:43] converted they are
[1:28:46] actually ruled by church
[1:28:49] governments now the idea that god has in
[1:28:53] this end time is not to rule
[1:28:56] you by pastoral rule or church
[1:28:58] governments
[1:29:00] like a lady you know a woman actually
[1:29:02] came to the church one time
[1:29:04] and she said you know i think brother
[1:29:06] tim is a reasonable man
[1:29:08] i think if you sisters would all go to
[1:29:10] him and talk to him
[1:29:12] real kindly and nicely that he let you
[1:29:14] wear pants
[1:29:17] and he'd allow you to cut your hair i'm
[1:29:20] sure he's a he seems like a nice man to
[1:29:23] me and if you'd all go to him
[1:29:24] and just you know talk to him reasonably
[1:29:27] he would agree to that
[1:29:29] but you see i didn't make the rules
[1:29:33] and i'm not the government
[1:29:37] and i'm not the enforcer of the
[1:29:39] government
[1:29:41] amen the enforcer is the holy ghost
[1:29:45] he abides in you and man he there is the
[1:29:49] rule
[1:29:49] of your life and he tells you what's
[1:29:52] right and wrong
[1:29:54] for he leads and guides you into all
[1:29:56] truths
[1:29:57] but you see denominations wants a
[1:30:00] man or a set of rules to give you
[1:30:04] that if you if you if you're in these
[1:30:06] boundaries you're safe
[1:30:08] you know you're going to go to heaven
[1:30:10] with the rest of us this is where
[1:30:11] your salvation is tied to a church but
[1:30:14] our
[1:30:15] salvation is not tied to evening like
[1:30:18] tabernacle
[1:30:20] our salvation is in christ and christ
[1:30:23] alone amen if we leave from here and go
[1:30:26] to another place somewhere
[1:30:28] you know we will not be lost amen we
[1:30:31] don't have to be here to go in the
[1:30:33] rapture
[1:30:35] amen you don't have to come here to get
[1:30:37] the holy ghost it's not the requirement
[1:30:40] and then your requirement is to meet
[1:30:42] christ
[1:30:44] salvation is in christ alone
[1:30:47] it's not an obeying church governments
[1:30:51] that means you can you can come along
[1:30:53] and you find the rule is
[1:30:55] well among these women they don't cut
[1:30:57] their hair well i'll never cut mine
[1:30:59] well they wear their dresses well
[1:31:00] they'll always wear dresses
[1:31:02] you know they don't paint their will
[1:31:04] we'll we'll do we'll throw away our
[1:31:06] our paint you know we'll none of that
[1:31:08] saves you
[1:31:12] none of that there is only
[1:31:16] one place of salvation and that's in
[1:31:18] christ
[1:31:19] and christ alone and you can tell
[1:31:22] if he's your husband by your obedience
[1:31:26] to the word but you see
[1:31:30] denomination puts a rule of man over man
[1:31:34] and
[1:31:34] man can change the rules
[1:31:39] but i can't change god's rules
[1:31:43] nice a man as i am
[1:31:47] and thank you for the compliment but i
[1:31:50] can't change the rules
[1:31:52] i can't change what god says
[1:31:56] now so you see the holy ghost is when
[1:32:00] god
[1:32:01] possesses you not rules and regulations
[1:32:05] passed down
[1:32:06] by a bishop or a pope but by the spirit
[1:32:09] of the living god
[1:32:10] dwelling in you amen i'm just telling
[1:32:14] you i this is why i refuse to be
[1:32:16] people's holy ghost
[1:32:19] if the lord don't convict you well then
[1:32:22] you know
[1:32:22] i me me going and making you do it is
[1:32:25] not going to do it
[1:32:27] amen you're going it's going to have to
[1:32:29] be a revelation of christ
[1:32:31] personally to you in christ the mystery
[1:32:34] of god revealed brother madam told us
[1:32:36] that so many people got the wrong
[1:32:37] conception
[1:32:39] and they do to convert people to
[1:32:41] christianity and this government
[1:32:43] is not god's thought at all you say well
[1:32:45] we make converts to christianity
[1:32:47] by his government that's not it well
[1:32:49] we're they're not
[1:32:50] they're not supposed to drink they're
[1:32:52] not supposed to lie see these are rules
[1:32:55] we don't drink we don't lie we quit
[1:32:58] doing this
[1:32:59] and we don't do that and he said do you
[1:33:01] know the muhammadans
[1:33:03] can outshine you you know the heathen in
[1:33:07] africa then black men they got laws
[1:33:09] among their tribes that outshine
[1:33:10] anything you can produce in christianity
[1:33:14] now but he's but it's not that you see
[1:33:17] it's not an organizational
[1:33:19] life of laws and mandates
[1:33:22] where you have to try to conform to the
[1:33:26] rules of the church
[1:33:27] but it's god making himself known
[1:33:31] personally in every individual
[1:33:34] every person where christ has the
[1:33:37] preeminence in you
[1:33:39] now we know when he has the preeminences
[1:33:41] because when you come
[1:33:43] subject to his word right amen but he
[1:33:46] said we're not supposed to
[1:33:48] make converts to christianity by
[1:33:50] government
[1:33:51] but by revelation the christ in you
[1:33:55] as god was in christ as god was in
[1:33:59] christ
[1:33:59] christ in you how did god come into
[1:34:01] christ he came into him
[1:34:03] first he prepared him as a body and
[1:34:06] there at the river jordan he comes fills
[1:34:08] him with his life
[1:34:09] is that right so what god did in christ
[1:34:12] to fill you
[1:34:13] with his life he does the same thing
[1:34:16] as he did with christ when god did that
[1:34:19] in christ
[1:34:19] a christ does in you what signs god did
[1:34:22] in christ
[1:34:24] god does in you christ doesn't you isn't
[1:34:26] that beautiful oh my
[1:34:28] i like that at that day when this that's
[1:34:30] this day
[1:34:31] at this day when this revelation is made
[1:34:34] known
[1:34:35] you will know that i am in the father
[1:34:38] and the father in me and i you and you
[1:34:41] and me when the revelation is made
[1:34:44] manifest
[1:34:45] at that day you will know that i am the
[1:34:47] father one
[1:34:48] i'm in the father and the father is in
[1:34:50] me and then when the revelation comes
[1:34:52] forth
[1:34:53] then it's i in you and you
[1:34:56] and me now he's not talking about a
[1:34:58] doctrinal revelation
[1:35:00] he's talking about the revelation of
[1:35:02] christ personally you
[1:35:04] in the new birth an experience where you
[1:35:07] meet god on your own are you with me
[1:35:11] now that day on pentecost was god's
[1:35:14] earnest money
[1:35:15] depositing the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:35:18] until
[1:35:19] full redemption of the ever son of god
[1:35:22] and then there would be a resurrection
[1:35:24] and a change
[1:35:26] in the great jubilee of jubilees and
[1:35:28] that's where we are
[1:35:30] the trumpet is sounding for that jubilee
[1:35:33] of jubilees
[1:35:34] you hear the trumpet i know what it said
[1:35:37] it said
[1:35:38] come out of her my people look at israel
[1:35:41] they heard a sound they heard a trumpet
[1:35:44] and them jews from all over the place
[1:35:46] they heard it said come out of her my
[1:35:48] people
[1:35:49] come back to your promised land come
[1:35:51] back
[1:35:53] amen amen
[1:35:59] here we are in the jubilees of the
[1:36:01] jubilees
[1:36:03] where the book has been taken by the
[1:36:05] lamb
[1:36:06] and not only have we received the irony
[1:36:09] of our inheritance
[1:36:10] but we're receiving the title to full
[1:36:13] redemption
[1:36:18] we have something that they didn't have
[1:36:22] at pentecost
[1:36:25] in the book of acts they had
[1:36:29] earnest money we are receiving
[1:36:32] the fullness
[1:36:38] now here in the jubilee of jubilees
[1:36:42] where we are receiving that full
[1:36:45] redemption
[1:36:45] mysteries that have been sealed become
[1:36:47] open
[1:36:49] because the angel of the covenant the
[1:36:51] pillar of fire
[1:36:53] we know what he did the one in the old
[1:36:54] testament
[1:36:56] that he became the lamb and the lamb as
[1:36:59] a man claimed the book and
[1:37:01] now as in the last day at this pentecost
[1:37:05] at the end of the seven ages the church
[1:37:08] is receiving the book and the title
[1:37:10] to their inheritance the title to the
[1:37:13] inheritance of truth
[1:37:15] of the one and living god the name of
[1:37:18] god amen not
[1:37:20] father son and holy ghost but the name
[1:37:23] given
[1:37:23] and revealed amen it's important that
[1:37:27] the children know
[1:37:29] who their father is
[1:37:33] so now the title to eternal security to
[1:37:36] the believer where
[1:37:37] we are sealed to the day of redemption
[1:37:41] the title to eternal life showing there
[1:37:44] is no eternal life in hell no one
[1:37:47] burns eternally there the fire is
[1:37:49] eternal because god's a consuming fire
[1:37:52] but as far as eternal life only in god
[1:37:56] dwells immortality
[1:37:58] so no one can live in more immortal
[1:38:01] without the immortal life of god
[1:38:04] so therefore only god dwells in
[1:38:07] immortality so we know
[1:38:09] the souls that sinneth you shall die the
[1:38:11] bible said there comes an
[1:38:12] end amen now
[1:38:16] but however all of these mystery truths
[1:38:19] and i just named two or three of them
[1:38:22] and one reason for that is because where
[1:38:25] i was studying that's those are the
[1:38:26] three that brother branham mentions
[1:38:28] i just mentioned them but i i just want
[1:38:31] you to know that
[1:38:32] all the mystery truths that are laying
[1:38:35] in the scripture
[1:38:36] all of the uh of the definition the
[1:38:39] landmarks
[1:38:40] of the promised land amen
[1:38:44] have now been revealed and we are
[1:38:47] living in a time where we can see the
[1:38:50] full scope
[1:38:51] of everything that god wants us to
[1:38:53] possess
[1:38:55] are you with me now looking today
[1:38:59] at modern israel and what is happening
[1:39:01] there the enemies of israel
[1:39:03] so perfectly type satanist squatters and
[1:39:07] they are insisting on possession without
[1:39:10] title
[1:39:14] but i want you to notice that every time
[1:39:17] that we make a claim on our inheritance
[1:39:20] satan is just like there in israel there
[1:39:22] is a riot
[1:39:24] that he is there to riot to hurl bombs
[1:39:27] our direction
[1:39:29] but god honors his covenant and
[1:39:31] continually
[1:39:32] defends his people although it seems all
[1:39:35] the world is against her and i assure
[1:39:38] you
[1:39:38] all of hell is against this bride
[1:39:43] all of hell has assembled against you
[1:39:46] fact of the matter is he even has more
[1:39:48] in his
[1:39:48] in his arsenal in this day in his army
[1:39:51] that there are
[1:39:52] there are 300 million more
[1:39:55] demonic spirits if you really got
[1:39:58] to that that that word 300 million is
[1:40:01] really not 300 million that's king james
[1:40:04] version for a large number it's an
[1:40:06] innumerable number
[1:40:08] you can't count how many demons
[1:40:11] have been allowed to come into here to
[1:40:15] make
[1:40:15] satan's eden and he's using every tool
[1:40:20] at his disposal
[1:40:23] come on now he's coming in every
[1:40:25] direction and every voice
[1:40:28] to keep you from hearing the true voice
[1:40:31] amen there's all kinds of voices going
[1:40:34] on and there
[1:40:34] the den of it is louder and louder
[1:40:36] that's why you young people you've got
[1:40:39] to hear
[1:40:39] the voice you can't just be hearing the
[1:40:43] voices of hollywood's in your video
[1:40:45] games
[1:40:46] and caught up in in a realm of a fake
[1:40:48] world in
[1:40:50] fake news and man you got to come back
[1:40:53] to the real gospel and hear his voice
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:58] because if any man will hear my voice i
[1:41:01] will come in and i'll suffer with him
[1:41:03] and he with me
[1:41:09] you got to come to the place where
[1:41:10] you're hearing where you're listening
[1:41:13] do you hear the trumpet sound do you
[1:41:14] hear the jubilee saying
[1:41:16] you can go free because there'll be a
[1:41:20] people that
[1:41:20] actually refuse to hear whose ears will
[1:41:23] be
[1:41:24] bored with an awl and they'll never hear
[1:41:27] another jubilee trumpet
[1:41:32] there's a line that can be crossed
[1:41:36] oh thank me to god he saved us from that
[1:41:38] line
[1:41:41] i was drifting deep in sin
[1:41:44] far from the peaceful shore
[1:41:49] you were too very deeply stained with
[1:41:52] sin
[1:41:54] seeking to rise no more but aren't you
[1:41:57] glad there's a master
[1:41:59] that reached down for you
[1:42:07] these squatters in the land of israel
[1:42:10] they insist on possession without title
[1:42:15] and so it is it was satan he insists on
[1:42:18] possessing
[1:42:20] though he doesn't own title
[1:42:23] and but you know but but again you can
[1:42:26] see that
[1:42:27] plainly the protection of the lord and
[1:42:30] his love
[1:42:31] for us that he continually shows that
[1:42:35] he will not allow his bride
[1:42:39] to be defeated they have sworn they
[1:42:42] would push
[1:42:43] israel into the sea and they have yet to
[1:42:46] do it
[1:42:48] and the devil has sworn that he will
[1:42:50] destroy us
[1:42:52] as he did in ancient egypt they're
[1:42:54] pushing the israelites
[1:42:56] trying to push them in the sea but in
[1:42:58] that moment god made a way through the
[1:43:00] scene
[1:43:03] now god uses his ministry like a
[1:43:06] like a armed military to take the land
[1:43:09] that he has given us to in his word
[1:43:12] and you look at israel you can see the
[1:43:15] mighty hand of jehovah the
[1:43:17] rebirth of israel is so genuine
[1:43:21] it's such a genuine miracle and the
[1:43:23] rebirth
[1:43:24] of the bride of jesus christ is nothing
[1:43:27] short of a miracle
[1:43:29] i want to i want to give something to
[1:43:31] you you you people that can come up a
[1:43:34] little late
[1:43:35] this message was founded on miracles
[1:43:39] it began with the miraculous hand of god
[1:43:44] showing us the possessions of the word
[1:43:46] of god
[1:43:48] and it's going to end with the
[1:43:50] miraculous hand of god
[1:43:52] as god raptures the people out of here
[1:43:55] changing us
[1:43:56] with a massive divine healing from the
[1:43:59] top of the head to the soul of the feet
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:04] this message began in the miraculous
[1:44:07] it's going to end in the miraculous
[1:44:09] amendment and let me just tell you it is
[1:44:11] now working in the miraculous
[1:44:14] it's not just something future and in
[1:44:16] the past it is a present
[1:44:18] because jesus christ was saved yesterday
[1:44:21] today and forever he is the i am
[1:44:24] the i am god that's who we serve the i
[1:44:27] am
[1:44:28] the ever-present god ever-present water
[1:44:31] from the rock
[1:44:34] the rock would follow israel and
[1:44:36] remember
[1:44:38] it was always in speaking distance
[1:44:41] that rock was christ and he's always in
[1:44:43] speaking distance
[1:44:45] even in your murmurings and you're
[1:44:47] crying and in your wanderings and your
[1:44:49] troubles
[1:44:50] he's still there speak to him
[1:44:56] out of him will come life given water
[1:45:00] but it's nothing short of a miracle
[1:45:04] it's because god is fighting our battles
[1:45:06] or we wouldn't exist
[1:45:10] you know you
[1:45:15] if wouldn't hadn't been fighting your
[1:45:17] battles
[1:45:19] look at the mess you'd be in today
[1:45:22] all you have to do is look around just a
[1:45:24] little bit with your friends or some of
[1:45:26] your siblings or somebody else
[1:45:30] all you have to do you don't have to
[1:45:32] look very far
[1:45:33] and you can see the mighty hand that god
[1:45:36] was on your life
[1:45:38] he watched over you from the time you
[1:45:40] were born to now
[1:45:42] he brought you by his tender hand to
[1:45:44] this place today
[1:45:45] you are not here by accident you're here
[1:45:48] for a predestined moment
[1:45:51] you have been handpicked amen when god
[1:45:53] chose out the seeds
[1:45:55] before the world began as to what seed
[1:45:57] he would plant on an
[1:45:58] age he reserved you for this time
[1:46:02] amen no matter how weak you may feel
[1:46:04] maybe maybe how
[1:46:05] how how unloved or uncared for you may
[1:46:09] feel how
[1:46:10] insignificant you may feel i want you to
[1:46:12] know this god
[1:46:14] had plans for you before the world began
[1:46:16] and he placed you
[1:46:18] right here in this age and this time for
[1:46:20] this hour for this moment
[1:46:22] to overcome all of the gates of hell
[1:46:28] and he'll take a week and press down and
[1:46:31] but the people who could have never made
[1:46:33] it on their own
[1:46:36] and he'll take it he'll make something
[1:46:38] out of them where they could have made
[1:46:40] nothing out of themselves
[1:46:41] [Applause]
[1:46:47] in 1948 within the hours within hours
[1:46:51] of israel's declaration of statehood
[1:46:55] the moment they proclaim to be a nation
[1:47:00] tens of thousands of soldiers from six
[1:47:03] arab
[1:47:03] nations armed with state-of-the-art
[1:47:06] british and french weapons
[1:47:08] they came and they were raid against an
[1:47:11] israeli army that was made up of high
[1:47:13] school students
[1:47:14] women men the majority who had never
[1:47:17] seen a battle
[1:47:21] who never had a day of real training
[1:47:23] much less genuine battle
[1:47:26] 45 million arabs
[1:47:30] were intent on pushing 400
[1:47:33] 000 jews that were there
[1:47:36] bunkered on a little tiny strip of land
[1:47:39] that comprised only
[1:47:41] one-eighth of one percent of the 6.1
[1:47:44] 1 million square miles of arab lands
[1:47:47] and they were bent on pushing them to
[1:47:50] the sea
[1:47:50] that's right there was hardly anybody
[1:47:55] that gave israel any hope shall never
[1:47:58] make it
[1:48:00] and i just want to quote to you from
[1:48:02] psalms 1 24
[1:48:04] 1 because this is true of israel it's
[1:48:07] true of you
[1:48:08] if it had not been the lord who was on
[1:48:10] our side
[1:48:13] now mans will say let's repeat it again
[1:48:16] maybe israel here this morning spiritual
[1:48:19] israel
[1:48:20] hearing your pew right now maybe you'll
[1:48:22] say it with me if it had not been the
[1:48:24] lord who is on our side
[1:48:27] now may israel say well man if it had
[1:48:30] not been when the lord was on our side
[1:48:32] when men rose up against us
[1:48:36] they had then they had swallowed us up
[1:48:39] quick when their wrath was kindled
[1:48:43] against us
[1:48:46] of satan's forces all the powers of hell
[1:48:50] were anointed men it would anoint men
[1:48:53] like stalin and hitler
[1:48:55] who had heartlessly killed the jews
[1:48:58] about who would take your babies and
[1:49:01] your little jewish babies and
[1:49:02] out of their mother's arm and dash their
[1:49:04] head up against a wall
[1:49:08] dr death who would stand there
[1:49:11] and take a young athlete who had a
[1:49:14] little problem with his foot and come in
[1:49:16] for examination
[1:49:18] who was there in their concentration
[1:49:20] camp how did you get to be an athlete
[1:49:22] i'm i'm a runner there and i've been
[1:49:24] i've trained for the olympics
[1:49:27] okay we're going to give you a little
[1:49:29] something to sleep here while we check
[1:49:31] your foot
[1:49:32] and they take him and dissect him piece
[1:49:35] by piece
[1:49:39] the experiments that they learned on the
[1:49:41] jews and they did on the jews as a part
[1:49:44] of what makes up a large part of our of
[1:49:47] our
[1:49:48] science that we have today in medical
[1:49:50] terms
[1:49:52] when you go and get an operation thank a
[1:49:54] jew
[1:50:00] why are you with me when you look at
[1:50:03] israel
[1:50:04] you know if it had not been that the
[1:50:07] lord was on their side
[1:50:09] they would have swallowed them right
[1:50:11] quick
[1:50:13] millions against 400 000
[1:50:17] think about you know
[1:50:20] all of these millions 45 million arabs
[1:50:25] and i want to say if it had not been
[1:50:27] that the lord was on our side
[1:50:30] as demons fled as blind eyes opened
[1:50:35] as cripples walked and cancer screamed
[1:50:38] for mercy
[1:50:41] then and then it was that denominational
[1:50:44] theories would give way
[1:50:47] to the name of jesus christ
[1:50:51] don't you realize if the lord had been
[1:50:53] not been on our side where would you
[1:50:55] be today some of you would still be
[1:50:58] wandering around and around in the
[1:51:00] confusion of the past
[1:51:04] amen you wouldn't be where you are today
[1:51:08] but for the grace of god god was on your
[1:51:11] side
[1:51:14] and when you look at israel's existence
[1:51:16] you have to know it's because the lord
[1:51:18] is on their side
[1:51:19] when you see our existence in this evil
[1:51:21] age when you see all of hell is against
[1:51:24] us
[1:51:24] it has to be the lord is on our side
[1:51:27] god is fighting their battles
[1:51:32] but he's using them to do it
[1:51:39] god's fighting our battles too
[1:51:43] but he's using you to do it
[1:51:46] you are his soldier his feet on the
[1:51:49] ground
[1:51:52] now come on quit quit murmuring about
[1:51:54] your heavy load now
[1:51:57] quit murmuring about your heavy army
[1:52:00] quit murmuring about oh this problem i'm
[1:52:02] i'm in this fight
[1:52:03] take the hill
[1:52:06] hold the line don't retreat
[1:52:11] quit murmuring and complain and say this
[1:52:13] is my battle
[1:52:14] and i'm gonna win it it is a
[1:52:18] battle for my position amen i
[1:52:21] will not be defeated in this amen i will
[1:52:24] not complain
[1:52:25] i will not get depressed
[1:52:29] i'll keep the right attitude toward the
[1:52:31] promise i mean i'm going to press the
[1:52:33] battle harder than i ever have a sword
[1:52:35] that's an invincible sword well it's
[1:52:38] hell with the hand of faith
[1:52:44] and i will believe in that sword i'll
[1:52:47] believe it enough to quit using it as
[1:52:49] decoration and press it to the heart of
[1:52:51] the enemy
[1:52:55] it's been a battle having it sister
[1:52:57] phyllis
[1:52:59] see you not in your head back there
[1:53:01] she's rejoicing because she can see
[1:53:03] again
[1:53:05] it's been a battle but isn't the victory
[1:53:10] sleek
[1:53:14] don't tell me he will give our sight to
[1:53:16] the blind
[1:53:18] i'm a witness that he doesn't don't tell
[1:53:20] daryl ward that
[1:53:21] that he gives that he don't give sight
[1:53:23] to the blind he's the witness of it
[1:53:26] amen we ought to be witnesses
[1:53:30] of how great our god is how miraculous
[1:53:34] is his power
[1:53:36] i gotta hurry i got a lot on my plate
[1:53:41] now god is using you to fight these
[1:53:45] battles
[1:53:47] god is using your battles too
[1:53:50] he's fighting your battles too but
[1:53:52] you're his army that he dwells
[1:53:54] in remember this is where he's fighting
[1:53:56] you are the boots on the ground
[1:53:59] he's already shown you he's led in the
[1:54:01] battle he's went ahead
[1:54:03] and he conquered hell
[1:54:07] the grave and every sickness
[1:54:10] now you go get your goliath
[1:54:14] that's your job he held up his head
[1:54:17] come on like david did he held up his
[1:54:19] head
[1:54:20] and shook him for the rest of the sea
[1:54:22] this is why he had to cut his head off
[1:54:25] and man he couldn't just leave goliath
[1:54:27] on the ground
[1:54:29] he had to show all of israel and the man
[1:54:32] was dead so he takes his own sword
[1:54:35] and he cuts his head off
[1:54:38] is that right then he holds up that head
[1:54:40] for all of israel to see
[1:54:42] this is what god did at calvary he took
[1:54:45] the head off of the devil
[1:54:48] he took the head off of goliath who
[1:54:50] called who who was
[1:54:51] who was lord over the grave over the
[1:54:53] over hell
[1:54:54] the grave over death
[1:54:57] come on somebody and he rose up
[1:55:01] a mighty conqueror and hell holds the
[1:55:03] head of death
[1:55:04] up and he says now i conquered this
[1:55:07] goliath
[1:55:08] you go conquer yours
[1:55:12] you got to fill this thing to chase off
[1:55:15] you got land to conquer
[1:55:18] every one of you got inheritance in the
[1:55:20] book if you've got your name in the book
[1:55:23] but guess what you got to say like caleb
[1:55:25] give me my mountain
[1:55:27] this is my mountain god gave it to me
[1:55:35] brother branham said in this let me read
[1:55:37] this quotation
[1:55:39] this is from putting on the whole armor
[1:55:42] he said god makes his self presence in
[1:55:45] his army
[1:55:46] you believe that now god said i sent
[1:55:48] them the word
[1:55:49] you just walked right over the top of it
[1:55:51] disbelieved it
[1:55:53] i'm god said i made it manifest and they
[1:55:55] crucified it
[1:55:56] i'm just getting tired i'm coming to
[1:55:58] myself so here you come
[1:56:00] god and you god above us the pillar of
[1:56:02] fire god with us
[1:56:03] in jesus christ god in us the holy
[1:56:06] spirit exactly what i dreamed about the
[1:56:08] other day
[1:56:08] my weapon the inspiration
[1:56:12] christ the mystery god in christ
[1:56:15] christ in you taking us back to eden
[1:56:22] same thing and i said that equates with
[1:56:24] the same sermon never thought of it
[1:56:26] before till that dream but that equates
[1:56:28] with the same sermon god above us
[1:56:30] god with us now god in us
[1:56:35] so god above us the pillar of fire god
[1:56:37] with us in jesus christ god in us the
[1:56:39] holy ghost
[1:56:41] no more trusting in anything else god
[1:56:43] come down himself
[1:56:46] amen this was a man-sized job so he
[1:56:49] brought it down he's talking about
[1:56:50] calvary now he didn't trust that with
[1:56:52] moses
[1:56:52] elijah any great prophet but he come
[1:56:56] down himself they won't have nothing to
[1:56:58] do about it but just
[1:56:59] let them now surrender themselves to me
[1:57:01] and i'll walk in them i'll talk in them
[1:57:03] i'll speak in i'm not working them i'll
[1:57:05] i'll do the work just let them be humble
[1:57:08] let them that's that's it you can't do
[1:57:11] it in yourself now you're no match for
[1:57:13] satan
[1:57:13] but if you just let god do it get the
[1:57:16] word in you
[1:57:17] then it'll all be taken care of now god
[1:57:20] fortified his army with what himself
[1:57:23] in the form of prophets apostles
[1:57:26] teachers
[1:57:26] pastors what did he do what was god
[1:57:29] doing listen did you ever
[1:57:30] think what the offices of the church is
[1:57:33] it is god's
[1:57:34] dress inside dress
[1:57:37] an apostle a prophet a tea a seer
[1:57:40] foresee before satan ever gets to it
[1:57:43] then told it
[1:57:44] what is his god dressed up in his church
[1:57:48] these offices is god's dress wear when
[1:57:51] you see those offices of
[1:57:53] pastors teachers evangelists what is
[1:57:55] that that's god's dress where
[1:57:57] god's presence god's spirit working
[1:58:00] through man
[1:58:02] now he said if that man denies any of
[1:58:04] the words you know that ain't god
[1:58:06] because god cannot deny himself but now
[1:58:09] notice here again you know there
[1:58:11] there it was i'm just reading about
[1:58:13] joshua going into the land
[1:58:15] how did he do it put the word on the
[1:58:16] shoulder of the levites
[1:58:18] and let him lead the way
[1:58:21] amen put the word let the word go before
[1:58:24] you
[1:58:24] let the preachers carry the word and you
[1:58:27] follow the word
[1:58:29] and the waters are going to open
[1:58:36] now the other day did you know hamas
[1:58:40] fired over 4 000 rockets
[1:58:44] at jewish communities
[1:58:49] but over there in their little control
[1:58:51] centers
[1:58:53] israeli women soldiers i kind of like it
[1:58:57] women soldiers not that i'm far women
[1:59:00] going to war
[1:59:02] but just equating this
[1:59:05] taking women soldiers and they sit
[1:59:09] at ease with a button release
[1:59:12] and they release powerful missiles to
[1:59:16] shoot down the incumbent missiles of the
[1:59:18] enemy
[1:59:19] and it produces a shield of protection
[1:59:22] against the enemy and when you get this
[1:59:26] little woman
[1:59:27] soldier come on this little bride of
[1:59:29] christ
[1:59:31] you get her sitting behind the word amen
[1:59:34] and in prayer
[1:59:35] there she's releasing the missiles
[1:59:38] against the attacks of the enemy it
[1:59:41] produces a shield of blood
[1:59:43] a shield of protection against the enemy
[1:59:46] [Applause]
[1:59:54] god is equipped as people with powerful
[1:59:57] weapons
[1:59:59] so that even the weakest among us are
[2:00:01] able to shoot down the missiles that
[2:00:03] satan continually launches
[2:00:05] and we're not just dodging missiles
[2:00:09] but this victorious bride is taking back
[2:00:12] her land
[2:00:14] amen that which was hours before satan's
[2:00:16] attack in the garden of eden
[2:00:18] i want to say oh what a warrior our god
[2:00:20] is
[2:00:21] he's a warrior god
[2:00:25] spiritual israel is under attack also
[2:00:27] everywhere she's under attack
[2:00:30] but our god's word is a perfect missile
[2:00:32] destroyer
[2:00:33] and no weapon can you hear me no weapon
[2:00:38] let him go get satan's best
[2:00:41] let him try something new let him come
[2:00:44] from another direction
[2:00:46] amen but no weapon that is formed
[2:00:49] against you shall prosper
[2:00:53] less is the heritage of the saints of
[2:00:56] god
[2:00:56] [Applause]
[2:00:59] what is the fight over why in the world
[2:01:01] i mean you know people are
[2:01:02] saying well why won't big old israel
[2:01:04] leave poor old palestinians alone
[2:01:10] what is a fight over well let me just
[2:01:14] say here
[2:01:18] back in in in in the 1940s
[2:01:23] the united nation gave the largest part
[2:01:27] of israel to trans jordan
[2:01:28] including half half of of of jerusalem
[2:01:34] actually they had all of jerusalem until
[2:01:36] they took it half of it from them
[2:01:44] but the palestinians don't want that
[2:01:47] land
[2:01:49] they want what israel is living on
[2:01:54] although they gave the majority of the
[2:01:57] nation the land
[2:01:58] that belonged to israel to the trinity
[2:02:01] to jordan
[2:02:04] and made the state of georgia jordan
[2:02:06] they don't want
[2:02:07] a place there you see egypt could easily
[2:02:10] give them
[2:02:10] a piece of land there but they don't
[2:02:13] want that land they
[2:02:14] want what israel has
[2:02:19] what is the fight over you may wonder
[2:02:21] what in the world is the fight over
[2:02:26] and i just tell you it's because satan
[2:02:28] wants the place where god has chosen to
[2:02:31] put his name
[2:02:37] now and where is that it's jerusalem
[2:02:45] start this for me
[2:02:47] or what i have to do oh she starts it
[2:02:52] i wanted to show you a few little things
[2:02:54] here and
[2:02:56] and i wish the people online could see
[2:02:59] this too i don't know how that can
[2:03:00] happen
[2:03:03] but i want you to see this
[2:03:06] you see the fight is over where god has
[2:03:09] chosen
[2:03:10] to put his name and first kings 11 36
[2:03:14] jerusalem the city which i have chosen
[2:03:18] me
[2:03:18] to put my name there
[2:03:21] [Music]
[2:03:22] so this is where that that at one time
[2:03:25] all men were to come to jerusalem
[2:03:29] to worship this was a place of sacrifice
[2:03:33] amen now there there is a scripture in
[2:03:37] the bible that is called
[2:03:38] deshima and it is it is the scripture of
[2:03:42] deuteronomy
[2:03:43] uh 6 and 4 that says hear o israel
[2:03:46] the lord our god is one
[2:03:49] lord and literally that means
[2:03:53] jehovah our god is one jehovah there's
[2:03:55] never two jehovahs
[2:03:58] there's no no not jehovah god there's
[2:04:01] not
[2:04:02] god the father and god the son and god
[2:04:04] the holy ghost
[2:04:05] there is one jehovah
[2:04:09] and he became in his sonship
[2:04:12] but created a body and father to body
[2:04:15] and kind of lived in it
[2:04:16] and his name was a given name it was
[2:04:19] given by the angel himself
[2:04:21] his name shall be called jesus
[2:04:24] which is jehovah the savior for he will
[2:04:28] save his people from their sins
[2:04:32] so this time jehovah is coming as a man
[2:04:34] he's coming to fight human battles he's
[2:04:36] the lord of glory he's the man of war
[2:04:39] he has been fighting for the people but
[2:04:42] he's coming now to take on flesh
[2:04:45] to fight it in human battles to defeat
[2:04:47] sin
[2:04:48] and darkness for them
[2:04:54] so you see the words the word here
[2:04:58] in there the word hero israel it begins
[2:05:01] hero israel this
[2:05:02] becomes the word shema oh there's a
[2:05:04] whole sermon maybe i'll preach on it one
[2:05:06] day i've got some notes put away
[2:05:08] on being the ability to hear
[2:05:12] but shema means to hear hear o israel
[2:05:15] the lord thy god is one lord or
[2:05:18] the lord your jehovah is
[2:05:21] our god is one jehovah the lord if you
[2:05:24] see it in all caps when you see that
[2:05:25] that's jehovah
[2:05:27] in the king james now so this first
[2:05:32] verse of the shema this is called the
[2:05:35] shema
[2:05:36] hero israel the lord thy god is
[2:05:39] one lord or jehovah god is one jehovah
[2:05:42] now jehovah's witnesses and some message
[2:05:46] revisionists
[2:05:47] say that jesus was not god shame on them
[2:05:52] most post-catholic denominations
[2:05:55] including the catholics believes that
[2:05:57] jesus
[2:05:58] is just a second person of the trinity
[2:06:03] of gods one god in three persons
[2:06:07] or three persons of one god that is a
[2:06:10] roman catholic
[2:06:12] invention here it comes back hero israel
[2:06:17] the lord our god is one lord
[2:06:21] he's not two lords
[2:06:24] he is one lord jehovah of the old
[2:06:27] testament
[2:06:28] is the jesus of the new that is the
[2:06:30] direct revelation
[2:06:33] that is given to you in this day to
[2:06:35] destroy the devil with
[2:06:38] that first of all you know who your god
[2:06:40] is
[2:06:42] he amen you you know
[2:06:45] some people have said who do i pray to
[2:06:47] god the father
[2:06:48] god the son or god the holy ghost or do
[2:06:50] i give them equal time
[2:06:53] you know when you realize that here that
[2:06:56] it's
[2:06:56] one god one lord one faith one baptism
[2:07:03] amen that so it takes away the
[2:07:07] pluralities of god
[2:07:08] and shows that god is one god
[2:07:14] now so this jehovah
[2:07:17] of the old testament is the jesus of the
[2:07:19] new jehovah the savior
[2:07:22] of the new same god who is manifested in
[2:07:24] the pillar fire who is the same god
[2:07:27] who came flesh and went back to the
[2:07:29] pillar of fire
[2:07:30] i came from god the pillar fire i
[2:07:33] returned back
[2:07:34] to the pillar of fire when the pillar of
[2:07:36] fire is asked
[2:07:38] who he is i am jesus
[2:07:43] now again that is my name that is who i
[2:07:46] am i am jehovah the savior
[2:07:49] now ages ago ages ago
[2:07:53] the hebrew children chose the letter
[2:07:56] sheen to represent the unspeakable
[2:08:01] name of the one and only god kind of
[2:08:04] looks like
[2:08:05] a little bit like our letter w
[2:08:09] so this letter became to represent
[2:08:12] you know of all of the hebrew alphabet
[2:08:14] which happens to be the 21st
[2:08:17] letter of the hebrew alphabet
[2:08:20] there are they are here uh to make
[2:08:23] 21st there has to be three sevens
[2:08:26] seven is completion and god is complete
[2:08:29] in sevens and perfected in threes
[2:08:32] so it's not three persons but it's three
[2:08:34] manifestations of
[2:08:36] the same person so if you look there
[2:08:39] that is not three three distinct
[2:08:42] letters that is one letter
[2:08:47] with three different strokes of
[2:08:49] manifestation
[2:08:51] so now again you know keeping that in
[2:08:54] mind
[2:08:55] that you know keeping that in mind now
[2:08:57] here's what we want to show you
[2:08:58] here on this because this is beautiful
[2:09:01] that right here
[2:09:02] i've got a map of jerusalem
[2:09:06] and and in in what makes up jerusalem
[2:09:10] here
[2:09:11] is three distinct valleys
[2:09:15] very significant valleys within the city
[2:09:18] of jerusalem
[2:09:20] and one of them runs through the middle
[2:09:22] of the old city is the kindred violin
[2:09:24] there's the hennen valley in the
[2:09:25] tyropian valley
[2:09:26] these three valleys here are there
[2:09:30] in in jerusalem
[2:09:34] and i i want you just to see here that
[2:09:37] when you
[2:09:37] lay the letter when you lay the letter
[2:09:41] over there of the name of god that
[2:09:43] represents the name of god
[2:09:45] right in jerusalem
[2:09:48] is the shima or the sheen which
[2:09:51] is the the 21st letter representing god
[2:09:55] and it is shown here in the three
[2:09:57] valleys
[2:09:59] that make up jerusalem god literally
[2:10:02] remember when he formed the world he
[2:10:05] took his finger
[2:10:07] and he marked right here
[2:10:11] and he put with his finger there and he
[2:10:13] marked out
[2:10:14] valleys that would symbolize the name of
[2:10:18] god here is where
[2:10:19] and all the earth i put in my name
[2:10:28] now this is incredible as you think of
[2:10:31] it
[2:10:32] because again that the very city
[2:10:36] has upon it the name of god
[2:10:39] now watch this city also has three
[2:10:42] mountain heads
[2:10:44] this city has to see the zion ophel
[2:10:47] and moriah those are
[2:10:50] the three mountain heads there
[2:10:54] and it represents again one god in three
[2:10:57] different manifestations
[2:10:59] not not it's it's not three cities it's
[2:11:02] one god
[2:11:04] now notice again as we we look at it
[2:11:07] before the
[2:11:08] full revelation of the new testament the
[2:11:10] revealing of christ
[2:11:11] these names were already given to the
[2:11:13] mountain heads
[2:11:15] this isn't a recent conv invention
[2:11:18] but i want you to notice in the first
[2:11:20] one is ophel which in hebrew means my
[2:11:24] fortress
[2:11:26] my tower my stronghold
[2:11:29] this is who god was known in the old
[2:11:31] testament god above us
[2:11:33] was known as the fortress the tower and
[2:11:36] the stronghold
[2:11:38] he is a fail are you with me
[2:11:42] the lord is my rock jehovah is my rock
[2:11:45] my fortress my deliverer
[2:11:47] my god my strength and whom i will trust
[2:11:49] my buckler
[2:11:50] and the horn of my salvation and my high
[2:11:53] tower
[2:11:56] so this mountain here is one of the one
[2:11:59] of the the peaks are the
[2:12:01] mountain heads of the same mountain
[2:12:05] also on that mountain is a mount moriah
[2:12:09] it's called moriah in its peak and it's
[2:12:11] mountain head
[2:12:13] moriah we know is the place where
[2:12:18] way before then god sent abraham
[2:12:22] out with isaac to offer him
[2:12:26] he had to go was it three days journey
[2:12:29] something like that to go there god it
[2:12:31] wasn't just any place
[2:12:33] he wanted him at a certain place and he
[2:12:35] saw the place from afar off
[2:12:37] no doubt he had seen it by vision
[2:12:41] and he carries with him his son and he's
[2:12:43] going to offer his only son
[2:12:44] remember he you know ishmael has been
[2:12:47] sent away
[2:12:48] and now isaac is his only son in fact
[2:12:50] this is the only son god ever recognized
[2:12:54] he never recognized this mill at all he
[2:12:56] said to abraham
[2:12:58] take thine only son
[2:13:03] because the child of the bomb's woman is
[2:13:06] not to be heir with the free woman
[2:13:09] neither is the child of denomination to
[2:13:11] be heir with the bride
[2:13:16] she's a child of the bones woman are you
[2:13:18] with me now in hebrew the name moriah
[2:13:20] means
[2:13:21] to see god now let's stop here for a
[2:13:23] minute let's look here
[2:13:25] what happened here again abraham goes up
[2:13:28] this mountain
[2:13:29] his son is packing the wood
[2:13:32] just like jesus will pack his cross
[2:13:37] and man many many years later
[2:13:40] amen because god is acting out
[2:13:43] listen he needs somebody you think it's
[2:13:46] cruel
[2:13:46] god say go slay your son and god don't
[2:13:49] even slay your son but he's going to
[2:13:50] have
[2:13:51] god don't even receive human sacrifice
[2:13:54] is what i'm meant to say
[2:13:55] but he said go and sacrifice his son
[2:13:59] i've got to have a type i've got to have
[2:14:01] something to foreshadow this
[2:14:03] and you are the beloved father and now
[2:14:06] you have
[2:14:06] a son of the promise because it's a
[2:14:10] miraculous son that after
[2:14:12] sarah could not conceive i gave you a
[2:14:15] child
[2:14:15] so it's the son of the spoken word
[2:14:20] and i changed your body in order i is
[2:14:22] the son of the miraculous
[2:14:24] it's the son of the word
[2:14:28] now won't you there take him up there
[2:14:30] now he gets up there and he said here's
[2:14:32] the word
[2:14:32] here's the fire where's the sacrifice
[2:14:35] abraham said the lord
[2:14:36] wills provide the sacrifice
[2:14:40] he lays them there upon the altar and it
[2:14:42] was there that god spared
[2:14:45] isaac and revealed the lamb
[2:14:49] a ram that was tied in the thicket by
[2:14:52] his horns
[2:14:54] is that right showing us we should have
[2:14:57] been the one
[2:14:58] who died
[2:15:03] but god took our place by becoming the
[2:15:07] lamb
[2:15:09] are you with me now so he takes and he
[2:15:11] types
[2:15:12] all of this out and and he calls this
[2:15:16] jehovah jireh this mount jehovah torah
[2:15:19] the lord himself will provide a
[2:15:20] sacrifice
[2:15:22] or in the mount of the lord it shall be
[2:15:25] seen
[2:15:26] and i want you to know mariah is
[2:15:28] important because
[2:15:30] mariah here is expressing something very
[2:15:34] great
[2:15:35] it means to seek god or to be seen of
[2:15:37] god
[2:15:38] and it was in jesus christ in his
[2:15:40] manifestation of sonship
[2:15:42] that we saw god and that man was able to
[2:15:46] look
[2:15:47] god in the face thomas would be able to
[2:15:50] kneel before him and say my lord and my
[2:15:52] god
[2:15:54] amen there they they would
[2:15:57] recognize him as jehovah himself come on
[2:16:00] somebody
[2:16:01] because of moriah it was where
[2:16:04] god was seen come on now
[2:16:07] amen and where we see god face to face
[2:16:11] man to man and that is where god is with
[2:16:14] us
[2:16:15] so you have awful which means god
[2:16:19] god above us my fortress my high tower
[2:16:23] amen now you have moriah which in hebrew
[2:16:26] means
[2:16:26] to be seen of god or seen of god where
[2:16:29] god was seen among men
[2:16:32] hallelujah god with us
[2:16:36] amen now the last one here
[2:16:39] is zion the last of this mountain head
[2:16:43] is zion
[2:16:44] and it means the mark of the sign the
[2:16:47] pillow
[2:16:48] the pillar and you know what if
[2:16:50] ephesians 1 13
[2:16:52] says that after we believe we are sealed
[2:16:55] or we're marked with the seal of the
[2:16:56] holy spirit
[2:16:57] and because it's the mark of every
[2:17:00] born-again believer
[2:17:01] so god in us so he places his
[2:17:05] name in jerusalem and and again
[2:17:08] it's it's all foul god in his fatherhood
[2:17:12] moriah god and his sonship zion
[2:17:16] god in us the holy spirit not three gods
[2:17:19] but one god
[2:17:22] amen and his name is placed there
[2:17:26] and the only name that is given unto man
[2:17:29] where by men might be saved
[2:17:30] is the name jesus who came in his
[2:17:34] father's name
[2:17:35] so the father's name was jesus the son's
[2:17:37] name is jesus
[2:17:38] and the holy ghost name is jesus and
[2:17:40] there ain't three of them there's one
[2:17:48] amen now there you are
[2:17:51] so this is what all that fuss is about
[2:17:54] that's right
[2:17:54] we want the place where god puts his
[2:17:57] name
[2:17:59] can i have just a little more time
[2:18:03] okay well you know
[2:18:08] okay i know i'm guilty i i preach a
[2:18:10] button sermon every once in a while i'm
[2:18:12] hoping it won't be a button sermon this
[2:18:14] morning
[2:18:17] but i want you just to see hear what all
[2:18:19] the
[2:18:20] what is all the fight about what what is
[2:18:22] our battle about
[2:18:24] in second thessalonians two and three
[2:18:26] let no man deceive you by any means
[2:18:29] for that day shall not come except there
[2:18:31] cometh fallen away first
[2:18:32] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[2:18:34] of perdition who opposes and exalts
[2:18:36] himself above all that is called god
[2:18:38] or that is worship so that he is god
[2:18:40] sitteth in the temple of god showing
[2:18:42] himself that he is god
[2:18:43] so here again we see the very the very
[2:18:46] plan of the antichrist
[2:18:49] and that is to be sitting in the temple
[2:18:51] being worshipped as god
[2:18:53] i want that place of worship
[2:18:59] you see it's supposed to be in christ
[2:19:03] but i want it for myself
[2:19:07] this is where it happens this is where
[2:19:09] organization starts up that's why we got
[2:19:11] 45 million today organizations
[2:19:16] denominations
[2:19:19] is because in every one of them every
[2:19:22] little man wants to be
[2:19:23] god
[2:19:29] now so he says i will be worshiped
[2:19:32] i will have preeminence remember this
[2:19:35] whole thing of christ is a mystery
[2:19:37] when god can get preeminence in a people
[2:19:41] and now here's the fight colossians 1
[2:19:45] and 18
[2:19:46] and he is the head of the church or the
[2:19:48] body the church
[2:19:49] who is the head the firstborn from the
[2:19:51] dead that in all things
[2:19:52] he might have preeminence so
[2:19:56] the battle is all about satanic
[2:20:00] preeminence trying to keep you
[2:20:04] from your sonship
[2:20:08] so now what was the fall in heaven satan
[2:20:10] wanted preeminence over the sons of god
[2:20:13] he wanted worship what was the fall in
[2:20:16] the garden god in his word
[2:20:17] was to have preeminence is that right
[2:20:20] and satan uses a serpent to get headship
[2:20:23] and preeminence over the eve
[2:20:25] and thus he got headship over adam and
[2:20:28] he took positions
[2:20:29] over the sons of god amen
[2:20:33] and we were everyone born in this
[2:20:35] condition
[2:20:37] we were born dead to god in the lives of
[2:20:39] sin when you turn with me to ephesians 2
[2:20:41] and 1
[2:20:42] and you at to quicken that means he made
[2:20:44] you alive
[2:20:46] because you were actually born your
[2:20:48] first time
[2:20:49] dead you were dead to god
[2:20:53] and allowed to sin you were
[2:20:56] dead in your trespasses and sins where
[2:20:59] in times past
[2:21:00] you you walked according to the course
[2:21:03] of this world
[2:21:04] according to the prince of the power of
[2:21:06] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[2:21:08] the children of disobedience
[2:21:10] among whom also we had our conversation
[2:21:12] or our conduct
[2:21:13] in times past in the lusts of our flesh
[2:21:16] fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[2:21:18] and of the mind and were by nature the
[2:21:20] atmospheres that ruled over us
[2:21:23] made us do it we were the children of
[2:21:25] wrath even as others
[2:21:28] but oh i'm glad there's a bud here but
[2:21:31] god
[2:21:33] who is rich in mercy amen
[2:21:37] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[2:21:40] even when we were dead in sin
[2:21:42] he hath quickened us or made us alive
[2:21:45] together with christ resurrected us with
[2:21:48] him
[2:21:49] for by grace you were saved and his
[2:21:51] raises
[2:21:52] up together
[2:21:57] and made us to sit together
[2:22:01] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[2:22:06] so he has enthroned us with christ this
[2:22:10] is our real position
[2:22:13] his grace gives us a seat of dominion
[2:22:16] enthroned with christ over the desires
[2:22:18] of the flesh the lust of the flesh
[2:22:21] and desires of the mind the changing of
[2:22:23] our atmosphere
[2:22:24] being from sin with its doubt and
[2:22:26] unbelief
[2:22:28] so what is the physical fight over
[2:22:31] let's go back and look at israel for a
[2:22:33] moment
[2:22:34] israel they are the original owners
[2:22:39] given by god to possess the land nobody
[2:22:42] else is god ever give that land to
[2:22:44] muslims catholics baptists you know
[2:22:48] greek orthodox all of them that's got
[2:22:49] their
[2:22:50] little churches built here and there and
[2:22:52] it's quieting down on holy places
[2:22:54] it is not theirs amen israel are the
[2:22:58] original owners given by god to possess
[2:23:01] that land
[2:23:02] and you look at the history the bible
[2:23:03] proves it the dead sea scrolls reveal it
[2:23:07] and they show israelis israel's
[2:23:10] ownership of the land let me just say it
[2:23:13] this way
[2:23:14] the jews controlled jerusalem 1500 years
[2:23:18] until about 70 uh 70 a.d
[2:23:21] that rome took it and they controlled it
[2:23:23] to 600 a.d
[2:23:25] then the muslims could took control
[2:23:27] holding it to 1100 a.d
[2:23:30] and then from 1100 um to
[2:23:33] 1250 the crusaders with the christians
[2:23:36] attempted to take
[2:23:37] control back from the muslim and the
[2:23:39] power shift back and forth
[2:23:40] in 1250 muslim turks gained control into
[2:23:44] 1917.
[2:23:45] so in 1917 the british gained control
[2:23:51] so when you hear of the ishmaelites
[2:23:54] the children of the bombs woman laying
[2:23:57] claim to the land and the city
[2:24:00] in the natural that's the muslims in the
[2:24:03] spiritual that's the catholic and
[2:24:04] protestants
[2:24:06] did not nomination all of them lay and
[2:24:08] claim to be the place
[2:24:11] where god chose to put his name
[2:24:16] that they own jerusalem and it's here
[2:24:19] all men have to come to worship
[2:24:22] if you ain't with us you're lost
[2:24:26] that's the spirit of denomination
[2:24:29] i'm allergic to it you ought to be too
[2:24:34] but i want you to know they're not
[2:24:35] people of the book
[2:24:37] they are squatters on the lamb all of
[2:24:40] them
[2:24:40] romans were squatters come on
[2:24:43] amen the others were squatters all of
[2:24:46] them were squad the catholics have been
[2:24:47] squatters uh
[2:24:48] crusaders were squatters the irons have
[2:24:51] been squatters
[2:24:52] none of them are owners there's only one
[2:24:56] owner
[2:24:57] and that's the people of the book
[2:25:00] and i want to just tell you you know
[2:25:02] other people they may
[2:25:04] they claim to healing or deliverance or
[2:25:06] this or that yet
[2:25:07] but you're the owner that is
[2:25:10] your inheritance
[2:25:14] you have first claim on it you have
[2:25:18] first claim on every gift you have every
[2:25:21] first claim on every promise
[2:25:23] you have first claim on the baptism of
[2:25:26] the holy ghost
[2:25:27] you have first claim of divine healing
[2:25:29] you have
[2:25:30] first claim on any promise of the word
[2:25:33] of god it's yours
[2:25:34] first because you were there
[2:25:37] first that was you and david
[2:25:41] that was you there come on you're not a
[2:25:43] kamala
[2:25:44] that was you there that was you fighting
[2:25:46] over
[2:25:47] in delaware that was you there
[2:25:53] that was you with washington that was
[2:25:54] you brother adam was telling us
[2:25:56] that was you i was there i was there and
[2:25:59] he said to be a christian
[2:26:00] i was there that was me and david
[2:26:04] fighting goliath that's me today i'll
[2:26:06] fight my goliath
[2:26:08] amen that was me and moses i held the
[2:26:11] rod of the name of jesus
[2:26:13] and i'll take that rod today and i'll
[2:26:15] defeat it into me
[2:26:16] i'll call down heaven and strike the
[2:26:18] enemy till he's dead dead
[2:26:20] dead until he lets our people go
[2:26:23] that's me
[2:26:26] hallelujah that was me and daniel who
[2:26:29] said
[2:26:30] shut up the words until the last day and
[2:26:32] i'm here daniel
[2:26:33] i'm here to pick up where you left off
[2:26:36] because again
[2:26:37] michael has stood up the lamb has stood
[2:26:39] up the mighty angel has put his
[2:26:42] feet on the land of the sea and i'm here
[2:26:45] it's my hour it's my time it's my day
[2:26:48] it's my moment and that was me i have a
[2:26:51] claim to this land
[2:26:54] i have the claim for my children that's
[2:26:57] what the promise is unto them
[2:26:59] and to them that are far even as many as
[2:27:01] the lord our god shall call
[2:27:05] hallelujah i have a promise for divine
[2:27:08] healing
[2:27:09] it's just as real today as it ever was
[2:27:12] because i served jehovah
[2:27:13] that i am god
[2:27:19] it's mine praise god it's mine
[2:27:25] and i'm going to just say they're not
[2:27:27] people of the book
[2:27:29] we're the people of the book our names
[2:27:32] are written we've been revealed in that
[2:27:34] book
[2:27:35] and that day everyone should be
[2:27:37] delivered whose names are written
[2:27:39] in the book and mama that's me i see
[2:27:42] that when the seals come open
[2:27:44] i saw my name that's my identity i know
[2:27:47] who my god is i know my father
[2:27:49] i know where i come from i know where
[2:27:51] i'm going
[2:27:53] [Music]
[2:27:55] and i was surely in jesus christ when he
[2:27:58] defeated hell
[2:28:00] i was in him there
[2:28:03] you realize the bride had not been
[2:28:05] separated from the groom yet
[2:28:07] and when he went down to hell come on
[2:28:09] somebody amen i went there with him when
[2:28:12] he died
[2:28:13] i died with him when he rose i rose with
[2:28:16] him
[2:28:16] when he ascended i ascended with him i
[2:28:19] am there with him enthroned
[2:28:21] as a son of god i know my position i
[2:28:24] know my place
[2:28:26] and that's what the battles
[2:28:31] my land
[2:28:37] oh it's now it's not very much it's just
[2:28:40] one book in the massive
[2:28:41] world of man's literature but this is
[2:28:43] not man's literature
[2:28:45] this is god's literature
[2:28:50] they can lay claim on darwin you can
[2:28:52] have him
[2:28:56] amen come on they can lay claims on the
[2:28:58] edicts of the popes you can have them
[2:29:01] that's your land have it have at it
[2:29:03] enjoy it
[2:29:05] but this is my land
[2:29:10] it's not muslim land
[2:29:13] first of all muhammad never visited
[2:29:20] jerusalem
[2:29:23] you see islam landed
[2:29:27] in that land 2600 years
[2:29:32] after the jews were founded by abraham
[2:29:36] two thousand years after joshua
[2:29:39] established
[2:29:40] the nation of israel sixteen
[2:29:44] hundred years after david made jerusalem
[2:29:48] the capital of israel
[2:29:51] 600 years after christianity was founded
[2:29:54] there
[2:29:56] and the islamic dome of the rock is was
[2:29:58] not
[2:29:59] built on the temple mount until 687
[2:30:03] a.d long
[2:30:07] long after solomon put the temple there
[2:30:12] the jewish temple was there long before
[2:30:14] the islamic dome of the rock
[2:30:17] laid claim to that land it's not theirs
[2:30:21] it was a place where god chose to put
[2:30:24] his name and where the blood was
[2:30:25] accepted to take away sin
[2:30:28] for the meeting place is where the blood
[2:30:31] is
[2:30:35] there's where we're going to stop this
[2:30:37] morning
[2:30:41] because i want you to see the battle
[2:30:45] that we're in is over your possession
[2:30:50] of your promise and the higher you go in
[2:30:53] god
[2:30:54] the more you go to take your position
[2:30:56] the more you're going to be opposed by
[2:30:58] demon spirits
[2:31:01] some of you have made peace with the
[2:31:03] devil
[2:31:08] you're contempt to stay where you are
[2:31:12] you've traded a lot of land for peace
[2:31:19] you're willing to give up promises so
[2:31:21] he'll leave you alone
[2:31:27] you're real you're willing to be slacker
[2:31:29] and laodicea and have an
[2:31:30] apathetic view
[2:31:34] because you've never been revealed that
[2:31:36] you have acclaim to the land
[2:31:42] when i trace my genealogy back
[2:31:47] i'll trace it all the way to the pilgrim
[2:31:49] fathers
[2:31:54] when i signed up into ancestry.com
[2:31:57] i even can trace it back
[2:32:01] to the cherokees when they owned the
[2:32:02] land that predated the white settlers
[2:32:09] when i look into my genealogy i can go
[2:32:12] back
[2:32:12] and i can see my seventh
[2:32:15] great-grandmother
[2:32:16] was john adams sister
[2:32:20] and she was an aunt to john quincy adams
[2:32:27] i'm american that's who i am
[2:32:32] i have a vested interest in this land
[2:32:37] my people fought wars in this land
[2:32:43] to have the freedoms we have today
[2:32:46] that's me as an american
[2:32:48] but i want to tell you something as a
[2:32:50] child of god
[2:32:52] you have a greater inheritance than that
[2:32:57] you have a vested interest in every
[2:32:59] promise
[2:33:01] jesus is yours yes he's yours let the
[2:33:05] musicians come
[2:33:06] amen i i'll tell you if i go to
[2:33:08] preaching again
[2:33:10] it'll be a button sermon amen

[2:33:17] promise of god
