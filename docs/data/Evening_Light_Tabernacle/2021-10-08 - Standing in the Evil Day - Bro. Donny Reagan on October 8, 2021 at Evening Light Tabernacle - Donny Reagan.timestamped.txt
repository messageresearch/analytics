[53:57] tonight
[53:59] gentiles
[54:01] dogs
[54:02] out of the commonwealth of israel
[54:05] but yet we're saved

[54:25] word

[54:33] than all of our needs
[54:35] we call upon you tonight father in the
[54:37] name of jesus
[54:39] would you bring healing to the sick
[54:42] would you bring deliverance to the bound
[54:45] set free those lord god that satan has
[54:49] bound them
[54:50] not only in the visible audience but the
[54:53] invisible as well
[54:55] and we say to our enemy satan
[54:58] you
[54:59] are defeated
[55:02] the lord jesus defeated you 2 000 years
[55:05] ago
[55:06] and we are here tonight is his children

[55:40] we're not going anywhere
[55:42] we don't have any
[55:44] watches
[55:45] no schedule
[55:47] nobody will complain
[55:49] nobody will be angry
[55:51] nobody will ever be upset
[55:53] everybody will have the best neighbors
[55:56] on the street
[55:58] i'm talking about miracle after miracle
[56:00] afternoon
[56:04] this is not a figment of our imagination
[56:06] it's the truth
[56:08] amen
[56:09] the gracious and that in the name of the
[56:11] lord jesus what an honor it is to
[56:14] be here tonight
[56:15] with my brothers and
[56:17] my friend brother tim
[56:20] and uh
[56:24] it still feels a little bit
[56:26] odd
[56:27] sister karen not being here
[56:29] we certainly miss our sister we
[56:31] certainly loved her
[56:33] we wouldn't call her back to this whole
[56:34] world for nothing in this world way
[56:38] amen we certainly want to continue to
[56:40] pray for the family
[56:42] let's turn if you would tonight to the
[56:43] book of ephesians chapter 6
[56:46] verse 11.
[56:52] very familiar scriptures that we're
[56:53] going to read tonight
[56:56] i trust the lord will
[56:59] open it to our understanding
[57:02] put on the whole armor of god that you
[57:04] may
[57:05] be able to stand against
[57:08] the wiles
[57:09] of the devil
[57:11] and the word riles is
[57:13] trickery
[57:15] and craftiness
[57:18] for we wrestle not against flesh
[57:22] and blood
[57:24] but against principalities
[57:26] against powers
[57:28] against the rulers of the darkness
[57:30] of this world
[57:32] against spiritual wickedness
[57:35] and high places
[57:37] now listen to this hierarchy
[57:40] that is in the
[57:43] fallen angel realm
[57:45] remember when god created the angels
[57:48] initially they were all good angels
[57:51] but some of them left their first estate
[57:54] so paul describes them and uses the
[57:57] first word there against principalities
[58:00] the greek word is archaii which means
[58:03] the first
[58:04] in order
[58:06] so there's
[58:07] principalities
[58:09] there's
[58:10] powers
[58:12] and there's rulers of the darkness
[58:15] of this world this is what you and i
[58:17] face
[58:18] every day of our lives
[58:20] we cannot face these things
[58:23] by ourself
[58:26] rulers or the word there is actually
[58:28] prince
[58:29] princes of the darkness of this world
[58:33] against spiritual wickedness in high or
[58:37] the word there is heavenly in heavenly
[58:40] places
[58:42] wherefore
[58:43] take unto you the whole armor of god
[58:47] that ye
[58:49] may be able
[58:51] ye
[58:52] may be
[58:53] able
[58:55] which is have power whether by virtue of
[58:59] one's own ability or a resource other
[59:02] than yourself to be capable
[59:05] strong
[59:06] and powerful
[59:08] that you may be able to withstand
[59:11] in the evil day and having done all to
[59:14] stand
[59:15] stand
[59:16] oh my therefore
[59:19] having your loins gird about with truth
[59:22] having on the breastplate of
[59:23] righteousness your feet shod with the
[59:26] preparation of the gospel of peace above
[59:28] all
[59:29] taking the shield
[59:31] of faith wherewith you shall be able to
[59:33] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[59:37] and take the helmet of salvation
[59:39] and the sword of the spirit
[59:42] which is the word of god you notice this
[59:45] armor there's not one piece
[59:48] for your back
[59:51] every bit of it
[59:53] is right here
[59:54] why god don't want you running from the
[59:56] devil
[59:59] the bible tells me and you submit
[1:00:01] yourself therefore in the mighty hand of
[1:00:02] god resist the devil and he will flee
[1:00:06] from you
[1:00:09] let me read you this quote here from
[1:00:10] satan's eden in 1965
[1:00:13] i thought i would try to bring something
[1:00:16] to your mind
[1:00:17] with these scriptures i got written here
[1:00:21] that would enlighten you
[1:00:23] to know
[1:00:25] make you a better soldier
[1:00:27] in the field
[1:00:29] that you're fighting in
[1:00:30] now
[1:00:32] to learn the tactics
[1:00:35] of the enemy
[1:00:37] so that you can block
[1:00:39] everything
[1:00:41] before it gets to you see
[1:00:43] that's
[1:00:45] the main thing
[1:00:47] and when you get time sometime look up
[1:00:48] how many times he said that
[1:00:50] that's the main thing
[1:00:52] i wonder sometimes if we don't make the
[1:00:54] main thing other things it's not the
[1:00:56] main thing
[1:00:58] and the main thing we let go because we
[1:01:00] don't think it's deep i suppose
[1:01:02] but notice the way he says this so that
[1:01:04] you can block
[1:01:06] everything
[1:01:09] before it gets to you so not that god
[1:01:11] wants you to make mistakes and fall and
[1:01:13] then get up and go through the whole
[1:01:15] process of doing all that that's not
[1:01:18] overcoming
[1:01:19] but god wants to teach us
[1:01:21] how to block it before it ever gets to
[1:01:24] us
[1:01:25] that's what i want
[1:01:27] that's the main thing
[1:01:29] is to learn
[1:01:31] to keep the punches
[1:01:34] off of you
[1:01:35] as much
[1:01:37] as you can
[1:01:38] now we know the way life is there's so
[1:01:40] much of it
[1:01:41] we just can't keep off
[1:01:43] but i don't know about you i'd like to
[1:01:45] keep all of them off that i could
[1:01:49] you know i think not only would brother
[1:01:51] branham have this desire but every
[1:01:53] god-called man in this day would want
[1:01:55] this desire as a preacher
[1:01:58] don't you appreciate such man of god
[1:02:00] may god bless his word you may be seated
[1:02:08] i want to speak to you on
[1:02:10] standing
[1:02:12] in the evil day
[1:02:14] we all know that it's a terrible time in
[1:02:17] this hour
[1:02:19] we're dealing with darkness that the
[1:02:21] world has never known before
[1:02:23] we ourselves have been
[1:02:25] under an onslaught
[1:02:27] around the world
[1:02:29] uh this coveted situations brother ron
[1:02:31] mentioned it last night
[1:02:33] many pastors have passed away
[1:02:36] pastors wives evangelists
[1:02:39] we've never had anything really that's
[1:02:41] affected the message
[1:02:43] as far as pestilence and things like
[1:02:45] that quite like this has it's changed so
[1:02:49] many things about our world
[1:02:52] and yet we know
[1:02:53] that is only part of what we are dealing
[1:02:56] with
[1:02:57] but by looking at what paul said he gave
[1:03:01] us a little bit of an insight
[1:03:04] as to the hierarchy of evil spirits and
[1:03:07] we know that when god
[1:03:09] created the angels that he made them in
[1:03:12] an order and satan himself as though
[1:03:15] even as much as we are against him yet
[1:03:17] he still has an order in his kingdom and
[1:03:21] he operates what paul was dealing with
[1:03:23] was the order by which satan comes
[1:03:26] against the people of god now here
[1:03:28] tonight we've got several hundred people
[1:03:30] here in the building but you know it as
[1:03:32] well as i do that there are many more
[1:03:34] beings that are unseen
[1:03:37] than there are that are visible and we
[1:03:39] know that it comes in every gathering
[1:03:42] like this and they come to be able to
[1:03:44] torment they're also the angels of god
[1:03:47] which are the beings of light they're
[1:03:49] here to influence us in a supernatural
[1:03:52] way
[1:03:53] every day of our life we're pulled in
[1:03:55] this realm the prophet tells us there's
[1:03:57] three realms above us and three realms
[1:04:00] below us and we're here in the middle in
[1:04:03] the stream of time every one of us that
[1:04:05] are human beings get caught under that
[1:04:08] influence and we know that because we
[1:04:10] are still creatures of time our bodies
[1:04:13] our minds our spirits are still affected
[1:04:16] by such things and we know that the
[1:04:18] bible doesn't really open it up too much
[1:04:22] from all the way down to give us a view
[1:04:25] into that
[1:04:26] but on the occasion we're able to see
[1:04:30] what that supernatural realm was like
[1:04:33] daniel is one of the books that opens it
[1:04:35] up to us and we know that of course that
[1:04:39] a prophet once a prophet appears on the
[1:04:41] earth that a prophet is a window to the
[1:04:45] supernatural a prophet does not actually
[1:04:48] make the supernatural but he's just a
[1:04:51] gift of god by which god can project him
[1:04:54] into that realm and open up what was
[1:04:57] already there and he comes back and
[1:04:59] tells us what was there so it equips us
[1:05:03] as god's believing children it happened
[1:05:06] that way in the days of daniel the term
[1:05:09] if you would to the book of daniel
[1:05:10] chapter 10 verse 12 then said he unto me
[1:05:14] fear not daniel now this is the angel
[1:05:16] gabriel that is sent to daniel because
[1:05:19] daniel had set his mind and his heart
[1:05:22] and his soul to seek god and he began to
[1:05:24] pray and he had prayed and prayed and
[1:05:27] prayed and he had sought god for 21 days
[1:05:31] and yet there was no answer there was
[1:05:34] nothing supernatural that had happened
[1:05:36] and no doubt daniel was very much
[1:05:38] perplexed as we can get sometimes and we
[1:05:42] know that whenever we pray and god
[1:05:44] doesn't move for us immediately it's not
[1:05:46] that our prayers are not being heard but
[1:05:50] sometimes there's things going on in the
[1:05:52] other realm it is a great battle that is
[1:05:54] going on or god is saying wait be
[1:05:57] patient i've got something greater that
[1:05:59] i'm going to do but here we have an
[1:06:02] incident that was unlike anything else
[1:06:04] that's written in the entire canon of
[1:06:06] scripture and we get our first view into
[1:06:09] a glimpse of a supernatural war the way
[1:06:13] it was going on now notice the angel
[1:06:15] gabriel as he comes to daniel and he
[1:06:17] says from the first day
[1:06:19] that thou didst set thine heart to
[1:06:22] understand and to chasten thyself before
[1:06:25] thy god thy words were heard
[1:06:29] so you imagine daniel saying well if i
[1:06:32] was heard the first day why did it take
[1:06:34] you 21 to get here
[1:06:36] so why did it take 21 days for me
[1:06:40] praying me chastening my soul me before
[1:06:43] god every day crying out to god
[1:06:46] but notice he said thy words were heard
[1:06:49] and i am come
[1:06:51] for
[1:06:52] thy words
[1:06:53] so here is the angel gabriel which ranks
[1:06:56] very highly knowing the economy of god
[1:06:59] and he was sent to daniel and his the
[1:07:01] first thing that he does is bring
[1:07:04] comfort to daniel before he gives him an
[1:07:06] explanation of why there was a delay in
[1:07:09] his prayer now watch now we're going to
[1:07:11] get into the reason why there was a
[1:07:14] delay
[1:07:15] but the prince of the kingdom
[1:07:18] of persia
[1:07:20] withstood me one
[1:07:22] and twenty
[1:07:23] days
[1:07:25] okay so here is the angel gabriel
[1:07:28] telling daniel why there was a delay in
[1:07:32] his prayer the prince of the kingdom
[1:07:36] of persia
[1:07:37] so here is a being that is described as
[1:07:42] a prince
[1:07:43] but we know this was not darius it was
[1:07:47] not cyrus it was not the son
[1:07:50] of cyrus because he was now king
[1:07:53] but it was a prince or a demon
[1:07:57] which had been chosen under the
[1:08:00] hierarchy of satan
[1:08:02] to be the demon that would influence
[1:08:05] this
[1:08:06] great empire
[1:08:08] now you know it might seem a little bit
[1:08:10] odd and peculiar to us and we look at
[1:08:12] politics and we think well it's all
[1:08:15] determined by votes it's all determined
[1:08:17] by this and that who can get the most
[1:08:19] money let me tell you it's not
[1:08:21] determined by that at all
[1:08:23] god is the one
[1:08:25] who will have his sovereignty
[1:08:28] that's right
[1:08:29] now listen this the prince of the
[1:08:32] kingdom of persia
[1:08:33] withstood me one in 20 days now here
[1:08:36] we're talking about the angel gabriel
[1:08:39] which was sent to mary
[1:08:41] the angel gabriel which was sent to
[1:08:43] daniel he's mentioned a few times in the
[1:08:45] bible and we know that he was one of the
[1:08:48] archai or the principal angels that
[1:08:52] stayed in his original position with god
[1:08:55] but this prince of persia we don't know
[1:08:58] his name
[1:08:59] but the prince of persia
[1:09:02] actually outranked gabriel
[1:09:05] in power
[1:09:08] now he was a fallen angel
[1:09:11] but he still maintained
[1:09:13] his hierarchy
[1:09:16] now friends i'm going to tell you
[1:09:17] something there's no way you and i
[1:09:19] are going to be able to face such demons
[1:09:23] if an angel gabriel that never thought a
[1:09:26] bad thought
[1:09:28] never said a bad word never lied never
[1:09:31] stole never cheated never done anything
[1:09:33] wrong
[1:09:34] and yet gabriel could not withstand this
[1:09:38] prince of persia
[1:09:40] how can you and i
[1:09:42] unless
[1:09:44] our champion
[1:09:48] unless our champion
[1:09:51] lives inside of us
[1:09:57] the prince of the kingdom of persia
[1:09:59] which stood in me one and 20 days but lo
[1:10:03] michael and the word michael of course
[1:10:06] means one who is like god and the
[1:10:08] prophet tells us who michael was
[1:10:11] michael was christ
[1:10:14] but lo michael one of the chief now
[1:10:18] notice categorically that this is a
[1:10:21] higher category
[1:10:23] than gabriel or this other prince this
[1:10:26] one is called
[1:10:28] a chief prince
[1:10:30] a chief prince now remember there were
[1:10:33] cherubims seraphims zooms and they were
[1:10:37] all created in a hierarchy by the plan
[1:10:40] of god because god knew before the
[1:10:42] foundation of the world that satan would
[1:10:44] fall he was not created as we know him
[1:10:47] today as diablos or lucifer but he was
[1:10:52] created as the son of the morning this
[1:10:55] is what he was the son of the morning
[1:10:58] one of his names and titles was the day
[1:11:00] star
[1:11:02] so he was the next man right next to god
[1:11:05] question answer in 1959 he was god's
[1:11:08] right-hand man to fellowship
[1:11:11] so when god wanted to fellowship with
[1:11:13] anyone it was with this day star that he
[1:11:17] fellowship as a matter of fact according
[1:11:19] to what the bible tells us in the book
[1:11:21] of isaiah that he was the one that god
[1:11:24] had said thou art the anointed cherub
[1:11:27] and i have set thee soul
[1:11:30] that was created perfect until iniquity
[1:11:33] was found in thee so god did not create
[1:11:36] him the devil but god created him a
[1:11:39] great bright and shining angel as a
[1:11:42] matter of fact he was in charge of the
[1:11:44] music department in heaven this is why
[1:11:47] he uses music today because he said the
[1:11:50] day the tie pipes and harps and tablets
[1:11:55] so he was in charge of music
[1:11:59] these beings once they fell
[1:12:02] they unlike what you and i would think
[1:12:05] that they would lose all of their
[1:12:07] capacity
[1:12:08] all their ability they didn't
[1:12:11] now you think of a devil that would be a
[1:12:14] cold devil now he's a bad devil if
[1:12:16] you've got a bad cold for sure
[1:12:18] but he's nothing like a cancer devil
[1:12:21] and apparently this covet dude is a bad
[1:12:24] devil
[1:12:26] now think about it that there's other
[1:12:28] demons there's only one devil
[1:12:31] that as far as we know that ever got out
[1:12:34] away from the prophet's control
[1:12:36] from time to time
[1:12:38] and that was epilepsy
[1:12:40] now he would tell the parents keep their
[1:12:42] kids near them because that one was
[1:12:44] really stubborn he must have ranked high
[1:12:47] in the hierarchy
[1:12:48] now when satan fell and then he began to
[1:12:50] preach to these other angels
[1:12:53] and they fell with him by their own
[1:12:55] choice and remember there is no
[1:12:57] redemption for angels once they ever
[1:13:00] fall
[1:13:01] the blood wasn't shed for angels it was
[1:13:03] shed for you
[1:13:05] so once angels fall then they fell from
[1:13:08] their hierarchy but they never lost
[1:13:10] their gifts you notice well as i do that
[1:13:13] many of the great country music stars
[1:13:15] and rock and roll stars and many of
[1:13:17] those people where did they get their
[1:13:19] start in church
[1:13:21] so why whenever they backslide don't god
[1:13:24] take their voice why don't god take
[1:13:26] their gift
[1:13:28] so god did not take away the influence
[1:13:31] and the ability
[1:13:32] of these fallen angels to be able to
[1:13:34] influence humanity and even outrank some
[1:13:39] of those angels that never fail
[1:13:42] oh you're listening to me ain't you
[1:13:44] now can you imagine gabriel one that had
[1:13:47] stayed in the presence of god and had
[1:13:50] kept his estate and he comes down now he
[1:13:53] said because daniel is praying asking
[1:13:56] god about what's going on now if you
[1:13:58] know this history you know that someone
[1:14:00] is moving and we know that it was during
[1:14:03] the time of zerubbabel that zerubbabel
[1:14:05] was doing a great work in jerusalem and
[1:14:07] there was something that was moving on
[1:14:10] the samaritans and they were there
[1:14:12] trying to send a message back and forth
[1:14:15] back and forth and they're saying these
[1:14:17] people are nuts over here in jerusalem
[1:14:19] and they're trying to rebel against the
[1:14:21] king well what was going on on the earth
[1:14:24] was only a reflection of what was going
[1:14:27] on in the world that is unseen
[1:14:30] now this prince of persia had been
[1:14:33] chosen for this purpose and that was the
[1:14:36] characteristics and traits of his makeup
[1:14:39] would be that he would be very effective
[1:14:42] under the dominion of the persian
[1:14:45] kingdom but he would not work in the
[1:14:48] next kingdom that was coming
[1:14:50] he would definitely not work in the
[1:14:52] roman kingdom now think of it satan
[1:14:54] knows which demon to send to which
[1:14:57] kingdom i wish somebody would preach
[1:14:59] with me tonight it's the same way with
[1:15:01] you you see our enemy studies us
[1:15:05] he knows our strengths he knows our
[1:15:07] weaknesses he knows our failures it
[1:15:10] would probably scare us tonight if we
[1:15:13] knew how well our enemy knows us
[1:15:17] and when we think that we are in control
[1:15:20] and we go to playing around with little
[1:15:23] sins a little saying oh i've got this
[1:15:25] i'm good i've got it no you haven't no
[1:15:28] you haven't when that devil sees you
[1:15:30] doing that and hears you saying that all
[1:15:33] night it tickles him to death
[1:15:38] notice this michael one of the chief
[1:15:41] princes came to help me now there's one
[1:15:43] thing i do like about this attitude
[1:15:46] about this angel he had no problem in
[1:15:49] admitting that he needed help a lot of
[1:15:52] the message folks you know they really
[1:15:54] do a lot of time they come to the pastor
[1:15:56] time they come to a man of god for
[1:15:58] prayer they've already backslid done
[1:16:00] give up and everything else but at least
[1:16:02] this angel recognized that he needed
[1:16:05] help now we're talking about a being
[1:16:07] that is a said never sin never done
[1:16:09] anything wrong but by the original
[1:16:12] administration that father had given to
[1:16:15] this gabriel he was not given the
[1:16:17] authority you say why would god ever
[1:16:19] send him i don't have a clue you can ask
[1:16:21] him when we get there but god remember
[1:16:23] gabriel is always the messenger to the
[1:16:25] jews so in the high or the hierarchy of
[1:16:29] god according to the divine protocol you
[1:16:32] remember god has a way by which he
[1:16:35] speaks to his people so god is going to
[1:16:38] use the angel gabriel dealing with the
[1:16:40] jews and when gabriel goes he cannot
[1:16:42] break through so he's warring however
[1:16:45] angels would war and the warning
[1:16:47] actually what's going on is it's the
[1:16:49] warring of the politics inside of the
[1:16:52] kingdom so now sympathies which is the
[1:16:55] son of cyrus is now the king and there's
[1:16:58] people inside the kingdom that hate the
[1:17:01] jews now what this prince of persia is
[1:17:03] doing he's playing in the realm of
[1:17:06] politics
[1:17:07] so he's whispering to the king he's
[1:17:09] whispering to all the other people hate
[1:17:12] them jews and them jews are doing this
[1:17:14] and them jews are doing that so the
[1:17:16] prince of persia was warring in the
[1:17:19] court of the king you understand what
[1:17:21] i'm saying but here was the angel
[1:17:23] gabriel and he was warring and he was
[1:17:26] whispering to the king and whispering to
[1:17:29] the magistrates and the delegates no no
[1:17:31] no you need to give them permission to
[1:17:33] go ahead and rebuild the wall and to do
[1:17:35] this and doing that and these mortals
[1:17:38] were caught in between the two voices
[1:17:41] they were hearing the voice of the
[1:17:43] prince of persia and they were hearing
[1:17:46] the voice of gabriel but they themselves
[1:17:48] not being spiritual not even knowing
[1:17:50] where it's come from don't you
[1:17:51] understand why the greatest battle
[1:17:53] that's ever been fought is in our mind
[1:17:56] here we set tonight as the people of god
[1:17:59] my if all of our thoughts could be
[1:18:01] displayed on this great big screen
[1:18:03] behind us there wouldn't be enough
[1:18:04] people in here to work what might even
[1:18:06] turn off the lights i get in 10 minutes
[1:18:08] with it you imagine all the thoughts has
[1:18:11] come through our mind this week but yet
[1:18:13] a real child of god knows from your
[1:18:15] heart no impure nothing defiled nothing
[1:18:20] comes out of your heart but pure genuine
[1:18:23] holiness if you've got the new burst the
[1:18:25] true baptism of the holy ghost but
[1:18:27] remember your mind is that battleground
[1:18:29] satan will bombard you with his thoughts
[1:18:32] and god bombards you with his thoughts
[1:18:36] and any battlefield it's got great cater
[1:18:39] oh my it's got holes everywhere and it's
[1:18:42] blowed here and blowed there that's why
[1:18:44] sometimes it feels like we're about to
[1:18:46] lose our mind why because the battle is
[1:18:50] raging i mean it knows what i'm
[1:18:51] preaching about tonight but as the
[1:18:53] people of god we have the ability to
[1:18:56] cast down imagination and cast down
[1:19:00] everything that exalts itself against
[1:19:03] the knowledge of god and bringing into
[1:19:06] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:19:10] of jesus christ
[1:19:14] oh my
[1:19:16] michael one of the chief princes came to
[1:19:18] help me and i remained there with the
[1:19:21] kings
[1:19:22] or the royal family
[1:19:25] of persia
[1:19:27] now what's here gabriel is giving this
[1:19:30] insight to daniel so daniel can
[1:19:31] understand so now he's finally released
[1:19:35] and he's able to move because michael
[1:19:38] has overpowered this prince of persia
[1:19:42] then whenever michael overpowered him it
[1:19:45] released gabriel and gabriel was able to
[1:19:47] come down and stand on the river hit a
[1:19:49] kill and as he stood there in the gold
[1:19:52] and all that he saw about him and the
[1:19:54] great angelic appearance it must have
[1:19:55] been to him but what was it that made
[1:19:58] this way for him to do this it was
[1:20:02] israel's spiritual
[1:20:04] champion
[1:20:06] now gabriel is a great angel he's a
[1:20:08] mighty angel got a great anointing but
[1:20:11] it was not him that was able to break
[1:20:13] through
[1:20:14] thank god for men of god thank god for
[1:20:17] every true prophet that's been down
[1:20:19] through time thank god for every true
[1:20:21] pastor every songwriter every song
[1:20:23] leader but let me tell you something we
[1:20:25] have only had one mighty champion
[1:20:28] that would be able to look at death that
[1:20:31] be able to look at the grave hallelujah
[1:20:33] and say take my life from me and in
[1:20:36] three days i will raise it up
[1:20:40] moses couldn't say that john couldn't
[1:20:43] say that peter couldn't say that brother
[1:20:46] brown couldn't say that but our champion
[1:20:50] hallelujah the lord jesus could say
[1:20:53] hallelujah amen death and hell give way
[1:20:59] give way
[1:21:08] you remember when brother branham tells
[1:21:10] us about the
[1:21:11] maniac in oregon
[1:21:13] they come and challenged him
[1:21:16] and he
[1:21:18] walked up on the platform threatened to
[1:21:19] break everyone in his body and all that
[1:21:21] you remember the child just briefed it
[1:21:22] but brother baby said what happened was
[1:21:26] that the chief
[1:21:28] of that tribe of demons
[1:21:32] the chief
[1:21:34] of that tribe of demons
[1:21:36] made a challenge to the holy ghost
[1:21:40] and the holy ghost accepted the
[1:21:41] challenge
[1:21:46] yes sir
[1:21:51] now whenever it happened you remember
[1:21:53] the story that the man laid across his
[1:21:55] feet and they come and ask him said is
[1:21:56] he delivered said no
[1:21:58] he worships that spirit
[1:22:02] he worships that spirit number other
[1:22:03] brahman said whenever the spirit of god
[1:22:05] began to move in there everybody in the
[1:22:07] building was healed of course except for
[1:22:09] the man that was the closest to the
[1:22:11] prophet
[1:22:12] now this man is laying across his feet
[1:22:15] and got nothing
[1:22:19] and there were more my cripples and
[1:22:21] blind and whatever more and some of them
[1:22:24] sitting in the back of the auditorium
[1:22:25] and setting up wherever more but yet
[1:22:28] whenever faith rose to that spot why
[1:22:30] that chief of that tribe of demons made
[1:22:33] a challenge and the holy ghost said i
[1:22:36] will accept your challenge let me tell
[1:22:38] you something friend we didn't come here
[1:22:40] tonight to play games we've got come
[1:22:43] here tonight to play church
[1:22:45] if the devil wants to make a challenge
[1:22:47] our holy ghost will accept it
[1:22:50] hallelujah our holy ghost will accept
[1:22:53] his talents
[1:22:55] if he wants to say we are defeated our
[1:22:58] holy ghost will say no my bride is not
[1:23:02] defeated
[1:23:03] she is more than a conference
[1:23:12] hallelujah
[1:23:21] i'm not going to say that
[1:23:22] and you better not
[1:23:26] the devil wants to challenge me
[1:23:28] i tell him to talk to my brother
[1:23:33] my champion
[1:23:35] i've got a champion it ain't me it ain't
[1:23:37] these brothers i love all these brothers
[1:23:39] i love yeah i love them all but they're
[1:23:41] not my champion
[1:23:42] when i was lost i didn't need one of
[1:23:44] these guys to come and find me i needed
[1:23:47] a champion if you said you're not
[1:23:49] battling cancer you don't need just a
[1:23:51] preacher you need a cancer champion
[1:23:54] hallelujah
[1:23:56] if you're bound with something in your
[1:23:58] life you need a champion
[1:24:03] glory to
[1:24:11] god hallelujah
[1:24:28] notice this in verse 20
[1:24:31] of daniel chapter 10
[1:24:33] then said he knowest thou wherefore i
[1:24:36] come unto thee
[1:24:38] and now will i return
[1:24:42] to fight
[1:24:53] i like that grit don't you
[1:24:56] now he needed help before who who among
[1:24:59] us don't
[1:25:03] i will return to fight
[1:25:06] with the prince of persia and when i am
[1:25:08] gone forth love
[1:25:11] the prince
[1:25:13] of gracia
[1:25:14] shall come so here we're getting close
[1:25:18] to where this empire is going to end and
[1:25:21] another is going to begin not a carry
[1:25:23] over the same demon
[1:25:25] but a different demon has been chosen
[1:25:31] and i will show thee that which is noted
[1:25:33] in the scripture of truth
[1:25:36] there is none that hold us with me in
[1:25:40] these things
[1:25:42] but michael
[1:25:44] your prince
[1:25:48] hallelujah
[1:25:50] we all know we have an adversary
[1:25:53] and we can give him credit for it he is
[1:25:55] a good one
[1:25:57] he knows how to fight
[1:25:58] come on you can say amen to that
[1:26:01] he's one that has been doing this for
[1:26:03] thousands of years some of y'all 18 20
[1:26:06] 25 65 70 whatever you are
[1:26:09] but you're talking about an adversary
[1:26:12] that has been doing this for over 6
[1:26:15] 000 years
[1:26:19] he knows every he knows every
[1:26:22] my every trick
[1:26:24] every deceptive means
[1:26:27] well you say how in the world could we
[1:26:29] do it we cannot
[1:26:30] you say why are you preaching us so weak
[1:26:32] i want you to realize how weak you are i
[1:26:35] want you to realize how helpless and how
[1:26:37] hopeless that we are
[1:26:39] and let me tell you something it ain't
[1:26:41] enough to come to a great message church
[1:26:43] it ain't enough to listen to tapes every
[1:26:45] now and then and read your bible it
[1:26:47] ain't enough to be identified well i
[1:26:48] believe brother branham was a prophet
[1:26:50] the devil believes the same thing
[1:26:52] we've got to be born again
[1:26:55] we've got to have the true baptism of
[1:26:57] the holy ghost i'm not just talking
[1:26:59] about something that'll make us shout or
[1:27:02] make us cry i'm talking about something
[1:27:04] when hell is broke loose all around you
[1:27:07] and you cry and you pray and it seems
[1:27:09] like god won't move that you stand right
[1:27:12] there and say devil out of my way you're
[1:27:15] not tying me down you're not stopping me
[1:27:18] hallelujah greater is he that is in me
[1:27:23] than he that is in the world you may be
[1:27:26] greater than me greater than these
[1:27:28] preachers that you're not greater than
[1:27:30] my champion my champion jesus christ
[1:27:34] defeated you
[1:27:50] read with me in first peter chapter 5
[1:27:53] verse 8
[1:27:55] be sober
[1:27:58] be vigilant
[1:28:00] because your adversary the devil
[1:28:04] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[1:28:09] whom he may devour who better
[1:28:11] than peter
[1:28:13] to know about the prowess
[1:28:16] of satan
[1:28:19] remember him standing up there
[1:28:21] saying lord if everybody forsakes you
[1:28:23] i'll go
[1:28:25] hallelujah
[1:28:27] our god
[1:28:31] he didn't want to hear what jesus had to
[1:28:32] say
[1:28:33] before the crows you'll deny that
[1:28:35] you even know him he probably didn't
[1:28:36] even believe it
[1:28:38] just like some of you don't she said no
[1:28:40] the ministry of pro for pastors that
[1:28:42] love you with all their heart and they
[1:28:44] keep trying no i'm no i'm good i'm good
[1:28:46] i'm good you know what god has to let us
[1:28:47] happen to us sometimes because of our
[1:28:49] hard-hittedness we have to fall flat on
[1:28:52] our face
[1:28:56] several times jesus warned him
[1:28:58] simon simon
[1:29:01] satan hath desired that he may have you
[1:29:05] that he may sift you
[1:29:07] as
[1:29:08] sweet but i have prayed for you
[1:29:12] that your faith
[1:29:14] will not fail you now peter did but his
[1:29:17] faith did
[1:29:20] some of you may have failed god over and
[1:29:21] over again but the same lord jesus that
[1:29:24] prayed for peter has prayed for the rest
[1:29:26] of his brother
[1:29:28] and his prayers will be answered
[1:29:30] lord hallelujah he didn't just pray for
[1:29:34] peter he is your intercessor brother
[1:29:37] sister
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:43] notice this
[1:29:44] matthew 26 40 cometh unto the disciples
[1:29:47] and find them asleep
[1:29:49] it says unto peter what could you not
[1:29:52] watch with me one hour
[1:29:56] watch and pray
[1:29:57] lest you enter not into temptation the
[1:29:59] spirit indeed is willing but the flesh
[1:30:03] is weak
[1:30:05] oh how many times did peter remember
[1:30:08] that later oh why did i do it why did i
[1:30:11] do it because it wasn't born again
[1:30:14] he was a preacher turned out to be a
[1:30:15] cussing preacher
[1:30:18] praise the lord a naked preacher out
[1:30:21] there fishing naked i never have
[1:30:22] understood that what in the world
[1:30:25] i don't tell what you'll do without the
[1:30:27] holy ghost
[1:30:28] well come on that's the bible
[1:30:31] it's not enough for him to be identified
[1:30:33] around this message the message must be
[1:30:36] inside of us
[1:30:38] it'll keep you when you cannot keep
[1:30:40] yourself it will pulsate something on
[1:30:43] the inside of you that emotion boy i
[1:30:45] love emotion i love anointing i love
[1:30:48] feeling it from the top of my head to
[1:30:49] the bottom of my feet but i love it when
[1:30:52] i've got a tie post in my soul when i
[1:30:54] can't feel nothing at all and it still
[1:30:57] ties me to that rock christ jesus the
[1:31:00] prophet of god said to make your
[1:31:02] absolute a
[1:31:04] christ-centered life
[1:31:06] a
[1:31:07] christ-centered life
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:16] again peter says be sober
[1:31:19] the word sober
[1:31:21] ma
[1:31:22] it's to avoid drunkenness
[1:31:25] of your senses
[1:31:27] drunkenness in your souls
[1:31:30] be sober
[1:31:32] and vigilant to watch the word sober
[1:31:35] again means to be calm collected in
[1:31:38] spirit
[1:31:40] to govern both the outward and the
[1:31:43] inward man by rules of temperaments
[1:31:47] modesty and mortification
[1:31:51] cares can intoxicate the soul
[1:31:55] this is where most laodiceans are
[1:31:59] drunk
[1:32:00] on the cares of this world
[1:32:04] but peter says be sober
[1:32:06] and be vigilant vigilantes watch wait
[1:32:09] metaphorically give strict attention to
[1:32:12] be cautious
[1:32:14] active
[1:32:15] to take heed lest through remission
[1:32:18] or carelessness that's why brother
[1:32:20] brandman said over and over again it's
[1:32:21] not the great big things that you do
[1:32:23] some little things that you leave undone
[1:32:28] now remember who our enemy is
[1:32:31] these demons
[1:32:33] these are the same ones that anointed
[1:32:35] sodom
[1:32:37] these are the same ones and the
[1:32:39] andeluvian destruction that god owned
[1:32:41] the people this is the same ones that
[1:32:44] moses did with the very talking about
[1:32:47] experience
[1:32:49] there's no way we can do this
[1:32:52] without a champion
[1:32:55] i don't know about you i'm going to be
[1:32:57] standing in this last day
[1:32:59] i want to be one of those that's going
[1:33:00] to be faithful to the end anybody else
[1:33:04] i don't want a t-shirt at the end of the
[1:33:05] way to say i survived laodicea
[1:33:08] i'm going to be an overcomer
[1:33:10] i want to be one of the sons of god
[1:33:12] that's going to overcome
[1:33:14] in this evil age i'm not just going to
[1:33:16] survive i believe that a child of god i
[1:33:19] simply believe what the prophet said
[1:33:21] that a person can live so close to god
[1:33:24] that the devil don't know what to do
[1:33:26] with you
[1:33:27] can you imagine how it ought to be for
[1:33:29] every holy ghost field child of god here
[1:33:31] today that when you get up out of the
[1:33:33] bed in the morning and you set your feet
[1:33:35] down on the floor that them demons gonna
[1:33:37] say lord god here they come oh oh no
[1:33:41] oh whoa
[1:33:44] she lived another day
[1:33:47] he lived another day hallelujah
[1:33:50] why because we are the god of the people
[1:33:54] of god
[1:33:56] we cannot be defeated friends
[1:34:00] we are made out of stuff that don't
[1:34:02] bluff
[1:34:16] hallelujah
[1:34:18] when you hate to be the type of
[1:34:19] christian that down in hell
[1:34:22] whenever your name is mentioned then
[1:34:23] demons say
[1:34:29] if people only knew them the way i did
[1:34:34] and satan said all right it's time for a
[1:34:35] shift change
[1:34:37] i want i want this demon away from this
[1:34:39] house and that one who wants to go over
[1:34:41] that other house you imagine the demons
[1:34:42] i will
[1:34:44] i will
[1:34:47] but for me i want to be the type of
[1:34:49] believer whenever a shift change is
[1:34:51] required for reagan hard
[1:34:55] i know you've heard it before
[1:34:57] but when satan says i need somebody to
[1:35:00] go up to the reagan home then devils go
[1:35:02] to driving handkerchiefs they're going
[1:35:04] to grab bath tails and they're going to
[1:35:06] balding like a rat eating onions i'm
[1:35:08] telling you what they crying and crying
[1:35:10] they support you please don't give me
[1:35:12] your
[1:35:13] send me up there please don't send me to
[1:35:15] her house please don't send me to her
[1:35:18] house that's the kind of testimony
[1:35:20] hallelujah that we want down in hell
[1:35:24] that we're not just talkers but we are
[1:35:27] possessors of this world we're
[1:35:30] possessors of jesus christ
[1:35:34] we take our stand
[1:35:37] hallelujah
[1:35:38] we will not
[1:35:40] bow we will not give him
[1:35:44] we will not compromise
[1:35:59] [Applause]
[1:36:05] you see it ain't hard to rejoice in the
[1:36:07] anointings like this way
[1:36:12] but next week
[1:36:14] you ain't feeling it
[1:36:16] you still want to have the same
[1:36:17] determination that you got tonight
[1:36:20] if you're just emotion and you're worked
[1:36:22] up under everybody else's gift and
[1:36:23] everybody else's influence won't do much
[1:36:25] good
[1:36:27] but when all hell is breaking loose all
[1:36:28] around you
[1:36:30] you want to stand right there and say me
[1:36:31] and my champion will take all of
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:37] oh y'all
[1:36:44] you'll imagine david said in psalms 27
[1:36:47] remember the prophet read that song for
[1:36:49] a background
[1:36:52] for the rapture
[1:36:53] really sometimes you'll understand why
[1:36:56] david said though a
[1:36:58] whole host comes against me
[1:37:01] i will not be afraid
[1:37:04] imagine david was under him going out in
[1:37:06] the woods out of the wilderness and he
[1:37:07] got up one morning going out there
[1:37:09] stretching you know just woke up got up
[1:37:11] walked down he looked around on every
[1:37:13] hillside was an enemy
[1:37:15] david looked up at him and said you just
[1:37:18] signed your death lord
[1:37:22] hallelujah thou a host come against me i
[1:37:26] will not be afraid for the lord is my
[1:37:30] life and the strength of my life of whom
[1:37:33] shall i fear
[1:37:35] yes we're not afraid of death
[1:37:38] disease we're not afraid of it
[1:37:41] oh no
[1:37:42] hell no
[1:37:44] our champion conquered all
[1:37:48] glory to god
[1:38:04] peter described him this way and said be
[1:38:06] sober be vigilant
[1:38:08] because your adversary
[1:38:10] the devil and the word adversary
[1:38:13] literally means
[1:38:14] your opponent
[1:38:16] in a court
[1:38:18] of justice
[1:38:23] your opponent
[1:38:25] in a court of justice why you think the
[1:38:26] bible calls him an accuser of the
[1:38:30] brethren
[1:38:33] and the lord knows that we give him
[1:38:35] enough evidence against us
[1:38:38] come on i don't sit there and look like
[1:38:39] you
[1:38:42] i didn't see no angel wings racks
[1:38:44] hanging out there for you folks to hang
[1:38:45] up your angel wings you're like all the
[1:38:48] rest of us
[1:38:49] you're immortal
[1:38:51] you got your weaknesses your failures
[1:38:53] your shortcomings
[1:38:56] a lot of us did the devil don't have to
[1:38:57] make up anything all he's got to do just
[1:38:59] see what he sees every day
[1:39:01] well come on now
[1:39:04] so what does he do he's our adversary
[1:39:08] and this is what peter addressed it and
[1:39:10] said no my because your adversary the
[1:39:15] devil
[1:39:16] we should constantly be alert
[1:39:19] that diablos
[1:39:22] this is what the word satan and the
[1:39:23] greek is diablos
[1:39:26] slanderer
[1:39:30] slanderer
[1:39:32] is always actively seeking an
[1:39:34] opportunity
[1:39:36] to bring a charge against you
[1:39:42] notice how peter describes it
[1:39:45] he says as
[1:39:46] a roaring
[1:39:48] lion
[1:39:50] now he doesn't say that he is one
[1:39:54] but he's has one
[1:39:56] which means he's an impersonator
[1:40:01] remember the bow with no errors
[1:40:05] as a ring why would he want to be that
[1:40:07] way because god of course is as a lion
[1:40:11] so here the enemy wants to impersonate
[1:40:14] himself as a roaring lion so called
[1:40:17] because of the account of his strengths
[1:40:20] and tenacity
[1:40:22] by which he challenges us
[1:40:25] that's one thing we've got to give him
[1:40:26] credit for
[1:40:28] us preachers tear the heart off of him
[1:40:31] if we blasted you
[1:40:33] one-third as much as we blast the devil
[1:40:36] some of you would never come back
[1:40:38] we call him a liar we blast him to his
[1:40:40] face we cast him out every time we get a
[1:40:43] chance we say he's going to hell we say
[1:40:46] he's evil and he's rotten he's the most
[1:40:48] faithful member i've got and the most
[1:40:50] faithful member here as well
[1:40:52] he comes every service he ain't good for
[1:40:54] nothing he don't pay no ties he don't
[1:40:55] help take up the you know just to take
[1:40:57] up the slack he's really good for
[1:40:59] nothing but he's here all the time if
[1:41:01] you were treated that way you'd be so
[1:41:03] discouraged you'd never come back but he
[1:41:06] keeps on coming back we knock him down
[1:41:08] he gets up we knock him down he gets up
[1:41:10] but we're gonna have the last knock and
[1:41:12] he won't get back up
[1:41:15] hallelujah
[1:41:17] hallelujah
[1:41:19] i as a roaring lion
[1:41:30] notice peter doesn't say
[1:41:32] he's a sleeping man
[1:41:35] not lying sleep about 20 hours a day i'm
[1:41:38] talking about in a while
[1:41:39] about 20 hours a day
[1:41:42] so they don't really do a whole lot now
[1:41:43] we know that the lion is the king we
[1:41:45] know all that but yet in reality he's a
[1:41:48] pretty sorry outfit
[1:41:50] i'm talking about the male he doesn't do
[1:41:52] most of the killing the females doing
[1:41:54] the pride
[1:41:55] and then whenever he hears something
[1:41:57] dying you know carrying on that he'll
[1:41:59] come over there and take the kill
[1:42:02] away from them
[1:42:04] yeah look at satan in his church and you
[1:42:06] say it's exactly the way he is he takes
[1:42:08] the kill away from them and then he eats
[1:42:10] till he's full and then he'll give
[1:42:12] whatever's left to the rest of the
[1:42:14] lionesses and the cubs
[1:42:17] and yet peter likened him so he's not a
[1:42:20] sleeping lion
[1:42:22] or a lion that's just laying back and
[1:42:24] doing this thing and you know whenever a
[1:42:25] lion is not really hungry they will go
[1:42:28] i've been to the to the africa several
[1:42:30] times and across the plains of the
[1:42:32] serengeti and it's amazing where the
[1:42:34] cheetah with the leopard within the big
[1:42:36] cats whenever they're going across the
[1:42:37] plains of the serengeti wherever they
[1:42:39] are and they've got their tail bent back
[1:42:41] over their back like this
[1:42:44] there can be impala wildebeest all kinds
[1:42:46] of animals out there and they'll wash
[1:42:48] them they'll keep their eye on them but
[1:42:50] they're not afraid of them you know why
[1:42:52] it's a sign they're not hunting
[1:42:55] they're not hunting but whenever they're
[1:42:57] hunting they won't see them
[1:43:01] now this is the way he does you
[1:43:04] so you're looking for this great big old
[1:43:06] guy with this big old mane and these big
[1:43:08] old paws uh-uh that ain't the way he's
[1:43:10] going to get you he's going to be hiding
[1:43:13] he's going to be watching for your
[1:43:15] weakness watching for this and watching
[1:43:17] for that
[1:43:19] several years ago i was in the messiah
[1:43:21] morrow a gigantic game park there in
[1:43:23] kenya one of the brothers in the message
[1:43:24] that was there and he took us out and i
[1:43:26] saw a very strange thing it was a female
[1:43:28] lioness and she was laying up upon an
[1:43:30] ant mound and it was maybe about this
[1:43:32] high something like that right out in
[1:43:34] the plane open so that was jim's butt
[1:43:36] that was impala uh willoughby scooted
[1:43:38] just all kinds of different animals and
[1:43:40] i thought it was so odd and so unusual
[1:43:43] that she was laying right out there in
[1:43:45] the open so i said brother why is is she
[1:43:48] laying there he said she is a decoy
[1:43:53] i said a decoy said yeah he said let me
[1:43:55] let me look so he started looking
[1:43:56] looking looking and he found the rest of
[1:43:59] the pride and they were coming through
[1:44:01] the tall grass
[1:44:02] so all the impala all the rest of the
[1:44:05] animals had their eyes on the decoy and
[1:44:08] the others were moving up all around
[1:44:11] them
[1:44:12] well come on now children
[1:44:14] come on now oh we're scared to death of
[1:44:17] communism and we're scared to death of
[1:44:19] this and that and the other that ain't
[1:44:21] nothing but a decoy the prophet told us
[1:44:23] whenever he was here oh it ain't that
[1:44:25] iron curtain it's that purple one
[1:44:28] come on now even this message folks have
[1:44:31] got our eyes off of that purple one
[1:44:33] seems right but that's the one we need
[1:44:35] to be watching what is this other stuff
[1:44:37] that ain't nothing but a decoy satan
[1:44:40] will put decoys in your life and you're
[1:44:42] looking you're scared to death of that
[1:44:44] and you're scared to death of that and
[1:44:46] the very thing you ought to be aware of
[1:44:48] is moving right up behind you and it's
[1:44:50] trying to steal your children it's time
[1:44:53] to steal your joy it's time to steal the
[1:44:55] walk with god oh hallelujah but we need
[1:44:59] to realize our champion has given us
[1:45:03] power we are lying killers
[1:45:07] oh grower we are lying killers
[1:45:26] my wife and i carol sitting here
[1:45:28] was in johannesburg several years ago
[1:45:30] and the brother there
[1:45:32] wanted to do us a really nice treat so
[1:45:35] we got in at night it was late when we
[1:45:37] got there
[1:45:38] we drove and drove and drove we're
[1:45:39] taking us to the place where we're going
[1:45:41] to stay we didn't know where it was
[1:45:42] so we checked into a place look kind of
[1:45:44] primitive
[1:45:46] we checked in we got into this place and
[1:45:48] it was a thatched type roof
[1:45:52] so we didn't know exactly where we were
[1:45:55] but maybe two three o'clock in the
[1:45:57] morning
[1:45:58] something started going
[1:46:07] i don't mind telling you that little
[1:46:09] wife of mine
[1:46:11] was
[1:46:13] glued to me
[1:46:18] has there been anybody else in the bed
[1:46:20] i've been glued to them probably
[1:46:24] because it was so scary
[1:46:27] now what you've seen in the atlanta zoo
[1:46:29] and what you've seen in those three
[1:46:30] reports you forget it that's not a real
[1:46:31] specimen of the lie
[1:46:33] and the way people want to paint the
[1:46:34] devil to you is some little weakling
[1:46:36] something no he is a real devil he is a
[1:46:40] prince but we've got power over him
[1:46:45] hallelujah we've got power young people
[1:46:48] you cannot meet him on your own but with
[1:46:51] jesus inside of you there is no
[1:46:54] temptation there is no rust there is no
[1:46:57] pornography there is no sin that can
[1:47:01] defeat you and hold your life unless you
[1:47:05] allow it to
[1:47:24] the problem was
[1:47:25] the brother had put us in a game park
[1:47:30] but carol and i didn't know that there
[1:47:31] was a big fence right on the outside of
[1:47:33] our room
[1:47:35] it sounded like the line was in the next
[1:47:36] one to us
[1:47:41] oh my on and on and on he went
[1:47:46] the next morning we were awakened by
[1:47:48] monkeys on the roof
[1:47:50] so then i get up i'm gonna go outside
[1:47:52] and just right there is this fence but
[1:47:54] it's 15 20 feet tall
[1:47:57] i thought
[1:47:59] if i don't know that
[1:48:00] i could have slept like a baby
[1:48:04] why
[1:48:05] he couldn't get to me
[1:48:07] [Applause]
[1:48:11] oh he'll roar and he'll roar and he'll
[1:48:15] scare you and he'll scare you but
[1:48:18] brother sister you can sleep like a baby
[1:48:22] lord of god you are sealed by the holy
[1:48:26] ghost and that devil cannot get you
[1:48:30] if you're sealed in god
[1:48:44] oh my god
[1:48:48] notice david in psalms 17 12 said locke
[1:48:52] as a lion
[1:48:54] that is greedy
[1:48:56] of his prey
[1:48:58] and he said we're a young lion lurking
[1:49:02] in secret places
[1:49:07] you see the lion does not roar
[1:49:10] when he hunts
[1:49:15] he only roars
[1:49:17] when he's in attack mode
[1:49:20] now he'll be so close or the females
[1:49:23] and when they get so close
[1:49:25] then
[1:49:26] is when they'll make the noise
[1:49:28] everything else
[1:49:29] is stealth mode
[1:49:41] you don't even know it
[1:49:43] no that's on you
[1:49:46] but if you got the holy ghost
[1:49:48] you got a built-in buzzer
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:49:56] it gives you a warning something ain't
[1:49:57] right
[1:49:58] something how many knows what i'm
[1:49:59] talking about aren't you glad for the
[1:50:01] holy ghost that has warned you time and
[1:50:04] time and time again thank god for the
[1:50:06] blood when we mess up but thank god for
[1:50:09] the holy ghost that stops us from
[1:50:11] messing up before we ever mess up
[1:50:14] i think that teaches us the tactics of
[1:50:18] our enemies
[1:50:26] watch this peter goes on to say so be
[1:50:28] sober be vigilant
[1:50:30] because your adversary the devil is a
[1:50:32] roaring lion
[1:50:34] walk us
[1:50:35] about
[1:50:40] seeking whom
[1:50:43] he
[1:50:44] may
[1:50:46] devour
[1:50:50] remember in the book of job
[1:50:52] chapter 1 verse 7 the lord said unto
[1:50:54] satan once cometh now
[1:50:57] then satan answered the lord and said
[1:50:59] from going to and fro
[1:51:01] in the earth
[1:51:03] and from walking up and down in it
[1:51:07] what's he hunting for pray
[1:51:14] let me tell you something whether you're
[1:51:15] young or old here tonight
[1:51:18] there is nothing he's more proud of
[1:51:21] than a trophy
[1:51:23] on his wall
[1:51:24] of a young man or a young woman that
[1:51:26] said in a message church
[1:51:29] or an older man or older woman who said
[1:51:31] in a message
[1:51:32] church oh i've got many trophies i've
[1:51:35] been able to hunt in different parts of
[1:51:36] the world and every one of them has a
[1:51:38] story yeah every one of them's got a
[1:51:40] story well that one there that's a
[1:51:42] fallow deer it run me up a tree up in
[1:51:44] north carolina truth run me up a tree
[1:51:46] and it was i dropped my gun going up the
[1:51:48] tree and the deer was down at the bottom
[1:51:50] of the of the tree chewing on my strap
[1:51:52] and i thought lucky me he'll probably
[1:51:54] shoot me out of the tree
[1:51:57] so nearly every one of them have a story
[1:52:00] but can you imagine on satan's den room
[1:52:03] wall
[1:52:06] oh yeah let's see that in there
[1:52:07] that's a pastor's daughter
[1:52:10] see that in there
[1:52:12] she was born and raised in church
[1:52:14] look at that one oh remember him in
[1:52:16] center part and shout and jump around
[1:52:18] glory to god hallelujah
[1:52:20] now they don't even think there's a god
[1:52:25] why
[1:52:26] not sealed
[1:52:29] the champion the champion look for the
[1:52:32] champion is not your knowledge of the
[1:52:33] message the champion is not your ability
[1:52:36] to quote the word please don't
[1:52:37] misunderstand me your champion is not
[1:52:39] even your pastor you must have an
[1:52:41] individual walk with god you must have a
[1:52:44] sore a christ-centered life that you if

[1:58:27] that if he just starts taking the lid
[1:58:29] off of your bottle you say

[1:58:53] the power of god
[1:58:54] hallelujah i cannot go put him down
[1:59:08] oh
[1:59:23] notice this
[1:59:24] brother bim said a lion is a fierce
[1:59:26] animal
[1:59:27] an africable is hunting them a lion can
[1:59:30] kill 10 men
[1:59:33] before you can say jack robinson
[1:59:37] now what that means i don't have a clue
[1:59:40] but all i know is it can kill 10 men
[1:59:42] faster than you can say jack robinson
[1:59:46] powerful great beast just like a big
[1:59:48] roar
[1:59:49] and men are consuming the one who dies
[1:59:52] under the power of a lion never feels
[1:59:55] any hurt
[1:59:57] it's such a scare to hear that roar
[2:00:00] that he gives those great mammoth feet
[2:00:02] just in a second he's tore down a dozen
[2:00:06] men
[2:00:11] we don't want to get worked up in this
[2:00:13] meeting
[2:00:14] with just work up alone
[2:00:18] we want some equipment
[2:00:24] oh yeah we want to work up that's right
[2:00:34] going to have a couple more minutes
[2:00:37] satan temps
[2:00:39] under three forms
[2:00:42] the subtle serpent
[2:00:45] to beguile our senses
[2:00:47] pervert our judgment
[2:00:52] and enchant
[2:00:53] our imagination
[2:00:56] remember every day of your life you got
[2:00:58] 10 gates against you
[2:01:01] right
[2:01:02] imagination conscience memory reason and
[2:01:04] affection see taste feel smelling here
[2:01:07] you got 10 gates
[2:01:09] against one
[2:01:11] your soul
[2:01:14] as an angel of light
[2:01:17] to deceive with false views even of
[2:01:20] spiritual things
[2:01:23] so he comes as a subtle serpent or as an
[2:01:26] angel of light
[2:01:28] or a line
[2:01:30] if he can't talk you into something
[2:01:32] he'll try to scare you into something
[2:01:35] well so and so fell and they were closer
[2:01:37] to god than you are they were a much
[2:01:39] better person than you are look i'm not
[2:01:41] making so and so my example
[2:01:44] come on now you know as well as i do
[2:01:46] that satan will do that to everyone well
[2:01:48] look at yourself so and so did this so

[2:01:56] that we can put our eyes on as our
[2:01:58] example and that's the lord jesus
[2:02:01] don't make no man no ma'am you're
[2:02:04] heavenly example there's only one let me
[2:02:06] set this i hope you don't understand it
[2:02:08] i put my ultimate complete confidence in
[2:02:11] no individual no man i don't care how
[2:02:14] good they are they are still human

[2:02:21] trust my ultimate confidence my ultimate
[2:02:24] faith in and that's the lord jesus
[2:02:27] christ
[2:02:28] well praise the lord why because he is
[2:02:32] not only the mighty conqueror whenever
[2:02:34] daniel was needing an answer from the
[2:02:36] lord and gabriel couldn't bring it to it
[2:02:38] who knows how many other angels were
[2:02:40] there involved and they didn't know what
[2:02:42] to do but what happened a mighty one
[2:02:45] came down the covenant angel hallelujah
[2:02:48] he came down and strengthened gabriel
[2:02:51] and he was able to come why because he
[2:02:53] was the champion of israel let me tell
[2:02:55] you something we were in a worse dilemma
[2:02:57] we were born lost with a sinful nature
[2:03:00] out of the economy of god far from the
[2:03:02] commonwealth of god it seemed we were
[2:03:04] helpless and hopeless we were lost
[2:03:06] without god most of us weren't even
[2:03:08] seeking god we didn't want god we didn't
[2:03:11] want church we didn't want no bible but
[2:03:13] it wasn't that you wanted god it's that
[2:03:16] god wanted you
[2:03:17] [Applause]
[2:03:19] oh
[2:03:20] my you say well i just can't take it no
[2:03:23] more i think i'm gonna quit tell me this
[2:03:26] how can you stop something you never
[2:03:28] started you never started your salvation
[2:03:32] you never started your eternal life you
[2:03:34] never started your election but god
[2:03:37] started you before the foundation of the
[2:03:40] world before there was ever a moon or a
[2:03:42] star or a sun you were in his mind you
[2:03:46] were part of this bride before the world
[2:03:49] began and let satan roar let him do what
[2:03:53] he's going to do that we are
[2:03:55] undeceivable
[2:03:57] we are the army of the living god
[2:04:07] hallelujah
[2:04:20] hallelujah
[2:04:24] hallelujah
[2:04:27] many of you no doubt have heard the
[2:04:28] stories of the lines of darkness
[2:04:31] that was going to build a bridge in
[2:04:32] africa in the 1900s
[2:04:35] this
[2:04:36] particular line they kept trying to trap
[2:04:39] it trying to kill it
[2:04:40] they just couldn't do it then another
[2:04:42] one would come
[2:04:43] these wines were so savage they would
[2:04:46] come in and
[2:04:47] pull servants out out of the tents at
[2:04:50] night
[2:04:51] it was unbelievable then this line set
[2:04:53] its goal on this one particular man an
[2:04:56] engineer or bridge builder
[2:04:58] it was almost as if they were demonic
[2:05:01] anointed
[2:05:02] they hunted and they hunted got up in a
[2:05:04] tree done all sorts of things to try to
[2:05:06] find it finally they found a lair or a
[2:05:09] den
[2:05:10] when they got in there they found skulls
[2:05:13] of humans
[2:05:14] they found feet bones they found hand
[2:05:16] bones they found all kinds of things
[2:05:20] and satan loves to scare you and i
[2:05:23] with such things look at so-and-so
