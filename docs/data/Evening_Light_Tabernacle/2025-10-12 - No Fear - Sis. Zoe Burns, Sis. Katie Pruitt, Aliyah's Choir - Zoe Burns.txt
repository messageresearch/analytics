TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] [music] [music] [music] I got enemies on every side. Ain't looking good. I ain't going to [music and singing] lie. Arrows flying, devils trying to make me think I'm going down this time. [music] You might think that I'd be afraid. Running scared with a shaking faith, but the God I know says it ain't over. The God I [singing] know is going to make a way. [music] Yay. Though I walk [singing] through the valley, I [singing] will have no fear. No [music] fear, no fear. The mighty [music] power of Jesus [singing] is fighting for [singing] the fear. [music] The light of the world makes the darkness disappear. Out [music and singing] of my life, out of my life. Out of my life. [music] Out of my life. Out of my [singing] life. I don't mind. No fear when [music] I'm walking through the fire cuz I know you're walking right through. No fear when the blood rise by my eyes [singing] on you. No fear. [music] No fear. No fear. [singing] The mighty [music] power of Jesus is mighty for me here. No fear. [music and singing] No fear. No fear. The light [singing] of the world makes the darkness [music] disappear. No fear. Not [singing] over my life. Not over my life. Not [music] over my life. No fear. Not [singing] over my life. Not over my life. Not over my life. Not over my family. [singing] Not over my future. Not over my life. Not over my life. [music and singing] Not over my battle. Not over my [singing] struggle, not [music] over my life. God's over my life. [singing and music] Not over my feelings, not over my future, [music] not over my [singing] life. God's over my [music] life, not over my battle. [singing] Not over my struggles. [music] Not over my life. Not over [music] my life. [singing] Not over my feelings. Not over my future. [music] Not over [singing] my life. Not over my life. Not over my battle. [music] Not over my struggles. Not [singing] over my life. [music] God my life. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Though I walk through [singing] the valley, [music] I will have [singing] no [music] glory. The mighty [music] power of Jesus is [singing] for [music] no. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Light of the world makes the darkness disappear. No be [music] my life. Not over my [singing] life. Not over my life. No [music] my life. [singing] Not over my life. Not over my life. No. Not over [music] my life. [singing] Not over my life. Not over my life. No. [music] Not over my life. Not [singing] over my life. Not over my life. Not over my family. [music] Not my future. [music and singing] [music and singing] Oh [singing] my. [music] My [singing] [music] [singing] [music] Oh my god. [music and singing] [singing] [music and singing] [singing] [music] [music] No, no. The light [music] [singing] of the world makes the dark out [music and singing] of my life. My life. No, my life. My life. Out of my [singing and music] life. No. Out of my life.
