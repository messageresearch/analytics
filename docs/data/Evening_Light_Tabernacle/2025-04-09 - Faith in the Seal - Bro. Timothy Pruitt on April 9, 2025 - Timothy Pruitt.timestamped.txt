[13:34] [Music]
[13:37] you.
[13:39] Amen. How many has a need upon your
[13:41] heart
[13:42] tonight? Amen. We're a needy people, but
[13:45] he said, "I'm your
[13:47] supplier. I'll be your
[13:50] provider." It's nice to have brother
[13:52] Bill Ivy with us. If you wouldn't mind
[13:54] coming and taking the prayer request
[13:55] this evening, Bill, that'd be
[13:59] great. Got many requests that have come
[14:01] in. We do want to remember the Hollis
[14:03] family, Sister
[14:04] Hollis. We've received many requests for
[14:07] Sister Lorie Snow. she had a heart
[14:10] condition and um some complications that
[14:13] have gone on with that. So, we do want
[14:15] to remember Sister Lorie
[14:17] Snow and uh we want to remember Josh and
[14:20] Alex's little baby dealing with
[14:23] congestion and a lot of coughing and not
[14:26] sleeping very well. So, we want to
[14:28] remember her.
[14:30] A customer of ours emailed us the other
[14:32] day and said, "You know, I I see that
[14:36] you're guys believe in God, believe in
[14:40] prayer. Would you remember our family in
[14:44] prayer?" Our husband, her husband has
[14:46] just lost his job and believes that God
[14:49] can provide. Amen. So, we want to pray
[14:52] for them tonight. Her name's Jacqueline
[14:53] Murphy. So, the hem of his garment is
[14:57] not too far away. few minutes. We just
[14:59] want to remember those needs tonight. If
[15:01] you have a
[15:03] need, God bless you.
[15:08] You wonder what I said to brother
[15:11] Tim. I said, "You're getting old,
[15:15] brother. See some gray hairs." I didn't
[15:18] I didn't know they they made them in his
[15:20] head.
[15:22] So, but
[15:24] uh it's been 25 years since we left
[15:30] here. Feel like I'm at home, though, you
[15:33] know. But there is a home we're going to
[15:36] all be at home at one of these days. I I
[15:39] don't believe it's far away. Let's pray.
[15:41] Heavenly Father, you heard the request
[15:44] to the needs of your people. We're a
[15:47] needy people. Every one of us here has
[15:50] has something Lord that that they need
[15:53] from you. And whether they raised their
[15:55] hand or not, whether they turned in a
[15:58] request, they still have a need. And
[16:02] Lord, perhaps through this prayer,
[16:04] you'll minister to them and meet that
[16:06] Lord, as we lay it upon that golden
[16:08] altar above. Perhaps in the preaching of
[16:12] the word there through the entire
[16:14] sermon, there'll be one sentence that'll
[16:17] be said that that'll set somebody free.
[16:20] We just pray, heavenly father, that your
[16:22] will be done. Thank you for your
[16:25] presence here already and we just
[16:27] believe that you'll continue to be with
[16:29] your people through this service. We
[16:32] thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[16:39] Amen. God bless you. Why don't you give
[16:40] the Lord a hand clap of praise
[16:43] [Music]
[16:47] tonight brothers receive the offering
[16:49] tonight? I will enter his gates with
[16:53] thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter
[16:57] his gates with thanksgiving in my heart.
[17:01] I will enter his voice with
[17:05] praise. Heat. Heat.

[25:55] It's only in
[25:57] you. Only in you.

[26:11] It's only in you.
[26:14] Only you.
[26:17] Yes,
[26:18] [Music]
[26:23] Lord. Cover
[26:28] me. Cover me when I am

[26:51] gone. And the peace surpasses all my

[27:08] Hallelujah. How many wants that peace,
[27:10] peace of God to just cover you and cover
[27:14] your heart and life? Let's just go to
[27:16] him in prayer today. Father, we just
[27:19] come to you today, Lord, and just ask
[27:21] once again that you'd come and take
[27:24] control of this service, this place,
[27:28] Lord.
[27:29] Lord, that we can have a moment with
[27:31] you, Father, in your presence, be drawn
[27:34] closer to you, Lord, in this time that
[27:36] we're living in. Father, we ask, Lord,
[27:39] that every hindrance and everything
[27:41] would just be moved out of the way,
[27:43] Lord, that you have preeminence in this
[27:46] service. We
[27:47] pray. We love you with all of our
[27:50] hearts. We thank you, Father, for these
[27:51] opportunities. We we don't take them for
[27:54] granted, Lord. But Lord, looking for
[27:56] that time, Lord, to be together with our
[27:59] believers of light, precious faith from
[28:01] all over the world, and to be in a place
[28:04] never to grow old, never to have to
[28:07] worry about leaving or what's happening
[28:09] tomorrow or what's going on or what
[28:11] happened today. Lord, that place of
[28:13] perfect peace and rest. That's what our
[28:16] hearts are longing for, Lord. That's
[28:18] what we're looking for. We just ask Lord
[28:20] you bless your people tonight in Jesus
[28:23] name.
[28:26] Amen. Turn our Bibles to Ephesians 4.
[28:30] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[28:33] the Lord.
[28:36] It's always good to be amen with
[28:39] believers of like precious faith and to
[28:42] come together with the licks of fire and
[28:44] just have a reprieve for a moment from
[28:46] the things of the we go through in life.
[28:49] Amen. It's just just good to be
[28:52] together. Ephesians 4 and verse 30 says,
[28:54] "Enrieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[28:58] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[29:01] redemption." Amen. We'll let you be
[29:07] seated. Like to speak to you this
[29:09] evening on faith in the seal. Amen. And
[29:13] a seal is is used to guarantee security
[29:18] or to indicate
[29:21] ownership. A seal, if you look up the
[29:23] definition of seal, it means to conclude
[29:26] or establish or secure something
[29:30] definitively, excluding the possibility
[29:33] of reversal or loss.
[29:36] Amen. The seal is a sign that we have of
[29:40] the Holy Ghost. It's a sign that God has
[29:43] chosen you and there's nothing that can
[29:46] reverse it and there's no way he could
[29:48] ever lose you. Amen. He has claimed you
[29:51] as as his own. As the scripture would
[29:53] say, no man can pluck you out of his
[29:56] hand. Amen. Brother Brandon would use
[29:58] this term this this phrase he would in
[30:01] the church age book he would say he
[30:03] would come from the scripture no man can
[30:04] pluck you out of his hand. Then he
[30:07] continues with their lives cannot be
[30:10] tampered with. Amen. Tampered with means
[30:13] to touch or to make changes to something
[30:16] often secretly or
[30:18] dishonestly, especially in a way that
[30:21] can cause damage or harm. Amen. So once
[30:24] a believer's been sealed, amen, their
[30:26] lives can no longer be tampered with.
[30:29] Amen. Satan can't come along secretly
[30:31] and cause them permanent damage or harm,
[30:34] amen, to their spiritual life. but
[30:36] they're forever sealed into the kingdom
[30:38] of almighty God. And he would continue.
[30:40] He said, "The visible life is burning
[30:43] and shining, giving life, giving light
[30:46] and manifestations of the Holy Ghost.
[30:48] The inner vvisible life is hidden in God
[30:51] and fed by the Lord's word. And Satan
[30:54] cannot touch them. Satan cannot touch
[30:57] them. No, even death can't touch them.
[31:00] For death has lost its sting." Amen. The
[31:03] grave has lost its victory. Now, we of
[31:06] course know that Satan still comes
[31:08] against us in the physical realm and it
[31:10] touches our physical body. Amen. But
[31:12] what he's speaking about is he cannot
[31:15] touch you that will in a way that will
[31:17] have a everlasting or eternal effect.
[31:20] Amen. That yeah, he may touch you in
[31:22] your body and make you sick or or you
[31:24] know or touch you and make you feeble or
[31:26] whatever. Amen. But he can never once
[31:28] you're sealed into the kingdom of God,
[31:30] he has lost power. He has lost
[31:32] jurisdiction. He has lost ability to
[31:35] ever affect your eternal destination.
[31:38] But that eternal destination is sealed.
[31:41] Amen. For eternity. Amen. Amen. You
[31:43] know, God gave Abraham the promise as we
[31:46] would we could we know of our father
[31:47] Abraham. And he believed the promise and
[31:50] then and and in believing it was
[31:51] reckoned to him or imputed to him for
[31:54] righteousness. Amen. But when he but he
[31:57] also in that given that promise, he gave
[31:59] him a sign of the promise. And that was
[32:01] the seal. Amen. The circumcision, the
[32:04] the cutting off of the flesh. And and
[32:06] brother Brandon would bring that to us.
[32:07] And he said, you know, you believe God
[32:09] by faith that you've been saved and you
[32:11] accepted him and whatever you do. But
[32:13] God will also give you the Holy Ghost as
[32:16] a seal of the promise that he promised
[32:19] you. The Holy Ghost is a gift of God.
[32:22] That's right. that circumcises the
[32:24] heart. It cuts away the surplus flesh
[32:27] and it makes you a new creature in
[32:29] Christ Jesus. All right, there you are.
[32:31] It's nothing you had to do with it
[32:33] yourself. It's a gift of God. And when
[32:36] you believe correctly, God will give it
[32:38] to you. Amen. So when you have faith,
[32:41] Amen. to believe, Amen, that's the start
[32:43] of things. Yes. To have faith that he is
[32:45] God, to have faith. Amen. But God will
[32:48] also give you a seal. Amen. A
[32:50] confirmation of your faith. Amen. That's
[32:53] why that that's the reason why some
[32:55] Amen. have come along the journey and
[32:56] they have lost their faith because they
[32:59] never received the seal of God. Amen.
[33:01] That would that would seal it to the day
[33:03] of their redemption. They would they
[33:05] come along believing and believing in a
[33:07] prophet and believing in a message or or
[33:09] believing in in supernatural things, but
[33:12] something shook their faith. Amen.
[33:13] Before they could come to that place
[33:15] that that faith could be sealed by the
[33:18] seal of God. Amen. That's what we
[33:20] desire. We want more than just a belief
[33:22] system. We want more than just something
[33:24] that that that uh, you know, promotes a
[33:27] a good life. We want more than that. We
[33:29] want something more than just a good
[33:31] faith. We want more than just believing
[33:33] in there's a God or more than believing
[33:35] there's a prophet. We want to have that
[33:38] seal, that confirmation that our faith
[33:41] has been accepted before God. And
[33:43] therefore, our eternal destination is
[33:45] secure forever.
[33:48] Amen. So, uh, he would he would bring
[33:50] it. He'd say, "The new birth, you know,
[33:52] is an experience. It's a a gift of God.
[33:54] It's a seal of your faith. The Holy
[33:57] Spirit is a seal." Ephesians 4, grieve
[33:59] not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby
[34:01] you're sealed unto the day of your
[34:03] redemption. God made Abraham the
[34:06] promise. But Abraham believed God and
[34:08] was justified by faith. But God gave him
[34:11] the sign of the circumcision as a seal.
[34:14] So, he does that today. So he does that
[34:18] today. We believe him. And then if you
[34:20] say you believe and you do not receive
[34:21] the Holy Spirit, then you do not really
[34:24] believe because God promised to give you
[34:26] the Holy Spirit when you truly believe.
[34:30] Amen. Believe and you not receive the
[34:32] Holy Spirit. Amen. You did not receive
[34:34] the Holy Spirit when you believe. Paul
[34:36] asked in Acts 19, "Have you received the
[34:39] Holy Ghost since you believed?" Amen. It
[34:42] is the gift of God. And when the spirit
[34:43] of God comes into a man, it will quicken
[34:46] him. It'll make him a new creature. He
[34:49] believes in an immortal God and he
[34:51] believes that and all that he does that
[34:53] he does all things and his heart is now
[34:56] in tune with what God's do desires are.
[34:59] Amen. There was a man one time asked
[35:01] him, he said, "What more can a man do
[35:04] but believe?" You know, what more can we
[35:05] do? We believe. He says, "That's all he
[35:08] can do. But God can do more." Yeah.
[35:11] Hallelujah. Amen. He may that may be all
[35:14] he can do, but God can do more. He said,
[35:16] "Well, Abraham believed God, brother
[35:18] Brandham, and and it was imputed to him
[35:20] for righteousness." He said, "That's
[35:21] right." But he gave him the seal of
[35:24] circumcision as a confirmation of his
[35:27] faith. I said, "You haven't received the
[35:29] Holy Ghost. If you haven't received the
[35:31] Holy Ghost since you believe, God has
[35:34] never confirmed he's accepted your
[35:37] faith.
[35:39] He's never confirmed it. For the baptism
[35:41] of the Holy Ghost is a confirmation that
[35:44] God has accepted your faith. Now, what
[35:47] is circumcision today? It's not the
[35:49] cutting off of flesh, off of your body,
[35:52] but it's the cutting off of the fleshly
[35:54] parts of your heart. Amen. desires, the
[35:56] worldly desires, the things of the world
[35:59] where it was done by the flesh, by the
[36:01] hands of go against the flesh, days gone
[36:03] by. But now the Holy Spirit comes in and
[36:06] it cuts off all those things and then we
[36:09] can correctly believe on the Lord Jesus
[36:11] Christ and God gives the Holy Ghost to
[36:13] us to confirm it that our faith has been
[36:16] reckoned before him and now it is
[36:18] imputed to us for righteousness. Without
[36:21] the Holy Spirit, it has never been
[36:23] recognized yet. That's right. Come on.
[36:27] Without the Holy Spirit. Now, you know,
[36:29] this brother was, you know, no doubt, he
[36:31] said, a good Baptist brother of mine
[36:33] said, "You received the Holy Ghost when
[36:35] you believed." I said, "Brother, in Acts
[36:37] the 19th chapter, Paul passed a bunch of
[36:40] good Baptist brethren and said, "Have
[36:41] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[36:43] believe? Since you believe? Have you
[36:45] received the Holy Ghost?" The Holy Ghost
[36:47] is a confirmation that God has accepted
[36:51] your faith. You know, Cain was a
[36:53] believer.
[36:55] Amen. If believer was all you needed to
[36:57] be, Cain would have had it made. But it
[36:59] was more than being just a believer.
[37:01] Amen. Judas was a believer. He believed.
[37:05] He He worked miracles. He He done signs
[37:07] and wonders. He done all those things.
[37:09] But brother Vam said he showed his true
[37:11] colors when it came to receiving the
[37:13] circumcision of faith, the Holy Ghost.
[37:18] Amen. He was possessed. Brother actually
[37:21] said, you know, talks about said he was
[37:22] possessed with the Antichrist spirit,
[37:24] walked plum almost to Pentecost with
[37:26] him, rejoicing, casting out devils,
[37:29] shouting and has great joy. But when it
[37:31] came time for him to get the Holy Ghost,
[37:34] he showed his colors what he truly was.
[37:37] That's why we got to have more than just
[37:39] joy.
[37:42] We want more than just emotion. Right.
[37:45] We want more than just a shout or a
[37:47] dance or or or or speaking in tongues.
[37:50] We want more than just that. We want the
[37:52] confirmation that our faith has been
[37:55] accepted. That's right. And then once
[37:57] your faith has been accepted by the seal
[37:59] of the Holy Ghost, you can still hold
[38:02] and you can still be held when you don't
[38:04] have joy. When you're not dancing and
[38:07] shouting, when you don't have a whole
[38:08] lot of emotion going on, and you may
[38:10] feel sad and downhearted, but something
[38:13] on the inside has confirmed, I'm a son
[38:16] of God, and the gates of hell will not
[38:18] prevail against it.
[38:20] That's good. The Holy Ghost is a seal.
[38:24] It is a sign that God gave his chosen
[38:27] children. To reject it is to be cut from
[38:30] the people from from the people of God.
[38:32] To receive it is to be finished with the
[38:35] world and all the things of the world.
[38:38] To be a product that God has put a seal
[38:41] of approval on. Amen.
[38:44] My what what an honor that is to be
[38:48] something worthy of him putting his seal
[38:50] on. Amen. He said, "You know, I used to
[38:53] work on the
[38:54] railroad here and he said we'd go down
[38:56] and load a car and my brother Doc
[38:58] standing back there would help load
[39:00] cars. When the car was being loaded,
[39:02] they'd go through the car. The inspector
[39:04] would and if he finds anything loose
[39:07] where it would fall or break or anything
[39:08] would be destroyed, he would not seal
[39:11] that car until that car was so
[39:13] completely packed and it was so packed
[39:15] down and so in order that the shaking of
[39:18] the ride won't bother the product that's
[39:20] on the inside.
[39:22] Oh my, that's what's the matter. We
[39:24] don't get sealed so much that we're too
[39:27] loose about things. And he said, "When
[39:28] the inspector comes through to inspect
[39:30] your life, you see you're not just a
[39:32] little loose about things, a little
[39:33] loose maybe about prayer life or or
[39:36] maybe a little loose about your temper,
[39:37] a little loose at the tongue to talk
[39:39] about others. He won't seal that car.
[39:41] Some dirty habits, some vile things,
[39:43] some ver vulgarity in your mind. He He
[39:46] can't seal that car. But when he found
[39:48] everything in its place, he then seals
[39:50] it. Dare be anyone open that seal until
[39:53] the car has reached his destination to
[39:56] where it's sealed for." Amen. There it
[39:58] is. Touch not mine anointed. Do my
[40:00] prophets no harm. For I say unto you,
[40:02] it's better for you that a millstone be
[40:03] hanged around your neck and you were
[40:05] drowned in the depths of the sea than to
[40:07] often or to even try to offend or shake
[40:10] a little one. The least of these has
[40:11] been sealed. See what it means? That's
[40:13] what the Holy Spirit is. It's your
[40:15] assurance.
[40:18] Come on. It's your assurance. It's your
[40:20] protection. It's your witness. It's your
[40:23] seal. It's your sign. I am heaven bound.
[40:28] Yes, the road might get a little rock in
[40:30] and the train car might sway a little
[40:32] bit. Amen. And get winds of hell may
[40:35] blow against me. But I am headed for a
[40:37] certain destination. And there's nothing
[40:40] going to stop me. Sure, I might have
[40:42] mind battles. Sure, I might have
[40:44] troubles along the way. But I am going
[40:47] to go through.
[40:49] Why am I going to go through? Because I
[40:50] have faith in the one who put the seal
[40:53] upon my heart that he can hold me no
[40:55] matter what I'm going through.
[40:58] Wonderful.
[41:02] He says, "I'm heaven bound. I don't care
[41:05] what the devil says. I'm heaven bound."
[41:11] When you realize this seal has been
[41:13] placed upon your heart, there's no more
[41:15] talking you out of it. You don't go from
[41:17] one camp to another camp worrying about
[41:19] it. no more. You know, it's not a
[41:22] sealed. You're sealed into the next
[41:23] youth camp or you're sealed into the
[41:25] next service or you're sealed into the
[41:27] next time you feel right or you feel
[41:29] good or you feel happy. That's not what
[41:31] this seal is. This seal is a is a
[41:34] finished. It's a it's done. It's over
[41:36] with. Amen. The question of that of your
[41:39] eternal destination is over. Sure, the
[41:41] devil may question it and the sure the
[41:44] devil may come and try to make you
[41:45] question, but deep down the inside of
[41:48] you, there'll be something that responds
[41:50] to that and say, "No, I know I met him
[41:52] for myself. I know he changed me. I know
[41:55] he made me different. I know I'm a new
[41:57] creature in Christ Jesus. Sure, I might
[42:00] have made a few mistakes. I might have
[42:01] faltered along the way, but I got back
[42:03] up again and I've continued on with my
[42:06] Lord, and I'm walking with Jesus."
[42:12] That's what the Holy Spirit is. He
[42:15] sealed me. He gave it to me.
[42:20] So, let me tell you, the devil can't
[42:21] take anything away that he didn't give
[42:23] you.
[42:25] If God gave it to you, ain't nothing the
[42:27] devil can do about it. He sealed me into
[42:29] his kingdom. I'm glory bound. Let the
[42:32] winds blow. Let Satan do what he wants
[42:34] to do. God's done sealed me to the day
[42:37] of my redemption. That's what the Holy
[42:40] Ghost is. And oh, you should want it. I
[42:43] can't go on without it. Amen.
[42:46] Hallelujah. Amen. I trust all of us have
[42:49] that desire today. And listen, this seal
[42:52] holds. Now, there's men that have tried
[42:54] to seal, put seals, and their seals
[42:56] failed. Amen. Roman kingdoms tried to
[42:58] seal things and they failed. We can look
[43:00] right there at the very resurrection of
[43:01] Jesus Christ. They put a seal over the
[43:03] tomb. And they was daring anybody to
[43:06] break that seal. But Amen. God showed he
[43:09] was greater than any Roman seal or Amen.
[43:12] And that in any demon seal or anything
[43:14] the devil tried to seal, you know, the
[43:16] devil tries to put seals on you, too. He
[43:18] tries to seal you into a life of of sin
[43:21] or seal you into a life of drugs and
[43:23] alcohol or seal you into a life a life
[43:26] of whatever. Amen. Every kind of vice
[43:28] that he has. Amen. But there is a power
[43:31] greater than what the devil has. Amen.
[43:33] But I'm telling you, the seal that I'm
[43:35] talking about, there's no power greater.
[43:38] There ain't a power big enough, great
[43:39] enough, strong enough that could ever
[43:41] break the seal that has been put upon a
[43:44] believer's heart. He'll go through hell.
[43:46] He'll go through sickness. He'll go
[43:48] through trouble. He'll go through
[43:50] trials. He'll go through mind battles.
[43:52] He'll go through depression. He'll go
[43:54] through anxiety. But he'll come back out
[43:57] the other side sealed to the day of the
[44:00] redemption. Amen.
[44:06] Cuz we know we have faith in this seal,
[44:09] this seal's been tested. That's right.
[44:13] He said, "Inoculations, brother Brandon
[44:14] would also call it."
[44:16] He said, "We find," he said, "we find
[44:18] out that when man tries to find a serum,
[44:21] a doctor, you know, to give to a certain
[44:24] thing to a patient to inoculate him from
[44:26] a sickness, might try it on a guinea pig
[44:28] first and see if it'll work. Works on
[44:30] them. might try to find some volunteer
[44:32] human to do it. But God didn't work that
[44:35] way.
[44:37] God never took a guinea pig. He didn't
[44:40] even use another human.
[44:44] He didn't just come to I'm going to
[44:45] choose you. You do it. No, he came
[44:47] himself.
[44:49] He used it on himself. And he said, "A
[44:53] good doctor that wants to try sy serum,
[44:55] if he don't know whether to kill or
[44:57] cure, he ought to take it himself
[44:59] first." That's right. Right?
[45:02] Sounds sounds logical to me. But they
[45:04] want to poke stuff down you they ain't
[45:06] even took themselves and heck like it's
[45:07] a miracle
[45:08] thing. Cause all kind of issues.
[45:12] Amen. But he said if he wants to really
[45:14] know if it'll kill or cure, he ought to
[45:16] make sure he takes it himself to find
[45:17] out before he puts it in somebody else.
[45:19] But in God and God in order to take this
[45:22] serum, he had to be made flesh and come
[45:24] down as one of us as a kinsman redeemer.
[45:27] And God had to become a man. Amen. Just
[45:30] like you and I so he could take this
[45:32] serum. And he had his he had his
[45:34] inoculation at Jordan. Amen. When he
[45:37] walked out of the river by John and was
[45:39] baptized and then the inoculation came
[45:41] down and the toxin fell from heaven like
[45:44] a dove and said, "This is my beloved son
[45:47] in whom I'm pleased to dwell in." There
[45:49] he was inoculated. Amen.
[45:54] And immediately after the
[45:57] inoculation testing comes, you know, we
[46:00] got the wrong idea sometimes. We we get
[46:02] we we get experience with God and we
[46:06] think, well, we're just going to roll on
[46:08] just a little bit and take it easy now.
[46:09] No. All that that just turns all the
[46:11] guns of hell towards you.
[46:15] Amen. It turns all the guns of hell
[46:17] towards you. And this is what he he said
[46:19] immediately. Scripture talks about Amen.
[46:21] the spirit took him into the wilderness.
[46:23] He was taken into the wilderness to be
[46:24] tested. See, God was going to put this
[46:27] through a test to make sure that when he
[46:29] put it inside of somebody else, he knew
[46:32] what kind of effect it would have upon
[46:34] them.
[46:36] That's a good doctor right there. He
[46:39] didn't want to put it in them say,
[46:40] "Well, that didn't work. Let me try
[46:41] something." No. He wanted to find out if
[46:44] it would work and if it would hold. and
[46:46] and he's taken up for the first time and
[46:48] he says every man as soon as you receive
[46:50] the Holy Ghost and become inoculated,
[46:53] every demon out of hell will turn
[46:55] against you.
[46:57] Even family sometime will turn you down.
[47:00] Husbands and wives and pastors, maybe
[47:02] you get kicked out of a church or
[47:04] laughed at or made fun of. It's the
[47:06] test. Amen.
[47:08] Every son will be tested and tried to
[47:12] see if you really got what you say you
[47:14] got.
[47:21] God became flesh, one of us, that he
[47:23] might take the inoculation or become
[47:26] subject to sin. For he was born of a
[47:28] woman. He was tempted in all manners as
[47:30] we are. He couldn't do it as long as he
[47:32] was in spirit form or he had to come
[47:35] down and be made fleshed in order to be
[47:37] tempted to take the inoculation to take
[47:39] the toxin. He wanted to prove that his
[47:42] toxin was right. So he took it on the
[47:44] day that John baptized him with the
[47:46] toxin came down and all of heaven opened
[47:49] up and it filled him. Then the test come
[47:52] but it
[47:53] held. It held in every mocking trial. It
[47:57] held whenever Satan offered him
[47:59] everything. It offered him the world. It
[48:01] offered him the kingdoms. Amen. It held.
[48:05] And let me tell you, it'll hold today.
[48:08] Satan will offer you all kinds of
[48:09] things. But if you have that inoculation
[48:12] on the inside of you, it'll hold. That's
[48:14] right.
[48:16] Amen. The world looked on him, the
[48:18] church looked down on the critics looked
[48:20] at him, and mockers made fun of him, and
[48:22] devils laughed at him, but it held.
[48:26] Yes, sir. He stood there before a bunch
[48:28] of educated priests and and he said they
[48:31] said you know which one of you can
[48:32] condemn me of sin. That inoculation
[48:36] held. He said if I do not the works of
[48:38] my father then believe me not. But if I
[48:40] do the works then believe me. They said
[48:42] you're a man making yourself God. He
[48:44] said if I don't do the works of my
[48:45] father then don't believe it. But my
[48:47] works are speaking louder than my mouth
[48:49] ever can. That's right.
[48:53] It held.
[48:57] He says, "You are what you are by the
[49:00] way you live."
[49:03] Watch where the prophet drops in right
[49:04] there. He says, "You are what you are by
[49:07] the way you live. You're not what you
[49:09] are by the way you talk
[49:14] or the way you
[49:15] dress or the way you are, but the way
[49:18] you live. That's what makes you who you
[49:20] are. The outside expresses what's going
[49:23] on on the inside.
[49:26] This hallow shallow. He talks about card
[49:28] playing, cigarette smoking generation
[49:30] that calls themselves Christians. Bob
[49:32] hair women dancers, television friends,
[49:34] nasty jokes, calling yourself
[49:36] Christians. You need inoculations. Back
[49:38] to Pentecost again. That's right. You're
[49:40] in great need. It held on Jesus when he
[49:42] was tested of everything a man could be
[49:44] tested by. Every temptation that ever
[49:47] fell upon a man fell on him. But that
[49:50] inoculation held. That seal held. If you
[49:54] want to know whether it'll hold or not,
[49:56] whether this thing is right or not, look
[49:58] at him. Yes, sir. That's right. If you
[50:00] want to know if it'll hold today, look
[50:02] at him. That's right. If you not want to
[50:04] know if it'll hold when you're sick,
[50:06] look at him. If you want to know if
[50:08] it'll hold when friends walk away, look
[50:10] at him.
[50:13] Amen.
[50:17] It held. They put a rag around his
[50:21] face. A man who had the power to speak
[50:25] and legions of angels would come.
[50:29] And he held
[50:33] boy. What we have? What would do happen
[50:36] on 20 if we had the power to
[50:40] speak? Mercy Jesus.
[50:44] And here he could have called 10,000
[50:47] legions. Just one nod.
[50:51] But it held.
[50:53] Why was he allowing all this to show to
[50:55] be to to be be put there? So you 2,000
[50:59] years later could look at it and say the
[51:01] same God that was there is now in us. So
[51:06] if it held in those situations, he's the
[51:08] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[51:10] It'll hold in this situation. That's
[51:13] right. It'll hold when the church turns
[51:15] against me. It'll hold when this goes
[51:17] on. It'll hold when my family is falling
[51:19] apart. It'll hold. Amen. Why? Because it
[51:22] held there. It'll hold now.
[51:30] Listen, if people are blowing up,
[51:33] blowing apart, and their lives are being
[51:35] torn, it shows you they never had the
[51:37] holding power.
[51:39] is not saying that the holding power
[51:41] wasn't strong enough
[51:44] cuz he tested it in every way that could
[51:46] be tested. So he knows that it'll hold
[51:49] look G look at Jesus that could heal the
[51:51] sick. He can raise the dead. He can do
[51:52] all these things. Foretell tell people
[51:54] know their hearts sitting in pilot's c
[51:57] courtyard with a rag wrapped around his
[51:59] eyes and a Roman soldiers drunk spitting
[52:02] his face beard pulled out hit him in the
[52:04] head with a reed and says take the rag
[52:06] off now and tell us who you are if
[52:07] you're a prophet. Tell us who hit you.
[52:09] He never opened his mouth. Sure. He
[52:12] didn't have to gimmick. That was God.
[52:13] Pull your hands off the cross. Come down
[52:15] and we'll believe sincerely. We're the
[52:17] priest. We're God's servant. You'll
[52:18] prove it. We'll come down. You'll come
[52:20] down off the cross. We'll know that
[52:22] you're the son of God. You are our king.
[52:24] Come down off the cross.
[52:27] But he could not come down.
[52:30] Why? Because he was proven it's going to
[52:32] hold you.
[52:34] That when you're in the hardest trial of
[52:36] your life,
[52:38] you feel like all friends have walked
[52:40] away. And you walked away. There's
[52:41] nobody who's been maybe beside you with
[52:43] two thieves and all the disciples have
[52:46] left and this one's gone and you wonder
[52:48] and you can still stand there and it'll
[52:50] hold.
[52:53] Amen. Amen. Things can be falling apart
[52:56] around you and you can't you can't grab
[52:58] a hold of it and put it back together.
[53:00] If you try, it'll hold.
[53:05] Our prophet come down to that same spot
[53:07] in his life. Amen. when he was there
[53:09] looking at his little baby dying and his
[53:11] wife dying and and he and the devil
[53:14] sitting on his shoulder saying why don't
[53:15] you just curse God he all the things
[53:17] you've done the prayers that you prayed
[53:19] you prayed for so many and look at this
[53:20] one die he's tell you just put a black
[53:22] sheet he don't care nothing about you
[53:28] he don't care what you're going through
[53:30] look at you you're suffering and you
[53:32] prayed and he's answered all kind of
[53:33] prayers for other people but now you're
[53:35] praying for yourself and he turns his
[53:37] back.
[53:40] And he said, "I was just about to say
[53:43] something." Well, that's the way it is.
[53:46] And he said, "All of a sudden, something
[53:47] went out on the inside."
[53:50] It held.
[53:53] How many has ever come to that place?
[53:55] You thought, "I I can't hold on no
[53:57] longer." Well, good. You're not hold the
[53:58] one doing the holding anyhow. It's God
[54:01] that's holding you. Amen. I wasn't the
[54:04] one that chose him in the first place.
[54:05] He chose me and he put his life inside
[54:08] of me and he found me worthy to put his
[54:11] seal upon. Amen. So when I go through my
[54:13] trial, I'm not going to worry about am I
[54:15] holding on? Can I hold through this? Can
[54:17] I hold? It ain't me holding on. It's him
[54:19] holding on to me. And there ain't a
[54:22] devil in hell that can break his hold
[54:24] off of your life.
[54:37] The inoculation held on Jesus. It held
[54:40] at the
[54:42] cross. It held when he could have come
[54:44] down off that cross. Billy Sunday said,
[54:47] "Every tree was sitting full of angels."
[54:49] Said, "You don't have to come off the
[54:50] cross. Just point your finger. We'll
[54:52] change the whole situation."
[54:54] But he said, "I do that always. It
[54:57] pleases the father." Amen. The
[54:59] inoculation held. The word, the will of
[55:02] God stayed in him. No matter whether he
[55:04] was patted on the back and called the
[55:06] young rabbi of Galilee or whether he was
[55:08] called Beelzebub,
[55:11] it held. Whether he was called the devil
[55:14] or fortune teller or blasphemy was said
[55:17] about him, the inoculation held. Then
[55:20] they watched if he'd scream and take it
[55:22] back all all back at the cross, but he
[55:25] couldn't take it back. It held.
[55:27] Everything forsook him. His church, his
[55:29] people, even God forsook him.
[55:31] Everything. But the inoculation held.
[55:36] That's the way. Back that way. It held.
[55:39] No matter what come or what went, it
[55:41] held. The inoculation held. They watched
[55:43] him die. Not like a coward,
[55:46] but like a prince. He never flinched. He
[55:49] looked at He looked at death like a
[55:51] prince. He knew, Amen. death was about
[55:54] to lose its victory.
[55:58] Amen. Because he knew what the word had
[56:00] prophesied about him. Amen. You lay
[56:03] there and you take this temple and you
[56:04] destroy it. In three days, I'll raise it
[56:06] up again. I'll not suffer my holy one to
[56:09] see corruption. He knew what the word
[56:11] spoke about him. That's right. And he
[56:14] had faith in what he said. And he had
[56:16] faith to go down into hell. And he had
[56:18] faith that he was going to rise again.
[56:22] Amen. Oh yeah.
[56:28] The word of God spoke that he would do
[56:29] it. And he did
[56:31] it. Didn't the same. And then he follows
[56:34] all that up. He said, "Didn't the same
[56:37] Holy Ghost say these signs follow them
[56:39] that believe?"
[56:42] How in the world are we going to get
[56:43] away from it? You have it if you are
[56:46] inoculated. Amen. If you have the side
[56:49] seal. He said to the woman, "Could you
[56:51] drink the cup that I drink? Could you be
[56:53] inoculated with the inoculation that I'm
[56:55] inoculated with? I can't give it to you.
[56:58] You the right hand, the left hand of
[56:59] your sons, but if you'll drink this cup
[57:00] and do it, it'll be all right.
[57:02] Certainly, it's not mine to give that.
[57:04] But if you drink the cup that I drink,
[57:06] be inoculated with the same spirit that
[57:08] I'm baptized with, then everything will
[57:11] be all right."
[57:13] Come on, somebody. Amen. And if you'll
[57:16] receive the Holy Ghost and you'll
[57:18] receive the seal of God into your life
[57:20] to the day of your redemption,
[57:21] everything will be all right. It don't
[57:24] matter what comes between now and then.
[57:26] Everything will be all right. I got
[57:29] sickness. I got problems. I got say
[57:31] everything will be all right cuz it
[57:34] don't none of this down here of this
[57:36] this uh time time being stuff or you
[57:40] know this earthly time matters to
[57:42] eternity. It has no reflection on
[57:45] eternity. Amen. Your sickness is a time
[57:48] being.
[57:50] It's affected by time. It only has a
[57:53] certain amount of time that it can deal
[57:55] with that it can dwell in your body.
[57:57] That's right. Come on. It might take you
[57:59] down to death, but it'll come to its
[58:02] last time. But if it does end up taking
[58:05] a believer to his death, that might not
[58:07] be the sickness's last time, but it's
[58:09] not the believer's last time cuz it did
[58:12] not affect their eternal destination.
[58:14] But they have been sealed until their
[58:17] final moments
[58:21] and it held.
[58:24] I've watched men in this age die, men of
[58:27] faith, and it held.
[58:31] Amen.
[58:37] men that had been sealed with the Holy
[58:39] Ghost, it
[58:41] held. He said when the disciples seen
[58:45] that, when he came, he said he came
[58:47] back. He said, "Go tell my disciples."
[58:49] He came to I'm back exactly as I said I
[58:51] would. The inoculation held. I died just
[58:55] like the Bible said I'd die, but the
[58:57] inoculation held. My soul descended into
[59:00] hell like the Bible said it would, but
[59:02] the inoculation held. I have the keys of
[59:05] death and hell in the grave. I'm a I'm
[59:07] rose again and I'm alive forever more.
[59:09] Evidence, proof that the inoculation
[59:12] will hold. The disciples seen that. They
[59:14] said, "Well, we want that inoculation,
[59:16] too. We want He said, "Well, I tell you
[59:17] what you do. You go into the city of
[59:19] Jerusalem and wait there until I send
[59:21] the toxin. If you want eternal life, you
[59:24] want to do this thing that I have, this
[59:25] thing that I have before the
[59:27] resurrection, you want the thing that'll
[59:28] keep you in the way, it'll that has kept
[59:31] me. If you want the thing that'll let
[59:32] you die like I die, you want something
[59:34] that'll raise you up from the grave, I'm
[59:36] going to send it back to you, go there
[59:38] and wait on it. He never said, "Go get
[59:40] your degree of LLD or go learn your
[59:42] ABCs, but wait until you're inoculated
[59:45] or end with power from on high." Wait,
[59:47] stay there. Wait, not go four years in
[59:50] the seminary. not be pumped with a bunch
[59:52] of inbombing fluid pumped into you.
[59:53] You're not a guinea pig. You're a son.
[59:57] Amen. Wait until endu with power until
[59:59] the inoculation of the eternal life
[1:00:02] comes upon you and it'll raise you up at
[1:00:05] the last day just like it did me. And he
[1:00:08] had some candidates right away. And I
[1:00:10] first heard he said when I first heard
[1:00:13] it, I was one too. I didn't care what
[1:00:15] they said to me and I wanted that. I've
[1:00:17] always said if that this ain't that, I
[1:00:19] want that. I'll keep this till that
[1:00:21] comes. That's what I want. I want that
[1:00:24] inoculation. I got to have that
[1:00:26] inoculation. They went up there and the
[1:00:28] Holy Spirit began to fall upon them and
[1:00:31] they were filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:32] They began to speak with other tongues,
[1:00:34] tongues of fire sitting on them. God,
[1:00:36] the great pillar of fire, the same one
[1:00:38] that followed the that led the children
[1:00:40] of Israel. Not three gods, one God has
[1:00:43] now come in spirit form and now living
[1:00:46] in his people. Amen. Hallelujah. God
[1:00:50] divided himself among his church. Like a
[1:00:53] man and his wife being one. So God and
[1:00:55] his church is one. There's one. That day
[1:00:58] you'll know the I am the father. The
[1:00:59] father and me and I and you and you and
[1:01:01] me. That's the inoculation he received
[1:01:04] is not me that doeth the works. It's my
[1:01:06] father. Amen. That inoculation. It
[1:01:09] inoculated them from unbelief. It
[1:01:12] inoculated them from fears and anxieties
[1:01:15] and worries of death. And what would
[1:01:17] happen? They laid their life down
[1:01:19] willingly because of that inoculation.
[1:01:23] He said that same inoculation will also
[1:01:26] inoculate you from unbelief.
[1:01:29] Amen. Come on, somebody. It'll also
[1:01:32] inoculate you from unbelief. It'll
[1:01:34] anchor you with a settled faith in
[1:01:36] Christ. That's why we want a settled
[1:01:39] faith in Christ. Not something that you
[1:01:42] question and it time after time and you
[1:01:44] question it. But let that question be
[1:01:47] settled once and for all. I am his son.
[1:01:50] I am his daughter. And there ain't a
[1:01:52] devil in hell that can do anything about
[1:01:55] it cuz he put his life inside of me.
[1:02:00] Amen.
[1:02:02] No man could ever talk you out of it
[1:02:06] from that moment on. That's right.
[1:02:10] Hello. No website could ever talk you
[1:02:14] out of it.
[1:02:19] If they could talk you out of it, it's
[1:02:21] cuz you've been talked into it.
[1:02:24] We're not interested in talking people
[1:02:25] into this.
[1:02:28] Cuz if we talk them into it, they'll be
[1:02:30] talked out of it. Amen. What we're
[1:02:32] interested is people be born into this.
[1:02:35] Come on, somebody. Cuz once you're born
[1:02:38] into it, Amen. You You don't have no
[1:02:40] shame no more about it. It's over with.
[1:02:44] Come on. Amen. God has dealt wondrously
[1:02:46] with your heart and took all your
[1:02:48] unbelief away and took all your fear and
[1:02:51] all your doubts away. And it doesn't
[1:02:52] matter what any man can say anymore.
[1:02:54] They can say whatever they want to say.
[1:02:56] They can bring all kind of accusations
[1:02:58] they want to bring against the
[1:03:00] supernatural and the things of God.
[1:03:02] Place it on all kind of websites. It
[1:03:04] don't matter no more cuz I wasn't talked
[1:03:07] into this. Therefore, I will not be
[1:03:09] talked out of it. I was born into the
[1:03:11] kingdom of God.
[1:03:18] Your whole life has changed. You're a
[1:03:21] new creature.
[1:03:24] And there ain't enough devils in hell
[1:03:27] that can take it away from you. Amen.
[1:03:31] Amen.
[1:03:33] Did I read that right? That's a direct
[1:03:35] quote. There ain't enough devils in hell
[1:03:38] that can take it away from you.
[1:03:44] Hallelujah. What must I do to receive
[1:03:46] this inoculation? Well, we've been given
[1:03:48] the prescription.
[1:03:51] Acts two. Amen. Read Acts two. Repent.
[1:03:55] Yes. Not sorry I got caught. Repent.
[1:03:59] Say, "God, I'm sick of my old ways. I'm
[1:04:01] sick of the way I am. I'm sick of my
[1:04:03] bloodline that I was born in. I'm sick
[1:04:05] of my life and the way I've lived. I'm
[1:04:07] sick of it all." Repent.
[1:04:10] And they be baptized. What's B? What do
[1:04:12] you mean baptized? Be immersed. Be be
[1:04:15] laid down as a dead man in a grave, in a
[1:04:18] watery grave. And when you've repented
[1:04:20] and you've laid yourself down before him
[1:04:23] and you rise, not to take on the name of
[1:04:25] Puit or Brandom or this or that and the
[1:04:28] other, but you take on the name, not
[1:04:30] titles. You don't take on the titles of
[1:04:32] father, son, and holy ghost. You take on
[1:04:34] the name. Amen. The name of the father,
[1:04:37] the name of the son, and the name of the
[1:04:39] holy ghost. One God, the lord Jesus
[1:04:42] Christ. And you rise up. No longer
[1:04:45] Timothy Puit, but a son of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:50] Amen. And there ain't enough devils.
[1:04:55] You won't have to worry about going to
[1:04:56] the next camp. Lost it.
[1:05:02] Listen, we ain't interested in camp
[1:05:04] religion.
[1:05:07] If that's all we're getting, I don't
[1:05:09] even want it. That that ain't what it's
[1:05:10] about. I'm not interested in Sunday
[1:05:12] religion or Wednesday religion.
[1:05:16] I'm not interested in religion in
[1:05:18] itself.
[1:05:20] I want the life of Jesus Christ. I want
[1:05:23] it demonstrated in our midst. I want the
[1:05:25] life in young people. I want them to be
[1:05:27] able to rise up at school and say, "I am
[1:05:30] a son of God." I want them to rise up at
[1:05:32] their jobs and say, "I am a daughter of
[1:05:34] God."
[1:05:35] And when the devil comes and he tries to
[1:05:38] whisper those things in their ears, they
[1:05:40] can shut him off by the word of God and
[1:05:42] say, "Devil, you have lost your power
[1:05:44] over me cuz I am now a daughter of God.
[1:05:48] I am now a son of God born into the
[1:05:50] kingdom of God.
[1:05:57] Ain't enough devils."
[1:06:00] What is the Holy Ghost? It's an
[1:06:04] advocate. What is an
[1:06:07] advocate? What what what does an
[1:06:09] advocate do? What makes an advocate?
[1:06:11] It's mercy. It stands in your place. It
[1:06:15] does the things you can't do. Amen.
[1:06:20] I can't live an overcoming life. It can.
[1:06:24] I can't rise above pornography. It can.
[1:06:26] Yes, sir.
[1:06:28] It does the things you can't do. It's a
[1:06:31] propituation for your sins. It's your
[1:06:33] righteousness. It's your healing. It's
[1:06:35] your life. It's your resurrection. It's
[1:06:37] all that God has for you. He is an
[1:06:40] advocate. How we could go into the
[1:06:42] details of that and break it down of how
[1:06:44] that when he makes intercession for our
[1:06:45] ignorance, sometimes when we get the
[1:06:47] Holy Ghost, we st ignorantly stagger
[1:06:49] into something. But the Holy Spirit is
[1:06:52] there as an
[1:06:54] advocate. He is our advocate. He stands
[1:06:57] there. He is our attorney. He stands
[1:06:59] there and pleads our case. We don't
[1:07:01] plead for ourselves because the Holy
[1:07:03] Ghost is in us to plead for us. The Holy
[1:07:06] Ghost given utterance sometimes with
[1:07:07] words we can't understand and makes
[1:07:09] intercessions for us. That's what the
[1:07:11] Holy Ghost is.
[1:07:17] He said, "When I walk anything," he
[1:07:19] said, "I walk like a little kid." You
[1:07:21] walk like a little fella. We're walking
[1:07:23] in a dark world full of enemies, full of
[1:07:25] sin, full of traps, full of everything.
[1:07:27] You say, "Well, I'm afraid. I'm afraid
[1:07:28] to take Christian life. I'm afraid to do
[1:07:30] this. I'm afraid to don't be afraid." We
[1:07:33] have an advocate. He stands beside us.
[1:07:37] He's in us. He's making intercession for
[1:07:39] us. The Holy Spirit constantly making an
[1:07:42] advocate for us all the time. He is our
[1:07:44] advocate. Oh, how we thank God for that.
[1:07:45] A seal, a sign, the spirit of life, the
[1:07:48] God of heaven, the comforter, the life,
[1:07:50] the advocate. What is he? Oh my. We
[1:07:52] could go on for hours. Amen. So, what
[1:07:54] we're going to ask now promises. He's
[1:07:56] promised to us in the last days his
[1:07:58] advocate seal promise everything that we
[1:08:00] have talked about him tonight with
[1:08:01] 10,000 times more. It was made a promise
[1:08:04] to us in the last days. They didn't have
[1:08:07] to have it in that day. They had that
[1:08:08] seal on their flesh as a token, a sign,
[1:08:11] believing it was coming. They walked in
[1:08:13] the shadow of the law with the
[1:08:14] circumcision of flesh. Today, we don't
[1:08:16] walk in the shadows.
[1:08:19] We walk by the power of the
[1:08:20] resurrection. We walk by the power of
[1:08:23] the spirit who is our true seal, our
[1:08:26] true advocate, our true comforter, our
[1:08:28] true sign that we've been born from
[1:08:30] above. Peculiar, odd people acting
[1:08:33] funny, taking God at his word, calling
[1:08:35] everything else wrong. God's word is
[1:08:37] right and that's all. That's right.
[1:08:41] That's what the Holy Ghost is.
[1:08:45] 50. In another place, he said, "The seal
[1:08:49] is a finished work.
[1:08:52] When you write your complete letter,
[1:08:54] everything that's going to be and you
[1:08:56] seal it with your name. They used to
[1:08:58] back in the day, you write a letter and
[1:09:00] take the envelope and then they would
[1:09:02] bring the little corner piece down and
[1:09:04] they would drop a bit of wax on there,
[1:09:05] heat some wax up and drop it. Then they
[1:09:08] would put a seal in that wax and it was
[1:09:10] to show that this letter when it
[1:09:11] arrived, if the seal was still in place,
[1:09:14] it hadn't been disturbed. Nobody had got
[1:09:15] in there and tampered with it or if
[1:09:17] there's money in it or whatever, they
[1:09:19] didn't get it because that seal showed
[1:09:20] it made it safely to his destination.
[1:09:24] Amen. He says it's it's a it's showing
[1:09:26] you that the package is still sealed up
[1:09:28] goes again to the box car and the
[1:09:30] inspector coming by and if he finds
[1:09:32] stuff shook loose, he wanted to see if
[1:09:34] anything was loose. If anything was
[1:09:36] loose, he didn't condemn it. That's
[1:09:37] what's the matter. The inspector going
[1:09:39] by, he goes into a lot of our lives. the
[1:09:41] reason we don't get it. We might carry
[1:09:43] on and act like it, you know, that's but
[1:09:46] the fruits show you you don't have it.
[1:09:48] And he shakes and he finds little loose
[1:09:50] places here of unbelief, little loose
[1:09:52] places over there and he condemns it and
[1:09:54] sets it back down. It's got to be packed
[1:09:57] right because you got a rough road to
[1:09:59] travel.
[1:10:01] But when God gives a man or woman the
[1:10:03] Holy Ghost, he shakes every loose
[1:10:06] feather out of them.
[1:10:08] He's got a ride coming. see if she's
[1:10:11] packed up right. What did he do?
[1:10:12] Justification, he called her.
[1:10:14] Sanctification, he cleansed her. The
[1:10:15] Holy Ghost, he sealed her, packed it
[1:10:17] tight, and then closed the door. That's
[1:10:19] what the last thing is. Put the seal on
[1:10:21] the road car to his destination. Not the
[1:10:24] next revival, but to his destination
[1:10:27] whereby grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:10:28] God whereby you're sealed until the next
[1:10:31] revival comes along, until the next
[1:10:33] youth camp comes along. No, until you
[1:10:35] take a notion to go somewhere else or do
[1:10:37] something else. until the day of your
[1:10:39] redemption.
[1:10:42] Amen. When God gives you the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:45] it's a finished work.
[1:10:50] When a baby comes forth, what's the
[1:10:52] first thing in natural life? Water
[1:10:54] breaks, then blood comes, then life
[1:10:57] comes. The same elements came out of
[1:11:00] Christ that we go through to get back
[1:11:01] into his body. The first thing come,
[1:11:03] they spirited him in the side and water
[1:11:05] poured out. Blood came forth into thy
[1:11:08] hands I commend thy spirit
[1:11:11] life. First John 5:7 says, "There are
[1:11:14] three that bear record in heaven. The
[1:11:15] Father, the word, which is the Son, and
[1:11:17] the Holy Ghost. These three are one, but
[1:11:19] there are three that bear record upon
[1:11:21] the earth. The water, the blood, and the
[1:11:23] spirit." Amen. They're not They're not
[1:11:25] one, but they agree in one. You can't
[1:11:27] have the Father without having the Son.
[1:11:29] You can't have the Son without having
[1:11:31] the Holy Ghost. But when you can but you
[1:11:33] can be justified without being
[1:11:35] sanctified. Yeah. Or you can be
[1:11:37] sanctified without having the Holy
[1:11:39] Ghost. But when it's finished, both
[1:11:41] justification and sanctification and the
[1:11:44] seal of the Lord Jesus Christ by baptism
[1:11:47] is put on you, it's a finished work.
[1:11:54] The seal is a sign of a finished work.
[1:12:00] It's done. It's over. It's finished.
[1:12:07] We could go
[1:12:09] down. You say, "Well, what is the Holy
[1:12:11] Ghost a seal?" Yes. Another place,
[1:12:13] Ephesians 4:30 says, "Grieve not the
[1:12:15] Holy Spirit of God, where you're sealed
[1:12:17] until the day of your redemption."
[1:12:18] That's the genuine true Easter seal.
[1:12:20] Shows that sin has been paid for you and
[1:12:23] God has accepted you and you're sealed
[1:12:26] into Christ by the Holy Ghost. Sin is
[1:12:29] finished.
[1:12:32] Hello. Sin is finished. The eternal seal
[1:12:37] has been finished.
[1:12:40] Now, we're resurrected today. Why can't
[1:12:41] we have such a time over the things of
[1:12:43] God? Because we're resurrected. Those he
[1:12:45] forno, he called. Those he called, he
[1:12:47] justified. Those he justified, he has
[1:12:49] also glorified. Then now we we are now
[1:12:51] resurrected. We're resurrected from the
[1:12:53] inside out, not from the outside in. Did
[1:12:56] you notice? Not sealed out this way, but
[1:12:58] sealed in. So if you're sealed in, then
[1:13:01] that means the devil is sealed out.
[1:13:05] He would say in another place, the only
[1:13:07] way the devil can get get to you is you
[1:13:09] get out from behind that. He said
[1:13:12] otherwise he would have to come along
[1:13:13] the same process, amen, justified,
[1:13:16] sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:18] to get to where you are.
[1:13:24] That doesn't mean that he don't try.
[1:13:27] Doesn't mean he don't scratch at the
[1:13:28] door and howl in the windows,
[1:13:32] whisper things and say things and mind
[1:13:34] battles
[1:13:36] and fleshly
[1:13:38] things, striking at your flesh. But on
[1:13:42] the
[1:13:42] inside, ain't a devil in hell that can
[1:13:45] crack that seal and spoil the goods.
[1:13:50] People find themselves shattered and
[1:13:53] their faith gone and they've lost their
[1:13:56] way, turned their back on God. Yet they
[1:14:00] once believed. They once walked with us.
[1:14:02] They once sang with us. They once
[1:14:03] amended with us. They once took
[1:14:05] communion with us. They once went to the
[1:14:07] altars with us. They once was in prayer
[1:14:09] lines with us. But something happened
[1:14:11] along the way. What happened? They never
[1:14:14] was sealed.
[1:14:19] You know, somebody told this story and
[1:14:21] it always stuck with me about a fire in
[1:14:24] a house, you know, and fire the the most
[1:14:27] destructive thing about fire sometimes,
[1:14:29] not just the not the fire, it's the
[1:14:31] smoke that can get in everything. And
[1:14:34] they were going through this house and
[1:14:36] all the clothes smelt like smoke and the
[1:14:38] bed smelled like smoke and the walls
[1:14:39] smelled like smoke and everything else
[1:14:41] smelled like smoke. He said that finally
[1:14:44] he's just looking for a place that where
[1:14:46] smoke didn't get to and he found a
[1:14:48] couple of cans that had been
[1:14:50] sealed up peaches or something and he
[1:14:54] said I popped the seal on that and there
[1:14:57] was no smoke in there.
[1:14:59] There wasn't. He still had the smell of
[1:15:01] peaches or whatever it was that he he
[1:15:03] had in his hands. He said, "I realize
[1:15:05] what kept them from that was that seal."
[1:15:10] And we know in this age that we're
[1:15:12] living in, the smoke is coming up like a
[1:15:14] out of a great furnace and it's filling
[1:15:16] the air and people are getting infected
[1:15:18] by it and they're losing their vision
[1:15:20] from it and they're losing their ability
[1:15:21] to see from it and to walk and and to
[1:15:24] think, right? That's what happens in
[1:15:26] smoke. Hey, I could probably bring up a
[1:15:28] fireman right now could tell you all
[1:15:29] kind of things about the dangers of
[1:15:30] smoke. Smoke get in your eyes and you
[1:15:33] may not even be around the fire. There's
[1:15:34] been a lot of people killed just from
[1:15:36] inhaling the smoke
[1:15:39] and they find them and dead and laid out
[1:15:41] because their lungs wasn't built for
[1:15:43] that stuff and and it gets into there
[1:15:45] and it permeates on the inside and we're
[1:15:47] that's what we're seeing in this time
[1:15:48] that we're living in. People are walking
[1:15:51] in this place where smoke is filling the
[1:15:53] place.
[1:15:55] It's a revelation. And it's filling the
[1:15:56] atmospheres and it's filling our school
[1:15:59] rooms and it's filling our jobs and it's
[1:16:01] filling our governments and it's filling
[1:16:02] the whole world. And there's people that
[1:16:05] can are walking there and hailing and
[1:16:07] they're dying by the millions and the
[1:16:09] thousands are just falling by the
[1:16:10] wayside.
[1:16:12] But there's a certain group of people
[1:16:15] that are walking through the smoke.
[1:16:19] If you've been given the equipment to
[1:16:21] deal with it, amen, you can make it
[1:16:23] through. firemen put on things around
[1:16:25] their face and it's sealed off. They put
[1:16:27] on things, you know, uh protection
[1:16:29] equipment and they're able to go into
[1:16:31] places and save people. Why? Because
[1:16:33] they've been given something. And
[1:16:34] there's a people in this day that's been
[1:16:36] given a seal
[1:16:39] and they can walk through Leodia and
[1:16:42] they can walk through the smoke and the
[1:16:43] how and they can walk through the filth
[1:16:46] all around them and it not affect them.
[1:16:48] Why? Cuz they have been sealed by the
[1:16:50] seal of almighty God. And there ain't an
[1:16:53] ounce. Come on. There ain't a wisp of
[1:16:56] that smoke that can get inside that
[1:16:58] seal.
[1:17:01] They're sealed until the day of their
[1:17:11] redemption. We go on down as we get down
[1:17:14] to
[1:17:14] this. Sure, the devil will punch at you.
[1:17:18] He'll accuse you. He'll say things about
[1:17:20] you. He'll try to make you think that
[1:17:23] you're not.
[1:17:27] Oh yeah. But here's the key. You want
[1:17:30] the key? Don't listen to him.
[1:17:37] That's not That's not very hard. Don't
[1:17:40] listen to him. Tune him out.
[1:17:44] Tune into the things of God because you
[1:17:46] know you've passed from death unto life.
[1:17:50] You know the things that you once loved,
[1:17:53] you don't love them anymore.
[1:17:55] That's right. And you know that you
[1:17:58] believe every word of God.
[1:18:01] Hallelujah.
[1:18:03] Amen. I believe the token is a
[1:18:06] confirmation. It's the price has been
[1:18:08] paid. It's finished. It's done.
[1:18:12] We have our ticket to our eternal
[1:18:15] destination.
[1:18:18] Winds may blow.
[1:18:20] Demons may how. Satan will come with his
[1:18:23] mind battles. He'll come with his
[1:18:25] depression and his anxieties and his
[1:18:27] fears and his worries and the darkness
[1:18:29] of the
[1:18:31] smoke. But down on the inside is a seed
[1:18:34] that's been sealed.
[1:18:36] And it'll walk through every howling
[1:18:38] demon of hell. It'll walk through every
[1:18:40] spirit. It'll walk through every
[1:18:42] sickness. It'll walk through every
[1:18:44] problem. It'll walk
[1:18:47] because it's got a destination
[1:18:49] and it'll continue on. And if it goes
[1:18:51] down by the graveside, it'll come up
[1:18:54] again.
[1:18:55] It's a certified seed. It's going to
[1:18:57] come up. Hallelujah. I think about our
[1:19:00] sister Marilyn. We just had to bear and
[1:19:02] I was looking at that seed. Brother Tim
[1:19:04] mentioned about it being a seed and I
[1:19:05] think I said, "God, I'm so thankful we
[1:19:07] got certified seeds. has been germatized
[1:19:10] by the spirit of God that he may go down
[1:19:13] into death, but one day there's going to
[1:19:15] come a sound from heaven.
[1:19:17] And that seed is going to come up again.
[1:19:20] And she ain't the only one. There's
[1:19:21] going to be millions, no doubt, around
[1:19:23] the world that raise up again. Why?
[1:19:25] Because they have had that seal that
[1:19:28] sealed them until the day of their
[1:19:30] redemption.
[1:19:31] It's the earnest. It's the down payment
[1:19:33] of what we are going to receive. Oh
[1:19:35] yeah. Hallelujah. Let's bow our hearts
[1:19:37] today.
[1:19:42] the
[1:19:43] blood, the Holy Spirit, the
[1:19:49] seal. If you haven't followed that
[1:19:52] prescription with your whole heart, I I
[1:19:54] would say follow
[1:19:58] it. Go after it with
[1:20:00] everything. I must have it. Lord, I want
[1:20:04] to repent and I want to be baptized in
[1:20:07] your
[1:20:08] name that I can receive
[1:20:12] you. I must have you,
[1:20:17] Lord.
[1:20:19] Hallelujah. How many you just say, Lord,
[1:20:21] I must have you
[1:20:23] must have you, Lord. In my life, in my
[1:20:28] heart, every part, every place,
[1:20:31] I need you.
[1:20:34] Father, come to you today,
[1:20:38] Lord Jesus. We're needy of
[1:20:41] you. So thankful to have confidence and
[1:20:45] faith and such a power that can hold us
[1:20:48] in our darkest
[1:20:50] moments. Go through some hard things in
[1:20:53] life, some hard
[1:20:56] hits. Maybe somebody here tonight's been
[1:20:59] through some hard hits.
[1:21:04] Lord, they can surely say, look back and
[1:21:06] say, "It's
[1:21:07] held. It's held me." When I couldn't
[1:21:11] hold on no more, it held
[1:21:14] me. Oh,
[1:21:16] God. Lord, may you just come down, I
[1:21:19] pray, and touch each heart with your
[1:21:22] presence tonight,
[1:21:25] Lord. Move on the scene for your people,
[1:21:28] Father.
[1:21:29] Lord, there be somebody that don't know
[1:21:31] you tonight. May they find you, Lord.
[1:21:34] May they seek you with their whole
[1:21:35] heart. Lord, there's nothing in this
[1:21:37] world that's worth staying here
[1:21:41] for. There's nothing in this world worth
[1:21:45] trading you
[1:21:46] for. Lord, you're worth
[1:21:49] everything. Father, we ask, God, that
[1:21:51] you'll just have your
[1:21:53] way. Touch each heart. Touch each life.
[1:21:59] Lord, if there be something we've done,
[1:22:01] God, may we just go to start repenting
[1:22:03] for it right now and lay it at your feet
[1:22:06] and follow you, Lord, in
[1:22:10] the power and the resurrection of Jesus
[1:22:13] Christ. Seen every hand that was lifted
[1:22:16] all over this
[1:22:17] building. God, I I don't know if there's
[1:22:20] a person here that could truly say, "We
[1:22:22] don't need more of Jesus."
[1:22:25] Lord, we all need more of
[1:22:27] you. This church needs more of you. I
[1:22:31] need more of you,
[1:22:33] God. We all desire that tonight,
[1:22:36] Father. Lord, may you just come in a
[1:22:39] special way and touch each heart and
[1:22:40] each
[1:22:41] life. Ask it in Jesus
[1:22:44] name.
[1:22:46] Amen. Hallelujah. I need you,
[1:22:51] Lord. I need you, Lord. Lord, right
[1:23:00] now I need you, Lord.
[1:23:05] I need you. I need you right now.

[1:25:35] tonight, I'd be glad to pray with you.
[1:25:38] Whatever. Don't leave this place without
[1:25:40] him.
