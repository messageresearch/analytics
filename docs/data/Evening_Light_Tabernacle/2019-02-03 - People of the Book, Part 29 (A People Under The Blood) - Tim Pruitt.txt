presence here already among us as you just come down among the Saints today revealing yourself to the songs of praise Lord reminding us of a divine promise Norden there is a perfect image that image you have of us in your mind before the world began that word that spoke of us let us come and match that word Lord that's the oppening Lord that spirit body Lord for we have one waiting and I pray Lord you bless us today as we look into the word may you minister to hearts and lives and just open up our understanding God Lord that we can just see the hope of our calling let us find that vein of anointing and speak as an oracle of God in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you let's look over here hebrews chapter 9 and we're going to read from verse 1 this morning we just welcome you today as we're here in the name of the lord a man gathered together in his name that's his promise for us amen hebrews chapter 9 and verse 1 then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and the worldís sanctuary but there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Vail the tabernacle which is called the holiest of holies which had the golden censer and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold where ian was the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's rod that budded and tables of the Covenant and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly amen god bless you will that let you have your seat today we're going to be speaking about a people that is under the blood a man how many believes were people under the blood this morning a man Jesus of course would type out every Redemption promise in every manner I mean he was a perfect match peace to the Old Testament and the sacrificial lamb would portray him in almost every way possible first he would be born in a stable as a lamb and there would be shepherds there would be the first to find that the newborn lamb and this lamb would be killed upon the brazen altar and again that the brazen altar where the lamb was slain was not in heaven but rather it was the cross and even though it was a wooden cross it was represented as brass because of all the judgment of God was that was due to mankind was poured out upon him and there up on the altar of his cross he was crucified this is also typed as the brass serpent in the wilderness and you would wonder well how in the world could a brass serpent represent Jesus Christ but it represented it in this is that he became sin for us and he was crucified that paying the penalty of sin and it's the only cure for the serpent bite we know we are in this body because of the bite of the serpent a man that we were we were born in sin and shape and iniquity but jesus paid it all amen and we're people today of full Redemption we thank God for that but as we know brother Branham would tell was in the voice of the God in the last days he said it contrasts all Bible prophecies he was born in the spring like all lambs are born why was he born in a barn instead of a house he was a lamb why was he not just run up to the altar or the altar where he was nailed to the cross he was led to the cross you lead the Sheep to the slaughter and he was a lamb he was born when lambs are born in every way he would type the the Old Testament lamb as he would become the sacrifice to become wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquity many would think while he was just a man and as I said you as a man you've made yourself God and that's the reason that they crucified but no he was God and he made himself a man he died as a man but in doing so he became the sacrificial lamb upon the brazen altar of his cross and bore our judgment he came all the way from heaven so that he could make a way back from mankind and I want to emphasize this again this morning he came from heaven the Bible said in John 3:13 that he would say it like this he said no man can come down from heaven it's I except he that is in heaven and he said even the Son of Man which is in heaven so there again he he would say it no one could go into heaven except he that came down from heaven because heaven had been sealed off to mankind but he had to come from heaven so that he could make a way back for man aren't you glad that this one was not just content to stay in the heavens and forget the earth and man and forget us as his sons and daughters but rather he would come all the way from glory leave the father's throne and come here as a man to pay redemptions price to make a way back for you to go to heaven and and now so the Earth's of course was made to be an extension of heaven in fact in the millennium ahead in the new heavens and the new earth God will dwell with his people upon the earth actually as we have as we've often said the earth was made for man and it is here that God will dwell with his people and when Jesus came it was heaven coming down to man and it was God coming down as he did to Adam saying Adam Adams where art thou and it was God coming looking for that which he had lost a man and the the atmosphere between heaven and earth it had become clouded with a veil that was thicker than the temple veil I think is very amazing point that the Jewish people say that the veil of the temple was four inches thick but this veil between God and man that that covered the atmospheres that refused to let prayers to go up into heavens what demon powers would rule the the atmosphere as the Bible said that he is of a Satan as a prince of the power of the air or atmosphere and he controlled the atmosphere between God and man that would keep the communication from God to man and and God would consume condescend through that veil and he would take on a body that would be subject to time and that led supper eggs and pains and sorrow and troubles and he came here to make a way for the Wayfarer and man he came to make away for one like um Abraham and he came from that city that Abraham saw then looked far that he said whose builder and maker was God and and he came to he came to be the way to heaven that Jacob saw when he laid his head down upon that stone that day and there was a ladder descended from heaven and angels us and descending upon that ladder and it was all it was speaking of a way that God one day would when to open the heavens and open a way for mankind and God would step out of of heaven and come down to the earth to make a way for us to go back into his presence and he this is why you would say in John 14 I am the way I am the truth and I am the life because the truth is the way and the truth is the life and of course he heals the way in the truths and the life and he said no one can come up to the Father except by me this is the only way you'll ever get to heaven I think that's very important that we stand there on that position in a day and time like when one of the messengers to Sodom Billy Graham has said I'm you know I was quoted as saying I actually was in an interview where he said that that um it was really that there's all kinds of ways that you can come to God and Jesus is one of those ways he is not one of those ways he is the only way to God and that's through Jesus Christ hey man and so he would he would I'd sleep I want you to remember I you know I made him a statement the other day he didn't die in the heavens he did but he died on the earth but he actually his cross his altar was on the earth but he died there on that altar on that cross suspended between heavens and earth and he did it to make a way back for you and me I want you to notice he didn't die on the earth and he didn't die in the heavens he died in the place and to make a way there through that dimension in order that we could go there that that dimension could be open to us well that we could come into the presence of God it'll also be in that very place that very place that he came to Dimas as brother branham would say it that the the space that he came to redeem us that we will actually meet him in the air that very place in the district shows you them the way is going to be open and clear to the people of the end time to leave from this dimension here of life mattering time and go into that heavenly realm of the eternal T's so he would he would die between the heavens and earth to be the bridge through the atmospheres of darkness he said that no one can ascend into heaven except he that came down from heaven even the Son of Man which is in heaven you see the devil controlled dis atmosphere and it was a veil it was a veil of unbelief that clouded the atmosphere and placed this veil between God and man and it's you you think of them for its thick veil this is much more thicker than any temple veil and man it is the whole atmospheres of demon anointing and demon powers there to try to ward off the blessings of God and Jesus came thus through that very through through those veils of darkness that separated God and man's had become one of us now brother Branham Metellus fish in the mighty conquer he said did you ever know the Bible said he ascended on up on high far above every every through every heaven and this earth belong to the devil through the fall this earth was given to the devil every kingdom of this world is governed by the devil we hate to think that but the Bible says it is there so little spoke of this ascension it is one of the greatest days when he ascended up because all over the earth since that day in the Garden of Eden that sin was committed all heavens was shut off from mankind Satan is the Prince of the power of the air that's right why are the fall from heaven Oh Lucifer no one could see in the glory no man could understand because the power is just above us heaven means the atmospheres above it then all of these powers were shut off from mankind because of sin and you notice even the Old Testament Saints could not rise and go into his presence because there was not a blood yet that had been shed that could cleanse sin were that a single man could come into the presence of the Almighty God and now and again he was said there was a midst of sin over the earth the and the blood of bulls and calves and sheep could not atone for the human there they were kept in a place called Paradise there was a midst hanging over sin and they could not ascend up only that he only he that come down so so again this is very important for us understand this impenetrable mist of sin over the earth and there had to be a way back in the God's presence we've been speaking about the mercy seat it would be important that a man could go let's jump and say a man that could go and put his hands upon God and bridge the way between him and man who could intercede it would be the same words that I say it would say and I saw that there was no man and I wondered that there was no intercessor and so because there was no man that could redeem us God himself takes on the form of human flesh in order to pay the price of redemption to make a way for you into God's presence now as brother Adam said as he rose there that days that I think of him well that when he had risen from the dead that morning that he had his own blood as a high priest and he went beyond the vales through ever sphere Satan in times past had men blocked off from heaven he could not get in contact with heaven and but when Jesus took his blood the first veil here it was the veil of death and the veil of the grave and then the veil in the temple and then the veil of sickness and the veil of fear and then every bill that there was an unveiled God to man hallelujah this is what it means are the breaking of the veil I meant the veil of Jeff the veil of the grave the veil in the temple the veil of sickness the veil of fear and every veil that you can name a man he triumphs over every one of them to make a wave back into the presence of God for you and me what a redeemer he went way way in above heavens of the heavens and this was seated on the right hand of God and sat down as they finished work that's right above all and there he opened a channel and God used to come down through those corners of heaven and talk to mankind in the Garden of Eden and Satan by sin block them but the great high priests I want you to get a picture of this the great eye priests with his anointed with his blood went through every veil and ripped her open and cleared out the skies again that God and man could be father and son and communed again with one another what a marvelous thing and I don't think we fully catch the real significance of it all makes make God is open our hearts this morning and her eyes and understanding to realize what has been done oh my god making a way for your fellowship God make it away whether there would be no sin no darkness nothing to separate you from the love of God hey mal notice now as we as we share you just a little more in the Hebrews chapter 2 the the Bible said he ascended on high and gave gifts to men and there was an atmosphere hung over the earth of darkness a gloom of death and a weary and that the Pereira's couldn't come up because here torment wasn't me but he broke through that veil he opened up the way and he opened up the veil of sickness he broke the veil of sin he broke the veil of worry a man he broke the veil of depressed depression that comes with worry he broke every veil that he made a highway for the wayfarer men walking up and down the king's highway pay man oh listen to the word this morning ever veil is broke you know you know what it hears every every time you go to start believing that never wants to come in and try to keep you from believing bring a veil of worry and within the veil of depression and a veil of doubt but I want you to know every one of them's already been conquered and you have a right to break through every veil ever fail of kendricks ever fail of Jack I had to break through and aquiline it delivered in the salvation the Holy Ghost yes everything you meet up he fades away Alleluia brother he's a mighty Conqueror hey man look at him as his tensor and after he rose from the dead then we noticed that as he went on then after he talked with his disciples the Bible said he ascended up on high what did he do he took he was here come down the logos from heaven remember in the beginning was the word the logos the Word was with God the Word was God and he comes there from the low costume and as the word becomes flesh he was come down here the logos from heaven when he went and when he went back he took with him the high priests being a high priests anointed oh listen with the torch light of his own but a man when he went down there over these powers had been here that accused it wouldn't let God and man fellowship it had been broke in Eden now want you to keep these things in mind now hold hold these thoughts real close to you he comes and and now he did his work as the Lamb he died on the cross on the brazen altar but now he raises as a high priest and he's going to start a priestly work of redemption of atoning because this one isn't just the Lamb he is also the high priest because he's taken his own sacrifice bigger than the Lamb himself and then taken his are birth and he's ascending now all through all of these veils of darkness into the mercy seat to shine a light of mercy and went right there into the mercy seat to put his own blood upon the seat of mercy my wedding Redeemer now send up the thing say tonight the Dominion domain of this earth was Satan it belonged to the devil but when he become the anointed High Priest else and then he gives a little illustration here as Aaron the high priests went into the holiest of Holies behind the veil anointed with the precious and on and on walk in a certain way playing holy holy holy unto the Lord as he walked in as a type of Christ with the blood of the Lamb before him and if when if he too went any other way he would have died now remember this is Aaron Aaron if he to win any other way that through the blood of a lamb he first would after all for a lamb for his own sense then he would have to wash in the lather and go through cleansing of wash his hands in his feet and then he would take the blood off of that altar and there he would dare mix there with it the coals off of the altar into the altar of incense and then he would take the blood that he was carrying and off of that lamb and he would carried into the holiest of Holies and he would anoint the four corners of our Noah every part of the the the mercy seat seven times and pour the remainder right down in front of the altar are you with me now he was doing this to make an atonement for sin amen but Jesus he is a greater high priest he didn't have any sins but he paid for the sins of the whole world and he became the sacrifice and on the brazen altar of his cross the judgments of God was poured out upon him well if you can just get a picture of it you know you never have to go through the judgment but Simmons there he paid it all hallelujah once and for all a man paid it all so that you could go free hallelujah now you could go free just like marabous yet and continue being a Barabbas he paid the price but then it comes back to you to have to go back to that same thing and accept that atonement somebody with me now what's this Aaron the high priest went in the holiest of holy behind the veil anointed with the precious anointing oil walk in a certain way the bells and the pomegranates around his garments would play holy holy unto the Lord he walked in as a type of Christ with the blood of the Lamb before him he went the other way he would die but Christ with his own blood as high priests anointed with the power of God raised from the dead and tore down the Dominion of Satan and he broke the domain in it when the heavens beyond heavens and he was come to the lowest of the earth and received up into heaven and God set him on a pinnacle until he has to look down to see heaven amen no wonder he's a mighty Conqueror as he stands younger today in the domain for ever and ever now Isaiah said unto us a son is born unto us a child has given his name to be called counselor Prince of ISA mighty God the everlasting father and of his domain there should be no end for ever and ever he will reign on the throne of David seating in the heavens of heavens far above every angel archangel every principality and power he tore down and spoiled at his crucifixion and resurrection everything Satan had he broke through that a sin he toured apart with a high priest blood of his own body he come next what was it was the valence sickness held over the people he tore it apart a man a man for he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed then he went through the Great Valley under of sickness a great the great veil of sin he went through the great veil of worry he went through the great veil of fear and he toured every one of them down and a Sidon on so high and received a name above every name that is named in the heavens on the earth or in the world to come hey man aren't you glad for that think about Redemption think about what he did for you when he ascended on high brother you know that a lot of people are preaching about the cross and what he did at the cross but what about his ascension when he made a way in the heaven for you yeah at the cross he took your judgment but they're in dissension he made a way for you through the blood of Jesus Christ God taking that lovely one who had stooped down so low that he didn't even have a place to be born or a place to die and God exalted him on high and gave him a crown of glory yonder and the name above every name there he said today that mighty Concord since he read the mail into the veil of sin was ran into the veil of sickness was ran into every veil that kept man away from God was ran into I am the way the truth and the life he broke every power he scattered every devil and he made a searchlight from glory hey man what a Concord that he is and I'll tell you what this mornin he still the mighty conquers all you have to do his name a name his name is greater his name is higher come on everything else has to bow to his name every enemy has to come bow down at his footstool oh man he won't fire listen let me tell you he not only triumph over the sins of the world he come to triumph over your sins and I'm we're aware that the sin in your life he conquers it then it becomes his footstool in other words he takes possession over you do the same thing with the sickness in your body so he was wounded for your transgressions bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes we were healed what a word of promise that is a man give me just a little more sound here now so he broke every power broke ever domain made that search light from glory brother branham sent no prophet and he stung by Jacob here when he laid down there on the bed of stone that night and his pillar of stone he saw angels ascending and descending notice in the first place it was descending and ascending but this time it was God in man ascending and descending on the ladder of Jacob as we call it where he broke every power thought every domain sets at the right hand of the Majesty on high far above everything the channel of the Holy Ghost in this dark world is laying over open for root so ever may will make comment be baptized into this great channel of his blessings and receive the redemptive blessings that he died for what a savior what a redeemer now this is what brother Brennan said you can't walk outside this veil you've got to come in here and find out every person now has to come behind the veil you've got to break through that veil of worry depression unbelief doubt hey man if you want God's blessings you got to break through it then you say brother Jim how can I do it well it's already conquered all you have to do is come through the way through Jesus your conquer it's already been opened it ain't you happen to do it is it's God's already done it for you you just get on the ladders walk up man you just climb up by faith until you come into God's presence and then you realize I am it blood wash blood block son or daughter of the Living God I am the blood right now to come into this presence to come boldly not timidly not a beggar knowledge not mother's an intruder but I'm coming as his bride he's chosen his he left his lap and I'm walking into his presence to uh to tell to tell de tell him what the devil has been doing to you I'll tell you what just go ahead grab him by the hair of the head one huh bring on that old demon of worry or that demon of depression rapaho come on drag him up in the COTS presence this thing's been bothered me this sickness this for matter this is a day listen we've had enough of the devil accusing us before God it's time you accuse the devil before you know he died at Golgotha it's called the place of the skull we learned when we was over in Israel that you know they had they have word the garden tomb yes and is there where on gordon's calvary is what it's called because a british man by the name of Gordon this you know discovered this part of course the Catholic Church have got their own their own Calvary in their own their own that cave and and and so on but there they thought it was it was the place in this call because there was limestone that had been eaten out look like two eyes and maybe a sunken nose to hollow eyes look like up on the side of the he listen right up there is were that Jesus died and over here just down Vermeer is where that took him and buried him and it's not not a very very far at all with a whether garden tomb is but when you go and you compare the pictures the photographs of a hundred years ago erosion is made to eyes much larger than the nose look much larger and in just a hundred years it has changed so dramatically that it is hardly even like the picture that was taken a hundred years ago so they begin to research a little bit in the Bible because you know this was called the place of the skull for some reason and it was alongside a busy highway and you were reading in the Bible yourself that David when he killed Goliath he cut off his head and then the Bible said he took his head up to a certain healed close to Jerusalem there and he hung the head of Goliath so that everybody could pass him by could look over there and see Goliath is dead and Goliath is conquered [Applause] hallelujah this is where that Jesus was crucified I'm Anna there in the busy way of the highway there above the highway you can pass by and look at the three crosses as you come by and you can see sin has been judged now there it is here an ever veil into you got you can't walk outside of this whale you got to come in here and find out you got to get here where there's nothing between you and God were the angels of God can descend and ascend back and forth bringing the messages of God back and forth to the individual there's nothing between my soul and my Savior the point said there he set the mighty conquer here a never-failing to he rent the veil that you can be saved he rent the veil that if you have committed adultery if you have cursed if you have done anything wrong he ripped that veil for you that stick Oh his somebody tuned in this morning that stick that Satan holds over you whatever the name of it is come on here is it if you only save him hallelujah glory to God that means every sin is under the blood hallelujah once you remind the devil then you don't have any sins and that he's aligned to you telling you that you got sins I tell you your sins have been paid for that jet is over with but not only that it is so admiring it till it's back on the head of your accuser if you have a prophet saying you never place [Applause] but Sigma's never attributed to you as a predestinated seed and never was your sin it's not associated with your name hallelujah if you're sick today how many have been sick how many's got a need in your body if you're sick today the doctor says you can't get well he went he rent that veil into and everything broke him before God he will ever veil he tears down every domain and he sits there the mighty conquer since he rent the veil into but brother tell my problems different it ain't just a sickness i i've got a war out joint I've got a but I've got a problem you know in my shoulder I I've got this situation here listen the same one who created in the beginning can recreate again hey man what do you think had to happen when brother branham prayed for that man that was blind and he had no eyeballs in three days had formed a man I would start looking for something to start forming in my shoulder in my neck in my hip in my heart my lungs in my body no matter where I'm afflicted we forget sometimes who we are what the blood is done for us what Cowra means and this is what the message was to do to bring you back to the original atonement and show you the power of it not to be turned into a weak and powerless Church but a church full of power hey man I don't know exactly how I I can't come up on me on the other day but it popped up again just a little clip of that service February the 20th which sister Alana was healed now a year ago and they're there in that service you remember remember she she rejoiced in that victory that we received in Jesus because I was preaching God is doing some extreme things and he's turning a people back to Bible faith to Bible doctrine Iman's to Bible word and Bible action and Bible days you're too full remember that service and all be in your heart forever amen and you know what happened there is we was singing leaning on the everlasting arms she began just to run in victory around this church went back the next day the very next day for clear skin now in that very same service you may remember this is home to some tape it's only video that some weeks prior to that I had got a little little email from a little brother over in South Africa a little preacher there I don't know him he just has written me several times through the years and you know when he wrote me this time you know I I thought you know he just said brother Tim would you just pray for me I desperately need a job and jumps are very difficult to come by in in South Africa very difficult and you know they've got three races of people they have to black the Africans and they have the colours which are the the mix of people from Malaysia and workers and whatever else and and they're called colored people and then they have another which is the white people come from Muslim most of them were were from a believer Dutch people and they speak it that's language but he said but you know with with the changings of the laws it makes it makes it very hard for people of color up here you know the colored people and there and like I said they're not Africans they're just a mixed race of all Malaysian everywhere coming maybe maybe even some African but anyway they've been there for several hundred maybe four hundred years I don't know probably as long as we have here in America and and so you know we're all pressure has come down to to try to bring equality and so you know the blacks now the original Africans have the priority and the hiring and then the then the colored and then the whites and there's a lot of people that are fleeing that country because of extreme poverty and no jobs and corruption and governments and so you know I've been unable to get a job for four months for several years it was in extreme poverty and his wife had come down with a condition where she had the third stage rectal cancer so she even he writes me and he said you know brother Jim I'm in desperate situation my I don't have a job I've been living with my in-laws and we just barely make it and I need help my brother I I need some help well my heart goes out to them you know but I mean you know take all the dollars that I have in my pocket and spreading around the poor in the world they don't go very far and so you know I thought well what can I do to help this man and I knew what I could do I said send me your address and I'll send you a prayer cloth and you remember I took that prayer cloth in my hand that day and prayed over it and I claimed the blood that was shed at Calvary for that need and I asked for a job for that man and for him to be able to get out of that poverty I'm preaching to you this morning I don't care how how what you out desperate your situation is God is filled God you say but you don't know mine yeah you don't know either there's nothing there's this is my god he'll supply all your needs did you hear me saying all of your needs amen he cares about the sparrow he cares about you man and there I prayed for that me dev for that little little sister for that little preacher and he wrote me back the other day and and I already heard from him but I'm just getting a new report and he said I just want you to know my wife has had a miraculous healing the doctor has dismissed her for two he said I've got a job with the Advocate Agriculture Department and said even there God held a job open from my why but the whole year while she was sick and didn't feel a position so that she would have a job and she's back to work and we're all that way to recovery and walking in deliverance that's a country that concludes under that and I remarked about that sister a sister laminator victory laps around the church and I said she's like Miriam she's having a victory dance because her enemy is dead and I'd say again and I said your your Yemeni is dead and three times I said your enemy is dead and another little brother writes me from South Africa for over a decade I've been struggling with an issue and I just been praying God if I could just hear those words my enemy is dead and I turned them to that service that morning and I heard those words your enemy is dead and I'm just a find that my enemy is dead he died upon the altar of judgment upon the cross and he was killed here a man and he bore Ireland permanece but however then he comes the high priests as Melchizedek in the order of Melchizedek and with the torchlight of his song blood he ascends into heaven and goes behind the veil is somebody with me now into the mercy seat turn on it with mud and there makes an atonement for sin and he doesn't leave the mercy seat he sits there come on Church interceding until the last name that the book is manifested upon here and that name is dipped in blood before he leaves that seat of mercy before it turns that everything that's felt he'd be filthy still he this holy be holy still and people are locked in their limbo amen before that happens he's been waiting hey man hey man he couldn't wait any longer on you Justin he went out and got you amen he he may not wait any longer on you this morning he's a God rich in mercy you said but I'm too far down and despairing unbelief brother Jim this dot say through the adder boat he can reach further down then what a man can look at [Applause] [Applause] he became a priest not in the order of Aaron he didn't qualify he will have been born a Levite but he wasn't here of a earthly order he was a high priest of a heavenly order and he comes in the order of Melchizedek with the torch light of his own blood and a sins into the heavens and went behind the veil to the mercy seat to anoint it with blood and make an atonement for sin and he sends a sign back to the earth that he's done it by ripping the tip of veil and I'm ensuring the way has been made into the holiest of Holies and now mercy is there and grace is free and there can be multiplied to you and me now the book of Revelation speaks of two altars one of the altars the throne of God I called it that comes brother Branham called it that and it's called the altar of Mercy or the mercy seat the other is the altar of incense you say well wonder what about his brass altar it was on the it was the cross the throne of God is the golden altar upon which he sits as a mediator between God and man I'm just gonna share some of snippets right here from the first seal and we're going to share this together he said if there's no sacrifice on the altar then the prayers cannot be received so our prayers can only be received because of the work that Jesus did at Calvary it's only by the blood of the sacrificial altar that lets the prayers go through to God and then he tells us that this blood has been applied to the seat of Mercy in heaven so it wasn't just him on the cross that the blood was shed but he takes the blood now into the holiest of Holies what's this his brother Branham calls it in the Vasile the fifth seal is open there see see many other things if you caught as him waiting on questions come to see by all right now where the ark what's the word art art is art to the Covenant the altar of incense the this the altar the brass altar is not called the Ark right the Ark is the art of the testimony Testament were Ian wherein is a mercy seat in under the covering of that mercy seat of the two chairman's is where the word he is amen if so he's laid right there the ten commandments right in the Ark and Jesus sits upon the throne of mercy is somebody with me so he said where the Ark the slain wounded bleeding bloody lamb for atonement for these odorous prayers so again he went in there to the mercy seat to do want to make a way so that we could have fellowship with God again somebody helping me bracelet so notice he calls the Ark in the Ark of the Covenant the throne of God the mercy seat the brazen altar was his cross but the mercy seat is worse his blood atones as he said where was the ark the slain the wounded bleeding bloody lamb for atonement for these orders prayers so you see he was on he was City above the arc of testimony which is the mercy seat notice now the arc is the mercy seat now brother branham tells us in Revelation chapter 4 verse and he says sprinkle it nice quoting the scripture here where they was to sprinkle it eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times they remember why that's far and he says isn't that beautiful seven times toward the east what is it the seven churches shall be covered with by a man a man is that wonderful to know we hear in the last days and there's a spring clean of blood for that I say hallelujah what is that that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the Aged to prepare people for the rapture because you can't be raptured without blood and the blood the Holy Spirit is the life of the book the seventh Church ages shall be covered by blood hallelujah Jesus blood just as sufficient in it yesterday today and forever and to ever age oh I love this to save every sinner he will ever seek person bring every miracle ever sign the pass seven times way back yonder in the Old Testament fourteen hundred and ninety years before Christ came think of it symbol seven times shall so he's showing you know fourteen hundred and seven years even before there there was a seven sprinkling of the blood speaking of how that God would through the seven ages have seven sprinklings of blood that would be the life of Christ for every age that's why I keep telling the brother you couldn't go trying to go beyond the seventh church age to another age because you're in another age there's no black there and without blood there's no rapture there hey man you so what brother Tim we're in the bride age that's right that's the seventh age the bride age where the seventh angel comes and sounds his message pulls us out of Pentecostal tradition into there back into the original Pentecostal word let me just say it it's unfortunate that they got the name Pentecost hey man that's right it's unfortunate they got that name because it brings a confusion there wasn't Pentecost they were still an extension of sanctification which is which is under Methodists Amen but we're coming here now to the blood age we're coming right here to the time of rapture age were the life of the blood now is made manifest by the baptism not not a baptism not an anointing but the true baptism of the Holy Ghost now so seven times out then he shall kill the goat to sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil to do with that blood as he did with the blood of Bullock's sprinkling upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat and he shall make an atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanliness of the children of Israel because of their trespasses in all their sins and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them that is in the midst of their uncleanness what was it the mercy seat what are they now and they're inside the ark was what the law and the law to trespass one commandment was to die without mercy but the problem is this is what the law says and the problem is all it sinned nobody could be perfect until a sinless wind come but being that you could have mercy the blood had the lay on the altar and they sprinkled the mercy seat and the mercy seat is the altar were you kneel and ask for mercy oh now listen to this here a tile across the land god forbid that we ever take it from our churches the old-fashioned altar what men can kneel and call on God for mercy and mercy is rich and flowing free from the blood of the Lord Jesus now also that's the mercy that's the mercy seat aren't you glad hey man I want to be a church that has a mercy seat has an altar that people can come and find grace in the time of need exactly right we don't want to be an altar list Church we want to church say that has a seat at mercy man what mercy is flowing out save whosoever will let him take the water of life freely now we want to see Jesus brother Brendan said in awakening Jesus he said we want to see Jesus I want to see now we know that his body will not return to the earth until he comes for his church because it must remain there for sacrifice is that right it must be upon the altar he sets on the throne of God now he's making clear what they alter that he's sitting upon because his altar of sacrifice the brazen altar was at Calvary but here he is sitting there not not on a brazen altar continuously dying for sin he died once and for all but there he sits on the throne of God which is the altar all right and and he said must remain for bhaiya stripes he is the sacrifice and the sacrifices on the altar and his body cannot come but his life return that it was in Christ come back up on the church in the form of the holy spirit and the holy spirit now so you can see very clearly brother Branham talks about this throne of God is his altar notice I want you to get this because this is going to be a very special point brother Branham takes us in the church age book to the seven golden lampstands and he tells us how they were lived how that there would be fire for every age and we are people that must not let the fire go out alright so the lamp was lit in a special way first the priest took fire from the sacred altar which was originally little I did by the fire of God he lit first of all the lap that was sitting at the top of the bowl then he lit the second lamp from the flame of the first the third lamp received his fire from the second lamp and all as did the fourth receive it from the third and so on until all the seven lamps were burning this holy fire from the altar being passed from the lap tonight is a wonderful type of the Holy Spirit in the seven churches hallelujah notice now the original outpouring of Pentecost which I poured came direct from Jesus well on the back see seat is it doing his church to all seven ages and so important to say m-- yesterday today and forever that never changing God in his essence in his ways and hallelujah this morning we are the people of the seventh flame [Applause] and where did that fire come from it came from the original fire that came down from that they are pinnacle that it come down from the fire CC from the very altar of God Oh hallelujah you remember when it lit your life you remember when that happened it lit your life and then in that fire from the mercy seat that blood is also fire it's a living fire is the pillar of fire it's the love God since the word hey man it's Alpha and Omega beginning in the end and then its original Pentecost when that original fire of God the pillar of fire comes down into your life when he said that since my beloved son I pleased to dwell in this one he surrendered his life to me anyone come to you surrender your life hey man then the same thing that happened with Jesus happens with you you go forth into power the Holy Ghost you overcome temptation you go out casting out Devils speaking with new tongues come out healing the sick is that right that's the kid that is that is the commission that God gave his church never get away from that the high priests this high priests was both sacrifice and priest he was no woolly lamb but he was the Lamb of God you know that must have been a strange title when John's walking along in this and that day I'm preaching along the River Jordan and he looks out there and he sees the light hanging over a man and he says behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world I must have been a strange title they were and they were not used to a man being the Lamb of God hey ma'am but they didn't know it was portrayed all the way back from Abraham because you see jewy Jews was they did not believe in and receive human sacrifices but God tells Abraham go and sacrifice your son hey man I don't let him go through it but he want him to type out what will happen one day when the when the Lamb of God would come to take a way to send the world and he would be a man and it would be God's Son oh I think I think when he saw that lamb hung up there that Ram hung up biased ram's horn and caught right there that had been spoken to existence you know Jesus was a child spoken to existence this this Ram had been spoken to existence was being held there you see it's in the Bible and man they said the Lord God will provide for himself a sacrifice that right and there was with his own lips here speaking the RAM the sacrifice into existence and there there as he goes to slay his son he god holds his hands that don't do it but there comes a prophecy that says Joe of Aegina and it says on the Mount of the Lord it's a VC another words this scene will be replayed again oh that's very mountain Lord of God he wouldn't die in Jerusalem he would die on Mount Moriah right out of Jerusalem come on church very very same place that Abraham had brought his son Isaac to offer here God now brings his own son Oh Isaac's coming along I like to I like to think of it as he comes along and he's bearing the wood firing the wood for his sacrifice and it's there now I think he knew what it meant to go to church you know your attitude toward Christ's gonna have a huge impact on your children a man you know sometimes people say well brother him I'm really strict well why don't you be strict about going to church Jesus was it was his custom hey man somebody said the other day well why you know you brother tell me you've spoke all about assembling and a lot of people were gone said what do you did that you're preaching to those that was there no now I'm preaching to you who wasn't here and I'll catch the next ones later a man is a very integral part of our life of our Christian duty Jesus went to the synagogue as was his custom a man and so he here here again we we have a custom even brother Branham would say you know he got onto some of his people for hanging out their laundry out on Sunday and and the woman's got back at him Zion legalists he said you better be legal when it comes to going to church that's one time you want to be a legalist and then you come there every time the door is open and if it ain't in your heart pray until that happens pray to God changes something right but here he goes now all of that was free here he goes now going on his way up today to the place that I will show you could meet a city mountain had to be on a certain place Isaac buried the load of the word along on his back trudging up the mountain father here's the wood here's the fire where's the sacrifice he knew the order of the sacrifice a man he knew what it was required he'd been to church and he said we got to have a sacrifice and he he says the Lord Himself will provide one so he gets a you know he he speaks that realm into existence he's calls it Jehovah Jireh on this mountain shall be seen now what was he doing he was praying when God would have a son when God would become human it was said he wasn't a man negatives of God he was God making himself a man and so he comes there upon the earth now to pay pay redemptions price and and and Isaac is typing it out prophesying that on one day on the same mount God will provide another lamb and it will not be a woolly lamb but it'll be a lamb without blemish a lamb without sin a sinless Lamb the only man that could do it his only one born without sexual birth he's only one not born in sin he was the only one that that could pay redemptions price it was not even the blood of man it was created blood so is the blood of God somebody with me now hey man now notice he he become both sacrifice and priest no woolly lamb but he would come and take to take away the sin of the world as high priests he was not he was never presented in your Bible as of that lineage of Aaron nor was he of the tribe oh wait a minute for he was of the tribe of Judah you see and that was the lineage of kings and Levi couldn't be a king in a king could not be a Levite but this high priest was the order of Melchizedek and Melchizedek was a priest king hey man he was king of Salem priest of the Most High God a man without father without mother without being getting a day's or ending of life he abideth the priest continually and Jesus was made in that order to be a continual high priest somebody with me now now the Bible would tell you where he ascended I'm gonna I'm gonna just kind of nail this down for you this morning I want you to get it New Testament doctor I mean believes were to preach what Paul preached New Testament treats we don't have a new message it didn't change because of prophet King hey man you said well the seals are open well the seals only made the Bible a new book didn't write a new Bible it didn't tear pages out of it it just made that word to live a mouth now it brought to us it brought to us the the interpretation of the parables now Hebrews 9 and verse 24 for Christ is not entered into the holy place made with hands which are the figures the true but into heaven itself to appear in the presence of God for us now we can see where he went he didn't go into a holy place that's the holiest of holies by the way he didn't go into the holiest of holies made with hands he went into heaven itself to appear in the presence of God for us now here's a mediator when you couldn't go he went hey man no not yet that he should offer himself often is a high priest entered in the holy place every year with the blood of others so the blood he would take the blood of others meaning sheep and goats and bulls and he would walk into there on a yearly basis on the day of atonement somebody help me bridge for he says but then but then he even must he be he often have suffered since the foundation world but now once in the end of the world have him appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself so this is why he appears into the heavens he does it and so the very moment of the tearing of the veil at the moment of Jesus death it dramatically symbolizes that his sacrifice the shedding of his own blood was a sufficient sacrifice and that it had opened the way into the holiest of holies and now it was open for all people book Jew and Gentiles and now God comes and plain of you the veil is open were that you can boldly approach him and find the Grace and the strength that you need in the time of needs hey man oh my as he died remember when he died Stephen looked up and he saw Jesus is that right as Stephen was dying he heavens open and he got a glimpse of it and he saw the mercy seat and he said I see Jesus standing at the Father's right hand Amen because he didn't see the father the father is invincible but he saw Jesus the visible image of the invisible God spending and power and authority hey man now this is New Testament doctrine New Testament doctrine did the Apostles doctrine the one that heaven witnessed that Paul preached and that brother branham preached the same this is this is Bible teaching they were positive they knew word Jesus went I'm driving this home because I want you to see it in the Bible here's what we believe where Jesus went when he ascended Matthew 2244 the Lord said unto my lord sit down my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool so already there's an Old Testament prophecy laying there that he's going to be sitting on his right hand no God hasn't got a great big right hand Jesus is sitting on right but what he's got is that is a metaphor of power and authority and no one can approach the invisible God without coming through the man Christ Jesus and his shed blood some witness somebody with me now now and Jesus Jesus now answering Pilate said unto Him thou has said nevertheless I send you hereafter so you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven so he Jesus knew now where he would go he would go and sit on the right hand of power so now we get an understanding what the right hand is it's oh the power Jesus that all the power in heaven and earth is given under my hand now if there's two God's the other and don't have me any power is that right because he said all the power is given into my hand what they are not seeing this God just changed his mask the Jehovah of the Old Testament is that Jesus of the knew God was only changing his mask from God to man now then he says again here after sadness son a man sit on the right hand of the power of God so again the right hand of the power of God so we get understand that what that metaphor metaphorically this means it means the right hand means the power of God he would be the power authority everything that would be done would be through his name of the family would be named Jesus everything in word or deed we would do it in the name of Jesus every demon has survived through the name of Jesus every tongue has to confess that Jesus is Lord come on somebody everyman now so again the Son of man shall sit on the right hand of the power of God notice now look at this next next part we notice that notice this next part which is marked 16 and verse 19 so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God now notice where he goes he has paid redemptions price the wrath is poured out on him on the cross on his brazen altar and he goes to sit on the right hand of God which means there the approach to God the power of God no one can come because he becomes the way the truth the life somebody with me now so he sits on the right hand of God notice now this is New Testament doctrine we're gonna go to Peters sermon on the day of Pentecost we all know acts 2:38 but let's look at some of us some of his sermon you men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs oh ma listen if that's what approved Jesus don't you know that's what's got to prove his church hey man I you know now you hear people today say I wouldn't give a care about I don't give a care about miracles you better hey man you better men that are approved of God there's miracles signs and wonders a church that's approved of God there's miracle signs and wonders in fact I say if they're not miracles and signs and wonders and churches a dead church it's a bloodless Church remember cozy under the blood there is miracles there is healing there is deliverance hey man so so again a man approved a God among you by miracles and wonders and science God which God did him in the midst of you as you yourselves know him being delivered by the determinate counsel and the foreknowledge of God you have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God hath raised up having loosened the pains of death because it was not possible that he should behold another oh my for David speaketh concerning I foresaw the Lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad and moreover did my flesh rest and hope because thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither was I suffer thine Holy One to see corruption Oh hallelujah if I could drive something home to you just a minute don't you realize this repeats again don't you realize there's gonna be some alive and remain at the coming Lord that he also spoke there are people that would be on his right hand of power and authority somebody help him a man who who was always before him whose hearts rejoice and tongue was glad and the flesh rests in this hope because he will not leave our soul here in this hell right now she's freed estimated not had to bring that in right here thou has made known to me the ways of life thou to make me and known thou shalt make me full of joy with our countenance therefore men and brethren let me speak let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David they look dead and buried and his Sepulchre is with us unto this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with him with an oath to him that the fruit of his loins according his flesh he would raise a Christ to sit on his throne he's seeing this notice where he's gonna sit on his throne new testament doctor he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption this Jesus had God raised up where are we're all witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and I haven't received to the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has said for this which he now ends here so he said the Holy Ghost comes by him sitting there on the throne amen because that's the blood of God the very life that was under blood the spirit come back on the day of Pentecost let's go now to Ephesians 1 in 19 let's just see if Paul teaches us and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us were to believe according to the working of his mighty power which you were out in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places far above oh listen how far he is above all principality and power and might and Dominion Oh hallelujah and every name that is named just named the demon named the trouble go before the throne in name come on here's about that name he is an authority above that one then at the name of Jesus Vesta he's ruler he's Lord they gotta obey Him hallelujah and when we invoke his name standing in his stead they got obey us - that's why he said in my name cast Satan out I'm preaching to a bunch of separate bruisers this morning a bunch of devil defeatist oh the ones there know that they're under the blood and the Prophet could see coming and warn the devil say that be careful there's a people the rise of people who know their God who will do exploits hey man far above all principality and power and might and Dominion every name that is named not only in this world but also in the world to come and he put all things under his feet hallelujah your troubles under his feet you are his victory a man and David look now look look at this put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church notice now that's his body so if it's under his feet and you're his body somebody help me now then it's underneath your feet now I'm preaching to a triumphant Church a victorious church that God says to you that thing that has been tormenting you is under your feet that the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet hallelujah winnette what we said the other day when that demon was cast out the lily bouquet she testified of the other night man what was it we come right out there and said you know why you know what happened we were under her Romans 8:34 who is he that condemneth hallelujah hallelujah that's what some spirits speak out and say you can have her I say shut up we don't have to hear you talk we in haven't you talking in this church we've heard enough of you you've had your say you've done your dirty deeds your own actions condemn you and we don't have a room for you to say nothing shut up take the minion over the thing Amen who is he that condemneth a man it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God and also make it Saturn's Mars so sad I've never met without listening to you anymore well let's do the one who's making intercession birth back here yes by a man Colossians 3:1 if you be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God look at this this is New Testament doctrine this is what this is what the Apostles believed this is where Jesus sat Hebrews 1 and 3 who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person of holding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high but this is Scripture after scripture you see the whole book of Hebrews is showing that he has went behind the veil into the holiest of holies making a way for all of us to come there he entered by his own but not the blood of animals Hebrews 8 in 1 now of the things which we have spoken this is the son I'm going to sum it up of all the things I've said here is the supper Bell we have such a high priest amen oh this is a summary of our message we have a high priest come on if we got the same summary that the New Testament church had amen and we come to the same conclusion and we sum it all up we're gonna have to sing like they said we have a high priest everything's all the reads that we can overcome the reason we can defeat sin that reason we can have heat is because we have a high priest that's the reason we're going into rapture because we have a high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens pretty clear what they believed Hebrews 10 12 but this man and we have talked about all kinds of priests and Aaron it works and this and that in the other what they did in the Old Covenant but then he comes but this man but this man when he met a demon he cast it out when when he met sin he defeated it when he met the devil in the wilderness he overcame him a man everywhere he went Doom Devils were starting to run and back in him instead come on him begging them a man he he was they were begging him don't cast us out before our time and Jesus let him know listen you can be cast out before your time that's why we can have divine healing come on that's why we can rebuke sickness come on somebody Amen because you say well it's his time to go well bill now was 91 years old and it was time to go but he cast him out anyway come on and sickness had to go before his time even when his time was up amen he stood triumphant what's now now now what's but this man after he'd offered one sacrifice for sins forever he didn't have to do a thousand or a million bulls and goats one bud one bud this man one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from now on are henceforth expecting he's sitting there expecting you to put your foot on it did somebody hang up on me from henceforth expect until his enemies be made his footstool and guess who's going to bring that into me to bring it under his feet that you come on and he's there interceding expecting a man standard error believe it expecting until all of his enemies be made his footstool well if Jesus is expecting such great thing what about you and me we are expecting [Applause] hallelujah hey mom this man sat down on the right hand of God Hebrews 2:12 12:2 looking unto Jesus take a look on the Mount he shall be seen looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith he told you to believe he'll see to fulfilling it who for the joy that was sit set before him what kind of joy was set before the joy that was set before him was you and then when he was on the cross you were on his mind he knew you yet he loves you and there he oh ma a man he what for the joy that was set before whole church you know I i sat there the other day came in the room my precious little mother-in-law she's a wonderful Christian her time is nearly up on the earth I can't ask God to give her any more time here in this wretched condition when there's joy that lays just ahead and I can't hold her here any longer and I said to the family you don't have to let her go there's a joy that she's lived for all her life like Daddy Bosworth said the one I've served all these years it's fixing to walk through these nodes so don't worry about her dining by herself she keep dying by herself no one has to cross Jordan alone so it'd be great to be there and you know to comfort her as she crosses over and say your last goodbyes but she won't cross Jordan alone and if Jesus could do it because you could endure the shame of the cross because he knew out of it all he would see his seed he would get an offspring that there would be a bride in his image he would go to it all then can't we envision just a moment just what is gonna be like when we look over and we see our loved ones start a period knowing just a minute we're gonna be changed to be like them knowing that for that joy I'll go through anything for place that there's no yesterday's or tomorrow's it's all one great big now is eternity for place is never an evil word a hurt feelings a broken home place no sin can ever enter there's a joy set before us it's worth all the shame we go through this all the heartaches we go through all the troubles we go through when they will see him it's gonna be worth it looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God Peter said it who has gold in the heavens it is on the right hand of God angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him so now where does he sit not upon a brass altar of gentlemen he has not laid as a sacrifice for two thousand years doing some kind of Arabic priesthood you know dying and suffering thousands of death his brazen altar of judgment was a cross but he sat down with the father in his throne and he was a lamb who had been slain and I'm gonna I'm gonna use here as my last scripture on this one revelation 3:21 cause it's our scripture to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame overcame and him sat down with my father in his throne so you see the way if we overcome he will grant to sit with him in the Millennial throne when he raised the son of David on the earth and will rule and reign with him for the thousand years somebody with me a man but we'll look where he is he said I am sat down with my father in his throne so he is clear even from the words of Jesus himself i sat down on the seat Abasi and it is dis altar that you come to to find Grace and help in your time of need so you can't do away with the mercy seat hey man he tells us right here in this last stage now brother Bannerman when their eyes was open 1964 if God raised up from the dead and is here tonight he promised it now his corporal body sits on the throne of God he took a set down on the throne of God but the Holy Spirit is here which is Christ in spirit form so brother Branham tells you where is he his corporal body sits on the throne of God why is this important this next quote tells you because there is no one that cares like Jesus you may tell me your name isn't Jesus help them you may ask your friend pray for hearing yes Lord you know we would remember so-and-so but there's no one cares like Jesus and you don't have to have a bishop a priest a preacher or pastor to go diseases there's no Mary that you have to go talk to there's no angel that you got to go talk to somebody help me now there's nobody there that you have to go talk to Jesus you have a free access to him he's your high priest and he knows how you feel you say well brother tell my I tell you my my mother's such pain in my body until I you know it's a little brother little brother brother wrote me last night begging from prayer and he said brother tell brother town to pray for me my joints hurt so bad I got gout in my feet I've never felt this bad will you just pray for me but I don't care what you're going through this morning and how you suffered so well brother timid spot my shoulder when he hung from that cross he knew shoulder pain say well it's my feet I can't walk the step without feeling pain he knows how that feels you say but I've got a headache than when they pounded him on his head and he wore crown of thorns and kept hitting it and sinking it down deeper and deeper he was wounded for your headache Gordon God where you could triumph all right he was bruised for your and the chastisement what the weapons you should have been taken and yeah you're the one who should suffer like that he he didn't have to suffer but he left all of glory to cut wood with the woodcutter imagine to walk calendar with the carpenters to develop to fish with the fishermen to sleep on the hard ground and to live there's a foxes have holes and birds have got nests but the Son of man don't even have a head or place to lay his head upon there's no one cares like Jesus well don't notice it got me pulled over brother Tim he knows what it is to be rocked out of pain and distorted and hurting he did that so you could be healed he didn't do that just to commiserate with you you hear me he want to set he didn't do that just to commiserate with you and say yeah I got save a I hurt worse than that you know some people some people kind of deal you know you they can't sympathize with anybody without pointing out oh yeah well my elbow mine you got to hear 15 minutes of how bad off they are and you know my elbows worse than your bow bow and so I need sympathy to God ain't wanting to give you sympathy God wants to give you healing deliverance for you to bring that thing to the cross and through the cross and say Jesus [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the other day my little grandson lay in there and this is heart beaten out of helmet and nauseated to the stomach and I had just spoke a few days before and the Lord has spoke two words to me said Beth Lee the healer is coming to your house and the other morning that enemy comes an attack and I say I'm going to take his head off the healers come in this house and I'm not the healer but Jesus is going in me because wherever I go Jesus is going the Holy Ghost is walking in a temple and overcoming right here and I took that baby in my arms and I said Jesus I'm taking drew up before your throne and the devil has done this to my son look what he's done putting him under our feet just a little bit he's down playing as if nothing happened why the healer became by he was wounded for your transgressions and we're today living beneath our privileges and we've let unbelief come over and try to put a veil between us I want you to know that veil of worry that veil of doubt is defeated before God this is my enemy and today I'm bringing him to put him under my feet because there's no one cares like Jesus knowing that his body is a high priest in a mediator work that he's doing now listen devil man that body must be in the presence of God at all times for intercession but that God cannot see the sinner sin he sees only the blood of his own son and knowing that he set back the Holy Ghost to continue to comfort his people does he care man well he gave you care he cares man if you're sick and tired of being sick and tired of being sick and tired that's already sick and tired bring it before the presence of God in a choose your future and say today is the end of my supper today is the end of the sickness hallelujah what because I have a mediator I have immediate we go down to the next one more he's sitting at the right hand of God tonight 64 sermon during his mediatorial work and when that last soul is saved that was redeemed and seen and known by God before the foundational world when that last soul is saved that closes the book and then the lamb comes out and takes the book out of the right hand of him that sets upon the throne he's coming in he's coming to the earth and until he comes to the earth it ain't over right now there's mercy great and grace is free pardon is there to be multiplied I'd like you to bow your hands I'm not calling the prayer line I'm not asking for anybody to come for prayer or even raise your hands I want you to go before the throne of grace the Bible said that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession but we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but it was in all points tempted as we are yet without sin let us come boldly into the throne of grace to that mercy seat that we might obtain mercy and find grace in the time of need I want you today not to reach out and touch me I want you to reach out and touch him does reach out and touch him as you reach out to touch him to get his attention she reached out to get his attention [Music] but not an imagination now but just in the spirit I just want you to leave your seat wherever you're at in the spirit now and now want you to go up that way that he made Jacob's Ladder that was made for angels could have sinned and he sinned I want you to go up that ladder and I want you to go right now into his presence I want you to do it that's your instructed to do it boldly without fear not Brass Li not cause you're worthy [Music] but boldly cause he told you to come that way I want you to go up there and say Jesus you see what the devil's been doing to my family my son my daughter you see what the devil's been doing to my body and you paid Redemption price for in our day you've created eyeballs and our day little woman walks up with a handkerchief over her her mouth brother branham thinks she's just crying she moves it away a big hole is there in her mouth and nose is gone just a gaping hole there where cancer hate her but just in the presence of the high priest she walks out of there and things begin to change little by little a month later or two she's in the meetings and brother branham you don't recognize me do you no ma'am I'm that woman who had no nose and there with pink skin my nose healthy mouthing you God can put high balls he can cause the mouth to be formed again the nose to

I'm going for this need right now right now amen maybe it's not for you maybe it's for a loved one maybe it's first sick husband maybe it's a condition in your body but he was wounded for our transgressions and the Hebrews are mine loot on him now iniquities and surely he bore our sorrows and by new describes our he in a service just like this the other day my wife sitting right there was she sitting felt a touch looked around to see who touch thought somebody was won by from the seed one you know kind of nuts her there to let her know she does it would pass it by and she looked and no one was there but her arm that had been painted her for months that touch it sometimes she would wince and cry of pain during the night she would moan but that day in this service the high priest
