[1:04:35] you tonight if you have your Bibles
[1:04:36] let's turn into the word of the Lord and
[1:04:38] I want to look at Revelations the 3r
[1:04:40] chapter and the 21st verse Revelation
[1:04:43] chapter 3 and verse 21 and we'll also
[1:04:47] look in Ephesians chapter 1 verse
[1:04:51] 18-22 Revelations 3 and
[1:04:57] 21 I know to you that study uh the
[1:05:00] message this is a very familiar
[1:05:02] scripture to you
[1:05:07] um to
[1:05:09] him that
[1:05:12] overcometh now brother brandham said
[1:05:14] that's individuals that's right to him
[1:05:17] that overcometh well I grant to set with
[1:05:21] me in my throne now you watch that in my
[1:05:25] Throne on not on my Throne because in
[1:05:29] Revelations the 20th chapter there's
[1:05:31] Throne set up in the Millennium and you
[1:05:33] set on a throne but here in this
[1:05:36] scripture you're sitting in a throne and
[1:05:37] brother Bram said it's you're sharing
[1:05:39] Dominion even as I also
[1:05:43] overcame and him sat down with my father
[1:05:47] in his throne now let's read Ephesians
[1:05:50] 1:
[1:05:52] 18-22 you're going to read a similar
[1:05:55] text but it's going to read just a
[1:05:57] little different the eyes of your
[1:06:00] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:06:01] may
[1:06:03] know what is the hope of his calling and
[1:06:06] what is the riches of the glory of his
[1:06:08] inheritance in the Saints so it's not
[1:06:10] just your inheritance it's his
[1:06:12] inheritance how many know the Lord's
[1:06:13] portion is his people the Lord's portion
[1:06:16] is his people and his what is the riches
[1:06:19] of Glory of his inheritance in the
[1:06:22] Saints and what is the exceeding
[1:06:24] greatness of his power to usw who
[1:06:26] believe according to the working of this
[1:06:29] Mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[1:06:32] when he raised him from the dead and set
[1:06:34] him at his own right hand in Heavenly
[1:06:37] places far above principality and power
[1:06:41] and might and dominion and every name
[1:06:43] that is named not only in this world but
[1:06:47] also and that which is to
[1:06:50] come and Heath put all things somebody
[1:06:53] say all
[1:06:54] things Heath put all things under his
[1:06:57] feet and gave him to be the head over
[1:07:00] all things to the church we ask the Lord
[1:07:04] to bless his word as you could be seated
[1:07:06] tonight I want to take for a text here
[1:07:09] and I want to I want to just speak to
[1:07:10] you a little bit tonight on overcoming
[1:07:13] at Harvest Time overcoming at Harvest
[1:07:17] Time you know uh I certainly believe
[1:07:19] we're at Harvest Time don't you amen I
[1:07:21] believe it's a time of overcoming I want
[1:07:23] to read to you from Matthew the 19th
[1:07:26] Chapter the 28th and the 30th verse and
[1:07:28] Jesus said unto them verily I say unto
[1:07:30] you that ye which have followed me in
[1:07:33] the Regeneration when the son of man
[1:07:34] shall set in the Throne of his glory you
[1:07:37] shall also set upon 12 Thrones judging
[1:07:39] the 12 tribes of Israel and everyone
[1:07:42] that have forsaken houses or Brethren or
[1:07:44] sisters or father or mother or wife or
[1:07:47] children or lands for my name's sake
[1:07:50] shall receive a h
[1:07:51] hundredfold and shall inherit
[1:07:54] Everlasting lifej isn't that amazing
[1:07:57] amen for everyone that have forsaken now
[1:07:59] just uh I just had just spoke to our
[1:08:01] church a little bit there at home on
[1:08:03] Sunday and read this spe specific
[1:08:06] scripture to them uh it was it was odd
[1:08:08] because after uh the first weekend of
[1:08:11] October uh was marking 10 years of me
[1:08:14] being in bluon Ohio with brother Ericson
[1:08:17] and the true word Tabernacle there uh
[1:08:20] that and I remember it was the first
[1:08:21] weekend of October of 2013 brother Ron
[1:08:24] Spencer was there holding meetings for
[1:08:26] the first weekend that we were there you
[1:08:28] remember that it was been a long time he
[1:08:30] asked me if I had my passport because I
[1:08:32] was coming up from Arkansas to Ohio and
[1:08:35] uh amen and uh I kind of laughed I
[1:08:38] thought well it is a different country
[1:08:39] that's for sure and uh but uh but it's
[1:08:42] been 10 years ago and then of course
[1:08:44] this in this January some of you know
[1:08:46] maybe some of you don't know but in
[1:08:48] January um brother Erikson and I had
[1:08:51] made some decisions to go ahead and and
[1:08:53] move forward with uh a transitioning to
[1:08:56] pastorship and I was voted in to be the
[1:08:58] pastor there at True Word in the middle
[1:09:00] of January of this year and uh I I do
[1:09:03] want to say that it is a great honor
[1:09:05] Amen to uh to be received in such a
[1:09:08] level and for brother Erikson to Amen to
[1:09:10] to respectfully begin to pass the Baton
[1:09:13] amen I know that uh in the message
[1:09:15] sometimes it seems like that some of the
[1:09:17] Elder Brothers uh they they just don't
[1:09:19] never give up you know as far as as
[1:09:21] pastoring and they and they just hold it
[1:09:24] and hold it and hold it and hold it and
[1:09:25] hold it and hold it and and uh but
[1:09:27] brother Erikson being a gentleman and
[1:09:30] looking at the church and saying brother
[1:09:32] Wayne and we're going to go further so
[1:09:34] we want you to step up at this time and
[1:09:36] and I tell you my hats are off and my
[1:09:38] respect to our brother Ericson and he's
[1:09:40] going to remain there with us of course
[1:09:42] as a as a senior pastor and he's a
[1:09:44] Founder so he'll be with us as long as
[1:09:47] he can he can stay with us we we trust
[1:09:49] that God will give us many years
[1:09:51] together and the strength of him and we
[1:09:53] appreciate it I'll tell you uh and and
[1:09:55] what made this amazing to me is because
[1:09:57] when I read this scripture uh this is a
[1:09:59] scripture that brother Ericson read over
[1:10:01] me 10 years ago when I moved to Ohio and
[1:10:04] um he read that he said brother Wayne he
[1:10:06] said I believe God gave me this
[1:10:08] scripture to read to you because if uh
[1:10:11] if anyone ever left all they knew I
[1:10:12] certainly did that when I moved from
[1:10:14] Arkansas to Ohio away from my family and
[1:10:16] my home and everything that I knew but
[1:10:19] God said he would restore and when I
[1:10:21] went there my kids were just young and
[1:10:23] and they were they were just young
[1:10:25] children they were uh from 10year old to
[1:10:27] 16 and it was scary uh you know what
[1:10:30] how's my kids going to react and how
[1:10:32] they going to do and how they going to
[1:10:34] root down and and you know and those
[1:10:36] things uh happen and then but 10 years
[1:10:38] ago this happened and then this last
[1:10:41] weekend marked 10 years and I was
[1:10:43] sitting there preaching to the church
[1:10:44] and and the Lord has moved me up into
[1:10:46] the into the realm of leadership and I
[1:10:48] was sitting there looking over the
[1:10:49] congregation and there sit my son
[1:10:51] Zachariah who met a beautiful beautiful
[1:10:53] girl a good Christian message girl Anna
[1:10:56] and the Lord you all know the vision the
[1:10:58] lord gave brother Ron and and the Lord
[1:11:00] blessed us with that first grand baby
[1:11:02] and eie and then along June I actually
[1:11:04] had two more grandsons Bethany had a a
[1:11:07] son and then uh an and Zach had the
[1:11:09] second son and then I looked over there
[1:11:11] and there's Isaac and Bethany and then
[1:11:13] Mariah and Brian were sitting there and
[1:11:15] the Lord's gave me uh just recently uh I
[1:11:18] don't know probably everybody knows this
[1:11:19] but just recently the Lord has called
[1:11:21] Brian into the ministry and so the Lord
[1:11:24] has given me two son-in-laws called into
[1:11:25] the ministry he's given me Zachariah in
[1:11:28] love with the Lord and serving the lord
[1:11:30] and moving in his mercy and you know and
[1:11:32] when you stand back and you look at 10
[1:11:35] years and you see that when you walked
[1:11:37] away from everything you knew but then
[1:11:39] to see the hand of God come upon it and
[1:11:42] reward it and bless it and you know uh
[1:11:45] when when things now I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:11:47] speaking to you because there's
[1:11:49] sometimes in your life when you go to
[1:11:50] looking at things and you think how is
[1:11:52] this going to work out and how's this
[1:11:54] going to be but listen if you're seeking
[1:11:57] the kingdom of God Beyond everything
[1:11:59] else any man or woman that leaves their
[1:12:02] houses and their families and their and
[1:12:04] their lives and they give everything to
[1:12:06] Jesus Christ he said I'd pay you back a
[1:12:08] h hundredfold and I am here today as a
[1:12:10] witness to you that no man has given
[1:12:13] anything to God that God does not repaid
[1:12:15] him a h hundredfold God will not be in
[1:12:18] debt to no man God will not be in debt
[1:12:20] to any woman you're never going to
[1:12:22] outgive God amen and when you give to
[1:12:24] God he gives back to you and you know
[1:12:27] God God sometimes he he brings men in
[1:12:30] your life at a certain season and I I
[1:12:32] don't know maybe I was nearly uh 40
[1:12:34] years old before brother brother Tim and
[1:12:36] I become good friends and and from that
[1:12:38] time God gave me amen great men around
[1:12:41] us and friendships and brother Ron and I
[1:12:43] become friends and the Lord has used
[1:12:45] these men greatly in my life and I and I
[1:12:48] stand here tonight to say this because
[1:12:50] amen listen God God causes changes to to
[1:12:53] come in your life he causes situations
[1:12:56] and and things happen and transitions
[1:12:59] take place and you wonder will I survive
[1:13:01] this will this will this be the thing
[1:13:03] that just finishes you or takes takes
[1:13:06] you out where you're no longer effective
[1:13:08] or you know the enemy has a way that he
[1:13:10] works with people in their minds and
[1:13:12] when you come through transitions of
[1:13:13] your life and and and I'll say this to
[1:13:16] you amen listen above all what you're
[1:13:18] going to have to learn is you don't
[1:13:20] quit is you don't give up you don't you
[1:13:23] don't get to a place in your life where
[1:13:25] you say Amen that that I can't go any
[1:13:27] further or this ain't going to be able
[1:13:29] to take because I I I'm going to tell
[1:13:31] you if you if you will overcome you're
[1:13:34] going to make it but you're going to be
[1:13:35] repaid a h hundredfold amen and can I
[1:13:38] can I say something to you real amen a a
[1:13:41] a a year is longer than a 10-minute
[1:13:43] conversation that you have or it's
[1:13:45] longer than a bad week or it's better
[1:13:48] longer than a bad month and 10 years is
[1:13:50] longer than a bad year amen but
[1:13:53] sometimes you got to realize that it
[1:13:54] takes overcoming amen we can turn around
[1:13:57] and look in 10 years and I can see all
[1:13:59] that God has did amen but there were
[1:14:01] days in those 10 years where I thought I
[1:14:04] I wasn't going to make it till tomorrow
[1:14:06] it ain't going to make it till the next
[1:14:07] week but you know the promise is if a
[1:14:10] man will overcome amen and and I say
[1:14:13] tonight sometimes what you really got to
[1:14:15] overcome is yourself you got to overcome
[1:14:18] your own feelings and your own offenses
[1:14:20] and your own ideas and your own desires
[1:14:22] to quit I don't know who you are or
[1:14:24] where you're from but I guarantee you
[1:14:26] every one of you's had a moment in your
[1:14:28] life in the last year where you've said
[1:14:30] I ain't going to be able to make it past
[1:14:32] this moment or I ain't going to be able
[1:14:33] to make it past this day amen but if you
[1:14:36] overcome there is a tomorrow and there's
[1:14:38] a next day and there's a next day and if
[1:14:41] you give it to God Amen God can take
[1:14:44] your hours and your days and your weeks
[1:14:46] and you'll turn around and look behind
[1:14:48] you and say look at the blessings of
[1:14:50] what God has done for me look at the
[1:14:53] bless listen I don't know if anybody
[1:14:54] sitting in here tonight if you're
[1:14:56] drawing breath in your lungs that
[1:14:58] shouldn't be able to worship God tonight
[1:15:00] and say thank you Lord thank you for the
[1:15:03] blessings thank you for the Holy Ghost
[1:15:05] thank you for the power of God thank you
[1:15:07] for what you've done thank you for the
[1:15:09] healings Lord thank you for the years
[1:15:11] thank you for the blessings thank you
[1:15:13] for the Miracles Lord and you know what
[1:15:16] sometimes we get so caught up in all the
[1:15:18] problems we forget what God is doing for
[1:15:21] us and if we would just begin to praise
[1:15:23] God everything else would begin to fade
[1:15:26] away and we will begin to rise up in
[1:15:28] another place in our lives there is no
[1:15:31] replace for thankfulness there is no
[1:15:33] replace for gratitude there's no
[1:15:36] replacement for it tonight when you
[1:15:38] begin to thank God from a heart and you
[1:15:40] begin to worship Him it changes a little
[1:15:42] bit of everything to you now the prophet
[1:15:44] of God tells us this he said to overcome
[1:15:48] he said is to recognize the devil in
[1:15:50] every one of his tricks a lot of people
[1:15:52] say there is no devil it's just a
[1:15:55] thought and don't don't don't you
[1:15:56] believe that there's a real devil and
[1:15:58] he's just as real as you are or
[1:16:01] anybody there's a real devil and you
[1:16:03] must recognize him real and you must
[1:16:05] know he's a devil and at the same time
[1:16:08] you've got to recognize him and know
[1:16:11] he's a devil and he's against you then
[1:16:13] to overcome you've got to recognize that
[1:16:16] God is in you and is greater and
[1:16:18] mightier than he is and the one that's
[1:16:20] in you has already overcome and by his
[1:16:23] grace you are more than a match for him
[1:16:26] that's real overcoming is
[1:16:29] recognizing is recognizing that urge to
[1:16:32] quit is the devil is recognizing that
[1:16:35] desire to give up is the devil to
[1:16:37] recognize that spirit that speaks to you
[1:16:40] and says you're not enough you can't
[1:16:42] make it you can't do it you ain't going
[1:16:44] to get over it that's the devil trying
[1:16:46] to hold you from the blessings that God
[1:16:48] has gave you and I just sometimes want
[1:16:50] to stop and think about this if the
[1:16:52] devil is working this hard to stop you
[1:16:55] then what must God have ahead of you
[1:16:58] that Satan is afraid of I tell you what
[1:17:01] you are Satan's worst nightmare the
[1:17:03] worst nightmare that Satan has is a
[1:17:06] child of God that won't give up that
[1:17:08] won't turn around that won't get
[1:17:09] discouraged that won't get offended come
[1:17:11] on church amen amen I got some Elder
[1:17:14] Christians in here tonight that's got
[1:17:16] their families they've got their
[1:17:17] grandkids they've got their kids kids
[1:17:20] amen and you know why they got that is
[1:17:22] because they never got offended and they
[1:17:24] never quit and they never gave up and
[1:17:27] they believed God Amen and if God did it
[1:17:29] for them I believe he'll do it for you I
[1:17:32] believe God can do things for people if
[1:17:35] they'll just hold on to
[1:17:38] God yes sir I believe it I believe we
[1:17:41] got to overcome
[1:17:43] ourselves I believe sometimes we got to
[1:17:45] overcome ourselves you don't hear where
[1:17:48] we are in the age we're living in the
[1:17:51] prophet of God tells us that we're like
[1:17:52] it was on Mount transfigurations he says
[1:17:55] that when Jesus was standing there he
[1:17:57] said that's when the prophets and
[1:17:59] everything else was finished there on
[1:18:01] that mountain that's where the law of
[1:18:03] Moses and the Prophet Elijah came and
[1:18:06] the law and Prophets begin to come to an
[1:18:08] end now a lot of people takes that and
[1:18:10] they go into error with it but but the
[1:18:12] Bible tells us that after John the law
[1:18:14] and the prophets ended but look at the
[1:18:16] next verse it said but after that the
[1:18:19] kingdom of God but after that the
[1:18:22] kingdom of God what is that speaking of
[1:18:24] brother random says in Hebrews chapter 1
[1:18:26] in the last days he'll speak through his
[1:18:28] son brother ROM said that's prophecy
[1:18:31] that God would possess his own church
[1:18:33] that it wouldn't be a prophet it would
[1:18:35] be Jesus Christ the prophet of prophets
[1:18:39] that would come down and to live in the
[1:18:41] church that's why the the testimony of
[1:18:43] the Bride is the spirit of Prophecy in
[1:18:46] the last days because Jesus himself is
[1:18:49] living in bright form do you see this is
[1:18:52] the hour when the scripture says hear ye
[1:18:55] him now if he said hear ye him in the
[1:18:58] Bible that was a prophecy he would speak
[1:19:00] in the last days now today if God's
[1:19:03] going to speak he's got to have a voice
[1:19:05] amen and the prophet identified the
[1:19:08] voice and he said it's not the church he
[1:19:10] said the bride is the final voice of the
[1:19:13] final hour what is she she's the
[1:19:15] speaking blood is that right then when
[1:19:18] your life is being lived amen it's a
[1:19:20] living voice and if that voice is the
[1:19:23] voice of the blood of Christ it is deity
[1:19:26] that's speaking out of you amen it's not
[1:19:28] just your heritage it's not just your
[1:19:30] genology it is deity that is living in
[1:19:33] you and this is to happen in my Bible it
[1:19:36] says in the days when the son of man is
[1:19:39] being revealed I believe we're standing
[1:19:41] here tonight in the history of the
[1:19:43] opening of The Seven Seals we're not
[1:19:45] waiting for a prophet tonight to come
[1:19:47] and open the seals we're not waiting for
[1:19:49] a prophet to return and set up a tent
[1:19:51] and have a Tent Revival and restore the
[1:19:53] church amen the church has the message
[1:19:56] of restoration we have the Harvest we
[1:19:59] have the word we have the mind of Christ
[1:20:02] in this age amen it's written in the
[1:20:05] Bible in Joel chapter 2 I will restore
[1:20:07] to you the years that the Locust have
[1:20:10] eaten and the cankerworm and the
[1:20:11] caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great
[1:20:13] Army which i s among you and you shall
[1:20:16] eat plenty and be satisfied praise the
[1:20:19] name of the Lord your God he had dealt
[1:20:21] wondrously with you you and my people
[1:20:24] shall never be ashamed you see what he's
[1:20:26] predicting is a harvest in the time of
[1:20:28] restoration he's talking about the the
[1:20:30] wheat of the word that would return to
[1:20:33] the church that we wouldn't be living in
[1:20:35] a Husk age or a stock age or a tassel
[1:20:38] age it would be when the wheat returns
[1:20:40] to wheat it would be when the original
[1:20:42] gospel is being preached again in its
[1:20:44] power well that's exactly when the Devil
[1:20:47] comes like a flood that's exactly when
[1:20:49] Satan runs in like he's never ran in
[1:20:51] before that was in the Harvest when
[1:20:53] shangar had to protect his family and
[1:20:56] his Harvest with a noox nod brother man
[1:20:59] said he was only a farmer he wasn't a
[1:21:01] military man but he was going to keep
[1:21:03] his Harvest and I believe the Church of
[1:21:05] the Living God has been given a message
[1:21:08] in this hour and if you're going to keep
[1:21:10] the Harvest of this word you're going to
[1:21:12] have to fight with whatever you can get
[1:21:14] your hands
[1:21:16] on I believe my Bible said that
[1:21:19] everything would be restored to this
[1:21:21] church we will be back to the original
[1:21:24] book of Acts we will be restored back to
[1:21:26] the original Pentecost but see not just
[1:21:29] the original Pentecost but the original
[1:21:32] Pentecost and it would take us all the
[1:21:33] way back to what the Garden of Eden
[1:21:36] possessed for the church we would
[1:21:38] restore our right to the tree of life it
[1:21:40] would restore our inheritance with God
[1:21:43] it would restore our sunship back as if
[1:21:46] we had never fail in the beginning amen
[1:21:48] we're talking about a people that is
[1:21:50] going all the way back in the mind of
[1:21:52] God now listen folks the mind of God has
[1:21:55] been delivered to us in this age by a
[1:21:58] prophet of God Amen it's what was being
[1:22:01] opened under the Seven Seals it was not
[1:22:03] the flesh Mind of a man it was the mind
[1:22:05] of God that was coming to the church
[1:22:07] then what we have to see tonight is that
[1:22:10] the message has been delivered the
[1:22:12] spirit of God has already been given to
[1:22:14] the church restoration and harvest has
[1:22:17] already been restored to the church you
[1:22:19] said preacher what do we need tonight
[1:22:21] Paul said we need our eyes opened we
[1:22:24] need eyes sa that we might be able to
[1:22:27] see you know sometimes it's just our
[1:22:30] seeing that needs
[1:22:32] changed you know Luke 24 Jesus walked
[1:22:35] with two on the road to amus when he
[1:22:37] went down to the evening time and he
[1:22:39] went into the end with them isn't it
[1:22:41] amazing he had already been resurrected
[1:22:44] he had already been to the father and
[1:22:45] paid the debt he all in debt had already
[1:22:48] been paid he was already in an immortal
[1:22:51] body he was already walk walking with
[1:22:53] them but they didn't know who that was
[1:22:56] among them but when their eyes were
[1:22:58] opened amen they saw what had already
[1:23:01] been done listen tonight folks amen the
[1:23:04] son of man has already been revealed
[1:23:07] Among Us amen the word has been opened
[1:23:09] up restoration has come to the church
[1:23:12] adoption has been poured out upon the
[1:23:14] Church of the Living God and if the eyes
[1:23:17] could come open tonight every which
[1:23:19] direction you could see you would
[1:23:21] realize it belongs to you
[1:23:23] it belongs to you if you can get out of
[1:23:25] the husk tonight you can see it's your
[1:23:27] promise it's your promise it's your
[1:23:29] promise it's your promise amen I'm in
[1:23:31] the Bible when Abraham come out into his
[1:23:34] land and he had his father and he had
[1:23:36] his uncle with him remember when he met
[1:23:38] mdct was right after he departed from
[1:23:41] them and mdct says to him lift up your
[1:23:44] eyes lift up your eyes now that you have
[1:23:47] separated and you can believe everything
[1:23:50] I said lift up your eyes and look to to
[1:23:52] the north and look to the East and look
[1:23:54] to the South and look to the west and it
[1:23:57] all belongs to
[1:24:00] you listen every promise in this book
[1:24:02] belongs to you if you get out from under
[1:24:05] denominational and traditional ideas
[1:24:08] every promise in this book belongs to
[1:24:11] the Church of the Living God and if we
[1:24:13] got to fight with an ox nood brother
[1:24:15] pick up the ox if we got to fight with
[1:24:18] the word pick up the word because it
[1:24:20] belongs to us
[1:24:25] for our children for our children's
[1:24:27] children for our churches for our people
[1:24:30] oh we must hold on to this word of life
[1:24:34] that's been sin into this
[1:24:37] age in Ephesians chapter 1 it said if
[1:24:39] our eyes were opened up that we could
[1:24:42] share the throne with
[1:24:44] him then we would see as I have
[1:24:48] overcame and sat down on my father's
[1:24:51] throne so will you share in my Throne if
[1:24:54] you
[1:24:56] overcome now overcoming means to stand
[1:24:58] the
[1:25:00] test isn't that powerful I was sitting
[1:25:02] in the hospital the other day and my my
[1:25:04] dad had just had a a mild stroke and we
[1:25:07] were sitting there with him for maybe a
[1:25:08] couple weeks in the hospital and I was
[1:25:10] just sitting there one day and I was
[1:25:11] just in my own world thinking about the
[1:25:13] scripture and and the spirit of the Lord
[1:25:15] spoke to me and he said and the tempter
[1:25:18] came and that just that little phrase
[1:25:21] caught me and the tempter came I said
[1:25:24] where's that at in the scripture and I
[1:25:26] ran over and started looking y'all know
[1:25:28] where that's at in the scripture it's
[1:25:30] when Jesus receives the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:32] when he goes into the Wilderness the
[1:25:35] Bible said and the tempter came do you
[1:25:37] know do you know that's when the tempter
[1:25:40] comes now now it's amazing is God our
[1:25:44] lord Jesus was God he was God in heaven
[1:25:48] who had a glory before the world began
[1:25:50] and he took on a human robe and he left
[1:25:53] all of his glory in heaven and he took
[1:25:56] on a humble human robe and came down to
[1:25:59] the Earth and he weakened himself to
[1:26:01] humanity Bible said come lower than the
[1:26:04] angels and took upon him the Seed of
[1:26:06] Abraham that he might be
[1:26:09] tempted tested in every manner like an
[1:26:12] unto us is that right so he wasn't
[1:26:15] tested as deity he was tested as a man
[1:26:18] but then he starved that body until body
[1:26:22] got so weak into 40 days of
[1:26:25] hunger that's when the tempter
[1:26:28] came when he was in the weakest weakest
[1:26:31] moment now you all you all could study
[1:26:33] the famines of the world you can study
[1:26:35] the history of the world and know that
[1:26:36] hunger is one of the greatest pools on a
[1:26:38] human being that people will do more for
[1:26:41] food than they will for anything else in
[1:26:43] the Bible it's recorded women ate one
[1:26:45] another's
[1:26:46] babies but when they got hungry enough
[1:26:49] they fed their children to one another
[1:26:52] come on now we're talking about serious
[1:26:54] hunger we're talking about people that
[1:26:56] had wrecks with their friends in the
[1:26:57] airplanes amen and ate one another
[1:27:00] because they got so hungry they turned
[1:27:02] into cannibals because a human pull for
[1:27:05] Hunger gets beyond what a man could
[1:27:08] possibly withstand when he gets into
[1:27:10] that place and the Bible said and when
[1:27:12] the tempter came he said to him cast
[1:27:15] these down and make these stones into
[1:27:17] bread and tempted him on the word of God
[1:27:19] remember what Jesus did he said but it's
[1:27:23] written man shall not live by bread
[1:27:25] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:27:27] out of the mouth of God remember then
[1:27:29] the devil come at him another way and
[1:27:31] tempted him to show off with this gift
[1:27:34] and then the devil tempted him another
[1:27:35] way and said I'll give you the kingdoms
[1:27:37] of this world Amen and you won't have to
[1:27:40] do anything for it you don't have to be
[1:27:42] crucified for it you don't have to be
[1:27:44] rejected for it you don't have to be
[1:27:45] thrown down for it if you'll just kneel
[1:27:48] down to me I'll give you the kingdoms of
[1:27:51] the world world isn't that amazing that
[1:27:54] the tempter offered a man brother man
[1:27:57] said it wasn't the kingdom in that day
[1:27:59] it was the kingdom in this day it was
[1:28:01] the kingdom in all of his glory when
[1:28:03] Satan had his Eden to the top in his
[1:28:05] climax that's what he showed Jesus but
[1:28:08] Jesus refused that in the great
[1:28:12] Temptation and he
[1:28:14] overcame and the Bible is telling us
[1:28:17] that you can overcome also look at what
[1:28:19] it was when brother Brandon was losing
[1:28:21] his wife and his daughter he said that's
[1:28:23] when the tempter came remember what he
[1:28:26] done he got him in that weak moment and
[1:28:27] as the tempter came to him he began to
[1:28:29] say brother Bram said at one place he
[1:28:31] said God wouldn't talk to me but Jackie
[1:28:33] said God wouldn't talk to me he said
[1:28:35] that's when the devil did he said when
[1:28:37] God wouldn't answer my prayer that's
[1:28:39] when the devil come to me and he said
[1:28:41] look all you've ever done is pray for
[1:28:43] God's children preach the gospel give
[1:28:45] your life he said and when you need
[1:28:48] him and brother Ram said I said I come
[1:28:51] into my mind to say that's right he said
[1:28:54] I was about to say well if he can't help
[1:28:55] me then I can't and he said listen now
[1:28:58] all human reason to serve God was gone
[1:29:01] from me all the human reason that I man
[1:29:05] would serve God was gone he said but sit
[1:29:07] down and my soul was a birth and he said
[1:29:10] out of that Birth come the words amen
[1:29:13] the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[1:29:16] blessed be the name of the Lord he said
[1:29:19] and the pressure left me Hallelujah
[1:29:22] the pressure left me when the word
[1:29:24] answered the test the pressure left me
[1:29:27] and it put brother brandom in a place it
[1:29:29] put him in a position he put him in an
[1:29:32] authority that even in his passion years
[1:29:35] later a cross-eyed child would walk on
[1:29:37] the platform and he could look at them
[1:29:39] and make their eyes straighten up
[1:29:41] because he was sharing a Dominion
[1:29:43] because that he had overcome by the word
[1:29:46] do you recognize tonight amen that
[1:29:48] you're that you got things you got to
[1:29:50] overcome
[1:29:53] hjuj come on Church the devil's not
[1:29:55] coming at you when you're on your high
[1:29:57] pot he's not coming when you're on the
[1:29:59] top of the mountain but Satan waits till
[1:30:01] you get real low he waits till the sick
[1:30:04] die he waits till the trouble comes he
[1:30:06] waits till the failures happen in the
[1:30:08] family he waits till a little mixup gets
[1:30:10] in the church and then he comes and then
[1:30:13] he attacks you but I say to him that
[1:30:15] overcometh to him that'll stand with a
[1:30:18] word in the middle of the trial in the
[1:30:21] middle of the problem I say the Bible is
[1:30:24] telling us they will rule with
[1:30:26] him they will share in a dominion over
[1:30:30] Satan because they're able to hold on to
[1:30:32] that word listen this bride has the mind
[1:30:36] of
[1:30:37] christl and the prophet said nothing
[1:30:40] would persuade them
[1:30:42] different I love that don't you nothing
[1:30:45] would persuade them different they had
[1:30:48] the mind of Christ now what they've done
[1:30:50] is they've traded the finite for the
[1:30:54] infinite they think about trials
[1:30:56] differently than humans
[1:30:59] do humans think about a trial what' you
[1:31:02] do
[1:31:04] wrong humans think about a trial God
[1:31:06] must be punishing you for something but
[1:31:09] the infinite mind comes upon the finite
[1:31:12] and says God has a plan in this all
[1:31:14] things work together for the good of
[1:31:15] them that love God and are called
[1:31:17] according to his purpose God will get
[1:31:19] Glory out of this amen the Bible said if
[1:31:21] God before you who can be against you
[1:31:24] listen the devil's got to come that's
[1:31:26] his job but it's our job to cast him out
[1:31:29] to turn him around to take this word of
[1:31:32] life and hold our
[1:31:37] Harvest now you'll trade the finite for
[1:31:40] the infinite I don't have time to preach
[1:31:42] on that but I'll say this amen that's
[1:31:45] exactly what Rebecca did when she veiled
[1:31:47] herself in the field to meet Isaac
[1:31:50] brother Ram said when she put that Veil
[1:31:52] he said she didn't want any of her
[1:31:53] thoughts when she approached her husband
[1:31:56] he said from that time on Isaac was her
[1:31:58] thinking and here this bride has met
[1:32:01] this word and we veiled ourselves from
[1:32:04] our own thinking from our own decisions
[1:32:06] from our own per come on some of you
[1:32:08] left houses and homes some of you amen
[1:32:11] come out of Every Which situation and
[1:32:13] you gave up and forsook everything and
[1:32:15] maybe you're standing there in the
[1:32:16] middle of a trial saying God I've gave
[1:32:19] up everything and look where I'm at
[1:32:20] tonight let be assure you friend God has
[1:32:23] not forgotten your labor of love amen
[1:32:26] the Bible said any man that would give
[1:32:28] up I will restore to him H
[1:32:32] hundredfold yes sir I say he's here
[1:32:34] tonight I say the Creator's here tonight
[1:32:37] and if you could hold into the
[1:32:38] revelation of the word there's a power
[1:32:40] to push the enemy back to bring the life
[1:32:44] amen to restore that back to you now
[1:32:48] what will Revelation do for you
[1:32:50] revelation will trade
[1:32:52] the finite for the infinite other words
[1:32:54] to transfer the mind of God to the human
[1:32:59] it takes Revelation now if you want to
[1:33:01] transfer uh uh uh book knowledge to you
[1:33:03] you read a book but if you want to
[1:33:06] transfer Dynamic power you get
[1:33:09] Revelation Revelation is not an
[1:33:11] intellectual Affair Revelation is a
[1:33:13] spiritual Affair it has to spiritually
[1:33:16] Transform You by a transferring power of
[1:33:20] the spirit of God quickens his word and
[1:33:22] makes it live inside you it brings you
[1:33:26] Dynamic power not just knowledge but
[1:33:30] Dynamic power now do you see even the
[1:33:33] Rapture is a
[1:33:37] revelation even the Rapture is a
[1:33:39] revelation now you can't have Revelation
[1:33:42] without it being faith and faith is a
[1:33:46] revelation faith is a revelation how now
[1:33:50] the prophet will tell us this and
[1:33:51] another one's the end time he'll say now
[1:33:53] watch that first poll is a healing that
[1:33:56] second poll is a prophecy but that third
[1:33:59] pull is the opening of the word it's the
[1:34:02] mystery revealed and there's no more
[1:34:04] higher order to reveal the word than a
[1:34:07] prophet and the only way a prophet can
[1:34:09] be Vindicated is by that word and
[1:34:12] remember the third pull was the opening
[1:34:14] of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden
[1:34:18] truth that's been sealed in that word
[1:34:21] see the mind of Christ was sealed away
[1:34:24] from the church but when that message
[1:34:26] was opened up it opened the mind to the
[1:34:30] church now it's not a pull pit Affair
[1:34:33] it's not a pull pit Affair this not just
[1:34:35] an anointed man and a bunch of people
[1:34:37] trying to absorb some intellectual
[1:34:40] speech but this is a relationship Affair
[1:34:43] where the church has been taken back
[1:34:45] into the back part of God's mind hid
[1:34:48] away from the world transferred into the
[1:34:50] presence of God God by the power of the
[1:34:52] Revelation and in there is where every
[1:34:55] believer whether she's a whether she's a
[1:34:57] widow woman or whether she's a washwoman
[1:34:59] whether she's a simpler amen whether
[1:35:01] he's a great man it's not a pull pit
[1:35:04] anointing it's a broad
[1:35:06] anointing hallelujah amen it's to a
[1:35:09] place where if you can every person
[1:35:11] could catch the Revelation every man
[1:35:14] that cometh unto God could receive the
[1:35:17] revelation of this age and you don't
[1:35:19] have to be a preacher or a special
[1:35:21] person you got to be a believer you got
[1:35:23] to be an overcomer if you can overcome
[1:35:26] will I share with you the Revelation
[1:35:29] that brings you into Power Hallelujah
[1:35:32] now listen I I believe tonight that God
[1:35:35] has a way of inducting the church into
[1:35:37] Power it's Revelation the importance of
[1:35:40] Revelation by the spirit to a True
[1:35:42] Believer can never be
[1:35:45] overemphasized come on y'all know these
[1:35:47] quotes and now you got to be real
[1:35:49] careful cuz these are not intellectual
[1:35:53] got to be real careful cuz the letter
[1:35:56] kills the spirit gives
[1:35:59] life the importance of the Revelation is
[1:36:02] the True Believer can never be
[1:36:04] overemphasized Revelation means more
[1:36:06] than perhaps you can understand because
[1:36:09] what happens is revelation is what
[1:36:12] contacts the
[1:36:14] soul now you got to you got to see
[1:36:16] something powerful is that you are a
[1:36:19] Triune being right you got a body you
[1:36:22] got a spirit you got a soul do you know
[1:36:25] that your body could be eat up with
[1:36:26] cancer and your soul a
[1:36:29] Christian do you know that you can have
[1:36:31] your spirit Afflicted with oppressions
[1:36:34] and nervousness and all kinds of
[1:36:36] anxieties and you're 100% a Christian
[1:36:39] because inside the soul is whether a man
[1:36:43] is saved or a man is unsaved and this
[1:36:46] outward body can take attacks from every
[1:36:49] which direction it can take attacks in
[1:36:51] the human body it can take attx in the
[1:36:53] spirit body but see there's a soul of a
[1:36:56] man if that Soul ever comes in contact
[1:36:59] with God that is a gene that come from
[1:37:02] before the foundation of the world that
[1:37:05] Gene seed of God cannot be changed can I
[1:37:09] say it to you like this the devil can't
[1:37:10] change what God done in eternity I don't
[1:37:14] care how sick the body gets I don't care
[1:37:17] how nervous the spirit gets as a soul on
[1:37:20] the inside of the believer that the
[1:37:22] devil can't touch that because it
[1:37:24] belongs to
[1:37:26] God I'll say this to you you can take a
[1:37:28] drop of water and drop it into a top
[1:37:31] drop it into a a little a little cup of
[1:37:33] wine and you ever get that water out of
[1:37:35] that wine you'll never do it because it
[1:37:38] becomes one with it and when the
[1:37:41] spiritual Revelation is given to a
[1:37:43] Believer no amount of tribulation will
[1:37:46] get that Revelation out of them you can
[1:37:48] beat them you can destroy them you can
[1:37:50] you can can hammer on them but there's
[1:37:52] something in them come on church I know
[1:37:55] what I'm talking about I'm s looking at
[1:37:57] brother Jackie tonight here with his
[1:37:58] walker amen but I tell you what the
[1:38:01] body's taking a eaten amen but the Soul
[1:38:04] on the inside of that man says I have
[1:38:09] overcome still holding the battle still
[1:38:12] believing the word why because there's
[1:38:15] an overcomer in
[1:38:17] there
[1:38:19] hallelujah hallelujah I don't I God
[1:38:21] bless you all I don't mean to make an
[1:38:23] example of you my bet he gets probably
[1:38:25] gets tired of it but brother Amen
[1:38:27] brother Ron's probably the best example
[1:38:28] I can give you in this building
[1:38:31] tonight I know I know the devil says
[1:38:34] well this is going to happen this going
[1:38:35] to happen but the devil's a liar
[1:38:37] right amen but somebody's got to hold
[1:38:41] and overcome no matter what their body's
[1:38:43] going
[1:38:44] through the word is still the
[1:38:48] word you said it's easy for brother on
[1:38:51] that's in his physical what about you
[1:38:53] that's holding that n that nervousness
[1:38:55] that anxiety and you're walking around
[1:38:58] thinking well I've sinned or I've done
[1:38:59] this or I've done that it's no different
[1:39:01] than some kind of sickness on your body
[1:39:04] and the devil's trying to do all he can
[1:39:05] do to tell you he has a right to be
[1:39:08] there but that's a lie he has no right
[1:39:10] to be there and as a Son of God I got a
[1:39:13] right to charge him tonight by the power
[1:39:16] of God and say Satan I rebuke you you're
[1:39:20] trespassing God's Property you have no
[1:39:23] right to be there you have no hold to be
[1:39:26] there amen I tell you what I tell you
[1:39:28] this if he wants to hook up to this
[1:39:30] spirit I tell him he better hold on
[1:39:32] brother cuz he's pring to get a ride of
[1:39:34] his life this is going to be a tongue
[1:39:36] talking Holy Ghost feel sound believer
[1:39:39] if he's going to hold on to my spirit
[1:39:41] he's going to have to hear the Praises
[1:39:43] and the
[1:39:45] testimonies I'll tell you what I think
[1:39:48] sometimes we are to pull the devil up a
[1:39:50] chair if you you want to come to church
[1:39:52] we'll come to church but you're going to
[1:39:54] come to watch me
[1:40:06] Rejoice oh
[1:40:09] Hallelujah somebody say hallelujah
[1:40:17] hallelujah you know the Gates of Hell
[1:40:19] will never Prevail against this
[1:40:24] the Gates of Hell will never Prevail
[1:40:27] against spiritual
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:30] Revelation never do it the Gates of Hell
[1:40:33] will never against the Revelation the
[1:40:36] Gates of Hell will never Prevail that
[1:40:37] means they'll be after it but it will
[1:40:40] never Prevail over it it is revelation
[1:40:42] of God that gives you authority over the
[1:40:46] devil direct quotes it is a revelation
[1:40:49] that will give you a fire over the
[1:40:52] devil and the devil's been telling you
[1:40:55] he has authority over
[1:40:57] you but if you let the infinite transfer
[1:41:01] to the finite you would find out in the
[1:41:04] mind of God you've already been
[1:41:08] glorified in Romans the 8th chapter say
[1:41:11] many as he's called he's Justified and
[1:41:12] as many he's Justified he's already
[1:41:14] glorified and if you can overcome and
[1:41:16] get your eyes open you would find out
[1:41:19] that you are belonging to God and have
[1:41:22] authority over this
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:25] devil it'll take the open of them
[1:41:27] themselves to do it thank God they're
[1:41:30] open Revelations 1 and6 you can see it
[1:41:32] change in scripture I love how
[1:41:34] scriptures are just written so beautiful
[1:41:36] yeah in Revelations 1:6 he said he's
[1:41:38] made us Kings and Priests y'all know
[1:41:40] what that means the highest of the civil
[1:41:43] and the highest of the
[1:41:45] religious Kings and Priests unto our God
[1:41:49] to be him be glory and Dominion forever
[1:41:51] now watch what we're Kings and Priests
[1:41:53] but to him be dominion and Glory before
[1:41:55] the seals when the seals open in
[1:41:58] Revelation chapter 5 and the 10th verse
[1:41:59] John changes his language and he said
[1:42:02] has made us unto our God Kings and
[1:42:03] Priests and we shall reign on the earth
[1:42:08] look it went from Jesus having Dominion
[1:42:10] to we're going to have dominion what
[1:42:12] happened the man saw his name in that
[1:42:15] book he understood that the blood had
[1:42:18] spoke for him and every sin and every
[1:42:21] disbelief and every trial had been put
[1:42:23] under the blood and he knew if you could
[1:42:25] just get rid of the sin that man was
[1:42:28] made to be over the
[1:42:30] [Music]
[1:42:30] [Applause]
[1:42:34] Angels we're going to be Kings with him
[1:42:36] we sit on the earth and throne but right
[1:42:39] now we are spiritual Kings I know you
[1:42:40] know this scripture it's beautiful
[1:42:42] Romans 5:17 tells us this that we would
[1:42:45] reign in this life in Colossians 1:3 it
[1:42:48] tells us that we have been
[1:42:49] delivered from the power of darkness and
[1:42:52] translated into the kingdom reign of his

[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:43:42] now isn't it amazing to realize right
[1:43:46] now that you've been seated can I can I
[1:43:48] can I tell you this I'll tell you how
[1:43:50] brother Bram said it we're in the
[1:43:51] wheelbarrow come on yeah in other words
[1:43:54] it's easy for us to sit and say Jesus is
[1:43:56] seated come in power brother brandom
[1:43:59] seated in power but brother brandom
[1:44:02] explains it humble thyself in a very
[1:44:04] beautiful way what he says is he says
[1:44:06] look he said now the other day he said a
[1:44:08] man come and his Pastor was telling him
[1:44:09] a story and he said he said I can take
[1:44:11] this wheelbarrow and I can push it
[1:44:13] across this gap on this log and he said
[1:44:15] the man said to the pastor he said I
[1:44:17] believe you can he said the man come
[1:44:20] back and I'll shorten the story man come
[1:44:22] back and he said I believe I can push
[1:44:23] this wheel bear across here with you in
[1:44:26] it took a different Faith didn't it it's
[1:44:30] one thing to see a prophet doing
[1:44:32] something pushing a wheelbarrow but with
[1:44:35] you in
[1:44:36] it now it's a different kind of
[1:44:39] Faith because what you're seeing then is
[1:44:41] you're a part of the administration of
[1:44:43] what is happening in this age he put you
[1:44:47] in the
[1:44:49] willbur now can can I just say it hey
[1:44:51] man since we're since we're just old
[1:44:53] Hill belly folk we'll say it I got a
[1:44:55] wheelbarrow and a
[1:44:58] PhD postto
[1:45:03] diggers man I get deep with those things
[1:45:06] [Applause]
[1:45:10] too anybody got a PhD in
[1:45:13] here you see amen you if if you see it
[1:45:16] if you understand it you're in the
[1:45:18] wheelbarrow with him don't get out of
[1:45:21] the
[1:45:22] WHEB don't disposition yourself because
[1:45:26] the pressure the enemy is going to put
[1:45:28] on you the devil's going to do
[1:45:29] everything he can do to get you out of
[1:45:30] that wheelbarrow he's going to make fun
[1:45:32] of you he's going to tease you put
[1:45:34] pressure on you he'll say well you're a
[1:45:35] failure you're trying to make something
[1:45:37] of yourself you're trying to be amen but
[1:45:39] you know sometimes false humility is the
[1:45:41] worst problem we
[1:45:44] have yeah we might as well go ahead and
[1:45:46] preach since we come all the way down
[1:45:47] here well I can't sing
[1:45:51] now if you can't sing where's that put
[1:45:56] me well I tell you I can't preach well
[1:45:59] if you can't preach sit
[1:46:04] down but if God called you take the
[1:46:07] position and tell the devil to get out
[1:46:09] of the
[1:46:10] way I might not be the best preacher but
[1:46:13] God called me he called me and brother
[1:46:17] if God called me he'll back me up and I
[1:46:21] don't need a bunch of good words I need
[1:46:23] the power of God to drop into the church
[1:46:27] and anoint the hearts of the Believers
[1:46:29] that's what we need is Men Of God that
[1:46:32] know God called them men of God that are
[1:46:34] sure of where they're standing and why
[1:46:37] they're standing
[1:46:38] there I'm not here because a man put me
[1:46:41] here I'm here because God put me
[1:46:43] [Applause]
[1:46:45] here and if God give you the seat it's
[1:46:48] your
[1:46:49] seat
[1:46:52] come on church it's the
[1:46:55] truth now we're in the WHEB I believe
[1:46:58] right now we are sons of God you know
[1:47:00] I'm in the scripture 1 John chapter 3 or
[1:47:02] we are right now
[1:47:05] sons and brother B says see he says but
[1:47:08] if he says listen now he said if you can
[1:47:11] ever get the scare out of the church and
[1:47:12] let them realize who they are what they
[1:47:14] are
[1:47:15] positionally healing will be the
[1:47:17] simplest message to be preached or
[1:47:20] anything else but you're scared you're
[1:47:24] afraid you don't realize that you're
[1:47:26] Sons and Daughters of God now not you
[1:47:29] will be you are right now Sons and
[1:47:32] Daughters of God not off in the future
[1:47:35] somewhere right now you said brother
[1:47:38] Wayne this issue and this issue but the
[1:47:40] tempter came to him and his first words
[1:47:45] if thou be the Son of God he never said
[1:47:48] there wasn't a son of God he never
[1:47:50] scripturally said there wasn't coming a
[1:47:52] Son of God he just said if thou be he
[1:47:55] put a question mark over if you're the
[1:47:58] one and that's the thing the devil's too
[1:48:00] smart to say there's not a reality he's
[1:48:02] too smart to say there's not a real
[1:48:04] church or there's a real bride or
[1:48:06] there's a real Rapture he just says if
[1:48:08] there'll be well let me tell you this
[1:48:11] amen it's not because I made myself amen
[1:48:14] but a prophet came in this age and he
[1:48:16] identified this bride not as a church as
[1:48:19] the bride that was in the mind of Christ
[1:48:22] before the foundation of the world and
[1:48:24] tonight we are seated in Heavenly places
[1:48:27] by the message of the
[1:48:31] hour I know what it's like people say
[1:48:33] well brother Wayne someday there's a
[1:48:35] great Revival
[1:48:36] coming and I really like how they do it
[1:48:39] and they all look back to that great
[1:48:41] Revival that
[1:48:42] was well I'm sorry but I'm interested in
[1:48:45] the one that's

[1:49:44] people right now this very
[1:49:47] minute what the prophet said amen he
[1:49:50] said right now I like that present
[1:49:55] tense right now right now do you know
[1:49:59] you know the prophet teaches us things
[1:50:01] of how to perform
[1:50:03] miracles do you know there's people
[1:50:05] don't even believe in
[1:50:08] miracles days of Miracles has
[1:50:11] passed isn't that amazing that we've
[1:50:14] come so far we've went back to Church of
[1:50:16] Christ
[1:50:19] teaching
[1:50:20] come on I'm not I'm not got to be
[1:50:23] straight with you I know what I'm
[1:50:24] talking about I've been the guy that
[1:50:26] preached on Miracles and other people
[1:50:27] come and say well that stuff was proved
[1:50:29] and brother brandom we don't need it
[1:50:30] proved anymore we just believe the word
[1:50:32] funny thing is there was a Church of
[1:50:34] Christ preacher told me the same thing
[1:50:35] about
[1:50:37] Paul Paul proved it now we got the word
[1:50:39] that's all we have to do is believe well
[1:50:41] I don't want any word that don't work
[1:50:43] today if that word ain't as good today
[1:50:46] as it was yesterday what good is it
[1:50:49] doing our children when our children are
[1:50:51] laying with addictions and troubles and
[1:50:54] problems we need a God that can come on
[1:50:56] the scene we need a God that can walk in
[1:50:59] a building and change lives and hearts
[1:51:02] and move people together that's the kind
[1:51:04] of God we need we don't need a God
[1:51:06] that'll show up next week or next month
[1:51:08] or next
[1:51:08] [Applause]
[1:51:13] year we need preachers and teachers that
[1:51:16] could call it present tense and you're
[1:51:18] never going to do it from your human El
[1:51:20] CU your human element was going to fail
[1:51:23] you but brother random taught us how to
[1:51:25] perform a
[1:51:27] miracle he literally taught us how you
[1:51:30] say how do we perform Miracles brother
[1:51:31] bam said this is how they're performed
[1:51:33] he said you believe God's
[1:51:36] word he says take God at his word and
[1:51:39] begin to believe it that's the only way
[1:51:41] to please him take his word that's the
[1:51:43] way Miracles are performed when God took
[1:51:47] his word the impossibilities Are Made
[1:51:49] Real when God has tooken his word and
[1:51:52] not questioned get it out of your
[1:51:55] mind this day this scripture is
[1:51:58] fulfilled that's the only thing in your
[1:52:00] mind refuse to see anything that
[1:52:02] disagrees with that word come on Church
[1:52:05] we've got living proof here tonight amen
[1:52:07] that God is able to defy the human body
[1:52:11] the doctrin the ideas of man and
[1:52:13] miracles are still taking place in the
[1:52:16] Church of the Living God the way
[1:52:17] Miracles are performed is when God has
[1:52:19] took it his
[1:52:20] word now to
[1:52:22] overcome and to stay with that word in
[1:52:25] the middle of the test is what sets you
[1:52:27] in
[1:52:28] power it's what sets you in power now
[1:52:31] I'm going to visit a scripture that you
[1:52:33] have heard preached I many of you
[1:52:35] probably many times you I I want to just
[1:52:38] put it back in your mind a minute y'all
[1:52:39] remember in Matthew 20 now the sons of
[1:52:43] thunder their mother came to Jesus amen
[1:52:47] and said now can my son sit at your
[1:52:49] right hand and your left hand yes and
[1:52:52] his answer was marvelous he said they
[1:52:55] can be baptized with my baptism and they
[1:52:58] can drink of the cup that I drank of but
[1:53:00] to sit at my right and left hand I
[1:53:02] cannot give them because the position is
[1:53:05] not in existence at this
[1:53:07] time he said it has been predestinated
[1:53:11] for a group that will be coming now I'll
[1:53:13] tell you what brother brandom says the
[1:53:15] position was not in existence at that
[1:53:17] time it will be granted to them who is
[1:53:19] it meant for one to set it one left and
[1:53:21] one at right it will be given after the
[1:53:24] trial
[1:53:25] comes you said what are you talking
[1:53:27] about what the seventh age of leoda is
[1:53:32] the great trial of the church yeah it's
[1:53:35] the great testing of the church it's the
[1:53:38] time when the Antichrist in Matthew 24
[1:53:41] becomes so close and deceiving and so
[1:53:44] close it would deceive in every Point
[1:53:47] except the
[1:53:48] word but at that moment is when the
[1:53:51] bride overcomes and the Overcomer of
[1:53:55] Revelations 3 is the man and woman of
[1:53:58] Matthew 20 it's after the test comes
[1:54:01] that's when they'll be seated then this
[1:54:03] seating is something that is meant for
[1:54:05] the end time in Ephesians chapter 1 the
[1:54:09] Bible says that with all spiritual
[1:54:10] blessings we are put in Heavenly places
[1:54:13] brother Bram said
[1:54:16] positions
[1:54:17] positions positions he chapter 2 we have
[1:54:21] been raised up together to sit in
[1:54:23] Heavenly places in Christ isn't that
[1:54:27] something he's lifted you up and set you
[1:54:31] in a
[1:54:33] position above your
[1:54:36] enemy brother pom says you have been re
[1:54:39] raised up risen with him manifested
[1:54:42] attributes of God setting in the
[1:54:44] Heavenly places already raised
[1:54:46] resurrected to New Life setting in the
[1:54:49] heavenly places in Christ that means so
[1:54:51] much nowadays Church it means so much to
[1:54:54] see ourselves positionally placed in
[1:54:59] Christ now what's he saying we are
[1:55:02] already seated with him yes now can I
[1:55:06] just cut to the Chase and say something
[1:55:08] to you real straight Jesus said don't
[1:55:11] you know it's written in the scripture
[1:55:12] that you are
[1:55:15] Gods now just just get out of the weeds
[1:55:19] get out of the bus and get out in the
[1:55:20] Fairway a minute Jesus said you are
[1:55:24] Gods quit batting around in religion and
[1:55:27] worried about somebody hit it over the
[1:55:28] fence and you're out looking for it in
[1:55:30] the bushes get out in the Fairway you're
[1:55:33] God's forget AR with your heritage and
[1:55:36] your genetics and all of the issues
[1:55:39] Jesus said you are gods don't you know
[1:55:41] the scripture says this of
[1:55:43] you I don't have time to preach it but
[1:55:45] I'll say this is amazing to me because
[1:55:48] this is exactly why the devil said Jesus
[1:55:50] couldn't be him because he would
[1:55:54] suffer but it's amazing to me that the
[1:55:56] Bible said them that live Godly in
[1:55:58] Christ shall suffer persecution so not
[1:56:02] only are we suffering it is predicted
[1:56:04] that we would suffer great are the
[1:56:06] afflictions of the
[1:56:07] righteous but God will deliver them
[1:56:10] through them
[1:56:12] all if I had time I'd preach another
[1:56:14] sermon right now we've been Afflicted
[1:56:17] but brother we're not
[1:56:18] defeated let the weak say they're strong
[1:56:21] let the poor say that they're
[1:56:24] rich I don't care what your body feels
[1:56:26] like tonight say I'm Ill it don't matter
[1:56:29] how low your spirit is I'm
[1:56:35] Victorious according to Genesis chapter
[1:56:37] 1 you've been given Dominion you were
[1:56:39] created for Dominion I love a prophet I
[1:56:42] I love a prophet don't
[1:56:44] you if his word is absolute truth this
[1:56:48] may choke you to death but you you know
[1:56:50] that men and women are sons and
[1:56:51] daughters are amateur
[1:56:52] Gods Amen Let me put the bottom of the
[1:56:55] quote amen the sons of God will be
[1:56:57] manifested when the power of God will
[1:56:59] walk out and will take every Power that
[1:57:02] Satan's got away from
[1:57:05] him bro oh brother over in the
[1:57:09] Millennium no
[1:57:11] sir no sir right here tonight sons of
[1:57:15] God will take every Power Satan has away
[1:57:17] from him you say they going to do it
[1:57:20] just like Jesus did it brother Ram said
[1:57:23] he never used one
[1:57:26] gift I'm so glad he didn't you know why
[1:57:29] you know why he said he didn't use gifts
[1:57:31] he said because there would be a lot of
[1:57:33] people in the end that wouldn't have
[1:57:34] that kind of gift he said so he used the
[1:57:37] word to set the weakest Christian in
[1:57:40] power over the devil amen if you could
[1:57:42] just say it is written you have been
[1:57:45] given dominion over the devil tonight
[1:57:48] maybe you don't have a special gift like
[1:57:50] some of the Great Men of God do but God
[1:57:53] gave you his word and if you can take
[1:57:55] that word you can take back everything
[1:57:58] the devil has taken from you and say
[1:58:01] Satan I am in power
[1:58:07] [Music]
[1:58:09] tonight oh when the church gets the
[1:58:11] revelation of the two spirits that work
[1:58:12] within the
[1:58:13] church y'all remember the quote she can
[1:58:16] do the greater work she will be an
[1:58:19] invincible
[1:58:22] Army now it's
[1:58:25] amazing if she gets the Revelation
[1:58:28] within the framework of the church by
[1:58:29] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:58:30] Antichrist Spirit
[1:58:33] Satan will be
[1:58:37] powerless before
[1:58:39] her now he knows if these people get the
[1:58:43] true Revelation if they get the
[1:58:46] transfer of the infinite into this
[1:58:48] finite mind
[1:58:49] mind they would take a revelation out of
[1:58:52] that that they were sons of God to begin
[1:58:55] with and whatever the devil has done to
[1:58:58] this son in time can't change what God
[1:59:00] did in
[1:59:02] eternity Satan does not have the power
[1:59:06] to change
[1:59:08] eternity and if you have eternal life
[1:59:11] you always were Eternal and God has came
[1:59:14] to redeem the Eternal attributes that he
[1:59:17] had in his mind before the world again
[1:59:20] and the devil can have every temper

[2:06:46] think of this often when netan IH who
[2:06:47] the Israelites stood over there in
[2:06:48] Israel not too many years ago and the
[2:06:50] whole world was attacking him and you
[2:06:52] know what he said he said if I have to
[2:06:54] I'll Stand
[2:06:56] Alone one man in the entire world he
[2:06:59] said if I have to stand alone I'll stand
[2:07:03] alone I tell you what I think amen I
[2:07:06] would rather have five people and a
[2:07:10] tambourine out on that street corner and
[2:07:12] enjoying the things of God than a
[2:07:15] houseful of people all formalized and
[2:07:17] intellectualized and sitting down on the
[2:07:19] move of
[2:07:21] God come on
[2:07:26] church I would do it alone if I had to
[2:07:28] but thank God brother Tim we don't have
[2:07:31] to thank God that He gave us good
[2:07:33] pastors good churches good pews good
[2:07:35] music good singers good preachers we
[2:07:38] don't have to stand alone tonight look
[2:07:40] at what God has put in the house look at
[2:07:42] the brothers and the sisters that he's
[2:07:44] put around you you don't have to stand
[2:07:46] alone you can stand with a church Church
[2:07:48] of the Living
[2:07:49] [Applause]
[2:07:51] God the next time somebody says I'm
[2:07:54] against something won't you ask them
[2:07:55] what they're for
[2:07:56] then so I'm against what brother Tim's
[2:07:59] down what what are you for
[2:08:01] [Music]
[2:08:03] then now amen hope I ain't preaching too
[2:08:06] much like a pastor
[2:08:11] tonight you know what this I stand for
[2:08:13] this because I know that when this bride
[2:08:15] recognizes who she is she can do the
[2:08:18] greater work
[2:08:20] when she starts recognizing who she is
[2:08:22] and what she's here for she can do the
[2:08:24] Greater Works do you know that the
[2:08:26] Greater Works is the spoken
[2:08:29] word the greater meaning of the Greater
[2:08:31] Works is the spoken word did the prophet
[2:08:34] of God will tell us like this he'll say
[2:08:36] to this verily I say unto you little
[2:08:38] Gods if you'll say to this mountain and
[2:08:40] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[2:08:42] that what you have said will come to
[2:08:43] pass you can have what you have
[2:08:46] said now the freaking that's that's
[2:08:49] that's not skim milk and Mark let me
[2:08:52] give you the scripture Mark 11 CH 23 for
[2:08:54] verily I say unto you whosoever shall
[2:08:55] say to this mountain be thou removed and
[2:08:57] cast in the sea shall not doubt in his
[2:08:59] heart but Shall Believe the things which
[2:09:01] he sayith shall come to pass he shall
[2:09:03] have whatsoever he
[2:09:06] saith Matthew 17 and 20 Jesus said unto
[2:09:09] them because of the unbelief for verily
[2:09:11] I say unto you if you have the faith as
[2:09:13] a grain of a mustard seed you shall say
[2:09:15] to this mountain remove hence to under
[2:09:17] place and it shall remove and nothing
[2:09:19] shall be impossible to
[2:09:22] you in Matthew 21- 21 Jesus answered and
[2:09:26] said unto them verily I say unto you if
[2:09:28] you have faith and not doubt you shall
[2:09:30] not only do this as which done to a fig
[2:09:33] tree but also if you shall say under
[2:09:36] this mountain be moved and cast in the
[2:09:38] sea it shall be done oh brother brandom
[2:09:42] said that wasn't a mountain of sin he
[2:09:43] was pointing at the Mount of Olives
[2:09:45] right now now when we say this tonight I
[2:09:48] know that it seems extreme but the
[2:09:51] prophet of God says an adoption message
[2:09:52] to the manifestation of the sons of God
[2:09:55] when true Sons born Sons filled Sons
[2:09:57] speak the word it is backed I believe
[2:10:01] we're on the border of it right now yes
[2:10:03] sir say to this mountain and let it be
[2:10:07] now Romans the 8th chapter the 19th
[2:10:09] verse it said the earnest expectation of
[2:10:10] the creature waiteth for the
[2:10:12] manifestation of Sons The Prophet says
[2:10:16] this is the day of the manifestation of
[2:10:19] the sons of God when the Mysteries
[2:10:21] that's been hid since the foundation of
[2:10:23] the world have been made known this is
[2:10:25] the
[2:10:25] hour
[2:10:27] Hallelujah that's a lot of words
[2:10:29] stacking up there the prophet said in
[2:10:32] Israel and the church he said there will
[2:10:33] be a real genuine anointing the Holy
[2:10:35] Ghost called out church he said they'll
[2:10:38] speak the
[2:10:39] word and it'll flash like
[2:10:42] lightning you know that we're living in
[2:10:44] a season that the prophet of God said
[2:10:47] limbs would be added were they've been
[2:10:49] missing
[2:10:53] before limbs that are missing off of
[2:10:56] people somebody said well how did he do
[2:10:58] it God created the first
[2:11:01] one if he can create a squirrel he can
[2:11:04] create an arm if he can create a
[2:11:06] squirrel he can create an eye you know
[2:11:10] several years back sister Carla sitting
[2:11:11] right there you remember that baby that
[2:11:13] white Camp baby when it didn't have
[2:11:15] kidneys amen and we took a prayer cloth
[2:11:17] went all across America having prayer
[2:11:18] for that baby and and you guys prayed
[2:11:20] for that baby and God grow kidneys in
[2:11:23] that child it didn't have organs but God
[2:11:27] gave it
[2:11:32] organs because a prayer of faith changes
[2:11:37] things I believe missing limbs could be
[2:11:39] added I believe whatever God did he
[2:11:41] could do it
[2:11:43] again now now folks I I believe this
[2:11:45] tonight you said preacher amen I'll tell
[2:11:48] you what these are hard things to
[2:11:49] believe but brother Bram said the same
[2:11:50] creative life that you see is in you and
[2:11:53] if you're a prisoner you can speak it
[2:11:55] and it'll and when it speaks it won't be
[2:11:59] you that spoke it will be God that
[2:12:03] spoke do you know the prophet said that
[2:12:06] the Holy Ghost is tabernacling
[2:12:11] deity then your bodies is the Temple of
[2:12:14] the
[2:12:16] Dynamics deity is not in
[2:12:19] heaven
[2:12:21] Hallelujah deity is in you now I know
[2:12:25] that you have so diminished your own
[2:12:28] personal self that you think that God in
[2:12:31] you is
[2:12:33] powerless but wouldn't it be something
[2:12:35] tonight if we took a chunk of uranium
[2:12:37] and we put it in a plastic bag and we
[2:12:39] brought that plastic bag and handed it
[2:12:40] to you do you think uranium could hurt
[2:12:42] you in a plastic
[2:12:44] bag well maybe you put it in a Piggly
[2:12:46] Wiggly bag
[2:12:49] maybe you put it in a brown
[2:12:51] bag maybe you put in a plastic bag
[2:12:54] uranium is still
[2:12:57] uranium and he still has just as much
[2:12:59] power whether it's in a paper bag or not
[2:13:02] in a paper bag and God is so
[2:13:06] powerful that you can put him in a young
[2:13:08] person or an old person an educated
[2:13:12] person or an uneducated person you can
[2:13:15] put him in a preacher or a teacher you
[2:13:18] can put him in a Schoolhouse you can put
[2:13:20] him in a mom you can put him in a
[2:13:22] daughter he still is
[2:13:27] God come on Church the Holy Ghost is not
[2:13:30] the second person of the
[2:13:32] godhead it is God and that God is in you
[2:13:36] and when you speak deity speaks look how
[2:13:40] the prophet in the wonders of unity he's
[2:13:41] preaching like this and he fills that
[2:13:43] Spirit he said Satan you know the
[2:13:45] scripture on
[2:13:46] that
[2:13:48] I love it Prophet said Satan you know
[2:13:51] the scripture on that I've just taught
[2:13:53] the people that God is in them and if
[2:13:56] God is in them and they speak to that
[2:13:58] disease and say be away from me and
[2:13:59] don't doubt it in their heart right then
[2:14:02] that disease has to
[2:14:04] move for it's not them that speaks it's
[2:14:07] the father that dwelleth in them
[2:14:11] speaking oh my goodness if the Holy
[2:14:13] Ghost could do the talking tonight if
[2:14:16] you could overcome yourself the Holy
[2:14:18] Ghost do the
[2:14:20] talking God has took his power and put
[2:14:23] it amongst human beings you know he said
[2:14:25] this is the last thing that would happen
[2:14:27] in the church my new ministry the last
[2:14:30] thing that I know of there's nothing
[2:14:32] else it will be given to human beings to
[2:14:34] ask anything they desire and whatever
[2:14:36] they ask it shall be given to them
[2:14:39] Hallelujah speak to the mountain brother
[2:14:41] bam said I wanted to happen now that
[2:14:43] that anointing will strike the whole
[2:14:45] Church of the Living God she'll raise to
[2:14:46] her feet like a mighty marching Army the
[2:14:49] sick will be healed the word the blind
[2:14:51] will see the death will hear the dead
[2:14:52] will be raised up the power of God will
[2:14:54] shake the world with the Church of the
[2:14:56] Living God we're in the process of it
[2:15:00] now my goodness I don't believe we are
[2:15:03] to ever live under our
[2:15:06] privileges but I believe we will live to
[2:15:09] the time of the maturing of the wheat
[2:15:12] seed I believe we're living in the
[2:15:14] harvest season when the alpha has become
[2:15:18] the Omega when the first has become the
[2:15:21] last I don't believe we're looking for
[2:15:23] that bride to rise up brother I believe
[2:15:26] she's
[2:15:27] here I believe the bride has resurrected
[2:15:31] and she's alive tonight I don't believe
[2:15:33] the mind of God is off there 10 million
[2:15:36] miles away I believe I'm looking at the
[2:15:38] very literal mind of God in flesh
[2:15:40] sitting here
[2:15:42] tonight brother I'll tell you this I
[2:15:44] find out this thing I believe the
[2:15:46] prophet of God said when man begins to
[2:15:48] speak his word he said now watch the
[2:15:50] translation of that scripture and it
[2:15:52] doesn't say quickly the mountain will be
[2:15:55] moved he said but actually it says by
[2:15:58] and by the mountain will be moved he
[2:16:01] said when you speak it and don't doubt
[2:16:03] it in your heart he said he said it
[2:16:06] translates and believe that it is
[2:16:12] happening you know how how things feel
[2:16:14] different when you know something's
[2:16:16] happening I was telling the church the
[2:16:19] other day I just I just broke my phone
[2:16:21] and uh and and and uh I called the place
[2:16:24] and they saidwell you got insurance on
[2:16:25] it so I called the AT&T and and they
[2:16:27] called me right back it's about 1:00 the
