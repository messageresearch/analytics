[42:59] and just take control of this vessel
[43:01] Lord push aside the struggles let's
[43:04] decide the worries Lord push aside

[43:08] and allow us just to step into your lord
[43:10] to your anointing and allow you to speak
[43:12] Lord and for each one present here Lord
[43:14] that they themselves would be be able to
[43:16] press through all the hindrances of the

[43:28] everything from this point forward that
[43:30] you'll just be in complete control in
[43:32] the name of Jesus we pray amen amen
[43:36] if you have your Bibles and you'd like
[43:38] to turn with me to the Book of Joshua
[43:41] the sixth chapter
[43:44] Joshua 6.
[43:47] and we'll read at the 23rd verse
[43:51] 6 in the 23rd verse
[43:54] amen isn't it good to be in the house of
[43:56] the Lord tonight
[43:58] amen it's wonderful to be able to cast
[44:00] all of our cares upon Him
[44:03] amen verse 23 says
[44:06] and the young men that were spies went
[44:08] in
[44:09] and brought out Rahab and her father and
[44:13] her mother and her Brethren and all that
[44:15] she had and they brought out all her
[44:18] Kindred and left them without the camp
[44:20] of Israel
[44:21] and they burned the city with fire and
[44:23] all that was therein
[44:25] only the silver and the gold and the
[44:27] vessels of brass and of iron they put
[44:29] into the treasury of the house of the
[44:31] Lord and Joshua saved Rahab the Harlot
[44:34] alive and her father's household and all
[44:37] that she had and she dwelleth in Israel
[44:40] even unto this day amen you may have
[44:44] your seats this evening
[44:47] amen
[44:48] I'm so thankful tonight for a message
[44:50] that gave us a promise
[44:52] a promise that that that I'm not going
[44:55] to leave you in this world that's about
[44:57] to be destroyed not only did it give us
[44:59] a promise but it gave us instructions to
[45:01] to what to do to to make sure that that
[45:04] we get out of here and and as we're
[45:07] thinking about this just for a moment I
[45:09] do want to say to the young people that
[45:10] were we are praying for you this weekend
[45:12] as as you go to Oklahoma and they're
[45:15] part of that youth camp and and I pray
[45:17] that as you go it'll it'll be more than
[45:19] just a social experience or just some
[45:22] good services but that you will really
[45:24] get a hold of that which you really need
[45:26] that you'll you'll anchor down and and I
[45:29] like how brother Mike sang that song
[45:31] because sometimes as young people we
[45:33] have experiences and then we'll flounder
[45:35] for a while but I just want to remind
[45:37] you he didn't bring you this far to lose
[45:39] you you know and you're not forgotten
[45:41] and you're not Forsaken and and we are
[45:43] praying for you this weekend but
[45:45] it's so important now more than ever
[45:47] that we have that anchor because we live
[45:49] in a world that is absolutely full of
[45:52] Chaos and I want to speak to you tonight
[45:54] for for a thought for a little bit in
[45:57] the midst of chaos you're coming out in
[46:01] the midst of chaos you're coming out and
[46:03] the Lord had dropped this thought in my
[46:05] heart just the other day during service
[46:07] and and it was very specific
[46:10] and the thought just kept coming over
[46:12] and over again you're coming out
[46:13] you're coming out and I began to look at
[46:15] it I just pray that I can relay it to
[46:17] you tonight because we do live in a
[46:19] world full of chaos and I think one of
[46:21] the most frustrating things for people
[46:23] with even a little bit of common sense
[46:25] or a little bit of decency about them is
[46:27] is how so many people act like that
[46:29] what's happening in our world is okay
[46:31] that they they seem to act like that
[46:34] that
[46:35] um things this is normal and this is
[46:37] right when we can clearly see if you
[46:39] have any bit of Sanity about you that
[46:41] what's going on in our world is pure
[46:43] insanity and and brother Branham says so
[46:46] so it throws the whole world into
[46:48] Insanity the whole thing is insane and
[46:51] so it gradually crept in until the
[46:54] people don't know it and when we can
[46:56] look around and see that that's true to
[46:58] where you know the if you try to explain
[47:00] to them that they're insane they would
[47:02] think you were crazy or you'd be labeled
[47:04] some kind of a bigot or some kind of
[47:06] old-fashioned person that just isn't up
[47:08] to the times and we live in a time where
[47:11] roles are being switched where where men
[47:13] are claiming to be women and women are
[47:16] claiming to be men and you know I saw a
[47:18] headline today that doesn't really have
[47:20] a lot to do with this but it just
[47:21] shocked me it said for the first time in
[47:23] history women drink more alcohol than
[47:25] men do and they just it just jumped out
[47:28] at me and it was a shocking thing to
[47:30] read and I I realized that morals in
[47:33] this day are all but gone and yet people
[47:35] want to act like we're The Crazy Ones
[47:37] you know people want to act like that
[47:39] we're crazy or for that matter anyone
[47:41] who claims Christianity the world is
[47:43] labeling them as bigots you know not
[47:45] even message Believers you could be a
[47:47] good Baptist or something like that and
[47:49] to the world you are so old-fashioned
[47:52] and wrong and you're full of hate and
[47:54] and we don't have to look very far to
[47:56] find the insanity our stories are full
[47:59] of insanity our schools are full of
[48:02] insanity the entertainment that's put
[48:04] out there for people to feed upon is
[48:06] full of insanity and the leadership of
[48:09] our government from the very top all the
[48:12] way down is full of absolute Insanity it
[48:16] has infiltrated every aspect of the life
[48:18] of this world and and it was prophesied
[48:21] to be so these aren't things that should
[48:23] shock us or catch us off guard we knew
[48:25] these things were coming it just seems
[48:27] like for a long time we felt like we
[48:28] were in the insanity and you thought
[48:30] well surely it can't get any worse and
[48:32] then you wake up the next day and it got
[48:34] worse
[48:35] prophet of God says now look at the
[48:37] position everybody will admit she's in a
[48:40] Sodom condition I passed over California
[48:42] here the other day and got a hold of a
[48:44] magazine or a paper read where
[48:46] homosexuals had increased 60 percent in
[48:49] the last year see oh my it's pitiful see
[48:52] it's just because women has thrown
[48:54] themselves away that's right and just on
[48:56] the street naked it's just it's just a
[48:59] shame but the Bible said they'd be that
[49:01] way in other words nothing's out of
[49:03] order nothing's out of kilter this is
[49:05] exactly what the Bible said was going to
[49:08] happen he says and even to men it's just
[49:11] they're changed see and it's going to
[49:14] get worse in another if the world would
[49:18] stand another 50 years the whole world
[49:20] would be totally insane so I did a
[49:25] little basic math 1964 plus 50 years
[49:29] 2014. so we are well into Total Insanity
[49:34] we're we're beyond that that that that
[49:37] realm and we've stepped into a realm of
[49:39] Total Insanity and we see the world
[49:41] around us is shaking I feel like even
[49:45] even people in the world you know for
[49:47] the first time are admitting you know
[49:49] something's happening we're at the end
[49:50] time something something's wrong and
[49:52] they're recognizing that because the
[49:54] world around us is shaking and we have
[49:56] major Banks crashing and economic fears
[50:00] are the highest we've seen since 2008.
[50:02] just this week Silicon Valley Bank which
[50:05] catered to many of the world's most
[50:07] powerful Tech investors collapsed on
[50:09] Friday it was taken over by the federal
[50:11] Regulators becoming the largest U.S Bank
[50:14] to fail since the 2008 Global financial
[50:17] crisis then on Sunday Regulators grew
[50:20] concerned over the Financial Health of
[50:22] New York's signature bank now both banks
[50:24] are under the control of the Federal
[50:26] Deposit Insurance Corporation or the
[50:29] FDIC
[50:31] we look around and we see the world is
[50:33] on the premises of of World War III
[50:35] which we all know if that was to happen
[50:37] would end and and and atomic destruction
[50:42] just yesterday's headlines as I was
[50:44] looking through these were just
[50:46] yesterday's headlines Russian jet downed
[50:49] U.S drone over Black Sea Russian
[50:52] ambassador to to the U.S says the
[50:54] incident is a provocation
[50:56] belarus's leader leaders Iran visit is
[51:00] an extension of deepending relationships
[51:02] between Moscow and the Tehran the U.S
[51:04] says
[51:06] um Xi Jinping vows to make China's
[51:09] military a great wall of Steel in his
[51:11] first speech of the new presidential
[51:13] term
[51:14] in recent weeks Western allies including
[51:16] Germany the United States and United
[51:18] Kingdom have promised to ship tanks to
[51:20] the Ukraine to help its Forces fight
[51:23] back against a Russian offensive that is
[51:25] expected to begin when weather
[51:27] conditions improve in the spring
[51:30] you can't outrun prophecy
[51:33] these things that have been prophesied
[51:35] down through time are now staring us
[51:37] right in the face and it's no longer
[51:38] something that's out in the future I
[51:40] believe we can look around and we can
[51:43] see the world is in total chaos I look
[51:47] at these events surrounding these
[51:49] different countries through this lens
[51:51] and that is that every one of these
[51:53] kingdoms belong to Satan and so I know
[51:56] that every one of them Must Fall
[51:59] brother Branham says and then he took
[52:01] him upon the Pinnacle of the temple and
[52:03] then he taken him from there upon a
[52:04] mountain and here's what shocks people
[52:07] and he showed him all the kingdoms of
[52:09] the world in a moment of time just think
[52:11] of that in other words he opened up and
[52:14] he saw all the kingdoms of the world the
[52:16] United States Russia Great Britain all
[52:19] of them he said these are mines Satan
[52:23] did Jesus knowed they was his he says to
[52:26] him and I'll give them to you if you'll
[52:28] fall down and worship me brother Branham
[52:30] says the Bible says that they're
[52:32] controlled by Satan that's the reason we
[52:36] have wars
[52:37] and yet although it may seem as if and
[52:39] and you're going to say oh really I
[52:41] don't tell you all that to paint a
[52:43] picture of Gloom
[52:44] because if you just get hung up right
[52:46] there and you sit right there long
[52:48] enough all those things are very gloomy
[52:50] things they're things that would would
[52:51] cause you to get distracted and worried
[52:53] and because of that but I don't paint
[52:55] that picture for you because that's not
[52:57] to be our picture that's not the picture
[53:00] of the Bride in the last day and
[53:02] although those things are prophesied and
[53:04] they can be used as signs of where we're
[53:07] at that is only drawing from the
[53:10] negative side but the picture that we're
[53:13] to focus on tonight is that in spite of
[53:16] all that in spite of what's happening
[53:19] there is a broad standing on the earth
[53:21] tonight there is a broad standing in
[53:24] power there is a broad restored back and
[53:26] she's getting stronger and stronger each
[53:28] and every day that is our picture she's
[53:32] operating more in his power every day in
[53:36] her very existence is just as much of a
[53:39] sign of the end time as the Sodom
[53:41] condition that has taken over the world
[53:43] you are first time not just a son you
[53:47] are the final sign to the Earth that we
[53:49] are in the end time right now so that's
[53:52] the picture that we look to you know
[53:55] Abraham knew that it was the end time
[53:57] but it wasn't because he was connected
[53:58] to Sodom it wasn't because he was
[54:01] Keeping Up with the current events
[54:02] that's not how Abraham knew it was the
[54:04] end time he knew it was the end time
[54:06] because he was receiving his visitation
[54:09] and getting ready to receive the
[54:11] promised son that's how Abraham knew
[54:14] that it was the end time it wasn't
[54:15] because he was focused on Sodom it's
[54:18] because right in the end time God
[54:20] manifested himself in flesh and appeared
[54:23] to Abraham right before the fire fell
[54:26] God came in flesh would you like to know
[54:29] how we know it's the end time because
[54:30] right before the fire falls once again
[54:33] God is manifesting himself in flesh in
[54:37] your flesh in your flesh in your flesh
[54:39] in your flesh that's the sign I'm
[54:41] looking at the world's always been evil
[54:44] but once again God is manifesting
[54:47] himself in the dust of humanity
[54:50] Hallelujah
[54:56] and even though we recognize and we
[54:58] acknowledge the evil that is in the
[55:00] world and we can see how things
[55:03] that bad have gotten how thing how bad
[55:06] things have gotten
[55:07] we can't allow that to become our Focus
[55:12] because a negative Focus will promote a
[55:16] negative report
[55:18] just pay attention to the things you
[55:21] focus on and how it affects the things
[55:23] you say
[55:25] fellowship with somebody that does
[55:26] nothing but feed on the news
[55:28] and you're going to have a negative
[55:30] conversation
[55:31] but sit down with somebody that's been
[55:33] feeding on the word that's been feeding
[55:35] on the Promises that's been looking to
[55:37] the promise and see how that
[55:38] conversation turns a negative Focus will
[55:42] promote a negative report if your focus
[55:45] is constantly on the negative
[55:47] it's going to come out in your testimony
[55:50] your testimony is an indication of what
[55:54] you focus on
[55:56] the testimony of your marriage
[56:00] if you're always running your spouse
[56:02] down
[56:03] tells me what you focus on the testimony
[56:06] of your church
[56:07] the testimony of your pastor or the
[56:09] testimony of your job or the testimony
[56:12] of your men of the ministry or whatever
[56:14] it may be the testimony about your
[56:16] friends whatever you talk about tells me
[56:19] exactly what you choose to focus on
[56:22] and if we begin to focus on the negative
[56:25] and focus on the negative and focus on
[56:27] the negative our report will be a
[56:29] negative report but I believe tonight
[56:31] that there's plenty of positive to look
[56:33] to in the word he said I won't leave you
[56:35] he said I won't forsake you he said I'll
[56:38] have a bride without spot or wrinkle he
[56:40] said there's going to be a Rapture in
[56:42] the last day we got enough positive
[56:44] things to focus on tonight to look away
[56:46] from the negative
[56:51] so instead of keeping our eyes directed
[56:53] and all the evil tonight I want to
[56:56] I want to bring you past the negatives
[56:58] tonight
[56:58] to the positive
[57:00] I want to go beyond the negatives and
[57:02] tell you tonight that a message has come
[57:05] oh there's a lot in this world that's
[57:07] negative but let's talk about a positive
[57:08] for just a minute a message has come in
[57:11] this day and it has spoke a bride into
[57:13] existence in The Darkest Day in Satan's
[57:17] Eden that there is a predestinated bride
[57:20] that no matter how evil things get how
[57:23] dark things get she will not fall she's
[57:26] predestinated not to fall that's a
[57:28] positive I'm looking at tonight oh but
[57:30] things are bad things are tearing me
[57:32] down you're predestinated not to fall
[57:35] tonight I choose to look at that tonight
[57:37] no matter how evil the world gets no
[57:40] matter how bad things get no matter how
[57:42] many people fall away she will stand
[57:45] true
[57:46] she will gain strength each and every
[57:49] day she will walk further into the word
[57:51] further into the promises cleaning every
[57:53] aspect of her land
[57:55] I say tonight that despite the attacks
[57:57] despite the the affections despite
[58:00] everything that's been said the bride is
[58:02] stronger tonight more mature tonight
[58:04] more raps are ready tonight than she's
[58:07] ever been at any point in the ages I
[58:09] will declare to the enemy Satan you have
[58:11] failed you have not stopped this broad
[58:13] you have not stopped this church but
[58:16] we're growing we're progressing and in
[58:18] the midst of the chaos we're coming out
[58:20] in the midst of your evil we're coming
[58:23] out in the midst of everything you've
[58:25] tried to do you can't keep us here we're
[58:28] coming out
[58:29] evening light Tabernacle you're stronger
[58:32] tonight than you've ever been
[58:39] brother Brown says you're always
[58:40] pointing how Wicked the world's getting
[58:43] but you fail to see how powerful the
[58:45] church is getting at the same time
[58:47] she is rising up standing on the field
[58:49] oh she's a little flock but brother God
[58:53] is with her
[58:54] that's enough right there what else do I
[58:57] need I uh you know yeah sure I love
[58:59] friends I love people around me but at
[59:01] the end of the day if God is with me
[59:04] then who can stand before me he says
[59:06] she's a little flock but brother God is
[59:08] with her
[59:09] and she is going to Triumph just as
[59:12] certain as Christ rose from the dead
[59:13] amen God's Church shall never fail the
[59:17] Gates of Hell shall not prevail
[59:20] against it
[59:25] we know that Satan
[59:27] Causes Chaos
[59:29] he Causes Chaos in the world
[59:32] in governments
[59:34] in churches
[59:36] in your personal life
[59:38] in your spirit in your mind
[59:41] these are the storms
[59:44] these are the battles that we're all
[59:46] going to face
[59:47] that we're all going to go through and
[59:49] it seems at times you're going to be
[59:50] completely overwhelmed
[59:52] let's just be honest it seems at times
[59:54] you don't feel like you can take another
[59:55] step
[59:56] it seems sometimes that you just can't
[59:59] make it
[1:00:01] because it's just so chaotic everything
[1:00:03] seems so out of kilter everything seems
[1:00:06] so messed up the prophet of God says how
[1:00:08] beautiful it is to find that the true
[1:00:11] and living God still lives today in the
[1:00:14] midst of all the chaos still God lives
[1:00:18] and God Reigns that means right now in
[1:00:22] the midst of your trial God Reigns right
[1:00:25] now in the midst of your chaos god
[1:00:27] reigns right now in the midst of your
[1:00:29] family struggle god reigns right now in
[1:00:32] the midst of your lost loved one being
[1:00:34] out there I'd like to declare to you
[1:00:36] tonight that God still lives and God
[1:00:38] still Reigns how can I have peace when
[1:00:41] everything's going wrong how can I have
[1:00:43] peace when the doctor says they've given
[1:00:45] up hope how can I have peace when my
[1:00:47] loved ones farther away than ever before
[1:00:48] when sickness is around us more than
[1:00:50] ever before because in the midst of the
[1:00:53] chaos God still lives and God still
[1:00:57] Reigns you can have peace tonight God's
[1:01:00] on the throne God's in your a situation
[1:01:02] God is in complete control God still
[1:01:05] Reigns tonight in every situation
[1:01:10] and I have a word for you tonight
[1:01:13] you're coming out of it
[1:01:16] I say tonight in the name of the Lord
[1:01:18] whatever your battle whatever your
[1:01:19] struggle whatever your situation he says
[1:01:22] you're coming out of it you're not
[1:01:24] coming out of it defeated you're not
[1:01:26] coming out of it beat down you're not
[1:01:27] coming out of a dragon but you are
[1:01:30] coming out Victorious as an overcomer
[1:01:32] you are coming out The Virtuous sinless
[1:01:34] spotless bride of Jesus Christ you are
[1:01:38] coming out of it tonight
[1:01:43] the oppression is not forever
[1:01:47] the battle is not forever
[1:01:50] and God is at one bit worried about
[1:01:52] whether or not you're going to come
[1:01:53] through
[1:01:57] this trial was not placed in front of
[1:01:58] you
[1:01:59] to be your end
[1:02:02] this trial is not placed in front of you
[1:02:04] to defeat you
[1:02:06] but you were placed
[1:02:08] directly in line with this trial that
[1:02:10] you would overcome it and that you would
[1:02:13] defeat it
[1:02:14] listen as we hear the near the end of
[1:02:16] time
[1:02:17] and as we get nearer and nearer to the
[1:02:19] final battles
[1:02:21] God is going to make sure that his
[1:02:23] people know how to fight
[1:02:26] God is going to make sure that his
[1:02:28] people still know how to swing a sword
[1:02:30] he is going to make sure that you were
[1:02:32] battle tested
[1:02:34] that you know exactly how to put the
[1:02:35] armor on that you know exactly how to
[1:02:37] take orders and you know how exactly how
[1:02:39] to stand and defend your ground and that
[1:02:41] you know how to take ground when
[1:02:43] commanded to do so
[1:02:45] we got battles to face
[1:02:48] and sure we may not have the same
[1:02:50] battles that the other Christians had
[1:02:51] down Through the Ages
[1:02:53] we may not have to go down into the into
[1:02:55] death as a martyr
[1:02:57] we may not have to run and hide into the
[1:02:59] underground in order to have a church
[1:03:00] service
[1:03:02] we may not have the difficulty of not
[1:03:04] having the word in our own language or
[1:03:06] the Bible you know people gave their
[1:03:08] lives that this Bible could be printed
[1:03:09] in our language
[1:03:11] we may not have those battles
[1:03:14] but I want you to know that God isn't
[1:03:16] afraid to let you be battle tested
[1:03:19] he isn't afraid of opposition
[1:03:21] and he isn't afraid of the chaos that
[1:03:23] Satan has created why because in Exodus
[1:03:26] 15 3 it tells me the Lord is a man of
[1:03:30] war the Lord is his name Psalms 144 and
[1:03:34] 1 says blessed be the Lord my strength
[1:03:37] which teacheth My Hands to War and my
[1:03:41] fingers to fight how does he teach you
[1:03:43] how to do these things
[1:03:45] just by telling you
[1:03:46] just by talking about it with you
[1:03:49] no but he put you to the test of and he
[1:03:52] allows you to go through these things it
[1:03:54] may not be the same battles that
[1:03:55] everybody else has but you can't learn
[1:03:57] how to fight without fighting
[1:04:00] otherwise you ain't nothing but a Shadow
[1:04:02] Boxer and that all goes out the window
[1:04:03] once you get punched in the mouth
[1:04:08] I'll tell you a story brother Tim might
[1:04:10] remember this I used to work for brother
[1:04:12] Tim
[1:04:13] and I'm going to tell you right now I
[1:04:14] don't want to fight brother Tim
[1:04:16] but we're just playing around just
[1:04:18] Shadow Boxing just playing
[1:04:21] and in the midst of it somehow I
[1:04:23] accidentally slapped him right across
[1:04:25] the mouth
[1:04:27] that guy right there
[1:04:31] buddy
[1:04:32] you ain't never seen Retreat mode happen
[1:04:35] so quick and all the apologies and I'm
[1:04:37] sorrys and forgive me Lord have mercy on
[1:04:39] my Souls
[1:04:42] because the truth of the matter is you
[1:04:44] can shadow box all you want but if you
[1:04:47] don't know how to really fight you don't
[1:04:48] want to tangle with somebody like that
[1:04:51] and I'm gonna tell you if you ain't
[1:04:52] battle tested you don't want to be here
[1:04:54] when the things that is coming is coming
[1:04:56] upon this Earth
[1:04:57] the battles that your fits and have to
[1:04:59] face and the trials you're going to face
[1:05:00] I'm not trying to scare you you're going
[1:05:01] to win but you want to know how you're
[1:05:03] going to be ready you're going to be
[1:05:05] battle tested you're going to be
[1:05:07] victorious in this battle which leads to
[1:05:09] a victory in this battle which leads to
[1:05:10] a victory in this battle which leads to
[1:05:12] a victory in this battle that way when
[1:05:14] the next battle shows up you don't even
[1:05:16] Flinch you square your shoulders back
[1:05:17] you draw your sword and you say let's
[1:05:19] get this thing done let's deal with this
[1:05:21] devil right now let's deal with this
[1:05:23] situation right now let's face it right
[1:05:25] now no more running no more hiding I'm
[1:05:28] not gonna hide from this thing I'm gonna
[1:05:30] overcome this thing
[1:05:32] but how does he allow these things to
[1:05:34] happen
[1:05:36] Judges 3 1.
[1:05:38] now these are the Nations
[1:05:41] which the Lord left
[1:05:44] to prove Israel by them
[1:05:47] even as many of Israel had not known all
[1:05:50] the wars of Canaan
[1:05:52] in other words
[1:05:56] but God didn't just take everything away
[1:05:58] and make it a flowery bed of ease for
[1:06:00] you
[1:06:01] he said you're going to have to know how
[1:06:02] to fight too so I'm leaving some things
[1:06:04] for you to deal with
[1:06:06] they could have just wiped them all out
[1:06:08] but then the next Generation would just
[1:06:09] come up and they'd have been soft and
[1:06:11] they wouldn't know how to do a thing but
[1:06:13] he left enemies in the land for the Next
[1:06:17] Generation to deal with he says in verse
[1:06:20] 2 only that the generations of the
[1:06:22] children of Israel might know
[1:06:24] to teach them War
[1:06:27] at the least such as before knew nothing
[1:06:30] thereof
[1:06:32] he's going to allow you to have battles
[1:06:36] he's going to allow you to have trials
[1:06:38] he's going to allow you to have
[1:06:39] difficulties but you're coming out of it
[1:06:42] you're going to overcome you're going to
[1:06:44] come out of it Victorious
[1:06:47] how did he teach them
[1:06:49] by leaving tribes to prove those that
[1:06:53] had not experienced the battles of the
[1:06:55] days gone by notice what he said these
[1:06:57] tribes weren't left to destroy them
[1:07:00] they were left to prove them
[1:07:03] they were left to prove who they were
[1:07:05] this trial isn't left to destroy you but
[1:07:07] it's here to prove who you are it's here
[1:07:11] that there will be no doubt that's the
[1:07:12] Bride of Jesus Christ then not only will
[1:07:15] God know and you will know but the devil
[1:07:16] will know that's somebody I don't want
[1:07:18] to tangle with it has proved exactly who
[1:07:21] the word says she is she is lined up she
[1:07:24] is squared her shoulders back she is
[1:07:26] overcome she is who she says she is it's
[1:07:30] left there to prove who the bride is
[1:07:34] it's going to prove each and every doubt
[1:07:36] or wrong listen there's lots of things
[1:07:37] manifestation always ends the debate
[1:07:42] fulfillment always ends the debate
[1:07:44] oh is she or isn't she oh is there isn't
[1:07:47] there you know that like I've heard it
[1:07:49] said before the birth of Jesus proved
[1:07:51] exactly what Isaiah was talking about
[1:07:53] that ends the debate and I'm telling you
[1:07:56] they can say ask whether or not William
[1:07:57] Branham was a prophet whether he was the
[1:07:59] seventh angel whether he was Malachi 4
[1:08:01] whether or not you're in a cult or not
[1:08:03] but I'm telling you on Rapture morning
[1:08:05] it's going to end the debate the
[1:08:07] Fulfillment of that right there is going
[1:08:08] to end the question they are who they
[1:08:11] said they were it's going to end it once
[1:08:14] and for all
[1:08:15] it's going to approve exactly
[1:08:18] Who We Are
[1:08:21] you know many times
[1:08:23] we get so bogged down in a trial that we
[1:08:25] begin to think it's forever
[1:08:27] we begin to think that this is Who We
[1:08:29] Are
[1:08:30] and the devil begins to lie to you and
[1:08:32] tell you that your situation is
[1:08:33] permanent
[1:08:35] that there's no way out that this trial
[1:08:37] is punishment for your wrongdoings
[1:08:41] that you're always going to have this
[1:08:43] sickness that you're always going to
[1:08:45] have this anxiety
[1:08:46] I'm telling you that this trial and this
[1:08:49] Affliction that you're dealing with is
[1:08:50] temporary
[1:08:51] it is not forever the devil wants you to
[1:08:54] Envision a future to where you're still
[1:08:57] dealing with this struggle
[1:08:59] well you know am I going to be able to
[1:09:01] do this down the road because of this
[1:09:03] arthritis well 10 years from now am I
[1:09:05] going to be able to am I even going to
[1:09:07] be able to do this and this because of
[1:09:08] of this diabetes
[1:09:11] well what's going to happen because you
[1:09:12] know this stuff runs in my family and he
[1:09:14] tries to get you to Envision a future
[1:09:17] to where this sickness still has a hold
[1:09:19] in your life
[1:09:21] a future to where to where when you
[1:09:23] begin to think of the future and in that
[1:09:25] future you are still fighting this same
[1:09:27] fight he's got you exactly where he
[1:09:30] wants you
[1:09:31] but when I begin to think of the future
[1:09:33] I begin to say this dry season in my
[1:09:35] life is temporary this hardship that I'm
[1:09:38] going through right now is temporary my
[1:09:40] future is clear in my future there is
[1:09:43] complete healing in my future there is a
[1:09:45] complete deliverance in my future my
[1:09:47] family is completely restored in the
[1:09:49] future my prodigal has come home I say
[1:09:52] the waters are running clear in your
[1:09:54] future tonight look at the future and
[1:09:57] speak what you have need of because
[1:09:58] you're coming out of this situation it
[1:10:01] is not permanent you are permanent you
[1:10:04] are forever you are Eternal but this
[1:10:07] situation is temporary
[1:10:10] Hallelujah you look at your future and
[1:10:13] in your future there is victory over
[1:10:15] what you face tonight
[1:10:21] pardon me
[1:10:25] got it it's based on acceptance
[1:10:33] well I just can't accept it like that I
[1:10:34] just can't accept I just can't accept it
[1:10:36] by faith well whether you accept
[1:10:39] what God's telling you
[1:10:41] or whether you accept what the devil's
[1:10:43] telling you it's still based on
[1:10:45] acceptance
[1:10:47] you just have to choose which one you're
[1:10:49] going to accept the symptoms or the
[1:10:51] promise
[1:10:53] you got to just make a choice which one
[1:10:55] am I going to accept the symptoms or the
[1:10:58] promise brother Brandon would say
[1:11:00] now they might have said father of
[1:11:02] Nations we heard you 25 years ago say
[1:11:04] you was going to have a child by Sarah
[1:11:06] and out of that was going to come
[1:11:08] nations of people with just how many
[1:11:10] children do you have at this time father
[1:11:12] of Nations
[1:11:14] huh see that's the same old critical
[1:11:16] spirit that would criticize what did
[1:11:19] Abraham
[1:11:20] said he he staggered not at the promise
[1:11:23] through unbelief why here you prayed for
[1:11:25] so and so when they didn't get well that
[1:11:28] doesn't matter if I pray for ten
[1:11:30] thousand tonight and ten thousand die in
[1:11:33] the morning tomorrow night I'll still
[1:11:36] anoint I'll be anointing the sick and
[1:11:37] praying for them because God said so
[1:11:40] doesn't stop it a bit God promised it I
[1:11:43] believe it certainly he says it doesn't
[1:11:46] matter if ten thousand died on this side
[1:11:48] today trusting
[1:11:51] think about it now doesn't matter if ten
[1:11:54] thousand die today trusting ten thousand
[1:11:57] died on that side tomorrow trusting that
[1:12:01] has nothing to do with me
[1:12:04] I'm the individual I'm the one that's
[1:12:07] trusting I'm the one that believes it
[1:12:09] and we see back Yonder if we wanted to
[1:12:12] open up our channels then if we can and
[1:12:15] see we find this one and that one and
[1:12:18] this one and that one thousands of them
[1:12:21] he says testify
[1:12:24] what are they testifying of
[1:12:26] what are all those down Through the Ages
[1:12:28] testifying they're testifying you're
[1:12:31] going to come out of it
[1:12:33] you're going to make it you're gonna
[1:12:35] overcome Sarah was Barren for 90 years
[1:12:38] and she testifies you're coming out of
[1:12:40] it the woman with the issue of blood had
[1:12:42] it for 12 years and she testifies
[1:12:44] tonight you're coming out of it the man
[1:12:47] by the pool of Bethesda he had a
[1:12:49] infirmary in his body for 38 years and
[1:12:53] he testifies tonight you're coming out
[1:12:55] of it you say I've been dealing with
[1:12:57] this for a really really really long
[1:12:59] time Rahab was a harlot for 40 years and
[1:13:03] she testifies tonight you are coming out
[1:13:06] of it oh it's been a really long time in
[1:13:09] my life I've been struggling with this I
[1:13:11] can't hardly overcome it Lazarus was in
[1:13:13] the grave for four days and he testifies
[1:13:16] tonight you're coming out of it you're
[1:13:19] coming out of this situation you're
[1:13:21] coming out of the Grave you're coming
[1:13:22] out of this sickness you're coming out
[1:13:25] of this oppression of hell it is
[1:13:27] temporary
[1:13:29] they testify tonight
[1:13:31] it's not defeating you
[1:13:33] it's proving you
[1:13:39] job 23 10. but he knoweth the way that I
[1:13:43] take when he hath tried me I shall come
[1:13:47] forth as gold now the gold part is great
[1:13:51] and we understand all the significance
[1:13:53] of that but I just want to focus on
[1:13:55] those first four words
[1:13:57] you're going to come forth
[1:13:59] you're coming out of the trial
[1:14:02] you're coming out of the Temptation
[1:14:03] you're not going to be burned up bite
[1:14:05] destroyed bite stuck in it I shall come
[1:14:09] forth
[1:14:11] I love that
[1:14:13] you're going to come out of that just as
[1:14:14] gold refined in the fire you shall come
[1:14:17] forth as gold that is approved and
[1:14:20] improved one writer says he says you're
[1:14:23] going to be found to be good and made to
[1:14:25] be better you're going to come out of
[1:14:27] this better than when you went into it
[1:14:30] Hallelujah First Peter 1 and 6 wherein
[1:14:33] you greatly rejoice
[1:14:36] this one always kind of
[1:14:38] stumped me
[1:14:41] because many times
[1:14:43] you're like why would I rejoice
[1:14:46] through manifold Temptations
[1:14:49] but it says wherein you greatly Rejoice
[1:14:51] though now for a season notice is
[1:14:54] temporary
[1:14:56] if need be you are in heaviness through
[1:14:58] manifold Temptations
[1:15:00] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:15:03] more precious than of gold that
[1:15:04] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[1:15:07] might be found unto praise and honor and
[1:15:10] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:15:13] now verse 6 started with the word
[1:15:14] wherein so if we'll go back to verse 6
[1:15:17] and we'll see it says wherein and so it
[1:15:20] tells us that it's referring back to
[1:15:22] previous verses
[1:15:24] in other words when it says wherein it's
[1:15:27] carrying on from the previous verses
[1:15:28] look at verse 3 and what we find there
[1:15:31] is abundant mercy and a lively hope
[1:15:35] go to verse 4 an inheritance
[1:15:37] incorruptable and undefiled reserved in
[1:15:41] Heaven For You Verse 5 it says that we
[1:15:44] are kept by the power of God then it
[1:15:48] goes to verse 6 and it says all these
[1:15:50] things because of these things wherein
[1:15:53] we greatly rejoice in other words it is
[1:15:57] a season that you're going through a
[1:15:59] season of Trials but all these things in
[1:16:01] verse 3 and verse 4 and verse 5 these
[1:16:05] are Eternal things rejoice in those
[1:16:07] things you may be going through
[1:16:09] something tonight but it's just for a
[1:16:11] season rejoicing your salvation rejoice
[1:16:14] in your eternal life rejoice in the
[1:16:17] restoration of your family rejoice in
[1:16:19] your healing Rejoice that there's a
[1:16:22] Rapture coming to take us
[1:16:24] don't focus on the season of trials that
[1:16:28] you're in
[1:16:29] that's how we greatly rejoice in our
[1:16:32] trial
[1:16:34] in other words
[1:16:36] look at the great things we have in God
[1:16:40] instead of the temporary negative
[1:16:42] situation that's going to end
[1:16:44] and continue to praise him right on
[1:16:47] through it knowing that you're going to
[1:16:49] come out better than you went in
[1:16:51] praising him for the outcome before you
[1:16:53] ever see it
[1:16:55] Hallelujah
[1:16:57] he says greatly rejoice
[1:17:00] because these things are eternal
[1:17:02] but the trials are temporary
[1:17:06] listen the chaos is only for a season
[1:17:10] oh my life is so full of chaos out of
[1:17:13] the chaos
[1:17:14] you're coming out
[1:17:16] it's only for a season it doesn't Define
[1:17:19] you it's not who you are it's not going
[1:17:20] to take you down brother Brown says the
[1:17:23] devil can put out scarecrows and
[1:17:24] everything else
[1:17:26] and make you shadows and say you're
[1:17:28] gonna die in the morning and this is the
[1:17:30] last die-hour and this and that and the
[1:17:33] other but that don't scare the believer
[1:17:35] he's just a bluff if God reveals to me
[1:17:38] it's not going to happen I don't care
[1:17:40] what he says I'm going to come out of it
[1:17:43] anyhow
[1:17:46] but then we get to the hard part
[1:17:48] we can all
[1:17:50] amen those things
[1:17:52] but the hard part is that while we're
[1:17:55] going through it the Lord wants us to
[1:17:57] stay patient
[1:17:58] and positive
[1:18:01] that's hard to do I'm ready be well
[1:18:04] tomorrow
[1:18:06] I'm ready for financial troubles to be
[1:18:08] finished right now
[1:18:10] I'm ready for all the prodigals to come
[1:18:12] home yesterday
[1:18:16] okay but he says be patient
[1:18:19] and be positive
[1:18:21] James 5 and 7
[1:18:25] says be patient therefore brethren
[1:18:29] and why is he wanting us to be patient
[1:18:31] one thing your patience proves a trust
[1:18:35] you know when the little kids they're
[1:18:37] like hey can we go get ice cream and
[1:18:38] you're like yeah
[1:18:39] well a couple hours later like can we
[1:18:41] leave yet can we leave yet can we leave
[1:18:42] really what it is they don't believe
[1:18:44] you're really going to take them
[1:18:47] but the patience proves a trust
[1:18:51] I know you're going to do this so I'm
[1:18:53] just going to sit back and be patient it
[1:18:55] is actually impatience that leads to
[1:18:57] unbelief
[1:18:58] because when it doesn't happen when we
[1:19:00] wanted it to or when we thought it was
[1:19:02] going to happen or when we expect it we
[1:19:04] begin to slowly maybe not with our mouth
[1:19:07] but we slowly give up on it our faith
[1:19:10] begins to weaken but it's due to
[1:19:11] impatience if we didn't put no time
[1:19:14] limit on it then the promise is just as
[1:19:16] good today as it is 10 years from now
[1:19:19] the timing of it means absolutely
[1:19:21] nothing so he's telling you be patient
[1:19:24] therefore Brethren unto the coming of
[1:19:26] the Lord behold the husbandman waited
[1:19:28] for the precious fruit of the earth and
[1:19:30] hath long patience for it until he
[1:19:33] received the early and latter Iran
[1:19:36] what's this mean be patient means bear
[1:19:38] your afflictions without murmuring
[1:19:45] help me Lord
[1:19:48] bear your afflictions without murmuring
[1:19:50] this one we really love and your
[1:19:52] injuries without Revenge
[1:19:55] if someone does you wrong you best not
[1:19:59] try to avenge it
[1:20:03] and though God should not in any signal
[1:20:05] manner appear to you immediately wait
[1:20:09] for him
[1:20:11] verse 8 be ye also patient establish
[1:20:15] your hearts for the coming of the Lord
[1:20:17] draweth nigh
[1:20:19] what's he mean establish your hearts let
[1:20:21] your faith be firm without wavering your
[1:20:24] practice of what is good constant and
[1:20:26] continued without tiring and your
[1:20:28] resolutions for God and Heaven fixed in
[1:20:31] spite of all sufferings or Temptations
[1:20:36] Grudge not one against another
[1:20:39] that is pretty cut and dry
[1:20:42] Brethren now if you actually get into
[1:20:44] this what it's dealing with is this
[1:20:47] he's talking about how so many times
[1:20:50] Christians have patience and forgiveness
[1:20:52] for people in the world and yet the
[1:20:54] minute a brother does them wrong they
[1:20:56] want to hold it over them
[1:21:00] and he says don't hold he's literally
[1:21:02] saying don't hold a grudge against a
[1:21:04] Christian
[1:21:06] don't grudge against one another
[1:21:07] brethren
[1:21:09] lest ye be condemned
[1:21:12] behold the judge standeth at the door in
[1:21:15] other words if your brother's done you
[1:21:17] wrong first of all don't worry the judge
[1:21:19] is out the door he'll deal with it
[1:21:22] but second of all the minute you begin
[1:21:24] to judge you have taken the condemnation
[1:21:26] off of him and you're bearing it for him
[1:21:28] you become the guilty party and the
[1:21:31] judge is at the door for you
[1:21:34] verse 10.
[1:21:36] take my brethren the prophets who have
[1:21:38] spoken in the name of the Lord for an
[1:21:40] example of suffering Affliction and of
[1:21:42] patience
[1:21:44] and here's what we're getting to behold
[1:21:46] we count them happy which endure
[1:21:50] you have heard of the patience of Job
[1:21:52] and have seen the end of the Lord that
[1:21:55] the Lord is very pitiful meaning he's
[1:21:57] full of pity and of Tender Mercies what
[1:22:01] does it mean right there
[1:22:03] where it says and we have seen the end
[1:22:06] of the Lord not that the Lord ended
[1:22:08] surely we know that's not what it's
[1:22:09] talking about it's talking about it's
[1:22:11] relating it back to job
[1:22:13] and it's saying you've seen how job was
[1:22:15] patient you see how he kept believing
[1:22:17] you see how he held on and you see how
[1:22:20] the Lord ended that for him do you see
[1:22:23] how the Lord dealt with his troubles you
[1:22:25] see how the Lord dealt with it yes he
[1:22:27] went through awful times but those times
[1:22:29] were temporary and on the back side of
[1:22:32] it job was blessed greater than he ever
[1:22:34] was on the front side of it so he's
[1:22:36] saying just be patient look what God did
[1:22:38] for job he's going to do the same thing
[1:22:40] for you if you'll just hold on to the
[1:22:43] promise if you'll stay positive if
[1:22:45] you'll stay patient on the back side of
[1:22:47] this thing you're going to be blessed
[1:22:49] more abundantly than you were before you
[1:22:51] went into the trial but you got to stay
[1:22:54] patient
[1:22:55] what did the Lord do in the end although
[1:22:58] it was hard although life was chaos in
[1:23:01] the end he was blessed greater than at
[1:23:03] the beginning in the end all things were
[1:23:05] restored relationships were restored his
[1:23:08] family was restored his wealth was
[1:23:10] restored and his health was restored but
[1:23:14] it points to job's patience
[1:23:17] which proved a trust in God
[1:23:20] amen
[1:23:23] so when you're in the midst of this you
[1:23:25] have to remind yourself
[1:23:27] this troubled time is not the end of me
[1:23:30] because in the midst of the trial it's
[1:23:32] easy to begin to believe in that when
[1:23:33] all you can see is trouble when all you
[1:23:35] can see is heartache when all you can
[1:23:37] see is your depression it's hard to look
[1:23:39] beyond that
[1:23:41] with these eyes and go I'm going to be
[1:23:43] happy I'm going to be blessed but you
[1:23:46] have to fight through the Gloom you've
[1:23:48] got to push back the darkness you've got
[1:23:50] to be willing to stand and swing your
[1:23:52] sword that's exactly what God's wanting
[1:23:54] you to do swing your sword tonight cut
[1:23:57] yourself a path back into the light
[1:23:59] tonight Joe 42 10 says and the Lord turn
[1:24:03] the Captivity of job when he prayed for
[1:24:05] his friends I found this to be very
[1:24:07] interesting
[1:24:09] these are the friends who had accused
[1:24:12] him who had said all kinds of negative
[1:24:14] things about him these are the friends
[1:24:16] that had done him wrong and yet job
[1:24:19] wasn't blessed until he prayed for them
[1:24:24] my
[1:24:27] you would think it needed to be you know
[1:24:28] you know hey y'all got to make
[1:24:30] everything job had to pray for them
[1:24:34] and then God turned the Captivity of job
[1:24:36] when he prayed for his friends also the
[1:24:38] lord gave job twice as much as he had
[1:24:40] before go down to verse 12. so the Lord
[1:24:42] blessed the latter end of job more than
[1:24:45] the beginning
[1:24:47] you're going to come out of this
[1:24:49] you're going to come out of this his
[1:24:51] trials one writer would put it like this
[1:24:54] his trials began in Satan's malice which
[1:24:56] God restrained but his restoration began
[1:24:59] in God's mercy which Satan could not
[1:25:02] oppose I'm telling you when the mercies
[1:25:04] of God are poured out upon your life
[1:25:05] Satan can't oppose it he can't stand
[1:25:08] before you any longer when he begins to
[1:25:10] to restore when he begins to bring back
[1:25:12] when he begins to put you back in the
[1:25:14] position that he had for you all along
[1:25:16] what I want you to notice is it's not
[1:25:18] like in the middle of this trial all of
[1:25:20] a sudden God decided you know what I'm
[1:25:22] going to bless job in this
[1:25:24] you know what I'm going to bring this to
[1:25:25] an end that's going to be good for Joe
[1:25:27] that's not how it was that's what what
[1:25:29] God knew at the very beginning before it
[1:25:31] ever started that was going to be the
[1:25:33] outcome before you ever went into this
[1:25:35] trial because I know the thoughts that I
[1:25:37] have of you thoughts of good and not of
[1:25:39] evil to bring you to an expected end
[1:25:41] this was always going to be the end this
[1:25:43] was always going to be the verdict this
[1:25:45] is always how this fight was going to
[1:25:47] turn out this bride was always going to
[1:25:49] overcome you were always going to
[1:25:51] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:53] you were always chosen in him before the
[1:25:55] foundation of the world it's not just
[1:25:57] right now he's going I'm trying to
[1:25:59] decide whether or not they're going to
[1:26:00] pull through he's telling you tonight
[1:26:02] you're gonna pull through you're gonna
[1:26:04] make it you're gonna come out of this
[1:26:06] thing you're gonna be blessed and you're
[1:26:08] going out and you're coming in you're
[1:26:10] going to overcome
[1:26:12] that's been the decision all along
[1:26:14] that's been how he's felt about it all
[1:26:17] along
[1:26:18] he didn't just turn good thoughts
[1:26:19] towards Jude right there at the uh
[1:26:21] towards job right there at the end
[1:26:24] brother Brown says that instead of
[1:26:26] him getting weaker the Bible said he got
[1:26:28] stronger all the time got stronger when
[1:26:31] he was 100 years old he was still giving
[1:26:33] God praise he was going to have it and
[1:26:36] he did they had this child because God
[1:26:38] said so God is to be took at his word
[1:26:42] What God Says comes to pass no matter
[1:26:44] how long it is what it is God said so
[1:26:47] and you just hold on to it that's all
[1:26:50] just stay with it it will bring you
[1:26:53] through
[1:26:56] there's no reason for you to fear the
[1:26:57] outcome
[1:26:59] you know the trial you're in you know
[1:27:00] the biggest thing Weighing on your heart
[1:27:02] you know the biggest struggle you're
[1:27:04] fighting you know where the devil is
[1:27:06] trying to pull you down to here in
[1:27:07] recent weeks and months there's no
[1:27:10] reason to fear the outcome
[1:27:12] there's no the outcome isn't Up For
[1:27:15] Debate
[1:27:16] you're going to come out of this
[1:27:18] you may go in
[1:27:20] you may be in the middle of it right now
[1:27:22] but you're going to come out of it
[1:27:24] better than when you went in you're not
[1:27:26] going to lose
[1:27:27] you can't lose brother Brown says hold
[1:27:29] to God's unchanging hand when everything
[1:27:31] else is falling it'll stand there and
[1:27:34] hold if you'll stick to it it'll bring
[1:27:36] you out just hold on to it
[1:27:40] and now as we Circle back around to our
[1:27:42] opening scripture where we were with
[1:27:43] Rahab
[1:27:45] that's exactly what Rahab had to do
[1:27:47] she received a message with a promise
[1:27:51] Joshua 2 and 14 says and the man
[1:27:53] answered her our life for yours if you
[1:27:56] utter not this our business and it shall
[1:27:58] be when the Lord hath given us the land
[1:28:00] that we will deal kindly and truly with
[1:28:03] thee verse 18. behold when we come into
[1:28:06] the land Thou shalt bind this line of
[1:28:08] scarlet thread in the window which thou
[1:28:10] didst let us down by and thou shalt
[1:28:12] bring thy father and thy mother and thy
[1:28:15] Brethren and all thy father's household
[1:28:17] home unto thee and it shall be that
[1:28:21] whosoever shall go out of the doors of
[1:28:23] thy house into the street his blood
[1:28:24] shall be upon his head and we will be
[1:28:26] Guiltless and whosoever shall be with
[1:28:28] thee in thy house his blood shall be
[1:28:30] upon our head if any hand come upon him
[1:28:34] what they say to a Rahab it doesn't
[1:28:36] matter how bad it gets
[1:28:38] Rahab it doesn't matter what's going on
[1:28:39] in the streets it doesn't matter what
[1:28:42] you hear going on right outside your
[1:28:43] door it doesn't matter that governments
[1:28:45] are falling it doesn't matter that banks
[1:28:47] are falling it doesn't matter that
[1:28:49] sickness is on the other hand it doesn't
[1:28:51] matter that there's others running away
[1:28:52] it doesn't matter that the walls you're
[1:28:54] trapped in are 20 something feet thick
[1:28:56] Rahab none of that matters no matter
[1:28:58] what happens you stay underneath that
[1:29:00] message you stay underneath that token
[1:29:02] no matter how much chaos begins to come
[1:29:04] you make sure you stay underneath there
[1:29:06] and I promise they made a promise by
[1:29:08] their lives they promised by their life
[1:29:10] that no harm will come to you but you
[1:29:13] are going to come out of this oh Church
[1:29:15] come on this ain't spies we're talking
[1:29:17] about this ain't even a messenger we're
[1:29:19] talking about but he promised by his
[1:29:21] life he promised by his life just stay
[1:29:24] under the token stay under the blood no
[1:29:26] matter how bad it gets no matter what
[1:29:28] the chaos is you're coming out you're
[1:29:31] coming out of it just stay in the house
[1:29:34] stay under the blood you're gonna come
[1:29:37] out of it
[1:29:39] he promises out of the rubble out of the
[1:29:43] chaos you're going to come out
[1:29:46] you're going to make it and not only you
[1:29:49] but there's more coming too because it
[1:29:50] wasn't just Rahab there's more healings
[1:29:53] coming there's more Deliverance coming
[1:29:55] there's more going to be filled with the
[1:29:57] Holy Ghost there's more refillings
[1:29:58] coming there's more families going to be
[1:30:00] restored there's more prodigals coming I
[1:30:03] say let it be my kids Let It Be My Home
[1:30:05] Let It Be My refilling Let It Be My Holy
[1:30:08] Ghost Let It Be My healing there's more
[1:30:11] coming just stay with the message
[1:30:14] don't get caught up in the chaos
[1:30:17] there's more coming
[1:30:19] not a hope so
[1:30:22] but she knew
[1:30:24] it was a no-sew
[1:30:26] I'm coming out
[1:30:28] and my family's coming out of this with
[1:30:29] me
[1:30:31] listen rahab's Faith saved her family
[1:30:35] just like Hattie writes faith and her
[1:30:38] response saved her boys
[1:30:39] just like the Roman centurions Faith
[1:30:42] saved his servant
[1:30:44] you can have faith for your children
[1:30:47] you can have faith for your parents you
[1:30:50] can have faith for that lost loved one
[1:30:52] and that faith can reach the heart of
[1:30:54] God and they can be saved they said you
[1:30:57] get everybody in this house
[1:30:59] I'm telling you Rahab probably didn't go
[1:31:01] up to him and say hey y'all come on in I
[1:31:03] mean if you don't want to that's okay
[1:31:05] it's no big deal it's just gonna all
[1:31:06] Crash and Burn
[1:31:07] but I mean you can come in if you want
[1:31:12] constant prayer constant believing my
[1:31:15] daddy's coming in this house my mama's
[1:31:17] coming in this house my family's coming
[1:31:19] in this house you got to get in this
[1:31:21] house there has to be an urgency
[1:31:22] sometimes we just take this message and
[1:31:24] it's so nonchalant and it's just so I'm
[1:31:26] listening I'm telling you the fire is
[1:31:28] about to fall the fire's about to fall
[1:31:30] and you're going to come out but there's
[1:31:32] others that we want to see come out with
[1:31:33] us and I say urge them to get in the
[1:31:35] house compel them to get in the house
[1:31:37] stay on your knees for him pray for him
[1:31:39] but not only that not and I hope so but
[1:31:43] in a no-so me and my family shall be
[1:31:47] saved
[1:31:53] you have to begin to let Faith arise in
[1:31:55] your heart
[1:31:57] instead of doubt
[1:31:59] you got to look away from the chaos all
[1:32:01] around us in this world
[1:32:02] look away from the negative and begin to
[1:32:04] declare we're coming out
[1:32:07] we're going to make it instead of
[1:32:09] feeling sorry for yourself well
[1:32:11] sometimes
[1:32:12] sometimes it's one step at a time
[1:32:16] sometimes it's just a grain of sand
[1:32:17] moves off that mountain
[1:32:19] but you got to go about moving that
[1:32:21] grain of sand
[1:32:22] you got to go about chipping at the
[1:32:24] thing you got to go about attacking that
[1:32:26] thing you gotta you got to take the word
[1:32:28] and start hitting at it instead of just
[1:32:30] sitting around going this is it well
[1:32:31] yeah I believe the Lord's my healer that
[1:32:34] ain't hitting at the thing
[1:32:35] Satan knows he's a Healer
[1:32:37] you take that and you take thus saith
[1:32:40] the Lord and you start beating that
[1:32:41] thing to death you go on the attack and
[1:32:43] you start beating at it and chipping at
[1:32:45] it and beating at it until you gain a
[1:32:47] little bit of ground and then don't stop
[1:32:49] there but you beat at it some more and
[1:32:51] you fight for it it's not gonna come
[1:32:52] easy but you got to be willing to go
[1:32:55] after it the devil says there's no use
[1:32:57] he makes you afraid to expose him what
[1:32:59] do people think
[1:33:02] he makes you afraid to go on the attack
[1:33:04] makes you afraid to stand up for
[1:33:05] yourself because that's what bullies do
[1:33:09] brother Brown
[1:33:10] said you got to start pecking at it
[1:33:13] he said you Peck right against the shell
[1:33:15] just as hard as you can Hallelujah Satan
[1:33:17] get away I'm coming out of here that's
[1:33:19] it I'm not laying here anymore I'm not

[1:33:31] Eagle that that trip Hammer neck back

[1:33:36] matter how hard the shell was it pecked
[1:33:38] right on through it first thing you know
[1:33:40] he could flop his wings a little if we
[1:33:43] could get some people just to get get
[1:33:45] their wings moving we could just get a
[1:33:47] wing up in the air if we could just get
[1:33:49] something having what's happening is
[1:33:50] you're still caged in that that shell
[1:33:52] you're still stuck there and it's glory
[1:33:54] to God
[1:33:55] well look it may not be much but you're
[1:33:58] going to have to Peck at that thing a
[1:33:59] little bit
[1:34:04] and no no don't don't be ashamed of that
[1:34:06] we all start somewhere
[1:34:08] all right but eventually you're gonna
[1:34:09] get that that Wing out and once that
[1:34:11] wind gets out you can reach over and
[1:34:13] start trying to free the other arm and
[1:34:15] pretty soon your legs get free pretty
[1:34:17] soon your voice gets free and before
[1:34:19] long you ain't bowed no more but you can
[1:34:21] shout the glories of God you can run for
[1:34:23] his glory you can shout You Can Dance
[1:34:25] why because we're emotional no because
[1:34:28] we're free because we fought at it and
[1:34:31] we fought for it and we wouldn't stay
[1:34:33] bound down we wouldn't lay down on the
[1:34:35] Devil's Ground we said I'm coming out
[1:34:37] I'm coming out no matter what I have to
[1:34:40] do I'm coming out
[1:34:43] Hallelujah
[1:34:46] he says he got his wing he could flop it
[1:34:49] a little he was all right
[1:34:50] he said pack your way out that's right
[1:34:52] how do you do it blessed it with thus
[1:34:54] saith the Lord thus saith the Lord thus
[1:34:57] saith the Lord finally you begin to
[1:34:59] smell some fresh air
[1:35:01] thus saith the Lord get your head on the
[1:35:03] outside thus saith the Lord push hard
[1:35:05] now you're coming out
[1:35:08] Hallelujah the bride ain't gonna stay
[1:35:10] caged up
[1:35:12] the bride ain't gonna stay inside some
[1:35:14] some shell
[1:35:16] the bride's going to rise above all the
[1:35:18] chaos
[1:35:20] you know a lot of that chaos is
[1:35:21] religious chaos
[1:35:23] a lot of that chaos is
[1:35:25] the chaos of religion the chaos of man's
[1:35:28] ideas and the chaos of of man's dogmas
[1:35:31] and they begin to wall them in
[1:35:34] with their idea of the message
[1:35:36] ain't no different than than
[1:35:38] denominational walls
[1:35:40] you're walled off
[1:35:42] you're walled in
[1:35:44] I want to tell you the bride's coming
[1:35:45] out
[1:35:47] you can build all them walls you want
[1:35:49] but they're going to fall because the
[1:35:50] bride's coming out
[1:35:52] amen Rahab knew
[1:35:54] that the way the messenger taught her
[1:35:56] was the only way
[1:36:00] look we recognize tonight there's no
[1:36:01] better way than God's provided way
[1:36:04] why do we preach the new birth and the
[1:36:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:08] just like they had on the day of
[1:36:09] Pentecost
[1:36:10] because even though they have tried for
[1:36:13] thousands of years they haven't found a
[1:36:14] better way
[1:36:16] they haven't found a better way we if we
[1:36:19] want to come out of this chaos we got to
[1:36:21] stick to the instructions just like
[1:36:23] Rahab was willing to do they've tried to
[1:36:26] find a better way and it has led to
[1:36:27] churches being full of every unclean and
[1:36:30] hateful bird full of unrepented and
[1:36:33] unchanged people
[1:36:35] that's just the truth because if you're
[1:36:37] not born again then you're just
[1:36:40] unchanged
[1:36:42] you're an unchanged person
[1:36:43] brother Brown says neither have they
[1:36:46] found a better way for a chicken to get
[1:36:48] out of an eggshell than to Peck his way
[1:36:50] out
[1:36:51] he must follow God's provided way in
[1:36:54] order to live amen that works on human
[1:36:57] beings too
[1:36:58] he says that's what's the matter with
[1:37:00] the Christian church today is try to
[1:37:01] accept some manufactured way instead of
[1:37:04] beating its way through to the kingdom
[1:37:06] of God has tried some other way and it
[1:37:08] won't work you will kill your patient
[1:37:10] you will kill your baby God's Baby by
[1:37:13] trying to manufacture some way oh
[1:37:15] there's no need of this boohoo and
[1:37:18] crying there's no need of all this oh
[1:37:21] yes there is
[1:37:25] he says now neither have they ever found
[1:37:27] any better idea for ducks and geese to
[1:37:30] come south from the north than to swarm
[1:37:32] and then fly their way down no other way
[1:37:35] you see before they fly down south or
[1:37:37] fly from the south back North they swarm
[1:37:40] first I've seen some swarming in here
[1:37:42] before
[1:37:43] he says they swarm first listen to him
[1:37:45] describe it before they leave their
[1:37:47] grounds or homes to a new home they
[1:37:49] swarm bees do the same thing they swarm
[1:37:52] that's nature what is it they have a
[1:37:54] Revival they'll all swarm and get
[1:37:57] together you never heard such a noise in
[1:37:59] your life and before we can ever leave
[1:38:02] this habitation to a new one we got to
[1:38:06] swarm in a Revival
[1:38:09] hallelujah amen I believe the prophet
[1:38:12] yes sir he says oh you get around a
[1:38:15] bunch of ducks and geese you never hurt
[1:38:17] so much jabber in all your life what are
[1:38:20] they having a Revival they're fixing to
[1:38:22] take to the air amen I say there were a
[1:38:26] bunch of people about to take to the air
[1:38:28] tonight I said we need a swarm in
[1:38:30] Revival don't try to tell that duck he
[1:38:32] don't need to swarm he knows where he's
[1:38:34] going and he knows God's way is the only
[1:38:37] way and he ain't afraid of it finally
[1:38:41] don't tell him I tell you what just sit
[1:38:43] real quiet and we'll put you all in
[1:38:45] cages we'll put you on a truck we'll
[1:38:47] drive you to south Louisiana let you out
[1:38:48] in the marsh you know where they're
[1:38:49] taking you dumb old duck they're taking
[1:38:51] you to the slaughterhouse
[1:38:54] you better get to swarming and get out
[1:38:56] of there before they get your cage down
[1:38:58] and swarm because we're about to take to
[1:39:01] the skies we're about to take to the air
[1:39:03] and in the midst of this chaos we're
[1:39:05] coming out we're leaving here we're
[1:39:08] going home and we're swarming first
[1:39:10] getting ready to go Hallelujah
[1:39:13] Glory
[1:39:16] you can't convince that duck to sit
[1:39:18] still if he sit still he's gonna freeze
[1:39:20] to death
[1:39:21] he's got to go
[1:39:24] he's got to move
[1:39:27] oh yeah they'll say
[1:39:29] oh just just believe
[1:39:32] just accept it just sit
[1:39:35] still right there we'll take you down to
[1:39:37] the to the marsh and yeah
[1:39:39] you can't have ducks that don't know how
[1:39:42] to battle to get through things
[1:39:44] they got to know what it's like to get
[1:39:46] up in the heavenlies and fight against
[1:39:47] the currents and Fight Against the Wind
[1:39:48] go through every storm and every trial
[1:39:51] but guess what they're flying still the
[1:39:52] same
[1:39:53] they're fighting because if you don't
[1:39:55] if you just Coop them up and drive them
[1:39:56] down there you ended up with an offended
[1:39:58] duck
[1:39:59] softer than a chicken
[1:40:01] that ain't gonna be able to live on its
[1:40:03] own it's got to be hand fed everything
[1:40:05] I say Lord whatever the storm whatever
[1:40:08] the battle whatever I gotta go through
[1:40:10] let me fly let me start moving my wings
[1:40:12] a little bit let me swarm a little bit
[1:40:14] whatever I gotta do to take to the
[1:40:16] heavenlies don't let me be here when the
[1:40:18] walls fall because I see the chaos I
[1:40:20] hear the Earth rumbling I see the wall
[1:40:22] shaking and I don't want to be Earth to
[1:40:24] Mound when it all comes down let me take
[1:40:26] to the heavenlies tonight Hallelujah
[1:40:30] hey man we're going to start bringing
[1:40:31] this down
[1:40:33] they'll tell you just believe just love
[1:40:35] just accept the truth amen you better
[1:40:39] I agree with all that
[1:40:42] but you also better come God's provided
[1:40:44] way of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:40:46] get a new birth experience
[1:40:49] brother Brown says the trouble of it
[1:40:50] today they put their name on the book
[1:40:52] and join church and that's all there is
[1:40:53] to it but God's provided way is to stay
[1:40:56] there and work your way through until
[1:40:57] God gives you the new birth that's
[1:40:59] exactly right pick him out it'll kill
[1:41:02] him
[1:41:03] he says that's what's the matter today
[1:41:05] with people a new birth they all dodge
[1:41:07] it I want you to listen close this is
[1:41:09] the prophet they don't like it oh they
[1:41:12] have substituted something for the New
[1:41:14] Birth come up and believe and that's all
[1:41:16] you have to do the devil believes
[1:41:18] himself and you know he's not born again
[1:41:20] there is a new birth there is something
[1:41:23] that goes with it it's kind of unfitting
[1:41:25] and untasting to the world any birth is
[1:41:28] a mess I don't care where it's at if
[1:41:30] it's in the pig pen or a hospital of
[1:41:32] birth is a mess so is the new birth
[1:41:35] it'll make you do things you didn't
[1:41:37] think you would do
[1:41:40] well I never
[1:41:42] me neither
[1:41:45] but get a hold to the new birth
[1:41:48] it says it'll make you get down at the
[1:41:50] altar and cry and scream and wash the
[1:41:52] pain off your face raise your hands
[1:41:55] praise God speak in tongues and all
[1:41:57] kinds of things the new birth will do
[1:42:00] that because it's God's provided way to
[1:42:02] be born again
[1:42:04] 1964 just in case
[1:42:08] Hallelujah
[1:42:12] Rahab had to do what the messenger said
[1:42:14] to do
[1:42:15] well I prefer a blue cord actually and I
[1:42:17] don't want to hang it in front of my
[1:42:18] window it doesn't necessarily go with my
[1:42:20] Decor in here so I'm gonna hang it over
[1:42:22] by the door
[1:42:25] listen the way you think it should be
[1:42:27] does not matter
[1:42:31] my kids hate it when I say this they'll
[1:42:33] say but I want to and I'll say I don't
[1:42:35] really care what you want to do
[1:42:39] not just sometimes their situations you
[1:42:42] have to say that and some people are
[1:42:44] telling God I really don't want to be
[1:42:45] born that way
[1:42:46] I really don't want to do that I want to
[1:42:48] go to church I want to do the right
[1:42:49] thing but Lord sure he says I really
[1:42:50] don't care what you want I have a
[1:42:52] provided way now you can come that way
[1:42:54] or you can be underneath the rubble
[1:43:01] that's your options
[1:43:03] you can do what we said and hang the
[1:43:05] cord where we said how we said or you'll
[1:43:08] be underneath the rubble with everybody
[1:43:10] else
[1:43:11] but she knew she that she had to do
[1:43:13] exactly what the the spies had told her
[1:43:15] to do she did exactly what the
[1:43:16] instructions said because that is what
[1:43:19] it was going to take in order for her
[1:43:20] and her family to be saved and I'm
[1:43:23] telling you tonight little bride trust
[1:43:25] what the messenger told you to do
[1:43:27] trust what he said to do believe what he
[1:43:30] said do even the things you don't
[1:43:31] understand well why did he have to it
[1:43:33] doesn't matter do you want to escape do
[1:43:35] you want to come out from underneath the
[1:43:38] rubble do you want your family just
[1:43:39] trust what the messenger said because
[1:43:42] there's going to be a lot of Chaos
[1:43:44] listen Rahab you got to trust what we're
[1:43:46] telling you no matter what don't come
[1:43:47] out from underneath this token no matter
[1:43:49] what don't come outside this door
[1:43:50] because there's going to be a lot going
[1:43:51] on the walls of the world are going to
[1:43:53] be falling all around you but you don't
[1:43:55] move you stay right where you're at
[1:43:56] everything's going to be falling apart
[1:43:58] there's going to be death and dying all
[1:44:00] around you but don't you come out and
[1:44:01] look you stay right there with that word
[1:44:03] you stay with that token Rahab is going
[1:44:05] to be loud out there everything you've
[1:44:07] ever known is going to come Crashing
[1:44:09] Down
[1:44:10] it's all going to come crashing down but
[1:44:12] you stay with what the messenger said
[1:44:13] you stay right there underneath the
[1:44:15] token because it's all coming down
[1:44:18] look I hate to be the bearer of bad news
[1:44:20] but everything we know is going to come
[1:44:22] Crashing Down
[1:44:24] but you stay with the message
[1:44:28] prophet of God says but oh this modern
[1:44:30] American day that we're living in now I
[1:44:31] tell you our nation is simply polluted
[1:44:33] there's not a hope left to this nation
[1:44:35] as I see only an old-fashioned Revival
[1:44:38] and according to the scripture it'll
[1:44:39] never be Nationwide so then we're just
[1:44:41] left it'll be a Revival among the people
[1:44:43] the elect of God but it won't be a real
[1:44:46] sweeping Revival to take the whole
[1:44:48] nation never was and never will be and
[1:44:51] this great Kingdom
[1:44:52] has got to fall like all other kingdoms
[1:44:56] to give way to the Eternal kingdom of
[1:44:58] God which should be issued in soon
[1:45:03] but I'd like to declare tonight that
[1:45:04] even though the kingdoms of this world
[1:45:06] are completely Fallen that doesn't
[1:45:07] bother us
[1:45:08] and it shouldn't scare us because it
[1:45:11] isn't God's kingdom that's Fallen all
[1:45:13] around us it's Satan's kingdom that is
[1:45:16] crumbling all around us it's his walls
[1:45:19] that are falling it was Jericho's walls
[1:45:21] that were falling those were the walls
[1:45:23] that had kept her prisoner those were
[1:45:25] the things that had kept her Earthbound
[1:45:27] those are the things that we're
[1:45:28] beginning to see fall remember the world
[1:45:30] is falling apart but it's not our world
[1:45:34] to begin with remember back at the
[1:45:36] beginning he said he took him to a high
[1:45:38] mountain showed him the kingdoms of the
[1:45:40] world every one of them and said they're
[1:45:41] all mine I'll do with them what I want
[1:45:43] you see why we have wars who's the ruler
[1:45:46] of this world now
[1:45:50] church is totally collapsing
[1:45:53] the walls Begin to Fall
[1:45:56] death everywhere
[1:45:57] Rahab can hear screaming outside there's
[1:46:00] people running in the streets there's
[1:46:02] people banging out the door there's
[1:46:04] people needing help don't come out of
[1:46:06] that house right now
[1:46:07] don't come out from underneath there
[1:46:09] you know she was a type of the Gentile
[1:46:11] bride loose from man's ideas loose from
[1:46:14] man's tradition loose from the walls of
[1:46:16] Oppression loose from false doctrines
[1:46:18] and there was a lot of chaos that went
[1:46:20] with her losing there was a lot of chaos
[1:46:22] that came with her Freedom there was
[1:46:24] lots of casualties around her Freedom
[1:46:26] there was lots of people talking bad
[1:46:28] about the messengers that had brought
[1:46:29] her the message of her Freedom a lot of
[1:46:32] people didn't believe the reports of the
[1:46:34] supernatural that was going on down in
[1:46:36] the camp of Israel and many began to
[1:46:38] take refuge in the walls man-made walls
[1:46:42] and that's where they took their Refuge
[1:46:44] but she took her Refuge under the
[1:46:46] promise token she took Refuge into
[1:46:48] promise it says if you will stay with
[1:46:50] this you're coming out of it if you'll
[1:46:52] stay under this message none of this is
[1:46:54] going to hurt you but you are going to
[1:46:56] walk out of here free you are going to
[1:46:58] walk out of here loose oh that was a lot
[1:47:00] of Destruction but what the destruction
[1:47:01] did is it wiped out her past what the
[1:47:04] destruction did is it wiped out any
[1:47:06] remembrance of who she once was and she
[1:47:09] set there she said I'm coming out I'm
[1:47:12] coming out I'm coming out and it's a new
[1:47:15] me it's a new birth it's a new person

[1:47:31] that's how Harlot rahab's house stood on
[1:47:34] the walls of Jericho when all the rest
[1:47:35] of it fell because there was a Scarlet
[1:47:37] thread down on the inside
[1:47:39] on the outside and God honored the
[1:47:42] Scarlet Street
[1:47:44] church just like we started talking

[1:47:48] chaos
