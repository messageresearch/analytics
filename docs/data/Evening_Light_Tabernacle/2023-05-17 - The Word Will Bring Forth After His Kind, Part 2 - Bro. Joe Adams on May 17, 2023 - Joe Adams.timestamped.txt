[37:13] amen how many you love the Lord tonight
[37:15] I tell you
[37:17] sure have been enjoying brother
[37:18] Timothy's Ministry the last couple
[37:19] services
[37:21] all right come on now let's do better
[37:23] than that
[37:24] you'll give the man a complex
[37:27] we've enjoyed the word he's done a
[37:29] fantastic job and just yielding himself
[37:31] to the spirit allowing the Lord to use
[37:33] him and you know again I'm just so
[37:35] thankful to be a part of this ministry
[37:36] team to you know we have we have
[37:39] something great here at church
[37:41] just glad to be a part of it put my
[37:42] shoulder to the wheel tonight to be able
[37:45] to minister to you we want to pick back
[37:46] up on where we spoke last time I spoke a
[37:49] couple weeks ago on the word we bring
[37:51] forth I want to speak to you the word
[37:52] will bring forth and we'll do a part two
[37:54] tonight and I have probably several
[37:56] other parts but we're not going to get
[37:57] into all those parts tonight we're going
[37:58] to focus on part two so we look here in
[38:01] John 1 and verse 1. the Bible says that
[38:04] in the beginning was the word the word
[38:06] was with God and the Word was God verse
[38:10] 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[38:13] Among Us and we beheld his glory the
[38:16] glory as of the only begotten of the
[38:19] father full of grace and truth
[38:22] if you turn to Genesis 1 and verse 26
[38:25] . so we're going to go back to the
[38:26] beginning we're going to see because the
[38:28] Bible says in the beginning was the word
[38:29] in Genesis 1 26 and it said God said let
[38:32] us make man in our image after our
[38:35] likeness
[38:37] then we find in verse 27 so God created
[38:40] man in his own image in the image of God
[38:43] created he him male and female created
[38:47] he them
[38:48] and notice in verse 28 God blessed them
[38:51] and God said to them be fruitful and
[38:54] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[38:56] subdue it and have dominion over the
[38:58] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[39:00] air and over every living thing that
[39:02] moveth upon the Earth and invert in
[39:05] Genesis 2 and verse 7 before have you
[39:07] seated
[39:08] Genesis 2 and verse 7 and the Lord God
[39:10] formed man of the Dust of the ground and
[39:13] he breathed into his nostrils a breath
[39:15] of life and Man became a living Soul God
[39:19] bless you you can have your seats this
[39:20] evening
[39:23] so from our previous study we realized
[39:26] that man
[39:28] man was made last of all of God's
[39:31] creation
[39:32] God continued advancing his creation
[39:35] until he finally reached the Pinnacle of
[39:38] his creation Now how many have ever been
[39:40] to the mountains and you think wow how
[39:42] beautiful How Majestic how wonderful and
[39:45] you're just in awe of the creation of
[39:48] God and some of you ladies you probably
[39:50] feel that way about the beach but I
[39:52] don't feel that way about the beach but
[39:53] nevertheless you go places and you're in
[39:55] in in wonderment about how beautiful
[39:58] God's creation is and yet you are God's
[40:01] greatest form of creation you're the
[40:04] highest form of creation all the other
[40:06] creatures were created but notice none
[40:09] of the other creatures that were were
[40:10] created were ever created in the
[40:13] likeness of God Man was created in God's
[40:16] likeness in God's image and we find that
[40:19] man is the highest form of God's
[40:22] creation and then in Genesis 2 we find
[40:24] that God took of the Dust of the ground
[40:26] same thing he made all the other
[40:28] creation from and he made you that's
[40:30] here tonight of that creation so notice
[40:34] now that man that creative being he was
[40:37] made on the same day as all animal life
[40:41] but God just kept evolving in his
[40:43] creation because God had a thought in
[40:46] his mind that he wanted to have a family
[40:49] and you are part of that family but in
[40:51] order for God to have that family he had
[40:53] to First create something that was in
[40:56] His image he had to First create
[40:57] something that was in his likeness and
[41:00] the animal like did not match God in
[41:02] that aspect even though they were a
[41:04] creative being they did not have God's
[41:06] image God's formality and God's uh
[41:09] omnipotence everything that God was
[41:10] we're going to find tonight he poured
[41:13] that into his creation
[41:15] So Not only was God's pleased with his
[41:18] creation the Bible says now that he
[41:20] blessed them that word blessed I mean
[41:22] God stepped back and he adored his
[41:25] creation
[41:27] amen
[41:28] it means to adore God stepped back after
[41:31] he made all this that we're seeing
[41:33] tonight and all this the great
[41:35] atmospheres and the great mountains and
[41:37] in wonderful places and all the animal
[41:39] life those are in the sea those in the
[41:41] air those that are on the ground and yet
[41:43] when when God created man and he put man
[41:46] in his own image in his own light as God
[41:48] stepped back and God adored what he'd
[41:51] made and sometimes you wake up and you
[41:53] look in the mirror and you think my look
[41:55] at me I'm just a mess but I'm here to
[41:57] tell you tonight the Bible says you're
[41:59] fearfully and wonderfully made God is
[42:02] adoring his creation again tonight
[42:04] because now that creation that he once
[42:07] created is now just another part of
[42:09] God's continuing of what he did back
[42:12] then but now this creation discretion
[42:15] right here tonight that I'm speaking to
[42:16] tonight is not only Just In His Image
[42:19] but this creation tonight Bears his
[42:21] likeness because now in this hour his
[42:24] spirit is dwelling inside of his
[42:25] creature
[42:28] so we find he says now he stepped back
[42:30] and he blessed him
[42:33] I'll tell you sister Jessica you may
[42:35] have to sing tonight it's the season to
[42:37] be blessed
[42:38] well we're blessed tonight Church
[42:41] you may have a crummy day you may have
[42:43] been hitting everything it seems like
[42:45] the devil's throwing everything you can
[42:46] it's but I'm here to tell you your best
[42:48] because God has stepped back and he
[42:50] stepped and he's looking at you and
[42:52] wondering look at my pride look at my
[42:54] creation there was standing layout us
[42:56] here they're overcoming Satan in his own
[42:59] needing when the world is pushing for
[43:01] for the gay and lesbian agenda they're
[43:03] standing true women are women men are
[43:05] men they're serving me they're not just
[43:08] a denominational creature but they're
[43:09] True born-again Believer
[43:12] and God is adoring you tonight
[43:15] Church
[43:17] notice when he tells them now not only
[43:20] did he bless them
[43:21] but now he tells them be fruitful
[43:24] otherwise bring forth so we're speaking
[43:27] about the word we'll bring forth after
[43:30] his kind so be fruitful bring forth
[43:34] to increase to bear fruit
[43:37] you're not here just to sit on the
[43:38] church pew
[43:40] get out of here just to put money in an
[43:41] offering plea but you're here to be a
[43:45] replica replication of Christ himself of
[43:48] God himself notice he says and
[43:50] multiplying that word multiply there
[43:52] means to become many
[43:54] become numerous to make much
[43:57] to make many
[44:00] now some of us has tried that in our own
[44:02] natural families
[44:05] some of you blinds will get that
[44:07] tomorrow
[44:08] but it's too replenish to make to
[44:10] multiply and the word replenish there
[44:13] means to accomplish what I've set you
[44:15] out to do
[44:16] to replenish to accomplish to fulfill
[44:19] the commission that he's given you
[44:22] it's not to have a house full of kids
[44:23] even though the Bible says that your
[44:25] quiver is full and all that kind of
[44:27] stuff no but it's to bear fruit of his
[44:30] likeness
[44:33] so we call we would call from our last
[44:35] study that we spoke about that life
[44:37] comes from the sea all life no matter
[44:40] where it comes from it comes from the
[44:42] seed and life is in the sea and we find
[44:45] that the spoken word is that Original
[44:48] Seed so when you go to Genesis 1 you
[44:50] find God said God said God said God said
[44:54] and everywhere God said it manifested
[44:56] and manifested and manifested and when
[44:59] he said let us make man in our image I'm
[45:01] going to tell you it's manifesting once
[45:03] again
[45:06] now we find now we we find in Matthew 1
[45:09] we're going to kind of take our time and
[45:10] look at this tonight
[45:13] brother Timothy looked at my timer I
[45:15] said I'll stop early don't worry
[45:18] Matthew 1 we're going to find that Jesus
[45:20] is the word of God he was the one that
[45:23] was spoken of in the beginning
[45:26] but Eve did not wait to fulfill that
[45:31] portion of the word
[45:33] she jumped the gun or she received
[45:36] another seed instead of waiting to
[45:39] receive from Adam
[45:41] of the spoken word now we found here in
[45:43] Matthew 1 verse 18 says now the birth of
[45:45] Jesus Christ was on this wise when his
[45:48] mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[45:50] before they came together she was found
[45:53] with the child notice of the Holy Ghost
[45:57] so here we find let us make man in our
[46:00] image that was that was a decree that
[46:02] was made in Genesis
[46:04] but now we're jumping over into the New
[46:06] Testament the very first chapters of the
[46:08] New Testament and Joseph her husband
[46:10] being a just man and not willing to make
[46:12] her a public example he was minded to
[46:15] put her away probably but while he
[46:17] thought on these things behold the angel
[46:20] of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream
[46:22] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not
[46:26] to take unto thee Mary thou wife for
[46:28] that which is conceived in her is of the
[46:31] Holy Ghost
[46:34] so God had already spoke a word and that
[46:37] word was now about to materialize and
[46:40] bring forth what he should have brought
[46:42] forth in Genesis
[46:44] and she shall bring forth the son and
[46:47] thou shall call his name Jesus for he
[46:49] shall save the people from their sins
[46:50] verse 22. now all this was done that it
[46:53] might be fulfilled notice which was
[46:55] spoken of the Lord
[46:58] by the prophet so God already spoke to
[47:00] us
[47:01] and though yet we find that he's
[47:03] representing Isaiah Behold a virgin
[47:06] shall be with child and shall bring
[47:08] forth the son and they shall call his
[47:10] name Emmanuel which shall be interpreted
[47:12] God With Us
[47:16] first John 1 and verse 1.
[47:19] that which was from the beginning
[47:21] Genesis 1. which we have heard which we
[47:24] have seen with our eyes which we have
[47:26] looked upon and our hands have handled
[47:29] of the word of life
[47:31] for the life was manifested and we have
[47:34] seen it and we bear witness and we show
[47:36] unto you that that eternal life which
[47:39] was with the father and was manifested
[47:41] unto us that which we have seen and
[47:44] heard and declared we unto you that you
[47:46] also may have fellowship with us and
[47:49] truly our fellowship is with the father
[47:50] and with his son Jesus Christ so Jesus
[47:54] is the word that was made manifest
[47:59] he is the word he and the word are one
[48:02] they are the same that seed that was
[48:04] spoken in the beginning was now about to
[48:07] be manifested are we fine in Matthew 1
[48:09] that was manifested in Jesus and brother
[48:11] Brandon would tell us in the message of
[48:13] spoken word is the Original Seed he was
[48:16] that seed that Eve should have produced
[48:20] he was that Offspring now bear in mind c
[48:23] means Offspring descendant it means
[48:25] children so he was at Offspring or that
[48:28] seed that Eve should have produced he
[48:32] was at seed but she hybrid it by
[48:34] disbelieving the word of God
[48:37] see he was that seeding the only way
[48:40] that life could be in the reproduction
[48:42] of life life had to come through the
[48:45] seed and that seed had to die in order
[48:48] to spread out life and that's why the
[48:50] water was given the water to water the
[48:52] seed he said now the holy spirit that
[48:55] was in the Garden of Eden was to water
[48:57] the seed
[49:00] but that seed never came forth in the
[49:02] Garden of Eden in aspect of Jesus Christ
[49:06] now in the message the spoken words
[49:09] original CD said man was not made to die
[49:12] but yet every day you wake up with a new
[49:14] element
[49:16] you wake up with a new sickness a new
[49:18] report from the doctor you wake up with
[49:21] spots on the brain or you wake up with
[49:23] this and that or you have a child and
[49:25] that child has disaffliction and that
[49:27] Affliction and disaffliction but see man
[49:29] in the beginning was not made to die man
[49:32] was made to live but High breeding Eve
[49:34] because she took in another seed she
[49:37] received the LIE of the enemy wanted to
[49:39] do it cost you or it caused you to have
[49:42] all your heartache
[49:43] it's cause you to have all your pain all
[49:46] your aches all your ailments all your
[49:48] the sirens everything that you hear
[49:49] every hospital every doctor everything
[49:51] that was done was done because he did
[49:54] not wait to fulfill the promised word of
[49:57] God which she would had he should have
[49:59] just carried a little longer
[50:02] so brother man will tell us now Jesus is
[50:04] the word may manifest he in the word is
[50:06] one and the same and that's why it was
[50:09] so to be made manifest in him so
[50:12] perfectly that's the reason that God
[50:14] manifested himself so perfectly in Jesus
[50:17] because he was the seed word The Germ
[50:21] word itself The Germ that's inside the
[50:24] seed the life that's inside the seed and
[50:26] that word germ when the prophet of God
[50:28] speaks of that word he's speaking about
[50:30] the life
[50:32] so this is they're they're one of the
[50:34] same germ means life and every seed has
[50:37] a germ in it or it has life in it and
[50:39] whatever you water that seed with
[50:41] whatever's on the inside the light that
[50:43] lays on the inside of that sea will
[50:46] manifest itself
[50:50] so he says now and Jesus had to be
[50:53] broken up there in order for that seed
[50:56] to let forth of its life to order all
[50:59] the other seas that were coming
[51:01] oh man what a beautiful revelation
[51:04] that seed
[51:06] so it necessarily couldn't come in that
[51:08] hour and that moment in Genesis it had
[51:10] to wait for this hour or and when Jesus
[51:13] came and was manifested but that seed
[51:15] couldn't stay alive it had to be broken
[51:17] and so that it could water all the other
[51:19] seas that were coming and the prophet of
[51:21] God will say I'm sending forth the
[51:23] spirit to water it and it will produce
[51:25] just exactly it'll produce Miracles
[51:28] it'll produce the power of God it will
[51:30] produce and it will deny anything or it
[51:33] will not deny anything because it's
[51:35] Kindred with the seed so that's why you
[51:38] can't disbelieve the word because
[51:40] there's a life on the inside of you that
[51:42] will not allow you to disbelieve the
[51:44] word when you hear the word and receive
[51:46] the word you become the word because
[51:48] what the quickening power of the spirit
[51:51] the water it is quickening the seed on
[51:53] the inside and what does it do it it's
[51:55] bringing it forth to life what's already
[51:56] laid inside of you I say Oh Glory to God
[51:59] some of you didn't know that you were C
[52:01] but God came by your way anyway and he
[52:03] broke it open and watered that sea with
[52:05] the one words of life
[52:09] notice now all that God was
[52:12] he pours himself into Christ
[52:14] he emptied himself he kenosed himself
[52:17] into Christ but it didn't stop there
[52:20] because God said I'm going to bring
[52:22] forth
[52:24] replenish multiply replenish the Earth
[52:27] and he said that all that Christ was he
[52:30] emptied himself into his bride I said oh
[52:32] come on little brother what is it it
[52:34] ain't Mama and Daddy's religion you have
[52:37] been quickened for this hour you were
[52:38] seen from the beginning and what you're
[52:40] doing now is only manifesting what you
[52:43] are there
[52:43] [Applause]
[52:48] so though Adam and Eve fell in the
[52:51] beginning and it brought forth death
[52:54] the word had already been spoken
[52:59] let us
[53:01] for they'll make man in our image
[53:04] and God had already blessed it
[53:10] so I don't care what you're going
[53:11] through tonight you're already blessed
[53:14] he's already blessed it well I don't
[53:16] feel like it brother just beside the
[53:18] point the spoken word has already been
[53:20] blessed by almighty God
[53:23] notice now the word that has been spoken
[53:26] it spoke of your coming and you've
[53:28] already been blessed and there's nothing
[53:30] that the devil can do to stop that word
[53:33] from manifesting it may try you with
[53:35] cancer but cancer don't have enough it
[53:37] may try you with Affliction it may try
[53:39] your children it may try your own
[53:41] physical body it may try your finest but
[53:44] I'm here to tell you tonight Satan don't
[53:46] have enough because why the word has
[53:48] already been spoke over your life and
[53:49] what is he doing is quickening to life
[53:51] that's on the inside of the seed and
[53:54] that see God declared will bring forth
[53:57] in his act in its season after his kind
[54:02] God in the beginning blessed his
[54:04] creation and he commissioned his
[54:06] creation to replenish
[54:08] to fulfill my word
[54:14] he's commissioning them to bring forth
[54:17] just
[54:18] like they are
[54:20] because they're in His image in his
[54:22] likeness in his similarity therefore we
[54:25] are to bring forth more Sons and
[54:28] Daughters of God by the spoken word
[54:33] so we find that Jesus was the seed that
[54:36] Eve should have produced but she
[54:38] listened to the LIE
[54:40] and anytime you listen to the LIE
[54:43] complex
[54:44] doubt depression unbelief fear anxiety
[54:49] worry
[54:50] worthlessness anytime you listen to
[54:53] those things you will never produce them
[54:55] for the life that's laying on the inside
[54:57] of you but when you can look away from
[54:59] all those things you can look away and
[55:02] push away Satan's lives and receive what
[55:04] the word says that in there you've been
[55:07] made in my image in my likeness in my
[55:09] similar to you're going to be just like
[55:11] me and when you can receive that word
[55:13] then from your innermost beings whether
[55:16] you know it or not you begin to
[55:17] materialize and you're from your
[55:19] innermost being you begin to become that
[55:22] word
[55:24] come on church amen a little bit louder
[55:26] than that what am I telling you tonight
[55:28] when you respond to the word and I'm not
[55:30] trying to work him get you to respond
[55:32] but I'm telling you when you respond to
[55:33] the word with your amen so be it God
[55:36] that's the word for me they're from the
[55:38] inside it takes through and something
[55:40] begins to break apart all the unbelief
[55:43] breaks the part off your life it breaks
[55:45] apart off that Sea and the life that's
[55:47] laying in the sea but comes to manifest
[55:49] and then you believe the word and then
[55:52] you believe for healing and then you
[55:53] believe the super nice and then you
[55:55] believe the power of God and then you
[55:57] can believe for your lost loved ones I
[55:59] say Oh Glory to God tonight Lord I
[56:02] believe tonight help thou my unbelief
[56:05] [Applause]
[56:09] notice now there was a germ of life that
[56:11] come from the real seed he says
[56:14] but God proved that it was his see
[56:16] because he rose them up again
[56:20] that through that life
[56:22] that's going over the original seat like
[56:25] was given to Eve over his real church is
[56:29] bringing forth life again
[56:33] you're not bringing forth Tim Pruitt's
[56:35] life
[56:36] though we sit under a great ministry
[56:38] he's not wanting a bunch of CopyCat Tim
[56:41] Pruitts or Timothy Pruitts or Aaron
[56:43] oglesby's no he's willing to bring forth
[56:45] of his own self
[56:47] God has a desire to have a family and
[56:50] some of those families are short some of
[56:53] them are tall some are big some of them
[56:55] are skinny we're a bouquet of different
[56:57] types but nevertheless we're of his kind
[56:59] not personality followers but we're the
[57:02] follower of the word of God and I say
[57:04] let that word oh God be it down to me
[57:06] according to your word you want a son in
[57:09] this hour I'll be your son you want a
[57:12] daughter in this out I'll be your
[57:13] daughter I will let the word have its
[57:16] way in my life
[57:17] [Applause]
[57:18] you want to move Lord move through me
[57:20] tonight don't let me hinder the movement
[57:22] of the spirit don't let me push down and
[57:25] stop the flowing of the water coming
[57:27] across the sea it may not be your night
[57:29] but it may be somebody else don't let
[57:31] You Hinder the water flowing up that
[57:33] predestinated seed
[57:38] we have some people they just if it
[57:40] ain't about them they just shut down
[57:44] it may not be about you tonight
[57:46] but don't shut down credit atmosphere
[57:49] so that seeds
[57:51] can be manifested
[57:55] there's times we preach we pour our
[57:57] hearts out we go to the back and we
[57:59] think well that was a flop
[58:02] these brothers will tell you amen they
[58:03] ain't doing it right now
[58:05] but they'll tell you
[58:06] sometimes you just feel like wow that
[58:08] just whoops
[58:10] but what you find somebody come up to
[58:13] you later that's exactly what I needed
[58:16] that helped me so much
[58:18] because it wasn't for everybody it was
[58:21] maybe for one or two or three or four
[58:24] but it was God's word in God's season it
[58:28] fell on good ground
[58:30] and now we finally begins to produce
[58:33] what was already inside of it oh
[58:37] so the germ is the life now notice now
[58:40] I'm gonna get into some stuff tonight
[58:41] and I'm gonna do my best to contain
[58:44] myself
[58:45] to my wife Hi man I've been up shut up
[58:47] you know all but day to day and tell you
[58:49] what it was getting rich up there I had
[58:50] to finally stop say look you can't go no
[58:52] path no further than this stop right
[58:54] here
[58:55] I'd be hey we'll be here three hours a
[58:58] night or more but we ain't gonna do that
[58:59] so let's just move forward
[59:02] let's move forward yeah
[59:06] just
[59:07] let's look in Colossians 1 and verse 12.
[59:10] notice now Jesus
[59:12] is the beginning of the creation of God
[59:18] I'm going to show you something tonight
[59:20] Jesus is the firstborn
[59:24] he's a firstborn and he's also the
[59:27] beginning so we're going to go through
[59:28] some scriptures Colossians 1 and verse
[59:30] 12 we'll start there giving thanks unto
[59:32] the Father which has made us meet to be
[59:35] partakers of his inheritance of the
[59:37] Saints in light
[59:39] who had delivered us from the power of
[59:41] darkness and everybody here tonight
[59:42] should be able to say Amen to that
[59:44] I've been delivered from the power of
[59:47] darkness and he's translated us
[59:49] into the kingdom of his dear son
[59:53] now his son Jesus hold on to that
[59:57] and whom we have Redemption through his
[59:59] blood even the Forgiveness of sins
[1:00:01] notice verse 15 who is the image of the
[1:00:05] invisible God the firstborn of every
[1:00:08] creature you didn't know what God looked
[1:00:11] like until Jesus walked the shores you
[1:00:13] didn't know what God was until he came
[1:00:15] in a Manger you we didn't know what God
[1:00:17] we didn't we couldn't fathom God all his
[1:00:21] greatness all his glory and yet he came
[1:00:23] down and he took on the form of man and
[1:00:26] many did not believe because why God was
[1:00:28] so magnificent God was so awe-inspired
[1:00:31] and yet God created a vessel and he came
[1:00:34] and dropped down to live in that vessel
[1:00:36] then when that vessel was here that
[1:00:37] vessel declared to you the invisible God
[1:00:40] was now made visible and he was the
[1:00:42] beginning of the creation of God
[1:00:47] notice for
[1:00:49] for by him were all things created that
[1:00:52] are in heaven that are in the earth
[1:00:54] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:00:56] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[1:00:58] or Powers all things were created by Him
[1:01:01] and for him and he is before all things
[1:01:03] and by him all things consist everything
[1:01:07] we do whether it be word or deed we do
[1:01:09] it in Jesus Christ
[1:01:12] because that is the name of God
[1:01:15] so now verse 18.
[1:01:19] he is the head of the body the church
[1:01:22] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:01:25] the dead notice he's the firstborn from
[1:01:28] the dead
[1:01:29] so let's jump to John 11 verse 25.
[1:01:33] Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:01:36] resurrection and the life
[1:01:38] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:01:40] dead yet shall he live so he's declared
[1:01:44] I'm the firstborn from the dead but if
[1:01:47] you believe in me though you were dead
[1:01:49] yet you shall live whosoever live with
[1:01:52] them believeth in me shall never die
[1:01:54] Acts 26 and verse 23.
[1:01:57] that Christ should suffer and that he
[1:02:00] should be the first that should rise
[1:02:03] from the dead and should show light unto
[1:02:05] the people and into the Gentiles notice
[1:02:08] the first to rise from the dead
[1:02:13] First Corinthians 15 and verse 20.
[1:02:16] but now is Christ risen from the dead
[1:02:19] and he has become the first fruits of
[1:02:22] them that sleep
[1:02:24] for Since By Man Came Death that's
[1:02:27] through Adam by a man came also the
[1:02:29] resurrection of the dead that's through
[1:02:31] the second Adam
[1:02:33] for as Adam all die even so in Christ
[1:02:36] shall all be alive
[1:02:38] so we finally we go back and we look at
[1:02:41] this and the Bible tells us that he's
[1:02:43] the first fruit for all them that slept
[1:02:45] so all down since Adam's time until
[1:02:47] Jesus time they all set they all died
[1:02:50] and they should have all been made in
[1:02:52] the image of Christ but what happened
[1:02:54] Eve hybrid and she brought death upon
[1:02:57] Adam's race or to the human race and now
[1:02:59] every man that was born he had to go by
[1:03:02] the way of the great he had to die but
[1:03:04] when this man came he wasn't born of a
[1:03:07] man he was born of the Holy Ghost he was
[1:03:09] birthed by almighty God he was the
[1:03:11] firstborn of many many brothers he was
[1:03:14] the first and he is the beginning of the
[1:03:16] creation of God and I'm here to tell you
[1:03:18] tonight when he rose again he made a way
[1:03:21] for you not to die
[1:03:24] he made a way for you to Break Every
[1:03:26] curse of sin and he broke it off of you
[1:03:29] so that the adamic race that would that
[1:03:31] curse that was on Adam and on his on his
[1:03:33] kind then was broken off of the second
[1:03:35] Adam and of his kind and now what he was
[1:03:38] we are I say Oh Glory to God tonight all
[1:03:41] that God was I am
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:47] let me slow down a little bit I'm
[1:03:48] getting excited I apologize
[1:03:55] so we find here Revelations 1 and verse
[1:03:57] 18.
[1:03:59] I am heed that liveth and was dead and
[1:04:03] behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and I
[1:04:06] had the keys of hell and of death
[1:04:09] Revelations 3 and 14 this is to our age
[1:04:13] and unto the angel of the Church of the
[1:04:15] laodiceans right
[1:04:17] these things say at the amen the
[1:04:19] faithful and the true witness the
[1:04:21] beginning of the creation of God
[1:04:25] but bro Brown tells us and wine had to
[1:04:28] be shepherd He said he started a new
[1:04:31] creation
[1:04:33] he Jesus started a new creation what was
[1:04:37] it a creation of himself God was made
[1:04:40] flesh and dwelt Among Us was God he said
[1:04:43] God was created in human form in Jesus
[1:04:46] Christ his son God dwelt he built his
[1:04:49] Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and he
[1:04:51] lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel
[1:04:53] God With Us he built himself a house to
[1:04:57] live in so that he can reflect his word
[1:04:59] to his subjects through that house
[1:05:04] he said you know what God is when you
[1:05:06] see Christ
[1:05:08] so the invisible God was now made
[1:05:11] visible
[1:05:13] and the Bible tells in first John 1 and
[1:05:15] 1 and that which was from the beginning
[1:05:16] which we have heard which we have seen
[1:05:18] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[1:05:20] with our hands and have handled of the
[1:05:22] word of life now
[1:05:24] that invisible God
[1:05:26] is made visible again today
[1:05:28] not in a one-man Ministry
[1:05:30] but not in a multi-member body
[1:05:33] because it's a continuation of the
[1:05:35] creation of God because he's bringing
[1:05:38] forth of his kind
[1:05:41] oh my
[1:05:42] God oh my notice what he says in
[1:05:44] laodicean church a how could God be
[1:05:47] creative if he's a spirit and you're
[1:05:49] probably wondering that tonight how
[1:05:51] could God be creative he's the spirit
[1:05:52] how could that be he's Eternal he never
[1:05:55] was created excuse me he never will be
[1:05:59] created because he was God at the
[1:06:01] beginning but see in the beginning of
[1:06:03] the creation of God was Jesus Christ
[1:06:05] when he was made manifest when God lived
[1:06:09] in him so he became the beginning of the
[1:06:11] creation of God when he made Jesus and
[1:06:14] when he came and lived inside of that
[1:06:16] vessel then he became
[1:06:19] the beginning of a new creation
[1:06:22] Church we're not of the old creation
[1:06:24] we're the new creation
[1:06:28] so notice see he is God's creation oh my
[1:06:32] the first and the last the amen the
[1:06:34] beginning of the creation of God when
[1:06:36] God created himself a body he come down
[1:06:39] and lived in it that's the beginning of
[1:06:41] the creation of God
[1:06:43] I say God live in this body
[1:06:46] God live in this body God come and live
[1:06:48] in me tonight let my life be a
[1:06:51] continuation of that same life that same
[1:06:54] spirit that same anointing that same
[1:06:56] word let it continue to flow forth in
[1:06:58] this hour though it may be a dark hour
[1:07:00] dark an hour of apostasy but yet God let
[1:07:04] that life come and live inside of me and
[1:07:06] may it manifest not of the old adamic
[1:07:08] race but of the new creation of that new
[1:07:11] race of that super church or that super
[1:07:13] race God let the word be formed in me
[1:07:15] that I can be a display of your
[1:07:17] character
[1:07:20] he says now the Holy Blood that was
[1:07:23] created by God the blood the life the
[1:07:26] creation of God Jesus was the beginning
[1:07:28] of the creation of God you see God made
[1:07:32] in creation he was the spirit the Bible
[1:07:35] says he's the beginning of the creation
[1:07:36] of God how did he begin in the womb of a
[1:07:40] woman
[1:07:41] notice Mary's response to the angel
[1:07:44] be it unto me and when you come to
[1:07:47] church
[1:07:48] that should be your response to the
[1:07:50] angel
[1:07:51] to the one that's ministering to you to
[1:07:53] the presence of God it's not a time to
[1:07:56] block it and shut it back and I don't
[1:07:58] feel good or preaching me happy no it's
[1:08:00] be it unto me Lord be it unto me let
[1:08:03] that word Lord though I may not
[1:08:04] understand it let it Quicken the sea let
[1:08:07] it come across my path or don't let me
[1:08:09] get worried about the music and how loud
[1:08:11] the speakers are and how bad this one
[1:08:13] smells or or this one does this God let
[1:08:16] it be unto me according to Thy word let
[1:08:19] Thy word be formed to me he said that
[1:08:21] was the seed The Original Seed when he
[1:08:24] or when Mary said be it unto me he said
[1:08:27] that was when the seed came I said Oh
[1:08:29] Glory to God if the right attitude
[1:08:31] toward the promise of God will revealed
[1:08:34] seed then it's going to manifest seed
[1:08:36] now so you might as well say God be it
[1:08:38] unto me tonight let the word be formed
[1:08:40] to me tonight let it come forth from me
[1:08:42] tonight God that'll be the same see the
[1:08:45] same Faith a same power a same anointing
[1:08:48] Lord
[1:08:48] be it unto me tonight
[1:08:54] God in his spirit
[1:08:56] notice he's a spirit
[1:08:58] so he couldn't be created but he created
[1:09:00] a body
[1:09:03] he's got bodies here tonight
[1:09:05] he created a body that he could live in
[1:09:10] notice and in that body
[1:09:12] he ate in that body
[1:09:15] he slept in that body
[1:09:18] he talked through that body
[1:09:20] he walked in that body he healed in that
[1:09:24] body he preached in that body he
[1:09:26] performed miracles in that body
[1:09:29] he cast out devils in that body he
[1:09:32] walked on water in that body he rose
[1:09:35] from the grave in that same body he
[1:09:39] ascended on high in that same body he
[1:09:42] was the beginning of the creation of God
[1:09:44] and if that was the beginning what about
[1:09:47] us now all that he was we are and if he
[1:09:51] could eat in that body if he could
[1:09:52] preach in that body if he could walk on
[1:09:54] water in that body if he could cast out
[1:09:56] devils in that body what about this body
[1:09:59] what about the manifesto cheese today
[1:10:01] we're going to bring forth the same
[1:10:03] results church I said Oh Glory to God
[1:10:06] tonight the same word the same anointing
[1:10:08] the same power a same gospel the same
[1:10:12] word
[1:10:13] because the same God
[1:10:17] oh my
[1:10:22] notice
[1:10:24] he was once God above them
[1:10:28] they didn't know what he looked like
[1:10:30] and he became god with them
[1:10:33] through the prophets
[1:10:36] but now
[1:10:37] in Christ in that new creation
[1:10:41] he became God in them
[1:10:43] that's why he's a new creation at the
[1:10:45] beginning of the new creation because
[1:10:48] now God was determined never before had
[1:10:51] God ever lived in his creation
[1:10:53] until Jesus
[1:10:55] and Jesus was the beginning he was the
[1:10:58] firstborn he was the wave offering that
[1:11:01] there's more to come there's going to be
[1:11:04] more seeds coming to life
[1:11:06] for once God was above him where once he
[1:11:10] just was with them but now it's the new
[1:11:12] creation and we're the continuation of
[1:11:15] that new creation because we're not here
[1:11:17] because of our own efforts we're here
[1:11:18] because the holy spirit is now
[1:11:20] Tabernacle in this hour in this age man
[1:11:23] again
[1:11:25] oh come on Church
[1:11:27] so what he was then he is now
[1:11:32] he is now
[1:11:34] he is now
[1:11:36] you may didn't feel like that this
[1:11:38] morning or you may have had a rough week
[1:11:40] but what he was then he is now
[1:11:44] says Loretta he is now
[1:11:47] what he was
[1:11:49] the same power
[1:11:51] same Authority
[1:11:52] is what he is now same power
[1:11:56] same Authority who has more Authority in
[1:11:59] heaven a sinner saved by grace or an
[1:12:01] angel he said a sinner that's been saved
[1:12:03] by grace
[1:12:05] has more Authority in heaven than the
[1:12:07] angel who never sinned think about what
[1:12:10] God has thought of you because not only
[1:12:12] were you just a sinner God doesn't see
[1:12:14] that aspect of it he sees the beginning
[1:12:16] or he sees a continuation of the
[1:12:19] creation
[1:12:20] man in my likeness
[1:12:22] in my image
[1:12:24] see all that God did in that body
[1:12:27] as the beginning of the creation of God
[1:12:29] we are to continue
[1:12:31] that's why we don't preach another
[1:12:33] gospel then what Paul preached we preach
[1:12:34] the same thing Paul priests
[1:12:36] we preach the same thing all the
[1:12:38] prophets preach because it's the same
[1:12:40] word we don't deviate off of it we stay
[1:12:42] right with it the Bible tells us that
[1:12:44] Colossians 1 and verse 26 even the
[1:12:47] mystery which had been hid from the ages
[1:12:49] and from Generations but now is made
[1:12:52] manifest in his Saints notice it used to
[1:12:55] be a mystery where God was who God was
[1:12:57] but now we find in verse 27 to whom God
[1:13:01] will make known what is the riches of
[1:13:03] his glory of this mystery among the
[1:13:06] Gentiles which is Christ in you
[1:13:10] come on Christ

[1:13:15] this evening but I'm here to tell you
[1:13:16] your Christ this evening you're the same
[1:13:18] creation you're being birthed by
[1:13:20] almighty God you couldn't stay your sin

[1:13:25] already spoke a word over your life let
[1:13:28] me just tell some of your moms and dads
[1:13:30] Satan can't keep your kids but because
[1:13:32] he's got a word and starting to be spoke
[1:13:34] over it that they had their offspring
[1:13:36] they shall be there I say back up devil
[1:13:39] take your hands off of God's Property
[1:13:42] tonight we got a word and that word will
[1:13:45] bring forth
[1:13:47] hello glory to God tonight the word
[1:13:49] cannot return void but it will
[1:13:52] accomplish it will manifest it will
[1:13:55] produce of its kind I say feel unto me
[1:13:58] tonight father let me be of that kind
[1:14:00] that may be of that same spirit
[1:14:03] [Applause]
[1:14:07] whoo
[1:14:09] what was once a mystery
[1:14:12] is now a manifest
[1:14:17] what was once a mystery
[1:14:19] has now been made manifest
[1:14:21] in the prize
[1:14:25] Pride notice
[1:14:27] a little seeing Church age
[1:14:30] my mama
[1:14:32] he says to show that he was the first
[1:14:35] he was the beginning of the creation of
[1:14:37] God oh do you catch it
[1:14:41] how
[1:14:42] could God be creative he's a spirit how
[1:14:45] could he be
[1:14:47] he's eternal
[1:14:48] he never was created he never will be
[1:14:52] created because he was God at the
[1:14:55] beginning
[1:14:56] but he that is the beginning of the
[1:14:59] creation of God was Jesus Christ when he
[1:15:02] was made manifest when God lived in him
[1:15:05] he is God's creation
[1:15:08] only the beginning
[1:15:11] oh my
[1:15:12] only the beginning the first and the
[1:15:15] last the amen the beginning of the
[1:15:17] creation of God when God created himself
[1:15:20] a body he came down and lived in that
[1:15:22] that's the beginning of the creation of
[1:15:25] God he says oh isn't that wonderful
[1:15:27] and now we find he showed his deity
[1:15:30] right there on the Almighty I am he that
[1:15:34] was which he is and which shall come be
[1:15:36] Almighty to the church at Ephesus said
[1:15:39] it three times is that right comes right
[1:15:41] on over to the laoda sin and said I am
[1:15:43] the amen I was the first back there I am
[1:15:47] the last over here I am the beginning of
[1:15:49] the creation of God that through the
[1:15:51] church ages they were to have you'll
[1:15:54] learn that I am God God created man in
[1:15:56] form and I am the beginning of the
[1:15:59] creation of God
[1:16:01] only the beginning
[1:16:03] he had Seven Ages
[1:16:06] to manifest himself
[1:16:09] he manifested himself down through Seven
[1:16:12] Ages
[1:16:13] and now we're here well the Omega God
[1:16:17] or the alpha God is now the Omega
[1:16:21] he said one of the same the beginning
[1:16:22] and the ending he says you see what I
[1:16:25] mean he said it is the germ that come
[1:16:27] from the sea he is the word of God made
[1:16:30] perfectly manifest he is correctly the
[1:16:33] son from the first Adam was the son that
[1:16:36] was promised through Adam to continue on
[1:16:39] the human race
[1:16:42] and so what you are tonight is the
[1:16:44] continuation
[1:16:46] of that Genesis promise
[1:16:49] knows everything that Adam lost Jesus
[1:16:53] was
[1:16:55] oh
[1:16:56] what did Adam lose
[1:16:58] Adam lost in Eternal rain
[1:17:02] Adam could speak and things would move
[1:17:06] come on are you with me tonight
[1:17:08] sometimes we wish we could speak things
[1:17:10] and they move
[1:17:12] but I'll tell you we're getting back to
[1:17:13] a place church when we can speak not
[1:17:16] just of our own willy-nilly self but we
[1:17:18] can speak under the unction of the Holy
[1:17:20] Spirit and you can see things move you
[1:17:23] can speak to that devil and he's got to
[1:17:25] take his hands off you can speak to that
[1:17:27] life and that life has to go by because
[1:17:29] we are back on speaking terms with the
[1:17:32] father because what it is no longer the
[1:17:34] Adam race coming down but now hit the
[1:17:36] beginning has now flowed down through
[1:17:38] seven churches and we are the
[1:17:40] culmination of all of it I say Oh Glory
[1:17:43] to God tonight we are the finality we
[1:17:46] are the final voice to the final days we
[1:17:49] are the mouthpiece of almighty God if he
[1:17:52] is ever going to come he's going to come
[1:17:54] through you he's got to come through us
[1:17:56] tonight I say feel I'm coming on
[1:17:59] according to your word
[1:18:01] Hallelujah
[1:18:05] let that word be formed in me
[1:18:12] he says you can't be seed now
[1:18:17] can we spin that clock back about 30
[1:18:19] minutes
[1:18:20] Mercy
[1:18:21] he says he you can't be seized and
[1:18:24] disagree with the word
[1:18:28] did you hear that
[1:18:30] you can't be seized and disagree with
[1:18:33] the word
[1:18:34] because the word is the seed
[1:18:39] and if you are the word how can you
[1:18:42] disagree with it you'd be disagreeing
[1:18:44] with yourself
[1:18:46] and we ain't split personality
[1:18:50] we ain't uh bipolar people
[1:18:53] oh God don't create bipolar people
[1:18:56] we know he don't create split
[1:18:57] personalities no we believe the word we
[1:19:01] stay with the word and the nature of our
[1:19:04] parents how many have ever heard we've
[1:19:05] talked about it the family strain that
[1:19:07] follows a family
[1:19:09] now I got a young son over here
[1:19:12] and I got a young daughter right here
[1:19:14] and she goes off to Ohio last year they
[1:19:17] said we're going to call up Little Joe
[1:19:19] Adams
[1:19:22] so why'd they call Little Joe she don't
[1:19:24] look like me she's beautiful
[1:19:26] pretty hair talented plays the panel
[1:19:29] really well
[1:19:31] but what is it there's something that
[1:19:34] was deposited in her she didn't question
[1:19:36] it she had no she couldn't stop it she
[1:19:39] couldn't hinder it she had nothing to do
[1:19:41] with it but it manifested itself out
[1:19:44] but it was the nature of her father and
[1:19:48] what am I telling you tonight you didn't
[1:19:50] ask for it but he was there anyway he
[1:19:52] deposited anyway and in the right time
[1:19:54] in the right moment it begins to
[1:19:57] manifest what's manifesting the
[1:19:59] attributes of the Father the attributes
[1:20:02] of the word has been taken that's why
[1:20:05] you say Amen to the work that's why you
[1:20:08] can dance that's why you can shout
[1:20:10] that's why you get straight that's why
[1:20:12] you can Rejoice wow because the
[1:20:15] attributes of the father is manifesting
[1:20:18] itself
[1:20:21] they want to tell you we don't have to
[1:20:23] get emotional I can't help it I am what
[1:20:26] I am because the father's nature is
[1:20:29] manifesting through me
[1:20:31] and if you had my father you may do the
[1:20:34] same
[1:20:38] see we take to Nature
[1:20:40] nature of our parents the attribute
[1:20:45] begins to flow out
[1:20:47] now as we go on a few more services down
[1:20:50] if I had the opportunity to speak to you
[1:20:52] I want to speak to your manifested sons
[1:20:55] that's part five
[1:20:59] somewhere around there yeah I don't work
[1:21:01] myself way out there in the future
[1:21:05] his full time is great
[1:21:07] study study study but we fine
[1:21:11] see brother Brown says you can't make
[1:21:13] yourself anything different
[1:21:15] than what God intended you to be
[1:21:19] come on somebody needs to tell their
[1:21:21] complex I can't make myself nothing but
[1:21:24] what God intended me to be
[1:21:30] see anything else is an impersonation
[1:21:32] therefore if your conversion is only
[1:21:34] because you're trying to hide behind
[1:21:37] something or trying to make yourself a
[1:21:39] better person you're only playing the
[1:21:41] part of a hypocrite
[1:21:43] so you can't make yourself bride
[1:21:46] you're not bribed by your choosing but
[1:21:49] you're bribed by God's choose
[1:21:52] of cockle bar can only be a cocoa bar
[1:21:58] you you can hybrid it you can mix it but
[1:22:02] in the end it's gonna only be a cocoa
[1:22:05] butter
[1:22:06] and as much as I like to be tall
[1:22:08] dark
[1:22:10] handsome I'll never be that
[1:22:13] y'all supposed to laugh right there
[1:22:17] as much as I would love to be a great
[1:22:20] singer
[1:22:21] and the spirit of God just come flooding
[1:22:23] down
[1:22:26] and bathe over the people that gift is
[1:22:28] not in me
[1:22:30] I'm not going to get up you do huh I'm
[1:22:32] not gonna get up here and try to
[1:22:33] manufacture that and impersonate that
[1:22:36] we'll all be plugging our ears tonight
[1:22:39] for see I can only be what God's
[1:22:42] deposited in me
[1:22:44] seeing if that life is in you you can't
[1:22:47] manifest nothing but that life he said
[1:22:50] well brother Joe then why do some people
[1:22:51] take a long time why is it 40 years 50
[1:22:54] years 90 years because of Son of God a
[1:22:57] seed can lay dormant for a long time but
[1:22:59] it doesn't mean that the sea will never
[1:23:01] deposited the sea was always deposited
[1:23:04] it was put there before the foundation
[1:23:06] of the world when before God's blew out
[1:23:09] the planets off of his head God planted
[1:23:11] that seed inside of you you were a
[1:23:13] thought of God there and then
[1:23:18] so he says here now
[1:23:21] notice we're not bastard-born children
[1:23:24] I want you to get that tonight you may
[1:23:26] feel like that sometimes but you're not
[1:23:27] bastard-born children a meal can never
[1:23:30] breed itself back to a horse
[1:23:33] can never breed himself back to a donkey
[1:23:36] but a meal will always be a mule he's
[1:23:38] gonna die and he'll never produce
[1:23:41] Offspring what am I telling you you'll
[1:23:43] never be a denominational believer
[1:23:45] because that seed ain't inside of you
[1:23:48] what's on the inside is the word see and
[1:23:52] from that word when it comes in contact
[1:23:54] with that word with the spirit of God
[1:23:57] and the spirit of God brings you and
[1:23:59] quickens that see it will manifest of
[1:24:01] its kind
[1:24:06] we're genuine wine Sons
[1:24:09] and daughters
[1:24:11] of God
[1:24:14] let me get somewhere where I can bring
[1:24:15] this start bringing this down
[1:24:18] all right
[1:24:21] he said all of God's Sons
[1:24:24] must be the same
[1:24:27] to be born of the word and spirit brings
[1:24:31] us back to the spoken word again like in
[1:24:35] John 3.
[1:24:37] to be born of the water and of the
[1:24:39] spirit what does it do then it brings
[1:24:41] you right back again unto the place
[1:24:44] where you should have been at the
[1:24:46] beginning
[1:24:48] see that's the reason of Christ's death
[1:24:51] it brings us right back again to sons of
[1:24:54] God and he said eve would have brought
[1:24:56] forth that child she would have finally
[1:24:59] done it did not God tell her multiply
[1:25:01] and replenish the Earth
[1:25:04] now I'm going to go here for a few more
[1:25:06] minutes
[1:25:09] all right
[1:25:11] I'm gonna tap on this I tapped on it
[1:25:13] last time and I didn't get to get where
[1:25:14] I wanted to go so just hold on tight
[1:25:16] will you hold on tight with me tonight
[1:25:19] we file in Ephesians 1 Paul and the
[1:25:21] Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:25:22] God to the Saints which are at Ephesus
[1:25:25] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:25:27] Grace be unto you and peace from God our
[1:25:30] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:32] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:25:35] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[1:25:37] now that word bless their means that
[1:25:39] means he has prospered us
[1:25:42] it's a different word blessed than it
[1:25:44] was in Genesis now he's prospering that
[1:25:46] sea and he says now with all spiritual
[1:25:49] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:25:53] according as he had chosen Us in him
[1:25:57] before the foundation of the world that
[1:25:59] we should be holy Without Blame before
[1:26:00] him in love having predestinated us unto
[1:26:04] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:26:06] to himself according to the good
[1:26:08] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[1:26:10] his glory of his grace wherein he hath
[1:26:12] made us accepted in the Beloved
[1:26:16] now some of you are looking for
[1:26:18] acceptance there's your acceptance right
[1:26:19] there
[1:26:20] you looking for a click click up with
[1:26:22] that
[1:26:23] you look for somebody to fellowship with
[1:26:25] fellowship with that word right there he
[1:26:27] have made you accepted in the Beloved so
[1:26:30] notice we think well I chose God when I
[1:26:32] did this and it was such a bad thing and
[1:26:34] you know I chose God I I decided I was
[1:26:36] going to circle I know you didn't have
[1:26:37] anything to do with it God chose you he
[1:26:40] said we were chosen in him and that word
[1:26:42] chosen that means to pick out
[1:26:45] God picked you out now I was a fat kid
[1:26:48] when I grew up I was the last to be
[1:26:50] picked
[1:26:59] don't be laughing
[1:27:02] I was the last one I sit there like this
[1:27:04] you know how my self-esteem felt
[1:27:08] but this ain't the case with God
[1:27:11] God said I was chosen before the
[1:27:13] foundation of the world where was I
[1:27:15] chosen not on the volleyball court when
[1:27:17] I was the last one because I was short
[1:27:19] because I was stupid couldn't move and
[1:27:22] unathletic no I was chosen in God's mind
[1:27:25] but for the foundation of the world God
[1:27:28] chose me and him I said all glory to God
[1:27:31] and if God ever chose you tonight he
[1:27:33] cannot choose you you know sometimes you
[1:27:36] wish you could unchoose people
[1:27:38] cause they fall over themselves they
[1:27:40] stumble they missed the ball there I
[1:27:42] wish I would have never picked it but it
[1:27:43] ain't like that with God if God ever
[1:27:45] chose you he cannot choose you I said Oh
[1:27:47] Glory to God tonight God told you Church
[1:27:50] you were chosen in him before the
[1:27:53] foundation of the world
[1:27:57] he picked you out
[1:27:59] there's Millions out there that ain't
[1:28:01] sitting where you're sitting but God
[1:28:03] chose you to sit here God chose you to
[1:28:05] be a part of your family God told you to
[1:28:07] be a part of this church God chose you
[1:28:09] tonight hey God will not Choose You
[1:28:15] what did he choose in himself
[1:28:18] and what did he do
[1:28:20] predestinated us
[1:28:23] unto the adoption of children
[1:28:28] to bring forth
[1:28:30] predestination
[1:28:32] and I'm gonna go in this just for a
[1:28:33] minute hold on to your seat I may be a
[1:28:35] little past 8 30.
[1:28:37] notice now he says Smyrna Church days
[1:28:40] before there was ever a speck a stardust
[1:28:42] before God was God God is an object of
[1:28:45] adoration and no one was there to
[1:28:48] worship him so he was at that time only
[1:28:51] potentially God he was known only as the
[1:28:55] eternal spirit but the bride was already
[1:28:58] in his mind
[1:29:01] well I'm having a bad day but you was
[1:29:03] already in his mind well I don't feel
[1:29:06] like I'm saved but you was already in
[1:29:09] his mind well I'm going through a trial
[1:29:11] but you was already in his mind my
[1:29:15] finances are bad but you was already in
[1:29:18] his mind
[1:29:21] he said yes she was she was existing in
[1:29:25] his stuff and what about those thoughts
[1:29:27] of God he says they are Eternal are they
[1:29:31] not he had chosen Us in him Jesus but
[1:29:34] for the foundation of the world that
[1:29:36] means that right there with him in the
[1:29:39] mind and thoughts of God before the
[1:29:41] foundation of the world that gives an
[1:29:43] eternal quality to the elect
[1:29:47] and you can't get away from that
[1:29:50] now
[1:29:51] not everyone that is living every human
[1:29:54] that is living
[1:29:55] can fit that scripture
[1:29:58] it's only for the chosen it's only for
[1:30:02] those that were with Christ that was
[1:30:05] with the Lamb of for the foundation of
[1:30:07] her when he was slain it's only for
[1:30:09] those that was in the mind of God and
[1:30:10] the thoughts of God and when he was
[1:30:12] thinking of a family when God desired to
[1:30:16] have a family
[1:30:18] God put you there
[1:30:21] oh my
[1:30:23] you know when I never thought about
[1:30:25] having a family
[1:30:26] I never knew God would give me a
[1:30:28] beautiful wife
[1:30:30] and she is beautiful
[1:30:31] I didn't know he would give me three
[1:30:33] beautiful daughters and they are
[1:30:35] beautiful
[1:30:35] he that he would give me a handsome son
[1:30:38] I never imagined it but God did
[1:30:42] and when God needed certain qualities
[1:30:45] to be a part of that family God thought
[1:30:47] of you and God thought of you and God
[1:30:50] thought of you and God placed you there
[1:30:53] you were chosen in him there because
[1:30:55] there's something inside of you you may
[1:30:58] take a little bit different than
[1:30:59] somebody else but it fits God's family
[1:31:04] and God was determined that in this hour
[1:31:07] he's going to manifest the attributes of
[1:31:10] his family
[1:31:11] chosen in him predestinated Unto the
[1:31:15] Sons of God to the children of God
[1:31:18] that's why you're here tonight what
[1:31:21] you're doing here tonight you're
[1:31:22] expressing the quality
[1:31:25] that was in God's mind the word that was
[1:31:27] in God's mind you're here tonight
[1:31:29] expressing manifesting who God is
[1:31:33] my brother Brandon would go on the
[1:31:35] spoken word he says now who is it to
[1:31:37] everybody said no only to the faithful
[1:31:40] in Jesus Christ
[1:31:42] now to the faithful in Christ now he's
[1:31:44] talking to the church now this is not to
[1:31:46] the outside this is to the church
[1:31:47] according as he has chosen us did he did
[1:31:50] you did we choose him he says oh he says
[1:31:53] no you were according to the word you
[1:31:55] didn't Jesus said he never or you never
[1:31:58] chose me I chose you and yea he says
[1:32:01] when did he choose it when did Jesus say
[1:32:04] he chose his church before the
[1:32:06] foundation of the world according as he
[1:32:08] has chosen Us in him not at the last
[1:32:11] Revival that Dr so-and-so had no no he
[1:32:14] says you might read that in the Creed or
[1:32:16] in a textbook but not in this one
[1:32:18] according as he has chosen Us in him
[1:32:21] before the foundation of the world when
[1:32:23] we were chosen at the last Revival
[1:32:25] tonight we got saved he says he says now
[1:32:28] listen when there wasn't a world no he
[1:32:30] said it wasn't a star there was no atoms
[1:32:33] there was no molecules that's when we
[1:32:35] were chosen see before the foundation of
[1:32:37] the world not members we're not members
[1:32:40] we're born into the family of God God
[1:32:42] let me tell you church tonight he
[1:32:44] predestinated you to be there
[1:32:48] now that word predestination is a strong
[1:32:50] word and a lot of people push back on it
[1:32:52] and a lot of people fear it but I'm
[1:32:54] going to end here tonight with this
[1:32:55] right here he says notice now it's not
[1:32:57] the person that comes predestinated
[1:33:00] eternally from God it's the word or the
[1:33:02] seed that comes predestinated eternally
[1:33:05] from God
[1:33:06] it's not your physical body but it's the
[1:33:08] seed that was deposited inside of that
[1:33:11] body but for the foundation of the world
[1:33:13] that comes predestinated
[1:33:16] I said well Joe I got to have some
[1:33:17] scripture thank you I'll give it to you
[1:33:19] Romans 8 verse 27.
[1:33:21] and he that searches the hearts knoweth
[1:33:25] what is in the mind of the spirit
[1:33:26] because he maketh intercession for the
[1:33:29] Saints according to the will of God and
[1:33:32] we know that all things work together
[1:33:34] for the good to them that love God to
[1:33:37] them that are called that were called me
[1:33:39] divinely selected or appointed according
[1:33:43] to his purpose for whom he did for no he
[1:33:47] also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:33:51] into the image of his son that word
[1:33:54] conform there means to be in his
[1:33:56] similarity
[1:33:58] in the same form
[1:34:01] he wants us to be in his likeness
[1:34:05] notice but he foreknew us so God had
[1:34:09] foreign that the church should appear
[1:34:11] before him holy blameless without spot
[1:34:14] without wrinkle no matter whether you
[1:34:15] you make it or not God's going to have a
[1:34:17] church without spot or blemish now he
[1:34:19] says predestinate it's not a very good
[1:34:21] word for an evangelist evangelist or a
[1:34:23] minister to use because it kind of
[1:34:25] confuses a people when you say
[1:34:27] predestinate
[1:34:30] it's kind of like being picked last
[1:34:34] nobody likes to be picked last
[1:34:36] well he didn't even pick me
[1:34:38] God don't operate that way
[1:34:41] notice God Knows by forek knowledge
[1:34:45] see there are people that don't believe
[1:34:47] in predestination even though we find it
[1:34:49] in the Bible but God being God he's
[1:34:51] infinite he's all-knowing he knows the
[1:34:53] end from the beginning therefore God had
[1:34:56] foreknowledge he knows what will be
[1:34:59] he knows when it will be how it would be
[1:35:02] God knows it all he knows the end from
[1:35:04] the beginning he knows the choices that
[1:35:06] you will make
[1:35:08] notice now he knows when you will make
[1:35:10] those choices good right wrong or
[1:35:12] indifferent God knows
[1:35:15] so God says not predetermined evil acts
[1:35:18] of man nor does God cause those evil
[1:35:20] acts but rather these acts are permitted
[1:35:23] Because Why by the foreknowledge of God
[1:35:25] God knows that man will make the choice
[1:35:28] that they make and lay him before each
[1:35:30] and every one of us here tonight is a
[1:35:32] choice to receive the word or reject the
[1:35:35] word and I'm here to tell you God
[1:35:37] already knows the choice that you're
[1:35:39] going to make and some of you've already
[1:35:41] made the choice and because of God's
[1:35:43] foreknowledge and he knows the choice
[1:35:45] that you would make he predetermines
[1:35:47] your destiny I say oh glory be to God
[1:35:49] that's why we're here the foreknowledge
[1:35:52] of God the predestination under sons of
[1:35:55] God God knew that you would turn down
[1:35:57] the world God knew you would quit the
[1:35:59] drugs God knew you would quit alcohol
[1:36:00] God knew you would turn things away and
[1:36:03] receive this word and receive this verse
[1:36:05] well because of his foreknowledge and
[1:36:07] because of that he could predetermine
[1:36:09] your future
[1:36:12] that's why he could say that I'll give
[1:36:14] you a new body
[1:36:15] that's why he can say I got a Rapture
[1:36:17] prepare for my bride why because the
[1:36:19] foreknowledge of God has already
[1:36:21] predetermined that you'll be in a body
[1:36:23] change you'll be in the Rapture you'll
[1:36:26] be trashed those streets ago you'll be
[1:36:28] in a new home
[1:36:29] it's all based on foreknowledge
[1:36:34] and if he's God and he is and he's
[1:36:36] infinite there's nothing that God don't
[1:36:38] know
[1:36:41] all right
[1:36:43] he said that's the reason the entire
[1:36:45] church every person that will ever be in
[1:36:48] a Rapture their name was put on the
[1:36:50] Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation
[1:36:53] of the world that's right
[1:36:58] musicians you can make your way back
[1:37:02] we may have part six now
[1:37:06] I'm gonna bring this to a close here see
[1:37:09] God knows he knows your heart
[1:37:13] the Bible tells us in Romans 8 27 he
[1:37:16] searches the heart and he knoweth what
[1:37:18] is the mind of the spirit
[1:37:21] see God being infinite in the beginning
[1:37:23] knew the end from the beginning
[1:37:26] therefore he knew what people would do
[1:37:31] so he could foretell what would take
[1:37:33] place he knew what would be therefore
[1:37:36] before Esau or Jacob was born God could
[1:37:40] say Esau have I hate it
[1:37:43] but Jacob have I loved
[1:37:46] you think man God that's that's wrong
[1:37:49] you chose one over the other
[1:37:51] God knew the choice that Esau would make
[1:37:56] God knew that Esau did not covet the
[1:37:59] birthright
[1:38:01] that he saw despised the birthright and
[1:38:04] when Esau got hungry and when Esau had a
[1:38:07] need and Esau knew the only way that he
[1:38:09] would ever get that need met he had to
[1:38:12] surrender his Birthright and he also
[1:38:14] knew that in Jacob Jacob wanted the
[1:38:16] birthright
[1:38:18] Jacob was willing to do whatever it took
[1:38:20] to receive that Birthright see he knew
[1:38:24] the choice
[1:38:25] and therefore by that choice he can look
[1:38:27] back and say Esau have I hated he didn't
[1:38:30] hate Esau the man he hated Esau the
[1:38:33] choice
[1:38:34] because he choose to reject the
[1:38:37] birthright
[1:38:40] Jacob
[1:38:42] have I loved
[1:38:46] he loves this word
[1:38:48] he loves this message when so many are
[1:38:51] walking away from it
[1:38:53] he doesn't hate him well then no man
[1:38:56] would perish but all will come to
[1:38:58] everlasting life but he knows the choice
[1:39:01] he despises the choice
[1:39:06] he despises a choice but he loves all
[1:39:09] I'm here to tell you tonight Church the
[1:39:12] word is bringing forth because there's a
[1:39:17] people in the land today just play

[1:39:22] today
[1:39:24] like Jacob
[1:39:26] they want the birthright
[1:39:28] and because of that choice
