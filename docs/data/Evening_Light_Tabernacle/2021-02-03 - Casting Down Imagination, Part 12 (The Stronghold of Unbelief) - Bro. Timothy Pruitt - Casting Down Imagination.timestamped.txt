[32:07] just open your word to his father just
[32:09] help us in this time that we're living
[32:10] in
[32:11] the difficulties we're facing lord god
[32:14] we just need you
[32:16] even more than ever father and we want
[32:18] to be with you more than ever
[32:20] lord we commit this service to you
[32:22] father for your glory and for your honor
[32:24] lord may the word strike the mark we
[32:26] pray
[32:27] we ask it in jesus name amen
[32:31] amen turn back to the scriptures second
[32:34] corinthians 10
[32:36] and verse 4 amen it's good to be in the
[32:39] house of the lord amen i'd like to speak
[32:42] to you again on casting down
[32:44] imaginations
[32:46] but to focus in on the stronghold of
[32:48] unbelief
[32:50] stronghold of unbelief second
[32:51] corinthians 10 and verse 4 says for the
[32:54] weapons
[32:54] of our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[32:58] through god to the pulling down
[33:00] of strongholds casting down imaginations
[33:04] and every high thing that exalted itself
[33:07] against the knowledge of god and
[33:09] bringing into captivity
[33:11] every thought to the obedience of christ
[33:15] amen we'll let you be seated
[33:22] amen stronghold of unbelief
[33:27] unbelief is the lack of rich religious
[33:30] beliefs or
[33:31] the absence of faith the absence of
[33:35] faith
[33:36] you know in hebrews 11 would tell us
[33:38] without faith
[33:39] it is impossible to please god amen for
[33:42] he that cometh to god must believe that
[33:45] he
[33:45] is first you got to believe that there
[33:46] is a god amen that
[33:49] and then when you come to him that not
[33:50] only is he god but he's a rewarder
[33:53] of those who diligently seek him amen
[33:56] and i believe that the keynote of the
[33:58] scriptures or to accept anything from
[34:00] god
[34:01] is faith he that cometh to god must
[34:04] believe that he is you know we're living
[34:06] in a world that's
[34:08] as we're going to get into this as
[34:09] getting further and further away from
[34:11] god
[34:12] their thoughts are getting further and
[34:13] further away from god their mind is on
[34:15] evil as the bible would say
[34:17] on evil continually but there has to be
[34:20] a people here that still has faith as we
[34:22] heard sunday
[34:23] amen you know i i i just want to
[34:26] emphasize something here as we get
[34:27] started we've been speaking about
[34:29] strongholds
[34:30] but these strongholds are not here to
[34:32] overcome you
[34:33] these strongholds are here for you to
[34:35] tear them down
[34:36] and this is what we read in our
[34:38] scripture this we we're weapons that
[34:41] we're fighting with are not carnal
[34:43] but they're mighty through god to the
[34:45] pulling down of stronghold so the
[34:46] scripture is already
[34:48] showing us that those strongholds that
[34:50] we're speaking about
[34:51] must come down and will come down and
[34:53] they will come down by faith amen
[34:55] without
[34:56] faith it is impossible to please god the
[34:59] whole world
[35:00] as we know it today was made by faith
[35:02] things were shaped
[35:03] into existence by faith god spoke the
[35:06] word and said let there be light and
[35:08] there was light
[35:09] and then he brought the land forth and
[35:11] he dried it out and he brought trees and
[35:13] birds and all the
[35:15] wildlife that we have today amen by
[35:17] faith that was all
[35:18] done by act of faith of god the whole
[35:21] world
[35:22] is made by faith amen we believe in
[35:25] creation by faith
[35:27] amen for that matter people believe in
[35:29] evolution by faith
[35:31] amen has to seem to me more faith to
[35:33] believe in evolution
[35:34] than it would to be and believe in a god
[35:36] who can say let there be
[35:38] but many many you know many of us are
[35:40] even operating that way in us in our
[35:42] subconscious
[35:43] amen by faith not even realizing you
[35:45] know you say well i'm going to go do
[35:47] this tomorrow
[35:48] i'm going to go home tonight and i'm
[35:50] going to do a certain thing and
[35:51] all right you know i told your boss
[35:53] you're going to do something tomorrow
[35:54] what was you doing
[35:55] he was doing that by faith amen you know
[35:58] you know we don't know how what time
[35:59] will be we may be in eternity by 11
[36:01] o'clock tonight praise the lord
[36:03] but everything that we do is really by
[36:05] faith
[36:06] you have to believe amen you have to
[36:08] believe that you're going to do
[36:09] something for it to be accomplished
[36:11] in your life amen faith he that cometh
[36:14] to god must believe that he is
[36:16] it is impossible to please him without
[36:18] faith you cannot please god
[36:20] and if you say you believe god you say
[36:22] well i've never seen him see
[36:24] so then you've got to believe it by
[36:26] faith amen god is not
[36:28] believed by see taste smell of field or
[36:30] hair you see he is believed by faith
[36:33] anything that the census declares
[36:35] there's no more faith it's
[36:37] it's maybe a scientific fact or a human
[36:40] fact or
[36:41] or or take taste or feel fact but i mean
[36:44] god is not declared by those things he's
[36:46] only declared by
[36:48] faith and you have to accept him by
[36:50] faith
[36:51] and he that cometh to god must believe
[36:53] that god and
[36:54] faith comes by hearing and hearing the
[36:56] word of god you must first believe
[36:58] that you've heard god's word and you
[37:00] must come to god
[37:01] by the word you take the word and say
[37:04] that's right that's all there is to it
[37:06] i'm not taking anything
[37:07] else everything else is contrary to the
[37:09] word i'm not going to believe
[37:12] amen but i'm going to believe what god
[37:14] said and abraham
[37:15] you know had to believe just what that
[37:17] voice told him to believe
[37:20] amen he had to believe that when he was
[37:22] 100 years old 25 years later he was
[37:24] stronger believing
[37:26] he was 25 years along in the promise but
[37:29] he was stronger
[37:30] in the faith amen giving praise to god
[37:33] knowing
[37:33] the god who said it at the beginning no
[37:35] long no matter how long that it takes to
[37:37] come to pass
[37:38] he will bring it to pass and i believe
[37:41] there's a people in this age that has
[37:43] has heard the voice of the living god
[37:45] speak to them and they know that
[37:47] whatever he said he's going to bring it
[37:49] to pass
[37:50] time circumstances has no bearing on god
[37:53] amen but there's going to be a people
[37:54] holding on as we heard sunday amen
[37:57] but unbelief is the root of sin amen
[38:00] people do things they do whether it be
[38:02] smoking or drinking or or adulteries or
[38:05] anything that we would classify a sin
[38:07] they do it because of unbelief amen if
[38:10] they believed god or believed his
[38:12] principles or believed
[38:13] the word of god and the and the and the
[38:16] judgment that would come from doing
[38:17] those things they wouldn't do that if
[38:19] they believed the word of god
[38:20] but because of unbelief because satan
[38:23] has sprayed some unbelief in their life
[38:25] somewhere
[38:25] they would go commit these acts why they
[38:28] don't believe god's word they don't
[38:29] believe there's a judgment they don't
[38:31] believe there's a fulfillment of his
[38:32] word
[38:33] and unbelief has now entered many times
[38:35] over and over
[38:36] into the hearts of men and we see it we
[38:39] know where unbelief came from it came
[38:41] and entered into the heart at the fall
[38:43] amen when eve
[38:44] was reasoning and and and with the
[38:46] serpent
[38:47] and unbelief came into her life now as
[38:50] brother branham would teach us he said
[38:51] sin
[38:52] is unbelief for the first sin was
[38:55] committed by eve because she disbelieved
[38:58] god's word
[38:59] now the act that followed was only
[39:01] because of unbelief
[39:03] amen the act you know was not the sin
[39:06] the sin was disbelieving in god's word
[39:09] amen so because she disbelieved god's
[39:11] word the whole thing tonight and the
[39:13] chaos
[39:14] that we're living in calls by one person
[39:16] disbelieving god's word amen
[39:19] see sin he says there's only one sin
[39:21] that's unbelief
[39:22] a man that drinks isn't that's not the
[39:25] sin it isn't sin
[39:26] it isn't a sin to drink wow
[39:29] it isn't a sin to commit adultery to
[39:31] lies still
[39:32] that isn't sin that's the attributes of
[39:35] unbelief
[39:36] unbelief is a sin if you was a believer
[39:39] you wouldn't do that
[39:42] hallelujah there's only two you're
[39:44] either an unbeliever or a believer
[39:48] i know people want to say well i want to
[39:49] do my own thing and i'm just going to be
[39:51] my i'm not going to serve god
[39:52] you're going to serve one or the other
[39:54] there's two forces in this
[39:56] world there's a god or satan very simple
[39:58] you're going to either serve one or the
[39:59] other
[40:00] amen you can't serve both amen so you're
[40:02] going to either be an unbeliever
[40:04] or a believer one or the other you don't
[40:06] do these things
[40:07] and religious things that you do just
[40:09] because you're an unbeliever you do it
[40:11] because you're a believer in the word of
[40:13] god because christ is the word and you
[40:15] believe his word
[40:16] you're just an unbeliever because you
[40:19] maybe and so you're just an unbeliever
[40:20] because that you believe some tradition
[40:22] or some dogma that's been added to the
[40:24] bible or something like denomination
[40:26] but a real believer always stays with
[40:29] the word
[40:31] amen stays with the word he said he says
[40:33] in another place it says
[40:34] unbelief as it is as old as eden
[40:38] that's where that was born at in eden
[40:40] unbelief is to doubt
[40:42] what god said
[40:46] to doubt what god said and that can go
[40:48] for any promises laying here in the
[40:50] bible
[40:51] to doubt that he has the power to
[40:53] fulfill a promise
[40:55] is unbelief to doubt that he cannot no
[40:57] longer heal the sick that's unbelief
[40:59] to doubt that he can no longer save or
[41:02] he can no longer do the things that god
[41:04] does that's unbelief amen and this is
[41:06] where sin
[41:07] comes from and then attributes of sin
[41:09] comes from it comes from unbelief
[41:11] when she said god said what was it
[41:14] satan began to spray his unbelief in
[41:16] there and begin to
[41:18] twist it a little bit and take you only
[41:20] apart but to very well very one little
[41:22] bit from god's word
[41:24] brings you into unbelief and we should
[41:27] say you know
[41:28] and if we should have any revelation
[41:30] should be presented us that's contrary
[41:32] to the written word we should never
[41:34] receive it
[41:35] it has to come from the word and that's
[41:38] why i'm thankful we're
[41:39] we're living in a message or believing a
[41:41] message that that we can always take
[41:43] back to the bible
[41:44] because the bible is god's written word
[41:47] and if there's anything that you believe
[41:48] that's in the message that's not in the
[41:50] word of god
[41:51] that's not the message but the message
[41:53] is christ the man the message is his
[41:55] word
[41:56] and his word will always amen go back to
[41:59] what it says there in the scripture
[42:01] and you can find it but satan since the
[42:03] fall
[42:04] has begun to spray more and more of his
[42:07] unbelief
[42:08] trying to get people to disbelieve
[42:10] because he knows if he can get them to
[42:12] disbelieve what god said
[42:14] they will miss what god is doing amen if
[42:17] he can get them to miss
[42:19] what god or undone to to not believe
[42:22] what god has spoken
[42:24] amen what happened to esau he traded the
[42:27] birthright for spottage
[42:28] because of unbelief amen lot went to
[42:32] sodom because of unbelief
[42:34] data and core stood against moses
[42:36] because of unbelief
[42:38] the ten spies refused to go in because
[42:40] of unbelief
[42:42] the children of israel agreed with the
[42:44] ten spies and went back into the
[42:46] wilderness why
[42:47] because of unbelief it wasn't that truth
[42:50] wasn't there
[42:52] amen truth is always there but it's
[42:54] whether you will believe
[42:56] truth or not amen they were gay men they
[42:58] were
[42:59] the israel was given over to other
[43:01] nations because of unbelief
[43:03] they didn't possess all the promised
[43:05] land why because of unbelief
[43:07] amen they hid in their tents it wouldn't
[43:10] take goliath's challenge why because of
[43:12] unbelief
[43:13] unbelief took control of them to the
[43:15] point amen as he began to spray it out
[43:18] more and more into the israel
[43:19] into their lives i mean my goodness you
[43:21] can hear god would say i am the lord god
[43:24] you shall have no other gods before me
[43:26] and it wasn't too long because of
[43:28] unbelief they began to
[43:29] build high places and groves and
[43:32] sacrifice to other gods and
[43:34] bring other gods why because of unbelief
[43:38] because if they had really believed him
[43:40] they wouldn't have done those things
[43:42] amen the world that we're in is in the
[43:45] chaos
[43:46] because of unbelief amen we see israel
[43:50] as they review could watch them all down
[43:51] through the scriptures the old testament
[43:53] they come even to the point of the
[43:55] scriptures being fulfilled in a body
[43:57] called jesus
[43:58] the messiah off of paper in the flesh
[44:01] right before their very eyes and they
[44:04] missed him because he got them to
[44:05] disbelieve the word and it came a
[44:08] different way
[44:10] you know the world that we're living in
[44:12] is very dangerous and very vile and very
[44:14] wicked
[44:15] and it's that way because of unbelief
[44:18] you know we're smarter than we've ever
[44:20] been since the flood of
[44:21] the time of noah but further away from
[44:23] god
[44:25] so if it smarts is getting us somewhere
[44:27] i don't like where we're going
[44:30] amen amen we've been we're more
[44:32] scientific we have more scientific
[44:34] advancements
[44:35] but further away from god what satan is
[44:38] doing a good job of spraying his poison
[44:41] of unbelief and is turning this world
[44:44] into complete chaos into complete
[44:47] darkness
[44:48] into amen uh just utter utter violence
[44:52] and everything that's going on
[44:53] you know that brother bannon would tell
[44:55] a story about a man that was in a war
[44:57] and he had been a chaplain and and he
[45:00] you know been working on some guys and
[45:02] he he went outside
[45:04] and the chaplain said officer come to
[45:06] and said chaplain i want you to take a
[45:07] ride for me
[45:08] to go look at the fields i have some
[45:10] things i need to check out and see if we
[45:12] can use again
[45:13] and he said they had thrown out this
[45:14] mustard or chlorine gas
[45:16] as they did in them days and he said i
[45:18] got there brother branham there wasn't a
[45:20] bark left on the tree there wasn't a
[45:22] sprig of grass
[45:23] there wasn't there wasn't nothing on it
[45:26] i i wa
[45:27] here was easter morning there was
[45:28] nothing but old wrecked tanks and
[45:31] and just nothing but destruction and i
[45:33] see myself
[45:34] looking up and i said oh god this is the
[45:36] way it's all coming to
[45:38] it's all coming to this place it'll all
[45:40] be burned up there'll be no life nowhere
[45:43] grass burn off trees burned up gases
[45:46] killed trees
[45:47] everything was killed twisted up metals
[45:49] and hanging but where bullets and things
[45:51] have written
[45:52] he said if that isn't a picture of the
[45:54] world today
[45:55] where satan is praying his unbelief his
[45:58] hybrid his science his knowledge
[46:01] until it's come from a garden of eden
[46:04] into
[46:04] satan's eden into complete chaos
[46:09] into a war zone
[46:15] that's what's left of this world chaos
[46:18] it's complete
[46:19] total rejection of anything holy or
[46:22] anything righteous or anything godly
[46:24] they don't want god in their jobs they
[46:26] don't want god in their schools
[46:27] they want god in their lives they don't
[46:29] want god anywhere
[46:31] they want to just go around their life
[46:33] and just act like there isn't even a god
[46:38] he said i started crying and i walked
[46:39] back he said but i was attracted to a
[46:42] rock
[46:43] and i went over and looked at that rock
[46:45] and pushed it over and down underneath
[46:46] that rock
[46:47] was this little most beautiful white
[46:49] flower growing
[46:50] it was only seemed like living thing
[46:52] left because he had been
[46:54] sheltered by a rock he said god is my
[46:57] rock
[46:58] he's my shelter in this time of
[47:00] poisonings that are flying
[47:02] everywhere in the name of science and
[47:04] education
[47:05] and godliness he said oh god keep me in
[47:08] that day
[47:10] shelter me in the rock
[47:15] i was looking at this as i began to look
[47:17] at unbelief
[47:19] and actually found this interesting
[47:21] article written in the national
[47:23] geographic
[47:24] magazine in april 22
[47:27] of 2016. so almost what five years ago
[47:31] it says the headlines was the world's
[47:34] newest
[47:34] major religion no religion
[47:40] he said you it's beginning to speak and
[47:42] i read some of this
[47:43] it says you usually don't think of
[47:45] churches as going out of business
[47:48] but it's happening and it's even
[47:50] progressively gotten worse as we know
[47:53] we've come a long ways in just four
[47:55] years
[47:56] or five whatever it is in march it talks
[47:59] about a certain church that
[48:01] held their last collective service
[48:04] he said you know it was actually the uk
[48:06] mennonites he said
[48:08] it said it might be easily predicted
[48:10] that the plain dressed anabaptists
[48:12] who follow a faith related to amish
[48:14] would become irrelevant
[48:16] in the age of smartphones but this is
[48:18] part of a larger trend
[48:20] around the world when asked about their
[48:22] feelings on religion
[48:24] more and more people are responding with
[48:26] a man
[48:28] i think that's why we got to be real
[48:30] careful what our response is
[48:32] amen towards the things of god is more
[48:34] than man
[48:36] it's life amen the religiously
[48:40] unaffiliated called
[48:42] nuns that's interesting name but it's
[48:45] not n-u-n
[48:46] it's n-o-n-e-s nuns are growing
[48:49] significantly
[48:51] they're actually this is in 2016.
[48:53] they're the second largest
[48:54] religious group in north america and
[48:57] most of europe
[48:59] in the united states nuns makes up a
[49:01] quarter of the population
[49:04] in the past decade u.s nuns have
[49:06] overtaken
[49:08] catholic mainline protestants and all
[49:10] followers of non-christian faith
[49:12] the lack of religious affiliation has
[49:15] profound
[49:16] effect on how people think about death
[49:19] how they teach their kids and even how
[49:21] they vote
[49:22] they have long been predictions that
[49:24] religion would fade from revelancy
[49:27] as the world modernizes notice as the
[49:29] world modernizes
[49:31] but all the recent surveys are finding
[49:33] that it's happening startingly fast
[49:36] france will have a majority secular
[49:38] population
[49:39] soon so when netherlands and new zealand
[49:42] the united kingdom and australia will
[49:43] soon lose in christian majority
[49:45] majorities
[49:46] religion is rapidly becoming less
[49:48] important than it's ever been
[49:51] even to people who live in countries
[49:53] where faith has affected everything from
[49:55] rulers to borders to architect
[49:59] and we have a new group it's called
[50:01] millennials anybody's heard millennials
[50:03] millennials to god no thanks
[50:06] if the world is at a religious precipice
[50:09] or a cliff
[50:10] then we have been moving slowly toward
[50:13] it for decades
[50:14] 50 years ago time magazine had a
[50:17] headline
[50:18] you can go look it up it just did asking
[50:20] a famous headline on the front cover
[50:23] is god dead
[50:26] now that's quite interesting that the
[50:27] year after the prophet leaves the scene
[50:29] april 19 19 1966 this this magazine
[50:33] would come out
[50:35] is god dead the magazine wondered
[50:37] whether religion was relevant to modern
[50:40] life in a post-atomic age when communism
[50:42] was spreading and science
[50:44] was explaining more about our natural
[50:46] world than ever before
[50:48] this is not a christian article this is
[50:50] this is a secular article
[50:52] this is what they're saying we're still
[50:55] asking the same question
[50:56] but the response isn't limited to yes or
[50:59] no a chunk of the population
[51:01] born after the article was printed may
[51:04] respond with a provocative question with
[51:06] god who so is god
[51:10] dead god who in europe and north this is
[51:14] where unbelief has taken us
[51:17] america started out on some beliefs on
[51:21] beliefs of a
[51:22] god and and religious freedoms and
[51:24] things but unbelief begin to come in
[51:27] amen you can see it in churches when a
[51:29] lot revival to happen it'll turn them
[51:31] back to god but
[51:32] and then they'll straighten up their
[51:34] dress they're straightening up their act
[51:35] their talk their ways
[51:36] and things will begin to happen but all
[51:38] of a sudden unbelief will begin to step
[51:40] in and before you know it they're so far
[51:42] away from what they used to be
[51:45] amen we know we know that to be the
[51:47] truth was right over there
[51:49] and and texas camp they're having our
[51:51] family camp and that man at that
[51:53] nazarene camp come to our services and
[51:55] he said
[51:55] we used to have services like this
[51:58] that's why we don't want to get to where
[52:00] our services
[52:01] is just a mess to us just a common thing
[52:05] or
[52:05] the movement of the holy ghost is
[52:07] something common it ought to be
[52:08] something that stirs our hearts
[52:11] amen it ought to be something that grips
[52:13] us and say hey i have a privilege
[52:15] out of all the people on the earth to be
[52:17] in the presence of the king
[52:18] [Applause]
[52:20] amen before you know it
[52:24] your life will get to god who
[52:29] in europe and north america the
[52:31] unaffiliated tend to be several years
[52:33] younger
[52:34] than the population average and this is
[52:36] this is in 1970 listen
[52:38] 11 of americans born
[52:42] after 1970 were raised in secular homes
[52:47] there's no telling what the percentage
[52:48] is now
[52:51] now notice where they pointed to this is
[52:53] their their article
[52:55] scientific advancement isn't just
[52:58] making people question god it's also
[53:01] connecting those to who to who question
[53:05] it's also connecting those who question
[53:09] it's not just making them question god
[53:11] this advancement is also connected
[53:13] people to other connect you know to have
[53:15] sympathy one with the other
[53:18] it is easy to find atheists and agnostic
[53:21] groups
[53:22] you know even if you come from a
[53:23] religious family or community
[53:25] and anyone who wants companionship that
[53:27] might otherwise come from a church can
[53:29] attend
[53:30] a secular sunday assembly or or a pla a
[53:33] plethora of meetups for humanists
[53:35] atheists agnostics or skeptics they're
[53:38] everywhere
[53:40] he said but it's you know they do make
[53:42] this some thoughts it was quite humorous
[53:44] he said it's not easy to unite people
[53:47] around
[53:47] not believing in something
[53:52] said organizing atheists is like hurting
[53:54] cats
[53:56] this is their eye this is theirs but
[53:59] lots of cats have found their way to the
[54:01] meowri
[54:04] and then it goes on the privilege of not
[54:06] believing
[54:07] can you believe it the privilege of not
[54:09] believing there's a few theory
[54:11] theories about why people become
[54:13] atheists in in large numbers some
[54:15] demographers uh attributed to financial
[54:18] security which would explain why
[54:20] european countries
[54:21] with a stronger social safety net are
[54:23] more secular than the united states
[54:25] where poverty is more common in a
[54:28] medical
[54:28] emergency can bankrupt even the
[54:30] uninsured so
[54:32] it's telling you that you got money
[54:33] you're less likely to depend upon god
[54:37] it's proven amen right there atheist
[54:40] atheism is also
[54:41] tied to education this is their
[54:45] article measured by academic achievement
[54:49] and
[54:50] and general knowledge of of the panoply
[54:53] of beliefs or the many beliefs
[54:55] around the world amen is showing where
[54:58] they are being tied to
[55:02] you know there was two spirits that
[55:04] marveled jesus
[55:06] there was one a spirit of unbelief and
[55:08] the other was a spirit of faith
[55:11] there's two spirits that operate in the
[55:13] lives of human beings all the time
[55:15] until you decide and make up your mind
[55:18] that you're going to believe the word of
[55:19] god
[55:20] regardless of circumstances good
[55:23] regardless of what's around you
[55:25] whether your friends leaving you you're
[55:26] not going to move you're not going to
[55:28] move away from it
[55:30] but until you come to that moment you're
[55:33] wavering between
[55:34] two opinions you're wavering between
[55:37] belief
[55:37] and unbelief and faith
[55:41] as a matter of fact as a prophet in the
[55:44] bible said how long elijah said how long
[55:47] will you halt between two opinions how
[55:50] did they get there because they begin to
[55:51] worship
[55:52] baal instead of god and they're brought
[55:55] to mount carmel and he says
[55:57] how long are you going to halt between
[55:58] two opinions if they'll be
[56:00] god's servant but if god be god serve
[56:03] him
[56:05] and i believe that's the way we ought to
[56:07] be amen if god is godless serving with
[56:10] all of our heart
[56:11] and he has proved himself over and over
[56:14] and over to be god
[56:17] it's actually a sin for us to disbelieve
[56:21] with all that we have seen and our eyes
[56:23] have witnessed
[56:24] it's a sin to disbelieve god in the hour
[56:26] that we live in
[56:30] we can read about it in mark 6 and verse
[56:32] 3. it says
[56:33] they said is this not the carpenter
[56:36] listen to the unbelief
[56:38] oh but they're stating facts but it's
[56:40] unbelief
[56:43] this is is this not the carpenter the
[56:45] son of mary the brother
[56:46] james and joseph and of judah and simon
[56:50] are no are not his sisters here with us
[56:53] and they were offended at him
[56:55] and jesus said unto them a prophet is
[56:58] not without honor but in his own country
[57:00] and among his own kin and in his own
[57:02] house
[57:04] and he could do there no he could there
[57:07] do no mighty work
[57:08] say that he laid his hands upon a few
[57:11] sick folk
[57:12] and healed them i don't want that kind
[57:15] of testimony
[57:17] i want to have a place where god can do
[57:18] mighty works
[57:21] i want our church to be a place that god
[57:23] can do mighty works
[57:24] i don't want to as we heard sunday i
[57:26] don't want him coming through this
[57:27] building and
[57:28] looking to see if there's faith amen
[57:30] brother brandon would be preaching and
[57:31] he'd bring it down to the discernment
[57:33] you can hear him time after time
[57:35] as he begins to wait upon the angel of
[57:37] god and he'd say here he's here
[57:38] and he began to pull out things out of
[57:40] people's life and we get a speak thing
[57:42] and all of a sudden he said it looks
[57:44] like it's getting milky in here
[57:45] he said what is it he said it's faith he
[57:48] said faith is beginning to rise up in
[57:50] people
[57:51] and they're casting down imaginations
[57:53] this is what's happening
[57:54] they're casting down imagination there
[57:56] was a lot of imagination that were going
[57:57] on you can hear
[57:58] he said some of you are thinking this is
[58:00] just uh just uh
[58:02] what is it yeah mental telepathy
[58:05] some of y'all just thinking this is a
[58:06] bunch of hocus pocus he said don't do
[58:09] that
[58:10] just believe amen and when belief starts
[58:14] taking place
[58:15] god can then start working and god can
[58:17] do mighty acts
[58:19] and god can heal cancer why because
[58:21] faith struck a building
[58:24] faith struck a heart god can heal
[58:26] alopecia why
[58:27] faith struck a heart i can i will
[58:31] i do believe what was a mirai doing
[58:34] she was breaking down the stronghold of
[58:36] unbelief
[58:38] unbelief was trying to show her all the
[58:40] signs of her hair falling out
[58:42] and the impossibilities doctors were
[58:44] saying but she turned all the unbelief
[58:46] down
[58:47] and she believed in a god who's more
[58:49] than faithful
[58:50] until the hair began to come out of her
[58:52] head
[58:53] amen i'm looking at a bride that's going
[58:56] to look away from all the unbelief
[58:58] and the naysaying and the
[58:59] impossibilities until they take a step
[59:02] into a new body why because they broke
[59:06] through the stronghold of unbelief
[59:09] and he marveled because
[59:12] of their unbelief i wonder how many
[59:15] message churches god's come to
[59:17] and marveled
[59:23] matthew 8 and verse 8 says the centurion
[59:25] answered and said lord
[59:28] i'm not worthy that thou would has come
[59:30] unto my roof
[59:32] but speak the word only and my servant
[59:34] shall be healed
[59:35] what what did he say he went back to the
[59:38] word speak the word
[59:40] for i'm a man of authority having
[59:42] soldiers under me and i say to this man
[59:44] go when he goes
[59:46] and another come and he cometh and then
[59:48] my servant do this
[59:49] and he'd do with it when jesus heard it
[59:51] he marveled
[59:53] amen he said unto them following verily
[59:56] i say unto you i have not
[59:57] found so great faith no not in israel
[1:00:01] but satan is always trying to block
[1:00:04] he's always trying to build a stronghold
[1:00:07] to keep god's promise from coming to
[1:00:09] pass
[1:00:10] if he can get people to disbelieve they
[1:00:12] are defeated
[1:00:15] amen if but if god can get people to
[1:00:17] believe
[1:00:18] they can be victorious listen you must
[1:00:22] refuse to accept
[1:00:24] the voice of unbelief because it's a
[1:00:27] loud voice in the age that we're living
[1:00:29] in
[1:00:30] unbelief is on every website it's on
[1:00:32] every page
[1:00:33] it's on everything all around us on
[1:00:35] every billboard and every store there's
[1:00:37] unbelief everywhere
[1:00:38] and the voice of unbelief is getting
[1:00:40] louder and louder and louder
[1:00:43] and what is the voice trying to do it's
[1:00:46] trying to drown out the voice of faith
[1:00:48] it's trying to drown out the voice of
[1:00:51] god amen if you have to refuse
[1:00:53] to accept the voice of unbelief and
[1:00:56] choose to believe
[1:00:58] and put an expectation on a supernatural
[1:01:01] god
[1:01:02] did you hear that you got to refuse to
[1:01:04] accept the voice of unbelief
[1:01:06] and say lord i believe and when you say
[1:01:10] lord i believe
[1:01:11] you put an expectation on a supernatural
[1:01:14] god
[1:01:14] that god is more than able no matter
[1:01:17] what the circumstances
[1:01:19] god can do it when i can't even see how
[1:01:21] to do it god will break down through
[1:01:23] every wall he'll break down through
[1:01:24] every truck
[1:01:25] every kind of sin whatever he's got to
[1:01:27] do
[1:01:28] i know some of your parents the voice of
[1:01:30] unbelief is trying to whisper in your
[1:01:32] ear
[1:01:32] and tell you there's no hope for your
[1:01:34] child there's no way he's going to come
[1:01:36] back
[1:01:36] there's no way she's gonna she don't
[1:01:38] went too far that's the voice of
[1:01:40] unbelief
[1:01:40] but we're gonna cast the voice of
[1:01:42] unbelief and we're gonna say lord
[1:01:44] i believe and when you say lord i
[1:01:47] believe
[1:01:48] you're putting an expectation on a
[1:01:50] supernatural god
[1:01:52] that'll break the walls of doubt and
[1:01:54] fear and break through everything he's
[1:01:56] got to get to
[1:01:57] to get your lost daughter and son
[1:01:59] hallelujah
[1:02:00] come on somebody it's a people here
[1:02:02] that's going to break through the
[1:02:04] stronghold
[1:02:06] [Applause]
[1:02:12] amen it was unbelief to try to tell some
[1:02:14] of y'all that you would never mount to
[1:02:15] nothing
[1:02:17] try to tell you never be anybody but a
[1:02:19] drunk or a druggie
[1:02:20] trying to tell you never but all of a
[1:02:22] sudden you heard another voice
[1:02:24] it was a voice of an eagle that said no
[1:02:26] that's not who you are
[1:02:28] you never did belong in that old drug
[1:02:30] power you never did belong in that old
[1:02:33] sin
[1:02:33] world that's not who you are there's
[1:02:36] another voice calling you
[1:02:37] it is a voice of resurrection
[1:02:42] hallelujah that breaks through the
[1:02:46] stronghold
[1:02:50] hallelujah satan tried to put all kind
[1:02:52] of stronghold around you
[1:02:53] all kind of thick walls of unbelief
[1:02:56] amen even in some of you that's been
[1:02:58] raised in this message he tried to put
[1:03:00] strongholds of unbelief around you
[1:03:02] it says a message ain't for you you
[1:03:04] might as well leave and ain't for you
[1:03:06] ain't he's talking to somebody else he's
[1:03:08] not talking to you
[1:03:09] you got to turn down that voice of
[1:03:11] unbelief
[1:03:12] and say that's not the voice i'm tuning
[1:03:14] into but i heard another voice
[1:03:17] just as abraham heard a voice i heard a
[1:03:20] voice
[1:03:21] and that voice said you are my son that
[1:03:24] voice said you are my daughter
[1:03:26] that voice said you are my i put you for
[1:03:29] here
[1:03:29] for a purpose
[1:03:34] hallelujah you think god allowed this
[1:03:36] one to come together and your
[1:03:37] great-granddaddies and grandmama's
[1:03:39] all the way down here and bring you and
[1:03:41] put some of you right and believe in
[1:03:42] homes
[1:03:44] on accident no he has a plan for you
[1:03:48] he has a purpose for you but the devil
[1:03:50] is lying to some of you
[1:03:51] and saying that ain't for you that's a
[1:03:54] voice of unbelief
[1:04:02] abraham was sitting at the door of his
[1:04:04] tent on a real hot day
[1:04:06] must have been louisiana
[1:04:11] real hot day lots of complaints coming
[1:04:14] in lately by the herdsmen
[1:04:16] grass is gone land drying up cattle was
[1:04:19] becoming very thin
[1:04:21] water supply gone almost they found a
[1:04:24] few water holes and
[1:04:26] they were getting low and they dug dug
[1:04:28] till they couldn't find no more
[1:04:31] he said it was a very dark day
[1:04:34] he says we know by nature
[1:04:38] that is darkest just before day
[1:04:46] and many times when we see this that
[1:04:48] this uh disastrous things happening
[1:04:52] especially as believers we must bear
[1:04:54] this in mind
[1:04:56] that satan is trying to block a blessing
[1:05:02] come on now satan's trying to block a
[1:05:05] blessing
[1:05:07] amen it's very much to get so in this
[1:05:09] case satan was trying to tip them
[1:05:11] tempt them to feel they had done wrong
[1:05:15] did you hear that unbelief was whispered
[1:05:17] in abraham's ear
[1:05:19] you done wrong that's why you're having
[1:05:21] all the trouble you're having that's why
[1:05:22] you don't have no grass
[1:05:24] that's why you don't have no money in
[1:05:25] the bank that's why your job's falling
[1:05:28] apart because you've done wrong
[1:05:34] yeah he's trying to tempt them with
[1:05:37] unbelief
[1:05:38] that they had done wrong he was trying
[1:05:41] to block
[1:05:42] the oncoming visitation that god was
[1:05:44] going to give abraham and sarah
[1:05:47] hello somebody don't you know how it is
[1:05:50] on a sunday morning or wednesday things
[1:05:51] get all in a stir
[1:05:52] and it's a very hot day maybe not
[1:05:56] temperature wise but maybe temper wise
[1:06:00] [Laughter]
[1:06:01] oh yeah we got one honest heart in here
[1:06:04] the rest of us uh us christians have
[1:06:06] been a long while we don't we
[1:06:08] you know we don't like to admit to those
[1:06:09] kind of days but it's a hot day
[1:06:11] sometimes
[1:06:11] you got things going things went wrong
[1:06:13] at work things went what is it
[1:06:15] god god it's trying to let you know
[1:06:19] satan's trying to block a blessing so
[1:06:22] he's trying to whisper every kind of
[1:06:24] unbelief why don't you just stay home
[1:06:25] tonight
[1:06:26] you'd be better off just streaming why
[1:06:28] why don't you just stay home and just
[1:06:30] enjoy the couch and then we can
[1:06:32] fix a good old glass of tea and we just
[1:06:34] have us a good old unbelief trying to
[1:06:35] come into your life
[1:06:38] knowing that the word of god says to get
[1:06:40] to church
[1:06:43] come on for the sake not the assembling
[1:06:45] of yourself together amen
[1:06:48] we've had to use streaming a whole lot
[1:06:49] more than normal but that's not really
[1:06:51] what it's intended for
[1:06:52] amen uh if you're healthy and ready and
[1:06:55] and you're
[1:06:56] willing to go to church or have
[1:06:57] something in your heart you ought to be
[1:06:58] in church
[1:07:00] amen but satan comes and he tries to say
[1:07:01] well you just had too bad a day you
[1:07:03] ought not go you're going to be a
[1:07:04] distraction
[1:07:05] you're not going to be but what is
[1:07:06] trying to distract you from getting a
[1:07:08] blessing
[1:07:09] he's trying to distract you from
[1:07:11] receiving something from god do you
[1:07:12] realize some of those services that you
[1:07:14] could have been in
[1:07:15] might have been the time that god had
[1:07:17] dropped in the faith drug god had
[1:07:18] dropped in the power
[1:07:20] and god had dropped in the service that
[1:07:22] the thing that you've been dealing with
[1:07:23] from years could have just vanished
[1:07:35] i read this i've had this in my i hadn't
[1:07:38] preached for here for a little bit so
[1:07:39] i've been working on this but i
[1:07:43] reread this yesterday
[1:07:47] he said satan is trying to tempt you to
[1:07:50] feel you've done wrong
[1:07:52] trying to block an oncoming visitation
[1:07:55] that god was going to give abraham and
[1:07:57] sarah he said and we're taught in the
[1:07:59] scriptures
[1:08:00] that all things work together for good
[1:08:03] to them that love god and no matter how
[1:08:07] bad it seems
[1:08:08] remember it has to be working for your
[1:08:10] good
[1:08:11] oh he said i'm so glad of that he said
[1:08:13] satan's been after me all day
[1:08:15] i just believe there's a blessing in
[1:08:17] store here today somewhere
[1:08:19] i know when he tempts me and he tries to
[1:08:21] block it out what's he trying to do
[1:08:23] get you to disbelieve the worst thing
[1:08:26] you can do is disbelieve
[1:08:28] god and as soon as you get a little
[1:08:29] scared well maybe i haven't done this or
[1:08:32] haven't done that and
[1:08:33] i've done something wrong satan's got
[1:08:35] that blessing conquered right then
[1:08:37] you can't get to it as long as satan
[1:08:39] makes you think like that
[1:08:41] but it's time you begin to think
[1:08:43] differently i'm a son of god
[1:08:45] i'm a daughter of god amen i can look in
[1:08:48] the old testament and i can see where
[1:08:49] abraham's sin
[1:08:50] i can see his wrongs i can see his
[1:08:52] mistakes on the blood of bulls and goats
[1:08:54] but under the new covenant
[1:08:56] the blood of jesus christ as brother
[1:08:57] philip sung about the cross that i'm
[1:08:59] clinging to
[1:09:00] it was a different kind of blood it's so
[1:09:03] rewrote abraham's life that you can read
[1:09:05] there after that new covenant and it
[1:09:07] says he staggered not
[1:09:08] at the promises of god but was strong in
[1:09:11] the faith
[1:09:12] giving praise to god and we are under
[1:09:15] the same covenant
[1:09:17] god i mean what you some of you need to
[1:09:19] realize it ain't a bunch of lousy lousy
[1:09:22] wounds
[1:09:22] and so feeling defeated all the time
[1:09:24] lift up your head
[1:09:26] and realize you got a sacrifice and it's
[1:09:28] not the blood of bulls and ghosts it's
[1:09:30] the sacrifice of the perfect lamb of god
[1:09:33] and he struck away all your debts
[1:09:37] it struck away everything that was
[1:09:39] against you and it said you
[1:09:41] could go free so cast down that old
[1:09:44] wowzy wowzy woo spirit
[1:09:46] and so i'm not gonna bow to you no more
[1:09:49] cast down that bar that feeling of
[1:09:50] unworthiness
[1:09:52] and impossibility and say i'm not gonna
[1:09:54] do that no more
[1:09:55] i am a son of god
[1:09:59] that's nothing but unbelief trying to
[1:10:00] come into your heart
[1:10:02] he's trying to tell some of your girls
[1:10:04] you ain't worthy
[1:10:05] get your pures a lily he's trying to
[1:10:07] tell you it's impossible
[1:10:09] for you to make it but you've already
[1:10:11] been there seen them
[1:10:12] [Applause]
[1:10:14] hallelujah oh glory to caught in the
[1:10:17] highest
[1:10:24] amen but a satan long as satan makes you
[1:10:28] think like that
[1:10:30] you'll never receive nothing from god
[1:10:37] he said perhaps if we would listen to
[1:10:38] such things of temptations like that
[1:10:41] and pay attention to them it would be
[1:10:44] that we would miss the blessing
[1:10:46] he said it's on my mind now to tell this
[1:10:49] particular case
[1:10:51] how i was trying to find a place to pray
[1:10:54] he said god led me into the wilderness
[1:10:56] way down in southern indiana
[1:10:58] where a little girl was laying on a bed
[1:11:00] of affliction
[1:11:02] tuberculosis said she had not raised her
[1:11:05] head from the pillow for nine years and
[1:11:07] eight months
[1:11:08] she belonged to a church that did not
[1:11:11] believe
[1:11:12] in divine healing i'm going to tell you
[1:11:14] if you're listening tonight and you are
[1:11:16] in the church that don't believe in
[1:11:17] divine healing
[1:11:18] get out because it ain't
[1:11:22] that ain't the word of god his word
[1:11:25] don't change
[1:11:27] your dogmas and your own church ideas
[1:11:29] may change but god's word don't change
[1:11:32] so if your father when you're when
[1:11:33] you're following a church like that
[1:11:34] you're following man and you're some way
[1:11:36] off somewhere going straight to hell
[1:11:40] because god don't deny his word
[1:11:44] but unbelief had tried to to camp out
[1:11:47] even in this girl's family in her daddy
[1:11:50] in the church he was a deacon in the
[1:11:51] church
[1:11:52] and his mother mama you know just
[1:11:54] totally ate up with unbelief to where
[1:11:56] they did they didn't they didn't even
[1:11:58] think god could even
[1:12:00] even do anything anymore and didn't want
[1:12:03] brother branham to even come around
[1:12:04] because they thought he was giving her
[1:12:05] false hope
[1:12:08] tell me how is getting healed false hope
[1:12:11] how has somebody got in such a condition
[1:12:13] or a position or place
[1:12:15] in their life that they believe they
[1:12:16] believe healing is a false hope
[1:12:20] when it's the word of god amen see
[1:12:24] i said i've been taking over he said
[1:12:26] taking over a circuit milltown baptist
[1:12:28] church
[1:12:28] me and brother joe and brother aaron had
[1:12:30] the privilege of going and being at this
[1:12:32] little town and looking over this place
[1:12:35] and the lord had been
[1:12:37] going there preaching the revival and
[1:12:38] the lord had been doing some great
[1:12:40] things
[1:12:41] and they sent me to pray for this little
[1:12:43] girl she was about 17 years old very
[1:12:45] critical
[1:12:46] condition her name was georgie carter
[1:12:49] and the good brother who had taken me
[1:12:51] over there her father though was a
[1:12:52] deacon in this church
[1:12:54] did not believe in divine healing made a
[1:12:56] statement if any of the members went up
[1:12:57] to the baptist church while i was
[1:12:59] praying for sit for the sick
[1:13:00] it would be excommunicated from the
[1:13:02] church i would be
[1:13:04] on my way but her father being a deacon
[1:13:07] it kind of put him in an awful place
[1:13:10] but he said i went to see the little
[1:13:12] girl and her mother went out of the room
[1:13:13] and her father left the house and
[1:13:15] they wouldn't have nothing to do with it
[1:13:17] but that little girl had read a book
[1:13:19] that i'd written called jesus christ the
[1:13:22] same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:25] and when i went to her room she could
[1:13:27] not even raise her hands to hold her cup
[1:13:29] to spit in
[1:13:30] what she had coughed she weighed maybe
[1:13:32] 35 40 pounds looked like her little legs
[1:13:34] just way thinner than the florence
[1:13:36] nightingales and the pitcher
[1:13:38] that was healed of cancer and i prayed
[1:13:41] for her and she asked me if
[1:13:42] she was going to be able to walk and i
[1:13:44] said sister the angel of the lord had
[1:13:46] spoke to me and told me to go up in that
[1:13:48] country
[1:13:48] hunt that little girl up but i i don't
[1:13:51] know i i don't know
[1:13:53] and after the revival was going on for
[1:13:55] two weeks and was coming down to the end
[1:13:57] of it
[1:13:58] he said he he was out baptizing 150
[1:14:02] people nearly in the water there at
[1:14:03] tottens ford
[1:14:05] and said i went to dinner afterwards
[1:14:06] some friends and old friend of mine by
[1:14:08] the name of george wright and
[1:14:10] said some something began to press on me
[1:14:12] said go into the wilderness
[1:14:14] and pray and i just couldn't get it off
[1:14:16] my mind he said
[1:14:17] you know when anything presses you like
[1:14:19] that you go do it
[1:14:22] because it's the holy spirit because the
[1:14:25] devil ain't gonna tell you go pray
[1:14:30] amen but see swatch now when he tells
[1:14:33] you something
[1:14:34] there's going to be something rise up to
[1:14:36] try to block it
[1:14:39] amen i remember last year as as brother
[1:14:42] ron would
[1:14:43] feel to feel the need to see as he
[1:14:45] showed up on a wednesday night
[1:14:46] surprised a lot of you with brother
[1:14:48] andrew i remember he was preaching that
[1:14:50] couple sundays or so before and just
[1:14:52] felt the need i got to go to homer
[1:14:54] i got to go to louisiana 17 hours to be
[1:14:57] prayed for
[1:14:58] it was something pushing him a devil
[1:15:00] ain't going to tell you to do that
[1:15:02] amen and then he said i've got to get
[1:15:05] there
[1:15:05] and and and the next that was sunday and
[1:15:08] after that i called him
[1:15:09] just just a week of my mom's major brain
[1:15:12] bleed on monday as i was traveling up
[1:15:14] into oklahoma
[1:15:15] i called him was talking to him about
[1:15:16] that and making plans and he said you
[1:15:18] know at the very end of the conversation
[1:15:20] he said now watch
[1:15:22] he said when god's fixing to do
[1:15:23] something satan always tries to stop it
[1:15:27] and it was just a few days later my
[1:15:29] mom's laying in the hospital
[1:15:31] in an impossible situation and with a
[1:15:33] brain bleed and it seemed like
[1:15:35] impossible to ever
[1:15:36] be back to normal have normal functions
[1:15:38] but satan tried to stop it
[1:15:40] but he missed
[1:15:43] satan will try but that don't mean he
[1:15:45] succeeds
[1:15:47] the gates of hell will be against it but
[1:15:49] it will not prevail hallelujah
[1:15:52] it shows that the gates of hell is going
[1:15:54] to be against you but it won't prevail
[1:15:57] the demons of sickness is going to be
[1:15:59] against you but it won't prevail
[1:16:01] amen demons of sin are coming and doubts
[1:16:04] and unbelief
[1:16:05] will try to come against you but it
[1:16:06] won't prevail
[1:16:12] said he started pushing into the woods
[1:16:14] to go pray
[1:16:17] said mr wright had told him to go he
[1:16:18] said i got a dinner bell i'll ring when
[1:16:20] it's time for supper
[1:16:21] he said okay so the service was about to
[1:16:24] close
[1:16:25] went up the hill and started to kneel
[1:16:27] down so all of a sudden greenbriar
[1:16:29] started cutting me moved over a little
[1:16:33] far
[1:16:33] further and so rough on the ground rocks
[1:16:35] i couldn't get comfortable
[1:16:37] went around the other side of the hill
[1:16:38] leaning too much sideways
[1:16:40] you know the devil was trying to keep
[1:16:42] you from getting the blessing
[1:16:45] that's all it was when i climbed up a
[1:16:47] little further than the thicket i knelt
[1:16:48] down
[1:16:49] mosquitoes were humming around my ears i
[1:16:51] couldn't hardly play pray i believed
[1:16:52] then it was the devil
[1:16:56] hello
[1:17:00] sometimes you don't realize sometimes
[1:17:01] when a blessing's on the way and all of
[1:17:03] a sudden you feel the urge to get up and
[1:17:04] go outside
[1:17:07] come on now you feel the urge to move
[1:17:10] and fidget and this that and the other
[1:17:11] and be distracted no think about it's
[1:17:14] the devil
[1:17:18] he said i said oh lord god be merciful
[1:17:21] when i realized what was going on i said
[1:17:23] oh lord lord god be merciful
[1:17:25] said i threw up my hands and started
[1:17:27] praying anyhow and just let the
[1:17:29] mosquitoes fill up if they wanted to
[1:17:32] you have to completely ignore them
[1:17:34] that's what you got to do with the devil
[1:17:35] ignore him
[1:17:37] amen turn it and turn your ear off to
[1:17:39] him he said but there was something that
[1:17:40] was burning my heart
[1:17:42] and after a while i became lost in
[1:17:44] prayer he said i guess you christians
[1:17:46] know what it means to be lost in prayer
[1:17:48] just forget about where you are that's
[1:17:50] praying in the spirit i believe
[1:17:51] i opened my eyes and just to the side of
[1:17:53] a little dogwood bush
[1:17:55] was a light hanging there and the light
[1:17:57] shining down to where i was at he said
[1:17:59] rise
[1:18:00] and go by the way of carters
[1:18:03] well i looked around it was almost dark
[1:18:05] by then the bell had been ringing
[1:18:07] they had sent search parties out me he
[1:18:09] said i jumped and run through the woods
[1:18:10] as quick as i could
[1:18:12] he said jumped over a little strand of
[1:18:13] wire right into brother wright's arms he
[1:18:15] said brother billy
[1:18:16] mama's been ringing the bell for a while
[1:18:18] we've hunted you everywhere
[1:18:20] he said i said brother all right no
[1:18:21] supper tonight georgie carter is going
[1:18:23] to come out of that bed and live
[1:18:26] he said how do you know the lord just
[1:18:27] met me right up there by that dogwood
[1:18:29] bush
[1:18:30] and told me to go by the way of carters
[1:18:33] oh hallelujah he said dear believe god
[1:18:35] answered on both ends of the line
[1:18:38] while that is happening the woman begins
[1:18:40] to pray about
[1:18:42] go down and get begins to kneel down and
[1:18:43] pray the mother of this girl
[1:18:45] and and begins to pray for her daughter
[1:18:47] and begin to pray you know god
[1:18:49] this man's in the country and he's
[1:18:50] stirring up a fuss and causing my
[1:18:52] daughter to get all out of sorts and i
[1:18:54] don't know what to do i don't know what
[1:18:55] to do about it
[1:18:56] i don't i don't know what to what to say
[1:18:59] it's just laying there dying and him
[1:19:01] coming around saying something
[1:19:03] got her all crying and stood up and
[1:19:04] while she was praying
[1:19:06] she said she's seen a shadow across the
[1:19:08] wall and she thought it was her daughter
[1:19:10] lived a few doors below coming to see
[1:19:11] her in the house
[1:19:12] and when she looked up she said it was a
[1:19:14] shadow of jesus on the wall
[1:19:16] and he said who's this and pointed his
[1:19:19] finger this way
[1:19:20] like a vision seeing my high forehead
[1:19:23] coming in packing
[1:19:24] a bible over my heart she jumped up to
[1:19:26] run to tell her daughter
[1:19:27] and about that time i come to the room
[1:19:31] god moving away the unbelief
[1:19:36] breaking the stronghold that tried to
[1:19:38] encamp a brown georgie carter
[1:19:40] but georgia carter began to believe and
[1:19:42] began to pray
[1:19:44] and it seemed to be impossible her daddy
[1:19:46] her mom went to a church she didn't
[1:19:48] believe
[1:19:49] her daddy didn't believe her mama didn't
[1:19:51] believe but she read something
[1:19:53] and she had heard the word of god and
[1:19:55] she said lord i believe
[1:19:58] and she began to call upon the name of
[1:20:00] god and the angels of god
[1:20:02] heard that little girl's prayer and her
[1:20:05] voice
[1:20:06] actually went in through the amen all
[1:20:08] the way into the other realms
[1:20:10] until brother branham was down there in
[1:20:12] a whole different place
[1:20:13] and he heard a cry bye bye
[1:20:17] a lamb that was tied up in mill town
[1:20:21] mill town mill and that's what even led
[1:20:24] him here
[1:20:32] what can happen for us if we break
[1:20:34] through the veil of unbelief
[1:20:37] the stronghold of unbelief as we've been
[1:20:40] hearing
[1:20:41] when faith comes into your heart it
[1:20:44] assembles angels
[1:20:49] on your behalf and here she is in this
[1:20:53] terrible condition
[1:20:57] he walks in said she seen where her
[1:21:00] she had rubbed the paint of that little
[1:21:02] poster bed with her little hands back
[1:21:03] there crying and crying and praying
[1:21:07] i said before i even knew what i was
[1:21:09] going to say out in my voice at georgia
[1:21:12] jesus christ makes you whole stand up on
[1:21:15] your feet
[1:21:16] i said i don't even know why i said it
[1:21:18] myself i wouldn't have said it for
[1:21:20] nothing
[1:21:21] because of how this little girl gonna
[1:21:22] stand up with peg little legs like that
[1:21:24] not even seem like enough strength to
[1:21:26] even hold a spit cup
[1:21:28] you might ask your mother and she'll
[1:21:29] give you a doctor's statement
[1:21:31] but you know how how is it going to do i
[1:21:33] don't know
[1:21:35] all i can say is there anything too hard
[1:21:38] for the lord
[1:21:40] and when that girl heard that she jumped
[1:21:43] out of that bed
[1:21:44] with those little sticks of legs she was
[1:21:46] standing on and i then i
[1:21:47] turned so feeling through the holy
[1:21:49] spirit and walked out of the door
[1:21:51] in a few minutes her mother fainted
[1:21:53] screaming people began to run everywhere
[1:21:55] she ran out into the yard and was
[1:21:57] blessing the grass and the leaves and
[1:21:59] trees
[1:21:59] first time she'd seen him in nine years
[1:22:01] and eight months
[1:22:02] and people were working on her mother
[1:22:04] because they thought she had passed away
[1:22:07] but that's what happened when a little
[1:22:09] girl began to strike faith
[1:22:13] pierce through the stronghold of
[1:22:15] unbelief that was encamped around her
[1:22:18] and look beyond the voices of unbelief
[1:22:20] even her own mama
[1:22:22] her own daddy's saying it ain't possible
[1:22:24] it's impossible
[1:22:25] you can't do it there's no way god don't
[1:22:27] do that no more
[1:22:28] but she said i believe
[1:22:32] and it struck the heart of god what did
[1:22:36] faith
[1:22:38] and faith brought the answer
[1:22:41] i was speaking about georgie carter one
[1:22:43] time up in a meeting with brother joe
[1:22:46] and the sister came to me afterwards she
[1:22:48] said you want to see sister georgia
[1:22:50] she's passed on now but
[1:22:51] i was a sitter for her in her elder
[1:22:53] years i said well sure i'd love to see
[1:22:55] her
[1:22:56] she turned over a little album she had
[1:22:58] and there was
[1:22:59] sister georgie sitting her little house
[1:23:01] there
[1:23:02] and i was looking at it and i was
[1:23:05] looking at this picture
[1:23:07] and behind i looked in into the picture
[1:23:09] as it were
[1:23:10] and on behind her on the wall was a
[1:23:12] little looked like a little 12 by 12
[1:23:14] maybe plaque
[1:23:15] it looked like some hand-stitched uh uh
[1:23:19] embroidering i forget what to exactly
[1:23:22] call it but
[1:23:23] she had stitched it in there said i
[1:23:26] believe
[1:23:27] in the power of a living god
[1:23:35] i wonder how many tonight can put that
[1:23:37] over your bed
[1:23:39] and say i believe in the power of a
[1:23:42] living god
[1:23:42] they want to ask where is god dead or
[1:23:45] who's god
[1:23:46] i believe in the power of a living god
[1:23:49] you say well that was 50 60 70 years ago
[1:23:52] god is not just a god of 50 60 70 years
[1:23:55] ago

[1:23:58] power
[1:23:58] of a living god we have witnesses in
[1:24:01] this hallway this place right here
[1:24:03] that god done things for just like he
[1:24:05] did for georgie carter
[1:24:07] amen they healed their body of
[1:24:09] impossible diseases
[1:24:11] and impossible things and the word of
[1:24:13] god began to speak
[1:24:14] and said mario your enemy is dead
[1:24:23] hallelujah i believe our attitude ought
[1:24:26] to be more than a man
[1:24:29] more than i don't know our attitude
[1:24:31] would be yes lord i've seen you do your
[1:24:33] work

[1:24:47] ain't it amazing that we get to see what
[1:24:49] we're seeing or something along that
[1:24:50] lines
[1:24:52] that's right i thought boy ain't that
[1:24:54] the truth here we are at the second
[1:24:56] coming of christ

[1:25:07] force and
[1:25:08] seem like it's a great force it's going
[1:25:09] to flood over everything but when the
[1:25:11] enemy comes in like a flood
