[13:14] that me believes this this morning we
[13:16] serve a great guy a man is there
[13:20] anything too hard for him hallelujah he
[13:24] may want to remember Jed Mitchell this
[13:26] morning or JD has fever and a sore
[13:29] throat just a Bethany Dexter's not
[13:32] feeling well this morning I remember her
[13:34] on her Essaouira mr. sandy James's
[13:39] grandson has a friend teenage boy need
[13:43] to really touch from the Lord and been
[13:44] suicidal ask her for prayer this morning
[13:48] also it's been in the news quite a lot
[13:51] about the viruses going around in China
[13:53] and the reason why we're speaking about
[13:56] it there's a lot of believers there and
[13:59] just ask the Lord to be merciful on
[14:01] their behalf Amen that God would stay
[14:05] the plague because I'll just say it like
[14:07] this you know news let so much out and
[14:10] there's you know there's cities of 11
[14:13] million people and saying there's only
[14:16] 56 or so that's so sick or died you can
[14:19] just believe there's more than that
[14:21] going on and so we just know that the
[14:24] Lord though no matter how big it may
[14:25] look or how bad it may look the Lord's
[14:27] more than able a man this blood is still
[14:30] the same yesterday today and forever but
[14:33] it also is maybe affecting our trip
[14:36] that's coming up to Japan there's a lot
[14:38] of the believers from China that was
[14:40] want to be in those meetings and a lot
[14:43] of their visas are being denied and
[14:45] that's really the whole thing as far as
[14:47] from China's being shut down so
[14:50] or just ask the Lord to be merciful to
[14:52] those that are there and gotta just move
[14:55] on their behalf a man you know the
[14:58] plagues that struck Egypt didn't strike
[15:00] Goshen and then because it was a lamb
[15:03] that was there and we have not a lamb
[15:06] today of wool or of a physical blood as
[15:10] far as a lamb that was four feet but we
[15:14] have a perfect lamb it's a lamb that
[15:16] died at Calvary and when he died he paid
[15:19] forever sickness never sinned everything
[15:23] that Amen that could ever be done and so
[15:26] there's plenty enough blood yet today
[15:28] for this need how many would have a need
[15:30] this morning you want to make it known
[15:32] to the Lord
[15:33] that's the Lord to come on amen god
[15:36] bless you let's just pray together
[15:38] amen believers one can chase a thousand
[15:41] two can chase ten thousand this morning
[15:44] as we bind together believing today Amen
[15:48] how many can we chase
[15:51] just missus responding together with our
[15:53] prayers father Lord God we come to you
[15:55] today Lord knowing that we're coming to
[15:59] a Living God with living signs and
[16:01] living wonders a God that we can testify
[16:04] many times of your healing power of your
[16:08] deliverance Lord it's not just a God
[16:10] that's written about in the Bible of
[16:13] thousands years ago and yes we believe
[16:15] those those testimonies Lord of the red
[16:18] sea of the man in the water in the
[16:21] wilderness Lord the many times you
[16:24] delivered the children of Israel from
[16:26] their enemies we believe that but Lord
[16:28] we know that was only testifying of
[16:31] today in the hour that we're living in
[16:33] the Lord we don't serve a God of history
[16:36] or a God of yesterday but we serve a God
[16:39] of today and Lord in this building are
[16:42] witnesses of that healing power of God
[16:45] to come on the scene and to heal cancer
[16:47] and high blood pressures and brain
[16:49] bleeds and alopecia Norden autoimmune
[16:53] diseases Lord there's so many
[16:55] testimonies here that stand in our myths
[16:57] this morning Lord of sickness and Lord
[17:00] we got testimonies of your healing power
[17:02] over sins nor stand in our midst today
[17:04] are those who one wants to drop
[17:06] drunkards and prostitutes and drug drug
[17:10] dealers and things Lord of the other
[17:12] world but God a God who is rich in mercy
[17:15] came down and touched our hearts in
[17:17] their lives Lord we know that you're the
[17:20] same today as you were yesterday Lord
[17:22] and nor do we cry out for these needs
[17:24] that we read today Lord just a Bentley
[17:27] not not feeling well a little jade Lord

[17:33] Lord is dealing with suicidal thoughts
[17:35] more there's no doubt even once here
[17:38] this morning that's had those thoughts
[17:39] in their minds
[17:40] nor we just ask that you would come and
[17:43] you would reach down and touch these our
[17:46] needs this morning Lord for this need
[17:48] over in China Lord we have many
[17:50] believers over there there's many Lord
[17:53] that have accepted you Lord as their
[17:55] Savior in order you're deleting you as
[17:58] their deliverer and you've done many
[17:59] mighty works and miracles there in their
[18:02] midst
[18:02] nor do we know Lord there's no sickness
[18:05] that's ever been known to man that you
[18:07] don't have the blood or the power to
[18:09] heal and we just ask the healing virtues
[18:11] of Calvary would stand between the
[18:13] believers and that plague Lord that you
[18:16] would just have be a wall of fire about
[18:18] them we praise Lord is it trying to

[18:25] attacked Lord and it's Satan's trying
[18:28] everything he can to block it and to
[18:30] hinder and to keep it from happening

[42:08] word this morning and open up the
[42:10] scriptures I want to I want to just kind
[42:14] of give up just a moment just a word a
[42:18] tribute to brother John LaFontaine who
[42:22] just went home to be with the Lord at
[42:25] the age of 76 many of you will remember
[42:28] brother John he hasn't been here in
[42:31] recent years since he's moved up to
[42:35] since he moved up to
[42:39] northern Ohio where was that Michigan
[42:43] where were they were anyway our memories
[42:48] of brother John goes back to the early
[42:51] days of attending the Michigan camp
[42:54] meetings there and the great times that
[42:56] we have there him leading the songs song
[42:59] service so on like that later he was our
[43:02] first camper at the Louisiana spring
[43:06] camp in 1987 and I think about 1985 they
[43:12] had started a camp in Ohio there was
[43:15] some of the brothers and he was
[43:16] instrumental in that and somewhere
[43:22] during that time just in the early 90s
[43:25] brother John invited by the Herald
[43:28] Hildebrandt and myself to come and
[43:31] minister at a convention there for their
[43:34] church in when he was pastor near
[43:39] petrolia in Canada up in Ontario
[43:44] then later day he became back into
[43:48] evangelistic work and he ministered to
[43:50] us and blessed us with message and song
[43:53] and as a pastor then he went to Arkansas
[43:58] right up here three 300 miles north of
[44:02] us to near Hardy Arkansas and and help
[44:08] that church there as they came and they
[44:13] were able to build a new sanctuary and I
[44:16] was privileged to go and dedicate that
[44:20] sanctuary to the Lord and and then I got
[44:25] an invitation to go and preach
[44:27] convention in New Zealand and I chose
[44:31] brother John as a partner to go with me
[44:34] we traveled together to the South Island
[44:37] into the North Island and as you know
[44:41] brother John he was just a very very
[44:42] loveable man a joy to be with we
[44:46] remember his humor and and we had a lot
[44:49] of laughs together and through his time
[44:52] of illness we tried to keep up with the
[44:55] news of his welfare and prayed for many
[44:58] times in his family and today I just
[45:02] want to say our hearts are saddened as
[45:03] we contemplate the going home with this
[45:06] great soldier of God but we know we live
[45:11] for this day and like many others who's
[45:13] went on before us these all died in
[45:16] faith and together we long for the day
[45:21] when this mortal will give way to
[45:23] immortality and we'd like to send a
[45:26] message to his widows sister Loretta his
[45:29] son brother paul lavond Cain Isaac and
[45:33] Sharon and Jerry
[45:35] and all of the family just let them know
[45:38] that our prayers are with them during
[45:39] this very difficult time we're not gonna
[45:42] be able to be with them in the moral
[45:44] service coz Lord willing we're going to
[45:46] be in Japan and the Philippines
[45:49] ministering there but the scripture says
[45:52] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[45:55] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[45:59] a moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[46:01] the last Trump for the Trump side and
[46:05] the dead shall be raised incorruptible
[46:06] and we shall be changed for this
[46:10] corruptible must put on incorruption and
[46:14] this mortal must put on the immortality
[46:17] so when this corruptible shall put on
[46:21] incorruption and this mortal shall have
[46:23] put on immortality then shall be brought
[46:25] to pass the saying that is written death
[46:28] is swallowed up in victory Oh death
[46:31] where is thy sting you know grave where
[46:33] is thy victory the sting of death is sin
[46:36] the strength of sin is the law but
[46:39] thanks be to God which giveth us the
[46:41] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ if
[46:45] you will just stand with me at this time

[51:05] we're gonna turn to Revelation chapter 5
[51:08] this morning for our scripture reading
[51:10] pray the Lord will bless his word as we
[51:13] look into the things of God thank you
[51:16] appreciate the wonderful songs and the
[51:19] worship to the Lord today amen the
[51:22] rejoicing in truth a man is something to
[51:26] be that we can shout about we can
[51:30] rejoice about
[51:31] amen Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 and I
[51:36] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[51:38] the throne a book written within and on
[51:41] the backside sealed with seven seals and
[51:45] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[51:47] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[51:50] book and to loose the seals there are
[51:52] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[51:56] neither under the earth was able to open
[51:58] the book neither to look thereon and I
[52:03] wept much because no man was found
[52:05] worthy to open and to read the book and
[52:07] neither to look their own and one of the
[52:10] elders said unto me we've not behold the
[52:13] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[52:16] David hath prevailed to open the book
[52:18] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[52:22] I beheld and lo in the midst of the
[52:25] throne and of the four beasts in the
[52:26] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[52:29] had been slain heaven seven horns and
[52:32] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[52:34] of God sent forth into all the earth and
[52:37] he came and took the book out of the
[52:39] right hand of him that sat upon the
[52:42] throne and when he had taken the book
[52:44] the four beasts and the four and twenty
[52:46] elders fell down before the lamb having
[52:49] every one of them harps and golden vials
[52:51] full of odours which are the prayers of
[52:55] the saints and they sung a new song
[52:57] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[53:00] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[53:03] wast slain and has redeemed us to God by
[53:07] that blood out of every kindred and
[53:09] tongue and people and nation and has
[53:13] made us unto our God king
[53:15] and priests and we shall reign on the
[53:18] earth now turn with me to Daniel chapter
[53:21] 12 and verse 1 we read from there and at
[53:26] that time shall Michael stand up the
[53:30] Great Prince which standeth for the
[53:31] children of thy people and there shall
[53:33] be a time of trouble such as never was
[53:36] since there was a nation even to that
[53:38] same time and at that time that people
[53:42] shall be delivered every one that shall
[53:44] be found written in the book and many of
[53:47] them that sleep in the dust shall awake
[53:49] some to everlasting life and some to
[53:51] shame and everlasting contempt and they
[53:55] that be wise shall shine as the
[53:57] brightness of the firmament and they
[53:59] that turn many to righteousness as the
[54:02] stars for ever and ever amen father
[54:07] thank you for the word today bless it to
[54:09] hearts now in Jesus name Amen
[54:12] god bless you can have your seats we're
[54:16] going to be speaking today on claiming
[54:20] our legal rights and as we do I just
[54:25] want to share you a little something
[54:27] that was said um that I'm looking for a
[54:32] time of a break forth of the Spirit of
[54:34] God in these last days that we're now
[54:36] living in for another surge of the Holy
[54:39] Spirit into the church for a rapture
[54:42] invades us before it comes and
[54:44] everything is setting straight in order
[54:47] for that and I believe we're at a time
[54:49] that the word should have preeminence
[54:52] and I believe that the time it's the
[54:55] time to lay aside our creeds and our
[54:58] thoughts and come back to the word amen
[55:02] and I think that is something that we
[55:05] can anticipate another surge of the Holy
[55:08] Spirit
[55:09] how many would say I would like to have
[55:11] a surge of the Holy Spirit in my own
[55:13] life personally a man of course send the
[55:17] service and this you want to share a few
[55:20] things that are the few little
[55:22] quotations from a brother branham on
[55:23] revival as we go along he said if you
[55:26] want to see a revival started in your
[55:28] it's got to begin in you so that's what
[55:32] revival begins and they again he said
[55:36] just one or two members good members in
[55:39] a church that's really on fire for God
[55:41] will do something for that church more
[55:43] than forty revivals you could have this
[55:46] is the power of the revival in one or
[55:49] two good members a man a good cleanse
[55:52] mental cleanse member set an example
[55:55] with the face shining with the glory of
[55:57] God with sweetness and humility to stand
[56:00] there in the power of God and then then
[56:04] he refers back again in another instance
[56:08] to the meetings in Vandalia
[56:10] Illinois's back in the divine healing
[56:13] movement back in the the early forties
[56:16] that that in one night in the vandalia
[56:19] Illinois's then he walked in the meeting
[56:22] hadn't been in the meeting five minutes
[56:24] and there was such an expectation in
[56:27] such an atmosphere of faith that there
[56:29] wasn't a feeble person around the place
[56:32] a wheelchairs pushed up out and how that
[56:35] the blind were seeing the deaf and dumb
[56:37] speaking and just simply the Spirit of
[56:39] God was present and everybody was healed
[56:43] but he said now that's when you can do
[56:45] something when revival is going on but
[56:49] you let the revival fire got down then
[56:51] you can hardly the people are still
[56:53] Christians but they're not revived into
[56:56] that spirit it's that great atmosphere
[56:58] that does something this is why you know
[57:02] that I I've asked you you know we made
[57:05] the appeal for you to come early and and
[57:07] pray and call on God that we might
[57:10] create an atmosphere somebody needs
[57:13] saving
[57:14] has to be an atmosphere of salvation
[57:16] somebody needs healing there has to be
[57:19] an atmosphere for healing a man may the
[57:23] word needs to go forth there needs to be
[57:25] an atmosphere created and he and he said
[57:29] it's just like a forge and a blacksmith
[57:31] shop you got to get to iron hot before
[57:32] you can go to pounding it on the anvil
[57:34] if you don't you'll never straighten it
[57:36] out and so that means that we gotta
[57:38] fanned the flames
[57:40] and then that's part of your job this
[57:42] morning you know whether it's someone
[57:44] we're singing and worshipping or praying
[57:47] or whether where the message is preached
[57:50] hiya I know we're in Laodicea I know
[57:53] this is an age where that it's rich and
[57:56] increased with Goods and have need of
[57:57] nothing then and lukewarmness but I'm
[58:01] telling you we don't have to be a
[58:02] Laodicean and man this bride will not be
[58:06] a Laodicean she'll be on fire for God
[58:09] so therefore when there's must be
[58:12] overcomers in this age so there's got to
[58:15] be somebody Fanning the flames
[58:17] hey ma'am and and of course that's what
[58:21] takes to have a revival is everyone
[58:23] under the heat of the Holy Spirit that
[58:26] brought down the powers of God and a
[58:29] revival move on then that's when prayer
[58:31] meetings are going day and night and
[58:33] every minute everywhere while people
[58:35] wouldn't even leave the grounds and you
[58:38] know again when we're talking about this
[58:40] I think we need to make this very very
[58:42] personal you know we we said well I want
[58:46] the church to have a revival well it
[58:47] starts with you I want to the Bride of
[58:52] Christ around the world to be in revival
[58:54] well it starts with you and it starts
[58:57] with us and so you know III can see it
[59:02] you might say I can see it poured out
[59:04] upon individuals in the upper room for
[59:07] example but as God has poured out his
[59:10] spirit and the infinite out in this last
[59:13] days as he said in the last days I'll
[59:16] pour out my spirit saith God remember no
[59:19] we are Auto everyone have a prayer this
[59:22] morning got poured out on me hey man
[59:25] that you poured it out on the church
[59:27] it's important it out on others pour it
[59:30] out on me
[59:31] and I can hear again another quotation
[59:35] saying God created me a revival let me
[59:40] be the revival letter each one of us be
[59:44] the revival the revival in me make me
[59:47] Lord to hunger make me to church
[59:49] created me Lord that what is needed in
[59:52] me let me from this hour on be dying and
[59:56] more concentrated serving a better
[59:58] servant more blessed of you more able
[1:00:00] more humbler more kinder more willing to
[1:00:04] work more looking at things that are
[1:00:06] positive and forgetting the things that
[1:00:10] are in the past and the negatives and
[1:00:12] let me press toward the mark of the
[1:00:14] other high calling in Christ Jesus hey
[1:00:18] man
[1:00:19] again again he says he again talks about
[1:00:24] revival in eastern seal he said men and
[1:00:27] women it'll make you stand to your feet
[1:00:30] it'll make you do things that God wants
[1:00:32] you to do I don't care what somebody
[1:00:35] else says about it the neighbor says all
[1:00:38] that person's lost their mind they pray
[1:00:40] all night they read the Bible I don't
[1:00:42] care what they say is what God called
[1:00:44] you to do or they said well you can't
[1:00:47] have those old-fashioned Pentecostal
[1:00:49] revivals he said all yes you can you can
[1:00:51] have it in yourself and you're the
[1:00:53] majority and God no matter what the rest
[1:00:55] of them think so you can have it in
[1:00:58] yourself whether the world's going to
[1:01:00] pop whether politics are doing this
[1:01:02] whether sin has happened in everywhere
[1:01:04] you can have a revival right in the
[1:01:07] middle of Satan's Eden and ma'am now
[1:01:11] again he says what God - my opinion will
[1:01:16] do and must do and will do in this last
[1:01:19] day is to find a tool for the harvest
[1:01:22] and when he's got a he's got to find a
[1:01:25] tool that's righteous the floor in him
[1:01:27] farmer when he ghost his harvest he has
[1:01:30] to have a tool to do it and certainly
[1:01:32] answer have a sharp sickle or some
[1:01:34] instrument to thrash out the grain and
[1:01:36] the harvest is arriving and his prayer
[1:01:39] was God tickets in your hand and make us
[1:01:42] bond servants of your love and uses for
[1:01:44] a tool to bring realization to this
[1:01:48] sinful cursed world that we're living in
[1:01:51] today that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:01:53] yesterday today and forever and for
[1:01:56] myself Lord God let me be a prisoner
[1:01:58] while my brother internment
[1:02:00] and my friends turned me down I want to
[1:02:02] be a prisoner to Jesus Christ and His
[1:02:05] Word that I might be harnessed to his
[1:02:07] word by the holy spirit to see the Holy
[1:02:11] Spirit make the Word of God be confirmed
[1:02:13] by the same things he said would be done
[1:02:15] I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:02:21] and of course says we look at this what
[1:02:26] he's referring to was that Paul after
[1:02:29] all the scriptures and the training of
[1:02:33] the scriptures under the the great
[1:02:35] theologian Camellia and there were this
[1:02:38] gray ambitions to do something for God
[1:02:41] and his zeal then that was used to even
[1:02:45] persecute the work of God he was so
[1:02:48] zealous and and yet there on the road to
[1:02:52] Damascus the pillar of fire alight
[1:02:56] struck him down who was Jesus and said
[1:03:00] you know you're you're working you're
[1:03:02] kicking against the pricks you're
[1:03:04] working against me
[1:03:05] and he says who are dial or he said I'm
[1:03:09] Jesus and so again at that moment God
[1:03:13] took him a prisoner and Paul would call
[1:03:16] himself a prisoner of Jesus Christ and
[1:03:19] he would be stripped of his own ideas on
[1:03:22] the backside of the desert and become
[1:03:25] harness to the Word of God it would be
[1:03:28] Paul who would actually give us the the
[1:03:31] truths of the New Testament and he would
[1:03:35] lay down the difference between law and
[1:03:38] grace and I just tell you as I
[1:03:42] contemplate or where we are and I think
[1:03:45] about myself McGinn ministering when I
[1:03:48] was only 15 years old and for all time
[1:03:50] and I'm coming up on February the 1st
[1:03:53] which will be 50 years of ministry and
[1:03:56] and you know I saw as I as I kind of
[1:04:01] reflect just a moment I'm not melancholy
[1:04:04] and I'm not I'm not sad I'm not that's
[1:04:08] not the kind of reflection I'm
[1:04:09] reflecting upon some of these things to
[1:04:12] say here's where we are
[1:04:14] and here's what we need to go sometimes
[1:04:19] you can't go any further - you know
[1:04:21] where you're at
[1:04:24] hey ma'am so we want to talk to you
[1:04:27] about a few things this morning as we go
[1:04:30] forward and there will be a lot of a lot
[1:04:32] of different parts to determine and
[1:04:35] probably in the in the well in the
[1:04:38] months to come perhaps more expanding on
[1:04:41] some of this very things the same thing
[1:04:43] but I think you know of course we will
[1:04:47] all have an ambition to serve God and
[1:04:50] the desire to serve Him but you know
[1:04:54] sometimes we we actually have to be
[1:04:57] stripped of our ambitions and didn't you
[1:05:01] know our ideas and our thoughts that are
[1:05:04] different from what God's plan and God's
[1:05:07] Way is and I think what God has been
[1:05:10] waiting on for these 50 years as for
[1:05:14] people to be stripped and become harness
[1:05:17] to the word I think we can look at
[1:05:21] examples in the scriptures such as we
[1:05:24] use Joseph and we'll use some Moses and
[1:05:28] we'll use Paul here and and I think of
[1:05:30] Joseph in the Bible that he spent untold
[1:05:34] years of being stripped of his own
[1:05:37] ambitions and his own desires and his
[1:05:40] own ideas of how the vision would come
[1:05:44] to pass and that it had is a little boy
[1:05:47] where they would all bow down to him and
[1:05:50] he had to be totally stripped down and
[1:05:53] then and then taken a prisoner and then
[1:05:58] then finally they're you know in that
[1:06:01] moment in that time God brings him out
[1:06:03] after untold years now of training and
[1:06:08] and the soul you know we think of the
[1:06:11] Joseph we think of Moses Moses spent 40
[1:06:15] years out on the desert Paul would spend
[1:06:18] three and like David we won't use him a
[1:06:22] lot this morning but David you know he
[1:06:25] he
[1:06:25] been anointed and he had been set apart
[1:06:29] the youngest of all his family and now
[1:06:33] overlooked and and and when they had the
[1:06:36] all his brethren was called for the
[1:06:38] anointing of a king and finally the
[1:06:40] anointing falls upon him but just
[1:06:44] because the Prophet pours anointing oil
[1:06:47] on you doesn't mean you're assured
[1:06:50] immediately in the power and this is
[1:06:54] something that we forget that we we
[1:06:57] think oh well we should have been we've
[1:07:00] been anointed by message and anointed by
[1:07:04] prophetic ministry and we've been set
[1:07:07] apart and we have high ambitions and
[1:07:10] we're going to do this and we're going
[1:07:11] to do that and we're we're we're going
[1:07:13] to we're we're going to excel and we got
[1:07:16] our plans and we got our ideas we even
[1:07:21] get our own little creeps or thoughts or
[1:07:23] a little different thoughts or maybe we
[1:07:26] it ain't a language yet with the word we
[1:07:29] have to be stripped of it all and become
[1:07:32] harness to Christ harness to the word a
[1:07:37] man where we're not pulling our own
[1:07:40] ideas and pulling our own ambitions
[1:07:42] around and living by that but we are we
[1:07:46] are now harnessed to the word and it's
[1:07:48] that word there that we're pulling into
[1:07:51] position and so David would do it would
[1:07:54] be that kind of man that all he would be
[1:07:57] anointed but then and he would be
[1:08:00] accelerating positions and then he would
[1:08:03] be pushed down and out cast and cast
[1:08:06] away and between the fires then were the
[1:08:09] Philistines are on one side and David is
[1:08:12] in the middle and caught in the middle
[1:08:15] and solids over here seeking his life
[1:08:17] over there and and David now knowing the
[1:08:21] anointing that's been put upon him but
[1:08:25] when's it gonna manifest Lord I know the
[1:08:28] Prophet told me I know there are
[1:08:30] promises that are laying in the word
[1:08:32] that must be realized and we must tap
[1:08:36] into but you know this is a
[1:08:39] thing of it is and you know it as we
[1:08:41] come along you know we got to be
[1:08:44] stripped first and it's taking a long
[1:08:47] time to kind of strip out our own ideas
[1:08:50] you know this mother Methodist brother
[1:08:52] wants to hold on to his method is
[1:08:54] teaching and the Baptist wants to hold
[1:08:56] on their Baptist teaching and
[1:08:58] Pentecostal there there there Pentecost
[1:09:00] still teach him but you got to be
[1:09:02] stripped of everything and be born to do
[1:09:06] a man and let this message there come
[1:09:10] that become the preeminent seeing the
[1:09:13] word become the preeminent thing in your
[1:09:16] life where you're not all no longer
[1:09:18] driven by your own ambitions and your
[1:09:21] own desires and your own ideas and
[1:09:25] rebuilding kingdoms with your own ideas
[1:09:28] but becoming an AUSA rendered to the
[1:09:32] Word of God and I believe that God has
[1:09:34] stripped away a lot of our own ambitions
[1:09:38] and our thoughts and our ideas Moses had
[1:09:43] a lot of thoughts of how he was going to
[1:09:45] deliver the people he was told by his
[1:09:49] parents your special child you were born
[1:09:53] under sign you're an answer to prophecy
[1:09:56] you know and Moses fried under his own
[1:10:00] power to make it happen I think there's
[1:10:03] been a lot of that you know good but God
[1:10:07] that take him to a wilderness and strip
[1:10:09] him and make him a prisoner take him in
[1:10:12] his word it was the white moody that
[1:10:15] said Moses Moses spent 40 years thinking
[1:10:19] he was a somebody and you can imagine he
[1:10:22] did he was a prince in Egypt and he
[1:10:25] spent then 40 years of learning he was a
[1:10:28] nobody and then the next 40 years he
[1:10:32] discovered what God can do with a nobody
[1:10:36] a man I think that's where we're on the
[1:10:42] weird starting to discover not with what
[1:10:44] God can do with the new body
[1:10:49] hey man I think we we no longer believer
[1:10:52] to somebody and and and oh we we have
[1:10:57] discovered and learned but now that
[1:10:59] we're just so nobody but now we want to
[1:11:03] find out what God can do with the nobody
[1:11:05] a man because with nobody God can
[1:11:11] produce miracles God can heal God can
[1:11:15] deliver when the church is humble when
[1:11:18] the church is seeking God when the Turks
[1:11:21] realizes I can't do this on my own my
[1:11:24] ambitions will never push me there my
[1:11:29] ideas of my own ways Moses God took him
[1:11:34] out of the desert and kept him there for
[1:11:36] 40 years and stripped him of all this
[1:11:38] theology and all his ambition and all my
[1:11:43] get it what a time he had when he could
[1:11:45] look back and see his failures and
[1:11:48] that's all he could see is I tried this
[1:11:51] and it didn't work and it reminds me and
[1:11:54] and even brother Branham made reference
[1:11:57] to this about the healing divine healing
[1:12:00] campaigns and and he said look at the
[1:12:02] healing campaigns and see what the Lord
[1:12:05] did a few years ago to start restoring
[1:12:08] to the sick and so on and ever
[1:12:12] organization because it didn't come to
[1:12:15] their organization that they had to get
[1:12:18] them a healer to and what did it do you
[1:12:21] know they tried to manufacture you know
[1:12:24] everybody was with an ambition yeah you
[1:12:28] know the the Baptist's would you have a
[1:12:30] slogan back in those times of me and
[1:12:33] more and 44 we're going to be the
[1:12:35] biggest and we're gonna be the greatest
[1:12:37] and and then the others will outrank
[1:12:40] them and and then so on and on and they
[1:12:43] become a competition between them all
[1:12:45] you know I didn't among the divine
[1:12:48] healing movement you know we we went out
[1:12:50] and tried so hard to manufacture some
[1:12:53] kind of miracles
[1:12:54] I smell to disease or I got blood
[1:12:57] and.and you manufacture a miracle what
[1:13:02] they get they got men and such strings
[1:13:05] then it broke up and some actually
[1:13:08] became alcoholics and neurotic and got
[1:13:12] their mind switched all the way back
[1:13:14] from the real true Pentecostal objective
[1:13:18] back to making organizations again and
[1:13:22] which is a cure which again is kingdom
[1:13:25] building that's we're talking about and
[1:13:27] what did he do it's LuAnn Egyptian
[1:13:31] that's all that Moses had to point to
[1:13:35] when he pointed back to what are you
[1:13:38] done as a somebody a mom you know he had
[1:13:44] one man he didn't deliver Israel from
[1:13:47] from Egypt he killed one new one
[1:13:50] Egyptian that's all he had the point to
[1:13:54] was one stinking dead Egyptian and in
[1:13:59] many ways that's what we can point back
[1:14:01] to is is you know again whoa what did we
[1:14:05] accomplish or what has been accomplished
[1:14:07] and a lot of this just checks members
[1:14:11] and maybe maybe somebody live true to
[1:14:14] their life or quit stealing or something
[1:14:17] and all that's good
[1:14:19] and out more the chips and Danny's is is
[1:14:23] one of Jeff's and dad but he don't
[1:14:25] deliver the people I'm I'm it doesn't it
[1:14:31] doesn't deliver Israel it doesn't bring
[1:14:34] them to their promised land it doesn't
[1:14:37] produce a rapture a man that we want
[1:14:40] more than church members come on we want
[1:14:45] to see a people prepared for the coming
[1:14:47] of the Lord
[1:14:48] ready to meet the Lord as he promised he
[1:14:52] would I still believe he's coming back
[1:14:55] said a man I believe is promised and
[1:15:00] there's got to be a people that is ready
[1:15:02] for that but again you know when the
[1:15:14] blessing comes out on how we must be
[1:15:18] born again how to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:15:21] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ all
[1:15:24] these things instead of people staying
[1:15:26] harnessed to the word they just started
[1:15:29] their own denominational theory and so
[1:15:32] what we have is again in too many cases
[1:15:37] about the rotten church members who are
[1:15:41] so full of their organization who deny
[1:15:44] the very scriptures that are so plain in
[1:15:48] the Bible a man that they would refuse
[1:15:52] such a thing they don't want the world
[1:15:54] to have preeminence in the church but we
[1:15:58] do I just say it again we do I'm I know
[1:16:05] they may not permit this kind of
[1:16:08] preaching but we knew we will preach
[1:16:11] what the original sin was will preach
[1:16:14] the security of the believer will preach
[1:16:17] baptism in its name
[1:16:18] cuz there was nobody ever baptized any
[1:16:21] other way that in the name of Jesus
[1:16:23] Christ in the entire Bible and my will
[1:16:26] will preach the will preach will word
[1:16:29] after word because we have been
[1:16:32] harnessed to this word and we're not
[1:16:36] denying in it
[1:16:37] we're not warming loose from our
[1:16:41] ambitions are gone
[1:16:44] to do our own thing but let me tell you
[1:16:51] we have become a prisoner to Jesus
[1:16:55] Christ and if we just keep in our mind
[1:17:00] then according to the Word of God 'no
[1:17:02] sliced day god's gonna have a church and
[1:17:05] we're gonna be that church he's gonna
[1:17:09] have a people and a bride without spot
[1:17:11] or wrinkle we're gonna be that church
[1:17:14] and man there's going to be a people
[1:17:17] that are in revival at the coming of the
[1:17:20] lord we're gonna be that church a mouth
[1:17:25] we're living in that time and christ
[1:17:28] makes us prisoners of love his sons and
[1:17:32] he gives them power he brings them into
[1:17:35] power John 14:12 the miracles that I do
[1:17:38] shall you do also and greater than these
[1:17:41] how you do they become empowered by the
[1:17:45] king and again verily I say unto you if
[1:17:49] you say to this mountain be moved and
[1:17:52] don't doubt in your heart you will have
[1:17:56] what you said a man if you abide in me
[1:17:59] and my words abide in you Oh hallelujah
[1:18:03] I believe God's got somebody that the
[1:18:06] word will live in and they will abide in
[1:18:09] that word and the word will abide in
[1:18:11] them and when the Holy Ghost don't come
[1:18:14] and it don't go it stays in it abides we
[1:18:18] don't backslide mild in the world next
[1:18:20] week we're right there constant steady
[1:18:23] believe in God's Word harness to him and
[1:18:26] yoke to him abiding in him and he in us
[1:18:30] now just briefly another one to spend a
[1:18:39] lot of time on this but I'm just kind of
[1:18:41] just speaking about some of these
[1:18:44] characters for a moment but there's
[1:18:46] Joseph who is are so prisoner you know
[1:18:51] he raised up a young boy he comes in and
[1:18:55] anyhow a dream
[1:18:58] he dreams of the the the sheaves bowing
[1:19:03] to him of his brothers men he dreams of
[1:19:06] the Sun and the moon the Stars and and
[1:19:09] his brothers this to be the other stars
[1:19:12] they're representing his whole family
[1:19:15] bowing to him you know a lot of times we
[1:19:19] hear these things and we hear we
[1:19:22] predestinated we're called we're chosen
[1:19:26] and sometimes it makes a bunch of
[1:19:29] stuffed shirt type of people we're the
[1:19:35] bride we're the elect we're the call
[1:19:37] we're the chosen we're the people and a
[1:19:42] lot of times as I said it makes a
[1:19:44] haughty attitude and a haughty spirit
[1:19:49] but God doesn't want that in our lives
[1:19:53] it is wasn't this wasn't given to you to
[1:19:56] make you a little swell in your head so
[1:20:00] this is why the God sometimes has to
[1:20:03] take it kind of grind you down a little
[1:20:05] bit and make you realize though I said
[1:20:07] your preps don't I give you a vision
[1:20:12] don't I give you a word though I gave
[1:20:15] you a message I mean you need to be
[1:20:18] stripped down a little bit for your
[1:20:19] given power but I tell you I believe
[1:20:23] that we're at a time where the stripping
[1:20:26] is over hallelujah are you with me now
[1:20:31] I believe it is a time where Joseph seed
[1:20:35] says his face I'm there I wouldn't talk
[1:20:39] about you doesn't a man god bless you
[1:20:41] welcome back
[1:20:42] amen but according to that you go but
[1:20:46] Joseph changed his face and he comes out
[1:20:49] of prison are you with me he's elevated
[1:20:55] the power
[1:20:57] are you with me hey man you know that
[1:21:01] some things have been saved out for them
[1:21:03] and there he was now prepared and for
[1:21:07] all of these years for the vision to be
[1:21:09] manifested and I will show you I believe
[1:21:13] we're in the hour of the manifestation
[1:21:16] of the vision hallelujah but sometimes
[1:21:22] we'll take a man like Joseph and shave
[1:21:25] off their wheels and show them they
[1:21:27] can't just do anything they want to do
[1:21:29] they've got to rely on God they got a
[1:21:32] son humble to the word before they can
[1:21:34] come into full power but God would take
[1:21:37] him out of that prison and exalt him to
[1:21:39] the throne so there come a time where
[1:21:45] all of these men Joseph Moses and Paul
[1:21:50] they all had to stand upon their calling
[1:21:54] they had to come and stand take a stand
[1:21:58] what's these words that I'm using
[1:22:01] because we're we're talking about a lamb
[1:22:04] that stood up Michael it stands up we're
[1:22:09] talking about Joseph standing up we're
[1:22:13] talking about Paul standing up we're
[1:22:16] talking about again Moses he stands up
[1:22:20] empowered and commissioned under pillar
[1:22:24] of fire and he takes a stand there to
[1:22:28] claim their legal rights now in all
[1:22:35] cases all of these men thought there
[1:22:38] were somebody and they learned they were
[1:22:40] nobody Joseph the favored son with his
[1:22:44] dreams and in a slave in Egypt Moses of
[1:22:48] France reduced to a common Shepherd in
[1:22:50] median Paul a Pharisee of the Pharisees
[1:22:53] knocked off his high horse and finds
[1:22:56] himself in the desert had to be retaught
[1:22:59] and retained a man boy and Joseph stood
[1:23:05] up out of the prison he came to be right
[1:23:07] next
[1:23:09] when Moses stood up at a million he came
[1:23:12] with a word in his lips and brought a
[1:23:14] mighty Egypt down to its knees
[1:23:16] when Paul stood up and out of the desert
[1:23:19] he came with signs and wonders and
[1:23:22] miracles and God's Word opened to him
[1:23:25] what the New Covenant was about now I'm
[1:23:35] just going to make a little change here
[1:23:41] since I built that platform and I want
[1:23:46] to talk about our message I want to talk
[1:23:54] about our message brother Timothy I want
[1:24:00] to talk about your message Church I want
[1:24:05] to talk to you about your message Joseph
[1:24:14] comes and when he comes into power he
[1:24:18] comes with a message Paul when he comes
[1:24:22] into power he comes out with a message
[1:24:28] Moses when he comes into power and he
[1:24:31] takes a stand he comes out with a
[1:24:33] message and don't get scared
[1:24:42] I'm not talking about a different
[1:24:45] message
[1:24:46] I'm talking about a message of
[1:24:48] restoration were that we become focused
[1:24:53] on what our real calling is because
[1:24:57] we've had a lot of ideas in the past of
[1:25:00] what it would be and how it would be and
[1:25:03] how it's all materialized now all come
[1:25:05] to pass you know I can go through I can
[1:25:10] go through the literally nothing
[1:25:11] another hour on Joseph's talking about
[1:25:14] it his dream and how he did it seemed
[1:25:17] like it it would be manifesting this and
[1:25:19] oh oh oh this is how it would be now and
[1:25:22] now I see and I become a great man in
[1:25:23] Potiphar's house and my brethren will
[1:25:26] come and somehow they'll see me as a
[1:25:27] great man in this house then again but
[1:25:35] that wasn't the fulfillment then there
[1:25:38] would be oh I think it still sigh I've
[1:25:41] been thrown into prison now and and
[1:25:43] surely in the prison maybe some of my
[1:25:45] brothers would be thrown in here and I'm
[1:25:47] the head of the prison now and I wasn't
[1:25:49] it you see people's done a lot of
[1:25:56] guessing through the years
[1:26:00] have a lot of ideas through the years a
[1:26:04] lot of false leads through the years and
[1:26:09] yet all of those were leading up to a
[1:26:14] greater crescendo now let me just stop
[1:26:20] here for a moment you know we have
[1:26:23] brother Ron Spencer
[1:26:26] he's comes from a little town in
[1:26:29] grottoes Virginia and in this he's
[1:26:36] pastors a little Church up what's the
[1:26:43] name of that town Timothy Elton has a
[1:26:49] little church there and Elton was there
[1:26:52] Virginia and and of course you know we
[1:26:56] he's preached our youth camps through
[1:26:59] the years our camp meetings to the years
[1:27:01] and we know him from that you know him
[1:27:03] from that being here with us and many
[1:27:06] many things we've seen the supernatural
[1:27:09] that has worked and the Holy Spirit
[1:27:12] moving in different aspects but on
[1:27:15] December the 30th 2016 brother Ron
[1:27:18] Spencer had a dream in this dream I was
[1:27:21] with him with brother Bisco and we had
[1:27:25] just finished a meeting when were
[1:27:27] rejoicing over the accomplishments and
[1:27:29] the victories there and and this dream
[1:27:32] people were taking photos of us and this
[1:27:35] would be fulfilled in Switzerland when I
[1:27:37] went there I didn't go to youth camp and
[1:27:39] I went to the Switzerland meetings and
[1:27:42] we would preach there it was a very
[1:27:44] sovereign God ordained meeting brother
[1:27:47] Bisco wasn't even supposed to be there
[1:27:49] because of illness and so on and God
[1:27:53] made a way that he was there and he
[1:27:54] spoke in that meeting as well and so you
[1:27:59] know but but the dream was showing him
[1:28:02] there and this would be fulfilled but
[1:28:04] then the dream changed to a memorial
[1:28:06] servant service and then this brother
[1:28:10] Timothy would speak own
[1:28:13] am the resurrection and the life and
[1:28:16] then I came to the pulpit and I spoke on
[1:28:20] the subject of all thou suffer stand and
[1:28:24] be healed and as I spoke this in the
[1:28:28] dream I actually addressed brother Ron
[1:28:32] specifically and acknowledge that
[1:28:35] acknowledge him that you know that he
[1:28:37] was presence and I called his name that
[1:28:39] I want to greet brother Ron here and and
[1:28:43] an announcement X to him of what I was
[1:28:46] speaking and then of course um there the
[1:28:53] dream would am that in the end brother
[1:28:55] Ron would come to in his bedroom and the
[1:28:58] presence of God would just come right in
[1:29:01] and feel his bedroom and he spoke in
[1:29:03] tongues for over a half an hour and then
[1:29:07] he he text me the dream and I went back
[1:29:11] into my my files and looked at and
[1:29:15] looked at at the time and the time of
[1:29:17] day it would just be an hour so later
[1:29:20] that his son-in-law
[1:29:22] Whitney's husband Davey who had been
[1:29:27] promised a child would would be crushed
[1:29:29] with his with his truck crushed up
[1:29:33] against a tree after hitting black ice
[1:29:35] he would be crushed in different aspects
[1:29:39] of his body and especially a broken
[1:29:42] pelvis and the doctors told him he would
[1:29:44] never have children and then of course
[1:29:48] his wife was it had already been told by
[1:29:50] doctors she would never have children
[1:29:52] she she was had a female condition where
[1:29:56] wound was tilted and the doctor said it
[1:29:58] was medically impossible for her to ever
[1:30:00] have a child so now the word of the Lord
[1:30:04] had already spoken that she was going to
[1:30:08] have a child
[1:30:09] now then impossible impossible
[1:30:12] situations arise and Davey was a supper
[1:30:20] he was a supper but he took that word of
[1:30:25] promise that was
[1:30:26] was given and he stood up on that
[1:30:29] promise that he was healed and then some
[1:30:34] some months if I could say it uh you
[1:30:37] know about a year later little over a
[1:30:39] year later
[1:30:40] here she comes up with pregnant you know
[1:30:43] expecting a child
[1:30:44] it was impossible for this this girl
[1:30:48] that when she married this boys he told
[1:30:50] him I want you to know doctor said I'll
[1:30:52] never have children he said well I'm not
[1:30:54] marrying your cousin children I'm
[1:30:55] married because I love you and yet yep
[1:31:00] God you know so graciously spoke life to
[1:31:04] that wound are you with me someone who
[1:31:11] was suffered that was healed that's turn
[1:31:19] upon that promise just you just hours
[1:31:22] after that now hours after this wreck
[1:31:24] brother Ron's mother would just you know
[1:31:28] would have a heart attack be taking the
[1:31:30] hospital and Jenner suffering in her
[1:31:34] health issues you know what would would
[1:31:38] cause her to UM to have a massive heart
[1:31:43] attack and she's laying there but the
[1:31:46] wrong went to her and she spoke these
[1:31:48] words as the doctor said you know can I
[1:31:51] help you cannot do anything she said no
[1:31:54] I'm ready to go and when she said that
[1:31:57] she stepped out with his life into a new
[1:32:01] body and England ain't always in one
[1:32:06] dimension but it's all healing God heals
[1:32:10] all diseases like I told the LaFontaine
[1:32:14] family these all died in faith now so
[1:32:18] again again you know there she moved
[1:32:21] from there into a new and youthful body
[1:32:23] and you know I called brother Ron on the
[1:32:26] way to see his mom and I said you know
[1:32:29] your son-in-law your son-in-law is gonna
[1:32:32] stand and he's gonna be healed but your
[1:32:35] mother is gonna be healed by taking
[1:32:37] another
[1:32:38] dimension in just a few minutes she
[1:32:41] would go beyond the curtain of time and
[1:32:45] sometimes later III it was in April to
[1:32:48] 26 that I I felt inspired to take that
[1:32:53] that little sermon title all that suffer
[1:32:58] stand and be healed and I preached it on
[1:33:01] April the 26th 2017 and her home church

[1:40:36] early signs it's the early signs man so
[1:40:43] well you know but but I ask you have we
[1:40:46] got rid of our own ideas are we ready to
[1:40:50] be the revival to come out at that
[1:41:11] dormant stage into the full bloom of the
[1:41:14] promise well the church today is still
[1:41:20] in general is still operating on since
[1:41:23] knowledge instead of faith they're going
[1:41:25] on how they feel since knowledge is he
[1:41:29] taste smell feeling here so if you hear
[1:41:31] me use that term that's what I'm talking
[1:41:33] about and they're they're still going by
[1:41:35] since knowledge but now we should be a
[1:41:38] people who look to the unseen instead of
[1:41:42] what we see around us I was listening to
[1:41:46] determine the greatest battle ever
[1:41:47] fought her brother branham tell a dream
[1:41:50] of his former trainer he he was a boxer
[1:41:54] who was trained him for
[1:41:58] think it was 16 professional or 15
[1:42:01] professional bouts
[1:42:02] anyway six-second smith was his trainer
[1:42:06] and yeah he also had a dream where he
[1:42:09] was watching Smith fight even fellows
[1:42:12] that are much younger than himself this
[1:42:15] is very important hang on yep yep Smith
[1:42:21] was smashing him down and throwing him
[1:42:24] out of the ring he kept talking about
[1:42:26] this old man he said I think he's 58
[1:42:28] years old lot of old men in here but
[1:42:39] that's alright old men the dream dreams
[1:42:40] and young men see visions and I've even
[1:42:46] been praying God giving me the visions I
[1:42:49] missed as a young man
[1:42:54] so you see you see again he was watching
[1:42:57] these these these young men these young
[1:43:00] fellows fight that was much younger and
[1:43:02] Smith was just thrashing them and doing
[1:43:05] them out of the ring and the young guys
[1:43:07] could not stand up against the trainer
[1:43:10] and then he remarked to his wife and who
[1:43:15] was standing there by ripples in his
[1:43:17] church and he said they he said Smith
[1:43:20] was my first training and then he then
[1:43:23] he then he would later talk about and he
[1:43:25] says you know that was my first training
[1:43:28] the first prayer lines and he was just
[1:43:33] saying it right there just saying that
[1:43:36] as he was talking about you know the
[1:43:38] young guys with their new trainer won't
[1:43:43] stand up to the old training
[1:43:49] a man the new ideas of easy believe ISM
[1:43:54] the new ideas of no paralyzing
[1:44:00] experience to have the Holy Ghost
[1:44:03] [Applause]
[1:44:22] [Applause]
[1:44:27] [Applause]
[1:44:50] you're born again the news that's what a
[1:44:54] wind
[1:45:05] brother around the message I bought your
[1:45:09] new ideas and they don't win they don't
[1:45:16] win you can't baptize them in you can't
[1:45:20] pet a man you can't say just have this
[1:45:23] profession of faith I believe the
[1:45:25] message in it won't work it takes a new
[1:45:29] birth and that's not a new birth when
[1:45:40] you listen to that sermon again greatest
[1:45:42] battle ever fought you'll hear a common
[1:45:44] thread the whole thing and that is our
[1:45:47] training training training he mentions
[1:45:52] this over 20 times in his whole message
[1:45:54] is laced in and out our training that we
[1:45:59] we should have been trained for this
[1:46:01] hour he was told in that same vision you
[1:46:06] know which becomes interpreted it's a
[1:46:08] vision and he's he says it changed from
[1:46:10] there and I won't go into all of it but
[1:46:12] he was told there to stay home and store
[1:46:14] up food and and so you know we got it I
[1:46:18] just want to say we need to go back to
[1:46:21] that training we need to use those same
[1:46:28] kind of fighting methods we need see
[1:46:31] faith demonstrated
[1:46:33] oh we can we have elevated doctor into
[1:46:36] such a place
[1:46:37] are you with me but doctors without
[1:46:40] miracles is not true doctor Jesus doctor
[1:46:46] was released with miracles follow them
[1:46:53] that believe
[1:46:56] with science following the battle is now
[1:47:03] so who will stand that was his whole
[1:47:06] premise for preaching that sermon he
[1:47:08] solved the stars in the heaven and they
[1:47:10] all stay in their course and they all
[1:47:12] stay in their place and have been there
[1:47:15] for millions of years but you let a
[1:47:16] little problem come and you get out of
[1:47:18] your course and then you let a little
[1:47:22] storm come on and blow you this way in
[1:47:24] that way and the soldiers and the
[1:47:28] heavens are supposed to be cold I just
[1:47:30] read you that we'd sign as the stars in
[1:47:32] the heaven they are reflectors are what
[1:47:34] we're to be on the earth are you with me
[1:47:38] now and if they stay there courts and
[1:47:41] the time the trial we got to stay on
[1:47:43] course steady right there believe it
[1:47:46] God's Word that's saith the Lord the
[1:47:52] truth you see God's army is moving
[1:47:59] forward men of valor men of faith men of
[1:48:01] power men of understanding you know they
[1:48:03] don't have to be educated they need to
[1:48:05] be channels but to be a channel you
[1:48:08] gotta have your it's cleaned out then we
[1:48:10] go back around our our training you
[1:48:12] gotta clean out your alot Diaz and your
[1:48:15] all the ways and and come to a place
[1:48:17] that God can flow through you I'm
[1:48:20] hindered we should have learned by now
[1:48:24] the doctrine without without power
[1:48:27] you know they won't work and that
[1:48:31] mechanics without dynamics will not work
[1:48:34] and confessions of faith without
[1:48:36] experience won't produce to Christians
[1:48:40] and we should have learned by now that
[1:48:42] easy believe ISM won't work I neither
[1:48:46] will just emotion and emotion is fine
[1:48:51] but we want results with it
[1:48:54] are you with me haha oh yeah I'll talk
[1:48:59] about it friends is when there's emotion
[1:49:01] you won't works to go with it hey man
[1:49:05] you want to see the miraculous go with
[1:49:07] it
[1:49:08] I remember the emotion of it when sister
[1:49:10] Lydia stood and she grabbed her
[1:49:13] suffering baby Judah with a
[1:49:16] non-functioning kidneys that the doctors
[1:49:18] were thinking of removing and she stood
[1:49:23] brought that child down to the altar are
[1:49:26] you with me
[1:49:27] [Applause]
[1:49:33] we've got a perfectly cute boy
[1:49:36] let's didn't need a surgery they were
[1:49:40] gonna remove but it was no good he moved
[1:49:42] out of his body but God's healing power
[1:49:46] buddy
[1:49:49] [Applause]
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:50:03] I remember the mother
[1:50:10] wisdom supper Aaron Oglesby big tall man
[1:50:17] ran down to the altar and surrendered
[1:50:20] his life to God and if you think I'm
[1:51:01] getting redundant I'm reminded you of
[1:51:04] some things I'm reminding you this is
[1:51:08] our message it is a message of
[1:51:11] restoration I remember the emotion of it
[1:51:29] when that sister little sister Karen my
[1:51:34] wife stood on the promise there with a
[1:51:39] brain bleed this big doctor said it
[1:51:42] don't look hopeful senator specialist
[1:51:45] and there the Holy Spirit moving and I
[1:51:49] said should be and I see you tonight
[1:51:52] the Mars should be in her own room
[1:51:54] they're not then the next day should be
[1:51:56] at home but you know sometimes you don't
[1:51:59] understand that the miracles happen
[1:52:02] in the midst of healing that healing is
[1:52:05] a process ma'am
[1:52:09] a man at that same time little drew
[1:52:12] there are a baby you know this but I'm
[1:52:14] telling it again a man a little bug rude
[1:52:18] but born with a deformed hip

[1:52:22] concerned about it in the Children's
[1:52:24] Hospital give him that a County at night

[1:52:32] step you know he was he was a little
[1:52:36] crippled boy and down there

[1:52:43] floor at the foot of the bed the
[1:52:51] sufferer with blind eyes clearly

[1:53:39] [Applause]
[1:53:47] [Applause]
[1:53:48] [Music]
[1:53:50] [Applause]
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:03] let me tell you a little more of it some
[1:54:05] things you don't even know maybe some
[1:54:07] things I've never told some things I
[1:54:12] need to tell because I'm getting
[1:54:14] questions about it let me talk about it
[1:54:21] for a minute
[1:54:22] I remember the emotion of that following
[1:54:28] wins tonight after that happened for
[1:54:33] sister Karen I died you know she's still
[1:54:35] dealing like said healing as many times
[1:54:37] as a process in the miracle had happened
[1:54:40] her eyesight was coming back her spirits
[1:54:42] was lifted things were changing the
[1:54:45] winds of change were happening and I
[1:54:49] announcer I just helped move to God
[1:54:50] we're gonna have a prayer line on winds
[1:54:52] tonight and I started a brother Wayne
[1:54:56] Lawson was here at that time and and he
[1:54:59] preached that night and he we prayed
[1:55:01] together and sister Karen was still in
[1:55:04] the process of being healing healed
[1:55:06] although there had been miracles already
[1:55:09] happened she was in my office laying in
[1:55:12] her in a little recliner or chair stuff
[1:55:15] Karen and and when I saw the Spirit of
[1:55:18] God moving I went really quickly and got
[1:55:21] that sufferer who was still having high
[1:55:24] blood pressure issues and bad just
[1:55:28] terrible headaches and that week and
[1:55:30] tottery suffer every month was led there
[1:55:34] and we we prayed with her in the prayer
[1:55:36] line and her hands went up oh man and
[1:55:41] she was healed
[1:55:43] stood up to midnight then weather
[1:55:49] hallelujah
[1:55:50] the suffering was over no more bed for
[1:55:53] her no more blood pressure no more
[1:55:59] headaches there was a message that the
[1:56:07] suburbs are going to be restored
[1:56:10] hallelujah
[1:56:11] a man she was to midnight praising God
[1:56:15] now some people have asked me I got a
[1:56:19] letter and honestly the gal wasn't too
[1:56:23] critical he just sent me a website were
[1:56:26] Satanists wear rings on their middle
[1:56:30] finger so that wasn't too critical and
[1:56:37] wondered why IRA wore a ring well it's
[1:56:41] not cuz I'm effeminate not cuz I'm a
[1:56:48] devil worshiper it's not cuz I'm trying
[1:56:54] to show wealth so why do you wear that
[1:56:57] ring brother Tim well I'll tell you when
[1:57:00] Karen and I got married in 1975 the only
[1:57:03] ring I could afford for her was a 98
[1:57:05] dollar ring her her dad asked me where
[1:57:10] did you get that from a gum machine the
[1:57:14] best we could do I thought it was a nice
[1:57:18] ring she was 17 I was 21 she bought me
[1:57:28] her parents actually bought mine this
[1:57:31] one on this hand for $48 just a little
[1:57:34] simple gold band by the time of our 25th
[1:57:39] anniversary you know and somewhere
[1:57:42] around that time my ring hats been so
[1:57:45] worn until it broke and she wanted to
[1:57:48] buy me another one and and
[1:57:51] and so we went and bought one you know
[1:57:55] it was more expensive than the other one
[1:57:58] but you know times had changed it wasn't
[1:58:00] even close to $1,000 it was still a very
[1:58:04] what they call him
[1:58:06] a cheap ring and and you know I it
[1:58:12] wasn't comfortable I put it on the
[1:58:15] finger and you roll around and dig into
[1:58:17] my finger and it wasn't comfortable and
[1:58:19] I didn't I didn't like it it irritated
[1:58:23] my finger so I went to the I went to the
[1:58:25] to a jeweler with my old ring and I said
[1:58:29] here can you fix this and they weld it
[1:58:31] back together and I put that ring back
[1:58:33] on I saw my original ring that feels so
[1:58:37] good and I took this and put it in a box
[1:58:39] and it's not there for years my wife had
[1:58:44] a brain bleed blinded her eyes took away
[1:58:48] her peripheral vision you people don't
[1:58:52] know how close that I come to losing my
[1:58:55] sweetheart other people had that same
[1:59:01] thing become a vegetable and died from
[1:59:04] it and so she had the brain bleed and it
[1:59:13] blinded her eyes and God healed and
[1:59:16] restored her eyes as I just told you in
[1:59:18] the testimony and after the brain
[1:59:22] believed it was due to the high blood
[1:59:24] pressure brought on by tremendous and
[1:59:26] emotional battle due to menopause she
[1:59:30] still had emotional battles with
[1:59:32] menopause for months outdoors it would
[1:59:36] be in Germany that I would feel led to
[1:59:39] go to to Germany and and speak in the
[1:59:43] meeting and it was in the Germany
[1:59:45] meetings that brother Ron also flew in
[1:59:47] for part of that meeting and as he was
[1:59:50] speaking he walked down the aisle and he
[1:59:53] said and you you just don't understand
[1:59:57] all of the dynamics that was going on
[1:59:59] you don't understand the turmoil of
[2:00:02] things that was going on you don't think
[2:00:05] think of the hours that I was there with
[2:00:07] ministers with different opinions and
[2:00:09] different things and certain things out
[2:00:11] and taking them to task on some of their
[2:00:14] stuff you know a lot of times you don't
[2:00:17] you don't see me in that mode but I know
[2:00:21] how to use the sword sometime I cut and
[2:00:26] sometime I spank with it but after all
[2:00:30] I've been along around the block a few
[2:00:32] times you don't maybe don't think of
[2:00:35] yourself as an elder but everybody else
[2:00:37] does because the most of them are
[2:00:40] younger than me so as I was dealing with
[2:00:44] some of this my wife was nervous and she
[2:00:47] was afraid and all of that and she went
[2:00:50] to room and she's crying all night until
[2:00:52] I was 2 in the morning coming in and
[2:00:57] don't you even question that yes I was
[2:00:59] victorious what do you think
[2:01:10] and I walk in the room and she's a
[2:01:12] basket case and I have to pray with her
[2:01:15] for some time until we finally give us
[2:01:17] sleep in the wee hours of the morning
[2:01:19] and that next day but the rod wasn't
[2:01:22] even there at that time the next day he
[2:01:24] comes in and he walks down the aisle and
[2:01:27] he pulls her out of the aisle he said
[2:01:30] sister Karen God healed you of that
[2:01:32] brain bleed and he delivered you of that
[2:01:35] blindness but said this God that we
[2:01:38] served then he started to work he's
[2:01:40] going to finish it and then he pulled
[2:01:45] her out and he prayed for her she stood
[2:01:47] I'm trying to get something to you
[2:01:49] sister it was an emotional moment from
[2:01:55] that moment she never had to have
[2:01:57] another hormone pill she was a man and
[2:02:22] she claimed her redemptive rights are
[2:02:26] you with me now
[2:02:27] I remember the emotion of the night same
[2:02:31] night of that prayer line when Justin
[2:02:35] came running to the church come to
[2:02:37] running down the aisles in his pajamas a
[2:02:40] wayward boy living out in sin you need
[2:02:44] anyone just noise and shouting it was
[2:02:48] God changing the life but that might
[2:02:51] have supper the man who had suffered in
[2:02:54] sin have a family that was suffering
[2:02:58] the whole family reunited and healed and
[2:03:02] delivered I'm trying to get something to
[2:03:07] your church man it may come with emotion
[2:03:10] but there's more than just some emotion
[2:03:13] you across the world you see the emotion
[2:03:17] but a lot of times you don't see what
[2:03:19] God's doing
[2:03:20] but I was you to understand there's more
[2:03:22] than emotion going on that's the power
[2:03:25] of God bringing people to stand on a
[2:03:28] promise happy healed
[2:03:30] I remember that emotion of the prayer
[2:03:38] line to when little Jed who had so many
[2:03:41] warts on his body a man about a five or
[2:03:44] six year old boy so many warts on his
[2:03:47] body the doctors had burned out nearly a
[2:03:49] hundred off of them and couldn't burn
[2:03:51] them all and he said you'll have to come
[2:03:53] back for a follow-up burned can you
[2:03:56] imagine the suffering of that child so
[2:04:00] many warts over his body but after that
[2:04:02] prayer line oh yeah it was an emotional
[2:04:07] moment but after meeting God after
[2:04:09] standing on the promise of after eyes
[2:04:12] and hallelujah had taken his position
[2:04:16] where our momma said we ain't suffering
[2:04:18] anymore we're not putting up with this
[2:04:20] anymore
[2:04:21] our suffering today is over
[2:04:25] hallelujah and God healed that boy
[2:04:27] without another side every bit of
[2:04:30] disappeared into water left his body
[2:04:35] hallelujah oh yeah I remember clearly
[2:04:42] the emotion of that morning when I was
[2:04:45] preaching on the revealing of sons some
[2:04:55] of you looking in on our services look
[2:04:58] over and see a little sister run around
[2:05:00] the aisle this morning because of what
[2:05:04] God's done in her life
[2:05:06] you don't know maybe what God's done and
[2:05:10] you just say that's emotion that was
[2:05:15] more than emotion but it's okay to be
[2:05:19] emotional don't you get happy when God
[2:05:23] gives you something
[2:05:24] we've got took this little woman that
[2:05:27] was dying with cancer a man that had it
[2:05:30] in her lungs are you with me
[2:05:32] somebody with me a man in here she ran
[2:05:36] around the building you got a glimpse up
[2:05:38] at this morning with long hair she
[2:05:39] football-headed when she come out of
[2:05:41] that mezzanine and run around this
[2:05:42] building just like that
[2:05:45] Oh God was revealing son that we were
[2:05:58] living in Bible days with Bible doctrine
[2:06:01] with Bible truth but for restoration
[2:06:05] she took that person for himself looks
[2:06:09] like you did the other day when that
[2:06:10] spirit of fear left it you don't have to
[2:06:13] fear anymore
