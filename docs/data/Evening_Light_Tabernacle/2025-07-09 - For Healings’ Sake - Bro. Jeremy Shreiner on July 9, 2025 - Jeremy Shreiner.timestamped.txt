[26:49] service. Father, we love you and praise
[26:51] you. And the church says, "Amen.
[26:54] Hallelujah." Do you really love him
[26:56] tonight?
[26:58] I believe that you do. There's none like
[26:59] him. Thank you. Did marvelous.
[27:01] Appreciate you very much. Amen. Uh as
[27:04] while we're standing, we just have one
[27:06] scripture, but if you wouldn't mind just
[27:08] turning to First John chapter 3. It's
[27:10] good to be back here again. It's been
[27:12] too long and uh we just uh my goodness,
[27:15] people have gotten married, more kids. I
[27:19] mean, they're just y'all are just
[27:21] awesome growing and just wonderful to
[27:23] see your faces and some that we've seen
[27:25] for a long time, some new ones. But we
[27:28] appreciate the opportunity to be here,
[27:29] brother Tim, and to be with you, and we
[27:31] appreciate the invitation. 1 John 3 22
[27:36] reads like this. It says, "And
[27:37] whatsoever we ask,
[27:40] we receive of him because we keep his
[27:44] commandments and do those things that
[27:48] are pleasing in his sight." God bless
[27:50] you. You can have your seats.
[27:54] And I know that I'm speaking to a
[27:56] perfect people. All right? I know that.
[28:00] I know that. But if you would bear with
[28:02] my folly tonight, and you may not be
[28:04] going through what the Lord's laid upon
[28:06] my heart tonight, you may not be
[28:07] battling it, but maybe something could
[28:09] be said tonight that would encourage you
[28:11] for if you ever face some of the things
[28:13] that we're going to deal with. So, I
[28:16] like to sometimes preface the sermon
[28:17] with that because a lot of times I've
[28:19] even done it myself where I'd be like,
[28:21] I'd shut off in the first five minutes
[28:23] because it has no relevance to my life.
[28:26] Listen, every time the minister gets up
[28:27] here, it's relevant to your life. It
[28:30] doesn't matter what it is, it's relevant
[28:32] to your life. So, I say, Lord, I I just
[28:34] want to hear from you. Amen. And I know
[28:36] that you're well taught, you're well
[28:37] verssed in the message, and you've got a
[28:39] wonderful ministry. So, just bear with
[28:41] us tonight as we we try to uh do what
[28:43] the Lord has laid upon our heart. We're
[28:45] going to take a thought entitled for
[28:47] healing's sake. And I know that's a play
[28:49] of words uh in a sense. You know, we've
[28:52] heard the statement for heaven's sake.
[28:53] And as I was dealing with this, the Lord
[28:55] just laid this upon my heart today, for
[28:57] healing's sake. Now, we know that
[28:59] healing comes in many different forms.
[29:02] Correct?
[29:03] You can have healing through music. You
[29:04] can have healing through the word as
[29:06] it's being ministered or whatever it is.
[29:08] Listen, as simple as a sunrise in the
[29:10] morning can heal your spirit. There's
[29:13] just something about How many How many
[29:14] knows what I'm talking about? A sunset
[29:15] at night, whatever it is. That's why we
[29:17] want to make sure that that we don't
[29:18] miss out on the small things that God
[29:21] has blessed us with. So, healing comes
[29:23] in different forms. Healing can involve
[29:25] also physical, mental healing,
[29:28] emotional, social healing, and and
[29:31] spiritual aspects of human experiences.
[29:35] And it is the aspect of mending. You
[29:37] have to allow God to mend your life.
[29:41] Now, we know that he is the healer. How
[29:44] many can say amen to that? And he is
[29:46] still in the healing business. And I and
[29:48] I want to deal with tonight. I know that
[29:50] we can talk about the physical the you
[29:52] know the fleshly healing of body. But we
[29:54] understand and I'll say this again a
[29:55] little bit later that this thing is
[29:56] cankering. It's dying and we're longing
[29:58] for a new body. Right? So, we know that
[30:01] God can heal this. But I believe a lot
[30:03] of times what we deal with is that
[30:05] spiritual or that uh uh mental healing
[30:08] that we need in our lives. Now I'm going
[30:10] to go to what brother Brandham says
[30:11] here. He says in spiritual food and due
[30:13] season. He says there's there's no
[30:15] strangers among us I suppose. But we all
[30:18] understand what healing is. You've
[30:19] already said that and it's nothing that
[30:23] somebody does for you, right? It's what
[30:25] God has already done for you. So
[30:29] salvation is on the same line, right? So
[30:32] the only thing is to get the people to
[30:34] believe that's the truth. And God
[30:36] teaches it in his word and then proves
[30:38] it to them who will believe it. For he
[30:41] said all things are possible to them
[30:43] that believe. Right? We still sing the
[30:46] song only believe. All things are
[30:47] possible. Right? Because you and I have
[30:50] tasted of the impossible becoming
[30:53] possible. Right? So you say there's
[30:55] nothing impossible with God. You believe
[30:57] that? says that's nothing impossible. So
[31:00] if there's nothing impossible with God,
[31:02] there's nothing impossible with you
[31:05] either. For all things are possible to
[31:08] them. See, God is one person to them
[31:10] that believe. See, so there's nothing
[31:13] impossible with you for you if you can
[31:17] only believe. Now, as we're reminded in
[31:20] the Psalm of the benefits of the
[31:22] believer, how many loves the benefits of
[31:24] a believer? There's no disease that is
[31:27] left out of his sight. We'll find that
[31:28] in Psalms 103:1-3.
[31:30] And it reads like this. It says, "A
[31:32] Psalm of David. Bless the Lord, oh my
[31:34] soul, and all that is within me, bless
[31:37] his holy name." How many loves that
[31:38] song? Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Why?
[31:40] For he hath done great things. Bless the
[31:43] Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his
[31:46] benefits. Who forgiveth all thine
[31:48] iniquities. Who health health all thy
[31:51] diseases. So the word of God gives us an
[31:54] example here that there is nothing that
[31:56] is hid from the healing presence of God.
[31:58] There is nothing that can be hid from
[32:01] his healing power. So as we're reminded
[32:04] of this that there is no disease left
[32:06] out of sight. We all believe those
[32:08] things. But here is the thing that God
[32:10] began to deal with me and has been for
[32:12] quite some time. Could there be
[32:14] something clogging lines of healing?
[32:19] Now I don't want to just again speak of
[32:21] physical but what we need most of these
[32:24] days is that spiritual and mental
[32:27] healings you see because it's the
[32:29] spiritual things and it's the mental
[32:31] aspect that a lot of times keeps us from
[32:33] going further. I I really want to take
[32:36] my time on this. See God desires
[32:38] wholeness of body for his people. Spirit
[32:41] body spirit and soul. How many believe
[32:43] that he desires wholeness?
[32:46] Body spirit and soul.
[32:48] He doesn't desire for you to have
[32:50] anything wrong, but we're going to go
[32:52] through things. Yet, many believers
[32:54] struggle to experience the fullness of
[32:57] his healing power. While we often focus
[33:00] on increasing our faith, we must also
[33:04] examine what must be hindering our
[33:06] healing.
[33:08] See, just as physical blockages can
[33:10] impede blood flow, spiritual and
[33:13] emotional blockages can impede the flow
[33:16] of God's healing power in our lives.
[33:20] See, you could even be here tonight and
[33:21] you could lift your hands and you can
[33:23] praise God, but there could be a
[33:25] blockage in our spiritual life. There
[33:26] could be a mental block somewhere that's
[33:29] keeping us from moving forward in the
[33:31] presence of God. I've done that before
[33:33] when I've when I've prayed for someone
[33:34] and they've come. It it's it's as simple
[33:37] as the rich young ruler knew where to
[33:39] go. He knew who to go to. He knew the
[33:41] right things to say. But there was one
[33:43] thing yet one thing thou lackest, right?
[33:45] There was one thing in his life that
[33:46] held him that held him from continuing
[33:49] on. Though you could call him a church
[33:51] member, you could call him a believer if
[33:53] you would because I mean Jesus said,
[33:55] "Have you done these things?" You know,
[33:56] the the commandments and all it says and
[33:58] he says, "I've done this from my youth."
[34:00] Right? And you notice Jesus never denied
[34:02] that. He never said, "Well, let's talk
[34:04] about that." You know, maybe this. No,
[34:06] he immediately went to the source. Yet,
[34:08] one thing you lack. And a lot of times
[34:10] us as believers, we get a really really
[34:13] spiritual and and and we get filled with
[34:16] with the books and we get filled with
[34:17] religion and and and then we forget that
[34:20] there is something inside of our life
[34:22] that is holding us back from actually
[34:24] breaking free and worshiping like we
[34:27] could worship and actually going to the
[34:28] house of God like we can go to the house
[34:30] of God. Not just yet you're here. Do
[34:32] something for me, preacher. Do something
[34:34] for me because I'm here. I mean that's
[34:36] what I pay you for anyways. I mean,
[34:39] that's not what it should be about.
[34:40] Anyways, I hope none of you ever said
[34:42] that. But, uh, it is quite possible that
[34:44] we thought it at some point in time. I
[34:46] paid you to do it. I mean, I don't have
[34:47] to do these things. No, God has called
[34:50] us all to be studiers of this message,
[34:52] studies of the word of God, and that our
[34:54] minds and our spiritual life is open for
[34:57] healing. So, our starting verse reveals
[35:01] a profound truth here. It says, "Our
[35:03] prayers are answered when we maintain a
[35:06] lifestyle of obedience." Now, we might
[35:08] not want to hear that. We think that I'm
[35:10] the bride of Jesus Christ and everything
[35:12] just should come and flow. It's like a
[35:13] silver spoon. That's not the way it is.
[35:15] God requires your obedience. Obedience
[35:17] is better than sacrifice. So, I'm glad
[35:20] that we go to church, but if we don't
[35:22] have a lifestyle of obedience, we're
[35:24] clogging up our spiritual lines. We
[35:27] might be religious. We might know God
[35:28] sent a prophet. We might even we might
[35:30] even be able to sit and have a good
[35:32] quote conversation. But where is the
[35:34] lifestyle? Where is the relationship?
[35:36] Where is the love that we should have
[35:38] with our brothers and sisters in the
[35:40] house of God? Again, it's reminding us
[35:42] and I'm going to read that again. And
[35:43] whatsoever we ask, we receive of him
[35:46] because this is the word, is it not?
[35:49] Because we keep his commandments and do
[35:51] those things that are pleasing in his
[35:53] sight. Now, I want to stop here and say
[35:54] this is not about earning God's healing
[35:57] through works. That's not what we're
[35:59] looking at here. We're not trying to
[36:01] earn his healing. It's already for you.
[36:03] That healing's already been set for you.
[36:05] It's open for you. So I This is not a
[36:07] scripture of earning it. I've got to
[36:09] earn my healing. I've got to I've got to
[36:11] go through the motions. I've got to do
[36:12] this. That's not what this is. But
[36:14] rather, it's positioning ourselves to
[36:17] receive what he's already freely given.
[36:20] So I How do I get into that, brother
[36:22] Jeremy? You position yourself in the
[36:24] free flowing line of obedience to his
[36:26] word of God. And a lot of times we put
[36:28] that to a man. So we just see the pastor
[36:30] or we see the evangelist or we see that
[36:33] and and we can't see past the flesh to
[36:35] see that God is trying to deal with our
[36:37] hearts to put us in a life of obedience.
[36:39] Not a life of religion. Not a life of
[36:42] I'm glad you're doing better. I'm glad I
[36:44] can trust you with my wallet. I'm glad
[36:46] you're no longer doing those things of
[36:47] the world. But where is the heart of the
[36:50] matter? Where is the relationship?
[36:52] Listen, a marriage would not be a good
[36:53] marriage if you can just say, "Well, I
[36:55] can trust her with my money.
[36:57] I mean, that's a good marriage, too.
[36:58] Don't get me wrong.
[37:01] But that there's something more to it
[37:03] than just saying, "I can trust somebody
[37:04] with my money or I can trust them with
[37:06] my car keys." No, there is a love
[37:08] relationship that even when things are
[37:10] going to go wrong, unless guess what? I
[37:12] don't care how much you love one
[37:13] another, you're going to have problems
[37:14] in your relationship, but that should
[37:16] draw you closer. And well, if I I
[37:18] figured if I came and I I went up to the
[37:20] altar and I got prayed for that all of
[37:22] the things would go away. No, those
[37:24] problems are still here. You're still in
[37:26] this life. You're still in this old
[37:27] coat. You're going to have to go through
[37:29] sicknesses and trials and people are
[37:31] going to step on your toes and things
[37:32] are not going to go the way you want
[37:34] them to go and this is going to happen
[37:36] and that's going to happen. But it's
[37:37] those tests of your life to find out who
[37:40] you really are.
[37:42] Where is the healing in our lives? So
[37:45] again, it's I want to position myself in
[37:47] the word of God. I want to position
[37:49] myself in his obedience and be obedient
[37:51] to his word. See, and by his word and
[37:55] his word alone, we can have faith and
[37:57] claim healing for ourselves because it's
[37:59] already done. We know the song, right?
[38:01] It's already done. The battle is over.
[38:03] You ever sing that song and be like,
[38:05] "The enemy begins to come in your mind.
[38:06] What do you mean the battle's over?"
[38:08] You're right in the middle of it, of
[38:09] course. But it's already over, Satan,
[38:11] for you.
[38:12] I'm going to keep I'm going to sing it
[38:14] even the louder. But you're right in the
[38:15] middle of pain. It doesn't matter if I
[38:17] feel pain. I am free. I am set free. I I
[38:20] I have listen he has already healed me
[38:22] and besides what I would rather enter
[38:24] into glory halt and lame and on a
[38:27] wheelchair because I know as soon as I
[38:29] get to the other side I won't be in a
[38:31] wheelchair anymore. I want to make sure
[38:33] that I'm so sold out in my life that if
[38:35] everything falls apart, if a world
[38:37] around me falls apart, I know that the
[38:39] word says he will not lose a one. No one
[38:42] can take me from the palm of his hand. I
[38:45] know this is simple, but I really want
[38:46] us to take this to heart because it's
[38:48] our humanity that we sometimes just look
[38:50] over and and we just think everything's
[38:52] going to be okay. And we want everyone
[38:54] to accept us for who we are. We want
[38:55] everyone to accept our our attitudes and
[38:57] we want everyone to accept our
[38:59] reactions. But I found out that when you
[39:01] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[39:04] something's going to change. Something's
[39:06] got to change. And it's not just a
[39:08] always an outside, but it's what's
[39:10] changing. Brother Jeremy, you begin to
[39:12] grow. You begin to learn. I shouldn't
[39:14] react that way. I shouldn't have that
[39:16] attitude. I should love my brother. I
[39:18] should shake their hand even if they
[39:20] don't shake mine. I should do these
[39:22] things. Why? Because there's something
[39:24] inside of you. Because when you were
[39:26] cursing God and you were spitting uh
[39:28] spitting in Jesus's face and putting
[39:30] those nails upon his hands, you said, "I
[39:32] didn't do it. We did it with our sins."
[39:34] He still said, "Father, forgive them for
[39:36] they know not what they do." And that's
[39:38] the same thing that should be in the
[39:40] bride of Jesus Christ. the same reaction
[39:43] to an action, the same thing. Because
[39:45] even in the church,
[39:47] people are going to be against people.
[39:49] I said this at camp. It gets to a point
[39:51] where the enemy doesn't have to do
[39:52] anything. He can just sit in the chair
[39:54] and cross his arms and say, "I don't got
[39:56] to do nothing, Brother Joe. They're
[39:58] doing it for me."
[39:59] No, that's not what we want to do, God.
[40:01] I want to get into the line of faith. I
[40:03] want to get into the line of obedience.
[40:05] See, Jesus would often say, "According
[40:08] to your faith." Then I was recently
[40:10] reminded of this quote and it just I
[40:12] just don't you just love when when a
[40:14] quote just explodes and you've read it
[40:16] the word even the word of God when you
[40:17] open it up and you've read it and read
[40:18] it but something just explodes. Amen. I
[40:21] hope that you do. Hallelujah. And
[40:24] perfect faith says now let us read. It
[40:26] says Jesus answering said unto them have
[40:28] faith in God. So we're going to read the
[40:30] scripture with him. says, "For verily I
[40:31] say unto you, that whosoever shall say
[40:33] unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and
[40:35] be thou cast into the sea, and shall not
[40:37] doubt in his heart, but shall believe
[40:39] that those things which he saith shall
[40:41] come to pass, here it is, he shall have
[40:44] whatsoever he saith." How many still
[40:46] believes the word?
[40:47] So therefore, I say unto you, what
[40:50] things soever you desire when you pray,
[40:53] believe that you receive them, and you
[40:54] shall have them. And when you stand
[40:57] praying,
[40:59] what is this still in the word?
[41:03] When you stand praying, forgive.
[41:07] If you have ought against any, that your
[41:10] father also which is in heaven may
[41:12] forgive you your trespasses.
[41:16] I want to remind you that you've had
[41:18] trespasses and that your heavenly father
[41:20] forgave you. Now, in turn, I ministered
[41:23] this at camp, the uh uh the ministry of
[41:25] reconciliation.
[41:26] This is a ministry that was given to all
[41:28] of us. And a lot of times we want to
[41:30] come in. I'm trying to get off of this,
[41:32] but I I'm I'm here now. I might as well
[41:34] just finish it. All right. I mean, so a
[41:36] lot of times we come in. What did he
[41:37] say? He says, when you come, he says,
[41:39] and and you come and you bring your gift
[41:40] to the altar, and yet you have something
[41:42] in your heart, you have honor, whatever.
[41:43] He said, what did he say? Leave that
[41:44] gift at the altar and go out and make it
[41:47] right. And so how much important was it
[41:50] for Jesus to say your gift, your worship
[41:53] does nothing for me
[41:56] until you take care of it with your
[41:59] brother or sister?
[42:01] How many times have I come into the
[42:03] house of God all lifting my hands,
[42:04] magnify the Lord with me, and yet
[42:06] something and I know I I know this is
[42:08] funny, but yet then all of a sudden
[42:10] somebody walked into the church and I
[42:11] just had this shudder.
[42:15] How many times have we shuddered?
[42:17] when somebody walked in. Why? Because we
[42:20] remembered something or something of the
[42:21] pastor. We still have something that
[42:23] that happened 30 years ago or even
[42:26] yesterday. It doesn't matter what it is.
[42:28] Jesus said your worship, your gift is
[42:30] nothing unless that is taken care of.
[42:33] And here we find when you stand praying,
[42:36] forgive.
[42:37] I can say God help me.
[42:40] Help me, Lord. I I don't want to just
[42:42] preach a sermon. God, help me to live
[42:44] forgiveness. Help me to live
[42:45] reconciliation. Help me to be the the
[42:48] the brother. And you know what Satan
[42:50] does? Oh, he'll fight me, too.
[42:53] He'll fight you.
[42:55] He'll fight these brothers.
[42:58] And then he'll
[43:01] Before you know it, you'll be spinning
[43:02] tires before you even leave the church.
[43:06] Hallelujah. Anyhow,
[43:08] don't let the devil get you down. That's
[43:10] a song, too, that's still active.
[43:14] But if you do not forgive,
[43:18] neither will your father which is in
[43:21] heaven forgive your trespasses. So what
[43:23] does brother Brandham say? He says, "Now
[43:24] faith is based on forgiveness." I know
[43:28] you know this, but let it be in our
[43:30] heart. Faith is based on forgiveness. So
[43:34] we can try to get all kinds of faith
[43:36] built up and build up faith and but yet
[43:38] if there's no forgiveness in our heart
[43:40] our faith is not.
[43:43] You see if we cannot forgive then how
[43:46] can we have faith for our own healing
[43:49] what begins to happen is is we then
[43:52] begin to open the door to spirits
[43:56] that begin to disturb our spirits. Now,
[43:59] you might be on your road to glory and
[44:02] you might be signed, still delivered,
[44:03] and you can still have disturbing
[44:05] spirits in your life.
[44:08] You might could have the cleanest of
[44:10] homes and still have a disturbing spirit
[44:12] that is proddding at you and probing at
[44:14] you. Right? We may not desire the world,
[44:18] but somehow become content with allowing
[44:21] these spirits to poke and prod us, thus
[44:25] disturbing the flow of the Holy Spirit
[44:27] in our lives. And when we start to flow
[44:30] in the the house of God and worship
[44:32] begins to move and and God begins to do
[44:34] and it's something all of a sudden
[44:36] because of that disturbing spirit
[44:37] because of the lack of forgiveness.
[44:39] Satan knows exactly when to go.
[44:44] He knows the moment when the word of God
[44:46] is coming. And listen because I believe
[44:48] he's got somebody reading these notes.
[44:52] And he knows what you're dealing with
[44:53] and what you're battling. And when
[44:55] brother Tim's up here and all of a
[44:56] sudden he's fixing to jump all over your
[44:59] life. You've never done that, have you?
[45:06] Here comes that disturbing spirit.
[45:09] That begins to help you miss it.
[45:11] What's it for you? And then we leave
[45:13] that place and go, "That was that was a
[45:14] mighty good sermon. Yeah, that was
[45:17] really good." Listen, not every service
[45:19] we walk out feeling like it was really
[45:21] good.
[45:24] because it kind of stung a little bit.
[45:28] That's Listen, if the word doesn't
[45:29] challenge you,
[45:32] then what are we doing here in the first
[45:33] place?
[45:34] If the word of God being ministered from
[45:36] the pulpit doesn't bring a challenge to
[45:38] you in your life and your home life and
[45:40] your job life and your family life and
[45:42] your kids' life, then something's wrong
[45:44] somewhere. No wonder all hell's against
[45:46] this.
[45:47] It doesn't want you to be challenged for
[45:50] your life.
[45:51] Oh, I got to hurry up. Tell me to hurry
[45:53] up. All right.
[45:55] Okay, that works, too.
[45:58] But if we hold a grudge,
[46:01] we can hold back our healing.
[46:03] Whether it be spiritual, mental, or
[46:05] physical.
[46:07] See, what is a grudge? It is a
[46:08] persistent feeling. I I'm dealing with
[46:11] the human aspect. Why? Because I last I
[46:13] checked, you're still human, and so am
[46:15] I.
[46:16] Hallelujah. How many wants to go to
[46:18] glory?
[46:19] All right. Well, then sometimes we got
[46:21] to make sure these spirits are not in
[46:23] our lives to help us. I mean, you might
[46:26] be going, but why would you want to live
[46:28] this kind of life? Why would you want to
[46:30] have the these disturbing spirits all
[46:32] over your life all the time? I think
[46:34] that we are living under our privileges.
[46:36] I'm going to just say that I'm living
[46:38] under my privileges. God, make sure,
[46:39] help me, Lord, to not have a grudge in
[46:41] my life. A persistent feeling of ill
[46:43] will or resentment resulting from past
[46:49] insult or injury.
[46:52] What is the word resentment? Resentment
[46:53] is a buildup of negative emotions such
[46:56] as anger. No.
[46:59] Frustration, never.
[47:01] And disappointment.
[47:04] Disappointment's all right. But is it? A
[47:07] lot of times we're looking for our own
[47:09] things and we constantly are
[47:10] disappointed because we're not in the
[47:13] will of God
[47:14] and then we begin to look at everyone
[47:16] else's life
[47:17] and because well they got it and I
[47:19] didn't. We begin to resent it.
[47:22] We begin to have ill will. All right. So
[47:25] it's when you are offended by someone or
[47:27] something in life and you allow that
[47:29] hurt to germinate in your heart. You
[47:33] don't see it but it's there. And then
[47:36] when it's germinated in there, then it
[47:37] begins to grow. It begins to take root.
[47:41] And it's characterized by an unforgiving
[47:44] spirit, negative, critical attitudes,
[47:47] and a slow, seething, abiding
[47:51] kind of anger. Just it's it's there.
[47:55] It's like a it's like a trickle of
[47:57] water. You know, that rock is pretty
[47:59] powerful, right? But after a time, that
[48:02] water just just it could be the smallest
[48:05] trail of water
[48:07] and it begins to erode that rock. I
[48:08] mean, we got to get a jackhammer,
[48:10] Brother Tim, and break that rock up, but
[48:11] you just take a little trail of water
[48:14] after a period of time. Might not seem
[48:15] like nothing, but it begins to erode
[48:17] that rock. And that's what that
[48:19] disturbing spirit is. Sometimes it's not
[48:21] that big old ugly devil that jumps in
[48:23] front of you, but it's just that slow
[48:25] seething uh negative spirit that just
[48:28] begins to erode our spiritual lives.
[48:31] And then it just Listen, I hope you
[48:33] understand what I'm going to say. It
[48:34] just becomes easier to not.
[48:38] There you go.
[48:39] You fill in the blank.
[48:41] It becomes easier and easier to just
[48:44] not.
[48:45] That's right.
[48:46] And we don't even realize that we have
[48:49] walked into that. We have justified it
[48:52] by the past.
[48:54] Notice what brother Brandham says here.
[48:56] And listen to what he's saying here.
[48:58] Says, "See, if you get a resenting
[49:00] audience,
[49:01] the Holy Spirit won't even reveal."
[49:05] Says, "You got to have something that's
[49:07] working together." They were in one
[49:09] place and in one accord. And then you
[49:11] then there came a sound from heaven
[49:12] rushing. See, no matter Oh, listen. No
[49:15] matter how much I'd pray and lay day and
[49:18] night studying and praying before the
[49:20] Lord and walk down there, maybe the
[49:24] anointing on me.
[49:29] Well, that was a flop tonight. What? Did
[49:31] you not pray good enough, Brother
[49:32] Timothy?
[49:35] Notice what the prophet is saying. Thank
[49:37] you for letting me use you. Notice what
[49:39] the prophet is saying here. He could
[49:40] pray. The anointing could be on these
[49:43] brothers. He could do everything and
[49:45] spend all their time studying. But if
[49:47] there's a resenting audience, resentment
[49:50] in that audience,
[49:52] says it just grieves him right away.
[49:57] He won't reveal nothing. Says, but when
[49:59] you walk down here under the anointing
[50:01] and fill your audience under the
[50:03] anointing, that's when the Holy Spirit
[50:06] begins to work then and he begins to
[50:08] move and do great things for us. That's
[50:11] the importance of coming to the house of
[50:13] God and praying, "God, get wash the dust
[50:16] of this life off of me. Wash the filth
[50:18] of this. I I the things that I didn't
[50:20] even want to see or the things that I
[50:22] didn't want to hear." Just literally
[50:24] walking through the dirt of this life
[50:25] that is God on me. Lord, wash it off. I
[50:27] don't want any resentment in my life. I
[50:29] want to make sure that the anointing is
[50:31] moving in this place because you don't
[50:33] know when there'll be a soul that'll
[50:34] come in there that'll need that
[50:36] anointing. And we create an atmosphere
[50:39] by getting the resentment off of us.
[50:41] That's right.
[50:44] See, what does it do? It says,
[50:45] "Resentment causes us to desire the
[50:47] worst for someone without even realizing
[50:50] it." I'm going to read you this story
[50:54] and I don't know where this is from. So,
[50:56] I I I looked it up and it says Pastor
[50:58] Ram. So, I'm not trying to plagiarize
[51:00] anybody, but this is I got this offline.
[51:02] It says, "Two shopkeepers were bitter
[51:05] rivals." So, their stores were directly
[51:08] across the street from each other, and
[51:09] they would spend each day keeping track
[51:11] of each other's business. And if one got
[51:14] a customer, he would smile and triumph
[51:17] at his rival.
[51:19] One night, an angel appeared to one of
[51:21] the shopkeepers in a dream and said,
[51:23] "I'll give you anything you ask, but
[51:26] whatever you receive, your competitor
[51:29] will will receive twice as much."
[51:34] Would you be rich? You can be very rich,
[51:37] but he will be twice as wealthy. Do you
[51:41] wish to live a long and healthy life?
[51:42] You can, but his life will be longer
[51:45] longer and healthier.
[51:47] What is your desire?
[51:50] The man frowned, thought for a moment,
[51:52] and then said, "Here's my request.
[51:54] Strike me blind in one eye."
[52:00] Well, I know that that seems kind of
[52:03] odd, but how many times do we carry
[52:06] that?
[52:08] I didn't say that you're wanting that,
[52:09] but see, resentment can take us to
[52:12] places that we don't want to go. And
[52:14] here, this this man had the opportunity
[52:16] to have all the wealth and all the
[52:17] health that he wanted, but his concern
[52:20] was more about what his competitor was
[52:22] going to get.
[52:24] Come on. That's not what this message is
[52:26] about. We're here together. Listen,
[52:29] whatever God is doing, we're this
[52:30] message was to draw us together in this
[52:33] assembly and my assembly and other
[52:35] pastors assembly and draw us together
[52:37] and push out the resentment and push out
[52:39] all these things and wish the best for
[52:41] your neighbor.
[52:43] God, let them have a greater blessing
[52:45] than me. Let them be closer. I don't
[52:47] care as long as we're together in this.
[52:49] Lord, I want more of you.
[52:52] We can have that that spirit of jealousy
[52:54] which generally refers to the thoughts
[52:56] or feelings of insecurity, fear and
[52:58] concern or over a relative lack of
[53:01] possessions or safety. See, jealousy
[53:04] cons can consist of one or more emotions
[53:07] such as anger here again resentment,
[53:09] inadequacy, helplessness or disgust. And
[53:13] we go all the way back to the beginning
[53:15] and we see jealousy start at the
[53:16] beginning.
[53:17] And it all started at a church service.
[53:23] So here we are.
[53:26] We're at church.
[53:27] What's happening?
[53:30] Brother Brandham says that's exactly
[53:31] what took place at the very beginning as
[53:33] Cain and Abel, both boys here on earth.
[53:35] And when Abel offered unto God a more
[53:37] excellent sacrifice than Cain, and God
[53:39] vindicated Abel, boy, I tell you what,
[53:41] when God vindicates, why do other people
[53:42] get mad?
[53:46] Hello. Well, it didn't happen to me, so
[53:48] it must not be right.
[53:50] No.
[53:52] If God vindicates his word by bringing
[53:55] it to pass, we should all rejoice.
[53:58] But then we begin to find out who we
[54:00] are. When God vindicates someone else's
[54:03] life,
[54:06] think about it. You might be tested for
[54:09] that. God, you might be the one praying,
[54:11] God, show me, God, vindicate this. And
[54:13] God might come around and vindicate this
[54:15] individual's life first. Yeah.
[54:19] Then what will we do?
[54:22] Oh, I'm going to keep reading. It it was
[54:24] it caused jealousy with Cain because he
[54:26] was jealous of his brother and slew his
[54:28] brother. Well, brother Jeremy, I have
[54:30] never murdered anybody, have we? Like I
[54:32] said, you might not be fighting this,
[54:35] but don't drop our guard.
[54:38] It started right at the beginning that
[54:40] when the natural and the spiritual, yet
[54:43] Cain and Abel worshiped the same God.
[54:46] They both built the same kind of altars
[54:48] and they both worshiped the same God
[54:52] at the same church and the same altar.
[54:57] They just had a different sacrifice or
[55:01] revelation.
[55:03] You know what? I'm going to just go this
[55:05] way. What if somebody doesn't have the
[55:07] revelation you have?
[55:09] What are you going to do about that?
[55:12] They should be Oh my word. They should
[55:14] know. God, help me to live a life in
[55:17] front of them to encourage them. You
[55:19] know, I'm so thankful. There were times
[55:21] when I was low and I wasn't flying as
[55:23] high as I should have flown as an eagle
[55:25] that there was someone that dropped me
[55:27] some meat. There was someone that didn't
[55:29] kick me when I was down, but they
[55:31] dropped meat when I needed it. You know,
[55:32] God wants us to be meat droppers.
[55:35] He wants us to be those that are
[55:37] willing, not not the kind of not the
[55:39] kind of talk when we just put people
[55:40] down. Well, you should have more of this
[55:42] and you No, God bless this person. You
[55:44] know what? God bless you, my brother.
[55:46] God bless you, my sister. Aren't you
[55:48] glad there was somebody in your life
[55:50] that dropped meat just at the right time
[55:52] when you were as low as you could get?
[55:55] Think about this other uh story that I
[55:58] have says, there was a fable of an eagle
[56:01] which could outfly another,
[56:04] and the other didn't like it. So the
[56:07] latter saw a sportsman one day and said
[56:09] to him,"I wish you would bring down that
[56:11] eagle."
[56:13] The sportsman replied to that that he
[56:15] would if I can only have some feathers
[56:18] to put in my arrow. So the eagle pulled
[56:20] one out of his wing. And the arrow was
[56:23] shot but didn't quite reach the rival
[56:25] eagle. It was flying too high. This
[56:27] envious eagle pulled out more feathers
[56:30] and kept pulling them out until he lost
[56:32] so many that he couldn't fly.
[56:35] Then the sportsman turned around and
[56:37] killed him.
[56:40] My friend, if you are jealous, the only
[56:43] man you can hurt is yourself.
[56:49] It's from, I believe, from Moody's.
[56:52] So, how many feathers have we given to
[56:55] try to bring someone down? See, Proverbs
[56:58] 14:30 says, "A sound heart is the life
[57:01] of the flesh, but envy the rottness of
[57:05] bones." Otherwise, it is saying, "Peace
[57:07] of mind makes the body healthy, but
[57:10] jealousy is like a cancer."
[57:13] Why do you think the enemy wants to rob
[57:15] your peace and he's trying to use people
[57:18] around you to rob it? Listen, don't let
[57:20] anybody get between you and God. In
[57:22] fact, it's usually not anybody that's
[57:23] doing it. It's me, myself, and I. It's
[57:26] the one in the mirror. Brother Brandham
[57:27] even talked about it. It I don't know
[57:29] the words, but his greatest battle in a
[57:30] sense was himself.
[57:33] Well, if he said that, I say, I want to
[57:34] look at myself instead of pointing
[57:36] fingers at other people. It could just
[57:39] be me.
[57:40] There you go.
[57:41] But, you know, if it is just me, it's
[57:43] that much easier to fix it because all I
[57:45] have to do is surrender to him. I don't
[57:47] have to worry about you surrendering.
[57:48] That's between you and God. Why do I
[57:50] want to fix everybody else?
[57:52] just need to trust in what God has for
[57:55] me.
[57:56] So, how many how many feathers have we
[57:58] given? I say, "Lord, get me away from
[58:01] that sportsman.
[58:02] Get me away from that, Lord. Let these
[58:04] feathers grow back." Right?
[58:06] You see, how many's heard of the
[58:07] greeneyed monster which doth mock I
[58:10] think that comes from Shakespeare. It is
[58:12] the greeneyed monster which doth mock
[58:14] the meat it feeds on. You see, jealousy
[58:17] is a monster that destroys the very
[58:19] thing it claims to protect.
[58:22] We think jealousy is actually helping
[58:24] us, but it's actually destroying us. It
[58:27] mocks the meat it feeds on. Meaning, it
[58:29] ridicules and destroys everything it
[58:32] consumes.
[58:34] I'm going to ask you a question. Are you
[58:35] sure you want to be the bride? Because
[58:37] being the bride of Jesus Christ means
[58:39] that you have to crucify this flesh. And
[58:41] let me just say this, crucifying the
[58:43] flesh is more than just not cutting your
[58:45] hair and more than not just putting on
[58:48] the dress and more than not just being
[58:49] with the right people. But sometimes
[58:51] it's crucifying retaliation.
[58:58] If cru it is crucifying the human
[59:00] element of retaliation and retaliation
[59:03] comes in many forms.
[59:06] Yet to be the bride she must and I
[59:09] cannot stress this enough she's got to
[59:11] be the difference. We cannot be like
[59:13] every other church. We cannot become
[59:15] like every other religion. We cannot
[59:17] become like every other denomination or
[59:20] non-denomination denomination.
[59:23] We've got to be the difference. We've
[59:25] got to be the bride of Jesus Christ. And
[59:27] you will be tested by the human element.
[59:30] It's not about how much you know up
[59:32] here. It's not about how many quotes you
[59:34] know, but it's the life that you live.
[59:35] We want to quote the prophet, but let's
[59:37] live the life that he lived.
[59:39] Let's live the life. Listen, I'm so glad
[59:42] that God placed a man in in our
[59:44] generation, and I can call it a
[59:45] generation that lived a life of humility
[59:47] in front of me. I see it in the word of
[59:50] God by Christ himself. But then we had
[59:52] someone live it that when people went
[59:54] against him, what did he do? Bless them.
[59:58] God, let me bless them. Let me bless
[1:00:01] you. Even if I've got to crucify my
[1:00:03] ideas and crucify God, I want to just
[1:00:05] give everything to have that type of
[1:00:07] spirit
[1:00:09] for healing's sake. I need healing in my
[1:00:12] life. I need it in my spirit. I need it
[1:00:14] in my mind. I need it in my flesh. But I
[1:00:17] could be clogging it up because I'm
[1:00:19] holding something.
[1:00:21] And I have every right to. Brother,
[1:00:24] listen. I want you to understand. I have
[1:00:27] every right to hold it because it
[1:00:28] happened to me. It's the truth. I have
[1:00:31] proof. I have verification. I have
[1:00:33] recordings. I have this. Listen. But I
[1:00:35] sold my rights out when I said I do. I'm
[1:00:38] not a part of Leodysa. I've given
[1:00:40] everything to him. I've given my rights
[1:00:43] to him. Burn the tapes. Burn the
[1:00:46] thoughts. Burn those things and come
[1:00:48] back to the word of God so healing can
[1:00:50] actually take place. Your children need
[1:00:52] it. Your wife needs it. Your husband
[1:00:54] needs it. The church needs it.
[1:00:57] For healing's sake, it's there for us.
[1:01:00] walk under that healing presence, but
[1:01:01] you got to be willing to crucify your
[1:01:03] flesh.
[1:01:05] Say, "Father, I forgive."
[1:01:09] She's got to be the difference. Notice
[1:01:10] we find that in Esther. Brother Bram
[1:01:12] says Esther purged her heart before God.
[1:01:15] Walked up with a meek and humble spirit.
[1:01:18] A lot of times we take that as, "Well,
[1:01:20] that means I just got to be tater vine
[1:01:22] back and I just got to be a wimp."
[1:01:23] That's not what I'm saying. Stand upon
[1:01:25] the word of God. Sometimes you got to
[1:01:27] pull that sword and you got to stand
[1:01:28] upon that because the enemy is coming
[1:01:29] against you. That's not what I'm saying.
[1:01:31] Stand for this truth, but be careful
[1:01:34] that we don't become overzealous,
[1:01:37] right? You can do that in Walmart,
[1:01:43] proving your rights to everyone around
[1:01:46] us and before you know it, we just
[1:01:47] become the most stuckup Pentecostal
[1:01:49] people in the world.
[1:01:52] And no one wants to serve you.
[1:01:56] No one wants to bag your groceries
[1:01:58] because you showed up again.
[1:02:02] That's not the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:06] The world is dying for what? The lack of
[1:02:09] love.
[1:02:12] Listen, they're going to step on your
[1:02:13] toes. They're going to be against you.
[1:02:14] They're going to say all kinds of things
[1:02:16] against you. Who cares? They did Christ.
[1:02:19] It didn't stop him. Why? because he had
[1:02:21] one goal in mind. Brothers and sisters,
[1:02:23] if we can just come to one goal and get
[1:02:25] rid of all the other goals that are
[1:02:26] taking our time and taking our life and
[1:02:28] taking everything about us and you've be
[1:02:30] a good person. I'm not doubting that.
[1:02:32] But God, I want to have a relationship
[1:02:34] with you. I want to be so in love with
[1:02:37] you. And I can come to an oldfashioned
[1:02:38] altar sometimes, not always an altar of
[1:02:41] repentance, but come down and just say,
[1:02:42] "God, I just want to draw closer to
[1:02:44] you." And you can have that altar in
[1:02:45] your home. You can have that altar. Why
[1:02:47] do we wait for here to do that? God, I
[1:02:49] when I come to church, this is a
[1:02:50] hospital. I get that. This is a place of
[1:02:52] healing. But sometimes we need to come
[1:02:54] and we need to help out in that. We need
[1:02:56] to help out with the creating of the
[1:02:57] atmosphere. And God, you can't I'm not
[1:02:59] just waiting for the person sitting next
[1:03:01] to me. God, use me.
[1:03:05] What did it say that said walked up with
[1:03:07] a meek and humble spirit? I'm all right
[1:03:09] on time. I've I've lost it here. The
[1:03:11] church that's going to be the bride of
[1:03:13] Christ. That what did he say? What's the
[1:03:15] the church that's going to be the bride
[1:03:16] of Christ? one that's going to be meek
[1:03:17] and humble. Says, "Now remember Esther
[1:03:19] refused the world worldly adornment."
[1:03:22] And she took the spirit in her heart to
[1:03:27] go before the king.
[1:03:30] See, and the women today in the church
[1:03:31] that think she's going to get in because
[1:03:33] she's got more numbers, she's the best
[1:03:34] dressed crowd, she's got the biggest
[1:03:36] organization, the biggest church in the
[1:03:38] city, and things like that says you'll
[1:03:39] miss it a million miles if you're
[1:03:41] depending on that. It's a sweet, kind,
[1:03:46] reverent
[1:03:47] spirit to what? The word of God.
[1:03:51] My question is is how do you react or
[1:03:53] respond when the word
[1:03:56] is coming?
[1:03:58] And sometimes it's surgical
[1:04:01] and it comes in and it begins to cut
[1:04:04] things. I don't care if you've been in
[1:04:05] this 50, 60 years, it's still surgical.
[1:04:07] That's right.
[1:04:09] And you could just be started out on
[1:04:10] your road and it's still surgical.
[1:04:13] Right. So what did he say? It's a sweet,
[1:04:16] kind, reverent spirit to the word of
[1:04:18] God. Washed by the water of the word and
[1:04:22] the word in you. It's washing. See, the
[1:04:26] church needs a washing. A full gospel
[1:04:30] washing. That's right. Not just a part
[1:04:31] washing, but a full gospel washing.
[1:04:34] Cleaned up. Made new creatures in Christ
[1:04:36] Jesus. See, Jesus's bride is not a dirty
[1:04:38] bride. he wouldn't have his dirty bride.
[1:04:45] So why are we allowing yesterday to keep
[1:04:48] us from today's healing?
[1:04:52] See, past hurts, whether actual or only
[1:04:56] miragages, become present strongholds.
[1:04:59] We then begin to lose focus on his
[1:05:01] promises as we stay focused on the
[1:05:03] problem. We're actually allowing
[1:05:06] yesterday something that's already gone
[1:05:08] and it's passed to keep us from today's
[1:05:11] healing, even the very healing that we
[1:05:14] need now.
[1:05:16] And we need healing because we're human
[1:05:17] beings and we go through problems. Just
[1:05:20] living life, we need healing.
[1:05:22] I mean, lit literally no one can say
[1:05:24] anything against you and to you, but
[1:05:26] just living your life. You come to
[1:05:28] church and Lord, I need healing. And you
[1:05:30] might look like the most healthiest of
[1:05:31] individuals, but you need healing.
[1:05:35] There ain't nothing wrong with that.
[1:05:37] That's what we're here for. But we
[1:05:39] cannot allow that. See, Isaiah 43:18,
[1:05:42] and I'm I'm I'm hurrying up here, so
[1:05:43] just finish with this. Remember ye not
[1:05:46] the former things, neither consider the
[1:05:49] things of old. Behold, I will do a new
[1:05:52] thing. Now it shall spring forth. Ye
[1:05:54] shall know uh uh shall ye know it. I
[1:05:57] will even make a way in the wilderness
[1:05:59] and the river and rivers in the desert.
[1:06:02] You see, but if we keep thinking of the
[1:06:05] old things and we keep allowing those
[1:06:07] things
[1:06:09] to halt us from what God can do new for
[1:06:11] us today, well, no wonder we can keep
[1:06:14] only going so far. You see, healing in
[1:06:18] most cases needs to be for the spirit
[1:06:20] and the heart. Though this flesh will
[1:06:22] caner and fade, it is our attitude of
[1:06:24] the heart and the spirit that is in need
[1:06:27] of repair.
[1:06:29] Can I just say this? never be satisfied
[1:06:31] with just getting better
[1:06:34] because there's always room for growth.
[1:06:36] How many still alive tonight? If you're
[1:06:38] still here and you're still awake with
[1:06:39] me, how many is alive? So, if you're
[1:06:41] still alive, there's still room to grow.
[1:06:44] I mean, it doesn't matter who we are,
[1:06:45] there's still room to grow. And so, the
[1:06:48] question then uh brings us down to this.
[1:06:50] We are reminded in the scripture to to
[1:06:53] obey is better than sacrifice. So, where
[1:06:55] does the monster's defeat come into play
[1:06:57] here? When we feed jealousy,
[1:07:01] we give it power over healing.
[1:07:04] That's right.
[1:07:05] Isn't that amazing how we can keep that
[1:07:07] in our mind that we can actually give
[1:07:09] power over God's healing? Why? Because
[1:07:10] the Holy Spirit's timid. The healing is
[1:07:13] here for you, but we constantly push it
[1:07:15] away.
[1:07:16] Why? Because we've been feeding that
[1:07:18] jealousy monster or we've been feeding
[1:07:20] that resentment monster or we've been
[1:07:22] feeding all of these things, right? But
[1:07:24] when we starve it,
[1:07:26] Yes. Through the obedience to God's
[1:07:29] word, choosing love over envy, gratitude
[1:07:31] over complaint, and trust over
[1:07:33] suspicion,
[1:07:35] the monster then begins to die and
[1:07:39] healing begins to flow freely.
[1:07:43] But the more you feed it, what brother
[1:07:45] Brown talked about, the white dog and
[1:07:46] the black dog,
[1:07:47] right? Which one are you feeding the
[1:07:49] most? I mean, you can take that and you
[1:07:52] can say that that's not relevant.
[1:07:53] Listen, what are you feeding most? If
[1:07:55] you don't like that part, I will say
[1:07:56] this. What are you feeding more? Your
[1:07:57] flesh or your spirit?
[1:07:59] Right? So, I want my heart to to not
[1:08:02] feed the jealousy because it's easy for
[1:08:05] jealousy to just happen. I don't even
[1:08:06] have to train you to do it.
[1:08:08] You never had to train your child to
[1:08:10] lie, did you?
[1:08:12] They just didn't want that spanking. Is
[1:08:15] that still all right to say? I don't
[1:08:16] know. You didn't have to train them to
[1:08:18] to try to get around something. It just
[1:08:21] happened, right? It's it just it's just
[1:08:23] there. So these things that you're
[1:08:25] fighting, though you have the Holy
[1:08:27] Spirit in your life, those things will
[1:08:29] still come at you.
[1:08:31] I didn't say that you're living them. I
[1:08:33] said they're coming at you. But why do
[1:08:35] we want them to keep knocking on our
[1:08:37] door?
[1:08:38] Help us, Lord. I got to move forward. If
[1:08:40] the brother, last quote,
[1:08:43] if the brother, you think he's a little
[1:08:45] wrong, or the sister, say, 'Lord, never
[1:08:48] let me have the root of bitterness
[1:08:52] spring up because it'll affect him and
[1:08:55] it'll take the Christ right out of my
[1:08:57] life. See that poison acids of malice
[1:09:01] and jealousy and hatred, that will just
[1:09:04] take the Holy Spirit right away from
[1:09:06] you. It'll run him from the tabernacle
[1:09:08] here. It'll kill the spirit of God or
[1:09:10] drive it from here. It'll hurt your
[1:09:12] pastor. It'll do everything. See? Says,
[1:09:14] "Don't you do that.
[1:09:18] Just wax that much closer together.
[1:09:22] Take that buckle." As the brother
[1:09:23] testified and ministered here the other
[1:09:25] night about having a buckle, seeing it
[1:09:26] in a vision. See that buckles on the
[1:09:28] whole armor of God. Just pull on her.
[1:09:30] Tighten up. Move up close to one
[1:09:32] another. Love one another. Anyhow.
[1:09:36] Well, I know why he said anyhow. Because
[1:09:37] there's going to be things in our lives
[1:09:40] that we're going to disagree with and
[1:09:42] we're not going to see eye to eye
[1:09:43] because listen, you're probably almost
[1:09:45] all family here. Probably not. I'm just
[1:09:47] saying that. Just it just seems like But
[1:09:49] we are part of the family of God.
[1:09:52] And so we're going to see each other's
[1:09:53] faults. You're actually going to see
[1:09:55] people make a mistake here.
[1:09:57] It's true.
[1:09:59] It's going to happen. But love one
[1:10:01] another anyhow.
[1:10:03] Pray for one another anyhow.
[1:10:06] Aren't you glad someone prayed for you?
[1:10:08] See, talk nice about one another, say
[1:10:11] nice things about one another, and then
[1:10:14] God will bless you. You see, non could
[1:10:18] be healed, right? But he had to do it
[1:10:20] exactly how God told him to do it.
[1:10:24] But why, Lord? Why do I have to why do I
[1:10:26] have to love him? You need heard the
[1:10:27] whole thing. Didn't say I had to like
[1:10:29] him. Uh-uh. That's not how this works.
[1:10:33] You love them.
[1:10:34] I'm glad he loved me and liked me.
[1:10:38] Even in my sin, even in my fault, he
[1:10:41] cares for me,
[1:10:43] right? He cares for you. So, non had to
[1:10:46] do it by obedience seven times. So, let
[1:10:49] me ask you this. What healing do you
[1:10:52] need this evening? I'm not just coming
[1:10:54] talking about coming and going through
[1:10:55] the same motions every single time.
[1:10:56] Every single service, you got to come
[1:10:58] and you're praying for the same thing.
[1:10:59] Sometimes it's it will not sometimes all
[1:11:01] the time. It'll never work until you
[1:11:03] check what's in your heart. Say, "What
[1:11:05] is it that's holding me back from
[1:11:07] getting free?" These brothers can pray
[1:11:09] for you every service and every day. And
[1:11:12] you can have a text message thread and a
[1:11:13] WhatsApp thread that would burn the the
[1:11:16] the hide of the enemy, but it doesn't
[1:11:19] matter if you're still holding on to
[1:11:22] something.
[1:11:24] Is there something that we need to bring
[1:11:26] to the altar? Is there a fleshly desire
[1:11:28] that is eating away at us? Is there a
[1:11:30] negative spirit? Are there grudges? Are
[1:11:31] there hard feelings? Are there
[1:11:33] resentments? Do we need to finally shut
[1:11:35] that monster up once and for all in our
[1:11:37] life? Because the water of the word is
[1:11:42] here,
[1:11:43] right? It's here.
[1:11:46] And my my life is saying, God, my heart
[1:11:48] is saying, "Lord, don't let me go back
[1:11:51] to the old the old things of resentment
[1:11:54] and and complexes and and and all of
[1:11:57] these things that hold me back from what
[1:11:59] God wants me to do in my ministry. Satan
[1:12:02] will attack the minister to get the
[1:12:04] minister. Sometimes he'll attack his
[1:12:06] wife. To get the pastor, he'll attack
[1:12:09] the church, right? He'll do whatever he
[1:12:12] can to try to weaken the body. But
[1:12:14] there's got to be someone that has
[1:12:16] Listen, how many still believes in the
[1:12:18] gifts active in a church? And what is it
[1:12:20] that's there's there's got to be
[1:12:22] discernment. There's got to be wisdom.
[1:12:24] There's got to be knowledge that's here
[1:12:25] to be able to catch these things. Not
[1:12:27] just wait for brother Tim to call it
[1:12:29] out, but you've been called to be able
[1:12:31] to see these things if that is active in
[1:12:33] your own life. To be able to say, "I'm
[1:12:35] not going to let that spirit put its
[1:12:37] ugly head up in this church. I'm going
[1:12:39] to begin to pray. I'm going to begin to
[1:12:41] get a hold of God." And God wants to use
[1:12:44] you for that.
[1:12:46] I'm just nothing. I'm just this and I I
[1:12:48] don't do anything. You You are here. You
[1:12:50] are a part of this church. God wants to
[1:12:52] use you. Well, you just got to get out
[1:12:53] of the way.
[1:12:55] Say, "Lord, be it unto me according to
[1:12:59] thy word. Musicians, come now. Let's bow
[1:13:02] our heads."
[1:13:07] Lord,
[1:13:10] I pray Lord, if there's anything that
[1:13:11] was set out of the way, God, that you
[1:13:13] would just forgive me and look past,
[1:13:14] Lord, and that the seed found good
[1:13:17] ground.
[1:13:19] Lord, I want my heart changed, Lord. As
[1:13:22] the song is sung, change my heart, oh
[1:13:24] God. Make it ever true.
[1:13:27] Change my heart, oh God. I want to be
[1:13:30] like you.
[1:13:31] I'm sorry for being me.
[1:13:35] I'm I'm sorry for getting in
[1:13:38] getting in the way and not letting you
[1:13:41] be you,
[1:13:44] Lord.
[1:13:46] Maybe there's someone here tonight that
[1:13:48] say, "Lord, I I just want you to be you
[1:13:50] in my life.
[1:13:54] I'm tired of letting these things from
[1:13:55] the past
[1:13:57] or these things even from yesterday or
[1:13:59] even today just halt me
[1:14:02] from the healing that I can have in my
[1:14:04] life. Listen, Satan is brutal. I get it.
[1:14:08] He's brutal. He's never going to he's
[1:14:10] never going to stop. He's relentless.
[1:14:12] There's no intermission in this life.
[1:14:14] Let's get Let's get this this thing
[1:14:15] straight. There's no intermission in
[1:14:17] this life. No intermission.
[1:14:20] It's constant. The barrage is constant.
[1:14:23] But yet we can have peace
[1:14:26] surrounded.
[1:14:28] I've had people say, "How can you keep
[1:14:30] going with all that's going on?" I don't
[1:14:32] know. I don't have the answer. But yet,
[1:14:34] there's something that's holding me in
[1:14:36] my life, in my heart. There's a piece
[1:14:38] that passes understanding.
[1:14:40] But, Brother Jeremy, I'm just tired. I
[1:14:42] get it. We're tired.
[1:14:44] But we're almost home.
[1:14:47] Don't give up.
[1:14:50] Don't just don't just make it so easy to
[1:14:53] just not anymore.
[1:14:55] Say, "Renew me, Lord. Stir the gift up
[1:14:58] in my heart. Change my thinking. Change
[1:15:01] my ways, Lord. Get rid of that monster
[1:15:03] in my life." He says, "I want to, but if
[1:15:05] you you have to obey me, you can't just
[1:15:07] say something in this service and then
[1:15:08] walk out to the same old life." You've
[1:15:10] got to be persistent. You've got to have
[1:15:13] something in your heart that says, "I
[1:15:15] know I'm going to face trials. I know
[1:15:16] I'm going to face battles and
[1:15:18] difficulties, but thou art with me.
[1:15:23] Would you be honest with him? Not me. I
[1:15:25] I don't I want to be real with you. I'm
[1:15:28] not asking to pray for you. It won't do
[1:15:31] any good.
[1:15:34] It won't do any good unless your heart
[1:15:35] is completely open and say, "God, I just
[1:15:38] I'm done. I'm tired. You have exposed
[1:15:41] it.
[1:15:43] I'm tired of the excuses. says, "I'm
[1:15:45] tired of offering all these excuses of
[1:15:47] why I can't go any further and why I
[1:15:49] still hold on to this. I'm tired, Lord.
[1:15:53] I'm ready to be free."
[1:15:56] Maybe you're just going through a little
[1:15:57] battle and you just need a little bit of
[1:15:59] healing. And I still believe the great
[1:16:02] physician is here. She's playing it.
[1:16:05] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:16:07] Make it ever true.
[1:16:10] Change my heart, oh God. Listen, I'm not
[1:16:12] trying to work you up tonight. And I'm
[1:16:14] trying to get to your heart and I'm
[1:16:15] trying to get to your soul. I'm trying
[1:16:17] to get to your humanity. God is here
[1:16:19] tonight to meet it. But you've got to be
[1:16:22] real with him.
[1:16:24] Will you be real with him now? I want to
[1:16:27] give a few moments. I want to sing this
[1:16:29] song together.
[1:16:32] And I just want you to be I want you to
[1:16:34] be real reverent now.
[1:16:36] Even on a Wednesday night, God can
[1:16:38] simply change our hearts.
[1:16:42] Do you believe it tonight?
[1:16:44] Let's do this together. Change my heart,
[1:16:46] oh God. Change my heart, oh God.
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:53] Make it ever
[1:16:56] true.
[1:16:57] Do it, Lord.
[1:16:59] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:17:06] May I be like. Let's sing that part
[1:17:09] again. and change my heart. Be honest
[1:17:11] now. Change my heart,
[1:17:15] oh God. I don't want anything else but

[1:32:15] say, "Lord, I want to zig those lines

[1:33:19] gusher of the Holy Spirit and fill every
[1:33:22] heart. Fill this assembly.
