========================================

[Music] I'm not on an ego trip. I'm nothing on my own. I made mistakes and often slipped. I'm just calling for fish and bone. [Music] But I'll prove someday just what I say. I'm of a special kind. [Music] Oh, while he was on the cross, I was on his mind. The look of love was on his face, the thorns on his head. [Music] Wood was on that scarlet robe and it was stained crimson red. Though his eyes were on the ground that day, he looked ahead in time. For while he was on the cross, you were on his mind. [Music] Yet he knew me. Yet he loved me. [Music] [Applause] He whose glory makes the heaven shine. [Music] I'm so unworthy of such mercy. For while he was on the cross, I was on his mind. For while he was on the cross, you were on his mind. [Music] [Applause] And so I'll cherish the old rugy cross until my tr [Applause] I will cling to the old rocky wrong [Music] and exchange it someday for a crown and exchange it someday for her. [Applause]
