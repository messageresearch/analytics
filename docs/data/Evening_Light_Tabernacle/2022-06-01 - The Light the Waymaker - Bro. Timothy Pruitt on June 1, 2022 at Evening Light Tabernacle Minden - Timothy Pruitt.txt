come i'd like to read you this i'm just reading this today and just touched my heart mother brother ran him in a prayer he says oh how wonderful that a living father the very birth of eternity would come down to immortal beings and help us and would bring his word and give it to our mouths and our hearts and our ears that we might hear it and live to redeem us from a curse that we had nothing to do with it coming it was done by human race and we're offsprings of that first couple and yes we're born in sin and we're shaped in iniquity but a just and living god knows that we had nothing to do with that and has made a way of escape and give us the privilege of coming how glad we are we've come to the father's house hallelujah aren't you glad you come to the father's house aren't you glad he made you a way of escape escaping the evil day that we're living in and situations that we face whatever it may be let's go to him in prayer today father lord we just want to thank you lord lord you saw fit to come down and bring your word to us that would give us something to live on lord give us something to lord to move to higher heights and to greater depths lord father we can know have a firm foundation we can stand upon in a time that's being shaken all around us lord god we can look at your word and no lord you your word has never failed and it never will fail we thank the lord that we have been given the privilege of having a way of escape lord that one day we're going to leave this whole world behind and go to be with you for eternity what a day that will be lord lord this service will give it to you father everything to be said and done for your glory and your honor bless those that are away tonight lord travel in different places bring them safely home we pray we thank you for all that you've done among us lord in what you're going to do we ask these things in jesus name amen amen amen you can turn to psalms chapter 119 and 105 and also isaiah 43 and verse 16. says thy word is a lamp unto my feet and the light unto my path amen his word is not our feelings not our ideas not what we think or what we believe it's his word is the light amen also isaiah 43 and verse 16 says thus saith the lord which maketh away in the sea and a path in the mighty waters amen we'll let you be seated last time i was in this place i spoke on the light has brought you to where you are and tonight i would like to speak to you on the light the waymaker amen the light the waymaker you know uh brother branham would say in this sumerian church age he says cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had before us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so amen and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass amen so where we find his approval in our life you know many people are looking are desiring the will of god and and you know they're wanting to know if it's his will to do many things in their lives and that's a wonderful thing is to be in the will of god we always want to be in the will of god but the will of god is not our notions or our feelings or what we think or or what we we think think is right the will of god is his word and and if you're not in his word and what you're doing is not in his word well then it's not in the will of god amen but god has has a will and he has a way and he has a place that you can go to and you can pull from and and you can lean on and i'm thankful that we have this word in our this hour that we're living and and i'm thankful that we're not dealing with just a halfway truth or our halfway open book or maybe looking at a few scriptures but today we can say the book has been open and therefore we can see his will for the time that we're living in and we can see the things that amen that are going on daily amen is his will you know no matter how much we fuss about it and and want to uh get upset about it where we're at today the climate that we're in the political climate that we're in all the things around us has to be his will or it couldn't be coming to pass amen this is because it's in the word because this world has got to get an atmosphere for a burning it's got to get in a place a climate to burn amen because it's there in the word amen as this world would burn with fire amen so we know that when you go through things in life that does as we've read there's this gives us such courage to know maybe tonight you're in a great trial and you're going to see cloudy skies all around and and storms that are all around but that's not necessarily meaning god's disapproving your life amen but or maybe tonight you came and has been blue sky skies for a month or whatever has been going on that's not necessarily his signs of his love but where you want to find what his will is or who he is is in his word and we and we believe it because he said so he said he loved us he said he's he's made a way he says that he can do these things he said he's the same yesterday today and forever so it's all in his word and that's where we go to amen so when we get into trial when we get in a situation in our lives we can still have joy in the moment we can still have peace in the moment we can still have amen things in our lives can still be a solid a rock to stand on because we're not standing upon our feelings because you know our feelings will deceive us amen amen in good times our feelings are many times good and we're on the top of the clouds and everything's fine and hunky dory and we get in a cloudy moment and we get all worried and all fretted if we was we if we were if our foundation was upon our feelings where would we be why it'd be different one day to another one moment to another one minute to another it would be different but thank god his word never changes and this is where he says we have to place our confidence is not in our thinking not who we are not what we we think is right but in his word amen and when we go through the trials we can lean upon his word we know in his word it says there has no temptation taken you such is common to man but god is faithful hallelujah who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation make a way of escape amen that ye may be able to bear it amen i'm thankful for that scripture tonight that when i get in the middle of a trial i know it's not too much because god is faithful amen god is faithful he's faithful at all times amen you know we see his faithfulness when we re we witness healing and we witness a miracle and we say well god is faithful god is faithful every day of your life it doesn't matter if you're in the cloudy times in the dark times and bitter times and hard moments of your life god is faithful and god will not allow you to be tempted or to bear more than you're able but he will make a way of escape it might be right at the last moment it might be when you seem like you can't take another step but his word says he's going to make a way he's going to make a way of escape now you know in in the past there's always there's a right way and a wrong way you know and so when we make choices we can look at it it can be your way it can be my way and when we do that it's the wrong way come on now god's way is always the right way ain't no ifs ands or buts his way is always the right way it might not be the way we would like it might not be our favorite choice as far as what we can see and many times his way leads to some dark places and things you don't know how it's going to work work out but god's way is always the right way no matter how unright it seems to us no matter how hopeless god's ways are true they're past understanding god's working in mysterious ways his wonders to before but god will bring you to the place that he has ordained you if you will walk his way and it's not an easy way as we heard sunday it's a hard way it's a hard choice that you have to make sometimes in your life you don't know amen what's going to happen how it's all going to work out but if god has put something inside of you and it matches his word amen then you are on the right path and it will lead to the right destination but there's two ways a man can go and that's his way or god's way that's the right way or the wrong way our way is always the wrong way god's way is always the right way and you can't be in your own way and in god's way at the same time it's two opposite directions amen but god has a way he has a provided way you know in the garden of eden as we as we get into this amen god made a man so brother brown would call it that he didn't have to shift for nothing or he didn't have to work he didn't have to he didn't have to work by his hands and toil in the fields and he could just speak the word and it would take place he could speak things into existence he had the power of the spoken word and he had that what a what a place to be but he said see man is always trying to tamper with what god has done he's always wanted to try to maybe find a better way and we find that that we're not going to get into all of the details but we find man false what does he do he doesn't wait for god to make him a religion he makes his own religion that's when the first religious spirit entered in and he began to make his own way and he began to try to build his own uh his own covering and out of fig leaves and do everything how he had to do it how he wanted to do it see he's always trying to make himself something instead of waiting on god he said but god had made him one and we find out that when his religion wouldn't work god came down in the garden in the cool of the evening amen the light came and made a way amen it made a way it killed a lamb and it brought a provided way of sacrifice that that man could come to god again amen the light made a way when fig leaves couldn't make a way man's creeds couldn't make a way man's ideas couldn't make a way the light made a way amen there's been many people that's come down into the world road and they realized their little shallow religion and things that they thought were right and things they kept amen as their own little personal things they found out it didn't work no more amen nothing short of being born again will ever work amen there's no man-made thing in this day that's going to keep us alive [Music] this world's headed towards nuclear destruction it's prophesied in the bible it's not something i'm saying it's something that's been prophesied hundreds and even thousands years ago but it's laying there and it shall come to pass and we see it day after day more and more is being talked about it more and more is being pushed more and more is going out there and they're training now they're putting it back out and they're showing their missiles and they're they're showing everything that they got amen you know russia comes out and they do a parade amen next thing you know the abc news flies a woman out on a helicopter and she goes drops off on a submarine out there in the middle of the ocean and they show her all the nuclear warheads they got this world is going towards destruction and there's nothing manmade that's going to get you out of it it couldn't get adam and eve out of it in the beginning and nothing man-made will get you out of it now the only thing that will get you out of here is being born by the same light of god that fell on the day of pentecost a 120 people in the upper room and they came out amen is drunk men and moved by the spirit of god you will have to have that same light to live and live throughout eternity there's nothing no other way you can't make it no other way you can try you can read your bible you can quote the quotes you can live the perfect lives you can do whatever you want to but unless you have been born again by the spirit of god you don't have a way out of here amen but you know you have to die to be born again but then you move on to cain he tried to make his own way you know he had some apples and some pears and peaches and some pumpkins and things he laid up on the altar and said wow here's a good place i built an altar i have a church i've been a good church member i go to church every day i built it i put a sacrifice now i'm going to kneel and play now lord i want you to receive me but god refused him what was it was the same old religious spirit lives right now today just as religious as it can be but knows no more about god than anything else he said you know that's the truth religious spirits religious spirits the bible said those two spirits would be so close but it would deceive the very elect if it was possible and the only reason why it ain't possible because he put it there and says it's not possible amen but my light will shine greater my light will shine brighter my light will give them a path to walk down my my light not their feelings not their thoughts but my light we find out that judas iscariot went out and rejoiced he preached the gospel came back hollering shouting having a big time with the rest of the disciples he baptized he cast out devils he done it all saint matthew the 10th chapter says that and he followed the disciples right along yet the incarnated devil and come right along and jesus was the incarnated god cain and abel judas and jesus amen the right and the wrong way but he came up to his time at pentecost and he showed his true colors he said when you go to talking about being born again receiving the baptism the holy ghost nine times out of ten them spirits will begin to show their colors and say well that's just a bunch of fanaticism i just leave it that's the wrong way brother that's god's provided way for every man woman boy and child today god has always made a provided way he's under obligation to make a way so if he says you have to have the holy ghost he has to have a make a way that you can receive the holy ghost if he says in his word he's a healer then he has to make a way amen that you can be healed hallelujah if he says in his word he's a deliverer he has to make a way for you to be able to be delivered or otherwise amen his word is it just comes from void and no it has no power to it amen but he will watch over his word and he will bring it to pass and he will make a pathway where there seems to be no way he'll open doors he'll do whatever he'll get you in the right atmosphere you know i think about how even little seeds put in the ground and he had put he'd put in his word every seed shall multiply and and so that he had to make a way for that to happen or his word would fall short amen so he puts the seed in the ground and he puts the right out soil there he puts the right atmosphere the sun begins to shine the waters fall upon it what is it it's making a way for that seed to come up amen so his word will not fall forth listen every time you see a blade of grass come out of the ground that's god's word being fulfilled amen when you see the the things of nature taking place that is god's word being fulfilled and i think about that if he had promises in his word amen of the laodicean believers and he promised there were seeds laying down there he would have to make a way for them to come up he would have to create the right atmosphere he would have to have the right minerals and the right dirt and the right things amen so that word could be fulfilled and so that seed and laodicea and all down to the dark ages every church age had a promise to him that overcometh to him that overcometh so that for him to say that he had to make a way for someone to overcome this age will not be without an overcomer there will be a people that overcomes why his word says there will be god always makes a provided way god's under obligation he's tied himself to his word he's a waymaker but man goes to messing with nature and they cut down the timbers and they do this and they do that and it causes issues in nature and they want to call it acts of god it was actually acts of men you know i was just some time ago we me and brother tim got to visit the area again just a few weeks ago they're in banff but me and my wife was up there for a 15th anniversary and uh we was on a boat on a lake and on one side the lake was this forest that had been burnt and there was trees laying down and but you could see the young growth coming out and on this side on the other side of the lake was this beautiful hundred and year or thousand who knows how oh just uh uh virgin timber standing there and the great beauty and his great things and and the man says you know he said this is amazing he said as we go down this lake he said i want to point out something he said how where do you think there's life he said where do you think there's life and people were pointing over these beautiful trees and and said there's got to be life he said actually he said 95 to 97 of the bears and the deer and the life are over there where it's been burnt and it's been he said because that is how nature does it replenishes itself by fire and fire comes down by lightning or or something takes place to cause it to ignite it and it burns down to a valley he said the reason why this side hasn't burned he said because men watch over it and they put every fire they can out he said because right up the end of that is a man-made village called banff and if that hill burns bounce gonna burn he said but the live the life is over there where the fire had burns man i might have me a shout and spit spell right there on that boat i said i'm going to trump this thing over if y'all ain't careful because i can see amen people that have built pines they places and they've got amen they look like fine trees and they look like this amen but they have not allowed the spirit of god the waymaker to come into their church they mean to burn out the old creeds and the old dolphins and all the things and over here there's life popping [Applause] amen there's life and it's giving birth and things are taking place meanwhile amen people are worried about their structures and they're worried about their things that they have built and they're worried about their own kingdoms being burnt down i want the waymaker i want him to come and do what he has to do so life can come to the body but you interfere with nature and floods begin to happen and they build up dams you know they remember that tim just spent a time on a was a was a river at one time now they've dammed it up in about three different places 100 mile lakes places that when he was out on the boat the guy says you actually have had the right sonar equipment you can see villages that they actually uh drive put underwater under there when they when they flooded this and some places in this lake are over a thousand foot deep he said but the problem is this year we've had a lot of rain this year we've had a lot of snow and just he said up on the mountains about 30 to 40 foot of snow he said i've actually been up there he said they got these little gps things i'm on my my snowmobile or on my skis whatever he said i'll mark he said it looks like that tree's about that little tree coming out of the snow about that tall he said i'll mark it with my gps and i'll go back a little later when the snow is melted and that thing i was actually up that tree about 40 to 50 foot i said us boys in the south don't know anything about that thank god he said but the problem is we put these dams here and he said the melt's about to happen and now all the rain that we've had he said flooding is about to take place amen what is the insurance going to call it an act of god no it was the act of men amen messing with nature messing with the creation of god amen and you know i see how god has built his church and he's built it in a certain way he wants it a certain way but men come and they put dams there they put their own ideas there they build camps there amen that's not what god wants he wants the water to fro freely amen not damn it up not try to hold it back but let the spirit of god the waymaker find his way down through every crevice down through every part if he wants to take a right turn let him take a right turn he is the leader he is the god i think about the children of israel they came out of egypt no wonder they got a little confused they know the red sea was right over there pharaoh knew the red sea was right over there but god said i'm gonna go this way and i'm gonna go that way and i'm gonna go this way because i want pharaoh to say hey they're lost they're entangled in the wilderness he said i'm gonna do this i want you to walk with me and moses i want you to walk with me children of israel because i'm setting a trap for your enemy i'm setting a trap so i can have my full amen my full of victory over pharaoh and his army listen laodicea has been built in a certain way god has went certain paths listen we didn't think we'd go this far for 50 or 60 years past the prophet but we are still following the light and the light is setting satan up hallelujah he's the waymaker he's making a way for you but he's making a destruction for your enemy amen he's going to bring them to their death yes my god i'm i don't know about you but i'm getting excited amen because i'm seeing a little glimmering glistening and going on over there what's that i see over there i smell water we've been in this wilderness we've been walking out of egypt we've come out of egypt a long time ago but here we are and it's time to cross over it's time to move over into another place and god's been making the way the whole time the light led them though you read in the scripture the pillar of fire led them out of egypt it led them through the wilderness it led them to the red sea it led them through the red sea it led them tomorrow they meant to bitter waters it led them to a place that had nothing to drink nothing to eat but it led them to a rock and led them to quail and led them to oasis it led them and led them and led them and led them they complained they fussed they made they said well we got a better way we got a shortcut hey there they but they had to follow the light if they was ever going to make it to the promised land and they were joshua and caleb were still there as they got ready to go over the jordan oh my 40 years ago we could have had it 40 years we was here but here we are again and i'm ready to mush to push across i'm ready to go to the other side and joshua goes over there to try to search it out and what happened a light began to form i would say it was an amber light it began to come down and move in those trees and out of that light stepped a man it was about six foot tall olive compact complexion with a sword in his hand the light had led him to this moment and led him to this place had led him right here where he was you know it's pretty amazing you preach something one night next day you get up and you live it quite amazing last wednesday our priest the priest on the light has brought you to where you are me and brother tim get on the plane the next morning we fly to atlanta we got about five hours in atlanta so we thought well we're going to the delta lounge there it's a little quieter we can hook our computers up and fellowship and study whatever we get off the plane i asked the guy where our gate was he said well you're in second here and you're in d said you got to go down the other end of the d i said okay i said where's the lounge he said well there's one right across here or you can go down there's one down by your gate i said well we've been on the plane remember tim decided to walk we walked down to the one that was by our gate to go out walk in we thought that that we could get him for free we found out we had to pay a little money and so we discuss it like i i don't know if i want to give that and so we walk out and we go up go back and say well let's go back to the main center of the place and find something to eat well by the time we got there we said well by the time you eat and i eat that's half the cost by the time we get a coffee later and this that and the other we might as well just go into the lounge so we go back to the original gate that we flew out of and we go in and we paid our i think it was like 39 bucks a person we walk in and i walk around the corner and i'm looking for a seat for both of us and i'm i'm eyeballing where's the good seat and i look back and brother tim's not behind me and i i look at him he's talking to somebody i look he waves me over and i go over there to where he was at and look around the corner at this little desk there's berry coffee sitting there the light had led me to where we are i thought i was just thinking how many times you get up that way sometimes you thought well i'm just thinking i'm just thinking i'm going to do this i'm thinking i'm going to do this and meanwhile the light is actually leading you pulsations are taking place and you're moving this way and that way and there you are all of a sudden you're standing you realize wow if we'd have went down there and we'd sat there for five hours and we'd never saw him until he got on the same plane with us and went the same place we were going and sat in the seat right behind me the light had led us to where we were amen god orchestrating things amen you can look it in nature you can see it in ducks ducks amen are down down into south louisiana it gets a little hot and muggy and they start heading towards the north and they get up in the north and they they have their hatchlings i've been up there in alaska and it'd be thousands on thousands of tops just unbelievable almost turned to sky black up there in the in the summertime as they're they're nesting and they're they're having their babies and things that and then and they're quacking and it's just thousands unbelievable but all of a sudden a little snowflake will begin to fall and a little temperature begin to change and all of a sudden out in the middle of that lake a duck will start quacking and all of a sudden the rest of those ducks will get after them and start quacking with them and they'll lift up off that pond and they'll begin to head back to south and down to louisiana and arkansas down to some rice field down in the sun down for the winter and i thought my ain't that amazing that in a dumb duck god could put such an intelligence inside of them that when the the seasons start changing things start happening it's time to start getting ready to get out of here and i thought if god could put that in a duck how much more can he put that in a human being when they see seasons they're changing times are changing amen the world's changing this ain't no place fit to live in anymore amen is that what is it it starts happening inside of us and there's a call coming to another land [Music] and it won't be long as we gather together we'll lift up all this place and go into eternity back where we belong but what did that does that the light he's the waymaker listen the reason you're here tonight god made a way the reason you was able to rise above the muck pile of the world and the sins of this world god made a way the reason you didn't take your life at a young age or take your life even this week god made a way the reason you're able to do the things that you do and even live the life that you live god has made a way seems like christians ought to have duck sense at least it's time to get out of here the handwriting's on the wall you want to call it male adjust the instinct no that's god's provided way god give them that way to lead them but the same god that gave a duck the ability to do that is the same god that gave men the holy ghost makes a way of escape and if they reject it and wants his own way god always sends mercy than judgment god always has made a provided way sometimes it don't lead through pleasant things sometimes it goes through hardships but it's god's provided way god makes it anyhow hardships the three hebrew children very special story to me god made a way but it was through a fire how hard was that that wasn't just your easy choice of do you want rice krispies or cheerios in the morning or do you want an egg omelet no so you want to bow or you want to burn it wasn't the choice between a ford and a chevrolet or what house you would live in or or what day you'll leave a certain place no it was you're going to bow or you're going to burn that's a hard choice to make and they begin to listen to the threats and things and they say well you know you can do whatever you want to o king you can you can heat it up as hot as you want it you can play your music as loud as you want it you can do what he would want to you can make all your threats but as for us we're not bowing to your idol why would they not bow to the idol because it was in the word they knew it was god's will for them not to bow he said you shall have no other god before me no don't bow to a craving image he had all kinds of things in his word and they knew that was in his word and so they come to this moment and you know i said god give us some more shadrach meshach and abednego's amen that won't bow the world he is and won't bow to dress thing of the world won't bow to the hairstyles of the world won't bow to the nonsense of the world but are willing to go through the fire you know people wants the eternity they want the blessings they want the life and they want that but they don't want to pay the price brother branham would say it like this he said we don't have to knuckle down to the world god has made us free by the holy spirit well we can say that king said well you know in the morning we're going to heat it up everybody that don't bow they're going to be thrown in the fiery furnace they went and prayed next day the sound come to battle before the image and they turn their back to it that's my kind of boys king says boys did you really do that yep we did that so we're going to heat it up seven times hotter than ever was and here they had a gang plank you know going out into the fire and they began to bind their hands and take them down to this place and they look more and more and more and more and more hopeless it got hotter it didn't get easier we want it easy that's our way we like the easy ways we like the easy you know path that it's all puffy phillip pillows and and marshmallows and stuff so if we happen to fall we don't skin our knees i don't know why we're going all the way we're just going we like that especially laodicea the softest age there ever been we're the some of the softest people there's ever been and we love it soft gas prices are going up what am i going to do bicycle i don't know what we're going to have to do all i know is he's going to make a way food prices are going up what am i going to do i don't know what we're going to have to do all i know is he's going to make a way you don't think he can create food sure he can he's done it before and he'll do it again you say when he do that well i tell you when he done it was when a man challenged the governments of his day and said you know what you have sinned you've done wrong ahab and and jezebel you've done wrong you've made a mockery out of god it'll not rain for three and a half years and he turns around and walks out and it seemed like wow that was an amazing service but then he starts going through the try he's in the same place he ain't sitting somewhere else and enjoying the plushness and green grass no it's drying up around him too but god takes him to a place that has a little brook flowing and he sends some ravens down with some little sandwiches hello somebody he knew where elijah was he knew where to send him and he knew how to equip somebody to get some food to him and when all that dried up he said get up and go down to a little place i got a little widow woman that's going to take care of you god knows how to lead his children he knows where to lead you to the next meal he knows where to lead you to the next dollar whatever you have need of the light will lead you and it goes down there to that place and here she is this little woman's out there getting her last couple of sticks together gonna scrape the last bit out of her barrel and pour the last little bit out of her old jug and make her one last little cake and eat it and die she was in the same place it wasn't an easy place but the light all of a sudden began to shine upon her house man i want to be that kind of place that the light began to shine upon a house amen here the prophet of god comes down and says hey will you make me a cake you make me a cake and you make me you you give me a drink well what do you mean make you want i got a child in here and i got myself to fend for we got one last little bit to give and this is all we got and we're gonna eat it and we're gonna die but something began to stir on the inside of her something began to take place and brother adam said it like this he said she got her two sticks and she put them together and she lit the fire in the middle he said that represented the cross and she took that meal and that oh oh my and she put it all together and she put it on that fire and she baked her one last cake and she got her one last drink and she came and gave it to the prophet of god that was an ultimate sacrifice because now she had nothing but the light had other ideas and the prophet of god said because you have done this because you have done this your oil will not go dry nor your barrel it will not go to it will not be empty until the day it rains and she would go every day to make herself another cake and it didn't have nothing in there the day before and she would look in and there's some more down there dig it up and put it and make another cake next time she was hungry she'd go back knowing she had scraped up the last bit was there and she'd reach down and just get her another pile full and bring it over what was it no matter what day she was in it was showing he's the same yesterday today and forever he's got enough he's more than enough and i tell you church of the living god when you don't see him working he'll still be working she didn't know it but over in that mill barrel while she was asleep while she was at rest the angels of god was granted some more meal while she was over there the angels of god were scoping out some more olive oil it was pouring back in her vessel listen i tell you what you ought to do it's not worried about which way the world's going you need to rest in your promises rest in them every day and while you're resting the angels are working while you're resting he's moving on the shed while you're resting he's still showing he's jehovah jaira this light will make a way it came down to the last step i'm sure that was singing it's over it's been a wonderful life but it was so good to live for him and they step off throw it into the fire meanwhile what they didn't know was was a conversation was going on in heaven angels were watching the angels in camp about those that fear him they're on guard they know when cancer strikes your body you don't have to tell him he already knows the angels have already sent back the word they know when they say listen they can see demon spirits they can see those things at work they know what is going on and so they're there and they're on guard and we know brother brown bring it out and talk about michael would come and say with a sword drawing said you see what's going on down there in babylon this morning have you seen your children they're not bending they're not bowing they're not they're not willing to bow to an image it's in your word you're going to honor your word surely he said send me down there i'll destroy them all he did it before one angel went into a syrian army and killed what was a hundred and something thousand he'd done it before he knew he could do it again he's like just send me down it's over with warren would come up and said no hey i'll go down there i'll take a i'll take him and i'll i'll flood it all out i'll put the fire out with the great flood he did it before i love how he said it he said he said angels you've been really good at your jobs but today this ain't a job for you this is a job for me and it takes off those priestly robes lays them down those royal robes that lays them down upon his throne he steps down brother branham said he grabbed the east wind and the west wind and a zigzag of lightning and into the fire he went and while they're falling into that place all of a sudden they find themselves on their feet in the middle of a fire in the middle of what is very terrifying this wasn't your normal little backyard pit fire no this was enough that could consume the men that was even bringing them to the fire they couldn't stand the heat amen they couldn't stand it and it threw them off did you see what happened god again was leading his enemies to a trap they thought they was going to throw them to their destruction and it was their own destruction and here they come and they find amen the one that looked like the son of god was walking in the fire with him and they're in the fire fellowshipping with him they're in the fire talking about him they're in the fire talking with him and they realize their bands have been burnt off and they come out of there without even the smell of smoke on them you're talking about a waymaker that'll take you through a fire that's burning amen and you listen you can you can put a little fire in here and burn it for five minutes how much smoke would be all over everything and they come out of there without even a smell of it and it was all gone that's a waymaker he knows how to make a way he knows how to bring you through a fire he knows how to bring you through a lion's den he knows how to bring you to a valley with a goliath in it he knows how to bring you through every situation he has not lost one [Music] he has not lost one and bride he's not going to lose you amen you may feel helpless you may feel hopeless but the angels are still on the job they're still grinding they're still stopping they're still putting the fires out they're still closing the mouth of lies hallelujah they're still pushing back cancer they're still at war with cancer they're still at war with every kind of disease satan have they're still in war with suicide spirits he's a waymaker through every situation he knows even in death he's a waymaker so i told this up there it may have said it here already i don't know but i want to say it again i told this at cloverdale the other day when i was telling that same story brother ron's you remember the story my ipad started playing i started brother brown started talking about a hymn it was down from his glory every living story i didn't pick it all didn't put all the pieces together right away but i knew i had been preaching on the god that answers and i knew he had answered when i realized what it was i thought well you know what my mom she's coming out with the smell of smoke it's over brother ron he's completely healed it's over this was my faith this is where i was at and i won't come home and i watched her go back in the hospitals i'm landing she goes back in the hospital she never comes out and i watched her go from one battle to another down down down until she left this world you don't think the whisper come to me like you made all that up you made every bit of that up you know you did i knew that wasn't right because i knew i didn't do that one day i was thinking about it and it was just rolling through my mind how it all took place and i'm thinking about it like lord why did all that happen and then her die the lord spoke to me and he says i didn't do that for her i did that for you he said because i wanted you to know when you you was about to step in a fire but i was going to be with you take that devil i've been through a fire our family's been through a fire this church has been through a fire we lost somebody we really loved but every step of the way he's been with us every moment even in our tears and our moments of agony and moments of of wondering how all this is going to be he's been with us he's never left us he's always sent a comforting word he's always done something right on time showing time after time after time you've been in the fire but i've been with you do you know how much confidence that gives you to know you're not alone in the middle of your trial to know you know you're in a fire and things are going all around you and it seems to be crumbling on every side woods popping sparks are flying heat's rising but he's still with me hallelujah and i want to tell you this church tonight he's not just with me he's with you also he's with you in your moments of despair he's with you in your moments when you don't know which way to turn don't worry there'll be a light to guide you to the next step to the next place to the next way whichever turn you need to take he'll be there for you he's been there forever saint throughout the ages and why would you think you would be an exception you're not an exception there's a provided way for men and women that's through jesus christ who died at calvary though his blood through his blood we have remission of sins and can receive the baptism of the holy ghost the approval of god that he's accepted us into his son christ jesus safely and secure god has a way and it's the only way it ain't the methodist way the baptist way the presbyterian way the pentecostal way and even the message way it's christ's way but i want to say this very clearly though the message in its in his purest form is christ just as he was through all the other ages just as he was with wesley and luther and everything else but when men start to build their dams and they start to stop they start stopping fires they start control burning only burn where they want it to burn and move where they want it to move and how they want it to move that ain't christ that's right but he is god's way he's god's provided sacrifice he's jehovah raphae he's jehovah jireh he's an over manassas when abraham offered up isaac he called that place jehovah jiber the lord will provide himself a sacrifice god made a way of escape he did it he'll do it through every time we can see him as he come down down to the moments of of history 2 000 years ago it seemed like a nation was tumbling the world was tumbling into despair and all of a sudden a light came on the street and there was a little virgin walking down the street and she's been pondering in her heart to things that had been taught of a prophecy that had been taken had been given behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and as she's thinking on these things a light begins to show itself and out of the light a man about six foot tall an olives complexion with his arms folded says mary the hand's maiden of the lord highly favored talking about me what have i done to be so favored we ain't done anything but he said we were that's all that matters you wonder why why did i get so highly favored that i could hear the truth of this hour and to believe it i'll just hear it but to believe it and the life of god to come down how did i get so highly favored was that because i was in a certain family or a certain place or certain no you're highly favored because he said you are you're chosen because he said you are you're his because he said you are and here she is walking down the road he begins to speak these things and something began to well upon her she couldn't understand it she couldn't put it all together she didn't have it all figured out but she just said be it unto me according to what you've said i will accept it i will believe what you said god wants a people that'll believe just what he said if it's in his word believe it if it's for healing believe it if it's for deliverance believe it if whatever it's in his word you hold on to it it doesn't matter how dark it gets hold on to it yes he's a wavemaker we can find him there in the bible as he would come begin into his ministry and we know the story of his friend lazarus and he goes on like he's moving away from them and she's getting sicker until he dies and now he's four dead days dead and it seems like an impossible situation seems like there's no hope anymore and he turns back towards them and begins to walk for them and and martha hears that he's coming and she begins to run toward jesus he said why did she run towards him because she knew he was god's provided way he said that's always what you got to do when you've got sorrow in your home go meet jesus when you got sickness in your home go meet jesus you got heartaches in your home go meet jesus if you got a need of anything go get go meet him he's got the remedy for everything he's got the cure for everything and she ran to meet him and fell down at his feet why because she had read a story of a shunamai woman that had lost her son and there was no hope it was a promise given to her and she lost it and there seemed to be no hope and what did she do she didn't wallow in her misery she saddled her donkey and she got on her way to go see the prophet and she goes up and she finds him as he's walking towards her and she goes towards him and he says is it well with t and she said all is well all is well and she tells him what's taking place as he goes back to her place and raises the promised son back up again why because she believed the words that he had spoken and this martha had read those words she had read it and she knew if he did it then he can do it now he knew she knew that he had the power of the resurrection she knew that he was god's provided way for the moment when it seemed impossible and it seemed like there was no hope and it seemed like his nose is sunk there and it's dirty and smelly in there and he's just gone if you'd have been here he would not have died but even now lord what you s what you ask it shall be done even now lord why because she knew he was god's provided way she knew he was the waymaker when there even seemed to be no way he said i can see him i don't know how brother tim has brought this out it just clarified it for me as he stood there and he wept knowing that he was about to bring him from a beautiful place back to this so filthy life again he knew where lazarus was but he knew he had to do it to prove who he was but he weeps about it knowing that lazarus is going to have to go through a lot more things again and even death again and losses again and failures again and problems again situations again and he's over in a perfect place it's what gave me such comfort even with my mom because i knew her body was wasn't there to hold her no more and she left this place in a broken body and i got to reading about brother branham going past the curtain of time and here he's got his head hands behind his head he says he's thinking about the other side and he's starts hearing this song what was that song i thought he started hearing a song i'm homesick and blue want to see jesus he said well would you like to go over there and he said yeah yeah would you like to take a look yeah and he museum feels himself moving out of this body and all of a sudden he's running his fingers through that bluegrass and he's walking down and all of a sudden he sees thousands upon thousands of running towards him screaming oh my precious brother we know the conversation and all that took place and he said all of a sudden he felt his body going back he felt himself going back and he turned and he says do i have to go back to that here he is laying beside a woman he loves children in the other room and a body is about 50 years old pretty pretty still pretty healthy and active do i have to go there do i have to go back they don't want to come back here to pick up these old bodies again they only want to come here for the resurrection and god is making a way of escape and the trap in this hour that we're living in it seems to be closing and closing and closing how we going to get out here how is all this going to work out how is it going to be what's going to take place i don't know but i do know that one day before that trap closes i'm going to be snatched out of here and i'm not going to be the only one i know god's got a body all over this world it's going to change and god's going to make a way of escape what a way think about that i mean it's wonderful to read about the red sea and what he did there and the goliath and what he did there all down to the books of the bible and even what he did when he walked here on the shores of galilee and the woman with the blood issue the way of escape gyrus in the way of escape i mean how many we could go through time after time after time but we're about to come to our turn what a way of escape this is going to be your body might be riddled with cancer it might be riddled with sugar diabetes or blood high blood pressure but all of a sudden it's gonna escape and it's going to be moved and this body is going to be changed to be like his glory what a way of escape is that brother timothy i get so worried about what eternity's like what what what is it like i can't get to the end of it my mind gets blowed no we can't comprehend it it's impossible all i know is i want to be there because i know if i had my choice i'd want to live as long as i could live in this old evil world that i'm living in as far as humanly speaking as far as all i know right now i've never experienced that other side but once i ever do i'll never want to come back here once i ever get on the other side and i'm sitting around that table a thousand miles long or however it's designed and i'm visiting i'm fellowshipping and plagues are being poured out upon this earth i ain't never gonna one come back here until it's my time to come back here and i'll step out on the ashes of the wicked and i'll be we begin to create a new lands and new places and begin to build and not another inhabit and planting another eat from there that's going to be a wonderful time and what a way of escape what a way to go amen you know they think about people that just dies in their sleep and you hear that what a way to go listen what a way to go one day you're here and the next day you're gone one day your body's full of cancer and the next day it's a new body it's never sin it's never had to add a sin or a thing or unbelief or a dirty thought it's all gold what a way to go are you ready to go god is making a way of escape he will not put more on this bride than she can stand but he'll snatch her out of here and i'll say oh god snatch us out of here i'm ready to leave this whole world i'm sick of it i'm sick of the politics i'm sick of the atmospheres i'm sick of it all it's time to go are you ready do you have your ticket [Music] let's buy our hands there is a way of escape but you got to accept it there's a way out of here i mean it ought to be all obvious to everyone yeah we was up there with a guide on lake doing some fishing he's not even really a christian man you could tell he had some evolution ideas and things but even out of his own mouth he says this world is coming to an end it can't go on like it is i thought god if this man could see this how much more should we be able to see it we tried to talk with him the level we could get him to but there is a way of escape but you got to accept it so lord i i just want to leave this whole world leave it all behind whatever young people don't let eternity scare you when you get over there we'll understand it all by and by what you need to do is let this world scare you because it's a scary place right now the situations that are happening taking place as far as humanly speaking people are shaking in their boots losing their minds to where they'd go shoot up innocent lives demonic things are taking place this world is not our home we're only just passing by take the way of escape don't be like the man who was on top of his roof house and the waters were rising screaming oh god help me oh god help me boat comes by he said oh no no no god's gonna help me oh god help me oh god help me a little bit later a helicopter comes over his house and throws down a rope he said oh no no god's gonna help me and he ends up dying and he asked god why didn't you help me he said what do you mean i got you to church on a wednesday night i got you there on sundays the atmosphere was there i'd done everything i could i sent help by your way and you thought oh that's just brother joe that's his brother timothy that's his brother tim don't reject the way of escape let him make the way for you wanted me to say lord i want to accept my way of escape tonight i want to get out of here yes lord rise above this whole world lord jesus we're
