[52:44] omnipresent he's there for you and
[52:47] whatever need that you have
[52:49] as the holy spirit sweeps across the

[52:56] let him reveal himself through the word
[52:59] let him reveal
[53:01] i want to heal you more than what you
[53:03] even
[53:04] think
[53:05] i want to show myself real to you more
[53:07] than what you even think
[53:09] i want to give you the holy ghost
[53:11] more than what you can even desire it
[53:14] i want to give you
[53:16] every divine blessing
[53:18] it is yours
[53:19] you just reach out and receive it today
[53:23] amen the word preach has to be mixed
[53:25] with faith in them that hear it so mix
[53:28] it with faith today
[53:30] as we talk to the lord now
[53:32] if you've got a knee raise your hand to
[53:34] him
[53:34] father
[53:36] with their heads bowed they raise their
[53:38] hands because they're not raising it to
[53:40] me
[53:42] they raised it to the almighty god who
[53:44] is more than able
[53:46] who is more than a conqueror
[53:49] who conquered death hell and the grave
[53:53] oh god who defeated every sickness when
[53:56] he rose up on that third day
[53:58] [Music]
[53:59] who took with him to hell every trouble
[54:02] every problem that we could ever have as
[54:05] our sins was laid upon him
[54:07] and he is a scapegoat
[54:09] descended down into the regions
[54:12] of the lost
[54:14] and of the damned
[54:15] and he overcame death hell in the grave
[54:19] rose again triumphant
[54:21] and we're not preaching just a crucified
[54:24] christ today
[54:25] but a risen christ
[54:28] and we are here to show for the power of
[54:30] his resurrection in this hour and this
[54:32] time to this people
[54:34] and more than that
[54:36] lord more than just a resurrection and
[54:39] then ascension and you went away
[54:42] but you came back again on the day of
[54:44] pentecost
[54:45] to come and dwell your people
[54:47] to empower them
[54:49] that they could overcome in mortal
[54:51] bodies
[54:53] yes lord we live in this flesh
[54:56] but greater is he that is in us than he
[54:58] that's in the world
[55:00] so therefore we overcome the world the
[55:02] flesh and the devil
[55:05] oh god we'll even overcome death itself
[55:08] because
[55:09] like you we're more than conquerors
[55:12] i pray now father that you'll bless your
[55:14] people heal them
[55:16] even as the word goes forth may that
[55:18] quickening power just reached down into
[55:21] their heart
[55:22] and that faith reach up and take a hold
[55:25] of the promise
[55:26] for their healing and for their
[55:28] deliverance
[55:29] in the name of jesus christ we ask him
[55:33] amen
[55:34] and amen god bless you
[55:36] turn with me to luke chapter 18 and
[55:39] we'll read from verse one
[55:41] amen we appreciate
[55:43] the musicians and songs that were sung
[55:46] amen comes from dedicated hearts
[55:50] and consecrated lives
[55:53] we appreciate that
[55:55] luke chapter 18 verse 1 and he spake a
[55:58] parable unto them to this end
[56:00] that men ought to always pray and not to
[56:04] faint
[56:06] satan there was in a city a judge which
[56:09] feared not god nor
[56:11] neither regarded man
[56:14] and there was a widow in that city and
[56:16] she came unto him saying avenge me of
[56:18] mine adversary
[56:21] and he would not for a while but
[56:23] afterwards he said within himself
[56:26] though i fear not god nor regard man
[56:29] yet because this widow troubleth me i
[56:32] will avenge her
[56:34] lest by her continual coming she weary
[56:37] me
[56:39] and the lord said hear what this this
[56:42] unjust judge saith
[56:45] and shall not god avenge his own elect
[56:48] which cried day and night unto him
[56:50] though he bear along with them
[56:53] and i tell you
[56:55] that he will avenge them speedily
[56:57] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[57:01] shall he find faith on the earth
[57:03] god bless you can be seated
[57:06] i'm going to be speaking this morning on
[57:08] that little faith woman
[57:12] and in a little while i'll read a quote
[57:14] from god of this evil age from which i
[57:17] will
[57:18] will take my title from today
[57:21] but the bible lets us know that its
[57:24] promises are only to those that
[57:27] diligently seek him
[57:30] and the jesus would tell us that from
[57:33] the days of john the baptist until now
[57:35] the kingdom of heaven suffered violence
[57:38] and the violent take it by force
[57:42] and other translations will say it this
[57:44] way and from the days of the john the
[57:46] baptist until the present time the
[57:48] kingdom of heaven
[57:49] has endured violent assault and
[57:52] violent men cease it by force
[57:56] as a precious prize a share in the
[57:58] heavenly kingdom is sought with most
[58:01] ardent zeal and intense exertion
[58:05] and then again another translation says
[58:08] it this way from the moment john stepped
[58:10] onto the scene until now the realm of
[58:13] kingdoms heaven's kingdom is bursting
[58:15] forth and passionate people have taken
[58:18] hold of his power
[58:20] amen so if you look in this you can you
[58:24] can see even from the words of jesus
[58:27] of of how that a woman was
[58:31] coming to the judge with a persistent
[58:34] faith in believing and knowing that the
[58:38] judge was going to answer his her
[58:41] request
[58:43] and again
[58:44] you know as we read the the realm of
[58:47] heaven's kingdom is bursting forth and i
[58:50] thought about it as i read that of how
[58:53] that is burst forth in this age
[58:56] like in 1906 it came with an outpouring
[58:59] of the holy ghost
[59:00] on azusa street and a passionate people
[59:03] took hold of its power
[59:06] as i passed through the countryside the
[59:08] other day i went into rural areas right
[59:11] up on the edge of arkansas and
[59:13] well it actually was at three creeks
[59:16] just um on just across the border and i
[59:19] thought of other other times that i've
[59:21] read some of the historical
[59:24] uh events of this area
[59:27] and how that the holy ghost had moved
[59:30] and and um people had had responded to
[59:34] the call of god and there was little
[59:36] churches that raised up are these
[59:39] fanatics called pentecostals
[59:42] and and so now as i as i was coming to a
[59:45] tree of three creeks i looked there and
[59:46] i saw
[59:47] um an assembly of god church no doubt a
[59:50] remnant of what was left over from that
[59:52] revival and and then and of course as
[59:55] you come down to cotton valley there's
[59:57] two of them and that little small
[59:59] hamlet of a town
[1:00:01] but nevertheless it just shows you that
[1:00:04] that um even from that revival there
[1:00:07] were passionate people at that time
[1:00:10] that took a hold of his power
[1:00:13] and over and over again it has burst
[1:00:16] forth into this last age
[1:00:18] where it's happened again in in 1909
[1:00:21] when the pillar of fire hung over a
[1:00:23] little baby crib and in a cabin in rural
[1:00:26] kentucky and then a greater portion
[1:00:29] would happen again in 1933 on the ohio
[1:00:32] river and would scream out as john the
[1:00:35] baptist for run the first coming of
[1:00:37] christ
[1:00:38] you're sent with a message to forerun
[1:00:40] the second coming of christ
[1:00:43] then in 1946 it materialized in the form
[1:00:47] of an angel and from there it burst
[1:00:49] forth into healing and then discernment
[1:00:52] and then again
[1:00:54] of the seven angels would burst forth
[1:00:56] from other dimensions
[1:00:58] and bring the revelation of the seven
[1:01:01] thunders that are contained in the seven
[1:01:03] seals
[1:01:04] and even brother branham would make note
[1:01:06] of this and seed not air with the shock
[1:01:08] he said at the opening of the seven
[1:01:10] seals revelation 10 the full word is
[1:01:13] born in the manifestation again i want
[1:01:16] you to pay attention to that because
[1:01:18] again he speaks that the full word is is
[1:01:22] to be born into
[1:01:24] manifestation again
[1:01:27] and vindicated by the spirit of god in
[1:01:29] full strength
[1:01:31] as it was when he was here on the earth
[1:01:33] manifested in the same way
[1:01:36] doing the same things as that it did
[1:01:38] when he was here on earth again hebrews
[1:01:41] 13 8 jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:01:45] today and forever
[1:01:48] so it is
[1:01:49] bursting forth from the from the
[1:01:51] forerunner even until now
[1:01:54] and i'm going to just tell you
[1:01:55] passionate people
[1:01:57] must lay hold on it
[1:01:59] and when violent men sees it by force as
[1:02:02] a precious prize a share in the heavenly
[1:02:06] kingdom is sought with most ardent zeal
[1:02:10] and intense exertion
[1:02:12] again brother branham was told um
[1:02:16] very clearly by a prophecy given through
[1:02:18] danny henry where it was spoken french
[1:02:21] and another um interpreted and and uh it
[1:02:25] was interpreted that a huge portion of
[1:02:29] heaven awaits you
[1:02:31] and i just want to say to you today this
[1:02:33] is what awaits us all
[1:02:36] is a huge portion
[1:02:38] of the heavenly realm
[1:02:40] heaven consists of his word
[1:02:43] and the word not just the theology but
[1:02:45] the word in his power
[1:02:48] amen a huge portion of heaven awaits you
[1:02:52] and and there are violent men
[1:02:54] men and women with a passion with a
[1:02:57] drive on the inside of them that are
[1:03:00] pressing
[1:03:01] amen they're exerting everything that
[1:03:04] they have they're pressing them into the
[1:03:06] spirit realm they want more of god than
[1:03:10] they have ever had they're experiencing
[1:03:13] more of god
[1:03:14] that ever they are not satisfied with
[1:03:17] just church energy they're not satisfied
[1:03:20] with just sitting on a pew but they want
[1:03:23] to know god in his fullness
[1:03:25] and there's a rapture to be acquired and
[1:03:28] to be attained there's a body change
[1:03:31] there's the resurrection of the saints
[1:03:34] that lay right before us
[1:03:36] this is a great hour that we're living
[1:03:39] and remember when we're speaking about
[1:03:41] the kingdom of heaven we're not we're
[1:03:44] not talking about the sweet by and by
[1:03:47] amen we are speaking of the holy ghost
[1:03:50] that is the heavenly kingdom that's the
[1:03:53] heaven that we acquire now
[1:03:56] that portion of heaven is in the holy
[1:03:59] ghost
[1:04:00] a huge portion then of the holy ghost is
[1:04:03] ours
[1:04:05] to be the bride we share with christ in
[1:04:07] this supernatural kingdom
[1:04:10] and it requires that violent men and
[1:04:13] women lay hold on what is theirs and
[1:04:15] that take hold of the heavenly realm for
[1:04:18] the full word has now come and been born
[1:04:22] into manifestation
[1:04:25] now jesus likened us to a persistent
[1:04:27] woman who will never give up
[1:04:31] if you notice this parable is given and
[1:04:33] that jesus is liking in the kingdom of
[1:04:36] heaven
[1:04:37] he is likening us to a persistent woman
[1:04:42] to a woman who will never give up
[1:04:46] this is hers this is her inheritance
[1:04:50] amen and so she has no earthly husband
[1:04:53] to attain it for her but she's not given
[1:04:56] up on it
[1:04:57] she's pressing through
[1:04:59] she's going to attain it
[1:05:02] and he realizes you know with this woman
[1:05:04] she will not give up she will not quit
[1:05:07] until
[1:05:08] i'm offense of mine enemy
[1:05:10] i tell you that ought to be you today
[1:05:13] when you look at your enemy i will not
[1:05:15] give up until my enemy is defeated
[1:05:19] until i have complete victory on him and
[1:05:21] i get back what he stole from me
[1:05:24] amen i will not sit down i will not be
[1:05:27] blessed i will not be complacent
[1:05:30] remember i will press in with everything
[1:05:33] that i got until i trained everything
[1:05:36] the word of god described for me to have
[1:05:41] the bride must be a persistent woman
[1:05:46] who lay holds on the promise
[1:05:48] now satan wants to try to make us now
[1:05:52] just all word
[1:05:54] and no spirit
[1:05:56] or all spirit and no truth
[1:05:59] that's right
[1:06:00] because he wants to change us from true
[1:06:02] worship
[1:06:04] now there was a time
[1:06:07] that the church in the azusa state
[1:06:10] was in danger of taking the anointing
[1:06:14] and its emotion and rejecting truth
[1:06:18] let me say that again there was a time
[1:06:21] that the church in the azusa stage was
[1:06:24] in danger of taking the anointing and
[1:06:27] its emotion and rejecting truth
[1:06:31] you find this laodicea he will be
[1:06:33] rejected
[1:06:35] is that right standing on the outside
[1:06:37] the church knocking trying to get in
[1:06:40] so you hear
[1:06:42] the prophet warning against taking the
[1:06:44] emotion and the anointing only and
[1:06:47] rejecting the word
[1:06:49] so during those times we learned how
[1:06:52] that the true genuine anointing could
[1:06:55] anoint false seed
[1:06:57] amen but the anointing was never the
[1:06:59] problem
[1:07:01] you hear what i'm saying it was the seed
[1:07:04] that was a terror
[1:07:05] the anointing is vital it is important
[1:07:09] for without it the seed can never
[1:07:11] germinate or come to life so it was
[1:07:14] never the anointing that was the problem
[1:07:17] the rain was sent for the wheat
[1:07:20] the problem was there were terror
[1:07:22] rejoicing in it too
[1:07:24] that's right amen
[1:07:26] now so again don't ever strike at the
[1:07:28] anointing
[1:07:30] strike at the vault seed
[1:07:32] who is responding to the anointing but
[1:07:35] yet yet our fault seed
[1:07:38] bringing forth a false doctrine
[1:07:41] the warning against taking the spirit
[1:07:44] only or the emotion is not valid in our
[1:07:47] case
[1:07:50] i i want that to go across the land
[1:07:53] i wanted to go right here in this church
[1:07:55] the warning against taking the spirit
[1:07:58] only or emotion only is not valid in our
[1:08:01] case
[1:08:02] we are not rejecters of the word
[1:08:05] amen
[1:08:07] amen we have embraced the world
[1:08:10] the whole world
[1:08:11] we have been we have not rejected the
[1:08:14] open book
[1:08:15] we believe
[1:08:17] we are artist believers fervent
[1:08:20] believers solid believers and we believe
[1:08:23] all the word
[1:08:25] amen so the warning against taking the
[1:08:27] spirit only our emotion only is not
[1:08:30] valid in our case
[1:08:32] it's not even talking to us whatsoever
[1:08:35] because we're not about to trade the
[1:08:38] word for some emotion
[1:08:41] amen but neither do we want the word
[1:08:43] without power
[1:08:46] amen because the true word will always
[1:08:48] have power
[1:08:51] so so again
[1:08:52] as i said we have not rejected now it is
[1:08:56] just as dangerous
[1:08:58] to reject the anointing as it is to
[1:09:01] reject the word
[1:09:04] true worship must be done in spirit and
[1:09:07] in truth
[1:09:09] you see those who true worshipers
[1:09:12] who who are the true worshipers worship
[1:09:15] in spirit and in truth not just one or
[1:09:17] the other or one without the other but
[1:09:20] both of them
[1:09:22] now the word without the spirit kills
[1:09:27] it brings death the letter kills but the
[1:09:29] spirit gives life is that right
[1:09:33] so yeah you can find where brother
[1:09:35] branham corrected both he corrected
[1:09:37] taking the word without the spirit
[1:09:40] and he condemned having preachers
[1:09:41] without anointing
[1:09:44] amen he condemned um he condemned
[1:09:47] salvation without an experience
[1:09:50] confessions without tears
[1:09:53] he called them dried-eyed confessions he
[1:09:55] condemned churches without miracles
[1:09:58] saying if god be with us then where are
[1:10:01] the miracles
[1:10:03] amen he told us over and over again that
[1:10:05] preaching was not teaching but
[1:10:08] demonstrating the word with his power
[1:10:11] he spoke against churches who were
[1:10:13] mourned saying jesus wasn't there
[1:10:16] because anywhere jesus is there's noise
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:22] yet at the same time he warned against
[1:10:24] bubble dancing
[1:10:26] with empty emotion while rejecting the
[1:10:28] word
[1:10:29] he condemned heaven miracles
[1:10:32] although
[1:10:33] all the while denying truth
[1:10:35] because he referred to jesus word saying
[1:10:38] many will come to me in that day saying
[1:10:39] we have done many mighty miracles in my
[1:10:42] name and yet they were workers of
[1:10:44] iniquity
[1:10:46] he condemned jumping and shouting while
[1:10:48] not living the life amen
[1:10:51] but he said it's all right to jump yes
[1:10:54] amen then but just jump as as high as
[1:10:57] you live
[1:10:59] well i say if you're living that high
[1:11:01] then that's all you can jump if you're
[1:11:02] living this high that's all you can jump
[1:11:04] if you're living this high that's all
[1:11:06] you can do if you're living this high
[1:11:08] you got a long ways to jump
[1:11:13] amen
[1:11:14] but i want to say it again we are not
[1:11:16] word rejecters
[1:11:18] you tell me one word we reject
[1:11:21] and neither will we reject the spirit
[1:11:24] and its anointing
[1:11:26] in fact our problem around the message
[1:11:28] today is not having the dynamics
[1:11:31] without the word
[1:11:33] amen it's because we went off the
[1:11:36] opposite direction
[1:11:37] of warning just theology of the message
[1:11:40] while rejecting the dynamic power of the
[1:11:42] holy ghost
[1:11:44] in fact brother random told us
[1:11:46] that too much stress was on the
[1:11:49] mechanics
[1:11:50] and not and nothing on the dynamics
[1:11:53] those are his words he said it needs the
[1:11:56] dynamic power of god the resurrection
[1:11:58] power of jesus christ upon the church to
[1:12:02] to manifest to bring to pass that this
[1:12:04] is gasoline
[1:12:06] so the church must be one that has both
[1:12:08] the dynamics and the mechanics
[1:12:12] now this is what he proved as he says
[1:12:15] and it is the rising of the sons what
[1:12:17] easter proof he wasn't only the word but
[1:12:20] he was god himself the dynamics in the
[1:12:23] word
[1:12:24] notice not just the word but god himself
[1:12:27] the dynamics in the word that made the
[1:12:30] body of jesus christ cold still dead in
[1:12:32] the grave to life again and roll
[1:12:35] away the stone i am he that was dead he
[1:12:38] was so dead till the sun said he was
[1:12:40] dead the moon said he was dead the stars
[1:12:43] said he was dead all nature said he was
[1:12:45] dead and now the whole world has to
[1:12:47] recognize he's alive again
[1:12:50] and he was not only the mechanics god's
[1:12:53] word but he was the dynamics to prove it
[1:12:57] and he being a part of being the groom
[1:12:59] and the bride has to come forth because
[1:13:02] it's a part of him i want you to listen
[1:13:05] and it can only be the manifestations
[1:13:08] wait wait
[1:13:09] manifestations
[1:13:11] say it with me manifestation
[1:13:14] of the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:13:17] that any other spoke of the bride
[1:13:20] it can only manifest if it does
[1:13:22] something different from the groom it
[1:13:24] isn't the bride
[1:13:26] because she's flesh of his
[1:13:29] bone of his bone life of his life power
[1:13:32] of his power she is him
[1:13:34] as a man and woman or one and the woman
[1:13:36] taken from his side she had taken a
[1:13:39] spirit the feminist spirit from him the
[1:13:41] flesh from his side they
[1:13:44] both mechanics and dynamics the wife the
[1:13:47] spirit of him and the flesh of him put
[1:13:49] together and made mechanics and dynamics
[1:13:54] now
[1:13:55] all he said and he said until the church
[1:13:58] of the people all these easter bunny
[1:14:00] ceremonies big churches and fineries in
[1:14:03] other words denominational
[1:14:05] theories and fiction it will all fail
[1:14:07] and pass away but until that church
[1:14:10] becomes both dynamics and mechanics
[1:14:14] and the spirit of god that moved him to
[1:14:16] do the things that he did if he hit on
[1:14:19] 16 cylinders
[1:14:21] so will the bride
[1:14:23] amen for he said john 14 12 he that
[1:14:26] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:14:28] shall he do also i'll give him charge a
[1:14:31] charge of my dynamics in his mechanics
[1:14:34] and the world will not be able to
[1:14:35] withstand it i'll raise him up at the
[1:14:38] last day
[1:14:39] that's the easter message the dynamics
[1:14:42] and the mechanics together
[1:14:44] the mechanics without dynamics no good
[1:14:48] neither is dynamics without the
[1:14:50] mechanics you can scream and shout and
[1:14:53] jump up and down all you want to and
[1:14:56] deny this word it won't do any good
[1:15:00] you're just cranking around on this
[1:15:01] pistons you've got spark there to fire
[1:15:04] but no gasoline to fire by it'll only
[1:15:07] come it'll only work as they come
[1:15:09] together amen
[1:15:10] so one will sit still and one will go up
[1:15:14] i don't know about you but i want to be
[1:15:16] the one that goes up
[1:15:18] amen then in order to do it the dynamics
[1:15:21] of this church will be what a refilling
[1:15:24] of the holy ghost
[1:15:28] that we only worked in small measure
[1:15:31] while while the the body was growing up
[1:15:34] but now we come to the full power of the
[1:15:36] holy ghost
[1:15:37] to full power to where it will raise the
[1:15:39] dead
[1:15:41] change our bodies
[1:15:42] and translate us from this dimension to
[1:15:45] another
[1:15:46] amen now so again
[1:15:48] he says it won't move no matter how good
[1:15:51] the mechanics is
[1:15:52] until the dynamics come when the
[1:15:54] dynamics come that's the fire is made to
[1:15:57] connect that octane and the gasoline and
[1:16:00] when that explodes this causes a
[1:16:02] combustion
[1:16:03] and that combustion moves every
[1:16:07] motion every move for he's the same
[1:16:09] yesterday today and forever
[1:16:11] that's the resurrection that's a real
[1:16:13] power of god mechanics with the dynamics
[1:16:17] notice it's the spirit that quickens
[1:16:20] it's the spark that fires it's not the
[1:16:23] gas that fires it's the spark that fires
[1:16:26] the gas
[1:16:27] you can do nothing without me but with
[1:16:29] me you can do all things and he is the
[1:16:32] word is the father living the father
[1:16:34] sent me so send i you as the father
[1:16:37] fired me and pushed me into everything i
[1:16:39] do only that which is pleasing to god as
[1:16:42] he sent me so send i you with the same
[1:16:44] mechanics and it takes the same dynamics
[1:16:47] to operate it and these signs shall
[1:16:50] follow them that claim to have the
[1:16:51] mechanics the dynamics will take place
[1:16:56] paul said the
[1:16:57] gospel came to us not in word only
[1:16:59] through gasoline only but through spark
[1:17:02] also to make it move there you are it
[1:17:05] came to us in that manner
[1:17:08] amen that's the way it's got to be here
[1:17:10] in this last day
[1:17:12] in the same manner the dynamics and the
[1:17:14] mechanics together
[1:17:16] amen remember not words and rejecters
[1:17:19] not anointing rejecters
[1:17:23] amen
[1:17:24] amen but both of them together
[1:17:28] hallelujah what it does it causes a
[1:17:30] combustion
[1:17:32] amen something bursts forth the power
[1:17:35] rises up out of that church
[1:17:39] amen now when he went to calvary
[1:17:41] remember he went with you in him god
[1:17:44] never had separated the bride from the
[1:17:46] groom yet
[1:17:47] so when god looked down upon the body of
[1:17:49] christ he saw both male and female
[1:17:52] it was all redeemed in that one body
[1:17:55] they are the one same word the same word
[1:18:00] spoke of the groom speaks of the bride
[1:18:04] amen how can the bride come and fail to
[1:18:06] manifest everything was promised of him
[1:18:08] and the grim come and he wouldn't be the
[1:18:11] bride but when he did everything even to
[1:18:13] proven it by raising himself up from the
[1:18:15] dead afterwards then don't the bride
[1:18:18] have to do the same thing
[1:18:20] have to be exactly what the word said
[1:18:22] she would be in the last day don't you
[1:18:25] have to return
[1:18:26] to malachi 4.
[1:18:28] what is it amen returning back to the
[1:18:31] faith of the pentecostal fathers amen
[1:18:33] don't you have to be manifested like she
[1:18:35] was in the days of sodom so shall it be
[1:18:38] with the son of man the word is revealed
[1:18:41] don't the world have to be exactly like
[1:18:43] it is isn't these things a perfect
[1:18:46] identification of the word of god made
[1:18:48] known to us yes
[1:18:50] amen
[1:18:52] now throughout the bible
[1:18:55] there are stories of women
[1:18:58] who would persist
[1:19:00] and i want you to remember they are
[1:19:02] prophecies
[1:19:05] but looking at the bible is historical
[1:19:08] or nice story
[1:19:10] or the story the genealogy of the jewish
[1:19:13] people
[1:19:14] it's your genealogy
[1:19:17] amen is prophesying of you
[1:19:20] of an end time people amen and so again
[1:19:24] i'm going to repeat the they they were
[1:19:26] prophecies let me repeat these quotes
[1:19:28] brother branham said and him being the
[1:19:30] groom
[1:19:31] the bride has to come forth because it's
[1:19:33] a part of him and it can only be this
[1:19:36] only thing could be is the manifestation
[1:19:39] of the fulfilling of all the other
[1:19:41] revelations
[1:19:43] others spoke of the bride
[1:19:45] so you see though sarah didn't know it
[1:19:47] she was talking about she was
[1:19:49] prophesying of an end time people no
[1:19:52] ruth didn't know it she was doing more
[1:19:55] than just fulfilling a few pages in the
[1:19:58] bible
[1:19:59] come on church it's more than just the
[1:20:01] history of the ancient church or ancient
[1:20:04] israel and the king line it's our line
[1:20:08] it's our word it's i promise it's our
[1:20:11] prophecy this is thus saith the lord
[1:20:13] concerning the people in the last days
[1:20:20] now
[1:20:21] as we're saying this the same word then
[1:20:23] that spoke of the groom
[1:20:25] also spoke of the bride
[1:20:28] so then how can you deny john 14 12
[1:20:30] being to the bride of christ
[1:20:34] amen the works that i do so you do also
[1:20:37] greater than these
[1:20:39] how can the bride come
[1:20:41] and fail to manifest everything promised
[1:20:45] of him
[1:20:47] and the groom come
[1:20:50] and he wouldn't she wouldn't be the
[1:20:51] bride
[1:20:52] but when he did everything even proven
[1:20:56] it by raising himself up from the day of
[1:20:58] afterwards that don't the bride have to
[1:21:01] do the same thing don't you have to
[1:21:04] raise up in resurrection
[1:21:09] you see the word
[1:21:11] cannot be without manifestation
[1:21:16] other words
[1:21:17] otherwise it's just a creed or a dogma
[1:21:20] or historical or a nice story
[1:21:24] it has to have manifestation to be word
[1:21:29] there has to be the gasoline there the
[1:21:32] word full octane power
[1:21:34] amen the word born into full
[1:21:37] in the full manifestation
[1:21:40] amen but it has to have manifestation
[1:21:43] in order for it to be word
[1:21:47] now
[1:21:48] jesus asked this question
[1:21:52] when
[1:21:53] i return to earth will i find faith
[1:21:58] there's got to be a great church
[1:22:01] full of faith
[1:22:04] and god did things in our age
[1:22:07] to stimulate faith to cause us to
[1:22:11] believe
[1:22:13] amen now so this this is exactly where
[1:22:16] we're at and not only that but our faith
[1:22:20] is dead without manifestation
[1:22:24] you see your faith must be known by its
[1:22:27] works
[1:22:30] amen this is why we're putting the
[1:22:31] emphasis not just on having faith but
[1:22:34] also the works that accomplish that
[1:22:36] faith faith bringing the word into
[1:22:38] manifestation
[1:22:40] see jesus never did say would i find
[1:22:42] righteousness or well i find people
[1:22:45] living good there's going to be
[1:22:47] thousands of millions of multitudes
[1:22:49] without number that have washed the
[1:22:51] robes in the blood of the lamb and made
[1:22:52] them white
[1:22:54] amen good people that that were over in
[1:22:56] the white throne judgment they're
[1:22:58] they're giving life they're led into
[1:22:59] living waters
[1:23:01] amen but jesus asked when i return will
[1:23:05] i find faith
[1:23:08] amen and brother branham said some
[1:23:11] somebody they say oh i got faith he said
[1:23:13] well faith without works is dead will i
[1:23:16] find somebody
[1:23:18] who will stand at my word and say every
[1:23:21] word is right
[1:23:22] [Music]
[1:23:24] amen
[1:23:25] oh yes every word is right i say amen to
[1:23:28] every word brother branham says when he
[1:23:31] was corrupting the emotion
[1:23:33] while they're rejecting the word
[1:23:35] i say amen
[1:23:38] and praise god to every time that he
[1:23:40] speaks about emotion
[1:23:43] amen and rejoicing in truth
[1:23:46] amen
[1:23:48] and accepting the word but you see
[1:23:50] but but but you see your faith without
[1:23:53] works is dead faith
[1:23:56] well i find someone who will stand and
[1:23:58] say every word is right
[1:24:00] don't just preach to me one side of this
[1:24:03] every word is right that will live by
[1:24:06] every word
[1:24:08] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:24:11] amen now
[1:24:13] he said uh i'm not scared whether this
[1:24:16] one says so or that says so or nothing i
[1:24:18] believe in god i'm accepted i'm standing
[1:24:21] right there on it that's the thing god's
[1:24:23] preparing a church to be saved just as
[1:24:25] he did in the days of noah and that ark
[1:24:27] and the body of christ today is that art
[1:24:31] amen so you see down to the ages we find
[1:24:36] in the bible
[1:24:38] the faith of god
[1:24:39] within these women
[1:24:42] that prevailed
[1:24:44] and so it is faith and and the anointing
[1:24:47] that satan wants to kill
[1:24:50] so notice this you know he he he of
[1:24:53] course comes and attacks the word but
[1:24:55] the way he attacks the word is by coming
[1:24:58] against his power
[1:25:00] amen because he knows that a powerless
[1:25:03] gospel will never defeat him
[1:25:08] so what satan will come along and do he
[1:25:11] after the word is revealed he'll take
[1:25:15] the knowledge of it
[1:25:17] to kill with it
[1:25:22] and he will exalt the knowledge
[1:25:25] over the supernatural revelation that
[1:25:28] brought it
[1:25:30] so in christ the mystery brother brandon
[1:25:32] said what is the denomination trying to
[1:25:34] do exalts itself like luther they so
[1:25:38] call themselves the church the bride
[1:25:41] which they are in revelation 17 spoke of
[1:25:43] the false bride
[1:25:46] above
[1:25:47] they exalt themselves above christ's
[1:25:49] little flock the bride lucifer thinks
[1:25:53] and exalts himself above the humble word
[1:25:56] of god's truth by the knowledge of the
[1:25:59] revelation
[1:26:02] and it's placed himself by seminary
[1:26:04] education and theology until they've got
[1:26:07] themselves up and if you don't belong to
[1:26:09] their group then you're an outwash
[1:26:12] so this is what the devil does he comes
[1:26:14] along and exalts
[1:26:16] he hears the word preached
[1:26:19] and he takes the revelation
[1:26:23] that is now knowledge and exalts that
[1:26:26] knowledge over the supernatural
[1:26:28] revelation
[1:26:31] amen
[1:26:33] so you see this is what he wants to do
[1:26:35] take knowledge any and exalted over
[1:26:38] revelation
[1:26:41] you see revelation brings knowledge
[1:26:44] what happened when the opening of the
[1:26:46] seven seals happened it brought us
[1:26:47] knowledge didn't it
[1:26:49] brought us knowledge of who the horse
[1:26:50] rider was
[1:26:52] it brought us knowledge of how they
[1:26:54] changed their colors and what that meant
[1:26:56] it brought us knowledge about the souls
[1:26:58] under the altar
[1:26:59] brought us knowledge about the multitude
[1:27:01] without number and 144 000. it broke the
[1:27:04] silence of the seventh seal
[1:27:07] right
[1:27:08] amen so you see revelation brings
[1:27:11] knowledge
[1:27:12] but revelation can only come by the
[1:27:16] spirit
[1:27:17] and it's anointing and when it comes
[1:27:19] it's wine and it's stimulating
[1:27:24] and there is a whole lot of difference
[1:27:26] of difference between receiving
[1:27:28] knowledge and revelation
[1:27:32] because when it is revelation it is a
[1:27:34] whine of stimulation
[1:27:36] and there's a warning that comes out
[1:27:38] from the spirit that's hurting not the
[1:27:40] oil and the wine
[1:27:46] you touch doubt
[1:27:48] you're cursed if you touch the oil in
[1:27:50] the wind if you touch the stimulation
[1:27:54] that is to accompany revelation
[1:27:57] amen that you're under a curse from
[1:28:00] almighty god
[1:28:01] do not touch the oil and the wine use
[1:28:04] the warning of the spirit to satan
[1:28:08] it's the warning of the spirit to every
[1:28:10] preacher
[1:28:13] don't you dare try to serve this up
[1:28:16] without the oil in the wine
[1:28:25] because without it it's death is a
[1:28:28] hybrid knowledge
[1:28:29] it's the passing on of knowledge
[1:28:33] that comes from intellectual men
[1:28:37] and teaching rather than the holy spirit
[1:28:45] now you see
[1:28:47] as i said
[1:28:49] revelation brings knowledge
[1:28:52] but once
[1:28:53] it's revealed
[1:28:55] satan can take the knowledge of the
[1:28:57] revelation
[1:28:58] and exalt it over the revelation itself
[1:29:02] so all of a sudden having the knowledge
[1:29:05] is greater than the revelation
[1:29:09] which is supernatural
[1:29:11] revelation doesn't come from
[1:29:13] from being schooled and learned
[1:29:17] or being taught revelation comes from
[1:29:19] the holy ghost quickening
[1:29:21] the word to your life are you with me
[1:29:24] now
[1:29:25] so once revealed satan can take the
[1:29:28] knowledge of the revelation and exalt it
[1:29:30] over the revelation itself then you have
[1:29:33] knowledge without revelation
[1:29:36] truth without life
[1:29:38] and word without power
[1:29:41] amen
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:48] word without
[1:29:50] manifestation that's right
[1:29:53] a letter that kills yes
[1:29:59] this is what people want to do today
[1:30:02] preachers are guilty of taking the word
[1:30:04] and trying to kill the anointing
[1:30:10] now
[1:30:11] the revelation came with power it came
[1:30:13] from seven mighty angels
[1:30:16] it was not a learned knowledge
[1:30:19] day by day in the presence of the pillar
[1:30:21] of fire the seals were taken off the
[1:30:23] book it was not a teaching it was a
[1:30:26] supernatural revelation
[1:30:29] and remember after the revelation came
[1:30:31] then satan took the knowledge and built
[1:30:34] denominational camps with it
[1:30:38] deity camp return ministry camp thunder
[1:30:41] camps perugia camp two soul camps and
[1:30:44] now the tape only camp
[1:30:48] amen just personality cults why because
[1:30:50] that's the way the devil does exalts a
[1:30:53] personality instead of the word
[1:30:55] instead of god
[1:30:57] personality calls by taking the
[1:30:59] knowledge of the revelation and exalting
[1:31:02] it over the word
[1:31:04] which is spirit
[1:31:06] jesus said the words i speak they are
[1:31:08] spirit
[1:31:09] and life
[1:31:11] so it produces a group of people with
[1:31:13] knowledge of it without the revelation
[1:31:16] of it
[1:31:17] and when it does it produces a dogma
[1:31:20] instead of the holy spirit and people
[1:31:22] receive an organizational spirit that
[1:31:25] then fights against the holy spirit
[1:31:28] and this produces hybrid children
[1:31:33] mongolizing the offspring
[1:31:38] now
[1:31:40] but in all of this
[1:31:42] there is a woman
[1:31:45] that has more than a knowledge of the
[1:31:47] truth
[1:31:48] amen that wants more than anything the
[1:31:51] life of the truth
[1:31:52] and she is not satisfied with empty
[1:31:55] promises
[1:31:59] amen she's not satisfied with empty
[1:32:01] promises unfulfilled promises
[1:32:05] this is the way this woman was she had a
[1:32:07] promise and she's coming to the judge
[1:32:10] i've got a promise i've got a right to
[1:32:12] be here
[1:32:14] but he wasn't going to give it to her
[1:32:16] until she was persistent
[1:32:19] and jesus is telling the same thing it's
[1:32:21] going to take a persistent woman to lay
[1:32:24] hold on these promises
[1:32:26] otherwise the promises will remain empty
[1:32:32] unfulfilled
[1:32:34] without manifestation
[1:32:36] it'll be a word without life
[1:32:39] a letter that kills
[1:32:41] that makes another dead church
[1:32:44] that's right
[1:32:47] now
[1:32:48] this is this is a quote from the second
[1:32:51] coming 1955
[1:32:53] and and i want you to i want you just to
[1:32:55] take this to heart right now
[1:32:57] the gospel
[1:32:59] is not going out and teaching the bible
[1:33:02] that isn't the gospel
[1:33:05] it is written in the scripture that the
[1:33:06] word didn't come
[1:33:08] through just the word only but through
[1:33:10] the power and demonstrations of the holy
[1:33:12] spirit the gospel that is the word but
[1:33:15] the letter killeth the spirit giveth
[1:33:18] life
[1:33:19] now seed laying here on the pulpit is
[1:33:22] just a seed until it dies and becomes
[1:33:24] germatized
[1:33:26] it'll never do anything so the seed the
[1:33:29] word here has to be made manifest in
[1:33:32] order to be the gospel watch now the
[1:33:34] seed the word has to be made manifest
[1:33:39] in order to be the gospel
[1:33:41] word without manifestation is not the
[1:33:44] gospel
[1:33:46] and remember the gospel must be preached
[1:33:48] in all the world
[1:33:50] so that him can come so therefore it
[1:33:52] must be manifested
[1:33:58] a word is the expression of a thought it
[1:34:00] has to be a thought for it can be a word
[1:34:02] so god in the beginning gave the thought
[1:34:04] of what it would be he spoke the word
[1:34:06] for it to be we we receive the word and
[1:34:08] it produces what god thought it was the
[1:34:11] word is the gospel in seed form
[1:34:15] so now we have a seed but no life in it
[1:34:18] well there's life but it's potential
[1:34:20] life that's right
[1:34:22] right
[1:34:23] and it can only come when the water and
[1:34:26] the atmosphere produces the light
[1:34:29] so again it's gasoline without fire
[1:34:34] somebody somebody found a wheat germ or
[1:34:37] wheat seed in one of the pyramids in
[1:34:40] egypt and i understood that they planted
[1:34:43] it and they got in the right atmosphere
[1:34:45] and it it made up it came up and
[1:34:47] produced
[1:34:50] but it laid there for thousands of years
[1:34:54] thousands of years
[1:34:57] lifeless without life without power
[1:35:00] with because it had no manifestation
[1:35:02] until it was it come in the atmosphere
[1:35:06] and the water came upon it which is the
[1:35:08] spirit to dramatize it and make it life
[1:35:12] now brother bradley said if you asked me
[1:35:15] in your country and they gave you and
[1:35:17] they have
[1:35:19] anchored trees or oak trees said would
[1:35:21] you give me an oak tree and i give you
[1:35:23] an acre
[1:35:24] you have an oak tree potentially but
[1:35:27] it's in the seed form
[1:35:29] you can't say you have absolutely got a
[1:35:31] tree until the seed has produced a tree
[1:35:35] well preaching the word is the anchor
[1:35:38] but making it live is the gospel
[1:35:41] right if he promised the holy spirit
[1:35:43] that's the word and receiving the holy
[1:35:46] spirit is making it live manifesting and
[1:35:49] if he promised these blessings by the
[1:35:51] word then accepting the word and
[1:35:53] producing what he said what it said is
[1:35:56] the gospel
[1:35:57] go into all the world and preach the
[1:35:59] gospel to every creature and the very
[1:36:01] next line is proof
[1:36:04] that teaching of the word
[1:36:06] won't wouldn't do it that just teaching
[1:36:08] the word would not do it said these
[1:36:10] signs shall follow them
[1:36:13] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:36:15] their out devils evil spirits speak with
[1:36:18] new towns take up serpents drink deadly
[1:36:20] things that would not harm them lay
[1:36:22] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:36:24] now that's the gospel
[1:36:26] and theology and teaching has
[1:36:28] substituted that place
[1:36:33] now if we're not careful this is where
[1:36:36] we come to in this end time
[1:36:39] another
[1:36:40] group of people
[1:36:42] who substitute
[1:36:45] for the word
[1:36:47] for the true gospel theology and
[1:36:50] teaching amen
[1:36:53] now
[1:36:54] but in all of this
[1:36:57] there is a woman
[1:37:01] can you hear me
[1:37:02] prophesied in the scripture
[1:37:05] amen that she is persistent
[1:37:08] to not have the word that are
[1:37:10] unfulfilled words
[1:37:14] to not have empty promises
[1:37:16] amen and she'll go before the judge
[1:37:19] hallelujah we know who the judge is the
[1:37:23] supreme judge the weak one she will go
[1:37:26] before him and say give me my mountain
[1:37:29] give me my promise give me my word give
[1:37:32] me my healing give me my deliverance
[1:37:35] give us the holy ghost give us young
[1:37:37] people that are filled with the spirit
[1:37:40] give us
[1:37:42] and we're not giving up
[1:37:44] we'll keep coming until we get it
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:37:59] and seek and keep on seeking until it's
[1:38:02] given to us
[1:38:04] amen
[1:38:06] not just satisfied
[1:38:08] we're just becoming another
[1:38:10] denominational
[1:38:16] there is a woman
[1:38:18] let me read about her and god of this he
[1:38:19] believes
[1:38:21] but
[1:38:22] in obedience this little faith woman
[1:38:27] that lives by
[1:38:28] faith the bride the person here there

[1:38:43] uganda or wherever you're at listening
[1:38:45] today
[1:38:46] amen or whether you're listening or not
[1:38:49] if you're part of the bride you're it
[1:38:51] amen you are there this person here
[1:38:53] their little faith woman that lives by
[1:38:57] faith
[1:38:58] amen believes the word of god obedient
[1:39:02] waiting in love for the promise of the
[1:39:05] age to be confirmed
[1:39:07] she's watching for it she's a part of
[1:39:09] that word and she's watching for her
[1:39:11] life to manifest that word
[1:39:15] hallelujah i believe there's a little
[1:39:16] faith woman in that spelling this
[1:39:18] morning
[1:39:19] she's just locked out
[1:39:21] amen this one here that one there back
[1:39:24] in the mezzanine or up there in the back
[1:39:26] they've been a little fake woman a man
[1:39:29] that is waiting in love for the promise
[1:39:31] of the age to be confirmed watching
[1:39:34] foreign she is part of that word and
[1:39:36] watching for her life to manifest that
[1:39:40] word
[1:39:42] she's not satisfied with just empty
[1:39:45] promises
[1:39:49] brethren can you see that i hope that
[1:39:51] didn't go over you
[1:39:52] and he tries it again saying it this way
[1:39:55] the body is waiting for which is the
[1:39:57] word
[1:39:58] waiting for the life which is the spirit
[1:40:01] to confirm or make it alive
[1:40:05] and he said
[1:40:06] that's what she's waiting for no other
[1:40:08] life will work in her
[1:40:10] she can't come to life any other way she
[1:40:12] feels out that that way and she knows
[1:40:15] it's going to happen
[1:40:16] and then it happens and then she wakes
[1:40:18] up and god said let there be and she
[1:40:21] come forth just like the first one come
[1:40:23] forth
[1:40:24] so you see there she is waiting in love
[1:40:28] looking expecting
[1:40:30] she hasn't given up
[1:40:33] amen listen i haven't given up on a
[1:40:35] rapture
[1:40:37] i've been preaching in 52 years now been
[1:40:40] expecting a lot longer than that
[1:40:42] but i haven't given up on it
[1:40:44] i haven't given up on being a part of it
[1:40:48] amen to build their lives and remain at
[1:40:50] the coming of the lord
[1:40:52] hallelujah
[1:40:53] amen i haven't given up on any divine
[1:40:56] promise
[1:40:58] i'm waiting in love to see it manifest
[1:41:01] but it isn't complacent waiting
[1:41:04] i'm before the judge saying
[1:41:07] even so come lord jesus
[1:41:10] amen you opened up the seventh seal and
[1:41:12] and the the mysteries have been revealed
[1:41:14] and the prayers of the saints released a
[1:41:17] man that said they even so come lord
[1:41:19] jesus and you're bringing about the end
[1:41:21] time and i see it happen
[1:41:24] hallelujah i see things happening
[1:41:27] amen even where we're at right now
[1:41:29] you're chafing against it you're worried
[1:41:31] about it all of the attacks of the enemy
[1:41:34] and the covid situation and the politics
[1:41:36] and the roughness of our country but
[1:41:38] it's all a part of the plan of god
[1:41:48] but now let me finish the quote
[1:41:50] because in this you'll see you're either
[1:41:52] that little faith woman
[1:41:54] or your children of disobedience
[1:41:58] children of rebellion
[1:42:02] because just as there is a woman
[1:42:04] that is persistent
[1:42:06] there is a woman persisting and
[1:42:09] rejecting
[1:42:14] rejecting his headship
[1:42:17] rejecting his authority
[1:42:20] rejecting his power
[1:42:23] she don't want him
[1:42:26] she don't want his children
[1:42:33] because the only kind the word can bring
[1:42:34] forth oh brother i knew you'd go there
[1:42:37] yes i did
[1:42:38] i just did the only kind of word can
[1:42:41] bring forth
[1:42:42] amen is those tom speaking acts 238
[1:42:45] blabbering screaming youngest
[1:42:48] hallelujah children that are born of the
[1:42:50] word
[1:42:51] not born of the church but in the part
[1:42:53] of the word their spirit
[1:42:56] [Applause]
[1:43:00] children of disobedience disobedience
[1:43:02] means rebellion
[1:43:04] brother brandon said i looked it up in
[1:43:05] the dictionary to be sure rebelling
[1:43:07] rebellion guess what the revealed word
[1:43:09] of god
[1:43:11] like cain revealed rebelled against
[1:43:13] abel's revealed revelation vindicated
[1:43:15] god that it was righteous and came
[1:43:18] rebelled against it and slew his brother
[1:43:20] if that spirit isn't there today
[1:43:23] to fight against the movement of the
[1:43:25] holy ghost
[1:43:26] the pharisees with their own
[1:43:28] denominational knowledge of what the
[1:43:31] word was selected hand-picked men
[1:43:33] rebelled against the vindicated word of
[1:43:36] god made manifest for that day jesus
[1:43:38] christ and killed him that's right
[1:43:40] that's what the children of disobedience
[1:43:43] is is a rebellion against the word of
[1:43:45] god
[1:43:46] now you see where there are old days of
[1:43:49] miracles this past
[1:43:51] jesus christ is not the same yet
[1:43:53] there's no such thing as the baptism of
[1:43:56] the holy ghost all that stuff is
[1:43:58] nonsense see rebellion
[1:44:00] they don't have to say two things just
[1:44:03] have one just just rebel on one
[1:44:06] that's all that's rebellion right there
[1:44:08] they can't say
[1:44:10] you have you don't have eyes you you
[1:44:11] don't have ears you got to take the
[1:44:13] whole body the whole word and the holy
[1:44:15] spirit says come out of her be not
[1:44:17] partakers of her denominational dogma as
[1:44:20] he laughs and scorns at the word of god
[1:44:23] in this day
[1:44:24] for god is not malt just remember she'll
[1:44:27] get it
[1:44:28] don't be worried she will get it the
[1:44:30] bible galatians 6 7-9 said god is not
[1:44:33] mocked whatever man sows that he will
[1:44:35] also reap
[1:44:37] they can't mock and make fun and say
[1:44:39] these things and get by with it like a
[1:44:41] bread on the water it'll return
[1:44:48] but there has to become a woman
[1:44:52] a little faith woman
[1:44:54] it has to be she's prophesied and not
[1:44:57] one word of god will ever fall to the
[1:44:59] ground
[1:45:00] just as sure as the manual came a virgin
[1:45:03] conceived even so the same promise
[1:45:06] applies to pride in this end time
[1:45:09] amen
[1:45:11] what's now there has been churches
[1:45:12] churches brides bride churches brides
[1:45:14] rights but there's got to come one
[1:45:18] hey man there's got to come a real bride
[1:45:21] there's got to be one that's not only
[1:45:22] got the mechanics but the dynamics of it
[1:45:25] makes that church live move in the power
[1:45:27] of his resurrection
[1:45:29] and until we come that place until we
[1:45:31] find that place what does it good do it
[1:45:34] good to polish the hubs
[1:45:36] what good does it do to give her a
[1:45:38] facelift or a lift or a a simonized job
[1:45:42] when there's no dynamics in it no matter
[1:45:44] how much the mechanics prove to be right
[1:45:47] there's got to be a dynamics to make it
[1:45:49] work
[1:45:52] and you don't have the message
[1:45:55] until you have the dynamics
[1:45:59] because without the dynamics the message
[1:46:01] is only a theology
[1:46:07] a lifeless
[1:46:10] word now
[1:46:15] in the evidence
[1:46:16] of the resurrection brother branham
[1:46:18] talks about the evening time
[1:46:21] i like this because
[1:46:22] we named our church after the evening
[1:46:25] light a tabernacle a dwelling place for
[1:46:28] the evening light
[1:46:30] so let me say this with humility
[1:46:33] let me say this with a broken voice
[1:46:36] but with a broken heart too it's evening
[1:46:38] time the bible says it'll be light in
[1:46:40] the evening time there will be a day
[1:46:43] that it won't be neither day or night
[1:46:45] or night or day
[1:46:47] the prophet said it'll just be hearing
[1:46:49] the word with no manifestation
[1:46:52] hearing the word
[1:46:54] with no manifestation just a gloomy
[1:46:57] foggy day
[1:46:59] but in the evening time the light will
[1:47:01] shine again
[1:47:03] it'll be light and this in this evening
[1:47:05] time that we're now living with christ
[1:47:07] through his ministers has preached the
[1:47:08] gospel for 2000 years but this is the
[1:47:11] evening light and the evening lights was
[1:47:14] the manifestation of the resurrection
[1:47:18] hallelujah
[1:47:19] so isn't it something that right here in
[1:47:21] the middle where the king is being
[1:47:24] rejected like he was 2 000 years ago
[1:47:26] there's a resurrection taking place
[1:47:29] a resurrection first out of dark
[1:47:31] denominationalism
[1:47:35] and then a physical resurrection
[1:47:38] of the dead in christ
[1:47:40] without manifestation people are just in
[1:47:43] a fog of theology
[1:47:46] because there's no life to what you're
[1:47:48] preaching
[1:47:49] it's not even the gospel they turn the
[1:47:51] message into a dead creed
[1:47:54] now i just want to say that is not our
[1:47:56] problem
[1:47:58] we have been hearing the word we we have
[1:48:01] been hearing the word with manifestation
[1:48:04] the manifestation today though
[1:48:07] about many it is it is the real problem
[1:48:11] there there is no manifestation with the
[1:48:13] word that's being preached
[1:48:16] the word is preached without
[1:48:17] manifestation the manifestation of
[1:48:20] cleansing from sin
[1:48:21] is missing
[1:48:24] although they receive a knowledge of the
[1:48:25] truth
[1:48:26] can quote the seals and tell you this
[1:48:28] and this greek word but they can't live
[1:48:30] right
[1:48:32] amen to continue living in sin
[1:48:35] blaming it on their flesh
[1:48:40] amen
[1:48:41] as if the flesh is greater than the holy
[1:48:43] ghost
[1:48:46] don't blame your flesh
[1:48:48] blame your lack of experience
[1:48:51] this is why men and women are still
[1:48:53] living in sin
[1:48:55] is because the flesh is not killed out
[1:48:58] amen and there they still have as they
[1:49:02] still have all these lust of the flesh
[1:49:04] that are being manifested
[1:49:06] because there is no spirit of god in
[1:49:08] them to control it
[1:49:12] so brother tim we always have this flesh
[1:49:14] you will
[1:49:15] you do
[1:49:17] it's always a problem it is
[1:49:21] it isn't converted that's true
[1:49:24] but you're converted
[1:49:30] amen
[1:49:31] and greater is he that's in you
[1:49:35] than he that's in the world
[1:49:38] come on church
[1:49:39] amen although they receive a knowledge
[1:49:41] of the truth the manifestation of gifts
[1:49:44] and miracles is non-existent
[1:49:48] healing is almost non-existence
[1:49:51] tongues are scorned
[1:49:53] interpretation prophecy despised
[1:49:57] discernment of spirits missing
[1:50:00] although the word has been taught it's
[1:50:02] only theology unless the spirit is there
[1:50:06] to give it life
[1:50:08] you see the word does not profit unless
[1:50:10] it's mixed with faith
[1:50:13] amen all all of god doing what he did in
[1:50:16] this day and hour sending a prophet
[1:50:19] giving us a message is all without
[1:50:21] profit
[1:50:23] unless somebody mixes it with faith
[1:50:26] amen
[1:50:27] it'll just be hearing the word with no
[1:50:30] manifestation
[1:50:31] that's the reason for the fog and the
[1:50:33] gloom because of this and that no one
[1:50:36] can see clearly but let the evening
[1:50:38] light shine it's the manifestation of
[1:50:40] the resurrection a living god amen
[1:50:43] so brother bradham said this and it is
[1:50:45] the rising of the sun because i live you
[1:50:47] shall live also and i live in you and
[1:50:49] the works that i do
[1:50:50] john 14 12 the works i do will identify
[1:50:54] myself in you what a message
[1:50:56] no wonder we've had a dark world of
[1:50:58] theology but in the evening time there
[1:51:00] shall come light again there will be a
[1:51:03] resurrection in the evening time it
[1:51:05] shall be light
[1:51:07] at the evening time
[1:51:09] what does that mean god will restore a
[1:51:12] church to faith again
[1:51:14] amen just like he did to sarah
[1:51:17] who never got it until she became
[1:51:20] persistent
[1:51:22] until she judged him faithful who had
[1:51:24] made the promise
[1:51:26] until the angel came with the visitation
[1:51:29] and turned her heart to believe it
[1:51:34] and that's what this message was to do
[1:51:37] turn your heart to believe it
[1:51:40] he had to get her believing before she
[1:51:41] could receive the seed
[1:51:46] until then she's always believing it was
[1:51:48] for somebody else
[1:51:50] that hagar will take it
[1:51:52] give it to a bonds woman
[1:51:54] do it out here in denominations
[1:51:56] somewhere
[1:51:58] you know they can but i can't
[1:52:02] but god will restore a church
[1:52:04] now one such
[1:52:06] woman in the bible was tamar
[1:52:09] yeah he ever
[1:52:11] read the bible some strange stories in
[1:52:13] the bible
[1:52:14] but they're more than strange stories
[1:52:16] and prophecies
[1:52:18] in those days a child was a woman's
[1:52:20] worth it was her life to not have
[1:52:22] children was considered a disgrace
[1:52:25] in the bible we read of the the women
[1:52:28] that would use desperate measure to
[1:52:30] catch the seed
[1:52:33] and remember this woman tamar is
[1:52:35] mentioned in the bible you know when the
[1:52:37] light of judah was about to be
[1:52:39] extinguished
[1:52:40] and the seed line for the king was about
[1:52:43] to be put out
[1:52:45] amen the light of judah was about to be
[1:52:49] put off
[1:52:50] put out completely
[1:52:52] and without that there would be no king
[1:52:55] and without that there would be no
[1:52:57] messiah
[1:52:59] hallelujah but there is a faith that
[1:53:02] rises up in a woman
[1:53:06] you may not think it's faith i i'm not
[1:53:08] nothing with faith but something was
[1:53:10] moving on the inside of her a drive a
[1:53:14] passion
[1:53:16] hallelujah amen and and
[1:53:20] that right at the moment when the light
[1:53:22] of judah was about to be put out hear
[1:53:24] this woman rises up
[1:53:28] hallelujah somebody's got to catch the
[1:53:30] seed

[2:18:01] to where it becomes greater to have it
