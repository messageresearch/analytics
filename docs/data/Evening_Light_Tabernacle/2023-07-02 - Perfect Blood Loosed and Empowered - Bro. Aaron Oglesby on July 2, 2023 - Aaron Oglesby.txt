requirements Worthy is the Lamb this morning he's talked to him father how wonderful it is Lord to step into your presence Lord even to listen as the song service would go in a way Lord that would Lord give us confidence to know that we found the mind of God for this service Lord I ask that you'll just take complete control speak to every heart Lord May every doubt and every fear and every unbelief be driven out Lord by the word today Lord Lord as we recognize Lord there is nothing that can stand before us Lord called and chosen Lord and dipped in the blood of Jesus Christ Lord every sin every every claim everything that was ever against us has been struck off and today we thank you for that Lord as we look into the word may you anoint it Lord may you Quicken at the hearts and lives Quicken at the hearts that would struggle Lord and wonder Lord about their own worthiness and may they recognize today they're not worthy we're not worthy but Lord You Are there was no fault found in you and because of that today we stand redeemed by the blood of the worthy lamb thank you for that Lord I pray you'll bless the service now Lord be with brother job Lord as he ministers this morning be with brother Tim and brother Timothy as they travel home Lord those that are out Lord just have your hand upon them Lord and bless his service now Lord and with your presence and your anointing we thank you in Jesus name we pray amen if you have your Bibles with you I'd like you to turn with me to the book of Hebrews the 10th chapter and we're going to read verses 1 through 18. it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers their unto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscious of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he say his sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure then said I lo I come and the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hath thou pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever set down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their heart and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin amen I pray the Lord bless his word as you have your seats today wonderful words of life that we've read here recognizing that the sin question was dealt with once and for all by by one sacrifice are we all made perfect and we're going to be going through this and speaking on these scriptures today what Hebrews here is talking about obviously it seems simple is the is the sacrifice that Jesus has made that has broke the curse of sin on our lives once and for all and and it's referencing the sacrifices that have been made ritually down through the Old Testament ever since the fall and it's making it clear that those sacrifices had no power to redeem there was no redeeming power in the blood of bulls and goats and and it had no power to take away sin but this sacrifice of Jesus Christ has perfected us forever amen the the blood has settled the issue of sin once and for all and and we're going to look today at the need for this Blood and if I would title it I would say today perfect blood loosed and empowered perfect blood loosed and empowered and we may go through slow through some of this and maybe in some very Elementary things but I just want to drive this home today to the sacrifice is down through time since the fall had only been a temporary institution God never intended for them to be something that would continue on forever and ever and ever for one thing he didn't want them to continue on because they were completely insufficient in value to pay the price for Humanity they were in some ways their their value was so insufficient that God only looked at it as a placeholder as something to be there in the place of and because the human race had fallen God had placed man on the earth in Eden and and man was given Rule and and what I want to show here is the significance of the debt the significance of what was owed man was given dominion over the earth and the creatures of the earth man was the god of the Earth the Earth was God's work he had created it he had invested himself in it he had thought about each and every detail that it was something God had spent time on he loved this creation he had thought about it from every angle and and he loved it not only man was God's handiwork but all the creation was God's handiwork the Earth was God's work and he would come down in the cool of the evening and he would enjoy the company of man and he would enjoy his creation it was something that he loved and God looked over everything that he had made and he said it's good if God calls something good and by his standards it's something good then it was good amen he had spent all this time making it good and then he turns and he entrusted to man he puts it in the hand of man the thing that he loves and in his workmanship and and he says you rule over it you subdue it you take communion to me I trust you with my creation think about how awful the fall was we always look at it just in terms of man as we should because we are man but everything fail the trust failed the relationship fell man took all that God had made and he took all that God had done the workmanship of his hand the gentleness of the lion the harmony of nature the Bliss of eternal life the perfect communion between God and man and threw it all away and they didn't do this in ignorance it wasn't an accident like oh God I'm so sorry I didn't know man did this in direct Disobedience to the word of God because in Genesis 2 17 it had told them but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die it's written in pretty plain English it was spoken there there was nothing to debate there was nothing to wonder there was nothing of of a gray area they knew if we do this we're throwing it all away if we do this we're allowing death to come in and in that moment Eve made a decision to do this knowing and then and then Adam also taking her unto himself makes the same decision I'm throwing all of this away think of the debt that man owed God think about what he threw away Here and Now sin would rule because not just man fail everything fail the lamb could no longer lay down with the line there was death and sin nature and and death ruled and and sin nature not only now with manifest in the human race but the cruelty of nature itself would now be on full display throughout the world and there was a penalty to be paid there was a debt that was owed because as I said man had not only sold himself but all of creation into slavery and now Satan had rights on man Satan had rights on creation Satan had a claim on them and because of this because Satan now owned man sin and death were now the task Masters that would rule over the Earth and as we read in the word the law required death think of the burden of this debt because the law required death nothing Adam could do would ever pay it off nothing he could do to work it off think about this morning there's nothing you can do to repay God for what he's done for you there's nothing you can do it's not in the works you can do it's just in the mercy and Grace of almighty God we can lay our souls and say Lord I'll give you my life I know it's unworthy I know it's not enough but lord it's all I have to give at least give him all that you have to give Adam can never pay this off because death was the sentence but what we find right here early on is that one of the attributes of God is love one of his attributes is love and God is love and yet he also has to be just and the penalty was death so he couldn't just say you know I forgive you let's move on he is a just God and the law required death but love stepped in to make a way there had to be something that died the law said you have to die the law said in the day you eat thereof that day you die and yet love said I want to make a way but something has to die and the law says something has to die but Mercy says I want to make a way and God's torn there I'm so thankful that in my life when I went astray into sin and to death he the law required that I had to die but he said I want to make a way I want to make a way back and in this moment even though the law required death love stepped in to make a way Mercy stepped in and Grace stepped in when you should have died Mercy stepped in when you should have gone to Hell Grace stepped in when you were lost and without hope God couldn't stand the thought of being separated forever from his children he couldn't stand the thought of not having the fellowship with his children he had created them for this purpose he didn't want to be alone he didn't want to be by himself and now he's sitting there looking at this there they go I'm going to be alone again he wanted to be loved and he wanted to be worshiped and we find out right here in this moment that we serve a very determined God he is not going to give up on the plans that he has he's not going to throw it away and walk away and move on to something else I'm so thankful for that today he's not going to throw you away he's not going to move on to another person he's not going to move on from this bride he created you for a purpose you are to be the Bride of Jesus Christ and if he called you to that then he's not going to throw you away but he's going to see that you fulfilled the purpose that he created you for though you stumble though you fall though you go astray I'm not giving up on her I'm not giving up on them I created them for a purpose when others give up on you he won't when others turn their back on you he won't because he's determined that I'm going to have a bride we have to get our eyes today off of our failures get our eyes today off of our shortcomings and get them back onto the sacrifice that took the place of your shortcomings get them back on the sacrifice that took the place of every one of your sins every one of your trespasses and the blood of Calvary cries out to you this morning no matter where you're at I'm not giving up on you I'm not turning my back on you I'm not going to leave you where you're at this morning brother Aaron I've been struggling I don't know what to turn I feel like I'm failing I feel like I'm failing I'm not giving up on you I have made a way but the blood said something had to Die the law said something had to die it required blood and so he took a lamb and he kills it in their place and it allowed them to live for another day it allowed them to live for a space of time although now sin and death ruled in these mortal bodies brother Brown says God he covered all space in all time bottled down to four little letters l o v e love he could not stand to see his child depart from him you know the thought this comes to me as we speak on love is that's the thing that the devil can't understand that's the thing he'll never understand that may be the thing that you'll never understand about me and the way I deal with my children and I may never understand about you and the way you deal with your children because you have a love for them that I can't understand and I have a love for my children that you might not can understand and in that moment Satan says I got them it's destroyed it's finished they're mine forever oh he looked at you that way and he said I got them I got them in the clutches of sin they'll never be redeemed they'll never be restored I got them in my pawn shop they've turned their back on God they've walked away from his word they've walked away from his promises they're full of nothing but unbelief full of nothing but doubt full of nothing but fear but l o v e he says I got him but God says no I love them they're mine I won't walk away I won't leave them in your pawn shop the devil goes I don't understand they transgress your law he says but I love them he says I can hear him say wait just a minute Adam I will put enmity between the woman's seed and the serpent seed her heel shall bruise his head and his head shall bruise her heel promising a savior notice right here it didn't have anything to do with man it didn't say no Adam here's what you're going to have to do I'm gonna work it out to where you move like this and he said I will put enmity he takes the Covenant upon himself he takes it upon himself to be the Redeemer amen he says I will I'm going to come I'm gonna put enmity listen just hold on to that this morning he said I will come he said I will heal you he said I will deliver you not you have to do this and you have to do that and if you're good enough I will he said I will come and he came he said I'm going to come back and I'm telling you he's on his way if he said it just hold on to it this morning just be ready to receive it just put your trust in it blood was required and and so began the killing of millions of innocent animals as down through time their blood was offered up every year by every individual as a sacrifice for sin and yet no matter how many lambs they killed no matter how many bulls or how many sheep it could never do away with sin no matter what they did Sin and death still ruled brother Branham says now the only thing that the law did they know that an innocent substitute had to die for the guilty that's us we're the guilty that law began back in the Garden of Eden and now they would offer a sheep or a bullock or something and kill it throw the blood out on the Altar and so forth because it was a covering or a substitutionary offering but it could never take away sin because there's not strength enough now listen to this there's not strength enough in an animal's life to atone for a human life because greater is the human life than animal life and we began to recognize that the that that the sacrifice had to be of a certain value the animal life wasn't valuable enough this is scripture it tells us in Matthew 12 12 how much then is a man better than a sheep there is a greater value so so no sheep could ever pay the price of a lost man much less all of humanity all of mankind as a matter of fact you could kill all the sheep and it wouldn't equal one man and so the value doesn't add up the life in no way could could could in any way repair the injury that was done by man in no way could pay the debt in no way could it settle the issue of sin because it was only a shadow of things to come and the Apostle here in Hebrews 10 begins to put the levitical law in its place and and what he's saying here is even though these sacrifices had been done by Divine appointment even though it had been the plan of God even though it had been the program of God they were only designed to cover sin until the true Lamb of God came to take away the sin of the world I'm so grateful today that my sins aren't just covered up I'm so grateful today that they're not still there and there's just a thin layer of paint on top of them but when he came he took away the sins of the world he did away with it he dropped it in his bleach and my sins went all the way back to their accuser and brother Brown says they hit the devil's Square on the head he Bears my sins this morning are you guilty today no sir he's guilty I'm righteous I am forgiven I am cold I think it not robbery to be equal with God because his blood has Sanctified me his blood has purified me I'm no longer guilty I'm Justified but there is a guilty one every sin I committed squarely on the head of the accuser this morning these Shadows were supposed to point people to Jesus the point of it was to point people to Jesus but what happened is the Jews fell in love with the shadow they fell in love with the Shadow and when the substance of the Shadow was sacrificed they still wanted the shadow the substance was there but they loved the shadow they had fell in love with their rituals and their forms and it's where many choose to operate at today is Under The Shadow and when you're under the shadow truths are not clearly discovered and they're surely not completely and fully enjoyed that's what the message came to do in this day is it revealed the substance of the Shadows it put a substance in front of you this is what this was talking about this is what all of this was about maybe you couldn't see it clear here you couldn't see it clear there listen you can put my shadow up on the wall and you can say that's a big guy but as brother Tim has showed us many times as the shadow gets closer and closer and closer and closer it becomes more defined more defined and more clear but no matter how close it gets it's still a shadow until it's revealed what it is making the shadow and then sometimes you were way off with the shadow you knew something was coming but you was way off but now here it stands the problem is many times when you were way off you're unwilling to come around and admit you were way off and you want to stick with your idea stick with what the shadow told you stick with that no no but I saw it I had a revelation this is what it was and he's standing there going it's okay if you didn't see me clearly here I am to reveal myself to you leave the shadow behind and come to the substance this morning leave the shadow of your ideas in the past and come to the reality of the revelation of this word we don't want to continue to worship under a shadow when substance is available like I said the Shadows were a little bit hazy and they're not clearly defined then it leaves room for interpretation and that's exactly why some people love the shadow they love the ability to debate they love the the ability to have their own idea and their own thought on the matter and as long as you're dealing with shadows who's to say they're wrong their idea your idea well this well that and they loved the debate and as long as they operate in Shadows then their opinion still has some validity their opinion still matters so you find people that love the prophecy but hate the Fulfillment they love the books and the tapes and God sent a prophet and the message and the message and when it starts to take skin on it they're like well how dare you because they love the prophecy but they don't like the Fulfillment they love the shadow but they don't love the substance amen so you find that people despite fulfillment look it's exactly what happened with the Pharisees it's exactly where the Pharisees were that they had the Shadows down perfectly they had the Shadows down better than anyone and they couldn't accept the substance of The Shadow there were volumes written about his coming entire chapters and books dedicated to the coming Messiah and they saw that and they followed that shadow perfectly and we sit back and say how in the world did they miss it how in the world it was so obvious you would think that he would have been welcomed you would think that he would have been received you would think that they would recognize him hey look we can't be too hard on them we have people sitting back still debating the very first doctrine of Jesus that you must be born again there's entire books and volumes and quotes upon quotes upon quotes of of that you must be born again there's quotes and volumes in the book that tell us how the holy spirit will act when it comes how it's going to do in the lives of people when it comes and yet we sit back sometimes and give it a reception that would make the reception the Pharisees gave Jesus seem warm you would think the Holy Spirit Come and we would recognize it you would think the Holy Spirit coming we would welcome it and we would say yes Lord Jesus pour it out I see it I see it that's the shadow but now it's here I read about it I've talked about it but now it's here and I want to welcome it but instead we sit back and go well I can't believe the Pharisees didn't recognize Jesus and then he moves through the place and you go emotion Pharisee and you don't welcome it and you don't recognize it you love the shadow you love talking about what it did in the upper room you love talking about what it did in in the ministry of the Prophet but what about when it tries to manifest here and the substance of it begins to move and they can't receive a substance so moving from that these animals the sacrifice of animal life could never make the worshipers perfect or as it says in Hebrews if it did make them perfect then they were coming into those sacrifices they wouldn't continue to do it Hebrews 10 and 1 says can never with those sacrifices wish they offered year by year continually make the comers they're unto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered so as it relates here to atonement and paying the sin that we've already established that they were not sufficient in value to pay off the debt but they were also insufficient in another way that they were not the same nature with man who had committed the sin they were not the same nature of the one who had offended they were not the same nature of the one who owed the debt so that they're not the same nature they were not the nature of the one who had defended nor were they the same nature of the one who had been offended they were neither one they weren't the nature of man they weren't the nature of God they were just an animal and also another thing against the Sheep poor sheep a lot of them gave their life for man but it was insufficient and another thing against the Sheep was that the Sheep could never consent to be killed in the place of the guilty and the atoning sacrifice must voluntarily substitute himself in the place of the guilty think about that for a minute Jesus didn't have to Jesus didn't have to Jesus chose to why why would he choose that you because he loved you because he wanted to fellowship with you because he wouldn't give up on you and Jesus chose to be the sacrifice and we know that the nature of the Lamb being different could not come into the worshiper and change the nature of sin it can never come back on us brother Brown says the man went right back out of the church with the same desire in his heart that he had when he come in because the blood cell of the Lamb was an animal life and not a human life so it could not atone for sin it was only substitutionary it was only a covering so when we say all this and we line up all these things that it had to be it had to be of value it had to be the nature of man but it also had to be the nature of God it also had to be willing man was in an awful place it seemed impossible where is one walking around in the body of a man with the nature of God where is one willing to lay his life down for people he's never met for people who will reject him and turn their backs on him people who will go out and sin even when they knew about where is this person it seems so impossible no animal could do it because they had the wrong nature he didn't have enough value and it couldn't willingly volunteer man himself couldn't do it because there was a value needed that no man could produce why is that because all men were under the penalty of death and so one under the penalty of death could not then die and atone for another under the penalty of death so once again we have another thing that the atonement is going to have to check off it has to be someone not under the penalty of death someone who themselves is not a slave in the old days a slave could not purchase a slave in order to be a redeemer you had to be free it was going to take a perfect blood someone free from Death to pay the penalty of death someone of such value that he was worth all the souls of men someone with the nature of the offender and someone with the nature of the offended someone willing to die and this seems completely impossible and it goes out is there anyone worthy of that price in a human body willing to lay down their life for you is there anyone brother Brown says there's only one thing left that did not fall everything under man had fallen if you think about it even though the lamb was innocent that they sacrificed it was still Fallen creation there was only one thing that had not Fallen that was God so something of that was God in the heavens so something of the heavens had to come down to redeem this creation because there was nothing here that could create it and God's Own love for the World created the character expressed in Christ while that struck me God's love for the World created the character that was expressed in Christ he was God's character he was God's expressed image in him was God God in Christ revealing himself to the world and no love could ever be greater than that love that such a person would become what he did in order to redeem what had been lost that such a person would become what he became to redeem what had threw away everything he had created oh I thank God that he loved me oh for God so loved the world God unwilling that any should perish he left he left Heaven he left his robes he led he left Deacon rotten Humanity perfect sacrifice to be the perfect blood because the law required blood I know I've said this a lot and we're going to keep saying this because I want you to recognize there was only one that could atone for you the blood of sheep couldn't pay it the blood of goats couldn't pay it the blood of a normal man couldn't pay it only the blood of God could redeem man so God himself became flesh because he couldn't do it as a spirit notice for the very same reason that the goats and the Sheep they weren't kin to us they weren't like us so he couldn't come and do it as a spirit he had to take on the nature of man the offender he had to take on that nature that the penalty could be paid but he had to come as one not under the penalty so he had to be a man but he couldn't come like a man he had to be a man but he couldn't be under the penalty of death brother Branham says there had to be another of your kind cut down the Lord Jesus the perfect one and out of his body was beaten with a cat of nine tails across his back beat on the head spit in the face males drove through and pierced in the side and the life of him had to run out in order to be the savior of your life what are you saying I'm saying it had to be the blood of God but it had to be a man it had to have the nature of the offender and the nature of the offended because if you do away here with the Virgin birth and you have him come in the exact same way that you and I came then he was Mortal in the exact same way that you and I are and his blood can no longer atone for us the Virgin birth was absolutely necessary for your atonement it was the only thing that gave him the value needed and removed him from the penalty of death one mortal cannot die for another mortal because in God's eyes the most holy one here is just as guilty as the most sinful one here so your value is no greater the most holy person in this church could not die in atone for the most sinful person in the world because in God's eyes you're all guilty we're all guilty one cannot at home for the other but if he wasn't man then he wasn't Kinsmen it had to be a perfect blood we always talk about it being perfect in the fact that he never sinned and that's true it was perfect blood but it had to be perfect in that he had the value it had to be perfect in that he had the right nature it had to be perfect in that he wasn't under the law of sin and death it had to be perfect in that he was willing it had to be perfect in so many ways that Satan seemed like he had it all stacked up against you surely there isn't one that can come and fulfill all of this I've got good news there was one and he was willing and he was able and his life was valuable enough and it did redeem us and it did places back into position it did call us out of sin and it wasn't just that but there was a life in that blood it wasn't just the blood that loosed us and we'll get more into this later it didn't just loose us but it empowered us so that we no longer have to go back and live in sin go back underneath the curse of the law he came and it was a perfect blood it was a perfect loosing he was a perfect sacrifice he was a perfect Redeemer and therefore you can be made perfect this Blood had to be of the same nature he had to become one of us or as we often say and brother Brown preaches the wonderful message he had to be a Kinsmen Redeemer this was according to the law and Leviticus the the law of redemption in Israel stated that to restore an estate to restore property or to restore a person whatever the case may be it had to be done by a near kin that's why goat couldn't do it a bull couldn't do it that was just one of the things against him is why he a spirit couldn't do it that's why he had to come his flesh so God unable and spirit to be kind to us became kin by taking on human flesh but he was God and brother Brown says we are saved by the blood of God that's where my faith is not walk out there in the blood of a prophet not walk out there in the blood of an ordinary man or a teacher or a theologian we walk there in the blood of God God said so he become human being he changed his strand he stretched his tent here with us and became one of us he is our Kinsmen Redeemer he had to become kin folks to us because that was the law God became man and dwelt Among Us notice in doing this he coming he coming from him was God the spirit and that Spirit becomes upon the believer therefore the life that was in our sacrifice we are identified by that same life the nature of the sacrifice finally has come to a place to where it can come back on the believer there is an opportunity to no longer go out exactly the same way as what you came in there is an opportunity to not only be lose from the guilt and the chains of sin but to now be in power to overcome that sin [Applause] so he becomes Kinsmen I want to look again specifically here at the requirements of a Kinsmen first of all he must be a Kinsman hopefully we knew that to be a Kinsmen you must be a Kinsman what's that mean to be a redeemer you must be related Leviticus is clear that the Redeemer must be related to the one whom he is going to buy back out of slavery that's why we see here Hebrews 2 and 11 says for both he that he Sanctified and they who are Sanctified are all of One for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren in other words he became just like you of the same father it's telling you here we are all of One same father that makes us Kinfolk for which cause he is not ashamed to call you brother it doesn't get much closer than Ken than brother verse 14 says for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same he became your kinfolks he took part in flesh and blood number two he must be free himself a slave was unable to purchase another slave a kinsman redeemer must be himself free of the debt and of the bondage which had fallen on the one who was to be redeemed I love that he had to be free of the bondage and slavery that had fallen on the one that he was there to redeem this is why it couldn't be one of us this is why it couldn't be one under the penalty of death and the only way for this to be possible was the Virgin birth because there was no sin there was no curse there was no claim on the Flesh of Jesus Christ the devil had no claim on it therefore it was free free it was free number three he must be able to pay the price if he did not have the necessary sum of money which was required to pay the purchase price then he would not be able to redeem his relatives he was worth it he was plenty valuable amen his life was more than valuable and four he must be willing to pay the price and make public testimony it wasn't enough to have a Kinsman who was able to accomplish the work of redemption he must also be willing to do it you know how it is you you call up your your uncle who's got lots of money you're like hey I'm I need five hundred thousand dollars he might be more than able to I don't mean he's going to he's probably going to say look you got yourself in this mess you need to work your way out of it or he may say hey I'll tell you what I can give you a little bit I can help you out a little bit this Redeemer didn't help us out a little bit he didn't say I'll give you a little portion it was a complete Redemption I'll buy back everything I'll forgive all your sins I'll save your loss I'll heal your sick I'm willing I'm able I'm capable I'm worth it I'm free and I've come down to redeem that which was lost how much of it Lord all of it what how many of my sins all of them how many of my sicknesses all of that I've come to redeem all of it and the devil couldn't say one thing about it because he had no claim on that flesh the Virgin birth Hallelujah for God so loved the world we have an example of this Kinsmen in the story of Ruth and Boaz you know Ruth is an awesome example to us pardon me lost example because Ruth had every opportunity to quit she had every opportunity to go back and just live the life that she had always lived every opportunity to go back to her people think about it Israel wasn't even her people her sister-in-law left her sister-in-law turned and walked away her mother-in-law who she was looking to for guidance tried to talk her into leaving what would we do I got a pretty absurd question what would you do if brother Tim stood up here and tried to talk you out of the message I only use him because I know y'all would hold him in higher regard than me if I did it y'all be like oh Tomatoes at that man hopefully you'd have the same attitude towards anybody but what if a preacher tried to talk you out of it a friend a relative a website that's why we teach and we preach that you must have your own experience you must meet God for yourself you must know that you know that you know that God is real it must be a revelation to you beyond any head knowledge Beyond mama said beyond on Daddy said it must be an experience on the inside of your heart we've always said it that he who has an experience is not at the mercy of one who merely has an argument if it's head knowledge they can come around and place this story with this story and this place and make anybody and anything look the way they want it to look but when you've met God for yourself when you know that he's real when you've had a backside of the desert experience you try to tell Moses that the burning bush wasn't real you try to tell Peter and 119 more that the upper room didn't happen you try to tell Paul that he wasn't struck down on the road to Damascus it doesn't matter what you try to tell me I was there and I say You Oughta been there you ought to experience it you ought to know it for yourself meet this God for yourself well you can't be talked out of it I won't go back I won't turn around your people will be my people your God will be my God your own experience the devil will try to talk you out of that as years go on as time goes by as the feelings wear off listen we don't base things on our feelings we know that but don't tell me that being in the presence of God don't feel good but when that wears off when you haven't felt it in a while what do I do then that's why I want more today that's why I'm not relying on what God did for me last month what he did 10 years ago I can tell you when I got the Holy Ghost but I'm not relying on just that experience I want more today I want to refill in today I want to experience him today I want it fresh and new when the Devil comes and says it didn't happen I said yeah it did five minutes ago I was there you can't talk me out of it fresh and up to date and bubbling up and flowing over but if it's something from way back when your emotions and your feelings can lie to you that's why we got to have more today and not just more of an experience of jump shouting but more revelation in our souls that's why the prophet would tell you you can never over emphasize the importance of Revelation to a believer y'all know me and I say it all the time I'm all about the Run jump and Shout but there better be an anchor on the inside of your soul there better be a revelation deep down in there that I know that I know that I know that if I don't run and jump and Shout for the next 10 years I know that I know that I know that I know what do you want more of today Aaron more emotional I got plenty of it I want more revelation of who he is and who I am and his plan and what he's done for me and that I'm redeemed I'm gonna make it I'm gonna overcome because he was the perfect blood Ruth can't be talked out of it and so she stays with it and Naomi tells her that Boaz is a close Kinsman and I won't bog down too much here because we all know the story of Ruth and Boaz but Naomi instructs her to go and glean in his field and in following that instruction it's one thing I love about Ruth as you read the book of Ruth you will find that she always follows instructions every time every single time that's a problem a lot of us have is the following of instructions because the death to self-will is the hardest death you'll ever die Gethsemane was a brutal death for Jesus as he died out to self-will one of the biggest parts of being a Christian is being willing to be led we throw that word around very easily but what if I word it differently being the best one of the biggest parts of being a Christian is being told what to do oh we like the word lead oh I was led of the spirit I was late now you were told what to do well I'll tell you what ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do I'm um you're not going to be a very good Christian what is Christianity being told what to do all the time Roots good at being told what to do listen I'm not throwing this out there Joe I need help with that because it's easy sometimes to see what you're supposed to do it's not always easy to do it we got to pray more from this Lord show me your will but Lord when you show me your will give me the strength and the ability to follow that will because it don't always look like the best plan to us but Ruth's always following instructions and so she goes to the field and and she encounters the Kinsmen Boaz and he is the lord of the Harvest in Route 2 and 8 it says then said Boaz unto Ruth here is thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go Thou after them have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art a thirst going to the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn what's Boaz instructing her to do here stay in my field stay in the word stay with what the word is telling you don't go out looking for food outside of this word don't go out looking for food in the denominations outside the revealed word of the hour don't go out there looking to have your needs met somewhere outside of the word listen the word has been opened we've been returned to the land the the book is open and the Kinsman says I've got plenty of food for you right here stay right here in this land don't go out there looking don't get shook up when you can't exactly find what it is and you go look in here and you go look in there think about it now you wander here and you wonder they're looking for answers and that Kinsmen said stay in the field you've got all you need but you've got to stay here if you want to stay under his protection notice he said I've commanded my young men not to touch you but there's nothing there's no jurisdiction in the field next door he says touch not mine anointed that's not talking about preachers you've been anointed you've been anointed in this end time to sit on the throne you've been anointed as the Queen of Heaven and he says touch not mine anointed but what if you wonder outside Hey listen I'm not saying that there ain't some psychologists out there that don't have some good things but are they in the field I'm not saying that Dobson or different ones didn't have some good things I'm not saying that but he said stay in the field and I'll take care of all your needs he said stay in the field brother Branham says people are so tired they're so mentally strained until they're feeling the insane institutions in the hospitals everywhere they went in such a nervous condition till they don't know what they believe and what they want they're just laying there they don't know what to do it's such a sad sight listen here my brother you can't drink it off you can't shout it off neither can you play cars till it's dull you could take a thousand siestas and try to sleep it off and you can't do it all of our little remedies the only thing it does is help the symptoms we've got to have a cure for the disease all the psychiatrists in the world can't cure it it only helps the symptoms The Cure is in the blood of Jesus Christ what's he telling you stay in the field I'm not saying that there isn't something you might can find some barley in that field next door I'm not saying you couldn't I'm saying if you'll stay here you got my protection if you stay here you got my word that will drop your handfuls on purpose you're not going to starve here I'm going to draw water for you I'm going to protect you I'm going to heal you I'm gonna deliver you I'm Gonna Save you I'm going to take care of your every need but stay in my field don't wander off don't get out there and doubt and worry and fear oh no I'm gonna go look over here stay where he planted you the word this morning in my field I've commanded no one touch you in my field I've told them to drop handfuls on purpose prophet of God says I want you Angels you Reapers every once in a while to drop a handful on purpose oh don't let it be so tiresome to her but every once in a while let her hear a good message let a good power of the Holy Spirit come over once in a while to let her know that I'm still there do some kind of a healing amongst her show some kind of a sign or a wonder that she'll know that I'm in her midst our Kinsmen is going to make sure that our needs are supplied if we'll follow directions and we'll stay in its field and we know that Naomi instructs Ruth to go in while he's resting and mark the place where he lays and go lay out his feet now there's all kind of things we can get into right here but this is a perfect example of being willing to do things that may even seem unseemly listen she's a moabite they don't exactly have the best reputation when it comes to moabite women and Israelite men go back to the scriptures what's this going to look like to everybody else brother Branham takes this and types it out into laying your pride down what's it going to look like if I snot on the altar what are people going to think about me if I run and jump and Shout they're going to call me Holy Roller they're going to call me all kind of unseen but if the Bible says You must be born again then whatever comes with that new birth I'm willing to accept it and it may not manifest the same in me as it does in you but I'm going to take whatever he sends no matter how unseeming other people may think it is I'm going to follow the instruction of the word and I'm going to do it and so she goes into him while he's sleeping and Naomi says while he is resting Mark the place where he lays and go lay at his feet church that's beautiful that's beautiful Mark the place where he laid Mark the place where he laid his life down for you have you marked Calvary tonight it says Mark the place where he laid down his life and go in there to there and lay yourself at his feet lay yourself at the feet of where he shed his blood Mark the place where he laid Mark the place in Gethsemane Mark the place in the tomb where he became your Redeemer and go lay your life down at his feet lay your life down there and say Lord cover me up Lord with your blood cover me up Lord with your spirit I don't care what other thing I've come to lay myself down and mark the place where you've laid she says and then he will tell you what to do there we go again Route 3 and 4 and it shall be when he lies down that thou shalt Mark the place where he lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do she says you just get to the Kinsmen get to the Kinsmen and then he's going to tell you what to do whatever you tell me Jesus that's what I'm going to do Wherever You Lead Me Jesus that's where I'm going to go listen he's the Kinsmen he paid the price he died the death he gave up his rights he took the beating he took the lashing he took the whipping he has earned the right to tell you what to do if you want his Redemption we as those in need of being redeeming do not have the right to argue with the Redeemer the only one who has the ability and value and willingness to buy us back our attitude has to be one of just tell me what to do Just Lead Me Lord if he says You must be born again there's no argument we must be born again if he says women should have long hair and men should have short hair who am I to debate that if he says a woman should dress like a lady and not put on a garment that pertains to a man and a man shouldn't put on a garment that pertains to a woman there's nothing to dissect there yes Lord I'll do it he says separate you need to separate from your friends and yes Lord you are the Redeemer you paid the price you died for me whatever it is you say that I will do and it comes back to Ruth being an incredible uh uh example to us because she never argues with Boaz he says stay in the field and she stays prophet of God says Lord I'll take you as my savior if the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that I'll do if the Bible said I must receive the holy ghost that I'll do if the Bible tells me Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that I will believe I'll take the Bible and God for what he's wrote and what he is no matter what anybody else said there's the real Ruth he says there's the real Ruth and once you have done all that the Kinsmen tells you to do then you can rest well brother Aaron how can I rest have you seen what's going on in the world have you seen what's going on around us have you heard what's going on in Russia and there's this other guy he's trying to overthrow Putin in the and there's this going on and and our our president he's not real smart and we got lots of crazy things going on in politics and this and and have you and what's Naomi say to Ruth but but he hasn't settled the issue yet he hasn't redeemed me he hasn't went to the gate yet he hasn't done these things he says rest because I can assure you that he will not rest until the matter is settled what can I do today brother and you can rest because he will not rest until your Redemption is complete he will not rest until you're healed he won't rest till you're delivered he won't rest to your children or called back to the Cross he won't rest till we get a body change he won't rest till there's a Rapture I can rest knowing that he will not rest until his Redemption is totally and completely complete I can rest today it's not me it's him and today I'm just resting in his atonement I'm resting in his Redemption he is my Kinsmen Redeemer he meets the requirements and he's willing so I can rest he's a Kinsman and because we have a Kinsman now there is a hope for even the worst of Sinners because Christ paid a price that was sufficient and suitable to all because it was in our nature it was in our nature brother Brown says remember a redeemer redeems you completely oh brother he's done a lot of works but he hadn't finished he's not okay he's not stopping just rest he's a redeemer he's going to redeem you completely he says when he redeems you it's from your sins from your sickness from everything that's wrong he is a redeemer I say what a redeemer what a blood this was it was a perfect blood lost today he's the Redeemer sick today he's a redeemer depressed today he's a redeemer full of fear and anxiety today he's the Redeemer you got failures and doubts and struggles and and things you fall into over and over and over and over he is the Redeemer he's a perfect Redeemer Satan had the whole estate and he couldn't redeem it we know the story that there was another Kinsman that that wouldn't redeem it and so that allowed Boaz to and Satan wouldn't Satan couldn't but Jesus could and Jesus would not only that but he was willing to make a public testimony Boaz had to make a public showing at the gate and Boaz takes off his shoe and lays it aside and says I have bought her I have redeemed her and I have purchased Ruth to be my wife think about it they're on golgotha's Hill he was stripped down he laid aside more than a shoe he laid aside his pride he laid aside his royalty he laid aside his dignity he laid aside all his power he could have signaled the angels to come and get him off the cross in a moment and he laid it all aside and he made a public testimony he said I've redeemed her and I've redeemed her with a purpose what is that purpose just like Boaz have redeemed Ruth to be my wife he made a public testimony there on Calvary as his Precious Blood spilled and he said I've redeemed her to be my bride I've redeemed her to be my wife I'm making a public show a public testimony I'm throwing aside my robes and I'm testifying I will redeem her I will redeem her I'll lay everything aside and I'll be the perfect blood I'll pay the price for the purpose that she's going to be my bride I love her he says I love her bulls and goats can only cover the sin but the prophet of God tells us that the blood of Jesus Christ divorced it he said it divorce sin his blood was perfect blood and therefore it didn't just covered but it remitted sin here's the word we see all the time for the remission of sins for the remission of sins what does remission mean remission means the cancellation of a debt a charge or a penalty even like Tabernacle you are debt free today it has been remitted it has been canceled it has done away with when the Devil comes and he says you owe me this you owe me that you oh listen you don't got to break into some theological sermon on the godhead and explain to him the Seven Seals you can point him right back to Calvary and say My Redeemer has come he has paid the price the debt is clear I don't owe you one thing I say save the receipt pull the receipt out on him the store says you owe us this you know I got a receipt I've got a receipt this morning I owe you nothing the debt is cleared it was a perfect blood a cleansing blood a redeeming blood I don't owe him anything debt-free feels good to be debt free bulls and goats couldn't do it religion couldn't do it saying you believe the message couldn't do it it's just a covering but this Blood was a cleansing blood when morality escaped you when he had a claim on you When sin had you bound there was an atonement made for you what was it I just wanted to be as real to you as it was to me as I studied this it was the blood of God the blood of God who am I what am I is there any worthiness In Me Is there any righteousness in me is there anything I did to deserve enough I was part of Adam's race that threw it all away blood of God came and said I'll be Kinfolk I'll be the Redeemer that was an atonement oh come on there was an atonement made for you there was a blood shed for you and it was the blood of God and when you cross through the Red Sea of the blood of Jesus when you cross through that Red Sea then you look back in behind you you can see every sin every claim every failure everything you ever committed you see it dead in the blood of Jesus I'll tell you what it's no wonder Moses got caught up in the spirit it's no wonder Miriam grabbed the tambourine you talk about debt free not only am I debt free it can never come back it can never bother me again it has no hold what is it the blood of Jesus wiped it clean it took my accuser It cast it down it took the Taskmaster and it took the whip from his hand and it Set Me Free To Worship Him no wonder they got in the spirit no wonder they rejoiced no wonder they shout I'm free I'm free I'm free today oh a redeeming blood has set you free it's a perfect blood for a perfect loosing brother Brown says no wonder Moses gotten the spirit you talk about having some some kind of new religion look at this Miriam a prophetess she looked out there she picked up a tambourine and she began to beat and dance and she went down the banks of the sea dancing and beating this tambourine and the daughters of Israel followed her I've always found that very interesting when people say well they just did it because others were doing it yes what the scripture says they all did it because Miriam did it join in take that for what it's worth they followed her dancing and singing and beating this tambourine and Moses raised up his hands and got so caught away in the Holy Ghost till he sung in the spirit Hallelujah that's right that's right that same Holy Ghost was on Moses it's in this building tonight Hallelujah same one that made marry him dance is here tonight God is God and he changes not yes sir then you say look at that bunch of fanatics this struck me because I haven't yet seen a service quite like this seen some powerful Services I've seen a lot of people get carried away in the spirit but I've never seen it to where every single person was he says but there wasn't anybody to make fun of them because they was all gone they had it all to themselves there wasn't anybody making fun now I understand the reference there they was always referencing the Egyptians but notice there was no one making fun they had it all to themselves there wasn't one person in the seat of the scornful you know God does a lot of Mighty things in spite of us sometimes he moves a lot of times when most of us are in one mind in one Accord to where every single human being in here was in one mind and one Accord I'll answer for you no I doubt We've Come Close and think of what God has done in our midst what could he do it's not that much of a sacrifice to lay aside your feelings towards people your feelings of the week behind and the week of head for a couple hours you can be mad again when you leave but for a couple hours lay all that aside and say God move God deliver God heal God help my listen here's the problem we got to put ourselves in the seat of the guilty sometimes instead of God help that brother God help me love that brother help me lay down my feelings towards that brother and then we incidentally ruined it by going because you know how he did me no just help me love him help me you know something I've been saying a lot lately how about you worry about you and if we can get to that place where we all worry about us then you won't have nobody else to worry about the problems will take care of themselves it'll allow God to move more freely when you look around and you realize that I don't owe the devil one thing my debt has been cleared my debt is wiped clean that's why it says there is and therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus quit wallering around in the accusations of the enemy Walling around in your so-called unworthiness and listening to the accusations and worst of all agreeing with them yeah I'm no good yeah I failed again none of us are any good all of us fail all the time the difference is some people look at the sacrifice and some people look at themselves and if you keep looking at yourself you're not going to make it what do I got to do what do I got to do look through the blood put it in the blood lay it all in the perfect cleansing blood and be perfectly loosed because listen it it said there's there for now no condemnation it didn't say there is now therefore no accusations the accusations and the trials and the hardships and the doubts and the things will always be there they're not going away he said there is now therefore no condemnation in other words the accusation is cast out there is no guilt proclaimed over you you never did it in the first place amen listen I I don't know where you're at tonight I don't know what situation you're in I don't know how dark it is I don't know how unmentionable the Deeds of your past may be but you're not condemned there's a message going forth this morning telling you that there's a perfect blood that was for your perfect cleansing for your perfect losing losing and it's not that you're perfect it's that your sacrifice is amen through the power of this perfect blood you are Justified what's that mean you never did it in the first place and now because the nature of this blood and this is what we've been dealing with with the Kinsmen the nature of this Blood because it's from a Kinsmen not only are you loosed but you are empowered it's not only a losing but there has to be an empowerment that comes with it brother Brown says that's right Jesus Christ the son of God come down to bring life to the human race is that right and in him after his blood being shed and the Holy Spirit coming in the blood of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit coming in the blood of Jesus Christ which was that blood cell when it was offered at Calvary it takes away the very desire of sin do you see that when the life is formed it's a spirit in the blood cell and when the worshiper offered the blood of the lamb and that cell broke it was just acting in the place of the real then when the worshiper put his hands upon the lamb and its throat was cut and its hands was bathed red as the little lamb kicked dying and finally straightened out and was gone the worshiper went right back out with the same desire to commit adultery lie still that he ever had why the blood cell when it was broke the life in that blood cell was animal life and it can't come back onto human life but when the Son of God when that blood cell was broke the holy spirit that was on him comes back onto the worshiper oh Hallelujah that's the Crux of the whole thing that's the whole thing right there you offer sacrifice upon sacrifice upon sacrifice and yet sin Reign and death Reign because nothing changed but with one sacrifice with one life that a blood cell could break and release the Holy Spirit The Same Spirit that was on the inside of him now can come back on the inside of you and you're not just loosed you're not just loose but you're empowered to never go back to bondage again that's what it's all about that's why this sacrifice was special it was a perfect losing and an empowering amen every year had been the same thing sacrifice and no changed sin and death still ruling sin covered temporarily but when you come through this blood it's more than a covering because there's a life in the blood that will Empower you to go out of here a different person if you failed and you failed and you failed I'm telling you there's a blood here today with a life in it that'll not only forgive you but it will fill you and Empower you to be an overcomer amen I want to deal with this for a little bit and we won't be too much longer don't be happy just being loosed don't be happy with just a loosing don't stop at just being set free because the whole point of him coming in a human to pay the debt is so that his Spirit could come and live on the inside of you what are you saying don't be loosed be empowered be loosed and empowered because I want to ask you a question what good is the losing if we continually go back to be chained up again what good is the losing if we continue to go back to the same sins that so easily beset us what good is the losing if we continually run right back out into debt again and we actually end up worse than we were before the loosing but it happens to people all the time because they stop at the losing I've seen it Time After Time After Time it's where you pray with people in the power of God Don't Make Any mistake about it the power of God falls on them and loses them and they're free and there's a shout and a dance as it should be we should always celebrate every victory but they think that's it and that was a loosing and they don't carry on and push through to get the empowering to become endued with power from on high like they knew they had to have in the upper room and so what happens Matthew 12 43 says when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none then he saith I will return into my house from whence I came out and when he has come he find that the empty swept and garnished it's been clean something happened there's no denying what happened we mistook what it was that happened is cleaned out then go with he and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of the man is worse than the first I believe we've witnessed many powerful loosings and we see that they don't always lead to a Victorious Life afterwards because the person never became empowered the life of the sacrifice is never allowed to completely overtake the worshiper and the person actually ends up worse than they were to begin with brother Branham says it like this the same thing exists today it will happen it does happen there is Devils but Jesus cast them out and he gave his church authority to do so cast out devils in my name do we all agree with this stay with me for a few more minutes here cast out he says Devil's in my name he cast Seven Devils out of the Pretty Woman one day and he said when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walks in dry places returning back then bringing seven other Devils with him now that goes to show that if the man was cleansed of devils there was something was in him had gone out a loosing okay a devil had gone out now when the devil moved out God gives an opportunity for God to move in so when he goes out let the Holy Spirit come in don't just leave it there if you do now listen to this this struck me so strong if you do just repent of your s then you're going to be worse off than ever if you just repent and get loosed and get free and go on watch out you'll be worse off than you ever were before he says but get that place where Satan once lived and occupied get it filled with the holy spirit of God and then you'll have the strength of God's word in you manifested and cast out Devils contest is on the evening lights are shining God's holy spirit is present I believe if we sit here for a minute and think about it we've all witnessed this exact same thing and for some it's even been a stumbling block because we see something take place we see a moment where someone has an encounter or deliverance and we rejoice in it and as I said we always will and always should but then as time passes on not only does that person go back to their old ways but they go back even worse than they were before the experience and the first thing that people want to do is to go back to that moment in the church or go back to that moment at camp or go back to wherever it took place and cast doubt upon the validity of what happened or was it even God I think they just got really emotional they got really excited and did you see how those preachers had their hands on and they got excited and they began to jump around me of course and they began to cast doubt on the Supernatural and the validity of it well that wasn't really God no it was a victory it was a loosing and a victory that was worth celebrating but they stopped short of being filled with the Holy Ghost is very clear in the scriptures very clear in the message they stopped short of being endued with power they didn't progress further enough and make sure that the seal was there that would give them power when the devil came back to try to get back inside even in like Tabernacle we can never stop short don't ever get tired of hearing the ministry preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost we must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we must get it for ourselves we must get it for our children we must lead them to it we must preach it we must offer it we must have the atmosphere for it we must celebrate every Victory they have along the way to get to it celebrate their victories celebrate each and every step they take but don't stop short of the infilling or the empowerment of the baptism of the Holy Ghost we must always not just preach the Forgiveness of sins but we must preach the life and the power of the blood not just a loosing but an empowering he did not pay the price so that we could just be church members he didn't pay the price of redemption so we could go in and out and back and forth and stumble and fall in and out but he paid the price so that the life of the blood the life of the sacrifice could come back on the inside of each and every one of us and where he overcame we overcome where he cast out Devils we cast out Devils where he rose above sin We rise above sin and where he conquered death We Will Conquer death and take a Rapture because we are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and because of that that life can come on the inside of this life don't stop short of that we must always preach the Holy Ghost break the cycles and trample over sin like he did he said go in sin no more go and sin no more there was an empowerment so you let that life be born in you to where it's no longer you but it's Christ that liveth in man can't stop short can't stop short can't be happy with the loosing I'm happy to be loosed but I got to press on into an empowerment you see that all down Through the Ages we spoke about it in individuals but look at it in a broader sense look at it in the church world the churches that believed on Christ but stopped short of the new birth what happened we talked about it in an individual but think about the church world the church went from The Upper Room to the cage of every unclean and hateful burden early on they pressed forward to the new birth but when they stopped and it became about ritual and form and just accept the word and they stopped pushing for the New Birth the next thing you know look at them there look at them now and tell me they're not exponentially worse than they were and we find every church that stops short of the new birth is in a worse condition now than when they came out of the Catholic Church when they came out they were the move of God when they came out they were on fire when they came out they had the word for the hour but look where they're at now exponentially worse brother Brown says you can be sanctified and not have the Holy Ghost right Sanctified Spirit without being filled sanctifying your heart cleansing your heart without filling it with something that's what he said when the unclean spirit is going out of the man he walks in dry Places come back finds his house all garnished and comes in the last estate of that person is many times seven times worse than it was at the first that's what happened to the pilgrim holiness to the nazarenes and so forth you accepted and when the Holy Ghost come and begin to speak in tongues and give signs and wonders you called it the devil and blasphemed the works of God Called It an unclean thing and you see where your church went they were loosed from the Catholic system but they never let the Holy Spirit Empower them what are we preaching today a perfect blood loosed and empowered because this Blood provides for you a loosing and it also provides for you a power to never be bound again like Tabernacle I say take advantage of it take advantage of the empowering quit living below your privileges quit walking around just as church members quit walking around beat down and cage down you've been loose now be empowered and if you've been empowered be empowered again if you've had an experience have another experience if you've got God on the inside get more of God on the inside don't just be loose this morning but be loose and push forward until you're completely empowered it's the life of the blood that we're after it's the life of the blood that we need it's the life of the bloodstream that can put us back in fellowship with where we were before the fall think about the attitude of well we're all going to sin a little and we all have things that we can't overcome that's saying that the blood of Jesus is no more efficient than the blood of bulls and goats you're putting it on the same level if we're going to continue and sin then why did Jesus die why don't we just go kill a goat that's a denominational Viewpoint it's an attitude that declares the the power of the blood isn't enough but I'm here today to declare to you that it was a perfect blood it was a perfect blood the prophet of God tells us in this this quote is where the thought for this service came from so I want you to hang on this with me when I read this it was just so powerful to me it says consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete there is now therefore no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation How can there be there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free Guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood now don't get tied down again by traditions and Creeds and organizations don't get LED astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus saves heals fills with the Holy Ghost in power you are God's free men loosed by his own blood listen if the blood is perfect then the works of that blood is perfect Therefore your salvation is perfect your Holy Ghost is perfect your deliverance is perfect your healing is perfect it is complete because it's a perfect loosing and because it's a Kinsmen it can come back on the inside and he has redeemed you perfectly listen he didn't stop short in his Redemption he didn't stop short he thought of everything he covered every angle he covered every aspect of repayment going so far as to go to hell for you that bull could die but it couldn't redeem you that goat could die but it couldn't go to hell for you but this one having a soul like you having a human nature meeting all the requirements of the Kinsmen went into the belly of hell and conquered he battled every demon here and there think about it he faced depression in hell and conquered it he faced fear in hell and conquered it he faced suicide spirits and conquered them he was attacked by lust and came out of hell pure think about that he went down into hell in every grimy every evil every slimy every hateful Spirit began to come up and rub up against them why was he there paying the price for you why was he there in the pits of hell so you wouldn't have to go but I got good news this morning he didn't stay there because there was a word that said I will not leave his soul in Hell or allow my Holy One to seek corruption he had to resurrect on the third day and why did he do that because he had to ascend and why did he do that because he had to send back the baptism of the Holy Ghost the life of the perfect blood so you could be perfectly loose so you could be perfectly empowered oh he didn't just come and die but he sent back his life why so that I could overcome like he did so that I could be victorious like he was Victorious it's a perfect loosing tonight it's a perfect loosing so you could walk in Victory brother Aaron will I not war anymore yeah your War you'll battle you'll face tests and trials and tribulations but because of a perfect blood you're overcoming will be perfect because greater is he that is in you a Kinsman than he that's in the world it's only possible because he became Kinfolk it's only possible because he became sin we can only even speak about these things because he loved us so much and his love was so far greater that he said it's going to take a perfect blood I'll go I'll go I'll be the Kinsman I'll be made sin I'll die the death I'll go to hell I'll pay the debt even like Tabernacle you're debt free you're debt-free you don't got to pay one thing just dip your soul in the perfect blood of Jesus the perfect Redeemer the perfect atonement I got things bothering me run it through the Red Sea of the blood of Jesus Christ this morning and watch those things break off your life will you stand together with me this morning brother Branham says I tell the truth in Christ Allah not there's no man can take the doctrine that I preach and disprove it there's no one can do it I have never seen anyone could do it because it's the gospel truth the discernment of the spirit is perfect no man can ever say that it's not ever been perfect that's a pretty good way to start a statement I'm going to have faith in what it is he says right here and I tell you now there's a perfect place there's a perfect heaven there's a perfect God a perfect savior a perfect blood a perfect atonement a perfect being for you I accept it Jesus I'm not going to wallow in my failures I'm not going to wallow in my unbelief but Lord today I accept it and by accepting that he says you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ I say hallelujah you are perfect through the blood of Jesus Christ what a redeemer what a blood what a loosing what an empowerment when it seemed impossible he said I'll do it I'm worthy I'm free and he came to Lucius celebrate your freedom celebrate your freedom here we are on the weekend of the Fourth of July I'm
