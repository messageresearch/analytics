[52:20] devil amen I tell you what he's been
[52:23] taking the word of God and backing him
[52:25] up ever since

[52:37] has provided for us we are thanking God
[52:40] for allowing us to gather and honor him
[52:42] for these great Provisions that he has
[52:45] given us and I thought about it today as
[52:48] we bought this property back in 2013 and
[52:52] started building and God provided
[52:54] Miracle after miracle and I'm announcing
[52:57] tonight that God is not through doing
[53:00] the
[53:01] miraculous amen I'm announcing that
[53:04] there's victory over your
[53:07] enemies
[53:09] Hallelujah and I am
[53:12] prophesying that the enemies who have
[53:15] troubled you will trouble you no more
[53:18] amen that every service you will hear
[53:21] this weekend will prophesy you into
[53:24] Victory amen
[53:27] you know the brother Bram said about the
[53:29] false prophet he said he he prophesies
[53:31] people into the tribulation well we're
[53:34] we're prophesying by the word of God
[53:36] people into a
[53:38] Rapture amen now you may have forgotten
[53:41] the victory's past but we should
[53:43] remember like David you know he
[53:45] remembered the bear and the lion fell in
[53:47] defeat and so would the Goliath before
[53:50] him and so will your enemy fall before
[53:53] you and in moments of trouble with we
[53:56] sometimes get like Israel when they were
[53:58] slaves down in Egypt they forgot the god
[54:01] of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and The
[54:04] Marvelous Deeds that he did to their
[54:06] fathers or for their fathers and you
[54:09] know the Troubles of years of bondage
[54:11] had had overwhelmed them and they had
[54:13] forgotten his power and forgotten his
[54:16] Works brother brandham said in the
[54:19] message Victory Day that's what's the
[54:21] matter with the church today we've too
[54:23] long forgotten that Jesus Christ is a
[54:26] same yesterday today and forever we
[54:28] forgot that God as a Healer can make the
[54:31] sick well we forgot the baptism of the
[54:34] Holy Ghost was poured out upon the
[54:36] disciples and was given from generation
[54:38] to generation for anybody whosoever will
[54:43] could come we have forgotten that long
[54:46] ago then he speaks on about Moses went
[54:49] down and he said he had to get his
[54:51] glasses focused and I'm just want to say
[54:54] this that's what we are here for this
[54:56] week we're going to focus right on the
[54:59] Promises of God cuz we're right here in
[55:01] the last day amen and so he went down
[55:04] after he got his glasses focused you
[55:07] know how he did that he met with a
[55:08] pillar of fire anden he heard the voice
[55:11] of God was sent with a commission he got
[55:14] his glasses focused and he seen that it
[55:16] was God's program what he was to do he
[55:19] went down he fought hard he had many
[55:21] great battles one of his great trying
[55:24] battles he said I'd like to bring it
[55:25] when he had
[55:27] um achieve by showing signs and wonders
[55:29] by different things that God had spoke
[55:32] to him and showed him to speak the word
[55:34] and it would become material and happen
[55:37] same thing we have today speak the word
[55:40] over the sick and watch it heal and do
[55:43] these other things that God's word spoke
[55:46] through human lips you say to this
[55:47] mountain and be moved and don't doubt it
[55:50] but believe what you said will come to
[55:52] pass you can have what you said Jesus
[55:54] said so now we believe that and hold to
[55:56] it and take it and believe it so the
[55:59] word this weekend will be spoken and it
[56:02] will go over the audience and and over
[56:06] the people and they will be healed they
[56:08] will be saved they will be delivered
[56:10] they will be filled with the Holy Ghost
[56:13] we will be revived and we're going to
[56:14] leave from here

[1:05:16] greatly and when he was come in he saith
[1:05:20] unto them why make ye this ad do why
[1:05:24] weep and then Dam D is not dead but
[1:05:30] sleepeth the damsel is not dead but
[1:05:33] sleepeth and they laughed him to
[1:05:36] scorn can you imagine now you're coming
[1:05:38] to a set of meetings you've got a
[1:05:41] request on your heart might have told a
[1:05:43] friend or a family member said I'm going
[1:05:46] to church God's going to meet me at
[1:05:49] church and they laugh in their heart

[1:05:55] you're the impossible the word of God

[1:06:42] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:06:44] may have your seats
[1:06:55] various needs amongst
[1:06:57] us we're ready for a
[1:07:00] Rapture we're not just coming to church
[1:07:03] but we're coming to come with a
[1:07:06] purpose that God wants to meet us
[1:07:09] individually God wants to get a hold of
[1:07:11] young men and young ladies that have not
[1:07:14] had an experience with God let the Holy
[1:07:16] Ghost fall meet their heart's need and
[1:07:19] awaken them to the realities of Christ
[1:07:23] once you get that spark or that fire
[1:07:26] you will never ever be the same again
[1:07:29] you say how can you say that preacher
[1:07:31] because when I was 21 God lit my lights
[1:07:34] saved my soul and I've never been the
[1:07:37] same
[1:07:40] again yes but you got weaker as you got
[1:07:43] older no sir this word has unfolded
[1:07:47] greater than at any other
[1:07:49] time in my life God's not weak he strong
[1:07:56] and in my weakness
[1:08:03] then a lot of times we we try to muster
[1:08:07] up our own
[1:08:09] strength and we say well we can do
[1:08:12] it I'm going to do this I'm going to
[1:08:16] meet it but I want you to remember in
[1:08:18] why Christ speak brother Braham said it
[1:08:21] was him that said to me speak
[1:08:25] that's right that's what we need to be
[1:08:27] in tune with God so that when he says
[1:08:31] something to you you're not going on
[1:08:33] your own authority you're going on the
[1:08:35] word Authority he said when those
[1:08:38] squirrels were were spoken into
[1:08:40] existence it was him that said how many
[1:08:43] when the little fishy was dead it was
[1:08:44] him that said raise up the little fishy

[1:08:50] prophet huh for sister hadie

[1:08:56] you can have your sister's
[1:08:58] healing but it was him that said ask

[1:09:04] power or his own Revelation it was God
[1:09:07] that revealed the word to

[1:09:44] Pentecostal

[1:09:48] that the word has unfolded and as you've
[1:09:52] heard over the years this seven seal is
[1:09:55] unveiled and it was the opening of the
[1:09:57] word that gives us power it's not our
[1:10:00] ability it's the open word which is
[1:10:04] Christ amen so anything you desire When
[1:10:07] you pray you can have what you
[1:10:09] ask it's true brother Tim he said if you
[1:10:12] say to the mountain be removed cast into
[1:10:15] the sea you say not the preacher not the
[1:10:19] Deacon truste or Elder it's it you say
[1:10:24] we're getting to the place SS of God
[1:10:26] where the Prophet said when she realizes
[1:10:28] who she
[1:10:32] is I'm sorry I'm quot as I've said both
[1:10:35] other places I will quote the message
[1:10:38] this is what I put my life
[1:10:40] for there's no other message but this
[1:10:44] message you eat the message you consume
[1:10:47] it
[1:10:50] daily
[1:10:52] Hallelujah yes sir he relied on what the
[1:10:57] word said he did he relied on what the
[1:11:01] word told who he was he knew he was
[1:11:05] Messiah Malachi 4 knew he was Malachi 4
[1:11:09] come on the bride knows who she
[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:16] is this is the greatest event that's
[1:11:19] ever taken place Satan is being
[1:11:22] crushed come on put him under your feet
[1:11:25] tonight don't be a wimper don't be a
[1:11:28] wishbone have a
[1:11:30] [Applause]
[1:11:35] backbone I hope this happens and I hope
[1:11:37] that
[1:11:39] happens no that that is a useless
[1:11:42] English
[1:11:43] word it's
[1:11:46] useless faith hope and charity if you
[1:11:50] look at the word hope it is not hope
[1:11:54] like the English language I hope it
[1:11:56] happens but if you got the hope of the
[1:11:59] scripture that's an Earnest expectation
[1:12:02] that it's going to take place so I
[1:12:05] wonder what your expectation is tonight
[1:12:07] God's going to save me God's going to
[1:12:09] deliver me God's going to Grant my
[1:12:11] heart's desire
[1:12:13] tonight amen I I heard a pastor tonight
[1:12:17] said you're going to have Victory well
[1:12:19] then you got to believe who you are
[1:12:22] Jesus believed what the word said he was
[1:12:25] can't we believe what the word says you
[1:12:28] are and saints that lays there we read
[1:12:31] it sometimes
[1:12:34] sometimes we forget about it but when
[1:12:37] you read it next time underline it
[1:12:39] Circle it put it on your desk do
[1:12:42] whatever you want to do because those
[1:12:43] are key thoughts those are key thoughts
[1:12:46] he had to believe what the word said he
[1:12:49] was so the word had to believe the word
[1:12:53] hello we are the word made flesh today
[1:12:56] this is what the scripture says then you
[1:12:59] have to believe what the word says you
[1:13:01] are my children aren't saved ask my
[1:13:05] wife's not delivered ask my wife need or
[1:13:08] my husband needs a holy ghost

[1:29:05] 22 and read verse
[1:29:08] 16 I jesus sent my angel to testify unto
[1:29:12] you these things in the churches I am
[1:29:15] the root and offspring of David I'm the
[1:29:18] bright and morning star and the spirit
[1:29:21] and the
[1:29:22] bride what is they say the same thing
[1:29:27] she's speaking his
[1:29:29] language so I say to you tonight if
[1:29:31] you're not born again come if you need
[1:29:34] the Holy Ghost
[1:29:39] come if you need Victory
[1:29:42] come if you've been around this message
[1:29:44] for even a month and have no Victory I
[1:29:47] doubt your
[1:29:49] experience I'm going to trip over that
[1:29:51] thing but you know what SS of God that's
[1:29:53] why you you need to be filled with God
[1:29:56] in a secret place there in the spirit
[1:29:59] beholding his
[1:30:02] face it's very important not to learn
[1:30:06] the
[1:30:09] message oh and people they can quote you
[1:30:13] under the table and they can say this
[1:30:15] the prophet said this and the prophet
[1:30:17] said that says I'm not interested even
[1:30:19] what you're saying he said I'm
[1:30:22] interested in your life
[1:30:25] amen that nullifies the knowledge of
[1:30:28] carnal man but there is a knowledge that
[1:30:31] comes from above and that's the kind of
[1:30:34] knowledge we want and that knowledge
[1:30:36] will
[1:30:37] translate you into another
[1:30:41] kingdom because your voice and your body
[1:30:44] have to match your
[1:30:47] theophany and I want to ask you are you
[1:30:49] listening or hearing from your theophany
[1:30:51] tonight well you say that's a big word
[1:30:54] Tom and I get confused with that you
[1:30:55] don't need to get confused let me help
[1:30:56] you with this okay theophany if you die

[1:35:16] to be draw back up again Hallelujah a
[1:35:21] prophet tells us that little story and
[1:35:23] who is this mount kzdc a very important
[1:35:27] message you say oh that's a cute little
[1:35:29] analogy no that's my analogy that's why
[1:35:32] I came down then the sun came and it
[1:35:35] started beating on me but one day one
[1:35:39] day when that light so shines I'm going
[1:35:41] to raise up into the Heavenly places in
[1:35:44] Christ
[1:35:45] Jesus yes sir oh my you know what now
[1:35:49] this is Brother Tom brother Tim can
[1:35:51] correct me and forgive me and all that
[1:35:54] sort of
[1:35:55] stuff thanks brother Tim I hate a weak
[1:35:59] need
[1:36:01] lukewarm message believer I'm sorry I'm
[1:36:05] sorry I'm sorry I don't know maybe
[1:36:09] you're still coming because there's
[1:36:11] still hope all right and I not the hope
[1:36:14] of leod deia but the hope of the
[1:36:16] scripture that there's an Earnest
[1:36:19] expectation for a
[1:36:22] completion not that you might get it but
[1:36:25] you're going to get it so keep
[1:36:29] persevering keep being
[1:36:31] [Applause]
[1:36:34] persistent
[1:36:39] amen there had to come a day when we
[1:36:42] would hear his voice the word hearing
[1:36:45] that voice and become aware of our
[1:36:48] father calling us and recognizing that
[1:36:52] we're the sons of God God we heard his
[1:36:55] voice we cried out as did the prodal son
[1:36:59] save me oh my father I'm returning to
[1:37:03] thee that's all you have to do
[1:37:06] tonight I don't need to see your hand
[1:37:09] but I'd lift it if I was you brother
[1:37:11] Bram said that was actually a
[1:37:13] supernatural act to do that you're
[1:37:15] showing that you're Defying Gravity and
[1:37:18] you're letting God know here I am here I
[1:37:22] am
[1:37:24] [Music]
[1:37:26] Hallelujah now if you want to turn to it
[1:37:28] you don't have to but it's Daniel 4:31
[1:37:31] don't need to it's just a short verse
[1:37:34] while the word was in the king's
[1:37:38] mouth well the word was in the king's
[1:37:42] mouth there fell a voice from Heaven
[1:37:46] well I want to say and when they heard
[1:37:49] the voice out of the Queen's mouth
[1:37:55] there came down a voice from
[1:37:58] heaven now do you how many here think it
[1:38:00] was just brother
[1:38:03] brownon no good because it
[1:38:07] wasn't it wasn't that was God using the
[1:38:12] vessel so then when that word came the
[1:38:16] Bible said there fell a voice from
[1:38:19] heaven now that voice that was crying to
[1:38:22] that King was a
[1:38:24] correction you can read the chapter uh
[1:38:27] Daniel 4 when you get home but when that
[1:38:29] voice comes down to you and me it's to
[1:38:32] raise you up from where you came from so
[1:38:35] that word in the Hebrew it means cap
[1:38:39] batco it means now the voice which is
[1:38:42] being
[1:38:43] revealed that voice revealed is a Divine
[1:38:47] will of
[1:38:49] God so you think it's just the voice but
[1:38:53] the Hebrew Hebrew says when that voice
[1:38:55] comes down from heaven it's the Divine
[1:38:57] will of God for
[1:39:00] us so it's not something you put on a
[1:39:02] shelf it's actually something you
[1:39:05] consume because the voice came down the
[1:39:08] word is unfolded and you said give me
[1:39:11] the
[1:39:12] book and the angel said take the book
[1:39:16] then the John said give me the book amen
[1:39:19] and that's a little bit of desperation
[1:39:21] there give it to me that's give it to me
[1:39:25] that I might consume the
[1:39:27] word amen because it's the Divine will
[1:39:30] of God for us amen I know that gets a
[1:39:33] little bit squeaky but it's true
[1:39:36] nevertheless because it wasn't our voice
[1:39:38] that came down it was God's voice that
[1:39:39] came down as John the Baptist forrun the
[1:39:42] first coming of Christ your message will
[1:39:44] forun the second coming of Christ that
[1:39:46] was not William brandom's voice that was
[1:39:49] the voice of almighty God that was that
[1:39:51] Pillar of Fire moving
[1:39:56] praise be to God a voice fell from
[1:39:59] heaven came from heaven and was heard or
[1:40:02] it preceeded from Heaven it's a heaven
[1:40:06] relation a revelation of the Divine will
[1:40:08] of God given to the believer as one
[1:40:11] speaking in the first person it's God
[1:40:14] speaking through the
[1:40:16] prophets God speaking in the first
[1:40:21] person that's right wow

[1:53:13] we come to these special
[1:53:18] meetings 1 Thessalonians 4:13 I would
[1:53:21] not have you ignorant Brethren ignorant
[1:53:23] Brethren concerning them that are asleep
[1:53:25] but ye shall not sorrow even as others
[1:53:28] which have no hope for we believe that
[1:53:30] Jesus died and rose again even so them
[1:53:34] which are asleep in Jesus God will bring
[1:53:37] with
[1:53:38] him for this we say unto you by the word
[1:53:42] of the
[1:53:43] Lord not the word of a man but the word
[1:53:46] of the Lord that we which are
[1:53:50] alive and remain yes unto the coming of
[1:53:54] the Lord shall not prevent them that are
[1:53:57] asleep for the Lord himself shall
[1:54:01] desend now we know the scripture but I'm
[1:54:04] saying Israel's in their
[1:54:06] land Israel's fighting for their
[1:54:08] existence God's turning from the
[1:54:10] Gentiles to
[1:54:12] Israel come on brother Tim and I we were
[1:54:15] speaking in the car Russia wants to push
[1:54:17] the button North Korea wants to push the
[1:54:20] button but God's holding it off maybe
[1:54:23] for that one that's here this weekend M
[1:54:26] would he do that yes he would if God Can
[1:54:29] Count
[1:54:31] 144,000 and not one would be lost uh-huh
[1:54:35] surely your name that's written in the
[1:54:37] book he is not going to lose
[1:54:44] you no sir for the Lord himself shall
[1:54:48] descend from heaven with a shout well we
[1:54:51] know the shout was the prophet
[1:54:52] is that right we know that we're in the
[1:54:55] coming then yeah it's say we're not oh
[1:54:58] I'm waiting for the coming of this great
[1:55:00] Millennial Day Saints we're in that
[1:55:03] we're in it and if you aren't in it I
[1:55:06] would get in real quick I wouldn't
[1:55:10] delay that's right I wouldn't
[1:55:14] delay for the Lord himself shall descend
[1:55:16] with a shout and the voice of the
[1:55:19] Archangel which is the voice of the
[1:55:21] Resurrection
[1:55:23] and the Trump of God shall
[1:55:25] sound say we're we're living
[1:55:28] it oh we thought the Messiah was to come
[1:55:32] we thought John was to
[1:55:34] come and what did Jesus say John is
[1:55:37] already
[1:55:38] come but I say unto you that he shall
[1:55:42] come that blows the minds of the
[1:55:44] theologians but a seventh grade educated
[1:55:47] Prophet takes that scripture of Matthew
[1:55:50] 11 and lets them know
[1:55:53] is that
[1:55:55] right Matthew 1711 I believe is that
[1:55:58] right somewhere in there it's in the
[1:56:00] Bible go read your
[1:56:06] Bible check me out fact check
[1:56:08] me don't worry I get it at home all the
[1:56:12] time I'll say some story and the kids
[1:56:15] the children that are come from our
[1:56:16] little school they'll go on Monday
[1:56:19] morning and fact check by the Tom
[1:56:23] gives me a
[1:56:25] complex
[1:56:30] taper you'll get it one
[1:56:33] day Revelation 101 a mighty Angel has
[1:56:37] descended that we've lived in that and
[1:56:39] now we're looking past at that telling
[1:56:42] you that that is passed now because that
[1:56:45] happened we can preach what we're
[1:56:49] preach we're not looking for it to
[1:56:51] happen it's already happened amen we're
[1:56:54] speaking another
[1:56:56] language all right and he had in his
[1:56:59] hand a
[1:57:00] little open or
[1:57:03] closed it's open right so it's the open
[1:57:06] book it's not a closed book we should be
[1:57:09] able to Rejoice What I Hear on last last
[1:57:12] Sunday you should be dancing around this
[1:57:15] place I saw my name it's opened up it's
[1:57:18] a revelation I'm going to be changed in
[1:57:21] a in the twinkling of an eyee let me
[1:57:25] show you a mystery we shall not
[1:57:28] all but we shall be
[1:57:31] changed what day brother Tom this day
[1:57:35] I'm living in this day
[1:57:39] amen so in the
[1:57:41] breach brother BR starts with this
[1:57:44] question who was it he said the owner
[1:57:47] the original owner owner took the book
[1:57:50] of redemption in his right hand
[1:57:52] No Angel no Angelic being nothing else
[1:57:56] could take its place it was the bloody
[1:57:58] lamb that walked out and took the book
[1:58:01] out of his
[1:58:02] hand so people look at that well what
[1:58:05] takes place go God can do anything he
[1:58:07] wants to do God can change form can
[1:58:10] change veils can change theophanies can
[1:58:13] change and people try to understand how
[1:58:16] could be on the throne and take the book
[1:58:18] from the
[1:58:19] throne oh my I am not not confused at
[1:58:23] all I hope you're not God's doing this
[1:58:27] it's all God and not man it's all God
[1:58:31] what is it brother this is the most now
[1:58:35] listen to me this is the most Sublime
[1:58:38] thing in the
[1:58:45] scripture you know when the seals were
[1:58:47] being
[1:58:48] broken and the Bible says all Heaven
[1:58:51] heard John Rejoice because there was one
[1:58:53] worthy to take the book right yeah all
[1:58:57] Heaven rejoice and all under heaven and
[1:59:00] all in heaven all around her and rejoice
[1:59:02] and when the seals were being open in
[1:59:05] Jeffersonville yeah it's about as quiet
[1:59:07] as it is right
[1:59:09] now but John was
[1:59:12] rejoicing
[1:59:14] Hallelujah there was one worthy to take
[1:59:17] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:59:21] it will never be amen it will always be
[1:59:25] God that's
[1:59:28] right
[1:59:29] [Music]
[1:59:31] Hallelujah Jesus answered them saying
[1:59:33] the hour has come the son of man should
[1:59:36] be glorified you're at the end of an age
[1:59:39] in the first seal his ministry is ending
[1:59:42] see The Hours come when the son of man
[1:59:46] should be glorified what about it the
[1:59:49] hour has come when the bride shall be
[1:59:53] taken
[1:59:54] away and I heard
[1:59:57] a there a time now we're living in the
[2:00:00] time don't look for another time look
[2:00:03] for this time it's happening all around
[2:00:06] us look at America look what's coming
[2:00:08] into your political system see the
[2:00:10] shaking that's going on she's going to
[2:00:12] go
[2:00:13] bankrupt and I heard an amen around the
[2:00:16] whole
[2:00:17] place your nation's going to be bankrupt
[2:00:20] we're going to be bankrupt
[2:00:22] but Rome has to come in you say they're
[2:00:25] giving money away they're giving this
[2:00:26] away they have to to bankrupt the system
[2:00:31] so Rome can come
[2:00:34] in and take it
[2:00:36] back with Wall Street Jews but here's
[2:00:40] the best part of the story it's not a
[2:00:42] story when that pack takes place the
[2:00:45] bride's
[2:00:49] gone oh we're going to have nothing
[2:00:52] that's right we came in the world with
[2:00:54] nothing we're leaving with
[2:01:02] nothing
[2:01:04] hallelujah praise the lord it's
[2:01:07] happening and if I was a young person
[2:01:09] that wasn't saved filled with the Holy
[2:01:12] Ghost I'd get a little serious tonight
[2:01:14] I'd say brother Tom I need
[2:01:19] salvation Dilly ding wai waiting
[2:01:27] pausing the Rapture is upon us this
[2:01:30] stage is set to
[2:01:32] go I'm not saying that to make it a
[2:01:35] fearful thing but it is a fearful
[2:01:40] thing
[2:01:42] amen God spoke from his eternal Throne
[2:01:45] the prophet said to say that the seal
[2:01:48] was to be revealed and when it was
[2:01:50] placed before John it was in symbol then
[2:01:53] John saw it it became a mystery why it
[2:01:56] wasn't even revealed then it cannot be
[2:01:59] revealed until what he said at the end
[2:02:02] time but it come in a symbol but you
[2:02:06] know that God made a prophet on Sunset
[2:02:09] mountain and say go back to
[2:02:12] Jeffersonville and I'll meet you there
[2:02:16] he said I would have made a terrible
[2:02:17] mistake this morning I was looking at uh
[2:02:21] what whatever books he was looking at
[2:02:24] and he said but I would have made a
[2:02:26] terrible mistake but then he
[2:02:28] came amen so it wasn't a man that opened
[2:02:31] and revealed the book it was God that
[2:02:34] opened and revealed the
[2:02:36] book and it's not complicated cuz he
[2:02:39] preached before the seals God hidden and
[2:02:42] revealed in Simplicity after the seals
[2:02:44] God hidden and revealed in Simplicity
[2:02:46] say it's all too complex to me no it's
[2:02:49] your lifeline
[2:02:52] amen amen
[2:02:58] hallelujah now is my soul troubled Jesus
[2:03:01] said in John

[2:03:38] day father glorify your
[2:03:42] son next verse that thy
[2:03:45] son might glorify

[2:03:58] Christ who is our life shall appear we
[2:04:01] shall also appear with him in glory
[2:04:03] which is God's thought and for God to
[2:04:06] reveal his glory to you in the Greek
[2:04:09] means you're worth
[2:04:13] it there's no way he's going to reveal
[2:04:15] his glory to somebody that's not worth
[2:04:18] it but if you look up in the Greek if
[2:04:21] God's going to show you his glory he's
[2:04:23] telling you personally you are worth
[2:04:27] [Applause]
[2:04:31] it Hallelujah when Christ who our life
[2:04:34] shall appear thanu be manifested then we

[2:11:54] time I'm two hours
[2:11:59] behind love
[2:12:02] it I'm sure happy I'm not one of those
[2:12:05] church goers that
[2:12:09] goes and I learned a lesson a long time
[2:12:12] ago I never say give me five more
[2:12:14] minutes because the kids will challenge
[2:12:17] you on that they'll put their stopwatch
[2:12:20] on huh he said five he's taking
[2:12:26] 15 so give me some
[2:12:28] [Applause]
[2:12:30] time open-ended
[2:12:33] right John the Baptist was Malachi 3
[2:12:36] that's right Matthew 11 says so if you
[2:12:39] can receive it this is he who spoke of
[2:12:42] behold I sent my messenger before my
[2:12:44] face it was Elijah certainly Jesus said
[2:12:47] it was but not the Elijah all right of
[2:12:50] Malachi four it's very very
[2:12:53] clear very clear he said now in my
[2:12:57] commission I am just your
[2:13:01] brother are you listening I am just your
[2:13:04] brother by the grace of God but when the
[2:13:06] angel of the Lord moves
[2:13:10] down it becomes then the voice of God to
[2:13:16] you amen hallelujah so you don't put on
[2:13:19] a tape for background
[2:13:22] it's the voice of God to you come
[2:13:27] on it's the voice of God to you when he
[2:13:30] comes down I'm just your brother but
[2:13:33] when he comes down I'm the voice of God
[2:13:35] to you so next time you pick up the tape
[2:13:38] you just say before you listen to a tape
[2:13:40] tape what is it
[2:13:42] now
[2:13:44] computer when you click the computer on
[2:13:48] yeah say just a second that's God's
[2:13:52] thought coming through this
[2:13:54] channel yes sir and that's God's word
[2:13:57] speaking to
[2:13:59] me it's amazing how people so casually
[2:14:03] just discard it they come to the message
[2:14:07] five six years walk away they had no
[2:14:10] Revelation all they enjoyed was
[2:14:13] Fellowship I'm sorry I might get in
[2:14:16] trouble here huh they just come to a
[2:14:19] church because it's nice because you
[2:14:21] sisters are lovely and the brothers are
[2:14:23] so kind and they enjoy that kind of
[2:14:25] Fellowship only for so
[2:14:27] long and then all a
[2:14:29] suddening they're gone because they've
[2:14:32] never been
[2:14:33] revelated because the gates of hell can
[2:14:35] never Prevail against the
[2:14:38] Revelation you become a prisoner of love
[2:14:40] to Jesus
[2:14:42] Christ do you understand that it's very
[2:14:45] simple he said but when the angel of the
[2:14:48] Lord moves
[2:14:49] down it becomes then a voice of God to
[2:14:52] you maybe it offended you for me saying
[2:14:56] that forgive me I felt that that might
[2:15:00] have been
[2:15:01] resented but I am the voice of God to
[2:15:08] you hallelujah what that same voice that
[2:15:12] came from that other realm coming into
[2:15:14] this realm to pull us into that
[2:15:18] realm that's right it didn't just for us
[2:15:21] to quote brother
[2:15:22] brandham it's for that word to stimulate
[2:15:25] us say I'm going home I'm going to take
[2:15:29] a
[2:15:30] change not because brother Tom said so
[2:15:33] or any Minister says so it's because the
[2:15:36] word of God said so it's the voice of
[2:15:39] God to you maybe if I've offended you I
[2:15:44] forgive me but I felt that might be
[2:15:48] resented but I am God's voice to you
[2:15:51] and I say that again that time under
[2:15:55] inspiration you see I felt bad about it
[2:15:58] the first time but I repeated
[2:16:03] it amen that's sometimes why we
[2:16:06] repeat he said he said that five minutes
[2:16:09] ago well we'll say it
[2:16:11] again repeated it now I can say nothing
[2:16:14] in myself but what he shows me you
[2:16:17] believe
[2:16:18] it that was not my my
[2:16:22] voice I heard that voice from the
[2:16:25] excellent Glory coming to this dimension
[2:16:29] for a purpose not just to be heard but
[2:16:32] to pull us back to where we came
[2:16:35] from so he said that was not my voice
[2:16:38] that was him now nothing could be hid
[2:16:40] from him whatever that voice was
[2:16:43] speaking just a few minutes ago it
[2:16:45] wasn't your brother it was Jesus Christ
[2:16:49] using my
[2:16:51] voice are you are you hearing
[2:16:53] me all right now you are suffering with
[2:16:58] a nervous condition you're extremely
[2:17:00] nervous person then you're pending an
[2:17:03] operation it's a large tumor located in
[2:17:06] your stomach inwardly those things are
[2:17:08] true that was not my
[2:17:12] voice that was
[2:17:15] him so oh brother Tom we've heard that
[2:17:18] before hear it again
[2:17:23] do you know now believe the voice that's
[2:17:27] speaking then was not my voice it was my
[2:17:31] voice but it wasn't me operating my
[2:17:36] voice I do not know what's wrong with
[2:17:39] the woman whatever he said is on the
[2:17:42] tape down here and you can read it
[2:17:46] tomorrow whatever he said is true
[2:17:51] true and that's the
[2:17:56] truth a voice came and said as John the
[2:18:00] Baptist forrun the first coming your
[2:18:02] message will for forrun the second
[2:18:04] coming when they stood there and
[2:18:06] witnessed the Morning Star coming down
[2:18:08] out of Heaven circling like that and
[2:18:11] said as John the Baptist was sent to
[2:18:14] forerun the first coming here that
[2:18:16] Pillar of Fire came whirling out of the
[2:18:19] air coming down where I was standing and
[2:18:22] the voice
[2:18:24] said as John the Baptist
[2:18:28] foran the hour has come when your
[2:18:32] message will spray the
[2:18:35] world I love that because brother Bram
[2:18:38] uses that spray in another another quote
[2:18:41] where he said the blood of Christ
[2:18:43] sprayed the
[2:18:46] world it has gone around and around the
[2:18:50] world that's right we have a we all have
[2:18:53] enjoyed the message Hub brother bisc had
[2:18:55] a a great burden and vision to put a
[2:18:58] message Hub and brother Darren has been
[2:19:00] very one of the most ingal integral
[2:19:03] parts of of creating that Vision to
[2:19:08] materialize and what is it brother
[2:19:10] Darren right now how many countries have
[2:19:11] not

[2:19:23] count sorry seed of Satan I
[2:19:28] mean North

[2:19:33] gone around the world under the Great
[2:19:35] Commission go therefore in all the world
[2:19:39] and preach the
[2:19:41] gospel but it couldn't the Great
[2:19:43] Commission couldn't be sent until the
[2:19:46] seals were
[2:19:48] open and it's amazing that it's going
[2:19:51] around and around and around the world
[2:19:53] we don't want to miss what God's doing
[2:19:55] right now you've been wonderful pulling
[2:19:58] and very attentive but I just want to
[2:20:01] prepare to close now don't miss
[2:20:05] it whatever you do don't miss it it's
[2:20:09] happening and I I and I felt
[2:20:12] that coming here tonight when your
[2:20:14] pastor was speaking on these things and
[2:20:16] I'm thinking how perfect brother Tim how
[2:20:20] perfect
[2:20:21] the subject and what was spoken was
[2:20:23] coming together and just giving me a
[2:20:26] little bit of a charge that you're in
[2:20:28] the right channel preach it it's
[2:20:31] happening we see it happening I want you
[2:20:34] pinch yourself pinch yourself Lord
[2:20:37] awaken me to the reality of what's
[2:20:40] happening when you get in your car young
[2:20:43] man don't talk about what you got big
[2:20:45] how many hamburgers you can eat or what
[2:20:46] milkshake you're going to have you might
[2:20:48] have banana I know some people put an
[2:20:50] order in
[2:20:54] already but let's put our order in the
[2:20:57] word we got we got some meetings to to
[2:21:00] to preach and to let the Holy Spirit
[2:21:02] deal with
[2:21:06] us and I'm believing that you can take
[2:21:10] the word even right now and you can be a
[2:21:13] different person than when you came into
[2:21:14] this room I believe that with all my
[2:21:17] heart I believe it with all my heart but
[2:21:19] let it be according to you to you
[2:21:22] according to his word but then you've
[2:21:25] got to say Let It Be unto me Let It Be
[2:21:28] unto me according to your word Lord be a
[2:21:32] Mary be a
[2:21:36] Mary I am the Lord God that raised up
[2:21:38] Christ from the dead amazing quote
[2:21:41] unseen looking to the Unseen amazing
[2:21:43] quote Brothers have preached on it over
[2:21:45] the years tremendous quote I love this
[2:21:48] quote here brother Brandon and said
[2:21:50] don't don't you feel that pulsation of
[2:21:52] Faith don't you just feel that and I'm
[2:21:54] feeling it right now I don't you feel
[2:21:56] that pulsation of Faith but just lift up
[2:21:58] your hands he said just lift up your
[2:22:00] hands if you want to come to the front
[2:22:02] you come to the front he said just lift
[2:22:04] up your hands let's just worship Him and
[2:22:07] the Holy Spirit comes down I am the Lord
[2:22:09] God that raised Christ from the dead
[2:22:11] amen I'm the one that sent the Holy
[2:22:14] Ghost I'm the one that give you the
[2:22:16] promise brother Brenham has nothing to
[2:22:18] do with this I have S he has surrendered
[2:22:21] his life to me and I'm using his spirit
[2:22:26] and I'm talking through his lips that's
[2:22:28] me I am the
[2:22:31] Lord we should Rejoice this is not a
[2:22:35] message of man this is the message of
[2:22:37] almighty
[2:22:40] God and I Heard a Voice from his
[2:22:43] excellent
[2:22:46] Glory this is my beloved bride
[2:22:50] hear ye
[2:22:54] her come
[2:22:58] on not a nice quote but a reality it's a
[2:23:02] lovely reality it's
[2:23:07] lovely the church brother Bram said
[2:23:10] here's the the quote that you you know
[2:23:13] so well out the latest see in church age
[2:23:15] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[2:23:17] of God it's its own mouthpiece God's
[2:23:21] turning on her he will confound her
[2:23:23] through the prophet and the
[2:23:27] bride he never left you out he never
[2:23:31] left you out I come from him I go back
[2:23:34] to him right amen now listen I will
[2:23:38] confound her through the prophet and the
[2:23:40] bride for the voice of God will be in
[2:23:45] her so now let me ask a
[2:23:48] question is it the brothers that are
[2:23:51] speaking or is it God speaking I know
[2:23:55] that gets to be a hard gospel to swallow
[2:23:58] cuz you're looking at my
[2:24:00] veil but you have to pierce with eyes of
[2:24:05] understanding to go past the veil and
[2:24:08] hear the word of
[2:24:10] God that's what you got to do you got to
[2:24:13] do it
[2:24:15] Saints you have to do it he will
[2:24:18] confound her it's another language
[2:24:21] you're speaking from another realm God's
[2:24:23] speaking to you in that realm and you're
[2:24:25] speaking back that word into that realm
[2:24:27] and you can say I feel the pull brother
[2:24:29] Tom I'm being drawn to his
[2:24:33] bosom we're winding up in this great
[2:24:38] hour Brother David this is for you as we
[2:24:41] came down from
[2:24:42] Switzerland we're coming off the
[2:24:45] mountain we're coming down coming down
[2:24:49] and as we come down around the mountain
[2:24:51] we come down and there is a horizontal
[2:24:54] rainbow not an arch
[2:24:56] rainbow a straight
[2:24:59] rainbow brother Bram said there's
[2:25:01] something great laying ahead of us right
[2:25:03] now the years have been the joy that
[2:25:06] we've looked forward to the pressing the
[2:25:09] coming of that great light and now we
[2:25:12] can see the breaking over that
[2:25:15] horizontal realm is breaking between
[2:25:19] Mortal and and
[2:25:21] immortality we can see it breaking
[2:25:24] Between Heaven and Earth from an
[2:25:26] Earthbound sickness and troubled world
[2:25:29] into a bright shining day of immortal
