TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'm removing all of the things that could move me further from you. I think you could not be enough. It's not lost on me what you saved me from. I'm running stumbling I know but I'm coming to give you this offering my worship or never withhold. broken, but you call it beautiful. [Music] Where the tears of the desperate [Music] reach the feet of the Savior, nothing I wouldn't offer. There's no waste at the altar where the heart of surrender meets the hands of the maker. [Music] Nothing I wouldn't offer. There's no waste at the altar. [Music] Things I've treed couldn't come close to your presence. Grace upon grace, who could measure? No, nothing could measure. I'm returning back to the one I am wanting to give him my love. He took a sinner like me. Wash me with grace and then set me free. [Music] May the tears of the desperate reach the feet of the Savior. Nothing I wouldn't offer. There's no way at the altar where the heart of surrender meets the hands of the maker. Nothing I wouldn't offer. There's no way at the altar. [Music] Come lay your broken dreams at the altar. And every victory at the altar. Fear and anxiety cannot live here. There's no waste at the altar. Let your heart sing out. Tell him you love him. Don't make it perfect. Let it be honest. He can use anything. Sit back and watch him. There's no waste at the altar. Come lay your broken dreams at the altar. And every victory at the altar. Fear and anxiety cannot live here. No waste at the altar. Let your heart sing out and tell him you love it. Don't make it perfect. Just let it be hest. He can use anything. Sit back and watch him. There's no waste at the altar. There's no waste at the altar. There's no waste at the altar. There's no waste at the altar. [Music] Come lay your broken dreams at the altar. And every victory at the altar. Fear and anxiety cannot live here. There's no waste at the altar. Let your heart sing out and tell him you love him. Don't make it perfect. Just let it be honest. He can use anything. Sit back and watch. There's no waste at the altar. There's no waste at the altar. No waste at the altar. [Applause]
