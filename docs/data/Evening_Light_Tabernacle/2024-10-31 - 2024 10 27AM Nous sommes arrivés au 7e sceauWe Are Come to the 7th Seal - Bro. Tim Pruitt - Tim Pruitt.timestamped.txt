[24:46] people to enjoy the great things of God
[24:51] who you are I you know you may never
[24:53] heard of
[24:54] me and it's not even important you know
[24:57] who I am
[24:59] but if I can get you to get in love with
[25:01] Jes that's what's really
[25:05] important and I pray that when you leave
[25:07] from
[25:08] here from these meetings you'll be just
[25:11] a little closer to the
[25:13] Lord just see a little more of
[25:16] him we want to get a glimpse of what
[25:18] he's doing in this
[25:20] day when we speak about things no don't
[25:24] sit down and say oh I'll never get this
[25:26] I'll never understand
[25:29] but when we speak about the things of
[25:31] God just realize it's given to
[25:35] you the
[25:37] Mysteries amen it's given to you to know
[25:41] and if God said it it's important so we
[25:45] want to take and listen and see what God
[25:47] has said to us in our
[25:51] generation if you'll turn with me to
[25:53] Revelation 5 and verse
[25:58] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[26:00] the throne a book written within and on
[26:02] the backside sealed with Seven
[26:09] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[26:12] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[26:14] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[26:16] seals
[26:22] thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in
[26:25] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[26:27] to open the book neither to look there
[26:33] on and I wept much because no man was
[26:37] found worthy to open and to read the
[26:39] book neither to look their
[26:44] on and one of the elders said to me weep
[26:47] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[26:49] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[26:51] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[26:54] Seals thereof
[27:02] and I beheld and low in the midst of the
[27:04] throne and of the four beast and in the
[27:06] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[27:09] had been slain and having seven horns
[27:11] and seven eyes which are the seven
[27:14] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[27:26] Earth and he came and took took the book
[27:29] out of the right hand of him that sat on
[27:31] the
[27:34] throne and when he had taken the book
[27:36] The Four Beast and the 4 and20 Elders
[27:39] fell down before the lamb having every
[27:41] one of them Harps and golden vials full
[27:44] of odors which are the prayers of the
[27:54] Saints amen and they sung a new song
[28:00] think of this it brought him to a new
[28:02] level of
[28:04] worship and they sung a new song saying
[28:07] Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to
[28:10] open the seals thereof for thou was
[28:12] slain and has redeemed us to God by that
[28:15] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[28:17] and people and Nation
[28:30] amen and has made us under our God Kings
[28:33] and Priests and we shall reign on the
[28:40] earth and I beheld and I heard the voice
[28:43] of many angels round about the throne
[28:46] and the Beast and the elders and the
[28:48] numbers of them was 10,000 times 10,000
[28:52] and thousands of thousands
[29:02] amen saying with a loud voice Worthy is
[29:05] the Lamb that was slain to receive power
[29:08] and riches and wisdom and strength and
[29:10] honor and glory and
[29:19] blessings and every creature which is in
[29:22] heaven and on the earth and under the
[29:24] Earth and such as are in the he and all
[29:29] that are in them heard I saying blessing
[29:32] and honor and glory and power be unto
[29:35] him that sth upon the throne and to the
[29:38] lamb forever and
[29:50] ever and the four Beast said amen and
[29:53] the 4 and 20 Elders fell down and
[29:55] worshiped him that liveth forever ever
[29:58] and
[30:02] ever amen amen God bless you
[30:08] cand we've read in the scripture this
[30:13] morning of of something that is
[30:16] happening in the
[30:19] heaven and it's not a moment twinkling
[30:22] of an ey
[30:25] event but it is a
[30:28] process of
[30:31] redemption and that begins with the
[30:35] lamb and taking the book of
[30:39] redemption and it finishes up with all
[30:42] creation worshiping
[30:46] God and as we look at this
[30:49] today I think of where we are in
[30:52] time I want to be among those that
[30:54] defeat
[30:56] death we had our forefathers our first
[30:59] parents that walked out of
[31:02] Eden but I want to be a part of
[31:05] those that walk back into Eden on I want
[31:09] to be those that are one of those that
[31:11] are counted worthy to overcome death
[31:13] hell and the
[31:15] grave our overcome Hell In The
[31:19] Grave you know I can think of no higher
[31:22] honor to be one of the Bride
[31:25] members who can bring total defeat to
[31:28] Satan's
[31:30] kingdom and in order to do that he will
[31:34] take an abundance of rapturing
[31:37] Grace and that rapturing Grace producing
[31:41] the faith for this
[31:43] hour now I'm going to look in the book
[31:46] of Hebrews 12 verse
[31:50] 18 where Paul is telling his church
[31:54] where they had come to
[31:59] so he starts in verse 18 saying for you
[32:02] are not come into the mount that might
[32:04] be touched and that burned with fire nor
[32:07] Blackness or into Blackness and darkness
[32:10] and
[32:16] Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and
[32:19] the voice of Words which voice they
[32:21] heard in treated that the word should
[32:24] not be spoken to them anymore
[32:31] so he said you haven't come there but
[32:34] here's where you come you have come to
[32:37] Mount
[32:38] Zion to the city of the Living God to
[32:42] the Heavenly
[32:43] Jerusalem to innumerable company of
[32:47] angels to the general
[32:50] assembly the Church of the firstborn
[32:53] which are written in heaven and to God
[32:57] the judge of all
[32:59] and to the spirits of justment
[33:02] made now Paul was dealing with the
[33:04] people in his
[33:06] age to try to get them to see where they
[33:09] were in
[33:12] time for what was what was happening in
[33:15] their
[33:16] hour you know this was really important
[33:19] that he gets them on
[33:22] board and so because there's a great
[33:25] blinding that was going on in that age
[33:29] the gospel was turning from the Jews to
[33:32] the
[33:33] Gentiles and this right here was
[33:36] addressed to the
[33:38] Hebrews the Hebrews or the Jews were
[33:42] having difficulty seeing what God was
[33:44] doing in their
[33:46] hour because there was a tremendous
[33:49] blinding that was going on in their
[33:53] time this blinding was so
[33:56] great that they even crucified their
[34:00] Messiah that's how blind they were and
[34:03] the Bible said if they had
[34:06] known they would not have crucified the
[34:08] Lord Of
[34:09] Glory but some of them got so caught up
[34:12] in this
[34:15] blinding that according to Paul they
[34:17] would have not done this at
[34:19] all but because of the blinding that was
[34:22] going on in this their
[34:24] age it went from there into Great
[34:31] Tribulation 2,000 years where the Jews
[34:35] have been a persecuted
[34:38] people because of their rejection of the
[34:42] Messiah as Jesus said in Matthew
[34:47] 24:21 then shall there be Great
[34:50] Tribulation such as what was not since
[34:53] the beginning of the world in this
[34:55] time nor shall there ever
[34:59] be and so for 2,000
[35:02] years the Jews have been in Great
[35:07] Tribulation dispersed among the
[35:09] Nations A persecuted
[35:12] people because they missed their
[35:16] day and the same things will happen to
[35:19] the
[35:20] Gentiles because there are many who have
[35:23] their names in The Book of
[35:25] Life that had they know
[35:28] it they would not have crucified the
[35:31] word they would not reject the
[35:35] word them but because of this they will
[35:39] find themselves in the Great
[35:41] Tribulation for further
[35:43] purging even as the Jewish
[35:46] did now so it's important that we know
[35:50] what where we have come
[35:54] to now I'm going to speak this morning
[35:58] and we have come to the seventh
[36:02] seal because it is the ending of all
[36:07] things it is the ending of time and the
[36:10] blending of
[36:12] Eternity there are many things that are
[36:15] happening in this day that we must be
[36:19] aware
[36:20] of otherwise we will reject the
[36:24] Messiah and we will miss what God is
[36:27] doing
[36:28] now remember even Disciples of
[36:32] Elijah I'm talking about John the
[36:34] Baptist missed the
[36:36] Messiah missed the
[36:39] coming and they kept following you know
[36:42] even what John had said without seeing
[36:46] what
[36:48] he and it is important for us to see
[36:52] what the message has pointed us
[36:56] to so Paul is trying to get the people
[36:59] to see in his day where they had
[37:02] come and the Ephesian age was one that
[37:06] aimed at the High
[37:08] Calling and then they
[37:10] relaxed they never achieved what was
[37:13] laying before them because they
[37:16] relaxed it was a time that Paul was
[37:19] already
[37:21] speaking and Mysteries were being
[37:24] revealed he says I'm going to show you a
[37:27] mystery
[37:29] we shall not all
[37:30] sleep he was already beginning to speak
[37:33] to
[37:34] them for we which are alive and remain
[37:38] we will not hinder those that are asleep
[37:41] he was starting to give them the
[37:43] revelation of the
[37:46] Rapture Paul was telling them we have
[37:50] arrived at a place and it's a wonderful
[37:53] place I'm going to show you a mystery of
[37:56] what is going to happen
[37:58] what lies right here within our
[38:01] grass right before us but instead of
[38:04] grasping
[38:06] it it wasn't long until the first church
[38:10] aged was something against them he said
[38:13] you have lost your first
[38:15] love and I've got someone against you
[38:19] the first church had already began to
[38:23] fall already they had divisions among
[38:26] them
[38:27] and they had got their eyes on
[38:30] men saying I'm of Paul and I'm of
[38:34] Apollos and they thought this was
[38:37] spiritual but Paul said it's caral and
[38:40] said you walk as men said it's Christ
[38:44] divided and of course this divided
[38:46] chrisan into 40,000
[38:50] denominations we in the message have not
[38:52] been immune to
[38:54] this we have splintered into many groups
[38:58] we quickly just Fellowship those don't
[39:01] see
[39:03] exactly amen now let me tell you if you
[39:08] think you're way on the top of the
[39:10] ladder and I'm down
[39:12] here I'm coming behind
[39:16] you don't kick me in the
[39:19] face I want to ask you how did you get
[39:22] up
[39:23] here it was Grace that got you what does
[39:27] you was more
[39:28] intelligent more spiritual it was Grace
[39:32] that lifted you there so if Grace
[39:35] put
[39:37] have for others who are coming behind
[39:41] you amen
[39:44] amen so it's not my goal at
[39:46] all to get you to fall in love with
[39:49] me I want you to fall in love
[39:53] Jes now here's a principle in God's word
[39:57] when God gives a
[39:59] word that word cannot return unto him
[40:03] boy let's go back to the first in
[40:07] Eden he see even though Eva's given a
[40:11] word be fruitful and multiply replenish
[40:15] the
[40:16] Earth but she didn't do it as God
[40:18] said she did it the way the
[40:22] serpent amen and they
[40:25] multiplied but not like God said
[40:28] but God's word could not return to
[40:31] him there had to be somebody still born
[40:34] of the spoken
[40:36] word there was a virgin who would
[40:40] conceive by the spoken word bring forth
[40:43] the son and that would be Christ and
[40:46] from him would come a whole new
[40:49] race men and women Bor
[40:53] God hallelujah amen that's what the new
[40:55] birth is about it is to give us the
[40:58] birth that we should have had before the
[41:02] fall you see the word couldn't return to
[41:05] inv
[41:05] void so that word would lay
[41:09] dormant until finally the seed came the
[41:13] one that would bruise the head of the
[41:15] serpent and correct what he did so that
[41:19] we can have the right
[41:21] birth the reason we have to be born
[41:23] again again is because we had the wrong
[41:26] birth but when you're born again you're
[41:29] born again of Incorruptible SE of the
[41:33] word of God that lives and abide
[41:36] forever so when the word is given like
[41:40] in the in the time of Moses you know
[41:44] Israel came to their
[41:46] Kadesh and because they wouldn't go into
[41:49] the
[41:50] land that did not make the word of God
[41:53] void somebody was going to go in that
[41:55] land
[41:57] that
[41:59] generation but there was a people who
[42:02] did they were given this opportunity to
[42:05] go
[42:06] in now we in this age are having
[42:10] difficulty seeing the
[42:12] truth you see Leia is prophesied to be
[42:18] blind and it's going to take the of the
[42:21] word of
[42:22] God you're going to totally Miss what
[42:24] God
[42:25] is and you a word
[42:29] rejector and it's the word is the only
[42:31] thing that can save
[42:33] you when you reject the word there's
[42:36] only one thing left for and that is to
[42:39] go to
[42:40] tribulation more purging and we don't
[42:43] want to go to the
[42:45] tribulation amen that's not my goal for
[42:48] you or for me myself I don't want to be
[42:52] in the tribulation I want to go in the
[42:54] rapure I want to be a part of that
[42:58] amen yeah it's a foolish thing to go
[43:01] into the
[43:02] tribulation foolish virgins will be
[43:05] there amen but there's a wise who will
[43:09] be whose eyes will be open to the
[43:12] truth there is a word that
[43:16] promises that there will be those alive
[43:19] and remain the coming of the
[43:22] Lord I want to be among
[43:24] that and I don't want to miss what God
[43:26] is
[43:28] so I just say oh God you sent eyes in
[43:32] this
[43:33] day don't let luk
[43:36] Warmness don't let
[43:38] Le blind me so I can't see the pride
[43:43] lays before
[43:45] me all my hopes and
[43:47] dreams
[43:49] nothing the glory that be reveal us it's
[43:54] very important that we St
[43:57] what God is
[43:59] doing what is really
[44:03] important the Ephesian
[44:05] AG that we have read about they relaxed
[44:09] drifted they never
[44:11] achieved but this word cannot return
[44:15] to so there has to be a people brought
[44:18] back to the same
[44:20] place come back again exactly where the
[44:23] Fe church
[44:25] was and this time
[44:27] enter into the full
[44:30] promise friends we cannot perpetuate the
[44:35] ages we're at the end of the
[44:38] ages there are no more ages to come we
[44:42] are
[44:43] through and God will not
[44:46] fail somebody's going to fulfill that
[44:49] word somebody's going to believe it
[44:53] somebody's going to be standing there
[44:55] and changed
[45:00] say be somebody that to give the word
[45:04] preeminence say it might as well be
[45:07] me amen that ought to be in your heart
[45:10] today to be me amen I'm not going to let
[45:15] anything between me and
[45:18] that nothing that Satan has with all he
[45:23] has to offer in this scientific
[45:26] achievement
[45:28] nothing can be
[45:29] compared the glory that shall be
[45:33] revealed amen
[45:35] am Paul was speaking of these
[45:38] things of how there were better
[45:41] things in the New Covenant what was in
[45:45] the
[45:45] old now we're standing back here
[45:48] today those bunch of dummies back
[45:51] there how come they didn't know this
[45:55] was it should be obvious
[45:58] Jesus the lamb was better than the wly
[46:00] animal
[46:02] lamb you know we look back and we see
[46:05] this is obvious to us but he is dealing
[46:09] with the people who are going
[46:13] blind amen amen so he writes a whole
[46:17] book to the
[46:19] Hebrews to tell them we got something
[46:24] better amen now you know we have
[46:28] something amen we know sorry we know
[46:33] that the New Covenant is better than the
[46:36] old amen so he would go through the book
[46:39] of
[46:40] Hebrews and he said it's been made so
[46:42] much better than the
[46:44] angels we got a better
[46:47] Revelation it's a more excellent name so
[46:50] it's a better name see the whole theme
[46:54] to The Book of Hebrews is we have more
[46:57] we have something greater we have
[46:59] something better these are key words in
[47:02] the of
[47:04] Hebrews amen again and again he is
[47:08] saying it's better it's greater what we
[47:11] have is
[47:13] greater well it should be obvious that
[47:16] the new C Covenant is better than the
[47:18] old
[47:20] Covenant us today we're looking back and
[47:23] it's without question but I want you to
[47:26] understand
[47:28] as we are criticizing
[47:29] them we are also having
[47:33] difficulty understanding what is better
[47:36] what is more what is greater because of
[47:40] the blindness of the
[47:42] age because Le oia is
[47:46] prophesied to be blind the Gentiles will
[47:50] be blind like
[47:53] thews so in this
[47:55] day I
[47:57] usion to keep people from seeing what is
[48:04] important
[48:06] amen and it's going to take a continual
[48:09] washing by the water of the
[48:12] word
[48:15] with so that you will count other things
[48:19] so so that or else you will count other
[48:22] things greater importance than his
[48:25] word so it's going to take a continual
[48:31] washing Leia has to have this Zeal to
[48:39] repent say well I've T this for
[48:42] years you have to be willing to
[48:45] repent no matter
[48:47] what amen you see what see what the word
[48:50] says you might have held on this and
[48:53] thought it was right but you have to
[48:55] come to the point
[48:57] where you can
[48:58] repent the Zeal of the
[49:01] hour Lord whatever I want to be
[49:06] right search it
[49:08] daily be willing to be corrected
[49:11] by amen amen that's my motto for my
[49:16] life whatever God I Want to Be
[49:19] Right
[49:22] amen now in the book of
[49:25] Hebrews he said we are persuaded of
[49:28] better
[49:30] things so there's a better
[49:32] end he spoke of the of a better
[49:36] priesthood he speaks of a better hope of
[49:40] a better Covenant of a better
[49:43] mediator a better
[49:45] priesthood better promises better
[49:49] sacrifices you see a better future a
[49:52] better country a better
[49:55] Resurrection see a better blood he's
[49:59] trying to get them to
[50:01] understand this is a better blood it's a
[50:04] more powerful
[50:05] blood it is a superior
[50:09] priesthood Jesus was Superior to
[50:12] Moses he was Superior King than
[50:16] David everything is greater better
[50:21] more amen trying to do his best to get
[50:24] them to see
[50:26] the Fe and age was brought to their
[50:29] Cades
[50:30] bar of entering into the land they
[50:34] looked at it they aimed at the High
[50:37] Calling and relaxed they didn't enter
[50:41] Israel did the same thing they came up
[50:44] and they looked into it tasted of it and
[50:48] went back into
[50:50] wandering and for Seven
[50:52] Ages we have been wandering around and
[50:57] around wild we'll Camp here we call that
[51:02] Lutheran we call Camp here we call that
[51:06] method and we camp
[51:08] here and we call that
[51:11] Aus you see we we all of these camps of
[51:15] where we come through the
[51:17] Wilderness but that's not the
[51:20] Homeland
[51:23] am and for Seven Ages we have went into
[51:28] wandering but we have come back to the
[51:31] very
[51:32] spot where it is our time to cross the
[51:37] Jordan to enter into the full
[51:41] inheritance we have come back to where
[51:43] Adam and Eve
[51:45] was where the tree of life stands before
[51:49] us and the tree of knowledge stands
[51:52] before and it has reached its height it
[51:55] has come to his glory
[51:57] and we're making a choice today of which
[52:01] tree we're going to partake
[52:04] us will we take life or will we take
[52:08] knowledge
[52:12] amen so brother Bram tells us in a
[52:15] message the
[52:16] Paradox we're promised according to
[52:19] Revelation
[52:20] 10 and according to
[52:23] Malachi that there has to come an
[52:26] Ephesians to
[52:28] this now remember he takes Ephesian and
[52:33] parallels it with
[52:35] Jos so as there was a book of
[52:40] Ephesians you know there was the Book of
[52:43] Joshua Joshua is where they entered into
[52:46] the
[52:47] land and Ephesian is where we are told
[52:52] that we enter in to all spiritual
[52:55] blessings
[52:57] in Heavenly places in Christ
[53:00] Jesus and so he said there must come an
[53:04] Ephesians that these Sevenfold Mysteries
[53:07] of the word of God
[53:10] must and it's in the
[53:15] Le I believe that we're
[53:17] there I believe we're right in the
[53:22] shadows and it's Joshua just before the
[53:25] Fe raised up
[53:27] so did John the Baptist raise up just
[53:29] before the
[53:31] next so you see it would be John the
[53:36] Baptist that would bring an Ephesian in
[53:38] that
[53:39] day into a new
[53:41] covenant by introducing the
[53:44] lamb that takes away the sin of the
[53:47] world amen amen now so as we look at
[53:51] this I I want to I want you to get
[53:54] something
[53:55] clear I'm not to
[53:57] Joshua I don't claim to be
[54:00] him I do claim to be a
[54:02] Caleb with
[54:04] Joshua and if you wonder who Joshua was
[54:08] there was only one man to whom the Bible
[54:11] came down with a hand turning the
[54:14] pages Joshua chapter
[54:17] one and then goes down to the verse 9
[54:21] verses with his finger and says as I was
[54:24] with Moses as I was through the
[54:27] Wilderness as I brought him down through
[54:32] Methodist all the way into Street and I
[54:36] was with them back there I will be with
[54:38] you I will not fail you you will inherit
[54:43] this
[54:44] land and you will divided for the
[54:49] people now remember under this Joshua
[54:52] commission he's got to take and show us
[54:55] what is the
[54:57] definition our
[55:00] land you see what is the
[55:03] Border amen so he says don't take Mount
[55:07] SE that belongs to
[55:09] es and don't take that over here to Moab
[55:14] that belongs to the children of lot I'm
[55:16] not going to give you what belongs to
[55:19] the
[55:21] 144 I'm not going to give you what
[55:24] belongs to the those with white Rob
[55:29] that's not your
[55:30] inheritance your inheritance is the land
[55:35] the whole word of God open book your
[55:40] inheritage is where the
[55:42] Messiah the resurrection will take where
[55:46] Rapture will take and youve got to be in
[55:51] that Amen to receive
[55:54] that to receive the
[55:56] Messiah we have come here to see the
[56:02] Messiah that's why we have returned not
[56:06] to build another
[56:07] organization not to put up new signs
[56:09] that say message
[56:11] church not to make followings of men we
[56:15] have come here to see the
[56:21] Messiah amen amen now you can't add
[56:25] nothing to the book
[56:27] or take nothing from it Revelation
[56:31] 228 whoever will take or add one word or
[56:34] take one word his part will takeen be
[56:37] taken out the book of life we cannot add
[56:39] or
[56:40] take so therefore we know that Luther
[56:43] could not get to W the reformers
[56:46] not on down they didn't get it all but
[56:50] what they had was gos
[56:52] truth but in the last days we are given
[56:57] understanding by the
[56:58] word that we are going to
[57:02] understand because it'll come an
[57:04] Ephesian age to
[57:07] it amen amen so we needed to
[57:11] Joshua to tell us what's in the land and
[57:15] what is our
[57:17] portion amen amen now you know it's kind
[57:21] of like this we got to know where we're
[57:24] at
[57:26] told this story before but Mary's
[57:28] telling it
[57:29] again you know I was on a trip with a
[57:33] brother you know and I I went and got my
[57:36] map and he said oh you don't need a map
[57:40] I know exactly where we're going I know
[57:42] all the roads and I you don't need a map
[57:46] I said you don't need a map I need a map
[57:50] you know where you're going I don't know
[57:54] where so about 2:00 in the
[57:57] morning I said can you drive an hour let
[58:01] me rest he be glad to I said now there's
[58:04] a turn down here you don't want to miss
[58:07] put I I know the way you can you can you
[58:11] know and so about an hour later I wake
[58:15] up and we have come to a stop sign and
[58:18] he said brother Tim the road is just
[58:23] disappeared I'm waking up and I said
[58:26] roads don't just
[58:29] disappear I said he said well yeah it
[58:33] just
[58:34] disappeared and I said get your mou and
[58:38] tell me where we are how to
[58:40] go I said it don't work that
[58:43] way I said you can't look at this mou
[58:47] and find out where we are you have to go
[58:50] in that store
[58:51] there and ask that man a question where
[58:56] am
[58:58] I and when you find where
[59:02] are then I can take the road
[59:05] map to take us where we're
[59:07] going but until I can find out where
[59:10] we're at on this
[59:11] map this map isn't no good to
[59:18] me and that's where we were in
[59:22] this we had a road map
[59:26] we didn't know where we were or are we
[59:28] in the first age even any age are we in
[59:32] the last age where are we and it took a
[59:37] prophet a SE to come and point to the
[59:42] SCP here you
[59:44] are so now we can take the
[59:48] r and take it all the way to
[59:52] the oh yeah amen amen
[59:58] so you see we had to have a
[1:00:00] messenger he said here you are you're at
[1:00:03] the last age you're at the very
[1:00:07] place that the first age was you went
[1:00:10] around cirle and you come back to where
[1:00:15] they left
[1:00:17] off and you're going to inherit the same
[1:00:20] thing they had so they were standing on
[1:00:24] the brink of the coming of the Lord
[1:00:27] they were standing on the border of the
[1:00:30] unfolding of the
[1:00:32] mystery we we have come to the end of
[1:00:35] the
[1:00:35] ages and we have come to the seventh
[1:00:40] seal and the seventh seal is end the end
[1:00:45] time because God kept the secret from
[1:00:47] other
[1:00:48] ages he reserved it until this
[1:00:52] time you know Paul was saying we were
[1:00:56] alive and
[1:00:57] remain but you see it was Kept Secret
[1:01:01] for seven Gentile
[1:01:03] ages but in in this day we heard a
[1:01:07] strong Angel began to Proclaim with a
[1:01:10] loud
[1:01:11] voice for someone
[1:01:14] Worthy is there someone worthy that can
[1:01:17] take the book and loose
[1:01:20] SE it's sealed up from us it's mystery
[1:01:24] truths are unknown
[1:01:27] open it up
[1:01:29] Lord and this messenger from the
[1:01:33] earliest part of his
[1:01:36] ministry somay the
[1:01:39] lamb will come forth and take the B and
[1:01:42] he will loose the
[1:01:44] seals someday the worthy one will
[1:01:48] come in this last day this book must be
[1:01:52] taken the lamb must come for take them
[1:01:56] up and loose the
[1:01:58] seals now when John the Baptist preached
[1:02:02] in his in his um
[1:02:06] forerunning introducing the Ephesian of
[1:02:08] that
[1:02:10] age going into the land of the New
[1:02:13] Covenant he he introduced the
[1:02:16] lamb he said behold look the lamb to
[1:02:21] take away the sin of the
[1:02:23] world well this was a to New
[1:02:27] Direction nobody had ever preached this
[1:02:30] before it had not been the message of
[1:02:33] previous
[1:02:34] time they were satisfied with their
[1:02:37] rituals with their woly lamb their
[1:02:41] sacrifices they were so sure this was
[1:02:44] the way it was supposed to
[1:02:46] be but they had been given a
[1:02:49] substitute that work until the real
[1:02:52] thing
[1:02:53] came but when the real thing came
[1:02:57] they could not accept what
[1:03:00] God now it was not just a
[1:03:03] substitute but now The Real L of God and
[1:03:07] he was
[1:03:08] introduced here he is behold the L to
[1:03:13] take away the sin of the
[1:03:15] world while even as he's preaching some
[1:03:19] of his disciples are listening and they
[1:03:22] continue following John instead of going
[1:03:25] after the L
[1:03:27] and it parallels the age that we're
[1:03:29] in because so many want to just follow
[1:03:33] the personality of the
[1:03:36] mess without following the one he
[1:03:38] pointed
[1:03:40] to and that's why they're still having
[1:03:42] to look for the messenger to to
[1:03:47] return because nothing can happen till
[1:03:49] he com
[1:03:51] back totally missing what God is doing
[1:03:55] because they never saw who the Messiah
[1:03:59] was the Messiah was not a
[1:04:02] prophet the Messiah was Christ the
[1:04:08] word so some of them they could not see
[1:04:12] who the Messiah was can follow another
[1:04:15] men and after some new doctrine and then
[1:04:19] we form clicks and clams all around the
[1:04:22] message that are centered on
[1:04:24] personalities
[1:04:27] and the reason for this they never saw
[1:04:29] the
[1:04:30] Messiah they keep looking for
[1:04:33] another and when he's off the scene they
[1:04:35] have another and then they have another
[1:04:38] or they live on the memory of of the
[1:04:40] past and it's a vicious cycle and it
[1:04:43] only causes hurt and unbelief and
[1:04:47] confusion
[1:04:49] disappoint it'll never produce faith in
[1:04:52] your life until you come to know the
[1:04:55] Messiah
[1:04:56] Jesus Christ who is the word when you
[1:04:59] know the word the Holy Ghost is here of
[1:05:04] God is here healing is here Mir here are
[1:05:09] here everything is here you get
[1:05:15] focused it doesn't require some man's
[1:05:18] personality it requires the
[1:05:23] person amen so Revelation 52 says and I
[1:05:29] saw a strong Angel proclaiming voice
[1:05:33] who's worthy to open the
[1:05:35] book to
[1:05:38] loose and we have heard a strong
[1:05:41] angel in this day Proclaim with a loud
[1:05:45] voice who is worthy where is that loud
[1:05:49] where is that worthy one and if you
[1:05:52] examine brother R's messages from the
[1:05:55] ear Tes throughout his ministry he was
[1:05:59] making this procla Proclamation who is
[1:06:02] worthy this must happen that the lamb
[1:06:05] takes the book loes The
[1:06:08] Seal amen see there's never been an age
[1:06:12] where the message of the Lamb coming
[1:06:15] take a
[1:06:16] book amen there have been many sermons
[1:06:19] preached on
[1:06:21] Calvary the cross and what Jesus did
[1:06:25] death and his burial and his
[1:06:27] resurrection and those are important but
[1:06:30] there comes a time where the focus
[1:06:33] begins to
[1:06:34] change not taken away from
[1:06:38] Calvary not taken away from the
[1:06:40] purchasing
[1:06:41] work but realizing that there is more of
[1:06:45] the Lamb's
[1:06:46] work that in
[1:06:48] Calvary there is a further work of the
[1:06:53] Lamb tman Redeemer
[1:06:56] he does more than purchase
[1:06:58] us but he claims us and that is the
[1:07:02] rapture
[1:07:03] part that's what he's done in this day
[1:07:07] he claimed you out from among
[1:07:11] denominations even as he claimed Israel
[1:07:14] from the
[1:07:16] Nations you from the
[1:07:18] denomination and bringing you to
[1:07:21] himself taking a bride what is he doing
[1:07:26] his claiming
[1:07:29] work amen amen amen now this is where
[1:07:33] people are
[1:07:34] confused because they think because the
[1:07:37] lamb is doing his claiming work by
[1:07:40] claiming the book and all those whose
[1:07:42] names are in it that is no longer doing
[1:07:45] the
[1:07:46] purchase that is true that is not true
[1:07:49] his Precious Blood will never lose his
[1:07:53] power all the church
[1:08:00] amen amen so his blood doesn't become
[1:08:04] ineffective because now he
[1:08:09] advances but his blood still the power
[1:08:13] to deliver the violent
[1:08:16] sinner to save the Lord to heal
[1:08:19] the cast devil Amen to move among his
[1:08:24] people
[1:08:26] it's his claiming work but people get
[1:08:29] confused but let me know let you know
[1:08:32] his blood is just as affective to cleans
[1:08:35] sin the day it was shed on
[1:08:38] Calvary but his kman
[1:08:41] Redeemer he does more than purchase our
[1:08:46] Salvation he is now claiming the
[1:08:49] book and take possession of his
[1:08:53] Redeemed by rapturing them
[1:08:56] amen amen amen now once he gets you
[1:08:59] safely out of his way out of the
[1:09:02] way takes you in a Rapture to the
[1:09:05] marriage sear of the Lamb he's going to
[1:09:07] do an avenging
[1:09:09] work amen amen because he's also Kinsman
[1:09:16] Avenger he's going to pour out wrath on
[1:09:21] those amen the very devil that has
[1:09:24] troubled you

[1:09:29] situations around you
[1:09:31] this God's going to plag
[1:09:34] them he's going to work do the work of
[1:09:38] Avenger because his kinsman
[1:09:42] redeemer claims and he

[1:13:15] work and fils of judgment is poured

[1:13:24] Paul
[1:13:25] the Romans Ephesians Colossians
[1:13:28] Galatians
[1:13:30] Thessalonians the Hebrews never one time
[1:13:33] does he say where is that worthy
[1:13:36] lamb The book must be taken it wasn't
[1:13:39] the cry neither was it the Cry of
[1:13:42] Iranian colba or Martin Luther Wesley
[1:13:47] you don't find it until this day this
[1:13:51] becomes the burden of the
[1:13:52] word this becomes the Cry of
[1:13:55] M who is worthy this book is closed it's
[1:14:00] sealed with seven seal it must be open

[1:14:19] open the book of the Covenant which has
[1:14:23] been sealed up must be
[1:14:27] open

[1:14:32] passion have that book
[1:14:34] open to be there and see it
[1:14:37] open bring that book to a
[1:14:40] people so they can be the people of the
[1:14:43] open
[1:14:45] book Hallelujah we are the
[1:14:49] people of the
[1:14:51] open it's no longer closed
[1:14:59] amen we have come to the breaking of the
[1:15:02] sea we have come to the breaking of the
[1:15:06] silence we have come to the place of
[1:15:10] Matthew
[1:15:13] 2436 but of that day and hour knoweth no
[1:15:19] man no not the angels of heaven but my
[1:15:23] father
[1:15:26] amen you see we shared
[1:15:29] yesterday in Acts 1 and verse
[1:15:33] 6 when they had come together they had a
[1:15:37] question for the Lord wi thou at this
[1:15:40] time restore the
[1:15:43] kingdom you see the blinding was going
[1:15:45] on so even the disciples didn't
[1:15:48] understand what they were to be looking
[1:15:51] for they didn't know where they were
[1:15:55] trying to find out where we
[1:15:57] at is this what you're going to do
[1:16:00] next and he says about that it's not for
[1:16:03] you to know the times of the
[1:16:05] Season which the father has put in his
[1:16:07] own
[1:16:08] power these are things that the eternal
[1:16:13] spirit me and my human
[1:16:16] form I can't know this I can't even tell
[1:16:19] you right now because I've come here as
[1:16:23] eternal spirit as a man
[1:16:26] and in man form I don't know
[1:16:29] this amen so he begins on the aisle of
[1:16:34] patmas after his death and
[1:16:38] Resurrection when he has ascended back
[1:16:40] to
[1:16:41] God and here he comes back to John to
[1:16:45] give him the mystery of his coming
[1:16:53] amen but every won't know
[1:16:56] it it will be reserved for an end time
[1:17:03] people now so but but he pointed them to
[1:17:08] what was
[1:17:10] important coming that they must
[1:17:13] see what you must see that you shall
[1:17:16] receive power after the Holy Ghost come
[1:17:20] upon be witness to me in Jerusalem Sam
[1:17:23] all part he says there's a coming I want
[1:17:27] you to
[1:17:28] see and it's not going to be the coming
[1:17:30] of where I'm not going to tell you about
[1:17:32] when I'm going to restore the Kingdom of
[1:17:34] Israel you not to know that this is held
[1:17:37] in the father's own power it's not
[1:17:40] permitted for me to tell it but it's
[1:17:43] something left for a later
[1:17:46] time you must know this you must get
[1:17:51] this you shall receive power after the
[1:17:54] Holy
[1:17:56] Ghost amen did he come in Acts two he
[1:17:59] came he came as a pillar of fire liit of
[1:18:04] fire and he empowered every one of
[1:18:07] them out under the power and under the
[1:18:10] anointing of the mighty Angel amen amen
[1:18:15] hallelujah amen now you must know what
[1:18:19] coming you are a part
[1:18:22] of you must receive that
[1:18:26] coming like in the book of
[1:18:29] Acts and if you receive him the Holy
[1:18:32] Spirit there is another coming in this
[1:18:36] last day and that is the coming of our
[1:18:39] Lord Jesus Christ where we will meet
[1:18:45] him but why would God not allow the
[1:18:48] mystery of his coming to be made known
[1:18:50] to
[1:18:53] this because Satan would have used this
[1:18:55] knowledge to do great damage
[1:18:58] with had the early church known that it
[1:19:01] would be some 2,000
[1:19:04] years or seven Church ages before Jesus
[1:19:08] returned there would have been no one
[1:19:10] died
[1:19:11] ready and prepared to meet
[1:19:14] him you see they were already
[1:19:18] relaxing there would have been nobody
[1:19:20] under
[1:19:21] expectation for the Lord's return and
[1:19:25] since this was
[1:19:26] withheld every soul went to the
[1:19:29] grace believing for his
[1:19:32] coming and they will
[1:19:34] rise amen with the same Bel so they went
[1:19:38] down
[1:19:38] ready and they will come up ready amen
[1:19:42] amen they didn't die in unbelief the
[1:19:45] Bible said these all died in
[1:19:47] faith go by the way of the Grave we
[1:19:51] don't die in unbelief we're not
[1:19:53] nonbelievers because we die we die
[1:19:57] looking for
[1:19:58] him come back seeing the part of the
[1:20:02] coming that he's expressing himself in
[1:20:04] our
[1:20:05] day now Paul says we have come to Mount
[1:20:09] Zion
[1:20:11] amen now notice here as we look at this
[1:20:15] you know we have come to Mount Zion m z
[1:20:19] is the
[1:20:20] bride we have come to the
[1:20:23] bride you know we're with the full
[1:20:27] grain amen we we we have water
[1:20:31] baptism we have the Holy Ghost has come
[1:20:35] the blood of Jesus has
[1:20:37] a the godhead has preached
[1:20:41] perfectly and the revelation of the
[1:20:43] Rapture is being
[1:20:45] given he said the Lord
[1:20:48] himself from heaven with a and the voice
[1:20:51] of the Archangel and the trumpet of God
[1:20:54] getting so
[1:20:56] close to it winding
[1:20:58] up and they're standing right on the
[1:21:01] brink of the
[1:21:04] Rapture and they're looking over in the
[1:21:06] promised landine and they're already
[1:21:09] seeing the order of his
[1:21:10] coming what he's going to do what he
[1:21:14] will do as he
[1:21:15] descends they're already getting
[1:21:17] Revelations of his
[1:21:19] coming I show you a
[1:21:22] mystery and there are things already
[1:21:24] starting to happen them and they're
[1:21:26] standing right on the
[1:21:28] Edge and Paul is saying to the
[1:21:32] Hebrews Hebrews chapter 12 he prefaces
[1:21:37] this and is what we have read there and
[1:21:39] he speak in Hebrews
[1:21:41] 11 David bar Samson speaks of Abraham
[1:21:46] great Heroes of Faith has gone on before
[1:21:49] them and they he tells them in in in
[1:21:53] Hebrews 12 they're like they're on a
[1:21:55] grand
[1:21:56] standand and they're cheering you on
[1:22:00] it's a great cloud of witnesses and they
[1:22:03] can't be perfect without you and he's
[1:22:06] already seeing a great cloud of
[1:22:08] witnesses we're already so
[1:22:11] close on the very edge of
[1:22:13] something Jesus has went away the Old
[1:22:16] Testament saints went with
[1:22:20] him
[1:22:22] com and Paul is preaching
[1:22:25] we which are alive and
[1:22:27] remain he didn't think he was talking to
[1:22:30] you some 2,000 years
[1:22:33] later but God holds Us blind to things
[1:22:36] until the
[1:22:38] time he don't show us
[1:22:40] everything and he was showing the great
[1:22:43] prophet Paul many things but he wasn't
[1:22:46] showing him there would be Seven Ages
[1:22:49] and you're going to go your way and
[1:22:50] sleep Paul he's preaching it like it's
[1:22:53] going to happen right now
[1:22:55] any
[1:22:56] minute we we which are
[1:22:59] alive we will not see death will be
[1:23:04] changed but he didn't know he was
[1:23:09] prophesying another
[1:23:11] day of the end
[1:23:13] time amen but it had to be written in
[1:23:17] the
[1:23:18] scripture the mystery of his
[1:23:22] coming amen hallelujah
[1:23:25] amen there were things that was said of
[1:23:29] John oh what is it to you if he ter
[1:23:33] shall I
[1:23:34] come so there was a around John would
[1:23:38] see death some of his disciples anxious
[1:23:41] for the coming of the
[1:23:42] Lord John's getting old now you see how
[1:23:46] great his hair is now he's getting
[1:23:48] feeble John tell us about his coming
[1:23:52] Jesus said you wouldn't see death see
[1:23:54] the Lord's
[1:23:56] coming and because of this
[1:23:59] s which John
[1:24:01] corrected you know he but because of
[1:24:04] this say God had the federal government
[1:24:07] to arrest
[1:24:09] him and take him to the aisle of
[1:24:12] P so he could get a little time to
[1:24:16] himself so he could show him his
[1:24:19] coming you see the dumb devil don't
[1:24:23] know everything he does to us is really
[1:24:27] going to work for
[1:24:30] our
[1:24:31] hallelujah amen amen you know there was
[1:24:34] a child One Day by the name of
[1:24:36] Moses and the devil
[1:24:39] knew that there would be a boy that God
[1:24:42] would raised up there was a prophecy
[1:24:45] said that a deliverer would be
[1:24:47] born and Satan stood there to kill Moses
[1:24:51] when he was born and put laws in place
[1:24:55] kill all the male
[1:24:57] children and God said you want to play
[1:25:00] this game I'll play one on
[1:25:03] you what I'm going to do is have you
[1:25:06] raise my deliver you will
[1:25:11] educate you will clo him and then he's
[1:25:14] going to come out one day and
[1:25:18] realize and he'll defeat you he destroy
[1:25:21] your
[1:25:24] am hallelujah amen now sometimes the
[1:25:28] devil thinks he's going to keep us in
[1:25:31] this no God is just letting him feed
[1:25:36] us give us some conveniences here but
[1:25:39] he's rais out a deliver in this
[1:25:43] last people who's going to bruise their
[1:25:49] head people who is a devil defe who is
[1:25:53] over
[1:25:55] and there is nothing the devil
[1:25:58] can keep you
[1:26:01] from amen you will
[1:26:04] overcome hallelujah
[1:26:07] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:26:11] [Applause]
[1:26:13] Lord now John sees things beginning to
[1:26:17] happen it's all in
[1:26:19] symbol parabolic
[1:26:21] form and he can't he can't say God can't
[1:26:25] say now there's going to be seven Church
[1:26:27] ages 2,000 years but he writes it in
[1:26:31] symbols he makes it in
[1:26:34] Parables because it's not for
[1:26:38] everybody they can't know this but at
[1:26:41] the end time the mystery of God will be
[1:26:46] finished amen so he says there are seven
[1:26:51] churches and they have seven character
[1:26:55] istics they they were characterized in
[1:26:57] an age we we know now but they didn't
[1:27:02] know they were characterizing an
[1:27:05] age you see if those words were truly to
[1:27:09] the
[1:27:11] leans the city of
[1:27:13] Ephesus it's their message and not
[1:27:16] ours but this was a message of Jesus
[1:27:20] Christ not to a city but speaking to an
[1:27:25] age and he's using Seven
[1:27:28] Cities to
[1:27:30] symbolize Seven Ages to
[1:27:32] come so there are seven stars in the
[1:27:35] right hand Jehovah now God's not holding
[1:27:39] Seven Stars like seven sons like seven
[1:27:43] of our sons in his right hand these are
[1:27:46] symbols of seven
[1:27:48] Messengers that he would send to give
[1:27:51] light in the time of Darkness Christ has
[1:27:54] left the
[1:27:55] Earth notice it's a time of Darkness
[1:27:59] because there's seven
[1:28:01] lampstands amen they shine in the dark
[1:28:05] Seven Stars that come out at night but
[1:28:08] when the sun comes up you don't need
[1:28:11] lamp you don't need Stars you don't see
[1:28:15] them amen but right now in this time of
[1:28:20] Darkness we need the light
[1:28:24] guide us we need the
[1:28:27] L the way
[1:28:31] the amen so John is caught
[1:28:35] up even the lamb is a
[1:28:40] symbol it's got seven horns it has seven
[1:28:44] eyes on the
[1:28:46] horn have you ever seen a
[1:28:48] lamb that could take a book out of the
[1:28:52] hand you know out of the hand of him
[1:28:54] that had on the thr got hes and he
[1:28:57] reaches up and he grabs with his
[1:29:01] hes this is no woolly
[1:29:03] lamb this is
[1:29:05] symbolic you see God is writing in
[1:29:09] symbols John doesn't even know that he's
[1:29:12] a
[1:29:14] symbol because John is representing the
[1:29:18] redeem a group of people will be caught
[1:29:22] up and raptured
[1:29:24] at the end of the
[1:29:25] age and even the 24
[1:29:28] Elders are
[1:29:30] representing a gr people 12
[1:29:34] Patriarchs and 12
[1:29:37] Apostles of the old and the new redeemed
[1:29:41] of all are all
[1:29:44] represented in
[1:29:49] the so it's all written in
[1:29:52] symbols and it parable
[1:29:56] mhm and people scratch their head and
[1:30:00] they write books about it and it's not
[1:30:02] able to be
[1:30:04] understood because it's not time for
[1:30:08] it this is why the Book of Revelation is
[1:30:11] a mysterious
[1:30:12] book and it continues to be a mysterious
[1:30:15] book
[1:30:16] people because they can't
[1:30:18] understand but God didn't put it in
[1:30:20] there just in the Bible just for filler
[1:30:22] paper
[1:30:25] I one more book
[1:30:28] end and just let me give them something
[1:30:30] to chew
[1:30:32] on but no it's a book of
[1:30:35] mystery you know like a mystery
[1:30:38] book in the beginning of the book all
[1:30:41] kinds of characters are
[1:30:43] introduced you don't know who the
[1:30:45] villain is you don't know who the bride
[1:30:48] is you don't know who the groom is but
[1:30:51] as the story comes down to the end of
[1:30:53] the book
[1:30:54] amen you know who the villain is you
[1:30:57] know who the elect is amen you know who
[1:31:00] the bride is you know who the groom is
[1:31:04] and we are not at the beginning of the
[1:31:06] book we are at the end of the book The
[1:31:10] Mystery
[1:31:12] becomes amen amen and John gets so
[1:31:16] caught up he types out the bride in
[1:31:19] Revelation
[1:31:21] 4 he is so quickened
[1:31:24] till he actually becomes the bride and
[1:31:27] type and he's caught up before the
[1:31:30] throne and he sees the Kinsman there he
[1:31:33] sees the lamb who come to get this
[1:31:35] question book of
[1:31:37] title that is in the hand of the one
[1:31:40] who he sees it unfold he he sees the
[1:31:44] lamb take the B sees him open the seals
[1:31:47] he watches these symbols under these
[1:31:49] seals and here's the final
[1:31:52] Revelation has seven Thunders now utter
[1:31:56] their amen and here's the last
[1:31:59] thing the last mystery that is needed to
[1:32:03] cap off the all the
[1:32:06] Mysteries and he hears the Revelation he
[1:32:09] gets it amen they're so close to
[1:32:13] finishing it up God calling a Rapture
[1:32:17] they got baptism right godhead right
[1:32:20] predestination right everything is
[1:32:22] ordered they're waiting for this last
[1:32:25] mystery and John hears
[1:32:28] it but what
[1:32:30] happens all of sudden God says
[1:32:33] no you can't do
[1:32:35] it I can't let this be
[1:32:38] known it's not
[1:32:41] time it's got to be written in the
[1:32:44] Bible I'll leave it in symbol
[1:32:48] for but you can't tell the
[1:32:52] meaning and there is a reason
[1:32:55] because it has to be written in the
[1:32:57] word it can't be something outside of
[1:33:00] the
[1:33:03] Bible be in the
[1:33:06] scriptures amen amen but brother
[1:33:08] brandham said it was hid in the book
[1:33:12] written Under symbols even as he did
[1:33:15] with Daniel but it could be
[1:33:18] seen you know it could be seen as
[1:33:22] symbols but they didn't have
[1:33:25] understanding until a prophet came and
[1:33:28] this is what he's saying in the days of
[1:33:30] the voice
[1:33:32] of when he shall begin to sound the
[1:33:36] mystery of God should be
[1:33:39] finished amen amen now if you take that
[1:33:42] in context with Revelation
[1:33:44] 10 it's the mystery of the voice of God
[1:33:48] that had been sealed
[1:33:51] away amen the seven
[1:33:54] God had said something but he sealed it
[1:33:57] up now but he says this is going to cap
[1:34:00] it off and John gets it he hears the
[1:34:04] Revelation they are that close the
[1:34:07] Thunders are uttering their voices I was
[1:34:10] about to write and I heard what they
[1:34:13] said God said
[1:34:15] no you can't
[1:34:20] write it's in the Bible but it
[1:34:24] symbols but I'm not going to let you
[1:34:26] give
[1:34:29] interpretation because it's not the
[1:34:32] time for it to be made
[1:34:35] known why couldn't he tell
[1:34:38] John why couldn't he let him
[1:34:41] tell we know now because there were more
[1:34:45] names in the
[1:34:46] book and God hold it back to hold it
[1:34:50] back I can't end it all yet
[1:34:53] call a
[1:34:54] Rapture there are more names that have
[1:34:58] that are in the book that hadn't been
[1:35:00] manifested on the
[1:35:02] earth amen amen John you can't tell this
[1:35:07] because if I give them Rapture and
[1:35:10] Fai amen the Rapture will take place and
[1:35:14] these other seeds will never come in the
[1:35:17] manifestation but I have more in my
[1:35:20] family what's in this Ephesian age
[1:35:23] you do this now there will never be an
[1:35:26] evening light Tabernacle evening light
[1:35:28] Tabernacle or there will never be a
[1:35:29] Cloverdale Bible or light in the evening
[1:35:33] time
[1:35:35] church so therefore if I tell it now
[1:35:40] it'll call the end and there will be a
[1:35:43] Rapture so I will have to hold it back
[1:35:46] because otherwise there won't be an
[1:35:51] Iranian wle or br
[1:35:54] there wouldn't be any of them they would
[1:35:56] never come into
[1:35:58] manifestation so I can't the
[1:36:02] church can't give the
[1:36:06] my hold
[1:36:08] it till the last
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:13] day now can you imagine being that close
[1:36:17] having all the
[1:36:18] Mysteries they were
[1:36:20] seed this church was a seed Church
[1:36:24] was a grain of wheat it should have been
[1:36:27] taken and harvested taken into the
[1:36:32] Garner amen amen but instead God planted
[1:36:37] it right amen so that there would be
[1:36:40] more amen so God had more in mind than
[1:36:44] what was in the
[1:36:46] Ephesian God had some better things for
[1:36:49] us he had you in mind let me say it like
[1:36:52] this you how many of you were born let's
[1:36:56] say third or fourth or fifth or
[1:36:59] thereafter in your family raise your
[1:37:01] hand you was the third fourth
[1:37:05] fth in your family you weren the first
[1:37:10] two you know we we have we have here
[1:37:15] Brother David he's got three
[1:37:18] children what have he said boy and a
[1:37:22] girl
[1:37:24] that makes a complete family we don't
[1:37:27] need no more we got
[1:37:28] one what about
[1:37:30] you you wouldn't have been
[1:37:33] here but God had something more in
[1:37:36] mind to make his family
[1:37:39] complete and so God did the same thing I
[1:37:42] can't Rapture this
[1:37:44] age I've got a planet so there will be
[1:37:48] more
[1:37:50] coming there's more in the book
[1:37:54] that what's been manifested on the earth
[1:37:57] I have to wait until every one of them
[1:37:59] are manifested on the
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:09] earth you know I wouldn't have been here
[1:38:12] either I was the fourth
[1:38:15] child you know God would have stop you
[1:38:18] wouldn't be in the picture you have
[1:38:21] never come into manifestation
[1:38:23] even though Paul in his age could have
[1:38:26] been
[1:38:27] raptured and they were so
[1:38:30] close God had something more in
[1:38:33] mind he had you in
[1:38:36] mind and all of this time the lamb has
[1:38:40] been
[1:38:41] interceding through these Seven
[1:38:44] Ages on the behalf of ignorance
[1:38:47] providing
[1:38:51] Grace now maybe I don't know know all
[1:38:53] the
[1:38:54] history it is said of Martin Luther that
[1:38:57] he hated the Jews some say he smoked the
[1:39:00] PIP some ate cursed and drank wine we do
[1:39:04] know this Luther was sprinkled in titles
[1:39:08] of Father Son and
[1:39:10] Holy and I'll just tell you you can't
[1:39:12] make the Rapture with that kind of
[1:39:15] Bap right amen but Luther would have
[1:39:18] believed
[1:39:19] this he was a predestinated seed Wesley
[1:39:24] would have believed
[1:39:25] this but it wasn't given yet there was
[1:39:29] no
[1:39:30] restoration them back to the
[1:39:33] original therefore God provided Grace
[1:39:36] for them and they will be in the great
[1:39:41] Resurrection be part of the Bride of
[1:39:43] Jesus Christ because they were
[1:39:47] predestinated live long
[1:39:49] enough God's allowed you to live
[1:39:53] so as you can see Luther had so many
[1:39:57] things mixed
[1:39:58] up there was a lamb sitting on
[1:40:01] the and if that lamb could atone for
[1:40:05] Luther's his
[1:40:07] unbelief what about
[1:40:09] your and your
[1:40:11] unbelief therefore he was interceding a
[1:40:14] bloody lamb and every time Satan would
[1:40:17] come I wipe Luther off of the Earth the
[1:40:20] lamb would say but that's my son the
[1:40:23] lamb would say take all his sin and put
[1:40:27] it upon me and he does this until every
[1:40:32] name in the
[1:40:35] book
[1:40:38] amen hallelujah amen now we have come
[1:40:42] back to the same point that the first
[1:40:45] age
[1:40:46] was we come back now to where there's a
[1:40:48] people on Earth who believes every word
[1:40:53] that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:40:55] God so you see as we look at this we are
[1:40:59] right back to the place where man fell
[1:41:02] in the
[1:41:03] garden where we go back from time into
[1:41:06] eternity we're right back to where they
[1:41:09] were in the New
[1:41:11] Covenant as the original grain to be the
[1:41:14] original grain
[1:41:15] again in the first seal brother ROM says
[1:41:19] now the lamb is showing John in the SYM
[1:41:22] of the church
[1:41:25] the for the church you know what to
[1:41:28] write he just he just shows him now
[1:41:30] don't tell
[1:41:32] this just what it
[1:41:34] is and don't go down John and say now
[1:41:38] this is just what this is now what's
[1:41:40] under this seventh seal don't go down
[1:41:43] and tell that for if I tell John that
[1:41:47] down all down to the age the whole plan
[1:41:50] will be brok it's a secret
[1:41:54] see nobody's going to know when I'm
[1:41:56] coming just coming it ain't for it ain't
[1:42:01] for my business to know when
[1:42:04] ready so God sealed the understanding of
[1:42:08] the of the seven seal book from those
[1:42:11] ages Until the End Time begin every seal
[1:42:15] is written in the
[1:42:17] book but the interpretation is
[1:42:21] with it is sealed under
[1:42:24] symbol the symbol is written but the
[1:42:27] interpretation is held
[1:42:31] back and yet John heard the
[1:42:35] interpretation it was an intelligence
[1:42:37] intelligent
[1:42:39] utterance he was going to write it but
[1:42:42] he was forbidden to
[1:42:44] do amen amen now in Revelation
[1:42:48] 81 when he had opened the seventh seal
[1:42:51] there was silence in heaven
[1:42:54] for the space of an half an hour that's
[1:42:57] all you know about it something's been
[1:43:00] silent it represents a time of
[1:43:02] Silence then come to Revelation
[1:43:05] 10 Revelation 10 it becomes a known
[1:43:10] voice it is prophesied to become a known
[1:43:15] voice let's just go around through
[1:43:17] Revelation
[1:43:18] 10 and let's look at the
[1:43:21] symbols Revelation 101 and I saw another
[1:43:25] Mighty
[1:43:26] Angel come down from heaven clothe with
[1:43:29] the cloud a rainbow is upon his head and
[1:43:32] his face
[1:43:33] as so this is the Angel of the
[1:43:37] Covenant none other that the Lord Jesus
[1:43:41] Christ
[1:43:42] amen because he's the angel of the
[1:43:45] Covenant represented by the
[1:43:48] Covenant the seven colors of the rainbow
[1:43:53] all right amen his face is as was the
[1:43:56] sun this is not the veiling of God this
[1:44:00] is the time of the unveil of
[1:44:02] God this is when his light comes in the
[1:44:06] evening
[1:44:07] time and his feet as
[1:44:11] pillars now this is
[1:44:14] symbology you see here now he's coming
[1:44:18] but this is not the physical Corporal
[1:44:21] return of Christ
[1:44:24] this is Christ as he comes in the form
[1:44:27] of the
[1:44:28] word to a Prophet this is the logos the
[1:44:33] spirit now to come into the
[1:44:36] messenger bring a message of
[1:44:40] Deliverance now it's the hour of
[1:44:42] deliver home time AG it's the seventh
[1:44:46] age here we are here we have
[1:44:49] come we have come right here to the
[1:44:51] scripture
[1:44:53] we have arrived at Revelation 10 are you
[1:44:57] with me but notice what he said his feet
[1:45:02] were as pillars of fire well the Bible
[1:45:05] answers the
[1:45:07] symbology let's go to Ephesians 1
[1:45:10] verse and the Bible said and he put all
[1:45:14] things under his
[1:45:17] feet and gave him to be the head over
[1:45:21] all things to the
[1:45:24] which is his
[1:45:26] body the fullness of him that fth
[1:45:31] all right amen so you see he's the head
[1:45:36] but his body is on
[1:45:37] Earth come on amen amen this is why when
[1:45:41] we see even the picture of the
[1:45:44] cloud it's just the head why the body is
[1:45:48] on
[1:45:49] Earth amen and what is it it is his feet
[1:45:53] is in his body and his feet are
[1:45:58] pillars not a pillar of
[1:46:01] fire but pillars of
[1:46:04] fire now where is that in the Bible and
[1:46:08] suddenly there came a
[1:46:10] sound like a
[1:46:12] Russ and what happened
[1:46:14] to
[1:46:17] divided
[1:46:19] of
[1:46:21] people hallelujah am you are his
[1:46:26] [Music]
[1:46:27] feet amen you're his feet through which
[1:46:38] heck amen
[1:46:42] hallelujah and he had in his hand a
[1:46:46] little book open Revelation 5 he was
[1:46:50] closed but now the lamb has stepped
[1:46:52] forth
[1:46:54] and he comes down with the open book
[1:46:57] amen amen it doesn't remain in the
[1:47:00] heavens he comes out to bring it to
[1:47:03] you he didn't redeem it for
[1:47:06] himself he was already
[1:47:08] redeemed but he became a man and as your
[1:47:12] Redeemer the
[1:47:14] K A kman he took your place and there he
[1:47:20] stands head of the
[1:47:24] he takes the
[1:47:26] book for man but he don't leave it in
[1:47:30] the he comes down with the open book as
[1:47:34] brother said he would tear off the seal
[1:47:38] and hand it
[1:47:41] down
[1:47:43] amen what was he doing bringing to you
[1:47:46] an open
[1:47:48] book amen amen and he set his right foot
[1:47:52] on the sea and his left foot on the
[1:47:56] earth now this is no 275 me tall
[1:48:02] Jesus with one great big foot over here
[1:48:06] one great foot over there this is

[1:48:12] symbols CU out of the
[1:48:15] Landes a beast and out of the sea Rises

[1:48:24] them amen he is saying you cannot come

[1:50:29] message he shouts

[1:50:35] shouts and when he shouts it's like one

[1:52:39] before
[1:52:41] but you don't start a complete
[1:52:45] thought said silence this but in the
[1:52:51] days of the
[1:52:54] of the seven Angel
[1:52:59] when mystery theery of God which has
[1:53:07] beeny would be
[1:53:11] finished because he's
[1:53:13] declared prophesied of his
[1:53:16] coming down to the
[1:53:18] Ages Every Prophet was prophesying
[1:53:23] of the

[1:53:29] Abraham well take another en what with
[1:53:33] God seventh from
[1:53:36] Adam amen come on and he was not he was
[1:53:40] raptured the seventh Church age from the
[1:53:43] seventh from the the seventh from Adam
[1:53:47] the second we're from the seventh from
[1:53:48] the
[1:53:50] second Abraham what about that mystery
[1:53:54] God wrote it and hid it in his life it
[1:53:58] was Christ the mystery of Christ hidden
[1:54:02] in Abraham but reveal to you in this
[1:54:06] day that the old woman Sarah 2000 years
[1:54:11] old is going to bring forth the
[1:54:15] prise
[1:54:16] am and to do that you're going to be
[1:54:19] changed so there will be a kind of time
[1:54:22] I can't keep it
[1:54:24] quiet you're going to know what the
[1:54:26] Thunder uttering the last Revelation to
[1:54:30] be given that will cap off all
[1:54:33] the will be given to an end time
[1:54:36] people but I'm going to give Rapture in
[1:54:38] faith in other words I'm going to give
[1:54:41] them the faith
[1:54:45] that I'm going to tell them you are the
[1:54:49] people of the open book and I'm going to
[1:54:52] open the whole book
[1:54:55] to amen amen amen you don't lose it with
[1:54:59] PRI with prob into
[1:55:02] it the just shall live
[1:55:04] by but that's all he could
[1:55:07] see W would come along but you got to be
[1:55:10] Sanctified He pry into it try to
[1:55:15] understand but in this day the
[1:55:18] understanding
[1:55:22] amen the mystery is
[1:55:24] revealed so this half hour Silence has
[1:55:28] to do with the end time has to do with
[1:55:30] our Lord's return it's the very thing
[1:55:33] that Jesus said the Angels did not
[1:55:36] know seal is open John sees there's a
[1:55:40] half an hour
[1:55:41] silence this silence is
[1:55:44] symbol it's the symbol of the Sabbath
[1:55:47] seal Sabbath seal is represented by a
[1:55:51] Time
[1:55:53] just like white horse is a symbol of the
[1:55:56] ver seal and like God the fifth seal
[1:56:01] people and when this sea was
[1:56:05] open had been
[1:56:07] silenced now yeah brother bandam said
[1:56:10] there's no symbol to give it
[1:56:12] away he referred to a horse rider no
[1:56:15] white one there's no red one there's no
[1:56:16] black one no pale one there's nothing
[1:56:18] like that
[1:56:20] silence just a time of
[1:56:24] and John when that first seal was
[1:56:27] open seeing the symbol he sees a white
[1:56:30] horse red black a
[1:56:33] pale a multitude without number under
[1:56:36] the
[1:56:37] alter 44,000 and we come to the seventh
[1:56:41] seene something has been
[1:56:44] silent not forever but for a
[1:56:48] time and it's represented by a space of
[1:56:52] a
[1:56:54] half now I'm just going to deal with
[1:56:57] some thoughts that
[1:56:59] people some Tau the reason there was
[1:57:02] silence in heaven in the space of a half
[1:57:04] an hour is because heaven had emptied
[1:57:08] the mighty Angel Revelation
[1:57:11] came I don't want to
[1:57:13] argue but if that is true then why
[1:57:16] didn't the heaven become silence when
[1:57:19] God came down to Moses in the burning
[1:57:21] bush
[1:57:23] or when he appeared as
[1:57:24] eloh Abraham was Heaven
[1:57:28] silence did Heaven All Of Heaven empty
[1:57:31] out because all of them were
[1:57:33] there there was God and two angels when
[1:57:37] God came down in the fullness of the
[1:57:40] god the fullness of the god dwelt in
[1:57:43] human
[1:57:45] flesh their their God is present and
[1:57:49] embodied in a man man Christ Jesus why
[1:57:53] was Heaven in silence for 3 33 and A2
[1:57:57] years or for three and a half
[1:58:00] years see just don't add
[1:58:03] up others come along and say we are in a
[1:58:06] time of Silence now you know we're in
[1:58:09] the seventh seal and it's all silence
[1:58:12] That's why nothing is happening you know
[1:58:14] there's no Miracles there's no healing
[1:58:17] no deliver nothing happening in the
[1:58:19] bride it's a time of Sil no no the
[1:58:23] reason that is happening to you because
[1:58:25] Leia has
[1:58:27] blinded see what God is you're not
[1:58:30] becoming the voice of the
[1:58:32] res because we are to be the voice of
[1:58:36] them that come out of dark
[1:58:40] denom we not dead we are alive we got
[1:58:45] the king to death and of hell man
[1:58:49] Satan's kingdom cannot stand against us
[1:58:52] I can unlock any
[1:58:55] door so what was it it was something God
[1:58:59] had
[1:59:00] s for time and now in heaven space of a
[1:59:05] half an hour where something has been
[1:59:08] silent but not forever just for a space
[1:59:12] of time you know for seven Church ages
[1:59:16] this has been
[1:59:18] silent amen but in the days of The Voice
[1:59:22] of the seventh angel I'm going to break
[1:59:25] the
[1:59:26] silence I'm going to let you know whatst
[1:59:30] is it's not going to remain symbols
[1:59:33] anymore and and it won't be just cities
[1:59:36] over there in some mysterious stars in
[1:59:39] his
[1:59:40] hand funny looking lamb up there in the
[1:59:43] heaven it won't be seven lamb there all
[1:59:47] of a sudden Revelation begins to
[1:59:50] dark it won't be that just a white horse
[1:59:53] and we don't know who it is some say
[1:59:56] it's Christ even brother ROM thought it
[1:59:59] was Christ preached it that way amen a
[2:00:02] black horse we a red horse we don't know
[2:00:05] who it is but now the voice of God
[2:00:09] speaks out amen and the Thunder of God
[2:00:13] begin to speak
[2:00:16] clearly lay in the
[2:00:19] scripture from our view because it was
[2:00:22] hidden behind
[2:00:24] symbol that only a prophet could
[2:00:28] Reve therefore God
[2:00:31] silenced the voices of Thunder but he
[2:00:35] reserved them to be
[2:00:38] revealed so the seventh seal is the seal
[2:00:41] that ends up all
[2:00:44] things you see when it
[2:00:46] breaks it the end time
[2:00:50] Begins the silence is
[2:00:53] broken amen the end time process begins
[2:00:56] to happen it starts bringing about the
[2:00:58] end of the
[2:01:00] Gentile it begins with the seventh angel
[2:01:04] the sounding of his
[2:01:06] message there begins to wind up all
[2:01:09] things concerning
[2:01:11] Redemption and finishes up by ushering
[2:01:15] the amen it covers the coming of the
[2:01:20] Lord and the coming of the
[2:01:24] so brother random says It's the End of
[2:01:27] Time for all
[2:01:28] things everybody ends it's the end of
[2:01:32] the struggling
[2:01:33] world the end of the struggling nature
[2:01:36] it's the end of everything it's the end
[2:01:38] of the trumpet it's the end of the V
[2:01:41] it's the end of the Earth even the end
[2:01:44] of time everything runs out in this time
[2:01:47] at the end of the seventh SE it's even
[2:01:50] the time for all
[2:01:54] the
[2:01:55] Millen amen so when the secret is made
[2:02:00] known he's letting you know you are now
[2:02:05] in time of
[2:02:09] coming and what am I
[2:02:11] doing I'm going to send you Elijah
[2:02:14] the I'm going to send
[2:02:17] the to
[2:02:19] introduce word
[2:02:22] is Christ and that that word become
[2:02:26] fles Hallelujah and a bride created on
[2:02:30] Earth and when I get her all
[2:02:33] together into the word I'm going to take
[2:02:36] her
[2:02:40] in but I'm not stopping there I'm ending
[2:02:44] up all things I'm going end up the
[2:02:47] trumpets so the seven trumpet will call
[2:02:49] Israel reveal their Messiah
[2:02:52] and then we'll come into the next FS
[2:02:55] they will be poured out for of judgment
[2:02:58] and come on to the of the
[2:03:02] Millennium all under the
[2:03:06] seventh the seventh seal is not a
[2:03:10] singular
[2:03:13] event
[2:03:15] amen it is the
[2:03:17] beginning of the end am when it open
[2:03:22] it ushers in the end
[2:03:25] time how does it do it it comes
[2:03:32] out look it's kind of like a
[2:03:37] wedding you know in this wedding there's
[2:03:41] a bride there's a
[2:03:44] grand right mm so what what happens now
[2:03:48] I'll just talk about American Wedding
[2:03:51] girls like candles in the
[2:03:54] way we have seven
[2:03:57] candles and all of a sudden now here we
[2:04:00] come and we're viewing seven
[2:04:03] candles but the wedding can't
[2:04:05] start until the last Candle is
[2:04:09] lit and the last candle is the last
[2:04:13] Church age and it's light is the last
[2:04:18] messenger and so it comes out here the
[2:04:23] call but all of a
[2:04:26] sudden here comes the last
[2:04:28] candle now we're ready music

[2:04:45] bride never gets the best man we're not
[2:04:48] marrying the Propet
[2:04:54] so he comes in ushering in the
[2:04:58] groom and here he is how do we know he's
[2:05:01] the he's the word he deserves the
[2:05:05] thoughts he's never
[2:05:10] wrong amen amen amen amen but now watch
[2:05:15] then the music changes
[2:05:17] again and here comes the bride
[2:05:22] Hallelujah now look all eyes turn the
[2:05:28] Bri and she is ushered down the aisle on
[2:05:33] now and here we've had it all of the
[2:05:36] groomsmen have taken place they standing

[2:05:54] lamb and his
[2:05:55] bride

[2:06:04] comes brother bradam says it's like a
[2:06:06] Roman
[2:06:09] can from this explosion another
[2:06:12] explosion five more stars come out
[2:06:15] another here another display another so
[2:06:19] the word comes to the prophet
[2:06:21] rejected and
[2:06:22] crucified and the the church is rejected
[2:06:26] she's identified as the of
[2:06:28] Revelation
[2:06:29] 17 the bride is called out and that
[2:06:32] causes the people to be called by his
[2:06:34] name amen and they go in a Rapture amen
[2:06:38] and then the seventh seal
[2:06:41] concludes unfolding pouring
[2:06:46] outes all these other
[2:06:48] thingses up the
[2:06:51] what I'm trying to tell you friends is
[2:06:54] that the end has
[2:06:57] begun amen amen amen amen and you are
[2:07:03] part of the
[2:07:05] prophecy amen amen amen now think of it
[2:07:10] brother Brandon said the seventh seal
[2:07:12] mystery in the book of
[2:07:15] redemption but it's
[2:07:17] broke the lamb breaks
[2:07:21] you see the seventh seal mystery in the
[2:07:25] book of redemption
[2:07:28] was think of it's brok the silence is
[2:07:33] broken it's no more silence anymore it
[2:07:38] becomes a known
[2:07:40] voice now we've had every kind of
[2:07:43] idea brother said I'm going to tell you
[2:07:46] my
[2:07:46] Revelation and I'm not prone to be a
[2:07:49] fanatic he said I am I'm ignorant of it
[2:07:53] I'm not given to Delirious or carrying
[2:07:56] on imaginary
[2:07:59] things I've said things that might seem
[2:08:04] strange just as certain as I stand on
[2:08:07] the I had the Revelation that it's in a
[2:08:11] threefold manner that I will speak to
[2:08:13] you by
[2:08:15] God here's a
[2:08:17] revelation what happens is those seven
[2:08:21] that he heard ther and was forbidden to
[2:08:25] write that's what the mystery is laying
[2:08:30] behind the seven consecutive Thunders
[2:08:33] rolling
[2:08:34] out so that's what the silence
[2:08:37] was God
[2:08:40] silence and reserve them to be
[2:08:44] revealed in your
[2:08:46] time so that blessed are your
[2:08:49] ears here and your
[2:08:54] eyes and it's no longer in symbols any
[2:08:58] but it's been
[2:08:59] reveal hallelujah amen amen Amen brother
[2:09:03] Bram said it's the secret no one knows
[2:09:06] about joh was forbidden to write about
[2:09:10] WR even a symbol about it that's why
[2:09:12] there was no activity in heaven it might
[2:09:15] give away the secret see so great it
[2:09:18] must be included because it's got to
[2:09:21] happen
[2:09:22] in other words this has got to be
[2:09:23] revealed must be made known but it's
[2:09:26] such a great
[2:09:28] thing silence
[2:09:31] for that's what Revelation 10 is seven
[2:09:35] Thunders he said utter Right In A Row 1
[2:09:39] 2
[2:09:40] 3 straight Heavens Couldn't Write it
[2:09:44] Heavens couldn't know it nothing else
[2:09:47] Satan could do get a hold of it do great
[2:09:50] damage and he went out
[2:09:53] in but now that you're here and there's
[2:09:56] no more anges he said you're in
[2:10:00] the you are in the hour of his coming
[2:10:03] you are the people of the open you are
[2:10:06] the people of
[2:10:08] the
[2:10:10] amen to the others it was Kept
[2:10:14] Secret but it's not it's not a
[2:10:17] secret you now know what the Thunders
[2:10:22] uttered the interpretation now has been
[2:10:26] given we know it's no longer
[2:10:29] symbol amen it's now
[2:10:34] Revelation it's been
[2:10:36] revealed amen amen now this is this is
[2:10:41] why God shows these things in our
[2:10:45] day there are three phases to his coming
[2:10:48] the shout The Voice the trumpet
[2:10:51] the shout what was it the message the
[2:10:55] voice of the Archangel show me any other
[2:10:59] place the
[2:11:00] AR except
[2:11:02] Revelation and then
[2:11:04] trumpet
[2:11:06] amen you see this was the third pull of
[2:11:09] brother
[2:11:11] BR people are looking for the third
[2:11:13] po well you're looking for is the
[2:11:18] manifestation Resurrection fishes
[2:11:21] all of those things that's not the third
[2:11:23] po that is
[2:11:26] manifestation the power that lays in the
[2:11:29] word with me salvation deliver speak in
[2:11:33] the storm but he said I got my mind on
[2:11:36] this message that's that third
[2:11:39] p and you see he was given the
[2:11:43] King this is not a
[2:11:46] king this is the word of the Lord put it
[2:11:49] in your hand
[2:11:52] that third
[2:11:53] P amen amen he said now now when he
[2:11:57] begins to
[2:11:58] declare first P healing second proph
[2:12:03] third the opening of the word the Myster
[2:12:06] Reve there's no more higher order to
[2:12:10] Reve Prophet can beated the word and
[2:12:14] remember third
[2:12:16] po the third
[2:12:18] po the opening of them seven to reveal
[2:12:22] that hidden fruit that been sealed in
[2:12:25] the
[2:12:27] word look brother brandom had always
[2:12:29] look
[2:12:30] for another gift another greater gift of
[2:12:34] Miracles gift of healing greater gift to
[2:12:37] the
[2:12:38] miraculous and that's what he thought he
[2:12:40] was going to get he had his first pull
[2:12:43] was given a greater
[2:12:46] giftal but this was now the third pull
[2:12:51] and it was a greater gift of healing
[2:12:54] than any of the others because it was
[2:12:57] the healing of the
[2:12:59] CH taking her out of
[2:13:02] false and restoring her back
[2:13:06] to the bride to be the bride she was the
[2:13:10] beginning do you hear what I'm saying
[2:13:13] amen this was his Divine Healing
[2:13:16] movement the last of his ministry to
[2:13:20] heal the church
[2:13:22] sin doubt
[2:13:25] confusion do you know this
[2:13:29] alone identifies brother BR as the
[2:13:32] messenger the
[2:13:34] angel of of Revelation 10 if brother
[2:13:38] Bram did not reveal the
[2:13:40] seven he was not the seventh
[2:13:45] angel yes sir but if he was the
[2:13:49] seven only he
[2:13:52] could
[2:13:53] tell what had
[2:13:56] been every other
[2:13:59] person with their idea this idea or is
[2:14:03] that is that it's all
[2:14:07] wrong because you see it's like in the
[2:14:09] days of Daniel I told you this before
[2:14:13] but in the days of Daniel God wrote
[2:14:17] something and nobody understand
[2:14:22] God spoke it might as well be a
[2:14:25] thunder
[2:14:27] understood amen and this one came out
[2:14:30] and G that one came out and Matthew
[2:14:40] Henry but nobody
[2:14:44] understood Prophet came said here's
[2:14:49] the am what is it he's no longer
[2:14:52] guessing he's no longer proven in the
[2:14:56] book that's why he could say the seal
[2:14:59] open that which I proved that that which
[2:15:03] we were all wondering about about the
[2:15:13] beginning
[2:15:17] that book is open and we can say
[2:15:21] say
[2:15:23] Lord who can
[2:15:31] propes
[2:15:33] amen hallelujah amen brother bam said
[2:15:37] from the seventh angels and he says
[2:15:40] messenger of the seventh
[2:15:42] seal message from the seventh Angels
[2:15:47] message in Revelation 10 SE
[2:15:51] to the trumpets between those two times
[2:15:54] I want you to catch
[2:15:56] this
[2:15:59] Angel of
