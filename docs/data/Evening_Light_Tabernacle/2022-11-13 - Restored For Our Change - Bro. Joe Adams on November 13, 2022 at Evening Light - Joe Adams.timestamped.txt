[54:22] flow through and come through the
[54:24] channel of the thought Lord Through the
[54:25] Bible the channel of the Mind into the
[54:28] depths of the spirit down into the soul
[54:30] father is your problem saying that's
[54:32] what has life in it and that brings life
[54:34] into us so God now may your spirit just
[54:37] grab hold of the word today Lord and may
[54:40] our Spirits grab hold of it today Father
[54:42] may it bring life into us God may we put
[54:45] our attention away from all the cares of
[54:47] this life and things that are going on
[54:49] outside of these walls today Lord and
[54:51] allow your allow yourself just to move
[54:54] Lord
[54:56] allow your spirit to move today God may
[54:59] we not hinder you today we ask it in
[55:01] Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles
[55:04] this morning
[55:05] we're going to have you turn here to
[55:07] First Corinthians 15 and we're going to
[55:10] start at verse 35 and kind of skip
[55:12] around here but I want to pick back up
[55:14] on what I spoke to you last time on
[55:17] I want to speak to in your on a restored
[55:20] for our change
[55:22] restored for our change
[55:26] last time we spoke on Satan can't stop
[55:28] our change this time I want to speak on
[55:31] restored for our change and we look here
[55:33] it says in verse 35 but some man will
[55:36] say how are the dead raised up and what
[55:39] body do they come
[55:43] you know thank God we had a prophet
[55:44] because we would all Ponder this thought
[55:47] what body would they come in he said
[55:49] thou food that which sow us is not quick
[55:50] and accept it die and that which thou
[55:53] soweth thou soweth not the body that
[55:55] shall be but bear grain it may chance of
[55:59] wheat or of some other grain but God
[56:01] giveth it a body as it had pleased him
[56:04] and to every seed of his own body All
[56:07] Flesh is not the same flesh but there is
[56:10] one kind of Flesh of men another flesh
[56:13] of beasts and other fishes and another
[56:14] of birds
[56:16] there is also celestial bodies and
[56:18] bodies of terrestrial but the glory of
[56:21] the celestial is one in the glory of the
[56:24] terrestrial is another there is one
[56:26] glory of the son and another glory of
[56:28] the Moon and another glory of the stars
[56:30] from one star different from another
[56:33] star in glory
[56:34] so also is the resurrection of the dead
[56:37] it is sown and incorruption or it is
[56:40] sown in corruption it is raised in
[56:42] incorruption
[56:44] it is sown in dishonor it is raised in
[56:47] the glory it is sown in weakness it is
[56:49] raised in power it is sown in a natural
[56:52] body it is raised a spiritual body there
[56:55] is a natural body and there is a
[56:57] spiritual body and so it is written the
[56:59] first man Adam was made a living Soul
[57:01] the last Adam was made a quickening
[57:03] spirit how be it that was not the first
[57:06] which is spiritual but that which is
[57:08] natural and that word that which is
[57:10] spiritual the first man is of the earth
[57:12] Earthly the second man is of the Lord
[57:14] From Heaven as it is earthy such are
[57:16] they also that are Earthly
[57:19] and that is Heavenly search are they
[57:21] also that are Heavenly and we have borne
[57:23] the image of the earthy how many can say
[57:25] Amen to that
[57:27] he says we shall also bear the image of
[57:29] the Heavenly praise the Lord Church
[57:32] now this I say Brethren that flesh and
[57:35] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[57:37] neither through with corruption inherit
[57:39] incorruption but I'll show you a mystery
[57:42] we shall not all sleep but we shall be
[57:45] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[57:48] an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[57:51] shall sound of the Dead shall be raised
[57:53] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[57:57] for this corruptable must put on in
[57:59] corruption and this Mortal must put on
[58:03] immortality God bless you you can have
[58:05] your seats this morning
[58:07] mm-hmm
[58:09] [Music]
[58:11] this word changed here remember the last
[58:13] time we spoke it actually means to
[58:15] exchange from one form to another form
[58:18] it means to transform and brother
[58:21] Brandon would tell us in the message the
[58:22] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[58:24] he says now when you see the women just
[58:26] go on the Rampage
[58:28] he says just doing anything that they
[58:30] want to do wash the church is doing the
[58:33] same thing so I bring this out because
[58:35] we realize the day in which we're living
[58:37] in we're seeing that it's a woman's age
[58:39] correct
[58:40] and we realize we're only able to see
[58:42] and the prophet that God will see us or
[58:44] would tell us a little to see a means
[58:45] woman in the Greek this is a woman's
[58:48] world it's a woman's church it's a
[58:49] woman's age we find out now that she's
[58:52] idolized she's worshiped she can pretty
[58:54] much do anything that she wants women
[58:56] have broken the glass ceiling
[58:58] we find women now are in in professional
[59:01] careers they're they're coaching
[59:03] professional sports or umpire
[59:04] professional games games that were
[59:07] intended only for males now the females
[59:09] are in that she's she's able to do
[59:11] whatever she wants and this is no bash
[59:13] against you sisters but we find that
[59:15] it's it's a woman's world today and when
[59:17] you see the woman doing that right the
[59:19] prophet of God will tell us but when you
[59:21] watch the spiritual bride he says when
[59:24] she begins to have a Revival when she
[59:26] begins to come back and line herself up
[59:28] with the word of God he says now watch
[59:30] then again you see how the scriptures at
[59:33] that time he said there'll be a message
[59:35] sweep out and catch that bride
[59:39] come on little bride
[59:41] so you just look around and you can see
[59:43] it's a woman's age and she's elevated
[59:45] she's been elevated to a place and when
[59:48] she's elevated to that place it's only a
[59:50] type that God is going to send a message
[59:52] and it may say God has already sent a
[59:54] message to catch the bride of Christ he
[59:57] says to catch that woman the elect so
[1:00:00] this message that God sent was to catch
[1:00:02] you to pull you out of denominational
[1:00:04] thinking to pull you out of the things
[1:00:07] of the world that's why God sent a
[1:00:09] message
[1:00:10] see this message was to catch that elect
[1:00:12] lady to catch you and draw you out of
[1:00:14] the filth of the Lord to let you know
[1:00:16] that you are of that elect to let you
[1:00:18] know that you are the bride of Christ
[1:00:20] and he says now when the people begin to
[1:00:23] try to align with the word he said there
[1:00:25] comes a fresh message
[1:00:28] so notice a fresh message not a dead
[1:00:30] letter not a message from previous ages
[1:00:33] but a fresh message a message that has
[1:00:35] life in it
[1:00:37] see a message this message wasn't just
[1:00:39] sent to tell you who you were
[1:00:42] he wasn't just sent to tell you that
[1:00:45] your bride but this message was sent to
[1:00:47] prepare your way out
[1:00:49] this message was sent to provide you a
[1:00:51] way of Escape before Israel can leave
[1:00:54] Egypt they had to have a message
[1:00:56] and before we can take our Exodus God
[1:00:58] has to send us a a message and I believe
[1:01:01] he's done that so this message was sent
[1:01:04] to change your life how many can say
[1:01:06] Amen to that
[1:01:07] it was sent to change your life change
[1:01:10] your nature change your desires and
[1:01:13] finally change your body
[1:01:15] see it was sent to restore us back to
[1:01:18] the thoughts that God had of us when it
[1:01:20] was in the back part of his mind that's
[1:01:23] what this message was sent for it wasn't
[1:01:25] sent here just so you can sit on a Pew
[1:01:27] and say I believe God sent a prophet but
[1:01:29] it was sent to do more for you than that
[1:01:31] this message was sent to to restore us
[1:01:34] back to what God had intended us to be
[1:01:36] in the beginning and notice Satan fights
[1:01:38] it he fights this little group of people
[1:01:41] he doesn't want you to be restored back
[1:01:43] to that original word he doesn't want
[1:01:45] you to be restored back to that original
[1:01:46] life he's doing everything he can to
[1:01:49] hinder the movement of the spirit and he
[1:01:51] comes even an even like Tabernacle and
[1:01:54] he'll set a critical spirit in the midst
[1:01:55] and cause the church to not Prosper
[1:01:58] cause the the word to not go forth
[1:02:01] because why because he has got a desire
[1:02:03] to keep a people beat down he's got to
[1:02:05] die keeping the people living below
[1:02:06] their privileges he's got a desire to
[1:02:08] keep the people from realizing that
[1:02:10] you're being restored back to the
[1:02:12] original word back to a body change
[1:02:14] we're not meant to be here Church we're
[1:02:17] not Earthbound chickens but we're Eagles
[1:02:19] [Applause]
[1:02:20] oh notice now he's fighting that because
[1:02:23] he knows when this change takes place
[1:02:25] his destruction is coming you say
[1:02:28] brother Joe I need a scripture on that
[1:02:30] second Thessalonians 2 and verse 7. it
[1:02:32] says for the mystery of iniquity doeth
[1:02:34] already worked only he who now let us
[1:02:38] will let until he be taken out of the
[1:02:39] way who is he the Holy Ghost where's the
[1:02:42] Holy Ghost in you this morning then
[1:02:44] shall the wicked be revealed whom the
[1:02:46] Lord shall consume with the spirit of
[1:02:48] his mouth and shall destroy with the
[1:02:50] brightness of his coming
[1:02:53] so we find when we're taken out of the
[1:02:56] way total Destruction is coming
[1:03:00] his destruction is coming and so he's
[1:03:03] fighting every day he's fighting you
[1:03:05] he's he's combating you he may come with
[1:03:07] your children or come with your marriage
[1:03:09] or come with your finances or come with
[1:03:11] some form passion or some way but Satan
[1:03:14] is fighting you he doesn't want you to
[1:03:16] reach that place of restoration
[1:03:18] but there's been a word already
[1:03:20] pronounced over a people there's been a
[1:03:22] word already has gone forth over a
[1:03:24] people that I will restore saith the
[1:03:27] Lord there ain't enough devils in Hell
[1:03:29] there ain't enough trials and
[1:03:30] tribulations that you're going to go
[1:03:32] through in life that word has already
[1:03:33] been spoken over you brother it's
[1:03:35] already been spoken over you sister and
[1:03:37] let me just tell you you might as well
[1:03:39] get ready for the changes coming
[1:03:41] [Applause]

[1:03:44] don't like change all y'all realize that
[1:03:47] I'm one of those somebody's that don't
[1:03:48] like change but this change I'm
[1:03:51] embracing this change I'm looking for
[1:03:53] every morning I get up between six and

[1:07:57] there you may be also
[1:08:00] now brother Brown tells us in the
[1:08:01] message Fellowship by Redemption he goes
[1:08:04] I never believed that heaven was a place
[1:08:06] where there's a bunch of buildings
[1:08:09] how many of you believed that back in
[1:08:11] the day
[1:08:12] oh come on just be honest
[1:08:15] don't be so messes theologies that you
[1:08:17] oh y'all never thought that
[1:08:19] in my father's house I'm gonna have me
[1:08:21] imagine I'm gonna tell you it's gonna be
[1:08:23] the biggest mansion on the Block
[1:08:24] hit no
[1:08:26] but he says I never thought or believed
[1:08:29] that heaven was a place where there's a
[1:08:30] bunch of buildings where there's a bunch
[1:08:32] of houses up there made with mortar and
[1:08:35] adopt with paper and paint on the wall
[1:08:37] he goes I'll never believed that that a
[1:08:40] supernatural being would live in a
[1:08:42] literal house
[1:08:44] but I believe when Jesus spoke in John
[1:08:46] 14 in my father's house is many mansions
[1:08:49] he meant a body a Dwelling Place
[1:08:54] oh I just love that
[1:08:56] for the scriptures verify the same thing
[1:08:58] if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:09:00] we have one already waiting
[1:09:04] come on this is time for some of you
[1:09:06] older people say amen
[1:09:09] yes it's okay
[1:09:11] it's all right if time should tarry you
[1:09:14] got a new body waiting on you
[1:09:18] you know the older I get the more this
[1:09:20] becomes a reality
[1:09:22] we're not meant to live forever in these
[1:09:24] bodies
[1:09:25] but I know if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:09:27] beat us off I got a new body waiting on
[1:09:30] me it don't matter how old this body
[1:09:32] gets how beat down this body gets how
[1:09:34] the crap and how it deteriorates I got a
[1:09:37] new body weight what a promise
[1:09:39] oh one one breath outside of this life
[1:09:42] when I take my last breath I'm into a
[1:09:44] new body oh well body a body that'll
[1:09:47] never get sick a body that'll never
[1:09:49] deteriorate a body that'll never perish
[1:09:51] a body that'll never grow old a body
[1:09:53] that'll never weaken Under Pressure I'm
[1:09:55] stepping into a new body a theophany
[1:09:57] body the body that God intended for us
[1:09:59] to live in and that's where you head in
[1:10:01] church
[1:10:02] and God is in the process of restoring a
[1:10:05] bride back to that body
[1:10:10] he says now mortal beings is the only
[1:10:12] one who lives in mortal habitations
[1:10:16] Immortal beings live in in Immortal
[1:10:19] habitations then the place that we go
[1:10:22] into until we return back is not a place
[1:10:24] of brick and mortar and clay and
[1:10:26] precious stones or Jewels it's a place
[1:10:29] of condition
[1:10:30] that we move out of this Dimension that
[1:10:33] we live in into another dimension it's a
[1:10:36] house a tabernacle a Dwelling Place
[1:10:39] see he has gone to prepare a place for
[1:10:42] every believer
[1:10:44] how many are believers this morning
[1:10:47] it should be a hundred percent hands up
[1:10:49] or 200 because you hopefully most of you
[1:10:51] got two hands
[1:10:53] all right he has gone to prepare a place
[1:10:57] for every believer
[1:10:59] that the very moment we step out of
[1:11:01] these mortal regions we don't go out
[1:11:04] into some myth or some Supernatural
[1:11:06] Spirit but we go into a tabernacle a
[1:11:09] dwelling place and that might be right
[1:11:12] here he said and that might be right
[1:11:14] here in this building this morning a
[1:11:16] place that no other radio activity or
[1:11:19] nothing could touch that is solely fixed
[1:11:22] by God Alone
[1:11:24] he said Moses have been dead for 800
[1:11:26] years Elijah had been dead for around
[1:11:28] six or seven hundred years and they
[1:11:30] stood on Mount Transfiguration both of
[1:11:32] them in their mortal looks
[1:11:34] talking to Jesus just before he went to
[1:11:36] Calvary
[1:11:38] so they were in their theophany Immortal
[1:11:41] bodies
[1:11:42] he says now he goes I got a revelation
[1:11:44] the other day standing up there on Mount
[1:11:46] polymer at the observatory and seeing
[1:11:49] time and space over to Mars and to the
[1:11:52] last continents and so forth like
[1:11:54] traveling at so many thousand miles per
[1:11:56] second he said now if an angel started
[1:11:58] from the furthest storm coming here it
[1:12:01] would take billions times billions times
[1:12:03] billions of years to get here
[1:12:06] if he started From Mars and he'd come
[1:12:08] here flying at the speed of light
[1:12:10] space or the light speed it would take
[1:12:12] him billions of years to get here he
[1:12:14] goes now I cannot believe that there is
[1:12:17] a house way out yonder but I believe
[1:12:19] that that house that God was speaking of
[1:12:22] is present right here now
[1:12:25] oh my
[1:12:27] God oh my there's a dimension church
[1:12:29] that we can't see right now
[1:12:31] and the problem would tell us when when
[1:12:33] that Dimension slows down and this one
[1:12:36] speeds up what's going to happen that's
[1:12:38] going to be a transition a transition
[1:12:40] take place
[1:12:41] oh and that that Dimension slows down
[1:12:43] he's always just above your head right
[1:12:45] now it's just a few feet above you
[1:12:47] that's how close we are to the body
[1:12:49] change that's how close we are to a well
[1:12:52] body that's how close we are for living
[1:12:54] in the father's house
[1:12:57] he goes you go millions and millions of
[1:12:59] miles beyond that Dimension you'll get
[1:13:01] into a place that's just as real as
[1:13:03] television pictures here's in the room
[1:13:05] this morning if there's the Lord Jesus
[1:13:07] Christ the resurrected Son of God
[1:13:09] standing here and the reason that you
[1:13:12] can't see him is because your heart
[1:13:13] hasn't become tuned down to it and the
[1:13:17] reason we can't see the television
[1:13:18] pictures we're in our bodies we're not
[1:13:20] instruments to pick up the mechanical
[1:13:22] scent things but when our body becomes
[1:13:25] in tune with God
[1:13:27] but coming apart of him then our soul
[1:13:30] can pick up the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:32] to vindicate the presence of the Lord
[1:13:34] Jesus Christ and all of his power and
[1:13:36] omnipotence he has risen from the dead
[1:13:38] he lives among us today he wants
[1:13:40] Fellowship back with his people again
[1:13:42] his great Majesty his glory is now
[1:13:45] spreading forth he is Desiring
[1:13:47] Fellowship again with his people like he
[1:13:49] did in the Garden of Eden
[1:13:51] so that's why he sent a message was to
[1:13:54] he to restore Fellowship so that we once
[1:13:58] again can be on speak in terms with our
[1:14:00] savior because we understand due to the
[1:14:02] fall and separated Humanity from their
[1:14:05] God and now we fine he goes now I know
[1:14:07] that there is a lamb beyond the river
[1:14:09] there's a region Yonder somewhere that
[1:14:12] the Glorious persons of the great angels
[1:14:14] of God and his beings are fellowshipping
[1:14:17] together
[1:14:18] oh we're headed back to that
[1:14:21] we're headed back tonight I don't know
[1:14:22] what you think about about heaven I
[1:14:24] don't know what you think about these
[1:14:25] things but I'll tell you what we had a
[1:14:27] Prophet come and tell us
[1:14:28] we had a Prophet come and tell us oh let
[1:14:30] me just tell you right he says now I go
[1:14:32] to prepare a place to receive them it
[1:14:35] shows that he was speaking to them and
[1:14:38] see there's a life after this life has
[1:14:40] ended
[1:14:42] there's a life after this life has ended
[1:14:44] and what a consolation that ought to
[1:14:47] give all of us to know that after this
[1:14:49] life is over there is a life
[1:14:54] there is a life
[1:14:58] brother Ross cancer is trying to destroy
[1:15:01] your body there's a life after this one
[1:15:07] of these mornings between six and nine

[1:15:12] that life stepping through the door

[1:15:41] and when they come stepping in all my a
[1:15:44] change will be all what's happening
[1:15:46] while we're being restored back through
[1:15:48] the message God is placed us he's giving
[1:15:51] us something to look forward to in the
[1:15:53] morning

[1:16:49] he says now that becomes more of a
[1:16:50] reality to you so I'm not picking on you

[1:20:51] what a God and it took a profit
[1:20:54] it took a profit to prepare this body
[1:20:57] for restoration
[1:20:59] because if you go to the nominations
[1:21:01] they're not they don't believe this
[1:21:03] there's going to be trains planes and
[1:21:05] Automobiles crashing and people going I

[1:21:45] get there he's going to prepare a place
[1:21:48] for us when we get there it'll all be
[1:21:50] prepared just even like this die he says
[1:21:53] this night is prepared like this hour is

[1:22:24] five days I'm gonna tell you it'll wear

[1:22:30] but I sat so long I got tired of sitting
[1:22:33] I'll walk up them Hills and then mile
[1:22:36] you know you just this body can't handle
[1:22:38] it
[1:22:39] his body wasn't meant to handle it
[1:22:41] oh but when we get in that new body
[1:22:44] man we're going to get to the tallest
[1:22:45] hill on the other side we're going to
[1:22:47] look at look at him we're going to see
[1:22:48] all of eternity he said we made it
[1:22:51] we made it because God restored us back
[1:22:54] God had thoughts of us before the
[1:22:56] foundation of the world and what you are
[1:22:58] now you're only coming into that thought
[1:23:01] you're only being restored back to that
[1:23:03] thought of what God had of you you are
[1:23:05] not what you are now but you're going to
[1:23:06] be there you're going to be in a new
[1:23:08] body a new dwelling place with eternal
[1:23:10] Thoughts with eternal value what Eternal
[1:23:12] promises in an eternal God ruling and
[1:23:15] reigning with an eternal savior that's
[1:23:17] where we're headed Church
[1:23:19] he says I'll go to prepare a place for
[1:23:22] you and take you out of this pest house
[1:23:24] and deliver you into my father's house
[1:23:28] see there you are take you out of this
[1:23:29] old Earthly past house he's gone to
[1:23:32] prepare a place a perfect place where no
[1:23:34] evil exists no sickness exists no old
[1:23:38] age exists and no death exists things
[1:23:41] that are to be
[1:23:43] and the old people in the church says
[1:23:45] hallelujah
[1:23:46] come on old people it's okay if you're
[1:23:49] north of 50 brother Tim that means you
[1:23:51] Hallelujah
[1:23:53] it's okay Hallelujah that's where we're
[1:23:57] headed there'll be no pain there'll be
[1:23:58] no sickness there'll be none of these
[1:24:00] things no he says we're going to a new
[1:24:02] body
[1:24:04] he said it's a perfect place calling you
[1:24:07] to that perfection
[1:24:09] you have to be perfect to get there the
[1:24:11] Bible said Jesus said be you therefore
[1:24:13] perfect even as your father and Heaven
[1:24:15] is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it
[1:24:18] must be a perfect people come
[1:24:21] because you have to stand to be married
[1:24:23] to a perfect Son of God and you must be
[1:24:26] a perfect bride
[1:24:28] and you can't be perfect in your own
[1:24:30] ability
[1:24:32] as much as you try as hard as you try
[1:24:35] oh Church you can't do it on your own
[1:24:38] effort some of you that have been
[1:24:40] struggling with pornography you can't do
[1:24:42] it on your own efforts no you can lay it
[1:24:44] down for so long but if you hadn't been
[1:24:46] changed if your thought hadn't been
[1:24:48] changed and your nature hadn't been
[1:24:49] changed and your desires hadn't been
[1:24:51] changed you're gonna fall back to it but
[1:24:53] we've got a word that's going to restore
[1:24:55] us back so you don't think those old
[1:24:57] thoughts you don't have those old
[1:24:58] actions in those old desires but you
[1:25:00] begin to be renewed in your mind your
[1:25:02] mind begins to be restored your heart
[1:25:04] begins to be restored and the last thing
[1:25:06] that takes place is this body because in
[1:25:09] a full restoration and we step into a
[1:25:11] new body and then there'll be no dirty
[1:25:13] thoughts there'll be no uh evil thinking
[1:25:15] of anything like that you'll be thinking
[1:25:17] God's way in God's thoughts and
[1:25:19] believing God's promised word for that
[1:25:21] hour
[1:25:23] but he says now notice so how we're
[1:25:27] supposed to be perfect
[1:25:28] and brother Derek you can't do it on
[1:25:30] your own it takes a perfect god with the
[1:25:33] perfect message to come and make his
[1:25:35] people perfect
[1:25:37] and that's why we got to surrender our
[1:25:39] rights
[1:25:40] we're Lambs surrender your rights
[1:25:44] to do his will he goes now look it's a
[1:25:47] perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect
[1:25:49] people because you have to stand and be
[1:25:52] married to a perfect Son of God and you
[1:25:55] must be a perfect bride things that are
[1:25:59] to be
[1:26:00] so how can you do it through anything
[1:26:02] else but the perfect word of God which
[1:26:04] is the Waters of Separation that washes
[1:26:07] us from our sins he says that's right
[1:26:09] the blood of Jesus Christ think of it
[1:26:11] dripping bloody word amen the blood the
[1:26:14] word of God bleeding blood to wash the
[1:26:17] bride in
[1:26:19] she stands perfect virgin unadulterated
[1:26:22] she never sinned in the first place amen
[1:26:26] she was trapped into it
[1:26:29] now sometimes we can take this thought
[1:26:31] especially as a young person and think
[1:26:32] well I'm Justified but your desires
[1:26:34] hadn't changed yet
[1:26:36] just because you think well I still
[1:26:38] didn't even like Tabernacle I go to a
[1:26:39] message church and I believe God sent a
[1:26:41] prophet that I'm Justified it takes more
[1:26:43] than that justification means the things
[1:26:46] that you did you don't do them anymore
[1:26:48] you're declared Justified you never done
[1:26:51] it in the first place the old desires
[1:26:53] that you had to do it are no longer
[1:26:54] there you've got a new thinking a new
[1:26:56] mind a whole new nature and a new
[1:26:58] desires
[1:27:00] and he says now she stands perfect
[1:27:03] virgin
[1:27:04] unadulterated she never sinned in the
[1:27:07] first place so what brought us back to
[1:27:09] nomination didn't bring you to that
[1:27:11] place the Baptist Church didn't bring
[1:27:13] you to that thinking the Methodist
[1:27:15] Church didn't bring us to that thinking
[1:27:16] but the messes of the hour brought you
[1:27:18] back to that thinking Troy you realize
[1:27:20] that God's thought that he had of you in
[1:27:22] the beginning now you stand Justified
[1:27:25] now you stand now you stand
[1:27:27] predestinated of God to be back in the
[1:27:30] thoughts of God and these are things
[1:27:32] that are to be
[1:27:33] it's at the end of his roads when the
[1:27:35] last sermons that he preaches and he's
[1:27:37] telling us these are things that are
[1:27:39] coming there's going to be a bride and
[1:27:41] there's going to be a Rapture and all
[1:27:42] these things have to take place that has
[1:27:44] to be restored on this side that we can
[1:27:46] take that body change
[1:27:48] these are things that are to be not
[1:27:50] maybe not should be but these are things
[1:27:53] that will be there's a change coming
[1:27:55] from this body
[1:28:00] he said notice
[1:28:02] in Fellowship by Redemption sin
[1:28:04] separated Adam and Eve they went off in
[1:28:06] sin and and God had only one preparation
[1:28:08] for a sinful man to reach a holy God and
[1:28:11] that wasn't by self-righteousness
[1:28:13] it wasn't about patching up an old thing
[1:28:16] it was by the death and the resurrection
[1:28:18] the only way God condemned the man in
[1:28:21] the Garden of Eden because he had sinned
[1:28:23] in his whole body was full of mire and
[1:28:26] he says and never can you ever turn a
[1:28:29] new page
[1:28:30] you know people you can't turn a new
[1:28:32] page turn a new pages ain't come get the
[1:28:34] job done
[1:28:37] you know I tried turning new pages in my
[1:28:39] early Christian years it doesn't work
[1:28:41] some of you you try turning new pages
[1:28:43] you made decrees I'm not going to do it
[1:28:46] I'm not going to do it I'm not going to
[1:28:47] do it and sure enough because you hadn't
[1:28:49] been changed you did it you fell to it
[1:28:51] that's why we got to have a change and
[1:28:53] that change is only the first step of
[1:28:55] restoration
[1:28:57] God restoring you back and he starts in
[1:29:00] your mind to be renewed in your mind
[1:29:03] notice what he says he goes I don't care
[1:29:05] how much you join Church how many good
[1:29:07] things you do them as all fine you buy
[1:29:10] the Widow coal when she's cold you buy
[1:29:12] her food when she's hungry you take the
[1:29:14] little kids off the street that's good
[1:29:16] nothing to say light of that he goes but
[1:29:18] my brother sister you're a miserable
[1:29:20] being until that old Foundation is swept
[1:29:23] out
[1:29:24] the whole Foundation to swept out and
[1:29:26] you become a new creature in Christ
[1:29:28] Jesus in order for that Soul can be in
[1:29:31] contact with God for Fellowship you see
[1:29:33] he goes then when you get into that
[1:29:35] wonderful glorious Fellowship of his
[1:29:37] being all the little things just pass
[1:29:39] away and it seems all petty so childlike
[1:29:42] that's why we have trouble that's why we
[1:29:45] have professed Christians living just
[1:29:46] today they're all right tomorrow they're
[1:29:48] wrong the next day they're this he says
[1:29:50] it's because they never tore the old
[1:29:52] Foundation down
[1:29:54] Church's time to tear the old Foundation
[1:29:56] down
[1:29:57] it's time to sweep out the house and
[1:29:59] sweep out the foundation he says when he
[1:30:01] had when he had sinned God felt sorry
[1:30:03] for the poor fella see him and Eve going
[1:30:05] away without it going out there in
[1:30:07] Fellowship
[1:30:08] are going out of the fellowship they
[1:30:10] would have to shift for themselves what
[1:30:13] could they do they had a loving father
[1:30:15] who would take care of them but now
[1:30:16] through Disobedience cut off to a
[1:30:18] fellowship no more Fellowship they had
[1:30:20] to make a way for themselves
[1:30:23] they had to till the soul earn the
[1:30:25] living by a sweat of their brow they had
[1:30:27] to get sick and die in all kind of
[1:30:29] troubles and heartaches and
[1:30:30] disappointments why they severed the
[1:30:33] fellowship no more fellowship with God
[1:30:34] it couldn't be but God gave us a message
[1:30:39] I will restore
[1:30:42] Malachi 4 I'm going to restore you back
[1:30:45] to the faith of the fathers and when we
[1:30:47] restore back to that Faith we're stored
[1:30:49] back to the fellowship
[1:30:52] he says now that's where man stands
[1:30:54] today that's the reason you see them on
[1:30:56] the street working on Sunday that's why
[1:30:58] the reason you see them out going
[1:31:00] fishing and hunting on Sunday that's the
[1:31:02] reason you see them out there horse
[1:31:03] racing and automobile racing while you
[1:31:05] see them in the Poo rooms and Dives and
[1:31:07] so forth there is something in a man
[1:31:09] hungering for something that he can't
[1:31:11] find it
[1:31:13] see in this world can't produce it and
[1:31:15] the church can't produce it on mental
[1:31:18] theology they can't do it but a real
[1:31:20] child of God is hungering and thirsting
[1:31:23] why if there's something in your heart
[1:31:25] telling you that you want it and it
[1:31:27] needs in its needs there and he goes it
[1:31:30] just shows there's something pulsating
[1:31:31] trying to pull you there there's a body
[1:31:35] there that this one is a type of here
[1:31:38] he goes what are you using this one for
[1:31:41] to glorify the devil and the world and
[1:31:43] the fascisms and things are you looking
[1:31:45] towards heaven there's something up
[1:31:47] there if you're glorifying god with your
[1:31:49] life so notice why are you here this
[1:31:51] morning because there's something inside
[1:31:53] of you hungering there's something
[1:31:54] inside of you thirsting there's
[1:31:56] something pulling you into a new body
[1:31:59] that's why you're here the pastors away
[1:32:01] but you're here today
[1:32:04] why wasn't that oh you were coming to
[1:32:06] hear brother Joe no you brother Joe has
[1:32:08] nothing to do with it but there's
[1:32:09] something inside of you there's a desire
[1:32:11] inside of you that's pulling you to a
[1:32:13] new body and I'm here to tell you these
[1:32:15] are things that are to be but there's
[1:32:18] going to be a people she's going to be
[1:32:19] that pool is going to be so strong one
[1:32:22] day we're going to be pulled right on
[1:32:23] into it are you gonna step out of this
[1:32:26] old mortal flesh and you're going to
[1:32:27] step into a whole new body a well body
[1:32:30] of the liver body a body that don't
[1:32:32] think ugly thought but a body that
[1:32:33] thinks God thoughts
[1:32:36] then we're going to start traveling like
[1:32:38] a thought
[1:32:40] and that sounds really good right now
[1:32:43] notice but a real kind to God
[1:32:47] he's hungering and thirsting
[1:32:49] he says in my father's house are many
[1:32:51] mansions
[1:32:52] not us for no more
[1:32:55] because there's many mansions brother EJ
[1:32:57] one bald-headed
[1:33:00] about that tall
[1:33:02] kind of a mansion over there
[1:33:04] what was God done in the last three
[1:33:05] years in brother EJ's life restored him
[1:33:09] if I don't feel a very difficult time we
[1:33:11] thought his life was going to fall apart
[1:33:12] but God was processed of restoration
[1:33:15] because God has included brother EJ in
[1:33:18] the change
[1:33:19] and we see so many who has been added to
[1:33:22] the to the body here at the local body
[1:33:23] because one God is bringing a
[1:33:25] restoration
[1:33:28] see he says now in my father's house are
[1:33:31] many mansions if it wasn't so I would
[1:33:32] have told you I'll go to prepare a place
[1:33:34] for you and I come again to receive you
[1:33:36] unto myself that where I am there you
[1:33:39] may be awesome
[1:33:40] things that are to be these things that
[1:33:44] are now are only potential calling for
[1:33:47] the things that are to be
[1:33:49] oh my a real child of God hungering for
[1:33:52] a change
[1:33:53] a real child of God but each passing day
[1:33:55] this Mortal body deteriorates but
[1:33:57] they're longing
[1:33:59] this old Earthly Tabernacle that we have
[1:34:01] is groaning for something different
[1:34:03] it's groaning the Bible Will Tell Us in
[1:34:05] second Corinthians 5 and verse 1 for we
[1:34:08] know that at this Earthly House of this
[1:34:10] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[1:34:12] building of God
[1:34:14] notice a house a Dwelling Place not made
[1:34:18] with hands Eternal in the heavens for in
[1:34:21] this sweet grown earnestly Desiring to
[1:34:24] be clothed upon with our house it's your
[1:34:27] house
[1:34:29] oh my be
[1:34:31] close with your house
[1:34:33] that one that God thought of when God
[1:34:35] thought about having a family brother
[1:34:36] Derek he thought of you
[1:34:38] he thought he was going to be so tall so
[1:34:40] big so this so that nature this way and
[1:34:42] that way when God thought of it God
[1:34:44] thought of you in and yet our bodies are
[1:34:47] groaning to be cold with this house to
[1:34:49] be cold with this Dwelling Place
[1:34:52] see we've grown church and that's why
[1:34:54] we're here in church this morning we're
[1:34:56] groaning to get back into that body
[1:34:58] we're growing to live in the Eternal
[1:35:00] Realms we're groaning to take on a
[1:35:01] theophany body we want to be clothed not
[1:35:04] with somebody else's body not with
[1:35:06] somebody else's talks not with somebody
[1:35:07] else's ideas but code with their own
[1:35:10] theophany body so we can live as God
[1:35:12] wanted us to live from the beginning
[1:35:15] he says so now in verse 3 if so be that
[1:35:18] we're being clothed we shall not be
[1:35:20] found naked
[1:35:22] for we that are in this Tabernacle we do
[1:35:24] grown being burdened not for that which
[1:35:27] we could not be uncloged but clothed
[1:35:29] upon that mortality might be swallowed
[1:35:32] up of life
[1:35:34] see man has to get
[1:35:36] man's got to tear down the old
[1:35:38] Foundation
[1:35:39] man's got to be regenerated and born
[1:35:41] again and come back to God
[1:35:44] and it's a process
[1:35:46] and it's called restoration
[1:35:48] and we're in that process and we're
[1:35:50] being restored we're not turning new
[1:35:52] pages you'll never do it it might be
[1:35:53] good he goes I have nothing against that
[1:35:55] good works that you do but that won't do
[1:35:57] it join the church won't do it taking
[1:35:58] your children to church won't do it
[1:35:59] until it becomes an individual affair
[1:36:03] it's got to be individual
[1:36:05] whether my wife makes it whether she
[1:36:08] doesn't make it it doesn't hinder me I
[1:36:10] have to to have that determination of my
[1:36:12] own
[1:36:14] we it has to be an individual Affair
[1:36:16] until you become back into Fellowship
[1:36:19] then we know we pass from Death unto
[1:36:22] life for our spirit Bears record with
[1:36:24] his spirit that we are Sons and
[1:36:26] Daughters of God and in the message of
[1:36:27] the invisible Union but prophet of God
[1:36:29] will tell us and any son is an attribute
[1:36:31] of his father
[1:36:33] now you look at my son
[1:36:35] good looking at me
[1:36:37] tip off the whole block
[1:36:40] well he's a big chip off a little bitty
[1:36:43] block over here
[1:36:44] tall he's trapping strong good looking
[1:36:48] putting the plug in for you son
[1:36:51] what we find to see any sun is an
[1:36:53] attribute
[1:36:55] of his father
[1:36:56] see there's things that we name and we
[1:36:58] may not look identical there's
[1:37:00] attributes in him that are in me there's
[1:37:03] attributes in my children that are in me
[1:37:06] and some of them are stronger than
[1:37:07] others are more prevalent than others
[1:37:09] but the prophet of God will say any son
[1:37:10] is the attribute of his father just as
[1:37:13] you were in the genes of your father in
[1:37:15] the body of your father when he was a
[1:37:17] young boy you were in him yet you cannot
[1:37:20] have fellowship with him because you
[1:37:22] didn't know him but through the bedding
[1:37:24] grounds of your mother you were brought
[1:37:26] forth into the Earth and becoming the
[1:37:28] image of your father then he could have
[1:37:30] fellowship with you and he says and we
[1:37:33] were and so were you sons of God and
[1:37:35] Daughters of God before there ever was a
[1:37:38] moon stars are molecule you were Sons
[1:37:40] and Daughters of God for you were only
[1:37:42] the physical manifestation of the
[1:37:45] attributes that was in God in the
[1:37:46] beginning
[1:37:48] he says there's only one form of eternal
[1:37:50] life and that was you
[1:37:53] wow there's only one form of eternal
[1:37:57] life and that was you before notice
[1:38:01] before you don't know nothing about it
[1:38:03] neither did you know when you was in
[1:38:05] your Earthly father but you were
[1:38:06] manifested too In His Image in the image
[1:38:09] of God all you made and you were
[1:38:10] manifested for the glory and The
[1:38:12] Fellowship Of God therefore as sure as
[1:38:14] the gene had to be in your father before
[1:38:16] your natural birth your spiritual Dean
[1:38:18] had to be in God because you are an
[1:38:20] expression of the attributes of his
[1:38:22] thoughts before the foundation of the
[1:38:25] world
[1:38:26] and notice we come in corruptable bodies
[1:38:28] but the Bible says we were made in the
[1:38:30] image of God and if God is sinless and
[1:38:35] god is perfect and God is Immortal that
[1:38:38] ensures us that we're going back to that
[1:38:42] see God is not corruptable he's not
[1:38:45] sinful and therefore we must be restored
[1:38:47] back to that kind of life
[1:38:49] but that's why Satan is fighting us so
[1:38:52] hard
[1:38:52] Satan doesn't want you to leave his Eden
[1:38:55] look what he's offered you
[1:38:57] you can have anything you want in
[1:38:59] laodicea you can come to church you can
[1:39:02] stay home and stream and said you had
[1:39:03] church you can whatever you want to do
[1:39:05] you can come in and sit on the Pew in
[1:39:06] the great preaching and never move a
[1:39:08] word never be a participant always just
[1:39:10] sitting there be a spectator but never
[1:39:12] be a participator and I know some of
[1:39:14] that could offends some of you because
[1:39:15] your participal or your Spectators but
[1:39:18] God has designed more out of us than
[1:39:20] just spectating
[1:39:22] God is wanting to restore us back to the
[1:39:25] thoughts that he had in the beginning in
[1:39:27] that restoration job where was you
[1:39:29] Joe where was you when the sons of God
[1:39:32] shouted for Joy they weren't sitting
[1:39:34] there with their head down no but when
[1:39:36] the word was coming forth they were
[1:39:37] shouting and rejoicing over the word of
[1:39:40] God over realizing we've been restored
[1:39:43] back we come down through the fall we
[1:39:45] received the Vindicated word and that
[1:39:47] word changed our thoughts it changed our
[1:39:50] desires and now it's changing our bodies
[1:39:52] we're being restored back to that and
[1:39:54] one of these let me tell you that should
[1:39:55] excite you this morning that that's what
[1:39:57] God has called you to he didn't call you
[1:39:59] to live in laodicea he didn't call you
[1:40:01] to remain down here in the chicken yard
[1:40:03] but God has called you to fire to lift
[1:40:06] those Heavenly Wings and soar into the
[1:40:08] supernatural elements
[1:40:11] that's something to shout about
[1:40:14] well I don't shout stub your toe
[1:40:18] give me a hammer and let me put your
[1:40:20] hand your thumb on and we'll see if you
[1:40:22] shout or not
[1:40:25] I'm not trying to be ugly and be mean to
[1:40:28] be critical but come on God is restoring
[1:40:30] us

[1:40:34] shall Exhilarate you
[1:40:36] well you say brother don't that's your
[1:40:37] message that's how God gave it to you no
[1:40:39] that's your message that's what God is
[1:40:41] given to you I'm only an instrument God
[1:40:43] put the thought in my heart to deliver
[1:40:45] to you this one to tell you you're being

[1:41:02] stand and sing and open up your mouth
[1:41:04] but during the preaching of the word

[1:41:09] man criticized him because he got so
[1:41:11] loud he goes if I didn't know they if
[1:41:13] they didn't do that I wouldn't know they

[1:47:01] I'll talk to you about a restored Church
[1:47:10] oh my
[1:47:12] oh my
[1:47:14] it will speak in tongues I know you need
[1:47:17] a prophet to tell you that those on the
[1:47:19] Stream
[1:47:20] there you have it
[1:47:22] it will speak in tongues
[1:47:24] prophesy and had the power of signs of
[1:47:28] the resurrected Jesus Christ in it why
[1:47:30] because it's thriving
[1:47:32] what are you here for
[1:47:34] cause you're thriving not only improve
[1:47:36] it
[1:47:37] not on Timothy Pruitt not on Aaron
[1:47:40] Oglesby or Joe Evans you're thriving
[1:47:42] notice you're thriving on the natural
[1:47:44] resource of the vine itself
[1:47:47] you're thriving on the life of the Vine
[1:47:52] if all you are is Baptist that's all
[1:47:54] you're ever going to be
[1:47:55] oh my because of your Baptist theology
[1:47:58] is only grafted in to the life that's
[1:48:01] being stirred right here that's why you
[1:48:03] don't stand that's why you don't shout
[1:48:05] that's why you don't Rejoice but you can
[1:48:07] ever get born into that vine and not
[1:48:09] graft it in oh you're a shout you'll
[1:48:12] sing praises your worship a living God
[1:48:14] [Applause]
[1:48:17] he says you see it wasn't grafted into
[1:48:19] the vine it was born in the Vine
[1:48:23] when those other branches were grafted
[1:48:25] he had all they could do was Bear their
[1:48:27] own fruit for what they were born of
[1:48:29] that vine they don't know nothing about
[1:48:31] the original life of the original Fruit
[1:48:36] see they cannot know it for they were
[1:48:38] not born of it but if they had been born
[1:48:40] of it that same life that was in the
[1:48:42] original stem Jesus would come through
[1:48:45] them and manifest through them John 14
[1:48:47] 12 verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:48:49] believeth on me and the works that I do
[1:48:51] shall he do also
[1:48:54] see notice the Masterpiece now at the
[1:48:59] Harvest Time the seed is back to the
[1:49:01] original life
[1:49:03] back to the Bible Malachi 4 said it
[1:49:06] would be brought that way
[1:49:09] oh my church let me go look like a
[1:49:10] little bit further
[1:49:13] see Satan doesn't want you to be
[1:49:15] restored
[1:49:16] for your change
[1:49:19] he likes that critical spirit some of
[1:49:21] you come in with
[1:49:24] what we ain't got all that way my
[1:49:27] goodness could you see us acting that
[1:49:28] way
[1:49:30] what would they think on live stream
[1:49:32] what would they think on YouTube if they
[1:49:33] saw us all acting like brother Joe right
[1:49:35] now
[1:49:36] well they would think one thing were
[1:49:38] free
[1:49:40] but if you've ever been where I've been
[1:49:42] if you ever was hit it where I was
[1:49:43] headed I know that song we may sing it
[1:49:45] up but you don't know like I know what
[1:49:47] he done for me I know where I was hit I
[1:49:50] know where God I know what God had done
[1:49:51] for me I know the voice that came down
[1:49:52] and spoke to me in my car I know it was
[1:49:54] God it wasn't a man I didn't have no man
[1:49:56] to hold my hand lead me to Christ no I
[1:49:58] knew it was God that came down and done
[1:49:59] it I know what he'd done for me that's
[1:50:01] why I worship that's why I have no hope
[1:50:03] it doesn't bother me I don't care what
[1:50:05] you think I don't care what you think I
[1:50:07] don't care what you say I'm not here to
[1:50:09] worship you I'm here to worship God I'm

[1:50:14] him I'll sing with everything I got I'll
[1:50:17] voice it would ever think I got I'll
[1:50:18] praise him with everything I got it
[1:50:20] don't matter cause you don't know I said
[1:50:23] you don't know like I know what it does
[1:50:25] for me all that day he said in the
[1:50:27] street I was headed to see in the
[1:50:29] devil's hell but I got that free person
[1:50:31] every day I was in prison all glory to
[1:50:34] God
[1:50:35] [Applause]
[1:50:38] but now I'm free you don't know like I
[1:50:42] know
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:47] what my God can do it's only it's only
[1:50:51] restoration
[1:50:54] this restoration
[1:50:56] restoration power is in the church this
[1:50:58] morning
[1:51:04] his Saints Can't Stop
[1:51:07] I say the Kingston
[1:51:10] he can't stop your change
[1:51:20] he can't stop
[1:51:23] he can't stop the restoration
[1:51:27] he can't stop the rapture
[1:51:29] he can't stop what he didn't start
[1:51:37] he didn't call you
[1:51:39] Satan didn't cognitive God calls before
[1:51:41] and if God called you God's going to
[1:51:43] finish God's gonna finish God started
[1:51:46] his church the way he wanted it and now
[1:51:49] he's going to have his church the way he
[1:51:50] started it
[1:51:56] notice
[1:51:58] Satan can't stop in Matthew 16. and
[1:52:02] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:52:05] art thou Simon
[1:52:06] son of Jonah
[1:52:08] flesh and blood
[1:52:10] has not revealed this unto thee but my
[1:52:12] father
[1:52:13] but my Father which is in heaven and I
[1:52:16] say unto thee that thou art Peter
[1:52:19] and Upon This Rock This Revelation I'm
[1:52:22] going to build my church and the gates
[1:52:25] of hell can't stop it Satan can't stop
[1:52:28] it cancer can't stop it politics can't
[1:52:31] stop it War can't stop it Seekers can't
[1:52:33] stop I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna have a
[1:52:35] church and she's gonna be without a spot
[1:52:37] and she's going to be without women
[1:52:39] she's going to be when I see it why
[1:52:41] because Satan can't stop but God started
[1:52:49] he says let me tell you something
[1:52:50] brother listen to this and I say this
[1:52:52] respect hallelujah oh hell can't stop it
[1:52:59] all hell can't stop it stop what the
[1:53:02] restoration
[1:53:05] the restoration of what the bride tree
[1:53:09] see God has built his church
[1:53:11] he started his church
[1:53:13] and now he's going to have his church
[1:53:15] the way he planted it in Ephesians
[1:53:19] you may not like the way the church is
[1:53:21] today but if you can only go back to
[1:53:23] Ephesus and see how Paul's church was
[1:53:26] oh brother Orlando they had freedom in
[1:53:28] Paul's Church
[1:53:29] Paul preached one night all night
[1:53:33] somebody felt dead they didn't give up
[1:53:35] they went down to laid hands on them
[1:53:36] brought them back and they finished
[1:53:37] service
[1:53:38] what are you saying brother Joe you're
[1:53:40] going to preach long I don't know
[1:53:44] but I'm here to tell you
[1:53:47] the bride that was in the beginning is
[1:53:49] going to be the same bride today
[1:53:52] we've already been seen in a vision
[1:53:55] think about a pro God let a prophet see
[1:53:57] the bride in preview
[1:54:00] oh when she came in preview she was a
[1:54:02] glorious Church a wonderful church had
[1:54:04] worship my she was she was just a
[1:54:07] beautiful a beautiful article of worship
[1:54:09] of what God's creation and then you see
[1:54:12] what man's Church brought down the
[1:54:14] Church of this in Asia and this one and
[1:54:16] that one and then you see the American
[1:54:17] Church
[1:54:20] so we saw what the church was in Paul's
[1:54:22] day
[1:54:23] then we see what happened in laodicea
[1:54:25] and we see the church that man created
[1:54:27] coming to the tune of rock and roll
[1:54:31] but the spirit of God will say no the
[1:54:34] bride is going to come in preview one
[1:54:35] more time one more time and he said what
[1:54:39] she was in this one is exactly what she
[1:54:42] was in that one
[1:54:43] what was it a restored Church
[1:54:47] same power same word
[1:54:49] same everything
[1:54:51] church that's where we're headed same
[1:54:53] message
[1:54:54] but see the prophet of God said that
[1:54:56] church that bride had to be planted had
[1:54:58] to go into the ground so it could come
[1:55:00] up through the ages and produce what we
[1:55:02] have today just like Christ had to go
[1:55:04] into the ground see hell can't stop a
[1:55:07] cancer can't stop and none of these
[1:55:08] things can stop him he goes we got to
[1:55:10] have a message sweep back and bring the
[1:55:12] people out all these denominational
[1:55:13] conditions back to the original genuine
[1:55:16] Pentecostal faith
[1:55:19] he's going to bring forth a little bride
[1:55:23] this is in the masterpiece
[1:55:26] so that's right that's smitten right
[1:55:27] back to the side of the original word
[1:55:29] and there he is there is the Masterpiece
[1:55:31] the family back together again in the
[1:55:34] Garden of Eden
[1:55:36] the family
[1:55:38] or stores
[1:55:40] though ages separated
[1:55:42] oh but he's going to restore that church
[1:55:44] right back oh my notice what he says now
[1:55:47] God is going to have a virtuous church
[1:55:49] just exactly a bride in Ephesians 5 and
[1:55:53] 27 he's going to present to himself a
[1:55:55] glorious church not having spot wrinkle
[1:55:57] or any such thing but that should be
[1:55:59] holy without blemish and we find that
[1:56:01] word present means to stand by the bring
[1:56:05] near
[1:56:06] he's gonna bring a brand near him
[1:56:09] and not only is she going to be brought
[1:56:10] near but she's going to worship with him
[1:56:11] she's going to rule with him she's going
[1:56:13] to reign with him because why she is
[1:56:15] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she
[1:56:19] is him you talking about A Change of
[1:56:22] Atmosphere

[1:59:42] church in Christ will be the same spirit

[1:59:48] himself God has proved himself to his
[1:59:51] promise in this day Hallelujah the
[1:59:53] headship is here Christ the Risen Lord
[1:59:55] is here in the same power of his
[1:59:58] resurrection that he ever was
[1:59:59] manifesting himself there's the devil's
[2:00:02] answer
[2:00:03] it ain't you fighting this battle by
[2:00:05] yourself the headship is here the
[2:00:07] headship in the body has become one unit
[2:00:11] oh my see the home the husband and wife
[2:00:14] are to be one unit
[2:00:16] kids come to mama mom I want to do this
[2:00:18] now then they run to Daddy
[2:00:21] if Daddy said something different that's
[2:00:23] not one unit
[2:00:24] but when Daddy says I said what's your
[2:00:25] mama say why you always gotta ask what
[2:00:27] mama said
[2:00:28] because we one unit and what mama said
[2:00:31] papa says and when Papa said Mama says
[2:00:34] the headship is here and what the what
[2:00:38] the heck the bride from the head is
[2:00:39] saying so is the pride saying it and
[2:00:42] what does he saying restoration is in in
[2:00:44] the future Church we're going to be
[2:00:46] restored for a change and it may just
[2:00:48] take it the headship is here we had the
[2:00:50] answer to the devil's question he can't
[2:00:52] stop you he can't stop this word he
[2:00:55] can't stop this change he can't stop the
[2:00:57] supernatural he can't stop your healing
[2:00:59] he can't stop your deliverance he can't
[2:01:01] stop us we're an invincible Army we're
[2:01:03] an unruly forced when it comes to hell
[2:01:06] all right
[2:01:09] it's a headship in the body has become
[2:01:10] one unit it's God manifesting in his
[2:01:13] people
[2:01:14] that's the reason the husband and wife
[2:01:15] is no longer Twain but they've come one
[2:01:18] notice
[2:01:19] I'm gonna go just a little bit further
[2:01:21] I know I preached him only an hour last
[2:01:23] time and y'all were all excited for
[2:01:25] those preaching again
[2:01:27] I might keep it a little longer today
[2:01:28] I'm feeling inspired
[2:01:33] notice now he says we stand justified in
[2:01:36] Christ before him because he cannot pass
[2:01:39] judgment he's already judged that body
[2:01:41] in which I'm part of
[2:01:44] oh my
[2:01:45] some of you should have shouted amen
[2:01:47] real loud right there man you know you
[2:01:49] got things in your life and you felt
[2:01:51] crummy all week
[2:01:53] oh but he's already judged that body
[2:01:56] I said he's already judged that body
[2:01:58] he's already declared you perfect
[2:02:01] there you are there's the body of Christ
[2:02:03] Living standing redeemed justified in
[2:02:06] his sight this is Christ and Mr God
[2:02:08] revealed why are we Justified we are his
[2:02:11] victory
[2:02:15] well I don't feel like nobody's Victory
[2:02:17] about Joe you are his victory
[2:02:20] the church is his victory we come forth
[2:02:24] in the last days with this glorious
[2:02:25] gospel showing his victory he died for
[2:02:28] this purpose and we're a proof of his
[2:02:30] victory
[2:02:31] notice now when we see him coming down
[2:02:33] living among the church that's his
[2:02:35] victory shows that he couldn't keep him
[2:02:37] in the grave and he can't keep us in the
[2:02:40] grave while our church is having the

[2:19:28] something sister lauriana if he would
[2:19:30] he says we know that we can only build a
[2:19:32] church first upon the material that God
[2:19:34] gave us to build it with that's all we
[2:19:36] have
[2:19:37] he goes I know this is strong it's going
[2:19:39] to take hundreds of people around the
[2:19:40] world we're here but before we can ever
[2:19:42] have a building of the Church of God we
[2:19:45] will have to restore back all the things
[2:19:46] that these insects has eaten out of
[2:19:49] we'd have to go back and find out what
[2:19:51] the insects eat and before the vine of
[2:19:54] the Lord the Grapevine he's Divine we
[2:19:56] are the branches and before he can ever
[2:19:58] find out or the church can stand in a
[2:20:00] formal in its formal and original Power
[2:20:02] we'll have to go back and find out what
[2:20:04] these insects ain't
[2:20:06] and that church will have to be restored
[2:20:08] back to that or it will never stand in
[2:20:11] the power and Glory
[2:20:13] of its first standing if the bark is
[2:20:16] tore off the tree we got to get back to
[2:20:17] the bark again on it
[2:20:19] grow back to Bart first you can't have
[2:20:21] apples till you grow the Bark for the
[2:20:23] bark is the sap line the sap is in the
[2:20:25] life of the line the scripture is the
[2:20:27] holy he said God's holy Bible is the
[2:20:29] lifeline of the church how could we ever
[2:20:31] bring in a great sap through a
[2:20:32] sycamore's bark you just won't work we
[2:20:35] got to have Grapevine bark
[2:20:37] we've got to have the original bark
[2:20:39] there's only one way that that bar can
[2:20:41] ever come back on the vine that's when
[2:20:43] God grows it himself
[2:20:44] we can't make some put on won't work he
[2:20:48] said it won't work no man's scheme will
[2:20:49] ever work it'll take God's way or it'll
[2:20:51] never live man-made schemes will not
[2:20:53] work he might wrap a rag around the tree
[2:20:55] and say Let It Grow the rag wasn't God's
[2:20:57] program it's got a bark on a Lifeline
[2:20:59] when it comes from the roots it'll
[2:21:02] produce the same life that was in the
[2:21:04] tree
[2:21:06] he says I will
[2:21:09] no wonder one will say oh this and know
[2:21:12] that and disagree no wonder there's isms
[2:21:14] among us see the lifeline has been cut
[2:21:15] off but he says I'm going to restore
