[58:43] it in jesus name and the church said
[58:46] amen you love the lord this morning
[58:49] amen
[58:50] certainly counted an honor to be here
[58:52] today i certainly didn't know i was
[58:54] preaching but uh here we are and and so
[58:57] god knew that
[58:59] brother ron texted me this morning he
[59:01] said it was an ordained moment of god
[59:03] you just didn't know it
[59:06] and i said okay thank you
[59:10] amen certainly to be here and uh glad to
[59:12] be here and be with brother timothy and
[59:14] brother tim and part of the
[59:17] watch the couple get married and and
[59:19] just pray god's blessing be upon them
[59:22] know her ever since she was a little
[59:24] girl and she grew up into a young lady
[59:26] and and you know what but that's the way
[59:28] the church has done
[59:30] the church was young at one time it was
[59:33] immature at one time and brother branham
[59:35] said i believe it was in 1963 it was an
[59:37] infant bride but if we ain't matured
[59:40] since 1963 we're in trouble
[59:42] but i declare today that the bride is a
[59:44] mature lady she's standing on her feet
[59:47] she knows who she is
[59:49] [Applause]
[59:50] amen so we better read before i preach
[59:55] amen just thankful that the presence of
[59:57] the lord is here today
[59:58] galatians chapter 2 in verse 20.
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:08] galatians 2 and 20.
[1:00:11] paul's speaking he said i am crucified
[1:00:14] with christ
[1:00:16] nevertheless i live
[1:00:18] yet not i
[1:00:20] but christ liveth
[1:00:22] in me
[1:00:24] and the life which i now live in the
[1:00:26] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[1:00:28] god
[1:00:29] who loved me and gave himself
[1:00:32] for me
[1:00:33] may god at his blessing today you may be
[1:00:36] seated
[1:00:40] if i could today i'd like to speak for a
[1:00:42] few moments on
[1:00:43] uh
[1:00:44] we have
[1:00:46] the devil's answer
[1:00:48] [Applause]
[1:00:49] and apostle paul here says the life that
[1:00:51] i now live so paul's telling us that he
[1:00:54] lived a different life at one time
[1:00:56] but now he said it's not me that liveth
[1:00:59] but it's christ who liveth in me
[1:01:03] and actually that is an identification
[1:01:05] of the token in your life
[1:01:07] is when it's christ living in you that's
[1:01:09] what god requires for us to have in this
[1:01:12] day is the token to be applied and when
[1:01:14] the tokens apply listen it actually if
[1:01:17] we could actually get it in our minds
[1:01:19] this morning we can't hardly express it
[1:01:20] with words but if we could get it into
[1:01:23] our soul this morning and not just our
[1:01:25] ears we could see the guarantee of it
[1:01:28] that it is our guarantee and it would
[1:01:31] actually cause the church to relax
[1:01:34] not get lacks but to relax in the
[1:01:38] presence of god knowing that god has
[1:01:40] everything in control
[1:01:44] for we are personally identified in the
[1:01:46] headship with him
[1:01:48] huh and brother brown said we have the
[1:01:51] devil's answer to his question
[1:01:54] [Applause]
[1:01:56] amen christ is risen
[1:01:58] he paid the price abraham
[1:02:01] and he's raising up the body he said no
[1:02:04] he's not raising up the body he's
[1:02:05] already raised up his body
[1:02:08] the literal body but he's raising up
[1:02:10] this body
[1:02:12] this body is going to be a manifestation
[1:02:15] of the word of god this body will be an
[1:02:17] acts 2 church
[1:02:21] the devil can't stand it
[1:02:23] the devil can't stand revelation
[1:02:26] he can't stand it brother said that's
[1:02:28] what he's howling about
[1:02:30] that's why he's got all of his
[1:02:31] wickedness going
[1:02:33] look at that look at the condition of
[1:02:34] the world today wickedness on every hand
[1:02:37] wickedness all around us but let me tell
[1:02:40] you god's got a body he's raising up
[1:02:44] he's raising up a body in this hour that
[1:02:46] will walk and talk and be a
[1:02:49] manifestation of the revealed word of
[1:02:51] the hour
[1:03:02] i can't fight with a codom
[1:03:07] amen that's what his scheme is all about
[1:03:09] today
[1:03:10] but his scheme has been revealed in this
[1:03:13] hour
[1:03:14] listen apostle paul i believe it was
[1:03:16] said we are not ignorant of satan's
[1:03:18] devices it has been revealed in this
[1:03:20] hour we know what the devil's up to
[1:03:24] and we have the answer for the devil
[1:03:27] listen he's trying to
[1:03:29] track this one and side track that one
[1:03:31] and cause this one to be afflicted in
[1:03:33] her body
[1:03:36] well tim i was just thinking of brother
[1:03:37] ron while ago right before you prayed
[1:03:38] for him
[1:03:40] we got the devil's answer
[1:03:44] well tim said we're looking for the key
[1:03:46] we got the answer we're just waiting for
[1:03:48] god to get it
[1:03:50] listen it's already in his word
[1:03:52] we just need an inspiration to strike
[1:03:55] somebody
[1:03:57] listen we need inspiration to strike our
[1:03:59] homes we need inspiration to strike our
[1:04:02] families
[1:04:03] we need inspiration to strike our
[1:04:05] personal lives
[1:04:06] [Applause]
[1:04:10] get the revelation it's not you that's
[1:04:12] doing the living
[1:04:14] but it's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:04:18] lord god let me get myself out of the
[1:04:20] way let me realize the headship has come
[1:04:22] down
[1:04:26] two have been made one
[1:04:30] huh
[1:04:31] you're supposed to be one with him
[1:04:34] we've seen that happen yesterday
[1:04:36] in a wedding but we have been married to
[1:04:39] christ the word
[1:04:41] we have already been espoused to him
[1:04:43] listen church we're not going to the to
[1:04:45] the marriage he said we're going to the
[1:04:48] wedding supper we are married right here
[1:04:51] to the word and if you can't be married
[1:04:54] to the word here how are you ever going
[1:04:56] to be an expression of him
[1:04:58] [Applause]
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:02] why is the expression of the husband
[1:05:05] the husband would even be an expression
[1:05:07] of the wife if we could say it that way
[1:05:09] he's reflecting her she's a reflection
[1:05:12] of him he's a reflector of christ
[1:05:16] and a man is known
[1:05:18] the one here but the man is known
[1:05:21] by the wife he chooses
[1:05:27] that's why god chose you
[1:05:30] because he's known by whom he chooses
[1:05:33] he chooses mighty men of valor he
[1:05:36] chooses mighty gentile wires
[1:05:40] he didn't choose some little pansy down
[1:05:42] here that was afraid of a fight but he
[1:05:45] chose somebody who's been ordained in
[1:05:47] this hour to tear down satan's kingdom
[1:05:56] somebody's going to rise to the occasion
[1:06:00] somebody's going to be victorious
[1:06:04] might as well be you
[1:06:07] hallelujah that's not me that's living
[1:06:14] to you that live within me
[1:06:17] we got his answer
[1:06:20] it's not my idea
[1:06:22] it's his power
[1:06:24] it's not some emotion we love emotion
[1:06:27] but it's his word stimulating
[1:06:31] i us people say well they're just too
[1:06:33] emotional getting people all worked up
[1:06:39] go ahead
[1:06:40] well pray tell me what a ball game does
[1:06:46] what do you think they were doing in
[1:06:47] atlanta last night
[1:06:50] don't all y'all act so perfect like you
[1:06:52] didn't
[1:06:53] see part of that last night i know some
[1:06:54] of you did
[1:06:57] it was on in the lobby of the motel
[1:06:58] wasn't it brother
[1:07:03] everybody's going
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:08] we've come to the house of god this
[1:07:09] morning to raise war
[1:07:11] huh you want to talk about a child we're
[1:07:14] going to give the devil the word this
[1:07:16] morning by his stripes we are already
[1:07:19] healed
[1:07:20] the devil has nothing on this bride
[1:07:24] we have his answer
[1:07:30] blue devil
[1:07:31] [Applause]
[1:07:33] what god bless brahman said what god in
[1:07:35] christ manifested
[1:07:37] he gave that flesh and that blood
[1:07:41] that in the blood might come to life yes
[1:07:45] and the flesh be redeemed
[1:07:47] that god
[1:07:48] in this redeemed flesh
[1:07:52] could manifest his
[1:07:54] word for the day as he did in that day
[1:08:00] so god wants to take your redeemed flesh
[1:08:04] and manifest his word as he did when
[1:08:07] jesus walked the swords of galilee
[1:08:10] glory
[1:08:12] don't you see where that places you at
[1:08:14] with god
[1:08:15] it places you in a standing with him
[1:08:17] that you are now
[1:08:20] justified
[1:08:22] amen you never did it in the first place
[1:08:26] and if you're justified he can't even
[1:08:28] judge you
[1:08:29] he already judged you in that body
[1:08:32] that was already judged
[1:08:34] glory to god
[1:08:36] just like you take a drop of ink and you
[1:08:38] put it into a bucket of bleach
[1:08:42] glory
[1:08:43] you don't find it anymore
[1:08:45] it goes back to where it came from
[1:08:50] and when your sins because we were all
[1:08:53] born in sin shaped in a nickel
[1:08:55] we all needed a savior
[1:08:57] you might have been born part of this
[1:08:59] church you might have cut your teeth on
[1:09:01] the pew so to speak here in this church
[1:09:03] but you still needed a savior
[1:09:07] you had to be burned again of the spirit
[1:09:10] of god
[1:09:14] and once you take that and you ask god
[1:09:15] to forgive you he puts it in the sea of
[1:09:17] his forgetfulness
[1:09:19] and it goes back
[1:09:22] on the head
[1:09:24] of the enemy
[1:09:27] hallelujah and when a man is truly
[1:09:29] redeemed and he's a predestinated seed
[1:09:32] and he sees it and he accepts it his
[1:09:34] sins are demolished
[1:09:37] nothing else can be held against him
[1:09:41] god completely
[1:09:42] forgets his sin
[1:09:47] glory to god
[1:09:49] and now
[1:09:50] we are sons and daughters of god
[1:09:53] amen well justin i'll be a son or
[1:09:55] daughter of god someday when i receive
[1:09:57] my adoption
[1:09:59] i already received it
[1:10:02] i'm just waiting on the fullness to take
[1:10:04] place until these bodies are changed

[1:10:11] to be a son of god i am a son of god
[1:10:17] [Music]

[1:12:43] you catch that he's in the same power of
[1:12:46] his resurrection that he ever was
[1:12:51] manifesting himself
[1:12:53] that's the devil's answer
[1:12:57] he's hearing the same power
[1:12:59] manifesting himself that he ever was
[1:13:03] that's the devil's answer
[1:13:07] oh is he manifesting himself in brother
[1:13:09] tim
[1:13:10] yeah but not only
[1:13:14] with an aaron yeah but not only brother
[1:13:15] joe yeah but not only
[1:13:22] you
[1:13:23] you can walk up to the devil
[1:13:26] you got the authority to tell the devil
[1:13:28] to leave
[1:13:29] it ain't just a preacher that's got the
[1:13:31] authority but any blood pump baptized
[1:13:34] seed of god has the authority brother
[1:13:38] to tell the devil to leave
[1:13:45] he comes to you in the middle of the
[1:13:46] night
[1:13:48] please
[1:13:51] amen when you can't get brother tim on
[1:13:52] the phone you can't get timothy you
[1:13:55] can't get these other brothers
[1:13:57] you gotta speak
[1:14:02] [Applause]
[1:14:05] i'll take you out in your sleep
[1:14:08] you can't have me

[1:14:18] only if god allows it
[1:14:21] amen
[1:14:23] i'm here to manifest one
[1:14:26] that's jesus christ i'm not here to
[1:14:28] manifest me
[1:14:30] i ain't got any power
[1:14:32] brother i'm saying i ain't got it he
[1:14:33] said the policeman hadn't got any power
[1:14:35] he just got authority
[1:14:37] i don't have any power on my own but i
[1:14:39] believe we have the authority this
[1:14:41] morning by the word of god and the
[1:14:43] spirit he's revealed in this hour we
[1:14:46] have the devil's answer
[1:14:48] [Applause]
[1:14:52] that's why brother branham when brother
[1:14:53] wade dropped dead
[1:14:57] could say life
[1:14:59] come back
[1:15:02] that's why when a baby been dead for 15
[1:15:05] hours
[1:15:07] in
[1:15:08] mexico
[1:15:10] that's why i don't really matter the
[1:15:12] condition right now so much
[1:15:14] of that little nine-year-old girl
[1:15:16] oh it hurts it hurts the family
[1:15:19] terribly but in the eyes of god
[1:15:23] she could be going 15 hours
[1:15:26] she's brain dead already i don't know
[1:15:28] how many hours but i'm here to tell you
[1:15:30] there is a man that can turn the light
[1:15:32] on this morning and bring life back in
[1:15:35] that body
[1:15:39] the handship is here
[1:15:42] it's not us doing it
[1:15:50] that's the reason the little sister here
[1:15:54] i'm looking for
[1:15:56] i talked to her yesterday
[1:15:58] i can't find there she is
[1:16:01] that hair
[1:16:04] huh
[1:16:05] i remember the youth camp brother tim i
[1:16:06] stand at the front of the line with you
[1:16:08] brothers and she brought those little
[1:16:09] hair pins in her hand
[1:16:12] she said i want to wear these again
[1:16:15] not i want to i'm going to wear this
[1:16:17] again
[1:16:18] she had a positive testimony
[1:16:21] listen
[1:16:22] stand up just a minute sister if you
[1:16:24] don't mind
[1:16:25] i walked you walked by me and i seen
[1:16:27] that long hair
[1:16:29] and just a few years ago there was no
[1:16:31] air
[1:16:32] that's because you can be seated but
[1:16:33] that's because the life is in the body
[1:16:36] now
[1:16:37] hallelujah he's manifesting himself in
[1:16:41] his body now that's why we could pray
[1:16:44] the brothers could pray and hair would
[1:16:46] be restored it was her glory
[1:16:51] that's the reason sister elena butts
[1:16:53] could be sitting up there and jump down
[1:16:55] and run around the church and be healed
[1:16:57] of stage four lung cancer
[1:16:59] [Applause]
[1:17:03] that's the reason we had a brother
[1:17:04] sitting in our church a couple years ago
[1:17:06] and he's sitting over there on the side
[1:17:07] playing a guitar
[1:17:08] he was on two thousand
[1:17:10] this is gonna sound insane
[1:17:12] two thousand
[1:17:14] milligrams of oxycontin
[1:17:17] a day
[1:17:19] he could not put his clothes on in the
[1:17:20] morning
[1:17:23] he had nine back surgeries
[1:17:28] he couldn't hardly move
[1:17:30] and he was sitting over there and
[1:17:31] brother jewelform he was preaching he
[1:17:33] was down here praying for somebody and i
[1:17:34] just walked down the platform and i just
[1:17:35] glanced over at him never had a thought
[1:17:37] in my mind about him condition or
[1:17:39] nothing
[1:17:40] he said brother jason when you looked at
[1:17:42] me something spoke in my heart
[1:17:45] it's over
[1:17:48] now his doctor done told him you quit 2
[1:17:50] 000 milligrams of oxycodone a day you'll
[1:17:52] be a dead man
[1:17:54] he went home he told his wife he said
[1:17:56] it's over she goes what's over he said
[1:17:57] i'm healed
[1:17:59] she said what are you talking about i
[1:18:00] said i'm not taking no more of that
[1:18:01] medicine she said the doctor said you're
[1:18:03] going to die but god said i'm healed
[1:18:06] listen it was in the body
[1:18:09] he quitted cold turkey
[1:18:12] hallelujah that's been several years ago
[1:18:15] that's the reason these things can
[1:18:17] happen among us
[1:18:19] that's the reason god is among us
[1:18:22] [Applause]
[1:18:28] that's the reason regardless what your
[1:18:30] need is
[1:18:35] it can be done today
[1:18:39] i claim what you pray for me won't go
[1:18:41] with him today
[1:18:43] i clean allergies be gone today i claim
[1:18:46] that an autoimmune thing begone today
[1:18:50] listen i claim it in the name of jesus
[1:18:52] how do come you claim it brother jason
[1:18:54] it's my god-given right
[1:18:57] it's my inheritance
[1:19:01] well healing's just for a temporary
[1:19:03] thing i know but it's still the
[1:19:05] children's brand
[1:19:15] glowy
[1:19:23] i just feel to tell something here
[1:19:29] we were all sitting around at brother
[1:19:30] tim's house when
[1:19:33] sister karen had went on to be with the
[1:19:35] lord and we were visiting
[1:19:38] something supernatural began to happen
[1:19:40] in the
[1:19:41] room where the ministers were settling
[1:19:44] i was sitting next to brother jeff
[1:19:48] and brother ron was telling the
[1:19:49] supernatural happening that it happened
[1:19:51] over there
[1:19:53] and it had to do even with
[1:19:55] sister esther and
[1:19:56] and with
[1:19:58] the greater esther you probably know the
[1:20:00] story
[1:20:01] and i was sitting there and something
[1:20:03] rose up in me
[1:20:06] and to be honest i got a little nervous
[1:20:07] and scared really
[1:20:09] i didn't know what to do
[1:20:10] but i felt the speaking tongues but i
[1:20:13] just held it
[1:20:15] and then i got to feeling terrible
[1:20:18] so i text timothy and i told him and i
[1:20:22] and i i told him what i thought it was
[1:20:24] and i just he said i believe he'll go
[1:20:26] back over and start talking brother jeff
[1:20:27] again it'll come back
[1:20:30] and i brother ron went to lay down so i
[1:20:32] just dropped him a message just to be
[1:20:33] praying for me because
[1:20:35] i felt that i greet the lord
[1:20:40] and god is my witness
[1:20:43] i went back over there and i sat back
[1:20:44] down my brother jeff again and finally
[1:20:46] the conversation come up and i began
[1:20:47] talking to him i said brother jeff
[1:20:52] how's your job going you know just
[1:20:54] trying to make a conversation well i
[1:20:56] don't work or i used to god made it away
[1:20:57] where i can be in church all the time
[1:20:59] and
[1:21:00] i said you know god will honor that
[1:21:03] god honor me even if he made less money
[1:21:06] god blessed him but even if he made less
[1:21:08] money you'll put god first god will
[1:21:10] honor that
[1:21:12] amen and i said god will honor that and
[1:21:14] then it just kind of hit me and i just
[1:21:16] began speaking to it i said you know
[1:21:20] i don't know maybe i'm trusting god
[1:21:22] still here against sister as for another
[1:21:25] child
[1:21:26] she lost the child
[1:21:29] i said but you know brother branham told
[1:21:30] us about that
[1:21:34] i said and sister karen is went on
[1:21:37] but i said i have no doubt when sister
[1:21:39] karen walked up to the gates
[1:21:43] that there was a little girl boy
[1:21:45] whichever it was greeted her with little
[1:21:48] anymore about 21 years old come up and
[1:21:51] greeted her and said i hello mavi
[1:21:55] and sister karen said who are you
[1:21:58] i'm jeff and hester's little girl
[1:22:03] there was a spirit dropped down in that
[1:22:05] house
[1:22:07] i'm here to tell you today saints god
[1:22:10] don't miss it when god speaks it
[1:22:12] god's word will be performed
[1:22:16] [Applause]
[1:22:18] don't think brother ron didn't have some
[1:22:20] tormenting nights
[1:22:22] don't think sister esther and brother
[1:22:24] just steal the devil still don't tell
[1:22:25] them
[1:22:26] god's not going to give you a child
[1:22:29] let me just tell you something we are
[1:22:31] here in this day and in this hour to be
[1:22:33] ambassadors of jesus christ we are
[1:22:36] representatives of the king of kings and
[1:22:38] the lord of lords and these things can
[1:22:40] still happen
[1:22:42] because the headship is here
[1:22:48] i know they have one on the other side
[1:22:51] but we're looking for one on this side
[1:22:53] [Applause]
[1:22:56] timothy texted me said you don't know
[1:22:57] what just happened
[1:22:59] there's two or three others in the
[1:23:00] family that had miscarriages too
[1:23:03] just imagine the reunion took place
[1:23:07] they got to see their grandma
[1:23:10] but at that point it became their their
[1:23:13] it became a sister to them
[1:23:15] in a way if we could say it like that
[1:23:17] but they still yet knew it chefs are
[1:23:20] brothers and how's all that happening
[1:23:21] sharon rose new brother bradham
[1:23:24] and she said hello daddy
[1:23:27] don't tell me he's not the same
[1:23:29] yesterday that damn forever
[1:23:32] i declare to you today that same lord
[1:23:35] jesus is able today to rise up the dead
[1:23:38] he's able to heal bodies he's able to do
[1:23:40] anything he wants to do because the
[1:23:42] headship and the body has become one
[1:23:46] unit
[1:23:50] and that's why
[1:23:51] sometimes we open our mouths and words
[1:23:53] come out
[1:23:55] and we don't understand what we just
[1:23:56] spoke
[1:23:57] right
[1:23:59] but god knows
[1:24:02] but it's by inspiration that we speak
[1:24:06] and brother adam said you speak it by
[1:24:08] inspiration it's the same as deity
[1:24:12] speaking
[1:24:14] so god in his church is one
[1:24:17] christ in you it's god's great
[1:24:18] revelation
[1:24:22] we're even bearing his name
[1:24:25] his name is jesus
[1:24:27] the name above all names
[1:24:29] the anointed one the prince of peace the
[1:24:32] mighty god the everlasting father
[1:24:35] but i tell you today it's anointed a
[1:24:38] body in this day and it's proving it's
[1:24:41] manifesting god like that body did
[1:24:45] listen church and that body redeemed
[1:24:47] every one of these bodies
[1:24:50] it's risen it's paid the price
[1:24:52] and he said we're redeemed
[1:24:55] or the fruit redeemed let's start acting
[1:24:57] like we're redeemed
[1:25:00] let's relax in it
[1:25:03] he's already done it
[1:25:06] huh
[1:25:06] see the cares of later we see a cloud
[1:25:08] our eyes
[1:25:13] god gave you that desire that was
[1:25:14] prophesied of you
[1:25:16] and your wife
[1:25:19] sister candace
[1:25:22] huh
[1:25:24] god's still in the healing business
[1:25:27] we got the devil's answer he can't stand
[1:25:29] it we have caught the revelation of the
[1:25:30] last end time hour and it's not just god
[1:25:32] sent a prophet that's part of it we
[1:25:34] believe that but the prophet brought us
[1:25:36] a message
[1:25:38] he brought us something to become
[1:25:42] listen church he can't judge me for i've
[1:25:44] already been judged and if you abide in
[1:25:46] me and my words abide in you ask what
[1:25:50] you will
[1:25:54] and it shall be done
[1:25:59] there's a body of christ standing on
[1:26:00] earth today and alive
[1:26:02] that is redeemed
[1:26:04] that's not afraid to proclaim
[1:26:07] he still heals he still brings the
[1:26:09] backsliders in he still restores the
[1:26:11] loss
[1:26:13] brothers my children are all wayward and
[1:26:15] they're all out in sin commit unto god
[1:26:18] and the prophet of god said the same
[1:26:20] faith that saved you yes sir
[1:26:24] you know the rest of the quote
[1:26:26] save your children
[1:26:29] so this morning we can stand justified
[1:26:31] in his sight because
[1:26:33] we are his
[1:26:34] victory we come forth in the last day of
[1:26:37] his glorious gospel proclaiming it his
[1:26:40] victory
[1:26:42] he died for the purpose that we could be
[1:26:45] proof of his victory
[1:26:47] and when we see him coming down in this
[1:26:49] hour
[1:26:51] we're not talking about 1960s we
[1:26:53] appreciated that
[1:26:56] brother tim was there in the meetings he
[1:26:57] took us by life tabernacle this week a
[1:26:59] lot of supernatural things happen in
[1:27:01] that
[1:27:02] tabernacle but we're looking for
[1:27:04] supernatural things that happen in these
[1:27:06] tabernacles
[1:27:08] we're not just looking for a tabernacle
[1:27:10] made by hats we're looking for something
[1:27:11] to happen here
[1:27:13] lord we need you to come this morning
[1:27:15] and god you begin to live among your
[1:27:16] church when he's living among his church
[1:27:19] that is his victory
[1:27:21] [Applause]
[1:27:25] bro just sometimes i don't feel like i
[1:27:26] have the devil's answer
[1:27:28] you got it
[1:27:29] if you just know how to use it huh it's
[1:27:32] here
[1:27:33] the answer's here

[1:27:37] in the grave
[1:27:39] and if it can't keep jesus in the grave

[1:27:43] keep sister karen in the grave it won't
[1:27:45] keep my mom and daddy in the grave but

[1:30:01] hey i like all these preachers
[1:30:04] but they're not my favorite
[1:30:08] i love them i love to hear brother tim i
[1:30:10] love to hear him two hours

[1:30:22] i love to hear the depth of the word
[1:30:25] but i love to hear i love to hear any
[1:30:27] anointed man of god preach
[1:30:30] but let me tell you the most thing i'm
[1:30:32] looking forward to is not to wake up in
[1:30:34] the morning and hear one of them preach
[1:30:36] i'm looking to wake up in the morning
[1:30:38] and hear come up heather
[1:30:41] i'm waiting to hear the call
[1:30:44] i'm hearing it now
[1:30:46] through the word but i'm waiting for my
[1:30:49] body change
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:53] brother aaron i'm waiting to where i
[1:30:54] wake up one morning my shoulder don't
[1:30:56] hurt anymore
[1:30:57] these gray hairs and all the
[1:30:59] my bald spot brother tim
[1:31:06] it's coming back
[1:31:09] my wife said honey you're getting thin
[1:31:10] on top i said i ain't lost a one
[1:31:17] there's one thing you got to make sure
[1:31:19] that you're calling an election amen
[1:31:22] make sure you're born again
[1:31:24] listen george don't just don't just
[1:31:26] don't maybe think you're born again
[1:31:29] well just and i think i have the holy
[1:31:31] ghost we're living in an hour where it's
[1:31:33] not a time for thinking you have the
[1:31:34] holy ghost you need to know you have the
[1:31:36] holy ghost you need to know you're
[1:31:38] sealed by the power of
[1:31:42] god it couldn't keep jesus in the grave
[1:31:45] it'll not keep us in the grave because
[1:31:47] we're already potentially raised in
[1:31:49] christ
[1:31:51] how because we we're separated from
[1:31:53] unbelief
[1:31:56] to the eternal word of god
[1:31:58] which is
[1:31:59] him
[1:32:02] listen to what brother rham says
[1:32:05] excuse me christ is the mystery he says
[1:32:08] the church is the blood of christ
[1:32:10] by the spirit because the life
[1:32:13] is in the blood
[1:32:15] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:32:18] that baptizes us into the body that
[1:32:20] recognizes only his body
[1:32:24] his word
[1:32:27] denominations are never touched
[1:32:30] message isms will never touch it
[1:32:33] false doctrines are never touching
[1:32:36] tapes only will never touch
[1:32:38] it two souls will never touch it
[1:32:42] seven thunders are never touching we're
[1:32:44] already in the millennium i never touch
[1:32:46] it i i'm telling you i told the church
[1:32:47] so if we're already in the millennium
[1:32:49] i'm disappointed
[1:32:51] but i'm here to tell you this morning my
[1:32:53] soul is at rest but my body is still
[1:32:56] growing
[1:32:58] so i'm waiting for that great millennial
[1:33:01] day
[1:33:03] [Applause]
[1:33:04] so all your false doctrines will never
[1:33:06] touch it
[1:33:08] only the pure
[1:33:10] word of god
[1:33:11] been brought to you
[1:33:13] by a seventh angel message
[1:33:15] a messenger from god sends down a
[1:33:18] revealed word puts it into the hands of
[1:33:20] his men
[1:33:24] huh
[1:33:26] denominations of fail
[1:33:29] never touch it he said because it's a
[1:33:31] revelation
[1:33:33] it must be spiritually
[1:33:35] revealed
[1:33:37] listen if it was ever spiritually
[1:33:38] revealed we wouldn't had all those
[1:33:40] people left there and believe the sign
[1:33:43] but it never was a revelation to them
[1:33:46] most of them actually felt like brother
[1:33:47] branham was god
[1:33:50] because when they realized he wasn't
[1:33:52] they fell
[1:33:54] when they realized he was still yet a
[1:33:55] man and a man could say things wrong he
[1:33:58] could accidentally misspeak he could
[1:34:00] maybe even exaggerate
[1:34:02] what he said
[1:34:06] but when it came to the word
[1:34:10] when it came to the revealed word
[1:34:14] there is no man
[1:34:16] that would stand against him in that day
[1:34:18] amen and the only reason they rise up
[1:34:21] today is because he ain't here
[1:34:24] and most of them won't even stand up to
[1:34:26] a god-called man today they go behind
[1:34:28] behind a keyboard
[1:34:30] somewhere hope someone's watching this
[1:34:33] morning
[1:34:36] listen we've got your answer
[1:34:40] you missed the revelation of the hour
[1:34:42] you thought the revelation was god's and
[1:34:44] a prophet but you missed the prophecy
[1:34:48] it's part of it but you didn't have a
[1:34:51] complete revelation
[1:34:53] so you missed the devil's answer
[1:35:02] you missed the revelation
[1:35:05] but this there wasn't eve before
[1:35:07] that failed
[1:35:11] huh she knowed it
[1:35:13] she knew it but she failed
[1:35:16] and this one knows it and she won't fall
[1:35:20] what a prophecy brother tim this eve
[1:35:23] won't fall how come she won't fall she's
[1:35:26] predestinated not to fall
[1:35:28] she cannot fall she must manifest the
[1:35:31] word of the hour
[1:35:33] blessed is the man whom god did not
[1:35:35] impute sin to
[1:35:40] projection that's just the preachers and
[1:35:41] the prophets
[1:35:42] that's his people
[1:35:46] i've heard ministers take you know and
[1:35:48] use the word of god and use the
[1:35:49] scripture and say touch not mine i don't
[1:35:50] want to do my prophets no harm
[1:35:52] amen
[1:35:53] but then a prophet of god comes along on
[1:35:55] the scene and he goes but you
[1:35:58] are the anointed people
[1:36:00] so it's not just a preacher
[1:36:03] it's the people listen i know better
[1:36:06] than you are matter of fact i'm a
[1:36:07] servant
[1:36:10] listen but here's the thing we are all
[1:36:12] in this together
[1:36:14] there's no big eyes there's no little
[1:36:17] use we are all children of god we are
[1:36:20] all bought by the same price
[1:36:23] some may have a gift another one don't
[1:36:25] that don't make you anything but more
[1:36:27] responsible
[1:36:33] and as god was in christ
[1:36:36] christ is in you what god did in christ
[1:36:39] christ does in you
[1:36:41] what signs god did in christ christ does
[1:36:44] in you
[1:36:46] so when christ walked the shores of
[1:36:48] galilee and he walked by and he healed
[1:36:50] the leopard
[1:36:52] and he healed the blinded eyes
[1:36:55] and he raised the dead
[1:36:57] the prophet of god the bible even tells
[1:36:59] us all that was in god he poured into
[1:37:01] christ all that was in christ he poured
[1:37:03] into the church
[1:37:04] so then somewhere these things has got
[1:37:06] to be in the body
[1:37:11] and let me just tell you where you won't
[1:37:13] find them
[1:37:15] in a cold dead morgue
[1:37:20] well jason we don't worship like you do
[1:37:22] in your church
[1:37:23] i don't really care how you worship
[1:37:25] and so long as you worship
[1:37:29] well brother justin we don't want to get
[1:37:31] out of the water the holy ghost won't
[1:37:32] get out of order
[1:37:35] listen but the same prophet of god also
[1:37:37] said oh we're afraid to get out of
[1:37:38] church or he goes you need to once in a
[1:37:40] while
[1:37:40] so maybe you'd get saved
[1:37:42] [Applause]
[1:37:44] huh let's say all of what he said
[1:37:46] let's not hold back and pick our
[1:37:48] favorite quotes out and then and do away
[1:37:50] with every move of god you cannot do
[1:37:52] that if god is there he will move
[1:37:56] [Applause]
[1:38:00] so all that god did the signs that god
[1:38:01] did in christ christ does in you
[1:38:05] and jesus said that that day
[1:38:09] you will know that i am in the father
[1:38:10] and the father in me
[1:38:12] and i knew
[1:38:14] and you
[1:38:15] in me
[1:38:17] so we have the devil's answer
[1:38:19] it's not me that liveth
[1:38:21] but it's christ that liveth in me
[1:38:24] it's not me that does the works but it's
[1:38:26] christ that liveth in me
[1:38:29] then when the revelations comes forth
[1:38:31] then it's i'm in you and you and me
[1:38:34] there is a harmony between you and
[1:38:36] christ
[1:38:38] and it's the holy spirit pulsating
[1:38:42] living in you
[1:38:46] matter of fact brother branson is
[1:38:47] showing a personal vindication of the
[1:38:49] word
[1:38:52] because he's living in you
[1:38:56] we have to have that moment to where our
[1:38:58] lives
[1:38:59] become changed
[1:39:02] you have to be born again
[1:39:04] it's a must in this hour
[1:39:07] brother said without it you're lost
[1:39:10] signs of the messiah no matter how good
[1:39:13] you are
[1:39:14] cain was as good as abel worshiped the
[1:39:16] same as abel built the church the same
[1:39:18] as abel made a sacrifice the same as
[1:39:20] abel
[1:39:22] and god rejected him because he didn't
[1:39:24] have spiritual revelation
[1:39:27] he said what was right jesus said upon
[1:39:29] the same spiritual revelation he'd built
[1:39:32] his church
[1:39:34] excuse me and the gates of hell could
[1:39:36] not prevail against it
[1:39:41] so where is he at
[1:39:43] he's here
[1:39:46] you've seen me
[1:39:48] you've seen god come down in a service
[1:39:50] you've seen god do the impossible you've
[1:39:53] seen god do the miraculous right here in
[1:39:55] your church
[1:39:56] you've witnessed those things
[1:39:59] we all have that believe in the
[1:40:00] supernatural move of god we witness god
[1:40:03] moving
[1:40:04] we see things happening
[1:40:06] two weeks ago i was sitting there
[1:40:09] and i was preaching and and it was one
[1:40:11] of those services that wasn't real
[1:40:12] gentle you know you it was kind of
[1:40:14] correction
[1:40:16] i don't like to have to preach those but
[1:40:17] sometimes you do
[1:40:20] there was this young man there who was
[1:40:22] had come with a girl
[1:40:25] and she was backslid and
[1:40:28] she brought this boy he'd been coming
[1:40:29] for a while
[1:40:31] and he just sat in church and
[1:40:33] she was gum
[1:40:36] i'd preach away and he'd chew his gum
[1:40:40] but two sundays ago was kindly different
[1:40:43] i was preaching away
[1:40:45] and he's right there with me
[1:40:47] following me
[1:40:48] tuned in
[1:40:51] everybody i don't say everybody else but
[1:40:53] several other people commented
[1:40:55] that brother was tuned in this morning
[1:40:57] well after church i just went and sat in
[1:40:59] the truck i was
[1:41:00] wore out one sitting the truck he'd come
[1:41:02] knocking on the window brother jason
[1:41:05] will you baptize me
[1:41:08] i said brother have you repented
[1:41:10] yes i have i said i'll be glad to
[1:41:12] baptize you
[1:41:13] in the name of the lord jesus listen
[1:41:15] church you don't ever know how god's
[1:41:17] going to move on a person
[1:41:19] we don't ever know how god's going to
[1:41:20] bring somebody in it's beyond our
[1:41:23] understanding sometimes
[1:41:25] but when god moves he moves
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:30] we want to see god manifesting himself
[1:41:32] in the body
[1:41:36] and then when god manifests he goes a
[1:41:37] vindicated word and his body is his very
[1:41:39] victory that's the reason of his death
[1:41:42] that's not in the spirit when he died he
[1:41:43] only died in the flesh his spirit went
[1:41:45] to help preach to the souls that were in
[1:41:46] prison
[1:41:48] his flesh only died when he was raised
[1:41:50] up again and quickened which means made
[1:41:52] alive
[1:41:53] excuse me his flesh which was his body
[1:41:56] and that's the word it's been laying
[1:41:59] dead for years
[1:42:02] but it's gradually begin to come in the
[1:42:05] reformation
[1:42:07] so now they're beginning to come life to
[1:42:09] it again it begin to grow a little
[1:42:12] in reformation but he says now
[1:42:15] she's standing up on her feet
[1:42:19] it went through a time where it was dead
[1:42:21] for years
[1:42:25] then the luther came
[1:42:27] and then a wesley came
[1:42:29] and then an isuzu street came
[1:42:31] now zuzu street ain't the original
[1:42:33] pentecost
[1:42:36] that was only some gifts
[1:42:38] supernatural movements happening gifts
[1:42:40] restored and things of that that wasn't
[1:42:42] the original pentecost
[1:42:44] the original pentecost still hadn't come
[1:42:46] yet
[1:42:47] but then it come up to grain time
[1:42:50] it come up to seed time
[1:42:52] it come up to this time
[1:42:54] and now there's a bride standing on her
[1:42:57] feet in this hour
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:02] [Music]
[1:43:04] well if i had time to go back and
[1:43:06] pick up those dry bones
[1:43:09] brother tim says i got plenty of time
[1:43:11] in his time i got plenty of time
[1:43:13] thank you
[1:43:15] go back and look at the dry bones
[1:43:18] there was a valley full of bones and the
[1:43:19] prophet ezekiel come up
[1:43:22] there was no skin on them there was no
[1:43:24] sinus on them they were just laying
[1:43:26] there they were separated
[1:43:30] the legs wasn't connected to the hips
[1:43:32] and the hips wasn't connected to the
[1:43:33] back everything was separated the head
[1:43:35] wasn't connected to the
[1:43:38] to the spine
[1:43:40] it was all a wreck
[1:43:43] and the prophet the word of the lord
[1:43:45] speaks to the prophet son of man can
[1:43:48] these bones live
[1:43:52] said lord thou long know us
[1:43:55] yeah
[1:43:57] he said i'll tell you what you do then
[1:43:59] prophesy
[1:44:02] and he begins to prophesy
[1:44:04] and when he prophesied the bones began
[1:44:07] coming back together
[1:44:10] listen brother johnny didn't get brother
[1:44:13] elle's hip
[1:44:15] if they would have been there
[1:44:17] you got your own hip
[1:44:19] he didn't get brother elle's head or you
[1:44:21] didn't get his head
[1:44:22] amen huh
[1:44:25] you understand but you each come to his
[1:44:27] own body
[1:44:30] it each came to its own possession
[1:44:34] and then as it begin to come to position
[1:44:36] now they're just lifeless still yet and
[1:44:38] he said oh son of a hand prophesy again
[1:44:42] they begin to prophesy again and the sin
[1:44:44] use begin to came and the skin begin to
[1:44:46] come and it was a great army
[1:44:49] but they still didn't have breath
[1:44:53] oh son of man
[1:44:55] can these bones live
[1:44:58] thou don't know us lord then begin to
[1:45:00] prophesy again and the wind began to
[1:45:03] blow and it come in here and blew life
[1:45:05] into them
[1:45:07] and there arose an exceedingly great
[1:45:10] irony
[1:45:13] glory to god i think about another group
[1:45:15] of bones
[1:45:18] that were in this thou this day
[1:45:22] church bones
[1:45:26] the devil thought he had us all
[1:45:29] devil thought he had a whip back there
[1:45:31] when they began to die down through the
[1:45:33] church ages
[1:45:35] and then luther began to speak
[1:45:38] things begin to happen
[1:45:40] reformation wesley speaks
[1:45:42] pentecost comes
[1:45:44] but they still ain't got life yet
[1:45:47] they got what they thought was life
[1:45:50] but they didn't really they had never
[1:45:51] really yet been burned all the way with
[1:45:54] the word
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:45:58] and then all of a sudden in this hour
[1:46:01] god begins to use a man to speak the
[1:46:03] word
[1:46:05] and breathe the breath of life
[1:46:12] risen
[1:46:14] i'm here
[1:46:15] the headship has come
[1:46:17] and he begins to preach all these
[1:46:19] sermons to us invisible union
[1:46:23] why we are not a denomination
[1:46:26] jezebel religion
[1:46:27] he goes down the line he begins
[1:46:29] preaching he's saying the seals doubt
[1:46:31] become open and brother branham said my
[1:46:33] bible become a new book and he caught
[1:46:35] the revelation now it was more than just
[1:46:38] a man now the mighty angel had descended
[1:46:42] and when the mighty angel descends he
[1:46:45] breathes life
[1:46:48] into a bride
[1:46:50] that was stale
[1:46:54] that was cold
[1:46:56] that was locked up in denominations
[1:46:59] that was locked up in message creeds
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:08] brother jason we're perusia
[1:47:11] well god bless you
[1:47:13] i'm a christian
[1:47:17] well i believe this
[1:47:19] god bless you i believe all the message
[1:47:23] well i got no i'm not interested in your
[1:47:25] slant
[1:47:26] i'm interested in one thing
[1:47:28] what's the pure revealed word of god
[1:47:30] your slant will never produce a rapture
[1:47:33] there's one word that'll produce a
[1:47:35] rapture that's what's been revealed by
[1:47:37] the mighty angel in this day and hour
[1:47:39] it's not an idea
[1:47:43] it's his word
[1:47:45] it's not a thought it's the word
[1:47:47] revealed
[1:47:48] who's it being revealed in me
[1:47:57] and the word began to be prophesied in
[1:47:58] this day and hour
[1:48:01] christ beginning to be made manifest in
[1:48:04] his bride
[1:48:06] and that's why demons can be cast out
[1:48:11] that's what the devil's howling about we
[1:48:12] got his answer
[1:48:15] that's why youth camps and some of the
[1:48:17] special meetings and someone ain't in
[1:48:18] special meetings demon spirits will cry
[1:48:21] out in people
[1:48:23] and they'll challenge god
[1:48:27] i'm getting somewhere i'm trying to
[1:48:29] anyway
[1:48:31] i feel like i'm just getting started
[1:48:36] and he'll challenge
[1:48:38] and let me tell you
[1:48:39] it won't work in an unconverted channel
[1:48:43] you'll never make the devil moved in an
[1:48:45] unconverted channel
[1:48:47] there was a showdown one day between god
[1:48:49] and satan jesus and satan they had a
[1:48:51] showdown
[1:48:53] two great forces brother said satan come
[1:48:55] with knowledge
[1:48:58] he knew the word
[1:49:01] but he was unconverted
[1:49:03] so he couldn't do anything with the word
[1:49:05] but perverted
[1:49:07] but jesus already knew who he was
[1:49:10] so when satan would come to jesus with
[1:49:12] the word jesus was the word he knew who
[1:49:15] he was satan questioned who he was
[1:49:20] what he did in christ
[1:49:23] he's gonna do in you
[1:49:26] jesus knew who he was
[1:49:28] you better know who you are
[1:49:30] and if you're sleeping this morning
[1:49:32] you're going to miss it
[1:49:34] listen the devil's trying to rock you to
[1:49:35] sleep and later we'll see you we need to
[1:49:37] shake ourselves this morning this is not
[1:49:40] time for the devil to rock you asleep
[1:49:49] we get so caught up in things we're
[1:49:51] missing the very manifestation of the
[1:49:52] word that's happening before us
[1:49:57] i asked my church the other day i said
[1:49:59] how many times how many of you have
[1:50:00] looked at your screen time
[1:50:05] check your bible app
[1:50:08] versus your facebook app
[1:50:14] we're lacking
[1:50:16] we got our priorities messed up
[1:50:18] satan's sitting here
[1:50:20] oh i get them caught up in this and you
[1:50:22] still may be a christian i'm not saying
[1:50:23] you're not a christian
[1:50:24] but the devil robs you of what you could
[1:50:27] have
[1:50:28] all the time we spend on facebook insta
[1:50:31] book or insta book
[1:50:32] whatever it is
[1:50:34] face gram insta book we'll get it right
[1:50:36] what we've learned
[1:50:38] snapchat twitter whatever
[1:50:41] we get caught up on those things we miss
[1:50:43] what god's trying to do
[1:50:45] you could instead be listening to the
[1:50:46] word of god
[1:50:48] i'm not saying you can't have time for
[1:50:49] natural things that's not what i'm
[1:50:50] saying but when it becomes your priority
[1:50:55] listen this message should be your
[1:50:57] priority
[1:50:58] we're getting ready for a rapture
[1:51:01] and in case you hadn't noticed
[1:51:04] it's really close

[1:54:51] it's written in the word quote now the
[1:54:53] book of psalms
[1:54:54] jesus could quote him right back out of
[1:54:56] the book of psalms because he was the
[1:54:58] book
[1:55:00] there was a difference satan knew it up
[1:55:02] here but jesus wasn't
[1:55:05] so when the devil comes to you and
[1:55:06] tempts you and tells you it's okay and
[1:55:09] says oh surely god won't do that though
[1:55:11] you better be the book
[1:55:17] brother tim years ago preach the sermon
[1:55:18] the people of the open book
[1:55:20] we are the book
[1:55:24] satan quoted the same word
[1:55:29] he goes to church every sunday
[1:55:33] he goes every wednesday
[1:55:36] he knew it by knowledge jesus knew it by
[1:55:38] experience in revelation for he was it
[1:55:41] jesus knew his
[1:55:44] adversary so no matter how much
[1:55:47] knowledge you have
[1:55:48] it'll never make the devil leave it'll
[1:55:50] never cause you to be victorious
[1:55:53] you'll never overcome a single thing in
[1:55:55] your life just with head knowledge
[1:55:57] [Applause]
[1:55:59] but until it becomes a manifested
[1:56:00] revealed worthy howard and it drops down
[1:56:03] to the inside of your soul you will not
[1:56:06] be changed
[1:56:08] we have a young man any young man he's
[1:56:10] older than i am he's 55 or 56 he smoked
[1:56:14] for
[1:56:15] almost
[1:56:16] 45 years
[1:56:19] he was coming to church
[1:56:22] still smoking
[1:56:24] how's that the close of the service
[1:56:26] almost something changed in the building
[1:56:31] and i was actually dealing with a man's
[1:56:33] sister trying to
[1:56:34] i didn't call her out but i was just
[1:56:36] telling you can be free you know
[1:56:38] drug addiction
[1:56:40] something struck me and i looked over at
[1:56:41] him
[1:56:43] and i said
[1:56:45] and he won't mind me using his name
[1:56:47] as a testimony i said brother richard
[1:56:49] you can lay those things down and never
[1:56:51] pick them back up this morning
[1:56:54] but if i was you i'd stand up and tell
[1:56:57] god
[1:56:58] i'm never picking them up again i'm not
[1:57:01] never going back that way again
[1:57:04] listen you got to take a step toward god
[1:57:07] that man jumped up out of his pew he
[1:57:10] said i promise i promise i promise
[1:57:15] that was two years ago last september
[1:57:23] not only that but he was living in
[1:57:24] adultery at the time and god delivered
[1:57:27] him of that also
[1:57:28] [Applause]
[1:57:31] that's because the headship
[1:57:33] has come down
[1:57:35] and united with the body
[1:57:38] and he's raising a body up
[1:57:40] it wasn't me it was his decision
[1:57:45] i could have told him all day he needed
[1:57:46] to quit smoking
[1:57:49] but when he told
[1:57:50] god i'm done with this devil
[1:57:53] revelation struck his heart
[1:57:58] makes a huge difference
[1:58:00] it's got to become leave the head
[1:58:02] drop down into the heart
[1:58:05] you can plant us how can you plant a
[1:58:06] seed if it's growing and not manifest
[1:58:09] what it is
[1:58:11] you plant a seed of the enemy it'll grow
[1:58:13] if you water it
[1:58:15] it'll manifest
[1:58:16] you plant the seed of god
[1:58:18] it'll manifest and jesus said these
[1:58:20] signs shall follow them
[1:58:22] that belief
[1:58:26] and david said lord i've hid thy word in
[1:58:28] my heart
[1:58:29] i've meditated i meditate on it day and
[1:58:31] night
[1:58:33] they're written on my bedposts and
[1:58:35] everywhere
[1:58:36] jesus said your name's engraved in the
[1:58:38] palms of my head how are you ever going
[1:58:40] to be forgotten
[1:58:45] i feel like i'm on an island this
[1:58:47] morning although he's still in the boat
[1:58:49] with you
[1:58:50] he has never left you he will never
[1:58:52] leave you nor forsake you
[1:58:54] and jesus defeated satan upon
[1:58:57] faith
[1:58:58] and knowing who he was
[1:59:01] what about this predestinated bride of
[1:59:03] christ now
[1:59:08] you got the word seed in you
[1:59:11] absolutely brother jason
[1:59:14] then everything that god promised
[1:59:16] to put in his church
[1:59:18] is here
[1:59:22] we're not waiting for anything else to
[1:59:23] come
[1:59:25] brother brahm said it's here
[1:59:27] everything he promised brother tyler's
[1:59:29] here everything you need if you're
[1:59:31] struggling everything you need is here
[1:59:34] it's already brother man said even the
[1:59:36] rapture is in you once you receive the
[1:59:38] baptism of the holy ghost everything you

[1:59:56] the holy spirit has been given
[1:59:58] the seed has been sown
[2:00:01] the evening lights have been shining the
[2:00:03] sign of sodom that jesus promised is
[2:00:05] here
[2:00:08] malachi 4 has come
[2:00:11] a predestinated church is now standing
[2:00:13] on her feet

[2:00:29] there's a bride here who's recognized
[2:00:32] who she is
[2:00:35] he goes how's satan going to stand
[2:00:36] against that
[2:00:40] excuse me how is he going to stop that
[2:00:42] from growing
[2:00:43] how is he going to stop them signs from
[2:00:45] following it
[2:00:46] you could throw him in jail they've
[2:00:48] already threw her family in jail
[2:00:52] didn't work too well for him
[2:00:54] it was about midnight
[2:00:56] paul and silas
[2:00:59] brother philip i don't know why i just
[2:01:01] thought of you when i thought of paul
[2:01:02] and silas
[2:01:04] brother phillip might have been down
[2:01:06] there at midnight
[2:01:08] sitting in a cell somewhere
[2:01:10] not physically
[2:01:12] spiritually
[2:01:13] he was in a sail
[2:01:16] and he looked out one day and saw a
[2:01:18] water tower
[2:01:20] because he always was a son
[2:01:23] but he got some amnesia
[2:01:26] but one day the water tower caught his
[2:01:28] attention
[2:01:30] let me tell you that's because he's a
[2:01:32] seed of god
[2:01:34] and every seed of god has their moment
[2:01:37] of recognition i have a seed
[2:01:40] [Applause]
[2:01:47] paula silas is sitting in jail
[2:01:49] about midnight
[2:01:52] wait why don't we sing a song
[2:01:55] i'm talking aaron because me and neither
[2:01:57] here one can sing
[2:02:02] i don't think so
[2:02:05] we begin to say
[2:02:08] about that time something began to
[2:02:09] happen in the house
[2:02:11] a shaking began to happen
[2:02:14] chains were up on us
[2:02:16] but we begin to praising god
[2:02:19] listen church i don't care what kind of
[2:02:20] trouble you're in this morning if you
[2:02:22] begin to praise god chains will begin to
[2:02:24] fall around you circumstances are
[2:02:26] beginning to drop around you your enemy
[2:02:28] will become to begin to change he'll
[2:02:30] begin to back up because you know who
[2:02:32] you are you know who you believed in you
[2:02:34] know who you're trusting in you know
[2:02:36] where you're going
[2:02:37] [Applause]
[2:02:41] back up
[2:02:44] devil chains fell off of them
[2:02:51] you imagine
[2:02:52] ladies over playing at the house one
[2:02:54] night
[2:02:55] and peter's down there in jail
[2:02:58] and they're praying for his deliverance
[2:03:01] and all of a sudden the angel of the
[2:03:02] lord takes him out of the jail sets him
[2:03:04] on the outside he gets on the outside he
[2:03:05] begins processing what just happened
[2:03:08] well i'm gonna go over to their house
[2:03:10] he knocks on the gate
[2:03:13] let me in
[2:03:15] hey the young lady i believe it was
[2:03:17] lydia runs through the door she looks
[2:03:19] out she hears the voice it's peter she
[2:03:21] forgets him at the gate
[2:03:24] runs back into the house and tells him
[2:03:26] peter's outside
[2:03:28] no way
[2:03:30] peter's in prison
[2:03:33] but we're praying for his deliverance
[2:03:36] why are we surprised when he's delivered
[2:03:42] when you ask god for something don't be
[2:03:44] shocked when it happens
[2:03:47] be excited about it run and tell others
[2:03:50] about it
[2:03:52] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:03:53] forever
[2:03:55] so you can lock it up in prison
[2:03:57] you can't stop it
[2:04:00] brother caleb was in prison over in
[2:04:01] china
[2:04:02] didn't have bibles
[2:04:04] didn't have anything
[2:04:05] started leading muslims to christ
[2:04:11] because when you become the bible
[2:04:14] when you become the message
[2:04:16] you don't have to have a book
[2:04:18] we appreciate them you don't have to
[2:04:20] have a tape we appreciate them but you
[2:04:23] have to become the word manifested and
[2:04:26] made flesh yourself
[2:04:29] and when that happens nothing is
[2:04:30] impossible
[2:04:32] they've rotted in jails they've was fed
[2:04:34] the lines they were sold asunder they
[2:04:36] were jerked to pieces
[2:04:38] but you can't kill this
[2:04:43] you can't kill the revelation
[2:04:45] you might kill the man but you can't
[2:04:46] kill the spirit
[2:04:48] the spirit of god lives on
[2:04:50] brother ram says they might hush my
[2:04:51] voice but or hush me but the spirit will
[2:04:54] live on
[2:04:56] listen and in this day the spirit's
[2:04:58] still living
[2:05:00] where here at evening like tabernacle
[2:05:04] very christian tabernacle that happy
[2:05:06] valley wherever it may be
[2:05:09] jesus christ is still alive and well
[2:05:15] and everything's in order
[2:05:18] the world's in order
[2:05:20] for jesus to come back
[2:05:23] it's ripe
[2:05:25] it's close
[2:05:30] very close
[2:05:31] something's about to happen
[2:05:34] people are nervous
[2:05:36] they're scared
[2:05:38] i told the church back home i said hey
[2:05:39] don't be scared don't be afraid of
[2:05:41] what's happening in the world we'll be
[2:05:42] excited
[2:05:44] the natural man gets the mastermind he's
[2:05:46] american you don't like what's happening
[2:05:48] but the spiritual man on the inside is
[2:05:50] looking at the revealed word of the hour
[2:05:52] i am if i am who i say i am then this
[2:05:56] mess out here shouldn't shake me
[2:05:58] [Applause]
[2:06:01] because i got the devil's answer
[2:06:06] world's in order time shaping up he said
[2:06:09] church is in order
[2:06:11] seed's been sowed
[2:06:13] and right here in the last days a
[2:06:16] predestinated church
[2:06:18] knowing where they're standing
[2:06:20] so will the seed
[2:06:22] the holy spirit in the church
[2:06:26] and then he says satan
[2:06:28] be careful
[2:06:31] be careful satan
[2:06:33] you're picking on the wrong people
[2:06:35] you're picking on my brother ron spencer
[2:06:37] right now you better watch out
[2:06:40] don't you remember how many times you've
[2:06:41] already been whip picking on that man
[2:06:44] well you've picked on him and picked on
[2:06:45] him hey there ain't nobody that i know
[2:06:47] been through more than him
[2:06:49] maybe there is i just don't know
[2:06:51] but let me tell you every time the
[2:06:53] devil's picked on him he's lost
[2:07:00] and now cancer's picking on him cancer's
[2:07:03] a loser
[2:07:05] i said cancer is a loser
[2:07:08] the devil is a loser
[2:07:11] satan be careful this morning you've
[2:07:14] chose the wrong people to pick on we
[2:07:17] know we are the bride of christ
[2:07:19] [Applause]
[2:07:24] you better watch it you're going to fly
[2:07:26] into one of us
[2:07:28] you're going to hit that 100 billion
[2:07:30] vote wine
[2:07:31] like you did when you flew into jesus
[2:07:33] brother and some of the devil flew into
[2:07:35] jesus he hit that 100 billion vote line
[2:07:37] and it sends his feathers
[2:07:39] he said he fell back a lot quicker than
[2:07:41] what he can
[2:07:44] he said because the line was energized
[2:07:47] it had dynamo in it but satan's line had
[2:07:50] no connection
[2:07:51] [Applause]
[2:07:53] hallelujah and if he's the same in the
[2:07:55] church as he was in jesus christ
[2:08:01] he flies into brother ron
[2:08:07] cancer
[2:08:10] he's had it a lot longer than he ever
[2:08:11] knew
[2:08:12] years maybe
[2:08:14] didn't know it
[2:08:18] secret silent killer
[2:08:20] so satan thinks
[2:08:22] secretly came in
[2:08:24] through maybe a spot on his arm or
[2:08:27] his head or whatever it might have been
[2:08:29] and he comes in trying to secretly take
[2:08:31] his life without him recognizing it
[2:08:38] but the same god that was sitting there
[2:08:39] when you and brother
[2:08:41] donnie prayed for him in his house
[2:08:45] i had no idea they was praying for him
[2:08:46] in his house
[2:08:48] i'm sitting in my office and i look up
[2:08:50] my window and there's an eagle sitting
[2:08:53] in a tree
[2:08:54] and i'm studying and you know i started
[2:08:56] studying on eagles in but
[2:08:58] something come to me tell brother ron
[2:09:01] remember what i told him i will use you
[2:09:05] like never before
[2:09:08] i sent it to him immediately they had
[2:09:10] just been praying let me tell you it's
[2:09:12] not me it wasn't them it's christ
[2:09:16] and i declared if god takes him today
[2:09:19] he's used him like never before
[2:09:22] god has kept his word but we're
[2:09:24] believing for deliverance
[2:09:26] [Applause]
[2:09:30] so satan
[2:09:31] be careful
[2:09:34] we got your answer
[2:09:36] it's not us that's living
[2:09:38] it's christ in us
[2:09:39] it's christ then brother ron
[2:09:41] it's not brother ron doing it
[2:09:45] we all love him
[2:09:47] and we're all holding him up
[2:09:50] let me tell you
[2:09:51] don't quit praying for him it could be
[2:09:53] your prayer
[2:09:55] that'd be the key
[2:09:56] to set the devil a fled
[2:09:59] i don't care who it is in the body of
[2:10:00] christ keep praying for the request this
[2:10:03] morning keep praying for we don't know
[2:10:05] what god might do for this little
[2:10:06] nine-year-old girl

[2:10:16] was down in prison he was in a lion's
[2:10:18] den

[2:11:11] to give us the very desires of our heart

[2:11:52] the one that saves the lost he's the one
[2:11:53] that gives the holy ghost no man can
