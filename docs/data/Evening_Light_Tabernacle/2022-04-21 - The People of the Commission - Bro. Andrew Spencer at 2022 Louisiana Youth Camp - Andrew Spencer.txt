easter he is risen he has risen from the grave and we are here to testify of his resurrection this morning there's no there's no there's no there's no love and there's no power like this power brother brown would say what a resurrection that was but he would also say what a resurrection this is hallelujah [Music] isn't god good to us [Applause] wow what a what a tremendous victory that we seen last evening so many victories so many testimonies that will come forth and we just say praise the lord we'll just say praise i got what i came for when i came to this camp amen to watch to watch my pastor have a desire to stay all the way through a play through a prayer line and then to just go ahead and dance all over the enemy i got what i came for but i believe god's got a little something else for us today and you know let's just go ahead and dance all over his his head one more time today and man if you have your bibles this morning we'd like to look over in the book of joshua chapter one and verse three i won't be long this morning and i know that you'll appreciate me for that but as i've said before if you a man fast i'll preach fast amen joshua chapter 1 and verse 3 before we read let's just speak to the author of the word father we come unto you lord one more time we dedicate our life unto you father you are the author and a finisher of our faith father to sense and be aware of the very god of heaven that is here this morning we've gathered lord one more time to sit under the auspices of the holy spirit father let your holy spirit pour out your life upon us one more time father we thank you father for what you have done in this camp and i pray father that your blessings would follow them all the days of their life i pray that you would touch them in a mighty way father as they leave this camp today father may they not leave here lord jesus may they not leave here father and just leave all the camp experience here but may they take it back to their church may they take it back to their normal life and father i pray that you would help them lord on their journeys and in their trials may they feed the experience of the holy spirit we ask this today on this easter day that one more time that we would see the resurrection and the life right here amongst us in this house today we love and appreciate you in the name of the lord jesus christ and the bride said amen joshua 1 and verse 3 every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and under the great sea dwarf the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee as i was with brother ron so i will be with you as i was with william branham so i will be with you i will not fail you young people i will not forsake you young people be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shall thou divide an inheritance in the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to all to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever thou goes may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord also in romans 8 and verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father it's an amazing thing to begin to think this morning that the god of heaven wants to be a part of your daily lives outside of this outside of this meeting he didn't just bring you to this meeting so that you could have a camp experience or just to just to have something that would stay here in this building but something that would take you and it would lead you all the days of your life maybe you came here seeking more of the holy ghost maybe you came here just just just desiring different things in your life but god is not wanting it just to stay here but god is wanting to take you all the way through all your life and to begin to think that the god of heaven that spoke the worlds into existence to think that that god has predetermined this time and the times that are set before you he is set and he has predetermined our comings and predetermined our goings and but i believe that we are a people of of the last stage of people that as brother ron preached last night of final runners but a people that have caught the inspiration of the word and truly we are moving into the atmosphere of romans 8 1 that there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus and we are watching what william branham was was seeing in vision has now become materialistic and we are watching a bride rising out of the scriptures when you go to studying over in the book of revelation and you see when jesus is there standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and he's saying and he's holding those seven stars in his hands you can imagine how that how the how that god felt when he was as he was holding those seven stars in his hands he's built them in such a way he's got characteristics and paul characteristics and in luther and wesley and william branham but to watch as as he would as he would scatter as he would send out those messengers to that day you can imagine how that god felt knowing that as i release this star from my hand it's going to go out and it's going to bring unto me a people that have my characteristic they're identified with my identity because my life is on the inside of them and it is my seed that has placed them where they are you can imagine how god felt knowing that there was no corruption in the body then and knowing that there is no corruption in the body now and we know that god has not had a new thought about about anything in his life so what god's seen you as is what you will be so so no matter what you go through after this camp no matter what you go through know how no matter how long we go throughout this layout of seeing age god has not had a new thought about you what you are is what you will be what he's seen you as before the foundation of the world is exactly what he sees you as and what you will be no matter what you come up against young people you have been destined to fulfill a commission and that's what i want to preach to you this morning on is the people of this commission god didn't just raise up god doesn't just didn't raise us up just to have another church group or just to have another young people or just to have another church service or just to have another building but god raised up a people that would fulfill the purpose in their life god has a purpose for your life young people the enemy might want to tell you that you don't have a purpose but god has a plan for your life and you would go to studying out the bible brother adam would tell us that satan hates two books of the bible and it's genesis and revelations because one tells of his beginning and then one tales of his ending and we realize that we have already read the back of the book we know what it says about satan we know what it says about his future but young people you've got a future it's not the future of destruction it's not the future of laodicea it's not the future of depression it's not the future of diseases your future is a rapture your future is a body change your future is destined for glory to walk on streets of gold and to be exactly what god destined for you to be before the foundation of the world you will not let this word fall on the ground because you are a part of god and when you see that word laying there you'll see i'll be that one i'll pick up that stone i'll pick up that rock i pick up my sword i am here to fulfill i am here to possess every gate of the enemy brother man would say he said i wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when when satan knows that he's going to be exposed he said it isn't the people that i'm talking about it's it's that satan has got to hold in their lives so sin indifference disease but you should see their faces he said satan knows that he's going to be exposed and most peculiar changes come over the people countenance and he said satan is afraid he knows that the spirit of god is about to let the people know of his works that is why he hates these meetings so much when names are called and diseases are revealed satan hates it he said now what is this it's not mind reading it's not telepathy it's it it he said nor is it witchcraft he said it is a revelation by the holy ghost he said that is the only way that i can know it of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the holy ghost now watch you watch after this meaning there will be all kinds of carnality of men that try to stop what happened here they will try to say that it was just a workup of man they'll try to say that you just got under the atmosphere of a man but you didn't get in the atmosphere of a man there's no way that a man can make you do what you do because you are destined to walk over top of the enemy if it was that easy then why wouldn't we just walk out into walmart and said why don't you do this but you have walked into the presence of the shekinah glory and revelation gives you authority and when you recognize your position in jesus christ hell knows it's going to lose hell knows it can't win hell knows it ain't got you no more satan watched you young people last night he watched what you did and you rejected the devil's lie you turned down and you said i will stand for god when nobody else will stand and satan realizes that you cut a hold of something that'll take you further than a camp experience more than just a church service more than just a motion but a revelation that gives you authority to walk as joshua was commanded to walk over every possession that was rightfully his [Music] he said but let me show you another reason that satan hates this book of revelation of jesus christ in the church he knows that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows he knows a whole lot more than do 90 of the theologians he knows that since god he knows that since god is immutable in his nature that he's immutable in his ways thus satan knows assuredly that the original church of pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action is the true church that jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be he said but remember this that christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts brother branham would say that what pentecost was what pentecost was at the beginning was a standard so if we're going to be a standard if god is going to raise a standard we've got to go back to the standard of pentecost we've got to go back to the apostolic faith this message isn't something new this message isn't something that just came about but this is a restoration of the faith of the apostolic fathers our hearts have been turned back and you have been divinely appointed to fulfill your commission to do what you can do and only what you could do and if it was easy anybody would do it but god is not looking for somebody that's got a wishbone god is looking for somebody that's got the backbone like a small log like buddy robinson would say that's got power to live in overcoming life got power to defeat the devil because you've got the same power the same life the same holy ghost brother madam said that the holy ghost gives you power of speech power of prayer power to live a holy life power to overcome the world someone that's moving in the spirit of the composer that's moving in the rhythm [Applause] now what i love what i love is good music what i love i'd rather pray i'd rather sing than i would preach but it's been my lord in life to go ahead and preach to you so maybe i'll sing to you while i preach a little bit today but when you start moving in the rhythm of the music you ever watch somebody when they're off beat you can't help that person to save their life they clap off hands it's a pandemic sometimes when they can't even they can't even clap to save their hands but god they can't clap to save their hands bless god that case but you watch somebody that don't they just don't know how to do it they don't know what they're doing it seems like man every they look like a fish out of water but you want somebody that's moving in the rhythm of the music so let me say this the methodists can't clap their life can't clap their hands to save their hands the westlands can't move like you are moving they cannot move in the rhythm of the message of the hour but you have been destined young people to walk in the spirit of the composer to move in the rhythm of the music when he says there is no weapon that is formed against you you move into the rhythm and say that's for me that this is a faith that overcometh the world this is our victory this is our triumph this is our glory this is our moment and you start moving into the spirit of the composer you got the sheet music if the sheet music says that i'm the lord thy god that heals all of your diseases there's going to be somebody that aircraft amen i'm the lord that god that still saves young people amen i'm the lord thy god that still delivers i'm the lord thy god that'll keep you i'm the lord thy god that'll sustain you now notice you can be seated just for a moment he said in the invisible union he said we know that the modern church in its present condition in its present state is in no condition to finish up the great commission that god gave the church for this day he said we know that the church could not the pentecostal church by no means could carry out the last day's message in its present condition he said why he can't even agree with one or two three words how you going to do it he can't do it you see denominations is out he said it's going to be an elected people that's elected for it you are elected to tear satan's kingdom down you are elected to walk into the full manifestation of the sons of god and when you start watching jesus's first commission and jesus's last commission your watch has got the same works when he commissioned his church over in luke chapter 10 that he taught him to go out there and preach the gospel to lay hands on them and you watch his second commission his last commission the great commission it had the same works it had the same power and it was go out and lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name shall they cast out their voice in my name shall they tread over serpents and young people you've got a job to do it ain't just my job it ain't just brother ron's job but you've got a job to do and you've been elected to rise above every critic to rise above every skeptic to rise above every power and to rise above every devil of hell well lebron when he come he preached the three calls he even preached a threefold purpose and christ the mystery of god revealed he said first it's to reveal himself second to have the preeminence and third it was to restore the kingdom back to its rightful position and here he has came down and he has revealed himself and now he has the preeminence in his body and he is descending once again but on rapture mourning he won't leave you because there's something on the inside of you that he cannot leave because our identity is attached to his identity you do not you cannot exist without him what good would it do to give this young people a bunch of power what what would good what good would it do to give them a task or give them a job if god didn't give them he didn't give them the ability or if he didn't give them the knowledge to be able to create and finish the work but god has given you ability young people to go out there and cast out every devil he's given you a power to walk and tread over serpents he what good would it have done to give josh with the land and tell him that it's yours if you go studying it out it was the same land that was promised to his father abraham he'd give him an ability to walk out there and go in there and take it over and there's a young people that have risen up in satan's eden that are facing the darkest of days facing every movement of hell every right every right that that the enemy is trying to take away from you you are rising up and say not today satan you are facing every devil you are facing every enemy that's been released out of river euphrates but god has not sent you here unequipped he has sent you here with the most powerful weapon that can be placed in the hands of humanity and that's the word of god hallelujah jesus said even the spirit of truth john 14-17 even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you he said i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but you see me because i live you live also at that day you shall know that i am in the father and the father me and i in you and you and me revelation gives you authority and this is your day this is your moment you have been risen for this time for this moment for this hour at this day satan will not win satan couldn't stop cancer satan couldn't stop saying couldn't stop brother with cancer satan can't stop you with all the things in your life you have been commissioned to walk out there and take back everything that the devil has stole from you he's not sent you here weaponless but this is the hour of full manifested sons of god that walk out there and take every power away from satan to walk out there you are watching the manifestation of almighty god being dispersed into a pediatric a people imparted with the same power with the same life you see brother random said that god knew that we were coming into a great intellectual move just like just like jesus did when he came in his days he said but that's why he sent you a comforter that i will not leave you and i will not forsake you jesus paul said in second corinthians 10 he said our weapons are not carnal but mighty and bringing down the strongholds of satan and casting down every imagination and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god god didn't walk in here and tell you you've got power just so you can let those things stay in your life young people you're not going to walk out of here the same way you walked in you're not going to walk in here with the same baggage that you walked in with i hate to say it brother david but i need more i need more power i need more right here in this here here monitor but you need you you have everything that you have need of you have everything that you have need of to go through this journey and g and paul said that we have this treasure in earthen vessels and jesus would say that out of that belly that he that is a thirst let him come unto me and let him drink for out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water is that right so there is a power that's laying there there's an anointing that is laying there notice it's rivers rivers plural but water water notice it's the same power it's the same anointing it's the same holy spirit it's the same manifestation working through a people out of your belly so young people there's a miracle inside of you there's an anointing on the inside of you there's something on the inside that's got to get out the healing is in the body let it loose there is power in the body let it loose there's a miracle in the body your job is waiting for your manifestation your school is waiting for your manifestation your family is waiting for the manifestation you have this treasure in earth and vessels for out of you will flow the goodness and the grace of god why satan wants to convince you that you that you're not worthy enough because he's scared of the power that you have because he's never tasted he's never had a foretaste of the power that you have now satan's got power and his power is a bluff and he's trying to steer you away from what you are destined to be and what you are called to be but you have walked around that scarecrow and come around here and ate on the true word of god and you set here as an ambassador of almighty god i am an ambassador in bonds with jesus christ i'm an ambassador in what god's called me to do i'm an ambassador when you are an ambassador all the power of that of that nation is behind you if you are an ambassador of the united states all the power of the united states is with you if you're an ambassador of almighty god all of heaven is behind you and we're living in an hour when our hell has been cursed has turned loose but our heaven's been turned loose through you're not on your turf no more devil you have walked onto my tongue and i have come back to take everything that is rightfully mine satan you will regret the day you pointed your sword in his family satan you will regret the day you put cancer on erica parker saying you will regret the day you put depression say you will regret saying you will regret who i am what you tried to stop me from being you're trying to stop my breakthrough you will regret the devil that you were born hallelujah revelation gives you authority and jesus said to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne not on my throne but in my throne and in my throne there is a dominion there is a power and there is a domain and it is a domain that reaches just as far as it boundaries does when joshua was told that this is your land he didn't walk out there and say you know we need to pray about it we need to think about it well it was the same promise that was given to abraham it was the same words and the same boundaries the same land that was given to abraham was the same boundaries that was given to joshua though abraham never made a walk through all of it but if she was going to walk through it and jesus left some work for you to do young people i got scripture to back up what i just said when jesus went up there to the woman at the well all he did after the fact after the fact that she went up there and said come and see a man who has told me all the things of my life is this not the very messiah he went up there and he taught them the word but he never did one miracle you know why i didn't do one miracle brother branham was able to catch into it and said he knew that philip was coming that one day he would go down there to samaria and he would produce the same works he left to work for philip to do over there in samaria i say this to you you have been given a power and you will do the greater works if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be given unto you you've got a power and you've got a job to do you are the people of the commission you are the people of the final voice there's been churches churches and brides brides but there's got to come one that spoke mechanics and the dynamics you have an authority that hell cannot stop hell can't stop you depression can't stop you you remember in the bible there was a woman by the name of joseph bed that she had a prayer meeting and amram and had a prayer meeting and they were seeking a deliverer because there was one that was promised that was coming and joseph bed had had a meeting up there and she realized when she come to a time that moses was the deliverer she'd cut that by a revelation she got that by a revelation that he was the deliverer and that angel i told him told abraham all about all about his days but there had went out a type i typed to kill out all the resurrection to kill out all the deliverance and there went out a type but there was a woman that had caught a revelation that this was the deliverer and there was a king's commission and said you go out there and you drowned all those babies there was a commission that was over top of her but brother branham said she tapped into a revelation he said she tapped into a revelation over in john chapter 11 that i am a resurrection and the life and because she had that revelation and gave her authority to place moses into that bull rush and put him down in that ark and send him out in there in that crocodile infested waters she sent him out there by a revelation because it gave her an authority that i can do this young people you can do this you can send your faith out upon the waters and it'll return to you she's sitting out there on those waters and god was so with her and she tapped into that revelation that i am the resurrection and the life and god dispersed the angel gabriel and said gabriel if he gets in trouble you put his foot you put your foot on the brow of that bull rush and you walk out there you guide him if he gets in a whirlpool you get him out of trouble if a crocodile steps up you put your foot on him i say this if you are getting in trouble he is jehovah's emma [Music] he is jehovah's grandma sister champion over your needs over your life i am jehovah's hammer it means that the lord is there i am with you in your mess i am with you in your trouble i am with you and that same angel of the covenant [Applause] i got an authority i recognize who i am now one time one time let me give you a little bit of a story it's a story don't get fascinated don't get all caught up it's a story but one time there were some animals that were playing a game of football it's a story there's some animals that were playing a game of football and these two teams had come against each other the giraffe and the rhino and the water buffalo on one side of the team and on the other side there was a lion and a tiger and all these other animals and they were going against each other and the team with the rhino they had they had run over top they'd run over top of the team of the line all game long and the score at halftime was 75 to nothing my name was taking they was taking a whooping so so the line went in there and pumped his team up said you know what we can do this we can do this all we got to do is stop that rhino he keeps walking all over top of us he keeps running over top of us all we got to do is stop him if we stop him we can win this if we can stop satan if we can cut him off if we could say sacred to nothing but a bluff you have no power over dutch

power of the living god you won't walk over me but i'll walk over you so they get out there and the lion tells his kicker whatever you do don't kick it to the rhino he'll destroy it he goes out there and sure enough the rhino sure enough the rhino grabs a hold of that ball gets it and he takes off running and he's almost all the way to the end zone he runs over top of the line he runs over top of the tiger and runs over the rest of the tent on that team but he got almost to the end zone and all of a sudden the rhino fell over dead as a doornail i think i watched this last night am i right in saying that you walked all over top of depression am i right in saying that you walked all over top of the enemy that's tried to rob you from being who you are am i talking to the right group this

like i know oh yeah brother andrew i'm the man i cut his head off i help brother i cut cancer off david are you the man nobody else would rise up but i rose up nobody else would do it but i did it nobody else was willing but i was willing there's something powerful about the way that you handle yourself you remember that slave he was in a foreign land but he handled himself you're in lay odyssey but you're not of they ought to see you you go through the struggles but you're not the struggle you go through the pain but you're not the pain hallelujah hallelujah there's something powerful about the way that you handle yourself what is it what is it i got to studying the same thing i wonder is it that camp food they been eating you don't know like i know is he is he sleeping out there in some dorm it's maybe it's a little bit more comfortable for him hey something powerful about the way you handle yourself you could take your slave and you could put him out in a cotton field and he was going to carry himself the same way [Music] and you could take that same slave and put him back there where he was a king's son and he'll carry himself away the same way the only difference is is the way that he was dressed the only difference is the way that he was dressed and the way that he was treated [Applause] oh you don't like what you see you just wait there's some powerful young people about the way that you handle yourself i'm having too much fun with this devil well i'll just go ahead your devil's already your demons already dead can you testify to that the thing that you thought and the thing that you wanted and the thing that the enemy tried to keep you from is already dead you already cast a stone at him he's laying there lifeless but you got something else to do young people [Applause] the bible said there went out a champion but they didn't go back in a champion he's laying there lifeless he's laying there clueless he's laying there has no power so he's powerless he's already dead fear is already dead sickness can't hold you no more it's over it's over but go ahead david lift his head up give a rally to the church of the living god i was there i was the one that swung that stone but i'll be the one that takes his sword david was on a journey one time but he didn't have a sword and when he went into the priest's house said is there a sword here only the sword of that suicide sister esther that tried to keep you bound david said there ain't another sword like it give it to me you talking about using the weapon of the enemy against himself why don't you take cancer and make cancer cut his head off take suicide and make suicide cut his head off there ain't another weapon like it give me the name of jesus that's got the power to break down chairs give me the power to break down guitars it's not the name of william branham it's not the name of the holy church it's the name of jesus christ there ain't another name like the name of jesus what are you doing brother andrew this service today is simply about holding up the devil's head my dad has fought sugar throughout this whole process being on steroids and all kinds of different chemo brother michael it's caused his sugar to go crazy when i watched a man last night walk all over top of that thing but brother joe how do you explain a man that's 600 600 in the blood last night anybody knows what i'm talking about that's crazy high but how do you wake up this morning with perfect blood sugar how do you wake up and tumors are gone how do you wake up and cancer is gone how do you wake up and suicide is calling how do you wake up and depression is gone because you decided that enough is enough i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired satan you didn't make me so you can't break me satan you didn't start me so you can't finish me i am here to finish you off explain the paradox of the young people rising up out of the scripture i can do the work i will be the one if esther walks in to the courts and the king does not extend his scepter to her she's finished because he didn't invite her there she went in there on his owner car on her own accord you had everything stacked up against you abraham to keep you from believing that isaac was going to come forth you had every odd stacked up against you but abraham was not weak in faith [Music] brother andrew you don't know my old story you don't know my old you don't know my old me i don't need to know the old you i didn't come here to hear about your trash and i didn't come here to hear about all the battles that you've been through abraham i really don't care i really don't care that it took you 25 years i don't i really don't care i really don't care how hard you had to battle to get where you got but what i do care is is that god that yet you get that promise that you got the promise abraham you don't know my story brother answer you don't know what i've been through all i know is there's a victory on your way all i know is there's a promised son on your way and it is easter it is the resurrection it is the life it is the truth it is the way [Applause] if the king don't extend his scepter to you you're finished you're finished but not only is esther finished but the whole entire race of the jews sister charity was finished if he doesn't extend his scepter but because there was a plot there was a plot to stop you there was a plot to keep you but there's a plot by almighty god i've watched over them all their life i have kept them i have handled them in my hands and i'll take good care of them you see haman was wanting to destroy you haman was wanting to thrash out all of your lineage and all that what you were but esther had heard a word haman is after you haman is after you young people you have walked into this camp one way and you walk out another way but there's an enemy that has got a target on your back he's gonna say you didn't really get it you really didn't break through you really didn't have it satan has got his eyes on you sister emily did it really happen did you really get something did you really break through because he's wanting to crash out your lineage and the church of the firstborn but esther goes in and because she decides to go in because she was raised for such a time as this she was willing to be a standard she was willing to go in she was willing to go into the king's courts and because she was willing to go in brother nathan she walked in there and the whole entire jew race was completely set free and the gallows that haman had built for mordecai [Applause] if mercy wasn't extended to the gentiles there wouldn't be a race that's called the queen of heaven but because mercy said no haven you are built that gallop for yourself it's time that you hang that depression hang that suicide hang that fear on that gallow you built it for yourself you built your own trap homosexuality i curse you in the name of jesus christ and i hang you up on that gallow not just for our young boys but our young girls pornography i hang you on that gallow i got him right where i want him brother joe i will give you power in my name to cast out devos in my name they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name it's in the name of the most high god [Applause] i'm about to finish because you got something to do right here every year there is a festival of purim and i know you know about it it's a festival of purim and it's a reminder of haman trying to thrash out thrash out and extinguish the whole entire race of the jews but at that feast of purim they take their shoes off and they're right on the bottom of their shoes haman a lot of people don't know us but every service i preach i put cancer on the bottom of that shoe [Music] and a lot of people don't understand what i'm doing i think it's just my makeup it probably is and i'm preaching all the time i'm preaching and don't nobody else know what i know now you know but i'm preaching and those jews dance in that festival [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what are they doing [Applause] what are they doing they are dancing until until until until we're going to run this race until we're not going to lose we're going to win what man has abused what man has tried to hurt god has put a blessing i don't have strength to run it it's not by mighty and it's not my power but by my spirit let me give you let me give you the final there ain't never been a time that i preached and cancer ain't been rubbed off you say well brother andrew that ain't even your battle are you kidding me he's tried to rob my family he's tried to rob my pastor he's right to rob the church of the living god i got a right to dance his name right off the soles of my feet why don't you put your name on the depression of the anxiety of the demon on the bottom of your feet say devil i'm going to dance your name right out of my midst hallelujah oh bless the lord on my soul and forget not all of his benefits where you been at i've been getting my shoes on you've been getting your shoes on ain't you son it's time to walk over top of that devil it's

time go to the marriage supper of the lamb about three and a half years then we're coming back we're going to be right here on this earth we'll have a millennial rain a honeymoon be with the lord jesus for that thousand years of peace then there be the great battles at the end where satan is loose for a short season but not on us our time of temptation and trials is over no more and then they will be gathered to the great white throne judgment but we won't be in the judgment we'll sit with him in the judgment because why here you have passed from death unto life and can come no more into condemnation but you pass from death to life what a wonderful thing amen let's talk to the lord just a moment father we want to commit to you every soul that you have touched every heart that you have softened and moved upon lord lord maybe some of them just got just a little touch of you but lord from that little spark may lord it grow into a mighty flame others lord they have been sanctified in habits of the world sins been dropped off from them others lord have been baptized with the holy ghost the fire of god has come to dwell in them and you've given them power to overcome the world and we thank you for every victory ever everything that you've done we're asking for your grace for your mercies now as we will travel that you'll be with us your hand of grace upon each one even for the food that we'll receive lord we thank you for it now as we will go to part we will just ask for your blessings upon us traveling mercies on the highways as they go back to their churches may they take revival back to their church may there be support in ministry that will just add add to the flame of fire maybe there not be any no not any wet blankets towed on it but each one lord every minister every pastor blow upon the embers upon the fires and add wood to it until it becomes a mighty revival in hearts and lives it's in jesus name we ask it amen i'm going to have you be seated just a little time for instructions first of all i it's something that i wanted to know that you could help me with since you're all seated i i just want to see how many in here that this was your very first time to come to youth camp i want you to stand to your feet your very first time right amen god bless you amen god bless you you can be seated hopefully this won't be your last time unless the lord comes for that great meeting in the air we're so happy that you were here and um you know i i just wanted to remind you of a few things as you know you can go back and listen to these again some of these are will be on facebook and youtube and and uh some archived on eveninglight.net so you know you um just remember it shall be light in the evening time so eveninglight.net and go there and and um you know go back and listen these things you couldn't have got it all amen there's many more things you can receive from it it's very very important to feed your experience on the word of god whatever the lord did for you is wonderful but let's just just say it's the beginning it's not the end you're not going to put a period or even a comma you're going to continue that experience by feeding on the word of god um you know if you if you don't have access to the messages of brother branham you know there's 1100 sermons of them you can you can contact us as elt library at gmail.com or eveninglight.net we'll send you a um sd card with all of them on there and and you can put them on your phone and there's many other websites that you can go to actually and do this and uh you know where that you can have access to every every one of the sermons or you can you can actually you know stream one or you can download that one into your phone but anyway whatever you do feed on the word of god get your bible read the bible amen how many believes the bible oh you do well read it how do you know you believe it if you don't read it how can you show your believe it if you don't read it a lot of christians have never read their bible start somewhere with your experience feed on the word of god do it daily remember we are actually in passover it's not a ceremony that you do once a year like the jews did or the communion you do maybe once a month or however many times you do it at your church it's not it's a communion with the lord is not one once a month or twice a year it's every day with jesus and every day with jesus should be sweeter than the day before so grow in your experience with the lord and and pray call on the name of the lord and uh you know pray in the spirit get in the holy ghost the same holy ghost you you felt right here you can have it in your closet your experience every day every day and i want to stress that to you it's not just just a camp meeting experience and we wait till next year and we have another camp meeting experience and you just go from camp to camp to camp to camp it's more than that it's there where you're feeding daily on the word of god read the bible there's many bible apps biblegateway.com i think you know has a bible apps if you say well i'm not too great at reading well you can get it where you can right there on your on your phones or you get enough junk on it so why not get something good amen praise the lord but there's audio bibles on there and you can listen to them on the audio as you drive to work or you know as you as you stream something even going to school or at home or whatever you know just you know god's given us many tools in our hands we are without excuse when you think about the bible men died to be able to translate it into your language men died even even recently men went to prison in in china just sharing a king james version bible so i i'm not talking about now 200 years 500 years ago they did this and that i'm talking about right now so you know the word of god is precious and it should be very real it's but it's not rare it's not rare precious because we got it in abundance so there's so many supplemental things that you can do um you know so you know that that that has been that's a there when i was when i was a young man to hear i have every single sermon on brother branham's would cost me over ten thousand dollars you say wow that's a lot no that was a lot you know timothy cost me for his hospital bill 300 200 for the doctor so 500 i got a timothy kids were cheap back then but you know now they're they're not so cheap but now what i'm trying to say to you is that kind of gives you an idea but three tape libraries you could own and i'm not joking in in shreveport louisiana you could own a five bedroom house with three baths and a three-car garage in a nice neighborhood a car a truck would cost you three thousand dollars so and that's a brand new ford my dad bought one 1964. three thousand dollars so you know this this is now then a tape library ten thousand dollars you got it free it's available men died to get you a bible you got it free you don't have to die to get it so let's let's read the word of god let's feed on the word of god and feed your experience now we got a lot of people to thank you one thing i want to thank you i want to thank you number one for being one of the best youth groups we've had in the history of this camp you have been marvelous wonderful no trouble nothing we want to thank you for your kindness your love
