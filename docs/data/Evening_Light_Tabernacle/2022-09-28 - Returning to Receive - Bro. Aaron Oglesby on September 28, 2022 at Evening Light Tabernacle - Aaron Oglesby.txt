control of my body my mouth Lord my mind every aspect Lord and speak through me I pray father Lord anoint every heart to receive their portion now as we look into your word I pray you'll bless it Lord in Jesus name we pray you have your Bibles if you will turn with me to the book of Isaiah 44th chapter and the 28th verse once we get going they're going to be quite a number of scripture readings I think they sent you a list of scriptures to try to help out so you may not have the opportunity or time to turn there but I sent a list so maybe we'll build a to keep up be a little bit like a Bible study I guess we'll see Isaiah 44 and 28 we're going to read one verse there and then we're going to look over to Isaiah 45 one verse and then also another verse in Isaiah 45 so we're gonna go I'd like to speak to you for a little bit this evening on returning to receive returning to receive verse 28 it says that saith of Cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to Jerusalem Thou shalt be built and to the temple thy Foundation shall be laid now over in chapter 45 and verse 1 it says thus saith the Lord to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I have Holden to subdue Nations before him and I will loose the loins of Kings to open before him the two lived Gates and the gates shall not be shut and then we're going to skip down to verse 13. it says I have raised him up in righteousness and I will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for Price nor reward saith the Lord of hosts amen you may have your seats this evening foreign what we want to do is we want to take a look at Israel and their captivity in Babylon and the return back to the Homeland as it relates to the church down Through the Ages and her captivity in mystery Babylon we know that Israel oftentimes is used and is a perfect type of the church and last week we looked at the effects that Babylon had on Israel during their 70 years of Exile and how it had affected them and how it had affected even their thinking and we saw that how in an attempt to stay true in what was a good attempt in their hearts in an attempt to practice their religion they began to build synagogues and they began to worship and they began to have a it wasn't like the worship they had in Jerusalem but at least they were doing their best to continue on with the worship as best as they could while they were in that land and I understand that the issue there wasn't with their worship um even though they couldn't fully worship as we would say in spirit and in truth because it wasn't the original Temple worship there even though that even though they couldn't sacrifice in the temple because they were in a Strange Land and the temple had been destroyed they were worshiping as best they could with what they had so they were given it everything and they were worshiping to the best of their ability the issue came when there was an opportunity for them to go back there was nothing wrong with worshiping the way they worshiped as long as that was the best they had as long as that was all the light that was shining on the word at that time there was nothing wrong with that worship but when it came time to move the issue came when the opportunity to go back to the original was presented to the people they no longer saw the need to be restored back they had settled into their religion they had settled in right where they were they had grown accustomed to a little bit of Babylon being mixed in with their religion they didn't see the need for an Acts 2 38 experience anymore they didn't see the need for an acts 4 experience they just believed on the Lord or or they believed that God sent a prophet and they figured they could stay right where they were and they were going to be okay because they had settled in where they were at but God had provided a way to go back and if God says go back if God says to Rich turn that I want to tell you tonight you should return whatever it is God's telling you to do wherever he's sending you wherever he's leading you even if it doesn't make sense to you even if it's the harder way if he says do it I recommend to you tonight that you do it if he lays that opportunity before you now now as we looked at this our opening scripture I opened the scripture to me they're so amazing in in the fact that it's Isaiah and he's prophesying of one who's going to come and God is going to use him to return Israel home again and what you have to realize is Isaiah is writing this more than a hundred years before Cyrus ever comes to the throne this is more like 140 years before he ever comes to the throne this is before he's ever been born or ever even been thought of and Isaiah writes in 45 1 thus saith the Lord to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I have hold him to subdue Nations before him and I will loose the loins of the Kings to open before him the two lead gates in the gate shall not be shut verse 13. I have raised him up in righteousness I will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives now as we know because we read it last week in in the first chapter of Ezra in the first year of Cyrus's Reign he does exactly these things he comes in and he loses them and he begins to fulfill prophecy listen what I want us to get tonight is that God does things the way God wants to do things okay it doesn't have to be how you expect it to be when you expect it to be or through the person that you expect it to come through right God is in control no matter what you think tonight quit fussing about who the president is quit fussing about politics quit worrying about this and all the world affairs they are doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing they are nothing more than Pawns in the hands of God God chose Cyrus God chose Sorrows he was a pagan polytheistic King of Persia who was out to conquer the world and God says that's my anointed one I have raised him up in righteousness I'm directing all his ways he's gonna build my city he's gonna lose my captives Cyrus Cyrus is a murderer he's killing everybody he's Conquering the world he's he's polytheistic he's a pagan but in this God knew who to let come into control because being polytheistic what Cyrus believed was as many gods as I can get looking on me favorably the better so when he takes over and he's like wait they destroyed your temple well we got to fix that I can't have this God angry with me I can't have him mad at me I want my kingdom to prosper go back go back go fix this mess before the god takes out his wrath on me and so God allows him to come into this place and and God does it how he wants to do it well surely some great deliverer is going to rise up like Moses did surely one of our Brethren is going to rise up surely one of the priests who used to sacrifice in the original Temple God is going to use him nope Cyrus God's gonna do things the way he wants to do things these people are going to be delivered the way God wants to deliver them listen in the problems that you're going through in the situation that you're facing God is going to deliver you in the way that he wants to deliver you don't get it in your mind how it's going to work I'm going to work out just say God I trust you in whichever Avenue you open to me I'm gonna take that Avenue because so many times we get it in our mind how things are going to be and it causes us to miss what it is we're supposed to receive listen Jesus came the way God wanted him to not the way they expected him to and because of this so many people missed him so many people couldn't receive him this message came how God wanted this message to come oh surely it's going to come through some great University some great organization some great doctor of divinity nope William Branham God chose the messenger god picked who he wanted to deliver it through and the message was delivered exactly the way God wanted it to be delivered to a people he knew could receive it in that way don't listen to it or hear you go I wish he'd have said this or I wish he'd done that mile I couldn't have been this way it came exactly the way God wanted it to come to deliver the people that God wanted to deliver in this last day yeah God sent the message and it was delivered exactly how he wanted it to be delivered and it also was foretold as we know in Malachi 4 5-6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children in the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse here what we see is prophesied is an opportunity to go back just like was given to the children of Israel an opportunity to return to the original an opportunity here to return to the land of the word to return to the faith of the original fathers now the church had need to go back because they themselves had found themselves captured and then exiled down in Babylon just like Israel had been the church had started free and full of power right there in Jerusalem free they operated to Mark 16. according to John 14 12 according to James 5 there were no claims on the church such as false doctrines or Trinity doctrines or false baptisms the doctrines and the Deeds of the Nicolaitans had not yet taken hold and so this church was free of any claim of the enemy and they operated in a way where the spirit moved freely where the spirit fell on people and they received it and and we know how it would cause them to act there was tongues and there was gifts and there was healings that's how the first church operated and they were the pattern they were the original they are the standard so many people get uncomfortable when you say that but the prophet of God said Pentecost was our pattern no one will have to say but what the church was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost he goes on to say this what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church age is close he says the true church will always try to be like the original Pentecost there's a lot of people that obviously have never read that the true church will try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one brother Branham here makes it very clear what we are to return to and what we are to act like what you are to return to and what this church is to be like but what was it that happened to that church why is it that there's a need for a return why isn't it that it didn't stay right where it was down Through the Ages the same thing happened to them that had happened to Israel they left their first love they followed after other gods they began to drift and allow the ideas of man to enter into the church and these next few quotes all come from from the Ephesian Church age he says the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word The Cry of reaching out in the spirit all began to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become a bit formal he says what can this mean but the day would come when the vested clergy by political maneuvering and the substitution of word and spirit for Creeds and dogmas and human leadership would enslave the laity notice the wording used there it would enslave the laity while the leaders luxuriated in ill-gotten wealth he said the second generation coming on was just like Israel they demanded a king to be like other nations when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway this is the history of the church he said they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with the form but the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes is about all that is left he said but as usual people don't heed God's warning that Revival fire built upon the sacred word is so wonderful and the manifestation of the spirit is so blessed that a little fear Creeps in and Whispers in the heart and says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on now notice how slick the enemy is none of this sounds bad at all I think it's a great idea that we shouldn't let the Revival die down I think it's a great idea to protect the truth I believe we should fight for the truth these are all things that seem very reasonable he says what can we do to see the Revival go on that is when the Antichrist Spirit comes in and Whispers look you have the truth now see that it doesn't get lost that's Antichrist you have the word make sure it doesn't get lost just focus on that part of it don't worry about the other aspects that are needed just focus on one part make sure it don't get lost make sure that you get you get this and right here is where the Exile or the capture takes place right here is where the church goes down into Babylon there the very moment that that first move of God organized they were in Babylon that very moment they were captured and the devil is so slick that he uses the fear of losing the truth to ensnare you think about this and even as the church begins its Journey even once there was some freedom from Rome and even as people began to come back to the unfolding of the word and their Journey from Babylon back to the Homeland begins even as they become back from exile to a restored truth even as God would send Messengers down Through the Ages that Spirit kept on working to keep people from going all the way back oh sure yeah you've come out of Babylon You Broke Free from that Roman system but this is for protect this truth you have protect this truth right here even as they left Rome or even as they left Babylon if he could get them with that same denominational mindset then he still had a claim on them he would still have a claim on if he could get the church from being completely free and completely restored if he could use the fear of losing truth to do it that's how he would ensnare the people how do you mean so brother Aaron look the revelation of justification was so special it brought such a freedom and they said we can't lose this we can't lose this truth this is a wonderful truth that has loosed us from the bounds of Catholicism and yet they walled up so tight around it to protect it that when justification came they couldn't move on to it and they had been snared by the truth no no the truth liberates you not everybody the truth snares some people and they're snared by the truth and they can't go on to the next truth but those who did those who fought through that they see a true sanctification and they get the a holy life a true Bible sanctification and then the restoration of the gifts come but they're so walled up that they can't move on and accept the the restoration of their gifts and then those see that and it's such a special thing and it's such a powerful thing and they get so walled up that they can't move on to anything other than tongues and they're walled up right there snared by a truth not able to move beyond the truth and they're bound up with the same denominational mindset God sent a prophet it's a truth a truth you must see and yet they get so walled up with God sent a prophet that they can't even move on into the message that the prophet brought they're snared by God sent a prophet and they're stuck right there and they can't even move on into what was opened up to them so walled up in Traditions to our message people have has more Traditions than any of the denominations we've ever preached about message people are the most traditional people on the face of the earth I believe snared not able to move on into the opening of the word because it's just this portion or it's just this part and Babylon still holds a claim on them because they're under the spirit of denomination it's the same chain that has grabbed a hold of every age to where his brother Brown would say the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit gone oh they kept on with the form of godliness but the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes is about all that is left but that's not everybody there is a people who are determined in their hearts I'm going all the way back I'm not going to stop short they're refusing to stop short of all the way because they recognize what all of this has been for God didn't send a prophet in order to send a prophet God sent a prophet to gather abroad to gather and elect to take them back to the Homeland to take them back to the faith to put them back in the original place where he started the church they recognized I can't stop short of that I can't stop short of that it's a return to where and how our fathers worshiped the original faith in the homeland of the word and we refuse to stop anywhere along the journey remember you might come up to something that's very good say justification but that's not the stopping point that's just on the way sanctification is wonderful but it's on the way the gifts is wonderful but that's on the way God sent a prophet that's wonderful but it's on the way you can't stop there you got to keep going all the way all the way back Jeremiah prophesied they would return back to the land of their fathers the land of Abraham Isaac and Jacob in Jeremiah 29 10 he said for thus saith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you and causing you to return to this place the same thing was prophesied with Malachi concerning the church prophesied that one would come and turn our hearts back to the faith or the land of Peter of Paul of Stephen back to the land of the original but by but by getting away from their first love the church found themselves in captivity prophets and servants had kept hope alive for a full return to the land Malachi prophesied Joel prophesied I will restore there were prophets along the way that kept hope survives that one day we can come out of this one day we can be returned back one day and God sent men down through the ages to keep Faith alive that one day would come a full return just like he had sent prophets to Babylon to let them know one day there's going to be a return the church held out hope the church looked for it the church longed for it the church wanted to be free but then finally the return comes it's time to go back now let's go back as we go back and forth through this just keep in mind that we may be interchanging Israel in the church Israel in the church because we're dealing with the same thing the time came to leave Babylon and go back to Jerusalem the time came to return back to the Homeland to return back to the original faith the prophet came said it's time to go back it's time to rebuild a prophet comes on the scene with a message from the King he's declaring Bible Truth Bible doctrines returned to Pentecost you must have the token only to find that most Christians had no desire to go back only to find that most Christians were pretty comfortable in their religion in Babylon they had settled down to where they were comfortable they had got comfortable in Babylon they didn't really want Bible holiness they liked wearing their Babylonian garments they didn't really want true Bible sanctification they liked having some of their Babylonian habits they wanted to say I'm still saved but I still want to partake of this and I still want to wear that they were comfortable in Babylon they did not want to return they wanted a form of godliness that's what they wanted a form of God is they were comfortable with worldly comfort with worldly entertainment most didn't see the need why do I need to go back why must I do that they had their religion they could hold their religion and they could hold on to the world too so why do I got to do this but the king had decreed that we could go back this is the decree of the king we can rebuild the Temple we can have the same worship our fathers had but why do I need that I'm comfortable just coming on Sunday singing a couple I'm comfortable living the life I'm living to do this is going to get me out of my comfort zone some of us need to get out of our comfort zone our comfort zones for a lot of us are leading us to a state of lukewarmness all right it's easy to get comfortable and fall asleep get uncomfortable step out of your Comforts don't say God move in my life do whatever you need to do to wake me up to shake me to make sure I'm prepared for the Return of the King we have the opportunity to go back to the faith and to the worship that the father's had we can rebuild the walls and have the same protection of the word that they had and just like in Ezra some came out you're proof of it some came out some heard the call come out of her my people and they heard the call and they said I'm not comfortable here and some began the journey to go back and some came out and we know that around 42 000 came out of Babylon around this time I dropped in the bucket a mere five to ten percent of those that happen to be in captivity why didn't more come out why didn't Moore leave how could they see the Vindication of the Prophet night after night after night and see thus saith the Lord night after night see discernment night after night and never fail and go I think I'll stay right here in in Babylon listen if one percent of the people that witnessed the ministry of the Prophet had come out there wouldn't be an empty seat in this building just the ones that witnessed it in Louisiana but they witnessed the Vindicated power of God and said I'm comfortable right here with my religion I don't need to go back to Pentecost I don't need to return to the original I don't need to go back and rebuild the Temple I'm good right where I'm at how could the how could they declare Bible days are here again they declared Bible days are here again but I'm gonna stay right here Bible days are here why are you here and others aren't why did you come out why did your parents come out what stirred you why are you sitting here tonight returned back Ezra one and five this is after the decree where the king says if any man will go it says then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites with all of them whose Spirit God had raised to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem it's no accident you're here tonight it's no accident Your Heart Was Heard God moved on your heart God called you God said you're going back he set your mind he said you you you and he moved on your heart it's not by accident that they went back it's no accident your heart has been turned back to the fathers it's no accident that you want to be completely free of Babylon it says the spirit of God raised you up the spirit of God took you out of Babylon the spirit of God placed you where you are tonight you have been called to go back home you have been called to go back to the original there was something burning in the hearts of those forty two thousand you know what it feels like there was something burned in their hearts I can't stay here I know I have a good life I know we have some truth I know we have some church but I just can't stay here I gotta take another step I got to go further I got to go back to the land of the fathers I got to go back how it was that the original I want to worship the way they worship them the temple I want it rebuilt I want it restored I want to see Jerusalem built back up I've got to go back I've got to return something burning in their hearts we've got to get back we have to go back to the faith of the fathers there's a work that I have to do there's a work we have to do I can't be stopped I won't be stopped I won't stop short something's driving me back something's pushing me brother Daryl I can't stop today I got to go a little further tomorrow I can't give up even though others have quit even though others have stayed back I gotta go others say I don't need to go that's okay but I'm going I don't I don't see the reason it's okay something within me says go back get back in that place rebuild it prepare Jerusalem the return in the rebuilding restored the worship that the fathers had had not the version of worship that they had practiced in Babylon come on Church we shouldn't be practicing the same kind of worship they're practicing in Babylon it should be a different kind of worship it should be a restored worship it should be a return worship their hearts were turned to the faith of their fathers by the moving of the spirit I will restore saith the Lord and what's awesome about this is the king begins to give back that does my heart good man all that was stolen through the years of Babylonian captivity all the years that the church was stuck under Roman rule all the years that they were stuck there in mystery Babylon Ezra one and seven also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put them in the house of his gods notice these are things stolen from the original place of worship for the worship of false gods and King Cyrus goes now this don't belong here this needs to be put back even those did Cyrus King of Persia bring forth by the hand of mystery death the treasurer and numbered them unto chest Bazaar the prince of Judah and this is the number of them 30 Chargers of gold a thousand Chargers of silver nine and twenty knives 30 basins of gold silver basins of a second sort 410 and other vessels a thousand all the vessels of gold and silver were 5 400. all these the chest Bazaar bring up with them of the Captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem the king says these things still belong in the house of God come on Church these things still belong this was taken from the church down in Babylon these doctrines were robbed from the church when they were down in Babylon true baptism put it back God had put it back serpent seed put it back eternal security put it back put them back where they belong this doesn't belong here put it back in the house of God the Supernatural is robbed put it back the gifts have been brought from the church take them back put them back in their worship back to the original worship the freedom of worship has been railed from the people given God give them back their worship give them back their freedom give it back to them they won't be robbed anymore this belongs to them give it back he says this doesn't belong to me this is God's and the King says you can have it back tonight [Applause] oh and this that the canker worm took and this that the Palmer worm took here are the gifts of the Spirit put them back in the worship these blessings belong to you and the king decrees take these things back and put them in the worship where they belong in order to worship like they did at the original you're going to need these things because if you go back and build a temple and you have all the form of godliness but you don't have these things it ain't the original worship you haven't returned Hallelujah and as the work begins and progresses and there's no way for me to go into the depths of a lot of these things so we're going to go best we can even though they're a small group even though they're a hated group even though there's opposition to them on every hand nobody wants to see this Temple rebuild nobody wants to see these walls rebuilt there's opposition but the king keeps providing for them every step of the way Ezra 3 7 they gave money also to the Masons and to the Carpenters and meet and drink and all unto them of Zidane and to them of Tire to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the Sea of Joppa according to the grant that they had of Cyrus King of Persia listen when you're on this journey this is the King's journey and he says I'm going to provide everything you have need of you're trying to get back to the original I'll pay the wages I'll provide the materials I'll give you the blessings I'll give you the faith I'll give you the strength I'll give you everything you have need of in this journey the king is supplying everything you have need of along this journey you don't gotta worry you ain't gonna want you ain't gonna come up short you're not gonna stop I can't stop he's pouring strength in he's pouring faith in he's pouring overcoming power in he's giving me everything I need to get all the way back but it Brown says but God protected them and they had forgotten it how quickly our Pentecostal Believers are forgetting that you were saved by his grace filled with his spirit in this great tremendous dying time to the church don't forget that that God that give you the Holy Spirit to live by and to make this journey is with you every step of the way the journey that we're on is a Vindicated Journey and it's been Vindicated by an edict from the King and when the king sends you on a mission he's going to provide you with everything that you have need of to be successful because once he signs off on it it ain't your mission it's his mission it's the king's Mission with the King Signet and he don't want it to fail he's not going to let it fail but quit listening to the devil quit listening to all the naysayers and the well you're not going to make it you just don't have enough this is the King's work this is the King's edict this is the King's return I can't not make it the king is walking with me every step of the way providing for me every step of the way everything you have need of he will supply you right on time brother Branham says in Christ is our Variety Store I like that by one Spirit we're all baptized into one big Variety Store amen anything you have need of he will supply it if I need healing I'll take it if I need Joy I'll take it if I need Victory I'll take it it's all hanging around in God's big Variety Store and and I am possession and you have possession of everything in that Variety Store when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost Amen brother you talk about Elbow Room let's take over you need healing there it is setting for you just reach over and get it you might have to kick over a few things here and there to get it but what about church order just kick some things over and get what you need tonight we'll stand it back up we'll put it back in place he says you got to kick some things over to get what you need just go get it we need healing it's setting for you you might have to kick over a few things to get it push you a few things to get it but go ahead and take it you might have to get a ladder and reach up for it but God's got a ladder there if you're interested in getting it now see that's where a lot of people are they want it they say they do but it's just Out Of Reach well I guess I can't have it they got to kick over a few things they come no no no that ain't my nature it's not in my nature to do that that's why we preach a nature change listen I don't know that it's in anybody's nature to act the way they acted on the day of Pentecost nobody just wakes up and just goes stumbling around acting drunk why are you doing that this is just my nature it's about laying your nature down it's about saying whatever I got to do to get it I'm going to get it I don't care what anybody says I don't care what anybody calls me I don't care how I don't care how I look I don't care if it's completely out of my comfort zone I'm going to get it oh I need a ladder to get it oh I'm sorry you're gonna have to wait on the ladder I need it right now I'm taking the ladder and I'm going to get it I'm going to do whatever I gotta do to get it it's in the store it's paid for it don't walk away cause you can't quite reach it don't give up fight for it tonight do whatever you got to do to get it even though the majority of folks are staying in Babylon there's a drive in these people we must rebuild Jerusalem we must rebuild the city we must rebuild the Temple the wall it must be rebuilt there must be a restoration and with edicts from the king with everything they need provided by the king they return and they begin to work they begin to rebuild and as they return to the original worship and to the original faith it could not be mixed with other worships excuse me it couldn't be mixed with the Theology of man it couldn't be polluted with Babylon it had to be free from denomination it has to be pure worship as it was at the beginning in spirit and in truth Ezra 4 1 . now when the adversaries notice this is the key word the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the Captivity Bill did the temple unto the Lord God of Israel then they came to zerubul and to the chief of the fathers and said unto them let us build with you man awesome help who doesn't want help everybody would like some help I mean it would be rude and unchristian-like to turn down their help let us build with you for we seek your God these people want to be saved remember they're adversaries we seek your God as you do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Essa Hardin king of Asser which brought us up hither it's very reasonable but remember I'm gonna say it adversaries sure brother Brown and we'll support you we'll help you just knock off the women a little bit oh we'd love to be a help to you well we'll even get behind you and support this campaign just quit preaching that serpent seed so much but we want to help you we want to get the message out there we want to serve God just like you we'll we'll support this campaign but make sure you don't you know preach about the invisible Union or anything like that it couldn't be mixed the word adversary here means oppress or press someone hard prior to the Jews returning from Exile these people had been the rulers and people of the area and now they are resenting losing the power of the region they don't want to lose their people and so they offer a hand let me help but reservable verse 3 and Joshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said unto them you have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel as king Cyrus the King of Persia hath commanded us the king told us to return the king commanded us to build a temple the edict told me to take the land so the Samaritan's generous offer to help with the construction is actually a very thinly veiled plot to retain control and influence because if the Jewish leaders accept their help then the worship of Yahweh will be corrupted by mixture with Pagan practices well you can't keep us from doing that we helped you build this we can sacrifice here too we helped you build this and so they say no no no you'll have no hand in this it must be a pure unadulterated word it must be pure original faith of the fathers and when they find here no compromise when the Samaritans find that that these are going to stay true to the King's Command no matter what the pressure then instead of offering help they turn and they begin to try to hinder it verse 4 then the people of the land weaken the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus King of Persia even until the reign of Darius King of Persia and in the reign of a hazarus the beginning of his Reign wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem so here their stand for truth comes at a cost one thing you can be sure of is that you're going to face opposition in the return as you preach a return you're going to face opposition when you practice that return you're gonna face mocking and opposition the enemy who doesn't want to see you back in the Homeland is going to oppose you he doesn't want to deal with the power of God once again in the church he don't want to deal with the book of Acts church again walking on the face of the Earth he doesn't want the people to return to where they need to be in order to receive the promise so he mocks and he hinders and he laughs and he raises an opposition in the restoration and he tries to stop the work because I want to put it simply because he knows how to read sure he does he knows what the prophecies say he knows where Israel is going to be blessed he knows where the Fulfillment of Prophecy is supposed to take place it's come stuck in Babylon he needs you hanging on to your denominational ideas he needs them Bound by Traditions he doesn't need Jerusalem to be rebuilt he can't have a people turned back to that original Faith he knows what that original Faith did to him when he had to face it two thousand years ago he knows what that faith will do so he tries to hinder so he fights it and he discourages it and he brings false accusations we're going to skip books here for a minute and go over into Nehemiah because they also had made an early and it's all kind of part of the same restoration the rebuilding of Jerusalem Nehemiah is more about the building of the wall where Ezra is more about the rebuilding of the Temple but in Nehemiah 2 19. it says but when sand ballot and her and I and tobiah the servant the ammonite and guesstimate the Arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn you're going back to their ritual Pentecostals oh that jumping shot they left us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that you do will you rebel against the king listen when things began to get brought back to what they once were those that don't want to see it returned will scoff at it they will make fun of it because they don't want it to be returned there because they don't want to have to return themselves so they don't want to see it built up Nehemiah 4 1 but it came to pass that when Sam Ballard heard that we builded the wall he was Roth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews Nehemiah 6 6 wherein was written it is reported among the Heathen and gas smooth saith that thou and the Jews think to Rebel for which cause thou buildeth the wall that thou mayest be their King according to these words you know this struck me here is a minister a prophet on a mission from the King doing what the King has asked him to do and he's accused of Kingdom building you're building this wall so you can have your own kingdom you're doing this just to be different so you can rebel against the king you know why I said that anybody that hangs out with Timothy should know because he's stupid he's on a mission doing what the king told him to do Nehemiah isn't worried about these accusations he isn't worried about the mocking he isn't worried about any of this because he has an edict from the King go rebuild the wall the wall must be rebuilt that's what the king told him to do go back to Nehemiah 2 and 7 moreover I said unto the king if it pleased the king let letters be given to me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till I come into Judah in a letter unto ASAP The Keeper of the king's force that he may give me Timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which app pertained to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter in and the King granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me it doesn't matter what the critics say it doesn't matter what the devil says it doesn't matter what those who don't want to return say we have the authority of the king to return He said go back and take what you need and be successful and overcome and go back to the faith of the fathers and build up that Foundation go back we have an edict from the King the king says I want it restored I want my church the way she was build her back up I want you to return to the Pentecost of Jerusalem and I've got a message from the King to prove it prophet of God would say the holy spirit is in the church to swing the faith back again to the original faith that's right for he will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers the first time he turned the heart of the fathers to the children this time the hearts of the children to the father see taking the faith that the fathers had and placed it over here on the children the one that's just then coming in and this time he's going to take the same Faith because they got away from the original faith and he's going to turn the faith of the fathers and the children back to the fathers the Pentecostal fathers another acts 2. that's right another one he says foreign what is this this is the king decreeing and writing an edict you can have exactly what they had on the day of Pentecost you can have exactly what they had in the book of Acts the king issued an edict and said rebuild the wall rebuild the Temple get Jerusalem ready and Ezra now having turned down the help of the hybridized religion now faces their attacks as they try to Hinder and Cyrus is no longer on the throne and for a time a new king is ruling and they begin to write letters unto him negative letters and we have a lot of scriptures to read as we go so I hope that's okay Ezra 4 12 be it known unto the king that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem building the re the rebellious and the bad City and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations be it known now unto the king that if this city be building and the walls set up again then will they not pay toll tributes and customs and so Thou shalt and damage the revenue of the Kings verse 15. he tells them that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers they say go back and look in the records of your fathers and see if it's not true that these people are rebellious people that they're going to cause trouble for you it says search in the book of the records of thy father so that thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious City and hurtful unto Kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time for which cause was this city destroyed they tell the king that if this work continues these people are going to cause trouble yes Lord these people are going to cause trouble look in the records and see if they weren't once rebellious look in the records and see if they weren't sinners look in the records and see if they haven't failed time and time again look at their past look at their past now they claim to be free now they claim to be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost King search it out who are they to rebuild anything this is the same church that fell away and caused all the trouble and for a time it works for a time that causes the work on the temple to cease as a search is made and listen all the things they said were true I was a failure I was a sinner I did horrible things all those things are 100 true but that fact didn't change the truth of the matter that the King has given and edict the king said I can go free the king said that I could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the king said that my sins would be forgotten there was an edict that the king said I didn't have to live under that condemnation anymore but as the king searches and he finds that some of these things are are true sure the church had fallen yes the Church of the ages had failed Pentecost had failed worship wasn't being done in spiritual in spirit and truth but that didn't stop the fact that the king had written and edict and said restore I will restore build it back up build the temple the king said you're forgiven none of that changed that the king said you can have whatever you need to finish the job and so we moved to Ezra five and one and in this time what God does in in the time of trouble is he raises up a prophet and he raises up a prophet and said then the prophets and the prophet the prophet in Zechariah the son of Edo prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the god of Israel even unto them then rose up zerubbabel the son of shittiel and Joshua the son of Joseph and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem and with them were the prophets of God helping them in response to the enemy trying to stop the restoration God raises up a prophet just when it seems like all denominations have failed God raises up a prophet just when it seems like we can't go forward God raises up a prophet and these people take the message and they continue building they take the message of the prophet and they are encouraged and they continue to build they said listen we didn't come back here to worship like we're in Babylon we didn't come back here to live a denominational life we didn't come back here to stop short we came back here to finish the job we came back here to go over away we came back to restore Worship in the faith of the original fathers we didn't come back to settle for what they got in Babylon I haven't come this far to stop short I'm going all the way back and I'm gonna restore what God Said to restore rebuild rebuild rebuild it didn't matter what the critics said we're going back to Pentecost the devil didn't like that one so once again he raises up naysayers says who Do You Think You Are chapter 5 verse 3. at the same time came to them tight and I governor of this side of the river and shethar bosni and their Companions and said thus unto them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall and once again they write to the king a negative report this will be a rather long reading stick with me Ezra 5 and 8. be it known unto the king that we went into the province of Judea to the house of the great God which is builded with great stones and Timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on Hallelujah and prospereth in their hands then ask we those elders and said unto them who commanded you to build this house and to make up these walls we ask their names also to certify thee that we might write their names of the men and we're the chief of them the men that were the chief of them and thus they returned us answer saying we are the Servants of the god of Heaven and Earth and build the house that was builted these many years ago which a great king of Israel builded and set up but after that our fathers had provoked the god of Heaven under wrath and he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon the Chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the people away into Babylon but in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same King Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God and the vest was also of gold and silver of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought them into the Temple of Babylon those that Tyrus the king take out of the Temple of Babylon and they were delivered unto one whose name was just bizarre whom he had made governor and said unto him take these vessels go carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem and let the house of God be builded in this place then came the same chest Bazaar and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem and since that time even until now hath it been in building and yet it is not finished now therefore if it seemed good to the king let there be a search made in the king's Treasure House which is there at Babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build the house of God at Jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning the matter I would like you to search the records O King to see if these people really are supposed to return to Pentecost I'd like you to go through the scriptures and see if that's really what these people are supposed to do trying to restore this worship trying to restore this and build this back up I'd like you to look and see if they really have a right to do this verse 6. then Darius the king made a decree and a search was made in the house of the Rose where the treasures were laid up in Babylon and there was found at acmetha in the palace that is in the province of the medes a role and therein was a record thus written in the first year of Cyrus the King the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem let the house be building the place where they offered sacrifices and let the foundation thereof be laid and the height thereof three score cubits and the breadth thereof three score cubits with three rows of great stones in a row of new Timber and let the expenses be given out of the King's house I'm gonna pay for it I'm gonna give it to him I'm gonna restore they ain't gonna have to do nothing the king's gonna provide hey man it's in the king's record it's in the king's record you have every right it's in the king's records Hallelujah and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem and brought unto Babylon be restored and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem every one to his place those things are supposed to be there it's their place and place them in the house of God now therefore it's hat now the governor beyond the river shut the Zone I don't try that one again and your companions which are beyond the river be ye far from fence get away from these people leave these people alone they're doing the king's work let the work of this house of God alone let the governor of the Jews and the Elders of the Jew build this house of God in his place moreover I make a decree what you shall do to the Elders of thee Jews for the building of this house of God that of the king's Goods even of the tribute beyond the river forth with expenses be given unto these men that they be not hindered pay them wages pay on to do this in that which they have need of both young bullets and Rams and Lambs for the burnt offerings of God of Heaven wheat salt wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are Jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail Lord I need you today here's some I need you day by day day by day day by day without fail he'll give you what you need every

fail hallelujah hallelujah that they may offer sacrifices as sweet Savers unto the god of heaven and pray for the life of the king and of his sons also I've made a decree I'm gonna let y'all be seated if you're just me I'm sorry I'm trying so hard come on that whosoever shall alter this word let Timber be pulled down from his house and be set up and let him be hanged there on and let his house be made a dung Hill for this and the god that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all Kings and people Thou shalt put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem I Darius have made a decree let it be done with speed you want to stop this restoration you want to stop this move of God you want to stop the restoration of the Bride you can't do it it's the king's word it's the king's Eden he has declared that we can restore that we can return that we can go back if you got a problem with it take it up with the King let's do a search of the records tonight let's look through the records tonight oh you shouldn't be dancing in the church who gave you the right to do that well I say let there be a search mate I say let there be a search mate Psalms 149 and

signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues it's in the records it's written in the records you have a right to it well we don't believe in Divine Heating and healing anymore well according to the king's edict you about to be really disappointed because if you'll go over here and search the records and go to James 5 13 it says as any among you Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with all in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven of him it's in the records it's an edict you have a right to

this I want to finish it y'all forgive me father dear we sometimes we get happy and we just really act like a bunch of children guilty but it's because we're free we're not under the bondage of evil or Traditions or any certain thing of the elders we're just free in the Holy Spirit and we can sing and worship you and fellowship around the word and enjoy ourselves to that we might praise the almighty God oh after seeing all the chaos of formal religions and all the kinds of idol worship and to think that you were so good to me that let you let me know you in the power of your resurrection and to be able to tell others about it we're so happy this is the King's Commission this isn't by man this is mandated by the king I'm gonna skip a few things to get to this ending there may be few helping and many opposing but tonight the battle is the Lord's it's the king's edict he said not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord this was actually a prophecy to zerubbabel as he's trying to get this done he sees himself right he said this ain't gonna be done by power or might it's going to be done by my spirit the original worship is going to be returned by my spirit and brother Randall comes along and says the bride won't be put in her place by military force but by my spirit saith the Lord the bride's going to be placed back in the original by his spirit now not everyone returned only the ones that God had moved upon their hearts but the ones who returned came back because they wanted to worship Jehovah and they wanted to be where God had called them to be they had to be where God had called them to be there was something moving them back something calling come out of her my people something turning their hearts back what was it because even just like today something's drawing them back they take their Elias what is it they got to be in the Homeland for something what is it why do we got to go back why do we have to go back Israel had to be established the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem Micah 5 2 but thou Bethlehem euphrita though thou be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of these shall come forth unto me that is to be the ruler in Israel whose going forth have been from old from Everlasting you see right here that Israel had to be established it had to be their Bethlehem had to be there Israel had to be in her Homeland Jerusalem had to be rebuilt there was a promised Messiah to come there Zechariah 9 9 Rejoice greatly o Daughters of Zion shout o daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a cult the foal of an ass they had to return in order to receive they had to be where he was going to come to prophecy had to be fulfilled and even if they didn't know why they were driven they had a will to work they had a mind to work they had to be there things had to be ready they built a wall in just a matter of days they worked they worked opposition came they worked well I don't know we're driven we got to get back we got to get back to the original we got to get the faith restored something has to be and they worked and they built and they tried to get back to what the original was but when they got it all laid out in Ezra 3 and 12 it says many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first temple when the foundation of this house was laid Before Their Eyes they wept with a loud voice they felt like they had failed they felt like it didn't compare they felt like they had fallen short two and one in the seventh month in the one and twentieth day of the month came the word of the Lord by the prophet haggai sang speak now to desirable the son of shatiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of Joseph the high priest and to the residue of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first Glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing it doesn't even compare we work so hard we're still standing we're still fighting we tried to get back to the original we tried to be just like that first stage we tried to get the foundation exactly how it was but it didn't have the Ark in it it didn't have the urine with thumbing it didn't have the fire that fell and filled the temple and started looking at it going what have we done yet now be strong he turns and he begins to encourage those are rubable saith the Lord and be strong o Joshua son of Joe sedek the high priest and be strong all you people of the lands hate the Lord and work for I Am with You saith the Lord of hosts according to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth with you fear not for thus saith the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all the nations shall come and I will fill this house with Glory say the Lord of hosts what's he saying to him it's just a little wall and you're going to have the Messiah here just a little while and the Messiah is going to be here and he's going to shake the Nations he's going to be the desire of the Nations just a little while and the Messiah is going to be here verse 8 the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the Lord of hosts in other words don't be concerned that this Temple don't have silver in Gold that all belongs to me anyway the glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former saith the Lord and in this place will I give peace saith the Lord of hosts don't be concerned about the silver and gold but this house is going to exceed the first house because the presence of the very Messiah is going to walk in this house the Messiah is going to be dedicated in this Temple the Messiah is going to teach in this Temple the Messiah is going to drive out the money changers in this Temple his presence is going to be the glory of it it's going to be his coming that is the glory of it the temple had to be restored the rebuilding of Jerusalem was for the coming of the king and we look around
