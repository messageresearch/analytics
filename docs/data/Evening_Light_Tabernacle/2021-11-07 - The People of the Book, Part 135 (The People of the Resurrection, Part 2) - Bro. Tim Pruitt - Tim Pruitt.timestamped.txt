[22:02] come back
[22:04] some of us may be going through certain
[22:06] situations in life or difficulties and
[22:08] yet but god
[22:09] sends a reminder this wednesday night
[22:11] brother timothy you didn't know this but
[22:13] brother michael through the song
[22:15] god spoke to my heart because i've been
[22:17] kind of dealing with some situations
[22:19] there on the job and
[22:20] when i got that that message god does
[22:22] impossible math
[22:24] two fishes and five loaves
[22:27] it's our part it's our opportunity
[22:30] it's our responsibility to bring the
[22:31] fish in the loaves is his to multiply
[22:35] and i say that today because
[22:37] things get tough but yet it's
[22:39] our responsibility to provide the fish
[22:41] and the loaves
[22:43] he's going to do the miraculous
[22:45] he's going to do the impossible
[22:47] because he's still god and not only did
[22:49] they bring that scripture out and that
[22:51] thought out during the song one of the
[22:53] songs brother michael was saying but
[22:54] also brother timothy brought out so god
[22:56] reiterated twice within one service that
[22:59] he has it all in control
[23:01] don't worry about it and i love the
[23:02] statement you made brother timothy don't
[23:05] be distracted by the winds and the ways

[56:04] turn to revelation chapter 1
[56:07] and
[56:09] we are going to
[56:11] we're going to read from revelation
[56:14] chapter 1 and i would like to read
[56:18] let me see the first verse there first
[56:20] let me see that
[56:21] all right go down to verse 9.
[56:26] i john
[56:27] who also am your brother and companion
[56:30] in tribulation
[56:32] and in the kingdom and patience of jesus
[56:34] christ
[56:35] was in the aisle that is called patmos
[56:38] for the word of god and for the
[56:40] testimony of jesus christ
[56:42] i was in the spirit
[56:44] on the lord's day
[56:46] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[56:48] a trumpet
[56:50] saying i am alpha and omega
[56:53] the first and the last and what they'll
[56:56] see us write in the book and send it to
[56:58] the seven churches which are in asia
[57:01] and to ephesus and to smyrna
[57:03] and pergamos and under thytara and
[57:06] sardis and then to philadelphia and to
[57:08] the last aids that we're living in
[57:11] laodicea
[57:12] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[57:15] with me
[57:16] being turned i saw seven golden candle
[57:20] sticks
[57:21] in the midst of the seven candlesticks
[57:23] one likened to the son of man clothed
[57:26] with the garment down to the foot and
[57:28] gird about with the paps with the golden
[57:30] girdle
[57:31] his head and his hairs were white like
[57:34] wool as white as the snow
[57:36] his eyes were as a flame of fire his
[57:39] feet is likened to fine brass as if they
[57:42] burned in a furnace
[57:44] his voice is the sound of many waters
[57:48] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[57:51] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[57:53] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[57:56] as the sun shineth in his strength
[57:59] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[58:02] dead
[58:03] and he laid his right hand upon me
[58:05] saying unto me
[58:07] these wonderful words fear not
[58:10] i am the first and the last
[58:12] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[58:16] behold i am alive forevermore
[58:19] amen and i have the keys of hell
[58:23] and of death
[58:24] amen may god bless you can be seated
[58:27] may bless his word this morning
[58:30] we're going to take a part two on our
[58:32] last service that we spoke on the people
[58:35] of the resurrection
[58:37] because i believe that we are people
[58:39] that are headed back to eden
[58:41] yet make no mistake about it although we
[58:44] have received one the greatest signpost
[58:46] by this message that we're nearing that
[58:48] land
[58:49] we have not arrived yet
[58:51] oh i know there are those who have
[58:54] thought we're already in the millennium
[58:56] or this is already we're already back to
[58:58] eden but we're not quite there
[59:01] amen but the signpost points us to the
[59:04] city but the signpost never is the city
[59:08] and
[59:09] we we see many many signs along the way
[59:12] that tells us where we are in this
[59:14] life's journey
[59:16] the signs of noah as it was in those
[59:19] days and the signs of sodom the signs
[59:22] that the church is now in the same
[59:25] condition that the jewish church was
[59:28] 2 000 years ago when they were blinded
[59:31] and their in their blindness they
[59:33] crucified the lord of glory their
[59:35] messiah
[59:37] but you know the bride herself is a sign
[59:41] the bride is the last sign you are the
[59:44] last sign before the coming groom
[59:47] amen
[59:48] a bride that is prepared to meet her
[59:51] bridegroom
[59:52] i think of this as brother branham said
[59:54] in the identification of christ and the
[59:56] oli of all in all ages is god manifested
[1:00:00] in flesh now in the flesh of his bride
[1:00:04] for the bride and the husband is the
[1:00:07] self-same flesh listen these powerful
[1:00:10] words these two are one
[1:00:13] and the church is becoming the bride all
[1:00:16] the time by believing the word so that
[1:00:18] the word and the church becomes the same
[1:00:22] the word in the church
[1:00:24] making it the bride the last sign god
[1:00:28] identifying himself the word in the
[1:00:31] church
[1:00:32] so the bride as he said is the last sign
[1:00:35] with because the word he said has been
[1:00:38] made flesh
[1:00:40] in a church in a bright people
[1:00:42] remember this was the last sign
[1:00:45] a man of all of the prophets down to the
[1:00:48] ages that came and and jesus would be
[1:00:51] the last sign to the jewish dispensation
[1:00:54] which would be the word made flesh
[1:00:58] and i think of it of all the prophets
[1:01:00] and all the scriptures and all the
[1:01:02] promises and all the the many people
[1:01:04] down to the ages
[1:01:06] where many movements and church
[1:01:08] movements and bride movements but you
[1:01:11] know here we come to where the fullness
[1:01:14] of the word is being made flesh in a
[1:01:16] bride people in this last day
[1:01:19] and the end time signs all of these
[1:01:22] signs are showing us that we're about to
[1:01:24] be snatched out of here
[1:01:27] for it is the eagle age where we'll be
[1:01:29] caught up the word is harpazo in the in
[1:01:32] the greek and it means to be literally
[1:01:35] snatched away
[1:01:37] the eagle is the miracle it comes out of
[1:01:40] the heavens i tell you if you don't
[1:01:42] believe in miracles the resurrection the
[1:01:44] body change and the rapture it will be
[1:01:47] nothing shorter than miraculous
[1:01:49] and this is why brother branham would
[1:01:50] say if you can't believe
[1:01:53] get if i can't get the church to even
[1:01:55] believe for divine healing how will they
[1:01:57] ever believe for rapture
[1:01:59] for the resurrection of the dead for the
[1:02:01] great translation of the saints
[1:02:04] now where is it that he's going to take
[1:02:06] us because he's going to take us out of
[1:02:09] this world the bible speaks of a
[1:02:10] deliverance
[1:02:12] he said that we should pray always to
[1:02:14] escape
[1:02:15] the things that are coming upon the
[1:02:17] earth he tells us that it'll be in the
[1:02:20] end time it will come like a trap and
[1:02:22] he'll snap and close very quickly upon
[1:02:25] the earth and he'll catch many unawares
[1:02:27] and he says for you not to be overcome
[1:02:30] with sufficiency and drunkenness and the
[1:02:32] cares of this life and he warns you
[1:02:35] don't don't don't be bogged down with
[1:02:37] everything keep your keep your eyes
[1:02:39] heavenly
[1:02:40] keep your thoughts on what you're really
[1:02:43] here for for you're here for a purpose
[1:02:46] for a reason and there is a fulfillment
[1:02:48] of the word of god that must be
[1:02:50] fulfilled in this hour
[1:02:53] now see you again you know he's going to
[1:02:55] take us somewhere he's going to take us
[1:02:58] into heaven
[1:03:00] we will have a marriage supper of the
[1:03:03] lamb in a glorified bodies
[1:03:06] bodies that are travel like a thought
[1:03:08] that can pass through the walls that can
[1:03:10] appear and disappear unconfined by the
[1:03:14] physical but at yet the same time be
[1:03:17] physical enough to eat fish and
[1:03:19] honeycomb and be felt and touch like he
[1:03:22] was
[1:03:23] we're talking about glorified bodies
[1:03:26] we're talking about something that is
[1:03:27] not a fiction it happened in the groom
[1:03:30] the same word that spoke of the groom
[1:03:32] speaks also of the bride it is a word
[1:03:35] that is promised for the end time people
[1:03:38] the people of the resurrection
[1:03:43] but we're not staying there very long
[1:03:46] amen just three and a half years
[1:03:49] i can just imagine during that time if
[1:03:51] you just examine the bible there's seven
[1:03:54] there's seven angels in the book of
[1:03:56] revelation these seven angels are seven
[1:04:00] church age messengers or seven stars
[1:04:03] in the hand of jehovah and these same
[1:04:06] seven there they they uh they hold the
[1:04:10] the very truths of the word of god and
[1:04:13] and these very these
[1:04:15] seven one of them will be
[1:04:18] in
[1:04:18] one of them that holds one of the vials
[1:04:20] will be actually worshiped by john he
[1:04:23] will get down to worship him and he said
[1:04:25] don't you worship me
[1:04:27] i may look so much like your lord but
[1:04:29] i'm not him i'm a prophet
[1:04:31] just like you are
[1:04:33] amen so he would he would he said i'm
[1:04:36] your fellow servants one of your
[1:04:37] brothers
[1:04:38] right amen and so he would show him many
[1:04:42] things he would show him um the bride
[1:04:44] the lamb's wife he would show them the
[1:04:46] new jerusalem that is coming the new
[1:04:49] heavens and the new earth he would show
[1:04:51] him the judgment of the great he
[1:04:53] would show him how there would be a
[1:04:55] voice in the last days of in revelation
[1:04:58] 18 that says come out of her my people
[1:05:00] he was so he would sow there all of
[1:05:03] these different scenes to john
[1:05:06] but he also holds one of the vials
[1:05:10] and as we as we know of these seven
[1:05:13] angels holding with the vials i can just
[1:05:15] imagine this is just my imagination now
[1:05:19] maybe it's gonna muck but it's my
[1:05:21] imagination as we sit there at the
[1:05:23] marriage supper
[1:05:25] during that three and a half years
[1:05:27] one of them rescues herself from the
[1:05:29] table
[1:05:30] and says i've got a i've got some
[1:05:32] judgments to pour out
[1:05:35] amen i got a vial to empty
[1:05:37] going to be upon the beast and upon the
[1:05:39] false prophet for the tribulation period
[1:05:43] let me tell you friends it's not going
[1:05:45] to be a fun time for the tribulation
[1:05:48] there are going to be judgments that
[1:05:49] have been reserved
[1:05:51] kept up in vessels or vials as as
[1:05:54] pictured symbolically in the book of
[1:05:56] revelation that will be poured out
[1:05:58] during the tribulation period
[1:06:00] amen they'll be poured out from heaven
[1:06:03] and as we as we do and we see them
[1:06:06] remember when we see the great judgments
[1:06:09] there's a great sound in heaven
[1:06:11] of a rejoicing of the saints
[1:06:14] as they say as they rejoice and say
[1:06:16] hallelujah
[1:06:18] for the lord god omnipotent reigns
[1:06:21] amen and he has shown his judgments upon
[1:06:24] the earth
[1:06:25] oh it's going to be a wonderful time
[1:06:28] you don't want to miss it
[1:06:30] you don't want to be here amen you want
[1:06:32] to be there
[1:06:34] amen
[1:06:35] you know and it'll be as the seventh
[1:06:37] seal that finished up the gentile ages
[1:06:41] breaking the silence and initiating the
[1:06:43] end time events
[1:06:45] and it'll all conclude with the coming
[1:06:47] back of christ with his bride at
[1:06:49] armageddon and taking the world over for
[1:06:52] a thousand years and after that thousand
[1:06:55] years is over bringing the world to
[1:06:58] judgment at the great white throne
[1:07:00] and death and hell and satan
[1:07:03] will be thrown into the lake of fire
[1:07:06] amen and eden will come again upon the
[1:07:09] earth as the new jerusalem comes down as
[1:07:13] a bride adorned from her of her husband
[1:07:16] let me tell you this is no fiction
[1:07:19] this is not just a story
[1:07:21] this is the very plan of redemption
[1:07:24] god has not given up on the earth
[1:07:27] god has not given up on you
[1:07:29] he has not given up on having a pride
[1:07:32] without spiraling
[1:07:34] he has not given up on one of his plans
[1:07:37] he has done everything that he is all of
[1:07:39] his power to bring the past that which
[1:07:42] he had in his mind before the world
[1:07:44] begins and nothing can stop it devils
[1:07:47] can't stop it his imps can't stop it
[1:07:50] and i want to remind the devil this
[1:07:52] morning he's only temporary
[1:07:56] he's not eternal
[1:07:58] you are eternal
[1:07:59] but he is not eternal so how am i
[1:08:02] eternal brother tim that i pre-exist
[1:08:04] just how you did in the very thoughts
[1:08:06] and mind of god before the world began
[1:08:09] his thoughts as eternal it becomes word
[1:08:12] it becomes spoken it takes on flesh and
[1:08:15] it goes into his presence
[1:08:23] what a blessed people we are
[1:08:27] originally
[1:08:28] mankind lived in eden
[1:08:31] but when
[1:08:32] man sinned he died
[1:08:36] that meant he was separated from god
[1:08:40] he was
[1:08:41] then separated from eden
[1:08:45] you see he could not live in heaven
[1:08:49] because that was heaven on earth it was
[1:08:51] paradise
[1:08:52] it was eden
[1:08:54] it was wonderful
[1:08:56] it was
[1:08:57] it was everything that heaven one day
[1:08:58] will be
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:02] maybe heaven would be a little more but
[1:09:03] it was heaven
[1:09:05] are you with me amen i know heaven will
[1:09:08] be a little more because there won't be
[1:09:10] no lucifer there
[1:09:12] there won't be no tempter anymore
[1:09:15] he has his place in the lake of fire
[1:09:17] aren't you glad to know the devil has a
[1:09:19] place
[1:09:20] death has its place
[1:09:22] it only serves for a moment in a time
[1:09:25] but one day it'll inhabit him
[1:09:29] it'll it'll take the last one of god's
[1:09:31] children into his presence it'll
[1:09:34] separate the last child from its mother
[1:09:37] and the last mother from his child it'll
[1:09:40] do its last damage one day
[1:09:43] one day it's coming to an end one day
[1:09:46] satan you're coming to an end
[1:09:49] one day sin you're coming to an end one
[1:09:53] day evil you're coming to an end
[1:09:56] but hallelujah there is no end to the
[1:10:00] child of god hallelujah for we came from
[1:10:03] god and we're going back to god we were
[1:10:06] eternal in his thoughts and we are
[1:10:08] eternal now we are not we are not at all
[1:10:12] temporary beings
[1:10:14] the baptism of the holy ghost revealed
[1:10:16] to you your eternity
[1:10:25] originally mankind lived in eden
[1:10:29] he got separated by sin
[1:10:31] driven out
[1:10:33] because sin
[1:10:35] and sinners
[1:10:36] cannot live
[1:10:38] in eden
[1:10:41] and eden was closed off to man
[1:10:46] with chairman's guarding
[1:10:49] the way back
[1:10:51] nobody can come back in
[1:10:54] but as i said god has never given up
[1:10:57] on human beings he's never given up on
[1:10:59] the earth
[1:11:01] he has never given up on his plan for
[1:11:03] humans to live here on earth and
[1:11:05] and earth will again some glorious day
[1:11:08] be in eden again
[1:11:10] the climax of history
[1:11:12] will be the creation of a new heavens
[1:11:15] and a new earth
[1:11:17] not in the sense of a creation like we
[1:11:19] think of a creation out of nothing but
[1:11:21] god will take and remake and remold and
[1:11:25] and the old will pass away and become a
[1:11:27] new creation
[1:11:29] by by the power of the word
[1:11:32] now should it be a
[1:11:35] resurrected universe
[1:11:37] inhabited by resurrected people
[1:11:40] living with the resurrected jesus
[1:11:44] hallelujah
[1:11:46] what awesome thought it is
[1:11:48] now to do this
[1:11:50] god has to have a resurrected people
[1:11:54] not just a resurrection of bleach bones
[1:11:57] and decayed bodies
[1:11:59] but a resurrected people who were
[1:12:02] quickened and made alive and and
[1:12:06] and brought forth back from death
[1:12:08] separation from god and brought back
[1:12:10] into unity with god where they in christ
[1:12:14] are one together
[1:12:16] amen not on this new earth will be
[1:12:18] people who will make up his bride who
[1:12:21] will be with him in the new jerusalem
[1:12:24] then there'll be millions of others who
[1:12:26] will be outside the city
[1:12:29] you know when we think about grace
[1:12:32] it's a lot larger than you can ever
[1:12:34] imagine
[1:12:38] a lot of times we think
[1:12:40] oh it's just grace upon the bride that's
[1:12:43] all he had in his mind no that's not all
[1:12:45] he had in his mind
[1:12:47] there are people in the lamb's book
[1:12:50] there are people in the book of life
[1:12:53] there is a bride and there is a church
[1:12:56] they're called in revelation 7 a
[1:12:59] multitude without number
[1:13:01] and they never received the holy ghost
[1:13:05] here they never drank of the the
[1:13:07] thousands of living waters here but
[1:13:09] revelation 7 said that he will wipe the
[1:13:12] tears from their eyes those who went
[1:13:14] through the great tribulation and he
[1:13:16] will he he will absolutely lead them to
[1:13:20] life
[1:13:21] to life-giving waters
[1:13:25] amen because why we can know him as the
[1:13:28] thirst quencher
[1:13:31] i think about every sinner that's all it
[1:13:33] is there are thirsty people
[1:13:36] god made you to thirst for god
[1:13:38] your man smokes because he's thirsty a
[1:13:40] man drinks because he's thirsty
[1:13:43] a man commits adultery or woman because
[1:13:46] they're thirsty amen they are thirsting
[1:13:48] for something that that sin cannot
[1:13:51] quench
[1:13:53] amen i stood with a preacher one day
[1:13:56] as i talked to him about his boy and
[1:13:59] you know he was a center boy and he said
[1:14:01] oh tim
[1:14:03] tim he said my boy is just thirsty
[1:14:06] and i looked at him i said thirsty he
[1:14:08] said yes he's so thirsty tim
[1:14:12] he's trying to quench it with everything
[1:14:14] else but he thirsts for a living god
[1:14:17] somehow we've got to get him to a living
[1:14:19] god
[1:14:20] amen because he is the only one that can
[1:14:22] satisfy the hunger in a human heart
[1:14:27] hey man
[1:14:29] but upon this earth
[1:14:31] can you think about what was revealed
[1:14:33] when the book was open you remember the
[1:14:35] lamb took the seals off the book
[1:14:37] that's why we're preaching we're the
[1:14:39] people of the book it's open it's not
[1:14:41] closed
[1:14:42] there's not six seals and one's left
[1:14:45] all the seals have been opened
[1:14:48] amen in fact it was the seventh one that
[1:14:50] opened up the rest of them
[1:14:52] it started the coming of the lord it
[1:14:54] broke the silence on the scripture it
[1:14:57] revealed the mysteries of the other
[1:14:59] seals
[1:15:01] somebody with me
[1:15:02] and it continues unfolding is it it's
[1:15:05] not a one-time event a singular event it
[1:15:08] just keeps unfolding and unfolding
[1:15:10] unfolding i turn in the end time events
[1:15:13] do you not know you're in the seventh
[1:15:15] seal do you not know you're in the
[1:15:17] coming of the lord do you not know that
[1:15:20] this is the hour where everything is
[1:15:22] coming to a climax even you are moving
[1:15:25] towards a climax
[1:15:30] it's an awesome power
[1:15:33] one thing he said it was like a roman
[1:15:35] candle one thing will open up for this
[1:15:37] and out of that we'll shoot five more
[1:15:39] out of that one it will come and
[1:15:41] there'll be another explosion and
[1:15:43] there'll be a and one event opens up
[1:15:45] another event and one event opens up
[1:15:48] another event and that event opens up
[1:15:50] another event until the whole coming is
[1:15:54] consummated with his return back to
[1:15:57] earth with the saints
[1:16:01] you see we're not in a time of just one
[1:16:03] coming
[1:16:05] in fact the first coming we usually talk
[1:16:07] about the rapture is more of a going
[1:16:08] away than it is a coming
[1:16:12] but there's another coming
[1:16:14] he's going to come back with his saints
[1:16:17] it'll be at the great battle of
[1:16:19] armageddon
[1:16:20] i want you to look up this morning
[1:16:24] get your eyes
[1:16:25] on your redeemer
[1:16:27] it's the hour where the redemption is
[1:16:30] being made known
[1:16:32] now as i said
[1:16:34] when the book was opened
[1:16:37] it revealed things you couldn't imagine
[1:16:40] who would ever thought under the fifth
[1:16:42] seal
[1:16:43] there would be jews
[1:16:45] who had been killed by all down to the
[1:16:48] ages but namely through hitler and
[1:16:50] eichmann and and stalin and all the
[1:16:52] mothers that killed those six million
[1:16:55] jews
[1:16:56] and there they were as martyrs
[1:17:01] under the uh under the under the altar
[1:17:04] as it were
[1:17:05] and they were crying out how long o lord
[1:17:08] how long and brother branham would look
[1:17:10] in there and by revelation he said these
[1:17:12] are not believers
[1:17:14] he said they are they're there for the
[1:17:16] testimony which they held
[1:17:18] they held onto the faith of abraham
[1:17:21] is that they are given white robes
[1:17:25] notice they wait till they get there to
[1:17:28] be given white rope
[1:17:30] who would ever thought there could be
[1:17:32] people there given white robes
[1:17:36] who had
[1:17:37] been blinded
[1:17:39] because they had not known their messiah
[1:17:42] and because of blindness they were in
[1:17:44] this condition and god in his grace and
[1:17:46] mercy saved them anyhow
[1:17:51] you sometimes think you know grace
[1:17:55] amen you think grace is just all about
[1:17:58] you god so loved the world
[1:18:02] she gave his only begotten name
[1:18:09] you think of that
[1:18:11] then seven a multitude we're talking
[1:18:14] about revelation seven
[1:18:16] a multitude without number
[1:18:18] you think you're the only one gonna have
[1:18:20] eternal life no you're not
[1:18:25] you think you're the only one that's
[1:18:27] going to be in the new heavens the earth
[1:18:29] no you're not
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:32] there's going to be millions there
[1:18:35] brother bradley said there'll be people
[1:18:36] making that you never thought would make
[1:18:38] it there'll be people there that you
[1:18:41] didn't even know your testimony of your
[1:18:43] life turn them around
[1:18:47] in the best moment
[1:18:48] or perhaps their worst moment
[1:18:58] you know rather than coming around and
[1:19:00] saying it's us for and no more
[1:19:02] we ought to be a little more
[1:19:04] all-embracing
[1:19:06] and saying oh god save them i don't care
[1:19:09] i don't care if they just make it in
[1:19:11] they're not bribed but they're a
[1:19:13] multitude without number i don't care
[1:19:15] how you have to do it
[1:19:17] but somehow save on whether it's my kids
[1:19:19] whether it's
[1:19:20] my friend's mother is that stranger
[1:19:23] whether it's that sinner that's so far
[1:19:25] away from god never let me get so hard
[1:19:28] that i don't want nobody else in heaven
[1:19:31] but me
[1:19:36] oh yes there will be a bride
[1:19:39] she's entitled to the new jerusalem
[1:19:42] there will be those outside the city
[1:19:44] who will come and bring their their
[1:19:47] gifts into the city they don't live in
[1:19:49] the city
[1:19:50] but they live
[1:19:54] but they live
[1:19:56] don't give up on your loved ones yet
[1:20:00] are you with me
[1:20:01] amen don't give up on so well my my
[1:20:04] grandma my grandma brother she didn't
[1:20:06] believe the message and she did the best
[1:20:08] she knew don't give up on it just give
[1:20:10] put her in the hands of jesus
[1:20:13] amen just surrender them to god
[1:20:16] whatever you say about them one way or
[1:20:17] the other wouldn't change their destiny
[1:20:20] amen so why not just believe you can put
[1:20:22] them in the hands of a loving god
[1:20:24] who cares and understands the faults of
[1:20:27] humanity who forgives
[1:20:30] who accepts
[1:20:32] who's got more mercy than what you could
[1:20:34] ever imagine
[1:20:40] that's the kind of god i can love
[1:20:46] a god whose love is so great
[1:20:50] oh yes
[1:20:52] there definitely is a bride and she's a
[1:20:54] special set of heart people
[1:20:57] and if you're part of her by the baptism
[1:21:00] of the holy ghost which is the only way
[1:21:01] you can be bride
[1:21:05] you are a blessed person
[1:21:13] upon this earth will be people who make
[1:21:15] us bride
[1:21:16] who will be with him in the new
[1:21:18] jerusalem there'll be millions of others
[1:21:20] outside the city
[1:21:22] earth will be so enlarged that there'll
[1:21:24] be no more
[1:21:26] sea well he'll accommodate them all
[1:21:31] i just want to say you don't want to
[1:21:32] miss it
[1:21:34] amen
[1:21:35] heaven is a real place it's a place for
[1:21:38] the people of the resurrection you don't
[1:21:40] want to miss it
[1:21:42] if you you know brother branham said i i
[1:21:44] can't even describe it
[1:21:47] what it's really like he sublime
[1:21:49] wouldn't touch it i can't find a word in
[1:21:53] human language and he was he didn't have
[1:21:56] a large vocabulary but he said i can't
[1:21:58] find a word that can really describe
[1:22:02] what it's like
[1:22:04] but he said after being there i can't
[1:22:06] even be the same william branham anymore
[1:22:12] heaven is a real place
[1:22:14] now brother branham talked about this
[1:22:16] and things that are to be he said
[1:22:18] i do not think that heaven is a place my
[1:22:20] mother used to tell me about
[1:22:23] i believe the church has grown from that
[1:22:26] to think it used to be a hundred years
[1:22:28] ago or two i think old-timers used to
[1:22:31] think that everybody that died went up
[1:22:33] to heaven and had a heart and sat there
[1:22:35] on the clouds and played a harp
[1:22:38] now they knew there was a place called
[1:22:40] heaven
[1:22:41] but if that be so
[1:22:43] all the musicians have it on us
[1:22:46] in other words you better start taking
[1:22:48] some lessons now
[1:22:52] but it isn't that kind of a place
[1:22:55] it isn't playing harps at all
[1:22:58] although
[1:22:58] there are harps there
[1:23:01] and there is music there
[1:23:04] amen but he said i don't believe the
[1:23:06] bible teaches that but that was a con
[1:23:08] conception they had before the fullness
[1:23:11] of the word came into existence or the
[1:23:14] opening of the seven seals
[1:23:16] that's promised to us in this age then
[1:23:19] that we didn't understand and i believe
[1:23:21] heaven is a real place
[1:23:24] just the same as this is a real place
[1:23:27] reach over there and fill your pube by
[1:23:28] you in the wood there on the back it's
[1:23:31] real isn't it
[1:23:32] heaven is more real than that
[1:23:35] amen he said
[1:23:36] he said and we don't just sit up there
[1:23:38] for eternity and set up on the cloud we
[1:23:40] don't just strum our heart from all of
[1:23:43] uh here ever but we're going to a real
[1:23:46] place
[1:23:47] listen this where are we going to do
[1:23:50] things
[1:23:53] we're going to live
[1:23:56] we're going to work
[1:23:59] we're going to life
[1:24:01] to a real eternal life
[1:24:03] we're going to heaven a paradise
[1:24:07] and just like adam and eve worked and
[1:24:09] lived and ate and enjoyed in the garden
[1:24:13] of eden before sin came in we're right
[1:24:15] we're on our road right back there again
[1:24:18] right back the first item through sin
[1:24:21] taking us out the second item through
[1:24:23] righteousness brings us back in again
[1:24:26] justifies us and brings us back in
[1:24:30] hallelujah you think of it it's a real
[1:24:32] place
[1:24:34] a place where we live
[1:24:36] we enjoy we work
[1:24:39] just like adam and eve worked and lived
[1:24:41] and ate and enjoyed in the garden of
[1:24:43] eden that's what heaven is
[1:24:46] the present earth that we now live in is
[1:24:49] is a place actually it's an intermediate
[1:24:53] place if i could call it this world
[1:24:55] we're now living in
[1:24:57] it's a intermediate place between heaven
[1:25:00] and hell
[1:25:02] for the believer
[1:25:04] this wretched life is the closest you
[1:25:07] will ever come to hell
[1:25:11] and for the sinner
[1:25:13] this is the closest you'll ever get to
[1:25:16] heaven
[1:25:20] think about the best of this lifesaver
[1:25:26] is the only taste of heaven you'll ever
[1:25:29] have
[1:25:33] the present earth
[1:25:35] before it's renewed and the new
[1:25:37] jerusalem comes down upon it it's an
[1:25:40] in-between world
[1:25:42] it's touched by both heaven and hell
[1:25:48] we're
[1:25:49] actually in this dimension in this realm
[1:25:52] demons come
[1:25:54] in this realm
[1:25:56] and let me just talk demons don't just
[1:25:58] come they come and inhabit people
[1:26:04] amen and then to into this room angels
[1:26:07] come
[1:26:10] that's right
[1:26:11] angels have been seen in this realm
[1:26:14] amen not just now but through the bible
[1:26:17] amen but and now
[1:26:19] angels have been seen here they can they
[1:26:22] can live they can walk they can they can
[1:26:26] experience things in this dimension
[1:26:31] spirits
[1:26:32] amen there is one particular spirit that
[1:26:35] comes to live in us
[1:26:37] is called the holy spirit
[1:26:39] amen so again this present world is an
[1:26:43] in-between world that is touched by
[1:26:46] both heaven and hell
[1:26:48] earth leads directly to heaven
[1:26:51] or directly to hell
[1:26:59] this life affords us a choice between
[1:27:01] the two
[1:27:04] you say well brother tim but we were
[1:27:05] chosen before the foundation world
[1:27:07] that's true but you got to make a choice
[1:27:13] you must choose what he chose
[1:27:16] and the truth of it is being a
[1:27:18] predestinated seed you can only manifest
[1:27:21] what you are
[1:27:23] but nevertheless the best of heaven or
[1:27:25] the best of earth is a glimpse of heaven
[1:27:27] the worst of of this life
[1:27:30] is a glimpse of hell
[1:27:33] for the christian as i said the closest
[1:27:36] this is the closest you'll ever come to
[1:27:38] hell
[1:27:41] for unbelievers it's the closest you'll
[1:27:43] ever come to heaven
[1:27:46] and you cannot go on pretending this
[1:27:49] world that we know now is the only world
[1:27:52] we will live in
[1:27:54] one breath away
[1:27:56] is another world
[1:28:00] never forget you're that close
[1:28:03] say it's a ways away i can't say yes
[1:28:05] it's beyond your seat taste smell fill
[1:28:07] in here
[1:28:08] but i want you to understand it's not
[1:28:11] that far away one breath
[1:28:19] this mortal life
[1:28:22] is a temporary life
[1:28:25] so don't just
[1:28:27] go right on the life you know putting on
[1:28:29] the dog pretending this is all that it
[1:28:32] is and like you're somebody here
[1:28:35] you're nothing but dust
[1:28:43] brother branham would say it this way
[1:28:45] there are people putting on too much dog
[1:28:47] we call in the street expression
[1:28:49] what are you anyhow but six foot of dirt
[1:28:52] god have mercy on you i i don't care how
[1:28:55] you can dress and how you can act and
[1:28:57] what kind of home you live in and what
[1:28:59] kind of car you drive if you're not born
[1:29:02] of the power and spirit of the
[1:29:04] resurrected jesus christ you're lost and
[1:29:07] will go to hell just as sure as a martin
[1:29:09] will go to his box
[1:29:12] oh he's not popular today to preach
[1:29:14] about health
[1:29:16] but let me tell you yes this loving god
[1:29:19] has created a place called hell
[1:29:23] it has a beginning and it has an end
[1:29:27] now there's a fire that won't quench
[1:29:29] because he's a consuming fire and there
[1:29:32] is a destroyer a worm that won't die
[1:29:35] because he is the destroyer because the
[1:29:37] soul that sinneth it shall die
[1:29:41] there's no such thing as immortal life
[1:29:43] and hell
[1:29:44] you'll come to an end
[1:29:46] maybe a million years later but you'll
[1:29:49] come to an end
[1:29:52] it's your choice
[1:29:54] do you choose life or choose death
[1:29:57] brother branham said at the door to your
[1:29:59] heart
[1:30:00] and express about the painting where a
[1:30:02] man painted a picture in the critic the
[1:30:04] art critic looked at it and said oh
[1:30:06] you've got this picture and you're
[1:30:08] missing a handle on the door you got
[1:30:10] jesus knocking on the door and there's
[1:30:11] no handle
[1:30:13] and he was critiquing the picture and
[1:30:15] said you you left off something
[1:30:17] important here he said no
[1:30:18] sir in this door
[1:30:21] the handle is only on the inside
[1:30:25] he cannot open from the outside
[1:30:28] he cannot save you against your will
[1:30:32] he cannot heal you against your will he
[1:30:35] cannot send a revival against your will
[1:30:38] you've got to be willing to open the
[1:30:40] door and invite him in think about it
[1:30:43] how much it lays on you
[1:30:46] amen you've got to open the door to him
[1:30:49] he won't do it against your will
[1:30:51] he won't heal you you say i need healing
[1:30:54] well i'll tell you if you sit right
[1:30:55] there and your unbelief and say well
[1:30:57] it's for others not for me he can never
[1:30:59] heal you till you open that door
[1:31:02] amen and you say well the revival i'll
[1:31:05] tell you what i ain't going to act like
[1:31:06] that i'll tell you right now i'm not
[1:31:08] going to get inspired i ain't going to
[1:31:11] get drunk on the stimulation of
[1:31:13] revelation like that people talk about
[1:31:15] they got revelation and they don't have
[1:31:18] no stimulation your wine don't is a good
[1:31:21] you don't have no fears
[1:31:23] no life in it
[1:31:25] this doesn't went bad
[1:31:28] true revelation produces stimulation
[1:31:31] it causes the hallelujahs to thank you
[1:31:34] jesus the glory to god
[1:31:36] amen it causes tears to come down your
[1:31:38] face it causes hands to go up in worship
[1:31:42] come on and it translates from that into
[1:31:44] a life that you live
[1:31:46] don't talk to me about revelation
[1:31:50] and you can't show me no stimulation
[1:31:56] that's education not revelation
[1:32:01] education is dark and clear
[1:32:04] words and formulas and ideas and
[1:32:08] hypotheses
[1:32:10] revelation is quickening power
[1:32:16] you want revival you have to open
[1:32:19] amen you want healing you have to open
[1:32:21] you want salvation you have to open the
[1:32:23] door
[1:32:26] the life i'm talking about here is an
[1:32:28] eternal life
[1:32:30] it's not it's not an eternal church
[1:32:32] service
[1:32:34] don't get in your idea that we're going
[1:32:36] to go up there and heaven's going to be
[1:32:37] this boring place where we're all just
[1:32:39] shouting and glorifying god for millions
[1:32:42] and millions of years
[1:32:44] so i don't want to go to a place like
[1:32:45] that that sounds more like hell to me
[1:32:47] brother tim well
[1:32:49] it's not held to the cherubims but
[1:32:51] that's their job not yours
[1:32:54] cherubims were made to do that
[1:32:58] to say hallelujahs and glory to god
[1:33:00] that's their job that's not your job
[1:33:03] your job of course does include saying
[1:33:05] hallelujahs and glories to god thank you
[1:33:08] jesus and there's going to be plenty of
[1:33:09] that
[1:33:10] but i'm telling you again heaven's going
[1:33:12] to be more than a church service
[1:33:15] where we sing and sing and sing and
[1:33:17] absent mindly shout praises to god
[1:33:20] forever that's not heaven
[1:33:22] heaven is a place of wonderment
[1:33:26] it's a place of joy a peace
[1:33:29] of love
[1:33:30] can i tell you it has hills
[1:33:33] and valleys and mountains and rivers
[1:33:36] and the most crystal springs
[1:33:39] and crystal rivers
[1:33:41] and open fields and wooded veils
[1:33:46] peace
[1:33:48] when brother branham was in the pristine
[1:33:50] mountains of canada he told eddie
[1:33:52] biskell
[1:33:53] that heaven
[1:33:55] that he went to
[1:33:56] looked a whole lot like that
[1:33:59] with rolling hills and
[1:34:01] lofty mountains with beautiful fields
[1:34:03] like bluegrass
[1:34:06] indescribable colors
[1:34:08] more vivid than
[1:34:10] anything you've ever seen he said they
[1:34:12] had eyes
[1:34:13] but their eyesight was somehow greater
[1:34:15] than anything that we've ever had
[1:34:19] it's a land full of animals
[1:34:24] amen and wildlife where nothing will
[1:34:26] hurt or destroy all of my holy mountains
[1:34:29] for there the lion will lay down by the
[1:34:31] lamb and the wolf will be tame and the
[1:34:33] bit the bear will be will be cuddly and
[1:34:37] gentle
[1:34:38] a place where things you love
[1:34:42] here in this life
[1:34:44] you'll have some of those very things
[1:34:47] there
[1:34:49] houses
[1:34:51] lands
[1:34:52] is a city
[1:34:53] it's a country
[1:34:55] it's real because it has foundations
[1:34:58] it has streets and trees
[1:35:01] and real houses with real furniture
[1:35:04] to resemble things we enjoyed here
[1:35:09] and i'm not just talking about the
[1:35:10] millennium
[1:35:12] but in the present heaven
[1:35:16] which is the temporary holding place
[1:35:19] for the saints and where we will go to
[1:35:21] for the three and a half years
[1:35:23] temporarily
[1:35:26] it's a home
[1:35:27] brother branham when he went there
[1:35:29] hope told him
[1:35:31] but you have a home here he said no
[1:35:33] we're branhams we're vagabonds we don't
[1:35:34] own nothing he lived in a little
[1:35:37] one-room shanty that he that he rented
[1:35:40] and and had no indoor toilet or running
[1:35:43] water it was
[1:35:44] it was just a
[1:35:45] very shocked little shotgun house living
[1:35:49] in poverty him and his wife and they had
[1:35:51] a a chair that he had bought to come
[1:35:54] home from work and rest in and read his
[1:35:56] bible and study for the services and
[1:35:59] that was taken away and he looked over
[1:36:01] there and there the morris chair was
[1:36:07] things he enjoyed here
[1:36:09] there
[1:36:13] we're going to live on a resurrected
[1:36:15] earth
[1:36:17] in a
[1:36:18] resurrected
[1:36:20] universe
[1:36:22] inhabited by resurrected people
[1:36:26] living with the resurrected jesus
[1:36:29] hallelujah
[1:36:31] amen
[1:36:32] so why wouldn't we choose life
[1:36:36] why wouldn't we choose life
[1:36:39] wherever you dreamed or ever hope for
[1:36:43] greater than you can imagine and we can
[1:36:46] imagine great things
[1:36:48] he's got it in store for you
[1:36:52] why not choose life
[1:36:54] and not death
[1:36:57] and the death i'm talking about is being
[1:36:59] separated from god
[1:37:01] and spending her forever
[1:37:04] away from his presence in hell
[1:37:10] the torment
[1:37:12] of your missed opportunities
[1:37:15] will be worse
[1:37:16] than the torments of any flame you can
[1:37:18] imagine
[1:37:21] and just as heaven is a real place
[1:37:24] hell is not a fiction
[1:37:27] it's a real place
[1:37:29] i hope you never find out how real it is
[1:37:34] i hope that you find out the reality of
[1:37:37] heaven
[1:37:38] but i'm telling you it depends on the
[1:37:41] choice you make
[1:37:43] that decision of receiving a pardon from
[1:37:47] your sins
[1:37:49] that moment in his presence where you
[1:37:51] receive his life because you can't live
[1:37:54] this life there
[1:37:58] brother branham also didn't just go to
[1:38:01] heaven he also went to hell
[1:38:04] he said i believe i was in that place
[1:38:07] it's a bottomless pit
[1:38:10] even you as a sinner today
[1:38:13] if you're a sinner you're just
[1:38:15] you're still
[1:38:17] without foundations you know you you
[1:38:19] have no place to stand and you think oh
[1:38:22] i have some morals and you only find out
[1:38:24] that that'll just slip away from you and
[1:38:26] cave out from under your feet and i'm
[1:38:28] not i don't i'll never be a bad person
[1:38:31] and that slips out on your feet and
[1:38:34] you're just finally going head over
[1:38:37] heels over your head over heels over and
[1:38:39] over into an abyss
[1:38:43] and i'm not even talking about after
[1:38:45] death i'm talking about right now
[1:38:49] as a sinner that's the way you are you
[1:38:51] have no foundation
[1:38:53] there is nothing to really stabilize you
[1:38:56] you say well i'll be this and i'll be
[1:38:58] that and i have resolved
[1:39:02] and it crumbles beneath you
[1:39:06] brother branham saw billy paul like this
[1:39:08] as a sinner boy
[1:39:10] i know yeah he was drinking or smoking
[1:39:12] and doing some things at least smoking
[1:39:14] and slipping around and lying to his
[1:39:17] daddy and all of that and brother
[1:39:19] branham saw him in his condition
[1:39:21] as he was laying there having taken a
[1:39:24] shot of penicillin and was now
[1:39:27] there on the on the verge of death and
[1:39:30] he saw his boy in the condition
[1:39:33] a prophet's son
[1:39:35] you may be a deacon's daughter you may
[1:39:37] be a deacon's son you may be the
[1:39:39] preacher's daughter the granddaughter
[1:39:41] you may be this or that let me tell you
[1:39:44] without christ
[1:39:47] you're trembling
[1:39:49] down down down
[1:39:52] and sin will always take you further
[1:39:54] than what you ever wanted to go
[1:40:00] now i don't want to hear about this
[1:40:02] brother tim i just want to hear about
[1:40:03] heaven
[1:40:04] well let me tell you something
[1:40:08] just as heaven is real
[1:40:11] hell is real us
[1:40:16] there is a heaven to gain in the hell to
[1:40:18] shun
[1:40:20] you we are not here in this light
[1:40:22] playing games
[1:40:25] it's the intermediate place and only
[1:40:27] here you can make a decision there it'll
[1:40:30] be too late
[1:40:32] one breath away
[1:40:34] your decisions sealed forever
[1:40:40] too late
[1:40:42] to make a change
[1:40:47] and that was brother branham himself he
[1:40:49] could see it
[1:40:50] he said i was sinking into an endless
[1:40:53] eternity
[1:40:55] many of you heard me tell of this
[1:40:57] but i'm sinking into it and the endless
[1:40:59] eternity you find these souls in prison
[1:41:01] and i'm going to paraphrase it perhaps i
[1:41:04] won't just read the quotes but he said i
[1:41:06] was first going down through the clouds
[1:41:08] notice he's going down do you realize do
[1:41:11] you realize that it is a fallen world
[1:41:14] it's a fallen life
[1:41:18] do you realize you were born in this
[1:41:21] life with your compass set on hell
[1:41:25] and the only hope for you is to turn
[1:41:28] around
[1:41:33] not only were you there i was born in a
[1:41:35] good family i had a good mother and dad
[1:41:38] i went to church i was a good little boy
[1:41:40] but good people go to hell and i was
[1:41:43] headed there
[1:41:44] i needed a savior
[1:41:50] i was going down through the clouds into
[1:41:52] the darkness i was sinking down down
[1:41:55] down
[1:42:03] going back to billy paul
[1:42:06] billy paul
[1:42:07] in that condition brother branham saw
[1:42:09] him he said oh god don't let my boy die
[1:42:11] that way.
[1:42:17] he come out of the vision
[1:42:19] went back to prayer so i can't
[1:42:21] let's see my boy go like that lord i
[1:42:23] can't let him let him go like that
[1:42:26] and the vision comes again he sees him
[1:42:28] tumbling over and over and he's laughing
[1:42:33] he's going on his merry way you know all
[1:42:35] the time laughing and going on and and
[1:42:38] and and
[1:42:39] just partying falling over tumbling over
[1:42:42] and over and he says god have mercy
[1:42:44] don't let my boy die like that and he
[1:42:47] said about that time i saw a big hand
[1:42:49] reach out
[1:42:52] and catch his
[1:42:54] fall oh i'm so glad to know today friend
[1:42:58] that's what happened to me that's what
[1:43:00] happened to every saved person we were
[1:43:03] in that very condition falling and
[1:43:05] falling and violently falling
[1:43:07] but in that moment he reached out
[1:43:11] and he caught me
[1:43:15] i'm so glad he broke my fall
[1:43:18] put my feet on solid ground
[1:43:25] no i can't look at down my nose at
[1:43:28] anybody and say well i never did this or
[1:43:30] never that that
[1:43:31] i did enough
[1:43:33] just in my own unbelief rejecting of
[1:43:36] turning down of not accepting him when i
[1:43:38] should
[1:43:44] brother branham said i was in this
[1:43:45] condition
[1:43:46] and he tells about it
[1:43:48] going down to the clouds going down down
[1:43:50] down and i got into the reasons of the
[1:43:53] loss and there i screamed
[1:43:58] sometimes people get upset because we
[1:44:00] scream in church and we shout in church
[1:44:05] a lot of these tumbling down on their
[1:44:07] way laughing and giggling and shouting
[1:44:10] and screaming and all the other things
[1:44:12] that they're doing going that merry way
[1:44:14] they don't realize they're falling
[1:44:16] falling falling
[1:44:18] but that's what they'll do also and he
[1:44:20] says and then i screamed
[1:44:23] terror set upon me
[1:44:26] he said i was in the reasons of the lost
[1:44:28] and there was no foundation to it oh
[1:44:30] brother tim that that that's not a kid
[1:44:33] 15 years old
[1:44:36] just a young boy
[1:44:38] a man never done a lot of things yet
[1:44:42] hadn't smoked hadn't drank the only
[1:44:43] thing he said i never committed adultery
[1:44:48] couldn't say i hadn't lied i hadn't done
[1:44:50] this or hadn't done that he said i'd
[1:44:51] done plenty of things
[1:44:53] but he said i said to god i've never
[1:44:55] committed adultery god
[1:44:58] and he said
[1:44:59] it had no foundations i could never stop
[1:45:02] falling and for eternity it looked like
[1:45:05] i was gonna fall
[1:45:07] there was no stopping nowhere
[1:45:11] i think of that
[1:45:14] sometimes you know you begin with the
[1:45:16] ear that is open to all the nonsense
[1:45:19] that wants to tear down the foundations
[1:45:21] of this message and try to discredit his
[1:45:24] truth
[1:45:25] i've never seen a one of them yet
[1:45:28] that ever come of that that didn't start
[1:45:30] falling
[1:45:33] they step off of the word of truth and
[1:45:36] they they begin to fall and tumble
[1:45:39] i've seen them go down as low until they
[1:45:41] don't you know very first they they they
[1:45:43] don't believe in god's prophet and then
[1:45:46] they don't believe in his message then
[1:45:48] they don't believe in the christ that's
[1:45:49] in him and then they don't believe in
[1:45:51] the god who sent christ and then
[1:45:54] they don't believe in the bible the word
[1:45:56] of god and then they just keep falling
[1:45:59] until they don't even believe in god at
[1:46:02] all
[1:46:10] i screamed for my daddy my daddy wasn't
[1:46:12] there
[1:46:13] oh it's going to be a lonely place
[1:46:17] i screamed for my mother somebody catch
[1:46:19] me there was no mother there
[1:46:21] i was just going i screamed to god and
[1:46:24] there was no god there
[1:46:28] there was nothing there and after a
[1:46:29] while i heard the most mournful sound i
[1:46:32] ever heard and the most awful feeling
[1:46:34] and even a little listen to this prophet
[1:46:37] after being a literal burning fire would
[1:46:40] it be pleasurable to decide of what that
[1:46:43] was
[1:46:45] it was the most horrible feelings i ever
[1:46:47] had
[1:46:48] i heard a noise something like a haunted
[1:46:50] affair
[1:46:52] it was women
[1:46:53] they had the green stuff
[1:46:55] just to see their face
[1:46:58] that green stuff under their eyes so he
[1:47:00] sees these heads
[1:47:03] coming down
[1:47:04] painted faces
[1:47:07] like women today paint their eyes and
[1:47:09] you want to look like hell
[1:47:10] you'll get a chance to
[1:47:13] they were going oh
[1:47:16] and i just screamed out oh god have
[1:47:18] mercy on me have mercy upon me if you'll
[1:47:20] just let me go back i promise to be a
[1:47:22] good boy
[1:47:24] and and and and and he said
[1:47:27] he he said it looked like
[1:47:30] as i screamed out of god just let me go
[1:47:32] back
[1:47:33] he said
[1:47:34] those weary creatures were all around
[1:47:36] and i just become a new arrival
[1:47:40] well i'll tell you what you know when he
[1:47:41] went beyond the curtain of time he said
[1:47:43] i was new arrival there
[1:47:46] and they were all coming down to greet
[1:47:48] me now which one which one do you want
[1:47:50] greeting you
[1:47:54] one breath from here where do you want
[1:47:57] what is your decision what which
[1:47:59] direction you want to go
[1:48:01] what kind of people do you want to meet
[1:48:09] you're painting your face like hell
[1:48:12] artificial on the outside because
[1:48:14] there's artificial on the inside
[1:48:17] let me tell you you'll have
[1:48:18] companionship down there with other
[1:48:21] people just like you
[1:48:23] but they ain't going to commiserate with
[1:48:24] you and you tell your little sub stories
[1:48:27] to each other everyone will be so
[1:48:30] consumed and lost in your own misery
[1:48:34] there won't be no company
[1:48:36] in hell
[1:48:41] most hideous horrible
[1:48:43] ungodly feeling look like great big eyes
[1:48:46] eye big eyelashes look like like a cat
[1:48:49] right back this green stuff conquered
[1:48:52] and they were going uh
[1:48:58] what a feeling
[1:49:05] you know if we understood hell the
[1:49:06] slightest bit there would be nobody
[1:49:08] saying go to hell
[1:49:12] it's far too easy to go to hell
[1:49:17] it requires no change of course
[1:49:20] you were we were born with our autopilot
[1:49:23] set right towards hell
[1:49:25] it's nothing to take lightly hell is the
[1:49:28] greatest tragedy
[1:49:30] the greatest single tragedy in the
[1:49:32] universe
[1:49:37] god loves us enough to tell us in the
[1:49:39] bible the truth
[1:49:41] that there are true destinations not one
[1:49:44] and we must choose the right path if
[1:49:46] we're going to heaven and let me tell
[1:49:48] you all roads don't lead to heaven
[1:49:51] buddha won't take you to heaven
[1:49:54] harry krishna will take you to heaven
[1:49:57] islam can't take you to heaven
[1:50:00] amen there's only one that leads to
[1:50:02] heaven that's jesus christ for he said
[1:50:04] no one can come to the father except by
[1:50:07] me
[1:50:08] all other roads lead to hell
[1:50:11] your education leads to hell
[1:50:15] your communism leads to hell
[1:50:17] your secularism leads to hell all the
[1:50:20] book knowledge you can get of this world
[1:50:22] leads to hell
[1:50:24] amen there's only one book that leads to
[1:50:27] heaven and that's this bible
[1:50:29] and there's only one person that leads
[1:50:31] to heaven and that's jesus christ
[1:50:34] amen you must accept him and accept his
[1:50:37] pardon
[1:50:42] you can tune me out but you won't tune
[1:50:44] it out one day
[1:50:52] god and satan are not equal opposites
[1:50:56] neither is heaven and hell equal
[1:50:57] opposites
[1:51:00] god has no equal as a person
[1:51:02] heaven has no equal as a place
[1:51:06] hell is not going to be a wonderful
[1:51:08] place
[1:51:09] it's going to be agonizingly dull and
[1:51:11] closed in insignificant without company
[1:51:14] without help without god without purpose
[1:51:17] without accomplishment
[1:51:20] it won't have his own story you won't be
[1:51:22] laughing and drinking beer and sipping
[1:51:24] wine and listening to rock music
[1:51:28] there won't be no bands playing rap and
[1:51:31] rock
[1:51:32] and country and elvis won't serenade you
[1:51:35] he'll be too wrapped up in his own awful
[1:51:37] decision
[1:51:39] of selling his opportunity for
[1:51:41] popularity
[1:51:46] there won't be no one to commiserate
[1:51:48] with you
[1:51:49] to comfort you
[1:51:51] everybody will be alone in their own
[1:51:53] grief
[1:51:55] knowing they rejected life
[1:51:59] but there's good news this morning none
[1:52:02] of us have to go to hell
[1:52:08] hallelujah none of us
[1:52:10] have to go there
[1:52:13] and i want you to consider the wonder of
[1:52:15] it all god determined that he would
[1:52:19] rather go to hell on our behalf than to
[1:52:23] live in heaven without us
[1:52:26] hallelujah
[1:52:28] glory to god amen he wanted you so much
[1:52:32] not to go to hell that he paid a
[1:52:34] horrible price on the cross and with the
[1:52:37] hell in your place where you don't have
[1:52:40] to go
[1:52:41] [Applause]
[1:52:43] he left all of heaven
[1:52:45] it's thrown his beauty his tranquility
[1:52:48] his wonderment it's vivid colors his
[1:52:50] wonderful mountain it's eaten he left it
[1:52:53] all to come down the earth
[1:52:56] not only to redeem man
[1:52:59] but to redeem the earth
[1:53:03] and being that your body
[1:53:06] is the first of the earth
[1:53:08] he took on
[1:53:10] cursed earth
[1:53:11] you can get this and prove in his word
[1:53:14] and the other sermon
[1:53:16] on the future home
[1:53:17] he come and wrapped himself
[1:53:20] in cursed earth oh yes it started from a
[1:53:23] spoken word
[1:53:24] it started from a seed but then he took
[1:53:27] that life and began to wrap around it
[1:53:30] little sails taken from his mother
[1:53:33] of food and things like that when we
[1:53:35] talk about mother his incubator mary
[1:53:39] right
[1:53:40] amen and there
[1:53:42] built around there a body of dust
[1:53:45] hallelujah
[1:53:47] think about this god would take on
[1:53:50] cursed earth
[1:53:52] and he would live in a life
[1:53:57] that could die
[1:53:58] they could get sick
[1:54:00] they could grown with a headache
[1:54:02] they could bear your infirmities
[1:54:04] they could die on a cross
[1:54:08] that can be tempted by sin
[1:54:12] amen
[1:54:13] hallelujah
[1:54:14] and he took that curse earth brother
[1:54:16] branham said he took cursed earth
[1:54:20] down to the jordan river
[1:54:24] and made it obedient to the word of god
[1:54:27] and was washed in the river jordan by
[1:54:30] the prophet
[1:54:33] and yielded himself up to be filled with
[1:54:36] the spirit of god
[1:54:40] the first of the cursed earth
[1:54:44] to be redeemed
[1:54:46] so that out of there would come the
[1:54:47] elements of the water the blood and the
[1:54:49] spirit to bring for the bride the people
[1:54:53] of the resurrection who would have the
[1:54:55] same life he has
[1:55:06] there's a real people
[1:55:07] who'll be in this real heaven
[1:55:10] with the real jesus
[1:55:13] so heaven is just full of spirits
[1:55:15] brother tim and people are disembodied
[1:55:17] spirits you know brother branham once
[1:55:18] thought that
[1:55:20] but he went there and he said they could
[1:55:22] be felt in the touch
[1:55:25] but i know of one man that's there
[1:55:28] the man christ jesus
[1:55:31] who raised from the dead
[1:55:33] and became the intercessor between god
[1:55:36] the spirit god and man so that he is a
[1:55:40] man could make perpetuation for your
[1:55:42] sins
[1:55:44] there's a man there
[1:55:49] and when stephen was departing he saw
[1:55:51] him there
[1:55:54] he was really there
[1:55:57] wasn't an imagination he was there i see
[1:55:59] jesus
[1:56:01] standing at the right hand of the father
[1:56:04] i see him as the way the approach to god
[1:56:07] i see him as the only visible
[1:56:10] manifestation of the almighty
[1:56:14] where god became tangible
[1:56:18] but there are real people
[1:56:20] that be in a real heaven
[1:56:22] with jesus a bride who will be united
[1:56:24] with her groom
[1:56:26] strolling together with the other saints
[1:56:29] of the ages
[1:56:30] sharing their story
[1:56:33] how that god loved them
[1:56:35] how special he was to them
[1:56:37] sharing the memories of life together
[1:56:42] let me tell you this is how brother
[1:56:43] branham imagined heaven after he was
[1:56:45] there he tells us right after being
[1:56:48] there and and he goes to he goes to
[1:56:50] imagining and trying to explain you know
[1:56:54] i'm trying to put it out i have to be in
[1:56:57] there how it how it would be
[1:57:00] and he said in the message adoption he
[1:57:03] said after we just put on this glorified
[1:57:05] body and the great age that's to come
[1:57:07] when this glorified body this celestial
[1:57:10] body has been made a glorified body
[1:57:13] then i'll walk home and say brother
[1:57:15] neville
[1:57:16] brother humes
[1:57:17] let's go up to papa this morning he's
[1:57:20] god we know him now
[1:57:22] he's a savior he's a healer
[1:57:26] there you know there was and then he
[1:57:28] breaks off into this let me read it
[1:57:30] there never was such a thing as a
[1:57:31] creation of sin
[1:57:33] well that didn't go down good did it sin
[1:57:36] is not a creation not for sin is a
[1:57:38] perversion
[1:57:39] there's only one creator that's god
[1:57:42] sin is righteousness perverted what is
[1:57:45] adultery righteousness perverted what is
[1:57:47] lie it's the truth misrepresented
[1:57:49] certainly what is a cursed world is
[1:57:52] god's blessing turned to a curse
[1:57:54] to a curse word
[1:57:56] to god instead of a blessing
[1:57:58] you see
[1:57:59] a sin is not a creation
[1:58:02] sin is a perversion so satan could not
[1:58:05] create sin he can only pervert what god
[1:58:08] created that's exactly right and death
[1:58:10] is only a perversion of life
[1:58:13] notice he said i walk up and i say
[1:58:15] brother humes
[1:58:16] let's you and i and brother beeler
[1:58:19] some of the brethren
[1:58:20] we'll go up to papa god and say
[1:58:23] let's take a little journey
[1:58:25] hey boys you like the mountains
[1:58:28] when you were mortal
[1:58:30] you know i always like the mountain i
[1:58:32] like looking at them i never so much
[1:58:35] enjoyed climbing them
[1:58:36] or falling down them
[1:58:39] but i sure like looking at them
[1:58:41] be wonderful to be able to climb them
[1:58:44] and
[1:58:44] go up into the heights of them
[1:58:47] you boys like mountains when you were
[1:58:50] when you were mortal
[1:58:52] yeah we sure did
[1:58:54] whoa well there's a couple of million
[1:58:56] miles of them out there in this new
[1:58:58] world go ahead
[1:59:00] let's roam over them
[1:59:03] and he says he tells us that right while
[1:59:06] they're out there roaming to the
[1:59:08] mountain god is right present
[1:59:11] he said while they're yet speaking i'll
[1:59:13] hear isaiah 66.
[1:59:15] so there's no distance think of this no
[1:59:18] distance you can walk slowly and enjoy
[1:59:21] and stroll over this heaven and walk
[1:59:24] through its great gardens or you can
[1:59:26] travel like a thought
[1:59:31] and he said and you know all of us were
[1:59:34] walking
[1:59:35] there just about 500 years
[1:59:41] a little learned it's just a little
[1:59:43] journey he said or maybe a million don't
[1:59:45] make any difference
[1:59:48] i know i know it sounds crazy but it's
[1:59:50] the truth because there's no time it's
[1:59:51] eternity
[1:59:53] and as we're walking along you know who
[1:59:55] we meet out there i said well if that
[1:59:58] ain't sister georgie bruce now she's one
[2:00:00] of the spiritual ladies in brandon
[2:00:02] tabernacle
[2:00:03] while sister georgie you've been been a
[2:00:06] long time since i've seen you look but
[2:00:08] she looked just like oh she was always
[2:00:12] and maybe she's 10 million years old but

[2:00:34] down here about 500 years looking around
[2:00:37] he said now i know that's crazy but it's
[2:00:39] the truth
[2:00:41] sounds crazy but it's the truth exactly
[2:00:43] that's the way god intended it
[2:00:46] well bless your heart sister georgia
[2:00:48] there's no harm can come nothing at all
[2:00:51] and in the evening time
[2:00:53] we'll go up to the mountain and say oh
[2:00:57] papa god
[2:00:58] i once was lost
[2:01:00] i once was in the muck of sin papa god
[2:01:03] and you saved me

[2:01:47] hallelujah
[2:01:48] amen you would rather
[2:01:51] go to hell
[2:01:53] than to live in heaven by yourself
[2:01:56] you wanted me with you
[2:02:04] greater worship than an angel an angel
[2:02:07] don't know what grace is
[2:02:09] he don't know what it means to be saved
[2:02:12] that's why the angels we sing about will
[2:02:15] bow their heads and listen because they
[2:02:18] cannot join that song
[2:02:20] because they don't know what it means to
[2:02:22] be redeemed
[2:02:24] amen they don't know what it means to
[2:02:26] have been lost and now saved
[2:02:30] he says here's what the best of this
[2:02:32] life can give you
[2:02:34] and he talks about the colgate dump
[2:02:37] being the stinkiness place i ever was at
[2:02:40] well i don't know about colgate i've
[2:02:42] never been there
[2:02:44] but i've been around an old paper meal
[2:02:50] man
[2:02:51] i don't know how the people live around
[2:02:53] it
[2:02:54] some men will get and they live up there
[2:02:56] and they make their living there and
[2:02:58] they'll walk out
[2:02:59] smells like bacon to me
[2:03:01] don't sound like any bacon i would smell
[2:03:03] like any bacon i'd want to touch
[2:03:09] but he said that old smoke just makes me
[2:03:12] sick to smell it and laying down there
[2:03:14] and that old smoke so sick to your
[2:03:17] stomach
[2:03:18] your stomach's just turning inside out
[2:03:21] like after taking castor oil
[2:03:25] you're just as sick as you can be and
[2:03:27] rats running all over you trying to eat
[2:03:30] on you that's the best of life

[2:03:42] running all over you trying to eat you
[2:03:45] that's the best of this life
[2:03:47] those rats are diseases
[2:03:50] they are cancers
[2:03:51] coveted viruses
[2:03:53] flu
[2:03:54] tuberculosis measles whooping cough
[2:03:58] diabetes whatever they attack you
[2:04:03] they pull in your body until it can't
[2:04:06] hold life any longer
[2:04:13] you get old and you can't help yourself
[2:04:19] i'm not old but i've i've been some
[2:04:22] places where old people are
[2:04:26] no i'm not in denial i'm not old
[2:04:32] but i watch these men you know come in
[2:04:34] sometimes the same clinic that i've been
[2:04:36] in
[2:04:38] and they walk
[2:04:46] and i look at them
[2:04:48] and i look at this tall
[2:04:50] what used to be a great frame
[2:04:53] big muscles

[2:05:11] and pounds and huge huge things
[2:05:16] men that was athletes and let me tell
[2:05:17] you you may be an athlete today

[2:05:30] the room
[2:05:32] because rats are eating your body
[2:05:40] that's the worst of this life
[2:05:43] but think of this then somebody reach

[2:07:08] in the laodicean church book brother
[2:07:10] branham said this is the last warning
[2:07:14] and maybe it is for you today
[2:07:16] it could be your last one and that's let
[2:07:18] me say we are here in the laodicean age
[2:07:21] this is the last message
[2:07:23] there will not be god speaking to
[2:07:25] another age
[2:07:27] the last messenger has come
[2:07:30] he has gave the message from jesus
[2:07:32] christ to the age of this people in this
[2:07:35] last day
[2:07:36] he told us how they would be lukewarm
[2:07:39] and cold and and how that they would be
[2:07:41] christ's rejecters and put him on the
[2:07:43] outside and he would stand on the door
[2:07:45] knocking
[2:07:47] he told us the condition of this age and
[2:07:50] we're here
[2:07:53] but he also told us there's going to be
[2:07:54] overcomers in this thing
[2:07:58] and he said this is the last warning
[2:08:00] there will not be another the throne
[2:08:03] room has been set up
[2:08:05] the 12 foundations have been laid
[2:08:09] the streets of gold have been paid
[2:08:18] you know i heard the story of a man
[2:08:20] who went to heaven and he insisted on
[2:08:23] taking his gold with him
[2:08:27] he's got his little bag of gold and i'm
[2:08:29] not
[2:08:31] i'm not going to leave it
[2:08:33] leave it here
[2:08:34] so he takes it with him
[2:08:37] you know how the stories go he gets to
[2:08:39] the pearly gates
[2:08:42] and the angel said well
[2:08:45] what do you got
[2:08:47] well
[2:08:49] you can't break nothing here
[2:08:51] what do you got that you're bringing
[2:08:54] let me see it
[2:08:57] opens it up pavement
[2:09:02] pavement
[2:09:03] you brought pavement
[2:09:06] this is what we walk on here
[2:09:11] the treasures that we think are so great
[2:09:15] will be just pavement under our feet
[2:09:18] you'll be nothing
[2:09:20] compared to the glory there
[2:09:22] [Applause]
[2:09:30] the streets of gold
[2:09:33] have been laid
[2:09:35] i'm telling you what your prophet told
[2:09:37] you president that the heaven is ready
[2:09:40] for
[2:09:42] the gates of giant gigantic pearls are
[2:09:44] way raised and hinged
[2:09:48] i often wonder why gates of pearls
[2:09:52] why are there gates of piles brother tim
[2:09:55] well of course pearls are beautiful
[2:10:00] they're lovely
[2:10:01] but why
[2:10:03] why gates of pearls
[2:10:07] do you know how a pearl is made
[2:10:11] a pearl is made
[2:10:13] when a little helpless oyster
[2:10:16] or shellfish
[2:10:18] laying there in the sand
[2:10:21] down in this ocean
[2:10:25] and grains come across
[2:10:27] and float down a sand
[2:10:31] and he can't don't have hands to get rid
[2:10:33] of this
[2:10:35] sand
[2:10:37] so that
[2:10:39] the little oyster
[2:10:41] puts a little substance over it
[2:10:44] a little liquid over it and smooths it
[2:10:46] over and it just keeps building around
[2:10:48] and around that irritant
[2:10:51] and that irritant becomes
[2:10:54] apparel and i think of gates of pearl
[2:10:57] just think about
[2:10:59] the gates of pearl the entrance there
[2:11:02] our character got molded
[2:11:06] you stop those irritants those trials
[2:11:09] we're going to destroy you they ain't
[2:11:11] going to destroy you
[2:11:13] they make a pearl under the entrance of
[2:11:16] a character where you'll enjoy the
[2:11:18] blessings of heaven forever
[2:11:20] [Music]
[2:11:23] the gates
[2:11:24] of pearls
[2:11:26] are raised and hinged
[2:11:29] like a pyramid she stands
[2:11:32] so fair and glorious
[2:11:35] the heavenly beings who have prepared or
[2:11:37] watched breathlessly for she glistens
[2:11:40] and shines
[2:11:42] with the glory that is
[2:11:44] unearthy
[2:11:45] every facet of her beauty tells a story
[2:11:49] of amazing grace
[2:11:51] 12 foundations representing the 12
[2:11:54] apostles and 12 patriarchs and all the
[2:11:57] other gates are all that way you know
[2:12:00] every facet of her beauty tells the
[2:12:02] story of god's great grace and
[2:12:05] redemption
[2:12:06] she is a city prepared for prepared
[2:12:10] people
[2:12:12] she awaits only for her inhabitants oh
[2:12:15] do you know where we're at
[2:12:18] the gates
[2:12:19] are hung

[2:12:56] not speak in another age the ages

[2:13:09] if this is the last message from jesus
[2:13:11] himself to the laodicean messenger

[2:13:22] that can turn your heart back to faith

[2:14:00] spirit form to the church
[2:14:02] to come and dwell in the church
[2:14:04] to embody her for seven ages

[2:14:52] one designation left
[2:14:54] we will meet him
[2:14:56] i want you to meet me
[2:14:58] in the air
[2:15:02] but you can't meet me without a change
[2:15:05] you got to change these old vile bodies
[2:15:08] and they got to be changed from mortal
[2:15:11] to immortality
[2:15:13] once about your heads just for a moment
[2:15:21] i want you to think on this
[2:15:32] say well i'm a good person
[2:15:36] good person to go to hell
[2:15:39] the bible said there is none that doeth
[2:15:41] good
[2:15:43] there is none that righteous no not one
[2:15:49] don't you try to make it on your own
[2:15:51] merits
[2:15:53] oh brother tim this is not a very deep
[2:15:55] sermon this is more deeper than you
[2:15:57] think
[2:15:59] if you missed this you missed everything
[2:16:04] if he's not the lord of your life this
[2:16:06] morning
[2:16:09] if he's not a ruler over those
[2:16:12] habits over that sin in your life but
[2:16:14] with that unbelief
[2:16:17] it's time to make him ruler
[2:16:22] you can't remain in the condition you
[2:16:25] are
[2:16:29] and meet god
[2:16:34] you've got to make your call in an
[2:16:36] election sure
[2:16:38] listen i i just had a man down here been
[2:16:41] around the message for years and years
[2:16:43] been a preacher
