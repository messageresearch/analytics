your glory and for your honor Lord touch each one we pray by your presence Lord have we felt you how we've seen you already Lord we just know Lord you have something for us tonight or we just look with great anticipation in Jesus name man it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen turning our Bibles to Psalms chapter 119. amen Psalms 119 and 103 says how sweet are thy words into my taste a sweeter than the honey to my mouth through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way the word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path amen God bless you today you can be seated actually today you had studied something else out and uh Lord I hit a quote and it just sparked something and this flame got a little brighter and hotter than the other one so we put the other one back over there and we'll pick it up later but I just want to speak to you on flight light footed light-footed the word is as a lamp as our scripture says the word is a lamp into my feet a lamp for the path we are on in life you know these lamps that David was speaking about if you you can put this in your mind it wasn't what we have today he didn't have a Q being back in that day or or some great Street lamp out there or something or something that would illuminate a whole stadium but they had little lamps that would they would put in some little cruise that was a little small vessel and they would put in it all and now that oil they would lay a wick it would come out and they'd kind of learn to squeeze I was looking at them today they would learn to squeeze one end of it to where the the wick could lay out the end and they would light it because that Wick would pull that oil up and that was what gave the light but these lamps that David was speaking of was not the bright beams of light we have today but it was a light that they used in that day and it would give out the light enough for each step for each step and as you would move one step it would illuminate the next step that's how God is you know he don't always tell you how everything's going to work out or how everything in between you're coming out and you're going in is going to be but he gives a word or a lamp to light up every step so that you can be with you can have assurance that when you put your foot on something that is solid and it won't slip amen little light in this lamp will light your way to Deliverance it may not light up the whole path where you see it see it actually all the things take place and how you're going to get there but it will light your way up to Deliverance it will light your way up to heal him it'll light your way up to the Holy Ghost it'll light your way to the body change one step at a time amen you may not know what it's all in front of you but you just keep on walking and as you walk it will be revealed unto you amen because this light has enough light for every step that you take but Brandon would use this and he said Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and to my path and you say well brother random I don't understand it all he said neither do I but I believe it and I know that that light is going to shine for me when I have need of it amen you know he's he's in this place he's telling them a story of being into in Kentucky somewhere and and there was this lady that came up a little barefooted girl and maybe about 15 years old and she had a little baby that had to pause him and he said what's the matter with the baby and said well she's got the jerks and she didn't know what to call it you know she didn't know the medical term but he said the little thing probably never had a pair of shoes on in her life some man's darling long hair hanging down I said Do you believe and she said yes sir I sure do believe and I looked at that baby and I took it and while I was praying it quit jerking and went out and the next day I was up squirrel hunting and over on the side of the mountain I heard some men sitting there talking and a saw got to buzzing and I slipped down out of where I was hunting and I've been squirrel hunting and I I I walked down to where they was at and he said I realized they was talking about me and they were sitting there too with the chew of tobacco spitting leaves are flying like that and they were talking about that baby that was prayed for and he said one of them said I've seen that baby and I went by there this morning and it's not jerking yet this morning said whatever that was that was real hey and so they had rifles leaning against the tree he said so I thought I better make myself known you know and said I I they had feuds down in that area he said so I walked up and I said good morning brother and a good fella big fella seemed to be speaking he had a chew at the back in his mouth and out out the side of you know coming out spitting in the in the and the leaves there and swallowing it and carrying home and uh and all of a sudden he looked around though and he seen brother Branham standing there and it reached up and got his hat off and jerked it off because he recognized who he was and he swallowed that O2 at the back and said good morning Parson he said respect that's right how are you ever gonna how he ever lived over it I don't know but he did but he said you know the next night coming back there was a man that wanted to argue with me with what had happened and he said he went to a church that didn't believe in Divine Healing and it was a Methodist Church there in white Hill Kentucky as he was standing outside he had a lantern in his hand and he said I want to say something preacher I just can't accept it because I can't see it I said you can't see it he said no I'm a sick man myself but I just can't see heal him I just can't see where God can do it I said where do you live and he said well back over there somewhere and said well now how are you going to get home well I'm going to walk home can you see your way home no sir I said yep it's an awful dark night tonight and cloudy and no moon out and said yes how are you going to get home he said buy this Lantern I said the lantern doesn't show light all the way to the house amen I said how do you how do you go he said I will walk by the lantern I said that's it you've got to walk got the light of the lantern now and every time you step this way the light will keep showing right ahead of you amen if you just keep walking the light will keep going with you Hallelujah and do and you do that this morning he said if you want Christ the great high priest the intercessor for your sickness or disease or or for your soul you may not understand it or but we're commanded to walk in the light as he is alive and you make one step in the light and when you get to that light when you got that light with you the light will shine all the way to perfect day amen so that's how it is it isn't that we can see all the way from here to our healing or all the week from here to our deliverance but we got the light with us and the light is going to lead us and it's going to guide us and it's going to be with us because his word promised it he said I'll never leave you or forsake you so if you take one step it's going to illuminate the next step and you're gonna have enough Faith to take the next step and you're going to keep walking until one day you walk into your healing or one day you're walking the holy ghost or one day you walk into your body change amen and I believe that's the way it is happening this word is a illuminated a group of people amen it may not illuminate and tell us what year he's coming or or what day it's going to be but we're going to take one step at a time one service at a time from Glory unto Glory unto the light illuminates that glorious day and the dead in Christ Rises hallelujah amen I I was reading about these things and I looked in Psalms 19 and verse 8 it says the statues of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes so it's Illuminating the path it's giving you the eyes to see in Psalms 43 and verse 3. it said oh send out thy light and thy truth let them Lead Me come on now is that what we want to be led by I mean it's tired of getting led by your thoughts amen getting led by your passion or your pride or or your arrogance or whatever Amen Let the word of God lead me let the light of God light my path and let them bring me unto thy Holy Hill and to thy Tabernacles amen this light has a destination amen it's not leading us to our destruction it's leading us to our deliverance amen it's not leading you to your death it's leading you to your healing it's not leading you to your defeat it's leading you to your Victory amen this light has a destination it'll bring me into the holy hills and to thy Tabernacle then will I go into the altar of God unto God my Exceed in Joy yeah upon the heart will I praise thee Oh God my God why art thou cast down on my soul why aren't there disquieting Within Me hoping God for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance Hallelujah the health of my countenance and my God so this this God this light is is to light our path it's a it's to show us the way to go amen we we have a lantern but we're not walking blindly amen our eyes have been opened we're in darkness but we also have light amen we're walking in the light as he is the light and he's guiding us to a destination amen he hasn't brought us to this place and and decided you know what I just give up no he has got a destination in mind he has got a purpose in mind for every one of you in here he has a purpose in mind he has a destination in mind and listen the darkness does not amen determine your destination the light determines your destination the darkness does not determine who you are the light determines who you are the darkness did not determine whether you die or whether you live the light determines that Hallelujah God is the light and you know I found as I was looking at this and now we know this story and I just want to bring it back to your members God's light is a light to his people but his Darkness to their enemy amen hallelujah listen I'm just going to forewarn you get your shoes on this ain't the service to kick back and relax no we're on a flight amen Exodus 14 and verse 9 said the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel moved and went behind them and the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood between them behind them and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that no one came near one of the other all the night Hallelujah this angel of God is your light but it's a Darkness to your enemy he knows how to give you light but he knows how to confuse your enemy he knows how to give you light but he knows how to defeat your enemy he knows how to give you light but he knows how to take your enemy down and bring him into the position and place he was called to be this light is Illuminating you but it's Darkness to your foe Hallelujah you know the devil usually starts that little flare brother Brown says but watch it he tries to cut off every move of God every time he'll do that and he's still the same devil uses the same techniques as he did in the old days still use them today if we can only read that Old Testament then we would learn the tactics of the devil and how he does it so we found out he had power and that power was death all right that powers of death but he had no power beyond that just death ends his power then beyond that but beyond death Faith sees God's Resurrection amen there's a light that carries on beyond death amen there's a light that illuminates the believer to believe there's something more than death come on now this Faith sees God's Resurrection after the faith after the devil's end of the power of death and he's finished and the devil can do no more but after death Faith sees a resurrection God of Resurrection That's The Power of Faith to believe and and he said when he says standing over behind the Dark Cloud that you can't see with your natural eyes but Faith directs you to look beyond the clouds come on now look behind the Dark Cloud and you will see you may not see it with your natural eye but faith is standing there to direct you to the god of Resurrection the God of all wisdom who is ordained your path and he's standing just behind every trial hmm this God is standing behind every trial he is trying to tell you tonight just keep walking The Next Step you don't know might be your victory The Next Step might be though it may be over with it may be done with he may be finished with but whatever you do don't stop keep walking keep moving towards it put a well body before you and begin to walk towards it Hallelujah amen so he says oh I love that don't you this God has ordained our path so if he's ordained it he's got enough to light it up he's got enough to lead you and guide you he's not going to let you fall off a cliff somewhere to know that Peter said that every trial's worth is worth more to us than gold for it's working he said every son that cometh to God he said you know it must be the scores or tried or chastised he said if you get a little heartache after you get born again a little trial to upset you somewhere and you run back into the world again it shows you wasn't a child to begin with you're an illegitimate child not a child of God but if a man once anchors his heart against the heart of Calvary all devils in hell will never Shake him no more he's there didn't mean you wouldn't have trials they mean you wouldn't have heartaches doesn't mean you wouldn't be tempted but you're there amen you're there amen it won't Shake him notice he can for he that cannot change stand chastisement it's an illegitimate child he claims God to be his father when he's not just tossed about by every wind of doctor not stable don't know where you're going double minded a lot of times double tongue and don't know where you're standing or what you're talking about then a man that's been born again of the spirit of God knows exactly where he's at see by faith he sees God no matter what he's in you may not see him with these eyes tonight but you can see him by the lamp by the faith amen listen this he said how that Faith confounded Pharaoh how Pharaoh raised up Joseph right in his castle fed him gave him the best made a good strong man Adam lived 120 years that devil raising up the child of God to do the work of God how God pulled the wool right over his eyes right at that time we find out that the children of Israel how that they were led into this trap no way at all ever to get through it dark there laid the Red Sea the mountains on either side Pharaoh's arms behind them thousand times thousands of armored men come chasing right up look like God LED them right into a trap you know we find out that God sometimes leads us into a great thing into it what looks like a trap or what looks like destruction but it is only to show his power and His glory to deliver us amen then we this is that what not what happened to them they didn't have enough light to know they was fixing to hit a Red Sea no the Red Sea just came before them they didn't realize it was happening until they got there amen amen but God already knew the Red Sea was there he already knew your sickness was there he already knew your trial was there he already knew your Temptation was there he already knows all about it he may not show you but he's given you the chance to show him you have the faith to believe no matter what's going on we find out we find out that he told him to take a staff in his hand and raise his hands and go forward and the pillar Fighters leave that great Shekinah Glory there in them was a form or a pillar fire going before them turned and went back behind to the Egyptians coming it became Darkness but it would give light to Israel he said the very Plan of Salvation of God when a man shuts his heart up against God's plan he becomes in darkness God is away his past finding out but when a man rejects light there's nothing else but Darkness same way it is now sent a friend of mine tonight when you spurn love you must stand in judgment no way out of it God gives you love first offers it to you first but you spurn it then it's judgment but notice the host of pharaoh who had seen the supernatural done but they just believed it and they shut up their compassion to it and they rejected it and they started out to even slay the ones that God was working with listen to this now a beautiful type of what's Happening Here in America though what is going to happen in America one of these days the very program that for years they've tried to tag them on all kinds of things call them crazy call them Holy Rollers all kinds of names they shut up their lights to them but thanks be to God the great Pillar of Fire is leading this church right on amen the very same light that made a path for Israel to walk in blinded the eyes of pharaoh the very same Waters of judgment that drowned the whole world saved Noah and his family the very holy ghost that you laugh at and make fun of and the power Divine Healing will take the church in a Rapture one day amen it'll take the church and the Rapture one day and leave you here to go through the judgments think of it what a day it'll be when you spurn the mercy and then Jesus said they'll say give us some of your oil and say go by and while they were gone to try to buy the bridegroom come he goes on down we get down to it here Moses went forth packing his rod and we find out the Red Sea opened because A Mighty Wind followed that fire that light of God when men walk in the light then the wind follows Jesus said Terry in Jerusalem to endure with power on high they waited for the light and the wind came amen they walked in the light to the wind began to blow just step in the light tonight if you're outside of Christ the winds will come back again like they were on the day of Pentecost just keep walking in the light he said notice the children of Israel walked across the Red Sea not only they wasn't in mud they was in dry ground walking in light that's a trouble with the church you're so loaded down you can't walk light oh he changed it on us amen you're so loaded down you can't walk by got too many things on you too much hanging around Paul said let us lay aside ever wait amen right now is the time to lay aside bitterness and unbelief and your own ideas and in your own consciousness how do you think this service is going to go how you think tomorrow is going to be and how you can't he said don't worry about tomorrow leave it for yourself today has enough trouble let's worry about right now in this service right now what is God going to do in this service how many lives are going to be healed in this service how many lives are going to be delivered in this service I mean it's going to be changed in this service I mean it's going to be moved by the spirit of God in this service [Applause] now amen this is what he said we got too many things hanging on us he said you need to walk light footed walk in the light light-footed what is the service for why is the word come to shine light and it shines light on you and it illuminates things that ought not be there that's the time not to get mad about it that's the time to shake them off amen because God is enough thought of you amen you know if we quit looking at it as somebody studied this so they could take their sermon out of this maybe God anointed a man amen because he had you in his mind think about that amen that kind of turns a little different table on the devil and what he tries to tell in our minds he's so quick to minimize everything else and minimize the movement of the spirit move minimize the Vindication minimize the word and maximize our excuses amen and we've got all kind of excuse why I didn't get it here and why this didn't happen here and why this said I was preaching to the young people there in Ohio and I brought out the man who laid at the pool of Bethesda and he's laying there for 38 years he didn't have to lay there for 38 years but he's laughing you know why because he had excuses amen Jesus knew this and he comes to him and he asked him this question do you want to be healed now you'd think that would be an obvious answer to that because a man been laying there 38 years but what did he say he didn't say yes he didn't say no he said I I would but I have nobody to take me to the pool I would but I someone I try to get there somebody's already in the pool and I have no wonder all kinds of excuses begin to flow out of his life why I can't get it why it can't be why it ain't for me why this and why that amen take your wise out of it amen take your excuses out of it tonight and say God illuminate my life so I can shake off the heavy the burdens and shake off the things of this world and become light-footed walking in the lights walk in the light light-footed he said do you ever walk when you go down the street singing feel my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly Dove let me go all the while with a song and a smile feel my way every day with love wow do you ever walk like that light-footed well I remember the night when I first got saved went back to a little shed I never did pray in my life but I was going to write Jesus a letter and Tack it on a tree so he could find it I didn't know how to pray I thought he'd pass by that tree sometimes and he'd see my letter what a dirty guy was and how low down and how weren't worthy if he's a man he'd talk like a man but I I didn't know how to talk and I knelt down one day in an old grass sack on that old wet shed I began to pull my finger I said Mr Jesus would you come here just a minute I want to talk to you amen but he came that's the main thing he said I think if we'd quit rhyming our prayers and trying to tease somebody's ears and pray from the depths of our heart like an old-fashioned centered ought to repent and pray God will hear us too much of this put on Pharisee I told you the other day of Pharisee means an actor to put many a Pharisees quit putting on quit putting all I don't like that stuff be what you are be original God knows what you are anyhow you're only acting before somebody else he knows what you are originally notice they were

down there and preach the gospel and he gets off of a ship and it goes together some wood because they've been out in the sea and he's called and he grabbed some wood and a snake bites him what do you do with that snake he shook him off why because the word of God didn't fail the word did tell them you're going to Rome you're going to be there and so he had enough faith in what God told him to shake the devil off amen I can tell you the word of God has illuminated enough to let us know the bride is going in a Rapture I went in a Rapture I'm going in a body change hey if I do go by the grave I'm coming up again am I winner either way but I can tell you right now if you got enough Faith to believe that tonight you can take that old snake that's been after you and Shake him off [Applause]

Crow will come and it'll try to Peck at that eagle and try to hit it that eagle and it'll actually get on him and try to ride him he said but that eagle don't strive with the crow he don't hit back at the crow all that eagle knows just set its wings and it starts rising and as it rises higher then the crow might be fighting it just keeps flopping it's wind keeps moving in the presence of God because it no sooner or later it's going to get so high the Crow's gonna fall off because the crow was not built for that atmosphere but the eagle was built to be there hallelujah amen you might have come in here with a lot of crows on your back and been trying to torment you and pull at you I say fly high fly into the heavenlies fly into the atmospheres of God and those things will fall off of you and you'll walk out of here with joy unspeakable and full of Glory hallelujah amen come on elt we're not built for the Earth We're not from Earthbound creature we're not some other bound chicken

they were wrong there was an old mule packing a backslid and Prophet one time he got scared of the angel of God because he could see the angel amen these horses knew they were doing wrong and that makes it right amen he says well and it makes it and these horses knew they do it wrong the Bible said that makes it right if the Bible said the Bible said that he frightened Pharaoh's horses they were so long going they didn't know but the horses knew more than they did the same road that carried Israel the father of the light following God carried them the perfect Victory it's the same road that killed the Egyptians and drowned them in the Red Sea hallelujah amen this same pathway that we're on this layout of seeing age that we're all this place that we're at amen God has opened up the Red Sea he's making a way where there seems to be no way it don't seem to be no way for a body change but God's making a way it don't seem to be no way for people to be healed by cancer but God's making a way they don't seem to be no way that anybody's going to be saved but God's making a way and he's made this way for your Victory and he's made this way for Satan's defeat he has invited them into this place he's allowed them to come into this realm for their defeat Pretenders this and this the same road carried one and killed one he said I believe they went through there in the spirit hello he's not believe they went through the Red Sea in the spirit he said you know that's what's the matter with the church today it don't get in the spirit enough we're too much in ourselves yeah yeah yeah if you'll just get out of yourself long enough [Laughter] get out of your feelings long enough get out of your pride long enough get out of yourself long enough I was hearing one little girl's testimony I may have told this Sunday I told her to somebody I told her son if I'm gonna tell you if I did them tell the Wednesday I don't care listen to brother Jeremy Shriner's testimonies of his children one brother Jason's I said she wanted to have Deliverance she had complexes she said she's seen all these other kids dancing over their enemy and she desired it so for herself she said all of a sudden hey I don't remember the whole story but all I know is she said all I know is I ended up out in the aisle and I'm shouting the Victory and I don't know what I'm doing I don't know how I got there I'm looking at my feet and saying how are they doing this he said I was just going and she said you know it didn't end there she said the services ended we got in the car and we went to the hotel the next morning my sister got to sing in one of them songs of Victory the next thing not know it got my feet again she said I tore that hotel room up all over again hallelujah hallelujah we can get the flesh out of the shoes and get the Holy Ghost in the shoes come on and we can get ourselves out of ourselves and get the Holy Ghost poured in there enough amen there'll be something taking place [Music] well you know how our church is we have a regular routine direct quote who cares about your routine I wish you would get out of the routine long enough to get saved anyhow get saved get out of the routine we don't care about the routine get in the spirit of God amen he said a one Prophet one time got all stirred up because somebody came to it and it wasn't right for him to come and he got his righteous ignination up you know what he did before the Spirit came on him he got to sing in some good old songs got some music going on then he got in the spirit and began to see things he saw Vision I tell you brother life will look a lot different when the church gets in the spirit and gets out of itself and the routine you're in Hallelujah lay aside those weights they aside those things that are holding you by give time for an old-fashioned heartfelt pouring out to the Lord Jesus unto the Holy Ghost pours back into your soul and you'll get beside yourself Maybe you can't be with yourself and Jesus you got to find out you're the biggest enemy you got oh the devil wants to point well that's the enemy and that one said this and that one said that no yourself is the biggest enemy you got yourself keeps you from getting what yourself should have needed amen lay aside those weights see they started on light-footed feeling wonderful they were following the pillar of fire going God going before them and when he cut away to the Red Sea she's walled up and they got on the other side got back to Earth again their feet back on the ground they looked around after the spirit went off them and they seen what happened and here it come all over again oh Hallelujah don't you think one service ought to be this and another service all but let's Let It Be how the spirit wants it to be amen let's let God be going to get moving our midst and all of a sudden we see the enemy slaying around us amen it ought to stir something on the inside of us it ought to cause something that could take off something to go it said that's what happened he said they saw their enemy Dead all around them and the spirit started moving again laughs yes sir Miriam tambourine and all she got so excited she grabbed a tambourine and began to beat that tambourine and dance the daughters of Israel followed up down the banks beating the tambourine and dancing if that ain't an old-fashioned Pentecostal camp meeting I never seen one in my life brother if this is the latter rain that must have been the former rain hallelujah what is it the same Holy Ghost the same Pillar of Fire the same Redeemer walking in the light moving on what a Time what a time what a time I love that when we come out of a service and say what a time God moved Among Us he said listen he said when the Great Shepherd was smitten that great sheep Shepherd when he was smitten back there and he said it is finished at that minute as soon as the shepherd was smitten it was over with sin was settled there was no more sin they were clean the penalty was paid the Believers whose names were written on the Book of Life predestinated from the foundation of the world it was finished the very minute Jesus said it was finished so listen you are dealing with a finished enemy your healing is already done your deliverance is already done how can you say that because he said it's finished it's over with the great Shepherd that came down for a sheep and it was finished God's right hand was pulled out of his bosom smitten then on Easter he returned and he raised up again to his bosom and extended down to you and I in the form of his word to redeem us back to the original Garden from which sin took us from he said no wonder the mountains jumped and shouted on that day no wonder the sun hid his face and screamed for Joy no wonder all nature broke loose and wind Shook and shooked and Shook and joyed and junk they seen the prophet Shepherd on the mountain redeem every name that was in The Book of Life Hallelujah and not only that they seen that their own nature was also redeemed oh God if it can make a earth shout he can make the sun shout if he can make trees shout and jump for joy what it ought to do for the living creatures of almighty God that were placed upon this Earth to be born in the image of God it ought to make something on the inside of us when we look back and we see our enemies dead and we catch a glimpse of our name written in the book Hallelujah why are you going to make it because my name's written why are you going to be there because my name's written why are you still overcoming because my name's been written down and they ain't enough devil eraser to take it off he said I've seen Joy jumping spells and joy spells but there was nobody heard the mountains rung out the sun went down everything but nobody was hurt I've seen meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world hello free from the world and things of the world and the joy of the Lord filled the congregation they stood and screamed and cried and shouted at the top of their voice for the glory of God I never did see anything disorderly there was always right in order because they had recognized their name was written in the last book of life and that Prophet Shepherd Prophet had brought them the message and they were delivered no matter what the other eggless at cholesterol rounds said about it Ecclesiastes around Etc they knew what had happened that's why it doesn't matter what anybody says about my joy because I know what happened exactly right brother Joe it ain't their Joy is mine it ain't their peace it's mine it ain't their love it's mine it ain't their compassion it's am I it ain't their Holy Ghost it's mine but if they'll ever get a hold of some of it it'll do the same thing it'll move in them it'll cause the joy bells of Heaven to ring out in their soul and things begin to pop and Shake things begin to move amen Lil's begin to come up and give praise to almighty God Amen why because they now see there wasn't some old trodden down nobody the devil been trying to tell them all their life the devil been trying to tell them it wasn't for them and they couldn't make it and they wasn't going to make it and if they tried they might as well quit because when they're going to they're going to quit just sooner or later you're going to quit sooner or later you're going to give up sooner or later you're going to stop sooner or later this that and the other shut up devil Hallelujah you've called me all kinds of names you call me every kind of thing in the book and one day that might have been who I was but today that's not who I am I have seen what God called me wrote in the Lamb's Book of Life he called me Victorious he called me an overcomer he called me delivered he called me healed he said it was done [Applause] laughs let me read this one he goes on down he starts talking about those are on the right road to Emmaus said they had just witnessed one of the greatest things that had ever happened the greatest thing that ever happened in history of mankind they witnessed a man go up to the Old Rugged Cross and be nailed and die and say it's finished laid in the Tomb they'd heard the words that he had spoke destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up I have power to lay my life down and I have power to raise it up again but all of that left them here they found themselves in a place of Darkness in a place of confusion in place of something had taken place and they couldn't understand it and they they didn't know he didn't know you know what what how's this going to all work out now we we thought he was going to be this and we thought it was going to be that and we thought for sure this was going to happen and it didn't happen and their minds all on all kinds of things of things that didn't work out according to them and according to them it was all Darkness it was all bitterness it was all hurt it was all this or that and the other but all of a sudden as they're talking about him here's steps one out of the bushes and he just kind of joins himself to their company and he begins to talk when he said why are you so sad why are you so so sad what is going on that you're you're so down on the dumps about well are you not from here have you have you not heard how how how this happened they go explaining all of this and he starts going back to all the way back in history but not does he begin to explain all the things that went on the prophets that spoke about it and he brought him all the way down to where present time see God's not interested in leaving you in history he wants to bring light to now and so he brings it to this point and the Bible says he started to go on as it made us he would go on and they they grabbed the hold of him they pulled and said no come inside and he'd come inside and and he began to speak to him and and the Bible said he began to break bread as he as he did we know what that had to be I mean there was only one that could break a piece of bread another piece of beer amen he broke the bread and the Miracle took place and there and the Bible says they've got to hear their eyes were open all of a sudden the word became a light to their path and brother Branham said they got real light-footed because they realized they wasn't dealing now with a god of history or a god of yesterday or a God that was in the grave they now had a God that arose from the grave and then they realized that if he rose from the grave he was the god of the Resurrection so if he was the god of the resurrection and they would have and God would be their God then that made them part of the Resurrection and he said if anybody ought to be light-footed in this day that we're living in he said don't why are you worried about it why you he said you know what you're going to get to the other side and you're going to say these when you look back and you see what you went through and you're going to he said you're going to look back and you're going to say why did I fear I missed out on so much joy right there wow wow amen when we look back and we see God walking with us and he was talking with us and he was explaining himself oh God let her eyes come open tonight amen we have a risen resurrected Christ among us our eyes ought to be down and disheartened and on this problem in that situation our eyes ought to turn to a resurrected Christ and if he's a resurrected Christ today and you are resurrected people and you know the god that brought you out of sin and it brought you out of darkness and he brought you out of denominational system he brought you out of everything the devil tried to set a trap for you he brought you through and if he brought you to now he'll take you all the way it ought to make you light-footed and put your shoes on your feet to know God's with me and God's lead me and God's guide me amen I might have lost this one or this one might have walked away but my God is with me [Applause] my God is with me let me go through a few scriptures we bring this down Isaiah 42 and verse 16. I back up what Psalms 112 and 4 unto the upright there Rises light in the darkness because God is gracious and full of compassion and righteous Isaiah 42 and 16 said I will bring the Blind by way they knew not I will lead them in past that they have not known I will make Darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will I do unto them and not forsake them Micah 7 and verse 8 Rejoice not against Me O My Enemy when I fall I shall rise that ought to put some joy in somebody's heart you may feel like you're falling but oh you need to look at that image I'm gonna rise when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be enlightened unto me Hallelujah Luke 1 and 78 says through the tender mercy of our God whereby the Dayspring from on high has visited us to give us light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace laughs alms 18 and verse 28 for thou will light my candor if your Candle is lit this evening Who lit it thou would light my candle the Lord my God will Enlighten my darkness for by Thee I have warned through a troop and by my God I have leaped over a wall let's get life-footed that enemy had surrounded you and built a wall around you he'd put a troop all the way around you he'd try to keep you hemmed in and say this is all you could ever be you'd never amount to nothing but God is my light and he illuminated my path where I could run through that truth and I can leap over that wall and jump into his arms of victory as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all those that trust him for who is God save the Lord for who is a rock Save Our God it is God that girdeth me his strength and maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like Heinz feet that means fast Fleet of foot Hallelujah I don't told you the devil don't know who he's missing with messing with he gonna get his high run slap over he gonna try to put up one last blockade from this body taking the change and it's going to leave tread marks all over him oh brother it won't say Good Year it won't say Firestone it'll say the grace of the Living God say the power of the Living God it'll say God is for me who can be against me and it run right over his high amen he maketh my feed like Heinz feet and setteth me up on my high places he teaches my hand to war so that the boy still is broken by my arm thou has also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand is holding me up and thy gentleness has made me great thou has enlarged my steps unto me that my feet did not slip I have pursued my enemies and overtake them taking them neither did I turn again to they were all consumed I have wounded them that they may were not able to rise and they are Fallen under my feet for thou has girded me with strength into the battle that has subdued unto me those that rose up against me thou has also given me the necks of my enemy that I might destroy them that hate me who you talking about brother Timothy the devil not talking about somebody I'm talking about the devil second Corinthians 4 6 says for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power of May It Be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body so we have the death but we have a life the resurrection for we which live are always delivered unto the death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according is written I believe therefore I've spoken we also believe therefore we speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things of our for your sake that the abundance of Grace might do the Thanksgiving of many abroad to the glory of Lord of God for which cause we faint not but through our outward man perish at the n-word man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment working for us are far more exceeding internal weight of Glory while we look at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen the things which are seen are temporary but the things which are not seen are eternal we found out the grave was a temporary grave but the resurrection is eternal Resurrection your formal life was a temporary lie but the new life is a is a resurrected life it's an eternal life that is burning on the inside of you laughs I'll tell you what and I'm gonna win right here with this got a lot more things here but Sunday I was speaking on the spark and I went to uh I went out to eat with brother Derek and his wife in Shreveport they need to pick up some things for their shop it opened on Monday and here there we're sitting at the restaurant with two of their daughters sister Rebecca and sister Anna and we're waiting I don't know if he's waiting on a food got her food I don't remember but all of a sudden I started hearing a song and I started hearing sister Rebecca Adams actually sing There Ain't No Grave gonna hold this body down and I thought what in the world they're playing Christian music in here and uh because you know it's been country music or whatever I hadn't really been paying paying attention to what was going on and I I'm trying to kind of all of a sudden you kind of went away from me and I looked brother Derek was talking to his wife said did y'all did y'all did y'all see that light flash oh did y'all see that light flashing sister Rebecca said obviously she acknowledged said yes I saw it and so they saw I thought it was Mom's phone she's like no what y'all saw a lighter with my phone I was I I hadn't turned my flashlight on but I realized something was taking place the the spark the resurrecting power is Among Us amen and I know God had done some powerful things that evening and but I think God's wanting to do more than just all that I got to thinking about that there was a song my brother Philip sang and his family there there ain't no gray there the same song kind of but it's a little different type so There Ain't No Grave gonna hold this body down and it says since you walked out of the Grave I'm walking too if you walked out of the Grave I'm walking too and though I'm telling you today it started rolling through me as I began to study this on being light-footed as these men begin to realize there's a resurrected Christ Among Us it ain't a dead living Creed it ain't a dead God it ain't a God of History it ain't a God of yesterday or a god of tomorrow it's a god of right now I don't know you ought to put some George shoes on somebody's feet Amen to make them light-footed when they shake off those heavy baths and they shake off that Spirit of nervousness and fear and they begin to realize God is a god of resurrection and if he walked out of the Grave I'm walking too hallelujah how many here tonight say God you walked out I'm walking out because you
