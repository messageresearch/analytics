bodies Has Come Today to give you more we ask him to stay but we want to stay in his presence and let's just speak to the Lord today I believe that we are walking right in the predestinated moments of time and he's a good god let's just speak to him Lord Jesus Lord you see these things Lord Jesus that are laid here before your children Lord Jesus these moments of time father Lord Jesus that we're standing in and we recognize Lord Jesus that it's you that is here father and Lord we look upon a dying generation that has missed the presence of the Living God Lord we're very aware Lord Jesus said

prayer cloths and things father Lord you see the need Lord and you're greater than any need Lord Jesus you are the all-sufficient one the almighty and we invite you to come and take the pulpit now father Lord speak through human lips One More Time Lord Jesus what a privilege it is for us as your children to be gathered under the revealed word of this hour we pray Lord that you administer to your children today by the help of the lord we commit this service unto you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen and a bride said amen if you have your Bibles this morning we'd like to look over in the Book of Genesis chapter 15 Genesis chapter 15 and then down to habakkuk chapter 2. certainly want to say it is certainly our our honor and our privilege to be standing here before you today we certainly appreciate brother Timothy and brother Tim for the invitation for being able to come and address this portion of the Bride of Jesus Christ and we know it's our it's our greatest honor to be standing with him in this hour it's a great honor to be standing with these brothers but it is my greatest honor to be identified for my Lord Jesus Christ and I certainly appreciate these these all of these brothers here there's not enough words in my vocabulary that I could express how much I appreciate every one of these brothers and their Ministries and their gifts and it's it's just uh it's God's dress wear and we're certainly we're certainly privileged to be friends and with these brothers brother Lawson and we certainly certainly loved last night and we're looking forward to to today I'd like to I'd like to speak to you today or on on this thought of the effect of the vision the effect of the vision and this will kind of be like riding a new horse if you ever rode one and sometimes sometimes you got to get a little bit adjusted to you so uh y'all just help me ride this thing today hey man Genesis chapter 15 and verse 1. some of y'all understand what I'm saying right there some of you don't that's okay as long as the angels in charge and he's got to Reigns we'll be all right amen Genesis chapter 15 and verse 1 and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward right there brother Branham would say he said how can Satan hit you if he is your Shield and Abram said Lord God what will thou give me see and I go childless and the steward of my house is Eliezer of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine Heir you see right there in the humanity Abraham would have failed but you see the Covenant was unconditional aren't you thankful and behold the word of the Lord came unto him and saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine Heir and he brought him forth abroad and said Lord look now towards heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness Abacus chapter 2. in verse 2 we recognize that a vision is a forecast of future events it foretells the thing before it happens the vision foretells a thing before it happens and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readathy for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord we recognize today that we are standing in a very special spot as the Bride of Jesus Christ that we recognize that the Holy Ghost is in the power is the power within the Church of the Living God and we recognize that that we're not just speaking or addressing just any any church group but we are speaking to a Divinity class of people a very prophetic class of people that understand that they have been brought up higher by a message of Malachi 4 that has turned their hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and we recognize that there's a lot of people that look upon the same word that you read and they cannot understand and they cannot recognize it because Revelation has not struck their heart but we recognize that Paul would tell us over in the book of Corinthians that the veil is upon their hearts and they're blinded to these things even when Moses would be read in the Old Testament that that there there was a veil that was upon their face but we recognize that that where we are we are seeing him not through a glass Darkly but we're recognizing that we have been speaking to the son of man we've been speaking to the one that created the heavens and the Earth we've been speaking to him face to face but if you go to reading over there that you'll watch that that Paul was standing there and he said that when he said when it is turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away and we recognize what Malachi 4's Ministry is to do it's to turn the hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers so we recognize that our hearts have been turned to be able to understand where we've been feeding at we are not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and only a select people can understand and what is being said here and we recognize as the Bride of Jesus Christ that we are here living out the very vision of God and we understand that that God's God's prophecy or his his cogs of Prophecy brother random would say he said they're slow but they're sure there's one thing for sure that if God said it you can believe it and you can go to the bank on it it might seem like you get you might get caught up in the delay of time and wondering where God is and wondering where the promise is at I'd say that Abraham had some moments had some moments in his life when he was wondering where is the vision at but notice God never got upset about his promise because the promise was unconditional and God is not excited about what's happening down here in laodicea God isn't succumb about where you are and where you are in your life and where you are in your spiritual life or where you are the natural God knows exactly where you are and if God got Isaac to come through what men said was impossible God has a way of getting this not dressed put her in a Rapture he has a way to make sure that you make the body change God ain't shook up about the vision God he took about where you are he took up about our prodocus isn't shook up about our healing he hasn't shook about the Masterpiece she is struck off of him and the vision has got to speak he may look like Isaac is never coming and it may look like Ishmael would get there before Isaac but the blessing is of old Isaac the blessing ain't on the Pentecostals the blessing is upon this bride we're not just addressing anybody but this is a prophetic group of people that understand that the vision has spoken about us and it's a vision that spoke about us we've only got one destiny to go to and that's the rapture let hail come let high water come the vision has been spoke about you I'm not worried about young girls what they're battling with I'm not worried about young boys about what they're battling with God is the author ity Hallelujah you see to those that are predestinated to see it they'll see it because it's the word that is joining with the word it can't do nothing else we recognize that that you know these things and I'm not going to spend much time on these things but I'm going to drive some things this morning but we recognize that when in the days of Samuel that the word of the Lord was precious in those days you see even when when Samuel was there in the house of Eli and he was there and he was under the training of the priesthood he was standing there he was laying there at night and the Lord began to speak to Samuel about about the things that and begin to speak unto him and we recognize that the Bible tells us in first Samuel 3 3 and 1 that the word of the Lord who was precious in those days because there was no open vision and we recognize that the Bible tells us that where there is no vision that people perish and he recognize that that the church world can go no further than where they are because they have no vision before this day but God sent a prophet to this right you know there's a lot of people that won't understand him there's a lot of people that that can even understand that William Branham was a prophet but they can't understand that he was a prophet messenger they can look upon his Visions they can look upon his healings but they don't recognize that this was the prophet Messenger to this age you see there's a lot of people that stood there under the first and second pool but where are they at now but there is another people in the land today who under their Messenger will be the final boss and you're not running without a message said hey you are running with the greatest message that's ever been loosed out of this loose out of the mouth of God this was not William Branham the man's message this was God's message and if I'm going to be identified with anything in this state let me be identified with the message of an Angel and if the angel said that I would repeat that if the angel says for me if the angel said it's for you I'm not gonna let one complex send in my way I'm not going to let what anxiety stand in my way I'm not going to let anyone of My Flesh read his eyes stand in my way and I'm gonna stand right here and I'm going to believe this word it's time like never before that we preach this message why don't you the coming of the Lord let's not get shook up about where we are and let's create some message [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is [Applause] you see what they needed was the voice of God to meet the need of that hour we don't want no work up for the need of the album we don't want no intellectual speech for the need of the hour we want the vision to speak we recognize that we're right here in the hour of the vision where Luther can't run with this the Westlands can't run with this but it takes a very special class of people and you can imagine how how great that we feel to be able to come into Expressions recognize that he's here recognize this is his anointing recognize it then ask the Praises of God as we begin to praise the Great I Am that His blessings begin to come down upon the Church of the Living God but can you imagine God's anticipation for his children to be gathered under the word of this howling and to think you know we we just want to stay right here we want to live right here we we don't want to go back out to the world we don't want to go back to Monday we don't want to go back to our work but can you imagine the very mindset of God I have finally got a people that are mouth of my mouth their word of my word I have held the Seven Stars in my hands and I waited to release him at a certain spot and he watched Paul go out and watch Luther he watched Wesley but could you imagine as he's releasing the seven star from his hand that this will be the final group this will be the group and this will be the messenger and he's built him in such a way to draw a certain class of people it might be a bunch of nuts to a bunch of to a bunch of Pentecostals you might be a bunch of odd boss to the rest of the world but you're exactly what God was looking for that's all you Innovation and you're going to run with this message [Applause] his anticipation that underneath underneath the Paw would come polycarp that would be elect would catch the message of the day you see what it was he was the Holy Spirit building a body all through every age the Philadelphian age he was building a body the Sumerian age he was building a body and you watch as the elect of that age catch the message or catch the revelation of where they were you watch under Wesley you watch men like Spurgeon infinity and Wigglesworth I said as they are getting there and they're wrapping up the message of their day but here we are in a lap over and here we are we recognize that the church is right here we're standing right here and brother random told us in the invisible Union with a bride he said God slipped on your hand before the foundation of the world the wedding band of unmerited Grace he knew you before the foundation Lord [Applause] I could take his same message and I could preach it down to the Pentecostals and he wouldn't do nothing for them I could take your same message and preach it down to the Baptist and he wouldn't do nothing for them because they can't understand what I'm saying of him but because you're a two-world kind of people because you understand there's reality and there's a physicality and you recognize that hell cannot handle the reality of this vision [Applause] I just give you a mouthful hell cannot handle the reality of this vision [Applause] but because you are who you are because you know who you know because you've been fellowshipping like Abraham was fellowshipping he was up there feeding and feasting with Melchizedek and becomes because he was a player and God took he took 16 elements and he blew himself a body and he walked up there and he had a conversation he grabbed this Angel and he grabbed that angel and he stepped into a body now watch what brother random said he said after Abraham had his name changed he was April but he couldn't produce what he was supposed to produce and let he head out until he had a name change brother Madam said and then Abram was in condition to meet Melchizedek and because a prophet stood over you and said I'll no longer call you church but I'll call you Brian you're able to stand here and recognize that you are in condition for the Revelation to come foreign let me drop just a few things right here as we're building this he said then Abram Abraham he said when you watch the revelation of who he was he said then he was able to call him Lord he said there was three Angels out there he said but because he caught the Revelation because he wasn't conditioned he said his vision and his Revelations lined up lined up because you see the effect of the Revelation and what we're preaching to these young kids they know who God is you can shut down every trinitarian with one of these young boys because the effect of the revelation when you think about William Branham standing there you can hear it tape after tape and he's dealing with a patient and he's watching he's watching as the angel of the Lord begins to move him he's moving him into a realm a Divine gift he's operating right here by the window and he's operating he said and we're all very aware he said I'm standing into Worlds you can go listen to deep calleth to the deep and he's standing there he and he and he comes back around and he says is this the patient because you see he's in Two Worlds at the same time and he's standing there he said now you see now a vision doesn't heal you but a vision allows you to see that it's a finished work of power in Calvary a vision is a word of knowledge that you know that he's still Hebrews 4 and 12 and it's some it's somebody it's somebody that's in condition to be able to receive that you are a people of Two Worlds [Applause] yeah foreign it's dropping into your heart to be able to foresee that something has told you or something that will be you see you can have somebody you could have somebody stand up you can have somebody stand up that would be that would be standing there you take a person that may that may be dying or take a person that's got a dreadful be a disease upon their life and you watch as the man of the hour the prophet of this age would stand there and he would look and he said now he said now I see this and such and such in your life he said those things are laying there those I see I see I see this doctor that's got this tortoise shell glasses upon him and you've went here for this condition and that condition you're not from here you're from another place what was it it was the angel of the Lord that was directing the man of God to go down and grab something that would draw their attention that this was more than a man that was standing there you see the reason why you understand the revelation of the seventh seals is because there's an Angel that's been dropping you that's been dropping you it's been dropping you purposes on hand he's has been watching over your life he's not allowing the things that have been built up in your life to hold you back what he's been dropping by your way it was a message that caught your attention Hallelujah that's why we didn't stand there and watch the first poll and the second poll but this third pool has caught the body of Jesus Christ I wasn't there in the meeting but the pool of the Holy Ghost has drawn us unto him I see this I see this he said now he said down here is standing a body that we've just talked about with this disease he said but up here is a well-body and he said Jesus is calling you to that well body [Applause] you see in in the age of Luther and Wesley there were things down here that you couldn't understand but God Jesus was calling you to a well-body to be able to operate with all of First Corinthians 12 visions and gifts and words of knowledge he could not operate Hallelujah he could not operate the way that he wanted to through the Wesleyan message we're not taken away from them but he finally has got a class of people that can understand what he's saying that can be the Dynamics that is not just mechanics but the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost is on the inside of this body she can walk in his name she can believe in his name she can speak in his name you remember when brother bisco gives his testimony that is that he goes and it begins he begins to go in there and grab those things and I certainly appreciate brother best school there's not another one like him in my opinion that's all right you ain't got to be yours it's mine I thank God for it but you I I just want to draw your attention to this one thing when brother Branham when brother Branham is standing there I believe it was the man that was a son worshiper that he looked there and that he was worshiping the Sun and his eyes were his eyes were went blinded out because he'd been looking at the sun and you remember brother by Adam said that I had I had been entertained by the James and the seats all day long he said but he said then it come the Holy Ghost turned to take the pulp in and he said I was standing there he said I was standing there and he said this man was standing up before me and this is what I want to draw your attention to he said brother mystical said that brother Branham told him he said because I saw a vision of that man he said I was able to make a challenge like I made he said where is the gods of the James if the gods of the Sikhs can stand up here and they can heal this man let him come he said but if not let Lord our Lord Jesus Christ come and do the work for the mystical said that brother random told him said he looked up there in a vision and he seen that man that that man had those gray hair in his in his sideburns so he was looking at a vision and he was able to tell him your whole in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now if God is still there if God was God there isn't he God right here and there's been a vision that's been spoke over this body you're not going down in defeat you're going up in Victory you're not going to lose you are going to win you're not going to you're not going to go into the tribulation Brad there's no way he can send you through persecution when you're his wife you've received his love letter man told us he said now he said God gave us five senses to be able to contact our Earthly home of sea tasteful smelling here he gave us those angels He said but if God put something on the inside of you sister to be able to look into another realm to be able to contact that world and to think that brother Madam said that when you have the Holy Ghost you are a candidate for the Unseen World so you understand what I'm saying to you today that your Miracle is already in the room sure is defeated in this room powers and demonstrations are in this room tongues are in this room Visions are in this room knowledge is in this room your body changes in this room it's the angel of the Covenant that is called you into a world that knows that knows you're going to make it the angel ain't scared the angel ain't worried about your healing the angel ain't worried about your loved one he knows where they are thank you William Brandon I believe it's 1954 he's standing there and he begins to tell us he begins to tell us that he's sitting there in the audience and he said he said I see I see a doctor that's working on a little girl and she's paralyzed she's paralyzed from her shoulders down he's working he's working on her tonsils and something goes wrong and now she's paralyzed from the shoulders down now when brother Brandon begins to speak yet he said that there came a lady running from the back and said where the brown brother random that's my girl that's my girl is she made whole is she made whole he said he says I said I can't say I can't say one way or another whether she is or not he said only way he said I don't have a gift of teaching or a gift of preaching he said but I have a gift of Visions he said but he said I don't know whether she's healed or not and they begin to call another patient and he said all of a sudden materializing in the building was a car and a road that was going down that road and it was sitting out there and he watched that little girl walking down that road holding a little baby doll in her hand and she began to scream what was it it was the effect of the vision now you know if I say something to you about your children it would move you if I tell you that now you don't have to worry about the confidence that's in your family don't you have you don't have to tell your children don't you be worried about your confidence it's already there it would affect you in such a way that you would know that he's talking about me [Applause] I could say something about you and it'd be completely off and it wouldn't affect you one way but you let something be said about you let it be done to your children it affects your life when the angel said that I would be in this meeting and I'd be standing here with Wayne Lawson standing here with Ron Spencer and we would taste the taste of Victory I say the addition has affected my heart there's been a vision over this meeting it's a first time Wayne Lawson brother Ron and myself has ever spoken a meeting brother Nani was supposed to be here and we certainly miss you but God knew that God knew the circumstances he's got sister Erica Parker he's got he's got everything in control for Donnie Reagan but God had something in mind for this meeting when brother Ron was back maybe about a year ago and maybe I'm telling stories out of school right here and maybe I'm getting ahead of the gun but I believe that I believe I'm right into this thank you Wayne Lawson and Ron Spitzer myself walk in and we begin to eat on a honey bun and brother Wayne says Brother on don't you think don't you think you shouldn't be having that he's old brother Wayne don't you know I'm cancer-free now I ain't sat down at no table and I ain't ate no honey bun with these three brothers but I believe that this is sweeter than a honey bun I believe but this is honey from the rock that there's healing that is the bread of the children and I believe there ain't nothing too hard for my God if he could walk up there and talk his hair and said is there anything too hard for the Lord Sarah it's time that you recognize that your Miracle is in the room stop trying to have it through Hagar stop trying to have it through the handmaiden let the birth of the Holy Ghost move you into a vision foreign you know what that does to me that's the son of Ron Spencer it affects me but nothing affects my soul greater than to watch one of these brothers and to watch one of these sisters get so filled with the Holy Ghost that they'll never have to go back there and sin no more they'll not walk out in depression no more then I walk out of anxiety no more then I walk out there and be bothered by those things no more suicide last no hold in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so it affects me knowing that God has not forgotten us and there is such a liberty in this message that's bringing us right into the vision I don't want let the critics do what they're going to do we have been stimulated by the Revelation and we are filled with the Holy Ghost and it brings stimulations of God's house [Applause] oh you see It came it can't affect you it can't affect you what critics are saying about you because you're an eagle an eagle flies above the storm an eagle has a way to pierce through the darkness an eagle has a way to go through the clouds and the clouds of life and then not affects you all you got to do is set your wings you're not going to go home the same way you came here the vision that spoke differently you may not have met everything that you got you have need of but God's got something out in front of you brother Joshua that is greater than you've ever experienced in your life this is that that was prophesied by the prophet Jehovah and I'm so crazy enough to believe that if you could get any prodigal in this building tonight get them in here and watch the Power of the Holy Ghost it is the effect of a vision this horse is riding all right but let's take it all the way in to the coming of the Lord whom the men say that I am some say Jones some say John the Baptist but whom do you say what do you say brother Isaiah what do you say about this I say that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God I say unto you that Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this unto you and and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it you're not just being built upon some cold ideal formal idea where we're just working you up under the atmosphere of the music there ain't one that the music's being played right now but there's such a power that's called this body to her feet it's the word Dawning with the word let me tell you the message that you're riding on here to take care of your family here to take care of your parents it'll take care of you young girls it'll take care of you if you if you're right on this message it'll take care of everything it's just a charity he this faith that you have is the master of all circumstances so no matter what the circumstances is the revelation of faith that instructs in your heart is greater than the circumstances foreign this ain't man constructed this ain't Tim Pruitt's building this ain't Tim Pruitt's Vision this is God's vision and I'll tell you what these are my buddies but I stand up for the anointing and I'll stand here and you can say anything you want to about this but remember that you are not talking about a man you are talking about the son of man Noah I'm telling you go out there and preach the message and you get you get hot and bothered because your pastor preached the same thing for the last three weeks I ain't talking about Tim Pruitt I ain't talking about anybody maybe I'm talking about myself but you get all upset you get upset because your pastors preach the same thing he's come down the same line and he's walked down the aisle he's pointed his fingers spiritually at you and said wake up your dry bones but Noah was standing there for 120 years preaching the same message what's your message today it's gonna rain it's gonna rain and he knew only eight of his family was going to go in there but he preached the message I don't know who's going in and I don't know who's going out but I know this that if God got Noah in the boat and he got up more player on Mount of Iraq and he got him out he said God that can get you in and he's a God that can get you out she's born of his bowling she's life of his life she's power of his power we must be talking about Katie Spencer we must be talking about we must be talking about Connie Spencer we must be talking about this brother or that brother no we're talking about this body that is under this anointing that has set up a meeting that told you to accept the anointing let's finish this and that you are the anointed body of Jesus Christ and if you don't recognize her in the vision I don't know what you're doing you ain't got your eyes open but God is telling you let's finish this let's look on this race Hallelujah That's what Satan hates he hates this revelation amen when simeon's up there and it's been dropped in his heart that he would not die until he's seen the Lord's Christ it didn't matter how many babies visited the temple he knew he wasn't going by the way the grave until he seen the Messiah you cannot go down in defeat job was a man that went through a year of Trials when you read all those 42 chapters it seems a whole lot longer than a year but job went through all of those all of those stripes and brother Branham said that God had gave job a Channel of inspiration and when the inspiration began to fall and the Visions begin to flash and the pillar of fire and the Lightnings begin to flash he began to look at it that I know that my redeemer lives you let something drop in your heart right here this morning a channel inspiration that only you have and you'll watch healing come you'll watch Miracles come [Applause] I know what I'm talking about Satan hates when we go to preaching about this church can do the same thing that Jesus did that you can do like Mark 16 Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover what am I operating by I am operating by a vision that you can do the same works that he did in John 14 and 12 Satan hates when you go to talking about a body move not just in one man but in a mini member bride and she loves to lay in her hands upon her brother and upon her sister Satan hates when you start catching the Revelation that I am seeing [Applause] foreign told us he said he said Peter went up there and he preached and three thousand Souls were saved and Satan never got out of his bed he's somebody who gave a beautiful he walked past the pirate person to hate and he healed a man that been laying there for all of those years and he told him rise up Leah and he rise up in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ such as I have give I unto you but watch it it was operating in a body it was operating in a body Satan never got out of the bed for a preached word he said but you let the phenomena begin to happen you let what Malachi 4 came and preached to us come into fruition in this meeting and you watch every Rogue Hound of Hell begin to go down and so man it was nothing but a bunch of Pentecostal work up down there talking about miracles that's gone by let every Rogue hell go ahead and get started we're not going to back off preaching the message we're not going to back our preaching mark 16. do you recognize that the devil gets out of bed when you start accepting the anointing that you're in the vision I can lay my hands on this brother and watch him be healed why don't you step into the vision you are Satan's worst nightmare I'm talking about children you're Satan's worst nightmare Lily you are Satan's worst nightmare Rebecca you are Satan's worst nightmare throw your name right there you are Satan's worst nightmare this ain't just for Tim Pruitt this ain't just for Ron Spitzer this ain't just for Wayne Lawson this ain't just for Aaron Oglesby and any other brother here this is your anointing this is your power this is your vision [Applause] don't you love the Lord when Jesus was here when Jesus was here he said you have made the word of God of no effect by your traditions do you understand what effect he is it's the result my heart from exploding right here you are the result of the prophet's vision you've not made this message of no effect by your traditions of thanks and thinking it was just in 1965 when William Branham was here you have not made it of no offense but it has affected your soul just like when Isaiah was up there in Isaiah chapter six and brother random goes in there and he preaches on influence influence of another he said this man Isaiah was influenced by the king uziah that he'd watched him or he respected him he said but he got that Uzziah got his eyes on the wrong thing he got his eyes on the wrong thing he said but then there came a vision that came a vision and the spirit of the lord caught Isaiah up and he went up there and there was there was Angels flying that were covering their face they were covering their feet and they were screaming holy holy holy unto the Lord now brother man I'm sitting now you watch what the vision did he said it affected him so much that he confessed I am a sinner if we get to a spot that we think we're so high that we can't confess that we're Sinners saved by the grace of God if we get to a spot where we can't we can't welcome a prodigal or a prostitute walking in there and I know we ain't preaching to them to stay that way but we're not welcome them we're welcoming them in for a change but if we ever get to a spot that we can't breach salvation to the Lost we need to close our Bible up and shut it down not everybody's going to be bride but if I can do one thing to get somebody to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ who accept them as His Savior and accept him as a Healer let me get in the vision and let me preach the message the message I'm not worried about it let me just pass the net brother L and let it bring them in caught his attention it affected him so much that he said Hello whoa is me I am a man undone with unclean lips and I live amongst the unkling people there's a blood there's a blood there's an anointing that follows you that erases your past that erases your history it affected him so much that he knew that he was that he knew that he was in the presence of The Great I Am and it's affecting you I see it all over your face it's affecting you because you recognize this is more than Andrew Spencer that is speaking unto you but you recognize that you are in the presence of el shadiyah you are in The Presence of Jehovah Jireh if he could do it for Abraham he can do it for you he is Jehovah's Hammer the Lord is there and David said if I make my bed in hell Thou Art there if I ascended to the heights Thou Art there you are in The Presence of Jehovah Shalom he is my peace I am in the presence of the home episcopeneur I am in the presence of the great I have I am in the presence of the day spring I am in the presence of The Great I Am foreign what did it do it caused him to confess that he was a sinner if those angels could stand up there and they could scream holy holy holy holy to the Lord and it shake the doors of the post what about Sons and Daughters of God that's been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb they don't know nothing about Sin they don't know nothing about Redemption but you as a son and daughter of God know what it's like to be lost you know what it's like to be saved you know what it's like to be caught up out of the Maori Place how much more should I worship go forth if you just could shake the doorpost let's shake hell tonight let's shake down every Kingdom that Stacks itself up against the body of Jesus Christ let's shake down the doors let's worship him let's bust out the walls let's hang off the chandeliers let's worship the king of pigs Hallelujah don't hold it back let it go let it go let your worship loose that's your brains loose you are called to worship Him well When the Music's playing that's when I worship him right now it's a time to worship Him it's the words going forward we ain't shook up about when you go to dancing and screaming all over the place and

time to lesson let Heaven heal you let the Earth hear you let everything below you hear you it's your time to worship God has harmed a prayer you want me to pull out folks brother let him take it when the seals are released everything is worshiped this is the worst of the king of kings he said in the fourth seal he said in the fourth seal he said I know we got a lot of fanaticism he said I know we got a lot of fanaticists he said when the music gets a play and the emotions get to jump in his shouty he said then you'll watch them and the Music Stops and the day it stops but can I quote you your prophet he said that's all right if they're living right if you're living right you can dance to the sound of the music I'm gonna I'm so glad that I can say I want up here [Applause] it's time that

marching Onward Christian Soldiers marching as to war [Applause] where are we living at well there's somewhere we living at they can hit us with the quotes they can hit us with the criticism but God didn't build this body to listen to a bunch of quitters when we're a bunch of winners hey let them say what they want through about My Worship I ain't Worship in them and I ain't worshiping there I did [Applause] go ahead say what you want to I was built to worship Him and don't you don't you get upset when Nathans are rejoicing it's what they were called to do it's time that the Traditions speak it's time to division speaking Michelangelo Angelo had built the statue of Moses he'd spend his life building he spilled his life building and when he finally come to completion when he saw what he had in his mind and he looked at him and he smote it on the knee and said speak what was it that which he'd held in his mind all of those years finally come to a completion and brothers said that he was up there looking at that in those Gardens and he said it was a god that pointed out the more he said after he got under the influence of watching The Vision come to pass he smote it and he said speak he said but Michelangelo could never put that back he could never reproduce that he said but God's going to do it [Applause] it's not up to me God is building a body that is coming to coming to the end of this age and she's bold of his bone she's life of his life she produces Miracles because she operates in his name she believes in all things are possible because he's praying in his name she accepts everything that is said about her brother Adam said when we get in speaking conditions again it's time we start speaking what the vision has said [Applause] and it seems like nothing's ever going to happen but let the God come on and point out the masterpiece URC [Applause] your father didn't just believe this message was only for him he believed it that it would reach to his grandchildren foreign has already been spoken wait for it wait for it for it will not tarry but it will come to pass in its appointed time sister Esther the vision is ready to speak don't you hold it

gone by the way of the grief you'll bring your theophany to come and pick up your redeemed body but if you're here you'll take this redeemed body to meet your theophany [Applause] what's it like to
