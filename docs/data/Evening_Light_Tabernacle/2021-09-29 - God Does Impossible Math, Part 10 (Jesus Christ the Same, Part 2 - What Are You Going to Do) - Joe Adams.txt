the lord in prayer father what a blessed people we are lord lord and we see darkness upon the people and gross darkness upon this age and this hour yet we as a people that's experienced the light of your word and father what a blessed people we are lord we're not only blessed to be a people of the end time message but lord we're blessed to be a part of this fellowship here at evening like tabernacle we're blessed to have family here we're blessed to have friends lord we're blessed to have a comparable ministry lord we're blessed beyond measure father truly you have blessed each and every one that is present lord here tonight and those on the stream god we're so thankful and lord we don't want to uh take for granted the blessings that you bestowed upon us for you tell us that lord daily you will load us with benefits and lord with the benefits of being a christian a real believer lo god how we thank you today how we thank you lord that we're called according to your purpose sons and daughters of god knowing our position in the body we thank you for an end time message that positionally places us in our position for this hour for father so we ask tonight that you'll just come lord i ask you to come and be the speaker father i have done my part to study lord throughout the week making preparations for the service tonight and lord i'm just here to yield myself a vessel as an instrument of righteousness that you can speak through father not only speak through this vessel but i ask that you anoint the ears of the hero tonight god that we can both be in one accord that of the giving and that of the receiving of the word tonight so we just commit this service lord to you now we ask that you received all the honor all the glory and all the praise lord for we asking in jesus name amen and amen if you have your bibles tonight it is great to be here i mean how many are looking forward to our meetings next week amen i tell you i'm on a great expectation i was texting brother ron earlier to this evening he said it's gonna be epic i'm like man that's my expectation so the word for these meetings are epic so we want an epic outpouring of the holy ghost you say well brother joe that's not who i am will you let that epic outpouring fall on you and you may do something you didn't think you would do so i say lord that's where i'm at tonight i'm i'm looking for a great outpouring of the spirit of god and so whatever we have need of i believe he's here to minister to our needs we'll look here uh hebrews 13 and verse eight i know brother timothy has done an outstanding job on his uh sermons that he's been preaching on jesus christ the same so i want to speak to you tonight on god does impossible math part 10. jesus christ the same today part two but i want to give it a subtitle what are you going to do so i know that's a long title and it's saying a lot god does impossible may we never forget that god does the impossible but that god does the impossible through you and nothing is impossible for them that believe but also we must realize that jesus christ is the same today and i want our focus to be on what are you going to do so we read here in hebrews 13 and verse 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever god bless you you can have your seats tonight i'm also going to look at another another scripture reading here in luke 4 and verse 17 it says there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah's and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written written the lord is upon or the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor notice he hath anointed me he found his place in the scriptures and the place that he found was he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captive and the recovering of sight to the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised and to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and he sat down and all the eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this day 9 29 21 this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears so we find here in luke 14 jesus finding the place that pertains to his ministry and his commission to preach the gospel then we look over in mark 16 and verse 15 he said unto them he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature so we find in luke jesus finds his place he finds where he's been anointed to preach the gospel but not only that in mark 16 we find that he commissions his disciples that this very same things that he did they were to do also and it was not just to himself see where he preached the gospel he healed the brokenhearted he preached deliverance to the captive he gave sight to the blind he said it liberty those that were bruised and we found the very things that he did in the book of acts his disciples carried the same ministry on they did the same things that they saw him do so what we find is the book of acts was a continuation was the manifestation of jesus christ for their day for that day every day that they got up and somebody received healing that was jesus christ today and we find here in the message or in the exposition of the seven church ages i want you to listen to this and brother brown says he says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts so christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts so we're not being turned back to pentecost in an effort to start over all right no we're being turned back to pentecost so that we can continue the same works the same signs the same wonders that was poured out in the upper room that followed down through the the the disciples is the very same things that this end time bride is being turned back to we're being turned back to pentecost so we can continue the book of acts ministry so the same things that they did we are to do as well inside man he says we are his hands on earth we are his eyes on earth we are his gospel on earth and the gospel is not all together by the word he said the word made manifest is the gospel now i just started my timer so y'all got 10 minutes free but he said the word made manifest is the gospel so each of us we find through the through the scriptures and through the quotes that we have been commissioned to preach the gospel well you say brother joe i'm a female well i'm not talking about in that aspect some of you may never be called to stand behind this pulpit and take a thought and declare it to the people but that doesn't mean that you're not called to preach the gospel your life is called to manifest this book your life is called the manifest the end time message your life is the only book that some people will ever read and your life is preaching the gospel your life is manifesting what is in the word of god your life is bringing forth every promise of god your life is declared that he's the same today as he was yesterday your life does that by your faith to take god in his word and to manifest what he says and let this word do what it said it will do so we find by allowing the word to produce in you what it says that it will do is the gospel now we're going to go dig into this a little bit more tonight don't worry i'm not a teacher you don't have to get scared brother joe's a little bit slow tonight he's teaching no don't worry but we find in the body of believers there's healing all right in the body of believers there's discernment in the body of believers there's deliverance to those that have been bound captive in the body of believers there is liberty to those that have been bruised maybe you have a past but in the body of believers there's liberty from your past there's liberty from your failures there's liberty from your mistakes in the body of believers there is liberty for the sons and daughters of god see what the word did in christ or what christ manifested in the alpha church is to manifest in the omega church so that proves that he is the same today just as he was yesterday so christ doesn't change how happy can we be tonight we don't have to wonder we don't have to go and guess what will he do how would he respond what is god going to do you can comb through the pages of this bible and you can find exactly what is expected of you in this hour come on church he says in possessing of the enemy's gates listen what the prophet god would tell us 1959 he says in the church of the living god this morning lays the power to heal all sickness he didn't say in a prophet he said in the church of the living god he didn't say him brother aaron or brother tim or brother donny or brother ron brother timothy brother joe whoever your favorite preacher is he says in the church of the living god that's you tonight church you're the church of the living god in the church of the living god this morning lays the power to heal all sickness in the church of the living god lays power to overcome all temptation you hear that young men you hear that tonight when pornography is trying to grip your life in the church of the living god this morning lays the power to overcome every temptation in the possession of the church of the living god this morning lays the power to chain sin oh i like how he put that to chain sin where sin was had a chain around you there came an anointing and it broke that yoke off of you and now in the church of the living god this morning is that power to change sin and throw it away notice the power to change sin and throw it away and recede the baptism of the holy ghost in the church of jesus christ in the church of jesus christ and he goes on and he says whatsoever you desire whatsoever you desire ask in my name and it shall be given to you remember our focus tonight is what are you going to do what are you going to do see he says now he goes on to say in this message possessing of the enemy's gates he says i will verify myself that i am with you for these signs shall follow them that believe mark 16 and verse 15 and he said unto him go you into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and notice verse 17 verse 17 here and these signs shall follow them that believe these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues keep going on he says and they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and he sat down on the right hand of god and noticed and they went forth they went forth and preached everywhere their life manifested the gospel everywhere they went and the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following glory oh i love this i love this brother joe you're just an emotional type well i'm sorry i love this there's gonna be signs following the true believer there's times to follow the true believer so let me just tell you spoiler alert if your message or your ministry or your church don't have any signs following i wonder if there's a true ministry there i wonder where the holy ghost is because the scripture says that these signs shall follow the believer there's going to be healing there's going to be deliverance there's going to be casting out of them there's going to be speaking in tongues there's going to be a holy ghost anointing on the people there's going to be some emotion these signs shall follow the believer notice and he says now preach the gospel unto all the world and these signs shall follow them onto all the world everywhere this note he says everywhere this same sign the same gospel will be preached he says we passed out tracts all around the world but the gospel hasn't been preached one-third of it yet the gospel is not just the word only but it's the word made manifest see the power and the demonstration of the holy spirit bringing the word to pass then there's great lectures they can stand up here and they can preach they can read they got a human mind they can pull scriptures together they can take a concordance and tie this scripture to that scripture and look at the history and say it means this and it means that but that's not what we're asking that's not what we're talking about we're talking about a holy ghost anointing that when that word goes forth it does something to the hearer it sparks a faith inside that heart that i can be healed that i am healed i don't have to stay about i am delivered it preaches look liberty to those that were captive it breaks every yoke of sin and unbelief that's what preaching the gospel does for the believer not standing up here and saying i need you to turn to this scripture here and you know you can just listen to a big lecture and my all his intellect and everything and you think oh wow how fascinating he's so intelligent but if his ministry is not producing signs and wonders it's not of god sorry see the gospel is not just a word only but it's the word made manifest it's the power and demonstration of the holy spirit bringing the word to pass and the message is why am i praying for the sick he says but after all the passing out of tracks is not preaching the gospel the gospel came not in word only paul would say but through the power and demonstration of the holy ghost not just teach the word but preach make the word manifest that's what we want tonight you don't want brother timothy and brother aaron brother tim myself to stand up here and just preach to you some intellectual gospel that we just go through our 30 45 minutes some of us two hours of letting you hear this scripture and this quote and we just tie it all in and you leave out of here and he's like well i didn't get anything out of that but it was so pretty and it seemed to be put together so well and we grade the sermon based on all these key points and it does nothing for the inside let me tell you i don't care if that man knows how to say his abc's but the holy ghost can come behind it and signs and one is vindicated and the sick are healed and those that are bound are set free that's the kind of gospel i want i don't care if he's an intelligent man as long as he's got the holy ghost and the holy ghost is manifest and making that work come to be that's what we wanted even like tabernacle that's what we desire in our home we want the gospel preached signs and wonders manifesting in young people where sin had a whole sin had to give way because the holy ghost broke the yoke of sin off their lives oh hallelujah notice now the word itself excuse me is dead until it becomes into action this is in the india trip report he said the word itself is dead until it becomes in action and produces life but i got the bible but this is no good to you unless it's living through you do you hear me this is no but men lost their life because they manifested what was on the pages of this book you can take this book and throw it in a fire and go down to the store and buy the same exact copy but you take this book and put it on the heart on somebody who's on fire you can't burn it out of them no they'll give their life at the stake they'll die for this because why because it's not just pages or words on the pages of of a book it's a life that's being lived it's a life that's being manifest it's christ in word form becoming christ in flesh form it's no longer on the pages of a book it's no longer in the paint a history book now it's become a living god in a living people the word being made manifest unto an endtime people notice now he will say the word itself is dead until it becomes an action and produces life so the word must be made alive i ask you where is it going to be made alive tonight it can't live on the pages of this book because this book has no heartbeat this book has no life of its own it can't live in the past and we hear stories of what this one did and that one did those stories do you no good the only way that this book can be made alive or this word that can be made alive is for this word to come inside of that flesh and that flesh and that flesh and that flesh and manifest what this word declares that it will do what it says it will do he says now in the faith in action he says what good is going to what goes it going to do you to read of a historical god if he isn't the same god today what good is it going to read about old george washington if he's dead and gone it's just a history fact but jesus raised from the dead and he's the same today he says now what good is it going to do to paint a fire to a freezing man he's there shivering and we don't get very hard cold so you from uh canada you guys have just moved down here from the frozen north don't worry you're not gonna freeze down here it's not gonna get cold enough but you take a man up there and the snow's about six foot deep and you walk outside and it's 40 degrees below zero and you show him this beautiful picture of a fire that man don't want the pitcher he wants the fire and that's what i'm telling you tonight we don't want just lectures we don't want just people to stand behind the pulpit and can say this and say that we want the fire or the power of the living god manifest that's what's gonna warm this bride it ain't gonna be some story of yesterday but it's gonna be jesus christ today doing the very same thing in which he did yesterday he says now show him a picture of a nice big warm fire and that man's freezing that's some something that was he said that's what people are trying to keep you alive by today and i'm afraid that's what a lot of preachers are trying to keep us alive by today their their constituents is a god of 40 years ago what he did 40 years ago what about him today what about him today i'm thankful for a god that moved 40 50 60 years ago but i need a god today i need the same signs i need the same wonders i need the same power deliverance i need the same manifestation today your kids need the same manifestation today we can't just rely on a god of 40 and 50 years ago we need a personal god but i want you to know he's the same today he's the same god today he wasn't justin william branham he wasn't justin all these other men that was in the healing movement but he's in you this evening he's in your heart he's in your home he's in your life what is he doing brother he's bringing forth the word he's manifesting the gospel notice i'm afraid a lot of so-called message preachers have have failed to present the right thing brother bran will tell us this he goes that's what the people are trying to keep you alive by no wonder we got a failure in america of religion no one of the magazines serves as spiritual own go as a bust it's because they have failed to represent the right thing to them they're trying to teach them of a historical god and we find many people all this message is to them is god sent a prophet god sent a prophet god sent a prophet god sent a prophet god sent a prophet but who did he send that prophet to let's move past god sending the prophet and realized god sent a prophet yes but who did he send him to what purpose did he send him for we're going to get into that i'm glad you're asking all these great intuitive questions tonight so they can point you to a god 40 50 years ago but we can't get worn by a painted fire church oh it does your heart good to hear the tapes and listen to them and it serves your faith but what if he's not the same god today and all he is is a god of history a god of yesterday when you put on a 1962 or 63 because some people like it after the seal so let's go 63 march around 16 17 and we'll say everything past that point to 65 is all inspired by god how shameful are we gotten when we've taken it and narrowed it down and nitpicked it like that either he was a prophet or he wasn't a prophet either he was called of god he wasn't called to god but yet they want to say this is what we are this is my painted fire let me tell you i don't want a painted fire i want the god of william branham manifesting an evil like tabernacle i want the god of william brown manifesting in timothy pruitt and aaron oglesby and tim pruitt and joe adams in your life in my life in others life i want that same god on display i don't want him in history i want to call that god tonight up out of history and said be my god be my deliverer be my healer be my burden bear be the one that takes me on to the rapture another church that's what i'm looking for we want a living god not some historical artifact a living god a god who's still healed saved set free he says but what we need today is a god resurrected from the dead and on the right hand now to do whatever he promised he would do to confirm his word and catch this and we need delegates out there in the audience who's willing to rest their soul on any word that god said and put it in action oh my you mean it's more than just the preachers we need delegates let me just put it to you like he would say if he was here we need even like tabernacle the church members from the very front to the very back we need each of you here that is willing to rest your soul on any word that god said and put it into action so let me tell you it's time we quit talking about it it's time we quit saying oh i wish i could or i wish i did it's time to you put this word into action he says what we need today that's what we need is men and women who stand up to the forefront there and call the devil a liar call the devil our say jesus christ stripped you and robbed you of every right you had and i'm in christ jesus and the world belongs to me amen that's right it's time that some young people so i'm tired of this pornography having a grip on my life or this anxiety or this fear or this nervousness i'm tired of you o devil you're nothing but a liar i'm in jesus christ and he's alive today and he's manifesting through my life that's what we need the devil said he's going to shut up a womb but god says i'm the one that gives life come on even the like tabernacle it's time we declare that he's alive i'm not saying that we don't declare it but i'm saying look let's just have a refresher he is alive [Music] he's alive today faith in action 1955 he said he's alive today he's just saying jesus certainly he is if blind bartimaeus could trust him i can too if the woman with the blood is you can touch him touch his garment i can too see for he's open and willing and he's begging and accepting whosoever will let him come and drink are you thirsty tonight are you thirsty man i've been on a desert hot thirsty see this thirst won't quench but just for a few minutes but he can quench for a lifetime he can quench that deep desire so he lives today he said that's the way it is today you might send your seminary boys in there teach them all kinds of theology all about this and that and the other but if you're afraid to turn your faith loose to trust god what good does it to you what good does it do you to teach them he says what we need is to turn low he says what we need to turn loose is let your faith go into action and we're about to have some special meetings and sometimes we don't get excited some of us until it's our favorite preacher or it's a special meeting or we're going off somewhere and we're going to be a part of special meetings oh hit a nerve didn't i but he's the same god right here he's the same god i'm asking what are you going to do he's the same today what are you gonna do because that songwriter would would pin that song i can only imagine i can only imagine when i stand before him what am i gonna do i can tell you one thing i can get a prelim of how i act here i may do the very same thing over there they may see joe adams run over that hill and that hill and that and you know what spoiler alert i'm going to be able to sing on that side so you're going to find me not only dancing and running i'm going to be singing and shouting and praising god i can only imagine i know what i'm going to do i'm not going to sit by and let some rock climb my place i'm going to let some tree pray to my place i'm going to declare he's a living god he's a living manifested god and people today that's what i'm going to do i'm going to declare jesus christ is the same he's the same in principle he's the same in power he's the same in manifestation he's a saving spirit and he's here tonight i declare to you tonight church i'm not preaching a godly history i'm preaching about a present tense god he says you need to turn because what we need to turn loose is let your faith go into action he says now as shakespeare lived in me you would expect me to live like shakespeare to write poems and plays and things of that nature if beethoven lived in you you would be a great composer that beethoven was because beethoven lives in you you're not yourself now you're beethoven or your shakespeare but he said then if christ lives in you young people check up sometimes you think you get something and you don't have what you think you have but if the holy spirit truly lives in you then the life of christ he says that's just the way he lives in you but you can't live in there with him he's got to live in you see the difference you can't just live in him but he's got to come and live in you and when he lives in you he's going to manifest his word through you then the things that you used to look at you look at no more the things that you used to fear fear's been broken off of you because now the one who gives you overcoming power is no longer out there he's inside of here and now fear that once had you bound here is no longer there because there's a power here to break every yoke because he's not a dead god and he's not just a letter he's a living god notice mark 24 14 the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the income the gospel of the kingdom the gospel clue on these key words tonight the gospel of the kingdom shall be manifested the word shall be made alive not just in louisiana not just in tennessee not just in virginia ohio but into all the world the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached manifested demonstrated declare him to be the same so in the message missionary talk 1958 brother says now what is the gospel the word gospel means good news he said the good news is the bible but the bible is the letter and the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so the only way that the gospel could be preached in would be to manifest the power of the holy spirit all right y'all following me tonight he says so then what's the next equation he said and as a conjunction and these signs shall follow them that believe not these signs may follow them not these signs ought to follow them but they shall follow them that believe he says then strictly speaking 1958 march the 30th so the critics can go back to this because this is not brother joseph is the prophet of god he said then strictly speaking a man cannot qualify himself as a believer until this has happened until what the signs follow the believer so we can't qualify that we are a believer until signs and wonders are fine now i'm not saying everybody's going to be supernatural no but you're going to manifest this word you're going to believe this where you're not going to live a life that's hypocritical to the word of god your life is going to manifest all the promises of god you're not going to pro uh claim that you're this that and the other and you got some old crappy spirit are you some negative nancy or some debbie downer and i'll give you a few other names if y'all want them but no the gospel is joy unspeakable let me just tell you a story can i tell you all story yeah i can tell you story i'm the preacher tonight so i got the floor for 49 more minutes so i have a job i'm a cfo of the hospital right everybody knows that for the most part very stressful job especially when you ain't got no money to work with it's a highly stressful job and so my wife and i were contemplating what am i going to do do i need to quit do i need to walk away i got to stomp grinder i go make money doing that i'll have to beat the streets well beat the beat the stumps and so we're praying she's like you just quit i don't care something's got to change cause you got to come home happy because you all fouled up all the time cause i was stressed out how many of you ever been stressed out i'm just being personal can i be personal because some of y'all y'all need me to be personal like cause you got a frown on your face so let me just be personal so here i am i come home every day my kids don't want to be around me because i'm old crappy joke [Laughter] and that was a little emphatic amen there buddy well the truth hurts right my wife with us you did that for her yeah so i come home almost like every day for months and i just begin to say lord something's got to change well i woke up one morning in my devotion and i began to pray said god if you want me to stay at this hospital i've been there 23 years if you want me to remain at this hospital that i can make a difference in this hospital help this hospital turn the corner and be there to provide health care for our community in places where my family members my church members can come and receive good patient care then you got to take the stress away from me i began to pray directly specifically you say brother joe what are you going to do i had the promise i had the word of god ask what you willing to be given and i sat back and i was expecting god to do it all right and i began to say god if you want me there you've got to take this away let me move beyond the realm of stress and so i was down my sister jessica and i were preaching for brother danny steeman a couple months back and as i was preaching at the end i was bringing it to a close and i said something in the end of that service and i said that job situation that has you stressed out for so long and you can't get along with your family today is its last day and when i said that i promised y'all the spirit of god hit me and me and jessica connected eyes and it left it left hear me church it left so much so that just about three weeks ago i got a text from one of our senior leaders she said are you okay i said yeah why you asked cause you sure been acting different lately i'm like what do you mean she says well you just kind of seem like you're checked out so i begin to tell the story i'm not checked out i just ain't got no more stress and then i had one of my direct reports call me on the phone i took off a thursday a couple weeks ago because brother j.j salinas and his wife was here and i want to spend a day with him and i was taken off she called me she says you ain't going job hunting are you i'm like no why you asked she goes because you've been acting so different lately she's like you just seem to be happy and like you ain't worried about nothing do you got another job somewhere and i began to tell her the story she said i got goosebumps too that just makes me feel so good so what am i telling you i'm saying we want god to do it but god was waiting on me to ask he wanted me to ask because the gospel is not just signs and wonders but it's the things that you have need of god's able god's willing to take care of those needs if it's a job situation he's still jehovah jireh he still provides and now today i ain't got no cash in the bank and i still got a smile on my face i said i don't know how we're gonna do it but bless god if he can break two fishes and five loaves and feed five thousand he'd steal god for even like tabernacle he still can feed my family he still can provide for my family he's still able i'm going to tell you tonight he's still god and he does the impossibility you got a need tonight he's the need supplying god oh hallelujah he's a need supplying god and nothing here be church nothing is impossible if you can take god at his word oh yes [Applause] these signs shall follow them they can go in on the hospital morning no cash in the bank 12 million dollars in debt and say all right i'm glad to be here oh yeah my corporate office may not like that but whatever we got the wrong man in the job i said we can find somebody better please come on i don't think there's anybody better right now god put me there so we fine i heard brother ron speak this if y'all listen to his third part of his series that he just finished he says now these men who don't want archer calls these men who don't want prayer lines these men who don't want any emotion in the church no speaking in tongues these men don't have the holy ghost see if you don't believe i like how you said if you don't believe in the product then you can't sell it so if you don't believe in the holy ghost then you can't sell the holy ghost if you don't believe in a little bit of emotion that the holy ghost brings when the power of bondage is broken off somebody's life then you can't sell it to that congregation when you don't believe that he's still the same today you can't sell it to the people and the people sit there dan is midnight but if you can sell it because you believe it because it's manifested and it becomes a living gospel saying you can sell it to the young you can sell it to the old you can sell it to the sick you can sell it to the bank and it'll break the chains off their life branham would tell us like this in the horizon of the sun he said the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he is risen amen to prove that he is risen can we prove that he has risen if there's nothing flowing from our ministries from our life if there's no signs of life how can we prove and declare brothers that he's risen if there's no signs there's no wonders there's no tongue there's no supernatural display of the spirit see but i'm here to declare tonight he's not dead but he is alive and this church has witnessed one miracle after another one supernatural occurrence after another one healing after another discernment after another because why the gospel is being preached it's being manifested brother would tell us the word of god made manifest is the gospel he said you're you're hankering down on that one or anchoring down on that one tonight i'm kind of like brother brother aaron priest to y'all this power to us this past sunday i'm going to preach it to you till you get it remember what brother tim said years ago when i first started he goes i'm going to keep repeating and repeating and repeating because some of you will not learn unless you hear it repeated and repeated and repeated you know there is a difference between the word the word is the logos right it's the word that was spoken right but what is the gospel it's the same word but it's in a different manifestation the gospel is that logos now coming into action and your life manifesting what the word says but being lived out that's the gospel that's what we're to preach we're not just to preach the word but preach the manifestation of the word so that the sick can be healed we can lay hands on the sick and the lame will jump up and walk what is it when a little girl comes here bound with a spirit you take her into another room and you've been anointed for the challenge and you walk her back across the stage a free person amen that ain't the word that's the gospel the word declares in my name they shall cast out devils the gospel put that word into action and now that young girl's free from that spirit that's the word i'm preaching to you i'm not trying to dissect and split and say they're too different it's the same one but it has a different manifestation the gospel is the word living in human lives he says now the word may manifest is the gospel the gospel came to us not through word only but through power and demonstration of the holy ghost now the message five definition five definite identifications of a true church of the living god he said the gospel is the power of god to make the word act what it says it will do do you hear me church all right it's the gospel it's the power of god to make the word act what it says it would otherwise it's putting this word off of print and putting it in the flesh and making this flesh obey the word and come subject to it and manifest exactly what's on the printed page he says now this is in the message faith that was once delivered to the saints because when i was in when i was i landed in india the methodist bishop and many of them came out there to meet me and they said brother branham we've heard we've heard of these things we preached a word we know more about theology perhaps and all you americans put together because the bible is an eastern book he goes and that's right he said but we want to see someone anointed with the holy ghost that can make it live again he said that's it we want somebody who can produce what the bible says it will do he says we otherwise we want to see the faith that was once delivered to the saints and i believe that that's what we want here tonight we want somebody who's anointed with the holy ghost to make the word act what it says it will do not just in the young but in the old in the sick in those that are bound somebody that'll grab hold to this word and make it act make it manifest no matter what kind of trial you're in no matter what kind of dark situation you're in make this word manifest i was reading this morning had daniel begin to pray and for 21 days it seemed like god didn't answer his prayer but then the spirit came or the angel came and said i was held up by the prince of persia but daniel on that first moment when you went before god and started praying i heard you and i was coming i want you to know young person i want you to know church he's the same god today your prayer hasn't gone unanswered you hold on because in just a moment's time that prayer is going to manifest through your life i believe that we are a people that's been anointed with the holy ghost to make this word live notice the prophet of god say the gospel will take effect on anything that you preach he goes i've seen a baffle of bull amen i've seen it cause hornets not to sting now i'm not even gonna go there i'm just gonna move on we know what bulls do we know how tough they are and how rambunctious they are and how powerful they are but the gospel preached to a bull make it turn around and go back and lay down you ever been stung by a hornet it ain't fun don't go picking a fight with a hornet you're going to lose every time but when you preach the gospel to the hornet it flies right on wave at you with his little wings seeing the gospel will take an effect he goes i've seen it raise up a possum been laying dead all night he said every creature jesus preached to a tree and some of y'all look like trees tonight you're just standing there or sitting there just kind of stuck and stiff and it's wednesday night i get it it's been a long day for most of us but he preached the gospel to the tree and the tree obeyed the gospel he said so we can preach and he says now in john 14 and verse 19 yet a little while the world sees me no more but you shall see me because i live you shall live also he goes at that day you should know that i am in the father ye and me and i and you and in the message jehovah jireh the prophet of god will tell us my contentions is this is that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the bible says so jesus when he was here on earth he claimed that he was going to turn back to the father again in the form of the spirit but when he come in the form of the holy ghost he would abide with us forever and the very same works that he did he would do through the church until he'd come again what are you going to do how are you going to act what are you going to display is your life going to manifest the gospel he says a little while the world the church world worldly minded not seed church members and so forth will not see me he said did the church members actually see him in that day says no sir they'd never seen him in the light of who he was they seen the corporal body because they had a sense of sight those who could see he said they saw him him in light of his human being but they didn't see him in light of the son of god because they said he was a devil he was a mind reader who's the bells above chief of the fortune tellers but there were some people then who believed him and he said they were called the common people say hey common folks the bible says blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for many prophets and sages have longed to hear this message and to see this manifestation of all those mysteries now being unfolded tied together all the loose ends on display don't you see the seat that you occupy is a special seat for a special class of people not everybody can take your seat it's a special group church as brother tim put it a few services ago it's for a prophetic class of people he may have drug in here all beat down just realize you're a prophetic class of people prophetic class of people see the world can't see him the church systems don't see him what they see is a god or two or a man of 2000 years ago they did some great things but they failed to see him in the form in which he's in today and i'm afraid many message preachers and churches fail to see the form that he's in today let me just kind of go forward here because i know i don't have much time left but i want to get to some highlights here willa brown says now don't you see the authority of the living god living in the church the bride the sick are healed not in a prophet in the bride i'm not trying to take your attention off of a prophet don't please don't think that but i want our thinking to be on we have a ministry we have a purpose we have a calling and that's to make this word manifest the gospel he says now don't you see the authority of the living god in the living church to bride the sick are healed the dead are raised the cripples walk the blind sea the gospel goes forth in its power for the message and the messenger are the same the word is in the church in the person there it is right there there's the church there's the word it's in the person manifesting and the sick are healed and the dead are raised those who were dead and sins and trespasses raised to the newness of life notice now when elijah when elijah said it wasn't going to rain that was god speaking through elijah when joshua stopped the sun and said son you stand still that was god manifesting through joshua and when you have a need and you speak it that's not you and your human need that's god the gospel manifesting through you for that need now here's what i want you to clinch down on can i go i'm going to go a few more minutes i'm not going to say it again because i was told last time joe daddy papa brother joe you closed five times before you finally closed well five is the number of whatever man grace it's one of them it's a number i'm not gonna say it again we're gonna end on three because three is perfection so we find here 1962 the spoken word is the original seed y'all want to hear this quote come on give me a hearty amen all right that's good he says my mission this is the prophet of god my mission i believe to the earth is what is to forerun the coming word see the coming word which is christ and christ in him has the millennium and has everything right there because he is a word but he says my mission i believe to the earth is to what is to forerun the coming word now we find john the baptist four ran the first coming of the word jesus christ in in groom form and yet the prophet of god is forerunning the coming word again but now it's not in groom form it's in bride form so what was the prophet sent for he was consent to forerun your coming so that that same word would manifest in laodicea it would raise the people up above the darkness of laodicea and they will live above sin he's forerunning our coming christ in bright form oh if it's christ in bright form then why are we all in our lousy wows he moves recognize this day this scripture is fulfilled i've been anointed brother joe to preach the gospel to declare it in the school declare it on the job declare when i go to walmart declare to this unregenerated generation i'm declared that the gospel live jesus christ is the same and i'm his representative i'm an ambassador i've been called by the lamb of god to be changed in the moment and the twinkling of a lot and ain't no devil in hell can stop god's purpose for my life what am i telling you church you got something to do you gotta manifest this word heath for ran your coming he's preached the message and what a great message we got we cannot separate the message from the messenger and the prophet of god will tell us you become the word as you receive the word and the more that we receive this message and receive this word the more we become christ's life because christ is the message it's not brother branham's idea but it's christ it's his mind see he says now we didn't come to talk about the message we didn't come to he says we are come to together to get in the message that's the message of christ and he is the word he goes i challenge you to believe that jesus christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body i challenge you to believe notice that jesus christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh but brother joe i got up this morning i didn't feel saved i challenge you to believe that jesus christ is revealed in your human failures he's revealed in you he the perfect word is being revealed in your fallen humanity what a god we serve he looked beyond your inconsistencies he looked beyond your failures he looked beyond your crabbiness and your ups and your downs and he says i'm going to manifest through that vessel i'm going to come i'm going to tabernacle i'm going to dwell not on that i'm going to manifest what my word declares through that life i'm gonna have young people that's gonna break the back of sin i'm gonna have young men who's gonna break the back of sin gonna rise and be some of these young men are to be preachers one day deacons one day but nevertheless they're going to be holy ghost field pillars in the church oh i'm talking about a gospel that's going forth you know peter and john they went to the gate called beautiful and there was a man there lame he'd been lame for many years and no doubt he wanted something give me some money i need to buy food my family's starving this that another and peter looked at me says silver and gold have i none but such as i have today is your lucky day because i'm giving it to you well what do you got i'd be like some of us you got five dollars ten dollars no i ain't got silver and i don't have gold but what i have is i have the healer living on the inside of me and he said he took him by his right hand lifted him up and his ankle bones immediately came together what is it i'm talking about a gospel peter and john not only lived with jesus they not only walked with jesus but they met the same jesus that they walked with in the upper room and they were endued with power and when they came to that old crippled man they didn't have silver they didn't have gold they didn't have a fancy car but they had the holy ghost on the inside and that holy ghost had a power to raise a lame man up and the bible said that he rose to his feet leaping and praising god what about it even like tabernacle you've been laying too long it's time to let me rise up and immediately receive strength to bring forth we serve a living god they knew that they had been with jesus they acted like jesus they preach like jesus they talk like jesus oh my when's the last time you've been mistaken for jesus don't answer that you'll be disappointed see oh my but paul would tell us for our gospel our gospel came not to you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost see we have paul's gospel we're preaching paul's gospel we're living paul's gospel we're manifesting paul's gospel and we find what is that gospel gonna do that gospel is to bring forth life not lectures not pulpit clowns but life life life because this word is life and we find that word the word there means mechanics and he said the gospel came in power dynamics dunamis the power to bring forth miracles so otherwise it's the gospel in action paul's gospel had power dunamis it was a gospel it was an action it produced it healed it delivered it set free he says there's power he says there'll be a power put in the church and now it's coming in that the holy spirit was so anointed to people till they will speak the word and it'll create itself right there he says we haven't seen powers likes coming to the church for i know that for a fact you say unto this mountain be moved and not doubt in your heart but believe what you have said shall come to pass then you shall have whatsoever you had said see the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church then he says the critic's mouths will shut i don't care what you say critic because you don't have what i have because if you had what i had you couldn't criticize what i got and until you get a taste of what i'm drinking you don't need to criticize see what the church needs say is not more words we got the word but we need to put the word in action we need to let our faith loose and let the word do what it says it would do see they don't want no movement of the spirit to drive people to the altar they don't want no new converts weeping their way to calvary those acts 2 38 screaming young as they don't want that anymore we've matured in the message now and all we need is the the word the word the letter killeth but it's the spirit the dunamis the gospel gives life to the word see if we're going to manifest christ then we can't be afraid to go back to pentecost not azusa but the upper room because it was in the upper room where they endued power and when they went to the markets the power went with them when they went to work the power went with them wherever they went they didn't leave the power in the upper room the power went with them it lived in them it sustained them everywhere the believer went the power was there to represent and declare what they said they had i'm asking you tonight church what are you going to do let me end it with this quote here and this is where i was trying to get to he said there's been churches churches brides brides but there has to come one there has to come a real bride see satan doesn't want you to realize that there's going to be one and you are that one so no matter how much mechanics prove to be right there has there's got to be the dynamics to make it work him being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of the revelations see he was the dynamics when he put his foot on the brow of the boat and said peace be still he was the dynamics when he stood at the grave of latter and said lather has come forth and a man who's been dead four days skin worms was in his body and he came walking out he was the dynamics when he cast demons out of legion he was the dynamics when he met a woman at the well and told her that she had five husbands and the one she was living with now is not her husband and maybe told them all their names and what they liked see he was the same dynamics when sister atlanta got down and ran around the church and was delivered a cancer same dynamics jesus christ the same today he was the same dynamics when sister candace and brother andrew received a touch in the womb to bring forth life same dynamics same dynamics from brother david dexter had a serious eye infection but god came down and healed same dynamics that touched drew dexter and a young boy who never had walked all of a sudden the spirit of god moved in the room and he raised up and he's not stopped walking since same dynamics not mechanics but the dynamics the gospel making the word manifest see the same dynamics that restore mariah's hair and it's the same dynamics that's in this church tonight and he tells us matthew 21 and 22 all things whatsoever you ask in prayer believing you shall receive john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me in the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto the father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it so we've been told to ask and i ask you tonight what are you going to do he's the same today and here's the quote that i wanted to get to and i promise you i'm ending on this brother branham was in la crescenta and there was a brother there was a preacher who had a four-month-old baby and this baby had cancer throat cancer and a doctor had performed a surgery on this baby and they split his throat he said he had a cut all the way around his throat trying to get the cancer out and the cancer moved from his throat from his jaws into his tongue and his tongue was swollen he says he says here he says now he goes i went to the hospital with him to see the baby and we walked in the room and he's right there next to the nurse's headquarters for the little baby just four months old he was born with a malignant tumor in the jaws which would swole out approximately that far from his face like that and just like that and the doctors had tried to operate and create big deep scars that cut all around his little throat all the way around it didn't stop he didn't stop it only run into his tongue and the little jaws hanging like that and deep big scars and his little tongue little mouth not over this big and his tongue probably swollen big and swollen and pushed out about like that and turned black and he shut off the breathing from his nostrils and coming down when it swelled up on the roof of his mouth and of course he could it cut his breath off from him they had to cut a hole in his throat and a little whistle they little little whistle-like thing they put in his throat little tin whistle there that's an awful situation ain't it imagine if this was your baby four-month-old malignant tumors cut all in his jaw swollen out tongue swollen out had to give him a tracheotomy because he couldn't breathe he said his little arms were in splints now they had his arms and splints so he wouldn't pull the tracheotomy out of his throat he said he couldn't reach he said so they have his arms and spent like this so that he couldn't reach and pull the whistle out he would choke and the cancer draining a nurse had to stand there with something to pull the drainage of the cancer out of the whistle or it would choke the little child and the father walked around to the bedside he says ricky daddy's little boy and he said daddy brought brother brandon to pray for you rick and he says when he said daddy's little boy my spirit just left me and i thought i couldn't stand any longer i just had to hold to the side of the bed daddy's little boy he goes i just couldn't speak you know i just kind of felt full and i just couldn't say anything and because i looked down i seen the little bitty hands out underneath the big splints and making a wheezing noise and i thought isn't that pitiful and after i kind of got around to myself enough to think i thought jesus do you mean that you get pleasure out of seeing that i can't believe it i just can't believe that you get glory out of the little baby suffering like that it just can't be if it makes me a sinner and feel like that that i do about that baby what ought to do to you as the all-resource of mercy what must it do to you now notice here's a prophet of god he had stood before many of people and pronounced healing but yet now he has seen this little child in this situation and notice he's awestruck he doesn't know what to do he goes and the nurse was standing there and i looked down at the little fella and i thought lord what would you do if you were standing here and now i realize that i'm in the pulpit and i realize that god is present but it seemed to me that something spoke down to my soul and said i'm waiting to see what you're going to do about it your situation your trial your sickness your dilemma god what are you gonna do about my situation i've given you the word i've declared that you are the word you're the bride of christ you're christ in bride form and now you are presented with the authority of the gospel to make that word live and here was god's representative his mouthpiece on earth and he looked down and said lord what are you going to do about it and he said the lord spoke to him dropped down on his own he goes i'm waiting to see what you're going to do about it i gave my authority to the church there you come back again to say to this mountain i gave my authority to the church and i'm waiting to see what you're going to do i wonder he says now i wonder if that's the attitude towards us all the time that he's waiting to see what we're going to do what about the signs of the time that we're just preaching about what would he do he's waiting to see what we're going to do he says now he goes well i got that little baby in my hand i just put his little fingers like this and it was so little and i said lord hear the prayer of your servant and by faith that i believe that you are i placed between this demon of cancer in this baby's life the blood of jesus christ between the killer and the baby the blood and by faith i placed that and i couldn't say nothing else i just turned around and started walking out he didn't have some big lab of prayer he didn't scream to the top of his lungs some of y'all probably wish i wouldn't as well but we all have different ministries but here he just prays a simple what seems to be a simple prayer but i believe he enter into the suffering of that little child father if it makes me a sinner feel the way i feel about this and how this demon has attacked this little child what about you and the spirit of the lord says what are you going to do about it and what did he do he put between that baby and that cancer the blood of jesus christ he says i went on to the house and in a matter of a few hours and another sermon he says two hours them jaws went down its tongue went back to the normal place and god healed that little fellow and they was removing the whistle the next morning and he went home what did he do he preached the gospel he preached the gospel in a prayer in a prayer and many times musicians you can come many times we're waiting on god to move some of you came to the service tonight waiting and expecting god to move to see what god's going to do how is god going to respond and maybe you're waiting till next weekend when we have such great ministry lined up brother wayne and brother donny and brother ron maybe you're waiting because your your nature gravitates to their ministry and you like that and that's fine but i'm asking you what are you going to do tonight you come tonight and maybe you got a nervous spirit seems to keep hanging around refuses to leave and you're waiting for god to do something maybe you came and you've been tormented by fear maybe anxiety maybe it's guilt of your past and you're waiting on god to move to deliver maybe you have health issues and it just just kind of seems to keep lingering and lingering and you've been wanting to be healed and you're expecting god and you're saying well maybe if i come to service tonight it's going to be my service god's going to do something but i want you to know god's here tonight and he's asking what are you going to do what are you going to do he's given you his spirit he's given you the authority to act in his name he's given you his word of promise he said whatsoever you ask in my name i will do it that tells me that he's ready to back up anything you have need of he's ready to bankrupt heaven before one promise of god falls to the ground do you not know that we are the final voice to the final age if we are that final voice and we got to give voice to the promise of god we got to give voice to healing we have to give voice to deliverance we got to give voice to the promises of god to make this gospel manifest what it declares that it will do we got to give voice church we're his hands we're his eyes we're his gospel and the gospel is going to be preached just play whatever you'd like to play i was at brother matt morris several weeks ago and there's a young boy they brought up for prayer this little boy was diagnosed with lupus he's probably eight or nine years old doctors just diagnosed him with lupus and they brought the young man up for prayer and said brother joe we got to go to memphis here in a few weeks and see how what the course of the treatment's going to be how do we go from here how does our life change and altering what we got to do because i guess there's really no cure for lupus you know it's just a disease that stays with them so they brought this little boy up and i'd preach the first part of this message that jesus christ is the same today sir as we are seeing jesus i took that little boy in my arms and i prayed and i said god when he goes for this doctor's visit it is my prayer through the anointing of your spirit that the doctors don't find one single trace of lupus who says that's a bold statement he's done being diagnosed i serve a big god two weeks ago this child's father called me and he called me a couple times i didn't know the number and i'm like man who is this calling me so he sends me a text brother joe this is so and so i just wanted you to know i want to tell you the story i brought my son up for prayer so i called him back and he began to tell me i brought my son up for prayer he's the one that has lupus we just went to memphis and we just came back and i want you to know brother joe that doctors didn't find one trace of lupus [Music] they didn't find one trace of lupus it wasn't brother joe but it's jesus christ the same today and i ask you what could i do i could have sent him back to his seat but i prayed the prayer of faith i believed in a living god and it looked impossible but the god that we serve is a god of impossibility and if that devil tries to put something on you i serve a god that's able to take it off for you tonight he's the same church he's a living god tonight and he's here to see what are you gonna do about this gospel are you gonna make this word live how you gonna make this gospel
