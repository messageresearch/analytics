[51:05] chapter 3 and verse 1 today
[51:08] and i'm going to
[51:12] read um most of this chapter
[51:15] this morning as we look into the
[51:18] scripture at least 15
[51:21] 15 verses of this chapter and
[51:24] uh we want to just look back in
[51:27] the bible and look at it as a prophecy
[51:31] of this end time where we are in this
[51:33] end time
[51:34] amen may god bless you as you stand as
[51:37] we read the word of god
[51:39] exodus chapter 3 verse 1. now moses kept
[51:42] the
[51:42] flock of jethro his father-in-law the
[51:44] priest of midian
[51:46] and he led the flock to the backside of
[51:48] the desert and came to the mountain
[51:50] of god even to horeb and the angel lord
[51:53] appeared unto him
[51:54] in a flame of fire out the midst of a
[51:56] bush and he looked and behold the bush
[51:58] burned with fire and the bush was not
[52:01] consumed
[52:02] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[52:05] see this great sight
[52:07] why the bush is not burnt and when the
[52:11] lord
[52:11] saw that he had turned aside the sea god
[52:14] called
[52:15] unto him out of the midst of the bush
[52:17] and said moses moses
[52:19] and he said here am i and he said draw
[52:23] not
[52:23] nigh hither put off thy shoes from off
[52:26] thy feet
[52:27] for the place whereon thou standest is
[52:29] holy ground
[52:31] moreover he said i am the god of thy
[52:34] father the god of abraham the god of
[52:36] isaac
[52:37] and the god of jacob and moses hid his
[52:40] face
[52:41] for he was afraid to look upon
[52:44] god and the lord said i have surely seen
[52:47] the affliction of my people
[52:50] which are in egypt and have heard their
[52:53] cry
[52:54] by reason of their task masters for i
[52:57] know
[52:58] their sorrows and i am come down to
[53:01] deliver them
[53:02] out of the hand of the egyptians and to
[53:04] bring them up
[53:05] out of that land into a good lamb and a
[53:08] large
[53:09] a large into a lamb flowing with milk
[53:12] and honey
[53:13] unto the place of the canaanites and the
[53:15] hittites
[53:16] and the amorites and the perizzites and
[53:18] the
[53:19] hivites and the jebusites
[53:22] and therefore behold the cry of the
[53:25] children of israel is come
[53:27] unto me for i have seen the oppression
[53:30] wherewith the egyptians oppressed them
[53:33] come now therefore i will send thee unto
[53:35] pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[53:37] forth my people the children of israel
[53:40] out of egypt
[53:41] and moses said unto god who am i that i
[53:44] should go into pharaoh
[53:46] that i should bring forth the children
[53:48] of israel out of egypt
[53:50] and he said certainly i will be with you
[53:53] and
[53:53] this shall be a token unto thee that i
[53:57] have sent thee
[53:58] when thou has brought forth the people
[54:01] of
[54:01] out of egypt ye shall serve god upon
[54:04] this mountain
[54:06] and moses said unto god behold when i
[54:08] come unto the children of israel
[54:10] and say unto them the lord god or the
[54:13] god of your fathers
[54:14] hath sent me unto you and they shall say
[54:17] to me
[54:18] what is his name what shall i say unto
[54:21] them
[54:22] and god said unto moses i am that i
[54:25] am and he said thou shalt say unto the
[54:28] children of israel i
[54:30] am has sent me unto you and god said
[54:33] moreover
[54:33] unto moses thus shalt i say unto the
[54:36] children of israel
[54:38] the god of your fathers the god of
[54:39] abraham the god of isaac the god of
[54:41] jacob
[54:42] has sent me unto you this is my name
[54:45] forever
[54:46] and this is my memorial unto all
[54:48] generations
[54:50] and here we are at the last generations
[54:53] amen god bless you you can be seated
[54:57] amen we trust that you'll just
[55:00] uh enjoy the presence of the lord today
[55:03] as
[55:04] we look into the word of god it's just
[55:06] good to see everybody that has assembled
[55:08] with us
[55:10] and if you're a visitor here here with
[55:12] us today
[55:13] we hope that next time you come you
[55:15] won't feel like a visitor
[55:17] amen but you'll feel very comfortable in
[55:20] the presence of god
[55:21] he is here to transform lives
[55:25] and that's what we have seen him do and
[55:27] that's what he will continue to do
[55:30] and um you know we are we're going to be
[55:33] speaking today
[55:34] on being taught by the angel
[55:38] and we have been speaking on the angel
[55:41] of the lord that has
[55:43] been down through scripture and in
[55:46] in the old testament and even in the new
[55:48] testament
[55:50] and um and of course where we are in
[55:53] this time
[55:54] in this generation as i believe we are
[55:57] to be a people that are led by the angel
[55:59] of the lord
[56:01] amen now what sets us apart is
[56:04] that this message is not
[56:08] heralded by or from some denominational
[56:12] headquarters
[56:12] but it actually descended from heavenly
[56:16] dimensions
[56:18] dimensions beyond as an angel stepped
[56:20] out into light
[56:22] much like he did at the first exodus
[56:25] now this scene that um we see
[56:29] in moses time was with me today
[56:32] among most christians kind of a foreign
[56:36] thought or foreign scene it's something
[56:39] that was
[56:40] of yesterday but not of today
[56:44] it would um it would be though something
[56:46] that would
[56:47] the angel lord would be in his
[56:50] pre-incarnate
[56:52] condition because it was a pre-incarnate
[56:54] christ
[56:55] as the angel of the covenant would come
[56:58] down
[56:58] through time all the way until it became
[57:02] incarnate in
[57:03] jesus christ and then after jesus
[57:06] death burial and resurrection and
[57:09] ascension into glory
[57:11] the apostle paul who had never met the
[57:14] lord
[57:15] physically would meet him on the road to
[57:18] damascus
[57:20] and at this time he had returned back to
[57:22] again
[57:23] the the same light that he was
[57:26] as he would meet the children of israel
[57:28] in a pillar of fire
[57:30] in a in a cloud by day and a fire by
[57:34] night
[57:35] and it would it would be that paul would
[57:38] would ask this great light as it spoke
[57:42] to him
[57:42] and who art thou lord and he would say i
[57:46] am jesus and and so we
[57:49] know then that jesus has returned
[57:52] um in the presence of his pillar of fire
[57:56] in the same way that he was in
[57:59] the the uh in his pre-incarnate
[58:03] condition
[58:04] now the message that we're preaching
[58:06] about today it descended
[58:09] from those same heavenly dimensions
[58:13] and um i i think you know when god does
[58:16] something up on the earth he announces
[58:19] it
[58:19] by the angels and and
[58:23] you would see this when john the baptist
[58:25] would come that there would be the angel
[58:27] of god would appear
[58:28] to zacharias his father and tell him
[58:31] about a child that was coming
[58:34] and then there would be again the angel
[58:36] gabriel coming to mary
[58:38] and telling her of how that
[58:41] god would become incarnate and he would
[58:44] borrow
[58:45] her womb to do it in and it would be by
[58:47] the overshadowing
[58:49] of the holy spirit without her knowing
[58:51] any man
[58:53] and and so this is this is god's pattern
[58:57] and god's way even if it is far into
[59:00] the mind of most christians today this
[59:03] was
[59:04] the early church this was the original
[59:07] pattern
[59:08] this is bible doctrine now
[59:11] again you know if john the baptist was
[59:15] announced by the angel and he was the
[59:18] forerunner
[59:20] of the first coming of christ that we
[59:22] know that if
[59:23] we're looking for his second coming
[59:25] which we are
[59:26] then there should be a forerunner to
[59:29] forerun his second coming
[59:31] and would not we expect then that that
[59:34] forerunner to be
[59:35] announced by an angel
[59:39] now we're going to speak just for a
[59:41] moment as i bring some things into
[59:43] review
[59:44] and maybe some here will be the first
[59:47] time you ever heard about this
[59:50] but 75 years ago on may the 7th 1946
[59:55] there was the angel lord appeared in
[59:57] person
[59:58] to william branham he had been seeing
[1:00:00] visions he had been hearing the angel's
[1:00:02] voice
[1:00:03] since a child he had seen him as
[1:00:06] a whirlwind in the tree that and a voice
[1:00:10] that spoke and said never smoke
[1:00:11] or drink or defile your body in any way
[1:00:15] for
[1:00:15] um i have a work for you to do
[1:00:19] when you're older you see the angel
[1:00:22] cares about what you do
[1:00:26] you see you some say well it's just what
[1:00:28] we believe if we just believe it
[1:00:30] in our heart you know then we we don't
[1:00:32] have to have actions that matches our
[1:00:34] belief
[1:00:35] no the angel cares about what you do
[1:00:39] he don't want you drinking smoking
[1:00:41] defiling your body
[1:00:42] amen he wants you to live a clean
[1:00:45] sanctified
[1:00:47] life that has been a work of the holy
[1:00:50] spirit the angel of god
[1:00:51] in your life amen because the holy
[1:00:54] spirit is that same
[1:00:56] angel of the covenant that appeared to
[1:00:58] moses
[1:00:59] there in a burning bush of fire so the
[1:01:02] angel
[1:01:03] cares about you he cares about
[1:01:06] what you do he cares about us in this
[1:01:09] generation
[1:01:10] in this time he cares that our hearts is
[1:01:14] turned
[1:01:15] back to the faith of the fathers he
[1:01:17] cares that we come back to the original
[1:01:20] doctrines that paul
[1:01:21] taught he cares what we believe
[1:01:24] about scripture any way is not going to
[1:01:27] do
[1:01:28] amen the angel of god is very concerned
[1:01:32] about the people of this generation of
[1:01:35] your time
[1:01:36] he's concerned about you he'll come to
[1:01:39] your seat
[1:01:40] he'll deal with your heart he'll speak
[1:01:43] to you as a prodigal
[1:01:45] amen where he will come right to you and
[1:01:48] warn you
[1:01:48] even in the night or when you're right
[1:01:51] there in the very
[1:01:52] slop of sin and he will stir your heart
[1:01:55] and he will move upon you to come into
[1:01:58] his presence
[1:01:59] to return back to the father to come
[1:02:02] home
[1:02:04] you see you if homer for you is not the
[1:02:08] world
[1:02:08] home for you is not sin hope for you is
[1:02:12] not a devil's child
[1:02:13] home for you is god's kingdom amen he
[1:02:17] chose you before the world began and you
[1:02:20] fell from him because of sin
[1:02:22] but he's here to restore you back to
[1:02:25] where you fell
[1:02:26] from what he had in his mind of you to
[1:02:29] restore you
[1:02:30] back to that original condition where
[1:02:32] god
[1:02:33] saw you in his plan before the world
[1:02:36] began
[1:02:37] i want you to know this morning we are
[1:02:39] not happen to sense people
[1:02:41] we are not accidents that have just
[1:02:44] happened a long life sway
[1:02:46] but we are predestinated and called
[1:02:49] and ordained and set out for a purpose
[1:02:52] for this moment and this time have we
[1:02:55] come
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:03:00] and that means that he is a messenger of
[1:03:03] the
[1:03:04] of the second coming bringing a message
[1:03:06] to turn the hearts of the children
[1:03:08] back to the faith of the fathers god's
[1:03:11] concerned about what you believe
[1:03:14] he wants you on the right track and man
[1:03:18] you say well
[1:03:18] you know brother timmy didn't find me in
[1:03:21] sin he found every person in sin
[1:03:23] i was raised up in a christian home but
[1:03:26] he found me in sin
[1:03:28] he found me as a sinner he found me
[1:03:31] needing redemption
[1:03:32] amen and if you have not received
[1:03:34] redemption no matter how
[1:03:35] good you've been how holy that you've
[1:03:38] acted
[1:03:39] how how close that you've walked the
[1:03:41] dress code
[1:03:42] and done everything was just exactly
[1:03:44] right let me tell you you still need a
[1:03:47] savior
[1:03:47] you still need a redeemer
[1:03:51] some of the worst things we've got
[1:03:53] around the country is a bunch of message
[1:03:55] brats on the pew
[1:03:56] who have never come to know jesus
[1:03:58] [Applause]
[1:04:03] now the angel had appeared
[1:04:07] on the ohio river before perhaps
[1:04:09] hundreds of people
[1:04:11] it was like a star that appeared
[1:04:14] over william branham and said the voice
[1:04:17] said as john the baptist
[1:04:19] forerunned the first coming of christ
[1:04:22] you're sent with a message to forerun
[1:04:24] the second coming of christ
[1:04:26] this would also be witnessed in some of
[1:04:28] the great healing campaigns that
[1:04:31] would take place as as brother branham
[1:04:34] would
[1:04:35] carry a message of divine healing
[1:04:39] to the sick and the afflicted and he
[1:04:41] would become
[1:04:42] known among the pentecostals as a
[1:04:44] prophet of god
[1:04:46] he would be they would write books about
[1:04:49] him that says
[1:04:49] a man sent from god and they would
[1:04:52] testify of him as a prophet
[1:04:55] who visited south africa they were they
[1:04:58] would have to testify
[1:05:00] of the divine gift and what god was
[1:05:02] doing and those very books they would
[1:05:04] testify and they would say
[1:05:06] it was it was more than just that
[1:05:09] that that what happened at the river but
[1:05:12] men
[1:05:13] and women who didn't even know it
[1:05:15] wouldn't know anything about it who had
[1:05:17] never heard of the prophecy would
[1:05:18] rise up in the congregation and began to
[1:05:21] speak in other tongues and
[1:05:23] interpretations would come to those
[1:05:25] tongues and a prophecy would come
[1:05:28] out and say that's john the baptist what
[1:05:30] sentiment
[1:05:31] run the first coming of christ you're
[1:05:33] sent with a message
[1:05:35] to forerun the second coming of christ
[1:05:39] amen now again
[1:05:42] t.l osborn would say the same thing as
[1:05:44] he was
[1:05:45] a man who carried that message down into
[1:05:48] argentina down into africa down
[1:05:51] into many many places in his mission
[1:05:53] work
[1:05:54] but it was there that he saw the the
[1:05:57] very
[1:05:58] thing happening he said it wasn't a
[1:06:00] voice i heard
[1:06:01] it wasn't i knew and knew of others that
[1:06:03] said it but
[1:06:04] something rung up within my heart
[1:06:07] as john the baptist
[1:06:10] was sent to forerun the first coming of
[1:06:12] christ
[1:06:14] you're sent with a message to forerun
[1:06:16] the second coming
[1:06:18] we're here in that time
[1:06:22] we are men and women of the second
[1:06:24] coming
[1:06:26] amen the rapture lays ahead the
[1:06:29] ascension lays ahead
[1:06:31] the chains of the body lays ahead but we
[1:06:34] are still
[1:06:34] men and women of the second coming
[1:06:40] we still preach funerals it says and we
[1:06:42] will use the scripture
[1:06:44] that comforts us that says we which are
[1:06:48] alive and remain shall not hinder those
[1:06:50] that are asleep
[1:06:51] but the trump of god shall sound and
[1:06:54] then the lord shall
[1:06:55] descend with a voice this with a with a
[1:06:58] shout and a voice and a trumpet
[1:07:01] we read those scriptures but i want you
[1:07:03] to know and i want to reaffirm it to you
[1:07:05] today
[1:07:06] that's not just a funeral scripture
[1:07:09] that's not just something when we bury
[1:07:11] somebody
[1:07:12] i want you to know that's a prophecy
[1:07:15] that is of this
[1:07:16] last day amen that somebody's going to
[1:07:19] fulfill
[1:07:21] and it ought to be men and women today
[1:07:24] in a hunger than their heart

[1:07:34] that resurrection life hallelujah
[1:07:37] amen amen now

[1:08:17] the lungs
[1:08:18] uh cancer in the bones i don't know how
[1:08:21] many strikes he gets the devil gets to
[1:08:23] hit at somebody
[1:08:25] amen by the way laying there i said and
[1:08:27] i told him the other day
[1:08:29] i said you know we're going to have to
[1:08:30] name you lazarus
[1:08:33] because he doesn't come up from that
[1:08:35] condition so many times why
[1:08:37] because jesus christ is still the same
[1:08:40] yesterday today and forever
[1:08:45] and the other day when cloven thought he
[1:08:47] would take him down
[1:08:48] kobe didn't have enough to take a 70
[1:08:52] year old man
[1:08:53] down come on the devil ain't got enough
[1:08:57] because why the resurrection power of
[1:09:00] jesus christ is still
[1:09:02] in the church he's the resurrection
[1:09:05] in the life oh
[1:09:09] you know brother branham coming up it
[1:09:12] was in a time where
[1:09:13] nobody believed in divine healing nobody
[1:09:16] believed in visions
[1:09:18] nobody believed i mean days of miracles
[1:09:20] were passed
[1:09:22] and being told that these visas and
[1:09:24] voices were
[1:09:25] of the devil because god no longer did
[1:09:28] those things
[1:09:29] the age of it was passed he finally went
[1:09:32] into
[1:09:33] a a a place behind an old cabin
[1:09:38] and you know he he began to
[1:09:42] pray about it asking god to take away
[1:09:45] these visions and and and because the
[1:09:48] theologians and the fellow ministers
[1:09:51] were saying it was all the devil to hear
[1:09:54] the voice of god's peak and so he went
[1:09:57] to
[1:09:57] ask god to take it away and somewhere
[1:09:59] about midnight
[1:10:01] a light came into the room and in that
[1:10:03] light
[1:10:04] he could see a man's feet
[1:10:07] and it materialized the
[1:10:10] rest of the body and out of that light
[1:10:13] stepped
[1:10:13] a man he was about
[1:10:16] six foot tall about 200 pounds
[1:10:20] solid complexion dark eyes a smooth face
[1:10:24] with no beard but hair writing down
[1:10:26] about down to his shoulders
[1:10:28] and he said fear not and when he did he
[1:10:31] recognized it was the same voice
[1:10:34] that he had heard since he was a boy
[1:10:37] and he said i am sent from the presence
[1:10:39] of god
[1:10:40] now notice it was the presence of god he
[1:10:43] said
[1:10:44] didn't feel the same it was like when
[1:10:46] the holy spirit comes around and makes
[1:10:48] you feel happy but
[1:10:49] it was different it was a sacred august
[1:10:52] feeling amen but it was the presence of
[1:10:57] the lord he was like a man
[1:11:00] and he had walked out of this fire this
[1:11:02] whipping
[1:11:03] milling light and yet he was like a man
[1:11:07] yet he was a supernatural being
[1:11:10] that walks right out of that light that
[1:11:11] it entered the room
[1:11:13] and that light was like a whirling
[1:11:15] pulsating fire
[1:11:18] it milled about churning uh hanging in
[1:11:21] the air
[1:11:22] pulsating with the energy glow growing
[1:11:25] bigger and brighter
[1:11:27] and then as the light spread out on the
[1:11:29] floor getting larger and larger
[1:11:31] spreading on the floor
[1:11:32] he could hear footsteps and squinting
[1:11:35] into the light
[1:11:36] he could see a barefoot and then a robe
[1:11:38] and out of there walked a man
[1:11:44] now the amber light continued
[1:11:47] hanging over his head still whirling
[1:11:50] pulsating with energy and this
[1:11:53] this this supernatural being would look
[1:11:56] at him with
[1:11:57] kind expression was a face that brother
[1:12:00] branham would
[1:12:01] never forget although he could never
[1:12:03] find words to
[1:12:05] describe it fully see it was so gentle
[1:12:08] and peaceful and
[1:12:09] yet with a sense of power and authority
[1:12:11] he said no it wasn't jesus
[1:12:13] but he said it was an angel from his
[1:12:15] presence
[1:12:17] and and as he as he spoke he said i
[1:12:21] am sent from the presence of almighty
[1:12:24] god
[1:12:25] to tell you that your peculiar birth and
[1:12:27] misunderstood life
[1:12:29] has been to indicate you're to take a
[1:12:31] gift of divine healing to the people of
[1:12:34] the world
[1:12:34] and if you'll be sincere when you pray
[1:12:37] and get the people to believe you
[1:12:40] remember that
[1:12:41] the report must be believed
[1:12:44] somebody's going to believe it then he
[1:12:46] said nothing will stand before your
[1:12:48] prayers
[1:12:49] amen not even cancer oh my
[1:12:53] amen you you'll go into many parts of
[1:12:56] the world
[1:12:57] and pray for kings and rulers and
[1:12:59] potentiate you preach the multitudes the
[1:13:01] world over
[1:13:02] and thousands will come to you for
[1:13:04] counsel you must tell them that their
[1:13:06] thoughts
[1:13:07] that they speak louder in heaven than
[1:13:10] their words do on the earth
[1:13:13] amen this is a god who who said the word
[1:13:17] discerns the thoughts and the intents
[1:13:21] of the heart now we're reading from the
[1:13:24] account of exodus
[1:13:26] is where we read from this morning and
[1:13:28] that's the second book of
[1:13:31] and moses in the presence of this pillar
[1:13:34] of fire
[1:13:35] and the theophanic angel of the covenant
[1:13:38] he would receive a commission
[1:13:40] with signs of deliverance
[1:13:43] he would be given two signs right
[1:13:46] one he would thrust his hand into his
[1:13:48] bosom it would come out white with
[1:13:50] leprosy throw it back in
[1:13:52] and it would come out it would come out
[1:13:54] clean
[1:13:56] this is a very type of salvation leprosy
[1:14:00] is a type of sin let me go down this
[1:14:03] line just for a moment
[1:14:05] you see leprosy would make a person
[1:14:08] unclean or that they couldn't even live
[1:14:12] in their home where they couldn't even
[1:14:13] live in their town
[1:14:15] they would have to live on the outside
[1:14:18] and
[1:14:18] everywhere that they would go they would
[1:14:20] have to keep their mouth covered
[1:14:21] and they would have to scream out i'm
[1:14:24] unclean
[1:14:25] i'm unclean i'm unclean i'm a leper i'm
[1:14:28] unclean
[1:14:28] you know what that's what sin does to
[1:14:30] you
[1:14:33] amen it'll speak right out of the life
[1:14:37] amen you don't even have to tell nobody
[1:14:40] you don't even have to say you know i'm
[1:14:42] unclean your life will tell it
[1:14:44] the spirit about you will tell it hey
[1:14:48] man he'll scream out
[1:14:49] i'm unclean i'm unclean i'm unclean i'm
[1:14:52] unclean
[1:14:55] but you know there was a when leprosy
[1:14:58] was
[1:14:58] cured there was a sacrifice given for
[1:15:01] that
[1:15:02] and that was they took two turtle doves
[1:15:05] and they took the one and they would
[1:15:08] take the head off of it
[1:15:10] and they would sprinkle its blood on the
[1:15:13] living
[1:15:13] mate and then they would set that
[1:15:17] living mate free
[1:15:21] come on and he would go for it
[1:15:24] sprinkling the blood
[1:15:26] of the dead meat and of course it was
[1:15:29] it was safe clean and clean and
[1:15:32] spreading cleansing
[1:15:34] everywhere went come on that's exactly
[1:15:36] what jesus
[1:15:37] did his life the dove
[1:15:41] was poured out upon us the unclean
[1:15:44] sinner a man poured out upon you have
[1:15:48] set you free
[1:15:50] you're no longer in prison you're no
[1:15:53] longer bound
[1:15:54] you're no longer a sinner you are a
[1:15:57] child of the most high
[1:15:58] god and your life is unclean
[1:16:02] and clean before the life of
[1:16:05] my mate has made me clean
[1:16:15] the other of course it would be a sign
[1:16:19] it would be a sign of his rob turn into
[1:16:22] a serpent a cobra
[1:16:25] which would be which would be the
[1:16:28] replica very symbol of the pharaoh of
[1:16:32] egypt
[1:16:33] the highest power in the land and moses
[1:16:37] was shown by that
[1:16:38] i have the power to loose you or the
[1:16:41] power to bind you
[1:16:44] and anything that comes and opposes me
[1:16:46] like your snakes
[1:16:48] will be swallowed up
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:53] now so we're reading from this account
[1:16:56] of exodus
[1:16:58] moses in the presence of this pillar of
[1:17:01] fire
[1:17:02] and this theophanic angel of the
[1:17:05] covenant
[1:17:07] he would receive a commission and with
[1:17:10] signs of deliverance and
[1:17:12] later he would come to mount sinai as
[1:17:15] he's told about here
[1:17:16] you will bring them again into this
[1:17:18] mountain
[1:17:19] is remarkable to realize but it would be
[1:17:22] actually 50 days um
[1:17:25] or seven weeks after the
[1:17:29] the slaying of the lamb and the passover
[1:17:31] and the coming out of egypt
[1:17:33] and they would go and for after 50 days
[1:17:36] it would come to mount
[1:17:37] sinai it would be on mount sinai that
[1:17:40] the law was given
[1:17:42] the jews would say of that event it was
[1:17:45] when god
[1:17:46] married israel and took her for a bride
[1:17:51] because he was making a covenant with
[1:17:54] her
[1:17:55] is that right amen how many knows we got
[1:17:58] a covenant
[1:18:00] this is our covenant
[1:18:03] amen come on you get married and you
[1:18:06] make your vows
[1:18:09] you say i will i will i will be true i
[1:18:13] will be
[1:18:13] honest i will i will obey you know all
[1:18:16] the vows that are being made
[1:18:19] and when you take god's covenant to be
[1:18:22] his bride
[1:18:23] you vow amen you vow
[1:18:26] to keep this word you vow to esteem
[1:18:31] that day holy and your life to be holy
[1:18:36] and when you vow to take on his great
[1:18:39] name
[1:18:41] and to spread to represent that name
[1:18:43] because now
[1:18:44] everything that you do in word or deed
[1:18:47] you are doing
[1:18:48] representing the name of jesus christ
[1:18:51] your bridegroom so whatever he says
[1:18:56] in the holy scriptures you believe it
[1:19:00] you accept it and you act upon it
[1:19:06] to do otherwise breaks your marriage vow
[1:19:12] you're married now
[1:19:16] there as i said 50 days
[1:19:20] later upon mount sinai moses
[1:19:24] would would actually go into the
[1:19:26] presence of god
[1:19:29] and in the presence of the angels of god
[1:19:32] as as it would be revealed to him
[1:19:36] by the hand of the angel he would
[1:19:38] actually write to five
[1:19:40] first books of the old testament
[1:19:44] wherever we got you know genesis account
[1:19:48] you know maybe moses had heard from the
[1:19:50] egyptians
[1:19:51] how the beginning was and the creation
[1:19:54] and
[1:19:55] how it taken place perhaps you'd heard
[1:19:57] from from
[1:19:58] his his mother the short time he was
[1:20:00] there
[1:20:01] in her home how the creation was and
[1:20:04] how it all began but he would have to
[1:20:06] forget all of his knowledge
[1:20:09] and he would come into the presence of
[1:20:10] that angel and he would write out
[1:20:14] the first five books of your bible was
[1:20:17] given
[1:20:18] by the angel of god to a prophet
[1:20:23] now moses would write
[1:20:27] in the beginning god created
[1:20:30] the heavens and the earth
[1:20:33] now again we come to
[1:20:37] the last chapter or the last book rather
[1:20:40] of the bible
[1:20:42] and the last book of the bible is the
[1:20:44] book of revelation
[1:20:46] and the book of revelation john would
[1:20:49] actually hear
[1:20:50] again um as the bible said he
[1:20:53] sent it and signified it or or
[1:20:57] brought it by the a by his angel
[1:21:00] so again the last book of the bible is
[1:21:03] written and given by the angel to john
[1:21:08] it is the testimony or the revelation of
[1:21:11] jesus christ
[1:21:13] are you with me now amen and john would
[1:21:16] hear the voice of god
[1:21:17] and it said in revelation 1 11 saying
[1:21:21] i am alpha and omega
[1:21:24] the first and the last
[1:21:28] now notice he was the first he was the
[1:21:31] first
[1:21:32] expression of god he was the first
[1:21:35] of god that could be seen it was this
[1:21:38] theophanic messenger that
[1:21:40] was the word the logos of god the pillar
[1:21:44] of fire that was the first thing
[1:21:46] that would go forth from god think of
[1:21:49] this
[1:21:50] then he says in revelation 3 14 to the
[1:21:53] angel of the church he says
[1:21:55] these things saith thee amen
[1:21:59] the faithful and true witness the
[1:22:01] beginning of the creation of god so
[1:22:03] again
[1:22:04] he has searched to the last age i'm not
[1:22:06] only
[1:22:07] the beginning but i'm the end
[1:22:11] i'm not only the first of the book it is
[1:22:14] it is the last of the book from genesis
[1:22:17] to revelation
[1:22:18] i am alpha and omega
[1:22:22] and what did you see in the old
[1:22:23] testament is still
[1:22:25] the same god working in the new
[1:22:27] testament
[1:22:28] not a different god the same god
[1:22:31] now he is the beginning of the new
[1:22:35] creation now notice this he's the
[1:22:39] beginning of the creation of god notice
[1:22:42] said now so notice this the beginning of
[1:22:45] the creation
[1:22:46] so how could god be
[1:22:49] created if he was a spirit
[1:22:52] see how could he be he's eternal he
[1:22:54] never was created
[1:22:56] he will never be created because he's
[1:22:59] god at the beginning
[1:23:01] he always was god amen
[1:23:04] any but here's the beginning of the
[1:23:06] creation of god and
[1:23:08] that was jesus christ when he was made
[1:23:11] manifest in the flesh when god
[1:23:14] lived in him he is god's creation the
[1:23:18] first
[1:23:19] and the last amen so again
[1:23:22] when god created himself a body
[1:23:27] he come down and lived in it that was
[1:23:30] beginning
[1:23:31] of the creation of god this is where
[1:23:34] god created himself a body
[1:23:38] in the beginning he created the heavens
[1:23:40] and earth
[1:23:41] but the beginning of the new creation he
[1:23:43] created himself a body
[1:23:46] to come and live in it
[1:23:50] now revelation 1 8 i am
[1:23:53] alpha and omega i'm the beginning
[1:23:57] and the ending saith the lord which was
[1:24:00] or which is which was and which is to
[1:24:03] come
[1:24:04] the almighty so i want you to get it he
[1:24:06] is he is
[1:24:07] he is the same yesterday that's which
[1:24:10] was
[1:24:11] which is today and which is to come
[1:24:14] forever he's hebrews 13
[1:24:18] 8 right amen the same yesterday today
[1:24:22] and forever
[1:24:24] the almighty
[1:24:28] not a junior god the very god
[1:24:33] amen notice here the almighty to the
[1:24:35] church of evidences
[1:24:37] he says this three times on the almighty
[1:24:39] he comes right over to laodicea and he
[1:24:41] says
[1:24:42] i am the amen i was the first back here
[1:24:45] i'm the last over here
[1:24:47] at the beginning of the creation of god
[1:24:49] through the church ages
[1:24:50] that we were we're to have you you'll
[1:24:52] learn i
[1:24:54] am god god created in a man-form
[1:24:58] i'm the beginning of the creation of god
[1:25:00] we're speaking about jesus now
[1:25:02] amen oh that ought to make anybody shout
[1:25:07] amen to think about it the beginning of
[1:25:10] the creation of god
[1:25:12] and when god was created when
[1:25:15] god was made flesh in jesus christ
[1:25:20] can you imagine god now becomes a part
[1:25:22] of his
[1:25:23] own creation
[1:25:26] now multitudes of people get the idea
[1:25:29] when jesus
[1:25:30] that jesus was the first creation of god
[1:25:33] that makes him lower than godhead
[1:25:36] that would then that first creation
[1:25:38] would create all the rest of the
[1:25:39] universe
[1:25:40] whatever it contained but that's not
[1:25:42] right that don't match with the rest of
[1:25:44] the bible
[1:25:45] because how could god be created when he
[1:25:48] himself
[1:25:49] is the creator is that right
[1:25:52] the eternal logos god was
[1:25:56] manifest in the sun and in jesus dwelt
[1:25:59] the fullness of the godhead
[1:26:01] bodily and that eternal one was the
[1:26:04] father
[1:26:04] manifest in the flesh and thereby
[1:26:09] gained the title of son
[1:26:12] this is how he became the son
[1:26:15] is the father created himself a body
[1:26:18] to come and live in it and because
[1:26:21] it came out from him it is called the
[1:26:23] son of god
[1:26:26] now notice and
[1:26:29] in him the bible said but dwell the
[1:26:32] fullness
[1:26:33] of the godhead bodily that's why
[1:26:37] in the new testament genesis account of
[1:26:40] how the world was created
[1:26:42] john 1 1 says in the beginning was
[1:26:46] the word now this word here
[1:26:49] word means logos in the beginning was
[1:26:53] the
[1:26:53] logos that is the pillar of fire that's
[1:26:57] the theophany christ
[1:26:58] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:27:01] word was
[1:27:02] with god where was he with god he was
[1:27:05] there
[1:27:06] as the lamb slain before the foundation
[1:27:09] of the world
[1:27:10] come on so this was in god's mind
[1:27:14] that man was the word and the word would
[1:27:18] be expressed the thoughts of god would
[1:27:20] be expressed and become the
[1:27:22] word of god and this projection of god
[1:27:26] was god
[1:27:30] now so again the same was in the
[1:27:33] beginning with god
[1:27:34] all things were made by the word
[1:27:37] and without the word was not anything
[1:27:39] made that was made
[1:27:42] john 1 14 and the word the low gospels
[1:27:44] made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:27:47] the logos become flesh in jesus christ
[1:27:51] and we beheld his glory as the only
[1:27:54] begotten of the father
[1:27:55] full of grace and truth i'm trying to
[1:27:58] show you
[1:27:59] who this theophany christ is
[1:28:02] i'm trying to show you who this angel of
[1:28:04] the covenant is
[1:28:06] you see the beginning of it all was when
[1:28:08] god
[1:28:09] released himself from his thoughts
[1:28:12] to become the word and that expression
[1:28:15] of his thoughts was the word and now the
[1:28:17] word
[1:28:18] became the form of god
[1:28:23] amen it was it was represented as a
[1:28:26] sacred light because god is
[1:28:30] light is that right
[1:28:33] it was a pillar of fire that started
[1:28:36] moving
[1:28:37] as it moved toward manifestation in a
[1:28:40] theophanic
[1:28:41] form now first of all
[1:28:45] in the beginning god dwelt alone with
[1:28:47] his attributes
[1:28:49] that's his thoughts there was nothing
[1:28:50] just god alone in his thoughts
[1:28:53] how many you know god's eternal so i
[1:28:55] mean you can't count years
[1:28:57] of how long that existed like that is
[1:29:00] that right
[1:29:01] amen you know and he was just as if a
[1:29:04] great architect
[1:29:05] would sit down and begin to make a plan
[1:29:09] you begin to draw out uh you know
[1:29:12] something
[1:29:13] you know exactly when i when we started
[1:29:15] building this
[1:29:16] building i had a thought in mind
[1:29:20] i had a thought in mind and you know of
[1:29:22] what i wanted and about the size i
[1:29:25] wanted and
[1:29:25] what kind of rooms were out and the
[1:29:27] style of building all of these things we
[1:29:29] had something in mind
[1:29:31] we projected it to a skilled architect
[1:29:36] and he would write it out he said you
[1:29:38] want it like this
[1:29:39] i said yes but more like this and you
[1:29:42] want it like this but yes
[1:29:44] i want this included here and there and
[1:29:47] finally
[1:29:48] what was in my mind became on paper
[1:29:53] you see but it had to be spoken at an
[1:29:56] architect
[1:29:57] or shall i say a prophet
[1:30:01] would write it down and said here's what
[1:30:04] come from
[1:30:04] god's thoughts the word that was spoke
[1:30:06] to me and now
[1:30:08] i've got it manifested on the paper
[1:30:13] amen now then finally what was
[1:30:17] what was in my thoughts became on paper
[1:30:21] and it went from paper into
[1:30:23] manifestation
[1:30:25] so god in his beginning he had a plan
[1:30:28] and he had a family in mind
[1:30:32] amen he speak it out through the
[1:30:34] prophets he would
[1:30:35] write it out in the blueprint
[1:30:39] come on church oh man he would write it
[1:30:42] out on the blueprint and then once he
[1:30:43] wrote it out on the blueprint
[1:30:45] it's got to come in the manifestation in
[1:30:47] flesh
[1:30:48] god will have a bride of people without
[1:30:51] spock
[1:30:51] or blemish
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:56] now in the beginning god dwelt alone
[1:31:00] now he was dwelt along with his thinking
[1:31:05] and that thought when is expressed is a
[1:31:08] word
[1:31:09] it's a thought expressed as a word
[1:31:12] but it has to be a thought first so it's
[1:31:16] god's attributes that then it becomes a
[1:31:18] thought
[1:31:19] then a word now notice first of all
[1:31:22] god is invisible
[1:31:27] go with me to first timothy 1 17 now
[1:31:29] unto the king eternal
[1:31:31] immortal invisible
[1:31:34] the only wise god
[1:31:38] be glory forever and ever so he is
[1:31:40] eternal
[1:31:42] he's the king eternal immortal
[1:31:45] invisible and the only wise god
[1:31:49] there's no other god beside him hebrews
[1:31:53] 11
[1:31:53] 27 by faith moses forsook egypt not
[1:31:58] fearing the wrath of the king for he
[1:31:59] endured as seen
[1:32:02] or rather taken heed to him
[1:32:05] who is invisible
[1:32:11] and then in colossians 1 14 we see
[1:32:15] in jesus whom we have redemption
[1:32:18] through his blood even the forgiveness
[1:32:21] of sins
[1:32:23] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:32:28] the firstborn of every creature for by
[1:32:32] him were all things created that
[1:32:34] are in heaven and that are in the earth
[1:32:36] of visible and invisible
[1:32:38] uh whether that be thrones or dominions
[1:32:41] or principalities or powers or
[1:32:43] all things were created by him and for
[1:32:45] him and he is before
[1:32:46] all things and by him all things consist
[1:32:51] so we see that jesus now is
[1:32:54] the image of the invisible
[1:32:58] god he was made to portray
[1:33:02] god in his fullness
[1:33:05] now john 1 18 says no man
[1:33:08] has seen god at any time
[1:33:11] the only begotten son which is in the
[1:33:14] bosom or the heart
[1:33:15] which is the father's heart and when he
[1:33:18] have
[1:33:19] declared him so again
[1:33:22] no man has seen god at any time but the
[1:33:25] only begotten of the son
[1:33:26] has made him visible
[1:33:30] the invisible god was made visible
[1:33:33] in jesus that's why when philip saw
[1:33:38] said show us the father turn with me to
[1:33:40] john 4 23
[1:33:41] and we'll we'll get it here um and hear
[1:33:45] that our father is a spirit and i want
[1:33:47] to start right there with that
[1:33:48] and then we'll talk about philip but he
[1:33:50] said in john 4
[1:33:52] 23 but this but the hour cometh
[1:33:55] and now is when the true worshipers
[1:33:58] shall worship the
[1:34:00] father in spirit and in truth for the
[1:34:02] father
[1:34:03] seek as such to worship him god is a
[1:34:06] spirit and they that worship him must
[1:34:09] worship him in spirit and in truth so
[1:34:12] god is a spirit he is
[1:34:14] an invisible spirit jesus would say
[1:34:18] it was like the wind he said you know
[1:34:21] you
[1:34:22] it blows where the list is but no one
[1:34:24] knows where it come from
[1:34:26] they don't know where it went all you
[1:34:28] can see is the effects of it
[1:34:30] now so in john 14 8 when philip
[1:34:34] said because he said that he was the
[1:34:36] image of the invisible god
[1:34:39] that in john 4 23 but the hour cometh
[1:34:42] oh excuse me john 14 8 philip said to
[1:34:45] him
[1:34:45] lord show us the father and it'll
[1:34:48] satisfy us
[1:34:48] because he said i'm going to the father
[1:34:51] i'm going back to fatherhood again
[1:34:54] i'm leaving here walking the shores of
[1:34:56] galilee
[1:34:58] but i'm going back to the form i was
[1:35:00] before i came here
[1:35:04] and jesus said unto him have i been so
[1:35:08] long with you and yet thou has not known
[1:35:10] me philip
[1:35:11] he that seen me has seen the father and
[1:35:14] how sayest thou then
[1:35:15] show us the father believeth thou not
[1:35:18] that i am in the father
[1:35:19] and the father in me and the words that
[1:35:21] i speak unto you
[1:35:23] are not of my i speak not of myself but
[1:35:25] the father
[1:35:26] that dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[1:35:29] believe that i am in the father and the
[1:35:31] father in me or else believe me for the
[1:35:33] very work's sake
[1:35:35] if you can't believe me for what i'm
[1:35:36] saying just look and see the signs
[1:35:40] amen now the same thing that he's saying
[1:35:43] but how do you say philip
[1:35:44] show us the father when you see me
[1:35:49] you've seen the father because
[1:35:52] why he had the son had
[1:35:56] declared the invisible god
[1:35:59] amen he put on god the invisible and put
[1:36:02] on a body
[1:36:04] that would declare god
[1:36:07] amen that we can see exactly what his
[1:36:09] attitude was toward the sick
[1:36:11] toward the loss
[1:36:14] come on church amen all you got to do is
[1:36:17] look at the image
[1:36:18] of the invisible god the likeness that
[1:36:21] is jesus christ the full expression of
[1:36:24] god you'll know what he thinks about the
[1:36:26] sick
[1:36:28] you'll know what he thinks about the
[1:36:30] lust
[1:36:31] amen you you'll be like that woman who
[1:36:34] was caught
[1:36:34] right in the midst of her sin and he
[1:36:37] would say neither
[1:36:38] do i condemn thee go thou in sin no more
[1:36:42] thy sins be forgiven
[1:36:47] this is the kind of god we serve now
[1:36:50] what god did now listen closely
[1:36:53] wake up your neighbor so that he hears
[1:36:55] what i'm talking about
[1:36:57] amen what god did was he fathered
[1:37:00] himself a body to live in
[1:37:04] and in that form he was the son
[1:37:08] because the body was fathered by
[1:37:11] creation
[1:37:12] in the womb of mary that's right amen
[1:37:16] now god came down in a blood cell
[1:37:20] think of this mary knew no man
[1:37:25] it was the overshadowing of the holy
[1:37:27] spirit
[1:37:29] there was a creation that took place on
[1:37:31] the inside of her
[1:37:33] god placed the egg and the sperm some
[1:37:35] someone would say well
[1:37:37] he's a jew he's not a jew someone would
[1:37:40] say well he's a gentile
[1:37:41] for all of us no he's not a gentile
[1:37:44] somebody say well he's
[1:37:45] he's black he's not a black you want to
[1:37:48] say he's white he's not a wife
[1:37:52] he's the creation of god
[1:37:57] amen now he didn't come down to join
[1:38:00] your race he came down to start a new
[1:38:02] race
[1:38:03] so that you could be of a new blood
[1:38:06] and a new bloodline by the spirit
[1:38:09] are you with me now the god came down in
[1:38:12] a blood cell
[1:38:13] not through a man but by the holy ghost
[1:38:16] into that virgin
[1:38:17] womb of mary you see
[1:38:21] a tabernacle was built for the purpose
[1:38:24] of death now he would taste death
[1:38:28] god couldn't do that god can't die
[1:38:31] so he would make and design a body
[1:38:34] that he would come and dwell in so that
[1:38:38] that body could be offered as
[1:38:40] the lamb sacrifice now watch
[1:38:44] now to see the woman came in ordered
[1:38:47] that
[1:38:48] he would be bruised to bring our
[1:38:50] salvation this is an ancient prophecy
[1:38:54] all the way back when when
[1:38:57] when mary not mary went even and adam
[1:39:00] was walking out of the garden
[1:39:03] and here they were in that where sin had
[1:39:06] come in
[1:39:06] death was now upon them changes were
[1:39:09] taking place
[1:39:10] they were moving from immortality into
[1:39:13] mortal
[1:39:14] condition they were dying he said the
[1:39:17] day you eat there of that day you die
[1:39:19] and they begin to die
[1:39:20] from that very moment and here they're
[1:39:23] walking out of the garden
[1:39:26] remember even to have that conference
[1:39:28] with god
[1:39:29] god would slay a lamb
[1:39:32] and he would take those garments and put
[1:39:34] them on adam and put them on eve
[1:39:38] and here they are going down along the
[1:39:41] trail and
[1:39:42] that bloody garment is slapping down
[1:39:44] along them
[1:39:46] they've been dripping with blood because
[1:39:50] god is seeing there's going to come a
[1:39:52] time
[1:39:53] that there will be the lamb of god who
[1:39:55] will slay
[1:39:56] who will be slain for the sins of the
[1:39:59] world
[1:40:00] and i'll take him and i'll take away
[1:40:03] your sins
[1:40:04] and give you his righteousness and i
[1:40:06] won't be able to see your sins anymore
[1:40:08] because all i can see is the
[1:40:10] righteousness of jesus christ
[1:40:13] [Applause]
[1:40:15] now then he is a walking out amen
[1:40:19] god saying you have sinned you've done
[1:40:22] wrong
[1:40:23] get out of my presence you're
[1:40:26] walking out of the gate of the garden of
[1:40:28] eden out of paradise
[1:40:31] they may never never to ever be able to
[1:40:33] come back again
[1:40:34] and as they do when the heart of god
[1:40:37] moves toward his children
[1:40:40] so but you know you're going but you're
[1:40:42] not going along
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:45] i'm going with you because i'm going to
[1:40:47] be a seed
[1:40:49] and as a seed i'm going to give it to a
[1:40:51] woman
[1:40:52] and in that woman's seed i'm going to
[1:40:54] bruise the head
[1:40:56] of this serpent and i'm going to correct
[1:40:58] what she
[1:40:59] did to mankind
[1:41:05] so the ancient prophecy said thy seed
[1:41:10] shall thy seed shall bruise his head
[1:41:14] and the serpent seed would bruise his
[1:41:17] heel
[1:41:18] where he touched the earth
[1:41:22] where he walked upon the earth it would
[1:41:24] be when he
[1:41:25] walked upon the earth when he become
[1:41:27] flesh
[1:41:29] there jet would bite him
[1:41:33] but in doing so he would crush
[1:41:37] the head
[1:41:40] of the ancient serpent i want you to
[1:41:44] know because of calvary
[1:41:46] amen the old serpent that called you to
[1:41:49] sin
[1:41:50] to be born in sin shape and iniquity
[1:41:52] come to the world speaking life
[1:41:54] god crossed your head at calvary
[1:42:01] hallelujah and even though the death
[1:42:04] right now
[1:42:05] works in your mortal body it true will
[1:42:08] be
[1:42:08] championed over but you will not lay in
[1:42:11] them pray forever
[1:42:13] but you will rise again and if you're
[1:42:15] alive and remain at the coming of the
[1:42:17] lord
[1:42:17] you will be changed in a moment in a
[1:42:26] twinkling
[1:42:28] the holy ghost came upon mary
[1:42:31] he gave her a seed
[1:42:36] the woman has no seed god gave her a
[1:42:40] seed
[1:42:42] and and he created within that womb
[1:42:45] the cell that would multiply and become
[1:42:48] the body
[1:42:50] of our lord amen
[1:42:53] now let me just take a moment i've been
[1:42:56] a farmer most of my life
[1:42:59] i was i've been an animal lover
[1:43:03] all of my life when i was a young boy
[1:43:08] it was dogs that were my passion when i
[1:43:10] come into teenagers
[1:43:12] it was purebred goats that were my
[1:43:14] passion
[1:43:16] i have today registered angus
[1:43:19] they're not so much my passion i'm
[1:43:21] getting too old for it all
[1:43:22] and i'm about to let everything go but
[1:43:26] let me just talk about it for a moment
[1:43:30] you see we have science has developed
[1:43:35] in this time where used to be
[1:43:38] that all we could have was we had to own
[1:43:41] the male and then the female
[1:43:44] and there had to be a physical breeding
[1:43:47] science learned that they could take the
[1:43:50] seed of the male
[1:43:51] and they could freeze it way down into
[1:43:55] way down below i think it's like not
[1:43:58] under 200 degrees below freezing in the
[1:44:01] nitrogen
[1:44:03] and it would and that life would live
[1:44:05] there
[1:44:06] for for a long time there in fact
[1:44:09] i had reproductions from
[1:44:12] animals that were where that sperm had
[1:44:16] been put up for 30 plus years and i
[1:44:18] could go back
[1:44:19] in a pedigree and i could bring that
[1:44:22] animal forward
[1:44:24] and i would cause him then to be this
[1:44:26] great great grandson and i bring his
[1:44:28] genes
[1:44:29] forward into my breeding program
[1:44:32] and you know because we we bred champion
[1:44:35] goats and was known
[1:44:37] all over the united states for that
[1:44:39] national competitions and so on
[1:44:42] but now you know then they learned that
[1:44:45] you know but it was kind of a poor thing
[1:44:47] that one
[1:44:48] one female could only produce so many
[1:44:52] offsprings
[1:44:53] so many times you would not just want
[1:44:56] the
[1:44:57] the male you would want the females
[1:45:00] offspring also to come so they learned
[1:45:04] with embryo transplants
[1:45:06] where they would take and super ovulate
[1:45:10] the the woman they would taken
[1:45:13] or shall i say the animal the female
[1:45:16] super oblate her
[1:45:17] because they do this in humans too and
[1:45:20] then they would take and match
[1:45:21] the sperm with the egg
[1:45:24] and then they'd take that fertilized
[1:45:27] embryo
[1:45:28] and they would take it and freeze it
[1:45:30] this too would have
[1:45:32] um we don't know it's an indefinite
[1:45:35] amount of years of
[1:45:36] life that would be held down in that
[1:45:39] nitrogen
[1:45:40] and and so you know it would
[1:45:44] it would be that way for animal
[1:45:46] reproduction
[1:45:48] we found that here locally we had
[1:45:51] a a cow that was on the lakabi dairy
[1:45:55] farm
[1:45:56] i don't know that they were totally
[1:45:57] successful with their breeding plum
[1:45:59] program but they had a cow a jersey cow
[1:46:03] she gave a phenomenal amount of milk
[1:46:06] that was way
[1:46:07] over the records for the state and for
[1:46:10] most of the united
[1:46:12] usa and they wanted her genes
[1:46:15] well you know they could get sons of her
[1:46:18] but if they could get
[1:46:19] you know if they could reproduce more of
[1:46:22] her
[1:46:23] hundreds of her so what they would do is
[1:46:26] they would
[1:46:26] super oblate this lockaby dairy cow
[1:46:30] and jesus jersey and they would super
[1:46:32] ovulate her
[1:46:33] they would get and and harvest the
[1:46:37] um the eggs from her they would mix it
[1:46:39] with the best
[1:46:40] bulls of the country and they would then
[1:46:44] take those embryos and they would just
[1:46:47] find a surrogate mother
[1:46:50] so it might be a black angus she could
[1:46:52] be a scrub cow should be an old white
[1:46:54] face with long horns
[1:46:56] may not look like anything like a jersey
[1:46:58] whatsoever
[1:47:01] but they would take that egg and and
[1:47:03] sperm
[1:47:04] and they would insert it into the
[1:47:07] this surrogate mother now when this calf
[1:47:11] was born
[1:47:12] it was full blood jersey
[1:47:17] it had no characteristics whatsoever
[1:47:20] of its surrogate mother though
[1:47:24] that mother would give birth to it that
[1:47:26] mother would lick it
[1:47:27] that mother would move to it like it was
[1:47:29] her baby it was her baby
[1:47:31] in all sense but not one speck of her
[1:47:35] blood was in this offspring
[1:47:39] amen now god's been doing this a long
[1:47:42] time before man
[1:47:43] ever thought about doing things and what
[1:47:46] god
[1:47:46] did is he didn't borrow from the womb of
[1:47:49] mary an egg
[1:47:50] he created it
[1:47:54] do you have to get the sperm and he took
[1:47:56] any place
[1:47:57] right there in mary's body
[1:48:01] and mary gave birth to it and mary nurse
[1:48:04] that impressed into her bosom
[1:48:05] but there wasn't one speck of mary's
[1:48:08] blood in it
[1:48:09] amen you're not saying this morning by
[1:48:12] jude's blood
[1:48:13] you are saved by the blood of god it was
[1:48:16] god
[1:48:17] who gave that blood it was god who has
[1:48:20] redeemed you
[1:48:21] [Applause]
[1:48:27] now as we look into this for a moment
[1:48:32] i want you to think of that this blood
[1:48:36] cell
[1:48:37] would multiply it would become the body
[1:48:40] of our lord it was it was the beginning
[1:48:43] of the creation of god that's who
[1:48:46] jesus is he was the one that was filled
[1:48:50] with the holy blood he was that holy one
[1:48:53] with holy blood even the blood of god
[1:48:55] that tabernacle came to birth
[1:48:57] he grew to be a man he went down to
[1:49:00] jordan
[1:49:01] and down in jordan is where the
[1:49:03] sacrifice was washed
[1:49:05] on of of john in the river called jordan
[1:49:09] and with that when that acceptable
[1:49:10] sacrifice rose up
[1:49:12] from out of the water god came and then
[1:49:15] dwelt him
[1:49:17] filling him with the spirit without
[1:49:19] measure
[1:49:20] and when jesus died and shed his blood
[1:49:23] the perfect life of god was liberated
[1:49:28] everybody remember it was first wrapped
[1:49:30] up in a blood cell
[1:49:31] but then when he died it liberated
[1:49:35] the life of god not just to be bring
[1:49:38] cleansing for you
[1:49:39] but so that the life of your sacrifice
[1:49:43] could come back about you the worshiper
[1:49:47] amen amen thanks be to god
[1:49:51] oh now i want to stop just for a moment
[1:49:54] what a blood this
[1:49:55] is let's just go down this uh avenue in
[1:49:58] just a moment
[1:49:59] let's think of it along this line in the
[1:50:02] old testament
[1:50:04] god would tell them to bring a lamb and
[1:50:07] that lamb was to be without blemish
[1:50:13] that lamb had been had to be examined
[1:50:16] and that makes sure
[1:50:18] there was nothing wrong no infirmities
[1:50:20] no mars
[1:50:22] it couldn't be they couldn't offer a
[1:50:24] crippled lamb they couldn't offer
[1:50:26] a a blemish lamb it had to be perfect
[1:50:30] a perfect lamb
[1:50:33] and i want you to know that you know
[1:50:36] when the
[1:50:37] when they brought the lamb that to the
[1:50:40] priest
[1:50:41] the even for the for the token there in
[1:50:44] exodus 14 where the blood was to be a
[1:50:47] token a sign
[1:50:48] so the death angel would pass over it
[1:50:51] was the lamb
[1:50:52] that was kept up for so many days and
[1:50:55] examined that
[1:50:57] and then once it was examined then it
[1:51:00] was taken the priest
[1:51:01] and if it was up without blemish it
[1:51:03] would be accepted
[1:51:06] for the worshiper amen now i want you to
[1:51:09] notice
[1:51:10] a man could come in he could be a sinner
[1:51:13] maybe he had done wrong maybe he had
[1:51:16] committed adultery maybe he had lustful
[1:51:18] passions
[1:51:22] but he was a sinner he had done wrong
[1:51:24] maybe he had done his neighbor wrong he
[1:51:26] he needed redemption he needed
[1:51:30] he needs something to die in his place
[1:51:33] because he wasn't
[1:51:34] worthy to meet a god who who looked
[1:51:37] for for someone without a blemish
[1:51:40] and when he comes into the priest's
[1:51:42] presence
[1:51:43] and he brings he bringing out his lamb
[1:51:47] the priest never ever looks
[1:51:50] at the man to see if the man is worthy
[1:51:55] to see if he's been good to see if he's
[1:51:59] never made a mistake
[1:52:01] to see that he's without blemish he
[1:52:03] don't pay any attention
[1:52:05] to the man
[1:52:08] he is his eyes are on the lamb
[1:52:12] and if the lamb is accepted
[1:52:16] no matter how without believers or how
[1:52:20] much blemish the man
[1:52:21] is but if the lamb is accepted
[1:52:24] then the worshiper is accepted
[1:52:28] hallelujah i want you to know our lamb
[1:52:32] that we present this morning it's jesus
[1:52:34] christ
[1:52:35] the lamb of god from the foundation of
[1:52:37] the world
[1:52:38] are you with me now and we can present
[1:52:40] him as the blemish
[1:52:42] spotless lamb and god is not even
[1:52:45] looking at you
[1:52:46] as you come to him but to see if you've
[1:52:48] accepted the blood sacrifice
[1:52:51] of the lamb
[1:52:57] there god came and indwelted him
[1:53:02] filling him with the spirit without
[1:53:04] measure at the river jordan
[1:53:06] he died shed his blood that the perfect
[1:53:09] life of the lamb
[1:53:10] could be liberated now that's another
[1:53:12] thing
[1:53:14] you see the life of the sacrifice of
[1:53:17] that
[1:53:18] lamb the wooly lamb it could not come
[1:53:21] back the innocency
[1:53:23] of that lamb could not come back on the
[1:53:25] worshiper
[1:53:27] so the worshiper after slaying the lamb
[1:53:29] and his sins cleansed
[1:53:31] he would walk out still sinning
[1:53:34] same desires that he had before he had
[1:53:37] afterwards
[1:53:38] maybe he was a drunkard he would still
[1:53:40] be a drunkard
[1:53:42] amen the habits that he had the old
[1:53:45] sinful nature was all still there
[1:53:47] because the innocency of that lamb could
[1:53:50] not come back upon him
[1:53:53] somebody with me now but i'll tell you
[1:53:55] it's different with this line
[1:53:58] because this lamb did not die just to
[1:54:01] take away your sin
[1:54:02] this lamb died so his life could come
[1:54:06] back on you
[1:54:08] so that the very innocency of the life
[1:54:11] of the lamb of god can come upon your
[1:54:14] life and
[1:54:14] change you forever where your desires
[1:54:17] are no longer the same desire
[1:54:20] sin is gone and dead is midnight
[1:54:26] hallelujah i'll tell you what it's
[1:54:29] tracking when we get to look at it
[1:54:31] amen because what we saw there was
[1:54:33] jehovah come down
[1:54:34] crying over a manure pile they're born
[1:54:38] in the stable
[1:54:39] amen born in a mangerless trial
[1:54:43] and this is an everlasting sign to us
[1:54:46] amen
[1:54:47] it is a sign of of the the seed
[1:54:50] of the woman that was given by god to
[1:54:53] take away sin when god will become
[1:54:56] created in flesh
[1:54:59] just like your flesh it's called the
[1:55:03] condescension of god or
[1:55:05] god in morphe god changing form
[1:55:09] he was god but he would morphe
[1:55:13] he would change forms he would take
[1:55:16] leave the form of god to take on the
[1:55:19] form
[1:55:20] of a servant what was he doing he was
[1:55:24] coming a servant to take away your sins
[1:55:32] and he would come not in a king's palace
[1:55:37] but he'd come so the very lowest of us
[1:55:40] could identify with him
[1:55:44] he didn't come just to save those who
[1:55:47] were royal
[1:55:48] blood in our opinions belonged to the
[1:55:50] children of the king of israel of each
[1:55:52] uh of england no he came that
[1:55:56] the lowest of us the lowest of the
[1:55:59] lowest
[1:56:00] the armpit of humanity
[1:56:04] the dreads amen he came down to
[1:56:08] to save you to save me
[1:56:12] to find us no matter what condition
[1:56:15] we're in
[1:56:18] hallelujah oh he didn't come looking for
[1:56:21] the high
[1:56:22] mighty he even said i didn't even come
[1:56:24] to call the righteousness to repentance
[1:56:26] i called to call the sinner to repent
[1:56:31] this is him a friend of sinners and
[1:56:34] publicans
[1:56:36] amen that's still him today he's the
[1:56:38] friends of the junker
[1:56:40] he's the friends of a dope head he's the
[1:56:42] brand of the prostitute
[1:56:44] he's the friend of the effeminate
[1:56:48] he's the friend of sinners but he don't
[1:56:51] leave you
[1:56:52] in your sins he comes to save you
[1:56:56] from your sin and lift you up out of sin
[1:56:59] [Applause]
[1:57:06] that's a sign to this puffed-up and
[1:57:10] pseudo-intellectuals those who think
[1:57:12] they know something their nose up in the
[1:57:14] air
[1:57:14] and they're the goody-goody because
[1:57:16] they've got a degree behind their name
[1:57:19] because they've been successful in life
[1:57:24] they've evolved their own theology and
[1:57:26] deny the truth of god
[1:57:28] jehovah god crying a crime baby in this
[1:57:32] tinking
[1:57:37] and barn we think we got a right to be
[1:57:39] proud and
[1:57:40] hold up our nose and criticize and
[1:57:42] acting as though we're somebody
[1:57:45] he became a nobody so you can become a
[1:57:48] somebody
[1:57:49] [Applause]
[1:57:50] amen come on he would actually go to
[1:57:53] cross
[1:57:54] and become a sinner taking on your sins
[1:57:58] and become lost and go to hell in your
[1:58:00] place
[1:58:02] amen so that you can be saved i want you
[1:58:06] to know this lab
[1:58:07] took the penalty that you deserved
[1:58:12] now this is the things the angel was
[1:58:14] teaching
[1:58:16] he was teaching us by the sacrifice he
[1:58:18] was teaching us by
[1:58:19] the commandments that he gave by the
[1:58:21] words that he gave
[1:58:23] now notice god said
[1:58:27] that he would give us a sign this
[1:58:29] everlasting sign
[1:58:31] and this sign would be jehovah
[1:58:34] despised to reject it jehovah's standing
[1:58:38] in the courtyard bruised
[1:58:41] and and bleeding with thorns on his brow
[1:58:44] and spit on his face
[1:58:46] mocked and said it not while hypocrites
[1:58:50] would jeer and
[1:58:51] and dared him to come down off the cross
[1:58:53] that was jehovah dying
[1:58:55] jehovah praying and nothing happening
[1:58:59] so that you could pray and something
[1:59:00] happened
[1:59:02] amen did you overdied it's a sign for
[1:59:05] all men it's a great sign
[1:59:07] darkness came up on the earth then they
[1:59:09] put him in a tomb
[1:59:10] very late three days and nights until an
[1:59:13] earthquake
[1:59:14] shattered the gloom of the night and it
[1:59:15] came forward jehovah came forth
[1:59:17] jehovah sent it on high and then jehovah
[1:59:20] returns to
[1:59:21] indwell his church that's the holy ghost
[1:59:25] we have today
[1:59:26] it all became like a russian mighty wind
[1:59:29] amen oh flames of fire
[1:59:32] as it settled over 120 and jehovah was
[1:59:35] giving birth
[1:59:36] to more sons i'm glad to be a son of his
[1:59:40] today
[1:59:41] i'm glad to say i have the same life
[1:59:44] that he had
[1:59:45] the same light that was in him has also
[1:59:47] been
[1:59:48] given to me by a new birth
[1:59:51] amen jehovah came back to walk in the
[1:59:54] midst of his church
[1:59:55] to empower his people amen this time
[1:59:58] he came to stay in his people saying
[2:00:01] i'll never leave your versation
[2:00:04] and right now again jehovah heals the
[2:00:06] sick
[2:00:08] amen he raises the dead he manifests
[2:00:11] himself by the spirit
[2:00:12] jehovah came back speaking in tongues
[2:00:14] and giving the answer back in
[2:00:15] interpretation
[2:00:16] that's our jehovah amen jehovah came
[2:00:19] down
[2:00:20] and he raised a prostitute to sin no
[2:00:22] more
[2:00:23] he came down to the drunkard with the
[2:00:25] fly blows upon his face
[2:00:27] amen as he lays unconscious in a gutter
[2:00:30] and when he
[2:00:31] came to manifest himself in flesh and
[2:00:34] through flesh
[2:00:36] christ in you the hope of glory he came
[2:00:40] to shed his blood
[2:00:42] now we're bringing this right down now
[2:00:45] i'm not going to be as long this morning
[2:00:48] because i want to bring this down to you
[2:00:50] as
[2:00:51] as a gospel message i want you to
[2:00:54] realize
[2:00:55] the first thing was god
[2:00:59] this was god and then jesus came
[2:01:03] as god in the form of a man
[2:01:06] now that's hard for people to wrap their
[2:01:08] mind around
[2:01:10] that god would be so caring about
[2:01:13] you
[2:01:17] that he would leave his throne in glory
[2:01:21] for one sinner
[2:01:25] come on john 3 16 is about god so loved
[2:01:29] me
[2:01:32] that he gave his only begotten son
[2:01:35] because of his
[2:01:36] love that he had from me he would leave
[2:01:39] all of glory to come down the earth
[2:01:41] the love that he had for you
[2:01:44] amen and god now the creator of his own
[2:01:48] creation he would come down
[2:01:51] in the as a creator himself so much
[2:01:54] that he was god that he was a being on
[2:01:57] earth a being of time therefore
[2:01:59] he created himself a body to live in god
[2:02:02] himself created
[2:02:04] a body to live in for himself
[2:02:09] and he would start a new creation a
[2:02:12] creation of himself for god was created
[2:02:14] in human form jesus christ
[2:02:16] his son god dwelt he built a tabernacle
[2:02:19] flesh and bones and lived in that
[2:02:21] tabernacle
[2:02:22] it would be god emmanuel god with us
[2:02:26] he built himself a house to live in so
[2:02:28] he could reflect his word to his
[2:02:31] subjects through that you know what god
[2:02:33] is when you see christ
[2:02:36] now listen church god has done something
[2:02:39] for us
[2:02:40] in this generation that is absolutely
[2:02:43] marvelous
[2:02:44] because the gentiles worshiped hundreds
[2:02:47] of gods
[2:02:49] so that when they brought that into to
[2:02:51] christianity it was hard to see
[2:02:52] god in in different manifestations
[2:02:56] without believing in three persons of
[2:02:57] god
[2:02:58] so you can't hardly get it for a heathen
[2:03:01] to
[2:03:01] to accept there's only one god or there
[2:03:05] there's only one person it's of god
[2:03:09] amen now there's many forms of god come
[2:03:11] on
[2:03:12] because he would take on another form
[2:03:16] he would take on the form of el shaddai
[2:03:19] he'd take on the form of elohim he would
[2:03:22] take on the form of melchizedek
[2:03:26] amen not melchizedek would then become
[2:03:29] jesus christ now jesus christ the man
[2:03:32] the flesh
[2:03:33] was not melchizedek but melchizedek
[2:03:36] was jesus christ amen because
[2:03:40] as as jesus he did listen as a
[2:03:43] man he there he had a father he had a
[2:03:46] mother he
[2:03:47] he had beginning of days he had ended up
[2:03:49] life but not melchizedek
[2:03:52] but melchizedek come to dwell in this
[2:03:55] time being
[2:03:56] called jesus in order to give his life
[2:03:59] for redemption
[2:04:01] oh how wonderful that is to realize that
[2:04:04] that god would make himself
[2:04:06] manifest in human flesh and in human
[2:04:09] form
[2:04:11] now god so loved the world
[2:04:15] now let's take him for a moment let's go
[2:04:18] back
[2:04:19] at what he would do he would come down
[2:04:24] to israel a people who were slaves
[2:04:27] a people who their lives were thought
[2:04:29] nothing of they were lower than dogs
[2:04:32] they were mistreated they were abused
[2:04:35] they were
[2:04:36] there was a mixed multitude that went
[2:04:38] out with them because
[2:04:39] there were many of them that were were a
[2:04:42] mixed race
[2:04:44] because of of the the things that was
[2:04:46] happening to them
[2:04:47] as slaves down in egypt
[2:04:51] it was a horrible condition but god said
[2:04:54] i have heard
[2:04:56] the cry by reason of your taskmasters
[2:05:01] i have seen your sorrows and i
[2:05:04] have come down to deliver you
[2:05:09] this is the care of the angel of his
[2:05:11] presence
[2:05:13] that he sees every heartache that he
[2:05:16] sees every problem
[2:05:17] he sees every sinner and he comes down
[2:05:21] to say to seek and to save
[2:05:24] that which is lost i say what a redeemer
[2:05:28] what a caring savior that would come
[2:05:31] down to the insignificant the nobody
[2:05:33] that forgotten
[2:05:36] and say i have remembered a promise to
[2:05:39] you
[2:05:40] amen for i have come down to deliver
[2:05:44] are you with me now amen i'm going to
[2:05:46] try to bring this right on down to the
[2:05:48] end now as we
[2:05:49] as we bring this to a close today where
[2:05:51] you can see what i'm talking about
[2:05:53] the angel cares the angel is concerned
[2:05:59] the angel is concerned about your need
[2:06:03] you might be a parent today that's got a
[2:06:06] lost
[2:06:06] child a man that has grieved your heart
[2:06:10] that has offended your soul that has
[2:06:13] wounded you
[2:06:13] in every kind of way that has
[2:06:16] disappointed you in every kind of way
[2:06:18] but i want you to know god he cares he's
[2:06:21] still the angel who cares
[2:06:24] amen he cares so much that a little
[2:06:26] black insignificant woman
[2:06:29] would cause a storm there in tennessee
[2:06:32] as she would as she she began to pray
[2:06:35] god god i'll be your
[2:06:38] cinematic woman you gave me a child
[2:06:42] i didn't deserve it i tried to raise him
[2:06:44] right
[2:06:45] but here he is dying with this venereal
[2:06:47] disease
[2:06:48] and here he's gasping his last breath
[2:06:51] and he's out on a dark ocean somewhere
[2:06:53] and he's rowing and i'm lost and i'm
[2:06:56] lost oh i'm lost
[2:06:57] i can't find my way i'm lost that's the
[2:07:00] way you are this morning sinner
[2:07:02] you can't find your own way
[2:07:05] amen you can't clean yourself up you
[2:07:08] might be like the leopard a lick is pot
[2:07:10] but it only makes it brighter
[2:07:12] amen you might try to clean yourself up
[2:07:14] only to fall right down in the mud again
[2:07:17] but i want to tell you there's a god who
[2:07:19] cares
[2:07:20] there's a god who is concerned about
[2:07:23] your lost condition
[2:07:24] he is concerned about your lost children
[2:07:27] your lost sons and daughters
[2:07:32] amen and when the saints of god begin to
[2:07:34] pray
[2:07:35] and begin to expect god to move that's
[2:07:37] when god starts moving
[2:07:39] that's when the angels start starin
[2:07:44] this little woman began to cry out god
[2:07:48] god i'm your shooting my woman you gave
[2:07:50] me a child
