[37:26] [Music]
[37:28] y'all just sing this song with me.
[37:31] [Music]
[37:34] And I know
[37:36] the Bible says
[37:40] when you've done all that you can to
[37:43] stand,
[37:45] just stand.
[37:50] Oh, and I know
[37:53] that it's hard sometimes
[37:56] to look through these tear stained eyes
[38:01] and still see
[38:04] the scars in
[38:07] those hands.
[38:09] [Music]
[38:13] But just you
[38:15] keep this in mind
[38:18] when hope seems
[38:21] so hard to find
[38:24] that surely
[38:27] you've not reached the end.
[38:35] And when the whole world
[38:39] has let you down,
[38:42] Jesus,
[38:44] you know, he can still be found.
[38:47] And when you've tried
[38:50] it all,
[38:52] just look to him.
[38:57] Oh, look to him.
[39:01] for him. Only
[39:04] when sorrow
[39:07] makes lonely
[39:10] all the days
[39:13] when the night closes
[39:16] in.
[39:18] [Music]
[39:20] And he can vanish
[39:24] all your midnight.
[39:27] And he can call back
[39:30] the sunlight.
[39:33] So how
[39:36] will it end?
[39:38] Look to him.
[39:44] Now I know
[39:47] that questions can't
[39:51] Lord. They can get so hard to
[39:54] understand.
[39:56] But then
[40:01] but I know someone.
[40:04] Oh, he knows it all.
[40:07] And his eyes see even that little
[40:10] sparrow fall.
[40:13] Yet he can hold back
[40:15] the sea
[40:17] with just one hand.
[40:22] He's
[40:24] so big you ride
[40:27] on the breeze that blows.
[40:30] Yet in your heart, the only one that
[40:33] knows
[40:35] the heartache
[40:38] and all the trouble you're in.
[40:43] [Music]
[40:45] Oh, and when life sings
[40:50] everything but good,
[40:53] remember him, cuz he's the only one that
[40:56] could.
[40:59] And if you don't
[41:01] dare,
[41:03] just look to him.
[41:07] Oh,
[41:09] and look to him.
[41:12] For he only
[41:16] when sorrow
[41:18] makes lonely
[41:21] all the days
[41:24] when the night close
[41:27] in.
[41:31] And he can vanish
[41:35] all your midnight.
[41:38] And he can call back
[41:41] the sunlight.
[41:44] So how
[41:46] will it end?
[41:49] And look to him.
[41:53] Oh,
[41:55] look to him
[41:58] for he only
[42:01] when sorrow
[42:04] makes lonely
[42:06] all the days
[42:09] when the night close.
[42:15] Oh, and he can banish
[42:20] your midnight.
[42:23] And he can call back
[42:26] to sunlight.
[42:29] So how
[42:32] will it
[42:34] look to hear?

[49:42] Amen.
[49:44] Ain't it wonderful? We can declare he's
[49:46] the same God.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That he is changes not
[49:53] &gt;&gt; that he's here today to manifest himself
[49:56] and all of his glory and all of his
[49:58] power for you and for you and for your
[50:01] life
[50:02] &gt;&gt; for the needs of all his children.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; How wonderful he is to us.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; How we appreciate him.
[50:11] Brother Timothy started a song, the
[50:14] service with the song of Bula Land. If
[50:17] you can just softly just play that for a
[50:20] moment.
[50:22] [Music]
[50:24] Most of you know and probably have heard
[50:27] by now
[50:29] that our precious brother Ed Bisll
[50:34] passed from this life this past
[50:36] Wednesday night.
[50:38] He was at the age of 90.
[50:41] He would have been 91 just a few weeks
[50:43] over about I think the 3rd of October.
[50:48] And as the news reached us Wednesday
[50:50] night, our hearts were stirred with
[50:56] with both sorrow and yet reverence.
[51:02] In fact,
[51:04] speaking with brother Ron Spencer, he
[51:06] told me, he said, "I wept all night."
[51:10] And I said, "Well,
[51:12] my emotions were I was just stunned
[51:17] to think about where we are at this time
[51:21] in the journey."
[51:23] [Music]
[51:25] But it was a great soldier of the cross,
[51:27] I believe, a general in the army of the
[51:29] Lord. He's now laid down his sword,
[51:34] crossed over to his reward.
[51:37] It was about 5:34 p.m.
[51:41] there on the West Coast that he passed
[51:44] from this body of humiliation to be
[51:47] clothed with his theophony.
[51:49] That's a heavenly tabernacle that's not
[51:51] made with hands. and he's now joined
[51:55] that great cloud of witnesses, the
[51:58] millions of believers who have gone on
[52:01] before.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Bisc was more than a preacher.
[52:06] He was a father. Yes.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; As Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 4:15,
[52:11] "Though you have may have 10,000
[52:14] instructors in Christ, yet have you not
[52:17] many fathers,
[52:19] for in Christ Jesus, I have begotten you
[52:22] through the gospel."
[52:24] That was Brother Ed,
[52:26] a father in the faith. He was a
[52:28] spiritual patriarch to many of us.
[52:32] He mentored with grace. He strengthened
[52:34] with wisdom. He encouraged with
[52:36] unshakable vision.
[52:40] He hands in the hearts of the people.
[52:43] He never was interested in building his
[52:45] own kingdom. He didn't gather men to
[52:48] himself.
[52:50] He pointed them to Christ.
[52:52] He did his best to equip them and to re
[52:55] release them into the harvest.
[52:58] His zeal for the truth was unmatched.
[53:03] His
[53:06] passion was,
[53:08] if you know him, it was contagious
[53:10] [Music]
[53:12] and his legacy immeasurable.
[53:15] And words will fall short to describe
[53:19] the loss that I feel today. And as I
[53:22] will be at the memorial service
[53:25] Sunday and will speak there with brother
[53:28] Ron Spencer,
[53:31] I I feel it at lost to express the right
[53:34] words
[53:36] cuz truly a gap has opened in our ranks
[53:39] and we find ourself asking this
[53:42] question. Where are we in time?
[53:46] Where do we go from here?
[53:48] are. Maybe some will even ask who will
[53:51] rise to fill the space he has left.
[53:55] And I say truthfully,
[53:58] his shoes cannot be filled.
[54:02] But his voice,
[54:04] though now silent, can still echo
[54:06] through ours. We can carry his fire. We
[54:09] can carry his burden. We can follow the
[54:12] trail that he blazed.
[54:16] Paul says in the book of Hebrews,
[54:18] remember them that have the rule over
[54:20] you, who have spoken to you the word of
[54:22] God whose faith follow considering the
[54:26] end of their conversation.
[54:29] So in this he commanded us to reflect on
[54:33] the lives of those who led us in the
[54:35] word and to consider their conduct and
[54:38] to follow their faith.
[54:40] [Music]
[54:42] And when we consider brother Ed's in
[54:46] We don't find regret
[54:49] but reward.
[54:51] We don't find failure but faithfulness
[54:54] and fruitfulness.
[54:56] Not silence
[54:58] but a legacy that speaks.
[55:02] As Paul said in
[55:04] first Timothy,
[55:06] he fought a good fight. He finished his
[55:09] course.
[55:11] He kept the faith. And now there is laid
[55:14] up for him a crown. No, not one of gold
[55:18] but of righteousness
[55:21] made not by man but prepared by God.
[55:27] Psalms 116 it says, "Precious in the
[55:30] sight of the Lord is the death of his
[55:32] saints."
[55:34] So this is not a loss.
[55:37] It was a homecoming.
[55:40] Psalms 37:37 says to mark the perfect
[55:43] man and behold the upright. For the end
[55:46] of that man is peace.
[55:49] His end is was not tragedy. It was
[55:51] peace. It was a life that was well
[55:54] lived. A faith that was wellkept.
[55:57] [Music]
[55:58] Revelation 14 says, "Blessed are they
[56:01] that die in the Lord that they may rest
[56:05] from their labors and their works do
[56:08] follow them.
[56:11] His influence marches on. His words walk
[56:16] behind him like a procession of light.
[56:19] His life left a path that we too can
[56:22] follow."
[56:24] So I say
[56:27] go rest for a little while. Brother
[56:29] Biscll,
[56:31] join the fellowship of the saints.
[56:34] Paul, Wesley, Luther, Brother Brandham,
[56:38] and countless others who've longed for
[56:40] this day. But I say, don't rest too
[56:44] long.
[56:46] The trumpet will sound, the Lord shall
[56:49] descend,
[56:51] and you shall rise. Not in a theophony
[56:54] this time, but in a glorified body
[56:58] reunited with the living saints
[57:01] to finish the mystery and to fulfill the
[57:05] promise.
[57:06] And to that I say,
[57:09] even so,
[57:11] come Lord Jesus, come.
[57:14] [Music]
[57:17] Let's bow our heads.
[57:22] [Music]
[57:33] Father,
[57:35] as I stop today and pause,
[57:40] beginning with this moment of silence to
[57:42] remember
[57:44] a life that was well-lived,
[57:47] a testimony of Jesus Christ.
[57:52] Lord, we want to thank you for brother
[57:53] Biscll.
[57:56] Lord, I I can hardly believe that
[57:58] chapter is closed, that that era is
[58:01] finished.
[58:04] Lord, I can remember the mighty messages
[58:06] and sermons that he preached.
[58:09] I can remember his last that he preached
[58:12] here at Evening Light tabernacle and
[58:14] described how as he sat on a log
[58:20] and his whole life was exposed
[58:24] and there and that moment of time
[58:26] changed
[58:28] eternally.
[58:30] [Music]
[58:32] May you bless his family today. Sister
[58:34] Ruth
[58:36] who suffers such great loss.
[58:39] His daughters,
[58:41] his loving
[58:44] grandchildren, his son-in-laws,
[58:47] the extended family, the great
[58:49] grandchildren, all of them, you know
[58:51] them.
[58:53] Thank you, Father, for his life, his
[58:55] testimony.
[58:57] a large number, a great host are
[59:00] tributes to his ministry and serve the
[59:02] Lord and follow him. But if there be any
[59:05] that are outside of the ark of safety, I
[59:08] pray that your gracious arm will reach
[59:11] over to them and touch them during this
[59:14] time.
[59:15] Bless us. I pray today as we
[59:19] put on the armor and we step forward
[59:23] where one of our ranks has fallen and
[59:26] been taken home.
[59:28] May we press for the mark for the prize
[59:30] of the high calling in Christ Jesus.
[59:33] Bless us today as we worship together in
[59:36] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Help me sing
[59:43] that. Build a land.
[59:55] And someday
[1:00:02] I'll stand
[1:00:06] there. My home
[1:00:11] shall be eternal.
[1:00:17] Buy
[1:00:22] you alive.
[1:00:26] Amen. God bless you. Thank you. We
[1:00:30] appreciate the Lord today and his
[1:00:32] goodness. As I look over at the
[1:00:34] congregation today, I want to especially
[1:00:38] welcome again our brother James Hollis
[1:00:40] back there again who's who's brave the
[1:00:43] the the the highways to come and be with
[1:00:48] us again today. And I'll tell you what,
[1:00:51] that encourages me to to preach.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. To put my heart all into it.
[1:00:59] People that make such an effort. We have
[1:01:01] brother Gary, sister Barbara Stany here.
[1:01:04] Been longing to be in service with us
[1:01:06] here again this morning. They also come
[1:01:09] from a long ways away and they uh are
[1:01:13] here to worship God with us and we so
[1:01:16] love and appreciate you both and
[1:01:19] thankful that you were able to come and
[1:01:21] be with us today. It makes it a very
[1:01:23] special time.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm going to be going away,
[1:01:27] as you know, uh going to brother Kelly's
[1:01:30] to preach his his camp meeting. Brother
[1:01:33] Eron and Brother Timothy will go with
[1:01:34] us. Brother Ron has canceled going
[1:01:36] there. Instead, flying directly to
[1:01:38] Vancouver. I'll preach there Thursday
[1:01:41] night and Friday night. Saturday, we'll
[1:01:43] fly to Vancouver.
[1:01:45] And then then to we'll preach with
[1:01:48] Brother Ron in the memorial service and
[1:01:52] then we will fly back. I will fly back
[1:01:54] to to Saskatoon and continue there and
[1:01:58] be back the following Thursday. So, keep
[1:02:00] me in prayer. There's a lot on my plate
[1:02:03] and uh you know, a lot of responsibility
[1:02:06] that goes with it. You know, praying
[1:02:08] that we have the right words, the right
[1:02:10] messages for the convention for brother
[1:02:12] Kelly. We don't take that lightly. And
[1:02:15] um also that we'll have the right words
[1:02:18] to say for brother Biscll. and this
[1:02:20] morning that God will help me to hurry
[1:02:24] up.
[1:02:27] So, I want you to listen fast
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; because we got a lot of ground to
[1:02:32] covered and I'm going to be speaking
[1:02:34] today on the eternal prescription. And
[1:02:37] of course we are we are talking about
[1:02:39] the mountains that we have to to move
[1:02:41] out of the way because we we are here
[1:02:45] you know preparing for the coming of the
[1:02:47] Lord and making the path smooth. Amen.
[1:02:51] And uh bringing down the the mountains
[1:02:54] of unbelief and lifting up the the um
[1:02:59] the valleys of neglected truths. And so
[1:03:02] mountains have to be moved, valleys have
[1:03:04] to be moved, the road has to be prepared
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; for the coming of the Lord. And so we're
[1:03:09] going to start with the words of Jesus
[1:03:12] that there was um a man of the Pharisees
[1:03:16] named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[1:03:18] The same came to Jesus by night, and
[1:03:21] said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou
[1:03:23] art a teacher come from God. For no man
[1:03:26] can do these miracles that thou doest
[1:03:28] except God be with him." And Jesus
[1:03:30] answered and said unto them, "Verily,
[1:03:32] verily, I say unto thee, except a man be
[1:03:34] born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:03:39] of God." And Nicodemus said unto him,
[1:03:42] "How can a man be born when he is old?
[1:03:45] Can he enter the second time into his
[1:03:47] mother's womb and be born?"
[1:03:49] And and Jesus answered, "Verily, verily,
[1:03:52] I say unto thee, except a man be born of
[1:03:55] water and of the spirit, he cannot enter
[1:03:57] the kingdom of God. That which is born
[1:04:00] of the flesh is flesh, and that which is
[1:04:02] born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not
[1:04:05] that I said unto thee, you must be born
[1:04:07] again. the when bloweth, where it list,
[1:04:10] and thou hears the sound thereof, but
[1:04:12] cannot tell when it cometh, and whether
[1:04:15] it goeth, and so is everyone that is
[1:04:19] born of the spirit. And of course, we
[1:04:21] know this would be where the wind would
[1:04:24] blow on in Acts chapter 2. And men and
[1:04:28] women for the first time would be born
[1:04:31] of the spirit of God,
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; receiving the Holy Ghost. God bless you.
[1:04:35] Can be seated. Now, as we as we look at
[1:04:39] this for a moment and and um I just
[1:04:41] wanted to go back and remember that we
[1:04:44] spoke last week of the new birth lost
[1:04:47] now restored
[1:04:49] and how through the ages the truth of
[1:04:51] the new birth was was lost. And um so
[1:04:57] the complete truth of being justified,
[1:04:59] sanctified, filled with the spirit which
[1:05:02] is the token is was lost. And God gave a
[1:05:06] prescription on the day of Pentecost and
[1:05:09] men have watered it down
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; and they have changed the formula until
[1:05:15] it no longer inoculates against sin.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Now it may have enough of the formula to
[1:05:22] treat sin, but it doesn't cure it.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And what was given on the day of
[1:05:27] Pentecost was intended for and it
[1:05:30] produced a sin cure. It completely
[1:05:33] cleans the soul and eradicated sin
[1:05:36] disease. Now when Jesus preached his
[1:05:39] first doctrine that we have read here,
[1:05:41] it is it was the new birth. It and he
[1:05:45] taught emphatically that it was to be
[1:05:48] born of the spirit.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; And of course, no one but Jesus had ever
[1:05:54] been born of the spirit. He was the
[1:05:56] first of the God race. He was the first
[1:06:00] born of ever creature and he was the
[1:06:03] first of the new creation. So he
[1:06:07] received the spirit at the river Jordan,
[1:06:10] but everyone else had to wait until
[1:06:13] redemption was secured. Now, I'm going
[1:06:16] to go over this for you because Jesus
[1:06:19] makes a wonderful statement in the last
[1:06:21] day, the great day of the feast, that he
[1:06:23] stood and cried and said, "If any man
[1:06:26] thirst, let him come to me and drink."
[1:06:29] And then he said, "He that believeth on
[1:06:31] me, those who truly believe on me, as
[1:06:34] the scripture has said, then here will
[1:06:37] be the proof of their faith, that their
[1:06:41] faith is complete, that out of his
[1:06:44] innermost being or out of his belly
[1:06:47] shall flow rivers of living water."
[1:06:50] And then he says, "But this spake he,"
[1:06:53] now watch this is in parentheses because
[1:06:55] John now will will explain why he says
[1:06:58] this. He said, "But this spake he of the
[1:07:00] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:07:03] should receive bec for the Holy Ghost
[1:07:07] was not yet given because Jesus was not
[1:07:12] yet glorified."
[1:07:15] So we we can see there that the spirit
[1:07:18] could not be given until redemption was
[1:07:22] complete.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Now he says for the Holy Ghost was not
[1:07:27] yet given. And so uh again because Jesus
[1:07:33] was not yet glorified. Now these this is
[1:07:36] important or else the apostle John would
[1:07:39] not put this in here to explain even
[1:07:43] what Jesus was saying here. Now
[1:07:46] glorified it refers to Jesus death,
[1:07:49] burial, resurrection and ascension back
[1:07:51] to the father. The spirit could not
[1:07:54] indwell believers permanently until
[1:07:58] Jesus had died to atone sin. Amen. Risen
[1:08:01] to conquer death, hell, and the grave
[1:08:03] and justify us and then ascended to the
[1:08:06] father um to be our high priest and our
[1:08:10] intercessor. So the blood had to be
[1:08:12] shed. It had to be accepted in the
[1:08:16] heavenly tabernacle before the spirit
[1:08:18] could be poured out on the earth. And so
[1:08:21] the spirit comes as the life of the
[1:08:25] risen Christ. The Holy Ghost is the
[1:08:29] spirit of the glorified Christ.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; The very life that was in him now
[1:08:36] released to indwell the believer.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus said this um that he that he
[1:08:43] says I will pray the father and he will
[1:08:46] give you the comforter. Now, as we look
[1:08:50] at this, I want to go back there. The
[1:08:52] Holy Ghost was not yet given because the
[1:08:55] blood had to be shed and and he had to
[1:08:58] die and be and atone. But now notice
[1:09:02] here there this these scriptures, I will
[1:09:05] pray the father, he'll give you another
[1:09:07] comforter, even the spirit of truth.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; So the spirit had not yet been given.
[1:09:13] Watch now. By the right hand of the
[1:09:15] father or the god exalted and having
[1:09:18] received of the father the promise of
[1:09:20] the holy ghost he has shed forth that
[1:09:22] which you now see and hear. So what
[1:09:25] happened on the day of pentecost is
[1:09:27] explained by Peter saying that he had
[1:09:30] received of the father the promise of
[1:09:32] the holy ghost and he has now shed this
[1:09:35] abroad. Now then again in John 16 Jesus
[1:09:40] loan word nevertheless I tell you the
[1:09:42] truth it is expedient for you that I go
[1:09:44] away for if I go not away the comforter
[1:09:47] will not come to you but if I depart I
[1:09:49] will send him unto you. So the comforter
[1:09:53] the spirit could not be given as a
[1:09:55] comforter until Jesus was exalted to the
[1:09:58] throne. And at Pentecost as as Peter
[1:10:02] declared, you know, by the right hand of
[1:10:05] God exalted, having received the father
[1:10:07] from the father, the promise of the holy
[1:10:09] ghost, he has shed this forth. So now it
[1:10:13] is the spirit of God coming back in or
[1:10:17] the spirit of Christ or Christ himself
[1:10:20] coming back in spirit form. He could not
[1:10:23] indwell them until he had completed his
[1:10:27] work and been exalted
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; right now. So now we notice this comes
[1:10:34] from a pattern in the Old Testament
[1:10:36] which is blood first and then spirit.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; In the tabernacle, blood was was
[1:10:42] sprinkled on the mercy seat before God's
[1:10:45] presence ever appeared. And then
[1:10:48] likewise Jesus had to present his blood
[1:10:52] before the throne in heaven and only
[1:10:54] then could the shikina glory the spirit
[1:10:56] fill the church as the new temple. Now
[1:11:00] Paul said that the spirit of God is a
[1:11:03] down payment.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the earnest of our
[1:11:07] inheritance and we could not receive the
[1:11:10] down payment until Christ had secured
[1:11:13] the full inheritance by his death and
[1:11:16] his resurrection.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; So now he says he says again I tell you
[1:11:21] the truth I it's expedient for me to go
[1:11:24] away. You see his glorification was
[1:11:28] necessary for the spirit to come. So he
[1:11:31] left physically so he can return
[1:11:34] spiritually not limited by a single
[1:11:38] human body but able to dwell in his
[1:11:41] church worldwide.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And in this way the church would do
[1:11:45] greater works because now he would be
[1:11:48] alive in and living and working in a
[1:11:52] multimembered body.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so you as we see here, we're
[1:11:59] going to think about this for a moment
[1:12:01] because many will say, "But brother Tim,
[1:12:04] you know, there are many in the Old
[1:12:06] Testament that were filled with the
[1:12:07] spirit." Even John the Baptist was
[1:12:09] filled with the spirit from his mother's
[1:12:12] womb. Now, I want to get this to you
[1:12:14] because John the Baptist filling was
[1:12:17] like all the prophets in the Old
[1:12:20] Testament. It was prophetic, not
[1:12:23] regenerative.
[1:12:24] All right. For the Bible said, "He will
[1:12:27] be great in the sight of the Lord, and
[1:12:29] he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:32] even from his mother's womb." Now, what
[1:12:34] was this? This was a special anointing
[1:12:38] for his prophetic mission.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; You see, it was it was um through
[1:12:44] throughout the Old Testament, you see
[1:12:46] the spirit of God came up on the people.
[1:12:50] You see, for service or for prophecy as
[1:12:53] the spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon
[1:12:55] found in Jud Judges, the spirit of the
[1:12:57] Lord came mightily upon Samson again in
[1:13:00] Judges. The spirit came came of the Lord
[1:13:02] came upon Saul in 1 Samuel. Now these
[1:13:06] experiences empowered people
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; for God's work but did not constitute a
[1:13:12] new birth.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; You see, as that would not be given
[1:13:17] until Pentecost.
[1:13:19] Now, so as we look at this, before the
[1:13:22] cross, the spirit could visit, it could
[1:13:26] empower and it could feel temporarily or
[1:13:29] rest upon someone for a task. But after
[1:13:32] the cross, after the resurrection, the
[1:13:35] spirit indwells permanently as the new
[1:13:38] birth, Christ living in the believer.
[1:13:43] And and of course Ezekiel would prophesy
[1:13:45] this and he would say um he would say um
[1:13:49] about the new covenant coming, I will
[1:13:52] put my spirit in you and cause you to
[1:13:55] walk in my statutes.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; So we see it would be the spirit of God
[1:13:59] that would empower men and women to obey
[1:14:02] the word of God. Without the Holy Ghost
[1:14:05] empowering you, you cannot live the
[1:14:07] Christian life.
[1:14:11] So now as we look at this, I want to
[1:14:13] just point out John the Baptist prenatal
[1:14:15] filling was real,
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; but it was pre-Calvary
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; and therefore not a permanent indwelling
[1:14:23] of the spirit as given in the new
[1:14:25] covenant. It was a prophetic
[1:14:28] empowerment.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as we as we look upon this, I
[1:14:36] want to get this what he said in Ezekiel
[1:14:39] because this within you. I will put my
[1:14:43] spirit within you. Not upon you,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; but within you. This is the new covenant
[1:14:50] as prophesied. And it it would be the
[1:14:52] spirit changing the nature and now
[1:14:55] permanently in dwelling.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Now, but that awaited Jesus
[1:15:00] glorification. You see, even the
[1:15:03] disciples walked with Jesus and
[1:15:05] performed miracles, but did not receive
[1:15:08] the undwelling spirit until Pentecost.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so if we even look at Christ,
[1:15:17] the Lord Jesus as our pattern, we we
[1:15:20] find that Jesus though he was conceived
[1:15:23] of the Holy Ghost, he did not minister
[1:15:25] publicly until the spirit descending on
[1:15:29] him at his baptism. and and anointed him
[1:15:32] for service and then indwelled him.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Right? So, as we said, John the Baptist
[1:15:39] was filled with the spirit in his
[1:15:40] mother's womb as a as a special uh
[1:15:45] specific prophetic empowerment that
[1:15:48] prepared him to be the forerunner of
[1:15:51] Jesus Christ. But the new birth by the
[1:15:54] indwelling of the spirit, the permanent
[1:15:56] life of Christ within could not come
[1:15:59] until anyone until Jesus blood was shed
[1:16:03] to atone for sin and and was glorified.
[1:16:07] And so after Calvary and Pentecost, the
[1:16:10] spirit coming became not just a
[1:16:13] visitation
[1:16:14] that would come and go and Moses would
[1:16:17] be anointed and then the anointing would
[1:16:20] leave and then Moses would would again,
[1:16:23] you know, would would fail the Lord
[1:16:25] because he would exalt himself and David
[1:16:28] would do the same. You know, all these
[1:16:30] things, you know, the anointing would
[1:16:32] come and go. But you you see at
[1:16:35] Pentecost it was not just a visitation
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; but the incarnation
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; of Christ in his people.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So John was filled with the
[1:16:49] spirit for his mission. Um but he could
[1:16:52] not be born again as they were at
[1:16:53] Pentecost. Now the spirit could visit
[1:16:56] before Calvary but after Calvary the
[1:16:59] spirit could inhabit.
[1:17:01] So before the cross, the Holy Spirit
[1:17:04] clothed men for servant for service. And
[1:17:07] after the cross, the spirit indwells men
[1:17:12] for sunship.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; And there's a difference.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; You see, the spirit could not be poured
[1:17:18] out before Jesus was glorified because
[1:17:21] that spirit was the very life of the
[1:17:24] glorified Christ.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Sin had to be dealt with.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Death had to be conquered. Christ had to
[1:17:31] be enthroned before his life could be
[1:17:34] imparted to his people. And once
[1:17:36] glorified, he sent the Holy Spirit to
[1:17:39] come in and dwell his body, not to be
[1:17:42] just with them now,
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; but in them.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Now, so Calvary opened the fountain. The
[1:17:49] resurrection raised the power. Pentecost
[1:17:51] poured it out. And the Holy Ghost we
[1:17:54] receive today is the glorified Christ
[1:17:57] living in his people. Ain't that
[1:18:00] wonderful?
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So at Pentecost, the spirit of God
[1:18:04] descended. Let's read about it. And when
[1:18:06] the day of Pentecost was fully come,
[1:18:09] there they were all with one accord in
[1:18:12] one place. And suddenly there came a
[1:18:14] sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[1:18:17] wind. And it filled all the house where
[1:18:20] they were sitting. And there appeared
[1:18:22] unto them cloven tongues like as of
[1:18:24] fire, and it sat upon each one of them.
[1:18:27] And they were all filled with the Holy
[1:18:29] Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:18:31] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:18:33] utterance. Now when they heard this,
[1:18:36] they were pricricked in their hearts and
[1:18:39] they said, "What shall we men and
[1:18:43] brethren? What shall we do?" This is
[1:18:45] what they asked Peter. And Peter says
[1:18:48] what? He gives the eternal prescription.
[1:18:51] He says, "Repent
[1:18:54] and be baptized, every one of you
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:19:00] remission of sins, and you shall receive
[1:19:04] the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Now, this promise will go how long?
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; It'll be to you.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; It'll be to your children.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; It'll be for them that are far off. As
[1:19:15] long as the gospel goes to all the
[1:19:18] world. Amen. This will be the divine
[1:19:23] vaccine,
[1:19:24] the inoculation against sin. This will
[1:19:28] be the eternal prescription. This is
[1:19:30] what will be required to go in the
[1:19:33] rapture.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Will be this eternal prescription.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; No one can go without it.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] Now, as we look at this here, I want
[1:19:48] just to think of this because this
[1:19:51] remained unchanged in brother Brandham's
[1:19:54] teaching. Brother Brandham emphatically
[1:19:57] taught that the Holy Ghost was an
[1:19:59] experience you receive. is not mere a
[1:20:02] mere confession of faith of I believe
[1:20:05] the message or I I receive its truth or
[1:20:09] I agree I concur with its doctrines or I
[1:20:13] have this revelation
[1:20:15] and to do this he will use Moses as an
[1:20:19] example. And he said Moses, you know,
[1:20:21] was called of God a prophet. And while
[1:20:24] he was called being a prophet, he had to
[1:20:27] have a supernatural experience in order
[1:20:29] to be a prophet. He had to meet God face
[1:20:32] to face and talk with him. And another
[1:20:34] thing, what he had said had to come to
[1:20:36] pass or no one would have believed him.
[1:20:38] So no man has a right to call himself
[1:20:41] thus until he's talked face to face with
[1:20:44] God on the backside of a desert
[1:20:46] somewhere where he met God himself. And
[1:20:50] all the atheists in the world could not
[1:20:52] explain it away from him. He was there.
[1:20:55] He knew it happened. Every Christian
[1:20:59] should have that experience before they
[1:21:01] say anything about being a Christian.
[1:21:04] Your own experience.
[1:21:07] So, Brother Brandham taught us over and
[1:21:09] over and over, he said, even in question
[1:21:11] answer 64, yeah, you, you know, you've
[1:21:14] got to have the lighting of the candle.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; The fire has to come and ignite.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he even talks to his nephew.
[1:21:23] Now, watch this because here you're
[1:21:26] talking to a relative here. Here you're
[1:21:28] talking to your kin folks. You think
[1:21:29] he's going to mislead his kin folks?
[1:21:33] So he says, "I'm talking to my nephew. A
[1:21:36] little while ago, a little Catholic boy
[1:21:38] said, "Uncle Bill, I've run from pillar
[1:21:40] to post, going everywhere, trying to
[1:21:41] find something night after night."
[1:21:44] And he says, "Before this meeting
[1:21:46] started, he's been crying every night
[1:21:48] time. He's been dreaming of dreams,
[1:21:49] coming in, running up the altar. We're
[1:21:51] preaching and making confession that
[1:21:53] he's been wrong." And I said, Melvin, no
[1:21:56] matter where you try to go, how many
[1:22:00] churches you join, how many hail Marys
[1:22:04] you say, cuz he's a Catholic boy, how
[1:22:07] many blessings you get from men, you
[1:22:10] see, you've got to be born again of the
[1:22:12] spirit of God. It's the only thing that
[1:22:14] has satisfy the human heart.
[1:22:18] Now then he says, "Now I know they got a
[1:22:22] substitute today for being born again."
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Remember we went through the substitute
[1:22:30] last week, a substitute like in the Old
[1:22:33] Testament, a substitute lamb till the
[1:22:35] real lamb came.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; You see uh a substitute atonement for
[1:22:40] sin that would not take away sin but
[1:22:42] would only cover it till the redeemer
[1:22:44] came.
[1:22:45] So again, a substitute. What we got down
[1:22:49] to the dark ages was a substitute for
[1:22:52] new birth. What we got even with with
[1:22:55] that justification and sanctification
[1:22:57] was also substitute. Even a soua street
[1:23:01] was a substitute. It was the anointing
[1:23:05] of the spirit coming down. And and the
[1:23:09] token only came back at evening time. So
[1:23:13] that's how I know they got a substitute
[1:23:16] today of being born again. Just shake
[1:23:18] hands with the preacher, put your name
[1:23:20] on the book. But friends, that's a
[1:23:22] dogma.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; It's not a Bible truth. It would the
[1:23:25] Acts of the Apostle in the second
[1:23:27] chapter would read like this. When the
[1:23:29] day of Pentecost was fully come, the
[1:23:31] pastor walked out and shook hands with
[1:23:32] the people. But it said when the day of
[1:23:35] Pentecost was fully come at the
[1:23:36] inauguration of the church, there came a
[1:23:38] sound from heaven like a rushing mighty
[1:23:41] wind and it filled all the house where
[1:23:43] they were sitting. That's how the Holy
[1:23:45] Spirit come the first time. That's how
[1:23:48] it come every time since that time. He's
[1:23:51] God and he changes not. Now it stumbles
[1:23:54] people and they say that was for another
[1:23:57] day.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandon said he's the same
[1:24:01] yesterday, today, and forever. Every
[1:24:03] time the church ever received the Holy
[1:24:06] Ghost, it's always come like he did the
[1:24:09] first time under the same prescription.
[1:24:13] Acts 2:38 has never changed. Never will
[1:24:18] change.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that?
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Never will change. Watch now. Then he
[1:24:27] says it's like a doctor's prescription
[1:24:30] for disease. He'll write out a
[1:24:33] prescription for the disease the doctor
[1:24:36] does and it has to have as and take it
[1:24:40] as something quite drugous and he puts
[1:24:43] too much of the antidote in it. It it's
[1:24:45] it's too weak and it won't do you any
[1:24:47] good and if he puts too much of the
[1:24:50] poison it'll kill you. It's got to be
[1:24:53] wrote just according to the doctor. And
[1:24:56] the doctor's prescription on how to
[1:24:59] receive the Holy Ghost is given by Dr.
[1:25:02] Simon Peter on the day of Pentecost.
[1:25:04] I'll give you a prescription. Repent
[1:25:07] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:25:10] name of Jesus Christ for remission of
[1:25:12] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:25:14] the Holy Ghost. For the prescription is
[1:25:17] to them that is far off, even as many as
[1:25:20] the Lord our God shall call the eternal
[1:25:23] prescription.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Now, this of course is what the prophet
[1:25:29] laid down for us. And and he says as he
[1:25:33] preaches the church aces and here he's
[1:25:36] standing there now as the messenger to
[1:25:39] Leodysia. And he's and he's revealing
[1:25:42] now all of the ages and their messengers
[1:25:45] and their message. And he stands there
[1:25:48] as that messenger. He says, "Oh God,
[1:25:50] cleanse my hands. Cleanse my heart.
[1:25:52] Lord, if it takes every friend I got,
[1:25:55] let me give the prescription the way the
[1:25:59] doctor said."
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you've got so many
[1:26:04] dead churches
[1:26:06] and so many dead members. You're adding
[1:26:09] antidote and taking away so much of it
[1:26:12] until the prescription it ain't itself
[1:26:15] at all it won't heal nothing.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Now church this is a problem.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You know people are well we got the Holy
[1:26:23] Ghost but it didn't heal me of porn. It
[1:26:26] didn't heal me adultery. It didn't heal
[1:26:28] me of fornication. It didn't heal me of
[1:26:31] drugs. I I still you know have this
[1:26:34] habit. I I still You see, it don't heal
[1:26:37] nothing.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; You see why? Because
[1:26:42] there's not enough in it.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to deal with this
[1:26:47] because you may have confession and you
[1:26:50] may even have faith in it and you may
[1:26:53] you may even got water baptized, but
[1:26:56] unless you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; there is not enough in it.
[1:27:03] Come on.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says shaking hands, joining
[1:27:10] churches, sprinkling. Oh, mercy. That's
[1:27:13] not the prescription. That's death. If
[1:27:15] you want life and you want the Holy
[1:27:18] Ghost, follow what God said do. Take the
[1:27:21] prescription.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; That's exactly the way he said do. Don't
[1:27:25] add to it. Don't take away from it. Then
[1:27:27] over here you come over in revelation
[1:27:28] right here over said whoever will take
[1:27:31] away or add to the same will be taken
[1:27:35] his part out of the book of life.
[1:27:38] Amen. Now
[1:27:41] brother Brandham preaches a sermon over
[1:27:43] and over again just for your
[1:27:46] information.
[1:27:48] Four times he preaches the bomb in
[1:27:50] Gilead asking from Jeremiah is there no
[1:27:54] bomb? Is there no healing in Gilead?
[1:27:59] Is there no physician there?
[1:28:02] Are there those not preaching the word?
[1:28:05] Well, then why is it that the health of
[1:28:08] the daughter of my people recovered?
[1:28:12] So he preaches
[1:28:15] four times on Bal and Gilead. Eight
[1:28:17] times he preaches from the same
[1:28:19] scriptures entitles it. Why? And he's
[1:28:22] continues stressing this even after the
[1:28:26] seals he will preach on it. Now I listen
[1:28:30] church. Today we have a new breed of
[1:28:33] ministers and they are the rickies that
[1:28:36] follow every movement.
[1:28:39] fallen angels
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; who get into it who who absolutely will
[1:28:45] bring in nickelanism as we brought it
[1:28:48] down to conquer the ley to make it where
[1:28:51] you don't receive the spirit
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; and and this new breed of ministers are
[1:28:58] preaching about the Holy Ghost and
[1:28:59] sexuality
[1:29:01] saying that the Acts two experience is
[1:29:03] not valid today and that it won't remedy
[1:29:07] the the sex problem among our youth. You
[1:29:10] know, they're they're stressing the use
[1:29:11] of psychology and lessons to solve the
[1:29:14] problem of of sinful sexual vice, but
[1:29:18] and they boldly will even put on their
[1:29:20] brochures for the youth meetings that
[1:29:22] the Holy Ghost will not fix the problem
[1:29:25] that our young people are facing.
[1:29:30] Now,
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not making that up,
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; but I want to say we've got a bomb in
[1:29:36] Gilead.
[1:29:38] And we got physicians
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; who still preach the word,
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; but people refuse to take it.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; And God's asking why didn't you? And at
[1:29:51] the day of judgment, he's going to be
[1:29:53] asking why.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we have a whole bunch
[1:30:00] that look at their pastors over in the
[1:30:02] tribulation and said, "Why didn't you?"
[1:30:06] How come you tempered with the
[1:30:08] prescriptions?
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Look at where we are now.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; And God asked, "Why?
[1:30:18] I provided the bomb.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I sent a message.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; I sent the token.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; It is here. Why didn't you take it?"
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Now, so brother Brandham even this and
[1:30:31] let me just read some excerpts from it.
[1:30:33] He said, "We got a bomb in Gilead. We
[1:30:36] got physicians, but the people is
[1:30:38] refusing to take it." And God's going to
[1:30:40] ask you, "Why? Why didn't you at the day
[1:30:41] of judgment? Is there no bomb in
[1:30:44] Gilead?" Sure. Is there no physicians
[1:30:46] there? Certainly. That's right. Then why
[1:30:50] is my people so sickish? Hallelujah. You
[1:30:53] know what's the matter? You get a real
[1:30:55] doctor to write out a prescription. You
[1:30:57] take it down to some quack drugist. and
[1:31:00] he goes to mention that prescription
[1:31:02] with something else. He will kill the
[1:31:05] patient.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; I just want to say the prophet of God
[1:31:09] wrote out the prescription just like
[1:31:12] Peter did. Amen.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; But then you get it in the hands of
[1:31:17] these drugist
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; and they'll mix this and that and the
[1:31:22] other and psychology and
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; formulas of men and nine steps to to
[1:31:30] overcoming and all kinds of junk
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; and preservatives that kill.
[1:31:40] Now, you know, I don't know if I put any
[1:31:43] of them. No, so let me just keep it on
[1:31:45] that. So, it has to be, as I say,
[1:31:49] brother Brandham said, it has to be a
[1:31:51] balanced prescription.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And God, the doctor noted how to give it
[1:31:56] to Simon Peter and he wrote and he said,
[1:31:59] "This prescription is for you, your
[1:32:00] children, to them that are far off." He
[1:32:03] says again, when a doctor finds a remedy
[1:32:05] for a disease and he writes a
[1:32:07] prescription and some quack drugist gets
[1:32:09] a hold and goes to adding a little of
[1:32:11] this and taking a little of this out,
[1:32:13] he'll either kill the patient or do
[1:32:15] something to it. The prescription
[1:32:17] doesn't even have enough medicine in it
[1:32:20] to do it any good. And if it don't, it's
[1:32:23] so weak, you won't help the patient.
[1:32:25] That's right.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And that's what's the matter with a lot
[1:32:29] of these seminary drugs today. They take
[1:32:32] the prescription out and add something
[1:32:34] else in and you got a bunch of dying
[1:32:37] morgs.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just tell you because you
[1:32:43] know it's all out. It's everywhere. I
[1:32:47] hear preaching. I hear preaching now
[1:32:49] that the Jews received the Holy Ghost on
[1:32:51] the day of Pentecost
[1:32:54] and it came with power and
[1:32:55] demonstrations. But for the Gentiles, it
[1:32:58] came upon the household of Cornelius and
[1:33:01] and they received the Holy Ghost. It
[1:33:03] came differently to the Gentiles. We
[1:33:05] don't receive it like that. They just
[1:33:07] received it by receiving the word. I
[1:33:10] wish people would read their Bible
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; because the Bible did say that while
[1:33:15] Peter spoke these words, the Holy Ghost
[1:33:17] fell on them that believe.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But then it goes on to say how it
[1:33:23] was poured out. And and in Acts 10:46
[1:33:26] said, "For we know they got the Holy
[1:33:29] Ghost like we did,
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; for we heard them speak with tongues and
[1:33:32] magnify God."
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; So they didn't just get it and not know
[1:33:38] it.
[1:33:40] They didn't just get it by receiving a
[1:33:42] doctrine.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; There was an experience
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; that came with it.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Now, we're not preaching a certain
[1:33:52] experience of a jump or a shout or dance
[1:33:54] or or speaking in tongues or gift or
[1:33:57] what. I don't care what form it comes
[1:33:59] in,
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; just as long as it happens.
[1:34:05] And we will know whether or not it
[1:34:07] happened by the effect
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; because after taking the vaccine, if
[1:34:13] you're still doing sin,
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; we know you didn't take the
[1:34:19] prescription, right?
[1:34:25] So now, brother Brandham in the message,
[1:34:28] why this is
[1:34:31] one of the last ones he preaches. It's
[1:34:33] it's after the seals. This prescription
[1:34:37] still remains the same.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; When the Samaritans received it, they
[1:34:41] get inoculated. They had the same thing.
[1:34:44] When the Gentiles received it, they got
[1:34:46] the same prescription. So, let me tell
[1:34:48] you, no matter what they're teaching,
[1:34:50] the same prescription applies for Jews
[1:34:52] and Gentiles.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Paul met a bunch in Acts 19 who had
[1:34:59] part, somebody say part,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; part of the prescription, not all of it.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; And he said that won't work. You're
[1:35:10] going to kill the whole thing. So, he
[1:35:12] wrote it all over for them, told them
[1:35:13] how to get it. They got it the same way.
[1:35:15] And that's what's the matter today.
[1:35:17] There's plenty of bomb in Gilead and we
[1:35:20] got plenty of positions, but the people
[1:35:22] are afraid of the prescription. Glory.
[1:35:24] Praise be to God. Is there no bomb in
[1:35:26] Gilead? Is there no power of the Holy
[1:35:28] Ghost? Now, now is there this
[1:35:31] inoculation works on all? See, it did on
[1:35:34] the Jews. It did on the Samaritans. It
[1:35:36] did on the Gentiles. It does on
[1:35:38] everybody the same way.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. You know, it's not a
[1:35:44] temporary prescription.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; It's an eternal prescription.
[1:35:49] It doesn't work for Acts two. And we got
[1:35:52] something else today. It's an eternal
[1:35:54] prescription.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Now again,
[1:35:59] see this inoculation works. Brother
[1:36:02] Brandaman paradox. And this is a little
[1:36:04] quotation I want you to get. The pillar
[1:36:07] of fire is identified scientifically
[1:36:12] and by the reaction by its character in
[1:36:15] everything. How many believes this age
[1:36:17] has been visited by the pillar of fire
[1:36:19] again?
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; And as it was when it was dwelling in
[1:36:25] the body of God's only begotten son, so
[1:36:29] does it dwell in the body of his adopted
[1:36:33] sons
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; for the last day. That's right.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; So what you are seeing in Acts two of
[1:36:40] the Holy Ghost descending the pillar of
[1:36:43] fire and dividing itself, every one of
[1:36:47] you can have it.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; And that's what you have.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm going to look back at the
[1:36:56] Reformation and and review how the new
[1:36:59] birth was restored in stages. Because in
[1:37:03] the early reformation, the new birth was
[1:37:05] not in its fullness as it was as
[1:37:07] Pentecost. But yet with each portion of
[1:37:11] truth that was revealed came a portion
[1:37:14] of the spirit.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And the portion of the word given came
[1:37:20] with a portion of the spirit in every
[1:37:22] age. So the new birth corresponds
[1:37:26] to the revealed word in each age.
[1:37:31] Are you with me?
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Those who received the new birth
[1:37:36] in Luther's age received the Holy Ghost
[1:37:40] that justified them.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; They accepted, they obeyed, they aligned
[1:37:45] with the word and it was re as it was
[1:37:47] revealed for that particular time. And
[1:37:50] the spirit is the word and whatever
[1:37:53] manifestation of the word comes in your
[1:37:56] age that is Jesus to your age. That's
[1:38:00] right.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; So you don't, well, I'm going to leave
[1:38:02] the message and find Jesus. No, the
[1:38:04] message. Only through the message can
[1:38:08] you find Jesus.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; You might find where he was and the
[1:38:13] fragrance of where he was in a past
[1:38:16] revival, but he's not there.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Now, as we go into this, let's just go
[1:38:23] back to medieval Catholic understanding.
[1:38:26] You know, originally everybody knew the
[1:38:28] new birth, the Holy Ghost came on the
[1:38:31] day of Pentecost. This is what you had
[1:38:33] to do.
[1:38:35] But before Luther in the middle ages,
[1:38:37] the Roman Catholic Church taught the new
[1:38:39] birth was essentially tied to
[1:38:42] sacraments. So baptism, they believed
[1:38:45] infant baptism washed away the original
[1:38:48] sin and regenerated the child and that
[1:38:50] was considered the moment of the new
[1:38:52] birth. So if you were born in a Catholic
[1:38:55] family, you were taken and Christian or
[1:38:57] Christ put in you by the Holy Ghost, you
[1:39:00] know, there by baptism and you were
[1:39:02] regenerated when the water was sprinkled
[1:39:06] on you.
[1:39:08] And then and then uh of course penance
[1:39:11] and confession. If one sinned after
[1:39:13] baptism, penance, confession, acts of
[1:39:16] contrition, prayers, rosaries,
[1:39:18] pilgrimages, indulgences, that was a way
[1:39:21] to restore grace.
[1:39:24] And then finally you know they would
[1:39:26] have the eukarist which is mass which is
[1:39:29] receiving communion which was believed
[1:39:32] to impart Christ's life continually. So
[1:39:35] you go to mass every day because you
[1:39:37] need Jesus every day needed to be supply
[1:39:40] of him.
[1:39:42] So the new birth is viewed was viewed as
[1:39:46] church administered grace imparted by
[1:39:50] ritual maintained through sacraments not
[1:39:54] as a personal faith-based experience of
[1:39:57] Christ. So you could not receive it now
[1:39:59] and this is of course why the Catholics
[1:40:02] go to mass every day is because it is
[1:40:05] here the life of Christ is administered
[1:40:07] by the priest daily.
[1:40:10] So you see this was conquering the ley
[1:40:12] you had to get it from the priest
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; from the clergy. Now contact with the
[1:40:17] church and the priest was needed and for
[1:40:19] them it's a daily renewal. So here they
[1:40:23] go to get renewed every day by going to
[1:40:24] mass. Stick out your tongue get the way
[1:40:26] for the the the priest gets the wine and
[1:40:29] and until he becomes a drunken s
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; he staggers out drunk
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; because he got too much of the spirit.
[1:40:40] Now,
[1:40:42] why and how? Because they believe the
[1:40:46] priest can change the bread into the
[1:40:48] literal body and blood of the Lord.
[1:40:52] Somebody reminded me, but I read the the
[1:40:54] book of Charles Quinn Chinnquy
[1:40:57] on uh 50 years in the church of Rome.
[1:40:59] How many's read it? Well, that's a good
[1:41:02] number. It's a it's a great read. Read
[1:41:04] it.
[1:41:06] But anyway, Charles Chenquay, he he he
[1:41:10] reported of how that they had a blind
[1:41:12] priest one day that was doing the
[1:41:16] sacrament.
[1:41:19] And you know, as they were as he was
[1:41:21] praying over and changed the bread into
[1:41:24] the literal body and him being blind, a
[1:41:27] rat came in and stole the body.
[1:41:33] And so they went to looking for it and
[1:41:35] discovered a rat had stolen the body of
[1:41:38] Jesus Christ. And this poor priest
[1:41:41] leaned over and wept bitterly saying,
[1:41:43] "Oh God, what will I do? The rats have
[1:41:46] eaten the precious body of my Lord."
[1:41:53] Now you say, "Brother Tim, that's
[1:41:54] ridiculous." Well, it is.
[1:41:58] You cannot change bread into the literal
[1:42:02] body of Christ. It is symbolic
[1:42:04] representing.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; And that's not how you receive Christ.
[1:42:10] You receive Christ by a new birth by the
[1:42:13] indwelling of the spirit.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; So the new birth and receiving Christ
[1:42:17] was now just a church administered
[1:42:20] grace. And then of course there was the
[1:42:23] emphasis on works because of this
[1:42:26] sacramental view. Salvation was thought
[1:42:28] of as a lifelong process of earning and
[1:42:32] keeping grace.
[1:42:38] Somehow we got to do something to merit
[1:42:41] sunship.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; That's what they thought.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; You were born again as an infant in
[1:42:48] baptism. You maintained it by obedience
[1:42:51] to the church, uh, penance, prayers, and
[1:42:54] indulgence in good works. Assurance of
[1:42:57] salvation was considered presumptuous.
[1:43:01] Nobody could be certain they were saved.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; So even after all of this,
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; you couldn't be sure of salvation.
[1:43:14] So thus the new birth was not a
[1:43:16] conscious spirit rock transformation but
[1:43:19] a status conferred by the church.
[1:43:22] Hence while you after you died just in
[1:43:25] case you were sinned and which you did
[1:43:28] because you're all sinners and you can
[1:43:30] never overcome. So therefore you know
[1:43:33] you appear before God as a sinner. So
[1:43:36] you're in purgatory, a place of waiting
[1:43:38] until enough prayers are prayed and
[1:43:40] money is given by your loved ones to
[1:43:43] pray you out of purgatory so you can
[1:43:45] finally find rest for your soul. Until
[1:43:49] then, you are a tormented being. So for
[1:43:52] all of you that lost loved ones, divy
[1:43:55] up.
[1:44:02] And now my prayers, if your prayers
[1:44:04] wouldn't save me before I died, how are
[1:44:07] they going to save me after I'm dead?
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; So you you see again th this was a
[1:44:15] condition. This no wonder we call this
[1:44:17] the dark ages.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; People believe this
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; sincerely.
[1:44:27] Now, so before Luther, the the birth was
[1:44:31] sacramental regeneration, especially
[1:44:34] infant baptism and salvation was not an
[1:44:37] experience, but a process of works,
[1:44:39] penance, obedience to the church.
[1:44:41] Assurance was impossible. In fact, they
[1:44:45] considered it arrogance.
[1:44:49] You're really arrogant to think you're
[1:44:51] saved now. Nobody's saved now.
[1:44:57] So you see by the time of Luther and the
[1:44:59] Reformation, Luther knew that although
[1:45:02] he was born to church and he'd done
[1:45:04] penance and said rosaries and burnt
[1:45:06] candles and he was still unconverted,
[1:45:10] unchanged. And he hungered for a
[1:45:12] relationship with the living God. Not as
[1:45:16] a rel religious ritual. He had that not
[1:45:20] something coming from a ritual from an
[1:45:23] unholy priesthood who was sinful living
[1:45:27] double lives and every kind of other
[1:45:29] thing but by the time of Luther the
[1:45:32] truth of the new birth the spirit's
[1:45:34] undwelling it had to be administered by
[1:45:38] a priest
[1:45:40] now this is where brother Brandham talks
[1:45:42] about the doctrine of the nickelans
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; you could not have the experience of
[1:45:48] acts two nobody could have a personal
[1:45:50] experience it had been reduced to
[1:45:54] rituals and sacraments now let's hurry
[1:45:58] Martin Luther's early life and religion
[1:46:01] he was born in 1483
[1:46:04] inbin Germany he grew up in a strict
[1:46:07] Catholic household his father wanted to
[1:46:09] be a lawyer and in 1505 during a
[1:46:12] thunderstorm he vowed to St. an help me
[1:46:15] and I'll become a monk. He kept that vow
[1:46:18] and he entered an Augustine monastery.
[1:46:22] Now he's doing what he can to work his
[1:46:24] way to heaven to find salvation.
[1:46:27] And he pursued salvation by the only
[1:46:30] path that he knew works. He fasted long
[1:46:34] hours. He prayed long hours. He
[1:46:38] confessed constantly. He said the
[1:46:40] rosaries. He did penance. Listen, they
[1:46:43] them people are so sincere. They'll
[1:46:45] they'll crawl on their hands and knees
[1:46:47] until they're bloody,
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Nail themselves to a cross doing
[1:46:52] penance, all kinds of things, physically
[1:46:56] whipping himself.
[1:46:58] And yet he later admitted though I lived
[1:47:02] as a monk without reproach. I felt that
[1:47:06] I was a sinner before God and I had an
[1:47:09] extremely disturbed conscience. I could
[1:47:12] not believe that he was placated by my
[1:47:15] sat satisfaction and he realized that
[1:47:17] all his religion left him unconverted
[1:47:19] and without peace.
[1:47:22] So this was Luther
[1:47:24] and he and until he comes to the tower
[1:47:27] experience and we'll talk about that in
[1:47:29] a moment. But until then he lives up
[1:47:32] under the torment of a guilty
[1:47:34] conscience. He feared the righteousness
[1:47:38] of God as an avenging justice. God's out
[1:47:42] to get me. He wants to kill me. A holy
[1:47:44] judge ready to con condemn me for the
[1:47:47] least thing I do wrong. And he said, "I
[1:47:50] did not love." Yes, I hated the
[1:47:54] righteous God who punishes sinners
[1:47:59] because I can't do right. I can't
[1:48:02] satisfy your justice.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; And all you want to do is punish me and
[1:48:08] cast me into hell. And nothing I can do,
[1:48:11] all the works I've done doesn't make me
[1:48:15] right before God. And though he had been
[1:48:18] born into the church and baptized and
[1:48:21] was zealous, he had no assurance of
[1:48:23] forgiveness.
[1:48:26] You know, Romans 1:17,
[1:48:28] it tormented him. The just shall live by
[1:48:30] faith. You know, the righteousness of
[1:48:33] God is revealed from faith to faith is
[1:48:35] written that just shall live by faith.
[1:48:37] And this scripture tormented him. So
[1:48:40] sometimes around 1519 while he was
[1:48:42] studying in the monastery in Wittenberg
[1:48:44] light finally broke through and Luther
[1:48:46] later wrote at last by the mercy of God
[1:48:50] meditating day and night I gave heed to
[1:48:52] the context of the word the just shall
[1:48:54] live by faith and then I began to
[1:48:57] understand the righteousness of God is
[1:49:00] that which is the righteous li lives by
[1:49:04] a gift of God namely by faith. And this
[1:49:07] is the meaning the righteousness of God
[1:49:09] is revealed by the gospel. Namely the
[1:49:11] passive righteousness which which
[1:49:14] merciful God justifies us by faith. And
[1:49:18] here I felt I was altogether born again.
[1:49:22] And it entered paradise itself through
[1:49:25] the open gate. And this was Luther's
[1:49:27] conversion. He discovered that
[1:49:29] justification is not earned.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Righteousness is not something you do.
[1:49:36] It's it's imputed to you.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Received by faith in Christ.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; So now this was Luther's conversion.
[1:49:50] And he believed now based on this
[1:49:52] experience that he was born again. Now
[1:49:55] born again, I want you to catch this
[1:49:59] takes on a new term.
[1:50:03] It no longer is works related and
[1:50:06] rituals related to the church, but it's
[1:50:10] when you believe
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; that you are born again.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; So I want you to get it here. Now comes
[1:50:19] a new term. Justification
[1:50:22] becomes the new term or the new meaning
[1:50:25] of new birth. Now originally it meant
[1:50:28] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; as on the day of Pentecost.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Then it became reduced down in the dark
[1:50:35] ages in the medieval understanding to
[1:50:39] something imparted by the church.
[1:50:41] And then Luther comes along and gets a
[1:50:44] revelation that it's it's righteousness
[1:50:48] imputed to you by God through faith. And
[1:50:52] so the just, the righteous shall live by
[1:50:55] faith. So here he here again, the new
[1:51:00] birth takes on a new meaning.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Now it's not the meaning that they had
[1:51:08] on the day of Pentecost.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; But it's an improvement over Rome.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; It's a step closer to the truth.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; And fact of the matter is it is part
[1:51:22] It is part of the formula
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; but not all.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Now, so here was the scriptural
[1:51:30] foundation. The just shall live by
[1:51:32] faith. Romans 3:28 says, "Therefore, we
[1:51:35] conclude that a man is justified by
[1:51:37] faith without the deeds of the law." So
[1:51:40] he said, "Without all these works, I'm
[1:51:42] justified. I don't have to do anything
[1:51:44] to do it. My faith justifies me by
[1:51:47] believing what Jesus did for me."
[1:51:50] Ephesians 2:8-9, for by grace you are
[1:51:53] saved through faith that not yourself.
[1:51:55] It's a gift of God, not of works, lest
[1:51:57] any man should boast. So it isn't how
[1:51:59] many rosaries I said, how much I climbed
[1:52:01] on my knees, how many times I whipped
[1:52:04] myself, it's grace.
[1:52:07] Now these verses became the foundation
[1:52:11] cry of the reformation
[1:52:14] and it became the the the the
[1:52:18] very crux of of Luther's preaching and
[1:52:23] just as the birth is water, blood and
[1:52:25] spirit and it takes three to make a new
[1:52:27] birth even so justification
[1:52:30] believing on the Lord believing on his
[1:52:32] word believe in the gospel message is
[1:52:35] the First step
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; to the new birth.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; You must believe.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; He that cometh to God must believe.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So faith is the first step of the
[1:52:55] new birth.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Now as he said without faith is
[1:53:01] impossible to please God. He that cometh
[1:53:04] to God must believe that he is and that
[1:53:07] he'll reward those that diligently seek
[1:53:09] him. This was the truth. I want to say
[1:53:13] that this was the truth,
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; but it was partial truth.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, go back to Moses Lamb. It was
[1:53:24] the truth
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; and the way of salvation for that time,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; but it was a partial word. that would
[1:53:33] give way to the fullness of the word. It
[1:53:35] would be a lamb, but it wouldn't be a
[1:53:37] woolly lamb.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be an animal. It would be
[1:53:40] God himself.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So, this now is
[1:53:46] something that will work until the new
[1:53:49] the fullness comes. But it's not all
[1:53:52] been restored yet. And we need it
[1:53:54] restored completely for rapture.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:54:00] this was the truth. So among early
[1:54:03] believers from Pentecost onward,
[1:54:05] everybody, everyone understood that the
[1:54:08] Holy Ghost came subsequent after
[1:54:10] believing that faith was the first
[1:54:13] works. You must believe and you must
[1:54:16] repent. You must be cleansed. But after
[1:54:18] that, you must receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:20] It was an option. It was a requirement
[1:54:24] for salvation. And this is where I want
[1:54:27] to say this. This is where millions of
[1:54:30] Christians, even some in the message are
[1:54:32] stuck in the mud
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; and remain today. They believe and
[1:54:36] confess and yet go no further and many
[1:54:39] times not even the sanctification
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; and faith is only the beginnings of
[1:54:48] salvation.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Now I want to just drive this home here.
[1:54:53] I'm going to talk about it. And let's
[1:54:55] just go to a scripture that is the
[1:54:57] favorite among most of the reformers
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; and and the evangelical churches. And it
[1:55:06] is a wonderful scripture.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; When I say it's their favorite, it ought
[1:55:10] to be ours, too.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; That if the thou confess with thy mouth,
[1:55:15] thy mouth, the Lord Jesus, and shall
[1:55:18] believe in thine heart that God has
[1:55:20] raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
[1:55:22] saved. For with a heart man believeth
[1:55:25] unto righteousness, and with the mouth
[1:55:27] confession is made unto salvation.
[1:55:32] So let's get it clear. Faith is the
[1:55:35] beginnings of salvation.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; It is the doorway.
[1:55:41] Every birth begins with a conception.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Until you're conceived, you can't be
[1:55:47] born.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; So it begins with a conception. And when
[1:55:51] you believe from the heart and you
[1:55:53] confess Christ has risen from the dead
[1:55:56] and you receive him as your savior, you
[1:55:59] have taken a necessary step that is
[1:56:02] needed.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; If you hadn't done that, by all means do
[1:56:05] it.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; But that's not all of it.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; And John Wesley had this ex had this
[1:56:13] experience of the what was called the
[1:56:15] new birth. And and he knew there was
[1:56:19] more.
[1:56:22] He he realized,
[1:56:24] listen, it's got to be more than this.
[1:56:26] And confessing there's got to be your
[1:56:28] life and habits has got to be cleansed
[1:56:31] by the blood
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; and then filled with the spirit. And and
[1:56:35] of course, there's millions that make
[1:56:37] the mistake of stopping just being
[1:56:40] cleansed.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Now, Romans 10 shows the starting point.
[1:56:47] I'm going to drive this home,
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; which is faith and confession.
[1:56:52] As Paul said, if you confess with thy
[1:56:55] mouth, believe from your heart. So faith
[1:56:57] in Christ, resurrection and confessing
[1:57:00] him as Lord, that is essential.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:07] But conception is the beginning
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; of the new birth. Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; This is the seed of salvation planted in
[1:57:17] the heart. It is a conception of new
[1:57:20] life, not its full maturity.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Believe in the heart righteousness in
[1:57:27] the inward turning to God. Confession
[1:57:28] with the mouth and salvation. Outward
[1:57:31] acknowledgment of of Christ. And and of
[1:57:33] course in that you'll get baptized and
[1:57:35] and immersed in the name of Jesus. You
[1:57:37] know, whosoever therefore shall confess
[1:57:40] me before man, him will I confess for my
[1:57:43] father which is in heaven. So you can
[1:57:45] see right there that that this is
[1:57:48] important.
[1:57:49] Now Peter at Pentecost shows the next
[1:57:53] step and and of course you know here he
[1:57:57] shows um this very very clearly and I'm
[1:58:01] going to just go back here just for a
[1:58:03] moment um that he shows very clearly of
[1:58:06] repentance, baptism and and the Holy
[1:58:11] Ghost coming. And when the people at
[1:58:13] Pentecost
[1:58:15] asked, "What shall we do?
[1:58:20] What did Peter say?
[1:58:22] Well, just believe the message is right.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Just believe Jesus Christ is the son of
[1:58:31] God.
[1:58:32] Is that what he said?
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; No. He said repent,
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; be baptized
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ and you
[1:58:40] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:58:43] Ghost.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Now, so this is what he said. He didn't
[1:58:46] say confess Christ. He gave the full
[1:58:50] covenant pattern, the full prescription.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Now, so repentance is turning from sin.
[1:58:57] Baptism as identification with Christ's
[1:58:59] death, his burial, his resurrection,
[1:59:02] receiving the Holy Ghost is the new
[1:59:04] belief, the new birth completed where
[1:59:07] you are sealed to the day of redemption.
[1:59:10] Now, this is the same order that Jesus
[1:59:14] spoke of when he said, "Be born of the
[1:59:16] water and the spirit." Because it takes
[1:59:18] the cleansing first before you can be
[1:59:20] born of the spirit. Now, Paul shows this
[1:59:23] pattern elsewhere, and that's where I
[1:59:25] was going to here. He would show he, you
[1:59:28] know, th this was not his only teaching
[1:59:31] on the new birth.
[1:59:33] So, he teaches repentance in Acts 20:21.
[1:59:36] I both declared to both the Greeks, Jews
[1:59:38] and the Greeks that they must turn to
[1:59:40] God in repentance. So repent.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Then he taught baptism. Romans 6 and
[1:59:48] three. Oh, don't you know that all of us
[1:59:50] who were baptized into Christ were
[1:59:52] baptized into his death. We therefore
[1:59:53] buried with him in baptism into death in
[1:59:55] order that just as Christ was raised
[1:59:58] from the dead to the glory of the
[1:59:59] father, we too may receive a new life.
[2:00:02] So baptism.
[2:00:04] Then he taught receiving the spirit. He
[2:00:06] said you are not in the realm of the
[2:00:07] flesh but in the realm of the spirit. If
[2:00:09] if indeed the spirit of God lives in
[2:00:11] you. If anyone does not have the spirit
[2:00:13] of
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Christ. You reading with me?
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; They do not belong to Christ. But if
[2:00:20] Christ is in you, even though your body
[2:00:22] is subject to death because of sin, the
[2:00:25] spirit gives life because of
[2:00:26] righteousness. And if the spirit of him
[2:00:28] who raised up Jesus from the dead is
[2:00:31] living in you, he who raised Christ from
[2:00:33] the dead will also give life to your
[2:00:35] mortal bodies because of his spirit that
[2:00:38] lives in you.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; So Paul taught repentance, baptism, and
[2:00:46] receiving the spirit.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; He did not just teach confess with your
[2:00:51] mouth.
[2:00:54] So, you got to get all of what Paul
[2:00:56] taught. Now, he's not contradicting
[2:00:58] Peter because he makes that clear. You
[2:01:02] know, I I I and all of this, he's not
[2:01:06] saying, "Okay, Peter, I'm going I'm
[2:01:08] going to rewrite the prescription for
[2:01:09] you here." You know, you said it was
[2:01:11] repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:01:13] Christ, and for remission of sins, and
[2:01:15] you shall receive to get the Holy Ghost.
[2:01:16] I'm going to say just confess with your
[2:01:18] mouth, believe from your heart, and you
[2:01:20] got it.
[2:01:22] He didn't rewrite the prescription.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Read his writings.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Now again as we look salvation
[2:01:34] your conception is not the new birth.
[2:01:38] It's the starting point.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Now brother Brandham actually teaches
[2:01:42] this in question answer 64 if you want
[2:01:46] to read it thoroughly. And and so you
[2:01:49] see confession the Bible said is made
[2:01:53] under salvation
[2:01:55] meaning toward resulting in not already
[2:01:59] possessing.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; This shows believing and confessing it
[2:02:03] points you toward salvation's reality
[2:02:07] but it doesn't complete it. It's it's
[2:02:11] the difference between the conception
[2:02:13] and the birth. Faith and confession
[2:02:16] plants the seed. Obedience to the word
[2:02:19] and receiving the spirit brings the new
[2:02:23] life to full manifestation. That that's
[2:02:26] why brother Brandham said full obedience
[2:02:28] to the word entitles you to the token.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Well, what's he talking about, brother
[2:02:34] Jim? I got to be careful. Make sure I
[2:02:35] did everything right and crossed all the
[2:02:37] tees and and and dotted every eye and I
[2:02:40] I'm living perfectly and I I'm entitled.
[2:02:42] No. If you will be fully obedient to the
[2:02:45] word,
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; if you'll repent,
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; sincerely,
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; come with confession, washed by the
[2:02:53] water of the word,
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; cleansed by the blood.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody help me preach.
[2:02:59] Sanctified by the spirit, sir.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; If you will do this, you shall
[2:03:04] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[2:03:09] That's right.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:03:12] so baptism confesses the resurrection in
[2:03:16] action. It's in your life. Now, Paul
[2:03:19] teaches that baptism is a confession of
[2:03:22] Christ's resurrection, dying to the old
[2:03:24] self, buried with him, raised with him.
[2:03:28] And this, of course, is faith in motion.
[2:03:31] Is not just words on the lips, but is is
[2:03:34] a public confession.
[2:03:37] So you see believing and confessing are
[2:03:40] vital and no one can be saved without it
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; but they are steps to salvation not the
[2:03:47] totality of salvation
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; they prepare the heart for the washing
[2:03:52] of the water by the word you know the
[2:03:55] burial of baptism the infilling of the
[2:03:57] Holy Ghost and it was Peter's pattern at
[2:03:59] Pentecost that shows the completion of
[2:04:02] what Paul was outlining in Romans Amen.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; So faith plants the seed. Confession
[2:04:10] waters the seed. Baptism buries the old
[2:04:14] man, his sin and his past. The spirit
[2:04:17] raises up new life. So I'm going to tell
[2:04:19] you, don't stop at believing and
[2:04:22] confessing. Walk on into Christ until he
[2:04:25] fills you with his spirit.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Romans 10 opens the door. Acts
[2:04:30] two brings the spirit into the house.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now then, so John Wesley now he
[2:04:39] wrestles with the fact that he and other
[2:04:42] believers were not cleansed from sin,
[2:04:45] but they were continuing right on in sin
[2:04:48] even though they had believed.
[2:04:50] And millions make this mistake at
[2:04:52] stepping at this stopping at this first
[2:04:55] step. They believe Christ intellectually
[2:04:57] and perhaps even sincerely, but they
[2:04:59] never go on to full surrender
[2:05:02] and to full infilling. They remain in
[2:05:05] conception without a birth.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; And Jesus told Nicodemus, except a man
[2:05:12] be born of the water and the spirit, he
[2:05:14] cannot enter the kingdom of God. So it's
[2:05:17] not enough to believe about the spirit.
[2:05:19] You must receive the spirit. Not enough
[2:05:22] to believe the message. Say, "I believe
[2:05:24] the message, brother Brandham." That's
[2:05:25] only being able to read. You must have
[2:05:27] the token.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; It's not as to say Jesus Christ is Lord.
[2:05:32] Christ must take the throne of the
[2:05:34] heart.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; So again, to be born of the of the water
[2:05:39] and the spirit, where are we? Okay, so
[2:05:41] you know, we must be born again of the
[2:05:44] water in the spirit. And and and as we
[2:05:46] look at this, I want to go right on to
[2:05:48] Wesley now. Wesley testified to both
[2:05:51] justification and sanctification as
[2:05:54] experiences in his own life in Alders
[2:05:57] Alders Gate Street, May 24th, 1738.
[2:06:02] He felt his heart strangely warmed as he
[2:06:06] trusted in Christ alone for salvation.
[2:06:09] This was his assurance of forgiveness.
[2:06:12] This he believed was his new birth
[2:06:15] experience.
[2:06:17] Later experience of sanctification
[2:06:20] happened in 1761 at a watch night
[2:06:22] service
[2:06:24] and Wesley recorded that he experienced
[2:06:26] what he had long preached was entire
[2:06:30] sanctification. Now, they would call
[2:06:32] this the second blessing,
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; cuz you to them, they didn't argue that
[2:06:39] Luther was was born again when he was
[2:06:43] justified.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; But he just said, "You need a second
[2:06:47] blessing.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; You need sanctification." And so he
[2:06:51] wrote in his journal that I found
[2:06:54] witness of the spirit of God that he had
[2:06:57] taken away my sins and cleansed my heart
[2:06:59] from all unrighteousness. And after
[2:07:01] this, he was bolder in teaching that a
[2:07:04] believer could experience a second
[2:07:06] blessing here and now in this life, not
[2:07:09] just in heaven.
[2:07:12] And so he agreed with Luther that the
[2:07:15] sinner is pardoned and forgiven,
[2:07:16] declared righteous before God by faith
[2:07:18] and in Christ in Christ alone. And that
[2:07:21] this was the new birth. And the and what
[2:07:24] Wesley he would often call being born
[2:07:26] again, becoming a child of God. By
[2:07:28] justification, we are saved from the
[2:07:31] guilt of sin. By sanctification, we're
[2:07:33] saved from the power and the root and
[2:07:35] the root of sin. So he saw we needed a
[2:07:39] little more than just confession.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; We needed a cleansing.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; So he began to preach the second
[2:07:46] blessing, sanctification.
[2:07:49] So he taught that after conversion there
[2:07:52] often remained inbred sin
[2:07:56] or a carnal nature that still caused
[2:07:58] believers to struggle. And through the
[2:08:00] earnest seeking and consecration, a
[2:08:03] believer could experience an additional
[2:08:05] a distinct uh work of grace. And he
[2:08:09] called that entire sanctification or
[2:08:15] Christian perfection.
[2:08:18] And so this second blessing
[2:08:21] that he didn't think was a new birth
[2:08:22] itself, but a just a deeper cleansing of
[2:08:25] the heart and that it brought a freedom
[2:08:28] from the dominion of sin and and enabled
[2:08:30] a holy life and a and a love toward God
[2:08:33] and toward neighbor. And he thought the
[2:08:36] Lutheran were born again. to have
[2:08:37] justification, but they just stopped
[2:08:39] short of this second work of grace. And
[2:08:43] they they needed to go on to entire
[2:08:46] sanctification, be cleansed from the
[2:08:49] inward sin, and to be filled with
[2:08:51] perfect love.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; And so he would often say,
[2:08:55] "Justification is the porch, the new
[2:08:58] birth is the door, and sanctification is
[2:09:00] the house." This was all his preaching.
[2:09:03] But the truth of it was sanctification
[2:09:07] was not the indwelling of the spirit.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; It was only the preparation or the
[2:09:15] cleansing of the house
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; for the spirit to indwell.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:09:24] here's what he thought. He believed that
[2:09:27] the goal of the gospel was not just to
[2:09:29] pardon but to bring holiness.
[2:09:32] He taught from these scriptures, this is
[2:09:34] the will of God, even your
[2:09:36] sanctification. So God's will for you is
[2:09:38] a sanctified life. Hebrews 12:14, follow
[2:09:42] peace with all men and holiness without
[2:09:45] which no man shall see the Lord. No man
[2:09:47] is going to see God unless he gets
[2:09:49] holiness. He began to preach from
[2:09:51] Ephesians 5 that Christ gave himself
[2:09:54] that he might sanctify and cleanse it,
[2:09:56] that he might present himself a glorious
[2:09:58] church without spot or wrinkle. And he
[2:10:00] saw this as a second work of grace.
[2:10:04] It was an experience of cleansing that
[2:10:06] went beyond justification. And brother
[2:10:08] Brandham, of course, would agree with
[2:10:10] this. He said, "This is th this is th
[2:10:14] this is very important. You must be
[2:10:18] sanctified before you get the Holy
[2:10:20] Ghost."
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; And this is what he chastised the men
[2:10:25] all the way through 62. He was over and
[2:10:27] over again. He said they they're born
[2:10:29] again. In other words, they they have
[2:10:32] received um justification. They they
[2:10:35] believed by faith, but they're claiming
[2:10:37] to get the Holy Ghost and they're not
[2:10:39] even sanctified. Look at these women.
[2:10:40] They're still cutting their hair.
[2:10:41] They're still painting their face. Look
[2:10:43] at these men. They're still smoking.
[2:10:44] They're still drinking. All of these.
[2:10:46] And they're claiming, "I got the Holy
[2:10:48] Ghost because I spoke in tongues." He
[2:10:49] said, "You can't do it."
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; You got to be sanctified first.
[2:10:57] God's not going to come in and dwell
[2:11:01] a spirit a vessel that is not clean. So
[2:11:05] as we are as we're looking at this for a
[2:11:07] moment and you know this he he had great
[2:11:12] experiences with God he believed that it
[2:11:14] was a spiritfilled
[2:11:16] meeting. Now it wasn't as dramatic
[2:11:19] outward signs like like tongues at
[2:11:22] Pentecost
[2:11:23] you know it was more often an inward
[2:11:26] assurance of cleansing, a release from
[2:11:29] inward struggle, an overflowing of love
[2:11:31] and joy in God. And and and he compared
[2:11:35] it to Acts 15, which says they purified
[2:11:39] their hearts by faith. And of course,
[2:11:42] many of them shout it when they received
[2:11:45] it. Rolled in the floor, danced in the
[2:11:48] spirit, got drunk. They
[2:11:52] listen, you think, "Well, that's the
[2:11:54] Holy Ghost." It was
[2:11:57] But it was only in the level of
[2:11:59] sanctification.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Just because of you roll in the floor,
[2:12:08] run down the aisle, jump in the pew,
[2:12:11] shout at the top of your voice, doesn't
[2:12:13] mean that it's not the Holy Ghost. Sure,
[2:12:16] it's the Holy Ghost on you, but it don't
[2:12:19] mean the Holy Ghost should come and
[2:12:20] dwell in you. That's right.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; We want to see what happened to you
[2:12:25] after you jumped.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; We want to see what took place after you
[2:12:31] shouted.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon would say they
[2:12:37] thought when they shouted they got it.
[2:12:40] And he said
[2:12:42] many of them thought when you get happy
[2:12:45] enough to shout you got it. But many of
[2:12:47] them shouted and didn't have it.
[2:12:51] You see, they got the emotion of it,
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; but they failed to get the indwelling of
[2:12:57] it. Amen.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Now, so now as we're looking at this, I
[2:13:03] I want to want to go on in this because
[2:13:08] you see things begin to change
[2:13:12] because originally it would come with
[2:13:15] such power, such anointing,
[2:13:19] such a move of the spirit until
[2:13:22] you it would even show physically on the
[2:13:25] individuals.
[2:13:27] they would have great ecstasy shouting
[2:13:30] and figning and trembling. Now Wesley
[2:13:34] did the right thing. He cautioned that
[2:13:37] the true evidence was not emotion but
[2:13:40] inward assurance and holy living.
[2:13:44] So he he put a emphasis not is not on
[2:13:47] the sh is on the holy living. Amen.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; And so now, so the Methodists of John
[2:13:55] Wesley's era and the decades after his
[2:13:58] revival, there were full of dramatic
[2:14:02] revival scenes. There was shouting,
[2:14:05] figning, weeping, even people falling
[2:14:08] under the power. But by the mid to the
[2:14:11] late 1800s, much of this had changed.
[2:14:15] Now, let's talk about this change. Now
[2:14:18] remember
[2:14:20] it had changed
[2:14:22] from because of the nickelans
[2:14:26] from what happened in Acts two and
[2:14:29] brother Brandhams tells us in the second
[2:14:31] seal you can read it yourself when they
[2:14:34] begin to witness to the dignitaries and
[2:14:38] brought them into the church their
[2:14:39] bosses
[2:14:41] centurions and great men and whatever
[2:14:45] they it wasn't dignified him.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; They couldn't take to them people
[2:14:51] shouting and manifestations of the
[2:14:55] spirit.
[2:14:57] So they were embarrassed by it. So they
[2:15:00] wanted to dress it up.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; I'm using his words.
[2:15:05] Now, so now here in the reformation, I
[2:15:08] want you to notice here the spirit of
[2:15:11] God's moving and here the antichrist
[2:15:14] comes in with his doctrines of nickel
[2:15:19] because he wants to dress it up.
[2:15:24] So under Wesley and early Methodist
[2:15:26] preachers like George Whitefield,
[2:15:28] emotional outbursts were common. camp
[2:15:30] meetings in America, especially early
[2:15:32] early 1800s in Canidge, Kentucky. This
[2:15:35] is history you can read about. It was
[2:15:37] famous for people shouting, trembling,
[2:15:39] dancing, even falling as if dead. And
[2:15:42] these were seen as signs of deepening
[2:15:45] conviction and encounters with God.
[2:15:48] And Methodism was known as a shouting
[2:15:52] church. Now, Brother L, Brother L,
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; when you left the Methodist church, was
[2:16:00] it still known as a shouting church?
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:16:07] The shout had long gone.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; What was it now? Rituals and
[2:16:14] formalities.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Now watch. In the mid mid 18 1800s
[2:16:21] there was a move among them
[2:16:25] of growing respectability.
[2:16:31] As Methodistism spread and became one of
[2:16:34] the largest denominations in America and
[2:16:38] Britain, it began to seek social
[2:16:41] respectability.
[2:16:44] The middle class members often felt
[2:16:47] embarrassed
[2:16:49] by the wildfire of the early revival
[2:16:52] scenes.
[2:16:55] Now, Brother Brandon would say, "I'd
[2:16:58] rather have wildfire than no fire."
[2:17:04] But by the 1840s and 1860s, many
[2:17:07] Methodist leaders began emphasizing
[2:17:10] order, education, and refinement in
[2:17:13] worship and emotional experiences were
[2:17:17] increasingly discouraged in the main
[2:17:20] Methodist church.
[2:17:23] Now,
[2:17:27] so what happened? They purposely distant
[2:17:31] themselves from dramatic manifestations
[2:17:35] for several reasons.
[2:17:38] One, a desire for social acceptance.
[2:17:44] As Methodists moved into the middle
[2:17:46] class, they wanted to be seen as
[2:17:48] respectable Christian, not emotional
[2:17:51] enthusiast.
[2:17:54] Then two, fear of disorder. You know,
[2:17:57] they had church order
[2:18:00] and they would actually church order the
[2:18:02] spirit out. Leaders feared the emotional
[2:18:05] outburst would give critics reason to
[2:18:08] attack the church as fanaticals.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; So they're embarrassed by these Holy
[2:18:16] Spirit moves.
[2:18:19] Then three, they had a theological
[2:18:22] change.
[2:18:25] By the mid 1800s, methodism emphasized
[2:18:29] moral improvement, education, social
[2:18:32] reform, temperance, abolition over
[2:18:36] revivalist experiences.
[2:18:39] So social problems and answers to them
[2:18:44] meant more than an experience with
[2:18:48] Christ.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing a pattern?
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; So by the late 1800s,
[2:18:58] Methodists, mainline Methodistism was
[2:19:01] mostly formal and restrained and
[2:19:04] institutional.
[2:19:06] And those who longed for the old fire.
[2:19:08] And there were those that did, they
[2:19:11] continued on into the holiness movement.
[2:19:14] How many brother here's brother Brandon
[2:19:15] talk about pilgrim holiness.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Well, the Nazarines,
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; they were the shouting Methodists.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; They wanted to continue on with the with
[2:19:24] the with the rejoicing, the joy of the
[2:19:27] Lord, the shout
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; divine healing. They didn't you see the
[2:19:32] spirit was moving. And it's like the
[2:19:34] stalk the life was moving from that and
[2:19:36] moving now into another area. And
[2:19:38] brother Brandon would even call this the
[2:19:41] the the pilgrim holiness age. It was not
[2:19:44] another age but it was just a time where
[2:19:46] the spirit of God was moving and it
[2:19:49] moved now from the formal Methodist
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; and was moving forward
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; toward Isuza Street and finally the
[2:19:58] token.
[2:19:59] So now as you so you can see Methodism
[2:20:03] itself became respectable and quiet and
[2:20:07] these holiness outshoots offshoots they
[2:20:10] carried this shouting camp meetings
[2:20:12] style forward but hey it wasn't long
[2:20:16] they lost the shout
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; because of why
[2:20:23] the desire for respectability
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; not wanting to be fanatical.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; Having proper church order.
[2:20:37] There was a man by the name of Nathan
[2:20:39] Bangs. He was a Methodist leader in the
[2:20:41] 1800s.
[2:20:42] He was an early historian of American
[2:20:45] Methodism. And by 19 1838, he wrote
[2:20:48] critically of these older camp meetings.
[2:20:50] Now watch. There is no necessity
[2:20:54] for those convulsions of the body, those
[2:20:58] loud outcries, those violent agitations
[2:21:01] which sometimes attended revivals, they
[2:21:04] are not essential to to religion. We
[2:21:07] don't need it.
[2:21:11] They're not even necessary. We don't
[2:21:12] want them. We don't want them. We don't
[2:21:14] need it. And fact of the matter is
[2:21:17] they're just convulsions of the body,
[2:21:19] violent outcries and violent agitations
[2:21:23] and we don't want it.
[2:21:25] And he saw emotionalism as an
[2:21:28] embarrassment and he urged Methodists
[2:21:31] toward a calmer, more respectable style.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham told us and I read
[2:21:40] it last week in the Smyrnian age. He
[2:21:42] said when this nickel come in that
[2:21:44] wanted to get away from those clapping
[2:21:45] of hands and those shouting and the
[2:21:47] gifts of the spirit and whatever else he
[2:21:49] said it would they were bitter
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; and he says smrna means bitter and they
[2:21:55] were filled with bitterness. They were
[2:21:57] bitter against the Holy Ghost movement.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Now watch here was see here it is. Now
[2:22:07] I'm showing you the cycle of revival and
[2:22:11] death.
[2:22:12] Now, don't get in a hurry to go. I'm not
[2:22:14] even watching the time
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; because I I've got somewhere I want to
[2:22:18] go.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Now, Methodist
[2:22:23] Methodist Episcopal discipline,
[2:22:27] the Methodist Episcopal Church, the
[2:22:30] largest American Methodist body, began
[2:22:33] to emphasize order and decency in
[2:22:35] worship.
[2:22:38] And a line was often quoted from its
[2:22:41] discipline was let all things be done
[2:22:43] and decently and in order without
[2:22:46] confusion or noise.
[2:22:51] So
[2:22:53] they took the shouting out of the
[2:22:54] church. They took the moving of the Holy
[2:22:57] Spirit out.
[2:23:02] Watch now. This was deliberately aimed
[2:23:04] at suppressing shouting, figning, and
[2:23:07] ecstatic outburst. And I'll tell you
[2:23:09] what your prophet said. I may have the
[2:23:11] quote for it in a minute. He said, "If
[2:23:12] they would have just let them alone and
[2:23:15] would have not poured water in the face,
[2:23:17] he said they would have went on to
[2:23:18] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost."
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; So you have William Warren Sweet, a
[2:23:27] Methodist historian.
[2:23:29] Looking back, he summarized how
[2:23:32] Methodistism shifted. Methodistism
[2:23:35] having moved into the middle class, it
[2:23:37] had no desire to be regarded as religion
[2:23:40] of the ignorant and the emotional.
[2:23:44] It was becoming a church of
[2:23:46] respectability.
[2:23:51] And this was a conscience distancing
[2:23:53] from camp meeting enthusiasm. and early
[2:23:57] 1800 leaders like Nathan Baines wanted
[2:23:59] to suppress emotional outbursts calling
[2:24:01] them unnecessary. Um mid uh 1800
[2:24:05] preachers like Henry Bone lamented the
[2:24:08] shouting Methodist was disappearing.
[2:24:11] Historians note that Methodistism
[2:24:13] deliberately became respectable and
[2:24:16] distanced itself from shouting and
[2:24:19] fainting.
[2:24:21] So here again he was now ignorant
[2:24:25] uneducated,
[2:24:29] immature.
[2:24:32] You hear me?
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you're really in the mature in
[2:24:36] the word.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; So this is what
[2:24:41] as brother Brandham said they had myrr.
[2:24:44] It showed they were dying.
[2:24:48] Now, brother Brandham does say this. He
[2:24:51] said, "And you, oh, dear old Methodist,
[2:24:53] tonight Baptist here, that's what your
[2:24:55] father preached and believed years ago
[2:24:57] down here through the New England spa
[2:24:59] states here. When Wesley and Asbury come
[2:25:02] through here, they had to rent schools.
[2:25:03] They'd fall under the power of God. Lay
[2:25:05] there till the morning until the in the
[2:25:07] power of the Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit.
[2:25:09] They pour water and fam them with fans
[2:25:11] and everything. But you got starchy
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; and got away. Not you, dear children,
[2:25:18] your pastors
[2:25:20] because they begin to think more of
[2:25:22] theology and doctrines than they did of
[2:25:25] letting the spir holy spirit have its
[2:25:28] way.
[2:25:29] And this is just the Holy Spirit
[2:25:31] continuing on in his church.
[2:25:35] Now he's describing what he had there in
[2:25:38] that meeting.
[2:25:40] So now again he says I look back upon
[2:25:44] them Lutheran, Methodists, Pentecostals,
[2:25:48] Nazarene, Pilgrim Holiness, all the
[2:25:50] great churches we have and I think in
[2:25:52] their early origins how they had a
[2:25:54] lifeline on them. the spirit, the Holy
[2:25:56] Spirit was in them and how God sent them
[2:25:59] of the rushing mighty wind like he did
[2:26:01] on the day of Pentecost and how they
[2:26:02] frolked in the blessings of God with
[2:26:05] with their heavy foliage on them and and
[2:26:07] the winds caught them like sails and
[2:26:10] sail back and forth revival after
[2:26:12] revival. But then there comes something
[2:26:14] that happened. The fires of persecution.
[2:26:18] Notice now the persecutions rising in
[2:26:22] the church itself
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; against the Holy Ghost
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; it's not even from outside but they were
[2:26:31] afraid to be thought fanatical
[2:26:34] and he says watch now watch what he says
[2:26:38] when they got off into seminaries and
[2:26:42] got boys and men who were brilliant and
[2:26:44] intellectual and and taught out
[2:26:47] taught cut out the old baptism of the
[2:26:50] Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit. They cut the
[2:26:53] lifeline
[2:26:54] when the Methodist rivals revival used
[2:26:57] to strike in the nations where they'd
[2:26:59] lay in the school houses on the floor
[2:27:01] and receive the Holy Spirit and become
[2:27:03] knocked out as we call it today. And or
[2:27:05] in their days, they thought they'd
[2:27:07] fainted in our own Baptist church. I've
[2:27:09] seen that in our Baptist church. take
[2:27:11] pictures of water from the pulpit and
[2:27:13] pour it on the people's faces and fan
[2:27:14] them and cry when they were laying there
[2:27:16] under the power of the spirit.
[2:27:21] But the new teachers,
[2:27:25] what
[2:27:26] brother Bradom tells us in Christ the
[2:27:28] mystery, he says they all started out,
[2:27:32] but he said what got in the church was
[2:27:34] fallen angels
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; who brought in Satan's life. Now what
[2:27:40] was Satan's lie that followed the church
[2:27:43] nickelanism and balamism?
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; Watch now the new teachers, the old
[2:27:50] country church was done away and they
[2:27:52] brought in the more elaborate, the more
[2:27:53] fantastic, the educated side of on the
[2:27:56] side of the altar being betterly
[2:27:58] decorated or the pipe organ and the
[2:28:00] seats all pushed and pushed and and the
[2:28:02] old church was done away with. The old
[2:28:04] altar take was taken. The oldfashioned
[2:28:07] martyr's bench was taken out and put
[2:28:09] down in the basement. Said, "Well,
[2:28:11] brother Tim, we don't believe in altar
[2:28:13] calls. You don't believe in altar
[2:28:14] calls." We do
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham in one of his
[2:28:19] last sermons said, "I want to have an
[2:28:20] oldfashioned altar call,
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; God still moves in them."
[2:28:27] And he says instead of souls on the
[2:28:29] altar with liies on the altar instead of
[2:28:31] oldfashioned organ they used to pump
[2:28:33] with the stick or the tune old tuning
[2:28:35] for when they sang I'll fear no evil and
[2:28:37] I come to die. Instead of that it was a
[2:28:39] well-trained tri choir with melodious
[2:28:42] voice that sang such hymns until they
[2:28:45] would hold on to they were blue in the
[2:28:46] face and call it class. That's the most
[2:28:48] miserable thing I ever sat under was to
[2:28:50] hear an overtrained voice at a hold a
[2:28:52] note until they're blew in the face to
[2:28:54] try to put us on a show and that's all
[2:28:56] it is. You're not singing to the glory
[2:28:58] of God. And the sweetest thing under
[2:29:01] heaven is an oldfashioned spiritfilled
[2:29:03] church with the Holy Ghost. Everybody's
[2:29:06] singing in the spirit, but they cut the
[2:29:08] lifeline. When they cut the singing and
[2:29:11] when they taken the days of miracles
[2:29:13] away from the church and adopted their
[2:29:14] own theology and their intellectuals
[2:29:17] instead of the baptism of the Holy
[2:29:18] Ghost, they cut the lifeline. No doubt
[2:29:20] there are great denominations. So them
[2:29:23] was great. So is them great trees. They
[2:29:25] can prove by history they had done great
[2:29:28] things. The one that looked at this
[2:29:29] forest could prove they were once great
[2:29:31] thriving trees, but today they're
[2:29:34] nothing but bleak. The lifeline is gone.
[2:29:36] And he was viewing a burnover forest.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; And he says that when God sends his wind
[2:29:44] down for his trees to frolic and to take
[2:29:47] new life by the pushing of the trees,
[2:29:49] what to do? They set up a mournful
[2:29:51] sound. I'll tell this congregation, if
[2:29:54] any of them attend that divine healing
[2:29:56] campaign, immediately they'll be
[2:29:58] excommunicated from this fellowship.
[2:30:00] some little preacher with more
[2:30:01] intellectual than he's got sense to
[2:30:03] govern and stand up there with a tuxedo
[2:30:06] coat and bow with an amen like a calf
[2:30:08] and a man like a cow with a cramp and
[2:30:12] then try to to to place that to take the
[2:30:16] place of the Holy Ghost. It'll never do
[2:30:18] it. God's eternal plan of salvation for
[2:30:21] his people is the Holy Spirit in the
[2:30:23] church. born again men and women
[2:30:25] operated by the Holy Spirit. Not them
[2:30:28] trying to operate the Holy Spirit, but
[2:30:30] the Holy Spirit operating in them.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; That's it. We don't need men trying to
[2:30:36] operate, trying to control the spirit.
[2:30:40] We need men and women under the control
[2:30:42] of the spirit.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit operating in them.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:30:51] Well, we got here in the third exodus,
[2:30:54] him telling why they went back down to
[2:30:56] England,
[2:30:57] why why Israel had to leave the promised
[2:31:00] land, go to Egypt and become slaves.
[2:31:04] What made denominations?
[2:31:06] And he says the same thing has happened
[2:31:08] today. They got rid of Joseph because
[2:31:11] they didn't think they would need the
[2:31:12] supernatural.
[2:31:15] So they thought because our churches
[2:31:17] have become intellectual, we got the
[2:31:19] best dress crowds, the B biggest
[2:31:21] organization, the most smartest
[2:31:22] ministers that we have no use of the
[2:31:24] Holy Spirit the way it was back there.
[2:31:27] They are full, in other words, actions
[2:31:29] speak louder than words that their
[2:31:31] seminar is their brain of their being.
[2:31:33] They're coming together. They're
[2:31:34] discussing the thing are more able with
[2:31:36] their own intellectual mind to set a
[2:31:38] church in order better than what the
[2:31:39] Holy Spirit can do it. So they don't
[2:31:41] need it anymore. It's something we don't
[2:31:44] need today. It's the days of his past
[2:31:46] that now. Isn't that just right? We
[2:31:48] don't need the Holy Spirit to heal the
[2:31:50] sick. We got doctors. We don't need the
[2:31:52] Holy Spirit to speak with tongues. We
[2:31:54] are intellectual people. And when you
[2:31:56] do, you take right from your framework
[2:31:59] the lifeline. Jesus said to them Jews in
[2:32:02] that day, "Haven't you read that the
[2:32:04] stone that was rejected is the chief
[2:32:07] cornerstone that all the building is
[2:32:10] setting upon?" Now, you see what I mean?
[2:32:12] I'm sure you can catch that. The reason
[2:32:14] of it is they thought they would never
[2:32:16] have need of it. We don't need speakers
[2:32:18] with tongues. Oh, this is well after the
[2:32:21] seals. This is the third exodus. Brother
[2:32:25] Brandon saying they're saying we don't
[2:32:27] need speakers with tongue. We don't need
[2:32:29] interpreters of tongue. We no longer
[2:32:31] need Old Testament prophets to set us in
[2:32:33] order by the Holy Spirit. We understand
[2:32:35] that. And we are they have adopted a
[2:32:38] man-made system to take the place of the
[2:32:40] Holy Spirit. Therefore,
[2:32:42] there is a people
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; that's elected
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; that has their name on the lamb's book
[2:32:48] of life.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; They can't go for that.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; They are spiritual minded and therefore
[2:32:55] they cannot go for that. They cannot
[2:32:58] stand it no matter if their fathers and
[2:33:01] mother lived in whatever organizational
[2:33:03] church. Amen.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; When a church does that, maybe it
[2:33:07] wouldn't speak it right out. Oh no, they
[2:33:08] wouldn't speak it out, but their actions
[2:33:10] prove it. Here's the word. The Holy
[2:33:12] Spirit proves it among them. And he'll
[2:33:14] get them ga he when he can get them
[2:33:16] gathered together, he still heals the
[2:33:17] sick. He raises the dead, speaks with
[2:33:19] tongue, cast out devil. So it depends
[2:33:21] what's on the inside the person. The
[2:33:23] church feels they don't need the Holy
[2:33:26] Spirit. The church will tell you that
[2:33:28] the man will stand up and give you such
[2:33:30] an intellectual talk can almost make you
[2:33:33] to believe it. Now stop there here a
[2:33:35] minute. Didn't Jesus say the two would
[2:33:37] be so close together it would deceive
[2:33:39] the very elected if it was possible? The
[2:33:42] intellectual talks would be so smooth
[2:33:45] that it would deceive the people. It's
[2:33:47] the gospel is men who can handle that
[2:33:50] word in such a way that he could almost
[2:33:53] make any intellectual person, if you're
[2:33:55] trusting in your intellectual, they
[2:33:57] would condemn the Holy Spirit and take
[2:33:58] the way of man.
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:34:05] so as you can see,
[2:34:08] here's what the prophet taught. And of
[2:34:10] course, in the indictment, he tells you
[2:34:12] what they're doing. They are crucifying
[2:34:15] the effects
[2:34:20] of the gospel. Now, did Methodists still
[2:34:24] preach from the Bible?
[2:34:26] Did they still sing songs?
[2:34:29] Did they still have orders and worships
[2:34:31] and bishops and men and preachers and
[2:34:33] priests and
[2:34:36] churches and organizations? Yes.
[2:34:40] But they crucified the effects
[2:34:44] of the gospel.
[2:34:47] by their creeds. That's the crucifixion.
[2:34:49] That's where the public sets and these
[2:34:51] big morgs called churches, denominations
[2:34:54] draw a line of creed. The word of God
[2:34:56] can't have effect upon them because they
[2:34:58] condemn the very things that Christ said
[2:35:01] would take would take place. It just
[2:35:03] doesn't come accord according to their
[2:35:04] creed. So, brother Brandham tells us in
[2:35:08] Palmer, canker, locust, cankerworm. He
[2:35:11] said, "You know what was once a tree,
[2:35:14] that's a Pentecostal church, too got the
[2:35:16] hardest kick I ever got about divine
[2:35:18] healing was from an Assembly God man."
[2:35:20] That's Trinity Pentecost. We had an
[2:35:22] armory down at Hot Springs, Arkansas. We
[2:35:26] couldn't have enough seats. We had
[2:35:28] several thousand people. He had a great
[2:35:30] lot of seats. And anybody that believed
[2:35:32] in divine healing couldn't even set on
[2:35:34] his seats. That's what he said. Oh my,
[2:35:37] what a shame. What's the matter? What's
[2:35:39] the same thing? You've taken the route
[2:35:41] of the dead tree. What the palm worm
[2:35:44] left the canker. The Baptist took away
[2:35:47] the the shouting away from the
[2:35:49] Methodist. One eat this and one eat that
[2:35:52] until they stripped the church down
[2:35:54] until they got themselves sitting just
[2:35:56] as dead as a doornail. No spirit, no
[2:35:59] shouting, no joy, no peace, no healing,
[2:36:02] no nothing. what the Bapt the Methodists
[2:36:06] left the Baptist eating. What the
[2:36:07] Baptist left the Cathell eating or some
[2:36:10] other church and this one eat this and
[2:36:12] this and took away that and this and
[2:36:13] took that away and you ain't got nothing
[2:36:15] but just a church creed. And you know
[2:36:18] that's the truth.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; But God said I will restore.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; There's a restoration.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not going to leave us a
[2:36:32] stripped down tree.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; So we find that the old palmer one took
[2:36:37] the joy away.
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; You know, David said that he lost the
[2:36:41] joy of his salvation. He didn't lose his
[2:36:43] salvation. He just lost the joy of it. I
[2:36:45] tell you, there's some people like him.
[2:36:47] Write that right here today.
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You had lost your salvation. You
[2:36:50] just lost the joy of it. And he said,
[2:36:52] "Lord, restore to me the joy of thy
[2:36:55] salvation."
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; Like, and so this little palm worm begin
[2:36:58] to eat that fruit of joy out. And look
[2:37:01] at here. You people make too much noise.
[2:37:05] I tell you all this crying, this saying
[2:37:07] amen, this shouting, that's nonsense.
[2:37:09] There's nothing to that. See, first
[2:37:10] thing you know, he sat in a big morg,
[2:37:13] you know, sat there all them dead. Some
[2:37:16] of these inbalming fluids of so-called
[2:37:18] doctrine of creeds pumped into their
[2:37:20] veins where the spirit of God ought to
[2:37:22] be running where the old church creed
[2:37:24] pumped in there. No wonder they're icy
[2:37:27] and cold and dead. spiritual thermometer
[2:37:30] 90 degrees below zero. Yeah. Somebody
[2:37:32] say amen. And everybody struck stretch
[2:37:35] their neck around like some kind of
[2:37:36] goose or something. Want to know what it
[2:37:38] said? It's a shame when the spirit of
[2:37:40] God ought to be joy, peace, love. But
[2:37:43] this little bug started eating on it and
[2:37:45] he ate all the joy away.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you're not a tree. I'm
[2:37:50] just saying the the palmer worm has got
[2:37:53] to you.
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; It's taken away the lifeline.
[2:37:57] How many times have I read it already
[2:37:59] that brother Brandon said, "This was the
[2:38:01] lifeline."
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Where the spirit moved in the body?
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; I happened to look that night when the
[2:38:09] wind was blowing. It was stiff and dead
[2:38:11] and there moaning and groaning. Didn't
[2:38:14] have no light to bend with, no bark to
[2:38:16] make it flexible. And it was just
[2:38:17] moaning and groaning with the wind. Oh
[2:38:20] my. Doctor so and so said so and so. Oh
[2:38:22] my. But I happen to notice.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:26] I happened to notice.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; I happened to notice.
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; I happened to notice down underneath
[2:38:33] there
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; was some undergrowth coming up
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; some little bushes about like that. They
[2:38:39] had life in them. And when the spirit
[2:38:41] began to hit them, they were just
[2:38:43] twisting and ringing and shouting and
[2:38:45] having a glorious time. Let me tell you,
[2:38:47] brother, God's going to raise up a
[2:38:50] generation of people out of all this
[2:38:52] dead stuff that's going to restore, says
[2:38:55] the Lord. God's going to raise up people
[2:38:59] who believes in signs and wonders. And
[2:39:02] going to raise up people who's got joy
[2:39:04] unspeakable and full of glory. And when
[2:39:07] the mighty Russian wind comes, it gives
[2:39:10] right to it. And it frolics and dances
[2:39:13] and glorifies God. and green leaves are
[2:39:15] clapping your hand and having a
[2:39:17] wonderful time.
[2:39:20] Hallelujah. What if you're moaning? If
[2:39:23] you're moaning about, I rejoice. If
[2:39:26] you're moaning and groaning because we
[2:39:28] shout, if you're moaning and groaning,
[2:39:30] you're just an old tree. But I tell you,
[2:39:32] there's someone there's a life in it.
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; And when the spirit moves, they got to
[2:39:36] move with it.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:49] So the holy and woundedness movement
[2:39:52] notice cycle of revival and death.
[2:39:56] Holiness movement rose reaction
[2:39:59] trying to recover the fiery
[2:40:02] experiential side
[2:40:05] Wesley had championed.
[2:40:08] So this same drift had happened in
[2:40:10] Methodistism.
[2:40:12] It would happen in Isus movement and
[2:40:15] it's now happening in the message.
[2:40:18] And the message is dying.
[2:40:21] The movement not the message. The
[2:40:24] movement is dying. From revival fire to
[2:40:28] growth and organization to
[2:40:30] respectability to co cooling off.
[2:40:34] Emotional outbursts are downplayed.
[2:40:36] Holiness is softened. Whirlenness seeps
[2:40:39] in. The warning of Leoa applies. Because
[2:40:42] thou art lukewarm
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; and neither cold nor hot, I will spew
[2:40:47] you out of my mouth.
[2:40:54] At Pentecost,
[2:40:57] carrying the cycle now. At Pentecost,
[2:41:01] there was the fiery beginning.
[2:41:03] The spirit fell. Believers spoke in
[2:41:06] other languages.
[2:41:08] They prophesied. They had power. In Acts
[2:41:11] four, the place was shaken
[2:41:14] with when they prayed and then they were
[2:41:18] filled with boldness. The early church
[2:41:20] lived with supernatural fire, miracles,
[2:41:23] and separation from the world. This was
[2:41:27] the upper room birth of the church. Pure
[2:41:31] spiritfilled,
[2:41:32] unashamed.
[2:41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:36] These are not drunk as you suppose,
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; but this is that which the prophet Joel
[2:41:41] spoke. They were not ashamed.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; They were not embarrassed.
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; Peter didn't say, "Listen, I better
[2:41:52] start a bunch of church order here. You
[2:41:53] done got a little wild here. There's too
[2:41:55] much wildfire here." He said, "No, let's
[2:41:57] fan the flames. Why don't you get it,
[2:41:59] too?
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; Let it catch on to somebody else. Repent
[2:42:03] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:42:05] Christ. Receive the Holy Ghost and 3,000
[2:42:08] caught on fire.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; More than the 120.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; So then the drift toward respectability
[2:42:15] began immediately after Pentecost. The
[2:42:18] fire of the spirit was resisted by the
[2:42:20] deeds of the nickel.
[2:42:22] What was once a spontaneous spiritled
[2:42:25] people became grow gradually formalized
[2:42:28] and controlled
[2:42:31] and the church gained respectability in
[2:42:33] the world but it lost its simplicity
[2:42:37] and its power.
[2:42:42] And so here comes the rise of the
[2:42:44] nickelanism.
[2:42:47] His power lays in his doctrine.
[2:42:50] He is an impersonator
[2:42:55] and the rise of there was his first
[2:42:57] seeds of formalism.
[2:43:00] So he said but this thou hast thou
[2:43:02] hatest the deeds of nickel. So already
[2:43:05] in the first age they were working
[2:43:09] in revelation 2:15 to Pergamus. So thou
[2:43:11] hast them that hold the doctrine of
[2:43:14] nicicoatans, which thing I hate.
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; The nickelans were among those were were
[2:43:22] those who began to establish a clerical
[2:43:25] order, separating clergy from leoty,
[2:43:27] attempting to make the church
[2:43:29] structured, respectable, and
[2:43:32] authoritative in the eyes of the world.
[2:43:34] And so what began as deeds in Ephesus
[2:43:36] became doctrine by Pergamus.
[2:43:40] So you see it's slowly closing in.
[2:43:45] And so as this happened there becomes a
[2:43:49] drift
[2:43:51] toward respectability
[2:43:54] and it sought the church sought to be
[2:43:56] seen as respectable by the Roman
[2:43:58] society. And by the third century
[2:44:01] Christianity began adopting rituals and
[2:44:03] hierarchies drifting from the s fiery
[2:44:06] simplicity of acts. And they modeled
[2:44:09] after the Old Testament priesthood and
[2:44:12] the pagan rights of the pagans.
[2:44:15] And leaders emphasize order and theology
[2:44:20] over the direct leading of the spirit.
[2:44:24] And the same shift began from fire to
[2:44:28] form, from spirit to structure.
[2:44:32] Watch now until we finally come to the
[2:44:36] full compromise
[2:44:37] which was Constantine
[2:44:40] and he legalized Christianity and the
[2:44:43] church was wedded to the state and it
[2:44:45] was there that it gained respectability
[2:44:47] but it lost its power and its purity.
[2:44:51] Pagan practice was mingled with
[2:44:53] Christian ritual and the church became a
[2:44:55] worldly institution and the cycle was
[2:44:58] complete. fire, growth, respectability,
[2:45:01] compromise and the church went into
[2:45:04] death.
[2:45:05] So the pattern has repeated in every
[2:45:08] age. In the early age was the acts then
[2:45:12] the nickels come in. Finally Rome
[2:45:15] then the reformation Luther's fire
[2:45:18] becomes Luther's formalism and God
[2:45:20] raises up Wesley and Wesley's fire gives
[2:45:23] a way to Methodist respectability and
[2:45:26] Pentecostal Isuza fire it became
[2:45:29] denominational Pentecostal
[2:45:31] respectability. So every revival started
[2:45:34] in fire and ended in form.
[2:45:39] And remember, it is a form of godliness,
[2:45:43] but denying the power thereof. Now, I
[2:45:45] want you to watch the prophetic eye that
[2:45:49] warns us about what will happen. And in
[2:45:53] one of his and I'm taking some very of
[2:45:56] his last sermons that he preached and he
[2:45:59] said in the message of shame, notice the
[2:46:01] title, ashamed, embarrassed.
[2:46:05] &gt;&gt; Embarrassed.
[2:46:08] And this is what the church became
[2:46:09] embarrassed.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; Methodists became embarrassed. Luther's
[2:46:14] became embarrassed.
[2:46:17] Those old old ones there from the book
[2:46:19] of acts became embarrassed.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; What a respectability.
[2:46:25] Notice the same thing. Someone says,
[2:46:26] "Are you a Christian?" Oh, it's a
[2:46:28] popular thing. Say, "I'm a Christian."
[2:46:30] But do you believe the word of God which
[2:46:32] said these signs shall follow them that
[2:46:34] believe? You know what that says? In my
[2:46:37] name, they'll cast out devils.
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; In my name, they will speak with new
[2:46:44] tongues.
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; In my name, they'll do marvelous works.
[2:46:48] Come on, somebody.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; These signs follow them that believe.
[2:46:51] And oh, even ministers faces will blush.
[2:46:56] Are you ashamed, say, of divine healing?
[2:46:59] Some don't even want prayer lines no
[2:47:01] more.
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; Forbid them.
[2:47:05] Are you ashamed of the full gospel? Are
[2:47:08] you ashamed of your Pentecostal
[2:47:10] experience? Oh, I bet they are.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; That's being ashamed of his word.
[2:47:18] &gt;&gt; That's his word made flesh in you.
[2:47:25] So, brother Brandham in one of his last
[2:47:28] sermons here before he leaves that one
[2:47:31] some of the last messages
[2:47:33] of the seventh angel that he imparts.
[2:47:37] He asks, "Are you ashamed? Will you be
[2:47:41] ashamed? Will this message go down like
[2:47:44] all the others and be ashamed and
[2:47:47] embarrassed?
[2:47:54] And you know, oh yeah,
[2:47:58] this caused the church become the
[2:48:01] prostitute of revelation 17. The deeds
[2:48:04] of the nickelans, the teachings of
[2:48:07] balamism, substituted rituals for the
[2:48:10] new birth. And that's what we did, just
[2:48:12] rituals. Come up, say, I believe the
[2:48:15] message. I'm going to go baptize you.
[2:48:18] You go down a dry center and come up a
[2:48:20] wet one.
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; Rituals.
[2:48:27] Turn it into rituals
[2:48:31] and deny the experience.
[2:48:35] And then he likens it to the modern
[2:48:39] woman today. If you'll listen to
[2:48:40] invisible union, he tells you how the
[2:48:43] woman does not want to bear children
[2:48:45] anymore. She would rather party. She
[2:48:47] don't want to stretch out her body. She
[2:48:49] wants to keep her physique. She does not
[2:48:51] want children that would embarrass her.
[2:48:56] And so he talks about he talks about
[2:49:00] spiritual or shall we say he talks about
[2:49:02] them using birth control to keep from
[2:49:04] having children. And of course today you
[2:49:07] know they even use abortion as form of
[2:49:09] birth control. They'll actually kill the
[2:49:12] unborn.
[2:49:14] Now, we're bringing it right down to
[2:49:16] preachers and to the church. And he
[2:49:18] said, "That is a true picture of the
[2:49:22] modern church today. Neither does this
[2:49:24] modern church want any of them
[2:49:26] screaming, shouting, tongue speaking."
[2:49:29] Acts 2:38, youngest around her. Yeah.
[2:49:31] She don't want any of them hoofing and
[2:49:33] crying and screaming. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:49:36] Wow. Such a child would immediately put
[2:49:39] her out of her denomination. They had
[2:49:42] like one like that in one of the
[2:49:44] churches. I'd throw her out right quick.
[2:49:46] Why are you letting such stuff as this
[2:49:48] go along?
[2:49:53] What are they doing? Practicing
[2:49:55] spiritual birth control,
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; killing the unborn,
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; of burning the baby murdered
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; from the pull pit. You say, "Brother
[2:50:07] Tim, they don't do it." Brother Brandham
[2:50:09] said they're guilty of murder
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; indictment.
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; They're not only murdering Christ,
[2:50:18] they're murdering his offspring
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; until the church does not have the
[2:50:23] strength to bring forth.
[2:50:26] &gt;&gt; Atmospheres are never created for a
[2:50:29] birth.
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; Now, so again, we come right down here.
[2:50:35] This is a true picture of the modern
[2:50:37] church. Watch. Let's see if I can get
[2:50:39] this to go one more time. There we go.
[2:50:41] So, she's pregnantated with something
[2:50:43] cuz she's bringing forth members all the
[2:50:45] time. But she don't want none of them
[2:50:47] screaming, hollering, blabbering. Acts
[2:50:50] 2:38 miserable creatures that she thinks
[2:50:52] they are. Well, that would certainly
[2:50:54] embarrass her.
[2:50:57] It would ruin her and her educated,
[2:50:59] ethical, scientific society church that
[2:51:02] she belonged to here. They would throw
[2:51:04] her out at the next council. She can't
[2:51:06] have it. So she don't want to be
[2:51:08] pregnantated with the word
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; because that's the only kind.
[2:51:16] &gt;&gt; Is somebody with me?
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; That's the only kind
[2:51:21] &gt;&gt; that the word can bring forth.
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Tim, today we want a born
[2:51:27] of the word. We want a born of the
[2:51:29] message. Well, if you want a born of the
[2:51:31] message, it's Acts chapter 2:38. Repent,
[2:51:34] be baptized, or be filled with the Holy
[2:51:36] Ghost. That's the new birth.
[2:51:40] Born of the spirit of God. It has a
[2:51:42] spirit of God. Not intellectual church
[2:51:44] join creep going bob hair painted faith.
[2:51:47] There are no such thing as that that at
[2:51:49] all. You don't find that in the word of
[2:51:50] God. You find an oldfashioned sanctified
[2:51:54] Holy Ghost fililled child born of the
[2:51:57] spirit of God screaming, shouting,
[2:51:59] hollering, praising God.
[2:52:05] This is only a month before he leaves,
[2:52:09] before his voice is silenced.
[2:52:19] Notice what she loves. Watch her lover.
[2:52:22] You want to see who she's in love with?
[2:52:24] The word says it. Well, my church says
[2:52:26] that. Who she in love with? Who's her
[2:52:27] husband? Her own fruits proves what she
[2:52:30] is exactly right. shows what she has
[2:52:32] noticed. She was born first to Adam.
[2:52:34] That because that's her natural birth
[2:52:35] and she's never left that. That's a
[2:52:37] lover of the world. She claims she is
[2:52:39] born the second time to Christ. But her
[2:52:42] lover notices Adam yet because she loves
[2:52:45] the world. And notice what kind of
[2:52:47] children she is bearing. That tells what
[2:52:50] their papa is. Whether it's the first
[2:52:52] Adam or the second Adams. If the church
[2:52:54] brings forth a child of the second Adam,
[2:52:57] that's Jesus Christ. He acts the second
[2:53:00] way of Adam's second way. The second
[2:53:03] Adam's way of acting like they did on
[2:53:05] the day of Pentecost. That's really
[2:53:07] true. Second Adam's children. See, their
[2:53:10] nature's like his and hers. Yes. Her
[2:53:13] daughter's painted face, bobbed hair,
[2:53:15] wearing men's clothes, trouser. The
[2:53:17] Bible says not to do it. She cuts her
[2:53:19] hair. It's a shame to her.
[2:53:22] Why?
[2:53:24] She don't want to be inconvenience with
[2:53:26] children.
[2:53:28] We don't want them screaming around the
[2:53:30] altar. We don't have to spend time
[2:53:32] praying through with them.
[2:53:35] We we we just want a an easy fix and say
[2:53:38] you believe the message and you got it.
[2:53:46] Brother Brandon told us
[2:53:48] that people would come afraid of the new
[2:53:51] birth.
[2:53:55] &gt;&gt; Said they're afraid of it. He said, "I
[2:53:57] don't care what level you come. It's on.
[2:53:59] It's in it's a mess. If it's out yonder
[2:54:02] in a pig pen, any birth is a mess. If
[2:54:04] it's in a pig pen, if it's in a couch
[2:54:06] stable, it's in a pink decorated
[2:54:08] hospital room. I don't care where the
[2:54:10] birth takes place. It's a mess. And a
[2:54:12] new birth is the same. It'll make you do
[2:54:15] things you didn't think you would do.
[2:54:17] You might cry boohoo and round rub
[2:54:19] around an altar. No matter what you do,
[2:54:21] I've never asked God. It wouldn't do any
[2:54:22] good to try to bring the new birth to my
[2:54:24] level. I want to meet God's level of the
[2:54:27] new birth and receive it. I don't care
[2:54:29] what I have to do.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; Someone said, "I'm afraid to receive the
[2:54:33] Holy Ghost. I'm afraid it might make me
[2:54:36] speak in tongues like them others. I
[2:54:38] don't care if I spoke in tongues, talked
[2:54:40] in tonesues, crowed in tonesues, or
[2:54:43] anything else. I want the Holy Ghost.
[2:54:45] That's the main principle. I don't care
[2:54:47] what level is. I meet God on his level."
[2:54:51] Amen. That's where I want to stand. What
[2:54:53] he says is right. The new birth that
[2:54:55] changes a man, changes a woman, changes
[2:54:58] a desire, changes the appetite. Wrestle
[2:55:00] with God until you can hold on to the
[2:55:02] blessing comes. That's what happened to
[2:55:04] Jacob.
[2:55:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:10] Now look at this title. A deceived
[2:55:14] church by the world.
[2:55:17] Where do we start with this? Matthew
[2:55:19] 24:24.
[2:55:21] When I started teaching you three
[2:55:23] Sundays, two Sundays ago, three Sundays
[2:55:25] ago, deception. Here's where the great
[2:55:28] Leodysia,
[2:55:30] the most deceiving age.
[2:55:32] And brother Brandon's preaching to his
[2:55:34] own church, a deceived church by the
[2:55:37] world. That's the reason people go and
[2:55:39] join organization and substitute, what's
[2:55:42] the word? Substitute, a handshake
[2:55:45] instead of the new birth. They're trying
[2:55:46] to baptize baptize the new birth. They
[2:55:50] don't want the new birth. They know we
[2:55:52] teach it in the Bible. So, they want to
[2:55:54] substitute something for it. And the
[2:55:57] Pentecostal people are just as bad
[2:55:58] trying to substitute something. They
[2:56:00] want want it in class. It must be so
[2:56:03] classy. We'll shake hands, join the
[2:56:05] church, be sprinkled, be baptized,
[2:56:07] something. They're afraid of the new
[2:56:09] birth. I sometimes believe the Brandom
[2:56:13] Tabernacles getting afraid of it. And it
[2:56:16] did.
[2:56:19] Even now they'll condemn the Pentecostal
[2:56:21] experience
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; and say the token is a tape.
[2:56:31] &gt;&gt; Now we know what a birth is. I don't
[2:56:33] care where it is whereabouts. It's a
[2:56:35] mess. A baby's born on a sh pile on a
[2:56:38] hollowed floor in a pink decorated
[2:56:40] hospital room is a mess. Anyhow, a birth
[2:56:42] of a cat, birth of anything else is a
[2:56:44] mess. And he teaches us all the way
[2:56:46] through 65. And the new birth is nothing
[2:56:49] less than a mess. But people get so
[2:56:51] starchy. We'll go over where they shake
[2:56:53] hands. We'll go over where they don't
[2:56:54] ball and cry and beat on the altar and
[2:56:56] cry out. You want to be too human.
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; And what we need is a birth dying out to
[2:57:03] bring forth new life.
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; Where's our power? Where's our glory?
[2:57:06] What is it? Because we went out the
[2:57:08] wisdom of man and stood the power of
[2:57:10] God. Our preachers and things is so
[2:57:12] stiff and starchy till they organize us.
[2:57:14] till we're so starchy and stiff necked
[2:57:16] to people. You'll never hear a shout in
[2:57:18] the church anymore. You'll never hear
[2:57:20] anybody cry. The mourers's is put
[2:57:22] in the basement. There's no more glory
[2:57:24] in the church. All we said is do is sit
[2:57:27] back just as stiff as we can. We're not
[2:57:29] free. We're bound. The devil with his
[2:57:31] modernistic demons has bound the church
[2:57:33] of the living God. There's no power in
[2:57:35] the church. There's no more freedom. The
[2:57:37] people are starchy and stiff. What the
[2:57:39] God can come in the midst of Pentecostal
[2:57:41] people and show he's God and proves the
[2:57:43] signs of his resurrection it don't shake
[2:57:45] them glory why is it it's a disgrace I
[2:57:49] walk across the country God performing
[2:57:52] working performing signs and people sat
[2:57:54] and say well I guess that's all right oh
[2:57:56] I know it can be done it doesn't move
[2:57:58] them they're bound with Delilah the
[2:58:00] world they are in fears
[2:58:06] &gt;&gt; now They've even got them into bound
[2:58:10] into a confederation. The Philistines
[2:58:12] are on these Samson. What are you going
[2:58:14] to do about it? Oh, we got great
[2:58:16] denomination. Sure. We got greater
[2:58:19] memberships than we ever had. But
[2:58:21] where's the spirit?
[2:58:24] Where is the Holy Ghost?
[2:58:27] &gt;&gt; That's what the devil's done. It's wooed
[2:58:30] the church. It's kept wooing the church.
[2:58:32] Come to me. I'll give you a big great
[2:58:34] big tabernacle over here if you'll just
[2:58:36] do this. If you'll get rid of that
[2:58:37] fanatic preacher and you got and get a
[2:58:39] man of doctor divinity that's got some
[2:58:41] sense, we'll build a nice big classical
[2:58:43] church, we'll be like the rest of them.
[2:58:45] Shame on you. I'd rather have a man that
[2:58:47] didn't know split coffee from beans but
[2:58:50] was filled with the Holy Ghost that was
[2:58:52] uncompromised by the power of God. Amen.
[2:58:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, but it's got so starchy till some
[2:58:58] poor saint can break through in the
[2:59:00] meeting and speak in tongues or shout a
[2:59:01] little bit and something or something
[2:59:03] the rest of them will all gander about
[2:59:06] around and look and say, "What was
[2:59:08] that?" Well, I wonder why. That must be
[2:59:10] some fanatic dropped in somewhere. You
[2:59:12] know that's the truth. Some poor saints
[2:59:14] step in, get happy enough to raise their
[2:59:16] hands and cry and praise the Lord. And
[2:59:18] somebody will holler amen to the
[2:59:20] preaching of the gospel. And the rest of
[2:59:22] them turn around and see. See what he
[2:59:24] said? That's Pentecostals. What's the
[2:59:26] matter? You're patterned after the
[2:59:28] Methodist, after the Baptist. They
[2:59:31] patterned after the Catholic. And the
[2:59:32] Catholic patterned after hell. And all
[2:59:35] together, they're all after hell.
[2:59:40] &gt;&gt; What an indictment.
[2:59:51] Nickelans, a doctrine from hell,
[2:59:54] &gt;&gt; came into the Lutheran
[2:59:57] and then the Westwinds patterned after
[2:59:58] it
[3:00:00] &gt;&gt; and the Baptists
[3:00:01] and then the Pentecostals. And now we're
[3:00:04] wanting to do it in the message
[3:00:08] &gt;&gt; because they want a pattern after hell
[3:00:11] instead of the original pattern which is
[3:00:14] Acts chapter 2.
[3:00:23] Delilah has wooed you into big churches.
[3:00:26] Find educated ministers. Take the better
[3:00:29] class. Well, you know, such and so.
[3:00:31] Here's a millionaire. We could just get
[3:00:33] him to come in our congregation. Oh my.
[3:00:35] If he isn't born again, then he doesn't
[3:00:37] deserve to be there.
[3:00:40] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach.
[3:00:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care if he's a millionaire. If
[3:00:44] he ain't born again, he don't deserve to
[3:00:47] be in the church.
[3:00:49] &gt;&gt; He needs to be at the altar.
[3:00:54] &gt;&gt; If he owns 40 Cadillacs, whatever he's
[3:00:56] got, he's got to be born again. Come
[3:00:58] right down to a new birth, be
[3:01:00] regenerated, and come out there with a
[3:01:02] new birth, naughty,
[3:01:04] excuse me, a crying and screaming and
[3:01:06] carrying on like the rest of them do.
[3:01:08] And live a life outwards to prove it.
[3:01:11] He's got it.
[3:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what you knew in the
[3:01:14] Samson. The Philistines upon you.
[3:01:17] Communist is upon you. The world's upon
[3:01:19] you. The devil's upon you.
[3:01:22] So here we come.
[3:01:27] I'm going to conclude.
[3:01:32] I've read all these quotes.
[3:01:35] I've showed you the decline.
[3:01:39] I've showed you the spirit of
[3:01:42] nickelanism
[3:01:44] has moved right now and it's moved right
[3:01:46] into the message.
[3:01:50] But right now for the next few minutes
[3:01:53] and I'm going to be a little longer
[3:01:55] today,
[3:01:58] but I want you to understand
[3:02:01] the cycle breaks.
[3:02:03] This cycle of revival and death breaks
[3:02:08] in the end time bride.
[3:02:13] &gt;&gt; We will not continue
[3:02:16] this cycle.
[3:02:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:02:20] &gt;&gt; This last age is not promised another
[3:02:24] cycle.
[3:02:26] &gt;&gt; There's no more ages to come. That's
[3:02:28] right.
[3:02:29] &gt;&gt; There is not another cycle of re of
[3:02:31] revival, fire, and death, but a final
[3:02:34] cycle,
[3:02:36] &gt;&gt; a final harvest of a bride made ready.
[3:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, after the grain, the only
[3:02:42] thing left is the garner.
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; And we have reached the grain.
[3:02:48] &gt;&gt; We're not another part of the stock that
[3:02:50] will die.
[3:02:51] &gt;&gt; That the spirit will leave and move into
[3:02:53] another form. The only place we can move
[3:02:56] is upward.
[3:02:59] &gt;&gt; The only place we can go is higher.
[3:03:01] &gt;&gt; The only way we can get out of here is a
[3:03:04] rapture.
[3:03:05] &gt;&gt; And we will not be a people left behind.
[3:03:08] And God's not going to abandon his
[3:03:10] church.
[3:03:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are here at harvest time.
[3:03:17] It's the end of the world.
[3:03:20] There's no more to come after this. We
[3:03:22] are sealed to the day of redemption. And
[3:03:25] the marriage of the lamb has come and
[3:03:27] there's a people been made ready.
[3:03:29] Receive the token and the life.
[3:03:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's been churches, churches,
[3:03:36] bride, bride, churches, churches. But
[3:03:38] there's got to come one. There has to
[3:03:40] come a real bride. There's got to come
[3:03:42] one that's not only got the mechanics,
[3:03:44] but the dynamics to go with it.
[3:03:48] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach now.
[3:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. in a church with not just
[3:03:52] mechanics
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; but the dynamics
[3:03:56] &gt;&gt; predestinated Christ's a mystery there's
[3:03:59] a mystery he before Christ anything else
[3:04:02] was ever on earth you see his great
[3:04:04] mystery he chose a bride knowing ease
[3:04:06] would fall from disbelieving the word
[3:04:09] knowing she would fall but he would
[3:04:11] choose a bride that would not fall
[3:04:18] &gt;&gt; amens church was predestined to go down
[3:04:21] in the ground.
[3:04:23] &gt;&gt; Wesley and Luther, all they were
[3:04:25] predestined to come out, but they would
[3:04:27] die as the stalk.
[3:04:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:04:29] &gt;&gt; But you're not stalk, little children.
[3:04:32] You're the grain.
[3:04:33] &gt;&gt; And you have a different destiny.
[3:04:36] &gt;&gt; Your destiny is not failure.
[3:04:39] &gt;&gt; Your destiny is not defeat. Your destiny
[3:04:42] is not to lose your fire. Your destiny
[3:04:45] is not formalism. Your destiny is you
[3:04:49] are predestinated not to fall.
[3:04:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A people
[3:04:58] predestinated.
[3:05:01] That's your destiny. That's what you're
[3:05:04] called to. That's the hour that we're
[3:05:07] in.
[3:05:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:05:14] You are people who will break the cycle
[3:05:18] of revival and death because you don't
[3:05:22] have a partial prescription. You have
[3:05:25] the token,
[3:05:27] &gt;&gt; the literal life of Jesus Christ that
[3:05:31] inoculates you against failure, that
[3:05:34] inoculates you against going into
[3:05:37] decline, that inoculates you from ever
[3:05:40] losing the spirit. You're not gonna lose
[3:05:43] little children.
[3:05:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the word. It's not just
[3:05:55] emotion.
[3:05:58] Oh, many revivals begin with the spirit
[3:06:01] and the word, but then drift into form,
[3:06:04] replacing
[3:06:06] which is formalism
[3:06:08] &gt;&gt; and the word with tradition.
[3:06:10] But let me tell you about this bride.
[3:06:13] She's word born,
[3:06:15] &gt;&gt; wordfed, word sealed.
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; She are she is his disciples indeed
[3:06:21] because she will not stop.
[3:06:24] &gt;&gt; She will continue in his word. And if
[3:06:27] you continue in my word, you are my
[3:06:30] disciples indeed. There's a people
[3:06:32] continuing, not stopping.
[3:06:38] &gt;&gt; So we break the cycle.
[3:06:40] We break the cycle by maturity, by
[3:06:44] adoption, by coming the mature grain we
[3:06:47] were at Pentecost.
[3:06:48] &gt;&gt; We're no more servants, but we're sons.
[3:06:52] &gt;&gt; We are here in the revealing, the
[3:06:54] apocalyp, the manifestation of the sons
[3:06:58] of God. sons placed in maturity
[3:07:02] that will not return to the petty
[3:07:05] childess
[3:07:07] childlessness
[3:07:08] and immaturity of wanting social
[3:07:11] respectability
[3:07:13] over the power of the spirit.
[3:07:16] You call me immature because I want the
[3:07:18] Holy Ghost in his power,
[3:07:20] &gt;&gt; but I'm saying you are the child
[3:07:24] &gt;&gt; because you are you are a Lutheran or a
[3:07:27] Baptist or Method or something else. You
[3:07:29] have not come in advance. If you advance
[3:07:32] into maturity, you'll never choose
[3:07:34] social respectability over the power of
[3:07:36] the Holy Ghost.
[3:07:42] And we break the cycle
[3:07:45] by the rapture.
[3:07:49] &gt;&gt; Every other revival ended in decline
[3:07:52] because they were part of the weak
[3:07:54] drawing through the stages. But when the
[3:07:55] wheat bride comes to full maturity, she
[3:07:58] is harvested.
[3:07:59] Listen to me now. Not left to rot.
[3:08:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not going to be left
[3:08:08] to rot.
[3:08:10] But because you're mature grain, you're
[3:08:11] going to go in a rapture.
[3:08:14] &gt;&gt; Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall
[3:08:16] not all sleep, but we shall all be
[3:08:19] changed. How? In a moment, in a
[3:08:22] twinkling of an eye, at the last trump,
[3:08:24] for the trumpet shall sound, and the
[3:08:25] dead in Christ shall rise, and we shall
[3:08:29] be changed.
[3:08:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[3:08:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:08:36] This is answer.
[3:08:38] We break the cycle of revival and death
[3:08:41] &gt;&gt; because we're not repeating Pentecost
[3:08:46] decline or Methodist respectability.
[3:08:49] &gt;&gt; We are the harvest sealed by the token
[3:08:53] &gt;&gt; and destined for glory.
[3:08:56] &gt;&gt; We have received the eternal
[3:08:58] prescription,
[3:09:00] &gt;&gt; the inoculation against sin.
[3:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have received the sin cure.
[3:09:06] &gt;&gt; And the cycle of unbelief is over.
[3:09:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say you broke it.
[3:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You broke it. We're not going
[3:09:17] down. Those whose names are on the book
[3:09:19] of life will not stand for that.
[3:09:22] &gt;&gt; We will have the power of God. We will
[3:09:24] have the moving of the spirit. We will
[3:09:26] have the shout of the king. We will have
[3:09:29] all the word, the fullness of the word,
[3:09:31] and the power of that word. We will live
[3:09:33] in it, walk in it, talk in it, and enjoy
[3:09:35] it and experience it. Let us stand
[3:09:37] together and rejoice.
[3:09:45] &gt;&gt; You are breaking the cycle.
[3:09:49] &gt;&gt; You are refusing to cave
[3:09:53] &gt;&gt; to the persecution
[3:09:55] &gt;&gt; that says, "Oh, but you make too much
[3:09:57] noise."
[3:10:00] Listen, friend.
[3:10:04] where I come from,
[3:10:07] &gt;&gt; there's lots of noise.
[3:10:10] &gt;&gt; I can show you in Revelation chapter 5
[3:10:14] where we're where the redeemed people
[3:10:16] are all gathered there
[3:10:17] &gt;&gt; and the seals have been taken off of the
[3:10:19] book
[3:10:20] &gt;&gt; and the Bible said all creation heard me
[3:10:23] saying glory and honor and power.
[3:10:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything begin to cry out.
[3:10:29] All creation begin to worship God.
[3:10:32] &gt;&gt; I tell you what then, church, it's time
[3:10:34] that you and I reflect who we are in
[3:10:37] heaven.
[3:10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can reflect right now here on
[3:10:41] earth that the shout of the king is in
[3:10:43] our midst. That the glory of God is upon
[3:10:46] his people and the spirit of God can
[3:10:48] fill this place and your heart. God
[3:10:51] bless you.
[3:11:05] [Music]
[3:11:12] There were people almost everywhere
[3:11:19] that fell at Pentecost
[3:11:21] and made them clean. It is burning now
[3:11:25] within my heart. Glory to his name. I'm
[3:11:29] so glad that I can say I'm one of them.
[3:11:34] I'm one of them.
[3:11:37] I'm one of them.
[3:11:40] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[3:11:43] of them.

[3:11:48] I'm one of them. here. Oh, I'm so glad
[3:11:53] that I can say I'm one of them
[3:11:59] in the upper room all praying in his
[3:12:02] name. They were baptized with the Holy
[3:12:06] Ghost.
[3:12:09] What he did for them that day, he'll do
[3:12:12] for you the same. I'm so glad that I can
[3:12:16] say I'm one of them.
[3:12:19] I'm one of them.
[3:12:22] I'm one of them.
[3:12:25] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[3:12:29] of them.
[3:12:31] I'm one of them.
[3:12:34] I'm one of them.
[3:12:37] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I've
[3:12:40] heard first.
[3:12:42] And though these people may not learn to
[3:12:45] be nor
[3:12:48] they have all received their Pentecost
[3:12:52] baptized in Jesus name and are telling
[3:12:55] now both far and wide power is just the
[3:12:59] same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[3:13:03] of them.
[3:13:05] I'm one of them.
[3:13:08] I'm one of them.
[3:13:11] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[3:13:14] of them.
[3:13:17] I'm one of them.
[3:13:20] I'm one of them.
[3:13:23] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[3:13:26] them.
[3:13:28] Oh, come my brother. Seek this blessing.
[3:13:32] Let your hearts
[3:13:34] and we'll start the joy bells ringing.
[3:13:38] Keep your soul a flame. It is burning
[3:13:41] now within my heart. Glory to his name.
[3:13:46] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[3:13:49] them.
[3:13:51] I'm one of them.
[3:13:54] I'm one of them.
[3:13:57] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[3:14:00] of them.

[3:14:23] of them.

[3:14:58] them.
[3:15:02] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise.
[3:15:09] Hallelujah.
[3:15:11] Hallelujah.
[3:15:13] The Lord has brought me
[3:15:17] through all of my trials
[3:15:21] without.
[3:15:25] [Music]
[3:15:28] But he stood right by me
[3:15:31] through all of my trles.
[3:15:35] When I was lost, he didn't let me go.

[3:16:54] Oh, when I was lonely.
