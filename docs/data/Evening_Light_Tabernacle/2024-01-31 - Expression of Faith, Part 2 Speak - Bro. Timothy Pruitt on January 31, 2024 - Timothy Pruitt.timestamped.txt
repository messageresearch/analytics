[19:36] California there at an all Mexican
[19:38] church Spanish speaking working through
[19:40] an interpreter and I had arrived on
[19:44] Thursday and realized I was preaching

[19:49] other services for their special annual
[19:51] meetings brother Jonathan Suarez the
[19:53] brother that was here with us a month or
[19:55] so ago kind of put these meetings
[19:56] together and Sunday morning after the
[19:59] service the presence of the Lord just
[20:00] dropped down in a very special way uh in
[20:04] the services there was many that came
[20:05] for prayers seeking the Holy Ghost
[20:07] deliverance from addictions young people
[20:10] coming giving their hearts to the Lord
[20:11] seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[20:13] and the Lord just poured out wave after
[20:15] wave after wave on the people I was
[20:18] there for maybe an hour praying with the
[20:20] uh different ones and working through an
[20:22] interpreter brother Elias from Phoenix
[20:25] and then I went to the back just to kind
[20:26] of rest and you know thinking service
[20:29] was over he comes knocks on the door and
[20:32] says there's other people that need
[20:33] prayer and we go back out we pray again
[20:35] for another 45 minutes for the people
[20:37] and brother Johnson said he said brother
[20:39] Joe these meetings this weekend was
[20:41] historic he says we've hadn't had a move
[20:43] of God like that in many many many many
[20:47] many many years and one of the brothers
[20:49] that came up at the end of it and and
[20:52] I'll be brief he said look he said
[20:53] brother he said brother Joe he said you
[20:55] answered all my questions today' so
[20:58] Jonathan told me he said when he pulled
[21:00] up to in the parking lot of the church

[21:03] leave cuz he said if this is all that
[21:06] there is to this message if there all
[21:08] there is to the ministry he goes what's
[21:10] the purpose what's the use but he saw a
[21:12] display in the manifestation of the Holy
[21:14] Spirit and God came down and discerned
[21:17] his own heart when he came up for prayer
[21:19] discerned his family and the presence of
[21:21] God just fell and moved on the people
[21:23] and he said now I know there's more out

[44:23] man upon his convictions of God's
[44:25] Eternal truth truth that will take a
[44:28] stand positionally and stand we stand
[44:30] alone but not alone with
[44:35] God Amen the invisible companion who
[44:39] follows us through life's journey down
[44:42] through the Shadows of the Valley of the
[44:43] shadow of death and on into eternity he
[44:46] will go with us and be
[44:50] God hallelujah I'm thankful to serve him
[44:54] today amen amen you're happy to be in
[44:57] the house of the
[44:58] Lord turn our Bibles to Mark chap 11

[45:11] great God for our
[45:13] needs amen just ask you to be even I
[45:17] haven't said much about it maybe a few
[45:19] times but praying for us with us about
[45:22] sister Ruth's um trial thing we're in
[45:26] right now with her and her body they
[45:29] found a some type of they call it a
[45:31] tumor or a nodule right there in the top
[45:34] of her skull or somewhere in that area
[45:37] and the doctors are wanting to do
[45:39] surgery and so we're going to maybe have
[45:42] a consultation with him about that but
[45:45] we're just depending on our God because
[45:47] he has the final say amen and so just be
[45:51] in prayer about that the Lord will lead
[45:52] us in the right path in the right
[45:54] direction amen amen cuz he'll go with us
[45:57] no matter where and be
[45:59] God Amen Mark 11:22 and Jesus answered
[46:05] said un them have faith in God for
[46:08] verily I say unto you that what
[46:10] whosoever shall say to this mountain be
[46:13] thou removed and be thou cast into the
[46:15] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[46:18] shall believe that those things which he
[46:20] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[46:24] whatsoever he saith
[46:26] therefore I say unto you what what
[46:28] things soever you desire When you pray
[46:31] believe that you receive them and ye
[46:33] shall have them also Revelations 10 and
[46:37] verse 8 and the voice which I heard from
[46:39] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[46:42] and take the little book which is open
[46:44] in the hand of the Angel which standeth
[46:46] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[46:49] went unto the angel and said unto him
[46:52] give me the little book and he said unto
[46:54] me take it and eat it up and it shall
[46:56] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[46:59] thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[47:01] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[47:03] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[47:06] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[47:08] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[47:11] thou must prophesy again before many
[47:14] people Nations and tongues and Kings
[47:19] amen we let you be
[47:21] seated I'd like to speak to you again on
[47:24] the expression of faith
[47:27] um last week we spoke on
[47:29] praise this this week we'll speak on on
[47:33] speak amen your voice speaking the word
[47:37] of God is an expression of faith we we
[47:40] read in our scripture tonight in the
[47:43] previous verses we could read about
[47:45] Jesus as he went to the found the fig
[47:47] tree that had no fruit and he said no
[47:50] man eateth from thee and then after this
[47:53] verse they came and they saw that it had
[47:56] withered away and and Peter brought this
[47:59] to to their attention and he said you
[48:01] know if and then Jesus would say as we
[48:03] read if you say to this mountain be
[48:05] moved he notice he did not say if I say
[48:09] he said if you say if you say to this
[48:12] mountain be moved and we know that man
[48:15] could not move a mountain just by
[48:16] speaking to it on his own accord or his
[48:19] own
[48:19] ability me as a man I could not do that
[48:23] the only thing that can move a mountain
[48:25] would be deity amen deity so then if a
[48:28] mountain is before us and our objective
[48:31] is right and our motive is right and we
[48:33] speak the word of God it isn't us
[48:35] speaking anymore it's deity speaking
[48:39] then when deity speaks it has to move
[48:42] amen notice he didn't put a time frame
[48:44] in that he didn't he didn't put it say
[48:46] that you know it would move in the next
[48:48] five minutes or the next 5 years time
[48:50] means nothing to God time only means
[48:52] something to more the people that are
[48:54] mortal amen time means nothing to
[48:57] someone that's Immortal and so he did
[48:59] not put a time frame on it we like we
[49:01] like time frames we like to know
[49:03] schedules or or or when it might happen
[49:06] but it has not that has nothing to do
[49:08] with it he said you speak and it'll
[49:10] happen amen it doesn't matter if it's in
[49:12] the next five minutes or the next 5
[49:14] years or the next 50 years matters not
[49:17] amen a amen as you speak you must
[49:19] believe and then as you speak the sand
[49:22] of that mountain begins to move he said
[49:24] I truly believe believe that the church
[49:26] is on the brink of one of the greatest
[49:29] outpourings it's ever had in this age I
[49:31] believe it I can't say the Lord has told
[49:34] me but something inside of me is just
[49:36] catching a hold of something that I
[49:38] haven't seen in all my life till just
[49:40] now and how glory is to know just before
[49:43] the coming of the Lord that these things
[49:45] are happening amen Faith you know is so
[49:48] simple he says the scripture says faith
[49:51] is the substance of things hope for the
[49:54] evidence of things not seen in other
[49:56] words faith is not a myth it's not a hop
[49:59] so it's not a maybe it's something that
[50:01] you actually possess he said just like
[50:04] this and he uses that illustration he
[50:06] used many times about the quarter he
[50:08] says if I was starving and you came to
[50:11] me and said brother brandom I'm starving
[50:13] or I said I said I'm starving he said
[50:14] what well you what would save your life
[50:17] and I'd say maybe a loaf of bread and
[50:19] you'd go into your pocket and bring out
[50:21] 25 cents and hand it to me and say here
[50:23] you are Mr brandom you don't have to
[50:25] starve he said now I haven't got the
[50:27] bread yet but I've got the purchased
[50:29] power of the bread and that's exactly
[50:32] what faith is it may not may not be that
[50:35] it's actually in your hands as far as
[50:37] the evidence of what you can see amen
[50:39] but it is a purchased power that by his
[50:42] stripes I'm healed amen it's already
[50:44] done because his word says it is amen
[50:47] and he says see it's a purchased power
[50:49] of the bread I might be a mile from the
[50:52] bread or we might say it like this I
[50:53] might be five minutes from my healing or
[50:56] 5 Years From My healing or however long
[50:58] it is I can be just as happy with that
[51:01] quarter or that faith in my hand I can
[51:04] be when I got the bread in my when I
[51:06] have the bread in my hand because I've
[51:07] got the purchased power of the bread and
[51:10] he said when that faith is anchored that
[51:12] is finished you can just be as happy as
[51:15] you were amen if you was already healed
[51:18] and already you can jump about it you
[51:20] can shout about it cuz it's already over
[51:23] with amen you can have it it's already
[51:26] done it's something you know you've got
[51:28] nothing can move it from you you can
[51:30] never you'll never watch for any
[51:32] evidence or anything else you'll just
[51:34] know that you have it and he said when I
[51:36] got this bread or this 25 cents I may
[51:40] have to go over some heels I may have to
[51:42] go through some Brier patches I may have
[51:44] to go across some water I may have to
[51:47] cross Bridges but all the time I'm
[51:50] rejoicing cuz I've got the 25
[51:53] cents amen so rejoice joing and Faith
[51:56] goes together amen uh and speaking the
[51:59] word of God Amen we're not here to speak
[52:01] of our own accord or our own mind or our
[52:04] own thoughts about things amen we are
[52:06] here to speak the word of God because
[52:08] what I speak can fail what I speak can
[52:11] fall to the ground what I speak may not
[52:13] come to pass but what he says will not
[52:16] fail what he says will not fall to the
[52:19] ground what he says will come to pass
[52:22] amen so we can be rejoicing and thankful
[52:25] that what he said in his word you say I
[52:27] don't know if it's his will to heal well
[52:29] his word is his will so if it's in his
[52:32] word it is his will to heal therefore we
[52:35] can rejoice and thank God for our
[52:38] healing before it even happens
[52:40] hallelujah amen whatever it's in his
[52:43] word we can take it and believe it and
[52:45] rejoice about it he said most people
[52:47] have faith let me go back he said I
[52:49] might have to cross some bridges but all
[52:51] the time I'm rejoicing because I've got
[52:54] the 25 cents knowing I'm going to get
[52:56] bread just as soon as I get there it's
[52:59] the purchasing power well faith is the
[53:03] purchase power of things you have hoped
[53:06] for Hallelujah faith is the purchase
[53:10] power of things you're hop for that is
[53:12] genuine faith and nothing can move it he
[53:15] says most people have faith but they
[53:18] don't try to use what faith they've
[53:20] got am man you can have 25 cents but if
[53:23] you don't go now I understand the they
[53:25] Bread's way more than 25 but whatever it
[53:28] is $2.50 or
[53:31] $3.50 if you don't you can have it in
[53:33] your pocket all day long but if you
[53:35] don't slap it down on the counter and
[53:37] buy you a loaf of bread it'll never come
[53:39] to
[53:40] pass amen you got to put it into action
[53:43] amen you got to speak the word of God
[53:46] and this is what he said you got to have
[53:47] he said most people have faith but they
[53:49] don't try to use the faith they got he
[53:52] said I believe that every person that
[53:53] believes on the Lord Jesus
[53:56] Christ how many people believe on has a
[53:59] certain amount of Faith the reason that
[54:01] it's never used too much is because you
[54:03] never put it to use very
[54:06] much yeah okay and person a person
[54:09] usually coming to church will just come
[54:11] in listen to a sermon then they'll go up
[54:14] put their name on a church book become a
[54:16] good member of that church that's just
[54:17] about as far as they have ever had and
[54:20] the opportunity to use their faith faith
[54:22] will do just anything that you have need
[54:26] of being done if you'll put it to
[54:29] work amen faith will just do anything
[54:33] that you have need of being done if
[54:36] you'll put it to work but most churches
[54:38] today they got just as far as they can
[54:40] teach and that's just accept Jesus by
[54:43] faith and that's all to it that settles
[54:45] it that's like a man who was eating a
[54:47] slice of watermelon he said that was
[54:49] good but there's some more of it
[54:53] somewhere Hallelujah I believe we ought
[54:55] not ever get settled and satisfied in
[54:58] our work with God it ain't just
[55:00] believing on him and that's all there is
[55:02] to it there's more to this watermelon
[55:04] there's more to the slices that we can
[55:06] have amen there's more of what God has
[55:09] in store for his children he said he
[55:11] said when man accepts Christ as his
[55:13] personal savior then all the good things
[55:17] that God has promised is laying right
[55:20] there at his
[55:23] fingertips it's not way off somewhere
[55:25] and something hard to obtain it's right
[55:28] here at our fingertips just believe it
[55:31] don't go at it in a place where I wonder
[55:33] for the work just the same as you know
[55:35] you're going to get up and you need a
[55:37] drink of water so you're going to raise
[55:39] up and you're going to walk across the
[55:41] floor and you're going to get that drink
[55:43] of water that's just how simple it is
[55:46] when the Lord promised it that's all
[55:48] that settles it and just going about it
[55:50] that's real genuine
[55:53] Faith Hallelujah
[55:55] if a if people would if the church would
[55:57] put more faith to work you'll see more
[56:00] things take place in the church the
[56:02] pastor might stand on a Sunday morning
[56:04] he might stand on a Sunday evening or a
[56:06] Wednesday whatever preach hard on faith
[56:08] in a mighty message but if the members
[56:10] don't take that message and start
[56:13] putting it to work it'll fall right back
[56:15] again and the birds of the air will pick
[56:17] it up but just take it out and put it at
[56:20] work God want you to do
[56:23] that God wants you to to do that see he
[56:26] came in flesh 2,000 years ago he came to
[56:29] overcome the devil in every way and we
[56:31] can say man he did in sicknesses he
[56:34] overcame him in sin he overcame him in
[56:37] death he overcame him but his desire was
[56:40] for more than one body doing his Works
[56:44] amen he wanted more than one body
[56:46] destroying the works of the devil he
[56:48] wanted deity not just in one body but in
[56:51] many in a many membered body amen
[56:55] overcoming as he did overcoming him
[56:58] against sin as he overcame sin
[57:00] overcoming sickness as he overcame
[57:02] sickness The Works that I do shall you
[57:05] do also even greater than
[57:08] this and we want to know what the
[57:10] prophet taught on that he taught it
[57:12] wasn't greater that it's a greater
[57:13] Miracle he said it really the
[57:15] translation is more because it's not
[57:17] just one body no more it's a
[57:20] multi-member body all over the
[57:23] world Hallelujah just we just got a
[57:26] report from brother Danny del mundo
[57:28] going to a far outreaching Island there
[57:30] at the Philippines it's like five five
[57:33] hours by car and two hours by boat and
[57:35] he hears about a woman who' been struck
[57:37] down in her body by a stroke and she's
[57:40] laying there in a bed and and there he's
[57:43] asked to go pray for her he goes in and
[57:45] he lays hands as the Bible says Mark 16
[57:48] is what he quoted laid hands upon the
[57:50] sick and he said she sat up in bed and
[57:53] God done a miracle in her life right
[57:55] there amen and he said have done such a
[57:57] miracle her daughter they wouldn't even
[57:58] believer her her daughter had seen that
[58:00] miracle and said I must know this Jesus
[58:03] Christ and she was baptized in the name
[58:06] of the Lord Jesus
[58:08] Christ what was it it was putting faith
[58:12] into
[58:15] action it ain't up to me to fulfill it
[58:18] it's up to me to do what he said
[58:20] [Music]
[58:23] do it's he wanted more than one body he
[58:27] wanted a many membered body he wanted it
[58:30] in the Philippines he wanted it in Japan
[58:32] he wanted in Africa he wanted in Europe
[58:34] he wanted it all over the
[58:38] world deity defeating Satan's kingdom he
[58:42] said some people think of him back there
[58:45] as deity as a little baby he was the one
[58:49] that stood on the invisible platform and
[58:52] he reached out his hands and spoke and
[58:54] said said let there be light and there
[58:56] was light he said that was Jesus Christ
[58:58] for he was in the world and the world
[59:00] was made by him and the world recognized
[59:02] him not he was and he is the deity of
[59:05] God look what he did back there talk
[59:07] about the miraculous back there talk
[59:09] about shouting when he performed the
[59:11] miraculous things to make things which
[59:13] are now out of things which was not he
[59:15] spoke it and it was so and that same
[59:19] power that same Christ he said let the
[59:22] fundamentalist let them people who deny
[59:24] the power of God say it's wrong but the
[59:26] same power that spoke the world in
[59:28] existence is in the people that's got
[59:31] the Holy
[59:33] Ghost Hallelujah the same created Power
[59:37] that spoke this world into existence
[59:40] that same deity is not 2,000 years ago
[59:43] it's not somewhere in the wild blue
[59:45] yonder it's on Earth
[59:52] today that's right men and women it's
[59:55] time we found out who we
[1:00:01] are I think this is very amazing this is
[1:00:04] the very first sermon
[1:00:07] recorded the deity of Jesus Christ 1949
[1:00:11] 1225 of 1949 the very first sermon God
[1:00:15] is wanting us to hear who we
[1:00:19] are he's wanting to tell you amen the
[1:00:22] devil's trying to hide you back
[1:00:23] somewhere and tell you you're some
[1:00:25] little trotten down something you're
[1:00:29] not come on now you're made worthy by
[1:00:33] the blood of Jesus Christ your sons and
[1:00:35] daughters of God deity is not in heaven
[1:00:38] it's in
[1:00:40] you right there at the very first
[1:00:43] recorded sermon God is wanting us to
[1:00:45] know who we

[1:02:13] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:02:16] of the
[1:02:20] age why did he not leave you when you
[1:02:22] was in your doubts why did he not leave
[1:02:25] you when you was in your
[1:02:27] frustrations because he was held to you
[1:02:29] by his
[1:02:31] word to deny you he had to deny his word
[1:02:35] and he wasn't going to do that amen cuz
[1:02:38] that's who you are Christ in the manger
[1:02:40] no Christ in you hallelujah we're not
[1:02:42] worshiping Christ in the manger but
[1:02:44] Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of
[1:02:46] Life The Creator God himself dwelling
[1:02:49] again in
[1:02:53] humanity so another place he said if
[1:02:55] your life tallies up to the life of
[1:02:58] Jesus Christ in other words that same
[1:02:59] Spirit lives in you the Holy Ghost he
[1:03:02] said in his word if you say to this
[1:03:04] mountain be moved and don't doubt but
[1:03:07] believe that it's coming to pass you can
[1:03:09] have what you say what you
[1:03:12] say what you say the only way you can
[1:03:15] move that mountain would be have deity
[1:03:18] speaking when you're a Son of God you
[1:03:20] receive God which is zoy God's own life
[1:03:23] and you become part of God then if your
[1:03:25] objective right and your motive is right
[1:03:27] speak and watch what happened it has to
[1:03:31] take
[1:03:32] place it may not be on your time frame
[1:03:35] or the time that you want it done but
[1:03:37] that's not up to me amen it ain't up to
[1:03:39] me to fulfill the word of God it's up to
[1:03:41] me to speak the word of God it's up to
[1:03:44] me to speak what he said and then he'll
[1:03:46] do what he does amen God wants somebody
[1:03:50] who believe he said the word comes into
[1:03:52] you if the holy spirit is there there
[1:03:54] it'll make it alive as soon as it comes
[1:03:56] in and every promise is true therefore
[1:03:59] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[1:04:01] don't doubt in your heart because what
[1:04:03] you are deity
[1:04:09] speaking you are deity speaking you
[1:04:13] believe it the Bible said so whatsoever
[1:04:16] you shall come and shall whatsoever you
[1:04:19] say shall come to pass if you're not
[1:04:20] doubt it if you can get all the world
[1:04:23] bread out of here and let the Holy
[1:04:25] Spirit make you a full son or daughter
[1:04:27] no world no condemnation no doubt what
[1:04:30] is it then it's no more you it's God in
[1:04:33] you then you take his word it's a
[1:04:36] promise and say father it's your promise
[1:04:39] something's got to
[1:04:44] move of course you can't do it until God
[1:04:46] has revealed to you that that's a case
[1:04:48] should be amen when you know that the
[1:04:51] case shall be then you can say like
[1:04:53] Jesus he was is the word is that right
[1:04:55] yet Jesus the man the Tabernacle said I
[1:04:57] do nothing except the father show me
[1:05:00] first if it's not then it it is not the
[1:05:04] word then until it's made manifest to
[1:05:06] you you get it no wonder people say days
[1:05:08] of Miracles are passed why they say that
[1:05:10] cuz the word isn't manifest to
[1:05:13] them but you can't tell me days or
[1:05:16] Miracles are pass cuz that word's been
[1:05:17] made manifest to
[1:05:19] me amen I've seen it no wonder they
[1:05:22] can't believe in the holy spirit cuz the
[1:05:24] word's not made manifest to them no
[1:05:26] wonder they can't see the revelation of
[1:05:27] the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:29] cuz the word isn't manifest to them yet
[1:05:32] and yet they don't have one scripture
[1:05:34] there's no place where anybody was ever
[1:05:36] baptized any other way amen about the
[1:05:39] Holy Ghost the Bible said no man can
[1:05:41] call Jesus to Christ only by the Holy
[1:05:44] Ghost and people say they don't believe
[1:05:46] in the Holy Ghost is right see that's
[1:05:48] not made to
[1:05:49] them it's not been made manifest to them
[1:05:52] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:05:55] the father draw isn't that beautiful all
[1:05:57] the father has given me will come and
[1:06:01] I'll raise him up again at the last day
[1:06:03] oh my there's where our names are put on
[1:06:05] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:06:07] foundation of the world how could we
[1:06:09] ever doubt oh God take the doubt from
[1:06:12] Among
[1:06:13] Us take the doubt from Among Us
[1:06:16] circumcise our poor human hearts there
[1:06:18] there's no more doubt Among Us that's my
[1:06:21] prayer roll away every doubt
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:26] let this mind be in you that was also in
[1:06:29] Christ
[1:06:31] Jesus roll away the
[1:06:36] doubt in John 5 and verse4 we're told
[1:06:39] this this is the confidence that we have
[1:06:42] in him that if we ask anything in his
[1:06:46] will he heareth
[1:06:49] us amen you know it's hard to believe
[1:06:52] somebody's got confidence in you if
[1:06:53] they're questioning everything you
[1:06:55] do amen God it's hard for God to believe
[1:06:59] we got confidence in him if we're
[1:07:00] questioning everything he
[1:07:02] does but if we truly believe he's in
[1:07:05] control then we don't question
[1:07:09] him then we can have confidence that we
[1:07:13] have to have this confidence that if we
[1:07:14] ask anything according to his will his
[1:07:18] will is what his word according to his
[1:07:22] will he heareth us amen so if we ask to
[1:07:26] be healed he heareth
[1:07:30] us if we ask to be filled with the Holy
[1:07:33] Ghost he heareth us it's his word
[1:07:36] therefore it's his
[1:07:41] will he heareth us and if we know that
[1:07:44] he hear us whatsoever we ask we know
[1:07:48] that we have the petitions that we
[1:07:50] desire of
[1:07:52] him Hallelujah
[1:07:54] now here he goes now we ask what is the
[1:07:56] will of God there is only one way to
[1:07:59] know his will and that's by the
[1:08:02] word so if we're asking for things
[1:08:04] outside of the word then it's not his
[1:08:08] will
[1:08:10] amen you know I I you know people come
[1:08:12] up this idea well it was it was my will
[1:08:14] to marry that woman and she's divorced
[1:08:16] woman how could it be his will if it
[1:08:18] ain't in his word I don't care how many
[1:08:21] angels you had talked to you I don't
[1:08:23] care how many dreams you've had I don't
[1:08:25] care how many quotes you can find it's
[1:08:27] not in his word therefore it cannot be
[1:08:30] his
[1:08:32] will there it is if it's not in the word
[1:08:35] you can't have it so we can't ask unless
[1:08:37] it's in the word we can't petition or
[1:08:40] ask unless it's in his name there it is
[1:08:42] again Jesus the name is the word will
[1:08:45] you can't separate God and the word they
[1:08:47] are
[1:08:48] one then this word he's left behind us
[1:08:51] on printed page is a part of him when
[1:08:54] you accepted by faith into a spirit
[1:08:57] filled
[1:08:58] life not into an intellectual
[1:09:01] conception but a spirit filled life he
[1:09:05] said that his word was life in John 3
[1:09:08] 663 that's exactly what he is in John
[1:09:11] 14:6 he said I am the way the truth and
[1:09:14] the
[1:09:15] life Romans 88:9 said If any man have
[1:09:18] not the spirit of Christ he's none of
[1:09:20] his there it is he is spirit and he is
[1:09:22] life that is exactly what the word is
[1:09:26] spirit and life amen that's exactly what
[1:09:28] the word is that's exactly what Jesus is
[1:09:30] he is the word so when a spirit born
[1:09:33] Spirit-filled man in faith takes that
[1:09:36] word into his heart and places upon his
[1:09:39] lips why it's the same as deity speaking
[1:09:43] Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot
[1:09:47] stand before that
[1:09:49] man no wonder he don't want you to know
[1:09:52] who you are no wonder he don't want you
[1:09:54] to know you're a blood bought Holy Ghost
[1:09:56] filled Son of God and he's constantly
[1:09:58] trying to question your life and
[1:10:00] constantly trying to make you some think
[1:10:02] you some trotting down something cuz he
[1:10:04] knows if you ever get the revelation of
[1:10:07] who you are he cannot stand before you
[1:10:10] but he will be just as defeated and
[1:10:13] thwarted against you as he was 2,000
[1:10:15] years
[1:10:16] ago cuz it's the same life and it's the
[1:10:19] same
[1:10:21] power therefore he had the same
[1:10:33] effects but if he keep if he can keep
[1:10:36] some condemnation on you if he can keep
[1:10:38] you down in about something or some
[1:10:41] questions then he knows he can stand
[1:10:45] there but if you ever realize who you
[1:10:47] really are Satan can't stand before
[1:10:52] that amen Revelations 1:7 and 18 says
[1:10:56] when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[1:10:57] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:10:59] saying fear not I am the first and the
[1:11:01] last time he that liveth and was dead
[1:11:03] and behold I'm alive forever more amen
[1:11:06] and have the keys of hell and of death
[1:11:09] he said no human being could stand the
[1:11:11] effect of that Vision John's strength
[1:11:14] was utterly Gone John fell at his feet
[1:11:16] as though dead but the hand of the Lord
[1:11:18] in love touched him and the voice of
[1:11:20] blessing said fear not don't be afraid I
[1:11:23] am the first and last I am he that
[1:11:25] liveth was dead behold I'm alive forever
[1:11:28] more what what is there to fear judgment
[1:11:31] that fell on him at at the cross at the
[1:11:34] grave and when he descended was for
[1:11:37] us it was for me and he absorbed the
[1:11:41] full brunt of the wound of sin and there
[1:11:44] is therefore now no
[1:11:47] condemnation no condemnation to them
[1:11:50] that are in Christ
[1:11:52] Jesus hallelujah amen see for assurity
[1:11:56] our eternity is our judge he is both
[1:11:59] eternity and judge and his judge he says
[1:12:03] case is finished it is settled it is
[1:12:06] thrown out of
[1:12:07] court hall hallelujah he tells the devil
[1:12:11] you brought the wrong one in this time
[1:12:14] that's my son there and I have already
[1:12:16] paid the price for his sin it's
[1:12:22] finished it's dismissed it's over
[1:12:27] with what kind of power would we realize
[1:12:30] we would have if there's no condemnation
[1:12:33] what kind of services could we have if
[1:12:35] all condemnation was stripped off of us
[1:12:37] and we realize hey that's not who I am
[1:12:39] devil I'm a Son of God I came from God
[1:12:42] I'm going back to
[1:12:47] God why should the church fear what
[1:12:51] promise has he ever failed fail to
[1:12:53] manifest before
[1:12:58] us now you can go into the trial I was
[1:13:01] reading it today I ain't got at my notes
[1:13:03] but you can go into the trial and one of
[1:13:05] the worst worst cases that comes up is
[1:13:08] Mr
[1:13:11] impatient
[1:13:12] impatient you know we as humans
[1:13:15] especially in this time we living in we
[1:13:17] more impatient than ever that's
[1:13:21] right I mean think about but I I just
[1:13:25] thinking about this my trip I just got
[1:13:26] back from uh from uh going to Africa and
[1:13:30] Europe got into
[1:13:32] uh I got into uh Charles deal there and
[1:13:36] my plane was delayed you know what it
[1:13:39] did late enough that I was going to miss
[1:13:40] my connection in Atlanta had a good
[1:13:42] connection Bo I was proud of that
[1:13:43] connection I was going to get home
[1:13:46] early missed my connection had to wait
[1:13:49] another 4 and 1/2
[1:13:50] hours oh yeah and patience comes along
[1:13:54] and but if I had just lived a few
[1:13:56] hundred years ago it had took me a whole
[1:13:58] lot longer than what I just
[1:14:02] did I mean I spent 40 hours all together
[1:14:05] going to Africa and coming back in an
[1:14:07] airplane but I promise you a couple
[1:14:09] hundred years ago it it took me a whole
[1:14:11] lot longer than 40
[1:14:13] hours but we're now living in a time
[1:14:15] that we want everything right now and
[1:14:17] God forbid something disrupt it and get
[1:14:19] in our way and we want to get all
[1:14:20] anxious and impatient but listen God's
[1:14:22] trying to teach us something
[1:14:23] and when it comes to his promises it's
[1:14:25] on his
[1:14:26] [Applause]
[1:14:27] time and when it's time to be F
[1:14:30] fulfilled when it's time it will not be
[1:14:32] no
[1:14:34] delay Hallelujah there won't be no delay
[1:14:37] there won't be nothing stop it there
[1:14:39] won't be nothing hinder when it's time
[1:14:41] to come to fulfillment it will be
[1:14:48] fulfilled so do we trust
[1:14:51] him quite a question he asked brother
[1:14:53] Ron or said to brother Ron if you trust
[1:14:56] me I'll use you like never before oh God
[1:14:58] I trust you I didn't know it was going
[1:15:01] to be
[1:15:02] that that's not being brother Ron's
[1:15:04] attitude by no strength but that's the
[1:15:05] way we are sometimes Lord I trust you
[1:15:08] God next thing we know we're going
[1:15:09] through a trial man I'll be glad when I
[1:15:11] get out of this
[1:15:12] one I'm sick of this thing how impatient
[1:15:16] that we just get a few days ago when it
[1:15:18] rained for four or five days in a
[1:15:20] row I can't wait till this rain gets up
[1:15:23] with I'm so sick of it Meanwhile we're
[1:15:26] behind on our rainfall and we're needing
[1:15:28] a
[1:15:29] rain and we're fussing hey I'm just as
[1:15:31] guilty as anybody else I get sick of
[1:15:35] it but we need it it's a needful thing
[1:15:39] we got to have it so are
[1:15:42] trials they're not easy and they're
[1:15:45] sometimes very hard and very difficult
[1:15:47] but they're needed yes how would you
[1:15:50] know him as a savior if you never sin
[1:15:53] how would you know him as a Healer if
[1:15:54] you never had
[1:15:56] sickness how would you know him as a
[1:15:58] deliverer if you never was bound but God
[1:16:01] wanted you to know him in every
[1:16:04] attribute and he said if you'll trust me
[1:16:06] I'll lead you through
[1:16:10] this I'll never leave you I'll be right
[1:16:13] with you matter of fact you'll look back
[1:16:15] and see one set of footprints like oh
[1:16:17] yeah he left me no that's when he picked
[1:16:21] you up and he carried you
[1:16:28] hallelujah oh my how many times has he
[1:16:30] done that for us just picks us up when
[1:16:33] we get through across some of them
[1:16:34] Bridges brother BR talk some of them
[1:16:36] Brier patches we couldn't make it but
[1:16:38] we're still praising God anyhow and we
[1:16:40] run out of our own strength and he says
[1:16:42] all right child I got you and he picks
[1:16:44] you up and he carries you
[1:16:49] through
[1:16:51] Hallelujah but the there is now
[1:16:53] therefore no condemnation why should the
[1:16:56] church fear what promise has he ever
[1:16:58] failed to manifest before us why should
[1:17:00] I fear punishment or death it's all been
[1:17:04] overcome he's the mighty conqueror he's
[1:17:06] the one who conquered both the worlds of
[1:17:07] the seen and the Unseen not like Al
[1:17:10] Alexander or Napoleon who conquered this
[1:17:12] and this but finally Was Defeated this
[1:17:14] this this was there was nothing that
[1:17:16] could conquer Christ he that descended
[1:17:18] is now
[1:17:19] ascended and unto him has been given the
[1:17:22] name that is above every name yes he
[1:17:24] conquered death he conquered hell he
[1:17:27] conquered the grave and he has the keys
[1:17:29] thereof and whatever he loses is loose
[1:17:32] and whatever rebounds is bound and
[1:17:34] there's no change in there there's no
[1:17:36] conquer before him and there's none
[1:17:38] beside him he alone is savior I'm
[1:17:41] talking about your God tonight he alone
[1:17:43] is savior he alone is Redeemer he's the
[1:17:46] only God the Lord Jesus Christ is his
[1:17:49] name and it goes right into this don't
[1:17:52] fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all
[1:17:55] that I am you're air to all my power is
[1:17:59] yours my nness is yours as I stand in
[1:18:02] your midst I have not come to bring fear
[1:18:05] and failure but love and courage and
[1:18:08] ability all power is given unto me and

[1:18:18] [Applause]
[1:18:21] fail that's right
[1:18:24] yes
[1:18:28] sir when a man sinned when man sinned at
[1:18:32] the beginning he crossed a great Chasm
[1:18:35] there was a Chasm between him and
[1:18:38] God leaving no way
[1:18:40] back God took a
[1:18:42] substitute heard about it someone Sunday
[1:18:45] offered a substitute and he accepted
[1:18:47] that substitute if a man would accept
[1:18:48] the substitute for his place then he
[1:18:51] could come back in fellowship with God
[1:18:54] and then man for years went about
[1:18:56] through the blood of bulls and goats
[1:18:59] sheeps and animals but it would never
[1:19:01] take away the sin it only covered the
[1:19:05] sin he said that's what's happen but
[1:19:07] what then what happened what happened
[1:19:09] one day there came something that could
[1:19:13] remit
[1:19:14] sin remit is mean to lay aside partly or
[1:19:19] wholly to be released from the guilt or
[1:19:22] the penalty of
[1:19:23] am so there came a blood that could
[1:19:25] release you from the guilt of your
[1:19:31] sin not guilty
[1:19:34] anymore it can lay aside the sin
[1:19:39] holy you said there may be some
[1:19:41] scientist sitting here I'm going to make
[1:19:42] a remark and just call it going to call
[1:19:44] it something doesn't mean that at all
[1:19:46] just going to say it but he said we'll
[1:19:48] get one little simple drop of ink God
[1:19:51] can hide himself in that if it's a a
[1:19:52] drop of ink it has to be something
[1:19:54] before it was a drop of ink see what it
[1:19:55] is the first it's a drop of it's a it's
[1:19:58] a drop of ink what is it it's chemicals
[1:20:00] and so forth and he says but but when
[1:20:03] it's you take that and you drop it into
[1:20:06] bleach into a bleach he said what
[1:20:09] happens to it every molecule of it
[1:20:11] changed until where it can't be found
[1:20:18] anymore amen it can't be found anymore
[1:20:21] this is what he did for us he said they
[1:20:24] manufactor this stuff they called bleach
[1:20:26] he said you women use it different with
[1:20:27] chloroxide what happens it makes it to
[1:20:30] where it turns it back to where it was
[1:20:34] its original and he said that's exactly
[1:20:36] what the blood of Jesus does to sin the
[1:20:38] blood of Jesus Christ confess your sin
[1:20:40] upon the blood it omits it it puts it in
[1:20:43] the sea of forgetfulness to re be
[1:20:46] remembered no
[1:20:48] more to be remembered no more Hallelujah
[1:20:52] amen this Omid means to leave out or
[1:20:55] exclude intentionally
[1:20:59] amen God is intentional with your
[1:21:02] sins he is intentional he said it leaves
[1:21:05] it out either intentionally or
[1:21:09] forgetfully Hallelujah so he
[1:21:11] intentionally takes your sins and puts
[1:21:14] them in the sea of his
[1:21:17] forgetfulness he's some kind of God
[1:21:19] because you know how we are as human we
[1:21:21] can keep a list a mile long but you
[1:21:23] asked for forgiveness and is struck off
[1:21:26] not just for the next five minutes or
[1:21:28] the next five years or the next 50 years
[1:21:30] it's struck off period it's over with
[1:21:34] it's done it's
[1:21:37] finished I hope that'll give somebody
[1:21:39] some victory tonight the devil's been
[1:21:41] trying to hold them sins of your past
[1:21:43] over your head but you've already asked
[1:21:45] for forgiveness of it it's omitted it's
[1:21:48] forgotten intentionally done away
[1:21:51] with
[1:21:55] why does he do that to give you the
[1:21:57] courage to stand as an adopted son of
[1:22:00] God and speak his
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:07] word it's
[1:22:10] done we go back he said listen this is
[1:22:14] brother brother brother brandom's desire
[1:22:16] I'm trying to find where I is God hiding
[1:22:19] himself in Simplicity in
[1:22:21] 63 he
[1:22:25] said he said where is the church
[1:22:29] today if we're born to be sons of God
[1:22:34] Jesus himself said is it if your own law
[1:22:37] said you're Gods amateur Gods which
[1:22:38] control the Earth he said if they call
[1:22:40] those Gods whose the word of God came to
[1:22:43] the prophets the word of the Lord came
[1:22:45] to the prophets you call them Gods how
[1:22:47] do you condemn me when I say I am the
[1:22:48] Son of God he said of the blood of bulls
[1:22:51] and goats could give a power to Moses to
[1:22:55] go out there by the commission of God
[1:22:57] and stretch forth that rod and say Let
[1:22:58] There come flies he had the word and he
[1:23:01] spoke the word and when he did it became
[1:23:03] God's thought manifested expressed and
[1:23:05] so then when it was when it was God's
[1:23:07] thought put it in moses' mind and he
[1:23:09] spoke it it became a word and Moses
[1:23:12] turned and went back maybe not a fly in
[1:23:13] the country but within an hour from
[1:23:15] there maybe one old graen fly began to
[1:23:17] buzz around in a half an hour there was
[1:23:20] 10 lbs per square yard God God help me
[1:23:24] amen the creative word of God that was
[1:23:26] spoken by the lips of mortal
[1:23:28] man under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:23:31] that could not remit or omit
[1:23:34] sins he said God uses men God could use
[1:23:37] a son to preach the gospel God could use
[1:23:39] the wind to preach it but God chose men
[1:23:41] to preach the gospel what's the matter
[1:23:43] with the church today there's something
[1:23:45] wrong my opinion we're not coming with
[1:23:47] that sincerity to the right thing if God
[1:23:50] could do that by the blood of bulls and
[1:23:52] goats and Bulls that only covered sin
[1:23:55] made a pritu for The Sinner but the sin
[1:23:57] was still there only covered what can he
[1:24:00] do through the blood of his son that
[1:24:02] omits sin and God has not manufactured
[1:24:06] but he created a blood that takes away
[1:24:09] all sin and Mark 11:24 says whatever you
[1:24:13] say to this mountain move and don't
[1:24:15] doubt on your heart but believe what you
[1:24:17] said it will come to pass where is the
[1:24:20] Pentecostal church at today we don't
[1:24:22] realize that confess truly confess sins
[1:24:26] it has been omitted or done away with
[1:24:30] and it's built a bridge remember that
[1:24:32] Chasm this blood came and built a bridge
[1:24:35] across the chasm that brings you back
[1:24:37] into the presence of
[1:24:40] God hallelujah into the presence of the
[1:24:43] Creator and it makes you a Son of God
[1:24:46] and he said he that believeth on me the
[1:24:49] works that I do shall he do so Al that
[1:24:51] shall he do also amen there you are
[1:24:53] verily I say unto you if you say to this
[1:24:56] mountain be moved and don't doubt on
[1:24:57] your heart but believe what you said it
[1:25:00] shall come to
[1:25:03] pass you can have what you said see my
[1:25:08] it's my God revealing himself in
[1:25:14] humility God taking a humble
[1:25:17] Sinner and cleansing him by his blood
[1:25:21] and dropping that confess sin and the
[1:25:23] Clorox bleach of the blood of the Son of
[1:25:25] God and putting his own life into that
[1:25:27] man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:29] then if we have the genuine baptism of
[1:25:32] the Holy Ghost what's wrong with
[1:25:39] us when the type when Elijah dropped the
[1:25:43] robe for Elisha he got a double portion
[1:25:47] and Jesus said the works that I do shall
[1:25:49] you do also the greater than this shall
[1:25:51] you do for by going to my father what's
[1:25:54] wrong church question
[1:25:57] mark he said now you want to call us be
[1:26:00] above because of the visions and things
[1:26:02] like that get off my back
[1:26:08] amen hallelujah brother get off my back
[1:26:12] listen what he said brother get down to
[1:26:14] the
[1:26:16] Cross get the gospel we don't have to
[1:26:20] impersonate right
[1:26:23] come on now we don't have to impersonate
[1:26:25] why would we take an impersonation why
[1:26:27] would you take some false conception of
[1:26:29] it when the skies are full of the
[1:26:32] genuine Pentecostal power that makes a
[1:26:35] man or woman a son and daughter of God
[1:26:37] that takes him back in the presence of
[1:26:39] God they are God revealing himself in
[1:26:46] humility we're not
[1:26:48] impersonators we're back to the original
[1:26:51] amen
[1:26:55] but you got to get away from your own
[1:26:56] thoughts you got to let the mind of that
[1:26:59] was in Christ be in you you got to stay
[1:27:02] there till every sin of
[1:27:04] fear wow every sin of fear every sin of
[1:27:09] Doubt has gone from your
[1:27:12] heart what would they say he would tell
[1:27:14] them go and sin no more brother B would
[1:27:16] take you said what was he saying go and
[1:27:18] disbelieve no
[1:27:21] more
[1:27:24] people don't understand that disbelief
[1:27:27] is the very root of
[1:27:29] sin God help our
[1:27:34] unbelief he said I don't care how many
[1:27:36] degrees of doctors you have how many big
[1:27:37] churches you are what kind of big will
[1:27:39] you belong to how many organization
[1:27:40] whatever it is has nothing to do with it
[1:27:42] until your sins are confessed and in the
[1:27:45] blood of Jesus Christ you stand
[1:27:47] unadulterated born again son or daughter
[1:27:50] of God with the life of God in you to
[1:27:52] speak a word of
[1:27:57] creation hello
[1:28:00] somebody you stand unadulterated a born
[1:28:04] again son or daughter of God with the
[1:28:06] life of God in you to speak a word of
[1:28:10] creation let this mountain be moved and
[1:28:14] it will mind
[1:28:17] you it will mind
[1:28:20] you you know in speaking you know God
[1:28:24] Called Moses and he called him with a
[1:28:26] special
[1:28:27] calling and he said when God calls a man
[1:28:30] anoints him for a certain Duty he
[1:28:31] expects that man to carry it out to the
[1:28:33] letter God don't want to give a man a
[1:28:35] commission and him him hul around about
[1:28:37] it he wants him to go straight forward
[1:28:38] and do exactly what he commissioned him
[1:28:40] to do don't look right or left just move
[1:28:42] forward and I I want to put that in our
[1:28:44] boots amen he gave us commission Mark
[1:28:48] 16 he don't want you to him hul around
[1:28:51] he go lay hands on on the sick and let
[1:28:52] him worry about
[1:28:54] it let him fulfill it he will do what he
[1:28:57] said he would
[1:28:59] do that's his word he will not break his
[1:29:01] word amen he says see the children of
[1:29:04] Israel has been in bondage for some 400
[1:29:06] years but God had made a promise he
[1:29:08] would set them free or visit them and
[1:29:10] God keeps every promise that he makes he
[1:29:14] will not lie he's God and the time has
[1:29:17] come for this and the time had come for
[1:29:19] this visitation now watch this he said I
[1:29:22] believe tonight paralleling that God
[1:29:24] made a promise he would return
[1:29:27] again and I believe we're near that time
[1:29:31] this morning I believe it I can almost
[1:29:33] feel the current as they say The
[1:29:35] Nearness of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah
[1:29:38] now Moses being called for this purpose
[1:29:40] he was a man God trained him 80 years
[1:29:43] 100 years before 80 years before he's
[1:29:44] able to use him 40 years in the palace
[1:29:46] 40 years in the wilderness God can train
[1:29:49] a man take him a 100 years for 30
[1:29:51] minutes
[1:29:54] work but God knows how to
[1:29:59] train Hallelujah he been training a
[1:30:01] bride for 2,000
[1:30:05] years Hallelujah he been training us but
[1:30:09] he knows how to train amen God trains
[1:30:12] his man then anoints him and gives them
[1:30:14] experiences to take them through the
[1:30:15] rigid training down through the Sands of
[1:30:17] burning punishment trying testing not
[1:30:19] only does that to His prophets he does
[1:30:21] does it to his children every son that
[1:30:24] cometh to God must be chastened and
[1:30:25] tried tested by his word and when the
[1:30:28] pinch come the strong time when it faces
[1:30:31] death you'll be able to stand on the
[1:30:32] word of God and said God said so it's
[1:30:38] settled God had called such a
[1:30:41] man and the man was
[1:30:43] Moses but Moses was a great deal like
[1:30:48] us every time he came to a place
[1:30:50] something had to be done
[1:30:52] Moses saidoh Lord what must I do to this
[1:30:55] in this place now isn't that just like
[1:30:58] we
[1:30:59] do God had blessed him he had anointed
[1:31:02] him above his Brethren given him a
[1:31:04] message and a Ministry that had not been
[1:31:06] on the earth since that day until that
[1:31:08] and he said yet every time something
[1:31:10] took place Moses ran off to God and said
[1:31:12] Lord what must I do what must I do God
[1:31:15] kind of got tired of that I believe he
[1:31:17] said why are you crying to me
[1:31:20] speak and go forward my if any time ever
[1:31:25] look like they ought to retreat but
[1:31:27] there is never any retreat in
[1:31:32] God hallelujah God's not going to get
[1:31:34] right up to the end and back up and say
[1:31:36] I'm sorry I I'm I'm going to back off
[1:31:38] and no sir it's always move forward it's
[1:31:41] always take another step there is no
[1:31:44] place to retreat in God go forward the
[1:31:47] doctor says it's cancer go forward if he
[1:31:51] says it's TB go forward if the devil
[1:31:54] says you can't give this up go forward
[1:31:56] if your home says you're going your home
[1:31:58] said you're going to be a fanatic go
[1:31:59] forward if the church turns you out go
[1:32:02] forward there's no retreating back go
[1:32:06] forward speak and go forward speak what
[1:32:09] his
[1:32:11] word not our own ideas not what we think
[1:32:14] about it speak his word thus sayeth the
[1:32:17] Lord and move
[1:32:20] on speak the
[1:32:22] word amen the people rebelled and said
[1:32:26] had it not been better we died in Egypt
[1:32:28] been better we had our Graves Mark and
[1:32:31] from the highs and the vs now to pick
[1:32:32] our bones in the wilderness why did you
[1:32:35] bring us out here they had seen that God
[1:32:38] had approved Moses to be a servant they
[1:32:40] had seen all the visitations they had
[1:32:42] seen the plagues they had seen all of
[1:32:45] this and Moses said what must we do and
[1:32:48] the answer was go forward that's right
[1:32:53] go
[1:32:54] forward he said Moses was called for the
[1:32:57] job and he would do it he promised that
[1:33:00] he would send such a thing in that day
[1:33:01] to deliver them and God did that part
[1:33:04] sent Moses and the children of Israel
[1:33:06] just because little stumbles and things
[1:33:08] come along to try them they failed to
[1:33:10] march on with Moses Now isn't that just
[1:33:13] like today we see the message come forth
[1:33:15] we see the church rise to a place on the
[1:33:17] wings of the Holy Spirit under the power
[1:33:19] of God Thrills every person in there the
[1:33:21] glory of God Falls around and signs and
[1:33:23] wonders are taking place less than a
[1:33:25] week Satan is permitted to come into
[1:33:27] that congregation what does he do God
[1:33:29] permits it and then the church begins to
[1:33:30] mmor and fall back maybe it wasn't so
[1:33:33] there there's where we fail that's the
[1:33:35] failing of the church regardless of what
[1:33:38] takes place it's
[1:33:41] God move
[1:33:43] forward well there's some brother so and
[1:33:45] so I shot the victory with him and he's
[1:33:47] back no matter what he done has nothing

[1:33:57] those grounds amen you were there when
[1:34:00] the spirit came
[1:34:01] down it doesn't matter what anybody says
[1:34:05] he was there when he was pleased to
[1:34:06] dwell with us he was there when he
[1:34:11] spoke you were the guy at the burning
[1:34:16] bush what if the professors of Egypt
[1:34:18] what if Pharaoh would have said to Moses
[1:34:20] oh you just imagine you've seen a bush
[1:34:23] that was just roaring in your ears Moses
[1:34:25] knew where he stood Moses knew what
[1:34:28] talked to him and every man that's born
[1:34:32] of the spirit of God knows what talks to
[1:34:37] him when the Holy Ghost
[1:34:39] comes it speaks of peace that passes
[1:34:47] understanding Hallelujah think of it
[1:34:50] when God promises anything
[1:34:52] God will bring it to pass when God
[1:34:55] confirmed the word to you then believe
[1:34:59] it if it don't happen in the first five
[1:35:01] minutes believe it if it don't happen in
[1:35:04] the first day believe it if it don't
[1:35:06] happen in the first 20 years believe it
[1:35:09] anyhow amen if God spoke it it's going
[1:35:12] to come to pass he said in the last days
[1:35:14] he would pour out his Spirit upon All
[1:35:16] Flesh and your young men would see
[1:35:17] Visions old men would dream dreams upon
[1:35:19] my hands made and made service will I
[1:35:21] pour out my spirit and show signs in the
[1:35:24] heavens and the Earth great signs and
[1:35:25] wonders will take place in the last day
[1:35:27] and here we are in the last days and God
[1:35:29] is keeping his word the holy spirit is
[1:35:31] here and it vindicates that the coming
[1:35:33] of the Lord Jesus is near and people

[1:37:25] unless a water unless I thank God for it
[1:37:27] first that's where it is there's no
[1:37:30] retreat in
[1:37:32] God speak and go forward that's God's
[1:37:36] commission to his church we have no time
