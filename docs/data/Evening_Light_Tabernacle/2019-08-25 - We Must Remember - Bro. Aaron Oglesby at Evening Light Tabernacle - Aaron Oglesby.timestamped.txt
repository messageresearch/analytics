[42:01] and open with me to Psalms chapter 78 I
[42:07] have a little bit of a lengthy scripture
[42:10] wheat reading I don't have to pray that
[42:11] you'll just bear with me and stand
[42:13] through the reading of the word Psalms
[42:16] chapter 78 and we will we'll start right
[42:24] at verse 1 he says give ear o my people
[42:30] to my law incline your ears to the words
[42:34] of my mouth I will open my mouth in a
[42:38] parable I will utter dark sayings of old
[42:40] which we have heard and known and our
[42:43] fathers have told us we will not hide
[42:46] them from their children's showing to
[42:48] the generation to come the praises of
[42:51] the Lord and his strength and his
[42:53] wonderful works that he hath done for he
[42:56] established the testimony in Jacob and
[42:58] appointed a law in Israel which he
[43:00] commanded our fathers that they should
[43:02] make them known to their children that
[43:05] the generation to come might know them
[43:08] even the children which should be born
[43:10] who should arise and declare them to
[43:13] their children notice a theme right here
[43:14] he wants it repeated he wants it
[43:17] repeated he wants it told - that your
[43:20] children and your children's children he
[43:22] never wants his works or his word to
[43:25] ever be forgotten he wants it to go on
[43:27] for a generation after generation in
[43:30] verse eight it says and might not be as
[43:32] their fathers a stubborn and rebellious
[43:35] generation a generation that set not
[43:37] their
[43:37] heart all right and whose spirit was not
[43:40] steadfast with God the children of
[43:42] Ephraim Ephraim being armed and carrying
[43:45] bows turned back in the day of battle
[43:47] they kept not the Covenant of God and
[43:50] refused to walk in his law and forget
[43:53] his works and his wonders that he had
[43:56] showed them marvelous things he did in
[43:58] their sight of their fathers in the land
[44:00] of Egypt and in the field of Zola and so
[44:02] not only does he want you to remember
[44:05] he's pointing out certain people's that
[44:07] have already forgotten he's pointing out
[44:10] that even though I did so many amazing
[44:11] things in Egypt they forgot and so he's
[44:14] telling you remember today he's gonna
[44:17] tell you remember remember remember and
[44:20] never forget we're gonna keep reading
[44:22] verse 13 he divided the sea and caused
[44:25] them to pass through and he made the
[44:27] waters to stand as a heat in the daytime
[44:29] also he led them with a cloud and all
[44:32] the night with the light of fire he
[44:33] clave the rocks in the wilderness and
[44:35] gave them drink as out of the great
[44:37] depths he brought streams also out of
[44:39] the rock and caused waters to run down
[44:41] like rivers and they sinned yet more
[44:44] against him by provoking the most high
[44:46] in the wilderness and they tempted God
[44:49] in their heart by asking meat for their
[44:52] lust yea they spake against God and said
[44:54] can God furnish a table in the
[44:56] wilderness after everything he's done
[44:58] they said but can't he do this after
[45:01] everything he gave them they said but
[45:04] what about meat nothing he did was good
[45:07] enough for him and because it was not
[45:09] good enough for him they would forget it
[45:11] verse 20 behold he smoked the rock that
[45:15] their waters gushed out and the streams
[45:17] overflowed can he give bread also can he
[45:21] provide flesh for his people therefore
[45:24] the Lord heard this and was wroth so
[45:26] that a fire was kindled against Jacob
[45:28] and anger also came up against Israel
[45:30] because they believed not in God
[45:32] entrusted not in his salvation though he
[45:35] had commanded the clouds from above and
[45:37] opened the doors of heaven and had
[45:39] rained
[45:40] nana upon them to eat and had given them
[45:42] of the of the corn of heaven man did eat
[45:45] angels food he sent them meat to the
[45:49] fool may God bless you as you have your
[45:51] seat I'm a read from a to more places
[45:55] very briefly before we get started I'm
[45:57] gonna read one verse in Psalms chapter
[46:00] 20 I want to read verse 7 now we see
[46:03] what the children of Israel did we see
[46:07] that no matter what God did for them
[46:08] they would never remember and in Psalms
[46:12] chapter 20 verse 7 this is to be our
[46:15] testimony some trust in chariots some in
[46:20] horses but we will remember the name of
[46:24] the Lord our God Psalm 77 and 11 ah
[46:30] we'll remember the works of the Lord
[46:33] surely I will remember thy wonders of
[46:37] old this morning I want to encourage you
[46:40] to remember I'm gonna speak to you this
[46:43] morning our title today is we must
[46:46] remember last week I told you or two
[46:50] weeks ago when I ministered here I told
[46:51] you that I wanted to encourage you and
[46:53] and lift you up and and surely I believe
[46:55] the Word of God should always be
[46:56] encouraging no matter what we speak on
[46:58] but today I want to challenge you I want
[47:01] to challenge you that if you have
[47:02] forgotten today you must remember if you
[47:06] have forgotten what God has done for you
[47:08] today jog your memory wake up and
[47:10] realize he's been so very good to me we
[47:14] see right here that that victory comes
[47:17] through remembrance but failure comes
[47:20] through forgetting and that's how it's
[47:22] going to be our themes today victory
[47:24] comes through remembrance failure comes
[47:26] from forgetting and God hates to be
[47:29] forgotten God does not like to be
[47:32] forgotten when he's done so much when
[47:34] he's poured himself out and yet how
[47:36] easily we forget and you saw in our
[47:38] scripture reading how his anger burned
[47:40] within him and he was so frustrated
[47:41] because these were his children and
[47:43] we've all been there we know how it is
[47:45] when you feel like you've done so much
[47:47] for one of your children or you've
[47:49] you've given them so much maybe it's for
[47:52] for a special day and you go and you do
[47:54] all this stuff and at the end of the day
[47:55] they're pouty because they didn't get to
[47:57] do this one thing they wanted to do and
[47:59] how frustrated it makes you you feel
[48:02] like I gave and I gave and I gave and
[48:04] what I thought I would get was thank you
[48:06] so much what I thought I would get is I
[48:08] love you so much I appreciate it I know
[48:10] you gave so much thank you thank you
[48:12] thank you and instead you're like what's
[48:15] wrong well I thought we were going to do
[48:16] this and that is just a minor thing
[48:19] compared to what we're talking about
[48:21] we're the King of Kings laid aside his
[48:23] splendor laid aside his glory lay aside
[48:26] everything and came to be a man to take
[48:28] beatings for us to take whippings for us
[48:31] to take the cross for us and then we
[48:33] forget and say Lord my life it and what
[48:36] I wanted it to be imagine the pain that
[48:41] causes him the disappointment that
[48:43] causes him and we're going to be going a
[48:44] little bit slower today so just bear
[48:46] with me
[48:47] God hates to be forgotten and we live in
[48:50] a hyper busy tongue we live in a time in
[48:52] a world that's designed to keep you busy
[48:54] all the time every day it seems like
[48:57] that our schedules are packed to the max
[48:59] and it seems like we don't have time for
[49:01] anything and if we squeeze just one more
[49:03] thing in this day I'm just going to
[49:05] explode because I've already got so much
[49:06] to do so much to do and there's so much
[49:08] going on and it seems that we have more
[49:10] convenience than ever before but it
[49:12] seems like we're stretched for time more
[49:15] than we've ever been stretched before
[49:16] and I've often wondered how did people
[49:18] and in the days gone by how did they get
[49:21] everything done in a day I mean they
[49:23] didn't have a microwave they didn't have
[49:26] a zero-turn they didn't have these
[49:29] things to knock out all the the work and
[49:31] the chores and the just the basic things
[49:33] of life like we do and I've often
[49:35] wondered how did they get everything
[49:36] done and then I begun to think about how
[49:39] what I believe it is is that we do a lot
[49:41] of things that aren't necessarily things
[49:43] that we have to do we spend a lot of
[49:46] time chasing after things that aren't
[49:48] actually a necessity you come to realize
[49:50] that we do more than what's necessary
[49:52] and in times gone by before modern
[49:54] convenience they only had
[49:57] and they only focused on what their
[49:59] needs were why do I have to do today to
[50:01] put food on the table what do i have to
[50:04] do today to make sure there's a roof
[50:05] over our head why do I have to do today
[50:07] to make sure I have clothing and then
[50:09] focusing on that it gave them plenty of
[50:11] time to focus on and why do I have to do
[50:14] to make sure my family has a walk with
[50:16] the Lord why do I have time yeah what do
[50:18] I need to do today to make sure my
[50:20] children know that God is a living God
[50:22] what do I need to do today to make sure
[50:24] that the presence of God is welcome in
[50:26] my home and because they had time
[50:28] because they weren't focused on all the
[50:30] extra stuff they knew what was important
[50:32] in their life they needed food water and
[50:35] shelter and most importantly they needed
[50:37] the Lord Jesus they couldn't get by
[50:39] without the Lord Jesus but we've come to
[50:42] a point where everything so convenient
[50:43] how easy it is for us to forget him for
[50:46] a day or forget him for two days and
[50:48] then not remembering until trouble comes
[50:51] around us see I believe we live in a
[50:54] time where the lines between needs and
[50:58] wants have become blurred to where we
[51:02] spend a lot of time working for things
[51:04] that we want we spend a lot of time
[51:07] doing things that we want and then
[51:09] complaining that we don't have any time
[51:11] see I hear it all the time and I'm
[51:14] extremely guilty of this myself I really
[51:16] need to do this today I really need to
[51:20] get that today I don't have any time for
[51:22] this this week I have so much to do and
[51:25] so many of these things actually fall
[51:28] underneath the want category and they
[51:30] don't fall underneath the needs category
[51:32] now listen I'm not complaining I'm very
[51:35] thankful we live in a place where we
[51:37] have stuff I'm not complaining I'm not
[51:40] getting on to you I'm thankful that that
[51:42] we get to do fun stuff I'm thankful that
[51:45] I get to go on a vacation I'm thankful
[51:46] that I get to have hobbies but what I'm
[51:48] telling you is that those things in the
[51:50] pursuit of those things cannot be what
[51:52] consumes your life those things cannot
[51:55] be what consumes our life and our
[51:56] pursuit of pleasure in our quest for the
[51:58] things that we won't have we've
[52:00] forgotten what it is that we really need
[52:03] have we forgotten what it is that we
[52:05] really have Israel was /
[52:07] I did four on their journey in every
[52:09] single way imagine Allah imaginable but
[52:11] time after time after time they would
[52:13] forget time after time they would allow
[52:15] their walls to get in place of their
[52:18] needs the Lord was pouring out angel
[52:20] food for them and angels food and
[52:22] they're going but we won't meet this is
[52:24] angels food I've opened up the heavens
[52:26] and done something for you that I've
[52:28] never done for anybody your needs have
[52:31] been supplied yes Lord but this is what
[52:33] we want and we got to get to a point to
[52:37] where our wants and our needs are in
[52:39] there right in proper place it's okay to
[52:41] want stuff but the Lord said he would
[52:43] provide every one of your needs there
[52:48] are so many things right now that seems
[52:51] so important to us and young people you
[52:53] may not understand this yet and then the
[52:55] older you are you definitely understand
[52:58] this better I can remember well very
[53:01] well being a teenager and the things
[53:02] that I just had to have the things that
[53:04] I just needed so very much and yet all
[53:07] of its gonna pass away every bit of it
[53:09] is a vapor and and the reality of it is
[53:12] this morning you take everything you're
[53:14] sitting there on that bench thinking
[53:16] about whoever you are whatever your age
[53:17] is what you have need of your thinking I
[53:20] need to do this and tomorrow I need this
[53:21] and tomorrow at the end of the day let
[53:23] me tell you you only have need of one
[53:25] thing you need the Lord Jesus Christ at
[53:28] the end of the day you need a closer
[53:29] walk with the Lord
[53:31] you need a consecrated home we need
[53:33] consecrated Daddies that produce
[53:35] consecrated homes that produce cuts are
[53:37] created children that is truly our need
[53:40] today we need more of the Lord Jesus and
[53:43] we need less of the stuff we think we
[53:45] need and that's where we're at today but
[53:47] the world has been created in a place
[53:49] where there's stuff at our fingertips
[53:50] all the time and there's social media
[53:52] showing where this person is doing this
[53:54] and this person is doing this and this
[53:55] person got a new car god bless them I'm
[53:58] happy they got to do those things but it
[54:00] begins to weigh on our minds and why not
[54:02] me
[54:02] why am I getting to do that why don't I
[54:04] have a new vehicle Lord why don't I have
[54:07] more money Lord why don he's
[54:08] they're going after all I've done for
[54:10] you after all I've done for you and what
[54:12] you're gonna get back to me is a great
[54:14] what you're gonna get back to me is a
[54:15] focus on what you don't have remember
[54:18] today the Lord Jesus remember today what
[54:21] he's done for you in your life what we
[54:25] need to remember today is our calling
[54:27] what we need to remember is our purpose
[54:31] why are we here have we forgotten what
[54:36] we're really here for not to live
[54:37] through life not to perpetuate the ages
[54:39] not to have a good church service not to
[54:41] gather together and just have a good
[54:43] time have we forgotten why we're here
[54:44] have we forgotten our purpose and if you
[54:47] get nothing else out of this today I
[54:49] want you to remember why you were here
[54:52] you were here to serve the King of Kings
[54:54] you were here to serve the Lord of lords
[54:57] you've been called to be the very bride
[54:59] of Jesus Christ remember the Lord Jesus
[55:02] today
[55:03] you're going to hear that all through
[55:05] the service and you're gonna say man
[55:06] he's repeating that a lot but I want you
[55:07] to leave here today going I must
[55:10] remember I must remember the Lord I
[55:12] can't get caught up in the ends and outs
[55:14] of the word I can't get caught up in
[55:16] circumstances and forget the most
[55:18] important thing I can't get so focused
[55:20] on my pursuit of my dreams it's good to
[55:23] have dreams pursue your dreams but you
[55:24] better make sure that the Lord is in
[55:26] those dreams you matter make sure that
[55:28] it's the Lord's will you better make
[55:30] sure that he has the most important
[55:31] place in your life
[55:32] don't forget the Lord this morning
[55:36] listen working for a better life is good
[55:40] working to better your family's good
[55:42] working to better your education is good
[55:44] making sure your bills are paid that's
[55:46] good you better or next week you ain't
[55:49] have no lights it's important to make
[55:52] sure we take care of those things having
[55:54] hobbies having fun those things are good
[55:56] we're not we're not preaching about that
[55:58] but that cannot be what consumes us book
[56:01] of Luke chapter 21 verse 33 the Lord
[56:04] Jesus says heaven and earth shall pass
[56:07] away but my words shall not pass away so
[56:10] there's only one thing that's truly
[56:12] important there's only one thing that's
[56:14] not going to burn and that's his word
[56:16] and those who trusted in his word and
[56:19] those who remembered his word and those
[56:20] dudes stayed true to his word
[56:21] verse 34 and take heed to yourselves
[56:25] lest at any time your hearts be
[56:27] overcharged with surfeiting that's
[56:31] extreme living consuming too much
[56:34] partying things of that nature
[56:35] drunkenness and cares of this life so
[56:39] that they come upon you unawares for as
[56:42] a snare shall it come on all of them
[56:44] that dwell on the face of the whole
[56:46] earth
[56:47] we all have cares notice every single
[56:51] one of us has carriers of this life we
[56:52] all have jobs we all have as children to
[56:54] take care of we have things to do those
[56:55] are cares of life we all have a wife to
[56:58] take care of her a husband to take care
[56:59] of her a family to take care of
[57:01] we have things each and every day and
[57:02] those things are our cares now notice
[57:04] what are we to do with those cares he
[57:07] didn't say those cares were sinful but
[57:10] notice he said those things were just as
[57:12] dangerous as sinful things he mentioned
[57:15] sir fighting he mentioned drunkenness
[57:17] and then he said and the cares of life
[57:19] no the cares of life you would think
[57:21] well why are those things mention in
[57:23] with drunkenness why are those things
[57:25] mentioned in with sir fighting because
[57:26] he's telling you that is just as
[57:28] dangerous as sin if that's the thing
[57:32] that ensnares you if that's what in
[57:34] Snares your heart then it's just as
[57:36] dangerous as sin so so much it says that
[57:39] these things are so dangerous that
[57:41] there'll be a snare on to you so what do
[57:43] I do with these cares what do I do with
[57:45] these words if I know that they can
[57:46] snare me if I know that they can trap me
[57:48] yet I know that I'm consumed with them
[57:50] and I have them what am I to do with
[57:52] these well he gives us specific
[57:55] instructions on what to do with these
[57:56] cares if you look in first Peter chapter
[57:58] 5 and verse 6 he tells you exactly what
[58:01] did you are to do with your cares
[58:02] because we all have cares and we all
[58:04] have these things weighing down upon us
[58:06] and he says humble yourselves therefore
[58:07] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[58:11] exalt you in due time casting all your
[58:14] care upon him for he careth for you he
[58:18] says give all these things to him and
[58:21] let him sort them out too busy we're
[58:23] trying to sort out I want this I want
[58:24] this I need this I need I need I need I
[58:26] need and he's saying just give it off to
[58:27] me give it off to me I care for you
[58:30] which means I will
[58:31] you exactly what you have need of I'll
[58:33] look at these cares in decides which
[58:35] ones you really need and I'm going to
[58:36] trust his decision over my own decision
[58:39] my selfish flesh will say I need it all
[58:42] but the Lord says cast it all to me give
[58:45] me all your cares and then because I
[58:47] care for you I will give you exactly
[58:49] what it is you have need of first Peter
[58:52] five and eight we're continuing he says
[58:54] be sober be vigilant because your
[58:57] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[59:00] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[59:03] so he says give him your cares so that
[59:07] you can focus on the Lord Jesus because
[59:09] those who are not focused on the Lord
[59:11] Jesus are going to be devouring so you
[59:15] say my job is dangerous but not
[59:17] necessarily it can be a blessing but if
[59:20] it's what consumes you and it's all you
[59:21] think about and that's all you think day
[59:23] and night day and night which I don't
[59:25] know who would do that because when I
[59:26] leave work I'm done alright but some
[59:29] people get so consumed with things and
[59:31] he says he's walking about to consume
[59:34] whom he may devour if you don't lay it
[59:36] all at Jesus feet
[59:38] so today give him your cares focus on
[59:42] Christ notice those who focus is not on
[59:45] him are subject to the enemy's attack
[59:47] that's what I want us to remember this
[59:49] morning if your focus is not on him and
[59:51] you've forgotten him then you are
[59:52] subject to the enemy's attack
[1:00:03] listen this morning this is not a sermon
[1:00:05] against things they're sitting a sermon
[1:00:08] against your leisure time but what we're
[1:00:11] talking about is a world that has been
[1:00:13] designed to make you forget a world that
[1:00:17] has been designed to make you so busy an
[1:00:19] Eden of Satan that takes your time that
[1:00:22] fills every single minute with something
[1:00:23] to do that sends new battles at you
[1:00:25] every single day that put your focus on
[1:00:27] the trials and put your focus on the
[1:00:29] evils and Satan's job his one thing is
[1:00:32] to make you forget this man
[1:00:34] Satan is trying to make you forget with
[1:00:36] everything what the Lord has done for
[1:00:37] you where the Lord has brought you from
[1:00:39] Satan's job is to distort the truth and
[1:00:42] to point you to the circumstances
[1:00:44] because he knows that God hates to be
[1:00:47] forgotten see if we can if we can if he
[1:00:49] can get you this morning to forget about
[1:00:51] God's promises if he can get you this
[1:00:54] morning to forget all that God has
[1:00:55] already done for you in the past and he
[1:00:57] will begin to rob you of your victory
[1:00:59] because when you forget then the next
[1:01:01] thing that comes along with forgetting
[1:01:03] is doubt because you forget that he's
[1:01:04] already delivered you once and so when
[1:01:06] you face something you begin to doubt
[1:01:08] and then after a doubt comes unbelief
[1:01:10] and we know that you can't please the
[1:01:11] Lord if you're living in unbelief so if
[1:01:13] he can get you to forget what God has
[1:01:15] done for you this morning he's gonna rob
[1:01:17] you of your victory and he's gonna rob
[1:01:19] you of your worship he's gonna rob you
[1:01:22] of your prayer life and then unbelief
[1:01:24] and doubt and these things are soon
[1:01:25] gonna follow and it's time that we start
[1:01:28] to forget the things that should be
[1:01:30] forgotten and start to remember the
[1:01:32] things that should be remembered
[1:01:34] you know fraidy says in philippians
[1:01:36] verse three he says with one thing I do
[1:01:38] forgetting the things that are in the
[1:01:40] past forgetting those things I look
[1:01:42] towards the future I look to those
[1:01:44] things which are to come it's time that
[1:01:46] if we're gonna forget something we start
[1:01:48] forgetting things that should be
[1:01:49] forgotten if you're gonna forget
[1:01:50] something this morning how about you
[1:01:52] forget to love the enemy if you're going
[1:01:54] to forget something this morning how
[1:01:55] about you forget the devil in his past
[1:01:57] and all the things he's put on you how
[1:01:58] about you forget the life that you once
[1:02:00] live how about you forget your failures
[1:02:02] this morning and remember Jesus remember
[1:02:05] what
[1:02:05] done-for-you remember what he did for
[1:02:07] you in the past and then looking to that
[1:02:09] realizing he's faithful then look to the
[1:02:11] promises of the future forget what's in
[1:02:13] the past I realize I have a promise of
[1:02:15] healing have a promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:17] I have a promise of a rapture I have a
[1:02:19] promise that I've gone to prepare a
[1:02:21] place for you forget the things in the
[1:02:23] past forget the lies of the devil and
[1:02:25] look to the truth of God's Word this
[1:02:27] morning if we're gonna be forgetful
[1:02:29] forget the things that should be
[1:02:30] forgotten and remember the things that
[1:02:33] should be remembered remember every one
[1:02:35] of God's promises remember that they're
[1:02:37] true remember today that you've been
[1:02:40] bought with the price remember today
[1:02:42] that you're God's child remember today
[1:02:45] that he's worthy to be praised remember
[1:02:47] that he's done so very much for us how
[1:02:50] can we not praising how can we not give
[1:02:52] him our everything but you don't know my
[1:02:54] situation I don't but I know he's done
[1:02:57] so much for you I know he's done so much
[1:02:59] for this church every single one here
[1:03:01] today is a blessed person we have
[1:03:04] something to give him praise for
[1:03:06] remember he's worthy to be praised God
[1:03:10] loves to be remembered he hates it when
[1:03:13] we forget God has not a forgetful God
[1:03:16] himself although there are things that
[1:03:18] he chooses to forget
[1:03:19] thank God he chooses to forget our sins
[1:03:22] when we repent of them when we give him
[1:03:24] our sins and he forgets those things but
[1:03:26] when it comes to his promises to you
[1:03:27] when it comes to his people he said a
[1:03:30] mother may forget her child he said but
[1:03:32] I will never forget you I will never
[1:03:35] forget you and yet we so easily forget
[1:03:38] him
[1:03:39] how easily we forget our purpose how
[1:03:42] easily we forget our calling has the
[1:03:44] cares of this life begin to pile up all
[1:03:46] around us we must remember that we are
[1:03:49] called to be overcomers in this age we
[1:03:52] must remember that we're called to shine
[1:03:53] the light of a gospel to a dying world
[1:03:56] there are things we must remember this
[1:03:58] morn we're called to be the bride of
[1:03:59] Jesus Christ and what that calling comes
[1:04:01] a responsibility to remember we're
[1:04:04] called to take a rapture and yet
[1:04:07] sometimes when I hear the conversations
[1:04:09] of people and the things that maybe they
[1:04:13] desire or won't when I hear the things
[1:04:16] that stumble people
[1:04:18] when I hear the grippe and the
[1:04:20] complaints and you hear why this one
[1:04:23] quit or why that one quit or why this
[1:04:24] one's unhappy what this one doesn't like
[1:04:28] and why this person's grumbling I begin
[1:04:31] to wonder have we forgotten have we
[1:04:36] forgotten what it's really all about
[1:04:38] have we forgotten how much God has done
[1:04:41] for us have we forgotten what he's done
[1:04:44] for us even in this building and then go
[1:04:46] back to the old place in the years that
[1:04:48] his hand as God at us brother Craig the
[1:04:51] years his hands been upon your life the
[1:04:53] blessings that you've seen the blessings
[1:04:55] I've seen how can we forget that how can
[1:04:58] we look at a trial coming up and in the
[1:05:00] middle of something and go oh God are
[1:05:01] you able oh God
[1:05:04] what's going on God have you forgotten
[1:05:06] me how can we forget all that he's done
[1:05:10] as we see things creep back in we begin
[1:05:16] to see the world try to blend its way
[1:05:17] back in amongst our young people
[1:05:19] sometime amongst the old people you say
[1:05:22] have we forgotten have we forgotten the
[1:05:24] cry come out of her my people come out
[1:05:28] separate yourselves if you fail to
[1:05:31] separate yourselves don't you realize
[1:05:32] even if you're sitting in this church or
[1:05:34] whatever Church I don't care if it's
[1:05:35] Methodists or message if you haven't
[1:05:37] separated yourself then you're going to
[1:05:39] be protectors of the plague have you
[1:05:42] forgotten come out of her my people be
[1:05:44] separate saith the Lord we can't forget
[1:05:48] this brother Branham says how can we
[1:05:50] blend in with the day when God is so
[1:05:52] against the day he's called out this day
[1:05:57] the the he said it's past us they have
[1:06:00] grace it turned down the call of God
[1:06:02] there's been an indictment you can't
[1:06:05] blend in with something that's been
[1:06:06] indicted that makes you yourself guilty
[1:06:09] if we forget we'll be partakers and her
[1:06:12] plagues
[1:06:13] brother Branham says he will come in
[1:06:14] judgment upon the nation's and while he
[1:06:17] is being revealed in mercy Oh hurry you
[1:06:19] hither run quickly children get away
[1:06:22] from these man-made Babylonian
[1:06:24] theological walls of unbelief in cold
[1:06:26] formalism like I said I don't care what
[1:06:28] titles on your church door if it's man
[1:06:30] made Babylonian walls with cold
[1:06:32] formalism run away from it get away from
[1:06:34] that where light flows
[1:06:36] don't forget what he restored us back to
[1:06:38] in this day we must remember he says run
[1:06:41] away from man-made theology get out in
[1:06:43] the middle of the field in God's grace
[1:06:45] and there scream for mercy for it is his
[1:06:48] blood of his own son that gives the
[1:06:50] mercy to us get away from this old world
[1:06:52] of doubt get away from your
[1:06:53] superstitions accept God's message of
[1:06:56] mercy and his message of deliverance and
[1:06:58] flee to the middle of his grace and
[1:07:00] their scream O Jesus thou son of God
[1:07:02] have mercy on me others did it down
[1:07:09] through the ages many were willing to
[1:07:11] separate another stood before us we
[1:07:13] can't forget them brother Branham would
[1:07:16] point to it many times he said must I be
[1:07:18] carried to heaven on a flowery bed of
[1:07:20] ease while others fought to win the
[1:07:22] prize and sell through bloody seas have
[1:07:26] we forgotten who we are in this day look
[1:07:29] I know this is simple I'm very aware of
[1:07:33] it but last Sunday morning as I was
[1:07:35] getting ready for church I was going
[1:07:36] lord I don't know what I'm going to
[1:07:37] minister what thought it just struck me
[1:07:39] we must remember we must remember I was
[1:07:43] standing there in my home and I told
[1:07:45] Lydia Sheba asked me what are you going
[1:07:47] to preach I don't know
[1:07:47] well you're gonna freak I don't know I
[1:07:49] wish I knew and then I told her I said
[1:07:51] it just came to me and it hit me this is
[1:07:55] what the Lord wants you to hear this
[1:07:57] morning maybe I'm not doing it justice
[1:07:59] but we must remember you cannot forget
[1:08:02] what the Lord has done for you in this
[1:08:04] day what he's done for you have we
[1:08:07] forgotten who we are have we forgotten
[1:08:09] what the Lord has done for us have we
[1:08:12] forgotten Calvary there's a great danger
[1:08:17] in forgetting over and over again the
[1:08:19] scripture would tell you to remember
[1:08:22] remember remember it's all through the
[1:08:26] scriptures search the word remember it's
[1:08:28] a central theme in the scriptures
[1:08:29] remember remember brother Branham would
[1:08:32] say over and over again he would say he
[1:08:34] would use this statement he would say
[1:08:36] remember and never forget remember and
[1:08:39] never forget it's because forgive
[1:08:43] will lead you to defeat forgetting will
[1:08:46] lead you to defeat whereas remembering
[1:08:48] is going to bring victory even like
[1:08:50] Tabernacle this morning we must remember
[1:08:54] one God doesn't like to be forgotten -
[1:08:59] God hates complaining lord have mercy on
[1:09:04] me there's been many times in my life
[1:09:08] I've been a complainer lord have mercy
[1:09:11] on me because he's done so very much for
[1:09:15] us when we complain it makes it look as
[1:09:17] if what does it make it look as if it
[1:09:19] shows that we're ungrateful for what
[1:09:21] he's done when we complain and griping
[1:09:24] and it's an indication that you've
[1:09:26] forgotten if you're complaining you're
[1:09:28] saying Lord your blessings on me are not
[1:09:30] enough the things you have done for me
[1:09:33] Lord they're not enough His goodness is
[1:09:35] not enough his miracles is not enough
[1:09:37] and it's really at the end of the day
[1:09:39] it's a slap in the face to God Israel
[1:09:43] had a problem they were on this vicious
[1:09:44] cycle of forgetting complaining
[1:09:46] forgetting complaining forgetting
[1:09:48] complaining and you find it it's almost
[1:09:49] a theme of the Old Testament as they
[1:09:51] journey to the promised land forget
[1:09:53] complain forget complain and they're on
[1:09:55] a journey exactly like the one we're on
[1:09:57] and in the journey there's going to be
[1:09:59] times where unexpected things come upon
[1:10:01] your life listen brother Tim has a
[1:10:03] saying he says you know heathens have
[1:10:05] flat tires - no that's not how he says
[1:10:07] it
[1:10:07] Christians have flat tires - I totally
[1:10:09] messed that up Christians have flat
[1:10:13] tires - heathens - that's great
[1:10:17] Christians have flat tires - in other
[1:10:20] words we are not immune to problems of
[1:10:22] life we're not immune to one day getting
[1:10:25] in a situation that we don't know how to
[1:10:27] handle as a matter of fact if we would
[1:10:29] get ourselves to the place that we
[1:10:30] realized we don't know how to handle
[1:10:31] anything we'd be much better off because
[1:10:33] as soon as we walked into that situation
[1:10:35] and we hit that moment instead of trying
[1:10:37] to figure it out instead of trying to
[1:10:38] fix it ourselves we would instantly cast
[1:10:40] our cares upon Jesus and we would be way
[1:10:43] better off because he would figure it
[1:10:44] out a lot better than you could and I
[1:10:47] promise you you would always live in the
[1:10:48] will
[1:10:49] the Lord if you gave everything to him
[1:10:50] but instead we always try to figure it
[1:10:52] out so when we hit something we didn't
[1:10:54] expect when we hit something we look at
[1:10:56] as a problem it's why me Lord why is
[1:10:58] this going on in my life how come this
[1:11:01] is happening and Lord why didn't you
[1:11:02] forewarn me of this and why and why and
[1:11:05] why and you've forgotten that the last
[1:11:07] time you hit a situation like that he
[1:11:09] delivered you out of it you've forgotten
[1:11:11] that the last time you were down in a
[1:11:12] ditch like that he pulled you out of it
[1:11:14] we've forgotten that his grace is
[1:11:16] sufficient we've forgotten that no
[1:11:18] matter what's going on around us he's
[1:11:20] going to see you through he has not
[1:11:22] forgotten you you are his people he can
[1:11:25] never forget you just trust in the Lord
[1:11:27] and remember they're going to journey
[1:11:31] and we know that there's going to be
[1:11:33] hardships and trials but hasn't he
[1:11:36] already done enough that if he never
[1:11:38] does another thing in your life you
[1:11:40] should be able to remember and thank him
[1:11:41] for it Israel had a front-row seat it's
[1:11:46] one of the most powerful outpourings of
[1:11:48] God that ever hit the face of the earth
[1:11:50] they were there in the land of Egypt and
[1:11:53] they witnessed the actual power of the
[1:11:56] spoken word as a man would call for
[1:11:59] flies brother Branham said there might
[1:12:02] not be a fly in the country and a few
[1:12:04] minutes later there's one little green
[1:12:05] fly and then next thing you know he said
[1:12:08] something like five pounds a square yard
[1:12:10] or something I'll remember the exact
[1:12:11] number but they witnessed they witnessed
[1:12:13] him speaking call for frogs they
[1:12:16] witnessed these things they witnessed
[1:12:17] that the the hell and they witnessed yet
[1:12:20] the plagues that fell upon the cattle
[1:12:22] they witnessed the river turned to blood
[1:12:23] they witnessed all these things they saw
[1:12:26] every bit of it with their own eyes
[1:12:28] they they realized that here we are in
[1:12:30] Goshen right there all these things are
[1:12:32] falling and none of us even touching us
[1:12:34] I'm sure it was a common talking around
[1:12:37] the table can you believe this brother
[1:12:38] Craig once again God spoke and it's
[1:12:40] striking our enemies isn't God good
[1:12:42] isn't God wonderful he's delivering us
[1:12:45] isn't God good this is amazing and they
[1:12:49] saw as their God brought Pharaoh in
[1:12:51] Egypt to its knees they witnessed the
[1:12:53] most powerful world or country in the
[1:12:56] world be brought down and left in
[1:12:57] absolute
[1:12:58] shambles they had a front-row seat to
[1:13:01] this and they may march out of Egypt and
[1:13:03] their testimony is God is good god is
[1:13:06] wonderful our god is great God is mighty
[1:13:08] wondrous are his works
[1:13:10] oh we love you God you're so good to us
[1:13:13] you're soulless you're so great you're
[1:13:15] so wonderful how we appreciate you Lord
[1:13:18] and they started out and their initial
[1:13:21] response to this the spectacular
[1:13:23] deliverance from Egypt starts out as
[1:13:26] praise and you remember when God saved
[1:13:28] you when he first called you out how you
[1:13:33] just couldn't wait to talk to him thank
[1:13:35] you Jesus
[1:13:36] you couldn't wait to be in the house of
[1:13:38] God you couldn't wait to worship the
[1:13:42] music would start playing and you would
[1:13:43] just begin to feel just relaxed that the
[1:13:46] cares of the world would fade away and
[1:13:48] that's how they start out out of Egypt
[1:13:50] god you're so good and their praise and
[1:13:52] worship wholehearted trust and yet it
[1:13:55] doesn't take but a few days and it's
[1:13:57] grumbling complaining murmuring
[1:14:00] quarreling Moses where's the meat we're
[1:14:05] supposed to eat Moses who put you in
[1:14:09] charge
[1:14:10] Moses there's no water here have you
[1:14:14] forgotten
[1:14:15] have you forgotten already spiritual
[1:14:20] amnesia can take takes complete control
[1:14:22] of them covers over their eyes and so
[1:14:24] soon they forgot God's gracious and
[1:14:27] miraculous deliverance we're literally
[1:14:29] days away from them leaving Egypt when
[1:14:32] they come to the Red Sea you know we
[1:14:36] read this and through our eyes
[1:14:37] you look at the people of Israel and if
[1:14:40] you're anything like me you look at me
[1:14:42] go how could how could they not
[1:14:47] realizing how guilty we are of the same
[1:14:49] thing
[1:14:50] how could they possibly do that and
[1:14:52] guilty of it ourselves Exodus 14 and 10
[1:14:57] and when Pharaoh drew nigh the children
[1:15:00] of Israel lifted up their eyes and
[1:15:01] behold the Egyptians marched after them
[1:15:04] and they were sore afraid and the
[1:15:06] children of Israel cried out unto the
[1:15:08] Lord now if you read that Scripture and
[1:15:11] it was a standalone Scripture I don't
[1:15:14] think I'd have a problem with it they
[1:15:16] cried out to the Lord if you stopped
[1:15:19] right there does that mean they said
[1:15:21] Lord we know what you did in Egypt
[1:15:23] we're crying out to you now to once
[1:15:25] again bring your mighty deliverance
[1:15:26] we're crying out to you Lord right now
[1:15:29] to strike down Pharaoh once again we
[1:15:31] trust you Lord we know that just days
[1:15:33] ago you delivered us from his hand we
[1:15:35] trust you lord thank you Lord Jesus is
[1:15:38] that what it means by cried out to the
[1:15:40] Lord there nope next verse and they said
[1:15:46] unto Moses because there were no graves
[1:15:48] in Egypt has thou taken us away to die
[1:15:50] in the wilderness wherefore hast thou
[1:15:53] dealt dust with us to carry us forth out
[1:15:56] of Egypt is not this the word that we
[1:16:00] did tell thee in Egypt saying let us
[1:16:01] alone that we may serve the Egyptians
[1:16:03] for it had been better for us to serve
[1:16:06] the Egyptians that we should die in the
[1:16:09] wilderness my didn't we tell you just
[1:16:14] leave us alone then we tell you a
[1:16:16] preacher to get off our back didn't we
[1:16:19] tell you to stay off those worldly
[1:16:20] pleasures and the things we like to do
[1:16:22] in our TV and all this stuff did we tell
[1:16:24] you to stay off our music why'd you pull
[1:16:27] us out of that now we're hearing I'm
[1:16:29] bored all the time but I got nothing to
[1:16:31] do why didn't you just let me die back
[1:16:32] there in the world why you preach this
[1:16:36] clotheslined religion why don't you just
[1:16:37] get off our back didn't we tell you to
[1:16:39] leave us alone the amazing thing about
[1:16:45] this is in the midst of all this God
[1:16:48] moved
[1:16:51] what a merciful God in the midst of
[1:16:55] their griping in the midst of their
[1:16:56] complaining God move
[1:16:58] surely this jogged their memory sure
[1:17:01] that's how God we're so sorry that'll
[1:17:03] never happen again
[1:17:05] it was a mistake sure twas they they
[1:17:07] messed up but God moved because of his
[1:17:08] goodness Exodus 15 23 and when they came
[1:17:13] tomorrow they could not drink of the
[1:17:15] waters of Marah for they were bitter
[1:17:17] therefore the name of it was called
[1:17:19] Marah and the people murmured against
[1:17:22] Moses saying what shall we drink and God
[1:17:26] moved once again he moved in spite of
[1:17:30] the people and even like tabernacle may
[1:17:33] he never move in spite of us but may he
[1:17:35] move because we've invited him to move
[1:17:37] may he move because he feels welcome
[1:17:39] here may he move because we come here
[1:17:41] knowing what he's done knowing what he's
[1:17:43] gonna do and we begin to enter into
[1:17:44] worship we begin to give him our praise
[1:17:46] and we can say God it's been a rough
[1:17:48] week but I know who can fix that for me
[1:17:50] I've had a bad day but I know where I
[1:17:52] can cast my cares at this morning and
[1:17:54] then allow God to move not having move
[1:17:57] in spite of you but move because of you
[1:18:00] because you created an atmosphere and
[1:18:01] invite him into this place and say Lord
[1:18:03] God move upon my life Lord moving
[1:18:05] changed me change my attitude may the
[1:18:08] atmosphere around me affect others may
[1:18:10] we never get so cold and formal that a
[1:18:12] devil can rest on somebody and feel
[1:18:14] comfortable sitting next to you but may
[1:18:16] you soul enter in and so worship that
[1:18:18] the demons begin to feel uncomfortable
[1:18:20] and God can move and deal with hearts
[1:18:22] and the demons can be run out of this
[1:18:24] place and that can be victory in the
[1:18:25] house of God because we remember what
[1:18:27] God's done for us because we haven't
[1:18:29] forgot what he's done for us because he
[1:18:31] doesn't have to move around us and go
[1:18:32] home for us to make things happen how
[1:18:35] many times is he right there waiting to
[1:18:37] break forth across the audience but
[1:18:39] somebody's attitudes wrong and he has
[1:18:41] the whole back he's waiting to break
[1:18:44] forth and save a life but your attitudes
[1:18:46] wrong you've forgotten and it hinders
[1:18:48] the moving of the Spirit God forgive us
[1:18:52] of that
[1:18:54] we must remember exodus 16 - in the
[1:19:01] whole congregation of the children of
[1:19:03] Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron
[1:19:05] in the wilderness and the children of
[1:19:07] Israel said and they would to God we had
[1:19:09] died by the hand of the Lord in the land
[1:19:10] of Egypt when we set by the fleshpots
[1:19:13] and when we did eat bread to the fool
[1:19:15] for you have brought us forth into this
[1:19:17] wilderness to kill this whole assembly
[1:19:19] with hunger then said the Lord unto
[1:19:22] Moses behold I will rain bread from
[1:19:24] heaven for you when God moved again God
[1:19:30] moved Exodus 17 3 and the people
[1:19:35] thirsted there for water and the people
[1:19:37] murmured against Moses and said
[1:19:38] wherefore is this that thou has brought
[1:19:41] us up out of Egypt to kill us and our
[1:19:42] children and our cattle with thirst and
[1:19:45] God moved time after time we could go on
[1:19:48] on and on and on in their journey and
[1:19:51] every time God would move until God
[1:19:55] couldn't stand it anymore
[1:19:57] their forgetfulness and their
[1:19:59] ungratefulness eventually he just said
[1:20:01] that's enough
[1:20:02] his anger began to rise up within him
[1:20:04] and he had all that he could take and it
[1:20:06] tells us in numbers 11 verse 1 and when
[1:20:09] the people complained it displeased the
[1:20:12] Lord remember this this morning when you
[1:20:15] get into a tough spot and you begin to
[1:20:18] complain it displeased the Lord and the
[1:20:22] Lord heard it and his anger was kindled
[1:20:24] and the fire of the Lord burnt amongst
[1:20:26] them and consumed them that were in the
[1:20:28] uttermost parts of the camp they're
[1:20:30] complaining caused the fire of God to
[1:20:32] come down and burn them up it consumed
[1:20:34] him they witnessed this with their own
[1:20:36] eyes they witnessed what happened when
[1:20:39] you complain and grumble and get outside
[1:20:41] the camp and leave the church and they
[1:20:43] sit there and watched as some walked
[1:20:44] away and their lives fell apart into
[1:20:46] shambles and it was an example to us Oh
[1:20:49] that'll never happen okay we're never
[1:20:53] gonna let that happen again
[1:20:54] and they forgot
[1:20:58] surely they won't forget now they just
[1:21:00] watch people burn alive because they
[1:21:02] were complaining they witnessed it
[1:21:04] numbers 14 1 and all the congregation
[1:21:07] lifted up their voice and cried and the
[1:21:10] people wept that night and all the
[1:21:12] children of Israel murmured against
[1:21:14] Moses and against Aaron and the whole
[1:21:15] congregation said unto them what God
[1:21:17] that we have died in the land of Egypt
[1:21:19] or what God we had died in the
[1:21:21] wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord
[1:21:24] brought us unto this land to fall by the
[1:21:26] sword that our wives and our children
[1:21:27] should be a prey were not better for us
[1:21:30] to return to Egypt and they said one to
[1:21:32] another let us make a captain and let us
[1:21:34] return to Egypt until his Lord finally
[1:21:38] had enough and he's going to wipe the
[1:21:40] whole people off the face of the earth
[1:21:43] but in Moses we know he intercedes and
[1:21:46] we find in numbers 14 11 it says and the
[1:21:49] Lord said unto Moses how long will this
[1:21:51] people provoke me how long will it be
[1:21:53] err they believe me for all the signs
[1:21:56] which have showed among them make this
[1:21:59] personal this morning for all the signs
[1:22:02] which I've showed among them I will
[1:22:05] smite them with the pestilence and
[1:22:07] disinherit them and will make of thee a
[1:22:09] great nation and mightier than they skip
[1:22:13] down to verse 20 says and the Lord said
[1:22:16] I have pardoned according to thy word
[1:22:18] but as truly as I live all the earth
[1:22:21] shall be filled with the glory of God
[1:22:22] because all those men which have seen my
[1:22:25] glory and my miracles which I did in
[1:22:26] Egypt and in the wilderness have tempted
[1:22:28] me now these 10 times and have not
[1:22:30] hearkened to my voice surely they shall
[1:22:34] not see the land which I swear unto
[1:22:36] their fathers neither shall any of them
[1:22:38] that provoked me see it
[1:22:41] forgetting God as a big deal forgetting
[1:22:45] his works is a big deal crying out and
[1:22:49] complaining and in the midst of all God
[1:22:51] has done for us God hates it to the
[1:22:53] point he said not one of them will enter
[1:22:56] into the promised land
[1:22:59] jesus said every one of them are dead
[1:23:01] and brother Brandon picked that up and
[1:23:04] said that means eternally separated from
[1:23:06] God every one of them eternally
[1:23:09] separated from God because they forget
[1:23:12] they were ungrateful they didn't
[1:23:15] remember the Lord they didn't remember
[1:23:17] his mighty works so finally the Lord
[1:23:20] cries out how long repeatedly time after
[1:23:24] time the Lord had demonstrated his
[1:23:25] faithfulness in every single situation
[1:23:27] however as soon as they would encounter
[1:23:30] another trial they would instantly
[1:23:32] forget the victory that they had just
[1:23:33] had they had seen enough in Egypt that
[1:23:36] if God never did another thing for them
[1:23:38] they should have never complained
[1:23:41] if they had been trapped at the Red Sea
[1:23:44] and he didn't move they still should
[1:23:46] have been able to praise him for the
[1:23:48] things that he did for them in Egypt
[1:23:49] not every single situation you face is
[1:23:52] gonna work out exactly the way you think
[1:23:54] it should he's not always just gonna
[1:23:56] wipe it away and let you walk through
[1:23:58] just perfectly there's times we go
[1:24:00] through battles but it's he that gives
[1:24:03] the victory don't complain about the
[1:24:05] fact you were in a battle rejoice
[1:24:06] because you've got the victory you're
[1:24:08] gonna fight battles that's part of the
[1:24:10] journey we're in and yet how quickly
[1:24:12] they forgotten Church I'm telling you
[1:24:14] today how much should we remember what
[1:24:17] God has done in our midst how victorious
[1:24:20] our lives ought to be how what
[1:24:21] overcomers we should be with all that
[1:24:24] God has done for us here at evening
[1:24:25] lights haver not going abroad around the
[1:24:27] world but I'm speaking to you this
[1:24:28] morning even light tabernacle the things
[1:24:30] we've witnessed in this building there's
[1:24:32] not a person in here that should ever
[1:24:33] doubt again there's not a person in here
[1:24:35] who has a right to complain ever again
[1:24:37] there's not anybody in here he's done
[1:24:39] enough in this congregation that we
[1:24:42] should always remember the Lord he's
[1:24:44] done enough in this congregation that we
[1:24:45] can lift our hands to him and praise Him
[1:24:47] and say Lord you are wonderful Lord you
[1:24:50] are mighty Lord you have been good to me
[1:24:52] Lord you saved my soul Lord I'm unworthy
[1:24:55] but you're worthy this morning and you
[1:24:57] deserve all the praise and honor you
[1:24:59] deserve me to remember you but sometimes
[1:25:07] in service I'm not saying anything ugly
[1:25:10] yo y'all forgive me but sometimes in
[1:25:13] service I see people who have forgotten
[1:25:17] sometimes when the praise and the
[1:25:19] worship is going forth then you look out
[1:25:21] across the faces you see people who have
[1:25:24] forgot
[1:25:26] you see people that forget that God
[1:25:29] deserves everything no matter what your
[1:25:31] day was like we see that people forget
[1:25:35] that we're praising a God who has given
[1:25:37] his everything and yet the praise that
[1:25:41] you're giving doesn't match what he
[1:25:43] deserves
[1:25:44] now I realize that no amount of praise
[1:25:47] could ever equal what he truly deserves
[1:25:49] but I believe we have an obligation to
[1:25:51] give them every single thing we have and
[1:25:55] if you can sit there today as I'm
[1:25:57] preaching this and you go you know what
[1:25:59] I agree with that and I'm not guilty
[1:26:02] because every service I'm ever in I sing
[1:26:05] with everything I have I respond with
[1:26:08] everything I have my mind stays focus
[1:26:12] with everything I have I hang on every
[1:26:14] word then that's what we're looking for
[1:26:16] but if you're sitting there today and
[1:26:19] you know I haven't given him everything
[1:26:22] in every service I haven't always gave
[1:26:26] my all then this morning we got to
[1:26:29] remember God's not fixing to come down
[1:26:34] and and consume you was fired this
[1:26:36] morning because you didn't sing in the
[1:26:37] song service I said please don't think
[1:26:39] that's what I'm telling you but we saw
[1:26:41] when they forgot God was merciful and
[1:26:44] God moved and I'm telling you he's
[1:26:47] merciful this morning but he wants you
[1:26:48] to remember he wants you to praise he
[1:26:51] wants you to give him every single thing
[1:26:53] that you can possibly give him Church if
[1:26:56] we truly remembered think about how we
[1:26:59] would worship if we truly remember think
[1:27:03] about all you would pour into it if you
[1:27:05] remember what you were and you remember
[1:27:09] what he's made you if you remember where
[1:27:12] you were going but now you know your
[1:27:14] destination in the future how can you
[1:27:16] not give him praise and you think about
[1:27:19] the times he healed you when you were
[1:27:20] sick he delivered you when you were
[1:27:22] bound how can you not give him praise
[1:27:23] this morning
[1:27:24] how can we forget where he's brought us
[1:27:26] from if you're saved then you can
[1:27:29] worship when you were set free you can
[1:27:31] worship and yet there's still many
[1:27:33] sitting there Wade
[1:27:35] by slave mentality you're not a slave
[1:27:38] anymore you've been set free but you're
[1:27:41] learning yourself to be held by broken
[1:27:43] chains we heard Wednesday that you
[1:27:45] shouldn't be held by broken chains but
[1:27:47] you're still sitting there and those
[1:27:48] chains are weighing you down and you
[1:27:50] haven't come to that realization that
[1:27:51] I'm free the devil doesn't have a hold
[1:27:54] on me anymore
[1:27:55] God has paid the price he's gone to
[1:27:57] prepare a place for me he's sending a
[1:27:59] rapture for me he's provided healing for
[1:28:01] me he's gonna save my children and if
[1:28:03] you really understand that if you really
[1:28:05] believe that there's no possible way you
[1:28:07] can sit in a service and not worship the
[1:28:10] king of kings and the Lord of lords it
[1:28:12] would be impossible it's not possible to
[1:28:17] be a believer and sit in church and not
[1:28:19] worship it is impossible it is
[1:28:24] impossible well I don't worship you're
[1:28:26] not a believer
[1:28:40] you got to remember that you're free
[1:28:43] this morning you got to remember
[1:28:45] everything he's done for you and you got
[1:28:48] to remember he deserves your praise you
[1:28:52] got to remember that you saw your
[1:28:54] taskmasters floating in the Red Sea
[1:28:56] remember that you saw them floating in
[1:28:58] the Red Sea or have you forgotten why
[1:29:03] can't you worship why are you not
[1:29:05] content in life as the scripture tells
[1:29:07] us to be is he not enough
[1:29:09] has he not blessed you enough has he not
[1:29:11] done enough oh lord I know you've
[1:29:13] forgiven my sins I know you've done so
[1:29:15] much for me I know you healed me I know
[1:29:17] you delivered me but things are tough
[1:29:18] right now really I know you've done so
[1:29:22] much for me Lord but we're struggling
[1:29:23] financially I know you've done so much
[1:29:26] for me but I'm down about where my life
[1:29:28] is and the prospects of my life
[1:29:29] I'm down because I thought my life would
[1:29:31] be better than this it is very provoking
[1:29:34] to God to undervalue the things he gives
[1:29:36] you it is very provoking to God to
[1:29:40] undervalue his blessings and the things
[1:29:42] he has poured out upon your life to
[1:29:44] undervalue His mercies and undervalue
[1:29:46] his provision provisions well I only
[1:29:49] have this and we only have that and I'm
[1:29:52] in this situation and I only have this
[1:29:55] ok Israel we only have manna we only
[1:30:00] have this look angels food wasn't good
[1:30:02] enough for them either what does he have
[1:30:04] to do to be good enough for you what
[1:30:07] does he have to do I say he doesn't have
[1:30:09] to do another thing I say he's poured
[1:30:11] out his blessings more than enough I say
[1:30:13] if he never did anything else after
[1:30:14] Calvary he's done more than enough for
[1:30:16] you that you can praise Him through all
[1:30:19] eternity but you got to remember what he
[1:30:21] did for you you cannot forget Israel
[1:30:27] said yeah well I wish we had meat I wish
[1:30:30] we had fishing garlic Israel have you
[1:30:35] forgotten brother Brown says it's fine
[1:30:39] that God has so fixed this earth that we
[1:30:41] can all be happy if we would just try to
[1:30:45] be that way we can all be happy if we
[1:30:50] would just try to be that way
[1:30:52] so I'm just gonna take what he said and
[1:30:55] say so if you're not happy you're not
[1:30:58] try if we would try to be that way live
[1:31:04] happily and be thankful to him for what
[1:31:07] we have I'm quite sure that one of the
[1:31:10] great faults with us is that we're not
[1:31:12] grateful enough for what we have he has
[1:31:15] been so good to us to give us so many
[1:31:17] things and we just don't seem to
[1:31:20] appreciate it as much as we should see
[1:31:27] grumbling and thankless Nizar not a
[1:31:34] response to your circumstance if you
[1:31:38] grumble and complain
[1:31:40] you're not grumbling and complaining to
[1:31:42] your circumstance you're grumbling and
[1:31:43] complaining to God understand that
[1:31:47] grumbling and complaining is not a
[1:31:49] response to your circumstance it is a
[1:31:51] complaint to God Israel grumbled when
[1:31:54] they were slaves Israel grumbled when
[1:31:57] Moses showed up Israel murmured and
[1:32:00] grumbled on the way to the promised land
[1:32:01] see the grumbling was in their heart it
[1:32:04] had nothing to do with their
[1:32:05] surroundings it had nothing to do with
[1:32:08] their current situation because it
[1:32:10] didn't matter what situation you found
[1:32:11] them in they were complaining they were
[1:32:14] grumbling they were upset so it had
[1:32:16] nothing to do with the current situation
[1:32:18] the complaint in the grumbling is in
[1:32:20] your heart because you don't recognize
[1:32:22] what God has done for you you don't
[1:32:23] remember how good he is so nothing's
[1:32:26] ever quite good enough and there's
[1:32:28] always a grumble and there's always a
[1:32:29] complain your attitude towards God
[1:32:31] should not be rooted in a bank account
[1:32:33] it should not be rooted in your current
[1:32:35] health condition it should not be rooted
[1:32:37] in your current state of affairs it
[1:32:39] should not be rooted in your job
[1:32:40] condition because just as grumbling is a
[1:32:42] reflection of your heart so as a life
[1:32:45] filled with praise a reflection of your
[1:32:47] heart so today my attitude towards God
[1:32:50] it's not on my bank account not on my
[1:32:52] job situation but my attitude towards
[1:32:54] God is because I remember what
[1:32:56] God has done for me my heart cries out
[1:32:59] Lord you are worthy of my praise I may
[1:33:01] be sick today but you're worthy of my
[1:33:03] praise I lost my job today you're worthy
[1:33:05] of my praise my children are sick Lord
[1:33:08] you're worthy of my praise because I
[1:33:10] remember I was lost I was bound for hell
[1:33:12] you came to Calvary and your
[1:33:14] precious blood
[1:33:15] I will remember today Lord Jesus I will
[1:33:18] praise the king of kings
[1:33:19] I will lift up the name above names
[1:33:21] because you're worthy regardless of my
[1:33:24] circumstance and that's a reflection of
[1:33:26] the heart because he sits there and I
[1:33:29] can't keep quiet I can't not praise him
[1:33:31] but look at Joe look at Jobe you have
[1:33:34] not had a day quite like job but he
[1:33:37] praised him anyhow and when people just
[1:33:40] said curse God and I said you speak as a
[1:33:42] foolish woman his circumstances never
[1:33:45] determined his attitude because it's a
[1:33:48] reflection of your heart we are to
[1:33:53] remember I don't want to believe there's
[1:33:58] anybody sitting here today that's lost I
[1:34:00] don't believe it I know there's three
[1:34:04] kinds of believers but I choose to
[1:34:05] believe each and every one of you will
[1:34:07] be there it's up to you and the Lord to
[1:34:12] work that out I choose to believe that
[1:34:15] we're believers I don't believe there's
[1:34:17] anybody here lost so if you're saved and
[1:34:22] if you're free then you know what
[1:34:25] happened in your life then how can you
[1:34:28] not give every single moment in a church
[1:34:31] service everything you've got why are
[1:34:34] you harping on church services well I'll
[1:34:35] put it to you like this I know it's not
[1:34:37] supposed to be just in church it's
[1:34:38] supposed to be every day your life but
[1:34:40] if you're not giving it your all for an
[1:34:42] hour and a half on Wednesday and a
[1:34:43] couple hours on Sunday I don't even got
[1:34:44] worried about what's going on the rest
[1:34:45] of the week if you're not giving it your
[1:34:50] all on Wednesday and Sunday I don't even
[1:34:51] got worried about what you're doing the
[1:34:52] rest of the week because you definitely
[1:34:53] ain't giving it your all if you can come
[1:34:57] in and sit down on God when his presence
[1:34:59] is moving I know you sit down on him
[1:35:00] when you're all alone and you can't
[1:35:02] feeling
[1:35:03] when works hard and when your minds off
[1:35:05] him I know you're not giving it if you
[1:35:07] can't pour it out in this atmosphere
[1:35:09] if you can't pour it out when he's
[1:35:11] moving amongst his people then I'm not
[1:35:14] even giving thought to what goes on the
[1:35:17] rest of the week if you're saved how can
[1:35:19] you not praise Him how can you not give
[1:35:22] him everything when he's given
[1:35:23] everything for you if you can't praise
[1:35:26] him it's because you've forgotten and I
[1:35:29] want to challenge you this morning to
[1:35:31] remember don't walk away and say brother
[1:35:35] Aaron said I'm lost I'm not saying that
[1:35:36] I'm telling you to remember this morning
[1:35:38] shake your memory shake your
[1:35:40] consciousness look back at what God has
[1:35:41] done when you see he's always been
[1:35:43] faithful then look ahead to the other
[1:35:44] promises and go I know he'll be faithful
[1:35:46] there and because he's faithful he
[1:35:48] deserves my praise God hates his works
[1:35:53] to be forgotten forgetfulness brings
[1:35:58] lukewarmness forgetfulness brings death
[1:36:01] and he hates for his works to be
[1:36:03] forgotten and he hates it also when they
[1:36:06] become common to us they should never
[1:36:08] become common to us and and he has
[1:36:11] constantly reminded Israel of his
[1:36:13] deliverance telling them to rehearse it
[1:36:16] and teach their children teach their
[1:36:17] children exodus 13 and 3 and moses said
[1:36:20] unto the people remember this day in
[1:36:22] which you came out from Egypt out of the
[1:36:24] house of bondage for by strength of hand
[1:36:27] and the Lord brought you out from this
[1:36:29] place remember this day Deuteronomy 15
[1:36:34] and excuse me fit 5 and 15 and remember
[1:36:37] that that was a servant in the land of
[1:36:39] Egypt and that the LORD thy God brought
[1:36:41] the out thence through a mighty hand and
[1:36:44] by stretched out arm and then he
[1:36:46] implements feast and and celebrations
[1:36:51] and all of them are with the purpose of
[1:36:54] remembering every single thing that he
[1:36:56] implements for the children admitted
[1:36:58] Israel is for the purpose of remembering
[1:37:00] an event so that they would never forget
[1:37:03] because look God understands there's one
[1:37:05] place in Psalm 78 where he goes on and
[1:37:08] on and on about how awful they've been
[1:37:10] and then it says in the middle there but
[1:37:12] he remembered that they were just flesh
[1:37:14] as human beings we
[1:37:16] have times where we forget we have times
[1:37:19] where we get distracted it says he
[1:37:21] didn't destroy them because he
[1:37:23] remembered they were flesh he remembered
[1:37:26] that they were humans so he's constantly
[1:37:28] reminding it and in the sabbatical year
[1:37:31] which in every seven years they would
[1:37:33] make a release that's in Deuteronomy
[1:37:34] 1515 it says and thou shalt remember
[1:37:37] that thou was abundant in the land of
[1:37:39] Egypt and the LORD thy God redeemed thee
[1:37:41] therefore I command thee this thing
[1:37:43] today
[1:37:44] feast of weeks Deuteronomy 16 and 12 and
[1:37:48] thou shalt remember that that was a
[1:37:49] bondman in Egypt Deuteronomy 24 18 but
[1:37:53] thou shalt remember that I was a bond
[1:37:55] man in Egypt and the Lord that God
[1:37:56] redeemed these ends Deuteronomy 24 22
[1:37:59] and thou shalt remember that that was a
[1:38:01] bondman in the land of Egypt and you're
[1:38:03] thinking look I thought we were supposed
[1:38:05] to forget that we were slaves
[1:38:07] why is he constantly reminding them I
[1:38:10] delivered you you were bondsman you were
[1:38:14] slaves the reason he constantly is
[1:38:17] reminding them of that is they began to
[1:38:18] look back at Egypt as if it was
[1:38:20] something Pleasant they began to look
[1:38:22] back at Egypt and say Egypt was good
[1:38:25] Egypt has this and he's constantly
[1:38:27] having a Tim don't you remember you were
[1:38:28] slaves don't you remember that you were
[1:38:30] a bondsman don't you remember you're
[1:38:32] remembering the wrong things and you're
[1:38:34] forgetting the wrong things you need to
[1:38:35] forget what needs to be forgotten and
[1:38:36] remember what needs to be remembered you
[1:38:39] were slaves you were beat you were
[1:38:41] worked every single day you had no time
[1:38:43] for God and yet you're looking back
[1:38:45] going we ain't freely
[1:38:47] you did nothing freely you gave your
[1:38:49] backs to Pharaoh Satan with a terrible
[1:38:51] torment or a terrible taskmaster do not
[1:38:53] look back and say oh it was good you
[1:38:55] were slaves he says constantly reminding
[1:38:59] them I set you free I set you free
[1:39:00] because otherwise they would forget they
[1:39:03] were always forgetting and looking back
[1:39:04] with fondness numbers eleven five we
[1:39:07] remember the fish which we did eat in
[1:39:09] Egypt freely the cucumbers and the
[1:39:12] melons and the leeks and the onions and
[1:39:14] the garlic
[1:39:14] but now our soul now that we're in this
[1:39:17] message is dried away there's nothing at
[1:39:21] all besides this manner before our eyes
[1:39:27] notice here how they remember and what
[1:39:32] they forgotten they forgotten the whips
[1:39:35] on their back they forgotten their
[1:39:37] children were being murdered their women
[1:39:39] were being ravished when we complain and
[1:39:44] look back have we forgotten how evil the
[1:39:46] world was to us have we forgotten what
[1:39:49] an evil taskmaster Satan was in our
[1:39:51] lives have we forgotten what he did to
[1:39:53] our families have you forgotten what
[1:39:55] he's done to your children when we look
[1:39:58] backwards have we forgotten what a
[1:40:00] sacrifice Jesus paid at Calvary so that
[1:40:02] we could come out of that look it's okay
[1:40:07] to remember it's not okay to look bad
[1:40:11] because a memory is I'm still walking
[1:40:14] forward doesn't show a longing in my
[1:40:15] heart but if I stop and I look back
[1:40:20] remember Lot's wife if you're wanting to
[1:40:26] look back this morning repent and
[1:40:29] remember what God has done for you
[1:40:32] repent and remember what he's done don't
[1:40:36] forget that the taskmaster upon you
[1:40:38] don't forget your slavery to drugs and
[1:40:40] alcohol and things of that nature you
[1:40:42] look back you say you know what I had a
[1:40:43] pretty good time with my friends I did
[1:40:46] it here looking at it with fondness or
[1:40:48] at least you're not looking at it with
[1:40:49] the hatred and the disgust that you
[1:40:51] should be looking at it with it should
[1:40:53] be a part of our lives that we don't
[1:40:55] want anything of except to remember my
[1:40:57] God is good
[1:40:58] the only reason I remember is because I
[1:41:00] say God you saved me the only reason I
[1:41:02] even remember it is I can say Lord Jesus
[1:41:04] thank you so much that when I was lost
[1:41:07] and undone when I was on my way to a
[1:41:09] sinner's grave in a devil's hell you
[1:41:11] cared enough about me to reach down and
[1:41:12] save me when I wasn't even looking for
[1:41:14] you and I remember it this morning and
[1:41:17] I'll praise you for it this morning
[1:41:18] no matter where I found myself at today
[1:41:20] I'm not
[1:41:21] there no matter where you find yourself
[1:41:23] at today you're not back there you're
[1:41:26] not still stuck in Egypt you may be in
[1:41:29] the middle of a battle but you're on
[1:41:30] your way to the promised land I'm
[1:41:32] willing to fight any battle on my way to
[1:41:35] the promised land remember where you are
[1:41:37] remember where you're going and forget
[1:41:40] the things in the past forget those
[1:41:46] things and press on we begin to say well
[1:41:49] maybe it wasn't really so bad yes it was
[1:41:51] bad
[1:41:53] we almost remember it was almost as a
[1:41:55] pleasantry have you forgotten the
[1:41:58] stripes of your taskmaster and maybe you
[1:42:03] don't want to go back maybe you
[1:42:04] recognize that you're free but if you
[1:42:06] brought some things of Egypt along with
[1:42:08] you God was angry that they were lusting
[1:42:14] for Egyptian food he was angry that even
[1:42:19] despite what they get he gave he gave
[1:42:21] the manna that they were lusting for the
[1:42:23] Egyptian food says his mana not enough
[1:42:26] is the revealed word and this I were not
[1:42:29] enough for you brother branham says I
[1:42:32] wonder if we're sufficiently impressed
[1:42:34] with the presence of God is it not
[1:42:37] enough as the open seven seals not
[1:42:39] enough that we have to look back and
[1:42:40] look for other things is it such a
[1:42:43] boring thing that we have to cram
[1:42:44] entertainment down our face at all times
[1:42:47] to where it consumes us are you that
[1:42:51] bored with what God has done
[1:43:00] he's opened the word in this day never
[1:43:03] forget what went in the Ministry of
[1:43:05] Malachi for never forget what he's done
[1:43:07] for you in this last day never forget
[1:43:10] the signs and the wonders and the
[1:43:11] healings and not only that they were
[1:43:13] done back there you know I think brother
[1:43:14] Brannon would be ashamed and upset if
[1:43:16] he'd thought that people believed it was
[1:43:18] only to be done in his ministry that
[1:43:20] thing where that was that gift was
[1:43:21] demonstrated before us to show us that
[1:43:23] the pillar of fire had returned to the
[1:43:25] church you never forget that the pillar
[1:43:28] of fire is still with you today
[1:43:29] never forget that he's in this building
[1:43:31] to do the same things that he's always
[1:43:33] done never forget that he's here to
[1:43:35] deliver you out of whatever situation
[1:43:36] you're in because he's done it before
[1:43:37] he'll do it again
[1:43:39] never forget these things have we
[1:43:41] forgotten that we were slaves have we
[1:43:43] forgotten that we were lost have you
[1:43:48] forgotten that you've been set free
[1:43:51] never forget it's kind of our thing the
[1:43:56] enemy wants you to forget the slavery he
[1:43:58] wants you to forget the stripes he wants
[1:44:02] you to forget the bondage you know
[1:44:04] there's those in the world today trying
[1:44:05] to claim that the Holocaust didn't even
[1:44:07] happen or trying to claim that it wasn't
[1:44:10] as bad as they say it was but the people
[1:44:13] in Israel say no no we will never forget
[1:44:15] everywhere you go there's memorials
[1:44:17] about it everywhere you go there's signs
[1:44:19] everywhere you go they're talking about
[1:44:21] it as I say we will never forget because
[1:44:23] they recognize that if you ever forget
[1:44:24] how bad it was you don't even have to
[1:44:26] forget that it happened but if you begin
[1:44:28] to think maybe it wasn't so bad if you
[1:44:30] begin to think it wasn't as bad as the
[1:44:31] others say it was then you're doomed to
[1:44:33] begin to repeat that process when we
[1:44:37] begin to forget where we came from we're
[1:44:42] doomed to repeat it we cannot forget
[1:44:45] what it was that God saved us from yes
[1:44:47] it was that bad yes the life of sin was
[1:44:51] that evil I was on my way to hell I
[1:44:54] don't care where you were you were on
[1:44:56] your way to hell I'd say that's pretty
[1:44:58] bad well I didn't live as bad as others
[1:45:01] you were on your way to
[1:45:02] hell I'd say that's pretty bad so
[1:45:05] wherever you are today at least you're
[1:45:07] not on your way to hell so you ought to
[1:45:10] be able to give him your everything give
[1:45:12] him your all every time there's an
[1:45:14] opportunity to remember and an
[1:45:15] opportunity to praise some maybe look
[1:45:18] backwards today even at the
[1:45:20] denominations and the things that they
[1:45:21] came out of and they begin to try to
[1:45:24] bring denominational ideas into this
[1:45:26] message because in their mind it wasn't
[1:45:28] that bad yes it was that bad there was
[1:45:32] no freedom in those camps the church
[1:45:34] system was that bad that's why God
[1:45:36] called you out of it
[1:45:38] it wasn't a reformation this time this
[1:45:41] time he said it is that bad get out of
[1:45:44] her my people because there's going to
[1:45:46] be plagues fall upon her that Roman
[1:45:48] system it tortured millions and killed
[1:45:51] millions of your brothers and sisters
[1:45:53] how can we forget that it was that bad
[1:45:56] it is that bad we must remember them we
[1:46:00] must remember the stand that they took
[1:46:02] in their day don't let those things just
[1:46:05] become something you talk about we must
[1:46:07] not forget the rugged soldiers of the
[1:46:09] past that have gone home the pastor's
[1:46:12] that stood the men who stood in
[1:46:15] circumstances way worse than what we
[1:46:17] stand in hiding in houses and basements
[1:46:20] and caves hiding here and there standing
[1:46:22] for the word we must remember the men of
[1:46:25] the great revivals gone past you had
[1:46:27] Luther and the great Reformation and
[1:46:29] Edwards in Whitefield and the first
[1:46:31] Great Awakening and then then you have
[1:46:33] Finney and Spurgeon and different ones
[1:46:36] like that down to men women children who
[1:46:39] still we can't forget them
[1:46:41] they're invested in what you do today
[1:46:45] they're invested men and women who were
[1:46:47] tortured to death and would not recount
[1:46:52] children burned at the stake and torture
[1:46:55] and they would not recap
[1:46:57] they would not recant they would even
[1:46:59] praise God right up to the point of
[1:47:01] their death many of them even preach in
[1:47:03] to the ones that were killed I'll tell
[1:47:05] him you can be saved they wouldn't stop
[1:47:07] but I can't praise God this Sunday
[1:47:10] because I had a bad week and they would
[1:47:17] sit there with their stomachs ripped
[1:47:18] apart hands tied back burning going I
[1:47:20] love you Jesus thank you lord thank you
[1:47:23] for this opportunity to give my life for
[1:47:24] you but I had a bad week how can one be
[1:47:31] so callous and how can we forget so
[1:47:33] easily we expect it to be a flowery bed
[1:47:37] of ease you must remember it's a war
[1:47:38] today you must remember it's a battle
[1:47:41] you must remember they're watching you
[1:47:44] even today those that gave their life or
[1:47:46] watching even today because they without
[1:47:48] you cannot be made perfect they are
[1:47:51] counting on your success they are
[1:47:53] invested in your success that watch it
[1:47:55] go and don't forget don't forget we laid
[1:47:59] our lives down today don't forget
[1:48:01] remember what he's done for you
[1:48:03] don't forget Preston battle they told
[1:48:06] brother Branham there they said press
[1:48:07] the battle press the battle you don't
[1:48:10] don't forget what's at the end of the
[1:48:11] road they're invested in what you and I
[1:48:14] do and we cannot forget this morning God
[1:48:21] have mercy on us for how easy we had it
[1:48:24] I will not forget when that same spirit
[1:48:29] that ruled those denominations and that
[1:48:30] Romans spirit that put all those people
[1:48:32] together to death begins to try to come
[1:48:34] back in the church denominational
[1:48:36] spirits try to come into the message
[1:48:37] church and once again take rule over
[1:48:39] God's people we will not forget we will
[1:48:42] not stand by and let the devils of cold
[1:48:44] dark formalism begin to come back into
[1:48:46] our services when they're trying to push
[1:48:48] out the leadership of the Spirit trying
[1:48:50] to push out the moving on the Holy
[1:48:51] Spirit I will not forget I will not
[1:48:54] forget what Malachi 4 was sent to to
[1:48:56] turn our hearts back to don't forget
[1:48:57] what you were restored to you were not
[1:48:59] restored back to the word the original
[1:49:01] word at Pentecost so you can sit on a
[1:49:03] Pew and think about tomorrow or sit on a
[1:49:05] Pew and think about what you did
[1:49:06] yesterday
[1:49:07] he didn't go through all the trouble of
[1:49:09] sending you malachi for behold
[1:49:11] i'll send on to you malachi for and you
[1:49:14] go have you forgot that he's opened the
[1:49:19] seals
[1:49:20] has he forgot that he allows you to see
[1:49:22] your name i will not sit by idly and
[1:49:25] allow us to go back to cold formal
[1:49:27] church services do not take our church
[1:49:29] services for granted do not take the
[1:49:32] moving of the spirit for granted do not
[1:49:34] forget what he's told us back to well
[1:49:36] people are wondering why are people
[1:49:38] leaving the church why are people
[1:49:39] leaving the message why our family's
[1:49:41] falling apart they forgot what we were
[1:49:43] restored to they'd forgotten and they
[1:49:46] became cold and formal and mechanical
[1:49:49] and mechanical and it holds no one don't
[1:49:54] forget what we have to have in this day
[1:49:56] to overcome he wants to rob the life
[1:50:00] take the moving on the spirit but we
[1:50:05] won't forget brother Brown says the
[1:50:08] riches about blessings may rest upon
[1:50:11] this people and may they go from here
[1:50:14] this day filled with the Holy Ghost may
[1:50:16] they live from hereafter Lord filled
[1:50:18] with your spirit may they never forget
[1:50:21] this that they're contending for the
[1:50:24] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:50:27] Saints you're contending for the faith
[1:50:30] it was once lost but it's been put back
[1:50:33] in your hands what are you going to do
[1:50:35] with it
[1:50:36] what will you do now that it's in your
[1:50:38] hands and it's your race to run we must
[1:50:41] remember and if we remember then we can
[1:50:47] praise Him not just on Wednesdays not
[1:50:51] just on Sunday but when we do come
[1:50:54] together on those Wednesdays and Sundays
[1:50:55] you can just pour it all out you can let
[1:50:58] it all go you can remember how he healed
[1:51:00] me you can remember how he saved me you
[1:51:02] can remember how he delivered me and
[1:51:04] then if you can remember there's nothing
[1:51:07] that will keep you from singing and
[1:51:08] there's nothing that will keep you from
[1:51:09] shout and there's nothing that will keep
[1:51:11] you from pulling on the word because you
[1:51:13] remember what he's done
[1:51:17] remembering brings worshiped remembering
[1:51:20] always brings worship but when we forget
[1:51:23] we often see it reflect in our praise
[1:51:25] not only in service but the praise that
[1:51:28] our life gives off each and every day we
[1:51:33] see it affect the dedication we have to
[1:51:35] the house of God those that remember are
[1:51:38] dedicated to the house of God those who
[1:51:41] have forgotten hey we'll see maybe maybe
[1:51:46] not
[1:51:46] you've forgotten what he did for you you
[1:51:49] don't remember those who have forgotten
[1:51:51] see it affect their dedication to prayer
[1:51:54] but our praise reflects our remembrance
[1:51:58] brother Branham would say it's been my
[1:52:01] great mystery in my life of all things
[1:52:04] that he wondered about he said this is
[1:52:06] my great mystery how can the Scriptures
[1:52:10] be so plain and the people set there and
[1:52:13] know that the Spirit of Christ is in the
[1:52:15] room now he's talking about where he
[1:52:17] says where two or three guy that I'll be
[1:52:18] there in the midst of you this is the
[1:52:20] great mystery - brother Branham how can
[1:52:22] you know the scripture so plain and know
[1:52:25] that the Spirit of Christ is in the room
[1:52:26] and can hold your peace I can't
[1:52:31] understand it unless their eyes are not
[1:52:35] open think about it it becomes common to
[1:52:39] us but Jesus Christ is in this room and
[1:52:46] because you don't see his flesh you
[1:52:49] think you can take the service off or go
[1:52:52] halfway in your heart ask yourself this
[1:52:55] if he was standing here in the flesh if
[1:52:58] he appeared here in the flesh
[1:53:00] would you have acted the exact same way
[1:53:02] in the service that you've acted today
[1:53:04] and I'm not getting on to y'all been
[1:53:07] wonderful I'm just asking you a question
[1:53:10] would it have been exactly the same
[1:53:13] would you as saying exactly the same
[1:53:16] with him standing here pouring the
[1:53:18] worship on him I think not
[1:53:24] I think not for myself at least I'll
[1:53:26] speak for myself
[1:53:27] I think not for me how can you believe
[1:53:31] that the Spirit of Christ is in the room
[1:53:32] and hold your peace when I realized that
[1:53:38] he took my place through a divine
[1:53:41] exchange I can't hold my peace when I
[1:53:45] realized that I was gonna die and go to
[1:53:47] hell I can't hold my peace when I
[1:53:49] realized he's healed in my body I can't
[1:53:51] hold my peace when I realized that he
[1:53:53] pulled us out of denominations I can't
[1:53:54] hold my peace when I realized he's never
[1:53:56] failed I can't hold my peace when I
[1:53:58] realized that he's coming very very soon
[1:54:00] brother Branham said I can hear the
[1:54:02] ticking of the clock and I can I can see
[1:54:05] the angel getting ready to proclaim no
[1:54:07] more it's right here I can't hold my
[1:54:09] peace it excites me to know that it's
[1:54:12] almost over it excites me to know that
[1:54:14] I'm fitting to go home it excites me to
[1:54:16] know that he's in our building in this
[1:54:17] place every time we worship it excites
[1:54:19] me to know that he goes home with me he
[1:54:21] rides in the car with me it excites me
[1:54:23] to know that he's never left me and
[1:54:24] never forsaken me that's enough this
[1:54:26] morning I can say I am not forsaken
[1:54:29] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus I'm not
[1:54:31] forsaken
[1:54:35] [Applause]
[1:54:43] it's enough to shout about thank you
[1:54:46] Lord Jesus how can I not praise your
[1:54:49] brother Brown says and when the church
[1:54:50] gets to the place where that Christ
[1:54:51] means so much to us that we thirst to
[1:54:54] get in his presence we thirst you know
[1:54:56] what it is to be thirsty you gotta have
[1:54:58] so you gotta have it your mouth parched
[1:55:00] you got to have it that's how it should
[1:55:02] be on Sunday and Wednesday I gotta get
[1:55:04] there I got to get there I got to get
[1:55:06] there and worship
[1:55:07] he says when you're that thirsty to get
[1:55:10] in his presence and get with each other
[1:55:15] Wow the gathering together is important
[1:55:19] why have church just at home by myself
[1:55:21] that's not very important that I gather
[1:55:23] with people what the Prophet said it was
[1:55:24] the scripture said it was that's good
[1:55:28] enough for me gather with each other
[1:55:31] it's a life-giving resource no devil can
[1:55:34] ever overtake you and in doing so we
[1:55:37] remember Christ was the one who made it
[1:55:39] possible for us he was the one who did
[1:55:41] these things for us we must remember him
[1:55:44] for remember once you was aliens and
[1:55:47] without God Gentiles carried away with
[1:55:49] dumb idols but remember Christ died not
[1:55:52] for the Jew but for every creature of
[1:55:54] Adam's fallen race Christ died can we
[1:55:57] remember that this morning Jesus died
[1:55:59] for me what else do I need he died for
[1:56:01] me he saved me he redeemed me his blood
[1:56:04] is sufficient this morning I remember
[1:56:07] Lord Jesus the things you took I want me
[1:56:09] remember that beating you took the
[1:56:11] stripes you took that were supposed to
[1:56:12] be for my back the cat of nine tails
[1:56:15] would just rip the flesh out Lord I
[1:56:17] remember they took the thorns and they
[1:56:19] smashed it deep down in his head Lord I
[1:56:21] remember I haven't forgotten it was for
[1:56:23] me Lord I'm gonna praise you this
[1:56:25] morning because of it there may be a
[1:56:27] thousand other things you can praise him
[1:56:29] for but I know you can at least find one
[1:56:31] and
[1:56:32] you can look to Calgary this morning and
[1:56:34] say it was for me but I praise you today
[1:56:36] because it was roomy I remember Lord
[1:56:39] Jesus let us never forget
[1:56:43] but Satan's designed this world to make
[1:56:46] you forget
[1:56:49] he knows that man has a problem
[1:56:51] remembering even the disciples did this
[1:56:54] with Jesus his story
[1:56:56] it's amazing to me in Matthew 16 5 it
[1:56:59] says and when his disciples were come to
[1:57:00] the other side they had forgotten to
[1:57:02] take bread then said Jesus under them
[1:57:05] now he's teaching them something here a
[1:57:07] doctrinal thing and he says take heed
[1:57:10] and beware of the leaven of the
[1:57:13] Pharisees and Sadducees now because
[1:57:17] their carnal mind did and they're hungry
[1:57:18] and they've forgotten to bring bread
[1:57:20] they say and they reasoned among
[1:57:23] themselves saying is it because we
[1:57:26] forgot to bring bread is that what's
[1:57:29] going on here we didn't bring bread so
[1:57:30] he's talking about leaven of the
[1:57:32] Pharisees and Sadducees which when Jesus
[1:57:34] perceived he said unto them o ye of
[1:57:37] little faith
[1:57:37] why reason ye among yourselves because
[1:57:40] you brought no bread do you not
[1:57:43] understand
[1:57:44] neither remember the five loaves of the
[1:57:47] five thousand and how many baskets you
[1:57:49] took up neither the seven loaves of the
[1:57:52] four thousand and how many baskets you
[1:57:54] took up the story continues and another
[1:57:57] it's also told in mark 8 18 he says
[1:58:01] having eyes see you not in having ears
[1:58:04] hear you not and do you not remember and
[1:58:08] when I break the five loaves among the
[1:58:10] five thousand how many baskets full of
[1:58:12] fragments took you up I can see them
[1:58:15] kind of being sheepish now because
[1:58:16] they're probably not feeling real bright
[1:58:17] at the moment and they said twelve
[1:58:23] and he says and when the seven among
[1:58:26] four thousand how many baskets full of
[1:58:28] fragments took you up they said seven
[1:58:32] now I'm sure and I don't mean the
[1:58:35] sacrilegious but I'm sure Jesus didn't
[1:58:37] talk the way we talk but I also look at
[1:58:41] it and realized the disciples were his
[1:58:42] friends and and I have to imagine he was
[1:58:44] human and he talked to him like friends

[1:58:49] worried about bread really with all this
[1:58:53] going on you're worried about bread I

[2:02:10] little cysts want hurt you you know that
[2:02:13] don't you you know that it won't hurt
[2:02:14] you and your worries that you got on
[2:02:17] your heart it won't hurt you but you
[2:02:18] must remember that God is your healer
[2:02:21] look we've seen the miracles we've heard
[2:02:25] the word for years but have we forgotten
[2:02:28] you say brother brother I hadn't
[2:02:31] forgotten I remember all those things if
[2:02:32] you ask the children of Israel they
[2:02:34] would have told you they hadn't
[2:02:35] forgotten as well because they could
[2:02:37] still recite it they could tell you all
[2:02:40] about it
[2:02:41] but their life and their actions proved
[2:02:44] otherwise their words said in one point
[2:02:47] they said they remember that he was
[2:02:49] their rock and in some sending out and
[2:02:51] cried out to him he said but they were
[2:02:53] just giving him lip service they were a
[2:02:55] line they really didn't remember you say
[2:02:58] but there and I haven't forgot I can
[2:02:59] remember I can tell you about sister
[2:03:01] Elena I can tell you about the day he
[2:03:02] saved me I can tell you and then the
[2:03:05] worship goes forth this song again you
[2:03:12] forgotten the children of Israel would
[2:03:16] tell you they hadn't forgotten but God
[2:03:18] looked at him and said they'd forgotten
[2:03:19] me and it enraged him and it made him
[2:03:24] angry and they would say we loved Lord
[2:03:26] he'd say they'd forgotten me even in
[2:03:29] light Tabernacle we must remember this
[2:03:32] morning first Chronicles 16 and 12 I'm
[2:03:37] trying to hurry remember his marvelous
[2:03:39] works that he had done his wonders in
[2:03:43] the judgments of his mouth
[2:03:45] the marvelous works of God cannot become
[2:03:48] common to us as I mentioned earlier we
[2:03:50] cannot take his presence for granted
[2:03:52] there is nothing that can replace the
[2:03:54] presence of Almighty God there is
[2:03:56] nothing like it when he moved down in a
[2:03:58] service I've said it many times I've
[2:03:59] said it to friends I said there's
[2:04:01] nothing like that in the world I've
[2:04:03] experienced a lot of things in the world
[2:04:05] things I wish I had not experienced and
[2:04:06] yet I can tell you this there is nothing
[2:04:09] like the presence of God there is
[2:04:11] nothing that can compare to the presence
[2:04:13] of mamani God and his works are so
[2:04:16] wonderful and he's gone to such great
[2:04:17] lengths to make sure that we didn't miss
[2:04:19] it
[2:04:19] he sent Malachi four hundred thousands
[2:04:22] upon thousands times thousands of
[2:04:23] miracles opened the seal signs and
[2:04:26] wonders to make sure you wouldn't miss
[2:04:28] it
[2:04:28] he over vindicated it to the point that
[2:04:30] you cannot miss it unless you just
[2:04:32] choose to walk away from it to ensure
[2:04:35] that it was so overly vindicated that
[2:04:37] you would have absolutely no doubt and
[2:04:39] as a people that are accustomed to the
[2:04:41] supernatural that have heard about the
[2:04:42] supernatural your whole life that is
[2:04:44] witnessed the supernatural God hates it
[2:04:46] when it becomes common God hates it when
[2:04:49] we don't look at it and realize how
[2:04:50] precious it is how wonderful it is how
[2:04:52] mighty
[2:04:53] his brother branham says you've seen the
[2:04:55] Lord God manifests himself and do the
[2:04:57] things that he said he would do until
[2:04:58] it's become so common there's no more
[2:05:00] thrill to it
[2:05:01] God shake us tonight God is so good to
[2:05:04] you people and you people who are full
[2:05:05] gospel and believe all the Bible God has
[2:05:07] done so many miracles and done so many
[2:05:09] things for you he's been so good and you
[2:05:12] don't recognize it
[2:05:13] wake up open your eyes he's standing
[2:05:16] he's knocking trying to get in to
[2:05:18] control you to make you what you should
[2:05:20] be to take away the world from you and
[2:05:22] to make you new creatures of his that's
[2:05:24] why he gives you these things that he
[2:05:26] has given you and then he goes and he
[2:05:29] tells the story about the young man
[2:05:32] walking down to the seashore and he was
[2:05:34] so excited to go down to the seashore he
[2:05:37] wanted to see the waves leaping and the
[2:05:39] Whitecaps and the seagulls and smelled
[2:05:41] the sea salt he was excited to go you
[2:05:44] remember when you were excited to come
[2:05:45] to the house of God like that I can't
[2:05:46] wait to see what God's gonna do today I
[2:05:48] can't wait to see him move I love it
[2:05:50] when I'm hanging out with people or just
[2:05:52] sitting around on Saturday and you hear
[2:05:53] somebody say man I can't wait for church
[2:05:55] tomorrow I love that I can't wait to get
[2:05:58] into service tomorrow I'm looking
[2:05:59] forward to the service tomorrow and he's
[2:06:01] walking down to the sea and he meets an
[2:06:03] old sailor he says where are you going
[2:06:04] I'm going down to the sea it's gonna be
[2:06:07] wonderful I can't wait to see these
[2:06:08] things I can't wait to smell this and
[2:06:10] and and the sailor says I was borned on
[2:06:14] the sea I've been there for 40 years
[2:06:17] there isn't nothing thrilling about it
[2:06:18] that I can see he'd seen it so much till
[2:06:21] it become common to me when it gets to
[2:06:25] the point that you aren't excited to see
[2:06:27] what's gonna happen in church on Sunday
[2:06:28] and you aren't excited to see what's
[2:06:30] gonna happen in church on Wednesday it's
[2:06:31] become common to you it's gotten to the
[2:06:34] point where it doesn't throw your heart
[2:06:36] anymore brother Brown says your fathers
[2:06:37] and mothers rejoice when God had been to
[2:06:39] pour out his Spirit upon the church and
[2:06:41] sometimes today I think we can say your
[2:06:44] young people and your sons and daughters
[2:06:45] are rejoicing when they get to come to
[2:06:47] church how about you older folks how
[2:06:49] about you get with it sometimes we have
[2:06:50] a wonderful group of people I'm not
[2:06:52] piling on anybody I'm just saying let's
[2:06:54] all get in it together let's all move
[2:06:56] together let's all push together we have
[2:06:59] one common goal we have one thing and
[2:07:01] calling and our purpose is to leave here
[2:07:03] in a rapture don't forget what you're
[2:07:05] here for and when you come to the house
[2:07:07] of God recognize there may be people
[2:07:08] that aren't as far long as you and they
[2:07:10] need a touch and you may be just fine
[2:07:12] but you say I'm going to create an
[2:07:13] atmosphere so that person can be blessed
[2:07:15] so that person can be saved so that
[2:07:17] person can be healed Lord I'm going to
[2:07:19] give you my all this morning don't
[2:07:21] forget why we're here he goes on in that
[2:07:24] story and he says and now he says what
[2:07:27] about you Assemblies of God why you
[2:07:29] stood on the corner a little tambourine
[2:07:31] and everything else you would have died
[2:07:33] for the cause and now you won't walk
[2:07:34] across the street for the cause what
[2:07:36] happened you did run well what hindered
[2:07:39] you it's because it's common to you you
[2:07:41] believe it all sure you do but it
[2:07:46] doesn't thrill you anymore it's so
[2:07:48] common God's so good to you and you
[2:07:51] don't realize it he says you've seen him
[2:07:55] open the eyes of the blind and some of
[2:07:56] y'all wouldn't walk across the street to
[2:07:58] see it again you've seen him heal the
[2:08:02] sick you've seen him perform miracles
[2:08:04] you've done all this and it's so common
[2:08:06] it doesn't thrill you anymore Church
[2:08:08] please don't let our services become
[2:08:10] common don't get to the point when the
[2:08:12] spirit moves you sit there and go oh
[2:08:15] yeah she gets exciting all the time
[2:08:18] somebody breaks forth in a blessing
[2:08:20] again
[2:08:21] oh yeah that's about third time this
[2:08:24] month well you know if you were the one
[2:08:26] getting touched and getting excited to
[2:08:28] enter in you wouldn't know about it
[2:08:29] because it would be you getting blessed
[2:08:31] it would be you getting touched it would
[2:08:33] be you giving your all at the very least
[2:08:35] you know what I understand full well
[2:08:38] you've heard brother Joe say this before
[2:08:39] we're not all going to act the same I
[2:08:41] totally understand that but there ain't
[2:08:43] a one of us who should be able to sit
[2:08:44] there with our mouths closed and our
[2:08:46] hands down and a stone face and a church
[2:08:48] service I don't care what your
[2:08:49] personality is I don't care what your
[2:08:51] makeup is God's done enough for you that
[2:08:53] you can at least say hallelujah thank
[2:08:55] you Jesus
[2:08:55] God's done enough for you that you can
[2:08:57] at least sing the songs
[2:08:58] I've done enough for you that you can't
[2:08:59] least clap your hands you don't got to
[2:09:02] run around this church but when I do I
[2:09:04] don't need you to be critical I need you
[2:09:06] to say praise God he's getting the blood
[2:09:08] soon this morning I'm thankful he's
[2:09:09] getting a blessing this morning and when
[2:09:11] you tuck off and when you dance and when
[2:09:13] you shut I'm gonna say praise God
[2:09:15] they're getting the blessing praise God
[2:09:20] they got a blessing but we can all do
[2:09:23] something because he's done so much for
[2:09:28] us
[2:09:29] don't let these services become common
[2:09:32] it should excite us every single time
[2:09:34] when God moves he wants us to remember
[2:09:37] him in our services he wants us to
[2:09:39] remember him in our life and he wants us
[2:09:41] to give Him praise he wants our praise
[2:09:43] he wants our praise he wants our worship
[2:09:48] you say but I'm not made that way he
[2:09:50] wants your praise I don't feel like it
[2:09:53] today he wants your praise but I had a
[2:09:56] bad week I said he wants your praise you
[2:10:00] cannot forget listen he's looking for
[2:10:02] somebody in this day and I believe
[2:10:04] there's a people in the face of the
[2:10:06] earth who will remember he's looking for
[2:10:08] somebody to remember somebody who
[2:10:10] recognizes that it's a miracle that I'm
[2:10:12] even sitting in this building this
[2:10:13] morning somebody who recognized that
[2:10:15] should have been dead a long time ago
[2:10:16] but here I am somebody who is lost but
[2:10:19] now they're found somebody who is on
[2:10:21] their way to hell but now they're on
[2:10:22] their way to a rapture and they praise
[2:10:24] Him they praise Him when they had a bad
[2:10:26] day they praise Him when they had a good
[2:10:28] day they praise Him when things go bad
[2:10:30] they praise Him when things go wrong
[2:10:31] they praise him no matter what he's
[2:10:33] looking for somebody that has not
[2:10:35] forgotten somebody that'll worship
[2:10:39] brother brands his oh brother I wonder
[2:10:41] if the warriors today are willing to cut
[2:10:43] their way through formalism doubts and
[2:10:45] unbelief to refresh the presence of the
[2:10:47] Lord he was telling the story of David
[2:10:49] and the soldiers I went to get him a
[2:10:50] drink he says is there somebody here
[2:10:52] that will give the Lord a drink a fresh
[2:10:55] drink of their praise a good fresh
[2:10:57] offering of praise and worship
[2:10:59] he says the least of his desires if it's
[2:11:02] Africa India if it's
[2:11:04] the street the least of your desires
[2:11:06] Lord is my command death don't mean a
[2:11:08] thing to me popularity don't mean
[2:11:10] nothing me what I am what I will be
[2:11:12] means nothing Lord is to fulfill your
[2:11:15] desires
[2:11:15] that's the Warriors that standing by the
[2:11:17] side of him if they call me a Holy
[2:11:19] Roller if my name is scandalize if they
[2:11:21] kick me in the street that doesn't
[2:11:23] matter your desire is my command that's
[2:11:26] a real soldier I say it's time for
[2:11:29] evening light Tabernacle to remember
[2:11:30] this morning I say it's time to forget
[2:11:32] what you should forget and remember what
[2:11:34] needs to be remembered brother branham
[2:11:36] goes on to say if you've seen God
[2:11:39] provide and do a miracle then can't he
[2:11:41] do a miracle again see in other words
[2:11:44] like this if he saved you from sin can
[2:11:46] he not heal your body don't you remember
[2:11:48] when you as a sinner how he lifted up
[2:11:50] your soul and faith to believe can't he
[2:11:53] likewise do something great for you
[2:11:54] again can't he can't he do a miracle or
[2:11:57] something else for you the five baskets
[2:11:59] remember when they crossed over the Red
[2:12:02] Sea God opened the way like that made
[2:12:04] the Red Sea open and walked through he
[2:12:06] come right on the other side and as soon
[2:12:07] as they didn't have water they started
[2:12:09] murmuring as soon as they got without
[2:12:11] bread they started crying we don't have
[2:12:13] no bread didn't you consider the miracle
[2:12:15] back there at the Red Sea have you not
[2:12:18] come down when they got all in a spot by
[2:12:20] the Red Sea they said oh we ought to
[2:12:22] have died here comes the Egyptians on us
[2:12:24] now here it is what are we going to do
[2:12:26] he said who smote the earth with plagues
[2:12:29] down there who kept the sun shining in
[2:12:31] Goshen see we must remember those things
[2:12:33] remember God is God any of it he's still
[2:12:37] God he certainly can do anything
[2:12:40] remember this morning remember this
[2:12:43] morning God is God for your situation

[2:13:31] sons of God

[2:13:39] leave you or forsake you he told me a
[2:13:44] devil told me that I was no good now I
[2:13:47] was unworthy but I remember this morning
[2:13:49] Lord that you said you chose me to be a
[2:13:52] people for his treasured possession but
[2:13:55] I remembered that you loved me when I
[2:13:57] was unlovable

[2:14:57] dry land thousands of men forgot who
[2:15:00] they were but David remembered and it
[2:15:03] brought victory against Goliath

[2:15:13] remembrance listen even if you were in
[2:15:16] the enemy's prison this morning and I'm
[2:15:18] bringing this to a close even if you
[2:15:23] forgot him I promise he has not
[2:15:25] forgotten you maybe you used to be
[2:15:28] victorious maybe you used to remember
[2:15:32] brother branham said that Samson
[2:15:34] actually won battles because he
[2:15:35] remembered he was seed of Abraham he
[2:15:37] would get in a bad situation there'll be
[2:15:39] nothing around he'd say I'm seed of
[2:15:41] Abraham and he just reached down and
[2:15:44] pick up that jaw bone and faith he says
[2:15:47] but then he forgot that he was seed of
[2:15:49] Abraham by birth brother Branham says he
[2:15:54] says he forgot he was seed of Abraham by
[2:15:56] birth and then brother brown just says
[2:15:57] I'd remember I'd remember
[2:16:02] he's telling you it's important if I
[2:16:05] were you I'd remember this morning maybe
[2:16:09] you've lost your joy I'm just bringing
[2:16:12] this down to you maybe you've lost your
[2:16:14] peace maybe you've lost your praise
[2:16:16] maybe you've lost your victory and when
[2:16:19] I'm asked me to do this morning us begin
[2:16:21] to remember remember who saved you
[2:16:24] remember who healed you remembered who
[2:16:27] delivered you remember he is mighty in
[2:16:30] battle
[2:16:30] remember your enemy is a defeated foe
[2:16:33] remember that my God has conquered death
[2:16:36] hell and the grave
[2:16:36] I remember Lord though what I remember
[2:16:41] your faith to begin to build if you
[2:16:43] dwell on those things and remember
[2:16:45] brother Brandon says skipping them all
[2:16:50] this to get to the end he says let us
[2:16:54] remember you made the promise you were
[2:16:57] the ones that's responsible for this
[2:16:59] promise let us remember no matter what
[2:17:01] anyone else says you were the one you
[2:17:05] were the one that we're looking to
[2:17:06] fulfill your promise you're the one that
[2:17:10] said if he believeth in me though he
[2:17:11] were dead yet shall he live whosoever
[2:17:14] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[2:17:15] die
[2:17:17] member you said that Lord and when you
[2:17:19] said those who did believe in you
[2:17:21] now you said if we believed we had
[2:17:23] eternal life and you said those that did
[2:17:25] believe in you the works that you did
[2:17:27] they would do also now father we know
[2:17:29] that you are God and we know that there
[2:17:31] is none other but you and we believe you
[2:17:34] and we are trusting you now in the name
[2:17:36] of Jesus Christ
[2:17:37] now with our heads bowed how many in
[2:17:40] this building that knows that you're not
[2:17:42] remembering your Lord in the way that
[2:17:44] you should remember him and at the end
[2:17:47] of this little chopped-up message you're
[2:17:49] willing to raise your hand up and say
[2:17:50] god make yourself real to me till I
[2:17:53] remember you till I remember your
[2:17:56] Commandments till they be upon my
[2:17:58] bedpost
[2:17:59] I put the Lord always before me as David
[2:18:03] said Lord give me more of you that I can
[2:18:07] remember you bow your heads together
[2:18:11] with me please Psalms 20 and verse 5
[2:18:20] says we will rejoice in thy salvation
[2:18:22] and in the name of our God we will set
[2:18:25] up our banners the Lord fulfill all the
[2:18:28] petitions now know I that the Lord
[2:18:31] saveth his anointed he will hear him
[2:18:34] from his holy heaven and the saving
[2:18:36] strength of his right hand some trust in
[2:18:39] chariots some in horses but we will
[2:18:43] remember the name of the Lord our God
[2:18:47] they are brought down and fallen but we
[2:18:50] are risen and stand upright I wonder how
[2:18:58] many of us have forgotten I want to ask
[2:19:03] you now with every head bowed and every
[2:19:05] eye closed I'm not asking you to come to
[2:19:08] the altar and ask for forgiveness I'm
[2:19:10] just asking how many would raise a hand
[2:19:12] like brother Browne said say lord help
[2:19:14] me to remember
[2:19:15] helped me to remember everything you've
[2:19:18] done for me Lord help me to remember
[2:19:21] your goodness help me to remember to
[2:19:24] praise you regardless of my circumstance
[2:19:27] you know no wonder remembering is such a
[2:19:30] central theme throughout the scripture
[2:19:33] God knows our mind is drawn to
[2:19:35] forgetfulness and he wants us to
[2:19:38] remember what he has done and when we
[2:19:42] remember then we can praise Him when we
[2:19:45] remember we can have victory churches
[2:19:49] should never be a service that we don't
[2:19:51] praise Him with everything we got the
[2:19:54] day you had doesn't matter the week you
[2:19:56] had doesn't matter because if you
[2:19:58] remember the reality of what God has
[2:20:01] done for you it's so far outweighs
[2:20:04] anything you're going through
[2:20:08] think of the exchange that he made for
[2:20:10] you think of the trade he made for you
[2:20:15] have we forgotten
[2:20:19] right now I want each and every one of
[2:20:20] us to think back every one of us can go
[2:20:23] to this place think back and remember a
[2:20:26] time that God moved for you can we all
[2:20:31] go there right now to a place where God
[2:20:34] moved for you to when God touched your
[2:20:37] life and I guarantee you there's not one
[2:20:41] person sitting here that doesn't have
[2:20:43] something to thank him for there's no
[2:20:47] one here who hasn't been touched in some
[2:20:50] way by the hand of God he's worthy to be
[2:20:55] praised Lord Jesus we love you Lord
[2:21:02] you've done so very much for us Lord
[2:21:04] Jesus how could we forget you how can we
[2:21:07] forget the sacrifice Lord God at Calvary
[2:21:09] how can we forget Lord God all that

[2:21:15] been I will remember Lord I'll never
