[23:57] How many would like to just approach the
[23:59] throne of grace?
[24:03] Maybe you don't want to pray for your
[24:05] own personal need necessarily this
[24:07] morning, but you want to maybe lift
[24:10] somebody else up in prayer.
[24:12] Say, "Lord,
[24:15] there were friends of a man one day that
[24:17] took the urgency of somebody else's
[24:19] needs so desperate that they literally
[24:22] ripped the shingles off the roof.
[24:26] You might not have the chance to
[24:28] physically rip the shingles off the
[24:30] roof, but you can press somebody into
[24:32] the master's presence with your prayers
[24:34] today. Why don't we go and speak to him
[24:37] now? Heavenly Father, it's with a great
[24:40] confidence, Lord, that we come to you
[24:43] this morning. Your word is declared that
[24:46] where two or three would gather, there
[24:48] you would be in their midst. whatever
[24:51] they would ask, whatever they would
[24:53] agree upon, two or three touching any
[24:56] one thing.
[24:58] You the God of heaven that has created
[25:00] all things
[25:03] that sees every sparrow that flies, that
[25:06] falls, every gnat that bats its eye.
[25:11] Lord, we're your people. We're your
[25:13] chosen. We're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[25:17] We're the final voice to the final age.
[25:20] Lord, our petitions are being pressed
[25:22] into your presence this morning. Lord,
[25:25] there's loved ones on our hearts that
[25:27] Lord, in this late hour, this late age,
[25:30] Lord, the cries of the wars across the
[25:34] world and tremors in many places and
[25:37] certainly the end of time has come upon
[25:40] a people. And Lord, there's people that
[25:43] need to know you and the power of your
[25:44] resurrection. Lord, there's those that
[25:47] need the token on display in their
[25:49] lives. But Lord, who better to come
[25:51] before the King than Esther herself.
[25:54] So Lord, as your bride, we come before
[25:56] the King this morning, bearing our
[25:59] petitions and our needs and asking,
[26:01] Lord, that you would move one more time,
[26:04] Lord, that you would look upon your
[26:06] people this morning, not with judgment,
[26:09] not as the lion, but Lord, as the lamb.
[26:11] Look through the blood this morning. And
[26:14] Lord, may you extend the golden scepter.
[26:16] Would you offer peace,
[26:19] Lord? Not what we deserve, but Lord,
[26:22] extend grace this morning. Lord, those
[26:25] that are asking for forgiveness in their
[26:27] heart, maybe just now they're saying,
[26:29] "Lord, I plead the blood.
[26:32] Lord, I plead the blood over me and I
[26:34] plead the blood of Jesus over my family.
[26:38] Lord, extend the borders of your garment
[26:41] today,
[26:42] Lord. May this service be a real
[26:44] encouragement even as Wednesday night
[26:46] was such an encouragement to your people
[26:49] or brother Aaron ministering.
[26:51] God, I just pray that the wind of the
[26:53] Holy Spirit would just blow through this
[26:55] place. Give your people such a comfort
[26:58] in this treacherous time that we find
[27:01] ourselves living in. But Lord, we're
[27:03] looking to the cross this morning.
[27:06] Lord, we're looking to the hills from
[27:08] whence comest our help. Our help cometh
[27:12] from the Lord.

[27:16] remember the needs that have been read
[27:17] across the desk. Lord, the Joe Adams
[27:20] dad, the Simonelli family.
[27:24] Lord, you are our supplier.
[27:27] You are our healer.
[27:30] We have total confidence in you, Lord.
[27:34] You've done so many things so many times
[27:36] for so many people.
[27:39] We're saying, Lord, just once more
[27:44] committing this service to you and the
[27:46] specials that'll be sung. Lord, we just
[27:49] want to create an atmosphere where you
[27:51] would
[27:53] just desire
[27:55] to come down and walk among your people.
[27:59] We love you with a undying love this
[28:03] morning

[32:28] wretched, poor and blind.

[33:49] mystery.

[36:45] I'm removing
[36:48] all of the things that could move me
[36:52] further from you. I think you could not
[36:56] be enough.

[37:03] from. I'm running

[37:47] meets the hands of the maker.
[37:52] Nothing I wouldn't offer.

[38:21] [Music]
[38:25] I'm returning
[38:28] back to the one I am running

[38:49] May the tears of the desperate
[38:53] reach the feet of the Savior.

[39:38] and anxiety cannot live here. There's no
[39:44] waste at the altar. Let your heart sing
[39:48] out. Tell him you love him. Don't make
[39:52] it perfect. Let it be honest. He can use

[45:36] we serve. Amen. How many love him this
[45:38] morning with all your heart? Just want
[45:41] to praise him for all that he's done in
[45:44] your life and your situation. Let's just
[45:47] go to him in prayer today and just ask
[45:50] the Lord to come and speak to us.
[45:52] Father, we just want to say how much we
[45:54] love you and appreciate you. And thank
[45:57] you for this opportunity again, Lord, to
[45:59] worship you in spirit and truth. Lord,
[46:02] we just so thank you for all that you've
[46:04] done in our lives. Lord, we're so
[46:07] thankful that we can say with
[46:08] assurityity that you will be God
[46:10] forever.
[46:12] Lord, we just thank you, Lord, that we
[46:14] can serve a living God today. A God who
[46:17] hears and understands. A God who knows
[46:20] the situations that we deal with and
[46:23] circumstances that we may even find
[46:25] ourselves in today. Lord, there's
[46:27] nothing too hard for you, Lord. And
[46:29] we're know that you're not just able,
[46:31] you're more than able today to meet each
[46:33] need according thy riches and glory. We
[46:36] ask, Father, you'll just bless us in
[46:38] your presence, Lord. Bless us by your
[46:40] grace and mercy, Lord, as only you can
[46:43] do, Lord. We ask these things in Jesus
[46:46] name.
[46:47] Amen.
[46:49] Amen. Turn to Genesis chapter 18 if you
[46:52] would. Also, John chapter 14.
[46:56] Amen. I
[46:58] like to wish a happy anniversary, 29th
[47:02] anniversary to my wife, Sister Ruth. And
[47:05] been 29 years. It's hard to believe.
[47:07] That just means I'm getting really old.
[47:10] Amen. But um we uh really thankful for a
[47:13] wife that loves the Lord and loves God's
[47:16] people and and uh stands for truth and
[47:19] for righteousness. Amen. We really
[47:21] really thank the Lord for those things.
[47:23] And Amen. We just want to say we love
[47:26] you with our all of our heart today.
[47:28] We're happy to be here this morning. Uh
[47:30] it's kind maybe a different uh change up
[47:33] today than what you would think or we
[47:35] tried to get a visiting minister, but I
[47:37] guess that's who I am today because I'm
[47:38] flying out for Florida today. So, I'll
[47:40] be your visiting minister.
[47:44] Amen. We're going to go and spend a
[47:46] little time with the grandbaby who had
[47:48] it planned for anniversary and then we
[47:50] had a wedding that just messed up
[47:52] everything.
[47:55] Amen. You know, we we're thankful,
[47:57] Sister Kimberly and Brother Christopher
[47:58] and their their lives that were united
[48:01] in Christ. And we just ask God's
[48:03] blessing upon them. And Amen. God to
[48:06] just lead them and guide them today and
[48:08] the rest of their time up here on earth
[48:10] and into eternity. Amen. That's what
[48:12] we're striving for. Amen. Is eternity.
[48:15] Amen. I believe that's what our heart's
[48:16] cry ought to be upon. Genesis 18 and
[48:19] verse one said, "The Lord appeared unto
[48:21] him in the plains of Mamry. And he sat
[48:24] in the tent door in the heat of the day.
[48:26] And he lifted up his eyes and looked,
[48:28] and lo, three men stood by him. And when
[48:30] he saw them, he ran to meet them from
[48:33] the tent door, and bowed himself toward
[48:35] the ground,
[48:37] and said, My Lord, if now I have found
[48:40] favor in thy sight, pass not away, I
[48:42] pray thee, from thy servant. Let a
[48:45] little water, I pray, that you be
[48:46] fetched, and wash your feet, and rest
[48:48] yourself under the tree. And I will
[48:51] fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye
[48:53] your hearts, after that ye shall pass
[48:56] on. For therefore are ye come to your
[48:58] servant. And he said, And they said, So
[49:01] do as thou have said. And Abraham
[49:03] hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and
[49:05] said, Make ready quickly three measures
[49:07] of fine meal, knead it, make cakes upon
[49:10] the hearth. And Abraham ran into the
[49:11] herd, fetched a calf tender and good,
[49:14] and gave it to a young man, and he
[49:15] hastened, and dressed it. And he took
[49:18] butter and milk, and the calf which he
[49:20] had dressed, and set it before them, and
[49:22] he stood by them under the tree, and
[49:24] they did eat. They said unto him, Where
[49:27] is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold,
[49:29] in the tent. And he said, I will
[49:31] certainly return unto thee according to
[49:33] the time of life, and lo Sarah thy wife
[49:36] shall have a son. And Sarah heard it,
[49:39] and the tent door which was behind him.
[49:41] Now Abraham and Sarah were old and
[49:43] wellstricken in age, and it ceased to be
[49:45] with Sarah after the manner of women.
[49:48] Therefore sa Sarah jumped up and down
[49:50] and praised God and thanked him for all
[49:52] he's about to do. Now she laughed within
[49:55] her heart, saying, "After I'm waxed old,
[49:58] shall have pleasure of my Lord being old
[50:00] also." And the Lord said unto Abraham,
[50:02] "Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying shall
[50:04] I of assurity bear a child which I'm
[50:07] old? Is anything too hard for the Lord?"
[50:12] At the time appointed, I will return
[50:14] unto thee according to the time of life,
[50:16] and Sarah shall have a son. And Sarah
[50:20] denied, saying, I laugh not, for she was
[50:22] afraid. And he said, Nay, but thou
[50:24] didest laugh. John 14:12 says, "Verily,
[50:27] verily, I say unto you, he that
[50:30] believeth on me, the works that I do
[50:31] shall he do also, and greater works than
[50:34] these shall he do, because I go unto my
[50:36] father. And whatsoever you shall ask in
[50:39] my name, that will I do that the Father
[50:42] may be glorified in the Son. And if you
[50:45] shall ask anything in my name, I will do
[50:49] it." Amen. God bless you today. You can
[50:51] be seated.
[50:55] I'd like to speak to you this morning on
[50:57] unclogging the faith lines. Amen.
[51:00] Unclogging the faith lines. This this
[51:02] saying it's referring to or maybe a
[51:06] metaphor of removing the barrier or
[51:10] obstacle that is standing in the way or
[51:13] disconnecting you or disconnecting the
[51:16] connection of your faith to God.
[51:20] It is to clear out anything that hinders
[51:23] the flow of faith. So the word of life,
[51:26] the word can can breathe and have life.
[51:29] Amen. It's just like a heart. You know,
[51:31] a heart can get clogs in the arteries
[51:33] and and it can build up over time and if
[51:36] you are if they're left alone, we know
[51:38] is it would do what it would do cause a
[51:40] heart attack and it would seize up the
[51:42] heart and the beat of that heart would
[51:44] stop and and of course it would bring
[51:46] death to the body. But it takes a
[51:49] removing of the hindrance or the
[51:51] blockage so that the blood can flow as
[51:53] it should through the through the body
[51:56] and into the brain different organs and
[51:58] bring life to the to the body. You know
[52:00] there's many hindrances or blockages
[52:03] that can stop up the faith lines. Uh one
[52:07] blockage is uh relying on relying on
[52:10] yourself. You know believing that we can
[52:12] ne navigate through life on our own or
[52:15] you know and not really rely on God. And
[52:17] of course we end up getting oursel in an
[52:19] awful mess all the time. And and when we
[52:21] do it leads to more hindrances or more
[52:24] blockages of fear and an anxiety and
[52:27] fear and anxiety begins to dictate the
[52:30] actions in our life which leads to more
[52:32] blockages and more problems. And that
[52:35] and those blockages are negative
[52:37] thoughts and feelings and which allows
[52:39] negative emotions to guide you instead
[52:42] of being guided by faith based upon the
[52:45] word. Amen. and and then in in that
[52:47] negative emotion then despair sets in or
[52:50] bitterness or whatever and it begins to
[52:52] add to the hindrances and then our our
[52:55] focus gets on the wrong things. It gets
[52:58] on things that are around us and we
[52:59] begin to look for a way amen to maybe
[53:02] navigate a different way or to do
[53:04] something h some other way and we end up
[53:06] getting ourselves in in more and more of
[53:10] a situation. you know, we we begin to
[53:12] try to maybe look for a way to dig out
[53:13] of our situation on our own. But instead
[53:16] of looking at the word, we look at the
[53:18] issues and the circumstances that are
[53:21] around us. And you know, and we can see
[53:23] that all through the Bible. This is what
[53:25] Sarah was doing when when you know, they
[53:27] had a supernatural visitation that day
[53:29] is a as Abraham would look up and he
[53:32] would see these three men walking
[53:33] towards him. And we know there's many
[53:35] things hidden in the scriptures that he
[53:37] didn't say my lords, but he said my lord
[53:40] because there was only one God. Amen.
[53:42] But he he would he would begin to invite
[53:44] him into his home and he would begin to
[53:46] speak to him and and he begin to and God
[53:48] would begin to unveil to him what was
[53:50] about to take place in their life and
[53:52] and he would speak Sarah's name and he
[53:54] would tell that she was going to have a
[53:56] son. and Sarah, you know, instead of
[53:58] looking at what was going on and maybe
[54:00] not catching the significance of the
[54:02] moment of that supernatural visitation,
[54:04] it maybe was just another day and you
[54:07] know, and and and the prophet broke into
[54:08] this a lot and he said, you know, she
[54:10] was just in a mood that day and she she
[54:12] she wasn't expecting that that day would
[54:15] be the fulfillment or the promise or
[54:17] that would be a supernatural visitation.
[54:19] Maybe she looked out there and she
[54:21] didn't catch the significance of who was
[54:24] among her, who was who was visiting her
[54:26] that day. And and so when the voice
[54:28] begins to speak and it puts her in the
[54:30] promise, instead of her beginning to
[54:32] rejoice and thank God and and instead of
[54:35] her looking at what God was trying to
[54:38] portray to her, amen, doubt rose up in
[54:40] her heart and she be to laugh at what
[54:42] God had said. And you know, we do the
[54:44] same things. Amen. Amen. Last Wednesday
[54:46] night, we heard a wonderful message of
[54:48] of faith and deliverance of the proving
[54:51] time. And many times we see ourselves
[54:53] being put directly in the promise. But
[54:55] yet, we look at it and say, "Well, this
[54:57] is too much. This is too hard. This is
[54:59] too great. How could God do this?" But
[55:01] even God answered that question. He
[55:03] said, "Is anything too hard for the
[55:06] Lord?"
[55:07] Hallelujah. And I like to ask that this
[55:09] morning. Is there anything too hard for
[55:12] the Lord? So no matter the situation, no
[55:14] matter what the circumstances are, no
[55:16] matter what the problems, sicknesses,
[55:19] problems, financial struggles, children
[55:21] wayward, whatever it is, there is
[55:23] nothing that is too hard for the Lord.
[55:26] There is no situation that is too great.
[55:28] There is no sickness that is too great.
[55:30] There is no problem that is too great.
[55:32] There is no devil that is too big. Amen.
[55:35] for our God that can come down and
[55:37] remove every obstacle if we can get
[55:40] those lines of faith unclogged.
[55:43] Amen. Where God can move in that channel
[55:46] that he has ordained to move in. Amen.
[55:48] Many people begin to think, well, you
[55:50] know, if I only had faith, you know,
[55:52] faith faith isn't based on long drowned
[55:55] out prayer meetings. Faith is not even
[55:57] based on if you fasted enough. Faith is
[56:00] an unconscious thing. It's an
[56:03] unconscious thing. your real faith.
[56:05] You're unconscious of it. You don't know
[56:07] that. You don't even know the faith that
[56:09] you have.
[56:11] Come on, somebody. You don't even know
[56:14] the faith you have. Faith is there. It
[56:17] just have to get the channels open and
[56:19] the lines cleared and the connection
[56:22] from faith to the word that it may live.
[56:26] Amen. Could you imagine Jesus coming up
[56:29] to the moments that he faced in his life
[56:31] and question whether he had faith or
[56:33] not? Do I have faith to stop the winds?
[56:36] Do I have faith to steal the waves? Do I
[56:38] have faith to raise Lazarus up? He never
[56:41] questioned his faith. The first thing
[56:43] before we can, but the first thing
[56:44] before we can have faith, we got to have
[56:47] some foundation for faith. And we've
[56:48] been preaching on faith for a long time.
[56:50] And we know that faith only has one
[56:53] foundation. That is the word of God.
[56:57] Faith is not based upon an emotion.
[57:00] Faith is not based upon Amen. upon
[57:03] whether you like like I said emotion
[57:05] whether you feel good or you don't feel
[57:06] good. Whether it looks right or it don't
[57:09] look right. Whether the day is bright or
[57:11] it's cloudy, whether the sun is shining
[57:13] or it is not. Faith is only based upon
[57:16] the word. Not my word, not some
[57:19] preacher's word, not even the seventh
[57:21] messenger's word. It is based upon the
[57:23] word of almighty God.
[57:28] Amen. And so that's where you got to
[57:29] bring faith back to. That's where you
[57:31] actually that's where you got to bring
[57:33] everything back to. You got to bring
[57:35] your feelings back to the word.
[57:38] Amen. Because our our our what we feel
[57:40] can deceive us. There's a lot of things,
[57:43] you know, you feel you feel a lot of
[57:44] pressure sometimes. And brother Brandon
[57:46] would even talk about he said sometimes
[57:48] you have this feeling. He said you look
[57:50] at and you don't even realize that
[57:52] you're actually bumping into angels.
[57:55] And sometimes you might think that's a
[57:56] something go else going on. But
[57:58] meanwhile, angels are all around you. It
[58:01] happened in the Bible. I mean, we know
[58:03] the prophet of God was there and the
[58:05] Syrian army surrounded him. There was a
[58:07] lot of feelings going through that
[58:08] servant's heart.
[58:11] There was a lot of anxiety and a lot of
[58:13] fear and a lot of things that were going
[58:15] on in that moment. Amen. But the prophet
[58:17] looked around. He said, "Hey, what are
[58:18] you worried about? There's more with us
[58:20] than there is against us." And he said,
[58:22] "Well, what are you talking about? What
[58:24] are you saying? How how can you say
[58:25] that? Do you not see that big old army?
[58:27] He said, God opened this boy's eyes. And
[58:30] he said, when his eyes came open, he was
[58:32] able to look along the hill line and
[58:34] there was chariots of fire and angels of
[58:37] fire all around that prophet.
[58:40] I want you to understand those same
[58:42] angels are still in attendance today.
[58:46] They are still around the people of God
[58:48] and they're still standing there and
[58:50] they're still waiting to be amen to be
[58:53] ordered to move on your behalf.
[58:59] But our faith lines get clogged up and
[59:01] all we can see is Syrians and we can see
[59:04] problems and sickness and situations and
[59:07] what we can see with these two eyes and
[59:09] and and our faith eyes gets clouded over
[59:12] and we can't see past our own hands.
[59:14] Sometimes it gets so dark and gets so
[59:17] impossible. But you know, we got to come
[59:20] back to the word in those moments. You
[59:22] got to come back to the word. You don't
[59:24] you don't we're not relying on a on a
[59:26] certain gift, but we believe in gifts.
[59:28] We're not relying on certain things or
[59:30] certain emotion. We believe in emotional
[59:33] emotional religion. We believe in all
[59:35] those things. I don't believe in a dead
[59:37] one.
[59:39] Amen. But I believe in one that's got
[59:40] life in it and and a response in the
[59:43] body. Amen. I believe in those things.
[59:44] Amen. But you know when a man when he
[59:46] chooses a life companion, you know,
[59:48] he'll he'll look at her life we and so
[59:50] forth and and what what what the family
[59:53] is and who she's from and what's her
[59:55] background and so forth. And and we have
[59:57] to, you know, he got to have something
[59:59] that he can have a basis upon. And then
[1:00:02] he asked her, you know, the only thing
[1:00:04] he can take is her word. That's the only
[1:00:05] thing he can take. That's all she can
[1:00:07] take from him is his word. There's no
[1:00:09] other way around it. And then we know
[1:00:11] some some men have broken their
[1:00:13] promises. Some women have broken their
[1:00:14] promise. But I'm so glad that God has
[1:00:17] based it in such a way that we can just
[1:00:20] take his word.
[1:00:22] And he has never broken a promise.
[1:00:26] He never has broken a promise. Did he
[1:00:28] not fulfill it in Sarah's life? He said,
[1:00:30] "I'm going to return at the right time,
[1:00:32] in the right season, at the right
[1:00:34] moment, and you're going to have a son."
[1:00:37] It didn't matter how much she doubted
[1:00:38] and how much she laughed. God was going
[1:00:40] to fulfill his word anyhow. And it
[1:00:43] doesn't matter how many people laugh
[1:00:45] about a rapture or body change or or or
[1:00:48] a supernatural thing. It doesn't matter.
[1:00:50] God's going to fulfill his word anyhow.
[1:00:55] People can laugh at supernatural things.
[1:00:57] They can make fun of it. They can down
[1:00:59] it. They can do whatever they want to.
[1:01:01] God's going to fulfill his word.
[1:01:05] But you know, God when he made man in
[1:01:07] the beginning, you he made him the the
[1:01:09] God of the earth and he he gave him
[1:01:11] jurisdiction over everything on the
[1:01:14] earth to control and he controlled the
[1:01:16] animal life. He controlled the foul and
[1:01:18] the fishes of the sea. He controlled the
[1:01:20] winds. He controlled the plants. He he
[1:01:23] controlled everything. And he was made
[1:01:25] as a as a as it were a secondary god
[1:01:27] upon the earth. He was given the power
[1:01:29] to control everything, all elements.
[1:01:31] That was Adam. Adam was given those
[1:01:33] great powers and then this power that he
[1:01:36] was given. Amen. You know, he but he had
[1:01:38] a choice and we know the choice that he
[1:01:40] made. But you know, Adam could speak to
[1:01:42] the winds and it would stop. He would he
[1:01:44] would speak to trees and they would obey
[1:01:46] him. He would speak to wildlife and it
[1:01:49] would obey him. He would speak to water.
[1:01:51] Whatever it was, everything obeyed Adam.
[1:01:55] This was the beginning of man. That's
[1:01:57] what God gave him the power to have over
[1:01:59] all the earth. But through the fall, he
[1:02:02] lost that power. He became unconscious
[1:02:06] to the fact after losing the
[1:02:07] relationship and the friendship with the
[1:02:10] father. Amen. Things begin to happen.
[1:02:12] All the great channels that he once
[1:02:14] operated in and he once had a direct
[1:02:17] line and it was clear between him and
[1:02:19] the father. It became clogged up and he
[1:02:22] couldn't get through as it were before.
[1:02:26] You know, Abra Adam had never been sick.
[1:02:28] He had never he would never had to die.
[1:02:31] He never had to worry. He never had a
[1:02:33] heartache. Could you imagine a life like
[1:02:35] that?
[1:02:37] Could you imagine a life like that?
[1:02:40] That's where we're going back to.
[1:02:42] Amen. We woke up in this world full of
[1:02:44] worries. I mean, you know, maybe a baby
[1:02:48] may not be able to voice what he's
[1:02:49] worried about, but you can tell he's
[1:02:50] worried. He's worried if he's going to
[1:02:51] get to eat again.
[1:02:54] He's worried about this and worry starts
[1:02:56] at a very young age.
[1:02:58] And he begins to go and this but a life
[1:03:01] he never worried. He he just climbed up
[1:03:03] in the arms of his father like a child.
[1:03:05] Everything was his. Whatever he asked,
[1:03:07] he got it. Everything obeyed him because
[1:03:09] he was God's child. And as a child, he
[1:03:12] was heir to it all. But he fell and he
[1:03:15] lost this. Amen. In other words, all the
[1:03:18] plumbing, amen, as it were, in the brain
[1:03:21] and and the outlets that that faith used
[1:03:23] to move and operate through had become
[1:03:26] clogged up with business affairs and
[1:03:28] home life and and domestic things. And
[1:03:31] it all became clogged up with until God
[1:03:34] can't operate through those channels
[1:03:36] anymore un that he made man for unless
[1:03:39] they are opened up by the word of
[1:03:42] almighty God.
[1:03:45] When God made the human body, every
[1:03:48] little part had a play. Every part had a
[1:03:51] part to play. The teeth, the tongue, the
[1:03:54] eyes, the nose. God does everything in
[1:03:56] there to make it perfect in operation.
[1:03:58] And so God so patterned the man, the
[1:04:00] body, the man. How much has he also
[1:04:03] patterned and set in the order? The body
[1:04:05] of Christ, the church. If he designed
[1:04:08] man's body, he has certainly designed
[1:04:10] the body of his son, the church. He has
[1:04:12] designed us to come together in heavenly
[1:04:14] places. He has designed us to have
[1:04:16] supernatural workings of God among us.
[1:04:19] Come on, somebody. I'm a direct quote.
[1:04:22] He has designed us to have those work,
[1:04:24] those outlets, those gifts of the
[1:04:26] spirit, prophecy, and wisdom and
[1:04:28] knowledge and gifts of healing, all
[1:04:30] these other different gifts. It's
[1:04:31] outlets that God lets his power through.
[1:04:35] But Satan wants to clog them up.
[1:04:38] He wants to clog them up to keep the
[1:04:40] power of God out of the church and out
[1:04:43] of the people. Amen. You know, just like
[1:04:46] as it were, the veins of your body
[1:04:48] become clogged, it's keeping the power
[1:04:50] and the bloodline, the blood, the flow
[1:04:53] that brings life and oxygen to the rest
[1:04:55] of your body. If you can just get one
[1:04:57] spot clogged up, amen, people can lose a
[1:05:00] limb. They can they can lose all kinds
[1:05:02] of thing because of a a artery becoming
[1:05:04] clogged with something. And this is what
[1:05:06] has happened even in the body of Christ,
[1:05:08] in the body of believers. Amen. A things
[1:05:11] begin to get clogged up by ideas or isms
[1:05:15] or theologies or psychologies, whatever.
[1:05:18] And it clogs something up and that part
[1:05:20] of the body dies.
[1:05:25] God has placed these things that we can
[1:05:27] have a connection to him. You know,
[1:05:30] brother Brandon will make something a
[1:05:31] very a very wonderful thought here. He
[1:05:34] said, "Satan by his power, he makes his
[1:05:37] laws work in man." Now, he said, "By his
[1:05:40] power, he makes his laws work." He said,
[1:05:43] "How much more ought God in his power
[1:05:46] make his laws work in man?"
[1:05:49] If Satan can make his laws be so sure
[1:05:52] and us recognize them, how much more
[1:05:55] ought God through his children make his
[1:05:57] laws to be recognized among his people?
[1:06:00] Amen. Divine healing, revelation, power,
[1:06:03] gifts, manifestation of the spirit. The
[1:06:06] law of sin and death works in people.
[1:06:08] But the law of the liberty of Christ has
[1:06:11] also come that we can be free from the
[1:06:14] law of sin and death. Amen.
[1:06:21] You know, the the natural types of
[1:06:22] spiritual.
[1:06:24] I I I I I I think it's quite interesting
[1:06:26] in this time that we're living in where
[1:06:29] we're at and we know we're at the end
[1:06:30] time. We see prophecies being fulfilled
[1:06:32] all around us and among us. And every
[1:06:35] day we see things in the news that just
[1:06:37] lining more prophecies up.
[1:06:40] And just yesterday, you know, we we went
[1:06:42] over there and bombed them nuclear sites
[1:06:44] and and and and it's all over the news
[1:06:47] now that that nobody, no other nation,
[1:06:50] no other one, nobody, no other military
[1:06:53] could do what we did yesterday. And you
[1:06:56] read about it, Revelations 13, which
[1:06:58] speaks about the United States, the
[1:07:00] beast, amen, with two horns. And it
[1:07:02] comes up and it talks about how the
[1:07:03] whole world wonders at that beast
[1:07:05] because how it rains fire down from
[1:07:07] heaven.
[1:07:10] And I thought here here here this nation
[1:07:12] is being recognized as she is the only
[1:07:15] one that could bring death.
[1:07:19] Come on somebody. She's the only one
[1:07:22] that could do this job. She's the only
[1:07:24] one that could bring these bombs to this
[1:07:26] certain location and and with a certain
[1:07:29] way of doing it and go down deep enough
[1:07:31] to root out the enemy. She's the only
[1:07:33] one. Well, I want you to understand
[1:07:35] there's another people on this earth
[1:07:36] that are the only ones. Amen. Come on.
[1:07:40] If the law of sin and death can work,
[1:07:42] then the law of liberty can also work.
[1:07:45] We see the law of sin and death working
[1:07:47] and and prophecies being fulfilled. But
[1:07:49] there's also another prophecy of another
[1:07:52] woman.
[1:07:54] Amen. The law of the liberty of Jesus
[1:07:56] Christ is also working in. And she's the
[1:07:59] only one that the power of the rapture
[1:08:02] is going to work through and is going to
[1:08:04] change her body.
[1:08:10] You're saying we're the only ones going
[1:08:12] to be saved. That's not what I said.
[1:08:14] Said we're the only the bride is the
[1:08:16] only one going in the rapture.
[1:08:18] There's going to be a many a multitude
[1:08:20] without number that's going to be saved
[1:08:21] in the great tribulation and white
[1:08:23] throne judgment and given eternal life.
[1:08:27] But somehow, you know, we people get off
[1:08:28] on a tangent on that and think we preach
[1:08:30] this gospel that we're the only ones
[1:08:32] that can be saved. We're not the only
[1:08:33] ones that's going to be saved. Well, we
[1:08:35] are the only ones that's not going
[1:08:37] through the tribulation.
[1:08:39] That's a pretty good savings right
[1:08:41] there.
[1:08:43] Amen. He said, I I believe, brother,
[1:08:46] said like this. I believe we're nearing
[1:08:48] the age when people are going to
[1:08:50] recognize these things. Come on,
[1:08:53] somebody. We've been so through so much
[1:08:56] vain philosophy and teachings that ought
[1:08:58] not to be until it set the human mind to
[1:09:01] a revolution of thinking on matters of
[1:09:03] this and that and taking it away from
[1:09:04] the word of God. As I've said, faith
[1:09:07] doesn't come by fasting. Faith doesn't
[1:09:10] come by praying or reading books. All
[1:09:12] that's good, fasting, praying, reading a
[1:09:14] book. But faith comes by something that
[1:09:16] is settled down in the human heart and
[1:09:19] tells you just as sure as you come to
[1:09:21] church this morning, I'm going back
[1:09:23] home.
[1:09:25] Come on, somebody. I wonder if you have
[1:09:27] that same assurity that the same as I
[1:09:30] came from my father, I'm going back to
[1:09:32] my father. Just as the same as I got up
[1:09:36] this morning and I drove to the house of
[1:09:38] God, I'm going to go back.
[1:09:41] Yes, sir.
[1:09:44] faith,
[1:09:46] you know, it's not all about, well, I
[1:09:48] kept this rule and I kept that. That's
[1:09:51] where Satan wants to keep you on rules
[1:09:53] and regulations.
[1:09:59] You, you know, you just unconsciously,
[1:10:01] you'll unconsciously, how many, well, I
[1:10:04] mean, I hope there ain't nobody in this
[1:10:05] condition. You go out to your car after
[1:10:08] service and you're worried about whether
[1:10:09] it's going to start.
[1:10:15] I ain't going to ask hands to be raised.
[1:10:18] Just go out there. Matter of fact, I
[1:10:20] don't have to put the key in it no more.
[1:10:21] Just push the button.
[1:10:24] Got to have the key still. A little fob,
[1:10:26] you know. But you just push the button.
[1:10:28] I I don't worry about it. I've never one
[1:10:30] time thought, is this thing going to
[1:10:33] start?
[1:10:34] Not not not in my vehicle that I had
[1:10:36] faith in. Now, I've been in some other
[1:10:38] things I didn't have faith in, and I
[1:10:40] wondered if it's going to start,
[1:10:44] like a steel weed eater.
[1:10:48] People brag all about steel weed eaters
[1:10:50] and steal this, it'll steal your money
[1:10:52] is what it'll do.
[1:10:56] But they're the hardest things to start.
[1:11:00] You
[1:11:02] and they just want to throw it off and
[1:11:05] go get me something different.
[1:11:07] But in my car, I ain't never had that
[1:11:08] worry. I' I've never got in there and
[1:11:10] said, you know, I now there's been times
[1:11:12] I got in there and pushed the button or
[1:11:13] turned the key and it didn't start. But
[1:11:15] it wasn't I wasn't worried about it. He
[1:11:18] said, "This is exactly how it is. That's
[1:11:20] what faith is. You don't you you never
[1:11:22] move, you know, you don't worry about
[1:11:25] it. You just go out there and you start
[1:11:27] the car. It's become so accustom that
[1:11:30] this law is going to work. It's a
[1:11:32] natural thing. It becomes a custom in
[1:11:35] your life that when I go put my key in
[1:11:37] it and I turn it, it's going to start
[1:11:39] up. When I go and I put my gas pair, I
[1:11:43] push the gas, it's going to go forward.
[1:11:46] Amen. When it becomes you become so
[1:11:48] accustomed to that law working in your
[1:11:51] life that you don't even think about it
[1:11:53] no more. I thought, oh God, how much
[1:11:55] more greater would it be if we come
[1:11:56] accustomed to the supernatural working
[1:11:59] in our lives that we ain't worried about
[1:12:01] if it's going to work. We ain't worried
[1:12:02] about if his word's going to heal. We
[1:12:04] ain't worried about if his word's going
[1:12:06] to save. We ain't worried about it if
[1:12:08] he's going to return the prodical home.
[1:12:10] His word works.
[1:12:12] His word works. And it just needs
[1:12:15] somebody with some faith to start it up.
[1:12:20] Isn't what brother Brandham did when he
[1:12:22] was here. He gave us a car. As we heard
[1:12:24] from our pastor many times, he uses this
[1:12:26] analogy a lot. Amen. But he gave us a
[1:12:28] car. Amen. It wasn't just sitting there
[1:12:30] pretty and beautiful and shining the
[1:12:32] hubs and doing a wax job, but it would
[1:12:34] actually start. It had power to go down
[1:12:38] to divine healing. It had power to go
[1:12:40] down to thus sayeth the Lord. It had
[1:12:42] power in it.
[1:12:45] And it still has power in it.
[1:12:52] There's power enough in that car to run
[1:12:54] over anything,
[1:12:57] you know.
[1:12:59] I'm going to probably hurt some people's
[1:13:00] feelings right now because people get
[1:13:03] all this animal rights stuff in their
[1:13:05] mind. But I'm going to tell you right
[1:13:06] now, when I'm on the highway and that
[1:13:09] poor little beautiful bunny rabbit runs
[1:13:11] out in front of me, I ain't about to
[1:13:13] dodge.
[1:13:15] Oh, I heard it. Please don't hurt the
[1:13:18] rabbit. Listen, what you're going to do
[1:13:19] is you're going to dodge that rabbit and
[1:13:21] you're going to hurt yourself.
[1:13:25] Hello.
[1:13:27] You you I've seen this happen over and
[1:13:29] over. I have people that's gotten some
[1:13:31] terrible wrecks, kill people because of
[1:13:33] some little bunny rabbit or some little
[1:13:34] dog, some little cat, whatever kind of
[1:13:36] animal runs out in front of them. They
[1:13:38] get scared or they don't want to hurt it
[1:13:40] and they turn the wheel too sharp or
[1:13:41] turn it and they hit something else and
[1:13:43] cause all kind of problems. Listen, we
[1:13:46] got we got it's such a you got to get it
[1:13:49] inside of you that your life is greater.
[1:13:53] It's worth more. I know this world don't
[1:13:55] teach it that way. This world has
[1:13:57] changed it to where animals are greater
[1:13:59] than humans
[1:14:01] cuz I promise you, you go out there and
[1:14:03] do something to some eagle eggs or some
[1:14:04] kind of protected something, you'll be
[1:14:06] throwed under the jail, but you can go
[1:14:07] kill all the babies you want to kill.
[1:14:11] Hello, somebody. That is the laws of sin
[1:14:13] and death that are working and it's
[1:14:15] going through Satan's Eden. And it
[1:14:18] really it tries to infiltrate our minds
[1:14:20] until we're so worried about some little
[1:14:22] animal that we'll kill ourselves over
[1:14:24] it. I'm getting somewhere. Amen. Because
[1:14:27] this power that we're driving is greater
[1:14:30] than the thing that is in front of us.
[1:14:34] Come on, somebody. Amen. It's time you
[1:14:36] quit worrying about hurting the devil's
[1:14:39] feelings or hurting what he thinks or or
[1:14:41] stirring him up or causing a problem.
[1:14:43] Just run over his hide. Amen. It's time
[1:14:46] you get rid of that thing in your life
[1:14:48] and say, "I've got something greater
[1:14:50] that's living on the inside of me than
[1:14:52] what comes across my path."
[1:14:58] I've used this before, but I just hear,
[1:15:00] "Well, well, when we did have a bridge
[1:15:02] in Louisiana, we used to come this way.
[1:15:08] It's been about five years. State of
[1:15:10] Louisiana, please get it fixed."
[1:15:14] But here we are. But we used to come to
[1:15:16] this back road and I enjoyed it because
[1:15:17] you see all kind of wildlife. You see
[1:15:19] just a good country road and when all
[1:15:21] these red lights
[1:15:26] and so you just listening to a tape or a
[1:15:28] song or whatever, just enjoying it. And
[1:15:31] I'm coming to preach one Wednesday night
[1:15:32] and I look up just in time to see this
[1:15:34] snake come out across. And before I
[1:15:36] before I could even do anything, which I
[1:15:38] probably wouldn't any I know I wouldn't.
[1:15:40] I just right over it. Heard him pop.
[1:15:46] And I said, "Well, I I didn't see him I
[1:15:48] didn't see him coming like that, you
[1:15:51] know, kind of halfway to myself." And
[1:15:53] Sister Ruth sitting next to me, she
[1:15:54] said, "I think the bigger thing is he
[1:15:56] didn't see you coming."
[1:16:00] I thought that's pretty good.
[1:16:04] Amen. When you realize when the devil
[1:16:06] for he realized that you done got
[1:16:08] something. It ain't you no longer
[1:16:10] depending on your own strength and
[1:16:11] ability but now you're inside of a
[1:16:14] power.
[1:16:16] He stepped out in front of you before
[1:16:18] and he stopped you but this time he
[1:16:21] steps out in front of you and you run
[1:16:22] over his hide. Amen. That's what needs
[1:16:25] to happen this morning. You know that
[1:16:27] devil has stepped out time after time.
[1:16:29] Well, get enough of Jesus. Get enough of
[1:16:32] Christ on the inside. And the next time
[1:16:34] he steps out, it won't be no dodging
[1:16:36] around him. You'll run right over him.
[1:16:40] There is a power here that'll run right
[1:16:43] over cancer.
[1:16:45] It'll run right over every sickness and
[1:16:48] every disease and every situation.
[1:16:55] Problem is, you get the wrong tinkering
[1:16:57] mechanics
[1:16:59] and get all kind of stuff messed up.
[1:17:02] car won't run no more.
[1:17:05] But there's one who knows how to put it
[1:17:07] exactly right.
[1:17:13] You know, he said if we could just throw
[1:17:14] oursel completely to God and his will
[1:17:17] and be lost to our own thoughts and just
[1:17:20] let the mind of Christ be in us, them
[1:17:23] same operations of the spirit will work
[1:17:26] through us just as the natural things
[1:17:29] do.
[1:17:33] Wow.
[1:17:34] Just as you going out there and going
[1:17:40] just throw oursel completely to God. How
[1:17:42] many's willing to do that? And to his
[1:17:44] will and be lost to our own thoughts and
[1:17:47] let the mind of Christ be in us, them
[1:17:50] same operations of the spirit would work
[1:17:53] through us just as the natural things
[1:17:56] do. just the same thing because we were
[1:17:58] first created for that purpose to
[1:18:02] control, to rule, to praise God, and to
[1:18:05] live for God.
[1:18:08] Do you understand what he's saying? He
[1:18:09] said that devil was not built to control
[1:18:12] you. You were built to control that
[1:18:14] devil.
[1:18:16] That sin was not there to rule you. You
[1:18:19] were made to rule that sin. That
[1:18:22] sickness was not put in your life for it
[1:18:25] to rule you and rule your mind and rule
[1:18:27] your body. It was put there that you
[1:18:29] could put it under your feet and rule
[1:18:31] it.
[1:18:34] Jesus said, "If you abide in me and my
[1:18:36] words abide in you, you can ask what you
[1:18:38] will and it shall be given to you. If
[1:18:42] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:18:43] you."
[1:18:46] What's he speaking about? The Holy
[1:18:47] Ghost.
[1:18:51] Well, I got to abide in the word. Well,
[1:18:52] you know how you abide in him is the
[1:18:54] Holy Ghost. You know how he abides in
[1:18:57] you is the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:02] He and his word is inseparable
[1:19:05] because the word is him. In the
[1:19:07] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:19:08] God and the word word was with God and
[1:19:10] the word was God and the word was made
[1:19:12] manifested made flesh and dwelt among
[1:19:15] us.
[1:19:17] God and his word is inseparable. You
[1:19:20] can't have God without having his word.
[1:19:24] And neither can you have his word
[1:19:25] without having God.
[1:19:31] In the beginning was the word. What is
[1:19:32] the word? The word is a thought
[1:19:33] manifested. It's a thought spoke. God's
[1:19:37] first God first. He perceived this
[1:19:40] thought and he spoke it and then that
[1:19:43] word became manifest.
[1:19:45] So everything that God has spoken, his
[1:19:47] word, received in the right channel,
[1:19:50] received in the right channel will
[1:19:53] materialize that word for whatever the
[1:19:56] promise is behind it. Come on. God will
[1:20:00] do it. He's obligated. Amen. If you
[1:20:02] abide in me and my word abide in you,
[1:20:04] then you can have God the word in you.
[1:20:07] And you believe the word just as you
[1:20:08] believe God because it is God and it is
[1:20:12] inseparable. Then if you have God's word
[1:20:14] in you, you have God's life in you. And
[1:20:16] if you have God's life in you, you have
[1:20:18] God's power in you.
[1:20:23] Then if you have God's word in you, you
[1:20:25] have God in you. And whatever God's word
[1:20:27] speaks forth out of you, it'll come to
[1:20:30] pass just like it was spoke from God.
[1:20:36] I got to get a drink of water on that
[1:20:38] one
[1:20:39] because I'm gonna say that again.
[1:20:43] because that happens to be a direct
[1:20:46] quote. He says, "Whatever God's word
[1:20:48] speaks forth out of you, it'll have to
[1:20:52] come to pass just like it was spoke from
[1:20:55] God."
[1:20:57] Jesus said, "Whatever you ask the Father
[1:20:59] in my name, that will I do." Do you
[1:21:01] realize what that means? Do you realize
[1:21:03] if we go before God in the name of Jesus
[1:21:06] is just the same as Jesus himself
[1:21:09] praying?
[1:21:11] It isn't me praying anymore. If I come
[1:21:13] in his name and he recognizes his name,
[1:21:16] he said, "Whatever you ask, I will do in
[1:21:20] my name."
[1:21:23] So when a when when a a representation
[1:21:26] of of of the US, you know, they don't go
[1:21:28] over there ambassador, that's the word
[1:21:30] I'm looking for. They don't go over
[1:21:32] there as of their own abilities or their
[1:21:34] own power. If they do, they're a fool.
[1:21:38] They go there in the name of the people
[1:21:40] or their government, whatever, of the
[1:21:42] United States of America. And so Paul by
[1:21:45] abiding to that it's just when they
[1:21:47] speak is as if America is speaking. And
[1:21:51] it's the same as we when we are now
[1:21:53] ambassadors of Christ here upon this
[1:21:55] earth. We're not we're not we're not
[1:21:57] speaking in our name. If we do in our
[1:21:59] own abilities, it may or may not come to
[1:22:02] pass. It may or may not happen. But when
[1:22:06] it's God's word that is spoke, it's
[1:22:09] going to come to pass.
[1:22:15] Now, people get that mixed up sometimes
[1:22:17] because especially it's a weird time
[1:22:19] we're living in because, you know, you
[1:22:20] can pray for somebody and they'll come
[1:22:22] back to you and say, "What? When you
[1:22:24] said this, what does this mean?" Well, I
[1:22:27] was just praying and I was speaking the
[1:22:28] word of God. Go to the word of God and
[1:22:30] go lay your faith there,
[1:22:35] right? Amen. We We were just
[1:22:37] interceding. for trying to move into
[1:22:40] that channel of faith to believe that
[1:22:42] God's going to move for your situation.
[1:22:44] Now, God may speak very directly. He may
[1:22:47] do that. I don't know how how he'll
[1:22:49] operate, but he's done it before. Amen.
[1:22:51] But the main point is don't depend on
[1:22:54] somebody else's prayer.
[1:22:58] Whether so and so laid his hands on me
[1:23:00] or not, or whether so and so said
[1:23:02] something to me or not, whether so and
[1:23:04] so did this or didn't do that, it
[1:23:06] matters not. What matters is God's word
[1:23:08] said it.
[1:23:11] Amen. We This is what we got to tie
[1:23:13] ourselves to. It's not if I got prayed
[1:23:15] for because you know you can get prayed
[1:23:17] for and you can go back and you can feel
[1:23:19] worse.
[1:23:21] But that doesn't change the that God's a
[1:23:23] healer or is the word doesn't make it
[1:23:25] false.
[1:23:26] His word is still true.
[1:23:37] He said the only thing that hinders
[1:23:40] today the human race today from being
[1:23:42] superior and controlling like they did
[1:23:44] in the beginning is because the power
[1:23:47] lines or the outlets of God made in
[1:23:50] human beings has been clogged up.
[1:23:53] Sometimes theology sometimes church
[1:23:55] doctrine sometimes ideas. So whatever
[1:23:58] clogged up your faith lines where I
[1:24:00] brought this text from clogged up your
[1:24:02] faith lines. Clogged up your lines till
[1:24:05] you have been taught that these things
[1:24:07] can't be that puts a block in there. He
[1:24:10] said, "Could you imagine this building
[1:24:12] being energized tonight for light by
[1:24:13] electricity? Electricity is an unseen
[1:24:16] force. But when it's harnessed and
[1:24:17] brought down, it brings light." You
[1:24:19] know, Benjamin Franklin, he he found it.
[1:24:21] He screamed, "I got it." But he didn't
[1:24:23] know what he had. And along came Edison
[1:24:24] and he he figured out how to put it to
[1:24:27] work. Benjamin, frankly, he felt it.
[1:24:31] But he know how to put it to work.
[1:24:34] We don't want to just feel this unseen
[1:24:37] force. We want to know how to put it to
[1:24:39] work.
[1:24:41] Amen. We want to be a conductor of it.
[1:24:43] We want to be a light show. As brother
[1:24:45] Brandon would say, he said, "When it is
[1:24:47] wired up correctly, it'll bring forth
[1:24:49] light.
[1:24:55] He said now you know only machinery can
[1:24:57] catch it and bring and bring it but it's
[1:24:59] a force. He said now if the natural laws
[1:25:02] of God which electricity and things once
[1:25:05] harnessed in the right capacity can do
[1:25:07] those things how much more could the
[1:25:10] power of the Holy Ghost once tossed in
[1:25:12] the human heart by faith. What can it
[1:25:15] do?
[1:25:18] Well, today there was one time that this
[1:25:21] up here right there, look up there.
[1:25:25] Y'all see them lights?
[1:25:28] Everybody see them? Okay. That used to
[1:25:31] be a supernatural event
[1:25:36] because for hundreds and thousands of
[1:25:38] years it was light a candle.
[1:25:42] But all of a sudden, you can just go
[1:25:43] right over there and just flip a switch
[1:25:46] and light up.
[1:25:49] Could you imagine the first people who
[1:25:51] saw that?
[1:25:53] It fried their brains.
[1:25:56] How is this working? How is this
[1:25:58] happening? How is this going on? How is
[1:26:01] this going? How how how?
[1:26:04] But today, we don't even think about it.
[1:26:09] We're so accustomed to it. We're so
[1:26:11] accustomed to electricity that the
[1:26:13] lights can be out. Have a storm, lights
[1:26:15] will be out. And I guarantee you'll
[1:26:16] still go in your room and you'll still
[1:26:18] try to flip them all.
[1:26:20] I've done it.
[1:26:22] So accustom. It's a It's a natural thing
[1:26:24] now. It used to be a supernatural thing,
[1:26:26] but now it's so accustomed to us that
[1:26:28] it's a natural thing for this to be. We
[1:26:31] don't think about it no more. Now we're
[1:26:34] entering into things now that are
[1:26:35] supernatural things. It's like, "Wow,
[1:26:37] how's this happening?"
[1:26:39] But it won't be long those things will
[1:26:41] be natural.
[1:26:44] It used to be a natural thing for
[1:26:47] healing to flow through a church.
[1:26:50] It was a natural thing for the
[1:26:51] supernatural to be present.
[1:26:55] It was a natural thing for the power of
[1:26:57] God to come down and change a life.
[1:27:03] But too many times it's become somewhere
[1:27:05] where it's like, "Wow, we had a great
[1:27:06] service. It was amazing." Well, why
[1:27:08] ain't every service amazing?
[1:27:11] Why ain't it a natural thing anymore?
[1:27:13] When the supernatural pours out, when
[1:27:16] the power of God comes down and it
[1:27:18] changes lives and it moves and it heals
[1:27:21] and it delivers, how come that is not a
[1:27:23] natural thing?
[1:27:29] Because things get clogged up.
[1:27:32] He says we as Christians become too
[1:27:34] clogged.
[1:27:36] We just can't understand or we're
[1:27:39] thinking about it, you know, about the
[1:27:41] word. But the doctor said, "I can't get
[1:27:44] well. We get that's a clog."
[1:27:48] And as long as you think that, you're
[1:27:50] not thinking God's thoughts.
[1:27:53] Amen. You can't do it. If you say,
[1:27:55] "Well, I'm going to die." The doctor
[1:27:56] said, "I'm going to die." All the best
[1:27:58] regards to the doctor. That's the best
[1:28:00] of his knowledge. If he said you're
[1:28:02] going to die, that's humanly speaking.
[1:28:06] And he said, 'You know, but the word, he
[1:28:09] said, maybe by humanly speaking, I
[1:28:10] believe that I believe that yeah, we're
[1:28:12] all going to die. He said, but by the
[1:28:14] word, I don't believe it.
[1:28:16] That's right. Because he promised me
[1:28:18] that whatever I ask the father in his
[1:28:20] name, it would be granted. And I believe
[1:28:23] that's the truth.
[1:28:26] If God can just clear out those little
[1:28:28] channels and run that energy out to the
[1:28:31] right places, then something's going to
[1:28:33] happen. The whole body is set together
[1:28:36] to operate in and his life to move
[1:28:38] through. Just as sure as it takes every
[1:28:40] member of my body to operate and give me
[1:28:42] life, so does it take every member of
[1:28:44] the body of Christ to operate together
[1:28:47] to bring it to life.
[1:28:49] This is what happened on the day of
[1:28:51] Pentecost. They got all the clogs out of
[1:28:53] the way.
[1:28:56] Oh, there's no doubt a lot of clogs
[1:28:58] there. They had things against Peter for
[1:29:00] what he said and this over here for what
[1:29:01] he done. And they had all kind of
[1:29:03] discussions. No doubt. But the scripture
[1:29:05] said they begin to get in one mind and
[1:29:07] one accord. Whose mind? The mind of
[1:29:09] Christ. Amen. They begin to forget about
[1:29:12] all their little isms and what had
[1:29:13] happened and how they had did this and
[1:29:15] how they denied, how they had doubted.
[1:29:17] They begin to forget all about that and
[1:29:20] all of a sudden that last channel was
[1:29:22] open that the power of God could flow
[1:29:24] down. I said, "God, help us this morning
[1:29:27] to open up every channel,
[1:29:30] every place, every spot that the Holy
[1:29:33] Ghost can move through. God, don't let
[1:29:35] me be a hindrance."
[1:29:44] He said, "It's amazing." He said, "Just
[1:29:45] as we got light here, there's a little
[1:29:47] string that goes across the road yonder,
[1:29:50] and it brings light over there, and it
[1:29:51] goes across the road yonder and brings."
[1:29:53] He said, "But that's material material
[1:29:55] things." He said, "How the energy goes
[1:29:57] down to the wire and it produces exactly
[1:30:00] over there what it does here,
[1:30:03] right? Because it's the same wire. It's
[1:30:06] hooked to the same source. So it moves
[1:30:08] from over here and goes right over
[1:30:09] there. Powers Brother Aaron's powers
[1:30:11] other buildings." Amen. What is it
[1:30:13] doing? Doing the same thing it's doing
[1:30:14] here. Producing AC. Praise God.
[1:30:17] Producing lights. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:30:20] And it's doing the same thing over
[1:30:22] there.
[1:30:24] Unless something gets clogged up.
[1:30:32] So many avenues you could go here. He
[1:30:34] said, "A long as the wiring is put
[1:30:37] together right, it's going to bring
[1:30:39] forth light."
[1:30:41] He said, "I I believe that a lot of
[1:30:43] times in the wiring of God, it's the
[1:30:44] same with God's spiritual body on
[1:30:46] earth." He said, 'Excuse me, but we've
[1:30:48] had some plumbers get in instead of
[1:30:49] electricians.
[1:30:52] No offense to the plumbers here today,
[1:30:56] but honestly, you don't really want a
[1:30:58] plumber wiring your house. Neither do
[1:31:00] you want an electrician plumbing your
[1:31:01] house
[1:31:04] cuz they're probably going to get a
[1:31:06] shock where you ain't supposed to get
[1:31:07] one and get water where you're not
[1:31:09] supposed to get it.
[1:31:13] Come on. This is what happened. And he
[1:31:15] said, "Plumbers got in and they try to
[1:31:18] save them by water."
[1:31:20] I love how he does it. He said, "This a
[1:31:22] big thing for Baptists, you know, save
[1:31:24] them by water." By water, they're
[1:31:25] baptized and they're save. He said, "But
[1:31:27] if the body is correctly wired up and
[1:31:29] the father in heaven turns on that big
[1:31:31] master switch, something is going to
[1:31:33] rise up. Something is going to happen."
[1:31:36] That's if the body is po properly wired.
[1:31:39] And if you're properly taught and every
[1:31:41] five of your body's been lost in Christ
[1:31:43] and in his word, it's going to be a
[1:31:45] light show.
[1:31:49] Oh, but if you got theology or you got
[1:31:51] doctrines or you got some superstition
[1:31:54] or some unbelief, you got something
[1:31:56] that's stopped up somewhere, then the
[1:31:57] energy can never pull through it. It can
[1:32:00] never move through it. There's a break
[1:32:03] along the lines.
[1:32:05] But when you got a place where you're
[1:32:06] perfectly wired and the master
[1:32:09] electrician is okay by the ceiling of
[1:32:11] the Holy Spirit, the only thing is to
[1:32:13] turn on the switch.
[1:32:17] Oh my. How many remembers when their
[1:32:19] switch was turned on?
[1:32:23] When God by his tender mercy came down
[1:32:25] in your life and he really he saw that
[1:32:27] there were some wires that were t in the
[1:32:29] wrong spots
[1:32:31] and you were constantly flipping
[1:32:33] breakers.
[1:32:35] You'd try and it would just kick off and
[1:32:37] you'd give up and and then next thing
[1:32:39] you know you try to you get it back and
[1:32:40] you go again and try and what was wrong?
[1:32:43] There was something wired wrong.
[1:32:46] We were born in sin and iniquity shaped
[1:32:48] in iniquity. We were wired wrong from
[1:32:50] the beginning but God rich in mercy came
[1:32:54] down with his great hands of Jehovah.
[1:32:56] And he reached down into our hearts and
[1:32:57] he said, "Nope, this one belongs here
[1:32:59] and that one belongs there and that one
[1:33:01] belongs there. Now, angels, hit the
[1:33:03] switch.
[1:33:05] This one's ready to go.
[1:33:07] And the light switch was turned on. And
[1:33:09] the Holy Spirit could run down and
[1:33:12] energize that body. And it wasn't no
[1:33:14] longer a certain person living a Timothy
[1:33:17] Brut doing this or Timothy Brut doing
[1:33:19] that or whoever you may be this morning.
[1:33:21] But it was God rich in mercy
[1:33:23] orchestrating through your life and
[1:33:25] living out through the body.
[1:33:32] He says, "Listen to this." And this will
[1:33:34] this will really put us in our spots
[1:33:36] now.
[1:33:38] He says, "We are the light of the world,
[1:33:40] a city set on the hill that cannot be
[1:33:42] hid."
[1:33:45] And tonight, today, we ought to be
[1:33:48] ashamed of ourselves and honestly and
[1:33:50] humbly confess our unbelief before God
[1:33:54] and ask him to forgive us of how we
[1:33:56] represent him in this life. He is
[1:33:58] depending on us.
[1:34:01] Now listen to this. The Old Testament
[1:34:04] people did not have this blessing.
[1:34:10] You refer back sometimes to Elijah and
[1:34:12] to Moses and and the pe the great men of
[1:34:15] God and people of God ordained of God
[1:34:18] but yet not have the privilege that you
[1:34:21] have. They don't have this same
[1:34:23] privilege. They did not have the power
[1:34:26] given them to perform as you've got
[1:34:29] today.
[1:34:33] Hello.
[1:34:36] Yeah, we love to brag about Shamgar
[1:34:39] and this one and that one. All these
[1:34:41] great men, three Hebrew children,
[1:34:43] Daniel, but they stood there without the
[1:34:46] same power afforded to you.
[1:34:52] That's that's that's humbling
[1:34:56] because they stand there with such faith
[1:34:58] that we revere them as heroes today. We
[1:35:01] look back and we tell their stories and
[1:35:03] we tell about how God did this through
[1:35:04] them and God did that but yet they did
[1:35:06] not have the same afforded the same
[1:35:09] power to perform as you have to per have
[1:35:13] today. Amen. So, what would be our
[1:35:15] excuse?
[1:35:20] Huh?
[1:35:24] What about us when we want to give up?
[1:35:26] When it gets a little hard and things
[1:35:28] don't go quite our way and we get it, we
[1:35:31] get in the wsy wowsy woos.
[1:35:34] We get in the wsy wowy woos as it were.
[1:35:38] Well, I tell you what, I he just know
[1:35:40] you ain't going through what I'm going
[1:35:42] through.
[1:35:45] You ain't been here where I'm at,
[1:35:47] Brother Timothy. Nope. But you ain't
[1:35:50] been where I've been.
[1:35:54] Well, you don't you you don't go through
[1:35:56] things like our family goes through.
[1:35:58] Well, you don't go through things like
[1:35:59] our family goes through. We're none of
[1:36:02] us are exempt from going through things.
[1:36:06] I can promise you I don't always feel
[1:36:08] like getting up here and preaching. I
[1:36:10] don't always feel like getting up here
[1:36:11] and leading a singing,
[1:36:14] much less preaching.
[1:36:19] Don't always feel like going to church.
[1:36:23] Don't always feel like getting out of
[1:36:24] bed.
[1:36:29] But we've been afforded something
[1:36:31] greater than what they had. Yet they
[1:36:34] stood with great power and authority and
[1:36:37] said, "Oh, king, do what you want to.
[1:36:38] build it up how you ever we're not going
[1:36:40] to bow.
[1:36:42] I'm not going to bow to your pressure.
[1:36:44] I'm not going to bow to your nonsense.
[1:36:46] I'm not going to bow to that idol. Do
[1:36:48] what you want to.
[1:36:53] And even down through the dark ages.
[1:36:56] And listen, the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:58] was not restored into the fullness until
[1:37:00] today. That's right.
[1:37:03] Come on. Back like it was at the
[1:37:05] beginning today. So those down through
[1:37:06] the dark age, yes they were under
[1:37:08] anointing, but they stood there without
[1:37:10] the seal of the Holy Ghost on the
[1:37:12] inside.
[1:37:14] Sure they had a working of his spirit.
[1:37:15] They had sanctification, justification,
[1:37:17] whatever the gifts. They stood there.
[1:37:21] But we have been afforded
[1:37:24] the power of God.
[1:37:26] What ought to be in our hearts? How are
[1:37:29] we to stand against the ws of the devil?
[1:37:32] Amen. How are we be able to stand
[1:37:35] against lukewarmness and spirits of hell
[1:37:37] that wants to blow through and things
[1:37:39] that wants to take the power of God out
[1:37:41] of our lives? How much more should we be
[1:37:43] able to stand?
[1:37:48] If Satan's body can operate in unbelief
[1:37:51] and doubt and fears and produce what the
[1:37:52] scripture says it will, it produces
[1:37:55] sickness. It produces disasters. It
[1:37:57] produces everything. Unbelief, all these
[1:37:59] things. and people by unbelieving
[1:38:01] produce all of those things. Shouldn't
[1:38:03] people believing with the power of God
[1:38:05] harness these things and bring them
[1:38:08] back?
[1:38:10] What's he talking about? The word that's
[1:38:12] been left undone.
[1:38:14] Hello.
[1:38:16] Brother Brandon was not a reformer. He
[1:38:18] was a restorer. Right?
[1:38:21] He came to restore the power to the
[1:38:23] church.
[1:38:25] He came to put all the wires back
[1:38:27] together in the right spots. One day
[1:38:29] they was hooked to three gods or they
[1:38:31] was hooked to whatever all kind of
[1:38:33] theologies and ideas. They was hooked to
[1:38:35] days of miracles are passed. They was
[1:38:38] hooked to every kind of thing. He said,
[1:38:39] "Nope, that wire does not belong there.
[1:38:41] Let me put it back where it belongs."
[1:38:43] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:38:44] forever. He said, "No, that wire don't
[1:38:46] belong there. Let me put it back where
[1:38:48] it belongs." He's a Lord God that heals
[1:38:50] all our diseases. That wire don't belong
[1:38:53] there. If salvation was in the
[1:38:55] atonement, healing is also in the
[1:38:57] atonement.
[1:38:59] He put it all back to restore the body
[1:39:02] to the right position and the right
[1:39:04] place by house. Not just ideas or
[1:39:07] theology or just the word, but power and
[1:39:10] demonstration of the word.
[1:39:15] You can scream I got power all you want
[1:39:17] to and you go hit the light switch and
[1:39:18] it don't do nothing. I doubt if you
[1:39:20] really got power or there's something
[1:39:22] wrong somewhere.
[1:39:27] And I can tell you right now, if we're
[1:39:28] talking about the same word, you can
[1:39:30] say, "I got power." Or you want to, and
[1:39:32] hold on to it, and there not be some
[1:39:34] reaction inside of you. I doubt you got
[1:39:36] power.
[1:39:40] I've been I' I've touched it. I know
[1:39:43] it don't feel good.
[1:39:46] By God's grace, I live through it.
[1:39:49] Boomed up inside up in some three-phase
[1:39:51] one day and a switch not paying
[1:39:53] attention cut making some shortcuts.
[1:39:56] Should have been doing my safety pre
[1:39:57] protocols but I was trying in a hurry
[1:39:59] and a top of a switch hit me right there
[1:40:01] in the chest. 14,400 volts. Thankfully I
[1:40:05] was surrounded by the right equipment
[1:40:07] and I I wasn't grounded out and I just
[1:40:09] but let me tell you I knew there was
[1:40:12] power there.
[1:40:14] All kind of stuff happened in my body.
[1:40:17] Let me back up.
[1:40:21] because there was something that caused
[1:40:22] a reaction.
[1:40:24] There's something that happened. That's
[1:40:26] what electricity is. It's a power. It's
[1:40:28] an unseen force. And you say you got it
[1:40:30] and and you don't have there's no
[1:40:32] reaction. Well, yeah. I also doubt
[1:40:33] people that that say they got the power
[1:40:35] of the Holy Ghost and there's no
[1:40:37] reaction to it. There's nothing to even
[1:40:40] show or shine out or to to a fruit
[1:40:42] that's bore anything in their life. And
[1:40:45] you wonder, you got the power. You don't
[1:40:46] have the same one that Paul had.
[1:40:50] You don't have even the same one that
[1:40:51] same one that William Brandham had,
[1:40:53] which is the same one that Paul had.
[1:41:03] He said, "If not, we ought to be able to
[1:41:06] harness power God harness these things
[1:41:08] and bring them back to correction." He
[1:41:10] said, "Not what did Christ redeem us
[1:41:12] for?
[1:41:14] Why didn't he just make the atonement
[1:41:15] and say, "Now, there's no need of giving
[1:41:18] him these powers.
[1:41:20] There's no need of making this man a son
[1:41:22] of God. There's no need of doing that.
[1:41:26] I'll just ask him to believe
[1:41:29] and I'll write his name in the book of
[1:41:30] heaven and that'll settle it."
[1:41:34] But he gave us these redeemed blessings
[1:41:38] that we might operate the work of God by
[1:41:41] the energy of the Holy Spirit.
[1:41:45] He said, "I am the vine and ye are the
[1:41:47] branches." Do you know the vine can't
[1:41:49] bear forth fruit? It comes forth from
[1:41:51] the branch, but the same life that's in
[1:41:54] the vine must also be in the branch.
[1:41:58] if the branch is given forth a different
[1:42:00] fruit and it's a grafted in and it maybe
[1:42:02] you know as we know we heard we studied
[1:42:05] many times talked about it about the
[1:42:06] orange and the lemons that can be
[1:42:08] grafted into each other. Amen. But if
[1:42:10] that original tree ever puts out another
[1:42:12] limb, it's going to bear the life that's
[1:42:14] in that tree. Amen. If if this vine ever
[1:42:18] puts out another branch, it's going to
[1:42:20] bear the same life that was in the vine.
[1:42:23] Amen. So if you want to know the life
[1:42:25] that ought to be in this branch, you go
[1:42:27] look and study the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:29] He's the vine. We are the branches. So
[1:42:32] if he raised the dead, we ought to be
[1:42:34] able to raise the dead. If he healed the
[1:42:36] sick, we ought to be able to heal the
[1:42:37] sick. Not by our power, but by his power
[1:42:41] and his word.
[1:42:45] operating by the energy of the Holy
[1:42:47] Spirit.
[1:42:52] He says, "Now the vine with all the
[1:42:54] energy cannot produce anything unless
[1:42:56] the branch is willing to receive the
[1:42:59] energy."
[1:43:02] So I mean that tells me the Holy Ghost
[1:43:03] can flow through this building and
[1:43:06] there'll be branches sitting here
[1:43:07] unwilling to receive. They won't receive
[1:43:10] a thing
[1:43:12] because they got some blockage,
[1:43:15] some hurt, some pain that they have
[1:43:18] elevated above the word of God. Come on.
[1:43:22] This is what happens. Amen. When you can
[1:43:25] sit through a service and not receive
[1:43:27] something, there's a blockage.
[1:43:31] Can we agree with that? There's a
[1:43:33] blockage. It can be unbelief. It can be
[1:43:35] bitterness. It can be hurts. It can be
[1:43:37] all kinds of nonsense. There's a
[1:43:39] blockage there keeping you from
[1:43:41] receiving the energy that's coming in
[1:43:43] this room.
[1:43:44] You say, "Well, how do you know there's
[1:43:46] energy coming in this room?" Because his
[1:43:47] word said there is. His word said,
[1:43:50] "Where two or three are how many?" We
[1:43:52] got two or three here this morning.
[1:43:53] Where two or three are gathered in my
[1:43:55] name. Aren't you glad he didn't say two
[1:43:58] or three thousand or
[1:44:01] two or 300. He said two or three are
[1:44:04] gathered in my name.
[1:44:07] Not in the name of Tim Puit or Timothy
[1:44:09] Puit or not in your name. Not in Elen
[1:44:11] Light Tabernacles name, but in the name
[1:44:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ, I will be
[1:44:16] there also.
[1:44:19] So, there's an energy coming in this
[1:44:21] room. And if you're not receiving
[1:44:22] something, it's because you have a
[1:44:24] blockage.
[1:44:30] Now, he listen. He says, "God is
[1:44:33] depending on you as a member of his body
[1:44:38] to bear fruits of the vine or of his
[1:44:41] spirit."
[1:44:42] And now he's depending on you. Let's
[1:44:44] open up our channels. Let's let the Holy
[1:44:46] Spirit come in today and energize us and
[1:44:49] free us from all the fears and doubts.
[1:44:51] Then revival will come. Somebody said,
[1:44:53] Somebody said, "The power was only given
[1:44:55] to the apostles for these things." He
[1:44:56] said, "I'm not a historian, but I have
[1:44:58] read much history of the church
[1:44:59] history." He said, "I've never seen a
[1:45:01] time in all history of the world where
[1:45:03] there was ever there was a waves of the
[1:45:04] Holy Ghost that ever struck the church
[1:45:06] in a fiery revival, but what signs and
[1:45:08] wonders and miracles followed it. God
[1:45:11] healed the sick in every age, and he
[1:45:13] will continue to do it in every age."
[1:45:17] Hello, somebody.
[1:45:19] So, this might not be the time that the
[1:45:21] prophet of God is here,
[1:45:23] but did he do it in his time? What is an
[1:45:26] age? It's a time. Amen. and he did it in
[1:45:28] his time, but he's going to do it in
[1:45:29] every time, in every age, in every
[1:45:32] moment. Because if he don't, he's not
[1:45:34] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:45:41] But he'll only do it, now here's the
[1:45:43] key. He said, "God healed the sick in
[1:45:46] every age and will continue to do it in
[1:45:49] every age where people and churches are
[1:45:53] willing to let loose.
[1:45:59] Uh oh. Now we see who the blockage is.
[1:46:03] Where people are willing to let loose
[1:46:06] and let the Holy Spirit take control of
[1:46:08] their being.
[1:46:12] Hey, when doubts and fears are what's
[1:46:13] holding you, you're allowing it to take
[1:46:15] control of your being.
[1:46:19] Bitterness takes unforgiveness, whatever
[1:46:21] it is, you're allowing it to take
[1:46:23] control of your being.
[1:46:29] It was all through history. You can look
[1:46:31] at Martin Luther. He had miracles. John
[1:46:34] Wesley had miracles.
[1:46:37] Moody, Sanki, Finny, all those men,
[1:46:40] waves of the Holy Spirit moving across
[1:46:42] this church, signs and wonders, things
[1:46:44] were taking place, the Holy Spirit
[1:46:47] moving. So many people being healed,
[1:46:49] testifying.
[1:46:51] He said, "And they weren't even being
[1:46:53] taught divine healing.
[1:46:56] He said, "But the Holy Spirit will do
[1:46:58] itself." The Holy Spirit will do it
[1:47:00] itself. If he can ever get right away in
[1:47:04] you, it will produce what it's to
[1:47:07] produce.
[1:47:09] See, God don't change. He's still the
[1:47:10] same. He uses avenues. He He uses a
[1:47:14] choice. He uses a place, a a channel.
[1:47:17] But we got to open it up.
[1:47:20] And that's what we got to do. We we we
[1:47:22] can't what what good does it do to get
[1:47:24] out of bed, drive to church, walk into
[1:47:28] church, pick out a pew, go through the
[1:47:31] motions, sing songs, and we never open
[1:47:35] up our channel to receive.
[1:47:38] What good does it do?
[1:47:42] We never open up the channel.
[1:47:46] He said, "What you got to do? You got to
[1:47:47] dig out all the clogs."
[1:47:49] The channel is here, but they have to be
[1:47:52] opened up. And they were all opened up
[1:47:55] at Calvary.
[1:47:58] He opened up every channel.
[1:48:01] And they'll be open today if we'll get
[1:48:03] the stuff out of the way. All of our
[1:48:05] unbelief and believe that God is still
[1:48:08] God.
[1:48:10] How many can believe that this morning?
[1:48:12] Amen. We started out this morning. God
[1:48:14] is still God and he'll be God forever.
[1:48:18] Come on, somebody. If you can just get
[1:48:20] that little thought in your mind right
[1:48:22] now. I wish we could all just get that
[1:48:24] right now. Forget about tomorrow. Forget
[1:48:26] about what's going on across the world
[1:48:28] and you can't do nothing about it
[1:48:30] anyhow. Forget about all of it. Just get
[1:48:33] this in your mind. God is God. Listen,
[1:48:39] if we can just pump that into our beings
[1:48:41] right now and realize he's still God, no
[1:48:43] matter if I'm up, whether I'm down,
[1:48:46] whether I'm going through a trial,
[1:48:48] whether I'm in the middle of sickness,
[1:48:49] whether I'm in torment, doesn't matter.
[1:48:52] He's still God.
[1:48:55] And if he's still God, he's still in
[1:48:58] control. And he can move the mountains
[1:49:00] for my sake. He can open up the Red Sea.
[1:49:03] He can rain down food out of heaven. He
[1:49:05] can give me water in the desert. He can
[1:49:08] do whatever he wants to do cuz he's
[1:49:10] still God.
[1:49:12] [Applause]
[1:49:16] When he came down, he immorate himself
[1:49:21] and a man called Jesus.
[1:49:24] And he would speak these words, "Yet a
[1:49:25] little while, and the world won't see me
[1:49:27] no more. I'll be veiled to them, but
[1:49:30] you're going to see me."
[1:49:33] Oh my God. I'm so thankful to be a
[1:49:36] person that can see him today.
[1:49:42] Why? Why? Why can't people just anybody
[1:49:44] see him? Because they're blind,
[1:49:47] wretched, naked.
[1:49:50] They got cankers over their eyes.
[1:49:54] As we heard the other day, the smoke of
[1:49:55] Sodom,
[1:49:57] smoke of hell burning in their eyes.
[1:50:04] Why? Why? Why can people
[1:50:07] God? You just see stuff sometimes you
[1:50:08] hope that ain't even real.
[1:50:11] People stand in the streets, little
[1:50:14] young people, pink hair, purple hair,
[1:50:17] and they're looking at authority and
[1:50:19] meowing at them like cats.
[1:50:21] Whoopdedoo.
[1:50:24] But they're insane.
[1:50:28] Insanity like never before,
[1:50:31] meowing like cats,
[1:50:34] barking like dogs.
[1:50:37] Why? Because, as we heard, the smoke
[1:50:39] that has infiltrated this world
[1:50:43] and it's blinding and it's got into
[1:50:45] their eyes. How many's ever sat around a
[1:50:48] fire pit? That's just a little tiny bit
[1:50:50] of smoke that can get you sometimes.
[1:50:53] They always say it follows the most
[1:50:55] beautiful person or I don't believe
[1:50:56] that.
[1:51:00] But anyway, it gets in your eyes. What
[1:51:02] does it do? It starts burning. Your eyes
[1:51:03] start watering. You start they start
[1:51:05] closing up and you start rubbing them.
[1:51:08] And it ain't just a little fire pit
[1:51:10] we're talking about. We're talking about
[1:51:12] the smoke from a bottomless pit. Yeah.
[1:51:15] Unimaginable amount of smoke that's been
[1:51:17] poured into this world and has blinded
[1:51:20] their eyes to the place that they they
[1:51:22] can't even tell if they're a man or a
[1:51:23] woman no more.
[1:51:26] They can't even tell, Amen, if it's
[1:51:28] right or wrong to kill a person, a baby.
[1:51:33] They can't even tell if if humans are
[1:51:35] worth more than animals.
[1:51:38] Hello. And it comes right in sometimes
[1:51:40] in our own thinking. Maybe not, Lord
[1:51:43] willing, to that degree, but it gets
[1:51:45] there. That's right. Cuz it's a smoke
[1:51:49] coming up and this is what has happened.
[1:51:52] It's come in and it's it's veiled God
[1:51:54] from their eyes. They'll look at God and
[1:51:57] they'll call it a a terrible name just
[1:51:59] like it did there. They call him
[1:52:01] Beelzebub. They they call him an
[1:52:03] illegitimate child. They call him
[1:52:04] everything but God.
[1:52:07] Deny his very existence.
[1:52:11] What blows my mind is those same people
[1:52:13] deny the existence of God but portray
[1:52:15] the existence of Satan.
[1:52:21] They'll talk about their devils and
[1:52:22] well, who you think even created it.
[1:52:27] The devil ain't a creator, but they've
[1:52:29] been veiled from God. But you'll see me.
[1:52:36] Oh, God. Why? Cuz he's got some eyes
[1:52:38] out.
[1:52:40] You'll see me. Amen. Because I'm going
[1:52:42] to put a little word across them eyes.
[1:52:45] And I'm going to wipe out that smoke and
[1:52:47] all that nonsense so you can see me.
[1:52:51] What a what a privilege we have this
[1:52:52] morning that we're not coming here
[1:52:54] seeing a bunch of nonsense of the world.
[1:52:56] We're seeing God unveiled among us.
[1:53:03] He's changed from Luther to Wesley and
[1:53:05] on and on from glory to glory. I'm still
[1:53:07] the same God. Going back to the original
[1:53:09] glory. Hallelujah. And he broke every
[1:53:11] denominational veil. Every sound bearer,
[1:53:13] that sound that says, "Oh, that's
[1:53:15] fanaticism." He broke right through it.
[1:53:17] That sound that come out there and said,
[1:53:18] "Oh, them people are crazy." He broke
[1:53:20] right through it. Oh, you can't do it.
[1:53:22] There's no such a thing. Bunch of
[1:53:24] fanatics. He broke right through it. No
[1:53:25] such a thing as divine healing. He broke
[1:53:28] right through it. For his word said he
[1:53:30] was. You cannot conquer the word of God.
[1:53:33] And there he stands yet tonight, the
[1:53:35] mighty conqueror. He broke every
[1:53:37] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, any
[1:53:39] other kind of veil. And he stands among
[1:53:41] us people today unconquered by
[1:53:44] traditions. Let people say what they
[1:53:46] want to say, do what they want to do,
[1:53:48] anything. God will break through every
[1:53:51] barrier.
[1:53:53] Oh, hallelujah. And remember, they tell
[1:53:56] me, he said, when a plane really breaks
[1:53:58] that sound barrier, there's no limit to
[1:54:00] where it can go. I'm telling you, when
[1:54:02] you break that traditional barrier, when
[1:54:04] you break that bitterness barrier,
[1:54:08] when you break through that barrier
[1:54:10] that's been holding you back for months
[1:54:11] and years now, whatever, you break
[1:54:14] through it and you find your way back to
[1:54:16] Jesus and you find he's the same
[1:54:18] yesterday, today, and forever. There's
[1:54:20] no limit to what God can do for you in
[1:54:23] that moment.
[1:54:26] Oh, hallelujah. We're talking about a
[1:54:28] God who has no limits.
[1:54:31] They want to brag about our nation has
[1:54:33] got a 20 foot long 30,000 lb bomb
[1:54:36] that'll go down 3,000 ft and it'll blow
[1:54:39] up uh the depths of the earth. Well, I'm
[1:54:41] telling you, there's a power that this
[1:54:43] God has that'll go down to the deepest
[1:54:46] parts of hell to wherever people are
[1:54:48] bound and it'll blow up hell and it'll
[1:54:50] set this violence, the violence, the
[1:54:53] sickest. It'll set them all free. Why?
[1:54:57] Because there's power in the name of
[1:54:59] Jesus Christ.
[1:55:02] But it's got to break through the
[1:55:03] barriers.
[1:55:08] That what do you think happens in a
[1:55:09] meeting? In a meeting is service
[1:55:12] building on service building on ser it's
[1:55:14] breaking down barriers. Then all of a
[1:55:17] sudden on a certain night sometimes
[1:55:19] it'll be a Friday night sometime be a
[1:55:21] Saturday morning. sometime whatever all
[1:55:23] said,
[1:55:28] "Wow, we had an amazing service." Well,
[1:55:30] God was there the whole time.
[1:55:36] Hitting that barrier. Hitting that
[1:55:38] barrier.
[1:55:43] I'm going to tell you, church, we've
[1:55:44] been hitting barriers here lately.
[1:55:47] People
[1:55:49] people have come come with barriers in
[1:55:50] their heart and they come with things in
[1:55:52] their life and they sit down there and
[1:55:54] they just quench the spirit of God and
[1:55:56] they just push it down. Why?
[1:56:00] Why let the anxiety worry? Why let the
[1:56:03] fear Why let the worry? Why let the
[1:56:05] sadness rule you? That's what not that
[1:56:08] wasn't who you was born to be ruled by.
[1:56:14] But I'm telling you, we're going to
[1:56:16] break through the barriers.
[1:56:19] We're going to break through every
[1:56:20] barrier there is known to man because
[1:56:22] we're going to take a body change.
[1:56:26] Come on, somebody. You think a good
[1:56:28] service is just such a great service cuz
[1:56:29] we had healings and we had deliverances
[1:56:31] and I love every last one of them. Come
[1:56:34] on, somebody. I love every service that
[1:56:36] we have those moments and we have the
[1:56:37] power of God come through the revelation
[1:56:39] of his word and break out. Listen, it

[1:56:43] in your seat. That's right.

[1:56:48] it has to happen at an altar. I believe
[1:56:50] in altars.
[1:56:54] But it can happen as the word goes
[1:56:56] forth.
[1:56:59] It happened for our brother up there. As
[1:57:01] the words went forth, things fell off
[1:57:03] his life. What happened? Barriers were
[1:57:05] broke. He had tried to break them for
[1:57:07] years on his own and he couldn't do it.
[1:57:09] Well, there came a power one Sunday
[1:57:11] morning and it broke through the veil.
[1:57:15] Come on, somebody. There's a power here
[1:57:17] this morning that's going to break
[1:57:19] through veils.

[1:59:54] Hallelujah. We're casting down
[1:59:56] imagination. We're casting everything
[1:59:58] that exalted itself above the word of
[2:00:01] God right now.

[2:00:05] worry.
[2:00:10] You've carried that thing like an idol
[2:00:12] from service to service and you walked
[2:00:14] in one Wednesday night with that idol
[2:00:16] and you went back home with that idol.
[2:00:18] But I ask you this morning, who believes
[2:00:20] in the power of the Holy Ghost? Who
[2:00:23] believes in the name of Jesus Christ is
[2:00:26] higher than all names? Then I tell you,

[2:01:42] Hallelujah.
[2:01:44] Hallelujah. Brother Random tells about a
[2:01:46] scientist who told him, I got on my
[2:01:47] notes, but I just preach it. He tells
[2:01:49] him about a scientist who told him about
[2:01:50] a dying Christian woman laying in a
[2:01:52] hospital. He said, "But there was enough
[2:01:54] power in her body as she was taking her
[2:01:57] last breath, she began to call out upon
[2:01:59] God, and they hooked up a meter to her
[2:02:01] to see what would happen." And he said
[2:02:03] it be to speak out that meter so far.
[2:02:06] The power that was laying in those
[2:02:07] words.
[2:02:10] He said there was light that was coming
[2:02:12] and it was they energizing that meter
[2:02:15] and it was peeking it out. He said we
[2:02:18] hooked it to infidels. He said it would
[2:02:20] not just peek it out. It wouldn't go up.
[2:02:21] It would go down as they would die. He
[2:02:24] said, "But that Christian woman," he
[2:02:26] said, "that body would pray and that
[2:02:28] meter would go up. It would pray and it
[2:02:31] would go up. It would pray and he said,
[2:02:33] "You don't understand what power lays
[2:02:36] inside the body of Christ." How many is
[2:02:38] part of that body right now? Well,
[2:02:40] there's power in the words that you
[2:02:42] speak if you speak the word of God.
[2:02:46] Now, I'm not going to hook you up to
[2:02:47] some meter, but I'm going to hook you to
[2:02:49] your brother and sister next to you.
[2:02:51] Amen. Let's begin to pray and let's
[2:02:53] begin to call upon God. And let's pray
[2:02:55] for husband and wife, brothers and
[2:02:57] sisters. Amen. The power of God may be
[2:03:00] revealed in their life. Amen. Right now,
[2:03:02] I curse every sickness. I curse every
[2:03:04] disease. I curse every spirit in the
[2:03:07] name of Jesus Christ. I curse the power
[2:03:10] of Satan that wants to hold God's
[2:03:12] people. You've held us by speed limits.
[2:03:14] You've held us by barriers, but today
[2:03:17] we're coming out in the name of Jesus
[2:03:18] Christ. Satan, take your hands off of
[2:03:21] God's property.

[2:03:41] it like the congregation did right
[2:03:43] there. I want you to say this. Say this

[2:03:57] me. God, forgive me my unbelief. I
[2:04:01] believe the gospel. I believe that you
[2:04:03] are here and I believe you are now
[2:04:05] performing.
[2:04:07] You're performing your word in my body.
[2:04:10] And I open up the channels. I empty out
[2:04:13] my unbelief. I receive your spirit. I
[2:04:17] believe that you are in me and I believe
[2:04:20] my sickness will vanish.

[2:04:26] when you are here? I believe you. I
[2:04:29] accept you as my healer and my
[2:04:32] deliverer.
[2:04:34] Glory to God. How many can accept him
[2:04:37] this morning? That's my healer you're
[2:04:39] talking about. That's my deliverer
[2:04:41] you're talking about. That's my Savior.
[2:04:44] That's my God.
[2:04:46] That's my King. That's my Lord. That's
[2:04:50] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:04:52] That's the same one Abraham saw.
[2:04:56] Same one he saw is the same one that's
[2:04:58] standing at your seat right now.
[2:05:02] Will you make him a cash sandwich? Will
[2:05:04] you make him welcome? Is there anything
[2:05:07] too hard for the Lord?

[2:35:26] Father, as we depart from this sanctuary
[2:35:28] today,
[2:35:30] this song is our confession.
[2:35:35] We invite you, Lord, to take full
[2:35:36] control and leadership of each vessel
[2:35:40] that's surrendered today to you.
[2:35:45] May we see things the way that you see
[2:35:47] them.
[2:35:49] May we react the way that you would
[2:35:51] react.
[2:35:53] May you have complete control.
[2:35:59] It's a willing surrender
[2:36:00] [Music]
[2:36:03] out of a love
[2:36:05] to do the will of the father. Not our
[2:36:08] will but thine be done.
[2:36:10] Thank you for the opportunity to be in
[2:36:12] the house of the Lord today gathered
[2:36:15] with saints of like precious faith
[2:36:18] to hear the word of freedom not of
[2:36:20] bondage.
[2:36:23] A day of liberty
[2:36:25] has been set before us. We'll walk into
[2:36:28] it in Jesus name. You're dismissed
[2:36:32] today. Give my life away.
[2:36:39] Give myself away
[2:36:43] so you
[2:36:44] can use me.
[2:36:47] Oh, my life is not my own.
[2:36:52] To you I belong.
