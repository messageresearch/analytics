[0:00] Glory to his name.
[0:04] Amen.
[0:06] Hallelujah.
[0:07] Hallelujah. Let the redeemed of the Lord
[0:10] say so. Why don't you say I'm healed?
[0:13] Why don't you declare I'm delivered? Why
[0:16] don't you declare my children are coming
[0:18] home? Why don't you declare, Amen, and
[0:20] wish to be there and her offspring with
[0:23] her? Why don't you declare, "Oh, the
[0:25] complexes is gone." Amen. The unbelief
[0:28] is leaving. I'm rising higher.
[0:31] Hallelujah. Declare it this morning.
[0:34] Declare it for your life. Declare it for
[0:36] your heart.
[0:38] Hallelujah.
[0:40] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Get rid
[0:42] of that unforgiven spirit. Get rid of
[0:44] that
[0:45] unbelief. Quit holding on to the grudge
[0:48] that's hold you down for years and
[0:49] years. Get rid of it. Surrender your
[0:52] life right now. Give it all to Jesus.
[0:55] [Music]
[0:57] Hallelujah. Get the monkey off your back
[1:00] this morning. Amen. You've held it too
[1:03] long. Something complex. Wanting to
[1:06] destroy your marriage, want to destroy
[1:07] your home. God wants you.
[1:10] God wants to heal you. God wants to
[1:13] bring deliverance.
[1:15] Hallelujah.
[1:17] [Music]
[1:18] Amen. Amen. Play softly that soft real
[1:22] softly. Glory to his name.
[1:27] I just want you to worship him just for
[1:29] a moment.
[1:31] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:35] Hallelujah. Let the Holy Spirit
[1:38] as it blows through you. Come on. You
[1:40] can't do like this and
[1:43] fly. You can't just hold it in. You have
[1:46] to start spreading those
[1:48] [Music]
[1:50] wings. The winds of the spirits, boy,
[1:53] don't resist it. Don't Don't hug up real
[1:56] close and make yourself small and and
[1:59] don't let him move
[2:01] you. Break
[2:03] out. Take those feeble hands that hangs
[2:06] down. Lift him
[2:08] up. Go to praise in the name of the Lord
[2:11] your God. And as the Holy Spirit moves,
[2:14] as the wind blows, jump off of that old
[2:17] low limb you've been
[2:19] on. Amen. Get out of those doldrums
[2:22] you've been in. Amen. Leave that old
[2:25] unbelief and the chattering of that old
[2:26] squirrel behind saying days of miracles
[2:29] are passed. You'll never do it. You can
[2:32] have the Holy Ghost. The promise is unto
[2:34] you. Can you get that revelation this
[2:37] morning? Unto you. Oh, it's also to your
[2:40] children. So, well, I have a really far
[2:43] off, brother Tim. Even to those who are
[2:45] far off. Oh, how long will that last?
[2:48] And as many as the Lord our God shall
[2:50] call, that's how long it lasts. As long
[2:53] as he's still calling, he's pouring it
[2:55] out.
[2:57] Amen. Moving to the winds.
[3:03] Down at the
[3:06] rock where my
[3:15] savior

[3:22] cleansing of
[3:24] sin
[3:25] I could.

[4:08] the front. Yeah. Come on, worship. Hands
[4:13] lifted. Come on. You got to move in the
[4:16] spirit. Can't resist the Holy Ghost.
[4:19] Can't be stiff necked. Can't single up
[4:21] like this. Amen. Reach out.
[4:25] There you all the way to the back in the
[4:31] mezanine of
[4:32] blood. Let's get in one accord right
[4:38] now. Oh,

[4:46] God like
[4:47] this. Amen. I'm singing

[5:04] Oh Lord, Lord, this good time to just
[5:08] repent and say, "Lord, have I done
[5:10] something, acted in ways I should, been
[5:14] unforgiven,
[5:16] unrepentant, stiff necked, hard-hearted?
[5:22] I'm going to apply the
[5:23] [Music]
[5:30] blood for
[5:33] glory
[5:35] to his.
[5:38] Can you say this? I'm so wondrously
[5:40] saved.
