[15:01] Church of brother George Martin he's
[15:04] gone home to be with the Lord
[15:08] leaves behind his wife sister Porsha and
[15:10] his grandchildren
[15:12] and just so many in that area it's been
[15:15] affected by the passing of
[15:17] a few different pastors recently and
[15:20] man I know it's a
[15:23] difficult thing to go through to lose
[15:25] somebody that's such a leader
[15:28] amen but that song we just sang was
[15:30] written by a man that lost four of his
[15:31] children

[15:35] other than to look up and say it as well

[48:06] living God
[48:07] we asked now to touch each heart we ask
[48:10] it in Jesus name
[48:13] foreign
[48:14] to Hebrews chapter 4. also First
[48:18] Corinthians 11.
[48:20] verse 23.
[48:22] amen we had a
[48:24] just a wonderful time just a way a few
[48:28] weeks ago and uh
[48:31] kind of interesting you know sometimes
[48:33] you think you got your plans made and
[48:35] the way things are going to happen and
[48:36] it don't always happen the way you
[48:37] expect and
[48:39] um so I was looking at tickets and
[48:41] things to try to fly to Brother Kelly's
[48:44] and for his winter convention and and it
[48:47] wasn't possible to get there on the day
[48:49] that I needed to get there and to go a
[48:51] day earlier was about it was ridiculous
[48:53] the amount the cost of it and so he
[48:56] actually suggested me to go to Vancouver
[48:58] and overnight and doing so it saved
[49:00] quite a bit of money and and so then I
[49:03] was there in Vancouver with the
[49:05] Believers there on Wednesday night and
[49:07] spoke on a little thought that I just
[49:09] had spoke here on the fire and and the
[49:11] fire of God fell and it touched you know
[49:14] several Hearts but there was one there
[49:16] young girl that had had just been
[49:18] through a lot in her life and she came
[49:20] down and she gave her heart to the Lord
[49:22] and the fire of God lit her up and she's
[49:25] went back a week later on her way back
[49:27] through and she just still all smiles
[49:29] and rejoicing for what God has done or
[49:31] life amen God knows how to direct your
[49:33] path amen and brother brother Tom got up
[49:36] behind what I'd said and he says you
[49:38] know you drop a match you'll burn a
[49:40] forest
[49:41] and I believe that's what we want to do
[49:43] every service just drop a match let the
[49:46] force burn and let God come that down
[49:48] and touch hearts and lives and had a
[49:50] wonderful time as well Brother Kelly's
[49:52] bring back greetings from for the Tom
[49:54] and brother Kelly there and all the
[49:56] churches the different folks in in each
[49:59] church and so many that can't name all
[50:02] the names that want to send back
[50:03] personal greetings but we just thank the
[50:06] Lord that we have family all over the
[50:07] world Amen we're thankful for that amen
[50:11] Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12 it says
[50:13] for the word of God is quick and
[50:16] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[50:19] sword piercing even to the dividing
[50:23] asunder of Soul and Spirit of the joints
[50:26] and the morrow and is the and it is a
[50:30] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[50:34] the heart sounds like a surgeon amen go
[50:37] right down into the soul and divide it
[50:39] right across from the soul and the
[50:40] spirit and the joints and Morrow and a
[50:44] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[50:46] the heart neither is there any creature
[50:48] that is not manifest in his sight but
[50:51] all things are naked and open unto him
[50:53] under the eyes of him with whom we have
[50:57] to do also First Corinthians 11 and
[51:00] verse 23 now we read the scripture for
[51:02] the communion but I just want to read it
[51:05] here tonight it says if I received the
[51:07] Lord that which I've delivered unto you
[51:09] that the Lord Jesus the same night at
[51:10] which he was betrayed took bread and
[51:13] when he gave thanks he break it and said
[51:16] take eat this is my body which is broken
[51:18] for you this do in remembrance of me
[51:21] after the same manner also he took the
[51:24] cup when he had sup saying this cup is a
[51:27] new testament in my blood this do you as
[51:31] oft as you drink it in remembrance of me
[51:33] for as often as you eat this bread and
[51:35] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[51:38] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[51:41] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[51:43] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[51:45] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[51:48] let a man examine himself
[51:50] and so let him eat of that bread and
[51:53] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[51:56] drinketh unworthodly eateth and drink a
[51:58] damnation to himself not Discerning the
[52:01] Lord's body for this calls many are weak
[52:04] and sickly among you in many sleep for
[52:06] if we would judge ourselves we should
[52:08] not be judged but when we are judged we
[52:11] are chasten of the Lord that we should
[52:13] not be condemned with the world
[52:14] wherefore my brethren when you come
[52:16] together to eat Terry one for another
[52:19] amen we'll let you be seated tonight
[52:23] uh
[52:24] I've had this thought on me for some
[52:27] time and just
[52:29] just looking into it
[52:31] I want to speak to you tonight on the
[52:32] light the discerner
[52:35] amen I believe he is the discerner of
[52:37] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[52:39] and he knows where our problems are and
[52:42] our problem spots are and he he you know
[52:45] we go to a doctor and we get a CAT scan
[52:47] and we get an MRI and sometimes it can
[52:49] pinpoint something and sometimes he
[52:51] can't even find the issue but this light
[52:54] can show exactly where it's at and he
[52:56] knows exactly how to go to where it's at
[52:58] and he knows exactly how to describe how
[53:00] to how to anoint a certain service and a
[53:03] certain man to come amen maybe thousands
[53:05] of miles away or just a few miles away
[53:07] and anoint them to go down a certain
[53:10] Avenue amen it's the light is the zerner
[53:13] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[53:15] and you know I I was just looking at
[53:17] this as we as we see that this this word
[53:20] is a powerful word that we have in this
[53:22] hour it's not a word of limitations it's
[53:25] not a word that can only handle certain
[53:27] certain situations and only do certain
[53:30] things but it's a word of unlimited
[53:32] resources and so therefore it has
[53:35] unlimited resources it has unlimited
[53:37] power now the doctor he has limited
[53:40] resources on how he can treat something
[53:42] in your life and he can only go so far
[53:44] but thank God he has never run out of of
[53:47] treatments God has never run out of his
[53:49] ability to heal and deliver and and to
[53:52] set free and and to break complexes off
[53:55] of Our Lives he knows exactly where
[53:57] every troubled spot is in our life and
[54:00] we know the word of God is strong is
[54:02] sharp it's very it's like a a scaffold
[54:05] that a surgeon would use him and a
[54:07] secured surgeon can go in and he can
[54:09] divide the muscle and the tissue and go
[54:12] and find that spot in your right maybe
[54:14] it's against the bone or maybe it's down
[54:16] hidden in some around your intestine
[54:18] somewhere but he knows exactly how to go
[54:20] in there but this God knows exactly how
[54:23] to how to bring a thought to a to a man
[54:26] and and lay it upon his heart and bring
[54:28] it to a certain spot so he can come to
[54:31] that moment where you need him at but
[54:33] see it's not just him coming to to that
[54:35] place and begin to discern your hearts
[54:37] but you also must recognize that's God
[54:40] doing that because if you look at it and
[54:42] say well that's just brother Timothy or
[54:44] that's just brother so and so or brother
[54:45] brother Tim told him what I was doing or
[54:48] this that and the other and you can very
[54:49] easily take that light and make it a
[54:51] very dim thing and and make it where it
[54:53] isn't very it isn't able to come and
[54:56] touch your heart it becomes a very
[54:57] carnal thing amen because of carnal
[55:00] interpretations and carnal ideas but you
[55:03] know if we'll look at it for what it is
[55:04] and we can truly see that is the light
[55:07] of God that God would come and he would
[55:09] anoint a man through the foolishness of
[55:11] preaching and he would he would anoint
[55:13] him to a certain thought into a certain
[55:15] thing and to a certain road to go down
[55:17] why because God knows where your trouble
[55:20] is God knows if his blindness God knows
[55:23] of his complexes God knows of his
[55:25] situations your life that you can't
[55:27] handle he knows exactly how to get to
[55:29] where you're at you know I I was I was
[55:32] even thinking on these things as I was
[55:34] away and you know know it's Friday night
[55:36] at that meeting their Brother Kelly's uh
[55:38] on Friday I was just Disturbed and
[55:40] didn't know what to preach on and was
[55:42] looking and looking and looking and
[55:43] finally hit this one one vein and just
[55:46] like the room lit up as I would as I
[55:49] would begin to look at this thought I'd
[55:51] spoke on who on who touched me and I and
[55:54] I brought it to the church that evening
[55:55] and and I began to speak and I and it
[55:58] wasn't very long I realized where I was
[56:01] at that I was in the mind of God and I
[56:03] knew that I was going down certain
[56:05] trails in certain Avenues and I I began
[56:07] to talk about the woman who touched the
[56:09] Hem of His Garment and how she was
[56:11] separated and out there away from the
[56:13] family of God but he had not only
[56:15] restored her body but he restored her to
[56:17] her position and you know and I was
[56:19] going down that line unbeknownst to me
[56:21] amen a visitor there and I'm benaughted
[56:24] brother Kelly he didn't even know the
[56:25] boy would be there but this boy came on
[56:27] this night and with his wife his boy
[56:29] been out of church for about 20 years
[56:31] and been gone and away from the Lord and
[56:33] and his family were his family had all
[56:36] Fallen apart and he'd married this girl
[56:38] out in the world and he said he said you
[56:40] know I I knew God was real but I I I
[56:43] just didn't know if it was for me and he
[56:46] marries this girl and down through time
[56:48] she gets diagnosed with MS and fear
[56:50] strikes them and they and he begins to
[56:53] become fearful and he says he tells his
[56:54] wife he said you know the doctors can't
[56:56] do nothing about this but I know a God
[56:58] who can and I know where he's at
[57:02] and he brings her to the house of God
[57:04] but before he comes he's in his room and
[57:06] he's crying out to God and he said God
[57:08] if I can only Touch the Hem of your
[57:11] garment if I can only come like that
[57:13] woman did and Touch the Hem of His
[57:15] Garment and he comes to that service and
[57:17] that's what I'm preaching on I begin to
[57:19] preach his very life to him I began to
[57:21] what was a man thousands of miles away
[57:24] but God was right there in his bedroom
[57:26] God was right there in my motel room as
[57:30] he would begin to speak to me and say
[57:31] this is what I want you to speak on this
[57:34] is how I want you to speak and this is
[57:35] where I want you to touch it why because
[57:37] he had a seed he had a son he had
[57:40] somebody there that had a need of a
[57:42] discerner
[57:43] because the word is still the discerner
[57:46] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[57:47] amen I believe we ought to believe we
[57:49] ought to believe that every service that
[57:51] is not just man it's not just brother
[57:53] Tim it's not just brother Aaron Brother
[57:55] job brother Timothy but it is God Veil
[57:58] behind human flesh speaking to our
[58:01] hearts and he's wanting to cut things
[58:03] out of our Lives now sometimes those
[58:05] surgeries are going to hurt sometimes
[58:07] it's going to be very painful sometimes
[58:09] it's going to take a little while to
[58:10] recover but God is speaking to you and
[58:13] if you'll take it as God's speaking to
[58:15] you then God can deliver you God can
[58:18] reach down and touch you in your inward
[58:20] places that nobody else knows about that
[58:23] nobody else is maybe concerned about
[58:25] nobody else you've ever told but God
[58:27] knows your inward places God knows the
[58:31] Deep secrets of your heart and he knows
[58:33] where to go get them and that boy come
[58:35] into prayer line that next night and he
[58:37] said you know he said I came here in
[58:39] Fair fear he said I bet I want to give
[58:41] my heart to God I want to serve a God
[58:43] who know knows my thoughts I want to
[58:46] serve a God who knows my very desire I
[58:48] want to serve a god who's alive like
[58:50] that I want to give my life to him he
[58:52] told Brother Kelly later he's in a text
[58:54] he said brother Kelly me and my wife
[58:56] came out of fear but I'm praying that
[58:58] out of faith we will stay that faith
[59:01] will keep us fear brought us but I pray
[59:04] faith will keep us
[59:06] Hallelujah because he is a discerner of
[59:09] the thoughts and intents of heart and he
[59:11] can bring somebody from miles away he
[59:14] can bring somebody from just right down
[59:15] there and mend it wherever it is to
[59:17] reach down into those dark places of
[59:20] your life and cut that thing out of
[59:22] there
[59:24] amen God's word is able to thoroughly
[59:27] examine Our Lives it can do what no
[59:30] other book can do
[59:33] you can read Dr Dobson you can read all
[59:36] kinds of things but if you read this
[59:37] word of God it'll do what no other book
[59:39] will do amen the penetrating power of
[59:43] God's word can probe the innermost
[59:45] aspects of our thinking
[59:48] amen I know I could ask for hands
[59:50] raising maybe we'll just do it how many
[59:52] has actually had a conversation or
[59:55] thoughts or things maybe on a Sunday
[59:56] morning or during the week and that the
[59:58] very next service it comes and repeat it
[1:00:00] back to you
[1:00:02] amen it happens all the time because the
[1:00:05] word is the discerner of the thoughts
[1:00:07] and intents of the heart so therefore it
[1:00:09] not only knows your thoughts it knows
[1:00:11] the intent of the thought it knows the
[1:00:14] motive that's behind it God's word
[1:00:15] discerns who we are and what we are
[1:00:19] amen God you make him fool your mom or
[1:00:22] your daddy or your pastor but you'll
[1:00:24] never fool the word of God the word
[1:00:26] knows who you are and what you are amen
[1:00:29] it can penetrate the full depth of your
[1:00:32] motivation
[1:00:34] amen it will go into your thinking and
[1:00:37] discern what is of God and what's not of
[1:00:40] God
[1:00:41] glory to God it penetrates our
[1:00:44] self-delusion and reveals it for what it
[1:00:47] is
[1:00:49] that is why we need to ask God to search
[1:00:51] our souls amen God search my heart oh
[1:00:55] God Amen God's word renders us without
[1:00:58] the ability to rationalize our sins away
[1:01:02] amen it reduces us to a place where we
[1:01:06] have no excuse
[1:01:08] so the word is a light it's a discerner
[1:01:11] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:01:13] he would he would speak about the word
[1:01:15] of God in Revelations 19 and verse 11
[1:01:17] said I saw heaven open and behold a
[1:01:20] white horse and he that sat upon him was
[1:01:21] called faithful and true how many is
[1:01:24] thankful for that and he and in
[1:01:26] righteousness he does judge and make war
[1:01:28] his eyes were as a flame of fire and his
[1:01:31] head were had many crowns in his name
[1:01:33] written and no nap no man knew but he
[1:01:35] himself and he was clothed with a Vester
[1:01:37] dipped in Blood and his name is called
[1:01:39] the word of God and the armies which are
[1:01:42] in heaven followed him upon white horses
[1:01:44] clothed and fine linen white and clean
[1:01:46] but out of his mouth goes a sharp sword
[1:01:51] what is it is the word of God is is the
[1:01:55] signified or symbolized as a sharp sword
[1:01:58] it goes and it begins to cut and it'll
[1:02:01] cut off sin it'll cut off unbelief it'll

[1:02:10] off cut off all things that are not of
[1:02:12] God
[1:02:15] amen out of his mouth goes a sharp sword
[1:02:18] and with it he shall Smite Nations he'll
[1:02:20] rule them with a rod of iron and tread
[1:02:22] at the wine press of the fearsen of the
[1:02:24] Wrath of the almighty God and he hath on
[1:02:27] his vesture on his thigh named written
[1:02:29] king of kings and Lord of lords amen we
[1:02:32] could see him over in the New Testament
[1:02:34] as he would come we we know we've been
[1:02:35] hearing about Sarah hey discerned her
[1:02:37] heart and a tent but we also see him
[1:02:39] Amen in the New Testament of how he
[1:02:43] would know their thoughts he would know
[1:02:44] what they were thinking even even in
[1:02:46] their minds they wouldn't even express
[1:02:47] it but he could see amen what they were
[1:02:50] even thinking in their minds and give
[1:02:51] them answers
[1:02:53] amen he was doing time after time and
[1:02:56] you know there was Nathaniel that would
[1:02:58] come to him and said wince though was
[1:02:59] thou me and Jesus answered said before
[1:03:01] Philip called thee when that was under
[1:03:04] the Fig Tree I saw thee so he's a
[1:03:07] discerner to the point he knows your
[1:03:09] address he knows where you are he knows
[1:03:11] what you're going through he knows what
[1:03:13] you've been through he knows your
[1:03:14] problem situation he knows your high
[1:03:16] mountains your deep valleys he knows all
[1:03:19] about you he knows when you're sitting
[1:03:21] in your doldrums and you're up shouting
[1:03:23] the victory he knows all of that
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:28] when you was under the Fig Tree I saw
[1:03:30] thee there it is when he comes that word
[1:03:33] will come against all nations and
[1:03:35] against all men and none will be able to
[1:03:37] stand against it it will reveal what was
[1:03:40] in every heart as it did in Nathanael
[1:03:42] the word of God will show who did the
[1:03:44] will of God and who didn't do the will
[1:03:47] of God
[1:03:48] amen amen it will make known the secret
[1:03:52] works of every man and why he did them
[1:03:56] and it will divide asunder
[1:04:00] amen this is the word of God Romans 2 3
[1:04:03] says and think as thou this o man that
[1:04:05] judges them which do such thing and does
[1:04:08] not the same that thou shall escape the
[1:04:10] Judgment of God then it goes on to say
[1:04:12] how God is going to judge men here it is
[1:04:15] in verse 5-17 a hard a hard heart will
[1:04:19] be judged The Works will be judged the
[1:04:22] motives will be judged there won't be
[1:04:24] any respect before God but all will be
[1:04:26] judged by that word no one escaping it
[1:04:29] those who heard and wouldn't listen will
[1:04:31] be judged by those by what they heard
[1:04:33] those that rested in it and saying they
[1:04:36] believed it but they didn't live it they
[1:04:37] will be judged every Seeker will come
[1:04:40] out in the open and will be shouted from
[1:04:42] the housetops oh we will really
[1:04:44] understand history then there won't be a
[1:04:47] mystery left throughout all the ages

[1:04:53] the secret will come out on the housetop

[1:04:59] what was of God and what was not of God
[1:05:05] but do you know that he's revealing the
[1:05:07] heart secrets of men and women in this
[1:05:09] age in which we're living
[1:05:12] who else could reveal the secrets of the
[1:05:14] heart but the word himself
[1:05:17] the word of God is quick and powerful
[1:05:19] and sharper and it's the discerner of
[1:05:22] the thoughts and intents of the heart it
[1:05:24] is the word it is performing where and
[1:05:27] unto it was sent for it the word is full
[1:05:30] of power
[1:05:32] Hallelujah it is the same spirit that
[1:05:35] was in Jesus the word that is present
[1:05:37] again in the church in this last age as
[1:05:40] a last sign trying to head the people
[1:05:42] off from judgment for they that reject
[1:05:45] him the word are now coming to judgment
[1:05:47] crucifying him afresh
[1:05:53] Paul said that the word came in power as
[1:05:56] well as voice
[1:05:58] the word preached will actually
[1:06:00] demonstrate itself
[1:06:03] it's not just some were empty words or
[1:06:06] red letters or you know I mean just read
[1:06:08] across the pulpit and just spoken and it
[1:06:10] falls off the edge and onto the floor no
[1:06:12] this word goes out and it will find
[1:06:15] somebody that it can demonstrate itself
[1:06:18] in amen this is a discerner it goes into
[1:06:21] places and it finds those that that have
[1:06:24] need the word preach it's like a flaming
[1:06:26] cutting sword and it went to the
[1:06:28] conscious of men like a surgeon's life
[1:06:30] and it'll cut out diseases and it'll set
[1:06:33] captives free everywhere those early
[1:06:36] Believers went they went preaching the
[1:06:38] gospel and God came behind it confirming
[1:06:41] his word with signs following the sick
[1:06:44] were healed Devils were cast out and
[1:06:46] they spoke in new tongues that was the
[1:06:48] word in action
[1:06:51] the word has never failed in the mouths
[1:06:55] of believing Christians
[1:06:59] amen and in this last stage it is here
[1:07:02] stronger and greater than ever in the
[1:07:05] true word bride
[1:07:07] Hallelujah you're a little flock your
[1:07:09] little minority hold on to the word fill
[1:07:12] your mouth and heart with it and someday
[1:07:15] God will give you the kingdom
[1:07:17] amen it is here stronger than ever than
[1:07:21] the true word bride amen if he was
[1:07:23] Discerning Earth 2 000 years ago he was
[1:07:25] a discerner in our age he's still the
[1:07:28] discerner now and is here stronger than
[1:07:30] ever
[1:07:32] it still cuts out amen the dark places
[1:07:35] of Our Lives it'll still set us sinner
[1:07:38] free it'll still cut off sickness off of
[1:07:40] their life the word is still a discerner
[1:07:54] but you have to
[1:07:56] dessert there's also something that you
[1:07:58] have to he's the discerner but you also
[1:08:00] have to discern
[1:08:04] you know it's easy to discern what
[1:08:07] others have but that's not what Paul was
[1:08:09] speaking about about Discerning the
[1:08:11] Lord's body he said you judge yourself
[1:08:14] lest you be judged so therefore we for
[1:08:18] you to receive something of God you have
[1:08:20] to receive it as something from God
[1:08:23] amen you have to discern it amen to say
[1:08:26] listen that just wasn't brother Timothy
[1:08:28] or brother Tim that was God speaking to
[1:08:30] me
[1:08:32] amen and there are many people they they
[1:08:34] cut it off and they say well it wasn't
[1:08:35] of God it was just him it was just he
[1:08:38] just got in the flesh and they missed
[1:08:40] While others are receiving they miss it
[1:08:42] because they did not discern the Lord's
[1:08:45] body
[1:08:46] amen when he was here 2000 years ago and
[1:08:49] he was Discerning the hearts and he was
[1:08:51] telling him what was wrong amen
[1:08:52] Pharisees were missing it
[1:08:55] they were calling him Beelzebub and he's
[1:08:57] just a mortal man and he's just a
[1:08:59] married son and he's an illegitimate
[1:09:01] child who are you to say what I can do
[1:09:04] and what I can't do we were not born of
[1:09:06] sin as you were
[1:09:07] they were Discerning him but they were
[1:09:09] risen they were not Discerning the body
[1:09:12] of the Lord
[1:09:15] therefore they missed him they thought
[1:09:17] it was just a carpenter's son and he
[1:09:19] just Mary's Boy and he's got Brothers he
[1:09:21] got sisters and who does he think he is
[1:09:23] and meanwhile the Lord's body is walking
[1:09:25] right to their midst and they're missing
[1:09:28] it
[1:09:29] and they're doing it again today
[1:09:33] 2 000 years ago I
[1:09:40] those that come and said oh thou son of
[1:09:43] David have mercy on me you would be
[1:09:45] exactly how you are now
[1:09:48] amen if you sit like a bump on the log
[1:09:51] and the Lord is Discerning it and he's
[1:09:53] speaking to your heart and you're saying
[1:09:54] Ah that's just brother so and so that's
[1:09:56] just the flesh that's just carnal that's
[1:09:58] just there amen and you miss it by not
[1:10:01] Discerning the Lord's body
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:09] foreign
[1:10:12] and the Lord discerned him
[1:10:15] called him by name
[1:10:17] said your name is Simon he came to Jesus
[1:10:20] sat down there in Jesus as soon as he
[1:10:22] comes in your name is Simon your son of
[1:10:24] Jonas
[1:10:26] he's uneducated no decree behind him he
[1:10:29] had nothing but just a common fisherman
[1:10:31] no education the Bible said it was
[1:10:33] ignorant unlearned but he became amen
[1:10:36] the bishop of the Church of Jerusalem
[1:10:37] why Jesus told him who he was what his
[1:10:40] name was what his father was he knew and
[1:10:43] then he knew that that was the word
[1:10:45] Peter then knew that was the word
[1:10:48] because it told him who he was he told
[1:10:51] him what he was doing he told him what
[1:10:53] he was going he was going the wrong way
[1:10:55] and he called him by name and
[1:10:58] established him in a place and therefore
[1:11:00] Peter knew because the Bible says the
[1:11:02] Lord your God will raise up a prophet
[1:11:04] like unto me and that had to be a
[1:11:06] prophet there is no prophets prophesied
[1:11:08] at the Malachi to the Messiah 400 years
[1:11:11] without a prophet and all of a sudden
[1:11:13] he's hearing your name is Simon you're a
[1:11:15] son of Jonah think of it it was proved
[1:11:18] to Peter that this is the Lord's body
[1:11:24] why didn't he prove it to Caiaphas
[1:11:27] he tried
[1:11:30] but Caiaphas wasn't here
[1:11:33] he couldn't get past the veil of Flesh
[1:11:36] he couldn't get past listen that is what
[1:11:39] the devil is constantly pointing you at
[1:11:43] let's just be honest because it's
[1:11:45] through the now God could anointed this
[1:11:47] Pulpit to preach the gospel a piano to
[1:11:49] preacher or a tree to preacher but he
[1:11:50] chose men to preach to men
[1:11:53] and so the devil wants to get in that
[1:11:55] and he wants to say well that's just a
[1:11:57] man
[1:12:00] true yeah I am just a man but behind
[1:12:03] that there is a voice that is speaking
[1:12:06] and it's speaking out and it begins to
[1:12:08] say things and it begins to go down
[1:12:10] Hearts lines and situations and it
[1:12:13] begins to minister and those that can
[1:12:15] discern it say hey that's not just
[1:12:17] brother Timothy that's the Lord's body
[1:12:19] that's God speaking to me that's God
[1:12:22] touching my heart that's god Set Me Free
[1:12:25] that's God delivering me that's God
[1:12:28] moving on my behalf that's God rich and
[1:12:31] mercy
[1:12:35] listen we are not getting mad when the
[1:12:37] preacher says something that we get all
[1:12:39] worried you know steps on our toes a
[1:12:41] little bit you ought to be happy when
[1:12:43] the preacher says something because God
[1:12:45] rich in Mercy thought enough about you
[1:12:49] he could have left you like Caiaphas but
[1:12:52] he called you Peter
[1:12:54] and he said come out from among them and
[1:12:57] be not worshipers of them and walk with
[1:13:00] me
[1:13:08] there's one standing in the midst he saw
[1:13:11] this
[1:13:12] so we're another man a few days later
[1:13:14] went and got his buddy around the
[1:13:16] mountain by 15 miles
[1:13:18] they was preaching brought him back the
[1:13:19] next day they were standing there
[1:13:21] amongst them and would come up to where
[1:13:23] Jesus was
[1:13:25] and Jesus looked
[1:13:27] he was God he had discernment that
[1:13:30] showed that making that was making the
[1:13:31] word he proved the word to him he said
[1:13:34] some of them say you know that that
[1:13:35] man's the word then priest said nonsense
[1:13:38] that guy ain't the word that can't be
[1:13:41] the word you know you know the scripture
[1:13:43] says the Lord Our God will raise a
[1:13:45] prophet up like to Moses and that's him
[1:13:47] listen to him
[1:13:50] I can't listen to him he's just a man
[1:13:52] he's Mary's son
[1:14:00] he turned to Nathanael and he says
[1:14:01] behold
[1:14:03] and Israelite
[1:14:04] in whom there is no God
[1:14:09] master
[1:14:11] how did you know me
[1:14:13] before you even came to church
[1:14:18] before you even drove the miles to be
[1:14:21] here I knew you
[1:14:24] foreign
[1:14:26] before you even while you was in your
[1:14:29] sour mood I knew you
[1:14:32] even when you was doubting I knew you
[1:14:35] even when you thought all hope was gone
[1:14:37] I knew you
[1:14:39] even when you thought it wasn't for you
[1:14:41] I knew you
[1:14:43] but not only do I know you I've called
[1:14:46] you to be mine
[1:14:52] Hallelujah the word is a discerner
[1:14:59] he knows exactly where you're at
[1:15:01] it was a little woman thinking there was
[1:15:03] a little woman at the well
[1:15:06] found herself in a bad situation seemed
[1:15:09] impossible that she would ever have
[1:15:10] anything from God
[1:15:13] been with been married five times living
[1:15:16] with a man that wasn't her husband
[1:15:18] but then the seventh man come
[1:15:21] and he's sitting on the well looks like
[1:15:23] just an ordinary man
[1:15:25] looks like not just anybody got a little
[1:15:28] hot seeking a good drink of water and
[1:15:30] shade maybe and he just sitting there
[1:15:32] looks like an ordinary man and she comes
[1:15:34] about to mind her business with her
[1:15:35] water pot and she begins to draw some
[1:15:38] water he said hey I would just give me a
[1:15:40] drink she said is it customary for a Jew
[1:15:42] to ask the Sumerian to give him a drink
[1:15:45] you know she got real real religious all
[1:15:47] of a sudden
[1:15:48] been married six times but she got real
[1:15:51] religious all of a sudden
[1:15:52] amen I've been in all kinds of things in
[1:15:55] her life but all of a sudden we're
[1:15:56] getting real religious
[1:15:59] and so that and so they began to begin
[1:16:01] to say she said well well you know he
[1:16:04] said woman if you knew who I was you
[1:16:06] would ask me for a drink
[1:16:09] and she looked at him and was like what
[1:16:11] are you talking about give me a drink
[1:16:13] you don't even have what I got I got a
[1:16:16] water pot
[1:16:18] you don't have no water pot you don't
[1:16:21] have what I've got
[1:16:23] I got more than what you've got what do
[1:16:25] you mean you're going to give me oh she
[1:16:27] was seeing was what was right before her
[1:16:30] and we know the story goes a little
[1:16:32] deeper as he would take her from there
[1:16:33] and she would he would begin to speak to
[1:16:35] her and said hey I believe you're a
[1:16:37] prophet
[1:16:38] and then he wanted to take her a little
[1:16:40] deeper and he said listen amen he began
[1:16:43] to tell her look you have you have the
[1:16:44] go get your husband she said I don't
[1:16:46] have a husband he said you said well he
[1:16:48] said because the man you're living with
[1:16:50] is not your husband you've had you've
[1:16:51] had five before and now the one you're
[1:16:53] living with is not your husband you said
[1:16:55] well she said I perceive you more than
[1:16:58] the prophet
[1:16:59] I perceive there's something more about
[1:17:01] you I know when the Messiah cometh he'll
[1:17:04] tell us all things and he said I am he
[1:17:08] nothing changed about him
[1:17:11] he looked exactly the same but the words
[1:17:14] came out of him but to her everything
[1:17:16] changed
[1:17:19] hallelujah amen the scripture was saying
[1:17:22] she left her water pot
[1:17:26] she left what she thought was so
[1:17:28] important that God had more than what
[1:17:30] God could offer but God showed her
[1:17:32] really quick I got more than that I got
[1:17:35] something that the world can't give and
[1:17:37] the world can't take away I'm a lawyer
[1:17:40] I've looked at a lot of Samaritan women
[1:17:42] and men that have left their water pots
[1:17:45] and have left their broken sisters that
[1:17:47] have left their governments and their
[1:17:49] Creeds and they're walking with Jesus
[1:17:53] amen nothing changed about him but what
[1:17:56] she saw changed
[1:18:04] that's what he wants to do
[1:18:06] he wants to change you
[1:18:09] we're all interested in changing
[1:18:11] everybody else
[1:18:14] well I tell you what brother brother the
[1:18:16] brother Pastor wouldn't say this and he
[1:18:17] wouldn't do that well listen God wanting
[1:18:20] to change you
[1:18:23] amen
[1:18:25] that's what the scripture says shall we
[1:18:28] go back to it
[1:18:32] examine let every man examine himself
[1:18:38] we want to examine everything is it of
[1:18:40] God is Not of God examine yourself
[1:18:45] find out if there's something on the
[1:18:47] inside of you
[1:18:48] that needs to change
[1:18:55] he said the reason why many are weak and
[1:18:58] sickly and some have went to sleep or
[1:19:00] died prematurely or brother Brandon
[1:19:02] would even say had went into spiritual
[1:19:04] death
[1:19:06] is because they failed to examine
[1:19:08] themselves
[1:19:10] they failed to discern they want to
[1:19:12] discern all the other things but discern
[1:19:13] yourself
[1:19:15] look inwardly and say hey is there
[1:19:17] something in me that needs to change
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:26] it's because he said because if we would
[1:19:29] judge ourselves then we should not be
[1:19:31] judged
[1:19:35] and when we're judged we are chastened
[1:19:38] to the Lord that we should not be
[1:19:40] condemned with the world
[1:19:42] hallelujah hallelujah so when we let the
[1:19:45] word judge us then we won't be judged
[1:19:47] with the world
[1:19:49] what we just read were all the thoughts
[1:19:51] are going to be shouted from the
[1:19:53] mountaintops and all the secret things
[1:19:55] are going to be revealed and nothing
[1:19:56] will be left in the dark amen if you'll
[1:19:58] let the word discern you and judge you
[1:20:01] now you won't be judged then
[1:20:10] he's a discerner
[1:20:17] but there stood priests there
[1:20:21] said heard all seen all these things
[1:20:24] seen many of the Miracles seen many of
[1:20:25] the signs see many of the Wonders he's
[1:20:27] nothing that's just nothing but
[1:20:29] Beelzebub
[1:20:31] I just I can't be God
[1:20:33] that's nothing but beelze above me
[1:20:40] they deserve it but these others that
[1:20:42] I'm speaking of the woman at the well
[1:20:43] and and the other subscription Nathanael
[1:20:46] and Peter they discern and recognized
[1:20:49] who he was
[1:20:50] others called in Bells above others
[1:20:53] called him names they couldn't because
[1:20:54] they couldn't discern this is the Lord's
[1:20:57] body
[1:20:59] they could discern the skies but not the
[1:21:02] one who made them
[1:21:06] and today as today they call it mental
[1:21:08] telepathy they call it mind reading they
[1:21:11] say today there's just a man or someone
[1:21:13] told him that couldn't be of God that's
[1:21:15] just brother so and so not Discerning
[1:21:17] that that is God the light the designer
[1:21:24] we must discern and judge ourselves lest
[1:21:28] we be judged
[1:21:30] and have respect for the body of Christ
[1:21:35] see
[1:21:37] people that don't come to the house of
[1:21:39] God why do they not come because they're
[1:21:40] not deserting the Lord's body
[1:21:44] they don't discern that's where God is
[1:21:46] they say Ah that's just Tim Pruitt's
[1:21:48] church or that's just this or that and
[1:21:50] the other and they fail to recognize the
[1:21:52] holy ghost moving Among Us
[1:21:58] hey we're gonna get a little sticky
[1:22:00] things for a minute but just bear with
[1:22:02] me Lord willing we'll make it out of
[1:22:04] here
[1:22:08] I challenge you go listen to the the
[1:22:10] sermon respects
[1:22:13] respect
[1:22:15] brother said respects is what we owe to
[1:22:17] God that's one thing I would like to
[1:22:19] drill this in the heart of every person
[1:22:22] that in all things we're going to own we
[1:22:25] must give respects to it we must respect
[1:22:28] it David said that when there were very
[1:22:30] few men of Israel perhaps Abraham Isaac
[1:22:33] and Jacob Jacob is speaking of very few
[1:22:35] men that are rebuked nations and Kings
[1:22:36] for them and God rebuked the nation and
[1:22:39] King saying touch not mine anointed and
[1:22:42] do my prophets no harm over in
[1:22:44] Ecclesiastes the 12th chapter the 13th
[1:22:46] verse it is written let us hear the
[1:22:48] conclusion of the whole matter fear God
[1:22:50] or respect God or have reverence to God
[1:22:53] and keep his Commandments for this is
[1:22:56] the full duty of all men
[1:23:00] the conclusion of the whole matter is to
[1:23:03] fear God is to respect his body to
[1:23:07] respect where he is that's why when we
[1:23:10] come into this place you know we try to
[1:23:12] keep it holy and and not talk and act up
[1:23:14] and chew gum and do all those things why
[1:23:16] because we're showing respect
[1:23:19] not to a man behind the pulpit not to
[1:23:21] those sitting in the Pew per se but yes
[1:23:23] we do that as well but but we're giving
[1:23:25] respect to the one who visits this place
[1:23:30] amen amen show and respect amen that's
[1:23:34] why we ought to be careful when we come
[1:23:36] brother go listen to The Taste after the
[1:23:38] end of the service when God will begin
[1:23:40] to deal with the hearts people wants to
[1:23:42] move around I understand you got to go
[1:23:43] to the bathroom got to go Gotta Go Gotta
[1:23:45] Go Gotta Go but then some moments the
[1:23:47] Holy Ghost is trying to go out and touch
[1:23:49] hearts
[1:23:51] we ought to have enough respect just to
[1:23:53] remain just a little bit and let God
[1:23:56] move
[1:23:56] [Applause]
[1:23:58] let him desire let him touch
[1:24:05] the conclusion of the whole matter is to
[1:24:08] fear God and when you can't have respect
[1:24:10] you can't have respect until you have
[1:24:12] fear you got to have the fear of God
[1:24:14] Solomon said also in Proverbs that the
[1:24:16] fear of God is the beginning of wisdom
[1:24:18] the fear of God is the beginning of
[1:24:20] wisdom the fear of God is the beginning
[1:24:23] of wisdom that don't mean that you're
[1:24:25] afraid of it it means you're given
[1:24:27] respect you're reverence in him and when
[1:24:30] you respect God you fear God and you
[1:24:32] fear that you might displease him in
[1:24:34] some way you fear unless you would do
[1:24:36] something wrong
[1:24:38] he said I want to fear my mother
[1:24:41] I want to fear my wife I want to fear my
[1:24:44] church I want to fear all gods in other
[1:24:47] words have respects
[1:24:48] God's servants unless I should put a
[1:24:51] stumbling block somewhere in their way I
[1:24:53] fear the lord I feel the fear of the
[1:24:55] people of the city unless I should do
[1:24:57] something wrong that would cause them to
[1:24:59] think that I wasn't a Christian
[1:25:03] see you have to have respects you got to
[1:25:05] have fear God demands it he demands
[1:25:08] respect God does that
[1:25:10] it's not man dictating this it's God
[1:25:14] demanding this
[1:25:18] and because he's God well then he
[1:25:20] deserves respect
[1:25:22] if you truly believe he's God
[1:25:24] and if you truly believe that he's in
[1:25:26] his people he deserves respect
[1:25:28] amen if you're truly Discerning the
[1:25:32] Lord's body
[1:25:33] amen we've got to respect him and give
[1:25:36] fear to him that brings respect God has
[1:25:38] demanded that for himself and for all
[1:25:40] his servants God demanded his respects
[1:25:42] for his servants how we know that
[1:25:45] they're his servants because he's
[1:25:46] Vindicated these servants by his word
[1:25:50] he vindicates it he takes these servants
[1:25:53] and makes them Servants of God and
[1:25:54] proves that their service by making his
[1:25:57] word work through them service then as
[1:25:59] you respect the servant you are
[1:26:01] respecting God
[1:26:03] amen so when I respect you and you
[1:26:06] respect me and we respect each other we
[1:26:09] are all respecting God
[1:26:12] we are Discerning the Lord's body
[1:26:18] did not Jesus say in as much as you've
[1:26:20] done to the least of these my little
[1:26:21] ones you've done it unto me be better
[1:26:24] for a millstone when hanging around your
[1:26:26] neck and you'd be drowned in the depths
[1:26:27] of the sea then to offend one of them
[1:26:29] but I say unto you that the Angels
[1:26:31] always behold my father's face in heaven
[1:26:33] and they'd be in children of God they
[1:26:35] are part of God God demands respect and
[1:26:37] then God chose whose his children are he
[1:26:40] shows it by wonders and signs and what's
[1:26:43] being done among them
[1:26:48] he brings out Noah and I'll just go
[1:26:50] through these very quickly
[1:26:52] Noah
[1:26:54] you know had a revelation from God that
[1:26:56] God was going to judge the Earth by
[1:26:58] water and to begin to preach and it was
[1:27:01] a
[1:27:02] quite of a long time of preaching 120
[1:27:06] years and the sermon never changed
[1:27:10] it's going to rain
[1:27:13] you better get ready
[1:27:15] God has provided a way there is a way of
[1:27:18] escaped you better get in this boat you
[1:27:20] better come you better be in here it's
[1:27:22] going to rain and they didn't show
[1:27:24] respect
[1:27:25] they did not discern that was the Lord's
[1:27:27] body
[1:27:28] they didn't discern that was where the
[1:27:30] word of God was working in their age in
[1:27:33] their time and it was God's word that
[1:27:35] would allow them to go above and beyond
[1:27:38] the tribulation that was coming on them
[1:27:40] and they failed to recognize this is
[1:27:42] more than just Noah this is more than
[1:27:44] just uh you know it's going to rain
[1:27:47] they begin to laugh and make fun and
[1:27:49] Jitter around and say ah it's a bunch of
[1:27:52] nonsense it ain't never rain it ain't
[1:27:53] never going to rain it never has rain
[1:27:58] they had no respect
[1:28:02] they would stomp out of his Services
[1:28:04] they would get mad they would say all
[1:28:06] kinds of things
[1:28:08] why because they failed to recognize
[1:28:18] he went about it but he just went around
[1:28:20] preparing his ark his golfers and
[1:28:22] markers came the Bible said there's
[1:28:24] going to be those in the last days too
[1:28:26] they're going to scoff at you
[1:28:28] they're going to make fun of you they're
[1:28:30] going to say it ain't so
[1:28:36] but God brought judgment on those
[1:28:38] scoffers because they would not listen
[1:28:39] to the messenger of God and come into
[1:28:41] the ark under his preaching then God
[1:28:44] sent his Divine judgments upon the Earth
[1:28:45] first he made a preparation for all who
[1:28:48] would receive it to escape it and then
[1:28:50] if he did not Escape it there was only
[1:28:52] one thing left and they wouldn't take
[1:28:54] God's preparation of Escape there was
[1:28:55] only one thing left that was divine
[1:28:58] judgment there's only two things
[1:28:59] available Mercy or judgment
[1:29:02] you have to accept one or the other
[1:29:04] that's where we all stand tonight and
[1:29:07] we're either going to take God's mercy
[1:29:08] are we going to take his judgment
[1:29:10] there's no way of getting around it one
[1:29:12] way or the other but God has made an
[1:29:15] escape for those who desire to escape
[1:29:19] and those have respect that this is the
[1:29:22] way
[1:29:29] Moses would come and
[1:29:33] they didn't think much of Moses because
[1:29:35] he was born there and raised up in
[1:29:38] Pharaoh's house and then they found he
[1:29:39] killed one Egyptian and ran off in the
[1:29:41] desert hiding for 40 years surely God's
[1:29:44] going to find somebody else but this was
[1:29:45] the one God chose
[1:29:48] can't help it sometimes God chooses
[1:29:50] people you don't like
[1:29:54] sometimes God chooses people you don't
[1:29:56] have a lot of confidence in
[1:29:58] it's true I mean he'll use people he'll
[1:30:01] do things
[1:30:07] or he'll use them and then you won't
[1:30:09] like them
[1:30:10] laughs
[1:30:12] yeah God will raise a man up and do
[1:30:16] certain things and here he comes with a
[1:30:18] message and many of them didn't respect
[1:30:20] him
[1:30:22] Pharaoh didn't remember what are you
[1:30:23] talking about huh you've been hiding out
[1:30:25] there you just killing you on you ran
[1:30:27] off what are you talking about let my
[1:30:28] people go
[1:30:30] and he throws down a rod and the three
[1:30:33] ten plagues come and Pharaoh still
[1:30:35] didn't have respect for him
[1:30:45] Moses
[1:30:48] would walk out
[1:30:55] any brother Brandon I'm skipping through
[1:30:57] a lot of things but brother Brown would
[1:30:58] go just go listen to this sermon it's
[1:31:00] incredible there's so many things in
[1:31:02] here
[1:31:05] it'll do you a
[1:31:07] it'll give you a checkup
[1:31:12] he says strange
[1:31:15] he says these people walked out rejoiced
[1:31:16] and shouted and carrying on
[1:31:19] first little trial come
[1:31:22] and they've forgot to respect the gift
[1:31:25] of God
[1:31:27] and they begin to say things he said
[1:31:30] that's how it is that's where we make
[1:31:31] our mistake little sickness Strikers a
[1:31:33] little disaster and we go to Falling
[1:31:35] Away
[1:31:37] young convert somebody make fun of them
[1:31:39] say well you ain't nothing but a Holy
[1:31:40] Roller well I hate be called be caught
[1:31:42] and being called a Holy Roller and out
[1:31:44] they'll go amen that is the time to
[1:31:47] respect what God has said and stand
[1:31:52] foreign
[1:31:53] I've already done these Miracles God's
[1:31:56] given you them or now you're afraid of
[1:31:58] the sea are you afraid to believe and he
[1:32:00] took the rod and began to speak to it
[1:32:02] and he began to move and then God would
[1:32:05] go from there and he would make the
[1:32:06] bitters water sweet he would he would do
[1:32:08] all kinds of things feed him rain out of
[1:32:10] bread out of heaven and quails and all
[1:32:13] kinds of things whatever Rock
[1:32:16] and they would complain and they would
[1:32:17] murmur and they would make fun and even
[1:32:19] his own sister
[1:32:21] see Moses who do you think you are you
[1:32:24] think you're a God Among Us
[1:32:26] she fell to respect she thought it was
[1:32:29] just her brother
[1:32:30] but it was God
[1:32:33] and God struck her with leprosy
[1:32:36] and Moses actually had to go in the
[1:32:38] breach for her for God to save her life
[1:32:41] and God would cleanse her we know the
[1:32:42] story and we go on down and Moses would
[1:32:45] pray for her and God would give we can
[1:32:47] go to Jezebel who who Elijah was sent to
[1:32:49] be her pastor but she didn't have
[1:32:51] respect for him
[1:32:53] she didn't have respect for what he said
[1:32:55] she thought well that's just oh Elijah
[1:32:57] he's crazy as a betsy bug run out to the
[1:32:59] desert we don't hear from him then he
[1:33:00] comes running here declaring the
[1:33:02] judgments of God then he runs away again
[1:33:04] that can't be nobody but that can't be
[1:33:06] God
[1:33:09] oh yeah he'd ball her out tell her of
[1:33:11] her sins yet he was her pastor and she
[1:33:13] wouldn't receive it at all she
[1:33:15] disrespected him she hated him for what
[1:33:18] he had said she disrespected the message
[1:33:21] that Elijah was preaching God demands
[1:33:23] respect we have to discern the Lord's
[1:33:26] body
[1:33:31] and when she respected God's Prophet she
[1:33:34] disrespected God
[1:33:37] why
[1:33:38] his visions and everything were perfect
[1:33:40] before God
[1:33:42] but it condemned them for what they were
[1:33:45] doing
[1:33:50] well we can find others in that day
[1:33:58] before we get there I got one more
[1:34:04] you know respect for the house of God
[1:34:07] starts at home
[1:34:11] it starts with father and mother
[1:34:13] and it starts
[1:34:15] by allowing
[1:34:18] you know it really it even starts even
[1:34:20] in some ways of allowing your pastor to
[1:34:22] be a man
[1:34:24] and allowing preachers to be men and
[1:34:26] allowing them yeah they're going to make
[1:34:28] mistakes
[1:34:29] but that ain't what we got to talk about
[1:34:30] around our mashed potatoes and chicken
[1:34:34] they're going to say things we don't
[1:34:35] like but that ain't got about got to be
[1:34:37] what we discuss around our table we can
[1:34:40] read about it brother Brown talks about
[1:34:41] the children that the Elisha called out
[1:34:43] the she Bears upon them he said why did
[1:34:46] that happen why were they disrespectful
[1:34:48] toward the prophet of God he said
[1:34:50] because their mom and dad sat around the
[1:34:52] table and began to disqualify everything
[1:34:55] the prophet said
[1:34:57] and began to Mock and make fun and make
[1:35:00] light of it and say well I can't believe
[1:35:02] you would say that I can't believe he
[1:35:03] would do that and it caused their death
[1:35:07] do you realize sometimes when you sit
[1:35:09] there and you begin to say well this
[1:35:11] brother over here brother Joe brother
[1:35:12] Timothy brother and you begin to pick
[1:35:14] out their faults and we got them
[1:35:17] we all got them but the Bible said judge
[1:35:21] yourself
[1:35:22] lest ye be judged
[1:35:27] he said well what's that Jesus said
[1:35:29] about people walking around wanting to
[1:35:31] pick out a a was a splinter in
[1:35:33] somebody's finger meanwhile they're
[1:35:35] walking around with a big old beam in
[1:35:36] their eye
[1:35:40] we all got we all make mistakes
[1:35:43] we're going to say things you don't like
[1:35:45] we're going to step on your toes we're
[1:35:48] going to step on our toes
[1:35:50] all the time
[1:35:52] that is I've sat back there it's like
[1:35:54] Lord why did you wear my toes out so bad
[1:35:59] it hurts sometimes but it's for our good
[1:36:04] God is trying to mold it's trying to
[1:36:06] make us trying to make us aware of where
[1:36:09] we're at
[1:36:11] and if we're not careful we'll we'll
[1:36:13] just tear it all down and make it
[1:36:15] nothing but carnal until we're throwing
[1:36:17] our kids to the Bears
[1:36:20] preacher can say something before they
[1:36:22] even get out the door you don't text to
[1:36:24] them and say well I can't believe he
[1:36:26] said that why because you're throwing
[1:36:28] why why because you don't have respect
[1:36:31] and you're throwing them to the Bears
[1:36:36] God is the discerner
[1:36:43] I don't even know if somebody's actually
[1:36:44] done that
[1:36:46] but God does
[1:36:51] we wonder why kids are having issues
[1:36:54] well they can't ever raise up
[1:36:56] why they can't ever rise above rise
[1:36:59] above certain things because they see
[1:37:01] their daddy and their mama hadn't done
[1:37:02] it
[1:37:04] I'm being serial tonight
[1:37:08] God wants us to have respects
[1:37:13] there's a few kids that are crying out
[1:37:15] for their mom and dad to really release
[1:37:17] themselves and worship God they want to
[1:37:20] see that
[1:37:21] they want to see that passion they want
[1:37:23] to see that desire they want to see that
[1:37:25] auction of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:35] they've disrespected the prophet
[1:37:37] and thereby they throwed their kids to
[1:37:39] the Bears
[1:37:44] so many things in here
[1:37:47] I want to get somewhere
[1:37:49] but we find some people who did respect
[1:37:51] it
[1:37:52] finally shooting my woman
[1:37:58] she was from shoonam but she believed
[1:38:01] God
[1:38:02] and she seen this man pass through town
[1:38:04] and heard him speak she's seen the signs
[1:38:07] that he's done it's told in history
[1:38:10] said I said I don't know if it was true
[1:38:12] but he said no but it's one it's told in
[1:38:15] history one day a bunch of wild dogs are
[1:38:17] trying to catch a little girl he said
[1:38:18] this ain't scripture it's just a story I
[1:38:20] read and said the shunivite woman was
[1:38:22] standing in the corner she saw these
[1:38:23] dogs was going to kill this little girl
[1:38:25] and this holy man was passing to the
[1:38:27] town and he raised his staff up to God
[1:38:29] and cried up for Mercy to them little
[1:38:31] children like that and the dogs turned
[1:38:33] and went away from them
[1:38:35] wow
[1:38:37] we have children being ate by bears and
[1:38:40] children being dogs moving away from
[1:38:43] them
[1:38:47] it's our attitudes
[1:38:49] it's our attitudes toward the word of
[1:38:51] God
[1:38:55] he said whether it was so or not sounds
[1:38:57] like it could be I don't know but anyhow
[1:38:59] this woman when the Bible says she
[1:39:01] perceived that this was a prophet a holy
[1:39:03] man she perceived something that
[1:39:04] happened she seen what he was she
[1:39:06] perceived it and she had respect instead
[1:39:09] of disrespecting him like Jezebel did
[1:39:11] she respect him she deserved this is the
[1:39:13] Lord's body and she said to her husband
[1:39:16] we are well able to do this I pray thee
[1:39:18] let's build him a little house out here
[1:39:20] somewhere let's give him a little place
[1:39:22] for he's weary I watched him he's
[1:39:24] getting old I've noticed his old gray
[1:39:26] hair is hanging down little old staff
[1:39:28] and his skinny arms he needs a place of
[1:39:30] rest and he come walking along packing
[1:39:32] that little Cruise of oil inside and a
[1:39:34] piece of sheepskin and the hot sun his
[1:39:36] body looks scorched and red and she said
[1:39:38] I pray that he let's make a little
[1:39:40] station for him to stop right here
[1:39:43] God is there any shooting my women in
[1:39:45] the building tonight and say listen I
[1:39:48] know God is passing through and I want
[1:39:50] to make a little room in my house
[1:39:52] I want to have respect for him that when
[1:39:55] he comes with love or he comes with a
[1:39:57] correction or he comes with however he
[1:40:00] wants to come I want to have a place
[1:40:01] that he can rest at and be a peace out
[1:40:05] in my house
[1:40:14] a man said yeah I've watched him he's of
[1:40:17] God he called a contractor spent a lot
[1:40:21] of money
[1:40:22] built him a place of rest fixed them up
[1:40:24] a place to wash his feet
[1:40:26] to eat a little food
[1:40:28] Prophet Bible came by of course that
[1:40:30] blessed his soul to see something like
[1:40:32] that had been done for him
[1:40:33] he said hey he's like go call her and
[1:40:36] ask her what I could do for her
[1:40:38] can I speak to the king or to the chief
[1:40:40] captain
[1:40:42] she said I dwell among my people and
[1:40:45] there's nothing I have need of
[1:40:48] but gays I said she has no children and
[1:40:51] her husband is well stricken in age he's
[1:40:53] old and they have no children and I
[1:40:55] imagine Elijah laying there on this
[1:40:57] little bed that she had blessed him by
[1:40:59] making had his feet all washed his beard
[1:41:01] was washed out just relax and all of a
[1:41:03] sudden a vision came
[1:41:06] foreign
[1:41:08] go call her and tell her to stand there
[1:41:11] before me call her why because she had
[1:41:15] respect unto God go tell her to come
[1:41:17] here and she stood in the door and he
[1:41:19] said thus saith the Lord about this time
[1:41:22] next year you'll bear a baby about this
[1:41:24] time next year she had the baby
[1:41:28] why because of respect to God and her
[1:41:32] her emotions that she she released was
[1:41:35] respect
[1:41:37] I gotta have a place where he could have
[1:41:40] a place of peace
[1:41:42] I want my home to be a place he can
[1:41:45] dwell in
[1:41:50] I want it to be a place
[1:41:53] that the healing angel can come by
[1:41:58] and he can walk through my door I want
[1:42:00] him here it open I want him here at
[1:42:02] Creek he'll just walk through my door
[1:42:04] but all of a sudden I'll feel that cool
[1:42:06] sweep reach over me and it'll be over
[1:42:08] with
[1:42:10] why because I had respect unto his word
[1:42:14] I believe what he said
[1:42:18] didn't discount it to be just a human
[1:42:20] thing a carnal impersonations no and we
[1:42:24] know the story the son would die later
[1:42:27] but that didn't change her respect
[1:42:30] can't believe God gave me this and now
[1:42:32] it's gone
[1:42:33] can't believe it when we're going to
[1:42:36] have something that lasts
[1:42:40] no no
[1:42:42] she said give me a Mew I got to go find
[1:42:44] that prophet
[1:42:46] and she goes riding to him and I want
[1:42:48] you to see the respect that she had for
[1:42:50] him she didn't she fell down she began
[1:42:53] to worship but what happened he asked
[1:42:55] her said is it well with thee is it well
[1:42:57] with your home and she said all is well
[1:43:04] that's the respect she had for that man
[1:43:07] of God because she knew of that man of
[1:43:10] God could come to where she had that
[1:43:12] need it would be over with
[1:43:16] and if we can have that much respect
[1:43:18] towards the word of God
[1:43:20] that when he speaks he's going to do
[1:43:22] what he said he would do it might take a
[1:43:24] year it might take 10 years I don't know
[1:43:26] how long it's going to take but God said
[1:43:28] it
[1:43:29] and I've got enough respect for him to
[1:43:32] believe what he said
[1:43:34] how dare me be disrespectful and deny
[1:43:37] that it won't happen and deny it's not
[1:43:39] possible I know it will happen because
[1:43:42] he said it would happen
[1:43:47] all is well
[1:43:50] yeah
[1:43:51] we could look at Martha had respect my
[1:43:53] go let's go listen to the sermon it's
[1:43:56] amazing
[1:43:57] but we know

[1:44:27] thereby showing respect for him he is
