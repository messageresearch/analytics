[36:56] amen i believe there's something to that
[36:59] amen god is light
[37:02] amen
[37:04] i'd like to speak to you on attracted to
[37:06] the light john chapter 1 and verse 1 in
[37:09] the beginning
[37:10] was the word and the word was with god
[37:12] and the word was god and the same was in
[37:15] the beginning with god and all things
[37:17] were made by him and without him was not
[37:20] anything made that was made
[37:23] and in him was life
[37:25] and the life was the light of men
[37:28] and the light shineth in darkness and
[37:30] the darkness
[37:31] comprehendeth it not
[37:33] there was a man sent from god whose name
[37:35] was john the same came for a witness
[37:38] to bear witness of the light that all
[37:40] men
[37:41] through him might believe
[37:43] now he was not that light but was sent
[37:46] to bear witness of that light
[37:48] that was the true light which lighteth
[37:50] every man that cometh into the world
[37:54] he was in the world and the world was
[37:56] made by him
[37:57] and the world knew him not he came into
[38:00] his own and his own received him not but
[38:03] as many as received him
[38:05] to them gave he power to become the sons
[38:08] of god
[38:09] even to them that believe on his name
[38:12] amen god bless you this
[38:14] evening you can be seated
[38:21] amen he was
[38:23] that true light
[38:25] i love how the scripture says which
[38:27] lighteth every man that cometh into the
[38:30] world
[38:31] now whether they acknowledge that light
[38:33] or not it does not matter they was their
[38:36] life has been touched by the light
[38:39] amen and you know we finally of course
[38:41] when he came 2 000 years ago as john
[38:43] would say he came to the world and the
[38:45] world that was made made for by him and
[38:48] for him and through him but the world
[38:51] knew him not
[38:52] and he even came to his own his own
[38:54] people that he had called and called out
[38:56] to be a elect people a separated people
[39:00] we know they did not receive him but
[39:03] those who did receive them he gave them
[39:05] power to became become that same light
[39:09] amen you know in the book of john
[39:11] there's many references to light
[39:14] jesus being the light of the world jesus
[39:16] being lifted up as a light you know as a
[39:18] lighthouse that would give guidance
[39:21] through treacherous waters to warn of
[39:23] dangerous places but also as a light to
[39:26] attract the attention of the believer
[39:29] now we can read and i'm going to go
[39:31] through these really quickly but in john
[39:33] 3 14 he said moses was lifted up in this
[39:36] as a serpent under the wilderness even
[39:38] so much
[39:39] the son of man be lifted up that
[39:42] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[39:44] perish but have eternal life for god so
[39:47] loved the world that he gave his only
[39:49] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[39:52] him should not perish but have
[39:54] everlasting life for god sent not his
[39:57] son into the world to condemn the world
[39:59] but that the world through him might be
[40:01] saved and he that believeth on him is
[40:04] not condemned but he that believeth not
[40:06] is condemned already because he's not
[40:08] believed in the name of the only
[40:09] begotten son of god and this is the
[40:12] condemnation that the light is coming to
[40:15] the world but men love darkness rather
[40:18] than light now they saw the light they
[40:20] seen what the light done but they loved
[40:22] the darkness better than the light
[40:24] because their deeds were evil now if you
[40:27] see someone who likes darkness more than
[40:29] light you know there's something wrong
[40:31] with them there's something that they're
[40:32] trying to hide because they know if they
[40:34] come into the light that light will
[40:36] reveal what's on the inside or what
[40:38] their their deeds that they're doing he
[40:40] said for everyone that doeth evil hateth
[40:43] the light neither come into the light
[40:45] lest his deeds should be reproved but he
[40:47] that doeth truth cometh to the light
[40:50] that his deeds may be made manifest that
[40:53] they are wrought in god
[40:56] also in john 8 verse 12 jesus spake
[40:58] again of them saying i am the light of
[41:01] the world and he that followeth me shall
[41:03] not walk in darkness but shall have the
[41:06] light of life in john chapter 9 and
[41:09] verse 1 as we had even speak about last
[41:11] wednesday the blind man said jesus
[41:13] passed by and he saw a man that was
[41:15] blind from his birth and his disciples
[41:17] asked him saying master master who did
[41:20] sin this man or his parents that he was
[41:22] born blind and jesus said neither hath
[41:25] this man sin nor his parents but that
[41:28] the work of god should be made manifest
[41:30] in him and he said i must work the works
[41:33] of him that sent me while it is day the
[41:36] night cometh when no man can work but as
[41:38] long as i am in the world i am the light
[41:42] of the world and so he was saying this
[41:44] man was put in this place that the light
[41:46] of god could shine upon him and show
[41:49] amen who he really is and john chapter
[41:52] 12 and verse 44 it says jesus christ and
[41:55] he said he that believeth on me
[41:57] believeth believeth not on me amen but
[42:00] on him that sent me and he that seeth me
[42:02] seeth him that sent me i am come i am i
[42:06] am coming light unto the world and
[42:08] whosoever believeth on me should not
[42:11] abide in darkness and so we know amen
[42:14] that in there may be dark and we talked
[42:16] about the things that around us and and
[42:18] we see it getting every day it's just
[42:20] getting darker and darker but in this in
[42:22] the darkness that light can really shine
[42:25] it's in the darkness that light actually
[42:27] you know begins to really show what it
[42:29] is and light you know is it attracted
[42:31] it's a it's a drawing power amen as we
[42:34] said in darkness it's more it's more
[42:36] effective the more the darker it is the
[42:38] more effective light can be but a light
[42:41] can't be hid it has to be lifted up and
[42:44] this is why jesus would say
[42:46] i'm to be lifted up and when i'm lifted
[42:48] up i'll draw all men unto me i'll
[42:51] attract men amen unto me but i have to
[42:54] be lifted up now we know what he was
[42:55] speaking about as a brass serpent was
[42:58] lifted up amen between heavens and earth
[43:00] as a as a place to where men could look
[43:03] they had been bitten by serpents and and
[43:05] were dying from a serpent's bite they
[43:07] could look at that and be healed and he
[43:09] said i'm gonna have to be as a light be
[43:11] lifted up where men can look at me and
[43:14] they can be healed of that serpent's
[43:16] bite and you know we know that this
[43:18] light had to be lifted up so it could
[43:20] draw now you know you don't put a light
[43:22] you know in a hole somewhere in your
[43:24] front yard or under a bush somewhere you
[43:27] put it to where it'll draw or it
[43:29] attracts it'll it'll bring something to
[43:32] your home or you know whatever you're
[43:33] trying to do and we know but we know
[43:36] that this light it'll not only attract
[43:38] faults but it'll also attract true or
[43:40] it'll not only attract the true it'll
[43:43] also attract the faults and that's
[43:45] because it's the same power the same sun
[43:47] that draws the wheat out of the ground
[43:49] it also draws the terror out of the
[43:52] graph amen it's the light that is
[43:54] drawing them it's the light that is
[43:56] pulling them and it's the same light
[43:57] that draws the real draws of faults and
[44:00] you know but but god would use light
[44:02] many times through the scripture and as
[44:04] a pillar of fire or as an angel of light
[44:07] or or something that would attract men's
[44:09] attention he would do this to moses as
[44:11] moses was out on the backside of a
[44:13] desert and we know his story and he
[44:15] would turn and he was attracted you know
[44:18] by a bush that burned now it had to be
[44:20] in a place where god knew moses would
[44:22] see it so therefore he wouldn't put it
[44:24] behind a rock he wouldn't put it
[44:25] somewhere you know what good would it do
[44:27] to just have a light somewhere burning
[44:29] but it had to be in a place lifted up to
[44:32] where moses it would attract moses
[44:34] attention now we find out that this was
[44:36] the angel of god or the angel of the
[44:38] lord that was in the bush and and he
[44:41] began to speak to moses now you know
[44:43] moses had been in a bitter failure he'd
[44:45] tried to deliver the children of israel
[44:47] he had tried to do amen that 40 years
[44:50] before that and became a failure and
[44:52] brother adam said he lost all vision of
[44:54] victory he had lost all vision of
[44:57] freedom for the people that was enslaved
[44:59] by egypt and you know he said i wonder
[45:01] sometimes you know if the church of god
[45:04] knowing that god has promised to deliver
[45:06] the church from its sin or or from its
[45:08] sickness and and make us a people
[45:11] that the earth will hunger and thirst to
[45:14] be like you know but in our own he said
[45:16] our own human efforts and our home own
[45:18] human theologies and our fine churches
[45:21] and things and we tried to build and
[45:23] present to people a god of many years
[45:26] ago and we find out that that all failed
[45:29] he said but god has a real light that
[45:32] still shines
[45:33] this is still an attractant still
[45:35] something a drawing power amen i believe
[45:38] that it's not just our building that's a
[45:40] drawing power we got a beautiful
[45:41] building and we got a beautiful
[45:43] facilities and god's blessed us in many
[45:45] ways but that's not the true drawing
[45:48] power of the church of the living god
[45:50] amen it's not even the people that's a
[45:52] true as far as
[45:53] you know their standings of society and
[45:55] we got to have so many that's on this uh
[45:58] on in this government role or or this
[46:01] high society and they've become this
[46:03] successful that's not the true drawing
[46:05] power of the church of the living god
[46:07] what is the true drawing power of the
[46:09] church of the living god and what really
[46:11] holds the people of god is the light of
[46:14] god it's the pillar of fire that's in
[46:16] the midst of the church and and that's
[46:18] what we want in our church it's not just
[46:20] a fine building it's not just to find
[46:22] facilities and things that we've got and
[46:24] god has blessed us with but we've got to
[46:26] have the pillar of fire we have to have
[46:28] the true light of god that is pulling
[46:31] that is drawing that is calling all men
[46:34] unto me amen it's not even a ministry as
[46:36] a man can do or a man can you know it's
[46:39] not a man-made thing what i'm trying to
[46:41] say it's god anointing gifts and placing
[46:44] gifts in a body amen in the gospel the
[46:47] power of the gospel being preached and
[46:49] the light of god going out into the
[46:51] highways and the byways amen because
[46:54] there has to be a light in this time
[46:56] that we're living in because obviously
[46:58] there must be trills still true seeds of
[47:00] god out there in darkness therefore it
[47:02] has to be a lighthouse or light in this
[47:05] dark time that we're living in to draw
[47:07] to pull amen to hold to amen that people
[47:10] can come to not just because they see a
[47:12] good church but because they saw a good
[47:15] building in a beautiful place but they
[47:17] see there's a power there there's
[47:19] something on the inside of them that has
[47:21] pulsating it's not just just them it's
[47:24] not just the people it's not just the
[47:25] structure but there's something that's
[47:27] moving there's a holy ghost on the
[47:29] inside they may not be able to describe
[47:32] it but they can feel it they can they
[47:33] can see it amen and this is what pulled
[47:36] moses it wasn't a rock it wasn't just
[47:38] some beautiful mountain out there he saw
[47:41] that all of his life but there was
[47:42] something different that morning that he
[47:44] got up there was a bush that began to
[47:46] burn it was a light that attracted his
[47:49] attention and we see here you know
[47:51] brother baum talks about that he said
[47:53] but the problem is he said instead of
[47:55] the holy spirit leading the church he
[47:57] said we got off the real principles and
[48:00] the real thing god told us to do we left
[48:03] all of that and we lost our divine joy
[48:07] amen and now our vision is dulling and
[48:11] and people are not looking for the
[48:12] coming of the lord yet atomic bombs are
[48:15] hanging in hangars and and things that
[48:17] will destroy the world all at once and
[48:19] people have lost their vision of the
[48:21] lord he says he said see we must turn
[48:24] loose and let god do the things that he
[48:27] promised he would do
[48:29] hallelujah he said how can we do these
[48:32] things without the holy spirit
[48:35] you're not going to do it because you
[48:36] got to find church you're not going to
[48:38] do it because your church is full of
[48:40] people you're not going to do it because
[48:41] you got a certain man or a certain music
[48:44] or certain death you're going to do
[48:45] these things that's in the word of god
[48:47] and these promises are going to be
[48:49] fulfilled because of the holy ghost the
[48:52] spirit of god moving and attracting amen
[48:55] the people of god amen we can't do it
[48:57] without the holy ghost
[49:00] i don't even want a service without the
[49:01] holy ghost i don't want to day without
[49:04] the holy ghost and the spirit of god and
[49:06] the pull of god in our lives i want that
[49:09] to be even like tabernacles drawing amen
[49:13] as the power of god moving our remits
[49:16] hallelujah not just to get together not
[49:18] just a few times and some good music i
[49:21] want the power of god drawing us
[49:24] the holy ghost pulling us the light of
[49:27] god pulling us that is the attraction on
[49:30] the mount
[49:33] you mean it's a burning bush
[49:35] it's not what we can do in our own
[49:37] learning and our own abilities he said
[49:39] see fire brings attraction
[49:45] amen usually the holy spirit when it
[49:48] comes in the manner of fire it attracts
[49:50] the attention of people he said when
[49:52] moses turned aside considering this
[49:55] burning tree that would not burn up and
[49:57] out of him spoke a fresh vision by the
[49:59] angel
[50:01] amen you got to have the light to get a
[50:03] fresh vision
[50:04] you got to have the spirit of god to get
[50:06] a fresh vision he said watch faith begin
[50:09] to take hold all things are passed away
[50:11] but now moses has a new vision he has a
[50:14] revelation he has an experience he has
[50:17] met god he's talked to him face to face
[50:20] not only has he read about it not only
[50:22] has he got what his mama told him but
[50:24] now he has his own experience now he's
[50:26] been attracted by the light and the
[50:29] light has gave him a new vision
[50:32] oh hallelujah now that's why we see
[50:34] churches dying because the light has
[50:36] gone out
[50:38] therefore with the light going out amen
[50:41] amen the vision is dulling in and they
[50:43] don't see a god who could do things like
[50:45] he used to do it and still do them
[50:49] healings still take place and
[50:51] deliverance still take place and the
[50:53] power of god still change people
[50:56] therefore they begin to make excuses
[50:58] well mercy's over and this and that and
[51:00] the other amen what is it they've tried
[51:02] to make but instead of asking god to say
[51:05] lord we need a real birth we need a real
[51:07] uh rejuvenation of the spirit of god
[51:10] amen they begin to make an excuse why he
[51:12] ain't there
[51:14] amen
[51:16] but now not only did he have what he
[51:18] read and what he heard from his mother
[51:20] and from maybe somebody else but now he
[51:22] had a personal experience he said that's
[51:24] what the church needs tonight is to stop
[51:27] studying so much theology and get down
[51:30] to an altar and pray until a personal
[51:32] experience burns into your heart and it
[51:35] burns out all the dullness and gives you
[51:37] a new vision
[51:39] hallelujah let's not he said let's take
[51:42] the other fella again another place
[51:44] moses on the backside of a desert just
[51:46] as full of doctrine as he could be
[51:50] he knew all the ins and outs he could
[51:52] even teach the egyptians some of the
[51:54] smartest people of that day but one day
[51:57] he saw something in a fire
[52:00] and it attracted him and that's what we
[52:02] need today as a church
[52:04] on fire to attract
[52:06] [Applause]
[52:08] amen not a dead church
[52:10] with cold creeds and dogmas and and
[52:13] living on yesterday 50 years ago fire we
[52:16] need a fresh fire the same fire that
[52:19] fell on the day of pentecost can fall in
[52:21] this day and hour that we live in and
[52:23] give you a new vision
[52:25] [Music]
[52:26] and you can see a god of not just
[52:28] history but a god of today and when the
[52:31] fresh holy spirit falls upon your life
[52:34] it'll give you a new vision
[52:36] and all the coldness and all the
[52:38] dullness and all the things that were in
[52:41] the past now you can see now a true
[52:43] living god
[52:45] because of the light
[52:47] amen
[52:49] he said see
[52:50] it's a church on fire that'll attract
[52:53] some of these moses
[52:58] amen some of these moses
[53:00] and attract some of these sinners it
[53:03] takes a fire to give an attraction
[53:06] you know what attract your attention
[53:08] right quick is somebody come in that
[53:10] door and start hauling fire
[53:14] amen everybody be up and about and
[53:16] wondering what's going on amen even
[53:18] those that are sleeping and wake up
[53:20] amen why because they heard one word
[53:23] fire
[53:25] one fire he said that's what we got to
[53:27] have
[53:28] is the fire of the holy ghost
[53:32] it'll attract the believer to see
[53:34] something
[53:36] hallelujah amen amen he said i remember
[53:39] an old friend of mine named ben
[53:41] pemberman he said he's quite a fellow
[53:43] over in saint louis he had a tent
[53:45] meeting going down there and nobody
[53:46] would come to it so he took off running
[53:48] down the street and he's beginning to
[53:50] scream fire fire fire
[53:53] and running pointing down towards where
[53:55] his tent was and up the street he went
[53:57] throwing his head up as high as he could
[53:58] and screaming acting like a lunatic and
[54:01] had a tent meeting up there everybody
[54:02] began to run behind and wonder what's
[54:04] going on running through the fire
[54:07] he said he got all them people in the
[54:08] tent he said well while you're here let
[54:10] me preach to you about some fire some
[54:12] holy ghost and fire
[54:14] and he started preaching just as hard as
[54:16] he could do he said the best thing
[54:19] that'll attract a wayward man is the
[54:21] holy ghost in fire that's the way god
[54:24] did it before and that's the way god
[54:26] does it now
[54:27] [Applause]
[54:29] amen so instead of preachers hollering
[54:31] theology and theology and theology and
[54:34] mechanics and mechanics and some some of
[54:36] you start hollering fire
[54:39] fire we need the holy ghost and fire we
[54:42] need the power of god back in our
[54:44] churches we need to move without sin
[54:46] moving out unbelief we need the days of
[54:48] ananias and fire
[54:52] come on somebody ain't gonna burn out
[54:54] all the coldness and the and the amen if
[54:57] we get some preachers hollering that a
[54:59] little bit it'll change some attitude
[55:06] didn't think he could do it he didn't
[55:07] try it on his own with his doctrinal
[55:09] standpoints
[55:10] and it didn't work
[55:12] but he got to the fire
[55:14] and the fire said take your shoes off
[55:17] i know you're prince in egypt but you're
[55:20] nothing in my sight gets off your shoes
[55:24] amen you're on holy ground
[55:27] get rid of all that stuff you got in
[55:29] here oh my and he heard a sound
[55:32] oh my that's what happens when you get
[55:34] in the fire
[55:35] when you come face to face with this
[55:36] holy fire of god amen it'll kick off the
[55:39] wrong shoes it'll kick off the wrong
[55:41] clothes
[55:43] it'll replace them but it'll kick off
[55:44] the wrong clothes it'll kick off the
[55:46] makeup it'll kick up all the way because
[55:49] you might be somebody to some society
[55:51] but with god you're nothing but a piece
[55:53] of dirt
[55:56] but he wants to put some real life on
[55:57] the inside of you
[55:59] and quicken that seed on the inside of
[56:01] you but it takes fire
[56:04] amen i preached on this not too long ago
[56:06] about being born in the fire of those
[56:08] big trees over in california it puts off
[56:10] those seeds and they fall into the
[56:12] ground amen but it takes a fire to
[56:15] actually open up that seed to where this
[56:17] life can come out of it
[56:19] oh now we know what's wrong with a lot
[56:21] of churches they ain't got their
[56:23] services hot enough they ain't got the
[56:25] power of god moving they don't question
[56:27] a bunch of man-made theologies and
[56:29] creeds and dogmas and worried about
[56:30] somebody else's church and worried about
[56:32] what's going on over there what you need
[56:34] to do is worry about what's happening in
[56:36] your own church
[56:38] and say god i want the fire of god to
[56:40] come in my life to come in my church
[56:43] that seeds can open up and bring forth
[56:45] life
[56:48] it takes fire
[56:50] amen
[56:52] moses
[56:53] didn't know what he didn't know about
[56:55] all these other voices no more he
[56:57] doesn't heard the real voice
[56:59] and the voice said i've heard the cry of
[57:00] my people i've seen their tasks their
[57:03] problems and their situation the
[57:04] taskmasters i remember my promise and my
[57:07] covenant
[57:10] now that was something scriptural
[57:13] and he says he said see
[57:15] he says a real a scholar may hear about
[57:18] there's no such a divine healing and a
[57:20] whole bunch of work up
[57:22] but to a real believer
[57:24] they won't listen to that they'll listen
[57:26] to jesus christ the same yesterday today
[57:29] and forever they'll listen i'm the lord
[57:31] that heals all thy diseases but moses he
[57:34] he now is in the presence of the fire
[57:36] and all these other voices the voices of
[57:38] his past the voices of his past failures
[57:41] the voices of egypt was now all dead and
[57:44] now he could hear the voice of god
[57:46] and the voice of god was speaking it was
[57:49] a pillar of fire it attracted his
[57:50] tension he said this great theologian he
[57:53] had run with all of his theological
[57:55] training and all of his understanding
[57:57] from his mother
[58:02] from his mother
[58:03] but now the word itself came to him and
[58:06] although his mother had thoroughly
[58:08] instructed him what to do and what he
[58:10] would do and what god had raised him all
[58:12] this knowledge as good as it is it is
[58:15] good but yet it has to be set off
[58:18] now follow me just a minute it has to be
[58:20] set off that knowledge is just only
[58:23] mechanics
[58:26] mechanics ain't what runs an automobile
[58:29] the dynamics is what runs it
[58:32] this is a quote now mechanics don't run
[58:34] the church
[58:37] hello somebody mechanics don't run the
[58:40] church it's the dynamics
[58:43] it's the holy ghost that gets into the
[58:45] word it's not a seminary that teaches
[58:47] you all the theology and all the greek
[58:49] interpretation but it's the dynamics of
[58:52] the holy ghost in there to set you a
[58:54] fire
[58:56] to bring to pass the word of god and
[58:58] make it live exactly what it was
[59:00] supposed to do in your hour
[59:04] not just the mechanics but the dynamics
[59:07] it takes both the word and the spirit
[59:09] they're the one that gives a life but
[59:11] god has promised for the hour looking
[59:14] for we need to start looking for it to
[59:16] be fulfilled you must look at him you
[59:19] must look to the lie there must be the
[59:21] word begin to illuminate you not just an
[59:24] illuminate your mind
[59:26] that's what people love they love their
[59:28] minds illuminated well i got more to i
[59:31] know more today than what i know but it
[59:33] ain't known by the mind
[59:35] it's known by the revelation in the
[59:37] heart
[59:38] because your mind will lie to you
[59:41] you might you know you you'll have mind
[59:43] battles you say well brother timothy i
[59:44] thought i had the holy ghost and i still
[59:46] got mine battled well yeah you're going
[59:47] to have them because you still got a
[59:49] mind
[59:51] you still got the human elements you
[59:53] still got things that are there and
[59:55] you're as much as your soul is sealed by
[59:57] the until the day of your redemption
[59:59] your mind it'll still wander it'll still
[1:00:02] have but the problem the difference is
[1:00:04] now there's a control tower on the
[1:00:06] inside and it sees a thought that comes
[1:00:08] in and it says nope i'm gonna reject
[1:00:10] that thought and you might have to
[1:00:12] reject that thought a hundred times a
[1:00:14] day for a whole month and it's
[1:00:15] tormenting and coming and coming and
[1:00:17] coming but there's something on the
[1:00:18] inside of you that's pushing it out
[1:00:21] pushing it out that's not just mechanics
[1:00:23] that's dynamics that's the dynamics of
[1:00:26] the holy ghost amen it'll push out those
[1:00:29] say and push out those thoughts you're
[1:00:31] going to have them
[1:00:35] lord i i don't even want to put up here
[1:00:37] today our thoughts as ministers
[1:00:40] but i wouldn't want
[1:00:42] we all got thoughts
[1:00:45] listen
[1:00:46] just be honest with you you have
[1:00:48] something that goes on in your life
[1:00:50] somebody does you wrong your first
[1:00:52] thought is not to hug their neck
[1:00:55] is not to shake their hand
[1:00:57] it's not to even give them a smile
[1:01:00] that's not your first thoughts
[1:01:04] there'll be thoughts that wells up in
[1:01:05] you and you want to wear them out
[1:01:09] you want to take uh something and just
[1:01:11] beat the tar out of them because they
[1:01:13] did you wrong
[1:01:14] but
[1:01:15] something's different
[1:01:16] maybe the old man would have done that
[1:01:20] you got you got something you to beat
[1:01:21] the tar out of somebody because of what
[1:01:23] and they did wrong they did wrong they
[1:01:25] did wrong it doesn't change if they did
[1:01:27] wrong they did wrong but what changes is
[1:01:30] what the response is
[1:01:31] it might come into your mind but there's
[1:01:33] a control tower says no that's not what
[1:01:35] you do anymore
[1:01:37] amen get on your knees and pray for them
[1:01:39] and and i'll take care of it
[1:01:42] amen but you have to reject those
[1:01:44] thoughts all the time amen see this this
[1:01:47] is what moses was he had all kinds of
[1:01:49] thoughts don't you think he had enough
[1:01:51] time to think about all of his failures
[1:01:53] and all of his mistakes and all of his
[1:01:55] problems and all those things and then
[1:01:58] he meets the fire of god and god comes
[1:02:00] down and reveals himself in a personal
[1:02:02] way and he still walked away and he
[1:02:04] still had thoughts he still had thoughts
[1:02:07] of failure no doubt thoughts of what am
[1:02:09] i doing but something on this i know i
[1:02:12] meant something real
[1:02:13] this couldn't have been a man-made thing
[1:02:16] i didn't do this on my own i met
[1:02:18] somebody and he told me go down there
[1:02:21] and tell pharaoh let my people go
[1:02:24] that's the difference in your heart now
[1:02:26] when you meet those things you begin to
[1:02:28] realize no i met somebody and when i met
[1:02:31] somebody he changed me on the inside and
[1:02:35] i'm going to go down there with the word
[1:02:36] of card and i'm going to speak to that
[1:02:38] thing and say let my people go
[1:02:42] this is where moses was at
[1:02:46] attracted by the light
[1:02:50] he said see
[1:02:51] the day that god had promised these
[1:02:53] things we're now enjoying these things
[1:02:54] we're seeing the world is laughing at
[1:02:57] this great momentous power the holy
[1:02:59] spirit that can change a sinner's heart
[1:03:01] they can give a lukewarm church member
[1:03:03] and take him and give a testimony and
[1:03:05] set a church of fire from where he came
[1:03:07] from out it's the dynamics that got into
[1:03:10] the word it's the light that shine it
[1:03:12] was the light that attracted
[1:03:15] you know it's paul that was attractive
[1:03:17] or actually his name was saul at the
[1:03:18] time but he was attracted by light and i
[1:03:20] just want to take his testimony for a
[1:03:22] minute acts chapter 26 and 13 he says at
[1:03:25] midday o king i saw in the way a light
[1:03:27] from heaven and above the brightness of
[1:03:30] the sun
[1:03:31] shining around about in other words it
[1:03:33] was brighter than the sun yes
[1:03:36] it blind it was so bright it actually
[1:03:38] blinded him
[1:03:40] so it was something something to shine
[1:03:42] and round about me and them that journey
[1:03:44] with me and when we were all falling to
[1:03:47] the earth i heard a voice speaking unto
[1:03:49] me saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul
[1:03:52] why persecutest thou me it is hard for
[1:03:55] thee to kick against the pricks and i
[1:03:57] said who art thou lord he said i am
[1:03:59] jesus whom thou persecuted
[1:04:02] jesus
[1:04:03] here he thought he was doing the lord's
[1:04:05] work here he thought he was taking the
[1:04:07] light and he was he was putting to death
[1:04:09] these heretics and he was shining light
[1:04:12] but god was coming to show him the
[1:04:13] greater light
[1:04:15] the greater light had come and he he
[1:04:17] attracted him by light
[1:04:19] pulling him off his high horse
[1:04:22] pulled him off of his position and who
[1:04:24] he thought he was i i am the you know
[1:04:27] i'm the great saul i'm the great man of
[1:04:29] god i've been commissioned to go down
[1:04:31] here and put these people in prison i've
[1:04:33] been commissioned to do this why what is
[1:04:35] that pow off the horse that comes and he
[1:04:37] laid on the ground and he's saying lord
[1:04:40] who are you and he says i'm jesus
[1:04:42] whom not persecuteth and a voice begins
[1:04:45] to speak speak to him he said but rise
[1:04:48] stand upon your feet for i have appeared
[1:04:51] unto thee for this purpose to make them
[1:04:53] minister and a witness both of these
[1:04:55] things which i have seen and of those
[1:04:57] things in which i will appear unto thee
[1:04:59] delivering thee from the people and from
[1:05:02] the gentiles unto whom now i send thee
[1:05:05] to open their eyes oh hallelujah and to
[1:05:08] turn them from darkness to light and
[1:05:11] from the power of satan unto god that
[1:05:13] they may receive forgiveness of sin and
[1:05:15] inheritance among them which are
[1:05:17] sanctified by faith that is in me
[1:05:20] hallelujah i'm thankful to be one of
[1:05:22] those amen who was turned from darkness
[1:05:24] into life from the power of satan unto
[1:05:27] god but god had to knock him off his
[1:05:29] high horse
[1:05:31] who he thought he was who he thought you
[1:05:33] know he's a lot different than moses
[1:05:34] moses was the opposite he was out there
[1:05:36] hiding here's saul the other direction
[1:05:39] but god still attracted him by light the
[1:05:42] gospel light is always the attraction of
[1:05:44] a true believer
[1:05:46] it's what attracted you to church
[1:05:47] tonight
[1:05:50] a light
[1:05:51] amen the gospel light
[1:05:54] is what brings you to church on a
[1:05:56] wednesday night or sunday morning or or
[1:05:58] special meetings or or different places
[1:06:00] you want to go and different different
[1:06:02] services
[1:06:03] brother and we'll talk about this he
[1:06:05] says he talks about the light begin to
[1:06:07] dim and people's interests and things he
[1:06:09] said where is the interest of the nation
[1:06:11] in the day for the salvation of the lord
[1:06:13] jesus christ
[1:06:15] for the light
[1:06:16] just some few loving will come anymore
[1:06:21] just some few loving
[1:06:23] others it's too hot to sit in a building
[1:06:25] like this in the afternoon for an hour
[1:06:27] and listen to a gospel sermon
[1:06:29] but they're willing to watch a
[1:06:30] television or a movie picture
[1:06:33] something like that even if it's right
[1:06:34] out in the bowling sun or a hot race of
[1:06:37] some sort where your treasure is that's
[1:06:39] where your heart is he says i'm so
[1:06:41] thankful that there's some that really
[1:06:43] love the lord jesus
[1:06:45] and will come out on a hot day or any
[1:06:47] day to listen to the gospel
[1:06:51] he said because in my opinion the gospel
[1:06:54] never loses its attraction to the
[1:06:57] believer
[1:06:59] hallelujah you say well i've been going
[1:07:01] 20 years it never loses its attraction
[1:07:04] it never loses its drawing power you
[1:07:07] might be 20 years 40 years or down along
[1:07:09] the journey you ought to be more in love
[1:07:11] than god than you ever was you ought to
[1:07:14] be more on fire for god than you ever
[1:07:16] was
[1:07:18] listen if you have felt yourself dimming
[1:07:20] down i encourage you god by the power of
[1:07:23] god tonight get another log
[1:07:25] get another promise put it on that fire
[1:07:27] it might not be nothing but a spark
[1:07:29] right now but if you'll put another log
[1:07:31] on it another promise of god on it and
[1:07:33] begin to let the winds of the holy ghost
[1:07:35] begin to blow it'll burst up in a flame
[1:07:38] again and it'll set your family on fire
[1:07:45] it's always been the attractant
[1:07:48] the gospel
[1:07:52] it's the light
[1:07:54] he was saying another way the
[1:07:55] supernatural
[1:07:56] has always attracted the attention of
[1:07:58] the believer
[1:08:00] the supernatural the gospel
[1:08:03] it is in its simplicity it's the
[1:08:05] greatest drawing card the world has ever
[1:08:08] known jesus said when he was here on
[1:08:11] earth if i be lifted up i'll draw all
[1:08:13] men unto me black white yellow brown
[1:08:16] whatever color whatever race the gospel
[1:08:19] still holds a center of attraction to
[1:08:22] every man and every woman
[1:08:24] it's the light
[1:08:26] we would see in proverbs 4 and verse 18
[1:08:29] it says the path of the just
[1:08:32] is as a shining light
[1:08:34] the path of the just is as a shining
[1:08:36] light and that shineth more and more
[1:08:40] unto perfect day
[1:08:42] did you hear that
[1:08:44] more and more so if you've been going 20
[1:08:47] 30 40 years you have no excuse according
[1:08:50] to the word of god for your light to be
[1:08:52] dimmer than when it was when it first
[1:08:53] started
[1:08:55] because if we're not going by man-made
[1:08:57] light
[1:08:58] what was only if truly what was born on
[1:09:00] the inside of you it will not dim it
[1:09:03] will not go down it will not diminish
[1:09:05] because it's not a man-made light
[1:09:08] it's a god light it's an eternal life
[1:09:11] and it'll keep burning it'll keep
[1:09:13] burning he said onto perfect day
[1:09:16] it'll actually get brighter and brighter
[1:09:19] and brighter it'll shine more and more
[1:09:22] and more the greater
[1:09:27] so if your light's dimming down you
[1:09:29] might ought to check your light
[1:09:31] and see if it's truly a godlight
[1:09:35] if you say well well brother timothy we
[1:09:37] all got ups and downs yeah but the light
[1:09:39] don't change
[1:09:42] we all go through valleys and darkness
[1:09:44] and valleys and hills and yeah but the
[1:09:45] light don't change amen the light that
[1:09:49] is it isn't going to go out but it's
[1:09:51] going to shine brighter
[1:09:53] and brighter that's why you ought to be
[1:09:55] looking for a new and fresh experience
[1:09:58] every day
[1:10:00] not just when you come to church not
[1:10:02] just once a month or once a year or new
[1:10:04] years every day
[1:10:06] god if i don't do anything more today i
[1:10:08] want to love you more and serve you
[1:10:09] better
[1:10:11] i want my fire to grow brighter i want
[1:10:13] my light to grow brighter amen the
[1:10:15] darker it is i want it to be because it
[1:10:17] says in the very next verse it says the
[1:10:19] way of the wicked is as darkness and
[1:10:21] they know not at what they stumble
[1:10:23] another translation would say the ways
[1:10:25] of the right living people
[1:10:27] glow with light it glows with light amen
[1:10:32] amen and the longer they live the
[1:10:35] brighter they shine
[1:10:39] amen so they've got to get kind of
[1:10:41] throws a curveball and some of you
[1:10:43] people that wants to say well i'll tell
[1:10:44] you what you just serve god 40 years and
[1:10:46] see where you're at
[1:10:49] you ought to be brighter
[1:10:51] it ought to be more coming to your light
[1:10:55] you ought to be
[1:10:56] building it up and saying god i want to
[1:10:58] do whatever i can for this light to
[1:11:00] shine out as far as it can shine
[1:11:03] and as bright as it can shine
[1:11:05] amen so now but we know that there is a
[1:11:08] false light and there is a true light
[1:11:10] but both attract
[1:11:12] amen both have a drawing power but one
[1:11:15] glows and one shines
[1:11:18] now you know it took me a while to get
[1:11:19] to kind of get an understanding because
[1:11:21] brother brandon would use this term he
[1:11:22] says the gospel glows the world shines
[1:11:25] and we just sing the song tonight shine
[1:11:26] on me lord shine on me amen but what
[1:11:29] it's speaking about is actually the glow
[1:11:32] is not just a reflection of light it's
[1:11:34] it's an inward power it's not you know
[1:11:37] you can take a mirror and you can
[1:11:38] reflect this light but it wouldn't have
[1:11:40] no heat in it it wouldn't have nothing
[1:11:42] to you know no no self preserving light
[1:11:45] amen if you break the mirror the light's
[1:11:47] gone that's inside of it but a glow has
[1:11:49] an inward power there's something
[1:11:52] because see god was not just interested
[1:11:54] in him being the light he wanted to also
[1:11:56] give power to you to be sons and
[1:11:58] daughters of god in other words he
[1:12:00] wanted to light your life up
[1:12:03] that you could also be a light amen amen
[1:12:07] sir it's a it's also a glow means it has
[1:12:09] a radiant heat it has a life inside of
[1:12:12] it one is a reflector of another light
[1:12:15] and one is a maker of light
[1:12:17] the word is reflecting amen the world is
[1:12:20] reflecting another kingdom but the
[1:12:22] children of god is not just reflecting
[1:12:25] the kingdom the kingdom is living on the
[1:12:27] inside of him and there is a globe
[1:12:30] there's amen there's something moving
[1:12:32] there's a power that radiates from the
[1:12:34] inside of them
[1:12:36] this is why in romans 12 and verse 11 in
[1:12:39] the amplified bible it says never lack
[1:12:42] and seal an earnest endeavor but be a
[1:12:45] glow and burning with the spirit of god
[1:12:48] amen our lives should never lack and
[1:12:50] seal our earnest earnestness about this
[1:12:54] gospel but our lives should always be a
[1:12:56] glow because it's not a temporary light
[1:13:00] and darkness can't do nothing about it
[1:13:03] it's going to burn no matter how dark it
[1:13:05] gets it's going to burn no matter how
[1:13:08] gloomy it gets this light will burn no
[1:13:10] matter how hard the trial you go through
[1:13:12] and the darkness you face and the
[1:13:14] situation and the sickness it'll still
[1:13:17] burn out and blow and glow out and give
[1:13:20] a light to a dying world
[1:13:23] it's not just an outward shine
[1:13:25] but a glow a burning with the spirit of
[1:13:28] god you know you can look over there
[1:13:30] let's see i don't see one that's very
[1:13:32] visible right now
[1:13:34] but there's all over here there's
[1:13:35] electric plugs
[1:13:37] electric plug can look like a plug and
[1:13:39] have the characteristics of a plug have
[1:13:40] the screws in the right place have the
[1:13:42] cover just right and all the counts look
[1:13:44] like electric plug but won't give power
[1:13:47] to nothing
[1:13:49] unless there's this hook to a source
[1:13:53] it has to have it's got to be hooked to
[1:13:55] a source
[1:13:56] and then you can plug a vacuum cleaner
[1:13:58] in it and it'll run you can plug an iron
[1:14:00] in it and it'll run you can plug a blow
[1:14:03] dryer in it and it'll run but you can
[1:14:04] plug it in there all day long and if it
[1:14:06] ain't connected to the source or there's
[1:14:08] some issue somewhere it ain't going to
[1:14:10] do what it ain't going to do nothing
[1:14:11] it'll look pretty it'll look right it'll
[1:14:14] be just like man this should work
[1:14:17] and this is where the church is
[1:14:19] looks like a church
[1:14:21] smells like a church
[1:14:23] feels like a church in some ways
[1:14:25] it's got some attributes of being a
[1:14:27] church the cover's just right looks
[1:14:29] looks looks pretty
[1:14:31] but then it ain't connected to a source
[1:14:34] therefore it can't give power there's no
[1:14:36] power there amen until it's hooked over
[1:14:38] to a source of electricity it just it
[1:14:41] just looks right but once it's hooked
[1:14:43] power begins to search for and it'll
[1:14:45] begin to power anything that's plugged
[1:14:48] into it same with the church
[1:14:50] amen you can put a druggie in there and
[1:14:52] it'll get attached to that same power
[1:14:54] source it'll begin to move in parts and
[1:14:56] places that that man had never
[1:14:58] experienced on any drug before he had
[1:15:00] never experienced on any alcohol before
[1:15:03] he had never experienced none of that
[1:15:04] before why it's plugged into the same
[1:15:07] source as the power of light comes from
[1:15:10] that said let there be light
[1:15:15] you know there's a thing called fool's
[1:15:17] gold
[1:15:18] it looks like gold
[1:15:20] it even shines and glistens more than
[1:15:22] gold
[1:15:24] but you can buy a bottle of water with
[1:15:26] it
[1:15:28] it has no buying power it's worthless
[1:15:31] ain't even worth the stuff that you can
[1:15:32] have a glob over that big and it's worth
[1:15:34] nothing
[1:15:35] but it looks great shines great there's
[1:15:38] been a lot of people through the years
[1:15:39] been been shocked by what they thought
[1:15:41] was a fortune and they find out it ain't
[1:15:43] nothing and they
[1:15:46] it's gonna be a lot of people like that
[1:15:47] on that day
[1:15:49] thought they had a lot of gold
[1:15:51] a lot of glistening a lot of glow and a
[1:15:52] lot of a lot of glitter and
[1:15:57] brother branham talks about this he says
[1:16:00] he said i i was up there with brother
[1:16:02] sophomore one time in a mine
[1:16:05] and i got there and dug out a bunch of
[1:16:06] what looked exactly like gold
[1:16:10] but the only way you can tell it isn't
[1:16:12] gold it shines better than gold
[1:16:15] it shines
[1:16:16] gold doesn't shine it glows
[1:16:20] that's why it's called fool's gold
[1:16:22] it's not even worth as much as the rock
[1:16:24] that's in it
[1:16:25] it's called iron pyrite scientists talk
[1:16:28] about it how that the waters and the
[1:16:30] acids couldn't get through it
[1:16:32] and to bring it to a place that it could
[1:16:34] become gold
[1:16:37] did you hear that
[1:16:41] so it shines better but it don't have
[1:16:43] the same chemicals
[1:16:46] it looks better but it don't have the
[1:16:48] life or the buying power
[1:16:50] you can take a little almost you can't
[1:16:52] even see a little piece of gold dust and
[1:16:54] by way more you can buy maybe a bottle
[1:16:56] of water i don't know how much a piece
[1:16:58] of gold doesn't be worth but it's worth
[1:16:59] money and the way i understand gold's
[1:17:02] going up and worth a fortune right now
[1:17:04] amen even more more than ever but you
[1:17:06] know you could take that big old honking
[1:17:08] you could barely carry it in and you'd
[1:17:10] be so proud of it it's shining it's
[1:17:12] glistening and it's heaven you're just
[1:17:13] having a good time and you put it and
[1:17:15] place it on the counter and they tell
[1:17:17] you it ain't even worth a bottle of
[1:17:18] water
[1:17:21] this is where people are
[1:17:23] in their lives what they think is gold
[1:17:26] they're gonna find out as fools
[1:17:28] go what they thought they could buy
[1:17:31] eternal life with is going to be worth
[1:17:33] nothing when it comes that day
[1:17:36] i want something that glows
[1:17:38] i want something that's got power in it
[1:17:40] i want a gospel that's got life in he
[1:17:42] said
[1:17:43] he said i've been a prospector you know
[1:17:45] fool's gold shines brighter and real
[1:17:46] gold it glitters everything glitters is
[1:17:49] not gold gold doesn't glitter it glows
[1:17:51] the hollywood it'll glitter why he says
[1:17:53] but the gospel glows with humility
[1:17:56] hollywood shines with his great churches
[1:17:58] and his psychological teachings and
[1:18:01] and educated ministers who can speak and
[1:18:03] use their nouns and pronouns and
[1:18:05] everything exactly right but in humility
[1:18:07] the gospel of jesus christ glows to the
[1:18:10] glory of god amen he would say in
[1:18:12] another place he said we we need not to
[1:18:14] shine we need to glow amen we need to
[1:18:18] glow with the power of god glow with the
[1:18:20] gospel of god let the power of god be
[1:18:23] moving inside of us
[1:18:26] amen amen let it let it move he said but
[1:18:29] the problem is the church is losing
[1:18:30] their identification you come on he said
[1:18:33] we come on wednesday night well some of
[1:18:35] us others stay home at that time who
[1:18:37] loved who loved sushi or lucy was going
[1:18:39] on all kind of other worldly things kind
[1:18:41] of
[1:18:41] entertainments keep you away from church
[1:18:43] he said we've lost it long ago our
[1:18:45] seminaries our schools bunch of rickies
[1:18:47] with a lot of theology and entertainment
[1:18:49] and a lot of psychology we took dress we
[1:18:52] took this we took that a lot of glitter
[1:18:55] but no glow
[1:18:57] he said we let them come over amen and
[1:18:59] you know we go over on their ground he
[1:19:00] said but what we need to do is let them
[1:19:02] come on our ground where the real
[1:19:04] baptism of the holy ghost is glowing in
[1:19:07] the power of resurrection it's not
[1:19:09] trying to build a church like this it's
[1:19:11] not trying to be able to have a pastor
[1:19:13] like that or to cooperate something with
[1:19:15] the world they shine with hollywood but
[1:19:17] the gospel glows with power
[1:19:21] and the eagle will see it every time
[1:19:23] they don't look for a shine they look
[1:19:26] for a glow
[1:19:27] they look for the power on the inside
[1:19:31] not some little glitter and glamour
[1:19:34] you know and
[1:19:35] carry on
[1:19:37] we want something with life on the
[1:19:38] inside of it
[1:19:42] you know sister anna paris actually
[1:19:44] brought this to my attention
[1:19:46] she's good at that
[1:19:48] i don't know if y'all know sister allen
[1:19:49] yet or not she's moved to our church
[1:19:51] with the paris family
[1:19:53] lovely sister she got a lot of facts
[1:19:56] she studies a lot apparently don't mean
[1:19:58] to embarrass you
[1:20:00] but man she's she's full of good facts
[1:20:04] and last wednesday i was preaching on
[1:20:06] light
[1:20:07] and she googled it it was brought to my
[1:20:09] attention about bugs
[1:20:10] because
[1:20:11] i was talking about the windshield or
[1:20:13] the lights on your car you'll go home
[1:20:15] and there'll be a lot of bugs come out
[1:20:17] right
[1:20:19] they're looking for something
[1:20:20] and i want to bring this right in here
[1:20:22] because we're looking for a gospel that
[1:20:23] don't glitter or a false light we're
[1:20:26] looking for a glow a power
[1:20:29] but a bug don't just go to a light to
[1:20:31] die
[1:20:33] you know a bug don't fly out of the
[1:20:35] forest tonight so you know what
[1:20:36] good night to die
[1:20:39] no no
[1:20:41] actually it's a theory you know it has
[1:20:43] to be a theory because apparently you
[1:20:44] can't ask a bug and this is really what
[1:20:46] happens but scientists that have studied
[1:20:48] this said the theory is there's many of
[1:20:50] them that feed on nectar from flowers
[1:20:53] which are known to reflect ultraviolet
[1:20:55] light some light bulbs give off a small
[1:20:57] amount of ultraviolet light potentially
[1:21:00] causing hungry bugs to mistake a bulb
[1:21:03] for flowers
[1:21:05] that's powerful right there because you
[1:21:07] begin to realize people don't go to
[1:21:09] places they go to to die
[1:21:12] they go there because they're attracted
[1:21:14] to a light but they don't realize it's a
[1:21:16] glitter and not a globe therefore i mean
[1:21:19] you know a person don't join a methodist
[1:21:20] church or any other kind of denomination
[1:21:22] because there's some evil person they
[1:21:24] join that because they are a hungry
[1:21:26] person they're hungering for the thing
[1:21:29] even a person many times don't don't
[1:21:31] become an alcoholic or a druggie because
[1:21:33] they want to be an evil person and steal
[1:21:35] and pillage and destroy but no there's
[1:21:38] something on the inside of them a
[1:21:39] god-given thirst and they go to the
[1:21:42] wrong source
[1:21:44] amen this is where we find people even
[1:21:46] message ranks that have found themselves
[1:21:48] amen disillusioned and things they
[1:21:50] didn't go there to a false light because
[1:21:53] they were a bad person they went there
[1:21:55] amen because they were hungry
[1:21:59] hallelujah but if you are hungry tonight
[1:22:02] there is something that'll feed you
[1:22:04] there is a real life that'll give you
[1:22:06] strength that'll give you nourishment
[1:22:08] that'll bring you back to where you
[1:22:10] belong
[1:22:16] but it won't glitter
[1:22:19] it won't be maybe the best dressed
[1:22:20] people on the planet
[1:22:24] you know they got their
[1:22:25] they got their tie just right and their
[1:22:27] clothes just right and they're dressed
[1:22:28] to the tens and they got their cuff
[1:22:30] links on and man they can dress the part
[1:22:33] but inside of them they're dark
[1:22:36] and a demon for ever every cage of every
[1:22:39] unclean and hateful bird
[1:22:42] you didn't go there because you was a
[1:22:44] bad person
[1:22:45] you went there because you was hungry
[1:22:49] but there is a place to be fed
[1:22:51] there is a true light
[1:22:53] amen there is something that can move
[1:22:56] and take take that pain away from you
[1:22:59] they can take that discouragement away
[1:23:00] from you they can take that hurt away
[1:23:02] from you they can take those saying
[1:23:04] there is a true light
[1:23:06] and it glows with the power of almighty
[1:23:08] god that's why we got to preach a gospel
[1:23:10] that not only amen not that we we're not
[1:23:13] interested in one that can just produce
[1:23:14] an alcoholic anonymous meeting and you
[1:23:17] just go and you just continue on as you
[1:23:19] are no we got to have a gospel that has
[1:23:21] such a glow about it that there's a
[1:23:23] power of god on the inside that it ain't
[1:23:25] going to let you remain the same but
[1:23:27] it's going to change you it's going to
[1:23:28] mold you it's going to make you amen
[1:23:30] it's going to show you the light of the
[1:23:32] word amen he said see when people are
[1:23:34] hungry they'll eat from anywhere if a
[1:23:36] child is starving or a person is charmed
[1:23:38] they may have used to eat from a fine
[1:23:40] table but they get hungry they'll eat
[1:23:41] from a garbage can he said but when
[1:23:44] they're hungry they'll eat somewhere he
[1:23:45] said that's why i think real true
[1:23:47] ministers of the gospel ought to be up
[1:23:49] and going ought to be giving the people
[1:23:51] the right things
[1:23:53] meet and do season a gospel that lives
[1:23:57] a gospel that glows a gospel that has
[1:24:00] strengths
[1:24:05] there is a true light
[1:24:08] there is something with life that will
[1:24:09] attract
[1:24:11] and feel the believers hunger
[1:24:13] and heart
[1:24:15] there is a gospel
[1:24:17] that a pool
[1:24:20] there's a light
[1:24:22] that'll pull the believer
[1:24:23] it was a light that was walking down a
[1:24:25] dusty road
[1:24:26] and up on the hill was a woman had a
[1:24:29] blood issue
[1:24:30] what attracted her that light
[1:24:33] it was all kind of people saying false
[1:24:35] prophets saying this that and the other
[1:24:36] but she saw through all of that
[1:24:38] and she saw the true light that was
[1:24:40] being lifted up
[1:24:42] amen there was many that that we could
[1:24:43] go through the lepers and the blind and
[1:24:46] the halt and lane amen that would find
[1:24:49] real true attraction when nothing else
[1:24:51] could help them they'd went to false
[1:24:53] lights they'd went to places and they
[1:24:55] just cast them out and put them out and
[1:24:57] they was out on the streets begging but
[1:24:58] all of a sudden a real light would walk
[1:25:00] by
[1:25:01] and this light was bright enough it
[1:25:03] would light up a blind man he even a
[1:25:04] blind man could see it and he'd begin to
[1:25:07] scream out god have mercy on me
[1:25:09] move on my heart and my life amen
[1:25:11] brother brown will you go listen to that
[1:25:13] message i've been trying to get to it
[1:25:14] but what is attraction on the mount amen
[1:25:17] he said what was it it was the word
[1:25:19] being manifested being fulfilled that
[1:25:21] attracted the believer
[1:25:26] what attracted us to where we are today
[1:25:29] is the word being fulfilled
[1:25:31] it's the word being made manifest it's
[1:25:34] the word
[1:25:36] coming to free fruition in our
[1:25:38] lives
[1:25:40] brother ron spencer made one of the most
[1:25:42] amazing statements at a youth camp one
[1:25:44] time
[1:25:45] he said if this message
[1:25:47] don't produce the same overcoming life
[1:25:49] in me that it did in william branham i
[1:25:52] don't want nothing to do with it
[1:25:56] there has there's a power there there's
[1:25:58] an attraction not just to a miracle yes
[1:26:01] that does attract
[1:26:03] but it was more than that
[1:26:05] it was the word behind the miracle the
[1:26:08] word that spoke of it and said it would
[1:26:10] be and it attracted our attention and
[1:26:12] that's why we're here and we're looking
[1:26:13] at it still looking at it even past all
[1:26:16] the chaos and all the critics and all
[1:26:18] the people wants to come up and say this
[1:26:20] was wrong and that was wrong i'm not
[1:26:22] looking at none of that my eyes is on
[1:26:24] the light
[1:26:25] and this light is glowing this is where
[1:26:27] the people were as he was coming off the
[1:26:28] mount of olives on a white donkey
[1:26:30] walking down the hill a whole bunch of
[1:26:32] people were screaming frantically
[1:26:34] pulling palm leaves off the trees
[1:26:36] throwing their clothes in the road
[1:26:37] screaming hosanna to the son of god that
[1:26:40] comes in the name of the lord what had
[1:26:41] brought them there the light had brought
[1:26:43] them there the word being manifested
[1:26:45] brought them there the anointed messiah
[1:26:47] the hour was walking down was coming
[1:26:49] down the road he said that what was the
[1:26:52] attraction up there on the hill it was
[1:26:54] god making history god fulfilling
[1:26:56] prophecy that's what causes an
[1:26:59] attraction
[1:27:00] it's a light shining amen on a darkened
[1:27:04] scripture and all of a sudden it's
[1:27:05] fulfilled
[1:27:07] and you're looking like wow it just
[1:27:09] happened
[1:27:11] where are we at
[1:27:13] and it illuminates
[1:27:16] it's going to illuminate to some people
[1:27:18] when they see bombs dropping
[1:27:20] and all of a sudden words being
[1:27:22] fulfilled but it's going to be too late
[1:27:26] don't wait till it's too late to come to
[1:27:28] the light
[1:27:30] there is a true light
[1:27:33] he said sure it causes an attraction
[1:27:36] of course it brings us the vultures it
[1:27:38] brings the critics
[1:27:41] but it also brings the eagles
[1:27:44] hallelujah i'm one of them
[1:27:47] i'm one of them they come together to
[1:27:50] find out what's going on some come for
[1:27:52] curiosity some come to find fault
[1:27:55] some come to criticize all kinds
[1:27:58] together but as we said make believers
[1:28:00] believers unbelievers what's on the
[1:28:01] mountain prophecies being fulfilled
[1:28:04] what's happening in our day prophecy is
[1:28:06] being fulfilled what is the attraction
[1:28:09] that's going on in tonight why are you
[1:28:11] here
[1:28:12] because prophecy is being fulfilled
[1:28:17] light is dawning on scriptures
[1:28:20] and it's
[1:28:24] like a roman candle being blowed out
[1:28:27] and light's coming and light's coming
[1:28:30] the light's coming why you still believe
[1:28:32] the message of the hour brother timothy
[1:28:34] because it's light
[1:28:39] it glows
[1:28:40] it has a power
[1:28:42] that i haven't found anywhere else
[1:28:45] it's a power that'll keep me in my
[1:28:47] darkest hours
[1:28:48] it's a power that'll keep me when i'm
[1:28:50] going through the darkest trial of my
[1:28:52] life
[1:28:53] and i can say like job though god slay
[1:28:56] me
[1:28:56] yet i'll trust him
[1:29:00] why are you here
[1:29:01] why are you sitting here on these pews
[1:29:03] tonight
[1:29:04] because of light
[1:29:07] you've been attracted not to a building
[1:29:09] not to a man
[1:29:10] not to some polished up scholar
[1:29:13] not to some man that could put all of
[1:29:15] his words together and it flowed just
[1:29:16] like just perfectly but you're seeing
[1:29:19] scripture being fulfilled
[1:29:21] and light is flashing and it's moving
[1:29:23] like never before and light is getting
[1:29:25] greater and greater and greater
[1:29:28] and as i said last wednesday don't worry
[1:29:31] it's dark but right behind the darkness
[1:29:33] is the greatest light that's ever shined
[1:29:36] the eternal brightened and
[1:29:38] shining day that'll be an eternal day
[1:29:40] never to be dark again oh my could you
[1:29:43] imagine breaking in that day and never
[1:29:45] having another mind battle
[1:29:48] never having the word fear enter into
[1:29:50] your mind anymore or the feeling of fear
[1:29:52] or the sensation of fear or the worry
[1:29:55] and the dread that's what we're going to
[1:29:58] but yes it's getting darker but it's
[1:30:00] getting darker because light is pushing
[1:30:03] it's getting darker because light is
[1:30:05] dawning and it's pushing against the
[1:30:07] darkness and darkness is trying to hold
[1:30:09] it back but it can't do it it can't hold
[1:30:12] it back amen just in case you thought i
[1:30:14] was crazy the other wednesday i found
[1:30:16] something this this evening amen in the
[1:30:18] church age book he said through the dark
[1:30:20] ages we'll see children of the flesh
[1:30:22] persecute and destroy the children of
[1:30:23] the spirit though both claim one father
[1:30:26] even in the case of ishmael and isaac
[1:30:28] the darkness of spiritual corruption
[1:30:30] will deepen and the true light of god
[1:30:32] will fade until number wise it'll grow
[1:30:34] so faintly yet the promise of god will
[1:30:37] hold true
[1:30:39] the light shineth in darkness and
[1:30:42] darkness can do nothing about it
[1:30:46] hallelujah amen they can criticize they
