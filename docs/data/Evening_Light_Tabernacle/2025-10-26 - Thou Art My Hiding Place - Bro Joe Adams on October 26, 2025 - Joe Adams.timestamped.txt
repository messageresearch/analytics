[47:21] Father,
[47:23] that's our desire today, Lord, is just
[47:25] to have you come, Lord, not only for
[47:28] that meeting in the air, but come in
[47:30] this service today. Father, may you come
[47:32] and minister to hearts and to [music]
[47:34] lives, Lord.
[47:36] Lord, as brother Johnny prayed, Father,
[47:39] asking [music] for the presence of the
[47:40] Lord to draw nigh to each and every
[47:42] individual. Lord, you know exactly
[47:46] precisely what we have need of this
[47:48] morning. And Lord, as we had heard, this
[47:50] is a predestinated moment. You knew who
[47:54] who all would be in attendance today,
[47:56] Lord. [music]
[47:56] Those that would be on the stream, those
[47:58] that would be present. And father, we
[48:00] just inviting you to come. Come Jesus.
[48:04] Come. Come today, God, and fight our
[48:07] battles. Come today, God, and Lord,
[48:09] relinquish us from the fears that we

[48:16] peace that surpasses, Lord, all
[48:18] understanding. God, come today, Lord,
[48:20] and move as only you can. as the great
[48:23] creator of heavens and earth. God, we
[48:25] ask to and we invite you, God, to come
[48:27] and just speak mightily, speak boldly,
[48:30] speak precisely, God. Lord, do the work
[48:32] of a surgeon this morning, Father, and
[48:35] just begin to go down the aisles of our
[48:37] heart today, Father, and minister, Lord.
[48:41] We invite you, God, and we commit
[48:43] [music] this service to you now, Lord,
[48:45] in Jesus name.
[48:47] Amen. Well, we bring greetings to you
[48:49] this morning. Great to be home. We were
[48:52] just in Los Angeles last weekend. We did
[48:55] a wedding there. Uh first wedding I've
[48:57] ever done, brother Mike. And it was a
[49:00] Hispanic wedding and the brother there
[49:02] was a pastor in West Cavina and he had
[49:04] asked me about a year ago. He said,
[49:05] "When I get married, I want you to do my
[49:06] wedding." And I'm going to tell you, it
[49:10] was an experience of a lifetime. We had
[49:13] a wonderful time. And you know, they do
[49:16] things different, different culture, but
[49:17] we had a wonderful time. and the brother
[49:19] and his wife now are happily married and
[49:22] he's a very intense brother kind of like
[49:24] brother Tim just word word just always
[49:26] focused on on study and everything but
[49:28] he had a smile on his face I said but
[49:31] it's the best day of your life and it
[49:34] was and we got him happily married and
[49:36] then we we my wife and I flew down to
[49:39] Gulf Shores for a few days of vacation
[49:41] we drove in yesterday so we're here to
[49:43] be in service with you this morning and
[49:45] trust that the Lord to speak to us I
[49:46] want to speak to you this morning know,
[49:49] thou art my hiding place.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; We're going to look at this here. And
[49:55] you know, the kids kind of made a
[49:57] comment this morning that, you know,
[49:58] never no matter who's preaching on
[49:59] Sunday, the service is always kind of
[50:01] lean kind of tend to go long. So, we're
[50:03] just going to try to follow the Lord's
[50:05] leadership today. And I'm not going to
[50:07] cut it short just to cut it short
[50:09] because I'm short, but we're going to
[50:11] we're going to follow the leadership of
[50:12] the Lord this morning and just trust by
[50:15] God's grace he'll speak to us. Here we
[50:17] find here in Psalms 32 and verse one.
[50:19] We're going to read the entire chapter
[50:21] of Psalms 32 and just trust we'll hear
[50:24] from the Lord this morning. It says,
[50:27] "Blessed is he whose transgressions is
[50:30] forgiven and whose sins is covered."
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord
[50:38] imputed not iniquity and in whose spirit
[50:41] there is no gal.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; When I kept silence, my bones waxed.
[50:45] cold through my roaring all the day
[50:47] long. For day and night thy hand was
[50:50] heavy upon me. My moisture is turned
[50:52] into draw of summer. I acknowledged my
[50:55] sin unto thee. My iniquity have not I
[50:58] hid. I said, I will confess my
[51:00] transgression unto the Lord, and thou
[51:02] forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Sah,
[51:06] for this shall everyone that is godly
[51:08] pray unto thee in a time when thou
[51:10] mayest be found. Surely in the floods of
[51:13] great waters they shall not over they
[51:15] shall not come nigh unto him.
[51:18] Verse seven, for thou art my hiding
[51:21] place. Thou shalt preserve me from
[51:24] trouble. Thou shalt compass me about
[51:27] with songs of deliverance. Say I will
[51:30] instruct thee and teach thee in the way
[51:32] which thou shalt go. And I will guide
[51:34] thee with my eye. Be you not as a horse
[51:37] or as a mule which has no understanding,
[51:40] whose mouth be held with a bit and a and
[51:42] a bridal, lest they come near unto thee.
[51:45] Many sorrows shall be to the wicked. But
[51:48] he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy
[51:50] shall compass him about. Be glad in the
[51:53] Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous, and
[51:55] shout for joy, all ye that are upright
[51:58] in heart. God bless you. You can have
[51:59] your seats this morning.
[52:05] We just want to make everyone welcome. I
[52:06] believe we have a a visitor here with us
[52:09] this morning. I want to make you
[52:10] welcome. May God bless you today in the
[52:11] presence of the Lord. But we want to
[52:13] look here. As I said, we're going to
[52:14] kind of take this thought for a little
[52:16] while this morning on thou art my hiding
[52:19] place. And David, as we find David was a
[52:23] man that was well acquainted with
[52:25] difficulties. We look here in verse four
[52:28] and the Bible tells us for day and night
[52:30] that the Lord's hand was heavy upon
[52:33] David. And that word heavy there means
[52:35] affliction. So David knew what it he
[52:38] knew what it felt like, brother Johnny,
[52:39] to go through difficulties and
[52:41] afflictions of life. And he was a man
[52:44] that was well acquainted with hiding,
[52:46] whether he was hiding from Saul, whether
[52:48] he was hiding from the Philistines, or
[52:50] whether he was hiding from his own son
[52:52] Abselon. And we find in the scriptures
[52:55] in 1st Samuel 18 and vers 11. You don't
[52:57] have to turn there, but here we find him
[52:59] hiding from Saul's spear. And then we go
[53:02] into 1st Samuel 9 and 18. He's hiding at
[53:05] Naoth and Rama when they were sent to
[53:08] capture him. When Saul sent men to
[53:10] capture him, then he was hiding with
[53:12] Jonathan. They're in the field there.
[53:14] And then at N with the priest in Gath
[53:17] among the Philistines where he pretended
[53:19] madness before Akish. He hid in the cave
[53:22] of Adullum. He hid in the wilderness in
[53:24] the strongholds of Judah. He hid in the
[53:26] cave of Engeti. He hid in the wilderness
[53:28] of Zip. He hid with the Philistines and
[53:31] Ziglag. And he ran and he fled to
[53:33] Jerusalem when Abselon was rebelling
[53:36] against him. So David knew what it felt
[53:38] like to be on the run. He knew WHAT IT
[53:40] FELT LIKE TO TO TO HIDE AND TO BE IN
[53:44] FEAR OF HIS LIFE. BUT I WANT YOU TO
[53:46] UNDERSTAND AND I WANT YOU TO NOTICE when
[53:47] we look here IN EVERYWHERE DAVID FOUND
[53:50] HIMSELF. NO MATTER WHAT THE PERSECUTIONS
[53:52] WERE, NO MATTER WHAT THE DIFFICULTIES
[53:54] WERE OF his his life, HE WHETHER HE WAS
[53:57] HIDING IN THE STRONGHOLDS of Judah or
[53:59] the plains of Engeti or you know no
[54:02] matter where it was, DAVID NEVER GAVE
[54:04] CREDIT TO THOSE PLACES FOR HIS
[54:06] PROTECTION. BUT DAVID COMPLETELY GAVE
[54:09] ALL THE HONOR AND ALL THE GLORY. HE SAID
[54:11] THAT THOU ART MY HIDING PLACE. SO NO
[54:15] MATTER WHERE DAVID FOUND HIMSELF, NO
[54:17] MATTER WHAT TIME AND SEASONS OF LIFE HE
[54:20] WALKED THROUGH, DAVID DIDN'T GIVE CREDIT
[54:22] TO, YOU KNOW, HIS OWN HUMAN ABILITIES TO
[54:25] OUTSMART THIS ONE AND OUTRUN THAT ONE,
[54:27] BUT HE GAVE ALL CREDIT TO GOD.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; AND DAVID KNEW THAT AS LONG AS GOD WAS
[54:33] HIS PROTECTION, AS LONG AS GOD WAS HIS
[54:36] HIDING PLACE, THEN HE COULD BE AT REST.
[54:38] NO MATTER WHAT THE DIFFICULTIES OF LIFE
[54:41] THAT HE ENDURED, HE WOULD BE AT REST.
[54:44] AND HE would have peace.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; AND I BELIEVE THAT'S A LESSON FOR ALL OF
[54:48] US THIS MORNING BECAUSE WE LIKE DAVID
[54:50] HAVE VERY VARYING TRIALS AND
[54:52] DIFFICULTIES THAT WE GO THROUGH. WE GO
[54:54] THROUGH SEASONS of life.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Some of us there's springtimes.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Then there's summers where the heat of
[55:01] persecution is on. THEN THERE'S A FALL
[55:03] WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING JUST DIES
[55:05] OUT AND YOU DON'T FEEL THE PRESENCE OF
[55:07] THE LORD. YOU DON'T FEEL THE SPIRIT OF
[55:08] GOD. THEN YOU DRIFT OFF INTO A WINTER
[55:10] WHERE EVERYTHING'S COLD.
[55:12] But there's a springtime.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; There's a springtime COMING FOR ALL OF
[55:18] US as believers. AND AND WE FIND BUT
[55:20] DAVID SAYS THAT THE LORD IS MY HIDING
[55:23] PLACE. THOU ART MY HIDING PLACE. AND
[55:27] THIS WORD HIDING PLACE MEANS A A SECRET
[55:29] PLACE. IT'S A A SHELTER. IT'S A PLACE OF
[55:32] PROTECTION.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE ALSO SAYS NOW, "THOU SHALT
[55:36] PRESERVE ME from trouble."
[55:39] You know, many times we think when we
[55:41] give our heart to the Lord, brother L. I
[55:43] remember when I first became a
[55:44] Christian, I'm thinking, man, I'm going
[55:46] to I'm going to walk with the Lord. I
[55:47] did this and I gave my heart to God and
[55:50] you know, bless God, I got something to
[55:51] do. I'm turning away from my wicked WAYS
[55:53] AND I'M THINKING, MAN, EVERYTHING IS
[55:55] GOING TO BE GREAT. I'M GOING IT'S GOING
[55:56] TO BE A FLOWERY BETTER EASE. BOY, was I
[55:59] disappointed.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; I WAS SHOCKED BEYOND BELIEF. I DIDN'T
[56:03] KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MESSAGE. I
[56:04] didn't know ANYTHING ABOUT A PROPHET. I
[56:06] WAS JUST WALKING AMONGST DENOMINATIONAL
[56:08] BELIEVERS AND I BELIEVE God had that for
[56:10] me for a season AND TIME. BUT I WANT YOU
[56:12] TO KNOW I WAS DUMBFOUNDED WHEN I
[56:14] REALIZED THAT NOW I THOUGHT I HAD HARD
[56:16] TIMES. NOW I REALLY HAD HARD TIMES
[56:19] &gt;&gt; CUZ NOW I'M TRYING TO SERVE GOD. NOW I'M
[56:21] CONVICTED OVER EVERYTHING I DO.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; BUT WE FINALLY THE LORD SAYS DAVID
[56:29] SAYING TO THE LORD, "THOU SHALT PRESERVE
[56:31] ME.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; THOU SHALT PRESERVE ME FROM TROUBLE."
[56:35] NOTICE, NOT FROM HAVING TROUBLE, BUT
[56:38] FROM BEING SWALLOWED UP IN TROUBLE.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; NO, WE ALL HAVE TROUBLE. BUT GOD SAYS,
[56:44] "I WILL BE A [screaming] REFUGE. I WILL
[56:46] BE A HIDING PLACE. I WILL BE A STRONG
[56:49] TOWER. I WILL BE THAT DEFENSE CITY FOR
[56:52] YOU. WHEN YOU HAVE ME, YOU HAVE IT ALL."
[56:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible will tell us in PSALMS 34:19
[56:59] THAT MANY ARE THE afflictions
[57:03] &gt;&gt; of the righteous. Now, how many of
[57:05] you've been afflicted?
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. I want to show our hands.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, a little bit better than that,
[57:12] Shanica.
[57:13] [laughter]
[57:14] &gt;&gt; There we go. Yeah, leave it up there.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; BUT MANY ARE THE AFFLICTIONS
[57:20] [snorts]
[57:21] OF THE RIGHTEOUS. AND THAT WORD
[57:23] AFFLICTIONS MEANS BAD,
[57:25] &gt;&gt; DISAGREEABLE, MALIGNANT, CANCEROUS,
[57:28] UNPLEASANT, GIVING OF PAIN, UNHAPPINESS,
[57:31] MISERY, DISPLEASING. MANY ARE THE
[57:34] AFFLICTIONS OF THE RIGHTEOUS, BUT
[57:37] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. BUT THE LORD,
[57:41] &gt;&gt; THE LORD DELIVERTH THEM OUT OF THEM ALL.
[57:43] THERE'S NOT ONE AFFLICTION. THERE'S NOT
[57:46] ONE TRIAL THAT YOU GO THROUGH. BUT WHAT
[57:48] THE LORD DOESN'T REACH DOWN HIS HAND AND
[57:51] LIFT YOU OUT OF IT.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; CAN I TELL YOU THERE'S A NEW DAY COMING?
[57:55] CAN I TELL YOU THAT SORROW ONLY LASTS
[57:57] FOR A MOMENT, BUT JOY COMETH IN THE
[57:59] MORNING
[58:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD'S MIGHTY HAND REACHES DOWN
[58:03] AND LIFTS YOU UP OUT OF AFFLICTION,
[58:05] BRINGS YOU THROUGH THAT TRIAL, BRINGS
[58:07] YOU THROUGH THAT TRIBULATION.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; We don't find in the scriptures that the
[58:13] believer is overtaken by his
[58:14] afflictions.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; But the righteous have a promise.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; And that's what David could rely on. You
[58:22] know, David without the Holy Ghost could
[58:25] completely, solely, fully rely on God
[58:29] &gt;&gt; and say, "God, no matter where I find
[58:30] myself,
[58:32] no matter what season of life I'm in, no
[58:35] matter if it's sickness, if it's sorrow,
[58:38] IF MY CHILDREN ARE WAVERING, NO MATTER
[58:40] WHAT,
[58:42] &gt;&gt; thou art my hiding place."
[58:46] &gt;&gt; See, AND WE AS CHRISTIANS, WE HAVE good
[58:48] days
[58:49] &gt;&gt; and we have bad days. There's times
[58:51] we're on a mountaintop.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Boy, we love the mountain tops, don't
[58:55] we?
[58:57] &gt;&gt; But then there's times we're in a valley
[58:59] of decision.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; But you know, it's in the valley is
[59:02] where the Christian begins to blossom
[59:04] and bloom and bud out.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; It's in the valley where the things that
[59:08] God placed inside of you begin to come
[59:10] forth.
[59:12] But we enjoy those mountain tops. And
[59:14] you know, maybe we take for granted the
[59:17] valleys.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We take for granted, you know,
[59:23] when things become to be developed. And
[59:24] we're going to kind of look at this. And
[59:26] I I'm not going to focus the entire
[59:27] service on valleys and trials and
[59:30] afflictions. We're going to turn a
[59:31] corner here, but just stay with me for a
[59:33] little bit this morning. BUT WE FIND
[59:35] HERE WE'RE NOT IMMUNE from adversities.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT IMMUNE FROM TRIALS AND
[59:41] HARDSHIPS OF THIS LIFE. BUT I WANT YOU
[59:42] TO UNDERSTAND OUR SAFETY DOES NOT RELY
[59:44] ON OUR HUMAN ABILITIES.
[59:47] You know, IT SEEMS LIKE MANY TIMES WHEN
[59:48] THINGS AREN'T GOING OUR WAY, WE WANT TO
[59:50] HIJACK THE PEN FROM GOD, AS WE HEARD A
[59:52] FEW WEEKS AGO, AND WE WANT TO START
[59:54] WRITING OUR OWN STORY.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; OH, CHURCH, LEAVE THE PEN IN THE
[59:59] ARTHUR'S HAND.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; He knows the END FROM THE BEGINNING. HE
[1:00:02] KNOWS WHERE TO TAKE YOU. HE KNOWS HOW TO
[1:00:04] BRING THINGS IN TO YOU TO COME THROUGH
[1:00:07] TO DEVELOP YOU CUZ HE HAS IN MIND
[1:00:10] EXACTLY WHAT each of us here today will
[1:00:12] BE LIKE.
[1:00:14] BUT WE FIND OUR SAFETY DOESN'T REST IN
[1:00:16] PSYCHOLOGY. IT DOESN'T REST IN OUR OWN
[1:00:18] HUMAN ABILITIES. IT DOESN'T REST IN HOW
[1:00:20] INTELLIGENT WE ARE. IT DOESN'T REST IN
[1:00:22] ANY MAN-MADE SYSTEMS OR TRADITIONS. OUR
[1:00:25] SAFETY AND OUR PROTECTION RESTS SOLELY
[1:00:28] in the unfailing word of God.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; AND HE HAS TO BE this has to be your
[1:00:35] hiding place. WHEN THINGS AREN'T GOING
[1:00:37] YOUR WAY, YOU come back to this word.
[1:00:40] Yes.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; You come back and you find the promise
[1:00:43] that lays in the scriptures.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Brother would tell us now, they that
[1:00:47] overcome shall inherit all things. They
[1:00:48] that overcome.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; He goes, YOU HAVE POWER TO DO IT, BUT
[1:00:53] YOU MUST BE WILLING TO LAY IT DOWN. YOU
[1:00:55] SEE, GOD COULD NOT PUSH YOU THROUGH A
[1:00:56] LITTLE PIPE. PULL US OUT ON THE OTHER
[1:00:59] SIDE AND THEN SAY, "OH, BLESSED IS HE
[1:01:01] THAT OVERCOMETH." HE SAYS, "YOU HAD
[1:01:03] NOTHING TO OVERCOME. HE JUST PUSHED YOU
[1:01:05] THROUGH. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A
[1:01:07] DECISION FOR YOURSELF AND I GOT TO MAKE
[1:01:08] DECISIONS FOR MYSELF. AND IN DOING THAT,
[1:01:11] WE SHOW OUR FAITH AND OUR RESPECTS to
[1:01:13] God.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand Satan Satan
[1:01:19] is only limited to what he can do.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; You realize that he could not drown Noah
[1:01:24] in the flood until God's purpose for
[1:01:26] Noah's life was finished.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; He could not burn up the Hebrew children
[1:01:31] until the purpose of God had been
[1:01:32] finished. He could not kill Job WITH
[1:01:35] BALLS AND THE TROUBLES THAT HE WENT
[1:01:37] THROUGH until God's purpose for his life
[1:01:39] HAD BEEN FINISHED. HE COULD NOT TAKE
[1:01:41] DANIEL and throw him in a den of lions
[1:01:43] and and HAVE THE LIONS TO DESTROY HIS
[1:01:45] LIFE UNTIL GOD'S PURPOSE FOR DANIEL HAS
[1:01:47] BEEN FINISHED. Neither could he TAKE UH
[1:01:49] TO ABRAHAM DIE OF OLD AGE UNTIL THAT
[1:01:52] PROMISED SON, THE PURPOSE THAT GOD HAD
[1:01:54] FOR ABRAHAM HAD BEEN FINISHED. AND
[1:01:56] BROTHER B WILL TELL US AND NEITHER CAN
[1:01:58] IT TAKE YOU
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; NOR CAN IT TAKE ME UNTIL THE PURPOSE OF
[1:02:05] GOD OUR LIFE IS FINISHED. SO WE GATHER
[1:02:08] FROM THERE A CONSOLATION. OTHERWISE THIS
[1:02:11] WORD IS OUR HIDING PLACE. NO MATTER WHAT
[1:02:14] BEFALLS US NO MATTER WHAT WE GO THROUGH
[1:02:16] NO MATTER WHAT SEASON OF LIFE. AS LONG
[1:02:19] AS WE HAVE HIM AS A HIDING PLACE,
[1:02:22] THERE'S NOTHING THAT THE DEVIL CAN DO
[1:02:24] THAT CAN DESTROY YOU UNTIL GOD'S PURPOSE
[1:02:26] FOR YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN FINISHED.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; What a peace we can have.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; What a comfort we can have.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean it's going to be easy.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; But we can find peace.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; You know, THERE'S A SAYING, HARD TIMES
[1:02:41] create strong men. Strong men create
[1:02:43] good times. Good times create weak men
[1:02:45] and weak men create hard times.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; See, it suggests that hardships build
[1:02:50] character and strength. And a lot of
[1:02:53] times when everything is going smooth,
[1:02:56] life is great,
[1:02:59] we don't recognize God the way we
[1:03:01] should.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; We don't pray the way we should. We
[1:03:04] don't read our Bibles the way we should.
[1:03:07] We don't listen to sermons the way we
[1:03:09] should. We don't feed the way we should.
[1:03:12] Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN WE'RE PROSPERING FINANCIALLY
[1:03:16] AND THE KIDS ARE HEALTHY AND THERE'S NO
[1:03:17] TROUBLES, WE'RE enjoying great times,
[1:03:20] that's when it creates soft Christians.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, everything's smooth. Everything's
[1:03:29] great at the Adams house.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Man, everybody looking in from the
[1:03:35] outside. Armchair quarterback. I WISH I
[1:03:38] WAS IN ADAMS.
[1:03:41] OH, but you don't understand what goes
[1:03:42] on in the Adam's home.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Nor do we understand what goes on in
[1:03:46] your home.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; The things that you're going through.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; OH, IT APPEARS that everything's great
[1:03:53] and everything is great.
[1:03:58] All right, WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT
[1:03:59] CLAIMER DISCLAIMER OUT THERE.
[1:04:00] EVERYTHING'S GREAT.
[1:04:03] But notice notice when things are great,
[1:04:07] we don't really consecrate our lives the
[1:04:10] way we should.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; You know, we leave we leave it all for
[1:04:14] the preachers.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; We leave it all for the deacons and all
[1:04:17] for the church officials or for mom and
[1:04:19] dad or for, you know, others in the
[1:04:20] church to pull the load to say amen to
[1:04:23] the word of God.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WE FIND WHEN WE'RE FACING
[1:04:26] DIFFICULTIES IN THE HOME, we're
[1:04:28] struggling in this life and we seem TO
[1:04:31] FALLEN ON FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS, WE BEGIN
[1:04:34] TO PRAY MORE.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; WE BEGIN TO SEEK GOD MORE. WE BEGIN TO
[1:04:40] LISTEN MORE CUZ WHY? WE'RE LISTENING FOR
[1:04:42] THAT STILL SMALL VOICE TO BRING US
[1:04:45] THROUGH THAT TRIAL. SO YOU FIND THE
[1:04:47] DIFFICULTIES IN LIFE, THE HARDSHIPS THAT
[1:04:50] WE GO THROUGH BUILD STRONG CHRISTIANS.
[1:04:54] That's right.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever wonder why does troubles
[1:04:59] come?
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; WHY DOES TROUBLES COME? BROTHER M SAYS
[1:05:04] GOD HARNESSES TROUBLE, PUTS BITS IN ITS
[1:05:07] mouth and makes it obey him. AND THOSE
[1:05:10] TROUBLES, HEAR THIS NOW. THOSE TROUBLES
[1:05:12] BRING YOU into a closer fellowship with
[1:05:14] God.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Some of you been wondering, why am I in
[1:05:22] this valley? Why am I in this trial?
[1:05:24] God's just trying to draw close to you.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; HE GO THERE'S, HE GOES, THERE HAD BEEN
[1:05:28] NO RAINBOW until the flood came. BUT
[1:05:31] AFTER NOAH WAS PRESSED IN THAT CONDITION
[1:05:33] THAT HE WAS IN TO FLOAT 40 DAYS AND
[1:05:36] NIGHTS IN A STORM AND A LITTLE ARC
[1:05:38] PITCHING UP AND DOWN IN THE WATER, IT
[1:05:40] WAS AFTER THE FLOOD WAS OVER THAT HE SAW
[1:05:43] THE RAINBOW FOR THE FIRST TIME. A
[1:05:44] COVENANT.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; SEE, A COVENANT OF HOPE, A COVENANT OF
[1:05:48] PROMISE. IT WAS AFTER HE WENT THROUGH
[1:05:49] THE TRIBULATION, THEN HE saw the
[1:05:52] promise.
[1:05:53] AND WE FIND WE ASK FOR COMFORT AND
[1:05:55] PEACE.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU'VE ASKED FOR, "OH, JO
[1:06:00] LORD, JUST GIVE ME YOUR COMFORT. GIVE ME
[1:06:01] YOUR PEACE, GOD." AND GOD GIVES YOU THE
[1:06:04] BEST THAT HE CAN GIVE US. AND HE GIVES
[1:06:06] YOU TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS. HE GOES,
[1:06:08] "THAT'S WAY BETTER THAN COMFORT AND
[1:06:10] PEACE." OUR COMFORT IS JUST BEYOND the
[1:06:13] river.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, but when the truth is come out of,
[1:06:20] notice when they come out of
[1:06:22] Egypt there. God has a path for each of
[1:06:25] our lives.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; God knows where what he's doing, church.
[1:06:29] And you know, brother B will tell us in
[1:06:31] God's way that's been made for us. He
[1:06:33] said, "When the children of Israel come
[1:06:35] out of the land OF EGYPT, THEY FOLLOW
[1:06:37] GOD'S PATH. HE LED UP TO the Red Sea."
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; You know, some of you would be like,
[1:06:43] "Uh-uh, Moses, this is wrong.
[1:06:46] You must not be anointed.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; You must not be called." CUZ IF YOU WAS
[1:06:52] CALLED, YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN
[1:06:53] BRING us here.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe not all of you,
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; but some of you find that little reason
[1:07:01] to complain and argue and backbite.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; That's not when you say amen, brother L.
[1:07:10] [laughter]
[1:07:10] Love you, buddy.
[1:07:12] BUT NOTICE WHERE GOD'S PATH LEADS. SO
[1:07:15] GOD'S INFINITE GOD. HE KNOWS THE END
[1:07:17] FROM the beginning. He knows HOW LONG
[1:07:19] THEY WERE IN EGYPT. AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE
[1:07:21] WAS GOING TO DO TO TAKE THEM OUT. AND
[1:07:22] HERE HE SENDS HIM A PROPHET. NOTICE A
[1:07:25] PROPHET, A VINDICATED VOICE, AND LED
[1:07:28] THEM OUT AND BROUGHT THEM RIGHT TO THE
[1:07:30] RED SEA.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS GOD'S PATH, NOT AROUND THE
[1:07:35] SEA, NOT OVER THE SEA.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S PATH LED THROUGH THE SEA.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; And notice WHEN THEY CAME THROUGH THE
[1:07:44] SEA, GOD KEPT LEADING AND HE LED THEM TO
[1:07:47] BITTER WATERS, THE LANDS OF MARA. HE LED
[1:07:49] THEM THERE. SAYS, "WELL, GOD, IF GOD'S
[1:07:51] SO GREAT AND GOD'S SO WONDERFUL AND THIS
[1:07:54] CHRISTIAN LIFE IS IS SO SO ONE TO BE
[1:07:57] SOUGHT AFTER AND YOU KNOW, BEING A
[1:07:59] BELIEVER IS GREAT THING, THEN WHY ARE
[1:08:00] THERE RED SEAS? WHY ARE THERE BITTER
[1:08:03] WATERS?" BECAUSE GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S
[1:08:05] DOING IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; GOD'S PATH MAY LEAD YOU RIGHT TO CANCER.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; And maybe we find ourselves saying, "But
[1:08:17] God, I'm a child of God.
[1:08:19] I'm a believer. Why me? Why now?
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; But if you have a hiding place,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; you don't think about the why me
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; and the why now.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; See, just keep trusting God.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Just keep following the pillar of fire.
[1:08:40] God knows how to lead.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; See, he's proven that not even cancer
[1:08:46] will stand before the believer's prayer.
[1:08:49] And we got several cancer survivors
[1:08:51] right here in this congregation this
[1:08:53] morning.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, it was a red sea. It was a bitter
[1:08:56] water. But you made it.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; You made it. See, just remember, it's
[1:09:03] after the tribulation. It's after the
[1:09:05] trial that we see the promise.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; See, he has a hiding place for the
[1:09:11] believer.
[1:09:16] Brother man would tell us he says then
[1:09:18] he went right up to the wilderness into
[1:09:20] the spring of Mara the bitter water.
[1:09:22] Isn't it strange that God will lead his
[1:09:24] children through bitter waters but them
[1:09:27] all goes along the road but when he WAS
[1:09:29] THERE THE REMEDY FOR THE bitter waters
[1:09:31] was standing on the bank and Moses cut
[1:09:34] down a tree and throwed it into the
[1:09:35] bitter water and it turned sweet again.
[1:09:37] And maybe that's where you're at this
[1:09:39] morning.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've COME TO A RED Sea and you
[1:09:42] don't see any way to cross. Maybe you've
[1:09:44] come to bitter waters and you question
[1:09:46] yourself, why? Why red seas? Why all the
[1:09:49] difficulty? If I didn't have bad luck, I
[1:09:52] wouldn't have any luck.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Man,
[1:09:59] see, things are not going as you had
[1:10:00] hoped. You're dealing with sickness,
[1:10:02] maybe an unfavorable doctor's report.
[1:10:04] You falling on hard times, struggling to
[1:10:06] stay one step ahead of your bills.
[1:10:09] But can I tell you the thing that you're
[1:10:12] needing for the bitter waters is just on
[1:10:14] the other side.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus is there waiting for somebody to
[1:10:20] take them and put them into their bitter
[1:10:21] waters
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; for [snorts] them to turn sweet again.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Brother tells me, he goes, "Now that's
[1:10:26] the way God leads his children GOD'S
[1:10:28] PATH. GOD'S PROVIDE a way. If the
[1:10:30] children of ISRAEL WOULD HAVE TRIED TO
[1:10:32] BYPASS AND GO AROUND down this way, they
[1:10:35] would have got IN TROUBLE. SEE, THEY HAD
[1:10:37] TO FOLLOW THE CLOUD OF PILL OF FIRE.
[1:10:39] THEY had to follow the pillar of fire
[1:10:40] that led them. THEY FOLLOWED THAT. AND
[1:10:42] IF he goes, "And if the CHURCH TONIGHT
[1:10:44] WILL ONLY FOLLOW THE PILLAR OF FIRE, THE
[1:10:47] HOLY SPIRIT, YOU'LL MAKE CANAAN as sure
[1:10:49] as anything."
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; And that's our goal church is to MAKE
[1:10:52] CANAAN. BUT WE FIND TODAY many are
[1:10:55] following a man.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; They listen to a headquarters to give
[1:10:59] them marching orders, certain time to
[1:11:02] play a tape or to do this or to do that.
[1:11:05] Many are following the system of a man.
[1:11:08] [snorts]
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; You know, they they attached theirel to
[1:11:10] a gift
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; and they seek after signs and wonders
[1:11:14] versus seeking after the giver of the
[1:11:16] gift.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; See, God sent us the pillar of fire in
[1:11:19] this day to lead us to the promised
[1:11:21] land. And when Moses went off the scene,
[1:11:24] God had a Joshua prepared.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And he TOLD JOSHUA, "AS I was with
[1:11:29] Moses, so shall I be with you."
[1:11:32] Just because Moses went off the scene
[1:11:34] did not mean God went off the scene.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And just because a prophet goes off the
[1:11:38] scene doesn't mean the spirit of God is
[1:11:40] off the scene. He's still here. He's
[1:11:42] still present.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; SO WE FIND HERE GOD HAD A JOSHUA PRAYER
[1:11:46] TO TAKE the people into the land. IT
[1:11:47] WASN'T ABOUT THE MAN, BUT IT WAS ABOUT
[1:11:49] the leading of the Holy Spirit church.
[1:11:52] AND I'M GRATEFUL AND I'LL SAY THIS. I'M
[1:11:54] VERY GRATEFUL FOR FAITHFUL men who has
[1:11:55] stood FOR THE MESSAGE. MEN WHO HAVE
[1:11:57] GALLERY PROCLAIMED THE TRUTH OF THE
[1:11:59] MESSAGE. MEN THAT HAS BLAZED A TRAIL FOR
[1:12:01] US TODAY TO BE ABLE TO PREACH THE
[1:12:03] INFALLIBLE TRUTHS OF THE MESSAGE. BUT
[1:12:05] OUR SAFETY DOESN'T REST IN WHO OUR
[1:12:07] PASTOR IS. OUR SAFETY DOESN'T REST IN
[1:12:09] WHAT CHURCH WE ATTEND. OUR SAFETY REST
[1:12:12] IN THE WORD OF GOD. IT'S ANOINTED FOR
[1:12:14] THIS HOUR TO TRANSFORM A PEOPLE TO TAKE
[1:12:17] YOU OUT AND TO TAKE YOU IN TO THE LAND
[1:12:20] THAT'S BLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; SO DON'T GET YOUR EYES FOCUSED ON SOME
[1:12:24] SOME IDEA OR SOME MAN OR SOME
[1:12:27] PERSONALITY. PUT YOUR FOCUS ON THE WORD
[1:12:30] OF GOD.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said, "NOW LET ME MAKE
[1:12:34] THIS CLEAR. LET THE HE GOES, I WANT TO
[1:12:36] LET THIS CLEARLY BE MAKE THIS KNOWN. I
[1:12:38] AM NOT THAT PERSON. I AM THE SERVANT TO
[1:12:41] THAT PERSON."
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; You say, "Bro, why do you bring these
[1:12:47] things out? We know better." That's
[1:12:48] that's not a problem here at Even Like
[1:12:51] Tabernacle. You're exactly right. But
[1:12:52] it's a problem other places.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Trust me, I go to California enough.
[1:12:57] THERE'S PROBLEMS AND WE FIND LISTEN TO
[1:13:00] WHAT HE SAYS. I'M A SERVANT TO THAT
[1:13:02] PERSON AND YOU ARE TOO IF YOU'RE
[1:13:03] ABRAHAM'S SEED. THEN HE GOES INTO THE
[1:13:06] THE church age and CHURCH A HE GOES I
[1:13:08] WANT TO MAKE ONE MORE COMPARISON BETWEEN
[1:13:10] A LEODYIAN prophet messenger AND JOHN
[1:13:13] THE PROPHET MESSENGER WHO PRECEDED JESUS
[1:13:15] FIRST COMING. HE SAID THE PEOPLE IN
[1:13:18] JOHN'S DAY MISTOOK HIM FOR THE MESSIAH.
[1:13:20] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; THEN HE SAYS, "NOW THIS LAST DAY PROPHET
[1:13:25] MESSENGER WILL HAVE SUCH POWER BEFORE
[1:13:27] THE LORD THAT THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO
[1:13:29] MISTAKE HIM FOR THE LORD JESUS."
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE A SPIRIT, LISTEN, there
[1:13:35] will BE A SPIRIT IN THE WORLD AT THE END
[1:13:37] TIME THAT WILL SEDUCE SOME AND MAKE them
[1:13:40] believe this.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; SO YOU WONDER HOW CAN THEY believe such
[1:13:45] nonsense?
[1:13:47] Because there's a spirit in the world.
[1:13:50] that seduces them to believe this.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham keeps going. HE
[1:13:56] SAYS, "BUT DON'T you believe it? He is
[1:13:59] not Jesus Christ. He is not the son of
[1:14:02] God. HE IS ONE of the brethren, a
[1:14:04] prophet, a messenger, a servant of God.
[1:14:06] He needs NO GREATER HONOR BESTOWED UPON
[1:14:09] HIM THAN THAT WHICH JOHN RECEIVED WHEN
[1:14:12] HE was the VOICE THAT CRIED, "I AM NOT
[1:14:14] HE, BUT he is coming after me." Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; AND FOR MANY, BROTHER BRANDHAM HAS
[1:14:19] become their absolute.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; He and he alone is their place of
[1:14:24] safety. He is their hiding place.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Many believe that if YOU BELIEVE GOD
[1:14:29] SENT A PROPHET AND YOU got the Holy
[1:14:31] Ghost, you're going to make a rapture.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Others are baptizing IN HIS NAME,
[1:14:35] PRAYING his name, even some to believe
[1:14:37] him to be Christ Branom.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; But notice he said there would be a
[1:14:43] spirit in the land.
[1:14:47] So can I tell you church this morning
[1:14:50] that William Brandham is not our hiding
[1:14:52] place and I mean that with all reverence
[1:14:54] and respect.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; The name William Brandom, the man
[1:14:58] William Brandom, the person William
[1:15:01] Brandham is not our hiding place.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; But our hiding place is in the one he
[1:15:07] pointed us to.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; SEE, BROTHER BRANDHAM NEVER POINTED TO
[1:15:12] HIMSELF. RATHER, HE ALWAYS POINTED the
[1:15:15] believer to Christ.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not the person. I'm only the servant
[1:15:21] of that person.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; And that should make us each and
[1:15:24] everyone here today and on the live
[1:15:26] stream. That should make us thankful for
[1:15:28] a balanced ministry.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; One that can rightly divide the word.
[1:15:33] one that can rightly place the messenger
[1:15:36] and his message
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; and you
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; can rightly place us where we need to
[1:15:42] be.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; BUT MANY TIMES WHEN WE'RE GOING through
[1:15:46] difficulties, we think that our burdens,
[1:15:49] nobody else, oh my, nobody else has my
[1:15:53] burdens,
[1:15:54] man. Man, if everybody knew what I was
[1:15:57] going through, everybody be they'd be
[1:15:59] throwing palm trees down, palm branches.
[1:16:02] Here he comes. Man, I can't believe he's
[1:16:05] here. Look what he's been through. AND
[1:16:07] THAT'S HOW WE FEEL SOMETIMES. THAT'S HOW
[1:16:08] THE DEVIL WILL ROB YOU OF VICTORY TO
[1:16:10] MAKE YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; NOTICE I HE GOES, "BROTHER MAN SAYS, I
[1:16:18] MIGHT INJECT THIS HERE. WE THINK OUR
[1:16:19] BURDENS ARE SO HEAVY SOMETIMES THAT
[1:16:21] THERE'S NOTHING LIKE it in the world."
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW THAT ALL THESE things are
[1:16:27] good for you?
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. None of us like to hear that, do
[1:16:31] we?
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me that's good?
[1:16:36] God must have a sick sense of humor.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; BUT LISTEN, THEY ALL ARE TO MOLD YOU AND
[1:16:43] TO MAKE YOU.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; And some of US ARE JUST SLOW LEARNERS.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; We just keep going and going and going
[1:16:51] and going through the trial and seem
[1:16:52] like we we get a little we're out of it
[1:16:54] and all of a sudden we're right BACK IN
[1:16:55] IT. LOOK, WISE UP, PASS THE TEST. YEAH,
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; I remember when I first came to the
[1:17:01] message and they told me, you know, I
[1:17:02] heard brother Bam say, "You're going to
[1:17:04] keep going through that until you pass
[1:17:05] the test." I'm like, "Man, I am a
[1:17:07] miserable wretch. I am failing this test
[1:17:09] over and over and over." And I got
[1:17:11] rebuked after rebuke after rebuke after
[1:17:13] rebuke after rebuke. BUT EVENTUALLY, YOU
[1:17:16] WISE UP, BROTHER DEREK, AND YOU LEARN TO
[1:17:18] PASS THE TEST. YOU LEARN TO TRUST GOD.
[1:17:21] YOU LEARN TO DIE OUT TO SELF AND
[1:17:23] SELF-WILL AND FOLLOW THE LORD AND HIS
[1:17:25] LEADING. BUT WE FIND GOD BRINGS YOU
[1:17:28] THROUGH THESE THINGS TO MOLD YOU AND TO
[1:17:30] MAKE YOU. AND HE SAYS PROPHETS AND
[1:17:32] SAGES, THEY WERE MOLDED ON THE BACKSIDE
[1:17:34] OF THE DESERT IN THE HOT BLAZING SUN
[1:17:37] THROUGH TRIBULATIONS AND TRIALS AND
[1:17:39] PERSECUTIONS.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; AND THESE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TODAY,
[1:17:43] THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENED TO US THAT
[1:17:44] HASN'T happened to OTHER CHRISTIANS.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; WHEN'S THE LAST TIME SOME OF YOU WERE
[1:17:48] THROWN INTO A DEN OF LINES?
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; WHEN'S THE LAST TIME SOME OF YOU WERE
[1:17:52] PUT IN A COLISEUM?
[1:17:56] OH, BUT IT'S HAPPENED TO YOUR BROTHERS.
[1:17:58] IT'S HAPPENED TO YOUR SISTERS. AND YOU
[1:18:00] THINK, "OH, I'VE JUST I'M FINANCIALLY
[1:18:02] UNFIT.
[1:18:04] MY WORLD'S FALLING APART. THERE'S NOT
[1:18:07] GOING TO BE A TOMORROW."
[1:18:10] That's how the devil makes us feel.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER BAM SAYS HE KNOWS WHAT IT
[1:18:15] TAKES to mold you.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES TO MOLD YOU.
[1:18:21] Some of it sickness for some of us. Some
[1:18:25] of us financial, some of us are
[1:18:27] children, some of us it's just life in
[1:18:30] general.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; BUT SEE, GOD KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES TO MOLD
[1:18:35] YOU. HE KNOWS WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL THAT
[1:18:38] HE'S GOING TO USE.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; SEE, the backside of the desert
[1:18:43] sometimes is WHERE GOD MOLDS RIGHTEOUS
[1:18:45] MEN AND THE SAGES AND PROPHETS. THAT'S
[1:18:47] WHERE MEN ARE BEAT OUT. MEN ARE BEAT OUT
[1:18:50] IN THE WORD
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY GOT ALL KIND OF CREED AND
[1:18:54] STUFF IN THEM. LET THEM come to the word
[1:18:56] and God beats it right UP AND MOLDS IT
[1:18:58] RIGHT THIS RIGHT INTO THIS. IT'S A GREAT
[1:19:01] SYMPHONY. Listen how a prophet begins to
[1:19:03] use the word here. IT'S A GREAT SYMPHONY
[1:19:06] WITH of his word.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; See a symphony as we all know is a large
[1:19:11] scale musical composition typically of
[1:19:13] an orchestra and it's divided in to
[1:19:15] several movements. It term the term
[1:19:18] symphony here originated from the Greek
[1:19:20] word here and it means to sound
[1:19:22] together.
[1:19:24] SO, THERE'S SEVERAL of us here this
[1:19:26] morning, and maybe this group has the
[1:19:29] high hats, the symbols, and this group
[1:19:31] has the lows, and this group has
[1:19:33] something else, cuz I'm not a orchestra
[1:19:35] guy, and this GROUP HAS SOMETHING ELSE.
[1:19:37] BUT WE'RE ALL MUST [screaming] SOUND
[1:19:39] TOGETHER TO HAVE CHURCH, RIGHT?
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; THEN WE RECOGNIZE IN A A SYMPHONY,
[1:19:45] THERE'S TIMES IN THE THE THE TELLING OF
[1:19:48] THE STORY BECAUSE THE CONDUCTOR TELLS
[1:19:50] THE STORY THROUGH SONG.
[1:19:53] THEN THERE'S DRAMA.
[1:19:55] The low base is hitting and everybody's
[1:19:58] on the edge of their seat.
[1:20:01] [laughter]
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Then there's THE HIGH
[1:20:06] EVERYTHING GETS HIGH PITCHED EXCITEMENT
[1:20:08] AND ZEAL AND EVERYTHING. THEN THERE'S
[1:20:10] OTHER THINGS ARE BEING PLAYED OUT. SEE,
[1:20:12] BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT GOD KNOWS HOW TO
[1:20:15] CHANGE JUST THE RHYTHM OF THE MUSIC.
[1:20:18] AMEN.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; SEE, THERE'S TIMES IN OUR LIFE THAT WE
[1:20:20] HAVE DRAMATIC SEASONS AND THE MUSIC
[1:20:23] CHANGES BECAUSE MAYBE WE'RE GOING ONE
[1:20:25] WAY THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE GOING. SO GOD
[1:20:27] ALLOWS [screaming]
[1:20:28] THE BASE TO TREMBLE AND THE THINGS TO
[1:20:30] GET ROUGH AND THE LIFE TO GET HARD AND
[1:20:32] DIFFICULT. WHY? BUT CHANGE THE RHYTHM OF
[1:20:35] THE MUSIC TO BRING YOU IN SYNC WITH THE
[1:20:37] ORCHESTRA AGAIN.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; God knows how to change the rhythm.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; He's the conductor of our lives.
[1:20:49] Maybe you're, "Oh, well, I'm going to do
[1:20:50] it my way.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; You and Frank Sinatra don't agree
[1:20:55] together.
[1:20:56] [panting]
[1:20:57] We're going to do it my way." God knows
[1:21:00] how to pull the rug out from underneath
[1:21:02] you, Frank.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; And so, you'll do it his way.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; And you realize the rhythm of the music
[1:21:10] changes.
[1:21:12] But it all must be played together.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why we come to
[1:21:16] a service
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; because some of us are in those low
[1:21:21] times
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; and some of you are in those high times.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; And it takes those that are in those
[1:21:27] high times to help bring those in that
[1:21:28] low time back up
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; to realize WE'VE BEEN THERE. WE'VE COME
[1:21:32] THROUGH THE LOW TIMES. NOW WE'RE ON THE
[1:21:34] HIGH SOUNDS OF THE RHYTHM of the
[1:21:37] conductor.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; If we made it, you can make it, too.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; BUT I LIKE HOW THE PROPHET WOULD BEGIN
[1:21:43] TO USE THAT. HE KNOWS WHEN THE RHYTHM OF
[1:21:46] IT HAS to change.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; See, it's his story.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; He's only telling it through your lives.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; He will allow sickness to come
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; to get you back in sync.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; He will allow financial hardships to
[1:22:02] come to get you back in sync.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; He will allow your kids to go astray
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; to bring you back in sync.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; He knows the rhythm of the music.
[1:22:14] Only thing he asks of us
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; is when he's when you need to respond.
[1:22:22] Maybe it's only for one second.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe you only have one moment in the
[1:22:27] entire program, but when it comes your
[1:22:31] moment, make sure you're ready.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Make sure that you're ready.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; He says, "Many are the afflictions of
[1:22:39] THE RIGHTEOUS, BUT GOD DELIVERTH HIM OUT
[1:22:41] OF THEM ALL. GOD HAS moved through
[1:22:43] history with the rhythm of the promise
[1:22:45] of his word in each age in the same
[1:22:47] rhythm making his word. He says that's
[1:22:50] how God moved down THROUGH HISTORY FROM
[1:22:52] ALL THE WAY FROM GENESIS TO REVELATION.
[1:22:54] He moved through HISTORY WITH THE WORD.
[1:22:56] THAT'S RIGHT. THE RHYTHM OF THE POWER OF
[1:22:58] THE HOLY SPIRIT vindicating his word to
[1:23:00] the elect.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Remember, he's never been able to touch
[1:23:04] the outside church. It's only the
[1:23:07] elected.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Only the elected. And you look at some
[1:23:11] people and you ask, "How in the world
[1:23:15] are they gonna make it?"
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Don't act like you ain't never thought
[1:23:20] that.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; How in the world is they going to make
[1:23:25] it,
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; man? Look what they have done. They have
[1:23:30] destroyed that family. They have ruined
[1:23:32] their testimony. How in the world? But
[1:23:35] God knows.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; God knows. He's the one standing behind
[1:23:40] here.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; He knows
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; how to bring it out.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; There's those that are here this
[1:23:50] morning.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Many of us would have gave up on a long
[1:23:53] time. Actually, some of us probably did
[1:23:55] give up,
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; but you're here
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; because God is still conducting
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; the music.
[1:24:04] God is still can. He's trying to show
[1:24:06] you you have a hiding place. It's not
[1:24:09] out there in the world. It's not out
[1:24:11] there in systems of man.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; But notice, I love how brother Rama said
[1:24:15] it wasn't until the Hebrew children were
[1:24:17] forced to go into the fiery furnace. One
[1:24:20] of their most outstanding trials that
[1:24:23] the son of man appeared on the scene.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Well, do you want the son of man?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Then you got to welcome the trial.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. There's no son of man
[1:24:34] without the trial.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Then he goes in, he says, notice, he
[1:24:38] says, Daniel, he had purpose in his
[1:24:40] HEART THAT HE WOULD NOT DEFILE HIMSELF
[1:24:42] WITH THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. AND HE was
[1:24:44] forced TO A TRIAL. NOTICE, HE KNEW THAT
[1:24:46] THE LAW WAS levied against him. He
[1:24:49] didn't run to Virginia.
[1:24:52] He didn't find another pastor to sit
[1:24:54] under.
[1:24:55] No, he just simply went home, brother
[1:24:57] Derek, and he bowed on his knees and he
[1:24:59] prayed three times a day as was his
[1:25:02] custom.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; He continued they uh Daniel had a hiding
[1:25:07] place, a refuge.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't care what they did. He knew
[1:25:13] what the consequences of that trial was.
[1:25:17] BUT WE FIND when he was thrown into the
[1:25:20] trial that the angel of the Lord came in
[1:25:24] and stood between him and the lions. SO
[1:25:27] IT WAS AFTER THE TEST. IT'S AFTER THE
[1:25:29] TRIAL DOES THE ANGEL OF THE Lord appear.
[1:25:33] THEN WE GO INTO ABRAHAM AND WE know the
[1:25:35] story of Abraham. He was on the back
[1:25:36] side of the desert. He gave Lot the
[1:25:39] CHOICE OF THE BEST LAND. AND HERE
[1:25:41] Abraham is he's he's been holding on to
[1:25:44] a promise for years. HE'S OUT THERE ON
[1:25:46] THE BEARING GROUND. Drought has come and
[1:25:48] know what? He's got a nagging wife over
[1:25:50] here and nothing seems to be going his
[1:25:52] way. Come on, somebody.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Everything seems to be falling apart.
[1:25:58] But Abraham kept believing. BUT NOTICE
[1:26:00] IT WAS AFTER THE TRIAL WAS OVER THAT HE
[1:26:02] SPOKE FACE TO FACE WITH ELOHIM.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't speak TO SOME LITTLE ANGEL. HE
[1:26:08] DIDN'T SPEAK TO SOMEBODY ELSE. HE WASN'T
[1:26:10] JUST SPEAKING TO SOME MAN. HE SPOKE HE
[1:26:12] SPOKE FACE TO FACE WITH ELOHIM. SEE, IT
[1:26:15] WAS AFTER THE TRIAL. IT WAS AFTER HE
[1:26:17] ENDURED, AFTER HE WENT THROUGH THE
[1:26:19] TROUBLES, AFTER THE DROUGHT, AFTER THE
[1:26:21] BEARING LAND, AFTER ALL THIS DID HE
[1:26:23] FINALLY SEE GOD.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And we find there's a pattern.
[1:26:30] Don't look at your trial. Don't focus on
[1:26:33] your tribulation,
[1:26:35] but look for the promise after the
[1:26:38] trial.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:26:41] Look for the one that's supposed to
[1:26:43] appear after the tribulation.
[1:26:48] See, look for the promise that's just
[1:26:51] beyond the valley.
[1:26:54] See, it's after the trial, after you
[1:26:56] overcome that the Lord draws nigh and he
[1:26:58] becomes that fourth man in the furnace.
[1:27:00] It's after the test that the angel of
[1:27:02] the Lord appears. It's after the test
[1:27:05] that you can talk face to face with
[1:27:08] Elohim. It was after the battle that
[1:27:12] Melzdc
[1:27:13] appeared to Abraham
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; after after after.
[1:27:20] But each in these situations,
[1:27:23] those three Hebrew boys, they had a
[1:27:25] hiding place.
[1:27:28] Without the Holy Ghost, they had an
[1:27:29] experience. Daniel had a hiding place.
[1:27:32] Without the Holy Ghost, he had an
[1:27:34] experience. Abraham
[1:27:38] listening to a voice and yet he held on
[1:27:40] for 25 years.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; But I love how David would tell us here,
[1:27:46] "Thou art my hiding place." And this
[1:27:49] gives illusion to the cities of refuge
[1:27:51] that we find in numbers 35 and:9 says
[1:27:53] the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak
[1:27:56] unto the children of Israel and say unto
[1:27:58] them when you come over Jordan into this
[1:28:00] land of Canaan then you shall appoint
[1:28:02] you cities to be cities of refuge for
[1:28:05] you that the slayer may flee thither
[1:28:07] which kleth any person's unawares and
[1:28:10] they notice and they shall be unto you
[1:28:12] cities of refuge from the avenger that
[1:28:15] the man's slayer die not until the till
[1:28:18] stand before the congregation in
[1:28:20] judgment. So in THE OLD TESTAMENT WHEN A
[1:28:22] MAN HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG NOW IT WAS
[1:28:24] TOOTH FOR TOOTH AND EYE FOR EYE BUT WE
[1:28:27] FIND IF HE' DONE SOMETHING WRONG AND AND
[1:28:29] HE didn't mean to do it he murdered a
[1:28:31] man IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT HE HAD A
[1:28:33] PLACE OF ESCAPE HE HAD A A REFUGE A CITY
[1:28:36] THAT HE COULD RUN TO AND AS LONG AS HE
[1:28:38] GOT THERE BEFORE THE PERSECUTORS OR THE
[1:28:39] PURSUERS GOT TO HIM HE WAS PROTECTED AND
[1:28:42] THE PERS THE THE PURSUERS COULDN'T COME
[1:28:44] INTO that city
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; and brother B would tell us like this he
[1:28:48] says NOW BUT IF HE GOT THERE. AND IF HE
[1:28:51] DID THE CRIME NOT WILLINGLY, HE COULD
[1:28:53] PLEAD HIS CASE AND SHOW THAT HE WAS
[1:28:55] SORRY THAT HE DID IT, HE COULD BE
[1:28:57] BROUGHT INTO THE CITY OF REFUGE AND THE
[1:28:59] pursuers could not enter into that city.
[1:29:02] He was safe. What a feeling it must have
[1:29:04] been to know that you did something that
[1:29:06] was wrong.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; To know that you did something that was
[1:29:12] wrong.
[1:29:15] But there was a place where you could
[1:29:17] that you could go and have no worry no
[1:29:19] more.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Go into that place and are safe. And if
[1:29:23] a man willingly did it, then he couldn't
[1:29:25] come in. But see, he goes, I like to
[1:29:27] give it a type. If a man had done wrong
[1:29:29] and he he really wants he HE WAS REALLY
[1:29:32] SORRY FOR THAT HE SINNED AND THERE WAS A
[1:29:34] PLACE OF REFUGE. And he goes, "AND IF HE
[1:29:36] JUST DON'T CARE, then there's no place
[1:29:38] for him
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; cuz he won't accept it. He's done mean.
[1:29:43] He wanted to and no chance for him.
[1:29:45] That's the same as it is today. But if
[1:29:47] HE HAD DONE WRONG, he must want a place
[1:29:49] of refuge.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; He must want a place of refuge.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; He must recognize he needs a place of
[1:29:59] safety.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram says that's a very good
[1:30:02] type of the church and the people. A man
[1:30:05] has got to want a place of refuge.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; You got to feel your need of it. But if
[1:30:11] you think you want to fight your own
[1:30:14] battles,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; oh, come on now.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna do it my way.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; I'm my own person.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll do it my way. But if YOU DON'T
[1:30:26] WANT TO FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLES, LISTEN
[1:30:27] WHAT HE SAYS NOW. YOU WANT TO FIGHT YOUR
[1:30:29] OWN BATTLES, HE GOES, GO AHEAD, BUT
[1:30:31] YOU'LL surely be caught by the pursuers.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; But someday it's going to find you. But
[1:30:35] if you want a place, HE SAID, "THEN WHEN
[1:30:37] A MAN WANTS A PLACE AND HE FOUND A
[1:30:39] PLACE, HE MUST BE WILLING TO STAY THERE.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GO OUT NO MORE. YOU STAY
[1:30:44] THERE. YOU'RE SAFE WHILE YOU'RE THERE."
[1:30:46] HE GOES, "OH, WHAT A RELIEF IT MUST HAVE
[1:30:48] BEEN TO FIND THAT PLACE. AS SOON AS YOU
[1:30:50] ENTER INTO THE GATES, THE GATES CLOSE
[1:30:52] BEHIND YOU AND YOU'LL BE SATISFIED." HE
[1:30:55] MUST WANT TO STAY THERE. NO COMPLAINING.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Well, if I was the pastor,
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; I would do it this way. If I was this
[1:31:05] and if I was a deacon, I'll tell you
[1:31:07] what I would do. I would do. But you
[1:31:08] ain't the deacon and know are you the
[1:31:10] pastor.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; He start complaining and complaining and
[1:31:15] complaining. Well, if I was if I WAS
[1:31:18] OVER THE SOUND, I take that big old bass
[1:31:20] out of here cuz that thing just makes me
[1:31:22] go crazy.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; I would turn the music down. I'd do this
[1:31:25] and I do this and I I I [laughter] I
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, ARE YOU IN A PLACE OF SAFETY? Come
[1:31:32] on.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT PLACE, THERE'S NO
[1:31:35] COMPLAINING.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Got to be careful here, right? Cuz we
[1:31:41] all have feelings.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; And I don't mean to be stepping on
[1:31:44] anybody's toes and their feelings.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; But look what we got.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Look what we have.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Go to some of the places I go.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; God bless them. They doing everything
[1:32:00] they can to provide an atmosphere.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And we have A WONDERFUL PRESENCE, A
[1:32:07] WONDERFUL BUILDING, GREAT INSTRUMENTS,
[1:32:10] AND GREAT MUSICIANS AND GREAT PEOPLE TO
[1:32:13] WORK THESE MUSICIANS. AND SOME OF US CAN
[1:32:15] FIND NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT COMPLAIN.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; You are in a city under a wonderful
[1:32:27] ministry.
[1:32:30] Well, the presence of God flows service
[1:32:32] after service.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; But you must recognize you want to be
[1:32:37] here.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying even like tabernacles
[1:32:41] you're hiding place. So, let me go ahead
[1:32:43] and clear the air on that.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to bring a tight to you.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; You should be thankful, grateful,
[1:32:51] appreciative
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; for the facility that we have, the
[1:32:55] ministry that we have. Not just ministry
[1:32:58] of preaching, BUT THE MINISTRY OF SONGS
[1:33:00] AND singers and musicians and
[1:33:02] everything. THE MINISTRY OF YOURSELF
[1:33:04] BEING THE BRIDE.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful group of people that we
[1:33:10] get to fellowship with and rub shoulders
[1:33:12] with and encourage one another day in
[1:33:14] and day out.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; BUT NO COMPLAINING. WALK AROUND SAY,
[1:33:20] "WHY? Why did I ever come here?
[1:33:26] I cannot believe it. I moved all the way
[1:33:29] from so and so and so and so
[1:33:32] why did I do it?
[1:33:38] I got to do this and they want me TO DO
[1:33:40] THIS AND WE NEVER DID THIS in my other
[1:33:42] church
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; tight this morning. Loosen up.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; WE NEVER HAD TO DO THIS. I'VE BEEN IN
[1:33:55] THE MESSAGE 50 YEARS.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T DO IT LIKE THAT when I was
[1:34:00] young. Well, I mean, come on. The
[1:34:03] ministry's evolved.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; The ministry's grown.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; The ministry's changed.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; So, you're telling me you didn't change?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; You telling me you didn't evolve?
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Telling me YOU DIDN'T GROW.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; OH, I GOT TO GO. ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS
[1:34:20] PASS THAT PLATE.
[1:34:25] I MEAN, MAN, THEY PASS THAT PLATE AND
[1:34:27] PASS THAT PLATE and they'll sit there
[1:34:29] and stare at you.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Just for the record, we had Vinmo today.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; So, y'all don't be casting judgment on
[1:34:40] those people ain't putting nothing in
[1:34:41] the plate. There's Vinmo, there's Zel,
[1:34:43] there's Cash App. He gets his ties.
[1:34:46] Don't be looking and judging people. I
[1:34:49] just want to clear the air on that one.
[1:34:53] BUT WE COMPLAIN. LOOK CHURCH, WE HAVE
[1:34:55] NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. GOD HAS
[1:34:57] PROVIDED everything we have need of.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD BE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE IN ALL
[1:35:06] OF LOUISIANA.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE MUCH IN THIS STATE.
[1:35:10] IT'S AN UGLY STATE. IT'S A WRETCHED
[1:35:12] STATE. BUT WE GOT THE WORD. WE GOT A
[1:35:15] MINISTRY. WE GOT A PEOPLE. WE GOT A
[1:35:18] HIDING PLACE. [applause]
[1:35:21] OH, I'M TELLING YOU, WE SHOULD BE THE
[1:35:24] MOST HAPPY PEOPLE. THERE'S NOTHING TO
[1:35:26] COMPLAIN ABOUT.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "Oh,"
[1:35:34] he goes, "When I when I came into that
[1:35:35] hiding place, it's like heaven to me."
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Just remember, how about you reflect
[1:35:42] back?
[1:35:43] It do us good if you can think back that
[1:35:45] far. Some of you reflect back on it when
[1:35:49] you surrendered your life to God.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; When the reality of Jesus Christ became
[1:35:57] more than just a name on a Bible or a
[1:35:59] book
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; or name that was in print or a story
[1:36:03] that you heard growing up in Sunday
[1:36:04] school, but it became a life.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; I can tell you I never never never
[1:36:12] forget about the night I gave my heart
[1:36:15] to the Lord.
[1:36:16] the greatest moment of my life.
[1:36:20] I've been through some hard times just
[1:36:22] like some of you.
[1:36:24] But you know, it's during those hard
[1:36:26] times you have to learn to worship God
[1:36:27] anyway.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; It's during those hard times. It's not
[1:36:31] easy. Go ahead. I'm going to go ahead
[1:36:32] and say it's not easy to worship when
[1:36:34] you're in a trial.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, the rewards
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; for worshiping during a trial are
[1:36:41] outstanding. Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Paul and Silas in a trial, thrown into a
[1:36:48] prison. All they were doing was
[1:36:50] preaching the message, preaching the
[1:36:51] gospel, DECLARING YOURSELF. BUT THEY
[1:36:53] didn't get behind there, BROTHER SAY,
[1:36:55] "OH, WHY? WHY ME, GOD? WHY'D YOU THROW
[1:36:57] ME IN PRISON? WHAT IS EVERYBODY GOING TO
[1:36:59] THINK ABOUT ME?" NO, THEY JUST BEGIN TO
[1:37:01] WORSHIP THE LORD IN THEIR TRIAL.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENED? THEIR WORSHIP CREATED
[1:37:07] AN EARTHQUAKE BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO
[1:37:09] RESOUND IN HEAVEN. AND GOD SHOOK THE
[1:37:12] PRISON CELL AND CAUSED EVERYONE TO WALK
[1:37:14] OUT AND BE FREE. LET ME TELL YOU, IF YOU
[1:37:17] CAN WORSHIP GOD TODAY IN THIS SERVICE,
[1:37:19] IN YOUR TRIAL, THROUGH YOUR TRIBULATION,
[1:37:22] ALL HELL WILL BE SHOOK TODAY. [applause]
[1:37:25] I SAY, HOUSE OF HELL, GIVE WAY TO THE
[1:37:28] NAME OF JESUS. GOD HAS GOT WORSHIPPERS
[1:37:30] HERE. [cheering] THEY'RE WORSHIPING
[1:37:32] THROUGH THEIR TRIAL. THEY HAVE A HIDING
[1:37:34] PLACE, AND IT'S THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:37:39] HE'S A place of safety, a place of rest.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "I'm inside of a tower and
[1:37:47] I have no desires to even look out."
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; When I gave my heart to God, and I know
[1:37:54] I tell this, but you know what? It's my
[1:37:55] story.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; I can't tell your story.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; I can tell mine. Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I may be able to give a testimony of
[1:38:04] your story, but I [sighs and gasps] know
[1:38:06] mine.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; I've never in 26 years of serving God in
[1:38:12] this message has never had a desire to
[1:38:14] go back to a bottle.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Never had a desire to go back to a
[1:38:17] party.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Never had a desire to go back to a bar.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Never. Never. Never. Why? Cuz I found a
[1:38:24] hiding place.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; I'm at home. I'm at rest. I don't have
[1:38:30] to seek anything else.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; My joys are full.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; We were just in Los Angeles last week
[1:38:38] and Brother Johnny, Brother Johnny
[1:38:40] Suarez asked me, he says, "Brother Joe,
[1:38:41] are you are you worried to be in
[1:38:43] California? Are you afraid to be here?
[1:38:46] You are in LA."
[1:38:50] I SAID, "BRO, THAT'S how we talk to each
[1:38:53] other." Bro, you know, it's short for
[1:38:56] brother. It's slang. Really?
[1:39:02] homie. No, I'm kidding.
[1:39:05] I said, BRO, I SAID, MY LIFE is hitting
[1:39:09] God through Christ.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; I don't care if this place sinks before
[1:39:13] IT GOES UNDER. I'M GOING UP.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. I GOT A HIDING
[1:39:18] PLACE. AND JESUS CHRIST IS MY HIDING
[1:39:20] PLACE. LET THE EARTHQUAKE COME. LET
[1:39:23] CALIFORNIA GO UNDER. I'M GOING
[1:39:25] [screaming] UP. WHY? BECAUSE I GOT A
[1:39:26] HIDING PLACE. I'M NOT AFRAID OF WHAT
[1:39:29] COMES. I'M NOT AFRAID OF WHAT SATAN CAN
[1:39:31] DO. I FOUND A REFUGE IN JESUS CHRIST.
[1:39:34] [applause]
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'RE SICK THIS MORNING, it's in
[1:39:39] the tower. There's healing.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER JOE, I'M WEARY. HE SAID,
[1:39:43] "CAST ALL YOUR CARES UPON ME, FOR I
[1:39:46] careth for you."
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; It's all in the tower. He said, "Death
[1:39:51] itself don't even worry you when you're
[1:39:54] in the Lord."
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:39:57] I know some of you getting old.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; You're worried about it. Don't worry.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Don't worry.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; One step out of this land.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; A new body.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; No more gray hair, Brother Tom.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Hair.
[1:40:15] [laughter]
[1:40:16] WOO. I MUST BE ON the other side.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to be 5'6. Please God, let
[1:40:23] me be 6 foot.
[1:40:27] I've been praying for six foot since I
[1:40:28] was in sixth grade.
[1:40:31] But I've been this tall that entire
[1:40:33] time.
[1:40:35] I look like a giant, Brother Derek, to
[1:40:37] the peeweees. But all of a sudden, we
[1:40:39] got the ninth grade. Whoop!
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; I'm looking up.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; But notice,
[1:40:48] your last breath here is your first
[1:40:50] breath there.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Death doesn't worry the
[1:40:55] believer
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; because you have a hiding place.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Go back to Psalms 32 and verse 7. We're
[1:41:01] going to
[1:41:05] I like how David says this. Thou art my
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; my
[1:41:14] I know you love me. We said I pray you
[1:41:17] do but it can't be thou art brother
[1:41:20] Joe's hiding place.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; It can't be that you're brother Tims or
[1:41:25] brother Timothy's or brother Aaron's but
[1:41:27] thou art mine.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; See David here was making it personal.
[1:41:35] Thou art my hiding place and thou shalt
[1:41:39] preserve me
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; from trouble. Thou shalt compass me
[1:41:44] about with songs of deliverance. SO
[1:41:47] DAVID HERE IS PUTTING PERSONAL CLAIMS ON
[1:41:49] God
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; and church when he becomes yours and not
[1:41:54] your parents.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; When he becomes yours and not the
[1:41:57] preachers, when he becomes yours and not
[1:41:59] the churches.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. No matter what you go through in
[1:42:03] life, you can smile. It may you can b
[1:42:05] grin and bear it, but you're going to
[1:42:07] get through it. Why? Because you have a
[1:42:09] hiding place.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; And remember, that's a word of safety,
[1:42:14] of rest, of peace.
[1:42:17] We find here the Bible tells us in 2
[1:42:20] Corinthians 4 and verse 7
[1:42:23] that we have this treasure
[1:42:26] in earthn vessels
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; that the excellency of the power may be
[1:42:32] of God and not of us. For we are
[1:42:34] troubled on every side yet not
[1:42:36] distressed.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; We are perplexed BUT NOT IN DESPAIR,
[1:42:41] PERSECUTED BUT NOT FORSAKEN, CAST DOWN
[1:42:43] BUT NOT DESTROYED. AND SO WE'RE
[1:42:46] TROUBLED, CHURCH. IT DOESN'T MEAN
[1:42:48] EVERYTHING'S GOING TO GO SMOOTH FOR YOU.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean that everything IS GOING TO
[1:42:53] BE GREAT. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL THE
[1:42:54] ANSWERS IN THIS LIFE. BUT WHAT IT DOES
[1:42:56] MEAN, THOUGH YOU'RE TROUBLED ON EVERY
[1:42:58] SIDE, WE HAVE A PLACE OF REST. WE HAVE A
[1:43:00] SAFETY. WE'RE NOT DISTRESSED. THOUGH WE
[1:43:02] WERE PERPLEXED AND WE DON'T KNOW WHICH
[1:43:03] WAY TO TURN, WE'LL NOT BE IN DESPAIR.
[1:43:05] THOUGH WE'RE PERSECUTED BY THE ENEMY, WE
[1:43:08] ARE NOT FORSAKEN BY GOD. AND THOUGH
[1:43:10] WE'VE BEEN CAST DOWN AND PUSHED ASIDE,
[1:43:13] WE ARE NOT DESTROYED. WE ARE STILL SONS
[1:43:16] AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD THIS MORNING.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here. Psalms 121:7
[1:43:24] said, "The Lord shall preserve thee from
[1:43:26] all evil, and he shall preserve thy
[1:43:29] soul." The Lord shall preserve thy going
[1:43:31] out and thy coming in from this time
[1:43:34] forth and ever more. at home or abroad,
[1:43:37] in the house, in the field, by the way,
[1:43:39] on the land or on the ocean, in their
[1:43:41] native COUNTRY, AND IN REMOTE LANDS, ON
[1:43:43] THE EARTH OR IN THE GRAVE. LOOK, he
[1:43:46] shall preserve you
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; going out, coming in forever more.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Then our favorite scripture,
[1:43:56] one of our favorite Psalms 27 and verse
[1:43:58] one.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; We're going to turn a corner and try to
[1:44:03] have you out of here. When that hand
[1:44:05] hits six,
[1:44:10] everybody's like, "Oh, good Lord, boy."
[1:44:15] Maybe sooner.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Psalms 27:1,
[1:44:20] "The Lord is my light."
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; That word there is illumination. Joy.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my joy. Some of y'all need
[1:44:35] to say that.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; He's my joy. I know some of you going
[1:44:43] through some hard time, but the Lord
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; is my light.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; He's my joy and my salvation. Whom shall
[1:44:52] I fear?
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; The Lord is the strength. That means a
[1:44:57] place, a safety, protection, refuge,
[1:44:59] stronghold of my life. In whom shall I
[1:45:02] be afraid?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Notice how David is taking this now.
[1:45:07] It's the Lord.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Thou art my hiding place.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "When the wicked, even my
[1:45:13] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[1:45:16] up or consume, devour, to slay my flesh,
[1:45:19] they stumbled
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; and fell.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Though a host should encamp against me."
[1:45:26] And that word host there, I had to look
[1:45:27] it up because I want to know. It's not A
[1:45:29] SINGLE NUMBER, BUT IT REPRESENTS A LARGE
[1:45:32] UNCOUNTABLE MULTITUDE. IT IT'S A TERM
[1:45:35] THAT EMPHASIZES A VAST OVERWHELMING
[1:45:37] number beyond human comprehension.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; SO THOUGH A HOE SHALL ENCAMP AGAINST ME,
[1:45:44] my heart shall not fear.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; THOUGH WAR SHALL RISE AGAINST ME, in
[1:45:50] this will I be competent. one thing,
[1:45:53] church.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; you don't need to be worried about a
[1:45:56] bunch of other little bitty things,
[1:45:57] little things on this side. What kind of
[1:45:59] car you're going to drive, who you're
[1:46:00] going to marry, what kind of house
[1:46:01] you're going to live in, what kind of
[1:46:02] job you're going to have, what kind of
[1:46:03] clothes you're going to wear. But one
[1:46:05] thing have I desired of the Lord, and
[1:46:08] that will I seek after that I
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; make it personal,
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; that I if there's only one believer
[1:46:16] going to be in Louisiana, I'm moving to
[1:46:18] Louisiana to be that believer. Amen.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Notice what HE SAYS HERE. ONE THING I'VE
[1:46:24] DESIRED, THE LORD, THAT WILL I SEEK
[1:46:25] AFTER THAT I MAY DWELL IN IT, TO MARRY,
[1:46:29] TO ABIDE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ALL
[1:46:32] THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, TO BEHOLD THE
[1:46:34] BEAUTY OF THE LORD, AND TO INQUIRE IN
[1:46:36] HIS TEMPLE. FOR IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE,
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; OH, THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME LIKE THIS
[1:46:43] TIME. THERE'S NEVER BEEN TROUBLE LIKE
[1:46:45] THE DAY THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. BUT HE
[1:46:46] GAVE A PROMISE TO US. IN THE TIME OF
[1:46:49] TROUBLE, HE SHALL HIDE ME
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; IN HIS PAVILION. IN THE SECRET OF HIS
[1:46:55] TABERNACLE SHALL HE HIDE ME. And he
[1:46:57] shall set me upon a rock.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; So let's break into this if we can and
[1:47:03] just kind of dissect it. In the time or
[1:47:06] the period or the seasons of trouble.
[1:47:10] Trouble being bad, disagreeable,
[1:47:12] malignant, unpleasant, evil, giving up
[1:47:14] pain, unhappy, and misery. So he's
[1:47:17] telling you in those times because we
[1:47:19] all go through those seasons
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; in those times he will hide me.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; He will cover me over.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Notice he will hide me in his pavilion.
[1:47:32] That word pavilion means dwelling. It
[1:47:33] means chamber. It's reference to the bed
[1:47:36] chamber.
[1:47:38] This is not the kitchen.
[1:47:41] This is not the living room. But it's in
[1:47:44] the bet chamber that he's going to hide
[1:47:46] you for an intimate relationship with
[1:47:50] his spouse.
[1:47:52] HE'S GOING TO HIDE YOU IN HIS PAVILION
[1:47:54] in the secret
[1:47:56] of his tabernacle,
[1:47:58] of his secret place. Not everybody's
[1:48:01] aware of it. Not everybody's welcomed
[1:48:03] in. It's only for an elect.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Then he will he shall set
[1:48:10] me upon a rock."
[1:48:12] What is a rock, brother Johnny? A
[1:48:14] revelation.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; A revelation.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; And when you get the revelation of the
[1:48:21] new birth,
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; there ain't nothing going to keep you
[1:48:25] from a rapture.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon would take this
[1:48:29] scripture, this passage, and he would
[1:48:31] preach the rapture message.
[1:48:34] See, because he was trying to get to
[1:48:36] believer to realize that the new birth
[1:48:38] is not just jumping. It's not just
[1:48:40] shouting. It's not just goosebumps. It's
[1:48:42] not just screaming, but he's going to
[1:48:44] set you on a rock. And no matter what
[1:48:47] you endure in this life, as long as you
[1:48:49] have that revelation that you've been
[1:48:51] born again by the spirit of God, no
[1:48:54] matter what, there's only one thing you
[1:48:55] desire, and that's to be in his
[1:48:57] presence.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; See, the true revelation of Jesus
[1:49:00] Christ, not he says, notice, nothing
[1:49:03] will keep you from the rapture. What a
[1:49:05] hiding place there is. No fear when the
[1:49:08] host comes against you. No fretting when
[1:49:10] war rises against you. But one thing
[1:49:12] that you desire and that you will seek
[1:49:15] after is a hiding place.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; And if you're abiding in Christ and
[1:49:20] Christ is abiding in you, then there's
[1:49:21] nothing that can harm you. You are
[1:49:23] protected. You have a place of safety.
[1:49:25] And can I tell you this message is the
[1:49:28] believer's hiding place.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; The message. And notice he says here in
[1:49:34] the rapture message, therefore the
[1:49:35] message caused the bride together.
[1:49:39] So what a hiding place to be married to
[1:49:41] the virtuous son of God that you've
[1:49:44] never sinned in the first place. And the
[1:49:46] first place was in the mind of God.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; God saw you.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Saw you perfect.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Saw you coming through difficulties. Saw
[1:49:54] you coming through valleys. And he says
[1:49:56] the rapture that we're talking about is
[1:49:58] only for the bride.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; See, if there's not a rapture, friends,
[1:50:04] then where are we?
[1:50:07] What are we going to? What age are we
[1:50:09] living in? What promise do we have?
[1:50:10] There's going to be a rapture. The Bible
[1:50:12] says that there will be and it will only
[1:50:14] be for the elected, the elected lady,
[1:50:16] the bride in this day that's poured out
[1:50:19] of the church.
[1:50:21] Now, we're going to turn a corner here
[1:50:22] and start moving this down to a where I
[1:50:24] really want to get to. See, they marched
[1:50:27] out of Egypt on the strength and the
[1:50:30] testimony of a prophet.
[1:50:34] When Israel left Egypt, they went on the
[1:50:37] testimony of Moses,
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; a vindicated prophet.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; They were following the pillar of fire
[1:50:46] because he was sent. And God proved that
[1:50:49] he was with Moses.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; But they didn't enter into the land
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; under Moses's ministry.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Now, follow me. this evening
[1:51:05] says as Moses called a nation out of a
[1:51:07] nation. He said the Holy Spirit is
[1:51:08] calling a bride out of a church or
[1:51:10] church out of a church members from
[1:51:12] every denomination making up the bride.
[1:51:14] THE BRIDE COMING OUT CALLED HE SAYS
[1:51:16] THAT'S THE ONE THE BRIDE rather is the
[1:51:18] one that's going to be in the rapture.
[1:51:20] THAT ALONE NOTHING BUT THE BRIDE THE
[1:51:22] ELECTED ONES FORNOWN OF GOD FROM THE
[1:51:24] BEGINNING. THE FATHER IS SPIRITUAL
[1:51:26] GENIUS. SO IF HE'S CALLING A BRIDE OUT
[1:51:28] OF A CHURCH THEN HE HAS to take this
[1:51:30] bride somewhere.
[1:51:32] or he's TAKEN US. HE CALLS YOU OUT TO
[1:51:35] BRING YOU IN. HE CALLED ISRAEL OUT OF
[1:51:37] EGYPT TO BRING THEM INTO THE LAND OF
[1:51:39] CANAAN. AND HE CALLS A BRIDE OUT OF DARK
[1:51:42] DENOMINATIONALISM TO BRING THEM INTO THE
[1:51:44] OPENING OF THE WORD. THAT IS THEIR
[1:51:46] HIDING PLACE.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; In Colossians 3 and:3, for you are dead
[1:51:52] and your life is hidden Christ in God.
[1:51:54] He goes, so notice now we're not called
[1:51:57] out of traditions of man to go back in
[1:51:59] traditions of man. That's right.
[1:52:02] But we're called out of
[1:52:04] denominationalism
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; to go into the promised land for the
[1:52:08] believer,
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; which is the opening of the word, which
[1:52:11] is the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam said there's three
[1:52:15] stages of the journey.
[1:52:18] Don't forget now they're following
[1:52:19] Moses's ministry.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; I want y'all to hold to that.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; They had a vindicated prophet. They left
[1:52:26] on the testimony of Moses.
[1:52:29] And there's three there's three stages
[1:52:31] of the journey. They left Egypt under
[1:52:32] justification believe in the word. They
[1:52:34] separated themselves from the Egyptians
[1:52:36] and COME OUT. THEY CROSSED THE RED SEA
[1:52:38] AND THEY KILLED THE THINGS BEHIND THEM
[1:52:40] WHICH WAS SANCTIFICATION THROUGH THE
[1:52:41] BLOOD THAT KILLS ALL HUMAN DESIRES OF
[1:52:43] EVIL. Second stage of the journey. BUT
[1:52:45] THE STIR STAGE OF THE JOURNEY IS WHEN
[1:52:47] THEY CROSSED JORDAN INTO THE PROMISED
[1:52:49] LAND WHERE THEIR INHERITANCE LAY. SEE
[1:52:52] THEIR THEIR INHERITANCE NEVER LAID IN
[1:52:54] EGYPT THOUGH GOD blessed them in Egypt.
[1:52:57] So, can I tell you this evening, don't
[1:53:00] be content with just coming out and
[1:53:01] leaving Egypt
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; with just living a justified life and a
[1:53:07] justified state. Don't be content with
[1:53:08] just crossing the Red Sea and seeing all
[1:53:10] the task masters destroyed and living a
[1:53:13] sanctified life. There is a third stage
[1:53:15] of the journey.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; There is a third stage of the journey
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; and that is a land of promise to every
[1:53:24] end time believer.
[1:53:27] And the paradox, brother Bam would tell
[1:53:29] us and now in a vision I might say this
[1:53:31] and I mention it once and I was going to
[1:53:33] cut the tape but believe that I'll leave
[1:53:35] it on here. says, "It was about 3:00 in
[1:53:37] the morning, I suppose, and I got up and
[1:53:39] I looked where in front of me and as I
[1:53:41] was coming down to Jordan, I looked
[1:53:43] down, I was standing on the map of
[1:53:44] Palestine, and I was coming down to
[1:53:47] Jordan. And it SEEMED LIKE I COULD hear
[1:53:48] the song, I'm going down to Jordan,
[1:53:51] someone was singing it. And as I drew
[1:53:52] near the river, I looked back and I seen
[1:53:55] which way I had come. AND I WAS
[1:53:57] TWOTHIRDS OF THE WAY TO JORDAN. AND I
[1:54:00] LOOKED ACROSS JORDAN AND I SAID, "OH,
[1:54:02] THE PRAISE GOD. JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE
[1:54:05] IS WHERE ALL THE PROMISES LAY. Every
[1:54:08] promise lays in the promised land." So
[1:54:12] here they come out
[1:54:15] on a vindicated voice
[1:54:17] and they stop twothirds of the journey.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; And the third pull, church, is the
[1:54:28] opening of the word,
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; the revealing of the mysteries. He says
[1:54:33] no more, there's no more higher order
[1:54:36] than to reveal the word than prophets,
[1:54:39] but the only way a prophet can be
[1:54:41] vindicated is by the word. So the third
[1:54:43] pool is not just speaking things into
[1:54:45] existence.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Their third pull is the opening of the
[1:54:50] word. It's what's let me ask you what's
[1:54:52] more important speaking squirrels are to
[1:54:54] into existence or revealing the
[1:54:55] mysteries of God because it's the
[1:54:58] revelation of these seven mysterious
[1:55:00] mysteries that actually turn the heart
[1:55:02] of the believer back to the faith of the
[1:55:04] Pentecostal fathers.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; See the revealing of the word is the
[1:55:08] most important thing that a believer can
[1:55:10] have and that we as ministers can do is
[1:55:12] to reveal the word
[1:55:15] is to reveal who Christ is. Amen.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; And we find here in Deuteronomy 2 and
[1:55:21] verse one,
[1:55:22] then we turned and we took our journey
[1:55:25] into the wilderness by the way of the
[1:55:26] Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me and I
[1:55:28] compassed and we compassed Mount Zir
[1:55:31] many days and the Lord spake unto me
[1:55:33] saying, "You have compassed this
[1:55:35] mountain long enough.
[1:55:41] He's taken us to a hiding place.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Egypt wasn't it.
[1:55:46] The mountain wasn't it.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; The desert wasn't it. Red Sea wasn't it.
[1:55:52] Jordan, as great as it was, it that's
[1:55:54] not it.
[1:55:56] HE SAYS, "YOU'VE COMPASS THIS MOUNTAIN
[1:55:58] LONG ENOUGH. Turn you northward.
[1:56:02] Otherwise, turn to Canaan. Turn to the
[1:56:05] land that I promised you."
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, notice Israel twothirds of
[1:56:10] their journey following Moses's message.
[1:56:15] A vindicated voice, a vindicated
[1:56:17] prophet. They come out, they cross the
[1:56:20] Red Sea, but they yet to enter into the
[1:56:23] third stage of the journey.
[1:56:26] They became content with just going to
[1:56:29] church.
[1:56:31] They were content with just believing
[1:56:32] God sent a prophet.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; We believe the message.
[1:56:37] I'm saying these things very direct for
[1:56:39] a purpose
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; because it's got to be more
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; than just God sending a prophet
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; and it's got to be more for some of you
[1:56:49] than just I believe a message
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; church. There is a third stage of the
[1:56:55] journey
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; that we must enter into
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; and that is your hiding place.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Going around the mountain preaching the
[1:57:10] same doctrines of repentance, preaching
[1:57:12] God sent a prophet, preaching, oh,
[1:57:14] there's a there's a message in the land,
[1:57:16] preaching all these things. And it's all
[1:57:18] it's done is just preaching and
[1:57:20] preaching and preaching and preaching.
[1:57:21] And all we've done is gone around the
[1:57:23] mountain. By this time, we should be in
[1:57:25] the promised land.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; We're 60 years past the dying of a
[1:57:29] prophet.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me we're only twothirds of
[1:57:32] the journey there.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Some of us,
[1:57:36] some of us, that's where we are. But I'm
[1:57:39] trying to tell you, there's more to this
[1:57:40] life. There's more to this message than
[1:57:44] just William Brandom
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; than just a prophet.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Though we need a prophet.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Please understand. I'm not saying we
[1:57:52] don't. Without a prophet, we don't enter
[1:57:54] into that land. Without that vindicated
[1:57:56] voice, we don't know where to go.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; But I'm trying to tell you, they went
[1:58:00] out on the testimony of a God sent
[1:58:03] prophet
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; and they hung up, Brother Derek,
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; in the wilderness
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; going round and round. Yes.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Fighting anxieties, struggling with
[1:58:13] fears,
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; battling depression, battling church,
[1:58:17] going through one camp meeting to the
[1:58:19] next camp meeting. Highs and lows of the
[1:58:21] message.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Came to Kadesh Barnea, three days
[1:58:27] journey from the promised land. Was able
[1:58:29] to look over and see, woo, man, evening
[1:58:32] light, man. Ron Spencer, oh my, Donnie
[1:58:36] Reagan, all look at that. Wayne Lawson,
[1:58:38] they got stuff going on in their
[1:58:40] churches.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; They were three days journey from the
[1:58:48] promised land,
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; but the old fighters
[1:58:52] kept fighting.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, this this is good. And all we've
[1:58:57] done is gone around and around. We don't
[1:59:00] need the the supernatural.
[1:59:03] We don't need the signs and wonders. We
[1:59:06] got the revealed word of God. Then why
[1:59:09] aren't you in the land?
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; That's where he's leading us is into
[1:59:15] that promised land.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; And once you're inside that promised
[1:59:20] land,
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; oh my [sighs]
[1:59:23] joy unspeakable and full of glory. You
[1:59:27] know, brother Mike, they can look over
[1:59:30] and maybe they would tell the
[1:59:31] testimonies of how man it took two to
[1:59:34] bring the grapes back.
[1:59:37] My they they would tell the testimonies
[1:59:39] of you know sporadically there may be
[1:59:41] the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in a
[1:59:42] service and you know then it'd be
[1:59:44] missing for months.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; They can look over they were three days
[1:59:49] journey they could see
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; but they really couldn't partake of it.
[1:59:57] Oh, it would come and it would go. It
[1:59:58] would come and it would go. It would
[1:59:59] come and it would go. But they wasn't
[2:00:01] there to abide in it.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; And that's what he's wanting. A people
[2:00:06] that would abide in Christ.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; And that Christ would abide in a people.
[2:00:10] Amen.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; They were three days journey and here 38
[2:00:15] years they were on the outskirts.
[2:00:19] Just looking in
[2:00:21] looking in
[2:00:24] on the outskirts of the promised land
[2:00:26] just preaching God sent a prophet just
[2:00:29] preaching. We believe a message.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; But see God's desire was to positionally
[2:00:38] placed them in the land. That's right.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; To adopt them as sons and daughters of
[2:00:42] God.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; For 38 years, they lacked the desire for
[2:00:47] the supernatural
[2:00:49] because it was ridiculed. It was made
[2:00:52] fun of. It was blasphemed
[2:00:55] and they let what the old warriors
[2:01:01] had to say about it keep them out of it.
[2:01:04] But I want you to understand the promise
[2:01:06] was still true. Amen.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; The promise still remained.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; And God is taking a people in Leodysa,
[2:01:18] taking them out of a Leodysian
[2:01:20] atmosphere, raising them up into a bride
[2:01:23] atmosphere so they can realize they're
[2:01:26] not part of Leodysia. They're not going
[2:01:28] to be lukewarm, laxidasical,
[2:01:31] but they're going to be on fire with the
[2:01:33] spirit of God.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] As we keep going, and I'm going to bring
[2:01:37] this down here shortly.
[2:01:39] I'll give you my word on that. See, God
[2:01:42] promised the Holy Spirit to every
[2:01:44] believer. So, he promised that land to
[2:01:48] every believer. And brother Bam says he
[2:01:51] wants to give it to you tonight more
[2:01:53] than you even want to receive it.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; And I wonder where some of us are. We
[2:01:59] struggle service after service. And we
[2:02:03] struggle in between services thinking is
[2:02:06] it for me? Can I be different? Can I
[2:02:09] receive it? Can I tell you it is for you
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; that he wants to give it to you even
[2:02:14] more than you want to receive it.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; See Kadesh Barnea means a time of
[2:02:19] decision. And you got to make a decision
[2:02:22] today in this service. There's a hiding
[2:02:25] place.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; There's a place of rest, a place of
[2:02:28] refuge, a place of safety. And it's in
[2:02:31] the Holy Ghost.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Are you just going to keep going around
[2:02:35] the mountain
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; circling the same old things, same old
[2:02:38] habits, same old fears, same old
[2:02:41] defeats,
[2:02:43] same old struggles. Oh, but I believe
[2:02:45] God's in a profit, but you're just going
[2:02:47] around and around and around and around.
[2:02:52] So, you got to make a decision.
[2:02:55] And I say, let's take the land today.
[2:02:58] musicians, won't you come?
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Let's take the land, church.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; He says, I go to prepare a place for
[2:03:06] you. If it wasn't so, I would have told
[2:03:08] you.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Not only is he got a land prepared, a
[2:03:12] place prepared. He's got a He's got it
[2:03:14] all ready. Well, the Ellie said he's got
[2:03:17] the wedding garment prepared. He's got
[2:03:19] the ring prepared. He's got the banquet
[2:03:21] prepared. He's got the house prepared.
[2:03:23] Everything that you have need of, he's
[2:03:26] already prepared it. Amen.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; And he's just waiting for somebody
[2:03:30] that'll take him at his word.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody says, "Thou art my hiding
[2:03:35] place."
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not running to psychology. I'm not
[2:03:39] running to, you know, this one or that
[2:03:41] one or this habit or that thing there.
[2:03:44] But the Lord
[2:03:46] is my hiding place, my place of rest.
[2:03:50] And in a time of trouble,
[2:03:53] in a time of wickedness,
[2:03:56] we realize today, church, that there's
[2:03:58] wars and rumors of war. There's Russia
[2:04:00] fighting a war with Ukraine. There's
[2:04:02] Hamas fighting a war with Israel. Then
[2:04:05] there's shouts of peace, peace in the
[2:04:07] Middle East. Our great president,
[2:04:09] fearless Trump going over there signing
[2:04:11] peace deals, trying to negotiate and
[2:04:13] barter, negotiate, using his his
[2:04:15] political power to bring peace in the
[2:04:17] Middle East. Where are we at?
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; They're building bomb shelters
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; thinking they're going to they're going
[2:04:27] to outlast. They're building bomb
[2:04:29] shelters, brother Derek, to stay here
[2:04:30] versus to leave.
[2:04:33] Don't you build a bomb shelter in your
[2:04:35] mind
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; thinking I'm going to live so close. I'm
[2:04:38] going to study the message. I'm going to
[2:04:39] do this. I'm going to do that. Just get
[2:04:40] into the hiding place.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Just receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:04:44] Ghost. Just consecrate your life to God.
[2:04:46] He says, "Oh, they're building THEY'RE
[2:04:48] BUILDING THESE GREAT BIG BOMB SHELTERS
[2:04:50] AND YOU KNOW WHEN THEM BOMBS HIT, IT'LL
[2:04:51] BLOW a hole 150 50 MILES WIDE and so
[2:04:56] many feet deep." HE SAID, "IT'LL CRUSH
[2:04:58] EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY." HE SAYS, "WE
[2:05:00] HAVE ONE BOMB SHELTER [music]
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT MADE WITH STEEL. IT'S NOT
[2:05:05] MADE BY MAN'S HANDS, BUT IT'S UNDER THE
[2:05:07] FEATHER OF HIS WINGS." THAT'S THE
[2:05:10] BELIEVER'S TRUE HIDING PLACE. AND GOD
[2:05:12] SENT US A MESSAGE IN THIS HOUR TO BRING
[2:05:15] YOU THERE, TO SHELTER YOU, AND TO
[2:05:17] PROTECT US.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; And I can say like David said, God,
[2:05:22] [music]
[2:05:24] thou
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; and thou alone
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; are my hiding place.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Let us just stand. I want you to bow
[2:05:33] your heads this morning.
[2:05:36] Thou
[2:05:38] and thou alone
[2:05:41] are my hiding place.
[2:05:43] Maybe you're here and you've gone
[2:05:44] through [music] trials and situations,
[2:05:50] but can you say like David,
[2:05:53] though the Lord's [music] hand was heavy
[2:05:55] upon me,
[2:05:58] thou art my hiding place,
[2:06:01] thou shalt preserve me
[2:06:05] from all evil,
[2:06:09] and songs of praise shall indwell
[2:06:12] develop me.
[2:06:14] If that's you this morning, just lift
[2:06:16] your hand to God with every head bowed,
[2:06:18] every eye closed.
[2:06:21] Lord, I want you this morning. [music]
[2:06:24] I don't want to just hear about a
[2:06:25] vindicated voice. I don't want to just
[2:06:27] go through the motions of church [music]
[2:06:29] and church antity and doing what we
[2:06:32] supposed to do as believers. But God, I
[2:06:33] really want an experience. I want to I
[2:06:35] want to find peace. I want to find rest
[2:06:39] in that land.
[2:06:42] I don't want to look out and say what I
[2:06:45] got to give up. I want to die this
[2:06:48] morning, Lord, to the things of the
[2:06:49] world.
[2:06:51] [music]
[2:06:53] Father, you see every hand that's lifted
[2:06:55] this morning.
[2:06:58] [music] You see every young person's
[2:06:59] hand raised, Father, every old alike.
[2:07:03] Lord, you know the struggles that they
[2:07:05] face. of God, right here in this moment,
[2:07:07] in this atmosphere.
[2:07:09] I believe you [music] can draw nigh,
[2:07:10] Lord. It's after the trial, after the
[2:07:12] tribulation
[2:07:14] that the presence of the Lord draws
[2:07:16] near.
[2:07:17] And we receive the promise, the fourth
[2:07:19] man, the angel of the Lord, Elohim
[2:07:22] [music] speaking to us. Melzdc after the
[2:07:24] battle.
[2:07:26] Father, how we thank you for this
[2:07:28] message. But Lord, may we not just rest
[2:07:31] [music] on God sending a voice. How may
[2:07:34] we follow that voice into that land to
[2:07:37] the fullness of the word of God, the
[2:07:40] opening of the word. Father, I pray
[2:07:44] you'll continue to bless us and pour out
[2:07:46] your [music] spirit, God, on Evening
[2:07:48] Light Tabernacle, Lord, and churches
[2:07:49] around the world that are standing
[2:07:51] faithful and gallant and true to the
[2:07:53] message. They're not [music]
[2:07:55] interjecting their own ideas, Lord, but
[2:07:57] they're staying faithful to the to the
[2:07:59] word of God. Preaching what a prophet
[2:08:01] pro [music] what he preached, Lord.
[2:08:04] God, help us to get ourselves out of the
[2:08:06] way and help us to reconsecrate and to
[2:08:09] consecrate our lives, Lord, with the
[2:08:10] greatest sincerity and truth that we can
[2:08:13] rightly divide the word
[2:08:16] and speak things of life. Lord, I thank
[2:08:18] you for our church. I thank you for the
[2:08:20] believers here, Lord. each and every
[2:08:22] one.
[2:08:24] I thank you Lord what they consist
[2:08:26] Father how we come together Lord week in
[2:08:30] and week out we have fellowship one with
[2:08:33] another Father and as iron sharpen his
[2:08:36] iron so does we sharpen one another
[2:08:38] Father
[2:08:40] I pray you'll sharpen your people today
[2:08:42] God I pray you'll just Lord draw them
[2:08:46] into that place that secret chamber God
[2:08:50] the things of the world is sealed out
[2:08:51] and you're [music] sealed in all the
[2:08:54] cares, all the struggles, all the
[2:08:55] difficulties. God, I worship you through
[2:08:58] it all. Father, forgive us where we've
[2:09:00] failed you. Forgive us where we have
[2:09:02] come short. [music]
[2:09:04] God, our desire is to make it all the
[2:09:06] way. Not just twothirds of the journey,
[2:09:10] but into the hiding place. We ask in
[2:09:12] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:09:18] Are you?
[2:09:21] There's a crowd. [singing]
[2:09:24] There's [music] a worry
[2:09:28] deep inside.
[2:09:32] There's a longing [singing]
[2:09:33] [music]

[2:11:22] mystery

[2:15:52] [music and singing] was over,
[2:15:54] you
[2:15:56] fade away.
[2:15:59] [music]
