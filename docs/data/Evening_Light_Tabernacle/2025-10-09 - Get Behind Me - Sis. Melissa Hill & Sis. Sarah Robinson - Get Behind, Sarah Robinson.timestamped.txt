[0:15] When fear like a viper strikes
[0:18] and worry starts to creep. I know that
[0:23] ain't my father's horse. It could only
[0:27] be that liar in my ear trying to make me
[0:33] believe. So I'm calling him out in the
[0:37] name of the Lord
[0:39] when I speak.
[0:42] Devil, get behind me. Run on home to the
[0:46] grave where you belong. In case you
[0:49] forgot, let me tell you the truth.
[0:52] You're stuck under my blood for food.
[0:55] Devil, get behind me. You got no hope.
[0:58] I've been changed by the Holy Ghost. Try
[1:02] all you want, but it ain't no use.
[1:05] You're stuck under my blood. Get behind
[1:09] me.
[1:11] Get behind me.
[1:14] Devil, get behind me.
[1:17] [Music]
[1:21] It's the power that raised my savior.
[1:24] It's the power that lives in me. So if
[1:28] you want to pick a fight, you better
[1:30] think twice. Cuz he's got an angel on
[1:34] me. Devil, get behind me.
[1:38] Back to the grave where you belong. In
[1:42] case you forgot, let me tell you the
[1:44] truth. You're stuck under my blood for
[1:48] food. Devil, get behind me. You got no
[1:51] hope. I've been changed by the Holy
[1:54] Ghost. Try all you want, but it ain't no
[1:58] use. You're stuck under my blood. Get
[2:02] behind me.
[2:05] Get behind me.
[2:08] Devil, get behind me.
[2:12] In the name of the Lord. In the name of
[2:14] the Lord. Get behind me.
[2:18] Get behind me.
[2:21] Devil, get behind me.
[2:25] In the name of the Lord.
[2:29] Devil, get behind me. Run on home. Back
[2:33] to the grave where you belong. In case
[2:36] you forgot, let me tell you the truth.
[2:39] You're stuck under my blood. Boots.
[2:42] Devil get behind me. You got no hope.
[2:46] I've been changed by the Holy Ghost. Try
[2:49] all you want, but it ain't no use.
[2:52] You're stuck under my blood. Get behind
[2:56] me.
[2:59] Get behind me,
[3:02] devil. Get behind me
[3:06] in the name
[3:09] of the Lord.
