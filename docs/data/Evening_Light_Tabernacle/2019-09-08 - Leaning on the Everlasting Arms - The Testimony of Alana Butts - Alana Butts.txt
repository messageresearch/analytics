TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] we made an appointment with my primary care physician who had ordered the allergy testing to start with and she just I told her about my cough that was going on and that had gotten worse I told her about the fatigue that was bothering me the aversion to food and about just overall malaise that I was dealing with and she automatically just ordered a chest x-ray I showed her the lumps on my chest and she thought it might be in the rib cage at the bone and so um she decided to order chest x-rays and wanted it kind of a strange angle that actually shows the bone structure as well and fell so I went to the hospital and had that done and David was in there with me when I had the x-ray done and when he saw the x-ray he was very alarmed because the hole right long area was totally white and being in the medical field himself he seen x-rays many x-rays before and he knew that this was not just a little cough problem anymore and so um the next day the doctor called me in she said Elana she said I'm looking at your report of your x-ray and she said I do not like what I'm what I see here and she said there's a mass in your lung and um she said it looks like cancer she said now I want you to see an oncologist but and I she said I can't say for sure that it's cancer I've been wrong twice this year I sent somebody to an oncology and call oncologist who thought it was I thought it was lung cancer and it turned out that it was not it was a strange infection she said so I could be wrong on this but I do want you to be prepared that it's quite possible that this is what is going on here and so you can imagine the shock that we felt at something that we felt was probably just going to be a routine checkup and some pneumonia or something like that and so this was a Friday and we had the weekend to digest this information and so we let family and friends know I called my mom and told her and she she said Elena she said you can tell me these things before they escalate to a point like this and I said mom you've known everything that has happened and I said you know as much as I've known but I didn't realize either I had no idea it happened so gradually I didn't realize that these symptoms were all together pointing to something that potentially is serious so anyway and we we told people in the church and they began praying and things and um we didn't get very much sleep that night as we considered the possibilities of course your mind just tends to go very extreme in a case like that and so David was up walking the driveway 3:30 the next morning and it was actually very hard to look at each other um during that weekend because you know that it could be something very serious that would take you away from each other and um it was something that's actually indescribable unless you've gone through it but I just I just felt like God is God and I felt like this time I could trust him and from the beginning I made a decision that I was going to look to the Word of God and that I was not going to fear this thing and of course you cannot stop the thoughts that come into your mind at a moment like this but when they would come in I would say but the Word of God says he's a healer of all my diseases and so um Saturday the next day we sat down with our children in the living room and we told them we said they've all been raised in a Christian home they you know from the day they were born and we said this is what the doctor is found it could be an infection and it could be cancer and we believe we're believing for it to be an infection but we said if it's not God is still God and we're making a choice to just believe him we're not gonna fear this thing we said all the shouting and praising the Lord that we do in church all the singing that we do it's all about this moment we've not had huge trials in our family and if this is our moment we're going to trust God and we're gonna be real soldiers and do it with all our heart and so we were talking to them and David said some things to them along the same lines and the Holy Spirit just came down in that room such tremendous annoyed and it brought that comfort to my heart and I've always wondered you know we have lady and a couple in our church who has who lost a child and through sickness and heart problems and I wondered at the time how do they walk through this with such dignity and in that moment I knew how you do it because God is the comforter I never felt such peace in my life as I felt at that moment so we just talked with the family and prayed together and then everybody went away and then David went outside and proceeded to mow all 20 acres of our property I was concerned about the trees and everything as he just digested all of this and started to fight his own battle which is unique to somebody who works in the medical field but I was texting a friend later on and I told her I said I can walk through anything if that presence is with me like it was today so I did not know what was ahead of me but I met it and this time there was an anchor that have been missing the year before [Music] so next I was scheduled to start seeing an oncologist and so I did that I went to my first appointment and he asked me of course about all my symptoms and all of that and I just as as we were there he just said I don't think you had lung cancer and I said oh so you don't think I have cancer he said no I don't think you have lung cancer he said your symptoms don't fit that he said perhaps lymphoma he said perhaps tuberculosis or some infection like that we really don't know and so we're gonna start running some tests so they did a whole series of blood work you know vials for blood work and and started doing some testing and ordered a CT scan and that showed up that I had a lymph node swollen under my arm which turned out to be 2 to 3 centimeters in size but I didn't know about it was deep enough and so he ordered a he ordered a biopsy of that lymph node now as I said I've never really had any procedures done or anything and just the thought of that was very unnerving to me and I just I told people I don't do pain you know they sound uncomfortable I don't do pain you know and so um it was everything from the ground up was a new experience to me and it was very frightening at the onset and I just said god I'm looking to you for everything that I go through you will be with me whether I feel it or not these different hospitals that I'm being sent to in different clinics they're all they all have their own atmosphere and many of them are not atmospheres of faith and you kind of feel like you're you know the only one in there but that that believes but somehow I just believe the Lord would be with me and now and then I did had a really nice experience with somebody who was a Christian the lady who drew my blood at the oncologist as she drew it she said we're just gonna pray that every one of these comes back negative and it would just be a very positive thing in your day as you were fighting your mind battles they did the biopsy under my arm they did a bronchoscopy where they went down and biopsy inside my lung and did some took some cultures out of there to test for infection they were very perplexed by my case because my symptoms didn't specifically match cancer or infection and meanwhile I was just feeling worse and worse all the time Mike off had gotten very bad and then I started to have a weight in my stomach almost like when you're expecting a baby that is so I felt like I needed to stretch out like this a lot of the time and at this time I can only figure that it had something to do with my lung not wanting to expand properly but my appetite was just I had no appetite whatsoever as they did these different tests everything came back negative they just were as I said very perplexed by it and finally they decided that I needed to have a lung surgery called of that done where they go in from the side and they take pretty impressive wedges out of your lung incident test that for infection and for any sort of cancer and so meanwhile my mom having found out that I had the mass in my lung decided to come visit and she lives in Canada where I am originally from and so she decided to come stay with me if only to cook because if I cooked my own food it made it that much harder to eat it so um she came and stayed with me and started helping with the housework and helping with the children because I was just becoming less and less able to care for myself and just losing interest in life in general and so um she came and stayed with me and and so when I had the surgery she stayed with the children and the surgery went very well and they did some testing during the surgery and found out that there was nothing everything was coming back negative and so after my um after the surgery was over I had a follow-up appointment this by now were into December from October to December they were doing all this testing I'd seen a couple of pulmonologists different pulmonologists and was kind of being passed around from one facility to another while I did testing the day that I went in to have my surgery done of course this was a bigger deal even than the other procedures that I'd had done and naturally I wasn't looking forward to it and I read a sermon by William Brennan which is something that I do regularly because I I feed on those sermons they're a lifeline to me they're so inspired by God and and he was speaking about Satan and he said Satan following you along that great big king kingly priestly Goliath trying to scare the liver at of you but you're fortified by the word and as I went in for this surgery I said yes that is exactly what it is this Goliath is trying to scare the liver out of me and I refuse to bow to that and I have the Word of God that is going to protect me no matter what I go through and that is what I told people when they'd ask how I was doing I would say I feel rotten I have no appetite and God is with me and God is my healer and that was my confession throughout this entire ordeal and it wasn't what I always felt but it's what I always believed so um a week after my surgery I had a follow-up appointment by now we were into well into December and so when I went there the doctor said he said we've sent your the cultures and biopsies and things off to the University of Michigan for a second opinion on them and he said I don't think you have cancer he said maybe you'll have just an interesting infection named after you and it was kind of a light-hearted conversation but it's very positive he said those results will take about two weeks to get back or could take up to two weeks and so I left and the very next day I had an appointment at another hospital and this was a follow-up from a previous bronchoscopy that I'd had done it was a lesser test and we already had gotten all the results back from that and everything had been negative on infection and so we actually thought about not showing up for that appointment and just calling and cancelling it because we were past that into the bigger surgery but decided just to keep the appointment and these this pulmonologist had been in contact with the surgeon who had just done the major surgery and they'd been talking back and forth about the results so David and I went to this appointment at a hospital and the appointment it the wait was very long the children were at home waiting for supper and hours were passing I felt as sick as a dog I would get up and walk around to feel a little better and then I'd sit down trying to feel a little better and I was just feeling bad by this time I was having severe sweats where I would just soak through a whole layer of clothes just when everybody else was freezing and so I was sweating profusely when the doctor came in he sat down and he said so you've you've gotten your results that you have Hodgkin's lymphoma and I just stared at him I said no i said i think that was being considered but they've sent the results off to the university of michigan and it will be a few weeks before we get them back and he said no these are the results from the University of Michigan they just came in and he said you have Podge consumed FOMA and he had assumed that we knew this and I was just in shock I could just feel my face just turning hot you know moving up and David was just staring at him and he started to talk about what Hodgkin's lymphoma was classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and he said it's the good news is that it's treatable he said you should regain back lung function and he said we treated with chemotherapy and radiation and he said your doctor your oncologist has been informed and about that time David's phone started ringing and it was already my oncologist calling him and we were just stunned and he said you have any questions and I said well I just need some time to digest this so I guess I just need to think about it before I come up with questions and he said I'm sorry to deliver this news to you week before Christmas and I said well no you can't help that we drove home and he said you can you talk to the kids cuz you tell them what you want them to know I said okay we went in and we told the kids we said the doctors have talked to us and they've told us I do have cancer and we said this changes nothing we said what we told you about this situation at the beginning is what we hold to right now is that God is a healer we are not going to fear this thing we said mama mama might get really sick for a while and we need you guys to be the very best you can be but you know things might look a little rough around here for a while but we're gonna just work together and we're just gonna trust God that everything's gonna be okay and my mom had actually gone back home when I'd had this lung surgery after it was over she'd gone back home we thought oh we were gonna get I was gonna take some antibiotics and everything was gonna be fine and so she had not planned to come back but we we called her and let her know what was gonna happen what was happening and told the family in the church and in and so that just opened a whole new chapter for us the oncologist wanted to meet with us right away after after receiving this diagnosis so the next day we met with him and he sat down and he gave me the papers with what drugs I would be receiving he told me that I would probably require radiation because the tumor in my lung was about seven centimeters big and he said with that tumor burden that's how he referred to it he said usually we do radiation but because of its location you would actually be injuring the breast as well and a lot of times women will end up having breast cancer from the radiation years down the road if they're young enough to live that long and he already had three patients who had that problem from having had radiation so he was hesitant to do that but yet felt like it might be necessary regardless he said I would need the full regimen of chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma he said it was Stage four because it was already in an organ and he said that would include 12 treatments two weeks apart and it was four separate drugs he said they'd recently switched out one drug because it was better on the lung than what the previous drug had been and this was a very recent development although it it had been studied for a few years but that was good news to me because my problem was literally in the lung and I didn't need more problems in my lung as well but he just said I'm gonna sit down and tell you what you can expect with chemotherapy and he said when you've had enough you tell me because this is very overwhelming information and I understand that and we can pick up another time if you know when you've had enough so he started to write down the side effects that I would deal with and how I would feel this day and you know just launched into it and it was just surreal really you picture other people going through this sort of thing but you never picture yourself in that situation but somehow when I came away from that appointment for some reason I actually felt a little better I guess unknown can be more fearful than being told exactly what to expect and he was a very gentle very gentle doctor and very kind and understanding and so he just explained what to expect and I realized that he does this every day and anyway somehow I came away not feeling like I was gonna make it I I don't know how to explain the fact that you can feel like you're on a runaway cart while you also feel like God is in control and so after that I was put through a series of tests I had to have my lungs tested to see if they could stand up to chemotherapy they did a heart test as well they I met with a doctor to have my port put in which they would use to put the chemotherapy into my body and all of this was just of course very a lot to take in in just a couple of days especially when I thought I was going to go on antibiotics for an infection and so um that we received the diagnosis on Tuesday met with the doctor on Wednesday before Christmas and had appointments the next day and so by Friday it was a first day for me to be home quietly since my diagnosis I hadn't really had a good cry about it I hadn't had time to think much about it but that day I had some time to myself and it started to sink in as to what was ahead of me and I was feeling very sick already and I just felt like I would not be able to fight you have to fight through chemotherapy and I thought I don't have fight in me I'm already sick and tired of being sick and tired and so I was overwhelmed by what was ahead of me and frankly I started to become frightened and I was just thinking about it and I just thought I cannot do this I said Lord I know you're gonna be with me you said you would be but I don't want to go through it and so the next morning David was doing some work in the garage and I went out and that's what I told him I said David I just I started to cry I said I don't want to go through this I know God is gonna help me I don't doubt that for a second but I just don't even want to go near it he said I wish I could take some of it from you and I said I wish you could too I was that desperate at that point but um he just held me for a few minutes and I had a little cry and I went back in the house and I picked up my phone and there was a screenshot that Naomi will send a girl in our church and sent me and it was a little quotation from a sermon called hear his voice and it said don't be scared honey God is watching you the devil may try to do something to you but God's greater and it was taken from the sermon where William Branham was talking about Marion putting Moses in the bulrushes and that's what I felt that's how I felt at that moment too is that I was launching out into something way out of my control and way out of just beyond anything that I felt like I was prepared for but yet when that came through on my phone phone I knew that was God that caused her to send that to me and I felt it was supernatural just like reading about the girl healed of Hodgkin's lymphoma I knew that was a supernatural moment because we serve a supernatural God and he will be there for you in whatever you go through and in your most desperate dark times he's to help you and I felt that found that for myself it just gave me courage once again to know that he was gonna be with me so this was Saturday the following Monday was Christmas and it was the strangest Christmas of my life I felt as sick as a dog I saw on social media everybody's celebrating with their families and I felt so strange I felt like nothing in my life was recognizable anymore nothing in my body was recognizable anymore and I almost didn't know how to interact with my family because I thought what if I am to be taken away from them there's there's all these thoughts that go through your mind you know but I just when I'd have these thoughts I would just turn from them and say God you are my healer you said you'd be with me I don't know where this is going to take me but you said you would be with me and that's I kept going back to that and kept going back to that I thought I'm gonna be a real soldier and a real child of God and I put my trust in the fact that he loves me whether I was feeling it at that moment or not he's his promises to his children are full of love and compassion and so that's what I trusted and in those moments where I think life was very overwhelming the day after Christmas I went in for surgery to have my port inserted into my shoulder area and when I got up that morning on my phone there there was a scripture I because I have the Bible app and it was Isaiah 41:10 feared though not for I'm with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yea I will help thee yea I will uphold thee with the right my right hand of righteousness and I felt like God gave me that scripture for that day and that is a scripture that carried me through my chemotherapy I posted it all over my house and read it daily many times a day sometimes I will help thee that when I needed help I'd say God I'd hold him to it I said God you said you would help me and I am looking to you for that help I need it this moment and that day that marine when I went in for surgery Beth Adams a girl in our church sent me that same scripture she also had the Bible app and it popped up on her phone and she sent it to me and I said out of the mouth of two or three witnesses it was like God in an audible voice with telling me I've got this and we're gonna be okay [Music] the next day was Wednesday I was scheduled for a PET scan and that shows where cancer is located in your body because they knew it was in the lung but they didn't know where else and they didn't do it prior to this time because insurance will not cover it unless they already know you have cancer and so I went from my pet skin and I came home I was there a few hours and I came home and I was resting from that because they give you valium and David came home from work he said doctor the doctor wants you to come in and start chemotherapy today and I was like here we go okay let's go so I got up right then and we left the children at home and we went in for my first chemotherapy appointment every treatment I took David and I just prayed over it we we'd always said if it ever came to the time when we had cancer or anything we probably wouldn't take any more therapy we we discussed it a few times I would hate to go through that it just wouldn't be worth it but when it was when I found out I had cancer there was no question in my mind that I was to take the chemotherapy I did not feel like I was to take the radiation and I felt from the beginning that that was not an option for me and I didn't tell the doctor that but I told other people I won't be taking the radiation I'm gonna trust God with that part that he'll take care of that so we prayed over the chemotherapy treatment that it would go right to its mark and do it it was supposed to do and that I would not have to deal with horrible side effects and I always am amazed that in the Old Testament God would say to the Israelites the diseases that come upon the other nations will not come upon you and the things that they deal with it's different for you and I felt I'm his every every bit his child as much as what those people were and so I can have expectations that I get special treatment not because I'm better than anybody else but just because I'm his child and that is not unique to me it's just unique to his children and that's something that I begin to just believe for myself so they told me each treatment is gonna you're gonna feel a little worse they put a little bit more of the medication in every time your body it's very foreign to your body and your body's not gonna like it and so they said you could feel progressively worse with each treatment a lot of medications to help me get through the treatments the stomach problems that they expect you to have the nausea to ward off any vomiting and things like that they tell you're gonna feel very fatigued you know they just prepare you for all sorts of things and they actually don't prepare you for everything only the top five and so um I went home and it started a whole new cycle for me because not only was i dealing with lymphoma I was also dealing with the chemotherapy treatments and so by this time I was so sick that I was talking very little around the house if the kids wanted to know can I can we go here can we do this I'd say ask Abigail ask daddy that's about as much as I wanted to say I did not want to make decisions I'd lost interest in all of that I cared about my kids but I could not I felt too sick to even make basic decisions with regards to them and Dana like I said there is all sorts of other things that started happening literally from the moment the chemotherapy goes into your body you start to notice things and I just began turning these things over to God you know they said watch for tingling and numbness in your fingers and in your toes for neuropathy and so when I'd start to feel the tingling I'd say God I can't do anything about this but you said you would help me and you said you're a healer and I'm praying that you will take care of my extremities my lung by this time felt like it was made of lead it felt like there was no expansion in it it got worse I would get up at night and I would when I would breathe in those first few breaths when I got out of bed at night it felt like the breath came out in in three pieces it was like and before it would really start coming out normal and I felt like it was scraping over bones I don't really know what to this day what was happening but it felt like it was scraping over something inside and it was very frightening in itself and I just thought I am NOT gonna worry about this I cannot worry about this God you created my lung I believe that you're gonna heal it and I would go to the restroom do what I had to do and go back to bed and just go back to sleep and that's what I did all day every day when I had to eat a meal which was one of the most horrific things that I dealt with during this entire time was having to make myself eat and I would say God just get me through this meal help me to get it down because I've got to keep this weight on by the time I was at the end of my first treatment I was I had dropped about nine pounds from my pre fitness weight which on my frame who was very significant and worrisome I no longer was recognizing my body the way it felt even sitting on a chair was uncomfortable and it was overwhelming and I said god I'm looking to you to help me with my meals to help me gain weight I was some at 2,000 calories a day I was still losing weight I had to get over 2,000 I had to get 2,000 calories to maintain weight at least and to gain it was more like 2300 calories a day and I was doing nothing so my body was just working through an unbelievable rate and my mom spent a good part of her day trying to get fat into me she would pour oil over my lasagna she would give me glasses of orange juice with oil in them I would have cereal with heavy whipping cream on them we would just do anything we could to make to get extreme amounts of calories in small amounts of food because I could not take in large amounts of food so um my bathroom started to look like a pharmacy with all the medications that the doctor given me I've never been one to take more than one ibuprofen at a time thankfully I've been very healthy and rarely needed it and I hate it to even take any of the medications to keep things moving in my body and keep them functioning properly but I just said God even if I take these will you just take care of my body you know in the same way that I believe you are with the chemotherapy the first the first treatment left me you know it was very difficult on my body because of the lymphoma symptoms at the same time I missed the first three church services which were very difficult for me I hated to see the family go off and leave me at home but I just began to pray that the Lord would help me to be able to go to church and and that those were the only church services I missed the whole time I went through chemotherapy I made it to every single service after that sometimes I would be laying on the couch at 2 o'clock on a Wednesday evening and the kids would say mom you gonna go to church and I'd say I'm sure gonna try my stomach is hurting so bad but I'm gonna try and but about 3 o'clock I'd feel a little better and I'd get up and get ready for church and heat a little something and I was able to go and I usually felt terrible while I was there but I it was such a lifeline for me and the things that would form ministered wouldn't minister to me so deeply I didn't care who was around me but they'd minister that God is God is bigger and that you can speak to your Mountain I would stand up and I'd showed that's me Lord that's me I felt that so deeply because I'm his child and these things that were being preached applied to me in my situation and I knew it and I claimed it from my own and I knew that God was moving in my life and even though I had many doubts and many fears and may thoughts passed through my head you're not gonna make it to your 41st birthday you know and you got cancer for your 40th birthday and you're not gonna make it I had thoughts upon thoughts and that changed nothing I'd say Satan you are a liar those are your thoughts I believe the Word of God and I didn't always feel spiritual I didn't sometimes the text would come through and somebody would give me a scripture and I'd read not just put it down I couldn't even digest it and later on I'd go back and read it and say yes Lord that is true and it would encourage me the people in the church would send me cards with scriptures in them I would lay on the couch and just have them on the table and read them over and over till I had to memorize and the text that came through sometimes it was supernatural the things that it said would be exactly what I'd been dealing with and so how can you doubt a God who speaks to you like that and who is so present in your worst moments [Music] gradually it got to the place I got through that first treatment it was very difficult but by the second treatment [Music] brother Tim our pastor sent the text to David and I and it was a scripture second chronicles 20 verse 15 and in it it says the battle isn't yours but God and I thought about that and I thought how can the battle be his if I'm the one fighting I'm the one who's down here just working away at overcoming this thing and getting through this how can this battle be God but I saw in the Old Testament where the Israelites dealt in a physical realm things that we deal with in a spiritual realm and I saw how they just had to call on God and say look what they're saying about us look with the enemy feint about us and he'd say go to sleep I've got this don't worry about it and the next morning they get up and their enemy was dead like they just all be dead on the ground and I thought God if you'd do that for them you do that sort of thing today because you'd never change the word says you never change and so I said God I'm looking to you to fight my battle well that evening I got a card from a sister in our church Mary Katherine she had told me when I first got sick she said I will be sending you cards ready get ready with scriptures and written encouragement in them and that evening she sent me I received a card and it had the exact same scripture 2nd chronicles 20 verse 15 the battle isn't yours but gods and she wrote declare war on the devil no no retreat and I said you're telling me that you're gonna fight my battle and I don't know how you're gonna do it I don't understand because I feel like right now I'm the one who's going through all this stuff but if you tell me you're gonna fight my battle I believe you have something supernatural for me and from that moment on I didn't just believe for a healing I started to believe for something over and above something miraculous and the only thing that I could think of that would be him taking on my battle it was for him to take away the chemotherapy completely and I thought the only way that that's gonna happen would be for me to get a clear PET scan and I say god I don't want to put you in a box perhaps there's other another way you can do it because you're that kind of God you can come up with something but I knew that after four treatments I would have a PET scan and then I'd have no more PET scans until after the good thing 12 treatments were complete I said maybe you have something else for me but all I know is I'm believing for something supernatural and that you're taking on my battle meanwhile I I started my second treatment and I began to lose my hair the doctor told me that by the third treatment I would have no hair left and so right before church on a Wednesday night I was brushing my hair and the first the hair brush came out full of hair and I just looked at that I took a picture of it I said this is gonna mean something to me like this is the beginning of something you know that I've never had to deal with before and I looked at it it seemed very surreal I already had this aversion of food and all of a sudden this was turning my stomach to be losing this kind of hair and I just could already look at it but hearing this a melon rider so every time I brush my hair after that it would fall out I would braid it and I touch up here and it would all just come loose and it would be stuck in the braid but would just be loose I couldn't even keep my hair tidy during that time and so for the next week and a half my hair was just falling out constantly it became bald in the front and in the back first and so I started to wear a headband around it just to get me through and I'd have it just braided in the back loosely mom and I actually had a very funny moment one night I was getting ready we were about to go to bed but we were talking for a minute and I was sitting in the living room and I sneezed and my head just fell forward and we just laughed we said don't sneeze to her the whole braid is gonna fly off you know so we just giggles a little bit about that and then we thought this is really sick that we're finding us the least bit amusing but we did anyway one morning during this time I got up and written on the chalkboard was a scripture of debt every hair on your head is numbered my husband did rib met his encouragement to me it stood by my side in all of this I told the Lord when I was going through this I said would I come out will you help me to be the best place that I can be because of the way that he'd stood by my side and it all backrubs many times a day when my back would ache so bad from the chemotherapy he waited on me hand and foot and he wrote scriptures on the chalkboard to encourage me that he'd read that morning when he got up to go to work and I believed that every hair on my head if indeed number I knew that [Music] thankfully my treatments were actually better than what most people experience they were horrific every day was a battle and every day was different the way chemotherapy cycles work as you deal with different symptoms at different times in your cycle and so you never knew with what was ahead of you although you did recognize a bit of a pattern and after you'd had a couple of cycles of chemotherapy I was at the in the process of losing my hair it took about a week and a half for most of it to come out I I was avoiding washing it for a while because my scalp hurt a lot and because I knew that it was going to make a huge mess when I washed it because I knew a lot was gonna come out but finally I'd had enough and I washed it one day on a Thursday and when I was done I began to brush it and most of the remaining hair came all out in the next 30 minutes and it was a horrific process to really realize the finality of it I did not recognize myself in the mirror because there were strands still hanging down just at the back I looked like something out of a horror movie and it was a definitely a difficult process but I made a decision to ask one of the ladies in our church to come shave my head my scalp was quite tender at this time and she came over it saved mom and David emotional situation of having to be the ones to do it so the sister came over because she had done it once before to another for another that you had cancer and so I had a piece in my heart but my body hadn't quite caught up with me and I sweated the whole time I was having my head shaved soaked through the entire set of clothes she prayed before we did it and it was a beautiful prayer and very comforting and then she shaved my head while my mom cleaned the hair up off the floor and we cried together and it was over another short while and then I felt so much better it was behind me I felt clean bald head is better than a few strands let me tell you it's a lot less frightening I felt clean and good and I felt like I could move on so I began to wear hats I bought several different colors and things to go with my different outfits and I knew that God would restore my hair so as the days went on and I dealt with the things that you deal with in chemotherapy there's not a part of your body that doesn't ache itch hurt tingle burn there is literally not one part of my body that in some way was not affected by the chemotherapy or the lymphoma and so each day came down two hours and sometimes minutes to just get through that working to try to get through my food trying not to look too miserable I had stomach pains that were kind of unique to this kind of chemotherapy and the doctor did try different things with it but sometimes only certain positions would relieve the pain a little bit so as funny as it sounds coming at this time one of my kids would walk by my room and I'd be crawling around on the floor and they're like mom are you okay and I'm like just pray for mommy and I'm sure it had to be very frightening for them to see me act so strangely you know and there were a few nights I literally slept in a recliner upside down with my legs up the back of my head I'm the foot of the recliner because it was the only position I could get comfortable in until all the blood drained in my head and then I had to change position but there was all sorts of non dignifying things that take place during chemotherapy and thankfully the Lord was with me at all and I would tell him about my symptoms over and over again I would say God I can't do anything about my leg long but you're my healer I can't do anything about neuropathy but you are my healer and I'd say I'm sorry if I'm repeating this too much but it makes me feel better to tell you about it and that way I won't have to overburden my husband with it and worry him more and he listened I knew he did and I felt displeasure when I would trust him with the things I was going for I would feel him draw close and I told my dad who is not a Christian I said dad that healing angel is so close sometimes I can touch it I can almost touch him that's how much I believed that he was there but it did not make the situation easy it does not keep thoughts from coming in my mind lest anybody think that I'm super-spiritual or anything somebody said to me oh you'll make it through you're strong and I thought you have no idea I'm this weak as a kitten right now I feel like I couldn't I feel it's a weak as a kitten but God said he would be strong when I'm weak and that's what I was depending on anyway I told people I said this is Micah live I'm picking up stones and I'm about to cut his head off they're just something began to rise up in me and the more I fed it the more it rose up and the more pulsated and came out and it wasn't just me there was a whole church behind me rallying around me they'd have people say to me I have my doubts too and then the Lord said this to me or show me this or this song came to me and I say I know it were in it together and we're believing together and God is going to work one day my mom was working in the kitchen and I came into the living room to get something and she was there and I started to walk back to my bedroom and I turned around and I said mom I said I believe God is working in my situation I was thinking about that scripture brother Tim had sent about the battle and Mary Katharine had sent about the battle is the Lord's I said I believe God is working in my situation she said I do too I said no I mean something supernatural I believe God is gonna do something supernatural and tears came to her eyes and she said I do too we would share scriptures all of us would share scriptures the kids would write things on the board devil how a liar you are and we'd right yes that amen and things like that and we'd feed on that and I had cards from the church all strung across our fireplace and I'd stop and read them during the day and it would encourage my hurt all over again the church was bringing food by and doing many things to help me they had a food train we actually had a humorous moment one day when we looked at the chalkboard and it said appetizers it was a little chart that appetizers and main courses and it said soup soup soup soup soup soup soup soup which delaney or eleven-year-old had written on there and that week we'd had a lot of Sara podcasts but we all kind of giggled at that we had some funny moments it wasn't all just heaviness after I lost my hair I well always on Sundays I'll start getting ready for church and inevitably about the time I closed my bedroom door there's gonna be a knock from one of our five children and so I thought one day I thought I'm gonna get them so I shut the door and sure enough a minute later there was a knock on the door I said come in on bald and there's this pause and silence and then a little boy said oh that's okay and I was like oh didn't work you know but yeah but we did get a laugh out of that I did have a few bald jokes that I was allowed to say but the kids and David were not [Music] in thinking about um God fighting my battle I began to realize my mom had to leave to go back to Canada on February 28th she works in the accounting business and it was gonna be the start of tax season and so she was not gonna be able to stay and I started thinking about this it was also getting closer to the time of my my PET scan which they do after four treatments it's a way of monitoring how well your body is responding to lymphoma to the treatments for lymphoma they may also use it to decide whether they're gonna do radiation or how much and so um it's just a way of checking your progress and after that they just continue the rest of your treatments no questions asked and do a PET scan finally after your twelve treatments so it was approaching the time I'd had four treatments thankfully I had not that had the severe nausea and vomiting and things like that my fourth treatment I was going through a little Gethsemane not looking forward to it you know a couple of nights before that I thought I do not want to go through this next treatment I felt like I was still kind of recovering from the last one and and then I thought I don't have to accept that the first one's gonna be worse they told me they'll get progressively worse but I just thought I'm not going to sign up for that I'm gonna believe that this is gonna be the best treatment and believe it or not it was it was my easiest one I can honestly say that so um we went to church well to back up on Saturday February 17th I was getting ready for bed and my heart was so full of the goodness of God the things he'd done for me many of which that I've relayed to you and it was just overflowing okay and I was by myself and I thought God how can I ever thank you for your presence in all of this I know you're gonna do something supernatural for me but even beyond that just the way you've helped me and comforted me and sent things to me I know it's you and I know you're real and it just my heart was so full and I didn't know how to express it and I said how can I show people now while I'm sick I want to be able to show them how thankful I am to you and how grateful and that you're there for people when they go through a hard time I said I want to be able to express that somehow but I can't other than just in a text tell somebody God's healing my body and I believe his word or whatever so my heart was just very full in the next day February 18th we went to church in our pastor preached that God will do extreme things to get his people to believe and I knew I knew if it's true I knew it was for me and my heart was so full what was God doing God was doing some extreme things to start believing hey I'm sending you a Bible message with Bible doctrine with Bible holiness quick Bible truth with Bible joy with the

hallelu hallelujah praise our God trained to react in a formal way the Holy Ghost let him lift you up today to rise with him after service we were just worshiping and thanking God I had to sit in an isolated area of the church the mezzanine seating so that I wouldn't have to wear mask during that time it mask is very warm and I just was it prevented me from having to I could interact at a distance so I was sitting up in the mezzanine sitting with my family and brother Tim was singing leading singing and he changed his song to leaning on the everlasting arms and something welled up in me my heart was already so full and it just welled up that that's what I've been doing it's leaning on the everlasting arms and what a fellowship and a joy divine and you know it's overwhelming to my heart and a little voice that meets that very busy I didn't know what I was gonna do I stepped out of my seat and I went down the steps to the methane feed and that Joey just started to come out of me and I began to leap and go around the church and there was such a determination people think my vote in my face was almost fears that I was so determined to serve God and to show the devil [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what you don't see on the video is the real atmosphere that was there you don't see the response as people say to rejoice with me after as they started to see what was going on there was a whole atmosphere there that you can sense some of it but not nearly like it was there and even after it was all over the worship that came out of my mouth as they dismiss people it was just flowing out of me such an expression of beautiful words that were just coming out of me and thanks to God for all that he was doing in my life [Music] [Music] [Music] so many things had improved but I still had many symptoms my lung still felt like it was made of lead but I was not looking at that I said god you're my healer I don't know what you have in store for me I did not know even what the results of the PET scan would be but I just believed that God was in control and that he had something supernatural and I felt like this could be it because Mom was about to leave it just all lined up and because I believed I just believed God was moving so why not now I guess maybe was what I was thinking so I was I went into that PET scan and trying to read you know the lady who does the PET scan you're trying to read her reaction and she just acted the same as she went when she came out I guess you're ready for your burger she said you know because you can't eat before PET scan and I couldn't read anything from her reaction so that was fine and I went home and the next day I met with my oncologist and David was with me and she went into the appointment and when he came into the room the doctor came in he said he was seen your skin and we said no he said um he said the cancer is gone he said the cancer is gone this is dramatic he said here come look and he took us over to a computer and showed us a side by side to scan showing the mass of my lung that from the scan they'd taken two days after Christmas and then this was February the 19th skin and every spot of lymphoma every lymph node that was affected was totally clear the seventh centimeter tumor was totally clear from cancer the report was absolutely beautiful it was clear and he said this is dramatic and I thought yes because sometimes God is very dramatic and so on I just I thank God to this day that he spared me all those treatments I've been in contact with another woman who's going through this exact same regimen and the vomiting and the nausea that that poor lady is dealing with I'm no special person I should have gone through that and yet God spared me that's paint every night before I go to bed I think in force very few because that was so very sick I was so very tired of nothing and he gave me a special treatment just because I'm his child and because I believed him became that something that he promises to anybody who will believe him I took him at his word and he was right there to meet it and so the recovery actually has been rapid every day I've felt better and it was amazing how quickly my energy came back once the chemotherapy was over I wondered I wondered how long it would take for my lung to start expanding again and there's just been it's improved by leaps and bounds and all the chemotherapy side-effects are totally gone you know I sometimes I'm going through my day doing the normal things of life and I can't believe that I feel normal and that I've I have food cravings that I'm hungry I haven't had not had that in almost two years a year and a half to two years I had not felt normal in many of these areas and I just thank God for his beauty and for His grace to me and I know that he extends it to anybody else who believe it's work [Music] you
