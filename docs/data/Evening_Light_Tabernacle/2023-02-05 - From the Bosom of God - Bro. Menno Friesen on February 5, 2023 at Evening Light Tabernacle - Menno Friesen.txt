a they came and visited our church and were given a prayer cloth to take back home and [Music] there's a young man there 17 years old who's in the ICU in a coma after being in a very significant car accident and several I believe another one that was injured and they've been laying that prayer cloth on him and believing for a healing asked that we would remember that need in prayer this morning and also we have a prayer request for a church in South Africa brother Gideon ratif is a pastor he had a heart attack while he was traveling caused an accident and he has passed away from the heart attack and his wife is hospitalized so the church and the family just needs a real wrapping of the love of our Lord Jesus around them and that's what I want this morning for us to just say Lord wrap your arms around me and draw me close to you and amen if you have a need you just want to lift up to him as brother Daryl comes nothing is impossible for him amen amen amen we have a God who is able amen he's looking for Faith this morning that's what he come for he come to see do we believe so let's take our needs and let's go before him he's already provided so let's go to him now our heavenly father Lord we come to you father not as one foreigners or whatever but we're Sons and we're Believers father our faith this morning is in you and you alone father there's nothing else that can change things there's nobody else we can go to father but to you Lord so we come this morning with our hearts Lord Set On You Lord our faith Anchored In You And in the promised Lord for you are the provider of every need your Jehovah Jireh this morning to us father and we come Lord these needs have been read across this desk they may seem great Lord in the eyes of the world or unbelievers they may seem impossible but this morning Lord we realize there's nothing impossible for you for this one that's in ICU those that have been injured Lord in the accidents father I pray in the name of Jesus you'll come down in that room right now father and you would just come by their way Lord and sweep through father heal them father I pray that you would bring healing to those Lord those that have lost this loved one Lord this congregation in South Africa father I ask that you would be the comforter today Lord that you would go by their way Lord and just bring a comfort Lord and a peace to them Father we ask it in Jesus name for every hand it was lifted here for the needs father Lord we bind together as Believers and we're believing Lord even in this service that you'll come by and you'll answer father we believe that in Jesus name we're asking now we're calling on Your Name Lord we come Lord for one purpose that is to worship the most high God so we come this morning and doing that father we're inviting your presence Lord asking you to come by our way and anoint us Lord for service to you that you would anoint our faith Lord that we could claim every promise that we have need of we ask Lord for your presence every song that's sang Lord every word of the minister that would you would put it upon his heart father and he would reach out to the very needs Lord that we're crying out for in our hearts we ask this this morning Lord in Jesus name we thank you for it and we give you praise Lord thank you Father it's good to be here with you I was out Wednesday traveling and just good to be back we had a wonderful service last weekend there were a few things that for the sake of time last weekend that we didn't make some announcements but there's a few things that the deacons have that I wanted to make mention of this morning and ask that you would just be mindful of them one of the things is I want to encourage everybody to get to church on time we've you know we've had um instances where you know there there are things Wednesday nights you know we have it at seven some people will work until you know five or six and they have to eat supper and then get here so we understand Wednesday nights are a push for some but Sundays you know it's it's a day that we set aside for worship and so we should make every effort to get here on time to give God honor so it'll allow you to get here prepare yourself for the service you can pray read your Bible we consider on time 30 minutes before service not 11 o'clock so we're asking everybody to be mindful of that and just prayerfully uh come in and prepare yourself I believe you'll see the result in your life that God will honor that he'll honor your um you know that you would give honor to him so I believe it will please the Lord Jesus if we can do that so the other thing is our Nursery we have a lot of new uh moms dads and so just wanted to kind of go over some of the things there um it's not a play area you know as some people think well a nursery is the place to take your kids put them down let them run around get um you know but what it should be used for is take your baby there to be nursed diaper change get them settled down and then come back in to the service so we've got two we've got one that you she can take the children who are misbehaving maybe they're interrupting service you need to take them out so there's a nursery for that and then the other side the nursing mothers can go in and take care of their babies change diapers so neither of these are a place to visit we want we want you to go in there and it be a place where somebody's in there and they can steal we've got monitors the services going on so we want you to treat that like the sanctuary and keep that a place where worship can still occur not with the kids running around so we just ask you to do that and you know make that a place to take your children attend to their needs and then come back into the service so obviously you know you can stay in there and see the monitor but it's not like being here and it's kind of like streaming you know it's uh it's good but it's not like being here so we just want everybody to do that and just ask that y'all would would do that and God bless you this morning we're looking forward to a wonderful day of worship God bless you amen turn around tell your neighbor I'm happy to be here this morning Brothers can take up the offering hey man let's sing that song I'm on the battlefield for my Lord amen [Music] well I'm on battlefield for my Lord yes [Music] [Music]

David said surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my my life and I would dwell in the house of the Lord forever to think of it Lord as a psalmist would say it to follow after it means to chase after and overtake Lord when we were unlovable you loved us when it looked like we were unsavable you saved us your mercy ran over us and after us and overtook us Lord we thank you to be surrounded for that Mercy today Lord as we stand here today and just worship you and thank you Lord we worship you thank you Lord for the life of brother Gideon retief that ministered Faithfully

amen God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord together today and amen we're welcome each one of you that has come and we have a special guest with us today um we have brother minnow Friesen his wife also back there God bless you Sister the reason it's so nice to have you here they're they're from way up North too and a little bit they're doing a little bit of snow burden I know what they're doing coming down soaking up a little sunshine and a little warmth and amen we we thank the Lord that our Reign and things has passed that we've had in the last few days and we can enjoy this kind of weather and it can be a blessing to them too amen but we also um I just want to introduce our brother minnow brother minnow who's been a pastor for many years up in Saskatoon um Saskatchewan Canada and we've known him through the years and he's been always uh been a good really good friend that we've learned to love and appreciate and you told me earlier last year back in the summer and then again in the fall that they would be making a sweep down into this area and so they're traveling through and we're just really happy to have them some of you will remember the the Believers group let's see how many remembers the Believers group okay that's quite a few hands out there you're famous brother minnow he was a part of that group and so you know he is uh here going to sing a couple of songs for us this morning and we're and then of course bring the word of God to us and we want to just say we really appreciate our brother you're going to hear from the Statesman this morning amen and it'll be a blessing to you I know amen someone have you be seated so he can come and and give you his greetings and sing God bless you brother minnow thank you for being here amen God bless you I'll use this man I'm happy to be here it's a it's a long waited time we've wanted to come here a long long time but uh it's uh it pays to start your car in the morning to get here it uh It's a Long Way South and uh but I did uh on the way down from Texas coming through here we did see some of our friends the snow geese and the Canada's were eating on the field so we kind of waved at them welcome so now we know why they always come this far south and uh part of uh part of Canada's here my word I seen there are they migrating this way for the winter I think they must be they must be it's good to see all of you and it's always nice to see the elect lady I uh I feel that way there's none like her uh I kind of feel that way about my wife and Irene by the way is her name if you didn't know and uh but uh we all feel that way and I'm glad he feels that way about us when I heard this last song it just blessed my heart to realize that we weren't running after him he came looking for us we didn't even know that we were in fact if we were honest most of us were running from the presence of the Lord but God rich in Mercy in fact it's that's the one message the first one I heard brother Brown speak in 1965 running from the presence of the Lord when I was in Jeffersonville Indiana and when he preached the marriage divorce series I was blessed and privileged to be there for the series and uh the night when we walked into the Tabernacle the evenings Wednesday night and I heard brother Brown take his text running from the presence of the Lord and by that I'm already I had already quit running I had found the presence of the Lord and that's what I believe the species means to all of us we are honored and so blessed to know that that you can drive hundreds and thousands of miles and maybe find one here one there one there and there's the prophet sang that song so many times they come from the East and the West they come from the lands of Fire and there's here and there we'll think of how many churches we pass not because they're bad people they're wonderful people but blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your years for they hear and your hearts that can believe the very impossible of all times we're expecting the greatest event the greatest expectation lays in this closing seventh age that there's going to be little men and women walk off of the earth without dying it's only been heard a couple of times and done singularly Enoch had the privilege a few of them and uh but we all we know all those stories and they're so wonderful but now we are the last part of the Great puzzle of God and the last few pieces are put together I'm just so glad to be a part of that I'm just a part of you a part of the family of God give me that I'll try to sing this song you know how do you I'm more Infamous than famous I'm we're we've we did sing years ago and I say this humbly 19 and 70 and you know some of our good friends Brother Gary Brother Gary and Sister Barbara and Sandra sitting with them we uh they yo there's nothing like old friends and overestimated we're over 50 years ago when we met them first and uh brother Barney at that time and we preached in that area in the church and God called me to preach in 1970 and brother Tim and I have actually something very much in common we've both preached about 52-53 years now but he's a little younger than I am I started later I started when I was 28 and God called me and it's been 50 to 53 years and just this uh this December now my wife and I've always said you know when we ever if we ever retire now preachers don't retire they just slow down and I said if we ever get to the place to where we retire I'd like to take and when we go to Tucson and then go on down Phoenix Tucson and then go east as long as we feel I can at least to Louisiana and then maybe head upwards so that's what we're doing here we're just kind of driving feeling and doing and doing this which makes me I didn't really want to Preacher Brother Tim would have been preaching out of and felt way better but I but I would uh but I want to kind of uh put my liquefier with yours and uh and if you know the song There is a source if you know the words on it if you put it up on the screen [Music] there is a source in time of name give me strength brings me peace in every tribe through every test My Savior stands in my defense so when the road is rocked leaves you tired and warm all your strength is gone and your heart feels torn thank you remember God is greater than the storm take courage for the battle is the Lord when the waters rise calls my name and bits me come out on the waves he holds my hand lest I should falter and makes me stand out on the water say it with me when the road you want leaves you tired and warm and your strength is gone and your heart feels torn remember God is greater than the storm take courage for [Music] take courage for the battle of the Lord there are two you can take one by side and one by faith oh take the word of God or what you see what do you believe is what will be so set your wings to The Winds of Faith you can fly fly to a higher place do not struggle it's my grace set your wings to the Wings of Faith and what's your name and what's your cry watch your mountain is it much too high then you speak the word of God and by and by it will improve who are you alive so set your wings to The Winds of Faith you can fly to a higher Place do not struggle for it's my grace set your way s through the winds watch the Eagles in the sky [Music] struggle and it doesn't strive for the power that makes him rise is already in the sky or set your ways to The Winds of faith [Music] to a higher place do not struggle it's my grace [Music] set your wing to The Winds of Faith oh do not struggle for it's my grace set your wings to The Winds of faith foreign let's pray father we thank you so much this great work that you've begun we feel so blessed to be living in this day in this hour seeing the Great Book of redemption begin to close now and seeing all the elect waiting that they without us are not made perfect they're waiting on this last bride to reach that position that place and your great economy a father to where you'll call and we answer thank you Father for your grace this morning we thank you for this Resurrection morning we've come here not to run a program or system but to glorify your worthy name to build our hearts and our hopes on nothing less than Jesus blood and his righteousness take both the speaker and the hearer under your control what is given to us to speak but also to hear granted Lord as you get glory and praise in our service this morning bless this assembly the pastors the ministers the deacons the trustees all of the labors around here many have driven miles to get here this morning God I pray you'll bless them and may they be just a little higher when they leave here today and said it was good to be in the house of the Lord because of your presence we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can be seated I'll lay this one down thank you God bless you so much and I'm grateful I'm grateful to be here again today and I want to say this one more time that uh it's a it's a one time it might never happen again but I'm so glad to be here today and to get to meet you and and uh anytime when you I've always said this if you run out of who to pray for and I have my name crosses your mind pray for me I think it was so many times people have prayed for me I think how many times I prayed for others you ever notice how sometimes when you're just not thinking about anything you're just praying for somebody else and names start coming to your mind and names that I couldn't remember if somebody would ask me but the Lord begins to I like it when I get alone somewhere you know just away from everything driving my car names start coming I take advantage of that because they don't want to forget the names I can see their face to face now I know your face but the name but God bless you all and I love it I'm a little bit loud up here am I scaring you I'm going to try and be quieter but I I want to just share just a just a little bit before I uh I I don't know how long you have your services here but are you you're like brother you're like brother Harold they asked him one time about um Pastor said how long do you want me to speak oh he said I believe in the message of the hour so he was in the he was in the message so we'll do it somewhere within the hour no I I don't we know God's not a god of time we're people of time and uh I realize sometimes time is of a great Factor because um I remember one time my background was German and but really more Dutch than German we were in Germany and we came we'd taken a train my wife and I and everything's punctual in Germany they say exactly what they mean so we were we were coming into this one port and and uh the train was coming in and just outside of the city it stopped we thought well we're not there yet we're not and we looked at the time it is about two minutes too early exactly the time exactly when the when the clock we rolled in he stayed right outside I thought well now that's uh going a little far now that's close I mean uh but but you know we serve a god that is exactly the word he's not almost the word of God he does not almost mean what he says he means exactly what he says why wouldn't that be something where we could take him just that way exactly for what he said now I know we always and I'm not looking down on you I said oh I wish I could believe exactly just the way he said it because he's never had to change his word one bit of all of the ages and the science and the re the the minds of men have reached now disguised to where they're beyond almost Beyond human of what they're creating well they are because they're eating of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil but it's got death in it but God's word has no death in it except to the ones that reject the word then they're already dead Jesus talked about said they were already dead while they're living here in pleasure said they're already dead that's the reason how you can go by places and see things and churches and and religious orders and so on dead while they're living but life isn't measured by maybe say excitement or a noise but yet it's a part of it it's you know like I kind of like to say it the way the prophet said he said now let the stimulation come from the labor relation not the other way around get a revelation from the stimulation but I believe the simulation that comes from Revelation that stimulates us when the word of God is revealed to you personally then you know that you have passed from Death unto life that is God's way of doing things I like the way he operates don't you he's not you don't have to wait for me and I don't have to wait for you he reveals himself to whom he will and when he does no one can take it from you if God ever reveals to you like your pastor here I've heard him lots of times I've logged into this congregation but now see you face to face so it's good and I've heard the different Brothers brother Kelly uh he's up there uh right well he's in the church that I used to be in and it doesn't sound good does it I didn't leave him it was during the time when there was some storms passing through and uh but it almost you know almost blew all this what storms do sometimes it rolls all the chaff away and then it comes back to the reality again and the Brother Kelly's doing a wonderful job by the way brother Tim brother Dwayne Fair who is my son-in-law married Carney and he is now just he's become Pastor as of January the first so I'm now a free-floating uh radical you know what is so I'm I'm just taking my time and I don't have to get up I don't have I put all the burdens to him all the prayer requests and uh which is not that easy we always do pray but he said his greetings this morning brother Dwayne said his greetings and he said they went to hear brother Timothy who was at Brother Kelly's Church they went to hear him Friday night and said he to preached a tremendous message that's what he told us so we're glad I know they're happy over there and of course every year when brother uh Spencer and brother Tim come to Edmonton or to Brother Kelly's we uh we take in at least a couple meetings so so we always uh I know where he stands on the word of God blessed be the name of the Lord God and I'm so glad just let me just make a few comments here before I turn to the scripture and um I I usually don't preach too long but uh not that I run out of words to say uh you know how it is you know what the word of God is that way they're just when you start into something have you ever noticed as a Christian you know sometimes you just don't know exactly where you want to read so you open your Bible and you start reading and you know more two or three verses you say oh that's exactly what I needed that why that why why should I haven't read that before you have but we forget but it's the way of the spirit he knows you know he knows how to give you exactly what you need might be just one little part that doesn't connect with the other it could be this morning it could be maybe tonight or whenever the spirit of the Lord moves in strange ways but coming here to this Shreveport area I remember and I might not just say this is a joke or as a a bit of a tense part but Back in 1970 71 we were here with brother Perry Green in Shreveport and we came to the Tabernacle uh brother Jack Moore that brother how many knows brother Jack Murray well you know of him because brother Graham talks about constantly I think some of the greatest and uh you know towards the end brother Jack was always the kind that said brother Adam come preach what's up in your heart I don't know if he ever really saw the word completely but I know he said he enjoyed to have the Prophet come there because it was a powerful reality behind it but but let God do it we're not we're not judges we're Fruit inspectors so but I just let it go and God didn't call us a judge he said no the fruit's rotten said don't eat it so whatever it is but we're not judging but in the church Brother Moore come up that night and he was introducing us and brother green and and uh so he he had never met us before and we were we were nine of us there um you know all the musicians and and by the way the Believers were nine nine of us were first cousins from three families and uh the Doles freezing said freezing so we we we were singing together just like you do here in the church born Holy Spirit we had a great Revival and and uh 60s and into the 70s when the message began to come our way and uh of the one village where brother Kelly is still the pastor there of that local place where where God sent the Revival back in 1961 from actual 1957 to 19 uh 1665 when brother Graham died but in 1957 brother Ram came to came to Saskatoon and it was the first time I ever sat in his meetings I was 15 years old and like I said the other day when we were I I was 15 years old I was like most of you boys are 15 years old and you probably won't remember what I said but you remember the girl that was sitting over there and there now you know what I'm saying and I that's not what I was I didn't I don't know if I heard what brother Graham said but I was there so let me just put it that way I was there if you the only way I know what he said is I go listen to the tape but uh and but in 1965 when he preached the marriage divorce I was already married I had two children and uh and the holy I was filled with the Holy Ghost and it was one of the things that that was so precious to me when I heard Brothers speak those messages but when we were here and with the Believers we got introduced then Brother Moore uh Hebrews uh not reluctant but he but he kind of said well now these brothers will be singing today he said now they said now personally said I don't I don't know this is I heard it he said I don't really believe brother Ram was Malachi 4. and uh said I believe he's a man of God but I I do not and brother green was there he's going to tell all the testimony about how how the angel of the Lord met the prophet and what he did in decision and we were going to get up there and sing Seven Stars in the hands of Jesus the messenger that came William Branham was his name we're gonna sing all those songs and I thought oh my now he said he doesn't believe this message and he's the pastor here that didn't make us feel he didn't want to make us feel unwelcome he just that's just what he said at least he was honest you know and he said he didn't believe it and so then they introduced and I came and he said now you you introduced the brothers so I did and I said now we're going to have I hope we don't have a problem here today because I do believe that brother Ram was the angel of Malachi 4. but I said to you know to to stall the argument uh you know let's not fuss about something that's in the distance I said now if if we've seen something like look like a horse or might be a moose if you're in our country say no that's not a horse looks like it's a moose whether we can fuss all we want but I said why don't we just keep on walking and we keep on walking and when we get when it comes clear said I can look at you and you can look at me and say hi we don't have to say anything do we I don't have to say I was right and you were wrong I don't even say that just keep on walking and I say this to the local assembly and you're a good pastor here it's good to keep on walking what we don't see today just keep walking this is a continual unfolding light there are things that I I wouldn't go back to 20 years 30 years back I'm walking in this light this is this is light to me I'm not trying I'm not waiting for something new I'm walking in what is the the light of God it gives light wherever it shines so walk in the light and and God bless you I know that but as Hebrews says you know not laying again foundations of different things but let's go on to Perfection like like matured if we were talking about maturity we know what we're talking about this is the age of all maturities this is the age of the the Satan's Eden it's it's maturing he's he's got a real Eden here you watch the watch the things that he's doing yeah he's got him a kingdom that he's not wanting to give up he's he's planning on living here a long time but already notice has been served him already of eviction we know that thus saith the Lord that he will not be able to finish this Kingdom he won't be staying here long he might inhabit it for about a half hour an hour but that's all he's got and because there's there's a little honeymoon while that's going on and there's a bride coming back to live here for a thousand years by God's grace I want to keep on walking walk from that Dimension to this Dimension I believe that's why we're here this morning that's what everyone is desires that's why we preach that's why we talk that's why we encourage that's why we stand and try to say don't give up just and it's not you giving up anyhow I kind of like one Satan and brother Brown makes I kind of you know we all have favorite brother Brian said at one time and and remember I'm not quoted exactly but someone said oh I'm trying to hold on I'm trying to hold is that hold on nothing he said he's holding on to me and you're saying that I kind of like that song you know we you try to say oh I want to hold on to the Lord look you've already made it if you're in Christ you're already with him seated with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now and now are you the sons of God now you're the daughters of God you might not even be filled with the Holy Ghost but if it's the seed of God in you it'll quickly you'll keep leading you to justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost fill you and keep on right on moving come on right on walking just like you say whoa I wish I was you know when you're when you're 15 you want to be 18. when you're 18 you want to be 20 21 when you're 21 you want to be 18 again no I mean but you know it doesn't take very long you get past the places oh would it be nice to be 25 again yeah yeah with that I think oh I'm so glad he took a picture of us when we were 20 21 like that some of us got some real good friends across the other side you know I'm almost saying this respectfully and I do say there's almost more people on the other side already that is on this side I've seen a whole generation of Believers that believe this message pass away and whole age I think in our church there's probably one my aunt is living she's 93 I believe right now she's still living and that's the only one that I remember of the village there were Brother Kelly's the pastor of the church that still is of the stock that was first born into the messages and lives today now the rest are all new converts and we're so glad I wish I'm glad Jesus didn't come when when the prophet when he took the prophet now we we was there so we're really hoping that that would be the end of it we we believed it would be yeah uh I I just might as well confess it I said I was one of them there and I believe with all my heart that that there's going to be a Rapture right then and uh but it didn't come then foreign but it's on its way we live and we breathe with everything that we do and I'm trusting even here that you understand it's not trying to put a scare on people I do not believe that Christian is going to be scared uh you know because we were just simply experiencing the reality of the entire scripture because this is a book of life that was written by God himself but penned by men but God wrote it himself in every line and every verse speaks of him the the One Singular part of the whole book is that our Lord is one Lord but but he has many attributes and we've seen him unfolding unfolding as we're seeing at you but but even taking the messages like the prophet said about watch the two Vines how they've come together till now but the two Vines have been growing been growing the the fruit is there and now we're seeing the maturity of both of them not just one not just Satan's Eden I've given I've given Satan a little Glory there but he is Satan can only operate where God allows them to our praise he is not above God he has no no authority over God God still holds him exactly remember the scripture Isaiah 45 is there evil is there Wicked and the Lord hath not done it all the things that are on the earth that give him gave him reason and power of being what if there was no sinner he'd not be a savior what if we weren't born in sin there would be no Redeemer but the great author he knew from the beginning he didn't say oh I choose this or not choose that one oh no he knew who was in him then and my little thought this morning if I would I'll just move on to that and I want to I it's just been lately it's been been uh kind of pounding on my heart and from the bosom of God I read a little partner brother Ram talks about you know the uh Dew Drop and uh he he takes a little time and goes through and said how the Dew Drop said said oh and said and it's born in the middle of the night in darkness now just consider yourself where were you when I born in darkness in sin come to this world speaking lies and just but just as soon as the Sun starts coming up we begin to shiver we begin to take a different attitude or something we wanted to get back to where we were from what's the desire of you here this morning you get back where you came from where you really came from which I'm the son of son so I'm the son I yeah we have natural parents but if you're a Son of God and a daughter of God you are the Eternal attribute of God loosed upon this age delivered upon the stage to Bear out and and bear out the works of God the seed of God for you are the living epistle that's been written by God and now made manifest you didn't live in Luther's age I didn't live in wesleys they joined Pentecostals I didn't even live in Pentecostal age I came in under the message of this age when I came to the Lord it was in the message and I remember my parents they were they were they come out of Mennonites and then went into Pentecostalism then into latter rain but while in later rained they were beginning to they were thirsting for God and in 1957 when brother Ram came through Saskatoon it was a time of confusion in our area and uh but from that time I'd say this humbly from that time my dad was determined he took the tapes and order the tapes whatever he could in the books that they were available and in our home the influence of this message started in the July of 1957. my dad took the books home and began to read them and I remember you know Prophet visits South Africa a man sent from God and there was a couple of Judah status books that we got along the way but as he started reading them and uh my dad is still read German Luther's Bible and uh so when he when he'd read the Bible he still read but he started reading English because he's starting to read Brothers books so he's kind of learned English he only had a third grade of English so he started reading and as he started reading I still remember just being a young boy sitting at the table he he'd stop once in a while and said my he said this reads just like the Bible said this accident looks just like the Bible like the prophets of old we didn't even know he was a prophet at the time but it was it said just and he said well I think he kind of felt like that sometimes people say oh you're off the word oh it's not right it can't be that he said well I'll just stay with this till that comes then yeah so we just stayed with it and come to find out one day the Lord began to open up say oh truly this was that Elijah that was to come and I thank the Lord and we like men like that so sometimes maybe it's huge just stay with it if you've got a little light walk in that light don't be envious of somebody else's life there's plenty for you there's plenty pleasure I like this the song room room yes there's room there's room at the fountain for me I want to take a real read a scripture here I'm I'm already um I didn't finish what I wanted to say there but I want to I want to finish it now when brother Brown makes that little comment about the little message I think it's called my commission and uh he talks about he talks about the little uh you know the Dew Drop and he said then as the sun begins to shine said maybe it's hanging on the line or the clothesline he said but as the drop is formed and then it begins to shiver he says and it makes a statement said why is it shivering said it's longing to go back where it came from and uh I want to take and read up read that part maybe that quote you know how it is I think there's nothing like when the prophet quotes something uh it always feels good so you don't mind if I read that pardon me I'm not sure you I'm used to writing things down but but he talks and takes the thought there and I just finding a little a little uh I can't find it right here now but let me just try foreign yes sure it is let me just finish that well how he says it he said now he said it's it's there that's the same thing with with the new birth he talks a little bit about he said now it Sparkles and it longs to go back said it wants to go back to where it came from and uh said now that's the way it is with the new birth we go we never go back we go forward and when you're born again that's why I think today we have so many uh not so many rather genuine new births is because the seed maybe will sympathize with the word or person but they don't want to rot away from the old system that they were in they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old system and claim the new birth or the message of the age we found that under the Luther Wesley Pentecost and the others they tried to hold on to the old system and claim this but the old system age must die rot in order to bring forth New Life say to bring forth new life and I I think that is so beautiful he said now watch that little thing he said now when it's back there but just let the sun shine out one time did you notice and I say this just let the s-o-m shine on a real predestinated heart one time just let the sunshine did you notice a habit gets and I believe in being happy but that's not what I'm what that's not I'm not happy to get a revelation I'm happy because I got the revolution from God he said it's just Quivers listen scriptures why it knows it's the sunlight is going to draw it back to where it was from the beginning and so is every man and every woman that's born of the spirit of God there's something about it when light spreads over us that they're happy because they know they're going back to where they come from from the bosom of God not from a church not from a community not from a certain area a certain Society but from the bosom of God when Jesus is on Earth he constantly referred to it I come from God and I go back to God I and my father are one he and never said he never talked about anything he said the son could do nothing and we look at the sovereignty of God how can he walk into a church how can he walk into a building of 500 people and he'll want and walk away when he had power by get when he had all powers given to him on Earth in heaven but he said he did nothing now I said earlier I said what is it if we could just take what God said if God said go take one out of him there that one's just laying over there he's not really sick anybody always too slow go pick that one up and take him out it doesn't say anything about when you read the scripture where Jesus stopped and they looked at this one and looked at that one discernment he just took the one and walked out Sovereign Grace we sit here that way this morning Sovereign Grace it's God's grace that has brought us here it was us they were sitting there and we often tell this how many people were sitting beside you when the same word was preached but something struck in your heart and said that's for me that's for me in my house James if you have your Bibles James puts a little that I would like to draw from if I could and the second chapter of this is often just going to pick on a little an old familiar I'm sure your pastors the devil the brothers here preaching on this often and it's a good one he died he separates works and Grace and puts them all together Works does not discharge grace and grace does not discharge works and he puts them all together James the second chapter is so beautiful at that and the prophet is preaching on this and he and he reads the scripture of course and uh I'd like to read it with you if you would it's James the second chapter but let's start around the 14th verse and just get the the background of it so what does it profit my brethren though a man May have say he has faith that have not works can Faith save him they say oh wait a minute I thought we're saved by grace we are we are but watch how high he puts it together I was like the way he doesn't leave any questions what does the prophet do our brethren though a man say he has faith and have not worse can Faith save him if a brother or sister is naked now watch and destitute of daily food now that's just not natural that's spiritual and one of you say unto him depart in peace and be warned and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which is needed to the body what does it profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yeah and a man say that thou has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy words and I'll show thee my faith by my horse thou Believers that there is one God that do as well the Devils also believe in tremble but it's a good thing to believe that there's only one God you can't get anywhere else beyond that if you if you if you have more than one God we're heathens now he's gotten many attributes and we won't go into that you've got a good you've got a teacher here so I won't even try that but that no vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abram Our Father justified by works when he was offered up Isaac his son unto upon the altar see us now then how Faith was wrought by works with his works and by works was made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled with saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God so he ye see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only life was also was not Rahab the heart of justified by works when she had received the Messengers and had sent them out another way look at the simple attribute that she had but where did she get it from it was revealed to her that these were men of God for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also let me just if you would bow just for a word of prayer I want to read a prayer for the church that brother Brown preached that he prayed when he preached the message of token I just blessed me so much a while ago when I read it and I want to read it to this Tabernacle because I will I would believe it's meant for you and for me brother van bow prayer and he says this Lord by your grace your help I claim everyone that's Heir that hears this message I claim them for you God I pray thee Lord both here and this message where it goes and those that hear it on tape and if there be a seed anywhere that's predestined Lord to hear the word of this last day may they come now sweetly and humbly and lay their trophies down at the cross or their selves as trophies of the grace of God that's called them and may they be filled with the Holy Ghost and display the token of the life of Jesus Christ in his resurrection as long as they remain here on Earth granted Lord these words Lord I may have not said them just right but if I didn't I pray that the holy spirit will take those words and present them the way that they should be presented that the people may understand and know without malice and let them know that love is corrective and that they might know that it's because of the hour that we're living in and the close coming of the Lord that we see great red lights flashing everywhere all over the world that the time is at hand May the people receive the Holy Ghost this day I pray and present them to you in the name of Jesus Christ and let it be a token to us as long as we live which you promised to be it's as easy as to ask because you promised it so it's easy for me to ask you Lord because you promised it and I know it will because you said it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen I I've wanted to read that for you because I do believe that's exactly my prayer I do believe that we're in that kind of an hour and may I just take a little part of this thought because as uh we all understand God gives us times and reasons and purposes but I want to just take this a little part and read out a little message called birth pains and two two little places here this morning I would like to read as quotes and pardon me I just read that from birth pains I wanted in Christ is the mystery of God revealed a very common a very common and very much preached so a message that we have that we have so loved and often quoted from and and brother Bram so makes known how that we are now in the age and the hour where God has opened up his complete mind and let us know what was in his mind before the foundation of the world we've often went across those things and just rejoiced them because for the first time we understand the things that that for the last 50 years we've been walking in the light of the open Word now it hasn't all been revealed to us personally and it comes gradually but uh it it is it is part of God's word and he has made it known that the Bible is the expression of the one gold that God had and our purpose he wants to achieve what he's had and then let me just now I chose you and reveals that that the Bible the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ and the entire Bible is an expression of the one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in type all the acts now just let your mind go then just begin to take some of those in which we won't take long a long time on that but we that's what we have Labor for every time we pick up a character we go to something else and next time you pick up different characters in The Bible and oh how it becomes real when you begin to deciphon you know it's the acts of the Believers that believe the message for that day and they acted out they were they were the word they became the Living Word God's always had skin on God's always had flesh around him he works he works through the to the vehicle of humanity what do you think let me just drop in there just I would say this is I not the Lord but we always say oh Lord give me more of you give me more of you oh fill me a new filming Lord make me so full of the Holy Ghost that I know Earthly good what would it be like if you were completely full of the Holy Ghost in every fiber of your being you would be no earthly good you wouldn't need a wife you wouldn't need a husband you wouldn't need children you wouldn't need any you you would just be so yeah you would just not why would plow the field why plant you speak the word why go through anything but see God gives us just enough of him to live here in this place in this body to love to live to grieve to pain to feel all these things and to know and to and to act out the attributes of God just like he has from the beginning he's the author of Love he's the author of pain he knows what pain is like he knows what it's like to be without why does he keep calling us why does he goes around the world and calls it he loves Fellowship that's one thing he was born in he why did why do you think why do you have a wife why do you have a bride now why my wife we're talking about being old now we're getting old and and uh we look at something he said ah it's too late to said well maybe we should fix it out nah it's too late um you know well we should maybe get this ah you know but I haven't got the energy I just turned 80 this year so it's a little different I never knew what somebody's asked me so why do you want to resign his Pastor said have you ever been 80 before no no okay when you get there then let me know it slowed down a little bit but I said you know what I want to stay with my wife as long as I'm here it's just the company the fellowship we've done well we've married 60 years this year and so we were counting back you know how we go back and we go back and we look back and say we and we'll come all the way back here to to Shreveport and we come to step into Gary and Barbara's Home and it's like home away from home Sandra's filling us all in and all the latest you know and telling she's got all the names and she she remembers the names we don't remember the names and and Barbara knows all the people and Gary's just standing there shifting gears good good old friends you know how it is but it feels good to walk in the house and just sit there with friends you can even talk about things that sometimes that's a little fishy so yeah but it's the principle of things don't ever be afraid to say well this this is off the word here this stuff if it's off the word get away from us and stay right with the word of God oh I'm so oh we should be so humble we should never talk about anything that oh and I want to talk about well our Lord wasn't that humble uh you know when they were there and around him and said ah this must be the devil working said well of course you said you're your father the devil if you were mine I said you'd believe me because my father wrote of me and the scripture declares who I am so he wasn't exactly oh what a gentleman he was yes he was a gentleman he know how to love like no one could he didn't know how to bear like no one could he know how to put up like no one is you you get sometimes said that's it I've had it whatever it is you know well he didn't do that when he said that's it I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna wipe them off I'm that's it I'm going to take care of them but you know what's ah wait a minute wait I remember Jacob no no no I can't destroy him I'll let him suffer but I won't I know I'll bring him back at the end no I can't destroy him he I promised Jacob I promised Israel how many times you know we get that way we get impatient and but but getting back to the thought if we were we God made us this way to have Fellowship and how God loves it just that's why it's not just in church we hear we come to praise and we worship you know I heard you're praising and and do the top of your lungs as you're coming in and worshiping what you believe is that God will accept it receive it because you you want him to you want to know how you feel you want to know that that I am a believer Lord and uh and we don't we we have a language that no one else has we don't have the devil's language say well I don't feel so good I don't know if I'm saved today or something that's the devil's language brother Brian said that's not God's language that's the devil's name said we speak those things where honorable truthful say I feel rotten today but I'm a son of God I don't feel like a Christian at all but I know I am I don't feel like getting up this morning but I'm getting up you're just throw in another shell you keep throwing another shell I do a little bit of hunting in my years now of course the only hunting I do now is in memory you know all those are good days oh those were good days oh how we did that oh how we did that and my guns are locked up in the in the case you know so it gets that way too finally finally you live a member but I'm glad I got a good I kind of like brother Ram said I I of all my pictures he said I'm glad they were made in Christ I'm glad I've been a Christian now for 50 well 60 years right when I was 19 I met my wife and the love of my life and we fell in love and it was there that that we realized both of us that we needed Christ well we were we're raised in Christian homes but but you know it's different to be raised in a Christian home than to be a Christian that when it comes in you then you begin to live out now say have you made mistakes oh I wouldn't want to go there have you come short every day David your backslid I'm going to say what the prophesied every day but he is not one moment that he has to stop being an intercessor Upon My Confession no matter how I feel how rotten we feel and sometimes I feel like totally unchristian and you made a mistake and you knew you made it and maybe you knew when you done but then I want remember I said but oh wait a minute where did I come from and where am I going back to I know I come from God and I'm going back to God I know that that I was in the bosom but God if I wasn't I never would have had eternal life but I know I've got eternal life because I believe the word for this age and I'm walking in it it's me I love it every part of it's me I'm glad to be a child of God in this age the darkest of all ages and the most deceptive of all ages now that's the one thing we don't want to get into this morning because that's the that's a challenge this is the this is the most deceptive age of all ages because Satan has had six thousand years of handling mankind he knows how to deceive just give him plenty everything they ask for give it to them that's a quick one that's what I say in all things of scripture when you hear the prophet he comes along and said but remember in all things if God blesses you thank him if God takes it thank him whatever you do always thank him because he knows what he's doing sometimes I've seen things that just impossible you think it's impossible for something good to come out of that you just said how in the world and you know what I'm talking about to some degree here in this Tabernacle with your Good Shepherd behind you how in the world sometimes think how can it be of God but God makes all things work together for good to them that love him and are called according to his purpose I don't know why Jesus had to die he could have had a different Plan of Redemption but he chose that plan we didn't choose it we didn't come here said I want to be a sinner our Sinners right be saved no we were born that way God designed it so he designed it so why do we hunger and thirst for God he designed it so you know the prophets that every man that's born of a woman thirsts after God but he doesn't know where he's at he doesn't know he goes to church and doesn't find him he goes to a religious order he goes to the Ballgame he doesn't find them but you just think look at all the entertainment this world's got what are they thirsting for what you are possessing this morning they're thirsting they don't know it if they knew what life you're possessing here today on that Eternal bosom of God Eternal seed of God that's there wouldn't be a place you wouldn't have to build this Tabernacle you couldn't hold them but God put skin around it and by doing that he hides it from the world God walking in Flesh on this Earth and they looked at him said looks like God Oh that's oh when he raised that oh my there's Lazar oh that must be God no no I look at who's hanging with look he goes it's has something to eat the Pharisees oh no no it can't be gone can't be gone now if God want to have that flesh around there they would have been identifying but God put flesh around his word and let you come short lecture be weak sometimes you struggle sometimes you think oh what Lord have I wasted my life have I wasted I've stood there now let's let's follow me a little bit 50 some years I was there the night when brother Ram died at the time and you mind if I testify a little bit but my little wife at the time we were married for three years and she loved me and she loved the Lord but she'd been raised a certain way you know we all are out of our Mennonite Baptist Pentecost whatever and she she had been baptized in the titles of the father son holy ghost from immersion and everything and she uh I'll say this she's a real Jewel knocked on but I told her I showed her in the scripture said now it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair she stopped cutting her hair that's wrong to wear pants that becomes to a man's garment and wear shorts and so she laid them aside not because she wanted to or because real to her but she did it because she loved me and she just did it because we it seemed like a good thing to do but the night that brother Brown died and I say this this is my testimony this is my and hers testimony the night brother Brian died we were at her parents Christmas Eve and the you know the humbug of Christmas and uh it's not a very good word to say humbug about Christmas but I like the real Christ math not not even Christ's Mass just Christ's birthday but the holiday is Pagan but not the birth of Christ isn't paid we have our different opinions at times and there's some people they just get all carnal others real spiritual but just leaving that and we were there and having a Christmas with the family and uh we got a phone call and my brother-in-law called me and he said and we had been there in February hearing the marriage divorce series now it's December the same year and brother Brian has just died and when the phone when the when the phone rang and called my name I actually my brother-in-law said he's crying he said brother Brahm has just died and so we said a few words and and I and we were about two and a half hours from home and where her parents lived so we said goodbye and uh then I told Irene and well you know I'll have to be honest Christmas is over for me then after about a little while I was trying to be a gentleman I said the family after a while so do you mind if I just slip out a little bit and I told her I said I need to go upstairs I need I need to pray and be honest and uh because I because we believed when God would take the angel that we were going with him let me clarify that a little bit all of you are very familiar with the first second and third poll but when brother Brown started preaching the third poor Ministry to some people it became confusing factors I've had men ministers tell me he said ah after he preached when he got there and started teaching the words that it just became confusing to me I I just I like the science and the American wonders just exactly what he knew would happen when he started preaching the third Paul you know what he says it's it's like getting settling down he talks about getting in the capsule he talks about buttoning down he says now remember it's out of your hands and I'm not going to preach around that but I just say that he said it's out of your hands now just sittle and sit down and buckle down he said he's going to do the rest of it and so we had all kinds of images of how it's going to happen you know we're we're human beings but we've got the Rapture all figured out sometimes and so wait a minute we got many things figured out we had kind of figured out that Jesus was coming now for his bride and I got such a burden because my wife wasn't saved I I believe it's just saved but I stood on later on she wouldn't be in the first resurrection the bride there's a difference of being saved and being the first blessed they have part in the first resurrection there are those that we know and that number is even given to where we don't even want to go there that's not our business some people have asked sometimes what do you think about that and say wait a minute that's not me I'm not in the tribulation period say what do you think will happen to the tribulation said I don't want to be here that's all I don't know I have no intention of being here during the tribulation period my my goal is set my hope is built well that night when finally in about an hour later she come up and I was already laying in bed I've been praying and uh and she got in bed and I put her arms around her we laid them I started talking I said honey do you know what this means this could be before another day or the next day or we don't know but this this could be anytime within 40 days they're gonna be a bride going is that all I want to do is I want to see you then I want to be there too we started talking we started praying and as God is my witness and I I hope I don't bore you with this part but you know we love those things when God does things you'll never forget them because they're they're that's my property we start praying and neither one talking we must delayed different hour just we couldn't pray because loud because we're in their home so we didn't want to disturb them too much and we're starting to pray and Connie was a little girl she had in the crib and she started fussing and Irene was going to get up but she she just felt no no just let her fuss well she she fussed a little while and then she stopped crying and while we're praying eyes closed dark in the room all of a sudden there's like I this is my testimony like a like a human form in front of my bed right in my feet like Satan would just standing there I didn't open my eyes and I'll tell you that honestly I was fearful I kept praying and all of a sudden as the as I kept praying all of a sudden I felt something and I noticed that my eyes closed now you know I sometimes light when your eyes are closed your Lids are still light it ain't in light all of a sudden that very figure was so black turned all white now I was afraid to open my eyes again for fear I'd see the angel of the Lord I kept on praying kept on praying finally but we I'd say about an hour and it quiet and we quietened down and I began to tell her I said honey you know what just happened and she said and when I told her she said that's exactly what I saw I saw the same thing and it became White all over it well we don't make anything of it it was just a visit whatever it was but something happened we were not home and I was working shift work for the company I was working for and and uh started at four o'clock in the afternoon and and uh so about three my wife fixed some lunch and getting me ready and I fix my lunch kit and so on she did I said she fixed my lunch kit if I would have fixed it it wouldn't be fair it'd be fixed all right I'll leave the cooking to her but anyhow she was doing some ironing after that and we were we I turned on the tape and we were listening to a part of the tape before I went to work and uh when I shut the tape off some of the members kind of fake it foggy but she said minnow said I have I have need to be re-baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and I knew right there that that she's not said much about that night but from that time we went to Jeffersonville in February of 1966 and she was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and from that time I didn't have to tell her to stop wearing pants and shorts and she always even didn't like the messenger too much because she was a little bit more educated than brother Brown's verbs and adverbs and some of them wasn't very you know you know how we are sometimes think oh he didn't say that quite right he should have said this way suddenly God even changed her understanding and and I say this to the glory of God from that time she had a personal identification and realized that her eyes would come open something I could not have done in fact when I was when brother Brian was you know in the marriage divorce series every time he he closes the meetings uh who is this Melchizedek and so on when he closed the meeting he always had a prayer and and uh my my brother-in-law we were five brothers that driven driven from Jeffersonville or from Saskatoon to Jeffersonville never crossed the border in our life for the first time we drove clear through in Minneapolis and on the way to uh Jeffersonville when we got over there we said we don't know Jefferson but we don't know anything about it and but I said I remember brother talks about New Albany Inn so we looked on the map went to New Albany there was then so we we booked in and and we were we had been driving for two days and two nights in the same clothes and uh the same hair good thing we had real cream in those days so you keep your hair down and and mine were still black then by the way hey they were still black every once in a while forget about that and then my wife shows me a picture I saw a picture the other day and had black hair I kind of feel like brother rabbit said wherever they were I'm coming back to them I believe we're coming back to them I believe we'll be young forever I believe that this is my story this is my song we're going to be young that what we feel now in our soul we know now it comes from somewhere that's eternal that comes from the bosom of God and is drip down here that's what God had in mind that's what he wants that's his whole purpose now you see it we love nice buildings and we too we built a new building but you know what it's all volcanic ash even these bodies but the soul it's eternal when we were in Jeffersonville and we we walked into the tap well well they they said the meeting starts on Thursday and so said uh we were all you know unshaven hadn't shaved for two days and I probably smelled like pole cats I don't know but but we was we was didn't even have a shot we said well he'd do that later or we don't have supper and then we'll tomorrow the service started someone said let's go find the Tabernacle so eighth and Penn so we looked it up on the map and we found drive up to the Tabernacle and there's cars everywhere all around the Tabernacle and uh we say oh it must be served well it was Wednesday night and here brother Brian was speaking so we'll walk to the door and the Deacon said there's no room said there's no room there's there's and oh we felt so bad said couldn't we put chairs in we put chairs everywhere there's nowhere we can get in and uh then one of the deacons came from the back said just somebody just been tapped him on the shoulder and he went out into the Tabernacle and he come back within a minute or so and said uh you know how many's been in the old Tabernacle all right well it's got you know the two aisles and then it's got the two doors going like that well as brother Brown was standing here the the aisle that came down that way right where you go out the Deacon said we're going to put five chairs there and you can sit there but when the meeting ends you've got to get up and uh so the Fire Marshall uh won't let you sit there once we stand because then people will leave and uh so we walked in Just The Way We Were and uh I had not maybe sat five minutes hearing brother Brown here or he was just taking his text running from the presence of the Lord he just taken this text and that's the last I remember about what I looked like what what I felt like didn't make it I would I think I probably cried right through the whole service I knew that God had given me Grace to see the angel of the message of the Covenant of God not the man I'm so glad God gives us the revelation of that it was the veil that covered the gift of God and the gift that's in you is the veil that covers you are sometimes a human what stumbles people many times is the Veil so how could this man he's such a man of God and then make a mistake like that doing things that be careful yeah this Bible tells it all brother Brown says what I like about the Bible it doesn't talk about just David how great he was tell us about the dirty laundry he had too tells about our life sometimes so many times oh I don't want I don't I don't hope that never becomes public right am I condoning sin non-belief never but we are I'll say this there is a fountain filled with grace no matter how low you get or how far you fall away if that seed lays there he is responsible to his own life he is responsible he's not even I can't keep myself you can't keep yourself but when brother bran preached that message there that did it for me and my brother-in-law as I said earlier uh he was sitting there and one night he said you know I I would like to show brother Graham to pray for me and uh and he said but I I asked some of the deacons said no brother Brian's not praying for everybody personally it's just a discernment said you have to wait on the Lord if he calls you then then that's the blessing you get well we prayed every night of course you know how it is like that's the night the second night where I prayed and I read it was praying for her I said now to my wife and I for my wife I should say I said Lord show her to me show me what will happen well he didn't you know God knew better might have might have done something I don't know what but my brother-in-law as brother but he watched the first night second night third night when he saw the way brother Billy would take brother Brown as soon as they start singing after the prayer discernment He Slipped him out to the side so my brother-in-law went and stood by the door and you brother REM had to pass by there and uh sure enough here come brother Brown Billy leading brother Branham and kind of Rush him out and brother Brown just walked right I was just walking through the be like my brother walked back to him just stopped and uh laid a hand on his shoulder and prayed exactly word for word what he was going to ask for the brown and he just walked out well when George George had tears of Sorrow before when he came out he said tears of joy he said it's over said it's lifted said I couldn't understand how this could have happened in my life there's something in his life he said I couldn't have couldn't believe that God could forgive that he said but he showed me that is greater is greater I think he run over some boys one time when he was younger he was a delivery man and two little boys dashed out of the road and uh he killed one of them and every time he would talk about that he'd be something changed in him you know he took felt like he'd taken the he should have been more careful your heart is blamed him and but he said that that night when brother Brian prayed when brother bam said that just prayed just about five words he just had a few words he said that's all he said and that from that time I knew God had heard my prayer he's a great God he knows how to handle sin he knows how to handle the works and put it together now we know when we really look at the scripture in which I'm I'm maybe just breathe just one more thing here but in all of the of all of the revelations of the entire mystery of Christ it has always God veiled behind flesh so much so that they were gods to the age the prophets were called they were the word of God to that age if this age could recognize that God himself was spoke again now in this last day not outside of the Bible but confirming the word didn't make a new Bible he remember how brother Brahma even says about the Seven Seals he's talking about him all the time he said oh it's not even written in the book it's the back side of the book it's not even written about the third seal he says wait a minute wait a minute and he starts correcting it has had been there all the time said but it was hidden from us well we wouldn't know what we wouldn't understand the voice of God in this age at all if if God hadn't opened our understanding and and hadn't fulfilled it but all of a sudden the word began to walk again on Earth in its fullness and this time we know there's not enough the message to follow there's not an eighth angel and you know that's been we've had all the doctrines around us we have a church splits and of every kind and we've got them still and we probably will have them till the day that we walk off of here but somebody is going to walk with off of this Earth one of these days somebody's gonna we're not all staying here no sir I like that somebody's leaving and I'd like even to take the first to second third exit the show brother Brian talks about the preachers of those messages that said to every believer that comes from the bosom of God that Faith produces the works of God if the seed that lays in you and I how can it disbelieve the word of God when it comes from the bosom of God how could you say oh I I well that was for yesterday impossible impossible the spirit of God does not deny his own word that's how you know you know sometimes people say oh well we better check out see if the prophet's right or not I I heard him say this I'm going to try and see if he's right or not the word comes to the prophets you want to find out if your Revelation is right go back to the word and say see if it fits together from Genesis to Revelations that's your Revelation if it doesn't and it says it's something different than what the angel said you'd read it again I'd encourage you to read it again because the word of the Lord comes to the prophet doesn't come to the teacher the pastor that sometimes we love great teaching but how great can teaching come when it starts leaving the word of God we've seen Great Men even around the species I'm talking Masters great understanding begin to take it and begin to move away just stay there where God said what he said whether whether we see it sometimes we don't see it happen we just wait a while but see what happens it brings forth this fruit for the for the word of God always brings forth the word the seed of the word for this age the message that this Angel spoke to us when he got to the third pool and they began to talk about they said well where's the sign that you used to have where's it he said it's still here then he would go and demonstrate it again said look show my hand it's still there see but he went further went on now to Perfection not another message you know he never went and you know he did correct some things along the way we know that like when he preached the Seven Seals he actually stops and said you know what I uh I I preached him all as being the white horse rider being Christ writing forth he said I took Larkins I took different ones and read him he's a man but God said now it won't work the time has come now said I'm going to let you correct that for the who could correct the heir of the Prophet only the god of the prophet because it must come to the prophet to be corrected sure sometimes we get stopped every people you know we ministers they get they give you questions you know how sometimes uh brother Brown will say things and he said now now you can be justified without being Sanctified you'll be Sanctified without the baptism the Holy Ghost well one brother showed me a quote and said now brother man what do you think what was happening he said you couldn't be Sanctified without being justified and he said nothing brother stops and said you can be justified without being Sanctified yeah but he said he said it here this way and now I said it here this way which is right I said you don't have to be a mathematician to figure that one out just the way it says now he he but he starts out saying you could be sanctified without being justified now that's not the scriptural but he corrects it immediately and says Ah he didn't say oh I was wrong he just said he quotes it again but this time he said you could be justified brother being Sanctified I said now that's that's I know I didn't want to hurt his feelings but I said now now that's just search the scripture what does it say take the whole path of God justification sanctification back from the Holy Ghost and even for the Holy Ghost himself now impersonating impersonating himself embodied because this time it's not an individual person that's leaving here it's the many membered body with the seed of God in them what a glorious light that you walk in this day I'm grateful to be walking this light I don't know if I if how long I'll be able to walk in this life but I but I but I don't regret a mind I don't regret the times I've had to stand there like you have done stood there and said Lord you said it I believe it that settles it just as sick as you were before God always lets us have something in our life that we that we need to hold to keep us humble even watch brother Branham home so many times I think of often I'd wondered why right at the end of his ministry when he when he when he got it revealed all the Mysteries and and uh and and he gets all worked up about how the people are not taking his message anymore he knows they won't but he feels so hurt that they rejected down rejected Christ and rejected the Vindicated word but he knows they can't believe Because unless they're in God's good and they can't believe it he knows that but we all know that too but we we preach and try to convince people anyhow but if the seed lays there it'll Quicken if it doesn't lay there you can pour as much water on there as you want it'll never come up again but it but it hurts and yet sometimes brother when I heard reading from the presence of the Lord are not not that one was where it talks about uh going up up to Alaska and you know tricking his wife to go with him and a human being a man just enough Veil to hide it from the wise of the prudent I heard a man say well you know in closing I say that heard a man say a while ago they were talking about brother Branham and he brought up and said he was talking about what a great man he was what a great ministry he had and uh he was a moderator and he's talking about oh I said there was never there's not a man that had a Ministry like William Branham he said and but as he went on he said and then we started teaching he said I said I believe that's why God took William Brown off the scene had him killed in the wreck so that he wouldn't be lost and I heard it and I thought oh my I don't understand why God like here we're talking about brother brother retief Gideon now why would God take a pastor out of a congregation and I know him real well I knew his mama and daddy both of them and and Andre and Linda and and I and God just pulled Gideon out let him die of a heart attack in the middle of the highway I don't understand it but that's not my business that's God's business there's a lot of things we don't we don't know but we're used to sing that song We'll understand it by and by but I'm going to say this it probably won't matter by and by it probably won't matter at all I said why did I have that why did my crop fail last year again oh my goodness well then I'm now you wake up on the other side and said okay what's the matter don't matter anymore now this crop will not fail this time there'll be no more Graves preached than when our funeral is preached I've preached of many a funeral at my age I've wept like a human being but I've rejoiced and all that many of them are planted in the name of Jesus Christ knowing they're going to come out in the first resurrection we'll stand here on Earth we'll be gathered with them here I believe you with all my heart somebody said is brother Ram come back absolutely he's one of the ages when he had that beyond the vision for him he said what the Lord told him said remember you're responsible for the message of this age you'll be gathered with your own I'm not ashamed to say that I believe that God sent an angel to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers where we know whether we come from the bosom of God and we're going back to the bosom of God when you brother the Bible says if you ever hear that that William Brown died he said don't you believe it that I've just changed the address now I feel the same way I've said that many times his funeral said no they didn't die they just changed the address the humanity is gone but their soul went on said ah finally would come to its rest the labors are finished God bless this Tabernacle this church I like that little prayer that brother Brown prayed may he bless it and keep it and when Jesus comes in the little Rapture now I know he appears before he comes this is his appearing but there is a physical physical coming where these bodies will have a Rapture too this body still Ages Every Day and if we don't meet again here there's one thing we do hope for and Trust for they're going to meet us young men young women in a body that can never never die here we've got no continuous City do you know what can I have the musicians come up and sing a song I don't know why but I just want to sing this world is not my home I'm just the passing through my treasures are lied up I don't know where they're laid out but I know they're laid up in the bosom of God I said how could we all come you know what's what it means it comes from the mind of God from the reality of God God spoke it and so it is we all knew that brother Timothy if you've still got a message you go ahead and finish it here it's been good for me to be here today and my wife and I we're traveling through I we're heading towards Ohio and Ohio has always been one of those places as well everybody has what we call special places and some of you people that come up from different places and the brother back there said I shook his hand said I said you don't belong here I said yes I do I came here about a year and a half ago or something like that he was a song leader in Cloverdale there in yes of course don't ask me the name of it but it's so glad to see and each of you that's been here that's moved here something drew you here we must believe that all of those steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord I remember when we had the great breakup in the in the in the over the Perugia Doctrine in our congregation and you know it's the hardest thing in my whole Christian walk that I've ever made a decision and I was given the opportunity I was given the ultimatum this this this and this or out you go and you know one of the things that came to my rescue I kind of like the way the brother Ram said my recipe what came to my rescue was the word of God and the pastor then God bless your soul I believe I'll meet him again in the Rapture but the doctrine had filtered into the church so powerfully that it just began to break it up and when they gave me the ultimatum of what to do either stay and get knocked down towards on or you can't preach you can't pray you can't sing you can't won't be supported I said I look gentlemen and the Holy Spirit come to my rescue and said Just remember this he said if the church called me then let the church take care of me but if God calls you God will take care of you he did he did I got kicked out but you know what not out of the Kingdom I'm still in the kingdom and you know what I found out he's never left me all the 35 years I've been 36 years of pastoring there and it was exactly if you you someday we'll one you understand but you we can't we don't have time but you know how you know God told you to do this go there and do that and you tried and it didn't work out said oh I can't be of God that's it all right thank you Lord but it is if it is of god sometimes there's a long way around do you remember brother brown with a tax case and everything and I said that he had been disobedient he says he said I practically I'm standing in the Pulpit right now with this over my shoulders he said I the Lord told me India not Africa or Africa not India remember that and he said I got to go make that thing right he said I got to get off my shoulder but then he looks back and he takes about the CAT tax case and he takes a whole circle and said you know honey I'm free remember when they paid off they got the bill in the loan so he said I'm free I'm free honey I'm let's go for a ride so they went driving he said I'm free and he looked back and said honey said for five years for five years I've wondered said but this day it's over sometimes it takes a while I've been there it took me five years I wondered I made a circle for five years I ended up in Ohio knew the Lord sent me there but it said for a year that I knew when he told me get out and go back five years amazing one day I'm sitting there reading that same message and we've just started the church in Saskatoon 1984. of April the 17th after we got put out and I read a little message and I counted back from April 79 to April 84. five years I said honey I'm free I've been the pastor there now for those years since 1984. and I don't know if I'm in the will of God now or not but Dwayne is the pastor there now it's been one of the hardest things to do at times you know how it is I don't want to fail the Lord but I do know this I get there was something come up and I gave it to commission to the Lord and I said Lord if you work it out I'll follow you you just leave me I know I could be gone tomorrow we know that already I'm living on board time but I thank him for all the time I don't regret a mile what was I going to sing that's it let's sing it with me give me a key if you will this world is not my home I'm just just the proof my treasures somewhere beyond the angels [Music] anymore [Music] [Music] [Music] father
