========================================

hello everybody we're the ministry team at evening like Tabernacle in Minden Louisiana we're happy that you have joined with us today and hope our discussion will bless you and enlighten you hope you'll get your friends to join with us and let everybody know that we're online and talking about the good word of God and we got some good things to talk about today once more we've been talking about the early church and how that Paul had said and John had said that the Antichrist would come and how he would come with the suction and so on but um he spoke of particularly actually it was John that spoke particularly in the early church leave losing its first love and I think of this is in the book of Revelation chapter 2 verse 2 that Jesus said I know thy works and thy labour and that patience and have that killeth bear with them that which are evil and now has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and have found them liars so we already see that there are imposters in the church and they are claiming the position of ministry of an apostle of apostle means once in right and and are not but they are not but they have found them ours and the early church was contending against these and and and discovering of these false apostles and it goes on but it goes on to say that even Jesus said of that church even though you you've done good you've wasted false apostles but yet I have somewhat against thee because thou has left that first love what do you think he was talking about there seems to be a pattern through the Bible see the book of Judges through revival history that when God visits a generation every time he visits a generation where he reveals a portion of his word or restores the word to a generation it brings revival in other words every revival is built off a revelation of the word brought to a certain something inspired in something and in yes and it returns their hearts back and then they set afire this causes what we would call revival we see it in judges where they would backslide want to be like the other nations and then God would send allow an enemy to come in and chase them and they begin to cry out to God and he would raise up a deliverer and then they would turn back to the Word of God and it would set a revival and then in the new testament church which was paul's age they they receive the Holy Ghost they received the New Testament and for a while they endured and they live victorious over sin they went out preaching the gospel and the power of the Resurrection but just just a brief span and that original fire begins to die down and it isn't anything obviously sinful for but it just begins to take on a formality aa formality the original fire the fervent desire to please God the reaching out in the spirit it all begins to fade and for his word his passion for his word the reaching out into the spirit it begins to fade and and then then the church begins to prospers it begins to grow and it leans towards material things opposed to its spiritual beginning begins to get formal worship you know becomes just a ritual something that we do you know I mean it's Sunday we're gonna go to church this you know it's just a ritual instead of that fervency that and it don't take very many generations for this to happen that's you you know this reminds me Isaiah's prophecy were he you know God said in Isaiah once and I hate you sacrifices I you know I don't want anymore they stitch in my nostril and because they were coming in worshipping actually doing what he said going through the motions of bringing the lamb offered the blood going through the sacrifice but they were doing it without sincerity you know it was now all this is what we do you know it was formerly it had no meaning they may see the person you know the the the lamb could now just be bought in the market and taken and and whatever you know originally they would have raised their lamb and loved that lamb and watched it to grow and and realize this lamb will die in my place for my sins but got a point you know it just now wasn't my religion it was my father's religion something handed down one of y'all mentioned want to go to church growing and and that's a good thing we want we want to see the church grow we want to see people have the opportunity and salvation but what happens is the the new people sitting on the Pew or the people born into a Christian family they're raised up in it but like you said it's there this daddy's religion so this is what I do this is where we've always gone to church so this is where I go and in the lack of fervency I believe is because they haven't had their own experience they're living off the glow of the light of another time you know they're hearing all the stories but they haven't experienced Christ for them cells come on so therefore they're just a church member yeah and when you're just a church member you don't have that love affair with Jesus as many as believed on Christ gave he power to become the sons of God are their grandsons not at all not at all there's only sons you can't be saved because your daddy's the preacher you can't be saved because your today we're the best Christians that ever lived that that in God's eyes doesn't matter that's what I'm you have to meet God you have to have an experience it has to be your sacrifice personal for you for your sins it seems to be a cycle throughout throughout all the ages that God would send an original fire right and then a couple generations after there seems to be an organization around that revival but it looks nothing like the original right yeah that's right and so they're associated with a name that is attached to that revival yeah and they bear record that they're associated with it right but they don't bear the life that came originally and and what's amazing is if we if we used an organization every organization is birth off a genuine revival that took place exactly but history tells us that no organization ever reproduces the original revival hmm in other words the Lutheran Church was a mighty revival that called the people out of the Dark Ages out of Catholicism and the bondage of superstition into the revelation that the just shall live by faith but the Lutheran's have never reproduced another revival like they had at the beginning isn't same with Wesley same through the ages so we see then a pattern and that's a cycle of revival and death that there's a revival only to die off in the next generation yes and and so you know but somewhere we got to break the cycle okay man yeah that's right amen I think every generation has to have a chance at the word every generation has its own revive its own revival a chance at the word that's been it's it's on us as ministers to present them a gospel that would give them a chance that that worked to help create an atmosphere the universe they can be be burped they come to that realization that it's not mama it's not my dad's the preacher of the pastor or a deacon but I know Christ genuinely for myself I have a personal revelation of what he's done for me and I believe that's the desire that we have here's a ministry team to create in this church and I believe we want to see that spread not only from this church but to others while we're doing these episodes is to share the good news and what the power God can do that you don't have to go up to down and have come out of revival only to die you can keep a constant because gotta keep you constant a mess so today a revival really is a protracted meeting we're gonna have a series of services which is our revival but really a church ought to be in constant revival should be on fire for God with the presence of God and the power of God working bringing salvation deliverance healings it ought to be an atmosphere and an expectancy I think people have lost their expectation because they lost their first love and what is that first love what was what was the first love of the first church I believe it was the Word of God the trend man a letter true the last true that's as you see that they lost the love for truth yeah they have no love for true that's right you see that later sin had a good start conforming to the world more than conforming to Christ and they start doing things that they used to wouldn't do it's not doing anything you still used to do that's a yes and before you know it those fires you don't if you don't had a log to fire at I see I mean you've got to keep you feed it you keep nurturing you keep moving on in the word you keep feeding on or you know and that's what happened you know all these false teachers begin to come in and like you said twist it a little bit and those fires begin to die and then they lost that love for the truth you know and then this is this part of what Paul said when he talked about that meant a sin and sitting in the church he said and for this cause God would send a strong delusion because they received not the love for the truth amen and so you know this is when you get the Holy Spirit in your life it gives you love and use your passion it gives you drive for truth yes and for the word of God and for it to have preeminence they asked Jesus what is the great commandment and and he said he said thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might this is the first and Great Commandment that is the very first and beginnings and in the first church they loved God with all that they sold their possessions they forsook their families they put everything into the gospel and the word had preeminence in the churches and in the lives of the people but shortly after that false apostles begin to move in and move people away from the word which plunges us into 2,000 years of a church ages and there's a lot that takes place in the book of Revelation and it was no surprise to the Lord the Lord spoke very specifically concerning the church and the 2,000 years of history that was going to follow Jesus told us that it would even go into the depths from the depths of God to the very depths of Satan my my and that that's all spelled out right in the book of Revelation in there you know very distinctly and it's a letter to the church which is astounding to me because so many avoid the book of Revelation altogether as though it can't be understood when that book is of vital importance to the church and to leaders of the church and and to this day it actually is the revelation of Jesus Christ exposing the devil for what he is know and telling Jesus said it when he the Holy Spirit of Truth has come he will lead you and guide you into all truth and show you things to come right so you know he's but that those words of losing their first love to the very first church age which was a reason age and that word means to be drifting or relaxed and that they had aimed at the high Collin but then realized God help us not to rely absolutely it was that relaxing that allowed the false teaching that allowed those things to get a foothold in there because if their love for the truth was just as fervent as it had ever been there have been quick to recognize exactly that had been quick to say we won't accept that but because there was a relaxing that's what allowed somebody subtle as a serpent to be able to speak something just a little twisted and then for them to accept it for them to take it down because they had relaxed a little bit their guard was analyzing words and so that that love for the word that first love there was no compromise than that none at all they were not compromise it would be like a husband and wife and their promises to each other in marriage as a hall had presented to Christ a chaste virgin yeah it was a it was a marriage covenant not that word they were married to that word right and they were not going to defile themselves they were not going to compromise that vow that word and so the first love in our life should be the Word of God it's nothing that we that we water down that we compromise that we just interpret or handle loosely but we live by it we defend it we fight for it we preach it you spoke about the book of Revelation you know that really I think the book of Revelation is really if you just kind of summed it all up it's about it's about two women right you know it's about a woman that's gonna be married to the lamb where that it says the marriage of the lamb has come there's somebody you don't because species has to marry species in right kind after kind in that so the lamb the Lamb of God will have a lamb on earth a bride of people who matches him who will be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh so that's one woman the other woman is this defiled woman yeah and she is called in the book of Revelation very harsh their homes you know something something that we don't like to speak about but the Bible's says leader it says it I mean so when we say what the Bible said he called her a and and that represents a woman who lost her first love and vows to her husband began to think the seed in the seeds of others that was not her husband and when the church you know drifts off with programs and seeds of man and theology and ideas that isn't that isn't firmly scriptural based that church becomes a hole in the body she manifests what Paul feared she that's right I fear yeah I want to present you as a chaste person you know but I fear yeah that's Satan he's gonna beguile you right I did he and and and you know this is true he he actually typed and placed the church as married to Christ and he's you know he said he typed her as a husband and wife relationship and he said about his church he gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious day man without spot or wrinkle or any such thing amen but that he should be holy and without blemish so this is God's object he will have a church that is virgin to his word that will be true to him that will give his word the preeminence and and that her headship is not a Pope or you know that district press matters are a denomination but her headship will be Christ the word word and that she'll give that word preeminence that it will have the oversight and the leadership instead of a man-made creeds and dogmas haebang babe when the Lord speaks of his bride he's not gonna say you have lost your first love a man no so he is the husband to this woman the the virgin bride Christ he is her head he is her owner he is her Lord so you know we come back to the the book of Revelation real briefly and he talks about the church and and there he said of this church that that the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for this is the righteousness of the same and so God will have a righteous church a man a righteous people that he will be married to United to will be one and he'll take that to a wedding that as we unite with him here but go there to that wedding supper in in the skies is promised to us and then after that a great millennial a man well that he'll will rule and reign with Christ a thousand years what a promise and how we want to be committed today and be that that glorious church without spot over here and that should be the ambition of all of our listeners out there today is let's be that glorious church let's not lose our passion and our drive and praise love for God but have that great desire a heart to do what is right with everything with this praising God bless you today thank you
