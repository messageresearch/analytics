[39:46] in the body of the dying of the lord
[39:48] jesus
[39:49] that the life also of jesus might be
[39:52] made manifest
[39:53] in our body for we which live
[39:57] are always delivered unto death for
[39:59] jesus's sake
[40:00] that the life also of jesus might be
[40:03] made manifest
[40:04] in our mortal flesh so then death
[40:07] worketh in us
[40:08] but life in you we have in the same
[40:10] spirit of faith
[40:12] according as it is written i believe and
[40:15] therefore i have spoken
[40:17] we also believe and therefore speak
[40:20] knowing that he which raised up the lord
[40:22] jesus shall
[40:23] raise up us also by jesus and shall
[40:27] present us with him
[40:28] for all things are not for all things
[40:32] or for your sakes that the abundant
[40:33] grace might through the thanksgiving
[40:36] of many redound to the glory of god for
[40:38] which cause we faint not
[40:40] but though our outward man perish yet
[40:42] the inward man is renewed day by day
[40:44] for our light affliction which is but
[40:47] for a moment worketh for us
[40:48] a far more exceeding and eternal way to
[40:51] glory
[40:52] while we look not at the things which
[40:54] are seen
[40:55] but at the things which are not seen for
[40:58] the things which are seen are temporal
[41:00] but the things which are not seen are
[41:02] eternal you can be seated tonight
[41:05] as i said we're going to speak to you
[41:09] when it's not the end of the story
[41:14] you know and just kind of looking back
[41:16] and not that i'm an idiot by any step of
[41:18] the imagination but
[41:20] i just kind of looked up the word story
[41:22] because i want to make sure i
[41:23] knew what story meant because we can get
[41:26] several opinions of what a story is
[41:28] if i was asked you tonight what's the
[41:29] definition but the definition of story
[41:32] is
[41:32] an account of incidents or events
[41:36] an account excuse me of incidents or
[41:39] events
[41:39] and we know there's true love stories
[41:42] there's fiction stories there's
[41:44] non-fiction stories there's
[41:46] animated stories there's all kind of
[41:48] stories
[41:49] uh that we know about but tonight i want
[41:51] to bring it down personal to you
[41:54] because we know that there's times in
[41:55] our lives
[41:57] that maybe our story didn't have such a
[42:00] great
[42:01] a great chapter in it maybe there was
[42:04] times it wasn't so glamorous maybe there
[42:06] was times in your life
[42:07] where you wish you could forget that
[42:09] portion
[42:10] if you could just erase that chapter
[42:12] erase that portion of that story
[42:14] and never think about it again there was
[42:16] days when you didn't walk with the lord
[42:20] and yet you are today because of that
[42:22] walk
[42:23] or that lack of that walk now you're
[42:25] reaping
[42:26] the repercussions of that and you wish
[42:29] that maybe you didn't or
[42:30] you wish that you could do it all over
[42:32] again and there's sad
[42:34] times in our store maybe you lost a
[42:36] loved one and now you're left
[42:38] trying to figure out how to navigate
[42:39] life alone because
[42:41] the spouse that you've been married to
[42:42] for many years is no longer there
[42:44] and yet your story is filled with
[42:46] emotions and
[42:47] maybe it's filled with anxieties maybe
[42:49] it's filled with a lot of stress
[42:52] and then there's exciting times then
[42:55] there's some doors that are open
[42:57] and things that are happening for you
[42:59] and you're flourishing and prospering
[43:00] and you got
[43:01] wonderful memories and you're cherishing
[43:03] all those and
[43:04] all these events make up your story
[43:10] but i don't want you to focus on all the
[43:12] events that are making up your story
[43:14] tonight
[43:14] i want to focus on how does your story
[43:17] end
[43:19] we all have a story here tonight and
[43:22] some of you
[43:22] you've made the right choices others
[43:24] you're on the path to
[43:26] make the right choices others you've not
[43:28] made that choice yet
[43:29] but i'm asking you to focus tonight on
[43:32] how
[43:32] does your story end
[43:36] and we look here in romans 8 and the
[43:38] bible would tell us in verse 5
[43:40] for they that are after the flesh do
[43:42] mind the things of the flesh
[43:44] but they that are after the spirit the
[43:47] things of the spirit
[43:48] for to be carnally minded is death but
[43:50] to be spiritually minded
[43:52] is life and peace because the carnal
[43:55] mind is
[43:56] enmity with god or against god for it is
[43:59] not
[43:59] subject to the law of god neither indeed
[44:01] can it be
[44:03] so then they that are of the flesh
[44:05] cannot please
[44:06] god so when you get into the flesh
[44:10] you're not pleasing god
[44:12] and that's why we find this here in
[44:14] romans 12 when we skip over to romans 12
[44:16] and verse 1.
[44:17] the bible would tell us i beseech you
[44:20] excuse me therefore brother
[44:24] by the mercies of god that you present
[44:27] your bodies
[44:28] as a living sacrifice holy acceptable
[44:32] unto god
[44:33] which is your reasonable service and
[44:35] notice
[44:36] verse 2 and be not conformed to this
[44:39] world
[44:40] but be you transformed by the renewing
[44:43] of your mind
[44:45] now the bible will tell us in chapter 8
[44:47] that to be
[44:48] carnally minded is death that's why paul
[44:51] would tell us in chapter 12
[44:52] you've got to have your mind renewed
[44:54] today and if there was ever a time in a
[44:57] generation and a people
[44:59] to be having their minds renewed is now
[45:02] there's so much pulling against you
[45:04] there's so much coming at you
[45:06] that now is the time young people that
[45:09] you got to have your minds renewed
[45:12] renewed by the word of god renewed by
[45:14] the holy ghost
[45:15] renewed by the baptism of fire in this
[45:18] hour
[45:20] so we finally to be carnally minded as
[45:22] enmity against god
[45:24] therefore we must have our minds renewed
[45:28] the best christian here tonight and
[45:30] don't raise your hand
[45:32] thinking you're that one but the best
[45:34] christian here tonight the most pies
[45:36] when you feel like your life just toes
[45:38] the line
[45:39] the bible would tell us that you were
[45:42] shaping
[45:43] iniquity and in
[45:46] sin did your mother conceive you
[45:50] so you were born in sin you were shaped
[45:53] in iniquity you came to this world
[45:55] needing your mind your thoughts your
[45:57] life renewed by the word of god
[46:03] we find here in genesis 2
[46:06] verse 16 and the lord god commanded
[46:10] the man saying of every tree of the
[46:12] garden thou mayest freely eat
[46:16] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[46:18] evil thou shall not eat
[46:21] of it for in the day that you eat
[46:23] thereof
[46:24] thou shall surely die so notice man can
[46:28] eat
[46:28] of all the trees of the garden but the
[46:30] one in the midst of the garden
[46:31] don't touch it don't look at it don't
[46:33] partake of it or you're gonna die
[46:35] then we find in genesis three and verse
[46:37] one now the serpent
[46:38] he was more subtle than any beast of the
[46:41] field
[46:42] which the lord god had made and he said
[46:44] unto the woman notice now he begins to
[46:46] talk to the woman not the man
[46:48] he says yeah god said you shall not eat
[46:50] of every tree of the garden and the
[46:51] woman said unto the serpent
[46:53] we may eat of the fruit of the tree of
[46:56] the gardens
[46:57] or the trees of the garden but of the
[46:59] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[47:00] of the garden god has said
[47:02] you shall not eat it neither shall you
[47:04] touch it lest you die
[47:06] so she was saying what adam had said
[47:10] she was speaking of her her earthly
[47:14] husband
[47:15] his commandment his word he knew that he
[47:17] spoke expressly with god and god told
[47:20] him
[47:20] if you eat thereof you're gonna die so
[47:22] she's having this conversation
[47:24] with the enemy or with the serpent
[47:27] and if she would have left off right
[47:29] here and no longer entertainment walked
[47:31] away from the conversation
[47:32] and went back to her husband and began
[47:35] to confess oh i had a conversation with
[47:37] him this is what he said and let her
[47:38] husband deal with it
[47:40] it'd have been a different story but we
[47:41] find she continued to entertain
[47:44] and she could continue to welcome the
[47:46] conversation
[47:48] because the devil always makes it
[47:50] appealing
[47:52] to the natural he always makes it
[47:55] appealing
[47:56] to the senses of the flesh and we find
[47:58] here the serpent began to speak back to
[48:00] her
[48:01] you shall not surely die how many you've
[48:04] ever been tempted
[48:06] and you stood on the word of god but
[48:07] then the enemy come right back said
[48:09] damn that's not gonna happen not for you
[48:12] look at you you're a good christian you
[48:14] got the holy ghost only to fall
[48:17] only to be tempted some of you young
[48:19] boys claiming you got the holy ghost and
[48:21] yet
[48:22] you you find yourself slipping up and
[48:24] looking at things you shouldn't look at
[48:27] and we find you want that but you're
[48:29] constantly entertaining the lie
[48:31] of the enemy he's putting this beautiful
[48:34] model in front of you
[48:35] but that's not beauty that's death
[48:37] because if you
[48:38] partake of that tree no there's nothing
[48:41] left but a death sentence atonia
[48:44] so the enemy would say for god knoweth
[48:47] that in the day
[48:48] you eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[48:49] open and you shall be as gods knowing
[48:51] good and evil
[48:53] notice he began to reason with her
[48:57] and he reasons with all of us his
[48:58] tactics have not changed
[49:01] why we have to have our minds renewed by
[49:03] the word of god
[49:05] our thinking must be this word this word
[49:07] this word this word this word
[49:09] anytime satan presents you a a
[49:12] proposition
[49:13] you take them back to this word because
[49:16] heavens and earth will pass away
[49:18] excuse me but this word will never pass
[49:21] away so we find
[49:25] here and when the woman saw that the
[49:27] tree was good for food and that
[49:30] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[49:33] to be desired to make one wise
[49:36] that she took of the fruit thereof and
[49:37] did eat and gave also to her husband
[49:40] with her and he did eat so we find the
[49:43] best christian here tonight
[49:45] your origin starts right here
[49:50] that birth where you were shaped in
[49:52] iniquity and
[49:53] came to the world conceived in sin
[49:56] starts right here there's not one of us
[50:00] here tonight that bypass this birth
[50:05] and we look at this scene here and it's
[50:07] an awful scene and
[50:08] you know god's original plan was for man
[50:10] to come by the spoken word
[50:12] but eve listened and she entertained the
[50:14] live the devil
[50:15] and she gave it she regarded it above
[50:18] her husband's own word
[50:19] and because she partook of the devil's
[50:21] lie and she laid with the enemy
[50:24] and she gave all to us also to adam and
[50:26] he partook of it
[50:28] what did he do it thrusts the human race
[50:30] into sin
[50:31] it thrusts the human race into slavery
[50:34] it thrusts the human race into
[50:36] bondage and now every one of us
[50:39] tonight we bypass our theophanies and we
[50:42] come into this world
[50:44] a sinner
[50:48] we come shaped in iniquity we come in
[50:50] sin
[50:52] otherwise we were born with the death
[50:54] sentence
[50:57] we were born with a destiny and the only
[50:59] way to escape the death sinus
[51:02] is to partake of the tree of life
[51:05] the only way to escape the sin's penalty
[51:08] is to partake of the tree of life
[51:12] and the prophet of god will tell us here
[51:14] in ephesian church age
[51:15] he says now the tree of life is a person
[51:19] he says trees throughout the scriptures
[51:22] refer to persons as in psalms 1.
[51:25] thus the tree of life must be the person
[51:27] of life and that is jesus
[51:29] so now in the garden of eden there were
[51:31] two trees the tree of life
[51:33] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[51:34] evil
[51:36] so we find one of those trees was a tree
[51:38] of life the other was a tree of
[51:39] knowledge of good and evil
[51:41] man was to live by the tree of life but
[51:43] he was not to touch
[51:44] the tree or the other tree or he would
[51:47] die but
[51:47] man did partake of that tree and when he
[51:50] did
[51:51] death entered the human race by sin and
[51:53] he became
[51:54] separated from god
[51:58] so if the tree of life is a person then
[52:00] the tree of knowledge and good and evil
[52:02] is also a person
[52:06] and we find that the bible will tell us
[52:09] in ezekiel 28
[52:10] verse 13 that thou satan has been in the
[52:14] eaten
[52:14] the garden of god satan was there
[52:20] so our origin starts here and we find
[52:22] that the beast we know this
[52:24] very well he was close to a human he was
[52:26] an upright creature
[52:27] but he had he was pure animal he could
[52:29] reason he can talk
[52:31] he was between the chimpanzee and the
[52:32] man but closer to the man
[52:34] that his seed could mingle with the
[52:36] woman's seed and bring forth life
[52:38] and we find that the prophet god said
[52:40] that happened here in genesis 3
[52:42] eve turned away from life and she
[52:45] accepted
[52:46] death said brother joe you're
[52:49] painting an awful picture you're exactly
[52:52] right
[52:52] sin is an awful picture there's no need
[52:56] to glamorize sin there's no need to say
[52:58] oh i've got it everything and yet you're
[53:00] a sinner and you're away from god
[53:02] sin separates you from god sin separates
[53:06] you from your sonship
[53:07] sin destroys families sin destroys life
[53:10] and i'm going to tell you there's
[53:11] nothing glorious about sin
[53:14] but i want you to know tonight church
[53:16] it's not the end of the story
[53:19] god has provided better things for them
[53:23] oh hallelujah notice now adam
[53:26] our first father he sowed the human race
[53:29] into sin into slavery
[53:32] so eve notice now eve
[53:36] she partook of it and they asked brother
[53:38] branham an ephesian church ager he
[53:40] claims it here he says now if he felt
[53:42] that way what did adam do
[53:44] for god laid the blame on adam
[53:47] and this is what adam did adam took her
[53:51] back adam took her back
[53:55] adam took her back she was part of him
[53:58] and he was willing to take the
[54:00] responsibility
[54:01] upon himself he would not let her go so
[54:04] eve conceived by him
[54:05] he knew she would he knew exactly what
[54:08] would happen to the human race
[54:10] and he sold the human race into sin
[54:14] that he might have eve for he loved her
[54:18] amen
[54:21] adam our first father sowed us into
[54:23] slavery
[54:24] nothing we had to do with it
[54:28] and we find today that satan and his
[54:31] minions and his devils and all these
[54:33] they come to you
[54:34] every day how many of you do satan come
[54:36] and knock on your door
[54:38] well some of y'all are really good
[54:39] christians aren't you you don't raise
[54:40] your hand
[54:41] you're scared to be called out but no we
[54:44] all we face the enemy comes every day
[54:46] tempting us and trying us and he's there
[54:48] to remind you that you are born a sinner
[54:52] notice i said to remind you that you
[54:53] were born a sinner not that you are
[54:56] a sinner but that you were born this way
[54:58] and if he can
[54:59] ever keep you beat down if he can ever
[55:01] keep you living below your god-given
[55:04] privilege
[55:04] then satan has control of your life
[55:08] but i want you to know tonight that's
[55:10] not the end of the story
[55:12] god has provided a substitute god had
[55:14] came himself
[55:15] god come down he condescended so that we
[55:19] cannot sin
[55:23] notice now you can't help being born the
[55:26] way you were born
[55:27] how many you would change your first
[55:29] birth everybody come on rachel that's
[55:31] when you raise your hand
[55:33] we don't we we didn't we we would rather
[55:36] not
[55:36] be born with sinful desires i don't know
[55:39] about you but i don't i mean i had
[55:41] enough of it
[55:42] and we deal with it on a daily basis we
[55:44] all are born and sins shaped in iniquity
[55:46] but you can't help your first birth you
[55:48] absolutely have no choice in the matter
[55:51] that era belongs to adam and since that
[55:54] time there's been a great battle raging
[55:57] in the human mind because the human mind
[56:00] was the place it was the battleground it
[56:03] was selected
[56:04] because decisions have to be made
[56:06] decisions are made in the human mind
[56:09] adam made the decision to take his wife
[56:12] adam consciously made the decision to to
[56:15] leave eternity
[56:16] and to push the human race into sin in
[56:19] an element of time
[56:20] so that he could take his wife back
[56:22] because she was born of his bone
[56:24] and flesh of his flesh what was adam
[56:26] doing he was showing what god was going
[56:28] to do
[56:28] through a lamb of god one day to take
[56:31] back sinful man
[56:32] and redeem him back because she was born
[56:34] of his bow
[56:35] and flesh of his flesh he wasn't willing
[56:38] to let her go
[56:39] oh hallelujah church i don't care the
[56:41] dirtiest one of me tonight
[56:43] he's not willing to let you go but he
[56:46] loves you
[56:48] and he's willing and he's able to take
[56:51] that responsibility
[56:53] and bury it on his shoulders
[56:58] decisions are made in the mind and
[57:01] that's where satan meets you
[57:04] and the decisions are he says because
[57:07] god made man that way
[57:09] so adam consciously made a choice
[57:13] made a decision and his decision is what
[57:17] sold man
[57:18] into sin and tonight
[57:22] we each have to make a decision what are
[57:24] you going to get out of this service
[57:27] you have to decide young man you have to
[57:30] decide tonight
[57:31] do you fully surrender and let your life
[57:36] be rewritten
[57:38] or do you continue on
[57:41] young lady do you surrender fully
[57:43] tonight and allow god to rewrite the
[57:46] narrative of your story
[57:48] or do you continue on in sin
[57:52] so we find there are decisions that's
[57:54] got to be made
[57:56] and tonight you can make your final
[57:59] decision
[58:01] you can make your final decision i want
[58:03] to go here to luke 15
[58:06] and verse 11.
[58:09] luke 15 and verse 11. notice
[58:12] the battleground the mind decisions
[58:16] have to be made it said that there was a
[58:19] man he had two sons
[58:21] and the younger of them said to his
[58:23] father father give me
[58:25] the portion of goods that followed to me
[58:28] and he divided unto them his living
[58:32] now if you look at this right here the
[58:33] son was saying
[58:35] father i would that you would die so
[58:38] that i could have my inheritance now
[58:42] and we go on to the story it says and
[58:45] not many days after the younger son
[58:47] gathered all together he took his
[58:49] journey
[58:50] into a far country he didn't just pack
[58:54] up and go to dixie inn
[58:56] he didn't just pack up and go to mendon
[58:57] or go to the house next door he went
[58:59] into a far
[59:01] country what are you saying brother i'm
[59:03] telling you sin will take you
[59:05] farther than you want to go sin will
[59:08] take you farther than you expect to go
[59:10] and sin will slowly but surely
[59:14] completely take control of every facet
[59:17] of your life
[59:18] sin will make the decisions that you
[59:20] make be
[59:21] dictated by its origin sin will control
[59:24] every decision you make
[59:26] if you let it there and the scripture
[59:28] will tell us that we keep going on here
[59:30] he says now
[59:31] and when he had spent all that he had
[59:33] there rose a great
[59:34] famine isn't that ironic now he's a bomb
[59:38] he got nothing no more money but yet
[59:40] there's a famine arises in the land
[59:42] and he began to be in want and he went
[59:44] and he joined himself
[59:45] to a citizen of that country and he sent
[59:47] him into the fields to feed swine
[59:50] this young man made a conscious decision
[59:54] to go to his father and say father i
[59:57] want my
[59:59] and what belongs to me as if you were
[1:00:02] dead right now
[1:00:03] i want my portion so we can just let's
[1:00:06] just kind of bring this to modern day
[1:00:08] can we do that for
[1:00:09] just a little bit you know i can just
[1:00:12] imagine this young man someone like you
[1:00:13] young boys how many you're in a public
[1:00:15] school system
[1:00:17] man we got no public school we got one
[1:00:20] we got can we i would just say we got a
[1:00:21] couple how about that
[1:00:23] some of y'all are scared to even admit
[1:00:24] that
[1:00:26] say he's in a public school system and
[1:00:28] he's started hanging around the wrong
[1:00:30] boys and
[1:00:31] the wrong crowd and maybe his friends
[1:00:33] talked him into you know hey won't you
[1:00:35] come hit this fake pipe
[1:00:37] started vaping or hitting a cigarette
[1:00:39] you know vaping it don't smell
[1:00:40] you don't get to smell all of your
[1:00:41] clothes or the you know so we don't do
[1:00:44] cigarettes we do the vaping and
[1:00:45] maybe they talked you into taking that
[1:00:46] first sip of alcohol
[1:00:50] or maybe some low-grade drug take a hit
[1:00:52] off a marijuana joint
[1:00:53] or maybe look at this nudist magazine or
[1:00:56] something of that nature some porn
[1:00:59] and it just you make a decision
[1:01:03] notice you make a decision to look at
[1:01:06] this and he began
[1:01:07] to esteem what his friends thought over
[1:01:09] that of his father
[1:01:11] oh you could do this you do this you'd
[1:01:13] be cool man you'd be the coolest man
[1:01:16] in the church you'd be the coolest young
[1:01:18] boy at school
[1:01:19] i mean everybody knows your dad is
[1:01:21] loaded
[1:01:22] he's a rich man won't you just go to him
[1:01:24] and ask him for all the money that he
[1:01:26] owes you
[1:01:27] or that's due to you go ahead and get
[1:01:28] your inheritance and you think about
[1:01:30] just a little bit of alcohol
[1:01:31] we can have an alcohol party every night
[1:01:34] for a long time we can just live it up
[1:01:36] so he makes the conscious decision to go
[1:01:40] request this from his father
[1:01:43] but i want you to know young person no
[1:01:45] alcoholic ever takes that first sip
[1:01:46] desire to be an alcoholic
[1:01:50] no druggie ever takes that first hit
[1:01:53] with the idea that i want to be a junkie
[1:01:56] and i want my life controlled by drugs
[1:01:58] and alcohol
[1:02:01] but we find satan took reasoning and he
[1:02:04] takes reasoning
[1:02:05] and he attacked the word of god and he
[1:02:06] shook eve off the path
[1:02:08] that's right by reasoning human
[1:02:10] reasoning he says now
[1:02:12] the only way that he or she could have
[1:02:14] to god to disbelieve god's word
[1:02:16] it had to be appealing
[1:02:19] and satan knows how to make reasoning
[1:02:21] appealing he
[1:02:23] has to appeal to you and sin is
[1:02:26] very appealing
[1:02:30] satan makes sin so appealing to you
[1:02:34] so this young man didn't think that he's
[1:02:36] going to ask for this money because he
[1:02:38] was going to have an awful time
[1:02:39] in the world no he thought that man the
[1:02:42] lord or the devil
[1:02:43] then painted him a beautiful picture so
[1:02:46] he thought
[1:02:46] of what life was going to be like when
[1:02:49] he's out from underneath
[1:02:50] the shadows of his father when he's out
[1:02:52] from underneath the bondage of
[1:02:54] you've got to go to church and you've
[1:02:55] got to do this and you've got to do that
[1:02:57] oh you're going to live it up i mean he
[1:02:59] had painted him a glorious picture look
[1:03:01] you can have women you can have drugs
[1:03:03] you can have alcohol
[1:03:05] you can do whatever you want you're free
[1:03:07] in the world
[1:03:14] so he could think about was being out
[1:03:16] from under bondage
[1:03:19] all he could think about was i'm coming
[1:03:21] of age
[1:03:22] i want to be my own man
[1:03:28] he didn't ask for his portion thinking
[1:03:31] that he was going to end up in a pig
[1:03:32] pile
[1:03:34] he didn't ask for his portion because he
[1:03:36] wanted that to be his end
[1:03:38] he asked because sin was appealing
[1:03:43] because he thought he was going to live
[1:03:44] it up that first hit
[1:03:47] that first drag off a cigarette or a
[1:03:48] vape that first
[1:03:51] sip of a bottle
[1:03:55] brother adam tells this story and i
[1:03:56] don't mind saying it right here but
[1:03:58] this is in the conflict between god and
[1:04:00] satan
[1:04:01] he says i often thought as a young man i
[1:04:03] read about different nations and morals
[1:04:05] of the country and i heard different
[1:04:07] people tell about
[1:04:08] especially down in france down there in
[1:04:10] a place they called pig alley
[1:04:13] he said how that the people were so
[1:04:14] immoral this was a
[1:04:16] this was a very uh risque street there
[1:04:19] in france
[1:04:21] he says ah he goes out he goes i'll see
[1:04:23] them people down there women coming out
[1:04:25] you know reprobates and
[1:04:27] such old haggy look you know and and
[1:04:29] mean and
[1:04:30] he goes i went down the pig alley the
[1:04:32] first night me and three other ministers
[1:04:34] he goes brother
[1:04:35] what a surprise we got
[1:04:38] now satan is too smart for that he isn't
[1:04:41] going to produce something like that
[1:04:43] but some of the prettiest girls i've
[1:04:45] ever seen in my life was there
[1:04:47] appealing certainly since sin is
[1:04:50] appealing and attractive
[1:04:51] satan hasn't got forked horns and some
[1:04:54] pony a pointed tail
[1:04:55] he's not some john polycorn out there
[1:04:57] with a coat hanging on in his ears
[1:04:59] hanging down
[1:05:00] he's a slicker and sin is appealing
[1:05:03] sin isn't just rude like you think it is
[1:05:06] it's very
[1:05:07] appealing
[1:05:10] so he makes it appealing glitter
[1:05:15] and he finds he keeps changing the bait
[1:05:19] he used to you'd have to go to a store
[1:05:21] and get a magazine
[1:05:23] then the internet popped up and you
[1:05:25] could get it on your computer
[1:05:28] now if you've got a smartphone it's
[1:05:29] easily accessible
[1:05:31] any degraded debauchery sin you want to
[1:05:35] look at
[1:05:37] so this bible says that this young man
[1:05:40] wasted his substance
[1:05:42] luke 15 and verse 30 but as soon as thy
[1:05:46] son was come which hath devoured thy
[1:05:48] living with heartless
[1:05:50] notice he wasted everything that he had
[1:05:54] on harlots on riotous living
[1:05:59] it exhausted his body it debased his
[1:06:02] mind it ruined his soul it destroyed
[1:06:05] every aspect of his humanity
[1:06:08] because he was giving himself over to
[1:06:11] sin what a ugly story i'm telling you
[1:06:14] but i'm here to tell you tonight that's
[1:06:16] not the end
[1:06:17] of the story church
[1:06:21] we find this young man he's out of money
[1:06:23] we find him that he's now he doesn't
[1:06:25] have a job
[1:06:26] we look back and we see the lights got
[1:06:29] shut off he has no money to pay the bill
[1:06:32] he's been evicted from his apartment
[1:06:34] he's sleeping in a car
[1:06:35] or under a a bridge somewhere
[1:06:39] and no matter how bad his life has
[1:06:41] gotten he
[1:06:42] yet made the decision to turn home
[1:06:47] instead of turning home he goes and
[1:06:50] joins himself with a citizen
[1:06:52] in the land and begins to feed swine
[1:06:57] and if you know anything about the
[1:06:59] jewish culture pigs are detested
[1:07:01] they're unclean not only did he go and
[1:07:04] feed swine but he began to
[1:07:06] long for the food in which he was
[1:07:08] feeding them
[1:07:09] we could say this young man hit rock
[1:07:12] bottom
[1:07:14] there was nowhere else for him to turn
[1:07:16] but home and he refused to turn home
[1:07:19] see he had to make a decision instead of
[1:07:21] turning home he went farther
[1:07:23] and farther into sin and it took him
[1:07:26] further
[1:07:26] and farther into a refereeing life until
[1:07:29] he wound up
[1:07:30] in a pig slop feeding pigs
[1:07:35] and no doubt all the reports that the
[1:07:38] father received was
[1:07:39] your son just did this your son's doing
[1:07:41] this your son's doing this
[1:07:43] and doing this and doing this and your
[1:07:45] heart breaks
[1:07:47] and breaks and breaks
[1:07:50] and breaks because instead of turning to
[1:07:54] the lord
[1:07:55] instead of turning to the father
[1:07:58] he turns further to the world
[1:08:02] but that's not the end of the story
[1:08:07] you hear tonight that's got a loved one
[1:08:10] some of you that got sons and daughters
[1:08:12] out there that are wayward and running
[1:08:14] husbands and spouses i want you to know
[1:08:15] tonight
[1:08:16] it's not the end of the story
[1:08:20] oh i'm telling you if i was you tonight
[1:08:22] i'd be clinging to this
[1:08:24] it's not the end of the story brother
[1:08:26] joe i just got a report
[1:08:28] he did this and she did that and they're
[1:08:30] in drugs it doesn't matter this young
[1:08:32] man
[1:08:32] had went all the way from oh he was a
[1:08:35] wealthy son
[1:08:36] a son of a fluffy father and now he's
[1:08:38] living in a pink stop
[1:08:39] he got no money he's got no rest he's
[1:08:42] got no home
[1:08:43] he's got nothing but i'm here to tell
[1:08:45] you tonight it wasn't the end
[1:08:47] of his story god was just about to stop
[1:08:50] and shake him let me tell you a church
[1:08:52] god is here tonight
[1:08:54] to shake our young people let's shake
[1:08:56] our prodigals
[1:08:57] to shape those that are wavering and
[1:08:59] running from the lord he's here
[1:09:01] to do the shaking
[1:09:04] it's not the end don't you think it's
[1:09:06] the end
[1:09:10] god allowed the sinner to come
[1:09:15] you want that in a in a quote why did he
[1:09:19] ever
[1:09:20] let the sinner come why did god ever let
[1:09:23] our center come
[1:09:24] he had to let a sinner come
[1:09:28] for the purpose of him being a savior
[1:09:31] god had an attribute he's going to not
[1:09:34] only be a father
[1:09:35] but he's going to be a savior so notice
[1:09:40] so god could be a savior he let the man
[1:09:42] get sick
[1:09:43] because he's a healer he's just
[1:09:46] he has to be just and he has to put the
[1:09:49] tree of life
[1:09:51] and the tree of death before every man
[1:09:54] like he did adam and eve
[1:09:55] or he did wrong in the first place so
[1:09:58] before you tonight
[1:09:59] is a tree of life and before you tonight
[1:10:02] is a tree of death
[1:10:04] knowledge of good and evil you can
[1:10:06] choose to smoke your vape
[1:10:08] smoke your cigarettes look at your
[1:10:09] pornography take a hit off the bottle
[1:10:11] drugs whatever you want
[1:10:14] or you can choose the tree of life the
[1:10:17] only way back
[1:10:18] from the death sentence is to partake of
[1:10:21] the tree of life
[1:10:23] the tree of knowledge is going to take
[1:10:25] you further and further
[1:10:27] and further and further we find here now
[1:10:31] luke 15
[1:10:32] verse 17 and when he
[1:10:35] came to himself what parent is longing
[1:10:39] for that day
[1:10:41] sister brother johnny
[1:10:46] longin for when they come shell malika
[1:10:49] jairus come to themselves
[1:10:54] oh we got prodigal church but we got a
[1:10:57] promise
[1:10:58] that's bigger than our prodigals
[1:11:02] did you hear what i said we got
[1:11:04] prodigals it's evident
[1:11:07] nathan's been running but we got a
[1:11:09] promise
[1:11:10] no matter how far he can run we've got a
[1:11:13] promise that he'll leave the 90-9
[1:11:15] and he'll save that lost wayfaring lamb
[1:11:18] he'll go after that one
[1:11:20] if he'll cross the razing sea for some
[1:11:23] maniac on the other side
[1:11:24] had reached up in a moment and said dog
[1:11:27] god saved me
[1:11:28] and yet he was cutting himself and
[1:11:30] living in the tooth god didn't let that
[1:11:32] be the end of his story
[1:11:33] no he said the word there and the word
[1:11:36] released him
[1:11:37] from the bodies that he was in and i'm
[1:11:38] going to tell you tonight that same word
[1:11:40] will be released upon you and your young
[1:11:43] people
[1:11:44] and your son and your daughters if you
[1:11:47] can believe it
[1:11:49] that's a promise we need to hold on to
[1:11:51] notice now he came to himself
[1:11:54] and he said how many hired servants of
[1:11:57] my father's house have bread
[1:12:00] enough to spare and i perish
[1:12:03] with hunger now this word or this phrase
[1:12:08] here he came to himself
[1:12:10] means that he was deranged he was insane
[1:12:14] and any man that's away from god is
[1:12:17] insane
[1:12:18] you may think you're intelligent you're
[1:12:20] just an intelligent insanity
[1:12:22] you may think you're super smart you're
[1:12:24] super smart and stupid at the same time
[1:12:27] because you're deranged you're insane
[1:12:30] but notice now
[1:12:33] john 6 and verse 44 would say no man can
[1:12:36] come
[1:12:37] to me except the father which has sent
[1:12:40] me draw him
[1:12:43] and i will raise him up at the last day
[1:12:46] so no man can come to me except the
[1:12:49] father
[1:12:50] go and shake them and brother tim
[1:12:54] brought this out
[1:12:54] not knowing that i already had it in my
[1:12:56] notes the angel of the lord
[1:12:59] visited that fowl infested pig slop
[1:13:05] he went to that house where that
[1:13:08] daughter or that son
[1:13:09] was living with somebody else outside of
[1:13:12] marriage
[1:13:13] he went into that bar room let me just
[1:13:16] tell you personally like he did for me
[1:13:18] he came in my car on a night that i
[1:13:21] didn't want to live
[1:13:23] when a night that i thought it was the
[1:13:25] end of my story
[1:13:27] all but the angel of the lord and it's
[1:13:29] one of the only times he ever
[1:13:31] i've ever heard an audible voice in all
[1:13:33] of my life and it said turn
[1:13:35] your car around now i didn't have a
[1:13:38] christian upbringing i didn't understand
[1:13:40] what was going on
[1:13:41] all i knew is i heard the voice and i
[1:13:43] turned around
[1:13:44] so the angel of the lord visited me in
[1:13:46] my moment of despair
[1:13:48] he visited me when i was drunk and i
[1:13:50] wanted to take my life but he didn't
[1:13:52] leave me where he found me oh hallelujah
[1:13:54] he came my way and turned my life around
[1:13:58] and he came to this big infested pig
[1:14:00] sloth and he shook that boy
[1:14:02] you've been running long enough you've
[1:14:04] been waving long enough
[1:14:06] you've been away from home long enough
[1:14:08] you've been away from the father
[1:14:10] long enough arrive and go to the
[1:14:13] father's house
[1:14:15] arise and go to the father's house
[1:14:24] it's time that you arise and he says
[1:14:29] i will arise
[1:14:32] verse 18 i will arise and i'll go to my
[1:14:36] father
[1:14:37] and i'll say to him father i've sinned
[1:14:39] against heaven
[1:14:41] and before thee i am no more worried
[1:14:44] to be called thy son make me as one of
[1:14:46] our heart servants
[1:14:50] and he arose and he came to his father
[1:14:54] but when he was yet a great way off
[1:14:58] his father saw him because his father
[1:15:02] was holding on to a promise
[1:15:05] oh his father was holding on to a
[1:15:07] promise
[1:15:08] i gave you to god at the altar
[1:15:13] i'm gonna hold on to that promise that
[1:15:15] day and their offspring
[1:15:17] will be there i'm gonna hold on to it
[1:15:20] that is for you for your children
[1:15:24] even for your children's children to
[1:15:26] them that are
[1:15:27] far off in a far country
[1:15:31] it's for them too notice now
[1:15:35] when he was a great distance off his
[1:15:37] father saw him when he had compassion
[1:15:39] and he ran and he fell on his neck
[1:15:41] and he kissed him verse 22. but the
[1:15:43] father said to his servants
[1:15:46] bring forth the best robe and put it on
[1:15:48] them and put a ring on his hand and
[1:15:49] shoes on his feet
[1:15:50] and bring him to the fatted calf and
[1:15:52] kill it and let us eat and be married
[1:15:54] for
[1:15:54] this my son was dead and is alive again
[1:15:58] he was lost
[1:15:59] and is found and they begin to be
[1:16:01] married
[1:16:03] so we find here that this father began
[1:16:05] to run to his son
[1:16:07] now in this custom in the ancient near
[1:16:09] east this culture this
[1:16:11] this right here was frowned upon it was
[1:16:14] considered taboo
[1:16:15] because the father had to pull up his
[1:16:17] tunic up to his hips
[1:16:18] expose his legs and this was
[1:16:21] embarrassing it brought shame to the
[1:16:22] family
[1:16:23] but yet the father didn't care because
[1:16:25] it was his son
[1:16:26] that he was running to let me tell you
[1:16:28] our father doesn't care what he has to
[1:16:30] do
[1:16:31] he doesn't mind pulling up the tunic and
[1:16:33] running to you
[1:16:34] whatever it takes he's ready whatever it
[1:16:37] takes
[1:16:37] if that son begins to come home he's
[1:16:39] there to run to him
[1:16:40] he's there to embrace him he's there to
[1:16:43] show them love and support
[1:16:44] and i welcome him back to the family
[1:16:48] notice he didn't go and scold his son
[1:16:51] how dare you
[1:16:53] no he didn't scold him
[1:16:57] but he gave him a lavish welcome party
[1:17:02] notice what he said go get a robe we're
[1:17:04] going to change these old pitch slot
[1:17:06] robes
[1:17:06] or tattered clothes smelling like pig
[1:17:09] manure
[1:17:12] we're going to change your robe to
[1:17:14] change his dignity
[1:17:16] and god traded your old sinful robes
[1:17:20] you were born in sin but he said i'm
[1:17:22] giving you new robes
[1:17:24] i'm giving you new clothing because you
[1:17:27] can't get there with these clothes
[1:17:28] clothes on
[1:17:29] and so bags of filth notice he put a
[1:17:32] ring on his son's finger
[1:17:33] and in that day rings wearing rings
[1:17:36] during this time of history
[1:17:37] was a sign of both wealth and position
[1:17:41] so the father here was reflecting his
[1:17:43] desire to restore his son
[1:17:46] as a family member oh
[1:17:49] church aren't you waiting for the father
[1:17:51] to restore that son
[1:17:53] as a family member as a decent person in
[1:17:56] the community
[1:17:56] oh and the family of god god is here to
[1:17:59] restore
[1:18:00] god is waiting to restore and not only
[1:18:02] that but he put sandals on his feet
[1:18:05] so he says i want you son to walk with
[1:18:07] me
[1:18:09] you can walk with me without any fear
[1:18:12] you can walk with me without any worry
[1:18:14] about being contaminated by the things
[1:18:16] of this world
[1:18:17] i want you to walk with me and the last
[1:18:20] that he did was he slayed the fatted
[1:18:22] calf
[1:18:24] no longer would his son settle for the
[1:18:27] slop of the pigs
[1:18:28] but now he would die on the best meat
[1:18:30] available
[1:18:32] oh church what is this story telling us
[1:18:35] tonight
[1:18:37] that this is a fatted calf this is a
[1:18:40] robe of righteousness
[1:18:41] this is a ring of wealth and position
[1:18:44] the bible would tell the prophet of god
[1:18:46] with us he placed upon our hand our
[1:18:48] finger
[1:18:49] that wedding ring of predestinated
[1:18:51] unmerited grace
[1:18:53] what a position we're in
[1:18:56] what a place that we're in tonight to
[1:18:59] know that when the enemy would come in
[1:19:01] god raises up a standard when enemies
[1:19:04] tore your life down it and rub
[1:19:06] you through the muck of the world god is
[1:19:08] here to restore you
[1:19:10] i think about sister trish and brother
[1:19:11] george and i'll forgive me if this
[1:19:13] offends you but i just think about the
[1:19:15] first time i met brother george
[1:19:18] i'm like there ain't no hope for that
[1:19:20] man
[1:19:22] and sometimes we got loved ones we feel
[1:19:24] the same way
[1:19:25] there's no way there's nothing nobody
[1:19:28] can save
[1:19:28] that man look at him he's low down dirty
[1:19:31] run
[1:19:32] not you brother george but that that
[1:19:33] person out there and seeing
[1:19:35] oh he's in drugs and his teeth are all
[1:19:37] messed up and his hair is all messed up
[1:19:39] and he's disheveled he ain't got a home
[1:19:41] he ain't got a car
[1:19:42] he ain't got nothing all he's got is a
[1:19:44] ragged old wife and a ragged old kid
[1:19:46] and he's running them through the muck
[1:19:48] trying to make a living and he's living
[1:19:50] ain't gonna do nothing because he's
[1:19:51] bound by drugs and bound by alcohol
[1:19:53] and bound by sexist and bound by this
[1:19:56] and bowed by that oh let me tell you
[1:19:58] though
[1:19:58] it's not the end of the story god can
[1:20:01] take that same man
[1:20:03] and clean them up and put a robe on him
[1:20:06] and put a ring up
[1:20:07] when he rings a predestinated unmarried
[1:20:10] graceful
[1:20:10] and make him a deacon and clean him up
[1:20:14] and make him a real son of god
[1:20:17] it's not the end of the story
[1:20:24] now satan wants you to think that
[1:20:28] no matter how far god has to go
[1:20:32] he will go
[1:20:35] so it's not the end of the story
[1:20:40] was how can it be brother joe
[1:20:43] nobody's nobody cares
[1:20:48] it's not the end excuse me it's not the
[1:20:51] end of the story
[1:20:54] god has the final say
[1:20:59] for the george god had the final say
[1:21:02] sister trish god had the final say
[1:21:06] we look at those some of our loved ones
[1:21:10] and we wonder why they making these
[1:21:11] choices why are they doing this
[1:21:14] don't they realize who they're hurting
[1:21:17] maybe just maybe
[1:21:20] it's not the end of their story
[1:21:24] see god's not so much concerned about
[1:21:26] all the in-between
[1:21:28] he's worried about the end see the
[1:21:31] difference between us and god he knows
[1:21:33] the end
[1:21:35] and he can sit back and he can look oh
[1:21:38] yeah
[1:21:39] there's going there's coming a day i'm
[1:21:40] going to make my visitation
[1:21:42] because no man can come unless the
[1:21:43] father draws i'm going to go and i'm
[1:21:46] going to shake
[1:21:47] that prodigal son i'm going to go and
[1:21:49] i'm going to shake
[1:21:50] that prodigal daughter you say can god
[1:21:52] go to where they are
[1:21:53] absolutely if he can go to a pigsty
[1:21:59] surely he can go to his address
[1:22:02] surely he can go to his job
[1:22:06] surely maybe in a car
[1:22:10] maybe in the moments he's thinking about
[1:22:12] suicide
[1:22:13] surely it's not the end of the story
[1:22:17] so we find here what a sad story though
[1:22:20] but god said it's not over i got the
[1:22:23] final say
[1:22:24] and we go back and we look at adam and
[1:22:26] eve and we find here that adam and eve
[1:22:28] because they sin now they were being
[1:22:30] evicted from the garden of eden
[1:22:33] eve looking over at her husband adam
[1:22:36] crying tears in her eyes i'm sorry
[1:22:38] honey i did all this i should have not
[1:22:40] listened to the lobby
[1:22:41] of the serpent and i did this and i i'm
[1:22:43] sorry honey i brought you this shame and
[1:22:45] this
[1:22:45] this embarrassment and i didn't know
[1:22:47] what it was going to do and adam's
[1:22:48] embracing his
[1:22:49] nice beautiful blonde hair blue eyed
[1:22:52] wife and they're both
[1:22:52] crying and you know an atom with his
[1:22:54] strong body cauteringly leaned over on
[1:22:56] their bosom
[1:22:57] their tears mingling falling and running
[1:22:59] on the sheepskin and blood dripping down
[1:23:02] but we find god told them he says now
[1:23:04] you partook of that tree and i told you
[1:23:06] don't
[1:23:07] now you got to depart from my presence
[1:23:09] and not only were they crying
[1:23:11] but god looked down and god looked down
[1:23:13] went into me god looked down with
[1:23:14] sympathy
[1:23:15] and god more importantly looked down
[1:23:17] with love and he said that's not it just
[1:23:19] hold up a minute
[1:23:20] i'm gonna put enmity between thy seed
[1:23:23] and the seed of the serpent what was god
[1:23:25] foreshadowing that it's not over
[1:23:27] it's not the end of the story you may be
[1:23:29] leaving the garden
[1:23:30] but god was declared i'm gonna make a
[1:23:32] way that sinful man
[1:23:34] can come back in the presence of a
[1:23:36] living god
[1:23:37] oh you're being pushed out because you
[1:23:39] took of the tree of knowledge but i'm
[1:23:41] gonna make a way
[1:23:43] i'm gonna provide a lamb where you can
[1:23:45] partake of the tree of life
[1:23:46] and you'll never be from my presence
[1:23:48] again
[1:23:51] oh
[1:23:54] i'm gonna put enmity between your seed
[1:23:57] and the seed of the serpent
[1:23:59] so what did god do he accepted the
[1:24:01] substitute of man
[1:24:03] in the garden of eden and that was the
[1:24:05] only way
[1:24:06] was a blood sacrifice blood had to pay
[1:24:10] the price
[1:24:11] and it's still the price today you're
[1:24:14] not going to get in on your merits
[1:24:16] you're not going to get on on your
[1:24:17] family genetics you're not going to get
[1:24:19] in on who's who
[1:24:20] who you belong to it's only through the
[1:24:23] blood
[1:24:26] only through the blood
[1:24:30] let me skip down but you know the
[1:24:32] enemy's there
[1:24:33] go just a little bit longer tonight if
[1:24:35] you don't mind then it means they are
[1:24:36] always
[1:24:38] making accusations accusing
[1:24:42] you are failures
[1:24:45] accusing you and rightly the accusations
[1:24:49] for the most part
[1:24:50] are everyone true because you were born
[1:24:53] a sinner but he doesn't know that god's
[1:24:58] got another plan for your life
[1:25:00] so we find here in john 8 if you go to
[1:25:02] john 8 verse 1.
[1:25:06] jesus went unto the mount of olives and
[1:25:07] early in the morning he came again to
[1:25:09] the temple
[1:25:10] and the people came unto him and he sat
[1:25:11] down and he taught them
[1:25:14] and the scribes and the pharisees
[1:25:15] brought unto him a woman
[1:25:17] taken in adultery
[1:25:21] and when they had said her in the midst
[1:25:23] they say unto him master
[1:25:25] this woman was taken in adultery in the
[1:25:27] very act
[1:25:29] she's a dirty woman we called her
[1:25:31] red-handed
[1:25:33] what were you doing looking caught her
[1:25:36] red-handed
[1:25:36] but not only was it she should have been
[1:25:39] stoned
[1:25:40] he should have been stoned with her but
[1:25:42] they only brought the female
[1:25:44] because that's how satan does it because
[1:25:47] he's get he's talked you into doing
[1:25:49] these things
[1:25:50] but he's only accusing you so we find
[1:25:53] here
[1:25:55] that they said tempting him that they
[1:25:58] might have to accuse him but jesus
[1:26:00] stooped down with his finger
[1:26:01] and he rode on the ground as though he
[1:26:03] heard them not
[1:26:05] and when they continued asking him he
[1:26:07] lifted up himself and he said unto them
[1:26:10] he that is without sin among you
[1:26:13] let him cast the first stone
[1:26:16] and again he stooped down and he wrote
[1:26:18] on the ground notice he wrote twice
[1:26:22] and they which heard it being convicted
[1:26:24] by their own conscience went one by one
[1:26:26] bringing
[1:26:26] in the eldest even unto the last jesus
[1:26:29] was left alone
[1:26:30] in the womb standing in the midst and
[1:26:33] when jesus had lifted himself
[1:26:35] up himself he saw none but the woman he
[1:26:38] said unto a woman
[1:26:40] where are those thine accusers has no
[1:26:43] man condemned thee
[1:26:45] verse 11 she said no man lord and jesus
[1:26:48] said unto her
[1:26:49] neither do i condemn thee
[1:26:53] go and sin no more
[1:26:56] so they brought accusations against this
[1:26:58] moment of adultery and she was caught in
[1:27:00] a very act
[1:27:01] and she should have been stoned but
[1:27:03] jesus stooped
[1:27:04] to the ground and i can just imagine the
[1:27:07] first time he stooped
[1:27:09] he wrote it's not the end of your story
[1:27:14] let he without sin cast the first stone
[1:27:18] stooped back down and he wrote pardon
[1:27:21] because he knew one moment in his
[1:27:23] presence is all it takes
[1:27:26] you may have walked in an adulterer or
[1:27:28] an adulteress
[1:27:29] but you're gonna walk out free
[1:27:32] see satan wants you to think that it's
[1:27:34] the end of the story all these
[1:27:36] accusations come against you
[1:27:37] and he is the accuser of the brethren
[1:27:40] and he's here to
[1:27:41] cover your life with skin or sin excuse
[1:27:43] me and
[1:27:44] scar and deface your life with drugs and
[1:27:46] alcohol
[1:27:47] and sex sins and failed marriages and
[1:27:50] failed relationships
[1:27:51] and bad business decisions and if he
[1:27:53] can't get you there
[1:27:54] he begins to fill your mind with fear
[1:27:56] and nervousness
[1:27:58] and complexes and anxieties and
[1:28:00] depression
[1:28:01] and suicidal thoughts anything that he
[1:28:03] can do to keep you
[1:28:05] a slave to your first birth but i want
[1:28:07] you to know tonight
[1:28:08] it's not the end little bride of the
[1:28:11] story
[1:28:12] oh i'm to tell you where is die accuse
[1:28:14] your little bride
[1:28:16] all the bible will tell us that the
[1:28:17] accuser of the brethren has been cast
[1:28:20] down
[1:28:21] oh little bride you may have done those
[1:28:23] things but in the beginning you've never
[1:28:25] done it in the first place
[1:28:26] but then in the beginning was in the
[1:28:28] mind of god and god saw you perfect
[1:28:30] god saw you sinless god saw you pure god
[1:28:33] saw you the virtuous pride of jesus
[1:28:35] christ
[1:28:36] he didn't see you in dirty old stuff
[1:28:38] because he saw you
[1:28:39] as his beloved wife
[1:28:43] he saw you as his beloved wife
[1:28:47] now notice the devil's there to accuse
[1:28:51] but jesus is there to intercede
[1:28:55] he came to redeem the elected that he
[1:28:57] foresaw
[1:28:58] and satan is there well i got adam to do
[1:29:01] this
[1:29:01] and i got his wife to do this and
[1:29:03] they're guilty but the lamb of god jesus
[1:29:06] christ
[1:29:06] is there to say no they're not because
[1:29:09] in the beginning
[1:29:10] i saw them i knew them they were boned
[1:29:13] in my bone and flesh of my flesh
[1:29:14] i knew what they would be and though
[1:29:16] they come down this way
[1:29:18] it's not the end of the story
[1:29:23] but you know satan will try to make you
[1:29:26] think you cross the line
[1:29:29] he tries to make you think everything's
[1:29:30] wrong with you
[1:29:32] brother ben has this young lady before
[1:29:34] he says you're nervous aren't you sister
[1:29:36] you can't hold it together sometimes
[1:29:38] sometimes you think you're almost going
[1:29:39] to take your life you wonder
[1:29:41] what's going to happen in in your
[1:29:42] religious experiences and so forth
[1:29:44] you've never been satisfied just exactly
[1:29:47] you've always wondered that's right is
[1:29:49] it true and you wanted a closer walk
[1:29:51] with him
[1:29:52] and then sometimes satan has told you
[1:29:54] recently
[1:29:55] when you're in the room by yourself
[1:29:57] you've crossed the line
[1:29:59] he goes i'm not reading your mind but
[1:30:00] that's true isn't it he lied to you
[1:30:03] sister you're healed right now
[1:30:07] and if you can believe the promise of
[1:30:09] god over the live
[1:30:11] enemy you can be healed right now
[1:30:14] it may not be a physical healing that
[1:30:16] you need but it may be a mental healing
[1:30:19] when you quit listening to the lie of
[1:30:21] depression
[1:30:22] and the lies of fear and the lies of
[1:30:24] nervousness and anxieties and complexes
[1:30:27] and you take god at his word
[1:30:32] oh church last brother branham my
[1:30:34] brother man says
[1:30:36] but god sent down from heaven a bleach
[1:30:38] for sin

[1:32:36] tonight we are sons and daughters of god
[1:32:40] let me go just a few more minutes trying
[1:32:43] to find a stopping place
[1:32:44] john first john 3 and verse 1. first
[1:32:47] john 3 and verse 1 says behold
[1:32:49] what manner of love the father has
[1:32:51] bestowed upon us
[1:32:52] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:32:56] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:32:59] because it knew him not beloved
[1:33:01] now
[1:33:05] i said beloved now
[1:33:08] at 8 25 on march the 10th
[1:33:11] now we are the sons of god and it do not
[1:33:15] yet appear what we shall be
[1:33:16] because sometimes the only thing we can
[1:33:18] see is our failures and our mistakes but
[1:33:20] i'm trying to transition your mind from
[1:33:22] looking at your failures
[1:33:23] and looking at your mistakes and begin
[1:33:25] to look at you the way god sees you
[1:33:27] as my son as my daughter or me tell your
[1:33:30] church
[1:33:31] now we are the sons of god oh what
[1:33:34] has the god what has he done he has
[1:33:37] bestowed upon
[1:33:38] us his love he's bestowed upon us his
[1:33:41] title of sonship
[1:33:42] what is god or what is satan bestowed
[1:33:44] upon you nothing but hardships
[1:33:46] nothing but heartaches nothing but
[1:33:48] loneliness nothing but
[1:33:50] fears nothing but depression nothing but
[1:33:52] worry
[1:33:53] and guilt and regret and he's called you
[1:33:55] dirty
[1:33:56] rotten load down good for nothing but
[1:33:58] god is called your son
[1:34:00] he's called your son tonight it's not
[1:34:03] the end of your story
[1:34:04] you're not some dirty low down nothing
[1:34:06] you're sons of god
[1:34:10] god has come and he's changed the
[1:34:12] devil's plans about you
[1:34:13] [Applause]
[1:34:16] he's done wrote a new narrative
[1:34:20] oh we've been reconciled colossians 1
[1:34:22] and verse 19
[1:34:23] for it pleased the father that in him
[1:34:26] should all fullness dwell
[1:34:27] and having made peace through god or
[1:34:29] through the blood of his cross
[1:34:30] by him to reconcile all things unto
[1:34:32] himself by him i say whether they be
[1:34:34] things in earth or things in heaven and
[1:34:37] you
[1:34:38] and you and you come on church and you
[1:34:43] and you we're sometimes alienated and
[1:34:46] enemies where
[1:34:48] in the battleground because you were
[1:34:51] thinking
[1:34:52] like the devil he was thinking like a
[1:34:55] slave
[1:34:56] he was thinking like a born sinner
[1:35:00] who was born in this world shaped in
[1:35:02] iniquity
[1:35:03] and you sometimes were alienated enemies
[1:35:06] in your mind by wicked works
[1:35:07] yet now hath he reconciled you
[1:35:12] do you know what reconciliation means it
[1:35:15] means i'm an accountant so we do
[1:35:16] reconciliation all day every day
[1:35:18] things have to tie out to the very
[1:35:21] minute penny
[1:35:22] so you got a number over here and it may
[1:35:25] be xyz
[1:35:27] and over here is what makes up x y z
[1:35:30] if this over here doesn't equal this we
[1:35:32] don't reconcile
[1:35:34] so what did god say i'm going to
[1:35:35] reconcile my lost sons
[1:35:38] and my lost daughters so he provided a
[1:35:40] blood he provided a bleach
[1:35:42] and now that son can come underneath
[1:35:44] that blood and be reconciled
[1:35:46] you who were alienated and enemies in
[1:35:48] your mind by wicked words
[1:35:49] now he has reconciled you now he's
[1:35:52] declared you sons
[1:35:53] and daughters and so you never sinned in
[1:35:55] the first place
[1:35:58] oh hallelujah
[1:36:02] you needed a lamb and he provided you a
[1:36:04] lamb
[1:36:05] you needed a substitute and what a
[1:36:08] substitute he provided
[1:36:10] but we find now as i bring this down
[1:36:12] down to a close
[1:36:16] in the beginning was the word the logos
[1:36:20] and the word was god and the word
[1:36:23] was with god and in verse 14
[1:36:27] that same word became flesh
[1:36:30] because he knew what it would take to
[1:36:33] redeem
[1:36:34] your sinful soul he knew the cost
[1:36:38] and he counted it because like adam
[1:36:41] he loved this eve but unlike that eve
[1:36:46] this he's not gonna fall she's gonna
[1:36:49] stay true
[1:36:51] going to stay virtuous the bible will
[1:36:53] tell us in first john 3 and verse 9
[1:36:55] whosoever is born of god doeth not
[1:36:57] commit sin
[1:36:58] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:37:01] cannot sin
[1:37:02] because he is born of god
[1:37:06] renews in the mind
[1:37:10] revelations 2 and verse 7 he that hath
[1:37:12] an ear
[1:37:13] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:37:15] the churches
[1:37:18] to him that overcometh will i
[1:37:21] give to eat of the tree of life
[1:37:26] they were pushed out in the beginning
[1:37:28] couldn't partake of the tree of life
[1:37:31] and now in the end time now in the last
[1:37:33] they said brother this is the ephesian
[1:37:34] age
[1:37:35] but every reward of every previous age
[1:37:37] that last
[1:37:38] age receives all that blessing and so we
[1:37:40] find here
[1:37:42] those that overcome and laodicea get to
[1:37:45] partake
[1:37:45] of the tree of life and that's why we
[1:37:49] now have the holy ghost
[1:37:50] the tree of life and there's no more
[1:37:53] separation
[1:37:54] from us and god oh we looked at the
[1:37:57] beginning it was a sad story
[1:38:00] but the story's not over we find here
[1:38:03] brother brown would tell us he says what
[1:38:05] a thrilling thought this
[1:38:06] is the tree of life in the garden of
[1:38:08] eden which could not be approached until
[1:38:10] unto because of the fall of adam is now
[1:38:13] given
[1:38:14] to the overcomer now
[1:38:18] the tree of life is given to you in this
[1:38:21] last age
[1:38:23] so we find now these sons of god who by
[1:38:27] him overcome
[1:38:28] are giving the privilege of the paradise
[1:38:31] of god
[1:38:32] and in constant fellowship with jesus
[1:38:36] see satan satan wants you to think
[1:38:39] there's no
[1:38:40] way of escape
[1:38:43] he's got man corrupted he's got politics
[1:38:45] that he's got governments corrupt
[1:38:47] he's got the world's corrupted he's lied
[1:38:49] to you he's made you feel like healing
[1:38:50] is beyond you holy ghost is not for you
[1:38:52] you can't live above sin you got to
[1:38:54] remain as you are there's no hope
[1:38:57] it tells you there's no hope for you
[1:38:59] there's no hope for you
[1:39:02] see satan when you were born he took a
[1:39:04] pen out and he began to write
[1:39:07] all your failures wrote them down
[1:39:10] accusing you before god but they did
[1:39:13] this
[1:39:15] and andrew tuster did this little
[1:39:17] skateboard punk he did this and he was
[1:39:19] hiding it from his mom and his dad
[1:39:21] drinking booze behind her back
[1:39:22] skateboarding running with the wrong
[1:39:23] friends
[1:39:24] i got it all written down right here he
[1:39:26] took a pen
[1:39:27] and began to chart out things that you
[1:39:29] had done by the sinful nature
[1:39:33] oh and he began to write your story and
[1:39:35] you know he knew a little bit about it
[1:39:36] because he's the one that's talking you
[1:39:38] into it
[1:39:38] and you begin to look at this and you
[1:39:40] begin to look at that and you begin to
[1:39:41] do this and he's there just writing it
[1:39:43] all down and writing it all down
[1:39:44] but one day god snatched the pen away
[1:39:48] from the enemy
[1:39:50] and i believe god not only did it but he
[1:39:52] brought it down through a prophet in the
[1:39:54] pergamum church age
[1:39:55] he says one night i was seeking the lord
[1:39:57] and the holy spirit told me
[1:39:58] to pick up my pen and write
[1:40:03] sometimes we think this is all it is
[1:40:05] this life this is all it is all these
[1:40:06] things that you wrote down devil
[1:40:08] that's me yeah that's me and that's me i
[1:40:09] did this and i did that and i did that
[1:40:12] but god took the pen away from your
[1:40:14] accuser
[1:40:15] he took it away from the enemy and this
[1:40:17] is what god is saying
[1:40:19] about you right now he says in these
[1:40:22] last days
[1:40:23] the true bride church christ seed will
[1:40:25] come to the headstone
[1:40:26] she will be a super church a super race
[1:40:30] as she nears him day in the bride will
[1:40:33] be so much like him
[1:40:34] till they will be in his very image this
[1:40:36] is in order to be united with him
[1:40:39] this will be or they will be one they
[1:40:42] will be the very manifestation
[1:40:44] of the living god from this little group
[1:40:48] of true seed of god god will present
[1:40:50] christ
[1:40:51] with the beloved bride she is the virgin
[1:40:53] of his word
[1:40:54] she is the virgin because she knows no
[1:40:56] man's creeds are dogmas
[1:40:58] and by and through the members we'll
[1:41:00] know this bride will be fulfilled
[1:41:02] all that was promised of god to be
[1:41:04] manifest in a virgin
[1:41:06] satan about your shame but god has wrote
[1:41:08] about your translation
[1:41:10] god has wrote about you in a rapture he
[1:41:11] thrown a bunch in a body chain
[1:41:13] and he's called you the sinless pure
[1:41:16] sinless virtuous blood of jesus christ
[1:41:20] satan's told you low down dirty sinner
[1:41:23] but god is taking the
[1:41:25] pen away and he's changed the narrative
[1:41:27] you're not what the devil says you are
[1:41:29] you're sons and daughters of god you're
[1:41:32] children of god
[1:41:33] you've been redeemed of god
[1:41:39] musicians come he said there'll be a
[1:41:42] time to come forth
[1:41:43] when he would express himself in the
[1:41:46] fullness of the godhead
[1:41:47] deity through his church had the
[1:41:50] preeminence in his church
[1:41:51] oh my what the anointed man
[1:41:55] but now the anointed people amen
[1:41:59] now the anointed people oh my to bring
[1:42:01] back the anointed bride and bridegroom

[1:42:06] down
[1:42:07] and adam coming back with his anointing
[1:42:09] of the word notice now
[1:42:12] what eve turned down was life and what
[1:42:15] you're being presented

[1:42:25] your story

[1:42:28] out there a little rock and roll punk
[1:42:30] running away from
[1:42:31] the church and run away from the family
[1:42:32] and doing god knows what
[1:42:35] but one night on a wednesday night
[1:42:38] he took the pen away from your enemy and
[1:42:40] began to write you
[1:42:42] a new narrative for the philip running

[1:45:46] and daughter of god you're standing
[1:45:48] there washed
[1:45:49] your old book of divorcement is put away
[1:45:51] it's dead absolutely out of the
[1:45:53] existence

[1:45:55] virtuous
[1:45:57] bride of christ washed in the blood of
[1:46:00] christ

[2:02:48] with your heart just a second
[2:02:51] while the holy spirit is just speaking
[2:02:53] the hearts
[2:02:55] i believe that he spoke very direct
[2:02:58] tonight
[2:03:00] putting something upon brother joe's
[2:03:02] heart to minister
[2:03:05] maybe you're right there in a very
[2:03:09] valley of decision maybe you're right
[2:03:11] there at that very place of where you've
[2:03:14] just come into
[2:03:16] where you can make your own choices
[2:03:20] you come to the age of accountability
[2:03:22] jesus met that at about 12.
[2:03:25] maybe you've just come into there right
[2:03:28] into that moment in time
[2:03:32] you're being pulled you begin to feel
[2:03:34] the pull of the world
[2:03:36] to pull us in
[2:03:37] [Music]
[2:03:40] brother joe gave a very very positive
[2:03:42] message tonight
[2:03:44] he told about very very positive endings
[2:03:49] but i want to talk about two young men
[2:03:52] just for a moment
[2:03:53] in the closing of the service there was
[2:03:56] moses he was a rich young ruler
[2:03:59] [Music]
[2:04:02] and he looked over at the treasures of
[2:04:04] egypt
[2:04:06] and he made a choice to go with the
[2:04:08] people of god
[2:04:11] to bear the reproach of god
[2:04:15] rather than to enjoy the pleasure of sin
[2:04:18] for a season
[2:04:19] let me tell you sin only lasts as a
[2:04:21] season
[2:04:22] the pleasures of it
[2:04:26] you never see the end you never see
[2:04:28] where it takes you never see the depths
[2:04:30] of sin
[2:04:31] the song says sin will take you further
[2:04:33] than you want to go
[2:04:35] it'll it'll keep you longer and you want
[2:04:38] to stay
[2:04:41] sure well
[2:04:44] that rich young ruler had a great ending
[2:04:48] but there was another young man that
[2:04:51] walked
[2:04:52] right up to eternal life jesus christ
[2:04:54] himself
[2:04:56] and said what must i do to inherit
[2:04:58] eternal life
[2:05:01] the end of his story when he turned away
[2:05:06] sorrowful because he realized what it
[2:05:08] would cost
[2:05:11] the end of his story didn't end so well
[2:05:14] he lifted up his eyes in hell
[2:05:23] we don't want that to be the end of your
[2:05:24] story
[2:05:26] but the decision's yours you'll choose
[2:05:29] today
[2:05:30] who you will serve
[2:05:34] i wonder if if the lord is dealing with
[2:05:36] you tonight
[2:05:37] and you know you need to make a move for
[2:05:39] god
[2:05:42] you know you need you need a touch from
[2:05:45] him
[2:05:46] you know the things that you've been
[2:05:48] doing that is wrong
[2:05:53] maybe we'll just start this way
[2:05:57] maybe you just raise your hand to to god
[2:05:59] right now and say
[2:06:02] lord i i realize i really need you
[2:06:05] i really need you i really need you
[2:06:08] god sees you he sees you you you
[2:06:12] you you you you
[2:06:14] [Music]
[2:06:29] yes we believe in predestination
[2:06:34] yes we believe that we're called and
[2:06:36] ordained before the foundational world
[2:06:37] but i want to tell you too
[2:06:39] you've got a choice to make
[2:06:43] you've got to choose today who you will
[2:06:45] serve
[2:06:51] i'm going to pray for you right now
[2:06:53] we're going to believe the lord for you
[2:06:56] as you reached out to him he'll reach
[2:06:58] back to you right now
[2:07:00] in jesus name father
[2:07:04] you see the hearts of men and women
[2:07:06] young boys and girls

[2:07:15] audience

[2:07:20] they're realizing i've got them some
[2:07:24] choices some decisions i've got to make
[2:07:26] i've got to do the right thing
[2:07:30] lord may they turn away from sin may
[2:07:32] they turn away from their unbelief
[2:07:34] may they turn to you with all of their
[2:07:35] hearts
[2:07:38] oh god you've convicted their heart that
[2:07:40] made a move towards you
[2:07:42] and i pray now in the name of jesus you
[2:07:45] who have touched their heart tonight
[2:07:47] and they lifted their hand toward you
[2:07:50] and they made that move towards you may

[2:07:54] i pray lord their pillar will be so hard
[2:07:57] they can't sleep i pray lord their
[2:08:01] their life will become so difficult
[2:08:04] because of the conviction
[2:08:06] of the holy spirit speaking in the
[2:08:08] middle of the night and
[2:08:10] during the day you're wrong turn from
[2:08:12] that way
[2:08:13] until they turn back to you i pray the
[2:08:16] angel of god will get a hold of them
[2:08:19] and overtake them and bring them to an
[2:08:22] altar
