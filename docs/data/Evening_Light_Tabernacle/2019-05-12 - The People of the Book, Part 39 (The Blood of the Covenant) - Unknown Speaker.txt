of the greatest joy for parents is to know that our children walk in truth amen and some you know as I was passing along some of the churches coming through and just seeing you know their parking lots

changed in my life aren't you glad for that in your life well it's Jesus zombie [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Applause] you'll turn with me in the Bible this morning we'll get right into the word Hebrews chapter 13 verse 20 and we're just looking to the word today we want the Holy Spirit to speak to us through the word and minister of hearts and lives a man I know this is some special day for many of you and maybe you've got dinner appointments and whatever but we got an appointment with Jesus this morning a man we want to hear from his voice today and let him speak to us hebrews chapter 13 verse 20 now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every way and ever good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen amen turn with me to Exodus chapter 12 and verse three as we look here having read about the blood of the everlasting covenant and that's what we'll be speaking on today the blood of the Covenant we look here in Exodus chapter 12 and we'll read from the third verse was a very serious time in Israel they were leaving Egypt going to a promised land we are also in an exodus hour amen this is a very serious hour that we're in it's a time that we really make a call in an election sure we know where we stand in this hour Exodus chapter 12 and verse 3 speaking to all this congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house and if a household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor neck unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year and you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side post and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs shall they they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs with the pertinence thereof and ye shall let none of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste for it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt Amen may God bless you can be seated as I said this morning we're going to be speaking on the blood of the Covenant as we look here in our opening scenes of our scripture we can see where that death was striking each and God was going to kill all the firstborn of all the Egyptians whether it was man or beast that there would be death there in the camps of the Egyptians there had been great plagues that were already had fallen and you know what boils had broke out fire was falling the rains that come the hail had come but God provided a place for his elect not to have to be a part of that a man he had a place called Goshen and and of course there was now a spirit of death that was coming upon the land and remember you know that's something that we must always realize that we are here in a very similar hour where death is striking the land and Israel would have to have something to keep them from dying that they you know they because of the sin death would strike them too and the wages of sin is death and Israel had sinned just like the Egyptians had sinned as we read quote the scripture all is sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and so so God so that they would not die his people who were trying to follow him he provided for them a lamb and a blood of the door that would protect their firstborn and of course that was God's provided way and that that there was a blood that would atone to keep the death angel from coming in and destroy and bring her death into the home now I want to quote brother Branham and saying this that any religion today that hasn't got the blood life for Jesus Christ behind it the death angel is on it and man the death angel separated from God yes indeedy Ichabod is rowed over every bit of it that hasn't got the bud and if you come under what that is that was when a child was named in Israel because of a great that was there in the time of Eli and the child as though the parents the Eli have died and and the father had died of this child the mother named the child if the Bob meaning the glory of the Lord has been taken or removed from us and so I it has departed so again that the Ichabod is rode on every bit of it he said in other words the glory of the Lord has departed and we we can see the effects in the world that we're living in because of the departing of the glory of God as sin increases as wickedness increases upon the world that we live in that we know that is because that ichabod is written over I religious systems even our governments in the land and ever even our families that the glory of the Lord is to party we see the holy spirit is lifting from the age that we're living in and you say well I'm glad the blood he said if the blood hasn't taken effect if it hasn't taken effect and you see it in your life you know many people claim it and so I'm under the blood I made a profession of faith I joined the church but if you don't see it in your life it hasn't been applied to you hey man so you might even have something else beside the blood you might have a injection of theology or injection of sudden sensation or you say I quivered I shook I danced I've done this he said be careful if the medicine ever strikes you it's good for every human being it man it will say from sin it is it in or clean up from a life of sin it'll make a different person out of you it'll take the doubt away amen you're a new creation in Christ a man it'll make a different person out of you a man and there with death struck evil Egypt our God separated a belief from unbelief and that's what he's doing today by the same blood of the Lamb now for the Israelites was leave in the Egypt was a type of this in time because this is an exodus also there's death in the lamb and let me just say today there is death in the lamb as I wrote read to you Wednesday night about the statistics of Christians who are who are actively seeking out porn and eighty percent and seventy percent fifty percent you don't do it depending on the age groups were that they're feeding on every kind of devilish thing that there is and here it is destroying that their lives is destroying their homes it's destroying marriages and then we have today people that are dying children that are dying marriages that are dying homes that are dying and sexes are dying demons like vultures flying around circling around looking for a place to lamb and I'll tell you what he'll find a place to land on you if there's no blood there hey ma'am I I really I quoted you Wednesday night about but the brannamon where he cast a demon out of Nellie Sanders and he said that demon rose up from her and there were see it you know where were they they come up on her now remember she was a repentant person she had a sweet peace that he come owner she had acts of salvation that had happened to her but she didn't go all the way she didn't get sealed to the day of redemption and so here a spirit took her in a moment of weakness let me tell you you're not strong enough to keep the devil out you're not powerful enough to hold him at bay there's only one thing that will hold him at bay and that's the bud are you in me now it's really important that we understand that even brother Brennan said that that demon rose up out of that woman and he said come out like a bat but black wings and hair hanging off of it oh no and his feet long hair coming down off its wings and feet and flew at him and he said them with the blood of jesus protect me from that you see even the prominent God was not safe outside of the blood and I don't care how good you are how religious you are how right you are in your doctrine how much you believe the message how straight to cross the t's and dot your i's if the blood ink there the towns of hell are on the way you're vulnerable amen now there's deaths in the light and the blood was a token if you notice he said the blood was me a token that's not simply a hard word for you to understand token is a sign it's a sign that there was a death already in that home that the blood of the lamb had atoned for that sin and the token was a sign on the door post that told the death angel keep out keep you can't come in here because why the blood is that because the blood was shed on my account and I've accepted that blood and I've applied that blood and because of that the death angel cannot enter in it's really important that we understand what the token is the token is today the baptism of the Holy Ghost now so the blood was a token or identification identifying this person had been redeemed notice that were redeemed before anything had happened by faith they applied the blood before it actually happened the blood was applied by faith believing that it was going to happen before that wrath of God pass through the lamb the blood had to be applied first it was too late after the blood after after the it was too late after the rat had already fallen we we have a lesson here that we could really maybe bring to your thought just a moment look before it happens before there's coming a time that you'll not be able to have any blood applied right now's the time to apply that blood hey man you know I'd like to look at the Scriptures for a moment because it's going to come to this every one of you will come to this place there is a line that is being drawn and we're getting closer to the edge and one day we will cross this over this line of this krypter right here Revelation chapter 22 and verse 11 I want you to look at this with me he that is unjust let him be unjust steal and he that is filthy let it be filthy still he that is righteous let it be right to steal he that is holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work might be shall be now notice as we're looking at this this is a line any man we're coming right down true this this is why we're trying to get ever so saved so that Jesus can come because this is at the moment of his coming because the next thing I'm behold I come quickly so you see this is event as he comes as he comes as and he appears and he takes his bride those are the righteous there will be rocks a stinger those that are holy will be holy steel but those come on the other side if they're filthy an immoral they'll still be filthy and immoral hey mom you're gonna be left in that condition what in there in that serious situation this is nothing to play with this is where that we realize any moment any moment any moment listen I want to just bear it to you we're over time we're in the last of the last of the last age hey man we're at the finish line we're already over time you don't have another moment to spare hey ma'am I'll tell you can't get in soon enough hey man we're trying to get ever so saved so that Jesus can come he cannot come until that last one that has the name on the book of life that was put there before the foundational world and when that name is called then that's the last one then he came to redeem to bring back redeem means to bring back and and when he brings the last one in he's sitting at the right hand of God gloating brother right now tonight doing his Mediterra work and when that last soul is saved that that was redeemed and seen and knew by God before the foundation world when that last soul is saved that closes the book and then the lamb comes and takes the book out of the right hand of him that sets up on the throne he's coming then he's coming to the earth hey ma'am now I would like to share this another little quotation from the Philadelphia Age because this was a 68 in the eyes of God time is drawing to a close he will soon be coming back soon the cry will go forth as he comes and he that is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous stealing him that is holy let him be holy still soon the cry of the poor what I read to you is a cry that will actually go forth and when it does there's no more going to be saved not another Gentile saved you better get to the blood now Amen because this is the last warning let me tell you there will not be another just in case you don't know it we're in the last church age we're in the last days little children a man there will not be another age after this already the throne room is set up the twelve foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paid I'm talking about God's ready to take the people home and then the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and Hinson like a pyramid ceased and so fair and glorious the heavenly beings who who have prepared her watch breathlessly glistens and shines with the glory that is an earthy every facet of her beauty tells a story of Amazing Grace and Jesus loves he is a city prepared for a prepared people she awaits only for her happiness and soon never thrown her streets with joy and I say how what a day that'll be what a glorious day I remember yes this is the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over that's what we're at being aegis over we've reached the end there's not another to come but as he said but thank God at this moment this age is not over he is yet crying then his cry is not only in the spiritual ears by men by his Spirit but once again a prophet is in the land and once more God will reveal the truth as he did the Paul how many believes that a man in the days of the seven messenger in the days of the Laodicean age the messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed the PAS hey ma'am and he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the benefit effect of that prophets ministry man and David hear him will be blessed they that hear him will be blessed how many feels blessed this morning you are a blessed people and become part of that bride of the last day who were mentioned in revelation 22 70 the spirit and the bride say come hey man I've heard that voice Amen Emeco in it today come the corn of wheat the bride wheat had fell in the ground at night she has come back to its original word grain again praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last days what he says from God the bride will say a man the spirit and the prophet in the bride will all be saying the same thing and man you won't be reading between the lines and getting something the Prophet didn't say but but what this prophet said the spirit said that's why the Prophet said it and the bride will say the same thing not something different not an act it's not adding to it not expanding it hey ma'am they're saying it now that's what the true bride does and it says come out from her and be separate the cries gone out the cries going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age I want you to look over to your neighbor and tell them this is a la stage they ain't no more coming we're at the finish the longing of ever age has been to be at this time the desire of every church every messenger has been to be at this time and you're here any man now there's no bride age after the seventh one and when the seventh eight years the bride age yes days begin with the zuzo Street movement but it is with the bride and her rapture I hadn't even shame that some churches around the message today can't even worship and sing about the literal and physical and corporal coming of Jesus Christ cuz they say he's already come or he come in another form a man but let me tell you he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says and the Spirit is spoken and man and we are looking we are people expecting the return of Jesus Christ do not take that expectation away from the church that has gotta be what our eyes is on you said what brother Tim you know he's come and he's hearing the bride form that's his appearing his coming is in a literal physical body and man we're part of his appearing the Prophet was a part of his fearing them the message was a part of his appearance but his coming is when we will see him when we see him we'll be like him what we'll see him as he is and I'm gonna say today we're here at the last stage the last of the last and it's not over and how can you be so sure because I'm still here and I know he ain't gonna leave me cuz I'm part of him are you with me hey man thank God it's not over yet they're still mercy as yet there's still grace amen but I see his demons are answering people using their body took an either Mouse we better have the blood of Jesus as brother branham himself screamed out when he looked at that bat with longer hairs come and said oh the blood Lord God the blood of Jesus Christ protect me from that we've got to have the mud that's insanity in the world and that's not my only concern there's insanity in the pulpit it's insanity to say we're not in the seventh age any longer it's insanity to pretend we're over in an eighth age somewhere it's insanity to say we're in the eighth day when you're obviously not you're right here once you tell my body it's in the eighth day it ain't and neither are you hey man we might have had two redemptions process and and have the Eternity done within our soul and I'll give you that I can also give you we've had the Moline am the eternal Sabbath rest that happens or so but we ain't in the Millennium when and they say either we are right here in the seven churches under the seventh angels message and it's insanity to say anything different spiritual insanity hey man and they saying well you know we got preachers in the pulpit today say they're saying we're not in Laodicea no more and your churches are dying and you got young people in trouble and there's still sickness in the body and we still don't have our body change and yeah and we're still having to fight against lukewarmness and you can't get people to Turks on Winston either I'm hardly Sunday anymore and you say oh we're we're not allowed to see my friend you are to see a man saying well Jesus is no longer the seed of mercy that's insanity a man saying the Christ is not the place where God chose to put his name but now it's in my group that's insanity a man the second coming of you know it is Christ coming in in a bride and and there's no literal coming that's insanity my church here in Brides forms and it's series in the church sure where his body upon the earth but he's got a body that sits there on the throne of intercessory intercession for us the high priests that can be touched by the peels of our infirmity and somebody that pay the price for us that is black we're all lost well we don't need not bleeding sacrifice today I need I need a matter ow hey man you can't look to some church to forgive your sins and my not spiritual insanity and mine we've got to have Jesus we must have him hey man the the bride is not the Catholic married that now does his intercessory work that's insanity she's not to see the mercy he is she is a redeemed not the Redeemer she is him but he is not her a man she cannot do his work his work is his atonement and her work his faith in the atonement amen sure we can intercede on the behalf of others that's what prayin is all about amen believers interceding through prayer about a need but the bride isn't the intercessor and then there's only one that God hears and that Caesars Christ and we approach hip God through his sacrifice you cannot come in the other way I hear brother branham in perfect faith I am your brother standing as your brother and intercessor trying my best to hold you before God and I'm standing right here before the white throne now and pointing my finger to that bloody sacrifice there and speaking through his name that is done that's the only way that we have power a remission of sins is pointing people to Calvary rathas fallen the mind of satan has taken over he's using bodies to tempt to destroy to kill and to speak Revelation chapter 17 verse 13 says they have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast now so they they will give their power they actually give their power they yield or the yield their bodies even even their noin ting to the Beast listen we're in the time where wrath is falling on the land somebody with me therefore is the evening shadows are appearing and the rafters ready be poured out for long high up on ungodly nations upon ungodly believers the professor's without a possession of all these things brother Brennan said I've tried to unfold myself and live right among it to see that where it was standing before I said these things but now we're living in the shadows and I'll tell you what the shadows ain't got nothing but deeper demon powers and demon forces ain't got nothing but worse so though darkness is wool is even more than what it was when he was here professors without a possession wrath being poured upon the ungodly believers professors were out of possession we're living in the shadows and the rats is ready to strike and God is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost it is the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass because it's the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back to the believer hallelujah you see animal I couldn't do that the woolly lamb couldn't do that but we got a better sacrifice we have a greater atonement we've got a better covenant only one required blood in the Old Covenant it requires blood in the new covenant and without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sins hey man it has to show that a life had died that you have accepted the death of a lamb in your place now brother Branham would followed up his sermon on the token with a message called desperate and he said I would imagine the children when they saw them big black wings dropped down from the sky that smoke settling over the city can you imagine that screams coming up from every house the children mother went to the daddy and daddy and said daddy are you sure we're under that token he'd go the door and he'd look at the post the lentil and say son it's according to his word remember I'm your oldest child daddy are you are you positive I'm positive that according to what the Prophet told us in the ELSA word the Lord when I see the blood I'll pass over you take a lamb for the house I brought all you children in you're my oldest but my firstborn and that's the ones that are dying out there but there is the bud and I just want to say we can see dance and die never where we can see that that our homes are being invaded by demons we can see the churches are invaded by demons we can see everywhere that demon invasion has taken over the minds of people and they're giving their mind and their power and their Street to the Beast are you with me protection there is a place of safety [Applause] [Music] how many daddies are ready you got your stuff in your hand if you prayed up can your child see that you're getting ready I wonder if they can tell we're getting ready to leave we're not planning on staying we're planning on leaving we're going in an exodus listen it's never type of the Bible a man and we are the anti-type which means with the fulfillment of that type so that was actually proper sign of us come on didn't we have a prophet with a pillar of fire and then we have a voice that spoke to us in our day and our own voice behind the sign then we have two signs that was shown or the sign in the hand and the end the hunger and the the binding of the serpent didn't we see that happen come on church amen haven't we had a messenger in this day a man then we have got instructions or what to do and that is to get bad knees that blood because anything out from under the bloody Chabad is going to be rolled over them instead of blood being their sign it'll be a sign that the glory of the Lord has departed I wonder husband can your wife see it I wonder a wife can your husband see it what are we looking for what kind of families what kind of people are we to be how serious we are in a very serious moment child is it daddy where you got your shoes on what do you got your stuff in your hand what do you get that unleavened bread in your hand and the lamb and the other how come you how can you steer always in that word searching things out and see them making your call and election sure and seeing if there's leaven in the home hey man I'm gonna tell you I can tell there's a lot of you haven't been checking for leaven in your home a man because there's a lot of leaven been showing up that we've had to deal with and it's only because of neglect are you with me hey man but when you're desperate you know you're eating those bitter herbs and you realize the death angels coming I've got to be prepared I've got to make it ready man what's a sweet runnin off your face man how come you're in such a desperation wow why are you so serious about that it's time to get serious I mean you can't plate Turks anymore this is about getting serious with God putting everything you've got into it why don't why are you eating that unleavened bread of sincerity and truth because we got to bind the serpent and you ain't gonna bind him without that sincerity and truth' somebody help me breathe and to do that brother it takes the eating of the bread come on this is Paul's teaching and man the bread of sincerity and truth he said this is Christ as our Passover and the Passover is observed with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth Wow cuz we gonna have to find the serpent in this age he's after our kids he's after our newborns you know I I have to bring my cattle up close to my house to yesterday and the day before because the buzzards had got to one of our little baby calves just newborn they'll get them really they just flock over them they're just flock over them and they'll try they'll try to did to kill him as it coming out the birth canal they'll eat him alive newborn babies newborn calves I looked up this morning there was about a dozen of them flopped around a cow and I looked and I can see a newborn baby you think me as a Good Shepherd just gonna go so y'all y'all Buzzard have a good picnic you think I would be a good farmer to do that no I went and got me a weapon hey man I wouldn't got me a weapon and then you gonna let the buzzards come in your home you gonna let the vultures get your kids you're gonna let the vultures haul off your family come on you gonna let demons coming over take you time you pick up your weapon I mean even Abraham when he slew the sacrifice he had to keep the birds and the fowls of it and you gotta keep it out of your worship per se you'll know you mean what's have been in a video game or some sex pornography thing what's up ball game yes without the other you worship one thing and that's God [Applause] my life is presented to God son deaths is fixing to strike so we're in an hour of desperation brother Branham would tell us I believe after breaching the token message we want to get into that for a while this morning you just pray for me just say I'm just not safe pray a little prayer just right now say God help brother temple to say the right things today to get to the points that needs to be covered he says I believe we're living in the days or otherwise the days that we're living in should cause the church to go completely in the desperation I believe since this message which was on the token this morning from God not me listen from God not me I believe it on it so this entire congregation in the desperation that we have played long enough we went to church long enough we got to do something hey mom oh you say brother dim brother branham against going to church that's not what he's saying if you got that out of it you missed it mmm but what it is is we we played long enough we pretended long enough hey man we just went to the church and went through the motions long enough this time we make it count [Applause] we gotta do it it's a serious hour how is that we can see these other signs and wonders done on others and what about us hey man you say what brother Tim there was demons cast out and that meeting we just in yeah there was but what about you have you dealt with your demons come on hey man you say well you know brother Tim you know you know you know a lot of people that sit back there legalistic and and say I look at that you know look at all that trouble in in that church look at that people that ain't what they're supposed to be what about you writing it down to home you know quit pointing at everybody else it look at your own self so I don't come to church saying there's too many hypocrites well you've got to be some you've got to be something you know smaller than what you hide behind so you're smaller than they are if you're hiding behind the hypocrite right amen so again the signs of his coming it should that bring this entire congregation when we read it from the words and we can see signs of his coming hey man Holy Spirit tell us go to a certain place such as such things not not tell us what it was but it would happen we'd go there it happens this way newspaper Packard magazine packet show the pictures of it come back see these great mysteries hidden in the Bible open to us on a new field that we never knew before and purfling perfectly blends into the coming of the Lord Jesus now what we read about today was about a Passover simply means that they when the Death Angel passed over the house passed over because of the blood I would should understand we're in another Passover because the death angels all around hey man now the Passover represented it typed out salvation because it was it was a salvation from death right but in order for it to be effective it must be fully applied now partially fully applied now there was the examining of the Lamb that we read about it was taken up on the tip day keppen to the 14th so the lamb was killed after give up for three days like to read it to you in Exodus chapter 12 verse 21 and we'll we'll read the description of what he would have them to do now this is the whole order of salvation the salvation from it from the death down in Egypt we want to look at this because it was a type of our own salvation then Moses called for all the elders of israel said unto them draw out and take your lamb according to your families and kill the Passover so remember it's a lamb for a house and that is not good enough to do it at the church every family must have the land it's not just a church attendance thing every family every house must have a lamb now let me bring it down beyond your dwelling then let's bring it down to this house this flesh every house must have a lamb hey man are you with me ever house ain't good enough your mama's got it and good enough your daddy's got it are they good enough your kids is the one that's got it you gotta have the land man you said well they did that I'm talking about them I talk about you this ain't about what others are doing with Jesus this is about water yellow light red Jesus well you don't know what people have done to me I could care less what people have done to you I'm sorry for your heartaches and your troubles but friends and your real problem ain't them people your real problem is your own self you're gonna have to deal with the devil inside a mountain coz ever want to be a born with sin nature and you got to deal with that devil now I want you to listen draw out take a lamb according your families kill the Passover and you shall take a bunch of high septon and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lentil and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out the door of his house until the morning stay under the blood till we leave we're leaving in the morning hold that bright and cloudless morning when the big rush arise a man stay in there until under the blood until we leave to get the call to come on out but the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians and whom he when he seeth the blood upon the lentil and on the two side posts the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in your house to smite you so now we got a lot of steps in here that maybe you overlooked the lamb was examined it had to be a perfect lamb a man I don't think we can get a more perfect lamb than Jesus Christ hey man everything everyone had to say he's without blame Pilate said I find no fault in the lamb has been examined I would like to submit that you know we went over and over and over through the ages examining the lamb talking about him how perfect he was how good he was how he healed how he was without blemish we've had a lot of sermons on the land Jesus is not gonna save you what's gonna save you is when his life comes into your life hey ma'am the blood was then collected in a basement so now we got a good collection collectors meeting going on I got the blood I've got a collection I I have the blood in the basin then the blood was dipped in high suppori hyssop and the blood was applied in the doorposts of the lentil hey man now that's what's shown on the outside on the inside is the eating the lamb and the unleavened bread and preparations made to leave all of this is a part of it now all of this is a part of steps to fulfill in the Passover salvation to be saved from death is to escape the coming wrath now Brent wrath is coming you just think things have got bad with school shootings and people going crazy and shooting up you know schools and innocent people and people dying in all kinds of trouble going on and insanity insanity everywhere you just think it's bad now just wait until all hell is loosed and man we're just weird to wait to those things that have been placed in the imagination of people that got in their spirit realm become to be Mallett come out of it to haunt them and to torment them when they realize I am still filthy and there's no way to get clean and still unholy enough righteous and there's no one nothing hurts me I miss my chance all these other steps are good examine the lamb it's a perfect sacrifice without blemish that's good he is a worthy lamb making a profession of faith is good a man guarantee the the hyssop was good got a habit collecting the blood and the basin was good got to do that applied the blood with hyssop is it's a is the type or represents faith now what she gives us it represents faith where you can't apply the blood without hyssop you cannot apply de life the blood the Holy Ghost without hyssop without faith without faith it's impossible to please God hey man now but I'll tell you you can have all the hits if you want and wave it in the face of the Death Angel and say I believe I believe I believe in Christ I believe it's a perfect lamb I believe you can wave that you've got all this space I believe a prophet I believe the Holy Ghost huh I believe in all of it but without blood on that hyssop unless the Holy Ghost comes and your nights with your face and gets applied to your life the Death Angel still got you you can stand out and wave all the hits of you all the death angels still coming in your land when I see the black just as Israel needed hyssop you must also have the blood applied you need the hyssop but you gotta apply the blood your faith wasn't given to you to accept the creed or a statement of faith the hyssop without blood is this hyssop believe it in the message is not enough follow my thinking now just for a moment believing the seals are open it's only hyssop your faith is not to be in the seals you didn't hear what I said did you your faith is not to be your faith for salvation is not in the seals and understanding those mysteries your faith is not in the seals your faith has to be in the blood that was shed Presley for you hey ma'am your faith must be anointed plunge depth if the blood the Holy Spirit and then the blood the Holy Spirit applied to sit out the death angel striking the doorposts with hyssop that isn't draw dipped in blood will accomplish nothing you can proclaim but I'm bride let me tell you the only way your bride is that you're under the blood not because of you you ascribed a certain set of teachings you've been educated into the message but because you met Christ do you hear me there are spiritual Israelites today who claim to believe and have a hyssop in their hands but are not a trace of the blood and because of this you see the Death Angel is all over them it comes in their house it enters through the eye uses tools of the of the enemy to set before your eyes evil things it comes in your house with television with Hollywood dress with makeup with pornography with slothful lazy lies no desperation no sincerity no dedication I'm a superintendent limiter of Mother's Day sermon it's one of the greatest I'll ever preach because he the greatest desire of a mother is to see her children walk in truth you can't just imagine you're safe you've got to be saved from wrath see the Death Angel all over people's lives you can see it in the way they dress the way they act the way they conduct themselves the death angels dare it's got a snare about a Gotham you got a chokehold on them it's gonna be too late when we're gone I'm gonna announce to this church this morning I'm leaving I'm not staying here I have no plans to stay here hey man I'm not gonna be your pastor in the tribulation and then man you gonna go with me you're all going with me what about the rest of you going with me [Music] hey man we need to be making preparation get our stuff in our hands shoes on our feet because the death angels coming through you don't think here this marriage is best in a part homes that are busted apart fornication and adultery living in sin going on pretending that we're Christians live an adulterous fornicating dirty filthy lives living in sin and yet I believe you Jesus you're just waving hyssop but brother to him I tell you I believe the message well let me read you what brother Branham said in the token message he said apply it church now don't fail will you now don't don't don't let the Sun set don't don't don't don't rest day or night don't take no chance it won't what children it won't work you must have the token there you say ah I believe yeah I go ah yeah I believe the message that's alright but that's good but you must have the token do you hear Branham Tabernacle you must have the token gets right it's not enough just to have it collected in the bowl and somehow you know wewe got something stuff there was a lamb died there for that man and sin as bad as midnight you must have a listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that I believe the message obey you obey that messenger come in the crisis that well but I believe every word said brother Branham that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it in your heart that you must have the token the very light that was in Christ being you when I see that I'll pass over you a man by faith they applied the blood see before it was actually happened the blood was applied by faith believing it was going to happen for the wrath of God pass through the land the blood had to be applied it was too late after the wrath had fallen like Noah's dark I didn't Noah's Ark the door was shut and there comes a time that God shuts the door the door shut and when it is Satan is sealed out I wonder when the door is shut to your heart are you with me a man Satan is sealed out judgment waters are sealed out they can't get into you the rabbit is coming can't get to you because why the door is shut shut the door no man can open it no can open it no demon can open it when Satan has sealed out he can't use your body he can't use your tongue he can't use your boss the Bradham said in the breach he said a seal signifies ownership the seal has a mark on it it shows ownership when you were bought by the blood of Jesus Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world you are owned by God man how many can say that's what I want to be owned by God his property man because when he owns you he puts a sign in your life that says keep out [Music] devil you take stanniehumber oh no no the blood has been applied your own by God another thing a seal is a security a seal means you're secured if you don't believe in eternal security I don't know but a seal signifies security to its destination and the Holy Spirit seal cannot be broken you all were you all heard me say that people said the devil made me do this no no that devil didn't do it you just wasn't sealed in so that because when you are sealed in he is sealed out now you went out to him he couldn't get into you because the only way he could get to you as they come to the same process that you have he'd have to be saved sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost that he'd be your brother he didn't do it no you just went to the borderline and come back lesson for the things of the world never went all the way in the Canaan you see across Jordan death to self that's a whole problem note this when the blood is up correctly applied the Holy Ghost is on your doorpost the entry to your soul and there's no ain't no death angel gonna get past that seal are you with me God's only provided place of worship brother bread and said now this is my pinch just a little bit and I feel it pinching quite a bit this morning but you know I've learned to preach whether you say outro me or hallelujah this may pitch just a little bit notice don't fall out with me just remember when Israel once looked on that door with that blood on the door the name the blood the life and entered him under that blood they never went out again until they went out of Egypt grieve not the Holy Spirit of God where where in you go in and don't go out anymore until the day you are redeemed out you know the Bible is always right he puts his word in there and you've got to place it out where it goes to make it to make the hope picture of redemption see grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto your redemption til you're redeemed you're sealed in there you're redeemed your beneath the blood you don't go out no more and then what what are you God's son the end the family seal him by the Holy Spirit the devil couldn't get to you if he had to and you are buried and your life is hidden God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost how's he gonna get to you how you gonna get out there that's it brother went that Holy Spirit seal is there you don't go out no more and he don't get in hallelujah the blood the Holy Ghost is your protection against the Death Angel a man now if you was ready for a Baptist sermon this morning your Baptist time is up we're gonna keep preaching a man to the rest of you that ain't Baptist and the rest of you can get the Holy Ghost in your life man and then you can just take all the word when it comes hey ma'am I I'm not doing off of the Baptist it could be Methodists or Presbyterian or Pentecostal we need to be sons and daughters of God is that right not denominational Christian born-again Christians now this is the evening time at the age that we live in evening time for the church he said it's evening time for me evening time of my message I'm dying I'm moving out I'm moving out I'm going in the evening time of the gospel we come up through justification and so forth but this is the time that the token has to be applied now listen this I told you last Sunday I had something I want to talk to you about and this is it the time that when you just keep playing with it it's gotta be done if it's ever going to be done it's got to be done now because we can see the wrath is about ready to pass through the land and everything from under that token that's the blood the Holy Ghost will perish it's on the Passover time there was a lamb that was slain the blood was collected placed in the basin but then it must be dipped in the hyssop and applied and displayed on the doorpost as a sign or a token that the lamb had died now understand in our day we don't have the chemistry of the blood but we have the life of the blood we have to dip our faith in Christ in the Holy Ghost and pride the Holy Ghost to the doorposts of our hearts are you with me without the blood determinate the book is a nun effect hey man now people are Wonder dangers and what we've got the book we've got the word we got the word we got the word and they don't have to but email them without the blood the word that's not fact it ain't yours unless you're doing to it by the blood the blood is what connects you to the world so you can claim I believe the message I believe I believe I believe all you want to but in you and the only way you can and you can really be in is to be connected by the Holy Ghost by experience with God yourself now so in the Passover time a lamb was slain the blood collected placed in a basement but then had to be displayed as a sign that the lamb had died and its blood had been accepted in your place without the blood the Covenant the book is it not in effect now we're here again we can go and talk all we want to well the seals are open the books been taken and the seals are revealed but it had it is not yours unless you're joined to it by the blood unless you're joined to it by a birth by the Holy Ghost it is not yours it's just like it's just like you know that you know when with my when my father died or you know your parents died or whatever there was a wheel right and there there's a wheel you know now I've come all of y'all didn't show up to the wheel when it was red where my parents died cuz he wasn't his offspring you deformed to him what nothing in that book of his will yours so of course you didn't hear about it and if you did hear about it you didn't even bother to show up coming right cuz your name wasn't in the book you know people want to say well it's for everybody let me tell you unless you're enjoying by the bud I meant the reason why that I was in my family's my father's book of inheritance and somebody with me amen is because I was born of his blood and because I was born of his blood I had a right to inherit from it you have no right of inheritance from God unless your power knob is black you have to be enjoined to the Covenant by the blood the Holy Ghost otherwise it's not for you until that happens you can go you sit there like a and I no wonder sometimes how many people have sat there in meetings and servers after service and their name didn't get called the message never stirred their heart never moved on well you know it may be that we just ain't got down to your name yet but today you happen to be here one more time right now you can hear your name [Applause] without the bun the Tevin it is not an in effect it's a Bible it's a book but it ain't yours got a little good things in it but it ain't yours got some nice property in it but it ain't yours until you get born again it must be applied the blood cannot just be kept in a bucket somewhere can't be some kind of secret boy about we just can't put the Holy Ghost in a bucket and sit it over in the corner it's got to be applied now Israel didn't just go up and say well I tell you what you know it'll be a privilege today to hear Moses speak you know we'll just get over here we'll get the Goldbergs and and the Joneses and the rest them you know we'll go up and Moses gonna speak today if that wasn't there it's not about a personality following my mind it's about it's not even about coming together to talk about the message it's about get beneath the bat well what do you think about it you know my fellow Jews what do you think about a mr. Levinsky what do you think about it what wonder what do you think about when that blood kicked down the Holy Ghost tent down in the audience and moved over a little lady and gave a victory in her heart and that cancer that had her played I'm not talking fiction here I'm talking about what really happened and that devil couldn't stay because of the bird well I think that's pretty good God heals cancer God God delivers God yeah you know you know Moses I I saw them frogs come out of that that one time I don't know it just happened it didn't happen till they said it and I know it's too over God well that's fine well are you circumcised hole yes sir you believe here yes sir but you got to get beneath the blood because none of that seeing the miracles of signs and wonders and take it stop the gods among us all of that it is not gonna work you got to have the bud a man no matter how much you believe you got to come into covenant with God yourself you got to get beneath the blood now brother Branham said you've got to come under the blood now don't just talk about it receive it hear me hear me in the name of the Lord hear me gotta come beneath the blood he's not responsible for any persons from beneath the blood God made it clear that all from under that blood will perish now you say but you know brother TMI we've cast out Devils in his name I we preach the gospel he's gonna say too many depart from me you worker nickel iniquities I'd never knew you he only recognizes the token are you with me and Matt brother Brendan said he was sitting down in the woods and the boys was wandering in here two days you didn't even shoot a squirrel what's the matter he said that was it God said place it upon him upon them said you talk to me about it now it's in your lap it's in yours he won't recognize nothing but that covenant of the Holy Spirit you can't receive you can't cannot receive that cabinet unless you're saved sanctified and baptized in that body he will not you might have an impersonation you might feel good I think sometimes that's a problem we just pray long enough till we get the feeling a little better Nellie Sanders got to bring down the butch at that little sweet peace come on jump up and down speaking terms dancing the spirit I don't have one thing to do with it share it in the name of the Lord God don't recognize that heathens do that witches do that you say now here to come to the other side I'm a scholar and brother have we made scholars out of people around the message we've drilled it and we put it in weave we pressed it down we taught them this and we taught them that all of that teaching is not the token man the token is a personal experience with God that changes your life not educating you into a doctrine but didn't you feel with life some of you have heard it since she was a child on your mother's knee but it's my dad he's gonna save you one bit since he said he's the devil don't scare how much a scholar you are he is - hey man he only recognizes a token now listen that's the message of the app that's the message of this day that's the message of this time in the name of Jesus Christ receive it [Music] brother Brendan said the in evening time message is to apply the token that's the assets I wonder sometimes that we miss the message educating indoctrinating teaching all of that is good but if you miss that life you ain't nothing but a Pharisee a good Amish some Mennonite boy her girl taught how to conform you've got to have the life notice they were not just yet to come together to talk about the message and that's what we've done we've done a lot of talking about it they come together to apply the blood apply the token now brother Branham after he preached the seals he evaluated his own church and and he spoke I'm a you know just before his token sermon he would tell his son that his church Sunday I've got something I've got a present to you I've gotta talk to you and this is what he said he said when we come here we are here for one specific purpose this is the house of correction this is the throne this is a throne of God and gentleman goes forth from the house of God and here's what we come together gather in love with one another as only Christians can love but in here we're under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost is among us and we're here to take reckoning among us to see where our short places are our shortcomings and how we can catch from where we should be or over to where we ought to be now where we are and where we ought to be and that's what we study ministers study those places for their people when they see the people the lack then they begin all that hey ma'am I take case study for you that's why it takes a preaching hey ma'am - do what - find your laps to show you where you are and what you ought to be hey ma'am you're the brother madam would say some things so brown and tabernacled you know we hear this sermon that is preached just what's more Lord just what's more Lord we apply that to Pentecostals they're blinded you know they can't see they sold out to a woman brother bang preach that to his church he said this is what's happening to the whole movement let's make just some isolated Pentecostal group this is all of us it was first preached that brother branham's Tabernacle as a deceit Church by the world I believe the term just wants more Lord refers to us today the restored Church [Music] somebody back out brother branham would preach about it he would be he would preach about God restoring restoring the glory to the church I want to show you I want to show you a sign I want to show you a sign Mariah are you here stand up then Mariah this is a little girl lost all her glory this is a little girl here a little virgin girl that the devil took away her glory she had alopecia would totally bald-headed doctor said it would never come back hey man but she's a sign among us did somebody hear me Prince [Applause] we are people to our original [Applause] Saint Laurent the chlorophyll here she a society bracket I bet God is restoring the glory to his touch again hallelujah that's a same grade in the beginning the last days hey man it's come down from pagan to Wesley on the Pentecost season from glory to glory producing the hidden matter and he said and now it's ripe to bring him back it softly like he was at the beginning his same ministry the same Jesus the same power the same Holy Ghost the same one that came on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost as manifested today from glory unto glory under glory and back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same sign same wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation it's some glory to glory and the next will be are you ready for the next the next will be changed from this glory and to a body like his own glorious body where we shall see him I remember I remember that day when I preached I brought out 1st Corinthians 11 that a woman's glory is her hair and the Bible said she is not to cut it a mile on preaching Bible I'm not preaching churchianity I'm preaching Bible we're talking about what the Bible said hey man you all this other death in the camp that's so that's somebody else's business I'm not preaching death I'm preaching life hey man same thing it tells a man that he's not to have long hair he's to cut it off you know the Holy Ghost will make a man a man masculine and make a woman feminine oh yeah it really will that's what the holy ghost will do but I was preaching that day and I'd mentioned that that hair is a woman's glory well I said why would you want to trim that glory off and I looked out there after preaching that sermon it was just part of my sermon that they know inspiration the Lord gave it to me and then I looked out there and saw that little bald-headed girl with a little cap on her head and I said just like right this ain't right that child of God the daughter of God a daughter that came be robbed of her glory what the Bible tells us that that's her glory and the devil have robbed that and I said weird not standard for it cuddled down here Mariah will laid hands on her that day and rebuke that devil the process was beginning right there things begin to happen the cops have God's wheels prophecy was taking place and here she stands today with restored glory and relax oh wow but we said there's no culture there's no statement there's no devil that is going to take the glory away [Applause] risen king mother son Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever ah you know I can say why God don't care about such a small thing is that you remember their people right here in this church can remember that God called out a woman whose name was Mary over that I won't call her last name but you all know who I'm talking about a lot of you do Mary was a beautician now lives up in the Indiana somewhere I don't know her but anyway make quite a change but stop short of the token a man stopped short of getting the Holy Ghost I met her and her husband my office one day she was so agitated and angry just so but on her nerves and anger and on the eggs speaking to me and the Holy Spirit came down on that room and Satan was cast out I remember just like it was yesterday and after that devil was cast out news there was a sweet peace came upon her she was sat down in the chair what sound asleep for over an hour while my husband and I spoke she got up from there different person and I took the scripture and I said you've had your problems now as a beautician you think you know everything about it but here's what the Bible said I said now don't you ever cut your hair again problem was she got emptied out but didn't get filled with the Holy Ghost what long that the devil started coming back little by little scratching at the door she let it in here and let it in there then again flirtin with she thought she knew everything about Herod she was a beautician she's looking at her hair one day this is say nothing wrong with cutting man I need her dead ends here I'll just cut them off her husband was getting ready for work that day she was coming her hair getting ready to go to church looking how I'm gonna cut this off you know you don't mean nothing to God he just kind of looked at her didn't say a word knew better didn't say anything she was feisty he just looked over at her she said I'll knocked out other eye out of you so but I'll tell you what I'm gonna go to church today and if we'll find out whether God cut cares about that or not said I'll go to church I'll make a deal with him if brother Tim don't say nothing about hair I'll know there's nothing wrong with it that God don't care it'll be our sign she marches herself in church and sits down in the service and I'm in the middle of my sermon and I stop it in the middle and I look at her and I says in that right sister Mary you remember that day in that office when God told you not to cut your hair again you remember what God did for you that day don't you dare forget it and she broke down crying she doesn't wield it in her seat cried and I went to her after church and I said sister I didn't mean to call you out and embarrass you today she supposed him no you didn't embarrass me you exposed the very things that was in my heart I meant God cares but sometimes later the dip to come back but let me just tell you Church let's talk about you this morning let's talk about that restored glory that God's doing brother Benton said but Gary is a new generation coming on now Samson's hair has grown out right now there's a new generation that is rising up right now people that the original glory is coming back to the
