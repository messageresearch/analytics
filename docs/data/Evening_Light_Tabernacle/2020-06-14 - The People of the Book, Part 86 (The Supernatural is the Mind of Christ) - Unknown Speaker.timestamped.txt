[11:00] [Music]
[11:13] amen the lord been good to you amen are
[11:16] you happy this morning happy to be in
[11:18] the house of the lord and
[11:19] it's always a privilege to come to the
[11:21] house of the lord and to
[11:23] gather together with friends and family
[11:26] of like precious faith
[11:28] amen it's what it's all about to worship
[11:30] our god and our savior
[11:31] and our creator and i don't think we
[11:33] should ever let our focus get off of
[11:35] that
[11:35] what church is really about is about him
[11:38] you know church is not really about our
[11:40] comfort or what we want or how we want
[11:42] it to be or how we think it should be
[11:44] church is about him amen and i believe
[11:47] that ought to be our attitudes and
[11:49] you know in saying that i just want to
[11:51] just say once again and remind you
[11:53] that we are under restrictions in our in
[11:56] our assembly
[11:57] and uh we're under restrictions as far
[11:59] as government's concerned
[12:01] there's you know i know a lot of things
[12:03] are going on this world and we got a lot
[12:05] of opinions about that
[12:07] but no matter what our opinions are you
[12:09] know there's things that we still have
[12:11] to abide by and have to
[12:12] have to follow and guidelines we have to
[12:14] follow and
[12:15] in doing so we have to have the deacon
[12:17] set you in certain places and it may not
[12:19] be your favorite place
[12:21] but i'm happy to be here i'll be honest
[12:23] with you sitting up here is not my
[12:25] favorite place to sit
[12:26] i'd rather sit out there somewhere and
[12:28] get comfortable hide behind somebody
[12:30] whatever you know i mean i it's not my
[12:32] personality to want to sit up here on
[12:34] the platform
[12:35] i'm sure not brother aaron's or brother
[12:37] joe's or have the cameras on you every
[12:38] move you make and what you do what
[12:40] you're not doing how you're looking how
[12:41] you're not looking
[12:42] it's not a fun place to be i'll trade
[12:45] places with you
[12:47] amen but i know i know not all but some
[12:50] have voiced it that they're not happy
[12:52] with the way things are going but i'm
[12:53] sorry
[12:54] we cannot do anything about that and so
[12:56] if you'd quit
[12:57] giving our deacons a hard time they
[12:59] don't like their job either and how they
[13:00] have to operate and how they're having
[13:02] to do
[13:03] and if we can just just settle in and
[13:04] realize what church
[13:06] is really about it's not about our
[13:09] comfort it's not about our comfort zone
[13:11] it's about him and where he what he what
[13:14] he means to me and if god really means
[13:16] something to you
[13:17] you could care less what seat you sit in
[13:20] you can care less who you're sitting by
[13:21] what seat you're sitting in if it's cold
[13:23] if it's hot if it's this that any other
[13:26] it's our focus gets off is when we start
[13:28] caring about these other things let's
[13:29] get our focus on god
[13:31] amen don't give our deacons a hard time
[13:34] their heart jobs hard enough
[13:36] amen and just pull together and saying
[13:38] that i said that because
[13:40] this coveted worthy whatever your
[13:42] opinion is is a real thing
[13:44] and there's actually a church right now
[13:46] and brother reeks
[13:48] church there a little small assembly
[13:49] smaller quite smaller than ours
[13:52] that are facing it right now the brother
[13:54] brother eric and his wife both are sick
[13:56] with it
[13:56] there's others in their church that are
[13:58] sick with it and he said you know
[14:00] i thought i was trying to do whatever i
[14:02] could do and he said maybe i didn't do
[14:03] enough you know and they're facing this
[14:05] right now
[14:06] and we don't want to get there you know
[14:08] we don't want that to happen it may
[14:09] happen but we want to do everything we
[14:11] can
[14:11] to keep it from happening and so don't
[14:14] forget if you're dismissed go
[14:16] completely to your cars head to the
[14:18] house god bless you
[14:20] amen and well you can if you want to
[14:22] have a family get together whatever at
[14:23] your house that's up to you but
[14:25] we have to abide by things here at the
[14:27] church they're actually opening up
[14:28] another
[14:29] floor there in minden for covid because
[14:31] there's been an uptick in it
[14:33] so you know we just want to be mindful
[14:35] of these we we
[14:36] we trust the lord but we also got to do
[14:38] what we got to do
[14:40] and so let's do that with all of our
[14:42] heart and and keep our focus
[14:44] on what's really important when we walk
[14:46] through those doors it's not our seat
[14:48] it's not who we're sitting by it's not
[14:50] none of that it's all about
[14:52] him and i believe if we got that focus
[14:54] correct
[14:55] then everything else something good's
[14:57] about to happen
[14:58] amen but you know when that little
[15:00] thing's there and it causes a little
[15:01] nervousness or a little upset
[15:03] spirits those things are real too and
[15:06] they affect they affect people around
[15:08] you they're
[15:08] we want to push all that stuff out and
[15:10] say when i come to the house of the lord
[15:12] i'm coming for one reason
[15:14] that's to worship god and get our focus
[15:17] on that and let
[15:18] everything else go i mean whatever's
[15:20] going on in the world whatever is going
[15:21] on around us
[15:22] just let it go but stay focused on
[15:24] what's really important amen god bless
[15:26] you we stand together again
[15:28] didn't know if you want to be standing
[15:29] while i spoke about those things but
[15:32] you know i think we ought to be sincere
[15:34] and serious about it and then just
[15:36] understand that this is beyond our
[15:38] control it
[15:39] you know if something happens we get an
[15:41] outbreak of it
[15:42] government steps in we don't want none
[15:44] of that so we want to do everything we
[15:46] can do and that's why we're doing what
[15:47] we're doing so god bless you today
[15:49] but let's do remember the reeks in their
[15:52] in your prayer brother eric and his wife
[15:54] also i think several others in their
[15:56] church there's only a church of around
[15:58] 50
[15:58] 60 people but they've got quite a few
[16:00] quite a few that's
[16:01] got this and having some issues with it
[16:04] and
[16:04] so we don't remember them in prayer also
[16:06] we have brother dan pruitt
[16:08] that fell from a ladder and hurt himself
[16:10] and so we want to remember him as he
[16:13] recovers from that and continue to
[16:16] remember of course brother ron
[16:18] spencer in your prayers and just hold
[16:20] him up before the lord we need to just

[28:32] god to be with us
[28:33] in life's journey and we can't make it
[28:37] alone
[28:38] we got to have his help amen i'm
[28:41] i'm thankful that you know i was able to
[28:43] raise my children
[28:45] in a good church with family and and a
[28:48] whole community of believers to help me
[28:50] raise my children
[28:52] to serve the lord and i think that's a
[28:54] good policy to do
[28:55] is to find a church home and
[28:58] and mother to lead the child the
[29:02] children
[29:02] you know mother is the fifth gospel you
[29:04] know that there's matthew mark luke and
[29:07] john and mother
[29:08] well mother is um she takes them about
[29:11] the first
[29:12] five or six seven eight years or more
[29:15] and
[29:16] and trains them and teaches them and you
[29:19] know the
[29:19] one of the greatest things that we can
[29:21] do in life is to teach them about the
[29:23] lord
[29:24] and to come to know jesus and so that
[29:27] they'll come to know him and
[29:29] christ be the lord of their lives and
[29:32] you know it starts with us it starts
[29:34] with parents and moms and dads and
[29:37] grandparents and all the supporting ones
[29:40] to surrender their lives to god and be
[29:42] dedicated to serve god
[29:44] and then and then we can have children
[29:47] that are raised in the admonition
[29:50] of the lord and that's so important so
[29:52] let's take this little one to the lord
[29:54] that his
[29:55] parents have brought today as they did
[29:58] in the days of jesus they brought little
[29:59] ones to be blessed
[30:01] and i'm not jesus but i'm one of his
[30:03] servants today
[30:05] and we just take this child into our
[30:06] hand little caleb
[30:08] father precious little child that we
[30:11] hold in our hands
[30:14] lord a bible name then lord no doubt
[30:17] as they thought of names and of course
[30:20] naming after daddy and
[30:21] then somebody had named daddy after some
[30:25] figure somewhere but it all comes back
[30:27] to the bible
[30:29] where that there was a great man of
[30:31] faith a man who stayed true in his
[30:34] generation and served you and lord we
[30:37] no names have meanings and we named them
[30:41] after characters
[30:42] that were characters of righteousness
[30:46] and truth
[30:47] and this has been name is now passed
[30:49] down to this little child
[30:52] from daddy on town and lord i just pray
[30:55] god
[30:56] that he'll be reflective of the real
[30:58] caleb in the bible
[31:00] one that knows you lord and serves you
[31:03] and and brings back
[31:04] evidence that the land is true that the
[31:07] resurrection is right
[31:09] and that the holy spirit does reign and
[31:12] live in lives and hearts
[31:14] i pray lord for this child and for its
[31:16] mom and dad that the lord as we
[31:19] dedicate the child and them to you we
[31:22] just ask lord you'll bless them and
[31:24] bless their home
[31:25] and may you be the center of their home
[31:28] so that they can properly
[31:29] lead this child in paths of
[31:32] righteousness
[31:33] i pray god that as they
[31:36] go about their lives that they'll look
[31:38] into
[31:39] the instruction manual of the bible and
[31:42] see how to guide their lives so they can
[31:45] guide this child
[31:46] in paths of righteousness for your
[31:48] name's sake
[31:50] now father i bless this child in your
[31:52] name
[31:53] i ask you bless him with health may the
[31:55] angel of god
[31:56] be with him and over his little life

[47:51] minister to us today

[50:55] verse 5
[50:56] as we discover more about the scripture
[50:59] today and look into the word of god
[51:02] we're going to be speaking on today the
[51:04] supernatural is
[51:06] the mind of christ amen
[51:13] philippians 2 and 5 let this mind be in
[51:16] you which
[51:16] also was or was also in christ jesus
[51:21] who being in the form of god thought it
[51:23] not robbery to be equal with god but
[51:25] made himself of no reputation
[51:27] and took upon him the form of a servant
[51:29] and was made in the likeness of men
[51:32] and being found in fashion as a man
[51:35] he humbled himself and became obedient
[51:37] unto death
[51:39] even the death of the cross god bless
[51:42] you you can have your seats
[51:46] as i said this morning we're going to be
[51:48] speaking on the
[51:49] is the mind of christ and we have been
[51:53] speaking along the lines of faith and
[51:55] believing god
[51:56] and trust in him because we know that
[51:59] we are a people in this age and this
[52:01] time that is required to have a perfect
[52:04] faith that faith must reach his
[52:07] perfection
[52:08] in a people i think faith has never been
[52:11] given a square deal by the church
[52:15] yet it has given birth to all of men's
[52:17] greatest
[52:18] achievements you have men like sam
[52:21] walton who had
[52:22] faith in the power of bulk purchases
[52:26] and it made him millions and in stores
[52:29] in every county
[52:31] across america and then even in
[52:34] in across the world you had a man by the
[52:37] name of henry ford who
[52:39] had faith in a low-priced automobile and
[52:42] that every man could afford and um
[52:46] you see this this faith is what
[52:49] drove him to achieve
[52:53] and faith is the greatest element in
[52:56] advanced civilization is
[52:57] as humans we've um it is faith that
[53:01] gives
[53:01] birth to such achievements in the
[53:04] natural realm
[53:06] so the believer's faith in the father
[53:09] and his word
[53:10] it also gives birth to spiritual
[53:13] achievements and brother branham taught
[53:17] us that faith is like
[53:18] hyssop it's everywhere you know it was
[53:21] like a common weed that they were told
[53:24] to
[53:24] apply the blood with and it grew up in
[53:27] every crack everywhere
[53:28] you look actually there is faith there
[53:30] is common faith there's mental faith
[53:32] there's spiritual faith there's all
[53:34] types of faith
[53:35] and faith we know then comes by hearing
[53:39] and hearing the word of god so it's
[53:41] really important
[53:42] to hear god's word and to feed upon it
[53:45] and if the holy ghost is in you we know
[53:48] then
[53:48] the word is in you and the power is in
[53:50] you and god's own ability is in you
[53:53] i'm going to share this little quotation
[53:55] from the sermon perseverance
[53:58] he said i believe that virtue is in
[54:00] christ and christ is the word in the
[54:02] beginning was the word
[54:03] and the word was with god and the word
[54:07] was god and the word was made flesh and
[54:10] dwelt among us
[54:11] now the word itself comes back in the
[54:14] form
[54:14] of the holy spirit into us and it's the
[54:17] word in you
[54:18] god in you so many wants to point god
[54:22] to some mythical something way out away
[54:26] or so far away they overreach it god is
[54:29] in you
[54:30] the hope of glory christ the mind of
[54:33] christ
[54:34] in you you're reaching plum away from it
[54:38] trying to get what has been given to you
[54:41] god in the human being so we know then
[54:44] every one of us then have been given
[54:47] a measure of faith faith is something
[54:50] that can grow it can expand
[54:53] it can it can reach higher levels where
[54:56] that you
[54:56] can reach things and do things that you
[54:58] couldn't do without it
[55:01] um brother branham said in in greater
[55:04] than
[55:05] solomon he said if i could get this
[55:06] audience with one accord
[55:09] to see and know exactly that jesus
[55:12] christ
[55:13] is alive and here among you or he said
[55:16] oh you physically or mentally believe it
[55:19] but when it can go beyond the mind
[55:22] till you know it then something will
[55:24] happen when you can realize and the only
[55:27] thing is to see
[55:28] christ in our presence
[55:32] now sometimes we're gonna and somewhere
[55:35] and somehow
[55:36] we're gonna have to get our heads on on
[55:38] straight
[55:40] as satan's desire is to make this bride
[55:42] a weak
[55:43] and a powerless and a faithless people
[55:47] and let me just say some things very um
[55:51] very direct this morning because satan
[55:53] has
[55:54] he has all but stripped the power out of
[55:56] the entire
[55:57] message movement by shifting the
[56:00] emphasis
[56:01] from the supernatural power of god with
[56:04] signs and wonders to
[56:05] head knowledge of the word and this
[56:08] gives preachers and their congregants
[56:11] a sense of superior spirituality by
[56:15] having
[56:16] head knowledge of the message just an
[56:19] intellectual conception and their heads
[56:22] are in the clouds up there
[56:23] somewhere with all this superior
[56:25] knowledge and they don't
[56:27] know a thing about the supernatural
[56:29] experience
[56:30] with a supernatural god
[56:34] now head knowledge and intellectual
[56:37] conceptions is
[56:38] not the mind of christ the supernatural
[56:42] is the mind of christ but we have the
[56:45] word and
[56:46] the insinuation is then that healing
[56:50] and miracles and signs and wonders and
[56:52] gifts of the spirit and
[56:54] leadership of the holy ghost is is not
[56:57] needed and i just want to say so said
[57:00] the backslidden church down through the
[57:02] ages
[57:04] and you you cannot have the true word
[57:08] without the supernatural amen it is
[57:11] impossible
[57:13] amen and i want you to say we are not
[57:16] sign seekers and we are not to be
[57:20] sign seekers we are seekers however
[57:23] we seek his life how many this morning
[57:27] would say
[57:28] i'm a seeker and i'm seeking his life
[57:31] because with his life comes everything
[57:34] else
[57:35] now there are sign secrets they want
[57:37] signs for their entertainment
[57:40] and we know that happened even in
[57:41] brother bratton's ministry people flop
[57:43] just to see and be entertained by
[57:46] um a blind eye coming open or a deaf
[57:49] hearing or
[57:50] or some miraculous to be done it was
[57:53] almost like
[57:54] a magic show you know they want signs to
[57:57] show there are there are others that
[57:59] want sign to show their greatness
[58:03] and and for attraction or or wealth or
[58:06] the popularity
[58:08] that it would bring this is why the god
[58:11] can't
[58:11] trust many people we we're spiritual
[58:15] gifts is because
[58:17] they take it and make up it's something
[58:18] that's not intended
[58:20] and and they're like um they're like
[58:23] simon the sorcerer who wanted to buy the
[58:26] gift
[58:26] or the secret to laying on their hands
[58:29] where the people were empowered by the
[58:31] holy ghost and
[58:33] but but i wanted to say you know the
[58:35] bride of christ is not a gold digger
[58:39] she reunites to him because of his
[58:42] love amen she wants his life
[58:46] his word his love his power
[58:50] and all that he is amen
[58:53] our reason for expecting the signs to
[58:55] follow them that believe
[58:57] is not for our ego or for our pride
[59:01] it's not to set us apart as a special
[59:04] people or
[59:04] a different people or somebody with
[59:07] mystic power
[59:09] yeah we have seen the gold digging in
[59:11] the and the gold diggers the
[59:13] the uh healing evangelists and we've
[59:15] seen the gold digging denominations with
[59:18] their wealth
[59:19] amen yes we have seen the gold digging
[59:22] preachers
[59:23] who strung along the congregation who
[59:26] was attracted to them for promises of
[59:28] gold
[59:29] and god's blessings and for prosperity
[59:33] but that's not who the bride is
[59:36] she loves him and wants to see his life
[59:40] and all that he is manifested
[59:43] through her amen it's not even for our
[59:46] vindication
[59:48] amen it is because jesus gave us that
[59:51] commission
[59:51] to heal the sick cast out devils freely
[59:55] give
[59:55] as we be freely received and and if
[59:58] we're not
[59:59] going if we're not doing it we are not
[1:00:02] his church
[1:00:03] amen signs will automatically
[1:00:07] follow true doctrine
[1:00:10] i don't know how we got it that if we
[1:00:12] got two doctrines we
[1:00:13] don't have signs amen but if we got
[1:00:17] true doctrines there's gonna be signs
[1:00:19] followed amen
[1:00:21] amen so well you know brother tim though
[1:00:23] the the uh
[1:00:24] susan movement we we had gifts and
[1:00:27] healings and miracles
[1:00:28] and yet all kinds of era of doctrine
[1:00:31] that's right
[1:00:32] but you can't have true doctrine
[1:00:35] without the supernatural amen
[1:00:38] without without gifts without healing
[1:00:40] without miracles
[1:00:42] it is impossible to have true doctrine
[1:00:45] and not have it are you with me
[1:00:48] well buddy though brother tim we we got
[1:00:50] something greater we got the seals the
[1:00:52] opening of the seals
[1:00:54] opened up the book and all of its
[1:00:56] promises
[1:00:57] it did not take away the promises
[1:01:02] it opens up the whole land with every
[1:01:04] divine promise there is
[1:01:06] come on well you know brother jim i tell
[1:01:10] you i've seen it where
[1:01:11] the holy spirit was moving and one side
[1:01:14] of the congregation was in eunice and
[1:01:16] saying
[1:01:17] open up your gates and and the king of
[1:01:19] glory should come in and the other side
[1:01:21] answers and said
[1:01:22] well who is this king of glory the lord
[1:01:25] mighty in bible
[1:01:26] but we had arab brother tim we didn't
[1:01:28] have the pure word well i just say
[1:01:30] why can't we have both
[1:01:34] amen why why can't we have both why
[1:01:36] can't we have the word and the spirit
[1:01:39] amen why do we have to forfeit one for
[1:01:42] the other
[1:01:43] amen and why do we have to favor
[1:01:47] one over the other
[1:01:50] come on amen we can have both
[1:01:53] we can have the word and the spirit
[1:01:56] we can have everything the bible said we
[1:01:59] can have
[1:01:59] come on and i want to just say then
[1:02:03] and also again why do we keep
[1:02:05] emphasizing the mockery of it
[1:02:09] the faults the rome
[1:02:14] brother bradham told us in the sermon
[1:02:16] christ he said you say
[1:02:17] i can't believe in divine healing i
[1:02:20] can't believe in
[1:02:21] the miraculous oh i've seen this and
[1:02:24] you know you can just go into what we've
[1:02:26] seen
[1:02:28] oh we got a lot of mockery
[1:02:32] but we got the real holy spirit too
[1:02:36] and that's right why is there so much
[1:02:38] mockery on that side
[1:02:39] why is there so much on that side where
[1:02:41] does the clubs lay
[1:02:43] in an apple orchard under the best tree
[1:02:47] that's right you've got to have a a
[1:02:49] counterfeit
[1:02:50] and then if there is no counterfeit then
[1:02:52] what then what you're looking
[1:02:54] at is a counterfeit but if there's a
[1:02:57] copy
[1:02:57] somebody is trying to make it like like
[1:03:00] it
[1:03:00] and that proves there's a real one just
[1:03:02] open up your mind
[1:03:04] one time and let and think a little
[1:03:06] while for yourself
[1:03:08] and don't take so many people's other
[1:03:10] other people's word for it take
[1:03:12] god's word for it and again i want to
[1:03:15] say
[1:03:15] why do we have to keep emphasizing the
[1:03:18] mockery
[1:03:20] it ain't like we got a problem that
[1:03:23] we're just so overrun with miracles and
[1:03:25] signs and wonders and whatever else and
[1:03:27] we got too many of them we need to cut
[1:03:29] back on it
[1:03:31] all right hello
[1:03:34] amen yeah there's a mockery of speaking
[1:03:37] in tongues
[1:03:38] and it has been emphasized until nobody
[1:03:41] wants to speak in
[1:03:43] amen you know we're we're beyond that
[1:03:46] brother tim well how did you get beyond
[1:03:48] the word
[1:03:49] that's what i want to know how do we get
[1:03:51] beyond the word this is the word
[1:03:54] amen even even the signs follow them
[1:03:57] that believe they so
[1:03:58] speak with new tongues is that right
[1:04:01] there's some mockery of false prophets
[1:04:03] or or healings has been emphasized until
[1:04:07] true prophecies and healings are not
[1:04:09] wanted
[1:04:11] amen and this has produced
[1:04:14] a culture of unbelief
[1:04:18] and a rejection of the full word
[1:04:22] where we're favoring you know some
[1:04:26] great intellectual knowledge over
[1:04:30] the supernatural realm
[1:04:33] oh and i can already hear them saying oh
[1:04:36] but
[1:04:36] you better be careful there's anointed
[1:04:38] ones at the end time and
[1:04:40] i just want to remind you yep we're one
[1:04:42] of them
[1:04:42] [Music]
[1:04:44] amen we sure are because there's a bride
[1:04:47] who is the anointed one for this day
[1:04:50] she is anointed to fulfill the old
[1:04:52] testament
[1:04:54] even as christ the groom fulfilled the
[1:04:56] old testament
[1:04:59] so there is an anointed one at the end
[1:05:01] time
[1:05:02] and the rain let me remind you was not
[1:05:05] sent for the tear
[1:05:07] the rain was sent for the wheat
[1:05:10] god poured out the holy spirit not for
[1:05:13] the tear out here
[1:05:14] god poured out the holy spirit to bring
[1:05:16] a wheat into maturity
[1:05:22] so you want to say you want to hold
[1:05:24] behind us in a flag and say don't you
[1:05:26] know
[1:05:26] tears are over here shouting and
[1:05:29] rejoicing because of the rain
[1:05:31] well the only reason they got rain is
[1:05:33] because rain has been poured out on the
[1:05:34] week
[1:05:39] [Music]
[1:05:42] so why just point out the anointed false
[1:05:44] ones
[1:05:46] why don't we have to why don't we come
[1:05:48] to the realization the truth must be
[1:05:50] anointed
[1:05:52] wouldn't you but brother jim would you
[1:05:54] rather have love
[1:05:56] than miracles and signs and wonders
[1:05:58] because
[1:05:59] miracles and signs and wonders can be
[1:06:02] impersonated well so can love
[1:06:06] did we forget that you know
[1:06:10] so can all the fruits of the spirit
[1:06:14] well but but you know brother brother
[1:06:16] tim you it'll just see the
[1:06:18] very elect if it were possible with all
[1:06:20] of these signs and line signs and
[1:06:22] wonders
[1:06:23] and all of that and so we don't want to
[1:06:25] have anything to do with this well you
[1:06:26] better not have love joy peace long
[1:06:28] suffering gentleness meekness
[1:06:33] is that right because brother branham
[1:06:35] used the kind of priests and showed that
[1:06:37] he had
[1:06:37] more of that than jesus did
[1:06:40] impersonation it's an age of
[1:06:42] impersonation
[1:06:44] but that doesn't mean that the real
[1:06:46] can't be manifested
[1:06:49] amen so again again fruits of the
[1:06:52] spirits can be impersonated
[1:06:54] as much as emotions are miracles
[1:06:58] so i asked for a little bit of the same
[1:07:00] same time you know given to
[1:07:02] preaching against the fruits it's
[1:07:04] preaching against miracles
[1:07:08] hello don't hang up on me
[1:07:12] that confused you i know i just say give
[1:07:15] equal time
[1:07:18] amen again you know again i want to just
[1:07:22] ask you why can't we have both yes
[1:07:26] i want to say we must have both we can't
[1:07:29] just be a fruitless people
[1:07:31] without the fruits of the holy spirit of
[1:07:33] love joy peace long suffering gentleness
[1:07:36] meekness patience and all of that again
[1:07:38] such there is no law we can't just have
[1:07:40] that
[1:07:41] and not have the other the working of
[1:07:43] the supernatural a supernatural god
[1:07:46] among us we gotta have the supernatural
[1:07:50] at the altar
[1:07:51] we gotta have the supernatural and the
[1:07:53] pew we gotta have the supernatural in
[1:07:56] the pulpit
[1:08:01] amen so why are we forced to make a
[1:08:04] choice
[1:08:06] why do we have to settle for something
[1:08:08] less than the full gospel
[1:08:11] how many would say today i want the full
[1:08:13] gospel
[1:08:15] i want everything god promised i'm not
[1:08:17] taking anything out of the book
[1:08:20] i want the whole lamb i'm not giving any
[1:08:22] of it up to the enemy
[1:08:24] he gave me the land and i want it all
[1:08:27] amen we want everything from the
[1:08:29] negative to jordan we want everything
[1:08:31] and every promise we want
[1:08:33] we want every every promise that god
[1:08:35] made
[1:08:36] we want it to be ours we're not going to
[1:08:38] let the devil come along and
[1:08:40] fence a portion off of it and say stay
[1:08:42] out of here
[1:08:45] it's our land now
[1:08:50] again i wanted to share with you brother
[1:08:53] you know the other side just for a
[1:08:54] moment
[1:08:55] in christ the mystery brother branham
[1:08:58] said if a man
[1:08:59] says he is born again
[1:09:02] and he tries to place these promises of
[1:09:04] christ in the last day
[1:09:06] to some other age making him christ
[1:09:09] yesterday but not today
[1:09:11] then that man or that person has been in
[1:09:14] a delusion
[1:09:15] by satan and if that man says he
[1:09:18] believes that and it doesn't manifest
[1:09:20] through him
[1:09:22] jesus said in mark 16 these signs shall
[1:09:25] follow them that believe into all the
[1:09:28] world into every age casting out devils
[1:09:30] speaking with tongues
[1:09:32] and all these great manifestations of
[1:09:34] gifts that would follow
[1:09:35] that they shall not they may be
[1:09:39] they ought to they will and heavens and
[1:09:41] earth will pass away
[1:09:43] but his word won't
[1:09:46] amen again
[1:09:49] just uh another one here from the easter
[1:09:52] seal and
[1:09:52] i could have read i could raise to stand
[1:09:55] here the whole service
[1:09:56] and and just read one after another but
[1:09:59] we're just going to take a couple here
[1:10:01] and because i'm going to show you where
[1:10:03] brother branham stood on this
[1:10:05] in the easter seal he said i was
[1:10:07] listening to a radio program
[1:10:10] on k-a-r-r down in tucson
[1:10:13] his minister taking his side against us
[1:10:16] that the pentecostal religion was
[1:10:18] nothing but just a sham
[1:10:20] not to listen to it it was unstable said
[1:10:23] anyone that spoke
[1:10:24] any man that spoke in tongues and these
[1:10:27] things and claimed to be
[1:10:28] healed the sick and so forth by prayer
[1:10:31] that there was to leave away from and to
[1:10:32] pray for those poor decrepit people
[1:10:35] because they were all in an illusion
[1:10:38] that there was something wrong with him
[1:10:40] and he said oh how i would like to talk
[1:10:43] to that brother just a while
[1:10:45] and he said that that was only given for
[1:10:47] the apostles
[1:10:49] at the day of pentecost and that was
[1:10:52] that was all and i find he said 30 years
[1:10:55] later
[1:10:56] paul was ordaining these gifts in the
[1:10:59] church
[1:10:59] in first corinthians 15 he set the
[1:11:02] church
[1:11:03] in the church the gift of speaking in
[1:11:05] tongues miracles
[1:11:06] and all these other gifts was set in the
[1:11:08] church
[1:11:09] and jesus said go into all the world and
[1:11:11] preach the gospel
[1:11:12] to every creature how far all the world
[1:11:16] who too every creature and they have
[1:11:19] never received it yet
[1:11:22] amen and these signs shall follow them
[1:11:25] that believe how long all the world
[1:11:27] who too every creature amen
[1:11:30] these signs shall follow them in my name
[1:11:32] they shall
[1:11:33] cast out devils speak with new tongues
[1:11:35] if they taken up deadly things or
[1:11:37] serpents or
[1:11:38] drink a deadly thing it would not harm
[1:11:40] them they'll lay hands on the sick
[1:11:42] and they shall recover that was the last
[1:11:44] commission to the church
[1:11:46] mark 16 chapter and paul is ordaining
[1:11:49] these gifts into the church
[1:11:51] 30 years later and galatians 1 8 said if
[1:11:54] an angel
[1:11:55] from heaven preaches to you any other
[1:11:58] gospel
[1:11:58] than this which is already received see
[1:12:01] already been preached
[1:12:02] let it be let him be accursed and i
[1:12:05] believe that pentecost began
[1:12:07] without ending i believe it's to be to
[1:12:10] every creature
[1:12:12] all times to all places that pentecost
[1:12:15] should always remain
[1:12:17] the pentecostal blessings should be upon
[1:12:21] the people amen
[1:12:24] now so this is really really important
[1:12:29] because the mind of christ is the
[1:12:31] supernatural it's not an intellectual
[1:12:33] conception
[1:12:35] again see the discrepancy and i've
[1:12:38] always
[1:12:39] i've always loved this quotation when a
[1:12:41] man stands and says he's a gospel
[1:12:43] preacher
[1:12:44] and he says the days of miracles has
[1:12:46] passed that's the seed of discrepancy
[1:12:50] when a man stands and said he's a
[1:12:52] minister a pastor of a church or
[1:12:54] somewhere
[1:12:55] that and he does not believe that jesus
[1:12:58] christ is the same
[1:13:00] in every detail except the physical body
[1:13:04] same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:06] that seed of discrepancy when he says
[1:13:09] that miracles in apostolic ages passed
[1:13:12] that seed of discrepancy and when they
[1:13:15] say there's no such thing as divine
[1:13:17] healing
[1:13:18] that seeded discrepancy and the world is
[1:13:21] full of it and it crowds out
[1:13:23] and it chokes out the wheat
[1:13:26] amen i've got some more things to share
[1:13:28] on that choking here in just a moment
[1:13:31] but i want you to understand these
[1:13:32] things that are being said
[1:13:34] it chokes out the wheat
[1:13:38] now we must fulfill
[1:13:42] the great commission jesus could not
[1:13:45] tell us to preach the gospel and all the
[1:13:47] world
[1:13:48] and now we've had seven church ages
[1:13:51] and we only come back to the last age
[1:13:53] where the true gospel is restored again
[1:13:56] how many understands that amen we are in
[1:13:59] a day
[1:14:00] of restoration luther didn't have it
[1:14:02] wesley didn't have it
[1:14:03] down to the ages they they left the true
[1:14:06] gospel
[1:14:07] they left the correct baptism the
[1:14:10] correct godhead
[1:14:11] the original sin predestination the
[1:14:14] security of the believer
[1:14:16] more and more and more we can just go
[1:14:17] down the line of what they left
[1:14:20] is that right but we're an hour of
[1:14:22] restoration
[1:14:25] amen and so god would have to restore
[1:14:28] the original gospel back again
[1:14:32] the original word that fell on the day
[1:14:34] of pentecost
[1:14:36] the gospel of jesus christ now this is
[1:14:39] important because jesus said this gospel
[1:14:41] must be preached into all the world
[1:14:43] and then the end can come how many wants
[1:14:46] the end to come
[1:14:48] then the gospel must be preached what
[1:14:51] this gospel not method is baptist
[1:14:54] pentecostal
[1:14:55] catholic is this gospel the original
[1:14:58] gospel the word
[1:15:00] in power must be preached into all the
[1:15:03] world
[1:15:03] so the end can come amen brother branham
[1:15:07] was clear he said preaching is not
[1:15:09] teaching he
[1:15:10] said it is demonstrating the gospel
[1:15:13] and the gospel must be preached
[1:15:16] demonstrated
[1:15:19] in the sermon christ brother branham
[1:15:21] said you're not using your own thoughts
[1:15:23] you're using his thoughts
[1:15:25] let the mind that was in christ being
[1:15:27] you see
[1:15:28] they think his way of thinking
[1:15:33] say what he says confession means to say
[1:15:37] the
[1:15:38] same thing confess us to confess
[1:15:41] the same thing say the same thing that
[1:15:43] don't confess your own mental conception
[1:15:46] be born again and confess his word
[1:15:50] amen confess what he said that's
[1:15:53] confession by his stripes that was
[1:15:54] healed
[1:15:56] say by stripes i have a right by his
[1:15:59] wounds right now
[1:16:00] i have a right for salvation
[1:16:03] amen i have a right for the holy spirit
[1:16:06] he promised it to me he said it's for
[1:16:08] you
[1:16:09] and your children and them that is afar
[1:16:11] off and as many as the lord our god
[1:16:14] shall
[1:16:14] call i believe it he said it's
[1:16:17] it's for any generation lo i'm with you
[1:16:21] always even to the end of the world he
[1:16:23] died
[1:16:23] that he might riot raise again and be
[1:16:26] with his church all the way to the end
[1:16:28] of the world
[1:16:28] to confirm the word with signs following
[1:16:31] how far was it to be
[1:16:32] go ye didn't end it with the apostles
[1:16:35] mark 16 go ye
[1:16:36] to all the world preach the gospel to
[1:16:37] every creature it's never
[1:16:39] met there yet just about a third of it
[1:16:42] god is depending on us
[1:16:45] so it's on our shoulders amen to preach
[1:16:49] the full gospel
[1:16:52] and to demonstrate what is written in
[1:16:54] the word
[1:16:55] to manifest what has been promised
[1:16:59] amen now you know brother branham said
[1:17:03] some very shocking things in shreveport
[1:17:05] louisiana when he was there at jack
[1:17:07] morris tabernacle
[1:17:09] because he just flat out told them he
[1:17:11] said we know the modern church
[1:17:14] in his present condition and present
[1:17:16] state is in no condition
[1:17:18] to finish up the great commission
[1:17:21] that god gave the church for this day
[1:17:23] and he said how many pentecostals can
[1:17:25] say amen to that i'm pretty sure they
[1:17:26] were mom
[1:17:29] now he said the pentagon we know the
[1:17:31] church could not the pentecostal church
[1:17:33] by no means by no means
[1:17:36] could carry out the last day message in
[1:17:39] his present
[1:17:40] condition could it
[1:17:43] why it can't even agree on one or two
[1:17:45] words in the bible
[1:17:47] well how you going to get it to going to
[1:17:50] do it it can't do it so you see
[1:17:51] denomination is out it's going to be an
[1:17:54] elected people
[1:17:56] that is elected for it and i want to say
[1:17:59] i believe we are that elected people
[1:18:02] amen he said we know the church and that
[1:18:05] condition could not finish up
[1:18:07] the last day how could it bring in
[1:18:09] malachi 4. amen and you've got to have
[1:18:13] malachi 4 you've got to have a prophet
[1:18:15] to whom the word the lord comes to in
[1:18:17] order to turn the hearts of the children
[1:18:19] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:18:21] to bring the restoration that is needed
[1:18:24] amen so he said how could he believe and
[1:18:27] bring in
[1:18:27] saint luke 17 30. about how could it
[1:18:31] bring in all these other scriptures
[1:18:33] that's promised the last day
[1:18:34] it couldn't do it because it denies it
[1:18:38] as it was in the days a lot so shall
[1:18:40] they be in the coming of the son of man
[1:18:43] finish up the great commission he says
[1:18:45] how could they do it
[1:18:46] we know they're dead god let it die
[1:18:50] in this scientific age
[1:18:53] after also what so he could do what open
[1:18:56] up the seven seal mystery
[1:18:58] to the undenominational bride
[1:19:01] when it's absolutely contrary to
[1:19:04] denominational thinking
[1:19:05] serpent seed all these other things the
[1:19:08] whole seven
[1:19:09] mysteries is contrary to what they've
[1:19:11] been taught because they took it
[1:19:13] took the old school from their bible
[1:19:14] school but you know we didn't get it
[1:19:17] from a bible school
[1:19:19] but about that time
[1:19:22] amen when i was about to make a horrible
[1:19:24] mistake
[1:19:25] when i was going to go back to the old
[1:19:27] schools and the books
[1:19:29] and the things and say what they said
[1:19:30] about that time
[1:19:32] he came in the room and he changed my
[1:19:35] thinking
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:38] amen now god opened the seven seals to
[1:19:42] reveal the mysteries of the book
[1:19:44] so that we could go forth with a full
[1:19:47] gospel
[1:19:48] to finish the great commission i want
[1:19:51] you to keep that in mind
[1:19:52] we are the finished
[1:19:55] race there's none coming after us
[1:19:59] we are the last generation well look
[1:20:03] look you can see
[1:20:04] diseases are coming in they don't know
[1:20:06] what to do with
[1:20:08] shutting down the world shutting down
[1:20:09] their economies
[1:20:11] riots that are taking place that they
[1:20:13] don't even have
[1:20:15] they don't even have the backbone to
[1:20:17] stop
[1:20:20] there's no cheats in the law there's no
[1:20:22] there's no there
[1:20:23] and and it isn't even the law it's the
[1:20:26] moral
[1:20:26] fiber of the country has gone down
[1:20:30] and the united states as well as the
[1:20:33] world has been invaded by
[1:20:34] demons and homes are not
[1:20:37] set on the bible anymore
[1:20:39] [Applause]
[1:20:41] i remember they're set on the popular
[1:20:43] thinking of the world
[1:20:44] and satan has given his mind the mind of
[1:20:48] the beast
[1:20:51] to the world we're living in
[1:20:56] you've never seen it where in just a
[1:20:58] generation we have
[1:20:59] changed the whole thinking of people
[1:21:03] the whole morals of people and we did it
[1:21:06] with television
[1:21:08] and songs and movies
[1:21:15] we put in a homosexual agenda
[1:21:18] in our movies we too we took and made
[1:21:22] mockeries out of dads
[1:21:26] come on amen we took and made we took
[1:21:29] and made mockery
[1:21:30] out of a homemaker with with uh
[1:21:33] we love lucy am i made her look like a
[1:21:38] stupid idiot
[1:21:40] come on we started with systematically
[1:21:43] destroying the fiber of the family and
[1:21:46] the morals of the home
[1:21:47] and the church has not stood against it
[1:21:52] and worldliness is coming to the church
[1:21:56] and it's allowed the mind and the
[1:21:57] thinking of satan to take preeminence
[1:22:00] over the word of god
[1:22:02] and i'm just going to say it sermons
[1:22:04] like god of this evil age and satan's
[1:22:06] seed
[1:22:06] and some of the you know the flats and
[1:22:08] red lights of the simon is coming
[1:22:10] they wouldn't be welcome
[1:22:14] in many places today many homes
[1:22:17] it's a foreign voice
[1:22:21] it's so archaic it's so out of step
[1:22:24] it's so oh god help me to stay out of
[1:22:28] step
[1:22:30] with the world
[1:22:33] help me lord to walk with you help me
[1:22:36] lord not to take on their mind
[1:22:38] help me lord to keep the right mind
[1:22:42] amen but it's coming in it comes into
[1:22:44] home it comes into our thinking
[1:22:47] listen to you you you sometimes we
[1:22:50] we are asleep as to what is going on in
[1:22:53] our nation and our world but
[1:22:55] you know we we've set our colleges and
[1:22:57] our schools
[1:22:58] full of curriculums and and teachers
[1:23:02] who are teaching a liberal agenda
[1:23:07] who are destroying and undermining the
[1:23:09] very fibers
[1:23:10] of the home
[1:23:14] amen and they're set they're full to
[1:23:16] their poison
[1:23:18] a whole generation of people and they've
[1:23:21] changed the minds of people to a godless
[1:23:24] society
[1:23:26] and if you're not careful it'll do the
[1:23:27] same thing in your life
[1:23:31] and it takes the woman and takes her out
[1:23:33] of her place in the home and as a mother
[1:23:35] and the value of motherhood and puts her
[1:23:38] there where she is nothing and
[1:23:39] nobody unless she's a career girl
[1:23:43] and now the woman even in message homes
[1:23:45] has more authority and more
[1:23:47] more dominion than than the than the man
[1:23:50] who the bible said is the head of the
[1:23:52] house
[1:23:52] [Applause]
[1:23:55] amen then our dress and our styles and
[1:23:59] everything else goes
[1:24:00] to be patterned with what's acceptable
[1:24:02] out there and what looks chick and cool
[1:24:05] and hot
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:08] amount is the truth this is where we are
[1:24:12] in this day amen it's aware that it's on
[1:24:15] sex and
[1:24:16] violence and people are being fed a
[1:24:18] whole belly full of it
[1:24:20] because and they are they are they are
[1:24:22] taking the seal and digesting
[1:24:24] and it comes in their mind and it
[1:24:26] permeates their and controls their
[1:24:28] thinking
[1:24:30] but i want you to know there's a
[1:24:32] supernatural coming down
[1:24:34] there is a real holy ghost that'll give
[1:24:37] you a saying thinking
[1:24:38] in an insane world
[1:24:46] we need the supernatural more than we've
[1:24:48] ever needed it
[1:24:50] we need to know a supernatural god a
[1:24:53] supernatural power
[1:24:55] that'll change our lives in a
[1:24:57] supernatural way
[1:24:58] [Applause]
[1:25:00] [Music]
[1:25:09] the five identifications are different
[1:25:11] definite identifications of the true
[1:25:13] church
[1:25:15] brother branham identified what a true
[1:25:17] church would be
[1:25:20] and he said and you that don't believe
[1:25:22] in divine healing your churches this is
[1:25:24] tape you understand i'm
[1:25:25] not only talking to you somebody else is
[1:25:27] going to hear it
[1:25:30] your churches claim that you believe in
[1:25:31] god and believe it
[1:25:33] in the commission that your church is
[1:25:35] commissioned to take the gospel
[1:25:38] and the very first thing is divine
[1:25:40] healing
[1:25:43] what was the very what was the first
[1:25:45] thing jesus told his disciples
[1:25:48] when he sent them out now but listen you
[1:25:50] you know you can look at me like i'm
[1:25:52] strange this morning but
[1:25:53] actually divine healing has been
[1:25:55] ostracized and put down
[1:25:58] we're in a day well we got medicines and
[1:26:00] we got doctors and we believe in them
[1:26:03] hey man we're not we're not coming down
[1:26:05] on doctors in medicine
[1:26:07] but i want to tell you something church
[1:26:08] god was before medicine
[1:26:12] and his healing was was before all of
[1:26:15] this laodicean age
[1:26:18] amen and we we're going to have to if we
[1:26:22] can't believe
[1:26:23] in divine healing how are we going to
[1:26:24] believe for rapture
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:28] amen amen as brother branham would say
[1:26:32] over and again if i can't get you to
[1:26:34] believe
[1:26:35] even for divine healing how am i going
[1:26:37] to get you to believe for
[1:26:38] the change of your body we won't believe
[1:26:42] that god can just heal part how could
[1:26:43] you believe god to heal
[1:26:45] the whole
[1:26:50] amen now
[1:26:56] what was the first thing jesus told his
[1:26:58] disciples when he sent them out
[1:27:01] heal the sick cast out devils what was
[1:27:04] the last thing he said to this church
[1:27:05] heal the sick cast out devils
[1:27:09] amen outfit omega benjamin and reuben
[1:27:12] first and last he that was which is and
[1:27:15] shall come the morning star the root
[1:27:16] offspring of david hallelujah that's him
[1:27:19] these signs shall follow them that
[1:27:20] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:27:22] devil just
[1:27:23] at jerusalem to all the world every
[1:27:26] creature is that the bible
[1:27:27] that's what it says that is the message
[1:27:30] of the church
[1:27:33] all the world every creature the gospel
[1:27:35] to everyone that believes
[1:27:37] these signs shall follow
[1:27:41] amen that's the message of the church in
[1:27:44] my name they shall cast out devil let me
[1:27:46] tell you something
[1:27:47] salvation is casting out devils
[1:27:50] nobody can get saved till the devil's
[1:27:52] cast out
[1:27:54] now you know the cast out may not be an
[1:27:56] exorcism
[1:27:57] in that way where we're screaming and
[1:27:59] yelling that will come out but it's the
[1:28:01] same thing you've got to
[1:28:02] you've got to dethrone the devil in your
[1:28:04] life
[1:28:05] amen all the cigarettes and the all the
[1:28:08] the
[1:28:09] dope and all the sin and the habits of
[1:28:11] the world have got to go
[1:28:14] amen it's you gotta die to that and
[1:28:16] that's gotta be cast out of your life
[1:28:18] and you have victory over it amen
[1:28:21] you're not gonna be the same old thing
[1:28:24] same as you was
[1:28:25] your life is gonna be different you'll
[1:28:27] tally up to the word
[1:28:30] now so that's the message of the church
[1:28:34] that's what he commanded the church to
[1:28:36] do to cast out devils they shall speak
[1:28:38] with new tongues
[1:28:40] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:28:43] drink a deadly thing it'll not harm them
[1:28:44] they'll lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:28:46] recover
[1:28:47] that's the commission of the church
[1:28:50] that is the real believing church
[1:28:54] is that taught in the methodists baptist
[1:28:56] presbyterian catholic
[1:28:58] lutheran nazarene pilgrim holiness no
[1:29:00] sir they deny it
[1:29:04] why they're organized and they can't do
[1:29:06] it there's many a member in there that
[1:29:08] believes that but he can't say anything
[1:29:10] about it because he'll be excommunicated
[1:29:13] that's the antichrist spirit that's got
[1:29:14] to organize
[1:29:16] you see it bound them down it chokes it
[1:29:18] out
[1:29:20] the church of the living god is free
[1:29:22] born of the spirit
[1:29:23] it don't need any denomination they fi
[1:29:25] that follow the king
[1:29:27] of the messianic kingdom they don't have
[1:29:30] to
[1:29:30] they don't have to take the people's
[1:29:32] things they're free born they're made
[1:29:34] free by the son
[1:29:35] who makes them free indeed these signs
[1:29:37] shall follow them
[1:29:38] now it goes on and he says now another
[1:29:42] thing the church
[1:29:43] will teach will be divine healing he's
[1:29:46] emphasizing
[1:29:47] the message of the church
[1:29:51] wait a minute brother tim the divine
[1:29:54] healing
[1:29:55] it's a minor it's the message
[1:29:59] of the church now it's only a minor when
[1:30:03] compared to
[1:30:05] which is healing of the soul healing of
[1:30:08] the body comes secondary
[1:30:10] but it's not a minor when it comes to
[1:30:12] the bible
[1:30:13] and jesus ministry or the prophet's
[1:30:16] ministry
[1:30:17] or the bride's ministry
[1:30:21] but we have de-emphasized it we don't
[1:30:23] need it
[1:30:26] you know i mean i've personally been in
[1:30:28] a place where
[1:30:29] where the you know they they i preached
[1:30:32] and this well we're going to have a
[1:30:33] prayer
[1:30:34] line because some of you you know you
[1:30:36] can't have faith enough to receive it
[1:30:38] out there so we'll get up here and let
[1:30:39] you
[1:30:40] hands laid on you so he you know goes on
[1:30:43] for about
[1:30:43] 15 minutes of why why you're faithless
[1:30:46] if you come in a prayer line
[1:30:48] and finally they call the prayer line i
[1:30:50] was surprised anybody came after that
[1:30:52] but they did and then when i
[1:30:56] you were there and and then when when we
[1:30:59] went to pray for the sick you know
[1:31:01] you know oh no just lay hands on them
[1:31:02] you know no no no excitement no
[1:31:05] no no earnest prayers like they just lay
[1:31:07] hands on them pass them by pass them by
[1:31:09] and the guy stood right there and then
[1:31:11] just shoved them right through just like
[1:31:13] cattle going through an auction
[1:31:18] that was in a message church
[1:31:22] now but this
[1:31:26] church will teach
[1:31:29] divine healing the message of the church
[1:31:34] i just quoted he said matthew 10 1
[1:31:38] and when he had called unto him his 12
[1:31:40] disciples
[1:31:41] he gave them power against unclean
[1:31:43] spirits to cast them out
[1:31:45] and to heal all manner of sickness and
[1:31:47] all manner of diseases
[1:31:50] a church who is not casting out devils
[1:31:53] is not a god called church
[1:31:59] amen the first that was his first
[1:32:02] commission to the church the last
[1:32:04] commission was
[1:32:06] go into all the world preach the gospel
[1:32:09] to every nation and demonstrate the
[1:32:12] power
[1:32:12] of the holy ghost he that believeth on
[1:32:14] this is baptized shall be saved
[1:32:16] he that denies it will be damned these
[1:32:18] signs will follow them that believe they
[1:32:20] will lay hands on the sick
[1:32:21] they shall recover they will cast out
[1:32:24] devils they'll speak with new tongues
[1:32:25] and this will be the signs that will
[1:32:27] follow
[1:32:27] and the last verse says and they
[1:32:29] returned and the lord
[1:32:31] working with them confirming the word
[1:32:33] with signs following
[1:32:34] that's the way the first church was
[1:32:39] and jesus said i'm the mind you're the
[1:32:41] branches and if a branch brings forth a
[1:32:43] vine
[1:32:44] then that vine and that vine that bears
[1:32:46] grapes then the next branch comes forth
[1:32:48] it'll bear
[1:32:49] just like the first branch did he said
[1:32:52] but brother branham
[1:32:54] when we look at all of these churches he
[1:32:56] says those are grafted mines
[1:33:01] you can grab citrus fruit you can make
[1:33:02] an orange treat and put a lemon on it
[1:33:04] and it'll grow
[1:33:06] that's what man grafted in and these
[1:33:09] organizations what man grafted in it's a
[1:33:11] lemon all the time
[1:33:13] it'll grow because it's stuck out in the
[1:33:15] church's name
[1:33:16] but let me tell you if that tree
[1:33:19] ever puts forth another branch it'll
[1:33:22] bear an
[1:33:23] orange and if the power of god ever puts
[1:33:25] forth another church
[1:33:27] it'll be another pentecost and another
[1:33:30] book of acts will be wrote behind it
[1:33:32] because it is the church of
[1:33:35] hallelujah amen how many believes that
[1:33:38] we're in the day where
[1:33:39] of the tree amen the vine christ
[1:33:43] has put forth another branch
[1:33:46] hallelujah then she's gonna be a fruit
[1:33:48] baron branch
[1:33:51] amen shall write another book of acts
[1:33:53] behind it
[1:33:54] not the acts of wicked men but the acts
[1:33:58] of the holy ghost
[1:34:02] that's why brother branham said we're
[1:34:03] trying to get the church this is perfect
[1:34:05] faith trying to get the church
[1:34:07] i wonder if we could just try to get the
[1:34:09] church into a place
[1:34:11] where we can really see apostolic times
[1:34:13] moving among us
[1:34:15] that's what we all hunger and it's just
[1:34:18] laying right at
[1:34:19] the door see we why we see it but we
[1:34:23] want to see
[1:34:23] more of it we want it to flow such a
[1:34:26] flow that will be a help to us
[1:34:29] and us flow out to others
[1:34:33] amen so these apostolic times are
[1:34:37] not to repeat of the turmoil and strife
[1:34:40] found in the book of acts
[1:34:42] those were the acts of carnal men the
[1:34:46] the apostolic times that are promised
[1:34:48] are the result
[1:34:49] of the original vine putting forth
[1:34:52] another branch from himself
[1:34:54] and the holy spirit acting in the
[1:34:56] believer as he did back then
[1:35:03] of course we can look in the book of
[1:35:05] acts and we can see carnality
[1:35:08] we can see divisions we can see strife
[1:35:12] and way but let me tell you that's not
[1:35:14] what was promised to be restored
[1:35:18] it's the acts of the holy spirit that's
[1:35:20] what's promised to be restored
[1:35:23] somebody with me amen so again and does
[1:35:26] god change his mind
[1:35:28] he says we're missing the power we ought
[1:35:31] to have
[1:35:33] where the big machine ought to be up
[1:35:35] running and great signs and wonders well
[1:35:37] this building ought to be setting so
[1:35:39] full of the power of god now to
[1:35:41] a sinner couldn't stay in here
[1:35:44] the holy spirit condemned it right
[1:35:46] quickly like ananias and fire
[1:35:49] and he said we're missing something
[1:35:54] amen in the message communion the last
[1:35:57] sermon brother branham would preach
[1:36:00] he said you know the hour will soon
[1:36:01] arise when right among us will be the
[1:36:03] holy spirit will speak out
[1:36:05] like it did with an anonymous fire
[1:36:08] remember
[1:36:08] the hour is arriving and you now you
[1:36:12] just remember that
[1:36:13] see god is going to dwell among
[1:36:17] his people that's what he wants to do
[1:36:20] now
[1:36:22] amen and we need to become that kind of
[1:36:25] a church
[1:36:27] amen i'm not so much i'm i'm not so much
[1:36:30] interested
[1:36:30] in interested in striking people dead i
[1:36:33] want to see sin struck dead
[1:36:36] i believe struck dead i want to see life
[1:36:39] working in the body
[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:43] amen amen
[1:36:49] instead of tearing for the baptism of
[1:36:50] the holy ghost this is god of this evil
[1:36:52] age
[1:36:53] again one of his last sermons instead of
[1:36:56] tarin for the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:58] let signs prove to her the holy ghost
[1:37:00] was only for the disciples
[1:37:03] instead of keeping the vine healing
[1:37:04] going when she ought to be now raised in
[1:37:06] the dead and doing great miracles
[1:37:08] she has let satan under his leadership a
[1:37:10] religious man
[1:37:11] take the word of god and try to say it
[1:37:13] was for another age and she's believed
[1:37:15] it
[1:37:18] amen
[1:37:20] jesus said i'm the vine and you are the
[1:37:23] branches
[1:37:26] and it's not the vine that bears fruit
[1:37:28] it's the branches
[1:37:30] that are to bear fruit but
[1:37:33] i want you to look at the fruit
[1:37:36] we're seeing denominational fruit on the
[1:37:39] vine
[1:37:40] why is this you know
[1:37:43] again because every kind of other thing
[1:37:47] has been grafted into it
[1:37:49] we haven't kept the message pure
[1:37:52] amen but every kind of thing has been
[1:37:55] grafted in listen brother madam said
[1:37:57] you know again if the power of god ever
[1:38:00] puts forth another church
[1:38:01] it'll be another pentecost
[1:38:05] another book of acts will be wrote
[1:38:06] behind it
[1:38:08] because it's the church of god amen
[1:38:11] now so now
[1:38:15] we might ask how will we know it's god's
[1:38:18] mind
[1:38:20] how we know will we know it's god we'll
[1:38:22] know him by his nature
[1:38:24] amen we'll know him by his works
[1:38:28] amen no no we won't be a bunch of
[1:38:31] shouting emotional people
[1:38:32] and no life to go with it no it will not
[1:38:36] be a bunch of signs and wonders
[1:38:38] and and and no no forgiveness and no
[1:38:41] love and and no power of grace
[1:38:45] no it won't be this it'll be a full
[1:38:47] gospel
[1:38:49] not just a part are you with me amen if
[1:38:52] the church that come off of that vine
[1:38:54] was a pentecostal church
[1:38:56] with all the gifts if that ever really
[1:38:59] puts out another branch
[1:39:00] they'll write another book of acts
[1:39:02] behind it that's what they had in the
[1:39:04] days of the apostle
[1:39:05] and the apostolic age never ended
[1:39:12] now let's go from there
[1:39:16] let's talk about the mind for a moment
[1:39:19] there's a sermon that i think you ought
[1:39:22] to pour over
[1:39:23] just really pour over a couple of them
[1:39:25] actually
[1:39:26] one of them's word made flesh in india
[1:39:28] trip and the other is the fundamental
[1:39:29] foundation for
[1:39:30] faith and man it'd be good to
[1:39:33] to go over them and really study them
[1:39:37] so he says now if we could completely
[1:39:40] throw ourselves to god
[1:39:42] into his will and be
[1:39:45] lost to our own thoughts
[1:39:48] and let the mind of christ be in us
[1:39:52] then them same operations of the spirit
[1:39:55] would work through us
[1:39:57] just as natural things does
[1:40:00] because we were first created for that
[1:40:03] purpose to control to
[1:40:04] rule and to praise god and live for god
[1:40:08] amen you know the word dominion has
[1:40:11] almost
[1:40:12] been lost from the church god made you
[1:40:15] to have dominion
[1:40:18] that's what he was giving you he said
[1:40:19] these sign will follow them that believe
[1:40:21] i give you dominion over devils
[1:40:23] i give you dominion over unclean spirits
[1:40:26] i give you dominion over
[1:40:28] sickness diseases i'm giving you
[1:40:31] dominion
[1:40:35] now jesus said if you abide in me my
[1:40:38] words abide in you you can ask what you
[1:40:40] will it shall be done for you
[1:40:42] and if you abide in me and my words
[1:40:44] abide in you he said the father in his
[1:40:46] word is ex
[1:40:47] inseparable because the word is the son
[1:40:52] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:40:53] word was with god the word was god the
[1:40:55] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:40:58] god and his word is inseparable
[1:41:02] you cannot have god without having his
[1:41:04] word
[1:41:05] and when you have his word you have god
[1:41:09] amen now he said if you want to look a
[1:41:12] little further
[1:41:13] as far as back a little further as a
[1:41:16] historical you could see the word
[1:41:18] in the beginning was the word but what
[1:41:19] what what is the word a word is a
[1:41:21] thought manifested
[1:41:23] a thought spoken forth god
[1:41:27] first perceived the thought and he spoke
[1:41:29] it
[1:41:30] and it became a word and the word became
[1:41:32] material
[1:41:33] so everything that god has spoken his
[1:41:36] word
[1:41:37] received in the right channel will
[1:41:40] materialize that word for whatever
[1:41:42] promise
[1:41:42] that is behind it god will do it he's
[1:41:45] obligated to do it
[1:41:47] amen amen now then that's that's where
[1:41:50] we want to come
[1:41:51] this is what we were singing this song a
[1:41:53] moment ago we want him to have his way
[1:41:55] in our life we want to be the
[1:41:56] channel become a channel a cleaned out
[1:42:00] channel and remember we're not strapped
[1:42:03] up but where the word can flow through
[1:42:05] us
[1:42:06] where healing can flow and deliverance
[1:42:09] can flow
[1:42:11] listen you need peace to flow even in
[1:42:13] your own home
[1:42:15] in your own situation be able to change
[1:42:17] atmosphere
[1:42:20] you need salvation for your children
[1:42:24] and but we need it in the church
[1:42:29] becoming a channel the holy spirit can
[1:42:32] move through
[1:42:33] so he says and then if you abide in me
[1:42:37] my word abide in you then
[1:42:38] you have god the word in you and you
[1:42:41] believe
[1:42:42] in the word uh just as you believe god
[1:42:45] you believe the word just as you believe
[1:42:46] god because it is it is god and it's
[1:42:49] inseparable
[1:42:50] then if you have god's word in you you
[1:42:52] have god's life in you
[1:42:53] you have god in you and whatever god's
[1:42:55] word speaks forth out of you
[1:42:57] it'll have to come to pass just like it
[1:43:00] was spoke
[1:43:01] from god
[1:43:04] those are incredible words oh yeah
[1:43:07] so then we must get in the right channel
[1:43:12] we must get in the right channel god's
[1:43:14] ordained a bride
[1:43:15] to be in this position you are here for
[1:43:18] such a time as this
[1:43:22] when all the rest of the world is going
[1:43:24] insane
[1:43:25] and you can see the insanity coming upon
[1:43:28] the world
[1:43:29] amen it's all happening everywhere that
[1:43:31] you look
[1:43:32] that in that moment in that time there's
[1:43:34] got to be a bride with the mind of
[1:43:36] christ
[1:43:36] who knows what he wants done with his
[1:43:38] word
[1:43:41] now jesus said whatever you ask the
[1:43:44] father
[1:43:45] in my name that will i do did you ever
[1:43:48] realize what that means you realize if
[1:43:50] we go before
[1:43:51] god in the name of jesus it's just the
[1:43:54] same as jesus himself praying
[1:43:57] it isn't me praying anymore if i come in
[1:43:59] his name and he recognizes his name
[1:44:01] jesus said
[1:44:02] ask the father in my name that i will do
[1:44:04] and then i go to the father in jesus
[1:44:07] name
[1:44:07] it isn't me praying anymore it's jesus
[1:44:11] it's his spirit praying through me
[1:44:15] and then i've got to receive what i've
[1:44:16] asked for because he said it
[1:44:18] and it's god's own word and they can do
[1:44:21] nothing else but just produce what it
[1:44:23] said
[1:44:25] amen now man was originally
[1:44:29] made to walk in the mind of god
[1:44:32] he didn't use his own thinking about
[1:44:34] things
[1:44:35] he worked by the mind of god the realm
[1:44:39] of faith was real to him it was not
[1:44:43] an elusive darkened knowledge
[1:44:46] i'd like you to turn with me to
[1:44:48] ephesians 4 and 8
[1:44:49] because paul talks about us when we were
[1:44:51] sinners
[1:44:52] he said having the understanding
[1:44:55] darkened
[1:44:57] being alienated from the life of christ
[1:45:01] through the ignorance that is in them
[1:45:03] because of the blindness
[1:45:04] of their heart so you can see their
[1:45:08] understanding is darkened being
[1:45:11] alienated from the life of god to the
[1:45:14] ignorance that is in them
[1:45:16] because of the blindness of their heart
[1:45:18] that's the way we were born
[1:45:20] that's why that when you're born again
[1:45:22] it has to be of faith and faith gives
[1:45:24] you a vision
[1:45:25] the ability to see god's word and his
[1:45:27] promises
[1:45:28] amen now the bible speaks of this
[1:45:31] condition of the sinful uh
[1:45:34] mind as a corrupt mind
[1:45:39] a mind that is blinded by the god of
[1:45:41] this world
[1:45:42] but that's not the way it was with adam
[1:45:45] when it was in the hands of adam
[1:45:47] adam was a channel to whom the word
[1:45:50] could work through
[1:45:52] amen he never had to be sick
[1:45:55] he never had to die he never had to
[1:45:57] worry
[1:45:58] you know he never had a heartache he
[1:46:00] never had a fear
[1:46:01] he just climbed up in the arms of his
[1:46:03] father was just like a child
[1:46:05] everything was his everything obeyed him
[1:46:09] because he was god's child and the child
[1:46:13] is the heir
[1:46:13] of all things right and when man
[1:46:16] fell he lost this but and now
[1:46:20] when he what he lost in the fall christ
[1:46:23] came as a redeemer i want you to know
[1:46:27] jesus brought back everything that man
[1:46:30] lost
[1:46:32] so therefore through the new birth you
[1:46:34] have the ability to be led
[1:46:36] as adam was and be a channel to work the
[1:46:39] will of god through
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:42] amen now so god came
[1:46:46] there to bring us back to fellowship
[1:46:49] and relationship with god to be his sons
[1:46:52] and his daughters
[1:46:54] and he came to restore back everything
[1:46:56] that adam lost
[1:46:57] in the fall through redemption
[1:47:01] he offered you a renewed mind
[1:47:05] that your mind could be transformed by
[1:47:08] the renewing of your mind
[1:47:11] amen so we're we're invited then to be
[1:47:14] molded into his image not to take on the
[1:47:17] image of the beast
[1:47:19] of what the world is now taking on the
[1:47:22] image of
[1:47:23] why is all this violence and hate and
[1:47:25] all this stuff
[1:47:26] because they are taken and manifest in
[1:47:29] the image
[1:47:31] of the beast itself of the depravity of
[1:47:35] man
[1:47:36] why is there fatherless homes why is
[1:47:38] there motherless homes
[1:47:41] come on why is there marriage and
[1:47:43] divorce and remarriage and all this
[1:47:45] other stuff that is going on today
[1:47:48] amen it's because that man has left god
[1:47:52] but where god offers the redemption for
[1:47:55] you to
[1:47:55] take on his mind and then you'll think
[1:47:58] differently
[1:48:00] you'll think differently about
[1:48:02] everything from drug to alcohol to the
[1:48:04] way you dress the way you talk
[1:48:08] amen even your attitude about the bible
[1:48:11] whether whether it's relative or not
[1:48:15] everything will change when you take on
[1:48:17] the mind of god
[1:48:19] amen now so you're invited to come into
[1:48:22] his image and take on
[1:48:23] his image i want to stress it to you
[1:48:26] remember
[1:48:27] the bride he will marry will be in his
[1:48:30] image
[1:48:31] she will be of his species she will be
[1:48:34] of his kind
[1:48:35] she will be bold of his bone and flesh
[1:48:37] of his flesh
[1:48:38] and life of his life and power of his
[1:48:40] power
[1:48:41] she is him
[1:48:46] now so then
[1:48:49] when we let his character be in us then
[1:48:52] we become his sons
[1:48:53] having the mind of christ and that
[1:48:56] because your mind
[1:48:58] makes your character it molds the
[1:48:59] character of a son
[1:49:01] now again in the fundamental foundations
[1:49:06] of faith
[1:49:07] brother branham said now the thing of it
[1:49:10] is since he restored man back to his
[1:49:12] place
[1:49:13] now since redemption man
[1:49:16] in the fall lost his conscience
[1:49:20] of what the father put him on earth to
[1:49:23] do
[1:49:26] and that's the whole thing you lost your
[1:49:28] conscience
[1:49:30] of why you're here
[1:49:34] we are not here to be uh anarchist
[1:49:38] we're not here to be caught up in the
[1:49:41] world movements
[1:49:45] we are not here to be caught up in
[1:49:48] and even trying to fix society
[1:49:54] that is not a message
[1:49:57] amen it's the wrong message if that's
[1:49:59] what's being preached
[1:50:00] that's what brother branham would deal
[1:50:02] with it wasn't it wasn't that he
[1:50:04] disagreed with martin luther on how
[1:50:06] martin luther king on how people were
[1:50:08] treated they were mistreated
[1:50:10] but he was saying that you can never
[1:50:12] really get
[1:50:14] social justice by passing laws
[1:50:19] the only thing that will bring it is by
[1:50:23] baptism of the holy ghost and then
[1:50:26] nobody's big and nobody's little
[1:50:29] and then we're of all of one race and
[1:50:31] that's the god race
[1:50:33] [Applause]
[1:50:35] and that that way nobody this and ain't
[1:50:37] important and this
[1:50:38] is important we're all imparted because
[1:50:41] we're all god's children
[1:50:43] [Applause]
[1:50:44] and when we preach the baptism of the
[1:50:46] holy ghost and the
[1:50:47] power of god in the supernatural and
[1:50:50] people get born again
[1:50:52] it takes our prejudice out of your life
[1:50:55] it takes out the big idea big you big me
[1:50:58] and little you
[1:51:00] [Applause]
[1:51:01] [Music]
[1:51:03] that's why brother bratton would often
[1:51:05] say the calico dress can hug
[1:51:07] with the silk one amen call him
[1:51:10] sister
[1:51:13] exactly amen the overall can
[1:51:18] hug the you know the man in the tuxedo
[1:51:20] because
[1:51:21] and say brother because there's no
[1:51:24] difference
[1:51:28] we all become of one class
[1:51:31] that's the god class
[1:51:34] amen but you see but again
[1:51:38] uh again as we're talking about this man
[1:51:42] fell in the fall lost conscience
[1:51:45] of what the father put us on earth
[1:51:48] to do i wonder sometimes if we
[1:51:52] miss even you know what the bride is
[1:51:55] supposed to do
[1:51:57] well what are we to be in this age in
[1:51:59] this time what kind of people are we to
[1:52:01] be
[1:52:02] are you with me amen so again we
[1:52:06] we he says in other words and he
[1:52:09] explained this way
[1:52:10] all diploma all the plumbing
[1:52:15] as it was in our brains the outlet the
[1:52:17] faith has been
[1:52:18] clogged up with business affair
[1:52:23] with home life with domestic things
[1:52:26] it's all become so clogged up until god
[1:52:29] came operate through those channels
[1:52:31] that he made man for he made you for
[1:52:35] something different
[1:52:37] than just living here and making a life
[1:52:40] here in
[1:52:41] laodicea god made you to be a
[1:52:44] son or a daughter of god amen to take
[1:52:48] dominion
[1:52:49] over sin over unrighteousness over
[1:52:52] sickness over disease
[1:52:55] are you with me church amen but we have
[1:52:59] let
[1:52:59] our channels become clogged through the
[1:53:02] fall
[1:53:03] you know ours our our thoughts are set
[1:53:06] on
[1:53:06] self-perseverance or self-perseveration
[1:53:09] i mean
[1:53:10] and we're gonna preserve ourselves and
[1:53:12] we're going to do this
[1:53:13] and we're going to try that and and
[1:53:16] we're worried about
[1:53:17] all of the life's affairs until we
[1:53:20] forget
[1:53:21] why we are here
[1:53:26] why are we here
[1:53:30] until god can't operate through those
[1:53:32] channels
[1:53:34] the channel is clogged where god can't
[1:53:36] operate through
[1:53:37] that's what the message came for
[1:53:40] was to open up our hearts to the full
[1:53:43] word of god
[1:53:46] amen dr moses brother bradham said it
[1:53:49] this way he said
[1:53:50] you know what i began to believe
[1:53:53] christian friend that we're living
[1:53:55] in the beginning of the greatest time
[1:53:58] that the world has ever witnessed
[1:54:01] now he was back there in 55 when he said
[1:54:03] that that was a year after i was born
[1:54:06] but he says we're living in the
[1:54:08] beginning of the greatest time
[1:54:10] the world has ever witnessed
[1:54:14] and i just believe that all the lines
[1:54:17] are getting
[1:54:18] unclogged you know clogged up with all
[1:54:21] kinds of doctrines
[1:54:23] theologies all kinds of stuff unbelief
[1:54:26] has been handed down from generation to
[1:54:29] generation
[1:54:29] oh there's no such thing as healing days
[1:54:32] and miracles are passed
[1:54:33] and we just automatically believe it
[1:54:38] it says in getting in the spirit he said
[1:54:41] he said um
[1:54:43] um you know he's talking about making
[1:54:45] those valleys full of ditches
[1:54:48] it's a it's a story of the bible the
[1:54:50] days of eliza
[1:54:52] where he was told you know where they
[1:54:54] didn't have water so well
[1:54:55] you know dick valley's full of ditches
[1:54:58] he said about daylight they began to
[1:55:00] notice
[1:55:01] the waters came and they didn't know
[1:55:02] where it came from
[1:55:04] it was there all the time they had just
[1:55:06] clogged it up
[1:55:08] and he said there's power in the church
[1:55:10] i can tell you and i can tell any
[1:55:12] minister
[1:55:13] i can show you where god gave the church
[1:55:15] power to heal the sick cast out devils
[1:55:18] all these things and now you come and
[1:55:20] put your finger on the scripture where
[1:55:22] jesus said now i take it back away from
[1:55:24] the church
[1:55:25] but what he said what's happened what's
[1:55:27] the matter you've got it clogged up
[1:55:30] your own self-made ideas of it has
[1:55:33] clogged it up amen i can tell you what
[1:55:37] jesus promised in the last day and show
[1:55:39] you
[1:55:40] that these signs that you've seen done
[1:55:42] that the spirit of god would come into
[1:55:44] the church
[1:55:44] and so and so visions and and so forth
[1:55:47] like that
[1:55:48] as he's doing and you try to disprove it
[1:55:50] one time and
[1:55:51] find out where you're at
[1:55:54] amen he talks about the queen of sheba
[1:55:58] how that she was a seeker she came from
[1:56:01] a far country seeking
[1:56:04] her real faith and set her heart to see
[1:56:06] whether whether or not what she was
[1:56:08] hearing was the truth
[1:56:10] she was determined he said if the rumor
[1:56:13] of this meeting because she'd heard a
[1:56:14] rumor
[1:56:15] and she comes from way from the far east
[1:56:17] to the meeting he said
[1:56:18] if the rumor of this meeting in
[1:56:20] indianapolis
[1:56:22] had only a set up a career a creation of
[1:56:25] people
[1:56:26] to come and see whether this bunch of
[1:56:28] people has the real holy spirit or not
[1:56:31] amen to see whether there's such thing
[1:56:33] as a baptism of the spirit
[1:56:35] and they would have done it if they
[1:56:37] hadn't choked their life
[1:56:39] out with some church creed
[1:56:42] or some worldly amusement
[1:56:46] but i have to believe there's some
[1:56:48] seekers somewhere
[1:56:49] [Music]
[1:56:50] that says i don't want my life choked
[1:56:52] out
[1:56:54] amen and i'm not going to do it with
[1:56:56] worldly music or some creed or
[1:56:58] or some theology but i'm going to
[1:57:00] believe that jesus christ
[1:57:01] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:57:04] and i'm going to become a channel
[1:57:06] that the word can flow through
[1:57:11] handwriting on the wall he said the vine
[1:57:13] of formulism
[1:57:15] is growing around the church and choking
[1:57:18] the spiritual life of the church
[1:57:20] so god send in the sickle and the
[1:57:23] grubbing hole
[1:57:24] and cut all the weeds that choking out
[1:57:26] the church
[1:57:28] amen all all the great spiritual
[1:57:32] blessings of the church that deserve
[1:57:34] it deserves it that jesus died for that
[1:57:37] it might receive
[1:57:38] maybe a hundredfold tonight of a great
[1:57:40] shower of his blessings upon the people
[1:57:44] now i'd say this is the way we ought to
[1:57:48] be
[1:57:50] god make us a place
[1:57:53] where that a rumor goes out
[1:57:58] amen there's a real healer in the church
[1:58:02] amen that church isn't barren but that
[1:58:05] church has
[1:58:06] life in it there's a power laying in
[1:58:09] that church
[1:58:10] in those people there are people that
[1:58:12] believe
[1:58:13] a man that preached that he's the same
[1:58:15] yesterday today of her
[1:58:16] and the practice of praying people of
[1:58:19] people that's calling on god
[1:58:23] amen people that are more interested in
[1:58:26] his presence
[1:58:27] amen that worried about where they're
[1:58:28] sitting in the church
[1:58:30] they just want his presence they want
[1:58:32] his power they want him to move
[1:58:34] at the church a people who's calling on
[1:58:38] god
[1:58:39] lord change lives amen
[1:58:43] there are those that are dying they're
[1:58:45] the lost that needs to be saved
[1:58:47] lord let me find lay some soul on my
[1:58:50] heart
[1:58:50] and love that soul through me let me be
[1:58:54] a witness of my
[1:58:55] job in school or wherever i have a
[1:58:57] testimony of jesus christ
[1:59:03] after promised restoration of the word
[1:59:06] and the power are we going to be
[1:59:10] just slumped down again choked
[1:59:13] by unbelief
[1:59:17] it was denominational moves it choked
[1:59:19] the spirit
[1:59:20] out saying days of miracles are passed
[1:59:24] it is easy believism that has choked out
[1:59:27] the true baptism of the holy ghost
[1:59:31] we have choked out the spirit of god for
[1:59:33] wisdom
[1:59:37] wisdom versus faith he said now the
[1:59:39] protestants got choked out it choked the
[1:59:41] spirit
[1:59:42] right out of them when they begin to
[1:59:44] take wisdom instead of faith in the word
[1:59:47] the wisdom in the organization the
[1:59:50] organizational wisdom instead of faith
[1:59:52] in the word now let me just stop here
[1:59:56] i want you to look at john wesley's move
[2:00:00] everybody's heard of the methodist right
[2:00:04] it was a sanctification move
[2:00:07] now john wesley's movement
[2:00:10] well the hell was you in the wesley
[2:00:12] movement
[2:00:13] the methodists yeah yeah all right
[2:00:17] here's a man right there
[2:00:18] from the methodist church god delivered
[2:00:22] him
[2:00:24] you know why you know why he's here
[2:00:27] because he saw the fallacy of it
[2:00:31] you know why he isn't an elder in that
[2:00:33] church and a deacon in there and
[2:00:35] because he promised him every kind of
[2:00:36] position
[2:00:39] amen because they had homosexuals in the
[2:00:42] pulpit
[2:00:45] come on amen isn't it good to know
[2:00:48] hey you may meet the next brother l
[2:00:53] that is out there in the system
[2:00:55] somewhere that is just
[2:00:56] longing to hear the truth
[2:00:58] [Applause]
[2:01:01] who's going to meet the next brother
[2:01:03] album sister felicia
[2:01:06] amen and how who's going to be the next
[2:01:09] one
[2:01:10] i mean they're hungry souls that are out
[2:01:12] there just like them
[2:01:14] [Applause]
[2:01:16] glory to god now
[2:01:19] but let me just say you see what
[2:01:22] happened john
[2:01:22] wesley's move started out as the saudi
[2:01:26] methodists
[2:01:28] they had a move of god and as the word
[2:01:31] was preached they would
[2:01:32] fall out under the spirit and their
[2:01:34] lives would be changed
[2:01:37] they would actually fall out they they
[2:01:39] would they would go get
[2:01:41] water and throw it in their faces there
[2:01:43] to wake them up again
[2:01:45] because they'd get so overcome with the
[2:01:48] spirit
[2:01:51] huh
[2:01:55] you can't even find the breath of the
[2:01:56] spirit there anymore
[2:02:00] amen it got choked out many years ago
[2:02:03] by modernism by formalism
[2:02:07] by lifeless programs
[2:02:11] hello let me just read you what a
[2:02:14] study that i just did recently and i
[2:02:17] only did it on the methodist church
[2:02:18] because it was the last move in the
[2:02:20] sixth age
[2:02:22] but methodist methodism was transformed
[2:02:26] from a religion of poor people
[2:02:29] to one of middle class respectability
[2:02:34] so you know they were transformed from
[2:02:37] these poor people
[2:02:39] who shouted rejoice have spirit moving
[2:02:42] among them
[2:02:43] live sanctified are you with me
[2:02:47] amen they they they um
[2:02:51] you know the enthusiastic groups that
[2:02:53] was in that holiness movement
[2:02:56] fell away broke away
[2:02:59] changes begin in the leadership
[2:03:03] as the elder was redesignated as
[2:03:06] district superintendent no longer was
[2:03:09] the elder supposed to be an
[2:03:11] inspirational leader
[2:03:13] but now he was the business and
[2:03:15] administrative
[2:03:16] office think of that
[2:03:20] it didn't require him to be spiritual
[2:03:24] it required him at being good at money
[2:03:27] and programs and building up a church
[2:03:32] attracting members
[2:03:36] come on amen and transform them
[2:03:39] from poor people to striving to be
[2:03:43] more a little bit more uppity
[2:03:46] the transformation of methodistism in
[2:03:49] the 19th century
[2:03:50] from the religion of the unwashed and
[2:03:52] uneducated to a denomination of
[2:03:55] respectability
[2:03:56] owed much to the denomination's embrace
[2:04:00] of education
[2:04:05] methodists by the mid-1960s century
[2:04:09] had established more colleges than
[2:04:12] all but one other denomination
[2:04:16] belief in the effectiveness of christian
[2:04:18] education for children
[2:04:20] also contributed to the prominence of
[2:04:22] education and methodism
[2:04:24] the poor farmers who compromise early
[2:04:27] methodism
[2:04:28] modernize themselves move to town use
[2:04:31] the moral standards
[2:04:32] and in interpersonal skills and they
[2:04:35] learn
[2:04:35] that they learned in church to make
[2:04:37] themselves middle class
[2:04:41] as methodism sought towards social
[2:04:43] respectability
[2:04:45] in the 19th century churches replaced
[2:04:50] the primitive emotionalism of camp
[2:04:53] meeting conversions
[2:04:56] with a more gentile intellectual process
[2:05:00] that led incrementally to conversion
[2:05:06] in other words you grow into token life
[2:05:10] you involve into being a christian
[2:05:14] we're going to teach you how to become
[2:05:18] good
[2:05:20] and that took the place of the primitive
[2:05:24] emotionalism of church me a camp meeting
[2:05:27] conversions
[2:05:30] i'll tell you what give me the old camp
[2:05:32] meeting conversions
[2:05:34] give me the power of the holy ghost am i
[2:05:37] not some intellectual con
[2:05:39] you know a concept where we kind of
[2:05:41] teach people how to be good
[2:05:43] and nice and good citizens and our class
[2:05:46] and
[2:05:47] and everything else no that's not what
[2:05:49] we want we want
[2:05:50] genuine new births changes in their
[2:05:53] lives
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:57] children's literature published by the
[2:05:59] sunday school union taught
[2:06:01] the more respectable process of
[2:06:03] conversion
[2:06:05] the methodists were moving away from
[2:06:07] revivals and toward the notion
[2:06:09] of christian nurture that showed that
[2:06:12] children were the future
[2:06:15] so we have how to get along in marriage
[2:06:19] classes
[2:06:20] and financial classes and this becomes
[2:06:24] what we need instead of an old-fashioned
[2:06:28] altar
[2:06:33] and we go to educating the people
[2:06:36] into conversion how to be successful
[2:06:40] and a good person
[2:06:46] and this took away the spirit and the
[2:06:48] experience with god
[2:06:50] no more this shouting methodist when
[2:06:54] they become so overcome with the spirit
[2:06:56] until they would pass out quaking under
[2:06:59] the presence of god
[2:07:01] they would talk the more respectable
[2:07:04] conversion this led the methodist church
[2:07:08] today down the path of worldliness until
[2:07:12] 2020 this year the lgbt
[2:07:16] movement took over the leadership of the
[2:07:18] methodist church
[2:07:27] this is where it leads when we get away
[2:07:30] from the supernatural
[2:07:32] when we go toward the intellectual
[2:07:34] conception
[2:07:36] when we go into training come on rather
[2:07:39] than conversion
[2:07:42] when we go hey even when we're going to
[2:07:44] to cater to
[2:07:45] what the young people are doing and
[2:07:47] they're you know what the young people
[2:07:49] want to dress like it
[2:07:50] well whatever and we can't say anything
[2:07:52] about holiness and things anymore
[2:07:54] because
[2:07:55] we're catered to the young people we
[2:07:56] don't want to scare them off i'll tell
[2:07:58] you what i want to scare
[2:07:59] hell out of them
[2:08:03] hallelujah hey man i want to scare the
[2:08:06] devil out of them
[2:08:07] i will see the holy ghost fall and satan
[2:08:10] cast out
[2:08:11] and their lives changed and not
[2:08:13] conformed to me but confirmed in the
[2:08:15] word of god
[2:08:16] [Applause]
[2:08:21] i woke you up on that one
[2:08:25] this one brother branham said in the
[2:08:27] deceived church by the world
[2:08:29] every one of us everyone tries to think
[2:08:32] he's a little smarter than the other man
[2:08:35] each denomination method to say we got
[2:08:37] the smartest man
[2:08:40] the baptist say will say in the church
[2:08:42] of christ and so forth we're the
[2:08:44] smartest
[2:08:45] our people just don't let don't let the
[2:08:47] ordinary man go out and preach the
[2:08:49] gospel
[2:08:51] but they hand pick them oh god have
[2:08:53] mercy hand pick them until
[2:08:54] they're documented with a certain
[2:08:56] doctrine that they put them in the
[2:08:57] church
[2:08:58] and god can't touch him in no way i want
[2:09:01] somebody to preach to me
[2:09:03] that's been handpicked by the holy ghost
[2:09:06] god is raised up not picked by men
[2:09:09] or denominations amen
[2:09:13] all knowledge is oh we know all about it
[2:09:15] and someone don't know the first
[2:09:16] alphabet of the holy spirit
[2:09:18] they deny it amount i'll tell you what
[2:09:22] church the further we go along the more
[2:09:24] that you're going to see
[2:09:25] unani preachers about men who are not
[2:09:29] truly called of god but are placed in
[2:09:32] there
[2:09:32] for whatever reason
[2:09:36] amen we've already seen too many that
[2:09:38] mother called or daddy called or
[2:09:40] somebody else called instead of god
[2:09:42] called
[2:09:44] but you get a god called man he answers
[2:09:47] to god
[2:09:48] amen he'll preach the word of god he'll
[2:09:50] preach holiness
[2:09:52] he'll preach the power of god come on
[2:09:54] amen because he's called a god
[2:09:57] he wasn't set by man
[2:10:00] amen amen you see changes began in the
[2:10:04] leadership
[2:10:05] as the elder was redesignated as
[2:10:08] district superintendent sounds a little
[2:10:10] better don't it no longer was the elder
[2:10:14] to be an inspirational leader but now
[2:10:17] he's a business
[2:10:18] and administrative officer
[2:10:22] deceived church by the world brother
[2:10:25] branham said this reminds me of a little
[2:10:28] book
[2:10:28] and he tells a story of a little book
[2:10:31] that he'd read and he
[2:10:32] repeats the story and he says
[2:10:37] he said there that one one day in a
[2:10:40] great chicken pin
[2:10:43] there was a certain little rooster that
[2:10:45] thought he had all the knowledge
[2:10:47] to be known he flies up on a box
[2:10:51] you know and pets on it with this bill
[2:10:53] of four or five times
[2:10:55] and throws his little head back and
[2:10:57] forth and crowed like you never heard a
[2:10:59] rooster crow
[2:11:01] and he finally attracted the other's
[2:11:03] attentions and said
[2:11:04] ladies and gentlemen of this chicken pen
[2:11:09] i'd like to speak to you all this
[2:11:11] morning on some great educational
[2:11:13] program we have just designed
[2:11:16] i've required i've acquired a lot of
[2:11:18] knowledge in my study and
[2:11:20] he pulls his glasses over his bill and
[2:11:24] and he says i've i've decided that we
[2:11:27] chickens
[2:11:28] can better ourselves by knowledge
[2:11:31] by more knowledge therefore i tell you
[2:11:34] if we can just
[2:11:35] dig and work in a certain pen or whole
[2:11:38] we'll find a certain vitamin
[2:11:39] that'll make us grow better and prettier
[2:11:42] feathers
[2:11:43] and i'll tell you how we can embetter
[2:11:45] ourselves in many ways
[2:11:48] and the little pulitz with their little
[2:11:50] red cones just
[2:11:51] cackled and said oh but isn't he a
[2:11:54] darling
[2:11:56] and they admired him oh isn't he a
[2:11:58] brilliant little rooster
[2:12:01] he said it reminds me of seminary
[2:12:03] preachers
[2:12:04] such a brilliant man there's no need of
[2:12:07] us
[2:12:07] hanging around with the rest of the
[2:12:09] chickens we ought to go with him
[2:12:12] well before this little fella got
[2:12:14] through with his speech
[2:12:16] there was another chicken that didn't
[2:12:18] have bright feathers
[2:12:21] and he come running up from the chin the
[2:12:22] rest of the chicken yard he said boys
[2:12:25] just a minute i just heard the latest
[2:12:27] bulletin on the radio
[2:12:29] that chickens just went up four cents a
[2:12:31] pound and we're all going to slaughter
[2:12:33] tomorrow
[2:12:34] so what good your knowledge going to do
[2:12:38] and he said brother all the world the
[2:12:41] knowledge we can accumulate
[2:12:43] what good does it do we're six foot of
[2:12:45] dirt
[2:12:46] we're all dying by inches and minutes
[2:12:49] our knowledge means nothing
[2:12:50] we want to know him
[2:12:55] amen you know again he said
[2:12:59] he said a guy he told him another story
[2:13:01] of a little canary bird
[2:13:04] and this little canary bird he was
[2:13:06] really struck on his self and with such
[2:13:08] self-importance you know thought he had
[2:13:11] all the knowledge that he would ever
[2:13:12] need to
[2:13:13] to know he could tell all the rest of
[2:13:16] the canary birds
[2:13:17] all about the human being and he flies
[2:13:21] up on his cage and begins to
[2:13:23] to to speak about the human being and
[2:13:26] all that he knew about them and
[2:13:28] all of a sudden he walks up a
[2:13:31] a professor from a big college somewhere
[2:13:35] and begins to speak some high polished
[2:13:37] words to him
[2:13:39] and the little fellow just batted his
[2:13:42] eyes
[2:13:43] and turned his head and he said he had
[2:13:47] ears he could hear him why
[2:13:52] but he didn't know what he was talking
[2:13:54] about
[2:13:56] because all he had was a canary brain
[2:14:00] he hadn't got a human brain so he can't
[2:14:02] think like a human
[2:14:03] and neither can a human be and think
[2:14:05] like god
[2:14:06] you're human and all the world in
[2:14:08] knowledge is no more than a canary brain
[2:14:11] and all that you do you just hurt
[2:14:13] yourself with it
[2:14:14] you've got to have the mind of christ
[2:14:17] [Music]
[2:14:18] and that's the reason he said people
[2:14:20] joined organizations substitute a
[2:14:23] handshake
[2:14:24] today they substitute i believe the
[2:14:26] message and i believe god sent a prophet
[2:14:28] or i've got a tape library
[2:14:32] and the tape is my token and that's my
[2:14:35] holy ghost and
[2:14:36] and you know i i'm i'm gonna build a
[2:14:38] tape home
[2:14:40] you know what it is they don't know what
[2:14:42] the new birth is
[2:14:44] they have bypassed the new birth they
[2:14:47] we mean so they want to substitute for
[2:14:50] it
[2:14:50] and they're educating the children and
[2:14:52] brainwashing them
[2:14:54] into thinking if you believe a prophet
[2:14:56] you're going to be saved
[2:14:58] you better know jesus amen the pen he
[2:15:02] said the pentecostal people are just as
[2:15:04] bad trying to substitute something
[2:15:06] they try to substitute speaking in
[2:15:07] tongues
[2:15:09] right amen the others they want in class
[2:15:12] and just be
[2:15:13] so classy we'll shake hands join church
[2:15:16] sprinkled or baptized
[2:15:17] and he said they're afraid of the new
[2:15:19] birth he says i
[2:15:20] sometimes believe random tabernacles
[2:15:22] getting believed we're getting afraid of
[2:15:24] and i sometimes believe the whole
[2:15:26] message move is getting afraid of the
[2:15:28] new birth
[2:15:30] amen he said we we all know about a
[2:15:33] birth
[2:15:34] i don't care where it is whereabouts
[2:15:36] it's a mess
[2:15:38] a baby's born on a sheck pile on a hard
[2:15:40] floor or a pink decorated hospital room
[2:15:43] it's a mess anyhow
[2:15:44] a birthday calf a birth of anything is a
[2:15:48] mess
[2:15:49] and the new birth is nothing less than a
[2:15:51] mess
[2:15:52] but people go get so starchy we'll never
[2:15:56] go over where this
[2:15:57] we'll we'll go over where they shake
[2:15:58] hands we'll we'll go everywhere they
[2:16:00] don't bawl and cry
[2:16:02] and beat on the altar and cry out
[2:16:08] you know that this very same thing
[2:16:09] happened here sometime ago
[2:16:11] in a in a youth convention where they
[2:16:15] just had some teacher give some
[2:16:17] intellectual talk
[2:16:18] never had an altar called never had a
[2:16:20] move of god
[2:16:21] never had a crime there was never a
[2:16:22] dying out to sin and kids sitting there
[2:16:25] on pornography dabbling in drugs
[2:16:28] you insects
[2:16:32] needing jesus and just tell them you
[2:16:36] know
[2:16:36] how you know we're going to just accept
[2:16:38] the message and grow into christ and
[2:16:41] we'll just go around and you know your
[2:16:43] urine all you just need to do is just
[2:16:45] grow a mature little more some
[2:16:47] intellectual knowledge
[2:16:54] and somebody had the gall to say
[2:16:56] afterwards
[2:16:57] well wow i like these kind of services
[2:16:59] where there ain't no altar call and
[2:17:01] ain't nobody crying and
[2:17:03] snotting and everything else and crying
[2:17:05] out to god
[2:17:06] and i say you're a bunch of backslidden
[2:17:08] church members that don't know
[2:17:10] the power of the holy ghost you need the
[2:17:12] supernatural
[2:17:14] and the supernatural doesn't come by
[2:17:17] fancy teaching
[2:17:18] and intellectual knowledge even if
[2:17:20] you're preaching quote
[2:17:22] it doesn't come that way it comes by the
[2:17:24] power of god
[2:17:25] that changes your life
[2:17:29] the new birth he said is no less than a
[2:17:32] mess
[2:17:33] but people get so starchy we go
[2:17:36] where they shake hands and we and we'll
[2:17:39] go over where they don't bawl and cry
[2:17:41] and beat on the altar and cry out
[2:17:43] you want to be too human i'm talking to
[2:17:46] your prophet saying this
[2:17:48] we what we need as a birth dying out to
[2:17:51] bring forth
[2:17:52] life an old seed an old potato seed
[2:17:56] potato
[2:17:57] you take that potato put in the ground
[2:17:59] you can until you can have new potatoes
[2:18:02] all the potatoes gotta rot a corn can't
[2:18:05] produce new life
[2:18:06] until it's rotten right and a man or
[2:18:09] woman can never have a birth a new birth
[2:18:11] until they
[2:18:12] their intellectuals and their own self
[2:18:15] is rotted
[2:18:16] dead down at the altar scream
[2:18:19] and get all messed up to a place the
[2:18:21] scar starts
[2:18:22] gets out of your collar
[2:18:26] amen i'll tell you what it's time that
[2:18:28] some starch gets out of
[2:18:29] our collars amen that we become a
[2:18:32] channel that the holy ghost can move
[2:18:34] through
[2:18:35] amen where the spirit of god can flow in
[2:18:38] the church
[2:18:39] and we create an atmosphere where
[2:18:42] healings take place where deliverance
[2:18:44] take place
[2:18:44] where the holy ghost moves
[2:18:46] [Music]
[2:18:49] amen you're born again by the spirit of
[2:18:53] god i don't care
[2:18:54] if you squall speak in tongues jump up
[2:18:57] and down
[2:18:58] flop like a chicken with his head off
[2:19:00] you're bringing forth new life
[2:19:02] but we substituted something for it we
[2:19:04] wanted the classical way
[2:19:06] and look at the methodists they wanted
[2:19:09] it the classical way
[2:19:11] they wanted to get to where it was not
[2:19:13] an old camp meeting revival experience
[2:19:17] i tell you what i want a church to be i
[2:19:20] want it to be a retrence that's obvious
[2:19:23] god
[2:19:23] of people who know their god a people
[2:19:26] who the spirit of god can move about
[2:19:28] and sweep across a congregation
[2:19:34] brother branham said oh yeah he said
[2:19:35] they're pregnant they're expecting
[2:19:37] something but she
[2:19:38] because he's bringing forth members but
[2:19:41] she don't want none of these screaming
[2:19:42] hollering us blabbering acts 238
[2:19:45] youngins
[2:19:47] oh no miserable creatures you know why
[2:19:50] they do that
[2:19:51] because just like any baby when life
[2:19:54] comes in that first breath comes in
[2:19:56] they scream out
[2:19:59] brother branham always told us if they
[2:20:01] don't scream out then the doctor gives
[2:20:03] him a little spanking
[2:20:06] he said he picks them up and puts a
[2:20:08] little he called it protoplasma
[2:20:10] stimulation i don't know what that means
[2:20:13] exactly except
[2:20:14] a spank on the bottom but you get that
[2:20:17] baby to breathing
[2:20:19] make him mad enough to cry
[2:20:22] amen do whatever you got to do to get
[2:20:24] that baby breathing come on
[2:20:27] amen that's what the preacher's got to
[2:20:28] do a lot of time he's got to make him
[2:20:30] mad enough to say
[2:20:32] i want jesus in my life i'm tired of sin
[2:20:35] i'm tired of the way i've been
[2:20:37] i'm tired of complacency i'm tired of
[2:20:39] being lukewarm
[2:20:40] i want the power of god in my life
[2:20:47] oh brother tim i want to be pregnant
[2:20:49] with the words you know
[2:20:50] the word birth word experience and
[2:20:53] the word you know you know it's it's not
[2:20:56] all this
[2:20:57] emotional stuff and brother branham said
[2:21:00] so you don't want to be impregnated with
[2:21:01] the word
[2:21:02] because that's the only kind the word
[2:21:05] can bring
[2:21:05] forth
[2:21:08] so i wonder what we're calling the word
[2:21:13] some type of he says you you said
[2:21:16] born of the spirit it has a spirit of
[2:21:19] god in it
[2:21:20] no intellectual church joined creed
[2:21:23] going bobbed hair
[2:21:24] painted faith no sense of that and that
[2:21:26] at all you don't find that in the word
[2:21:28] of god you find
[2:21:31] what the methodist didn't want an
[2:21:33] old-fashioned
[2:21:35] sanctified holy ghost-filled child
[2:21:39] born of the spirit of god screaming
[2:21:41] hollering shouting praising god
[2:21:45] that's what you'll find where the word
[2:21:47] is preached
[2:21:49] amen but they're so impregnated with
[2:21:51] satan's knowledge
[2:21:53] until that they have accepted the
[2:21:55] intellectual conception
[2:21:58] they might know no more about god than
[2:22:00] nothing their wisdom
[2:22:01] has strangled the holy spirit away from
[2:22:03] them
[2:22:06] now
[2:22:20] jesus thought it not robbery
[2:22:24] to be equal with god but he made of
[2:22:28] himself of no reputation
[2:22:31] and he humbled himself even to the death
[2:22:34] of the cross
[2:22:36] now god in return is looking for a
[2:22:39] people
[2:22:40] who's not trying to make a reputation
[2:22:44] who's not trying to be somebody but they
[2:22:47] don't think it's robbery
[2:22:49] to be born of his bone in flesh of his
[2:22:51] flesh and a joint air with him
[2:22:55] and they're willing to lay down their
[2:22:57] intellect
[2:23:01] even to the death of the cross even to
[2:23:04] death to self
[2:23:06] to let the word of god be supreme
[2:23:11] god wants to tell you
[2:23:15] you know we're told all the time
[2:23:19] we're human we're human exalt that human
[2:23:21] you know hey
[2:23:22] you know be good to yourself um you know
[2:23:25] that this is what the world says
[2:23:27] the church says you can't overcome
[2:23:30] you're human you're human you're human
[2:23:36] and god's trying to tell you
[2:23:39] you're not human you're a son of god
[2:23:44] by the new birth
[2:23:47] god's trying to let you know that there
[2:23:50] is an overcoming power
[2:23:52] that if you will clean out the channel
[2:23:54] the holy spirit can flow through you
[2:23:56] and you can overcome sin and sin will be
[2:23:59] as dead as midnight
[2:24:03] god's trying to tell you again that you
[2:24:06] can be a son of god
[2:24:07] and the power of god can flow through
[2:24:09] you
[2:24:10] that you can be a channel through whom
[2:24:12] he can work through
[2:24:14] brother branham would tell us over and
[2:24:16] over again he said he
[2:24:18] would tell us he said that we're sons of
[2:24:20] god and deity
[2:24:22] dwells in the man and he said this may
[2:24:25] choke you
[2:24:26] but then he dwells in you well i'll tell
[2:24:29] you we need to start believing that
[2:24:30] until they don't strangle us no more
[2:24:33] till we realize it can flow out
[2:24:37] it's to who we are yes sir
[2:24:40] i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god
[2:24:45] and i'm tired of letting the devil put a
[2:24:48] put a foot or knee on my throat
[2:24:53] and keeping the breath out of my life
[2:24:57] but i want the holy ghost in this church
[2:25:00] take your stinking knee off
[2:25:03] free this bride let her breathe
[2:25:07] let her rise up in power in the glory of
[2:25:11] god
[2:25:11] and a people know their god and do
[2:25:15] exploits let's stand together
[2:25:29] maybe the next service i can come and
[2:25:31] tell you what this bride is supposed to
[2:25:33] be like

[2:25:40] because she's to be in his image and in
[2:25:43] his likeness
