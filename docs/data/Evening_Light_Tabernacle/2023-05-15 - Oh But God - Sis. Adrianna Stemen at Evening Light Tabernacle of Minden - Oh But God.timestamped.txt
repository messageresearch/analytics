[0:09] thank you
[0:21] I was buried beneath my Rebellion
[0:25] lost without hope of redemption
[0:29] blind in my need for a savior oh but God
[0:38] a Crush by the weight of my failures
[0:43] living the lie I created
[0:49] digging my grave without knowing oh but
[0:54] God

[1:00] which is he how you love me too much to
[1:05] let me stay lost
