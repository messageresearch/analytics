[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] located in North Louisiana evening light
[0:03] Tabernacle has always held forth the
[0:06] scripture that Jesus Christ is the same
[0:08] yesterday today and forever today we
[0:13] invite you to delve into the scripture
[0:14] with us as the ministry discusses God's
[0:17] truth in our day Oh everyone where the
[0:25] ministry came and even in my Tabernacle
[0:27] in Minden Louisiana on our last
[0:30] discussion that I shared what the late
[0:34] Henry Green once said God started the
[0:38] church the way he wanted it and now he
[0:41] wants to church the way he started it
[0:44] read a very interesting quote from
[0:47] George Gallup that he said in 1987 in a
[0:53] survey that he did said there's a little
[0:56] difference in ethical behavior between
[0:59] the church and the unchurched there's as
[1:03] much pilferage and dishonesty among the
[1:07] church as the unsure and I'm afraid that
[1:11] applies pretty much across the board
[1:13] religion per se is not really life
[1:17] changing people cited as important for
[1:20] instance in overcoming depression but it
[1:24] doesn't have primacy in determining
[1:28] determining behavior so you know we're
[1:32] living in a very difficult hour where
[1:38] people are very religious
[1:40] at least my name but yet in that very
[1:45] actions are really not portraying the
[1:48] very life of Christ it was Paul said it
[1:50] this way in Titus 1:16 they profess that
[1:53] they know God but it works they deny him
[1:58] being abominable and disobedient unto
[2:02] every good work reprobate so you know
[2:07] doesn't it seem today that churches are
[2:10] really just competing with the world
[2:13] for entertainment and they degenerate it
[2:17] into nothing more than a happy fun time
[2:19] what do you guys think are y'all seeing
[2:23] out there I feel that sometimes the
[2:26] emphasis has left getting people to a
[2:28] born-again experience and has went to
[2:32] filling a church
[2:33] well there's a great difference between
[2:34] a church member and a member of the body
[2:37] of Christ hmm it takes the power of God
[2:40] to regenerate a son or daughter of God
[2:43] and Jesus said in his own words except
[2:45] you'd be born again you shall not enter
[2:47] into the kingdom of God and the kingdom
[2:50] of heaven so I feel that the emphasis
[2:53] have changed from the early church that
[2:55] it doesn't matter what kind of ungentle
[2:59] as long as the church's failed and they
[3:03] get them Church or become a member but
[3:05] there's no salvation in a church
[3:07] there's only salvation in Christ and
[3:10] this becomes a big problem when we face
[3:13] that we're living in the last days yeah
[3:15] I'll call when I first became a
[3:16] Christian the church that I was formerly
[3:20] at would have rock bands come in and do
[3:23] concerts on Saturday night and this was
[3:25] things that would attract a younger
[3:26] generation it attracted but it never
[3:29] changed her life and what they did on
[3:31] Friday night they carried on into Sunday
[3:33] morning or Sunday evening because they
[3:36] had this group come in so first-hand
[3:38] experience I've seen the church and
[3:40] their tools or programs to attract they
[3:43] want the younger generation and they do
[3:45] it entertainment they do it by these
[3:47] things of that nature but it doesn't
[3:49] change their heart and I believe that
[3:51] you know as Jesus says in Matthew 16 he
[3:53] built the church on a revelation and I
[3:56] think that's where we got to go back to
[3:57] is what is that revelation and you know
[3:59] he even asked his disciples who do men
[4:01] say that I the Son of Man am well they
[4:03] named this one and that one of this one
[4:05] and that one but he says well who do you
[4:07] it's got to be a personal revelation who
[4:08] do you say that I am and when it becomes
[4:11] a personal revelation of who Jesus is to
[4:13] you then he begins to build his church
[4:16] on that revelation that rock and that's
[4:18] why he gave the keys to Peter but
[4:20] because Peter had a revelation of who
[4:22] Jesus
[4:23] Christ was yes he was no longer the man
[4:25] that fished with him he was no longer
[4:26] the man that walked the shores of
[4:27] Galilee he became a personal revelation
[4:30] it is his Savior his redeemer and I
[4:32] believe that's where the church has
[4:34] failed is they got an entertainment but
[4:36] they don't have the revelation they can
[4:38] get people to the doors they can get
[4:40] them under their roof but then what do
[4:41] they do with them once they get there
[4:43] other than entertaining and to Joe's
[4:45] point they're failing to get them to the
[4:48] new verse and I believe that's where
[4:50] modern religion has failed and they have
[4:52] to you know resort to like a like easy
[4:55] believe ISM you know you believe on the
[4:57] Lord you're saved you know they take it
[4:59] to that and then and thereby strip the
[5:02] power out of the gospel so therefore you
[5:04] can live in your sexual sins you can
[5:06] live you know smokes smoking and all
[5:09] this stuff that just as you did as a all
[5:12] you did was to become a person of the
[5:14] world to a church member you know and
[5:17] and the gospel has to have power and we
[5:19] witnessed that we've seen it in just a
[5:22] moment there's somebody in the presence
[5:24] of God and the Holy Ghost comes down and
[5:26] moves in their lives that we've every
[5:29] one of us can witness and chainsmokers
[5:31] that instantly the desire was gone
[5:34] Oh second Timothy three in verse one
[5:36] even talks about that in the last days
[5:37] it's gonna be perilous times men are
[5:39] gonna be lovers of themselves of
[5:40] pleasure and things of that nature and
[5:42] in verse 5 they have a form of godliness
[5:44] they deny the power what is that power
[5:47] is to power the Holy Ghost to change to
[5:51] live an overcoming life to live a life
[5:52] of victory to live a life of joy you're
[5:55] no longer beat down and succumbing to
[5:57] the pressures of this world you can rise
[5:59] above that because it's not you it's a
[6:01] power that's in you which is the Holy
[6:04] Ghost which is Jesus Christ which was
[6:05] the emphasis of the Apostles doctrine
[6:08] the entire New Testament the emphasis to
[6:11] the church was the born-again experience
[6:13] in the power of God no I mean that's
[6:15] Jesus first dr. right you must be born
[6:19] again must be born again so he
[6:21] introduced that as his very first basic
[6:24] doctrine to enter into the kingdom of
[6:26] God because he said without this new
[6:29] birth you will never see or understand
[6:31] the kingdom of God and and of course you
[6:34] ever go to heaven without that new part
[6:35] but it requires excuse me for
[6:38] interacting but when you think about the
[6:39] born-again experience what does the
[6:41] church teach the born-again experience
[6:43] is well they teach you know that we are
[6:47] all sinners and we just simply say a
[6:49] prayer or walk the aisle or worse yet
[6:52] you know raise your hands with your
[6:53] everybody's eyes closed and all heads
[6:56] bowed no we're good we're good with God
[6:58] we're going to heaven but just because
[7:00] we repeat repeated a few words and made
[7:03] a confession affects their teaching
[7:05] saved in your sins right instead of
[7:08] saved from your sins when Paul said sin
[7:10] shall have no dominion over you and if
[7:13] you love the world or the things of the
[7:14] world the love of God is even in you so
[7:17] the first church taught separation from
[7:19] the world the very first thing that a
[7:22] person does when he repents a separates
[7:24] himself from the things of the world
[7:26] which is contrary to God so the popular
[7:29] belief today though is it we can add
[7:32] Christ to our life but not subtract sin
[7:35] which means there was no repentance yeah
[7:38] which goes completely against the
[7:40] formula given by Peter on the day of
[7:43] Pentecost when they said how should we
[7:44] be saved yeah they have to repent which
[7:47] means turn away from those yeah that's
[7:49] and and then obey Him in water baptism
[7:53] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[7:56] remission of sins and you shall receive
[7:58] the gift of the Holy Ghost this is what
[8:00] empowers a person to live and overcome
[8:03] and victorious life so it's not just
[8:07] saying a few words are repeating a few
[8:10] words and sheepishly raising our hands
[8:12] while no one is looking but it is more
[8:15] than that it's were that you meet God
[8:17] and that and there is a change on your
[8:22] life you can never be the same again
[8:25] exactly the desires that you once have
[8:27] you have no more your desires are
[8:28] completely changed so that's what the
[8:30] born-again experience really is is
[8:33] having your nature change your desires
[8:35] change you don't think the same thoughts
[8:37] you don't have the same desires you
[8:39] don't have the same attractions because
[8:41] you've now been you know you've been
[8:43] born by the Word of God
[8:45] and that's what pulls you that's what
[8:46] yes inspires you and that's what no
[8:49] feeds your experience is not the
[8:50] entertainment of the world because that
[8:53] don't attract you any longer because
[8:54] you've been born again or even church
[8:56] membership right
[8:57] if church membership was enough then
[9:00] four thousand years of Jewish history
[9:02] wouldn't have needed to be changed right
[9:05] but knowing the law knowing the holiness
[9:08] of God being obedient to the law was not
[9:11] enough if it was then Jesus wouldn't
[9:15] have come and brought us a New Testament
[9:16] it took the blood to remedy sin it's the
[9:20] only remedy of sin Church joining will
[9:22] never do it doctrine will never do it
[9:24] it'll take the power of the blood of
[9:26] Jesus Christ to remedy sin but there's
[9:28] an effect of the power of the blood
[9:31] because more than it you can see that
[9:33] effect even Peters life just
[9:35] automatically you know a man that went
[9:37] from denying Jesus Christ
[9:39] very good until where he received the
[9:40] Holy Ghost there at the day of Pentecost
[9:42] and what's he do he's not shirking away
[9:45] from from him no more and hiding in the
[9:47] shadows no he's on the soapbox preaching
[9:50] a message in 3000 Souls and they're
[9:52] willing to die yes a visible change
[9:54] visible to any large membership had been
[9:56] enough Peter would have been good before
[9:58] that moment he'd been with Jesus all
[10:00] that discharge and yet Jesus told him
[10:02] when you're born again yes so being a
[10:05] follower of Jesus had not done him any
[10:07] good up to that moment very good yes so
[10:10] this easy believe ISM has a chokehold
[10:13] around many Christians today and it's a
[10:17] part of fulfilling of Mathew 24:24 of
[10:20] where that there are many that are being
[10:23] deceived and and so they in works they
[10:27] deny him because iniquity abounds the
[10:31] love of many waxes called the Bible said
[10:34] because why sin is abounding in the
[10:37] church yes and so the love for God is
[10:39] really waxing cold and therefore they
[10:42] gravitate to entertainment when it used
[10:46] to be the saving power of Jesus Christ
[10:49] was the drawing power for the church
[10:52] that would we come to church the cause
[10:55] it
[10:57] amen yeah you gathered together
[11:00] expecting to see the holy spirit move
[11:03] you gathered expecting to see the power
[11:05] of God change lives heal the sick
[11:07] deliver the bound draw the backslider
[11:10] bat and so there was the attraction of
[11:12] the gospel it had it had a power to it
[11:14] and you have a church that no longer has
[11:16] the power of God working it loses the
[11:19] attraction so now how do we get people
[11:20] here back to what you spoke on with the
[11:22] entertainment and with this and they
[11:24] give them in the door but there's
[11:25] nothing changing them because the power
[11:27] is not there so your Christianity at
[11:29] that point is no better than any other
[11:30] philosophy so then we have to bring the
[11:33] world in and their bands and their music
[11:36] and their rock-and-roll and their
[11:39] entertainment and and then we have to
[11:42] manufacture smoke screens make the you
[11:46] know so that smoke is coming up because
[11:49] it once was a cloud of glory that would
[11:51] fill the temple and then we have to have
[11:53] all our strobe lights because we no
[11:56] longer have the light of the Holy Ghost
[11:59] the pillar of fire in the midst of the
[12:01] church so now it's all manufactured by
[12:05] man rather than something that is real
[12:08] and that is concrete and that is life
[12:10] change and that has power in it what was
[12:13] the attraction in the first age when men
[12:18] were in catacombs when they were
[12:21] persecuted and killed for the name of
[12:22] Christ what was the attraction to the
[12:25] gospel why did the church continue to
[12:26] grow under those conditions when they
[12:29] didn't have strobe lights and didn't
[12:31] have smoke machines and didn't have air
[12:33] conditioned buildings what was the
[12:36] attraction that attracted people to
[12:38] endanger their own life to become a
[12:40] Christian it was true salvation in his
[12:44] reality reality and we can't get warm by
[12:46] a painted fire and we're not wanting to
[12:50] condemn people but there is a Bible
[12:52] pattern and I fear if we don't meet that
[12:55] Bible pattern
[12:56] the Bible says great was the fall of the
[12:59] house that was not built upon a true
[13:01] rock well you know don't we don't want
[13:03] to condemn I do feel like there is a
[13:07] some that I have with him a heart when
[13:10] when we see people that you know want to
[13:12] be saved in their sins enough from their
[13:14] sins and yet the Bible is clear Paul
[13:17] said it in Romans 6 what shall we say
[13:20] then shall we continue in sin that grace
[13:22] Miller fruits in the grace of God in the
[13:25] favor of God but he said O God for me
[13:28] every day how shall we that are dead to
[13:30] sin live any longer therein so you know
[13:33] the Bible also said they turned the
[13:35] grace of God into my seriousness which
[13:39] is unbridled lust and and also that site
[13:44] license for sin and so you know that's
[13:48] that is what the gospel has degenerated
[13:51] to but I am convinced that God has to
[13:56] help a bride without spot or wrinkle
[13:58] he's got to have a church if you said
[14:01] I'm going to have a church well he
[14:04] cannot fail he has to do what he said he
[14:07] would do if he's God and we know he's
[14:10] got a man and that church will match the
[14:12] original Church in the book of Acts
[14:14] it'll be a continuation of the book of
[14:16] Acts Luke in the upper room they didn't
[14:18] have to manufacture fire and smoke
[14:20] screen the pillar of fire came in and it
[14:22] was real manufactured it was real and it
[14:25] changed lives and there you see the
[14:27] attraction they come down under the
[14:29] power of the Holy Ghost and with that
[14:31] true attraction one sermon three
[14:33] thousand souls added to the kingdom
[14:35] because it wasn't a manufactured
[14:37] attraction the Bible said in acts 11:15
[14:41] when when Peter went into Cornelius
[14:44] house and he began to preach under them
[14:46] Jesus led by a vision to that house as
[14:48] he began to preach unto them Jesus the
[14:50] Holy Ghost fell upon him and he went
[14:52] back and reported to the Jews they're
[14:54] like what were you doing in a Gentiles
[14:56] house that he began to give the
[14:58] testimony and he picked up an axe 11:15
[15:01] he said and as I began to speak the Holy
[15:03] Ghost fell on them the Gentiles as on us
[15:07] at the beginning and so Peter was
[15:11] signifying that the beginning of the New
[15:13] Testament church took place on the day
[15:15] of Pentecost
[15:16] yes well Jesus said that they were to
[15:19] wait until they were endued with power
[15:21] from on high and that was the place
[15:25] where Jesus poured his spirit out upon
[15:27] the church it was never a church
[15:29] membership for God added to the church
[15:31] daily such as should be saved America it
[15:34] was the power of God that gave birth to
[15:37] the New Testament church the end it must
[15:40] end the same way that it began right
[15:43] absolutely so we've got to come back to
[15:45] the absolute we've got to come back to
[15:47] the author and the finisher of our faith
[15:49] if he was there at the beginning he's
[15:51] got to be here at amen so it's got to be
[15:54] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[15:56] and forever
[15:57] because apart from Jesus you do not even
[16:00] know truth amen
[16:02] unless you hold to his teaching you're
[16:05] not his disciple at all so you know
[16:08] there must be a love for truth or you're
[16:11] gonna be swept away from by the strong
[16:14] delusion that is in the land today you
[16:17] know and the strong delusion comes and
[16:19] it makes truth so like hate because
[16:23] people hate true that's true
[16:25] that is and so you know Isaiah
[16:28] five-and-twenty says woe to them that
[16:31] call evil good and good evil that put
[16:34] darkness for light and light for
[16:36] darkness that put bitter for sweet and
[16:38] sweet for bitter woe to them that are
[16:40] wise in their own eyes and prudent in
[16:42] their own sight so um there again I
[16:46] believe that Jesus today is seeking for
[16:51] worshipers who will worship in sincerity
[16:55] and in truth two things sincere people
[16:59] who are looking for truth
[17:01] and that's what we are about because
[17:04] jesus said if you hold a man teaching
[17:07] then you are really my disciples and
[17:11] then you shall know the truth and the
[17:14] truth shall set you free and so you know
[17:17] every church goer we say today they
[17:20] claim they want to follow Jesus until if
[17:24] they find out where he stays
[17:25] but I believe that God started a church
[17:29] the way he wants and no he wants that
[17:33] survey the way he started and you know
[17:36] in our next session I think it'll be
[17:38] good to down further into this where we
[17:41] can see that that God is still here I
[17:45] live yes in the midst of his people and
[17:47] the same yesterday today you thank you
