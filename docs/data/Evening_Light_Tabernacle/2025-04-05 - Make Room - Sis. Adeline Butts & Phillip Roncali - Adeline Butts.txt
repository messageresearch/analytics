========================================

[Music] A family hiding from the storm found no place at the keeper's door. It was for this a child was born to save a world so cold and hollow. The sleeping town they did not know. Lying in a manger. A savior king who had no home has come to heal our [Music] sorrows. Is there room in your heart? Is there room in your heart? Is there room in your heart for God to write his [Music] story? Shepherds counting sheep at night. Do not fear the glory light. You are preious in his sight. God has come to raise the lonely. Is there room in your heart? Is there room in your heart? Is there room in your heart for God to write his [Music] story? You can come as you are. The may set you aart and you make room in your heart and trade your dreams for his glory. Make room in your heart. Make room your [Music] heart. Mother holds the promise tight. Every wrong will be made right. The road is straight. The burdens light. For in his hands he holds tomorrow. Is there room in your heart? Is there room in your heart? Is there room in your heart for God to write his story? You can come as you are, but it may set you aart when you make room in your heart and train from dreams for [Music] glory. Make room your heart. Make room your heart. Make one your [Music] heart. Make one your heart. [Applause]
