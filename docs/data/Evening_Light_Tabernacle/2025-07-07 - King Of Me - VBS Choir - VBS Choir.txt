========================================

[Music] My God's the king of the giants. My God is the king of the lions. My God's the king of the creatures of the deep. My God the king of me. You heard the story of my friend King David. [Music] Why not let the dark stand in his way cuz he's not there. My God's bigger watching fall. My God is the king of the giants. My God is king of the lions. My God is king of the king of the deep. My God has gone. Have you heard the one about this guy called Daniel? He was a mighty holy praying man. Said thorn to the dead of the scary beast. [Music] But God saved a hero from the lion. My God, king of the giants. My God is the king of lion. My God is king of the grace of the king. My God is the king of me. This is more than history. He will do the same for me. Like Jonah in the whale I see. When I'm lost and afraid, all alone in the dark, you're with me. Oh, you're with me. My God, king of the giant. My God, king of the lions. My God, king of the creatures of the deep. My God is the king of me. My God is the king of the giants. My God is the king of the lions. My God is the king of the creation of the de. My God is the king of me. My God the king of me. [Applause]
