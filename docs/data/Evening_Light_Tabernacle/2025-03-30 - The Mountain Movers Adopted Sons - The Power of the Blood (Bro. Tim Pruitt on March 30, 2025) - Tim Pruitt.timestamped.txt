[10:32] all my fears are gone.
[10:38] I'm no
[10:40] longer a slave to
[10:44] fear. I am a child of
[10:51] God. I'm no longer a slave to
[10:58] fear. I am a child of
[11:04] God. And from my mother's
[11:08] womb, you have chosen
[11:12] me. Your love has called my

[11:45] God. I'm no longer a slave to

[12:00] You split the sea so I could walk right

[12:18] say I am a child of God. You split the
[12:25] sea.

[14:32] before a tyrant throne. They were told
[14:38] that he would spare their lives. if they
[14:43] would
[14:45] renounce the name of Christ. But one by
[14:52] one they chose to die. The son of God

[15:30] honor his command.
[15:33] I pledge
[15:36] allegiance
[15:39] to the
[15:41] lamb, to the lamb of
[15:46] God, who bore my shame, who took my
[15:51] place, who bore my pain. I will sing to
[15:58] honor his command.
[16:02] I pledge al Oh, could we stand this
[16:06] morning and sing it? I pledge
[16:10] aliance. I pledge
[16:14] alce to the
[16:18] lamb. All my strength with all that I
[16:23] am, I will sing to
[16:27] honor his command. I pledge
[16:33] allegiance
[16:36] to the
[16:43] lamb. Let the weak say I am
[16:50] strong. Let the

[17:14] this morning?
[17:17] Is anyone brokenhearted or down this

[18:02] away of the
[18:05] heavens. Mercy
[18:12] s. Oh hosana.

[18:48] song. Jesus Christ has died
[18:54] free.
[18:55] [Applause]

[19:01] lamb that was
[19:04] slain.

[28:01] who is victorious. Amen. We want to
[28:04] remember the ministering brothers that
[28:06] are at the camp this morning. Brother
[28:07] Timothy is up there ministering and
[28:10] different ones that have gone to support
[28:13] the meetings up there. So we just pray
[28:15] that God has been pouring out his
[28:17] blessings to them. Amen. His arm is
[28:19] never too short. He won't forget us here
[28:22] at Evening Light Tabernacle this
[28:23] morning. Ask brother Aaron to come and
[28:25] lead us in prayer this morning. We do
[28:27] have a couple of requests. Um sister
[28:29] Jeanie askked that we pray for uh
[28:32] brother Kenny. Amen. And uh brother
[28:35] Jonathan Middleton writes in a request.
[28:38] He's needing a touch this morning as
[28:40] well.
[28:42] And uh Zach and Zeke and Railen need
[28:46] prayer this morning. They're uh dealing
[28:48] with some asthma conditions, but we know
[28:50] that that's just a devil. Tries to take
[28:53] the things that God made, which is
[28:55] vegetation and pollen and things, and
[28:58] anoint something in ourselves that he
[29:00] thinks, Satan thinks that he's got one
[29:02] over on us. Well, the prophet exposed
[29:04] that and said that's nothing but a
[29:06] devil. So, we'll cast that spirit out
[29:08] and we'll move on. Amen. God bless you
[29:10] this morning. Brother Erin, if you could
[29:12] come, we appreciate
[29:17] it. Let's also remember all those that
[29:20] will be traveling home from that camp
[29:22] today with the storms and things that
[29:23] are expected this evening that Lord,
[29:25] just give them all traveling mercies.
[29:27] Amen. Let's pray together. Heavenly
[29:29] Father, Lord, we're just always so
[29:32] grateful to have another opportunity,
[29:33] Lord, to gather, Lord, not only with
[29:35] your people, but Lord, to gather, Lord,
[29:38] around, Lord, the revealed word of the
[29:40] hour, knowing that you promised, Lord,
[29:42] that you would be in our midst this
[29:44] morning, Lord. So, we already know that
[29:46] this gathering is not in vain, Lord, but
[29:48] we have an opportunity this morning to
[29:50] enter into your courts, Lord, the King
[29:52] of Kings and the Lord of Lords. and we
[29:54] just want to come give you praise, Lord,
[29:56] and elevate your name and lift up your
[29:58] name, Lord, for you are so worthy of it,
[30:00] Father. Lord, you're just so good to us.
[30:02] And we just thank you, Lord, for the way
[30:04] you moved in this place Wednesday night,
[30:06] Lord. The way you've moved at the camp
[30:07] in Oklahoma, Lord. And we are so
[30:09] grateful for those things. And yet,
[30:11] Lord, we've gathered again this morning
[30:13] to receive more of you, Lord. Lord, to
[30:15] see the word of life broke off once
[30:17] again and handed to us and distributed,
[30:19] Lord, in a way that only you can, Lord,
[30:21] to where each person gets the portion
[30:23] that they need, Father. And I I just
[30:25] pray this morning that none of us will
[30:27] be bashful, but we'll step right up and
[30:29] we'll take our portion, Lord. We'll
[30:31] apply it to our lives, Father. Lord, I'm
[30:33] just thanking you, Lord, just knowing
[30:35] what you're going to do and what you've
[30:36] done. And we're just under great
[30:37] expectations, Father, this morning,
[30:40] Lord, that that the word will be
[30:41] revealed to our hearts, Father. And
[30:43] we're we're asking for a special
[30:44] anointing, Lord, not only on the
[30:46] speaker, although that's needed, Father,
[30:48] but we also want an anointing on our
[30:50] ears, Father, that that the word can can
[30:53] work on both ends and take full effect
[30:55] in our lives, Lord, because we don't
[30:56] want to just be guilty, Father, today of
[30:58] just being hearers, but Lord, we want
[31:00] the word to change our lives, Father. We
[31:02] want to be doers of the word this
[31:04] morning, Father. So, we invite you into
[31:06] this place. We ask you to have free
[31:08] reign, Lord. Lord, I pray you would
[31:10] drive out any hindrance, Lord. Any
[31:11] weariness, any worry, anything that
[31:13] would stand before your spirit, move in
[31:15] the way that you would want it to move
[31:17] in this service today, Father. Lord, we
[31:19] just commit all the requests that were
[31:21] read for for Uncle Kenny and brother
[31:23] Jonathan and and Lord, the the the
[31:26] children there dealing with the aszmatic
[31:27] conditions, Father. Lord, as our
[31:29] brothers already said, we know our God
[31:31] reigns over all those things. And we
[31:33] know Lord right now that we can just ask
[31:35] the healing angel of God to begin to
[31:37] move down in those places, in those
[31:39] homes, Lord, through those situations
[31:41] this morning, Lord, and just move in a
[31:43] mighty way. Lord, you're still the
[31:45] healer. We've seen it time after time,
[31:47] Lord. The enemy comes and tries to bring
[31:49] doubt and fear, but Lord, we can look in
[31:51] this very congregation and see miracle
[31:53] after miracle after miracle. And we give
[31:56] you thanks for it this morning. We give
[31:58] you praise, Lord. And we're standing on
[32:00] your word today because your promises
[32:02] are the truth, Father. So we invite you
[32:04] to come and move in our lives, in our
[32:06] hearts, and fulfill your word in our
[32:08] midst today. We pray, Father. Lord, just
[32:10] take control of every aspect of this
[32:12] service, Lord. From the songs, the
[32:14] worship, the ti, the offerings, Lord.
[32:16] May everything go to lift up your
[32:18] kingdom, Lord, and to tear down Satan's
[32:21] kingdom this morning, Father. Lord, I
[32:23] pray for our youth and the the adults
[32:25] and all those that have gathered in
[32:26] Oklahoma. Lord, there'll be many going
[32:28] home to different states and traveling
[32:30] different directions this morning, this
[32:32] evening. Lord, I'm asking that you'll
[32:33] just go before them. Lord, drive back
[32:35] the storms and give them traveling
[32:37] mercies. We pray, Lord, that they can
[32:39] just return safely to their homes. Lord,
[32:41] we'll be careful to give you all the
[32:43] glory for it this morning, Lord. In
[32:44] Jesus name we pray.

[41:15] Hallelujah.
[41:18] Amen. Just before our pastor comes this
[41:20] morning, old favorite song of
[41:23] mine. It's on
[41:26] the singing a song service. long
[41:30] time and I wanted to sing blessed
[41:32] assurance.
[41:35] It's our story.
[41:39] Little did I
[41:40] know, brother Biscoll was sitting in the
[41:43] back. He'd gone through heart
[41:47] surgery. He was thinking of this song
[41:49] over and over. He's like, "Wonder if
[41:52] I'll ever hear that song
[41:54] again." You don't know your days can be
[41:57] numbered.
[41:58] And I came to the pulpit so burdened to
[42:01] sing that song. The man of God wanted to
[42:03] hear it.
[42:05] Maybe somebody's got something in their
[42:07] heart. They're like, "Lord, I just need
[42:09] to hear it from you." He's that kind of
[42:11] God.
[42:14] Exactly what you have need of. You don't
[42:16] have
[42:17] to write a note. You just hold that in
[42:21] your heart. You say, "God,
[42:23] need to hear from you this morning.
[42:25] something special, something
[42:28] personal. He's a God that creates seeds,
[42:32] plants them in the ground, and walks
[42:34] away. Cuz he knows the seed that he has
[42:37] planted will bring forth life. And you
[42:41] just hold that seed in your heart. If
[42:43] he's planted it there, it'll bring forth
[42:45] life. I promise you.
[42:49] Blessed
[42:50] assure
[42:53] us. Jesus is
[42:58] mine. Oh what the
[43:02] foraste of glory
[43:07] divine heir of salvation.
[43:13] Purchase of
[43:16] God, born of his
[43:20] spirit, washed in his
[43:26] blood. This is my
[43:31] story. This is my
[43:35] song. Praising my
[43:39] Savior all the day long.
[43:46] This is my
[43:49] story. This is my song.
[43:54] Praising my
[43:57] savior all the day
[44:00] long. Am I singing it a little different
[44:03] than you're playing it? You have to
[44:05] forgive me.
[44:08] All
[44:09] right. Perfect
[44:13] submission. Perfect
[44:17] delight. Visions of
[44:21] rapure now first on my side.

[44:51] song. Praising my savior.

[45:18] [Music]
[45:19] submission. All is at rest.
[45:24] I in my
[45:27] savior am happy and
[45:31] blessed. Watching and
[45:35] waiting, looking
[45:39] above. I'm filled with his
[45:43] goodness. I'm lost in his
[45:47] love. This is my story.
[45:51] [Music]
[45:52] This is my

[46:19] [Music]
[46:24] Hallelujah. Amen. Isn't God good to us?
[46:27] Amen. As our pastor comes this
[46:32] morning on a
[46:34] hill, far
[46:38] away, stood an
[46:40] old rugged
[46:43] cross. Oh, the
[46:46] emblem of
[46:49] suffering and
[46:52] shame. I love that old cross and I
[46:57] love that old
[46:59] cross. We're the dearest.
[47:04] Oh, just this
[47:06] morning. Oh, it was for
[47:09] me that he was slain.
[47:16] So I'll
[47:18] carry the old rug is
[47:25] wrong till
[47:27] my feet at last.
[47:31] [Music]
[47:37] I will
[47:38] bleed to the
[47:42] [Music]
[47:46] right and
[47:49] exchange something for a crown.
[47:56] [Music]
[48:00] rugged
[48:02] cross
[48:04] so by the
[48:08] word. Oh, it's got a wondrous
[48:12] attraction for
[48:17] me. Oh, the
[48:19] dear lamb of
[48:22] God. He left his
[48:25] glory glory
[48:27] upon to
[48:30] be to
[48:34] [Music]
[48:46] dark till
[48:49] my feet
[48:51] As I lay
[48:54] [Applause]
[48:57] down, I will
[48:59] clean to the old rock in your
[49:05] [Music]
[49:06] arms. I may change it
[49:11] someday
[49:12] [Music]
[49:15] for Amen.
[49:18] Let's just bow our heads together as we
[49:21] go to the Lord for a moment. Father,
[49:24] thou knowest every need, every
[49:26] situation, every
[49:28] problem. Thou knowest our hearts this
[49:31] morning. And we just pray that you'll
[49:34] wash us clean by the blood of the lamb.
[49:38] God, that you would anoint us today by
[49:40] your Holy
[49:41] Spirit. That you take the cold from the
[49:44] altar as it were and press it to our
[49:48] lips and our ears so we can speak and
[49:50] hear what the spirit is saying. And oh
[49:55] God, manifest your glory among us. Bring
[49:59] healing and deliverance to your
[50:01] children. Lord, there are many those
[50:02] that are listening today and joining
[50:06] with us, oh God. And we are the saints,
[50:09] your presence having now invited your
[50:13] presence to come. We ask that the
[50:16] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost would just
[50:18] sweep over this building, meeting every
[50:21] need. We pray in the name of Jesus. Let
[50:24] your glory shine down upon us, Lord,
[50:27] today. Lord, lift us up above the
[50:30] shadows of this world and take us out of
[50:32] the doldrums of life and out the
[50:34] lukewarmness of the age and put a
[50:37] passion in our hearts, a fervent desire
[50:40] to please you, a cry for reaching out in
[50:43] the spirit. We are asking in the name of
[50:46] Jesus that you'll meet the needs of your
[50:48] people today as we worship you. May you
[50:51] speak to us in Jesus' name. Amen. God
[50:54] bless you. Going to let you have your
[50:56] seats right now. Amen. Isn't God good to
[51:00] us to give us so many blessings?
[51:03] And it's undeserving. That's for sure.
[51:06] Amen. But his mercy endures forever.
[51:10] Amen. And I'm thankful for his mercy
[51:12] today. And Amen. I ask God's blessings
[51:14] upon you. May he just speak to you in a
[51:18] in a great way. Today we have something
[51:20] special today. We want to uh announce an
[51:24] engagement for Christopher Hyatt and
[51:27] Kimberly Wear. If they'll just come

[53:44] [Music]
[53:46] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[53:48] together. Let's sing the song. There's
[53:50] power in the blood. Wonder working power
[53:54] in the blood. Glad to have the weeds
[53:56] with us here today. Amen. God bless you.
[53:59] And anyone that's a visitor here, I hope
[54:01] you won't feel that way when you leave
[54:03] that you'll just feel right at home. God
[54:05] bless you. Amen. Amen. There is power,
[54:10] power, wonderful power in the blood.
[54:16] of the
[54:17] lamb. Yes, there is power.
[54:22] Powering power in the precious blood of
[54:27] the
[54:28] lamb will work to be free from the
[54:32] burden of sin. There's power in the
[54:36] blood, power in the blood.
[54:41] You work all of
[54:44] it. There's wonderful power in the
[54:49] blood. Well, there is power, power,
[54:53] wonder working power in the
[54:57] blood of the lamb.
[55:00] There is power. Power one works. Power
[55:06] in the precious blood of the
[55:11] lamb. Would you be free from your
[55:14] passion cry? There's power in the
[55:18] blood. Power in the
[55:21] blood. Come forward.
[55:27] There's wonderful power in the blood. I
[55:31] love it. Well, there is power, power,
[55:35] wonder working power in the
[55:39] blood of the
[55:41] lamb. There is power, power. What works
[55:47] power in the precious blood of the lamb.
[55:53] Would you be wider much wider than snow?
[55:58] There's power in the blood. Power in the
[56:02] blood. Same lost in his
[56:07] life. There's wonderful power in the
[56:11] blood. Power. There is power. Power.
[56:17] Wondering power in the
[56:20] blood. The son of the lamb.
[56:23] Oh, there is power, power, wonder
[56:27] working power in the precious blood of
[56:32] the
[56:32] [Music]
[56:34] lamb.
[56:36] Hallelujah. Amen. Aren't you glad for
[56:38] the the blood of Jesus Christ? It makes
[56:41] us whiter than snow. Amen. And we're
[56:44] going to be speaking about that blood
[56:45] today as we speak on our thought on the
[56:49] mountain movers, the adopted sons. We're
[56:52] going to be speaking on the power of the
[56:55] blood. Amen. God bless you. And turn
[56:58] with me to Revelation 5 and verse 5.
[57:01] We'll read two verses there. Remembering
[57:03] our theme, who art thou, oh great
[57:05] mountain? Thou shalt become a plain and
[57:08] the headstone shall be brought forth
[57:09] with shoutings crying grace, grace unto
[57:14] it. Revelation 5 and verse 5. And one of
[57:17] the elders said unto me, weep not.
[57:20] Behold the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[57:23] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[57:25] the book and to loose the seven seals
[57:28] thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[57:31] midst of the throne, and of the four
[57:33] beasts, and in the midst of the elders
[57:36] stood a lamb as it had been slain,
[57:39] having seven horns and seven eyes, which
[57:42] are the seven spirits of God, sent forth
[57:46] into all the earth. Amen. God bless you.
[57:50] Can be seated. Now, we're going to today
[57:54] as we look at this, we want to take note
[57:58] of the lamb and his work as kinsmen as
[58:01] the lamb who prevailed who wrought
[58:04] victory through through his death. Now,
[58:08] in this vision that we have been looking
[58:10] at for now several times, the lamb is
[58:13] symbolic of Christ's work is our kinsman
[58:16] redeemer.
[58:17] By taking on human flesh, Jesus became
[58:20] one of us.
[58:22] And he was fully God yet he was fully
[58:25] man. He is seen as a lamb who had been
[58:29] slain yet in his death he had prevailed.
[58:33] Now this in itself is a powerful
[58:37] paradox because um normally in a battle
[58:40] the one who dies is the one who loses.
[58:43] But in this battle, the one who died was
[58:46] the one who won.
[58:48] And it was through his death that Jesus
[58:50] descended into hell and he defeated
[58:52] Satan, taking from him the keys of death
[58:55] and of hell. Remember Revelations 1 and
[58:58] 18 says, "I am he that liveth and was
[59:01] dead. And behold, I am alive forever
[59:03] more. Amen. And I have the keys of
[59:06] death, of hell, and of death." Now, he
[59:09] did not suffer defeat. He claimed his
[59:13] ultimate victory. When he rose again, he
[59:16] broke the chains of death. He triumphed
[59:18] over the grave. And in doing so, he
[59:21] conquered sin, sickness, and the curse
[59:24] that had bound humanity. And so, what
[59:27] seemed to be an absolute loss. The
[59:30] crucifixion was actually the greatest
[59:33] triumph in history. Jesus sacrifice on
[59:36] the cross was not the end, but it was
[59:38] the turning point of victory for
[59:41] mankind. Through his death, he overcame
[59:45] the power of sin and the power of death.
[59:48] And by his blood, he provided
[59:51] redemption, restored what was lost in
[59:54] Adam's fall. He broke the chains of sin.
[59:58] And through his resurrection, he proved
[1:00:00] that death does not have its final say.
[1:00:05] Amen. And because of this, all of us who
[1:00:07] have received his Holy Spirit are given
[1:00:10] eternal life and and freedom. And this
[1:00:13] and this is our promise that if the
[1:00:15] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[1:00:19] is living in you that he that raised
[1:00:21] Christ from the dead will also quicken
[1:00:24] your mortal body or give life to your
[1:00:26] mortal body because of his spirit that
[1:00:29] lives in you.
[1:00:32] No longer no longer are we slaves to sin
[1:00:35] and death. For Christ has made us free.
[1:00:39] For the law of the spirit of life in
[1:00:41] Christ Jesus hath made us free from the
[1:00:45] law of sin and death. We remember that
[1:00:48] Paul says that clearly in Romans and he
[1:00:51] and yet we will we ponder what is the
[1:00:54] law of sin and death. It's the natural
[1:00:57] tendency towards sin and the
[1:01:00] consequences of that sin which
[1:01:02] ultimately lead into spiritual death.
[1:01:05] And this law came into effect upon us
[1:01:09] because of the fall. Brother Brandham
[1:01:12] said this about, you know, our own
[1:01:14] fallen human nature. And it just even as
[1:01:17] a child, you know, when and and he says,
[1:01:20] I don't care how good a home a child has
[1:01:23] been brought in and how it's been taught
[1:01:27] to do right if that child has not
[1:01:30] accepted the experience of the new
[1:01:31] birth. Rock and roll. And may I add, uh,
[1:01:34] not just rock and roll music, but all
[1:01:36] worldly attraction catches his attention
[1:01:39] just as quick as he hears it. Because in
[1:01:42] him is born in by nature a carnal
[1:01:46] spirit. And the power of the devil is so
[1:01:48] great today till it catches that spirit
[1:01:50] of that little one. That's why we were
[1:01:53] without hope in the world. Because I'll
[1:01:56] tell you friends, sin had slaved
[1:01:58] humanity. It separated man from God. But
[1:02:02] through the shedding of the blood, Jesus
[1:02:05] bore the punishment for sin and he made
[1:02:08] a way for mankind to be restored to
[1:02:10] righteousness.
[1:02:12] You see the 2 Corinthians 5:21 says God
[1:02:17] made him to be sin who who had no sin to
[1:02:21] be sin for us so that in him we might
[1:02:25] become the righteousness of God. Amen.
[1:02:29] How wonderful is that? Amen. How
[1:02:31] marvelous a truth. You see in the Old
[1:02:34] Testament, the worshipper would lay his
[1:02:36] hands upon his animal, upon his
[1:02:39] sacrifice. And in doing so, he was he
[1:02:42] was symbolically
[1:02:44] uh transferring his sins upon the his
[1:02:49] sacrifice upon the animal. However,
[1:02:52] there could not be a transfer of the
[1:02:54] innocence of that lamb because the
[1:02:57] nature of that lamb could not come back
[1:03:00] upon the worshipper. But how different
[1:03:02] that is in the New Testament when we by
[1:03:05] faith we lay our sins upon Jesus Christ.
[1:03:10] How? by accepting him as our sacrifice.
[1:03:13] And then the nature of that lamb which
[1:03:16] is the Holy Ghost comes upon us
[1:03:19] transferring his innocence, his
[1:03:22] righteousness and his nature upon us.
[1:03:26] How marvelous, how wonderful. By taking
[1:03:29] on human flesh, Jesus fully identified
[1:03:33] with our struggles
[1:03:36] with our temptations, with our
[1:03:37] sufferings, with even our fear of death.
[1:03:40] He He He identified with us. Yet through
[1:03:44] his resurrection, he crushed that fear.
[1:03:47] He freed those that had been held
[1:03:49] captive by it. And his victory is now
[1:03:53] our victory. As he overcame, so will we.
[1:03:57] That same power that raised Jesus from
[1:03:59] the dead now works in those that
[1:04:02] believe. The resurrection is the
[1:04:04] ultimate proof that death, sin, and
[1:04:07] Satan have all been defeated.
[1:04:11] Amen. God's got an unchanging program.
[1:04:15] Whatever God does, he always does it
[1:04:18] that way. God never changes. His program
[1:04:22] is perfect. It was established before
[1:04:24] the foundation of the world. And he
[1:04:26] literally cannot change. He cannot go
[1:04:30] back on his word.
[1:04:32] Amen. For he says, "I am the Lord and I
[1:04:34] change not." But as humans, you know how
[1:04:38] we are. We're a bit fickle. We we we
[1:04:41] make decisions today that we might find
[1:04:43] is wrong tomorrow. We change because we
[1:04:46] are finite. But his first decision on a
[1:04:49] matter is always the right decision. And
[1:04:53] he must act the same way every time that
[1:04:56] that situation arises. If he acted
[1:04:59] differently, it would mean he was wrong
[1:05:01] the first time. And God can never be
[1:05:04] wrong.
[1:05:05] Never. That's right. He's never wrong.
[1:05:09] Therefore, if God ever saved a man,
[1:05:12] under certain conditions, he must save
[1:05:15] every man under the same conditions.
[1:05:19] If he ever healed a man on a certain
[1:05:21] basis, he must heal every man on the
[1:05:24] same basis.
[1:05:26] for this the theme of the message always
[1:05:29] comes out. Jesus Christ the same
[1:05:32] yesterday, today and forever. God simply
[1:05:34] doesn't change his program.
[1:05:37] Amen. He's unchangeable in all his ways.
[1:05:40] And he and and he gives the Holy Spirit
[1:05:43] then to those who repent, who will
[1:05:46] follow his will. And his will we know is
[1:05:49] his word. He doesn't change cuz he
[1:05:51] can't. His decisions are perfect. Amen.
[1:05:55] From the beginning. There's no need for
[1:05:57] him to ever alter them or to change his
[1:06:00] mind because he's sovereign.
[1:06:03] Amen. His word stands forever. I'm
[1:06:06] telling you, you can bank on what he
[1:06:08] said. If he ever was concerned for his
[1:06:11] people, he's still concerned. Amen. His
[1:06:15] motives remain the same. His attitude
[1:06:17] towards sin remains the same. Toward
[1:06:19] righteousness and faith, none of that
[1:06:22] has ever shifted. He's still Jehovah. No
[1:06:25] matter how many will claim otherwise, he
[1:06:29] he is still the same in attitude, the
[1:06:31] same in principle, the same concern.
[1:06:35] Amen. You see, he it's not God that has
[1:06:38] changed. Oh, no. His people who drifted
[1:06:40] away from him. You know, like the rock
[1:06:43] in the wilderness, the rock never left
[1:06:45] them. The Bible said the rock followed
[1:06:46] them. It was always within speaking
[1:06:49] distance. It was Israel who left the
[1:06:52] rock. Amen. But the reason we fail to
[1:06:55] see his mighty works today is not
[1:06:57] because he's not willing,
[1:07:00] but because we don't allow him to move
[1:07:02] in our lives, because he's still the say
[1:07:05] the same God of miracles, the God of
[1:07:08] healing, the God of salvation, just as
[1:07:10] he was 2,000 years ago in the days of
[1:07:14] Jesus Christ. He has to be the same in
[1:07:18] every detail except his corporal body.
[1:07:21] He's not here in the man of of Galilee.
[1:07:23] He's here in your flesh and mine. That's
[1:07:26] his body upon the earth. But his mercy
[1:07:29] and his power is still the same. And it
[1:07:32] was all revealed in Jesus Christ because
[1:07:35] Jesus is the complete revelation of God.
[1:07:39] Now look how he expressed his attitude
[1:07:41] towards sinners. When he when the woman
[1:07:44] was caught in adultery and was brought
[1:07:46] before him, he the only one who could
[1:07:49] condemn her, the only one without sin.
[1:07:53] Come on. He forgave her.
[1:07:57] That's his attitude toward a sinner
[1:07:59] today. Forgiveness.
[1:08:01] He didn't turn away those that were in
[1:08:03] need when the sick came to him. Instead,
[1:08:06] he demonstrated love and power through
[1:08:09] his actions. Amen. He showed his
[1:08:13] compassion, his love, his concern. I'm
[1:08:16] talking about if that's what he was
[1:08:18] then, that's what he is today. If he was
[1:08:21] concerned for humanity and their lost
[1:08:23] condition, then he's concerned for every
[1:08:26] sinner today.
[1:08:28] God so loved the world.
[1:08:33] He's not willing that any should perish,
[1:08:36] but that all would come to life.
[1:08:39] So as we have said Jesus Christ is the
[1:08:41] same yesterday, today and forever. That
[1:08:44] means his power, his principles, his
[1:08:47] compassion remains unchanged.
[1:08:50] The same Jesus that healed the blind,
[1:08:54] raised the dead, cast out demons, is the
[1:08:57] same Jesus who works and lives today in
[1:09:00] lives of believers.
[1:09:03] Amen. Listen, I mean it's he's here
[1:09:07] today in the form of his Holy Spirit.
[1:09:10] And so the attitude of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:12] toward the sick is to heal them.
[1:09:15] Amen. His attitude toward the lost is to
[1:09:17] save them. He's unchanging.
[1:09:21] Amen. He cannot change. Now again, you
[1:09:25] see, he he God must always remain
[1:09:30] consistent in his dealings with with
[1:09:32] man. He healed. If he healed before, he
[1:09:35] heals now. If he saved before, he saves
[1:09:39] now. Amen. Otherwise, he would have made
[1:09:42] a mistake the first time. And that's
[1:09:44] impossible. God is perfect in all his
[1:09:46] ways. The Bible said he is the rock. His
[1:09:50] works are perfect. All his ways are
[1:09:52] just. He's a faithful God who does no
[1:09:55] wrong. He's upright and just is he.
[1:10:00] That's the God we serve. Yes, sir.
[1:10:03] So why don't we see his power so often?
[1:10:08] Why don't we see it? It's because the
[1:10:11] church has settled for less
[1:10:15] than what God has promised.
[1:10:18] Instead of stepping forward in faith, we
[1:10:21] hesitate. We doubt. But I want to say
[1:10:24] the word remains true. If you abide in
[1:10:26] me and my words abide in you, then ask
[1:10:29] whatever you will and it'll be done for
[1:10:31] you. The word has not changed. It is
[1:10:34] people's attitude toward the word and
[1:10:36] toward the promise that is changed.
[1:10:40] Now, he's the only door. He's the only
[1:10:43] way. He's the only door to heaven. There
[1:10:46] is no other way. No other name, no other
[1:10:50] path, no no other means of access
[1:10:53] through him. And of course, we know then
[1:10:56] that faith is the key that unlocks that
[1:10:59] door. Amen. Amen. So if Jesus is a door
[1:11:04] to every promise, then his then faith in
[1:11:07] his finished work grants us access to
[1:11:11] every treasure of the kingdom of God.
[1:11:15] every promise that he has made, if it's
[1:11:17] salvation, if it's healing, if it's
[1:11:20] deliverance, if it's peace, if it's
[1:11:22] power, it's all unlocked by faith.
[1:11:27] And faith isn't a passive belief. It's a
[1:11:30] force that holds God's word. Amen.
[1:11:36] You know, no matter how great the key is
[1:11:39] and how accurate it is and how it will
[1:11:42] turn the little levers in the lock, it
[1:11:45] takes a hand to turn it.
[1:11:49] And that hand, my brother, sister, is
[1:11:52] faith. That's right. It's the only thing
[1:11:54] that will unlock the the treasures
[1:11:57] behind the door. And that door is Jesus.
[1:12:00] Your only access to Jesus is by faith.
[1:12:02] That's right. You must believe. Yes sir.
[1:12:06] All things are possible to them that
[1:12:09] believe. Amen. So faith is not just a
[1:12:12] passion belief is a force. And the
[1:12:15] moment faith is exercised, the door
[1:12:18] swings open. Amen. What was once
[1:12:20] impossible then becomes possible. You
[1:12:24] know, no wonder the the scripture
[1:12:25] declares the just shall live by faith.
[1:12:31] Amen. Because without faith the door
[1:12:34] remains closed. But to all those that
[1:12:37] believe all things are possible.
[1:12:43] Faith is not
[1:12:45] optional. It is vital to the church.
[1:12:49] Brother Brandham even would preach in
[1:12:51] some of his latter sermons on perfect
[1:12:53] faith. A people with perfect faith that
[1:12:56] brings them into a rapturing condition.
[1:12:59] It it's it's the only approach to God.
[1:13:02] You see, unbelief and doubt are the
[1:13:05] enemies to faith. The very forces that
[1:13:08] led to humanity's fall. You see, if
[1:13:12] unbelief was the separation, then faith
[1:13:15] is the bridge that brings us back to
[1:13:18] restoration.
[1:13:20] So everything we receive from God must
[1:13:23] come by faith. There is no other way.
[1:13:28] Amen. That's right.
[1:13:30] He that comes to God, the Bible said,
[1:13:33] must believe that he is. This is Hebrews
[1:13:35] 11:6. And that he is a rewarder of those
[1:13:38] that diligently seek him. That's right.
[1:13:41] Now, notice he they must believe that he
[1:13:43] is, not he was.
[1:13:47] He did it yesterday, but not today.
[1:13:51] Amen. You see that? but that he is a
[1:13:55] living, present, active God. And without
[1:13:59] faith, it's impossible for you to please
[1:14:02] him.
[1:14:05] So those who waver between doubt and and
[1:14:09] and belief are double-minded. They're
[1:14:12] unstable in all their ways. And such a
[1:14:15] person cannot even expect to receive
[1:14:18] anything from God because you faith has
[1:14:20] to stand firm. It has to be unwavering.
[1:14:23] It has to be fully persuaded that
[1:14:26] whatever God has spoken, he will bring
[1:14:29] it to pass.
[1:14:33] It is faith that lifts you up into God's
[1:14:35] presence. Amen. Come on. Amen. It's
[1:14:40] doubt that keeps you bound, hesitant,
[1:14:42] afraid. So, we need to cast aside all
[1:14:45] unbelief and step into the full
[1:14:48] assurance of God's great promise. For
[1:14:51] the just shall live by faith.
[1:14:54] Oh, I want to bring this forward from
[1:14:56] last Sunday. And and and by the way, if
[1:14:58] you want to write down for references,
[1:15:00] you can go back to the two sermons on
[1:15:02] God and simplicity because I'm going to
[1:15:05] be I'm going to be using things from
[1:15:08] there and and also the fun fundamental
[1:15:10] foundation for faith. And uh so you'll
[1:15:14] find these truths there. But I I I spoke
[1:15:16] about this last Sunday, but I want to
[1:15:17] bring it forward again. I want to make
[1:15:20] it a part of this sermon. I want to I
[1:15:22] want you to just breathe in these words
[1:15:25] and let it take a root in your soul.
[1:15:28] Faith does not come by fasting. I'm
[1:15:32] getting this fun the fundamental
[1:15:35] foundation for faith. Faith does not
[1:15:37] come by fasting. Faith does not come by
[1:15:41] praying.
[1:15:43] Faith does not come by reading a book.
[1:15:46] Now fasting is good. Of course, praying
[1:15:49] is good, reading is good, but those
[1:15:51] things alone do not create faith. Faith
[1:15:54] is a deep settled in a certainty in the
[1:15:58] heart. It is unshakable knowing, a
[1:16:02] divine assurance that what God has said
[1:16:05] is already done.
[1:16:09] You know, sometimes we are saying, "I'm
[1:16:11] going to be healed." No, it's already
[1:16:13] done. I'm going to be saved. No, it's
[1:16:15] already done. Amen. You see, it is a
[1:16:18] finished work. It's already done. It's
[1:16:22] already paid for.
[1:16:25] It's already yours.
[1:16:28] So, you see, it is an unshakable
[1:16:31] knowing, a divine assurance that what
[1:16:34] God said is already done.
[1:16:39] Not it is going to be, but it's already
[1:16:42] done.
[1:16:45] Now, it is as natural as breathing.
[1:16:50] Amen. It's as unconscious as walking to
[1:16:53] your car. How many times have you heard
[1:16:55] Brother Brandham say, "Faith is an
[1:16:57] unconscious thing."
[1:16:59] It's as unconscious as walking to your
[1:17:01] car and turning the key and driving home
[1:17:04] because you already know you can.
[1:17:07] You don't analyze it. You don't question
[1:17:09] it. You just do it. Amen.
[1:17:12] Amen. Now, that's how faith is meant to
[1:17:14] work in the believer's life. The reason
[1:17:16] we struggle is because we have not yet
[1:17:19] become fully accustomed to the laws of
[1:17:22] the spirit as we have to the laws of the
[1:17:24] natural. Amen. Amen. But when the
[1:17:27] church, when you fully grasp God's laws
[1:17:32] of healing and his power and his
[1:17:35] deliverance and that they're just as
[1:17:38] real and and as active as as gravity
[1:17:41] itself,
[1:17:43] there'll be no stopping to the
[1:17:44] outpouring of his spirit. Amen. It'll
[1:17:47] flow unhindered. You see, we must come
[1:17:50] to a place of absolute conviction.
[1:17:54] A place where doubt is no longer
[1:17:56] entertained.
[1:17:58] A place where miracles are no longer
[1:18:01] unexpected.
[1:18:03] I'm talking about a super church. I'm
[1:18:06] talking about a super race. A place
[1:18:09] where faith operates like a second
[1:18:11] nature. Amen. And let me tell you, we
[1:18:14] are in that hour.
[1:18:17] We are that people who have been called
[1:18:19] to walk in faith, perfect faith.
[1:18:23] Come on. We have been called out of
[1:18:26] doubt,
[1:18:27] unbelief, confusion.
[1:18:30] Come on. Well, what do you think you
[1:18:32] heard the call? Come out of her, my
[1:18:34] people. What was it calling you out of
[1:18:36] confusion? Babylon.
[1:18:40] Amen. Calling you out of doubt,
[1:18:43] unbelief, shadows that have been placed
[1:18:45] over the word of God. bringing your
[1:18:47] faith settled securely securely on the
[1:18:51] word of God. Let me tell you, somebody's
[1:18:54] got to be the Enoch in this day and walk
[1:18:56] with God up the king's highway
[1:19:01] and take their position of sunship in
[1:19:03] the heavens.
[1:19:08] Now, we were never meant to be powerless
[1:19:11] and weak. Amen. And if we could just
[1:19:14] clear the channel and we could just
[1:19:16] sweep away man-made doctrines and fear
[1:19:18] and doubt and religious formalities
[1:19:22] and fully surrender to the will of God.
[1:19:24] Let this word, this message really take
[1:19:27] root in your heart. Then you'd see the
[1:19:29] church explode and into its supernatural
[1:19:33] function. You'd see it doing the works
[1:19:36] of God, becoming that invisible army.
[1:19:39] But when we're afraid, when we're in
[1:19:41] doubt, when we're in fear and we're
[1:19:43] drawing back, the Bible say, "If any man
[1:19:45] draw back, I my soul has no pleasure in
[1:19:48] him."
[1:19:50] God's pleasure is only found when people
[1:19:53] are progressing forward and reaching
[1:19:55] higher heights and digging deeper.
[1:19:59] We were not called and created to live
[1:20:02] beneath our calling and beneath our
[1:20:05] privileges.
[1:20:06] We were born again to reign, to have
[1:20:10] dominion,
[1:20:12] Amen. I, you know, I I can't get over
[1:20:14] how many people think that they have the
[1:20:17] Holy Ghost and they're still slaves to
[1:20:19] pornography
[1:20:21] or or illicit sex sins or alcohol or
[1:20:24] cigarettes. You cannot you cannot be uh
[1:20:28] slave to that. You have been set free.
[1:20:31] You see, when when we were born to
[1:20:33] reign, to have dominion, Amen. Amen.
[1:20:36] Amen. To to live a holy life.
[1:20:40] We're new creation in Christ. We're
[1:20:42] designed to control to to rule to bring
[1:20:46] praise to the almighty God. And you
[1:20:48] can't bring praise to him. And your
[1:20:50] life's still in the dregery of sin.
[1:20:53] That's right.
[1:20:56] We got to die to ourselves. And to do
[1:20:58] this, we got to let go of our own
[1:21:00] limited understanding, our our little
[1:21:03] bitty human thoughts.
[1:21:06] Because our little human thoughts thinks
[1:21:08] it's impossible. It cannot happen. I
[1:21:11] can't do it. I I'll never make it. I I
[1:21:14] can never be what I should be. That's
[1:21:16] your little human thought. Step off of
[1:21:18] that to the mind of Christ. I can do all
[1:21:21] things through Christ which strengthens
[1:21:23] me. I can be an overcomer in this evil
[1:21:26] age. I can rise above the sins, the
[1:21:29] problems of this age. I can be an
[1:21:32] overcomer. I can be victorious. He made
[1:21:35] a people to be victorious
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:38] to walk in victory. That's right.
[1:21:46] We must create lean on the
[1:21:48] smallmindedness of human understanding.
[1:21:51] Learn to lean on the mind of Christ. You
[1:21:54] get the mind of Christ by the baptism of
[1:21:56] the Holy Ghost. That's how you get it.
[1:21:59] That's right. Then you have his thinking
[1:22:01] because you have his nature. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:05] So you see we but we when when that
[1:22:08] happens then then you think like Jesus
[1:22:11] does
[1:22:13] and when that happens
[1:22:15] impossibilities all become possible.
[1:22:18] Amen. So we have to abandon our will for
[1:22:22] his will. lose our control completely
[1:22:26] over to him. Amen. And then the same
[1:22:29] power that operated through Jesus would
[1:22:32] flow through us just as naturally as
[1:22:34] breathing. And miracles would no longer
[1:22:36] be rare,
[1:22:38] but they would be expected.
[1:22:41] Wouldn't you like to be a part of that
[1:22:42] kind of a church? Amen. Where where
[1:22:45] healing would not be occasional,
[1:22:48] but it would be continual. It would be
[1:22:51] what we expect.
[1:22:53] Amen. Until even we expected so great
[1:22:57] until even our bodies would be changed
[1:23:01] and glorified
[1:23:08] where we would be operating in the
[1:23:09] dominion of the spirit instead of
[1:23:11] struggling in the flesh.
[1:23:14] A lot of it talks a lot of us talk about
[1:23:16] our struggle in the flesh.
[1:23:19] We hear a lot of preaching about
[1:23:21] that. Friends, I want you to know you
[1:23:25] are to overcome by the spirit.
[1:23:28] Amen. When man sinned from the
[1:23:31] beginning, listen, he started out wrong.
[1:23:34] He sought his own way
[1:23:36] back. He did wrong. He sinned and he
[1:23:39] tried to hide it. They tried to cover
[1:23:42] themselves with fig leaves, but it was
[1:23:44] insufficient.
[1:23:46] That's right. Amen. But God made a way
[1:23:48] and that involved the shedding of
[1:23:51] innocent blood and he killed an animal
[1:23:54] and he clothed them with skins.
[1:23:57] And this act established a principle
[1:23:59] that I don't want you to miss that the
[1:24:02] only way, let me say it again, the only
[1:24:04] way to be reconciled to God is under the
[1:24:07] shed blood of an innocent substitute.
[1:24:13] That's the only remedy for sin today.
[1:24:15] Amen. You say, "Oh, brother Tim, we
[1:24:17] believe he's ought the mercy seat." I
[1:24:19] say, "Shame on you." Because you have
[1:24:22] cut off, you have cut off the approach
[1:24:24] to God.
[1:24:27] You have cut off the way to forgiveness.
[1:24:30] You have cut off from people the blood
[1:24:33] of Jesus Christ because his blood is
[1:24:35] what intercedes between God and man.
[1:24:39] Now you see from the from from the
[1:24:42] moment that moment on of where he
[1:24:45] established this principle of the shed
[1:24:47] blood God never met man any other way.
[1:24:53] Amen. Abel by revelation he understood
[1:24:56] this. He realized when he offered a lamb
[1:24:59] by faith and God accepted it that that
[1:25:03] this would this was what God did and
[1:25:07] this was what God would accept. He saw
[1:25:09] what covered God man's sin and brought
[1:25:12] an audience with God before was the
[1:25:14] death of an animal or taking of a
[1:25:17] substitute. Amen. And so he comes and
[1:25:20] offered to the same thing. And he
[1:25:22] realized the only way to be reconciled
[1:25:25] to God is under the shed blood.
[1:25:28] And so by revelation, he offered a lamb.
[1:25:33] And that principle was established. And
[1:25:36] it continued through all the days of
[1:25:38] Israel.
[1:25:41] They were only able to meet God under
[1:25:43] the blood of the lamb. There was no
[1:25:45] other place to meet him. Amen.
[1:25:49] All you have to do is listen to a sermon
[1:25:51] called God's chosen place of worship.
[1:25:53] And brother Brandham establishes this
[1:25:55] truth. You know, there again, only one
[1:25:58] place God will meet a man.
[1:26:02] Amen. And that's under the blood. That's
[1:26:04] right. And today, the only way to meet
[1:26:06] God is through the blood. Not through an
[1:26:08] organization, not through good works,
[1:26:10] not through traditions, but through the
[1:26:12] blood of the lamb. With without the
[1:26:14] shedding of blood, there is no remission
[1:26:17] of sin. Amen. And when Jesus ascended,
[1:26:21] think about it. He didn't leave some
[1:26:23] kind of physical relic, a piece of the
[1:26:26] cross or a nail of his robe or or nail
[1:26:30] or his robe or something like that. He
[1:26:32] left
[1:26:33] us. He left us something greater than
[1:26:36] that. Oh, he didn't even leave us a vial
[1:26:38] of his blood so that we could just reach
[1:26:41] down and chips every person down to be
[1:26:43] saved and get them under the blood. No,
[1:26:46] sir. He didn't do that. What did he
[1:26:48] leave us? The Holy Spirit.
[1:26:51] The life that was in the blood. He left
[1:26:54] the Holy Spirit. He sent that back to
[1:26:56] the church. You see, that's why the
[1:26:59] bride or the church is the blood, not
[1:27:02] the spirit.
[1:27:04] Because you can only be born again by
[1:27:07] the spirit of God, which is the blood of
[1:27:09] God.
[1:27:10] Amen. Now again, he he said it, "Behold,
[1:27:15] I send you the promise of my father upon
[1:27:17] you, but tear you in the city of
[1:27:19] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:27:22] from on high." Don't do anything.
[1:27:25] Don't preach. Don't go try to heal the
[1:27:27] sick. Don't do anything until you come
[1:27:29] under the blood.
[1:27:32] Amen. That's right. Amen. Yes.
[1:27:35] You see, when he commissioned his
[1:27:38] disciples before his before Calvary and
[1:27:41] to heal the sick and cast out devils, he
[1:27:44] did it because of his personal presence
[1:27:46] being there. Amen. And they went forth
[1:27:49] in his power in his name.
[1:27:52] But friends, when he left and he went
[1:27:55] away, he was not here physically
[1:27:58] to back up those words and promises.
[1:28:02] Come on. But so what did he do? He sent
[1:28:04] back the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:07] Amen. To do what? To back up his words
[1:28:10] and promises. And when Jesus died at
[1:28:13] Calvary, he commended his spirit to the
[1:28:15] father. And on the day of Pentecost,
[1:28:17] that same spirit returned to the church.
[1:28:20] And the Holy Spirit is the life of the
[1:28:22] blood that is given to the believers as
[1:28:25] a seal, a comforter, a guide until the
[1:28:28] day of redemption the day he comes for
[1:28:31] us. Amen.
[1:28:34] But man has always been trying to find
[1:28:36] another approach to God through his own
[1:28:38] means. They'll try religion or
[1:28:40] philosophy or traditions or human
[1:28:43] efforts. And that's why men are even
[1:28:45] trying today even in the preachers in
[1:28:47] the message trying psychology and it
[1:28:50] won't work
[1:28:53] because God don't change his way of
[1:28:55] approach.
[1:28:57] He only meets man under the blood. The
[1:29:00] only way to deal with sin's problem is
[1:29:02] the blood.
[1:29:05] Amen.
[1:29:07] Now, Israel could only worship under the
[1:29:09] shed blood today and make denominations,
[1:29:12] organizations, scientific achievements
[1:29:15] to create unity and a fellowship with
[1:29:17] God. But they've all failed. Every one
[1:29:19] of them. Amen. cuz there's only one
[1:29:22] place where God will meet a man and each
[1:29:26] and with true unity and that's under the
[1:29:29] cross. For the Bible said there is but
[1:29:31] one God and one mediator between God and
[1:29:34] man and that's the man Christ Jesus.
[1:29:39] Amen.
[1:29:41] Now,
[1:29:43] so of course we live in a scientific
[1:29:46] age.
[1:29:48] Everybody wants to run and
[1:29:51] assimilate God through their limited
[1:29:55] abilities of the peanut brain of a human
[1:29:59] being.
[1:30:01] But you can never scientifically prove
[1:30:04] God.
[1:30:06] He must be accepted by faith.
[1:30:11] Amen. Because as we've quoted already,
[1:30:14] it's impossible to please him without
[1:30:16] faith. He rewards those that comes to
[1:30:18] him in faith that believes that he is.
[1:30:22] And when you look at the the the
[1:30:24] Christian
[1:30:25] armor, they it's all supernatural. For
[1:30:29] he says we walk by faith and not by
[1:30:32] sight.
[1:30:34] So look at that. Look at the armor of of
[1:30:36] God. Love, joy, peace, faith, patience,
[1:30:39] meekness, gentleness. These things
[1:30:42] cannot be bought
[1:30:45] or can neither can they be proven
[1:30:47] scientifically.
[1:30:50] They are all supernatural.
[1:30:54] You can't buy love.
[1:30:56] It's supernatural.
[1:30:58] You can't buy peace, it's supernatural.
[1:31:02] Come on. It's all supernatural.
[1:31:03] Everything that that comes from God is
[1:31:06] supernatural. You know, and your battle
[1:31:08] is not a flesh and blood battle. That's
[1:31:10] right. But we are in a a spiritual
[1:31:13] battle. And just like nations have spies
[1:31:17] to uncover other military strategies.
[1:31:21] You know, Satan seeks to expose weakness
[1:31:25] in believers.
[1:31:27] You see, you see, he's doing everything.
[1:31:29] And we're wrestling not against flesh
[1:31:31] and blood, but against principalities,
[1:31:33] against powers, against rulers of
[1:31:36] darkness.
[1:31:38] We're being attacked. Your faith is
[1:31:40] being attacked.
[1:31:42] You see, God knowing this battle would
[1:31:44] come, he provided the proper armor for
[1:31:49] his children. Salvation is our helmet,
[1:31:52] faith is our shield, and the word of God
[1:31:55] is our sword.
[1:31:58] And he fortified his children all the
[1:32:00] way from Eden
[1:32:02] behind the protective word of God.
[1:32:06] And and we must take the whole word of
[1:32:09] God and use it because every part of it
[1:32:12] is needed. The Bible said again, "Man
[1:32:14] must live by every word." Amen. That
[1:32:18] proceedth out of the mouth of God.
[1:32:21] Amen. Man must live. This the only way
[1:32:25] to live is by every word.
[1:32:31] Hallelujah. You can tell whether
[1:32:32] people's got life or not. Because if you
[1:32:35] really got the Holy Ghost, you're going
[1:32:37] to believe all every word.
[1:32:39] You're going to live by that word.
[1:32:42] Amen. Because man shall live by every
[1:32:45] word. Just as a just shall live by
[1:32:48] faith. Amen. Man shall live by every
[1:32:51] word
[1:32:53] that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[1:32:55] So there's real danger in doubting God's
[1:32:59] word.
[1:33:00] real danger. The word must be believed.
[1:33:04] Look, look at the theme of brother
[1:33:06] Brandhamson in the Christ, the mystery
[1:33:08] of God revealed. He says, "When he can
[1:33:11] get preeminence in a man, he can take
[1:33:15] them back to Eden." That's right. Amen.
[1:33:20] When his word can have preeminence.
[1:33:23] Well, that's true even in salvation.
[1:33:25] When you give his word preeminence
[1:33:28] through repentance and baptism in his
[1:33:30] name and fully obeying the word of God
[1:33:33] there, it entitles you to the token for
[1:33:37] Eden to come down in your life for
[1:33:39] heaven to descend and come within you.
[1:33:42] That's right. Amen. That's where God
[1:33:44] wants heaven. Not just up there, but in
[1:33:46] here.
[1:33:51] But that one doubt, that one
[1:33:55] question lured Eve away from the
[1:33:58] fortress of God's word and sin entered
[1:34:00] into the world. And that's exactly how
[1:34:03] the how the that Satan attacks the
[1:34:06] church today. Introducing just a tiny
[1:34:09] bit of doubt.
[1:34:12] If he can get you to question one word,
[1:34:15] he's already won the battle.
[1:34:20] There is no safety in churches. That's
[1:34:23] right. Not even here.
[1:34:26] Amen. No safety in in organizations or
[1:34:29] religious experiences. The only security
[1:34:32] is by believing and acting on God's
[1:34:35] entire word. That's right. As the Bible
[1:34:38] said in Proverbs, every word of God is
[1:34:40] pure. The word is a shield to them that
[1:34:44] put their trust in him.
[1:34:48] So, we must stay behind the word. It's
[1:34:50] important to never leave the word. Hey,
[1:34:53] in your battles, don't leave the word in
[1:34:57] your temptations. Don't leave the word.
[1:35:00] When you are are approaching God for
[1:35:02] healing, don't leave the word. Right.
[1:35:05] Amen.
[1:35:06] Keep confessing what the word said.
[1:35:12] Amen. So, we must stay behind the word.
[1:35:14] That's always been God's program from
[1:35:16] the Garden of Eden to today. If we
[1:35:19] accept God's word is absolute truth and
[1:35:23] approach him in faith, he will answer
[1:35:26] because he said, "Knock and it shall be
[1:35:29] open to you. Ask and it shall be given.
[1:35:33] Seek and you shall find.
[1:35:38] Now, he is the only way, as we've said,
[1:35:42] to God. I am the way, the truth, and the
[1:35:46] life. There's not a dozen ways to God.
[1:35:50] There's not there's not one, you know,
[1:35:52] you know, if you're Muhammad and that's
[1:35:53] the way, and you're Buddhist, that's the
[1:35:55] way. No, there's only one way.
[1:36:01] and and he said, "No one can come to the
[1:36:04] father except by me."
[1:36:08] So, he's our approach to God. And he
[1:36:11] wasn't just a prophet or a good man. He
[1:36:14] was God in the flesh.
[1:36:16] For it says, "In the beginning was the
[1:36:18] word, and the word was with God, and the
[1:36:20] word was God." And the word was made
[1:36:23] flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:36:26] Amen.
[1:36:28] But before before man's fall into sin,
[1:36:32] he was a son of God. He was an offspring
[1:36:35] of God. He was an inheritor of the
[1:36:37] earth. He had dominion and and he could
[1:36:40] he could speak and and he could actually
[1:36:43] speak things to in existence. He
[1:36:46] reflected the very creative nature of
[1:36:50] the father. That's right. But Adam lost
[1:36:53] his inheritance to the earth and to his
[1:36:56] right to eternal life. That's what this
[1:36:59] question book
[1:37:01] represents.
[1:37:02] And notice
[1:37:05] his Satan then becomes this quarter upon
[1:37:08] the earth because he is the one who
[1:37:10] surrendered to it. But he couldn't take
[1:37:13] the book. He was not worthy. So it went
[1:37:17] in the hands of God until a worthy man
[1:37:20] could come. Amen. And Adam, what he did
[1:37:23] was exchange his faith in God for
[1:37:26] Satan's reasoning, didn't he? Amen. As a
[1:37:29] result, he forfeited his eternal life.
[1:37:33] He forfeited his right to the tree of
[1:37:35] life, his dominion over the earth. Yeah,
[1:37:38] he transferred everything, including you
[1:37:42] and me,
[1:37:44] all of his offspring,
[1:37:47] into the hands of Satan,
[1:37:50] and you would be born in sin,
[1:37:54] shaped by iniquity,
[1:37:57] speaking lies,
[1:38:01] when man sinned in Eden, he lost
[1:38:04] everything.
[1:38:06] He lost
[1:38:08] sunship. He became a sinner by
[1:38:11] nature. He fell, became a slave to sin.
[1:38:15] He come under the grip and dominion of
[1:38:19] Satan. He separated himself from God and
[1:38:23] he crossed a great chasm, entered into
[1:38:26] death and could never return on his
[1:38:30] own. But then God in his mercy Oh my.
[1:38:35] Amen. Here, even before Calvary, he
[1:38:39] accepted a innocent substitute, a lamb,
[1:38:43] a goat or sheep, and he shed his blood
[1:38:46] as a cover for sin.
[1:38:49] And just as Abel is spoken of on the
[1:38:51] other side of the chasm, first with
[1:38:53] animals, then ultimately with his own
[1:38:55] son, the blood of bulls and goats, it
[1:38:58] could only cover sin. But the blood of
[1:39:00] Jesus Christ remits sin. Amen.
[1:39:04] Now, I'm going to go going to the the
[1:39:06] things that Brother Brandham taught us
[1:39:08] in God's simplicity. And he talked about
[1:39:12] if a red
[1:39:13] stain is covered with white, the stain
[1:39:17] remains. That's right. But God sent a
[1:39:21] true cleansing agent from heaven, the
[1:39:23] blood of his son. Yeah. And when our
[1:39:26] confessed sins are dipped into God's
[1:39:29] bleach, they disappear forever.
[1:39:34] That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:39:37] Amen. Do you realize where that places
[1:39:39] you as a son perfectly sinless
[1:39:44] before God?
[1:39:46] Wonderful.
[1:39:48] Oh, if you can just get a real
[1:39:50] revelation of justification
[1:39:53] and by faith believe it, receive it for
[1:39:55] yourself. How many Christians today are
[1:39:58] still walking in condemnation
[1:40:03] looking at their past
[1:40:05] and thinking that that's going to
[1:40:07] control their future, right? Amen. Your
[1:40:10] past has been been plunged in the bleach
[1:40:13] of the blood of Jesus Christ and they're
[1:40:17] everyone of God gone
[1:40:19] never to be remembered again.
[1:40:22] Wonderful. Now, brother Brandham in his
[1:40:24] sermon there in God and simplicity he
[1:40:26] took for an example a simple drop of
[1:40:29] ink. Now, I used a little research to
[1:40:32] come up with this because really I've
[1:40:34] got a limited knowledge of chemistry.
[1:40:37] So, I just kind of I just had to do a
[1:40:40] little research here to be able to
[1:40:42] formulate this into words and hopefully
[1:40:44] you'll grasp the principle today. So,
[1:40:47] it's as brother Brandham said, it starts
[1:40:50] with a little drop of
[1:40:52] ink. But what is ink? Ink is made up of
[1:40:56] chemicals.
[1:40:57] Well, let's break that down. Where did
[1:40:59] that come from? Well, you say, well, it
[1:41:02] contains water. Water is H2O and and
[1:41:05] that's a fundamental component, but
[1:41:07] that's just a part of it. Ink also has
[1:41:10] color. But where does that color come
[1:41:12] from? We know that white light is the
[1:41:16] origin of all colors. Every hue is
[1:41:19] derived from it. White light is
[1:41:21] considered to be composed of all the
[1:41:23] colors of the visible spectrum. Meaning
[1:41:26] it can be seen as the origin or
[1:41:29] combination of all colors.
[1:41:33] Every color of the rainbow, red, orange,
[1:41:36] yellow, blue, green, indigo, violet, is
[1:41:39] all in the light. Yes, sir. Amen. Many
[1:41:42] of you have seen this done, you know, in
[1:41:44] a classroom when a light is shown
[1:41:45] through a prism. It it fractures the
[1:41:47] light and shows all the colors that's in
[1:41:50] that white light.
[1:41:53] So now then, how did this specific black
[1:41:56] ink come to be? Well, let's trace it
[1:41:58] further. The color and ink comes from
[1:42:02] pigments or dyes which are chemical
[1:42:05] compounds. And these compounds originate
[1:42:08] from molecular
[1:42:10] structures formed by by by elements
[1:42:14] interacting in precise ways.
[1:42:19] I need your glasses just a
[1:42:23] minute. You can tell this ain't brother
[1:42:25] Tim right here.
[1:42:28] I got this egghe head
[1:42:31] business from what I researched.
[1:42:35] So this ain't
[1:42:36] me. But let me just try to break it down
[1:42:39] for you. I'm trying to get your
[1:42:40] attention.
[1:42:42] So let's talk about it for a moment. At
[1:42:44] a deeper level, these molecules consist
[1:42:46] of atoms arranged in specific patterns.
[1:42:50] Right? If a certain set of atoms had
[1:42:54] combined differently, let's say one atom
[1:42:57] more or less, the color might have been
[1:42:59] different. That's right. So what
[1:43:01] determined
[1:43:02] that? Everything follows a structure and
[1:43:05] order. The chemical properties, the
[1:43:07] molecular interactions, and even the
[1:43:10] existence of matter itself. None of it
[1:43:12] happens by chance.
[1:43:15] If ink is a creation, it must have come
[1:43:18] from somewhere.
[1:43:20] A creation points to a creator.
[1:43:30] Now, all of my smartness is
[1:43:33] gone. My chemistry lesson is over. But I
[1:43:37] want you to get it. Our sins were as
[1:43:40] black as that ink. That's right.
[1:43:43] Hallelujah. But dropped into a basin of
[1:43:46] pure bleach. What happens to that ink?
[1:43:49] It dissolves it completely.
[1:43:52] It appears without disappears without a
[1:43:55] trace left of it. There's no fumes.
[1:43:58] There's no residue of it. There's no
[1:44:00] nothing. It's gone forever.
[1:44:03] You can't call it back.
[1:44:06] Amen. It's returned to its original
[1:44:09] state as though it never existed.
[1:44:14] And that, my friends, is exactly what
[1:44:17] the blood does to sin. It fractures it.
[1:44:21] It divides it. It dispels it. It goes
[1:44:24] down through the chains of the molecular
[1:44:26] structure until it is no more.
[1:44:30] Hallelujah. Though your sins be as
[1:44:32] scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[1:44:35] And though they be red like crimson,
[1:44:38] they shall be as wool.
[1:44:43] Confess your sins. You plunging them
[1:44:45] into the blood of Jesus. They're not
[1:44:48] just covered. They're completely
[1:44:51] annihilated.
[1:44:54] The blood does not hide sin. It erases
[1:44:57] it completely. Animal blood hid sin, but
[1:45:02] this blood does not hide it. It erases
[1:45:04] it. That's why, little bride, you never
[1:45:08] did it in the first place.
[1:45:11] Hallelujah. Because the new birth takes
[1:45:13] you back to your origin of where you
[1:45:16] came from.
[1:45:24] And no sin can be attributed
[1:45:27] to a seed of God.
[1:45:30] Amen.
[1:45:33] So the blood does not hide sin. It
[1:45:35] erases it completely. It castes it to a
[1:45:38] sea of forgetfulness. never to be
[1:45:41] remembered again. That's what Micah 7:19
[1:45:45] tells
[1:45:46] us. The color of sin is completely
[1:45:51] erased going back to the mediators of
[1:45:54] time till it falls upon Satan the
[1:45:56] accuser and he's got to bear it to the
[1:45:59] day of judgment.
[1:46:01] Hallelujah.
[1:46:02] So that's what happens to your sin.
[1:46:05] Yeah,
[1:46:06] that's what happens to Satan.
[1:46:09] If you're redeemed today, your sins
[1:46:11] forgiven. Your sins are on his head.
[1:46:15] It has been changed. Hallelujah. From
[1:46:17] the worried one who twisted the word
[1:46:19] from faith to unbelief. And God turn
[1:46:23] took it right back through time, places
[1:46:25] him back on the head of Satan.
[1:46:28] And he'll go to hell for your sins. He
[1:46:31] will burn for your sins because they are
[1:46:34] not your sins. They were his to begin
[1:46:37] with. Who is it that condemns us? Yay.
[1:46:40] It is Christ who has set us free from
[1:46:43] the law of sin and death. Amen.
[1:46:46] Amen.
[1:46:48] But here's the question. What happens to
[1:46:50] the one who's redeemed? We know what
[1:46:53] happened to sin. We know what happened
[1:46:55] to to to Satan. What happens to the one
[1:46:59] who's redeemed? He's restored. That's
[1:47:02] right. To perfect fellowship with the
[1:47:05] father.
[1:47:06] He stands again on the other side of the
[1:47:09] chasm with no memory of sin against him.
[1:47:18] As Hebrews 8:12 says, I will forgive
[1:47:21] their wickedness and remember their sins
[1:47:23] no more.
[1:47:28] That's why you're blameless.
[1:47:30] That's right. That's why you're without
[1:47:32] spot. That's why you're without wrinkle.
[1:47:37] Cuz just as he dissolved in the bleach
[1:47:39] can never be restored, sin annihilated
[1:47:41] in the blood of Christ. Amen. Can never
[1:47:44] come back again. When a sinner is
[1:47:47] cleansed by the blood of Jesus, every
[1:47:49] trace of sin is destroyed. The sin
[1:47:51] itself returns to Satan who will be
[1:47:53] carry who will carry it until the final
[1:47:56] judgment when he's cast into the lake of
[1:47:57] fire. Amen. Through this, the chasm is
[1:48:02] bridged forever. And I even like it when
[1:48:05] brother Brandon would carry this thought
[1:48:06] further in later sermon and he says,
[1:48:08] "There's not even a chasm." That's
[1:48:11] right. Amen. There's not even something
[1:48:13] to point back to. That's right. Of where
[1:48:16] you ever failed. Not even a chasm. Yes,
[1:48:20] sir.
[1:48:24] You stand
[1:48:26] justified,
[1:48:28] covered, not just
[1:48:31] covered, but declared righteous.
[1:48:35] I'm telling you what he's done.
[1:48:41] Now, let me just reference the
[1:48:42] scripture. I want you to write this one
[1:48:44] down. You're not going to be able to
[1:48:45] follow me
[1:48:47] along, but I'm just going to preach it
[1:48:49] for a minute.
[1:48:51] I want you to go to Ephesians chapter 2
[1:48:54] in your notes. Just put it there. But I
[1:48:57] want you to look what the son of God,
[1:48:59] the second Adam's done for us. Because
[1:49:02] once we were separated from Christ, we
[1:49:05] are alienated from the covenant of the
[1:49:07] promise. We were without hope and
[1:49:09] without God in this world.
[1:49:11] But now through the precious blood of
[1:49:13] Jesus, we who were once far off have
[1:49:16] been brought near.
[1:49:18] And so he is our peace breaking down the
[1:49:21] wall of separation, destroyed the
[1:49:23] hostility that once stood between us and
[1:49:25] God. And through his sacrifice, he
[1:49:28] abolished the old commandments contained
[1:49:31] in the ordinances, and established a new
[1:49:33] creation, reconciling both Jew and
[1:49:36] Gentile into one new man into himself.
[1:49:39] Amen. And he did not merely covered our
[1:49:42] sins. He abolished it through his death.
[1:49:44] He shattered the enemy's grip. He
[1:49:47] removed every barrier that kept us from
[1:49:49] the presence of God. And when he arose
[1:49:52] in victory, he proclaimed peace. Peace
[1:49:55] to those who were far off and peace to
[1:49:57] those who were near.
[1:50:00] Hallelujah.
[1:50:03] And through him, I want you to get this.
[1:50:07] Through him, we have direct access
[1:50:12] to the father by one spirit.
[1:50:16] I'm still preaching from Ephesians 2. No
[1:50:19] longer are we strangers or outsiders. We
[1:50:22] are fellow citizens with the saints. We
[1:50:24] are members of the household of God. No
[1:50:27] wonder we say brother and sister
[1:50:30] cuz we got the same fathers. And we're
[1:50:32] not just merely followers. We are are
[1:50:34] part of a holy structure. We're built
[1:50:37] upon the foundation of apostles and
[1:50:39] prophets with Jesus Christ himself being
[1:50:42] the chief cornerstone and him in him the
[1:50:45] whole building is fitly framed together
[1:50:47] growing into a holy temple for the Lord
[1:50:50] a dwelling place for God through the
[1:50:52] spirit.
[1:50:53] You see this is the power of redemption.
[1:50:58] Jesus just not didn't just save us from
[1:51:00] sin.
[1:51:03] No, he restored us to sunship.
[1:51:07] That's right. To dominion, to fellowship
[1:51:10] with the father. The barrier is gone.
[1:51:13] The division is erased. The redeemer has
[1:51:16] made us one with him.
[1:51:19] Do you believe that?
[1:51:22] Amen. So, we ought to rise in faith then
[1:51:24] and walk in in the fullness of our
[1:51:27] inheritance. We hadn't touched the tip
[1:51:29] of it yet. and realize all that what we
[1:51:33] are as sons and daughters of
[1:51:37] God. Listen, we believe when sin is
[1:51:41] completely broken and is
[1:51:43] confessed on the basis of the blood of
[1:51:46] Jesus, just as a drop of black ink
[1:51:49] dissolves into bleach, so does sin
[1:51:53] dissolve into nothingness,
[1:51:55] returning to where it's come from. Amen.
[1:51:59] And that is the power of the blood. We
[1:52:02] sang it about it a while ago. But this
[1:52:04] blood restores
[1:52:06] you across the chasm of separation and
[1:52:10] makes you a true son or daughter of God.
[1:52:14] The creative power of God is then within
[1:52:16] you. Yes. Amen. And when God commands
[1:52:20] us, it will be done.
[1:52:23] Oh, brother Tim, we'd love to see the
[1:52:24] power of creation. What? What do you
[1:52:26] think happened in Atlanta's lungs?
[1:52:31] That was the power of creation.
[1:52:34] Come on. When we are open when the when
[1:52:36] the door of was opened by faith and the
[1:52:39] channel was open. Come on. And rejoicing
[1:52:42] was made in the truth. Amen. Believing
[1:52:45] it was already done. Go back to the
[1:52:48] doctor the next day and not a trace of
[1:52:50] it. What about the alipcia of old
[1:52:54] Mariah? Same thing.
[1:52:57] Same thing. Creative power at work.
[1:53:02] Oh, we're waiting for the spoken word,
[1:53:03] Brother Tim. Creative power is at work.
[1:53:08] It's not coming. It's already here.
[1:53:10] That's right.
[1:53:12] Oh, just let us get our channels cleaned
[1:53:15] out and opened and every flu, clear, and
[1:53:18] every obstacle removed so we can hear
[1:53:21] the voice of God.
[1:53:24] Somebody's got to hear his voice.
[1:53:27] The Bible said, "He that hath an ear,
[1:53:31] let him hear what the spirit is saying."
[1:53:35] So, where is the church today? If we're
[1:53:37] really sons of God, then why do we live
[1:53:40] below beneath our privileges?
[1:53:43] Why are we going around, you know,
[1:53:45] broken and in doubt and and and
[1:53:49] whatever? What didn't he write in the
[1:53:51] laws? I said you were God's.
[1:53:56] Amen.
[1:53:57] I'm not making this up. Jesus said this
[1:54:00] himself in John 10:34 and he was
[1:54:03] referring to to to Psalms 82
[1:54:07] and6. So if the word of God came to the
[1:54:10] prophets and they were called gods
[1:54:13] because they spoke on the behalf of the
[1:54:15] almighty then how can we you know doubt
[1:54:19] our identity in Christ.
[1:54:22] You said but that was prophets. Listen
[1:54:24] listen listen to revelation 10. Thou
[1:54:27] must prophesy again.
[1:54:31] So the bride must be a prophet speaking
[1:54:34] his word.
[1:54:36] Somebody help me preach. Now I want you
[1:54:38] to get this because if the word of God
[1:54:42] came to the prophets,
[1:54:44] what do we see in Revelation 10? the
[1:54:46] word, the book
[1:54:49] taken by the angel, the Holy Spirit to
[1:54:52] wear the bride represented by John, take
[1:54:56] it, eat it, consume it, become one with
[1:54:59] it, and prophesy.
[1:55:01] Speak it.
[1:55:05] So the word of God came to the prophets,
[1:55:08] and they were called
[1:55:10] gods because they spoke on the behalf of
[1:55:13] the Almighty.
[1:55:14] Then how can we doubt our identity in
[1:55:18] Christ
[1:55:19] when he confirms the covenant one more
[1:55:22] time?
[1:55:25] Do you remember in Revelation 10, he
[1:55:27] swears with an oath?
[1:55:31] What is he doing there? He is confirming
[1:55:33] the covenant. Why do you think the whole
[1:55:35] divine healing movement went through
[1:55:37] before the word came? because he was
[1:55:39] confirming the covenant.
[1:55:42] Confirming his attitude toward sin,
[1:55:45] toward sickness, toward disease, toward
[1:55:47] affliction.
[1:55:49] He was confirming the
[1:55:51] covenant. Amen. Before he even revealed
[1:55:54] it.
[1:55:57] Amen. And when he revealed it, it didn't
[1:55:59] take away its power. It magnifies his
[1:56:02] power. That's right. Amen. And so, so
[1:56:05] you said there again, the word came to
[1:56:08] the prophets and they were called gods
[1:56:10] because he spoke on the behalf of the
[1:56:12] Almighty. Who in this day is going to be
[1:56:16] chosen to to speak on the behalf of the
[1:56:19] Almighty? He's got to have a voice on
[1:56:21] the earth. He's got to have somebody
[1:56:23] that speaks for him. Amen. There
[1:56:26] Revelation 3 shows the church Leodysia
[1:56:30] cast out of his mouth. He said, "They
[1:56:32] won't speak for me, but he'll have a
[1:56:34] voice,
[1:56:36] and that voice is in the bride."
[1:56:40] Now, didn't he declare in the book of
[1:56:43] Acts that we are his offspring?
[1:56:46] Did not he say in the in first John,
[1:56:49] "Now you are the sons of God." Then it's
[1:56:52] time to realize that this is adoption
[1:56:54] age where God is placing us in authority
[1:56:57] and power. That's right.
[1:57:00] Yeah. They were they were you know
[1:57:02] infants in Wesley and Luther and Wesley
[1:57:04] and adolescence and so on coming up in
[1:57:06] Isuza Street. But this is a day of the
[1:57:09] mature church
[1:57:12] of adopted sons. Yes. That means placed
[1:57:16] sons
[1:57:17] placed robed with authority. Ring put on
[1:57:20] the finger. Time to act. Time to speak.
[1:57:23] Amen. Time to take dominion. Yes.
[1:57:28] This is the age of full restoration, of
[1:57:31] full redemption, of the handing of the
[1:57:34] title back to man.
[1:57:36] Oh yeah, I know we still wait. We've
[1:57:38] grown within ourselves waiting for that
[1:57:41] complete adoption, the redemption of our
[1:57:43] bodies. But right now, right now, we are
[1:57:47] to reign in victory. That's right.
[1:57:50] Yeah. I I realize there's a lot of
[1:57:53] things that are going to happen in the
[1:57:54] millennium and and and the and and the
[1:57:57] sons of God will be manifested, but
[1:57:59] right now, right?
[1:58:02] Yes. Right now, we need manifestation.
[1:58:06] Amen. Let me just reference Hebrews
[1:58:08] chapter 2. And and again, I'm not going
[1:58:11] to read it. I'm going to preach it.
[1:58:13] Amen. For when God created the earth, he
[1:58:16] did not subject subject the the the
[1:58:19] world to come to angels, but to man. The
[1:58:22] psalmist testified to this truth. What
[1:58:25] is man that you are mindful of him? Or
[1:58:28] the son of man that you care for him.
[1:58:31] You have made him a little lower than
[1:58:33] the angels. You have crowned him with
[1:58:35] glory and honor. You set him over.
[1:58:37] Listen. You set him over. You set him
[1:58:40] over. You set him over the works of your
[1:58:43] hands. And you have put all things in
[1:58:46] subjection, all things in subjection
[1:58:49] under his feet.
[1:58:55] And
[1:58:56] yet, though all
[1:58:58] things were placed under man's
[1:59:01] authority, we don't yet see this fully
[1:59:04] recognized
[1:59:07] or
[1:59:08] realized.
[1:59:11] But before you start looking at
[1:59:14] yourself, we see Jesus.
[1:59:20] A man,
[1:59:22] that all things were put under his feet.
[1:59:27] That through him all things could be put
[1:59:29] under our feet. Amen. Amen. Here the
[1:59:33] second Adam, he humbled
[1:59:36] himself coming down lower than angels,
[1:59:39] taking down human frailties to
[1:59:42] accomplish the greatest triumph of all
[1:59:45] the ages.
[1:59:48] And as I have already established, his
[1:59:50] his humiliation was not defeat. It was
[1:59:54] the very pathway to his ex exaltation.
[1:59:58] He suffered death.
[2:00:00] said by God's grace he might taste death
[2:00:02] for every one of us that through his
[2:00:05] suffering he was made
[2:00:07] perfect not in his divinity no cuz he
[2:00:11] was already perfect always perfect but
[2:00:14] in his mission as our savior the Bible
[2:00:16] said he learned obedience through the
[2:00:19] things that he suffered he fully
[2:00:21] identified
[2:00:23] with human beings he experienced our
[2:00:26] struggles he he stood in our face. You
[2:00:30] know why he done that? To bring many
[2:00:31] sons to glory.
[2:00:34] Not to be alone in his victory, but to
[2:00:37] bring you into that victory.
[2:00:44] The Bible said that Jesus the sanctifier
[2:00:46] and we that are sanctified, we now share
[2:00:49] the same father. Now in this parallel he
[2:00:52] he takes him as a man and shows him as
[2:00:54] our brother. But but we also know he is
[2:00:57] our father.
[2:00:59] But Jesus the sanctifier. We the
[2:01:01] sanctified now share the same father
[2:01:04] because of this. He is not ashamed to
[2:01:07] call us brethren.
[2:01:12] Is that Bible? How many Bible student
[2:01:14] know that's true? Amen. He says he says
[2:01:17] there um he said here I am and the
[2:01:21] children that God has given me. This is
[2:01:22] Isaiah's prophecy. You see he identified
[2:01:26] with
[2:01:26] us. So when we as God's children, we we
[2:01:32] we have flesh and blood. Christ took on
[2:01:36] human form not to remain as God above
[2:01:39] us. Remember brother Brandham's teaching
[2:01:41] of God above us, God with us, God in us.
[2:01:44] Well, he didn't want to remain as God
[2:01:46] above us. So, he became God with us.
[2:01:51] Amen. And he took on human form to
[2:01:54] become one of us. That through death, he
[2:01:56] stripped the devil of his power. He
[2:01:59] rendered him
[2:02:01] powerless. Satan, that one that once
[2:02:04] held the power of death, he was defeated
[2:02:07] at the cross. Amen.
[2:02:13] Listen, until Jesus came, nobody could
[2:02:16] go in God's presence.
[2:02:19] Man was bound forever. That's right.
[2:02:23] Forever is just a has a has an end. It's
[2:02:26] not eternity.
[2:02:28] And there came an end when Jesus came
[2:02:31] because he empties paradise. the place
[2:02:33] that the holy place the way where they
[2:02:36] could not come into God's presence and
[2:02:38] they ascended up with him.
[2:02:41] Are you with me? Amen. So you see for
[2:02:44] years for many many thousands of years
[2:02:47] centuries we can say mankind lived under
[2:02:50] the fear of death because why? We die
[2:02:53] but we we just we were in as it was la
[2:02:57] land. We we were waiting for a redeemer
[2:03:00] to come. Amen. There was nothing to take
[2:03:03] away sin.
[2:03:08] Come on. They were under the blood of
[2:03:10] bulls and goats, but it couldn't take
[2:03:13] away sin. Sin was still there. It had to
[2:03:15] be dealt with. When Jesus went to the
[2:03:18] cross, he dealt with the sins of all men
[2:03:20] all the way back to Eden.
[2:03:24] And when he raised, they raised with
[2:03:26] him.
[2:03:28] Hallelujah. Proving Amen. what the blood
[2:03:32] and the power of the blood can do for
[2:03:35] you and me that are waiting on our
[2:03:38] glorification. We already know in works.
[2:03:42] They paraded the streets of Jerusalem.
[2:03:45] They were seen among many.
[2:03:47] That they were alive,
[2:03:50] alive as Jesus was alive. Who made them
[2:03:53] alive? Jesus made them alive. Who will
[2:03:56] quicken the dead? That they're in
[2:03:58] Christ. Jesus will quicken the dead in
[2:04:00] Christ. Amen.
[2:04:04] Now, but what is the great mystery in
[2:04:07] all of this? The mystery is that God
[2:04:09] didn't extend his deliverance to fallen
[2:04:12] angels. There's no redemption for Satan.
[2:04:16] There's no
[2:04:19] deliverance to demonic spirits,
[2:04:24] which are Satan's angels.
[2:04:27] But there is to the descendants of
[2:04:30] Abraham.
[2:04:33] Now to accomplish
[2:04:34] this, Jesus had to become a faithful and
[2:04:38] merciful high
[2:04:43] priest. And he had to become fully like
[2:04:46] us in order to do that.
[2:04:51] And and so through his suffering, he
[2:04:54] made the atonement for sin, not just
[2:04:58] covered it as we've been through, but
[2:05:00] erase it entirely because when he was
[2:05:04] suffered and was tempted, he is now able
[2:05:07] to help those who are being tested. No
[2:05:10] temptation, no suffering, no burden is
[2:05:12] beyond his reach. He is our victorious
[2:05:15] redeemer, our intercessor, our brother
[2:05:18] who stands before God on our behalf.
[2:05:23] What does this mean to you? That means
[2:05:26] that sin is conquered.
[2:05:29] Death is conquered. Satan is conquered.
[2:05:32] He is a defeated foe.
[2:05:36] Amen. And we're no longer bound by fear.
[2:05:39] That's right. We're no longer sl
[2:05:41] enslaved by Satan's accusations.
[2:05:44] The blood of Jesus Christ has redeemed
[2:05:46] us and restored us to our rightful
[2:05:48] position as sons and daughters of God.
[2:05:52] That's right. Therefore, we should walk
[2:05:54] in victory in the authority that he's
[2:05:56] given us. We ought to be boldly
[2:05:59] proclaiming victory. Amen. Your prayers
[2:06:02] ought to be bold prayers.
[2:06:04] Come on. Not weak prayers, but bold
[2:06:07] prayers. Ask him for big things. Brother
[2:06:10] Brandham challenged you. Said, "Don't
[2:06:11] ask God for little things. Ask him for
[2:06:13] big things." Amen. Standing in faith,
[2:06:16] knowing that all things have been
[2:06:19] subjected under his feet and our feet.
[2:06:23] Amen.
[2:06:28] Now, if the blood of Jes bulls and
[2:06:32] goats, if that if that mere blood,
[2:06:36] animal blood that couldn't take away
[2:06:39] sin, gave Moses the authority to stand
[2:06:42] before Pharaoh and stretch forth his rod
[2:06:45] and command nature and say, "Let there
[2:06:49] come
[2:06:49] flies." And flies came. How much more
[2:06:53] power then do we have under the blood of
[2:06:55] Jesus?
[2:06:57] That's what brother Brandham was trying
[2:06:58] to get us to see in the message God in
[2:07:02] simplicity. How that Moses even under
[2:07:04] the blood of bulls and goats walked in
[2:07:07] God's word and God put his words in his
[2:07:10] mouth. And that's where his word is to
[2:07:12] be in you is in your mouth. Yes, in your
[2:07:16] heart, but it's got to come out of your
[2:07:18] mouth. Where is the sword of the Lord
[2:07:20] held? It's held from the mouth.
[2:07:23] You speak his word and demons flee. You
[2:07:28] speak his word. You declare his word and
[2:07:30] people are healed. You declare his word
[2:07:33] and people are saved.
[2:07:37] It comes by declaring the word.
[2:07:42] You want to keep it hidden your heart,
[2:07:43] it ain't going to do any good there. You
[2:07:45] got to bring it out.
[2:07:50] Moses was told by God, "Stretch out your
[2:07:53] rod toward the east and declare, let
[2:07:54] there be flies." Moses obeyed and the
[2:07:59] word spoken through a man became
[2:08:02] reality.
[2:08:05] Now, that's what happened in the blood
[2:08:06] of bulls and goats. The word of God
[2:08:09] spoken through man became a reality.
[2:08:12] And at first, maybe there was a single
[2:08:14] fly. Soon they stick with them. Yeah.
[2:08:18] Because why? God, he the creator was
[2:08:21] speaking through a man under the blood.
[2:08:28] So you see Moses spoke and frogs covered
[2:08:32] the
[2:08:33] lamb. The words left his lips and
[2:08:36] creation
[2:08:38] responded. It was God revealing his
[2:08:41] power in a simple man. Now, Moses didn't
[2:08:45] speak something and say, "I ain't
[2:08:47] nothing happening yet. Well, I guess I
[2:08:49] might as well go on back now." No, he
[2:08:52] didn't quit. He stood right there. God
[2:08:55] told me to say this. That's right. And
[2:08:57] he spoke and he called and he and he
[2:08:59] released the word and creation
[2:09:01] responded.
[2:09:03] And when you release the word on your
[2:09:05] situation,
[2:09:07] creation is going to respond. Amen.
[2:09:10] Because you see, if that happened of God
[2:09:14] revealing his power in that simple man,
[2:09:17] Amen. that was under the blood of bulls
[2:09:18] and goats, how much more under the blood
[2:09:20] of Jesus?
[2:09:22] That's right. Hallelujah.
[2:09:26] Cuz if the blood of bulls and goats
[2:09:27] could empower Moses to speak God's
[2:09:29] creative word, as brother Brandham said,
[2:09:32] why do we stumble at the power of the
[2:09:34] blood of Jesus? Don't stumble over
[2:09:37] simplicity. Jesus Christ is the same
[2:09:40] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:09:42] Because of his blood, we're fully
[2:09:45] pardoned.
[2:09:46] So if you say to this mountain, that's
[2:09:49] what we're preaching on. Mountain
[2:09:50] movers, if you say to this mountain,
[2:09:54] it's time your mountain hears your
[2:09:55] voice.
[2:09:58] Come on. Whatever you If you believe,
[2:10:00] you don't doubt in your heart, but you
[2:10:02] have that conviction, doubt in your
[2:10:03] heart, that what you say will happen,
[2:10:05] it'll be done for you.
[2:10:07] Amen. You see, it's time that we face
[2:10:10] the issue,
[2:10:12] that we quit perpetuating the church
[2:10:14] ages, but we we face the issue. We have
[2:10:19] arrived to the age of sunship.
[2:10:26] This is not adolescent time anymore.
[2:10:29] This is where field sons speak and their
[2:10:32] words are backed. Yes, sir.
[2:10:36] Come on.
[2:10:39] Now when Moses encountered the burning
[2:10:41] bush, he met the light, the pillar of
[2:10:44] fire,
[2:10:46] he stood there only with a divine
[2:10:48] commission as a prophet. And when the
[2:10:50] word of the Lord came to him, he spoke
[2:10:52] and things were created by the word.
[2:10:57] Now, if this was possible now under the
[2:11:00] blood of bulls and goats, how much
[2:11:02] greater is the power of the blood of
[2:11:04] Jesus?
[2:11:07] Not mere covering but completely
[2:11:08] removing it. His blood places you in the
[2:11:11] presence of God as a redeemed son.
[2:11:15] Amen.
[2:11:18] You say, "Well, brother Tim, but Moses,
[2:11:20] Moses stood there in the presence of a
[2:11:23] pillar of
[2:11:24] fire and he received a commission." If
[2:11:28] you have the Holy Ghost, if you have
[2:11:31] received the Holy Ghost, that today that
[2:11:34] is even a greater encounter with God
[2:11:37] than what Moses had.
[2:11:40] Amen. That fire, that fire anointed
[2:11:42] Moses. But I tell you what, it don't
[2:11:45] just anoint you. Amen. It comes on this
[2:11:49] inside of you. It dwells within you. You
[2:11:53] never lose it.
[2:11:56] And it commissioned you. If it
[2:11:58] commissioned Moses to go conquer Egypt,
[2:12:02] it commissioned you to be a devil
[2:12:04] defeater, a serpent bruiser, to cast
[2:12:07] Satan out and to pull his kingdom down
[2:12:09] to plague him until he lets you go.
[2:12:15] Hallelujah. I wonder how many believers
[2:12:18] are willing to stand there and bring
[2:12:20] plague after plague on the enemy until
[2:12:22] he turns your promise loose.
[2:12:28] It's time somebody do it. Stand right
[2:12:31] there firmly on the word of God.
[2:12:34] Amen. If you don't move here, I'll bring
[2:12:36] another promise. You don't move there,
[2:12:38] I'll bring another promise. Amen. I'm
[2:12:41] going to resist you and resist you and
[2:12:43] resist you and resist you until you
[2:12:45] flee.
[2:12:48] Satan, I've come to tear your kingdom
[2:12:50] down. I have not come as a as a failure.
[2:12:53] I have not come as a defeated person. I
[2:12:56] have come into this world to be an
[2:12:58] overcomer by the new birth of the Holy
[2:13:01] Ghost. I was commissioned by the pillar
[2:13:03] of fire to be a serpent bruiser, a devil
[2:13:06] defeater, an overcomer. Put your foot on
[2:13:08] the head of the serpent.
[2:13:15] Hallelujah.
[2:13:17] I'm not preaching anything new. I'm
[2:13:19] preaching the principles of this
[2:13:20] message.
[2:13:26] The church has lived too long below its
[2:13:28] true standard of
[2:13:30] living that God made for it because we
[2:13:34] often
[2:13:35] hesitate instead of stepping forward.
[2:13:40] There's something wrong with the
[2:13:41] churches. Brother Brandon would say this
[2:13:43] over and over when he when he went into
[2:13:45] God simplicity. I I tell you, the one in
[2:13:47] Albuquerque, he he really nails it down
[2:13:50] again. And he says there's something
[2:13:52] wrong with the churches
[2:13:54] today, and let me just paraphrase it for
[2:13:57] you. They're too They're too earthbound.
[2:14:00] When they should be heavenly minded, you
[2:14:03] know what heavenly minded is? Heaven
[2:14:05] lives by the word.
[2:14:07] Amen. You see, they should be heavenly
[2:14:10] minded, living by the word. But
[2:14:12] denominational systems have twisted
[2:14:14] minds and and left people uncertain
[2:14:17] about how to walk in true
[2:14:21] faith. Yet we we've been promised that
[2:14:25] revelation will come. We've been
[2:14:27] promised that those who know their God,
[2:14:30] what did this message come to do? To
[2:14:32] reveal Christ.
[2:14:34] To reveal Christ. And those who know
[2:14:37] their God will be strong and do
[2:14:40] exploits.
[2:14:43] This message was given to you to empower
[2:14:45] you.
[2:14:47] Amen.
[2:14:53] We've allowed vain philosophies, empty
[2:14:56] traditions, powerless teachings to
[2:14:59] weaken our faith.
[2:15:01] The mind has been so
[2:15:03] bombarded with with theologies and
[2:15:06] opinions and intellectual reasoning and
[2:15:09] scientific
[2:15:11] knowledge and till it's been pulled away
[2:15:15] from the unshakable power of the word of
[2:15:18] God.
[2:15:19] Think about it. We've settled for words.
[2:15:24] We've settled just to have a message
[2:15:28] and at the line ourselves
[2:15:31] and be a good thing as a moral compass
[2:15:33] and a guide and something to give us a
[2:15:35] little inspirational thought for today.
[2:15:37] We have settled for words when they were
[2:15:40] meant for demonstration.
[2:15:44] But I tell you, we're at the hour.
[2:15:48] Friends, we've run out of time. We're at
[2:15:49] the ends of the church ages. We're at
[2:15:52] the day where the the voice of God has
[2:15:55] called somebody to wake up. Amen. To to
[2:15:59] to realize where you are in this day and
[2:16:02] recognize what has always been yours.
[2:16:11] We're We're in the hour when faith must
[2:16:14] rise up within a people. Amen. where
[2:16:18] they're unshackled
[2:16:20] from doubt and the church moves on in
[2:16:23] the power and the anointing of God that
[2:16:25] it was meant to do.
[2:16:30] We're in the time of the casting down of
[2:16:33] Satan.
[2:16:35] And the hour of the resurrection and
[2:16:38] restoration. Do you get those words?
[2:16:42] Restoration, ascension, rapture.
[2:16:46] We're at the hour where where the church
[2:16:48] ascends and is raptured and Satan is
[2:16:51] cast out and his accusations cease.
[2:16:56] As long as the intercessor remains on
[2:16:58] the throne, Satan still accuses us
[2:17:00] before because he stands as the opponent
[2:17:03] of Christ presenting a
[2:17:05] case against humanity.
[2:17:08] And he does it every day.
[2:17:11] Don't play super spiritual and say he
[2:17:13] don't.
[2:17:16] He accuses you every day. Bringing
[2:17:19] doubt, fear, unbelief, sin. Every sin is
[2:17:23] unbelief.
[2:17:25] Amen. Satan will argue, "Oh, but wait,
[2:17:28] Adam fell. I deceived him. I convinced
[2:17:30] his wife to believe a lie. You declared
[2:17:32] she would be condemned for it." And yet
[2:17:34] standing before him is the mediator, the
[2:17:36] kinsman redeemer, holding the blood that
[2:17:38] washes away all sins and transforms the
[2:17:41] vilest
[2:17:42] heart. And the mediator declares they're
[2:17:46] not guilty.
[2:17:49] For the blood has eradicated every
[2:17:52] evidence of sin and sin has returned to
[2:17:55] its urgent back to Satan who perverted
[2:17:58] it at the beginning.
[2:18:04] And through the blood of Jesus, a sinner
[2:18:07] is made holy, stands in God's presence
[2:18:10] as a son, and he stands as a redeemed
[2:18:14] child of God on this side of the chasm
[2:18:17] as a restored son, an heir to the earth.
[2:18:20] Amen. He can command nature, speak into
[2:18:23] existence, and reflect the creative
[2:18:26] power of God. You say, "Oh, brother Tim,
[2:18:29] that's way out on a limb. If you abide
[2:18:31] in me and my words abide in you, you
[2:18:35] will ask what you will."
[2:18:41] Even Jesus, as I've already stated,
[2:18:44] pointed out, said, "Didn't I say even in
[2:18:47] the law, you're gods?"
[2:18:50] Well, brother, if if they were gods,
[2:18:53] that was only potential because it
[2:18:54] couldn't happen till the new birth.
[2:18:58] Amen. How much more are we that have
[2:19:00] been born again?
[2:19:02] Gods.
[2:19:04] Amen. I've said it over and over again.
[2:19:07] Listen, if a dog gives birth, it's a
[2:19:09] dog. If a cat gives birth, it's a cat.
[2:19:11] If a horse gives birth, it's a horse. If
[2:19:13] a human gives birth, it's a human. If
[2:19:15] God gives birth,
[2:19:18] Hallelujah. What is it? It's an
[2:19:20] offspring of God. It's another God. You
[2:19:24] were created have dominion
[2:19:27] to walk in power, to walk in victory, to
[2:19:31] walk in faith. That's right.
[2:19:34] Hallelujah.
[2:19:37] We have been given restored
[2:19:41] authority. Walked completely free from
[2:19:43] every condemnation of sin.
[2:19:46] across the
[2:19:48] chasm. We are redeemed po people walking
[2:19:51] in the creative power of God already.
[2:19:55] Not one day. Already.
[2:19:59] Now, let's talk about it for a moment.
[2:20:01] Let's talk about the word as I bring
[2:20:04] this
[2:20:05] down, you know, in these final thoughts
[2:20:08] today and head down toward the climax of
[2:20:11] this message. A word is simply a thought
[2:20:15] expressed. Right?
[2:20:17] Before
[2:20:19] Moses spoke, God had already wield it.
[2:20:23] When God placed his word in Moses'
[2:20:25] mouth, Moses declared it. It became a
[2:20:27] reality.
[2:20:30] As I've said, maybe there wasn't a
[2:20:31] single fly around, but an hour later,
[2:20:34] here come one fly buzzing by and then
[2:20:37] another. No time, the whole land's
[2:20:39] filled with flies.
[2:20:41] That's the way your mountain moves
[2:20:44] sometimes. One grain at a time, but you
[2:20:46] got to stand there believing it's being
[2:20:48] moved.
[2:20:50] Amen. What was it? What was that when
[2:20:52] that happened with Moses? The creative
[2:20:54] power of the spoken word of God through
[2:20:56] a mortal man. Creative work that belongs
[2:21:00] in the church of Jesus Christ today
[2:21:03] under the blood of Jesus Christ by his
[2:21:06] word. Direct quote.
[2:21:08] So you see if Jesus is the living word
[2:21:13] then what is written in this Bible is
[2:21:15] not just text
[2:21:18] it is a part of him. And if you receive
[2:21:22] this word not just as mere letters on
[2:21:25] the page but as the living infallible
[2:21:29] voice of God it comes alive in you by
[2:21:33] faith.
[2:21:35] Now I want you to catch this revelation.
[2:21:37] The word enters your heart and if the
[2:21:40] Holy Spirit dwells in you, it is
[2:21:43] immediately quickened and it's no longer
[2:21:45] just written words but a living powerful
[2:21:48] force in you and every promise becomes
[2:21:51] real. Therefore, if you say to this
[2:21:54] mountain, be moved and don't doubt in
[2:21:57] your heart, it shall be done. Why?
[2:22:01] Because it's no longer you speaking.
[2:22:03] It's deity speaking through you. Amen.
[2:22:06] Did not Jesus say those words? Don't
[2:22:08] fear when you're brought before
[2:22:09] magistrates? Don't even think of what
[2:22:12] you're going to say because I will be in
[2:22:14] you and I will put my words in your
[2:22:16] mouth. Did not he say that would happen
[2:22:19] to believers?
[2:22:21] Well, then don't you know then if you if
[2:22:23] you're brought before the devil and and
[2:22:25] the accuser comes and sickness comes
[2:22:27] into your home, don't you know that you
[2:22:30] can do the same thing? Don't even have
[2:22:31] to think about what you're going to say.
[2:22:34] But the Holy Spirit will put words in
[2:22:36] your mouth. That's right. Quickening
[2:22:38] power. That's right. To make the devil
[2:22:40] flee.
[2:22:43] Hallelujah.
[2:22:48] Now, Brother Brandham tells us in the
[2:22:50] church age
[2:22:52] book, this word he left behind on
[2:22:54] printed page is a part of him when you
[2:22:57] accept it by faith into his spiritfilled
[2:23:00] life. Amen. He said the word was life.
[2:23:04] John 6 63 John 16:6 says I'm the way,
[2:23:08] the truth, the life. Romans 8:9, if man
[2:23:11] have not the spirit of Christ, he's none
[2:23:13] of his. So we have the spirit. There it
[2:23:15] is. He is spirit. He is life. That's
[2:23:17] exactly what the word is. That's exactly
[2:23:19] what Jesus is. He takes the word so that
[2:23:22] when a spirit born spiritfilled man in
[2:23:25] faith takes that word into his heart and
[2:23:29] places it is upon his lips the same as
[2:23:32] deity speaking every mountain has to go.
[2:23:35] Satan cannot stand before that man.
[2:23:40] Amen. You take his word. You hold it
[2:23:43] before the throne and you declare father
[2:23:46] this is your promise.
[2:23:49] Yes. Hallelujah.
[2:23:54] Now you got the question. Yeah, brother
[2:23:57] Tim, but how do we get to the throne? By
[2:24:00] being born again.
[2:24:02] The heavens opened for you as it did for
[2:24:04] Jesus.
[2:24:07] Didn't it say that at his when the Holy
[2:24:09] Ghost came upon him, heaven's open? Is
[2:24:12] that the truth? Amen. So the heavens
[2:24:15] open for the spirit to ascend and
[2:24:17] descend. And you climb the stairway
[2:24:19] through prayer.
[2:24:22] Through prayer you climb the stairway.
[2:24:24] And as you ascend in the spirit you
[2:24:26] denounce all accusations of the devil,
[2:24:29] all fear, ever doubt. And once before
[2:24:32] the throne, you declare, "Father, it's
[2:24:34] your promise." Then you go to the enemy
[2:24:37] and say, "Satan, you are defeated. Now
[2:24:40] go." And something's got to move. Amen.
[2:24:49] Now the Bible tells us the earth is the
[2:24:52] Lord and the fullness thereof the world
[2:24:54] and all that dwell in them. He founded
[2:24:56] it on the seas and established on the
[2:24:58] floods. Who shall ascend unto the heel
[2:25:01] of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his
[2:25:03] holy place? Here's the question and the
[2:25:05] answer is of who can ascend into the
[2:25:08] hill of the Lord or who can stand in his
[2:25:11] holy place. The answer is he that hath
[2:25:14] clean hands and a pure heart and who has
[2:25:18] not lifted up his soul unto vanity or
[2:25:21] falsehood nor sworn
[2:25:24] deceitfully. He shall receive the
[2:25:26] blessing from the Lord and the
[2:25:27] righteousness from God the God of his
[2:25:29] salvation. So he's asked the question,
[2:25:32] how do we or who can ascend into the
[2:25:35] holy hand into the holy hill of God? Who
[2:25:38] can come in God's presence? And it says,
[2:25:40] "He that has a clean hands, a pure
[2:25:43] heart, who has not sworn deceitfully,
[2:25:48] who hasn't lied,
[2:25:51] Amen." Basically, he that's born again.
[2:25:56] Come on. Come on. I just described to
[2:25:59] you who's born again. If you're born
[2:26:01] again, you got clean hands. You got a
[2:26:04] pure heart. You have not every lie you
[2:26:07] ever told, everything you ever done
[2:26:08] wrong is has all been taken away by the
[2:26:10] blood of Jesus. Amen. You can go before
[2:26:13] the holy hill of God and receive
[2:26:15] blessings from the Lord and
[2:26:17] righteousness from the God of your
[2:26:19] salvation.
[2:26:22] Hallelujah.
[2:26:24] So spiritual authority comes by
[2:26:26] revelation that flows from the throne of
[2:26:29] God. It comes by the Holy Spirit. That's
[2:26:32] why you got to be in tune
[2:26:36] with the spirit of God.
[2:26:39] Because you still have a human spirit.
[2:26:42] Yeah. And that human spirit only knows
[2:26:46] the spirit of a man and the things of a
[2:26:49] man.
[2:26:51] But if you're born again, then you have
[2:26:52] the Holy Spirit. And and as I quote
[2:26:55] brother Brandham here, if Jesus had to
[2:26:57] spend much time in prayer to stay in
[2:26:59] fellowship with the spirit that was in
[2:27:02] him, how much more do you and I have to
[2:27:04] spend time in prayer?
[2:27:08] You see, you cannot weld this power that
[2:27:12] we're talking about. We want creative
[2:27:13] power. We want to we want the power of
[2:27:15] the spoken word. We we want to speak
[2:27:17] flies. We want to do this. We want to
[2:27:19] have the power of creation. You cannot
[2:27:21] wield this power without divine
[2:27:25] revelation.
[2:27:29] Jesus said even though he was the word
[2:27:31] made flesh, he said I do nothing till
[2:27:35] the father shows me first. That's right.
[2:27:38] Amen. So we too have got to be led by
[2:27:41] the spirit.
[2:27:42] Amen. It is is not the word to you until
[2:27:45] it's made manifest to you. And that's
[2:27:47] why many people can't believe in
[2:27:49] miracles today is because the word
[2:27:51] hasn't been revealed to them. They claim
[2:27:54] the days of miracles are passed because
[2:27:55] they've never experienced the
[2:27:57] manifestation. That's right. But Jesus
[2:28:00] said, "All things are delivered unto me
[2:28:02] of my father. No man knows the son but
[2:28:04] the father. Neither knows any man the
[2:28:06] father save the son and he to whomsoever
[2:28:09] the son will reveal him." So you see,
[2:28:12] once God reveals to you what must be
[2:28:16] done, you can stand like Jesus stood and
[2:28:19] declare it with authority.
[2:28:23] Jesus, the very word of God did not act
[2:28:26] out of the father's will.
[2:28:29] And when Jesus or when the father
[2:28:31] revealed it, Jesus spoke it. It was
[2:28:33] done.
[2:28:35] And the same applies today. People deny
[2:28:38] miracles and baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[2:28:39] the full power of God because the word
[2:28:42] isn't revealed to them. But yet the
[2:28:44] truth is when when the word is quickened
[2:28:47] to you and the Holy Spirit has made you
[2:28:50] a fully redeemed son or daughter of God,
[2:28:52] then you speak not as yourself but as a
[2:28:55] vessel of divine authority.
[2:28:59] Amen. Now, God could have used the sun
[2:29:01] to preach the gospel, the moon, the
[2:29:02] stars, the wind to declare his glory.
[2:29:04] But instead, he chose you to do it for
[2:29:08] you to demonstrate. Yeah. Weak, humble
[2:29:11] vessels that you are so that his
[2:29:14] strength can be made perfect in our
[2:29:16] weakness.
[2:29:18] But what's wrong today? We're not fully
[2:29:21] surrendering ourselves to the power of
[2:29:22] God. We're holding back. Amen. If the
[2:29:26] blood of
[2:29:27] animals could give Moses that kind of
[2:29:30] authority, what about the blood of
[2:29:32] Jesus?
[2:29:34] Amen. We we must have faith that moves
[2:29:37] mountains.
[2:29:39] You see, because when that is faith
[2:29:42] resides in you, the creative power of
[2:29:44] God is in you. Or at least when God
[2:29:47] commands it to be done, it'll be done.
[2:29:49] But you can't stand there just fumble in
[2:29:51] your mind and say it with your human
[2:29:53] spirit. You got to get out of your human
[2:29:55] realm and get in the spirit of God and
[2:29:57] catch the mind of the spirit and become
[2:29:59] the voice of the spirit. Find out what
[2:30:03] he wants done with the word.
[2:30:08] Amen.
[2:30:10] Now, somebody is going to give ear to
[2:30:14] the spirit.
[2:30:16] Somebody's going to give a voice to the
[2:30:18] spirit. Amen.
[2:30:21] I'm wondering today, are we in tune?
[2:30:26] Are we hearing too many other voices
[2:30:29] that are crowding out the voice of God
[2:30:31] and we're not hearing it? I can't
[2:30:34] believe that God no longer speaks.
[2:30:38] I can't believe that he no longer heals
[2:30:40] or delivers or set free.
[2:30:42] I believe that the church gets out of
[2:30:45] where they're not listening. They're not
[2:30:47] hearing his voice. They're distracted
[2:30:50] by the evil age that we're that we're
[2:30:52] in. Amen. Listen. Listen, friends. When
[2:30:56] Elijah went up, he sent back a a double
[2:31:00] portion of his spirit. When Elijah went
[2:31:03] up, he dropped his mantel, given a
[2:31:05] double portion. You believe that? Well,
[2:31:07] then what happened? When Jesus ascended
[2:31:09] on the right hand of the father, he sent
[2:31:11] back the Holy Ghost to empower his
[2:31:14] church.
[2:31:15] These sons shall follow them that
[2:31:18] believe in my name they will cast out
[2:31:21] devils. They will speak with new
[2:31:23] tongues.
[2:31:26] They'll take up
[2:31:27] serpents. They drink any deadly thing.
[2:31:30] It'll not hurt them. They'll lay hands
[2:31:31] on the sick and they shall recover. Is
[2:31:34] that the word? Amen. Then why do we live
[2:31:37] below our calling?
[2:31:39] We got to get back to the gospel. Amen.
[2:31:42] We got to stop settling for imitations
[2:31:44] and and weak traditions and seeking
[2:31:47] substitutes when you can have the real
[2:31:49] genuine power of God. Amen. The Holy
[2:31:52] Ghost is real. It's real today. That's
[2:31:54] right. Same power that raised up Jesus
[2:31:57] from the dead dwells in us. That's
[2:31:59] right. But we got to have the mind of
[2:32:01] Christ
[2:32:03] where you stay into his presence until
[2:32:06] every doubt and every fear and every
[2:32:08] hesitation has been burned away by the
[2:32:11] Holy Ghost.
[2:32:12] Because if you're still struggling, if
[2:32:14] you're still doubting, then something's
[2:32:16] wrong with your experience.
[2:32:19] But when you're born again and your sins
[2:32:22] are confessed and washed in the blood,
[2:32:24] you stand there unadulterated, a child
[2:32:27] of God, the life of God in
[2:32:30] you. And when that happens, you can
[2:32:32] speak that word and it'll come to pass.
[2:32:35] Amen.
[2:32:37] Now, Jesus humbled himself and was
[2:32:42] glorified. We've got to humble ourselves
[2:32:44] to this word. We got to say, "Yes, it is
[2:32:47] for us." We got to quit making excuses.
[2:32:52] It's time to start to stop doubting and
[2:32:55] start believing.
[2:32:56] Amen. The blood has been shed. The
[2:32:58] spirit has been given. The word has been
[2:33:00] spoken. How many believes the message
[2:33:02] has been given? Then we ought to walk on
[2:33:04] it. Amen. Walk on that stairway into the
[2:33:07] power of God. You know, doubt and fear
[2:33:10] and all of those things are like skates
[2:33:12] that are left by children on the
[2:33:14] stairway. You know, you don't step on
[2:33:16] them. Down you'll go. Amen. But to
[2:33:19] ascend the stairway, you've got to avoid
[2:33:22] ever fear. Denounce ever doubt. Climb
[2:33:25] the stairway. Get in the presence of
[2:33:27] God.
[2:33:29] Amen.
[2:33:31] Amen.
[2:33:33] We're a word
[2:33:36] bride. And when we receive his word,
[2:33:39] it's his power working in us.
[2:33:43] And Jesus said these
[2:33:45] words, "Whatever you ask the father, in
[2:33:49] my name, that will I do." Amen.
[2:33:54] How many believes that?
[2:33:57] Whatever you ask the father in my name,
[2:34:00] that will I do. Yes. Do you believe it?
[2:34:04] Well, then have you ever stopped? Have
[2:34:07] you ever really stopped to think about
[2:34:09] what it
[2:34:10] means? This is what brother Brandham
[2:34:13] taught us in this fundamental foundation
[2:34:15] for
[2:34:16] faith. That when you go before God in
[2:34:20] Jesus
[2:34:22] name, it is as if Jesus himself is
[2:34:27] praying.
[2:34:34] Did you hear that? Yes.
[2:34:37] Do you realize when we go before God in
[2:34:40] Jesus' name, it's as if Jesus
[2:34:44] himself was praying.
[2:34:47] It's no longer just you or me standing
[2:34:50] there with our own words and our own
[2:34:52] weakness. No, when we pray, he stands in
[2:34:55] our place. Amen. I want you to think
[2:34:58] about it. If if I come before the father
[2:35:00] in my own name, I come with my flaws.
[2:35:04] Right? My failures, my doubts. But when
[2:35:08] I come in his name, everything changes.
[2:35:12] God doesn't see me. He sees his son. He
[2:35:14] hears Jesus voice in my prayer. That's
[2:35:18] what the prophet taught us. And what did
[2:35:20] Jesus say? Whatever you ask the father
[2:35:22] in my name that I do. Not my do, not
[2:35:25] could do, I do it.
[2:35:28] So when I go to the father in Jesus'
[2:35:30] name, it's not even me praying anymore.
[2:35:33] It's him, his spirit, his authority, his
[2:35:35] righteousness praying through me. And if
[2:35:38] Jesus is
[2:35:39] praying, how could the father deny it?
[2:35:43] How could his word fail? It can't.
[2:35:46] That's right. It won't. It'll do exactly
[2:35:49] what he said. That's right. You know
[2:35:51] why? Because when Jesus speaks, things
[2:35:53] happen. That's right. When Jesus pray,
[2:35:56] mountains move. When Jesus intercedes,
[2:36:00] heaven responds. And when we pray in his
[2:36:03] name, we step into that same power. Not
[2:36:06] because of who we are, but because of
[2:36:08] who he is.
[2:36:16] So we are to humble ourselves before
[2:36:19] God.
[2:36:20] and he will exalt us. Amen.
[2:36:24] And as you humble before God, you're
[2:36:26] exalted or lifted into heavenly places.
[2:36:31] But real
[2:36:33] submission
[2:36:35] requires resisting the devil.
[2:36:41] That's what we fail to realize.
[2:36:45] Real submission to God requires
[2:36:47] resisting the devil. standing firm in
[2:36:50] the faith knowing that when we resist
[2:36:52] him, he will flee. Amen. That's right.
[2:36:57] This is vitally
[2:36:59] important. I I can't overemphasize it.
[2:37:03] And as I close this morning, I want to
[2:37:07] want to emphasize it what I
[2:37:10] can.
[2:37:11] Submission will require much more than
[2:37:14] just a humble attitude
[2:37:16] of a stooped shoulder. and a bowed head
[2:37:20] or bended knees,
[2:37:25] but it requires resisting the devil.
[2:37:31] Come on.
[2:37:33] I I I've quoted you the scripture.
[2:37:35] Submit yourself to God, resist the
[2:37:38] devil.
[2:37:42] Submit yourself to God, resist the
[2:37:45] devil.
[2:37:46] Come on. stand firm in faith and knowing
[2:37:50] when we resist him, he'll flee.
[2:37:52] Resisting the devil is part of
[2:37:55] submitting to God. I've submitted it to
[2:37:58] God, Brother Tim. Uh but have you
[2:38:01] resisted the devil?
[2:38:04] When we stand firm on the word of God,
[2:38:06] the devil has no choice but to flee.
[2:38:11] I want you to get this thought. I want
[2:38:13] you to fill your soul with it as you go
[2:38:16] home. moment. I want I want it to change
[2:38:18] your thinking forever.
[2:38:20] What does it mean to submit to God? He's
[2:38:22] the general, right? We're in a war.
[2:38:26] We're in a battle, right? Amen. He He's
[2:38:29] the captain of our salvation. Correct.
[2:38:32] Amen. So, he gives the marching orders,
[2:38:35] right? His orders are resist the devil.
[2:38:46] Did you get your orders?
[2:38:48] Look, the orders he left the church was
[2:38:52] resist the devil. In my name, cast him
[2:38:56] out.
[2:38:58] In my name, heal the sick. That's right.
[2:39:05] So, he left us a commission. He left us
[2:39:07] orders. You see, to not actively resist
[2:39:12] is insubordination.
[2:39:15] To be passive and let the devil run over
[2:39:17] you is defying God's authority and
[2:39:19] refusing to obey orders.
[2:39:22] The orders are kick him out.
[2:39:27] Amen. Oh, if we could just clear the
[2:39:30] channel and sweep away our man-made
[2:39:33] doctrines and fear and doubt and
[2:39:35] religious formalities and our excuses
[2:39:37] and fully surrender to the will of God,
[2:39:39] that the church would explode in the
[2:39:42] supernatural. Why? Because it would kick
[2:39:45] Satan out. This is the time to bring
[2:39:49] Satan down. It is the casting down of
[2:39:53] Satan. Amen. It is the ascending of the
[2:39:56] church. It is time that you as a body of
[2:39:58] Christ rise in power,
[2:40:02] knowing your calling, seeing you're
[2:40:04] under the blood. Your sins are gone. You
[2:40:07] stand as redeemed children of God. And
[2:40:11] every devil's got to go. Every
[2:40:13] mountain's got to move. Amen. Satan is
[2:40:16] defeated. And Jesus Christ is a
[2:40:18] conqueror. And we're we're behind his
[2:40:20] banner this morning following our
[2:40:22] captain who said, "Take the devil out. I
[2:40:26] want you to resist him in your life.
[2:40:28] Cast him out of your home. Cast him out
[2:40:30] of your family. Cast him out of the
[2:40:32] church. And let the spirit of God reign
[2:40:35] supreme. Let's stand together and
[2:40:37] worship God. Hallelujah. Amen. As the
[2:40:41] musicians come, we were we were we
[2:40:43] weren't created to live beneath our
[2:40:45] calling and our beneath our privilege.
[2:40:48] We were born again for reign,
[2:40:51] to have dominion, to be a new creation
[2:40:53] in Christ, designed to rule, to control,
[2:40:57] to bring praise to the Almighty. But die
[2:41:00] to your thinking.
[2:41:02] He told you to resist.
[2:41:05] He's going to flee.
[2:41:09] Are you resisting the devil?
[2:41:11] Is the church resisting the devil? Oh,
[2:41:14] no. We just pray a little passive prayer
[2:41:16] and oh God help this poor person. We got
[2:41:18] to believe that he is and that he'll
[2:41:21] reward those that climb the
[2:41:25] stairway. Come into his
[2:41:27] presence. Ignore the voice of the
[2:41:30] accuser cuz he's going to accuse you
[2:41:32] every step of the way. He going to tell
[2:41:34] you why you shouldn't climb a little
[2:41:36] higher. Why that you don't deserve to be
[2:41:38] in God's presence. reminds you of past
[2:41:41] failures and faults and and what you've
[2:41:44] done in the past. But I want you to
[2:41:46] remind him this morning, Jesus paid it
[2:41:48] all and all my sins are gone and I'm
[2:41:52] washed in the blood of the lamb and I
[2:41:54] stand as redeemed property and healing
[2:41:57] is mine and deliverance is mine and
[2:41:59] salvation is coming to my house today.
[2:42:02] Amen. Deliverance is coming to my home.
[2:42:05] Amen. We're going to walk in victory. We
[2:42:07] are a people of faith.
[2:42:10] and walk in that faith.
[2:42:14] Yes. Hallelujah.
[2:42:16] The blood shall never lose its power.
[2:42:20] [Music]
[2:42:22] We got to quit leaning on the
[2:42:24] smallmindedness of human understanding
[2:42:28] and learn to lean on the mind of Christ.
[2:42:30] What did he say I am? Not what you feel
[2:42:33] like.
[2:42:35] What did he say?
[2:42:39] Not what reason says. The doctor says
[2:42:43] you can never get well, but God says you
[2:42:45] can. I'm the Lord God that heals all
[2:42:48] diseases.
[2:42:49] [Music]
[2:42:57] His blood will never lose its
[2:43:00] [Music]
[2:43:03] power. It won't.
[2:43:06] He's still the
[2:43:09] intercessor. You see, false traditions
[2:43:12] want to make it where, oh, that's all
[2:43:16] passed. If that's true, the blood is no
[2:43:19] more. And there no intercession through
[2:43:23] the blood and that's the only way you
[2:43:27] can come.
[2:43:29] So that means no one else can be saved.
[2:43:32] Oh, we'll give them life. You can't give
[2:43:34] them life. Only Christ can give them
[2:43:36] life. Salvation comes only through the
[2:43:39] blood, the Holy Spirit. And the Holy
[2:43:41] Spirit is just as viable and real today.
[2:43:44] And it's for every person. It's for
[2:43:47] everyone.
[2:43:48] [Music]
[2:43:52] The same
[2:43:54] power that operated in Jesus
[2:43:58] ought to flow from through us just as
[2:44:00] naturally as breathing.
[2:44:04] until miracles are no longer
[2:44:05] [Music]
[2:44:09] rare. I'm looking at the end.
[2:44:13] You might be looking here. I'm looking
[2:44:14] at the end. Remember the boy with the
[2:44:15] bicycle?
[2:44:17] Amen. The way he won the prize was how
[2:44:20] not by looking at here and all the
[2:44:22] dangers here and falling off. They they
[2:44:24] put it on a a little tiny pathway, you
[2:44:27] know, and the one who could ride this
[2:44:28] this deal all the way would win the new
[2:44:31] swim bike.
[2:44:33] and all of them fell off. But this one
[2:44:36] little boy, he wasn't all that
[2:44:41] athletic. But when he got down to the
[2:44:43] end, he looked up to the other boys and
[2:44:46] said, "Boys, the reason why you fell
[2:44:48] because you looked down here. I kept my
[2:44:51] eye on the end."
[2:44:53] I'm looking at the end. I'm looking at,
[2:44:57] friends, where the bride will be
[2:44:58] glorified. Where we're going to be
[2:45:00] changed in a moment, in a twinkling eye,
[2:45:02] where all sickness will fade away, where
[2:45:04] missing limbs will be restored, where
[2:45:06] blind eyes will be open. Come on. I'm
[2:45:09] looking at the end. I'm looking at the
[2:45:11] full promise. And I'm just saying as
[2:45:13] we're pedaling down the road, that power
[2:45:15] that the Holy Ghost is taking us right
[2:45:17] into there. And as we near that, the
[2:45:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost gets stronger
[2:45:22] and stronger and stronger. And the power
[2:45:25] of of the church rises. It don't
[2:45:27] decrease, it increases.
[2:45:31] Yes, sir.
[2:45:32] So expect increase in your power.
[2:45:38] And for us to be glorified.
[2:45:42] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:45:44] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:45:47] Thank you, Jesus. Can you just stop and
[2:45:49] thank him for a minute
[2:45:52] of what he has done for you and what the
[2:45:54] blood has done?
[2:45:56] Can you just stop for a
[2:45:59] minute and
[2:46:02] say,
[2:46:04] [Music]
[2:46:07] "Lord, you've taken the vile
[2:46:10] center. You made me clean, acceptable in
[2:46:14] your
[2:46:15] sight. And right now I'm coming by faith
[2:46:18] in your
[2:46:20] presence. Through the door, Jesus, till
[2:46:22] heaven was open, the stairway was
[2:46:26] made. Oh God, let me ascend in your
[2:46:29] presence as I walk ascending into the
[2:46:32] holy hill. Let your spirit come down,
[2:46:35] Lord,
[2:46:37] delivering me, oh God, bringing
[2:46:39] deliverance for me, my family, for my
[2:46:41] needs
