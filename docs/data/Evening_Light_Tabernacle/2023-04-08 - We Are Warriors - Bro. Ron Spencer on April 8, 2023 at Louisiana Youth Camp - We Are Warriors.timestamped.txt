[52:56] and he knew what kind of a Fighters you
[52:58] would be
[52:59] the tenacity that would be inside of you
[53:03] that you wouldn't give up and run back
[53:06] when the battle got hot
[53:09] you would Church
[53:12] you would grab your rock like David put
[53:16] it in the slink
[53:17] and God armed you with the greatest
[53:19] weapon that he could arm you with with
[53:21] the word of God
[53:24] Hallelujah
[53:25] tell your neighbor just now we are
[53:28] warriors
[53:35] amen now tell them like you really mean
[53:38] it
[53:48] so if we are warriors
[53:50] let's make a declaration
[53:53] Bring It On

[54:09] if you'll turn with into second Samuel
[54:11] chapter 22. and verse 29

[54:33] you guys are just awesome
[54:35] you're God's best
[54:38] and he saved you for the end
[54:41] that's why you fight like you do
[54:45] every one of you live in your own circle
[54:47] of life
[54:48] and God puts you there
[54:51] he didn't have to put a thousand people
[54:52] around you to cut you up
[54:55] you stand there and overcome on your own
[54:59] by the blood of the Lamb
[55:01] and by the word of your
[55:05] testimony
[55:06] and every one of you have a testimony
[55:10] and we're going to make it
[55:13] second Samuel chapter 22 and verse 29.
[55:18] for thou art my lamp
[55:22] oh Lord
[55:24] and the Lord will lighten my darkness
[55:27] for by Thee I have ran through I have
[55:30] run through a troop
[55:32] and by God I have leaped over a wall
[55:36] it's quite a good way to start isn't it
[55:39] as for God his way is perfect
[55:42] the word of the Lord is tried
[55:44] he is a buckler to all of them that
[55:47] trust in him
[55:49] for who is God save the Lord and who is
[55:53] a rock Save Our God
[55:56] is my strength and power
[55:58] and he maketh my way perfect
[56:01] he maketh my feet like Hinds feet
[56:05] setteth me upon my high places
[56:08] he teacheth me
[56:10] My Hands to War
[56:12] so that a bow of Steel is broken in mine
[56:16] arms
[56:17] thou has given me a she The Shield of my
[56:21] salvation and the gentleness hath made
[56:24] me great
[56:26] thou Hast enlarge my steps under me so
[56:30] that my feet did not slip
[56:33] I have pursued mine enemies and
[56:35] destroyed them
[56:37] and turn not again unto until I have
[56:40] consumed them
[56:41] I have consumed I have consumed them and
[56:44] wounded them that they could not arise
[56:48] yea they are Fallen under my feet
[56:52] for thou has girded me with strength to
[56:55] battle
[56:56] them that Rose against me hast thou
[56:59] subdued unto me
[57:01] thou has also given me the next you've
[57:05] heard that before the Nets of mine
[57:07] enemies that I might destroy them that
[57:10] hate me
[57:12] Isaiah 53 and verse 1.
[57:19] who hath believed our reporting to whom
[57:21] is the arm of the Lord revealed and we
[57:24] say Amen
[57:26] for he shall grow up before him as a
[57:28] tender plan not as a root out of dry
[57:30] ground and he hath no form or timeliness
[57:32] and when we shall see him there is no
[57:35] beauty that we should desire him
[57:37] he is despised and rejected of men a Man
[57:41] of Sorrows acquainted with grief
[57:43] and we hid as if it were our faces from
[57:46] him he was despised and we esteemed him
[57:49] not
[57:50] surely he hath borne our Greeks carried
[57:53] our sorrows yet we did esteem him
[57:56] stricken and smitten of God and
[57:59] Afflicted I want you to read this next
[58:01] verse with me
[58:03] but he was wounded for our
[58:06] transgressions
[58:07] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[58:11] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[58:14] and with his stripes we are healed
[58:21] Heavenly Father
[58:25] we stand here ready for battle
[58:31] not only is a speaker but also his
[58:33] hearers
[58:35] now father we realize that you are the
[58:38] one that has gathered us together
[58:41] from all places of the Earth
[58:44] and we have come
[58:45] it is our moment it is our time
[58:49] now Lord Jesus we just ask you father
[58:52] that you would anoint this atmosphere
[58:56] May every electron in this building be
[58:59] anointed by the Holy Ghost
[59:02] we surrender ourselves as speaker and as
[59:05] hearer
[59:06] Lord we ask you to forgive us of every
[59:08] sin
[59:10] every besetting thing that would come
[59:12] against us
[59:13] and Lord we ask you now that you would
[59:15] anoint our hearts and knowing our minds
[59:17] and knowing our lips we have prepared
[59:20] ourself
[59:21] you have dealt with us in the very early
[59:23] mornings and turned us even to this hour
[59:26] we ask you now that you would anoint
[59:29] your children
[59:30] and Lord as they respond to the word
[59:32] it's not my word it's your words
[59:35] and father Lord Mayes brother Branham
[59:40] would pet Fritz and
[59:42] and he would just tell him sicking
[59:45] Lord may we realize that we all have a
[59:47] common enemy
[59:49] and that enemy is to come to kill and
[59:51] steal and destroy
[59:53] but we have come tonight to make a
[59:55] declaration
[59:56] he is defeated
[1:00:00] he is defeated at Calvary
[1:00:02] the war has taken place and our champion
[1:00:06] arose
[1:00:08] on Easter morning and we have an empty
[1:00:11] tomb today
[1:00:12] he conquered death Helen the grave and
[1:00:16] took the Keys of the Kingdom away from
[1:00:18] Satan
[1:00:19] now father we ask you to touch your
[1:00:22] children tonight and every need that
[1:00:25] would come we ask you to touch them in
[1:00:27] the name of Jesus Christ and this
[1:00:29] congregation says amen you may be seated
[1:00:40] I'd like to speak to you this afternoon
[1:00:42] on we are warriors
[1:00:46] I'd like to make it personal to you
[1:00:48] invite you to repeat it with me I am a
[1:00:52] lawyer
[1:00:54] ah I am a warrior
[1:00:58] I want you to say it until you believe
[1:01:00] it
[1:01:01] ah
[1:01:02] I am a warrior
[1:01:04] now anybody can fight here and stand
[1:01:07] here in this audience with all of these
[1:01:09] around you and say and say the
[1:01:11] Declaration but what about when you're
[1:01:13] home
[1:01:15] what about when you're standing by
[1:01:17] yourself
[1:01:19] what about when the enemy's breathe in
[1:01:21] his hot breath down your neck
[1:01:27] and it's you and Jesus
[1:01:29] now with that in mind I am a warrior
[1:01:36] the scripture says in Isaiah 54 and
[1:01:39] verse 17 no weapon
[1:01:42] that is formed against thee
[1:01:45] shall prosper
[1:01:46] every tongue
[1:01:49] that shall rise against thee in judgment
[1:01:52] Thou shalt condemn
[1:01:55] so your Tormentor
[1:01:58] is going to be judged by your testimony
[1:02:01] this is the heritage of the Servants of
[1:02:04] the Lord
[1:02:05] and their righteousness is of me saith
[1:02:08] the Lord Philippians chapter 1 and verse
[1:02:11] 6 be in confidence of this confident of
[1:02:15] this very thing that he which hath begun
[1:02:18] a good work in you will perform it until
[1:02:23] the day of Jesus Christ
[1:02:27] God is not in the business of getting
[1:02:30] halfway with you
[1:02:33] many of your friends May quit on you
[1:02:37] there may be an urge to where you say I
[1:02:40] give up I can't stand the battle but
[1:02:43] just then God comes on the scene for you
[1:02:46] cause he'll never leave you he'll never
[1:02:49] forsake you he'll be with you to the end
[1:02:51] that's his word that's his promise
[1:02:56] with that in mind we can quote
[1:02:58] Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13. I
[1:03:02] can do all things
[1:03:05] put it with me I can do all things
[1:03:07] through Christ which strengthens me
[1:03:14] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 finally
[1:03:17] my brethren be strong in the Lord
[1:03:21] and in the power of His might
[1:03:24] you say brother Ron but I don't feel
[1:03:26] strong brother random said when the
[1:03:28] weakest
[1:03:30] of Christians go on their knees
[1:03:34] when the weakest of Christians
[1:03:37] go on their knees they cause hell to
[1:03:41] tremble
[1:03:44] put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:03:46] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[1:03:49] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[1:03:51] flesh and blood but against
[1:03:53] principalities against Powers against
[1:03:56] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:03:59] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:04:02] places
[1:04:05] wherefore taken to you the whole armor
[1:04:07] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:04:10] in the evil day and haven't done all to
[1:04:13] stand stand therefore
[1:04:16] with your loins gird about with truth
[1:04:21] with the breastplate of the
[1:04:23] righteousness
[1:04:25] and your feet shot with the preparation
[1:04:27] of the gospel of peace above all taken
[1:04:30] the shield of faith
[1:04:33] who's going to do this you are
[1:04:37] who's going to do this you are
[1:04:41] taking the shield of Faith wherewith you
[1:04:43] may be able to quench all the fiery
[1:04:46] darts of the wicked and take the helmet
[1:04:49] of of Salvation and this
[1:04:53] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:04:56] God
[1:04:57] praying always
[1:05:01] pray in all ways prayer is more powerful
[1:05:06] than an atomic bomb
[1:05:09] and because you are who you are
[1:05:12] a son and daughter of God has more
[1:05:14] Authority than an archangel in heaven
[1:05:17] because who you are and it's your
[1:05:20] communication with God
[1:05:24] you're not going through a father you're
[1:05:26] not going through a priest you're not
[1:05:28] going through your favor preacher it's
[1:05:30] you and God
[1:05:34] [Applause]
[1:05:40] Mark chapter 16.
[1:05:42] and verse 15. Jesus is in his final
[1:05:46] words and he saith unto them go ye into
[1:05:49] all the world
[1:05:51] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:05:54] and he that believeth and is baptized
[1:05:57] shall be saved and he that believeth not
[1:05:59] shall be damned now notice these next
[1:06:02] words and these signs shall follow them
[1:06:04] that believe
[1:06:08] in my name
[1:06:10] in my name what a powerful song a few
[1:06:13] moments ago in my name shall they cast
[1:06:15] out devils and they shall speak with new
[1:06:18] tongues and they shall take up serpents
[1:06:20] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[1:06:23] shall not hurt them they shall lay hands
[1:06:26] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:06:31] this is God's word this is God's promise
[1:06:38] I I like this
[1:06:40] I like this this the this this quotation
[1:06:45] we will fight on the beaches
[1:06:48] we shall fight on the land and the
[1:06:50] grounds
[1:06:51] we shall fight in the fields and in the
[1:06:54] streets
[1:06:55] we shall fight in the Hills
[1:06:57] we shall Never Surrender
[1:07:03] we will fight for our families
[1:07:06] we will fight for our children
[1:07:08] we will fight for our healing
[1:07:11] we will fight for deliverance
[1:07:13] we will fight for joy we will fight for
[1:07:17] peace we will fight for the Holy Ghost
[1:07:21] we will fight until our bodies are
[1:07:23] changed
[1:07:24] and we're sitting at the marriage supper
[1:07:27] of the Lamb I want to tell the devil
[1:07:29] we're not surrendering
[1:07:34] I wanted to hear it from our lips we
[1:07:37] refuse to surrender
[1:07:40] we refuse to give up we refuse to run
[1:07:44] back we are not cowards
[1:07:53] [Applause]
[1:07:56] now Satan knows that you're here
[1:08:00] he knows that you are something that he
[1:08:02] has to contend with
[1:08:05] he's got the world
[1:08:07] but he has to fight you
[1:08:12] and he don't have long to work
[1:08:15] but you have been armed just because he
[1:08:18] attacks
[1:08:21] don't mean you have to surrender to him
[1:08:29] Satan knows that
[1:08:32] that there is nothing
[1:08:35] that he can do to stop our Lord
[1:08:38] think about that
[1:08:40] he knows that the resurrection's coming
[1:08:42] and he can't stop it
[1:08:46] he knows there's a bride on the scene
[1:08:48] and he can't stop it
[1:08:51] he knows there's a Rapture get ready to
[1:08:53] happen he can't stop it
[1:08:57] and if we could just put it real
[1:08:59] personal he can't stop you
[1:09:03] he can only try to distract you but he
[1:09:06] can't stop you
[1:09:10] but brother Ron I've been in some real
[1:09:12] battles well let me just mention a few
[1:09:14] to you
[1:09:15] we talk about Sarah
[1:09:18] but Sarah endured 90 years
[1:09:23] of frustrating humiliation of being
[1:09:27] barren
[1:09:30] none of us have ever had a day like job
[1:09:33] had
[1:09:35] but he had a revelation
[1:09:40] he had a revelation no matter what his
[1:09:42] friends turned against him his wife
[1:09:43] turned against him his flesh was laid up
[1:09:46] with balls he was bankrupt on every hand
[1:09:49] but he said though God slay me yet I'm
[1:09:52] going to trust him
[1:10:00] Isaac staggered in the Darkness
[1:10:04] in the blindness
[1:10:07] and it was because God
[1:10:10] had a plan
[1:10:12] because as a natural man he would have
[1:10:15] picked Esau
[1:10:17] but God picked Jacob
[1:10:21] there was a widow when her son was
[1:10:23] starving to death
[1:10:26] but if she could only get past the trial
[1:10:30] and take the prophet at his word
[1:10:33] she would have a barrel that would be
[1:10:36] Unlimited
[1:10:38] she would have a cruise of all
[1:10:41] that would be Unlimited if you can get
[1:10:44] past your trunk
[1:10:50] if you can get past your truck
[1:10:53] are you with me now sometimes your
[1:10:56] greatest trial only tells you that's
[1:10:58] your greatest Victory is laying right in
[1:11:01] front of you
[1:11:04] [Applause]
[1:11:09] Shadrach Meshach could have been to go
[1:11:12] their their names roll off of their lips
[1:11:14] so quickly but they refuse to bend and
[1:11:17] bow
[1:11:18] they were thrown into a fiery furnace
[1:11:21] but it was there
[1:11:24] it was in the midst of their hardest
[1:11:26] trial
[1:11:28] that is where God met them
[1:11:30] let me just say if you look hard enough
[1:11:32] in the midst of your hardest trial I
[1:11:35] know what I'm talking about now and I
[1:11:37] miss you your hardest trial that's where
[1:11:39] God will meet you
[1:11:42] Bartimaeus was blind
[1:11:45] but he screamed thou son of David have
[1:11:48] mercy upon me it was physically
[1:11:51] impossible for Jesus to hurt him hurt
[1:11:54] him but his faith spread out
[1:12:00] he went home healed
[1:12:03] nobody would have to lead him to the
[1:12:04] wall ever again
[1:12:09] tonight can be the difference in your
[1:12:11] life
[1:12:12] you was blind you were sick
[1:12:15] you was without the Holy Ghost you was
[1:12:19] lost without God but that night in
[1:12:23] Louisiana changed my life I'll never be
[1:12:27] the same ever again
[1:12:38] Lazarus died
[1:12:40] and it seemed like that God was had
[1:12:43] carried way too long
[1:12:46] but let me just say this to you Jesus is
[1:12:49] always on time
[1:12:52] won't you say it with me Jesus is always
[1:12:57] on time
[1:13:00] he had to get sick
[1:13:03] he had to come to a point to where that
[1:13:05] even his critics said worse Jesus when
[1:13:07] you really need him
[1:13:10] the doubters were in his ears at the
[1:13:13] last moment
[1:13:15] Jesus knows how to shut doubters up
[1:13:22] and he asked the sisters roll away the
[1:13:25] stone
[1:13:28] Jesus could have blowed the stone away
[1:13:32] he could have spoke the stone away but
[1:13:34] sometimes he asked you to have faith in
[1:13:37] what he's getting ready to do
[1:13:44] he's asking you to have faith in what
[1:13:46] he's saying
[1:13:49] will you step forth while everybody's
[1:13:51] laughing
[1:13:52] while every critic is making fun of you
[1:13:55] will you
[1:13:59] will you
[1:14:01] take a hole to the stone with your hands
[1:14:05] you may not have the strength to push it
[1:14:07] over just put your hands on the rock
[1:14:10] Gotta Give You Supernatural power to
[1:14:14] push the stone out of it
[1:14:17] because there's a dead man that's not
[1:14:19] going to be dead much longer
[1:14:24] and Lazarus was in another realm
[1:14:27] fellowshipping with the Patriots of old
[1:14:29] but he heard a voice that he was very
[1:14:31] familiar with
[1:14:33] and that voice called him by name God
[1:14:36] knows how to call you by name
[1:14:39] [Applause]
[1:14:47] he came walking out of that tomb
[1:14:50] Jesus instructed to sisters take off
[1:14:54] these great clothes
[1:14:58] he's not going to need them no more
[1:15:07] I don't know what you can't clothe with
[1:15:09] today maybe it's depression maybe it's a
[1:15:11] lot of different things you're not gonna
[1:15:13] need that no more
[1:15:20] [Applause]
[1:15:24] on the roughest of days
[1:15:26] the lowest hours of our despair
[1:15:30] sister Erica if you're listening this is
[1:15:33] for you
[1:15:33] even in those times
[1:15:36] we're still chosen
[1:15:41] we're still blessed
[1:15:44] we're still favored
[1:15:46] we're still forgiven
[1:15:48] we're still loved
[1:15:50] we're still that of God
[1:15:52] we're still Victorious
[1:15:56] we're in heck we're inheritors of All
[1:15:59] That Heaven has
[1:16:01] we're privileged to walk with our own
[1:16:03] Creator we're married to the King of
[1:16:06] Kings he calls us his beloved we're
[1:16:10] strong in faith armed to fight Devils
[1:16:13] entrusted with God's word the most
[1:16:16] powerful weapon we're protected by the
[1:16:19] arm of the almighty he places his hedge
[1:16:22] around us we have an assurance that
[1:16:25] every time that we call he hears he
[1:16:29] answers
[1:16:33] every time that we come
[1:16:36] he hears
[1:16:40] he answers
[1:16:42] because he is our God
[1:16:48] this is yours
[1:16:49] this is your word here
[1:16:52] another man says
[1:16:54] why does God let troubles come
[1:16:59] God harnesses troubles
[1:17:03] puts bits in its mouth
[1:17:06] and makes it obey him
[1:17:11] these troubles
[1:17:14] bring us closer
[1:17:16] fellowship with God
[1:17:22] I asked God
[1:17:24] why are you taking me through such
[1:17:26] Troubled Water
[1:17:28] and he replied
[1:17:31] because you're intimate
[1:17:33] don't know how to swim

[1:17:57] and the Earth
[1:17:59] moon the stars refused to sign
[1:18:03] he conquered it
[1:18:05] and when he went down and descended down
[1:18:07] and knocked at the door
[1:18:08] where the lost souls was I mean the
[1:18:11] doors came open those people who laughed
[1:18:14] and made fun of Enoch
[1:18:16] who made fun of Noah I can hear him say
[1:18:19] I am that one
[1:18:21] that Enoch said would come with ten
[1:18:24] thousand of his Saints
[1:18:25] why didn't you believe Enoch
[1:18:28] why didn't you believe Noah
[1:18:30] everything had to know that he'd
[1:18:32] conquered when he shut the door on them
[1:18:35] the days of mercies was passed on down
[1:18:38] into the lowest pits of hell he went and
[1:18:41] he knocked at the city doors of the
[1:18:43] devil's hell
[1:18:44] and all that Devil comes to the door and
[1:18:47] as he come to look to see there he was
[1:18:50] he said well here you are after all I
[1:18:54] sure thought I had you when I killed the
[1:18:56] prophets I thought I had you when I cut
[1:18:58] John's head off in prison but now you're
[1:19:01] here
[1:19:03] and I can hear him say as he
[1:19:05] straightened himself up Satan

[1:19:28] belongs he conquered hell
[1:19:40] when he arose he's had the keys of death
[1:19:42] and Hell hanging on his side so what is

[1:20:03] this word declares us overcome us
[1:20:07] we can't lose

[1:20:19] David would say in Psalms 27
[1:20:22] and verse 1 the Lord is my light and my
[1:20:26] salvation Whom Shall I feel
[1:20:39] Whom Shall I Fear

[1:20:48] baddest demon that Satan's got to offer
[1:20:51] why should I fear

[1:21:50] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[1:21:53] foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:21:54] they stumbled and fell though a host
[1:21:57] shouldn't Camp against me my heart shall
[1:21:59] not fail the war should rise against me
[1:22:01] and this will I be confident one thing
[1:22:03] that I have desired of the Lord that
[1:22:05] will I seek after that I may dwell in
[1:22:07] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:22:11] life
[1:22:14] to behold the beauty of the Lord into
[1:22:16] inquiring this Temple for in the time of
[1:22:20] trouble

[1:22:24] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[1:22:26] me he shall set me up on a rock
[1:22:29] now shall my head be lifted up above my
