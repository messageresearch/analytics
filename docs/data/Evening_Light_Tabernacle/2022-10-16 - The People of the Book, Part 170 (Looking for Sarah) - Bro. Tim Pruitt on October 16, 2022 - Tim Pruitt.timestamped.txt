[55:25] like to turn to Genesis 18 before
[55:27] you're seated so Genesis 18 and we'll
[55:31] read from verse 1 and then I want to go
[55:33] immediately to verse 9 and the Lord
[55:36] appeared unto him in the plains of
[55:38] memory and he sat in the tent Door In
[55:41] the Heat of the day and they said unto
[55:42] him where is Sarah thy wife and he said
[55:45] behold in the tent and he said I will
[55:49] certainly return unto thee according to
[55:51] the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife
[55:54] shall have a son and Sarah heard it in
[55:57] the tent door which was behind him now
[56:00] Abraham and Sarah was well were old and
[56:03] well spoken in age and it ceased to be
[56:05] with Sarah after the manner of women
[56:07] therefore she laughed within herself
[56:10] saying after I am old and waxed old and
[56:14] shall I have pleasure my Lord being old
[56:16] also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[56:19] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[56:23] of assured he bear a child which I'm old
[56:26] is anything too hard for the Lord at
[56:30] that time appointed I will return unto
[56:33] thee according to the time of life and
[56:36] Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied
[56:39] Saiyan I laughed not for she was afraid
[56:41] but he said nay but thou did his life
[56:44] amen God bless you can be seated
[56:47] amen I I just wanted to take a time a
[56:51] moment here while we're all home as a
[56:54] homebody and be able to express my my
[56:58] appreciation and my love to you and
[57:01] gratitude for
[57:02] um a wonderful time that you gave
[57:05] everybody at the at our October meetings
[57:09] it was a just a tremendous time in the
[57:11] Lord and and I want to say thank you for
[57:14] what you did and the part that you
[57:17] played every one of you making a
[57:19] contribution somewhere and you know I I
[57:22] want to thank you for giving shade as an
[57:24] old oak tree and keeping people in your
[57:26] homes and and providing food and helping
[57:29] out in many other ways and uh you know
[57:33] the preparations for the meetings and
[57:35] after the meetings and everything that
[57:37] was done and our servants to this church
[57:40] the the deacons and trustees they worked
[57:42] so hard and and they work but everything
[57:45] just worked so seamless seamlessly you
[57:47] you know it just was like a well-oiled
[57:50] machine and you know just everything
[57:53] went from there all the way through the
[57:55] the plan the food preparations and and
[57:58] the the meal that we shared together the
[58:00] after uh after service snack bags that
[58:05] people could take home we do that
[58:07] because a lot of times there isn't
[58:09] anything open that that many people
[58:11] could go find something and so we do
[58:13] that so that it'll make it a little
[58:14] easier for them lift a burden and we we
[58:18] so appreciate the many who came and was
[58:21] a part of that meeting and you know we
[58:23] we just had the Servants of the Lord the
[58:26] ministry the musicians the the singers
[58:29] that served so well and did tremendously
[58:32] and I just want to say I am so proud of
[58:35] you amen you did so well I uh received
[58:39] this from Brother Kalin sing from South
[58:41] Africa and I thought he summed up the
[58:44] meetings for us pretty well and brother
[58:47] Kalin is some Minister friend of mine
[58:49] Pastor over there near Durbin somewhere
[58:53] hour or so away from there and has this
[58:56] little church there and we have been
[58:58] corresponding probably the last 10 15
[59:01] years and and that I've been in contact
[59:04] with him and um so you know we
[59:08] he listens into a lot of our services
[59:11] like right now today brother DeWitt from
[59:14] around Johannesburg is listening in the
[59:17] end God bless you brother DeWitt from
[59:19] evening like Tabernacle and may God
[59:21] restore Health to you and and also we we
[59:24] have men like brother Buzz Bosey that
[59:27] listens in from Uganda as a pastor there
[59:29] and also a pastor Singh there in the
[59:33] Durban area and many others that that
[59:36] listen in we hear regularly from Brother
[59:39] Wilson from another part around the Cape
[59:42] of South Africa so you know then then
[59:45] from different places from Denmark
[59:47] Sweden uh you know just around the world
[59:50] and so we we just want today to say we
[59:55] appreciate them and greet them but
[59:57] brother Kailyn kind of wrote after the
[59:59] the meetings and he kind of summed it up
[1:00:02] for me and he said
[1:00:03] all I can say is that evening light
[1:00:06] Tabernacle has waged War
[1:00:10] and he took the names Wayne Andrew and
[1:00:15] Ron and took the first letters of their
[1:00:17] name and it spells w-a-r-war
[1:00:20] and and of course I want you to know our
[1:00:23] war isn't against flesh and blood
[1:00:25] amen but it's against principalities and
[1:00:28] powers and spiritual wickedness in high
[1:00:31] places so you know it's we're nothing
[1:00:34] directed at any any of our brothers or
[1:00:36] sisters or friends or uh or anybody else
[1:00:40] or any other Church where our our enemy
[1:00:43] is the devil amen and so we we but we
[1:00:47] wage war and that's what we intended to
[1:00:49] do war on sin war on unbelief war on
[1:00:54] sickness war on every demon power we are
[1:00:58] here to wage war amen and we we have we
[1:01:02] have made the solemn act and declaration
[1:01:06] of war against the devil we're not
[1:01:09] having peace with him
[1:01:10] amen we're not giving up land for peace
[1:01:13] we're standing on that promise of God
[1:01:16] but um but he went on to say on the
[1:01:19] kingdom of hell that saw the bride
[1:01:22] realize that she is Anointed to accept
[1:01:25] what Eve turned down and what's these
[1:01:27] are sermon titles he said the bride
[1:01:29] realized he is Anointed to accept what
[1:01:32] he turned down this has made her cry out
[1:01:35] let's finish this for she is the
[1:01:38] anointed bright body of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:41] Christ and she is now feeling the effect
[1:01:43] of the vision as it Dawns on her that
[1:01:47] Satan is underestimated her for he
[1:01:50] cannot stop her from stepping into the
[1:01:53] mystery of the change
[1:01:56] amen I tell you what I I re I didn't
[1:01:59] think I could say it any better so I
[1:02:01] thought I'd just read what he said and
[1:02:02] he summed it up pretty well he goes on
[1:02:04] to say I truly believe the latter Glory
[1:02:07] of Eden and light Tabernacle be farther
[1:02:09] greater than the former you are truly an
[1:02:12] instrument of inspiration in the hand of
[1:02:14] the Lord to stir this Bride on into
[1:02:16] complete victory for that We Salute You
[1:02:19] amen so we so appreciate those words of
[1:02:22] encouragement from Brother Kalin today
[1:02:24] and also from Brother duet
[1:02:27] um and the eagle Ministry Tabernacle
[1:02:29] there and just believing that God who
[1:02:33] said I will restore will come by your
[1:02:35] way today with healing in his wings amen
[1:02:39] he's that kind of a God Amen aren't you
[1:02:42] glad to be serving the lord
[1:02:45] amen and just to know him and to have
[1:02:49] and experienced him and to have him in
[1:02:52] our presence is so so wonderful so we're
[1:02:56] looking today to the Lord to minister to
[1:02:58] us now we're going to go right onto the
[1:03:01] word now as we come close to the noon
[1:03:04] hour here in Louisiana and
[1:03:08] um as we begin to look in the scriptures
[1:03:11] we we are yes still dealing with the
[1:03:15] prophecy of Abraham
[1:03:17] and I'm I'm continuing to deal with this
[1:03:20] because remember
[1:03:22] um it's something that brother Branham
[1:03:24] would bring out almost every sermon and
[1:03:26] and preach entire series on
[1:03:29] and so I think it's worth us looking at
[1:03:31] and really taking a real uh in-depth
[1:03:36] thoughts about it because it is
[1:03:38] prophesying of the end time and what
[1:03:42] we're doing in this last day you see we
[1:03:44] see the Bible quite differently than
[1:03:47] others we see it as a prophecy
[1:03:51] and we we see ourselves in it and one
[1:03:55] service I'd like to just be able to take
[1:03:58] and and show you even the scriptures
[1:04:00] ever ever verse in the Bible speaks of
[1:04:04] Jesus Christ and so as we if it speaks
[1:04:08] of him then it also speaks of his work
[1:04:11] of redemption and you and so if you go
[1:04:15] and you read in the Bible and you miss
[1:04:18] seeing Christ in it go back and read it
[1:04:20] again he's there somewhere amen sister
[1:04:24] Bethany was telling me about uh
[1:04:26] listening to the
[1:04:28] um to all the the buildings of the
[1:04:30] Tabernacle and and the trapings and the
[1:04:33] you know just minute details of how that
[1:04:36] everything was to be and and all the
[1:04:39] anointing the clothes everything done in
[1:04:42] such a way and you know it it almost
[1:04:44] seems laborious but when you realize our
[1:04:48] God is a detailed God
[1:04:51] he seemed to ever detail of your life
[1:04:54] and so he doesn't just take up space in
[1:04:58] his Bible if he says something in his
[1:05:01] word it's for it was of course for them
[1:05:04] but it's even that that word of God
[1:05:06] continues living
[1:05:08] it's a Living Word so even though other
[1:05:11] Generations might have saw themselves in
[1:05:14] it it's written for you to see yourself
[1:05:16] in it
[1:05:17] so
[1:05:19] um today we're going to be be speaking
[1:05:23] on looking for Sarah because on the
[1:05:26] plains of memory here God came looking
[1:05:30] specifically now and he's looking for
[1:05:34] Sarah
[1:05:35] and and I want you to notice in this
[1:05:38] thing God comes his self if you notice
[1:05:42] this was the pre-incarnate Christ
[1:05:45] prefiguring what he would do in the last
[1:05:48] days and I love it when God takes
[1:05:51] personal interest in men's Affairs and I
[1:05:55] think God did that to us so much in our
[1:05:57] generation you know where he would tell
[1:06:00] names and addresses exactly where people
[1:06:04] lived exactly you know that the problem
[1:06:08] that they have and it was a God that
[1:06:11] could no ever detail of your life if he
[1:06:15] knew the past he would certainly know
[1:06:17] the present if he knows him present he
[1:06:19] certainly knows your future so it's a
[1:06:22] god that is a detailed God and here he
[1:06:25] comes down himself looking into the
[1:06:29] details
[1:06:30] he's looking for Sarah
[1:06:32] and and so this is again he has met with
[1:06:37] Abraham time after time but this time
[1:06:40] he's looking for Sarah where is Sarah
[1:06:43] thy wife so God has taken personal
[1:06:47] interests as I said I love it when he
[1:06:49] takes personal interest in man's Affair
[1:06:52] God didn't just send Angels looking for
[1:06:55] Sarah
[1:06:56] but although he was accompanied by them
[1:06:58] but he himself was looking for Sarah
[1:07:03] amen so God is present of course you
[1:07:07] know in the form of the Holy Ghost but
[1:07:09] angels are present also so when God
[1:07:12] comes looking you come in the form of
[1:07:15] the Holy Ghost but the angels of God are
[1:07:18] also here and they're also part but God
[1:07:21] comes himself notice we are here in the
[1:07:24] very finish and in the Finish God has
[1:07:28] not entrusted to finish with someone
[1:07:30] else he comes himself
[1:07:34] and you look at the anointing coming
[1:07:36] down of Revelation 10 it's a mighty
[1:07:40] angel
[1:07:41] and it's Christ coming down as his own
[1:07:44] messenger how could Christ be an angel
[1:07:47] he's not an angel but he is a messenger
[1:07:49] right so he comes as his own messenger
[1:07:53] he doesn't he doesn't come with an
[1:07:56] anointing of another angel or another
[1:08:00] this same anointing of of Gabriel and
[1:08:02] this is an anointing of wormwood or this
[1:08:05] is an Angelic anointing this is his own
[1:08:08] anointing and he comes down Christ as
[1:08:12] his own messenger and what he does he
[1:08:15] pledges himself
[1:08:17] amen he lifts his hand to heaven and
[1:08:19] swears by him that liveth forever and
[1:08:21] ever
[1:08:22] amen that I there's not going to be any
[1:08:25] more delay
[1:08:26] I've held things back but I'm no longer
[1:08:29] holding them back
[1:08:31] amen I I have waited for this day and
[1:08:34] for this time but now it is the hour to
[1:08:37] release
[1:08:39] to release all that I've held back for
[1:08:41] the end time I prophesied it in the
[1:08:44] scripture I've shown it in every verse
[1:08:47] I've identified it in the prophet's
[1:08:50] message but I tell you what I'm doing is
[1:08:52] that I am pledging myself amen I am
[1:08:56] standing as a guarantee
[1:08:59] swearing by his own self amen that I'm
[1:09:02] here to finish this work I'm here to
[1:09:05] perform what I said the word to do I'm
[1:09:09] not going to abandon the project amen I
[1:09:12] am not giving up on Heaven of Pride
[1:09:15] without spotter wrinkles I am looking
[1:09:18] for Sarah I am looking for that woman
[1:09:21] and I'm not going to leave her where I
[1:09:23] found her but I'm gonna change her
[1:09:26] to receive the promised son yeah
[1:09:31] so how does he come
[1:09:34] in Abraham's day he came in a tangible
[1:09:36] physical form
[1:09:38] manifesting God as a man
[1:09:42] but today he comes as a Holy Spirit
[1:09:45] and he uses flesh
[1:09:47] he uses the Flesh of redeemed men
[1:09:51] when he came and the fullness of his
[1:09:54] manifestation Abraham never got confused
[1:09:57] and made three Gods out of him
[1:09:59] neither did he tried to take away the
[1:10:01] deity of Christ and calling it two Lords
[1:10:04] let me say let me just say while we're
[1:10:06] here Jesus is not a lesser Lord
[1:10:09] he is the almighty God
[1:10:12] he is made was manifested in the body of
[1:10:16] the man of Christ Jesus Jesus is the
[1:10:19] only man that God will ever dwell in
[1:10:22] fully
[1:10:23] amen each one of us have the spirit of
[1:10:25] Christ by portion and remember the holy
[1:10:29] spirit is the spirit of Christ because
[1:10:31] he said if you don't have the spirit of
[1:10:33] Christ you're none of his
[1:10:35] so that's the Holy Spirit
[1:10:37] are you with me the very Spirit of Jesus
[1:10:40] a portion of him living in you shown
[1:10:44] them the day of Pentecost what did God
[1:10:46] do he divided himself
[1:10:49] and there he come in portions with every
[1:10:52] one of you to have a portion of deity a
[1:10:55] lick of fire in your own life
[1:10:57] hallelujah amen making together the
[1:11:01] fullness of the godhead bodily in a
[1:11:04] bright Lord
[1:11:05] Hallelujah amen now this was a calling
[1:11:10] forth of Sarah where is Sarah God came
[1:11:14] looking for her
[1:11:16] before he deals with son
[1:11:18] before he calls out what
[1:11:21] be he calls for sound and Sarah
[1:11:25] represents the bride and before the lot
[1:11:27] group goes into tribulation he comes
[1:11:30] looking for Sarah and before Sodom Burns
[1:11:33] and the Millennium comes when the world
[1:11:35] will be presence of sin he comes looking
[1:11:38] for Sarah because he must have a church
[1:11:42] ready to receive the promised son
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:48] now it works as Faith Express I want to
[1:11:52] just share with you this quote and I I
[1:11:55] just want to I want this to become real
[1:11:57] to you
[1:11:58] he says God and this is part of his
[1:12:01] prayer to the Pentecostal Church of this
[1:12:03] day
[1:12:04] the restoration of the gifts May Lord
[1:12:07] those men maybe some of them present
[1:12:09] here some of them hearing the tape
[1:12:11] around the world may they realize that
[1:12:14] this is the calling out of the Bride not
[1:12:17] a Pentecostal message the Pentecostal
[1:12:20] message was to restore the gifts back to
[1:12:23] the church but this is the calling forth
[1:12:26] of the Bride another message that was to
[1:12:29] come just before Sodom was to be burned
[1:12:33] let them understand Dear God
[1:12:36] now notice so this message is the
[1:12:40] calling forth of the Bride
[1:12:43] other messages did other things
[1:12:46] Luther's message brought justification
[1:12:49] Wesley's message brought sanctification
[1:12:53] you see that this is a Revival brought
[1:12:56] gifts and baptisms in the Holy Spirit
[1:12:59] but this message
[1:13:02] is looking for sound
[1:13:05] amen it is the calling forth of the
[1:13:08] bride and it is calling her forth to the
[1:13:12] original Pentecost
[1:13:14] Hallelujah God was saying to Sarah I am
[1:13:18] going to restore you
[1:13:20] all your loss
[1:13:22] everything you've missed
[1:13:25] the child you didn't have
[1:13:27] come on now the thing you've been
[1:13:29] waiting on the thing you've been bereft
[1:13:32] of
[1:13:34] I'm going to restore that to you
[1:13:36] and you're gonna you're gonna be like
[1:13:39] you were before your womb dried up
[1:13:42] before your milk Maids were gone and
[1:13:45] then before all of your your Youth and
[1:13:47] vitality was gone I'm going to restore
[1:13:50] you back to the way you were but this
[1:13:53] time I'm not taking my church and going
[1:13:55] down with it I'm going up with it
[1:13:59] [Applause]
[1:14:01] Hallelujah
[1:14:02] now I want you to know this is no Azusa
[1:14:07] Street Pentecostal message has that led
[1:14:10] to organization it did not direct the
[1:14:13] people to become a virgin bride this
[1:14:16] message is to take the Barren Church
[1:14:19] and fill it with life and impregnate her
[1:14:23] with a long-awaited promised son
[1:14:26] Jesus Christ will be formed in the
[1:14:29] bright body and then that bright people
[1:14:32] will bring Jesus for that meeting in the
[1:14:35] air
[1:14:36] now this calling Boards of the bride was
[1:14:39] brother Brandon was speaking of is the
[1:14:42] original Pentecost
[1:14:45] the original Pentecostal message and not
[1:14:49] something different
[1:14:51] it is the same grain that was planted at
[1:14:54] Pentecost coming back to seed again
[1:14:58] you see it and of course you know to do
[1:15:02] that to come to see it means we've got
[1:15:04] to bake all the greenness out of us
[1:15:07] amen amen it means that the immaturity
[1:15:11] of the ages is baked out and now they
[1:15:14] and then and the grain is now mature as
[1:15:19] it was at Pentecost
[1:15:21] partial word has given way to the
[1:15:24] fullness of the word
[1:15:26] dips of the spirit has given way to the
[1:15:29] fullness of the Holy Ghost it is the
[1:15:32] word in power
[1:15:34] now as we're looking at this you see
[1:15:38] there's a lot of misunderstandings today
[1:15:41] when it comes to this
[1:15:43] and to some laying in the presence of
[1:15:46] the sun means no shouting
[1:15:49] no no emotion you know it's all dry no
[1:15:52] Revival no gifts of the Spirit no
[1:15:56] movement of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:58] it's the word now and it's supposed to
[1:16:00] be dry
[1:16:01] oh yes and for years have said it's
[1:16:04] immature to shout only babies do that
[1:16:07] it's immature to speak with Toms
[1:16:10] you know with the perfect word and with
[1:16:13] the full light it just burns all that
[1:16:15] old immaturity out but I want you to
[1:16:18] know it's not immaturity to speak in
[1:16:20] tongues and prophesy and to have gifts
[1:16:23] of the Spirit you can't be mature and
[1:16:26] complete without it it is not immature
[1:16:29] to shout
[1:16:30] the mature church will shout will
[1:16:34] rejoice and will laugh at the prospect
[1:16:37] of the promised son it is a mature
[1:16:40] Church who has healings at Miracles and
[1:16:43] signs and wonders
[1:16:46] Hallelujah I stopped at him Azusa
[1:16:50] Pentecostals are immature because they
[1:16:52] had gifts and spoke with tongues no they
[1:16:55] had matured past the lutherans
[1:16:57] you see before Pastor Lutheran stopped
[1:17:01] they had matured and the Methodist
[1:17:03] pollen to be able to speak with tongues
[1:17:05] that were more mature
[1:17:08] come on somebody that wasn't less mature
[1:17:10] that were more mature because they were
[1:17:13] more mature they spoke in other tongues
[1:17:15] and had gifts of the Spirit
[1:17:17] amen now what makes them Pentecostal
[1:17:20] babies is because you can't teach them
[1:17:23] Supernatural things
[1:17:25] you see they're immature because they
[1:17:27] jump up and down like a kid doing that
[1:17:30] to try and speak with tongues and
[1:17:32] refusing to walk in all the work
[1:17:35] amen that makes some babies but true and
[1:17:39] maturity and rightness is not a dry
[1:17:43] formal religion
[1:17:45] I mean that's a description of the dry
[1:17:48] dead blade tussle and Chuck
[1:17:52] but the life is in the grave
[1:17:58] now making the greenness and the
[1:18:00] immaturity out doesn't take away the
[1:18:02] power of God and signs and wonders
[1:18:05] amen making the greenness outbreaks that
[1:18:09] amen because she becomes the fullness of
[1:18:12] what she was at Pentecost which she was
[1:18:14] mature come on any Ministry without
[1:18:17] Divine Healing miracles signs and
[1:18:20] wonders is a green Ministry
[1:18:25] I'm not saying you're not grain now
[1:18:28] I'm saying you're immature
[1:18:31] a mature ministry will have the power of
[1:18:34] the resurrecting Christ in it
[1:18:36] a mature church will have gifts of the
[1:18:39] Spirit in it and the church church will
[1:18:41] have holy ghost power a mature church
[1:18:44] will have Divine Healing a mature church
[1:18:47] can be taught Supernatural things
[1:18:57] without causing carnal comparisons
[1:19:02] well
[1:19:04] my brother Tim this is the grain now and
[1:19:07] we we ain't nothing like
[1:19:09] we ain't nothing like the mezuzah bunch
[1:19:12] why was it
[1:19:15] you know we said well nothing like them
[1:19:17] Chuck out there we're just nothing like
[1:19:18] that well why was it then the prophet
[1:19:20] told us repetitively that the shuck
[1:19:23] looked so much like the grain
[1:19:25] that it would deceive the elect if it
[1:19:27] were possible
[1:19:33] hmm
[1:19:36] the shop looked so much like the real
[1:19:38] thing
[1:19:40] well we don't want to be like that they
[1:19:41] look more real than what baptism
[1:19:43] methodists
[1:19:45] message churches do
[1:19:49] amen they're a little bit closer up the
[1:19:51] ladder than what them are down in the
[1:19:54] past they're a little more mature
[1:19:56] somebody help me preach
[1:19:58] you see the grain is the full word and
[1:20:02] since every gift of the spirit comes
[1:20:05] interpretation prophecy healing Miracles
[1:20:08] Faith all of that that is listed in the
[1:20:11] Bible so since that is a part of the
[1:20:13] word then that's in the grave
[1:20:19] now in the Masterpiece message brother
[1:20:22] random said
[1:20:23] at the Harvest Time the seed is back in
[1:20:27] its original condition and you must have
[1:20:30] all the word in order to be seed
[1:20:32] somebody say all the word
[1:20:34] we got an open book
[1:20:36] there's none of it closed healing's not
[1:20:39] close to us Miracles does not close
[1:20:41] mysteries of God is not closed seven
[1:20:44] Thunders are not closed
[1:20:46] amen listen none of it's close to us
[1:20:50] it's all open to us so you see to the
[1:20:53] seed to the seed is back in its original
[1:20:56] condition and must have all the words
[1:20:59] in order to be the seed
[1:21:02] now you can't have half a seed it won't
[1:21:05] grow
[1:21:06] she has got to be the whole seed see
[1:21:09] that's why we're preaching a Full Gospel
[1:21:11] an open book
[1:21:14] none of it's closed
[1:21:16] amen it's got to be the whole seed it's
[1:21:18] got a man if I say I believe in the
[1:21:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I
[1:21:23] believe in speaking in tongues he said
[1:21:24] that's just part of the seed
[1:21:26] uh-huh but now there's added to that see
[1:21:29] see the life not just not the gifts the
[1:21:32] life of the gifts see what I mean we are
[1:21:35] at the end time brother so we have more
[1:21:37] than just gifts although that's part of
[1:21:40] the sea
[1:21:41] I just read it to you it's part of the
[1:21:44] sea but we got more than that because we
[1:21:45] got the life the personal presence of
[1:21:48] Christ the Holy Ghost himself
[1:21:52] who's appearing to Sarah here not an
[1:21:55] angel not not a secondary God Amen but
[1:21:58] God himself coming down
[1:22:03] now
[1:22:05] so brother Tim well we got the life not
[1:22:07] the gifts
[1:22:08] well you know people have used that you
[1:22:12] know to do away with the gifts of the
[1:22:14] Spirit you know that's like Rebecca
[1:22:16] reviews and the gifts of Isaac to become
[1:22:18] his bride
[1:22:20] you can't do that you can't refuse the
[1:22:23] engagement ringing and the things that
[1:22:25] identify you as bright these signs shall
[1:22:28] follow them that believe
[1:22:30] while other women wear jewelry too they
[1:22:33] got signs and wonders too listen but
[1:22:35] you've got to have it to be the bride of
[1:22:38] Christ if your believer's side follow
[1:22:40] the believer
[1:22:47] what shall I do with this Jesus called
[1:22:49] Christ he says what sinful man could
[1:22:52] there be today that could look in the
[1:22:54] face of the Bible and see if the Holy
[1:22:57] Spirit isn't The Interpreter of the word
[1:22:59] today making himself known by
[1:23:01] manifestations the promises of the gifts
[1:23:03] and things that he promised to do in
[1:23:05] this day Malachi 4 being fulfilled and
[1:23:09] all the rest of the scripture being
[1:23:10] fulfilled see it right here at the end
[1:23:13] time you don't need any man to interpret
[1:23:15] it it interprets itself it proves it's
[1:23:18] the message of the hour
[1:23:21] again and he would tell us and if God be
[1:23:25] with us where are the Miracles and he
[1:23:28] said if God be God where is his miracles
[1:23:32] if God's with us where is his miracles
[1:23:36] if God is with the Methodist Church why
[1:23:39] is the women wearing bobbed hair
[1:23:41] if God is with the Baptist Church why
[1:23:44] does the pastor still smoke cigarettes
[1:23:47] many of them why do they deny the power
[1:23:50] of God to heal the sick reads the dead
[1:23:52] and speak in tongues and interpret
[1:23:54] tongues and give some prophecy why do
[1:23:57] they still deny it is it God of the Old
[1:23:59] Testament the god of the new is still
[1:24:00] the same God
[1:24:03] so you said if God is with us
[1:24:06] if this is his appearing if this is
[1:24:09] Christ among us then where is miracles
[1:24:17] and we're declaring Christ is Among Us
[1:24:20] and so are his miracles
[1:24:24] hallelujah it's time that people wake up
[1:24:27] and see the hour and turn the corner
[1:24:29] from the past ages and become the bride
[1:24:31] she was at Pentecost
[1:24:33] get focused it's truly a serious time
[1:24:37] you don't listen this message came by
[1:24:40] the Supernatural and the only way this
[1:24:43] bride is raptured before the tribulation
[1:24:45] is by the supernatural
[1:24:48] so she's got to be a supernatural Church
[1:24:52] brother Branham told us he said that she
[1:24:54] nears him she will be a super Church
[1:24:59] amen I believe we are a super race
[1:25:02] a super Church
[1:25:05] come on now
[1:25:07] now so again time for people to wake up
[1:25:11] that's what the Seven Wonders were to do
[1:25:13] they were to wake the bride to the
[1:25:17] reality of the supernatural God as his
[1:25:21] voice uttered by seven angels to the
[1:25:24] prophet
[1:25:25] that was Supernatural
[1:25:27] it was no intellectual Revival that
[1:25:30] awoke the bride and I'll just tell you
[1:25:32] no intellectual Revival today will await
[1:25:36] the bride no seminars no intellectual
[1:25:39] teaching come on it'll take the
[1:25:41] anointing power
[1:25:43] Supernatural gospel Amen to bring the
[1:25:47] bride to awaken to who she is
[1:25:52] where are you Sarah you need an
[1:25:54] Awakening
[1:25:56] that this is your hour this is your time
[1:25:59] brother Branham himself realized that
[1:26:01] people were receiving it intellectually
[1:26:04] instead of laying in the presence of God
[1:26:06] and it ripened in their faith
[1:26:09] amen that you know Faith ought to be
[1:26:11] ripened healing ought to be ripened
[1:26:14] salvation ought to be ripened
[1:26:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost shouldn't be
[1:26:19] just a dip in the spirit and you dance
[1:26:22] and get it on your spirit realm and
[1:26:24] never on the soul amen it ought to be
[1:26:27] laying in the presence of the sun
[1:26:28] ripening bringing to maturity faith
[1:26:34] the power of God the mysteries of God
[1:26:37] come on it's not intellectual it is a
[1:26:42] supernatural Revival
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:46] amen now
[1:26:48] notice this dating in 1965 11 28 God's
[1:26:53] only provided place of worship
[1:26:55] he says I believe the church is
[1:26:58] beginning to hear the message
[1:27:00] I'm beginning to understand it now he's
[1:27:03] just described in in pretext here
[1:27:07] um in context of this he just described
[1:27:09] it going beyond the curtain of time a
[1:27:12] supernatural event
[1:27:14] and he says I believe the churches are
[1:27:16] beginning to hear the message and
[1:27:19] beginning to understand it
[1:27:21] but friend listen we got to lay in the
[1:27:24] presence of the sun we've got to be
[1:27:25] ripened
[1:27:27] our faith isn't ripe
[1:27:30] intellectually we're hearing the message
[1:27:32] God gave us and seeing the signs he's so
[1:27:36] disproving it by the Bible it's there
[1:27:38] but oh how the church needs to lay in
[1:27:41] the present till it tenders up you know
[1:27:43] and gets sweet in the spirit so he can
[1:27:46] just bathe down
[1:27:48] something sometimes in speaking the
[1:27:50] message you get hard and you have to
[1:27:52] break it in like that because you've got
[1:27:54] to clench a nail to make it whole but
[1:27:56] when the church once gets it and the
[1:27:59] election is called out and separated
[1:28:01] then in the presence of God I know it'll
[1:28:04] be like the people was there referring
[1:28:07] to the curtain of time when it takes its
[1:28:11] Rapture away what was there was this is
[1:28:14] divine love this is the Holy Ghost so
[1:28:17] there's got to be a church walking in
[1:28:20] the fullness of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:23] something more that is intellectual
[1:28:26] Revival
[1:28:27] but the people walking in the power of
[1:28:30] God
[1:28:32] now
[1:28:33] let me just remind you of a
[1:28:37] of a phrase that my good friend who's
[1:28:39] now going to be to Glory brother
[1:28:42] Hildebrandt would say this message can't
[1:28:46] be passed on intellectually
[1:28:53] you know today
[1:28:55] sometimes you know we we think we're
[1:28:57] going to get it by study
[1:29:00] and that's the way that it's going to be
[1:29:02] if if we can just study study it all and
[1:29:05] get it all you know get it all figured
[1:29:07] out and you know just study it all and
[1:29:10] get it lined up well let me tell you
[1:29:12] that's man anointing
[1:29:15] it was man anointing under Luther that
[1:29:19] was calling for that kind of study
[1:29:22] but I want you to know this is an eagle
[1:29:24] anointing
[1:29:25] and it doesn't come by study
[1:29:28] it comes my experience with God
[1:29:32] breaking out of earth-bound conditions
[1:29:34] into Realms where all things are
[1:29:36] possible
[1:29:37] amen today we have wanted to dress the
[1:29:41] church up a little bit and refine it
[1:29:45] you know we want to we want to learn
[1:29:48] Behavior
[1:29:49] you know we have to teach a man to love
[1:29:52] his wife
[1:29:54] well brother if I got to teach you to
[1:29:56] love your wife there's something wrong
[1:29:59] if there isn't that love in your heart
[1:30:01] for your life I don't know all the
[1:30:03] teaching that I do is going to do it
[1:30:08] I didn't have to teach you to love her
[1:30:09] when she was your girlfriend
[1:30:13] did I you don't have to have seminars
[1:30:16] for me to teach you to love your wife or
[1:30:18] your girlfriend now you're supposed to
[1:30:21] love her now hey boy you're supposed to
[1:30:23] love her you don't buy her nice things
[1:30:25] make her happy take her out get her
[1:30:27] something to eat you know have a good
[1:30:28] time with it communicate
[1:30:32] I didn't have to teach that
[1:30:34] and I tell you you get men and women
[1:30:36] filled with the Holy Ghost you ain't
[1:30:38] gonna have to teach them to love their
[1:30:39] wife or a woman to obey her husband
[1:30:44] come on Amen especially when the Holy
[1:30:47] Ghost is anoint the word in your life
[1:30:49] it's gonna Quicken it and it ain't gonna
[1:30:52] be some counseling service out here in
[1:30:55] the back more that you learn that is not
[1:30:57] a learned behavior it becomes
[1:31:00] automatically
[1:31:02] why did I even make you love your enemy
[1:31:05] let alone your wife or husband
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:12] now you know I I just want to say Godly
[1:31:15] instruction is good but that's all law
[1:31:18] you don't do this don't do that
[1:31:20] you know I'm going to give you this
[1:31:22] formula and I'll try this check this out
[1:31:25] send the Roses on her birthday and you
[1:31:28] know what she finds out I told you that
[1:31:29] she'll throw them roses back in your
[1:31:31] face
[1:31:36] if she finds out that was just something
[1:31:39] that was you know told to do somebody
[1:31:42] had to tell him to do that and he didn't
[1:31:44] come back from her heart
[1:31:46] from his heart
[1:31:48] she gonna throw that back in your face
[1:31:49] she don't want them roses
[1:31:52] cause brother Tim told you to get her
[1:31:54] son
[1:31:56] right
[1:31:57] amen she wants it because there's a Love
[1:31:59] in Your Heart A care that is there
[1:32:01] somebody with me today
[1:32:04] amen so you see you you know that's a
[1:32:07] whole thing it's it's not something that
[1:32:09] is learned the Holy Ghost is not a
[1:32:12] learned behavior
[1:32:13] I'm going to learn not to look at
[1:32:16] pornography so much and we're going to
[1:32:19] learn I'm going to teach you how a
[1:32:21] certain steps you know you take you know
[1:32:23] and and this is how that you know you
[1:32:25] treat the finances God gave you and and
[1:32:28] I I'm going to do all that listen that
[1:32:30] is not the gospel
[1:32:33] the gospel is the power of God under
[1:32:36] salvation
[1:32:38] amen you said well brother Tim we we
[1:32:41] need to teach our people how to manage
[1:32:43] their money how to manage their finances
[1:32:46] well I I admit sometimes Godly
[1:32:49] instruction can be appropriate but what
[1:32:51] we really need
[1:32:53] you want to hear it what we really need
[1:32:56] is the Holy Ghost
[1:32:58] that blasts out sin
[1:33:01] and takes greed out of our lives and
[1:33:05] holy ghost power that keeps envy and
[1:33:08] Covetous now and what that until
[1:33:10] whatever state you find yourself in that
[1:33:13] way if you are content
[1:33:15] that gain is not godliness but godliness
[1:33:19] with contempt is great gain
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:23] it comes by the Holy Ghost
[1:33:27] that's cause you get in love with Jesus
[1:33:29] you ain't greedy no more from filthy
[1:33:31] Luca she ain't chasing the dollar
[1:33:34] everywhere and you're not running up
[1:33:36] your credit cards and living beyond your
[1:33:38] means
[1:33:40] you're not trying to keep up with the
[1:33:42] Joneses because of your covetousness
[1:33:46] good dose of the Holy Ghost secure that
[1:33:49] amen it'll make you content with such
[1:33:52] things as you have
[1:33:54] it may give your joy and the Lord
[1:33:57] instead of things
[1:33:58] you quit being Leo to see you trying to
[1:34:01] be rich and increase with goods and
[1:34:03] don't have need of God he's pushed out
[1:34:05] of your life
[1:34:10] you see the calling forth of the Bride
[1:34:12] is not an intellectual Revival it's a
[1:34:14] supernatural and it's power
[1:34:17] its power is not even learned behavior
[1:34:21] its power is in a changed life
[1:34:24] it is not a Reformation
[1:34:27] and that's the problem we're still
[1:34:29] trying to reform people you don't do
[1:34:32] that you don't do that you treat your
[1:34:34] wife this way and you treat your
[1:34:35] children this way and you do this and
[1:34:37] you do that you pay your ties and you
[1:34:39] come to church you're trying to reform
[1:34:40] them get the transforming power of the
[1:34:45] Holy Ghost and make a new creature out
[1:34:47] of them and to change their attitudes
[1:34:55] well
[1:34:58] anyway
[1:35:00] educating people into Bible truths is
[1:35:03] not the gospel
[1:35:05] the gospel is the power of God in the
[1:35:08] men's hearts that gives an attitude and
[1:35:12] a hunger for truth an appetite an
[1:35:17] attitude and hunger
[1:35:19] you see you see that's what God
[1:35:22] that that's what God is into this mouse
[1:35:25] that we're in is the first age started
[1:35:29] drifting
[1:35:30] and they started drifting you know by
[1:35:32] trying to dress the gospel up to make it
[1:35:36] appealing to their bosses and the rich
[1:35:39] man and whatever hasn't met in these
[1:35:41] little dim-ledded places
[1:35:43] and the Holy Spirit was replaced with
[1:35:46] intellectual conception
[1:35:48] divine revelation was replaced by
[1:35:51] educating people by knowledge
[1:35:55] and the the gospel became knowledge
[1:35:57] based instead of spirit based
[1:36:02] now in Moses day this is what it got
[1:36:05] Israel out of their Homeland
[1:36:07] all the way back to the time of Joseph
[1:36:09] you see the people didn't want the
[1:36:12] supernatural they saw Joseph a man who
[1:36:15] had dreams and visions and the voice of
[1:36:18] God was speaking to him and you can see
[1:36:20] the favor was upon his life and out of
[1:36:23] jealousy
[1:36:25] they sold him
[1:36:29] amen I I just say you know if you see
[1:36:33] the the hand of God in somebody's life
[1:36:35] don't don't don't try to be envious of
[1:36:39] them and jealous and stop it
[1:36:42] amen do everything you can join with it
[1:36:45] if this got him out of their promised
[1:36:47] land it's wind up getting them all the
[1:36:49] way down to Egypt of course God had a
[1:36:52] plan yes God had Provisions God made a
[1:36:55] way instead of all of the awful
[1:36:57] jealousies and everything that went on
[1:36:59] now so in Moses day that got him out
[1:37:02] they thought the Brethren that they
[1:37:04] would never have need for a man like
[1:37:06] that
[1:37:07] so why not just get rid of it I'm
[1:37:09] quoting now from Third Exodus he said
[1:37:12] that's what I same things happen today
[1:37:14] they because they think that because our
[1:37:17] churches has become an Alexa
[1:37:19] but that we got the best dress crowds
[1:37:22] the biggest organization the smartest
[1:37:25] ministers that we have no use for the
[1:37:28] holy spirit in the way it was back there
[1:37:31] that they are full in other words
[1:37:33] actions speak louder than words that
[1:37:35] they're seminaries and the brain of
[1:37:37] their being and they're coming together
[1:37:39] and discussing and standing are more
[1:37:41] able with their intellectual Minds to
[1:37:44] set a church in order better than what
[1:37:46] the Holy Spirit could do it they don't
[1:37:49] need it any longer it's something we
[1:37:50] don't need today the days of that has
[1:37:53] passed is that right we don't need the
[1:37:55] Holy Spirit to heal the sick we got
[1:37:57] doctors we don't need Holy Spirit to
[1:38:00] speak with tongues we're all intelligent
[1:38:02] people and when you do you take right
[1:38:04] from your framework the lifeline Jesus
[1:38:08] said to them Jews in this day having to
[1:38:11] read that the stone that was rejected is
[1:38:14] the Chief Cornerstone that all the
[1:38:16] building is set upon
[1:38:19] you see this is exactly where brother
[1:38:21] Branham was when when the the Seven
[1:38:23] Angels Came to him he came reopened the
[1:38:26] Bible to their work there was a Chief
[1:38:29] Cornerstone it was a stone of stumbling
[1:38:32] and a rock of offense
[1:38:34] but God was restoring the Capstone back
[1:38:37] to the church bringing up to completion
[1:38:40] amen that's what the seven Thunders do
[1:38:43] that's what the mysteries of God are to
[1:38:45] do is to bring you into maturity
[1:38:49] amen but God said But as God said to
[1:38:51] that Baron Sarah you know that she will
[1:38:55] be restored so he uses Israel now to
[1:38:59] that he brought out of Egypt to prophesy
[1:39:02] to us that God will restore
[1:39:06] Hallelujah in other words they're out of
[1:39:10] their land they got down there for the
[1:39:13] jealousy of the brothers they went into
[1:39:15] intellectualism but I will restore I'm
[1:39:18] going to bring it back
[1:39:20] by the supernatural
[1:39:23] it was not an intellectual Revival by
[1:39:27] the way that Moses brought the children
[1:39:30] of Israel out of Egypt it was by the
[1:39:33] supernatural
[1:39:34] it was by raining down pledge of Satan's
[1:39:39] kingdom
[1:39:40] come on he had Afflicted them enough now
[1:39:43] it was the devil's turn to be uplifted
[1:39:46] I'm going to tell you we've been
[1:39:48] Afflicted enough it's the devil's turn
[1:39:52] Hallelujah there's got to be a people
[1:39:55] that take the word and put it in their
[1:39:57] mouth and call flies down call please
[1:40:02] dial until the enemy says get out take
[1:40:06] your rapture and go
[1:40:11] praise the Lord
[1:40:13] now
[1:40:15] so God
[1:40:18] is what prophesies to us
[1:40:21] that in a day like this
[1:40:23] of Doom and Gloom and darkness that it
[1:40:27] shall be lied in the evening time
[1:40:30] and with the power of the light of that
[1:40:32] word the Bright Tree will bloom again

[1:45:41] stage as he's got it now and we see the
[1:45:44] words of being manifested what is it is
[1:45:46] a perfect Vindication that the coming of
[1:45:49] the Lord is at hand and the time that he
[1:45:52] said I will restore it saith the Lord

[1:46:08] well brother Tim we got all the Mystic
[1:46:11] troops restored
[1:46:13] we got it well let me just say about
[1:46:15] Doctrine Doctrine is not supposed to be
[1:46:18] dry informal
[1:46:20] and make Eggheads out of us
[1:46:24] return comes as the Holy Spirit
[1:46:29] come on the Apostle Paul put this
[1:46:31] scripture up First Corinthians 2 1 and I
[1:46:34] Brethren when I came to you now he was
[1:46:37] an egghead Pharisee of the Pharisees he
[1:46:40] had knowledge above them all he could
[1:46:42] have defined the law and why and where
[1:46:44] and how and all it comes and he was a
[1:46:47] Pharisee of the Pharisee but I came not
[1:46:50] with all my knowledge and Excellency of
[1:46:53] speech of my wisdom declaring to you the
[1:46:55] testimony of God that's not how I
[1:46:57] witness this gospel
[1:46:59] I didn't come and say well I'll tell you
[1:47:01] what you know I know more than the rest
[1:47:03] of you and I've been in this longer and
[1:47:05] I've got all the Mysteries down and
[1:47:07] everybody sit down and listen to me
[1:47:09] that's not what he said I came to
[1:47:11] Clarity you the testimony of God for I
[1:47:13] determined not to know anything among
[1:47:16] you but Jesus Christ saved Jesus Christ
[1:47:20] and him crucified
[1:47:23] this is what I wanted you to know I knew
[1:47:26] that I had met Jesus
[1:47:29] Hallelujah and I was with you in
[1:47:32] weakness and in fear and much trembling
[1:47:34] and my testimony and my preaching was
[1:47:37] not with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[1:47:40] but
[1:47:41] but
[1:47:43] in demonstration of the spirit and Power
[1:47:47] that your faith should not rest or stand
[1:47:51] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:47:54] God that's where I want your faith
[1:47:58] amen that it's in the power of God
[1:48:02] our faith is not to be in well I know
[1:48:04] what the Thunders are and I know what
[1:48:06] serpent seed is and I know so therefore
[1:48:08] I got the Holy Ghost no you've got to
[1:48:10] know the power of God your faith cannot
[1:48:13] rest in knowing and understanding all
[1:48:16] the Mysteries
[1:48:19] you're just as much as those depends on
[1:48:21] tongues you're just sound embracing Tim
[1:48:23] tickling symbols
[1:48:25] amen but you see your light your faith
[1:48:28] is going to rest in the power of God
[1:48:31] Amen in first Thessalonians 1 and 5 for
[1:48:34] Our Gospel came not unto you in word
[1:48:37] only
[1:48:38] somebody say word only
[1:48:40] amen but also in power
[1:48:42] and in the Holy Ghost and in much
[1:48:45] assurance
[1:48:48] that's how the gospel came
[1:48:50] it didn't come in word only
[1:48:53] well we're a word bribe brother Tim
[1:48:55] we're word word word word word word word
[1:48:57] is a person it's a Holy Ghost
[1:49:01] it's not a message book it's not even a
[1:49:04] it's not even the Bible yes the Bible
[1:49:06] contains the word of God it's in written
[1:49:08] form I get that not denying that
[1:49:11] but that's not who the word before there
[1:49:14] was a Bible that was the word
[1:49:16] before there was a sermon but printed of
[1:49:19] brother Branham there was the word
[1:49:21] [Applause]
[1:49:23] come on and the Word was with God and
[1:49:27] the Word was God and it's the same holy
[1:49:30] ghost that we got today and when you get
[1:49:33] the Holy Ghost then you got the word not
[1:49:36] when you get intellectual learning but
[1:49:38] when you get the Holy Ghost then you the
[1:49:41] word
[1:49:43] got it backwards
[1:49:48] now
[1:49:49] Second Coming 1955 I know this 55 quote
[1:49:53] some people makes a difference to them
[1:49:55] but you can go uh you know I'm just
[1:49:58] going to say well this was when he was a
[1:50:00] prophet
[1:50:06] so when he was a prophet he said this
[1:50:09] the gospel is not going out and teaching
[1:50:11] the Bible by the way
[1:50:13] all of this can be found in other quotes
[1:50:15] after 63 6 all the way to 65. the gospel
[1:50:19] is not going out and teaching the Bible
[1:50:21] that isn't the gospel
[1:50:23] it is written in the scripture that the
[1:50:25] gospel didn't come through just the word
[1:50:27] only but through the power and
[1:50:30] demonstrations of the Holy Spirit The
[1:50:32] Gospel that is the word but the letter
[1:50:35] Kenneth the spirit-giveth life now a
[1:50:38] seed laying there laying here on the
[1:50:41] pulpit is just a seed until it dies and
[1:50:44] becomes germanized and dies it'll never
[1:50:47] do any anything so the seed the word has
[1:50:50] to be made manifest in order to be the
[1:50:53] gospel
[1:50:55] uh-huh it said in the beginning was the
[1:50:57] word the word was with God the Word was
[1:50:59] God not depending on what the word was a
[1:51:02] word is the expression of a thought it
[1:51:04] has to be a thought before it can be a
[1:51:05] word so God in the beginning gave the
[1:51:08] thought of what it would be spoke the
[1:51:10] word for it to be we received the word
[1:51:13] and it produces what God thought it was
[1:51:15] the word is the gospel in seed form
[1:51:20] now if you ask me he said brother
[1:51:21] Brandon your country they have acorn
[1:51:23] trees that's an oak tree in case you
[1:51:25] don't know but if you would you give me
[1:51:28] an acre tree he said I'll give you an
[1:51:30] apron
[1:51:31] and I give you an acre you have an acorn
[1:51:34] tree potentially but it's in seed form
[1:51:38] you can't say absolutely you got it free
[1:51:42] until the seed has produced a tree
[1:51:46] well the preaching
[1:51:48] uh preaching the word is the acorn but
[1:51:51] making it live is the gospel
[1:51:54] that's right if he promised the Holy
[1:51:56] Spirit that's the word and receiving the
[1:52:00] holy spirit is making it live manifested
[1:52:03] if he promises Blessings by the word
[1:52:05] then accepting the word and producing
[1:52:07] what he said is the gospel going into
[1:52:10] all the world preach the gospel of every
[1:52:11] creature the next line is proof that
[1:52:14] just teaching the word wouldn't do it he
[1:52:16] said these signs have followed them that
[1:52:18] believe in my name they will cast out
[1:52:20] Devils evil spirits speak with new
[1:52:22] tongues take up servants drink the
[1:52:24] deadly things it would not harm them lay
[1:52:26] their hands on the sick they shall
[1:52:27] recover and now that's the gospel and
[1:52:31] Theology and teaching has substituted
[1:52:34] its place
[1:52:36] so you're not even teaching truly
[1:52:38] teaching the gospel or preaching the
[1:52:41] gospel unless it's manifested
[1:52:44] amen as Peter said in second Peter 1 21
[1:52:47] for the prophecy came not in Old Time by
[1:52:51] the will of man
[1:52:52] you see the prophets didn't think these
[1:52:54] things up
[1:52:56] amen they wasn't on their own this was
[1:52:58] not their intellect
[1:53:00] they had no right to ask for
[1:53:03] intellectual property rights
[1:53:08] come on but holy men spit of God spake
[1:53:13] as they were moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:53:16] you see the mysteries of God that has
[1:53:20] been revealed to us I want you to
[1:53:22] understand it is not man's studied
[1:53:24] opinion
[1:53:26] it comes from the realm of the
[1:53:29] supernatural
[1:53:30] and when the seals were open night after
[1:53:33] night they were revealed by the angel of
[1:53:36] God
[1:53:38] amen
[1:53:40] now sure study has its place
[1:53:44] Paul admonished us to study to show
[1:53:47] ourselves a Workman that needeth not to
[1:53:49] be ashamed
[1:53:50] you said you read your Bible you should
[1:53:52] listen to tapes you should you should
[1:53:54] study to the word of God but it but
[1:53:57] remember it don't take ordinary study
[1:54:00] and thinking to make the book real
[1:54:02] it takes the operation of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:05] and that means it cannot be revealed
[1:54:08] itself to a special class of people who
[1:54:11] have the Holy Ghost
[1:54:12] amen so it'll take then then that
[1:54:15] because when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:54:17] your birthed into the Supernatural and
[1:54:20] it gives you a prophetic insight
[1:54:22] and it requires an ability to hear from
[1:54:26] God
[1:54:27] and it requires Supernatural instruction
[1:54:29] not just a student comparing verse with
[1:54:32] verse though that's good but a mystery
[1:54:35] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:54:39] it never becomes clear
[1:54:42] how we need to hear from God and lay
[1:54:45] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:54:47] spirit to hear and know
[1:54:51] now that's why we need more than study
[1:54:56] we need an outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:02] the message I'm just going to say some
[1:55:04] things here the message has been studied
[1:55:07] and tinkered with
[1:55:10] men have added their own ideas and
[1:55:13] opinions to it until the car that
[1:55:15] brother Branham left running that would
[1:55:18] drive down to the power of God that took
[1:55:21] away sin desire
[1:55:23] amen we're told it it don't do that no
[1:55:26] more
[1:55:27] you don't have that kind of experience
[1:55:29] that takes away sin desires you know you
[1:55:32] just kind of got to grow into some kind
[1:55:34] of token life out here somewhere that
[1:55:36] that held out like a carrot in front of
[1:55:39] a goats that you never get
[1:55:41] because you're not going to get it that
[1:55:43] way it comes by birth it comes by the
[1:55:46] burden of sin out of your life
[1:55:49] amen that's right
[1:55:53] sure you grow in the life of God I'm not
[1:55:55] trying to do it away with that but what
[1:55:57] I'm saying is you've got to have that
[1:56:00] birth that cleanses sin out of life
[1:56:04] it's not something you're just going to
[1:56:06] get over
[1:56:07] it's something that's got to be dealt

[1:56:36] for my health it's not going to be good
[1:56:37] for marriages it's not good for my home
[1:56:39] it's got to be more than that it's got
[1:56:42] to be a I hate sin
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:46] amen my desires have to be changed I
[1:56:49] don't want it no more
[1:56:51] this is not a a-conscious
[1:56:56] well we take this step and this step
[1:56:58] we're going to grow into where we don't
[1:57:00] drink alcohol no more that that
[1:57:03] you'll fall off the wagon doing that
[1:57:05] you'll be always there tempted on every
[1:57:07] hand you know I still the desire is
[1:57:10] there
[1:57:11] but if God ever Burns that sin desire
[1:57:14] out of your life you won't want that
[1:57:19] old things have passed away and behold
[1:57:22] All Things become new
[1:57:25] are you with me amen but we you know we
[1:57:28] we again you know today we we would we
[1:57:33] had a car that was left running that
[1:57:35] would drive down to the power of the
[1:57:37] blood that took away sin desires you
[1:57:40] know we're we're told that we God don't
[1:57:43] do it that way no more we just need to
[1:57:45] Tinker with it some more and one day
[1:57:47] hope will grow out of our sins
[1:57:52] you know that car would would drive down
[1:57:55] to Divine Healing
[1:57:57] amen and now we're told for the days for
[1:58:00] the use of that car is over
[1:58:03] it's just a shiny something that sins
[1:58:05] that sits in a museum
[1:58:08] and and now it's um you know just a
[1:58:11] shiny something that we read about what
[1:58:13] God used to do and what this car once
[1:58:15] did it wanted to run this race Mayan
[1:58:18] South Africa that was great healings and
[1:58:21] miracles and and over there and and then
[1:58:23] the others so many come to Christ and it
[1:58:26] bound maniacs and you know we were
[1:58:28] eating all about it
[1:58:29] and we got a car in the museum
[1:58:37] because now that car's antique
[1:58:41] but these cars today
[1:58:43] we got a new model
[1:58:45] it's not filled with psychology
[1:58:48] because the car brother Brandon drove
[1:58:51] you know just didn't I don't know how
[1:58:52] the bells and whistles of the new one
[1:58:56] we modernized the new one until it's so
[1:58:59] dead
[1:59:00] so dead the horn won't even blow
[1:59:08] remember that there were there were two
[1:59:10] cars he were talking about
[1:59:13] both had worked
[1:59:15] high octane gasoline
[1:59:18] bill High okay let me tell you this
[1:59:22] Bible is how to
[1:59:26] amen it is it's got power in it
[1:59:31] don't you believe that
[1:59:32] but you can lay it on somebody that's
[1:59:34] dead it won't make them alive you can
[1:59:36] slay it on somebody that is sick it
[1:59:38] won't heal them but you ever let the
[1:59:40] spirit
[1:59:41] come down upon the word like Isaiah 53
[1:59:44] that says I was wounded for your
[1:59:47] transgressions I was bruised for your
[1:59:49] iniquity and the Holy Spirit come down
[1:59:52] upon that and ignite it to you you walk
[1:59:55] out of here Shield or saved or whatever
[1:59:57] the need is
[1:59:58] [Applause]
[2:00:00] now but you know
[2:00:03] we want the latest bells and whistles
[2:00:05] you know that those skin seats and the
[2:00:07] diamond studded steering wheels
[2:00:10] but it has no spark no life no Dynamics
[2:00:15] so let's guess what
[2:00:17] your gasoline might as well be water
[2:00:22] all the doctrine in the world might as
[2:00:24] well be water
[2:00:27] unless the holy spirit is there to
[2:00:28] Quicken it
[2:00:31] well
[2:00:33] you know
[2:00:35] the other car wasn't so polished but it
[2:00:38] would run
[2:00:41] two cars
[2:00:42] one Ghost Skin it's Diamond studded
[2:00:45] wouldn't go
[2:00:46] had to push it off the assembly line but
[2:00:48] it wouldn't move
[2:00:50] it's just for a display
[2:00:53] but you see but you see the island would
[2:00:56] dry
[2:00:57] you see it would run you said well
[2:00:59] brother Tim what you folks are driving
[2:01:01] his way too noisy we like it quiet

[2:03:39] of Jesus Christ and men and women are
[2:03:41] overcomer
[2:03:46] this is not a dead a motionless religion
[2:03:50] this truth this Doctrine comes as rain

[2:04:31] maturity out of your life
[2:04:33] the anointed word is not a dry and dead
[2:04:36] theology
[2:04:37] it's the last rain it's the outpouring
[2:04:41] of the holy spirit that brings the weed
[2:04:44] To The Head and the full maturity now
[2:04:47] things that are to be brother Branham
[2:04:48] told us he said that that we know that
[2:04:52] this is the day of salvation where God
[2:04:55] is calling men from the world from a
[2:04:57] life of sin unto life of service and in
[2:05:00] the day that God has poured out his
[2:05:02] Spirit from on high great signs and
[2:05:04] wonders are to accompany the ministry of
[2:05:06] this day this is when the farmer and
[2:05:10] latter rain are falling together and we
[2:05:13] know that there is supposed to be great
[2:05:15] signs and wonders which in many great
[2:05:17] denominations this is turned down
[2:05:19] now again it's the weed age that's where
[2:05:23] we're at let me just tell you what the
[2:05:25] grain is to be like the weed Age The
[2:05:28] Grain age it's the wheat age friends
[2:05:30] last a week There's a Ministry on the
[2:05:33] earth that's just like the one that went
[2:05:36] into the ground back Yonder the
[2:05:37] beginning a real Pentecostal experience
[2:05:43] oh yes we must lay in the presence of
[2:05:45] the sun it's the full light
[2:05:48] that's him Revelation 10 I already
[2:05:51] showed you his face was as it were the
[2:05:54] Sun
[2:05:55] brother Branham tells us in restoration
[2:05:57] the bride tree but the evening light
[2:06:00] shall rise in the west to shine upon the
[2:06:03] word to ripen the fruit to bring forth
[2:06:07] the bright tree with the same signs and
[2:06:09] wonders and fruits that they had at the
[2:06:12] beginning it shall be light in the
[2:06:14] evening time write all the words and
[2:06:17] will bring forth is fruit in its season
[2:06:19] it shall not wither it'll bring forth
[2:06:22] its fruit David said in its season amen
[2:06:24] same fruit it had at the beginning now
[2:06:28] with his word in his predestinated stage
[2:06:31] as he got it now we see the words all
[2:06:34] being manifested what is it's a perfect
[2:06:36] Vindication that the coming of the Lord
[2:06:39] is at hand he said I will restore
[2:06:42] so you see and and then he said you know
[2:06:46] I've been listening to the Pentecostal
[2:06:49] friends
[2:06:50] and he said my brethren there there
[2:06:52] predicted a sweeping Revival coming
[2:06:57] now listen they got one it was a
[2:07:00] charismatic Revival
[2:07:01] there's now not just a couple of million
[2:07:04] Pentecostals there's 500 there's a half
[2:07:08] a billion
[2:07:09] there's a half a billion Pentecostals
[2:07:12] now so you see they've had a sweep and
[2:07:15] revive
[2:07:16] but it was an intellectual Revival
[2:07:20] are you with me but he said he said now
[2:07:24] I think our our Revelation should must
[2:07:27] be scriptural and then we know it's
[2:07:28] right if it's scripture is from the Lord
[2:07:30] and I'm beginning to believe that that's
[2:07:33] right there's coming a ripening time for
[2:07:36] the evening fruits
[2:07:40] amen so well there ain't nothing more
[2:07:42] coming brother Tim he said I beginning
[2:07:45] to believe that what they said is
[2:07:48] actually right
[2:07:50] that there is to accommodate ripening
[2:07:53] time for evening fruits
[2:07:56] Hallelujah a maturity can't you see I
[2:08:00] mean maybe you're not tying it all
[2:08:01] together but Sarah had reached the point
[2:08:07] come on where that where that he was now
[2:08:11] the season and the time for the word to
[2:08:15] be made manifest and her faith had to be
[2:08:19] ripened
[2:08:20] [Applause]
[2:08:22] she had to start believing
[2:08:25] hey mama if I can't believe a Divine
[2:08:28] Healing how am I going to believe for a
[2:08:30] body change
[2:08:33] if I can't believe that God can save a
[2:08:36] soul from sin how can I believe he will
[2:08:39] heal a body from sickness
[2:08:44] now the last thing that the church is
[2:08:48] going to see brother Branham says and
[2:08:50] then message investment the last thing
[2:08:52] the church is going to see is Christ
[2:08:55] manifesting in his fullness in in his
[2:08:59] power in fullness in his church just
[2:09:02] before the fire falls
[2:09:05] is everybody with me on page
[2:09:07] amen the last thing so the last thing is
[2:09:11] God's coming in the flesh

[2:09:22] fulfilled

[2:10:12] alcoholics and got their own message and
[2:10:14] went out and deceived people and caused
[2:10:17] train wrecks everywhere

[2:13:07] this last day that we're living in for
[2:13:10] another surge of the Holy Spirit into
[2:13:12] the church for a Rapture and Faith just
[2:13:14] before it comes and everything is
[2:13:16] sitting straight in order for that and I
[2:13:19] believe that we know at the time that
[2:13:21] the word should have preeminence
[2:13:23] well what about some more brother Tim
[2:13:26] well he said in perfect Faith did you
[2:13:28] hear that perfect faith
[2:13:30] Sarah had imperfect faith

[2:13:36] just believed Hagar could do it and
[2:13:37] Abraham could do it and come on people
[2:13:40] said well brother Branham did and Christ
[2:13:41] didn't that but I don't know about me
[2:13:43] let me tell you

[2:13:59] it's got to be your voice
[2:14:01] I can't do it for you it's got to be
[2:14:04] your voice now you say to that mountain
[2:14:08] you need to start saying to that thing
[2:14:10] that's been bothering you you devil

[2:14:24] name of the Lord I will walk in Victory
[2:14:26] I will walk in love I will walk in
[2:14:29] within the grace of God I will be like
[2:14:31] Enoch and I walk with God that I am not
[2:14:39] he said I'm trying to hit the church
[2:14:42] into a place where we could really see
[2:14:44] Apostolic times
[2:14:46] moving Among Us
[2:14:48] that's what we all hunger
[2:14:51] it's just laying right the door but we
[2:14:53] want to see more of it we see it
[2:14:55] but we want to see more of it
[2:14:58] how many would say that we see it but we
[2:15:01] want to see more of it don't stop God
[2:15:04] don't stop the flow we wanted such a
[2:15:07] flow that'll be a help to us and it'll

[2:15:15] say brother dear my eye that you know
[2:15:18] all of that's passing that's just
[2:15:20] Pentecostalism it's not Pentecostalism
[2:15:23] hey Manny I'll tell you what it is the
[2:15:25] prophet of God said the reason I do
[2:15:28] believe that when the bride is called it
[2:15:30] and elected and said in the Book of Life
[2:15:33] there will come a sound from Heaven that
[2:15:36] it takes such a baptism of the Holy
[2:15:38] Spirit into that bride that I take her
[2:15:41] from the earth in Rapture Grace
[2:15:45] Hallelujah that's what we ought to be
[2:15:47] looking for amen that's what we ought to
[2:15:49] be expecting a sound from heaven and
[2:15:52] take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:15:54] into that bride
[2:15:57] Hallelujah Oh my he said he said in the
[2:16:01] world is the Fallen apart it seems like
[2:16:02] there's a drying out of the churches
[2:16:04] hardly can find the church anywhere
[2:16:07] that's alive but the word and with the
[2:16:09] spirit of God and great things taking
[2:16:11] place like it was not long ago
[2:16:14] don't sound like it's supposed to be in
[2:16:16] Decline
[2:16:17] sounds like we ought to be expecting
[2:16:19] that
[2:16:21] come on say well we got the doctrine
[2:16:24] it's rain then if it's true Doctrine
[2:16:26] it's rain it's the Holy Ghost it's being
[2:16:29] poured out on All Flesh and what does it
[2:16:32] do when it's poured out my sons and my
[2:16:35] daughters shall prophesy my young man
[2:16:38] will see Visions my old men will dream
[2:16:40] dreams in that day I'll pour out my
[2:16:43] spirit upon All Flesh somebody help me
[2:16:45] everybody you know that's the truth
[2:16:47] that's what God promised that's what
[2:16:50] God's doing
[2:16:51] amen you see the atmosphere has got to
[2:16:55] be right for it
[2:16:57] this is where Sarah was
[2:17:00] she was there in the wrong atmosphere
[2:17:05] said brother Tim atmosphere has nothing
[2:17:08] to do with that we don't want no
[2:17:09] atmosphere for the Holy Ghost well you
[2:17:12] just be that way I want it
[2:17:16] well we want a atmosphere for maturity
[2:17:19] well you know to be mature okay well
[2:17:22] that atmosphere then will bring gifts
[2:17:24] and signs and wonders and Holy Ghost and
[2:17:26] power of God and all of that
[2:17:30] but let me tell you as I bring this down
[2:17:33] to close
[2:17:36] that the atmosphere for this
[2:17:39] is right
[2:17:41] is right
[2:17:42] it's the right atmosphere
[2:17:45] you know what we try to do in our
[2:17:47] services is create an atmosphere
[2:17:51] because it's when the in the atmosphere
[2:17:53] things can happen
[2:17:55] when there's no atmosphere forward Faith
[2:17:58] isn't there
[2:18:00] amen healing isn't there Miracles ain't
[2:18:02] there it has to be an atmosphere for it
[2:18:06] are you with me so you know now
[2:18:09] I I don't even have time to get into
[2:18:11] this but maybe I'll do it in another
[2:18:13] service but if you took a glimpse down
[2:18:15] at Sodom
[2:18:16] just for a moment you would see Satan
[2:18:19] becoming incarnate in a people
[2:18:22] they're so full of the depth
[2:18:25] they will mock the righteous and abuse
[2:18:28] angels
[2:18:30] they hate righteousness they hate even
[2:18:34] the laws of God they don't even want his
[2:18:37] name mentioned
[2:18:41] this is the most anti-god nation that we
[2:18:45] have ever had to have given over to the
[2:18:46] devil they're over to reprobate Minds
[2:18:50] Sodom has increased in my generation
[2:18:53] from one percent of the population
[2:18:57] identifying this homosexual to nearly
[2:19:00] one out of four of those who are in
[2:19:03] Generation Z ages 18 to 25 now identify
[2:19:10] as homosexual to transgender
[2:19:14] one of them
[2:19:16] you know and the rest are okay with it
[2:19:21] I said the rest are okay with
[2:19:24] even those in my generation are okay
[2:19:27] with
[2:19:28] you you see it's your freedom to do so
[2:19:31] that was not American freedom
[2:19:34] American Freedom was not that
[2:19:37] you see that's democracy all sales and
[2:19:40] no anchor
[2:19:41] so they just keep on going you know
[2:19:43] where you're going to liberate
[2:19:45] everything and everything every devil in
[2:19:47] hell is coming out the closet
[2:19:49] to the point they want perverts and and
[2:19:52] everything else you you know
[2:19:54] um
[2:19:55] brother EJ tried to call me the other
[2:19:57] day and and and I learned about it from
[2:20:01] brother Timothy that one of our one of
[2:20:04] our school resource officers in
[2:20:06] Shreveport now he come and identified as
[2:20:09] a fox

[2:20:51] amen now brother Branham told us in the
[2:20:54] message of anointed one's end time he
[2:20:56] said there are three things that lay
[2:20:59] before you and see if this ain't
[2:21:00] prophecy first the world is in his
[2:21:03] solemn condition now across the world
[2:21:05] right now people are laughing at them
[2:21:06] stupid Americans well we are stupid go
[2:21:09] ahead and laugh but go around and look
[2:21:10] around
[2:21:12] the world is in a Sodom condition
[2:21:17] Jesus said it would happen look at the
[2:21:19] perversion are women trying to act like
[2:21:23] men are men trying to act like women
[2:21:26] sissified rotten filthy Lowdown devil
[2:21:31] possessed and don't know it and the
[2:21:34] Bible said it would happen and that's
[2:21:37] where it's at
[2:21:38] and you don't think I'll preach against
[2:21:40] it huh you missed it
[2:21:44] amen you missed it I will and you ought
[2:21:46] to be thankful for it
[2:21:50] amen
[2:21:51] we don't want our girls looking like men
[2:21:54] taking a hair looking like men we don't
[2:21:57] want our boys looking like women
[2:22:00] come on we want Holiness righteousness
[2:22:02] that's what the gospel produces
[2:22:06] amen so you see the world is in a silent
[2:22:11] condition Jesus said it would happen
[2:22:13] look at the perversion I'll tell you we
[2:22:16] ought to stay in our home it stops here
[2:22:19] it ain't welcome in a home it ain't
[2:22:21] welcome in our church
[2:22:23] [Applause]

[2:23:00] I want the prostitute to come but I
[2:23:03] don't want to remain prostitutes and gay
[2:23:05] and lesbian and this and that I want
[2:23:07] them to find Jesus I want them to find a
[2:23:10] change in their life that's what I
[2:23:12] wanted to find I want to see the power
[2:23:14] of God go forth and the salvation

[2:23:20] you say you don't love them yeah I love
[2:23:22] them I love them enough to say that sin
[2:23:25] that's wrong is an evil spirit but we
[2:23:28] got hope for you there is Mercy there is
[2:23:31] Grace
[2:23:38] we were just at a meeting
[2:23:41] that I preached
[2:23:42] I think it was when I preached
[2:23:45] there's a boy with a man bun I don't
[2:23:48] know I don't know how you get a man bun
[2:23:51] I had never seen a man bun
[2:23:54] they call him a man bun but that ain't a
[2:23:56] man bun
[2:23:57] man don't have buns
[2:24:01] that was a man with a woman bun
[2:24:07] you know you're confused
[2:24:10] no man bun there but anyway he came he'd
[2:24:14] been you know
[2:24:16] poor guy you know come up and had a soft
[2:24:18] voice and you know it wasn't wasn't you
[2:24:22] know it wasn't really a manly voice and
[2:24:24] people began to tell him he was he was
[2:24:27] really a girl
[2:24:28] he began to believe that lie
[2:24:30] took him out of the house and God took
[2:24:32] him out of church took him away from his
[2:24:34] family took him in the life of sin
[2:24:36] but you see he heard that there was a
[2:24:38] meeting going on
[2:24:39] and that there was hope for people like
[2:24:41] him
[2:24:43] and prophecy went forth that called him
[2:24:46] to an altar
[2:24:48] amen and before that he left from there
[2:24:51] that man
[2:24:52] with the girl bun gay men got to change
[2:24:56] in his life
[2:24:58] was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:25:00] and sent out a testimony I'm free I'm
[2:25:04] delivered I'm saved that the power of
[2:25:08] God under salvation
[2:25:10] that's the gospel that we preach that's
[2:25:13] the hope that we offer and when the Holy
[2:25:16] Ghost comes here to make a man a man and
[2:25:19] a woman a woman
