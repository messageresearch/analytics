author and the finisher of our faith we commit these things in the service in your hands in jesus name amen i want to look at hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8. and also revelations 1 and verse 10. hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen revelations 1 and verse 10 says i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha not i was or i may be or i will be i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what they'll see us write in the book and send it unto the seven churches verse 12 and i turn to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with the golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool and as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice has the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am not i was not i will be i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death amen we'll let you be seated i'd like to speak to you again on jesus christ the same omnipotence so we've been speaking about omnipotence omnipotence is all-powerful amen it's there's nothing greater than omnipotence amen so as we look here upon these things that we read here in revelations 10 amen jesus speaking to john would we give a direct revelation of himself and we can read in the verse 1 these are the things that hold this this is a thing saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and we know these seven golden candlesticks we've been taught are the seven church ages and we know that we're in the seventh church age and it's wonderful to know that he's in every age or he's in every day you know you're not you're not going one day there's not one day that he's not been there for you there's not one day that he hasn't been involved in our lives or every showing right here every day i am there in their midst and he said this is who he of whom it says the same jesus is both lord and christ there he is the only one the one and only lord god almighty and beside him there is no other there he is the savior walking in the midst of this church ages throughout the seven ages and the beautiful thing is what he was in the first age he is in all ages to every believer how many believers are here tonight so what he was in the first age of the first believers he is in the last days to the last believers he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what he did once he is still doing and he will keep on doing now we notice that jesus is walking alone in the midst of his church of the of the churches or in the midst of the golden candlesticks there is no one else with him there's no one beside him he is only the only one that is walking in the church or is the power of the church or the life of the church neither indeed can there be any other for he alone brought her salvation he alone purchased her salvation it was his own blood that he paid for her and he owns her his bride he is her lord and his he is her master and she will give him all the glory because he will not share glory with any other man he will not share glory with any other person he he alone deserves the glory and the honor and all the glory he won't give it to a pope he won't give it to an archbishop he won't even give it to his earthly mother mary amen because mary was not with him here he was alone he does not speak and turn to the father for he is the father he does not turn and give orders to the holy spirit for he is the spirit of god the eternal god the eternal spirit the life that is flowing and paul satan in the church of the living god it is his life that has given her life and without him she is nothing without him she has no life salvation is of the lord amen there was no one with him when he tried the fierceness of the wrath of the fiery furnace it was him and him alone it was him who hung on the cross and paid the price for our healing and our salvation it was him and him alone that gave his blood amen he is the author he is the finisher of our faith he is the alpha and the omega of our salvation and we are espoused to him and no one other hallelujah we don't belong to a church we belong to him we don't belong to a creed we belong to him we don't belong to a dogma we belong to him it is jesus alone who is walking in the midst of his church it is god in her it is god working in her it is god living in her it is god overcoming in her it is him and him alone we have only relation one only one relationship to god and god has only one relationship to you and that is jesus christ and jesus alone now we see in here also as we've read he had seven stars in his right hand the right hand of a signifies a power or authority in other words amen don't don't get it wrong the stars are not what has the power the hand has the power amen it's not the stars that has the authority it is the hand that has the authority that hold the stars amen so and we can see here in the right hand of the power or of that hand or the seven stars and we know these seven stars represent seven church messengers and this signifies the very power and authority of god are behind every messenger to every age they go forth in the power and the fire of the holy ghost they are stars why because they reflect the light they are not the light but they reflect the light they don't have no light of their own oh hallelujah amen they they don't have a message of their own this is not william branham's message it wasn't luther's message it wasn't wesley's message it wasn't even paul's message he had met god for himself and god the hand that holds him the authority and the power amen the omnipotence behind him it's his message hallelujah these seven messengers are making god known to the people and he that receiveth him receives him that sent him amen in matthew 18 or matthew 28 and verse 18 jesus came and he spake this he said all power is given unto me all power and they can say all power all power is given unto me amen and unto me in heaven and in earth amen and and he says go ye therefore and teach all nations baptize them in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever command you then lo i am with you always hallelujah i am with you always so it doesn't matter if a friend's with you he's with you don't matter if mom and dad is with you he's with you doesn't matter if a church is with you he's with you doesn't matter if the prophet is with you he's with you because it's him and his life that's permeating down through the church ages and he said i will never leave you do you realize omnipotence said that omnipotence said i will never leave you yeah though you walk through the valley of the shadow of them i'll fear no evil why because thou art with me hallelujah so there you are he says men full of the holy ghost and faith on fire with the fire of god holding forth the word of truth and there he stands to back them up what stands there omnipotence stands there all power stands there and think of it and now listen to the prophet of god he don't just leave that in a prophet he said and think of it not one believer of any age this is right following what he says about the messengers and he goes right into it he says then think of it not one believer of any age need cry in his heart oh that i might have lived back there in that age or i might be there somewhere else there's no need for that look up behold him who's even now walking in your midst even now in the churches behold him who is even now the same yesterday today and forever behold him who never changes either in essence or ways and where two or three are gathering his name there he is in their midst in other words omnipotence is here tonight omnipotence is here to back you up when you stand upon the promise of god and say this is my promise this is my word god has revealed it to my heart omnipotence is there to back that promise up hallelujah because listen to this he said not only is he in your midst as a complacent onlooker amen now you may come to a church as a complacent onlooker but he don't ever come to church as a complacent onlooker amen you might come to church to sit on the sidelines and maybe watch somebody shout and watch somebody get a victory but that ain't that ain't his attitude when he comes to church he said he don't because this is what he said where two or three are gathered in his name he don't come to church as a complacent onlooker or is that recording angel he comes to church to express what he is he comes to church to bring life he comes into the midst of his people to be the sustainer and the giver of all good gifts he comes to church to bring healing he comes to church to bring joy he bronzer he comes to church to bring deliverance he comes to church to set you free he don't come to sit on the sidelines he comes to get in the midst of you [Applause] and work on your behalf who walketh it's a who walketh it's a it's a word of action he's not who sitteth on a seat somewhere in the corner who walketh in the midst it's a word of action he's an action tonight oh my oh hallelujah and it could be on your need he's moving on your heart he's moving he's touching you tonight he's in action tonight he walketh he said how meaningful are these words when viewed in the light of the scripture which describes him as christ who is our life he's the life of the church she has no other life without him she's simply a religious society a club a meaningless gathering of people as a corpse bejeweled and dressed it's still a corpse so is the church and no matter how our programs how great they are how wonderful our efforts are without christ she is a corpse amen without him in her midst without him motivating her without him being the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all in this very hour he's walking in her midst do you realize who's among us tonight did we two or three how many or two how many two or threes we got here tonight then he promised he would be here who's here tonight omnipotence is here tonight what tell me what can cancer do in the face of omnipotence what can any sickness do in the face of omnipotence that's the face that's here tonight omnipotence is in the building he declared he would be here he said he would be here i'm not here to say it because it's my word it's his word he said where two or three are gathered in his name i will be in their midst well he didn't come here to sit on the sidelines he come to grab a hold of that devil that's been tormenting you and say leave him he's been coming to grab that sickness and say sickness you went far enough hallelujah and what he was as he walked in the first age he's even now in the last stage oh my jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so without christ you're just a corpse without him you're nothing amen without christ remember but he is here to take on human battles oh hallelujah he's here tonight to show you he's the shame yesterday today and forever he's here to defend you amen when you can't defend yourself he's here to defend you amen omnipotence has the final say over you listen that that that situation you're in it has a voice but it ain't the final voice amen the sickness that you have it has a voice but it ain't the final voice that doctor's report you got it has a fire it has a voice but it is not the final voice amen only he can be the final voice omnipotence has the final voice because you can't get more greater than omnipotence therefore he is our defender let's read about our defender the bible would say the lord is my strong defender oh my he is the one who has saved me he is my god and i will praise him oh another one deliver me from my enemies oh god defend me from those who rise up against me how about how many has been having some rise up against you this morning this week amen there is a defender in the building tonight there's somebody that's willing to take on your case [Applause] that says you've been falsely accused amen there's a devil that's been lying on you but there's a judge that's become our attorney and he said i got your case oh hallelujah declare me innocent oh god defend me against these ungodly people rescue me from these unjust liars my god is my protection and with him i am safe he protects me like a shield he defends me and keeps me safe he's my savior he protects me and saves me from violence whoa jesus may the lord answer you in the day of trouble may the name of the god of jacob set you up on high and defend you amen don't rob the poor just because you can don't exploit the needy in court for the lord is their defender and he will ruin anyone who runs them oh jesus hallelujah no wonder he'd look at you and say blessed are the meek blessed are the low amen because i got your back i'll take on your battles you're not walking along in this you're not by yourself and then but i'm your defender i'm your god i'm on your side i'm here putting myself in the middle of your situation you may feel like you're walking down the fire furnace by yourself but don't worry when you get there i'll be there [Applause] and you'll come out of that situation without even the smell of smoke on you hallelujah the lord is your mighty defender perfect and just in his own ways oh your god is faithful and true he does what's right and fair for he will give his angels special charge over you to accompany you and defend you and to preserve you my god i'm about ready to take off running around this place i hope somebody's here to not ready to join me because when i see god has took my case and has put special officers up over me to where the devil can't get to me no matter how hard he tried he can only go so far he can only say so much but his voice only has so much power it has limitations but my god that's spoken over my life he has no power no limits to his power he has no limits to his ability [Applause] brandon would take it in the token he would say the judge has become your attorney he said therefore the case is closed the case is dismissed oh hallelujah i remember when my case got dismissed when the devil brought all kind of accusations up against me but god paid every debt he paid debts i could not owe and he wiped them all away and he wrote on my case case dismissed there is omnipotence in the building tonight that i can pull up your case in a moment and write with his blood dismissed because he said i'm going to ruin what runs you oh my it's what he was saying psalms 3 and verse 1 how o lord how many are they that increased this troubles me many are they that rise up against me many there be the say of my soul there's no help from him in god but thou o lord are a defender a shield a final voice my glory and lifter of my head i cried unto the lord with my voice and he hired me [Applause] oh hallelujah don't don't fail to realize your cries have been heard [Applause] it may not seem like it's nothing going on it may not seem like nothing is happening but god heard your first prayer god heard the first voice as you would lift it up into heaven say father i need you and it seems like nothing has happened but the answer is on the way i laid down and slept and i awakened for the lord sustained me i'll not be afraid of ten thousand of people or ten thousands of demons that have set themselves against me round about because i know no matter how much the devil can get my god's got more [Music] oh yes arise o lord save me o my god for thou smitten all mine enemies upon my cheekbone thou has broken the teeth of the ungodly salvation belongeth unto the lord thy blessing is upon thy people let's look at revelations 3 and verse 14. this is our it's what he is at the end he is or at the beginning he is at the end now let's go to the end these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness oh hallelujah these things saying sayeth amen so it tells you the amen has a voice the amen has something to say and what the amen says is amen it ain't so be it and it's not it's not even how we use amen if you look at amen you know as you've been responding to the word even tonight you say amen that's so be it yes lord it's more of a unction of a word of of saying of agreement but this word here is actually a finality it's actually almost like a period that when he says amen it's finished it's not that he has to agree to even you and it's not he's saying amen to you and he's agreeing but what he's saying is it's done amen so the amen has a voice jesus has given us this description in this last days of himself as grace's days of grace are winding up he's looking from the first century right through the 20th all the way down to the ending of the age and he begins to reveal of his characteristics and he gives us one look of his supreme deity his omnipotence his ability to put a period and no man can erase it no devil can wipe it off when he says it's finished it's finished when he says it's done it's over with but it's not over with until god says it's over with oh my god thus saith that amen jesus is the amen of god jesus is let so let it be of god a man stands for finality it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promises it stands for unchanging promises it stands for the seal of god the holy ghost is the amen on your life there a man of god on your life the seal of god that stamps here and when that stamp comes on the devil is finished he might once could walk through your life and destroy and make you do all kind of ungodly things but when that seal that a man has placed upon your life that final say he's lost his power over you i'm looking at a bunch of people tonight the devil has lost his power over you he's lost his say over you he's lost his ability to mess up make you go a certain way or to do a certain thing but there's an amen on your life the amen approves of you when that amen approves of you you're not you don't seek of other people's approval because god chose you and if god chose you that's all that matters it doesn't matter if sweet pea likes you or this person likes you or that person hates you it could care less god chose me [Music] when somebody realizes god's choice on their life and god's choosing on my life that what makes them willing to forsake mama and daddy and brothers and sisters and leave their whole life and leave everything and move to a different place why because they realize god chose me that's right sister cathy ain't it you left everything you knew why because you realize i'm not a hutterite that was the devil's voice on my life that was man-made creeds over my life that was man-made dogmas and doctrines over my life but one day i heard another voice i heard a final voice and it started something from such a cathy's heart to where she left mama she left daddy she left everything that she ever knew why because she now had god's approval listen when you realize you got god's approval that's why people that got god's approval and they realized god's approval therefore they're not worried about anybody else's approval therefore they're not worried about being in the latest fads and the latest this and the latest that because they're not seeking man's approval they got god's approval and that's all that matters when you see somebody that's going after every fad of the world dress uh paint this that and the other they're seeking an approval they're thirsty but they're looking in the wrong glass but there is a there is a place here you can drink just like the woman at the whale drunkard she was one time looking for somebody else's approval she tried one man lost it one another man lost it another man lost it and she went to one man after another until she came to the seventh man and he said i got a drink that if you'll drink it you won't ever thirst again it'll take it all away from you and you'll realize you don't have to seek after that approval no more i chose you i called you you were mine it's going down brother brannon would bring out the scripture in isaiah 65 and verse 16 said that he who blesses himself in the earth shall be blessed shall bless himself in the god of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth and brother brown would take it and he'd bring it down he said it's it's the god of the amen it's the truth is the final say or the final voice the amen amen the amen says i create new heavens and new earth the amen says the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind oh amen says be glad and rejoice forever in that which i created and behold i create jerusalem a joy rejoice say honor people with joy and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying he said that's the new jerusalem this is a millennium we're about to go into that but he talks about they say the god of truth is the god of the amen the god of the amen here's jesus of the new testament the god of the amen and there's jehovah the old testament the god of the amen the god of truth the final saying omnipotence of the old is now omnipotence in the new year hallelujah oh israel the lord thy god is one god the new testament does not reveal another god it's a further revelation of the one and same god christ did not come down to make himself known he did not come to reveal the son he came to reveal and make known the father he never talked about two gods he talked about one god and now in this last age we come back to the capstone revelation the most important revelation of the godhead in the whole bible that is jesus is god he and the father are one there is one god and his name is the lord jesus christ and he is the god of the amen and he never changes and he never will change oh what he says he'll stand upon it what he does he's done it forever and he'll do it through eternity none can take from what he says or add to it so let it be a man aren't you glad you served that kind of god it's like i've said before i'm i'm thankful to serve a god don't have a mind of a fickle man then one day i love me and the next day hate me you don't know if you got up on the day he loves you or you got up on the day he hated you if he loved you at the beginning he'll always love you if he called you at the beginning you'll always be his he is the amen and he won't change it means whatever he said is final it means whatever he said in the first age the second age the third age to all ages about his true church and about the false vine is exactly true and it won't change so what did he say about that he said if that first spine would ever ever put out another branch it'll write another book of acts behind it amen i believe he meant that it means that what he started out with in genesis he will finish in revelations he has to for he is the amen now we can see again why the devil hates these two books he hates the truth he knows the truth will prevail he knows what he's in will be he knows how how he how he fights that but thank god he says we are on the winning side we are on the amen side oh hallelujah oh he's faithful he don't change his word because of circumstances he don't change his word because of how great a sickness is or how terrible it is he don't change his word because of how bad sin is or how how bad unbelief he is his word remains the same amen to be to be omnipotent he has to remain that way he cannot change he said some he said sometimes we get the idea of god though he made a way of salvation wade being on the cross and his death of christ that talking for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him that somehow this god just folded his arms and began to stand back and watch if it is as he said we've taught of him being a great creator who having created now lost his personal interest in his creation he's i'll say that as how too many people are apt to think but that is the wrong thinking god is governing in the affairs of men right now he is both creator and sustainer this is what he would call him in colossians 1 16 for by him were all things you say all things all things created that are in heaven that on earth visible and invisible whether they be in thrones dominion principalities powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist only omnipotence could all things conspire omnipotence could all things consist but are all things be created but he's a sovereign god and by his own counsel he purposed the plan of his salvation for his own elect the son died upon the cross to establish his salvation and the holy spirit came to execute the will of the father he's working all things at this moment according to his holy purpose according to his will right now he's in the midst of it all every situation every problem every sickness every sick thing you're going through he's in the middle of it not with his arms folded and looking on the sideline but he's involved in your life i'm trying to get to your omnipotence is involved in your life he's involved in the trial that you're in he's involved in the thing that's going on through your mind and your mind battles he knows all about it he said the savior god is working amongst him his own right now as the great shepherd of the sheep the great creator savior god is faithfully working his very existence is for you his very existence is for you omnipotence existence is for you and his eyes are ever on you do you realize you don't get up one day the sun don't crack dawn one morning that his eyes ain't on you the sun don't go down one night that his eyes ain't on you there's not a minute there's not a nanosecond there's not the smallest uh uh of value of time that is i is not watching you omnipotence all powerful the great one the almighty god omnipotence involved in every detail of your life your lives are hidden with christ and god oh i'm so glad that my god abides faithfully he's true to himself he won't lie it's true to the word he'll back it up he's true to us he won't leave not one of us but we'll raise us up at the last day i'm glad that i'm resting in that faithfulness philippians 1 6 would say it like this being confident in this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ hallelujah he's a true witness amen he's a true god oh hallelujah let me go on down brother brannon would bring some of these thoughts out in the absolute talk about the omnipotence of god and absolute being the last word or the amen or the final word or he said absolute means and i went and looked it up in the dictionary there it means the last thing it's unlimited there's nothing else in its way it's supreme it's ultimate amen he says he said it's the amen so we serve a god who's never wrong [Music] we serve a god who don't make wrong choices oh praise the lord that means when he chose you he didn't make the wrong choice that means when he chose you he saw something on the inside of you and said that's my son that's my daughter we serve a god who don't make mistakes i want you to understand you are not a mistake that's the devil's voice over here that's trying to tell you you're a mistake or you was an accident or you were just a happenstance that you're even here your parents didn't even plan for you to be here you're an accident that is a lie the devil god saw you he saw you before there ever was a devil before the devil ever had a voice god saw you and he said that was mine that was mine that was mine that was mine that was mine and i don't make a mistake i don't go back and say i made the wrong choice i chose him he's still mine [Applause] satan raised up in his life and tried to destroy him but he's still mine drugs came but he's still mine how all kind of sin was poured out in his life but it's still my well why because you was always his you was always his you need to tell that devil tonight i'm here tonight because i always was his not a mistake i'm not happens chance that i'm here i'm here because god saw me and he put me here for a purpose omnipotence chose you and he's never wrong he showed it in this day in this hour i think that's why it's so wonderful the pastors brought it out several times about the amen how the prophet of god would begin to speak the word of god and lay things out in the word there's a lot of people that didn't agree with him lost many friends people today are walking away from it finding faults and this and that finding their little negative spins and things that they can kind of spin some way but god came behind it and he said amen he said he's a faithful and true witness he don't witness something that's false hey man that's why you never will receive him while you're living a false life he only witnessed a true life he only witnessed a true repentance he'll only witness a true dying out amen but he came behind it you know brother brown would i just listen to him to him this week because he would say you know i you know he said you think people i know people are saying i'm just stalling or i'm just saying a few words he said but you know why i'm what i'm doing he said i'm waiting on him he said i don't even know if he'll come do this or not he said but he's been faithful for me [Laughter] and god would come behind it and say amen and vindicate a message that was spoke vindicated time after time after time even even the people his peers and those around him had to witness and say this was nothing but bible days are here again god is once again unveiling himself among us you know i believe his brother wayne brought this out a few years ago and it's in the absolutes wonderful wonderful sermon in phoenix arizona brother brown tells about that young lady that had had gotten a lot of peer pressure and of the way she lived and the way she dressed and things and and began to be ridiculed and made fun of and to where she lost her mind went through a nervous break break uh uh break down and lost her mind and he's called in there to to uh to to pray for and he goes in there and he's sitting there with this little girl and and he's sitting there on the seat with her and he's talking with her and trying to speak to her and she's just sitting there looking looking out the window or something just looking staring off said you see and her mother says you see billy what can we do he said now you listen norma christ is still christ take that into every battle christ is still christ she said this is our last chance if they take her up there you know what's going to happen said they're going to try to move her to another home or something i guess we'll never see her again the treatment that we don't know what she'll go through i said she said just normal don't get excited wait a few minutes and see what god would do he's still god no more than i said that there stood a girl before me in a vision just as normal well as she could be smiling she was looking towards a young man and i looked at the young man and looked back the vision left me i said norma does she have a boyfriend kind of tall and dark-headed she said yes sir she does he said does she do something with him and sing and said yes that's right he said don't you worry i have thus saith the lord she's coming out of it she's coming out of it and norma threw her hands and caught me by the knee looked up for her husband said honey it's never wrong it's never wrong what the prophet no the word of god the vision is never wrong the word is never wrong i'm here to say it again it's an absolute it's never wrong it said i'm the lord god that heals all thy diseases it's never wrong hallelujah he said i'm the joy the joy-giver the springing up of joy it's never wrong that girl never changed a bit said all right norma you know what i wouldn't have told you that unless i'd seen it and god can't lie i went out of my hospital the hospital got my own car and they stayed about two hours from then the phone started ringing i come up from mr woods down below and it was his father her father he was on the phone he said brother brandon i got to tell you something you hadn't been gone 20 minutes until she came to herself just as normal as she could be she's been examined by the whole staff of doctors we're taking her home in the morning hallelujah good morning shalom amen the doctor's report had a voice but it wasn't the final voice but when the absolute comes in the room the final voice falls into the room then every devil has to be silenced i don't care how hard it is or how impossible it seems when i've neutered the speaks it shuts up every devil it's a line it's a lot of the tribe of judah when a lion roars in the jungle everything else begins to shut up why because the most powerful beast is roar it has spoken and let me hear tell you tonight oblivious is in the building and omnipotence is speaking omnipresent is saying you're not going to stay where you're at you're not going to go down in that thing but i've come to give you life and life more abundantly and when it speaks all hell shuts up so what happened that lady looked at that vision as an absolute and if you can ever look to this as an absolute heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail oh what a place he said it's just like a ship a ship has an absolute it's called an anchor that anchor goes down in the bottom of a sea and that water gets a rolling and get to rocking and the wave starts crashing it can only take that ship so far even waves have limitations it can only do so much it can only go far so far why because a ship has an absolute it has an anchor down there you can't see it you can't feel it maybe you can't you can't touch it but it's there how you know it's there because every time i've gotten the sin or something starts pulling me one way there's an anchor grabs there the devil starts blowing me over here there's an anchor grabs there amen we have an anchor it's not made of steel it's not made of some kind of man-made dogma man-made creed we have an anchor and that's the lord jesus christ and it's all the way tied down all the way down to the rock of ages and it's grabbing hold of that rock tonight and hell may be blowing against you and sin may be coming against you and the devil says i got you and the devil says you're going to die and the devil says that he's only got so much voice left [Applause] he's only got so many words left he's about to his last word he's about to come on somebody ah my mama he's about to his last voice he's about to his last moment hallelujah his authority's already been cast down it's already been broke i read about it jesus has the keys he don't even have the keys to his own house i don't know what he's bragging about over you tonight but tell them devil you ain't got no power you're a bluff you come here with that you might as well get out of here with that i ain't taking what you got i'm not taking your nonsense no longer i have an anchor [Applause] it's a final voice it's an anchor amen oh hallelujah let me get on down god has the final say over your life i'm going to say that one more time because i want it to hit hard tonight god has the final say over your life you know we face all kinds of situations that look permanent like that we're never going to get out of and it's never going to work out it's easy to get discouraged it's easy to accept that it just wasn't meant to be but let me tell you it's not over until god says it's over amen the medical report may not look good and that's but that sickness don't have the last words god has a final say people may be against you you may have opposition but people don't have the final say come on now i mean no disrespect to the doctors or the bankers or the lawyers or the experts or the judges they may be good people but they're not on the throne god is on the throne and him being for you is more than the world that's against you [Applause] hallelujah amen sister rachel don't forget him that's for you it's more than those that are against you hallelujah they don't have the final say but my god has the final say and god won't let you get into a problem that it can't get you out of oh this is shouting material here tonight there's not a problem god will let you get in that it can't get you out [Applause] he wouldn't let the three hebrew children go down to a furnace if he couldn't get him out of there if he was didn't know the fire wasn't going to harm them king nebuchadnezzar he thought he was in control he thought he had the final say he thought that fire would finish them off and that's about all that's what always happens the devil thinks he's got the final say he thinks he's going to finish you off he thinks but that's at this time he wasn't just dealing with ordinary people did you hear me man i'm going to need to win them brother aaron uh brother andrew glover thanks check check mike check check one two three this time king nebuchadnezzar was not dealing with ordinary people he was dealing with the children of the most high god [Applause] and it's time the devil knows you're not dealing with just ordinary people but you're dealing with blood bugs you're dealing with children that's been paid for with the price of god's blood and those children came out without even a smell of smoke on them there's something about you that makes you unstoppable you have an advantage you said me i don't feel like you have an advantage god on god not only breathe life into you but he's put a protection a defense around you nothing can touch you without his permission you're not at the mercy of a bad break or you're not at the mercy of sickness or an accident or you're not at the mercy of people that's against you none of that can stop your destiny none of that can stop who you are you're not going through life by yourself god is behind the scenes he's orchestrating it to your favor first peter 3 says jesus has the last word on everything and every one you may be dealing with sickness medical reports may be saying you're not going to make it that's one word but god has the last word a diagnosis is not a verdict let me tell that devil that one more time a diagnosis is not a verdict it's not a final word but the verdict is i'm the lord god that heals all diseases i am the restorer i am the giver of the life sickness you might have a say devil you might have a say but i have some good news what you say is subject to my god what you say is overruled by my god he has the final say over my life and everything that i go through instead of considering the circumstances you need to look at how big your god is and the bigger you make your god the smaller your circumstances become and the more faith begins to rise in your heart listen experts can be wrong somebody said it like this they said experts built a titanic amateurs built an ark put that in your pipe they can make the most educated guess and say what they know but still be wrong what they fail to add into the equation is a see gene of god on the inside of you omnipotence on the inside of you on your own what they're saying may be true but you're not on your own on your own what they're saying you only got so many months to live might be true but you're not on your own the lord is on your side brother aaron i heard that story i heard he preached that i'm gonna go ahead and say it now because i didn't know he preached it here while i was gone one time i didn't remember it we talked about colonel travis down there at the alamo remember hear that sermon alive and remain is that what you titled it something like that maybe sometimes you don't even give a title i need to write brother joe shall remain that's about it colonel travis i don't have it here in front of him but he gets the ultimatum to surrender mexican army had surrounded him on all sides he was outnumbered by a lot he put it that way a lot and he writes a letter to the to the texans and the american people and he writes out the details of the surrender and he said i responded with a cannon shot i like that kind of response he didn't respond well i guess you know they're right what we're going to he knew to surrender his death anyway and to surrender to that thing the devil's tormenting you with is death [Applause] there is no peaceful surrender with the devil it's time some of you start loading that cannon and say devil i got a response for you tonight you've been throwing your threats at me and you've been saying i ain't gonna make it you've been saying this message ain't from you if you've been saying this message ain't for me you've been saying i'm gonna give up you've been saying i'm gonna die in a few months you've been putting all kind of fear let me respond to you tonight boom it's time to respond to that devil there's more with us than it's against us hallelujah colonel travis wrote it all out and at the bottom of his ladder he said p.s p.s the lord is on our side let me remind that devil tonight there's more force the king of kings the captain of the lord's host the same one that blew down that wall the same one that opened the eyes of the blind the same one that gathered his phrase together and said lazarus come forth he's on my side he's on my side he opened the eyes of the blind he healed him before he'll do it again he's on my side [Applause] and a god before us who can be against us omnipotence the most powerful force in the universe is moving right now on your behalf he has the final say he has a final say over your health he has a final say over your children he has a final say over your situation many there be the rise up against me but thou o lord are a shield for me oh my mama when abraham was 100 years old and sarah was haiti this was 20 years past the promise they came into the final word sarah gave birth to a son what happened god overrode overrode all rules of nature he overrode what the experts had to say he overrode the mistakes they had made oh praise god amen so don't let if abraham were here today would tell you don't let circumstance talk you out of what god put in you it may look dead it may seem impossible the experts say no way but i can tell you firsthand god has the final say can i say it like this i'm going to take a little bit of a turn here for a moment don't lose you but don't turn the game off too soon maybe you've been in this predicament one time and it was two teams just to say football and they're playing a football game and you're pulling for one team as you normally would and you're pulling against your arch rival or whatever it is and there's a and you're pulling for them and and all of a sudden that arch rival you know your team you come down to your last drive and you're making that last if you can score you're going to win and something happens it's interception you you you turn off the radio that's right i lost some of you right there with radio with tv's brother and you get mad the other team's dumping gatorade on the coach and they're screaming they're shouting they don't want the victory but there's a final say and a referee he's the ultimate he's a he he has the final say of the of the game and he saw a thing that happened that it caused the reversal and and it went back and you didn't turn it off and you didn't walk away from it you're mad you're angry and meanwhile your team plays and they win and you realize a few minutes later hours later what they won and i missed it why because you turned the game off too soon and i'm here to tell you don't turn the game off too soon tonight it may seem like all the odds are against you it may seem like you'll never come out it may seem like you'll never be healed and it may seem like amen the other people have won the victory and they're doing the dancing and they're boring the gatorade and they're going on but there's a final say let me remind hell you celebrated too early 2000 years ago hallelujah 2000 years ago you was down in hell and you was jumping the gatorade and you were shouting and you were saying we got him we knew through the cross it's over with we got it it's over with we got it who is that who is that it happens to be the final saying it happens to be the final word well hallelujah you may see your enemies tonight and they're dancing to the shout and they're pouring the gatorade but tonight may you hear the knock who's that it's the chief of the captain of the lord's host he's in the building hey the devil made a foul play right there he didn't do it right go back and do it over again erase the tape erase it it's not right he's done wrong against you but i'm here with the final say i'm here with the wrong the right words to speak to your situation [Music] hallelujah and that final word walked into hell and he opened the doors of hell and he grabbed the keys off of him while they had the pom-poms while their satan was all dressed in gatorade [Music] oh he was having a good time in hell until that devil might have been having a good time in your life but all of a sudden and when he come to your life he didn't come to get it the keys he come to remind the devil i got the keys you don't have no power over this one you're holding with a broken cell you're rolling with a broken chain you're over with broken rules it's not your regulations it's not your role i am has come down hallelujah i am he that was scared but is alive forevermore and i have the keys to your sickness and your problems and your situation i have the keys you realize there's one in the building here tonight that has the keys he has the keys your situation your family power to your joy he has a key to it the devil don't have the key god has secured has a final say and the final say is this all right victory you shall overcome you shall you will be made whole you will beat me we shall receive the children in this church whose report do you believe i shall believe the report of the lord come on musicians hallelujah do you realize what happens hell will celebrate hell was making fun

was all in there ah not no more i'm the one dumping the gatorade i'm the one swinging the pom-pom i'm the one saying here he is the king of kings the lord of lords the healer of the broken pieces the god of god my god my change my all in all it's time to have a celebrate because the roles have been reversed you remember hell was celebrating over some of your lives brother philip how long did hell celebrate i got him i got it all of a sudden a voice spoke what you've seen in the natural you also see in the supernatural do you realize that was the same voice of omnipotence that said lazarus come forth let that one sink in because that's exactly what happened we saw lazarus come forth you know i was reading today about lazarus it was a man some scholars have agreed that the sadducees they believe that the spirit of a man stayed in him three days and of course there was arch for enemies of jesus so what jesus do he wait till the doctrine's been broke [Music] remember martha mary's going through this test and jesus is waiting for the devil to realize you ain't got no power you're not gonna better come up with an excuse for this one oh his spirit was still there no he was gone sunk in stink all over his body but omnipotence stepped to the wall said lazarus come forth if he wouldn't have said lazarus there'd been a general resurrection but he called him he's here to call some seeds
