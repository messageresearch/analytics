speak through my lips father Lord may it be delivered Lord in the way which it was given just help me to get out of the way Lord that your will be done tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles with you we're going to read from Genesis 12 and 1. Genesis 12 and 1. we'll read through verse 3. then we'll let you have your seat before we read in several other places it says now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the Earth be blessed amen you have your seats tonight we'll just pray the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word and we're also going to read from Genesis 15 and 3 and then also abortion in Genesis 17. Genesis 15 3 says in Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and and lo one born in my house is mine Heir and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowel shall be thine air and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of the Earth the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it skipping down to verse 18. it says in the in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates and also I'm going to read in Genesis 17 and verse 1. Genesis 17 and 1. it says that when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger in all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God Amen amen this thought tonight I hope I can convey it properly as we go through it it's not meant to to be attacking or even cutting but to serve as a warning or an admonition not to be satisfied with being a message believer not to be satisfied and not to ever rest on our on our works not to take um our calling for granted and not not to rest even in that we are a chosen people not to rest in that but to always be seeking more and looking for more always seeking more Revelation always seeking another outpouring because one thing to me that is a sure sign that you have been called and chosen and had an experience with God is that you're looking for more and you're seeking for more amen so tonight I'd like to speak to us for a little while on the expectations of Pharisees the expectations of Pharisees and and the call of God to Abraham right here and and God's covenant starting right here in chapter 12 seems to be a great um a mark it marks a great turning in the scriptures because back in Chapter 3 of Genesis we see the fall and and and and from verse from chapter 3 all the way to chapter 11 humanity is depicted in an almost continual spiral towards sin so from chapter 3 to verse 11 it's this downward spiral but here in chapter 12 we have an introduction of God's plan for a path to Redemption amen and I'm so glad that that path is established and the the Covenant with Abraham is established and and in these interactions these three different interactions that we looked at we we see details of the Covenant began to emerge Abraham is going to be blessed a great nation will come out of the Kings will come out of Thee I will give thee a land I will be a god unto thee and thy seat after thee and I will save thee and thy seed after thee and brother Branham says here God called Abraham out of what that whole world of people why because Abraham was better no sir it's Grace God's chosen election and call you are what you are because the grace of God has made you what you are who taking thought can add one cubit to his stature is that right it's by Grace amen I'm thankful for that tonight that it's Grace it's amazing grace it's nothing that I can do nothing that you can do but God called God chose God elected and tonight I say thank you Lord Jesus for that Amazing Grace amen amen when my nature was against God he called me when I was alienated from God without hope he called me it was nothing I did but he said that one is mine and tonight I'm thankful for that call amen Abraham we see was no better than anyone and God called him and made his Covenant with him unconditional what Grace what Grace to make it unconditional because God took him upon himself that I'm going to make this Covenant and I'm going to keep this Covenant because we found out early on you cannot rely on man time after time man would break the Covenant man would fall away from the Covenant man would forget the Covenant but God said I'm going to do this I'm going to make thee a great nation I'm going to bless you it was all about what he was going to do he didn't put it on me and he didn't put it on you so tonight we can have faith that this is God's word it's God's covenant he's going to bring it to pass in our lives tonight amen he was determined I will save man because man couldn't do it man couldn't keep it man would forget it but God wouldn't amen that's why tonight that we can have faith because it's not our covenant it's not brother Tim's Covenant it wasn't even brother branham's Covenant it's God's covenant this is God's word amen he said I will make of thee a great nation I will establish my Covenant between me and thee he said unto thy seed have I given this lamb he said a father of many nations have I made thee he said I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee well how am I going to do this Lord I don't even have a son how is this going to be possible how am I going to accomplish all that you're not Abraham I am I am oh how am I going to overcome and let us see how am I going to do this he said I'll have a church without spotter wrinkle how are we going to do it how are we not going to do it we're not going to do it it's his Covenant he said I am I'm going to bring it to pass I will have a church I will have a bride I will give you Victory I will give you the Holy Ghost I will bring a body change it's him doing the work tonight you're not going to have to do this I am amen man couldn't do it never could do it always would break the Covenant so he called and he chose and he elected and he said these are my people and I will bless them and I will keep them many times throughout history we work in the Old Testament we see that they would fall but they were still his people oh that gives me Faith tonight that gives me encouragement tonight they would fall but they were still his people sometimes they were slaves but they were still chosen sometimes they were in a Wilderness but they were still his they were still called and they were elected sometimes you're in a Wilderness sometimes you're in a battle sometimes you don't know which way is up but you're still called You're Still chosen you're still elected you're still his your trial isn't changing that tonight whatever you're going through and changing that tonight you are the called The Chosen you are the Covenant people of Jehovah tonight you are called to it and you're chosen and he's the one holding us amen many times even in their struggles maybe they forgot maybe in their beatings in their whippings in Egypt maybe they forgot in the wilderness they would forgot but he didn't forget he said I have remembered my Covenant with Abraham with eyes that came with Jacob and I have come down to bring them up and what did it all brother Aaron it was Grace marvelous grace Amazing Grace brother Brown says watch when he called Abraham here he called him by election not because he was but because God was and he called him out of his people and blessed him and told him I'm going to save you oh my that's wonderful about Abraham that's wonderful about Abraham all the promises he gave to Abraham Galatians 3 29 and if ye be Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise everything he said about Abraham he said about you he said to you and to your seed I'm going to be a God to them has he been a God to us tonight has he been faithful has he seen us through has he fulfilled every promise because this Covenant is God's covenant amen the same promise that he gives to Abraham he gives to you the Royal Seed of Abraham and he says I have remembered oh that makes me feel good tonight I have remembered I haven't forgot you in your situation I haven't forgot you in the trial I haven't forgot my promise over Rapture I haven't forgotten my promise of healing I haven't forgot my promise of a body change I haven't forgot you where you're at but I am come down Hallelujah and just like Israel sometimes we may be sick but we're still chosen sometimes we may be in a dry place but we're still called sometimes we're in a great battle but I'm still his tonight Earthly circumstance and temporary circumstance do not change Eternal things I am an eternal being seen before the foundation of the world my name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life I'm called I'm chosen I'm elected I'm gonna make it because these temporary circumstances do not change Eternal things the Covenant remains true we can Rejoice tonight in that calling we can Rejoice tonight in that choosing I can Rejoice tonight that I have nothing to do with it that is the best part about it because I wouldn't mess it up but I have nothing to do with it Abraham had nothing to do with it it is elective love it is elective love brother Brown says so now it's by grace that God called you not what you did what you could do what you will do if you're the Seed of Abraham God spoke to you by his Amazing Grace just like he did Abraham in the 12th chapter of Genesis and as Abraham was called by Grace by election so was his seed called by grace and election and when God does this when God begins to move on a heart and when God begins to call and comes into Covenant with you just like with Abraham God calls for separation he calls for a separation in your life separation from the world separation from sin and separation from unbelief and and as we follow the Journey of Israel we'll see a people called to be separate just as we are called be ye separate Israel was called to separate and they are separated they don't worship like other nations do they don't live like other nations live things that are acceptable in the world is not acceptable in Israel amen they don't live like other nations and because there is a real and a living God in their midst they live to please him and he goes before them and He blesses them in battle and the whole of Israel is very aware of a living God they are very aware of the supernatural the Supernatural is not foreign to Israel they've witnessed the plagues on Egypt they've seen the waters part they've seen the walls fall down just at the sound of a trumpet they seen God go before them in battle Elijah and Elisha have walked among them the miraculous and the supernatural isn't foreign to them wherever Israel has gone the supernatural has been present the pillar of fire has been amongst them signs and wonders has been there whether it was in Egypt whether it was in the wilderness whether it was in Canaan whether it was in Israel or down in Babylon the supernatural was always present with Israel come on somebody the supernatural should always be present with the Royal Seed of Abraham it doesn't matter that we're in laodicea it doesn't matter that we're in tough conditions it doesn't matter that we're in the Lion's Den the pillar of fire was there the supernatural was always there and they were acquainted and familiar with it and God blesses them and keeps them even in their failures because they're his people they're his people can't you see yourself there tonight can't you relate to what we're talking about with Wilderness experiences dry times hard battles great trials but he was there with you all the time because we're his people he was there leading the way through it all God has been there providing through it all he's been there leading through it always been making a way through it always been healing to sick been restoring families feeling with the Holy Ghost it's an evil time but my God is still moving my God is still on the scene my God is still here and laodicea because we are his people he's never left us Israel was the Covenant people called chosen blessed and they had a promise of a messiah and scriptures that spoke of him the prophets declared him they were wanting to see him but somewhere in the waiting somewhere in the waiting for the coming of the Lord somewhere in the waiting for the Messiah somewhere in the studying and the teaching and the learning the expectations of what God would do and how God would act and how these scriptures would be fulfilled got all twisted up they got disjointed and they got misinterpreted and they got misplaced things that brother Brown said we can never do and they weren't studying to be bad people they weren't reading the prophet to be bad people they loved God they worshiped God they lived good lives but somewhere in the waiting their expectations got off how would God move how does God operate what's he going to do when he comes on the scene somewhere in the waiting it all became intellectual It came it became about how well you could quote the prophets it became about how holy you could live about how good you could be and God's chosen people became arrogant in their choosing they became arrogant in their calling listen sometimes we get to the point that we're arrogant in our calling not even not even so much as we're in the messenger and you're not but sometimes even in conversation of oh well this happened in this oh what church do they go to oh that's yeah okay you are who you are and you are where you are by God's calling and God's choosing if you are anything or you overcome anything it is God that has done it if your eyes are open it's God that has done it if you're saved it's God that has done it we have no reason to be arrogant if anything we should be on our knees each and every day thank you Jesus I love you Lord why me Lord I'm so thankful I'm so grateful it's so wonderful Lord of all the people you could have chose you chose me I have nothing to do with it I was worthless I'm a worm but you chose me you chose me instead of grace and mercy instead of an incredible feeling of Wonder and thanks that God would choose it became we are God's chosen people we are better than you God will come to us and us alone and he will only work here and in our Temple and in our synagogues listen it should thrill our hearts each and every day that we are called it should thrill our hearts that we are chosen we should never lose the Wonder of it the joy of it the excitement of it the Thanksgiving of it we can never allow it to turn into entitlement well God's going to take care of me because I'm God chosen people well God's not going to let anything happen to me I'm the bride and and I can't be wrong I can't see things wrong apparently you can you're seeing it wrong already yeah we can't allow it to turn into an entitlement looking down our nose at others because as we said if we are anything it's all him if we are anything it's all Grace and yet through this time of the waiting and waiting on the Messiah to come on the come on the scene they became entitled and they bound themselves tight in Traditions they took truths from the word and used it to bind anytime the word is used to bind anything other than the devil it is being misused if you take the word and use it against your brother it is being misused you take the word and use it to bind Worship in the house of God it is being misused the only thing we should be bonding with the word is the devil bonding evil spirits bonding sickness bonding the pornography that runs rampant bonding depression binding anxiety loosing the people of God not using the word of God to bind the people of God but they began to use it to buy not only themselves but others and it became all about the law and not the one who gave the law it became about the rules it became about the rituals it became about the traditions and they weren't really looking for the Messiah anymore maybe they said they were they said they were looking for a messiah but they had become comfortable in their life of rules and traditions and Holiness and piety they had become comfortable in that feeling like they had done enough comfortable in their calling comfortable in their choosing comfortable that we're God's people and they began to settle down to where they weren't really seeking the Messiah anymore they were just looking to live their life according to Traditions be good be holy be kind do what the prophet said brother Aaron these don't sound like bad things they're not they're wonderful things they're awesome things be good be kind do what the prophet said live according to the law of Moses but what I see lacking and all that is where is the supernatural where did they get away from the god that that rained down plagues on Egypt where did they get away from the god that opened the Red Sea where did they get away from the god that fed them man and the rock that followed them in the wilderness where did they get away from that God to where they no longer expected those things to happen and their expectations became cold their expectations became formal their expectations became tradition their expectation became Wednesday and Sunday church when did it change in the waiting for the Messiah in the delay as they waited for him to come they had seen him move on their behalf Time After Time but at some point they quit expecting God to move like that anymore at some point it became all about the word oh brother Aaron that's a dangerous statement we'll get there I have quotes for it it became all about the word study the word live the word study the word study the word get in the word I can put a pin through a scroll and tell you what words it hit because I studied the word I studied the word it's all about the word at some point it became all about the prophet's message what do you mean where you want the message but not the Fulfillment of that message they didn't want the Fulfillment of the Old Testament they wanted the Old Testament and we got people that love the quotes and they love the tapes and they love the books but they don't want the Fulfillment of the message they don't want the message with skin on it but I'm here to declare it's too bad because here we are this is the Fulfillment of the message you are the message this is what it was called to produce Jesus again on the earth they didn't like him showing up then they don't like you showing up now but here we are it's too late we are the Fulfillment it came off the pages it came off the tapes and here it is I'm sorry if I disappoint you you don't always just make me thrilled either but here we are it is what it is somebody has to fulfill the word at some point it just became going to synagogue and believe God sent a prophet know the Mysteries claim the message live clean and holy and you're going in a rapture I hate to tell you but that's not the truth but brother Aaron aren't all those things good things yes they're wonderful things but somewhere in our waiting our expectations have gotten off I want to tell you tonight he still moves the way he's always moved he still heals the way he's always healed he still saves the way he always saved and he still feels with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the way he always has and that is the expectation of the broad we're not stopping short of the new birth what do we got to have the new birth the Holy Ghost the token and without it you are lost but I live the rules I listen the tapes I come to church I worship I'm glad you do but are you born again have you had the new birth have you had that experience that is our expectation nothing short of that anything less than that is the expectation of the Pharisees it's not it's not to be our expectation is it to be just just a good life our expectation isn't to be that we're just different from others our expectation isn't is it satisfied and God called me you're not saved in your calling are you born again brother Brown says certainly those Pharisees and Sadducees why they know more about the word than any of our Scholars will ever know but they didn't know Jesus he says to know the word is not life I'm gonna say that again to know the word is not life this is your prophet to know your catechisms is not life to know your church doctrine is not life but to know him is life do you know him the prophet says and I Echo that tonight do you know him I'm not asking do you believe the message I'm not asking are you a good person I'm not asking how much you come to church I'm asking you do you know him tonight do you know Jesus have you met him for yourself have you had the new birth that is our expectation that is our calling that is our Victory the new birth John 3 and 3 Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God we have to keep our expectations right the expectation isn't just good kids the expectation isn't just good morals and good homes the expectation is when Jesus comes lives are changed there is a new birth and there is a life that is filled with the Holy Ghost but I'll tell you where the problem is the problem comes from the top down the people's expectations are wrong because it ain't preached right it's from the top down if we don't preach the new birth if we don't preach the supernatural then how can we blame the people when they don't accept it when they don't have it I'll tell you the problem is a lot of weak pulpits it is our responsibility to declare truth you will not make it without the new birth you must have the experience you must meet him for yourself you must be sealed with the Holy Ghost God does still move like he always did he still feels he still heals he still delivers he is the same may it always be declared in this church may it always be declared from this Pulpit you will be without excuse because we're here to tell you he is the same yesterday today and forever if we don't preach the supernatural in our midst then we don't expect it then we don't get it and we miss it preachers Dads Moms leaders what are our expectations what are we striving to see in our lives what is it that you want to see in your children's lives what are your expectations for this service tonight what did you expect when you came here or did you even give it a thought have you slipped into the pharisaic mindset of we're just going to church this is what we do did you even think about the service are you here just because it's Wednesday and that's what we do I'm thankful for that because there's a lot of people that this is Wednesday and it's what we do and they didn't show up at least you got them beat today I had to be here I'm kidding sure we come to church it is what we do sure it is we're coming no matter what but we should come with expectations we should come expecting something from God are you expecting him to move tonight are you expecting the Rapture to come tomorrow are you expecting it are you expecting a new birth what do we and here's where we can look at our expectations where have we gotten to where what is it that allows us to classify someone as a believer because they accept that God sent a prophet oh there are they have we lowered our expectations what is a Christian what is an overcomer have we allowed those things to fall off we said where did Israel get off I say where did we get off where did our expectations change in the waiting in the waiting listen at Pentecost they knew that they had to be endued from Power with power from on high in the first age they knew that they had to be born again and they expected it and they got it but even there that was the expectation in the first age but even there somewhere they allowed the expectations to change in that first age it became about church attendance it became about a form of godliness coldness crept in Services became formal ceremony form rituals and works took the place of the Holy Spirit don't let our expectation change don't let our standards come down God still moves God still requires the token and if God still requires the token I'm here to tell you he still gives the token he doesn't require something that he won't give you he requires it but he's here tonight going yes I require it yes you'll never make it without it but here I am saying you can have it it's yours I still pour it out I still move in Services just like this I still take somebody that's been sitting there 25 years and sitting on a bench called informal and filling with the Holy Ghost I still do it when did it become a dress code in a list of rules and Hyper legalism when did it become just know the word listen Israel's expectations had lowered and it was no longer a living God but it just became a god of the prophets from days gone by and now we just have to try to live holy just try to live according to what the scripture says and in all that they miss him and all that he walks right amongst them and they miss him how many times can he walk right amongst us and we miss him because we're not expecting him you know how it is when you're not expecting company and all since my bangs on the door who is that who's coming my house ain't ready ain't nothing everything's in disarray I mean not at my house I'm just talking about like y'all's house you know how it is but if you're expecting him to move then you recognize here he comes I see him coming down the driveway I already got it ready I'm waiting for him I'm opening the door come on in come on and move on my life move on my heart in this service deliver me tonight move from my family tonight well how come stuff's always happening for this one and not when they're expecting it to happen and they open the front door and they say come in and move in my life come in and move in my home and so guess what he does it he does it because they expect him to it's not a hope so they're looking for him they became so sure of their calling so arrogant that they were chosen so confident in their superb knowledge their knowledge of the word that they couldn't be taught I mean what Revelation could you give them think about what could you have told a Pharisee imagine trying to witness to one you could not have said anything that he didn't either a correct you or B say yeah I know that that's exactly what it says what Revelation could you give them what Supernatural could persuade them they didn't need the supernatural because they had the word brother Brown says when Jesus came he was just as fundamental as the Pharisees listen to this the Pharisees couldn't believe it but Jesus was fundamental but there were signs and wonders following his ministry where the Pharisees had the word just the same as he had now the Pharisees were off no they was no they weren't off matter of fact they were spot on they had the word just the same as he had but it's a spiritual revelation and they couldn't be led when people become so supremely confident in their works so supremely confident in their knowledge when they are confident that there is nothing outside their interpretation then they reject the leadership of the spirit because we've got it figured out we live so holy look I haven't cut my hair since I was born my skirts touched the floor I've never said a curse word I pray three times a day I've never missed a service and are you born again that's what I want to know I don't care about your works now if you're born again The Works will follow he says in the first time that the church lets their leaders take over to lead the people the Holy Spirit gets right away from them and the very first time that you go being led by man instead of God the holy spirit will get away from you too let the Holy Spirit lead that's what we need as leadership and God gave us a leader and we don't hear it listen Revelation is of the utmost importance brother Branham deals with a lot in the church age book where he says you could never pray too much for revelation you could never ask for too much Revelation because your knowledge won't do it I don't care how much you read how much you study how many sermons you listen to you will never even be in the same ballpark with the Pharisees you would not even be able to sit down and have an intelligent religious conversation with them and what good did it do them because there was no spirit and there was no revelation brother Brown says no one can doubt but the scribes and Pharisees and the great Scholars of the Year 33 A.D knew the exact laws of grammar and the exact meaning of the words in which the Old Testament was written but for all their superb knowledge they missed the revelation of God's promised word manifested in the Sun there he was set forth from Genesis to Malachi with whole chapters devoted to him and his ministry and yet except for a few who were illuminated by the spirit they missed him entirely and tonight the holy spirit's trying to illuminate you and say don't go the way of the Pharisees called so were the Pharisees they were they were the Covenant people and they knew it called chosen God's people Covenant people Supreme knowledge holy life and missed it and we want to point to our righteousness and how good we live and why we're better than somebody else in the church because of their struggles and their ups and their failures you know we often look at the Pharisees as the bad guys when we read the the Bible because of what we read about them in the New Testament and truly that they're not the protagonist of the story there's there's no doubt as it relates to to Jesus and in his crucifixion yes they are the bad guys but to me they serve as a great cautionary story because of how close they are to us oh and they're the bad guys as a matter of fact you are of your father the devil and yet how close they are in the parallels that you can see between them and us we are the Covenant people Royal Seed of Abraham and listen I believe we will not fall the prophet of God said we're predestinated not to fall but we can't sit back in the world we're called and we're chosen so we're going to make an attitude no sir that's not the attitude the attitude is I will take more today I will progress more today I will learn more today I will be revelated more today I will seek more of the Holy Spirit today not I'm called and chosen so here we go we can't settle because we're chosen and I want to look at the Pharisees for for a minute a little closer maybe we can get a different idea about who they were just to be a little historical for a second they were the Covenant people and they knew it they could even look at our opening scriptures that we read tonight and see who they were and that they were God's people the Pharisees emerged around 150 BCE and promoted the idea of Priestly Purity for all Jews they believe that their life and their worship to God should extend beyond the temple they did not believe in Sunday Wednesday religion they believed you should live for God each and every day not just in the temple that Holiness and piety wasn't just for the priest but it was for everyone even the common people man these guys sound terrible don't they the Pharisees were of the Common People the Pharisees included people of all classes in all professions Pharisees were in a sense blue-collar Jews who adhered to such things as individual prayer and assembling themselves together in synagogues can't disagree with them on anything yet this put them at Great odds with the Sadducees who were comprised of priests and social Elites and were responsible for maintaining the temple they believed that Temple worship was all that mattered so already the Pharisees got to step up on the Sadducees as far as I'm concerned Sadducees just as long as you sacrifice you can live how you won't do what you want don't matter this is all that matters that was their attitude they were elitist who wanted to maintain the Priestly cast but they were also liberal talking about the Sadducees in their willingness to incorporate Hellenism into their lives Hellenism was Greek culture they were all about bringing the culture of the world into the church the very rise of the Pharisees was to combat the Greek effort to hellenize the Jews in other words to make the Jews conform to the modern culture that's the very reason that that people stood up and said we're not going to take this this is not what we're about because all the Jews began to love Greek culture and they were quickly giving over to it they were accepting Pagan rituals they were worshiping many gods just like the Greeks and the Sadducees were just going along with it the Sadducees were just living this lukewarm kind of Life letting the world creep in acting like the world worshiping like the world living like the world and a group began to rise up that saw corruption in the temple they saw corruption in the worship they saw lies that were slipping away from a true dedication to Jehovah and they said we must stand for truth we can't stand for this this isn't what God called us to be God called us to be separated God called us to be holy God called us not to fit in with the world and they said we're going to stand for truth no matter what the cost no matter if Society it kicks us out no matter what we have to give up if we're rejected we will not go with this modern Greek culture and they stood for truth and they look to the Covenant and the god when God made the Covenant he told Abraham separate and so they looked there and they saw that and they point back to the original back to Abraham and they recognize this isn't how Abraham lived he separated and they become known as Pharisees which comes from the word parisha which means separated ones these were the people who stood for truth they were the outcast who wouldn't go with the world and they stood up and said no Abraham was a separated one we're going to be separated once what terrible people they began to teach the importance of staying in the word of all the sects of Judaism they alone remain separated from the ways of foreign influence invading their lives in religious practice the Pharisees also maintained that there was an afterlife the Sadducees did not believe in any afterlife whatsoever the Pharisees taught there is a record there is a resurrection there is an afterlife he taught that God punished they taught that God punished the wicked and rewarded the righteous in the world to come they also believed in a coming Messiah which the Sadducees did not they studied and read and prayed so much that they gained the reputation of being experts in the law it wasn't what they were trying to do they were just in the word so much so that was the reputation that they gained they began to see themselves as experts in the law and over time in the waiting in their stand for truth in the Holding Out for the Messiah they began to trust in their goodness in their holiness you better not be trusting in your Holiness tonight you better not be trusting in your goodness tonight you better not be trusting in how clean you live you better not be making this message about do's and don'ts because you can never compare to the goodness and the Holiness of the Pharisees you'll never touch them brother Brown says you may be a member of a church that don't mean one thing you say well I live a good clean life that still don't mean one thing to God who could be any cleaner who could be any more holy speaking than those Pharisees was in that day they were blameless blameless brother Brown says as far as Holiness while they would make the Holiness Church today feel ashamed of themselves when it come to holiness they really had to live holy they lived separated consecrated lives so I tell you tonight that if righteousness was all that God required the Pharisees would be first in line the Pharisees would have it over on all of us they held on and they held on and they believed and they fought for the truth and they stood for righteousness brother Brown says those Pharisees believed in many things to be the truth now here's the turn they said we are God's children brother Brown says and they were until that word was preached but when that word was preached and Vindicated then they become sinners for rejecting the thing that they knowed was right and witnessed it we know thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do the things that you do without God being with you the Pharisees were far from being wrong as a matter of fact they were right until they rejected him truth they were fighting to protect the truth then why did they fight against Jesus because it wasn't what they expected it was contrary to their interpretation of what the prophet had said notice it wasn't contrary to what the prophet said it was contrary to the interpretation that they felt that that the prophet had said and their entire attack against Jesus was a desire to protect the truth and in their desire to protect the people and protect the truth and stand for the word they fought against the very thing they had to have oh we see it all the time in a desire to protect the people in a desire we don't want any any Wildfire loose in the church we don't want any moving of the spirit we don't want any of those gifts any desire to protect the people just in case what if it isn't what if it isn't real what if it's this and they're afraid of the very thing they need to bring life into the church they become afraid of the new birth and the very thing that they have to have they fight against the very thing that gives them a chance to overcome this world that gives them opportunity to Rapture they fight against it they stand for the truth they fight for the truth and they're scared of the new birth and get so scared of the moving of the spirit so scared so scared of everything we've got to protect the people scared that the supernatural might be out of place listen they will never deny that the supernatural operating in brother branham's Ministry they will never deny the supernatural of the past and yet question every single aspect of the supernatural in the now well I don't know about all that brother Aaron I don't know if all that's necessary just stay with the word that's exactly what the Pharisees did they just stayed with the word according to to the rabbis to disbelieve any Miracle recognized as such in the Old Testament now hear me to disbelieve any Miracle recognized as such in the Old Testament according to the Pharisees incurred the greatest possible punishment which was the loss of one's portion in the world to come if you disbelieved or doubted one of the Miracles recorded in the Old Testament doubted or disbelieved your portion in the next world was wiped away my goodness they believed in that Supernatural however disbelief in a post-biblical miracle which for them was post-old Testament incurs no punishment at all that spirit's never died oh yeah you better believe that those miracles in brother branham's they were the truth absolutely that was the truth you better believe God used to do that you better believe he used to do that but if you don't believe he does it today that's okay that's no big deal but you better believe back then you better believe God could you better believe God used to well could and used to does me no good I need God right now and I believe he still does he still will and he still is doing the same thing tonight that he did back there I choose to believe right now for my life right here in this moment why would I want to choose to believe he no longer does it he still does it says for the religious leaders of the day a supernatural feat no matter how impressive would not have any sway in a religious discussion no wonder that they didn't care what Jesus did no matter how great the miracle it would have no sway in a religious discussion whenever Miracles made their appearance trying to interfere with legal matters of the talmud they were for the most part rejected notice they didn't care that the man got healed they were just mad that he was healed on the Sabbath the miracle didn't matter you messed with the law the manifestation that he that he says I am the Lord thy God that healeth thee didn't matter you did it on the wrong day well I don't care that people got healed in that prayer line did you see how they acted people getting filled yeah people got the Holy Ghost but did you see those people running all over the building shouting and screaming I know people got delivered but are we supposed to act like that in church you Pharisee people gaining eternal life and you want to nitpick the service that they got it in instead of praising God and saying thank you Jesus that you saved somebody thank you Jesus that you healed somebody thank you Jesus that you delivered somebody let our expectations be of a God that still moves and still operates and still heals and still delivers what are our expectations for a service what are we wanting When We Gather how much are we willing to let God move when it's outside your understanding or interpretation of what church order is the Pharisees expectations of how the Messiah would conduct himself hindered them from being able to receive him well the Messiah wouldn't do this well the Messiah wouldn't do that and they sure didn't like the way people worshiped when the Messiah came around Pharisees will always be the one saying tell the people to hold their peace and Jesus said if the people hold their peace that the rocks will cry out listen what brother Brown says that's the way today when the congregation is gathered together that foreshadow of his appearing the Holy Spirit began to breathe on them they see those signs and wonders performed of the Holy Spirit they can't hold their peace something is going to cry out why were they so against the shouting why were they so against the yelling because they didn't recognize him as God had they recognized that it was God they would have acted the same way why are people so against that shouting and running and dancing and screaming in the house of God they don't recognize it's the holy spirit in our midst if they did they would do the same thing I know we've covered it we've covered we're not all going to act and worship exactly the same I understand that but you would worship with all your heart how about that there's no way that right now you could truly believe that Jesus Christ is in this room and not be all in if you're not all in it's because you don't believe he's here brother Brown says certainly it is now listen some people say it's just all emotion brother Brown says certainly it is it's something present and it is true that when the Holy Ghost comes down it stirs the crowd to emotion so you are exactly right it is all emotion now let's get into why it's all emotion because the Holy Spirit has come down and it has stirred the crowd to emotion they're setting there Anointed with the spirit of God and the Holy Ghost sweeps across them it stirs emotions it's got to he said it's got to so if you sit there emotionalists all the time I don't know what you're going to do with that because he says when the holy spirit moves on you it's got to stir your emotions I had a guy tell me one time after a service I don't even got to describe it to you as one of those Services you know what I'm talking about one of those Services we got freed and up up in here and afterwards he says well I didn't feel anything like everybody else was feeling obviously I watched them running and jumping and shot and feel a thing I mean it was a good service and all by that field nothing well certainly you didn't I wouldn't expect you to because you reviewing Jesus coming through the building the same way the Pharisees viewed him coming in riding on the coat you didn't recognize he was in the building you approached it the same way as they did in order to fill let me tell you something in order to feel it you've got to be in the spirit of worship like the ones who were shouting Hosanna brother Branham says this listen God likes to be worshiped and when you worship Him it just isn't exactly singing a song as we do but singing it in the spirit of worship you see and then you feel the Holy Spirit bounce back well I never feel anything well then I ask you how are you worshiping then you feel the Holy Spirit listen we spent a lot of time a few weeks ago and I'm about to be bringing this to a close but we spent a lot of time a few weeks ago talking about how it ain't in the run and jumping shouting dancing that none of that meant you were saved I'm gonna jump on the other side for just a minute you're perfectly clean Pious and holy perfect Church attendance life doesn't mean you're saved either you must be born again bringing this down just because you believe the message you're not saved because you live clean because you live holy and righteous listen your humility this is one that people love they're so humble that person's so humble your humility means nothing I read a quote today if you want to look it up you can it is there where brother Branham said the Pharisees were twice as humble as Jesus was they're so humble and good I guess are you born again that's the question that's what matters yes if you're born again there will come humility to your life I believe that listen I'm in no way advocating for loose living I'm in no way advocated that you shouldn't do all these things but it's got to be more than that it's got to be that he is now on the inside of me and he is living this out of me he is overcoming through me it's his righteousness it's his Holiness it's not some manufactured Holiness a manufactured come on now put on that you put on yourself it's got to be him living in you doing the works out of you because if it's just you doing the works and there's been no experience there's been no New Birth you are lost and Bound for hell I know it's rough but it's truth anyway look I I like I said I don't never want to promote loose living I'm thankful for correct Doctrine I'm thankful for the for for the parameters in the word that plainly declare what pleases God and I believe as Christians we should try to please God we should try our best what are you saying the same thing I said a couple weeks ago that you can't rest in to jump in the in the shout you can't rest in your works you can't rest and how long your skirts are or how long your hair is or boys that you don't tell bad jokes and that you read your Bible you can't rest in those things the only thing you can rest in is I've got the token I've got the new birth I'm ready to go I'm going home I'm part of the Covenant that's what you can put your rest in let me skip down some of this brother Branham says you know many times when people are real legalistic it causes them to judge other people pretty harshly well we don't do that so you shouldn't how about you worry about you quit being so quick to judge everybody around you and so quick to question well how can they be a Christian and do this or do that we would never dream of doing such a thing in our home it is a trick of the devil to get you focused on how others live and to compare your righteousness to them well I would never how can they it's a trick because no matter how clean you live and how perfect you're living it without the Holy Ghost you will in no wise enter in think about this for a second let this settle home their standards and yours may be totally different yours may be stricter and Holier and they be born again and you not brother Brown says and the legal it says I've got to do this and I must do this and I must do that then if you're not born again you're still not saved so there you are he says what you are what Calvinism is what Grace is is what God did for you but what works is is what you do for God in appreciation of what he did for you through Grace that's the whole answer now listen to this then if I'm saved then I will live like I'm saved but I could live like I'm saved and not be saved see so it's the fact then brings it to this spot he says we must be born again we must be born again Paul speaking in Philippians 3 tells us for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh he says I got more to boast about than any of y'all there's nobody can lay a finger on me I was circumcised on the Eighth Day Hebrew of Hebrews Israelite on both sides I mean his father and his mother were Pharisees from one generation to another excuse me Israelites acts 23 he says I am a Pharisee and the son of a Pharisee taught according to the perfect manner of the law Paul was blameless you couldn't accuse him of one shortcoming by anyone according to the word and yet Paul said I count all that is done that I might win Christ three and nine says and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I might know him and the power of his resurrection that's my expectation that's what I want do I want a holy life yes do I want an overcoming life yes but how am I going to get it I want to know him in the power of his resurrection I want to know him the way they knew him on the day of Pentecost I don't want our expectations to fall but we need the new birth we need the Holy Ghost we're looking what is my expectation my expectation is a Rapture my expectation is Victory my expectation is a body change my expectation is overcoming lives how how brother Aaron how are we going to do it he says you're not little bride I am I'm gonna come I'm gonna give you the new birth I'm gonna fill you with the Holy Ghost I'm gonna give you the token I'm going to move the way I always did I'm going to deliver you that is the expectation of the broad that is my expectation will you stand together with me tonight the Pharisees weren't wrong until they rejected the word manifested they were right they were righteous they were holy they were called they were Abraham's seed and let this sink in but the new birth wasn't as important to them as being called and chosen they didn't feel the need it wasn't as important as being a message believer they held to the written word over the Fulfillment of it look I get happier when I think about the fact that it's not what I can do that it's not the life I have to live that is not him up there going well he did this wrong today and he I'm glad it's not my goodness I'm glad it's all on him I'll say let it go tonight let go of what you think you have to control let go of everything you think you have to do and just wrap yourself in the grace of God wrap yourself in his righteousness tonight wrap yourself in the New Birth listen this don't make it harder this makes it so much easier I don't have to do it I don't have to do it he said I got this he said I'll take care of you listen there isn't one building one person in this building better than another there isn't one life here worthy of going to heaven which means every life here is worthy of going to hell but he said I'll make a covenant and he made a covenant there at Calvary he was torn apart and in the old days what they would do is they would stand between the beasts that had been torn apart and they would take a piece of paper they would write the Covenant on and then they would tear it and he would get one half and I would get one half and then to prove that we had the Covenant and that we were of the Covenant when I came with my peace he had to have the other peace and they had to dovetail together perfectly and on that day he was he was torn apart and his body went back into heaven but the other piece was sent down to you the Holy Ghost and on that day when he comes down he says it's Rapture Day it's body changed day I'm coming for a bride he's going I'm looking for the other piece I'm looking for the other piece there it is he's got the peace he's got the peace and he's got the pieces she's got the peace they've got the peace they're the other part that's the token they are the Covenant people oh I'm not calling you Pharisees tonight I'm saying don't be like them don't rest in that don't lower your expectations my expectation is I've got the other piece I've got the token and if you don't got it tonight get the other piece he's coming for somebody he's gonna say show me the Covenant show me the Covenant show me the token there's my life there's the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on little bride enter into the joys of the Lord that is my expectation God bless you foreign [Applause] [Music] Lord oh how

good ground of our hearts have received your word Lord we want to put it into action we want it to take over every fiber of our being Lord those that desire the baptism of the Holy Ghost may they not

our needs according to your riches in glory Lord we receive it tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you tonight why don't you have your seats those that do need to go and just slip out just do so quietly and reverently but the Daryl is going to come and talk to us about the events coming up this weekend so if you'd like to stay for that we'd certainly appreciate that for sure isn't the Lord good to us man it's been a wonderful service tonight and God bless you all sure good to be here tonight what a wonderful time in the Lord that we had so thankful for his grace in my life and what he's done I just want his grace amen nothing that I can do but it's what he's done it's so appreciate brother Aaron and the message I wanted to talk to you all about our work day that we have coming up Saturday uh we're wanting to start early the heat is pretty rough right now a lot of humidity and a lot of heat so we're going to try to start around 6 30. Saturday morning I have a list put together some of you may have seen it but we wanted to put it up on the screen if you could put that up Sister Joanna these are some of the things that we're wanting to try to accomplish Saturday and we had everybody stay because it's not just for the brothers there are some things that the sisters can do if some of you sisters want to come out and we'll get to that but a lot of it is uh just stuff that's kind of happened with the storm that we had a lot of damage so a lot of this stuff is driven by that and then there's just some other things that have come along too so we're wanting to try to get this done you can see the first one uh the sign out here we had damage from the storm we're wanting to get everything torn out so that we can start the Reconstruction we're going to be constructing it just a little differently so we want to tear everything out and kind of be starting from scratch so we're going to have a trailer out here I believe brother Steven's going to have a dump trailer that we can put all the stuff that we tear off in to get it away and then we also have AC condenser unit that was damaged in the storm we're wanting to try to get that replaced I believe it's on order I don't know if it'll be here in time so that'll be another thing that we'll just have to see if we get the parts in we got thermostats that we want to replace in some of the areas to try to get those working on the network we have the fence row that is over here on 371 that is grown up we've got a lot of stuff in it when we get our sign up it's going to be a little lower so we're wanting to get that cleared out plus it'll just look nice so that's going to be a lot of manual labor so we're wanting to start early on that as well um we've got some dirt and erosion in the driveway entrance that we're wanting to fix Brother David Mitchell is going to try to be here with a little Trico excavator that we make in uh move that along a little faster than doing it by hand we'll be working on that and we have lights in the sanctuary that are out from electrical issue that we had a lightning or whatever so we want to try to get those replaced some of these we've gotten done I believe brother Mike Wares already agrees the casters but uh we have the sanctuary wall mounters we have one out so we're wanting to put a projector in so there's going to be a lot of work in the attic to get the infrastructure up there so that those can be hung so we're wanting to try to accomplish that we have a damaged fence around the septic system that we recently put in and the storm blew a lot of that away there's I believe two sections missing the rest of them are there but it'll have to be put back up is that something that you'll be able to kind of head up or will you be available okay all right so we'll get somebody on that what we're going to try to do is take a few people maybe and run point on these projects and get Brothers to kind of help gather and get groups together and work on each project so we can do them simultaneous there's some ceiling tile missing in here in the platform entrance and a couple others have water damage that we want to replace four by fours around the swing area we've got the nice swings and all set up the brothers worked on we're wanting to put four by fours around it and we have the sb2 out here that we'll have a tractor and we'll put that in place um we have a hole that we want to dig for a concrete acre for our cargo trailer we got a new one because others were damaged in the storm we're wanting to have a way to maybe secure it down so if we have another strong wind it won't blow this one away and damage it and then the sisters we have in the fellowship hall and the kitchen is really where we want to concentrate there's a lot of cleaning can be done that area we have sister Lydia that takes care of the church area in here in the sanctuary in different places but that doesn't include our fellowship hall in the kitchen so it's kind of a effort from everybody to take care of those so we're wanting to get sisters to come in and maybe help clean that area up mop the fellowship hall maybe organizing the kitchen where things have gotten in disarray so those are some of the things that we're looking at doing if there's more time or more available there's a lot of cleaning in the gym same thing with that it's not really an area that's regularly maintained but we want to work on that as well so we have the pit ball area I skipped that um brother Jimbo you had you had kind of run point on that and built it but we need a few extra boards on that are you able to be here Saturday okay we'll see if you'll let me know what we need maybe we can get stuff picked up and any supplies that any of you need for any of the projects let me know we'll make sure that we have some of that available if you're not picking it up yourself so can I just see maybe a show of hands who would be able to come out Saturday so we kind of have an idea what to expect as far as help so we've got probably about 15 16. okay all right well that is all I have I sure appreciate everybody and everybody coming out don't know how long it'll take we'll just be here until but we do want to start at 6 30 try to get ahead of the heat on some of these projects especially the attic projects and the outside projects so God bless you and we'll see y'all Saturday morning
