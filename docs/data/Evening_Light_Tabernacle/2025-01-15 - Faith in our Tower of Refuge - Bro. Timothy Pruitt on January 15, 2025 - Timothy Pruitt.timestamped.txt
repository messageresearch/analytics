[41:37] out of nowhere a storm hit us and it was
[41:40] very high winds it was terrifying and
[41:43] the building was shaking and and things
[41:45] were happening you could hear screams
[41:47] all around but that building was not
[41:50] moved I mean it was it was shaking in
[41:52] the cist but it it did not move it off
[41:54] its foundation it was terrible outside
[41:57] but you know we came through that storm
[42:00] unharmed and I remember as I was waking
[42:03] up remarking as we were talking and
[42:05] different ones gathered around and
[42:07] admiring this building how it was the
[42:09] roof was attached and I remember seeing
[42:12] Nails nailed in certain places and and
[42:15] and and things put in a certain way and
[42:18] we were marveling how bad the storm was
[42:20] but how well this building did and how
[42:24] we were protected and we were okay
[42:27] and I got to thinking about that has
[42:29] been on my heart this week as I I know a
[42:32] lot of folks are in storms of life we're
[42:34] all in one great storm called Leo DEA uh
[42:38] it's the Winds of hell that are blowing
[42:41] around and you know in the storm is not
[42:43] getting any less but it's getting
[42:45] greater uh the storms of sin are pushing
[42:49] harder the storms of sicknesses are
[42:51] coming harder but I'm thankful that we
[42:53] have a place of refuge and it's not just
[42:56] a place place that we can we have to
[42:58] worry about with this hold or with this
[43:01] this be able to stand the storm but it
[43:03] is proven throughout history that it can
[43:05] stand the storms of life and it's a
[43:08] strong tower it is the greatest defense
[43:11] that we have to fight against Satan is
[43:14] the name of the Lord amen and we know
[43:16] the name of the Lord is Jesus Christ and
[43:19] there's no name that is higher there's
[43:21] no name that is greater there's no name
[43:23] that is more powerful than the name of
[43:26] Jesus Amen and the scripture here is
[43:28] describing the name that name as a
[43:31] strong tower other translations for
[43:33] strong tower are a place of protection a
[43:36] a a fortified Tower a strong Fortress a
[43:40] tower of strength it means actually to
[43:42] be set safely and securely on high in
[43:46] other words too high to be captured or
[43:49] in other words too strong to be
[43:51] accessible by the enemy it's a place
[43:54] that is elevated above the trouble now
[43:57] you say how can that be we're in a time
[43:59] of trouble sure but it's a place though
[44:01] we're in trouble and it may be all
[44:03] around you it cannot grab you and take
[44:06] you down Amen in other words it's around
[44:09] you that that that trouble that's around
[44:11] you may scream it may holler it may make
[44:14] threats but it cannot capture you
[44:17] because you're in a place of safety and
[44:20] what what we need for our Victory is
[44:23] inside of that tower inside of that
[44:26] Tower is every word we need for healing
[44:29] for deliverance for salvation inside of
[44:32] that Tower the name of Jesus Christ is
[44:35] everything that we have need of between
[44:37] here and the Rapture I believe in that
[44:39] Tower there's enough there's enough
[44:41] power Amen in that Tower to set every
[44:44] sinner free to heal every sick person
[44:47] Amen to bring back every person that's
[44:49] backsliding in a way from God I believe
[44:52] there's enough power in that name amen
[44:55] there may be other names that have been
[44:57] been powerful upon the Earth amen names
[44:59] of kings and names of conquerors but
[45:01] there's no greater name than the name of
[45:04] Jesus at the very mention of that name
[45:07] every demon trembles every demon backs
[45:10] up because it he knows the power that is
[45:13] represented in that name and I I was
[45:16] looking at the different scriptures as
[45:18] we go through this and I was looking at
[45:20] a scripture in Judges chapter 9 and
[45:22] verse 50 it was a king that came against
[45:25] the city and he began to begin to go
[45:28] encamp about it and he took it but
[45:31] inside of this city in verse 51 was
[45:33] there was a strong tower in the city
[45:36] thither fled all the men and women and
[45:39] all they that were of the city and shut
[45:41] it shut it to them and got them up to
[45:44] the top of the tower and a bimc came
[45:46] into the tower now I I was doing a lot
[45:49] of study on this actually and me in
[45:51] almost every city in that in that
[45:53] culture there was always a strong tower
[45:56] to run up into to amen so they would run
[45:58] up into this place because they knew if
[46:01] they could get up in there so high place
[46:03] is a strong place and the enemy cannot
[46:06] just easily come up to where you're at
[46:08] without you being a defendant so here
[46:10] aimc comes against the tower and he
[46:13] comes against and he fights against it
[46:15] and he comes hard to the door and he's
[46:16] trying to burn it with fire but inside
[46:19] of that Tower was something for their
[46:21] Deliverance inside of that Tower amen
[46:24] was a a stone that was there and this
[46:27] woman actually grabs his Stone and comes
[46:29] up to the window and she looks over the
[46:32] tower and there's aimc coming against
[46:34] the door and she just gets this Stone
[46:37] and she just drops it down and it lands
[46:39] upon his head and it crushes him down
[46:41] and he says to his sword Bearer he says
[46:44] please will you just stab me cuz I don't
[46:46] want to be told about me that I was
[46:48] killed by a woman and I thought about
[46:50] that you know as as we're pushed into
[46:52] this Tower or we run into this Tower
[46:55] amen as the Bible says a bright just run
[46:57] in and are safe and we get inside of
[46:59] this Tower I want you to understand when
[47:01] you're inside this Tower you're not
[47:03] helpless when you're inside this Tower
[47:06] there's something there already provided
[47:09] for your
[47:11] Victory if you can see it and you can
[47:13] grab a hold of it and you can just place
[47:16] it upon your hands and you can look out
[47:18] the window as it were and drop it upon
[47:20] your enemy maybe it's a word of of of
[47:23] God that has been ministered to you over
[47:25] this pull pit or or a word that has been
[47:28] given to you in this Bible there's power
[47:30] that is there to defeat your
[47:33] enemy amen and so as we look at this
[47:37] thought Amen in in Psalms chapter 20 and
[47:39] verse one the Lord hear thee in the day
[47:42] of trouble and the name of God of Jacob
[47:45] defend thee now if you look at that word
[47:47] defend thee you wouldn't think of it as
[47:49] being a tower but this actually this
[47:52] word defend the how they used it it
[47:54] actually means to be raised or to be
[47:56] exalted to be put higher to defend it
[48:00] refers to the physical size indicating
[48:03] great height City walls in a figurative
[48:06] sense it indicates a high impregnable
[48:09] City or habitation so God has put you in
[48:13] a place in his habitation in his word
[48:16] where the enemy can come against it but
[48:18] they will not Prevail they can come
[48:21] against it but it will stand they can
[48:23] come against it but it will not fall to
[48:25] the ground sir amen amen hallelujah
[48:28] Psalm 61 says the end of the Earth will
[48:31] I cry unto thee when my heart is
[48:33] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is
[48:36] higher than I for thou H has been a
[48:38] shelter for me and a strong tower from
[48:41] the enemy and I will abide in thy
[48:43] Tabernacle forever I will trust in the
[48:46] covert of thy Wings saah Psalm 18 and
[48:49] verse 2 says the Lord is my rock and my
[48:52] Fortress and my deliverer my God my
[48:55] strength in whom my trust my Buckler and
[48:58] the Horn of my salvation and my high
[49:03] tower almost every one of these you look
[49:05] at it describes it not just as a to
[49:08] Tower but as a high tower as a place of
[49:12] elevation that the enemy cannot get to
[49:15] you we can read in Psalms 91 and I I
[49:18] know personally this brother Ron
[49:20] Spencer's favorite scripture Psalms 91
[49:23] and verse one he that dwelleth in the
[49:25] secret place of the most high I shall
[49:27] abide under the shadow of the almighty
[49:30] and I will say of the Lord he is my
[49:32] refuge and my Fortress my God in him
[49:36] will I
[49:38] trust amen I I I guess the Lord wanted
[49:40] y'all to hear this because he gave it to
[49:41] you in the song now he's given to you in
[49:43] scripture right I will say of the Lord
[49:46] he is my refuge and my Fortress my God
[49:49] in him will I trust surely he will
[49:52] deliver thee From The Snare of the
[49:54] Fowler and from the noise of pest
[49:57] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[49:58] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[50:01] truth shall be thy shield and buckler
[50:03] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[50:05] by night nor the arrow that fth by day
[50:08] nor the pestilence that walketh in
[50:10] darkness nor the destruction that waits
[50:11] to that noon day a thousand may fall at
[50:14] thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand
[50:16] but it shall not come nigh thee Only
[50:19] With Thine Eyes shall thou behold and
[50:21] see the reward of the wicked because
[50:23] thou Hast made the Lord Which is my
[50:26] Refuge even the most high thy
[50:30] habitation amen there shall no evil
[50:32] befall thee neither shall any plague
[50:34] come now thy dwelling for he shall give
[50:36] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[50:39] in all thy ways and they shall bear thee
[50:41] up in their hands lest they thou Dash
[50:44] thy foot against a stone Thou shalt
[50:46] tread upon the lion and the adder and
[50:48] the Young Lion and dragon shalt th
[50:50] trample under feet because he has set
[50:52] his love upon me therefore will I
[50:55] deliver him notice that changes from
[50:58] from David speaking to God speaking
[51:00] because he set his love upon me
[51:02] therefore will I deliver him and I will
[51:06] set him on
[51:08] high and I will set him on high because
[51:12] he has know my
[51:14] name amen because he has known my name
[51:17] who I am what's in my name the power
[51:20] that's there amen the victory that's
[51:22] there the the peace that's there
[51:24] therefore since he knows who I am I will
[51:27] set him in the place of
[51:30] safety he shall call upon me and I will
[51:33] answer him I will be with him in trouble
[51:35] and I will deliver him and honor him
[51:38] with long life will I satisfy him and
[51:40] show him my salvation I don't know about
[51:43] you but I believe eternal life is long
[51:46] life you can live 90 years old 95 100
[51:50] years that's not very long in the grand
[51:52] scheme of things amen but eternal life
[51:56] that's long life amen you know and so we
[52:00] look at it in 1 Corinthians 10 now you
[52:02] say well brother Timothy I'm going
[52:03] through a lot of things I got a lot of
[52:05] Trials I got a lot of things things are
[52:06] going on in my family
[52:08] situation 1 Corinthians 10:13 says there
[52:11] is no temptation taking you but such as
[52:15] common to man in other words you're not
[52:17] dealing with things nobody else has ever
[52:19] dealt
[52:21] with and the same God that was faithful
[52:23] for them is the same God that's going to
[52:26] be faith faithful for
[52:27] you amen but God is faithful who will
[52:31] not suffer you to be tempted above
[52:34] that's right you hear that above that
[52:38] which you're able in other words he's
[52:40] not going to allow the temptation to get
[52:43] above
[52:44] you he's not going to allow it to get
[52:47] over you and rule over you and rule over
[52:49] your life and it's everything that it
[52:52] just dictates everything you do the
[52:54] Temptation doesn't and the trial does
[52:56] and the devil over your life he's not
[52:58] going to allow it to get above
[53:01] you but as the Temptation gets higher
[53:04] he's going to lift you higher as the
[53:07] Temptation gets greater he's going to
[53:10] lift you up greater come on somebody
[53:13] amen God is not going to allow you to be
[53:15] bent over to Satan's Temptation and
[53:18] Satan's trial and be subject to it he's
[53:21] already set you free that's right
[53:24] therefore he's not going to allow you to
[53:25] come under his subjection any longer
[53:28] amen he may try to put sickness on it
[53:30] but he's not going to allow that
[53:31] sickness to rule you that's right amen
[53:34] he may put trials upon you but he's not
[53:36] going to let those trials rule you but
[53:38] he's going to lift you up above
[53:42] them that's right she's not going to let
[53:44] suffer you be tempted above that you are
[53:51] able God always makes a way of
[53:55] Escape always look to the Bible it's
[53:58] always though Satan May pin you in a
[54:00] corner he says with cancer God Will Make
[54:03] A Way of
[54:05] Escape

[54:10] dealt with cancer but those who have
[54:11] maybe you can say Amen pretty good at
[54:13] that cuz he made a made a way of Escape
[54:15] Satan May pin you under a car God Will
[54:18] Make A Way of Escape Satan may have
[54:19] taken your family away from you but God

[54:24] Escape God always has a
[54:29] way God is never out of ideas that's
[54:33] he's never having to come up with new
[54:36] ideas amen he's never he's never worried
[54:39] about a situation he knows exactly how
[54:41] it's going to work out and it's going to
[54:43] work out for your
[54:49] good you know Moses and Israel was in
[54:52] the line of duty one time and they came
[54:54] right up in in the pillar of Fire was
[54:56] leading them here they were the prophet

[55:00] leading them and it led them right down

[55:30] you in between opinions well that could
[55:32] just be this that could just be he put
[55:34] you in a trap to see what kind of
[55:36] decision you're going to make right see

[55:42] let it get that way he brought Israel
[55:45] right down into a trap mountains and
[55:47] deserts on both sides Pharaoh's Army
[55:49] behind and the Red Sea right in front of
[55:52] them that's they were trapped on all
[55:55] sides it look like God was a terrible
[55:57] military
[55:58] General he left his people with no
[56:03] retreat you see that's a that's a that's
[56:05] a thought many times in military you

[56:09] Fire gets too bad if the fight gets too
[56:12] rough you're looking for a what well can
[56:14] I can I move this way and can I back out
[56:16] this way you're always looking for that
[56:18] but sometimes God allows it he lets the
[56:20] doctor walk away and say just said to
[56:23] you you can't live you're going to die
[56:25] the cancer is going toat eat you up
[56:27] you'll never get out of that chair he
[56:28] seems to leave you with no

[56:39] retreat Hallelujah medical science is
[56:42] not our
[56:43] Retreat we thank God for medical science

[1:00:32] said I got all wound up you know Baptist
[1:00:35] sitting there looking at me and Holy
[1:00:37] Ghost came down on on me and I jumped
[1:00:39] out in the middle of the aisle and I
[1:00:40] began to speak in tongues and I thought
[1:00:43] well what is happening to me I never
[1:00:45] knew anything about it when I started
[1:00:46] back I heard my lips say this I'm a rock
[1:00:49] in a weary land a refuge in the time of
[1:00:52] storm oh how I wondered everyone look
[1:00:55] look at at one another like geese in a
[1:00:57] yard looking at each other looking like
[1:00:59] that and I felt the same way because I
[1:01:00] didn't know but something had happened
[1:01:02] to me I had found the
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:06] tower come on somebody it makes a
[1:01:10] difference when you have found the tower
[1:01:12] when you have found the place of safety

[1:01:17] it in drugs or alcohol or whatever else
[1:01:20] Amen to try to appease your life and to
[1:01:23] make peace with your enemies but all of
[1:01:25] a sudden one day I found the tower and I
[1:01:29] realized when I got inside of that the
[1:01:31] devil couldn't get to me no
[1:01:35] more hallelujah amen that spot is a
[1:01:39] blessed hiding
[1:01:41] place if you ever come to Christ if God
[1:01:44] it's God's provided place of safety the
[1:01:47] name of the where he said the name of
[1:01:48] the Lord is a mighty tower the righteous
[1:01:50] run into and are safe in the time of
[1:01:53] sicknesses when stri when sickness
[1:01:55] strikes the doctor says there's nothing
[1:01:57] else I can do about it you don't got to
[1:02:00] build up a lot of pressure just let off
[1:02:02] the
[1:02:04] pressure yeah let off the pressure a lot
[1:02:09] of pressure in these days we're living
[1:02:10] in ain't it pressures of all kinds
[1:02:13] coming from every
[1:02:16] direction it's what happens when a storm
[1:02:19] comes the pressure
[1:02:22] changes if I if I remember correctly
[1:02:25] they used to talk about in school when I
[1:02:27] was in school he said if a tornado was
[1:02:30] to come you're supposed to let up the
[1:02:31] windows a little bit fire if it was a
[1:02:33] fire you close the
[1:02:35] windows and why it's because of the
[1:02:38] pressures and they're trying to allow
[1:02:40] for those pressures because when a
[1:02:43] tornado comes it changes the pressure of
[1:02:45] a building to where actually it can just
[1:02:47] explode it looks like it just blows
[1:02:49] apart why because of the pressure and
[1:02:53] this is what we're seeing people do in
[1:02:55] this day they're they're exploding
[1:02:56] because of the pressure they tried on
[1:02:59] their own they tried by their own
[1:03:01] achievements they tried by their own
[1:03:02] knowledge and and they listen it doesn't
[1:03:04] matter how much money you got you can
[1:03:06] still commit suicide it doesn't matter
[1:03:09] how good you got it you can still give
[1:03:11] yourself to every devil in hell amen why
[1:03:13] because of the
[1:03:15] pressures and Satan has designed this
[1:03:18] world to be full of
[1:03:21] pressure
[1:03:22] yes and the storm comes it seems like
[1:03:25] the pressure pressure is about to just
[1:03:27] blow you
[1:03:28] up wonder how am I going to stand this
[1:03:32] tell you how you going to do it he's
[1:03:34] going to just lift you up a little
[1:03:40] higher when you're in this

[1:11:17] coming through well you so I I'll be
[1:11:19] nervous Oh no you're in a
[1:11:22] refuge you're not maybe
[1:11:25] you're going to die and you you got to
[1:11:28] go some way but just you're in the
[1:11:31] Refuge so feel
[1:11:32] safe that's right you're safe as long as
[1:11:35] you're in the Refuge CU God cares about
[1:11:37] you you say well you mean when the death
[1:11:39] Angel's knocking at the door I don't
[1:11:41] have to get all steamed up about it no
[1:11:43] not a
[1:11:45] bit well wait a
[1:11:48] minute let's take Israel for a moment
[1:11:51] when they were down in Egypt and the
[1:11:52] Death Angel started coming through but
[1:11:55] they they were in a place of Refuge if
[1:11:57] they done what the word
[1:11:59] said they could be in a house and still
[1:12:02] the death angel could enter but if they
[1:12:04] had done what the word said and took his
[1:12:07] faith and dipped it in the blood and put
[1:12:09] it over their door then their house
[1:12:12] became a place of Refuge it came a place
[1:12:15] that the death angel could not enter in
[1:12:18] amen and so when death was coming to the
[1:12:20] door and maybe this little boy looking
[1:12:23] out the window he could see that dark SP
[1:12:25] Dark Angel and says daddy do you love me
[1:12:27] sure son I love you Daddy I I I'm your
[1:12:30] firstborn I I'm you are son that's right
[1:12:33] look here Daddy the Angels got that

[1:12:37] played with him and he's coming he's
[1:12:39] coming toward the house daddy you you
[1:12:42] what but son do you see that
[1:12:46] doorpost Daddy will he give me no he
[1:12:49] can't get you that's right why can't he
[1:12:52] because I have done what the prophet
[1:12:54] said
[1:12:55] I have applied it as he said when I see
[1:12:58] the blood I'll pass over you amen go
[1:13:01] back and get your toys and just start
[1:13:03] Play Israel was
[1:13:07] relaxed hello Israel was
[1:13:13] relaxed what some of y'all look at me
[1:13:15] like a mule looking at a new gate
[1:13:18] relaxed you must not be what I'm dealing
[1:13:20] with no and you're not dealing with what
[1:13:23] I'm dealing with so there yes but we can
[1:13:26] be
[1:13:28] relaxed not relaxed in a sense that we
[1:13:30] put our armor down and we don't fight no
[1:13:33] we can rest in his promises that's we
[1:13:35] can rest in the assurance that The God
[1:13:38] Who made the way through through the
[1:13:40] through the to the promised land is the
[1:13:42] same one that's going to take a group
[1:13:44] into this Promised
[1:13:46] Land he's the same God Amen so death can
[1:13:50] come to your door as long as God's
[1:13:52] requirement the blood's been placed on
[1:13:53] the lentil h post of your heart what
[1:13:56] difference does it make can't bother me
[1:13:58] if the doctor says you're going to die
[1:13:59] tomorrow what difference does it make
[1:14:01] the blood is on the post you got to die
[1:14:03] sometimes anyhow but if that blood's
[1:14:05] been applied I have a Resurrection
[1:14:08] coming amen that's right Israel could be
[1:14:11] calm they didn't have to build up a lot
[1:14:12] of steam for they know that the death
[1:14:14] angel could not strike them behind the
[1:14:20] blood all that is in Jesus is safe

[1:21:10] I no your Refuge needs to be
[1:21:12] God that's where your Refuge has to be
[1:21:16] my refuge is my job no your Refuge needs
[1:21:19] to be God your Refuge needs to be a
[1:21:22] place that has never failed
[1:21:25] right because we're going through
[1:21:27] unprecedented
[1:21:31] times
[1:21:36] yeah I don't look for the storm storm
[1:21:38] winds to get
[1:21:43] less well I'm so glad we made it through
[1:21:46] 2020 so glad we made it through 20 and
[1:21:48] it just gets worse and it gets worse and
[1:21:50] it gets worse and the world gets worse
[1:21:52] that's what the world's going towards
[1:21:54] worse and worse and worse is not going
[1:21:58] to get better
[1:22:00] right if it goes 100 years it's not
[1:22:03] going to get
[1:22:06] better it's going to get
[1:22:09] worse so there's only one
[1:22:12] place of
[1:22:16] safety There's No Escape there's no
[1:22:19] getting away from
[1:22:23] it there's there's only one
[1:22:26] escape and that's Jesus Christ there's
[1:22:29] only one place of safety and that's
[1:22:32] Jesus
[1:22:35] Christ it'll
[1:22:39] hold it's held through every time in the
[1:22:42] Scriptures it held held held held held
[1:22:47] all the way through and it's getting
[1:22:49] worse but it's still holding it's
[1:22:52] getting worse but it's still holding is
[1:22:54] going to hold it will not fail that's
[1:22:59] right brother BR was talking about being
[1:23:01] up in Kentucky and I this is one of my
[1:23:03] favorite stories that he tells as far as
[1:23:05] the Prelude to this you understand a
[1:23:08] minute one time up in
[1:23:10] Kentucky in a Mountain Country I came
[1:23:13] from I was preaching early in the
[1:23:15] afternoon he said I was preaching on
[1:23:17] Hellfire and
[1:23:19] brimstone for the unbeliever there was
[1:23:22] those old loggers sitting back there and
[1:23:24] I said all you drunkard and he was one
[1:23:26] you better repent get right with God
[1:23:29] there been a fell come to the night in
[1:23:30] the night before that was cutting corn
[1:23:32] he had a big nail sticking his overalls
[1:23:34] he said well I I'm going to go up there
[1:23:37] we'll throw that little preacher out the
[1:23:38] window so he came to the door and
[1:23:41] someone told him that's the roughest
[1:23:42] Bunch someone told me he said that's the
[1:23:43] roughest Bunch that's around here
[1:23:45] standing there great big barly looking
[1:23:47] Fell's arms crossed beard hanging down
[1:23:49] on his face about 30 years old he was a
[1:23:51] mean looking man he kept looking at me
[1:23:53] and I just kept looking at him preaching
[1:23:55] repent or
[1:23:58] perish and he said I guess he stayed a
[1:24:00] little too
[1:24:01] long the Holy Spirit got a hold of him
[1:24:04] he fell on the floor he couldn't get to
[1:24:06] the altar quick enough he came up with
[1:24:08] his hands over his head crying God be
[1:24:10] merciful to me the next night his little
[1:24:13] daughter came down little girl handed me
[1:24:15] a bunch of flowers came when I came to
[1:24:16] the door she said brother Bill I have a
[1:24:19] new daddy at home I want to show you
[1:24:21] that I love you for coming here and
[1:24:23] preaching the gospel and letting Jesus
[1:24:25] make me a new
[1:24:27] daddy Hallelujah he said but this old
[1:24:29] drunk sitting there and I said all you
[1:24:31] drunkers all you Sinners repent and he
[1:24:33] got angry and out the door he went and
[1:24:36] he went home and he went to
[1:24:40] bed I was staying down at my
[1:24:42] grandfather's house and said while he
[1:24:44] was having the meeting going across
[1:24:46] those Hills with a lantern in your hand
[1:24:48] so then long midnight just saw the same
[1:24:50] old fell come down he started beating on
[1:24:52] the door and open he said brother brand
[1:24:54] I want you to pray for me I had the
[1:24:56] awfulest dream a while ago I just can't
[1:24:58] stand it through the night I what's the
[1:25:00] matter I he said I dreamed I was a
[1:25:03] rabbit and I was sitting out in the
[1:25:05] field just eating Clover having a good
[1:25:07] time and doing as I pleased and I said
[1:25:09] after a while I heard a ball of a hound
[1:25:12] and the Hound was right on me and I took
[1:25:14] out the run but the Hound was faster
[1:25:16] than I was and it said I happened to
[1:25:19] turn and look and there was a big rock
[1:25:20] and I heard about I heard about in that
[1:25:22] rock was a hole and I knew if I could
[1:25:24] only beat that Hound to the hole I'd be
[1:25:27] safe but if I couldn't beat it he'd have
[1:25:29] me and brother brand I was running for
[1:25:31] all that I had know at any minute I'd be
[1:25:33] gobbled up because I could feel the hot
[1:25:35] breath of the Hound as he jumped on my
[1:25:37] heels and all at once he made a grab and
[1:25:40] I slipped in the hole and when I got in
[1:25:42] there I could relax there I said that's
[1:25:46] right that is God you dreamed about he's
[1:25:48] a rock in a weary land he's a cliff in
[1:25:51] the rock for Sinners just run into it
[1:25:54] and be saved Christ is our
[1:25:57] Rock he said they'll run after
[1:25:59] everything but Christ but if you run
[1:26:01] after him amen you will find peace and
[1:26:05] safety Hallelujah Psalms 46 and verse
