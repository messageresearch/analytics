TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello everyone we're happy that you joined with us today we are the ministry team that even in like tabernacle and we come together again to discuss the Word of God today we're going to be talking about how the New Testament church was born and how that had changed from the law to grace and the it was a changing of dispensation that was taken place in we would find in the book of Acts that there was a question among the believers at that time whether or not to continue with outward circumcision that we talked about in one of our sessions and because there was some Judaizers that were saying unless you're circumcised according to the law of Moses you cannot be saved and so this to them was still the sign of the covenant which there was a fulfillment of this sign by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so in Acts chapter 15 14 simeon had declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name so god was doing something very specific here wasn't he very very different and that's maybe something important too to say is that god does not deal with the jews and the gentiles in the same way God deals with Israel as a nation and the Gentiles as a people as a people for his namesake now there is the transition that we see in the dispensational change from the Jews to the Gentiles but the majority of Israel was blinded and then God moved to the Gentile people for his namesake does this mean that a Jew today cannot be saved or cannot come to Christ not at all the Paul spoke of it in the in the Bible that he said that for the elects sake they were saved but the rest were blinded and so when when Christ founded the church it's composed of both Jew and Gentile hmm and the beginning church was primarily Jews at that time there was Peter there was Paul there was you know James and many of them but for the most part Jesus came to his own his own received him not and he said lo returned to the Gentiles multi-well so this would be the wisdom or the revelation that Paul would speak about a for example he said we speak the wisdom among them which are perfect or mature yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought but we speak the wisdom of God in the mystery even though his hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory and then he goes on to say God was revealing some great things that I had not seen and he isn't not heard what God was going to do and so this would be further explained by Paul in Ephesians chapter 3 how that by revelation he was made known to him was made known the mystery and the mystery was that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel amen so this was actually a new revelation well he's going from one nation and one people and one locality to all the world all nations whosoever will let him come every nation tongue kindred tribe his now all is welcomed through the blood of Jesus very wonderful which makes a holy nation a holy priesthood right a peculiar people right and so God never done away with his separated nation that's right but this is a higher place way we find when you go back to the Old Testament we know that Solomon was commissioned to build got a temple yes sir and it was a glorious temple there was never wouldn't like it but we find that it due to the neglect of God's people the temple was destroyed and inherit came on the scene Herod reconstructed the temple almost identical to Solomon's Temple by trying to make it more grander and glorious but we find that in that that's man's work to do something they were presenting a sacrifice declaring that there was still an arc of the Covenant there was a mercy seat because God gave his people a promise I will meet you between the mercy seat yes and you come and we knew that the high priest can only enter into that holy place once a year and he would present to sacrifice for the people but we find here in mark 15 38 the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom what was he declaring Jesus when he died on the cross he rent that temple veil from top to bottom showing that it wasn't man but it was him and what he did is he put the mercy seat in plain view that the Mercy ceased not behind that veil the mercy seats hanging on a cross so now where it was sin for anybody to come into that holy place they would die the high priest had a pomegranate and a bell on his feet and we would go in he would sing holy holy holy unto the Lord and if it wasn't loud it wasn't making any music they knew he was dead and now we find that if our life isn't crying holy holy holy unto the Lord that we are dead as believers but where the high priest went in once a year and for those that wasn't a high priest to go in it was death now for us not to go in because the mercy seats in plain view no longer is is a high priest presenting our sacrifice Jesus is our sacrifice right he's become that lamb that dispensation has changed no longer we under the law now we're under the grace of God and he's gonna meet us on the mercy seat which is Christ - were in this hour yeah that's right the the incomplete sacrifice sacrifices was finished at that point that you spoke of when he died and cried it is finished it was right there and Daniel spoke of it in in Daniel chapter 9 yeah it says that seventy weeks would be determined upon Daniel's people and upon the holy city which the seventy weeks was representing a designated time for the Jewish people as a nation and then it said in the midst of the week he will cause the sacrifice of oblation to cease exactly and so Christ was fulfilling that as his ministry was three-and-a-half years when he was crucified the the that would be the middle of the the the middle of the week that's correct the sacrifice had ceased now it's really important to understand at the closing of the law and the Jewish dispensation that God deals with the Jews and the Gentiles in two different ways he deals with the Jews as a nation so God is closing now bringing down the curtain on the nation of Israel and the Jewish dispensation as it were and he's moving into another dispensation and at this time when Jesus Christ it is finished mm-hmm he says he Lila box and I why is that a canoe and he gave up the ghost the earth began to quake the veil was rent as you said from top to bottom showing this was God's work salvation is of the Lord right that it was God's working then something amazing took place and it's just a tiny little scripture there in verse Matthew 27 52 let me read 51 and it says behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from top to bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many so there was a resurrection then that took place as as the Old Testament and the Jewish dispensation came to an end that there actually was a resurrection of all the saints of the Old Testament so when we come to the end of the Gentile dispensation there's also to be another resurrection of all the Gentiles from the seven ages and and so you know this is exactly another parallel you know that Jesus actually we've been talking about him fulfilling the law even at the Passover he fulfilled another feast and that was the feast of firstfruits this goes along exactly with what you're talking about and and Paul would say in 1st Corinthians 15:20 but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept wonderful so he was he also was a first fruit Jesus Christ fulfilling the feast of firstfruits you know you'd have the Passover the the unleavened bread the feast unleavened bread and the feast of firstfruits all happened right there bang bang bang right in a row and then 50 days later would come and Pentecost and so again Jesus when it was not only unleavened and the unleavened bread and sinless bread from heaven but now he's also the firstfruits of them that slept so he's the first one up from the dead of the Old Testament and with him with comes all of the saints there is a revelation that runs down through the Old Testament and it's typology it was it was the Holy Spirit showing that there was going to be a resurrection and if you remember Abraham bought a field yeah to to bury Sarah and he himself was buried there then you find Jacob was buried there Isaac it was buried there and many of those prophets longed to be buried in the Promised Land yeah what Joseph tell him don't you leave my bones here that's exactly why don't you leave my bone here he prophesied you will carry my bones out of Egypt yeah yeah so while those 400 years they were being whipped and being abused by the Egyptians they would look at that lead coffin and they'll say one day yeah we're coming out of this bondage one day God made a promise right and what a what a comfort that must have been but we have a better comfort yeah because we can look over to Palestine and see there's an empty grave that fans is finding that one day we're coming up and so down through the ages you'll find that prophets looked and wanted to be buried in that land you'll see that Ruth said your people will be my people your God will be my God where you're buried I'll be buried in man and you'll see job he talked about you know though I the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall see God right they were all looking forward to that resurrection and that resurrection was was coming so they all fell down under the blood of bulls and goats and that's a very good point because before the atonement they did not go under the altar in heaven as it were they went to a different place called paradise in the belly of the earth because the atonement was not there they did not go up they went down mm-hmm right that's right so this brings us to something that really happened then during the time of Jesus death barrelled resurrection before he raised from the grave and the Old Testament Saints the Bible tells us that he had a ministry while he was in the Tuesday yeah and so he said in first Peter 3:18 for Christ hath once suffered for us force in the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the spirit are quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometimes were disobedient when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water so you know Jesus actually was alive he was he was ministering he went down into the the bowels of the earth yes and he would actually empty paradise yes amen so he was not a dead lifeless form you know the grave whose spirit was non-existent our soul sleeping he was actually alive and these souls were there yes and though their bodies slept in a grave and with the Saints that slept yet they were very very much alive because he preached to souls that were even in prison even those who didn't repent and said I am the fulfillment of what Noah preached amen amen I've heard you say it before it's always excited to me you know Jesus told the thief on the cross he said this day you'll be with me wandering in Paris so we know Jesus was going there but we also know that the thief went there and you've mentioned it in a sermon before and I think about how exciting it must have been when the thief came running through that door and he let him know he's right behind me ready he's coming get him everything you've been waiting for it's it's right you're honest you know what a witness that must have been him coming in letting them know you're only going to be here another moment and even the rich man who was in hell lifted up his eyes and he saw Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham right and there was a great gulf fixed but they were in the belly of the earth and they could not come right and if you remember in the book of Revelation jesus said I have the keys of death and hell so first he paid our price and he descended into hell where we belong but he went down to Satan himself he took his keys gave him a swift kick in the pants yeah he came he preached to the souls in prison up through Paradise he unlocked paradise and at his resurrection those over comers rose with him that we're looking for the coming of the Lord that were justified by their faith in those substitute or substitutionary offerings looking for the coming in the Messiah they rose with him and he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto man a man calls the blood of bulls and goats would not cover sin wouldn't yell covers and so you know it would not annihilate or do away with the sin it was only something that would was it's kind of like paint over over a blemish but if the blemish is still there it's just painted over but the blood of Jesus is a bleach that totally annihilate ever since taint a man and so when Jesus went to paradise he actually there his blood now was a greater blood than bulls and goats and he delivered them from this place price and moved to all of paradise into into heaven and to his entities in one lorry because no man could ascend into heaven except the he that came down from heaven even the Son of Man which is in heaven this is John 3:13 and so the Bible would also say that he led captivity captive so he took them from paradise and they ascended up with him and and of course he said now he that is ascended what is it but he also descended reverse into the lower parts of the earth yes this is Ephesians 4 the night man he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens wonderful so he said he led those that were captive in and held there in question until the Redeemer could come and and take away their and then move paradise into heaven so that when when we die now we do not go to the bowels of the earth racing Lord amen but we are there under the altar of God hey man how wonderful man and so they the Old Testament or the Jewish dispensation closed with a resurrection yes yes and the Gentile dispensation will also close with a resurrection hallelujah praise Allah then not only a resurrection but a rapture exactly yes sir because Jesus ascended and the Saints with him they marry man wonderful you notice one thing to curse for we close this out you said he ends it with the resurrection the Jewish dispensation but it also ended with the rending of the temple veil God showing I'm not in where you think I am but I'm somewhere else yes I think we found it today that he's not you know the Bible says he's seated in the throne of God showing himself to be God but that's where the church sees him but he's somewhere else that's a good point so what happened to those Jews who had not turn the corner yes well that's where tribulation came upon a people and they fell out from the grace of God and and only grace now was gonna be shown by accepting the blood atonement of Jesus Christ and that's why that the Jewish nation has been scattered and dispersed people for all of these years but God has promised I will restore cinnamon-raisin Lord amen this is God he will not forgive man amen amen god bless you today
