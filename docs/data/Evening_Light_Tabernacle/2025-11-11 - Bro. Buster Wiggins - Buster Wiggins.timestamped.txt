[0:04] Just to walk with him means more to me
[0:10] than words
[0:12] could ever tell.
[0:16] To dwell within the presence
[0:22] of a man you will.
[0:26] There could be no greater privilege
[0:32] afforded
[0:34] on demand
[0:37] than to walk through this end time.
[0:43] Hold in God's hand.
[0:50] I know
[0:52] he's my father.
[0:55] I'm so glad
[0:58] that I'm his son.
[1:01] Oh, I was in the mind of God
[1:07] before the world had begun.
[1:13] Yes, I believe
[1:18] every
[1:20] thing I've heard
[1:22] that was said by brother Brown
[1:28] who interpreted
[1:30] God's word
[1:35] and I'll always
[1:38] love to serve him.
[1:41] No matter
[1:43] where I go,
[1:46] I know that he'll be with me
[1:51] cuz his word tells me so.
[1:56] I know he won't forsake me.
[2:02] He'll keep me by his side
[2:07] cuz I'm one of the chosen
[2:12] of his elected bride.
[2:19] And I know that he's my father.
[2:25] I'm so glad
[2:27] to be his son.
[2:31] I was in the mind of God
[2:36] for the world had begun.
[2:41] I know that I believe
[2:46] every single word
[2:51] that was said by brother Gre
[2:56] who interpreted
[2:58] God's word
[3:03] that was sent by brother Brown
[3:08] who in turn It's in God's word.
