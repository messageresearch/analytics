being born again and washed in the blood and filled with the Holy Ghost hey my redemption is not over the blood skillet own healing is filled of fits into every one of us hey man whatever need that we have we can receive it today we're going to have a baptism of service for Joshua and Chester done a man were there bearing their old life and rides of the new in Christ a man he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved this is the word of God and the promise of the Lord baptism does now save us not putting outside are a way to filter the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God a man my we have just enjoyed the word of songs today that has went for it and these brothers from Dallas we appreciate your ministry to us today you have blessed my heart I think about the labors that have went forth in the nations of Africa and went forth to to try to reach believers over there we win ourselves in five or six different countries seem to works and things that have been done and today still in contact with many of the believers and brothers there and it just goes to show us God's got him something way beyond the house for no more but he wanted a bride from every nation kindred tongue and people and today we have gathered here in this presence we're here today to speak to him children of his have gathered for a wedding and man we see some of these sisters here that has come from up in Arkansas way but the Jake sister Jimmy Brown here also my brother Armstrong back there and when Father's Day my you know all kinds of things gathers here today but we're here to worship God and that's why we're here in this building today we're here to give our best to the Lord and surrender our lives to him and just say God speak in a mighty way a man who knows but the ones that we baptize today may be the last ones hey man you say well wait a little longer please sees us I'll tell you I'm I'm starting to pray like John Deere even so come Lord Jesus a man even so come when we see the world collapsing around us and we realized we hadn't got much little time left I'm sayin Lord let us find that last one soon Amen we built this building we made extra room for prophetess to come home Josh done is a prodigal and he's come home amen some times ago I I preached a sermon on and actually after he stood again up in in that up in Washington State hmm the prodigal son when he came to himself we've seen the Holy Spirit just deal with hearts and lives time after time I believe we should have on on our hearts today Lord deal with those hearts deal with those children deal with those wayward ones that are out there a man I think as I looked you know and I ever one of us noticed it yesterday and of course I took me back all the way to 1981 when I was in Anniston Alabama I went there too after brother George liquors had passed away and I was interned pastor and they're just helping out get ministry in driving 500 miles over there one way to minister and come back try to do that once a month or so Goethe knows I had those times ministering to those Saints there the Lord changed my subject that mornin and I three stones from Chrysler revealed in his own word a little something brother Branham said about stabilizers being put on the ship there was a young man that was there came in with his family jung yong li newly married newlywed hair down his shoulders just like a hippie its shirt wouldn't cover his belly sat down there in the service there and as I come out I begin to preach and I saw the word go and start directing toward this young man and that was Vernon Winters and there he began to cry out and scream out to God for mercy his wife had never seen all the skirt move on anybody she just grabbed him and started petting him and trying to console him but that day he come to the Lord his life was changed as marijuana went out the window on the way another burner has been through some ups and downs and some subside tracks and backsliding but I believe that even today that God has dealt with his heart and brought him back to him he's been back in service with us but now cancer has him down we just need to remember him in prayer we saw his son up here Matthew had a lot of hope for him that God would pull him out because that's what I told mother burning when he straight away I said look around it your family looking around your children they're gonna go the wrong direction oh no no he said I why you don't have to be in the message to to raise good kids I said it won't happen the only way that'll ever be is for you to raise them into the into righteousness and into truth it's children one by one and straight away and pull on the world has been I've on RT we've seen it on Matt winters we saw him yesterday well so no wait you're wrong Kaali the same way those things touch our hearts but I believe on this Father's Day I believe the Holy Spirit can send His angels and tap on their shoulders wake up up in the middle of the night or wherever there are kind of Li save them and bring delivers a man that they can make a full surrender it's Almighty God and I'm just asking you today amen let us let us look up on there as I look just today and I said Oh God hungry hearts thirsty souls that are destined for God but are trying to satisfy on other things may all god they're coming awakening in their heart and returned back Lord I pray in the name of Jesus will you pray with me that you'll reach out to every protocol to every soul that is wandering from you look me we not look upon the any of them with within with some to some spirit of our dislike or whatever are distasteful but something looking down on them but Lord made me see a hungry soul may we see a seed that has predestinated nor can you reach that heart that you'll reach that soul that you'll turn those lives around and bring them to you and I pray O God in this message this morning that you'll deal with hearts and lives of your children everywhere for the burden that these listen to me and Lord if he's able to tune in the day where you touch his heart to me will you speak to him in a great way and let it know Lord it know God that he can look at the gospel is a positive gospel Lorca he can identify himself with the saints of God not as a cane or a Judas no son or daughter of God in all reality we've all been betrayals and denials but Lord did she reach and mercy that gave us grace turned our lives around and I pray he'll turn two lives around the many Lord dinner upon the hearts of your children today fathers that are reaching out for their sons and daughters may that you bring salvation may salvation come to their house today in the name of Jesus for our brother Daryl Baxter who's as sick with them with a kidney stone in great pain I pray you bring deliverance in the main name of Jesus send the word for today to bring healing to him in Jesus name made this be an hour deliverance and that mountain be moved and crushed into tiny grains of sand and passed in Jesus name Amen and amen thank you lord amen let's sing that song I've got peace like a river peace like a river amen how many's got that peace this morning a man that's exactly what the hunger in the heart a brother and sister done the two men at my office we've spoke to him a couple of times it won't that peace in their heart there was that joy in their heart and with that love hey man that only the love of God can bring amens let's worship the Lord as we sing this today we'll have got peace like a river I've got peace like a river I've got peace like a river [Music] I've got I got much my god like they don't [Music] I've got I've got I got [Music] [Music] yeah hey man turn with me to first Corinthians chapter 10 and as you're looking there in the scripture this morning and finding that in the in the Bible in 1st Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 Amen we want to also just looking around and seeing the different ones seeing the Oklahoma folks up there the green family different ones they're also Mandy's dad and God bless you for being with us today we just are glad to be with the children of God and you meant see the Myles family back again and they met James and Joyce now you can show up again are they here I haven't seen them well the doors are still open for the James mr. Joyce he mind the Boogerman ain't got none of us yet so you might as well come on back to church any men we love you in the Lord amen Boogerman I'm talking about that Co good 19 I'm praying who stays away I don't want to go back to streaming any man I love it when you're here a man I'm giving you a warning you pray it away or I'm gonna take a vacation hey man first Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 moreover brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea if you can just stop and go back in your mind just for a moment and you can't go most of you but try to vision it this is my text that I took fifty years ago my first sermon ever preached came from this this passage of Scripture right here that I read that I'm reading and we're all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea in all did eat the same spiritual meat and all did drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these were our examples to the intent we should not lust after their evil things as they also lusted need to be idolaters as some of them as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play and neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all of these things happen unto them for examples and they were written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall amen gonna let you have your seats but I'd like you to find also another scripture reading in Exodus chapter 17 and we'll read from the first verse a man Exodus chapter 17 and verse 1 amen and all the congregation of the children of Israel gathered are journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the Lord and pitched in rep Adem and there was no water for the people to drink wherefore the people did chide with Moses and said give us water that we may drink and Moses said unto them why try to eat with me wherefore you do you tip the Lord and the people there stood there for water and the people murmured against Moses and said wherefore is it that thou has brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children in our cattle with thirst and Moses cried unto the Lord saying what shall I do unto this people they be almost ready to stun me and the Lord said unto Moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of Israel and thy rod we're without smothers the river taking that hand and go behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel and he called the name of the place masa and Meribah because of the chiding of the children of Israel and because a chimp to the Lord saying is the Lord among us or not I want to speak today and use for a text of a people on speaking terms I believe that we too are in an exodus it is the 3rd Exodus and of course since you know the first Exodus is Moses leading the children of Israel back to their land of promise and the second Exodus of course is Christ leading a church out of the wall into the Promised Land of Grace and the 3rd Exodus is where God has taken those people who have come into grace into a rapture and and then this Exodus we have had a prophet to call us out of the world and to come into Christ the word now Israel has always been a historical example of the church as you can see Paul would use it in his day an hour and he would point out of Israel and their failings and there were and and their even their victories and he would say now these things happened unto them for examples for they are written for our admonition in other words for us to take warning upon whom the ends of the world has come and I believe that we are now have arrived now seven churches later a man upon those of whom the ends of the world are come and then he gives us warn and let him that thinketh he standeth to take heed lest he fall and of course we can look and see that the Word of God is very inspired and this was written some two to three thousand years ago twenty-eight hundred years ago maybe and and the end how that God laid it out there for an example and made a shadow of something to testify of the positive is always important when you read your Bible that you see yourself in it because it was prop the sign of our day and we believe that there is no reason to write any history today because we believe we are the last generation and so being the last generation that we believe that we're we we will not write history for others to read but we are fulfilling all of the scriptures that have been spoken of this hour as I believe all the Word of God has been pointing to this day in this time in this hour in which we're living now first when we look back at this we must remember why that the children of Israel were down in Egypt to begin with after all God had promised their all the way in the beginning that with Abraham Isaac and Jacob he'd promised him the land of Palestine and he gave them that land and said this is yours walk over it and claim every sin every bit of it and and of course you know then why would not the people not be in the place that God provided and that's the question today for all of us to realize that God that gave us a Pentecost and he gave us the book of Acts by the way just that you might know I am quoting this part from the third Exodus he said that's a question of today also God gave us a Pentecost he gave us the book of Acts he gave us the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide us he gave us a land and why are we out of it and why is the church Attaway isn't a great Christian Church today living again like the book of Acts and bringing forth the same thing and there's some reason for it and of course we know the reason that they were out was because they because of the jealousy of a brother that the Brothers of Joseph were jealous because of Joseph's gift and the favor of a father he remember his jealousy you name you picked up on that in your prayer this morning brother Johnny but it is jealousy that is why that Cain killed Abel you see Cain that is on Alfred and it was not accepted and and so you know that that made a rise of jealousy in him that he killed his brother over worship a man over church over religion over God accepting one and not accepting the other and yet if that wasn't all forgiven to him to be accepted people a lot of times they all came never had a chance yes he did he said if you just come the way that a foe came you see what I bless you see I required the blood you see I require dying lamb you see the sin that come in the garden if you'll just come that way amen I will accept you but because of jealousy he rises up and he he strikes his brother down now jealousy then is at the root of every denomination and every set and denominational move that's in the message that at the root of it is jealousy a mad man now in fact of the matter is in many cases that's exactly the problem with many of the split churches and split homes the split everywhere division that is aerial because of jealousy and jealousy is pride in sustainment and pride and suspicion and distrust and doubt and apprehension about rivals progressiveness or possessiveness rather and overprotectiveness even brother madam dollars from the church age book he said the reason that they make their manuals and kept down and put a period to the Word of God is cuz they see that and move and then they said we must write it in our manuals and then we we must establish this so that the fire will not go out and he said it causes the fire go out because they don't allow God to keep moving on in their lives I want you to know wherever you are today you better not put a period to it you better be looking for God to move in a greater way in your life and mine cause we're in a very serious time it is this jealousy that causes the sex and the the sect s-e-c TS sex that is that is that that is caught em and the sex the divisions among churches and personality cults to arise causing division in the body of Christ now you know I well as I I was not even gonna go this way in fact of the matter is I had a whole sermon that has been that I had and ready to to go and and was just had just putting the finishing pieces together and the Lord just directed my thoughts and I had to turn and go this direction this morning and as I was coming awake as I was coming awake I I saw a group of people and I heard these words the house of Chloe and so I am NOT not even at that moment and to weld on my brain not even remembered where that was in the Bible I went quickly and looked it up and I just like to go with me you to go with me to purchase Corinthians 1 and 10 as I looked around at these these people and then they look like godly sisters men and and then I heard the words the house of Chloe and I just want to read you as I have read about these personality cults that calls division in 1st Corinthians 1 and 10 now I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing I wonder if we can ever come back to this in the message that we would all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you and that should be perfectly joined together in the same mind in the same gentlemen I wonder what it would be even if evening like Tabernacle would come to this place that we all speak the same thing that took me no divisions among young perfectly joined together and with no funny feelings among us a man but before he said it had been declared unto me of my brethren of them which are the house of Chloe that there are contentions among you and he said now I say this I say that every one of you saith I'm appalled and high of Apollo's and I of Cephas at Peter and I of Christ he says is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul you see there again that goes to show is that there's no salvation in any denomination even any personality cult come on and then there's no salvation in here in any of these sects of movement because they were not crucified for us reminder water was crucified for us was Christ and man is he that we owe our allegiance to it's he we must come in LA booyah hey man I don't even I'm not even interested in you becoming in love with a prophet or love with this ministry but lovable it may help me as a pastor I want you to get in love with Jesus then he becomes the first thing in your life the main thing in that you forget every other team and the things of the world go strangely dim as you look upon him see him God worked with Joseph calls his brethren to hate him and just remember we have had a whole generation today that was indicted and it did not just indict - the denominational it denied nighted even many of the independents remember we got a church world under indictment for crucifying that means taking the effect of the world away from the people he said cuz you can't crucify Christ the second time and neither can you go and mail this to across but he said the way we crucified Christ and this day is we kill the effect of the word that the word don't have the same effect to Sheol to deliver to say does that breathe to produce joy of peace in the church and brother madam would tell us today he has another Calvary now and it says the only place let me just settle down for a minute the only place that he meets with ma'am today is under the shed blood I'm sharing this from the indictment this shed blood of the sacrifice I don't care if you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian if you can forget your differences and every Roman Catholic whatever you might be and will come under this shed blood God will meet both of us there that's where we can all meet and fellowship on the same grounds but otherwise he will not meet just because you're a Methodist he will not meet just because you're a Pentecostal he'll meet you under one condition and that's under the shed blood when your sins have been confessed and expelled in his presence then by the blood and the blood is always before him and therefore he can only see you through this shed blood and you're white as snow see when you can you confess your sin otherwise you're not there you can't fellowship and that's the reason you don't see things happening in the churches they confess to believe in the blood but to reject the very plan to get to the blood the word see there's only one way God will honor that word you'll never honor that word and come say I'm Roman Catholic I demand this to be done or I can't you can't do it Methodist Baptist Pentecostals you can't do it the only way you can do it is come under the the mercies of God through His grace has come through the shed blood of Jesus Christ and say Lord I claim the promise and then if you're really under that blood God is obligated to that word but first you must be under that blood and man you see it now no matter no wonder they can't believe in miracles no wonder they can't believe in the supernatural no wonder they condemn it the same reason they condemned it back there is the same reason they condemn it today and they're just guilty that's guilty can be caused only under the shed blood and those who would dare some little brother who dares under humility to take God at His Word and walk out there and confess his sins and forget all these dogmas and date and stand there under the blood and believe it they want to class him a fanatic they want to class him as it was save not a good word that he uses the booklet but so you understand he's an oddball so then he says they have crucified the effects of the world and Manny said how do they crucify the word with Jesus Christ said he's the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 they say in such a way he is and Jesus said his last commandment to the church go into all the world mark 16 go into all the world and preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe all the world every creature and it ain't happy jet and there's millions die every year that's never even heard the name of Jesus still it's the gentle order it's still the commandment of God all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in baptized shall be saved he that believeth not should be damn and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they will cast out Devils they will speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things you shall not harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and they say that was for that generation and they make the commandment of God of none effect to this and they crucify the effect of the word to the people Peter said on the day of Pentecost were the keys of the kingdom that Jesus had just given him whatever you say I'll say it there and on the day of Pentecost he said they asked what they might do to receive the holy girl the Holy Spirit and they were so enjoying it watching others watching others acting what they would call silly and stagger and jump and fall and acting like they were drunk and they were saying these men are full of new hands but there was a man who stood up by the name of Peter who had the keys of the kingdom and said these are not drunken acts - as you suppose seeing that this is the third other day but this is that which was spoken on sea right back to the world again showing that the Spirit is still word and the word is still spirit hallelujah a mountain the Word of God and it shall come to pass as John has spoken by Joel 2:38 and it's a come to pass in the last days saith god I'll pour out my spirit upon the whole flesh listen that brother's said and they will look at him fearless standing there on that but scan given them and died in him and say this in some scripture this is that which was spoken by the Prophet I'll pour up my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy on my hands made and my certain my maidservant I'll pour out my spirit and my oxen glad is not just for brothers but it's for sisters - come on I saw signs in the heavens of bother on the earth and pillars of smoke and vapor proven by the word and it was the word and they laugh and made fun of it and they went to judgment and the city burned and they ate one another's children and to danger scattered people throughout all the world showing the Holy Spirit still remains the Word of God to bring this word to make it live think about it the judgment by looking upon the actions of the Holy Spirit and making fun of it Oh denying it it's Sydenham a whole nation to judgment and so will it be a dis generation hey man well now the second crucifixion he says if a man accepts Father Son and Holy Spirit a Creed instead of the word titles instead of the name what does he do to the people he crucifies the effect of the word to the people when he says that much of sixteen was just for that generation and God said himself there Jesus talking him good to all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not to me now and these signs shall follow them how far every nation every Creed every tongue every race every people the same gospel and when a man tries to cut that out the Bible he crucifies the effects of the gospel to that congregation listen to himself so he says so indict you in the name of Jesus Christ you are guilty of murdering the Lord you see what happens when we did not divine healing when we did not prayer lines when we deny altar calls when we deny the movement of the Spirit you come under and then a judgment that attracts me comes past you might call yourself bride you might quote quote you might read Bibles you might pray prayers but I'll tell you you're no different than the Laodiceans hey ma'am you see brother madam told us in the third Exodus he said they thought these brothers they thought they would never have a use for a man like Joseph so why not just get rid of it they thought you know they actually thought of murdering him but you know money means a lot and they saw a chance to make a dollar and you see the same thing has happened today because our churches have become intellectual that we got the best-dressed clouds the biggest organization the smartest ministers and we have no use for the Holy Spirit in the way it was back there he said then they are full in other words action speaks louder than words so he's saying even if you're not saying that with your lips your actions are showing it okay ma'am that their seminaries and the brain of their being and they're coming together and they're discussing the thing are more able with their own intellectual minds to Senate Church in order better than what the Holy Spirit could do it and so they don't need it any more or any longer it's something we don't need today it's the days of his past now ain't that just right we don't need the Holy Spirit to heal the sick we got doctors we don't need to all the spiritual speak with tongues are all intelligent people and when you do you take right from your framework then I fly a man jesus said to them Jews in his day have you read that the stone that was rejected is the chief Cornerstone that the building said a bomb now why is that kind of preaching foreign to us today why is it why is it I don't want to just bring this down for a moment and you bear with me and sometimes you you said knows him what why why would you do these things and why do you preach the way you're doing it how come you've been laying some things out like this well I'll tell you why I won't just church to become a church that God can send a lost soul to and that we offer them more than an intellectual conception but we introduce them to the power of God that it change her life to a real baptism of the Holy Ghost music Ballentine why are you preaching about healing because I won't God to be able to send somebody who is sick one of his sick children her mommy can come to a place where they believe God and that believers word but they expect the miraculous instead of planning their funeral or just committing them to God and say poor little thing here I'm so sorry you're so sick there ought to be a power in the church a people who knows that God who knows who knows exactly how they cast out Devils in his name and ever sicknesses a devil instead of just saying Pat them on the back and said well you know we know it's God's will for you to be sick and God gets glory out of your sickness and you know you're developing character and we do we develop character when in any trial we go through and God's gonna get glory out of our lives no matter what we get that but friends that should not be an excuse for not happening healing and deliverance in our midst I know people are looking at well God's getting a lot of glory out of that man dying you know and nothing nothing not to not denying the Lord and he he died and God got a lot of glory out of it well God can get a lot of glory out of him being healed being a testimony of Jesus Christ hey Mountain and if God does happen no no this is Father's Day now I've been preaching for over 50 years now so I am a father I look at where this congregation I'm a father to many of you I am the father we don't call a minister father but you know Paul Paul said to Timothy you're my son and you have but one father and he's speaking of himself in relationship to that son now you're with me a man and there's a father sometimes as a father sometimes you have to speak out some things as you see as you see the world coming into the church and things begin to change and we begin to modernize and get pulled this way and that way and we lose our vision and our focus sometimes the Koya takes a father to be able to call it out amen and soon God that does happen to you to sit we don't want you testifying of it why people who testify of it are just wanting glory for themselves and after all don't you know the folks vine and tears have a 19-2 what's that got to do with anything hey my god never sent the true anointing for the tear he sent there 19 for the week and if you can admit the tear has anointing that you all really be able to admit that's a pride of the we has the anointing that sees you how I take a look for that stay but don't get witness or anything that God's doing we sure wouldn't want someone knowing that gods among us sons 105 verse 1 o give thanks unto the Lord and call upon his name and make known his deeds among the people let me read that again sons 105 1 ok thanks under the lord call upon his name and make known his deeds among the people we got a responsibility and meant to make known his deeds among the people you know FF Bosworth which was you know a great mentor and help in brother branham's time in his early ministry went with him to South Africa and so on had a healing campaign before even brother Branham was on the scene back in the 30s and then brother Branham came in the late 40s and and he said but anyway Bosworth said some oppose and write articles against us for publishing the testimonies of those who are miraculously healed what is the matter is there anything wrong and obeying the Lord's command to make known his deeds among the people since Jesus died to open the way for His mercies to reach all the needs of man we surely ought to be willing for them to know it one would think to read some of the books and articles that are being written that it's a crime to let people know about the Lord's compassion by there's willingness to heal and let me let me just go back and by as I can go back back to the 60s on and the actor brother right him leaving the climate and the message you know that and even to now that we are not to testify of God's healing power he was thought he would take away from the profit and it's in his position but I think it's a huge discredit to the man of God to the prophet of God and meant to brother Branham for us to present his message that's one that no longer works Amen because valid testimonies are no longer permitted or wanted the church world even my brother Bosworth's day that predated brother Branham they did not want God's deeds to be published among the people and there's a spirit in this last day the same thing they don't want to hear about it now I'm fully aware that there was some elements of the Pentecostal movement and and some elements of the divine healing movement that abused and misused this oh yeah you know they be turned into a bunch of brackets and how big at it and how many people and how many people pray for it how many people healed and I did this and I did that but I'm just gonna say this I am NOT gonna let a complex that it's caused by their behavior to push me on the other side where I failed to testify of the works of God I've never declared his deeds among the people [Applause] brother branham said in third Exodus he said they thought they would never meet it we don't need speakers with tongues we don't need interpreters of tongues we need no longer no longer need the Old Testament prophets to set us an order by the Holy Spirit we understand it brother Jill come today in this serie suit got a cute little hat to go with it go get hey man bra bra tit there and he's not gonna disrespect the same so worried but I'm um I'm gonna just have him put it on for a minute my my mind what a joy to certain my Savior today a man we no longer need Old Testament prophets to set us an order by the Holy Spirit we understand it stand up mother Jill but your hat on him walk forward I looked at him today announced today that reminds me of brother Brennan he said yeah my little girl Rebecca said yeah might look like brother branham bet you sure ain't no prophet you can have your seat but the truth of it is he is a prophet every New Testament preacher is a prophet I'm I'm the one that the word comes through in the gilliam of the anointing and they say things have never even thought about but today we don't need an honored man in the pulpit we don't need them that sounded streamin men rejoice in the truth and get under and the noise even speak the word and it is proud to I'm like some box from an angle we don't want that anymore we want dignified preachers they've adopted a man-made system to take the place of the Holy Spirit therefore there is a people that's elected the hazard names of the book of life and they can identify there they tapped out for that their spiritual minded therefore they can't doubt for that hallelujah that oughta be asked this morning I can't go for that oh man I can't tolerate that I want to see the holy ghost know that our lives and speaking a hard commitment bailet refuse people who love the dynamic Baptists mechanics alone hallelujah we're to be a called out church who separated church now we're to be thought of as peculiar and eyeballs and different we've been called every kind of names all the way from the beginning after the we were tagged with the name Christians to start with yeah that was not a name that was a nice name they were try it was a slur that's right today it's oh my everybody's a Christian you know why even scallywag presidents are born again hello that's their claim but then way we you know Israel was the people of God until they were called out then they were the Church of God and you're not the Church of God you're not the Bride of Christ until you're called out of the world and you've got to understand you cannot remain in the world and be the church you might be identifying yourself as it turns me you're not the church until you are separated from the world touch means called out and so God was calling them out out of Egypt to be the church and God is calling a bride of people out of the world to be the church all we don't want me the church today we're the bride well the bride is the church the churches a bride and he's gonna have a church without spot or wrinkle and I'm doing this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against her so I guess we are a church where the called out Israel was called out by God separated to God a peculiar people now listen listen you know new converts you'll never go anywhere for in the world in Christ until you separate yourself from your associates in the world let it off anything that would have any influence of sin cut it off that's right hey man you're gonna follow Jesus and man you cannot you cannot you cannot stay with your worldly associates your worldly friends your world of girlfriends or boyfriends or whoever they are you cannot be unequally yoked together and then the end in the Church of God we cannot be yoke ourselves together with unbelievers and I'm even gonna warn you there and spells family you can and in church family here today but don't make your friends people of the world it identifies the bird of the feather that you belong to hey man you walk with God in to walk with God that you can't cannot walk with another unless you agrees is that right a man should choose your friends from from those that believe separate yourself from the gospel or the gossip I mean of unbelief sometimes that even requires you to do the same things with members of it of a group church sometimes you have to walk along hey man hey man you know I mean many years ago I decided I was gonna preach this message that's what I was gone three times gonna preach what's been revealed in this age and I refused to let family mother daddy brothers anybody nobody who no matter who it was to pull me off of that course hey man I might have to stand alone I might be abandoned I might be left behind with by them but I'm not going their way now of course we're we're not called to worship the gods a world that's fornication the Bible said that with Israel when they left Egypt a mixed multitude went with them right a mile and so you know at the end this this mixed multitude started eating the same man they like the seals too in the church ages and that began to call herself bride - and we're predestinated we're not gonna miss it and still live in like the world still unchanged hey man people who are sinners even will enjoy seeing somebody healed her somebody delivered God moving among the people or sermon preached an anointing but but again a mixed multitude now you know he said that he said that brethren I want you to be aware I would not let you to be ignorant her fathers were under the cloud listen this they were under the cloud that pass through the sea they were baptized of the Moses in the cloud and the sea and they're always the same spiritual meat and they take from that same spirit of drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them which is Christ of course they did it in the natural but with many of these God was not well pleased and so again he told them said don't be idolatrous and some of them were the people sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to play isn't this amazing people who started out with sincerity people who started out with the seal I'm determined to hold out to the end somewhere along the line that lost their vision and their purpose and I just want to say what is our purpose our purpose is to be conformed to the image of Christ to be a bride without spot or wrinkle to be a people that is cauldrons namesake you know we started out with zeal we're gonna leave Egypt the world behind us we're not gonna be slaves no more hey man there's there was all the excitement it's his rapture time is rapture hour it's going on time where we're going where there is no sin no sickness and sorrow no pain no death and we're we're under a pillar fire I've indicated prophet the book is open and the seals have been revealed seven previously unknown thunders have either devices and we tried to tell our Egyptians friends but they were happy with being slaves we started out on the journey we got baptized in Jesus name Amen we shouted and danced throughout the ELCA denominations and their traditions the birds sang different and man everybody was sweet with sanctify themself from the world we quit our drinking and our smoking we stopped going to the pool room and man and man we quit the gaming we threw out the rock and roll' got rid of the country-western music the rap and all the other world music women let their hair grow out and then cut theirs they refused to look like the world but we didn't know about the delay we thought because the word had come we were rapture ready and we didn't know that we would be tried by the very word that we had received and the longer of the delay of reaching the land the more people wish for what they had in Egypt soon we started going back to movies again the television was back in the home movies became a regular part of our diet instead of listening to tapes novels and love story books were being read that pervert the mind tight skirts of slips appeared dresses above the knees boys started dressing like perverts a man instead of a Holy Ghost experienced some took a denominational approach like other moves before us I'm gonna warn you brother madam said this cycle of revival and death has never failed and I'm gonna tell you again it will not fail even in this mood that there will be many who started out in this cycle of revival who will go back down into death because it is never mailed and it won't fail in this last day there will be those who started out who could back down into death again but I'm going to tell you that the Word of God also says that there's somebody going to be alive and remain to the coming of the Lord and they will not hinder those that are asleep and I'm going to tell you chokes we're not just going to be the living and breathing but there's gonna be a people alive they don't fire for God who will not be a little to see that people got their mind made up to hearty well Christ are you with me Church some people that are sold after God and they will break the cycle [Applause] did you hear what I said they will break the cycle they will break the cycle of sin and I believe and death and the creams and the dollars of man and there were people that will walk with Christ in his age but the madness I've wrote in our last week soul and saw the social respectability they replaced the primitive of Mosul ISM of Kemp meeting conversions with a more detailed intellectual process that led a criminally to conversion you know brother it's okay does that just have a little faith a little virtue a little paces you know you grow up a little more you're gonna be all right you've got the Holy Ghost you know you overcome that pornography just keeping it no you're not gonna overcome it I said you won't overcome it and you're gonna you're gonna have to die to it and you're gonna have to be born again and that's the problem today a man we turn churches we have turned churches into help centers our Ewing men treatment centers for sin hey man you know you can't get over sin you're just gonna send a little bit every day and you'll never live in victory you'll never really really overcome this stuff you know it went so it's a treatment center you know you get a little better and you fall back and you come on back to church and we'll help you to get going again whatever listen this gospel this blood is not a it's not something for treatment or sin it is a second chakra be you sad you're doubting your I believe in a Care Act what's the ball take didn't sire Adam out of your life you'll be a new creature in Christ but it isn't long we take a denominational attitude about church you know we once couldn't wait to get to church we were very eager to hear more about God learn about what he's doing but after a while it becomes old hat to us in case you don't know what that means it means something tediously familiar or outdated I wonder today if sermons like flashing red light the sign of his coming god of this evil age Satan Z why I'm against denominations many of those sermons invasion of the United States many of those sermons that brother branham priest we're not sound a little bit outdated that's the way it becomes expectation CSIS from looking and expecting Jesus to appear a mosque and I'm gonna tell you this is the way that every service must be we must come with expectation that we're gonna see Jesus he's gonna be in the songs he's gonna be in the prayers he's gonna be in the preaching he's gonna be in the convention he's gonna be in the sealing of the set that Jesus is gonna be present in ever service hallelujah and brother madam would say my could get this audience with one Accord to see and know exactly that Jesus Christ is alive and here among you all we said you physically or mentally believe it but when it can go beyond the mind do you know I did something will happen when you can realize the only thing is is to see Christ in our presence but like his room it becomes a ritualistic affair well I guess they need to get a lamb and they lose the sincerity of their worship the Bible said here they were commanded you must not present anything with a defect because it will not be accepted on your mouth he said here not to present any animal to the Lord it is blind the injured or maimed or anything with a running sore festering rash or scab you must not put any of those in the offering and all the altars and offered made by fire to the Lord brother brems of our Moloch is 1 in 6 and then but it just talks about a son honors his father and the servant is master but a man but if I am a father where's my honor and if if I'm a master words your fear of me say if the Lord of hosts you preach that despise my name but you ask how that we despise your name by presenting defiled food on my altar you asked how we defines you by saying that the table of Lord is contemptible when you offer blind the animals for sacrifice is it not wrong when you present the lame and the sick ones is it not wrong what do you offer one that offer them to your governor would he be pleased with you or show your favor outs the Lord of hosts and this is the way Israel came you know it didn't have the meaning anymore and God didn't deserve their fast anymore and I want you to know if he's here among us that we want him pleased with our worship with our offerings upon the altar a man we want him to feel welcome among us we want him to be so pleased he just comes down and bathes over the congregation and the Holy Ghost moved back and forth over the building in the people but see even Israel got this place they got to the place where they're so loathe it that like bread angels food bread from heaven see these are testing times and I want to say we are in testing times understand its hour of delay where men say the Lord has delayed is coming and the attitude of the people begin to change how many still connected ha how many just daydreaming nobody's daydreaming how many sleep I'm he's keyed in tuned in said the Lord speak to me today she got the quarrel and fussing with one another on the journey loathe in the light over the bread they wanted to go back to Egypt they lost their enthusiasm oh you know that's something we're not to have in church anymore is enthusiasm ma'am Lettie you know but yes it's brother Brennan said a hazy reason to dad has he raised if he hasn't then just forget it if he has let's get our enthusiasm started let's get filled with his spirit and go to prayin and start a meet and do something that is that's a 63 quote anyway a man he talked about the high priest you got in trouble for this one time brother David James telling about this were you where were you shared with some I think some Pentecostals about those that went and dressed the high priests going behind the holiest of Holies and he dress you know when they had a bell and a pomegranate weren't made a noise as he as he walked into the holiest of Holies and and those who were waiting on him to come out they could they could tell whether or not he was still alive because he was making some noise hey man and brother Maddon said a boy and where there ain't no noise then he might be dead well I think that's a whole lot of matter with our churches today there's not enough noise about it not enough enthusiasm not enough something to wear Jesus ears there's always noise [Applause] hallelujah hi man well you see again if you ain't hearing no noise in your church - got a dead church there are to be some noise of the praises of God trained singing everywhere Jesus is there's a lot of noise he said I don't know why it is but it's a sign there's life there hey man he said he said a lot of these churches have been need to be buried they've been dead a long time ago you don't hear no noise at all it's like a morgue instead of a lively place a place on fire for God and that's a 64 quote you know something he says has to move when he's around and he's referring to them that when they begin to cry out and begin to say you know Hosanna to the son of David and some of got jealous some have got jealous and said stop this noise stop them them children from from shouting and Saint Hosanna to the son of David stop all of this him Jesus said ha if they hold their peace the rocks will cry out amen that's gonna help honey that will worship him that's gonna have somebody that will give him praise that will honor his name this is what he says in spiritual amnesia notice today's crop notice what we do we actually got enough God about us who we come on the blackboard we say well yeah maybe I better come up now thats experience of worldwide yeah maybe I was better good I'd better go up and stand well I don't know Here I am see what a place to be in there is no fire burning there there is no enthusiasm there's not a go into it and as an evangelist that kills me to see God's people in that shape we're supposed to be on fire hey man but he said you know what it is revelation three lukewarm Laodicea a mom again brother Branham said of this she said so he said the bride is a part of the groom you know sue we find out it's the same thing she do exactly what's predicted for her to do this day she won't be allowed to see it but no means that lukewarm but she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving on in the spirits a ma'am he tells us in the Easter seal he said and I think we mustn't lose our enthusiasm he tells us in the message ashamed and he says the revival among the churches has died everybody knows that you'd feel it in this Tabernacle you feel it everywhere it's a thump but that feeling that something isn't right is because the revival enthusiasm has gone away from the people going to churches you see them sitting there al pastor stumbling around for a message or something another first thing you know he's turned out to some kind of party they're gonna have her something it seems to be a dead stuff everywhere brother branham would say an invisible union I'm not looking for revival in our generation I'm looking for the coming of the Lord in our generation so you say brother Jim then what should we expect well we shouldn't expect a worldwide revival a man we shouldn't expect another denominational move a man no we should not expect that we're not looking for that we're looking for the coming of the Lord a man but but he's saying but listen brother Brennan said in the Easter seal listen the listener he said men and women it'll make you stand to your feet it'll make you do things that God wants you to do I don't care what somebody else says about you the neighbor said oh that person's lost their mind pray all night to read the Bible I don't care what this is what God told you to do that's right oh they say we can't have these are old-fashioned Pentecostal revivals oh yes we can - you can have it in yourself and you are the majority and God no matter what the rest of them think [Music] hallelujah the world ain't gonna have one but you can have one hallelujah God's will have a bride who's in love with him who's enthused about him who wants to get him at that Tudor home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride who wants to see the world come to an end and a people go into a rapture but people who are looking for the coming of the Lord and the focuses is Synod on that hallelujah God he said send us for a Bible all of these are from 63 on send us a revival before we perish that's right we need an old-fashioned God sent so Stern revival yes Frank Christ back among us find Christ in the old fashioned altars and meetings that we used to have years ago oh my think about that he said the reason why we don't have it we went off and left Christ that's right that's what it was breached grumblin carnality cut off the water supply think of this people left the muddy waters of Egypt to drink from a spiritual rock and they were complaining people leaving the fleshpots and the garlic in Egypt Teen Angels food and they were still complaining hey man they were leaving the boasting physicians amides of saying the days of miracles are past and no such things as miracles anymore and to go out among people with signs following with the sign of the king and the camp and great wonders and signs and pillow fire hanging over them and the blessings are fallen and Spears of mana out of heaven and they were still grumbly and the prophets words is it was an insult to their maker you see there's got to be a love affair come on a love affair man I might have to bring this down here first in a few minutes there's still some points I want to get to but you see what happened was is they come in the dry places that came into the desert of Horeb Horeb means a dry place a desert and when we get out of fellowship with one another in the church and out of fellowship with the Holy Spirit it brings us to a dry place a desert where everything's got stickers right hey man you know in the desert a little piece of cactus with that sticker on it it's amazing what brother branham can look at the earth cactus and see he would say I see that sticker being a little tinder leaf that because of the desert conditions it all shriveled up and tightened up until it becomes a sticker amen are you with me now a precious tender leaf that had no water wound itself up so tight until it's a sticker a precious so if it had been water right a man if it had been watered right a man would have been a tender little leaf or something but instead it's wound itself up until it's a sticker a man it just needs water it's been punchy that everything is picking everything criticized and everything and it's a precious little leaf that all it needs is water all it needs is water all it needs is the rock to open up for people that knows how to speak to that rock but Briana [Applause] Daniel Williams was dying he's out in a wheelchair his boy came to see him in a pair of shorts at the end of church service showed up in a pair of shorts I said something to the boy I said son you know what your daddy's preached and how he's tried to stand for truth I said it's offensive for you to come home to an address like this in front of the church and church people and right in the face of your daddy who's tried to hold to the truth and you're in a pair of shorts and Daniel looked he said Oh Tim he looked at me he looked at me he said Oh Tim he's just a thirsty soul a thirsty soul that somehow never got his roots in the water and he's out here trying to satisfy it with the world with sin with drunkenness with women with and here he comes and it shows us of innocence all over his body it's because he's thirsty and because of that you know he's thinking against the things of God but you know there's church members that get sticky are you with me that you become stickers you don't know this he you know it's just him there near a dry place and they need a revival hallelujah that's why we need water in every service that we have it because they're those that are still cactuses among us and they need a drink that's pinnacle so water I'm gonna make their leaves come out and become fellowship again instead of criticizing and finding fault Moses went to that rock that rock he was to get water out of this dry place God told Moses take that rock and gather the people gather the elders and I'll stand on the rock before you this rock was Christ that's what it represented Christ come on help me and man Moses took that rod that had brought judgment of old each other come on man it had smoked the waters and then it turned to blood it is smoke the frogs it is then called for frogs and corrupt their deaths and the Flies and ruptor they're dancin and brought darkness over the land rough death on the first floor and are you with me don't sound to the to the Red Sea and it switched it out there and it makes the way across and then lift it over again Aaron left and let down and waters come gentlemen it was a

here behind me today we have a crucifix that's not an idol that we worship that is simply a representation of Jesus death upon the cross it's given to me many many years ago in the 70s as a young pastor by a pastor friend brother George liquors and in Alabama and he gave me this crucifix here and but it's symbolic as we have it over this baptistry it's symbolic that we are to be dead and crucified with Christ and being that we're dead and crucified with Christ we are to rise in the newness of life after being buried and so of course we wouldn't just sprinkle a little water upon someone a little dirt upon someone and say they are buried but they must be immersed in water baptism and this is Scripture all through the Bible and there's never anywhere anywhere place in the Bible where anybody was ever baptized in any other way than the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and we come today in obedience to that to fulfill God's Word and to know that he sent us into all the world to preach the gospel and those that believed and that we that we would we are to baptize them and he gave us an order to baptize him in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Ghost and we know that name is the Lord Jesus Christ and so today in obedience to that divine command were coming today to bury sister Shasta she has testified that she has given her life to Christ the old man is dead and we are going to bury it that she might rise in the newness of life to serve the Lord Jesus as a new creation Amen sister Shasta we're just gonna pray a moment father for the glory of God we
