[50:38] heart would fail for
[50:40] fear all the trouble the turmoil that's

[50:49] something about that because it must
[50:50] have been talking about it in his time

[50:55] worst disease that there is in the world
[50:58] is heart trouble he said no it's sin

[58:44] inside he's got to bring this outside
[58:47] under control amen because he comes to
[58:50] live on the inside of you Revelation
[58:53] 10:1 for a scripture reading this
[58:55] morning
[59:00] pray for me I've been just a little bit
[59:01] under the weather since coming back from
[59:03] California but we're good today and
[59:06] going forward in the Lord we're going to
[59:08] be speaking on the living bride the
[59:12] final prophecy and as you notice our
[59:15] theme is on the mountains and movers and
[59:18] it comes from Zechariah 4 and seven who
[59:21] says who art thou a great Mountain Thou
[59:23] shalt become a Plaine and the headstone
[59:26] shall be for brought forth with shouting
[59:28] crying Grace Grace to it then Revelation
[59:31] 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[59:34] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[59:38] and a rainbow was up on his head and his
[59:41] face was as it were the Sun and he h and
[59:45] his feet as pillars of fire and he had
[59:48] in his little hand the little book open
[59:50] and he set his right foot on the sea and
[59:53] his left foot on the earth and he cried
[59:55] with a loud voice and as when a lion
[59:58] roar and when he cried seven Thunders
[1:00:00] uttered their voices and then verse
[1:00:02] seven but in the days of the voice of
[1:00:05] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:00:07] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:00:09] finished as he's declared to his
[1:00:12] servants of prophets and the voice which
[1:00:15] I heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[1:00:18] and said go and take the little book
[1:00:20] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:00:22] that standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:00:25] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[1:00:28] unto him give me the little book and he
[1:00:30] said take it and eat it up and it shall
[1:00:33] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[1:00:36] thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[1:00:39] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:00:42] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:00:45] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[1:00:48] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:00:51] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:00:54] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[1:00:57] Kings amen God bless you going to let
[1:00:59] you take your seats if you will turn
[1:01:02] with me to First Corinthians chapter 15
[1:01:05] we're going to read from the 51st
[1:01:08] verse 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:01:12] 15 verse
[1:01:15] 51 behold I show you a
[1:01:19] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[1:01:22] shall all be changed in a moment in the
[1:01:26] twinkling of an eye at the last
[1:01:31] Trump that's not Donald Trump
[1:01:34] either at the last Trump for the trumpet
[1:01:38] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:01:42] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:01:45] for this corruptible must put on
[1:01:48] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[1:01:51] immortality so when this corruptible
[1:01:54] shall I put on incorruption
[1:01:56] and this Mortal shall have put on
[1:01:58] immortality then shall be brought to
[1:02:00] pass the saying that is written death is
[1:02:03] swallowed up in Victory oh death where
[1:02:06] is thy sting oh grave where is thy
[1:02:09] Victory The Sting of death is sin the
[1:02:12] strength of sin is the law but thanks be
[1:02:15] to God who giveth us the victory through
[1:02:19] our Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless
[1:02:23] you what a wonderful hour to be serving
[1:02:27] God I would I would rather live in this
[1:02:30] day than any day that there could be God
[1:02:34] has called us to a very very special
[1:02:36] time in this hour it's it's the day
[1:02:38] where that there is a bride who will be
[1:02:42] alive and remain at the coming of the
[1:02:44] Lord it'll also be the bride who will
[1:02:47] have the final
[1:02:50] prophecy and and you will see it here
[1:02:53] even is spoke of in in the the scripture
[1:02:56] and we didn't read it but in Revelation
[1:02:58] 10: 7 said in the days of the voice of
[1:03:01] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:03:03] sound the mystery of God would be
[1:03:05] finished but yet as we see the finishing
[1:03:09] of the Mysteries and the coming down
[1:03:12] with the book we find that there is a
[1:03:16] final prophecy because she must prophesy
[1:03:20] again and so the final prophecy will be
[1:03:24] the bride's voice
[1:03:26] um the voice of God will be in her and
[1:03:28] it will be the final voice to the final
[1:03:32] age and of course we want to know what
[1:03:35] will be her message her message will be
[1:03:38] the resurrection message actually that
[1:03:41] is the message that Jesus had when he
[1:03:44] came it was his message of where he said
[1:03:48] I am the resurrection and the life and
[1:03:52] and so our message will be the same I
[1:03:55] I'm not dead but I am alive forever more
[1:03:59] never to go back to the tombs of
[1:04:02] religion and yet the message movement it
[1:04:05] will die and become a Mor and we go back
[1:04:09] to the tomb sealed there with Creeds but
[1:04:11] not the message the message will never
[1:04:15] die it will live on and neither will the
[1:04:18] bride die because she will not go down
[1:04:21] into death but the Bible tells us that
[1:04:24] I'm going to show you you mystery we are
[1:04:27] not going to all sleep but we shall all
[1:04:30] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:04:33] an eye so you see the story of the Bride
[1:04:38] ends here upon the Earth with the with
[1:04:41] the spirit and the bride speaking in
[1:04:44] unison if you notice in Revelation 22:17
[1:04:48] it says and the spirit and the bride say
[1:04:51] come and let him that heareth come so if
[1:04:55] you if you see what what it is you see
[1:04:59] the spirit and the bride is speaking
[1:05:02] together it's the last
[1:05:05] voice amen it's the last voice before
[1:05:09] the change you see you see the bride
[1:05:13] speaks the same word as does the spirit
[1:05:16] she is a word bride proven she has the
[1:05:19] spirit she's not like vasai in the days
[1:05:23] of Esther who had her own feast and
[1:05:26] refuse to come to the Feast of the king
[1:05:29] but the bride is in harmony with the
[1:05:33] bridegroom and the spirit and the bride
[1:05:35] say come notice they are speaking in
[1:05:39] unison it is not one Speaking one thing
[1:05:42] and the other speaking something else
[1:05:44] but they're both saying the same thing
[1:05:47] the spirit and the bride say notice it's
[1:05:52] they are they are speaking together not
[1:05:55] a part now that's not always been with
[1:05:58] the church there's been many a time that
[1:06:00] the church world has spoke and it has
[1:06:03] not been in unison with the spirit the
[1:06:06] spirit was speaking one thing and the
[1:06:08] church was speaking something else but
[1:06:11] in this last day it is prophesied it is
[1:06:14] written in the Bible that there is be a
[1:06:17] people on Earth who will be saying the
[1:06:19] same thing that the spirit said the
[1:06:22] spirit and the bride say come
[1:06:29] now let me just tell you that call come
[1:06:32] if you'll just search it through the
[1:06:33] Book of Revelation you know it is the
[1:06:35] call for the
[1:06:37] Rapture amen Revelation 4 shows you at
[1:06:41] the end of the leoan age that there is a
[1:06:44] door open in heaven and a voice saying
[1:06:46] come up
[1:06:47] hither and I want you to know that's the
[1:06:50] call of the bridegroom coming through
[1:06:53] the Bride come come out of her my people
[1:06:57] be you separate sayeth the Lord come
[1:06:59] into the word be a part of that word
[1:07:02] take that book and eat it become one
[1:07:05] with it now I want you to understand
[1:07:09] that we must do the works that Jesus
[1:07:12] did Jesus said so John 14:12 The Works
[1:07:16] that I do shall you do also and so we
[1:07:20] must be those who fulfill the New
[1:07:24] Testament even as Jesus fulfilled the
[1:07:27] Old Testament amen so here we are at the
[1:07:31] the last day and we must do what Jesus
[1:07:35] did in his day and what Jesus was he was
[1:07:40] the voice of the
[1:07:43] Resurrection I want you to notice in
[1:07:45] John 11:24 you remember Lazarus had died
[1:07:48] he was in the Tomb she come to him and
[1:07:51] said Lord if you know our brother if you
[1:07:53] had have been here our brother would
[1:07:55] have lived
[1:07:56] and he see he said well he he will he
[1:07:58] will live he will rise again said and so
[1:08:01] in verse 24 she said Martha said to him
[1:08:04] I know he shall rise again in the
[1:08:07] resurrection at the last day and Jesus
[1:08:11] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:08:16] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:08:18] dead yet shall he
[1:08:21] live amen so you see there no notice now
[1:08:25] I I want you to see the authority that
[1:08:28] was in his voice you see there was so
[1:08:31] much power within his voice had he not
[1:08:35] said Lazarus come forth then all the
[1:08:39] dead would have come
[1:08:40] forth but he you know again because that
[1:08:44] was the power that was in his voice the
[1:08:47] power was shown when he called Lazarus
[1:08:50] and he comes forth out of the Grave when
[1:08:52] he's been there 4 days amen and now
[1:08:56] notice Jesus before the resurrection he
[1:09:00] becomes the resurrection and he declares
[1:09:04] I am the resurrection and the
[1:09:10] life amen now so what happened in the
[1:09:14] groom must also happen in The Bride for
[1:09:17] the same word that speaks of the groom
[1:09:20] speaks also of the Bride so there must
[1:09:24] be a resurrection in the end time and
[1:09:27] Jesus was the resurrection and so here
[1:09:31] in this end time there must become a
[1:09:34] people that is become the revelation of
[1:09:37] the hour and if the Revelation the
[1:09:40] unfolding of the hour is the
[1:09:41] resurrection they must become the
[1:09:47] resurrection now you know that already
[1:09:50] because you've already experienced the
[1:09:52] resurrection is that right you were dead
[1:09:55] in sins and
[1:09:57] trespasses and you're given voice that
[1:10:00] you're no longer that dead
[1:10:03] thing amen that life that you once lived
[1:10:06] in the flesh you no longer live that
[1:10:09] anymore but you live by the faith of the
[1:10:12] Son of God notice so I want you to see
[1:10:16] this that there must be a people become
[1:10:19] the revelation of the hour that they can
[1:10:21] come to the point that they can say I am
[1:10:23] the resurrection I am the embodiment of
[1:10:27] the Resurrection Resurrection Life and
[1:10:30] resurrection power Works within me now
[1:10:33] for the spirit quickens my mortal
[1:10:38] body you know one time you lived in
[1:10:41] sin you know the life you lived but the
[1:10:45] Holy Spirit came to make you alive
[1:10:49] that's what the word quickens mean make
[1:10:51] you alive you were dead but now you're
[1:10:55] alive I said you were dead but now
[1:10:59] you're alive and it what's it do it
[1:11:01] quickens your mortal body you that you
[1:11:05] once wanted to live Unholy dirty lives
[1:11:09] have now been quickened to Holiness to
[1:11:12] righteousness to the power of
[1:11:15] God it brought a change in
[1:11:18] you amen now for the spirit now quickens
[1:11:23] your mortal body that that's a that's
[1:11:26] the evidence you've turned
[1:11:29] Heavenly now notice as we look at this
[1:11:34] we may wonder and
[1:11:36] Ponder well why is the bride his
[1:11:41] voice because in the Book of Revelation
[1:11:44] chapter
[1:11:46] 3 when it speaks of the leodan age he
[1:11:50] tells you very clearly that the church
[1:11:53] world has been spewed out of his
[1:11:56] mouth is that right because that you are
[1:12:00] lukewarm neither cold nor hot because
[1:12:03] you say I am rich and increased with
[1:12:06] goods and I have need of nothing yet
[1:12:08] you're miserable wretched blind naked
[1:12:12] and don't know it and he he goes on to
[1:12:15] say I will spew you out of my mouth now
[1:12:19] what's he talking about he means that
[1:12:22] the church is no longer his mouth
[1:12:26] piece they no longer speak for him it's
[1:12:30] his own
[1:12:32] mouthpiece amen I mean come on look at
[1:12:36] even what the church world says you know
[1:12:38] you just you just take a scripture or
[1:12:39] two just take First Corinthians 11 about
[1:12:42] what the scripture says Paul saying a
[1:12:45] woman should have uncut hair a man
[1:12:47] should should have cut
[1:12:48] hair and what would they say oh that
[1:12:52] don't apply to
[1:12:53] me so did she get from that she's her
[1:12:56] own
[1:12:57] mouth because she's no longer God's
[1:13:00] mouth I'm just taking a simple scripture
[1:13:01] what about water baptism in the name of
[1:13:04] Jesus Christ amen she becomes her own
[1:13:08] mouth or she'll say I'd rather do what
[1:13:10] Jesus said than what Peter said but I
[1:13:13] want you to understand that was Jesus
[1:13:15] speaking through
[1:13:16] Peter that was the Holy Ghost upon a man
[1:13:19] of God Amen that was the spirit of Jesus
[1:13:22] that had returned on the day of
[1:13:24] Pentecost
[1:13:25] the Holy Ghost amen the spirit of Christ
[1:13:28] and he had come and Peter there with the
[1:13:31] with the keys to the kingdom said repent
[1:13:33] every one of you here's the way to get
[1:13:35] in repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:13:38] Jesus Christ for remission of sin and
[1:13:41] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:13:43] Ghost but the church becomes its own
[1:13:48] mouthpiece so therefore it refuses what
[1:13:51] the word says so God is turning on her
[1:13:57] I I'm just giving you just a couple
[1:13:59] incidents I mean it's full of it in the
[1:14:02] scripture so God's turning on her he
[1:14:05] will confound her through the prophet
[1:14:08] and the bride for the voice of God will
[1:14:11] be in
[1:14:13] her amen you know here again we have a
[1:14:16] lot of debate about where the voice of
[1:14:18] God
[1:14:20] is but I want you to understand the
[1:14:22] seventh angel has sounded his message
[1:14:26] amen the mysteries of God are finished
[1:14:30] but where are we in this time you see we
[1:14:32] are in a time where the voice of God
[1:14:36] will be in The Bride for it says in that
[1:14:40] last chapter of of Revelation it said
[1:14:43] the spirit and the bride say come so
[1:14:46] once more and I'm quoting brother
[1:14:48] Brandon once more the world will hear
[1:14:51] direct from God as at Pentecost
[1:14:56] amen you see Jesus had went away his
[1:15:00] voice was no longer being preached
[1:15:03] through the man Jesus no longer was he
[1:15:06] on the seashore speaking the Beatitudes
[1:15:09] but now he was speaking in the form of a
[1:15:14] Ministry of a bride form come on and on
[1:15:17] the day of Pentecost his Spirit came in
[1:15:20] them and they became the voice of God
[1:15:23] for their age
[1:15:26] now I want you to
[1:15:28] understand of course they will repudiate
[1:15:31] that they'll deny it they'll turn it
[1:15:33] down but the voice of God is in the
[1:15:36] bride in leoda this church is peed out
[1:15:40] of God's mouth no longer speaks for him
[1:15:42] but the bride under their messeng under
[1:15:44] their messenger is the final voice for
[1:15:47] the final age I quote this from we would
[1:15:50] see Jesus he doesn't have any hands but
[1:15:54] ours
[1:15:55] he doesn't have any voice but ours how
[1:15:59] many knows that you mean some of you
[1:16:01] don't know that sure you do what do you
[1:16:04] say I'm the vine you're the branches the
[1:16:06] bran the vine doesn't bear the fruit it
[1:16:08] energizes the branch the branches bear
[1:16:11] the fruit it energizes the branches and
[1:16:15] and John 15 I'm the vine you're the
[1:16:17] branches we lay hands on the sick he
[1:16:20] uses our eyes to see Visions he he uses
[1:16:25] our lips to speak he uses us to pack the
[1:16:30] gospel it's given to his church and he's
[1:16:33] in his church manifests himself and the
[1:16:36] people can see him as he works in his
[1:16:41] church amen now so you see this is what
[1:16:45] he does he uses Ministry even as brother
[1:16:48] brandham tells us in the message look he
[1:16:50] said God could have chose to preach the
[1:16:53] gospel by the son by the Moon by the
[1:16:55] Stars by The Wind by nature but he chose
[1:16:59] men to preach the
[1:17:01] gospel amen and that's where the voice
[1:17:04] of God will come from men preaching the
[1:17:08] gospel you say well brother Tim then I
[1:17:10] won't have the voice of God because I'm
[1:17:12] not a preacher every one of you are the
[1:17:14] voice of God you everyone are preaching
[1:17:17] a sermon every one of you are given a
[1:17:20] life
[1:17:21] testimony are you with me so you are The
[1:17:24] Voice voice of God that is here in this
[1:17:28] age that is speaking out if you want to
[1:17:30] know what God thinks about the scripture
[1:17:34] amen it's going to be manifested in
[1:17:37] you is that right you want to think know
[1:17:40] what God thinks about Holiness it's
[1:17:41] going to be manifested it's going to be
[1:17:44] displayed it's going to be ministered in
[1:17:46] a bright
[1:17:48] body now so you see that's where the
[1:17:51] voice of God has come from of course you
[1:17:53] can judge whether it's the voice of God
[1:17:55] by whether it's according to the word
[1:17:58] cuz God can't be across contrary to his
[1:18:00] word notice as we look at
[1:18:05] this and I'm going to read again from
[1:18:07] the church age
[1:18:09] book Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the
[1:18:13] bride say come the corn of wheat the
[1:18:17] bride wheat that fell in the ground at
[1:18:19] NAA has come back to the original word
[1:18:22] grain again
[1:18:24] I love that she's come back to the
[1:18:27] Head she come back to the Capstone the
[1:18:30] finished praise God forever yes listen
[1:18:34] to the authenticated prophet of God who
[1:18:36] appears in this last stage what he says
[1:18:38] from God the bride will
[1:18:40] say and the spirit and the prophet and
[1:18:43] the bride will be saying the same
[1:18:47] thing and what they say will have
[1:18:49] already been said in the
[1:18:52] word and they are saying it now
[1:18:56] now
[1:18:57] come and he says come out from among her
[1:19:01] and be you separate now you know that's
[1:19:03] Revelation
[1:19:04] 18 amen the cry is going out the cry is
[1:19:07] going out how long will the voice cry we
[1:19:09] don't know but one thing we know it
[1:19:11] won't be long cuz this is the last
[1:19:16] age so after this
[1:19:18] voice that cause the people to come up
[1:19:21] hither there will not be another voice
[1:19:22] to the Gentiles that's right
[1:19:26] they the prophet and the bride and the
[1:19:29] spirit say the same thing and they have
[1:19:31] the same message
[1:19:35] come come out and that's what we're
[1:19:38] saying we're saying come out of those
[1:19:42] tombs amen get rid of the
[1:19:45] restraints don't be bound down by ideas
[1:19:48] and Creeds of man throw off those
[1:19:52] chains come on Church it was the spirit
[1:19:55] that was in Jesus that broke the seals
[1:19:57] of the
[1:19:59] Tomb right it wasn't the Romans taking
[1:20:01] them off it was an external job it
[1:20:04] wasn't the disciples do it and we can't
[1:20:06] do it for you it's going to take a work
[1:20:09] of the holy spirit in ever life I'll
[1:20:11] tell you he'll break the chains of sin
[1:20:13] the Yoke of
[1:20:14] Darkness amen he will break every fed he
[1:20:19] will take the Creeds off of you and
[1:20:21] that's what we're trying to say in this
[1:20:23] day our call is come come yes come out
[1:20:26] of the Tomb come out of those
[1:20:29] restrictions come into the freedom of
[1:20:32] the Holy Spirit Come where the spirit of
[1:20:34] God is moving we're not talking about
[1:20:37] come to evening light Tabernacle we're
[1:20:39] talking about come out of the
[1:20:45] Tomb you
[1:20:48] know a lot of
[1:20:51] people you know have asked me about
[1:20:56] California so brother Tim you just went
[1:20:58] and preached to California don't them
[1:21:00] people believe the message why are they
[1:21:02] still
[1:21:04] there I don't think sometimes we hear
[1:21:07] what the word said that's right and the
[1:21:09] word never said leave
[1:21:12] California it said
[1:21:14] flee flee and run to the horns of the
[1:21:19] altar come out of that of that that sin
[1:21:23] that you're in and
[1:21:26] repent amen it you know I tell you what
[1:21:29] the it ain't going to matter where you
[1:21:30] are when the earthquake takes place if
[1:21:32] you're a Believer you're sealed in with
[1:21:34] God you'll go up with
[1:21:38] him but if you're not a Believer you're
[1:21:40] going to be left behind it's just that
[1:21:42] simple that's right it is not a physical
[1:21:45] location you got to be in it's in Christ
[1:21:47] you've got to be
[1:21:49] [Applause]
[1:21:51] in so we've got a lot of ideas a lot of
[1:21:54] times it is a physical place and even
[1:21:57] brother brandham was asked question
[1:21:59] answers 64 you know brother brandham
[1:22:02] should we all move here should we all go
[1:22:03] to tuon should we go some say go here
[1:22:06] some say he says get into
[1:22:12] Christ your physical location you can
[1:22:15] sit right here in this church and
[1:22:17] rot die right on the vine dry up right
[1:22:22] and be in the tombs bound down by
[1:22:28] sin say well Set Me Free this morning
[1:22:30] brother Tim no it's you that's got to
[1:22:33] invite him in and open the door and he
[1:22:37] will he will then break the seals off
[1:22:39] your
[1:22:41] life now so that's what we're saying
[1:22:44] come out of the tombs get rid of the
[1:22:47] restraints
[1:22:48] yes I know I know sometimes people get
[1:22:51] upset because we worship God and and we
[1:22:54] might shout or and and and get exuberant
[1:22:57] in our worship or dance in the spirit
[1:22:59] but we're just saying come
[1:23:02] out break the
[1:23:04] chains amen the things that's been
[1:23:07] holding you down break them get it where
[1:23:09] you're free in the spirit get it word
[1:23:12] that you can receive the word and it
[1:23:14] change your life and transform
[1:23:21] you now Jesus
[1:23:25] became the voice or the manifestation of
[1:23:27] the
[1:23:28] scriptures and so must the bride the
[1:23:32] voice of the word will be spoken through
[1:23:36] her the last
[1:23:40] prophecy I read it to you this morning
[1:23:43] Thou shalt prophesy again I I
[1:23:47] accentuated you again and and and with
[1:23:51] with Revelation 21 where he says the
[1:23:54] spirit of the Bride say
[1:23:58] come so the Jesus became the voice or
[1:24:02] the manifestation of the scripture and
[1:24:05] so must the bride the voice of the word
[1:24:08] will be spoken through her now watch
[1:24:11] what Jesus would say he would say some
[1:24:13] very peculiar things for example destroy
[1:24:17] this
[1:24:18] Temple and I'll raise it up again in
[1:24:20] three days now he's walking right among
[1:24:23] the temple the beautiful
[1:24:26] structures of uh of all of that you know
[1:24:29] the and and the disciples were showing
[1:24:31] him the wonders of the
[1:24:34] temple and Jesus pointed from there and
[1:24:37] he and he pointed to the to the real
[1:24:41] Temple God was no longer in that form of
[1:24:45] religion he was now in a person Jesus
[1:24:51] Christ and he said destroy this Temple
[1:24:54] and I'll raise it up again in three days
[1:24:58] well they said it was so many years that
[1:25:00] they took building this Temple how are
[1:25:02] you going to raise it up in three days
[1:25:05] but Jesus was talking about his own
[1:25:07] flesh you see why because he was to
[1:25:10] fulfill the scripture he said I will not
[1:25:13] leave his soul in
[1:25:15] Hell neither will I let my Holy One see
[1:25:19] corruption is't that wonderful scripture
[1:25:22] we know that corruption sets in in 72
[1:25:25] hours so before 3 days he had to
[1:25:28] rise so he knew he would raise in 3
[1:25:32] days cuz he could look in the scripture
[1:25:35] listen he looked at what was thought as
[1:25:38] a remote
[1:25:43] Psalm a forgotten neglected
[1:25:46] scripture but Jesus saw himself in it I
[1:25:51] want to ask you this morning can you see
[1:25:53] yourself in it
[1:25:55] it are you with me amen can you can you
[1:26:00] can you see yourself in can you see that
[1:26:03] he's not going to leave this bride in
[1:26:10] hell do you know do you know hell is
[1:26:13] about to to come through in this
[1:26:16] Dimension is pressing harder every
[1:26:19] day demons streaming loose everywhere
[1:26:23] Spirits like you've never
[1:26:26] seen evil horrible things going on in
[1:26:29] the world that we're living in worst
[1:26:32] time than ever before yes
[1:26:37] sir and do you know hell is about to be
[1:26:39] created on this Earth I can show you in
[1:26:42] Revelation CH 12 when the bride goes
[1:26:46] up Satan comes down that's right let me
[1:26:51] tell you he don't descend he's cast down
[1:26:53] right
[1:26:54] he says in Revelation 9 I saw this star
[1:26:58] fall from Heaven it was not a it was not
[1:27:02] a descending Christ descends but this
[1:27:05] one
[1:27:06] Falls and in Revelation 12 he shows he
[1:27:09] is cast
[1:27:12] down when as the bride goes
[1:27:16] up and so if he comes down then what's
[1:27:20] he going to do he has but a short time
[1:27:24] and he establishes his full Eden in that
[1:27:28] short three and a half years of
[1:27:31] tribulation you ain't seen nothing yet
[1:27:35] and you don't want to see
[1:27:40] that but God says okay come on come on
[1:27:44] into this Dimension bring all your
[1:27:46] kingdom and all your powers loose all
[1:27:49] your spirits and bring them right down
[1:27:51] into this last age because when I get
[1:27:54] you here I'm going to pull my bride out
[1:27:57] and then I'm going to pour out the vials
[1:27:58] of judgment upon the Earth and I'm going
[1:28:00] to plague the beast in his
[1:28:04] system and at the end Satan will be
[1:28:07] bound for a thousand
[1:28:09] years amen we we we're looking for
[1:28:12] restraints being put on the devil we're
[1:28:15] looking for a Time on the Earth where
[1:28:17] there'll be a millennial Reign and
[1:28:19] arrest for God's people but I want you
[1:28:22] to notice he said I will not leave his
[1:28:25] soul in hell that's right he ain't going
[1:28:28] to leave this briide
[1:28:31] here and he will not allow us to go down
[1:28:35] and
[1:28:37] Decay for he says neither shall my Holy
[1:28:41] One see
[1:28:44] corruption so don't you see no matter
[1:28:47] what's going on in this world you've got
[1:28:50] a you've got a promise of a scripture
[1:28:53] that you are part of a
[1:28:58] resurrection amen now Jesus was a
[1:29:01] fulfillment of types we could go through
[1:29:03] many of them but he would look back and
[1:29:06] he would see another obscure prophet and
[1:29:09] he would liking himself to
[1:29:11] him man by the name of Jonah and he said
[1:29:15] as Jonas is in the belly of the well
[1:29:18] three days and nights so will the son of
[1:29:20] the son of man be in the heart of the
[1:29:22] Earth
[1:29:24] you see he saw himself there he saw
[1:29:28] himself in that prophecy amen because he
[1:29:32] was a fulfilling of the type and we can
[1:29:35] look back to Jesus and see the bride and
[1:29:37] the groom but
[1:29:39] because Believe It or Not Jesus is your
[1:29:46] type he was foreshadowing a bride
[1:29:50] coming now you say but how do does that
[1:29:54] apply to me you know you just read about
[1:29:58] he'll not leave his soul in Hell or Holy
[1:30:00] One seek corruption well listen to this
[1:30:02] what about Jonas and the w three
[1:30:05] days restoration from the brigh tree
[1:30:08] just as he sure as he raised Jesus out
[1:30:11] of the Grave under three days under
[1:30:15] three dispensations or three sections
[1:30:17] he's going to raise the church to its
[1:30:20] fullness and power again
[1:30:26] and he said notice after three days of
[1:30:29] first treat talking about the
[1:30:31] groom restored as at the beginning
[1:30:34] having the same signs wonders Jesus come
[1:30:36] back the same Jesus doing the same
[1:30:39] things at the end of the third day the
[1:30:42] signs appeared not at the end of the
[1:30:44] first day brother I hope you're getting
[1:30:45] it at the third day is when the real
[1:30:47] manifestation of Christ was made known
[1:30:50] at the end of the third day notice not
[1:30:53] at the first day Day dead for the second
[1:30:56] day still dead Luther Wesley at the
[1:30:59] beginning of the third day there was a
[1:31:01] rumor
[1:31:03] around you know what was going on the
[1:31:06] Holy Spirit was being poured out at ausa
[1:31:09] Street there was a rumor going around
[1:31:12] and he said nothing on the first day
[1:31:14] that was Luther nothing on the second
[1:31:16] day that was Wesley and on the third day
[1:31:18] the dispensation of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:20] there was a rumor around that he was the
[1:31:24] same yesterday today and
[1:31:26] forever but at the end of the third day
[1:31:30] that's where he made himself manifest
[1:31:32] and made himself known come right back
[1:31:34] among them come among his people and
[1:31:36] said look at me I'm the same
[1:31:39] one Hallelujah do you realize there'll
[1:31:42] be a bride in this last day that'll say
[1:31:44] look at me I am the same one the one
[1:31:47] that went
[1:31:49] down 2,000 years ago amen that said that
[1:31:53] that the
[1:31:54] and was in the tombs of Luther and
[1:31:56] Wesley and still dead and distill forms
[1:31:59] and then there was a then there was a
[1:32:01] rumor that he's
[1:32:03] alive but at the end of the third day he
[1:32:06] shows and he says I'm the same
[1:32:09] Jesus I'm the same bride that I was at
[1:32:12] this beginning there's a people on earth
[1:32:15] going to be able to say that
[1:32:21] amen now so there were dead forms till
[1:32:25] they got to Pentecost then there was a
[1:32:28] rumor around that he was now here in
[1:32:31] this last day he's right with us moving
[1:32:34] right among us at the end of the third
[1:32:36] day he appeared and showed all of them
[1:32:39] his resurrection
[1:32:41] sign that he's living the same yesterday
[1:32:44] today and forever living fruits of his
[1:32:46] presence are you getting it was
[1:32:49] manifested at the end of the third day
[1:32:51] when he appeared to all of them his
[1:32:53] church why they got it all together then
[1:32:56] at the end of the third day and here he
[1:32:59] goes and some of them didn't get the
[1:33:03] message you know it seem like no matter
[1:33:05] how hard you try some people don't get
[1:33:08] the
[1:33:13] message no matter how hard you preach it
[1:33:16] some people didn't this don't click with
[1:33:21] them they go right along let me just
[1:33:24] take a minute on this Apollos was there
[1:33:28] a man a devout man a mighty
[1:33:32] preacher knowing only the baptism of
[1:33:36] John this is way over the book of Acts
[1:33:39] chapter
[1:33:42] 18 and and here he's preaching about
[1:33:45] John about God sending Elijah a book
[1:33:48] about God sending a message and he said
[1:33:51] the Messiah is here
[1:33:54] somewhere we don't know we don't know
[1:33:56] him now a't that
[1:33:58] strange he had been positively
[1:34:01] identified by the
[1:34:03] prophet and that's the world we're
[1:34:06] living in today there are many people
[1:34:07] still searching for a
[1:34:10] messiah they're looking here for this
[1:34:13] leader to raise up or this or this
[1:34:15] savior to come their world is falling
[1:34:17] apart and they're looking for somebody
[1:34:20] else with some great power to some great
[1:34:23] Charisma some great
[1:34:25] knowledge that will lead him
[1:34:30] higher because they don't recognize the
[1:34:33] one that was pointed
[1:34:36] to I want you to get this because God
[1:34:40] sent us an Elijah in this day and he
[1:34:42] told us the Messiah is
[1:34:45] here now it ain't him through it it
[1:34:48] ain't even a preacher that I can
[1:34:51] name it's the word it's the anointed
[1:34:54] word come on and he pointed us to the
[1:34:57] word and said here's your savior here's
[1:35:00] your Messiah here's the one that's going
[1:35:03] to save you in this last day I'm sending
[1:35:06] you a
[1:35:07] message of
[1:35:09] Deliverance but people miss it so
[1:35:12] they're always looking for somebody else
[1:35:14] to raise up some somebody with a shiny
[1:35:18] something and and here these men were
[1:35:20] they were in this very time and here
[1:35:23] apsis sincerely preaching and he's
[1:35:26] missed the very purpose of Elijah yet he
[1:35:29] can say I'm in the
[1:35:36] message man I tell you what he put that
[1:35:40] Jezebel in her place man yes he did he
[1:35:43] told old her herodes you know her wrong
[1:35:47] called her out called her out in the
[1:35:49] street and shot her she had her had his
[1:35:52] head cut off because of it he preached
[1:35:56] marriage and divorce my he was a mighty
[1:35:59] preacher and you talk about bringing
[1:36:01] high mountains down he did making low
[1:36:04] valleys and bringing them up making a
[1:36:06] level plane the plane's level but we're
[1:36:08] looking for the
[1:36:10] Messiah how many people are in that
[1:36:13] condition today that they have not yet
[1:36:15] seen who we were poed to Jesus Christ
[1:36:19] the anointed
[1:36:22] word did you get into Acts chapter 19
[1:36:25] and some of his followers were there and
[1:36:29] Paul said okay you're Believers have you
[1:36:32] received the Holy Ghost and they said we
[1:36:36] hadn't even
[1:36:37] heard there is such a thing is the Holy
[1:36:41] Ghost what are you talking about listen
[1:36:45] these were followers of
[1:36:49] Elijah they believe the
[1:36:51] Forerunner but it not even received the
[1:36:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost they had
[1:36:57] missed the very purpose of him
[1:37:01] coming they missed the token
[1:37:08] itself they missed the very
[1:37:12] experience that would have introduced
[1:37:14] them and made the word real to
[1:37:19] them is't that
[1:37:22] amazing these people people were sitting
[1:37:24] on the church pews they weren bad
[1:37:26] people no doubt they were tithe payers
[1:37:28] and good members
[1:37:31] and maybe get the pat on the back from
[1:37:33] Good Old Apollos for being good good
[1:37:35] people they wern't Christians CU they
[1:37:37] didn't know
[1:37:39] Christ but
[1:37:41] here in John and and Paul said well how
[1:37:44] was you baptized well we got baptized by
[1:37:47] John he saidwell have you not heard to
[1:37:50] be baptized taken on the name of Jesus
[1:37:52] Christ
[1:37:55] have you not heard they said no we've
[1:37:57] not heard that and he baptized them all
[1:37:59] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:02] amen and the Holy Ghost Came Upon them
[1:38:04] and they were filled with the spirit and
[1:38:06] they spoke in tongues and
[1:38:08] prophesied they had an
[1:38:11] experience when they begin to realize
[1:38:14] what the message was really all
[1:38:19] about somehow another we get confused
[1:38:23] we think the message is about a
[1:38:27] man the man is not the
[1:38:31] message the the message is is Christ
[1:38:36] that's who the message is amen the
[1:38:39] messenger is is a man and God uses him
[1:38:43] and God bless him and thanks be to God
[1:38:45] for him but if you never come to know
[1:38:48] Christ you've lost everything
[1:39:02] so he lifts real
[1:39:06] instructions about where he wanted his
[1:39:10] people to meet him after his
[1:39:14] resurrection he said go to the city of
[1:39:17] Jerusalem and wait there until you're
[1:39:20] endued with powerful on high don't go
[1:39:23] out and priest don't go have Divine
[1:39:24] Healing campaigns don't don't go start
[1:39:28] churches until you until you get endued
[1:39:31] with power from on
[1:39:34] high so you see he had a designated
[1:39:38] place he wanted them to meet them do you
[1:39:40] know there is a designated place that we
[1:39:43] are to meet
[1:39:45] him we are to meet him in the
[1:39:51] air we're in the world is the
[1:39:54] air it's that
[1:39:56] Dimension Between Heaven and Earth as he
[1:39:59] comes here and we go there amen and the
[1:40:02] blending of Dimension you're going to
[1:40:04] have to leave the Dominion of sin and
[1:40:06] dimension of sin that you're in you're
[1:40:09] going to have to rise up above that
[1:40:11] you're going to have to come into the
[1:40:12] dimension where all things are possible
[1:40:15] to them that
[1:40:18] believe so you see again he had a he has
[1:40:22] a designated place for us to meet him
[1:40:26] and that is to meet him in the
[1:40:28] air and there is it's a physical place
[1:40:31] we're going to go where we shall be
[1:40:34] changed but you know there were men
[1:40:37] going the opposite
[1:40:39] direction after all these instructions
[1:40:42] and even the angel coming back with an
[1:40:45] instruction go tell my
[1:40:47] disciples that I will meet them in
[1:40:51] Jerusalem go tell I mean here's the
[1:40:54] message from the angel and here are two
[1:40:57] men and they're going down the road to
[1:41:00] emus in the opposite
[1:41:04] direction how many times will people
[1:41:08] hear direct instructions from God and go
[1:41:11] the wrong
[1:41:15] direction and as they went they were
[1:41:18] talking about their
[1:41:21] unbelief they were talking about out how
[1:41:24] disappointed they
[1:41:26] were because things had not turned out
[1:41:29] the way they thought you know it's 2025
[1:41:32] we thought it' been over a long time
[1:41:34] before they were walking along and
[1:41:37] saying you know um you know how could it
[1:41:40] how is it even possible that this wasn't
[1:41:43] the one how I mean my goodness he healed
[1:41:46] the sick he raised the dead and we we
[1:41:49] thought sure he would deliver Israel see
[1:41:51] they had the wrong expectations
[1:41:53] he certainly would deliver them but he
[1:41:56] would be their savior from their
[1:41:59] sins but here they're walk in the
[1:42:02] opposite direction after getting Divine
[1:42:05] instructions from
[1:42:06] God go to Jerusalem now they're going to
[1:42:11] amas but I want you to know just like
[1:42:15] Apollos just like those in Acts chapter
[1:42:19] 19 they were elect of God and God wasn't
[1:42:22] going to leave them squandering around
[1:42:23] in
[1:42:25] unbelief and I'm telling you what the
[1:42:27] Holy Spirit even today is going after
[1:42:29] those going in the wrong
[1:42:32] direction and you might be purposely
[1:42:34] going in the wrong
[1:42:36] direction but here you'll come walking
[1:42:38] among
[1:42:40] you and tell you where you are going
[1:42:44] wrong and say look it's been me it's
[1:42:47] been me it's been me all the way down
[1:42:50] from Genesis all the way down through
[1:42:52] revelation through the seven Church ages
[1:42:54] till now it's been
[1:42:58] me and he unfolded the scriptures
[1:43:01] concerning
[1:43:06] himself you know what they had to do he
[1:43:09] made like he would pass them
[1:43:12] by and they had to compel
[1:43:15] him come in with us comes up with
[1:43:21] us you want Jesus in your
[1:43:24] life you have to compel
[1:43:27] him you have to say Lord Don't Pass Me
[1:43:30] By come into my life come into my heart
[1:43:32] come into my being change me in your
[1:43:35] presence don't let whatever it is don't
[1:43:37] leave me where you found me don't let me
[1:43:40] keep walking on down to amus when I've
[1:43:43] been called to The Upper
[1:43:45] Room amen and may maybe we're not called
[1:43:48] to the upper room but we're called to
[1:43:50] the place we're going
[1:43:51] upward are you with me
[1:43:53] amen so here they here at there he he on
[1:43:57] the inside he showed them the sign of
[1:44:00] the Resurrection he did things like he
[1:44:03] did
[1:44:08] before you know if we want to see loved
[1:44:10] ones loss that are going the wrong
[1:44:12] direction we're going to have to let
[1:44:16] them see things that he did
[1:44:20] before he healed before
[1:44:23] he filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:44:26] before he opened the eyes of blind
[1:44:28] before I'm talking about spiritual
[1:44:29] blindness too amen he was a deliverer
[1:44:33] come on we got to have a living God he's
[1:44:36] got to show himself
[1:44:38] alive otherwise they have every right to
[1:44:42] give go in the wrong
[1:44:45] direction but
[1:44:47] notice
[1:44:50] remember he was the first fruits of
[1:44:52] those who slept even as the Old
[1:44:56] Testament remember we've been through it
[1:44:58] of the waving of the sheath and that was
[1:45:01] when the crops would come to harvest and
[1:45:06] before they could partake of it a sheep
[1:45:09] of grain was taken and would be waved
[1:45:12] before before the people and and so you
[1:45:15] know they waved before God actually and
[1:45:19] as as a sign as a great sign of the of
[1:45:22] the
[1:45:23] of that of the completion of the Harvest
[1:45:27] and so we remember he was the first
[1:45:32] fruits of the Old
[1:45:35] Testament and there even as the Old
[1:45:38] Testament type of the waving of the
[1:45:41] first ripen grain for the Harvest to be
[1:45:43] accepted by God even so as the priest
[1:45:47] were going that morning to the temple on
[1:45:49] the first day of the week at the same
[1:45:52] time
[1:45:53] Jesus rose from the dead as a
[1:45:55] fulfillment of that
[1:45:58] type think about that and then on the
[1:46:01] day of Pentecost which is seven weeks
[1:46:04] later representing seven Church ages
[1:46:07] Here Comes again another Shea
[1:46:11] waving because we come to another crop
[1:46:14] that was a the first was The Barley now
[1:46:16] this is the wheat and we come to the
[1:46:18] wheat Harvest where the wheat comes to
[1:46:21] Total maturity are you with me now
[1:46:26] listen there again then must be the
[1:46:30] waving of the
[1:46:32] sheath God picking up a group of
[1:46:36] people I want you I want you to get this
[1:46:39] and waving them before the
[1:46:42] world and says this is my bride and away
[1:46:45] he'll go with
[1:46:50] her now in the rising of the son brother
[1:46:53] Bron says as Christ was the first one to
[1:46:57] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[1:47:00] all so although typed in many places he
[1:47:02] was the first fruits of those that
[1:47:05] slept in the bride coming of Christ I
[1:47:08] want you to see this stop for a minute
[1:47:12] that's where we're at we're in the bride
[1:47:16] coming of who
[1:47:19] Christ 2,000 years he came in Groom form
[1:47:24] but in this day he comes in briide
[1:47:28] form and he must manifest himself
[1:47:31] completely in Bride form before a
[1:47:35] Rapture can take
[1:47:37] place so if you're looking for the great
[1:47:40] meeting in the
[1:47:41] air that's
[1:47:43] wonderful but it can't happen until
[1:47:47] there comes a bride who is
[1:47:50] manifested so I want you to see this in
[1:47:52] the coming to Christ coming out of the
[1:47:55] church there will be a sheath waved
[1:47:58] again at the last day what another first
[1:48:01] fruits waving of the sheath what was the
[1:48:03] Sheep the first to come to mature the
[1:48:05] first that proved it was a wheat that
[1:48:07] proved it was sheath Hallelujah I'm sure
[1:48:10] you see what I'm talking about it was
[1:48:12] waved over the people and for the first
[1:48:15] time there will come forth for the bride
[1:48:18] age for a resurrection out of dark
[1:48:22] denomination nationalism get a picture
[1:48:25] now in 3 days it would
[1:48:29] rise come on starting with
[1:48:32] Luther
[1:48:35] Wesley ausa street but here at the end
[1:48:39] he would show himself alive notice for a
[1:48:43] resurrection where out of dark
[1:48:48] denominationalism Hallelujah will be a
[1:48:50] message that the full mat of the word
[1:48:54] has turned back again in his full power
[1:48:56] and is being waved over the People by
[1:48:58] the same signs and wonders that he did
[1:49:00] back there I don't know what you're
[1:49:02] expecting but this has to come to
[1:49:06] pass amen oh I can hear brother brandham
[1:49:09] say in 1963 if the church could only be
[1:49:13] in the Glorious presence of God someday
[1:49:16] God will turn loose his power into it
[1:49:19] and things will take place
[1:49:23] I don't know brother I don't know if
[1:49:24] you're ready for that but I'm ready for
[1:49:27] it I've seen too much play in church
[1:49:30] I've seen too much of just turning the
[1:49:33] pages of the
[1:49:35] calendar here we've come already now to
[1:49:38] to February the now the 2nd and now the
[1:49:43] month of January is gone but even more
[1:49:46] it's more of a milestone than that
[1:49:48] yesterday I I marked 55 years of
[1:49:51] ministry
[1:49:53] where me a young boy 15 years old began
[1:49:57] a
[1:49:58] Ministry 55 years
[1:50:00] ago but I'm telling you I'm just tired
[1:50:03] of marking
[1:50:05] time amen there's got to be a people
[1:50:07] that that could be so in the glorious
[1:50:10] power of God presence of God that
[1:50:13] someday God could loose his power into
[1:50:18] it and he says the church is ready now
[1:50:20] listen church we know the world is is
[1:50:22] ready for his
[1:50:25] burning he tells us the hour is we're
[1:50:27] living oh God the world's falling apart
[1:50:30] they hangs in the hangers bombs their
[1:50:33] hangs in the the things that to do just
[1:50:36] exactly they've already moved the
[1:50:39] clock again saying it's closer to
[1:50:42] midnight than
[1:50:44] ever and he goes on to said the church
[1:50:48] is ready she is sealed in ready to come
[1:50:54] and there will be a big outpouring of
[1:50:57] the spirit yes sir to grab that church
[1:51:00] and take her into the
[1:51:01] disguise exactly because the church the
[1:51:04] word the bride and Christ his ministry
[1:51:07] is in his bride which his body is his
[1:51:09] body the supernatural body of his here
[1:51:12] on Earth his spirit is in there living
[1:51:16] his life out until him and the church
[1:51:18] becomes one in the wedding they become
[1:51:21] one
[1:51:25] Hallelujah a big outpouring of the
[1:51:28] spirit H oh he says this God's Little
[1:51:33] Flock that believes this word the
[1:51:35] mechanics its mechanics is ready to we
[1:51:37] have received the
[1:51:39] word it's ready for the Dynamics to set
[1:51:43] it a fire with the Holy Ghost fear not
[1:51:46] little flock it's your father's Good
[1:51:47] Will to give you the kingdom the Holy
[1:51:50] Ghost will strike a little church
[1:51:53] that's come out from the world women
[1:51:55] that wears long hair Nazarite to prove
[1:51:57] they're separated themselves from the
[1:52:01] world you say what can we
[1:52:03] expect what do we expect well I want you
[1:52:07] to hear the prophet's word and from the
[1:52:09] token I'm looking for a Break Forth of
[1:52:13] the spirit of
[1:52:15] God in these last days that we're now
[1:52:17] living for another surge of the holy
[1:52:20] spirit in the church for a rapture in
[1:52:22] faith just before it comes and
[1:52:24] everything is setting straight in order
[1:52:26] for that and I believe we're at the time
[1:52:29] that the word should have preeminence I
[1:52:31] believe the time to lay aside our Creeds
[1:52:34] our thoughts and come back to the
[1:52:37] word hallelujah a people coming back
[1:52:40] recognizing the Messiah United with the
[1:52:43] word having the full gasoline power amen
[1:52:47] the Thousand octane power of the Holy
[1:52:50] Ghost word in you to be lit by the
[1:52:54] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost for another
[1:52:56] surge of the Holy Ghost how many's ready
[1:52:59] for
[1:53:00] that Amen in the indictment he says may
[1:53:03] there come a Revival of the just and a
[1:53:06] great power come among the church just
[1:53:09] before it's going and he says let me
[1:53:13] read it again May there come forth a
[1:53:16] Revival of the just and a great power
[1:53:21] come among the church
[1:53:23] just before it's
[1:53:25] going and it's not hard to pray that
[1:53:29] because you promised
[1:53:32] it and we're looking Lord for that third
[1:53:35] pull that we know that's in our that we
[1:53:38] know that will do great things for us in
[1:53:40] our
[1:53:42] midst amen we know by now what the third
[1:53:46] pull is it's the opening of the word
[1:53:47] it's the revealing of those
[1:53:49] seals amen and but but friends many
[1:53:54] people have received what they call uh
[1:53:56] the opening of the word and they're
[1:53:57] still dead in
[1:53:59] sins still chained with unbelief still
[1:54:02] haven't come out so he says what we need
[1:54:06] today is an opening of the word that
[1:54:16] lives oh we're talking about a living
[1:54:19] bride in the Finish pull
[1:54:23] now she's a word bride she's in his very
[1:54:27] image she has to fit
[1:54:31] him the Capstone is Christ and the
[1:54:35] living bride must be exactly like him
[1:54:38] they must fit
[1:54:40] together and this this is is coming in
[1:54:43] Bride form now we can go through it and
[1:54:46] maybe we will before this sermon is over
[1:54:49] it depends on whether you drag me to
[1:54:52] death this morning but nevertheless you
[1:54:54] know I mean I'm I'm pressing through
[1:54:57] because of physically you know I I'm
[1:55:01] handicapped with my with my throat my
[1:55:03] voice but I want you to get this this
[1:55:06] morning so enter in with me pull like
[1:55:08] you never pulled before as I say it many
[1:55:11] times help me
[1:55:15] preach are you
[1:55:18] ready all right so his coming today is
[1:55:22] in Bride
[1:55:24] form he has to come in Bride
[1:55:28] form in order for him to come
[1:55:32] back cuz he's coming for a wife a bride
[1:55:36] who had made herself
[1:55:39] ready are you with me so his coming has
[1:55:43] to be manifested you said but we got the
[1:55:46] word brother Tim he's the Messiah and
[1:55:48] he's come in word form but oh wait a
[1:55:52] minute
[1:55:54] yeah Paul's Paul come along to them down
[1:55:58] there and said okay here's the Christ
[1:56:01] but you got to get more than the word
[1:56:04] you got to get the spirit have you
[1:56:05] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:56:08] believed are you with me amen so you see
[1:56:12] his coming was it comes in word form
[1:56:16] first one of the questions asked me in
[1:56:19] California why do we need a prophet
[1:56:23] that's a good
[1:56:24] question why did we need one because
[1:56:28] we've had thousands of years of
[1:56:31] misconstrued
[1:56:34] ideas and yet we were given a Bible like
[1:56:38] giving a road map but we didn't know
[1:56:41] where we
[1:56:42] were we didn't know what we were to do
[1:56:45] we didn't know what age we were
[1:56:48] in it took a SE to come in here and
[1:56:50] point in the scripture and said here's
[1:56:52] where you are this is the age that
[1:56:55] you're in this is what's happening your
[1:56:59] age to bring us back to the journey and
[1:57:03] say we've come all the way from the
[1:57:06] original Pentecost is a seed buried in
[1:57:08] the ground come up like a plant and what
[1:57:11] stage are we in we're back to grain
[1:57:15] again you see we had a
[1:57:18] message but I want you to remember his
[1:57:20] message is a message of
[1:57:24] Resurrection I'm not dead but I'm
[1:57:27] alive and the bride must have that same
[1:57:31] message it must be that same Easter
[1:57:34] message a resurrection message we're not
[1:57:37] a dead people that's right but we are
[1:57:40] alive and we'll never go back to the
[1:57:43] tombs of religion again that's right
[1:57:45] we'll never be yolked with Creeds and
[1:57:49] dogmas sealed up in some tomb somewhere
[1:57:53] never
[1:57:54] again never again that that reminds me
[1:57:57] of Israel they're over there they say
[1:58:00] never again never again will there be
[1:58:02] another Holocaust never
[1:58:06] again never again will We Stand By and
[1:58:09] let people go our people go down into
[1:58:11] furnaces and die in a holocaust and
[1:58:14] murdered and slaughtered never
[1:58:17] again we'll rise up an army we'll become
[1:58:21] a Nation we'll have a we'll have power
[1:58:26] amen we'll we'll be a formidable weapon
[1:58:28] and you touch one of our people we're
[1:58:31] coming after
[1:58:33] you the bride's got to be the same
[1:58:37] way amen never again never again never
[1:58:43] never never go back to where the Holy
[1:58:45] Ghost can't move never never again where
[1:58:48] the shout of the king is not in our
[1:58:49] midst never never again where the
[1:58:52] freedom of the spirit isn't that we
[1:58:53] can't dance in the spirit never never
[1:58:56] again will we have it amen where the
[1:58:58] power of God can't move in the house of
[1:59:02] God never
[1:59:04] [Applause]
[1:59:09] again so his coming must be in bright
[1:59:15] form and
[1:59:17] this I'm going to describe to you and
[1:59:20] I've done this before
[1:59:22] but well bear with me for a
[1:59:24] minute but I'm going to describe for
[1:59:28] you the
[1:59:30] church that brother brandham dreamed
[1:59:35] of one that was fundamentally with the
[1:59:39] word and had the faith and the Dynamics
[1:59:42] to go with
[1:59:43] it that's what he dreamed of brother
[1:59:46] brandham did not dream of intellectual
[1:59:50] speaking brother Bram did not dream of a
[1:59:53] church that would have to rely on
[1:59:55] psychology to solve the church's
[2:00:00] problems take young boys and put them
[2:00:02] through seven steps or seven weeks of of
[2:00:06] training on how not to look at
[2:00:08] pornography you don't need any training
[2:00:10] like that you need the Holy Ghost you
[2:00:12] get him on the inside of you he changes
[2:00:14] your
[2:00:17] nature right then and there that's all
[2:00:20] you need amen is a Divine
[2:00:25] vaccine oh no I shouldn't say that word
[2:00:28] I got censored the other day and took
[2:00:30] our sermon off of YouTube on account of
[2:00:32] it but nevertheless you see his coming
[2:00:37] today is more than
[2:00:41] word it's more than a
[2:00:44] message but it's now the word made
[2:00:50] flesh see that's what we didn't
[2:00:53] understand we started out many many
[2:00:55] years
[2:00:56] ago we thought my goodness we received
[2:00:59] the message God had sent a prophet he
[2:01:03] had Vindicated that we had the message
[2:01:05] we're ready to go home we
[2:01:09] weren't we didn't realize there was
[2:01:12] something different cuz God wasn't going
[2:01:14] to Rapture a bunch of
[2:01:18] tapes come on he wasn't going to take a
[2:01:21] bunch of books to Heaven that's right he
[2:01:23] wasn't going to take pictures of the
[2:01:27] prophet and pictures of a pillar of fire
[2:01:30] pictures of a man who had a pillar of
[2:01:32] fire his chance would have the pillar of
[2:01:41] fire amen and so we did not understand
[2:01:45] so we thought glory to God we're ready
[2:01:47] for the rapture we weren't right that's
[2:01:50] right the word we had received had to
[2:01:53] take on flesh that's
[2:01:55] right somebody had to take the book and
[2:01:58] eat it and once they ate it keep it down
[2:02:01] and digest it and once they digest it
[2:02:04] speak it and become the final
[2:02:08] [Applause]
[2:02:12] voice so this is his coming his coming
[2:02:16] is in bright form so while I went to
[2:02:19] meeting in there we're going to get it
[2:02:22] but only if you
[2:02:25] become Christ in bright
[2:02:29] form so you see there was a church
[2:02:32] brother brandom dreamed this was his
[2:02:35] dream
[2:02:36] Church the one he wanted to present to
[2:02:41] Christ like Paul would in his age and
[2:02:44] say I would present you as a Chase
[2:02:48] virgin this is the kind of church
[2:02:52] Paul would say of his I fear lest by any
[2:02:55] mean the serpent would begal you as he
[2:02:57] begal Eve take your virginity away you
[2:03:01] just become a harlot and it did it
[2:03:04] became the horror in the Book of
[2:03:09] Revelation but you know we're in danger
[2:03:11] of doing the same
[2:03:12] thing because you see every movement
[2:03:16] winds up
[2:03:18] organizing come on taking on a denom
[2:03:21] ational spirit and when they do they
[2:03:24] become a daughter to the hor called
[2:03:25] harlots and they're as guilty as their
[2:03:29] mother so now his what he dreamed of
[2:03:33] having was one that was fundamentally
[2:03:37] with the word and had the faith and
[2:03:40] Dynamics to go with
[2:03:43] it so he said in my travels I find two
[2:03:47] classes of people now I'm finding one
[2:03:50] like this and one like this one of them
[2:03:54] is fundamentals positionally they know
[2:03:57] by the mechanics that they are to be
[2:04:00] sons and daughters in
[2:04:03] God so one of them Knows by the word
[2:04:08] mechanically they know the mechanics
[2:04:10] they know what the Bible said it
[2:04:12] positions
[2:04:14] them now I'll tell you what they get so
[2:04:18] strongly
[2:04:20] positioned and root rooted in that
[2:04:23] fundamental part that Christ saves and
[2:04:26] he saved me from my sins I'll tell you
[2:04:29] how rooted they
[2:04:32] are I spoke with a man who was a Baptist
[2:04:36] man and he said brother Tim I would like
[2:04:39] to talk with you today I need a little
[2:04:42] advice I said
[2:04:44] okay he lights one cigarette off of
[2:04:47] another while we're sitting there
[2:04:49] talking I mean take literally takes that
[2:04:52] one that's lit down to the stub and
[2:04:54] sucks on it and starts
[2:04:56] another he says now I am a
[2:05:01] Christian and he says I have made my
[2:05:05] confession you know I'm Baptist I've
[2:05:07] made my confession in Christ I have been
[2:05:10] saved I believe right now if the Lord
[2:05:15] would
[2:05:16] come I would just be changed in a moment
[2:05:21] and I'd meet the Lord in the air it'd be
[2:05:24] a wonderful thing and here just 3 weeks
[2:05:29] before I knew that he had been arrested
[2:05:32] for drunk
[2:05:34] driving and that he was now asking me a
[2:05:38] question about being married for the
[2:05:40] third time to somebody else's
[2:05:44] wife but he was so sure listen they had
[2:05:49] taken the words of the Bible and it so
[2:05:53] put placed him
[2:05:56] fundamentally until he was so sure that
[2:06:00] I'm a Son of God didn't matter what kind
[2:06:03] of sin he was living in he was a child
[2:06:06] of the Living God and going to heaven
[2:06:07] would go in the Rapture if he come this
[2:06:12] moment now I'll tell you what there's
[2:06:15] some of you that don't have that kind of
[2:06:19] assurance and you're now not even living
[2:06:21] kind of
[2:06:22] life but you know you're doubting you're
[2:06:25] quibbling you're wondering you're you
[2:06:27] know back and forth and up and down this
[2:06:28] man had been so placed in the word I'm
[2:06:32] saved I have been baptized I've joined
[2:06:35] the church I've I've received Christ as
[2:06:37] my savior I made my profession of faith
[2:06:40] and I'm going to
[2:06:42] heaven
[2:06:46] fundamentally of course he had no
[2:06:50] Dynamics to make him live
[2:06:54] it so he had no power over his tobacco
[2:06:57] his
[2:06:58] drunkenness his
[2:07:00] womanizing but he was going to
[2:07:03] heaven now so you see one by they're
[2:07:09] fundamentalist they positionally know by
[2:07:11] the mechanics that they are to be Sons
[2:07:14] and Daughters of God now you know we do
[2:07:16] the same thing we place you what do we
[2:07:18] do we place you and we say you were
[2:07:20] chosen
[2:07:22] before the foundation of the world if
[2:07:25] there's one going to be in that Rapture
[2:07:27] you're going to be that
[2:07:30] one and the job of the ministry is to so
[2:07:34] fundamentally place you in the word to
[2:07:37] give you an
[2:07:39] assurance your sins are
[2:07:41] forgiven your past is over that you're a
[2:07:45] child of the Living
[2:07:48] God but friends it takes more than
[2:07:51] belonging to a message church and being
[2:07:53] told you were chosen before the
[2:07:55] foundation of the world you got to have
[2:07:58] the Dynamics to go with it you got to
[2:08:00] have the real true genuine Revelation
[2:08:03] from God I am God's son that's right
[2:08:07] that's
[2:08:08] right now he said
[2:08:11] so the next I find is the
[2:08:15] Pentecostals day with the baptism of the
[2:08:17] Holy Spirit but I said the
[2:08:19] fundamentalist Fundamentalist
[2:08:21] positionally know where they are at but
[2:08:24] they don't have any faith in the word so
[2:08:27] there's no power to go with it the
[2:08:28] Pentecostal has got a lot of faith but
[2:08:30] they don't know who they
[2:08:33] are so you got one that positionally
[2:08:36] don't know who they are don't realize
[2:08:39] what comes with their sunship yet they
[2:08:42] got a lot of faith they'll go out and
[2:08:44] pray for the sick and it
[2:08:46] happens see Miracles take place and
[2:08:49] everything else but they don't know POS
[2:08:51] positionally in the word what God's
[2:08:53] doing in this hour but he said it's like
[2:08:56] a man that has money in the bank but
[2:08:59] could not write a check and one who
[2:09:01] could write a check but had no money in
[2:09:03] the bank if you could just get them two
[2:09:05] together now this is Brother Brandon's
[2:09:07] dream Church to have them both
[2:09:13] together
[2:09:16] no so he was talking to a man
[2:09:19] about you know
[2:09:22] about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:09:24] about the Pentecostal Believers and the
[2:09:27] man said well what makes him act like
[2:09:29] that it's letting off the
[2:09:30] steam I don't think it have to be
[2:09:32] necessary but they got to give vent
[2:09:34] somewhere now they would just take all
[2:09:36] that Steam and could know how to direct
[2:09:38] it fundamentally in the word the big
[2:09:40] regime of God would start to move it
[2:09:43] on come on
[2:09:45] now now that's like some of you will
[2:09:47] dance in the spirit and the next day
[2:09:49] doubt your salvation
[2:09:54] don't hang up on me I'm still
[2:09:56] preaching amen but but again you know if
[2:09:59] you take that Steam and put it in the
[2:10:02] word and say I know who I have believed
[2:10:06] I know that I am called I know I'm the
[2:10:10] Bride of this age and Satan cannot stand
[2:10:13] before me I'm a child of the most high
[2:10:17] God you got to have faith in your
[2:10:19] position
[2:10:21] but he said that's where Satan got in it
[2:10:24] to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics
[2:10:29] or back all Dynamics and no
[2:10:32] mechanics see we got to put it together
[2:10:36] we got to get the power of the Holy
[2:10:38] Spirit but we got to come back with the
[2:10:40] word to feed the machine we can't feed
[2:10:44] it on Creed it won't burn it chokes up
[2:10:46] the flu it will not burn it it was made
[2:10:49] for the word of God man shall not live
[2:10:52] by bread alone but by every word not
[2:10:53] just part of it every word that proceeds
[2:10:55] out of the mouth of
[2:10:58] God
[2:11:00] so this is Brother brandom's dream
[2:11:03] church and I just want to
[2:11:06] say as a
[2:11:08] veteran that for these past 60 years
[2:11:11] we've got the mechanics
[2:11:13] down the first principles the core
[2:11:17] doctrines
[2:11:19] predestination ET
[2:11:22] security the original sin all these
[2:11:25] mystery truths buddy we we've expounded
[2:11:28] the shields the Thunders the trumpets
[2:11:31] the
[2:11:32] vials but by and large we have neglected
[2:11:36] the
[2:11:38] Dynamics
[2:11:40] now listen I I'm not trying to paint
[2:11:43] with a broad
[2:11:44] brush so don't paint yourself in there
[2:11:47] if that's not
[2:11:49] you but I'm just saying as a whole the
[2:11:53] message movement has neglected the
[2:11:57] Dynamics just like you said and I've
[2:11:59] quoted it often God of this evil age
[2:12:01] instead of tearing for the baptism of
[2:12:03] the Holy Ghost let science prove to her
[2:12:06] that the Holy Ghost was only for the
[2:12:09] disciples instead of keeping Divine
[2:12:11] Healing going when she ought to be now
[2:12:13] raised from the dead doing great
[2:12:15] Miracles she has let Satan under his
[2:12:18] leadership a religious man take the word
[2:12:20] of God and try to say it was for another
[2:12:22] age you say they're not doing that
[2:12:24] brother oh yeah it was for the Divine
[2:12:26] Healing move that was only back for them
[2:12:28] and that's not now we got the word now
[2:12:30] we're we come to Perfection we don't
[2:12:32] need that
[2:12:36] anymore and she's believed it and the
[2:12:39] Bible said the things that I do you
[2:12:41] shall do also he said go into all the
[2:12:43] world and preach the gospel to every
[2:12:45] creature we're still creatures these
[2:12:47] signs should follow every one of them
[2:12:49] that believe she denied every bitt it
[2:12:51] she denies all the supernatural she's
[2:12:54] swapped it for his intellectual
[2:12:57] conception of the
[2:13:00] Bible and this is
[2:13:02] happening and let me just tell you
[2:13:05] that's just not my
[2:13:07] assessment that's the prophet's
[2:13:11] assessment let me read from uh from the
[2:13:14] rising of the sun he said you say the
[2:13:16] power is in the gasoline brother brandom
[2:13:19] and I want you to remember the gasoline
[2:13:20] rep represents the word the power is in
[2:13:22] the word brother Brandon you see that's
[2:13:24] what we hear all the time the word the
[2:13:26] word the word the word the
[2:13:28] word and he said but I don't have care
[2:13:31] how much power is in the gasoline unless
[2:13:35] there is a
[2:13:36] spot there to manifest that power unless
[2:13:40] there's a power there to confirm that
[2:13:41] that's gasoline it might as well be
[2:13:46] water J you so we got the word brother
[2:13:49] Tim we got it I tell you we we know it
[2:13:52] we got to know it back and forth and
[2:13:53] whatever but if you don't have the
[2:13:55] spark if there ain't something igniting
[2:13:58] that word if ain't some something that
[2:14:01] is bringing to life that word and you're
[2:14:04] filled with the Holy Ghost you're ined
[2:14:07] with power from on high you've got God
[2:14:10] living in your life you have overcoming
[2:14:12] power even ain't
[2:14:15] there your word might as well be water
[2:14:24] no matter how much you theologians claim
[2:14:27] how well you got your church set brother
[2:14:30] we do our church orders and everything
[2:14:32] how much education you got and we've
[2:14:34] educated people how much like the Bible
[2:14:38] until that wave sheath until the Holy
[2:14:40] Spirit comes on that person to Quicken
[2:14:42] that word the gasoline represents the
[2:14:45] word is the truth but without the spirit
[2:14:47] it won't
[2:14:49] move that's right
[2:14:52] and here's where he here's where he
[2:14:54] stresses it now so this ain't me we have
[2:14:58] put too much stress on the
[2:15:07] mechanics let that sink
[2:15:09] in we have put too much stress on the
[2:15:14] mechanics and nothing on the Dynamics
[2:15:21] it needs the dynamic power of God the
[2:15:24] resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon
[2:15:27] the church to manifest and bring to pass
[2:15:29] that this is gasoline it might be in a
[2:15:32] gasoline
[2:15:34] can but it can still be water but the
[2:15:38] only proof of it is put this life on it
[2:15:41] and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or
[2:15:43] not so if you want to know if it's
[2:15:45] really word is it Healing The Sick is it
[2:15:49] casting out devils
[2:15:51] amen is it filling people with the Holy
[2:15:53] Ghost is the power of God living in the
[2:15:56] church giving overcoming lives somebody
[2:15:58] help me preach amen if if not if not I I
[2:16:03] tell you what put the spirit on it and
[2:16:05] you'll find out that's right if it just
[2:16:07] SPS around and says days of Miracles are
[2:16:10] passed or this only happened when the
[2:16:12] prophet was here you got water you got
[2:16:15] water in your
[2:16:18] tank now the Pentecostals had a lot of
[2:16:20] faith
[2:16:22] but didn't know who they
[2:16:24] were they lacked the full the full gas
[2:16:28] of the word they yet they have true
[2:16:31] Visions I'm talking about true Visions
[2:16:34] true
[2:16:35] tongues yeah true prophecies true
[2:16:40] Miracles there were great
[2:16:43] men Godly men men like John G Lake from
[2:16:48] South Africa or that's where he had his
[2:16:51] Ministry men of Faith men of power like
[2:16:54] Smith
[2:16:55] Wigglesworth like Daddy Bosworth Godly
[2:17:00] men men with
[2:17:05] faith I mean Daddy Bosworth would bring
[2:17:08] people in a prayer line with without a
[2:17:11] gift when I say without a gift I'm
[2:17:13] talking about some manifestation in his
[2:17:15] hand or
[2:17:17] discernment and would stand there and
[2:17:19] just preach the word in such a way way
[2:17:21] and then have some somebody come up and
[2:17:23] he would rebuke a death spirit and
[2:17:25] somebody's he said it's one of the
[2:17:26] easiest spirits to make turn
[2:17:34] loose men of power led by the spirit men
[2:17:37] of
[2:17:41] Faith but
[2:17:43] now lacking the fundamentals listen the
[2:17:48] word to come so they they had lot of
[2:17:54] spark but they were missing the
[2:17:56] word watch now I you know last week on
[2:18:01] our trip to
[2:18:03] California our brother Jonathan sorus
[2:18:07] he took us to Angeles
[2:18:10] Temple where Amy simple M ferson built
[2:18:16] America's first mega
[2:18:19] church that would set over 5,300
[2:18:24] people and during those days it was
[2:18:28] jam-packed and she would die in
[2:18:30] 1944 at the age of about 52 or
[2:18:34] three and of
[2:18:36] course she spread the message of
[2:18:39] Pentecost to the world she owned the
[2:18:42] first big radio station which was
[2:18:46] kfg that broadcaster Services as far
[2:18:49] away as austral
[2:18:51] now that was a powerful gun big gun
[2:18:55] radio that had that kind of broadcast
[2:18:58] would reach Australia I don't know what
[2:19:00] their rules were in that day but
[2:19:02] apparently they didn't have
[2:19:05] any and the spread the isusa message
[2:19:09] around the
[2:19:12] world this right here is the opening to
[2:19:16] the parsonage of her home right here on
[2:19:18] the big complex
[2:19:21] I stood behind the pulpit where she
[2:19:23] preached while I was there it's a
[2:19:26] beautiful Pulpit it's was hand carved by
[2:19:32] Gypsies and was a gift to
[2:19:36] her and behind that desk there were men
[2:19:41] of Faith Like Smith
[2:19:43] Wigglesworth preach behind that very
[2:19:48] desk and where brother Ram preached the
[2:19:52] isua Jubilee and the lamb and the Dove
[2:19:55] and plus the he had sermons that he
[2:19:57] preached there that wasn't even in
[2:19:59] recorded we don't even have tapes of
[2:20:01] them but he talks about having been
[2:20:03] there and and there you know in there
[2:20:07] brother brandham well you know even
[2:20:09] spoke of this himself and uh you know he
[2:20:12] says you know they they've shown me
[2:20:15] around and he said I've seen on it we
[2:20:17] would see Jesus and it's their carv in
[2:20:21] the wood right there he said this is
[2:20:22] mighty nice so he's standing behind this
[2:20:26] very
[2:20:27] desk and he's preaching the isua Jubilee
[2:20:31] of 50 years since the outpouring of the
[2:20:34] Holy Spirit on isua
[2:20:37] street they have a commemoration and
[2:20:40] brother bram's one of the
[2:20:41] speakers I stood behind this desk and I
[2:20:45] thought about the men of God Mighty
[2:20:49] Men even going in that woman that woman
[2:20:53] being a oh yeah maybe she's doing God's
[2:20:55] service without his will I you know I'm
[2:20:59] I'm not the judge of all of that of why
[2:21:00] and where and how
[2:21:02] come but let me just tell you I mean you
[2:21:05] know there were the things there on
[2:21:07] displays of braces and shoes from people
[2:21:11] with INF infantile paralysis and braces
[2:21:14] that was removed and all kinds of
[2:21:16] crutches and things that was there
[2:21:18] paraphernalia people that were
[2:21:21] healed as this woman ministered to them
[2:21:24] and laid hands on them because of
[2:21:30] Faith so well that was
[2:21:35] Pentecost that was the zeusa street
[2:21:37] brother
[2:21:38] Tim I'm just saying if they're the
[2:21:42] Shu and they're the
[2:21:44] twin what ought we to be like
[2:21:51] yes here they were with the word they
[2:21:54] [Music]
[2:21:56] knew and they had Faith to believe in it
[2:22:00] to make that part of the word
[2:22:04] work now I just read you what brother
[2:22:07] brand something we ought to be
[2:22:09] doing but here here this woman and God
[2:22:13] would would honor This Woman's
[2:22:17] prayer that ain't all that ain't all
[2:22:22] you know I we all we know all know of
[2:22:25] Tommy
[2:22:27] osbor we've heard of him many times of
[2:22:30] brother Bradon speaking about him Tommy
[2:22:32] osbor his great faith healing you know
[2:22:35] he had a sister that prayed for the sick
[2:22:38] too and she would have a boy come in her
[2:22:40] prayer line that had a cold his mom said
[2:22:44] to him said go up and have her pray for
[2:22:45] you CU she had a prayer line she'
[2:22:48] preached and then she had a prayer line
[2:22:50] has happened in the Assembly of God
[2:22:53] Church as she has this prayer line and
[2:22:57] prays for this boy says Sun boy um what

[2:23:15] prayed for him what she did what the boy
[2:23:17] didn't tell her is that he had had his
[2:23:21] eye knocked out and taken out because of
[2:23:23] an infection when he was a a young boy
[2:23:27] and had no

[2:24:13] of stuff that he would read off of a
[2:24:16] card while his eyes bandaged up Way Big
[2:24:20] you know what it's impossible and
[2:24:21] doctors examine him and make the
[2:24:23] decision this boy can see without an
[2:24:29] eyeball what
[2:24:31] happened a woman's
[2:24:33] prayer not trying to knock down you
[2:24:35] ladies I'm telling you I'm trying to
[2:24:37] tell you God will even hear your
[2:24:41] prayer but somebody that will
[2:24:44] believe are you with
[2:24:47] me listen
[2:24:50] we walked into the
[2:24:52] auditorium looked into there 5,300 seat
[2:24:55] it was the first mega church in
[2:25:00] America message went out around the
[2:25:03] world to bringing the Pentecostal isusa
[2:25:06] Street
[2:25:07] message all the way
[2:25:09] down and then a couple of blocks from
[2:25:12] there we drove by when able to tour it
[2:25:15] but we got just a couple of blocks later
[2:25:17] we went to the Bonnie Bray House and in
[2:25:20] Los Angeles and this little humble house
[2:25:24] was where the holy ghost first fell on
[2:25:27] the west coast out
[2:25:29] there they were D in Los
[2:25:32] Angeles just just a few blocks away from
[2:25:36] Angeles Temple now back in
[2:25:40] 1906 and in this place so many crowded
[2:25:43] in there until the ports fell in and
[2:25:48] then they mve the meetings to the USA
[2:25:51] Street and that building onusa Street
[2:25:53] burned with in in a fire so I can't show
[2:25:55] you the picture of that it wasn't there
[2:25:58] but the Holy Ghost experience began
[2:26:00] earlier than 1906 for about
[2:26:04] 1903 two or three there was Charles
[2:26:06] parum in his Bible School in Kansas he'd
[2:26:10] experiened an outbreak of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:13] with speaking in other
[2:26:15] tongues brother William Seymour was a
[2:26:18] student of Charles parum
[2:26:21] brother Seymour moved to be the pastor
[2:26:25] in in LA and he began to teach about the
[2:26:30] coming of the Holy Ghost and how that he
[2:26:33] believed it was a restoration hour and
[2:26:36] how that acts 2 and 4 and the spirit
[2:26:40] fell and their
[2:26:43] expectations of the Holy Ghost to
[2:26:48] fall and they got under the conviction
[2:26:50] of that word and there there they they
[2:26:55] began as he began to preach and teaching
[2:26:58] on the Holy Ghost they rejected him in
[2:27:02] his church and so he started a home
[2:27:04] meeting right here on Bonnie bra street
[2:27:07] in the asb's home a little black family
[2:27:10] he was a black man and the little black
[2:27:12] family had this home that was other
[2:27:14] black people across the
[2:27:17] street just before leaving for a prayer
[2:27:19] meeting on April the 9th
[2:27:23] 1906 Seymour's friend Edward Lee began
[2:27:27] to speak in tongues after Seymour had
[2:27:30] laid hands on him and prayed for him
[2:27:32] well they went from there a couple of
[2:27:34] blocks up the street to the Arbury home
[2:27:36] with Bonnie Bray at 7:30 p.m. prayer
[2:27:39] meeting and there was a handful of
[2:27:41] africanamerican saints gathered together
[2:27:44] that wanted encounter with God in a
[2:27:46] greater Manner and they had a song and a
[2:27:49] few prayers and several testimonies
[2:27:51] released and testimony was shared of how
[2:27:54] that Lee had spoken tongue just two
[2:27:56] hours before and then he began to re
[2:27:59] preach from Acts 2 and 4 when the day of
[2:28:01] Pentecost was fully come suddenly there
[2:28:04] came a sound of of a mighty rushing wind
[2:28:07] and and and the pillar of fire come in
[2:28:10] and and then something happened that
[2:28:13] they'd all been waiting long for God
[2:28:15] crashed into that
[2:28:17] meeting like never before and somebody
[2:28:20] began to speak in tongues and several
[2:28:22] began to be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[2:28:24] and spoke in tongues there was a little
[2:28:27] girl from across the street who was a
[2:28:30] cousin to the Asberry her name was jeie
[2:28:33] Moore she lived across the street she
[2:28:36] was resting on a stool when suddenly she
[2:28:39] fell to the ground and began to speak in
[2:28:41] tongues she's known now as the first
[2:28:44] woman of the LA to to speak in tongues
[2:28:46] during this time she recalled it was
[2:28:49] like a vessel broke inside of her and
[2:28:51] water surged through her entire being
[2:28:54] when this rust came to her lips she
[2:28:56] spoke in six different languages that
[2:28:59] she'd seen earlier in a vision these
[2:29:01] tongues were interpreted into English
[2:29:04] following this release Genie who had
[2:29:06] never played a piano before walked over
[2:29:10] to the piano and played it under the
[2:29:11] anointing while singing in other
[2:29:15] tongues and yeah Satan got in there
[2:29:21] yes he
[2:29:23] did but just
[2:29:26] because Satan got in there I'm asking
[2:29:30] you are we going to keep God
[2:29:32] out because we're afraid Satan might get
[2:29:41] in I just tell you don't throw the baby
[2:29:44] out with the bath
[2:29:45] water in other words don't don't discard
[2:29:49] something that's valuable getting ready
[2:29:51] is something that's
[2:29:53] unwanted why bind the Holy Spirit and
[2:29:55] not let him work because we're afraid of
[2:29:59] what the devil might
[2:30:00] do can you imagine there's men today
[2:30:03] that will not testify the miraculous
[2:30:05] power of God because of what they saw in
[2:30:08] Pentecost when men would take that and
[2:30:11] and bring glory to themselves and so for
[2:30:14] that reason they will not testify of the
[2:30:16] glory of God I'll tell you the Bible
[2:30:18] said to declare his Mighty
[2:30:21] works let the generations know that's
[2:30:26] Amen Let Let our children know there's a
[2:30:29] real God there's a living
[2:30:31] God that's right so oh we dare not tell
[2:30:34] of the Miracles in this church I tell
[2:30:37] you we dare we dare not refuse to tell
[2:30:41] we will tell amen we will tell the
[2:30:44] stories we will declare he heals cancer
[2:30:48] we will declare he heals alpia we
[2:30:51] declare that he heals oure diseases we
[2:30:54] will declare he's the same yesterday
[2:30:57] today and forever that crippled boys can
[2:31:00] walk amen that blind eyes can
[2:31:03] [Applause]
[2:31:07] see why bind the Holy Spirit not allow
[2:31:10] him work because of fear what the
[2:31:11] devil's going to
[2:31:15] do don't be a to see you and reject
[2:31:19] Christ who's knocking at your door and
[2:31:22] not allowing him in with
[2:31:24] Pentecost just because Satan also
[2:31:33] knocks don't reject the voice of God
[2:31:36] because Satan has a
[2:31:38] voice but let me go on with
[2:31:41] this we had a long day
[2:31:44] today and I'm not going to make it easy
[2:31:50] so yes as I quote the prophet in it was
[2:31:54] a mixture of the unrighteous partaking
[2:31:58] of spiritual blessings and manifesting
[2:32:01] in the Holy
[2:32:04] Ghost let me read that again so yes in
[2:32:08] it was a mixture of the unrighteous
[2:32:12] partaking of spiritual blessings and
[2:32:14] manifesting in the Holy Ghost in it also
[2:32:17] was devil power as me were under the
[2:32:20] control of devils yet no one seemed to
[2:32:23] realize it and then to prove it was not
[2:32:27] real it was not the real now listen it
[2:32:31] was not the
[2:32:32] grain nor the complete
[2:32:35] restoration but it was a continuation of
[2:32:40] reformation and these people he said
[2:32:42] before the second generation had
[2:32:44] appeared organized and wrote their
[2:32:46] unscriptural doctrines and built their
[2:32:48] own fences as ever other group ahead of
[2:32:50] them did they just become another
[2:32:52] denomination another daughter of the
[2:32:55] what did they
[2:32:58] lack they had
[2:33:01] faith and they demonstrated
[2:33:03] power but not the word because the book
[2:33:07] was not
[2:33:10] open but I want to introduce to you
[2:33:13] today that there is a real
[2:33:16] bride who has both word and Power
[2:33:21] amen listen brother Brandon said what
[2:33:23] seemed to be the answer came as many
[2:33:25] begin to speak in tongue manifest gifts
[2:33:27] of the Spirit and then it believed it
[2:33:30] was then believed this was indeed the
[2:33:32] long way to Restoration it was
[2:33:36] not for the latter rain can come only
[2:33:38] after the former rain which is the
[2:33:40] spring or teaching rain and the latter
[2:33:42] rain then the the lattering then is a
[2:33:45] harvest rain how could it be the real
[2:33:47] thing when the teaching rain had not
[2:33:49] come the prophet messenger who was sent
[2:33:52] to teach the people and turn the hearts
[2:33:54] of the children back to the Pentecostal
[2:33:56] fathers had not yet come thus what was
[2:33:59] thought to be the restoration and the
[2:34:01] final quicking of the Rapture had not
[2:34:07] come but we do we know who we are and we
[2:34:12] know whose we are and we know the
[2:34:15] mechanics better than any other age
[2:34:20] we know correct water
[2:34:22] baptism we know godhead we know serpent
[2:34:25] seed we understand the symbols in the
[2:34:28] Book of Revelation we know because the
[2:34:31] Silence has been broken we have received
[2:34:34] the prophet messenger who was sent to
[2:34:36] teach the people and turn the hearts of
[2:34:39] the children back to the Pentecostal
[2:34:40] fathers and he has come and he's gone
[2:34:43] and he sounded his message and we
[2:34:46] received it and I want to say we have
[2:34:48] eaten it
[2:34:50] amen and it is sweet as
[2:34:52] honey thus the restoration and final
[2:34:56] quickening under Rapture has
[2:34:59] come we're no longer waiting on
[2:35:03] it now let me just make clear before I
[2:35:07] close this morning you can't go anywhere
[2:35:10] without the mechanics of the
[2:35:14] word we're not in any way trying to say
[2:35:17] we don't need the word
[2:35:20] like they say we don't need the
[2:35:23] spirit but we're saying we must have the
[2:35:26] word we must have all the word but we
[2:35:30] also must have the
[2:35:35] spirit
[2:35:37] because you can't run without it you see
[2:35:42] without the that gasoline of the word
[2:35:46] that has the power and let me just say
[2:35:48] this word has all the power in it even
[2:35:52] brother Brandon we talked about the
[2:35:53] third phase of his ministry which would
[2:35:55] be the opening of those Seven Seals of
[2:35:57] revealing of the Mysteries he showed
[2:35:59] first the power of
[2:36:01] it it would heal the
[2:36:04] sick it would create it would
[2:36:08] resurrect it would speak to storms and
[2:36:10] it would save your
[2:36:13] children that's the power that lays in
[2:36:15] this word hallelujah but it's got to
[2:36:18] have somebody
[2:36:20] with faith to believe it right Dynamics
[2:36:24] to come to the mechanics and make that
[2:36:25] word live amen Because unless there's a
[2:36:29] spark to manifest the power of the word
[2:36:32] it might as well be
[2:36:35] water and if you got gas and it's mixed
[2:36:38] with some
[2:36:39] water like the Dynamics comes on and is
[2:36:43] a sputters days of Miracles are pass age
[2:36:46] of the Apostles have cease all these
[2:36:49] things it don't happen like that in our
[2:36:51] day oh that was only for the prophet in
[2:36:53] his ministry it'll it'll hit that water
[2:36:55] and it'll just splutter and you'll go
[2:36:59] nowhere you just you know just make a
[2:37:02] noise but never never go forward you see
[2:37:06] again we're in the age where the true
[2:37:08] church returns to be and the bride she
[2:37:11] was at Pentecost so we know there must
[2:37:15] be a necessity a return of dynamic power
[2:37:20] because to have the
[2:37:22] 100% pure word without the spirit is
[2:37:25] like
[2:37:26] having 100% pure
[2:37:29] gasoline and no
[2:37:33] spark so now brother bram's dream and
[2:37:36] hopes of having a
[2:37:38] group it's going to be
[2:37:40] fulfilled his dream of having a
[2:37:43] church that had the faith that took the
[2:37:46] faith the Pentecostals demonstrated and
[2:37:49] the knowledge of the fundamentals who
[2:37:51] positionally know by the mechanics that
[2:37:54] they are to be Sons and Daughters of God
[2:37:56] getting Pentecostal faith into a people
[2:37:59] who positionally know by the word who
[2:38:02] they
[2:38:02] are let me ask you
[2:38:05] something we talk about the word that
[2:38:09] came what was the
[2:38:11] semblance you remember there in sabben
[2:38:16] Canyon as he had his hands lifted up
[2:38:18] praying
[2:38:19] about those seven angels going to come
[2:38:21] to him wondering it would be the end of
[2:38:23] his life and there was a sword came in
[2:38:26] his
[2:38:28] hand and was glistening in the
[2:38:31] Sun and he looked at it where in the
[2:38:34] world did this sword come from I'm miles
[2:38:38] away from
[2:38:39] civilization and here I had my hands up
[2:38:43] and this sword drops into my
[2:38:46] hand and the voice spoke to him and said
[2:38:49] said this is the King's
[2:38:53] sword it is that third
[2:38:57] pull oh he said a
[2:39:00] sword he said you use it to night men
[2:39:05] with now let me just say to you that's
[2:39:08] what we wanted to do with the sword is
[2:39:12] night men and make them
[2:39:16] rulers and this is a Joshua and this
[2:39:18] one's an Aaron and and we taking the
[2:39:20] word and nighted men and made Kings out
[2:39:22] of
[2:39:24] them amen but I want you to understand
[2:39:28] that's not why the sword was
[2:39:31] given the sword was given it's the
[2:39:36] word and it is given there to defeat
[2:39:39] your
[2:39:40] enemy Amen to put the two-edged sword in
[2:39:44] your hand said well brother Tim brother
[2:39:46] brandham got that that sword in his hand
[2:39:48] let me just tell you something Moses
[2:39:51] went up on the mountain and there was
[2:39:53] ten commandments put in his hands but
[2:39:56] that was not Moses Ten
[2:39:59] Commandments amen he was only
[2:40:01] representing all of Israel who was
[2:40:04] getting the word of God and when brother
[2:40:06] Brandon went into being a canyon there
[2:40:08] and received the king's sword he was not
[2:40:11] getting that for himself he was getting
[2:40:14] after for every member of the Bride
[2:40:17] where you would have a weapon against
[2:40:19] the enemy but it takes a hand of Faith
[2:40:22] to use
[2:40:23] it no matter how powerful it is you got
[2:40:26] to have a hand of Faith to use it the
[2:40:31] seven Thunders what were they given for
[2:40:34] just to give us more
[2:40:36] knowledge brother Brandon talks about
[2:40:38] him in the fourth
[2:40:39] seal we had him the Antichrist coming
[2:40:42] last night with his great sword to kill
[2:40:46] we find that he gets killed with the
[2:40:48] sword too the sword of the word God's
[2:40:51] word sharp two-edged sword slays him
[2:40:53] puts him right down wait until them
[2:40:56] seven Thunders utter their voices to
[2:40:59] that group who can really take the word
[2:41:00] of God and hand it there it'll slice
[2:41:03] it'll cut and they'll close the heavens
[2:41:05] they can shut this or do that whatever
[2:41:08] they want to Glory he'll be slayed by
[2:41:10] that word that proceeds from his mouth
[2:41:12] it's sharper than a two-edged sword she
[2:41:16] that's the
[2:41:17] bride she is a mouth of
[2:41:21] God wait a minute where does he hold the
[2:41:27] sword his sword was in his
[2:41:32] mouth and where would the word be in the
[2:41:36] bride in her mouth that's right
[2:41:40] Hallelujah I'm talking to a people this
[2:41:42] morning that's going to speak to their
[2:41:44] mountains I'm talking about a people
[2:41:46] who's going to demonstrate the power of
[2:41:48] the word I'm talking about a people who
[2:41:51] knows they're God and will do
[2:41:54] exploits hallelujah what an age we're
[2:41:57] living in
[2:41:58] church and to think you have been called
[2:42:01] to be the final voice to the final
[2:42:04] age to God to speak through a people
[2:42:08] like he's never spoke
[2:42:13] before let's stand our
[2:42:15] feet let the musicians come now
[2:42:24] I've labored along this
[2:42:27] morning I've done it with a bit of a
[2:42:30] horse throat all these ministers know
[2:42:33] when you have something like that to
[2:42:35] kind of holds you back it's harder to
[2:42:38] press
[2:42:39] through hard harder to to to yield to
[2:42:42] that vein of anointing but I hope the
[2:42:44] message got
[2:42:46] through amen I hope here is I've
[2:42:49] sacrificed and labored and came here
[2:42:52] maybe not at my best this morning but
[2:42:55] given my
[2:42:56] best I hope in return you're receiving
[2:42:59] the word and you're saying oh God let me
[2:43:01] become a voice to that word let it live
[2:43:04] out of my life let it change me in your
[2:43:06] presence
[2:43:09] Lord bow your head just for a
[2:43:12] moment play very
[2:43:17] softly maybe this
[2:43:22] morning you know a little bit about the
[2:43:25] message fundamentally you know this you
[2:43:27] know that but you know the overcoming
[2:43:30] power isn't in your
[2:43:32] life there's still sin there's still
[2:43:35] drinking they're still smoking maybe you
[2:43:38] even been baptized in his name maybe you
[2:43:41] hadn't really surrendered your
[2:43:43] life but this
[2:43:45] morning are you're here in this presence
[2:43:50] you want to make a full
[2:43:53] surrenderance to

[2:43:59] am don't let me Le from here the
[2:44:04] same I hear there's a
[2:44:07] power fundamentally I believe Lord I
[2:44:11] know it's
[2:44:12] true but I want that
[2:44:15] spark to come ignite the word within me
[2:44:18] and make make it
[2:44:20] live I want to be changed in your
[2:44:23] presence I want you to fill me with your
[2:44:25] presence Lord with your power would it
[2:44:28] be somebody raise their hand to God and
[2:44:29] say would you remember me brother Tim as
[2:44:31] you pray I don't want to go back the
[2:44:34] same God sees your hand he sees your
[2:44:38] hand you know you don't have to be in
[2:44:42] bondage you might been in the tombs of
[2:44:45] sin chained down by

[2:44:55] takes Jesus will break every

[2:45:07] woman a real child of God
[2:45:10] surrendered to his holy
[2:45:13] spirit just ask him to Lord that spark
