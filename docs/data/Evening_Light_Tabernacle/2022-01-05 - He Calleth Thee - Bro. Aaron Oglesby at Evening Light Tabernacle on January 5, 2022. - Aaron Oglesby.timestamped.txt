[41:32] portion of the book of mark
[41:40] amen didn't he good to us
[41:43] 1835 says and it came to pass that as
[41:47] he was coming nine to jericho a certain
[41:49] blind man set by the wayside begging
[41:52] and hearing the multitude pass by he
[41:54] asked what it meant
[41:55] and they told him that jesus of nazareth
[41:58] passeth by
[42:00] i believe he's passing by right now in
[42:02] this service
[42:05] and he cried saying jesus thou son of
[42:07] david
[42:08] have mercy on me
[42:11] and they which went before rebuked him
[42:14] that he should hold his peace but he
[42:16] cried so much the more
[42:18] thou son of david have mercy on me
[42:21] and jesus stood and commanded him to be
[42:24] brought unto him and when he was come
[42:26] near he asked him saying what wilt thou
[42:29] that i should do unto thee
[42:32] and he said lord that i may receive my
[42:34] sight
[42:36] and jesus said unto him receive thy
[42:37] sight thy faith hath saved thee
[42:40] and immediately he received his sight
[42:42] and followed him glorifying god
[42:45] and all the people when they saw it gave
[42:47] praise
[42:48] unto god
[42:50] amen amen if you'll look with me also in
[42:52] mark 10
[42:53] verse 46 10 and 46.
[42:59] and we're reading
[43:01] the same story
[43:03] from a different account
[43:05] it says in
[43:06] and they came to jericho
[43:08] and as he went out of jericho with his
[43:10] disciples and a great number of people
[43:12] blind bartimaeus the son of timmius set
[43:14] by the highway side begging
[43:16] and when he heard that it was jesus of
[43:18] nazareth he began to cry out and say
[43:20] jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
[43:24] and many charged him that he should hold
[43:26] his peace but he cried the more a great
[43:28] deal thou son of david have mercy on me
[43:32] and jesus stood still and commanded him
[43:34] to be called
[43:36] and they called the blind man saying
[43:37] unto him be of good comfort
[43:40] rise
[43:41] he calleth thee
[43:43] and he casting away his garment rose and
[43:46] came to jesus
[43:47] and jesus answered and said unto him
[43:49] what wilt thou that i should do unto
[43:51] thee the blind man said unto him lord
[43:53] that i might receive my sight
[43:55] and jesus said unto him go thy way thy
[43:57] faith hath made thee whole and
[43:59] immediately he received his sight
[44:02] and followed jesus
[44:03] in the way
[44:05] amen you may have your seats this
[44:06] evening we ask that
[44:08] god would add his blessings to the
[44:10] reading of the word
[44:13] amen how wonderful
[44:15] i just have to be honest with you i'm
[44:17] trying to gather myself
[44:19] and it's such an incredible atmosphere i
[44:21] tell you what if if people think jumping
[44:23] shouting dancing's all for show
[44:26] couldn't nobody see me in the office
[44:30] that was just for me
[44:32] that was just for me you know i believe
[44:33] that we can start off the new year
[44:36] by letting the devil know i'm still here
[44:40] just let him know i'm still here you say
[44:41] but brother aaron i struggled in 2021
[44:44] and i had my ups and downs in 2021 and
[44:48] but i want to say you're still here
[44:50] you're still here fighting you know just
[44:52] remind the devil tonight i'm still here
[44:56] he's been telling you that she was going
[44:57] to quit he's been telling you that you
[44:58] wasn't going to make it he's been
[45:00] telling you that you failed too many
[45:02] times he's been telling you that you was
[45:03] going to give up and quit look he's been
[45:04] telling some of y'all that for 20 years
[45:06] so tonight i feel like it's a good
[45:08] opportunity to start just letting him
[45:09] know devil we're still here we hadn't
[45:12] gone nowhere we hadn't given up we
[45:14] hadn't turned around and run we're still
[45:16] here fighting listen he has thrown
[45:18] everything he has at us he has thrown
[45:20] everything he has at us and yet here we
[45:22] are at the end of 2021 we've moved past
[45:25] it into 2022 and we're still here
[45:27] fighting and i'm just saying i want to
[45:29] encourage you if you haven't given up
[45:30] yet i don't believe you're going to give
[45:31] up i don't believe you're going to quit
[45:33] i don't believe you're going to go back
[45:34] because there's a c gene on the inside
[45:36] of god and that c gene is beginning to
[45:38] manifest itself and that seed gene can't
[45:40] quit it can't give up it came from god
[45:42] and it's going back to god i can't quit
[45:44] i didn't start this i didn't begin this
[45:46] i can't quit tonight and i want the
[45:49] devil to know i'm still here and i want
[45:51] us to look towards 2022
[45:53] and now with an even greater fervency
[45:56] than what we've had in the past
[45:58] this isn't necessarily a a new year's
[46:01] message as it were but here we are it is
[46:03] the first service of the new year so i
[46:05] want to encourage us to look towards
[46:06] 2022 with greater fervency with a new
[46:10] determination to not only to survive
[46:13] another year but to walk in victory i'm
[46:15] not just going to drag through 2022 but
[46:17] i'm going to be victorious in 2022. i
[46:21] want us to to
[46:22] to within ourselves make a decision that
[46:24] i'm going to grab every opportunity that
[46:27] i have this year to serve the lord i
[46:30] want to grab a hold of every opportunity
[46:32] that i have in his presence i want to
[46:35] recognize every time that we come
[46:37] together in his presence that it's an
[46:39] opportunity for something to happen in
[46:41] my life it's an opportunity for
[46:43] something to happen in my family and
[46:45] maybe in the past we've come together
[46:47] and it's just been another wednesday
[46:48] night it's just been another church
[46:50] service and we've all been guilty of
[46:51] that from time to time but i want us in
[46:54] 2022 to take full advantage of every
[46:57] single opportunity that we have take
[47:00] full advantage that tonight i'm with
[47:02] believers of like precious faith i still
[47:04] have the freedom to worship there is a
[47:06] god who is moving in our midst and i
[47:08] want to take advantage of that tonight
[47:11] we got to be more like jacob tonight and
[47:13] then this opportunity i want as he
[47:14] passes by and you know he's here you've
[47:16] already felt him even if you didn't feel
[47:18] him his word says he's here
[47:20] so be like jacob tonight and even right
[47:22] now grab a whole tub and say lord i'm
[47:24] not letting you go tonight till you meet
[47:25] my need lord i felt your presence that
[47:27] was wonderful but i'm not letting you
[47:29] just move on by now i'm not letting you
[47:31] go i'm grabbing hold of you tonight and
[47:34] i'm not letting you go until you meet my
[47:37] need starting even tonight let's not
[47:39] just say oh okay 20 22. wednesday night
[47:42] right now starting tonight this is an
[47:44] opportunity for you to get your healing
[47:47] this is an opportunity for your
[47:48] deliverance this is an opportunity for
[47:51] you to find the freedom of worship that
[47:52] you've been looking for
[47:54] this is an opportunity for you to hear
[47:56] from god i hadn't heard from god in a
[47:58] long time brother aaron right now is
[48:00] your opportunity don't put it off till
[48:02] later tonight
[48:04] and i want you to make up your mind as
[48:05] we begin this service i'm not going to
[48:07] miss my opportunity in his presence
[48:09] tonight
[48:10] i'm not going to let it slip by i'm not
[48:12] going to miss this
[48:13] because see it's up to us to recognize
[48:15] our opportunities
[48:17] it's up to us to recognize whenever he's
[48:19] moving my i believe that these services
[48:21] are predestinated moments
[48:24] but but even we learned from the example
[48:26] of the prophet he could recognize a
[48:28] predestinated moment he could see the
[48:29] vision vision begin to unfold
[48:32] but then he had to be ready to step into
[48:34] that vision and play his part
[48:36] so yes this is a predestinated moment
[48:38] and yes it may be a moment for you but
[48:40] you got to recognize he's passing by
[48:42] you've got to be willing to step in
[48:44] you've got to be willing to lay aside
[48:46] the things holding you back in your own
[48:48] human emotion and your own human
[48:50] complexes and say this is my moment this
[48:52] is my opportunity and i'm gonna step in
[48:54] to this moment i'm not gonna let him
[48:56] pass me by tonight and that's exactly
[48:58] what we saw was we read the scripture
[49:00] there with bartimaeus he knew this was
[49:03] his chance
[49:04] he knew this was his opportunity it was
[49:06] his only chance he wasn't going to get
[49:08] this chance again tomorrow he wasn't
[49:10] going to have this chance again this was
[49:12] it and he wasn't going to let that
[49:14] opportunity passing by he recognized the
[49:16] urgency of the moment
[49:19] he recognized this is it i've been told
[49:21] about this this is the one
[49:23] why do i need to be so urgent brother
[49:25] and walmart because he's the answer to
[49:27] all your questions
[49:28] he's the answer to that family trouble
[49:30] that's been going on he's in the
[49:32] building tonight he's the answer to the
[49:34] tormentor that's been in your mind
[49:36] he's the answer to the sin question
[49:38] that's been plaguing you
[49:40] he's the answer to those questions in
[49:42] your heart of why he's the answer and
[49:44] he's here tonight
[49:45] and he's passing by we must constrain
[49:47] him
[49:48] some of you right now are looking into
[49:50] this new year looking into 2022 and you
[49:53] have more questions than you have
[49:54] answers
[49:56] you're looking you don't know where
[49:57] you're at
[49:59] you don't know what's gonna unfold none
[50:00] of us really do know exactly what's
[50:02] gonna unfold but your life is surrounded
[50:04] with questions you have more hurts than
[50:06] you can bear
[50:08] maybe you've been engulfed with grief
[50:11] depression's been knocking at your door
[50:14] pain and struggle more than you can bear
[50:17] i say it's okay to miss some things but
[50:19] don't miss him tonight
[50:22] don't miss him tonight because he's the
[50:24] answer to those questions he can meet
[50:26] every one of those needs
[50:28] what are you crying out to god for in
[50:30] this new year
[50:33] what are you crying out for
[50:35] because each and every one of us have
[50:36] needs
[50:38] you say well nothing really changed for
[50:40] me in 2021 well allow me to ask you did
[50:43] you seek something to change for you in
[50:46] 2021
[50:48] did you cry out for your need every time
[50:51] he was near
[50:53] every one of us here tonight have needs
[50:55] we all have things that hinder us we all
[50:57] have things that keep us from being the
[50:59] christian that we really want to be
[51:02] and i just gotta gotta tell you there
[51:04] are some needs that will never be met
[51:06] without you making a move
[51:08] there are some things that will never
[51:10] change unless you make the move we're
[51:12] sitting back going god change me god
[51:14] change me god changed me and he passes
[51:16] by and he passes by and he passes by god
[51:19] changed me god changed me and he passes
[51:20] by but somebody's going to go jesus
[51:23] jesus i need you
[51:25] jesus i have a need
[51:27] but nothing changed for me but did you
[51:29] cry out to him did you seek him in 2021
[51:32] for the change that you're looking for
[51:36] you know your need tonight
[51:40] you know where you lack
[51:42] and you know where you need to grow
[51:45] and i want to tell you tonight that
[51:46] wherever you are right now he's calling
[51:49] you
[51:52] and that's what i'm going to speak to
[51:53] you tonight on he calleth thee
[51:56] he calleth thee
[51:57] he's calling you tonight to something
[51:59] greater
[52:00] he's calling you to something more
[52:03] he's calling you tonight for me
[52:05] as i was looking at this i read this
[52:07] quote this spoke to my heart
[52:09] brother branham's singing and he said he
[52:11] says faith in the father faith in the
[52:13] son faith in the holy ghost these three
[52:16] are one
[52:16] demons will tremble and sinners awake
[52:19] faith in jehovah
[52:20] makes anything shake
[52:23] and for my heart for 2022 i want to echo
[52:25] this prayer of brother branham he goes
[52:27] right into this and says that's right
[52:29] oh my precious faith precious glorious
[52:32] faith god give me faith
[52:34] by faith abraham by faith isaac by faith
[52:36] abel offered unto god a more excellent
[52:38] sacrifice than cain
[52:40] him being yet dead yet testified oh how
[52:42] we need faith i love him i want more
[52:45] faith my desire in this life and for
[52:48] this new year coming is more faith in
[52:50] god
[52:51] god take away any doubt that's in my
[52:53] mind if there should ever arise one
[52:56] satan fights at me he fights at you he
[52:58] tries to shoot his arrows but may i have
[53:00] that shield of faith always before me to
[53:03] withstand the wiles of the devil to
[53:05] knock off his fiery darts is my sincere
[53:09] prayer
[53:10] and as we go into this at the beginning
[53:13] of this year that's where i'm at i'm
[53:14] asking you where are you at
[53:17] where do you need to grow what do you
[53:18] need deliverance from what is it that
[53:20] you're seeking in 2022
[53:23] we read our opening scripture there
[53:24] about blind bartimaeus and
[53:26] brother branham does an incredible job
[53:28] of telling the story
[53:31] of bartimaeus in several places
[53:33] throughout our message and
[53:35] he goes all the way down through his
[53:36] life even explaining in great detail
[53:39] the difficulties in those days of how
[53:42] the odds that were stacked against
[53:44] bartimaeus
[53:46] i love stories like that because he says
[53:48] things like that and the odds weren't
[53:50] good and the odds were against him
[53:51] because it shows you that against all
[53:53] odds
[53:54] against all odds you're gonna make it
[53:56] against all odds in 2022 you're going to
[53:59] stand against all odds you will be the
[54:01] ones there in revelation 3 to him that
[54:03] overcome it look the odds don't really
[54:05] matter the odds don't matter tonight
[54:07] they didn't matter for bartimaeus
[54:09] because jesus was walking down the road
[54:11] they don't matter for you tonight
[54:12] because jesus is drawing near tonight
[54:14] and once jesus shows up the odds are no
[54:16] longer stacked against you once jesus
[54:18] shows up you and jesus is a majority
[54:21] once he shows up the odds are in your
[54:23] favor tonight so the odds don't matter
[54:25] regardless of how it looks jesus is in
[54:27] the building tonight
[54:29] against all odds you're still standing
[54:32] brother aaron is getting darker and
[54:34] darker and more and more evil my
[54:35] situation is worse than ever before
[54:38] you're sitting right where bartimaeus
[54:40] was sitting
[54:41] you're sitting in that same spot because
[54:43] it was his darkest hour
[54:45] and if anybody can that's been through
[54:47] anything will tell you it's in your
[54:48] darkest hour when jesus shows up
[54:51] it's in the darkest hour when he moves
[54:53] on the scene when you don't know how
[54:54] you're going to take another step when
[54:56] you don't know how you're going to stand
[54:57] when you don't know which way to turn
[54:58] that's when jesus comes walking on the
[55:00] scene
[55:01] it was bartimaeus's darkest hour brother
[55:04] branham would describe a situation like
[55:05] this
[55:06] in the first place he was shut off in a
[55:08] blind world
[55:10] dark never seen daylight that's a
[55:12] horrible condition
[55:14] he was penniless
[55:16] now to be poor and without money is a
[55:18] bad thing but to be shut off in a blind
[55:20] world without hope without mercy that's
[55:23] a tragic scene we have
[55:25] poor man ragged and his odds was against
[55:28] him
[55:28] he was shut off in darkness and was
[55:30] blind and was poor and was begging and
[55:33] in those days beggars strolled the
[55:34] streets everywhere lepers that couldn't
[55:37] work blind lame halt everything laid on
[55:39] the street and a beggar had a slim
[55:41] chance of getting anything to eat maybe
[55:43] the man had come out of
[55:45] of a morning had come and had one coin
[55:48] he could give to the poor and the first
[55:49] one he met he would flip it to him that
[55:51] settled it they probably didn't pay any
[55:54] attention to the beggars there was so
[55:55] numerous so many of them around that
[55:57] they didn't even pay attention to him
[56:00] it was really an awful
[56:02] condition
[56:04] life had not gone the way bartimaeus had
[56:06] intended it to go
[56:08] life had not gone the way bartimaeus had
[56:10] hoped it would
[56:11] maybe you're sitting here tonight 2021
[56:13] didn't exactly go the way that you hoped
[56:15] it would
[56:16] maybe the last 10 years hadn't exactly
[56:18] gone the way that you hoped it would or
[56:20] the way that you figured it would and
[56:22] maybe you're staring at 20 22 tonight
[56:24] like what now
[56:27] what now last year wasn't good the year
[56:28] before that wasn't good i hadn't had a
[56:30] good year in a long time what now
[56:33] my job isn't exactly what i thought it
[56:35] was going to be it hadn't turned out the
[56:36] way i'd hoped my relationships ain't
[56:39] exactly how i'd hope my life isn't what
[56:41] i thought
[56:42] can i stop and tell you tonight that
[56:44] he's got it all in control
[56:46] can i tell you tonight that he's got
[56:47] plans for you that are greater than your
[56:49] thoughts
[56:50] he has plans for you to prosper you he
[56:53] has plans to see you through that he's
[56:55] calling you tonight through all those
[56:57] disappointments through all the grief
[56:59] and sorrow and pain he's calling you
[57:00] tonight to walk with him greater than
[57:02] ever before
[57:04] he's calling you tonight to more of him
[57:06] he's calling you tonight church to
[57:08] victory through him
[57:11] look right like life takes roads that we
[57:13] never saw coming
[57:16] life takes those twists and turns
[57:17] sometimes it's because we chose the
[57:19] wrong road
[57:21] sometimes it's just because life throws
[57:23] a curveball as it were
[57:25] things come out of nowhere
[57:27] and as a boy bartimaeus never thought
[57:29] about being blind
[57:32] his aspirations were never to be a
[57:34] beggar
[57:36] he was part of god's chosen people
[57:38] he had been told from the time of his
[57:40] birth you're part of the chosen people
[57:42] he'd been raised to believe in jehovah
[57:45] he was supposed to be blessed as one of
[57:47] those people
[57:49] as a part of god's chosen people
[57:50] blessings were supposed to be upon his
[57:52] life they were supposed to come a
[57:54] messiah one day and in his heart he
[57:56] thought as a little boy maybe i'll get
[57:58] to see him
[57:59] maybe i'll get to see the the messiah
[58:02] one day for myself
[58:04] oh but now that could never
[58:07] now happen
[58:07] never see him
[58:09] now i'll never have that opportunity
[58:13] brother branham says and he began to
[58:14] think this is
[58:15] bartimaeus sitting there that day
[58:18] of when he was a little boy running
[58:19] around over the hills just a little
[58:22] jewish lad of about seven or eight years
[58:24] old how he loved to pick the little
[58:25] yellow flowers off the banks of the
[58:27] jordan
[58:28] and the beautiful hill flowers of the
[58:30] palestine what pretty colors they had
[58:33] and how his little dark eyes used to
[58:35] look at those flowers when he would see
[58:37] the pretty skies the big white clouds
[58:40] but now it had been black many many
[58:42] years
[58:43] then he remembered how happy he would be
[58:45] when his jewish mother would call him to
[58:46] his midday lunch
[58:48] she would after he would eat and take
[58:49] him up in her arms and go out on the
[58:51] porch go to rocking him for his midday
[58:53] nap she'd stroke back his black hair
[58:56] patting on the cheek and how his eyes
[58:58] would see her beautiful face
[59:00] his mama oh how he could remember it
[59:04] brother branham describes it so clearly
[59:06] that it's almost painful
[59:08] to think of him sitting there
[59:10] listen church satan's cruel
[59:12] sin is cruel
[59:14] what's been done to this world because
[59:16] of the fall is cruel and it's awful but
[59:18] there's coming a day when all things are
[59:20] going to be made right there's coming a
[59:22] time when all those things are going to
[59:23] be wiped away
[59:25] bartimaeus is sitting there dwelling on
[59:27] these things
[59:28] and he remembered too that she used to
[59:30] tell him bible stories that's good for
[59:32] mothers to tell your children those
[59:34] things bring up a child and the way it
[59:36] should go and when it gets old it will
[59:37] not depart from you that's what the
[59:39] scripture says and she would rock him
[59:41] and tell him of the great jehovah
[59:44] and there he was setting blind
[59:46] and how he must have been thinking this
[59:47] little boy how his mama used to get him
[59:49] on her lap and tell him of the great
[59:51] stories
[59:52] of how god did great things
[59:54] and maybe his favorite story was when
[59:56] moses crossed the red sea or when joshua
[59:58] entered the promised land just a few
[1:00:00] hundred yards below where they were at
[1:00:02] oh how his little bright eyes would
[1:00:04] flash and say oh mother tell me that
[1:00:06] story again before you rock me to sleep
[1:00:09] and as he take his hands and pat her
[1:00:11] pretty cheeks as that young jewish
[1:00:12] mother rocked him little did he know
[1:00:14] that he'd be sitting there blind someday
[1:00:18] maybe some of you little did you know
[1:00:20] you'd be sitting here
[1:00:21] where you're at today
[1:00:23] in whatever situation in a condition you
[1:00:25] find yourself in this isn't what i
[1:00:28] intended to be this isn't where i
[1:00:30] intended to be how i intended to be i
[1:00:32] remember the bible stories
[1:00:35] i remember the things i wanted to grow
[1:00:36] up and serve god i wanted to grow up and
[1:00:38] go in a rapture
[1:00:40] i wanted to see the coming of the lord
[1:00:43] i wanted to be an overcomer but now
[1:00:46] but now look at me
[1:00:48] look where i'm at now this isn't what i
[1:00:50] intended to be
[1:00:52] i didn't intend to be in a lukewarm
[1:00:54] condition
[1:00:55] just a church member
[1:00:58] you know many times we talk about all
[1:00:59] these uh things that we people can be
[1:01:02] delivered from depression and anxiety
[1:01:04] pornography you name it and those things
[1:01:06] those are mighty deliverances but one of
[1:01:08] the hardest things to ever see someone
[1:01:09] delivered from is a lukewarm church
[1:01:11] member spirit
[1:01:12] because they don't recognize that the
[1:01:14] situation they're sitting in is one of
[1:01:16] death
[1:01:17] they don't recognize that they're just
[1:01:18] sitting there once again it's another
[1:01:20] wednesday night here i am
[1:01:23] none of us intended to be lukewarm
[1:01:25] church members
[1:01:27] none of us intended to be backslidden or
[1:01:29] sitting on a pew with sin in our life
[1:01:32] none of us started this race to not
[1:01:34] finish
[1:01:38] and yet here he is now i'll never see
[1:01:40] him i'm blind
[1:01:43] i'm blind
[1:01:45] i'm never going to see him i'm going to
[1:01:46] be a beggar all my life that's all i'll
[1:01:48] ever be
[1:01:50] this is who i am
[1:01:53] well the devil loves to get you in that
[1:01:55] place right there of this is just who i
[1:01:57] am this is just a family trait that's
[1:01:59] passed down i can't help it
[1:02:01] this is just a family thing this is how
[1:02:03] my daddy was this is who i am high
[1:02:06] passion runs in my family so it's an
[1:02:07] excuse for for my inability to constrain
[1:02:10] myself
[1:02:12] he gets you in that place oh this is
[1:02:14] just who i am
[1:02:15] and we get to where we think about we
[1:02:17] believe but we can't believe for
[1:02:19] ourselves
[1:02:20] oh they can be saved
[1:02:22] they can be set free yes he can be
[1:02:25] delivered
[1:02:26] they can shout and dance because they
[1:02:28] can receive the baptism of the holy
[1:02:30] ghost he won't ever follow me because
[1:02:31] i'm unworthy
[1:02:34] he won't move in my life
[1:02:36] it can never happen for me because this
[1:02:38] is my condition
[1:02:41] you've been told all the stories
[1:02:43] you know god has done wonderful things
[1:02:46] you know he did those wonderful things
[1:02:48] in brother branham's day
[1:02:50] mom and dad maybe have told you all the
[1:02:52] stories or maybe if you weren't raised
[1:02:53] in the message maybe you just heard it
[1:02:54] right here over the pulpit
[1:02:57] god sent a message
[1:02:59] you are a part of god's chosen people
[1:03:03] brother branham's ministry had mighty
[1:03:04] works
[1:03:06] evening like tabernacle has been mighty
[1:03:08] works and up until tonight it's all been
[1:03:10] stories
[1:03:11] up until that moment for bartimaeus it
[1:03:13] had all been stories
[1:03:15] it had been what mama told him mama told
[1:03:17] him there was a savior mama told him the
[1:03:19] red sea open mama told him about joshua
[1:03:21] but all those things that was just
[1:03:23] stories was moments away from becoming a
[1:03:25] reality
[1:03:27] he was moments away from an encounter
[1:03:29] that would change his life forever
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:32] up until this point has just been
[1:03:34] stories
[1:03:36] oh brother aaron i know salvation's
[1:03:38] promised but maybe it's not for me
[1:03:41] i know there's promised healing i know
[1:03:43] there's to be deliverance i know the
[1:03:45] holy ghost can be poured out on people
[1:03:47] i know there's a promised rapture but
[1:03:50] because of the condition you find
[1:03:51] yourself in tonight you don't think it's
[1:03:53] possible to obtain it for yourself
[1:03:58] you've been depressed so long that this
[1:04:00] is just who i am
[1:04:01] this is just how i have to live
[1:04:04] i've been sick so long that maybe
[1:04:05] healing's just not for me
[1:04:11] i've struggled with sin so long this is
[1:04:13] i can never be free i'm just not an
[1:04:14] overcomer
[1:04:16] i can't go in a rapture maybe i'll be
[1:04:18] granted life at the great white throne
[1:04:19] judgment
[1:04:24] you've been lukewarm so long i'll never
[1:04:27] be on fire like that brother
[1:04:30] i'll never have that close relationship
[1:04:32] with the lord like that sister does
[1:04:35] i've been bound by fear for so long
[1:04:37] there's so much fear it's fear that
[1:04:38] keeps people from freedom of worship
[1:04:42] i've been bound by fear so long that
[1:04:44] i'll never be able to worship freely
[1:04:45] like all those others do
[1:04:47] i'll never have that
[1:04:49] true freedom of joy that comes with
[1:04:51] being set free in the presence of
[1:04:53] almighty god
[1:04:55] i'll never have that i'll never have
[1:04:56] that i'll never have that but i say it's
[1:04:58] 20 22 and jesus is calling you tonight
[1:05:02] it's 2022 and he's walking down your
[1:05:04] road tonight it's 20 22 and if you
[1:05:07] choose those things you know don't have
[1:05:08] to just say stories they can be a
[1:05:10] reality right here on a wednesday night
[1:05:13] an evening like tabernacle for you for
[1:05:15] your children in your life
[1:05:17] it doesn't have to remain a story
[1:05:19] tonight
[1:05:23] brother brown says let's just think of
[1:05:25] the old beggar sitting there now in his
[1:05:27] racket clothes shivering down into the
[1:05:29] shadows he didn't know how far he had to
[1:05:32] go to get into the sunshine
[1:05:34] maybe get run over by a horse if he got
[1:05:37] out any further
[1:05:38] sitting there in that hopeless helpless
[1:05:40] condition and not knowing that just
[1:05:42] right down the road comes salvation
[1:05:45] there might be that one person sitting
[1:05:47] here tonight maybe not so desperate as
[1:05:48] that man was but not knowing that right
[1:05:51] here in the next hour is salvation for
[1:05:54] you
[1:05:57] so the man anyhow is blind sitting there
[1:05:59] winter time coming on
[1:06:01] hopeless helpless
[1:06:03] nothing to eat hungry
[1:06:05] setting outside of the walls of a great
[1:06:07] cruel city
[1:06:08] and it's coming winter time shivering in
[1:06:10] the cold
[1:06:12] what a tragic scene
[1:06:14] my
[1:06:16] picture
[1:06:16] that could picture some darkness and not
[1:06:18] knowing that just down the road a little
[1:06:20] peace come relief for him there might be
[1:06:22] some of you sitting here tonight in
[1:06:24] almost that condition hopeless as far as
[1:06:26] medical is concerned helpless as far as
[1:06:29] any help is concerned and don't know
[1:06:31] that maybe standing right near you
[1:06:33] stands your healing just as close as it
[1:06:36] was to blind
[1:06:38] bartimaeus
[1:06:40] maybe tonight you don't realize
[1:06:42] that standing right next to you
[1:06:46] is healing for your sickness
[1:06:48] it's joy for that depression
[1:06:50] is salvation for your lost soul
[1:06:53] standing right next to you tonight
[1:06:55] i don't even believe it's something we
[1:06:56] have to guess about because i know the
[1:06:58] angel of the lord is in this building
[1:07:00] even now
[1:07:01] there is deliverance for each and every
[1:07:03] one of you whatever you have need of
[1:07:04] jehovah jireh is here
[1:07:10] things have been bad for bartimaeus
[1:07:12] blindness have robbed him of the life
[1:07:14] that he could have had
[1:07:18] blindness had turned him into a beggar
[1:07:20] and blindness was his taskmaster
[1:07:24] but all that was just about to change
[1:07:26] he was about to have his moment
[1:07:29] he was about to have his opportunity in
[1:07:31] his presence
[1:07:33] and it was all about to change not
[1:07:34] because a priest came walking by not
[1:07:36] because a preacher came walking by or a
[1:07:38] minister but because god almighty the
[1:07:41] lord and savior jesus christ was walking
[1:07:44] by
[1:07:44] he was going to see the messiah for
[1:07:47] himself
[1:07:49] he was going to see him tonight you have
[1:07:50] the opportunity to see for yourself not
[1:07:52] mama's story not daddy's story not
[1:07:55] brother tim's testimony not brother
[1:07:57] joe's testimony but your own testimony
[1:08:00] your own opportunity at a back side of
[1:08:02] the desert burning bush experience your
[1:08:04] healing your deliverance your salvation
[1:08:07] you have that opportunity tonight
[1:08:09] but some things will never change if
[1:08:11] you're not willing to cry out
[1:08:13] some things will never change if you
[1:08:15] just allow yourself to sit there as he
[1:08:16] moves past you
[1:08:19] but here in this presence
[1:08:21] wherever you find yourself right at this
[1:08:23] moment know this jesus is passing by
[1:08:27] he's passing by even now no matter how
[1:08:30] dark it is
[1:08:31] the stories are about to become a
[1:08:33] reality for you
[1:08:35] if you want them to
[1:08:42] he was about to find out that blindness
[1:08:43] wasn't how he had to live
[1:08:46] if you want to not you can find out that
[1:08:48] depression isn't how you have to live
[1:08:50] you can find out that salvation is for
[1:08:52] you tonight you can find out that the
[1:08:53] holy ghost is for you tonight you can
[1:08:56] find out that joy is for you tonight you
[1:08:58] don't have to live for depression you
[1:08:59] don't have to live beat down you don't
[1:09:01] have to live walking around listen you
[1:09:03] can find out tonight you're not going to
[1:09:04] commit suicide you are going to walk in
[1:09:06] life you're going to walk in victory
[1:09:08] you're going to walk as an overcomer you
[1:09:10] were not caught in this age for death
[1:09:11] you were not caught in this age for the
[1:09:13] grave you were called in this age young
[1:09:15] person to overcome to take a rapture
[1:09:17] you're not going to quit listen to the
[1:09:19] lying spirit of the enemy
[1:09:22] find out tonight that life is for you
[1:09:24] that he is passing by your way and begin
[1:09:27] to lay claim to it and cry out to him
[1:09:29] jesus have mercy on me
[1:09:32] what would you have for me tonight lord
[1:09:34] i need the holy ghost
[1:09:36] lord i need to see i need deliverance i
[1:09:38] need freedom from this depression
[1:09:41] thy faith has saved thee
[1:09:44] you have to move towards him tonight
[1:09:49] satan has warned against you to try to
[1:09:51] make you miss your opportunity
[1:09:53] he's trying to get you to miss it
[1:09:56] because if he gets too far and you let
[1:09:57] it go and you walk out of the place and
[1:09:59] you walk out of this atmosphere
[1:10:02] and you let that opportunity miss you
[1:10:04] pass you by so he's trying to war at you
[1:10:06] right now it's just wednesday night
[1:10:08] brother aaron's just up there railing
[1:10:10] and going on just whatever what am i
[1:10:12] doing tomorrow i got this going on so
[1:10:13] much has already happened this week and
[1:10:15] i got school tomorrow and he's trying to
[1:10:16] make you miss your opportunity but i say
[1:10:18] he's too late
[1:10:20] i say he's too late because there's a
[1:10:21] people recognizing that i'm here and
[1:10:23] jesus is here and he is the need
[1:10:25] supplier and he can take care of
[1:10:27] whatever i have need of and he's already
[1:10:29] calling you
[1:10:31] it's too late because satan may be
[1:10:32] whispering in your ear but jesus called
[1:10:34] us the tonight
[1:10:35] he's calling you tonight
[1:10:38] i say constraining for yourself
[1:10:40] constraining for your family
[1:10:41] constraining for your need
[1:10:43] constraining for everything you have
[1:10:45] need of
[1:10:47] that's exactly what bartimaeus did he
[1:10:49] seized the moment
[1:10:51] brother brown says and here he was
[1:10:53] sitting out there shut off in a dark
[1:10:55] world along the side
[1:10:57] along the side of him run the jericho
[1:10:59] road
[1:11:00] running up to jerusalem
[1:11:01] the cobblestones in the road was well
[1:11:03] polished for many travelers going back
[1:11:05] and forth over the road
[1:11:07] over the same road great warrior joshua
[1:11:09] led the children of israel many years
[1:11:11] before over the same road walked elijah
[1:11:13] and elijah as they went to jordan
[1:11:15] no doubt this old blind beggar sitting
[1:11:17] there saying
[1:11:19] in this dark world
[1:11:20] if i'd only lived in the day when elijah
[1:11:23] and elisha passed by
[1:11:24] i would have cried out
[1:11:26] and they would have prayed for me
[1:11:28] how many of us had i'd have been in
[1:11:30] brother brown's meeting
[1:11:31] he'd have called me out he'd have prayed
[1:11:33] for me
[1:11:35] jesus is calling you out tonight
[1:11:39] he's calling you tonight
[1:11:41] he said they would have prayed for me
[1:11:43] and god would have given me my sight but
[1:11:45] now all the people in the city and
[1:11:47] around say the days of miracles pass
[1:11:49] but perhaps down in his heart he
[1:11:51] believed that god still lived
[1:11:53] oh how little did he know that just down
[1:11:55] the road come his deliverance i wonder
[1:11:58] if that ain't our case tonight
[1:12:00] i hope it is
[1:12:02] you know for bartimaeus it seemed like
[1:12:04] just another day of begging
[1:12:06] it seemed like just another day in that
[1:12:09] blind condition
[1:12:11] he made his way to that spot just like
[1:12:13] any other day
[1:12:16] he wondered would he receive anything
[1:12:18] today just like any other day
[1:12:20] would somebody give me a coin today
[1:12:23] or will i be passed by once again
[1:12:27] you made your way tonight just like any
[1:12:29] other wednesday
[1:12:31] set where you normally sit unless
[1:12:33] somebody had your seat now you're in a
[1:12:35] bad mood
[1:12:39] and you wondered will i get anything
[1:12:41] today
[1:12:44] i've been here before
[1:12:46] came like usual
[1:12:48] others seem to receive coins
[1:12:51] others seem to receive a handful on
[1:12:53] purpose
[1:12:54] others get blessings others get
[1:12:56] delivered
[1:12:57] but could i possibly get something today
[1:13:00] or will i be passed by once again
[1:13:06] luke 18 35 and it came to pass that as
[1:13:08] he was come nigh to jericho a certain
[1:13:10] blind man set by the wayside begging
[1:13:13] and hearing the multitude pass by he
[1:13:14] asked what it meant and they told him
[1:13:16] that jesus of nazareth passed by
[1:13:20] brother branham said blind bartimaeus
[1:13:21] said if i could
[1:13:22] only been sitting at this gate when the
[1:13:24] chief captain of the host of the lord
[1:13:26] would have been standing there i would
[1:13:27] have gotten my healing if i'd just know
[1:13:29] that his presence was there little did
[1:13:32] he know that less than 200 yards from
[1:13:33] him right there came the same captain
[1:13:36] the lord jesus the captain of the host
[1:13:38] of the lord then all of a sudden there
[1:13:40] was a noise isn't it most unusual that
[1:13:42] where jesus is there's usually a lot of
[1:13:44] noise
[1:13:46] and we hear them coming out the gates
[1:13:47] screaming and some hollering hosanna to
[1:13:49] him that cometh in the name of the lord
[1:13:51] others saying thou mighty prophet of
[1:13:53] galilee and others saying away with him
[1:13:56] he's a witch he's beelzebub he does
[1:13:58] nothing but deceive the people he's a
[1:14:00] spiritualist he's a mind reader away
[1:14:02] with such a hypocrite
[1:14:03] and they were throwing at him over ripe
[1:14:05] vegetables i suppose i can hear him as
[1:14:07] some saying
[1:14:09] one thing and the other another in the
[1:14:11] great rush coming on and do you know
[1:14:12] where jesus is there's usually a mixed
[1:14:14] multitude like that
[1:14:16] it's always that way there's a mixed
[1:14:18] multitude some form and some against him
[1:14:21] but he comes walking on i can see him as
[1:14:23] he walks quietly a little frail looking
[1:14:25] body as he moved on up the side of the
[1:14:26] road some screaming one thing and
[1:14:28] another and all of a sudden there comes
[1:14:30] a sharp voice that blind bartimaeus can
[1:14:32] hear
[1:14:34] and as i see him sitting there and he
[1:14:35] started to raise up and the crowds was
[1:14:37] pushing him over and he falls to his
[1:14:38] knees and he said what's all this
[1:14:40] disturbance who is it passing by
[1:14:43] some of them pushing him off sit down
[1:14:46] and finally a kind-hearted lady bend
[1:14:47] down over the old beggar
[1:14:50] kind of lifts him back to his feet and
[1:14:51] says kind lady would you be so good as
[1:14:54] to tell me what's all this russian
[1:14:55] disturbance about oh sir perhaps you
[1:14:58] don't understand that this is that
[1:14:59] galilean prophet that's going by
[1:15:02] what galilean prophet my lovely lady
[1:15:04] what galilean prophet i've never heard
[1:15:06] of such a one it's jesus of nazareth the
[1:15:08] son of david are you acquainted with the
[1:15:10] scriptures blind sir oh yes i'm
[1:15:12] acquainted with the scriptures i was
[1:15:14] just sitting here in the sun thinking
[1:15:16] about the great jehovah god
[1:15:18] well this man who's passing by is jesus
[1:15:20] of nazareth his son who heals the sick
[1:15:23] who does good kind things to people
[1:15:25] oh you don't mean that's the son of
[1:15:27] david
[1:15:28] now he's too far gone down the road
[1:15:31] i'll never be able to get through that
[1:15:33] mob
[1:15:34] he's almost 100 yards to the road and
[1:15:36] then maybe 200 yards down the road how
[1:15:39] will i ever do it
[1:15:42] and that's where the enemy is and some
[1:15:43] of your ears tonight is too far gone
[1:15:46] your opportunity has already passed you
[1:15:48] by
[1:15:49] he's too far away from you you live too
[1:15:51] long in sin you've done too many things
[1:15:54] but if he is the son of david
[1:15:57] the spirit of god is in him and if he's
[1:16:00] the son of david he can hear my cry
[1:16:02] and he screams oh jesus
[1:16:05] thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:16:09] and the scripture says and he cried
[1:16:11] saying jesus the son of david have mercy
[1:16:13] on me and they that went before him
[1:16:15] rebuked him
[1:16:17] that he should hold his peace
[1:16:20] i find it amazing
[1:16:22] brother branham talks about how there's
[1:16:23] no way he could have actually heard him
[1:16:25] but he reached in that spirit world his
[1:16:27] heart reached out and touched jesus
[1:16:31] so some people want to take that and say
[1:16:32] well i don't really have to cry out he
[1:16:35] knows my heart and truth
[1:16:38] but i find it amazing that in the midst
[1:16:40] of the ruckus that brother branham
[1:16:41] described people yelling
[1:16:44] people shouting people throwing things
[1:16:47] it's an absolute mob
[1:16:50] and yet bartimaeus acted so loud that he
[1:16:55] disturbed the mob
[1:16:58] this wasn't just jesus
[1:17:01] jesus everybody was saying jesus
[1:17:04] amen jesus
[1:17:06] jesus
[1:17:08] jesus
[1:17:08] [Applause]
[1:17:11] jesus i need you this isn't one chance
[1:17:14] jesus
[1:17:16] to the point that the mob goes sit down
[1:17:18] and shut up
[1:17:21] he was out of order even to the mob
[1:17:26] he didn't care
[1:17:30] it was his chance
[1:17:32] when it's your chance why do you care
[1:17:34] what i care what do you care what i
[1:17:36] think why do you care what he thinks
[1:17:38] it's your chance it's your moment it's
[1:17:41] your opportunity
[1:17:44] jesus
[1:17:48] it's for you
[1:17:53] why do you care what the mob thinks
[1:18:02] you know the same spirits alive today
[1:18:05] oh you're going there again yep
[1:18:11] yeah let somebody begin to cry out
[1:18:14] and scream and let them cry out for
[1:18:15] deliverance
[1:18:17] well there goes that emotion again
[1:18:21] why do you have to do well because it
[1:18:23] worked for bartimaeus figured i'd give
[1:18:25] it a try
[1:18:32] it worked for others
[1:18:36] let somebody get a little taste of
[1:18:38] freedom boy you want to hear the chicken
[1:18:41] squawk
[1:18:44] let somebody get a little taste of
[1:18:45] freedom
[1:18:47] let somebody get healed
[1:18:50] let somebody get delivered from an evil
[1:18:51] spirit begin to shout and scream and
[1:18:53] worship
[1:18:54] sit down
[1:18:56] shut up
[1:18:58] pentecostalism
[1:19:03] just respond to the word in order
[1:19:08] what we need is sane and sensible
[1:19:11] just sit down and be sane and sensible
[1:19:15] you're preaching all work up and emotion
[1:19:18] i'm preaching freedom

[1:19:23] free
[1:19:24] i say be free in church be free in your
[1:19:26] life be free in your worship don't worry
[1:19:29] about what i think don't worry about
[1:19:30] what anybody thinks be free
[1:19:33] it's your opportunities it's your
[1:19:34] moments it's your predestinated times be
[1:19:37] free
[1:19:38] the message that we preach brought
[1:19:40] freedom
[1:19:40] it's 2022 and i'm not about to let them
[1:19:42] put my worship back in a denominational
[1:19:44] box of this is how it has to be this is
[1:19:47] how sane and sensible and don't do this
[1:19:49] and don't do that the message brought
[1:19:50] freedom not bondage
[1:19:52] so i choose to be free tonight i choose
[1:19:54] to worship in spirit i choose to shout i
[1:19:57] choose to let the spirit move on me and
[1:19:59] move however he chooses to move me
[1:20:01] that's how i choose to be in 2022
[1:20:05] he's calling you tonight
[1:20:07] some of you been wanting the same thing
[1:20:08] and now you're being called to a freedom
[1:20:10] of worship even tonight
[1:20:12] you're being called to be let loose in
[1:20:14] the atmosphere of the holy spirit he's
[1:20:16] calling you to praise him with your
[1:20:18] whole heart he's calling you to praise
[1:20:20] him with everything
[1:20:22] he deserves your everything
[1:20:24] he's calling you to forget about your
[1:20:26] need for control and step out into the
[1:20:28] realms of the holy spirit and let him
[1:20:30] have control
[1:20:31] [Applause]
[1:20:33] that's not who i am i'm not worried
[1:20:35] about who you are
[1:20:37] it's about who he is and what he's done
[1:20:40] and his spirit moving through a
[1:20:41] congregation
[1:20:44] why do they have to get all excited
[1:20:47] maybe if you understood where they come
[1:20:49] from
[1:20:52] you know people not in the battle don't
[1:20:54] understand
[1:20:56] people not fighting things don't get it
[1:21:00] maybe if you knew the silent wars and
[1:21:02] their deepest struggles
[1:21:05] maybe if you saw the tears at night as
[1:21:06] they lay in the bed and the heartaches
[1:21:10] maybe if you felt their hurts then you
[1:21:12] would actually rejoice with them when
[1:21:14] they found freedom rejoice with them
[1:21:16] when they found peace
[1:21:18] i don't understand why they have to act
[1:21:20] that way
[1:21:21] i had a young person
[1:21:22] say in one of our church services
[1:21:25] this is the only place i don't hurt
[1:21:31] it's the only place i don't hurt
[1:21:35] because of scars and torments and
[1:21:37] anxieties and fears
[1:21:41] i'm sorry if they want to get free in
[1:21:43] worship
[1:21:44] go ahead
[1:21:47] i'm sorry i'm not going to hold it
[1:21:49] against them if they want to dance and
[1:21:50] shout and run
[1:21:51] you know how you overcome that spirit
[1:21:53] join them
[1:21:55] want to overcome that critical spirit
[1:21:56] and understand what it's all about join
[1:21:58] them one time rejoice in their victory

[1:22:03] their salvation better yet get your own

[1:22:28] a pen

[1:22:36] problems this is what you must eat this
[1:22:38] is your sickness

[1:22:49] tonight
[1:22:50] he's calling you tonight and you're
[1:22:51] beginning to realize that there ain't a
[1:22:53] fence high enough to hold you
[1:22:55] there ain't a pen big enough to keep you
[1:22:57] bound down
[1:22:58] oh come on church
[1:23:00] set your wings a little bit this evening
[1:23:03] set your wings a little bit and jump up
[1:23:04] on a fence post as brother browning
[1:23:06] would say
[1:23:07] said brother aaron i don't know how to
[1:23:08] fly that's okay just jump up on the
[1:23:11] fence post a little bit
[1:23:13] just get up on the fence post and start
[1:23:14] flopping your wings a little bit i don't
[1:23:16] know how to fly doesn't matter the
[1:23:18] chicken's gonna get mad at you anyway
[1:23:21] get up there and begin to worship
[1:23:23] oh i can't worship with all that noise
[1:23:26] jesus
[1:23:29] i can't hear the preacher when they're
[1:23:31] doing all that shouting jesus
[1:23:36] oh you're making it dusty in my pen
[1:23:39] jesus
[1:23:44] i'm sorry mr chicken
[1:23:46] but i've just heard from my heavenly
[1:23:47] father
[1:23:48] my heavenly father said i can be free
[1:23:50] he said i can be saved he said i could
[1:23:53] be healed he's acting on my family jesus
[1:23:59] glory
[1:24:12] jesus
[1:24:17] you know chickens and eagles heard the
[1:24:18] same scream
[1:24:20] they was in the same church service
[1:24:25] eagle jumped up on the fence posting
[1:24:27] making dust fly everywhere shouting
[1:24:29] chickens
[1:24:38] [Laughter]
[1:24:45] chickens
[1:24:48] always squawking
[1:24:50] chicken what's all that noise
[1:24:52] can't feed with all that screaming going
[1:24:55] on
[1:24:57] you know i find it amazing
[1:24:59] that they couldn't stand the fact that
[1:25:01] bartimaeus
[1:25:02] didn't have church order
[1:25:05] they would have rather him sit there
[1:25:07] silent and blind
[1:25:12] and there's churches around this message
[1:25:13] today that would rather you sit there
[1:25:15] silent in church order and be bound with
[1:25:17] every demon of hell every pornography
[1:25:19] but as long as you sit there and you sit
[1:25:21] there and act right and act like this is
[1:25:23] church and this is how it's supposed to
[1:25:24] be and they're bound and they can't have
[1:25:27] any freedom and they can't get loose and
[1:25:29] the bartimaeus stands up to say jesus
[1:25:31] they sit down
[1:25:32] sit down no not even like tabernacle no
[1:25:35] i say get loose i say get free i say be
[1:25:38] delivered if you gotta shout shout if
[1:25:40] you gotta jump jump
[1:25:46] whatever it takes
[1:25:48] cry out to him jesus
[1:25:53] they want you to sit down lukewarm
[1:25:56] and just say i believe the message
[1:25:58] no barnums believed that was the son of
[1:26:00] god he believed this was the message
[1:26:02] that's why he cried out
[1:26:05] that's what caused him to scream out
[1:26:07] this is my moment this is my time
[1:26:10] the one that i have need of is passing
[1:26:12] by
[1:26:15] sit down shut up can't do it
[1:26:19] why are you getting so excited
[1:26:24] because it's my opportunity
[1:26:26] it's my moment
[1:26:28] i've heard from that other round
[1:26:31] he told me depression don't have a hold
[1:26:33] on me
[1:26:35] he told me that he was calling me out of
[1:26:36] my grief
[1:26:38] he told me that he was calling me out of
[1:26:41] my sickness into health
[1:26:43] he told me he was calling me to a
[1:26:44] refilling of the holy ghost in 2022
[1:26:48] and i'm gonna respond to it
[1:26:53] brother branham said he's your father he
[1:26:55] loves you and his nest stirring time has
[1:26:57] already come
[1:26:59] but we need another jump
[1:27:02] we got to the barnyard post but we need
[1:27:05] to get free
[1:27:06] so we can just ride on his wings for our
[1:27:09] first solo flight
[1:27:10] what a joy it will be when that great
[1:27:12] final day comes
[1:27:14] those who know how to jump and flop
[1:27:16] their wings those who know how to do it
[1:27:19] someday he shall come the great eagle of
[1:27:22] the sky shall come in glory and he will
[1:27:24] spread forth his great power the holy
[1:27:26] spirit and those who are magnetized to
[1:27:28] it shall take a ride for eternity
[1:27:31] forever
[1:27:33] you know we got this
[1:27:34] canceled culture that seems to be a
[1:27:36] thing these days
[1:27:38] even in the message there seems to be a
[1:27:39] message cancelled culture
[1:27:42] do they want to cancel the moving of the
[1:27:43] spirit
[1:27:44] look i believe in cancel culture and the
[1:27:46] message i believe it's time to cancel
[1:27:47] the devil
[1:27:48] i believe it's time to cancel formal
[1:27:50] church services i believe it's time to
[1:27:52] cancel intellectual lectures that have
[1:27:54] no life in them but produce nothing but
[1:27:56] death i believe we cancel those things
[1:27:59] and here's how you do it luke 18 39 but
[1:28:02] he cried so much the more thou son of
[1:28:05] david had mercy on me
[1:28:08] it was his moment it was his time and he
[1:28:11] didn't care who was around he didn't
[1:28:12] care if he seemed fanatic brother
[1:28:14] branham says there's his first and last
[1:28:17] chance he'll never pass that way again
[1:28:20] that's his only hope how do we know that
[1:28:22] tonight that there isn't men and women
[1:28:24] sitting here that's your only hope
[1:28:26] he may never pass this way again
[1:28:31] mark 10 49
[1:28:33] and jesus stood still
[1:28:36] and commanded him to be called
[1:28:38] and they called the blind man saying
[1:28:40] unto him be
[1:28:42] of good comfort
[1:28:44] rise
[1:28:46] he calleth thee
[1:28:48] brother and the devil says it's not for
[1:28:50] me tonight
[1:28:51] rise
[1:28:52] he calleth thee
[1:28:54] i'm so full of fear
[1:28:56] rise
[1:28:57] he calleth thee
[1:28:59] i'm so wrapped up in worldly things
[1:29:02] rise
[1:29:03] he calleth thee
[1:29:04] i need more of god this year brother
[1:29:06] aaron rise
[1:29:08] he's calling you tonight
[1:29:10] i want to know him like never before
[1:29:13] rise
[1:29:15] he calleth thee
[1:29:16] he's calling you out tonight
[1:29:20] don't let that go past you
[1:29:23] he's calling you
[1:29:25] tonight
[1:29:27] you are in his presence right now and
[1:29:29] he's calling you right now
[1:29:32] it doesn't really matter how wrapped up
[1:29:34] you are it doesn't really matter what
[1:29:35] condition you're in i feel so dead
[1:29:38] inside listen you're no more dead than
[1:29:40] lazarus was
[1:29:43] he was four days dead
[1:29:47] he was four days dead when jesus came on
[1:29:49] the scene
[1:29:52] look i want to say something to even
[1:29:53] like tabernacle tonight to encourage us
[1:29:55] as we go forward and i've dealt with
[1:29:57] this other places but i want to tell you
[1:29:59] this
[1:30:02] maybe this isn't for you tonight
[1:30:05] maybe you're sitting there and your
[1:30:07] christian life is as pristine as it can
[1:30:09] be
[1:30:12] maybe there's nothing holding you no
[1:30:14] chains on your life maybe you're well
[1:30:16] and mind well in body well in spirit
[1:30:18] saved sealed and all is right in your
[1:30:20] world
[1:30:21] congratulations
[1:30:24] i don't believe you but congratulations
[1:30:29] but you still got a role to play in this
[1:30:30] service
[1:30:34] because see jesus came to call lazarus's
[1:30:36] name
[1:30:37] but if we'll look in john 11 28
[1:30:42] it says and when she had said so she
[1:30:44] went her way and she called mary her
[1:30:46] sister secretly saying the master has
[1:30:49] come
[1:30:50] and calleth for
[1:30:51] thee
[1:30:53] now you may be sitting there not going
[1:30:55] oh i know exactly who this is for well
[1:30:57] my son he's been battling this and my
[1:30:59] daughter and all that family over there
[1:31:01] they need you
[1:31:02] well if that's your attitude you need it
[1:31:03] worse than they do
[1:31:05] but let me stay on track
[1:31:08] and you recognize and it's for somebody
[1:31:10] else listen mary and martha knew that he
[1:31:12] was there and that lazarus was the one
[1:31:14] in need in that moment
[1:31:16] but the master called
[1:31:18] her
[1:31:20] you still have a part to play in this
[1:31:22] service
[1:31:24] he's calling your name in this service
[1:31:26] because see there was a stone that
[1:31:27] needed rolling away
[1:31:31] how about we start coming to the
[1:31:32] services and start rolling stones away
[1:31:34] from tombs
[1:31:37] how about we come and we begin to pray
[1:31:39] and we begin to call on the name of the
[1:31:41] lord we begin to push that stone that we
[1:31:43] knows over that tomb push that stone
[1:31:45] that's holding your brother push that
[1:31:46] stone that's holding your children push
[1:31:48] that stone we want to see healing we
[1:31:50] want to see deliverance we want
[1:31:52] salvation and yet what are we doing to
[1:31:54] accommodate it
[1:31:56] there are stones that need to be pushed
[1:32:00] that person right there is all bound up
[1:32:02] is there any hope
[1:32:03] didn't seem like there was any hope for
[1:32:05] lazarus
[1:32:07] but there was a stone that needed to be
[1:32:09] rolled and once that stone was moved out
[1:32:11] the way there was a name about to be
[1:32:12] cold
[1:32:14] and there was a name that went down
[1:32:16] down into that tomb down into the depths
[1:32:18] of the dead down into the regions
[1:32:20] wherever lazarus was at and he heard his
[1:32:23] name called
[1:32:24] but it was because somebody else had
[1:32:26] helped push and roll a stone out the way
[1:32:29] we got to start gathering in 2022
[1:32:32] pushing with all our might together
[1:32:34] shoulder to the wheel shoulder to the
[1:32:36] stone let's move this stone let's see
[1:32:38] resurrection life let's see salvation
[1:32:41] let's see the holy ghost i'm going to
[1:32:43] push on this stone tonight with
[1:32:45] everything that's in me
[1:32:50] that way names can be called
[1:32:54] resurrections can take place
[1:33:00] maybe you're sitting here tonight just
[1:33:02] like bartimaeus you've been taught right
[1:33:06] but something's come in and cause
[1:33:08] blindness
[1:33:10] you can't see yourself being saved
[1:33:12] you can't see yourself being delivered
[1:33:15] you can't see yourself being free see
[1:33:19] one thing i've learned is that the devil
[1:33:21] wants to make you think that his
[1:33:22] oppression and his sickness and his
[1:33:24] depression and those things are
[1:33:25] permanent
[1:33:27] he wants to make you feel like they're
[1:33:29] unending
[1:33:30] and when you feel like something's
[1:33:31] unending
[1:33:34] i'll say this not to make a joke but to
[1:33:35] make a point
[1:33:37] christmas eve i had a kidney stone
[1:33:41] you know what makes it so bad
[1:33:43] you don't know when it's ever gonna end
[1:33:47] if you told me in two hours this is
[1:33:49] gonna pass
[1:33:51] i got this
[1:33:52] it ain't gonna be fun but i got this
[1:33:55] that's the thing with the trial
[1:33:57] you don't know when it's gonna end
[1:34:00] and so he wants you to think it's
[1:34:01] permanent that it's forever because in
[1:34:04] forever you begin to give up hope
[1:34:07] about four o'clock on christmas eve i
[1:34:08] gave up hope
[1:34:12] i said that's all i got
[1:34:14] i gotta go to the hospital the whole
[1:34:16] time i was like i can do this i can pass
[1:34:18] this
[1:34:19] no
[1:34:20] no my wife and the kids and i i joked
[1:34:23] about this ain't really how it went but
[1:34:24] they were on their way out to celebrate
[1:34:26] christmas with brother tim
[1:34:28] i said i don't want to ruin christmas
[1:34:29] for everybody so y'all just dropped me
[1:34:30] off at the emergency room so they barely
[1:34:32] slowed down door opened up i fell out
[1:34:34] and i just went on
[1:34:36] to have christmas
[1:34:39] my mama came up there to be with me
[1:34:43] i told that nurse
[1:34:45] i said i wasn't being very tough y'all i
[1:34:47] know that shocks you
[1:34:48] guys
[1:34:50] i told that nurse i said i'm trying to
[1:34:51] be tough she said son i ain't never seen
[1:34:54] a tough man with a kidney stone it's
[1:34:55] okay
[1:34:58] i said you don't know daryl baxter that
[1:35:00] man's tough
[1:35:01] batman stuff
[1:35:03] but he wants you to think that his
[1:35:05] oppression and his trials are permanent
[1:35:09] that your sickness is forever
[1:35:12] and that's where bartimaeus was but the
[1:35:14] time was fast approaching where he
[1:35:16] wasn't gonna be blind no more
[1:35:18] what am i telling you tonight the time
[1:35:19] is fast approaching that you ain't gotta
[1:35:21] be depressed anymore that your loved one
[1:35:23] ain't gonna be lost no more that you're
[1:35:24] not gonna walk around burning down
[1:35:26] anymore because the king of kings and
[1:35:27] the lord of lords is passing through the
[1:35:29] building it's not a permanent situation
[1:35:31] you're not permanently lost you have not
[1:35:33] missed your day of grace you do not have
[1:35:34] to stay sick forever you can be free
[1:35:36] tonight you can be set free tonight
[1:35:38] because jesus is in the building nothing
[1:35:41] that satan does is permanent nothing
[1:35:42] satan does is eternal but the works of
[1:35:45] my god they are forever they are
[1:35:47] fraternal they are permanent they hold
[1:35:50] the anchor holds when it grabs on it
[1:35:53] won't let you go
[1:35:55] satan tries to hold and he tries to bind
[1:35:57] and he can't hold you but once that
[1:35:59] anchor holds it'll never let go
[1:36:04] he's calling you tonight
[1:36:08] we begin to wrap this up i want us to
[1:36:09] look
[1:36:10] at bartimaeus's response to the call
[1:36:14] mark 10
[1:36:15] and 50
[1:36:18] and he
[1:36:19] casting away his garment
[1:36:21] rose
[1:36:22] and came to jesus
[1:36:24] now i want us to focus in on this real
[1:36:26] good as we
[1:36:27] come down
[1:36:28] notice that it says he cast away his
[1:36:30] garment
[1:36:32] this was important enough for the
[1:36:34] scripture to take note of it
[1:36:37] because this is no small thing
[1:36:39] this is no little thing because it was a
[1:36:41] declaration of freedom
[1:36:43] it was a declaration of i'm leaving that
[1:36:46] life behind and i'm never going back to
[1:36:48] it ever again
[1:36:50] it was declaring to the world what was
[1:36:52] about to happen before it ever happened
[1:36:55] is there people here tonight that can
[1:36:56] declare to the world things that are
[1:36:58] about to happen before they ever happen
[1:37:00] the things that you're wanting to see in
[1:37:01] 2022 and you can begin to testify and
[1:37:04] declare that those things are going to
[1:37:06] happen
[1:37:07] you see that coat that he threw away had
[1:37:10] to be worn in order to legally beg
[1:37:14] it was a beggar's garment
[1:37:17] and you had to wear it in order to be
[1:37:20] allowed to collect alms
[1:37:21] it qualified you as an arm collector it
[1:37:24] identified you as a beggar
[1:37:27] it was his identification that i am in a
[1:37:30] bound condition that i can't make it
[1:37:32] that i can't overcome that i need these
[1:37:35] arms to survive
[1:37:36] listen he didn't take it and fold it
[1:37:38] neatly and fold it nicely and put it
[1:37:40] there and that way in case something
[1:37:42] don't happen here i can come back to it
[1:37:45] in case i don't get the holy ghost that
[1:37:46] i'm seeking tonight i can come back to
[1:37:48] it in case i don't get delivered i've
[1:37:50] got it set right there but he took that
[1:37:52] beggar's garment and he said 2022 i
[1:37:55] don't need this anymore and he threw it
[1:37:57] aside and it was a declaration i will
[1:38:00] not beg anymore i will not be defeated
[1:38:02] anymore but something's about to happen
[1:38:05] something's about to change
[1:38:07] something is going to be changed forever
[1:38:10] it's a declaration of freedom
[1:38:13] i don't need these slave clothes anymore
[1:38:16] i don't need these grave garments
[1:38:18] anymore
[1:38:22] hallelujah
[1:38:25] before jesus had ever even spoke to him
[1:38:28] he said from this time on
[1:38:30] i will no longer beg
[1:38:33] i'm about to get my eyesight
[1:38:36] you got to come tonight with the same
[1:38:38] attitude this is it
[1:38:40] this is it it's over
[1:38:42] it's finished
[1:38:43] i'm not
[1:38:44] going back to it
[1:38:47] i'm not
[1:38:49] going back to it
[1:38:53] we are closing
[1:38:59] i'm not gonna wear
[1:39:00] this live oppression anymore
[1:39:04] i'm not gonna walk under this
[1:39:05] condemnation any longer
[1:39:07] i'm not gonna wear luke warmness as my
[1:39:10] daily garment any longer
[1:39:12] the coat of sin is being cast aside
[1:39:14] tonight
[1:39:15] see the devil wants to identify you with
[1:39:17] your affliction
[1:39:20] identify you as a beggar
[1:39:22] see he doesn't call your name he tries
[1:39:24] to change your name
[1:39:27] he does all he can to keep you from
[1:39:28] hearing your name
[1:39:31] so he calls you things and as long as
[1:39:32] you respond to it he'll keep calling you
[1:39:34] that
[1:39:35] but take that robe off tonight
[1:39:38] he's trying to bring confusion to try to
[1:39:39] change your identity
[1:39:41] he put labels on you labels of failure
[1:39:44] labels of sickness
[1:39:46] labels of suicide
[1:39:48] garments that would identify you with
[1:39:50] sin
[1:39:56] young people just for a minute
[1:39:59] he tries to offer you drinks of his
[1:40:00] water
[1:40:03] water that does nothing but keep you
[1:40:05] thirsty for more
[1:40:08] there's a thirst on the inside of all of
[1:40:10] us
[1:40:11] and the only real truth thirst quencher
[1:40:13] is god
[1:40:15] so that was what was wrong with the
[1:40:16] woman at the well
[1:40:19] she was so thirsty
[1:40:21] she didn't know how to quench that
[1:40:22] thirst
[1:40:25] she wanted somebody to love her
[1:40:29] she wanted someone to accept her
[1:40:32] she wanted to belong
[1:40:34] she wanted to have friends
[1:40:37] all good things
[1:40:40] but she began to drink of the water
[1:40:41] offered by the enemy
[1:40:44] don't drink that water
[1:40:46] if we had time tonight i could spend
[1:40:48] time
[1:40:49] describing to you the scars
[1:40:52] as i was saying to one of my friends the
[1:40:54] other day
[1:40:55] sometimes young people will look at a
[1:40:57] minister in somebody and everything they
[1:40:58] went through and say oh but look they
[1:41:00] turned out okay
[1:41:03] you can't understand
[1:41:07] the scars and the heartaches and even
[1:41:09] the torment
[1:41:12] that you will go through
[1:41:14] yes you may be saved you will be saved
[1:41:17] but what i'm trying to get you to do is
[1:41:19] don't drink that water tonight
[1:41:22] there are things that you may recover
[1:41:24] from and you may have eternal life and
[1:41:26] become a wonderful christian person but
[1:41:28] those things are hindrances in your life
[1:41:30] the rest of your life
[1:41:32] their struggles and their trials and
[1:41:34] their mind battles and that water leaves
[1:41:36] you thirsty and it leaves you scarred
[1:41:38] and it leaves you with broken homes and
[1:41:39] it leaves you with addictions and it
[1:41:41] leaves you with death
[1:41:44] and so many of us don't know how to
[1:41:46] quench that thirst but i'm telling you
[1:41:47] the thirst quencher's calling you
[1:41:49] tonight
[1:41:50] he calleth thee
[1:41:53] he's calling you and some of you are so
[1:41:55] thirsty you don't know how to quench it
[1:41:56] so you try social media
[1:41:58] and you search for likes and you search
[1:42:00] for followers
[1:42:02] and you search for validation and
[1:42:03] vindication in that way
[1:42:05] and you're so thirsty so you put on
[1:42:07] garments of worldly music
[1:42:10] or you try the garments of drugs or you
[1:42:12] slip on immoral clothes that scream i'm
[1:42:14] thirsty
[1:42:19] i'm thirsty i need attention i need i
[1:42:20] need validation i need people to like me
[1:42:22] i need to be accepted i'm thirsty
[1:42:26] and that drink does nothing but leave
[1:42:27] you more thirsty
[1:42:29] and it leads you here and it leads you
[1:42:30] there and the whole time you're picking
[1:42:31] up new regrets and you're picking up new
[1:42:33] scars and new pains and here's a
[1:42:35] temporary joy for just a moment but then
[1:42:37] it's followed by loads of sadness and
[1:42:39] guilt and then thoughts of suicide
[1:42:42] and yet the whole time there's a thirst
[1:42:44] quencher calling you
[1:42:47] he's calling you tonight
[1:42:49] and you're thirsty and you know you need
[1:42:50] that drink
[1:42:52] you can throw that garment off tonight
[1:42:54] if you've been in that water you can
[1:42:56] throw that garment off tonight
[1:42:57] because they become more than garments
[1:42:59] they become chains
[1:43:00] and the woman at the whale had
[1:43:02] completely lost her identity she was no
[1:43:03] more that lovely little girl that grew
[1:43:05] up on her daddy's knee
[1:43:06] that sweet little child she wasn't that
[1:43:08] no more she was an unclean woman who no
[1:43:10] one would even associate with
[1:43:12] and that was the garment that she had to
[1:43:13] wear on a daily basis
[1:43:16] that was her identity
[1:43:18] because in search for acceptance she had
[1:43:20] found emptiness and loneliness
[1:43:22] but see there was a thirst quencher who
[1:43:24] had need to go by samaria
[1:43:28] and you may not be in the condition of
[1:43:29] the woman at the well tonight but there
[1:43:30] was a thirst quencher who had need to
[1:43:32] come by evening like tabernacle tonight
[1:43:34] for your need
[1:43:37] and he's coming to meet you at the well
[1:43:39] tonight
[1:43:40] and one moment in his presence
[1:43:44] and all those things they were no longer
[1:43:47] her identity they became her testimony
[1:43:50] that led others to the thirst quencher
[1:43:54] the drink that he gave her not only was
[1:43:56] it enough for her but it overflowed her
[1:43:58] soul to the point that she wanted others
[1:44:00] to have it and she was no longer bound
[1:44:02] and ashamed and tormented but she could
[1:44:04] run into the city and those things that
[1:44:06] she used to be so ashamed of she said
[1:44:08] hey y'all know all those things i did
[1:44:10] all those things i did
[1:44:12] you know those things that used to
[1:44:13] identify me come see a man come see a
[1:44:16] man who took that all the way come see a
[1:44:18] man who changed my life come see a man
[1:44:21] and what did she say to that city he's
[1:44:23] calling you too he's calling you and
[1:44:25] he's calling each and every one of us
[1:44:27] tonight to take a drink of that water
[1:44:40] whatever you're dealing with tonight
[1:44:42] whatever it's called anxiety fear
[1:44:45] unbelief lukewarmness whatever it is
[1:44:47] it's a cruel taskmaster
[1:44:51] and it's trying to hold you and say this
[1:44:54] is who you are
[1:44:55] and he's trying to tell you that you
[1:44:56] just can't be free
[1:44:58] he's even convinced a lot of you that
[1:44:59] you have an evil spirit
[1:45:02] and brother branham is asking questions
[1:45:03] and answers i can't give over completely
[1:45:06] to jesus
[1:45:07] have i an evil spirit
[1:45:10] brother brown says i think that you're
[1:45:12] possessed of an evil spirit i think an
[1:45:14] evil spirit anoints you with those
[1:45:16] thoughts
[1:45:19] to make you think that you cannot
[1:45:20] surrender yourself to god
[1:45:23] when let me show you something why would
[1:45:26] you want to surrender to him because
[1:45:28] there's something out there calling to
[1:45:30] you
[1:45:31] to surrender
[1:45:32] it's a very good sign that you ought to
[1:45:36] surrender yourself
[1:45:38] it's a very
[1:45:39] good sign
[1:45:42] stand together with me
[1:45:44] if you will
[1:45:49] satan is trying his best
[1:45:51] in this service to keep you from crying
[1:45:53] out
[1:45:55] because jesus has been here and he is
[1:45:57] here
[1:45:59] and he's moving through this audience
[1:46:01] even now
[1:46:02] for your need brother aaron i don't have
[1:46:04] a bunch of sin in my life that's fine
[1:46:05] you have needs
[1:46:07] we all do
[1:46:09] none of which will be met if we don't
[1:46:11] move
[1:46:13] and we don't cry out he's telling you
[1:46:15] you're fine
[1:46:16] stay quiet don't move
[1:46:20] he can't keep it quiet forever
[1:46:23] he can't hold you down forever
[1:46:25] because he calleth thee
[1:46:28] he's calling you in this service even
[1:46:30] now brother branham says god's seen you
[1:46:32] before the foundation of the world
[1:46:34] he's seen you a human being like you are
[1:46:36] and though there come a million years
[1:46:38] yet there's nothing can keep you from
[1:46:40] coming back to that perfect image that
[1:46:42] god ordained for you in the beginning
[1:46:45] strangers they will not follow
[1:46:47] there's one voice calling you
[1:46:49] [Music]
[1:46:50] but the great shepherd's calling you
[1:46:52] tonight it's calling you for more
[1:46:57] luke 18 41
[1:47:00] saying what will thou that i shall do
[1:47:01] unto thee
[1:47:04] this way he's asking you tonight
[1:47:06] what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee
[1:47:11] and he said lord that i may receive my
[1:47:12] sight
[1:47:14] and jesus said unto him
[1:47:17] receive thy sight
[1:47:19] thy faith
[1:47:20] has saved thee and immediately he
[1:47:24] received his sight and followed him
[1:47:25] glorifying god
[1:47:28] he's calling you tonight
[1:47:30] what's he calling me to brother aaron
