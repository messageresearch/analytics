ventricles in the brain were dilated which means they were retaining too much fluid and not draining properly we were referred for an MRI and ultimately hey they recommended a C-section at 38 weeks because the baby's head was measuring so large due to the dilated ventricles so today Josiah is 13 days old and he's finally stable enough to have an MRI after the procedure the doctor came to go over the results and she said the MRI showed his brain looks normal the ventricles cerebellum and medulla all look normal we're so thankful God has worked a miracle on Josiah's brain amen they want us to

this responsibility lightly but we understand Lord that there's nothing I could say or do that would Lord free these people or or deliver these people Lord but that's a work you have done father and we're looking more that you would come and anoint your word that you would speak father Lord It's the anointing that would break every chain tonight Lord we're just asking father that Lord as we look unto you now you'll take control of the vessel Lord you see my nervousness Lord and just the things that I've told with today Lord in the word and I'm just asking that you'll help it Lord to be delivered the way you gave it father Lord we look to you now we just ask that you'll take control of this service in Jesus name we pray amen and amen amen if you have your Bibles we'll be turning over to Second Kings the 25th chapter the ninth verse we'll read verse 9 and 10 and then we're going to look to Nehemiah the second chapter you know as we prepare to to look into this you know as I was thinking on these things and and the revelation of Truth in this day and you know it seems like there's a lot of people who can recognize issues that need fixing it seems like there's a lot of people that can even see truths and and maybe have some Revelations but of those people there's too many of them that only recognize and never allow that recognition to put them into action hearers must become doers hearers of the word must become doers and we must allow the Revelation that we have of Who We Are to actually lead us into what we are to do it's not enough just to recognize who we are so so as we look here in Second Kings 25 and 9 this is the account of the destruction of the walls of Jerusalem that took place as Israel is being taken captive and exiled into Babylon and I want you to follow me tonight as we as we make some parallels between this wall and the wall of the of protection that we have in the word and the restoration of this wall and the restoration of the word that we've had in this day and it says here and he burnt the house of the Lord and the King's house and all the houses of Jerusalem and every great man's house burnt he with fire and all the army of the chaldees that were with the captain of the Guard Break Down The Walls of Jerusalem round about and then we're going to look in Nehemiah 2. in the first verse it says and it came to pass in the month Nissan in the in the 20th year of Arctic Xerxes the king that wine was before him and I took up the wine and gave it unto him now had not been Before Time sad in his presence wherefore the king said unto me why is that countenance sad seeing Thou Art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then I was very sore afraid and said unto the king let the King live forever why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my father's sepulchers lieth waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire then the king said unto me for what Dost thou make request so I prayed to the god of heaven and I said unto the king if it pleased the king and If thy servant hath found favor in thy sight that thou would Ascend me unto Judah unto the city of my father's sepulchers that I may build it and the King said unto me the queen also sitting by him for how long shall thy journey be and when will thou return so it pleased the king to send me and I set him a time moreover I said unto the king if it pleased the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till I come into Judah in a letter unto asaph The Keeper of the king's Forest that he may give me Timber to make beans for the gates of the palace which I pertain to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into and the King granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me amen you may have your seats tonight as we ask the Lord to add his Blessing now to the reading of the word notice there in in Nehemiah 2 and 6 notice how concerned the king is about the details he doesn't just say sure sure go ahead go Build That Wall and and best of luck to you good luck in your endeavors he says for how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return see he's interested in the details of our life he's interested in the details of the things that that he is putting in motion he doesn't just send you out there upon your own he says how long and and when will you return and the reason for these questions is is because he's wanting to provide every single step of the way he's wanting to make sure that Nehemiah has everything that he's going to need for the entirety of the journey and not only that but the king then puts it in writing so that Nehemiah goes on this journey with the authority of the king he goes on this journey with the official seal of the king listen he didn't just send us down here in laodicea and say good luck to you but he left you with everything you would have need of every provision you would have need of and then he gave you the king seal so you would have the authority of the king while you were here on this journey Nehemiah 2 and 9 it says then I came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king's letters now the king had sent captains of the army and Horsemen with me Church you're not alone tonight he did not only supply for your needs and give you a seal but the angels of God are around us tonight they are encamped about us They are going before us he said I'm going to send you but I'm not sending you alone I'm sending you look with the Army and with the horsemen of the army we are surrounded and well taken care of tonight verse 10 when sand ballot the horror night and tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel listen the devil don't like it when the Lord comes to take care of you the wolf don't like it when the shepherd's around the wolf don't like it when the shepherd's taking care of his sheep because he knows then you are protected he knows he can't rob you anymore he knows he can't attack you anymore he knows he can't bring false claims against you anymore it Grieves them that one had come to check on the welfare of Israel and in this day Church the mighty angel came down to check on the welfare of his people in this day to see the condition of the walls the mighty angel came down to see what was being done to protect his people from the enemy to make sure that the word that is to be our protection was being put it in the right place that the wall was being strengthened exactly how we needed it in this day that word was to be our protection he wanted to make sure that it was coming that the word was in its proper place so that it could defeat the enemy any place anywhere anytime and so the mighty angel came down to see about our welfare in this day and I can tell you just like here the enemy didn't like it one bit he railed against it he hated it because there was a message of restoration that came to restore the walls a message that came to check on your welfare to check on your well-being to make sure you were being taken care of the way you were supposed to be come on the enemy didn't like a message coming to restore what the enemy had destroyed Nehemiah finds that there is great work to be done the enemy has completely destroyed the walls and now those that have returned and are are trying to make a home in their Homeland are living in in Jerusalem at the mercy of those that are all around them they try to raise a crop but it's stolen they try to be fruitful but their fields are trampled upon they don't have the protection that they're supposed to have that the church would try to accept truth and begin to rise up but they would be struck back down Time and Time and Time Again by false doctrines by the power of denominations brother Branham would even see it in a dream there as a Triune club that it would strike the people with and he says every time she started to rise up meaning the congregation would begin to accept truth he would drive her right back down again with that false Doctrine he would come and down Through the Ages that the church that little True Vine would try to raise up and it would be struck down again struck down again because the walls had been torn down there was no protection there like it was supposed to be Nehemiah finds that that there are still Stones there but they've been jumbled up they've been burned over they've been torn down there's pieces of wall everywhere there's pieces of truth but with so many gaps there in the wall the enemy could come and go as it pleased the devil could come in whenever it wanted come in and Rob you of your joy rob you of your peace bring false truths in because the wall had gaps everywhere in it had the people living below their privileges the bride tree completely stripped down by the canker worm and the Palmer worm and the Locust and the caterpillar there was hardly anything left the walls had been demolished and the stones heaped up and burned to make sure that it would be very difficult for it to ever be rebuilt again he wanted to make sure that it would be almost impossible to ever be rebuilt again and you look around at our at our lives at the people that the enemy comes against and that's exactly how the enemy does he doesn't just want to see you fall he doesn't just want to see you fail but he wants to so ruin your life to where it looks like it could never be rebuilt again he wants to get into a condition where it looks like it can never be made whole to where people just give up on you to where people don't even know where to start but tonight I want to tell you that our God is in the restoration business it doesn't matter what the situation looks like it don't matter how far down he's taking you it don't matter if I gave up on you Mama gave up on your daddy gave up on you he's in the restoration business tonight he can turn your life around in One Moment In One blink of an eye it doesn't matter how scarred up you are one encounter with almighty God can change all that oh the devil would put years and years and years and years into the life of the woman at the well but One Moment In His presence One Moment In His presence and it changed all that it made her into a daughter of the Living God he can put years into your life but one moment in the presence of God can turn all of that around mere moments What a Mighty God that what the devil takes decades and decades and years and years to do God can undo in One Moment In His presence just one moment I say have a moment tonight if you need God just have a moment tonight just step into his present for what it is you have need of and have your moment tonight [Applause] Nehemiah looks over the place where the mighty wall once stood he looks at how it's been left in Ruins and knows it must be rebuilt a city with Broken Walls reveals the defeated people sitting with Broken Walls shows that people who are vulnerable a church with partial word and partial truth cannot withstand the enemy the first age had left its first love then it began to decline and it soon found itself in Exile just as Israel had him but that didn't satisfy the enemy he wanted to make the gospel walls so unrecognizable to where it could never be rebuilt he wanted to make it impossible to be rebuilt to the way that they'd had it there in the book of Acts the way it had the way it had been there in the in the upper room in the first age so so he goes to work dismantling the word Peace by peace and once that false Vine was in control it began to crush the life out of the church it hated how the True Vine would try to rise up time after time try to rise up and fight back and stand for truth and Time After Time the false Vine would beat the True Vine down again and again with false doctrines and so just how just as Nebuchadnezzar had gotten so tired of Jerusalem rebelling and Israel rebelling that he finally came in and just burnt the whole city down the false Vine gets tired of the True Vine trying to rise up and the false Vine begins to just squeeze the very life out of it and to tear it down and he does the same thing with the word that Nebuchadnezzar had done with the walls so the word is stripped down and torn down and mangled and heaped up true baptism is done away with the truth of the godhead has done away with intercession of saints and praying to the dead becomes the normal in the church Purgatory is taught worship is formalized the supernatural becomes buried underneath the ideas of man and Creeds and dogmas and then an ungodly priesthood is set up and the word isn't even allowed to be put in the hands of the Common Man anymore for the common man doesn't even know what the word of God is they might can look and see a piece of Truth they might can look and see a pile of rubble and try to get through and and all the dogmas and the Latin and the things they didn't even speak but it wasn't a wall of protection anymore it was just rubble and gaps and holes and the enemy could come and go as it pleased to the believer had no protection at all only misplaced stones in rubble crumbs have truths pieces just like the walls of Jerusalem but a king had commissioned Nehemiah to rebuild it he said rebuild the wall and I'll give you whatever it takes I'll Supply every need you just make sure the wall is built back up to where the people have the proper protection that's where they have a proper place to stand behind he was commissioned to bring Jerusalem back to the city that she once was he's commissioned and there was a word from a king that said I will restore saith the Lord I'll pour my spirit out upon All Flesh just like I did that day at Pentecost the word is going to be put back into its proper place once again it will be a full armor as it was there in Ephesians once again it's going to be Vindicated in power like it was at the gate called beautiful I'm going to restore it to its former glory the wall will be built back up [Applause] and not to Discount the other Mighty moves of God like Luther Wesley and Azusa those were great moves Mighty moves of God but they in no way restored the wall they in no way built the wall back to what it had been there in the first age they in no way were the book of Acts Church restored that's not what those moves were but they did uncover some very important stones that needed to go back in the wall they dug out that stone of justification that needed to be put back the just shall live by faith they dug out that stone there of sanctification that needed to be put back in the wall they dug out some very important truths but the church was still Bound by false doctrines the church was still Bound by false baptisms false ideas Creeds of man dogmas of man but there was a foundation there there was still a foundation there you could tell where things had once been but you needed someone with a commission from the King oh come on somebody you needed somebody that had been visited by an Angel you need somebody that was sent to restore you needed somebody that was sent to turn your heart back to the faith of the fathers to build it up how it had once been you needed someone with the king's Commission someone not afraid of the corrupt systems not afraid to stand and call out the religious leaders not afraid to call out the corruption and those that would corrupt others oh come on this is our Prophet we're talking about now somebody who stood in the face of criticism with thus saith the Lord nobody else had thus saith the Lord this was the one commissioned to rebuild the wall this was the one commissioned to put it all back in this place he stood in the face of criticism he faced Goliath he stood when his friends turned against him he stood to rebuild the wall he says in the church age book though he will not be popular he will be Vindicated by God as Jesus authenticated John and the Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well expect this man will be first of all authenticated by the spirit working in his life in Acts of power that are indisputable and found nowhere else I say Amen that's exactly what happened in this day he says who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in the last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride that means we will have to have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even more Vindicated than with any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day because this man will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself God will speak for him by the voice of the sign amen and that's exactly what happened in this day through the ministry of William Branham fulfilling Malachi 4. God came to see about the welfare of his people God came down to check and see how things were on the wall he sent one to bring a message a breast or weight Russian to fill in the gaps to take away the breach as it were to close up the gaps to put the stones back in place and the enemy hated it the enemy hated it it railed against it and they continued to this day to attack the messenger they continue to attack him because he dared to seek the welfare of God's people instead of the established religious religious organizations of the day he dared not bow down to the nominations but he stood and he said we're going to build the wall we're going to fill in the gaps we're going to preach truth if it costs me my friends we're going to preach truth if I don't have a Pulpit to go to and the wall began to come back up once again Nehemiah 2 and 10. when sen ballot the horror night and tobiah the servant heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel but see the very same message that grieved others it came to bring me liberty the very message that Grieves other brings joy into my heart it brings Liberty in my soul except this captive free I'm so glad that one came to see about my well-being they came to bring me Freedom he came to bring me Deliverance that came to bring me healing I'm so glad one came to check on our welfare it came to call us to be his broad [Applause] oh it greed sand ballad and sabaya but what did it do for the people it grieved God's enemies it grieved those that had their meal ticket punched by the religious organizations oh it grieve those but what did it do for the people if we look in 2 and 18. then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me as also the king's words come on Church we've heard the king's words in this day that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good work listen it wasn't just recognizing that this man had come from the King he wasn't just recognizing that he had been given a commission what they did is they took the message and they allowed it to strengthen their hands and they said let us rise up let us get on the wall let us do the work let us rebuild let us get underneath this same anointing underneath the commission of the king let us tear down the way to me let us attack let us stand let's stand with our Messenger stand with the one Vindicated stand on the wall tonight they said let us rise and the message strengthen their hands not just recognizing yes you're right the wall needs to be rebuilt yes you're right something needs to be done it's more than just a recognition or even a revelation that it's the truth it's more than that but the message from the King strengthened their hands strengthen their hands to do the work let us defeat the enemy let us cast Satan down let us come out from underneath oppression after all it's us who's being robbed it's us who's being attacked it's us who's being Afflicted let us do something about it let us take the commission of the king and do something tonight let us do our part maybe to others it was silly maybe to others their religion they had was just fine maybe to others it was too far gone maybe to others these things are just for AIDS gone by but to an elect people to a people called to be part of the Restoration in this day to a people called for the restoration and not just a restoration you're not just doing the restoration work you are the restoration work you are a stone oh that see gene on the inside of you cried out in a perfectly restored word matched up to you and the master builder said you go right here you go right here you go right here and the wall began to come up you're just you're not just building the wall you're a stone in the wall you're a strength to the building a strength to the kingdom you are the glory of this wall and elect people part of the restored Jerusalem the message called the people to finish the work that's what we're speaking about tonight finish the work finish the work this isn't to indicate that William Branham didn't finish his work we're not looking for another messenger or another man to come and finish something that he didn't he finished he finished strong he ran well he played his part there's no doubt about that but the work isn't the work isn't finished or we wouldn't still be here the work isn't finished or we wouldn't still be here because there is a broad body that is to have a Ministry there is a broad body that has a work that she must do a work that she must fulfill the message came not just to show you that but it came to strengthen your hands for the work that you must do it came to strengthen you it showed us who we are and now we have to get to work it showed us who we are it wasn't just the restoration of the word in this day but there's something that though that was supposed to be done with that word not just a restoration of the word for the sake of restoring the word but what are you going to do with it what are you gonna do with that word because there's a work that's to be done with that word there's a work that's to be done for all to be family you say well Jesus finished everything and he cried out on the cross it is finished yes judgment was paid for absolutely healing was bought salvation was bought he finished his job the Plan of Redemption was finished that's all true but there still has to be an application of that finished work brother Branham would say but now you have to take what he did and defeat the Devil personally he says the work was finished at Calvary and we only looked to that place and by faith we draw dividends off of our Eternal salvation and what we know is is that Jesus was the complete finishing up or fulfillment of the Old Testament man they that's right he fulfilled all the Old Testament but not the new listen to The Prophet here he said the word is in his bride the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord well no brother Branham had this note she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still now listen they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time what a responsibility as a major response we can't just be on cruise control we can't just be well I see the message yet the words restored what are you doing with it there are works for you to do there are things that you are supposed to fulfill there are things that must be finished and guess who is supposed to do it you no brother Aaron I just accepted this message and I'm going to sit on a Pew I'm gonna catch a couple tapes a week and yeah that does it for what what are you doing with it why are you listening why are you feeding on well to gang strength strength for what to go to work tomorrow this isn't natural strength what is this word restored for there are things that you are supposed to do with it you were supposed to continue the ministry of Jesus Christ on the earth in the last day not in one flesh of the body called Jesus but in a many membered body here upon the Earth walking like Jesus talking like Jesus defeating the devil like Jesus you are to fulfill those Works in this day it's more than seeing that the wall needed to be fixed it was more than seeing that the message is truth it's putting your hands to the work putting your hands to the work so that all things can be fulfilled you know we often preach about we've heard it for years that it's important to recognize Who You Are amen it is it's very important not to place yourself in the wrong place you know if you claim to be something you're not and you place yourself in the wrong place in the scripture that can be a bad thing very bad it's important to recognize who you are why well sure it shows you what your Authority is it shows you your Authority it allows you to cast down the lives of the Enemy No that's not who I am the word says I'm this and those things are all true and things that we need but knowing who you are in this scripture is important because it shows you what you're supposed to fulfill knowing who you are is important because it tells you what work you're supposed to do where you're supposed to apply the word that has been given to you Nehemiah wasn't going to build the wall by himself he didn't bring a message to the people so he can say now y'all sit back this is true the wall needs to be restored it's going to be built watch this no but his message called a people his message reached out to a people who were supposed to be a part of the restoration his message called for people and it strengthened people to do the work look Jesus knew who he was and so he knew exactly what it was he was going to fulfill that's how he could find himself in the scripture listen to this when brother Brown describes him coming to John he said suffer this to be so John that is right in other words John you're a mighty man you're a great Mighty prophet and your revelation of me is exactly the truth John had Revelation that's good enough he knew this was the Messiah that's good absolutely not he said your Revelation is exactly the truth and if we are the lights of this day we must fulfill all righteousness all God's word must be fulfilled by us for this day for it's becoming to us behooving becoming it's like us for if we are the true Witnesses of God today John we are the lights of this age and if we are the lights of this age there's so much scripture that's got to be fulfilled during this age and it's up to us hallelujah he says it's up to us to see that all God's righteousness is fulfilled and what is his righteousness his word brother Brown said it's up to us to fulfill all of God's word in other words John you know who I am I'm the high priest that's true John and I have need to be baptized of thee but we've got to fulfill all righteousness and I have need to be baptized of thee now to fulfill the word of God because all the words got to be fulfilled and we are the lights of the day and it's up to us to fulfill all this and I know that your your desire is to fulfill the word it's becoming to us we are the lights the light of every age to do the same thing we know what's to be fulfilled he says you who are spiritual and know the word of God you see what God has promised now the word will not come just easy or by observation you've got to press your way in to do it but yet it behooveth us it's becoming to us to fulfill all God's righteousness we must do it we must do it we must continue the ministry of Jesus Christ we must walk how Jesus walked it's restoring a church back to where it's not just one but it's many walking and laying their hands on the sick walking and tearing Satan's kingdom down walking and seeing the enemy cast out walking and seeing his brother strengthen it's our ministry we must see all the righteousness of God fulfilled Satan sees it happening he sees the people beginning to walk and talk and operate like they did there in the book of Acts and I can tell you he hates it he hates it because it's not just one person called Jesus doing it now it's not just 120 walking around doing it now but it's a worldwide body who's recognizing who she is and by seeing who she is she's allowing that to push her into action for what she's supposed to do and what she's supposed to do is tear Satan's kingdom down the word will tear Satan's kingdom out in your life in your life in your life in each one of our Lives if we allow it to work as the ministry of Christ repeated tearing down the enemy's strongholds it's no longer just a body called Jesus but redeemed flesh redeemed Sons redeemed daughters that he can overcome in that he can cast Satan down in who brother Aaron you your flesh your body it's you that's got to take this responsibility he sees people conducting themselves again like they did in the first age he sees people conducting themselves again like they did there in the book of Acts and he begins to throw everything he can at you to keep you from fulfilling what this message called you to do he throws everything he can at you to get you to sit back and relax and say I'm okay I'm fine I'm just in the message that's not what we came to this message for that's not what it called us for it called us the Rapture he told us to overcome he called us to feed every enemy to defeat hell it called us to do something and called us to be victorious you've got a work to do nehemiah's very arrival on the scene awaken that sleeping enmity that the enemies had for the Jewish people it awakened that they had not been worried about the Jews for years because they could come and go as they pleased they could take what they wanted from them they could Rob from them they could steal from they wasn't worried about them you let a church sit there cold formal and backslid stagnant and beat down and the devil sit back just as happy as he can be robbing them at every turn everybody the wall ain't built back up he comes and goes as he pleases but you let just once that church start to waken up a little bit you let that people begin to move a little bit once there was no Victory no overcoming no rejoicing enemy coming in through every Gap but you let those people begin to rise up and the message began to become a reality to those people you let them once stop being just hearers and start being doers let them one time begin to put the word in action in the works of Christ begin to act out through that congregation and you find them start to put those Dynamics where it's supposed to go in there with with the mechanics and they began to piece it all together one time let that start to happen and watch the enemy all of a sudden come awake watch the attacks begin to flow what's the criticism begin to come watch the enemy wake up then because he hates that somebody has come down to see about the well-being of the people that the spirits begin to move in that place and heal the sick and deliver the bound and save the laws and suddenly the enemy's like oh no what's going on over there it's fanaticism what do you even try to do who called you to this the king called us to this the king said restore the king said revealed the king said the wall could be built back up that's who did it I say wake up sleep in churches wake up and let the spirit move what meanest thou old sleeper the ship sink and Blake doesn't call on your God wake up [Applause] suddenly those Spirits begin to rise up and make themselves known and try to cast out on the work that's going on there oh it's all emotional work up chapter 2 verse 19 in Nehemiah but when sand ballot the horror night and tobiah the servant the ammonite and gesham the Arabian heard it what they heard was that they were rebuilding the wall they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing you're doing what is this worship y'all have going on what is all this praying for the sick hey what are you what are you doing and they laughed and they mocked and they made fun and they didn't think about nothing until Nehemiah showed up what no issue just somebody came to check on the welfare of the people oh but suddenly let's Mock and let's make fun then answered I them and said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and we will build I ain't worried about what you're saying God's going to prosper us I've seen the sick healed I've seen the law saved I've seen Dry Bones come to life I've seen young people filled with the Holy Ghost God's going to prosper us you know what I'm going to do I'm Gonna Keep right on building I'm Gonna Keep rising up above the criticism I'm not looking left I'm not looking right I'm just here to build tonight I'm just here to add another Stone on I'm here to do my part arise and build he says and this is very important and very dangerous he says but you have no portion nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem you have no place here this is a scary thought when the bride does the work that she's been called to do when she begins to operate in the ministry of Jesus Christ when the signs begin to follow when the gifts are manifested when demons are cast out those that have no portion in the New Jerusalem Will Mock and make fun of it he says you have no portion you're laughing and mocking at the wall being built back up that's okay you don't even have a place here you don't have to worry about what's going to take place inside these walls you're not going to be there is what he's telling them and it's okay they wouldn't want to be there anyway because that's how it's going to be in heaven there's going to be lots of shouting and jumping and running and screaming and praising God and if you don't like it here you wouldn't like it there so don't worry about it you have no portion or Memorial there when I was sitting there reading this in the study today this just hit me so hard look over in Genesis 21-9 and you see this very thing acted out again and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had borne unto Abraham mocking wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out this Bond woman and her son for the son of this Bond woman shall not be heirs with my son with Isaac when you see the mocking and the laughing and the it's easy to place that in Scripture it's very obvious so don't get turned to the side by that don't be worried about that look brother Brown preaches on it uh quite a bit in the name of the sermon escapes me right now but but he talks about in the last days he's bringing it there from Peter how mockers are going to be there you can't have the last days without mockers being there it's part of it's part of the word that part of the word is going to be fulfilled too that part of the words got to be fulfilled but there are a people that are called for the work there are people called for the restoration there are people when they hear that message and the message says the king told me this notice Nehemiah didn't even pull out the papers he didn't even have a picture he said these are the words of the king an angel visited me in my cave he sent me into the world the king's sword came down in my hand that's good enough for me that's good enough for me I say Rise From the Ashes get behind this one and rebuild be a part of the restoration the king sent a message he sent a message and I will not mock I will not make fun of I will not question I'll just say yes Lord I accept it I take it from me for my family we will build Hallelujah [Applause] these people recognize who they are and in so doing they recognize what they are supposed to do and nothing no amount of sickness no amount of demons no amount of Hell on Earth will keep them from finishing the work brother Brown says in the carrying away of Babylon remember if God has a work for you to do all the demons out of Torment can't take you they just can't startle you in any way God's got a purpose for the Holy Ghost Church and all the Devils of Hell will never be able to take it away God's got a purpose for it and it will never be destroyed until God lets it fulfill the purpose that he is ordained to do it and it will it will nothing's going to stop us church we will finish their work we will fulfill what we're called to do he said nothing can stop it until his purpose is fulfilled and it will be fulfilled it's more than knowing it's more than recognizing but tonight you got to put your hands to the work Lord what part am I supposed to fulfill what part am I supposed to play because we have to be the ones that fulfill oh brother Branham over and over again when speaking on the baptism of Jesus would emphasize and I know I've already read one quote on this if I want to read it again that they both had the revelation of who each other were and Jesus would tell John it's because of who we are that this has to be this way he says let God live in you to vindicate the promises of this day just as John as Jesus said to John suffer it to be so John that's right but we are the messengers of this day we've got to fulfill all righteousness and if we are the Christians of this day let's receive Jesus Christ into our heart and he is the word don't deny any of it say it's the truth and place it in your heart watch the fruit of the spirit upon you fulfill every promise that he made in the Bible God wants to fulfill his word and he don't have any hands but mine and yours he don't have any eyes but mine and yours and he don't have no tongue but mine are yours he's still want his word fulfilled but he needs somebody that will yield their vessel to him and say Lord Here I Am Lord Use Me Lord work through me I want to see it fulfilled Lord I want to see every word fulfilled I want all righteousness fulfilled Use Me Lord he says for nearly 2 000 years God has been again making him a masterpiece because he struck Adam to get a masterpiece off of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new and oldest husband and wife see in it take the old to foreshadow the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament oh I don't want to leave anything unfulfilled knowing that that responsibility sits Upon Our shoulders I don't want to leave anything unfulfilled I don't want to leave anything undone I don't want to leave one promise unclaimed I don't want to leave one devil unconquered listen that's what this bride's going to do every promise will be claimed every every devil will be conquered she's going to leave out of here a Victorious bride because that's the will of the father look all the ages before us left things undone every age before us left things undone they left promises unclaimed and they left word unfulfilled because they operated underneath portions they operated underneath gifts and manifestations and portions of the word and because of this they weren't under the same anointing that we're under I would call it under the fullness of the same anointing that we're underneath that you and I have today and so in every age there was always more to come there was always something else coming but this day this message didn't call the people so we can look to something else coming in this age this is the finishing message in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished this is the finishing age this is the finishing time you are a finishing people there's not another people to come we can't perpetuate the ages we can't keep pushing it off it's you it's me it's us it's now it's time we have to fulfill all righteousness it's called the people in this day like those on the wall and nehemiah's day that wouldn't come off the wall until the work was done they wouldn't back down until it was finished churches churches Brides brides listen down Through the Ages look David had been anointing but he failed Sampson had been anointed but he fell the devil had seen anointed men before but he'd never seen one like Jesus no there'd never been one like that man well oh and he's seeing churches there's been anointed churches he's seen Luther anointed but they denominated he saw Wesley anointed but they denominated he saw Pentecost with the gifts but they denominated but he ain't seen one like this one it's more than a gift it's more than Justified it's more than Sanctified it's bone of his bone blessed of his flesh power of his power she is him he ain't seen one like this before oh this ain't just some denominational church that's going to go down the scene already went down and I can tell you tonight the seed is up the seed is up the seed is up this is that this is the one that went down back again Hallelujah he ain't seen one like you before he ain't seen one like this before Glory she has the word and she knows what he wants done with it and it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness you know we always talk about the word being a mirror you hear that a lot of times the word is it's a mirror look into the mirror of the word and we often use it when we're talking about lining up you know this is how Christians should look look at the word this is how Christians should act look at the word and I need those things in my life sure that's a great way to use it but how about we start looking into the mirror and seeing the same victory I see the same victory in his life that I have in my life when I see him conquer death I conquer death he conquered hell I conquered hell he conquered the grave I don't have to go there he overcame Satan he defeated him with the word I'm just looking in the mirror that's me I'm an overcomer that's my bridegroom that's who I am that's who I'm going to be with and I'm going to finish his work I'm going to finish his ministry he tore down Satan's kingdom let me tear down Satan's kingdom there is a work for me to do in this day and I'm gonna do it I'm gonna get on the wall he says and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him no longer in portions like it was down Through the Ages under Luther and Wesley they couldn't finish the work they operated under portions they couldn't fulfill the Great Commission even they couldn't do it they couldn't fulfill John 14 12. sure there was anointing men in every age that did works of God Mighty works of God we take nothing away from that but the greater part of John 14 12 Finds Its fulfillment in the fullness of his coming The Works that I do shall you do also an even greater the greater part Finds Its fulfillment in the fullness of his coming how can we do all the works of Christ if the fullness of Christ had not yet come so it could not be fulfilled in any other age but in this age it's the fullness of the manifestation of the son of man Ministry third pull that's how these things are to be manifested in this day time after time brother Brandon would put John 14 12 with the other end time scriptures you can go and find this for yourself here's one example he says remember what time is it sir how many ever heard it say Amen was it exactly right then we've got the Revelation in the last days for the message of the Lord God to gather his bride together no other age has it been promised it's promised in this age Malachi 4 said Luke 17 30 Saint John 14 12 Joel 2 38. why now brother Aaron why now because this is the Omega Church this is the seed that went down come up again finishing the unfinished works of the bridegroom oh we're running out of time the revelation of who you are isn't to Puff you up it isn't to make you an intellectual it isn't to give you a head knowledge with a better Doctrine than somebody else the revelation of who you are is to show you what you are to fulfill that's why brother Branham says that when she recognizes who she is how what's he tied this to recognition then she can do the Greater Works there's a tie right there it's not just to recognize it's to recognize so that you know what to do recognize to know how to how to do it the king's message comes to strengthen your hands for work not just so that you know things and so we've received the king's message and once again I say let the mockers mock I know where this message came from let them make fun of the work that's fine this work has been commissioned by the king it's been commissioned by God Almighty the the bride is doing what the groom did and what the groom would do if he were here in his coreful body she's doing the exact same thing he says it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the Bride In Christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same the hour that we're living oh God the world is falling apart there hangs in the hangers bombs there hangs the thing to do just exactly the church is ready she sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies exactly because see the church the word the bride and Christ his ministry is in the bride which is his body he says the celestial body I mean to say the supernatural body of his here on the spiritual body on Earth his spirit is in there living his life right out until him in the church becomes one in the wedding you know the people that were called by nehemiah's message had a mind to work that was an anointing they were under to work driven to finish what the father had given them to do there's a people today driven to finish the work keep building keep focused get to the goal finish driven to work push to go another step some days you don't feel like it just take another step keep fighting keep going get the wall closed in get everything placed properly get the token applied take another step listen it has to be made ready it has to be fulfilled what is it driving it's the same exact thing that drove Jesus he says Jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work and just like the groom what drives us the bride is to finish his work if that's his will and he says that the bride has his word and she knows what he wants done with it he wants his Works finished he wants all righteousness fulfilled and he has a bride on Earth that says I'll do it Lord I'll do it I'll fulfill the word I'll go to work I'll Stand to criticism I'll stand the test you got to run with all you've got this is the finishing lap It's the final leg and the baton's been put in your hand you don't put people on the track handling baton and they go well you know what I'm really not that fast um um I'm not even sure why coach put me in this place no no let me tell you what when that baton comes around the corner and you get it no matter how fast you are you are there's a lot of people coming and they are coming fast so you get it and you run and you run with everything you got and you go as hard as you can and if you ain't got enough I got a guy that's got Grace to carry you he'll make sure you go fast enough he'll make sure you get to the Finish Line he'll push you across he'll take you to the end I'm just saying run run with all you got get to the finish line finish the work you've got to run oh the house of hell are on the track run for all your work get to The Living Waters get to the Finish Line word get on the wall get on the wall don't be distracted right now in the closing Moments by the mockers don't get caught up and if the others are doing their part you've got the Baton it don't matter what others are doing Focus don't be distracted get your mind back on the work Nehemiah 4 1 as I try to bring this down it says but it came to pass that when Sam Ballard heard that we builded the wall this is at the completion of it he was Roth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews and he spaked before his brethren in the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves in that how many times have you heard that when the devil's losing he wants to come and start making it personal oh you're so weak you don't have any real Faith who are you feeble Jews what do you think you're going to do see at this point in the story I said what do you think you're doing what do you think you're going to do these walls they're going to fall down one over me it says there's a fox runs into your wall it's just going to tip it over it's it's it's weak because see when you start doing the work that's commissioned by the king there will be mocking oh you think you can do the Greater Works okay oh you think they're still tongues in interpretation you think prayer lines altar call you think you can still receive the Holy Ghost now we've matured beyond that we we we're beyond that oh you think you can still be healed this message has so many flaws in it oh the messenger is so flawed there's so many and they point and they attack and they come to see what it is at this point in the story sand ballot and his other friend whose name's not out there and who I currently have forgotten are actually extremely worried because they're still saying all the same stuff they've been saying but in just a matter of days all of a sudden there's a wall there's a wall there and this reminds me very much of the exact same thing that happens when someone comes up and they're dealing with the spirit and you begin to deal with that spirit and he begins to say I won't come out oh we've seen it too many times I won't let her go I won't come out of it he's saying these things because he knows it's over it's finished and the last thing he might could do is possibly Bluff you enough to get you to back off I got news for you buddy we ain't backing off we ain't backing up we got you on the ropes we got you on the roach and we're in the final line and we ain't backing up we ain't giving in the wall is built the wall has been restored and we're standing on it and from up here I can see a mighty long way I can see King Jesus coming I can see a body King I can see a Rapture I'm not coming off this wall I'm not backing up I'm not backing down don't worry they're scared they're on the ropes they see the gaps closing they see Power being restored they see people operating in power and they're worried and they continue to try to mock and the wall grows stronger and stronger and stronger so the enemy at this point begins to send raids they begin to send raids and to try to attack the workers try to stop the work but the workers just arm themselves all workers just take up a sword they just take up Swords when they go to work on Monday morning they take up Swords when they go to school they take up Swords when they're mixing mud they take up Swords when they go shopping they take up Swords while they're trying to teach their and homeschool their kids and while they're holding the sword they teach their kids how to swing The Sword and everybody knows how to swing The Sword and they're like come on come on try to stop this I want to make a declaration tonight you can't stop the ministry of the Bride the ministry of the Bride will not be stopped it will not be slowed down it will not be hindered you can come you can throw your darts but the walls going up the bride is going up and we will finish the work we will finish everything that was left for us you can't stop this broad you can't stop this ministry we have been called for a promise this we have been called for this work we will finish this work you can't stop us there's gonna be threats there's gonna be lies there's going to be evil reports you're going to have people turn against you there's going to be mocking build fight while you work fight while you study fight while you watch housewife have your sword out while you're washing the dishes have your sword out you can put it up when your husband comes home but have it out while you vacuum have you sword out be ready any minute for an attack you don't know when he's coming but I'm telling you we're ready for him five different times sand ballot his Confederates challenged Nehemiah and the Jews to meet them in battle out in the plains why it had nothing to do with literally wanting to fight it had to do with wanting to get them off the wall to distract them from the work that they were doing but he would not be distracted all right listen you can't get caught up in drama well they said this about me and this church over here says this about this church and that church and that Pastor don't agree and they said something about me and they did this and they did that and the devil keeps saying somebody in the midst of all that because that goes on in every life that stuff but somebody's gonna go I gotta work I gotta finish I got a Waldo I got a bill I'm not coming off this wall to deal with that nonsense I'm not coming out into the valley to fight you right now I'm building a wall I'm going to do the works that he did I'm going to fulfill all righteousness I'm going to overcome I'm gonna Rapture that's where I'm at give me another brick give me another break this saying this this saying that give me another brick I'm Gonna Keep On Building I'm gonna finish this race well listen we're in a fight and brother Timothy said it best he said let's make it a good fight let's make it a good fight Acts 20 22 I was just thinking about Paul and how we all have something to finish and he says and now behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there saved at the Holy Ghost Witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things moved me neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God Paul says I'm going bound I don't even know what's going to happen to me I don't know how bad I'm gonna be beat I don't know how bad I'm gonna be scourged and none of that even matters to me he said I ain't worried about it none I don't even care about my own life he says just let me run just let me finish what God called me to finish it doesn't matter what it cost me in this Earthly life Paul says I just want to finish strong I just want to finish well Lord let me do my part let me finish what you called me here to finish I could put my voice there with Paul I know others ran their race others stood the test others did their part now it's our turn now we're on the wall the wall stained with the blood of Martyrs staying with the blood of others that have gone before life's given races will run just like brother Brown Paul ranwell Luther ran well Wesley ranwell William Branham ran well now you're on the wall brother Brown says as I said this morning in the message in our message this morning it behooveth us it's becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness it's up to us to whom the word has been delivered to it's up to us that we stay with that word and as we stay with it we see God working Among Us so it's becoming to us to stay with it I love this part it's a Heritage that God has given us it's a heritage those are my people as we might say those are my brothers that stood to build this wall I'm not giving none of it back you can't have one stone as a matter of fact I'm adding to it we're strengthening we're building up makes me think of Abraham Lincoln in the Gettysburg address where he made these famous words he said it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to The Unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased Devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion give it your all give it your everything don't leave nothing undone don't leave one promise unclaimed don't leave one devil hiding in your life defeat it all others have given all give your everything give your everything tonight the musicians can come there's an unfinished work but there's a people called to finish it there's a people called to finish the work The Works that I do shall you do also and greater that's our section right there that's where we're at that's the section that we're fulfilling brother Brown says I declare to you tonight my dear brother that the works that Jesus Christ did he never finished them he finished his life at the cross that he might pour it back into you and the church would do the same thing he did how long brother Aaron until he comes again oh but we don't do these things because it's after 1963 because until he comes again I'm still here we're still here so the work isn't finished there's still more that we can do what are you saying tonight brother Aaron build don't be distracted well I'm waiting on the Lord I'm waiting on no actually and I'm not going to get into it I got quote after quote after quote right here that says the Lord is waiting on you he says the bride hath made herself ready by finishing the works by taking the word and put it into action my closing quote says what difference does it make whether we got a nickel or a dime whether we got something to eat or whether we haven't whether we're living or Dying God promised the meek shall inherit the earth it behooveth us it's becoming to us that we live like it act like it that we fulfill all righteousness God wants men and women who will stand and fulfill all righteousness of course righteousness is his word are we ready to stand tonight if you'll stand with me to your feet as we close this a people he said that will stand and fulfill all righteousness a people ready to fulfill all of people ready to give their everything I'm waiting on him brother Aaron no he's waiting on a people to fulfill what he left for them to fulfill Nehemiah 6 15 so the wall was finished in the 20th and fifth day of the month ELO in 50 and two days and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof and all the Heathen that were about us saw these things they were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God the bride is fulfilling John 14 12. the bride is allowing him to live through her and Conquer through her and the work is being wrapped up by people who have a mind of work and the enemy is saying this work is being wrought by their God and their eyes are cast down they know what's done is of the Lord they know that you can't orchestrate these things they know these things aren't a man but what are we called to do today finish build they have the word and they know what he wants done with it it's not to collect tapes but it's to put the word in action the word and flesh in action you know we talked about the very beginning being doers and not just hearers you know some of the things we read in the books in the Bible that seems so marvelous so amazing so outstanding really we don't have to do anything special all we have to do is just be a doer of the word you don't even have to defend the
