TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] located in North Louisiana evening light Tabernacle has always held forth the scripture that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever today we invite you to delve into the scripture with us as the ministry discusses God's truth in our day Oh everyone where the ministry came and even in my Tabernacle in Minden Louisiana on our last discussion that I shared what the late Henry Green once said God started the church the way he wanted it and now he wants to church the way he started it read a very interesting quote from George Gallup that he said in 1987 in a survey that he did said there's a little difference in ethical behavior between the church and the unchurched there's as much pilferage and dishonesty among the church as the unsure and I'm afraid that applies pretty much across the board religion per se is not really life changing people cited as important for instance in overcoming depression but it doesn't have primacy in determining determining behavior so you know we're living in a very difficult hour where people are very religious at least my name but yet in that very actions are really not portraying the very life of Christ it was Paul said it this way in Titus 1:16 they profess that they know God but it works they deny him being abominable and disobedient unto every good work reprobate so you know doesn't it seem today that churches are really just competing with the world for entertainment and they degenerate it into nothing more than a happy fun time what do you guys think are y'all seeing out there I feel that sometimes the emphasis has left getting people to a born-again experience and has went to filling a church well there's a great difference between a church member and a member of the body of Christ hmm it takes the power of God to regenerate a son or daughter of God and Jesus said in his own words except you'd be born again you shall not enter into the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven so I feel that the emphasis have changed from the early church that it doesn't matter what kind of ungentle as long as the church's failed and they get them Church or become a member but there's no salvation in a church there's only salvation in Christ and this becomes a big problem when we face that we're living in the last days yeah I'll call when I first became a Christian the church that I was formerly at would have rock bands come in and do concerts on Saturday night and this was things that would attract a younger generation it attracted but it never changed her life and what they did on Friday night they carried on into Sunday morning or Sunday evening because they had this group come in so first-hand experience I've seen the church and their tools or programs to attract they want the younger generation and they do it entertainment they do it by these things of that nature but it doesn't change their heart and I believe that you know as Jesus says in Matthew 16 he built the church on a revelation and I think that's where we got to go back to is what is that revelation and you know he even asked his disciples who do men say that I the Son of Man am well they named this one and that one of this one and that one but he says well who do you it's got to be a personal revelation who do you say that I am and when it becomes a personal revelation of who Jesus is to you then he begins to build his church on that revelation that rock and that's why he gave the keys to Peter but because Peter had a revelation of who Jesus Christ was yes he was no longer the man that fished with him he was no longer the man that walked the shores of Galilee he became a personal revelation it is his Savior his redeemer and I believe that's where the church has failed is they got an entertainment but they don't have the revelation they can get people to the doors they can get them under their roof but then what do they do with them once they get there other than entertaining and to Joe's point they're failing to get them to the new verse and I believe that's where modern religion has failed and they have to you know resort to like a like easy believe ISM you know you believe on the Lord you're saved you know they take it to that and then and thereby strip the power out of the gospel so therefore you can live in your sexual sins you can live you know smokes smoking and all this stuff that just as you did as a all you did was to become a person of the world to a church member you know and and the gospel has to have power and we witnessed that we've seen it in just a moment there's somebody in the presence of God and the Holy Ghost comes down and moves in their lives that we've every one of us can witness and chainsmokers that instantly the desire was gone Oh second Timothy three in verse one even talks about that in the last days it's gonna be perilous times men are gonna be lovers of themselves of pleasure and things of that nature and in verse 5 they have a form of godliness they deny the power what is that power is to power the Holy Ghost to change to live an overcoming life to live a life of victory to live a life of joy you're no longer beat down and succumbing to the pressures of this world you can rise above that because it's not you it's a power that's in you which is the Holy Ghost which is Jesus Christ which was the emphasis of the Apostles doctrine the entire New Testament the emphasis to the church was the born-again experience in the power of God no I mean that's Jesus first dr. right you must be born again must be born again so he introduced that as his very first basic doctrine to enter into the kingdom of God because he said without this new birth you will never see or understand the kingdom of God and and of course you ever go to heaven without that new part but it requires excuse me for interacting but when you think about the born-again experience what does the church teach the born-again experience is well they teach you know that we are all sinners and we just simply say a prayer or walk the aisle or worse yet you know raise your hands with your everybody's eyes closed and all heads bowed no we're good we're good with God we're going to heaven but just because we repeat repeated a few words and made a confession affects their teaching saved in your sins right instead of saved from your sins when Paul said sin shall have no dominion over you and if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God is even in you so the first church taught separation from the world the very first thing that a person does when he repents a separates himself from the things of the world which is contrary to God so the popular belief today though is it we can add Christ to our life but not subtract sin which means there was no repentance yeah which goes completely against the formula given by Peter on the day of Pentecost when they said how should we be saved yeah they have to repent which means turn away from those yeah that's and and then obey Him in water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost this is what empowers a person to live and overcome and victorious life so it's not just saying a few words are repeating a few words and sheepishly raising our hands while no one is looking but it is more than that it's were that you meet God and that and there is a change on your life you can never be the same again exactly the desires that you once have you have no more your desires are completely changed so that's what the born-again experience really is is having your nature change your desires change you don't think the same thoughts you don't have the same desires you don't have the same attractions because you've now been you know you've been born by the Word of God and that's what pulls you that's what yes inspires you and that's what no feeds your experience is not the entertainment of the world because that don't attract you any longer because you've been born again or even church membership right if church membership was enough then four thousand years of Jewish history wouldn't have needed to be changed right but knowing the law knowing the holiness of God being obedient to the law was not enough if it was then Jesus wouldn't have come and brought us a New Testament it took the blood to remedy sin it's the only remedy of sin Church joining will never do it doctrine will never do it it'll take the power of the blood of Jesus Christ to remedy sin but there's an effect of the power of the blood because more than it you can see that effect even Peters life just automatically you know a man that went from denying Jesus Christ very good until where he received the Holy Ghost there at the day of Pentecost and what's he do he's not shirking away from from him no more and hiding in the shadows no he's on the soapbox preaching a message in 3000 Souls and they're willing to die yes a visible change visible to any large membership had been enough Peter would have been good before that moment he'd been with Jesus all that discharge and yet Jesus told him when you're born again yes so being a follower of Jesus had not done him any good up to that moment very good yes so this easy believe ISM has a chokehold around many Christians today and it's a part of fulfilling of Mathew 24:24 of where that there are many that are being deceived and and so they in works they deny him because iniquity abounds the love of many waxes called the Bible said because why sin is abounding in the church yes and so the love for God is really waxing cold and therefore they gravitate to entertainment when it used to be the saving power of Jesus Christ was the drawing power for the church that would we come to church the cause it amen yeah you gathered together expecting to see the holy spirit move you gathered expecting to see the power of God change lives heal the sick deliver the bound draw the backslider bat and so there was the attraction of the gospel it had it had a power to it and you have a church that no longer has the power of God working it loses the attraction so now how do we get people here back to what you spoke on with the entertainment and with this and they give them in the door but there's nothing changing them because the power is not there so your Christianity at that point is no better than any other philosophy so then we have to bring the world in and their bands and their music and their rock-and-roll and their entertainment and and then we have to manufacture smoke screens make the you know so that smoke is coming up because it once was a cloud of glory that would fill the temple and then we have to have all our strobe lights because we no longer have the light of the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire in the midst of the church so now it's all manufactured by man rather than something that is real and that is concrete and that is life change and that has power in it what was the attraction in the first age when men were in catacombs when they were persecuted and killed for the name of Christ what was the attraction to the gospel why did the church continue to grow under those conditions when they didn't have strobe lights and didn't have smoke machines and didn't have air conditioned buildings what was the attraction that attracted people to endanger their own life to become a Christian it was true salvation in his reality reality and we can't get warm by a painted fire and we're not wanting to condemn people but there is a Bible pattern and I fear if we don't meet that Bible pattern the Bible says great was the fall of the house that was not built upon a true rock well you know don't we don't want to condemn I do feel like there is a some that I have with him a heart when when we see people that you know want to be saved in their sins enough from their sins and yet the Bible is clear Paul said it in Romans 6 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace Miller fruits in the grace of God in the favor of God but he said O God for me every day how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein so you know the Bible also said they turned the grace of God into my seriousness which is unbridled lust and and also that site license for sin and so you know that's that is what the gospel has degenerated to but I am convinced that God has to help a bride without spot or wrinkle he's got to have a church if you said I'm going to have a church well he cannot fail he has to do what he said he would do if he's God and we know he's got a man and that church will match the original Church in the book of Acts it'll be a continuation of the book of Acts Luke in the upper room they didn't have to manufacture fire and smoke screen the pillar of fire came in and it was real manufactured it was real and it changed lives and there you see the attraction they come down under the power of the Holy Ghost and with that true attraction one sermon three thousand souls added to the kingdom because it wasn't a manufactured attraction the Bible said in acts 11:15 when when Peter went into Cornelius house and he began to preach under them Jesus led by a vision to that house as he began to preach unto them Jesus the Holy Ghost fell upon him and he went back and reported to the Jews they're like what were you doing in a Gentiles house that he began to give the testimony and he picked up an axe 11:15 he said and as I began to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them the Gentiles as on us at the beginning and so Peter was signifying that the beginning of the New Testament church took place on the day of Pentecost yes well Jesus said that they were to wait until they were endued with power from on high and that was the place where Jesus poured his spirit out upon the church it was never a church membership for God added to the church daily such as should be saved America it was the power of God that gave birth to the New Testament church the end it must end the same way that it began right absolutely so we've got to come back to the absolute we've got to come back to the author and the finisher of our faith if he was there at the beginning he's got to be here at amen so it's got to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever because apart from Jesus you do not even know truth amen unless you hold to his teaching you're not his disciple at all so you know there must be a love for truth or you're gonna be swept away from by the strong delusion that is in the land today you know and the strong delusion comes and it makes truth so like hate because people hate true that's true that is and so you know Isaiah five-and-twenty says woe to them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter woe to them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight so um there again I believe that Jesus today is seeking for worshipers who will worship in sincerity and in truth two things sincere people who are looking for truth and that's what we are about because jesus said if you hold a man teaching then you are really my disciples and then you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free and so you know every church goer we say today they claim they want to follow Jesus until if they find out where he stays but I believe that God started a church the way he wants and no he wants that survey the way he started and you know in our next session I think it'll be good to down further into this where we can see that that God is still here I live yes in the midst of his people and the same yesterday today you thank
