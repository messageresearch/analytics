[37:22] expectation
[37:24] i was texting brother ron earlier to

[37:29] i'm like man that's my expectation so
[37:31] the word for these meetings are epic so
[37:34] we want an epic outpouring of the holy
[37:37] ghost you say well brother joe that's
[37:38] not who i am will you let that epic
[37:40] outpouring fall on you and you may do
[37:42] something you didn't think you would do
[37:44] so i say lord that's where i'm at
[37:46] tonight i'm i'm looking for a great
[37:48] outpouring of the spirit of god and so
[37:50] whatever we have need of i believe he's
[37:52] here to minister to our needs
[37:54] we'll look here uh
[37:56] hebrews 13 and verse eight i know
[37:58] brother timothy has done an outstanding
[37:59] job on his uh sermons that he's been
[38:02] preaching on jesus christ the same
[38:04] so i want to speak to you tonight on god
[38:06] does impossible math part 10.
[38:09] jesus christ the same today part two
[38:12] but i want to give it a subtitle what
[38:14] are you going to do
[38:16] so i know that's a long title and it's
[38:19] saying a lot god does impossible may we
[38:21] never forget that god does the
[38:23] impossible
[38:25] but that god does the impossible through
[38:27] you
[38:28] and nothing is impossible for them that
[38:29] believe but also we must realize that
[38:32] jesus christ is the same today
[38:36] and i want our focus to be on what are
[38:39] you going to do so we read here in
[38:41] hebrews 13 and verse 8 jesus christ the
[38:44] same yesterday
[38:46] today
[38:47] and forever god bless you you can have
[38:49] your seats tonight i'm also going to
[38:51] look at another another scripture
[38:52] reading here in luke 4 and verse 17 it
[38:54] says there was delivered
[38:57] unto him the book of the prophet
[38:58] isaiah's and when he had opened the book
[39:01] he found the place where it was written
[39:03] written
[39:05] the lord
[39:06] is upon or the spirit of the lord is
[39:08] upon me because he hath anointed me to
[39:11] preach the gospel
[39:13] to the poor
[39:14] notice he hath anointed me he found his
[39:17] place in the scriptures
[39:19] and the place that he found was he hath
[39:22] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[39:25] poor
[39:26] he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[39:29] to preach deliverance to the captive and
[39:32] the recovering of sight to the blind and
[39:35] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[39:38] and to preach the acceptable year of the
[39:40] lord and he closed the book and he gave
[39:43] it again to the minister and he sat down
[39:45] and all the eyes of them that were in
[39:47] the synagogue were fastened on him and
[39:49] he began to say unto them this day
[39:53] this day
[39:55] 9 29 21 this day
[39:58] this scripture is fulfilled
[40:01] in your ears
[40:03] so we find here in luke 14 jesus finding
[40:06] the place that pertains to his ministry
[40:09] and his commission to preach the gospel
[40:12] then we look over in mark 16 and verse
[40:14] 15
[40:15] he said unto them
[40:17] he said unto them
[40:19] go ye into all the world and preach the
[40:22] gospel to every creature
[40:25] so we find in luke jesus finds his place
[40:28] he finds where he's been anointed to
[40:29] preach the gospel but not only that in
[40:32] mark 16 we find that he commissions his
[40:34] disciples that this very same things
[40:36] that he did they were to do also and it
[40:39] was not just to himself see where he
[40:42] preached the gospel he healed the
[40:44] brokenhearted he preached deliverance to
[40:46] the captive he gave sight to the blind
[40:48] he said it liberty those that were
[40:49] bruised and we found the very things
[40:52] that he did in the book of acts his
[40:54] disciples carried the same ministry on
[40:57] they did the same things that they saw
[41:00] him do
[41:03] so what we find is the book of acts was
[41:05] a continuation was the manifestation of
[41:07] jesus christ
[41:09] for their day
[41:10] for that day every day that they got up
[41:12] and somebody received healing that was
[41:14] jesus christ today
[41:16] and we find here in the message or in
[41:18] the exposition of the seven church ages
[41:20] i want you to listen to this and brother
[41:22] brown says he says now remember this
[41:25] christ in the
[41:26] true church is a continuation of the
[41:29] book of acts
[41:31] so christ in the true church
[41:34] is a continuation of the book of acts so
[41:37] we're not being turned back to pentecost
[41:39] in an effort to start over
[41:42] all right no we're being turned back to
[41:45] pentecost so that we can continue the
[41:47] same works the same signs the same
[41:50] wonders that was poured out in the upper
[41:52] room that followed down through the the
[41:54] the disciples is the very same things
[41:57] that this end time bride is being turned
[42:00] back to we're being turned back to
[42:02] pentecost so we can continue the book of
[42:04] acts ministry
[42:07] so the same things that they did
[42:09] we are to do as well
[42:13] inside man he says we are his hands on
[42:16] earth
[42:17] we are his eyes on earth
[42:20] we are his gospel on earth
[42:25] and the gospel is not all together by
[42:28] the word he said the word made manifest
[42:31] is the gospel
[42:34] now i just started my timer so y'all got
[42:36] 10 minutes free
[42:39] but he said the word made manifest is
[42:42] the gospel
[42:44] so each of us we find through the
[42:46] through the scriptures and through the
[42:47] quotes that we have been commissioned to
[42:49] preach the gospel well you say brother
[42:52] joe i'm a female well i'm not talking
[42:54] about in that aspect some of you may
[42:56] never be called to stand behind this
[42:58] pulpit and take a thought and declare it
[43:00] to the people but that doesn't mean that
[43:02] you're not called to preach the gospel
[43:05] your life is called to manifest this
[43:07] book your life is called the manifest
[43:10] the end time message your life is the
[43:13] only book that some people will ever
[43:15] read and your life is preaching the
[43:17] gospel your life is manifesting what is
[43:20] in the word of god your life is bringing
[43:22] forth every promise of god your life is
[43:24] declared that he's the same today as he
[43:27] was yesterday
[43:29] your life does that
[43:31] by your faith to take god in his word
[43:34] and to manifest what he says and let
[43:36] this word do what it said it will do
[43:40] so we find by allowing the word to
[43:43] produce in you what it says that it will
[43:45] do is the gospel
[43:48] now we're going to go dig into this a
[43:49] little bit more tonight
[43:51] don't worry i'm not a teacher you don't
[43:52] have to get scared
[43:54] brother joe's a little bit slow tonight
[43:55] he's teaching no don't worry
[43:58] but we find in the body of believers
[44:00] there's healing
[44:02] all right in the body of believers
[44:04] there's discernment
[44:06] in the body of believers there's
[44:08] deliverance to those that have been
[44:09] bound captive in the body of believers
[44:12] there is liberty to those that have been
[44:14] bruised
[44:15] maybe you have a past but in the body of
[44:17] believers there's liberty from your past
[44:20] there's liberty from your failures
[44:22] there's liberty from your mistakes in
[44:24] the body of believers there is liberty
[44:26] for the sons and daughters of god
[44:29] see what the word did in christ or what
[44:32] christ manifested in the alpha church is
[44:35] to manifest in the omega church so that
[44:37] proves that he is the same today just as
[44:40] he was yesterday
[44:44] so christ doesn't change
[44:46] how happy can we be tonight we don't
[44:48] have to wonder we don't have to go and
[44:50] guess what will he do how would he
[44:52] respond what is god going to do you can
[44:54] comb through the pages of this bible and
[44:57] you can find exactly what is expected of
[44:59] you in this hour
[45:02] come on church
[45:04] he says in possessing of the enemy's
[45:06] gates listen what the prophet god would
[45:08] tell us 1959 he says in the church of
[45:12] the living god this morning lays the
[45:15] power to heal all sickness
[45:17] he didn't say in a prophet he said in
[45:19] the church of the living god
[45:21] he didn't say him brother aaron or
[45:23] brother tim or brother donny or brother
[45:25] ron brother timothy brother joe whoever
[45:27] your favorite preacher is he says in the
[45:29] church of the living god that's you
[45:32] tonight church you're the church of the
[45:34] living god in the church of the living
[45:37] god this morning lays the power to heal
[45:40] all sickness
[45:41] in the church of the living god lays
[45:43] power to overcome all temptation you
[45:46] hear that young men
[45:49] you hear that tonight when pornography
[45:51] is trying to grip your life in the
[45:53] church of the living god this morning
[45:55] lays the power to overcome every
[45:58] temptation
[46:01] in the possession of the church of the
[46:03] living god this morning lays the power
[46:06] to chain sin oh i like how he put that
[46:10] to chain sin where sin was had a chain
[46:12] around you there came an anointing and
[46:14] it broke that yoke off of you and now in
[46:16] the church of the living god this
[46:18] morning is that power to change sin
[46:21] and throw it away
[46:24] notice the power to change sin and throw
[46:27] it away and recede the baptism of the
[46:31] holy ghost in the church
[46:33] of jesus
[46:35] christ
[46:36] in the church of jesus christ and he
[46:39] goes on and he says whatsoever you
[46:42] desire
[46:44] whatsoever you desire
[46:45] ask in my name and it shall be given to
[46:49] you
[46:50] remember our focus tonight is what are
[46:52] you going to do
[46:57] what are you going to do
[46:59] see he says now he goes on to say in
[47:01] this message possessing of the enemy's
[47:03] gates he says i will verify myself that
[47:06] i am with you
[47:08] for these signs shall follow them that
[47:11] believe
[47:13] mark 16 and verse 15 and he said unto
[47:15] him go you into all the world preach the
[47:17] gospel to every creature he that
[47:20] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[47:22] but he that believeth not shall be
[47:24] damned and notice verse 17
[47:28] verse 17 here and these signs
[47:32] shall follow them that believe
[47:36] these signs shall follow them that
[47:38] believe in my name they shall cast out
[47:41] devils
[47:42] they shall speak with new tongues
[47:44] keep going on he says and they shall
[47:46] take up serpents if they drink any
[47:47] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[47:50] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[47:52] shall recover so then after the lord had
[47:55] spoken unto them he was received up into
[47:58] heaven and he sat down on the right hand
[48:00] of god and noticed and they went forth
[48:04] they went forth and preached everywhere
[48:08] their life manifested the gospel
[48:10] everywhere they went and the lord
[48:12] working with them and confirming the
[48:15] word with signs
[48:18] following glory
[48:21] oh i love this
[48:23] i love this
[48:25] brother joe you're just an emotional
[48:26] type well i'm sorry i love this
[48:29] there's gonna be signs following the
[48:31] true believer
[48:32] there's times to follow the true
[48:34] believer so let me just tell you
[48:36] spoiler alert if your message or your
[48:38] ministry or your church don't have any
[48:40] signs following i wonder if there's a
[48:42] true ministry there i wonder where the
[48:44] holy ghost is because the scripture says
[48:47] that these signs shall follow the
[48:49] believer
[48:51] there's going to be healing there's
[48:52] going to be deliverance there's going to
[48:53] be casting out of them there's going to
[48:55] be speaking in tongues there's going to
[48:57] be a holy ghost anointing on the people
[48:59] there's going to be some emotion
[49:03] these signs shall follow the believer
[49:09] notice and he says now
[49:11] preach the gospel unto all the world and
[49:13] these signs shall follow them
[49:16] onto all the world everywhere this
[49:19] note he says everywhere this same sign
[49:22] the same gospel will be preached he says
[49:25] we passed out tracts all around the
[49:26] world but the gospel hasn't been
[49:28] preached one-third of it yet the gospel
[49:31] is not just the word only but it's the
[49:33] word made manifest
[49:37] see the power and the demonstration of
[49:39] the holy spirit bringing the word to
[49:42] pass
[49:44] then there's great lectures
[49:47] they can stand up here and they can
[49:48] preach
[49:49] they can read they got a human mind they
[49:52] can pull scriptures together they can
[49:54] take a concordance and tie this
[49:55] scripture to that scripture and look at
[49:57] the history and say it means this and it
[49:59] means that but that's not what we're
[50:00] asking that's not what we're talking
[50:02] about we're talking about a holy ghost
[50:05] anointing that when that word goes forth
[50:08] it does something to the hearer it
[50:10] sparks a faith inside that heart that i
[50:13] can be healed that i am healed i don't
[50:15] have to stay about i am delivered
[50:18] it preaches look liberty to those that
[50:20] were captive it breaks every yoke of sin
[50:23] and unbelief that's what preaching the
[50:25] gospel does for the believer
[50:28] not standing up here and saying i need
[50:30] you to turn to this scripture here and
[50:32] you know you can just listen to a big
[50:34] lecture and my all his intellect and
[50:36] everything and you think oh wow
[50:39] how fascinating he's so intelligent
[50:42] but if his ministry is not producing
[50:44] signs and wonders it's not of god
[50:49] sorry
[50:51] see the gospel is not just a word only
[50:54] but it's the word made manifest
[50:59] it's the power and demonstration of the
[51:01] holy spirit bringing the word to pass
[51:03] and the message is why am i praying for
[51:04] the sick he says but after all the
[51:06] passing out of tracks is not preaching
[51:08] the gospel the gospel came not in word
[51:10] only paul would say but through the
[51:12] power and demonstration of the holy
[51:15] ghost not just teach the word but preach
[51:18] make the word
[51:20] manifest that's what we want tonight
[51:23] you don't want brother timothy and
[51:25] brother aaron brother tim myself to
[51:27] stand up here and just preach to you
[51:29] some intellectual gospel that we just go
[51:31] through our 30 45 minutes some of us two
[51:33] hours of letting you hear this scripture
[51:35] and this quote and we just tie it all in
[51:38] and you leave out of here and he's like
[51:39] well i didn't get anything out of that
[51:40] but it was so pretty and it seemed to be
[51:42] put together so well and we grade the
[51:45] sermon based on all these key points and
[51:47] it does nothing for the inside let me
[51:50] tell you i don't care if that man knows
[51:52] how to say his abc's but the holy ghost
[51:54] can come behind it and signs and one is
[51:56] vindicated and the sick are healed and
[51:58] those that are bound are set free that's
[52:00] the kind of gospel i want i don't care
[52:02] if he's an intelligent man as long as
[52:04] he's got the holy ghost and the holy
[52:06] ghost is manifest and making that work
[52:08] come to be that's what we wanted even
[52:10] like tabernacle
[52:11] that's what we desire in our home we
[52:13] want the gospel preached
[52:15] signs and wonders manifesting in young
[52:18] people where sin had a whole sin had to
[52:21] give way because the holy ghost broke
[52:23] the yoke of sin off their lives
[52:28] oh hallelujah notice now the word itself
[52:30] excuse me is dead
[52:33] until it becomes into action
[52:35] this is in the india trip report
[52:38] he said the word itself is dead
[52:41] until it becomes in action and produces
[52:44] life
[52:45] but i got the bible
[52:47] but this is no good to you
[52:50] unless it's living through you
[52:53] do you hear me
[52:54] this is no but men lost their life
[52:56] because they manifested what was on the
[52:59] pages of this book
[53:00] you can take this book and throw it in a
[53:02] fire and go down to the store and buy
[53:04] the same exact copy
[53:07] but you take this book and put it on the
[53:10] heart on somebody who's on fire you
[53:12] can't burn it out of them
[53:15] no they'll give their life at the stake
[53:17] they'll die for this because why because
[53:19] it's not just pages or words on the
[53:22] pages of of a book it's a life that's
[53:24] being lived it's a life that's being
[53:26] manifest it's christ in word form
[53:29] becoming christ in flesh form it's no
[53:32] longer on the pages of a book it's no
[53:34] longer in the paint a history book now
[53:36] it's become a living god in a living
[53:39] people the word being made manifest unto
[53:42] an endtime people
[53:45] notice now
[53:46] he will say the word itself is dead
[53:49] until it becomes an action
[53:51] and produces life
[53:53] so the word must be made alive
[53:57] i ask you where is it going to be made
[54:00] alive tonight
[54:04] it can't live on the pages of this book
[54:07] because this book has no heartbeat this
[54:10] book has no life of its own
[54:13] it can't live in the past and we hear
[54:16] stories of what this one did and that
[54:18] one did those stories do you no good the
[54:21] only way that this book can be made
[54:23] alive or this word that can be made
[54:25] alive is for this word to come inside of
[54:28] that flesh and that flesh and that flesh
[54:31] and that flesh and manifest what this
[54:34] word declares that it will do what it
[54:36] says it will do
[54:40] he says now in the faith in action he
[54:42] says what good is going to what goes it
[54:45] going to do you to read of a historical
[54:47] god if he isn't the same god today
[54:52] what good is it going to read about old
[54:55] george washington if he's dead and gone
[54:57] it's just a history fact but jesus
[55:00] raised from the dead and he's the same
[55:02] today he says now what good is it going
[55:05] to do to paint a fire to a freezing man
[55:09] he's there shivering and we don't get
[55:11] very hard cold
[55:13] so you from uh canada you guys have just
[55:16] moved down here from the frozen north
[55:18] don't worry you're not gonna freeze down
[55:20] here
[55:21] it's not gonna get cold enough but you
[55:22] take a man up there and the snow's about
[55:24] six foot deep and you walk outside and
[55:27] it's 40 degrees below zero and you show
[55:28] him this beautiful picture of a fire
[55:31] that man don't want the pitcher
[55:33] he wants the fire
[55:35] and that's what i'm telling you tonight
[55:36] we don't want just lectures we don't
[55:38] want just people to stand behind the
[55:40] pulpit and can say this and say that we
[55:42] want the fire or the power of the living
[55:45] god manifest that's what's gonna warm
[55:47] this bride it ain't gonna be some story
[55:49] of yesterday but it's gonna be jesus
[55:51] christ today doing the very same thing
[55:54] in which he did yesterday
[55:59] he says now show him a picture of a nice
[56:01] big warm fire and that man's freezing
[56:04] that's some something that was he said
[56:06] that's what people are trying to keep
[56:07] you alive by today and i'm afraid that's
[56:10] what a lot of preachers are trying to
[56:11] keep us alive by today their their
[56:13] constituents
[56:15] is a god of 40 years ago
[56:17] what he did 40 years ago
[56:19] what about him today
[56:22] what about him today
[56:24] i'm thankful for a god that moved 40 50
[56:27] 60 years ago
[56:28] but i need a god today i need the same
[56:31] signs i need the same wonders i need the
[56:34] same power deliverance i need the same
[56:36] manifestation today your kids need the
[56:38] same manifestation today we can't just
[56:41] rely on a god of 40 and 50 years ago we
[56:43] need a personal god but i want you to
[56:45] know he's the same today
[56:48] he's the same god today he wasn't justin
[56:51] william branham he wasn't justin all
[56:53] these other men that was in the healing
[56:54] movement but he's in you this evening
[56:56] he's in your heart he's in your home
[56:59] he's in your life what is he doing
[57:01] brother he's bringing forth the word
[57:04] he's manifesting the gospel
[57:07] notice
[57:09] i'm afraid a lot of so-called message
[57:11] preachers have have failed to present
[57:13] the right thing brother bran will tell
[57:14] us this he goes that's what
[57:16] the people are trying to keep you alive
[57:18] by no wonder we got a failure in america
[57:20] of religion no one of the magazines
[57:22] serves as spiritual own go as a bust
[57:25] it's because they have failed to
[57:27] represent the right thing to them
[57:29] they're trying to teach them of a
[57:32] historical god
[57:35] and we find many people all this message
[57:38] is to them is god sent a prophet
[57:41] god sent a prophet god sent a prophet
[57:44] god sent a prophet god sent a prophet
[57:46] but who did he send that prophet to
[57:50] let's move past god sending the prophet
[57:52] and realized god sent a prophet yes but
[57:54] who did he send him to
[57:56] what purpose did he send him for we're
[57:59] going to get into that i'm glad you're
[58:01] asking all these great intuitive
[58:02] questions tonight so they can point you
[58:04] to a god 40 50 years ago
[58:06] but we can't get worn by a painted fire
[58:08] church
[58:10] oh it does your heart good to hear the
[58:13] tapes and listen to them and it serves
[58:14] your faith but what if he's not the same
[58:17] god today
[58:18] and all he is is a god of history a god
[58:21] of yesterday when you put on a 1962 or
[58:24] 63 because some people like it after the
[58:26] seal so let's go 63 march around 16 17
[58:29] and we'll say everything past that point
[58:31] to 65 is all inspired by god how
[58:33] shameful are we gotten when we've taken
[58:35] it and narrowed it down and nitpicked it
[58:37] like that
[58:38] either he was a prophet or he wasn't a
[58:39] prophet
[58:41] either he was called of god he wasn't
[58:43] called to god but yet they want to say
[58:44] this is what we are this is my painted
[58:47] fire let me tell you i don't want a
[58:48] painted fire i want the god of william
[58:50] branham manifesting an evil like
[58:52] tabernacle i want the god of william
[58:54] brown manifesting in timothy pruitt and
[58:56] aaron oglesby and tim pruitt and joe
[58:58] adams in your life in my life in others
[59:01] life i want that same god on display
[59:04] i don't want him in history i want to
[59:06] call that god tonight up out of history
[59:08] and said be my god be my deliverer be my
[59:12] healer be my burden bear be the one that
[59:14] takes me on to the rapture another
[59:16] church that's what i'm looking for
[59:21] we want a living god not some historical
[59:24] artifact
[59:25] a living god
[59:27] a god who's still healed saved set free
[59:30] he says but what we need today
[59:33] is a god resurrected from the dead
[59:36] and on the right hand now to do whatever
[59:38] he promised he would do to confirm his
[59:41] word
[59:41] and
[59:43] catch this
[59:44] and we need delegates
[59:47] out there in the audience who's willing
[59:49] to rest their soul on any word that god
[59:52] said and put
[59:54] it in action
[59:57] oh
[59:58] my
[59:59] you mean it's more than just the
[1:00:00] preachers we need delegates
[1:00:03] let me just put it to you like he would
[1:00:05] say if he was here we need even like
[1:00:08] tabernacle the church members
[1:00:10] from the very front to the very back we
[1:00:13] need each of you here that is willing to
[1:00:15] rest your soul on any word that god said
[1:00:19] and put it into action so let me tell
[1:00:22] you it's time we quit talking about it
[1:00:24] it's time we quit saying oh i wish i
[1:00:26] could or i wish i did it's time to you
[1:00:29] put this word into action
[1:00:34] he says what we need today
[1:00:36] that's what we need is men and women who
[1:00:38] stand up to the forefront there and call
[1:00:41] the devil a liar
[1:00:44] call the devil our say jesus christ
[1:00:46] stripped you and robbed you of every
[1:00:49] right you had and i'm in christ jesus
[1:00:51] and the world belongs to me amen that's
[1:00:54] right it's time that some young people
[1:00:57] so i'm tired of this pornography having
[1:00:59] a grip on my life or this anxiety or
[1:01:01] this fear or this nervousness i'm tired
[1:01:04] of you o devil you're nothing but a liar
[1:01:07] i'm in jesus christ and he's alive today
[1:01:09] and he's manifesting through my life
[1:01:12] that's what we need
[1:01:15] the devil said he's going to shut up a
[1:01:16] womb but god says i'm the one that gives
[1:01:18] life
[1:01:19] come on even the like tabernacle it's
[1:01:21] time we declare that he's alive
[1:01:25] i'm not saying that we don't declare it
[1:01:27] but i'm saying look let's just have a
[1:01:29] refresher
[1:01:30] he is alive
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:33] he's alive today faith in action 1955 he
[1:01:36] said he's alive today he's just saying
[1:01:38] jesus
[1:01:39] certainly he is
[1:01:42] if blind bartimaeus could trust him i
[1:01:45] can too
[1:01:46] if the woman with the blood is you can
[1:01:48] touch him touch his garment i can too
[1:01:52] see for he's open and willing and he's
[1:01:55] begging and accepting whosoever will let
[1:01:57] him come and drink
[1:01:59] are you thirsty tonight
[1:02:01] are you thirsty man i've been on a
[1:02:03] desert hot
[1:02:07] thirsty
[1:02:09] see this thirst won't quench but just
[1:02:10] for a few minutes
[1:02:12] but he can quench for a lifetime
[1:02:15] he can quench that deep desire
[1:02:18] so he lives today
[1:02:21] he said that's
[1:02:22] the way it is today you might send your
[1:02:25] seminary boys in there
[1:02:26] teach them all kinds of theology
[1:02:29] all about this and that and the other
[1:02:31] but if you're afraid to turn your faith
[1:02:33] loose to trust god
[1:02:35] what good does it to you
[1:02:38] what good does it do you to teach them
[1:02:41] he says what we need is to turn low he
[1:02:43] says what we need to turn loose is let
[1:02:45] your faith go into action
[1:02:48] and we're about to have some special
[1:02:50] meetings and sometimes we don't get
[1:02:52] excited some of us until it's our
[1:02:54] favorite preacher
[1:02:56] or it's a special meeting or we're going
[1:02:58] off somewhere and we're going to be a
[1:03:00] part of special meetings oh hit a nerve
[1:03:03] didn't i
[1:03:05] but he's the same god right here
[1:03:09] he's the same god i'm asking what are
[1:03:11] you going to do
[1:03:13] he's the same today what are you gonna
[1:03:16] do because that songwriter would would
[1:03:18] pin that song i can only imagine
[1:03:21] i can only imagine when i stand before
[1:03:23] him what am i gonna do i can tell you
[1:03:25] one thing i can get a prelim of how i
[1:03:27] act here i may do the very same thing
[1:03:29] over there they may see joe adams run
[1:03:32] over that hill and that hill and that
[1:03:33] and you know what spoiler alert i'm
[1:03:35] going to be able to sing on that side
[1:03:37] so you're going to find me not only
[1:03:38] dancing and running i'm going to be
[1:03:40] singing and shouting and praising god i
[1:03:42] can only imagine i know what i'm going
[1:03:44] to do i'm not going to sit by and let
[1:03:46] some rock climb my place i'm going to
[1:03:48] let some tree pray to my place i'm going
[1:03:50] to declare he's a living god
[1:03:53] he's a living manifested god and people
[1:03:56] today
[1:03:58] that's what i'm going to do i'm going to
[1:04:00] declare jesus christ is the same
[1:04:03] he's the same in principle he's the same
[1:04:05] in power he's the same in manifestation
[1:04:08] he's a saving spirit and he's here
[1:04:10] tonight i declare to you tonight church
[1:04:15] i'm not preaching a godly history i'm
[1:04:17] preaching about a present tense god
[1:04:23] he says you need
[1:04:25] to turn because what we need to turn
[1:04:28] loose is let your faith
[1:04:30] go into action
[1:04:32] he says now as shakespeare lived in me
[1:04:35] you would expect me to live like
[1:04:36] shakespeare to write poems and
[1:04:39] plays and things of that nature if
[1:04:41] beethoven lived in you you would be a
[1:04:43] great composer
[1:04:45] that beethoven was because beethoven
[1:04:47] lives in you
[1:04:48] you're not yourself now you're beethoven
[1:04:50] or your shakespeare
[1:04:52] but he said then if christ lives in you
[1:04:55] young people check up
[1:04:57] sometimes you think you get something
[1:04:59] and you don't have what you think you
[1:05:00] have
[1:05:01] but if the holy spirit truly lives in
[1:05:03] you
[1:05:04] then the life of christ he says that's
[1:05:07] just the way he lives in you but you
[1:05:09] can't live in there with him he's got to
[1:05:12] live in you
[1:05:15] see the difference you can't just live
[1:05:17] in him
[1:05:18] but he's got to come and live in you and
[1:05:20] when he lives in you he's going to
[1:05:22] manifest his word through you
[1:05:25] then the things that you used to look at
[1:05:27] you look at no more the things that you
[1:05:30] used to fear fear's been broken off of
[1:05:32] you because now the one who gives you
[1:05:35] overcoming power is no longer out there
[1:05:38] he's inside of here and now fear that
[1:05:40] once had you bound here is no longer
[1:05:42] there because there's a power here to
[1:05:44] break every yoke because he's not a dead
[1:05:47] god and he's not just a letter he's a
[1:05:49] living god
[1:05:55] notice mark 24 14
[1:06:00] the gospel of the kingdom shall be
[1:06:01] preached
[1:06:02] in all the world for a witness
[1:06:05] unto all nations and then
[1:06:07] shall the income the gospel of the
[1:06:09] kingdom
[1:06:11] the gospel
[1:06:12] clue on these key words tonight
[1:06:15] the gospel of the kingdom shall be
[1:06:16] manifested the word
[1:06:19] shall be made alive
[1:06:21] not just in louisiana
[1:06:24] not just in tennessee
[1:06:26] not just in virginia
[1:06:28] ohio but into all the world the gospel
[1:06:31] of the kingdom
[1:06:32] shall be
[1:06:34] preached
[1:06:35] manifested
[1:06:37] demonstrated
[1:06:39] declare him to be the same
[1:06:43] so in the message missionary talk 1958
[1:06:45] brother says now what is the gospel the
[1:06:48] word gospel means good news
[1:06:51] he said the good news is the bible but
[1:06:53] the bible is the letter and the letter
[1:06:55] killeth but the spirit giveth life so
[1:06:58] the only way that the gospel could be
[1:07:01] preached in would be to manifest the
[1:07:03] power of the holy spirit
[1:07:06] all right y'all following me tonight
[1:07:08] he says so then what's the next equation
[1:07:11] he said and as a conjunction and these
[1:07:14] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:07:18] not these signs may
[1:07:19] follow them
[1:07:21] not these signs ought to follow them but
[1:07:23] they shall follow them that believe
[1:07:27] he says then strictly speaking 1958
[1:07:30] march the 30th
[1:07:32] so the critics can go back to this
[1:07:34] because this is not brother joseph is
[1:07:35] the prophet of god he said then strictly
[1:07:37] speaking a man cannot qualify himself as
[1:07:41] a believer until this has happened
[1:07:46] until what the signs
[1:07:48] follow the believer
[1:07:50] so we can't qualify that we are a
[1:07:53] believer until signs and wonders are
[1:07:56] fine now i'm not saying everybody's
[1:07:57] going to be supernatural
[1:07:59] no but you're going to manifest this
[1:08:00] word
[1:08:02] you're going to believe this where
[1:08:03] you're not going to live a life
[1:08:05] that's hypocritical to the word of god
[1:08:06] your life is going to manifest all the
[1:08:09] promises of god
[1:08:10] you're not going to pro
[1:08:12] uh
[1:08:14] claim that you're this that and the
[1:08:15] other and you got some old crappy spirit
[1:08:19] are you some negative nancy or some
[1:08:21] debbie downer and i'll give you a few
[1:08:22] other names if y'all want them
[1:08:25] but no
[1:08:27] the gospel is joy unspeakable
[1:08:30] let me just tell you a story can i tell
[1:08:31] you all story yeah i can tell you story

[1:08:34] floor for 49 more minutes

[1:09:15] to be around me because i'm old crappy
[1:09:17] joke
[1:09:19] [Laughter]
[1:09:21] and that was a little emphatic amen

[1:09:27] well
[1:09:29] the truth hurts right
[1:09:31] my wife with us you did that for her
[1:09:34] yeah
[1:09:35] so i come home almost like every day for
[1:09:37] months and i just begin to say lord
[1:09:40] something's got to change
[1:09:41] well i woke up one morning in my
[1:09:43] devotion and i began to pray said god if
[1:09:45] you want me to stay at this hospital
[1:09:47] i've been there 23 years if you want me
[1:09:48] to remain at this hospital that i can
[1:09:50] make a difference in this hospital help
[1:09:51] this hospital turn the corner and be
[1:09:53] there to provide health care for our
[1:09:55] community in places where my family
[1:09:57] members my church members can come and
[1:09:58] receive good patient care then you got
[1:10:01] to take the stress away from me
[1:10:04] i began to pray directly specifically
[1:10:06] you say brother joe what are you going
[1:10:07] to do i had the promise i had the word
[1:10:09] of god ask what you willing to be given
[1:10:11] and i sat back and i was expecting god
[1:10:14] to do it all
[1:10:16] right and i began to say god
[1:10:18] if you want me there you've got to take
[1:10:20] this away let me move beyond the realm
[1:10:22] of stress
[1:10:24] and so i was down my sister jessica and
[1:10:27] i were preaching for brother danny
[1:10:28] steeman a couple months back and as i
[1:10:29] was preaching at the end i was bringing
[1:10:31] it to a close
[1:10:33] and i said something in the end of that
[1:10:35] service
[1:10:36] and i said
[1:10:38] that job situation that has you stressed
[1:10:40] out
[1:10:41] for so long and you can't get along with
[1:10:43] your family today is its last day
[1:10:46] and when i said that i promised y'all
[1:10:48] the spirit of god hit me and me and
[1:10:50] jessica connected eyes and it left
[1:10:54] it left
[1:10:56] hear me church it left
[1:10:59] so much so
[1:11:02] that just about three weeks ago i got a
[1:11:04] text from one of our senior leaders she
[1:11:06] said are you okay
[1:11:10] i said yeah why you asked cause you sure
[1:11:12] been acting different lately
[1:11:15] i'm like what do you mean she says well
[1:11:17] you just kind of seem like you're
[1:11:18] checked out
[1:11:20] so i begin to tell the story i'm not
[1:11:21] checked out
[1:11:22] i just ain't got no more stress
[1:11:25] and then i had one of my direct reports
[1:11:27] call me on the phone i took off a
[1:11:28] thursday a couple weeks ago because
[1:11:30] brother j.j salinas and his wife was
[1:11:32] here and i want to spend a day with him
[1:11:34] and i was taken off she called me she
[1:11:36] says
[1:11:37] you ain't going job hunting are you
[1:11:40] i'm like no why you asked she goes
[1:11:42] because you've been acting so different
[1:11:44] lately
[1:11:46] she's like you just seem to be happy and
[1:11:48] like you ain't worried about nothing do
[1:11:49] you got another job somewhere
[1:11:52] and i began to tell her the story she
[1:11:53] said i got goosebumps too that just
[1:11:55] makes me feel so good
[1:11:57] so what am i telling you i'm saying we
[1:11:59] want god to do it but god was waiting on
[1:12:01] me to ask
[1:12:04] he wanted me to ask because the gospel
[1:12:06] is not just signs and wonders but it's
[1:12:08] the things that you have need of
[1:12:10] god's able god's willing to take care of
[1:12:13] those needs if it's a job situation he's
[1:12:16] still jehovah jireh
[1:12:18] he still provides and now today i ain't
[1:12:21] got no cash in the bank and i still got
[1:12:22] a smile on my face i said i don't know
[1:12:25] how we're gonna do it but bless god if
[1:12:27] he can break two fishes and five loaves
[1:12:29] and feed five thousand he'd steal god
[1:12:31] for even like tabernacle he still can
[1:12:33] feed my family he still can provide for
[1:12:35] my family he's still able i'm going to
[1:12:38] tell you tonight he's still god and he
[1:12:40] does the impossibility you got a need
[1:12:42] tonight he's the need supplying god oh
[1:12:45] hallelujah he's a need supplying god and
[1:12:49] nothing here be church nothing is
[1:12:52] impossible if you can take god at his
[1:12:54] word
[1:12:57] oh yes
[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:00] these signs shall follow them they can
[1:13:04] go in on the hospital morning
[1:13:06] no cash in the bank
[1:13:08] 12 million dollars in debt and say all
[1:13:10] right i'm glad to be here
[1:13:14] oh yeah
[1:13:16] my corporate office may not like that
[1:13:18] but whatever
[1:13:21] we got the wrong man in the job
[1:13:26] i said we can find somebody better
[1:13:28] please
[1:13:29] come on
[1:13:30] i don't think there's anybody better
[1:13:31] right now
[1:13:33] god put me there
[1:13:36] so we fine
[1:13:38] i heard brother ron speak this if y'all
[1:13:40] listen to his third part
[1:13:42] of his series that he just finished
[1:13:44] he says now these men who don't want
[1:13:46] archer calls these men who don't want
[1:13:48] prayer lines these men who don't want
[1:13:50] any emotion in the church no speaking in
[1:13:52] tongues these men
[1:13:54] don't have the holy ghost
[1:14:00] see if you don't believe i like how you
[1:14:02] said if you don't believe in the product
[1:14:05] then you can't sell it
[1:14:11] so if you don't believe in the holy
[1:14:13] ghost
[1:14:15] then you can't sell the holy ghost
[1:14:19] if you don't believe in a little bit of
[1:14:21] emotion that the holy ghost brings when
[1:14:23] the power of bondage is broken off
[1:14:26] somebody's life then you can't sell it
[1:14:28] to that congregation when you don't
[1:14:30] believe that he's still the same today
[1:14:32] you can't sell it to the people and the
[1:14:35] people sit there dan is midnight but if
[1:14:38] you can sell it because you believe it
[1:14:40] because it's manifested and it becomes a
[1:14:42] living gospel saying you can sell it to
[1:14:44] the young you can sell it to the old you
[1:14:47] can sell it to the sick you can sell it
[1:14:48] to the bank and it'll break the chains
[1:14:51] off their life
[1:14:56] branham would tell us like this in the
[1:14:57] horizon of the sun he said the very
[1:14:58] message of the gospel itself is to prove
[1:15:01] to the people that he is risen
[1:15:04] amen
[1:15:06] to prove that he is risen
[1:15:10] can we prove that he has risen
[1:15:12] if there's nothing flowing
[1:15:14] from our ministries
[1:15:15] from our life
[1:15:17] if there's no signs
[1:15:19] of life
[1:15:21] how can we prove and declare brothers
[1:15:23] that he's risen
[1:15:27] if there's no signs there's no wonders
[1:15:28] there's no tongue there's no
[1:15:30] supernatural display of the spirit
[1:15:32] see
[1:15:33] but i'm here to declare tonight he's not
[1:15:35] dead but he is alive
[1:15:37] and this church has witnessed one
[1:15:38] miracle after another one supernatural
[1:15:41] occurrence after another one healing
[1:15:44] after another discernment after another
[1:15:47] because why the gospel is being preached
[1:15:51] it's being manifested
[1:15:55] brother would tell us the word of god
[1:15:58] made manifest
[1:16:00] is
[1:16:01] the gospel
[1:16:03] he said you're you're
[1:16:04] hankering down on that one or anchoring
[1:16:06] down on that one tonight i'm kind of
[1:16:07] like brother brother aaron priest to
[1:16:09] y'all this power to us this past sunday
[1:16:11] i'm going to preach it to you till you
[1:16:13] get it
[1:16:14] remember what brother tim said years ago
[1:16:15] when i first started he goes i'm going
[1:16:17] to keep repeating and repeating and
[1:16:18] repeating because some of you will not
[1:16:20] learn unless you hear it repeated and
[1:16:22] repeated and repeated you know there is
[1:16:24] a difference between the word the word
[1:16:26] is the logos right
[1:16:28] it's the word that was spoken right
[1:16:31] but what is the gospel it's the same
[1:16:33] word but it's in a different
[1:16:34] manifestation the gospel is that logos
[1:16:37] now coming into action and your life
[1:16:41] manifesting what the word says but being
[1:16:44] lived out that's the gospel that's what
[1:16:46] we're to preach we're not just to preach
[1:16:48] the word but preach the manifestation of
[1:16:51] the word so that the sick can be healed
[1:16:54] we can lay hands on the sick and the
[1:16:56] lame will jump up and walk
[1:17:00] what is it when a little girl comes here
[1:17:02] bound with a spirit
[1:17:04] you take her into another room
[1:17:07] and you've been anointed for the
[1:17:08] challenge and you walk her back across
[1:17:11] the stage a free person
[1:17:14] amen that ain't the word that's the
[1:17:16] gospel
[1:17:18] the word declares
[1:17:20] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:17:23] the gospel put that word into action
[1:17:25] and now that young girl's free
[1:17:27] from that spirit
[1:17:29] that's the word i'm preaching to you
[1:17:33] i'm not trying to dissect and split and
[1:17:35] say they're too different it's the same
[1:17:37] one but it has a different manifestation
[1:17:40] the gospel is the word living in human
[1:17:43] lives
[1:17:44] he says now the word may manifest is the
[1:17:47] gospel the gospel came to us not through
[1:17:50] word only but through power and
[1:17:52] demonstration of the holy ghost now the
[1:17:55] message five definition
[1:17:57] five definite identifications of a true
[1:17:59] church of the living god he said the
[1:18:01] gospel is the power of god to make the
[1:18:04] word act what it says it will do
[1:18:08] do you hear me church
[1:18:11] all right it's the gospel it's the power
[1:18:13] of god to make the word act what it says
[1:18:17] it would otherwise it's putting this
[1:18:19] word off of print and putting it in the
[1:18:22] flesh and making this flesh obey the
[1:18:25] word and come subject to it and manifest
[1:18:27] exactly what's on the printed page
[1:18:34] he says now this is in the message faith
[1:18:36] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:18:38] because when i was in when i was i
[1:18:39] landed in india
[1:18:41] the methodist bishop and many of them
[1:18:43] came out there to meet me and they said
[1:18:45] brother branham we've heard
[1:18:47] we've heard of these things we preached
[1:18:49] a word we know more about theology
[1:18:51] perhaps and all you americans put
[1:18:52] together because the bible is an eastern
[1:18:55] book
[1:18:56] he goes and that's right he said but we
[1:18:58] want to see someone anointed with the
[1:19:00] holy ghost that can make it live again
[1:19:05] he said that's it we want somebody who
[1:19:07] can produce what the bible says it will
[1:19:10] do
[1:19:11] he says we otherwise we want to see the
[1:19:13] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:19:15] saints
[1:19:17] and i believe
[1:19:18] that that's what we want here tonight
[1:19:21] we want somebody who's anointed with the
[1:19:23] holy ghost to make the word act what it
[1:19:26] says it will do
[1:19:28] not just in the young
[1:19:30] but in the old
[1:19:32] in the sick
[1:19:35] in those that are bound
[1:19:37] somebody that'll grab hold to this word
[1:19:39] and make it act
[1:19:41] make it manifest no matter what kind of
[1:19:43] trial you're in no matter what kind of
[1:19:45] dark situation you're in
[1:19:47] make this word manifest i was reading
[1:19:49] this morning had daniel begin to pray
[1:19:52] and for 21 days it seemed like god
[1:19:54] didn't answer his prayer
[1:19:57] but then the spirit came or the angel
[1:19:59] came and said i was held up by the
[1:20:01] prince of persia
[1:20:03] but daniel on that first moment when you
[1:20:05] went before god and started praying i
[1:20:08] heard you and i was coming i want you to
[1:20:10] know young person i want you to know
[1:20:11] church he's the same god today your
[1:20:14] prayer hasn't gone unanswered
[1:20:16] you hold on because in just a moment's
[1:20:18] time that prayer is going to manifest
[1:20:20] through your life
[1:20:23] i believe that we are a people that's
[1:20:25] been anointed with the holy ghost to
[1:20:27] make this word live
[1:20:30] notice the prophet of god say the gospel
[1:20:32] will take effect on anything that you
[1:20:33] preach he goes i've seen a baffle of
[1:20:34] bull
[1:20:36] amen i've seen it cause hornets not to
[1:20:38] sting
[1:20:39] now
[1:20:41] i'm not even gonna go there i'm just
[1:20:42] gonna move on
[1:20:43] we know what bulls do we know how tough
[1:20:45] they are and how rambunctious they are
[1:20:47] and how powerful they are but the gospel
[1:20:49] preached to a bull
[1:20:50] make it turn around
[1:20:52] and go back and lay down
[1:20:55] you ever been stung by a hornet it ain't
[1:20:57] fun
[1:20:58] don't go picking a fight with a hornet
[1:21:00] you're going to lose every time
[1:21:02] but when you preach the gospel to the
[1:21:03] hornet it flies right on wave at you
[1:21:05] with his little wings
[1:21:09] seeing the gospel will take an effect he
[1:21:10] goes i've seen it raise up a possum been
[1:21:13] laying dead all night he said every
[1:21:15] creature jesus preached to a tree
[1:21:18] and some of y'all look like trees
[1:21:19] tonight
[1:21:21] you're just standing there or sitting
[1:21:23] there just kind of stuck and stiff and
[1:21:25] it's wednesday night i get it it's been
[1:21:27] a long day for most of us
[1:21:29] but he preached the gospel to the tree
[1:21:31] and the tree obeyed the gospel
[1:21:34] he said so we can preach and he says now
[1:21:36] in john 14 and verse 19 yet a little
[1:21:38] while the world sees me no more but you
[1:21:40] shall see me because i live you shall
[1:21:43] live also he goes at that day you should
[1:21:45] know that i am in the father ye and me
[1:21:48] and i and you and in the message jehovah
[1:21:50] jireh the prophet of god will tell us my
[1:21:52] contentions is this is that jesus christ
[1:21:55] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:21:58] the bible says so jesus when he was here
[1:22:00] on earth he claimed that he was going to
[1:22:02] turn back to the father again in the
[1:22:04] form of the spirit but when he come in
[1:22:05] the form of the holy ghost he would
[1:22:07] abide with us forever and the very same
[1:22:10] works that he did he would do through
[1:22:13] the church until he'd come again
[1:22:17] what are you going to do
[1:22:20] how are you going to act what are you
[1:22:22] going to display is your life going to
[1:22:25] manifest the gospel
[1:22:28] he says a little while the world the
[1:22:29] church world worldly minded not seed
[1:22:33] church members and so forth will not see
[1:22:35] me he said did the church members
[1:22:37] actually see him in that day says no sir
[1:22:39] they'd never seen him in the light of
[1:22:41] who he was they seen the corporal body
[1:22:43] because they had a sense of sight those
[1:22:45] who could see he said they saw him him
[1:22:48] in light of his human being but they
[1:22:50] didn't see him in light of the son of
[1:22:52] god because they said he was a devil he
[1:22:54] was a mind reader who's the bells above
[1:22:56] chief of the fortune tellers but there
[1:22:57] were some people
[1:22:59] then who believed him
[1:23:01] and he said they were called the common
[1:23:03] people
[1:23:04] say hey common folks
[1:23:07] the bible says blessed are your eyes for
[1:23:09] they see
[1:23:10] and your ears for they hear
[1:23:13] for many prophets and sages have longed
[1:23:17] to hear this message
[1:23:19] and to see this manifestation of all
[1:23:22] those mysteries now being unfolded tied
[1:23:25] together all the loose ends on display
[1:23:29] don't you see the seat that you occupy
[1:23:31] is a special seat for a special class of
[1:23:34] people not everybody can take your seat
[1:23:38] it's a special group church as brother
[1:23:41] tim put it a few services ago it's for a
[1:23:43] prophetic class of people
[1:23:46] he may have drug in here all beat down
[1:23:48] just realize you're a prophetic class of
[1:23:50] people
[1:23:52] prophetic class of people
[1:23:54] see the world can't see him the church
[1:23:55] systems don't see him what they see is a
[1:23:57] god or two or a man of 2000 years ago
[1:23:59] they did some great things but they
[1:24:01] failed to see him in the form in which
[1:24:04] he's in today
[1:24:06] and i'm afraid many message preachers
[1:24:08] and churches fail to see the form that
[1:24:11] he's in today
[1:24:13] let me just kind of go forward here
[1:24:14] because i know i don't have much time
[1:24:16] left but i want to get to some
[1:24:17] highlights here
[1:24:19] willa brown says now don't you see the
[1:24:20] authority of the living god living in
[1:24:22] the church the bride the sick are healed
[1:24:25] not in a prophet in the bride i'm not
[1:24:28] trying to take your attention off of a
[1:24:30] prophet don't please don't think that
[1:24:32] but i want our thinking to be on we have
[1:24:34] a ministry we have a purpose we have a
[1:24:37] calling and that's to make this word
[1:24:39] manifest the gospel he says now don't
[1:24:42] you see the authority of the living god
[1:24:44] in the living church to bride the sick
[1:24:46] are healed the dead are raised the
[1:24:48] cripples walk the blind sea the gospel
[1:24:50] goes forth in its power for the message
[1:24:53] and the messenger are the same the word
[1:24:55] is in the church in the person there it
[1:24:58] is right there there's the church
[1:25:00] there's the word it's in the person
[1:25:02] manifesting and the sick are healed
[1:25:07] and the dead are raised those who were
[1:25:10] dead and sins and trespasses raised to
[1:25:11] the newness of life
[1:25:14] notice now when elijah
[1:25:17] when elijah said it wasn't going to rain
[1:25:18] that was god speaking through elijah
[1:25:21] when joshua stopped the sun and said son
[1:25:23] you stand still that was god manifesting
[1:25:25] through joshua
[1:25:27] and when you have a need and you speak
[1:25:29] it
[1:25:30] that's not you and your human need
[1:25:32] that's god the gospel manifesting
[1:25:35] through you for that
[1:25:38] need now here's what i want you to
[1:25:41] clinch down on can i go i'm going to go
[1:25:43] a few more minutes i'm not going to say
[1:25:45] it again because i was told last time
[1:25:47] joe daddy papa brother joe you closed
[1:25:51] five times before you finally closed
[1:25:54] well five is the number of whatever man
[1:25:57] grace
[1:25:59] it's one of them it's a number
[1:26:05] i'm not gonna say it again we're gonna
[1:26:06] end on three because three is perfection
[1:26:09] so we find here 1962 the spoken word is
[1:26:12] the original seed
[1:26:14] y'all want to hear this quote
[1:26:16] come on give me a hearty amen all right
[1:26:18] that's good he says my mission this is
[1:26:21] the prophet of god my mission i believe
[1:26:24] to the earth is what is to forerun the
[1:26:27] coming word see the coming word which is
[1:26:32] christ
[1:26:33] and christ in him has the millennium and
[1:26:36] has everything right there because he is
[1:26:38] a word but he says my mission
[1:26:40] i believe to the earth is to what is to
[1:26:43] forerun the coming word now we find john
[1:26:47] the baptist four ran the first coming of
[1:26:50] the word jesus christ in in groom form
[1:26:53] and yet the prophet of god is
[1:26:55] forerunning the coming word again but
[1:26:57] now it's not in groom form it's in bride
[1:27:00] form so what was the prophet sent for he
[1:27:03] was consent to forerun your coming
[1:27:06] so that that same word would manifest in
[1:27:09] laodicea it would raise the people up
[1:27:12] above the darkness of laodicea and they
[1:27:14] will live above sin
[1:27:17] he's forerunning our coming
[1:27:19] christ in bright form
[1:27:25] oh if it's christ in bright form then
[1:27:28] why are we all in our lousy wows he
[1:27:30] moves
[1:27:33] recognize
[1:27:34] this day
[1:27:36] this scripture
[1:27:38] is
[1:27:39] fulfilled
[1:27:40] i've been anointed brother joe to preach
[1:27:43] the gospel to declare it in the school
[1:27:46] declare it on the job declare when i go
[1:27:48] to walmart declare to this unregenerated
[1:27:50] generation i'm declared that the gospel
[1:27:53] live jesus christ is the same and i'm
[1:27:55] his representative i'm an ambassador
[1:27:57] i've been called by the lamb of god to
[1:27:59] be changed in the moment and the
[1:28:01] twinkling of a lot and ain't no devil in
[1:28:03] hell can stop god's purpose for my life

[1:28:11] word
[1:28:14] heath for ran your coming
[1:28:17] he's preached the message
[1:28:19] and what a great message we got we
[1:28:21] cannot separate the message from the
[1:28:24] messenger
[1:28:26] and the prophet of god will tell us
[1:28:28] you become the word as you receive the
[1:28:30] word
[1:28:32] and the more that we receive this
[1:28:33] message and receive this word the more
[1:28:35] we become christ's life because christ
[1:28:37] is the message
[1:28:39] it's not brother branham's idea
[1:28:41] but it's christ it's his mind
[1:28:44] see he says now we didn't come to talk
[1:28:46] about the message we didn't come to he
[1:28:48] says we are come to together to get in
[1:28:50] the message
[1:28:52] that's the message of christ and he is
[1:28:53] the word he goes i challenge you to
[1:28:55] believe
[1:28:56] that jesus christ is revealed in the
[1:28:59] form of the son of man in human flesh
[1:29:02] through the bride's body
[1:29:07] i challenge you
[1:29:09] to believe notice that jesus christ is
[1:29:13] revealed in the form of the son of man
[1:29:16] in human flesh
[1:29:18] but brother joe i got up this morning i
[1:29:20] didn't feel saved
[1:29:22] i challenge you to believe
[1:29:25] that jesus christ is revealed in your
[1:29:28] human failures
[1:29:31] he's revealed in you
[1:29:37] he
[1:29:38] the perfect word
[1:29:40] is being revealed in your fallen
[1:29:42] humanity
[1:29:45] what a god we serve
[1:29:47] he looked beyond your inconsistencies he
[1:29:50] looked beyond your failures he looked
[1:29:52] beyond your crabbiness and your ups and
[1:29:55] your downs and he says i'm going to
[1:29:57] manifest through that vessel
[1:30:00] i'm going to come i'm going to
[1:30:02] tabernacle i'm going to dwell not on
[1:30:04] that i'm going to manifest what my word
[1:30:07] declares through that life
[1:30:09] i'm gonna have young people that's gonna
[1:30:11] break the back of sin
[1:30:13] i'm gonna have young men who's gonna
[1:30:14] break the back of sin
[1:30:16] gonna rise and be some of these young
[1:30:18] men are to be preachers one day deacons
[1:30:20] one day but nevertheless they're going
[1:30:22] to be holy ghost field pillars in the
[1:30:24] church
[1:30:26] oh i'm talking about a gospel
[1:30:28] that's going forth
[1:30:32] you know peter and john they went to the
[1:30:34] gate called beautiful and there was a
[1:30:35] man there lame he'd been lame for many
[1:30:37] years
[1:30:39] and no doubt he wanted something give me
[1:30:40] some money i need to buy food my
[1:30:42] family's starving this that another and
[1:30:44] peter looked at me says silver and gold
[1:30:45] have i none but such as i have
[1:30:48] today is your lucky day
[1:30:50] because i'm giving it to you
[1:30:52] well what do you got i'd be like some of
[1:30:54] us you got five dollars ten dollars no i
[1:30:57] ain't got silver and i don't have gold
[1:30:59] but what i have
[1:31:01] is i have the healer living on the
[1:31:02] inside of me
[1:31:04] and he said he took him by his right
[1:31:06] hand lifted him up and his ankle bones
[1:31:09] immediately
[1:31:10] came together
[1:31:12] what is it i'm talking about a gospel
[1:31:14] peter and john not only lived with jesus
[1:31:16] they not only walked with jesus but they
[1:31:18] met the same jesus that they walked with
[1:31:20] in the upper room and they were endued
[1:31:22] with power and when they came to that
[1:31:24] old crippled man they didn't have silver
[1:31:26] they didn't have gold they didn't have a
[1:31:28] fancy car but they had the holy ghost on
[1:31:30] the inside and that holy ghost had a
[1:31:32] power to raise a lame man up and the
[1:31:34] bible said that he rose to his feet
[1:31:37] leaping and praising god what about it
[1:31:39] even like tabernacle you've been laying
[1:31:41] too long it's time to let me rise up and
[1:31:43] immediately receive strength to bring
[1:31:45] forth
[1:31:47] we serve a living god
[1:31:52] they knew that they had been with jesus
[1:31:55] they acted like jesus they preach like
[1:31:57] jesus they talk like jesus
[1:32:00] oh my when's the last time you've been
[1:32:01] mistaken for jesus
[1:32:03] don't answer that
[1:32:05] you'll be disappointed
[1:32:07] see
[1:32:08] oh my
[1:32:11] but paul would tell us
[1:32:12] for our gospel
[1:32:15] our gospel
[1:32:16] came not to you in word only but also in
[1:32:19] power and in the holy ghost
[1:32:21] see we have paul's gospel
[1:32:24] we're preaching paul's gospel
[1:32:28] we're living paul's gospel
[1:32:30] we're manifesting paul's gospel
[1:32:35] and we find
[1:32:36] what is that gospel gonna do
[1:32:38] that gospel is to bring forth life
[1:32:41] not lectures
[1:32:43] not pulpit clowns but life
[1:32:46] life
[1:32:47] life
[1:32:48] because this word is life and we find
[1:32:52] that word the word there means mechanics
[1:32:55] and he said the gospel came in power
[1:32:57] dynamics dunamis the power to bring
[1:33:00] forth miracles
[1:33:02] so otherwise it's the gospel in action
[1:33:05] paul's gospel
[1:33:07] had power dunamis
[1:33:09] it was a gospel it was an action it
[1:33:11] produced
[1:33:14] it healed it delivered it set free he
[1:33:16] says there's power
[1:33:18] he says there'll be a power put in the
[1:33:20] church
[1:33:21] and now it's coming in that the holy
[1:33:23] spirit was so anointed to people till
[1:33:26] they will speak the word and it'll
[1:33:27] create itself right there he says we
[1:33:30] haven't seen powers likes coming to the
[1:33:32] church for i know that for a fact you
[1:33:34] say unto this mountain be moved and not
[1:33:36] doubt in your heart but believe what you
[1:33:37] have said shall come to pass then you
[1:33:39] shall have whatsoever you had said see
[1:33:41] the placing of the church in position
[1:33:44] where the fullness of the power of the
[1:33:46] holy ghost comes into the church
[1:33:49] then he says the critic's mouths will
[1:33:51] shut
[1:33:53] i don't care what you say critic
[1:33:55] because you don't have what i have
[1:33:58] because if you had what i had you
[1:33:59] couldn't criticize what i got
[1:34:03] and until you get a taste of what i'm
[1:34:04] drinking you don't need to criticize
[1:34:08] see what the church needs say is not
[1:34:10] more words we got the word
[1:34:12] but we need to put the word in action
[1:34:15] we need to let our faith loose and let
[1:34:17] the word do what it says it would do
[1:34:21] see they don't want no movement of the
[1:34:22] spirit to drive people to the altar
[1:34:25] they don't want no new converts weeping
[1:34:27] their way to calvary those
[1:34:28] acts 2 38 screaming young as they don't
[1:34:30] want that anymore
[1:34:32] we've matured in the message now and all
[1:34:34] we need is the the word
[1:34:37] the word
[1:34:39] the letter killeth
[1:34:40] but it's the spirit the dunamis the
[1:34:43] gospel gives life to the word
[1:34:47] see if we're going to manifest christ
[1:34:49] then we can't be afraid to go back to
[1:34:51] pentecost
[1:34:53] not azusa but the upper room
[1:34:56] because it was in the upper room where
[1:34:58] they endued power
[1:35:00] and when they went to the markets the
[1:35:01] power went with them when they went to
[1:35:03] work the power went with them wherever
[1:35:05] they went they didn't leave the power in
[1:35:07] the upper room the power went with them
[1:35:10] it lived in them it sustained them
[1:35:12] everywhere the believer went the power
[1:35:14] was there to represent and declare what
[1:35:16] they said they had
[1:35:18] i'm asking you tonight church what are
[1:35:21] you
[1:35:22] going to do let me end it with this
[1:35:23] quote here and this is where i was
[1:35:24] trying to get to
[1:35:27] he said there's been churches churches
[1:35:28] brides brides but there has to come one
[1:35:33] there has to come a real bride
[1:35:37] see satan doesn't want you to realize
[1:35:39] that there's going to be one
[1:35:42] and you are that one
[1:35:44] so no matter how much mechanics prove to
[1:35:46] be right there has there's got to be the
[1:35:49] dynamics to make it work
[1:35:50] him being the groom
[1:35:53] the bride has to come forth because it's
[1:35:55] part of him it can only be the
[1:35:56] manifestation of the fulfilling of the
[1:35:58] revelations see he was the dynamics when
[1:36:01] he put his foot on the brow of the boat
[1:36:02] and said peace be still
[1:36:04] he was the dynamics when he stood at the
[1:36:06] grave of latter and said lather has come
[1:36:07] forth and a man who's been dead four
[1:36:09] days skin worms was in his body and he
[1:36:11] came walking out
[1:36:13] he was the dynamics when he cast demons
[1:36:15] out of legion he was the dynamics when
[1:36:17] he met a woman at the well and told her
[1:36:19] that she had five husbands and the one
[1:36:20] she was living with now is not her
[1:36:22] husband
[1:36:23] and maybe told them all their names and
[1:36:25] what they liked
[1:36:27] see he was the same dynamics
[1:36:30] when sister atlanta got down and ran
[1:36:32] around the church and was delivered a
[1:36:34] cancer
[1:36:35] same dynamics jesus christ the same
[1:36:37] today he was the same dynamics when
[1:36:39] sister candace and brother andrew
[1:36:41] received a touch in the womb to bring
[1:36:43] forth life
[1:36:45] same dynamics
[1:36:47] same dynamics from brother david dexter
[1:36:49] had a serious eye infection but god came
[1:36:51] down and healed
[1:36:52] same dynamics that touched drew dexter
[1:36:55] and a young boy who never had walked all
[1:36:56] of a sudden the spirit of god moved in
[1:36:58] the room and he raised up and he's not
[1:36:59] stopped walking since
[1:37:01] same dynamics
[1:37:04] not mechanics but the dynamics the
[1:37:07] gospel making the word manifest
[1:37:11] see the same dynamics that restore
[1:37:13] mariah's hair
[1:37:14] and it's the same dynamics that's in
[1:37:16] this church tonight
[1:37:18] and he tells us matthew 21 and 22 all
[1:37:21] things whatsoever you ask in prayer
[1:37:23] believing you shall receive
[1:37:26] john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you
[1:37:28] he that believeth on me in the works
[1:37:29] that i do shall he do also and greater
[1:37:31] works than thee shall he do because i go
[1:37:33] unto the father and whatsoever you shall
[1:37:35] ask in my name that will i do that the
[1:37:37] father may be glorified in the son if
[1:37:39] you ask anything in my name i will do it
[1:37:42] so we've been told to ask
[1:37:44] and i ask you tonight what are you going
[1:37:47] to do
[1:37:49] he's the same
[1:37:51] today
[1:37:53] and here's the quote that i wanted to
[1:37:55] get to and i promise you i'm ending
[1:37:59] on this
[1:38:01] brother branham was in
[1:38:03] la crescenta
[1:38:05] and there was a brother there was a
[1:38:06] preacher who had a four-month-old baby
[1:38:08] and this baby had cancer throat cancer
[1:38:11] and a doctor had performed a surgery on
[1:38:13] this baby and they split his throat he
[1:38:14] said he had a cut all the way around his
[1:38:16] throat trying to get the cancer out and
[1:38:18] the cancer moved from his throat from
[1:38:20] his jaws into his tongue and his tongue
[1:38:22] was swollen he says he says here he says
[1:38:25] now
[1:38:27] he goes i went to the hospital with him
[1:38:28] to see the baby and we walked in the
[1:38:30] room and he's right there next to the
[1:38:32] nurse's headquarters for the little baby
[1:38:33] just four months old he was born with a
[1:38:35] malignant tumor in the jaws which would
[1:38:37] swole out approximately that far from
[1:38:39] his face like that and just like that
[1:38:40] and the doctors had tried to operate and
[1:38:42] create big deep scars that cut all
[1:38:45] around his little throat all the way
[1:38:46] around it didn't stop he didn't stop it
[1:38:49] only run into his tongue and the little
[1:38:50] jaws hanging like that and deep big
[1:38:53] scars and his little tongue little mouth
[1:38:55] not over this big and his tongue
[1:38:58] probably swollen big and swollen and
[1:39:00] pushed out about like that and turned
[1:39:02] black and he shut off the breathing from
[1:39:04] his nostrils and coming down when it
[1:39:06] swelled up on the roof of his mouth and
[1:39:08] of course he could it cut his breath off
[1:39:10] from him they had to cut a hole in his
[1:39:11] throat
[1:39:12] and a little whistle they little little
[1:39:14] whistle-like thing they put in his
[1:39:15] throat little tin whistle there that's
[1:39:17] an awful situation ain't it imagine if
[1:39:19] this was your baby
[1:39:21] four-month-old malignant tumors cut all
[1:39:25] in his jaw swollen out tongue swollen
[1:39:27] out had to give him a tracheotomy
[1:39:28] because
[1:39:29] he couldn't breathe
[1:39:31] he said his little arms were in splints
[1:39:32] now they had his arms and splints so he
[1:39:34] wouldn't pull the tracheotomy out of his
[1:39:35] throat he said he couldn't reach he said
[1:39:37] so they have his arms and spent like
[1:39:39] this so that he couldn't reach and pull
[1:39:40] the whistle out he would choke and the
[1:39:42] cancer draining a nurse had to stand
[1:39:44] there with something to pull the
[1:39:46] drainage of the cancer out of the
[1:39:48] whistle or it would choke the little
[1:39:49] child
[1:39:50] and the father walked around to the
[1:39:52] bedside he says ricky daddy's little boy
[1:39:53] and he said daddy brought brother
[1:39:55] brandon to pray for you rick and he says
[1:39:57] when he said daddy's little boy my
[1:39:58] spirit just left me and i thought i
[1:40:00] couldn't stand any longer i just had to
[1:40:02] hold to the side of the bed daddy's
[1:40:03] little boy
[1:40:05] he goes i just couldn't speak you know i
[1:40:06] just kind of felt full and i just
[1:40:08] couldn't say anything and because i
[1:40:10] looked down i seen the little bitty
[1:40:11] hands out underneath the big splints and
[1:40:13] making a wheezing noise and i thought
[1:40:15] isn't that pitiful
[1:40:18] and after i kind of got around to myself
[1:40:20] enough to think i thought jesus do you
[1:40:23] mean that you get pleasure out of seeing
[1:40:25] that
[1:40:27] i can't believe it i just can't believe
[1:40:30] that you get glory out of the little
[1:40:32] baby suffering like that
[1:40:34] it just can't be if it makes me a sinner
[1:40:36] and feel like that that i do about that
[1:40:39] baby what ought to do to you
[1:40:41] as the all-resource of mercy what must
[1:40:44] it do
[1:40:45] to you
[1:40:46] now notice here's a prophet of god
[1:40:49] he had stood before many of people and
[1:40:51] pronounced healing
[1:40:53] but yet now he has seen this little
[1:40:55] child in this situation
[1:40:58] and notice he's
[1:41:00] awestruck
[1:41:01] he doesn't know what to do he goes and
[1:41:04] the nurse was standing there and i
[1:41:05] looked down at the little fella and i
[1:41:07] thought lord what would you do if you
[1:41:09] were standing here
[1:41:12] and now i realize that i'm in the pulpit
[1:41:13] and i realize that god is present but it
[1:41:15] seemed to me that something spoke down
[1:41:18] to my soul and said i'm waiting to see
[1:41:20] what you're going to do about it
[1:41:30] your situation
[1:41:32] your trial
[1:41:34] your sickness
[1:41:37] your dilemma
[1:41:39] god what are you gonna do about my
[1:41:40] situation
[1:41:43] i've given you the word i've declared
[1:41:45] that you are the word you're the bride
[1:41:47] of christ you're christ in bride form
[1:41:50] and now you are presented
[1:41:52] with the authority
[1:41:54] of the gospel to make that word live
[1:41:57] and here was god's representative
[1:42:00] his mouthpiece on earth and he looked
[1:42:02] down and said lord what are you going to
[1:42:04] do
[1:42:05] about it
[1:42:07] and he said the lord spoke to him
[1:42:08] dropped down on his own he goes i'm
[1:42:10] waiting to see what you're going to do
[1:42:11] about it i gave my authority to the
[1:42:13] church
[1:42:14] there you come back again to say to this
[1:42:17] mountain i gave my authority to the
[1:42:19] church and i'm waiting to see what
[1:42:21] you're going to do
[1:42:24] i wonder he says now i wonder if that's
[1:42:27] the attitude towards us all the time
[1:42:29] that he's waiting to see what we're
[1:42:31] going to do what about the signs of the
[1:42:33] time that we're just preaching about
[1:42:35] what would he do he's waiting to see
[1:42:38] what we're going to do
[1:42:42] he says now
[1:42:44] he goes well i got that little baby in
[1:42:45] my hand i just put his little fingers
[1:42:47] like this and it was so little and i
[1:42:49] said lord hear the prayer of your
[1:42:51] servant
[1:42:52] and by faith that i believe that you are
[1:42:55] i placed between this demon of cancer
[1:42:58] in this baby's life the blood of jesus
[1:43:00] christ
[1:43:01] between the killer and the baby the
[1:43:04] blood and by faith i placed that and i
[1:43:07] couldn't say nothing else i just turned
[1:43:10] around and started walking out
[1:43:12] he didn't have some big lab of prayer he
[1:43:14] didn't scream to the top of his lungs
[1:43:16] some of y'all probably wish i wouldn't
[1:43:17] as well but
[1:43:19] we all have different ministries
[1:43:20] but here he just
[1:43:22] prays a simple what seems to be a simple
[1:43:25] prayer but i believe he enter into the
[1:43:27] suffering of that little child
[1:43:30] father if it makes me a sinner
[1:43:33] feel the way i feel about this and how
[1:43:35] this demon has attacked this little
[1:43:37] child what about you and the spirit of
[1:43:39] the lord says what are you going to do
[1:43:40] about it and what did he do he put
[1:43:42] between that baby and that cancer the
[1:43:45] blood of jesus christ
[1:43:48] he says i went on to the house and in a
[1:43:50] matter of a few hours and another sermon
[1:43:52] he says two hours them jaws went down
[1:43:54] its tongue went back to the normal place
[1:43:56] and god healed that little fellow and
[1:43:57] they was removing the whistle the next
[1:43:59] morning and he went home
[1:44:02] what did he do he preached the gospel
[1:44:06] he preached the gospel in a prayer
[1:44:12] in a prayer and many times musicians you
[1:44:15] can come
[1:44:16] many times we're waiting on god to move
[1:44:20] some of you came to the service tonight
[1:44:21] waiting and expecting god to move
[1:44:25] to see what god's going to do how is god
[1:44:27] going to respond and maybe you're
[1:44:29] waiting till next weekend
[1:44:32] when we have such great ministry lined
[1:44:34] up brother wayne and brother donny and
[1:44:36] brother ron
[1:44:37] maybe you're waiting
[1:44:38] because your
[1:44:40] your nature gravitates to their ministry
[1:44:42] and you like that and that's fine
[1:44:44] but i'm asking you what are you going to
[1:44:45] do tonight
[1:44:48] you come tonight and maybe you got a
[1:44:50] nervous spirit seems to keep hanging
[1:44:51] around refuses to leave
[1:44:53] and you're waiting for god to do
[1:44:55] something
[1:44:57] maybe you came and you've been tormented
[1:44:59] by fear maybe anxiety maybe it's guilt
[1:45:01] of your past
[1:45:02] and you're waiting on god to move to
[1:45:04] deliver
[1:45:06] maybe you have health issues and
[1:45:08] it just just kind of seems to keep
[1:45:10] lingering and lingering and you've been
[1:45:12] wanting to be healed and you're
[1:45:13] expecting god and you're saying well
[1:45:15] maybe if i come to service tonight it's
[1:45:16] going to be my service god's going to do
[1:45:18] something
[1:45:19] but i want you to know god's here
[1:45:20] tonight
[1:45:23] and he's asking what are you going to do
[1:45:27] what are you going to do he's given you
[1:45:29] his spirit he's given you the authority
[1:45:31] to act in his name he's given you his
[1:45:33] word of promise he said whatsoever you
[1:45:36] ask in my name i will do it
[1:45:39] that tells me that he's ready to back up
[1:45:41] anything you have need of he's ready to
[1:45:45] bankrupt heaven
[1:45:47] before one promise of god falls to the
[1:45:48] ground
[1:45:50] do you not know that we are the final
[1:45:52] voice to the final age
[1:45:56] if we are that final voice and we got to
[1:45:58] give voice to the promise of god
[1:46:00] we got to give voice to healing we have
[1:46:03] to give voice to deliverance we got to
[1:46:05] give voice to the promises of god to
[1:46:07] make this gospel manifest what it
[1:46:10] declares that it will do
[1:46:13] we got to give voice church
[1:46:15] we're his hands
[1:46:17] we're his eyes
[1:46:18] we're his gospel
[1:46:21] and the gospel is going to be preached
[1:46:23] just play whatever you'd like to play
[1:46:27] i was at brother matt morris several
[1:46:29] weeks ago and
[1:46:30] there's a young boy they brought up for
[1:46:32] prayer
[1:46:33] this little boy was diagnosed with lupus
[1:46:36] he's probably eight or nine years old
[1:46:38] doctors just diagnosed him with lupus
[1:46:40] and they brought the young man up for
[1:46:42] prayer and said brother joe we got to go
[1:46:43] to memphis here in a few weeks and
[1:46:45] see how what the course of the
[1:46:47] treatment's going to be how do we go
[1:46:49] from here how does our life change and
[1:46:51] altering what we got to do because i
[1:46:53] guess there's really no cure for lupus
[1:46:55] you know it's just a disease that stays
[1:46:56] with them
[1:46:57] so they brought this little boy up
[1:47:00] and i'd preach the first part of this
[1:47:02] message that jesus christ is the same
[1:47:03] today
[1:47:05] sir as we are seeing
[1:47:06] jesus i took that little boy in my arms
[1:47:09] and i prayed and i said
[1:47:11] god
[1:47:12] when he goes for this doctor's visit
[1:47:15] it is my prayer through the anointing of
[1:47:18] your spirit that the doctors don't find
[1:47:21] one single trace of lupus
[1:47:24] who says that's a bold statement he's
[1:47:25] done being diagnosed
[1:47:27] i serve a big god
[1:47:30] two weeks ago this child's father called
[1:47:32] me
[1:47:34] and he called me a couple times i didn't
[1:47:35] know the number and i'm like man who is
[1:47:37] this calling me so he sends me a text
[1:47:38] brother joe this is so and so i just
[1:47:40] wanted you to know i want to tell you
[1:47:41] the story i brought my son up for prayer
[1:47:43] so i called him back and he began to
[1:47:44] tell me i brought my son up for prayer
[1:47:46] he's the one that has lupus we just went
[1:47:48] to memphis and we just came back and i
[1:47:50] want you to know brother joe that
[1:47:51] doctors didn't find one trace of lupus
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:55] they didn't find one trace of lupus
[1:47:59] it wasn't brother joe
[1:48:01] but it's jesus christ the same today
[1:48:04] and i ask you what could i do i could
[1:48:07] have sent him back to his seat but i
[1:48:09] prayed the prayer of faith i believed in
[1:48:11] a living god and it looked impossible
[1:48:14] but the god that we serve is a god of
[1:48:16] impossibility and if that devil tries to
[1:48:19] put something on you i serve a god
[1:48:21] that's able to take it off for you
[1:48:22] tonight he's the same church he's a
[1:48:25] living god tonight and he's here to see
[1:48:27] what are you gonna do about this gospel

[1:49:12] that son of god takes that word
[1:49:15] and place it on his lips
[1:49:18] it's just the same
[1:49:20] as deity speaking
