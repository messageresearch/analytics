[9:50] thankful that you are
[9:52] our refuge lord you're a hiding place in
[9:56] the midst of chaos
[9:58] you're a stronghold for the believer
[10:00] lord in the midst of disparity and
[10:02] when we see everything that's going
[10:04] around in our world today father
[10:07] we have a peace in our hearts we have
[10:09] our comfort we have a joy lord
[10:11] you've sent us a message and it's a
[10:14] message of refuge
[10:16] lord you give us resilience in the gable
[10:18] end of our soul to keep pressing the
[10:20] battle
[10:21] lord though we may not be able to see
[10:23] what lies ahead but we know
[10:25] father that you're in control of the
[10:27] very
[10:28] end of this whole civilization and lord
[10:30] as we think back and we look at
[10:32] israel lord many years ago how
[10:35] lord you rose up a hitler in a mussolini
[10:38] in a different one and
[10:39] your prophet would say it was a tender
[10:41] hand of jehovah
[10:43] calling his people go back into a
[10:45] homeland
[10:46] and father we see this rising up in this
[10:49] rising up
[10:49] it could be nothing less but the tender
[10:51] hand of jehovah preparing a body lord of
[10:54] bride
[10:54] to go into that homeland or body change
[10:56] or rapture lord there will be no more
[10:58] suffering no more anxieties no more
[11:00] pressures of life
[11:01] but lord it will be eternal bliss as
[11:04] your prophet would say it would be
[11:05] sublime
[11:06] lord we just ask tonight lord as we have
[11:10] our arms and our hands
[11:12] praying for our neighbor you know what
[11:13] they're going through father
[11:15] each of us face our own our own
[11:18] challenges our own struggles our own
[11:19] trials
[11:21] but god each of us are trusting in you
[11:23] tonight and we believe
[11:25] father that you gave a word he said we
[11:28] believe therefore we speak
[11:30] we're speaking these things tonight
[11:32] whatever the need may be
[11:33] if it's healing we believe you're the
[11:35] healer tonight
[11:36] for you said by my stripes we are
[11:39] already healed lord that's past
[11:41] tense so we believe that for brother ron
[11:43] tonight
[11:44] we look forward to a positive report
[11:47] lord we believe that for brother
[11:48] jonathan tonight you'll restore us back
[11:50] father
[11:50] he'll walk out of this service tonight
[11:52] without any symptoms or any
[11:54] ailments or any aches or pains tonight
[11:56] and for everyone that's here lord they
[11:57] may have brought a need in
[11:59] but father i believe tonight we can
[12:01] leave our needs at the altar
[12:02] and walk out completely free lord
[12:07] so we just commit this service to you

[12:11] a series here of late
[12:13] lord a wonderful series on casting down
[12:15] imagination surely lord

[12:20] gave us the greatest weapon
[12:22] and we're exercising that weapon of
[12:24] prayer tonight and we're asking for the
[12:25] mighty hand of god to come down
[12:27] and that you would speak to us lord
[12:28] minister to our hearts

[28:29] says for though we
[28:30] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[28:32] the flesh
[28:33] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[28:36] carnal
[28:37] but mighty through god to the pulling
[28:40] down of strongholds
[28:42] casting down imaginations and every high
[28:45] thing that exalted itself against the
[28:47] knowledge of god
[28:49] and bringing into captivity every
[28:51] thought to the obedience of christ
[28:54] also psalms 23 and verse 1.
[29:02] says hear the lord i'm sure we could no
[29:05] doubt quote this by heart the lord is my
[29:07] shepherd
[29:08] i shall not want he maketh me to lie
[29:11] down in green pastures
[29:13] he leadeth me beside the still waters he
[29:16] restoreth my
[29:17] soul he leadeth me in the past of
[29:20] righteousness for his name's sake
[29:23] yea though i'll walk through the valley
[29:25] of the shadow of death
[29:26] i will fear no evil for thou art with me
[29:30] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[29:33] thou preparest the table before me
[29:36] in the presence of my enemy thou
[29:39] anointest
[29:40] my head with oil my cup runneth over
[29:43] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[29:46] me
[29:47] all the days of my life and i will dwell
[29:51] in the house of the lord forever
[29:54] amen we let you be seated today
[30:04] a man
[30:04] [Music]
[30:07] named henry ward beecher was cited by
[30:11] charles spurgeon speaking about the
[30:13] psalms 23
[30:15] said it psalms 23 has charmed more
[30:18] griefs to rest
[30:20] than all the philosophy of the world it
[30:23] has remained
[30:24] remanded reprimanded to the redundance
[30:27] more thoughts more black doubts
[30:30] more thieving sorrows than there are
[30:33] sands
[30:34] on the seashore it has comforted the
[30:37] noble
[30:38] host of the poor it has sung courage to
[30:41] the army of the disappointed
[30:44] it has poured bomb and consolation into
[30:46] the heart of the sick
[30:48] the captives and dungeons the widows and
[30:51] their griefs the orphans and their
[30:53] loneliness
[30:54] dying soldiers have died easier as it
[30:57] was read to them ghastly hospitals have
[30:59] been illuminated
[31:01] it has visited the prisoner it has
[31:03] broken his chains
[31:05] and like peter's angels led him forth
[31:08] and sung him back to his home again it
[31:11] has made the dying
[31:13] christian slave freer than his master
[31:16] and has consoled those whom dying he
[31:19] left behind mourning
[31:20] not so much that he was gone but because
[31:24] they were left behind and could not go
[31:27] to
[31:27] what a wonderful scripture what a
[31:30] comfort you can pull in times
[31:32] from this scripture and as we've been
[31:35] speaking on casting down imaginations
[31:38] you know one thing david laid right at
[31:40] the beginning
[31:41] is the lord is my shepherd
[31:45] is not might be or may be or could be
[31:48] the lord
[31:49] is my shepherd and since the lord is my
[31:52] shepherd he will provide for me he will
[31:55] take care of me
[31:56] he will protect me he will save me he
[31:59] will
[32:00] heal me he will deliver me and and
[32:03] looking at casting down imaginations and
[32:05] we've been speaking about the greatest
[32:07] bout through the
[32:08] taking many thoughts from the greatest
[32:11] battle ever thought or ever fought
[32:13] but looking at this one part of this
[32:15] scripture
[32:16] the fifth verse it says thou has
[32:18] anointed
[32:19] my head with all now we know david as he
[32:23] was a
[32:24] a king as he would write this but one
[32:26] day before he was a shepherd
[32:28] and the scripture speaks of him a little
[32:30] shepherd boy
[32:31] tending his father's sheep and so he
[32:33] knew what it would take to take care of
[32:36] sheep and what they had to have and what
[32:38] they needed and
[32:39] and he would take this and bring it to
[32:41] his life as a
[32:42] as a king under the under the rulership
[32:45] of god
[32:46] and and looking at this you anoint my
[32:48] head with oil i begin to look at that
[32:50] and begin to think on it
[32:52] as what that would mean and and
[32:54] considered in the natural
[32:56] as far as to a sheep and i found this
[32:58] that would speak about in grazing time
[33:01] that was a prime season for all kind of
[33:03] bugs and insects
[33:05] and this presented a serious problem for
[33:08] the shepherd
[33:09] and his sheep there's a list of pests
[33:12] that's almost endless and we know no in
[33:15] louisiana as
[33:16] far as the bugs and my goodness it's
[33:17] almost endless
[33:19] there's a war warble flies and bot flies
[33:22] and hill flies every kind of fly
[33:24] that would aggravate the sheep as they
[33:26] would try to graze
[33:27] but the most the worst kind was a type
[33:30] of fly it's called the nose fly
[33:32] that would actually lay an egg in the
[33:34] mucous membrane
[33:36] lining of the sheep's nose and when it
[33:39] hatched
[33:39] that larva would begin to bar burrow
[33:42] into the sheep's flesh
[33:44] getting into the under their skin until
[33:46] it would cause
[33:47] intense inflammation and irritation and
[33:50] these
[33:51] parasites became so annoying that the
[33:53] sheep
[33:54] would beat their heads against the rocks
[33:56] and trees to try and find relief
[33:59] and so to counteract that this at the
[34:01] first sign of flies the
[34:03] shepherd would apply this homemade
[34:05] remedy they had in that day of maybe
[34:07] some
[34:08] linseed oil or sulfur and tar
[34:11] and they and it was an ancient
[34:12] equivalent to insect repellent
[34:15] and they would they would place it upon
[34:17] the sheep's head
[34:18] and and and then you know as a sheep a
[34:21] behavior of a sheep that
[34:23] that that would require the application
[34:25] of the oil and you know that the
[34:27] goat's sheep they have this tendency you
[34:29] know to be affectionate to one another
[34:31] and even to their shepherd
[34:32] and a sheep will often rub their heads
[34:35] with one another in a way of saying how
[34:37] you doing you know
[34:38] that kind of thing with sheep sheep talk
[34:40] but if one sheep
[34:41] was infected it could impass that
[34:44] infection onto the other sheep
[34:46] and so knowing this danger the sheep
[34:48] shepherd would restrain his sheep from a
[34:50] new field and
[34:51] and they would begin to mix up this oil
[34:54] that they would begin to get ready
[34:56] and but before he would even move him to
[34:58] a field he would walk
[34:59] up and down looking for a little small
[35:01] holes that may be in the field
[35:03] and he would take this bottle this thick
[35:05] of this bottle of thick oil from his
[35:07] belt
[35:08] and he'd rake back the long grass of the
[35:10] staff and he'd pour
[35:11] a circle of wall around each of these
[35:14] little holes now these little holes were
[35:16] snake holes and he would put this all
[35:18] around each hole that he would find and
[35:20] before he would lead his sheep into the
[35:22] new green field
[35:24] he would also spread this oil over each
[35:26] sheep's head
[35:27] in the sense he was anointing them or
[35:30] rubbing their heads with his oil
[35:32] and when the snakes beneath the surface
[35:35] would begin to see it sense the presence
[35:37] of the sheep
[35:38] and attempt to maybe come out and attack
[35:41] they were unable to do so because of the
[35:44] oil that was placed over their hole
[35:46] they went unable to come out and became
[35:49] essentially
[35:50] prisoners inside their own hole amen the
[35:53] oil on the sheep's head
[35:55] acts as a repellent so the snake if a
[35:58] snake does manage to come near it would
[36:00] the repellent would help even drive them
[36:02] away so
[36:04] in the very literal sense of all of this
[36:07] by oiling the snakes burrow by putting
[36:10] on their heads
[36:11] amen the shepherd had prepared the table
[36:14] or the meadow
[36:15] for the sheep to graze right in the
[36:18] abundance
[36:19] of all kind of enemies laying right
[36:21] beneath them
[36:23] amen so we know and we know in the
[36:25] scripture that all
[36:26] is symbolic of the holy spirit amen and
[36:29] so we also have this same anointing
[36:32] that's been afforded to us in this day
[36:34] amen and here we are in the worst
[36:37] ages ever been with the worst snakes has
[36:40] ever been the worst poisonous snakes
[36:42] there's ever been
[36:43] satan coming with his last blows with
[36:45] his last breath
[36:46] and god has prepared us a table to eat
[36:49] at
[36:50] even in the presence of our own enemies
[36:52] and satan's own
[36:54] eden is going to become a trap for him
[36:57] amen for his destruction that that it as
[37:00] for his
[37:02] my demise amen so stab it standing
[37:05] between
[37:05] us and that old worm the devil amen it
[37:09] tries to bore his way
[37:10] through many avenues of reasonings and
[37:13] doubts and confusions
[37:14] but that anointing is standing there
[37:17] between
[37:18] us and the enemy and it is the anointing
[37:21] that breaks the
[37:22] yoke off the of off of our lives amen
[37:25] this is what isaiah was saying
[37:27] isaiah 10 and verse 27 he said it came
[37:29] to pass in that day that his burden
[37:31] shall be taken away
[37:33] from off of his shoulder and the yoke
[37:35] off of thy
[37:36] neck and the yoke shall be destroyed
[37:38] because
[37:39] of the anointing amen because of the
[37:42] anointing i'm thankful god didn't leave
[37:44] us
[37:44] without any anointing in this age that
[37:47] the holy spirit is still here working
[37:49] amen the same oil of god is still in the
[37:52] lamp stands
[37:53] it's still burning amen with the same
[37:55] fire lit by the fire of god
[37:57] burning in every heart that will receive
[38:00] it amen burning in every life that will
[38:02] receive it amen
[38:03] amen burning is a fire burning in our
[38:06] hearts now
[38:07] i want you to know something in the
[38:08] difference between an animal and you
[38:10] amen we'll get into this even a little
[38:12] later amen
[38:13] the sheep didn't have no choice the
[38:16] sheep they would have to take whatever
[38:17] the shepherd would give it
[38:19] if the shepherd would want to come and
[38:20] put the oil on his head the sheep may
[38:22] run for a little bit but sooner or later
[38:24] would get caught and the shepherd would
[38:26] have to that sheep couldn't say yes or
[38:27] no
[38:28] but we as humans have the ability amen
[38:31] to say yes or no
[38:33] amen amen you know brother tim has
[38:35] brought this out before with goats you
[38:37] know if he seen a goat that was sick or
[38:39] or was or sitting off to itself and
[38:42] wasn't doing right
[38:43] he would look and check certain signs
[38:45] and see what it needs and by what he saw
[38:48] he'd go into the cabinet he'd get the
[38:49] medicine he'd come i helped him many
[38:51] times we'd grab the goat didn't ask a
[38:53] question
[38:54] then ask it if it felt like taking the
[38:56] medicine if he wanted to take the
[38:57] medicine
[38:58] if it don't want if it wanted to wait
[38:59] tomorrow then ask it one question
[39:01] we grabbed it by the head opened his
[39:02] mouth and put it down his throat
[39:04] but that's not how we as humans are amen
[39:07] amen it takes the la
[39:08] the the holy ghost can come into a
[39:10] building but it's up to us to receive it
[39:13] it's up to us to say yes lord i want
[39:15] that in my life
[39:16] i want you to have preeminence on my
[39:18] mind on my heart on my thoughts amen
[39:21] god can anoint he can bring the
[39:23] anointing into the building but it takes
[39:25] every heart saying yes lord
[39:27] i want part of that i want you to pour
[39:29] it out upon my life amen
[39:31] and so we see the holy spirit though
[39:33] comes amen to stand
[39:35] between us and our thoughts
[39:39] amen to stand between us and the thing
[39:42] that old worm that tries to board in now
[39:44] we see the world i mean the world is
[39:46] being bored amen with every kind of
[39:48] demonic thing
[39:49] amen their minds are being taken over
[39:51] they're they're being taken over by a
[39:53] strong delusion their
[39:54] their minds are insanity
[39:58] and complete insanity you see the world
[40:00] being taken off
[40:01] even our even our own our own country
[40:04] been taken over
[40:05] by complete insanity amen and it's only
[40:09] going to get worse
[40:10] and worse as it goes along amen but god
[40:12] has allowed us to have
[40:14] something in this life amen the holy
[40:16] ghost that can keep you sane
[40:18] in an insane world it can keep you with
[40:20] a reality that goes beyond the things of
[40:23] this life and this world that we're
[40:24] living in is so far beyond that
[40:27] but to keep you amen to have a have a
[40:29] stabilized life
[40:31] i mean to be able to be stable in the
[40:33] time that we're living in is a miracle
[40:35] amen to be able to have a mind amen that
[40:38] can think straight they can
[40:39] that can i can move straight is a
[40:41] miracle in the time that we're living in
[40:44] amen because the world is going
[40:46] completely insane
[40:47] amen even james would talk about the oil
[40:50] he said
[40:51] if any sick among you let him call for
[40:53] the elders of the church
[40:55] let them pray over you anointing him
[40:58] with all
[40:59] in the name of the lord what is this it
[41:01] is this is a symbol of the holy ghost
[41:03] that stands between you and the sickness
[41:06] we're placing it between you and the
[41:08] sickness
[41:10] hallelujah and the prayer of faith shall
[41:12] save the sick
[41:13] and the lord shall raise him up and if
[41:15] he has committed sins they shall
[41:18] be forgiven you so the holy spirit
[41:20] stands between you and the sickness
[41:23] the holy spirit stands between you and
[41:25] the depression
[41:26] the holy spirit will stand between you
[41:29] and the blind battles that you're going
[41:31] through
[41:31] and the things that are going on listen
[41:33] the holy spirit
[41:34] will stand between you and your young
[41:36] people and the loyalty seeing spirit
[41:38] that's trying to take you over amen it
[41:41] will stand between you
[41:46] it's the same as the pitch that would go
[41:49] in the gopher wood
[41:51] and it would stand between noah and the
[41:53] flood
[41:55] amen this is what we're talking about
[41:57] amen these imaginations and things that
[41:59] and the devil trying to pump in our
[42:01] minds tight day after day
[42:03] moment after moment and we see it taking
[42:06] over a world
[42:08] amen listen you see the gay agenda and
[42:11] where it is today
[42:12] and where it was even 20 years ago or 50
[42:14] years ago when it was just coming out of
[42:16] the closet
[42:17] and now it's more of an accepted thing
[42:20] what is it
[42:20] it's a bore a worm borne into minds
[42:24] to where it's become an accepted thing
[42:28] that's what happened with women dressing
[42:30] like men it became such an accepted
[42:32] thing today you can go down there
[42:34] and you don't think nothing about it a
[42:36] woman can look like a man and you don't
[42:38] already think nothing about it
[42:39] and now vice versa we see now men are
[42:42] starting to go like women and we're like
[42:44] yeah it won't be long that board is
[42:47] going to get in there to where
[42:48] it won't be nothing different
[42:50] [Music]
[42:52] amen amen but there is a pitch that will
[42:55] stand between you
[42:56] and the judgment oh hallelujah
[43:00] there is an atonement that will stand
[43:01] between you and the judgment just like
[43:04] it did noah
[43:05] amen the pitch that was in the gopher
[43:07] wood in the ark was to keep out
[43:09] or to atone the believer from the wrath
[43:14] there's a people that's atoned from the
[43:16] wrath oh hallelujah
[43:18] hallelujah amen noah could not get to
[43:21] the wrath
[43:22] and the wrath could not get to noah
[43:25] he could not come into the judgment
[43:27] because there was an atonement between
[43:29] him and the judgment
[43:31] and the judgment was the water amen as
[43:33] it stood out so they are
[43:34] and therefore also the believer in
[43:36] christ is also
[43:38] safely secured amen not upon our merits
[43:41] but on the obedience that i'm walking
[43:43] into the ark
[43:45] i'm getting under the holy ghost i'm
[43:47] getting under the token of god
[43:49] whatever it takes i'm going to die out
[43:51] to my old nature
[43:52] i'm going to take the nature of a sheep
[43:54] and say yes shepherd
[43:55] i'll take what you got hallelujah
[44:00] listen the world's taking what the
[44:02] devil's got
[44:05] why can't we take what god's got
[44:10] the only thing noah had to do was get
[44:12] into the ark
[44:14] he didn't even have to shut the door god
[44:16] did that
[44:18] walk in that's all the believer does
[44:20] walk by
[44:21] faith in christ god takes care of the
[44:24] rest
[44:25] hallelujah god takes care of the rest he
[44:28] that heareth my words and believeth on
[44:29] him that send me
[44:30] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[44:34] into the judgment but pass from death
[44:37] and the life
[44:38] oh and save forevermore let judgment
[44:41] rocker if it wants to he said why
[44:43] i imagine sometimes the ark was standing
[44:45] on his end
[44:47] felt like it was upside down everything
[44:49] else was going on that kind of how 2020s
[44:52] felt
[44:53] amen up on his ends feel like it's
[44:55] upside down and everything else
[44:57] but noah was safe why because there was
[45:01] something
[45:01] that was planned already for the water
[45:04] it was something greater than the water
[45:08] it proved to be greater than the water
[45:10] because 40 days later he got out on dry
[45:12] ground
[45:14] oh hallelujah amen so will this holy
[45:16] ghost proved
[45:17] to be greater than anything the devil
[45:19] can bring up
[45:20] greater than any sickness he can bring
[45:23] up greater than any problems he can
[45:24] bring up this holy ghost will prove
[45:27] to be greater it's proved it and so
[45:32] therefore
[45:33] the pitch stood between him and the
[45:35] judgment
[45:37] oh my don't you glad you got somebody
[45:39] standing between you and the judgment
[45:42] whoa jesus the blood of jesus christ
[45:44] god's son stands
[45:46] between us and all the judgment
[45:50] you know every man coming to this world
[45:53] is born in sin
[45:54] shaped in iniquity coming to this world
[45:56] speaking lies
[45:58] undone unlovely ungodly away from god
[46:01] and alienated without hope without
[46:02] christ dying
[46:04] going to a sinner's grave ready for
[46:06] judgment
[46:07] now i i know i've spoke to some brother
[46:10] but the ill being won you know you come
[46:12] out of the world and you come to a
[46:14] church like this and you think man
[46:15] these people always been holy no we
[46:18] ain't always been holy
[46:21] no every one of us had faults had
[46:23] failures just heard about everyone's
[46:25] born in sin
[46:27] shaped in iniquity came into this world
[46:29] speaking lies unlovely ungodly
[46:32] alienated without hope going to a
[46:34] sinner's grave
[46:35] but then the word comes along
[46:38] whoo hallelujah sharper than any
[46:41] two-edged sword
[46:43] and it cuts down a tree and it hews it
[46:45] out and it cuts off them stickers and
[46:48] all those thorns and cuts the best part
[46:50] out of it
[46:52] it's pliable that and it's now put into
[46:55] the hands of christ
[46:56] and he takes another tree and he puts it
[46:59] under a fire and he begins to boil the
[47:01] sap out of it
[47:02] and he takes the life out of that tree
[47:04] and puts it in this tree
[47:07] hallelujah that's exactly what the ark
[47:09] represented the wood represented
[47:11] humanity
[47:12] that was full of holes been bored
[47:14] through after
[47:16] with this mind battle and bored through
[47:18] with this problem and poured through
[47:19] with this thing
[47:20] and this sin come and blowed a hole in
[47:22] it but there was a tree
[47:25] that was greater than the hole that was
[47:27] greater than the damage
[47:30] and i'm here to tell you this god has
[47:32] not found one that's unrepairable
[47:36] that he can't do something with if it
[47:38] had his name before the foundation of
[47:40] the world
[47:41] no matter how many holes the devil has
[47:43] poured into their mind
[47:45] born into their body this god is greater
[47:52] hallelujah and that life from that tree
[47:55] is poured into another tree to protect
[47:59] it
[48:00] to protect it to make an atonement to
[48:03] make it
[48:03] amen through the judgment through the
[48:05] things he said a man just says well i
[48:07] believe the word i'll just take this
[48:09] without the blood you're left to the
[48:12] world
[48:15] hello somebody you that don't believe in
[48:18] blood he said
[48:19] without the blood you're left to the
[48:22] world
[48:24] no matter how much you're in the ark how
[48:27] much
[48:27] ark or what bored you are you've got to
[48:30] get pitched
[48:32] you got to soak it up
[48:35] glory to god you got to soak up the holy
[48:39] ghost
[48:40] and keep the world out
[48:43] hallelujah you know what
[48:46] we could see a tree that was cut down
[48:49] and it was beat until all the liquid
[48:51] come out of it
[48:52] water blood and spirit so that we could
[48:55] be sealed
[48:58] to win to the first mind battle
[49:02] to the first sorrow for to the first
[49:04] lost to the first
[49:05] no to the day of our redemption which is
[49:08] our full redemption the change of our
[49:10] body
[49:12] amen this holy ghost is not not
[49:14] something that's not this is just about
[49:16] to lose steam here no it's a seal
[49:19] and he put his own name behind that seal
[49:22] and he said devils come on and do what
[49:24] you got to do you're not going to break
[49:25] this seal
[49:27] amen so that he could stand so we could
[49:30] stand the test you know
[49:31] the next and the next ark that we spoke
[49:33] of was moses
[49:34] put into a little basket on on the nile
[49:37] river
[49:38] amen provided by his mother the one who
[49:40] gave him birth
[49:41] not some seminary not some theological
[49:43] experience experience
[49:44] but the one who gives the believer birth
[49:48] prepares the ark for him to carry him
[49:51] through
[49:51] so she weaved it with a little stalks
[49:53] you know little corn stalks or whatever
[49:55] they had there
[49:56] and she built this art but then she took
[49:57] some pitch and she put it all the way
[50:00] around it slimed it
[50:01] inside and out ain't meant to make an
[50:03] atonement and that little baby moses was
[50:06] laying in that basket
[50:07] and he pushed it out into the judgment
[50:09] of the waters amen thickness
[50:11] into the waters it says it always mean
[50:13] thickness and multitudes of people
[50:15] and the little fellow out there little
[50:17] cover over his face out of the nile
[50:19] river
[50:20] you know running real swift alligators
[50:22] on every side
[50:24] rains and storms coming but little moses
[50:26] looking up at the stars in the sky
[50:29] at night and the wind blowing the
[50:30] crocodile's bumping his basket
[50:32] but he was still just as safe and just
[50:35] as protected
[50:36] because between him and the judgment was
[50:38] an atonement
[50:40] between him and all the gales and the
[50:42] heavenly winds
[50:43] the devil could sin was an atonement
[50:48] hallelujah amen between you and year
[50:51] 2020
[50:52] is an atonement between you and whatever
[50:56] years we got
[50:57] is an atonement
[51:02] and he floated right through it
[51:05] he said we could look just a moment with
[51:07] some different eyes we'd see the holy
[51:09] spirit
[51:09] hovering over that little basket we
[51:12] could see angels of god
[51:13] sitting near down down each shore with
[51:16] their swords drawn
[51:18] no there was nothing going to touch that
[51:19] basket
[51:21] no i can see the devil trying to sink it
[51:25] with nothing going to get to it
[51:29] we can look back and know again noah
[51:32] could just be in there singing
[51:33] jesus keep me near the cross
[51:37] and all outside all the devils in hell
[51:40] couldn't take it because it was built
[51:43] according
[51:44] to god's instructions
[51:47] there was an atonement standing between
[51:49] him in judgment and mercy
[51:51] and though therefore every believer
[51:52] today no matter how hard it may seem
[51:55] how hard life may seem did you hear that
[52:00] no matter how hard life may seem as long
[52:03] as you're in christ jesus
[52:06] how many is in christ jesus there's
[52:08] nothing present
[52:10] nothing future oh hallelujah amen can
[52:13] reach your soul and separate you from
[52:15] the love of god in christ jesus
[52:17] the devil can turn every gate and hell
[52:20] loose on you

[1:00:34] moving up to stand between us and the
[1:00:36] sickness stand between us and death
[1:00:38] no wonder david could say very surely
[1:00:40] yea
[1:00:41] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:00:43] shadow of death
[1:00:46] i'll fear no evil you know in our life
[1:00:50] there's always a shadow of death hanging
[1:00:52] over us
[1:00:53] our bodies are going down into death
[1:00:57] things happen in our life every day and
[1:00:59] situations arise
[1:01:01] and it's always got that shadow that in
[1:01:03] the background of death
[1:01:05] but david said even in that i'll fear no
[1:01:07] evil
[1:01:08] why because thou art with me don't
[1:01:11] forget who's with you
[1:01:12] standing there the angel of god went
[1:01:14] stood between them and the enemy
[1:01:16] and the angel of god is standing tonight
[1:01:19] between
[1:01:19] every individual and the enemy
[1:01:23] how many individuals we got here tonight
[1:01:26] every
[1:01:26] individual and the enemy i know what i'm
[1:01:30] speaking about i know while standing
[1:01:32] here
[1:01:32] amen on the platform before you tonight
[1:01:34] i know that god
[1:01:36] has condescended coming down from glory
[1:01:38] it's in the building right now
[1:01:40] if you only dare to move out on god's
[1:01:43] word
[1:01:44] and see if he don't move before you now
[1:01:46] it came between the camp of the
[1:01:48] egyptians
[1:01:50] and the israelites and he's becoming
[1:01:52] between you
[1:01:53] and your problem oh hallelujah
[1:01:58] if that's the case your problem don't
[1:01:59] have a chance
[1:02:02] your sickness don't have a chance
[1:02:05] glory to god pharaoh didn't have a
[1:02:08] chance
[1:02:10] even when the odds looked like it was in
[1:02:12] his favor he had all the horses he had
[1:02:14] all the chariots
[1:02:15] he had all the armor he had all the
[1:02:18] weapons he had it
[1:02:19] all but he didn't have god
[1:02:28] he was a light to one and darkness to
[1:02:32] another
[1:02:34] the israelites
[1:02:37] after moses prayed they could lay down
[1:02:40] in peace
[1:02:42] notice all night the egyptians could not
[1:02:45] enter the camp of israel
[1:02:47] the darkest of nights the enemy still
[1:02:50] could not come in
[1:02:54] we see that moses stretched out his hand
[1:02:56] over the sea
[1:02:57] and the lord caused the sea to go back a
[1:03:00] strong end east wind blew all night the
[1:03:02] scripture says and
[1:03:03] and the children of israel went across
[1:03:05] the ground
[1:03:06] on dry ground but if you'll notice while
[1:03:10] the children of israel had come out of
[1:03:12] darkness and accepted light
[1:03:13] when they got in trouble the light
[1:03:17] turned around for their defense
[1:03:21] and they slept in peace what god was
[1:03:24] making away
[1:03:28] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:03:32] amen he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:03:34] pastures
[1:03:35] he restoreth my soul yea though i walk
[1:03:38] to the valley the shadow of death
[1:03:40] i fear no evil why my shepherd's with me
[1:03:44] hallelujah god promised to make a way of
[1:03:48] escape
[1:03:51] and he was working on it while they
[1:03:53] rested
[1:03:55] he was making a way while he was resting
[1:03:57] in the promise
[1:03:59] while they was holding on to i am the
[1:04:01] lord god that heals all my desire thy
[1:04:03] diseases
[1:04:04] he was making a way he was moving aside
[1:04:07] demons and fighting devils and
[1:04:09] pushing them back and said no that's my
[1:04:11] son that's my daughter
[1:04:12] you can't go there
[1:04:21] he's i'm so glad that i've been filled
[1:04:22] with the holy spirit
[1:04:25] and while we're rejoicing while we're
[1:04:28] resting
[1:04:29] in the promises of god god is making a
[1:04:32] way of escape
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:38] so thereby you can cast down the
[1:04:39] imaginations
[1:04:41] you can try to figure out how it's all
[1:04:43] going to come to pass and who's going to
[1:04:45] be what
[1:04:45] is nothing but imaginations god's got a
[1:04:48] plan
[1:04:49] and god's going to bring it to
[1:04:50] fulfillment and but god's working on our
[1:04:53] escape
[1:04:56] and he's providing he's making it just
[1:04:59] perfect
[1:05:01] then in the darkness of the night a
[1:05:03] thief can come in and people don't even
[1:05:08] know why because they can't see
[1:05:16] and she's gone
[1:05:22] he said every man woman that'll accept
[1:05:25] jesus christ the holy spirit while
[1:05:27] you're asleep
[1:05:28] while you're rested maybe you're
[1:05:29] crippled maybe you're blind maybe you
[1:05:31] can't hear maybe you can't see maybe
[1:05:32] you're sick
[1:05:34] heart trouble cancer something dying
[1:05:37] except the light
[1:05:38] and rest and the same wind
[1:05:42] that opened the red sea was the same
[1:05:44] wind that came down on the day of
[1:05:46] pentecost
[1:05:48] amen and we'll move down through and
[1:05:50] open and it came down on the day of
[1:05:51] pentecost
[1:05:52] it'll also move down through your way
[1:05:54] and open a way for you
[1:05:56] and you'll pass right through the valley
[1:05:58] of sickness
[1:05:59] right back to the land of health again
[1:06:02] you'll pass right to the land of cold
[1:06:04] formal shackled down in different
[1:06:05] religions
[1:06:06] back to the holy ghost field happy
[1:06:08] rejoicing heart full of joy and life
[1:06:10] again
[1:06:11] god the great holy spirit standing here
[1:06:13] tonight
[1:06:14] between death and life
[1:06:20] standing between sickness and health
[1:06:23] right now the same holy spirit
[1:06:25] that you feel now every born-again
[1:06:27] person bound to feel the spirit of god
[1:06:29] you can't help it if you got life in you
[1:06:32] you know what it is
[1:06:37] but jeremiah would ask the question
[1:06:42] is there no bomb in gilead
[1:06:47] is there no physician there why
[1:06:50] then not as the health of the daughter
[1:06:52] of my people
[1:06:53] recovered there was bomb there
[1:06:59] there was the great physician there but
[1:07:02] they was not recovered because they
[1:07:04] would not accept him
[1:07:07] he would move and he would come he would
[1:07:09] he would anoint a service he would do
[1:07:11] things
[1:07:11] and they would just sit there like
[1:07:12] nothing's going on
[1:07:15] nothing is happening
[1:07:20] we all not be like the world and act
[1:07:22] like nothing is going on
[1:07:25] they act like that you know the world is
[1:07:26] acting like well it's just another
[1:07:28] election another time of you know
[1:07:30] whoever's stealing this do it blah blah
[1:07:32] blah
[1:07:32] just just just just another day
[1:07:36] meanwhile we're sitting over here
[1:07:37] looking and saying no
[1:07:39] things are putting and being put in
[1:07:41] place
[1:07:43] things are taking place god is moving
[1:07:45] god is orchestrating
[1:07:47] it's for our going away party
[1:07:51] so therefore in the world let's bring it
[1:07:53] down to our church
[1:07:54] let's don't ever sit in a church service
[1:07:56] like nothing is going on
[1:07:59] like nothing is happening and we're
[1:08:00] wondering why why
[1:08:02] why is my children still suffering why
[1:08:04] am i why my son still not saying why
[1:08:07] why is this going why am i still having
[1:08:08] this trouble because
[1:08:10] the great physician's here the bomb is
[1:08:13] here
[1:08:16] but do you know the problem is we've got
[1:08:18] too many with goat natures that's right
[1:08:21] stubborn humanity
[1:08:25] always worried about you know something
[1:08:27] different their minds are off somewhere
[1:08:29] else
[1:08:31] you mean while god's walking down the
[1:08:33] aisles and not one row is left out
[1:08:40] hello somebody not one row is left out
[1:08:48] well i didn't get nothing out of that
[1:08:50] service but did you see him walk by
[1:08:53] and when you seen him walk by did you
[1:08:55] reach out and say lord i need you
[1:08:59] and cast down the imaginations and and
[1:09:01] the things that are around you
[1:09:03] amen we must take the remedy
[1:09:10] churches are crying out why why do we
[1:09:12] don't have no young people why
[1:09:14] why is it just older folks why because
[1:09:16] they refuse the remedy
[1:09:20] brother brandon would preach that and
[1:09:21] why go listen to it wonderful service
[1:09:23] he said why are people dying in the pews
[1:09:29] let's not fool ourselves it happens at
[1:09:30] evening like tabernacle too
[1:09:33] people die right in the pews
[1:09:38] why when the remedy is there and but why
[1:09:41] is it they refuse it
[1:09:43] it's like i was saying earlier we can't
[1:09:45] the pa the pastor you know people get
[1:09:46] upset at the pastor because he don't
[1:09:48] he don't preach this enough and he don't
[1:09:50] preach that enough and he don't line up
[1:09:51] to their legalism but anyway
[1:09:52] you know he got he got a preacher dress
[1:09:55] code and he got a really hammer on this
[1:09:57] and he really got a hammer on that
[1:09:58] and meanwhile i've been to a pastor's
[1:10:01] church and i know preachers of
[1:10:03] clothesline religion
[1:10:05] but yet their sisters are dressed not
[1:10:07] not according to that
[1:10:10] just to put it lightly but you know the
[1:10:12] man preaches it
[1:10:13] i've heard him preach it but why are
[1:10:16] they like that because they won't accept
[1:10:17] the remedy
[1:10:20] too much for them to swallow their pride
[1:10:23] stands in the way
[1:10:24] their arrogance stands in the way i have
[1:10:26] you to know i can do what i want yeah
[1:10:28] you can do what you want to do
[1:10:31] all day long
[1:10:35] congratulations you live in the u.s
[1:10:37] you're free to do whatever you want to
[1:10:39] do
[1:10:40] as a human but as a son of god
[1:10:45] you lay them all down as a sheep
[1:10:49] i said lord you're my shepherd
[1:10:52] there's a whole world being led
[1:10:53] somewhere
[1:10:55] amen but i want this shepherd to leave
[1:10:57] me

[1:11:01] whatever i got to do if i got to lay
[1:11:02] aside every right every pride everything
[1:11:05] he said that's the reason why there's no
[1:11:07] cure for sin
[1:11:08] in people's life because they won't take
[1:11:10] the remedy
[1:11:11] they refuse the toxin they refuse amen
[1:11:14] to take what god
[1:11:16] has ordained to give the holy ghost amen
[1:11:19] to be completely separated amen from
[1:11:21] their sins

[1:11:24] physician what's the matter with the
[1:11:26] daughter of my people

[1:23:22] it's a mess and you know before you can
[1:23:26] be born you have to die
[1:23:29] and some people have a hard time dying
[1:23:32] this is a prophet of god they kick they
[1:23:34] ball they scream they carry on but
[1:23:36] unless a corn of wheat falls in the
[1:23:38] ground
[1:23:38] amen abides alone if you want to bring
[1:23:40] forth fruit you got to die to yourself
[1:23:43] you got to die to your man-made
[1:23:44] theologies you got to die to your
[1:23:46] reasonings
[1:23:47] you got to die to your imaginations you
[1:23:49] got to die to it all
[1:23:51] and be born again of the spirit of god

[1:24:16] know we got this big deal now with this
[1:24:17] vaccine coming out
[1:24:19] you know how they figure it out to try
[1:24:21] to figure out if it's going to work
[1:24:23] they take maybe we call it a guinea pig
[1:24:25] but a guinea pig might be a rat
[1:24:26] mouse any kind of thing they poke it
[1:24:28] into to see if it might work
[1:24:31] and if he survives it then they'll try
[1:24:33] it on you
[1:24:35] yes
[1:24:40] but everybody ain't made like a guinea
[1:24:42] pig
[1:24:44] everybody ain't made like a rat
[1:24:47] sometimes a medicine will kill you
[1:24:50] there's been about as many killed he
[1:24:51] said with penicillin that had been
[1:24:52] healed
[1:24:54] everybody ain't made it like it'll help
[1:24:55] some but it'll kill others because all
[1:24:57] men ain't made like guinea pigs
[1:24:59] but you know it'll keep help some and
[1:25:01] it'll kill others but there's one thing
[1:25:02] for sure
[1:25:04] god's toxin will hurt no one but cure
[1:25:07] all
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:10] that's right it'll hurt no one but kill
[1:25:12] but he'll all
[1:25:13] it heals all the broken hearted it heals
[1:25:16] all those that are downcast it'll heal
[1:25:19] you
[1:25:20] it'll heal your neighbor it won't kill
[1:25:22] you
[1:25:24] but it will heal you
[1:25:28] you take a little wash woman it's so
[1:25:30] backward she can't even talk to the
[1:25:32] insurance man that comes to the door but
[1:25:34] let her get filled with the holy ghost
[1:25:36] she'll give a testimony to shake the
[1:25:37] shingles off the top of the house
[1:25:39] so you've got something now in there
[1:25:41] born of the spirit of god
[1:25:42] you take the ordinary uh ornis
[1:25:47] i don't know how you say that word
[1:25:48] prostitute that ever walked in the
[1:25:50] street out there the dog wouldn't ever
[1:25:52] look at her
[1:25:52] let her come in and get cleaned up from
[1:25:54] god she'll be credited to any
[1:25:56] neighborhood or
[1:25:57] church that's the toxin we're talking
[1:26:01] about
[1:26:01] they give it to a little guinea pig but
[1:26:03] you know what god did he took his toxin
[1:26:05] and he gave it to himself
[1:26:08] he said let me try it myself to see what
[1:26:10] it worked and he went down to the river
[1:26:12] jordan he took a
[1:26:13] dose of that toxin and immediately the
[1:26:15] spirit led him to the wilderness to be
[1:26:17] tempted of the devil and it held him
[1:26:21] through every mind battle through every
[1:26:23] temptation through every struggle
[1:26:25] through every problem
[1:26:26] and in hell oh hallelujah
[1:26:29] in the garden of gethsemane could you
[1:26:31] imagine the mind battles
[1:26:33] could you imagine the imaginations
[1:26:37] what are the romans going to do to me
[1:26:40] what am i going to have to suffer how
[1:26:42] bad is it going to be
[1:26:46] such anxiety until blood began to come
[1:26:50] out of his pores
[1:26:54] praying agonizing god let this cup pass
[1:26:58] from me
[1:27:01] but it held
[1:27:06] come down right to the very moment not
[1:27:09] my will
[1:27:10] but thy will be done
[1:27:16] it held and that's what it'll do to
[1:27:19] every christian when you come down to
[1:27:20] something
[1:27:21] not my will lord
[1:27:24] that's a direct sign of the holy ghost
[1:27:27] not my will lord
[1:27:29] but thy will be done
[1:27:33] we'd go down through all the all the
[1:27:36] disciples as they would give their lives
[1:27:38] paul
[1:27:38] peter all those down to the it held it
[1:27:41] held
[1:27:42] it held it held it held
[1:27:46] and the only way it won't help hold
[1:27:49] is if somebody gets in there and messes
[1:27:52] with the prescription
[1:27:54] but if they'll go back to the original
[1:27:58] it'll hold it'll hold in your worst mind
[1:28:01] battle
[1:28:03] brother branham had it his wife had just
[1:28:06] died
[1:28:06] and his daughter was passing away and he
[1:28:09] said a black sheep come down
[1:28:11] and the devil was in his ear
[1:28:14] he said he'd come and set on his
[1:28:16] shoulder that means in his ear
[1:28:18] right there trying to bore his way in oh
[1:28:21] you mean all you did for god
[1:28:23] all the meetings you've held all the
[1:28:26] look what you've given up
[1:28:27] and he's turning his back on you what
[1:28:30] are you gonna do
[1:28:34] brother brown said i was just about
[1:28:37] to say he said all of a sudden something
[1:28:40] deep down
[1:28:42] said though god slay me yet i'll trust
[1:28:45] him
[1:28:49] it held this holy ghost to hold
[1:28:53] it's going to hold to the body change
[1:28:59] let's power it
[1:29:23] he took it himself
[1:29:26] he's not trying to put something on you
[1:29:28] that he don't trust
[1:29:35] he's putting something on you that he
[1:29:37] knows will work
[1:29:39] it'll hold
[1:29:43] i wonder today how many would say lord
[1:29:48] i want to accept you as my shepherd
[1:29:52] i need you as my shepherd lord
[1:29:58] lead me guide me
[1:30:10] maybe somebody can look at their own
[1:30:12] house say you know there's a skunk there

[1:30:18] into my life
[1:30:23] help me move it let me let me just yield
[1:30:25] to you lord and move that thing out
[1:30:29] yes jesus

[1:30:40] he's here to come and he's here to come
[1:30:44] and touch you
