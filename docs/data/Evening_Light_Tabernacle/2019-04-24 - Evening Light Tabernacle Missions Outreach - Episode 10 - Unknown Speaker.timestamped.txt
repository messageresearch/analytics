[0:05] hello everybody we're the ministry team
[0:08] at evening like Tabernacle in Minden
[0:11] Louisiana we're happy that you have
[0:12] joined with us today and hope our
[0:15] discussion will bless you and enlighten
[0:18] you hope you'll get your friends to join
[0:20] with us and let everybody know that
[0:22] we're online and talking about the good
[0:26] word of God and we got some good things
[0:28] to talk about today
[0:29] once more we've been talking about the
[0:33] early church and how that Paul had said
[0:39] and John had said that the Antichrist
[0:41] would come and how he would come with
[0:44] the suction and so on but um he spoke of
[0:48] particularly actually it was John that
[0:52] spoke particularly in the early church
[0:55] leave losing its first love and I think
[0:59] of this is in the book of Revelation
[1:02] chapter 2 verse 2 that Jesus said I know
[1:04] thy works and thy labour and that
[1:07] patience and have that killeth bear with
[1:11] them that which are evil and now has
[1:14] tried them which say they are apostles
[1:16] and are not and have found them liars so
[1:20] we already see that there are imposters
[1:23] in the church and they are claiming the
[1:27] position of ministry of an apostle of
[1:30] apostle means once in right and and are
[1:34] not but they are not but they have found
[1:36] them ours and the early church was
[1:38] contending against these and and and
[1:41] discovering of these false apostles and
[1:45] it goes on but it goes on to say that
[1:48] even Jesus said of that church even
[1:52] though you you've done good you've
[1:54] wasted false apostles but yet I have
[1:58] somewhat against thee because thou has
[2:01] left that first love
[2:03] what do you think he was talking about
[2:07] there seems to be a pattern through the
[2:11] Bible see the book of Judges through
[2:14] revival history that when God visits a
[2:18] generation every time he visits a
[2:21] generation where he reveals a portion of
[2:24] his word or restores the word to a
[2:27] generation it brings revival in other
[2:29] words every revival is built off a
[2:32] revelation of the word brought to a
[2:34] certain something inspired in something
[2:36] and in yes and it returns their hearts
[2:40] back and then they set afire
[2:42] this causes what we would call revival
[2:45] we see it in judges where they would
[2:47] backslide want to be like the other
[2:48] nations and then God would send allow an
[2:51] enemy to come in and chase them and they
[2:53] begin to cry out to God and he would
[2:55] raise up a deliverer and then they would
[2:57] turn back to the Word of God and it
[2:59] would set a revival and then in the new
[3:02] testament church which was paul's age
[3:06] they they receive the Holy Ghost they
[3:10] received the New Testament and for a
[3:12] while they endured and they live
[3:15] victorious over sin they went out
[3:18] preaching the gospel and the power of
[3:20] the Resurrection but just just a brief
[3:24] span and that original fire begins to
[3:28] die down and it isn't anything obviously
[3:33] sinful for but it just begins to take on
[3:37] a formality
[3:38] aa formality the original fire the
[3:42] fervent desire to please God the
[3:44] reaching out in the spirit it all begins
[3:45] to fade and for his word his passion for
[3:48] his word the reaching out into the
[3:50] spirit it begins to fade and and then
[3:54] then the church begins to prospers it
[3:56] begins to grow and it leans towards
[3:58] material things opposed to its spiritual
[4:01] beginning begins to get formal worship
[4:03] you know becomes just a ritual something
[4:06] that we do you know I mean it's Sunday
[4:09] we're gonna go to church this you know
[4:11] it's just a ritual instead of that
[4:13] fervency that and it don't take very
[4:15] many generations for this to happen
[4:17] that's you
[4:19] you know this reminds me Isaiah's
[4:22] prophecy were he you know God said in
[4:26] Isaiah once and I hate you sacrifices I
[4:29] you know I don't want anymore they
[4:31] stitch in my nostril and because they
[4:35] were coming in worshipping actually
[4:37] doing what he said going through the
[4:39] motions of bringing the lamb offered the
[4:42] blood going through the sacrifice but
[4:44] they were doing it without sincerity you
[4:47] know it was now all this is what we do
[4:50] you know it was formerly it had no
[4:52] meaning they may see the person you know
[4:56] the the the lamb could now just be
[5:00] bought in the market and taken and and
[5:02] whatever you know originally they would
[5:05] have raised their lamb and loved that
[5:06] lamb and watched it to grow and and
[5:09] realize this lamb will die in my place
[5:12] for my sins
[5:14] but got a point you know it just now
[5:17] wasn't my religion it was my father's
[5:21] religion something handed down one of
[5:23] y'all mentioned want to go to church
[5:24] growing and and that's a good thing we
[5:28] want we want to see the church grow we
[5:31] want to see people have the opportunity
[5:32] and salvation but what happens is the
[5:35] the new people sitting on the Pew or the
[5:37] people born into a Christian family
[5:39] they're raised up in it but like you
[5:43] said it's there this daddy's religion so
[5:45] this is what I do this is where we've
[5:47] always gone to church so this is where I
[5:49] go and in the lack of fervency I believe
[5:52] is because they haven't had their own
[5:54] experience they're living off the glow
[5:56] of the light of another time you know
[5:59] they're hearing all the stories but they
[6:01] haven't experienced Christ for them
[6:04] cells come on so therefore they're just
[6:07] a church member yeah and when you're
[6:09] just a church member you don't have that
[6:11] love affair with Jesus as many as
[6:15] believed on Christ gave he power to
[6:19] become the sons of God are their
[6:22] grandsons not at all not at all there's
[6:25] only sons you can't be saved
[6:27] because your daddy's the preacher you
[6:30] can't be saved because your
[6:32] today we're the best Christians that
[6:33] ever lived that that in God's eyes
[6:36] doesn't matter that's what I'm you have
[6:39] to meet God you have to have an
[6:41] experience it has to be your sacrifice
[6:43] personal for you for your sins it seems
[6:48] to be a cycle throughout throughout all
[6:50] the ages that God would send an original
[6:54] fire right and then a couple generations
[6:57] after there seems to be an organization
[7:01] around that revival but it looks nothing
[7:04] like the original right yeah that's
[7:06] right and so they're associated with a
[7:08] name that is attached to that revival
[7:10] yeah and they bear record that they're
[7:13] associated with it right but they don't
[7:15] bear the life that came originally and
[7:19] and what's amazing is if we if we used
[7:23] an organization every organization is
[7:26] birth off a genuine revival that took
[7:29] place exactly but history tells us that
[7:34] no organization ever reproduces the
[7:37] original revival hmm in other words the
[7:42] Lutheran Church was a mighty revival
[7:44] that called the people out of the Dark
[7:46] Ages out of Catholicism and the bondage
[7:49] of superstition into the revelation that
[7:53] the just shall live by faith
[7:54] but the Lutheran's have never reproduced
[7:57] another revival like they had at the
[7:59] beginning isn't same with Wesley same
[8:02] through the ages so we see then a
[8:05] pattern and that's a cycle of revival
[8:07] and death that there's a revival only to
[8:09] die off in the next generation yes and
[8:12] and so you know but somewhere we got to
[8:17] break the cycle okay man yeah that's
[8:19] right amen
[8:20] I think every generation has to have a
[8:22] chance at the word every generation has
[8:25] its own revive its own revival a chance
[8:27] at the word that's been it's it's on us
[8:30] as ministers to present them a gospel
[8:33] that would give them a chance that that
[8:35] worked to help create an atmosphere the
[8:37] universe they can be be burped they come
[8:40] to that realization
[8:41] that it's not mama it's not my dad's the
[8:43] preacher of the pastor or a deacon but I
[8:46] know Christ genuinely for myself I have
[8:49] a personal revelation of what he's done
[8:52] for me and I believe that's the desire
[8:54] that we have here's a ministry team to
[8:57] create in this church and I believe we
[8:59] want to see that spread not only from
[9:01] this church but to others while we're
[9:02] doing these episodes is to share the
[9:05] good news and what the power God can do
[9:07] that you don't have to go up to down and
[9:10] have come out of revival only to die you
[9:12] can keep a constant because gotta keep
[9:15] you constant a mess so today a revival
[9:18] really is a protracted meeting we're
[9:20] gonna have a series of services which is
[9:22] our revival but really a church ought to
[9:25] be in constant revival should be on fire
[9:28] for God with the presence of God and the
[9:30] power of God working bringing salvation
[9:33] deliverance healings it ought to be an
[9:36] atmosphere and an expectancy I think
[9:39] people have lost their expectation
[9:42] because they lost their first love and
[9:45] what is that first love what was what
[9:47] was the first love of the first church I
[9:51] believe it was the Word of God the trend
[9:54] man a letter true the last true that's
[9:56] as you see that they lost the love for
[9:59] truth yeah they have no love for true
[10:01] that's right you see that later sin had
[10:04] a good start
[10:05] conforming to the world more than
[10:07] conforming to Christ and they start
[10:09] doing things that they used to wouldn't
[10:12] do it's not doing anything you still
[10:13] used to do that's a yes and before you
[10:16] know it those fires you don't if you
[10:18] don't had a log to fire at I see I mean
[10:21] you've got to keep you feed it you keep
[10:23] nurturing you keep moving on in the word
[10:26] you keep feeding on or you know and
[10:28] that's what happened you know all these
[10:31] false teachers begin to come in and like
[10:33] you said twist it a little bit and those
[10:35] fires begin to die and then they lost
[10:38] that love for the truth you know and
[10:41] then this is this part of what Paul said
[10:44] when he talked about that meant a sin
[10:47] and sitting in the church he said and
[10:50] for this cause God would send a strong
[10:53] delusion
[10:54] because they received not the love for
[10:57] the truth amen and so you know this is
[11:00] when you get the Holy Spirit in your
[11:03] life it gives you love and use your
[11:05] passion it gives you drive for truth yes
[11:09] and for the word of God and for it to
[11:11] have preeminence they asked Jesus what
[11:14] is the great commandment and and he said
[11:17] he said thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[11:20] with all thy heart with all thy soul and
[11:23] with all thy might this is the first and
[11:25] Great Commandment that is the very first
[11:29] and beginnings and in the first church
[11:32] they loved God with all that they sold
[11:35] their possessions they forsook their
[11:37] families they put everything into the
[11:39] gospel and the word had preeminence in
[11:41] the churches and in the lives of the
[11:43] people but shortly after that false
[11:46] apostles begin to move in and move
[11:48] people away from the word which plunges
[11:51] us into 2,000 years of a church ages and
[11:58] there's a lot that takes place in the
[12:01] book of Revelation and it was no
[12:03] surprise to the Lord the Lord spoke very
[12:06] specifically concerning the church and
[12:09] the 2,000 years of history that was
[12:11] going to follow Jesus told us that it
[12:14] would even go into the depths from the
[12:16] depths of God to the very depths of
[12:18] Satan my my and that that's all spelled
[12:22] out right in the book of Revelation in
[12:24] there you know very distinctly and it's
[12:27] a letter to the church which is
[12:28] astounding to me because so many avoid
[12:32] the book of Revelation altogether as
[12:34] though it can't be understood when that
[12:38] book is of vital importance to the
[12:41] church and to leaders of the church and
[12:44] and to this day it actually is the
[12:47] revelation of Jesus Christ
[12:49] exposing the devil for what he is know
[12:52] and telling Jesus said it when he the
[12:55] Holy Spirit of Truth has come he will
[12:57] lead you and guide you into all truth
[12:59] and show you things to come right so you
[13:05] know he's
[13:06] but that those words of losing their
[13:08] first love to the very first church age
[13:10] which was a reason age and that word
[13:14] means to be drifting or relaxed and that
[13:17] they had aimed at the high Collin but
[13:19] then realized God help us not to rely
[13:22] absolutely it was that relaxing that
[13:25] allowed the false teaching that allowed
[13:27] those things to get a foothold in there
[13:29] because if their love for the truth was
[13:32] just as fervent as it had ever been
[13:33] there have been quick to recognize
[13:35] exactly that had been quick to say we
[13:37] won't accept that but because there was
[13:39] a relaxing that's what allowed somebody
[13:41] subtle as a serpent to be able to speak
[13:44] something just a little twisted and then
[13:45] for them to accept it for them to take
[13:47] it down because they had relaxed a
[13:49] little bit their guard was analyzing
[13:51] words and so that that love for the word
[13:55] that first love
[13:56] there was no compromise than that none
[13:59] at all they were not compromise it would
[14:00] be like a husband and wife and their
[14:03] promises to each other in marriage as a
[14:05] hall had presented to Christ a chaste
[14:09] virgin yeah it was a it was a marriage
[14:13] covenant not that word they were married
[14:16] to that word right and they were not
[14:18] going to defile themselves they were not
[14:21] going to compromise that vow that word
[14:23] and so the first love in our life should
[14:29] be the Word of God it's nothing that we
[14:31] that we water down that we compromise
[14:34] that we just interpret or handle loosely
[14:37] but we live by it we defend it we fight
[14:40] for it we preach it you spoke about the
[14:43] book of Revelation you know that really
[14:44] I think the book of Revelation is really
[14:47] if you just kind of summed it all up
[14:49] it's about it's about two women right
[14:53] you know it's about a woman that's gonna
[14:57] be married to the lamb where that it
[14:59] says the marriage of the lamb has come
[15:01] there's somebody you don't because
[15:03] species has to marry species in right
[15:05] kind after kind in that so the lamb the
[15:09] Lamb of God will have a lamb
[15:11] on earth a bride of people who matches
[15:14] him who will be bone of his bone and
[15:16] flesh of his flesh so that's one woman
[15:18] the other woman is this defiled woman
[15:21] yeah and she is called in the book of
[15:24] Revelation very harsh their homes you
[15:27] know something something that we don't
[15:29] like to speak about but the Bible's says
[15:32] leader it says it I mean so when we say
[15:35] what the Bible said he called her a
[15:36] and and that represents a woman
[15:40] who lost her first love and vows to her
[15:44] husband began to think the seed in the
[15:47] seeds of others that was not her husband
[15:50] and when the church you know drifts off
[15:53] with programs and seeds of man and
[15:56] theology and ideas that isn't that isn't
[15:59] firmly scriptural based that church
[16:03] becomes a hole in the body she manifests
[16:07] what Paul feared she that's right
[16:10] I fear yeah I want to present you as a
[16:14] chaste person you know but I fear yeah
[16:16] that's Satan he's gonna beguile you
[16:18] right I did he and and and you know this
[16:22] is true he he actually typed and placed
[16:27] the church as married to Christ and he's
[16:32] you know he said he typed her as a
[16:34] husband and wife relationship and he
[16:37] said about his church he gave himself
[16:40] for it that he might sanctify and
[16:42] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[16:45] by the word that he might present it to
[16:49] himself a glorious day man without spot
[16:53] or wrinkle or any such thing amen but
[16:56] that he should be holy and without
[16:57] blemish so this is God's object he will
[17:01] have a church that is virgin to his word
[17:04] that will be true to him that will give
[17:07] his word the preeminence and and that
[17:10] her headship is not a Pope or you know
[17:16] that district press matters are a
[17:18] denomination but her headship
[17:21] will be Christ the word word and that
[17:23] she'll give that word preeminence that
[17:26] it will have the oversight and the
[17:27] leadership instead of a man-made creeds
[17:30] and dogmas haebang babe when the Lord
[17:33] speaks of his bride he's not gonna say
[17:36] you have lost your first love a man no
[17:38] so he is the husband to this woman
[17:43] the the virgin bride Christ he is her
[17:46] head he is her owner he is her Lord so
[17:51] you know we come back to the the book of
[17:54] Revelation real briefly and he talks
[17:56] about the church and and there he said
[18:00] of this church that that the marriage of
[18:04] the lamb has come and his wife has made
[18:08] herself ready and to her was granted
[18:11] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[18:13] clean and white for this is the
[18:15] righteousness of the same and so God
[18:18] will have a righteous church a man a
[18:20] righteous people that he will be married
[18:23] to United to will be one and he'll take
[18:26] that to a wedding that as we unite with
[18:32] him here but go there to that wedding
[18:34] supper in in the skies is promised to us
[18:37] and then after that a great millennial a
[18:40] man
[18:41] well that he'll will rule and reign with
[18:43] Christ a thousand years what a promise
[18:46] and how we want to be committed today
[18:49] and be that that glorious church without
[18:52] spot over here and that should be the
[18:55] ambition of all of our listeners out
[18:57] there today is let's be that glorious
[19:00] church let's not lose our passion and
[19:02] our drive and praise love for God but
[19:04] have that great desire a heart to do
[19:07] what is right with everything with this
