[0:00] [Music]
[0:05] Take these hands
[0:10] and lift them up.
[0:14] For I have not the strength to praise
[0:17] you near enough.
[0:22] For I am nothing.
[0:26] Oh Lord, I'm nothing.
[0:30] without you.
[0:36] And take my voice
[0:41] and pour it out
[0:43] [Music]
[0:45] and let it sing the songs of mercy I
[0:49] found.
[0:52] For I am nothing.
[0:56] Oh Lord, I'm nothing
[1:00] without you.
[1:04] [Music]
[1:05] And all my soul
[1:11] needs
[1:13] is all your love
[1:17] to cover me.
[1:19] to all the world
[1:24] will see that I am nothing
[1:31] without you
[1:35] [Music]
[1:36] and take my body
[1:41] and build it up.
[1:44] May it be broken as an offering of love.
[1:51] For I am nothing.
[1:55] Oh Lord, I'm nothing
[1:57] [Applause]
[1:58] without you.
[2:01] [Music]
[2:04] And all my soul
[2:09] [Music]
[2:11] is all your love.
[2:15] to cover me.
[2:17] So all the world
[2:22] will see
[2:24] that I am nothing
[2:28] without you
[2:34] and take my time.
[2:38] you're on this earth
[2:41] and let it glorify
[2:44] all that you are worth.
[2:48] For I am nothing,
[2:51] oh Lord, I'm nothing
[2:55] without you.
[3:00] And all my soul
[3:07] is all your love
[3:11] to cover me.
[3:14] So the world
[3:18] will see
[3:20] that I am nothing.
[3:25] Without you all my soul
[3:30] and all my soul
[3:36] is all your love
[3:40] to cover me.
[3:43] And all the world
[3:47] will see that I am nothing
[3:54] without you
[3:57] [Music]
[3:57] [Applause]
[3:59] and take my time.
[4:04] you're on this earth
[4:07] and let it glorify
[4:10] all that you are worth.
[4:14] For I am nothing,
[4:17] oh Lord, I'm nothing
[4:21] without you.
[4:26] And all my soul
[4:31] is
[4:33] all your love
[4:36] to cover me.
[4:39] So all the world
[4:43] will see
[4:45] that I am nothing
[4:50] without you.
[4:55] and take these hands
[4:58] [Music]
[4:59] and lift them up.
[5:03] For I have not the strength to praise
[5:07] you nearly enough.
[5:11] For I am nothing.
[5:14] Oh Lord, I'm nothing
[5:18] [Music]
[5:19] without
[5:20] you.
[5:24] [Music]
