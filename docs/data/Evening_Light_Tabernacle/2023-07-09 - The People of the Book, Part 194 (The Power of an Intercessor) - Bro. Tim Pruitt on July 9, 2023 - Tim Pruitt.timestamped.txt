[1:01:25] and we can help a little church
[1:01:27] somewhere a place somewhere or a group
[1:01:30] of people somewhere wherever they are to
[1:01:33] strengthen the body of Christ that's
[1:01:34] what we want to do amen so God bless you
[1:01:37] as our ministers will be busy this

[1:01:43] different places there's many many needs
[1:01:46] everywhere keep them in prayer I would
[1:01:48] appreciate that please keep me in prayer
[1:01:50] Genesis chapter 18 verse 20 and the Lord
[1:01:54] said because the crying of Sodom and
[1:01:58] Gomorrah is great and because their sin
[1:02:01] is very Grievous I will go down now and
[1:02:04] see whether they have done altogether
[1:02:07] according to the Cry of it which is come
[1:02:11] unto me and if not I will know and the
[1:02:14] men turned their faces from thence and
[1:02:17] went towards Sodom but Abraham stood yet
[1:02:19] before the Lord and Abraham Drew near
[1:02:23] and said wilt thou also destroy the
[1:02:28] righteous with the wicked per Adventure
[1:02:30] there'd be 50 righteous within the city
[1:02:32] wilt thou also destroy and not spare the
[1:02:36] place for the 50 righteous that are
[1:02:38] therein
[1:02:39] that be far from thee to do after this
[1:02:42] manner to slay the righteous with the
[1:02:44] wicked and that the righteous should be
[1:02:47] as the wicked that be far from thee
[1:02:49] shall not the judge of all the Earth do
[1:02:53] right
[1:02:54] and the Lord said if I find in Sodom 50
[1:02:57] righteous within the city then I will
[1:03:01] spare all the place for their sakes
[1:03:03] and Abraham answered and said behold now
[1:03:07] I have taken upon me to speak unto the
[1:03:10] Lord which him but dust and Ashes per
[1:03:14] Adventure there lacked five of the 50
[1:03:16] righteous will thou destroy all the city
[1:03:19] for the lack of five and he said if I
[1:03:22] find there 40 and 5 I will not destroy
[1:03:26] it and he spake unto him yet again and
[1:03:29] said for adventure there be 40 found
[1:03:31] there and he said I will not do it for
[1:03:33] 40's sake and he said unto him oh let
[1:03:37] not the Lord be angry and I will speak
[1:03:39] for adventure there will shall be thirty
[1:03:42] be found there and he said I will not do
[1:03:44] it if I find 30 there
[1:03:47] and he said behold I've taken upon me to
[1:03:50] speak unto the Lord for adventure the
[1:03:52] B20 found there and he said I will not
[1:03:55] destroy it for 20's sake and he said oh
[1:03:58] let not the Lord be angry and I will
[1:04:01] speak but this yet but this once
[1:04:04] per Adventure 10 shall be found there
[1:04:07] and he said I will not destroy it for
[1:04:10] Tim's sake and the Lord went his way and
[1:04:13] as soon as he left communing
[1:04:15] with Abraham and Abraham returned to his
[1:04:19] place God bless you can be seated
[1:04:23] I'm going to speak to you this morning
[1:04:25] on the power of an intercessor
[1:04:30] and after the wonderful promise of
[1:04:33] restoration
[1:04:35] which would include Abraham and Sarah
[1:04:39] being restored to youth again and so
[1:04:43] they could have the promised son and
[1:04:45] after seeing the supernatural display of
[1:04:49] the son of man in his ministry the angel
[1:04:52] of God Discerning Sarah's heart
[1:04:55] and after giving to him the mysteries of
[1:04:58] God and and revealing to Abraham things
[1:05:02] that would have otherwise been hidden
[1:05:05] Abraham was not satisfied with his
[1:05:08] salvation and his restoration only
[1:05:12] but seeing the judgments that is about
[1:05:14] to be false Sodom he begins to intercede
[1:05:19] and begins to plead for the Salvation of
[1:05:22] Sodom and I I really think it was for
[1:05:25] the sake of his nephew lot
[1:05:28] that he had something in mind you know
[1:05:31] and so he he would first start with 50
[1:05:33] and then 45 and then 30 and then 20 and
[1:05:37] finally down to 10 he just whatever he
[1:05:40] wanted to make sure that his nephew lot
[1:05:43] and his family was saved
[1:05:45] and I think that that is to be the
[1:05:48] desire of real Christians we don't want
[1:05:50] to see nobody lost
[1:05:52] because that's really God's desire you
[1:05:56] know he he was not willing that then he
[1:05:58] should perish and even he will show his
[1:06:01] long suffering as in the days of Noah to
[1:06:05] to try to bring in every person and and
[1:06:08] give every person an opportunity we
[1:06:11] serve a merciful god
[1:06:14] he's a god rich in Mercy I know in a day
[1:06:18] in a time where men have have
[1:06:20] misunderstood the breach and try to make
[1:06:22] God a god that is no longer a cry or
[1:06:25] Christ no longer on The Mercy Seat I
[1:06:27] tell you I beg the difference with that
[1:06:29] I believe there's more Mercy in this age
[1:06:32] than any age that there's ever been
[1:06:35] because again as brother Brandon would
[1:06:38] preach as one of the last of his sermon
[1:06:40] that God is rich in Mercy
[1:06:43] but anyway
[1:06:44] um you know here we see Abraham entering
[1:06:48] into a Ministry of intercession
[1:06:52] he was not just willing to let the world
[1:06:55] go by and Sodom burn and everybody'd be
[1:06:58] destroyed without imploring God for the
[1:07:02] lost for those who would be lost in the
[1:07:05] fire and he wanted to see them saved the
[1:07:09] Bible said in James 5 16 that he he says
[1:07:13] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:07:16] righteous man availeth much
[1:07:19] and so there is much power in Believers
[1:07:22] intercession for one another
[1:07:25] you see
[1:07:26] um as he as brother Branham told us and
[1:07:29] believe in God he said there that's the
[1:07:31] reason he said the prayer face shall
[1:07:33] save the sick that's the individual's
[1:07:35] prayer the effects of fervent prayer of
[1:07:38] a righteous man availeth much I know if
[1:07:42] you only knew that in your hand Christ
[1:07:45] gave us the authority with his name
[1:07:48] being Christians the most powerful
[1:07:50] weapon the world has ever known prayer
[1:07:53] it even changes everything it'll change
[1:07:56] the mind of God it did do it after death
[1:07:58] was pronounced to a man he prayed and
[1:08:01] and God told the prophet go back and
[1:08:03] tell him I heard him
[1:08:05] and so he said so their their prayer and
[1:08:09] he said he instructed us hold on now we
[1:08:12] know it doesn't literally change God's
[1:08:15] mind numbers 23 19 says that God is not
[1:08:19] a man that he should lie neither the son
[1:08:22] of man that he should repent for at the
[1:08:25] sad and shall he not do it or hath he
[1:08:28] spoken and shall he not make it good
[1:08:31] so you see this is this is God's nature
[1:08:35] he he cannot change his mind about his
[1:08:38] word he can't go back on his word he
[1:08:40] must do what he said as Samuel spoke of
[1:08:43] him as the the glory of Israel that
[1:08:47] changes One of Israel does not lie or
[1:08:51] change his mind for he is not a man that
[1:08:54] should change his mind so God is forever
[1:08:57] the changeless one of Israel the counsel
[1:09:01] of the Lord stands forever since the
[1:09:04] book of Psalms and malachite says and
[1:09:07] speaks of him as I am Jehovah and I
[1:09:10] change not but do you see it is that God
[1:09:13] will use you through intercession to
[1:09:17] change circumstances in order to fit his
[1:09:21] plans and God wanted a lot saved
[1:09:25] amen God wanted lot saved he didn't want
[1:09:28] him to be lost
[1:09:30] and Abraham responded to God's Desire by
[1:09:34] interceding on his behalf and and and
[1:09:38] and and through Abraham's intercession
[1:09:42] then the lot was saved let's look at the
[1:09:45] Book of James chapter 5 and verse 13 and
[1:09:48] if you'll put it upon the board for us
[1:09:50] ought to see the screen is there any
[1:09:52] among you that is Afflicted let him pray
[1:09:56] is any Mary let him sing Psalms is any
[1:10:01] sick among you let him call for the
[1:10:04] Elders of the church and let them pray
[1:10:06] over him anointing him with oil in the
[1:10:10] name of the Lord
[1:10:12] you see there is this prayer of
[1:10:14] intercession as it goes on in verse 15.
[1:10:17] it says and the prayer of faith shall
[1:10:21] save the sick and the Lord shall raise
[1:10:24] him up and if he hath committed sins
[1:10:27] they shall be forgiven him confess your
[1:10:31] fault one to another pray one for
[1:10:34] another that you may be healed and the
[1:10:37] effects of fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:10:40] man Avail as much so you can see the
[1:10:43] instructions of God you know pray for
[1:10:46] one to one for one another that you may
[1:10:48] be healed and then he tells you that
[1:10:50] that the prayer of the righteous man is
[1:10:53] effective when it's fervent amen when it
[1:10:57] when it approaches God you know with a
[1:10:59] with a right attitude and with fervency
[1:11:03] and believe in his promise now the devil
[1:11:06] don't want us interceding for the needs
[1:11:08] of God's people that's very plain it's
[1:11:11] incred incredible what we have to defend
[1:11:13] this day like I've already mentioned you
[1:11:16] know Christ having left the emergency
[1:11:17] seat of course he hasn't he is still
[1:11:20] there he ever liveth to make an
[1:11:22] intercession on the behalf of those that
[1:11:24] has need we can boldly come to the
[1:11:27] throne of grace to find help in the time
[1:11:29] of need you know he is there again the
[1:11:33] high priest that can be touched by the
[1:11:35] feelings of our infirmity and right now
[1:11:37] his office is the office of the high
[1:11:40] priest as he intercedes on the behalf
[1:11:42] and what's the last member of the bride
[1:11:45] of Christ comes in then he for the
[1:11:48] Gentiles Mercy is over he leaves the
[1:11:50] seed of Mercy he takes his bride out of
[1:11:53] here and judgment comes upon the Earth
[1:11:55] but you don't have to worry about there
[1:11:57] not being any Mercy as long as the bride
[1:11:59] is here she is the very seat of Mercy
[1:12:02] because she is in touch with The Mercy
[1:12:05] Seat in heaven
[1:12:07] now but the devil doesn't want us
[1:12:09] interceding for the needs of God's
[1:12:11] people and it's incredible today what I
[1:12:14] find we have to defend anymore
[1:12:16] you know um you know it just says
[1:12:19] there's teachings against preachers and
[1:12:22] the preaching of the word there are
[1:12:24] those of opposed prayer lines and laying
[1:12:27] on of hands and you know evidently Satan
[1:12:30] don't want God's people ministered to
[1:12:33] hey man because he knows and Minister
[1:12:36] unto them he's going to be cast out
[1:12:39] you know and and yes I I do recognize
[1:12:42] that brother Branham told us that laying
[1:12:44] on our hands is a Jewish tradition but
[1:12:47] so is married to a Jewish termite
[1:12:49] tradition so it's fasting Jewish
[1:12:52] tradition anointing with oil is a Jewish
[1:12:55] tradition praying over the food is our
[1:12:58] Jewish traditions
[1:13:01] all of those are Jewish Traditions even
[1:13:04] communion is a the Passover which is a
[1:13:07] Jewish tradition so you see you see he
[1:13:10] simply speaks of the Gentile Roman
[1:13:14] Centurion which who said to Jesus
[1:13:16] there's no need to come to my house for
[1:13:19] a physical test just speak the word and
[1:13:22] my servants I live and Jesus called that
[1:13:25] great faith and brother Branham
[1:13:28] certainly encouraged the church to to
[1:13:30] anticipate the spoken word but he never
[1:13:33] ever ever forbids laying on of hands
[1:13:38] and back to the matter is I'm a personal
[1:13:40] witness when I sat as a young boy in
[1:13:44] brother bannon's meeting in his last
[1:13:45] public meeting in in other than the the
[1:13:49] um the church there in Tucson but in the
[1:13:52] last campaign that he would have hearing
[1:13:55] which was which in Shreveport we had a
[1:13:58] open prayer line and there in that
[1:14:00] prayer line I watched him as they laid
[1:14:02] hands upon them one after the other by
[1:14:05] the way in that meeting also he had an
[1:14:08] altar caller amen and he would say he
[1:14:11] said I believe in old-fashioned altar
[1:14:13] calls because he said God still moves in
[1:14:16] them
[1:14:17] amen I still believe in those things I
[1:14:21] realize yeah maybe the methodists abused
[1:14:24] them maybe maybe somebody else abuse it
[1:14:26] but they're still the truth there's
[1:14:28] still things that God moves in there's
[1:14:31] still things that we we see God using to
[1:14:34] to bring in the loss and the sick and
[1:14:36] the dying now the book of Hebrews
[1:14:39] chapter 6 it less it lists the
[1:14:43] elementary or foundational doctrines of
[1:14:46] Christ
[1:14:47] and and these doctrines are listed in
[1:14:49] there in Hebrews six and one as
[1:14:52] repentance from dead works of Faith
[1:14:55] toward God uh and of instructions about
[1:14:58] Washings and the laying on of hams and
[1:15:02] the resurrection of the dead and of
[1:15:05] Eternal judgment so we do believe in all
[1:15:08] the fundamental doctrines don't we
[1:15:11] so why do we believe in laying on our
[1:15:13] hands what is wrong with that truly it's
[1:15:16] a doctrine of Christ for in as much he
[1:15:20] told us to baptize in his name he also
[1:15:23] commissioned us to lay hands on the sick
[1:15:26] saying that when we interceded for them
[1:15:29] in that manner they shall recover
[1:15:32] amen so it was a practice not only in
[1:15:36] the Old Testament but it's also a
[1:15:38] practice in the New Testament
[1:15:41] Amen in both covenants it was there it's
[1:15:45] going to be here until the duration
[1:15:49] amen the old man the Old Testament shows
[1:15:52] how that laying on of hands would would
[1:15:54] come to be used in the New Testament
[1:15:56] Church Jesus which was originally went
[1:16:00] laying on the hands was for the passing
[1:16:02] of blessing
[1:16:03] um to formally recognize a leader
[1:16:07] so in numbers 8 and 10 he would bring
[1:16:10] the Levites together before the Lord and
[1:16:14] said when you bring him the Levites
[1:16:15] before the Lord the people of Israel
[1:16:18] shall lay their hands on the Levites
[1:16:22] so you can see here it was a part of
[1:16:25] commissioning
[1:16:26] so laying on our hands is for
[1:16:29] commissioning so that so then again in
[1:16:32] numbers 28 or 27 18 God instructs his
[1:16:36] Moses to lay his hand on Joshua to
[1:16:40] formally recognize him as the new leader
[1:16:44] of a Nation
[1:16:45] so he said take Joshua the son of none
[1:16:49] and a man to whom is the spirit and lay
[1:16:54] the hand upon him
[1:16:57] so you see laying on hands was an act of
[1:17:00] recognition and a passing on a blessing
[1:17:04] to those that God had chosen
[1:17:07] now in Timothy Chapter 5
[1:17:10] um first Timothy Chapter 5 he warns
[1:17:12] Timothy to lay hands on no man suddenly
[1:17:16] now in doing this he is not warning
[1:17:20] against praying for the sick
[1:17:22] but rather to be careful who you ordain
[1:17:25] and who you give positions to in the
[1:17:28] church
[1:17:29] so let's just look at it for a moment so
[1:17:32] we can just kind of settle this and
[1:17:34] clear the air and go forward because I
[1:17:36] believe we're people who are called to
[1:17:38] intercession
[1:17:40] Amen to pray for the sick
[1:17:43] is part of our commission
[1:17:45] amen now first Timothy 5 21 I charged
[1:17:49] thee before God
[1:17:51] um and the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[1:17:53] elect angels that I observe these things
[1:17:55] without preferring one another doing
[1:17:57] nothing by partiality lay hands suddenly
[1:18:01] on no man neither be partaker of other
[1:18:05] men's sins and keep thyself pure
[1:18:10] now this has nothing to do with praying
[1:18:15] for the sick
[1:18:16] this has something to do it's with
[1:18:19] rather ordaining and commissioning
[1:18:22] elders
[1:18:23] and church officials
[1:18:26] so he says don't do nothing hastily
[1:18:30] be careful when you put men into
[1:18:32] position
[1:18:34] amen because again when you when you put
[1:18:37] men in position you become identified
[1:18:39] with them because you recognize them
[1:18:41] officially and they become an official
[1:18:43] representative of the church so you know
[1:18:46] if you've done this hastily and this man
[1:18:49] goes into sin hey you're caught with it
[1:18:52] yeah you're branded with it
[1:18:56] now so in it it's an admission and a
[1:19:00] warning not to be too hasty about
[1:19:03] putting men into positions
[1:19:06] now if you keep it in context with what
[1:19:08] he's saying let's go to verse 17. the
[1:19:11] elders who direct the Affairs of the
[1:19:14] church well are worthy of double honor
[1:19:17] especially those whose work is preaching
[1:19:20] and teaching now I'm reading another
[1:19:21] translation but you get it it said for
[1:19:24] the scripture says do not muzzle an ox
[1:19:27] while it's treadling that treading out
[1:19:29] this the Grain and the worker deserves
[1:19:32] his wages do not entertain an accusation
[1:19:36] against an elder unless it be brought by
[1:19:39] two or three Witnesses but those Elders
[1:19:42] who are sinning you are to reprove
[1:19:45] before reprove before everyone so that
[1:19:49] others may take warning
[1:19:51] and then he says I charge you in the
[1:19:54] sight of God energy and of Christ Jesus
[1:19:57] neglect angels to keep these
[1:19:59] instructions without personality and do
[1:20:02] nothing out of favoritism
[1:20:04] do not be Hasty young laying on our
[1:20:06] hands do not share in the sins of other
[1:20:08] and keep yourself pure so maybe a better
[1:20:12] translation would be it's don't give
[1:20:14] your seal of approval to People Too
[1:20:16] hastily
[1:20:18] you see it's very possible to lay hands
[1:20:21] on people too suddenly too quickly to
[1:20:24] give them a seal of approval before we
[1:20:26] really know them or in part authority to
[1:20:29] them before they're ready for it and
[1:20:32] this was a foolish mistake that that
[1:20:34] will often produce painful consequences
[1:20:38] in the Amplified it says like this do
[1:20:40] not be it do not hurry to lay hands on
[1:20:43] anyone ordaining and approving someone
[1:20:45] from Ministry or an office in the church
[1:20:47] or in reinstating expelled offenders see
[1:20:50] all that's within context of what he's
[1:20:52] talking about and therefore sharing the
[1:20:54] sins of other keep yourself free from
[1:20:57] sin
[1:20:58] so Paul's warning to Timothy to lay your
[1:21:01] hands on no man suddenly has nothing to
[1:21:04] do with praying for the sick
[1:21:06] but rather Clausen into him not to put
[1:21:09] their seal of approval on on to someone
[1:21:12] making or import
[1:21:14] imparting authority to a person you see
[1:21:19] you let me just make it clear you do not
[1:21:22] need to be fearful to share in their
[1:21:26] sins by praying for someone who might
[1:21:30] have hidden sins
[1:21:32] but the church's reputation can be
[1:21:35] tainted with men who are in office who
[1:21:39] are living sinful lives
[1:21:41] and we've all been hurt very badly by
[1:21:45] the sinful action of preachers
[1:21:47] of deacons that we were associated with
[1:21:51] so Paul warns us don't ordain anyone
[1:21:55] hastily
[1:21:57] and he's reiterating the same advice
[1:21:59] that he just gave two chapters later or
[1:22:02] earlier rather in first Timothy 3 and 6
[1:22:04] concerning the office of a bishop or a
[1:22:07] pastor
[1:22:09] and he warned he's not to be a novice
[1:22:12] not to be a newcomer
[1:22:14] not to be untrained not to not to be put
[1:22:18] in the office of of a pastor and he and
[1:22:21] he he doesn't have the experience
[1:22:24] of being a Christian and the reputation
[1:22:26] of being a real child of God with a with
[1:22:30] a with a record behind him he's not to
[1:22:33] be a novice unless to be lifted up with
[1:22:36] pride and fall in the condemnation of
[1:22:38] the devil moreover he must have good
[1:22:41] report of them which are without not
[1:22:43] only within the church but even in the
[1:22:46] even in the community around you we
[1:22:49] don't you know you don't want someone to
[1:22:51] be a bishop or leader or pastor of a
[1:22:54] church and he's done uh nefarious
[1:22:57] business deals out there and cause all
[1:23:00] kinds of trouble in the community and
[1:23:02] you know sin on his life and bad
[1:23:04] reputation because that affects the
[1:23:07] church
[1:23:09] now so again he said he said he must be
[1:23:12] of a good report of them which are out
[1:23:14] let's see fall into reproaching the
[1:23:16] snare of the devil so this one this
[1:23:19] subject is not mourning Timothy about
[1:23:22] the laying on of hands of the sick but
[1:23:25] be very careful when you are
[1:23:28] commissioning others
[1:23:29] and this charge comes from a whole
[1:23:32] section about elders honoring the good
[1:23:36] discipline the bad and and for When
[1:23:40] leaders like Paul or Timothy or others
[1:23:42] in the church formally lay their hands
[1:23:44] on someone for uh to to us them into a
[1:23:49] Ministry or into a new calling they're
[1:23:51] putting their seal of approval on them
[1:23:54] and in some way they share even in their
[1:23:58] fruitfulness or in their failures
[1:24:02] amen so you see when we ordain a man to
[1:24:06] go out and preach the gospel we are
[1:24:08] putting the weight of the whole church
[1:24:10] behind him
[1:24:11] we're playing we're we're giving him our
[1:24:14] recommendation we're sending him out
[1:24:18] Amen to represent us in the Gospel of
[1:24:21] Jesus Christ so you see laying on her
[1:24:25] hands then it's very we've got to be
[1:24:27] very careful not to do this hastily and
[1:24:30] put people in positions that they're not
[1:24:33] supposed to be in but he's not talking
[1:24:35] about me real slow when you pray for
[1:24:41] somebody
[1:24:46] or be careful about praying for people
[1:24:49] because if you pray and you lay hands on
[1:24:52] them and their sin their sinners
[1:24:56] then
[1:24:57] that's their sins come back on you
[1:25:00] that's a much a bunch of malarkey and
[1:25:03] baloney as you can imagine
[1:25:08] otherwise we're about to be we better
[1:25:10] not just pray for anybody I can't even
[1:25:12] pray for Aaron he might be a secret
[1:25:14] Sinner and whatever he's doing might
[1:25:16] come back on me I can't pray for you
[1:25:18] because whatever you're doing might come
[1:25:20] back on me you might be cursed by God
[1:25:22] and who knows I'm I might be trying to
[1:25:24] take the girl so nobody prays for nobody
[1:25:26] forget about laying on hands you just
[1:25:28] don't pray
[1:25:32] you see we come to a point where you
[1:25:35] bind the hand of God
[1:25:38] where you stop the work of the Living
[1:25:41] God who commission us cast out devils
[1:25:44] lay hands on the set they shall recover
[1:25:47] do this with boldness because you're an
[1:25:51] intercessor who can come boldly before
[1:25:53] the tone of Grace and by helping the
[1:25:55] time of need
[1:25:59] so you see laying on the hand's ends
[1:26:02] like anointing with oil or fasting or
[1:26:05] external rituals like communion or or
[1:26:09] water baptism none of that is none of
[1:26:12] that is Magic
[1:26:13] it's a means of Grace
[1:26:15] and it come it accompanies words of of
[1:26:19] commendation and you know and Collective
[1:26:22] prayers of the elders and the Saints for
[1:26:24] those that believe and like baptism the
[1:26:27] the laying on of hands is is an official
[1:26:30] recognition a recognition it's sort of
[1:26:33] like um an initiating right so Paul
[1:26:37] warns us don't be hasty
[1:26:40] and putting people in positions
[1:26:43] but laying on the hands was not only for
[1:26:46] ordaining one to an office
[1:26:49] or for The Healing The Sick but also for
[1:26:52] imparting the Holy Ghost
[1:26:55] for those in the upper room you see the
[1:26:58] Holy Ghost came spontaneously
[1:27:01] and 120 were filled with great power and
[1:27:05] spoke in a Heavenly language
[1:27:07] is that right at the house of Cornelius
[1:27:11] a gentile they received the Holy Ghost
[1:27:14] as Peter was was preaching the word and
[1:27:17] it was not without emotion or without
[1:27:19] feeling for they spoke in tongues and
[1:27:22] prophesied
[1:27:24] in the book of Acts chapter 8 the
[1:27:26] Samaritans who were a mixed Heritage of
[1:27:29] Jews and and Gentiles believed and
[1:27:32] embraced the truth of the word of God so
[1:27:34] they sent Peter and John to come and
[1:27:37] pray for them and the Bible said and
[1:27:39] they laid their hands on them and they
[1:27:42] received the Holy Ghost
[1:27:44] now you can look at that here these
[1:27:47] people had believed
[1:27:49] they had embraced the message
[1:27:53] and yet didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:27:57] right so embracing the message of
[1:28:00] embracing the message and confessing the
[1:28:02] belief in the truth was all that was
[1:28:04] needed then they would not have needed
[1:28:07] Us in for Peter and John to come and
[1:28:09] intercede for them by laying on the
[1:28:11] hands
[1:28:12] wouldn't have been necessary
[1:28:15] again in Ephesus
[1:28:17] the followers of John the John the
[1:28:20] Baptist were told of Christ and his
[1:28:22] resurrection and the coming of the Holy
[1:28:24] Ghost and they had been that were then
[1:28:27] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in
[1:28:29] 19 Verse 6 of Acts and when Paul had
[1:28:34] laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost
[1:28:37] came on them and they spake with tongues
[1:28:41] and prophesied
[1:28:44] so you can see this is exactly what
[1:28:46] happened
[1:28:47] you see Paul Come laid his hands on them
[1:28:50] that's why that we come around the altar
[1:28:52] a lot of times and we have people
[1:28:54] seeking the Holy Ghost and you come and
[1:28:56] pray with them and intercede for them
[1:28:58] amen lay in your hands upon them and
[1:29:01] calling on God and say Lord fill this
[1:29:03] person with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:05] amen now again let me go back over that
[1:29:09] it can come spontaneous as you hear the
[1:29:12] word
[1:29:13] it can come spontaneous and nothing was
[1:29:15] even being preached it was just in one
[1:29:17] mind and one Accord was sitting there
[1:29:19] waiting and the spirit of God fell in
[1:29:22] 120 received the Holy Ghost or it can
[1:29:24] come by laying on the hands
[1:29:29] you see you can't put God in a box
[1:29:34] now
[1:29:35] brother Branham gave an illustration I
[1:29:38] think that is really important to
[1:29:40] understand
[1:29:42] and then the sermon Bob and Kelly had
[1:29:45] brother Branham called a prayer line and
[1:29:47] there he asked ministers to come and
[1:29:50] pray with him
[1:29:51] over the sick
[1:29:54] and he did this pretty often in his
[1:29:56] ministry you know that if you listen to
[1:29:58] any tapes
[1:29:59] because he said I don't want your faith
[1:30:01] built into an evangelist I want you to
[1:30:04] have your faith built in your own Pastor
[1:30:06] he's the man that's going to lead you
[1:30:07] out from here
[1:30:09] so he would get other ministers to come
[1:30:11] and pray with him and and he would say
[1:30:13] now form a double line
[1:30:16] and he expressed his appreciation for
[1:30:18] the ministers and and in doing so he
[1:30:21] said I'm going to tell you it makes me
[1:30:22] proud of my heart grateful to find
[1:30:24] Servants of God that will stand before
[1:30:26] the people and say I'm a witness of this
[1:30:29] gospel too
[1:30:30] so he would call for preachers who also
[1:30:33] believed in Divine Healing to come join
[1:30:35] with him in the prayer line for the
[1:30:38] needs of the people
[1:30:39] amen and then he said I'm glad
[1:30:42] makes me proud in my heart to find
[1:30:44] Servants of God who come and be
[1:30:46] identified
[1:30:48] with Divine Healing and prayer for the
[1:30:50] sick and will stand on the platform with
[1:30:52] me to pray for these so they're men of
[1:30:55] God every one of them that's called of
[1:30:56] God every man called of God's commission
[1:30:58] to lay his hands on the sick and they
[1:31:01] shall recover how many believe that then
[1:31:05] then how you going to fail with from
[1:31:07] getting to pass through an arch like
[1:31:11] this
[1:31:12] so you said you ever notice Solomon
[1:31:14] built the temple listen close when you
[1:31:16] enter the door what happened there were
[1:31:18] Angels carved of olive wood with the
[1:31:21] wings tipping across and every worshiper
[1:31:24] coming to the holy seat come right down
[1:31:28] across the tips of these angels Wings
[1:31:30] right down to the mercy seat right down
[1:31:34] to the altar you know the order of
[1:31:36] Solomon's Temple and he said now what
[1:31:39] an angel is a messenger get a dictionary
[1:31:42] and find out what an angel means some of
[1:31:45] them's Heavenly Messengers some of them
[1:31:47] are Earthly Messengers that God dwells
[1:31:50] in to bring his Earthly message
[1:31:53] amen I'm sitting right behind me is an
[1:31:56] Earthly angel
[1:32:00] amen we call him Aaron Oglesby but he's
[1:32:03] an Earthly Angel a messenger of God
[1:32:07] commissioned of God to to what he said
[1:32:10] they're standing there with their they
[1:32:13] are these are messengers angels of the
[1:32:16] Lord Messengers to you and they're
[1:32:18] standing there with their hands out to
[1:32:20] obey What God Says
[1:32:24] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:32:26] recover
[1:32:29] now I'm going to give you just an
[1:32:30] illustration
[1:32:32] brother Aaron come here I need another
[1:32:34] angel
[1:32:36] so we're going to make a double line so
[1:32:38] I want you to stand right here William
[1:32:40] come up
[1:32:42] yeah you you're William
[1:32:46] you stand right there you're the sick
[1:32:48] one you're approaching the angels it's a
[1:32:52] prayer line
[1:32:54] these are Earthly Angels not Heavenly
[1:32:57] angels angel means messenger now then
[1:33:01] Aaron and I are going to be lifting our
[1:33:03] hands to anoint you and to pray for you
[1:33:07] so you step forward and as you do you're
[1:33:11] coming come on step forward you are
[1:33:13] coming under the Ark of the angel's
[1:33:16] wings
[1:33:18] and we lay hands on the sick and they
[1:33:21] shall recover
[1:33:26] Hallelujah that's exactly the way
[1:33:28] brother Madam taught it
[1:33:30] Angels standing there coming under the
[1:33:34] Ark of the angel's wings and he says
[1:33:37] each of these men have just as much
[1:33:40] anointing to lay hands on the sick as I
[1:33:43] do and every Minister touched him and
[1:33:47] they can touch them as they go by now
[1:33:49] listen to the instructions of the
[1:33:50] Prophet lay your hands
[1:33:53] anoint them or they have why touch them
[1:33:57] because we are following the example of
[1:34:00] Jesus who commissioned us to do it you
[1:34:03] know Jesus most common practice in his
[1:34:05] in healing is to touch it's also
[1:34:09] described as laying on her hands you
[1:34:12] know to be healed let's just look at a
[1:34:13] few of Matthew 8 and 2 catch up with me
[1:34:16] there Matthew 8 and 2 and lo there came
[1:34:18] a leper and worshiped him saying Lord If
[1:34:22] thy wilt
[1:34:23] make me clean
[1:34:26] remember he didn't ever say uh let me
[1:34:28] think about this
[1:34:30] it was the will of God to heal
[1:34:32] and Jesus put forth his hand and touched
[1:34:37] him
[1:34:37] saying I will be thou clean so here's
[1:34:41] one of the few times it was every
[1:34:43] question in the Bible whether or not it
[1:34:45] was God's will to heal and Jesus
[1:34:47] answered positively I will
[1:34:50] be thou clean
[1:34:52] and he touched him and and healed him
[1:34:55] now when Peter's mother-in-law was sick
[1:34:58] the Bible said he touched her hand
[1:35:01] she's sick with a fever
[1:35:03] she touched her hand
[1:35:04] and the fever left
[1:35:06] until there was two Blind Men in Matthew
[1:35:09] chapter 9 he touched her eyes and said
[1:35:12] according to your faith be it unto you
[1:35:16] so that's another key when you're coming
[1:35:18] to a prayer line he didn't according to
[1:35:20] my faith I believe
[1:35:22] but it's going to be according to your
[1:35:24] faith
[1:35:25] what do you believe
[1:35:27] amen you accept the promise of God so
[1:35:29] according to your faith be it unto you
[1:35:31] and the same thing in Matthew 20 Jesus
[1:35:34] had compassion on two Blind Men and he
[1:35:37] touched their eyes and immediately their
[1:35:39] eyes received sight and they followed
[1:35:41] him and Mark says chapter 7 the deaf man
[1:35:44] had he also had an impediment of speech
[1:35:48] he put forth his fingers into his ears
[1:35:51] and he touched his tongue
[1:35:54] think of that here here Jesus what did
[1:35:57] he do he with touch
[1:35:59] laying hands on the sick in this case he
[1:36:03] touched their ears sticking his fingers
[1:36:05] in their ears touched his tongue and he
[1:36:08] spoke clearly you see then he
[1:36:10] commissioned us as he was leaving to
[1:36:14] preach to baptize to cast out Devils to
[1:36:18] bind serpents as Moses did and to lay
[1:36:21] hands on the sick
[1:36:24] so Matthew Mark 16 verse 15 this is the
[1:36:28] Great Commission remember this is only
[1:36:31] given to those to whom the word has been
[1:36:34] opened to so the opening of the word
[1:36:37] entitles us to the to the position to
[1:36:41] finish the Great Commission
[1:36:44] is that right so if you're in the
[1:36:46] opening of the word and you don't
[1:36:47] believe in laying on the hands you ain't
[1:36:49] in the opening the word the book's still
[1:36:51] close to you
[1:36:53] you're still over here in denominational
[1:36:55] Darkness
[1:36:56] look what he said in verse 15 he said go
[1:36:59] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:37:01] to Every Creature I don't care how many
[1:37:04] tells me Don't Preach no more just push
[1:37:07] play I'm going to do what the Bible said
[1:37:09] what Jesus commissioned me to do I'm
[1:37:12] going to preach
[1:37:13] [Applause]
[1:37:14] I don't care if it's a popular opinion
[1:37:17] of the day or not I'm going to do what
[1:37:19] the Bible says I'm going to preach
[1:37:24] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:37:26] be saved he that believeth not shall be
[1:37:29] damned so notice he commissions
[1:37:31] preaching baptism and signs shall follow
[1:37:35] them that believe in my name shall they
[1:37:39] cast out devils they shall speak with
[1:37:42] new tongues well we don't believe in
[1:37:44] that anymore oh yes
[1:37:46] True Believers do
[1:37:48] amen they shall take up serpents and if
[1:37:52] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[1:37:54] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[1:37:58] sick
[1:37:59] with a promise they shall recover
[1:38:03] so in the book of Acts once Jesus
[1:38:07] ascended into heaven his Apostles in
[1:38:10] effect become his hands
[1:38:14] I want to make something clear to you
[1:38:16] Jesus cannot come to this earth
[1:38:20] not at this time
[1:38:23] he said well what about the Rapture no
[1:38:24] we meet him in the era
[1:38:26] his feet never touched the ground until
[1:38:29] he touches the Mount of Olives and the
[1:38:31] Cleveland too that's when he comes back
[1:38:33] with the Saints at the battle of
[1:38:35] Armageddon
[1:38:36] so the word keeps Jesus from coming here
[1:38:42] he cannot come that's what brother
[1:38:43] random said he cannot if you would say
[1:38:46] well you know here's male scars and look
[1:38:48] the long robe in the long hair he said
[1:38:50] any impersonator can do that
[1:38:52] that's not Jesus that's not how we look
[1:38:55] for Jesus in this day now Jesus is here
[1:38:58] but in the form of the Holy Spirit he
[1:39:01] sent his Spirit to anoint man to preach
[1:39:05] the gospel and to fulfill this Great
[1:39:09] Commission that we just read about amen
[1:39:12] preach baptize lay hands on the sick
[1:39:14] cast out Devils speak with new tongues
[1:39:17] all of these things this is what he does
[1:39:19] in his church
[1:39:20] now so he cannot come to Earth he has to
[1:39:25] use your hands
[1:39:27] now here I'm talking about an
[1:39:29] intercessor I'm coming back to Abraham
[1:39:31] for a moment and I want to stop here
[1:39:34] just a moment in the midst of this and
[1:39:36] review you know here here Abraham comes
[1:39:41] right here at this point and he says you
[1:39:44] know he said shall I hide from Abraham
[1:39:46] what I'm going to do and he reveals to
[1:39:49] him the mystery he tells him about the
[1:39:50] burden of Sodom he does all of this on
[1:39:54] there God did not do anything on Earth
[1:39:59] until he spoke with Abraham
[1:40:08] then
[1:40:11] he interceded
[1:40:13] as Abraham pleaded for him to do it
[1:40:17] so Abraham's
[1:40:19] Abraham's intercession as a priest moved
[1:40:23] God to save lot
[1:40:27] now God was going to save lot
[1:40:30] but he needed Abraham to intercede
[1:40:34] you see because he had he had a prophet
[1:40:37] on Earth he had a vessel on Earth
[1:40:40] through which he was going to do his
[1:40:41] work through
[1:40:42] somebody help me preach now amen you see
[1:40:46] we are heirs and Joint heirs with Christ
[1:40:50] so brother Madam tells us he says you
[1:40:53] see if you were in the foreknowledge of
[1:40:55] God you are part of God and you're
[1:40:58] becoming becoming a part of God and the
[1:41:01] only way you can be a Son of God or
[1:41:03] daughter of God you have to be a part of
[1:41:05] God and God is not complete without you
[1:41:12] so if unless there are men praying God
[1:41:15] can't work
[1:41:18] unless there have been Inner City
[1:41:21] God can't move
[1:41:26] unless listen he's not going to come and
[1:41:30] lay hands on you no he filled me and
[1:41:33] others with the spirit to do that
[1:41:36] and for us to refuse to do that is to
[1:41:39] thwart the work of God to refuse to give
[1:41:42] our hands to him to use
[1:41:46] now I want you to think of this because
[1:41:48] he said he is incomplete without you so
[1:41:52] you know he has them to use your hands
[1:41:55] he cannot come here he cannot walk down
[1:41:58] these aisles and come lay hands on you
[1:42:00] but he has sons of God that are here
[1:42:03] through whom he works
[1:42:06] now I I want to just kind of go over a
[1:42:09] couple of things right here you know
[1:42:10] John John Wesley said God does nothing
[1:42:14] but an answer to prayer
[1:42:18] so I want you to understand the power of
[1:42:21] intercession if you want God to move
[1:42:22] start praying
[1:42:27] Abraham don't be satisfied with one
[1:42:30] prayer if you don't think he got it that
[1:42:32] first time go again
[1:42:36] come on Amen if you don't think you got
[1:42:39] through that type of go again
[1:42:41] keep going until you're sure and you're
[1:42:43] satisfied that you're going to get the
[1:42:46] answer
[1:42:52] you see brother Benham told us and see
[1:42:54] not out with this shot said we become
[1:42:57] too much like Hawks and not like eagles
[1:42:59] so he said you know there again we
[1:43:02] voltarized down and we're too soft for a
[1:43:04] prayer meeting
[1:43:06] can't pray five minutes anymore
[1:43:10] you see because part of our work here on
[1:43:13] the Earth
[1:43:14] is to him to call to bring God's power
[1:43:18] through intercession to work upon the
[1:43:21] Earth
[1:43:23] there's power in prayer
[1:43:25] there's power in your prayer
[1:43:27] you know
[1:43:29] Abraham you're the heir to the Earth
[1:43:32] and God did not do anything until he
[1:43:35] comes and consults or speaks with
[1:43:38] Abraham and God's not going to move
[1:43:41] until you start calling for him
[1:43:47] amen I'm trying to get you to understand
[1:43:49] you've got a part in this
[1:43:52] you've got a part to play
[1:43:54] God Made You
[1:43:56] heirs together with him
[1:43:59] right amen so if you're an heir with him
[1:44:02] you've got a part in this to do
[1:44:07] oh yes that but there's one interceder
[1:44:09] but in the inner Seasons interceded
[1:44:12] between God and man that's the man
[1:44:13] Christ Jesus yes I get that he's the
[1:44:16] only one worthy to take our petitions
[1:44:18] and bring them into the presence of God
[1:44:21] but you are the man you are the man who
[1:44:24] comes to and women that comes to Jesus
[1:44:26] Christ as a man
[1:44:28] who understands your human frailties
[1:44:32] listen that's why his approach there in
[1:44:34] the heavens is not as Spirit God
[1:44:37] no man can come to spirit of God the
[1:44:40] Father except by Me Jesus said
[1:44:43] so you see our approach to God the
[1:44:46] Avenue that we have is through another
[1:44:48] man and that man is Christ Jesus
[1:44:53] because
[1:44:55] he don't
[1:44:56] our relationship with him is not like an
[1:45:00] invisible God that you know never was
[1:45:02] human never knew our problems never knew
[1:45:05] how they felt to be sick didn't know how
[1:45:07] it feels to be betrayed didn't know how
[1:45:09] it feels to be tempted
[1:45:13] God came flesh so that we would have an
[1:45:18] advocate
[1:45:19] that understands us
[1:45:22] amen that understands us and we when we
[1:45:25] call oh Jesus I'm sick he understands
[1:45:29] he said brother it's him he never had my
[1:45:31] problem listen when he went to hell he
[1:45:34] defeated every problem
[1:45:38] no he never had my headache when he was
[1:45:41] damaged with crown of thorns jammed on
[1:45:43] his head there he had the worst headache
[1:45:46] that they beat him with the rods on the
[1:45:48] head he knows what it is I have a
[1:45:50] headache
[1:45:51] well my back hurts he knows he was on
[1:45:54] the cross he knows what it means to have
[1:45:57] a backache
[1:45:58] while my legs are hurting my feet are
[1:46:01] hurting he knows what it is so I have
[1:46:03] feet hurting electric he whether he's
[1:46:06] suffering It Off
[1:46:08] so that you can come to him as a priest
[1:46:11] that understands your condition
[1:46:14] not a distant God who don't know how it
[1:46:18] feels to be human but God became human
[1:46:26] Hallelujah he became human
[1:46:30] so that you could approach him
[1:46:33] now
[1:46:37] brother Branham tells us
[1:46:39] in a couple of things in Faith and
[1:46:42] Action
[1:46:43] he says Jesus looked on the Harvest
[1:46:46] how many believes he was the lord of the
[1:46:48] Harvest he looked on the Harvest and
[1:46:50] said pray ye the Lord the Harvest to sin
[1:46:52] labors into his Harvest now in other
[1:46:55] words you ask me just what I know that's
[1:46:59] got to be done but yet you've got to ask
[1:47:02] me for it
[1:47:06] come on
[1:47:09] when John when John heard him say
[1:47:13] um I you know behold I come quickly and
[1:47:16] he makes the last Prayer in the Bible
[1:47:17] what does he do he responds to the word
[1:47:20] and said he said even so come Lord Jesus
[1:47:25] do you know did bride of Christ has got
[1:47:28] to be making that prayer the last prayer
[1:47:30] the Bible has got to be the drive of
[1:47:33] their heart
[1:47:35] listen things are coming upon us like a
[1:47:38] trap
[1:47:39] amen and snap and sat on your freedoms
[1:47:42] and everything else and the world is
[1:47:45] these sodomites and these these uh drag
[1:47:48] queens marching down the streets
[1:47:50] screaming we're coming after your kids
[1:47:52] it's not an empty threat
[1:47:56] I tell you it's not an empty threat
[1:47:59] but I'll tell you the Bible said that
[1:48:01] there are those who are going to escape
[1:48:03] the things that are coming on the earth
[1:48:05] and will not be caught in the end time
[1:48:07] trout
[1:48:10] so the prayer of the Believers got to
[1:48:12] become even so calm Lord Jesus
[1:48:17] in other words your attitude about the
[1:48:19] coming has got to come the same as his
[1:48:23] your longing has got to meet his longing
[1:48:27] brother Brandon said do you know that
[1:48:29] there are some things that we have to do
[1:48:31] that God cannot do to until we do it
[1:48:38] he talks about me in the vine and then
[1:48:41] us the branches and then bearing the
[1:48:44] fruit
[1:48:45] he said he furnishes the energy
[1:48:47] but we've got to do we got to do the job
[1:48:52] he talks about the Harvest again and he
[1:48:55] says he could not do it until they asked
[1:48:59] him to do it
[1:49:01] you say well why is that is because he
[1:49:04] listened to me because he Partnerships
[1:49:07] with you
[1:49:12] his partnership with you we are the
[1:49:15] wonderful sermon on Esther the other day
[1:49:17] when when Brother David Seiler preached
[1:49:19] but listen the king did nothing
[1:49:23] for them until Esther stood up and took
[1:49:27] our position
[1:49:33] you know it needs we need sons of God
[1:49:35] exposing the devil and saying that
[1:49:38] Wicked hangman that Wicked cancer that
[1:49:42] Wicked devil that wicked porn that
[1:49:45] Wicked evil there
[1:49:46] [Applause]
[1:49:48] we need people bringing it before God
[1:49:50] and saying God we you know if we if you
[1:49:54] don't do something we're going to perish
[1:49:56] and it's the truth
[1:49:58] if the Rapture don't take place we're
[1:50:00] gonna perish
[1:50:02] we need a rapture we need people calling
[1:50:06] on God come Jesus come Jesus don't leave
[1:50:11] me here whatever you do don't leave me
[1:50:13] here
[1:50:14] [Applause]
[1:50:23] so you see
[1:50:26] God made it that way
[1:50:28] where that that we we would be his hands
[1:50:31] his feet
[1:50:32] I want you just to get some of this for
[1:50:34] a moment
[1:50:35] Brother Brad was sitting now listen to
[1:50:37] this God Is So arraigns it that his
[1:50:41] program cannot move without you and I
[1:50:44] and as long as we're not doing what God
[1:50:48] leads us to do we're paralyzing his
[1:50:51] program
[1:50:53] but when the church moves by the
[1:50:55] anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're
[1:50:58] in God's will
[1:50:59] doing his program
[1:51:04] again he Partnerships you
[1:51:07] he said the thing about it is
[1:51:10] he said we are he says we have received
[1:51:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that makes
[1:51:16] us a part in relationship with God
[1:51:18] that's born again a son and daughter of
[1:51:20] God tell him out of the Bible they'll
[1:51:22] believe it but the thing of it is
[1:51:25] they forget who they are they think well
[1:51:28] I don't know well brother oh brother you
[1:51:30] that's born again Sons and Daughters of
[1:51:33] God
[1:51:34] is it going to choke you co-equal with
[1:51:37] Jesus Christ
[1:51:39] in his presence
[1:51:43] amen oh my that's what makes the devil
[1:51:46] angry and Let the Church of God realize
[1:51:49] who they are
[1:51:52] amen listen what do you what did the
[1:51:54] king say to ask her I'll give you
[1:51:56] everything even half of the even to half
[1:51:59] the kingdom
[1:52:03] listen listen church this is what he's
[1:52:06] endowed his bride with
[1:52:08] you say oh well what the King was going
[1:52:11] to do he's going to take him he's going
[1:52:13] to take a razor and divide the Kingdom
[1:52:14] right in half no that's not what he was
[1:52:16] saying
[1:52:18] he was saying we are will reign together
[1:52:22] Esther
[1:52:26] amen we will reign together you know the
[1:52:29] law has been written amen all men have
[1:52:33] sinned and fallen short of the glory of
[1:52:35] God but write the book write it and
[1:52:38] avenge your enemies
[1:52:40] and The Last Enemy that's got to be
[1:52:42] revenge is death
[1:52:45] and somebody in this generation is gonna
[1:52:49] defeat death
[1:52:53] Hallelujah
[1:52:55] they'll defeat death hell and the grave
[1:52:58] because hell has come here in this
[1:53:01] dimension
[1:53:02] we'll defeat it we are the defeaters
[1:53:06] this is where God is doing he's moving
[1:53:09] it
[1:53:10] he says
[1:53:11] isn't it strange that God wants his
[1:53:13] people to have part into it
[1:53:15] Jesus looked to the Harvest and he says
[1:53:19] pray you the Lord the Harvest that was
[1:53:21] him pray to me I'll send labors into my
[1:53:24] Harvest it's some part you have to do
[1:53:27] God is waiting for his church to call on
[1:53:30] him he's always did it God is waiting
[1:53:33] today for the people to call his servant
[1:53:35] into action and the servant can't get
[1:53:38] into action until the people praise
[1:53:43] you either believe that or you don't
[1:53:45] I believe it
[1:53:47] amen
[1:53:49] listen let me just share one more with
[1:53:51] you he said see we're Buddies
[1:53:56] it's a church we've got something to do
[1:53:59] ourselves
[1:54:00] you got something to do here's the
[1:54:02] gospel I know it but if you just sit
[1:54:05] here and don't preach it
[1:54:07] what good is it going to do
[1:54:11] going to do you've got to something
[1:54:13] you've got to do to make an effort he
[1:54:15] said well I believe God can heal I mean
[1:54:17] I just don't know stand up and let that
[1:54:20] word become your word believe it don't
[1:54:23] reason it just believe it
[1:54:25] so you see God God the prophet of God
[1:54:29] said we're Buddies
[1:54:31] this is what Abraham was a friend of God
[1:54:35] and as a friend he said won't you do
[1:54:37] right you're going to destroy this but
[1:54:40] what about the righteous there
[1:54:42] you you can't destroy the righteous with
[1:54:45] the wicked you will want the god of
[1:54:47] Heaven do right
[1:54:50] well what about your lost loved ones
[1:54:54] come on life never was a part of the
[1:54:57] royal seed
[1:54:59] but he was a part of redemption
[1:55:02] I want you to get this we have the
[1:55:04] church that'll go through tribulation
[1:55:06] when's the last time you prayed for your
[1:55:09] neighbor
[1:55:10] when is the last time you encouraged
[1:55:13] someone just in their walk with God or
[1:55:15] they don't go to our church they're not
[1:55:17] bright people listen what if they just
[1:55:19] go into the tribulation they're going to
[1:55:21] be there and your testimony
[1:55:24] encouragement
[1:55:30] Don't Close Your Heart and say a Spore
[1:55:33] no more every member in the Lamb's Book
[1:55:36] of Life is valuable whether it's the
[1:55:38] bride whether it's the Buddhist virgin
[1:55:40] whether it's 144 000 they're all
[1:55:43] valuable
[1:55:44] [Applause]
[1:55:46] foreign
[1:55:51] now
[1:55:53] coming back here
[1:55:54] once Jesus ascended into heaven
[1:55:57] his Apostles in effect become his hands
[1:56:00] now
[1:56:02] they like the Lord to heal with touch
[1:56:07] come on we know there's nothing in the
[1:56:09] flesh of man it's doing what God Said do
[1:56:14] it's being the conduit through which the
[1:56:18] spirit of God can move as an intercessor
[1:56:21] God could God could have done everything
[1:56:23] he did down at Sodom without Abraham but
[1:56:26] he wouldn't
[1:56:28] he said I want you to have a part of
[1:56:30] this
[1:56:31] and once the Mysteries were revealed to
[1:56:33] him it made him an intercessor
[1:56:37] it gave him a concern for the Lost
[1:56:42] even if they wasn't going to be bride
[1:56:46] he had concern for the Lost
[1:56:53] now
[1:56:55] so
[1:56:57] ananas
[1:56:59] would lay his hands on Paul
[1:57:01] three days after the Damascus
[1:57:03] experienced and restored his sight
[1:57:06] in turn
[1:57:08] Paul
[1:57:09] his hands became channels of
[1:57:12] extraordinary miracles
[1:57:15] but lay his hands on the sick man that
[1:57:17] malt and heal him
[1:57:20] the Bible said he did Mighty Works to
[1:57:22] the laying on of his hands
[1:57:25] this is what Jesus said would happen in
[1:57:28] John 15 he said I'm the vine you are the
[1:57:31] branches you will bear the fruit of the
[1:57:33] Vine
[1:57:34] so he tells us in the inside man we are
[1:57:37] God's fruit bearers and I believe Saint
[1:57:39] John 17 you are the branches he was
[1:57:41] divine the Divine puts for the branches
[1:57:44] but the branches has to Bear the fruit
[1:57:45] if the branch is getting the life out of
[1:57:47] the vine well it's the same kind of life
[1:57:49] that's in the vine don't you think so it
[1:57:51] has to be now our hands
[1:57:54] look at your hands
[1:57:56] our lips
[1:57:58] our eyes them are God's hands
[1:58:03] lips and eyes that he has here on the
[1:58:08] Earth
[1:58:09] now he's gone back to God and he's sent
[1:58:12] forth his energy of his Spirit to anoint
[1:58:14] us with the Holy Spirit and that if
[1:58:17] we'll submissive to him and then our
[1:58:19] hands represent his hand that's the
[1:58:21] reason they shall lay hands
[1:58:24] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:58:28] and hear you him he says it like this
[1:58:31] God always
[1:58:33] in great feeling toward his people meets
[1:58:37] in the counsel of man
[1:58:39] God only works through his church
[1:58:46] are you getting this
[1:58:48] the church is God's agency
[1:58:52] he said in one place in the gospel I'm
[1:58:54] the binder of the branches the vine does
[1:58:56] not bear the fruit it purges the Branson
[1:58:57] Branch bears fruit so the church is the
[1:59:00] branch that the holy spirit is working
[1:59:03] through he speaks through the pastor's
[1:59:05] lips he works through his hands and
[1:59:09] through Divine gifts he sets his body
[1:59:11] into emotions led by the Holy Spirit by
[1:59:14] emptying himself out and letting the
[1:59:16] Holy Spirit take control he brings
[1:59:18] messages he sees visions
[1:59:21] and great things no matter what it might
[1:59:24] be that God has chosen to do if he'll
[1:59:27] yield to the spirit God will work
[1:59:28] through him or any member of his church
[1:59:33] because as he pours out his spirit all
[1:59:37] men shall drain dreams and young men
[1:59:40] shall see visions
[1:59:43] amen
[1:59:45] my sons and my daughters they will
[1:59:47] prophesy
[1:59:49] somebody help me preach now
[1:59:51] so you see God as he says and we would
[1:59:53] see Jesus God in Christ reconciling the
[1:59:56] world and himself God can find himself
[1:59:58] to one body
[2:00:01] that was his son through the death of
[2:00:03] his son God brought the entire it
[2:00:06] brought God to the entire church
[2:00:07] Universal through the sanctifying power
[2:00:10] of the Holy Spirit and through the blood
[2:00:13] of Christ cleanses mortal man and makes
[2:00:15] them not in themselves but by the grace
[2:00:17] of God through his grace make some
[2:00:19] subjects of the holy spirit that he
[2:00:21] talks and walks and preaches and acts
[2:00:24] through his church his Vine his branches
[2:00:27] that's connected in him
[2:00:31] amen
[2:00:32] again in perseverance brother Branham
[2:00:36] talked about the Harvest again where he
[2:00:38] said you prayed that the lord of the
[2:00:40] Harvest was sin labors and he said he
[2:00:43] made himself
[2:00:45] we're making himself with man so bound
[2:00:47] together
[2:00:49] that he works only to the agency of man
[2:00:51] he chose man to work for me he could
[2:00:53] have chose his son to preach the gospel
[2:00:55] he could have chose the Winds of the
[2:00:57] trees or the stars but he chose man and
[2:01:00] he veils himself inside and hides
[2:01:02] himself from the unbeliever and reveals
[2:01:05] himself to whom he will
[2:01:08] amen
[2:01:09] again
[2:01:11] he says
[2:01:13] and thou art a prophet
[2:01:15] but he couldn't do no more for you
[2:01:18] than what he's than what he can working
[2:01:21] through his church right now
[2:01:25] the message Witnesses he said Jesus
[2:01:28] Christ is in the building
[2:01:30] I believe that this morning
[2:01:33] it meant to perform Miracles I believe
[2:01:35] that too
[2:01:36] but he does it through his church his
[2:01:39] people
[2:01:40] they shall lay hands on the sick they
[2:01:42] shall recover in my name they shall cast
[2:01:43] out evil spirits the commission given
[2:01:45] the church that's what's the matter with
[2:01:47] the church today it doesn't know its
[2:01:49] position if you knew positionally what
[2:01:53] you was and what you are there would not
[2:01:56] be a feeble person in here in the next
[2:01:58] five minutes that's right the thing of
[2:02:00] it is you're looking off into a
[2:02:02] millennium for something to happen out
[2:02:03] there when it's already here now we are
[2:02:06] the sons of God no we will be we are
[2:02:09] right now right this minute we're seated
[2:02:11] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:02:13] Jesus now
[2:02:15] oh if you could just recognize that and
[2:02:19] the supreme authority
[2:02:21] that Jesus has given to every believer
[2:02:25] anything you'd desire of that you need
[2:02:28] only thing you have to do is ask and
[2:02:31] receive it whatsoever thing you desire
[2:02:33] When you pray believe you receive it
[2:02:35] it'll be given to you that's true
[2:02:38] whatsoever thing you desire When you
[2:02:39] pray believe it you receive it you shall
[2:02:41] have it you see all through the book of
[2:02:43] Acts
[2:02:46] and let me say about the book of Acts
[2:02:48] that was not the Acts of the Apostles
[2:02:51] that was the acts of the holy spirit in
[2:02:54] the apostles
[2:02:55] is that right so when we talk about a
[2:02:57] book of Acts Church we're not talking
[2:02:59] about fickle men who are fighting argue
[2:03:02] and thus and debating this and that and
[2:03:05] how quarrels in the church and
[2:03:06] dissensions and we're not talking about
[2:03:08] man we're talking about the Holy Spirit
[2:03:12] and God's going to have a book of Acts
[2:03:15] Church
[2:03:15] let me rephrase that God has right now
[2:03:20] at evening like Tabernacle the bride
[2:03:23] around the world a book of Acts Church
[2:03:27] amen where the Holy Spirit Acts
[2:03:32] he's not stale he's not stagnant
[2:03:36] he's not dead he's not passages he acts
[2:03:40] he acts
[2:03:44] Hallelujah
[2:03:45] and his church is Jesus Christ in action
[2:03:50] on the Earth
[2:03:53] now so all through the book of Acts
[2:03:55] where the Holy Spirit was moving through
[2:03:58] the apostles
[2:03:59] God healed to the
[2:04:01] to the laying on of hands
[2:04:04] transferring by intercession the
[2:04:08] Redemptive blessings of Calvary through
[2:04:10] the hands of redeemed men
[2:04:14] it is the New Testament way among both
[2:04:17] Jews and gentiles
[2:04:20] now and I prove that by the Bible
[2:04:24] somebody with me
[2:04:26] now so we we the thing of it is is we
[2:04:30] are not just to have an organizational
[2:04:33] life
[2:04:34] this was not another denomination this
[2:04:37] is not just another two where you're a
[2:04:39] church where you occupy a pew
[2:04:42] amen you might chew too if you're
[2:04:44] chewing gum but
[2:04:45] spit it out and let's get to church
[2:04:48] but nevertheless you know God is we're
[2:04:51] we're not just to occupy Pew we got a
[2:04:54] job to do
[2:04:57] you a congregation or to bring the Holy
[2:05:00] Spirit down
[2:05:01] through intercession
[2:05:04] through psalms to praise through worship
[2:05:07] through prayers
[2:05:12] brother Brandon would say I can't do
[2:05:14] nothing until he's here
[2:05:16] and we can't do anything until he's here
[2:05:21] now he was already there but that was
[2:05:23] served to be worshiped and and to be and
[2:05:25] for the preaching of the word but then
[2:05:27] he would come there to heal the sick
[2:05:30] now in the Statue of perfect man brother
[2:05:32] Brandon said we are not building an
[2:05:34] organization
[2:05:36] remember this we're not just going to
[2:05:39] become another denominational Church
[2:05:41] just uh you know organizational members
[2:05:44] he said Christ never sent me to build an
[2:05:48] organization Christ sent me to build
[2:05:51] individuals
[2:05:53] to the statue of Jesus Christ
[2:05:56] that they might be the powerhouse
[2:06:00] and the dwelling place of the Spirit by
[2:06:02] his word by his words he build up the
[2:06:04] individuals of that place not build an
[2:06:06] organization to a greater denomination
[2:06:08] but to build the individual to Sons and
[2:06:11] Daughters of God that's what God wants
[2:06:13] in this day is Samson God of sons and
[2:06:16] donors of God operating by the spirit of
[2:06:18] God
[2:06:20] I'm going to get them to some of the
[2:06:22] nuts and bolts of this in just a minute
[2:06:23] but let's let's just review a little
[2:06:25] more of the Bible at Iconium which was a
[2:06:29] city and Asia Minor known now as turkey
[2:06:33] Paul and Barnabas Minister dare acts 14
[2:06:36] and verse 3 they remained there a long
[2:06:39] time speaking boldly for the Lord Who
[2:06:42] Bore witness to the word of his grace
[2:06:45] granting signs and wonders to be done by
[2:06:49] their hands
[2:06:52] um
[2:06:52] among the Jews
[2:06:54] and the Gentiles in age of verse Chapter
[2:06:58] 19 Verse 11. God wroughts special
[2:07:01] Miracles by the hands of Paul
[2:07:04] I'm showing you this is New Testament
[2:07:06] Doctrine
[2:07:09] Bible Way
[2:07:11] so that from his body were brought into
[2:07:13] the sick
[2:07:15] handkerchiefs or aprons and diseases
[2:07:18] departed from them so not only did he
[2:07:20] lay hands on them but the things that he
[2:07:22] was the things that he was wearing are
[2:07:24] holding there was taken and put on the
[2:07:27] sick
[2:07:28] and the diseases departed from them the
[2:07:31] evil spirits went out of them because
[2:07:33] that's what healing does
[2:07:35] cast out devils remember Paul and the
[2:07:38] apostles they are the they are the
[2:07:40] pattern of every god-called minister
[2:07:43] amen if you're not laying hands on the
[2:07:46] sick you're not a god-called minister
[2:07:48] that's just it one of the last recorded
[2:07:51] miracles in the book of actses in Acts
[2:07:54] 28 28 chapter 28 verse 8. it happened
[2:07:58] that the father
[2:07:59] published lay sick with fever and
[2:08:02] dysentery
[2:08:03] and Paul visited him and prayed and put
[2:08:06] in his hands on him healed him
[2:08:09] hmm
[2:08:10] so you can see right now what what it is
[2:08:12] all the way down through it's the
[2:08:15] pattern of the Bible whether they were
[2:08:17] Jews or whether they were gentiles
[2:08:20] sure sure we we ought to believe in a
[2:08:23] greater way I'd like to see your faith
[2:08:25] rise where you're just right in your
[2:08:27] seat you're healed I've seen it happen
[2:08:29] I've seen people filled with the Holy
[2:08:31] Ghost right in their seats I have
[2:08:34] preached in meetings and demons would
[2:08:36] fall out right there and be that people
[2:08:38] delivered right there as I ministered
[2:08:41] the word
[2:08:42] amen I remember Ellis Blake years ago he
[2:08:46] he when I backslid took up cigarettes
[2:08:49] again had a two pack a day habit or more
[2:08:51] and he'd come back in church and there
[2:08:54] you know his backslidden under
[2:08:56] condemnation and everything but while I
[2:08:59] was preaching one morning the Holy
[2:09:01] Spirit fell down in that place and he
[2:09:04] screamed out I'm delivered I'm delivered
[2:09:06] I'm delivered and never to smoke again
[2:09:10] that's the power of the Gospel going
[2:09:13] forth but I've also seen it where we lay
[2:09:15] hands
[2:09:18] of the sick of the oppressed on the
[2:09:22] demon my press and they recover
[2:09:27] I'll get to in a minute God don't just
[2:09:29] have a gift of healing he has gifts of
[2:09:32] healing
[2:09:36] now brother Bradham in Be not Afraid
[2:09:39] this is after the seals in Tucson
[2:09:42] now I want you to believe
[2:09:44] but first I want you to see that now
[2:09:46] like healing we know the holy spirit is
[2:09:48] here and I believe in laying on the
[2:09:51] hands
[2:09:52] somebody oh jumped on me kind of rough
[2:09:55] about that this morning there's no such
[2:09:57] a thing as people laying hands on one
[2:09:59] another it shouldn't be done can you
[2:10:01] imagine
[2:10:02] some
[2:10:03] some Candlelight
[2:10:07] preacher spirit
[2:10:10] are you with me Campbell light that's
[2:10:12] Church of Christ I call a man of Christ
[2:10:14] because they don't because they're
[2:10:16] Antichrist anti-anointing
[2:10:19] so I don't call them Church of Christ I
[2:10:21] call them Church of antichrist because
[2:10:23] they're anti-anointing
[2:10:25] they don't believe in praying for the
[2:10:27] sick they don't believe God heals they
[2:10:29] believe all that gives us path that
[2:10:31] sounds like a lot of message Believers
[2:10:32] today that become Church of the
[2:10:34] Antichrist
[2:10:36] says you know this man jumped on him
[2:10:39] about saying they're kind of rough
[2:10:43] there's no such a thing as people laying
[2:10:45] hands on one another it shouldn't be
[2:10:47] done
[2:10:47] now can you imagine
[2:10:49] the evil spirit in a man that would
[2:10:52] attack God's Prophet for laying on hands
[2:10:57] and he said I said well you just haven't
[2:11:00] read the Bible brother
[2:11:02] that's all said the last commission that
[2:11:04] fell from the lips of Jesus Christ was
[2:11:06] lay hands on the sick they shall recover
[2:11:08] that's the last word she said when he
[2:11:11] left the Earth
[2:11:12] his first commission he gave the
[2:11:14] disciples was heal the sick cleanse the
[2:11:17] leopards raise the Dead cast out Devils
[2:11:19] first group is sent out Matthew 10. the
[2:11:22] last group he sent out these signs have
[2:11:23] all of them that believed they said cast
[2:11:25] out devil speak with new tones take up
[2:11:27] serpents drink deadly things if they lay
[2:11:29] hands on the sick they shall recover
[2:11:31] that's the last words he said and was
[2:11:33] received up in the glory certainly
[2:11:35] that's a Great Commission what it does I
[2:11:38] don't know it says care not what he said
[2:11:41] do
[2:11:43] amen and of course as I said that's not
[2:11:46] the only way God heals
[2:11:49] because you know
[2:11:51] he
[2:11:53] he spoke the word and the Centurion
[2:11:55] servant was healed
[2:11:58] said I I don't need a touch just say it
[2:12:02] just send the word
[2:12:04] you know that's where his faith lay
[2:12:08] and if you're faithful lay that way you
[2:12:11] can be of service this morning while I'm
[2:12:14] preaching
[2:12:15] because when the gospel is preached
[2:12:18] demons are cast out
[2:12:23] amen
[2:12:24] now did you know brother Brandon said
[2:12:26] about Peter he received a special gift
[2:12:30] he said he received a great gift of
[2:12:33] healing so that people that laid in his
[2:12:37] shadow were healed
[2:12:39] so these people wasn't even touched all
[2:12:41] they had to do is just have his shadow
[2:12:43] pass over
[2:12:44] it was a great gift of healing
[2:12:48] but you said but shouldn't we be
[2:12:49] concerned about someone who's living
[2:12:52] with some kind of secret sin you know uh
[2:12:55] you know and and you know shouldn't you
[2:12:57] be afraid that would jump on you or
[2:13:00] you'd be associated with that well let's
[2:13:01] read the Bible
[2:13:03] the Bible answers it James 5 13.
[2:13:07] is any humongous Afflicted let him pray
[2:13:11] is any Mary let him sing Psalms
[2:13:14] is there any sick among you let him call
[2:13:17] for the Elders of the church let them
[2:13:19] pray over him anointing him with oil in
[2:13:22] the name of the Lord verse 15 and the
[2:13:25] prayer face shall save the sick
[2:13:27] and the Lord shall raise him up and
[2:13:32] doesn't matter we're eating this and if
[2:13:35] he hath committed sin
[2:13:38] is going to jump off on you
[2:13:43] you got to worry about getting his curse
[2:13:47] if he's committed sin they shall be
[2:13:50] forgiven him
[2:13:52] [Applause]
[2:13:54] well maybe he's done something and he
[2:13:56] committed sin and this came on him well
[2:13:58] if we pray for him
[2:14:00] God will not only in our intercession
[2:14:03] heal his body but forgive him of his
[2:14:05] sins
[2:14:11] thank you
[2:14:13] verse 15 says and the prayer of faith
[2:14:17] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[2:14:19] raise him up
[2:14:20] and if he committed sin they shall be
[2:14:22] forgiven and confess your false to one
[2:14:24] another pray for one another that you
[2:14:25] may be healed the effects of fervent
[2:14:28] prayer of a righteous man of aleth much
[2:14:31] now I want to tell you something
[2:14:34] in your intercession the first thing you
[2:14:37] have to do is position yourself
[2:14:39] as a righteous man
[2:14:44] you say well wait a minute when Jesus
[2:14:48] told us how to pray
[2:14:49] he told us first to position ourselves
[2:14:52] what do you say our father
[2:14:57] how can you how can you call him father
[2:14:59] and you're not a son you are positioned
[2:15:01] yourself in relation to him Our Father
[2:15:04] which art in heaven
[2:15:07] come on amen so the first thing you do
[2:15:10] when you pray is you position yourself
[2:15:13] as a son of God
[2:15:16] that's why people over here they're
[2:15:17] waiting on adoption in one day where you
[2:15:19] know when the bride gets the power we
[2:15:21] all get adopted glory to God well when's
[2:15:24] it going to be
[2:15:25] what are you gonna have to do to do it
[2:15:27] how much work do you have to do to get
[2:15:28] it
[2:15:29] I tell you what you receive the Holy
[2:15:31] Ghost he positions you in the body it
[2:15:33] gives you power to cast out Devils to
[2:15:35] speak with new times
[2:15:37] come on it's the adoption robe
[2:15:41] it's the badge of authority I will now
[2:15:44] after I'm now acting not as a hollow
[2:15:47] human being but as as a man filled with
[2:15:49] the spirit of God
[2:15:53] so the first thing you do is position
[2:15:55] yourself
[2:15:56] Who Am I who is God
[2:16:00] a distant God he's my father and he's my
[2:16:03] father I'm his son and as his son I can
[2:16:07] approach him
[2:16:08] I'm not a stranger I'm not a sinner I'm
[2:16:12] not a wayward one I'm a son and as a son
[2:16:15] I come into this presence with boldness
[2:16:21] amen now
[2:16:26] but brother Tim I'm not sinless
[2:16:30] I got lots of faults and sometimes
[2:16:33] like he preached about Sarah you know
[2:16:35] she struggles to believe and she doubts
[2:16:38] and quivers and waivers and
[2:16:41] I'm not going to ask you for a show of
[2:16:43] hands I'll just put mine up
[2:16:46] I have enough trouble with my own mind
[2:16:49] and my own unbelief my own doubting and
[2:16:52] quivering questioning you brother Tim
[2:16:55] yeah
[2:16:56] first thing I do when I come to God is I
[2:16:59] have to get rid of all of that
[2:17:01] because that ain't the truth
[2:17:03] I am a redeemed blood-bought son of the
[2:17:07] Living God
[2:17:08] bought by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:17:11] washed as white as snow without
[2:17:15] without one thing the devil has no claim
[2:17:19] of me
[2:17:21] because the blood has annihilated my sin
[2:17:27] so I'm not approved to the mentally
[2:17:30] sinner I'm approaching them as a son
[2:17:34] what about a son an osprey he's my daddy
[2:17:38] Papa God
[2:17:43] I can ask him a favor anytime I need
[2:17:46] this I need this this brother's need
[2:17:49] this brother's in need this sister God I
[2:17:52] need this
[2:17:57] my brother Brandon said a righteous man
[2:17:59] is not a sinless man oh now listen
[2:18:02] hold this notice he said Elijah was a
[2:18:05] man subject to passions as we are he had
[2:18:08] his ups and downs
[2:18:10] his differences
[2:18:12] and the scripture of his life proves he
[2:18:14] had his ups and downs like we do and he
[2:18:17] had times of wondering
[2:18:19] wondering questioning
[2:18:22] and his times that his temper got away
[2:18:24] from him
[2:18:29] he had a lot of things that went wrong
[2:18:32] but he was still a righteous man
[2:18:35] because he confesses unworthiness and
[2:18:37] believed in God and that's what made him
[2:18:39] righteous
[2:18:40] amen now come on now we are not
[2:18:43] righteous within ourselves we're
[2:18:45] righteous to Jesus Christ
[2:18:47] I cannot be Sanctified Within Myself I'm
[2:18:50] Sanctified through Jesus Christ who
[2:18:52] stands in the presence of God in my
[2:18:54] place it isn't my Holiness it's his
[2:18:57] Holiness my Holiness won't work at all
[2:18:59] but what he does because God has
[2:19:01] accepted him and accepted him he had to
[2:19:03] accept me because I'm in him
[2:19:05] hey that's pretty simple ain't you we
[2:19:08] are accepted in the Beloved if God
[2:19:10] accepts Christ he accepts me
[2:19:14] come on look in the Old Testament what
[2:19:16] was it bring a lamb without blemish
[2:19:19] and if the priest come on either you
[2:19:22] bring your lamb lead it up the priest
[2:19:25] never looked and said uh okay but you've
[2:19:29] got a flaw there you can't worship Boy
[2:19:33] you know you I'll tell you what you've
[2:19:36] made a mistake you you you can't come in
[2:19:38] here
[2:19:39] no no he never looked at the man
[2:19:42] he looked at the lab
[2:19:46] come on now
[2:19:48] and if the lamb was accepted and judge
[2:19:53] to be without blemish
[2:19:55] then he was accepted
[2:20:01] hallelujah how do I know I'm going to be
[2:20:04] if they accepted in the presence of God
[2:20:06] because they did everything right and I
[2:20:08] read my Bible on my knees for 24 hours
[2:20:10] at least this week and I prayed so long
[2:20:13] and I did this and I did this work and I
[2:20:15] carried Goods to this one and helped
[2:20:16] that is not how
[2:20:19] he's not looking at me
[2:20:22] he's looking at my lab
[2:20:26] and if Jesus was accepted
[2:20:30] you are accepted
[2:20:36] that's why the Bible said you are
[2:20:38] accepted at the Beloved
[2:20:47] where in Christ
[2:20:51] well you just don't know what kind of
[2:20:53] bad thoughts I had this week
[2:20:55] yeah you don't know what kind of bad
[2:20:58] thoughts I had
[2:21:00] and I ain't telling you either
[2:21:08] I'm going to tell you how many it was
[2:21:09] and what it was about
[2:21:11] ain't none of your business
[2:21:15] because every one of them thoughts I
[2:21:17] cast down
[2:21:19] they're not a part of me
[2:21:22] amen
[2:21:23] but you see that's why
[2:21:26] you see if your heart condemns you not
[2:21:28] then you can have confidence God hears
[2:21:30] you so how do we keep our hearts from
[2:21:32] condemning Us by repentance
[2:21:35] so we're not sinless in ourselves we
[2:21:38] can't be sanctifying ourselves we're
[2:21:39] Sanctified through Jesus Christ who
[2:21:41] stands in his presence in my place and
[2:21:43] isn't my Holiness is his Holiness my
[2:21:45] Holiness won't work at all but because
[2:21:48] God's son accepted him and accepted him
[2:21:50] he had to accept me because I'm in him
[2:21:51] was and that makes what makes it real
[2:21:54] isn't it then we don't depend on
[2:21:55] ourselves
[2:21:58] now let's get a little clarification
[2:22:00] now that doesn't make us say we can sin
[2:22:06] brother if you sin you're just away from
[2:22:09] God that's all there's only one thing is
[2:22:11] confessing it right with God as long as
[2:22:13] you desire to sin the desire of sin
[2:22:16] still in your heart then it's time to
[2:22:19] stay down to altar until that thing's
[2:22:21] taken out
[2:22:22] you will sin you're bound to sin because
[2:22:25] you can't help it but not willful sin
[2:22:29] he that sins willfully after receives
[2:22:32] the knowledge of Truth there remaineth
[2:22:34] no sacrifice for him you say well if I
[2:22:36] sin will believe then there's no
[2:22:37] sacrifice for me that's exactly right
[2:22:40] you have to go back to Calvary again
[2:22:44] that's all it means don't mean you're
[2:22:47] lost forever means you can either go
[2:22:49] back to Calvary
[2:22:50] because you need a sacrifice for that
[2:22:52] because you sin willfully but but every
[2:22:56] day he said you're beginning you're
[2:22:57] bound to sin so we'll think wrong
[2:22:59] thoughts we'll do we'll make a little
[2:23:01] mistakes along the way now we're not
[2:23:03] going to go out there and take another
[2:23:04] man's wife that's premeditated
[2:23:08] we're not going to go out there and lay
[2:23:10] with a that's premeditated
[2:23:13] you understand
[2:23:15] amen but you're you know willfully sin
[2:23:19] you know I
[2:23:20] you know you sin willfully after you
[2:23:22] receive the knowledge of the truth there
[2:23:24] remaineth no sacrifice for your sins but
[2:23:27] every every day you're bound to sin
[2:23:30] brother Brandon tells us if I got what I
[2:23:33] deserved I'd go to hell
[2:23:34] take the blood of Jesus off of you one
[2:23:37] minute you're lost
[2:23:40] you're hopeless when you're without God
[2:23:43] Bound for hell
[2:23:46] and let me just say even brother Brandon
[2:23:48] would pray many times the Lord forgive
[2:23:50] me of my sins I I really don't believe
[2:23:52] he was drinking and smoking and
[2:23:55] adulterizing and I
[2:23:58] but he fought with unbelief just like we
[2:24:01] do
[2:24:04] turn on the radio and the radio a man
[2:24:07] was saying something about God not being
[2:24:09] real and whatever and taking him down a
[2:24:11] path and he listens that a little bit
[2:24:13] and you know he got to thinking you know
[2:24:16] Satan began to talk to him and in his
[2:24:19] thoughts finally he got to hold himself
[2:24:21] and said Satan how a liar you are
[2:24:25] so while that ain't proper English I
[2:24:27] don't care what English it is devil
[2:24:29] understood it Satan how old are you all
[2:24:33] they make my thoughts dims your thoughts
[2:24:37] and you're going to go to hell for them
[2:24:39] thoughts but I ain't
[2:24:42] Hallelujah because there is an atomic
[2:24:46] at your house
[2:24:51] brother Branham talked about this
[2:24:53] affirmative prayer of a righteous man
[2:24:55] availeth much he said now we're not
[2:24:58] righteous no man is righteous only the
[2:25:00] Son of God and we don't stand in our own
[2:25:02] righteousness I don't stand in my
[2:25:04] righteousness I stand in his
[2:25:06] righteousness so as long as I'm Anointed
[2:25:08] with him it's the effectual fervent
[2:25:10] prayer of the righteous man interceding
[2:25:13] for you through me to have you believe
[2:25:16] now
[2:25:18] in the body of Christ
[2:25:20] there are Gifts of healing in the church
[2:25:23] as is one of the nine spiritual gifts
[2:25:27] and of course in there given by the
[2:25:30] spirit is the word of wisdom the word of
[2:25:32] knowledge
[2:25:34] faith is one of the gifts of the Spirit
[2:25:36] Well it gives her laid on the Shelf well
[2:25:38] then we can't have faith then
[2:25:40] you know to Gifts of healing and the
[2:25:43] Bible the Bible speaks gifts plural
[2:25:46] there to another that work in the
[2:25:48] Miracles to another prophecy to another
[2:25:50] discernment of the spirits to another
[2:25:52] diverse kinds of tongues to another the
[2:25:54] interpretation of tongues
[2:25:56] and brother Branham speaks of that in
[2:25:58] standing in the gap and he says
[2:26:01] he said in gifts the gifts has returned
[2:26:03] to the church's Divine Healing and
[2:26:05] prophecy and speak with tongues and
[2:26:07] interpretation and although it's been
[2:26:09] misrepresented terrifically yet but yet
[2:26:12] that don't take away there's a good one
[2:26:14] there is a true one of a real genuine a
[2:26:19] gift of speaking in tongues that's
[2:26:21] always supposed to be in the church
[2:26:24] so all the way down to the end and after
[2:26:28] the end
[2:26:29] because brother Branham tells us you
[2:26:32] know when we get on the other side we'll
[2:26:34] all be speaking in tongues
[2:26:36] a Heavenly language
[2:26:38] amen now so you see every man that's
[2:26:43] born of the spirit of God becomes the
[2:26:45] Son of God and the supernatural power of
[2:26:47] God is in him and he can't help but
[2:26:49] believe in the Supernatural because he's
[2:26:51] the son of God
[2:26:53] and there there's a lot of them today
[2:26:56] that you know it's cold and formal and
[2:26:59] different God forsaken backslidden
[2:27:01] churches because they're filled with
[2:27:04] men and women that are not born of the
[2:27:07] spirit of God they have no taste of God
[2:27:10] or they don't know nothing about him all
[2:27:11] they know is theology even if it's
[2:27:14] message Theology and that's the reason
[2:27:16] you can't get them to believe a thing
[2:27:20] but we're to be a spiritual church
[2:27:22] we're to be a super race we're a people
[2:27:25] that can that should hear his voice
[2:27:27] we're a people that should uh should it
[2:27:30] should become intercessors you know that
[2:27:33] that sigh and cry for the Abominations
[2:27:36] that's done in the city
[2:27:38] you know people that as brother random
[2:27:40] was said you know that sin is so sneaky
[2:27:43] it just sneaks right up on you before
[2:27:46] you know it and actually if you think
[2:27:48] about it you know you're living in a
[2:27:50] time and you know now it's quite common
[2:27:52] to you
[2:27:54] all the sin that's going on around you
[2:27:57] it just happens it's in your
[2:27:58] neighborhood it's in your schools it's
[2:28:00] everywhere
[2:28:01] and you see it it you know kind of makes
[2:28:04] you sick but it has a way of just kind
[2:28:06] of sneaking up on you where it becomes
[2:28:09] common well that's just the way things
[2:28:10] are but it should make you sigh and cry
[2:28:15] for the Abominations it's done in the
[2:28:17] city and brother Bradham said that's the
[2:28:19] one that God is putting his seal upon
[2:28:24] because otherwise it just dulls our
[2:28:26] senses oh well that's what's the world
[2:28:29] we live in
[2:28:30] and we get to the point that
[2:28:32] it doesn't bother us
[2:28:34] but it ought to make us sick
[2:28:37] and God wants intercessors he wants
[2:28:40] people who can pray the fervent prayer
[2:28:43] I'm gonna go just a little bit over time
[2:28:45] because I'm borrowing from next Sunday
[2:28:49] and then the next Sunday no it won't be
[2:28:51] that bad
[2:28:53] but I I want just a little more time
[2:28:56] now you know
[2:28:58] brother Madam was told by the angel you
[2:29:01] are to receive a gift to Divine Healing
[2:29:04] and he said how perfect that was they
[2:29:06] told you a gift he never said the gift
[2:29:11] but ever gift
[2:29:14] he said but Divine Healing is the gift
[2:29:18] but Divine Healing and it's a gift it's
[2:29:20] Gifts of healing
[2:29:22] and you can have all kinds of gifts of
[2:29:24] healing different ways but every other
[2:29:27] is a gift the gift of Prophecy the gift
[2:29:32] of this but Divine Healing is in the
[2:29:34] plural gifts
[2:29:36] and so there's not but what not just one
[2:29:40] gift of healing
[2:29:41] there is a variety of gifts of healing
[2:29:45] Peter had it where that his shadow would
[2:29:48] pass over and people it would be healed
[2:29:50] that was a great gift
[2:29:52] you know others you know while Paul was
[2:29:56] preaching he perceived that a man had
[2:29:58] Faith to be healed and commanded him to
[2:30:00] stand up
[2:30:01] you see again and again there's all
[2:30:04] kinds of others would be laid hands on
[2:30:06] different different approaches varieties
[2:30:08] or diversities the Bible calls it of
[2:30:11] gifts
[2:30:13] now brother Branham called it a gift a
[2:30:16] gift to preaching that could explain the
[2:30:19] word in such a way that you could
[2:30:22] receive your healing right there in your
[2:30:24] seat was also a gift of healing yet it
[2:30:27] was administered through preaching not
[2:30:30] laying on our hands
[2:30:32] so there's all kinds of ways that God
[2:30:34] will use it you know when when that and
[2:30:37] of course you know let me just say you
[2:30:39] think if the days of Miracles are passed
[2:30:41] brother Brandon said the days of God has
[2:30:43] passed
[2:30:44] so we know the days of God is in past
[2:30:47] so the days the Miracles are not passed
[2:30:50] so the only thing that we can do as a
[2:30:53] minister is to point you to the work at
[2:30:56] Calvary we have no power to heal you
[2:30:59] even though we have become the hands of
[2:31:01] Jesus there's no power in our hands
[2:31:03] we are just carrying out his word to lay
[2:31:07] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[2:31:09] just like getting ministering baptism
[2:31:11] water only saves you in the answering of
[2:31:14] a good conscience toward God not through
[2:31:16] the outward cleansing
[2:31:18] so it isn't a physical the physical act
[2:31:22] of baptism that saves you it is the the
[2:31:26] answer of a good conscience toward God
[2:31:27] but you have to do the physical act
[2:31:30] same thing with with laying on the hands
[2:31:32] it it doesn't heal you but it's a
[2:31:34] physical act through which God moves
[2:31:37] which he transfers his power through
[2:31:40] through uh through humans unto and as a
[2:31:44] as a
[2:31:45] um as a catalyst or a contact
[2:31:49] now brother Branham many times he didn't
[2:31:53] even raises his voice when he was
[2:31:56] praying for the sick many times it was
[2:31:58] very mellow very quiet
[2:32:01] you know many times that he he would
[2:32:05] pray for needs and even demon powers and
[2:32:08] just speak them you know I can go back
[2:32:12] to Youth Camp when when that boy there
[2:32:14] was laying there and I just
[2:32:16] in a voice she can only hardly hear and
[2:32:20] just spoke to him speak his peace
[2:32:24] till that demon there
[2:32:26] fled away
[2:32:29] and yet you could barely hear me say it
[2:32:32] there's other times I've lifted my voice
[2:32:36] listen
[2:32:38] I know
[2:32:39] I know the powers of demons but they got
[2:32:42] to fall before the presence of my God
[2:32:46] he commissioned me to cast out devils
[2:32:49] I know he's going to do it
[2:32:53] he commits me to lay hands on the sick
[2:32:55] and I know they're going to recover
[2:32:58] now but in a prayer line in 1948 brother
[2:33:02] Branham was praying for this woman and
[2:33:05] he must have lifted his raised his voice
[2:33:06] pretty loud he said doubt their Spirit
[2:33:08] come out of her in the name of of Jesus
[2:33:11] Christ the son of God leave the woman
[2:33:12] through Jesus Christ's name I assure you
[2:33:15] thee to go
[2:33:16] then he said I'm not yelling at you but
[2:33:20] you can't baby demons
[2:33:26] and faith is our Victory he says God
[2:33:29] rebuked that devil that's hindering you
[2:33:31] these beautiful little girls May the
[2:33:34] power that raised Jesus from the grave
[2:33:36] cast that thing away and never bother
[2:33:39] you no more I say that on the authority
[2:33:41] of God's word you have to get angry with
[2:33:43] the Devil
[2:33:47] amen God gives us a victory we got it
[2:33:49] right now this is the victory that
[2:33:51] overcomes the world even your faith but
[2:33:53] he says you have to get angry with the
[2:33:56] Devil
[2:33:57] so there are times brother Branham would
[2:33:59] be very soft
[2:34:01] there'd be other times he would scream
[2:34:04] out
[2:34:07] amen and there they would say you can't
[2:34:09] baby demons others you say scream out
[2:34:12] and he says you got to get angry with
[2:34:14] the Devil
[2:34:16] you see again it's diversities of gifts
[2:34:19] and diversities that of administration
[2:34:22] why am I saying that because God don't
[2:34:25] just have one way of doing things
[2:34:28] don't put him in a box
[2:34:31] and brother Brandon said most ministers
[2:34:33] who preached Divine Healing are usually
[2:34:35] all I ever met are great teachers of the
[2:34:37] word some of them just have great
[2:34:39] powerful Faith just lay hands on the
[2:34:41] people and scream out and make the enemy
[2:34:43] leave them now that's Faith that's the
[2:34:46] gift of faith
[2:34:48] so how could we deny that
[2:34:51] it's in the Bible
[2:34:54] now let me bring it down to you
[2:34:57] but it's not just preachers that have
[2:34:59] gifts of Faith or Gifts of healing
[2:35:02] that's in the body
[2:35:05] hello somebody I want to get it
[2:35:08] I want you to hear you're a partner too
[2:35:11] is not just preachers this is not a
[2:35:14] nicolaitan gospel
[2:35:17] where we conquer the laity and it's all
[2:35:19] in the preacher
[2:35:20] listen he says in the message
[2:35:22] expectations
[2:35:23] he said and here might be one tonight
[2:35:25] with the prayer of faith that would pray
[2:35:27] a prayer of faith that would heal
[2:35:29] someone that gift might be on them
[2:35:31] tonight and it might be upon this lady
[2:35:34] here tomorrow night
[2:35:39] and upon this man over here the next
[2:35:42] night and it might come back to her it's
[2:35:46] in the church the body
[2:35:50] so the gifts of healing are in the body
[2:35:55] hey now you say a sister or a gift of
[2:35:58] healing come on a sister well you
[2:36:00] remember Brother Brad I'm talking about
[2:36:02] it being in an auditorium there and he
[2:36:04] was going to have a a prayer line that
[2:36:07] night and prayer cards had been passed
[2:36:09] out and there was this little sister
[2:36:11] with a baby there that was afflicted and
[2:36:13] she was holding that baby and had a
[2:36:15] prayer card in her hand and and that
[2:36:17] sister sitting on the front row and
[2:36:19] she's saying you know uh you know man I
[2:36:24] just feel led to pray for that that baby
[2:36:26] and I just can't get away from it and so
[2:36:29] he kept kept kind of rebuking the
[2:36:32] thought really you know just putting it
[2:36:34] down putting it down and finally you
[2:36:36] know it just came over and she walked up
[2:36:39] to the sister and the little lady with
[2:36:41] the baby and said uh you know
[2:36:44] you would you mind if I said something
[2:36:47] to you and certainly well I'm a
[2:36:48] Christian too and I'm a mother and yeah
[2:36:50] just to relieve my conscience
[2:36:53] for the last 30 minutes you've been
[2:36:54] standing there I feel God wanted me to
[2:36:56] pray for that baby would you mind if I
[2:36:59] prayed for it before you took it up
[2:37:01] so well certainly she let the little
[2:37:03] baby out the mother prayed for it and
[2:37:06] said thank you and walked back and said
[2:37:08] why don't you take my seat and she gave
[2:37:10] her her seat and walked up into the
[2:37:12] balcony
[2:37:14] that night on the platform
[2:37:16] this lady come up in there with the baby
[2:37:18] and was told your babies had a certain
[2:37:21] certain disease yes said there's a woman
[2:37:23] that's dressed in a certain way prayed
[2:37:26] for that baby sitting right up there in
[2:37:28] that balcony there this that's screaming
[2:37:31] now and said she God ordained that that
[2:37:34] woman should pray for that baby
[2:37:39] again he said now what if that little
[2:37:41] mother had failed to do what God told
[2:37:43] her to do you know see it wasn't
[2:37:45] evangelist Place God works in all the
[2:37:47] laity we all have certain jobs to do but
[2:37:50] you pray for one another and God will
[2:37:52] take care of you in 1960 he mentions
[2:37:55] Again The Compassion of that mother for
[2:37:58] that baby would have been far beyond
[2:38:00] what I would have had for her so the
[2:38:02] gift of healing if God ever speaks to
[2:38:04] your heart to go pray for someone you go
[2:38:06] do what God tells you to do always
[2:38:09] follow the Holy Spirit
[2:38:12] again in question answer 64 he brings
[2:38:14] again can we all do Miracles he said yes
[2:38:17] when you're directed by the Holy Ghost
[2:38:19] to do Miracles go do it because the holy
[2:38:21] spirit's directed now he said if that
[2:38:23] woman wouldn't have carried out what God
[2:38:26] told her perhaps there would have been
[2:38:28] rebuking the spirit to her because she
[2:38:31] disobeyed God
[2:38:33] hello
[2:38:36] and she hadn't done what God told her to
[2:38:39] do
[2:38:40] perhaps there would have been a rebuke
[2:38:45] he said always if you're a Christian and
[2:38:47] something's persuading you to do
[2:38:49] something go do it don't doubt it go do
[2:38:53] it
[2:38:55] so you see
[2:38:57] the Bible talks about this
[2:38:59] and he talks about Elijah and he said
[2:39:01] Elijah was a man of like passion as we
[2:39:05] are
[2:39:06] and he prayed earnestly that it not
[2:39:08] rained you know he walks right out there
[2:39:10] and he said there will not be rain or
[2:39:12] due till I call for it but then he had
[2:39:14] to pray
[2:39:16] earnestly that it would rain
[2:39:20] here he spoke it in a word of faith and
[2:39:24] then had to pray
[2:39:25] God don't let it rain you know what I
[2:39:28] said
[2:39:29] and for three years it didn't rain and
[2:39:32] then God said he he God said to Elijah
[2:39:36] in the third year of drought said go to
[2:39:39] Ahab and tell him go show yourself to
[2:39:41] Ahab and I will send rain on the earth
[2:39:44] now God said I'm going to send rain
[2:39:46] so he goes up there there and and you
[2:39:50] know what happened here comes the pillar
[2:39:52] of fire down burns up the sacrifice the
[2:39:54] altar licks it up all around God
[2:39:57] vindicates him and he walks over to Ahab
[2:39:59] now it's not rained in three years
[2:40:01] the sky's the brass full of judgment
[2:40:06] and there ain't a hint of water in the
[2:40:08] sky they're in a cloud
[2:40:12] and and he just begins to act now
[2:40:15] because God said I'm going to send rain
[2:40:17] God said I'm going to heal you I'm the
[2:40:20] Lord God that heals All to Jesus you've
[2:40:22] got to act on it
[2:40:25] come on
[2:40:27] and the church has got to act on it if
[2:40:29] the church isn't praying and the church
[2:40:31] ain't believing in it and the church is
[2:40:34] forbidden it
[2:40:35] then God can't move
[2:40:37] [Applause]
[2:40:40] now so here Elijah there is saying they
[2:40:42] have guilty up and drink and he said for
[2:40:45] there is a sound of an abundance of rain
[2:40:48] he said I've already well listen where
[2:40:51] did he hear the sound when God said I'm
[2:40:53] going to send rain on the earth that was
[2:40:55] the sound of abundance of rain there is
[2:40:57] sound of healing
[2:41:00] that is right here in this building this
[2:41:02] morning because God said come on
[2:41:05] I'm gonna Shield you he'll not heal just
[2:41:08] your body he'll heal your marriages
[2:41:10] he'll heal your home he'll heal your
[2:41:13] finances he'll heal everything come on
[2:41:15] don't limit God
[2:41:20] limit the Holy One of Israel
[2:41:22] [Applause]
[2:41:27] so now God has said it's going to happen
[2:41:30] but Elijah's got to pray for it
[2:41:35] it is not going to happen till Elijah
[2:41:37] prays
[2:41:39] so Elijah gets up on the top of Mount
[2:41:42] Carmel
[2:41:43] cast himself down on Earth put his face
[2:41:46] between his knees
[2:41:51] and he said to his servant
[2:41:53] go now look to the Sea
[2:41:56] and he'd come back and said there's
[2:41:57] nothing
[2:41:59] so Elijah said
[2:42:01] God you ain't going to do it I prayed
[2:42:03] and it didn't happen
[2:42:06] so
[2:42:07] I give up let me just go tell Ahab
[2:42:11] no he didn't do that did he
[2:42:13] days of miracles must be passed
[2:42:16] there ain't no healing in the bride
[2:42:19] so what'd he do he went and prayed again
[2:42:22] and he prayed again he sent him again
[2:42:25] and he goes and said there's nothing
[2:42:29] so when you pray and you get nothing
[2:42:31] what do you do
[2:42:34] huh you pray again
[2:42:37] so what'd he do he prayed again and now
[2:42:39] the third time and nothing happens
[2:42:42] so he prays endlessly again come on
[2:42:46] amen the effects of fervent prayer of a
[2:42:50] righteous man when a man of God when a
[2:42:53] child of God will not give up but will
[2:42:55] be persevered and hold on and do like
[2:42:59] Abraham and go again and again and again
[2:43:02] and again
[2:43:05] but I prayed for that and nothing
[2:43:07] happened
[2:43:08] that's what was happening with Elijah I
[2:43:10] prayed nothing happened so you pray
[2:43:13] again nothing happens well go back up
[2:43:15] and look nothing
[2:43:17] Elijah might look up six times nothing
[2:43:20] seventh time he comes up there come on
[2:43:23] and before now everything has been like
[2:43:27] a failure
[2:43:29] prayed six times nothing happened
[2:43:34] might as well give up
[2:43:35] you're not a prophet off after all must
[2:43:38] be some sin in your life God ain't
[2:43:41] hearing you it might have been too
[2:43:42] haughty down there when you when you
[2:43:44] when you spoke to those prophets of Baal
[2:43:48] all this condemnation coming his way
[2:43:51] I'm talking about a man of Life passion
[2:43:53] as you you get down to pray and every
[2:43:55] time the accusers right there whispering
[2:43:58] saying all kinds of things and you have
[2:44:00] no right no whatever because he knows if
[2:44:04] you'll believe
[2:44:05] you're about to cast him down
[2:44:08] you see the Bible said that we were in
[2:44:12] the Heavenly it's a Heavenly battle
[2:44:14] against Princeton politics and powers
[2:44:16] and spiritual wickedness in Heavenly
[2:44:18] places
[2:44:20] so the higher you go in God the more
[2:44:22] you're going to be opposed by the devil
[2:44:25] so yes you as you begin to pray look for
[2:44:28] opposition
[2:44:31] come on it's a matter
[2:44:33] the devil's going to come out with all
[2:44:36] his forces with his accusation with
[2:44:38] everything but you don't give up
[2:44:40] I'm telling you don't give up on your
[2:44:42] marriage don't get up on your home don't
[2:44:45] give up on your children don't give up
[2:44:47] on the prodigal come on now I'm saying
[2:44:50] don't give up
[2:44:51] but I pray pray again
[2:44:59] the Bible said ask and keep on asking
[2:45:03] and it'll be given you
[2:45:05] seek and keep on seeking and you will
[2:45:07] find that now can you keep on knocking
[2:45:11] amen the door will be open
[2:45:14] for everyone who keeps on asking receive
[2:45:17] he that keeps on seeking fines he that
[2:45:19] keeps on knocking it shall be open
[2:45:23] Jesus told us a parable of an unjust
[2:45:26] judge
[2:45:28] and he told us about a woman that came
[2:45:30] she was a widow and wanted the judge to
[2:45:32] do something on her behalf and she he
[2:45:34] wouldn't do it he was a hard man and he
[2:45:37] didn't care for the Widow and whatever
[2:45:40] and she but he got to take him
[2:45:43] this woman is the kind of woman ain't
[2:45:45] gonna give up
[2:45:46] and so if I don't do something for her
[2:45:50] she will come in here every day
[2:45:54] troubling me
[2:45:55] are you with me amen so yet he said I
[2:45:59] don't feel man and I don't regard people
[2:46:03] I don't care whether she's a wit or not
[2:46:05] he's a hard man and he says but I'll
[2:46:08] tell you what she's persistent and I
[2:46:11] know if I don't give it to her she's
[2:46:13] going to come in here every day bothered
[2:46:15] me
[2:46:16] so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[2:46:17] give it to her
[2:46:19] now Jesus said hear what the unjust said
[2:46:22] God the unjust judge saith verse 7 of
[2:46:26] the of Luke 18 what's this put it up for
[2:46:30] me Luke
[2:46:32] 18 verse 7.
[2:46:34] and shall not God
[2:46:37] avenge his own elect
[2:46:40] which cry day and night unto him though
[2:46:45] he bear along with him what's not verse
[2:46:48] 8 I tell you this is Jesus word he will
[2:46:51] events them speedily nevertheless when
[2:46:54] the son of man cometh will he find
[2:46:57] people who won't give up
[2:47:00] will he find people that'll hold on to
[2:47:03] the promise will I find that kind of
[2:47:05] Faith persistent faith on the Earth
[2:47:09] are you with me now
[2:47:11] now then the Bible said about Elijah
[2:47:15] and it came to pass the seventh time
[2:47:21] that he came and said behold
[2:47:25] out of the sea
[2:47:27] Rose this little Cloud it's not like a
[2:47:30] man's hand it's not very big
[2:47:34] now listen
[2:47:36] all Elijah had to do was just see the
[2:47:40] slightest movement
[2:47:42] he didn't think God that's good enough
[2:47:44] you're going to do I tell you you'll
[2:47:46] never get enough water out of that
[2:47:48] so what a mouse
[2:47:51] no I think what he did
[2:47:54] he looked at that and he said us I see
[2:47:57] it right there in that promise I see God
[2:47:59] moving I see the spirit moving I see a
[2:48:02] cloud I see something happening and he
[2:48:05] began to act of what had happened and he
[2:48:07] said go tell Ahab and prepare your
[2:48:09] Terrier because I can hear the sound of
[2:48:13] abundance of rain I see the holy spirit
[2:48:15] is about to break out
[2:48:18] Hallelujah that's what we're seeing the
[2:48:21] size about his head we have seen this
[2:48:23] healing this miracle this tonight and
[2:48:26] the other don't you give up on any
[2:48:28] promise of God look at the promise of
[2:48:30] God and say that promise is mine I've
[2:48:33] not given up on it I'm going to have it
[2:48:35] for my children I'm gonna have it for my
[2:48:37] family if I have it for my marriage I'm
[2:48:40] gonna happen for my church
[2:48:46] thank you Jesus
[2:48:48] that's why we ought to look at it this
[2:48:50] morning thank you Jesus I see things
[2:48:52] beginning to move I see the holy ghost
[2:48:55] look at that
[2:48:59] now I'm going to act on it let the
[2:49:01] musicians come
[2:49:03] Hallelujah
[2:49:07] get in desperation
[2:49:09] go there and keep on praying
[2:49:12] approach him again I've asked you for
[2:49:15] 15. what about 45 I've asked you for 45.
[2:49:19] what about 40. I've asked you for 40.
[2:49:22] what about 30. I'm asking for 30. what
[2:49:25] about 20. what about what about 10
[2:49:27] whatever
[2:49:30] and the Bible said and God remembered
[2:49:34] Abraham
[2:49:36] and saved lot
[2:49:40] there's about there's some here this
[2:49:42] morning God's remembering
[2:49:44] he hasn't forgot you
[2:49:47] he wants to work through you
[2:49:49] amen he wants to work through you are
[2:49:52] you with me
[2:49:54] my think of that just a moment
[2:49:58] brother Branham talks about it and the
[2:50:00] Bible says
[2:50:01] and let me just cover this just a moment
[2:50:03] I know you're standing now and we're
[2:50:06] here at the end
[2:50:08] but I want just to I just want to bring
[2:50:09] this out
[2:50:11] the Bible said that sometimes we don't
[2:50:14] even know what to pray for put up Romans
[2:50:16] 8 26.
[2:50:18] and says the Holy Spirit helps us in our
[2:50:22] infirmities for we don't know what to
[2:50:24] pray for
[2:50:25] Israel
[2:50:27] but the spirit itself make its
[2:50:29] intercession for us with groanings which
[2:50:32] cannot be uttered
[2:50:33] and he that searches the heart knoweth
[2:50:35] what is the mind of God because he
[2:50:38] maketh intercession for the Saints
[2:50:41] according to the will of God
[2:50:43] so when you pray
[2:50:45] you might be like the little boy who was
[2:50:48] saying his alphabet
[2:50:50] and he was down praying and somebody
[2:50:52] come up to him and said Sonny Boy what
[2:50:54] are you doing say in your alphabet
[2:50:55] that's disrespectful he said no
[2:50:58] I don't mean to be disrespectful
[2:51:01] he said you see
[2:51:02] I I was I I have no education I wasn't
[2:51:06] I'm an orphan I didn't get to go to
[2:51:08] school and I don't know how to read or
[2:51:10] write
[2:51:11] but I do know the alphabet
[2:51:13] and my mama died before she could teach
[2:51:15] me how to pray and I don't even know how
[2:51:17] to pray
[2:51:18] so I was down here just reciting my
[2:51:21] alphabet
[2:51:22] he said because I knew God could take
[2:51:25] those letters
[2:51:26] inform them into words that he would
[2:51:29] know my heart and what I'm trying to say
[2:51:34] the Holy Spirit
[2:51:36] oh my do you break out sometimes into an
[2:51:40] unknown language to you
[2:51:42] brother Brandon was in a meeting
[2:51:47] and he had a strange event
[2:51:50] he felt so burdened he couldn't go to
[2:51:53] the church
[2:51:54] and he was going to let the meeting just
[2:51:57] go on without appearing
[2:51:59] he's in a hotel and Billy came and said
[2:52:01] dad you ready no I can't go come back in
[2:52:04] dab you ready you know I feel so burden
[2:52:06] I can't go
[2:52:09] and he says okay I'll be back around say
[2:52:13] go tell brother Baxter
[2:52:15] just to do what he can with the meeting
[2:52:17] close it however he wants to I can't
[2:52:20] come
[2:52:21] he said about that time as Billy walked
[2:52:24] off to get a Coke and a candy bar
[2:52:27] he
[2:52:29] was there and he began to hear somebody
[2:52:31] in German sound like he thought it was
[2:52:33] German
[2:52:35] began to speak he said who is that
[2:52:39] ah they're really desperate whatever
[2:52:40] they is there's something going on and
[2:52:43] you know he could hear the noise from
[2:52:44] down the street in his hotel and and
[2:52:47] this man over here speaking in German so
[2:52:50] what is that
[2:52:51] said has he listened he realized it
[2:52:54] wasn't out in the hall it was right
[2:52:56] there in a room and he felt of his mouth
[2:52:58] and it was his mouth moving
[2:53:00] and he was speaking in another language
[2:53:03] foreign
[2:53:09] like I could just run through a trip and
[2:53:12] leap over a wall
[2:53:14] I felt such freedom and he said I ran
[2:53:17] and found Billy said Billy don't leave
[2:53:18] without me let's go and got the meeting
[2:53:20] brother Baxter was singing a song One
[2:53:23] More Time waiting and saying well I Bill
[2:53:24] said I thought you'd never get here
[2:53:26] brother Bradham uh you know uh you know
[2:53:29] you're late I know I know and he gets
[2:53:31] something goes to speak
[2:53:34] and in the back
[2:53:35] there's a woman who was dying had been
[2:53:39] dying with tuberculosis
[2:53:41] doctor said don't move her her lungs
[2:53:43] will rupture
[2:53:45] they took an old car and took the seed
[2:53:47] out of it laid her down in the rough
[2:53:50] roads I think it was in Arkansas
[2:53:52] the rough roads could have been
[2:53:54] Louisiana's rough roads
[2:53:56] the man who began to beat her up and
[2:53:58] down and you know her lungs ruptured and
[2:54:02] blood was spurting out of her mouth and
[2:54:03] she said get me out of here I don't want
[2:54:06] to die in this car and they laid her out
[2:54:08] on the grass
[2:54:09] and all of a sudden laying out there in
[2:54:13] a dying condition about to draw our last
[2:54:15] breath
[2:54:16] something came over her and she jumped
[2:54:19] up from there totally healed ran to the
[2:54:21] meeting was shouting in the back and
[2:54:23] they said what was it
[2:54:25] said I was on the way to the meeting and
[2:54:27] there I was dying blood coming out of my
[2:54:30] mouth I was hemored into death
[2:54:33] and said all of a sudden I was healed
[2:54:34] and said what time was that brother
[2:54:36] Bradham Mass what time was it was
[2:54:38] exactly the same time he was interceding
[2:54:41] through a prophet on Earth he said it
[2:54:44] might have been her angel that came to
[2:54:46] him but whether it came to him and he
[2:54:48] began to speak to him through him and
[2:54:50] intercede God wants to use his people
[2:54:54] God wants to use you
[2:54:57] Amen to intercede on the behalf of
[2:54:59] others
[2:55:01] I wonder how many he's got a burden in
[2:55:03] your heart this morning
[2:55:04] you got a need that is there maybe some
[2:55:07] need
[2:55:08] some desire maybe lost loved one maybe
[2:55:11] maybe a a a
[2:55:13] your home is all tore up maybe maybe
[2:55:17] sicknesses in your body maybe you got a
[2:55:20] friend maybe whatever
[2:55:22] maybe he got someone that's lost
[2:55:25] maybe right here in this building this
[2:55:27] morning that needs a touch
[2:55:30] let's practice what we've heard today
[2:55:35] I want you to lay your hands on that
[2:55:37] person next to you right now
[2:55:42] I want you to agree together
[2:55:46] I don't know
[2:55:48] maybe you can have compassion for that
[2:55:50] brother that sister
[2:55:53] won this right now
[2:55:56] in need
[2:55:58] you can have compassion
[2:56:01] so that's my brother
[2:56:03] that's my little sister that's my friend
[2:56:08] they got a need in their life
[2:56:12] and we've been commissioned to lay hands
[2:56:14] on the sick and they shall recover
[2:56:17] as sickness may be a home disease
[2:56:21] marriage problem
[2:56:22] that sickness could be financial
[2:56:25] situation
[2:56:26] [Music]
[2:56:27] might be a demon
[2:56:29] [Music]
[2:56:30] of Oppression or depression a spirit of
[2:56:33] suicide
[2:56:35] it could be a spirit of the enemy
[2:56:37] whatever it is
[2:56:38] subject to the name of Jesus Christ
[2:56:43] we've had on the board all day here
[2:56:46] Moses with his hands lifted up
[2:56:51] interceding and of course as he
[2:56:53] interceded
[2:56:54] for Israel in the battle
[2:56:56] when his hands fall down
[2:56:59] the battle would go against him
[2:57:02] and they would be run from their enemies
[2:57:06] but I'm asking today is there somebody
[2:57:09] here
