[44:46] not yet born neither having done any
[44:49] good or evil that the purpose of God
[44:52] according to election might stand not of
[44:55] works but of him that calleth. It was
[44:58] said unto her, "The elder shall serve
[45:00] the younger, as it is written, Jacob
[45:04] have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
[45:08] Amen. We let you be
[45:11] seated. I just speak to you on faith and
[45:15] your calling and
[45:17] election. Amen. How many is glad to be
[45:19] called by God?
[45:21] Amen. To be loved by him. You know uh
[45:26] we want to also read Romans chap 11 and
[45:29] verse
[45:31] 29. For the gifts and calling of God are
[45:35] without
[45:37] repentance. We want to read that in the
[45:39] amplified says for the gifts and the
[45:42] calling of God are
[45:45] irrevocable. They're
[45:47] irrevocable. For he does not withdraw
[45:50] what he is given, nor does he change his
[45:54] mind about to those to whom his grace he
[45:57] gives his grace or to whom he sends his
[46:00] call. How many's thankful for that?
[46:02] Maybe maybe I'll just read that again.
[46:04] Amen. For his for the gifts and the
[46:06] callings of God are irrevocable.
[46:10] For he does not withdraw what he has
[46:12] given, nor does he change his mind about
[46:15] those to whom he gives his grace to or
[46:18] to whom he sends his call. Amen. I'm
[46:22] thankful for that. I'm thankful that he
[46:25] doesn't change his mind about me. But
[46:27] amen, if he saw me in his mind before
[46:29] the foundation of the world, and I
[46:31] believe that with all my heart, that
[46:33] amen, he doesn't come, you know, and see
[46:36] me in mistakes or see me in failures.
[46:38] But in spite of all of that, amen, his
[46:41] love has been granted to me and to you.
[46:43] Amen. Amen. Second Peter would would
[46:46] also say, he says in first second Peter
[46:48] 1:10, it says, "Wherefore the rather,
[46:51] brethren, give diligence to make your
[46:54] calling and election sure. For if you do
[46:57] these things, you shall never fail or
[46:59] never fall." See, but I I want you to
[47:02] understand, it isn't us making ourselves
[47:05] anything. That's not what he's talking
[47:07] about. He's not talking about us us
[47:09] making sure that we're called or us
[47:12] making sure uh uh uh that that we have
[47:14] that we're in the right place. Sure, you
[47:16] do seek after those things as far as
[47:19] repentance and those things in your
[47:20] life, but ultimately the call that's
[47:23] been placed in your life is because God
[47:25] called you. Amen. It is a gift that was
[47:28] placed in you before the world began.
[47:31] Amen. You know, this is what Paul would
[47:33] say. Paul would say, "I'm an apostle of
[47:35] Jesus Christ by the will of God."
[47:38] Because if it was his will, he would
[47:40] have done other things. And he was on
[47:42] his way to do other things. And they
[47:44] wasn't good things. It was, Amen. going
[47:46] to persecute the church of the living
[47:48] God. But, Amen. God in his grace stepped
[47:51] in Paul's way and changed him. Amen. To
[47:53] where he no longer was according to what
[47:56] the will of Paul was, but I'm now an
[47:58] apostle by the will of God. You know,
[48:00] brother Brandon would say it like this,
[48:02] you know, because he says, he said, "A
[48:04] son of God can go a long time before he
[48:07] recognizes he's his son." I'm thankful
[48:09] for that right there because that gives
[48:11] me grace. Amen. It was a long time
[48:13] before I realized it. Maybe it's a long
[48:15] time for some of you till you realize,
[48:17] hey, I I'm not I'm not a I'm not I don't
[48:20] belong to the devil. I I don't belong to
[48:22] what he has or what he's purposed for my
[48:25] life. That's not who I am. I am a son of
[48:28] God. Amen. I was made for more. I I
[48:31] wasn't born to be tending a grave or or
[48:33] or tending things of the past or or or
[48:36] living in the past. I was made for more.
[48:38] I I was made to be a son or daughter of
[48:41] God. Sometimes it takes years and years
[48:43] and years for a man or a woman to
[48:46] realize that. But when they can realize,
[48:48] amen, that God placed that in them
[48:50] before the foundation of the world.
[48:52] That's why when they come down to that
[48:54] moment and they feel that pull, amen, it
[48:56] was there all the time. They just pushed
[48:58] it away. Maybe they didn't heed it.
[49:00] Maybe they didn't. They just kind of
[49:02] pushed it into the back somewhere. But
[49:04] God put that there before they had ever
[49:07] sinned. Before they had ever done wrong,
[49:09] before they had ever made one mistake,
[49:12] God placed the sea gene on the inside of
[49:14] them. And at the right time, in the
[49:17] right moment, it was going to come to
[49:19] pass. Amen. But listen, I don't care how
[49:21] long it takes, they will come.
[49:25] Amen. They will come. This is what he
[49:27] said in John 6 and verse 37 and 44. All
[49:31] that the father giveth me shall come to
[49:35] me. I I don't see no negotiation there.
[49:38] Amen. If you are if you are belong to
[49:40] God, Amen. you will come. There ain't
[49:42] enough devils. There ain't enough hell.
[49:45] There ain't enough sin. There ain't
[49:46] enough sorrow. There ain't enough
[49:48] mistakes. There ain't enough drugs.
[49:50] There ain't enough ain't enough things
[49:51] of this world. Amen. to keep you from
[49:54] coming. If you are a seed gene of God,
[49:57] you shall come. Amen. There ain't enough
[50:00] devils in hell that can keep it from
[50:02] happening. Every one of us had demons
[50:04] that were assigned to our life. And they
[50:06] were tried there to keep us from
[50:08] realizing our true potential, to keep us
[50:11] from realizing who we truly are. Amen.
[50:13] But there was something that was more
[50:15] powerful that was placed inside of you
[50:18] before the world began. It was that seed
[50:21] of God. And there was that fierce force
[50:23] of life that came out of you and it
[50:26] pushed back through hell and it pushed
[50:28] back through demons. Amen. That you can
[50:30] be a son of God. Amen. And he said, "And
[50:33] him that cometh to me, I shall know why
[50:35] it's cast out. No man can come to me
[50:38] except the father draw him." Amen.
[50:41] There's a key right there. It wasn't you
[50:44] looking for God. It was God drawing you.
[50:47] Amen. And I will raise him up in the
[50:50] last day. Amen. In John 1 and verse 12,
[50:52] it says, "But as many as received him,
[50:55] to him gave him power, he power to
[50:57] become the sons of God, even to them
[50:59] that believe on his name, which were
[51:01] born, not of blood, nor of the will of
[51:04] the flesh, nor of the will of mind, but
[51:07] of God." Amen. But of God. Amen. That's
[51:11] why we we we brother stated it. Amen. We
[51:14] have stated it. Amen. God doesn't have
[51:16] grandchildren.
[51:18] This is not something that's passed down
[51:20] through a blood a human blood lineage.
[51:23] Amen. From one father to a son. Amen.
[51:26] It's passed down. Amen. By the will of
[51:28] God. That God saw you in his mind before
[51:32] the foundation of the world. Amen. When
[51:34] did God choose you? He didn't choose you
[51:36] at an altar.
[51:38] He didn't choose you five minutes ago or
[51:41] or or 10 years ago or whenever it was.
[51:44] But he said according as he has chosen
[51:46] us in him before the foundation of the
[51:49] world. Amen. We're making our calling
[51:51] and election sure. It's not my calling.
[51:54] It's his calling. It's not my election.
[51:57] It's his election.
[51:59] And God put it in my heart.
[52:02] Amen. before the foundation of the world
[52:05] that we should be holy and without blame
[52:08] before him in love, having predestinated
[52:11] us unto the adoption of children by
[52:13] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[52:15] good pleasure of his will. See, Jesus is
[52:18] choosing himself a bride.
[52:21] He's choosing himself a people. Amen.
[52:24] Amen. Just the same as a man chooses
[52:26] their bride today. You know, it ain't it
[52:28] shouldn't be that the bride is out
[52:30] looking for the man.
[52:33] Oh, come on, somebody. And it shouldn't
[52:35] be that the bride is out looking for the
[52:37] man, but the man is looking for the
[52:39] bride.
[52:42] Hallelujah. Amen. The man is looking for
[52:44] the bride. The bride today is not, you
[52:47] know, just simply decide, I'm going to
[52:48] marry this one or I'm going to do this.
[52:50] It's a groom who decides and chooses a
[52:53] certain woman to be his bride. Amen.
[52:55] It's what he said in John 15 and verse
[52:57] 16. You have not chosen me, but I have
[53:01] chosen you.
[53:04] Won't you stuff that in the devil's pipe
[53:06] and let him smoke it for a little while?
[53:07] Amen. I didn't choose this. God chose
[53:10] me.
[53:12] Amen. God placed me here. God put me in
[53:15] this position. Some of you young people
[53:17] need to look at that devil right in the
[53:19] eye and say, "God chose me to be a young
[53:22] person in the Leodysian church age to
[53:24] overcome you.
[53:27] God chose me. God placed me. God put me
[53:31] here. And there ain't nothing the devil
[53:32] can do about it.
[53:36] Said according to the word of God, the
[53:37] bride was a chosen before the foundation
[53:40] of the world. The chosen of the bride
[53:43] was purposed in himself. Amen. In Romans
[53:46] 9:11, the purpose of God according to
[53:49] election might stand. According to
[53:51] election might stand. You can't read it
[53:53] any way. The heart purpose, the eternal
[53:56] purpose of God was to take a bride of
[53:58] his own choosing.
[54:01] Amen. That and that purpose was in
[54:03] himself. And being eternal was decreed
[54:06] before the foundation of the world. This
[54:08] is why, Amen. This is why it's important
[54:10] to see this because many times we think,
[54:12] well, the devil's chose me or I was
[54:14] chosen of the devil. Listen, before the
[54:16] devil was ever created, God chose you.
[54:19] Before the devil ever existed, God chose
[54:23] you. So before the devil and all that he
[54:26] has, his anxiety, fear, depression, sin,
[54:29] before all that had ever come upon this
[54:31] earth, God had already put his mark upon
[54:34] you and said, "That one's mine. That
[54:36] one's mine. That one's mine. That one's
[54:38] mine." Amen.
[54:40] So before the devil could ever come and
[54:42] put drugs or sin or any kind of thing,
[54:45] alcohol, sexual things, whatever it was,
[54:48] God had already chose you.
[54:54] So before there was ever a speck of
[54:58] stardust, before God was
[55:01] God, ah man, that's taking it way back.
[55:05] God is an object of adoration and no one
[55:07] was there to worship him. So before he
[55:09] was even God,
[55:11] he was only known as an eternal spirit,
[55:14] but you was already in his mind.
[55:18] Hallelujah. Ain't it wonderful sometimes
[55:21] to get a card in the mail to know, Amen,
[55:23] that I that somebody's thinking of you.
[55:26] Amen. I believe that's what tonight's
[55:28] all about. Something coming in the mail
[55:31] tonight to let you know somebody's
[55:32] thought of you.
[55:34] Maybe the president ain't thought of you
[55:36] or anybody else around you hadn't
[55:37] thought of you in a long time and you
[55:39] feel so all forgotten and somewhere else
[55:42] and nobody's seen you or nobody's
[55:44] noticed. Amen. But God seen you. God
[55:47] chose you. Amen. Before the foundation
[55:49] of the world, before there was ever a
[55:51] speck of stardust. Amen. He was only
[55:53] known as the eternal spirit. You was
[55:56] already his mind. Yeah, you were. She
[55:58] You was existing in his thoughts.
[56:02] What about those thoughts of God? God.
[56:03] Are they not eternal?
[56:05] Amen. The eternal thoughts of God. He
[56:07] said, "Let me ask you, are the thoughts
[56:09] of God eternal?"
[56:12] Said, "If you can see this, you will see
[56:13] many things. God is unchangeable in both
[56:16] essence and behavior." We've studied
[56:18] that and proved it already. God is
[56:20] infinite in his ability. So therefore,
[56:22] God must be omnisent. If he isn't
[56:24] omnisent, then he's not he's not he's
[56:26] not now learning, nor is he he taking
[56:28] counsel even himself. Nor is he any time
[56:31] adding knowledge to his or adding to his
[56:33] knowledge. If he can add to his
[56:35] knowledge, he's not omnisent. Amen. The
[56:37] best we could say is sometimes he will
[56:40] be, but that's not scriptural.
[56:43] He is omnisient. He has never had a new
[56:46] thought about anything because all of
[56:49] his thoughts he's always had and he
[56:51] always will have. And he knows the end
[56:54] from the beginning because he is God.
[56:59] Hallelujah. So therefore, if he had this
[57:02] thought of you before the foundation of
[57:04] the world, he had a thought of you when
[57:06] you was in perfection. He had a thought
[57:08] of you before you ever sinned. Before
[57:10] you ever done one thing wrong, before
[57:13] you came into this world speaking lies,
[57:15] he had a thought of you and that thought
[57:17] has not changed.
[57:21] Come on. He doesn't look at you all down
[57:23] and defeated and tore up. No, he still
[57:26] has that thought in his mind.
[57:29] I see her as an overcomer. I see her
[57:32] triumphant. I see her whooping devils. I
[57:35] see her. Amen. Rising above every sin.
[57:38] That's how I see her.
[57:40] I see her in perfection. I see her that
[57:43] God has seen you in his mind and that
[57:46] has never changed.
[57:49] So in other words, anything that happens
[57:50] here on the earth does not change God's
[57:53] thought of you,
[57:57] right?
[57:58] Job found that
[58:00] out. Job was in terrible place one time
[58:04] and he was all tore up and defeated and
[58:07] been through a
[58:08] lot. You know, maybe he just come out of
[58:10] a camp service and just had a wonderful
[58:12] time and all of a sudden lost
[58:15] everything. His wife's turning against
[58:17] him all kind. He's sitting on ash sheet
[58:20] with balls
[58:22] and God's come down to speak to him. He
[58:24] says, "Joe, I want you to gird yourself
[58:27] for a little bit. I want to speak to you
[58:28] like a
[58:30] man. I want you to not just look at five
[58:33] minutes ago or 10 years ago or a hundred
[58:36] years ago. I want you to go back before
[58:39] the world ever began. Where was God
[58:41] taking him?" God wasn't taking him to
[58:44] where the last time he sacrificed or the
[58:46] last time he had a good time in church
[58:48] or or the last time he had an outbreak
[58:50] in the Holy Ghost.
[58:53] Come on. He wasn't taking him back to
[58:56] just those moments. Amen. He was taking
[58:58] him back, Amen. all the way to the mind
[59:01] of God. And he said, Job, let me ask
[59:03] you, where were you when the sons of God
[59:06] shouted for joy? Where were you when the
[59:08] morning stars sank together and they saw
[59:10] the plan of redemption? and they saw all
[59:12] this take place. Where were you?
[59:16] You were in my mind.
[59:18] Amen. You were there rejoicing with
[59:21] them.
[59:26] He's never had a new thought about
[59:29] anything.
[59:30] Thus, the thoughts of God are eternal.
[59:34] They are real.
[59:36] They're not just simply like a man with
[59:38] a blueprint has drawn up which one day
[59:41] will be
[59:42] translated into substance and form, but
[59:46] they're already real and eternal and
[59:48] part of God. So in other words, to God
[59:51] it's done.
[59:55] You know, with us here at this church,
[59:57] we had to have a blueprint. And we
[59:58] looked at that blueprint for maybe a
[1:00:00] year or whatever and we thought about
[1:00:02] this. and we moved this over here and we
[1:00:03] we done this over here and we thought no
[1:00:05] that wall would be better over there and
[1:00:06] we want to look like this and we want
[1:00:08] that and in the middle of the building
[1:00:09] we doing this and doing that. That ain't
[1:00:11] the way God operates.
[1:00:13] God does not he's already saw it already
[1:00:16] finished.
[1:00:18] Amen. He already seen it done. Amen.
[1:00:20] This is why he could say in Romans 8 29
[1:00:24] for those whom he forneew
[1:00:27] read the amplified before the for those
[1:00:29] whom he forneew and loved and chose
[1:00:33] beforehand.
[1:00:36] Hallelujah. He is also predestinated to
[1:00:39] be conformed into the image of his son
[1:00:42] and ultimately share in his complete
[1:00:44] sanctification. So that when he would be
[1:00:46] the firstborn, the most beloved and
[1:00:48] honored among many believers and those
[1:00:50] he has predestinated, he has called. And
[1:00:53] those he has called, he is also
[1:00:55] justified, decreed, I mean declared free
[1:00:59] from the guilt of sin. And those he
[1:01:01] justified, he is also glorified.
[1:01:06] It's already done in God's mind.
[1:01:13] But see, you know, when Abraham, it was
[1:01:15] Abraham, you know, doubt maybe was a
[1:01:17] good man, but it wasn't because he was a
[1:01:19] good man that God elected him. God chose
[1:01:23] him. It wasn't Abraham ever choosing
[1:01:26] God. It was God choosing
[1:01:29] Abraham. It isn't you ever choosing God.
[1:01:35] is God chose you.
[1:01:38] Amen. Now this he says may be strong. He
[1:01:40] said but I want you to notice
[1:01:41] immediately after the choice election it
[1:01:44] separates from everything else. As soon
[1:01:46] as he calls he elects and when he calls
[1:01:49] he separates you from everything that
[1:01:51] hangs on to you.
[1:01:54] Come on now. Amen. If God has truly
[1:01:56] called you, he's going to separate you
[1:01:59] from those things that try to hang on to
[1:02:01] you.
[1:02:04] If it's truly a work of God and God has
[1:02:07] come down and put his mark upon your
[1:02:10] life, he's going to separate you. That's
[1:02:12] right. He going to separate you from a
[1:02:15] lot of friends that used to hold you
[1:02:16] down. He going to separate you from a
[1:02:18] lot of things that would would hold you
[1:02:20] back and in times before. Why? Because
[1:02:23] God calls you. He's going to separate
[1:02:24] you.
[1:02:27] Going to cut it
[1:02:29] off. He said, because you know with
[1:02:32] Abraham, you know, Abraham took his
[1:02:34] father-in-law and he took his nephew and
[1:02:36] and all that was fine for a moment, but
[1:02:38] it caused a lot of problems and and it
[1:02:40] caused him to have issues. He said, but
[1:02:42] see, he said, he said, it isn't a two or
[1:02:45] three people together thing. He expects
[1:02:48] every individual an individual affair
[1:02:51] with every person.
[1:02:54] This is what God desires. It isn't
[1:02:57] because your mother is saved, therefore
[1:02:59] you're saved.
[1:03:01] It isn't because you go to this church
[1:03:03] that you're saved or you go to all the
[1:03:06] camps that you're saved or you go to any
[1:03:09] church that you're saved. Amen. I
[1:03:11] believe you will go to church if you're
[1:03:13] saved. Don't get me wrong. Amen. But
[1:03:15] that's not why you're saved. It's
[1:03:17] because God chose you in Christ.
[1:03:21] That's why you're saved.
[1:03:24] It isn't because you don't make
[1:03:25] mistakes. It isn't because you pray five
[1:03:27] times a day. It isn't because you laid
[1:03:30] everything away and you walk just as
[1:03:32] virtuous as you can walk and you've done
[1:03:34] everything you can do and it's all
[1:03:36] works. That's not what this is about. It
[1:03:39] isn't because of all that you're saved.
[1:03:41] You're saved because God chose you.
[1:03:45] And if God chose you, he can't uncheoose
[1:03:48] you.
[1:03:50] Hallelujah. Amen. That's what the devil
[1:03:52] wants to work you people over a lot
[1:03:54] because you make a mistake and you make
[1:03:56] some failures or or you do something
[1:03:58] wrong. Listen, it's just get back up
[1:04:00] again cuz God chose me. Therefore, if I
[1:04:03] make a mistake, he won't unchoose me. He
[1:04:06] won't throw me to the wayside, but he'll
[1:04:08] pick that clay up and he'll begin to
[1:04:10] mold it all over
[1:04:12] [Applause]
[1:04:16] again. Not you choosing yourself, not
[1:04:19] your choice. That's what he said. How
[1:04:21] much you prayed, how much you turned
[1:04:23] over a new page, you had nothing to do
[1:04:26] with it. It's
[1:04:27] God. Oh my. When you see, get to see
[1:04:30] that that truth. You mean that I didn't
[1:04:33] turn to the Lord? No sir. You had no way
[1:04:36] of all of turning to the Lord. Your
[1:04:38] whole nature, your whole makeup was
[1:04:40] against God. But God called you.
[1:04:46] In the garden of Eden when man sin first
[1:04:48] looked first look at the nature of of a
[1:04:50] sinner he was
[1:04:52] hiding hiding back and when the presence
[1:04:55] of God came down in the garden what did
[1:04:57] he do he went and hid tried to make his
[1:04:59] own way try to do his own thing he
[1:05:03] didn't come out and confess it make it
[1:05:05] right he then when he was confronted
[1:05:07] with it he he blamed somebody else
[1:05:11] come on now there's a lot of people good
[1:05:14] at that. Amen. They're confronted with
[1:05:17] so with an issue in their life. Well,
[1:05:19] it's because of such and such I got
[1:05:20] this. And it's because of this over
[1:05:22] here. I got this.
[1:05:25] No, you got it because you choose to
[1:05:26] have
[1:05:31] it. Amen. You know, uh, brother me and
[1:05:33] brother Aaron's had this conversation
[1:05:35] several times. him being a teacher, he
[1:05:36] saw a lot of people that were raised up
[1:05:39] in a lot of terrible
[1:05:43] situations. We we were just talking
[1:05:44] about this. Hopefully, I can bring it
[1:05:46] back to my memory. There was there was
[1:05:47] somebody telling the story about two
[1:05:51] boys. One was a successful businessman.
[1:05:54] One was a
[1:05:55] bum. Brothers,
[1:05:58] twins, rather, same mother, twins. And
[1:06:03] here they are. One is this way and one
[1:06:05] is this way. You know why they said
[1:06:07] that? Why? You know when we asked him
[1:06:09] said, "Well, how how how?" I asked the
[1:06:11] man who was very successful said, "Well,
[1:06:13] how did you get this way?" He said, "I I
[1:06:15] I watched my father."
[1:06:18] The other one that was a bomb. He said,
[1:06:19] "How did you get this way?" He said, "I
[1:06:21] watched my father."
[1:06:24] One saw what to do. One saw what not to
[1:06:26] do.
[1:06:29] Amen. You see people that because I
[1:06:31] don't want to preach this in a way
[1:06:33] because we were put here as as free more
[1:06:35] agents.
[1:06:37] Amen. When it comes to life, we have a
[1:06:39] choice.
[1:06:42] We have a choice to lay stuff down and
[1:06:44] not go back to it and say, "I'd rather
[1:06:47] die."
[1:06:53] Adam had a choice. He could have come
[1:06:54] out and said, "God, I'm sorry." But no,
[1:06:56] he hid it all. And this is what people
[1:06:58] are good at. They're good at hiding
[1:07:00] stuff and and staying behind complexes
[1:07:02] and things and allowing all this stuff
[1:07:05] to stay there, you know, and keep them
[1:07:06] hidden and and the true reason why
[1:07:08] they're in the condition that they are.
[1:07:10] But if there's a seed of God on the
[1:07:11] inside of them, God's going to call it
[1:07:14] out. That's right.
[1:07:16] Amen. There's a time when hiding's going
[1:07:19] to be over with. Adam, where art thou?
[1:07:26] Adam was hiding. God calling Adam.
[1:07:28] That's the nature of a sinner. Run away.
[1:07:30] Get behind something. But God's calling.
[1:07:32] He said, "What was it?" His grace.
[1:07:33] Amazing grace. Now, notice you say,
[1:07:36] "Well, that was Adam and Eve." It's
[1:07:38] always through the Bible. Jesus said,
[1:07:39] "No man can come to me except my father
[1:07:42] draws him." That's the word. That's the
[1:07:44] way we want it. The word. That's when
[1:07:45] you know you're where you're standing.
[1:07:47] He said, "How many How many in here are
[1:07:48] Christians tonight? Know you're
[1:07:50] Christians."
[1:07:52] Amen. All right. There's something in
[1:07:55] you says you're a Christian. All right.
[1:07:56] Then why should why you that why you
[1:07:59] should be the happiest people in the
[1:08:01] world? You should just believe that.
[1:08:03] That's easy. Take God's word for it.
[1:08:06] Before you can become a Christian, God
[1:08:08] called you.
[1:08:11] Amen. Now you're calling God. It wasn't
[1:08:14] you calling God. God called you. He
[1:08:17] called Abraham. He's the father of his
[1:08:19] all. He said, Abraham, what was it? It
[1:08:21] was election. That's right.
[1:08:25] It was God's election coming down. He He
[1:08:28] said, "Now, you didn't want to maybe you
[1:08:30] didn't want to become a Christian."
[1:08:31] Amen. Because you you become a Christian
[1:08:33] before you know in the world and all the
[1:08:35] things in the world. But before you were
[1:08:37] born, God ordained you to be a
[1:08:39] Christian. Maybe you didn't want to.
[1:08:42] Maybe you fought against him. Maybe you
[1:08:43] tried not to.
[1:08:46] But before the foundation of the world,
[1:08:47] God ordained you.
[1:08:52] That's why when you heard that, Adam,
[1:08:55] where art thou? Adam, where art thou?
[1:08:59] Something on the inside was greater than
[1:09:01] that want or that desire to be something
[1:09:04] else.
[1:09:11] You know, we use that gifts and callings
[1:09:13] without repentance because uh towards
[1:09:15] ministry and it does apply there. No
[1:09:17] doubt. Amen. Because you see a lot of
[1:09:20] men that are called and gifted but yet
[1:09:23] their lives are still still in a
[1:09:26] mess. Brother Brandon would take that
[1:09:28] and he says if somebody asks him a
[1:09:30] question about being a preacher and he
[1:09:31] says now he says he says now you can't
[1:09:33] just be a preacher because you want to
[1:09:35] be a preacher. He said, "Matter of fact,
[1:09:37] most of the times those people ain't
[1:09:39] even really caught
[1:09:41] if you" He said, "And you check your
[1:09:43] motives and your objectives. Your
[1:09:44] motives is, well, it'd be an easier job
[1:09:46] or I don't know how how that's possible,
[1:09:49] but anyway, easier job or easier way or
[1:09:52] easier way to make a living. I'll just
[1:09:54] be a preacher." He said, "See, your
[1:09:56] motives are wrong."
[1:09:58] He said, "But if you'll realize when you
[1:09:59] realize, listen, it ain't what I want to
[1:10:02] do or or because somebody else wants me
[1:10:04] to do it or my daddy wants me to do it.
[1:10:06] It's because God called me to do it."
[1:10:10] And that goes beyond just being a
[1:10:11] preacher or being anybody. Amen. It goes
[1:10:14] to everybody. I'm not I'm not living
[1:10:16] this because my daddy wanted me to or my
[1:10:19] mama wanted me to or or even I wanted
[1:10:22] to. I'm doing it because God put it
[1:10:24] inside of me.
[1:10:26] God placed it there and there ain't
[1:10:28] nothing the devil can do to take it out
[1:10:30] of me.
[1:10:32] Come on, somebody.
[1:10:38] Before you're born, God ordained you to
[1:10:40] be a Christian from the Garden of Eden,
[1:10:41] before the foundation of the world.
[1:10:43] Says, "Is that right?" He said, "That's
[1:10:44] the truth. Before you you ever knew
[1:10:47] anything," he said, "There was a time
[1:10:49] your mind was darkened to that." Now,
[1:10:52] there was there only been one man on
[1:10:54] earth that knew that he was before and
[1:10:56] that was Jesus. Knew what he was before
[1:10:59] and that was Jesus. He said, "Glorify
[1:11:01] me, Father, with the glory that I had
[1:11:04] with you before the foundation of the
[1:11:06] world." He was the incarnate God. He
[1:11:08] could move back there and know where
[1:11:09] what it was. But our minds are blackened
[1:11:12] to there. But we are ordained
[1:11:15] predestinated. He said, "You know what
[1:11:17] predestinate means?
[1:11:19] The destination of anything was pre-saw
[1:11:23] by God.
[1:11:26] Hallelujah. That's what he said in
[1:11:28] Jeremiah 29:11. He said, "For I know the
[1:11:31] thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth
[1:11:33] the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of
[1:11:35] evil to give you an expected end."
[1:11:39] Amen. I predestinated you. I' I've
[1:11:42] already saw you over on the other side.
[1:11:47] He already has seen the end from the
[1:11:49] beginning
[1:11:51] or the beginning from the end. He's
[1:11:53] already saw how it's going to work out
[1:11:55] and how it's going to be. He's not
[1:11:58] necessarily concerned about all this
[1:12:00] that goes on in between. He just said,
[1:12:02] "I saw you at the beginning. Therefore,
[1:12:04] I know what you'll be at the end."
[1:12:08] Come on. It's the same God that said
[1:12:10] that to the children of Israel. He said,
[1:12:11] "I'm going to take you out of a land,
[1:12:13] but I'm going to take you into a land."
[1:12:15] God already saw him there. Regardless if
[1:12:18] they saw themselves there or not. That's
[1:12:20] right.
[1:12:21] Many times all they saw was a Red Sea or
[1:12:24] a problem or a situation. God already
[1:12:26] saw him over
[1:12:31] there. Ephesians the first chapter Paul
[1:12:33] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[1:12:35] of God. No, he said no seminary sent me
[1:12:38] out. the will of God to them which are
[1:12:42] at Ephesus to the faithful in Jesus
[1:12:45] Christ. Watch what he's addressing
[1:12:47] straight to. Not to a sinner, not to a
[1:12:50] baby, but to them that have grown up.
[1:12:52] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:12:55] will of God. Look, grace be unto you and
[1:12:57] peace from the Lord from God the Father
[1:12:59] and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed
[1:13:01] be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[1:13:03] Christ, who has blessed us with all
[1:13:05] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:13:07] in Christ Jesus. Who's he addressing?
[1:13:10] Not a bunch of babies, but to people
[1:13:12] that sat in heavenly places and are
[1:13:15] blessed. He said, "You know something?
[1:13:17] You've been taught. You're saved. And I
[1:13:19] want to tell you what it's all about." I
[1:13:20] like that. He said, "Don't you? I want
[1:13:22] you to put your feet up in the heavens a
[1:13:25] little while."
[1:13:27] Hallelujah. Instead of being so
[1:13:29] earthbound, said, "Now, I want to tell
[1:13:32] you why. I want to give you a little
[1:13:34] boost, a little revival, a little
[1:13:35] stimulation." Amen. I like that. the
[1:13:37] stimulation that kind of builds you up
[1:13:39] especially when you know where you can
[1:13:41] say is thus sayeth the Lord. Now I want
[1:13:44] to speak to you. He says you have been
[1:13:46] set in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:13:48] and been blessed together with all
[1:13:51] spiritual blessings the gifts of God
[1:13:54] manifesting
[1:13:57] divine healing prophecies and everything
[1:13:59] going forth. He said now you're grown up
[1:14:01] people. I want to talk to you. I'm
[1:14:02] addressing this to you now. Watch. He
[1:14:05] said I hope I hope you get it. I'm going
[1:14:07] to let it soak in real good now.
[1:14:09] According as he hath chosen us in him.
[1:14:12] Who
[1:14:15] did? I heard it. Not come, brother. No,
[1:14:19] you never did. He hath chosen you. Hath
[1:14:23] chosen you. Past tense.
[1:14:27] Hath chosen you. The church, us, you in
[1:14:30] him. How long ago, Paul? last week when
[1:14:35] I was a camp
[1:14:38] when there was the last revival. No,
[1:14:40] before the foundation of the world.
[1:14:44] This is why you why you're saying this
[1:14:45] so much because I want you to understand
[1:14:48] where you are standing at.
[1:14:51] You're not standing on something you
[1:14:52] received just a few days ago. You're
[1:14:55] standing on something that was given
[1:14:57] before the world ever began.
[1:15:02] He said, "Now you can ride on the
[1:15:04] cloud." See what he done? He chose us in
[1:15:06] him, Christ before the foundation of the
[1:15:09] world. Amen. That what we should be
[1:15:13] holy.
[1:15:16] Amen. He didn't choose me because I was
[1:15:19] holy.
[1:15:21] He didn't choose me because I could
[1:15:22] scroll quote all the quotes or I could I
[1:15:25] could say all the scriptures or I could
[1:15:27] roll up the scrolls and I could put a
[1:15:29] pen through it and tell you where
[1:15:30] everything dotted touch. No sir, I
[1:15:33] couldn't do none of that. Matter of
[1:15:34] fact, I was lost and I was undone. I was
[1:15:38] gone as far as the world could ever see.
[1:15:40] Amen. But God rich in mercy. He chose me
[1:15:44] that I could be holy. That I should be
[1:15:48] holy. It's not my holiness. It's his
[1:15:51] holiness.
[1:15:53] That's right.
[1:15:57] My holiness. Your holiness is nothing.
[1:16:00] It's his holiness.
[1:16:03] Well, you say, "Well, do you believe
[1:16:05] that you can do this or do that?" Said,
[1:16:07] "I never said that. Look at a grain of
[1:16:08] wheat can only produce wheat. It can't
[1:16:11] produce cocka birds."
[1:16:15] So in other words, if you if you really
[1:16:16] believe it like this, Brother Brandham,
[1:16:18] don't you believe that you can still sin
[1:16:19] or you can still do wrong or you can
[1:16:21] still do that. No, he's speaking to
[1:16:23] people that have grown up filled with
[1:16:26] the Holy Ghost, adopted sons and
[1:16:28] daughters of Jesus
[1:16:31] Christ. Amen. He says if there's a life
[1:16:35] of a cockaur still in you, you're going
[1:16:37] to produce cockaurs.
[1:16:41] If there's a life of a sticker or a
[1:16:43] cactus or something on there at you,
[1:16:44] that's what you're going to produce. But
[1:16:46] if there's a life of Jesus Christ in
[1:16:48] you, then that's what you're going to
[1:16:50] produce.
[1:16:52] So don't be deceived. Said you better
[1:16:54] search through this close now. See, if
[1:16:56] he keeps on saying, "Well, I I don't
[1:16:58] condemn. It don't condemn me to do this.
[1:16:59] It don't condemn me to do that." Things
[1:17:01] of the world. He said, "I'm hurt you a
[1:17:03] little bit. Pull the feathers back the
[1:17:04] other way." But this is one sure
[1:17:06] evidence you've never been to Jesus
[1:17:08] Christ. Amen. If the things of the world
[1:17:12] don't condemn you, you never been to
[1:17:13] Jesus Christ. Amen. You never been born
[1:17:17] again. He that loves the world or the
[1:17:18] things of the world, the love of God's
[1:17:20] not in him. Amen.
[1:17:24] He said, "Now you can just quit doing it
[1:17:26] because you know you not ought not to
[1:17:28] and quit doing this and quit doing
[1:17:29] that." He said, "That's a sign you ain't
[1:17:31] got nowhere yet. But when that thing
[1:17:33] becomes dead,
[1:17:36] I didn't quit it. It's dead.
[1:17:39] Cuz if you quit something, you can go
[1:17:42] back to starting it over again. Well, if
[1:17:44] that dude is dead, you can't go back and
[1:17:46] pick it up.
[1:17:48] Amen. Amen. When it's dead, it's gone.
[1:17:50] It's done away with. The nature of is
[1:17:52] done away. There's another person in
[1:17:53] there. And it can only produce the Holy
[1:17:55] Spirit that was in Christ is in you.
[1:17:58] It'll produce the Christlike life.
[1:18:00] Nothing you do is what he did. He chose
[1:18:03] that before the foundation of the world.
[1:18:05] Come on. Someone said, "Well, I know I
[1:18:07] got saved because I quit smoking." That
[1:18:09] wasn't why I got saved. That wasn't why
[1:18:11] you got saved. You got saved because God
[1:18:14] chose you
[1:18:16] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:18:18] saved. That's scripture teaching. Amen.
[1:18:21] That's when we begin to feel find out
[1:18:23] it's not about me. It's all about him.
[1:18:27] He chose me.
[1:18:32] Because you know all that prof confess
[1:18:35] or profess Christ is not Christians.
[1:18:39] Direct quote. All that go to church are
[1:18:42] not Christians.
[1:18:49] All Abraham's seed
[1:18:51] wasn't that that all all Abraham's seed
[1:18:54] that had the promise. It was an elect.
[1:18:56] It was a promise. The promise was
[1:18:58] foretold to Abraham. The elect of God
[1:18:59] were for ordained before the foundation
[1:19:01] of the world. Neither because they were
[1:19:03] a seed of Abraham or they they are they
[1:19:05] the children. But in Isaac shall thy
[1:19:07] seed be called. Not in the rest of the
[1:19:10] Jews. Abraham had other seeds.
[1:19:13] But out of Isaac thy seed shall be
[1:19:15] called. That's the rest of the He said,
[1:19:17] "Not in the rest of Jews, but in Isaac,
[1:19:18] though Isaac, through Isaac came
[1:19:20] Christ." It was Abraham's seed in
[1:19:22] Christ. And the seed of Abraham first
[1:19:24] wasn't through sexual seed. It was his
[1:19:26] faith that God reckoned. It wasn't
[1:19:28] through faith in it. It is through faith
[1:19:30] in us and to believe the death, burial,
[1:19:32] and resurrection of Christ brings us to
[1:19:34] be Abraham's seed. And Abraham was
[1:19:37] circumcised as a seal, the promise of
[1:19:39] his faith. He didn't receive it because
[1:19:41] he was circumcised. He received the
[1:19:42] promise before he was circumcised.
[1:19:45] But the promise brought the
[1:19:47] circumcision.
[1:19:55] He received Romans 4 tell you that he
[1:19:57] received the promise before he was
[1:19:59] circumcised. When he was given circumcis
[1:20:01] as a seal to be of his obedience of
[1:20:05] faith that's why the different brothers
[1:20:07] Billy Graham Charles Fuller Billings and
[1:20:08] all them why were they're talking about
[1:20:10] them Baptist brother and I told them
[1:20:12] many of them so Rufus Mosley and other
[1:20:14] whole bunch said well we had 20,000
[1:20:16] converts to in two weeks and they go
[1:20:19] back and they can't find 20 people. I
[1:20:20] said they wasn't converted.
[1:20:25] Oh, well, they accepted Christ as
[1:20:27] personal savior. I said, they still was
[1:20:29] not
[1:20:30] converted. You're not unconvert. Convert
[1:20:33] means to be changed.
[1:20:36] Peter had believed on the Lord. He had
[1:20:38] been baptized, been given power to heal
[1:20:40] the sick, cast out devils, raise the
[1:20:42] dead. And Jesus told him the night
[1:20:44] before the crucifixion, "After you are
[1:20:46] converted, strengthen your brethren."
[1:20:49] Amen. Amen. Right. Both been been both
[1:20:52] saved and sanctified but hadn't been
[1:20:54] converted. That's scripture. Oh, what
[1:20:56] was he sanctified? Yes, sir. Sanctify
[1:20:58] them, Father, through the truth. You
[1:21:00] think he'd put that spirit in a vessel
[1:21:02] that wasn't fit? No. They went out, but
[1:21:04] they cast out devils. They came back
[1:21:06] shouting. He said, I've seen different
[1:21:07] ones. Methodists, different one
[1:21:08] returning, praising God. Said, "Oh, the
[1:21:11] devils are subject to us." What did
[1:21:12] Jesus say? Don't rejoice because devils
[1:21:15] are subject to you, but rejoice because
[1:21:17] your names are written in heaven.
[1:21:20] Amen. What was he saying? Listen, you're
[1:21:23] going to receive the spirit to overcome.
[1:21:25] That's what you need to rejoice about.
[1:21:34] You see the virgins, 10 of them wise, 10
[1:21:36] of them foolish. What was the
[1:21:39] difference? Oil.
[1:21:43] oil. What is the oil? The Holy Spirit.
[1:21:48] So, it's not just accepting something
[1:21:50] and saying, "Well, I believe on the Lord
[1:21:52] Jesus
[1:21:53] Christ." No, it's being converted,
[1:21:56] changed, filled with the spirit, coming
[1:21:59] down and moving down with they were all
[1:22:02] virgins, live good, clean lives. He
[1:22:05] said, "Well, I I don't go to dances. I I
[1:22:07] don't go to shows.
[1:22:10] That's just a He said that's just a
[1:22:12] moral thing. Unless there has been a
[1:22:14] supernatural something
[1:22:16] happened. This is not because you
[1:22:18] shouted, not because you spoke in
[1:22:19] tongues, not because you jumped up and
[1:22:20] down, not because you did this, but
[1:22:22] something supernatural has happened that
[1:22:25] changed you and put a seal and you're
[1:22:28] sealed away from into God. You're
[1:22:30] anchored then and there shouldn't be
[1:22:32] ever anything ever shake you from it.
[1:22:37] Well, you don't believe in those things.
[1:22:39] He said, "I believe in shouting. I
[1:22:41] believe in dancing. I believe in all of
[1:22:43] this, but that isn't the
[1:22:45] answer." Said it last Wednesday. Well,
[1:22:48] last time I ministered. It isn't. That's
[1:22:50] not what we're seeking after. Do we
[1:22:52] enjoy it? Yes, we do. Does it happen
[1:22:55] when the Holy Spirit falls on somebody?
[1:22:57] Yes, it
[1:23:00] does. Methodists thought they when they
[1:23:03] shouted they had it. They found out what
[1:23:04] they were, you know, they found out they
[1:23:06] were wrong. A lot of them shout and
[1:23:07] didn't have it. Pentecostal came along,
[1:23:09] spoke in tongues, said we got her. But
[1:23:11] they found out they were wrong. Many of
[1:23:12] them spoke in tongues, had nothing.
[1:23:14] Though I speak with tongue of men and
[1:23:16] angels and have not love, it profit me
[1:23:18] nothing. They didn't have it. That's
[1:23:19] right. And that's the reason the whole
[1:23:20] world was deceived by it. And through
[1:23:22] the other thing, that isn't the answer.
[1:23:24] Not any fleshly demonstration or
[1:23:26] emotion, but something has happened in
[1:23:28] here that changed your whole opinion. It
[1:23:31] changed your whole nature. You are
[1:23:33] converted.
[1:23:35] It's not you, but Christ has come into
[1:23:37] you and converted you. And your old
[1:23:39] nature is dead, and your old man is
[1:23:41] dead, and you're now born again into a
[1:23:44] new creation in Christ Jesus.
[1:23:47] That's what we're wanting. That's right.
[1:23:58] We've read a scripture, Esau and
[1:24:01] Jacob. For either child was born, If
[1:24:04] they even knew what was right and wrong,
[1:24:07] the that the election of God might stand
[1:24:09] not of works, but him that
[1:24:12] calleth.
[1:24:16] Whoa. Well, I thought if I did this and
[1:24:18] I thought if I that you have nothing to
[1:24:19] do with it. If you're saved, it's
[1:24:22] because God called you before the
[1:24:24] foundation of the
[1:24:26] world and saved you. As is written, as
[1:24:29] he said it to her, the elder shall serve
[1:24:31] the younger. As is written, Jacob have I
[1:24:33] love, Esau I hated. Before either child
[1:24:36] was born, God said, "I love one and I
[1:24:38] hate the
[1:24:39] other." How could he say that? Because
[1:24:41] he already saw what they were going to
[1:24:43] do.
[1:24:48] It's God's
[1:24:50] word. The
[1:24:51] election is nothing that you had to do.
[1:24:54] It's what God done for you.
[1:24:57] God did it in Christ for you before the
[1:24:59] foundation of the world. All that the
[1:25:01] father has given me will come. All the
[1:25:03] father has given me will come. And he
[1:25:05] that come to me I will no wise cast out.
[1:25:07] Amen. Amen. But what is it? What do you
[1:25:09] what are you fearing? God has promised
[1:25:11] you unconditionally that the love of God
[1:25:14] ringing in your heart. You know that you
[1:25:16] pass from death into life. You love
[1:25:18] everybody and the whole world has become
[1:25:20] different and you anchored and nothing
[1:25:22] moves you happy and move on. Glory to
[1:25:24] God. Let nothing turn you around. Oh,
[1:25:26] you might get out and get cold and get
[1:25:28] shook up a little bit, but that seed of
[1:25:30] God will remain true.
[1:25:34] The Bible said though, we disbelieve,
[1:25:36] yet he cannot.
[1:25:40] He's true. He stands
[1:25:43] faithful. What shall we say then? What
[1:25:46] shall we say then? Is there unrighteous
[1:25:48] in God? God
[1:25:49] forbid. For he said unto Moses, I'll
[1:25:52] have mercy on whom I have mercy, and
[1:25:54] I'll have compassion on whom I
[1:25:56] compassion. Then it's not him that
[1:25:58] willth. Or you say, well, glory to God.
[1:26:00] Hallelujah. I got saved before I die.
[1:26:02] You will. I'll get saved before I die.
[1:26:04] You will. God has something to say about
[1:26:06] that.
[1:26:08] Not him that will, nor him that runth,
[1:26:10] but God that showeth mercy.
[1:26:14] Aren't you glad he showed you mercy in
[1:26:15] your life?
[1:26:18] I just don't believe that go by accident
[1:26:20] you was placed in a certain family to to
[1:26:22] be raised to hear the truth of the hour.
[1:26:24] I don't believe it was by accident that
[1:26:26] God allowed all this to come together
[1:26:28] and you be sitting on the pew tonight
[1:26:30] and and God allow watched over your life
[1:26:32] and he kept you. Amen. And there not be
[1:26:35] something on the inside of you.
[1:26:38] But I believe God has allowed it to come
[1:26:40] where you can see amen tonight. Amen.
[1:26:43] God chose me before the foundation of
[1:26:46] the world.
[1:26:48] Amen. The devil might have had me, but
[1:26:50] he lost me. The devil might have tried
[1:26:52] to cover me up, but God in his mercy
[1:26:55] reached down and he picked me back up
[1:26:58] again. The devil might have crumbled my
[1:27:01] life apart and it might have been laid
[1:27:03] in pieces, but thank God he didn't throw
[1:27:06] the clay away.
[1:27:08] But the master over the clay reached
[1:27:10] down and he picked it back up and he
[1:27:13] said, "Nope, this one's mine.
[1:27:16] It might look broken right now, but I'm
[1:27:18] going to make beauty out of this
[1:27:19] brokenness. I'm going to make something
[1:27:21] so wonderful out of this." And he starts
[1:27:23] to weld all those pieces together. And
[1:27:26] he pushs it together with deity.
[1:27:30] I don't know. I told you about it before
[1:27:31] over there in Japan, how they take those
[1:27:34] broken vessels and many times they're
[1:27:36] broken. somebody's favorite dish. Some
[1:27:38] of them worth a lot of money. Amen. But
[1:27:39] they got a way of taking them and they
[1:27:41] take gold and they begin to put them
[1:27:43] back together with gold.
[1:27:45] And the worth of the latter is greater
[1:27:48] than the former.
[1:27:50] Amen. Because the gold that's on the
[1:27:52] inside of them has made them worth more.
[1:27:54] Though they look broken, though they
[1:27:56] look scarred, though they look all torn
[1:27:58] up, but a master came and he put them
[1:28:01] all back
[1:28:03] together. Hallelujah. This is what God
[1:28:06] has done with some of your lives. Some
[1:28:08] of you were found broken. We were all
[1:28:11] broken and undone. But God, rich in
[1:28:13] mercy, reached down and he said, "I got
[1:28:15] some gold for that. I got some gold for
[1:28:18] that. I can put it right here and I can
[1:28:20] put this piece together and I can put
[1:28:22] this piece together." And now you're
[1:28:25] worth more than the former cuz it's not
[1:28:28] you that doeth the work. It's God that
[1:28:30] liveth on the inside of you.
[1:28:34] Hallelujah. Let's stand together.
[1:28:40] Have faith in your calling. Don't let
[1:28:43] the devil shove you around.
[1:28:46] Well, I only come to the Lord about five
[1:28:48] days ago. No, he had you in his mind
[1:28:51] before the foundation of the world.
[1:28:57] He thought of
[1:28:58] you and he said, "That one's
[1:29:01] mine. That one's mine.
[1:29:04] That one's
[1:29:06] mine. I'm so glad he looked at me and
[1:29:08] said, "That one's
[1:29:11] mine." He said it before the devil ever
[1:29:14] could.
[1:29:16] That one's mine.
[1:29:18] Oh, the devil came along, tried to tear
[1:29:21] me up, turn me upside down and
[1:29:22] backwards, inside out, whatever. Destroy
[1:29:25] my
[1:29:27] life. But God already had his mark on
[1:29:30] me. That's right.
[1:29:32] Said, "That one's mine." And he might
[1:29:35] have found me in a broken place, but he
[1:29:37] puts it all back together by his deity.
[1:29:41] Gold filled
[1:29:43] cracks worth more now than the
[1:29:47] former. What a wonderful thing God has
[1:29:50] done for
[1:29:51] us. That he called us. He loved us when
[1:29:55] we were
[1:29:57] unlovable. What a mighty God. I want to
[1:30:00] just lift your hands to him and just
[1:30:01] say, "Thank you, Lord, for the call.
[1:30:04] Thank you for choosing me, Lord.
[1:30:07] Thank you, Father,
[1:30:08] that I've been found worthy, been
[1:30:12] accounted worthy to escape the things
[1:30:14] that are upon coming upon this earth.
[1:30:16] Cuz you saw me, yet you love me, picked
[1:30:20] me up. You turned me around. You placed
[1:30:22] my feet on solid ground." Oh God, we
[1:30:26] love you tonight, Father. We're so
[1:30:28] thankful, Lord, that you placed your
[1:30:30] life on the inside that seed gene of
[1:30:32] God, on the inside, and demons have
[1:30:34] tried to destroy. Demons have tried to
[1:30:37] kill. Demons have tried to tear down.
[1:30:39] Demons have tried to carry to hell. But
[1:30:42] there was a seed on the inside placed
[1:30:44] there before the foundation of the
[1:30:45] world. And one day, we heard our name
[1:30:48] called as that little eagle in that
[1:30:51] chicken yard. We really looked up and we
[1:30:53] realized, hey, I wasn't born for this
[1:30:55] chicken yard. I wasn't born for the
[1:30:58] things of this world. I wasn't born for
[1:30:59] drugs and alcohol and sexual problems
[1:31:02] and situation. But I was born for the
[1:31:05] heavenlies. I was born to be seated in
[1:31:07] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And God
[1:31:10] rich in mercy called me out of darkness
[1:31:13] into this marvelous light. God, we got
[1:31:15] so much to thank you for. We got so much
[1:31:18] to praise you, Lord. You didn't leave us
[1:31:20] where you found us, but Lord, you saw
[1:31:22] that cup and you reached down and you
[1:31:24] cleaned it all out and you sanctified
[1:31:27] and you justified us and you filled us
[1:31:29] with your spirit and you set us aside
[1:31:31] for service. Oh God, we love you with
[1:31:34] all of our hearts. We praise you,
[1:31:36] Almighty God. I want to thank you
[1:31:38] personally for saving me. I want to
[1:31:41] thank you for choosing me. When you
[1:31:43] could have chose 10,000 other people,
[1:31:45] you chose me, oh God. I thank you Lord.
[1:31:51] I thank you Lord.
[1:31:55] Thank you Jesus.
[1:31:57] Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. So I'll
[1:32:01] throw up my hands and praise you again
[1:32:05] and
[1:32:08] again. All that I have is a
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:21] And I know it's not
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:29] except for a heart singing.
[1:32:41] Oh, I'll throw up my hands. I'll praise
[1:32:46] you again and
[1:32:50] again. All that I have is a heart.
[1:32:58] Oh,

[1:33:35] of
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:39] Hallelujah.
[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:45] Oh, I know it's not
[1:33:48] much, nothing else.

[1:34:10] praise you again and
[1:34:14] again. And all that I have is a high
[1:34:20] [Music]

[1:34:31] not nothing else fit

[1:35:45] again. Oh, I was made for
[1:35:53] more. And why would I make a bed in my
[1:35:59] when a fountain of grace, oh, it's
[1:36:02] running my way? I know why.
[1:36:06] Oh, I was made for more.

[1:37:28] mine?
[1:37:31] Oh, say I know I am yours. Let's sing it
[1:37:34] again. I was made for
[1:37:39] more and a
[1:37:41] while. Oh man. Shame when a fountain
[1:37:47] of running my way. I know I am yours. I

[1:38:25] I was made for

[1:38:37] said
[1:38:39] it. I

[1:39:25] it. It is done. Oh Lord, you

[1:39:36] it. I believe
[1:39:41] it. Oh, yes, Lord. It is done. And you
[1:39:47] are worthy of it all.
[1:39:55] Oh, you're worthy of it
[1:40:01] all. Yes,
