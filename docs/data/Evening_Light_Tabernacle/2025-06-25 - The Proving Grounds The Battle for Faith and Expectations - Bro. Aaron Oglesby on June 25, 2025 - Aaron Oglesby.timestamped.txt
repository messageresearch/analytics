[0:01] Amen. Bring all our needs to him.
[0:03] Brother Johnny, would you come open the
[0:04] service for us in prayer?
[0:07] Amen. As he comes, if you have a need,
[0:09] whether it's that loved one, maybe a
[0:11] friend, a co-orker, you want to just
[0:14] lift up to the Lord. As brother Johnny
[0:16] prays, that does remind me there's a

[16:42] say, "I'm expecting,

[17:38] a move
[17:40] of God. Oh, move.
[17:45] Oh, I'm expecting
[17:48] I'm expecting,
[17:52] anticipating
[17:54] a move
[17:56] of God. Oh,
[18:02] you said it and I believe
[18:08] it. Oh, you said
[18:12] it. Oh, it is done. You said where two
[18:17] or three gather. You said it. Oh, we
[18:21] believe you're here tonight. Father, I
[18:24] believe it. Oh, you said it.
[18:30] It is done. See it again. You said it.
[18:33] You said
[18:36] it. And I believe
[18:40] it. Oh, you said it. And it is to move
[18:47] the immovable.
[18:49] Say, "Move the immovable,
[18:55] break the unbreakable."
[18:59] God we believe.
[19:02] Oh, we believe
[19:05] for it from the impossible.
[19:11] We'll see a miracle.
[19:15] God, we believe.
[19:19] God, we believe
[19:21] from the impossible, from the
[19:24] impossible,
[19:27] we'll see a miracle.
[19:31] God, we believe.
[19:35] God, we believe.
[19:40] Amen.
[19:43] Do you believe for it tonight? Yes.
[19:46] Whatever that it is in your life,
[19:50] whatever situation, whatever need,
[19:53] wherever you stand, you know, we all we
[19:54] all stand in different places with with
[19:57] different with different needs. And
[20:00] the devil would love to come and and try
[20:02] to rob us of our faith or or rob us of
[20:05] our expectations.
[20:07] But tonight, I believe for it. I'm
[20:10] expecting a move of God. not not just in
[20:13] this service, but but in my home, in my
[20:15] family, I'm expecting a a sweep of God
[20:18] to come and take the bride in a rapture.
[20:20] I'm expecting those things because God's
[20:22] word promises it. Amen. Let's talk to
[20:25] him tonight. Father, how we love you,
[20:28] Lord. How grateful we are to have this
[20:30] opportunity to be in your presence,
[20:32] Lord, knowing, Lord, that you are here.
[20:34] Lord, your word declares you're here.
[20:36] And Lord, as we're going to see in the
[20:38] word tonight, you are trustworthy. You
[20:40] can be counted on. Your your word never
[20:42] fails. Lord, we're just thankful tonight
[20:45] that we can have that solid rock to
[20:47] stand upon. Lord, when the world is
[20:49] crumbling, when all around us is
[20:50] crumbling, Lord, sometimes when it seems
[20:52] like our own life might be crumbling,
[20:54] Lord, we can go to the rock that is
[20:57] higher than I. Lord, I just pray tonight
[20:59] that you'll come and anoint our
[21:00] thoughts. Lord, you see what you laid up
[21:02] on my heart and help me to convey it,
[21:04] Father. Lord, help me to convey, Lord,
[21:07] that tonight that time, circumstance,
[21:10] situation, trial, none of that, none of
[21:13] that hinders you, Lord, that you will,
[21:17] Lord, you will come and back up your
[21:20] word in every situation. Speak now, I
[21:22] pray, Father, as we look into your word,
[21:24] may you have your way. We commit it to
[21:26] you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. It's good
[21:30] to be in the house of God tonight, isn't
[21:32] it? Amen. Amen. And if you'll turn with
[21:35] me in the Bibles to in your Bible to
[21:38] second Peter 3 and9. Second Peter
[21:43] 3 and9. And we spoke last time on the
[21:46] proving grounds. And we're going to kind
[21:48] of continue that uh a little bit tonight
[21:51] just in a different different avenue
[21:53] looking at it. We're going to speak on
[21:54] the proving grounds. The battle for
[21:56] faith and expectation.
[21:59] The battle for faith and expectation.
[22:03] says here in second Peter 3:9,
[22:07] it says, "The Lord is not slack
[22:09] concerning his promise as some men count
[22:12] slackness, but is longsuffering to
[22:16] usward, not willing that any should
[22:18] perish, but that all should come to
[22:21] repentance."
[22:23] He is he is not slack.
[22:27] In other words, brother Aaron, why are
[22:28] we still here? Because he's not willing
[22:30] that any should perish.
[22:32] How many of you got loved ones that's
[22:34] still out there that you're claiming?
[22:35] That's why we're still here.
[22:38] That's why we're still here. He's not
[22:40] willing that any should perish and and
[22:42] and he's not slack concerning his
[22:44] promises. It's not that he's forgotten.
[22:46] We're not still here because oh, he he's
[22:48] forgotten us. No, it's just the
[22:49] opposite. He he he's full of grace and
[22:52] mercy and he's making sure that everyone
[22:54] has every possible opportunity to be in.
[22:58] Amen. And we also want to read from from
[23:00] Luke 18:8.
[23:02] And Jesus says this. He says, "I tell
[23:04] you that he will avenge them speedily,
[23:06] nevertheless, when the son of man cometh
[23:10] shall he find faith on the earth." Amen.
[23:14] I pray that the Lord will add his
[23:15] blessings to the reading of the word as
[23:17] you have your seats tonight.
[23:21] I want to go back to this this quote
[23:23] that we read last week and and kind of
[23:25] emphasize part of it where he says that
[23:27] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[23:29] no signs of God's disapproval. And I'm
[23:31] very thankful for that tonight because
[23:33] we have plenty of cloudy skies and
[23:35] plenty of storms of life. Amen. But he
[23:38] says neither are bright skies and and
[23:40] still waves signs of his love and
[23:42] approval. His approval of any of us is
[23:46] only in the beloved. His love is
[23:49] elective which he had for us before the
[23:51] foundation of the world. Does he love
[23:53] us? Ah yes. But how shall we know? We
[23:57] shall know because he said so. And we
[24:00] really anchored on that last week that
[24:02] no matter what's going on, he said so.
[24:04] He said he loves me. And so I can take
[24:06] that to the bank. He says and he
[24:08] manifested that he did love us for he
[24:11] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[24:13] spirit placing us as sons. And now this
[24:16] is kind of more where we're going to
[24:17] spend tonight's service. And how shall I
[24:20] prove my love to him? By believing what
[24:24] he said. How are you going to prove your
[24:27] love to him tonight? By believing, by
[24:29] not doubting, by not backing off the
[24:31] promises that you claim that for your
[24:33] children, for yourself, for your home.
[24:36] Um, just don't back off. Lord, I
[24:37] believe. You said it. I believe it.
[24:40] Amen. That's how we prove it. And he
[24:41] says, "By believing what he said and by
[24:43] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[24:45] trials that he in his wisdoms allow to
[24:49] come to pass." Amen. So, as we begin
[24:52] looking at this tonight, we're talking
[24:53] about the battle for faith and and and
[24:55] expectation. And you know, there's
[24:57] things that each of us desire. And the
[24:59] things I'm desiring tonight may not be
[25:01] exactly what you're desiring. Maybe you
[25:03] need a closer walk. Maybe you're seeking
[25:05] the Holy Ghost. Maybe you need healing.
[25:08] Maybe you you want to see a resto a
[25:10] loved one restored to the house of God
[25:12] as brother Mike talked about. And
[25:14] whatever it may be, I just want to ask
[25:16] you tonight, are you merely wanting and
[25:18] longing for it or are you expecting it?
[25:23] Because there is a big difference. Or
[25:24] are you just wanting that? Are you just
[25:27] hoping that it'll come to pass? Or are
[25:29] you expecting it to come to pass
[25:32] tonight? Amen. Because I believe that we
[25:35] we've been taught by the prophet that
[25:36] you get what you expect. It's not that
[25:39] you get what you hope for and you get
[25:41] what you know you really maybe this will
[25:43] work out, but we get what we expect. And
[25:45] and I'm thankful that we had a prophet
[25:47] in this day that come and and taught us
[25:49] and we're privileged people um to to be
[25:51] to have been the recipients of this
[25:53] message and we're a people that have had
[25:55] the opportunity to to hear the message
[25:58] of restoration in the last day. That
[26:00] makes us a privileged people. There's
[26:02] been a message of restoration and not
[26:03] only have we have we heard it. There was
[26:05] a lot of people that heard it, but we
[26:07] heard it and it turned our hearts. Amen.
[26:10] I'm so thankful tonight to be able to
[26:12] say our hearts have been turned back to
[26:14] the faith of the original fathers. And
[26:16] it's a message to restore the word that
[26:19] had been lost down through the ages. And
[26:21] and you're well taught. You you
[26:23] understand how that down through the
[26:25] dark ages that that truths were lost.
[26:28] And the scripture tells us that the
[26:29] palmer worm and the locust and the
[26:31] cankerworm and the caterpillar had eaten
[26:34] away the truths of the word. Amen. And
[26:37] God's people were being starved of the
[26:40] truth. But he tells us in Joel 2 that
[26:42] the floors will once again be full of
[26:44] wheat and that you shall eat in plenty.
[26:48] Amen. But because all the years, all the
[26:51] truths, all the dynamics, all that had
[26:53] been lost, all these things were going
[26:55] to be restored. Amen. I believe we can
[26:58] stand here tonight and say that's been
[26:59] fulfilled that that the message of
[27:01] restoration has come and that the floors
[27:04] are covered in wheat. What What do you
[27:05] mean by that, brother Aaron? We're not
[27:07] starving for truth tonight. Amen. We eat
[27:10] well. Amen. God has given us a seven
[27:12] course meal and he's he's poured out his
[27:14] word and he's revealed his word and you
[27:16] don't have to beg for it. But tonight,
[27:18] he's just saying come and eat. Amen.
[27:21] From my table. Amen. Amen. Joel 2:26, he
[27:24] says, "And ye shall eat in plenty."
[27:27] Listen, if you're not eating, that's not
[27:29] his problem.
[27:30] He has given it to you. He has supplied
[27:33] it. You You get it in the house of God.
[27:35] You get it on tape. He made sure that
[27:37] the voice came in a time where it could
[27:39] be recorded. You can eat in plenty
[27:42] tonight. Amen. He says, "And be
[27:44] satisfied and praise the name of the
[27:47] Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously
[27:50] with you, and my people shall never be
[27:54] ashamed." I I love that so much. My
[27:57] people shall never be ashamed. Listen,
[27:59] you don't have to worry about getting
[28:01] left holding the bag, as it were. You
[28:03] You don't have to have to worry about
[28:05] about whether or not this is the truth.
[28:08] He is going to back you up. Amen. The
[28:11] word says he heals. He heals. You can
[28:13] testify of his healing. It's not up to
[28:15] us to worry about how it turns out. I'm
[28:17] just going to testify. He said it. He
[28:19] said, "I'll never be ashamed." He said,
[28:22] "I'll never have to back off of." He
[28:23] said he saves and he saves. He says he
[28:26] fills with the Holy Ghost. Then he fills
[28:28] with the Holy Ghost. Amen. His people
[28:30] will never be ashamed. You don't have to
[28:33] worry about him not coming through.
[28:35] Brother Aaron, I'm in a tough spot. You
[28:37] don't have to worry about him not coming
[28:39] through. Life's been hard. I've been
[28:41] down. I don't know what's going to
[28:43] happen. You don't have to worry about
[28:45] him not coming through for you tonight.
[28:48] Amen. You aren't going to have anything
[28:50] to be ashamed of if you're standing on
[28:52] the word tonight. Amen. Just stand on
[28:55] the word and be satisfied and praise the
[28:58] name of the Lord who hath dealt
[29:00] wondrously with you and my people shall
[29:03] never be ashamed. I can testify tonight,
[29:06] he has dealt wondrously with me when I
[29:08] didn't deserve it. He dealt wondrously
[29:10] with me when I was going the wrong way.
[29:12] He dealt wondrously with me in my trials
[29:15] and in my struggles and in my
[29:17] heartaches. He has dealt wondrously with
[29:20] me. Amen. Amen. He said, "I will
[29:23] restore."
[29:24] And he promises in Malachi 4 that he
[29:27] would send Elijah for that restoration.
[29:29] And he's done it. And you tonight are a
[29:32] part of that restoration. And I say
[29:36] again, what a privileged people we are.
[29:39] Don't ever lose sight of that. Don't
[29:41] ever let this just be a tradition. I I
[29:43] just go to Evening Light Tabernacle. I
[29:45] was raised in the message. Brother
[29:46] Brandham was a prophet. Listen, you are
[29:49] a part of the promised restoration of
[29:52] the last days. You are a part. Don't
[29:56] ever think, "Oh, woe is me and little me
[29:58] and these people are this." Listen, you
[30:00] are a part of the restoration tonight.
[30:03] Hallelujah. God had you in mind when he
[30:06] said, "I will restore." Thank you. Thank
[30:08] you, Lord Jesus. I think it's wonderful
[30:11] how God operates
[30:14] because he doesn't expect us to do
[30:16] things on our own,
[30:19] but he provides what he requires.
[30:23] In other words, he he required a life
[30:26] because of the fall, and he said, "But
[30:28] I'll give mine."
[30:30] He he provides what he requires. He he
[30:33] openly expresses the question of of
[30:36] whether he would find faith upon the
[30:38] earth.
[30:39] And it's an important question because
[30:41] we know according to Hebrews 11 that
[30:43] without faith it's impossible to please
[30:45] God.
[30:47] So without faith we can't please God.
[30:49] He's saying will I find faith when I
[30:52] return? And then he makes sure that he
[30:55] would find faith upon the earth by
[30:57] sending a message of restoration to
[30:59] restore the word and turn our hearts
[31:01] back to faith again. He says, "I will I
[31:04] find faith?" And then he makes sure that
[31:07] the answer to his own question is yes, I
[31:09] will. I'm going to send a message that's
[31:12] going to turn their hearts back to
[31:14] faith. There's been a lot of doubt.
[31:16] There's been a lot of defeat. There's
[31:17] been a lot of false doctrine. Will I
[31:19] find faith? Oh yes, I will because I'm
[31:22] going to send the very message that they
[31:24] need to make sure that faith is present
[31:26] in their hearts.
[31:28] Amen. Church, we we we haven't followed
[31:30] cunningly devised fables.
[31:33] All this is is a turn back to the
[31:35] original.
[31:37] It's just a turn back to to the original
[31:40] word. You don't have to worry about
[31:41] being ashamed. You don't have to worry
[31:43] about it being wrong. This message is
[31:46] vindicated and it's manifested itself as
[31:50] truth over and over again. And now it's
[31:53] manifested in a people. It's manifested
[31:56] in a people and it's materialized and
[31:59] eventually it's going to materialize
[32:01] into a body change. It's going to
[32:03] materialize into a rapture. He says, "My
[32:06] people shall never be ashamed."
[32:10] Amen. If you think about it, you know,
[32:12] we live in a time where the religious
[32:15] world has drifted so far from the truth
[32:18] that the truth looks like error to them.
[32:23] It's gone so far away. Listen, young
[32:25] people, old people, adults, whoever you
[32:28] are, get into your Bibles and get into
[32:32] the message and see for yourself. We
[32:35] aren't preaching something that came
[32:37] from William Bran. We aren't preaching
[32:40] the message of a seventh grade Kuckian.
[32:43] You can find everything that we believe
[32:45] and that we preach right here in this
[32:48] Bible.
[32:50] This is the absolute word of God. And
[32:53] there were truths out of it that were
[32:54] lost. There was mysteries in it that
[32:56] couldn't be understood. And God sent a
[32:58] prophet to reveal those things to us
[33:01] that were here all along. Listen,
[33:06] there's nothing in here, nothing in the
[33:08] message that can't be proven by this
[33:10] Bible.
[33:13] It's It's not, well, my church believes
[33:15] and mommy and daddy teaches.
[33:19] It's what the Bible teaches.
[33:21] It's the word of God, and it's been
[33:23] restored to us completely in this day.
[33:26] But but the church had drifted so far
[33:28] that it took the ministry of Malachi 4
[33:31] to restore the truth. A a and it's so
[33:34] far from the ideas of men. It's so far
[33:37] from the ideas of the church world that
[33:39] it's deemed a fable.
[33:42] Think about it. The truth is deemed a
[33:44] fable and the fables are deemed the
[33:46] truth.
[33:48] You're called a cult and yet the Roman
[33:51] Catholic Church walks around worshiping
[33:53] a man.
[33:55] Think about how twisted the minds of the
[33:57] world has become. He came into the world
[34:00] in flesh 2,000 years ago and he was
[34:02] rejected because their expectations were
[34:06] wrong.
[34:07] And he came in this day in a word coming
[34:10] and the church world knew him not. He
[34:12] came to his own to those who who had
[34:14] been part of the early stages of
[34:16] restoration and they received him not.
[34:19] But to those who have received it, to
[34:23] those who have received him, he gives
[34:25] power to be the sons and daughters of
[34:27] God. He gives power to be the overcomers
[34:30] of the age. He gives power to cast down
[34:32] the lie of the enemy. Listen, why aren't
[34:34] you out there? Why aren't you insane
[34:37] like the rest of the world? You've been
[34:39] given power to cast down the lie.
[34:42] Listen, you can't you you you can't
[34:44] receive the lie unless you cast down the
[34:46] truth. then you can't receive the truth
[34:47] unless you cast down the lie. But thank
[34:50] God that those of us that have heard the
[34:52] voice to him that hath an ear, we've
[34:54] been given overcoming power in this day
[34:56] to cast down the lie of the enemy.
[35:00] Hallelujah. We are once again operating
[35:03] in the faith.
[35:06] The faith that Jude spoke of. He's very
[35:09] clear. He says you you must contend for
[35:11] the faith that was once delivered. And
[35:14] once again, we're operating in that
[35:16] faith. And with the restoration of faith
[35:20] came a renewed expectation.
[35:24] A renewed expectation for how God would
[35:27] move and how God would fulfill his word.
[35:30] Brother Brandham says it like this. He
[35:32] says, "Expectation
[35:33] usually is based upon faith." You have
[35:37] to have faith before you can expect
[35:41] anything.
[35:43] You have to have faith before you can
[35:45] expect anything. Listen, evening like
[35:48] tabernacle, regardless of what you're
[35:50] going through right now, our
[35:51] expectations tonight should be higher
[35:54] than ever before. Our expectations
[35:56] tonight should be higher than they were
[35:59] yesterday and higher than they were last
[36:02] Wednesday. Our expectations should not
[36:04] be getting lower and lower, but look
[36:06] around and see each and every day. Look,
[36:09] I don't know about you, but every single
[36:10] day I look out in the world and I say,
[36:12] "My prophet was a true prophet. My
[36:15] prophet told the truth." As I see the
[36:17] world just go deeper and deeper and
[36:19] deeper into insanity.
[36:22] As I see things coming to pass, I say,
[36:24] "This was a true prophet. My
[36:27] expectations are going higher."
[36:30] Expectations for what, brother Aaron?
[36:32] For all of it. For everything that were
[36:35] promised. for your healing, for the
[36:37] restoration of your family, for the Holy
[36:39] Ghost, for our services. My expectation
[36:42] are getting higher. Not less and less
[36:44] and less, but more and more and more.
[36:48] I'm expecting more of the miraculous,
[36:50] more of the supernatural,
[36:52] listen, it just makes sense. The body
[36:54] change, the rapture is going to be the
[36:56] greatest divine healing that's ever
[36:57] taken place,
[36:59] the most giant divine healing. And yet
[37:01] we're going to be in a decline of the
[37:03] supernatural leading up to that moment
[37:06] with people wondering, "Does God still
[37:08] heal? Does God still do the
[37:10] supernatural?" And then all of a sudden,
[37:13] no, the trajectory is going to be just
[37:16] the opposite. There's going to be more
[37:18] power, more supernatural, more
[37:20] overcoming, more lives changed, more
[37:23] people healed, more people filled with
[37:24] the Holy Ghost, more power of God in the
[37:26] church. And then the sweep is going to
[37:29] come over and our bodies are going to be
[37:31] changed and we're going to the meeting
[37:33] in the air. That's my expectations
[37:36] tonight.
[37:37] Hallelujah.
[37:39] Expectations that are anchored in the
[37:41] word. Brother Brandon would say that the
[37:44] church is built high because it's got
[37:45] high anticipations and expectations.
[37:49] He says it has ambitions to go higher
[37:51] and farther. It isn't satisfied where it
[37:54] is.
[37:56] Listen, wherever you're at tonight, I
[37:59] want to encourage you. Don't be
[38:00] satisfied where you are. You've come
[38:02] out. I'm thankful you've come out.
[38:04] You've taken steps with God. I'm
[38:06] thankful for that. You've been filled
[38:07] with the Holy Spirit. I'm thankful for
[38:09] that. But don't stop right there with a
[38:11] one and done. But say, "Tonight, Lord, I
[38:13] need more of you. I want to go higher. I
[38:16] want to go deeper. I need your spirit
[38:18] all in my flesh, Lord. All in my spirit,
[38:20] all in my soul. I want to be consumed by
[38:23] you, Lord Jesus.
[38:26] Hallelujah.
[38:28] Not satisfied with the status quo of
[38:30] just being a church member, but our
[38:33] ambitions and our expectations are built
[38:35] upon the highest peak. Brother Brown
[38:37] said, the most solid rock, Jesus Christ.
[38:42] Hallelujah. He tells us that you can
[38:44] never go above your expectations.
[38:48] Think about that. You can never go above
[38:52] your expectations.
[38:54] So don't be expecting to be a failure.
[38:58] You'll never rise above it. Don't be
[39:01] expecting to just barely make it in.
[39:03] You'll never rise above it. I always
[39:06] say, aim really, really, really, really
[39:08] high for the highest of stars. And if
[39:11] you just fall a little bit short, you're
[39:14] still up there.
[39:17] Lord, I want to be the greatest
[39:18] Christian you called me to be. I'm going
[39:20] to overcome every devil. I'm going to
[39:22] take a rapture. I'm going to be a
[39:24] perfect example of a Christian. Oh, you
[39:26] think so, brother Aaron? That's going to
[39:27] be my expectation. And if I fall just a
[39:30] little bit short, his grace will make up
[39:33] the difference. His grace will make up
[39:36] the difference. But I'm not going to aim
[39:38] low and say I can't and I can't and I'm
[39:40] a nobody. But Jesus, through your blood,
[39:43] through the blood of the lamb, through
[39:45] the perfect sacrifice, I'm aiming to be
[39:47] an overcomer of the age tonight.
[39:50] That's my expectation.
[39:53] I choose to trust tonight for all that I
[39:57] have need of. I'm setting my
[39:59] expectations high.
[40:01] Hallelujah.
[40:03] We've been restored to the faith
[40:06] and we've also had our expectations
[40:08] restored.
[40:12] We were called out. I mean, you think
[40:14] about it. the condition of the church
[40:17] coming through maybe the 1800s in the
[40:20] early 1900s dead and formal and cold and
[40:23] and maybe God didn't do the things that
[40:26] he had done before but it wasn't because
[40:28] God wouldn't but it's because it wasn't
[40:31] the expectation of the people
[40:33] but through a supernatural ministry in
[40:35] this day we begin to see God does those
[40:37] things God moves that way we were called
[40:40] out of dead creeds and we were called
[40:43] above a Sunday and a They religion. We
[40:46] were called into a place where all
[40:48] things are possible. Where you at
[40:50] tonight?
[40:52] What depression is trying to take a hold
[40:54] of your life tonight? Trying to rob you
[40:56] of your joy. I'm telling you, you're in
[40:57] a place where all things are possible.
[40:59] I'm telling you, you're in a place
[41:00] tonight where I would set my
[41:01] expectations that this thing can't hold
[41:03] me. This thing will not destroy me. This
[41:06] lie, the enemy is not taking me down. I
[41:08] will not be brought down to hell. But my
[41:10] expectation tonight is that I'm going to
[41:12] rise above it. I'm going to be healed.
[41:14] I'm going to be delivered. I'm going to
[41:16] be filled fresh and new again in the
[41:17] house of God. All things are possible.
[41:21] Hallelujah.
[41:23] Once again.
[41:26] Once again, because of this message, we
[41:27] believed in the supernatural. Once
[41:30] again, we expected the miraculous. We
[41:33] expected the rapture any day. Amen.
[41:37] Many of you who've been believing for
[41:39] many years,
[41:41] who've been around since back at the the
[41:43] early days, we'll call it, of the
[41:44] message, you never thought we'd be here.
[41:49] You never thought we'd be here. Me as a
[41:51] kid, I never thought I'd be here.
[41:55] You know, you have those very very
[41:57] carnal but things and I'm sure a lot of
[42:00] the kids will understand, maybe you
[42:02] remember of
[42:04] I want to get my driver's license.
[42:09] I want to do things. I want to get
[42:12] married before the Lord comes. And why'd
[42:14] you have those thoughts? Because you
[42:17] didn't expect to be here.
[42:19] You didn't you thought we was going to
[42:21] be gone.
[42:23] And as carnal people, we have carnal
[42:25] thoughts. Sometimes those things are
[42:26] silly and and can't compare at all to
[42:28] the the glory of what's in store for us.
[42:31] But we didn't think we'd be here.
[42:35] Many many of us have heard since birth,
[42:37] Jesus is coming any day. This California
[42:41] is going to sink in the ocean. There's
[42:44] going to be a woman rise in power. We've
[42:47] heard of driverless cars. And truly,
[42:49] many of those things have happened and
[42:51] are happening.
[42:53] Just bear with me for a minute where I'm
[42:54] going with this.
[42:56] And early on in in the message, even I
[42:58] can remember it as a kid, there was
[43:00] there was a great excitement. There was
[43:01] a clarity and a focus on his coming.
[43:05] There was a clarity and a focus and an
[43:07] expectation.
[43:11] And I'm going to use the word terry
[43:12] later on tonight in a positive way
[43:15] because the disciples were told to tar
[43:17] until they were dued with power from on
[43:19] high.
[43:21] But in this situation, it seems like a
[43:25] lot of people have gotten more focused
[43:26] on the carrying than the leaving.
[43:30] And that the cares of life have
[43:32] overwhelmed many of us.
[43:36] And I would say that in this place
[43:37] tonight, if there's anybody, and God
[43:39] have mercy, I don't believe it, but if
[43:41] there's anybody going to miss it, it's
[43:42] not you're not going to miss it because
[43:44] you're out in a crack house somewhere or
[43:47] in a bar somewhere drunk or living a
[43:50] life full of sin. You'll miss it because
[43:52] of the snare
[43:54] of the cares of life.
[43:58] Brother Brandham said, "Easy living
[44:02] was a snare in this day.
[44:04] But I can remember the the the passion
[44:07] and the excitement and the and and the
[44:09] focus on his coming. The you the prophet
[44:11] had been here. The seals were open. The
[44:13] word was restored. Any day now.
[44:17] Any day now.
[44:21] And here we stand.
[44:27] Here we stand waiting.
[44:33] And the question echoes down through
[44:35] time. Will I find faith?
[44:41] Will I find faith?
[44:43] Because see, he's not coming back
[44:45] looking for faith that last a year.
[44:49] He's not coming back looking for
[44:51] fiveyear faith. He isn't looking for
[44:53] revival faith that fades when the
[44:55] special meeting ends.
[44:58] He is he he's not looking for human
[45:01] faith.
[45:02] He's looking for his own faith that he
[45:05] deposited. It's an eternal faith. Faith
[45:08] that is time-t tested and faith that'll
[45:11] hold in the trials. Faith that'll hold
[45:13] in the testing. He's looking for faith
[45:15] that operates the promises. He's not
[45:18] just looking for faith that says, "I
[45:19] believe." But he's looking for faith
[45:21] that manifests Jesus to a dying world.
[45:24] He's looking for faith that says John
[45:26] 14:12 is for us. The works that he did
[45:29] shall we do also. He's looking for faith
[45:31] that cast out devils, that lays hands on
[45:33] the sick. He's looking for faith that
[45:35] leads to overcoming lies. It's his
[45:38] faith. It's timeested faith. Faith that
[45:43] manifest Christ in a bride body and
[45:46] faith that stands even in the waiting.
[45:51] Faith that stands in the waiting.
[45:53] Brother Brown says he's looking for
[45:55] timeested memorials.
[45:57] people that thought he was coming 40
[45:59] years ago, but they're still here, still
[46:02] standing, still fighting, not wavering,
[46:04] but going, "I know he's coming. He's
[46:07] still coming. He said it, and I believe
[46:08] it." Amen.
[46:11] There's my servant. I've tested him.
[46:13] I've tried him. I've put him through
[46:14] like Job. He still proves 100%.
[46:18] God be merciful to us that we can take
[46:21] God at his word.
[46:24] Notice it doesn't say anything about
[46:26] time. Just take God at his word
[46:31] and be timetested
[46:34] memorials. Not for 10 years.
[46:37] Time tested no matter how long it takes.
[46:40] He said, "But he's got a church that's
[46:42] tested. Went through the trials,
[46:45] through the losses, through sickness,
[46:48] through sorrow, through death, and still
[46:51] standing with a testimony. Amen. Listen,
[46:54] he couldn't come back then. There was
[46:57] many of us wouldn't have even been
[46:58] there. But not only that, he didn't just
[47:01] want to pull us out before things got
[47:03] hot. He wanted a time-t tested memorial.
[47:06] A faith that would stand in death. A
[47:08] faith that would stand in sorrow and
[47:10] stand in sickness. Stand when friends
[47:12] walk away and still stand with a
[47:14] testimony. I believe God's word no
[47:18] matter what. It's a battle for faith and
[47:22] expectation.
[47:24] He says, "That's the man." Yes, that's
[47:26] the man he's looking for. I don't care
[47:28] if you're a popper. I don't care if
[47:29] you're a beggar. I don't care if you're
[47:31] a rag picker. Whatever you are, God puts
[47:34] the test to you. He's looking for
[47:37] timetested
[47:39] material.
[47:41] That's what he's looking for. That's who
[47:43] he's looking for tonight. Not here
[47:46] today, gone tomorrow, up and down, in
[47:48] and out, on the mountaintop today,
[47:51] struggling tomorrow, but someone who
[47:53] passes the test.
[47:55] What's that mean? That means the tests
[47:56] are coming.
[48:00] Your faith will be tested. Your
[48:02] expectations will be tested.
[48:06] But that faith that he deposited in you
[48:11] will hold.
[48:13] That faith will hold because it's
[48:15] eternal faith living in in in eternal
[48:18] time-tested material. That's what you
[48:21] are. Timeested
[48:25] material. Something that'll hold in the
[48:27] waiting. Many people you hear, "Why are
[48:30] we still here?
[48:32] What's going on? Did we get it right? I
[48:35] I so believe we'd be gone by now.
[48:38] Everything seems so shook up."
[48:41] And I thought this would have happened
[48:42] by now and I thought that would have
[48:45] happened and but I thought
[48:49] there's a whole lot of I thought
[48:54] the prophet leaves the scene. The word
[48:56] is open. We got the pillar of fire.
[48:58] We're excited. We're ready.
[49:01] But then in that time
[49:04] as we're waiting, we start trying to
[49:05] figure it all out
[49:08] because time
[49:11] and we have time and we look at it this
[49:13] way and we look at it that way and we we
[49:15] try to piece it here and we think it's
[49:17] definitely going to be like this and
[49:18] it's definitely going to be like that.
[49:19] And what you do when you start doing
[49:20] those things is you set yourself up for
[49:22] disappointment.
[49:26] You begin trying to figure it out and
[49:28] and time begins to pass and 1977 comes
[49:31] and it's been 12 years since he since
[49:33] the surely surely this is it.
[49:38] And then 1999 comes and it's been 34
[49:41] years. Surely
[49:44] surely.
[49:45] And then 2025
[49:48] going on 60 years.
[49:51] Let me remind you,
[49:54] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[49:56] time,
[49:58] but at the end it shall speak and not
[50:01] lie. Though it tar, wait for it,
[50:07] because it will surely come, it will not
[50:10] tear. The word of God will be made
[50:14] manifest. The word of God is going to
[50:17] come to pass no matter what. Amen.
[50:23] One thing as I began looking into this
[50:25] thought that kept popping up was the
[50:27] word suddenly.
[50:30] And I want to bring that to our
[50:31] attention as we go on just in a few
[50:33] places because as time passes, we begin
[50:36] trying to figure things out in our mind.
[50:38] And we begin to piece things together,
[50:40] fitting this here and fitting this and
[50:42] how it's going to be. And and then time
[50:43] drags on and on and it may be a long
[50:47] time. It may be a thousand years. It may
[50:49] be 60 years like we are. And our
[50:51] expectations begin to change. You watch
[50:55] people, you watch history, you watch the
[50:57] Jews, you watch the church. And the
[50:59] longer the time goes on, the
[51:01] expectations begin to lower and people
[51:04] begin to get lax and people begin to
[51:07] relax. But then suddenly
[51:10] fulfillment.
[51:13] Suddenly it happens like that.
[51:18] Suddenly
[51:19] and when fulfillment comes
[51:23] even though it happens like that we we
[51:25] can't say that it was without warning.
[51:28] Even if the warning came a hundred years
[51:30] ago or a thousand years ago, if he said
[51:33] it was going to happen, that was your
[51:35] warning.
[51:37] That was the warning. That was his word.
[51:39] And you know his word is true and you
[51:41] know it's going to come to pass.
[51:44] But everything's going to wrap up
[51:46] suddenly. Brother Aaron Le, see it's
[51:48] going on longer than I thought it would.
[51:50] Don't worry, it's going to end suddenly
[51:52] when you least expect it. on just
[51:54] another day when you're getting up to go
[51:56] to work, you're getting up to go to
[51:58] school, you're getting up on a Sunday,
[52:01] suddenly
[52:04] it happens.
[52:08] Mark 13:35,
[52:10] "Watch ye therefore, for you know not
[52:13] when the master of the house cometh at
[52:15] even or at midnight or at the
[52:17] crowing or in the morning less coming."
[52:21] Suddenly he find you sleeping.
[52:25] And what I say unto you, I say unto all.
[52:28] Watch.
[52:30] What is this? This is an expectation.
[52:33] You don't watch for things that you're
[52:34] not expecting. You don't look down the
[52:36] driveway for somebody you're not
[52:38] expecting to come.
[52:40] Why? Why? Why' the daddy see the prodal
[52:42] coming down the road so many miles away?
[52:44] Why was he looking down the road? He was
[52:46] expecting him.
[52:48] He was expecting the fulfillment of the
[52:50] promise. That's what watch is here. Be
[52:52] expecting.
[52:54] Be watching because I'm coming suddenly.
[52:57] Watch. Expect. It goes hand in hand. But
[53:01] if you're expecting it, then you'll be
[53:03] watching for it and you'll recognize it
[53:06] and you won't be caught unaware.
[53:09] Amen. First thing you have to have is
[53:12] expectations
[53:14] for God to fulfill his word. If you're
[53:16] going to get anything from God, you got
[53:18] to have expectations.
[53:20] Think about it like this. In the days of
[53:22] Jesus, why didn't anybody else see the
[53:25] star?
[53:27] Why did nobody else see the star? Why
[53:30] just the wise men? Brother Brandham
[53:32] tells us, he said, because the wise men
[53:33] was looking for it. He says they were
[53:36] expecting it. It had been a thousand
[53:38] years since Balam's prophecy, and yet
[53:41] they were still looking for it. Maybe
[53:43] others looked for a while. Maybe others
[53:46] watched for a hundred years. Maybe
[53:48] others watched for 200 years. Maybe
[53:50] people studied with them for a long,
[53:52] long time.
[53:54] But they watched all the way until
[53:56] fulfillment. Listen, following this
[53:59] message is good, but following it to
[54:00] right now ain't good enough. Following
[54:02] it for 20 years ain't good enough.
[54:04] Saying, "I believe a prophet ain't good
[54:06] enough." You got to follow it with your
[54:08] whole heart all the way to the
[54:10] fulfillment.
[54:11] All the way to the rapture. It's not
[54:13] time to get laxed. It's not time to
[54:15] relax. It's not time to step back and
[54:17] back off your expectations. But let your
[54:20] expectations go higher tonight.
[54:27] Maybe others expectations faded due to
[54:29] the passage of time, but suddenly there
[54:32] was a star.
[54:35] And as time passes, we're in danger of
[54:37] our expectations changing.
[54:43] The devil doesn't have to get you to
[54:45] recant.
[54:47] The devil doesn't have to get you to
[54:49] renounce.
[54:50] He only has to get you to relax.
[54:55] He only has to get you to relax. He only
[54:57] has to get you to expecting the wrong
[54:59] things and putting your faith in the
[55:01] wrong places to get you to miss it.
[55:05] Time-t tested people with time-t tested
[55:08] faith. So don't let it concern you when
[55:11] we have to wait.
[55:14] Be expecting.
[55:17] We're going to be tried to see if we
[55:19] will back off or lower our expectations
[55:21] or if we'll even allow, and this is one
[55:23] that I think a lot of people deal with,
[55:26] but if we'll even allow our own
[55:28] expectations that we have created in our
[55:31] own mind to challenge our faith.
[55:35] Think about expectations that that we
[55:37] create for how God is going to deliver
[55:39] me. Expectations that we create of how
[55:42] God's going to wrap this all up and
[55:45] expectations for how God heals or when
[55:47] God heals. And we start grasping at
[55:50] things when we go through trials.
[55:53] We start grasping at at things and and
[55:55] we see a little glimpse of something and
[55:56] we say, "Oh, this is it." And God's
[55:59] moving and and and this is setting up
[56:01] perfect and and there's just no way that
[56:03] God isn't in this. and and and and the
[56:05] way it's all lined up and the way we
[56:07] were all here and and then this happened
[56:08] and that happened and it couldn't be a
[56:10] coincidence. this is God and he's going
[56:12] to do it just like this. And then it
[56:15] doesn't happen
[56:18] and people are shook and people but I
[56:21] thought God
[56:25] that was your own expectation of how God
[56:28] was going to do it of how God was going
[56:31] to move of how he was going to work. And
[56:33] we allow it to shake us. And we find
[56:36] people do this every time there's a
[56:38] conflict in the Middle East.
[56:41] every time. This is it.
[56:45] This is it. This is the one we've been
[56:46] waiting on. And you just watch. Now,
[56:48] Russia's going to come and they're going
[56:50] to join with this and there's this
[56:51] article and there's this and now they're
[56:53] going to go for the oil and get ready
[56:55] and then there's a peace treaty.
[57:01] And it's okay. There's nothing wrong
[57:02] with watching those things because those
[57:03] things are going to happen
[57:06] and it will be a true fulfillment. But
[57:08] what happens is people begin to build
[57:10] up, build up, build up, and they get on
[57:13] pins and needles with great expectation.
[57:15] And then what happens when there's a
[57:16] ceasefire or whatever is they relax.
[57:20] What I'm saying is is don't ever relax.
[57:23] Live on pins and needles. Live in
[57:26] expectation. Live like you just heard
[57:28] that they're invading Israel and the war
[57:30] is happening every single day. Live like
[57:32] he's coming tomorrow. Don't relax.
[57:36] Don't let your expectations come down.
[57:38] Keep them at that place.
[57:42] Keep them there.
[57:44] Because it's in that relaxing where the
[57:46] devil comes in. It's in that relaxing
[57:48] where he begins to move and and come in
[57:51] and sew doubt. But people put so much on
[57:54] it and they build it up and then a lull
[57:57] happens. Well, that wasn't it. And they
[58:00] let their guards down.
[58:03] Quit trying to figure everything out and
[58:05] let it happen.
[58:07] God says it's going to happen. God says
[58:09] I'm going to have a church without spot
[58:11] or wrinkle. God says there's going to be
[58:12] a rapture. God says there's going to be
[58:14] a body change. How's it going to happen,
[58:16] brother? And don't know, don't care.
[58:18] Just want to be ready. Just want to have
[58:20] my heart bright. Want to have my soul
[58:22] right? Want to be living every day
[58:24] looking for his appearing.
[58:28] I don't have to figure it all out.
[58:32] God said it would happen. The word said
[58:34] it would happen. California's been
[58:36] prophesied to sink. It's going to
[58:37] happen.
[58:40] America prophesied to be destroyed. She
[58:43] will be.
[58:45] All nations are prophesied to get
[58:46] together against Israel and they will.
[58:49] The word says the bride will have a
[58:51] rapture and she will.
[58:54] Does not matter how long it takes.
[58:57] Does not matter if it's in the next year
[58:59] or the five or the 10. Doesn't matter.
[59:02] It's going to take place.
[59:04] Hallelujah.
[59:08] Doesn't matter how long ago the
[59:09] prophecies were given.
[59:12] And I know young people deal with this
[59:13] sometimes. Well, brother Bram said this
[59:15] and it's been 60 years. Doesn't matter.
[59:20] Well, that they said this and it's been
[59:21] this many years. It doesn't matter how
[59:23] long ago the prophecy was given. Doesn't
[59:24] matter how long the prophet's been gone.
[59:26] Time tested faith.
[59:31] Quit going up and down with your own
[59:32] ideas of how it will be and and how it's
[59:35] all going to work out and just live
[59:37] ready.
[59:38] Just live ready. Just live expecting.
[59:41] Live life as if he's coming tonight
[59:43] because he may.
[59:46] Listen, if he came today, there's
[59:49] nothing he would have to explain to you.
[59:52] Well, brother, but but but but I thought
[59:54] this was going to happen. I thought,
[59:55] listen, if he came today, we've had
[59:57] enough warning. We've had a prophet that
[59:59] said, "Throw down your whly bag of
[1:00:00] peanuts and get on the train." We've had
[1:00:03] a prophet tell us to be watching. Be
[1:00:05] ready. Get your lambs trim trimmed and
[1:00:07] clear. He doesn't owe you an
[1:00:09] explanation. He said, "I'm coming." And
[1:00:11] he's coming. Be ready for that coming
[1:00:13] tonight. Have your expectations ready.
[1:00:18] It was the It was the piecing together
[1:00:20] and the figuring out in the times of
[1:00:22] waiting that caused the Jews to miss it
[1:00:25] so bad.
[1:00:27] Their expectations got off because they
[1:00:29] had it all figured out.
[1:00:32] Malachi 3:1, "Behold, I send my
[1:00:34] messenger, and he shall prepare the way
[1:00:37] before me, and the Lord whom you seek
[1:00:39] shall suddenly come to his temple. even
[1:00:43] the messenger of the covenant whom ye
[1:00:45] delight in. Behold, he shall come,
[1:00:47] sayeth the Lord of hosts.
[1:00:50] It had been 400 years since Israel's
[1:00:54] last prophet, Malachi.
[1:00:56] And see, the danger lies in in what we
[1:00:58] might call the lol or the or or the
[1:01:01] interval between the prophecy and the
[1:01:04] fulfillment, the time between.
[1:01:07] See, prophets see way out.
[1:01:11] They see way out because they rise up to
[1:01:13] a higher plane and they're able to see
[1:01:14] it as if it's happening right now. And
[1:01:17] then they prophesy under the urgency of
[1:01:20] it.
[1:01:23] And so the people that hear it hear the
[1:01:25] urgency, feel the urgency. Oh, this is
[1:01:27] it.
[1:01:30] Think about it.
[1:01:32] He will suddenly come to his temple
[1:01:35] generation after generation after
[1:01:38] generation after generation.
[1:01:42] He ain't showed up yet.
[1:01:44] But listen to brother Brown explain how
[1:01:46] a prophet works.
[1:01:48] He says a prophet foresees way off see
[1:01:51] the things that is coming. He sees the
[1:01:53] cup of God's wrath full before it is
[1:01:55] filled. He can say thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:01:58] God will destroy this city except you
[1:01:59] repent. Why? He's an eagle. He rides way
[1:02:02] in yonder. See, and he looks way off
[1:02:04] there and he sees that cup of wrath
[1:02:05] poured out. That's what the prophet's
[1:02:07] looking at. He ain't looking what's
[1:02:09] going on here. He's looking yonder. He's
[1:02:12] saying it's coming. He can go so high
[1:02:15] till he can see that shade. He says the
[1:02:17] world will be dark. Darkness and gross
[1:02:19] darkness. He's up high enough. The sun's
[1:02:22] shining now, but he sees the shade
[1:02:24] coming. And he's saying what he's
[1:02:27] looking at. It ain't here yet.
[1:02:30] But it'll sure be here. That's right.
[1:02:33] It's going to be here. Gross darkness
[1:02:36] upon the people. He knows it's coming
[1:02:38] years away. Yet he sees it. He says the
[1:02:42] prophet's only looking off and seeing
[1:02:45] something. He's talking about what he's
[1:02:46] looking at. He ain't thinking about here
[1:02:49] and what you look like now. He's
[1:02:51] looking. It's he's looking what's going
[1:02:54] to be. And when he speaks that, if it's
[1:02:56] in the word of Lord, it's already been
[1:02:57] spoke. There's nothing in the world can
[1:02:59] stop it. You see, that's right. Only God
[1:03:03] himself.
[1:03:05] And under that urgency, it's received
[1:03:07] and the people are expecting it to
[1:03:09] happen. Just like I was talking about
[1:03:11] back in the early days of the message,
[1:03:13] there was an urgency. There was a focus.
[1:03:16] Oh, it's going to happen. And they
[1:03:18] receive that. But then as time goes on,
[1:03:21] they begin to question the validity of
[1:03:23] it. Or maybe he meant this.
[1:03:28] Maybe it's going to happen like this
[1:03:30] instead.
[1:03:34] Think about Sarah. Maybe Abraham, he
[1:03:36] wants it to be fulfilled this way.
[1:03:40] Here, just just just take my handmade.
[1:03:42] Do it like this instead of just taking
[1:03:45] your hands off and trusting,
[1:03:49] keeping your expectations where they're
[1:03:51] supposed to be. Malachi is 400 years out
[1:03:54] and he's prophesying of the forerunner
[1:03:56] and of the Lord coming suddenly
[1:03:59] and 400 years later they're like maybe
[1:04:01] Malachi got it mixed up. I mean it's
[1:04:04] been 400 years suddenly. But then
[1:04:07] suddenly John the Baptist comes walking
[1:04:10] out of the wilderness.
[1:04:12] The forerunner that had been prophesied
[1:04:15] a wild man. Think about it. A wild man
[1:04:18] hadn't been seen since he was 9 years
[1:04:19] old.
[1:04:21] hadn't been seen. He comes out and he's
[1:04:23] he he's he's eating locust and he's
[1:04:25] dressed in camel hair preaching on the
[1:04:28] muddy banks of the Jordan. Repent.
[1:04:30] You must repent. And they're thinking,
[1:04:33] "No, this ain't what this ain't what
[1:04:34] Malachi was talking about. Matter of
[1:04:37] fact, they didn't even give it no heed."
[1:04:40] Their expectations were in the wrong
[1:04:42] place.
[1:04:44] And so, it completely causes them to
[1:04:45] miss it. And they don't recognize him as
[1:04:47] the forerunner because it isn't what
[1:04:49] they were looking for.
[1:04:51] It isn't what they were expecting and
[1:04:53] yet it was still fulfillment.
[1:04:56] Recognize something. Just because you
[1:04:57] miss it, just because you don't
[1:04:58] understand it, just because you can't
[1:05:00] place it, doesn't mean it hasn't been
[1:05:01] fulfilled. Doesn't mean it's not the
[1:05:03] fulfillment that God had in mind.
[1:05:07] The interval doesn't matter. It didn't
[1:05:09] matter that it had been 400 years. The
[1:05:10] time doesn't matter. How long we have to
[1:05:13] wait for the prophecies of this last day
[1:05:15] messenger to come to pass does not
[1:05:17] matter. If a vindicated prophet spoke
[1:05:20] it, it's going to happen. If it's in the
[1:05:22] Bible, it's going to happen.
[1:05:25] What I'm showing you, I'm going to show
[1:05:26] you more. Long periods between the
[1:05:29] prophecy and the fulfillment are
[1:05:31] scriptural.
[1:05:33] They're normal. Matter of fact, that's
[1:05:35] normally how it goes. Don't let that
[1:05:39] change your expectation.
[1:05:42] Don't let your ideas become your
[1:05:45] expectations. Here's
[1:05:48] your expectations. Amen. It's all in
[1:05:51] here. He's going to come as a thief in
[1:05:54] the night. He's going to catch his bride
[1:05:56] away. Oh yes, Lord. He didn't say when.
[1:06:00] That's okay. I'm going to live ready.
[1:06:02] I'm going to live ready because he
[1:06:03] promised that he's coming. He's promised
[1:06:04] that he's coming back. So don't let your
[1:06:07] own ideas become your expectations, but
[1:06:09] keep your eyes on the promise. Look at
[1:06:11] Isaiah 7:14. Therefore, the Lord himself
[1:06:13] shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin
[1:06:16] shall conceive and bear a son, and shall
[1:06:18] call his name Emmanuel.
[1:06:21] How many years before? 700.
[1:06:26] 700 years before the birth of Christ,
[1:06:29] Isaiah prophesies this. But what's
[1:06:32] amazing to me is these people knew the
[1:06:33] scrolls better than anybody. They knew
[1:06:35] the word better than anybody. I I I
[1:06:37] don't know if it's truth or not, but
[1:06:39] they was said they could take a scroll
[1:06:41] and roll it up and stick a needle
[1:06:42] through it and tell you every word that
[1:06:44] it passed through. They knew it inside
[1:06:47] and out. There's no chance that they
[1:06:49] didn't know this scripture.
[1:06:52] No chance. They knew this scripture.
[1:06:56] They knew a virgin was supposed to
[1:06:58] conceive.
[1:07:00] They were told. And yet, when it comes
[1:07:02] to pass, they act like it's nonsense.
[1:07:06] I can show them serpent seed in the
[1:07:09] Bible and yet they act like it's
[1:07:12] nonsense.
[1:07:13] You can show them predestination
[1:07:16] in the Bible and they act like it's
[1:07:18] nonsense even though it says it plainly.
[1:07:21] You can show them godhead in the Bible
[1:07:23] plainly and they act like it's nonsense.
[1:07:30] I'll never forget
[1:07:32] explaining it to a good friend of mine
[1:07:33] one time on the Godhead and you know
[1:07:35] that everything I believed on it. I say
[1:07:38] everything. It was like a three minute
[1:07:40] summary.
[1:07:42] So, it was brief, but just the best I
[1:07:45] could sum it up. And And he sat there
[1:07:46] and he stared at me for a minute and he
[1:07:48] literally went
[1:07:52] just like that at me. And I was like,
[1:07:54] I'm not sure if he caught a revelation
[1:07:56] or he thinks I've lost my mind. It was
[1:07:59] the second one.
[1:08:03] Thought I'd lost my mind.
[1:08:07] They could see it in the word, but they
[1:08:10] couldn't see it.
[1:08:12] It was so plain. They acted as if it was
[1:08:15] blasphemy. They knew the word so well.
[1:08:18] They knew this verse. Then why could
[1:08:20] they not accept the virgin birth?
[1:08:23] Because over time they had replaced the
[1:08:26] word with their ideas of fulfillment.
[1:08:29] This is how it's going to be. This is
[1:08:31] how he's going to come. This is how it's
[1:08:33] all going to go. And brother Brandham
[1:08:34] says, "Israel asked for a mighty king.
[1:08:36] They wanted a king to deliver them.
[1:08:38] That's what they expected. God to send
[1:08:40] to them was a king to deliver them. A
[1:08:42] mighty king that would march like David.
[1:08:44] The son of David would rise up, come
[1:08:46] down the corridors of heaven, walk down
[1:08:48] to the earth in a full angel salute. And
[1:08:50] the father would look out of heaven and
[1:08:52] say, "I'm sending you, sending down to
[1:08:53] you now the Messiah." And they had it
[1:08:56] all fixed up. That's the way he was
[1:08:59] supposed to come. But what did they get?
[1:09:02] They got a baby instead of a mighty
[1:09:04] king. A baby born in a little stable,
[1:09:06] the side of a hillside, a little cave
[1:09:08] stable with straw and the manure from
[1:09:10] the animals and a baby. But it was the
[1:09:14] answer
[1:09:16] to their prayers.
[1:09:19] He says he was exactly what they needed.
[1:09:24] You ever been in that situation? You
[1:09:25] pray and you pray and pray and the Lord
[1:09:26] send you something. You're like, "What
[1:09:27] are you doing?" Maybe you don't talk to
[1:09:30] him like that. I'm sorry. That was more
[1:09:31] the way we might talk to each other. But
[1:09:33] why'd you send me that, Lord?
[1:09:36] That's not what I asked for. He says, 'I
[1:09:38] ain't worried about what you asked for.
[1:09:40] I know what you need.
[1:09:43] I know better than you know what you
[1:09:45] need. He says, but they wanted it in
[1:09:48] their own way. They want it the way they
[1:09:51] thought was best, but God knows how to
[1:09:53] send it the way he knows is best because
[1:09:55] he's an infinite God, and he knows just
[1:09:57] how to send it. He knows your needs.
[1:10:00] Tonight, listen. Let's just stop for a
[1:10:02] minute. I don't know what you're going
[1:10:04] through. I don't know the struggle. I
[1:10:05] don't know the trial. You may be in the
[1:10:06] deepest, darkest moments of your life.
[1:10:08] He knows your needs. He knows how to
[1:10:12] bring it to you. He knows how to find
[1:10:14] you in a service. He knows what you're
[1:10:16] struggling with at home. He knows. He
[1:10:18] sees the tears on your pillow at night.
[1:10:20] He knows how to find you tonight. And he
[1:10:22] says, "I'm sending you what you have
[1:10:24] need of." So I say, just open up your
[1:10:26] heart and accept it. Say, "Yes, Lord. I
[1:10:28] receive it tonight because you know
[1:10:31] better than me. I receive what you're
[1:10:33] sending me tonight, Lord. But the
[1:10:36] trouble of it is because it don't come
[1:10:37] the way you think it ought to come. Then
[1:10:39] you're all discouraged
[1:10:42] and you hand it back to him.
[1:10:45] Let's ask him and believe that he will
[1:10:48] send it just the way he wants to send it
[1:10:50] and accept it upon the basis. That's
[1:10:53] right. See
[1:10:55] one more. He says they got a manger. So
[1:10:58] what did they do? Had this little babe
[1:10:59] in a manger. What was that? The mighty
[1:11:02] king. They refused him. Yes, sir. Why?
[1:11:04] He didn't come the way they expected him
[1:11:06] to come. I'm trying to drill this into
[1:11:08] you tonight. It don't matter what you
[1:11:10] how you're expecting him to come. Your
[1:11:12] expectations are to be grounded in the
[1:11:14] word of God tonight.
[1:11:17] That's where we're to ground it. And
[1:11:18] friends, you might think that was a
[1:11:19] horrible thing, but you know, we're
[1:11:21] guilty of the same thing. We're guilty
[1:11:23] of the same thing. We ask God for things
[1:11:25] and then we walk around. If he don't
[1:11:27] just pour something on us and give us
[1:11:28] something that we think we ought to
[1:11:30] have, then we just hand it back. Don't
[1:11:33] do that. Ask him. Stay right with it.
[1:11:37] Yes, sir. Hold on to it. If you know
[1:11:40] that it's real. Amen.
[1:11:43] They wanted a king. They wanted a
[1:11:46] deliverer. They wanted a mighty general.
[1:11:49] And I say they got all of those things.
[1:11:52] They got the greatest king. They got the
[1:11:54] mighty conqueror. They got the captain
[1:11:55] of the Lord's host. And yet they could
[1:11:58] not recognize it. Why? Because they
[1:12:00] expected a messiah to be different. But
[1:12:02] he come according to the scripture, but
[1:12:05] it wasn't according to their theology.
[1:12:08] And you know, I believe if he would come
[1:12:09] tonight, it would be alltogether
[1:12:11] different. Watch this now.
[1:12:15] Alltogether different than what we've
[1:12:17] got it figured out. He will come.
[1:12:22] Oh, but we're in the message, brother.
[1:12:26] I've had a lot of things figured out as
[1:12:28] a message believer that turned out I
[1:12:29] didn't have figured out.
[1:12:33] He says, "He will come. He'll always do
[1:12:37] it, but yet it's straight with the
[1:12:40] scripture."
[1:12:41] Let me encourage you again. Get into
[1:12:43] your Bibles. Get into your Bibles
[1:12:46] tonight. They couldn't accept the
[1:12:47] fulfillment
[1:12:49] because of the way it was happening.
[1:12:52] But think about this as we're going to
[1:12:53] be begin to turn this towards home.
[1:12:56] Because I'm talking about us and our
[1:12:58] expectations and how long we've been
[1:12:59] here and we didn't think we would be
[1:13:01] here, but we thought we'd be gone. And I
[1:13:03] don't want our expectations to change in
[1:13:04] the waiting.
[1:13:06] I don't want us to lower our faith in
[1:13:08] the waiting that they were in it.
[1:13:12] They were in it and yet they were
[1:13:14] looking for it.
[1:13:16] They were in the coming of the Lord and
[1:13:18] yet still wondering where it was.
[1:13:21] We We knew him. He He played with our
[1:13:23] children. We knew him at We knew him as
[1:13:26] a teenager. It couldn't be him. And
[1:13:28] remember, it wasn't just unbelievers
[1:13:30] struggling to to get their expectations
[1:13:32] right. It isn't just the Pharisees and
[1:13:34] the Sadducees. The disciples have their
[1:13:37] expectations all messed up.
[1:13:41] Theirs are all messed up. They they got
[1:13:43] it in their heads exactly how it's going
[1:13:45] to go and but they can never seem to
[1:13:46] grasp what's really happening. Well,
[1:13:49] we're following the Messiah. This is
[1:13:51] amazing. He's going to conquer. We're
[1:13:52] the only ones following this truth. And
[1:13:55] then John dies
[1:13:57] and then Jesus dies
[1:13:59] and they're shook.
[1:14:03] They become disillusioned and they
[1:14:05] become disappointed and some leave and
[1:14:07] head off towards Emmas. Why? Why?
[1:14:12] But we trusted that it had been he which
[1:14:14] should have redeemed Israel.
[1:14:17] He didn't do what they thought he'd do.
[1:14:19] We we thought this and and beside all
[1:14:21] this, today's the third day since these
[1:14:23] things were done. And certain women also
[1:14:25] of our company made us astonished which
[1:14:27] were early at the supplr. They said they
[1:14:30] seen him rise. but because it had not
[1:14:32] turned out the way they thought it
[1:14:34] should in their mind, in their opinion,
[1:14:36] according to their understanding, and
[1:14:38] yet it had all gone perfectly with the
[1:14:40] scriptures. It had all lined up purpos
[1:14:43] perfectly. As they walk along, he comes
[1:14:45] out and he joins them and he begins to
[1:14:47] talk with them and he he begins to act
[1:14:49] as if he doesn't know why they're
[1:14:50] troubled. What what's got you down? Why
[1:14:53] are you upset? And they they lay it all
[1:14:55] out to him. Are you a stranger in these
[1:14:57] parts? they say. And they begin to talk
[1:14:59] to him about it and they lay it out and
[1:15:01] we thought and and we thought and we
[1:15:04] thought, but then this happened. And now
[1:15:07] some are claiming he's alive. And you
[1:15:09] know what he does? He rebukes them.
[1:15:14] He rebukes them for not recognizing it
[1:15:16] all foretold in the scripture.
[1:15:20] If you'd have just been paying attention
[1:15:22] to the scripture
[1:15:25] instead of what you'd been taught in the
[1:15:27] synagogue, instead of what daddy thought
[1:15:29] and what this priest thought, if you'd
[1:15:32] have just been paying attention to the
[1:15:33] scripture, you would have known all this
[1:15:35] was going to happen. You would have
[1:15:37] known. Prophets all through the Old
[1:15:39] Testament had prophesied exactly what
[1:15:41] would happen. But they had their own
[1:15:44] idea. And he says to him, then he said
[1:15:47] unto them, "Oh fools and slow of heart
[1:15:49] to believe all that the prophets had
[1:15:51] spoken. Ought not Christ who have
[1:15:53] suffered these things and entered into
[1:15:55] his glory?" In other words, the
[1:15:58] crucifixion should not have done
[1:16:00] anything to hinder their belief.
[1:16:03] If anything, the suffering and the
[1:16:05] slander and the crucifixion was actually
[1:16:07] proof of who he was. Amen. Let's bring
[1:16:11] that forward into our own day. I'm
[1:16:13] telling you today that the slander and
[1:16:15] the persecution and the trials and the
[1:16:17] wars and the evil, it doesn't hinder our
[1:16:19] belief. If anything, it doesn't change
[1:16:22] our expectations. It shouldn't make us
[1:16:24] worry and doubt, but it's vindication.
[1:16:27] This is the truth. He says, "Perilous
[1:16:30] time shall come and they're here.
[1:16:32] Scoffers shall arise and they're here."
[1:16:35] Men will say, "The Lord hath delayed his
[1:16:37] coming. There will be a great falling
[1:16:39] away." Yes, Lord. We're right on
[1:16:41] schedule.
[1:16:43] We're right here lining up with the
[1:16:45] scriptures exactly how it said it would
[1:16:47] be.
[1:16:50] But even the disciples after the
[1:16:52] resurrection, they're asking him, think
[1:16:54] about this. They've been with him.
[1:16:56] He's resurrected.
[1:16:58] They're gathered with him again.
[1:17:02] And they say, "Now, will you restore the
[1:17:04] kingdom?"
[1:17:06] They still don't know what's going on.
[1:17:09] Now, will you do what we thought you
[1:17:11] were going to do all along? Now, will
[1:17:13] you confirm our thinking?
[1:17:16] And he says in Acts one, "And being
[1:17:18] assembled together with them, he
[1:17:19] commanded them that they should not
[1:17:21] depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the
[1:17:23] promise of the Father, which saith he,
[1:17:25] you have heard of me. For John truly
[1:17:27] baptized with water, but you shall be
[1:17:29] baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[1:17:31] days hence he's laying out." This is
[1:17:33] what it's about. Your friends are being
[1:17:35] endued with power. Your friends have
[1:17:37] deity living on the inside of you. And
[1:17:39] watch them. Watch them. When they
[1:17:41] therefore were come together, they asked
[1:17:42] of him, saying, Lord, will thou at this
[1:17:44] time restore again the kingdom to
[1:17:45] Israel? He's pointing them here. And
[1:17:47] they're going, "What about this?
[1:17:50] What about this kingdom thing? What
[1:17:53] about the Romans?" And watch him gently.
[1:17:57] He said unto them, "It is not for you to
[1:17:58] know the times or the seasons which the
[1:18:00] Father have put in his own power." But
[1:18:02] now he brings them back instantly. But
[1:18:04] you shall receive power. He says, can we
[1:18:07] go back a couple verses?
[1:18:09] You shall receive power after the Holy
[1:18:11] Ghost has come upon you. You shall be
[1:18:12] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[1:18:14] in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[1:18:17] uttermost parts of the earth. Look at
[1:18:19] this account in Luke 24:46. And he said
[1:18:23] unto them, "Thus it is written, and thus
[1:18:25] it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise
[1:18:27] from the dead the third day, and that
[1:18:29] repentance and remission of sins should
[1:18:31] be preached in his name among the
[1:18:32] nations, beginning at Jerusalem, and you
[1:18:35] are witnesses of these things. And
[1:18:36] behold, I send the promise of my father
[1:18:39] upon you. But ter ye in the city of
[1:18:43] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:18:46] from on high."
[1:18:49] How long?
[1:18:52] Until.
[1:18:55] The word for you tonight, church, is
[1:18:57] until you trust this word. Until you
[1:19:01] have faith in this message until you
[1:19:04] hold on until your faith is being tried,
[1:19:07] but you believe until. Listen, he knows
[1:19:10] how long your trial is going to last. He
[1:19:12] knows how long the sickness is going to
[1:19:14] last. He knows how long this burden's
[1:19:16] going to last. He knows. And he's
[1:19:18] saying, "Just tar for the promise. Just
[1:19:21] tar till the victory comes. Just hold on
[1:19:24] until you're endued with power from on
[1:19:26] high. Don't move off of it tonight cuz
[1:19:29] it's been a while. Don't move off of it
[1:19:31] tonight because you've been waiting and
[1:19:32] waiting and don't budge because there's
[1:19:34] been this interval.
[1:19:37] Think about it. He sent you into the
[1:19:40] proving grounds until
[1:19:44] he expects us to have faith until and
[1:19:47] believe until and brother Brandham deals
[1:19:50] with this and how that maybe after a few
[1:19:53] days one said, you know, brothers, I
[1:19:54] think we got it.
[1:19:57] I I think we do. I mean, how long should
[1:19:59] we have to stay here? How long do we
[1:20:01] wait?
[1:20:03] And another one maybe said, "Yeah, you
[1:20:04] know what? I think about day three, I
[1:20:06] felt something.
[1:20:08] I Yep. It was day three. I definitely
[1:20:10] felt something.
[1:20:12] See, already expectations changing.
[1:20:16] He said, "Endued
[1:20:18] with power." Listen, I don't care what
[1:20:21] you felt. If your life isn't endued with
[1:20:23] power to overcome sin and live above
[1:20:25] sin, you need to go back until. You need
[1:20:28] to stay there until. I don't care if you
[1:20:30] jumped, shouted, danced, screamed, spoke
[1:20:32] in tongues. Hey, I support you in all
[1:20:33] your dancing and shouting. I'm for it.
[1:20:35] But if you don't get power and dude in
[1:20:37] your life, you didn't do nothing but
[1:20:39] some cardio.
[1:20:45] There's got to be power endued with
[1:20:48] power into your life. But Peter stands
[1:20:51] up and he says, "We ain't going
[1:20:52] nowhere." Says, "We're staying. Others
[1:20:55] can settle for less. Others can change
[1:20:58] their expectations, but I have a word
[1:21:00] from the Lord and I will not move until
[1:21:02] it is fulfilled." They waited and they
[1:21:05] waited and they waited and what
[1:21:07] happened? And
[1:21:09] suddenly, that doesn't mean it was
[1:21:12] quickly. They had been there 10 days,
[1:21:14] but it happened suddenly there came a
[1:21:16] sound from heaven as a rushing mighty
[1:21:18] wind. And it filled all the house where
[1:21:20] they were sitting. And there appeared
[1:21:22] under them clothe tongues like a fire,
[1:21:24] and it set upon each of them. And they
[1:21:26] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:21:28] began to speak with other tongues as the
[1:21:31] spirit gave them utterance. They terried
[1:21:34] and they received the fulfillment and it
[1:21:37] happened suddenly.
[1:21:40] Not quickly, not right off the bat.
[1:21:42] Maybe you've held on for healing tonight
[1:21:44] for a long time. Then suddenly you've
[1:21:47] battled depression for a long time, but
[1:21:49] suddenly you've looked for a prodal to
[1:21:51] return for a long time, but suddenly
[1:21:54] it's going to take place. How quickly it
[1:21:56] can happen in a moment, in a twinkling,
[1:21:59] one moment in his presence. And it can
[1:22:01] change all of those things. Suddenly
[1:22:03] it's changed. Suddenly you're delivered.
[1:22:05] Suddenly you're free. Suddenly your
[1:22:08] child walks through the back door.
[1:22:09] Suddenly. But you got to hold on until
[1:22:15] hold on until keep your expectations
[1:22:18] high. Hallelujah.
[1:22:20] Suddenly he can move on your situation.
[1:22:24] Stay with the promise. Stay with the
[1:22:26] message. Don't change what it means.
[1:22:30] Don't lower expectations.
[1:22:32] The nominal churches have done this for
[1:22:34] years. Change what it meant to be born
[1:22:36] again. Change people's expectations for
[1:22:39] the miraculous.
[1:22:41] They expect to to sin a little. They
[1:22:44] don't expect to overcome. They don't
[1:22:46] expect the gifts to operate. They don't
[1:22:49] expect the power of God in the service.
[1:22:51] I say tonight, evening like tabernacle,
[1:22:53] we are to expect it. We're to expect the
[1:22:56] power of God. We're to expect an
[1:22:59] overcoming life. We're to expect people
[1:23:01] filled with the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:23:03] expecting the miraculous to operate in
[1:23:05] this church. Hallelujah. We should
[1:23:07] gather every service with great
[1:23:09] expectations that God is going to move
[1:23:12] and not how some idea of what that
[1:23:15] means. Not the way I want him to move. I
[1:23:18] just want him to move.
[1:23:21] It may be shouting and rejoicing. It may
[1:23:23] be quiet and somber as he moves down
[1:23:25] deep into the hearts. We say sometimes,
[1:23:28] "Oh, that was a great service." What
[1:23:29] made it a great service? I'll tell you
[1:23:32] what makes it a great service is when
[1:23:34] God's word takes full effect in the
[1:23:36] hearts of men and women. If God's word
[1:23:38] has an effect and it burns out sin and
[1:23:41] it calls the sinner to repentance and
[1:23:43] hands are laid on the sick because the
[1:23:45] word says to and they're healed, that's
[1:23:47] a great service because the word had its
[1:23:50] way in the service.
[1:23:55] We need to let this place be a beacon to
[1:23:57] the world,
[1:24:00] a beacon to those going to Emmas,
[1:24:04] a beacon to those in doubt. We're not
[1:24:07] going to lower expectations.
[1:24:09] We're not going to back off the
[1:24:10] promises. Listen, he still heals
[1:24:13] tonight. He still delivers tonight.
[1:24:15] There will be a rapture. There will be a
[1:24:18] literal meeting in the air. The move is
[1:24:20] on for the bride of Jesus Christ. Hold
[1:24:23] fast tonight until until the fulfillment
[1:24:26] of all. He said, "I'll have a church
[1:24:29] without spot or wrinkle."
[1:24:33] I'm just going to be honest. I have a
[1:24:34] hard time seeing it
[1:24:36] because I can't see past my own spots
[1:24:38] and my own wrinkles.
[1:24:40] But he said it. It's up to him to
[1:24:43] fulfill it. So, I'm not lowering the
[1:24:45] expectations and saying, "Lord, just
[1:24:46] take us as we are, a mangled up body of
[1:24:49] believers." No, he said we would be in
[1:24:51] his image. He said we'd be without spot
[1:24:53] or wrinkle. I just say, "Lord, move in
[1:24:55] my life. Get me to the place where I
[1:24:57] don't hinder the fulfillment. Let my
[1:24:59] life be consecrated, sold out, and
[1:25:02] rapture ready. And I want the strength
[1:25:04] and the faith and the expectation to
[1:25:07] stand until you come again." Hallelujah.
[1:25:13] Hallelujah.
[1:25:15] He said he's going to prepare a place.
[1:25:18] He said he would come back. I say we got
[1:25:20] to be like Mary tonight and just say,
[1:25:22] "Lord, be it unto me. We can have it
[1:25:25] all. We can have every promise." And I
[1:25:29] want to receive it tonight however he
[1:25:31] sends it.
[1:25:32] We may not ever say to us, "You fools
[1:25:34] and slow of heart, why didn't you
[1:25:36] recognize,
[1:25:38] I warned you, it was there. I gave you
[1:25:40] everything you needed.
[1:25:43] And then after it's gone, they have to
[1:25:45] say, "But did not our hearts burn within
[1:25:47] us,
[1:25:49] but recognize in the moment,
[1:25:52] listen, the devil is going to war.
[1:25:54] Circumstance is going to war. Doubt is
[1:25:56] going to war.
[1:25:58] But when he returns, he will find
[1:26:01] faith."
[1:26:03] He will find faith because he has
[1:26:04] restored the faith to the people who
[1:26:07] have recognized he's here. Amen.
[1:26:11] Not just that he's coming, although he
[1:26:13] is. But brother Brandham, when the
[1:26:15] spirit told him to pick up his pen and
[1:26:17] write, he said the job of this messenger
[1:26:19] would be to forrunn and point to
[1:26:22] wordborn
[1:26:24] bride.
[1:26:26] He's here. When John for ran him, it's
[1:26:29] because he was here. When this messenger
[1:26:32] for him, it's because he was here. May
[1:26:35] we not miss it because we're like the
[1:26:36] Jews and it's going on and we're looking
[1:26:38] for it. It's happening right now. Amen.
[1:26:42] Evening light tabernacle is happening
[1:26:44] right now. The rapture has begun. The
[1:26:46] shout has gone forth. Jesus is in the
[1:26:49] flesh again in a bride body tonight. And
[1:26:52] any day now, he is going to suddenly
[1:26:55] suddenly snatch your away. I ask you, is
[1:26:58] your heart ready? Is your life ready?
[1:27:00] Are your expectations at that place? You
[1:27:02] ain't going to have time to get prayed
[1:27:04] up when he begins to sweep across the
[1:27:06] earth cuz it's going to happen suddenly.
[1:27:12] There's a bride on earth tonight.
[1:27:15] She still believes and she still
[1:27:16] expects. In Satan's Eden, we're still
[1:27:19] standing. Why? Time-tested faith.
[1:27:23] Time-tested material. It's a time-t
[1:27:26] tested bride. The prophet may have gone
[1:27:29] off the scene 60 years ago. It don't
[1:27:30] matter. Seals may have been been open 62
[1:27:34] years ago. It doesn't matter.
[1:27:36] That doesn't matter. His word's still
[1:27:38] true. He's still coming. We're time
[1:27:40] tested so Satan can buff it. Time can
[1:27:43] tear. Trials can come on every side. I
[1:27:46] have received a vindicated prophet. I
[1:27:49] have heard the call. I'm a part of the
[1:27:51] wrapping up of all things. I'm not
[1:27:54] lowering expectations. I'm getting ready
[1:27:56] tonight to go higher than I've ever been
[1:27:59] before. I'm getting ready to take my
[1:28:01] flight. My expectations are a body
[1:28:04] change. My expectations are a heavenly
[1:28:07] fight. My expectations are we're not
[1:28:09] leaving a hook behind. I'm not giving
[1:28:12] in. I'm not backing up. My expectations
[1:28:14] are higher than ever.
[1:28:18] Timeested faith. Hallelujah.
[1:28:22] We see him coming. We see him here. And
[1:28:26] we have been brought here to receive
[1:28:29] him. Will you stand together with me
[1:28:32] tonight as we read these final quotes?
[1:28:36] We're a people who knows what it's all
[1:28:38] about. That's not me. That's the prophet
[1:28:41] said that. He says, "But there was some
[1:28:45] people talking about Jesus riding in on
[1:28:47] the cult who was expecting him to
[1:28:50] arrive. They had believed him and they
[1:28:52] know that he kept his promises because
[1:28:54] it had been noised out that he was going
[1:28:56] to be there and the people were waiting
[1:28:59] for him believing that he would keep his
[1:29:00] word,
[1:29:02] expecting him to keep his word. And
[1:29:04] under that great charge of expectations,
[1:29:07] there was somebody that knew what it was
[1:29:09] all about. And so it is today in this
[1:29:12] time of frustration. Pay attention to
[1:29:14] this quote. You know what's been going
[1:29:16] on in the world. In this time of
[1:29:19] frustrations, nations against nations,
[1:29:21] our enemy coming over trying to make
[1:29:22] peace like it was at the time of Pearl
[1:29:24] Harbor with another enemy. And the
[1:29:26] people just don't know what to do. When
[1:29:28] they speak a billion-dollar missile
[1:29:30] programs and see who can make a race to
[1:29:32] the moon and other signs saying that it
[1:29:34] might set the whole universe of fire,
[1:29:36] war everywhere. Just at one moment, some
[1:29:38] fanatic could touch a little lever and
[1:29:40] blow the whole world up and everybody is
[1:29:42] at attention. But I'm so thankful
[1:29:46] there's somebody who knows what's going
[1:29:49] to happen. We know it's the coming of
[1:29:52] the Lord. He said these things would be
[1:29:54] just before his coming that this would
[1:29:56] be taking place. And it's like it was at
[1:29:58] Jerusalem that day. Some didn't know,
[1:30:00] but there was others who did know. And
[1:30:02] we can see them little groups, some over
[1:30:04] by the east gate, some by the west gate,
[1:30:06] some at different places. But after a
[1:30:08] while, we begin to see them all come
[1:30:10] together at the east side of the gate.
[1:30:12] That was a sign that something was going
[1:30:14] to happen. For when God's people begins
[1:30:17] to come together, something is fixing to
[1:30:22] take place. Church, I don't care how
[1:30:24] long things go on. I don't care if
[1:30:26] Israel and Iran make peace. I don't care
[1:30:29] who's president. I don't care what all
[1:30:31] else you still think needs to to to
[1:30:33] happen before he can come. I'm telling
[1:30:35] you that he will and is going to come
[1:30:39] suddenly.
[1:30:42] He's coming suddenly.
[1:30:44] May be a long time coming, but it's
[1:30:46] going to happen suddenly. He's going to
[1:30:48] show up. He's going to fulfill his word.
[1:30:51] How's it going to be, brother Aaron? I
[1:30:52] don't know.
[1:30:54] I just know it's going to be suddenly.
[1:30:57] What do I got to do, brother Aaron?
[1:31:00] How do I show God that I love him?
[1:31:06] And how shall I prove my love to him?
[1:31:09] by believing what he said and by
[1:31:13] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[1:31:16] trials that he and his wisdom allows to
[1:31:18] come to pass. What does that mean
[1:31:21] believing? You're trusting.
[1:31:24] You're expecting. You're living your
[1:31:26] life according to the word. Not I
[1:31:29] thought, I thought, I thought, but it's
[1:31:33] he said. He said, he said, he said.
[1:31:38] church. I have no idea how much longer
[1:31:40] we'll be here. I mean, the human
[1:31:43] eyes looking at it, knowing what we
[1:31:45] know. I honestly believe it could happen
[1:31:48] tomorrow.
[1:31:51] Could be a few months.
[1:31:53] But you know what?
[1:31:55] Could be years.
[1:31:58] I don't know.
[1:32:00] But what I do know is he's going to come
[1:32:02] suddenly.
[1:32:03] And he's going to come suddenly for some
[1:32:05] of us even before then.
[1:32:08] [Music]
[1:32:10] Be ready.
[1:32:12] Keep your expectations and your faith
[1:32:14] high. The devil's trying to rob our
[1:32:15] expectations. And I don't just mean for
[1:32:17] the rapture. He's trying to rob our
[1:32:19] expectations for our services. He's
[1:32:21] trying to rob our expectations for for
[1:32:23] how much overcoming we can do and make
[1:32:25] us think we got to sin a little. It's
[1:32:27] okay if this and it's okay with that. I
[1:32:29] say we reject that. We reject that in
[1:32:32] the name of Jesus. He has given the Holy
[1:32:33] Spirit in this day. It has been fully
[1:32:35] restored. With the fullness of the word
[1:32:37] comes the fullness of the Holy Spirit.
[1:32:38] Which means there is overcoming power
[1:32:40] for you to live above sin. There's
[1:32:42] overcoming power for you to cast Satan
[1:32:44] out. You don't have to bow to his lies.
[1:32:46] You don't have to bow to his depression.
[1:32:47] You don't have to give in. We don't have
[1:32:49] to have mundane, boring, dead, formal
[1:32:52] services. We can come and let the power
[1:32:53] of God move in this place. I'm not going
[1:32:55] to settle for that. I'm not going to
[1:32:57] back off our promises. My expectations
[1:33:00] are higher than ever that God's going to
[1:33:02] fill this place with his spirit. He's
[1:33:04] going to pour out time after time after
[1:33:07] time after time. And those who receive
[1:33:10] him are going to be given the power to
[1:33:12] be called the sons and daughters of God.
[1:33:15] He's coming suddenly. Be ready church.
[1:33:19] God bless you tonight in the name of the
[1:33:21] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:26] A move
[1:33:28] of God.
[1:33:30] A move
[1:33:32] of God.
[1:33:36] I'm expecting
[1:33:40] anticipating
[1:33:42] a move.
[1:33:45] Oh,
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:48] say I'm expecting
[1:33:52] I'm expecting
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:56] anticipating
[1:33:58] a move.
[1:34:02] Oh
[1:34:05] say I'm expecting
[1:34:08] I'm expecting
[1:34:12] anticipating
[1:34:14] a move
[1:34:16] of God.
[1:34:19] Oh, I'm expecting
[1:34:23] I'm expecting
[1:34:28] anticipating
[1:34:30] a move
[1:34:32] of God.
[1:34:34] A move
[1:34:36] of God.
[1:34:39] Surround
[1:34:41] me,

[1:36:31] Fill
[1:36:33] me.
[1:36:36] Oh yes, Father. Yes. Fill
[1:36:41] me,
[1:36:43] oh Lord.
[1:36:46] Just let your spirit
[1:36:50] fill.
[1:36:52] Oh, sing it again. Surround me, Lord.
[1:36:56] Surround
[1:36:58] me.
[1:37:00] Oh Lord,

[1:37:23] fill
[1:37:25] this place.
[1:37:29] And I
[1:37:32] want to be more like you,
[1:37:36] Jesus.
[1:37:38] I
[1:37:40] want to be more like you.
[1:37:46] I want to be a vessel you work through.
[1:37:51] I
[1:37:53] want to be more like you.
[1:37:59] Oh, I
[1:38:02] want to be more like you,
[1:38:06] Jesus.
[1:38:08] I
[1:38:10] want to be more like you.
[1:38:16] I want to be a vessel you work through.
[1:38:21] I
[1:38:23] want to be more like you.
[1:38:28] Say
[1:38:29] I
[1:38:31] I want to be more like you.
[1:38:35] Oh Jesus,
[1:38:38] I
[1:38:39] I want to be more like you.
[1:38:46] I want to be a vessel you work through.
[1:38:51] I want to be more like you.
[1:39:00] There is none
[1:39:03] like you.
[1:39:09] No one else can touch my heart like you
[1:39:14] do.
[1:39:18] I could search for all eternity
[1:39:22] long
[1:39:24] and find
[1:39:26] there is none like you.
[1:39:34] Oh, there is none like you.
[1:39:42] Oh, no one else can touch my heart like
[1:39:47] you do.
[1:39:51] And I could search for all eternity.
[1:39:57] Oh, I would find
[1:40:00] there is none like. Oh, say there's none
[1:40:04] like you.
[1:40:08] Oh, there is love.
[1:40:11] [Music]
[1:40:13] No one else can touch me.
[1:40:17] [Music]
[1:40:22] Oh, I can serve
[1:40:28] eternity long. Go and find there is
[1:40:34] none.
[1:40:36] I could search
[1:40:38] say
[1:40:41] I could search for all eternity.
[1:40:50] There's love.
[1:40:53] I could search for all
