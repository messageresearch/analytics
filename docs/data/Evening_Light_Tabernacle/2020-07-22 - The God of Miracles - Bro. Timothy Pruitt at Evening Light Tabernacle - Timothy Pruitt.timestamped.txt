[28:18] our bodies
[28:20] we ask it in jesus name amen
[28:24] let's turn to judges 6 and verse 7.
[28:37] amen judges 6 and verse 7
[28:41] and it came to pass when the children of
[28:44] israel cried unto the lord because of
[28:46] the midianites
[28:48] that the lord sent a prophet unto the
[28:50] children of israel
[28:51] which said unto them thus saith the lord
[28:54] god of israel
[28:55] i brought you up from egypt i brought
[28:58] you forth
[28:59] out of the house of bondage and i
[29:01] delivered you
[29:02] out of the hand of the egyptians and out
[29:05] of the hand of all that oppressed you
[29:07] and drove them out from before you and
[29:10] gave you their land
[29:12] and i said unto you and i said unto you
[29:14] i am the lord your god
[29:16] fear not the gods of the amorites in
[29:19] whose land you dwell
[29:20] but you have not obeyed my voice and
[29:23] there came an angel of the lord and set
[29:25] under
[29:26] an oak which was an oprah
[29:29] and pertained unto joash and his son
[29:32] gideon threshed wheat by the winepress
[29:35] and hid it from the midianites and the
[29:38] angel of the lord appeared unto him
[29:40] and said unto him the lord is with thee
[29:43] thou mighty man of valor and gideon said
[29:46] unto him o my lord
[29:47] if the lord be with us why then is all
[29:50] this befallen us
[29:52] and where be all his miracles which our
[29:55] fathers told of us saying did not the
[29:57] lord bring us
[29:58] up from egypt but now the lord hath
[30:01] forsaken us
[30:03] and delivered us into the hands of the
[30:05] midianites
[30:06] amen we'll let you be seated
[30:13] we spoke just a couple of sundays ago
[30:17] on the days of miracles are here like to
[30:20] speak to you on the god of
[30:22] miracles the god of miracles and the god
[30:25] of miracles
[30:26] and god being a miraculous god and a god
[30:29] who does miracles
[30:30] is all through the scripture and of
[30:32] course you couldn't touch this tonight
[30:35] as far as the vastness of all of all the
[30:37] things that are in the in the bible that
[30:39] we can pull from
[30:41] but you know looking at this as as we
[30:43] see a people that had
[30:45] walked away from god and and forgot that
[30:48] who god was and forgot
[30:50] what he had told them to not fear that
[30:53] when the things they begin to fear begin
[30:55] to come upon them but the word was sent
[30:57] to them by the prophet
[30:59] and it was spoke if you read it there as
[31:01] we read the prophets
[31:03] came unto the children of israel and his
[31:05] words were this
[31:06] thus saith the lord god of israel i
[31:08] brought you out from egypt i brought you
[31:11] out of the house of bondage i delivered
[31:13] you
[31:13] from the egyptians and now the hand of
[31:16] those that oppressed you
[31:17] and i drove them all out from before you
[31:19] and i gave you
[31:21] the land and i said unto you i am the
[31:23] lord your god
[31:24] fear not the gods of the amorites and so
[31:27] it's amazing that he began to
[31:29] immediately tell him
[31:30] who he was and to remind them of who he
[31:34] was
[31:34] and what who he was and what god had
[31:37] done
[31:38] for them in that moment of the of their
[31:40] time of life and
[31:42] because what who god was is who god
[31:45] is and so what god done
[31:48] is what god does and this is what he was
[31:51] trying to show them i did this there but
[31:53] i'm also
[31:54] the same god today don't forget who i am
[31:57] god was reminding them to not forget
[32:00] that he is the god
[32:01] of miracles he wanted the he wanted his
[32:04] people to know
[32:05] he works miracles because if we look at
[32:08] the miracles that god
[32:10] done in the in what he was talking about
[32:12] and delivered them
[32:13] out of egypt and and and out of out of
[32:16] the house of bondage my just
[32:18] how many miracles did the children of
[32:20] israel see
[32:22] time after time god moving on the scene
[32:24] and and god
[32:25] producing miracles it was a miracle of
[32:29] how that he would take a river system
[32:31] and turn it into blood it was a miracle
[32:34] that he could take the dust of the earth
[32:36] and turn it into gnats or
[32:37] or to bring frogs to be so thick as they
[32:40] were
[32:41] miracle after miracle sign after sign
[32:43] after sign
[32:44] and then he brings them out of egypt and
[32:47] then the angel of god
[32:48] and a pillar of fire a pillar of cloud
[32:52] and fire
[32:53] guarded them or stood between them and
[32:55] the egyptians and then
[32:56] a strong wind made a path for them to go
[32:59] through the red sea and walk across on
[33:01] dry land
[33:02] that was what i consider a miracle amen
[33:05] and then the same deliverance that
[33:07] brought
[33:07] they were brought amen the egyptians
[33:09] tried to follow them
[33:10] and their chariot wheels were made to
[33:12] come off and the army
[33:14] the whole army was drowned in the sea
[33:16] right there before their very eyes
[33:18] and this is what he's telling them don't
[33:20] forget what i'd done
[33:22] for you when i delivered you from egypt
[33:24] because what i was
[33:26] is what i am and what i've done
[33:29] is what i do amen bitter waters were
[33:31] made sweet and drinkable manna
[33:34] rained down from heaven as bread quail
[33:36] were sent to provide
[33:38] meat water came from a rock time after
[33:40] time and followed them through the
[33:42] wilderness
[33:43] amen moses would raise his hands and the
[33:45] israelites would
[33:46] prevail over amalek god would speak
[33:49] lift to ear they would hear his voice
[33:52] from the mountain at sinai
[33:54] the winds would once again bring quail
[33:56] down into their midst
[33:58] you know miriam's rebellion and leprosy
[34:01] and god coming on the scene and healing
[34:02] her
[34:03] and then you know the ground opening and
[34:05] swallowing korra and all those that were
[34:07] with him
[34:08] the budding of aaron's staff the water
[34:10] amen from the rock the bronze snake on a
[34:13] pole
[34:13] the crossing of the jordan river that
[34:16] was a lot of miracles they witnessed
[34:18] amen you know just today as me and
[34:20] sister ruth were reading the bible
[34:21] together
[34:22] reading to once again how they came
[34:24] across jordan in the flood stage and how
[34:27] he told the priest to go out and walk
[34:29] out and stand in the middle of the
[34:30] jordan
[34:31] and god roll back one one side went down
[34:34] and the water continued because you know
[34:36] the red sea was pretty much a steel body
[34:38] but now we're working with a flowing
[34:40] river as it would continue to flow and
[34:42] and imagine how that wants to look
[34:44] to the kings of the of and the people of
[34:46] that land that the scripture said their
[34:48] their hearts melted within them when
[34:50] they saw what god had done
[34:52] and god took that and he and he let the
[34:55] the one side just went completely dry
[34:57] and the other side walled up
[34:58] water all the way back to a city and a
[35:01] miracle that god would work on the scene
[35:04] and here
[35:04] he was trying to remind them again i
[35:07] still
[35:08] do that i'm still a worker of miracles
[35:11] i'm still
[35:12] can move in impossible situations in
[35:14] other words these
[35:15] midianites are not too much for me all
[35:18] god needed was someone that he could
[35:21] work through amen
[35:22] and so we would look and we were
[35:23] acquainted with how amen
[35:25] how what what what was going on the
[35:27] philistines and the midianites and the
[35:29] amorites
[35:30] all the different ones that would come
[35:32] in and steal the blessings
[35:33] of the children of israel and the fear
[35:36] that would become upon them
[35:38] but did you notice they could not do
[35:40] that until
[35:41] israel first fell away from god or they
[35:44] lost their faith in god or they
[35:46] they lost that what god had told him he
[35:48] said don't fear them because
[35:50] i'm greater than they are but they
[35:52] forgot about how great he was how
[35:54] quickly and
[35:55] you know you've seen this the precursor
[35:58] of their lives so pretty much
[36:00] as they would go down through the
[36:01] through the wilderness and and they just
[36:03] very quickly how
[36:05] for how quickly they would forget how he
[36:07] opened the red sea
[36:09] how quickly they would forget how he
[36:11] gave him victory here and
[36:12] how he opened this and he done this and
[36:14] he went and he fed him here and he gave
[36:16] him how quickly they forgot
[36:18] and sometimes we get in the middle of a
[36:20] battle we get in the middle of situation
[36:22] and how quickly we forget who he is and
[36:25] we forget what god can do he said see
[36:28] when you can remember he said see
[36:30] remember this the devil
[36:31] can't set a foot on you to hurt you
[36:36] he said until first you get away from
[36:38] god
[36:39] now that may not be sin that maybe it's
[36:41] forgetting who he is or
[36:43] letting your faith waver or falling away
[36:45] just for a moment
[36:46] amen and pulling back and forgetting who
[36:48] he is and getting away from god but you
[36:51] first must remember this
[36:53] he said check it when it happens he said
[36:55] when the devil comes in
[36:57] see if you're in the faith or not see if
[36:59] you're right with with god or not
[37:01] and if you are then remember the devil
[37:04] cannot harm you hallelujah why
[37:09] you are in christ and anyone that's born
[37:13] again is in christ that does not mean
[37:15] that sickness won't come against you but
[37:17] it cannot harm you
[37:18] spirits will still come against you but
[37:20] they cannot harm you
[37:22] things will come against you and your
[37:24] body and your and your spirit and try to
[37:26] attach themselves to you
[37:27] but if you're in christ they can not
[37:30] harm you
[37:31] hallelujah and this place you know a few
[37:35] few years before we could read how
[37:37] how the prophetess deborah and and and
[37:40] bayrack would come and
[37:42] endeavor would prophesy and bayrock
[37:44] bayrack the great army
[37:46] the great warrior would triumph over the
[37:48] enemy but
[37:49] soon as they would get out of that he
[37:50] said they would get into a little twist
[37:52] again and right back into the rut they
[37:55] went again
[37:56] he said if that isn't the picture of our
[37:58] church today
[37:59] he said as soon as it gets out of one
[38:01] twist it goes into another
[38:04] hello somebody this is what we've seen
[38:06] the message do it get out of one twist
[38:08] and go into another twist
[38:09] get out of one thing go into another he
[38:12] said but the time
[38:13] had come for action the time had come is
[38:17] the same now
[38:18] it is a time for action it is a time
[38:21] it's come that play in church
[38:23] has come to a halt
[38:26] hello somebody playing churches come to
[38:29] a hall

[38:32] get down to business with god
[38:34] and i trust that the same god will place
[38:37] us upon the heart of you tonight
[38:39] that in the time for his time for a halt
[38:42] to
[38:42] put play in church to quit playing
[38:44] religious quit playing righteousness
[38:47] and it's now time for action
[38:51] it's time to see god living in flesh
[38:54] it's time to see god's
[38:56] working as he did 2000 years ago
[38:59] not just an idea of theology and and be
[39:02] able to quote scriptures i better quote
[39:04] this the devil can quote scriptures
[39:05] the devil can quote quotes i'm talking
[39:07] about a life lived in front of the devil
[39:10] and when the devil comes you say not
[39:11] today satan
[39:13] no i'm a blood-bought son of god and
[39:16] this is not my voice
[39:18] you're hearing the voice of the creator
[39:20] you're hearing the voice of god speak
[39:22] back to you he knows he's heard it
[39:23] before
[39:25] but it's time to quit playing religious
[39:27] you know hey you know we live in a time
[39:28] that everybody's playing they're acting
[39:30] a lot of acting going on and
[39:32] and people have played and played the
[39:34] part of the message long enough
[39:38] sat on our own pews and played the part
[39:40] of the message played the part of
[39:41] religious play the part of righteousness
[39:44] and
[39:44] and playing along and he says but see
[39:47] when people
[39:48] god's people get in trouble god has sent
[39:50] them a prophet
[39:51] and it'll bring them back to the word
[39:53] again it's never a time that god's
[39:56] people ever got in trouble
[39:57] unless god sends them his word and his
[40:01] word
[40:01] is here for our deliverance once again
[40:05] hallelujah he said find out if it's a
[40:07] woman we said how do you know
[40:08] if it's the word tested according to the
[40:10] word then
[40:11] god's word becomes alive you say well
[40:14] you know
[40:15] i got we got this prophet in our church
[40:17] and we got this one as prophesied
[40:19] listen if it's a prophecy that's being
[40:21] prophesied and it don't come to pass you
[40:23] don't hear him
[40:25] if he's speaking words that don't happen
[40:27] or a life that can't be lived
[40:29] you don't listen to him but if that word
[40:32] has a life to back it up
[40:34] hallelujah a god called life to back it
[40:37] up that'll walk there and speak to the
[40:39] devil
[40:40] and cast him out and watch god move on
[40:43] the scene
[40:44] and watch god do the miraculous
[40:49] people want to call themselves prophets
[40:52] and yet they only get their prophecy
[40:53] right a few times
[40:55] and they got most of them wrong they
[40:57] prophesied this and they prophesy that
[40:59] and half the time or more is wrong well
[41:01] you're not you're a prophet all right
[41:03] it's called a false prophet
[41:06] but a true prophet of god will take you
[41:07] back to the word again
[41:10] you know get right in your place he'll
[41:11] get right right where you're living
[41:13] he'll get right down where the rubber
[41:14] meets the road
[41:15] and it don't always feel good and it all
[41:17] don't always i
[41:18] you know i you know it hurts
[41:21] but it's time to quit playing
[41:25] listen we're in a time that is time to
[41:27] quit playing
[41:31] you played long enough to come to church
[41:33] and you played long enough to have a
[41:34] certain dress code
[41:36] and you're playing and you tinker with
[41:37] things of the world and their dress code
[41:39] and you're right on the line it's time
[41:41] to quit playing
[41:43] it's time that we go in and we have a
[41:45] good house cleaning
[41:46] and we move all these things aside if we
[41:48] want to see god do the miraculous in our
[41:51] house
[41:51] get your house ready for the miraculous
[41:54] [Applause]
[41:56] amen if you want to see god do the
[41:58] miraculous in your own life
[42:00] get your life ready for the miraculous
[42:04] you don't come fill a dirty vessel
[42:09] amen god's people gets in trouble but he
[42:12] always sends them a prophet
[42:15] he always comes according to the word
[42:18] he said in every case he sends people a
[42:20] true servant
[42:21] a true prophet that will bring a true
[42:23] word of god a true word of god
[42:25] and the word of god is what delivers the
[42:27] people
[42:29] hallelujah now we can look back in the
[42:32] read there in 7th verse to the 10th
[42:34] verse
[42:34] and we find out that israel had turned
[42:37] away from god
[42:38] at the beginning of this chapter turned
[42:39] away from god and going back to the
[42:41] world again
[42:42] and out of nowhere came this prophet it
[42:44] don't even really give him a name
[42:46] i guess you know it wasn't it wasn't
[42:48] that wasn't the important part the
[42:49] important part
[42:50] was he spoke what god said amen he was
[42:54] anointed by god and he had a message on
[42:56] his heart
[42:57] and he called the people back to
[42:58] repentance to an
[43:00] understanding that their god was a god
[43:03] of might
[43:05] that their god was a god of deliverance
[43:08] that their god was a god of miracles
[43:12] and any true prophet will say the same
[43:14] thing today
[43:15] listen he's a god of miracles that
[43:17] snatched them out of the hands of the
[43:19] egyptians
[43:20] that opened up the red sea that failed
[43:22] have had them there in the wilderness
[43:24] a god of might that can take the land
[43:27] from somebody else and give it to them
[43:30] he's a god of might he's a god
[43:35] able yet more than able and these
[43:38] midianites and
[43:39] and amorites and so forth had come up to
[43:42] eat their land
[43:44] the enemy had challenged had set forth a
[43:46] challenge and this challenge must be met
[43:48] the armies couldn't meet it their
[43:50] priests couldn't meet it
[43:52] churches couldn't do it so the word of
[43:54] god came to meet the challenge
[43:58] amen he said the enemy may speak today
[44:01] and the enemy tries to say the days of
[44:03] miracles are passed
[44:04] the enemy tries to come and say there's
[44:06] no such a thing anymore as a true
[44:08] baptism the holy ghost
[44:10] it's only a motion it's only a work of
[44:12] the enemy has
[44:13] challenge and his challenge must be met
[44:22] there's only one way we can meet that
[44:23] challenge
[44:26] he said brother ryan said you don't meet
[44:27] him you know with it with
[44:29] with with your pl ds or llds or
[44:33] or being their trustee or deacon or a
[44:35] pastor
[44:36] no there's one requirement to meet this
[44:38] challenge
[44:39] wait in jerusalem until you're endued
[44:42] with power from on high
[44:45] that will meet the enemy's challenge
[44:50] hallelujah amen it ain't coming to this
[44:54] church going to meet the enemy's
[44:56] challenge
[44:57] it ain't listening to a certain amount
[44:58] of tapes that's going to meet the
[44:59] enemy's challenge or
[45:00] singing enough songs or do it it is
[45:03] being born again
[45:05] that is what's going to meet the enemy's
[45:06] challenge and once you're born again
[45:08] then church playing days are over with
[45:11] righteous playing days are over with
[45:15] hallelujah amen there'll be a power on
[45:18] the inside of dunamis
[45:20] a power on the inside that when you go
[45:22] out and you meet that devil
[45:24] he ain't got no right over you no more
[45:26] he can't come inside of you and take
[45:28] over you no more
[45:29] he can't take over your voice and your
[45:31] actions he can't take it over no more
[45:33] why there's somebody greater there
[45:37] hallelujah and when somebody's greater
[45:39] there the devil can't take over your
[45:41] dress no more
[45:43] he can't take over your hairdos no more
[45:45] and the way your actions no more
[45:47] he can't take over none of that no more
[45:49] he's lost his power
[45:51] that's the greatest miracle that could
[45:53] ever be done in your life
[45:56] it's the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:06] he didn't come with some man-made
[46:08] theology he come and said i am the lord
[46:11] that brought you out of egypt
[46:13] and showed my mighty hand and showed my
[46:15] power
[46:18] i am the god that did this saying i can
[46:20] imagine gideon listen to that prophet
[46:22] i've done all this yet you've not obeyed
[46:24] my voice and all this i've done it
[46:28] he said i want he said i want to tell
[46:30] you another thing that might encourage
[46:32] you
[46:33] immediately after that prophet's message
[46:36] the lord appeared on the scene
[46:40] hello somebody i want you to understand
[46:43] we've had a prophet visit our generation
[46:46] and the lord is on the scene
[46:50] hallelujah as soon as he gave his
[46:52] message the lord
[46:53] appeared and the lord came down and the
[46:56] message of the prophet
[46:57] amen as he spoke and sat under a tree
[47:00] all people had fallen away people had
[47:02] went into their isms
[47:04] but god had sent his prophet and the
[47:06] lord followed the prophet's
[47:09] and it was a message for deliverance oh
[47:12] hallelujah
[47:13] this is what this message is church it
[47:15] ain't a message of your rules and
[47:17] regulations and
[47:18] how to's and why not to it is a message
[47:21] for your deliverance
[47:23] it is a message for an exodus it is a
[47:25] message for getting you out of here
[47:27] it is a message for breaking off the
[47:29] chains of slavery
[47:32] not putting slavery on you breaking
[47:34] slavery off of you
[47:42] here we see though gideon scared
[47:47] out in the wine press thrashing out
[47:49] enough wheat
[47:50] before the philistines or midianites
[47:52] found him
[47:54] little grove had a little had ordered a
[47:56] little grub for the winter
[47:58] thrashing it out secretly so they
[48:00] wouldn't find him because
[48:01] they would come in like grasshoppers and
[48:03] take everything they had
[48:04] you know it's just the way the devil
[48:06] does
[48:08] get a little something started in the
[48:09] church and here the devil comes in and
[48:10] tries to take it all away
[48:13] tries to tear it all down listen he said
[48:15] see it comes in like grasshoppers
[48:17] taking away what had been given gideon
[48:19] being a
[48:20] scriptural man now listen how he puts
[48:22] this being a scriptural man
[48:24] when the angel of the lord appeared to
[48:26] him and he said the lord
[48:27] capital l o r d it was not an angel it
[48:30] was
[48:31] god a theophany in the form of god
[48:34] appear like it appeared to abraham and
[48:36] looked like a man
[48:37] acted like a man but it was something
[48:39] greater than a man
[48:41] and it came down to bring a message of
[48:44] deliverance
[48:46] and gideon asked the scripture because
[48:48] he was a scriptural man
[48:50] that kind of man that god comes to
[48:52] somebody who knows what he's talking
[48:54] about
[48:54] gideon said if god be with us if you're
[48:57] truly a messenger
[48:58] where are the miracles
[49:03] because he knew if he was god he was a
[49:06] god of miracles
[49:08] how far away us message people have
[49:10] gotten away from that
[49:12] we don't want to we don't accept these a
[49:14] god of miracles for some reason we
[49:16] we want to act like it's some other day
[49:17] past or some other day in the future
[49:19] listen it's today
[49:23] what he did is what he does
[49:26] what he was is what he is hallelujah if
[49:29] we can say it we're gonna
[49:31] we have to deny the scripture hebrews 13
[49:33] 8
[49:34] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[49:36] and forever
[49:37] to not believe god is a god of the
[49:39] miraculous
[49:40] right now that if he's a god of the
[49:42] miraculous what's wrong with me
[49:44] expecting him to be what he is
[49:47] [Music]
[49:54] he said because if you how can you
[49:56] expect god today to work
[49:58] among people this is a direct quote who
[50:01] doesn't even believe in miracles
[50:08] but he says it's a good way he said
[50:10] gideon had a good way to trust whether
[50:12] the messenger was right or not if he has
[50:15] a form of godliness
[50:17] he will deny the power to do those
[50:18] miracles but if he's a
[50:20] messenger from god he'll not only speak
[50:23] it
[50:24] he'll produce it hallelujah
[50:27] to show that the god that he talks about
[50:30] is with him
[50:31] and in him hallelujah
[50:34] listen how scriptural listen he said
[50:36] listen how scriptural
[50:38] gideon was and otherwise he said we
[50:41] understand that god is a great god of
[50:43] mighty workings
[50:44] he's a god of miracles and if he's for
[50:46] us if he's with us
[50:48] if he is the same yesterday today and
[50:49] forever where
[50:51] how can i see his miracles where can i
[50:54] see this god in action
[50:55] i want to see him in action
[50:59] and i believe that ought to be our
[51:01] desire every service every day of our
[51:03] lives
[51:04] god i want to see you in action and i
[51:07] believe we have seen him in action
[51:11] god moving on to miraculous and changing
[51:14] lives and changing the direction of
[51:16] someone
[51:16] changing things in a moment and
[51:18] twinkling of an eye he is the god of
[51:20] miraculous
[51:26] wherever a supernatural being is
[51:30] he will do supernatural signs
[51:33] because the supernatural is in him you
[51:36] can't get away from it
[51:38] how can you stand in the wind without
[51:41] the wind blowing
[51:44] how can you get in the water without
[51:45] being wet
[51:47] and when you get in the presence of god
[51:50] the supernatural
[51:51] is going to be there the supernatural
[51:55] signs the supernatural workings
[51:57] of a supernatural god if god's there the
[52:00] supernatural is present
[52:02] then all things are possible then the
[52:05] sick can be healed
[52:06] the death can be raised
[52:13] you know that's what they said about the
[52:14] disciples said they they they could they
[52:16] could see that they had been with jesus
[52:19] how because they was doing the works
[52:21] jesus did
[52:22] things were being produced out of them
[52:24] because the life jesus was
[52:26] was now living on the inside of them and
[52:29] the
[52:29] miraculous was following him signs and
[52:31] wonders follow them that believe
[52:33] it just happens that's the way it goes
[52:35] it's a word of god you can't do nothing
[52:36] about it devil
[52:39] hallelujah he said where is the working
[52:42] where's the miracles of god be with us
[52:45] oh hallelujah that's it where god is
[52:48] miracles are right here
[52:52] hallelujah how many miracles we got in
[52:53] the house today where god is
[52:56] miracles are where god is healing is
[53:00] where god is deliverance is where god is
[53:03] salvationist
[53:10] gideon didn't realize that the man
[53:11] sitting there was just a man all he
[53:14] knowed he was just a man
[53:15] that's all he could see was a man but he
[53:17] said if you're if god's with us
[53:19] then there's going to be miracles how
[53:22] scriptural that is
[53:24] for where the supernatural god is his
[53:26] sign
[53:27] will be with him where god is the sign
[53:30] of god is with god
[53:34] we know that if he is in his people they
[53:36] will do his signs
[53:39] hello somebody
[53:42] if he is in his people they will do his
[53:46] signs
[53:48] what is his signs they shall lay hands
[53:50] upon the sick and they shall recover
[53:52] they shall tread on serpents and shall
[53:54] not harm them
[53:58] what was the signs the dead were raised
[54:02] miracles so everywhere he went miracles
[54:04] took place
[54:06] and we get to this point and we say well
[54:07] we know we you know we're not going to
[54:09] major on that that's a minor well
[54:11] i want everything god has and quit
[54:14] making that an excuse for your lack of
[54:16] faith
[54:17] believe if he's here he can do what he
[54:20] said he would
[54:25] this is where gideon was if he's here
[54:28] then he's going to do what he said he
[54:29] would do
[54:30] that was the whole point of his question
[54:32] that he wasn't questioning if god could
[54:34] do it
[54:35] he's just asking if you're god then
[54:37] there has to be miracles
[54:43] this is what he was asking he said then
[54:45] where is his miracles if the
[54:46] supernatural god is here
[54:48] where is the supernatural works of god
[54:51] that could be easily said tonight he
[54:53] said amongst our churches
[54:55] where is the god that wants to live did
[54:57] he die
[55:02] ask that question did he die 50 years
[55:05] ago
[55:07] 60 years ago no people's faith got away
[55:10] from him
[55:14] and they got into theology and got into
[55:17] you know
[55:18] into intellectualism and learning and
[55:21] and got all puffed up
[55:22] and and couldn't hardly do nothing when
[55:24] it come to the spiritual works of god
[55:26] and to believe that anything god could
[55:28] do god will do
[55:32] i understand there's been all kind of
[55:33] people impersonate
[55:36] somebody said maybe brother tim the
[55:38] other day i i believe they ought to be
[55:40] impersonating us
[55:45] hello i believe as a church of god
[55:50] and as a people of god we ought to have
[55:52] something they want to impersonate
[55:55] that they see something real on the
[55:57] inside of that church they
[55:59] they see a life there and they see god
[56:01] moving on the scene they see
[56:03] god in action and people today don't
[56:06] want you to testify because they say
[56:08] well
[56:08] you're just puffing yourself up i'm not
[56:10] puffing myself up
[56:12] it wasn't me that done it
[56:14] [Music]
[56:15] i'm telling you who he is
[56:18] it was god that come in this house and
[56:20] healed a young woman of cancer
[56:22] it was god who come in this place and
[56:24] put hair back on a little girl
[56:26] it was god who come in the hospital room
[56:29] and gave my mom
[56:30] her life back
[56:33] and how dare you tell me i can't testify
[56:37] he is the god of the miraculous he is a
[56:40] god and what he did
[56:41] he will do
[56:44] and what he wants he still is today
[56:48] if he healed cancer 50 years ago then
[56:50] bob we ought to go ahead and believe him
[56:52] he'll do it again nothing too hard for
[56:58] this
[56:59] god
[57:05] i'm going to ask some people who who
[57:07] left and left you in charge
[57:09] tell us we can't testify we can't tell
[57:12] what god has done
[57:14] we can't lift up a god out of history
[57:18] to let a dying world know he's still god
[57:22] he's still the same yesterday today and
[57:24] forever
[57:26] let me tell you something you out there
[57:28] critics you get cancer one time you're
[57:30] gonna want this god
[57:35] people say well i ain't gonna believe in
[57:36] no miraculous as long as a doctor was
[57:38] involved
[57:39] that's a bunch of nonsense
[57:44] shows just how far your intellectual has
[57:46] taken you down
[57:49] here you say are you angry brother yeah
[57:51] i'm angry
[57:53] people there's a challenge out there but
[57:55] there's a people here to arise to the
[57:57] challenge
[57:58] and there's a god here to back it up
[58:05] he said he's the same he said did he die
[58:08] is he gone is he off on a trip somewhere
[58:13] no sir he's the same yesterday today and
[58:16] forever
[58:18] and if we say we're of god then let's
[58:21] see where
[58:22] god is let's see the signs of god
[58:29] if this tabernacle stands for god let's
[58:32] see
[58:32] god moving among us let's see souls
[58:35] being born into the kingdom of god
[58:38] let's see lives being straightened up
[58:40] let's see the sick being healed and the
[58:42] blind being brought back to sight
[58:43] the death here and again let's see his
[58:46] mighty works
[58:46] perform if god is in our midst
[58:53] if god is with his people and in his
[58:56] people
[58:57] that person can't help but do the same
[59:00] thing god did
[59:05] i know that choked some of them
[59:06] intellectuals out there but
[59:08] that was a quote let me read that again
[59:10] if god is with his people
[59:12] and in his people they cannot help
[59:16] but do the same thing that god did
[59:19] that's right because it's not the person
[59:22] anymore
[59:23] it's god living in a people
[59:27] oh hallelujah that's what jesus would
[59:29] say if you don't believe me believe the
[59:30] signs that i do
[59:33] they was told there would be a prophet
[59:35] like moses raised up
[59:36] and he would be a messiah and he said if
[59:38] you cannot do if
[59:39] i do not the works of my father then
[59:41] don't believe me i'm wrong
[59:42] but if i do the works of my father and
[59:44] you don't believe me then believe the
[59:46] works
[59:50] what does the works do they tell you who
[59:52] i am
[59:54] they testify me
[59:57] they're my witness not my credentials
[1:00:00] that i belong to a certain religion or
[1:00:03] i belong to a presbyterian pentecostal
[1:00:05] message
[1:00:08] i can show my fellowship card with the
[1:00:10] works that i do
[1:00:11] the signs of god the signs of messiah
[1:00:14] they are the ones that testify of him
[1:00:17] and jesus said he that believeth on me
[1:00:19] the works that i do
[1:00:20] shall he do also if god be for us where
[1:00:24] are the miracles
[1:00:25] if god be in us what's the matter with
[1:00:27] us then something's wrong
[1:00:29] somewhere yes jesus said if i if you can
[1:00:32] believe me what i say
[1:00:33] watch what testifies with me for they're
[1:00:36] the one that gives witness of me
[1:00:38] the lord your god said there'd be a
[1:00:39] prophet raise up and here i am but you
[1:00:42] don't believe me
[1:00:44] but believe the works and they could see
[1:00:47] him do the things only god could do
[1:00:49] and yet they could not believe
[1:00:55] that's the word of the blind man where
[1:00:56] he created the eyeballs that's one of my
[1:00:58] favorite
[1:00:59] moments where jesus moved in in a
[1:01:03] miraculous way
[1:01:05] the creator once again working in
[1:01:07] creation
[1:01:09] taking some mud and spitting on it and
[1:01:11] putting it in his eyeballs
[1:01:14] i wonder how many would have stayed in
[1:01:15] that church service
[1:01:19] we got a lunatic hello we got a lunatic
[1:01:21] spitting in some clay putting in some
[1:01:23] man's eyes
[1:01:24] he says go wash and he came back to see
[1:01:26] him
[1:01:28] and then begin to question him and and
[1:01:30] and come against him for testifying
[1:01:33] of what who are you to come against the
[1:01:36] blind man's testimony
[1:01:38] when he was the blind one but now you
[1:01:39] can see
[1:01:47] these are his parents and they're like
[1:01:49] well don't ask us ask him it happened to
[1:01:51] him
[1:01:53] and the man makes one of the most
[1:01:56] astounding statements that
[1:01:57] should have shook them to their roots
[1:01:59] and down into their very soul
[1:02:01] he said never before the world has ever
[1:02:03] been that a man been born blind been
[1:02:05] given his sight
[1:02:06] yet you don't know who he is
[1:02:11] 30 minutes ago i didn't even have
[1:02:13] eyeballs
[1:02:17] but yet now i got elbows and i can see
[1:02:20] you and i can see my family for the
[1:02:22] first time
[1:02:22] and you don't know who he is
[1:02:26] and we've seen the miraculous done in
[1:02:28] such a phenomenal
[1:02:29] form in this age that we're living in
[1:02:31] and people are casting it down and
[1:02:33] making fun of it
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:43] god have mercy on the hearts
[1:02:49] get in standing there oh
[1:02:52] if that big god that's with us i want to
[1:02:55] see the
[1:02:56] sign of god and he goes get an offer and
[1:02:59] he brings it there and he lays it before
[1:03:01] him and the angel said go i'll wait
[1:03:04] he said what was he doing he was testing
[1:03:06] it gideon come with some broth and bread
[1:03:09] with meat
[1:03:10] and the angel said now you understand by
[1:03:12] this this will prove it
[1:03:14] and he poured the ground the broth out
[1:03:16] on the ground for a drink off and he
[1:03:17] took the bread and meat
[1:03:18] and laid it on a rock where he was
[1:03:20] thrashing that and took a stick from his
[1:03:22] hand like an old man a stab
[1:03:24] and touched it and when he touched it
[1:03:26] the smoke went out and the sacrifice was
[1:03:28] consumed what was it he took him back to
[1:03:31] the scriptures to prove
[1:03:32] who he was hallelujah
[1:03:36] and he said if god still remains god if
[1:03:39] god is the same god
[1:03:41] he wasn't a days gone by you don't have
[1:03:43] to go up and shake hands with a preacher
[1:03:45] you don't have to go put your name on a
[1:03:46] book them things are alright nothing
[1:03:48] against them
[1:03:49] but of god big god lay yourself on the
[1:03:52] altar
[1:03:54] and see what he'll do with your
[1:03:56] sacrifice
[1:04:03] lord spoke to me very plainly said ask
[1:04:05] those young people ask them

[1:04:54] god of somebody else or a god of history
[1:04:56] but god wants to be your god
[1:05:07] he said well god's my god what not the
[1:05:08] god of the bible
[1:05:11] because if the god of the bible was your
[1:05:12] god then you would do what the god of
[1:05:14] the bible said
[1:05:17] then the miraculous would be worked in
[1:05:19] your life
[1:05:22] hallelujah

[1:05:52] happened
[1:05:53] and when that happens all the devils in
[1:05:56] hell
[1:05:57] couldn't make you do it again

[1:06:51] christ in you and now
[1:06:53] it's the hope of glory filled with the
[1:06:55] spirit and
[1:06:56] ready to meet him

[1:07:28] church why does pastors still smoke
[1:07:31] cigarettes

[1:07:37] the gift of prophecy
[1:07:39] why do they still desire deny it if god

[1:07:46] ghost is still the god
[1:07:48] the pentecostal claim why do they break
[1:07:50] down their walls and petition and fuss
[1:07:52] them
[1:07:52] and become born-again christians
[1:07:58] oh my they go through all kinds of
[1:08:00] sensations

[1:08:03] things but still have creeds and dogmas
[1:08:06] and fussing
[1:08:07] popularity contests devils of the world
[1:08:09] blind is from the real truth of god
[1:08:11] people fall blindly around it against
[1:08:13] some sensation
[1:08:14] and come right back up with an arrogant
[1:08:16] spirit indifferent fussy high tempered
[1:08:19] that's not the spirit of god still
[1:08:21] continue right on out of water but of
[1:08:24] god be god

[1:08:41] he says if the clouds are hanging over
[1:08:43] the sun
[1:08:45] that doesn't mean the sun is shining or
[1:08:48] isn't shining
[1:08:49] the sun is always shining
[1:08:52] the only thing that keeps it from
[1:08:54] shining on you
[1:08:56] is clouds
[1:08:59] and if you get rid of the clouds the sun
[1:09:02] will
[1:09:02] shine he said brother get away from your
[1:09:06] sin get away from your doubts

[1:09:32] he said but denominations and men's
[1:09:34] creeds

[1:09:38] and smother out the word of god
[1:09:40] say it's for another day miraculous for
[1:09:42] another day divine healings for the
[1:09:44] millennium

[1:13:19] take over
[1:13:22] all god was waiting on was one person to
[1:13:24] grab something and go to work
[1:13:26] and god was going to answer he showed it
[1:13:28] already many times all through the
[1:13:29] scripture

[1:15:46] how did it ever weather the storm god
[1:15:49] determined it would be so
[1:15:52] he determined this word would stand
[1:15:56] that's why he would have such faith he
[1:15:57] said heavens and earth may pass away but
[1:15:59] this word
[1:16:00] will never pass away hallelujah he says
[1:16:03] see you take the clouds away what

[1:16:33] you know this is gonna be my last time
[1:16:34] to go to church

[1:16:38] because you were declared to be here
[1:16:42] there was a word that was spoke about
[1:16:44] you and god is so
[1:16:45] sure that you won't fail and you will
[1:16:48] come to pass
[1:16:49] because it's not you that liveth it's he
[1:16:51] that liveth on the inside of you
[1:16:53] and the devil's trying to cloud you over
[1:16:55] and the devil's trying to put the
[1:16:57] pressure
[1:16:57] and the devil trying to put all kinds of
[1:16:59] things upon you but just keep moving it
[1:17:01] back

[1:17:04] still shining
[1:17:05] god is still working the miraculous and
[1:17:08] he'll work one for you
[1:17:19] if you could just brush the clouds back
[1:17:22] the sun's already there
[1:17:25] the sun remains the same and christ
[1:17:27] remains the same
[1:17:29] we move away from him sometimes but he
[1:17:32] remains
[1:17:33] the only thing you have to do is turn
[1:17:35] yourself back and face him
[1:17:38] and see what takes place face christ
[1:17:42] face his word and see what takes place
[1:17:46] it'll be no more one day you're saved
[1:17:48] the next day your backslid that one day
[1:17:50] you're up one day you now know
[1:17:51] it'll be something has taken place it
[1:17:54] won't be well i spoke in
[1:17:55] tongues i danced in the spirit i don't
[1:17:57] know something took place
[1:18:00] god came and he brought a stability in
[1:18:04] my life
[1:18:05] and he said when that happens you will
[1:18:07] never
[1:18:08] turn to darkness
[1:18:12] hallelujah you know
[1:18:19] god is wanting somebody in this age as
[1:18:21] he had in every age
[1:18:23] you can read it we ain't got time to go
[1:18:24] through and all of them
[1:18:26] but just go through the scriptures very
[1:18:28] quickly in your mind
[1:18:30] he just needed somebody that would act
[1:18:32] upon his word
[1:18:35] and then if he could get somebody to act
[1:18:37] upon the word
[1:18:38] the word would come to pass all he
[1:18:41] needed was nowhere to act
[1:18:43] upon build an ark it's going to rain
[1:18:46] and when noah began to build an ark and
[1:18:48] began to act upon it
[1:18:50] before he even seen god's miracle he
[1:18:53] never seen rain before
[1:18:54] he didn't even science didn't even
[1:18:56] couldn't even prove it was there
[1:18:58] nothing but he began to act upon the
[1:19:00] word of god
[1:19:01] and god is once again looking for a
[1:19:03] people to act upon it
[1:19:06] he said i don't feel like it well noah
[1:19:07] didn't always feel like hammering
[1:19:09] another nail in the ark
[1:19:11] he didn't get up every day feeling like
[1:19:13] building an ark but he just acted upon
[1:19:16] it
[1:19:16] he began moving one day at a time one
[1:19:19] day at a time
[1:19:20] another board here another board there
[1:19:22] another tree here another tree there
[1:19:24] one day at a time moving all the way
[1:19:26] down acting upon what god had spoke
[1:19:30] because he knew if god spoke it god
[1:19:32] would bring it to pass
[1:19:34] hallelujah and this is what he's looking
[1:19:36] for us in our day
[1:19:37] it's somebody to act upon it
[1:19:42] you don't always feel it
[1:19:46] you don't always feel like a miracle
[1:19:50] you don't always feel the miraculous
