[0:04] hello everyone we are the team ministry
[0:10] here at the evening light tabernacle and
[0:12] we're glad that you joined with us again
[0:14] today and we are going to be discussing
[0:18] again the Word of God and we would love
[0:22] for you to join with us for a while as
[0:24] we talk about the good things of the
[0:26] Lord we were speaking in our last
[0:29] session when we started referring to
[0:33] some of the questions that were asked in
[0:36] Matthew chapter 24 when shall these
[0:39] things be and what is the sign of your
[0:42] coming and the end of the world and so
[0:45] actually Jesus would answer those three
[0:49] questions in that chapter and so however
[0:54] you know as we're looking at the sign of
[0:57] is coming and the end of the world I
[1:00] think there is a key word that comes
[1:05] that goes with the coming of the Lord
[1:07] and it's something says watch don't you
[1:11] think that's key today to be have a
[1:13] readiness you know and Jesus wanted us
[1:17] to have a state of being watching and
[1:20] waiting and looking and anticipating for
[1:24] his return I think when you take that
[1:27] word watch then you go back to the Greek
[1:31] - it actually means to be village'll and
[1:34] it also means to be watchful and to keep
[1:36] awake so he's telling us you need to
[1:37] keep awake right this is not a watch
[1:39] that you watch one time but it's to be
[1:41] vigilant about watching watching for
[1:43] what is coming you know stay awake don't
[1:46] be drifted asleep and put to sleep in
[1:50] the slumber of Laodicea and the lukewarm
[1:51] is's here but to await to be watchful -
[1:54] to expect his coming if every I would
[1:59] see him at his coming why would he
[2:01] continually emphasize watch watch
[2:06] watch as we are discussing in our last
[2:08] session that people misunderstand the
[2:12] third coming and the second coming
[2:14] because in the third coming which is
[2:16] revelations 19 it says every eye will
[2:19] see him and and that the world would
[2:23] seem and there would be a cataclysmic
[2:25] event but many people place that at the
[2:28] second coming with planes fall now the
[2:30] skies and train wrecks and people and
[2:32] just utter chaos and turmoil but that
[2:35] ain't the case the second coming Jesus
[2:37] comes like a thief in the night
[2:39] and so his emphasis and the sign of his
[2:42] coming and the end time events is watch
[2:45] watch because there are going to be
[2:47] people that are gonna miss it right give
[2:49] strict attention to yes when you do that
[2:52] you're watching the scriptures and the
[2:55] pattern of the scriptures to see how
[2:57] he's coming and when he's expecting this
[3:00] calm so it's you constantly given the
[3:03] attention that is needed not just
[3:05] looking in the skies waiting for him to
[3:06] park the skies giving the attention here
[3:09] in the word to see where the word says
[3:12] he's coming in what forms and what times
[3:14] and what they ultimate coming which is
[3:16] when he comes back with as bright as we
[3:18] alluded to in a previous session yes I
[3:20] think this watch is speaking of more
[3:23] than just your to physical absolutely
[3:25] absolutely because you know your planes
[3:28] falling out of skies I mean yeah that's
[3:30] easy to see with these two eyes but
[3:31] there's some people that's been given
[3:33] eyes to see house for us see the
[3:35] promises of God and see the things of
[3:37] God and be able to pick up signs there
[3:39] it is just like they did you know when
[3:41] Jesus came the first time there was some
[3:43] people there that could pick it up and
[3:45] say hey that's that's the handsomest
[3:47] size this one just as they've won the
[3:49] Jews when you see these things happening
[3:51] if you're on the rooftop go not you know
[3:54] don't go back down there were people in
[3:55] those days that could see because they
[3:57] were watching for those things to come
[3:59] to pass right and I believe that we
[4:02] enter in a generation where the signs of
[4:03] his coming are everywhere the signs yes
[4:05] relation or everywhere and yet people
[4:07] are going along not seeing it because
[4:09] they're not watching through the eyes of
[4:11] the Scriptures the Pharisees came to
[4:13] Jesus and said show us a sign
[4:16] and Jesus said you can tell the sign of
[4:19] fair weather coming or storm coming you
[4:22] can you can judge by the signs of the
[4:24] sky
[4:25] he said what you can't tell the signs of
[4:27] the day that they were living they were
[4:29] missing it altogether and I believe
[4:31] that's exactly the watching is looking
[4:34] for the sign of his appearing the signs
[4:36] of his coming the endtime conditions and
[4:38] the things that he told us to look for
[4:40] you know and it's amazing how many
[4:43] people want to try to say they got a
[4:45] certain date what's gonna happen at a
[4:47] certain time certain months certain day
[4:49] I mean what do you say to that well you
[4:51] know there's been a lot of mistakes that
[4:54] have been made even Billy Graham back in
[4:56] the 50s made a statement I believe the
[4:59] Lord will come this year and of course
[5:01] he learned not to make those type of
[5:03] predictions and I think you know we
[5:06] cannot look back and see many many
[5:08] others who gathered in the houses or
[5:10] underground places or this or quit their
[5:14] jobs and then looking for the coming of
[5:16] the Lord
[5:17] I think I think though we can know big
[5:21] exactly because Jesus said it's in the
[5:25] hour you think not yea the Son of man
[5:27] coming so I you know so we know exactly
[5:31] when you come it'll be when many people
[5:33] aren't looking at expect so but you know
[5:36] that's the answer to those who have set
[5:39] dates because we cannot know the day or
[5:42] the hour I think that is part of the
[5:46] actually the Seventh Seal were in that
[5:49] silence that is spoke of that God holds
[5:53] some things silent and that is one thing
[5:55] that he keeps silent is the exact time
[5:59] of his coming however I do believe that
[6:03] we can see signs of his coming and that
[6:07] and we can see by those signs that we're
[6:10] in the season of his claim and
[6:13] this is true when in for the Bible said
[6:17] wouldn't when you see the fig tree
[6:20] putting forth this bud but it says and
[6:22] all the other trees so when you see a
[6:25] time of restoration so we see Israel the
[6:28] victory that is putting forth her buds
[6:30] and we see many many other things that's
[6:33] coming into restoration that we know
[6:36] that we're in the season of the coming
[6:39] of the Lord so we're in that day an hour
[6:42] and then we can look back and see
[6:44] patterns in the scriptures like the days
[6:47] of Noah the days of Sodom therefore we
[6:50] can look at different types and we can
[6:52] talk about those as you if you would
[6:55] like let's jump back just for a second
[6:58] though just to kind of clarify it says
[7:00] an hour that you think not so sour that
[7:02] what are they thinking if they're not
[7:04] looking for his appearing far as two
[7:06] masses because we're talking about the
[7:08] masses is gonna be it was not gonna have
[7:09] a see Christ because they had they don't
[7:11] have the love for his appearing and for
[7:13] they gonna miss his type in the
[7:15] scriptures misses appearing in
[7:16] description so what would you say would
[7:18] be the thinking of man when it says an
[7:20] hour that you think not with so many
[7:22] professing Christians are saying they're
[7:24] looking for his coming well I feel like
[7:28] that that that people are involved in
[7:32] religion and you know perhaps the the
[7:37] trappings of of the society of the
[7:40] church rather than making really ready
[7:44] for the coming of the Lord and so
[7:46] they're unprepared you see the the
[7:48] brightness to be as one adorned for her
[7:51] husband she is ready for the wedding
[7:53] she's ready for the marries she's
[7:56] prepared for the coming of the Lord and
[7:58] so much like the Pharisees and Sadducees
[7:59] of their day they were so concerned with
[8:01] their programs and their agenda and when
[8:05] they're very massaged that their I mean
[8:07] Jesus Christ Himself the Son of God was
[8:10] right there in flesh and they didn't
[8:11] even know who he was yeah you know the
[8:13] the Sadducees were too interested in
[8:16] holding on to their power right the
[8:17] priesthood and you know their favor with
[8:21] the Roman
[8:22] and so on and rather than looking for
[8:25] the Messiah and searching the Scriptures
[8:27] and and to they had made the traditions
[8:33] out of this and so and so their
[8:36] traditions actually would make the Word
[8:38] of God to them of none effect you feel
[8:40] like that may be a stumbling block in
[8:42] this hour that we're living in with the
[8:44] systems around us and they're pushing
[8:46] their agenda or pushing their programs
[8:49] and what they can do for the family
[8:51] versus what the work can do for the
[8:53] family what an absolutely another thing
[8:55] is they've made it we reuse the term
[8:57] easy believe ISM to where there's no
[9:00] life that has to go with this profession
[9:02] so it's just once they profess okay
[9:04] Jesus is my Savior there's nothing to
[9:07] back that up or follow that up and they
[9:09] just go about the cares of everyday life
[9:11] and because they're not seeking a closer
[9:13] walk because they're not watching
[9:15] because they've been taught that's all
[9:17] you have to do yeah and so they're very
[9:19] teachings or traditions have led them to
[9:22] a state to where they're not prepared
[9:23] for the coming of the Lord
[9:24] hence the hour you think not because
[9:26] they're not really looking for it and I
[9:30] think today the majority of Christians
[9:33] day they may give some type of agreement
[9:38] yeah that Jesus is coming soon or
[9:41] whatever but really they're not looking
[9:43] for his coming they're not living like
[9:45] they're longing for his coming right
[9:47] also the Hauer like we've been talking
[9:50] about how're they think not I mean
[9:51] they're thinking it's gonna be planes
[9:53] crashing right gonna be train yeah going
[9:56] down Brooks blowing open that's the hour
[9:59] they're looking for right but he's gonna
[10:01] come when they don't come looking for
[10:02] him that's exactly yeah well I think if
[10:04] we go back to Matthew chapter 25 that we
[10:08] were speaking about in our past session
[10:10] or there's a wise virgin then the
[10:12] foolish virgin yeah well you know both
[10:15] them had professions yeah they all had
[10:17] they all had lamps they they all were
[10:22] waiting they were all looking for the
[10:24] bridegroom but the wise had oil in their
[10:30] vessels with their lamps yes so one had
[10:34] through baptism of the holy spirit while
[10:37] the other just had professions of faith
[10:39] yeah in all were virgins so they lived a
[10:43] high moral order yeah but in the Bible a
[10:45] woman always types at the church
[10:49] the the female the there's a scripture
[10:52] in 2nd Corinthians 11:2 Paul says I'm
[10:54] jealous over you with a godly jealousy
[10:56] for I've espoused you to one husband
[10:59] that I may present you a chaste virgin
[11:00] to Christ and and there's a another
[11:05] scripture that says that this is a great
[11:07] mystery concerning Christ in his church
[11:09] as as a woman marries a man and that man
[11:13] is her head so Christ marries the church
[11:16] so these these five are these 10 virgins
[11:20] representing women it's it's
[11:23] representing the church and then there's
[11:26] two groups there's two classes in here
[11:28] just as you described there are five
[11:31] that had oil in their lamps there were
[11:33] five that didn't have oil and their
[11:36] vessels their vessels typing the heart
[11:39] the receiving of God the place where the
[11:43] Holy Spirit would be filled and so there
[11:46] was a group that missed the rapture yeah
[11:49] and Jesus is carrying on now in Matthew
[11:52] 25 Matthew 24 he's saying watch watch
[11:56] watch and then he in Matthew 25 he
[11:58] follows that warning with this parable
[12:01] showing that there would actually be two
[12:04] classes within what is called the church
[12:07] right one group that would go and one
[12:10] group that would be left behind in
[12:12] weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth or
[12:14] otherwise the tribulation Great
[12:17] Tribulation that word virgin there means
[12:19] a woman of marriageable or a marriage
[12:22] above main so they're looking for to be
[12:24] exposed yes fine decent two different
[12:28] sections of ladies are virgins willing
[12:32] and ready to be married but one has what
[12:35] it's taken prepared herself to be
[12:36] married the other one has not so let's
[12:41] come back to this and and
[12:44] I have a question will will the Bride of
[12:47] Christ go through the tribulation
[12:51] absolutely not though there's a lot of
[12:54] confusion on the subject because people
[12:58] have different standpoints ministers
[13:00] would disagree and many are confused
[13:03] about the events there was a a man by
[13:08] the name of Bohannon mr. Bohannon once
[13:10] that talked to a minister and he said
[13:12] something a little sacrilegious he said
[13:15] John must have ate a red-pepper dinner
[13:18] that night when he when he wrote the
[13:20] book of Revelation which was very
[13:21] sacrilegious to speak against the Word
[13:24] of God like that the Minister rebuked
[13:26] him and said you know you ought to fear
[13:29] the Lord does talk like that he goes I
[13:30] just can't understand it he said I
[13:32] brought it to my preacher and he can't
[13:34] understand it he said there's the
[13:37] 144,000 and he was thinking that the
[13:39] hundred and forty-four thousand was the
[13:41] bride and he was getting it all mixed up
[13:43] standing on Mount Zion and what he
[13:45] failed to see was that the hundred and
[13:48] forty-four thousand are the Jews and
[13:51] that there is the the bride who already
[13:54] went in the rapture and then the remnant
[13:56] of the woman's seed that was left behind
[13:58] in the Tribulation Period so if we don't
[14:01] get the symbols of the book of
[14:04] Revelation right and the prophecies
[14:06] right then we got a cow up in a tree
[14:08] picking grass we've got the picture of
[14:10] redemption completely messed up
[14:12] altogether but but if we properly and
[14:16] rightfully divide the word of truth then
[14:19] we can see exactly every part has its
[14:22] place and that there is there is a group
[14:25] that is leaving before the tribulation
[14:27] the bride will not go through the
[14:29] tribulation period and we can talk about
[14:32] why it won't go through the tribulation
[14:34] period there is a group that is going
[14:37] through the tribulation period and then
[14:40] there's a hundred and forty-four
[14:41] thousand the elect the Bride of Christ
[14:45] is the elect of God that escapes the
[14:48] tribulation and she will judge the earth
[14:50] Paul said no you know that the Saints
[14:53] will judge the earth
[14:55] the Book of Daniel we see the Ancient of
[14:57] Days and he sets the Thrones down and
[15:00] the books are open and tens thousands
[15:03] times thousands ministered to him and
[15:05] then ten thousands times thousands stand
[15:08] before him the bride is not the one
[15:11] standing before you right the bride is
[15:13] sitting in the throne with him judging
[15:15] the nation but there there is also two
[15:18] resurrections right as a first
[15:21] resurrection in a second resurrection
[15:22] which we can discuss mm-hmm well and of
[15:26] course you know the the bride does not
[15:28] go through the tribulation is because
[15:30] she has already been judged in Christ's
[15:32] right because he would present himself a
[15:35] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[15:39] such thing but one that is holy and
[15:41] without blemish yes so because of that
[15:44] then we do not go through the judgment
[15:48] of the tribulation I think this is typed
[15:52] also with Enoch and Noah you have Enoch
[15:57] who walked with God it was not yes no we
[16:01] had the first we had the first not an
[16:03] astronaut in space but it was not yeah
[16:06] and that was Enoch yes and then it was
[16:08] not because he you know God took him so
[16:12] he was raptured but then we have the
[16:15] Noah who was the type of the tribulation
[16:19] Saints especially the Jewish remnant who
[16:23] actually go through the tribulation over
[16:26] into the Millennium so you have one goes
[16:30] up and one goes through yes so you have
[16:33] to watch your types in the scripture yes
[16:35] because it is actually prophecy and of
[16:38] what really will happen in the end time
[16:41] how how could the bride go to the
[16:45] judgment when she has already been
[16:49] judged like you just said Jesus made
[16:52] this comment be perfect is my father in
[16:55] heaven is perfect
[16:56] now that was not a figure of speech
[16:59] right and obviously there is a road to
[17:03] perfection or he wouldn't have told us
[17:05] to be perfect
[17:07] and so how can a man be perfect yeah
[17:09] that's a pretty tall tall that was a
[17:12] tall order and not just a perfect in the
[17:14] eyes of man but as the Father in heaven
[17:17] is perfect yeah this is a tall order
[17:19] there's only one way we could stand in
[17:22] that kind of perfection and the Bible
[17:25] said Jesus became our sin that we might
[17:29] become the righteousness of God the only
[17:33] way we could ever stand in the
[17:35] perfection of God is to stand in Christ
[17:38] that means the judgments that fell upon
[17:41] Christ does not belong to us because he
[17:44] took them and that's why he said by one
[17:47] sacrifice he is sanctified and perfected
[17:50] forever them that are sanctified rather
[17:52] by one sacrifice he's perfected forever
[17:55] them that are sanctified so it is a
[17:58] blood offering it is the offering a
[18:00] Christ that brings us to the state of
[18:02] perfection and the Bible said if any man
[18:05] be in Christ he's a new creature old
[18:07] things are passed away all things are
[18:09] made new she shall not come into the
[18:11] condemnation but she is passed from
[18:13] death unto life amen what a wonderful
[18:16] promise that is to us that we can look
[18:18] forward to a rapture a people who have
[18:21] been made spotless by the blood of the
[18:24] Lamb and will be taken out before the
[18:27] judgment we want to talk about this more
[18:29] when we come back to our next session
[18:31] god bless you folks for listening today
[18:34] and we look forward to again to see you
[18:37] in the near future thank you for joining
