[22:54] plenty of failures but One Moment In His
[22:57] presence can take care of all those
[22:59] things
[23:00] amen I I believe that we may just call
[23:04] this a youth Service as it were tonight
[23:07] but I've learned to not take any
[23:09] opportunity in his presence for granted
[23:12] you've made the effort and you've come
[23:15] so put everything you've got into it
[23:18] put everything you've got into it and
[23:20] recognize that this is an opportunity to
[23:23] draw closer to him this is an
[23:25] opportunity at eternal life that these
[23:27] aren't just gathering for the sake of
[23:30] gathering
[23:31] but that our God wants to speak to you
[23:34] for a little bit tonight and I I believe
[23:36] he will if you have your Bibles with you
[23:38] we want to turn to the book of Acts the
[23:40] fourth chapter and it may be a little
[23:42] different I was talking with brother
[23:44] Timothy in the back and I and I wasn't
[23:46] looking a certain way but then in my
[23:48] studies I came across a certain thing
[23:50] which led me down a certain path and
[23:52] then I was like well we're just going to
[23:53] go down all these paths and and get it
[23:55] done
[23:56] um so it may there may be a transition
[23:59] where it seems as if we we shift gears
[24:01] and that is that is the case
[24:03] with this and I just want to be real
[24:05] with you tonight let's just uh shake off
[24:07] the awkward feelings and just you know
[24:10] these are the same people that we gather
[24:11] with every Sunday there's the same
[24:13] people that we fellowship with at youth
[24:15] Gatherings these are the same people so
[24:17] we can just relax and be ourselves and
[24:19] talk genuinely tonight and just ask the
[24:21] Lord to come and have his way uh acts 4
[24:24] 32
[24:26] says in the multitude of them that
[24:28] believed were of one heart and of one
[24:32] soul
[24:33] neither said any of them
[24:36] that alt of the things which he
[24:38] possessed was his own but they had all
[24:40] things in common and with great power
[24:43] gave the apostles witness of the
[24:45] resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great
[24:47] grace was upon them all
[24:49] neither was there any among them that
[24:51] lacked for as many as were possessors of
[24:54] lands and houses sold them and brought
[24:56] the prices of the things that were sold
[24:58] and laid them down at the apostles feet
[25:01] and distribution was made unto every man
[25:04] according as he had need
[25:06] and Joseph that's also translated Joseph
[25:09] who by the apostles was surname Barnabas
[25:13] which is being interpreted the son of
[25:15] consolation a levite and of the country
[25:18] of Cyprus having land sold it and
[25:22] brought the money and laid it at the
[25:24] apostles feet amen
[25:27] let's talk to the Lord real quick Lord
[25:29] Jesus
[25:32] Lord in this moment I just asked you to
[25:34] come take control of me Lord settle my
[25:36] nerves Lord you see the things that laid
[25:38] him before us Lord the seriousness of
[25:40] them
[25:40] I just pray that you had helped me to
[25:42] deliver Lord exactly the way it was
[25:44] given Lord I pray right now that you
[25:46] would help each one of these young
[25:47] people to push through and enter in Lord
[25:49] and recognize their need of you Lord in
[25:52] the in the day that they're living in
[25:53] Lord each one of us each day in our own
[25:57] personal lives need more of you father
[25:59] Lord I just pray that you'll help us to
[26:01] recognize that and just to press in Lord
[26:03] for there's more of you that is
[26:04] available to us tonight Lord I pray that
[26:07] you take control now bless the reading
[26:08] of your word Lord and just take control
[26:10] of this vessel in Jesus name we pray
[26:12] amen amen you may have your seats
[26:15] tonight
[26:18] foreign
[26:20] right here in chapter four of Acts we're
[26:23] getting a look into the early church
[26:25] there at Jerusalem in Chapter 2 we have
[26:29] just seen the The Upper Room experience
[26:31] we've just come through that that
[26:33] portion of history as it were we see 120
[26:36] there filled with the baptism of the
[26:39] Holy Ghost on that exact same day we see
[26:42] 3 000 that are added to the kingdom as
[26:45] Peter stands up and begins to preach and
[26:47] says they were pricked in their hearts
[26:49] so there's 120 filled with the Holy
[26:51] Ghost and then that same day three
[26:53] thousand are added to the kingdom early
[26:55] on in chapter four we see 5 000 who
[26:58] believe and are and are added to the
[27:00] kingdom there are amazing things taken
[27:03] place here in the early days of that
[27:06] first church in the book of Acts Jesus
[27:09] is being preached by the apostles and
[27:12] many are believing and the gospel is
[27:14] spreading like wildfire it was an
[27:17] amazing time to be a part of the of the
[27:20] church and to be a part of this movement
[27:22] resurrection power is being manifested
[27:25] amongst the Believers it's being
[27:27] demonstrated in a mighty way and and
[27:30] healings are taking place and there's
[27:31] deliverances taking place there are
[27:34] Mighty prayer lines that are happening
[27:36] in one place brother Brownell makes the
[27:38] statement he says the prayer lines were
[27:40] so big that they ended up just laying
[27:42] the sick people out in the street and
[27:44] the scripture says they line the streets
[27:46] with the sick and with The Afflicted it
[27:48] says that sick folks and Afflicted folks
[27:51] and people with unclean spirits were
[27:53] being brought to the apostles and every
[27:56] one of them were being healed and every
[27:58] one of them were being delivered it's a
[28:01] it's a wonderful time as we're coming up
[28:03] to even this scripture reading that we
[28:05] just read in in chapter four in chapter
[28:07] 3 we've just seen the lame man at the
[28:10] gate called beautiful and he has just
[28:12] been healed
[28:13] and they come up to him and he's a
[28:16] beggar and he has need of something he
[28:18] just doesn't recognize that there's more
[28:20] available to him than what he's even
[28:21] willing to ask for how many times do we
[28:24] in a church service sit there and not
[28:26] realize there's more Force available
[28:28] than what we're even asking for maybe
[28:31] we're looking just for some rejoicing or
[28:33] for a shout or I hope this special goes
[28:36] good and I hope the preacher preaches
[28:38] good but there's a lot more available to
[28:40] you tonight than maybe you even realize
[28:43] when you came in the door and that's the
[28:45] situation that the beggar finds himself
[28:47] in he's wanting money he's wanting
[28:49] something temporary he's wanting
[28:51] something from them that might buy his
[28:52] next meal that might pay a bill he's
[28:55] wanting something but there's much more
[28:56] available to him than what he realizes
[28:59] in that moment and he's sitting there
[29:01] and he looks at him and his eyes fall
[29:03] upon him and then maybe he sticks his
[29:04] cup up or whatever it is that he has and
[29:07] Peter says to him Silver and Gold Have I
[29:10] None but what I have I give unto thee I
[29:15] wonder how many of us tonight are in a
[29:17] situation that we can give somebody
[29:20] Jesus
[29:21] how many of us are in a condition
[29:23] tonight that we can actually offer them
[29:27] Jesus because we have Jesus to give
[29:31] you know if you don't have Jesus you
[29:33] can't give Jesus you might can tell
[29:35] somebody about Jesus you might can tell
[29:38] them about a Doctrine but if you don't
[29:41] have Jesus in your heart if you don't
[29:43] have the Holy Ghost for yourself you
[29:45] can't give somebody Jesus
[29:48] notice he didn't begin to teach him a
[29:50] Doctrine about the resurrection
[29:52] notice he didn't he didn't begin to
[29:55] explain why the man's current belief
[29:57] system in the Jewish religion was wrong
[29:59] and he didn't launch into a sermon about
[30:01] the revelation of the godhead
[30:04] this isn't how Peter responded to him
[30:06] but Peter has just come from an upper
[30:09] room experience Peter has just come from
[30:11] a place where Jesus the one he used to
[30:14] walk with the one that used to talk to
[30:16] him he used to travel with and
[30:18] fellowship with where that one has now
[30:20] come to live on the inside of Peter and
[30:23] he is in a position to not just tell
[30:25] this man about Jesus he's in a position
[30:27] to give this man Jesus he's in a
[30:30] position to pass on what it is that's
[30:32] been given to him that's the place we
[30:35] got to get to to where the one that
[30:37] we've heard about the one we've talked
[30:38] about the one that's been preached to us
[30:40] becomes so real on the inside of us that
[30:43] it's something that we can give to other
[30:44] people it's something we can share with
[30:47] them Beyond a correct Doctrine Beyond we
[30:50] got this lined up and this lined up but
[30:52] there is a living God there is a real
[30:54] God there is a Deliverance for you there
[30:56] is a healing for you there is a real
[30:58] Jesus and you can share him because you
[31:01] yourself possess him
[31:04] that very one was now living on the
[31:06] inside of Peter
[31:08] pardon me while I looked for some water
[31:21] and because of that he could share Jesus
[31:25] it's got to be more than stories to us
[31:27] tonight young people
[31:29] it's got to be more than we live
[31:31] different we have a different lifestyle
[31:33] we have correct Doctrine
[31:35] it's got to be more than that to you
[31:37] this is a Dying World that you're living
[31:39] in
[31:40] this is a hungry world that you're
[31:42] living in this is a thirsty world that
[31:45] we're living in and listen it's good to
[31:48] tell somebody about the message
[31:50] it's good to tell somebody that there's
[31:52] a living God but can we demonstrate a
[31:55] living God to them because a living God
[31:57] is living on the inside of us can you do
[32:00] more than tell them can you demonstrate
[32:03] it two of the world you know before this
[32:06] moment before the upper room Peter was a
[32:08] coward
[32:09] Peter was afraid of what he believed
[32:12] before this Peter would deny what it is
[32:14] that he believed but now because of the
[32:17] upper room experience there's a boldness
[32:19] on the inside of him there's a courage
[32:21] on the inside of him we see him over in
[32:24] chapter five and he's actually he's
[32:25] leaving and he's actually rejoicing
[32:27] because he's been beaten and scourged
[32:30] and he's rejoicing that that he's been
[32:32] found worthy to suffer shame for Jesus
[32:35] the very thing he ran from the very
[32:37] thing he was afraid of the very thing he
[32:40] couldn't stand and take the shame he
[32:42] couldn't stand and take the criticism
[32:43] and now a little bit later we see he's
[32:45] rejoicing because of this because it's
[32:48] not Peter anymore it's not Peter trying
[32:51] to overcome anymore this is a new guy
[32:53] this is a new person it's now Christ
[32:56] Living on the inside of him it's not
[32:59] just stories anymore but there's
[33:01] somebody living the life through him
[33:04] listen if you haven't been to the upper
[33:06] room yet you got to get there if you
[33:09] haven't had your own Upper Room
[33:10] experience you have to have it it'll
[33:12] change everything about the way you live
[33:14] about the way you talk about the
[33:16] struggles you have it won't be a
[33:18] struggle anymore it won't be hard to
[33:20] give things up anymore it won't be hard
[33:22] for you to come to church and worship
[33:24] God anymore or put down your filthy
[33:27] movies and your filthy music and the
[33:28] things that you struggle to lay down it
[33:31] won't be anymore because it won't be you
[33:32] doing it but Jesus Christ on the inside
[33:35] of you will overcome those things in
[33:38] your life
[33:39] when you have your own Upper Room the
[33:41] devil has no Authority in your life
[33:43] anymore
[33:45] that Upper Room experience is a game
[33:48] changer
[33:49] it changes everything about the
[33:51] situations and the way you deal with
[33:53] them and how you struggle or don't
[33:54] struggle with the things of the world
[33:56] anymore
[33:59] you know the book of Acts is
[34:01] it's such an incredible read
[34:04] I encourage you to go and read it and if
[34:06] you haven't and if you have read it
[34:08] again
[34:09] because we preach that we're part of
[34:12] another book of Acts
[34:14] we preach that a repeat of the book of
[34:17] Acts and yet many times we don't know
[34:19] what all's in the book of Acts
[34:21] but if you're going to repeat something
[34:23] and you're going to be something and
[34:24] brother Branham would say that that's
[34:26] the mold that's the model that's the
[34:28] pattern then we ought to know what's in
[34:29] there
[34:30] we ought to know what's in there and I
[34:32] encourage you to get into it and as I
[34:35] was reading through in chapter four
[34:36] there was something here that jumped out
[34:38] to me
[34:40] as I was looking at this in verse 32
[34:42] where we started
[34:45] it says and the multitude of them that
[34:48] believed
[34:49] were of one heart
[34:52] and of one soul
[34:55] now here's where we're just going to
[34:56] talk real for a little while to our
[34:58] youth group
[35:00] I began to look through and I went back
[35:02] to Acts 2 and it says they were all in
[35:05] one Accord
[35:07] it says they had singleness of heart
[35:11] chapter 5 verse 12 they were all in one
[35:14] Accord just before it begins to tell all
[35:17] about all the healings and all the
[35:20] deliverances
[35:22] and I began to see a pattern that when
[35:24] God moved and when great things happened
[35:26] and when people were healed and when
[35:27] these things would pour out they were
[35:29] always in one mind
[35:31] one Accord
[35:32] singleness of heart singleness of mind
[35:35] it even said in that one place of one
[35:37] soul
[35:39] this is kind of hard to Fathom for a
[35:42] group of human beings
[35:45] because I
[35:46] I understand that you don't have to read
[35:48] too much further you get over into
[35:49] chapter seven and Beyond and you do
[35:51] begin to see some of the humanity and
[35:54] you do begin to see some of the
[35:56] disagreements amongst the Believers but
[35:58] early on in the book of Acts this is
[36:00] this is a theme that they have the same
[36:03] goal they have the same mindset they're
[36:06] striving for the same thing
[36:09] and what happens when we have the same
[36:11] goals and when our goals are the same
[36:13] then what we do is we don't focus on our
[36:16] differences
[36:18] when our goals are the same and when our
[36:20] focus is the same we're not noticing
[36:22] every little thing about people around
[36:24] us that we may not like or we like this
[36:27] about this and then we don't like this
[36:28] and this one gets on my nerves you're
[36:31] not focused on the same goals
[36:33] your vision has become clouded by
[36:36] Humanity instead of getting your eyes on
[36:39] the goal those little things and those
[36:42] differences are no longer your focus
[36:44] when everyone is focused on the same
[36:46] thing and I began to think about our
[36:47] youth group
[36:49] and not in a negative way I begin to
[36:51] think about how incredible our youth
[36:54] group really is
[36:55] how awesome it is that we have this
[36:57] group of young people
[37:00] and I thought about how the devil would
[37:02] love to get in
[37:05] how the devil would love to get in
[37:07] amongst this youth group and began to
[37:09] call strife and begin to cause Petty
[37:12] differences and begin to cause us to not
[37:14] be able to let go of this little thing
[37:16] that we took as a slight or this little
[37:18] thing was said or I wasn't invited to
[37:21] this
[37:22] and begin to allow strife and things to
[37:24] build up in our life
[37:28] how the devil would love to come in and
[37:30] cause division amongst friends
[37:33] cause some to feel that they have no
[37:36] friends
[37:37] cause us to draw up tight and not let
[37:39] others into our group
[37:41] or to cause some little disagreement or
[37:44] some little personality conflict to come
[37:46] between what should be strong
[37:48] relationships
[37:51] Now understand I'm not even saying these
[37:54] things from the standpoint of this is
[37:56] what's going on I'm saying these things
[37:57] from the standpoint of don't let these
[37:59] things happen
[38:00] don't allow these things to begin to
[38:03] creep into our lives and to allow
[38:05] Division and things to push
[38:08] to some degree these are all natural
[38:10] things that you're going to deal with in
[38:12] life whether it's at work
[38:15] whether it's at school
[38:17] whether it's within your own family
[38:19] whether it's I don't want to go to the
[38:21] family reunion because I don't like ants
[38:24] so and so
[38:25] let's be honest
[38:27] these are all real things brother Aaron
[38:30] ain't walking around just loving
[38:31] everybody
[38:33] just trying to get it out there that I'm
[38:35] not putting this off on you I understand
[38:38] I get it we don't just want to be best
[38:40] friends with everybody in the world
[38:43] or let's bring it down with everybody in
[38:45] our church
[38:49] can we be honest
[38:51] we're not always going to be best
[38:52] friends with everybody that's not how
[38:55] life works I keep looking over here like
[38:57] there's somebody sitting there but there
[38:58] ain't
[39:02] that's just not how things work these
[39:05] are real things that you're going to
[39:06] deal with I get that
[39:08] but the devil has a real interest in
[39:11] working more amongst churches
[39:14] specifically amongst youth to cause
[39:16] bickering to cause infighting to cause
[39:19] trouble
[39:21] I've seen entire families turn against
[39:23] each other because a kid in this family
[39:24] and a kid in this family have issues
[39:27] families that used to be best friends
[39:29] families that were super close but
[39:31] because of infighting amongst the youth
[39:33] turn against one another and then the
[39:35] youth has to choose sides and then the
[39:37] church has to choose sides
[39:39] and then oh but you didn't hear the
[39:41] whole story oh girl you don't even know
[39:43] what I heard about it
[39:46] dude listen I was there I saw it next
[39:48] thing you know everybody saw it
[39:52] these are real things hey 15 years
[39:54] Middle School I get it saw it every
[39:57] single day
[39:58] so I know how these things can come in
[40:00] oh yeah but I heard and then the church
[40:03] begins to choose sides and it's all over
[40:06] something that the devil would like to
[40:07] do to come in to tear apart and at the
[40:10] root of it it's usually
[40:12] nothing
[40:14] but what happens in the course of the
[40:16] whole situation is it causes all of us
[40:18] to get our eyes off of our same common
[40:21] goal get our eyes off of our same common
[40:24] enemy we begin to forget that we're in a
[40:27] battle and that your brother and your
[40:29] sister is not will not will never be
[40:31] your enemy we have but one enemy is the
[40:34] devil and we have but one goal and it's
[40:36] a Rapture it's the change of our bodies
[40:38] but you can't get there until you have
[40:40] your own Upper Room experience and once
[40:43] you get that and you get full of the
[40:45] Holy Ghost and you get focused on the
[40:47] Holy Ghost and then your concern becomes
[40:49] seeing your friends get the holy ghost
[40:51] seeing the others in the youth group get
[40:53] the holy ghost seeing your family on
[40:55] fire with the Holy Ghost when your goal
[40:57] becomes the Holy Ghost those other
[40:59] things fall away from you
[41:01] those other things are no longer your
[41:03] focus
[41:04] and I realize that we're human
[41:07] and where there are humans there will
[41:10] always be differences
[41:12] where there are humans there will always
[41:14] be times of not seeing eye to eye
[41:17] the reality is in a group this big
[41:21] we're not all going to be best friends
[41:28] those are just facts
[41:31] however what I see here in the early
[41:33] church
[41:34] is that their common goal was their
[41:38] focus
[41:40] in other words their differences were no
[41:42] longer their focus the fact that this
[41:45] one just really annoyed Peter isn't
[41:47] listed in the book of Acts
[41:49] don't tell me people didn't annoy Peter
[41:52] he strikes me as somebody that was
[41:54] easily annoyed
[41:57] but it's not recorded there in the book
[41:59] of Acts
[42:00] oh this one just really got on Andrew's
[42:03] nerves
[42:06] I know right it happens but it's not
[42:10] recorded because it wasn't there Focus
[42:12] you don't read anywhere where yesterday
[42:15] on Facebook juicy well they couldn't
[42:16] have posted that but
[42:18] let's bring it tired yesterday on
[42:20] Facebook you see what so-and-so posted
[42:23] and then you spend so much time talking
[42:25] about the person that posted something
[42:27] stupid on Facebook that you're no better
[42:28] than they are
[42:32] listen when you talk about the people
[42:34] doing the gossiping you're a gossiper
[42:42] it's true stuff
[42:44] it's real talk
[42:47] these things they were able to lay aside
[42:49] because they had one Focus Jesus
[42:53] Jesus was their focus they'd been in the
[42:56] upper room they received the Holy Spirit
[42:57] and they wanted others to receive the
[43:00] same Holy Spirit that's all they cared
[43:02] about their focus was on the holy ghost
[43:04] that is being poured out in the early
[43:06] church and not just that they could have
[43:08] more of it and they wanted it but their
[43:10] focus was how can I get others to it how
[43:13] can I spread this gospel how can I show
[43:15] someone how can it be demonstrated we
[43:17] want the world to know he's risen he's
[43:19] resurrected he is a living God and that
[43:23] was their focus the fact that this one
[43:25] was too dramatic and this one over here
[43:28] was too loud that wasn't their focus
[43:31] the fact that this one well that one she
[43:33] just likes to act so grown up
[43:35] well that's just because you're so
[43:37] immature
[43:38] so of course I seemed growing up to you
[43:41] that wasn't their focus
[43:44] and see the thing is we have to stop and
[43:46] realize raise your hand in here if
[43:48] you're 13.
[43:50] I know I got one I got two
[43:53] raise your hand in here if you're
[43:56] you're 21 or older
[44:01] age difference in our youth group
[44:04] we go from 13
[44:07] to well you don't ever really get kicked
[44:09] out
[44:13] you got a big age group
[44:15] you're going to have all kind of
[44:16] differences
[44:17] there's going to be things that get on
[44:19] your nerves but your focus is I want
[44:21] them to get Jesus
[44:23] I want to get them to the Holy Ghost I
[44:25] want to pray through with them at the
[44:26] altar I want to be there for them when
[44:28] they need somebody to talk to this is
[44:30] the youth group this is who we are this
[44:33] is what we are laying aside our
[44:35] differences laying aside the fact maybe
[44:37] we don't hang out all through the week
[44:38] but when the opportunity comes I'll be
[44:40] there for you when the opportunity comes
[44:42] I'll pray with you I'll pray for you I
[44:45] want to see you get the same thing I got
[44:47] and that is their focus they laid aside
[44:50] these things so that the common goal
[44:52] could be reached
[44:54] I'm gonna say it again we're not all
[44:56] gonna be best friends
[45:00] we're not all going to be invited to
[45:02] every event we're not all going to be
[45:03] invited to every birthday
[45:05] I don't need to be invited to your house
[45:09] let's bring it down to what I'm really
[45:11] saying you invite who you want to spend
[45:14] the night with you that ain't what this
[45:15] is about
[45:16] you invite who you want to your birthday
[45:18] party I do
[45:22] yeah
[45:23] no yep nope yep no
[45:27] it's being honest
[45:29] that's not what this is about
[45:31] you have who you won't go shopping with
[45:34] you
[45:35] please don't ask me I don't like
[45:36] shopping
[45:38] but you get my point
[45:40] we all do those things
[45:42] I'm not asking you to not have your
[45:44] circle of friends that's natural
[45:47] but when we are at church
[45:51] come on now with me or when we're at a
[45:53] youth meeting or when everyone gets
[45:55] together to play volleyball or whatever
[45:57] the case may be
[45:59] listen that's not the time to be
[46:02] cliquish
[46:03] that's not the time to gather up in the
[46:05] corner with your little group of friends
[46:07] that's not the time to go stand over
[46:09] here with your little group of friends
[46:10] that's not the time to be excluding
[46:12] people
[46:13] it's not the time to make someone feel
[46:15] awkward and unwanted
[46:20] here now I'm not trying to control your
[46:23] life at home that's not what this is
[46:24] about but here this is the time that we
[46:27] are all best friends
[46:30] we have gathered for a common cause and
[46:32] a common purpose to let each other know
[46:34] we're not alone and we're standing
[46:36] together and we're fighting together and
[46:38] we have one common cause we have one
[46:42] goal when we get here that's how we
[46:44] treat each other
[46:47] this is the time in these few hours in
[46:50] the gym or here in the church where we
[46:52] move beyond our personal likes we move
[46:56] beyond our funny feelings about this
[46:58] person or our funny feelings about that
[47:00] person which we all have
[47:07] but we moved beyond that for a few hours
[47:09] and we hug the neck of somebody that
[47:12] maybe we don't usually hug
[47:14] or we go out of our way to say something
[47:16] kind to someone that we don't usually
[47:18] speak to
[47:21] these times these moments is when
[47:24] everyone should know I am loved
[47:27] I am wanted
[47:29] I am a part
[47:34] I'm not trying to be funny I can't
[47:36] necessarily
[47:37] help it what you do on Tuesday
[47:42] or Thursday
[47:43] I'm not telling you to invite the youth
[47:45] group over for a sleepover
[47:48] I know wouldn't work
[47:50] I'm not trying to control your friend
[47:52] group
[47:53] I'm saying when we're together
[47:55] as the evening like Tabernacle youth
[47:58] every one is apart everyone is our
[48:01] friend everyone is on the same side
[48:03] everyone should have the same goal
[48:05] everyone should feel wanted everyone
[48:07] should feel loved everyone should feel
[48:10] like they are apart
[48:13] one thing I've seen for years in the
[48:15] school system and how easy it is for
[48:17] someone to fall through the cracks
[48:19] to be forgotten about reach out to that
[48:22] person
[48:24] let them feel noticed or cared about
[48:26] even if it's just for a little bit
[48:29] we all have that group that we're close
[48:31] to me too
[48:34] I have my group of friends we all have
[48:37] friend groups that's fine we're not
[48:38] looking to break those up but when we
[48:41] come together
[48:42] let's be together
[48:46] one heart as it says there in the book
[48:48] of Acts One Soul
[48:51] one goal
[48:54] yeah brother Aaron our group is so
[48:56] varied in age and different families
[48:58] different ideas different backgrounds
[49:00] it's easy you know it's hard to hang out
[49:03] with that person and it's hard it's hard
[49:05] for this and listen I want to read
[49:07] something that they wrote about that
[49:08] first church it says they were all of
[49:10] one heart they were all of one's Soul
[49:13] though there were many very many of
[49:16] different ages tempers and conditions in
[49:19] the world who perhaps before they
[49:21] believed were perfect strangers to one
[49:23] another yet when they met in Christ
[49:27] when they met in Christ they were as
[49:29] intimately acquainted as if they had
[49:31] known one another for many years perhaps
[49:34] they had been of different sex among the
[49:36] Jews before their conversion or had had
[49:38] discords upon civil accounts but now
[49:41] these were all forgotten laid aside and
[49:44] they were unanimous in the Faith of
[49:46] Christ and being all joined to the Lord
[49:48] they were joined to one another in Holy
[49:52] Love
[49:53] they had become so dedicated to the
[49:56] cause of Christ
[49:58] that all those other things were set
[50:00] aside
[50:03] and now as we begin to move from this
[50:05] point
[50:06] because we're staying in the same
[50:08] scripture
[50:09] but there's going to be a little bit of
[50:10] Shifting Gears here
[50:13] they became so dedicated to the cause of
[50:15] Christ that they begin to sell off their
[50:17] goods
[50:20] they began to sell off their homes they
[50:22] begin to sell off their lands and they
[50:24] began to give the money to the apostles
[50:26] for the purpose that the that the cause
[50:28] of Christ might go forward that the
[50:31] gospel might be preached that those in
[50:33] need might might be taken care of
[50:36] they begin to sell their houses and
[50:38] brother Brown said God would use this in
[50:40] a mighty way because when persecution
[50:42] came they didn't even have a house to go
[50:43] back to so because of that they had to
[50:46] run from place to place to place to
[50:48] place spreading the gospel everywhere
[50:50] that they went
[50:52] they gave everything they had
[50:56] they gave all for Jesus Christ
[51:00] they were so taken up with the hope of
[51:02] an inheritance in another world that
[51:05] they cared little for the things of this
[51:07] world
[51:08] their focus was on things of another
[51:11] world now here we are young people and
[51:13] here's where I want to get focused in
[51:15] they were so focused on the next life
[51:17] that giving up things in this life was
[51:20] very easy for them
[51:23] but brother Aaron I'm struggling to give
[51:25] this up it's because your focus isn't on
[51:28] the next life yet
[51:30] brother Aaron I'm struggling with this
[51:32] type of music or I'm struggling with
[51:33] this issue or I'm struggling with this
[51:35] lust your focus isn't on the next life
[51:37] your focus is too much on this life your
[51:41] focus is on a temporary life when your
[51:43] focus gets on that and it gets on that
[51:45] reward and it gets on eternity it's easy
[51:48] to give things up here it's easy to lay
[51:51] things down here
[51:53] well I'm just struggling to give these
[51:55] things up
[51:56] it's because your focus isn't on the
[51:58] right life yet
[51:59] your focus is on this life you're still
[52:02] seeing the pleasure of sin in this life
[52:05] your focus hasn't shifted yet
[52:08] there in our scripture reading we see a
[52:10] man named Barnabas
[52:12] whose sole Focus was on the Holy Ghost
[52:16] his Focus was on getting others to the
[52:18] Holy Ghost so he sold his land he laid
[52:21] the money at the apostles feet
[52:24] Barnabas would become a very renowned
[52:27] man in the early church
[52:30] a man looked up to not because he sought
[52:33] it but because he was a man that lived
[52:35] what he preached he was a man that had a
[52:38] testimony he was a man that didn't just
[52:40] tell people about the Lord Jesus but he
[52:42] demonstrated it and even became a man
[52:44] that was renowned he was an example he
[52:47] was one to follow after he gave
[52:50] everything for the cause he became a
[52:52] colleague of Paul and traveled and
[52:54] ministered the the apostles they
[52:56] respected him he had titles such as son
[53:00] of Prophecy son of exhortation son of
[53:03] consolation he was one known to walk in
[53:06] and live in and be full of the Holy
[53:08] Ghost
[53:09] we see him all throughout the Book of
[53:11] Acts here's one example Acts chapter 11
[53:14] verse 22
[53:17] then Tidings of these things came unto
[53:19] the ears of the church which was in
[53:21] Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas
[53:23] that he should go as far as Antioch who
[53:26] when he came and had seen the grace of
[53:28] God was glad and exhorted them all that
[53:32] with purpose of heart they would cleave
[53:34] unto the Lord for he was a good man and
[53:37] full of the Holy Ghost and of faith and
[53:39] much people were added unto the Lord
[53:42] we see these Works in barnabas's life we
[53:46] see his rewards we see a fruitful
[53:49] Ministry coming out of his life but the
[53:51] first thing we saw with Barnabas was in
[53:54] our scripture reading before we saw the
[53:57] rewards and before we saw his big name
[53:59] and this big Ministry and in full of the
[54:01] Holy Ghost and going around doing these
[54:03] things we saw that he gave all
[54:06] we saw that he gave everything and he
[54:08] laid it down that's the First Act we see
[54:11] in barnabas's life it's not a prayer
[54:13] meeting it's not Healing The Sick it's
[54:15] not the power of God father it's born of
[54:17] his coming and given everything he had
[54:25] now would be a good time to tell you
[54:27] what we're going to preach on
[54:30] since we're about halfway through
[54:34] pretending
[54:35] you gave all
[54:39] pretending you gave all
[54:43] Barnabas didn't have to pretend
[54:45] he laid everything he had down at the
[54:48] feet of the Apostles
[54:50] and listen with Barnabas we're talking
[54:51] about money
[54:53] Barnabas was giving money from selling a
[54:56] piece of land
[54:57] but that's not what I'm talking about
[54:58] with you here today today we're talking
[55:01] about being willing to die out to sin
[55:03] giving up the things of the world giving
[55:05] up your own personal Ambitions
[55:07] surrendering all that you are to him not
[55:10] holding back a little bit for yourself
[55:12] but everything you have I'm going to
[55:14] come and I'm going to lay it down at the
[55:15] feet of Jesus that you might receive a
[55:18] greater reward that you might receive
[55:20] the greatest reward and that is eternal
[55:22] life that you might receive the baptism
[55:24] of the Holy Ghost I hadn't got the Holy
[55:26] Ghost Yet brother Aaron have you given
[55:28] him everything have you laid everything
[55:30] down have you turned your back on
[55:33] everything of the world in all the
[55:35] pleasures is there anything you're
[55:36] holding back
[55:37] Barnabas didn't
[55:39] he laid everything down
[55:43] you have to lay it all down tonight you
[55:45] can't play games young people and expect
[55:47] to make it
[55:49] you can't pretend and expect to make it
[55:53] you can't hang out with those that
[55:55] aren't sold out and claim you are sold
[55:58] out
[55:59] you can't do it
[56:01] oh I'm just trying to influence my
[56:03] friends that is a lie that is not truth
[56:09] it got real quiet
[56:11] if you hang out with people not sold out
[56:14] it's because you're not sold out
[56:17] fact
[56:23] supposed to shun them no nobody said
[56:24] anything about shunning anybody
[56:26] I literally just spent 30 minutes
[56:28] explaining to you how you're supposed to
[56:29] be one same heartbeat Same Soul
[56:32] but there's time and there's place
[56:36] there's plenty of opportunity to show
[56:38] that person Your Love without running
[56:40] all over town with them by yourself
[56:44] foreign
[56:47] thank you
[56:48] as truth anyhow
[56:52] you must be willing to lay those things
[56:53] down
[56:56] you must be willing to lay aside
[56:57] relationships
[57:00] lay aside friendships
[57:02] lay aside your desires lay aside your
[57:04] wants give all of yourself so you can be
[57:08] all that he has called you to be
[57:11] you've got to give everything to Jesus
[57:14] brother brother Tim made such an
[57:16] incredible point the other day when he
[57:17] was preaching about the ceiling Angel
[57:18] going about into towns and he says if
[57:22] the sealing Angel can't seal that movie
[57:24] you're watching
[57:26] kill it
[57:29] if the ceiling Angel can't seal that
[57:31] relationship kill it
[57:33] if the sealing Angel can't seal that
[57:36] friendship kill it
[57:39] let me get one that's more a little bit
[57:41] more modern that a lot of people don't
[57:42] talk about if the ceiling Angel can't
[57:45] seal those reels you're watching
[57:50] kill it
[57:51] listen it's funny to me
[57:54] how you may would never turn a radio on
[57:57] you might never turn it to a rock
[57:59] station country station rap station
[58:01] whatever station that would draw you you
[58:03] might never look at those things and yet
[58:05] you know more hit songs than most people
[58:07] in the world because you watch reels
[58:11] and 75 young people nodded because they
[58:13] know it's true
[58:15] I ain't listening or seen a real yet
[58:17] that didn't have a soundtrack and I
[58:19] ain't come across one yet that was
[58:20] amazing grace
[58:27] it's true
[58:33] if the ceiling Angel can't seal it you
[58:35] better kill it
[58:37] you better quit playing with things that
[58:40] are designed to catch you
[58:43] designed to trap you
[58:45] designed listen the devil I mean in some
[58:49] ways we say that dumb Old Devil but in
[58:50] some ways he ain't a dumb old devil
[58:52] in some ways he's a lot smarter than you
[58:54] think because he's been studying you and
[58:56] studying Humanity for so many years he
[58:58] designs things to make you think they're
[59:00] okay and yet you are ensnared
[59:03] most of you have have good heart good
[59:06] intentions you're fighting the battle
[59:07] and so you would never intentionally do
[59:10] those things
[59:11] and yet the next thing you know all you
[59:13] do is walk around bebopping some tune
[59:16] some four or five lines from a song that
[59:18] maybe those four or five lines are
[59:20] innocent
[59:22] but do you know what that song's about
[59:25] do you know what their intentions are
[59:28] and now okay that's fine you're walking
[59:31] around doing whatever saying some lines
[59:34] that may seem innocent some of us need
[59:36] to go back and listen to the sermon
[59:37] identification
[59:39] because what you're doing is you are
[59:41] identifying yourself with that music
[59:43] identifying yourself with that cause
[59:45] identifying yourself with the message in
[59:48] that song and you were saying this is
[59:50] who I am this is what I stand for this
[59:53] is what I believe
[59:59] listen here's a simple example I always
[1:00:01] use
[1:00:03] we know good and well that the rainbow
[1:00:05] is sent from God
[1:00:07] it's a covenant but we also knew good
[1:00:09] and well that the homosexual movement
[1:00:11] has hijacked the rainbow and it's
[1:00:12] assembled today of homosexuals
[1:00:15] how many of you are going to go get you
[1:00:16] a nice big giant rainbow and put on the
[1:00:19] back of your car and say but it's for
[1:00:21] Jesus
[1:00:24] anybody want to
[1:00:28] because why it identifies you with
[1:00:31] something
[1:00:32] I don't care what your intentions are
[1:00:35] I'm sorry but your intentions in the
[1:00:37] matter are pointless
[1:00:40] your innocence in the matter is
[1:00:42] pointless
[1:00:43] they look at it and immediately you are
[1:00:47] identified with their cause
[1:00:49] and I don't even know how we ended up
[1:00:51] here but here we are
[1:00:53] be careful what you had look I'm not
[1:00:55] saying anything I'm not trying to tell
[1:00:57] you you're evil you're bad you're I'm
[1:00:59] trying to tell you be careful what you
[1:01:01] allow to ensnare you be careful what you
[1:01:03] identify yourself with be careful who
[1:01:06] you're running around with who you're
[1:01:07] hanging out with because you're
[1:01:09] identifying yourself if I hang out with
[1:01:11] somebody all the time all the time now
[1:01:13] look I realize it's a blanket statement
[1:01:15] and you can take it to an extreme but
[1:01:17] let's have a little bit of Common Sense
[1:01:18] here in what I'm saying but if you
[1:01:20] constantly hang out with somebody it's
[1:01:22] because you identify and you can
[1:01:24] Fellowship around the same stuff around
[1:01:26] the same thoughts so if I'm with you all
[1:01:28] the time I willingly can identify that I
[1:01:31] agree with you
[1:01:34] be careful where you identify yourself
[1:01:38] we'll move on
[1:01:40] God wants all it's all of you
[1:01:44] he wants you to lay everything down and
[1:01:46] the problem that we run into as young
[1:01:47] people you know what let's forget young
[1:01:49] people as human beings as people
[1:01:51] fighting this fight the problem we run
[1:01:53] into is honesty
[1:01:55] we run into a problem of honesty honesty
[1:01:58] with ourselves
[1:01:59] and honesty with God
[1:02:02] have you given every thing
[1:02:08] and if you haven't tonight just be
[1:02:10] honest about it that's where we run into
[1:02:12] the issue is the lack of honesty
[1:02:16] God wants all of you
[1:02:19] look we serve a God who is loving we
[1:02:22] serve a God who is kind we serve a God
[1:02:24] who is merciful we serve a God that
[1:02:26] loves us so much that he came and he
[1:02:28] took on flesh he took on human battles
[1:02:30] he died for your sins and he knows that
[1:02:34] the blood works
[1:02:36] he knows the power of a surrendered life
[1:02:39] he knows the blood Works he knows it
[1:02:42] will cleanse you from sin he knows
[1:02:44] you'll overcome if you surrender to him
[1:02:46] and yet even though he paid such a price
[1:02:49] even though he knows that if you'll just
[1:02:51] surrender you'll overcome even though he
[1:02:54] knows these things he still has Amazing
[1:02:56] Grace for you when you stumble and fall
[1:02:59] short he still has Amazing Grace for you
[1:03:02] when you stumble and fall but in order
[1:03:05] to obtain that Grace there takes honesty
[1:03:07] in your heart that says Lord I've fallen
[1:03:10] short Lord I didn't give you everything
[1:03:12] Lord I didn't surrender everything I'm
[1:03:15] here to repent it takes honesty
[1:03:19] there must be honesty to receive Grace
[1:03:21] there must be an admittance Lord I fell
[1:03:24] short because I held back
[1:03:28] because I didn't give enough because I
[1:03:31] didn't surrender enough
[1:03:33] Lord I know
[1:03:35] I can give you more
[1:03:38] Lord I know I can surrender more
[1:03:41] you can't just go around falling short
[1:03:43] every day go around living in sin living
[1:03:46] lukewarm never Measuring Up and yet
[1:03:49] pretending that you gave God everything
[1:03:52] that's not how it works
[1:03:56] because if you lay it all down at his
[1:03:57] feet if you repent and there's a true
[1:03:59] repentance and you've been baptized
[1:04:01] you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:02] when you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:04:04] you won't fall all the time you'll never
[1:04:06] you'll never stumble into sin on purpose
[1:04:08] you'll never willingly sin you'll never
[1:04:10] live a life in sin and that right there
[1:04:13] a life filled with the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:14] what happens when you lay it all down
[1:04:16] when you give him everything but a life
[1:04:19] that is pretending to give him
[1:04:21] everything will fall short Time After
[1:04:23] Time After Time After Time but I'm
[1:04:26] telling you tonight you don't got to
[1:04:27] stay in that condition you can lay it
[1:04:29] all down tonight you can put it all at
[1:04:32] his feet tonight you can say God this is
[1:04:34] everything do with it what you will
[1:04:37] and he promises to fill you with the
[1:04:39] Holy Ghost
[1:04:41] I know I can have more Lord
[1:04:43] there's an honesty
[1:04:45] I know there's more for us
[1:04:49] you see a Barnabas in the church
[1:04:55] 2022 so they're probably not named
[1:04:57] Barnabas
[1:04:59] but if they are
[1:05:02] you see a Barnabas in the church
[1:05:04] and we see that brother
[1:05:06] and we see that sister
[1:05:08] and they're so full of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:11] it's evident in their life
[1:05:13] there's fruits there there's Victory
[1:05:16] there
[1:05:17] and we want that we want that for
[1:05:20] ourselves and so maybe we emulate how
[1:05:22] they act in service
[1:05:26] we emulate the way others around us are
[1:05:28] acting when they're rejoicing and you
[1:05:30] know there's Victory there you know it's
[1:05:32] not a show but you emulate it because
[1:05:34] you want it
[1:05:35] or maybe we try to do what they did I
[1:05:37] saw them go to the altar maybe I'll go
[1:05:39] to the altar
[1:05:41] and maybe we even sacrifice some things
[1:05:44] we give up some things we go to the
[1:05:46] altar we give some worship during the
[1:05:49] service
[1:05:50] but the difference is between you and
[1:05:53] Barnabas or you and that brother and you
[1:05:55] and that sister is they gave all
[1:05:59] they gave everything they were willing
[1:06:02] to lay it all aside to receive the
[1:06:04] reward that they have and yet we want
[1:06:06] that reward and yet we want to hold on
[1:06:08] to some things we want to hold on to
[1:06:10] some of the world we want to hold on to
[1:06:12] some of those pleasures
[1:06:13] and why am I not getting it you're not
[1:06:15] going to get the same reward because
[1:06:17] you're not giving him everything
[1:06:19] you're not laying it all down
[1:06:22] they were willing to surrender
[1:06:25] and you still got those few things you
[1:06:26] want to hold on to
[1:06:28] those few things you want to hold back
[1:06:30] brother and you're saying I'm lost
[1:06:33] are you saying I'm lost
[1:06:34] no I'm saying it's time to be honest
[1:06:37] I'm saying don't put it off another day
[1:06:39] I'm saying you come to the Altar and you
[1:06:41] say Lord forgive me
[1:06:43] Lord I need more of you and because I
[1:06:45] know I need more of you Lord I've given
[1:06:47] up more of me I'm giving you everything
[1:06:49] that I've held back I'm going to lay
[1:06:51] more of myself on the Altar and I know
[1:06:52] you promised that more of you would come
[1:06:54] on the inside but you got to be willing
[1:06:57] to lay it down
[1:07:00] notice the very next verse
[1:07:03] after Barnabas has sold and given
[1:07:06] everything
[1:07:07] he's given us all
[1:07:09] wants the act of imitation
[1:07:13] because they're Desiring the same thing
[1:07:15] that Barnabas has
[1:07:17] a name
[1:07:19] he's got a Ministry
[1:07:21] it's a fruitful Ministry he's filled
[1:07:23] with the Holy Ghost they want these
[1:07:25] things
[1:07:26] they're warning that that same renown
[1:07:29] or let's just say it's it it's a a good
[1:07:32] honest desire you want that same victory
[1:07:35] you want that same Holy Ghost you want a
[1:07:38] healing you want a Deliverance
[1:07:40] there's a sacrifice made
[1:07:43] but there's also an intentional
[1:07:45] withholding
[1:07:47] look with me in Acts 5 verse 1.
[1:07:53] this is the very next verse after
[1:07:55] Barnabas has given on
[1:07:58] but a certain man named ananias
[1:08:00] with Safara his wife
[1:08:03] sold a possession
[1:08:05] they did the exact same thing Barnabas
[1:08:07] did
[1:08:09] and they're going to come and they're
[1:08:10] going to do a good thing they're going
[1:08:11] to give
[1:08:12] to the cause of Christ
[1:08:15] as a matter of fact they do give to the
[1:08:17] cause of Christ
[1:08:19] they give that the gospel might go
[1:08:21] forward they give
[1:08:23] so that the gospel can reach the world
[1:08:28] verse 2 and kept back part of the price
[1:08:33] his wife also being privy to it and
[1:08:36] brought a certain part and laid it at
[1:08:38] the apostles feet
[1:08:40] but Peter said ananias why has Satan
[1:08:43] filled that heart to lie to the Holy
[1:08:45] Ghost and to keep back part of the price
[1:08:47] of the land
[1:08:48] while as it remained was it not to thine
[1:08:50] own and after it was sold was it not in
[1:08:52] thy own power why hast thou conceived
[1:08:55] this thing in that heart thou has not
[1:08:57] lied unto men but unto God
[1:08:59] and ananas hearing these words fell down
[1:09:02] and gave up The Ghost and great fear
[1:09:04] came on all them that heard these things
[1:09:06] and the young men arose and wound him up
[1:09:08] and carried him out and buried him and
[1:09:10] it was about the space of three hours
[1:09:12] after when his wife not knowing what was
[1:09:14] done came in
[1:09:16] and Peter answered unto her tell me
[1:09:18] whether you sold the land for so much
[1:09:20] and she said yay
[1:09:22] for so much
[1:09:25] in other words let me interpret this is
[1:09:28] all we have to give
[1:09:31] this is all there is
[1:09:34] she's pretending
[1:09:36] that they gave everything
[1:09:39] then Peter said unto her how is it that
[1:09:41] you have agreed together to tempt the
[1:09:43] spirit of the Lord behold the feet of
[1:09:45] them which have buried thy husband are
[1:09:47] at the door and shall carry thee out
[1:09:50] then fell she down straightway at his
[1:09:52] feet and yielded up The Ghost and the
[1:09:53] young man came in and found her dead and
[1:09:56] carrying her forth buried her by her
[1:09:58] husband and great fear Came Upon all the
[1:10:01] church and upon as many as heard these
[1:10:04] things
[1:10:05] what was their sin
[1:10:08] let's think about this together for a
[1:10:10] minute what was their sin
[1:10:12] not that they didn't give everything to
[1:10:14] Peter
[1:10:18] that wasn't the sin
[1:10:20] they actually gave an offering they did
[1:10:24] a good thing
[1:10:25] it's that they pretended to give
[1:10:28] everything
[1:10:31] it was a show of reverence did they give
[1:10:34] yes they gave
[1:10:37] they gave did they worship Wednesday
[1:10:39] night sure they worshiped
[1:10:43] did they give everything they could
[1:10:46] when the spirit was moving and asking
[1:10:48] for a fresh drink did they give
[1:10:49] everything
[1:10:51] or do they pretend to give everything
[1:10:56] I was thinking about that myself this
[1:10:58] week think about yourself go back to
[1:11:00] that service Wednesday night now this is
[1:11:02] a little bit different because I'm
[1:11:03] focusing on an actual specific service
[1:11:06] versus on your life but think about in
[1:11:08] those moments
[1:11:11] when the power of the Holy Spirit sweeps
[1:11:14] through this place and there's a cry
[1:11:16] coming out from God himself I just want
[1:11:20] your worship
[1:11:23] did you withhold anything or did you
[1:11:26] pour out every bit of worship you
[1:11:28] possibly could
[1:11:32] as I thought of that I wept
[1:11:35] because I was guilty
[1:11:38] I worshiped
[1:11:40] I gave a sacrifice I gave some
[1:11:44] but was there more I could have given
[1:11:49] did I give a pretense of reverence
[1:11:53] that I really
[1:11:54] do the part that was easy
[1:11:57] or was I willing to fight through all
[1:11:59] the hindrances that we heard about was I
[1:12:02] willing to fight through the Philistines
[1:12:03] for miles and miles and miles to get him
[1:12:06] a real drink or was it
[1:12:09] yes Lord I love you thank you Jesus
[1:12:13] did I withhold something
[1:12:15] did I pretend to give all
[1:12:20] did you give everything you had
[1:12:23] and so ananias and Sapphira have put on
[1:12:25] a show
[1:12:27] to have sacrificed as much as everybody
[1:12:30] else did
[1:12:32] we did just as much as Barnabas did
[1:12:35] we gave just as much and this is what we
[1:12:38] do
[1:12:39] many times at this church man people
[1:12:40] worship people really worship so I
[1:12:44] better worship too
[1:12:46] who everybody's on their feet I better
[1:12:47] stand up too
[1:12:49] I I'm sorry
[1:12:52] here we go soapbox
[1:12:55] that whole
[1:12:59] clap clap
[1:13:00] clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
[1:13:03] clap clap to eventually that last
[1:13:06] person's like I better clap
[1:13:09] everybody else is clapping
[1:13:20] to me this is Aaron so just throw it
[1:13:23] away if you're like that's not worship
[1:13:24] that's clapping because everybody else
[1:13:25] is clapping
[1:13:29] you know I I never
[1:13:32] want to be that person that's stubborn
[1:13:34] and it's like I ain't standing up
[1:13:38] I don't care if everybody stood up I I
[1:13:40] don't want to be that person but I also
[1:13:42] don't want to be that person that's just
[1:13:44] doing stuff because everybody else is
[1:13:46] doing it
[1:13:48] because it's a show of worship
[1:13:52] be real be spontaneous don't hold
[1:13:55] anything back if you're going to worship
[1:13:57] worship give it your everything when the
[1:14:00] spirit moves be ready to do it be ready
[1:14:01] to worship worship because the spirit
[1:14:03] moves because he deserves to be
[1:14:04] worshiped praise him because he's
[1:14:06] almighty God praise him because he died
[1:14:08] for you praise him because he sent back
[1:14:10] the Holy Spirit praise him because he
[1:14:12] sent a message in this day we got a
[1:14:14] million reasons to praise him so just
[1:14:16] praise him with your whole heart give
[1:14:18] him everything that you got because he
[1:14:20] is God he deserves our worship he
[1:14:23] desires our worship just give it to him
[1:14:25] holy and when there's a love affair on
[1:14:28] the inside of you with God you don't
[1:14:30] have to force it you don't got to clap
[1:14:32] because everybody clap you don't got to
[1:14:33] stand up because everybody else stood up
[1:14:35] there's something on the inside of you
[1:14:36] ready to explode you're looking for a
[1:14:39] moment you're looking for an opportunity
[1:14:40] to say yes Lord thank you Jesus I love
[1:14:43] you Lord to stand to your feet and be
[1:14:45] identified with the weather worshiper
[1:14:47] identified with the word you're looking
[1:14:49] for that because there's a love affair
[1:14:51] on the inside of you because you've laid
[1:14:53] down yourself you've played down your
[1:14:56] ideas
[1:14:58] and it was a show of worship because of
[1:15:01] what Barnabas had done in chapter four
[1:15:03] oh so if I worship like this or I act
[1:15:06] like this or if I never miss service
[1:15:09] or if I sing with all my heart nobody's
[1:15:11] going to know that I'm lacking
[1:15:14] if I shout a little bit nobody's gonna
[1:15:16] think that I'm the one struggling
[1:15:19] no one's going to know that I really
[1:15:21] have great need of a change in my heart
[1:15:24] that I need more of God in my life
[1:15:26] there's a struggle going on between life
[1:15:29] and death it's real
[1:15:32] listen young people there's no shame in
[1:15:34] saying I need more
[1:15:39] there's no shame in saying I have fallen
[1:15:42] short
[1:15:43] there's no shame in the only real shame
[1:15:45] is continuing in a life live below your
[1:15:48] privileges do it due to being unable to
[1:15:51] admit I didn't give enough I didn't give
[1:15:54] all and so I'm going to continue this
[1:15:56] charade I'm going to continue pretending
[1:15:58] and living below my privileges and never
[1:16:01] overcoming and always falling short
[1:16:03] that's the shame
[1:16:04] there's no shame in coming to an altar
[1:16:07] young or old there's no shame in coming
[1:16:09] and saying Lord I need more of you I'm
[1:16:11] laying more of myself down tonight
[1:16:16] but we sit in service
[1:16:19] and the word speaks to our heart
[1:16:22] and you know you need more
[1:16:25] and the spirit moves
[1:16:27] and you know you should make your way to
[1:16:28] the altar
[1:16:30] Hey listen I believe in Rising above the
[1:16:32] altar
[1:16:35] but don't try to rise above the altar
[1:16:37] when you still got Junk in your life
[1:16:40] it ain't time to rise above the altar
[1:16:41] when you ain't settled it at the altar
[1:16:43] yet
[1:16:45] but you know you need to make your way
[1:16:47] to an altar
[1:16:51] don't be telling yourself that you don't
[1:16:54] need a place of repentance
[1:16:57] don't tell yourself that you don't need
[1:16:59] a place to die out
[1:17:00] as long as you've got things in your
[1:17:02] life that you haven't been able to get
[1:17:04] rid of yet you need to die out you need
[1:17:07] an altar you need to lay those things
[1:17:09] down
[1:17:10] maybe in church or youth service or
[1:17:13] Wednesday night or a Sunday an
[1:17:14] invitation is given and maybe maybe
[1:17:17] sometimes the minister just asked for a
[1:17:19] raising of hands
[1:17:20] maybe it's something that simple but in
[1:17:22] the presence of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:25] and in the presence of his people you
[1:17:27] say I'm okay
[1:17:30] and you pretend that you gave all
[1:17:32] I'm a message believer
[1:17:34] I'm a good kid
[1:17:36] I'm a Christian and you pretend you've
[1:17:39] given all
[1:17:41] you know this is just me and if it's
[1:17:43] wrong I'm sorry but I really believe in
[1:17:44] my heart all they had to do was come and
[1:17:46] say brother Peter we sold it for this
[1:17:48] much and we've got some real issues
[1:17:51] going right now and we need some of it
[1:17:52] I'm going to give you this half
[1:17:56] because it was an honest heart they were
[1:17:58] given an offering it was the pretending
[1:18:01] they were giving all
[1:18:03] just be honest with God God I know I'll
[1:18:05] follow him short
[1:18:07] I know I didn't give you everything
[1:18:09] I know that I'm not in the place I'm
[1:18:12] supposed to be
[1:18:13] and God respects an honest heart
[1:18:16] Peter I'm sorry that I can't give more
[1:18:18] right now this is all that I can give at
[1:18:20] the moment but they wanted to look like
[1:18:22] Barnabas
[1:18:23] they wanted people to think they were
[1:18:25] okay they wanted people to think they
[1:18:27] had the Holy Ghost
[1:18:29] they wanted to look like those that had
[1:18:31] given all
[1:18:32] that had surrendered everything
[1:18:34] and we get afraid of what is everybody
[1:18:37] else going to think if we admit it
[1:18:40] we get afraid of what other people are
[1:18:41] going to think if we struggle who cares
[1:18:44] what they think
[1:18:45] this is eternity we're talking about who
[1:18:48] cares what somebody thinks if they got a
[1:18:49] problem with you coming to the altar
[1:18:51] they need to be right there at the altar
[1:18:53] with you
[1:18:55] it's time to quit playing games it's
[1:18:57] time to quit pretending
[1:18:59] no amount of pretending is going to get
[1:19:01] you there
[1:19:03] no amount of pretending is going to make
[1:19:05] you miss out on tribulation
[1:19:08] brother Brown says would you raise up
[1:19:10] your hand and be honest say I've never
[1:19:12] been born again
[1:19:14] God bless you young lady That's mighty
[1:19:16] fine for you too God bless you back
[1:19:18] there sir another I'm just going to ask
[1:19:21] you so you be honest before God listen
[1:19:24] you must be you've got to be if you ever
[1:19:27] expect to make Heaven your home you must
[1:19:29] be honest with God make a stand for him

[1:19:35] afraid
[1:19:37] do you want him do you really want him
[1:19:39] friend be sincere God bless you my
[1:19:42] brother no matter how long you've been
[1:19:44] professing if it's not in you why not be
[1:19:47] honest with God
[1:19:50] oh but what's people going to think
[1:19:53] I can't speak for around the world but I
[1:19:55] believe I can speak for evening like
[1:19:56] Tabernacle when you come to the altar
[1:19:57] they Rejoice with you that's what we
[1:20:00] think
[1:20:00] that's just them taking another step
[1:20:02] that's them wanting to draw closer to
[1:20:04] God that's them wanting to go into a
[1:20:06] Rapture that's our church being
[1:20:07] strengthened right there it's rejoicing
[1:20:10] it's Joy it's happiness I love to see
[1:20:13] you come to the altar well I came last
[1:20:15] service amazing you have the courage to
[1:20:17] come again how wonderful
[1:20:20] be honest with God
[1:20:23] who won't God be mad at me after all
[1:20:25] this time that I'm not where I need to
[1:20:27] be don't you think he knows
[1:20:33] the only people you may be fooling are
[1:20:36] people that don't matter
[1:20:37] in the grand scheme of things
[1:20:39] he's the only one who matters and guess
[1:20:41] what he knows
[1:20:44] he knows right where you're at tonight
[1:20:46] he knows right where you're sitting
[1:20:48] and all he desires is an honest heart
[1:20:51] let me show you an example of this in
[1:20:53] Mark 9 17 and one of the multitude
[1:20:56] answered and said master I have brought
[1:20:57] unto thee my son which hath the dumb
[1:20:59] spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he
[1:21:02] teareth him and he foameth and Nash with
[1:21:04] his teeth and pineth away and I spake to
[1:21:06] that disciples that they should cast him
[1:21:08] out and they could not and he answered
[1:21:10] him and said oh faithless generation how
[1:21:12] long shall I be with you how long shall
[1:21:14] I suffer you bring him unto me and they
[1:21:17] brought him unto him and when he saw him
[1:21:18] straightway the spirit tear him and he
[1:21:20] fell on the ground and wallowed foaming
[1:21:22] and he asked his father how long is it a
[1:21:24] go
[1:21:25] since this came unto him and he said of
[1:21:28] a child
[1:21:29] and oftentimes it had cast him into the
[1:21:31] fire and into the waters to destroy him
[1:21:33] but if thou can't do anything have
[1:21:36] compassion on us and help us notice he
[1:21:38] tries to put it off on Jesus if you can
[1:21:41] do anything
[1:21:42] how many times do we do that Lord why
[1:21:44] can't you take this from me why can't
[1:21:46] you take this Spirit off my life I've
[1:21:48] asked and I've asked and I've asked and
[1:21:49] the spirit say why can't you take this
[1:21:51] Spirit why can't you deliver me from
[1:21:53] this lust why can't I be filled with the
[1:21:55] Holy Ghost God can't you do it
[1:21:57] and Jesus he doesn't get angry but he
[1:21:59] turns it right back around where it's
[1:22:00] supposed to be
[1:22:03] and Jesus said unto him if thou can'tst
[1:22:05] believe
[1:22:07] all things are possible to him that
[1:22:09] believeth
[1:22:10] and straightway the father of the child
[1:22:12] cried out
[1:22:13] and said with tears
[1:22:16] here's his altar moment
[1:22:18] Lord I believe
[1:22:21] in an honest heart
[1:22:23] help thou mine unbelief
[1:22:27] Lord I want to believe you
[1:22:29] but I'm not all the way there yet
[1:22:33] there's still some doubts lingering in
[1:22:35] My Heart Lord I do believe that our
[1:22:37] Christ I do believe that you can do but
[1:22:39] will you help my unbelief
[1:22:42] Lord I've tried I've come to the altar
[1:22:44] but but I hadn't given up everything I
[1:22:46] need to will you help me tonight Lord
[1:22:48] will you help me to quit pretending
[1:22:51] will you help me to surrender everything
[1:22:53] that's really on the inside of my heart
[1:22:56] it's an acknowledgment of his unbelief
[1:23:00] an acknowledgment that he just hasn't
[1:23:02] got there yet it's an honest heart
[1:23:05] I want to be Lord
[1:23:07] I believe Lord but I'm lacking something
[1:23:10] I admit it tonight Lord I don't have the
[1:23:13] Holy Ghost like I thought I did
[1:23:15] or maybe maybe I do and I'm just not
[1:23:17] achieving what you want me to be I'm not
[1:23:19] I'm not flying in the heavenlies like
[1:23:21] I'm supposed to be there's something
[1:23:23] holding me back lord I admit it tonight
[1:23:25] Lord won't you help me
[1:23:27] and in that moment the Lord meets his
[1:23:29] need because he finds an honest heart
[1:23:32] that's where we have to be at tonight
[1:23:34] young people
[1:23:36] as we begin to bring this down
[1:23:38] we must be willing to be humble enough
[1:23:41] in his presence to say I haven't given
[1:23:43] you everything
[1:23:45] there's more that I could give
[1:23:48] I know I can be more I know I can give
[1:23:51] more I know I can surrender more
[1:23:55] listen
[1:23:57] I don't know I don't want you to take
[1:23:58] this and run with it per se but you
[1:24:00] don't have to be perfect
[1:24:04] could be willing to admit you're not
[1:24:08] Lord I know I've fallen short
[1:24:10] Lord I know I haven't given it my hall
[1:24:13] Lord I know there's more Lord forgive me
[1:24:15] and help me to be what it is you want me
[1:24:17] to be
[1:24:18] instead of hiding it
[1:24:22] instead of pretending that you've given
[1:24:24] all
[1:24:25] be a pretender
[1:24:30] don't pretend you got it
[1:24:32] that's so hard for for many because they
[1:24:34] have a real experience they experience a
[1:24:37] move of God and they say I've got the
[1:24:38] Holy Ghost and they tell everybody which
[1:24:40] you should
[1:24:42] you should
[1:24:43] but then you have those moments of
[1:24:45] failure or something happens along the
[1:24:47] way and you realize maybe you didn't get
[1:24:48] what you thought you got and now there's
[1:24:50] a shame
[1:25:00] what do you think's gonna be harder to
[1:25:01] face you coming back saying I didn't
[1:25:03] have what I thought or facing him on
[1:25:05] that day going I knew but I was
[1:25:06] embarrassed
[1:25:11] there's no shame
[1:25:14] there's no condemnation
[1:25:17] being honest before God
[1:25:20] admitting it before God
[1:25:22] that's why Time After Time After Time We
[1:25:24] may seek deliverance and we fall short
[1:25:27] what time after time we fall into the
[1:25:29] same traps
[1:25:31] what time after time we can't find
[1:25:32] Freedom we want God to take things away
[1:25:35] from us and we pretend we want them gone
[1:25:38] but we won't lay them down
[1:25:42] and when you're really ready for
[1:25:44] something to be gone you'll lay it down
[1:25:47] brother Brown says so many says if the
[1:25:49] Lord will take this evil spirit from me
[1:25:52] from drinking or from gambling or from
[1:25:54] line or stealing I'll serve him but
[1:25:57] that's up to you see you got to do
[1:26:00] something too they that overcome shall
[1:26:03] inherit all things they that overcome
[1:26:05] you have power to do it but you must be
[1:26:08] willing to lay it down see she has made
[1:26:11] herself ready I like that you see God
[1:26:14] could not push us through a little pipe
[1:26:16] pull us out on the other hand and then
[1:26:17] say blessed is he that overcometh you
[1:26:20] had nothing to overcome he just pushed
[1:26:22] you through but you've got to make
[1:26:24] decisions for yourself I have to make
[1:26:27] decisions for myself we show our faith
[1:26:30] and respects to God in doing that
[1:26:34] young people we live in a world full of
[1:26:36] pretend
[1:26:37] we live in a world where boys pretend
[1:26:39] they're girls and girls pretend they're
[1:26:41] boys
[1:26:43] they got so many letters for it now the
[1:26:45] lgbtq elemental p
[1:26:48] community
[1:26:50] and we live in a world that promotes
[1:26:52] pretend
[1:26:55] it promotes pretend you're something
[1:26:57] you're not
[1:26:58] it promotes pretend that you're this
[1:27:02] listen one day and I'm not trying to
[1:27:04] scare anybody I'm just being so I'm
[1:27:06] trying my best to be so real your
[1:27:07] pretend will be made manifest
[1:27:10] your pretend will be found out
[1:27:13] this the Rapture isn't something you can
[1:27:16] pretend
[1:27:17] and this isn't to de-christianize you
[1:27:19] that this is for you to answer the
[1:27:21] question in your heart tonight before
[1:27:23] God have I given all
[1:27:28] have I given all
[1:27:33] brother Brown says in you beat just what
[1:27:36] you are
[1:27:37] and if you're not a Christian don't say
[1:27:39] you are
[1:27:40] who
[1:27:42] if you're a sinner admit it God knows it
[1:27:46] and now your sinful condition just
[1:27:48] because you belong to church that won't
[1:27:50] help you one bit you might have a
[1:27:52] confession your name on the book living
[1:27:53] a righteous life you're still a sinner
[1:27:55] you've got to be born again not with a
[1:27:59] mental mind but by something that's
[1:28:01] happened in your heart see it's got to
[1:28:03] be friends don't never let the devil
[1:28:06] blindfold you to that it doesn't come by
[1:28:08] intellectual conception it comes by
[1:28:10] birth and your life copes right with
[1:28:13] that you must have it
[1:28:16] what are you saying tonight brother
[1:28:17] Aaron I'm saying if you don't got it
[1:28:19] admit it
[1:28:21] repent tonight and lay it all at his
[1:28:23] feet
[1:28:24] I'm not calling you bad
[1:28:26] not calling you a failure I'm not saying
[1:28:29] you ain't saved
[1:28:31] I'm saying don't pretend that you've
[1:28:33] laid it all down at his feet when there
[1:28:34] are things that you haven't given him
[1:28:37] don't expect Barnabas reward when you
[1:28:39] haven't done what Barnabas had to do
[1:28:43] don't blame your lack on him when you're
[1:28:47] the one who held back
[1:28:50] be honest with God I'm not asking you to
[1:28:52] be honest with me
[1:28:55] you're the best young people in the
[1:28:57] world I love each and every one of you
[1:29:00] you coming up here at the altar saying
[1:29:02] I've been wrong I've been in sin that
[1:29:04] doesn't change how we it's not about
[1:29:05] being honest with us
[1:29:07] it's about being honest with God who
[1:29:09] already knows
[1:29:11] he already knows where you're at
[1:29:14] be honest with yourself
[1:29:16] be willing to find an altar
[1:29:19] he says if you're here without Christ
[1:29:20] tonight if you haven't got a real
[1:29:22] genuine experience I want to ask you
[1:29:24] there's too many church members today
[1:29:26] there's too many people trying to
[1:29:27] pretend to be Christians if you're not
[1:29:30] really deeply in love in your heart with
[1:29:32] Christ there's no Christ there
[1:29:37] um
[1:29:41] we gotta be honest
[1:29:43] some things sometimes it's hard to be
[1:29:46] honest with ourselves
[1:29:48] but we got too many people that we've
[1:29:49] got rock and roll in their heart but
[1:29:51] they're pretending
[1:29:53] they got Hollywood in their heart but
[1:29:55] they're pretending
[1:29:57] they got lust in their heart but they're
[1:29:59] pretending
[1:30:00] there's lies in their heart but they're
[1:30:02] pretending
[1:30:04] listen young people no amount of church
[1:30:08] no amount of jumping and shouting no
[1:30:10] amount of Youth Services no amount of
[1:30:11] running around the building no amount of
[1:30:13] religious expression is going to get you
[1:30:15] in a Rapture the only thing that's going
[1:30:17] to get you into Rapture is the token the
[1:30:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can't
[1:30:21] pretend your way to that it's got to be
[1:30:23] something real it's got to be a dying
[1:30:25] out you've got to lay yourself down and
[1:30:27] say Lord I give it all to you tonight I
[1:30:30] give you everything tonight
[1:30:33] you pretend so long and you pretend so
[1:30:35] long I hate to tell you on that day you
[1:30:37] won't be able to pretend that mama ain't
[1:30:39] there you won't be able to pretend that
[1:30:42] Daddy ain't there you won't be able to
[1:30:44] pretend that all your friends are gone
[1:30:46] it'll be a reality to you
[1:30:49] you won't be able to pretend that away
[1:30:52] lay it down tonight be honest tonight
[1:30:54] quit pretending you've given everything
[1:30:57] for there and you're trying this guy I'm
[1:30:59] not trying to scare you I'm trying to be
[1:31:01] honest with you tonight and say it's not
[1:31:03] too late the door's still open Mercy's
[1:31:05] still here Grace is still here laying it
[1:31:08] down at his feet tonight everything
[1:31:14] and we're not going to name names but
[1:31:16] every one of us know that we got friends
[1:31:17] and loved ones who we believe had real
[1:31:19] experiences with God who aren't sitting
[1:31:21] here
[1:31:25] real outpourings of the Holy Spirit upon
[1:31:28] their flesh you're upon their on their
[1:31:30] Spirit but they're not sitting here
[1:31:31] tonight
[1:31:32] they're not amongst us anymore
[1:31:36] what happened
[1:31:38] they didn't go all the way and they knew
[1:31:40] it
[1:31:41] but they weren't honest
[1:31:44] I'm telling you got to be honest
[1:31:46] because the feet of those that carried
[1:31:48] others out from your midst is at the
[1:31:50] door and it'll carry you out too
[1:31:53] if you're not real if you don't lay it
[1:31:55] all down if you're not honest before God
[1:31:56] the same spirits that carried them out
[1:31:58] will carry you out too
[1:32:00] oh I can play with this thing it'll
[1:32:02] carry you out too
[1:32:03] I can play with this thing you'll find
[1:32:05] yourself in a tribulation
[1:32:08] I don't have to lay this thing down at
[1:32:09] something little that little thing is
[1:32:11] going to keep you out of the rapture
[1:32:13] the feet is at the door to carry you out
[1:32:15] too
[1:32:16] but it's a moment of honesty There's an
[1:32:19] opportunity at repentance be real
[1:32:21] tonight and say I need to surrender more
[1:32:23] there's more for me to give tonight
[1:32:25] listen these brothers and sisters are
[1:32:27] here they're not here to judge you
[1:32:29] tonight they're here to pray for you
[1:32:30] they're here to support you they're here
[1:32:32] to lift you up it's okay to say God I'm
[1:32:34] not there yet
[1:32:36] God I need more of you tonight
[1:32:39] but there's real danger in pretending
[1:32:43] there is real danger in Time After Time
[1:32:46] coming into his presence and saying I've
[1:32:49] got it
[1:32:50] I've got everything I got need of Lord I
[1:32:53] gave you everything did you
[1:32:56] I'm right where I need to be
[1:32:59] are you
[1:33:01] brother Aaron are you trying to say I'm
[1:33:02] going to drop dead
[1:33:03] no
[1:33:05] but there is a judgment coming
[1:33:07] that no amount of pretending is going to
[1:33:10] get you out of
[1:33:12] no amount of pretending is going to help
[1:33:14] you to escape
[1:33:16] but tonight in his presence be willing
[1:33:18] to admit
[1:33:20] I need more
[1:33:22] I haven't laid it all down
[1:33:26] brother Brown says in one of these days
[1:33:27] when I come to the end of the road
[1:33:31] I didn't fix it up with the Lord a long
[1:33:33] time ago
[1:33:34] I said Lord I don't want no trouble when
[1:33:37] I come down there that morning
[1:33:39] if there's anything wrong in my life
[1:33:41] let me make it right right now
[1:33:44] for I won't have time when I come down
[1:33:46] to the river
[1:33:47] I don't want no trouble down there
[1:33:51] I'm gonna close
[1:33:55] you know at the very beginning I said I
[1:33:57] don't
[1:33:58] take these opportunities lightly
[1:34:04] y'all all know the story but we were
[1:34:06] just in Ohio
[1:34:08] youth service like this
[1:34:13] and I preached a sermon and at the end
[1:34:15] of that sermon
[1:34:17] a young girl come running to the altar I
[1:34:19] mean
[1:34:21] a lot a lot of people came to the altar
[1:34:24] but they tell me she was the first one
[1:34:25] there
[1:34:29] I'd been dealing with something heavy
[1:34:30] like this maybe people thought I was
[1:34:32] trying to scare people
[1:34:33] but I was telling them you're not
[1:34:34] promised tomorrow
[1:34:38] lay it down today
[1:34:40] get right with God today
[1:34:43] she was the first one at the altar and
[1:34:44] the last one to leave
[1:34:48] and days later her and her husband were
[1:34:50] gone
[1:34:53] their house just exploded
[1:34:56] and they were gone and and her parents
[1:34:58] reached out to me and said it's been
[1:35:00] such Comfort no one
[1:35:02] that she told us by all accounts like I
[1:35:04] said she was a Christian but she came
[1:35:05] and rededicated her life
[1:35:08] she said God
[1:35:10] I want to give you everything
[1:35:14] I can never take one of these Services
[1:35:16] lightly I can never take it for granted
[1:35:20] because every time we gather my mind
[1:35:22] goes what if it's somebody's last chance
[1:35:26] pretend
[1:35:28] don't pretend will you bow your heads
[1:35:31] with me
[1:35:40] I want to give you an opportunity
[1:35:45] right now to come to this Altar and just
[1:35:47] have a time of repentance
[1:35:50] time of prayer

[1:36:23] pray in hell
[1:36:25] [Music]

[1:36:35] now if you believe
[1:36:37] God's word and believe that I tell the
[1:36:40] truth
