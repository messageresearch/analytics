Us by your blood Lord we're thankful for that blood and for that atonement that you gave for us not only for our sins but also for our healing that anyone here tonight that's sick can be healed by your word today we give this time to you in Jesus name amen amen let's turn to Exodus 15 verse 22 amen this thought's been on my heart since the end of the service last Wednesday as I touched on this and just I knew as I touched on it I touched something the Lord uh was mindful of and just a real sweet Spirit came into the place and so I I just want to continue on this for a moment Exodus chapter 15 and verse 22 so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the Wilderness of sh and they went three days journey in the wilderness and found no water when they came to Mara they could not drink of the Waters of Mara for they were bitter therefore they called the name of it was called Mara amen we'll let you be seated uh last Wednesday I just hit a little spot on resentment and I like to speak to you uh today on faith over resentment uh just looking at this word resentment is actually a very complex thing complex word it's a complex emotion that can be uh described as a combination of anger and bitterness disgust disappointment and disapproval it's generally a reaction of being mistreated or wronged by someone or something whether that's really real or perceived and you know the Bible speaks about bitterness and all this is that's and anger and things that's contained in resentment of course there's no time to go through every scripture but few scriptures Ephesians 4 and verse 29 says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good for the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hears and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption let all bitterness wrath anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ sake has forgiven you now we know that as you can only be forgiven as you are as you forgive amen that's that's what he said in the Lord's Prayer he said forgive us as we forgive our debtors so the forgiveness that you give is the Forgiveness that you receive amen Hebrews 12 what in verse 14 says it like this 15 also follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness spring up trouble you and thereby many be defiled and and I I just been thinking on that how how Paul described it as a root of bitterness he didn't say just any bitterness but he described it as a root of bitterness and and this root you know would to signify that it's a deep-seated or underlying issue that can grow and spread when it's left unchecked and many times you know as roots you don't see the root of a tree you don't really see the roots of plants and those things can grow out and become very big and you not even realize what has happened around you and you know just this week uh uh my two my two boys uh brother Luke and brother Andrew were coming home every day and they had been working on this pool and and this pool beautiful looking pool as far as the pictures i' had seen and it had a leak in it and this leak they couldn't they took a while to find it but when they found it it was a big root they had a picture of this great big root had it growed under there and caused pipes to break and and caused it to where this pool could not really be a functioning pool or it was constantly having to add water to it and I I thought about that because there's many things in our lives as as we allow a man things to grow and become unchecked hindrances in our heart and our lives and we allow it to lay under the surface unseen by many unseen Maybe by a preacher but amen but God sees our very heart he he sees the depths of our heart and the things that we're holding and have allowed things to crack Us in the place where we become as brother brand would talk about broken sisters to where we can't even hold things of God any longer because our our heart is all broken apart by things we've allowed to grow there another translation of this is actually uh Bitter Root is not just a root of bitterness but it's translated as Bitter Root another words if the root is bitter the fruit is also bitter amen because amen when the root down there because the life comes through the root amen and so if the root is bitter that means the fruit that that tree gives off is also bitter amen it also gives off a certain taste or certain Aroma you know the root is not seen it can grow and cause or issues and you're not even realizing bitterness or or resentment can fester in a person's heart and affect their life and their relationships Nega negatively if they're not dealt with you know describing it as a root of bitterness is showing that it's not just a fleeting emotion amen it's not just a fleeting emotion or feeling I'm not talking about you having a feeling about something but then you just push that away but something that lays there constantly amen and engra becomes ingrained in your attitude towards that person or or that thing or even God Amen their attitude and can produce negative consequences not only in their lives but also lives around them amen to overcome it you have to constantly uproot that thing and when that uprooting requires to bring you to have forgiveness and also letting go amen forgiveness is not just saying I I I forgive a person but yet you still hold it you do not forgive them but if you actually have forgiven somebody you can lay that thing aside and sure feeling may come but now you can conquer that thing and not allow it to grow inside of your life resentment or bitterness is not always towards someone or something but many times people actually become bitter towards God because their life ain't exactly how they thought it would be or their expectation of God he ain't met their expectation how he would do this and he would heal this or he would save this or he would do that and many times we become bitter in our hearts toward God and if we have that bitterness or that resentment then God can't do anything for us amen God cannot move in our lives and our hearts and our services amen you know I was looking as we read the scripture the children of Israel you know they had come through the Red Sea and God had brought them a great victory anden in spite of all their doubting and in spite of all their unbelief in spite of it all God opened up the Red Sea and he brought them across the dry land and he destroyed their enemy and you thought you know they they brought them into a place amen that they begin to praise God and worship God and give God glory and you know brother brand says it like this he said when they come across that sea and got on the other side and God closed it in on their enemies those old Taskmaster he said could you imagine how those Jews felt looking back there the very things that had whipped them and beat their back with stripes pulled him over like this was now dead floating in the sea he said brother when you come to the Red Sea of the blood of God every old dirty habit that drove you to things you wouldn't do you find it dead in the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah them things floating and down Face Down In The Stream he said no wonder Moses got in the spirit he said you talk about you having some kind of new religion look at this maram a prophet is she looked out there and she picked up a tambourine and she began to beat it and dance and she began to pray God and Daughters of Israel begin to follow or praise and Moses raised up his hand and got so caught up in the Holy Ghost till he sung in the spirit Hallelujah that's right and he said the same holy ghost that was on Moses is in this building tonight same one that M made marryam dances here again tonight God is God and it changes not but notice they left that place of enjoyment of Happiness of praise and it took three days three days yeah not three months not three years three days they found themselves at Bitter waters you know after the big song was over and the big shout was over and a big Hallelujah big time was over and they started through the Wilderness and they LED them and he led them straight to Bitter Waters he said right into temptation right into where the water were bitter and they couldn't drink and they had nothing to eat and the water was bitter and the stream of mar bitter Waters laid laid right in God's path that God was leading his children isn't that strange he said isn't that strange look look like God would have bypassed all of that there was Oasis out there in the desert there was places they could have got drinks there was place but he brought them right to that place and he said ain't it funny that God's path or God's leadership will lead lead us straight by those places and lead us to Opportunities amen how to see how we are going to react in the middle of our struggle in the middle of our trial in the middle of our Temptation are we going to become bitter about it are we going to become a resentful about it or are we going to say God I have faith that all things work together for the good to them that are the called according to his purpose and if I'm at Bitter Waters I'm in his purpose if I'm in the desert I'm in his purpose if I'm at a fountain I'm in his purpose no matter where I'm at I'm in God's purpose see some are LED through Waters some through floods some through deep trials but it's all through the blood amen that's God's way of leading people how soon though they begin to resent God for bringing them to this place you know not like many today that resent God for the situation that they're in or are the way things have worked out in their life or the situation that that has happened or you know it just didn't come out like I thought it would or or this person did this to me and I I I I resent them for that if you ain't careful you're not you're not listen unforgiveness is not holding somebody else a prisoner unforgiveness is holding yourself a prisoner but if you can forgive and let those things go then you're no longer a prisoner no more it's you know to forgive somebody of something that they actually done wrong and they' done wrong to you amen forgiving some them of something is not letting them go of God's punishment no they have to make themselves right with God Amen that's between them and God but what is letting go is letting you go of the hurt and the pain amen that they cause that's trying to hold you down and clamp down on your worship and clamp down on the on the real fruit God wants to bring out of your life and here they go through the Wilderness and after the oldfashioned meeting you know ah my I just on top of the mountain and then three days later were sitting at Bitter Waters could you imagine God taking his children right after they got saved and filled with the Holy Ghost to The Fountains of bitter Waters I thought when I got saved and I filled with the Holy Ghost it was a just a Highway to Heaven brother we're going to have a good time all the way there no we're going to go through trials he said you know when you get the Holy Ghost you're going to come up against a lot of obstacles a lot of obstacles many are the Affliction of the righteous but God deliverthat said many are the afflictions of the righteous and period but he didn't leave us that way he said but but God deliver them out of them all so man no matter what situation you find yourself in if you'll put your trust in your God he will deliver you out of your situation well why ain't so and so going through this and why ain't they facing this listen it may not be for them God knows what a person can handle at what time they can handle it he knows exactly how much he can put upon you he knows exactly how much he can test you and therefore you may can hold more be tested more and somebody else can at that moment but it might be just down the road three days later that they're tested in a worse way than you are you know it's it's easy to find ourselves you know well I'm telling you what God's just cruel well is he really being cruel no he's not being cruel he's bringing you to a prepared place so if he's going to bring you to a prepared place and he's got to prepare you for that prepared place you know it's like he said I heard the story of a shepherd in Jerusalem broke a sheep's leg they said why are you so cruel the shepher being a such a cruel Shepherd why would you break the Sheep's leg said well she didn't she didn't she didn't love me she thought you know uh but I thought I thought if I would just do this and cause her to lean on me more and then so then that I could give her some special attention and she could love me more from then on so if you hear what he's saying I mean God's not going to just literally break your leg but he's going to bring you to a place that you can't do nothing on your own amen you can't do it by your own wisdom you can't do it by your own might you can't do it by your own intellect you can't do it how you think it ought to be done amen or what it should and so you have to lean on him more and realize I'm leaning on him and he's the one that is carrying me through and when you get to the other side of it you'll love him more why because it wasn't you that did it it was God that did it in you amen this is the way Jesus leads his church when they were there the waters were bitter and they couldn't drink it but God had provided a way if they had just said Lord I trust you then those bitter Waters become sweet because he said right there was a tree he had already planted he he had already prepared for this problem for this situation he already had an answer come on now if we realize God does listen your problems does not catch God by surprise said that before I keep saying it until we believe it our problems does not catch God by surprise it catches Us by surprise because we're finite beings but God has already prepared something by your problem for your way of Escape come on somebody before you even get there God's already provided a way of Escape but he's trying to let you tr get to a place that you're going to trust him no matter what happens that's right Calvary he said right there was that tree representing golgatha and Calvary he said many times we get into some hard places he said but when I get into a hard place this is a good advice when when I get into a hard place I shut my eyes and think about Calvary I don't think we any of us been in that kind of hard place come on now what kind of place was he in Calvary everybody knows that story right I mean he had been beaten he had been spit on he had been slapped he had been made fun of he had been mocked he had been strip naked and he's said Calvary he said so when I get in a hard place I think about Calvary not think about how am I going to get back at somebody not think about how am I going to get even or how am I going to hold I I think about Calvary what was in Calvary it was God's forgiveness for us and if he would take that punishment for me how how can I withhold forgiveness from somebody else preached on this before I preached on heart Trouble Over $17 it was about that man who went to the king and they brought him I brought him he held held such a debt it was over million just millions of dollars in debt and he's like I I can't pay it I I can't do it I I I I there's no way I can pay this debt and and the King and his mercy and Grace Struck it all off forgiven and this man walks out of that place walks down the street and he finds a man that owed him just a few dollars which was actually about into today's money about 17 bucks he be he had been forgiven millions and he was holding he had his hands around the but man's neck over $17 sounds like a lot of us sometimes we have been forgiven of so much I don't care who you are from the worst to the Great we're all Sinners we've all fallen short of the glory of God we have all been forgiven of much we our debt that we could not pay there ain't one person in this building could pay your own sin debt I don't care if you committed one sin or a billion sin you can not pay your own sin debt but God rich in Mercy he he shed his blood on the cross that we can be forgiven and how dare us hold somebody body's head over $17 so when I get in a hard place I think about Calvary and a redeemer who bled for me and died for my life then my trial begins to seem so little yes sir but you know and he said I he said it seems and I throw that aside and I walk on he said' what happens it makes my trial sweet it sweetens it because I'm not going through what he went through he went it through he went through it for me so I don't have to but you know the Bible there's many examples of people who displayed resentment you can go right at the very beginning of the of the whole thing when Cain amen slew his brother Abel what was it he was resentful over Abel's worship he was resentful that God would come down and be pleased with what Abel had offered and and it looked like what in the world you offering Abel you got nothing but a bloody a bleeding lamb I here I've got my fruits I've got everything that I've done and prepared all in a beautiful decorated way and God rejected me but he hasn't rejected you but see Abel was looking by Revelation he wasn't looking by his own abili or what he could do or what he could produce he was looking by Revelation and by revelation he was revealed to him that it took blood not the blood of a turnup or the juice of a tomato or the or the juice of a corn it took blood and so he brought a living D lamb and laid it there upon the Altar and hacked his throat to blood spew and him and his and his sacrifice became one and and God told told Kan said if you'll do as able you'll be accepted too but he was resentful over his worship he was resentful over God how God had accepted him hello somebody and if we're not careful and we bring it a little different manner if we're not careful we can get resentful towards other people because they look more blessed than we look oh yeah Joseph's brothers became resentful towards him because he was a supernatural boy he had Supernatural dreams and and you know the funny thing about it it they were also in his dreams they were also a part of it but they wern't the part that they wanted they wanted the one to be bowed to not bow to they wanted the one to be worshiped not worship too amen they wanted the exhaustion they wanted all that but here they saw oh Joseph you're just having a dream ain't that funny you're always in the top you're always the one being worshiped and God was showing them what was about to take place in their life if they would have only not been so resentful they could have saw it that's right but they became so resentful that they sold him for 30 pieces of silver and they put him on a camel and he went his way to to Egypt and sometimes later they were still so tore up about it that they could not see God's plan in it all and God had raised him up to be next in line with Pharaoh just as what the dreams had said and here they are and they find themselves still resentful and it kept them resentment keeps you from receiving what God really has for you Saul became resentful towards David you're going to read a good book and I'm I'm just throwing it out there The Tail Of Three Kings tells about Saul and David and Absalom and their lives and the tell that they that all the different things in Avenues as they went but here Saul began to resent David and here David had brought him one of the greatest victories in his kingdom had ever had but what happened people begin to sing the song of David ah David's killed 10,000 Sauls only killed a thousand well at least I'm killing somebody come come on he was still killing enemies he may not was doing it in the in the capacity that David was called to hello somebody but he was still killing enemies you know that's where you got to be careful amen is when you look at other people's lives and you resent because God seemingly using their gift more God seemingly doing this and we begin to re become resentful to where the point we make it a carnal thing and said they're only that because of their last name they're only that because they're doing this and that's happening and that that's going on and we put it all on the hands of man meanwhile God is the one that's doing it God is the one that's orchestrated and so if we're not careful our resentment is not really towards that person it's towards a God that's behind that person Pharisees and scribes never could receive nothing Jesus said because they res resented his teachings and Authority I'll go through a couple quotes here says if you get brother BR talk about resentment say incredible and this why this is why we got to be real careful what we bring into the house of God and say God forgive me of that and let me let that go he said see if you got a resenting audience the Holy Spirit won't even reveal yeah see something you got to have something working together they're they were in one place in one Accord then there came a sound from heaven but no matter how much I pray lay day and night studying praying before the Lord walk down here maybe anointing on me but walk up here and that resentment on you it just Grieves him right away and he won't reveal anything he said and when you walk down here under the anointing but when you walk down here under the anointing and you feel the audience under that same anointing then the the holy spirit will work and he'll begin to move and do great things for us come on somebody amen listen you may not have enough resentment in your life to hinder a whole service but you can have enough in your life to hinder what God has for you amen hallelujah that's what he said in other place he said there was a man and his wife first time they ever in one of my meetings they were sitting in the audience lady come in and sat down right beside them and this and the little lady resented it there's somebody sitting beside her resent got my PE oh got in my Pew and the lady was cuz the lady was sitting a little close and she got kind of in her way so that lady made her move back well is my right I've been here 25 five years got my own Pew no you don't you got your own seat there wherever you sit in it Hallelujah anyhow and after while this lady made her move back and she resented this this woman that moved back she resented the woman resenting her now we got two people affected but she got to praying the woman that had to move she got to praying and she said Lord I ought not do that forgive me I didn't mean it and about that time the lady that was now in front that had resented her still turned around and said sister I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that and the two the husband and wife were sick there were the two that came just first came to me the one that just made the woman but those two were were sick and just a little bit after all of that was done I seen the angel of the Lord stand on them call them by name and heal them both and sent them back to their home well again come on somebody isn't that worth saying Lord I'm sorry forgive me Lord I shouldn't acted like that I shouldn't have that in my heart amen because why that thing is sitting there trying to block the angel of God from visiting where you sit from visiting your Pew and healing your heart and healing your life and setting you free totally from that thing another place two months ago he said my church once Sunday morning Satan was doing something to try to attract the attention of the people there was an Englishman there by the name of way on his address you right all the way down he said I had a private interview told him I said Mr way you have heart trouble he even resented that I said what you come for me then why why why did you even come then so after a month after that he went to the doctor and the doctor told him you have a very bad heart so he come to the meeting one morning something was said here's a real hot headed Englishman you know had his wife a wonderful norian woman the nurse was sitting with him I said something and he resented what I said right quick and when he did they were standing on their feet and they were singing and when he did his head went back and his eyes just flipped back and his face went real red dark like that and he fell dead on the floor and the church went going on went to going on a bunch of people screaming I said sit down your train better than that just sit down and let God move and so his wife got down and tested it heart he was gone she began screaming I said sister wait just a minute till I can get out of the pull pit here we don't know what the father has planned I went down there he was just as stiff his eyes wasn't a it wasn't a put on his eyes were sticking right out like that back I couldn't feel no more heart than I could feel in that I said she said oh she begin to scream I said now just be careful easy you don't know what the Heavenly father's going to do maybe he did it for a purpose but I said because brother way was resenting and he said he and she said yeah he whispered to me that he was resenting what you had just said and I said he ought not have done that but I said Heavenly Father forgive brother wa for his error and I called for his Spirit to return and he said brother bradam and he was alive again see if anything gets out of the way just keep keep quiet right amen just keep quiet see it happens so many times when the church gets so tore up and then you end up grieving the Holy Spirit come on somebody that's what we got to do when we see something happening it's not get all tore up about it just stay Reverend and stay quiet and say God I don't know what your plans are I don't know how you're going to work this but I know you're going to work it For Your Glory and for my good therefore I can rest in that but we're speaking on faith over resentment you know in 2 Kings 4 and verse 8 reads about a woman don't know her name we know her as the shunamite woman doesn't she's never given a name but she's given this and I thought I I I caught this today again a fresh I guess said it fell on a day that Elisha passed through shunum where was a great woman didn't say her name her name wasn't what was important what was important was what was on the inside of her why why what how could he call her a great woman was it because she had certain statue in the community maybe maybe she had some money maybe but I believe as we read through these scriptures he call the scripture calls her that because of her faith a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that that as of as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread and she said unto her husband behold now I perceive that this a holy man of God which passes by us continually so it didn't take her long to be able to look past the the veil of Flesh and she said this ain't just no ordinary man this is a holy man of God so this is why the scripture would call her great because there was attachment to her of the Supernatural and and so it said let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall and let us set for them a bed and a table and a stool and a Candlestick and it shall be when he comes to us he shall turn in thither and it fell on the day that he came thither he turned into the chamber and laid there and said to Gesa servant call This shunamite And when he called her she stood before him and he said say now unto her behold thou has been careful for us with all care what is to be done to thee so what what what can I repay you with and we know gesi he said Master she don't have a child she she she don't have a child and her husband is old and he said call her and when he called her she stood in the door and he said about this season according to the time of life Thou shalt embrace a son and she said nay my Lord thou thou man of God do not lie to thy handmaid or don't give me some false hope I've been hoping for a long time he said this ain't no false hope amen the woman conceived and bear son and the season that Elijah Elisha had said un her according to the time of life brother brand talks about this talks about this woman preparing a place for a promise to be fulfilled look she could have been resented resentful well I ain't had a baby why should I take care of anybody else God hadn't given me a child so why should I care for anything else becomes resentful she could have had that but that wasn't her character that wasn't who she was something about her amen want to prepare a place for a prophet not knowing She Was preparing a place to receive a promise amen and see God knew this and he was there behind the scenes making preparations for God knows all things he's omnipotent he's omnicient he knows all things he knows exactly how to prepare you for a certain time and season in your life and how that he warns his people and gets things ready you know like this like the destruction he prepared people for the destruction to overcome it Noah his day but like he's getting ready people today he got that woman ready he says watch what that little bed did later she prepared a bed Elijah Elisha laid on the bed and while he was laying on that bed the the spirit of God fell in his heart and the anointing fell on him and he began to speak about her needs now we know the story goes on and and you know that was a great story she received a child in an old age and it seemed like you know amazing situation and how wonderful this is working out and how great this is his but about a few years later this same child is out in the field with his father and he falls dead screams you know about my head my head Maybe his son stroke or whatever and They Carried him to his mother and when she took him and brought him they brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died wow that's reason enough to have resentment can you believe this he gave me this promise and then it only was ful it was fulfilled only for this I I I I didn't even get to watch him go through school I I didn't get to watch him do this I didn't get and all these thoughts are going through could go be going and resentment could start building and bitter bitterness and if she would allowed it she would have never received this son back to life again and here she is holding this little boy and he dies and she went up and she didn't complain she didn't cry she just went up and laid him back on that bed what was she doing reminding God you gave me the promise and you're good enough to keep your promise and She lays him red back on the place amen the bed where the word was spoke to her the word was given to her and the word became fruit inside of her she gets her a a donkey and she begins to ride out and go search after the man of God CU she knows that's the only help she can have in this time and she goes out and she finds him and the man of God sees her coming he tells his servant go to her you know and go go go see what's going on and he came and he said behold the shite woman he said run now pray thee and meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child he covered all the bases is it well with thee is it well with your husband is it well with a child well she had an opportunity right there she you know wanted to go that one road yeah you know you gave him the promise but now laying dead but that's not what she said she said it is well that's right why because she was a great woman of faith that can overcome the resentment that no doubt tried to rise up on the inside of her and bitterness that tried to set in and confusion to try to go there and try to push down and keep her from receiving the promise of God but her resp response was it is well how can you say it is well brother Timothy I when you got all things all these things going because his word says it as well that's what she was speaking the word it is well well yeah I got sicknesses I'm facing it is well well I got tests I got to go through and the doctors don't know it is well come on somebody why can you say that cuz you have prepared a praise for the promise but see the heart amen where God wants to bring that promise that's why Satan is attacking it so much and trying to put bitterness there and resentment there because he's trying to feel that bed full of everything else so that the promise cannot be laid there and be brought to life in your heart the baby's dead Len L what the prophet of God said what good did a baby do for her if God gave her the baby and then he takes it away from her so you know what she did he said if she would have been just a lukewarm church member she would have got bitter right then but being that she wasn't she was blessed of God cuz she had made preparations when that happened she took the baby and took it back out the door down the street around the corner down to Elijah's room and laid him on Elisha's bed what a place to put him what a place to put here amen why what a place to put amen that the word of God is upon a heart that can receive it a heart that is open to it a heart that can say yes Lord it may look like all hell is against me but it is well it may look like my body is failing but it is well it may look look like everything is Flowing away and all kind of Trials and troubles but it is [Applause] well and we know the end of the story in that portion she received this child back to life God doesn't forget his promises I say it again God does not forget his promises if he said it it's going to come to pass if he promised you a child it's going to come to pass if he promised you healing is going to come to pass it's in his word but if she would allowed bitterness to come there and resentment she would have never received that son back to life again that's right no she would have been put him in the grave and it story been over and finished but you know her story wasn't quite finished we can read in 2 Kings 8 and verse one said then spake Elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou in thine household and sojourn sojourn wheresoever thou can soour sojourn for the Lord hath called for a famine famine and it shall also come upon the the land seven years and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years and it came to pass in the end of the seven years that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land for her house and for her land and the King talked with gesi the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things of Elisha has done and it came to pass as he was telling the king How He restored a dead body to life behold the woman with the son that had been restored to life cried to the king for her house come on somebody cried to the king for her house and for her land and gazah said my Lord oh King this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king K appointed to Earth certain officers saying restore all that was hers come on somebody restore all that was hers and all to the fruit of the field since the day she left the land and even unto now Hallelujah I think about that tonight church we are a people we are a woman that has the son we have the presence of the son why because we have believed and we've laid upon the promise of God and we have come back to our place of inheritance yes it's been a s a famine for seven years or seven Church ages but we're going to receive the fruit of all the church ages we're going to receive the fruit of it all why cuz we cast down our resentment we cast down our bitterness we cast down our unforgiveness and we say yes Lord it is [Applause] well Hallelujah if she would not had the son she would not have had her land but because of her faith she overcame and God the king granted her back everything that was taken from her her houses her land and he knew the count of every piece of fruit come on somebody you want restoration to start in your house then stop resenting you want restoration to start then stop the unforgiveness come on whether it's toward somebody or God just let it go and say God I want that son in my house I want the presence of God in my house I want God to come in and so when I come before the king he sees that I have the token that I have the right to this land that I have the right to my inheritance I have the right to what God has given me that's B Hearts Faith over resentment I don't know why last Wednesday I would touch on that and his spirit of God would just move in the place but even brother brother Aaron was also a witness to me with it it's time to let go the Petty things of hindrances that's hindering you from giving the right fruit that you're ordained to give brother Brandon would speak about he say as he got old he said Lord don't let me become that old crabby spirit crabbiness tore up Lord just anoint me with Meek and quiet kindness and love and compassion yeah he's here again maybe just tonight want to let go of the Lord and search my heart search My Heart Lord maybe you got some of young people got resentment towards your parents just Just Let It Go bitterness and situations Let It Go think about what he gave you and what he done for [Music] you how many not not to me I but to God just said Lord I just want to lift my hands and surrender it's of all resentment bitterness malice hatred unforgiveness on to surrendered right now Lord yes Jesus lay it all aside hands up all over this place you're not alone we all fight that same battle Lord whatever I want to receive the son I want to be standing by him so everything that I have lost will be restored everything that's been taken will be given back again yes Jesus father you see the hands
