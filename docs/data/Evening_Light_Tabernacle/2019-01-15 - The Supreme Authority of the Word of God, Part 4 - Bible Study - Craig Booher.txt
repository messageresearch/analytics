TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just ask father that you'd bless our efforts bless our hearts and God write these words upon the tables of our hearts make us written epistles read and known of all man we love you and we thank you we ask that you bless our efforts now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen well it's really really good to see everybody it's been several months and it just went like this over the holidays but I've been real encouraged by all the support and so forth everybody's excitement about Bible studies I I kind of came into the ministry with Bible studies and someday I'll tell my testimony of how how I came to the Lord and how a revival started and it it that's how I came into the ministry but it we started with Bible studies and it just grew and it went for four years and about 40 souls were brought to the Lord and some churches ended up being birthed out of it over time and so I love Bible studies and I trust that maybe being in the Bible and so forth and taking these things scripture by scripture precept upon precept line upon line will be a help to everybody as well and I was talking to brother Tim last night and our last evening and brother Tim said that he as he and I talked that it would be a good idea that if you've got family members or coworkers or friends that show interest in the Bible then welcome them to come on Tuesday nights just bring them with you I'll be very very careful and and when I say careful we're not ashamed of the message but we do understand that we have terminology that people would not understand or revelation that people would not understand and so my hungers for souls and if we get new people in I'll be very careful to base everything from the Bible because the message is the Bible revealed that's what the message is there's nothing there's no fear in that challenge at all everything than all revelation of the message comes back to the scriptures and so they don't understand maybe what a prophet is that a prophet has visited this generation and and so forth but I'll be very careful to make things understandable and then if you see light breaking then what will happen is we'll work with them one-on-one and then answer personal questions that are on their heart maybe Bible questions that are on their heart and I've seen the gospel it goes from person to person it just keeps like a chain reaction it'll go from this one to this one to this one and it's exciting so brother Tim said let's open up the Bible studies once again if they show interest co-workers family members rank sinners if they show interest bring him on we just don't know what's laying there and I think it would be good little outreach for us all and so I was really encouraged by that I'm I got a subject on my heart tonight if you just want to take your Bibles we the first Bible study that we did was on the Godhead and I had a real good response to that everyone's really interested in the Godhead and I'm sure more questions will continue to unfold as time goes but it'll get clearer and clearer then we went into a Bible study as the supreme authority of the word of God part one the supreme authority of the word of God part two the supreme authority of the word of God part three we're doing the supreme authority of the word of God part four tonight and more likely we'll do five next week and we've covered the absolute we've covered searching the scriptures and and those things but tonight we're gonna get into one of the most important parts of this subject and next week as well so every part is important but I think that our hearts are going to be blessed this evening so if we'll just turn to Matthew chapter 16 and we'll start with verse 13 and if you're not too uncomfortable we'll probably have further David have a mic and we're gonna have some participation here Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say that I the Son of Man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he said unto them but who do you say that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto Him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter which means little rock or stone and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it this scripture is very familiar to us brother Branham took this scripture and it became actually one of the key emphasis of his entire message and it's actually something that you don't hear out in the denominational world you don't hear it among Christianity but brother Branham labored upon this scripture and I believe that our hearts gonna be blessed by it the Word of God should be a part of every Christians life as Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God brother Branham said we should study the Bible every day he said just like we would eat every day if we didn't eat we would grow weaker we'd get shaky dating later we'll get weaker brother Branham said the word is the bread for our souls and spiritually we'll grow weaker if we don't feed upon the Word of God every day brother random said study the word every day which is amazing he said some people pick up the Bible once a year he said but we should study the Bible every day and I think what he meant by that is we don't read it like a newspaper but we ought to pray and be sincere if we read a chapter we ought to really pour ourselves over that chapter and just say Lord show me what you're speaking of please reveal it to me give me something that will help me today and brother Branham said I never want to get tied down he was speaking with jobs and so forth he said that I can't study the Scriptures that was remarkable to me because the Bible said seek ye first the kingdom and the rest is added he said I never want to get tied down but what I can't study the Bible and I think that would it be good for all of us whether we're busy in our work busy with our school busy as a housewife with kids none of us are too busy but what we can't pick up the Bible and feed upon the Bible on us on any given day can you say men so we want to make sure we give God first place and brother Branham said you know he said how many you study the Word of God he said you go to a house and you search the scriptures he said the elect in their day they studied the day that they were living how many noes were living in the last days if there and there's false prophets there's false teaching even within the framework of this message if there's ever a time that we need to know whom we have believed not what we believe but whom we believe if there's ever a time that we ought to know what we need what we believe by the message and by the Word of God it is now and so we want to make sure that our Bibles are nice and worn isn't that right and we want to cultivate our love for the scriptures turn with me if you would to Psalms 112 we'll just start out with a few scriptures and to start kind of digging in here Psalms 112 and we'll read verse 1 you got it okay why don't we start here go ahead and read verses one through three his seed shall be mighty upon the earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endures forever blessed is the man that fears the Lord and delighteth greatly in his Commandments we cultivate a love for the scriptures it's an attitude we cultivate it's it's our attitudes toward the Word of God it's just like if we came to church with a bad attitude chances are we're not gonna get anything out of it or if you have a bad attitude towards your wife chances are you're gonna have a bad day you know so it's all about our attitude and what we look at the Word of God as if we look at it just as just a book or just a something that we got to do we'll never get anything out of it but notice the the psalmist attitude he said he said he delights greatly in the commandments how many have a love for the Word of God that there's they could be ever so down but they come to church and they hear the word of God and your heart just starts beating for it or just something about the word it does something to us let's turn to 1:19 Psalms 119 verse 47 and 48 verses 47 and 48 and I will delight myself in that commandments which I have loved my hands also while I lift up unto my unto thy commandments which I have loved and I will meditate in thy statutes ain't that wonderful I've loved his word God put a love in our hearts tonight for the word of God amen the word deserves first place 165 turn to verse 165 of 119 chapter 119 verse 165 great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them wonderful wonderful go to verse 1 of 119 and I'll let you read 1 through 6 blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the Lord blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with a whole with the whole heart they also do no iniquity they walk in his ways thou has commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect unto all thy Commandments amen I have respect unto all thy Commandments and we could we could spend a long time on respect towards God's Word but our attitude towards the word is everything brother Branham I'll read you a quote brother Branham said may I stop here just a moment and say this and it'll go on record because the recorders are going that any divine promise in the word of God if you take the right mental attitude toward any of God's divine promises it'll bring it to pass regardless of what it is if God promised it and you show the right mental attitude God will fulfill his promise to you that promise is good to anyone that will look at it in that respect so here he's saying I respect your word and I don't think the Word of God is something that any of us should ever joke about because we devalue the word like that brother Branham Moyes had the people stand at the reading of the word because he was showing respect to it as God in letter form and brother Branham had a great reverence for the words he regarded it as life and it's only life to those that regarded his life I want to read this to you too it was remarkable to me brother Branham said now remember this dear Christian friend I wouldn't stand here deceive her I'd rather he said be up in the mountains he said but you've got to know what truth is like a man just handed me a book a while ago and he said and when I took that book I laid it down on top of the Word of God and the angel of the Lord stood right there by my side and said you take that off of there it is not right he didn't want the book was air and the angel did not want that book associated with the Word of God and he said he said now we will meet at judgement and know that the angel the Lord stood right there by my chair a few minutes ago brother Neville's office there and made me take the thing away from his word because it's not right he said that's right he said that's all I knowed about it the Holy Spirit knew it wasn't right see he said here is God's Word outside of this our faith is built right here ain't that remarkable the angel the Lord told brother man take that thing away from the Bible whoo god help us to cherish it and to respect it and to love it so we can get every divine promise we'll be ours if we can approach God with the right attitude oh this one is awesome Psalms 119 verse 161 where's the mic who has the mic okay would you pass it over there 161 Prince's have persecuted me without a calls but my heart stands in all of your word in other words I have high regard for your word Lord a holy reverence for the Word of God and then he says I will rejoice at thy word as one that finds great spoil or great treasures ain't that wonderful the word we stand in all at the word brother Branham said now he said when we come to service were sincere he said and God will bless the word because we know that God's Word will not return void that the word is not the words of a man in the words of God let's turn if you would to st. John 666 and this is where Jesus was saying except to eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you so on and so forth and sister where were you read 66 through 69 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said Jesus to the twelve will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that you are that Christ the Son of the Living God amen now notice Peter says only you have the words of eternal life so the word is life to those that regarded his life now here was the word made flesh in front of them and they did not understand except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you but it didn't matter because the Bible said in verse 69 we believe and we are sure we are sure you're the Messiah we are sure you're the Word made flesh and it was he said only you have the words of life this word is not just a doctrine it is God in letter four it is life to us that regarded is life that's why we're here amen this is why we love it this is why we reverence it now notice that I love this scripture Acts chapter 5 verse 17 Acts chapter 5 verse 17 for the Micra jury seventeen through twenty then the high priest rose up in all they that were with him which is the sect of the Sadducees and were filled with indignation and laid their hands on the Apostles and put them in the common prison but the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all of the words of this life gay man you see taught that the angel released Peter and he said he said you go out there and you preach to the people all the words of this life and Boyd was life followed just the chapter before his shadow was raised and sick people up signs and wonders were done by the apostles they were packing the gospel of life the Word of Life it wasn't just embodied in Christ but it actually went over on the day of Pentecost right in to the believer since the itself turn with me if you would to Acts chapter 11 verse 12 if you want to go ahead and pass that mic down and this is when Peter same 1 Peter goes to Cornelius house and he's given witness and in Acts chapter 11 but if you'll start in verse 12 through 14 and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreover these six brother and accompanied me and we entered into the man's house and he showed us how he had been an angel in his house who stood and said before him send men to Joppa and call for Simon whose surname is Peter verse 8:14 who shall tell these tell the words but which thou and all thy house shall be saved verse 15 and as I begin to speak the Holy Spirit fell on them as on us in the beginning he shall tell you the words whereby you and your house will be saved and as he's speaking the Holy Ghost falls on them that belief if you read Peters sermon it's not rocket science it was simply the gospel just in its purest form but while he was speaking the Gentiles received eternal life they receive salvation they receive forgiveness of sins how many believe that this word is life how many believe this message is life absolutely right and if we regard it in that way and respect it in that way then it will bring life to us as well do you love the Lord that's why Jesus said if you're just writing it down in John 5:24 he said verily verily I say unto thee he he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and he won't come into condemnation but he's passed from death unto life brother Branham said in the church age book that every true revival that has ever happened in history is because men came to the Word of God he said in every age man fell because he fell from the Word of God he said but in every revival anyone that ever came was because men got back to the Word of God and it brought forth signs and wonders and healing and salvation to whole nations all at once because this word is life it's all about the attitude towards it notice this in John chapter 6 verse 63 verse 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit in their life they men wonderful what is life the word living in you the word living in me if you will turn with me to to Genesis 111 now death cannot come by the word only life can come by the word death only comes when we are hybrid it when we mix it with man's ideas that's why the Bible tells us anyone adds one word or takes one word will lose his part from the book of life so we lose life by adding or taking away from the word but death cannot come by the word because the word is spirit and the word is life so in the in Genesis 111 he said let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed and fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself and in the beginning God spoke his word and he created every tree and every fruit and every vegetable and what that means is he said every thing that God spoke whether it was a pumpkin would reproduce another pumpkin and another pumpkin or or a tomato or whatever it was every one of God's words that was original had life in it and had the power to reproduce itself isn't that right because God's Word is eternal and if it was good for a day going by it's good for today but every word of God has the power of creation behind it every promise of the Bible has the same power of creation as what God spoke in the beginning because God's eternal purpose is behind his word how many knows that that God has a his will for your life he has a purpose for our life and it's found in the word of life now every genuine seed must bring forth of its kind that's God's command but you have to watch because jesus said the word is the seed that the sower sowed your heart is a field and you've got to watch what is planted in your heart because if you take a false doctrine into your harder to bring forth death if you take the Word of God into your heart it will bring forth life ain't that right and brother Branham said now there was a sowing that took place in the 40s and 50s he said Oral Roberts Billy Graham and he said and the word has been sown he said now the Word of God that has been sown which is the message of the hour he said God is going to live in his people God is going to live in his church he said but there's also been denominational seeds that have planted he said that it's going to produce the World Council of Churches then he said you be careful what you allow in your heart and I'll say the same for the message there's a lot of things that surround the message that is not even remotely close to what brother Branham preached see this message is the perfect interpretation with divine vindication it is God this message was sent to restore hearts we don't need an interpretation of the message what we need to do is believe the message receive the message and become the Word made flesh can you say Ben now there were four kinds of ground in the Bible there was stony ground and there was thorny ground and there was the wayside and there was good ground nothing is wrong with the seed nothing say nothing nothing is wrong with the message only the ground that it's sowed in and so the incorruptible Word of God could fall in many different places and never have an effect but with the right heart and the right atmosphere and the right idea it can come right in and man fest itself and bring forth healing and bringing forth victory and it can reproduce itself how many to say Lord let me have a right atmosphere amen so we want the seat and good ground brother branham said when the rain falls that are bringing forth the crop but it's got to have the right kind of environment the right kind of atmosphere and it's an atmosphere faith every one of us got to create an atmosphere of faith brother Branham preached a message called wisdom versus faith and he said there are two different kinds of atmospheres in this world he said there's only two sources there's wisdom and there's faith and he said now if you follow those atmospheres he said you'll find out did you ever go to a church where the pastor is real starchy he said the congregation will be the same way he said it's an atmosphere that brought it he said but if you ever he said if you it they might not believe in divine healing and so on and so forth he said but if you go to a church where faith is taught there will be an atmosphere in that church and you'll be seeing healings take place automatically you'll just be seeing supernatural things automatically because preaching brings an atmosphere and brother Branham said now preaching the word creates an atmosphere one church will live and one church will die just by the atmosphere where the word is falling Wow so it isn't just the preacher that's preaching it's the it's the ground that it's falling on and that's why I'm preaching us tonight is because it's important not just the letter of the word but that we have an atmosphere in our own lives in our own homes in our own churches an atmosphere where God can deal with us they were teachable that were humble that we're ready and expecting to receive how many to say Lord start right now let me have an atmosphere because I want the word to have an effect brother Branham said the word of life cannot grow in an atmosphere of wisdom Wow the it's contrary to God God does not grow in an atmosphere of intellectualism and it just don't happen he said that it must be an atmosphere faith now there remember when brother Branham and I'll be getting to the heart of what I'm going so just bear with me brother Branham preaches when he when he opens up the revelation series he preaches that when God is speaking to the church he's speaking to two churches he said now we have thought previously that when God spoke to the church he was only sleep speaking to the ecclesia or the elected body or Bride of Christ he said that is not so he said in the book of Revelation God is condemning one group and he's praising another group he said these are two churches that he's speaking to which is Church natural or Church carnal and then he called the other church spiritual or the elected or the bride you'll find brother Branham said all the way from the beginning to end there has been two vines there was Cain and Abel Esau and Jacob Isaac and Ishmael Judas and Jesus a weed in a tear a and a virgin all the way through the Bible we see two churches and the book of Revelation shows that there is a of Revelations and a virgin bride and so brother Branham says now he's looking at this he said God why would God call the false church that a church and he said because the false church is claiming that they are Christians that they are believers of the word he said just as Islam or a Muslim would actually follow the teachings of Muhammad so does Christians follow the teaching of Christian he said the difference is one is nominal one is spirit-filled he said that's the difference between the false church and the true Church that one is nominal and one is spiritual anybody with me this isn't this is incredible because if we want to be a part of the true church then we want to make sure that we're in the in the second category Bible says ever learning but never coming to the knowledge of the truth studying their Bible memorizing the quotes ever learning but never know God that's shaking ever learning never coming brother Branham said a form of godliness if you're writing it down second Timothy chapter 3 1 through 9 we won't turn there but he says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away because the letter killeth but the Spirit gives life without the spirit we're a lost hope without the Spirit of God to quicken this word to life were wasting our time and I'm gonna read a quote that brother Tim was laboring on this weekend he said the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the days of our Lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day that you live jesus never stressed the importance of works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word that the works are going to follow he said now he knew the way the originally man got away from God was by leaving the word and when you leave the word you leave God he said thus he is presenting Jesus as presenting himself to the Church of Pergamos and indeed to all the churches that I am the word and if you want deity in your midst welcome and receive the word he meant how many went deity in their midst and then he said if we want deity then we welcome that word into our midst don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word he said this is what I'm giving you the word a revelation of myself I am the word remember that and he says now we are he said I'm sorry there it is Jesus again is the word then this word he is left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life because he said the word is life I am the truth the life on the way there it is his spirit he is life that's what the word is he is the word so when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes the word into his heart places and upon his lips it's the same as deity speaking and every mountain has got to go and Satan cannot stand before that man who amen and he said right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without a doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be right in our midst again ain't that wonderful there is a church natural and there is a church spiritual and this is why I come out of this scripture upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it because the church is not built of a just a steeple and I was in Bruges and I've seen the Catholic steeples you feel like like the Catholic Church could just stomp you into a greasy spot I mean you feel so little and I believe that they intended it that way is to create these massive beautiful buildings so big to make you feel we can squash you if you resist us but you know that ain't a church at all that's a morgue God's church is his it's not mortar it's not brick it's not steeples it's not it's not you know superficial but God's churches his people and he said he said who do men say that I am some say the Prophet some say Elijah some say this or that he said but who do you say that I am brother Branham said this was an ignorant and unlearned man that he could not even write while the priest looked at him and called him a devil and people looked at him and just saw him as nothing somehow this unlearned man with a greasy fish apron looked at the Ministry of Jesus Christ and no sinner and Jesus said who do you say he said that the Christ the Son of the Living God who that moved Jesus he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you there's no school there's no preacher there's no tract flesh and blood has not done it they're not responsible for it but my father and haven't revealed this to you Peter and upon this rock of Revelation I'll build my church and no devil in Hell can take it from my people amen because it's revealed personally to Peter and salvation was never meant to come in a group in a church but it was to come to individuals that had the revelation of the word for their day ain't that beautiful brother Brennan said built upon spiritual revelation spiritual revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ when God has made him known to you as a person as a savior as a redeemer as a healer as a king upon this rock I'll build my church that you got to know in yourself it's not good enough to be around message ranks it's not good enough to have the kind of pastor that we have but you've got to know him for yourself and you can know him for yourself they did wonderful I want to talk tonight on the rock of Revelation because this is what made brother Brent a major Don no matter how much we know the scriptures men that men could actually memorize the Bible men in prison do it they memorized every verse of the Bible and can quote any verse in the Bible and can and not even see serpent seed and look at the message and reject it altogether it has much more than the letter of the word but it's actually the revelation of the word that this message intended to get to the people and revelation only comes from God and that's the only place we can get it can you say men brother Brennan said now and you're familiar with this but I wanted to drive home rather Venom said the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized revelation means more than perhaps you realize and I'm not talking about the book of Revelation and you I'm talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church he said and then he goes through upon this rock I'll build my church and he said the church is built upon thus saith the Lord and he said how did Abel know how to offer the proper sacrifice and he goes all the way back to Cain and Abel and he begins to show revelation from the very beginning to worshipers both coming to an altar both offering worship to God one was received and one was rejected one was vindicated and one was marked by the Beast we could take a lot of time on that but the difference between the true and the false is the revelation of the word it's not the word it is the revelation of the word that makes the difference between the two turn with me if you would to first Corinthians chapter 12 first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 3 wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God call us Jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost amen the Bible said no man can say Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost now you could brother branham use this example you could pull a drunk off the street you say you believe Jesus is Lord oh yeah yeah he said that ain't what he's talking about but to to declare that that he's your Savior and to declare that Jesus is Lord takes the Holy Spirit to do it this is the separating factor between denominations and the message brother Branham said I didn't come to build a new nomination I wish I would have had put the quote down he said I did not come to build a denomination he said I come to build individuals as power houses into the stature of a perfect man what was the stature of a perfect man the dwelling place of Almighty God brother Branham came to take individuals and set them apart so God could fill them and use them in his kingdom we are there's only one church by God's grace when I went up to New Hampshire to drive that truck back from a mother-in-law I got into a truck a fella picked me up at the car place and we were going to pick up the truck and it was a it wasn't five minutes and we were in religious discussion and this fella was studied and we were just going back and forth back and forth and and I I really liked him and he was talking about churches and all of his discontent and I said there's only one church according to the Bible and he kind of looked at me I said Jesus only spoke of one redeemed Church I said there's 40,000 denominations I said that's the work of man not the work of God and he smiled and he started opening his spirit to me and he and he was discontent you can see why people are so confused I mean you're saying that you know the Baptist's are ride or the Methodists to ride or the Pentecostals are right or the Catholics are right or the armature right which Amish the Mennonites old order which one I mean it just goes and goes and goes it would give you a headache God ain't interested in it at all God has one church from one people and the only way to be a part of that church is not to embrace the doctrine but to be baptized into the body of Christ and be baptized be born again which brother Brenham said it's the same thing to be born again is to be baptized by the Spirit he did right and only then when you have a spiritual revelation of Christ as your Savior how many been saved for 20 years here raise your hand go ahead race it residence sister Linda I want you to think back of where you were and your life that you lived before you receive the revelation of Jesus Christ think about where he brought you from and the drastic change how it changed the projectory of your life all together we thank God I thank God I can raise my children under this endtime message but every one of our children need baptized with the Holy Spirit and this message was sent to bring us into an intimate relationship with God Almighty that we could have communion one-on-one with him ain't that wonderful not to embrace a doctrine thank God for the doctrine and that's what we're doing here in these Bible studies is teaching the doctrine but we want the revelation of Jesus Christ to be in our midst breaking these things to our hearts can you say men now the Holy Spirit is the author of this word the Bible said the scriptures was written by men moved by the Holy Spirit they wrote it by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit so if the Holy Spirit wrote the word the Holy Spirit is the only one that can interpret the word and the Bible tells us that it's not of any private interpretation men have tried to do it but brother Branham said the Bible is written in mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it to us beautiful and the Holy Spirit remember no man in heaven or earth could even look at the book there was not a man worthy in heaven and earth even John wept and John was in the inner circle John wet John was not nobody only the lamb could open that book only the Holy Spirit only God Himself can reveal the book to us hey man as individuals do you believe that brother Branham said this an indictment he said you're guilty with wicked hands you've took the prints of life the word of life and crucified it to the people now what did they do they didn't know it today people walk ignorant Lee they don't know that it's the truth they think it's an ism speaking of the message they don't dig deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call on God enough they just say oh well I believe there's a god devil believes the same thing devil believes more than some people that claim to believe he trembles people just believe it and go but the devil trembles knowing that judgment is coming and the people believe it and don't pay attention to the judgment that's coming he said guilty of crucifying I indict the generation he said and find them guilty by the same word that found them guilty at the beginning amen Wow he said the people good people don't dig deep enough in the spirit of Revelation they looked at the message and they just it's another ISM just shut the computer and then brother Brennan said I'm in dining the world for it they did the same thing to Jesus they looked right at it said no pastor said it was false and did not dig into the spirit of revelation didn't pray did not consider and will answer for it so this word is not to be handled superficially it should be everything to us can you say men season now you recall I mentioned at the beginning of the message the book that we're studying is actually the revelation of Jesus himself in the church and this work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together that you'll see that it won't just take an ordinary study of thinking to make the book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost it means the book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it'll take one with prophetic insight it'll require the ability to hear from God it'll require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse by verse though that's good but a mystery requires the teaching of those of the Spirit in order for it to become clear he said how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear amen amen so we want to approach the message spiritually we want to pray and say Lord how many understand what Calvary done for us you know I I appreciate it just recently I think within the last two weeks I am the same as you I appreciate what Calvary done for us but I said Lord give me a revelation of Calvary like I've never seen it before in all of the deep mysteries of God brother branham never got away from Calvary never because we depend on it it was Calvary that we were saved every man on earth was saved at Calvary every man on earth was healed at Calvary it's a finished work and that and we were included in redemption there at Calvary how many said Lord give me a clear view vision of Calvary and that's only one place and we thank God but we don't want it to stay intellectual we wanted to become a divine revelation and that's the Godhead how many appreciate the Godhead but you know that's something that we say Lord I want a clear revelation of the Godhead I want a revelation to the scripts are being my absolute I want a revelation the message of the hour there's so much rather random said we ought to pray for revelation more than anything else and I know that's shaking to us all because how many times do we not pray for revelation and I'm not trying to condemn but I'm saying that that God is inviting us into a revelation of the word like we've never had before can you say man turn with me if you would John 16 verse 12 John 16 let's read 12 through 15 verses yeah 12 through 15 I have yet many things to say and to you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that she that shall he speak and will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of minds and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath um hath I'm on there first that I that he shall take of mine and shall shout unto you amen so Jesus said in his own words that the Holy Spirit would actually bring revelation to the church that the holy s--t the operation of the Holy Spirit is what would bring truth to the people and it was not just called truth but the Spirit of Truth and that that's what the Holy Spirit would do after he left turn with me if you would to Galatians chapter 1 verse 11 Galatians 1 verse 11 and we'll read 11 and 12 but I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached to me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ this is years after Pentecost and Paul who was a messenger to the church age never went to Peter to figure out now what did the Lord say about this and what did he teach how long is the skirts supposed to be and what did he say about hair he never went to Peter but he actually went to Arabia and brother Branham said there is where he searched his experience with the word and God began to reveal himself to Paul and brother Brennan said years later when he met Peter he said they saw eye-to-eye on doctrine that only the Holy Spirit can make a man see eye to eye and doctrine but notice this it was the revelation of Jesus Christ and if you watch the gates of Hell was against Paul he was shipwrecked he was beat three times he was stoned he was persecuted by his own man his own his own countrymen rather and he said I am persuaded high third death famine nakedness cold whatever nothing will separate me from the love that is in Christ the gates of hell was against it but it never moved him he said none of these things move me see he had a revelation of Jesus Christ he had a revelation of the message for the hour listen what brother Branham said here in the power of God he said Moses write down he said when he was born they tried to kill all the children they were trying to cut off God's servant God's chosen vessel he said how they done the same thing to Abel the righteous seed how Seth took his place and over there in the Chronicles and the book of Matthew how they killed all the children the devil was trying to stop the program of God he said but they'll never stop it they'll never do it God's church will go on assures the world they tried they fed him to lions they burned him at the stake God's church moved on just the same the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it he said they'll be against it but it'll never prevail they tried to stop it they tried to burn it out they tried to feed him the lions say they said they tried a lot of things to stop out this old-time religion but it'll keep going till Jesus come there's no stopping it any man they'd that wonderful brother RAM said when the church disbeliefs Satan and believes the revelation of the word the gates of Hell will not prevail against her see they ain't just believing the word it's disbelieving the devil he ever fought him yeah we all do come in your mind you're seed you're just a mental believer you don't have a chance you know but when you disbelieve him and take God's Word into your heart the gates of Hell will not move you amen how many want that kind of stand Luke chapter 10 verse 21 Luke 10 who do we have okay let's read 21 down through 24 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things so delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the Son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which he hear and have not heard that amen amen so if the world had had created a political system to burn every Bible in the world and to shut the gospel down off the internet and to do like they did North Korea try to keep the gospel from getting to the people it would never stop the gospel because God reveals himself to individuals just like he did Abraham brother Branham said Abraham was a root worshipper worship and roots and he said and God came and appeared to him one day and this is this is not about a church or a doctrine it's all about you and Jesus Christ and fulfilling the word for your day ain't that wonderful that you could have a personal relationship with him because he said no man knows the father and whom the son will reveal him how many say Lord I want a full revelation Amen brother branham said the way up is down that we got to humble ourselves in order to receive I want to read this to you he said now he said the book of Revelation shows the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless and he said it exposes Satan reveals this works and the attempted destruction on God's people and the discrediting of his word he fights it he cannot stand it because he knows if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she stands for and what she is and that she can do the greater work she'll be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern it and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before and he will be authoritative a as when Christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert Satan hates revelation but we love it we're the true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them we love revelation I love the Word of God I love to see every revelation go from Genesis to revelations I love the Godhead I love serpent seed you know I'd talk to I talked to sinners off the streets and show them serpent seed by the Bible there's no problems it's normally with church folk that can't see it but normally a sinner right off the street they'll look and go well it's right there I mean I said I've had them do it they're like it's right there I say you're right it's right there but they've not been indoctrinated to keep them from seeing it you know there's nothing to prove and and so I mean with that with the sinner you know there's not Masood we love it I don't care what it is Lord corrected me by the word I want to be right I want to see it right how many want to see it right you know it don't quit I mean I've been serving the Lord almost 21 years and I can't I always find something where I was wrong and I want to be correct and so so it's good to be teachable it's good to be corrected as many as I love I taste it and rebuke as long as we keep ourselves humble where God can deal with us amen now here here let's turn to Deuteronomy chapter 32 so upon this rock I'll build my church and I just love the message because brother branham brings the symbol of rock out and how God hides himself in symbols and so on and so forth and I want to look at this just for a minute Deuteronomy 31 I'm sorry 32 1 through 4 this is the song of Moses if you go ahead and read chapter 32 1 through 4 give you give ear o ye heavens and I will speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth my doctrine shall drop as the ring my speech shall to still does the do as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass because I will publish the name of the Lord ascribe a greatness unto you our God first of all he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways or judgment a God of truth and without iniquity just and right is he amen he's describing to the greatness of God and he refers to God as his rock now this is a song of Moses and this is the first time that God is described as a rock and without the message you just would never see what we see in this now we know that God revealed himself in Iraq in the days of Moses when the people were in a desert place Horeb which him in a dry place they were thirsting for water and they were getting angry and Moses went to God and said Lord what do I do and he said smite the rock and it'll give forth his waters so he took the judgment rod the same Rob that he brought judgment upon Egypt with he should have smited the people because the people were murmuring but instead of smiting the people he smote the rock and when he smote the rock it began to give water and saved a perishing people brother Branham said that was a direct type of the rock of our Lord Jesus Christ when God could have smote us because of sin instead of smiting us he smoked Christ and Christ gave forth his waters on the day of Pentecost and it brought forth life to a perishing people amen amen so we see God was revealing himself in Iraq and it was a type of Calvary's fountain and the Bible said that rock was Christ and that rock followed them all through the wilderness so Moses was singing about a rock but that rock represents revelation now watch this turn with me if you would to Psalms 18 verse 1 Psalms 18 verse 1 through 3 give brother Tony I will love the Lord my strength the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from all mine enemies amen now here's David now referring to God as a rock and he says the Lord is my rock now now he's making it personal and brother branham says this in Shalom 1964 god is my rock he said how many knows what a rock represents in the by a rock in the Bible represents the revelation of God he said God is my revelation the revelation of the word is the rock he said now David is speaking God as our rock got us my rock and he said when God has been revealed he becomes a rock all right there now I'm getting into the heart of where I want to go see we need revelation in our lives but when we get revelation then you become unmovable and that's what rock stands for unmovable unchangable unshakable amen and when you have a revelation then that revelation from God becomes your rock amen how wonderful brother Branham said this he said that's what the church needs is not so much study in theology but get down to the altar till we pray and have an experience that burns into the human heart burns out all the dullness and get a new vision he said that's the way the Holy Spirit come on the Apostle such as I have give IV if anything the church needs tonight he said is to bring a fresh vision from the presence of God and let the people see that God still lives he's still in his church and Christ is returning what a revelation how many knows that we're in the second coming of Christ if you have a revelation of that then we're not ashamed the Bible said my people shall never be ashamed if we really have a revelation of the Godhead we're not afraid to stand in front of Trinitarian and say our God is one because you have a revelation from God if you have a revelation that this message was sent from God there's not a machine gun that can take it away from you there's not a lion's den' there's not a fiery furnace they had a revelation in that revelation became the rock man is unstable I can feel one way one day and feel a different way than the next I mean you young people going to college to be a rocket scientist next day I'll be unemployed how do we just have ups and downs I mean we you it can change from one day to the next because man is unstable but God is stable we need a rock we need something that we can anchor to that will hold us in our position can you say man now watch this this this is wonderful turn with me to Psalms 31 Psalms 31 verse 1 and we'll read 1 through 3 now remember these are the Psalms of David and in the times that David had wrote these Psalms Saul was chastening and God had told David that he would be the king of Israel from the time that he was anointed king to the time he became King was about 10 years of hellish agony do you think he needed a rock in that time do you think sometimes the devil get in his head when he's living in the caves of the earth and he's running for his life you think sometimes he might have doubted what happened or questioned what happened he needed a rock that he could hold to in a time of trial and these Psalms is where we pick up the revelation of God he needed a revelation I know whom I have believed I know that God's Word will not return void go ahead says in the Oh Lord do I put my trust let me never be ashamed deliver me in thy righteousness bow down thine ear to me deliver me speedily be thou my strong rock for an house of defense to save me a man for thou art my rock and my fortress man therefore thine name's sake lead me and guide me hey man how many can say Lord be my rock the world's falling apart be my rock be my fortress that's what David was saying the Lord is my rock he is my protection he's my strong place go with me 26262 verse 1 and 2 go ahead truly my soul waiteth upon the Lord from him come with my salvation he is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved a man a man it gives you it gives you somewhere to stand even in the trials and you're stripped when you have nothing left there's a rock that you're holding - that's the revelation that God gives ain't that beautiful next next psalm 71 we'll read 1 through 5 India Lord put my trust let me never be put to confucian delivering deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine ear unto me and save me be thou my strong habitation we run - I'm a continually resort thou hast given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and fortress deliver me oh my god out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man for thou thou art my hope Oh Lord God thou art my trust from my youth amen amen he didn't run to xbox he didn't run to any other comfort he ran to the word his revelation and that's where he found peace and stability amen Psalms 69 verse 1 save me O God for the waters are come in unto my soul and read verse 2 I think in deep mire where there is no standing I own come unto deep waters where the floods overflow me so here David is saying where there is no standing I can't touch the bottom floods are coming in and I can't reach the bottom now go to chapter 40 verse 1 I waited patiently for the Lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry through 43 I'm sorry for it through verse 3 he brought me up also out of it and horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings a man and he has put a new song in my mouth even praise into our God many shall see it and fear in shall trusted no less the Lord he took me out of the miry clay and he sent me on a rock he put something under my feet he gave me something to live for something to die for us something something standing something solid ain't that beautiful see that was the same rock that rock is the same rock that Abraham found that Isaac and Jacob found that Moses found it's the same rock tonight and that's that's Christ brother branham said that Moses when he was dying he said he looked off into the Promised Land and he said he waved to Israel and he said and all of a sudden he disappeared and he said that Satan argued with Michael the Archangel over the body of Moses and he said O God let me die on the same rock that Moses died on brother Branham quoted up a song that they used to sing he said if I could I surely would stand on the rock where Moses stood he said oh that's the rock I want to stand on to by faith I want to stand there that's the rock of Revelation the revelation of God made known to you ain't that beautiful that is your strength that is your shelter you'll like this one Isaiah 26 I love this one Isaiah 26 verse 3 and for God will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee trust ye in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength does anyone have a margin reading on there does anybody have in their margins what does it was it say say it again so that's exactly correct it says trust in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is the rock of ages' that's where that comes from and so God is declaring himself as the rock of ages' because brother Branham said your faith must have a resting place it must have a place where you're fake because you're gonna move but you gotta have something that will hold you still an anchor of the soul and that anchor of the soul is not in a doctrine or not in a church that changes or bodies of people that evolve but it is in something that is unchanging unmovable it is the Rock of Ages ain't that wonderful eternal unmovable turn with me to Isaiah 32 verse 1 behold a king shall reign and righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment verse 2 and a man shall be as in a hiding place from the wind and a culvert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land how many knows Jesus is this rock and the weary land and how many knows this is prophecy brother Branham said the weary land he's speaking of he's right where we're at in this world that we live in right now the end time conditions it is the weary land he said but Jesus is the rock in our weary land he said he's our rest he said all these denominations but yet Christ is our shelter in the time of a storm you know he's our cleft in the rock brother branham said you never want to answer to God for your wrong you don't want God's justice none of us want God's justice you know just our thoughts alone would be enough to pay for let alone our actions we would not want to stand before God naked without blood and many people will go to the judgment brother made him scream he actually said cut me open he said pour hot sulfur in me but don't let me go to the white throne judgment he said tear me apart by inches but don't let me go to the white throne judgment that's the kind of descriptions that he made but let me tell you you don't have to because we have a rock in the weary land and brother Branham said there is a cleft in the rock that hides his people and so that's what we want tonight is we want that cleft in the rock brother Branham said now Isaiah described him as a rock and a weary land that's this land a weary land a weary time he said there's no escape get up and go away from it he said go down and confess your sins believe on the Lord Jesus be buried with him in Baptism rise in his resurrection with the Holy Spirit it lifts you above the cares and worries of unbelief in this world and the name of the Lord is a strong tower that we run into and are safe and he said what do we run into he said we run into his word the rock the revelation of the hour the message of the hour how many believe that that it's actually a protection from the judgments upon the earth turneth if you would psalm 61 verse 1 hear my cry oh God attend unto my prayer from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou husband a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy I will ballad in that temple in that Tabernacle forever I would trust in the covert of thy wings Sayla a man all of us has had a time where we just think dear Lord I'm I just can't describe to anybody what I'm feeling on the inside the burden that I'm carrying you know every one of us you know we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling there sometimes we become overwhelmed a lot like David in the Psalms like Lord you know what will I do I want to see my momma saved my family saved my whatever it may be but you know the scripture said that from the end of the earth he cried and he said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I Amen lead me right to the revelation that I need Lord we need him we need the Spirit of God it's more than doctrine god help us psalms 125 verse 1 they that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion which cannot be removed but abide as forever hmm verse 2 as the mountains are round about Jerusalem so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even forever how many believe it glory how is it that there's a church so unmovable there founded on the rock amen turn with me to John first John chapter 2 15 through 17 love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world and the world passeth away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen that's pretty solid Matthew 7:24 we'll read 24 through 27 therefore whosoever hears these sayings of mine and doeth them I will like him liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it a man great was the fall of it would be a many a church's fall many a ministries fall many personal people fall because they were not built upon the Word of God upon divine revelation of the word I really really like this one turn to job chapter 39 39 verse 27 through 30 29 2013 ein chapter 39 27 through 30 death Diego mount up that command at that command and make her nest don't have she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the Kreg of the rock in the strong place from thence she seeketh to pray and her eyes behold afar off her young ones also soak up blood and wear the slain or there she is Amanda where the Eagles dwell on the rock I above the devil far above all the hurts of the earth ain't that wonderful I like verse 28 that word crag is where my name come from that one's free everybody loved the Lord John chapter 3 verse 1 John chapter 3 will read 1 through 7 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews this the same came to Jesus by by night and said unto them unto Him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou does except God be with him jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto Him how can i how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and the and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again amen thank you that word CE means understand he says first except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom and then in verse 5 he says except he's born again he cannot enter into the kingdom and that word CE means understand and brother branham said in order for us to understand the kingdom of God then God has to come into us to reveal it because it's all by divine revelation and brother Branham quoted this I want to read this to you out of the church ages he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says under the churches he said it's evident from the scriptures that no man of himself can can hear God that the ability has to be given him of God that in other words the carnal mind is enmity with God our thoughts our ways are not his ways our thinking is not his thinking and every one of us here if we studied the Scriptures or any given verse we would all have a different idea of what the verse meant and the only one that could tell us what it meant was him that wrote it does that make sense and so God has to come on the inside to give us understanding no man can see the kingdom except he's born again and brother Branham continues and he says that all of God's children will be taught of him he said the evidence is hearing what the Spirit says the Spirit is talking the Spirit is teaching and Jesus said he would do it when he came he will teach you all things and bring these things to your remembrance he told us that the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost that we that the teacher would come and teach us truth and that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by revelation if you heard it every moment of the day see that is the sign of the indwelling of the Spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lifted those who did not have the spirit heard it his only carnal man and put the wrong interpretation into it and went into sin in every age it is the age of the Holy Spirit to the believer in every age the evidence is the same those who have the spirit the teacher heard the word took the word and taught it the spirit revealed it to them and they were the group that heard the messenger for the Aged took it and lived it that ought to make you shout because you're able to see the things that you see and understand the things that you understand turn with me if you would revelations chapter 3 verse 15 and let's read 15 through 20 you've got the I know I know that works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou hast I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou must be rich and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may us see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me amen amen I want to look at verse 18 which is which is specific to our age he says anoint your eyes with eyesalve that thou may have see and the eye salve is the holy spirit and he's speaking directly to an endtime people and brother Branham said that without the baptism of the Holy Ghost your eyes will never be opened he said to the truce revelation of the word and he said when we were little kids he said we'd sleep up in a in a cold cabin he said there was cracks and the in the shingles and so forth and he said the snow would come in on the bed and they would be up on a straw Tech and he said the wind would blow through and I know I mean it used to happen back when I was little I know there's some people that experienced that where your eyes would swell shut from the old and and they had grease some of you heard brother BAM say this he says it a number of times and he said his mom would heat up the grease which was a cure-all in the family and they say mama mama my eyes are shut their eyes would seal shut with a matter and so she'd come and take two grease and start massaging their eyes and it would start breaking up that matter and so they could see and brother Branham actually used that simple illustration and said there's been some cold drafts blowing through the church in this day all kinds of false doctrine that is blinded the people and let me tell you there's a spirit of truth but there's a spirit of error too and when you're dealing with error you're dealing with spirits and it ain't nothing to play with just like websites disbelieve the sign and all of those things there's spirits with it and if you go give it an ear to it or given your heart to it it'll actually plant unbelief in your life you know brother Branham said Eve made her mistake when she stopped to listen so if you have your own revelation you search the Scriptures not unbelieving websites did you know brother Branham said the minute that a question mark comes over the Word of God death sets in the moment not a denial of the scriptures or God the minute he can put a question mark in your heart on God death will sit in right there that's why if you've ever been into things you shouldn't be into you'll feel that darkness or dark heaviness and it can be just a little unbelief get away from it right away remember when brother Branham told the story of the little girl that was walking by the dance place she had been delivered of dancing real famous dancer and she was real real popular for her dancing she came to Christ and she was led to the Lord and she told brother branham's when hope was alive she said hope looks so clean and I've got so many scars brother Branham was like just just believe on the Lord you know well one day she was going to get a dress and get some goods to make a dress and she was walking by a dance place and she stopped there just for a moment and she looked in she started listening to the music and it started sounding good and she said maybe I'll go in and witness that's what she said maybe I'll go in and witness to him and she said I stepped in and next thing she knew she was in the arms of a man and they were on the dance floor brother branham was at his mom's house I believe it was and and not come at the door and brother branham said he had picked up a drunk along the road he brought this drunk to his house and he said that he put him in his bed and brother Brandon was sleeping on the other side of the room brother Ram said aren't you ashamed of yourself doing this to yourself and he's like listen you don't talk to me that way he said he heard like that he said something must be wrong there brother Brandon put on his clothes and opened the door she's an old brother branham I'm lost I'm lost Allah he said sister what's what's wrong talk to me what's going on and then she told him the story she said I was just walking by the place and I thought I'm just a witness and she said all of a sudden I went in and now I'm lost he said sister dear settle down he said all I know is the Bible says in my name you'll cast out devils and he started praying dear Lord we pray for our sister and all sudden the cupboard door started glowing and and shaken she goes what was that he goes I don't know and he kept praying for and he said all of a sudden this bat-like creature with hair hanging off its wings rose up behind him like this and he said took off flying through the room he said that drunk was setting up in bed and that just took and he cast the day it was the first devil brother Branham ever cast out of anyone and this demon attached itself to a woman just for stopping for a minute and just went in for a minute and opened a door to a demon let me tell you it is a spirit of error and devils get on you and unbelief get on you you don't want those kind of Devils on you the way to find truth is on your knees not by unbelieving websites to people that can't live a life can you say men you will find truth by the revelation of the word and you've got to have it for yourself do you love the Lord brother Branham said now there's been some cold drafts blowing through the church and this generation are you tired can we go just a few more minutes everybody okay he said now there's been some cold drafts blowing in this generation and I'm afraid that their eyes are frozen shot and are blind for what God has for and we need the oil of God's Spirit to open the church's eyes unless she receives the Spirit of God she will go on substituting program for power and Creed for word and she will count numbers for success rather than look for fruit and he said the doctors of theology have shut the door of faith and forbade all to enter neither will they go in or let anyone else in he said we don't need psychology what we need is the Bible you don't need any doctor to explain it to you you need the Holy Ghost to let him in and let him do the explaining to you so he says here in the book of Revelation If any man open I will come into him and I will sup with him and he with me do you remember those on the road to Emmaus when Jesus walked with them their eyes were closed they had no clue who he was they had no idea who he was but when he got into the room with them and sat down all sudden he broke bread and their eyes were open it was him all the time but now their understanding was open and the Bible said he opened their understanding of the scriptures so many of people have the Bible's memorized but don't have the understanding of what God is saying do you love the Lord amen so we want God to Oh our understanding just like he did with Gaza remember gays a house get hazed awoke up in the morning and he looked and he saw all the Syrians he said master master they got us surrounded Elisha looked I said there's more of us and there is them now they were always there but he couldn't see him so he prayed Lord open this guy's eyes and when he opened his eyes he saw there was more of us than there is them Amen see it takes our eye sight we see with her heart and not her eyes but by faith Abraham saw Isaac coming encountered and he staggered not at the promise of God he saw that by faith because God opened his eyes it was a revelation that Isaac was coming can you say men Moses by faith saw him who is invisible it was by faith that Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice it was my revelation he offered a more excellent sacrifice it was by faith that the walls of Jericho came down you could actually go into the book of Revelation and by faith by faith you can put by revelation by revelation because brother Branham said faith and a revelation is the same thing you can't have faith without a revealed to you ain't that right and so just like your salvation it must it must be open to you it must be revealed to you that there is a door of salvation a door of healing there's the holy spirit for you or whatever divine promise God has for us it takes faith God to open our eyes to see it ain't that right so brother Branham said we see with our heart we see with understanding and faith is a revelation from God and then brother Branham said faith he said faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet faith is a revelation of the will of God for your life by and he says he talked to a man and said we refuse all revelations and brother Branham said then you've got to refuse cry he said because Christ is the revelation of God and the Spirit of God revealed in human form everybody with me and so we want a revelation of our part in this message we have gifts in our lives and every one of us play a part and don't think that you don't if God opened your eyes to this message then you have a part to play maybe you're a musician maybe you're a preacher maybe maybe you're a witness whatever it may be God knows what it is but every one of us need a revelation of our purpose here on earth if you've got breath in your lungs then there's a purpose for you being here can you say Amen there's a reason why we're here and that'll take divine revelation can you say man I would wrap this up I think you might be getting a little tired I wonder I want to read this to you turn with me to Ephesians chapter one verse fifteen Fijians one let's read 15 through 18 where's the microphone where we at oh I know you can read 15 through 18 wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you and you're in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know that what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance and the Saints beautiful so Paul's praying now for the church that the eyes of their understanding would be in lie this is very familiar to us but how many here want revelation from God I'm gonna read this to you brother Bram said if revelation is beyond you look up and seek God for it that is the only way you're ever going to get it a revelation has to come from God it never comes by human natural endowment but by spiritual endowment you can even memorize the scripture and that's wonderful but that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God it says in the word that no man can say Jesus is the Christ but by the Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy Ghost and then only then can the Spirit give you a revelation that Jesus is the Christ the Anointed One no man knows the things of God saved the Spirit of God and to whom the Spirit of God will reveal him we need to call on God for revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but still it's not real for most people because the revelation of the Spirit is not there the word has not been quickened he said now in 1st Corinthians 5:21 that we would become the righteousness of God by our union with Jesus Christ did you get it it says we are the righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that Jesus became sin for us and it does not say he became sinful but that he became sin that by our union with him we might become the righteousness of God if we accept the fact and we must that Jesus became sin for us then we must also accept the fact that by our union with him we have become the very righteousness of God watch this to reject the one is to reject the other to accept the one is to accept the other now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation is missing it's not real to the majority of God's children it's just a good verse in the Bible but we need to have it it made a life to us and that will take Revelation brother Branham said she is the sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ now every one of us know our own lives and our own heart and we look in the mirror every day and how many can say I am the righteousness of God you know that's amazing how Hollywood how they portray Moses you know Charleston Heston hero like you know muscles it ya know he had a stutter God uses simplicity people like you and I honestly how many can stand up say I am the righteousness of God but the Bible says we are and that will take Revelation why are you talking about Revelation because we need it tonight we believe that he became sin right that part is easy but the part that applies to us that we are the righteousness of God that's where we say God help us me you absolutely we must believe it because God's only taking a bride without spot into the rapture ain't that wonderful now watch what he says cuz I've bear with me a few more minutes I won't hold you much longer no one can doubt that the scribes and the Pharisees and the great scholars the nineteen I'm sorry in a t-33 knew the exact laws of grammar and exact meanings of the words in the Old Testament but all their superb knowledge they miss the revelation of God's promised Word and manifested son there he was set forth from Genesis to Malachi with all the chapters devoted to him and his ministry and only a few was illuminated by the spirit they missed him entirely now he said we come to the conclusion that we have already found in the word as we believe and are trying to find the oldest manuscripts and get the best records of the word possible we will never get the true meaning of the study in comparison of scriptures as sincere as we may be it will take the revelation from God to bring it out that's exactly what Paul said things which we speak not in words which man's wisdom teaches but what the Holy Spirit teaches now he said don't let be misled I believe in the accuracy of the Scriptures he says but we need the Spirit to teach it to us how we need a revelation of the Spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some are good I'm not against it we need a revelation of the Spirit and thank God we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by the spirit and may God by his Spirit give us continuous life-giving say life-giving continuous progressive never stopping continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become it the Living Word manifested we would do the greater works and glorify God in heaven I'm just going to stop there how many want to do the greater works how many say Lord I want to be a spiritual believer I want to be a spiritual church Oh what I need a revelation from God I want to go deeper in Christ how many feel that way I do I want to go deeper we've looked at he is our rock he was David's rock he was Moses Rock he was Abraham's Rock he's got to be your rock tonight he's got to be my rock we thank God for a good pastor that he has a rock but I need a rock you need a rock we need a personal experience we thank God for the prophet and the Prophet had a rock but we can have the same Rock he had how many say yes Lord tonight let's pray when we pray when we go home and pray I want you to pray the Lord let me see you like I've never seen you before let me see a true revelation of the Scriptures let me fall in love with you all over again let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we've just taken a walk through the scriptures and dealing with divine revelation God it moves our hearts Lord just to see the promises that we have before us how many ages had slipped through their fingers and they missed it god help us not to miss it I pray dear God that everyone that has participated Lord they've read and they've helped read and they've given their attention to your word I pray Lord that the Holy Spirit will be their portion every one of us here that have our heads bowed we have a desire for more of you I pray dear God that should just be our portion continue to reveal yourself continue Lord to open our hearts to those things that are true let us see Calvary like we've never seen it before let us fall in love with this word like never before give these young people Lord a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit God we love you with all of our hearts lead us and guide us thank you for an opportunity Lord thank you for a message that you've sent to this earth help us to be loyal to it help us to be faithful we love you and we thank you for all that you are in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen would you want to stand with me and maybe we'll sing I love him I love him lovey lovey he calls he first loved me [Music] and purchase my salvation whoa breathe tree let's sing it again whoo [Music] [Music] because He first loved me hand burn [Music]
