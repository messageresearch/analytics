[45:49] it for
[45:50] you amen he he's the same yesterday
[45:53] today and forever his word never fails
[45:58] amen amen if you have your Bibles this
[46:00] morning we want to go to the Book of
[46:02] John the 18th chapter The Book of John
[46:04] the 18th chapter we're going to read in
[46:07] the 37th verse of John 18 and then we're
[46:10] going to go to the Book of Luke but here
[46:12] in John 18 and verse
[46:15] 37 the Bible here says now pilate
[46:18] therefore said unto him art thou a king
[46:22] then and Jesus answered thou sayest that
[46:26] I am a king
[46:27] to this end was I born and for this
[46:31] cause came I into the world so Jesus was
[46:35] not questioning his purpose he knew his
[46:37] purpose to this end was I born and for
[46:41] this cause came I un the world that I
[46:44] should bear witness now what unto the
[46:46] truth and everyone that is of the truth
[46:50] heareth my voice amen I love that
[46:53] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[46:55] voice now if we go to the Book of Luke
[46:58] the first chapter the book of St Luke
[47:00] the first chapter it's a very familiar
[47:02] reading and it's a little lengthy but I
[47:04] pray you give me Grace this morning amen
[47:06] it's a very beautiful reading it's where
[47:09] the angel of the Lord visits Mary and
[47:12] the Bible here records to us the
[47:14] conversation between the angel and Mary
[47:17] and in the 26th verse the Bible says in
[47:20] the sixth month the angel Gabriel was
[47:22] sent from God into a city of Galilee
[47:25] named Nazareth to virgin espouse to
[47:28] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[47:29] David and the virgin's name was Mary and
[47:33] the angel came in unto her and said hell
[47:35] Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with
[47:38] thee blessed art thou among women and
[47:41] when she saw him she was troubled at his
[47:44] saying watch this and cast in her mind
[47:47] what manner of salutation this should be
[47:50] the angel said unto her fear not Mary
[47:53] for thou Hast found favor with God and
[47:56] behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[47:58] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[48:01] name Jesus he shall be great shall be
[48:03] called the son of the highest and the
[48:05] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[48:07] of his father David and he shall reign
[48:10] over the house of Jacob forever and of
[48:12] his kingdom there shall be no end now I
[48:15] want you to notice something here after
[48:17] all those things that the angel tells
[48:19] Mary here in the 34th verse but Mary
[48:22] said un the angel how shall this be
[48:24] seeing I know not a man and the angel
[48:27] answered and said unto her the Holy
[48:29] Ghost shall come upon thee I believe
[48:31] that Holy Ghost is right here in this
[48:32] building this morning the Holy Ghost
[48:34] shall come upon thee and the power of
[48:37] the highest shall overshadow thee and
[48:39] therefore also that Holy thing which
[48:41] shall be born of thee shall be called
[48:44] The Son of God Amen I want you to catch
[48:46] that born of thee and behold thy cousin
[48:49] Elizabeth shall also conceive a son in
[48:51] her old age and this is the sixth month
[48:53] with her who was called baren for with
[48:56] God nothing shall be impossible now
[49:00] watch and Mary said behold the hands
[49:02] made of the Lord be it unto me according
[49:06] to the word to Thy word and the angel
[49:09] departed from her amen I also want to
[49:12] look at one other verse in the Book of
[49:13] Mark the 9th chapter The Book of Mark
[49:16] the 9th chapter and the 23rd verse I
[49:18] know this morning that we could read
[49:20] this by heart here today in St Mark
[49:23] chapter 9 and verse
[49:25] 23 and Jesus Jesus said unto him let's
[49:28] just read this together St Mark
[49:30] 9:23 and Jesus said unto him if thou
[49:34] cast believe all things are possible to
[49:38] him that believeth we ask Lord this
[49:41] morning to add the blessing to the
[49:42] reading of his word as you can have your
[49:43] seats here this morning amen I want to
[49:46] by the help of the Lord for just a few
[49:48] moments today if I would title this
[49:50] today I want to speak to you for a few
[49:52] moments on born to believe and bring
[49:55] forth the message of the the hour amen
[49:58] born to believe and bring forth the
[50:00] message of the hour I say this this
[50:03] morning thank God for sending us a
[50:05] Vindicated Prophet messenger with an
[50:08] absolute message to this generation
[50:11] we're not gathered here this morning
[50:12] wondering hoping guessing presuming but
[50:15] we are standing here upon Vindicated
[50:17] word that Jesus Christ is not in a tomb
[50:19] in Jerusalem he's not on a cross at
[50:22] Mount Calvary but he's right here in the
[50:24] power of his resurrection to do exact
[50:27] what his word said he would do you know
[50:29] yesterday morning we heard it put so
[50:31] beautiful that it's time to fight how
[50:33] many can agree that right now amen is
[50:35] the time to fight it's the season to
[50:37] fight it's the hour to fight and I've
[50:39] just been been pondering this quote from
[50:41] the message the power of transformation
[50:43] brother BR says now we're ready for a
[50:45] battle the trumpet is to sound the hymns
[50:48] have been saying now comes the word so
[50:50] there's the trumpet there's the singing
[50:52] and then the word he said but to hear
[50:54] these comments of these young soldiers
[50:56] here how many how many young soldiers do
[50:58] we have this morning Amen to hear the
[51:00] comments of these young soldiers here he
[51:03] said myself getting old and listen
[51:04] around in your faith amen and confidence
[51:07] in what you placed into believe that the
[51:09] message I have been given of God he said
[51:11] now if it wasn't for you all the message
[51:14] would do no good amen see it's got to be
[51:16] somebody to believe it and as long as
[51:18] it's coming from God then there's going
[51:21] to be somebody believe it as long as the
[51:23] message is coming from God there's going
[51:25] to be somebody believe it you see God
[51:28] has made a way he has affixed his
[51:30] economy like that when he sends for
[51:33] something amen there is something there
[51:35] to meet that something so God Amen does
[51:38] not send a message without there being
[51:40] somebody Amen to receive or to meet the
[51:43] promises or the challenge of the message
[51:45] he's sending he said see the Deep
[51:47] responds to the call of the deep amen
[51:49] it's God to be that way now Paul says it
[51:52] very beautiful in 1 Timothy 2 he said
[51:54] this cause also we thank god with
[51:56] without ceasing because when you
[51:58] received the word of God which you heard
[52:00] of us amen you received it not as the
[52:03] word of men but it as the truth see the
[52:06] word of God which effectually worketh
[52:08] also in you amen that belief so the word
[52:11] is not here to work in the unbeliever
[52:13] it's not here Amen to work in the make
[52:16] believer but it is here to work in The
[52:18] Believer amen because a Believer
[52:20] believes the word it's like somebody
[52:22] asked a man one time they said what are
[52:24] you he said I'm a Believer they said why
[52:25] are you a believer he said because I
[52:27] believe he said why do you believe he
[52:29] said because I am a believer now now now
[52:31] that's probably going in circles but
[52:33] there's a reality to that amen that the
[52:35] only thing a Believer knows how to do is
[52:38] believe we don't know how to guess we
[52:41] don't know how to question we don't know
[52:43] how to reason the only thing we know how
[52:45] to do amen is to believe the word that
[52:47] God has sent in the age we're living I
[52:49] want to say this we must receive amen
[52:52] and believe the message on the same
[52:54] degree or level amen it was delivered in
[52:57] now let me say this it was not delivered
[53:00] casually we heard that last night amen
[53:02] it was not delivered in a lukewarm
[53:04] manner amen but it was delivered with a
[53:06] passion it was it was delivered with a
[53:08] Zeal it was delivered with a fervency
[53:10] amen and I say this morning what we need
[53:13] amen is that same power that same fire
[53:16] amen that same fervency to come down
[53:18] amen upon this generation to believe the
[53:21] things that God has done with all of our
[53:23] hearts now amen I'm laying a foundation
[53:25] BL Braham was actually convinced he was
[53:27] not guessing amen but he was convinced
[53:29] amen that his message amen was of God
[53:32] and from God he said I am thoroughly
[53:35] convinced that my message comes from God
[53:37] I am thoroughly convinced it's not my
[53:39] own fleshly mind puffed up amen it is
[53:42] the word of God another place he said
[53:44] truly friend I believe with all my heart
[53:46] with all my faith amen I believe that my
[53:49] message comes from God it's been proven
[53:52] to you that through the years another
[53:54] place he says now that's what we're here
[53:55] for that that's my message has been all
[53:58] along is the word of God can we
[54:00] establish that amen that the message of
[54:02] the hour is the word of God he said we
[54:05] must hold on to that regardless of what
[54:07] others think is taking place always stay
[54:10] with that word see always check our
[54:12] motives and our objectives if it is
[54:14] according to the word of God if it isn't
[54:16] leave it alone but if it's with the word
[54:18] of God Amen and lines up with the word
[54:20] of God then you hold on to that the
[54:22] other place he says I'm thankful to have
[54:24] people like you all amen what would my
[54:26] message be amen if I had nobody that
[54:29] believed it amen there is people here
[54:32] that you would die for it amen for this
[54:34] message we've got he said may you not
[54:36] forget that you're a part in that
[54:38] Resurrection amen the quickening power
[54:41] is now in you it's all settled amen you
[54:43] are God's child amen this message was
[54:46] the announcement amen that quickening
[54:49] power is not coming amen but quickening
[54:51] power is here and I'll say this morning
[54:54] amen we are not looking for the Holy
[54:56] Ghost we are in possession this morning
[54:58] of the Holy Ghost we are not looking for
[55:00] the anointing amen we have the anointing
[55:03] we are not looking for the truth we have
[55:05] the truth we are not looking for a
[55:07] message amen we have a message come on
[55:10] Church we're not looking for a prophet
[55:12] amen there's been a prophet Among Us who
[55:14] has been identified by the same Pillar
[55:16] of Fire amen that led Moses and led Paul
[55:19] has returned in this generation Amen to
[55:21] lead the seventh angel amen but hey may
[55:24] I not stop there amen but may I say that
[55:27] same Pillar of Fire amen is in this
[55:29] building this morning and he is
[55:31] accompanying every word believer who
[55:33] believes this message to be more than
[55:35] the ideas of a man or the traditions of
[55:37] a church amen this is the message of
[55:40] Deliverance now when brother tells us
[55:42] how that when God gives a messeng or God
[55:44] speaks he says when he speaks to a man
[55:47] according to Hebrews 1 I believe he
[55:49] still speaks amen cu the Bible said half
[55:52] in these last days spoken somebody say
[55:54] spoken SP half in these last days spoken
[55:57] unto us amen by his son whom he
[55:59] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[56:01] also he made the worlds now that word
[56:04] spoken is a very powerful word it means
[56:06] to use in words in order to declare
[56:09] one's mind and to disclose one's
[56:11] thoughts amen so when somebody speaks
[56:14] amen what they're saying is moving from
[56:16] a fault into a word now when that word
[56:19] is spoken amen the only way you can know
[56:21] what's in their mind amen is the word be
[56:24] spoken to declare what's in their mind
[56:26] amen can I preach this morning and the
[56:28] prophet of God said what was in God's
[56:30] mind amen is now in God's church amen if
[56:34] you want to know what was in God's mind
[56:36] this morning amen open your eyes and
[56:38] look around you amen because you're not
[56:40] just sitting next to another teenager
[56:43] amen but you are sitting next to the
[56:45] materialization amen of the thoughts of
[56:47] the almighty god of what he had in his
[56:50] mind amen has now come into
[56:52] manifestation I love what the prod of
[56:54] God says when God speaks to a man he
[56:56] gives him a purpose he gives him an
[56:58] ambition amen and he gives him Faith to
[57:00] do it and to accomplish or to achieve
[57:03] amen what his purpose in life is amen
[57:06] what God called him to do see he's
[57:08] called us to be in the Church of God how
[57:11] many can agree this morning there is a
[57:13] purpose upon your life amen that this
[57:15] message has given you an ambition amen
[57:18] this message has given you Faith Amen to
[57:20] fulfill the purpose that God has
[57:23] ordained your life for now I love St
[57:25] John 18 37 maybe if it' be okay just to
[57:27] read it to you from the Amplified Bible
[57:29] it says so pilate said to him amen then
[57:32] you are a king and Jesus answered and
[57:34] said you say correctly that I am a king
[57:37] but this is why I was born see amen for
[57:39] this cause I have come into the world
[57:42] Amen to testify to the truth everyone
[57:45] that who is of the truth who is a friend
[57:47] of the truth and belongs to the truth
[57:50] amen hears and listens to my voice
[57:52] carefully amen everyone who is of Truth
[57:56] Who belongs to truth and is a friend of
[57:58] Truth amen will hear the voice of God
[58:02] Amen and they will not hear it
[58:03] halfhazard amen but they will hear it
[58:05] brother Daniel carefully and they will
[58:08] receive it carefully amen and what they
[58:10] will do is they will not just hear it
[58:12] they will not just receive it amen but
[58:14] they will give their lives back Amen to
[58:17] what they've heard and what they've
[58:18] received and I say this morning young
[58:20] people you have been born of Truth you
[58:23] have not been born of Lies you have not
[58:25] been born of sto stories amen you have
[58:28] been born of Truth the prophet of God
[58:30] said we're so glad to know amen where
[58:32] our birth comes from we are not born of
[58:35] the will of man we are not born of the
[58:36] will of flesh but of the will of God
[58:39] Amen see we're born of the will of God
[58:41] so a prophet has identified our purpose
[58:44] amen for being born and here's what he
[58:46] says we are born to believe the word of
[58:49] God we are born to believe Jesus Christ
[58:52] amen can I get a witness here this
[58:53] morning amen we are born to believe the
[58:55] word of God we are born to believe Jesus
[58:58] Christ amen see we were born to believe
[59:01] the message of the hour amen now let me
[59:03] say this there's something in you amen
[59:06] and what's in you brother B says what's
[59:07] in you is what says the message is real
[59:11] amen now think about that amen your
[59:13] flesh won't say it's real amen your
[59:15] spirit sometimes won't say it's real
[59:17] amen but there is a seed of God on the
[59:20] inside of your soul amen who is a friend
[59:22] of Truth who has come from truth Who
[59:25] belongs to truth truth and when that
[59:27] seed receives this message the only
[59:29] thing it can say Amen is that ain't
[59:32] nothing but the truth oh I say this
[59:34] morning Satan Thou Art defeated in the
[59:36] name of Jesus Christ you have no
[59:39] strongholds you have no powers you have
[59:41] no chain strong enough Amen to defy this
[59:44] generation we have not come here as a
[59:46] bunch of chickens we have not come here
[59:48] as a bunch of church members we have
[59:50] come here as the sons of Truth as the
[59:52] friends of Truth we belong to truth you
[59:55] don't belong to depression you don't
[59:57] belong to the world you don't belong to
[59:59] society you don't belong to complexes
[1:00:02] you don't belong to fear you don't
[1:00:04] belong to nervousness but you belong to
[1:00:06] truth and my Bible said You shall know
[1:00:09] the truth and the truth shall make you
[1:00:12] free well you know what I think it's
[1:00:14] time to do I think it's time to get some
[1:00:15] Elbow Room in the house of God I think
[1:00:18] it's time to kick that old cold amen
[1:00:20] formal ritualistic ungodly devil out of
[1:00:23] the house of God and bring back the
[1:00:25] liberty of the Holy goes where the power
[1:00:27] of God and the truth of God and the
[1:00:29] anointing of God and the quickening of
[1:00:31] God Amen can brood across the
[1:00:33] congregation and release to you an
[1:00:35] ambition released to you a purpose we've
[1:00:38] not come in this age to be defeated we
[1:00:40] have come here as the children of God we
[1:00:43] are the friends of Truth we belong to

[1:00:50] that's saying this message is the truth
[1:00:52] thank you buddy amen I say this morning
[1:00:54] thank God we have a Vindicated
[1:00:56] definition of what the message of the
[1:00:58] hour is we don't have to ask you we
[1:01:01] don't have to ask me we can ask a
[1:01:03] prophet he said many of you hear these
[1:01:05] remarks a message of this hour so forth
[1:01:07] what they are getting at amen is God's
[1:01:10] promise of this hour so the message of
[1:01:12] the hour amen is what God has promised
[1:01:15] to do in the present hour that he
[1:01:17] promised what he would do now I love
[1:01:19] what brother says he said I have to stay
[1:01:22] amen under the anoint of the holy spirit
[1:01:25] amen to find find what the message of
[1:01:27] the hour is amen I love that so it's not
[1:01:30] coming out of an idea it's not coming
[1:01:32] out of a feeling it's not coming out of
[1:01:34] a sensation but the definition of the
[1:01:37] message is coming out from under the
[1:01:39] anointing and you know what the Bible
[1:01:41] says the Bible says the anointing amen
[1:01:44] shall destroy the Yoke well you know
[1:01:46] what I say there's a bunch of yolks amen
[1:01:48] but there's an anointing amen that's
[1:01:50] greater than every yoke and I say this
[1:01:52] this message amen will destroy the Yoke
[1:01:55] of sin it will destroy the Yoke of
[1:01:57] fashion it will destroy the Yoke of
[1:01:59] Hollywood come on Church it'll destroy
[1:02:01] the Yoke of confusion it'll destroy the
[1:02:03] Yoke of iniquity hey we got a message
[1:02:06] and it's the king's message and it's the
[1:02:08] message of Truth and somebody this
[1:02:11] morning ought to turn loose of every
[1:02:12] idea contrary Amen to the truth and
[1:02:15] receive the truth come on Amen you've
[1:02:17] received enough lies you've received
[1:02:19] enough negativity you received enough
[1:02:22] excuses amen why don't you kick them
[1:02:24] excuses out of the house of God and let
[1:02:26] the anointing of the Holy Ghost come in
[1:02:28] amen come on well I can't I can't I
[1:02:31] can't amen but the message says you can
[1:02:34] well I won't I won't I won't but the
[1:02:36] message says you already have well this
[1:02:38] is against me and that's against me amen
[1:02:40] but if God be for you and who can be
[1:02:43] against you hey there is an anointing in
[1:02:45] the message of the hour that'll destroy
[1:02:48] the Y of the enemy and will release a
[1:02:50] prisoner from the prison or release a
[1:02:52] sufferer from the suffering hey I'm
[1:02:54] talking about the oldfashioned Holy
[1:02:56] Ghost it comes in a meeting and destroys
[1:02:58] the Yoke of the Enemy by the
[1:03:01] truth by the truth the anointing is the
[1:03:05] truth and the anointing shall destroy
[1:03:08] the Yol you know what the devil the
[1:03:10] devil don't like it but I'm going to say
[1:03:12] it amen I don't believe brother Ron I
[1:03:14] don't believe anointing is breaking
[1:03:16] yolks I believe the anointing is
[1:03:18] destroying yolks because there is a
[1:03:20] difference in something being broken and
[1:03:23] something being destroyed amen if you
[1:03:25] break something there is a possibility
[1:03:27] somewhere somebody amen can put it back
[1:03:30] together but if you destroy it amen it
[1:03:33] is beyond the hope of ever being
[1:03:37] repaired if you destroy something you
[1:03:40] might as well throw it away amen don't
[1:03:42] put it out in the shed Amen to use later
[1:03:45] amen throw it away because it is beyond
[1:03:48] repair and I want to say this morning
[1:03:50] the anointing has stepped in this
[1:03:52] building today Amen to destroy the oak
[1:03:55] amen of fear to destroy the Yol of
[1:03:58] complexes to destroy the Yoke of
[1:04:00] insecurity Amen to destroy the Yol of
[1:04:02] sickness and when that yoke has been
[1:04:04] destroyed we ought to throw the thing
[1:04:07] away we will never wear the Yoke of leoy
[1:04:10] again because the anointing has come in
[1:04:13] power has come in Liberty and has
[1:04:15] destroyed that thing hey the message of
[1:04:18] the hour has come to us amen from under
[1:04:20] the anointing he said Lord Jesus just
[1:04:22] like you did before you was crucified
[1:04:24] that they might know
[1:04:26] that the message of the hour is truly
[1:04:28] amen you have risen from the dead
[1:04:30] another place he says the message of the
[1:04:32] hour is to repent and turn back again to
[1:04:35] the faith of the father in The Token he
[1:04:37] said the message of the hour is a sign
[1:04:40] Amen to the churches it's a sign the
[1:04:41] people in the identification of Christ
[1:04:44] he said the message of the hour is amen
[1:04:47] return back to the word amen that was a
[1:04:51] Vindicated definition of the message
[1:04:54] that come from under the anointing amen
[1:04:56] I might as well say it I'm here the
[1:04:58] Propet of God said we're not come
[1:05:00] together Amen to talk about the message
[1:05:02] amen but we are come together to get in
[1:05:04] the message and the message is Christ he
[1:05:08] is the word now watch what a prophet
[1:05:10] says we are to get into it and we are to
[1:05:14] get beneath it we are to get into the
[1:05:16] message but we are also to get beneath
[1:05:19] it now when you get beneath something
[1:05:21] that means whatever is above you is
[1:05:23] what's controlling you when you get that
[1:05:25] when you get beneath something that
[1:05:27] means that has become your headship it
[1:05:30] has become your direction it has become

[1:06:36] anchor thank God we're not following
[1:06:38] everything that comes by come on church
[1:06:41] thank God we ain't fallowing every
[1:06:43] spirit and every idea that floats
[1:06:44] through the air we have an anchor we
[1:06:47] have an absolute we're tied all to the

[1:06:54] false ideas can pull us come on young
[1:06:56] people sometime or another you got to
[1:06:58] realize that this message is your
[1:07:00] purpose come on you were B amen I'm
[1:07:02] might have to borrow this heard brother
[1:07:03] bis said one time he said the message of
[1:07:05] the hour amen is not your objective he
[1:07:07] said the Rapture is your objective he
[1:07:09] said the message of the hour is God's
[1:07:11] purpose to get you to your objective and
[1:07:13] I'll say this this morning amen our
[1:07:15] objective is not tribulation our
[1:07:17] objective is not a lukor church our
[1:07:19] objective is not a bunch of church
[1:07:21] members with another idea but our
[1:07:23] objective is the change of our body amen
[1:07:26] some morning between 6:00 and 9 there's
[1:07:29] going to come a sweep over this
[1:07:30] generation listen and the only way we're
[1:07:32] going to step amen from one dimension to
[1:07:35] another is by the anointed message of
[1:07:38] the hour it's the
[1:07:40] truth I said it's the truth amen have I
[1:07:43] got any friends of Truth here this
[1:07:45] morning have I got any believers of
[1:07:47] Truth here this morning you can identify
[1:07:50] that the anointing has told you the
[1:07:53] truth now when you think about this the
[1:07:56] Bible said that Faith cometh by hearing
[1:07:58] and hearing by what the word of God
[1:08:02] brother said the word of God made
[1:08:03] manifest I love the Amplified Bible on
[1:08:06] Romans 10:17 so faith comes from hearing
[1:08:09] what is told somebody say what is told
[1:08:12] and what is heard comes by the preaching
[1:08:14] of the message concerning Christ so what
[1:08:17] is being told is what's being heard and
[1:08:21] what's being heard is what's being told
[1:08:23] so what's being told and heard is the
[1:08:26] message oh God concerning Christ amen I
[1:08:30] love acts 27:25 the Bible says wherefore
[1:08:32] sir amen be of good cheer for I believe
[1:08:36] God listen what he says that it shall be
[1:08:38] even as it was told me there's that word
[1:08:41] told again from the Amplified he says so
[1:08:43] keep up your courage men amen for I
[1:08:46] believe God and have complete confidence
[1:08:48] in him that it will turn out exactly as
[1:08:52] I have been told in other words what the
[1:08:54] angel told Paul was exactly what would
[1:08:57] be in the manifestation of the vision so
[1:09:00] there would not be one thing in the
[1:09:01] vision and another thing in the
[1:09:03] manifestation but the same thing in the
[1:09:05] vision will be the same thing in the
[1:09:07] manif come on church amen do you realize
[1:09:10] there can't be victory in the vision and
[1:09:12] defeat in the manifestation there can't
[1:09:14] be power in the vision and lukewarmness
[1:09:17] in the manifestation but whatever was in
[1:09:19] the vision is going to be in the
[1:09:21] manifestation and may I say this God has
[1:09:24] sent a promise in this generation who
[1:09:26] has seen a word Vision over you young
[1:09:28] people and he said listen I saw all them
[1:09:31] over there I saw millions of converts
[1:09:33] there but in the rising of the sun he
[1:09:36] says but I seen you there come on church
[1:09:39] I ought to make you shake off every
[1:09:40] devil out of hell and say Satan you
[1:09:42] ain't got enough to stop me I have had a
[1:09:45] vision that's been told to me by the
[1:09:48] angel of God through the seventh angel
[1:09:50] and he said he didn't see me in hell he
[1:09:52] didn't see me in the tribulation he
[1:09:54] didn't see me with the Enemy having his
[1:09:56] foot on me but he saw me Amen in the
[1:09:59] vision of Victory he saw me in the
[1:10:02] vision of rapture so you know what I'm
[1:10:04] going to do I'm going to yield to the
[1:10:06] anointing I'm going to yield to the
[1:10:08] truth and every day I'm going to take
[1:10:10] one step and another step and another
[1:10:12] step until one of these days I step out
[1:10:15] of time until one of these days I step
[1:10:18] out of mortality and step back into
[1:10:20] immortality listen I didn't come from
[1:10:23] hell so I ain't going back to hell I
[1:10:25] came from God and I'm going back to God
[1:10:28] and there ain't enough devils in Hell
[1:10:30] there ain't enough Devils on the earth
[1:10:31] there ain't enough Spirits out of pits
[1:10:33] of Hell to stop me and to stop you from
[1:10:36] going back to where you come from before
[1:10:38] you was born the truth already claimed
[1:10:45] you well come hail or how water are we
[1:10:47] going to make it amen you didn't know
[1:10:49] you was coming to preach but Char look
[1:10:50] at somebody and say we going to make it
[1:10:52] come Peril we're going to make it come
[1:10:54] unbelief we're going to make it come bad
[1:10:56] days hard days up days in days out days
[1:10:59] good days sad days sick days Jo we're
[1:11:01] going to make it amen because there's a
[1:11:03] vision of the word of God that has been
[1:11:05] spoken over our lives and we have
[1:11:08] received it as the word of God I love
[1:11:12] that word told brother said oh don't you
[1:11:14] just love that it'll be as it was told
[1:11:17] me if the angel truly comes from God and
[1:11:21] is sent from God it's bound to be it's a
[1:11:25] direct message from
[1:11:29] Glory young people that's not just a
[1:11:31] book on yourself that's not just an app
[1:11:34] on your phone that is a direct
[1:11:38] message come on church amen that is a
[1:11:40] direct message from glory in other words
[1:11:43] God has sent you something direct and
[1:11:46] it's not got one flaw in it it's not got
[1:11:49] one idea of a man in it it is the word
[1:11:52] of God made manifest listen it's not the
[1:11:55] fleshly mind of some man puffed up it's
[1:11:58] the message of the hour can I say this
[1:12:01] Mary amen received a direct message from
[1:12:05] glory and the pr of God said now there's
[1:12:07] angels of the Lord men them they come to
[1:12:09] the Earth and they bring messages
[1:12:10] somebody say messages but when Gabriel
[1:12:12] comes something Big's fixing to happen
[1:12:14] now watch what the prophet of God says
[1:12:16] and he told Mary thou has found favor
[1:12:18] with God what a message to bring her
[1:12:21] thou Hast found favor with God can I say
[1:12:25] this we have received amen a direct
[1:12:28] message it was given from the mighty
[1:12:30] angel of Revelation 10:1 delivered by
[1:12:32] the seventh angel of Revelation 10:7 can
[1:12:35] I say this who was met by the angel of
[1:12:38] the Lord Brother said and that angel was
[1:12:41] a supernatural being he said when he be
[1:12:43] to speak to me he said he be to make
[1:12:46] statements to me and I have not been
[1:12:48] disobedient Amen to the heavenly vision
[1:12:51] so in other words the mighty Angel begin
[1:12:54] to speak to the Heth Angel and the
[1:12:56] statements he was making were
[1:12:58] Supernatural statements can I say this a
[1:13:01] supernatural God Don't Make natural
[1:13:04] statements a supernatural God makes
[1:13:08] Supernatural statements and Supernatural
[1:13:10] means something that is transcending
[1:13:13] amen the course of nature can I say this
[1:13:16] amen and he was not disobedient to what
[1:13:18] was delivered to him amen I love this
[1:13:20] brother I'm speaking of the farmer
[1:13:22] sewing wheat he said now if that farmer
[1:13:24] amen takes the seed and receives it he
[1:13:26] said if he keeps digging it up he'll
[1:13:28] never have wheat he said you just sew it
[1:13:30] and let it alone see it's up to God to
[1:13:32] bring it forth listen that's why we have
[1:13:34] don't have a prophet today Amen on the
[1:13:37] earth in a physical body brother br's
[1:13:38] not here today amen going from every
[1:13:40] church amen trying to sow the message
[1:13:43] and trying to find a crop no he stood
[1:13:45] here on the platform and soow the entire
[1:13:48] word seed of the Bible into the church
[1:13:51] listen young people amen amen oh God can
[1:13:54] I preach amen amen he was the prophet
[1:13:57] amen but now the attraction has turned
[1:14:00] from the prophet Amen to the prophecy
[1:14:02] young people he was looking for you he
[1:14:04] was looking for this day he was looking
[1:14:06] for this generation come on church he
[1:14:09] was looking for a people who could take
[1:14:11] his message and not dissect it and not
[1:14:13] pull this out and put that in he was
[1:14:15] looking for a young man that would say
[1:14:17] it's the truth brother Brandon he was
[1:14:19] looking for a young girl that would say
[1:14:21] that's what he said and if I got to lose
[1:14:23] every friend I've got I'm want to stand
[1:14:26] on the word of God because it didn't
[1:14:28] come out of the Seminary it came out
[1:14:30] from under the
[1:14:32] [Music]
[1:14:33] anointing come on church amen Amen
[1:14:36] brother Josh Bennett forgive me brother
[1:14:37] Josh amen he was preaching our church
[1:14:39] other day and he made a powerful
[1:14:40] statement he said do you realize we're
[1:14:42] we're understanding things today he said
[1:14:44] that years ago when a prophet stood here
[1:14:46] and preached that people didn't have a
[1:14:48] clue about and when he said that I mean
[1:14:50] you know how the devil does when he said
[1:14:52] that an Old Devil come right by me and
[1:14:54] kind of tap me on the shoulder and said
[1:14:56] now how could that be and and just just
[1:14:58] under the inspiration brother Josh anden
[1:15:00] the Holy Ghost just spoke out of me and
[1:15:02] I literally looked over at the devil in
[1:15:03] the middle of the meeting sometimes you
[1:15:04] got to talk to the devil cuz he's trying
[1:15:05] to hinder you from a good service okay I
[1:15:07] just looked over at the Devil and I said
[1:15:09] future home Billy Paul I'll get to you
[1:15:13] later so I got in my office that Old
[1:15:15] Devil showed up again and I said devil
[1:15:17] amen you're t on with the wrong dude
[1:15:20] Amen brother B stood there and preached
[1:15:21] future home and Billy Paul walked out of
[1:15:23] there and said I understand it he said
[1:15:25] did you really he said no Daddy brother
[1:15:27] said I could count on my hand amen five
[1:15:30] people in the entire building that could
[1:15:33] understand what I was talking about
[1:15:34] listen church but here's a youth camp
[1:15:37] God here's a youth camp and it's not
[1:15:39] built on a bunch of Pentecostalism it's
[1:15:41] not built on a bunch of gifts and
[1:15:43] sensation it's built on the preaching of
[1:15:45] the message of the hour and there's
[1:15:47] about 400 young people that can take a
[1:15:50] hold a future home they can take a hold
[1:15:52] of the Rapture they can eat things that
[1:15:54] are to be listen you are the prophesied
[1:15:56] generation who's going to tear the
[1:15:58] kingdom of hell down by the anointing of
[1:16:02] the prophecy that's been spoke over your
[1:16:05] life we don't we're not here confused we
[1:16:08] have a clear understanding we are
[1:16:11] understanding things that Generations
[1:16:13] long to understand now that same Prophet
[1:16:16] said that faith is a substance of things
[1:16:18] hope for he said now what is faith is
[1:16:21] this okay is God by the spirit revealing
[1:16:25] to you something he's going to do or
[1:16:28] he's promised so faith is a revelation
[1:16:31] of the will of God then you see you hear
[1:16:34] the word and God reveals it to you that
[1:16:36] it is the truth and by Spirit revealed
[1:16:39] truth confirms your faith to God I love
[1:16:42] this other definition he says face power
[1:16:45] somebody say this with me face power
[1:16:47] brings to pass God's revealed
[1:16:52] Revelation the power of Faith brings to
[1:16:55] pass the revealed revelation of God can
[1:16:58] I say this to you faith is a revelation
[1:17:01] of God from God you don't work yourself
[1:17:05] up into faith if you ever have faith
[1:17:08] it's given to you by the grace of God
[1:17:10] see that's the real Revelation is that
[1:17:12] God keeps his word I'm turning a corner
[1:17:16] because this is the rapture generation
[1:17:19] and the only way you can take a Rapture
[1:17:21] is by Revelation now watch what a
[1:17:23] prophet says that's why the bride must
[1:17:26] have amen rapturing Faith now can I say
[1:17:29] this to you young people and don't ever

[1:34:26] of God can burn out everything in our
[1:34:28] lives that's unlike
[1:34:30] him come on church I'm just going to say
[1:34:33] what a prophet said y'all know brother
[1:34:35] BR wrote a church age book and in that
[1:34:37] church age book he wrote an audio letter
[1:34:38] to brother lale and he says these words
[1:34:41] remember says this in order to Proclaim
[1:34:43] this he has to send a prophet in order
[1:34:45] to inject this to make this real again
[1:34:48] and what's he doing to show the people
[1:34:50] the hour we're living in without a pro
[1:34:53] Prophet there is no reality in the
[1:34:55] church but if a prophet comes he's going
[1:34:58] to inject the word oh God back in the
[1:35:02] church he said because if they only see
[1:35:04] it in the hour pass then there's no hope
[1:35:06] for the church the church must see it in
[1:35:09] the present tense can I say this to you
[1:35:12] we can see what he did in
[1:35:14] Moses we can see what he did in David we
[1:35:17] can see what he did in shamgar we can
[1:35:19] see what he are you hearing me we can
[1:35:21] see what he did in Samson but that's a p

[1:41:04] morning we don't know the word
[1:41:07] Retreat can I pick up your thought
[1:41:09] brother Ron Heen we don't know the word
[1:41:11] Retreat I was I remember one time in
[1:41:13] school we was reading a history lesson
[1:41:15] about a battle and if IID have paid more
[1:41:16] attention I could give you some
[1:41:18] names but thank God for open book test I
[1:41:20] made it
[1:41:22] out inside joke you'll get that
[1:41:25] later I remember one time we had
[1:41:27] studying and while we were studying
[1:41:30] there was a War battle going on and
[1:41:32] there was something I never will forget
[1:41:34] they come to the general of the captain
[1:41:36] of whoever I I can't remember his name I
[1:41:38] wish I could I tried to find but they
[1:41:39] come to him and they said now listen we
[1:41:42] got to retreat and we got to devise a
[1:41:45] way to retreat and you know what he
[1:41:47] actually did he actually looked at him
[1:41:48] and laughed come
[1:41:50] on they shall narrowly look up on him
[1:41:53] and and laugh Isaiah
[1:41:55] 14 they they looked at him and laughed
[1:41:58] and you know what he said he said why
[1:42:01] would I waste my time making a way to
[1:42:03] retreat when I could be using that time
[1:42:06] to whip the
[1:42:12] enemy well glory to God somebody shout
[1:42:15] aloud in the house of God listen I ain't
[1:42:18] going to go in my study and try to find
[1:42:20] a different way to say what a prophet
[1:42:21] said I ain't going to come out here and
[1:42:23] tipto around quotes and scriptures to
[1:42:25] try to preach this message I have come
[1:42:27] here without the word Retreat and I'm
[1:42:30] going to stand here and say I Will Not
[1:42:32] Waste one second of pull pit time trying
[1:42:34] to come up with a way to retreat when I
[1:42:37] can draw my sword and you can draw your
[1:42:39] sword and we can whip some devils It's
[1:42:42] Time to whip the devil young people
[1:42:45] we're anointed to do it we're young
[1:42:50] soldiers my God is not dead my God is
[1:42:53] alive somebody say he's alive he's well
[1:42:58] he's here he's moving he's saving he's
[1:43:02] healing he's delivering he's giving the
[1:43:05] Holy Ghost he's defeating the enemy he's
[1:43:09] here he's here he's here here he's not
[1:43:12] in a
[1:43:13] tomb come on Church he's not in a grave
[1:43:17] he's here this morning in the form of
[1:43:19] his
[1:43:21] word now amen amen you give me five
[1:43:23] minutes and I'm going to tie this
[1:43:26] together you have to fight against that
[1:43:29] devil
[1:43:30] okay the message has come to you
[1:43:34] Mary okay now can I say this to you the
[1:43:37] message of the hour to Mary was a hard
[1:43:40] message prophet of God said like this he
[1:43:42] said it was something more outstanding
[1:43:44] for hard to her to believe than anything
[1:43:45] else but you all know that Mary was a
[1:43:48] prophetic
[1:43:50] woman and we are a prophetic class of
[1:43:53] people now watch this the word am I I'm
[1:43:56] hurrying the word the word had been
[1:44:00] spoken over Mary and said behold a
[1:44:02] virgin shall conceive and shall bring
[1:44:04] forth a son and shall call his name
[1:44:08] Emmanuel brother said
[1:44:11] 715 years before it happened Isaiah the
[1:44:14] prophet said that there's no doubt that
[1:44:17] everyone in that age thought their
[1:44:18] daughter would be that woman because
[1:44:20] Isaiah said it but here's the problem
[1:44:23] a father couldn't make his daughter that
[1:44:26] because God had already oh
[1:44:29] God God had already borrowed Mary's womb
[1:44:34] by
[1:44:36] predestination in other words Mary
[1:44:38] didn't make herself the Virgin to bring
[1:44:41] forth Jesus she was
[1:44:43] born she was born the Virgin to bring
[1:44:47] forth the promised child watch a prophet
[1:44:50] he said now she was in a horrible City
[1:44:52] but God chose her for a certain work now
[1:44:55] this is what astounds me brother Tim
[1:44:57] brother B says that God borrowed the
[1:45:00] womb of
[1:45:02] Mary he said to come into the world he
[1:45:05] had to borrow a womb right he said to
[1:45:08] leave the world he had to borrow a grave
[1:45:11] now now young people I know this is
[1:45:12] going to be hard to do okay but I want
[1:45:14] you to help me for a second I want you
[1:45:17] to wrap your mind around this thought
[1:45:19] that God
[1:45:21] borrowed
[1:45:23] he owned
[1:45:25] everything created everything but yet he
[1:45:28] still had to borrow the proud of God
[1:45:32] said now watch he said then again he
[1:45:33] must be the Seed of Abraham see and
[1:45:35] Abraham if you can catch it he had faith
[1:45:37] in God which United the spirit of God
[1:45:39] with the Flesh of man there's where the
[1:45:42] faith come there's why he could be the
[1:45:44] Abraham seed not all flesh but United
[1:45:46] the spirit and flesh together now here's
[1:45:48] where I'm going god making himself
[1:45:50] somebody say God making himself tearing
[1:45:53] out rooting out all
[1:45:56] evil and bringing into submission the
[1:46:02] flesh the dust he
[1:46:05] created to live with you as a
[1:46:10] partner God created Mary to carry his
[1:46:14] promised word seed son and then brought
[1:46:17] her flesh in the submission to do what
[1:46:20] he bored her to do what do you say
[1:46:22] brother Andrew I'm I'm saying when Mary
[1:46:23] and I'm closing on this point when Mary
[1:46:25] said these words the angel began to talk
[1:46:28] to her and he he he appeared like this
[1:46:30] and he says now good evening friends I
[1:46:32] mean he
[1:46:34] says I'm just having fun
[1:46:37] now he said good he said Mary you're a
[1:46:40] virgin a spouse to Joseph but what's in
[1:46:43] you is of the Holy Ghost now listen when
[1:46:45] he first started talking oh God when he
[1:46:48] first started talking Mary still had
[1:46:50] some flesh in her you know what she was
[1:46:52] saying she was saying how could this be
[1:46:55] seeing I know not a man but you know
[1:46:56] what I love before Mary had the question
[1:47:00] oh
[1:47:00] God the angel had the answer and the
[1:47:04] more that Mary submitted to the voice of
[1:47:07] the Angel oh God the more her flesh
[1:47:10] becomes so weak that she could no longer
[1:47:13] argue with the
[1:47:16] message when the angel started talking
[1:47:19] she had some questions she had some
[1:47:21] reasons why God couldn't use her she had
[1:47:23] some reasons and excuses but when God
[1:47:25] got done delivering the message the only
[1:47:28] thing she could say was be it unto me
[1:47:32] come on Church according to Thy Word in
[1:47:37] other words she oh God the Angel's
[1:47:40] message brought Mary's body into
[1:47:42] submission to the word of God to bring
[1:47:44] forth the promise what are you saying
[1:47:46] I'm saying the word borrow means to
[1:47:48] taking you something now oh God give me
[1:47:51] some Grace here taking you something
[1:47:52] something that belongs to someone else
[1:47:54] with the intention of returning it now
[1:47:57] listen when you borrow something you've
[1:47:59] got to take in the
[1:48:01] consideration the condition of it when
[1:48:04] it's
[1:48:05] returned so like brother Tim if I asked
[1:48:08] to borrow your pickup truck and you see
[1:48:10] my pickup truck and it's rusted out and
[1:48:12] ain't got good tires and food all in it
[1:48:14] and tore all the pieces you're going to
[1:48:15] be hesitant on loaning me your pickup
[1:48:18] truck because you know what kind of
[1:48:21] condition it could Poss possibly
[1:48:23] are you hearing me in other words
[1:48:25] there's a hesitancy of loaning something
[1:48:28] because you're worried about what kind
[1:48:30] of condition is going to come back in
[1:48:32] but can I say this God borrowed Mary's
[1:48:35] body oh God and she willfully gave it to
[1:48:39] him and the pr of God said he borrowed a
[1:48:40] womb that God used no more than any
[1:48:42] other woman see he might use your W your
[1:48:44] heart to declare his son if you would
[1:48:46] just let him do it now can I say this
[1:48:48] Mary was a part of God's law of
[1:48:51] presenting and yielding the Bible said
[1:48:55] amen that you would yield your members
[1:48:56] unto God as instruments of righteousness
[1:48:59] in other words you loan your members to
[1:49:02] God and God takes them and he uses them
[1:49:05] I love this I love this quote the pr of
[1:49:07] God said now flesh s now there's no need
[1:49:09] you pretty little thing you pretty
[1:49:10] little girl in school now don't you pay
[1:49:12] any attention to that old Holy Roller
[1:49:13] mother of yours or that fanatic father
[1:49:15] see you're the best looking girl in
[1:49:16] school you're the prettiest boy best
[1:49:18] looking boy Best Built you're the most
[1:49:20] popular is in the city and you yield
[1:49:22] your members to that and where do you
[1:49:24] come out at the end of the little horn
[1:49:27] every time but the law of the spirit of
[1:49:29] God in the heart overcomes the Flesh and
[1:49:34] makes the body obey what the heart says
[1:49:37] do can I say this to you brother said
[1:49:39] find out what God wants to use you for
[1:49:42] and then yield yourself to him making
[1:49:44] you the human instrumentality of God to
[1:49:48] bring forth or to accomplish the promise
[1:49:50] of his word I promise I'm closing on
[1:49:52] this Jesus came in the earth and he
[1:49:54] claimed a body right the word made flesh
[1:49:57] he has left the Earth in a Corporal body
[1:50:00] but I say this we got a prayer line
[1:50:01] coming tonight right amen I say this to
[1:50:03] you amen my Lord is not a dead God who
[1:50:07] cannot produce more
[1:50:10] testimonies because he is not here in a
[1:50:13] Corporal body does not mean that
[1:50:16] somebody cannot receive the message he
[1:50:19] sent believe that message and manifest
[1:50:22] the promise s said listen we are left as
[1:50:24] we understand to carry on his work that
[1:50:27] he has to accomplish his death at
[1:50:29] Calvary he was with us he went from come
[1:50:32] out of God in the world went from the
[1:50:33] world into God and come again in the
[1:50:36] form of the Holy Spirit and is with us
[1:50:39] in us to the end of the world carrying
[1:50:42] out in his church the same work he did
[1:50:45] when he was here on the earth what are
[1:50:46] you saying brother Andrew I'm saying
[1:50:48] when something is presented you must
[1:50:51] yield to it right
[1:50:53] do you know why an alcoholic becomes an
[1:50:55] alcoholic because somebody presented
[1:50:57] them
[1:50:58] alcohol and they yield it to the alcohol
[1:51:02] they gave their members to it and they
[1:51:04] let alcohol borrow their body and
[1:51:07] destroy it amen you know why somebody
[1:51:10] becomes a drug addict is because
[1:51:12] somewhere somebody presented some drugs
[1:51:15] now hear me and they yielded their body
[1:51:17] to those drugs and they become a drug
[1:51:21] addict can I say this to you you know
[1:51:23] why guys become sports stars it's
[1:51:26] because somewhere somebody presented
[1:51:28] them an
[1:51:29] opportunity to yield their body to the
[1:51:32] god of sports come on now and they'll go
[1:51:36] out there and blow their knees break
[1:51:37] their backs bust their necks come on I'm
[1:51:40] preaching to you now the god of sports
[1:51:43] has borrowed their body and is
[1:51:46] destroying it and you know what he's
[1:51:47] going to do he's going to use it use it
[1:51:49] use it use it use it and when he can't
[1:51:51] use it no more he's going to hand it
[1:51:53] back to
[1:51:55] him he borrowed it but he didn't take
[1:51:58] into consideration the condition it
[1:52:00] would be in when he returned it oh god
[1:52:03] brother Ron but when God borrowed
