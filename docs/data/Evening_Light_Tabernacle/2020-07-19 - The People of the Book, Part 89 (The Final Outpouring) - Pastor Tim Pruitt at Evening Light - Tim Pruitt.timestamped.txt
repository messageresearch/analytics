[42:21] us now as we go through in this service
[42:24] today in Jesus name
[42:27] amen amen praise the Lord man I'm gonna
[42:32] let you be seated just for a moment
[42:34] we're going to sing a song here that I
[42:38] want to teach you here in just a minute
[42:41] it's been one that I'm it's a it's an
[42:45] old hymn about a hundred years old
[42:46] really when the revelation of the truths
[42:49] of the Godhead began to hit it was not
[42:51] the full truth but it was truth as it
[42:55] was in its infancy and of course God
[42:57] gave us a greater expansion of
[42:59] revelation and understanding and so we
[43:04] you know we know that the greatest of
[43:07] all revelations is the supreme deity of
[43:09] our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[43:12] this microphone better quit saying hey
[43:15] man I I'd like to do my own amen and
[43:20] praise the Lord all right there there is
[43:24] no greater revelation in the revelation
[43:28] of Jesus Christ is us song the
[43:30] revelation of the Bride of Christ and
[43:32] any other unfolding revelation of the
[43:35] church ages of seals and so forth and
[43:37] it's all encapsulated in the person in
[43:41] Christ Jesus because it is a revelation
[43:43] of him and you can't get to first base
[43:47] unless you believe in the supreme deity
[43:49] of our Lord Jesus Christ and then y'all
[43:52] can give me just a little more sound up
[43:54] here - now we don't believe that Jesus
[43:57] was his own father but we but rather he
[44:01] was a body that God created to dwell in
[44:04] so the father could dwell in the son so
[44:07] he was only a son in that God was only a
[44:11] son in that he he made a body to come
[44:14] and dwell in and this condescending was
[44:17] for a further purpose so that in the Sun
[44:20] God could pay for our sins and dust
[44:22] redeem our flesh so he could further
[44:25] condescend and dwell in us bringing many
[44:28] sons to him selves you know the
[44:30] scripture begins Genesis 1:1 in the
[44:33] beginning God the Gospels of in the book
[44:37] of st. John it begins with in the
[44:39] beginning was the
[44:40] word and revelation 1:1 begins like this
[44:44] the revelation of Jesus Christ because
[44:46] Jesus is the revelation of God and
[44:50] brother Branham would tell us in the
[44:52] Patmos vision the first thing you got to
[44:54] know is that he is not a prophet he's
[44:57] not a junior God he's not a secondary
[44:59] God He is God little later in the same
[45:03] sermon he was sir he refers to John
[45:06] beingness in the spirit on the Lord's
[45:08] Day here's a trumpet and he turns to
[45:11] look and he says I'm Alpha know Megan he
[45:13] goes on to comment the greatest of all
[45:17] revelations is the deity the supreme
[45:21] deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you can't
[45:25] get the first base until you believe
[45:27] that that's what Peter said repent and
[45:29] then see the deity and so um be baptized
[45:33] in the name of Jesus Christ for
[45:35] remission of your sins and then you're
[45:37] ready to go in the spirit so the first
[45:40] thing you got to know is the deity of
[45:42] Christ I am Alpha and Omega yeah I'm
[45:48] Alpha and Omega and I there is no more
[45:53] but me I was at the beginning I'll be at
[45:55] the he that was which is and shall come
[46:00] the Almighty think of that that's what
[46:02] the trumpet said alright so the first of
[46:05] all revelations is the supreme deity of
[46:08] Jesus Christ you must know who he is
[46:11] when you hear the voice who is he I'm
[46:14] the first and the last time the supreme
[46:16] one I'm the Almighty how many believes
[46:18] that about our Lord Jesus Christ there's
[46:20] no salvation in any other name but in
[46:23] the name of Jesus Christ praise the Lord
[46:26] and then we're gonna be here for a while
[46:28] they done took my coat off praise God
[46:32] hey man hey man well hallelujah make
[46:37] yourself comfortable
[46:38] hey man we're just looking to the Lord
[46:41] today again and krita's see but brother
[46:44] branham explained the main revelation
[46:46] always is who Jesus Christ is the book
[46:49] of Revelation which is the revelation of
[46:51] Jesus Christ opens with the very thing
[46:54] show the supreme deity of Jesus Christ
[46:57] I'm he that was which is and shall come
[47:00] the Almighty the first of all
[47:02] revelations and then brother Branham and
[47:05] innocence arise on the son he takes a
[47:07] picture of the cloud and he turns it two
[47:09] to the right and he says um just turn
[47:12] the picture the way you're supposed to
[47:14] be he is supreme judge there is none
[47:17] other but him and that's the perfect
[47:19] identification again of this vindication
[47:22] that this message is truth this is the
[47:24] truth it is true making him not a third
[47:27] person but the only person

[51:44] too sister Sharon and your guests Oh
[51:46] Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 we're going
[51:49] to read from today and when the day of
[51:54] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[51:58] with one Accord in one place and
[52:00] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[52:02] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[52:05] filled all the house where they were
[52:06] sitting and there appeared unto them
[52:09] cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat
[52:12] upon each of them and then they were all
[52:16] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[52:18] speak with other tongues as the Spirit
[52:20] gave them utterance and there were
[52:23] dwelling in Jerusalem Jews devout devout
[52:26] men out of every nation under heaven and
[52:30] now when this was noised abroad the
[52:32] multitude came together and were
[52:33] confounded because that every man heard
[52:36] them speak in the his own language and
[52:38] they were all amazed and marvelled
[52:40] saying one to another the whole are not
[52:43] all these which speak galilaeans
[52:45] now here we ever man in our own tongue
[52:48] wherein we were born parthians and medes
[52:52] and elamites and dwellers and Methos so
[52:55] potamia
[52:56] and in Judea and Cappadocia and Pontius
[52:59] an Asian and area and Pamphylia
[53:03] in Egypt and in the part
[53:05] some Libya about serene and strangers of
[53:09] Rome Jews and proselytes Crete's and
[53:11] Arabians we do hear them speak in our
[53:14] tongues the wonderful works of God and
[53:18] they were all amazed and were in doubt
[53:21] saying one to another what meaneth s
[53:24] others said these men are full of new
[53:26] wine but Peter standing up with the
[53:29] eleven lifted up his voice and said unto
[53:32] them you men are Gd and all ye that
[53:34] dwell in Jerusalem be thou known unto
[53:36] you and hearken to my words but these
[53:38] are not drunken as you suppose see and
[53:40] it is but the third hour of the day but
[53:43] this is that which was spoken by the
[53:44] Prophet Joel and it should come to pass
[53:46] in the last days saith God I would pour
[53:49] out my spirit upon all flesh and your
[53:52] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[53:54] and your young men shall see visions and
[53:56] your old men shall dream dreams and on
[53:59] my servants and on my friend maidens
[54:01] I will pour out in those days of my
[54:03] spirits and they shall prophesy and I
[54:07] will show wonders in heaven above and
[54:09] signs in the earth beneath and blood and
[54:12] fire and vapor of smoke and the Sun
[54:14] shall be turned to darkness the moon
[54:16] into blood before the great and terrible
[54:18] day and notable day of the Lord shall
[54:21] come and it should come to pass that
[54:23] whosoever should call on the name of the
[54:25] Lord shall be saved you men of Israel
[54:27] hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man
[54:31] approved of God among you by miracles
[54:33] and wonders and signs which God did by
[54:38] him in the midst of you as you know also
[54:41] yourself father bless the reading of
[54:44] your word now in Jesus name Amen god
[54:46] bless you can be seated the other
[54:50] morning about three o'clock I was woken
[54:55] suddenly and began to write some notes
[54:58] for this sermon de stood a and wrote
[55:02] down the title of what I'm speaking on
[55:04] this morning of the final outpouring now
[55:08] we are living in the fulfillment of
[55:10] scriptures and the final out porn upon
[55:13] the Gentiles before the rapture of
[55:15] course there will be a great move of God
[55:19] the Jews 144,000 with their two
[55:21] witnesses and Moses and Elijah those are
[55:24] not Gentile prophets those are Jewish
[55:26] prophets and I know there are those who
[55:31] believe that everything that can be
[55:33] poured out has already been poured out
[55:36] so they already put it all in the past
[55:39] and some would say brother Tim we
[55:41] already have the mysteries revealed and
[55:44] the last sign has been given so what
[55:48] more could be done sure I am but I want
[55:52] just to say to you though we agree that
[55:54] God has done some wonderful things in
[55:57] this generation don't put everything in
[55:59] the past
[56:01] amen because one may protest but Christ
[56:06] has already come and only in the sense
[56:09] he came in his word to a prophet and in
[56:12] that farm he has come with a shout but
[56:16] yet he is also here today present tense
[56:19] and he's here in bride farm we're gonna
[56:23] speak a little bit about that this
[56:24] morning and again he's coming again for
[56:27] us to meet him in the air don't forget
[56:30] that coming is still in the future
[56:32] it's what believers believe and the
[56:35] seventh seal of mysteries that it was
[56:38] not God closing of the book it was to
[56:41] open the book the book that had been
[56:44] closed the secrets that had been shut
[56:47] away that had been reserved for the end
[56:50] time God saw that it was opened to us in
[56:54] this day so it was not the closing of
[56:57] the book it was the opening of the book
[56:59] it was to show us our inheritance so
[57:02] that we could claim every redemptive
[57:05] right for ourselves and I want to say
[57:08] today is a day of the fullness where the
[57:12] bride will fulfill the New Testament um
[57:16] as brother Branham would tell us about
[57:19] the masterpiece and how that you know he
[57:23] described Michelangelo as he worked upon
[57:26] that masterpiece and then he struck it
[57:29] and said speak as he looked there at
[57:32] creation or are his his art work that he
[57:37] had done and he hit him upon the leg
[57:39] with his malady and it was so real to
[57:42] him that he said speech and and again a
[57:46] piece went off of him and to some that
[57:51] flawed the masterpiece but in brother
[57:53] branham's mind it made it the
[57:56] masterpiece because it was so real to
[58:00] the artist till till he could see he had
[58:04] seen it step out of the rock the many
[58:07] days that he had taken just a
[58:10] nondescript
[58:11] block of stone and worked and worked the
[58:13] hours and years that he had toiled and
[58:16] now his vision was materialized before
[58:19] him and God has also had a vision and
[58:23] he's also had a plan and God's also been
[58:25] working down to the ages and through the
[58:28] ages he brought it up where that he
[58:31] brought it to the masterpiece of the Old
[58:34] Testament where Jesus was the fullness
[58:37] of all the prophets he would start with
[58:40] the base and begin with working on the
[58:44] base and he would start with Abraham the
[58:46] faith of Abraham and the the grace that
[58:49] are they loved that was shown in Isaac
[58:52] and then the Grace and Jacob and
[58:53] perfection and Joseph so when it would
[58:56] go all the way from faith to perfection
[58:59] and then the building up through the
[59:02] prophets and all of that until it
[59:04] finally was God made manifest among us
[59:08] till we could say that it was all in him
[59:12] the wisdom of Solomon the Psalms of
[59:15] David the prophecies of Isaiah then the
[59:19] scriptures in Jeremiah
[59:20] they're all the different ones that had
[59:23] prophesied of him was now made manifest
[59:26] and out of the vision showed what God
[59:31] had in his mind to bring one in his own
[59:34] image but what made it a masterpiece was
[59:39] he struck at at Calvary
[59:42] and out of Calvary there was another
[59:45] piece come out of him the water the
[59:48] blood and the spirit that poured out
[59:51] from iam at Calvary and so it would be
[59:55] out of this that God would make him
[59:58] another masterpiece and this masterpiece
[1:00:01] would fulfill the New Testament and God
[1:00:06] has been working up on this masterpiece
[1:00:09] down to the ages somebody help me preach
[1:00:12] now a man and it looked like him many
[1:00:15] times that it would go down into failure
[1:00:18] and he would have to abandon the plan
[1:00:20] but he brought it out and brought it to
[1:00:23] justification with Luther and
[1:00:24] sanctification to Wesleyan and the
[1:00:27] ending of the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:29] and the gifts wind under Pentecost and
[1:00:33] finally he comes into perfection word
[1:00:36] that the bride becomes him bother me the
[1:00:39] embody me of all the the word that has
[1:00:43] been spoken she will be the
[1:00:45] justification that Luther preached in
[1:00:48] his perfection she will be the
[1:00:51] segregation that Wesley preached but in
[1:00:53] his perfection she will be exactly what
[1:00:56] this Zeus's three people preach but in
[1:00:59] his perfection and man we are here in
[1:01:02] the time of the perfection and now his
[1:01:06] bride will fulfill everything that's in
[1:01:09] the New Testament because there is
[1:01:12] another masterpiece in the making a man
[1:01:16] until finally he brings her forth and
[1:01:19] brings her also in speaking terms and a
[1:01:23] resurrection is called and our body
[1:01:26] changed and we moved from this mortal
[1:01:28] back in day immortality and that's the
[1:01:31] age that we're living in all the New
[1:01:36] Testament brother Branham would tell us
[1:01:38] in the message Shalom all the New
[1:01:40] Testament speaks of this our Jesus
[1:01:42] Christ speaks of this hour
[1:01:44] so then again you see it's not about
[1:01:49] denominations or how many members
[1:01:52] it's not the nicest buildings or the
[1:01:55] greatest places that we take God for
[1:01:58] what he's given us and it's neither is
[1:02:01] it about small cliques our little secret
[1:02:05] groups our big secret groups who who are
[1:02:09] exclusive and ma'am but it what it's
[1:02:13] about is God revealing himself in Christ
[1:02:17] bringing the fullness of all the word
[1:02:19] and encapsulating it in Christ and in
[1:02:23] Christ pouring out his spirit until it
[1:02:26] brings the fullness of God in his bride
[1:02:30] just as Jesus was the fullness of the
[1:02:33] Godhead so God is also bringing the
[1:02:36] fullness of the Godhead the word back
[1:02:39] into manifestation in Christ some
[1:02:43] mystery when brother Branham said when I
[1:02:45] think of this I just see denominations
[1:02:48] pass out the scene a man when I see
[1:02:52] God's great purpose revealing himself
[1:02:54] and having to first reveal himself in
[1:02:56] Christ the fullness of the Godhead
[1:02:59] bodily and then to bring that fullness
[1:03:02] of the Godhead bodily into a people that
[1:03:07] he could have the preeminence the
[1:03:09] oversight the leading somebody with me
[1:03:12] now so you see the very same thing he
[1:03:14] brought it up to the fullness to the
[1:03:17] fullness of the Godhead was in a body
[1:03:19] and that body was Jesus but now he also
[1:03:22] brings it up from the ages until where
[1:03:25] he came comes again to cap out all the
[1:03:28] ages to finish all the ages with God
[1:03:31] manifests in in his fullness in a body
[1:03:34] but not one single person but in a
[1:03:38] multiply the multiple to body of Jesus
[1:03:42] Christ
[1:03:43] a man so he could have the preeminence
[1:03:47] the oversight the leading brother
[1:03:51] branham again in crisis of mystery I'm
[1:03:52] gonna read several of these from Christ
[1:03:54] some mystery God expressed in Jesus
[1:03:57] Christ who is both Father Son and Holy
[1:04:01] Ghost the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:04:04] now how many's ready for the now we can

[1:04:38] reconciling the world to himself are you
[1:04:41] with me now so again let me go let me
[1:04:44] quote it again God expressed in Jesus
[1:04:47] Christ who is both Father Son and Holy
[1:04:50] Ghost the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:04:54] now hey now hey my brother Johnny beat
[1:05:01] you to it see you needed to say now I
[1:05:04] want you to look over to your neighbor
[1:05:07] and just and just say it this is for now
[1:05:09] this is what to happen now that happened
[1:05:12] yesterday all the word was fulfilled in
[1:05:15] Jesus of the Old Testament right now we
[1:05:17] are coming out to another fulfillment
[1:05:20] now the complete fullness of the Godhead
[1:05:24] bodily 12 in his church the preeminence
[1:05:29] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:05:32] and all Christ was has been poured in
[1:05:34] the church the believers hallelujah now
[1:05:40] now the complete fullness of the Godhead
[1:05:44] bodily all the word all of the word
[1:05:49] dwells in the body of his bride
[1:05:54] hallelujah amen
[1:05:56] again he would tell us he sanctified
[1:06:00] with his spirit in his blood of church
[1:06:02] that he might make every promise in this
[1:06:05] last day being revealed see he could go
[1:06:09] back and pick up what these other
[1:06:10] fellows has left off in the last days by
[1:06:13] His Holy Spirit and reveal all the
[1:06:15] mysteries of the seven seals
[1:06:17] see he's expressing his self that's his
[1:06:20] purpose that's why I that's the second
[1:06:23] fold of his threefold manifestation
[1:06:24] first to express himself in Christ then
[1:06:27] express himself through the church and
[1:06:30] then the same thing Christ was a word
[1:06:32] and when the crowd and the church
[1:06:34] becomes the word when it lets the word
[1:06:38] go through them and man we become the
[1:06:42] word that speaks of healing when it goes
[1:06:45] through us and brings healing hey man we
[1:06:49] express the word of casting out Devils
[1:06:52] when we test our devils and it flows
[1:06:55] through us and man when we live a holy
[1:06:59] life amen it's a word flowing through us
[1:07:02] what God wants of the people in this
[1:07:05] last day are you with me now so the same
[1:07:09] thing as he says I'm he said and the
[1:07:12] church with the Christ was the word in
[1:07:14] the church becomes a word and when it
[1:07:17] lets the word go through them but when
[1:07:22] they accept a hybrid denomination how
[1:07:24] can the word go through it it's grounded
[1:07:27] because it calls us a shorten it blows
[1:07:29] of you fuse but when the current is
[1:07:32] flowing flowing freely the Word of God
[1:07:35] and expresses itself the works that I do
[1:07:40] so you do also and then the last days it
[1:07:44] shall come to pass behold I send you
[1:07:47] Elijah the prophet has not done that
[1:07:51] then what about the rest of it and he
[1:07:54] shall turn the hearts of the children
[1:07:56] back to the faith of the fathers if sure
[1:08:01] and brother Branham was Elijah a man as
[1:08:05] sure as he was Elijah even so just as
[1:08:08] sure your hearts come by a message been
[1:08:13] turned back to the faith of the fathers
[1:08:17] a mound and then there in that time of
[1:08:23] restoration there would come a time
[1:08:25] forth Oh hallelujah
[1:08:28] I believe we're in that terminal
[1:08:30] restoration there would come a time for
[1:08:33] us when he could express himself in the
[1:08:36] fullness of his Godhead deity through
[1:08:40] his church have preeminence in his
[1:08:42] church oh my what the anointed man that
[1:08:48] was Jesus 2,000 years ago now we come to
[1:08:54] this important word again now people
[1:08:57] want to know what's not doing today
[1:08:59] what's the promise for the day now can
[1:09:03] you say now
[1:09:04] now what's this now the anointed people
[1:09:09] it was the anointed man
[1:09:13] but now the anointed people a man to
[1:09:21] bring back the anointed bride and
[1:09:23] bridegroom you see there's gotta be
[1:09:27] somebody you match him that he can say
[1:09:31] the bone of my bone and flesh of my
[1:09:33] flesh and life for my life and power my
[1:09:35] power
[1:09:36] she's him anointed by why accepting what
[1:09:42] he turned down that's the word and Adam
[1:09:45] by coming back with the anointing of the
[1:09:48] word because he said my word his spirit
[1:09:50] she anointed with the word what he
[1:09:53] turned down he comes back and we accept
[1:09:57] do you realize where we're standing then
[1:09:59] we're standing on the edge of Eden
[1:10:06] I don't live here that's exactly right
[1:10:09] because we're right back to the point to
[1:10:12] accept what Eve turned down and we
[1:10:15] accept a man now the last sound the last
[1:10:21] time you said brother Tim we've received
[1:10:23] our last sign let's talk about the last
[1:10:25] sign for a moment the last sign was God
[1:10:28] in human flesh
[1:10:29] a man we often think of the discernment
[1:10:33] being the last sign it is not the bride
[1:10:37] of Jesus Christ years the last sigh now
[1:10:44] brother madam tells us in in crisis a
[1:10:48] mystery the church his church will be
[1:10:50] there without spot or wrinkle she gonna
[1:10:53] stand there in the splendor of him his
[1:10:55] word made manifest she'll be a token
[1:10:59] that's a sign to the world the bride is
[1:11:08] the last sign I want you to get this you
[1:11:13] are the last sign brother Branham listen
[1:11:18] here included brother Branham but you
[1:11:20] are the last sign in temporal Florida
[1:11:24] and the trial brother Branham said I
[1:11:25] challenge you to believe that Jesus
[1:11:27] Christ is revealed in the form of the
[1:11:29] Son of Man in human flesh through the
[1:11:32] bride's body so this is where the son of
[1:11:36] man the word the complete Word of God is
[1:11:38] going to be revealed it's through the
[1:11:39] bride's body again in service we would
[1:11:42] seek Jesus he said it and and there was
[1:11:46] one to the called out elected church
[1:11:48] that was showing the sign that God was
[1:11:51] in flesh Jesus was God in question if
[1:11:55] Jesus is in you tonight it is still God
[1:11:57] manifests himself in the last days the
[1:11:59] Son of Man revealing himself in his
[1:12:01] church the human flesh making himself
[1:12:04] known you see you got you get it God
[1:12:07] down here in his church making himself a
[1:12:10] getting the word the son of man being
[1:12:11] revealed in the last days as it was in

[1:12:20] now in again it becometh us to fulfill
[1:12:24] all righteousness this is a actually 61
[1:12:28] sermon but I thought it was noteworthy
[1:12:32] because brother Branham was preaching on
[1:12:34] where we stand we got to fulfill all
[1:12:37] righteousness all the word all the word
[1:12:41] that spoke of a bride in this hour
[1:12:43] alright so he said the Holy Ghost here

[1:30:48] Prophet women that wear long hair
[1:30:51] Nazarite to prove their separated
[1:30:54] themselves from the world a man for the
[1:30:56] word of God not a short wearing painted
[1:30:59] face Jezebel calling themselves
[1:31:01] Christian no sir man no so we see
[1:31:04] Washington to stand for a denomination
[1:31:06] and hold on their coattails ISM Caesar
[1:31:09] or Herod instead of spending for the
[1:31:11] Word of God but God's got loyal people
[1:31:15] genuine flock of God who don't care what
[1:31:19] the world says they believe that Jesus
[1:31:21] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:31:24] forever
[1:31:26] she's a super sign to the world you'd
[1:31:33] already been seen in the vision I saw in
[1:31:35] that vision those clean face godly
[1:31:38] dressed women from all over the world
[1:31:41] from every nation Martin and tuned

[1:31:57] God's got a lawyer genuine people
[1:32:01] Alleluia i standing the other day in LSU
[1:32:13] hospital little girl from the physical
[1:32:17] therapy come in see one know about
[1:32:22] Karen's hair was it long because of
[1:32:26] because of something religious yeah cuz
[1:32:30] we believe the Bible that's right well
[1:32:34] our church used to believe that some of
[1:32:37] the older ones still do but you know she
[1:32:40] went on to explain to me she says you
[1:32:43] know I'm but now our church does not
[1:32:47] follow the Old Testament customs I said
[1:32:52] oh I said well it might interest you to
[1:32:55] know that hair is not an Old Testament
[1:32:57] custom it's something that was mandated
[1:33:02] by the Apostle Paul in 1st Corinthians
[1:33:04] 11 and he said we have no other custom
[1:33:10] than this and I said it's what the
[1:33:13] Church of Jesus Christ does if they
[1:33:15] follow the Bible oh she said I didn't
[1:33:19] know that she does now
[1:33:24] hallelujah hey man hey man you know
[1:33:29] again you know brother brother branham
[1:33:31] talks about the the blood of Jesus how
[1:33:37] he must be so careful about the blood I
[1:33:39] want to just deal with this for a second
[1:33:41] cuz it has to do with my subject and he
[1:33:44] talked about how a man like when
[1:33:46] Dillinger was killed in Chicago or one
[1:33:50] of the villains your outfit was killed
[1:33:52] and he's shot in the street you know
[1:33:56] dunkers by the hundreds lined up to see
[1:33:59] this notorious criminal they used to do
[1:34:02] that those of you know about Bonnie and
[1:34:04] Clyde they paraded their bodies all
[1:34:07] through the you know this area you know
[1:34:09] showing their trophies of Bonnie and
[1:34:12] Clyde and they're riddled car and all of
[1:34:14] that tracks hundreds gawkers but he said
[1:34:20] the blood spread up the street and and
[1:34:23] people were suspicious of that they
[1:34:25] would they wouldn't step on their fellow
[1:34:27] man's blood but then he says they'll
[1:34:31] walk right through the blood of Jesus
[1:34:33] Christ
[1:34:34] this whole saying is through fools well
[1:34:37] what would hotmail shoes where angels
[1:34:40] fear to try that's right
[1:34:41] they'll walk right over it and say the
[1:34:45] days of miracles are past hmm that was
[1:34:51] all right for the apostles but not for
[1:34:53] us oh my how can you say you're tramping
[1:34:57] under the foot the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:00] wherewith you are sanctified with oh my
[1:35:02] think of it the blood on your hands now
[1:35:07] we wouldn't today daresay the days of
[1:35:10] miracles are past although that's what
[1:35:13] many actually believe we know the word
[1:35:17] would condemn us for that
[1:35:19] so Satan uses another tactic we would
[1:35:24] just say its first and second pull
[1:35:27] preaching now some of you that's not
[1:35:32] acquainted with the message you're
[1:35:34] wondering you got a big question mark
[1:35:35] you'll catch on
[1:35:38] or they would say well we just don't
[1:35:41] made your own a miner yet it's only a
[1:35:46] minor when is compared to the healing of
[1:35:49] the soul a mass it's minor in compared
[1:35:53] to salvation but 80% of Jesus ministry
[1:35:57] was healing the sick that's pretty major
[1:36:01] hey man the principle work of the church
[1:36:05] should be casting out Devils a man and
[1:36:12] and now you see but he says you're
[1:36:15] trampling on the blood when you deny
[1:36:19] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:36:21] forever when the emphasis is no longer
[1:36:24] there in the church I'm gonna find this
[1:36:29] little quote 8 oh yeah right here
[1:36:31] perfect faith this is you know it kills
[1:36:37] me today if you preach something you can
[1:36:41] read something before the seals well
[1:36:42] that was before the seals so we don't
[1:36:44] you know out that goes that that
[1:36:45] minimizes that so you preach it after
[1:36:48] the seals well then what was sad in
[1:36:51] jeffersonville or was dad evangelistic
[1:36:53] sermon out there like brother Brandon
[1:36:56] would preach something different you
[1:37:01] know my poor old mother she was a
[1:37:02] sweetheart but I'll tell you what you
[1:37:06] know if she there was something she
[1:37:08] didn't want to accept her of what
[1:37:10] brother branham said she just said well
[1:37:12] he just said that to throw people off to
[1:37:14] deceive him so they wouldn't believe and
[1:37:16] just throw him off she said that to me
[1:37:19] one time it was the wrong person to say
[1:37:21] that I said well then I quit following
[1:37:23] them every day that today I I won't
[1:37:25] nothing do with that man who would
[1:37:27] deliberately lie to me to throw me off
[1:37:30] and leave my soul to hell that's
[1:37:34] nonsense
[1:37:35] man but let me just say this in you know
[1:37:39] again in perfect faith it makes all the
[1:37:41] qualification is 63 August 25 and it's
[1:37:45] in Jeffersonville
[1:37:49] meet all the qualifications and I
[1:37:52] thought being here twice today it should
[1:37:54] be then we should dedicate one service
[1:37:56] for a prayer for the sick
[1:37:57] I believe in healing the sick I believe
[1:38:01] it's a Bible command
[1:38:03] we cannot preach that without the Full
[1:38:05] Gospel without including that so you
[1:38:09] cannot preach the full gospel without
[1:38:13] including divine healing it's not very
[1:38:20] minor after all a man perfect faith
[1:38:26] brother Branham says now that dental
[1:38:30] Gatien of a scripture Christian these
[1:38:32] words said Jesus these signs shall
[1:38:35] follow them that believe now how can you
[1:38:36] call yourself a believer of people and
[1:38:39] deny those words how can you call
[1:38:40] yourself a believer in deny any of this
[1:38:42] word you can't do it you're not a
[1:38:45] believer therefore signs can't follow
[1:38:47] because you just can't see it can't you
[1:38:50] just accept what you want to believe and
[1:38:52] let the rest of you just don't believe
[1:38:54] it but you've got to take the whole
[1:38:56] thing and believe it and when you truly
[1:38:58] believe not make believe but really
[1:39:01] believe then these signs follow them
[1:39:04] that believe that gives a pretty good
[1:39:09] qualification amen brother Branham said
[1:39:16] again that's how to identify you if you
[1:39:19] say you're Christian the identification
[1:39:21] or a Christian the Bible Christian is
[1:39:24] not worked in you then there's something
[1:39:25] wrong these signs shall follow them that
[1:39:27] believe yes or not maybe they're weird
[1:39:29] they will they will if we can only
[1:39:32] realize he's here with us the same
[1:39:34] yesterday today and forever law I am
[1:39:37] with you always I'll never leave you not
[1:39:39] forsake you I'm here I'm with you to the
[1:39:42] end of the world 24th chapter I'll never
[1:39:45] leave you here again he said I'll never
[1:39:48] leave you or forsake you I'm just
[1:39:49] looking at scriptures I wrote down
[1:39:51] concerning how can we be sure by his
[1:39:53] proven word he's not waiting for you to
[1:39:55] call him
[1:39:57] seems to be proved so let us go and
[1:40:01] awake Christ in our lives how do you
[1:40:05] awake Christ by believing his work faith
[1:40:10] brings him on the scene that's what
[1:40:12] brings him on the scene faith then call
[1:40:14] him to confirm by his word and don't
[1:40:17] doubt and fear don't do that
[1:40:19] um just believe him as it's written and
[1:40:22] let it let it be done and God will prove
[1:40:24] to you that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:40:26] yesterday today and forever
[1:40:29] we worship an invisible God hallelujah
[1:40:33] now let's just let's just go beyond this
[1:40:41] others will say well we're not second
[1:40:45] Paul or first Paul we're third pull well
[1:40:49] if you're in the third pull why aren't
[1:40:51] you speaking the word why aren't you
[1:40:55] moving mountains in the third Pulis
[1:40:58] creation in the third pull is
[1:41:01] resurrection power in the rail and the
[1:41:04] third pole is healing in the third pull
[1:41:08] is control of situations around you in
[1:41:10] the third polar salvation for children
[1:41:16] by man the word this word is to take the
[1:41:21] immaturity out of us and give us a holy
[1:41:24] boldness I've got some things to say
[1:41:28] about that this morning in the adoption
[1:41:30] message brother Menendez may choke you
[1:41:32] to death you know that men that are sons
[1:41:35] of God are a mature God's how many knew
[1:41:39] that how many know season said so did
[1:41:42] not the law say you know except your
[1:41:43] gods if you call them gods your God said
[1:41:46] in Genesis 2 there were gods because
[1:41:47] they had full domain over the Dominion
[1:41:50] of the world he gave him dominion over
[1:41:51] all things and he lost his conscience
[1:41:54] he lost his sonship he lost his domain a
[1:41:59] man but then Satan took it over but
[1:42:02] brother we are waiting for the
[1:42:04] manifestations of the sons of God who
[1:42:06] will come back and take it over again
[1:42:09] waiting for the
[1:42:10] there's a time when the pyramid gets
[1:42:12] under the top anybody understand that
[1:42:16] where are we
[1:42:18] we're not at the bottom and network
[1:42:20] club's been building it come on we're at
[1:42:24] the top you know ain't built a pyramid
[1:42:33] that right
[1:42:34] you know the enix Pyramid was not a tomb
[1:42:39] men copied it made tombs out of it
[1:42:43] that's exactly what has happened you
[1:42:45] know the original the original Church
[1:42:48] was not a tomb its copies of the
[1:42:52] original Church that become tombs hey
[1:42:55] man the original meaning of pyramid was
[1:42:58] a place of Ascension come on where are
[1:43:03] we in the pyramid we have come to the
[1:43:05] top to the place of Ascension director
[1:43:09] time are you with me waiting for the
[1:43:12] bowl is a time when the pyramid gets
[1:43:14] into the top when the full sons of God
[1:43:17] will be manifested when the power God
[1:43:20] will walk out hallelujah and will take
[1:43:23] every Power that Satan's got away from
[1:43:25] him
[1:43:38] why we ought to be holding ourselves
[1:43:40] steady and letting God feel every fiber
[1:43:42] of our being because he said that's what
[1:43:45] the dynamics is is a refilling of the
[1:43:47] Holy Ghost
[1:43:50] hey ma'am this is where we're at he said
[1:43:55] it's a refilling of the Holy Ghost and
[1:43:58] we'd say he is a dynamics and we just
[1:44:00] become members of the Machine of his
[1:44:02] body forming ourselves in His image
[1:44:04] uniting himself with us or his work and
[1:44:07] his love gifts as he hands them to us
[1:44:08] just before the wedding supper and we're
[1:44:11] waiting watching for that the big
[1:44:13] churches to be united that dynamics of
[1:44:16] this church will be a refilling of the
[1:44:17] Holy Spirit that we have worked in a
[1:44:20] small measure while they had stoned that
[1:44:22] Jesus Christ is coming down to unite
[1:44:24] with the body but when that head and
[1:44:26] body heights together the full power the
[1:44:28] Holy Ghost a razor up just exactly like
[1:44:30] that even the dead that's in Christ for
[1:44:32] hundreds of years will rise in the
[1:44:34] beauty of his holiness and take a flight
[1:44:35] to the skies so notice he's pouring out
[1:44:40] his are uniting with us when his works
[1:44:44] with his love gifts as he hands him to
[1:44:47] us let's stop here just a minute love
[1:44:49] gifts the message oneness he tells about
[1:44:53] a church engaged to Christ for a wedding
[1:44:57] and the wedding in this type he said has
[1:44:59] not been performed yet it'll be at the
[1:45:03] wedding supper of the Lamb so we he said
[1:45:07] the church is now engaged like a man is
[1:45:10] engaged to see now Oh engaged his wife
[1:45:14] and what does he do when they're engaged
[1:45:17] now remember he slipped the wedding band
[1:45:20] to beat predestinated unmerited grace on
[1:45:23] you before the foundation of the world
[1:45:25] but you just now found out about it God
[1:45:28] chose you he's just bestowing all kinds
[1:45:32] of things sending her presents making
[1:45:36] her feel good a man and that's what
[1:45:40] Christ is doing to his church he's
[1:45:43] sending us gifts of the Spirit now how
[1:45:45] can you be engaged in when you are
[1:45:47] denying
[1:45:48] gifts exist it's the very love tokens
[1:45:52] it's God's token to the church Jesus
[1:45:54] sent so these signs have followed them
[1:45:56] that believe now keep those things in
[1:45:59] mind the church must believe every word
[1:46:01] every promise every out and claim it for
[1:46:04] themselves and exercise themselves in it
[1:46:07] if I was engaged to a girl and I was a
[1:46:11] single man and I would Cindy be send her
[1:46:13] something engagement ring she wouldn't
[1:46:15] worry it show she doesn't believe me she
[1:46:18] doesn't want to be my bride and if
[1:46:20] Christ sends his church the gifts that
[1:46:22] he's promised and they refuse them and
[1:46:24] say they're not so they don't want to be
[1:46:26] the Bride of Christ they're its
[1:46:28] thousands some other lover not to Christ
[1:46:30] the bridegroom
[1:46:31] so the real church keeps the promise and
[1:46:34] keeps all and accepts the gifts that God
[1:46:37] sends them can you say man all right
[1:46:43] again we're here at another shaking
[1:46:47] again this is a 1963 after the seals
[1:46:52] quote God is going to send another
[1:46:55] shaking across the country for there is
[1:46:59] somebody out there still out there
[1:47:01] somewhere that a predestinated seed that
[1:47:04] the light has to follow somewhere into
[1:47:06] the world so he said God is going to
[1:47:10] send another shaking before the fire
[1:47:15] falls amen
[1:47:17] what did he promise every filling of the
[1:47:19] Holy Ghost and man he said why this
[1:47:22] church ought to be a million miles up
[1:47:25] the road to where it is now Jesus wait
[1:47:27] on his church to get ready the bride has
[1:47:30] made herself ready
[1:47:31] we got the potentials the Holy Spirit is
[1:47:34] here God is here the power to heal the
[1:47:36] sick the power to do all the things that
[1:47:38] Christ did I've seen it demonstrated
[1:47:40] myself by the Holy Spirit so the
[1:47:43] potentials are here what God is waiting
[1:47:46] for us to get away from his art
[1:47:48] tradition and come back under the blood
[1:47:50] of Jesus Christ hey man that's exactly
[1:47:55] right
[1:47:57] now I'm gonna take just a few minutes
[1:48:03] because I brought you here to this point
[1:48:06] of what we're to be and I'm just going
[1:48:10] to stop here just a moment and digress
[1:48:13] just a little bit and the reason I'm
[1:48:16] doing this
[1:48:17] when you go to preaching these kinds of
[1:48:19] things it attracts every kind of bug to
[1:48:25] the light bulb ever wannabe prophet ever
[1:48:32] wanna be the spiritual guy ever want to
[1:48:34] be healer whatever want to be every kind
[1:48:37] of thing all for the wrong motives and
[1:48:42] purposes next thing you know this then
[1:48:48] this bolsters up all of these and they
[1:48:50] begin to quack you know I'm the greatest
[1:48:53] preacher on the block I'm the Prophet
[1:48:59] now I'm the boys and this we've had them
[1:49:01] we have we've had we've had the the
[1:49:05] supreme teacher lee vale we've had the
[1:49:07] supreme apostle Joseph Coleman we've had
[1:49:10] oh my goodness you go to start naming
[1:49:12] some of these stuff today I mean it's
[1:49:14] way out there
[1:49:16] some of them calling ourselves Elohim
[1:49:19] the Holy Ghost all kinds of nonsense I
[1:49:22] don't usually talk about those things
[1:49:24] because it discourages people but I just
[1:49:27] say it you know again again that you
[1:49:30] preach these kind of thing in a truck it
[1:49:32] attracts every kind of bug insect beetle
[1:49:37] moths creatures of the night to the
[1:49:41] light and let me tell you right now I
[1:49:45] want to just make some statements here
[1:49:47] we are not returning to Azusa Street no
[1:49:54] more than we can go back to being Luther
[1:49:56] or Wesley that is not the light of the
[1:50:01] day
[1:50:03] Isuzu was by nature an impersonation
[1:50:07] because it was the shock hey math Azusa
[1:50:16] was not a book of Acts church it was at
[1:50:21] best a Corinthian church one had a
[1:50:24] prophecy one out of gift one out of town
[1:50:26] one out of this one out of that and
[1:50:28] everybody was trying to be something all
[1:50:31] the while there was sin in the church
[1:50:33] that they wouldn't deal with that's in
[1:50:38] azusa church we are not returning to
[1:50:41] Azusa a mouth nor will we be a
[1:50:49] Corinthian church hey man listen brother
[1:50:58] madam send us an adoption and that's why
[1:51:00] I preached adopts and he said I can't
[1:51:02] get the Turks to come to maturity he
[1:51:06] said why you know how it is the churches
[1:51:09] groaning you know under them under the
[1:51:12] persecution of the outside world
[1:51:14] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:51:15] the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[1:51:17] real to us as it was to Pentecost how
[1:51:21] they groan and cry under labor pains but
[1:51:25] when they're born they're persistently
[1:51:27] born in the kingdom of God it's not
[1:51:30] something you're a prophet because mama
[1:51:32] said you was since she was a little boy
[1:51:34] and they fed you that junk I've seen too
[1:51:37] many mama called preachers and they
[1:51:40] never accomplished anything hey man but
[1:51:46] when they're born and positionally sent
[1:51:49] the Holy Ghost sets in the church some
[1:51:52] prophets some teachers some pastors some
[1:51:55] evangelists and then and then he puts in
[1:51:58] there he gives in there's vegan in
[1:52:00] tongues interpretations and tongues and
[1:52:02] knowledge and wisdom and gifts of
[1:52:04] healing and all kinds of miracles all in
[1:52:08] the jerks
[1:52:10] a man but the church he says he's always
[1:52:14] tried to take somebody else's corner
[1:52:17] I mean said you can never you can never
[1:52:22] take somebody else's corner you can
[1:52:23] never raise corn in the evenings corner
[1:52:26] if you're Manasseh every one of the
[1:52:30] tribes at different places in position
[1:52:33] in the kingdom and the same way in the
[1:52:38] body there is different things that God
[1:52:41] does and how he works with different
[1:52:43] people and everybody doesn't do the same
[1:52:46] things he said now we've been taught
[1:52:54] many times we've all have to speak with
[1:52:56] tongues that's wrong we all got to do it
[1:52:59] no we don't they didn't all do one thing
[1:53:04] and then some of you have spoken times
[1:53:07] some of you haven't it's the same Holy
[1:53:09] Ghost what we're looking for is a change
[1:53:12] life not because you spoke in another
[1:53:16] language we've seen people speak in
[1:53:19] tongues and live like the devil ain't
[1:53:23] that right
[1:53:23] hey man so again it's not it's not his
[1:53:27] you see that that was that's babbling
[1:53:29] it's supporting the 14 of I'm a forged
[1:53:33] to worship Azusa Street forts gifts
[1:53:36] forts tongues and then when they
[1:53:39] couldn't get everybody speaking tongues
[1:53:41] had gotten down the hall turned taught
[1:53:42] him how jerked under chin until they did
[1:53:47] had them to repeat a word over and over
[1:53:50] again till they got a stammering lips
[1:53:52] till they set a confusion of language
[1:53:55] and there's very few real that is left
[1:54:00] but because it's their evidence of the
[1:54:02] Holy Ghost so Gavin do it or they're not
[1:54:04] saved so it causes impersonations
[1:54:08] we don't you to impersonate anything we
[1:54:12] are not to be an impersonation that's
[1:54:14] Azusa Street we want real genuine Holy
[1:54:18] Spirit moving
[1:54:20] but I tell you if you yield yourself to
[1:54:22] the Holy Ghost ain't no telling what
[1:54:23] gotta do for you hey ma'am you know we
[1:54:31] don't need another to rise up then try
[1:54:33] to take the 7th angels trace or to be
[1:54:36] the prophet in this age somebody help me
[1:54:40] preach now we've had enough of that
[1:54:43] we've had 15 years or more I can say
[1:54:46] almost 16 years to to to purge out of
[1:54:51] Zuza
[1:54:54] so that the real pen across could shine
[1:54:58] forth
[1:55:10] other Branham talks about this in the
[1:55:14] message identification and he says he
[1:55:21] said Nathan a smart leader down in Egypt
[1:55:24] rose up and said you try to make
[1:55:26] yourself the only one that's got
[1:55:27] anything like I said this kind of
[1:55:29] preaching will will attract bugs to the
[1:55:32] light we have seen men rise up in this
[1:55:36] message and become the next great
[1:55:39] prophet in their own thinking so they
[1:55:41] had followers across America and even
[1:55:43] overseas I've run into him in Africa run
[1:55:46] into him into Anna and Norway a guy who
[1:55:51] got a six-inch pick guitar pick that he
[1:55:54] was gonna give the bride rapture in
[1:55:56] faith by singing these songs and all it
[1:55:59] was was a middle guy I'm serious
[1:56:01] not throwing off on him he just had
[1:56:03] mental problems he had an evil spirit
[1:56:06] calls him mental trouble and he led
[1:56:08] people by the hundreds away and it went
[1:56:11] on down until a cricket spoke in tongues
[1:56:13] and he and interpreted and it calls
[1:56:17] fallen to way across the world just a
[1:56:27] bug at the light people with mental
[1:56:31] troubles and evil spirits try to get in
[1:56:37] their work the works of God didn't a
[1:56:39] woman fall appalled and say these men
[1:56:45] are the men of God and begin to prophesy
[1:56:47] over them and Paul wanted to mount a
[1:56:49] shut her mouth until and he couldn't do
[1:56:51] it until God gave him permission and he
[1:56:54] suffered with her for it so I don't
[1:56:56] remember how many days he suffered with
[1:56:57] her until he rebuked that spirit that
[1:57:02] spirit of divination that was attracted
[1:57:05] to the light a man so you so again you
[1:57:13] know brother madam would disarm people
[1:57:15] and call it spiritual problems you're
[1:57:16] hearing voices you're seeing things and
[1:57:18] this is spiritual problems and it takes
[1:57:22] them away from the word
[1:57:24] then bringing them into the Word of God
[1:57:26] and people follow it because they don't
[1:57:30] have any discernment now but brother man
[1:57:34] said everyone didn't have to create and
[1:57:36] do miracles and things that's the
[1:57:37] trouble with people today a lady asked
[1:57:40] me coming down the road the other day is
[1:57:42] Florence a gariand Dimas his sister
[1:57:44] sister Williams and them sat in the car
[1:57:46] she said brother Branham I passed and
[1:57:48] fasting and I still I can't cast out
[1:57:52] Devils what did brother Branham tell her
[1:57:56] you're not a believer coz the Bible said
[1:57:58] these signs have followed them that
[1:57:59] believed and you're not casting out
[1:58:01] Devils so you're not a believer that
[1:58:02] ain't what he said he said you wasn't
[1:58:04] born to do that your duty is so fast the
[1:58:11] Holy Spirit's working on somebody else
[1:58:13] out there for that you don't know your
[1:58:15] place all we said if we had time we'd
[1:58:19] teach those things and long meetings how
[1:58:21] that one person is burdened for this was
[1:58:24] something over there
[1:58:25] you don't know you don't know you don't
[1:58:26] know what a and it's him doing it
[1:58:29] you're just submissive to your call and
[1:58:30] always line it up with the scripture and
[1:58:33] see if it's not right or not but so he
[1:58:36] says you wasn't called to do that so now
[1:58:39] we see it's in the body some are you
[1:58:46] looking at me well I'm not a believer
[1:58:47] you know this morning you said that the
[1:58:49] identification of believers they'll
[1:58:51] casts out Devils well okay let's just
[1:58:55] stop right here and clear that for you
[1:58:57] every one of you saved cast out Devils
[1:59:02] out of your own life
[1:59:06] every evil thought that comes your way
[1:59:09] and you cast it down you are casting out
[1:59:11] a devil so don't let the devil come
[1:59:16] along and tell you you're some powerless
[1:59:17] Church powerless people and you don't
[1:59:21] have that identification remember cuz
[1:59:24] how else could you have overcome the
[1:59:27] habits of the world that you had come on
[1:59:29] unless the Holy Spirit in you rose up
[1:59:33] and cast him out I'm looking at a bunch
[1:59:45] of devil to Peters this morning a bunch
[1:59:48] of serpent bruisers hey man oh you said
[1:59:54] brother Tim huh I've never done what you
[1:59:55] did then the other brothers did he use
[1:59:57] Kemp maybe you're not calling to do that
[1:59:59] but you can fast and pray while somebody
[2:00:02] else is doing it you got a job to do
[2:00:07] your part of the body everybody can't be
[2:00:09] the tongue everybody can be the iPhone
[2:00:10] everybody kept me there everybody can't
[2:00:15] be there hand everybody can't be the
[2:00:16] foot it's somebody question answers they
[2:00:22] they ask brother Brandon whatever true
[2:00:24] believer this 19c serve or do the works
[2:00:27] of Jesus dead in John 14:12 he said not
[2:00:29] exactly no heal the sick cast out Devils
[2:00:32] razor then I don't I don't think that's
[2:00:35] John 14 he said mark 16 it's okay he
[2:00:38] says this only to be Elijah must all the
[2:00:40] believers do this that really believe if
[2:00:42] he's really a Berea believer will he
[2:00:43] raise the dead and do great miracles and
[2:00:45] brother Brennan said now that's among
[2:00:49] believers hello you know when you when
[2:00:56] brother Brandon went up to the mountain
[2:00:57] and got a sword you know you got a sword
[2:01:00] do you know when the seals was open to
[2:01:03] him that seals were open to you come on
[2:01:07] a man when Moses went up there and got
[2:01:10] the Ten Commandments not just Moses got
[2:01:12] it that was easier getting the Ten
[2:01:14] Commandments
[2:01:15] oh man when I preach the gospel anywhere
[2:01:18] around the world it's you preaching the
[2:01:20] gospel around the world
[2:01:21] oh man well when I'm door when I pray
[2:01:25] for the sick and they recover or any
[2:01:27] other believer does it it's you doing it
[2:01:30] that is a mom believe us but see if Zeus
[2:01:37] the street you got an over one of them
[2:01:40] to be doing this and we got to have this
[2:01:41] and this is kind of spiritual dream and
[2:01:43] that one's got a vision and this one's
[2:01:44] got a voice and this has got this and
[2:01:47] and it becomes a bunch of confusion
[2:01:50] because they turn it to in a Corinthian
[2:01:53] church anyway he says now and then he
[2:02:05] says every man doesn't have those gifts
[2:02:08] don't mean just one person would do it
[2:02:10] it'll be groups of people like for
[2:02:11] instance we have a little girl here in
[2:02:13] the church the little boy is somebody
[2:02:15] that we love real well in life but go
[2:02:17] out of them the whole church would get
[2:02:19] together and go to fasting and praying
[2:02:20] lord have mercy on that child God can
[2:02:22] raise it up I mean read they're not
[2:02:24] seeing fathers in them you know that's
[2:02:25] the way they did it in the early church
[2:02:27] they'd all get together you know even
[2:02:28] raise up their pastor sometimes in
[2:02:30] different ones if God seemed fit to do
[2:02:32] it the church praying amen so now again
[2:02:39] what is promised in this outpour is
[2:02:42] another Pentecost and I want to say it's
[2:02:47] not coming that's here that's what a
[2:02:53] prophet restored us to was back to the
[2:02:57] faith of the fathers another Pentecost
[2:03:02] not another Azusa Street but another
[2:03:06] book of Acts not another book of
[2:03:09] Corinthians brother Branham cries out in
[2:03:15] 1963 bring us back to Pentecost not
[2:03:19] Hollywood's children ship but a whole
[2:03:21] hearted turn to God is what we need one
[2:03:24] more Oh Lord what's more a man
[2:03:29] uniting timeand sinuses What did he say
[2:03:32] in malachi for would restore restore
[2:03:35] back the original Pentecostal faith back
[2:03:38] to the people with the same Pentecostal
[2:03:41] message the same Pentecost assigned the
[2:03:45] same Pentecostal evidence the same God
[2:03:47] same power same treatment same exactly
[2:03:50] with the vindication of the same pillar
[2:03:52] of fire that struck Paul down on the
[2:03:54] road to Damascus amongst us today
[2:03:56] doing the same things he did in that day
[2:03:58] in birth pains
[2:03:59] he says die and he talks about the
[2:04:02] mission of the bride and he says what he
[2:04:05] said I saw that same group come back
[2:04:07] again she's half an Omega
[2:04:09] what is cease to be the same ride the
[2:04:12] same kind built on the same kind of
[2:04:15] material she was in the first place
[2:04:17] they'll read out Malachi 4 in silver not
[2:04:20] suppose have a message in the last day
[2:04:22] that will turn the hearts of the
[2:04:24] children back to the father's back to
[2:04:27] the original Pentecostal message word by
[2:04:31] word brothers we are here this message
[2:04:39] is the original Pentecostal messy it's
[2:04:43] not as easy street it's not John Wesley
[2:04:46] or Martin Luther it's the seventh angels
[2:04:49] message a man some people who gives
[2:04:54] throw him preeminence to the word in the
[2:04:57] revenue resume of the aegis notice
[2:05:00] somebody who had gives him preeminence
[2:05:03] people that are a prisoner to Christ
[2:05:07] resume of the ages he said God's gonna
[2:05:09] restore the Lutheran age did not restore
[2:05:12] the church it started or information the
[2:05:15] Western age didn't restored the
[2:05:16] Pentecost rage did not restore but God
[2:05:19] has to restore because he cannot deny
[2:05:22] his word this is not the resurrection of
[2:05:25] the churches so restoration God will
[2:05:27] take the church right back to Pentecost
[2:05:30] out the beginning so this is different
[2:05:34] from Azusa Street the Sousa Street
[2:05:38] revival now has 500
[2:05:42] million followers wrap your mind around
[2:05:51] that one that little movement back over
[2:05:55] a hundred and twenty something years ago
[2:05:57] now has a half a billion followers and
[2:06:06] let me just say now it's not going to be
[2:06:10] another Azusa Street that makes a bunch
[2:06:14] of denominations this will be different
[2:06:18] even from the divine healing revival
[2:06:23] this out porn will not be another divine
[2:06:26] healing revival understand what I'm
[2:06:30] saying
[2:06:31] it won't be divine healing movements all
[2:06:34] over and hearing people come and draw
[2:06:36] all over the world I am NOT saying
[2:06:38] people will come to church here and be
[2:06:39] prayed for that's not what I'm saying
[2:06:41] I'm just saying it won't be another
[2:06:42] divine healing move that's not what the
[2:06:46] last outpouring is it's not another
[2:06:49] divine healing move let me just tell you
[2:06:54] what brother Branham said about the
[2:06:56] divine healing move I guess he ought to
[2:06:57] know he was the one who's the catalyst
[2:07:00] of it all and he says he takes us to
[2:07:04] James 514 what you just put that up
[2:07:10] because this is the responsibility of
[2:07:13] every church every message Church should
[2:07:18] make this one this scripture it's
[2:07:20] principle Scripture is is any sick among
[2:07:24] you let him call for the elders of the
[2:07:27] church and let them pray over him
[2:07:29] anointing him with oil in the name of
[2:07:31] the Lord next verse and the prayer of
[2:07:34] faith shall save the sick and the Lord
[2:07:36] shall raise him up and he was committed
[2:07:38] sins he they shall be forgiven him Mar
[2:07:43] that that scripture right there in James
[2:07:45] 5:14 come on
[2:07:51] so while God was to get us away from
[2:07:53] laying on the hands well maybe he does
[2:07:55] but he puts this in the church hey man I
[2:08:00] believe it can be as Peter spoke these
[2:08:02] words and even knew you that are
[2:08:04] listening across the world today I can't
[2:08:07] go to you and lay hands on you but the
[2:08:08] word can go to you and you can believe
[2:08:10] and receive it just as well as anybody
[2:08:12] here in the building
[2:08:15] hey ma'am but anyway again I give that's
[2:08:19] the duty he says of every Christian
[2:08:21] minister ever minister the gospel is a
[2:08:25] right to pray for his congregation and
[2:08:27] they have a right to believe God and be
[2:08:29] healed divine healing doesn't belong to
[2:08:32] one man or one group it belongs all the
[2:08:35] people the gift the healing was not
[2:08:37] given to be given to be sent out to have
[2:08:40] different healing campaigns across the
[2:08:42] country it's alright for them to do for
[2:08:45] them to me but that wasn't that isn't
[2:08:47] the purpose there ought to be a healing
[2:08:49] campaign in every Church all the time
[2:08:52] going on everywhere and man we shouldn't
[2:08:59] have to wait for special ministry to
[2:09:01] come by I mean even you know shouldn't
[2:09:05] even have to I didn't even Sydney map to
[2:09:07] wait you know for me to lay hands on
[2:09:08] them you we've seen it demonstrate just
[2:09:11] lay hands on your baby and it's hearing
[2:09:13] come back sit it right in the meeting so
[2:09:17] I don't need these hearing aids anymore
[2:09:20] right there wherever you're at do you
[2:09:23] know your back healed your your your
[2:09:25] come on now church ever need supplied
[2:09:28] right is the world is going for appeal
[2:09:31] get the devil but through your every
[2:09:34] time I preach I'm rebuking Devils
[2:09:37] hallelujah I'm telling them you lead the
[2:09:39] church you leave this body you believe
[2:09:42] these believers greater witness brother
[2:09:48] Brennan said God never intended all
[2:09:50] these campaigns sweeping across the
[2:09:52] nation he expected that to be in every
[2:09:55] church every pastor so let me tell you
[2:10:00] it's not going to be another divine
[2:10:02] healing campaign
[2:10:09] God has let us have 50 plus years to
[2:10:15] pass to get Azusa Street out of us with
[2:10:20] all his carnal impersonations its
[2:10:23] wannabe prophets oh yeah they stand on
[2:10:26] the fringes of this message because they
[2:10:28] know it's got a supernatural element
[2:10:30] hoping to be one of the witnesses to the
[2:10:33] Jews and thinking they're gonna get the
[2:10:35] revelation of the seven thunders well
[2:10:38] you you know it is showed you're not a
[2:10:41] student of this message you ain't got
[2:10:43] into the word if you knew the word you
[2:10:45] know the thunders have already been
[2:10:46] revealed they just have been revealed to
[2:10:49] you so you're still standing around
[2:10:51] looking priests revelation well it come
[2:10:53] to a prophet is the seventh angels
[2:10:56] message if he didn't reveal the seven
[2:10:58] thunders he wasn't the seventh angel and
[2:11:01] if he is the seventh angel then he
[2:11:03] revealed the seven thunders and he
[2:11:05] didn't need he didn't mean some apostles
[2:11:07] helped to do it and he didn't need some
[2:11:11] teachers help to explain it and he don't
[2:11:14] even need my help it's right there in
[2:11:18] the message itself the seven thunders
[2:11:20] are though when the seven seals are the
[2:11:22] mysteries of the seven thunders they
[2:11:25] were revealed in the seals there were
[2:11:29] what symbols but now the voice of God
[2:11:31] has spoke out and now we know who the
[2:11:33] white horse are read the back impale the
[2:11:42] Tundra's have been revealed so if you
[2:11:44] don't know what they are you hadn't been
[2:11:47] in the message that's all there is to it
[2:11:48] or either that you've been looking at it
[2:11:51] with denominational veil on it the seals
[2:11:54] and the thunders are different brother
[2:11:55] Tim yeah they're different in that God's
[2:11:58] sealed a mystery and the others when God
[2:12:00] reveals a mystery God sealed it up not
[2:12:04] revealed it the thunders are the seals
[2:12:06] was the Salem the thunders was the
[2:12:08] revealing it is that simple
[2:12:10] you can make it hard and difficult if
[2:12:13] you want to and they're all open
[2:12:21] over a hundred times brother madam said
[2:12:24] all the seals are open well yeah there
[2:12:27] was times he said the Seventh Seal you
[2:12:29] know God wouldn't permit that because he
[2:12:31] wouldn't release it he'd said too much
[2:12:34] about the third Pole but now we got it
[2:12:39] God's sealed it up in seven seals and
[2:12:42] now the voice of God the thunders have
[2:12:43] uttered the voices and gave us
[2:12:45] interpretation of what was sealed up and
[2:12:49] I don't want to say we don't need
[2:12:51] another prophet we don't need another
[2:12:54] revelation and we don't need to go
[2:12:57] beyond the Prophet and his message
[2:13:00] hey ma'am but I would like to see
[2:13:02] somebody come up to it and really
[2:13:06] believe all of it this is the third pole
[2:13:11] and it will not be impersonated we're
[2:13:13] not too shocked we're not impersonators
[2:13:16] it will not be a puppet show it will not
[2:13:22] be another worldwide healing campaign or
[2:13:24] another worldwide revival the
[2:13:28] manifestation of the word of the third
[2:13:30] pole though will be miracles Amanda will
[2:13:35] be a bride standing on her feet as a
[2:13:37] mighty invincible army amen
[2:13:42] that's where we stand on this day a man
[2:13:47] we stand right here at the end time and
[2:13:50] we see where God is not fulfilling his
[2:13:53] word and bringing it to pass look what
[2:13:56] the third pole was it's created do you
[2:14:02] know every divine healing is a creation
[2:14:06] when God healed my wife the other day he
[2:14:09] had me he had to create new he had to
[2:14:12] create new brain cells when he took
[2:14:18] cancer out of sister Atlanta he had to
[2:14:21] create new cells
[2:14:24] she didn't have an empty place it was
[2:14:26] creation a man the third pole where'd is
[2:14:31] the creation it went for a thousand
[2:14:34] miles and healed me to Branham and it
[2:14:37] vanished the miracle the third pole you
[2:14:42] say I when we're preaching to their pool
[2:14:43] then there are to be miracles you can't
[2:14:47] preach the word and there not be
[2:14:49] miracles come on church amen
[2:14:56] my goodness that's what we ought to be
[2:14:57] looking for is a God of miracles God

[2:15:09] boys of hatty rights they fell on their
[2:15:12] knees weeping and crying he wasn't a
[2:15:14] dried confession it was the Word of God
[2:15:18] that went forth and saved the last
