morning you would speak to our hearts help us Lord to step out of the way Lord but you minister to your people or do you know the things are upon our hearts just help us we pray in Jesus name [Music] let's turn to Genesis 1 in verse 1 and also Leviticus 25 Amen it's always good to be in the house of the Lord amen just a wonderful place to stop for a moment in a man and just let all the world go by Amen huh I just let the world go by this morning hey man just let Fox News and whatever else you've been looking at just going by hey man we're here with Jesus for a moment and this time set aside to worship Him and to hear from him Genesis 1 and verse 1 it says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light also Leviticus 25 and verse 9 then shall that cause the trumpet of Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the Day of Atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possessions and you shall turn every man unto his family a man will let you be seated this morning just like to speak to you on the never-failing word and then also freedom released amen him and how many's glad that your freedom has been given to you amen just been looking at these things for some time as we had been away from the pulpit for a moment with the team taking a few Wednesday nights and then our meetings and others like to say that some of the best meetings or not the best meetings I've ever been in in my life just seeing God moved for his people and how many of this morning can say God moved for me amen God reached down and touched me you know it's amazing how that you know some meetings I've talked to different than ministers and when you just all agree some meetings you know you have maybe out of five or six services you have a couple of them that were just outstanding but in this meeting I don't know I just think every one of them was outstanding God moving time after time after time and then just to see how everything was orchestrated of the Lord and how God put things in place I mean you know brother Ron preaching that Saturday night and taking it out of there and Zig light was burned and abigail was taken you know I was speaking to brother Josh just this week and he said you know that very week as they was preparing to comb actually the very evening they was leaving and trying to get things done and he's he's in the middle of building a house and got a lot of things going on and on his plate but he's trying to get out and and get out and get out on a good time and as they stopped to meet another family to bring some more young people with them they was eating in a restaurant and sister Abigail his youngest daughter there was started to having a panic attack and just a real fear coming over and she didn't want to come and so you know he said I as a father was just really feeling sorry for her and and thought well you know I'll talked I told her I talked to your mom and we'll find a place for you to stay and maybe with somebody and so he went to talk to him and sister Kimberly and she said no no no she's going with us said this is her time for deliverance and God orchestrating all of that and bringing all that together and and knowing that young lady and how that thing had been on her for her to be able to grab ahold of a man's arm and come out of the out of the mezzanine there and walk down it had to be God and God moving upon his people and and you know just hearing the voice of God speak service after service and it was such power and then not only just power but also vindication and God fulfilling his word and and bringing what he said to pass you know him and as our pastors been on healing and things and bringing that back to our remembers I thought you know Wednesday night was just a wonderful follow-up to that that healing is ours it's ours our possession it's not sicknesses not the glory of God Healing is the glory of God and I believe that's you know a lot of the devil's try to put on us you know through the theologians and things of this day you know an hour days past that that you know we had to bear those things we have to live with those things but he meant we're not amen of children of bondage we're children of freedom and God has brought in perfect Liberty a man in this hour that we're living by a message that was spoken you know as we look here I just thinking on these things as God would begin to speak the very first words that are written here in the Bible that he spoke let there be light and there was light it was a voice that was spoke into the darkness it was a voice that was spoke into nothingness but once that voice was released and most said nothing could stop it and nothing could keep it from coming to pass any man it had to fulfill what was in his mind and and I believe going God speaks in this day it has the same the same power the same vindication the same thing that thing that once it's released nothing can stop it but it will fulfill that which is which is in his mind you know and thinking about the Jubilee that was sounding in in the in the beginning of a creation that God was going to bring a perfect creation and he was going to bring it according to what was in his mind and and you know and then bringing it down into Leviticus as he would begin to tell the children of Israel that on the fiftieth year the trumpet shall sound and when it shall sound a bit Jubilee and every man can return to his possession now it did not hinge on him with whether the taskmaster was there the slave owner was there not or what or if if symptoms was there it didn't matter got none of that when that trumpet sounded Amen it had a voice that was released and that voice went forth into the land and nothing could stop a man nothing could put it back once it was sounded him in it once it was accepted it was over and it went beyond what the slave owner had to say anymore it wouldn't be on what he felt if he went beyond the symptoms that was there a man it didn't matter if the slave owner was still standing there or or shall we say symptoms were still there it had sounded and it was over with and nothing could put it back you know I I've had this laying in my office and I've referred to it many times and and I've got this over in Israel you know this is the ram's horn and this is something similar to what they would have over there in Israel no doubt maybe they'd have some bigger ram horns or whatever that they would play but once that that ram's horn had sounded there was nothing that could take the sound that had lift left there Amen this sound meant something it wasn't just a bunch of air being blowed through a trumpet but it had a meaning Amen and it had something I had a landing place and when it found that landing place there was nothing that could stop it from bring it to pass Amen I'll Bob just blow it if I've been wanting to blow it in church so I'll just do it right now that's our o you now try to take that sound and put it back in here you can't do it it's already been released it's already been spoken and there ain't nothing that can take it and put it back amen and I believe that we have heard messages after messages it was a jubilee trumpet sound and it was Amen the conflict between God and Satan it was armed and dangerous it was all of these sayings down they meant that down through every service God sounding the trumpet and they in a devil in hell that can make you take it back they need a devil in hell they can take the power away from them I don't care how many critics rise up and say it's this or that or whatever don't matter to me they cannot take it been put it back to what's been released to this church amen to the people that are here amen when this rock that was released this is a rock that was fat that I picked up in the very valley that David gathered stones that he meant when that rock was released from that sling and it was let go it wasn't a devil that could stop it goliath couldn't stop it there was nothing that can keep it from hitting his mark because it was released in the name of Jesus Christ and I believe that we have heard service after service after service and I want you to understand the devil can't do nothing about amen he's already released it it's a word that will not fail it will bring it to pass and they don't matter this morning if you still have symptoms we're going to deal with symptoms this morning but if you still have symptoms that means nothing if you still have stuff that's trying to hold on that don't mean nothing the sound has been given and released already amen sometimes a man he says in a vision of a to break forth and he said I'll say thus saith the Lord he said you better watch it then it's already happened thus saith the Lord you're healed in the name of Jesus Christ you're going to be well he said when that happens there ain't enough Devils in hell hallelujah what I want you to know we have thus saith the Lord for healing by His stripes I am healed I'm the Lord God that heals all other diseases we have thus sayeth the Lord so if we have thus saith the Lord ain't enough Devils that can keep her from coming to pass he said the woman will go home she'll feel good for a few days the life has gone out but he said the cancer that was there she'll feel good and going rejoicing the first thing you know corruption will set in he said what is it he said it's that little germ that was in there's cause that cancer he said the devil has went out but that thing is still there but she's healed but she just got to keep going home no matter and no matter how sick she gets she needs to still believe because nothing can change it amen she's bound to get sicker the whole thing begins to swell the first thing you know it gets worse she gets sick she gets a fever she gets down what's happening that thing is dying it is rotting amen congratulations if your symptoms have gotten worse that means that thing is dying hallelujah now either he goes on to say nay he said there are miracles that the thing just disappears he said but healing he said when that spirit is cast out that's that that body of that spirit is still there and it has to rot away and the symptoms may seem to get worse but just hold on a little bit the words already been released say man and they ain't enough Devils that can keep it from coming to pass hey man he says see Jesus said verily verily I say unto you not only this tree but if you say to that mountain be removed and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass these are all glory he said I like these meetings where we could just get together yes sir and say these words in my name they shall cast out devils we witnessed that in my name they shall cast out devils that's what he said that's what I believe that's thus saith the Lord in my name they shall cast out devils they shall lay hands upon their sick and they shall recover there's a devil exposed right there your cancer with that little pet name called cancer he's nothing but a devil and he said that little favor that's been bothering you it's a devil that's what the devil tries to do to all the time burn you up on something make you sicker when you're prayed for make you think you lost your experience with God he's lying to you [Applause] his time comes and when we have to stand on God's Word and we make Stan but when that time comes stand there because it's a never-failing word hallelujah there's got to be a time you got to separate yourself from your feelings in your faith the time is now let me go on he says sometimes when the evil spirit goes out of a person many times they don't realize it right then don't know what to do he said they don't some of them say oh I got sicker he says you're supposed to get sicker hello somebody says you're supposed to get sicker they don't know that he said but that growth that you're dealing with the doctor deals with he cuts it out but we're dealing with the life of that growth it's a devil he said that cancer the cancers are one of our great killers cancers has a life and if other life besides another life besides your life is growing spreading the Bible calls of the devil the cancer is called by a medical name but we know what it is it's a devil a tormentor he said a cancer when there's life was going out of the cancer it's Dan but the growth is still there unless a miracle is performed hey man will the growth hang in there no life in it it's death he said what would a piece of meat he said about that big in your bodies and in plain old southern way of speaking every southern 0kay play no southern way of speaking it about that big begin to rot in your body and that heart begins to beat and your blood things of blood through your bloodstream and it picks up that old dead substance of this cancers body it'll set in a fever you'll be sicker than ever you'll feel good the first 72 hours or so but then the body begins to corrupt he said but just hold on hey man hallelujah hope you're still holding on maybe some of you this morning your symptoms have gotten worse and you're thinking mom what's going on I thought I was healed you were healed and you'll stay healed as long as you'll believe that that's just that old devil Dino body that he was in it's corrupting his dawn it's wilted away why because it's a never-failing word God said so he said if a patient has something like a tumor or something of that order their patient will feel better right away but within about 72 hours they'll get sicker than ever was because the lump or whatever it was a lump that was in that than life that was in that lump is dead but the lump is still there and it begins to break up and the heart pumps the blood the blood / purifies the body it sets in the fever and sometimes they think oh I lost my healing he said why the faith that could take the life out of that tumor unbelief will bring it back again and there they'll lose their healing but he said hold on God will take care of it come on somebody hold on God will take care of it he said little boy here in the wheelchair you're blind sir you're laying on the cotton hold on to God's unchanging hand the devil might have bit you and maybe there's but there's enough drawing power in the Rock of Ages let me hide myself in there the devil can't get you when you're hitting their stick with it hold on to it don't let it away from you no matter how many symptoms appear how many this or that or the other hold on stay there until the healing power has drawn all of that disease away from you he will do it because he said he would but we're not to look at symptoms if you look to symptoms you're sure to be lost any man any time we look to the natural things always lost their victory we're not here where it where we're not even at work we're not to people but we're also a supernatural people hey man he's going to talk about symptoms he said of Jonah and the belly of the whale would have looked at symptoms he the first thing he was back slid and now he's bound hands and feet he was thrown out of the ship on a stormy sea and then a fish swallows him he goes down to the bottom begins to sit there maybe four or five miles deep Jonah back slid running from God hands tied behind him on a stormy sea five miles deep in the sea in a whale's belly if you look this way whales belly that way swells better than right up there as well belly maybe all you've seen this this week is arthritis or you've seen your hands or you seen your feet or you've seen this all you can see is that don't worry about that that's just symptoms there's already been a sound released hallelujah that's the symptoms they meant he reported Jonah said he said they're lying Vanity's and he turned away from what he could see with his natural eyes and he turned his eyes he said once more well I look towards your holy temple what had happened solemnly when he dedicated the temple it was a release of a sound he said when your people are in trouble if we look to this temple and pray they'll hear from heaven and he said if a man who was back slidden and running from God would have the ability to look away from the symptom how much more should have people feel with the Holy Ghost when I look away from the sickness and their trouble and turned their eyes not to a temple made with hands but to a cross hey man he said you'll hear from heaven hallelujah if not people be in trouble anywhere like that and look towards the Holy Temple and pray then hear from heaven and he believed that God heard Solomon's prayer how many believe God heard your prayers weekend or the minister they prayed for you he said if he could look towards the natural earthly temple through a prayer of an earthly man that had been prayed and believed that God heard it how much more ought you and I as Christians that may be bound with diseases look towards heaven where Christ sits on the right hand of God with his own blood making now for anything symptoms yeah you'll have them but they're lying vanities don't receive don't have nothing to do with it if you look at them you're looking away from God hey man we look at the unseen not what we can see no one can look at what they see and be a Christian you got to believe things that are unseen it's by faith you're healed not by sight or by feeling you're not here because you can see that you're healed you're healed but called by faith you believe a word that was released mercy I got to say something about this we got a young man sitting right here your name brother David but David you know whether David flew in yesterday flew into the airport he'd been streaming all of our services he said I got to be in that church he flew in the airport thought it's gonna rent a car he took young to rent a car or something couldn't get a car spent the night in the airport somebody gave him a ride to church this morning hey man that's my faith hallelujah amen if a man can believe that somehow I'm going to be in those services and I'm going to go out got to be there and put such energy and pay a ticket not knowing how what how is going to happen but be there listen God's got a word this morning and he's letting you know hey my world has been spoken and it will come to pass if you believe all things are possible we're looking at your symptoms we're looking at your problems look to the hills which cometh out that help cometh from the Lord amen of God could send a raven the feet of prophet in the middle of a dry time he can send the promised a year that I'll heal every disease he'll send the word to your young people that's out there where you were he'll do whatever it takes God can move in impossible situations amen all it takes is a word to be relieved I want you to understand this morning you have a trumpet in your own hands in your own body it's called your mouth and when you speak the Word of God anyone a believer this filled with the Holy Ghost speaks the Word of God it's the same as deity speaking let there be light I want to say as a parent here this morning that I look at her beyond all the blackness and all the sin and say let there be life all of a sudden something will begin the world and all of a sudden out of born out of darkness what step that son of daughter of God hallelujah hey man he said what if someone come up to you today some Express agent thought a basket full of rattlesnakes it had your name on it's in here they're yours and you know what they are he says just like your symptoms he said if you received them they're yours but if you don't take them you say I don't want them how about somebody is there somebody this morning to release a word and said I don't want them the devil he had an Express agent or the devil can stand there and argue all he wants to but until you sign for them they belong to him don't sign for nothing the devil brings you say that it is I refuse it take it back hallelujah we heard certainly night take it back we're gonna reverse it on the devil you take it back it's not mine that sickness a mind that alter I the same mind then in trouble ain't mine that I blood pressure in my true diabetes same I do take you go back to Hell where you came from I want the devil to leave this morning Mac and all these systems back to hell I'm not siding for I'm not receiving nothing from these devil I'm going home hill in the name of Jesus prize take it back to you the step my son after bear take your hands off to the Lord listen when you can do that that's when you're getting framed give your face a chance turn it loose try to loose on the devil unbridled let it go to work you've got to bow down with traditions when I've just got to carry this I just got a hisses for God's going on no no he's been a word released can I do it again I heard it was denied you don't have to live with that thing you don't have to stay bound down for 18 years rise up in the name of Jesus [Applause] [Music] [Applause] tiny lows listen you wouldn't put on this earth for the devil to torment you you was put on this earth to torment a gamma hallelujah somebody's world is right either you're looking at what your symptoms are what the devil says are you looking at what God says but the first time there's a prophet of God you testify of your sickness it brings you right down to that realm again you sign for it refuse it testify of what you believe come on somebody go ahead testify of what you believe he said when I had stomach trouble so bad to even the doctors thought I was going to die for ate another meal I refused to testify anymore but nothing what God said what God said I was going to believe Jesus died to heal us everyone I mean Wednesday night goodness if I don't just shut the devil's mouth up that's what happens when this error leaves this it goes and it shuts the devil's mouth he can't say nothing against the Word of God he knows his times over a man when that horn was released a slave owner didn't have no right to say nothing no more couldn't say hey you gotta hold this you hold this and then you can go it's free it's for God's glory are you kidding me I heard a sound I just wanna throw this thing down and I'm walking away from here hey man Jesus if they if if sickness is for God's glory for you to live in sickness then Jesus died in vain he died that you could be free so simple that's that's his glory is your freedom everything else is the Catholicism bringing people back to bondage bringing people back to well you got to do this and pay so much penance and then you'll make Maloney take that tin can garbage somewhere else I'm eating on the Lamb's Book of Life every one of you is healed he said every one Jesus died to heal us every one of you is healed every one of you is healed right now how many wants to testify that right now Eamon right now Jesus has already healed you you just have to confess it and believe it by His stripes you were past tense he'll that's when he did it at Calvary that's when he overcome all sickness sin at Calvary for you just like a table sit in there only thing you have to do is go eat you have to accept to believe it on your heart confess that he's the high priest of our confession he said but when I started to eat and swallow the first mouthful doctor said one mouthful will be indigestion the board died right there and he said I went in and I fixed me the biggest bowl of beans and cornbread and onions that's tough on a good stomach ain't that right brilliant that's tough on him on a good stomach said you take it I he said but I took it and I asked the blessings over and I put it in my mouth and I chewed it up and I swallowed it and the Whisperer came and said you're gonna die and here it come right back up he said I held my and I swallowed it back down again so nope I'm

will defeat Satan any place any time anywhere on any condition I'm thankful the Word of God isn't dependent on a certain day or a certain time or certain place you defeat Satan anywhere any time any place on any condition that's what it is God's Word heavens and earth to pass away but his work shall never fail he said my word will not return unto me void he sends his word out his word is going to

fellow was blind in a meeting there in Fort Wayne coming to the meeting several thousand people about two nights before the piano played the great position now is near the sympathizing Jesus by the way when our piano went off that wasn't the Lord that was somebody hit the button but this was the Lord he's the sisters playing and she grazes her hands the piano continues to play the Great Physician now is near the sympathizing Jesus in the angel God in a world of world down in the room lies that and I thought a custodian to turn the light on me when I had a little boy in my arms and dropped him other girl Nazarene girl playing the tenth piano she jumped up started running and screaming she's seeing that little boy walk off the platform normal she had a reason to jump up and scream and just in case and I know they will critics are gonna see our jumping and screaming and they're gonna criticize don't criticize because you wasn't here there was a reason to jump and scream [Applause] I won't tell you right now they said well you're just going back to Pentecost well praise the Lord but the problem is they get Azusa Street and Pentecost mixed up we're going back to Pentecost back to the original and as far as I can understand and read all about it there was a bunch of jumping and screaming going on drunk people staggering out and people accusing them gonna be in there drinking some wine and they said what you mean this ain't the third out of the day we think the wine you're thinking about but this is that that the Prophet Joel spoke about and I'd like to tell whoever wants to watch it this is that that Peter spoke about this is that the Joel spoke about and listen I'll take that kind of atmosphere I'll take it everyday I'll take it every service because I seen what that atmosphere produces I've taken atmosphere jumping in screaming if it produces a little girl that was bound by fear so horribly she didn't even want to leave her house unto where she can be set free I don't take an atmosphere and take a hold of my wife and take all the redness away from her and a high blood pressure away from her I'll take that kind of atmosphere go ahead finish on but I'll let you know he wasn't here I have a reason to shout I have a reason to dead I have a reason to praise my god he backed it up he said hey hey neighbor hey Dennis I didn't know he did it how many was healed in that atmosphere how many was delivered that atmosphere I don't feel with the Holy Ghost and that's what I it's the same atmosphere that gave a black man back his side that didn't happen right there but it was said right there hello come on somebody it didn't happen that night or the next night he didn't happen right then but it was said right there you're healed John Ryan you're going to receive your side he said I'm healed I'm still blind but the Lord had been released the word had been spoken and it didn't matter how long C word and the Word of God is not captured by time he's not in the boundaries of time this word goes beyond time because this word is not a creature of time it's a creature of eternity hollowing and the sweater said you're healed John Ron John Ramos who we mean I'm here I'm still blind he said I didn't say it he said it and if he said he's going to bring the path well what should i do brother Brendan just go testifying you're healed now John Ron still had symptoms he still could walk couldn't feel his way around he was still dependent on feelings but the wired it said he's healed the word said it's over brother branham said if gusts so sunken that your man's heart he said okay and said the next couple of nights and said I couldn't hardly preach he was up in the mezzanine he'd stand up and say hey wait just a minute God healed me [Applause] God healed me hit me back to my seat next night mother Ana's preacher wait hey hey oh god help me [Applause] hallelujah and it didn't even happen in that weekend of meetings but God's Word was released but Brandon said God said it and I want you to understand this weekend but the judge for the rod by the way they didn't say it God said it and of God said he'll bring it to pass it may not happen to me it may not happen in church it may happen while you're sitting on the borrow barber's chair it may happen while the critics are making fun of you because you caused such a stir in the city and you've been testifying of the grace of Almighty God it might happen in that moment but just keep on praising here's John Ron sending his barber chair did he say hey barber guess what happened to me he said what happened you John he said God healed me he said what do you mean God healed you what do you have he said I once was blind but now I see and the barber said what do you mean you once was fine I can still wait a minute John's gone I want to ask you something who really wants the blind man who really wants a blind man it was that barber who refused to hear God's Word [Applause] amen God is in the business of delivering his people but see he says again what happens tomorrow some of you ladies what if an expressed agent would come to your house say how you doing man so have something for you and you look at it and it's a great big box full of rattlesnakes what are you gonna do sister Kathy I feel like there's a broom somewhere oh my I can tell you what you know we would come home from our meetings and one of my dogs is in his pen bears his name he lived up to his name we go three foot water moccasin got in his pen no bear he still had the symptoms of it he's swollen out but you know what Oh moccasin was dead the symptoms didn't change that the moccasin was dead your symptoms don't change that your enemies dead it changes nothing they don't change the Word of God your enemy is still Dan you may still bear the symptoms but just hold on a minute and you won't see a sign of it anymore it'll all be gone this is what Miriam did when she played the tambourine she still saw symptoms I'm amazed at the Bible when only one side of the Red Sea God said your enemy you'll see no more forever on the other side and said they saw them floating in the Red Sea but God knew that the enemy that they would see wasn't the same enemy he's a dead enemy therefore he has no power to pick up a whip no more he has no unction to say a word no more he has nothing left the dirty can't do nothing Florida God amen just because that you got the symptoms and Miriam saw the symptoms but she began to praise God but it wasn't too many moments later he was at the bottom of the Red Sea and there wasn't a sign of him left hallelu Amen what happens he says the devil to say they're yours your name's Holman he said that's one way it's short but still it isn't yours until the sign for and if you don't sign it you'll have to take it back you might see all your symptoms and the devil says here it is here's your cancer here's your heart trouble here's your crippled condition refuse to sign for anything the devil brings because whatever he brings and good refuse it I won't have none of it if you can believe and confess the name of the Lord Jesus I accept Jesus Christ as my healer how many can just say that right now I accept Jesus Christ as my healer there's no affliction no disease that can stay on you hallelujah stay right within the first thing time you know you'll get weak and say well honey and you just say well yep I still got it and said though but what happens the devil come back and say y'all come on sign for it I refuse it how you feeling wonderful hallelujah show the devil what you're made of you're born again by the Spirit of God you don't have to bow down to his images stay right there say I don't want your stuff he said maybe that's your casing that wheelchair there and there remember what a good man did for you one day he says a devil might have tied you up to that thing he said but there's a good man Jesus Christ who redeemed you who cut every string loose from you when you see the rest of them rise into your feet and believe it do the same thing because you're free from the devil's pits hallelujah don't sign for nothing he brought it don't mean you have to have it refuse it I still ain't got it devil take it all back that's all I won't have it refuse to have your sickness your arthritis whatever it is I just haven't got it by His stripes I'm healed stand right on that ground and confess it believers stay there God will bring it to pass no matter what it is just believing but he said if people keep looking at their symptoms a pastor will pray for them they'll go over so I don't seem to be any better that's not healing symptoms sometimes gets worse he said one of the greatest scarecrows the devil's got immense symptoms just has nothing to do with it because God said so that's the Scarecrow the symptom he said there's anything ever had a case of symptoms it was Jonah he had a bad symptom back slid hands tied behind the belly of the whale deep in the ocean stormy sea sea waves wrapped around his neck talk about simple but he looked at from them everywhere he look was Wells belly but he said they're lying vanities and I'm not gonna look at them no more depends on what you're looking at if you're looking at your symptoms they'll be there if you look at God's words symptoms will vanish hallelujah mercy he's at all going back to the snakes he says they're there the Devils there we're not trying to imagine that he's not there it's not know who plot like that he's there he's a real devil they're there your name might be pinned on he might've wrote your name there he might have marked you for death or anything but refused to say it say by his stripes I'm healed testify which means say the same thing if I testify in court saying and there's something another I got to say the same thing that I sing testify means to say the same thing God said that's what he was doing he it wasn't you know we get the idea that what we're lying well you know I don't feel good it's not it's not but we're not returning our looks away from our feelings and you're testifying not of your you're not saying what the sickness is saying you're saying what God said to be a true testimony amen by His stripes I'm healed he said listen little children the Word of God will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time in any conditions when Jesus was here he was God God in Christ reconciling them self it worked himself but he never used any of his gifts he brought the kingdom of God so low that the weakest Christian could use it when Satan comes he said if thou be but jesus said is written if thou be jesus said it was written he used the word of God to defeat him it's written God promised me I could go to church and the pastor not me with all pray for me and I was pray for that's exactly what God would say what happened and it's written just go right on and refuse to have whatever the devil said it's written I'm gonna walk on in my healing because it's written it's written in the Bible your healing it's written here hallelujah it's already written it's there as Jesus would take what was written and defeat Satan you also take what's written the Brandon would talk about the young boy that was killed in Finland this is one of the things that so gripped me as I would ever first heard this story said he told about it for years I thought that was amazing brother brother Wayne talking about talking to somebody about this very story and him saying well it didn't happen like that and this and the man wasn't even there so how can you testify of something you didn't see so anyway by the way he's one of them backslidden preachers but anyway he but LeBron was say he was hit wrote it for two years to put it on the Flyleaf or your Bible it's gonna happen and before he knew it he was standing in the vision and not even realizing it and one of the brothers had walked up to the accident and he's like come back and just crying and just but Brandon who's not gonna believe this this boy is just mangled it's it's terrible he said it just tears me up cuz I also got a son over there his man was telling brother Brandon brother Brandon walks up there and he looks at the little boy and he said there was something familiar about him he said but I couldn't place and he said I turned around beginning to walk back to my vehicle and he said a hand grabbed a hold of me and he said I turned and when I turn I looked and I saw those lapping rocks and that hillside and all the things he said then he hit me I knew I was standing in that vision he said when I knew where I was standing he said you could lay it line ever devil up in hell and it could not keep it from coming to pass as hearing him this morning and why upended why I think Pentecost failed he said he said there's a fundamentalist and the Pentecost he said one knows they both have checks we said one knows there's a power there but they don't know who they are one knows who they are but they don't believe the powers there he said if we could ever get those two together he said we would see the miraculous take place hello somebody I thought the miraculous was taking place but now we got somebody that also knows this is who they are and not only do they know who they are they know there's power there to bring the pass what is spoken and if we could ever get those thing that time is now for the phenomenal for the miraculous why is the time now because now we're standing in the vision it's already been written I'll have a bride without spot without wrinkle it's already being written they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover it's already been written amen we're now standing where the prophecy was spoken and you can lie never gave up you can let that listen Satan is trying to bring his line up the best he's got alone brother Wayne said it he's trying to bring the best he's got into this age he's on capped Hill and brought thousand times thousands what is he trying to do to keep these people from realizing because he knows the last time those people realized here he'll was shook up on the day of Pentecost when there was a people that realized hey we're standing in what was written he said going to Jerusalem and I wouldn't do you with power on high it was a jubilee trumpet and they really hey this is that we are standing in what was written we are here now let's aim for the future this ain't for the past this is for the present how and when they realize where they were standing you can lie never devil though and he said they walked out of that Emperor and they walked to the gate called beautiful and there was a man who had been laying there how many times that they won't pass but now they know they're standing and they know there's power there walk to the gate called beautiful and they said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give on today in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk they were standing in the vision they were standing in what was written and here brother Branham is standing wanted been written on fly leaves for Bibles two years prior and now he realized I'm here they said Uriah never devil up he didn't gonna keep that boy from coming up if he ain't up in the next five minutes called me a false prophet he walks over there and lays his hand on him and the boy jumped to his feet alive not just alive but there wasn't a broken bone of his body full restoration full Redemption brought it right back why because he realized I'm standing where he was written in the never-failing word of god and i'm looking at a people this morning that's also standing where it is written and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet we are standing where's returned and the haters devil if he lines up we're just gonna walk over if he gets in our path we're just gonna go cold wow I've heard a trumpet sound I heard a trumpet sound I've heard the word of cloth and it said it is retired there is abroad upon the earth Satan be careful well standing where it is written we're standing is the stance of Lord and now I'm here at the gate of either like tabernacle and I say such as I have give either they rise up at the name of Jesus Christ take your god-given privileges Stan Traub fine was ever taken we're standing where's Ricky we're standing in the days of miracles we're standing in the days of signs of wonders we're standing in the days of crippled boys and girls that Satan has taken out there and wreck their lives and they're all mangled up but if we are standing in a familiar place in the place where all things are possible in the place where we shall speak and it will happen we're standing where it is written not ever devil oh he's not gonna keep our sons he's not gonna keep our daughters but we gotta speak the word and they're gonna rise up there won't be broken bones it'll be full restoration full redemption for so long you are standing where it's written all the Devils in him all the forces of evil cannot stop it the time is here that the spoken word of God is ready to come to pass if I was you this morning I

power the same yesterday today and forever put his those scarecrows up and say where you got rock-and-roll music you got this you see people's a little bit too loud they're too crazy they're too free why why is he putting those scarecrows up cuz he knows there's something good in there cuz he knows if they ever get in there what's going to happen to him what happened 2,000 years ago when they shook the kingdom of Satan and the Bible said these have turned the world upside down I'm looking at some people they're standing words written we're gonna turn the world upside down if you didn't

well I hate to bother you so much father heard this this morning he wants you to bother him well he does never never don't ever think that you can ever ask too much of God I believe the scripture says you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our choice would be for he wants you to ask abundantly ask for big things that was a big thing to ask somebody to bring you to the church this morning but God fulfilled his word that just don't happen a man asks for big things don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed going out here to some other kind of faith move out to the big things big things are just as easy to receive as little things ask big days it's just as easy to receive as little things you just have to believe could you imagine talking about the again exhaustible God's love and power and it's beneficiary to here could you imagine a little bitty fish about that long in the middle of the ocean selling that wait a minute I'd better consider this I better not drink of this water to much better go a little sparingly my run house he said that could be easily done more easy than you could ask too much of God he's the inexhaustible fountain of life and whatever you have need of ask him and believe he provided it in the redemptive blessings he died poured calvert and it give a promise to you for everything somebody see everything everything that you have needed while you're healing this journey it's yours how many can say it's mine it's mine he said could you imagine a little mouse and the grand partners of Egypt said wait a minute I better not eat with just two grains a day I might run out he says the way people act as Christians get up in the morning said God bless my family keep his clothes a man I've done my religion for the day he said I just like to lay in their presence and drink in because I know the more I drink in the more is going to come out and those little trees ever orange is in the tree that tall and a seed it's all there they just drink in push out drink in push out before you know it he's got a big shade and it's dropping fruit everywhere so blessed it can't even keep it all because it's been drinking in and pushing out drinking in and pushing out he says the believer now I mean a believer it's placed in Christ the inexhaustible fountain of life and the more you drink the more you're going to get and the more you're gonna push out if you can't believe you're so I believe Jesus saved me that's good how about the Holy Ghost keep believing divided healing just keep believing every depth of blessing when you receive the Holy Ghost everything you've got need up between here and glory is in you right there hello somebody the power to release your children is in you hallelujah the power to take a man that was crippled by Grieg they didn't have to call it from him and he was in there such as I have give on to thee [Applause] everything you have Nita is in you right there just release your faith if you got the Holy Spirit here's your faith the thing you'd have to know is how to use that faith let it go let it go exercise it said Lord you can do exceedingly abundant above all I could ever think or ask hallelujah he says people who talk there's no such a thing as the Holy Spirit they don't know what they're talking about people who talk they say they sir kind of services are over they don't know what they're talking about oh come on somebody he says just like that young boy peeling that Apple and that man begin to tell him they wouldn't know God he said I got to ask you a question this Apple Apple sweeter is it sour man said I don't know you're the one who eating this is just what I thought they want to say them services as a bunch of Azusa Street worked up Pentecost I'm the one that's eating this you don't know nothing about it but I know what is producing this assembly I know what it's produced around the world cancers have been healed how blood pressures have been healed sugar diabetes has been healed Amen I've seen it work time after time after time after time so you take your own unbelieving spirit back to where you want to go I'm happy where I am in the world that is written how do you be says how do you know when you haven't tasted the Lord how do you know when you haven't even received the Holy Ghost whether he's real or whether he's not how do you know whether there's faith or power how do you know this joy unspeakable and full of glory when you're never tasted it but you that's tasted it they are down in hell they can talk you out of it and say it ain't real they of devil in hell let's say that just a bunch of works go hey maybe you know that you know that you know and brother Jeremy they ain't no shame on me I witnessed it I've seen it and I'm honest live it and I'm gonna preach it to the day I leave here supersenses stirring it's power that stirs and drives something that makes you

just a work up it was a super sense it's a power that stirs and drives its faith say you got crippled hand you got pray for your hand you come up here and believe God is going to heal you the pastor prays for you the old natural man will say well my hand ain't no different you're no better than you ever was but the sixth sense comes in said that's a lie you've been prayed for it's over miss pirates hallelujah let that $0.06 loose what's the sixth sense Martha Mary was Martha ran out to see Jesus Lord but then the sixth sense if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you the sixth sense Jesus pulling himself together I am the resurrection of life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live who serve a living the believers in me shall never die believers out that doubt this what are you going to say are you going to reason oh there's a man laying down two dead worms crawling through he got through saying he was a resurrection in life that's God's Word the sixth sense beyond the doctor beyond the thoughts of science define at all defined reason casting it down it witnesses that God's Word is true I am the resurrection and life to the grave they went them two together and they walked away three Lazarus come forth because of sixth sense was there I believe the sixth sense is in the building this morning faith is here to believe all things are possible hallelujah don't look at your symptoms look to you Jesus turn your eyes to him I'm turning away from that I wonder how many
