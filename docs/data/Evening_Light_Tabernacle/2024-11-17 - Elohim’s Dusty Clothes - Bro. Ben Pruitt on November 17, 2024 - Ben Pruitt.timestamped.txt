[46:17] goodness in our lives and this goodness
[46:21] that he brings us and His blessings um
[46:24] they some sometimes just overflow and
[46:27] God just gives us great things and and
[46:30] this message produces great um great
[46:34] people great um families and great young
[46:39] people and we thank God for that we have
[46:42] today um sister Lauren Adams who we all
[46:47] know and been a part of this church not
[46:49] only um her uh her immediate family but
[46:53] then her grandparents and you know
[46:55] brother Jerry sh was um a um Deacon here
[46:59] at the church and sister Rachel's been
[47:02] uh just a real blessing to us through
[47:04] the years and a stalard Christian and
[47:07] supporter of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[47:09] so you know it's a great legacy and um
[47:12] you know but as things come along and I
[47:16] I remember some years ago now it's um
[47:19] I've been it seemed like day before
[47:22] yesterday it was brother Joe and sister
[47:25] Jessica pledging together and marriage
[47:27] and like I said the message produces
[47:30] great people and and and and wonderful
[47:34] wonderful children of God and in turn
[47:38] that produces great families and those
[47:41] great children and grow up and they also
[47:44] become um Born Again of the spirit
[47:47] because we can't pass this on
[47:49] intellectually or just because that we
[47:51] attended a church but you have to be
[47:53] born again because no matter how good a
[47:57] parents we had that does not give us a
[47:59] right to the kingdom of God we have to
[48:01] be everyone have that individual
[48:04] experience with God but anyway sister
[48:07] Lauren has you know come to a point in
[48:11] life and now has fallen in love and and
[48:15] uh there was a young man founder all the
[48:19] way from Kentucky and as brother Weston
[48:22] Powell and the Powell family are also a
[48:24] really wonderful family I've known I've
[48:27] known um the Mom's family for many years
[48:29] and and been friends of mine and so you
[48:32] know all this is just
[48:34] connections and the blessings of God so
[48:38] today I want to announce um sister
[48:41] Lauren Adams brother Weston Powell
[48:44] they're going to be pledging their
[48:45] wedding vows sometimes in the spring and
[48:48] so today we are just announcing the
[48:51] engagement upcoming marriage and giving
[48:54] thanks to the Lord if they'll just come
[48:56] down here just for a moment everybody
[48:58] know who they are and uh this also is a
[49:02] part of our records here just to you
[49:05] know as we just are so thankful For What
[49:08] the Lord Has Done His blessings has
[49:12] never failed us and they just keep on
[49:15] giving the blessings of God and amen
[49:18] what a wonderful thing that God does
[49:20] with young people it changes their lives
[49:23] transform them by the transforming power
[49:26] and and then you know when we get the
[49:29] Holy Ghost that's the greatest thing we
[49:30] could ever get is eternal life but then
[49:34] when we find the next best thing in life
[49:37] and that is a a mate a Godly mate I
[49:41] think about my own wife I I said to her
[49:45] many times I said everything that I have
[49:49] everything that I possess all the
[49:52] children I have even the church I said
[49:54] not discounting God and his great
[49:56] mercies and Grace
[49:58] but I would have had none of this
[50:00] without you because the wrong
[50:04] woman would have changed
[50:07] everything but you see when we wait on
[50:11] God and this is this is the real truth
[50:13] on marriage and divorce issues if you
[50:16] wait on God and you get a
[50:18] revelation then that's your mate
[50:22] forever amen there's there's there
[50:25] shouldn't be never no thing such as
[50:27] divorce in the in the house of the
[50:30] Living God it should always be we marry

[58:03] I'm here and thankful to brother Tim and
[58:06] brother Timothy for their friendship
[58:08] over the years and the friendship of
[58:11] this church and so I bring greetings
[58:12] from our church and brothers there and
[58:15] from Brother Joel and the other
[58:16] ministers there and um they're just glad
[58:19] to get a break for me this morning and
[58:22] uh I'm sure you all uh come you got such
[58:25] a wonderful pastor and ministry here in
[58:27] the church you know I feel like I'm
[58:29] coming in just as a spare tire but I
[58:32] believe God is still the same yesterday
[58:34] today and forever regardless of the
[58:36] preacher he's still able to do whatever
[58:40] he wants to do so we just want to give
[58:42] him Freedom today to do that that's our
[58:45] desire Genesis Chapter 18 and verse one
[58:48] we'll get right into the word today we
[58:50] enjoyed the Fall Festival yesterday my
[58:52] wife's here with me and my family and we
[58:54] sure enjoyed that and and just had a
[58:57] good time in the Lord Genesis 18:1 and
[59:00] the Lord appeared unto him in the plains
[59:03] of mamory and he sat in the tent Door In
[59:06] the Heat of the day and he lifted up his
[59:08] eyes and looked and lo three men stood
[59:10] by him and when he saw them he ran to
[59:13] meet them from the tent door and bowed
[59:16] himself toward the ground and said my
[59:19] Lord if now I have found favor in thy
[59:22] sight pass not away I pray thee from thy
[59:25] servant
[59:26] little water I pray you be fetched and
[59:28] wash your
[59:29] feet and rest yourself under the tree
[59:33] and I will fetch a morsel of bread and
[59:35] comfort you your hearts after that you
[59:37] shall pass on for therefore are you come
[59:40] to your servant and they said so do as
[59:43] thou has said I want to speak to you
[59:46] this morning on elohim's Dusty clothes
[59:48] you may be
[59:53] seated Abraham is sitting in the door of
[59:56] his tent in the afternoon heat thinking
[1:00:00] on the goodness of
[1:00:03] God I think it'd do us good to begin to
[1:00:06] reflect this morning as we begin on the
[1:00:09] goodness of God and he's looking around
[1:00:12] thinking about his life and the things
[1:00:14] that he's been through and and maybe
[1:00:16] even was thankful for the tree that he
[1:00:18] was sitting under as I know your pastors
[1:00:21] preached about that tree and and there
[1:00:24] there was a a restored tree that he
[1:00:26] could sit under when when the day is hot
[1:00:29] and I think we ought to be thankful for
[1:00:30] one another we ought to be thankful for
[1:00:33] the leaves of Fellowship that we have
[1:00:35] that we can draw a shade from that we
[1:00:39] ought to be thankful uh for the fact
[1:00:41] that we can come together on a Sunday
[1:00:43] morning and we got a place to come
[1:00:45] together and we got people to come
[1:00:47] together with it's easy to find
[1:00:50] something to pick at or to fuss or to
[1:00:52] fight with one another over but you know
[1:00:54] when sheep get hot they huddle together
[1:00:57] because they draw shade one from another
[1:00:59] and I think that's the way we ought to
[1:01:01] be in the message as a whole not just in
[1:01:04] this church or in in our church at home
[1:01:06] but I think we ought to be willing to
[1:01:08] come together and draw shade one from
[1:01:11] the other and and gain that Fellowship
[1:01:14] because we need one another we don't
[1:01:17] want to pick too much at one another or
[1:01:19] we'll end up devouring one another we
[1:01:21] Paul said be careful that you don't that
[1:01:24] you don't uh that you don't bite and and
[1:01:26] devour cuz he said you might be consumed
[1:01:29] of one another and if there's ever been
[1:01:31] an hour that we needed one another it's
[1:01:33] today if there's ever been an hour we
[1:01:35] ought to reflect on the goodness of God
[1:01:37] to bring us together it ought to be
[1:01:40] right now because we need one another
[1:01:43] more than we've ever needed one another
[1:01:47] Abraham had been strong in faith he had
[1:01:51] been a man that was uh willing to
[1:01:54] believe God
[1:01:56] whatever God spoke to him he just did
[1:01:59] what God Said I think that's the kind of
[1:02:02] people we ought to be today the kind of
[1:02:03] people that just believe God whatever
[1:02:06] God says that's what I'm going to do
[1:02:08] Lord I'm going to follow your word I'm
[1:02:10] if the word that's just what I'm going
[1:02:11] to do and so Abraham was that kind of a
[1:02:14] guy he just believed God and so he
[1:02:16] remembered how good God had been to him
[1:02:18] he remembered what it was like being in
[1:02:20] her the caldes and being just another
[1:02:23] guy and just another person that could
[1:02:25] thank you buddy just another uh just
[1:02:27] another Gentile like all the rest of
[1:02:29] them in that great Wicked City but he
[1:02:31] remembered hearing the voice of God that
[1:02:34] called him out of that place and called
[1:02:36] him and set him on a journey that would
[1:02:38] lead him to the promised land and I'm so
[1:02:40] grateful that I've been called out and
[1:02:42] you've been called out we've been LED on
[1:02:44] that same Journey a journey of faith
[1:02:46] that we've got to we're not done yet
[1:02:48] church we got a little little way left
[1:02:50] to go what are we going for we're headed
[1:02:52] to a body
[1:02:54] change we're going somewhere one of
[1:02:58] these mornings we're we're oh Church
[1:03:00] we're not going to be worried about old
[1:03:02] bodies anymore but it's going to change
[1:03:04] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:03:06] we're going to see our loved ones again
[1:03:09] and like Abraham we believe
[1:03:12] that Abraham sitting under the tree like
[1:03:14] we're sitting in the church this morning
[1:03:17] believing that God has done wonderful
[1:03:19] things for
[1:03:21] us now he's sitting there in the door of
[1:03:25] a house and there's there's another
[1:03:27] reason why he's in the door is because
[1:03:30] you know when things aren't real good in
[1:03:32] the
[1:03:33] tent you tend to go outside and and that
[1:03:37] morning Sarah was fussy brother brandham
[1:03:39] gives us that
[1:03:41] detail about Sarah she was fussy that
[1:03:44] morning like we are
[1:03:46] sometimes you come to church like that
[1:03:48] this morning you come fussy I see it on
[1:03:51] some of your faces ones that I can see
[1:03:54] cuz I forgot my glasses
[1:03:57] but I always forget something it's a
[1:03:59] running joke but but you you know you
[1:04:02] you you come fussy to church and so she
[1:04:05] wasn't ready for a visitation from God
[1:04:09] she wasn't ready to receive from the
[1:04:11] angel but Abraham was he he had the
[1:04:15] right attitude when he come to church
[1:04:17] but she had an attitude of of of
[1:04:19] fussiness she was she was worried about
[1:04:22] what lot was doing and what Lot's wife
[1:04:24] was doing and and what kind of dresses
[1:04:26] that they wore and and how that Abraham
[1:04:28] had brought them out in this dusty place
[1:04:30] in this in this hard harsh environment
[1:04:33] and she's sitting there worried about
[1:04:35] what everybody else is doing and she was
[1:04:37] looking at at what was happening down in
[1:04:39] Sodom but God was about to do something
[1:04:41] for her and about to do something for
[1:04:44] him that would completely change the
[1:04:46] trajectory of their
[1:04:48] life but Abraham was ready for it he was
[1:04:52] sitting in the tent door he wasn't he
[1:04:54] didn't mind what was going on behind in
[1:04:55] the T he was sitting in the tent door
[1:04:57] watching the
[1:04:59] road in the right atmosphere to receive
[1:05:03] from
[1:05:04] God Abraham had been strong in faith but
[1:05:07] he was full of
[1:05:08] mistakes that ought to give us Comfort
[1:05:11] today brother Bram said that about
[1:05:13] Abraham he was full of mistakes he he
[1:05:16] had all kinds of problems that he had he
[1:05:19] had said things he shouldn't have said
[1:05:20] lied about who his wife was and all
[1:05:22] kinds of different things that he did
[1:05:24] but when his Divine obituary was written
[1:05:27] in Romans chapter 4 the story of his
[1:05:29] life was written it wasn't even
[1:05:31] mentioned in it said he staggered not at
[1:05:33] the promise of God he did not waver in
[1:05:35] the midst of battle don't you want that
[1:05:37] to be your story when you get to the end
[1:05:39] of it when it's written about you he
[1:05:41] staggered not he was a Believer he stood
[1:05:43] for the message of the
[1:05:47] hour he did not waver in the midst of
[1:05:49] battle he grew stronger every day that's
[1:05:53] that's marvelous
[1:05:55] he had been tested and tried but he made
[1:05:58] it that's
[1:06:00] right he was 99 years
[1:06:04] old now that's
[1:06:08] old even back then that was
[1:06:11] old and he stood when lot left when
[1:06:15] Sarah was
[1:06:16] grouchy when when his own body broke
[1:06:19] down and you know a Abraham's body was
[1:06:22] testifying against him
[1:06:26] right his body was testifying you're old
[1:06:29] but he was testifying I'm going to have
[1:06:31] a
[1:06:32] child right his his circumstances were
[1:06:35] testifying against him but Abraham
[1:06:37] determined no matter what the rest of
[1:06:39] them says what no matter what the rest
[1:06:41] of them do as for me in my house we will
[1:06:44] serve God I wonder how many of you young
[1:06:46] people would make that determination
[1:06:48] today how many of you families would
[1:06:50] make that determination this young
[1:06:52] couple that just got engaged make a
[1:06:53] determination as for me in my house
[1:06:56] we're going to serve God we're going to
[1:06:58] follow God we're going to do what's
[1:07:00] right thank you
[1:07:04] buddy now I can
[1:07:08] see if the rest of them says there's
[1:07:10] nothing to the experience brother BR
[1:07:12] said it's a bunch of excitement as for
[1:07:13] me and my house will'll serve God though
[1:07:16] there be tattlers coming to church I
[1:07:19] know this doesn't happen here but just
[1:07:20] other places though there be tattlers
[1:07:23] coming to church though there be
[1:07:24] Twisters though they there be all kinds
[1:07:26] of false prophets and everything coming
[1:07:27] to the church in the amongst the people
[1:07:29] in the neighborhood and everything but
[1:07:30] for me in my house we'll serve the Lord
[1:07:33] he said though all of them quit coming
[1:07:34] though the church gets cold and
[1:07:36] different me and my house will serve the
[1:07:38] Lord listen he's not going to Rapture us
[1:07:40] as a church he's not going to Rapture us
[1:07:42] as a group of people he's going to
[1:07:44] Rapture individuals our bodies are going
[1:07:47] to be changed individually and you got
[1:07:49] to make a determination I'm going to
[1:07:51] stand if all the other young people
[1:07:52] don't stand I'm going to believe if all
[1:07:54] the other people don't believe I'm going
[1:07:56] to preach if everybody else quits
[1:07:58] preaching and everybody follows the
[1:08:00] trend of the age I'm going to keep doing
[1:08:01] what God called me to
[1:08:05] do maybe I should have left my glasses
[1:08:11] off are you with me this
[1:08:14] morning though somebody was prayed for
[1:08:18] he said and didn't get well that has
[1:08:19] nothing to do with it for me in my house
[1:08:21] we serve the
[1:08:22] Lord that's the attitude that Abraham
[1:08:25] had
[1:08:26] and God had revealed himself to Abraham
[1:08:28] in Genesis 17 as the almighty God when
[1:08:31] he was 9 and9 years old the Lord
[1:08:33] appeared to Abram said to him I am the
[1:08:34] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[1:08:38] perfect and brother brandham tells us
[1:08:40] that Abraham believed God then because
[1:08:43] he had an approach through a symbol
[1:08:46] through a name but he said we do as well
[1:08:50] he said so have we an approach through a
[1:08:52] name Jesus what does Jesus mean to us
[1:08:56] savior amen else should I to Abraham
[1:08:59] satisfier strong one salvation Giver
[1:09:01] strength Giver the same thing that El
[1:09:03] shouldi was to Abraham Jesus is to the
[1:09:07] believer do you understand that this
[1:09:08] morning he's our strength Giver he's our
[1:09:10] strong one he's our salvation giver why
[1:09:13] was Abraham in the condition that he was
[1:09:15] in because he had met elai and he was
[1:09:18] drawing strength to become stronger
[1:09:20] every day in faith to believe when the
[1:09:22] miracle took
[1:09:24] place so brother BR said when Christians
[1:09:27] begin to get that Satan begins to get
[1:09:29] ready to leave you don't you love it
[1:09:31] when Satan starts packing
[1:09:33] up don't you love to see the devil start
[1:09:36] packing up aren't you ready in your
[1:09:38] house or in your life or whatever is
[1:09:40] going on for the devil to start packing
[1:09:42] his bags he said when Christians begin
[1:09:44] to get that he's finished when people
[1:09:46] say I don't care no matter no certain
[1:09:48] healer has to come by no certain this
[1:09:50] has to happen the only thing I want on
[1:09:52] Earth to hear is that God said so and
[1:09:54] that settles with me right then I'll
[1:09:56] take it and go from there oh that's my
[1:09:59] desire today I want to know that God
[1:10:01] said
[1:10:02] so
[1:10:04] Hallelujah Abraham had to have this
[1:10:07] Revelation so he would
[1:10:09] recognize the power that this this
[1:10:13] Elohim had when he come down and
[1:10:16] appeared in flesh now he appeared to
[1:10:19] Abraham in this name and while he
[1:10:21] appeared to him in this name and Abraham
[1:10:23] recognized who he was he changed
[1:10:25] Abraham's
[1:10:27] name he he put a part of his own name in
[1:10:30] Abraham's
[1:10:31] name and brother BR says now he's come
[1:10:34] to the fullness of
[1:10:37] believing the fullness of oh church I
[1:10:41] believe that's where we're at I believe
[1:10:43] we're in the fullness of believing we
[1:10:45] got to come to a place where we believe
[1:10:46] all the word of God see he said where
[1:10:49] the church has come he said I hope you
[1:10:50] can read between the lines come up to
[1:10:52] the place where he's revealed to him who
[1:10:53] he was and then he changed Abraham's
[1:10:56] name so that the promise could be
[1:10:58] fulfilled and Abraham is sitting there
[1:11:01] under his tree and the door of his tent
[1:11:03] In the Heat of the day pondering these
[1:11:08] things thinking about the goodness of
[1:11:13] God God you've been good to me and my
[1:11:16] family I just add my testimony to that
[1:11:19] brother Jo God you've been good to me
[1:11:20] and my family oh you you say you brought
[1:11:23] me out you kept me from so many things
[1:11:25] you've forgiven me of so many oh you've
[1:11:27] been good to
[1:11:30] me Abraham just rejoicing in his Spirit
[1:11:34] as he sits there in the door of the tent
[1:11:35] brother
[1:11:36] brandham then gives us a very
[1:11:38] interesting detail which is where I want
[1:11:40] to go
[1:11:42] today about these men that come these
[1:11:45] three men that come walking down the
[1:11:47] road toward
[1:11:49] Abraham and he tells us this he said he
[1:11:52] kept looking down to them he said now
[1:11:54] these are strange fellows they're Dusty
[1:11:59] they're Dusty traveled
[1:12:02] far and whenever you hear Brother bham
[1:12:04] tell this he tells it in dozens of
[1:12:06] places he always calls our attention to
[1:12:09] the detail of the Dust he said when the
[1:12:13] hour of the message came he looked out
[1:12:14] in the heat of the day he seen three men
[1:12:17] coming up dust all over their
[1:12:20] clothes and Abraham looked again he knew
[1:12:22] there was just something about it he
[1:12:24] said a real Born Again child of God
[1:12:26] knows the spirit of God when it
[1:12:29] strikes yes sir my sheep know my voice
[1:12:32] ELO him had dust on his clothes now when
[1:12:37] they brother BR said when they set him
[1:12:38] down there though they didn't look any
[1:12:40] different from any other men because
[1:12:43] they were dressed dust on their clothes
[1:12:47] and come from some other country
[1:12:50] probably their feet Dusty and their
[1:12:52] clothes ragged but Abraham knew inside
[1:12:56] there there was something real the
[1:13:00] spirit declared it he said why he kept
[1:13:02] himself in a spiritual
[1:13:05] atmosphere all the
[1:13:07] time brother B says something wonderful
[1:13:09] here he says that he could recognize
[1:13:11] right from wrong all the time now
[1:13:15] sometimes I know uh when I deal with
[1:13:17] young people when you deal with young
[1:13:18] families I find that the reason they
[1:13:20] don't recognize right from wrong the
[1:13:23] reason they come to a pastor for
[1:13:25] counseling sometimes and they and
[1:13:27] they'll ask you can I do this and you're
[1:13:28] like what why would you ever
[1:13:31] think that would be
[1:13:35] okay adultery is never going to be okay
[1:13:37] smoking's never going to be okay
[1:13:39] drinking's never going to be okay even
[1:13:42] part-time it's never going to be
[1:13:45] okay but the reason they can't tell the
[1:13:48] difference between right from wrong is
[1:13:51] because they're not in a spiritual
[1:13:52] atmosphere and that's what brother BR
[1:13:54] said Abraham was in a spiritual
[1:13:56] atmosphere he could tell the difference
[1:13:58] listen to me young people you need to
[1:13:59] keep yourself in a spiritual atmosphere
[1:14:02] the reason why that you fell for that
[1:14:04] and you didn't understand that was wrong
[1:14:05] is you weren't in a spiritual atmosphere
[1:14:07] to begin with Netflix won't put you into
[1:14:10] that Call of Duty won't put you into
[1:14:12] that there's got to be something uh in
[1:14:14] your heart that desires the presence of
[1:14:16] God the power of God you need to be in a
[1:14:19] spiritual atmosphere not just on Sunday
[1:14:21] listen this is this our religion is not
[1:14:23] just about church the message didn't
[1:14:25] come just to make us a good church the
[1:14:27] message come that we could live the
[1:14:28] message we could be the message in our
[1:14:30] homes in our factories in our
[1:14:39] schools Tim said take my Liberty so I'm
[1:14:42] just preaching like I would at home so
[1:14:43] y'all y'all forgive me this
[1:14:46] morning I'm not an evangelist I God
[1:14:49] called me to be a pastor and I thank God
[1:14:51] for that cuz I'd have a tough time as an
[1:14:54] evangelist but but I'm so glad that God
[1:14:56] puts us where he needs
[1:14:58] us
[1:15:00] Abraham listen looks at
[1:15:02] them and he says brother BR says this
[1:15:05] about the dusty clothes over and over
[1:15:08] again now you might ask the question
[1:15:11] well how does brother brandham know
[1:15:12] their clothes are dusty well Abraham
[1:15:14] washed their
[1:15:16] feet right and they didn't wash their
[1:15:19] feet just as a honor or something like
[1:15:21] that because they had dirt on
[1:15:23] them right and it's really hard hard to
[1:15:25] get your feet dirty without your clothes
[1:15:26] being
[1:15:27] dirty they were dirty all over that's
[1:15:31] the I mean you can find a more
[1:15:32] Supernatural version if you want to but
[1:15:35] that's basically why now look and and
[1:15:38] brother Brown may have seen that I don't
[1:15:40] know but but there was there was dust on
[1:15:43] their
[1:15:44] feet and and somehow he
[1:15:47] recognized through that
[1:15:49] dust that this was God you you find the
[1:15:52] same thing happening when Jesus on the
[1:15:55] earth and he come down in a body of
[1:15:57] Flesh that looked like any other human
[1:15:59] being looked like any other looked like
[1:16:02] any other guy and yet he was sitting
[1:16:04] there he brother random tells us in one
[1:16:05] place he didn't look like a leader he
[1:16:08] wasn't tall and handsome and great he
[1:16:10] didn't look like a ceser he didn't look
[1:16:11] like a general he looked like just an
[1:16:13] ordinary Jew an ordinary man and he's
[1:16:16] sitting there but but and the and the
[1:16:18] Pharisees didn't recognize him and even
[1:16:20] the disciples sometimes struggled with
[1:16:22] it but here was a prostitute woman who
[1:16:25] never even thought about it before she
[1:16:27] never had any kind of an idea of who
[1:16:29] Jesus was but when she saw him brother B
[1:16:32] said she was attracted by the scent to
[1:16:34] Simon's house where he was sitting you
[1:16:35] remember the story she was attracted by
[1:16:38] the S of the lamb and when she gets up
[1:16:40] there what happens she begins to see him
[1:16:44] and when she saw saw him brother the
[1:16:45] Peter she saw there was something
[1:16:47] different about him she said this is not
[1:16:49] just an ordinary man this is him she saw
[1:16:53] through the dust on his clothes through
[1:16:55] the dust on his feet and said you know
[1:16:57] what I'm going to do I'm going to wash
[1:16:58] the dust off of his feet I'm going to
[1:17:01] get out and worship him I'm going to
[1:17:03] make him
[1:17:04] welcome Oh Glory to God oh it ought to
[1:17:07] be something we're all willing to do it
[1:17:09] ought to be something every one of us
[1:17:11] was willing to do to do a service for
[1:17:14] him brother BR said Noti she had a
[1:17:16] service to do for him she had heard of
[1:17:18] him now she seen him with her eyes she
[1:17:20] had a service to do and she had nothing
[1:17:21] to do it with so she rushed rushed
[1:17:24] forward anyhow to the service God
[1:17:26] furnished the water in towels to wash
[1:17:29] his
[1:17:30] feet Hallelujah where' the water come
[1:17:33] from from her eyes what was the tow her
[1:17:37] glory her hair she laid all of her glory
[1:17:41] down in his feet oh let me do that today
[1:17:44] if there's any Glory if there's any
[1:17:46] praise let me lay it down at his
[1:17:52] feet she had have heard of a Living God
[1:17:55] but now she's seen him with her eyes she
[1:17:57] knew it was him an inspiration struck
[1:17:59] and said this is the messenger he needed
[1:18:02] a service she had nothing to serve him
[1:18:03] by his feet was dirty but she rushed
[1:18:05] forward anyhow to do him a service
[1:18:07] because she was inspired to do
[1:18:10] it oh
[1:18:11] my something she'd never thought
[1:18:15] about something in her
[1:18:18] subconscious you know all of us can
[1:18:21] serve God
[1:18:22] consciously right we we can make our our
[1:18:24] El do it we can have faith consciously
[1:18:29] and that's good but when you serve him
[1:18:32] without thinking about it when you love
[1:18:35] people without thinking about it when
[1:18:37] you worship without thinking about it
[1:18:40] without a plan for it when it just
[1:18:43] happens it breaks out and you don't need
[1:18:45] music you don't need nothing you just
[1:18:47] you just start to worship God there's
[1:18:49] something happening in your Pew what is
[1:18:51] it you met him and and you didn't have
[1:18:53] anything to worship him with but he
[1:18:55] provided the things that you needed he's
[1:18:58] giving you your hands he's giving you
[1:18:59] your voice worship him when he
[1:19:04] comes but something in her subconscious
[1:19:06] realm compelled her to do it I think of
[1:19:10] the thief on the cross you remember I
[1:19:11] don't have time to go through all of
[1:19:12] this but it just comes to my mind
[1:19:14] today the thief on the cross was hanging
[1:19:17] there remember he was a type of Joseph
[1:19:19] in the Old Testament the Butler and the
[1:19:21] baker they both had a dream remember
[1:19:24] both had a dream and one of them was
[1:19:26] lost and one of them was saved neither
[1:19:28] one of them knew what the dream meant
[1:19:30] but the dream comes from the
[1:19:31] subconscious realm and they didn't know
[1:19:34] what it meant and on the thief on the
[1:19:36] cross he was hanging there and the one
[1:19:38] Thief said if you were the Christ you
[1:19:40] would come down off the
[1:19:41] cross and the other one not because he
[1:19:45] thought about it not because he prepared
[1:19:48] himself for it not because he was taught
[1:19:50] well brother brandom tells us he never
[1:19:52] had a thought about God before in his
[1:19:54] life listen to me you may be sitting
[1:19:55] here this morning and you've never had a
[1:19:58] conscious thought about God but I
[1:19:59] believe you're here today because
[1:20:01] somewhere in the subconscious realm
[1:20:03] somewhere in there there's a dream of
[1:20:05] your life a vision something that has to
[1:20:07] be expressed in your life this the oh
[1:20:10] Church the thief had a seed down on the
[1:20:12] inside there was something there that
[1:20:14] belonged to God he didn't even know
[1:20:16] about it he oh church he didn't have
[1:20:19] anything to do with it that's the way I
[1:20:21] got saved that's the way you'll get
[1:20:22] saved he didn't have nothing to do with
[1:20:24] it and God reached down where he was and
[1:20:26] said today you'll be with me in
[1:20:28] Paradise
[1:20:30] subconsciously that's the way it
[1:20:34] happened this the way Abraham recognized
[1:20:36] these men it's the way the The
[1:20:39] Prostitute
[1:20:40] recognized
[1:20:42] Jesus Oh
[1:20:44] My but the brand said the guests didn't
[1:20:46] know him they was ashamed of him because
[1:20:51] he was
[1:20:52] dirty he had dirt on his clothes
[1:20:56] he smelled bad that's the way it is
[1:20:58] today oh
[1:21:00] church I I come to you my heart's burden
[1:21:03] today because I want to I want to defend
[1:21:06] and not because it needs to be defended
[1:21:08] here because I know it has been many
[1:21:09] times but because it's in my heart I
[1:21:12] want to defend what God has done for us
[1:21:14] in our hour I want to defend the message
[1:21:16] of the hour it's it's still they put him
[1:21:18] off in the corner and put him in in a
[1:21:20] dirty place but I didn't when I receiv
[1:21:22] received the message of the hour it was
[1:21:23] more than a prophet it was more just a
[1:21:26] man but it was the word could come down
[1:21:28] in our age the Christ hitting Among Us
[1:21:31] and he come down not just in not just in
[1:21:33] mechanics but in Dynamics but the par
[1:21:36] said he is the Dynamics and he come down
[1:21:39] Among
[1:21:41] Us and they throw dirt on him
[1:21:46] yet he said they pile all the dirt they
[1:21:48] can upon it call it holy rollers and
[1:21:50] everything else they can think of nobody
[1:21:51] does nothing about it oh my there he
[1:21:55] sets Dirty Feet Wallflower at the party
[1:21:57] Wallflower in a religious meeting
[1:21:59] invited we ask him to come for a Revival
[1:22:01] when he comes we treat him the same way
[1:22:02] they did there he come and identify him
[1:22:04] something nobody wants nothing to do
[1:22:06] with
[1:22:07] him oh
[1:22:09] church I'm not trying to make you feel
[1:22:11] bad I don't want to move you just out of
[1:22:13] emotion but come on
[1:22:15] church can can you see him and we
[1:22:18] realize there's something we can do for
[1:22:20] Christ in our age we can worship him we
[1:22:23] can make sure
[1:22:25] that the church is open we can we can
[1:22:27] pay our tithes and our offerings we can
[1:22:29] we can go to the house of God with a
[1:22:30] cheerful heart and and give with the
[1:22:32] cheer and love people with all of our
[1:22:34] heart and not get caught up in all kinds
[1:22:36] of fights and fusses and squabbles we
[1:22:38] have a responsibility to
[1:22:40] that
[1:22:42] sir in my area I live an hour and a half
[1:22:45] from Jonesboro and Jonesboro Arkansas is
[1:22:47] where the great meetings were held BR
[1:22:50] said the greatest Miracles that ever
[1:22:51] took place aside from over he said we're
[1:22:55] right there in Jonesboro
[1:22:56] Arkansas God visited that place and I
[1:23:00] told our church I said we're
[1:23:02] responsible we are responsible we've
[1:23:05] heard too much preaching we've heard
[1:23:07] we've had too many things come by our
[1:23:08] way we're responsible we're responsible
[1:23:11] to present the right side to present the
[1:23:13] right thing to the people not to be some
[1:23:15] kind of a cold dead formal thing not to
[1:23:18] be some kind of a some kind of
[1:23:20] fanaticism but to be what God called us
[1:23:22] to be we're respons responsible to the
[1:23:25] message of the hour God done so much for
[1:23:28] us he' never have to do anything again
[1:23:29] to make you
[1:23:30] responsible some of you Elders know
[1:23:33] right here in shreport God did so
[1:23:35] much huh you're responsible remember
[1:23:38] capernium in the Bible I don't know why
[1:23:40] I'm going this direction but you
[1:23:41] remember capernium was was capernium was
[1:23:44] considered to be a place where Jesus did
[1:23:47] many of his mighty works it's where he
[1:23:50] lived for a while he resided in
[1:23:52] capernium and Jesus said it was worth
[1:23:54] worse than Sodom worse than Sodom CU
[1:23:57] what they turn down that's right I said
[1:23:59] God help us today as message people that
[1:24:02] we would not our punishment would not be
[1:24:03] worse than Sodom but that we would be
[1:24:05] the Bride of Jesus
[1:24:08] Christ we've heard
[1:24:11] it we're
[1:24:13] responsible to
[1:24:16] it I personally sat with people who were
[1:24:19] in the meetings and talk to them and
[1:24:21] know what happened and I've experienced
[1:24:24] against God for
[1:24:26] myself I am
[1:24:28] responsible our church is responsible I
[1:24:31] believe this church who's responsible we
[1:24:33] got to wash his feet that's
[1:24:35] right he came to
[1:24:38] Abraham notice he did not come as a
[1:24:40] Celestial
[1:24:42] being right he could have come with
[1:24:46] great big
[1:24:47] wings and a halo over his head and a
[1:24:51] great big sword and then anybody could
[1:24:54] have looked but Jonah said that's
[1:24:57] Elohim right but there were many times
[1:24:59] he maybe would have come in that way
[1:25:01] maybe he'd come in a different ways but
[1:25:04] then this time he chose to come as a
[1:25:08] Dusty
[1:25:09] traveler he had on clothes like a man
[1:25:13] dust all over
[1:25:16] him come from a far country but Abraham
[1:25:21] saw God face to face now again this
[1:25:25] wasn't just an angel this was God who
[1:25:27] created a body and come down Elohim we
[1:25:31] call him Elohim is the creator of all
[1:25:33] things the one who existed by himself
[1:25:36] and right
[1:25:38] Elohim the all powerful
[1:25:41] one dust on his clothes see it takes the
[1:25:45] faith of Abraham to see past the dust
[1:25:49] now it was not extraordinary that dust
[1:25:51] would be there in fact it was a very
[1:25:52] ordinary thing
[1:25:55] right it was it it would it would fit
[1:25:58] the narrative for there to be
[1:26:02] dust right if someone had come down and
[1:26:05] told Abraham now this is not who you
[1:26:07] think it is this is just a man they
[1:26:11] could have proved that
[1:26:15] scientifically by the
[1:26:17] dust right because they would have said
[1:26:19] well if he come from Heaven why is he
[1:26:22] Dusty
[1:26:27] that's a good question isn't it why is
[1:26:28] he
[1:26:29] Dusty if he come from heaven and some of
[1:26:32] y'all think about the message like that
[1:26:33] some people think about their pastors
[1:26:34] like that or preachers like that well if
[1:26:36] they come from
[1:26:41] Heaven huh if these are predestined
[1:26:45] officers of God why do they why are they
[1:26:50] human why can't they take my calls at
[1:26:53] 3:00 in the morning you know
[1:26:55] they probably will
[1:26:58] but why do they get grouchy
[1:27:02] sometimes come on church I'm putting off
[1:27:04] on us so you'll understand it's all of
[1:27:06] us
[1:27:07] right right but why do we get that way
[1:27:09] sometime why do we why do we struggle
[1:27:11] with those things God chose
[1:27:17] dust I don't know how he did that
[1:27:19] brother Tim he he he he he caused them
[1:27:21] to have dust on their clothes I don't
[1:27:22] know because all he did is make him
[1:27:24] himself a body I don't know if he made
[1:27:25] himself a body and then said now you
[1:27:26] angel you go over here you go over here
[1:27:28] and wormwood goes over here and Gabriel
[1:27:30] goes over here pick up some dust and
[1:27:32] throw it on
[1:27:34] me I don't know if they if they if they
[1:27:37] transferred to another dimension 20
[1:27:39] miles away so they could get Dusty don't
[1:27:41] know how it happened all I know is
[1:27:46] somehow there was a human element on
[1:27:49] what they were
[1:27:50] wearing that appeared to be evidence
[1:27:53] that they weren't what they said they
[1:27:58] were everybody day is looking for
[1:28:00] evidence aren't they everybody says
[1:28:02] evidence or didn't happen they take
[1:28:04] brother Brand's quotes and try to use
[1:28:05] them against each other they take they
[1:28:07] try to set up websites and everything
[1:28:09] else and try to take the all kinds of
[1:28:12] different things and and try to make it
[1:28:14] this won't work against this and this
[1:28:15] against that hey you didn't have to tell
[1:28:18] Abraham that they were Dusty he knew
[1:28:20] they were Dusty he washed the dust off
[1:28:23] but he
[1:28:24] recognized oh church can we recognize
[1:28:27] underneath the dust there's an Elohim
[1:28:29] there's a God who's still able to meet
[1:28:31] our
[1:28:35] needs he was
[1:28:37] Dusty everyone's looking for that
[1:28:39] evidence of well of
[1:28:41] deity right but what they find is dust
[1:28:46] and they they they did the same thing to
[1:28:48] Jesus if you are who you say you are
[1:28:50] prove it and and the evidence showed he
[1:28:53] was just a man but he was God in
[1:28:56] flesh come on Church you better watch
[1:28:58] you say well if the evidence if the
[1:29:00] science shows I'll believe it well the
[1:29:02] science said a few years ago that if you
[1:29:03] went up faster than 30 m an hour you'd
[1:29:05] roll off the end of the Earth that's
[1:29:08] what science said science at one time
[1:29:10] said the Earth was flat and then they
[1:29:11] said it was round listen science says
[1:29:13] all kinds of things science got to learn
[1:29:16] science brought us Co I'll just drop
[1:29:18] that
[1:29:21] there you know that someone said that
[1:29:23] that Engineers built the Titanic
[1:29:25] amateurs built the
[1:29:29] ark right but it was amateurs who
[1:29:31] believe God's word who took God in his
[1:29:34] word who didn't care about the Dust they
[1:29:36] willing to look past the
[1:29:37] [Applause]
[1:29:39] dust I know my caller's out as a new
[1:29:46] shirt listen it was God hiding himself
[1:29:50] and Abraham calls out my
[1:29:52] Lord oh Church brother B said was the
[1:29:55] effect of the revelation of who God
[1:30:00] was oh Church you need to go back and
[1:30:02] listen to Jehovah Gyra and and some of
[1:30:04] these sermons brother Brandon preached
[1:30:05] about this he began to preach about he
[1:30:07] said that was the effect of the
[1:30:08] revelation of who God was of el Shai of
[1:30:11] the of the strong one of the almighty
[1:30:13] God the effect of that Revelation what
[1:30:15] it did to Abraham after his name was
[1:30:17] changed from Abram to Abraham he seen
[1:30:19] three men coming and he called the three
[1:30:21] one my
[1:30:22] Lord Hallelujah lot said my Lord he was
[1:30:25] a denominational believer but Abraham
[1:30:27] said my Lord why he saw past the dust
[1:30:30] and saw who it
[1:30:32] was Abraham's vision and Revelation
[1:30:35] showed him he was the all sufficient
[1:30:37] Elohim he said his seed is to receive
[1:30:39] the same thing said we're made out of 16
[1:30:42] elements petroleum Cosmic light and
[1:30:43] potach and calcium and so forth Just 16
[1:30:45] elements he just caught it together they
[1:30:49] had dust on their clothes but they were
[1:30:50] made out of
[1:30:52] dust right he just caught the dust
[1:30:55] together Hallelujah breathed into
[1:31:00] it and walked on the earth brother brand
[1:31:04] said I'm so glad he's that sort of a
[1:31:06] father aren't you glad he's that sort of
[1:31:08] a father today though the skin worms
[1:31:11] destroy this body yet he'll call you he
[1:31:14] promised to do it he's Zeo
[1:31:16] him I remember when I was very young I
[1:31:18] thought my dad could do anything he was
[1:31:21] that sort of father but as I got older I
[1:31:24] begin to see his humanity and I begin to
[1:31:26] realize he didn't you know and I got
[1:31:28] about 16 he didn't know
[1:31:30] anything and then got a little older and
[1:31:32] said realize he knew some
[1:31:35] things right just like all of you but
[1:31:39] you remember I don't know if you you can
[1:31:40] recall that feeling that Dad can do
[1:31:43] anything we all have that feeling about
[1:31:46] God he told Abraham he said is there
[1:31:48] anything too hard for God if you look up
[1:31:51] that word hard it's actually miraculous
[1:31:53] wonderful the word is wonderful
[1:31:55] wonderful is there anything too
[1:31:56] wonderful for God and we're told his
[1:31:58] name is
[1:32:00] wonderful Hallelujah if that's his name
[1:32:03] if you got a revelation of his name you
[1:32:05] should know who he is he's able to
[1:32:08] deliver from cancer he's able to deliver
[1:32:10] from diabetes he's able to heal heart
[1:32:12] trouble he's able to change a drunken
[1:32:15] man into a sober man he's able to give
[1:32:17] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's
[1:32:19] able to to set up a church and and make
[1:32:22] it what it ought to be he's able to do

[1:32:25] morning church he's able to do
[1:32:30] it he promised he'd do it said I'm so
[1:32:32] glad he's that sword of Father though
[1:32:34] the skin worms destroy this body yet
[1:32:35] he'll call you he promised to do it he's
[1:32:37] Elohim and Abraham after the Revelation
[1:32:39] he's seen it he knew there was one God
[1:32:41] and he seen he said my Lord come aside
[1:32:43] sit down let me wash your feet the
[1:32:46] message of a of a body change came from
[1:32:48] a messenger with dust on his clothes see
[1:32:51] God hides
[1:32:52] himself in
[1:32:54] dust our bodies are literally made from
[1:32:58] dirt brother BR said our bodies were on
[1:32:59] the earth before there was any life here
[1:33:02] we are made of 16 different elements of
[1:33:04] the earth he said that great Jehovah God
[1:33:08] he said he just reached over and got a
[1:33:10] handful of atoms got a little light and
[1:33:13] poured it in like this and went a body
[1:33:17] and just stepped right into it say come
[1:33:20] here Gabriel I know you've heard this
[1:33:22] before but just think about it now and
[1:33:25] think about it I just want you to think
[1:33:27] about it in the aspect of the Dust right
[1:33:30] that's what he
[1:33:32] used right he he said step into that God
[1:33:35] and two angels walk down there in human
[1:33:36] flesh drink the milk from a cow eat the
[1:33:38] butter out of the milk eat some
[1:33:39] cornbread boy it's good
[1:33:41] eating I had some cornbread yesterday
[1:33:43] that's good stuff God liked it
[1:33:48] so come on he
[1:33:52] ate what happened to those bodies now
[1:33:55] look when he leaves Abraham they just
[1:33:57] turn back to dust he drops the dust and
[1:34:00] he steps back into another dimension
[1:34:02] brother BR said that same one could just
[1:34:05] reach and grab a handful of calcium and
[1:34:07] poish and go and there you are
[1:34:11] again Hallelujah and my name is on his
[1:34:15] book oh aren't you glad for that
[1:34:17] today Hallelujah he said what do I care
[1:34:20] this ought to make us older folks feel
[1:34:22] good those of us who are getting older
[1:34:24] what do I care how stoop my shoulders
[1:34:25] are getting how old I get certainly not
[1:34:28] not a bit of worry he'll say
[1:34:32] children to God oh I'm looking forward
[1:34:36] to that one day I'm looking forward to
[1:34:38] the day when we see our loved ones again
[1:34:40] he said children there they
[1:34:43] are he's done it
[1:34:46] before glory to God if he did it for oh
[1:34:49] true if he did it for Abraham he'll do
[1:34:51] it for you and me He said there will be
[1:34:54] in his maid in his likeness Young
[1:34:56] Forever old ages passed away sickness
[1:34:59] troubl Sorrows has vanished glory be to
[1:35:01] the Living
[1:35:03] God we just don't need to get too
[1:35:06] discouraged by the
[1:35:14] dust it was dust on our prophet's
[1:35:16] clothes if we can say it that way we
[1:35:19] could
[1:35:20] understand I I thought of this the
[1:35:23] Lord's kind of spoke to me I was going
[1:35:26] through
[1:35:27] Jeffersonville in a dry time a year just
[1:35:29] earlier this year and and the Tabernacle
[1:35:32] I drove by it and there was dust all
[1:35:35] over the outside of the
[1:35:37] building and I was remembered again how
[1:35:40] small it
[1:35:41] was and how humble it
[1:35:44] was and how it looked like nothing was
[1:35:46] going to happen brother Brandon passed
[1:35:47] away it was just all
[1:35:49] over and today there's millions of
[1:35:51] people around the world who at least
[1:35:52] claim to believe the
[1:35:54] message how did that
[1:35:56] happen God stepped into
[1:36:01] dust I want you to understand I'm not
[1:36:03] just talking about a man talking about
[1:36:08] you are you with me now don't get
[1:36:11] discouraged by the dust brother Brandon
[1:36:14] was human he had a wife and children he
[1:36:16] worried about things he was nervous but
[1:36:20] God did more through that body than he
[1:36:21] had any other man up to that time
[1:36:25] brother BR say he saw more miracles in
[1:36:27] his ministry come on church we still
[1:36:29] believe that more miracles in his
[1:36:31] ministry than he did even when he was on
[1:36:32] the earth why because it was longer it
[1:36:34] was in more
[1:36:35] [Music]
[1:36:36] places right the same
[1:36:39] God but what went you out for to see
[1:36:42] Jesus said even this about John John was
[1:36:44] the Forerunner that's the type of of our
[1:36:47] Elijah he said yeah I S you more than a
[1:36:50] prophet he was dust yes but he was more
[1:36:53] than
[1:36:54] that amen look out there brother BR said
[1:36:57] he went out there Abraham went out there
[1:36:58] and said there's something about that
[1:37:00] man I've heard that voice before see
[1:37:03] when we heard the message we didn't just
[1:37:05] hear a man's voice I know people they
[1:37:08] try to make that literal voice the voice
[1:37:09] of God that's not what it is but you'd
[1:37:12] already heard a
[1:37:13] voice right the voice of
[1:37:16] predestination right spoke into your
[1:37:18] life and then when you heard the voice
[1:37:20] on the earth of God the word of God
[1:37:23] right you heard from your theophany you
[1:37:25] heard something that you you recognize
[1:37:28] you've heard it before we still believe
[1:37:31] those things he's got dust all over his
[1:37:33] clothes and things he brother B said
[1:37:35] he's sitting there rubbing his
[1:37:37] face B talked about how the anointing
[1:37:39] would get to where his face felt like
[1:37:40] leather and he'd rub his face he said
[1:37:42] he's sitting there rubbing his face
[1:37:43] looking around like that but I'm telling
[1:37:44] you I know that voice cuz it ain't an
[1:37:46] uncertain sound cuz I heard it 25 years
[1:37:49] ago and honey we've been trusted all
[1:37:50] this time to believe and there's
[1:37:52] something about that man I don't know
[1:37:53] why but there's something about him I
[1:37:55] believe when I come to this medicine
[1:37:57] church I've got every excuse in the
[1:37:58] world of just being open with you today
[1:38:00] to not believe this message I come
[1:38:03] through a a difficult message situation
[1:38:06] where it seemed like I had every excuse
[1:38:08] to leave and not believe it but when I
[1:38:10] heard the word I heard something I had
[1:38:12] heard before it struck something down in
[1:38:14] my heart I've had many discouragements
[1:38:16] so have you all of us maybe have a
[1:38:18] reason why we wouldn't be here why are
[1:38:20] you here today like Abraham something
[1:38:22] caught your attention beyond the dust
[1:38:25] beyond the humanity you saw
[1:38:33] God I stood at brother brandom's
[1:38:36] grave just a couple months ago and the
[1:38:38] body turned back to dust excuse me for
[1:38:41] being slow this morning but I'm
[1:38:44] just I'm fat I'm not as fat as I was but
[1:38:46] I'm
[1:38:48] fat praise God I mean there's no other
[1:38:51] way to say it I just got to be honest
[1:38:59] I stood there at the
[1:39:01] grave come on church it's dust
[1:39:07] Humanity but the one who used that body
[1:39:09] to reveal the secrets of the hearts
[1:39:11] wasn't in the
[1:39:13] grave the one who opened the Seven Seals
[1:39:16] to US Open the book the whole book was
[1:39:18] open to us we didn't even know what we
[1:39:20] believed till the book was open to us
[1:39:23] and the lamb that opened the book was
[1:39:25] not laying in the
[1:39:28] grave the dust is in the
[1:39:31] grave but not the one who Ed that
[1:39:36] dust church I don't know the Lord may
[1:39:39] come tomorrow he may come a hundred
[1:39:40] years from now but if it's a hundred
[1:39:42] years and we're still waiting these dust
[1:39:44] most of this dust will be gone but the
[1:39:46] the god that used it will still be
[1:39:52] here the brand said friends don't look
[1:39:54] to me I'm your brother don't pay no
[1:39:55] attention to me cuz I'm just Immortal I
[1:39:57] have to die like everybody else and this
[1:39:59] is an interesting statement he said
[1:40:01] don't you listen to me but listen to
[1:40:02] what I've
[1:40:03] said that kind seems almost contrary but
[1:40:05] it's true if you think about it don't
[1:40:07] just listen to me but listen to what
[1:40:09] I've said what I said is the
[1:40:10] message know don't just listen to it
[1:40:12] because it's me listen to the message
[1:40:16] don't pay any attention to the messenger
[1:40:17] watch the message keep your eyes not on
[1:40:19] the messenger but on the message what it
[1:40:23] said that's the thing to look to see he
[1:40:25] said it wasn't the angel his message was
[1:40:27] the mystery that God unfolded it's not a
[1:40:28] man it's God angel was not the son of
[1:40:30] man he was the messenger from the front
[1:40:32] of the son you all know this he said the
[1:40:33] son of man is Christ he's the one that
[1:40:36] you're feeding on you're not feeding on
[1:40:38] a man a man his words will fail but
[1:40:40] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:40:42] word of the son of
[1:40:47] man you see God spoke through him in a
[1:40:51] way like he did to Moses like he did to
[1:40:52] Paul he was indicated numbers 126 hear
[1:40:55] now my words if there be a prophet among
[1:40:56] you how the Lord will make myself known
[1:40:58] to him in a vision speaking to him in a
[1:40:59] dream my servant Moses is not so who is
[1:41:02] faithful and on my house with him will I
[1:41:03] speak mouth to mouth even apparently not
[1:41:05] in dark speeches and the similitude of
[1:41:07] the Lord shall he behold wherefore then
[1:41:09] were not afraid to speak against my
[1:41:10] servant Moses I tell you what people
[1:41:12] today are throwing a whole lot of dirt
[1:41:14] but they ought to be afraid to speak
[1:41:15] against God's
[1:41:19] messenger but again I don't want to
[1:41:21] limit that he had a he had a role to
[1:41:24] play but so do I so do you yes sir and I
[1:41:29] can't play his role I I they didn't
[1:41:32] choose me the director didn't choose me
[1:41:34] to play that actor to be that actor
[1:41:38] right I can't play the part of a of a
[1:41:40] word Prophet one to a generate he was
[1:41:42] one of one right one of one there's no
[1:41:44] there's nobody else that can play that
[1:41:46] role these brothers can't play we
[1:41:47] shouldn't triy to we we can't you can't
[1:41:50] expect us to right we can't play that
[1:41:52] role he he was limited
[1:41:55] edition you know why Beanie Babies are
[1:41:57] worthless
[1:42:00] today it's the way my brain works I'm
[1:42:03] sorry CU they made too many of
[1:42:07] them oh Church there was one prophet in
[1:42:10] this age one Prophet we're not waiting
[1:42:13] on another one he didn't have to have
[1:42:15] kids that were Pro are you with me now
[1:42:17] it didn't do that God it don't come on
[1:42:19] down through the family and we have
[1:42:20] another Prophet no the prophet was the
[1:42:22] prophet we had one in this age and he
[1:42:24] was one of one an extremely limited
[1:42:26] edition but so am I so am I nobody can
[1:42:30] take my place and nobody can take yours
[1:42:33] nobody can take brother Tim's place in
[1:42:34] this message are you with me now brother
[1:42:37] Tim's been a a rock in this message a
[1:42:39] fighter for nobody can take his place I
[1:42:41] don't want to brother Timothy don't want
[1:42:43] to we want to be what God calls us to be
[1:42:46] let's be Elohim revealed in dust
[1:42:56] that's why Prophet told us he said
[1:42:59] before Moses went into the land when the
[1:43:01] eny said other words I've spoken to you
[1:43:02] I'll call Heaven and Earth to witness
[1:43:03] against you if you add one word thing to
[1:43:05] it take one word from it you'll not stay
[1:43:07] in the land I want to stay in the land
[1:43:10] the land is the Holy Ghost I want to
[1:43:12] stay in the land the land of promise the
[1:43:15] land is the open word the open book are
[1:43:17] you with me now where all the blessings
[1:43:20] lay the land of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:23] amen all the blessings lay in the land
[1:43:26] he said so say I in the name of Jesus
[1:43:27] Christ don't you add one thing don't
[1:43:29] take put your own ideas in you just say
[1:43:30] what s on those tapes you just do
[1:43:32] exactly what the Lord God has commanded
[1:43:34] to do don't add to it a lot of people
[1:43:35] say well we'll just listen to the tapes
[1:43:36] then he also said just do exactly what
[1:43:39] the Lord God has commanded to do don't
[1:43:42] add to it he has ever kept his promise
[1:43:44] and he told us to
[1:43:47] preach are you with me now the Bible
[1:43:50] tells us to preach and brother BR Backle
[1:43:52] that cuz he was a word prophet
[1:43:54] ET he said he has ever keep his promise
[1:43:56] to us every promise that he's made he's
[1:43:58] kept it do you believe that today I know
[1:44:00] it's been heavy here for a few minutes
[1:44:01] can you just can you just lift that up
[1:44:03] with me for a moment he's kept his
[1:44:05] promise oh I'm grateful to him today he
[1:44:07] has kept we're here today because he's
[1:44:10] kept his promise I'm here to remind you
[1:44:12] he's still a promise keeper he still
[1:44:15] keeps his promise of healing he still
[1:44:17] keeps his promise of
[1:44:20] Salvation every promise someone say with
[1:44:22] me every promise that he has made he's
[1:44:25] kept it as he told you what would happen
[1:44:27] and didn't happen he said I bring
[1:44:28] heavens and earth before you today and a
[1:44:30] challenge as God ever said anything he's
[1:44:32] not fulfilled and done exactly what he
[1:44:34] said he would do for us hasn't he done
[1:44:35] it just the way he said he would do it
[1:44:37] that's exactly so will he continue to do
[1:44:39] it just don't add to it don't take from
[1:44:42] it just believe it and walk humble
[1:44:43] before the Lord your God for we're
[1:44:45] nearing the going
[1:44:47] in to the land
[1:44:53] I see when Abraham come I I'm not going
[1:44:55] to have time to get to all this today
[1:44:56] but when Abraham
[1:44:58] come he wanted them to feel
[1:45:02] welcome you've heard this many times
[1:45:04] before but just think about it now look
[1:45:05] who he was
[1:45:08] welcoming he wasn't welcoming God in a
[1:45:11] great big bunch of angels coming down
[1:45:14] saying I am
[1:45:16] Jehovah but he made
[1:45:18] welcome the Dust
[1:45:23] let a little water I pray you be fetched
[1:45:25] wash your feet rest yourselves under the
[1:45:27] tree and I'll fetch a morsel of bread
[1:45:29] and comfort your hearts after that you
[1:45:31] shall pass on for therefore are you come
[1:45:34] to your servant look at Abraham's
[1:45:36] attitude I just want to be a service I I
[1:45:38] just want to be a part listen that's my
[1:45:40] desire today and I probably told you
[1:45:42] before I preached it all over the world
[1:45:44] I want to be a servant I want to be I
[1:45:46] want to be like Simon that took Jesus
[1:45:49] cross and and walked that the road with
[1:45:51] him and he was just happen to be there
[1:45:53] there but he was pressed into service
[1:45:54] and when he did he he he just did what
[1:45:56] God told him to do and it changed his
[1:45:58] family history so that even every time
[1:46:01] brother Brandon mentions he mentions a a
[1:46:04] black family or a black person come up
[1:46:05] in the prayer line he said this is one
[1:46:07] of Simon's children and he remembered it
[1:46:09] all those years
[1:46:12] later cuz one man surrendered himself to
[1:46:15] be a
[1:46:18] servant Abraham fixed him a meal he
[1:46:23] didn't just fix any meal he said make
[1:46:25] ready quickly three measures a fine meal
[1:46:26] that's the meal reserved for
[1:46:28] Kings the best of the
[1:46:32] best I talking about tell about that
[1:46:34] earlier we ought to give him our best
[1:46:35] Church give me if that's your best
[1:46:37] that's all right I know you never smile
[1:46:39] but everybody else let's give him our
[1:46:44] best come on
[1:46:47] Church let's give him oh you said it's
[1:46:49] so difficult to smile but I think you
[1:46:51] can you can make it happen
[1:46:54] give him your
[1:46:56] best I know we go through things I know
[1:46:58] we have struggles I know it's real going
[1:47:01] through things right
[1:47:02] now but give him your
[1:47:06] best he didn't call us to be to be hot
[1:47:09] bed plants he didn't call us to just Ju
[1:47:11] Just serve him when the electricity was
[1:47:13] on but he said give him your
[1:47:17] best give it all that you've
[1:47:21] got every raise every ey every go every
[1:47:25] every bit of ounce of strength that I
[1:47:27] got let me give it to you Lord let me
[1:47:29] wash your feet let me give you the meal
[1:47:31] let me give you everything that I
[1:47:35] need I didn't plan in that but come on
[1:47:38] Church give him your best in the
[1:47:40] darkness give him the let him be the
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:48] lightall Abraham ran to the herd and
[1:47:50] fetched an old stringy calf
[1:47:53] cow that was going to McDonald's to make
[1:47:55] a hamburger out
[1:47:56] of that's not what he did is
[1:48:01] it he ran to the herd and got the best
[1:48:05] calf a calf tender and good oh that's
[1:48:09] what I want the meal that I serve him to
[1:48:12] be tender and good I want the preaching
[1:48:15] that I preach and the things that I do
[1:48:16] to be good that's all I got church I
[1:48:19] don't I can't preach like some people
[1:48:20] but I want it to be good for him I want
[1:48:23] him to enjoy
[1:48:28] it man told me years ago his brother
[1:48:30] Daryl Ward I have a lot of respect for
[1:48:32] him he told me one time when I was 17
[1:48:34] years old he said if you you may only be
[1:48:37] a 10-cent preacher I brought me down a
[1:48:42] peg he said but if you only give God a
[1:48:44] nickel you rob God of five
[1:48:48] cents give him your best
[1:48:53] he showed up as a Dusty Hungry
[1:48:55] Traveler and Abraham was hospitable to
[1:48:58] him Abraham knew his character now as
[1:49:00] far as we know this was his first time
[1:49:01] tasting human
[1:49:03] food look what he did it wouldn't be his
[1:49:07] last he the mid time was an opportunity
[1:49:09] for Fellowship he was hungry for
[1:49:12] fellowship and so Abraham stood there
[1:49:14] you remember what he did I don't have
[1:49:15] time to go into all of these little
[1:49:16] things but Abraham stood there with a
[1:49:17] fly bush you remember a fly bush it's a
[1:49:20] something you you sh the flies away with
[1:49:23] right pieces of paper or something you
[1:49:24] flew the you shoe the flies away
[1:49:27] with you know what sometimes deacons I
[1:49:29] see deacons moving around people walking
[1:49:31] around doing things what are they doing
[1:49:33] they hardly ever get anything out of a
[1:49:34] service that's just the truth it's
[1:49:37] difficult to be a deacon it's difficult
[1:49:39] to be a I want to stand up for you for a
[1:49:41] minute what are you doing you're you're
[1:49:42] you got a fly bush in your hand right
[1:49:45] everybody look at Michael he's walking
[1:49:47] around you got a fly bush in your hand
[1:49:50] what are you doing you're keeping the
[1:49:51] Flies off the meal
[1:49:53] you weren't called to preach but just
[1:49:54] stand there listen Church you got a fly
[1:49:56] bush in your hand you got hands you can
[1:49:58] worship him you got a voice you can say
[1:50:00] Amen to the
[1:50:05] word we got something we can do for
[1:50:10] God the almighty God Elohim invited
[1:50:13] himself over for a potluck I like
[1:50:17] that let's go down and see he invented
[1:50:20] that by the way I love it
[1:50:24] it's all right that's personal Doctrine
[1:50:26] it's
[1:50:30] okay oh church I wonder if he wants to
[1:50:34] come to our
[1:50:37] house wonder if he wants to come down to
[1:50:39] this church this morning said I know
[1:50:42] they got something good prepared down at
[1:50:43] evening light Tabernacle today I know
[1:50:46] the the song leaders been praying and
[1:50:48] the preachers been praying and the
[1:50:49] pastors been praying for the people and
[1:50:51] I know the people are ready to hear the
[1:50:52] the word I know there's a meal we're not
[1:50:54] just here to get something we're here to
[1:50:56] feed
[1:51:01] Elohim give him a drink that he desires
[1:51:03] of
[1:51:04] Pentecostal
[1:51:06] Waters I wonder if he wants to come to
[1:51:08] our house he said well he's never
[1:51:10] invited himself over to my house yes he
[1:51:12] has he said behold I stand at the door
[1:51:14] and knock remember he was put outside
[1:51:16] the age but not outside the bride he was
[1:51:19] put outside the age said If any man hear
[1:51:21] my voice and open the door I'll come
[1:51:23] into him and we'll Su with him Su means
[1:51:25] the evening meal It Don't Mean a quick
[1:51:27] lunch break but the evening meal Abraham
[1:51:31] fixed the angel an evening meal in the
[1:51:33] middle of the day there's a significance
[1:51:35] to that he went out of his way to
[1:51:38] provide a meal for him are you tired yet
[1:51:41] I well I just got a little bit
[1:51:43] more I am a
[1:51:50] prit someone said you can do it and
[1:51:55] [Laughter]
[1:52:00] can he sat down with his disciples like
[1:52:02] he did Abraham he said unto them with
[1:52:06] desire have I desired to eat this
[1:52:08] Passover with you before I suffer for I
[1:52:11] say to you I will not anym eat thereof
[1:52:12] until it be fulfilled what was it there
[1:52:14] was a hunger in the heart of Elohim he
[1:52:16] wanted to come down and fellowship what
[1:52:18] was the meal an excuse for Fellowship
[1:52:21] what is this service and excuse for
[1:52:23] fellowship if I can put it that way God
[1:52:25] Elohim wanted to come down and
[1:52:27] fellowship with you and you haven't had
[1:52:28] time to talk to him lately and he said I
[1:52:30] want to meet you in the service I want
[1:52:32] to be there when the meal's prepared and
[1:52:34] I want to talk to you for a minute with
[1:52:37] desire have I Desir to be whole church
[1:52:40] he wanted to be here
[1:52:43] today the same day he rose he made
[1:52:45] himself another body and he ate dinner
[1:52:48] with two of them again the road to
[1:52:50] Emmas and you know the story there how
[1:52:52] he talked to him along the way he looked
[1:52:54] at them sadly started to walk on by oh
[1:52:58] church but he was waiting for them to
[1:53:00] invite him in that's what he's waiting
[1:53:03] tonight for you to invite him
[1:53:05] in they recognize him because they had
[1:53:07] fellowship with him
[1:53:09] before I have fellowship with him I
[1:53:12] fellowship with him in the word and in
[1:53:14] the spirit one day I'll see him face to
[1:53:17] face I long for
[1:53:20] that I don't mind to tell you I'm
[1:53:22] looking looking forward I brother B how
[1:53:24] exactly is that going to be I don't know
[1:53:26] and I don't
[1:53:28] care I just want to be
[1:53:32] there he said blessed are those but
[1:53:34] there who are called to the marriage
[1:53:37] supper of the lamb and he saith unto me
[1:53:40] these are the true sayings of God he
[1:53:42] said I do believe when the bride is
[1:53:44] called out and elected and said in the
[1:53:45] Book of Life there will come a sound
[1:53:46] from heaven will take such a baptism of
[1:53:48] the Holy Spirit into that bride that'll
[1:53:50] take her from the earth and a rapturing
[1:53:51] Grace do you believe that church there
[1:53:54] is a heaven and there's a literal Jesus
[1:53:56] Christ there that will come in a body
[1:53:57] form to receive his church to himself no
[1:54:01] matter how old the story seems it's
[1:54:02] still the truth it's still the truth in
[1:54:05] 2024 again brother Bron said now if I
[1:54:07] never see you again remember the
[1:54:09] marriage supper is at
[1:54:10] hand so after the meal they began to
[1:54:14] talk they said where is Sarah thy wife
[1:54:16] and he said in the tent he called her by
[1:54:19] Sarah her princess name
[1:54:22] he Saidi will certainly Return To Thee
[1:54:24] according to time of life and lo Sarah
[1:54:25] th why I have a son and Sarah heard it
[1:54:27] in the tent door which was behind him
[1:54:29] behind him now God did something in our
[1:54:32] day and I want to just show you what he
[1:54:33] did because it give you confidence
[1:54:35] because you know he's here right I think
[1:54:38] we need to be reminded sometimes what
[1:54:40] we're fighting
[1:54:41] for what we're doing here God did
[1:54:45] something in our day and he continues to
[1:54:47] do
[1:54:47] it but there were many promises
[1:54:50] fulfilled through a messenger and in his
[1:54:52] message and in uh in the the the gifts
[1:54:54] and the signs that God placed in his
[1:54:55] life there were things that were done
[1:54:57] specific there that showed us where
[1:54:59] we're
[1:55:00] at right showed us right where we're at
[1:55:04] so Elohim come down now he borrowed a
[1:55:06] redeemed body I heard someone say and
[1:55:08] it's true it proved Calvary worked CU
[1:55:11] this time he didn't have to blow into a
[1:55:13] body of dust and come down and be with
[1:55:15] us but he borrowed a redeemed body just
[1:55:17] like he wants to borrow your body this
[1:55:20] morning not not to do what brother
[1:55:22] brandham did that that was a specific
[1:55:23] sign again but to manifest the part
[1:55:25] you've been called to do so it's the son
[1:55:28] of man not manifesting himself as a
[1:55:30] preacher or or as one of the nine
[1:55:32] spiritual gifts but as a son of man uh
[1:55:35] as the son of man revealing himself
[1:55:36] through a son of man even thus shall it
[1:55:39] be in the day when the son of man is
[1:55:40] revealed brother brand did that and he
[1:55:42] specifically turned his back to the
[1:55:44] audience to show
[1:55:48] them such a simple thing but was telling
[1:55:52] him something God's doing it
[1:55:55] again and he told him he said each night
[1:55:58] I've been turning my back to the you'll
[1:55:59] find around 1960 brother R starts doing
[1:56:01] this he said I've turned my back to the
[1:56:03] audience that you might know Hallelujah
[1:56:07] as it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[1:56:09] it be in the coming of the son of man
[1:56:11] again just that you might know I'm going
[1:56:12] to turn my back to the audience now
[1:56:14] remember he said when I do this don't
[1:56:15] let me get L saying brother brandham you
[1:56:17] called yourself that angel that's wrong
[1:56:19] I'm a sinner Saved By The Grace Of
[1:56:20] Christ no matter what I did no matter
[1:56:22] how much God anointed me he said if you
[1:56:24] wasn't anointed also it wouldn't work
[1:56:25] it's your faith that does it he said
[1:56:27] this is just a gift just to pull a lever
[1:56:29] back far
[1:56:32] enough again whatever's in you is going
[1:56:34] to come out if you can pull the lever
[1:56:36] back far
[1:56:39] enough to let William brandom step off
[1:56:41] the scene so Jesus Christ can work now
[1:56:44] you pull your lever back far enough you
[1:56:46] can get off the scene Jesus Christ can
[1:56:48] work that's how he works through a
[1:56:49] preacher that's how he works through a
[1:56:50] Sunday school teacher that's how he
[1:56:51] works through every one of
[1:56:53] us I'm hurrying now to finish but it's
[1:56:55] important you go back Jehovah Gyra
[1:56:58] number two in 1960 among other places
[1:57:00] brother brandham keeps attempting to
[1:57:02] turn his back to the audience and they
[1:57:04] didn't understand what was going on but
[1:57:06] finally he gets through to him and he
[1:57:08] gets his chance and he turns his
[1:57:11] back and there's someone said there's
[1:57:14] someone standing before
[1:57:16] me sits behind
[1:57:19] me oh my you know it's interesting
[1:57:23] because it's hard to preach with your
[1:57:24] back turned do you know that you get
[1:57:25] nervous I think some of you y'all feel
[1:57:28] the same way I do not like preaching
[1:57:30] with my back to the
[1:57:31] audience CU you can't see what people
[1:57:34] are doing but he
[1:57:38] did right someone is standing before me
[1:57:41] which sits behind me and it's a woman
[1:57:44] and She's suffering with a heart trouble
[1:57:46] and she has allergies that's bothering
[1:57:47] her she's just behind me she's also
[1:57:49] concerned about a loved one her husband
[1:57:51] that's sitting just frommer he's
[1:57:52] paralyzed has a cane he didn't see the
[1:57:56] cane he was turned around said the
[1:57:59] woman's name is Mrs Brumley believe with
[1:58:01] all your heart stand up and accept what
[1:58:02] you prayed for you'll get what you asked
[1:58:04] for he said if that ain't the same God
[1:58:06] it was down there just before Sodom I
[1:58:08] don't know what is this day this
[1:58:11] scripture was
[1:58:16] fulfilled but you know brother bam told
[1:58:18] us we have something more than that do
[1:58:21] you know that and I'm not doing away
[1:58:22] with the vision or visions what I'm just
[1:58:24] saying is there was something more he
[1:58:26] said the word was
[1:58:28] greater right I don't mean you do away
[1:58:31] with anything else but it just means you
[1:58:33] believe
[1:58:35] differently are you with me now you
[1:58:37] still want to be prayed for you still
[1:58:39] want I believe in prayer lines I believe
[1:58:40] in hands laid on you but you believe
[1:58:42] differently you're not a widow you're
[1:58:43] not you're not crying out and it's in
[1:58:45] the story of the unjust judge and the
[1:58:47] Widow it was a widow woman with no
[1:58:48] claims on an inheritance and an unjust
[1:58:50] judge that just gave it to because she
[1:58:52] came for it but he said even if the
[1:58:53] Widow could get what she but but she got
[1:58:56] she got it by crying he said that's
[1:58:58] God's way of getting something but
[1:59:00] that's not what we are we are not a
[1:59:01] widow we cry and when we cry we are a
[1:59:05] bride where is bride
[1:59:08] hallelujah oh
[1:59:10] church we should come in faith the
[1:59:14] prayer line whatever that it is that we
[1:59:15] come through if you come up for prayer
[1:59:17] this morning or whatever whenever that
[1:59:18] it is whenever you come you come
[1:59:20] believing that you got something better
[1:59:22] even better than what was here when
[1:59:24] brother Brandon was
[1:59:27] alive I hope you're hearing me but he
[1:59:29] preached the word to us he said that's
[1:59:32] God speaking in this day through vision
[1:59:33] but this if that Vision was contrary to
[1:59:35] this that would be wrong he said this is
[1:59:37] more than the vision if any Visions
[1:59:39] contrary to the word leave it alone it
[1:59:41] ain't of God God don't contradict his
[1:59:42] own word let me say this if an open
[1:59:44] Vision could show the sign of a messiah
[1:59:47] and prove to an age that the same God
[1:59:48] that was in Sodom was right there why
[1:59:51] would the open book
[1:59:54] do come on Church what would the open
[1:59:56] book do the open book would reveal to us
[1:59:58] who we are so we are not children
[2:00:00] anymore just begging for a scrap of
[2:00:02] bread we are the Bride of Jesus
[2:00:10] Christ brother brand said the third poll
[2:00:12] was the opening of the word he said was
[2:00:13] far greater than the rest of them
[2:00:17] combined body went back to the dust but
[2:00:19] the son of man is still here do you
[2:00:20] believe that today
[2:00:22] we're not waiting on a prophet to rise
[2:00:24] up God's not going to call that body up
[2:00:26] and then speak to us again we don't need
[2:00:30] it what are we waiting
[2:00:32] on one of these
[2:00:37] mornings oh church but while we
[2:00:43] wait
[2:00:45] Hallelujah I don't I don't even know how
[2:00:47] to finish this but see brother brandom
[2:00:50] taught us that there would come a time
[2:00:52] would Express himself in the fullness of
[2:00:53] his godhead deity through his church
[2:00:56] have the preeminence in this church the
[2:00:59] anointed man now the anointed people to
[2:01:01] bring back the anointed bride and
[2:01:04] bridegroom anointed accepting what he
[2:01:07] brother Bram was just a part of that
[2:01:08] anointed bride but you're part of that
[2:01:10] anointed bride do you believe that today
[2:01:12] and he say what do we need to do to be
[2:01:13] anointed preach the anointed word the
[2:01:17] word of the hour preach the word live
[2:01:19] the word believe the word the word said
[2:01:22] they'll lay hands on the sick and they
[2:01:23] shall recover live the word believe the
[2:01:28] word brother B said the bridegroom call
[2:01:31] will come right through this when the
[2:01:32] son of man will come down come in human
[2:01:33] flesh unite the two together the church
[2:01:35] has to be the word he is the word and
[2:01:37] the two unites together to do that it'll
[2:01:39] take the manifestation of the son of man
[2:01:41] the son of man when the word here unites
[2:01:43] with the person and they Two Become One
[2:01:44] what does it do them manifest the son of
[2:01:46] man again not church theologians I said
[2:01:49] no we don't need Church theologians the
[2:01:51] son of man the word and the church
[2:01:52] becomes one whatever the son of man done
[2:01:54] he was the word the church does the same
[2:01:56] thing brother BR said Jesus was God in
[2:01:59] flesh if Jesus is in you tonight how
[2:02:01] many believe Jesus is in
[2:02:04] you well if if I didn't I'd be seeking
[2:02:07] the Holy
[2:02:08] Ghost that's how Jesus gets in us it's
[2:02:11] by the token the power the true baptism
[2:02:14] of the Holy Ghost Jesus in us the
[2:02:17] literal life of Jesus Christ but he said
[2:02:19] if Jesus is in you it's still God do you
[2:02:23] believe that church manifesting himself
[2:02:26] oh I don't I don't even have much much
[2:02:28] strength left to preach but I want you
[2:02:29] to understand that the son of man is
[2:02:31] revealing himself in his church I'm
[2:02:34] reading the words of a prophet the human
[2:02:36] flesh making himself known God down in
[2:02:39] here in his church making himself again
[2:02:41] the word the son of man being revealed
[2:02:43] in the last days as it was in the days
[2:02:45] of Sodom it was not limited to just a
[2:02:47] prophet but the son of man wants to
[2:02:48] reveal himself through you not through
[2:02:50] his gift but through your gift
[2:02:53] gift whatever it is that God's called
[2:02:56] you to do I challenge you to believe
[2:02:58] it that's what a prophet told us he said
[2:03:00] I challenge you to believe that Jesus
[2:03:02] Christ is revealed in the form of the
[2:03:04] son of man in human flesh through the
[2:03:06] bride's body accept his call will you
[2:03:09] accept it today I challenge you to
[2:03:11] believe that she under her Messenger
[2:03:13] will be the final voice to the final AG
[2:03:15] what do we believeing we're believing
[2:03:16] what God Said I challenge you to believe
[2:03:20] and that day you'll know that I'm in the
