give you all that we got but we're happy to be here with you we love you with the love of the Lord and happy to be in the house of the Lord let's turn in our Bibles if we can the Psalms chapter 32 Psalms chapter 2 32 we'll read out of three portions of Scripture coming out of Psalms 32 Psalms 37 and we'll turn over to Jude everybody love the Lord Psalms chapter 32 verse 7 thou art my hiding place and thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt compass' me about with songs of deliverance Sayla Psalms 37 verse 25 Psalms 37 verse 35 I have been young and now I'm old yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed depart from evil and do good and dwell for ever more for the Lord loveth judgment he forsaketh not his Saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off Jude verse 1 last last verse Jude verse 1 Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James to them that are sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied I want to preach this evening on preserved in Christ let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we love you with all of our heart and father as we come into the house of God and sing the songs of Zion fill the Spirit of God move among us our hearts are warmed and encouraged burdens are lifted faith is lifted and dear God we asked Lord as we gathered together may it not be in vain but may we unite our faith together collectively as the body of Jesus Christ flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone come down Lord and live in the hearts of your people we welcome you here we want you to have preeminence in the service father we commit ourselves to you we ask Lord God that you would send the answers to our hearts Lord as we have need in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you can have your seats I cannot express the importance of the message of the hour that God has sent to us in this day and the treasure of the Word of God that God has given to us it is beyond words god help us never to allow it to be common to us never to lose focus of it the importance if we had the wealth of the world if we were the richest people on the face of the planet if we sat upon the throne of the world it could never compare to what we possess as Christians and what God has given us in his word there is no value that we can place to it there is nothing that we can compare to it it is God in letter form and to leave the word is to leave God but to receive the word is to receive God and in every age down through the ages as God revealed himself to each age he always revealed himself as the word can you say men brother Branham said in the church age book he said don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and the word he said for I am giving you the word which is the revelation of myself I am the word but the random said remember that jesus said the words that I speak to you they are spirit and they are life and to have the word is life if we regarded as life how many regard the Word of God is life Peter said Lords only you have the words of eternal life but down through the ages Satan has sought to devalue the word to deflect the word to to discredit the word to destroy the word to pervert the word to corrupt the word to corrupt the effects of the word in our life Satan is against it in every age he has been you look at atheists and agnostics and how they discredit the story of Noah how they discredit the story of Jonah how they just kind of watered-down the Bible laugh at it or market but yet God has preserved his word down through the ages down through all of the skeptics and all of the agnostics down through all the ages yet jesus said heaven and earth shall pass away but my word will never pass away it will for God's trucks will endure this promise will endure he'll endure forever because the word is God can you say Amen brother branham was talking about a family in his church he said Satan had destroyed their home and their living he said they had a trailer everything was burnt to a crisp and he said that the only thing that was left surviving was a couple books by brother Branham brother Osbourne and he said no in a blessed ol Bible he said it was the only thing that survived the fire he said one day I'll take a text that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never fail brother Branham when he was preaching in 1937 he had his maybe it's Wednesday or Sunday service he had his Bible open he had left and brother Branham said almost overnight the 1937 flood come if you remember he said water went right over top of the tabernacle and he said that the pulpit went plumb up to the ceiling and all of the pews went plumb up to the ceiling his Bible was there on the pulpit and he said it was open to a scripture when he said he went right over top of the tabernacle in a boat we now all the waters receded but the random came in to the tabernacle that same Bible was open to the same scripture that he had preached from heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall never fail how many appreciate the word of God it is life to those that regarded his life and Satan's attack is upon the Word of God the word of life the message of life but to them that regarded his life they will live forever because the word is him and they abide in the word forever all through history Satan's attack has been upon the Word of God Diocletian how he hid band bibles and shut down churches down to the ages men have corrupted it in their translations and so forth but they have never been able to stop it down to the ages they banned it men come under a burden to copy it to translate it and to preserve it and notice these men like Tyndale and so forth that protected the Word of God they were fighting for a sealed book they laid down their life's blood for a book that was sealed what a happy people we ought to be tonight to know that we're not standing for a sealed book but were standing for a revealed book that God has sent to his people it is divine it comes from the heart of Almighty God can you say men brother Branham said after 1900 years of criticism trying to destroy the Bible infidels have rised and fallen persecutions of more persecutions upon this Bible than any book in the world but yet it still remains aren't you happy and you think of how many people have sacrificed their life so we could have a Bible in our lap tonight men that have given the supreme price died spent their entire life translating or persecuted or running but the Word of God has been preserved because it's not the words of a man that's the words of God and every time we read this blessed old book it blesses our heart because God reveals something more isn't that amazing you can read a scripture a hundred times but it never loses its value we can come here Wednesday and Sunday Wednesday and Sunday and there's always something else that's released to us out of it how many appreciate the word of God you know brother Brennan told a story about how they had found the Garner's of Joseph the grain Garner's of Joseph and in there they found grain that he had stored up in their time of famine and they took that grain and they put it in the ground and buried it and you know what it came to life brother Branham said they found a sunflower seed in King Tut's tomb and they took it they planted it after a four thousand year old seed or say you know five thousand-year-old seed they planted it in the ground and you know what it came up because there was the germ of life that was preserved in that seat and though many read the Bible persecute the babe there is a term of life in this word that the devil can never stop because it is life God's life is in his words God is his word he loved the Lord that's why it is the Word of God that brings forth every revival every revival in history was based upon the Word of God every awakening that awakened churches awaken nations affected the nations came by the Word of God because life is in the Word of God every revival that ever happened was because men began to regard the word as life received it thus an awakening took place you love the Lord every time that men died in his tracks is when he left the word every time God judge donation is because he left the word and Satan always tries to destroy the word and if he can't destroy the word he destroys the effects of the word the effects of the word in your life jesus said that day by their tradition he said make the Word of God of none effect see there's an effect that comes by the word of God to those that believe it it heals those that believe it it's sane souls that believes that it brings joy to those how Satan would like to discredit it to you to just devalue it to you so your attention is off on something else that really don't matter amen and so Satan will always try and you watch the fanaticism that follows every revival God sends the word a revival breaks and fanaticism will follow it to try to throw off on the truth the devil turns all kinds of false things and so forth brother Branham said now people as brother said this morning pulling splinters he said 19 different nails today organizations are claiming that they have the original nail that went into Jesus hand he said what if it was he said I wouldn't want anything to do with it god never left us relics and tokens he said the Holy Ghost something that cannot be destroyed he sent the Holy Ghost something alive a nail what good would it do me the original cross what good would it do me to know him his life now we're holding nails and relics and holding on to places like city of Jerusalem that ain't got nothing to do with it the thing is condemned it is rotten it is gone he said I went to church and Rome where they rubbed the skulls of the people's heads and so forth bunch of nonsense and superstition God sent the Holy Spirit the life of God to be in you not a nail not a place not a history but a living reality of God's Word made flesh in you in the church God is not trying to preserve history God is trying to preserve his words in us glory God is preserving us for the future home the world if he can't destroy the word then he destroys the vessel in whom the word of truth dwells amen do you love the Lord notice this genesis 3:15 if you're writing it down you don't have to turn there and now I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed in it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel this was a prophecy it was the first one speaking of Christ and the devil must have really aroused and paid real close attention when he heard the word thy seed because he was showing the Messiah was coming that would destroy the devil but it would come through a seed it would come through a genealogy so Satan begins to watch the genealogies it begins to watch the righteous line and so Cain races up and he attacks Abel thinking he will stop the plan and purpose of God by stopping the righteous seed that was coming down and when Cain killed Abel God rose up Seth a type of death burial resurrection God would bring forth of seed no matter what the devil could produce and the devil began to attack the plan of God watch him in the time of Moses he tries to attack and cut off the seed watch him in the time of Joseph and he's always trying to stop God's program and brother branham said he can almost see it before it gets there Satan as always he tried to cut off Moses he tried to kill all the male children he cut off a bow watching because Abel was the chosen tool that God was going to use Moses was the chosen tool Pharaoh was the Chum sorry the Joseph was the tool that God was going to use but brother Branham says this now God had somebody that would serve Him and his purpose will not be defeated nothing will defeat the purpose of God's plan no hydrogen bombs in the world can defeat the resurrection of his church he said all the explaining of way mathematics and intelligence he said to destroy the faith of God's children it'll never do it this faith will live on forever don't you love the Lord remember the days of Noah Noah now and good and Noah's day the world's had become corrupt they began to build cities man's imaginations were continually evil man's hearts were continually set upon evil God said I'll destroy man whom I have created the Bible said but Noah found grace in the eyes sight of God and so when God destroyed the earth there was one man one seed that God would preserve to carry his promise through the judgments though he would destroy all the earth every living creature that had breath would die every mountain washed away then the floods would cover the whole earth God would preserve one man with a vision who would stand by the Word of God see God preserving his own words and everything was destroyed everything was utterly destroyed under the judgments of God dead bodies are floating everywhere it's desolation but yet in an arc here is God's seed they're being carried right through all the judgments when nothing could live God preserved his seeds when nothing on earth could breathe God was preserving his seed hey God sometimes that are being reduced to one but God will preserve a seed upon the face of the earth God preserved his purpose in Noah because God had already made the promise thy seed will bruise the head of the serpent he'd already made that promise he could not back off that promise he had to fulfill it and Appling brother Branham said I'm so happy he said how happy we ought to be today resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there neither things present nor things to come nor sickness nor sorrow nor death nor perils nothing will separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God imagines in his mind what God purposed and it's hard to bring the past there is no devil there is no power there is nothing that can separate us from the eternal plan what God said then we find in the day that all the world would be destroyed God preserved his purpose and Noah he made his own purpose God he will have a church he will protect the people he will protect his domain that death cannot destroy it what an assurance upon the solid rock the resurrection of our Blessed lover nothing will destroy it it has been planted it is seat of God it is the purpose of God to give you the Holy Ghost it is God's purpose to show signs wonders and miracles it is God's purpose and nothing will destroy it he said teacher sir who will rise isms will rise there may be things that look like that it would be destroyed but it will never be destroyed it is God's purpose to see that it prevails it's up to God we can rest assured that God will never let our heritage be destroyed he is purposed to give it to us don't you love the Lord God's gonna have a family God is gonna have a future home God and you have a seat there you have a home there I've gone to prepare you a place he did not build you a place to see you come short but God put your name there knowing you would be there knowing he would preserve you in this dark hour he sent the Holy Ghost to seal you and to hold you it ain't you holy God is God holding you you're not here by coincidence don't let the devil tell you that you're here by the keeping power of God angels of God and camp about them that fear the Lord God has watched over you you've been the very apple of his eye God is watching over his word to protect it you watching it brother Branham said God would bankrupt the heavens before he lets his word go defeated how many believe that I want you to watch your you are Abraham how many Abraham seed is there God made a promise to Abraham and he told him through thy seed all nations of the earth will be blessed so God's purpose was wrapped up in one man in one place in that age God's purpose was all God invested it all in one man and one woman think about it even in their mistakes God preserved his seed remember when Abraham and I love it because Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God but yet the Bible tells he did stagger I mean think of the coward of a man that would not even stand for his wife could you imagine Sarah's face when he looked at him and said she's my sister she by abrahamic shut up woman I could imagine well that's just your sister I think I'll have that girls my wife she looks I mean think about it under pressure you know the Lord so brother branham talks about ambling and he said ambling was a righteous man and so he said he got his hot bath that night put on his jammies his little hat lays down on his bed sticks this great big old feet up on the bed Wiggles his toes feeling happy and free hands behind his head just think about it tomorrow I'm gonna have that man sister what a time that'll be wonderful he goes to sleep having the sweetest of dreams and future home white picket fences just think about it fairest woman in the land and God comes and said you're as good as a dead man you know brother branham said he said Lord his name Blake said Lord you know the integrity of my heart that man could have told me he didn't have to lie he's the one that lied he's the one that backslidden brought her into my kingdom Lord I'm innocent he said that's right but that's my prophet and if he don't pray for you I'll wipe out your whole nation brother Branham said think about it she said do you see what grace does could you imagine Abraham doing a trick like that he said you talk about a coward he said am black that night the Lord appeared to him said you're as good as a dead man you have that man's wife he said Lord you know the integrity of my heart he said you look at the grace to his prophet when he was wrong he said he said I won't hear your prayers you give him his wife back restore her back but the Branham said why was it why was it grace he said because through Sarah she was the bloodline to the Jewish race and out of that blood would come the Messiah and God already made a promise that through her the Messiah would come this was not about Abraham this was not about Sarah this was about a promise that God had made and God would bankrupt heaven before he let Amla touch her that's why brother Branham said amazing grace it's not about you it's not about me it's about God's unconditional promise in this hour you'll have a bride you'll have a church restore her Satan take your hand off of her it's about God's promise he'll bankrupt heaven before he backs off of it God will have a church whose fullness of God dwells in her Sarah's the type of the true church she's a type of when he said restore her no man could touch her because he had already put his purpose in one man everything was invested in one man just think about your position here God in all the world not all churches but one woman and God has invested his entire purpose in one Church in this thing and he said restore her no man could touch her no devil can touch you no counsel treasures can touch her you're under the preserving power of Almighty God he is our shield that's what he told Abraham I am your shield an exceeding great reward a company of angels are surrounding you you can't breathe without my knowing it you can't do anything without my knowing it and even in your mistakes my grace is sufficient Sara was a type of the true church she was a type of the true Pentecostal church and he says don't you touch her take your hands off of her if God protected the natural seed how much more will he protect this seat how much more will God watch over touch not my anointed touch not the oil and the wine did you know brother Branham said Sara when the visitation of the angels she laughed up her sleeve he said he could have struck her dead because of her unbelief but he could not God could not because he already made a promise to Abraham and she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and brother Adam said he cannot kill us though we deserve it though we're guilty of Hell he cannot because we are tied into Christ we are flesh of his flesh and bone of us bone we are preserved in Christ oh yeah God's grace is holding us it ain't nothing about us it's all about God's promise restore her restore her back he loved the Lord see God invested his purpose in Abraham remember Joseph Joseph you know loved of his father hated of his brethren God had sowed his purpose into Joseph and remember how he got in trouble because of what God was showing him he said we were all binding sheaves out in the field and all the eleven sheaves bowed down to my sheaf it made him angry he said but wait wait I've got another dream he said then the Sun and the moon and all the stars bowed down to mine and they hated him because God was working something out Joseph was gifted Josef's God's hand was on Joseph he had a coat of many colors meaning he was the Covenant child God's promise was to Joseph just like the rainbow covenant to Noah God's purpose wasn't Noah God's purpose wasn't Moses God's purpose wasn't Joseph God was showing his purpose was wrapped up in one to save the entire age and so he gets sold off I thought of Joseph much have been a 17 year old boy how homesick he must have been how confused he must have been when he went to Potiphar's house and it just he can see God blessing him in every decision he makes making the way for everything that he does but then everything goes south with Potiphar's wife then he gets put in the lower dungeon sitting in the in the darkest regions of of prison thinking how is that vision ever going to come to pass you know he'll test our faith he'll test our faith do we believe what we say we believe you say I believe this message is of God even in our darkest trials even in our hardest times even when things go wrong and God don't tell us why they're wrong and this isn't just a week and it's over this is years of missing his daddy and being in a foreign land and Egyptians and their culture and their food and everything about it not only that not just Egypt but the very worst part of Egypt a prison cell how confused Joseph must have been but then God starts prosper him in a prison Lord where are you I'd see you in prison but I don't know what you're doing up so confused anyone ever been there but brother branham said the vision had to come to pass or the dream and so now he was he was a slave for many years he's an impossible situation but yet God's purpose his and Joseph Dean of the Lord God is good so then all of a sudden things take a turn Pharaoh has a dream that nobody can interpret and out of nowhere they remember Joseph after two years they remember all there's a man that interprets dreams he comes before Pharaoh he interprets a dream and that he rises to the top over night let me tell you the salvation of Jehovah will come in the blink of an eye it can turn around overnight things can change overnight things can change right now because the salvation of Jehovah calm in the blink of an eye one moment here's a prisoner the next moment every knee is bowing God don't need years God just needs willing hearts believe him that are ready ready to step out on the front line glory they believe God no matter what the circumstance prison cell or no prison cell homesick or no homesick ready to do the will of God no matter what the cost all the 7/7 famine years begin to strike and all of a sudden the prophecy begins to form God's purpose brought Joseph all the way to this point and notice power without character satanic Joseph had some trials to go through Joseph had some schooling to go through before he could make decisions for Egypt we think that our our trials are hurting us there were only betraying us for the power that God wants to invest in his people glory the prophecy begins to take form turn with me to Genesis chapter 45 verse 1 we come to the climax now of the entire story God's story the whole story of Joseph is to bring us to one place and this is where where I want to look at in Genesis chapter 45 verse 1 when Joseph is revealing himself to his brother and watch this now in verse 1 and Joseph could not refrain himself before all of them that stood by and he cried cause every man to go from me it's a type of the rapture and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren and he wept aloud and all the Egyptians in the house of Pharaoh heard it and Joseph said to his brother I am Joseph just my father yet live his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence and Joseph said unto his brother and come near to me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother who you sold into Egypt verse 5 now therefore be not grieved or angry with yourself that you sold me here for God did send me before you to preserve life for these 2 years have to famine been in the land yet there are five more years in which there neither be earring nor harvest watch verse 7 and God sent me before you to preserve a posterity in the earth to save your lives by a great deliverance in other words a posterity is a surviving remnant in other words the seed of Abraham would have been destroyed by that famine but God had to preserve the line of Abraham in order for the Messiah to come and God invested his purpose into one Joseph to save us righteous line that the Messiah could come God took years to do it the seed of Abraham would have been wiped out but God preserved his seed then in the revelation of Jesus Christ we find out that it's more than story of Joseph and his brethren but it was a type of the blinding of the Jews that God might save a Gentile people he was preserving life in the world who God preserving a seed Joseph dies and he says as he's dying his dying breath God will visit you and he dies there rises up a pharaoh who knows not Joe and then the prophecies come to pass as Egypt begins to afflict the children of Israel for 400 years but it was the time that the deliverer was to come and just as the time that Moses was to come you find out that God rose up midwives that fear God and would not kill the children like they were trying to get him to do and God bless those women for preserving Moses or preserving the lives of the children rather and then as the devil was trying to cut off God preserved a seed of Moses as the Bible said chock a bed hid him for three months then the Bible said she couldn't hide him no more and I don't want to go through all the story it's beautiful the way brother Adam describes it but he said Amram had a dream to build an ark and jakka bet makes yaki exactly they go down about three in the morning down to the Nile River and now she's going to push her baby out into a Nile River swarming with crocodiles heads the size of elephants and just munching on babies and munching and now she's gonna put her baby and a now pull of crocodiles this is not a mother this is an act of faith that God had told her put him in an ark shove him out into a crocodile-infested River tails are swishing jaws are stopping but when she commits it to God angels form a line the river they draw their swords and they're escorting the baby right to a predestinated place guru crocodiles open their mouths angels break their teeth then that's a little precious cargo goes over the whirlpools and over around and straps back over the top what is it God is preserving his purpose and Moses as it's gone down the little now river imagine shining angels or escorting this precious thing till it comes right to its pre decimated place where God is going to raise the deliverer right under the nose of Pharaoh God is going to destroy Egypt he's not going to use Scud missiles weapons have mended mass destructions he's going to use his secret weapon mother because it's going to be a godly mother his saying you were born with a purpose God's purpose is wrapped in your child always believe in God always love God he's gonna use your one day brother branham said it was her that developed the character of Moses now Moses has in him what he needs to deliver Israel from the jaws of the most powerful military that the world has ever known so God says turn them loose let my people go and Pharaoh says no I don't think that I'll do it and so God starts dropping plagues all over Egypt but while God's plagues are falling like bombs not one plague touched Israel they were in Goshen and they were preserved and Goshen they were preserved from death they were preserved under the blood they were preserved by God amen God preserved Israel when they left his Egypt he preserved him in the wilderness turn with me to Hosea chapter 12 verse 13 Hosea chapter 12 verse 13 I love the word of God it's a wonderful food for the Soul sheepy food how many love sheepy food Hosea chapter 12 verse 13 by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt and by a prophet he is preserved that was the first Exodus this is the last Exodus and God has preserved us in this day by a prophet of God you know Joshua went into the land of promise fought joints brother Branham said without a scratch when David had become king from the time he was anointed he went through ten years of hellish haggling but the Bible said God preserved David in all of his comings and goings God preserved him everywhere that he went that means to keep from injury to keep from harm and I want to just I've got a little time can I carry on when God used to Elisha to prophesy a famine that it would not rain till he called for it you find that a famine struck the land of Israel and they didn't have Red Cross and humanitarian efforts to help the people in a time of crisis I mean there was really people starving cattle was starving people were dying but during this time that judgment was upon the earth God takes Elijah up to the brook of Sidra he's dropping down sandwiches to him he's drinking out of the brook God had preserved his faithful servant that stood by the word in a time of famine Jezebel was as wretched as they come but Jezebel had a daughter that was worse than her stay with me pay real close attention her name was a kalila and after Lila married to harem the son of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah if you remember a hat was the king of Israel Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah because Israel had split into two sides back in that day and so the daughter of Jezebel married the son of Jehoshaphat and two harem done evil in the sight of the Lord as he murdered his six younger brothers and if you'll remember to harem died of a disease in the bowels and the Bible said he departed without being desired sin he'll take you farther than you want to go so to harem had a son by the name of a hazy eye and a hazy eye rained one year in Johor instead but a hazy I was killed by Jehu who was given anointed of God to cut off the house of Ahab and it was at that time kalila realizes that the throne is vacant and she begins to kill all the royal seed trying to destroy the lineage and she killed her own grandchildren she was a wicked woman and she was trying to cut off the house of David and defiance to God's promise that out of your throne will reign the seed of David forever it was the devil trying to discredit God's Word but God's perp was in the lineage of the David and while a kalila is killing her own infant grandchildren and killing all the royal seed in the land Jehoshaphat takes joash and hides him the Bible said she stole him one of the Kings s sons and hid him in the house of God for six years see down to the ages God always raises up protectors like the midwives and the time to Moses are down to the ages God would always raise up people with a burden to protect the Lord and Joel Ash was hiding in the house of God for six years that's why he was safe because atha lillah didn't go to church and God knew she wouldn't find him there and notice this the place of his safety was the house of the Lord turn with me if you would to Psalms 27 verse 1 this scripture ought to be very familiar to you Psalms 27 verse 1 the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life and whom should I be afraid with the wicked even mine enemies and foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell the hosts Shallon camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I would seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple watch verse 5 for in a time of trouble he will hide me in here pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle he will hide me sometimes God seed it dwindles down very low sometimes it will even be one that God invests his whole purpose in but nothing will ever destroy the purpose of the Living God it was in the seventh year how did the temple came forth King Josh and they revealed that he had been preserved down through those years do you love the Lord God had someone that would serve Him so his purpose would not be defeated fire cannot defeat God's plan he said I'd love to say this is spoiling all the hydrogen bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church all the explaining away all the math nothing will destroy the faith of God's children is it an amazing how the Jews are so hated it's because the devil knows the promise and the purpose wrapped in the Jewish race so that's why we see Hitler do what he did but that spirit of Hitler lived in Haven when Haman wanted to exterminate all the Jews but it was at that time God takes a little orphan girl puts her in the throne for such a time as this to preserve the seat of his realm finally that seed came finally that seed came that seed came that seed of a woman a saviour to the world God made flesh Herod tried to destroy it but he could not destroy the seed they could not stop him they kicked him out of church they they tried to stop it but nothing could stop him they crucified Him they could not stop it they put a seal over the tomb to try to keep him in string but nothing could make him historical he rose from the grave he buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever he rolled away the stone they could not keep him down don't you appreciate the Lord they're doing the same thing today but they'll never be able to stop the resurrection because he yanked the stinger out of death those apostles looked upon him they said that which we have heard from the beginning that which we have heard and seen with her eyes that which we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life because they realized that the word was not a dead ten commandments but a living Oracle they actually was living on the inside of them Peter said why look upon us as our own power who rose this man the way he did those disciples believed the Living Word of God they begin to proclaim the gospel and it calls to religious disturbance and every one of those disciples gave their life and martyr him every one of them they could not stop the purpose of God I read the foxes Book of Martyrs they drug him through the streets they hung him they hung him upside down but they could not even slow down the momentum of the Christian Church they were so angry with Paul beaten and stoned and rejected and shipwrecked they throwed him that down in prison and he writes two thirds of the New Testament you would have thought that they would have slowed him down his eyes hurting the way it was and they did the greatest thing they could ever do slow him down so he could catch his breath and write a note to use telling us that the Lord is coming and he's coming to them that believe in and is coming to them that love is appearing thank you Lord for allowing that man to go in prison so you could tell me about it same thing they did the John you know John I I'm amazed at Peter I like the way he's quick at the trigger you know he asked the Lord a question the Lord said that they're gonna hang you it tells him what death he should die he looks back at John said but what will this man do he said what's that to you if he tarry till i come follow thou me and there went out of saying that John would not die but Jesus never said that John would not die said what is the U of he tarry till i come PO about me but the madam said we got to be real careful that we don't say what we think we need to say what it said and leave it alone but you see that John they thought he was a witch and they boiled them in oil in the whole night and I imagine it felt like a hot tub Oh John been working hard and God just lets him rested the angels of God Fanning him and they said this man has lost his mind banished him to the Isle of Patmos he's sitting out there rocks and lizards and there he writes the book of Revelation and it's sent to an endtime Church the only age it'll ever know what it's talking about he writes a letter to you brother and new he writes a letter to you he writes it to us and to prepare our hearts it's God preserving his seed he preserved John to write a letter to us so we could preserve be preserved in the end time you love the Lord God is good by going too long just a little more brother madam said if you want to make a rapture get the word in your heart he said eat the book because the word of life always brings Satan coming in like a flood all down to the age it's always been that way that the Word of God brings the enemy coming in when God is manifesting his word so when men received the word and the effects of the word they could never be the same and the church went down - the aegis and the martyrs if you ever read foxes Book of Martyrs I have a copy that was ordered from England about this thick and I got about through four hundred and fifty pages I said it's enough I can't go no more but you know you would think they'd run out of ideas of how to torture people and how to create suffering upon people but it is just beyond human comprehension that human beings could stoop so low or go to such extent to do such evil things they tried to beat it out of him starve it out of him freeze it out of a burn it out of them they tried everything but they could never stop the gospel no matter what they did they could never take it away from them God had preserved him the Bible says in Revelations chapter 2 verse 10 the devil shall throw some of you into prison did you ever catch that the devil shall throw some of you into prison it wasn't the devil as we would know as the spirit of the devil it was the Catholic Church throwing them into prison but it was the devil behind that church that was doing it and I noticed this that governors they fed the Saints to Lions there in Rome and they put all kinds of evil things upon them it was the spirit of Jezebel living in the church those martyrs gave their lives warriors priests would hold out a crucifix and they'd pull their limbs apart by beasts and they say all you got to do is kiss the crucifix and we'll turn you loose you can bypass all this suffering if you just say I'm sorry eirick hand but those men wouldn't even better I they died like heroes because the Word of Life was beating in their hearts even women they dip their hair in the tar and light it on fire and women gave their lives I read one account of a man they started stretching in between mules and he recanted and a 17 year girl said miserable wretched give up eternal life for a few moments of pleasure and she went and took his murderer these people were anointed to stand on the Word of God it was God preserving his seat in the face of the worst adversity but those martyrs knew whom they had believed down through 1000 years every every invention imaginable now I want you to think of this brother branham said in the church age book we often think how could we do it and Bram said that same faith that was in the polycarp's is in us today but this is this is the the part that is amazing to me they had already stripped away the truth of Godhead a baptism of heaven purgatory is paying for sins they did not even have a God that resembled the nature of our God by the time the church had done corrupted the Bible but they were dying for the tiny sliver of truth that they had I want you to think of the abundance of Revelation that God has given us I mean God has literally pulled the barn doors off of his coffers and let us look into the wealth of eternity this message is literally God opening up his treasure chest and showing you the very unsearchable riches of Christ how many say Lord helped me to have cherish this message and it was amazing because the hell over as time progressed the Bible says it actually became Satan's seat and he said these Warriors were like David's mighty men going right into Satan's and overcoming the devil right in his throne room faith of our fathers living still then pretty soon the Bible said she Stoops down into the very depths of Satan where they had taken away everything stripped him of everything that people had nothing and Christianity was almost completely exterminated bear with me just for a little bit and brother and him said that True Vine struggled to survive but God was with that little faithful flock in spite of what Rome might do to their bodies Rome could not kill the spirit that was within them and the light of the truth shown on backed by Holy Ghost and power those that believed the word were killed and the great was staggering drunk tottering drunk with the blood of the martyrs burned churches destroyed churches the word was kept from the believers and in the darkest hour a thousand years of it remember King Tut's tomb that life was still there after 4,000 years remember Joseph this ancient seed God preserved the life and if they buried it and it come to life you never would have thought that the church could ever live again after a thousand years of church and state United them eradicating Bibles preaching and Latin killing anything that would even peak the Word of God but there was a life that was in the seed when God planted that church there was a life going down to those dark ages and at after a thousand years when you would say she can come back when the devil thought that he had the trick squashed all the sudden there came forth a revelation by Luther the just God the life that was in his words and he began to proclaim the just shall live by faith and the justification was born and all the sudden the church rose out of a thousand years of dark ages he nailed the 97 theses on the door of Wittenberg said here I stand god help me the word has life almost overnight God rose up warriors around Luther to fight for the message and to pull them out of those dark ages aren't you glad that God was preserving his seed that was Jezebel the Catholic Church but alpha Lila was the daughter which represented the Protestant denominations that would be born after her and atha Lila rose up after Luther to squash the Lutheran revival then there rose up ten dailies one of my favorite he could speak seven different languages very fluently and he translated the Bible into English he smuggled the Bibles into England until eventually he was arrested there was one time that his burden was to get the Bible into the hands of the common people at one time he was in an argument against this blossom Esclarmonde who told Tyndale we had better been with without god's law than the pope's law and Tyndale responded and said hard to fire the Pope and all his laws and if God spares my life there's many years I'll cause the boy that drives the plow to know more scriptures than you do and he did so Tyndale was arrested and 19 I'm sorry 1536 convicted of heresy executed by strangulation and his body was to be burned at the stake and as he was dying he cries out God opened the king of England's eyes within two years his prayer was answered and they brought forth the Cloverdale addition it was mostly I'm sorry the great Bible where Tyndale's work who was mostly used I think 90% of Tyndale's work was used but he gave his life for it God was preserving this Bible to get into English you know we know by God's grace we know who the messenger the Philadelphian age is as william i'm sorry that was some Charles and John Wesley and there they had a parsonage and that parsonage was burning and John was trapped in the upper storey of it and the roof was about ready to collapse and his mother saw John he was under six years old up in the upper storey and the place is going to burn and so two men get on each other's shoulders and they grab John and yank him from the building just as the building collapses from that time he called himself a brand plucked from the fire see God had all of his purpose wrapped up in John don't you think because that car didn't hit you that that that was a coincidence God is preserving you for this hour don't you think because God healed you of that sickness it was a coincidence God has preserved you for this moment just seconds away from death and it was John and Charles that that turned the world upside down amen I'm bringing this down to a close watching the time a few more minutes thank you we're living in the most deceptive age of all the ages and 1909 in the hills of Kentucky a cabin out there insignificant mountain people it's a little woman named Ella Branham she has a little infant she's three or six months pregnant with her next child Charles needs money so he goes to a lumber camp and he's out when a terrible blizzard comes in and they're left alone Ella an infant baby koala three or six months pregnant with the next child and it was a terrible blizzard Charles's nowhere around and so as food begins to dwindle fuel for the fire begins to dwindle she uses everything she can to burn they're running out of food she grabs her baby and wraps up in bed and it's just trying to preserve the child's life after the winter storm blows over there's a neighbor man up on the hill and he's working and he looks out and he notices there's no smoke coming up off of the chimney he says that's strange I saw smoke before the blizzard and as he begins to meditate on it he said now they couldn't have got out during the blizzard someone might be in trouble and so when he got down to the cabin he realizes there's no prints someone is in trouble he knocks on the door no answer and he forces himself in and there was a little mother and a baby starving to death weakened and freezing to death and the man goes and he gets groceries brings it in he gets a doctor he gets fuel for the fire and it saves their life that baby could have very easily died right there but God preserved his life because there was to be a message that would restore the endtime Church and if you watch as brother branham is growing out they tried a little girl you know says smoke this cigarette bill he said I don't want to she said are you a that challenged him he said I grabbed that cigarette and I went to smoke it he said I wanted to smoke it he said but then he heard and he said I threw it down and took off running he said it wasn't any good of me he said it was God preserving this gift for the end time he said I was out on a boat with my dad and they called me a and they were trying to get me to drink he said I wanted to drink it he said but it wasn't no good of me it was God preserving the gift in my life then the time he was carrying the little girl's books home from school those guys grabbed him and took a rock and beat him until he was unconscious he said let me go home just let me go I'll go home they beat him unconscious he got up and he run home and he grabbed his 22 he went out and waited for him and as they come around the corner he stepped out and said which up you want to die first so you don't have to see the other ones died he said one by one he was a crack shot one by one he tried to kill them boys and none of those went off he said I threw that gun down and wept and laughed at the same time put every bullet in and every one of them shot he would have been a murderer but it was God preserving his seat to bring a message to us restore her back restore that woman back to me God has preserved an endtime bride he has preserved her for a future home the Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit is a preserver of life how many believe that we believe in the power of the Holy Ghost he says in 1st Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 23 and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus isn't it amazing what God has done he has preserved the truth of the Godhead he has preserved the truth of baptism in Jesus Christ's name he has preserved the truth of the original sin he has preserved the truth of holiness he has preserved the truth of the power of the blood and the power of the Holy Spirit he has preserved Paul's gospel Oh Joe Ash was hid for six years in the temple and on the seventh the doors were opened and the trumpet sounded and hear when they thought they were dead God opens a mystery to that age and out comes one where did he come from he come from the temple in the seventh year we've come down through the ages in this last stage when you would have thought denominationalism would have squashed the true gospel all of a sudden out of his pavilion out of his hiding place whom shall I fear the Lord is my life and my salvation now David was speaking of an endtime people as brother Branham preached the rapture out of Psalms 27 was he speaking of joash maybe maybe it's a compound prophecy I don't know but we do know in this seventh age not a king but a queen has been revealed God has preserved a church for the end time God has preserved you for the end time don't you take it for granted your knowledge of the Scriptures is not a coincidence God has preserved it in your heart God has preserved the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost has preserved us how many appreciate the Lord with all their hearts I want to say this in closing all of God's purpose was wrapped up in one man Noah all of God's purpose was wrapped up in Moses all of God's purpose was wrapped up in Joseph all of God's purpose was wrapped up down to the ages one now we've come down through the ages we've went from Genesis all the way to the end do you think God's going to abandon the work now brother branham I don't know maybe I have the quote let me see if I've got it here brother Brenner makes an astounding quote here it is here it is he says I'm bringing us to a close same as they do today the religious system in this big machine that they got set up now will absolutely turn down the promises at the end time with the endtime message the end times signed the end time he said that's supposed to be as God predicted word by word it's on tape if they shoot me down or whatever they might do they'll never stop that message it'll go on the same it's already out it staked it's gone a message approved of God among you by signs and wonders a message that Christ is not dead but he is living the same as he's ever lived he said it's too late it's released it's out brother branham died in a terrible car crash but the word has fallen upon pleasant places the word has fallen apart upon fertile hearts and while the devil has tried everything to throw off the effects of the Lord it's been growing in our hearts it's been growing in his people and God's purpose he's wrapped up look in the mirror God has invested his entire purpose right here worldwide those who have received the message hey man I'm closing how many say Lord let me be faithful where you lead me I will follow whatever you want me to do Lord I'll do it I know we underestimate ourselves because we look at ourselves and we see ourselves and our mistakes Abraham the same way remember Abraham just a while ago she's my sister hey brother when I see you but you know we all have those weaknesses to every one of us we could actually look at one another and pull out weaknesses on one another God ain't looking at that he's looking at his covenant did you ever wonder how Samson got done everything that he did God wasn't looking at Samson God was looking at the Covenant and as long as that covenant was there the power was there it's God's grace upon every one of us let us stand our feet where he [Music] we'll follow where he leads me I will follow me [Music] we're lives [Music] you [Music] take that your friend [Music] yes [Music] [Music] one more time in the spirit [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heavenly Father we just took a walk through the Scriptures we just seen Lord how every age Lord you never failed how you preserve someone upon the face of the earth somebody that would believe somebody that would care somebody Lord that would give all we want to thank you Lord for preserving this message down to the ages and now the mantle is handed to us and God we ask in Jesus name if there be any sick among us tonight God send the power of the Holy Spirit we believe in the old fashioned gospel of Jesus Christ the way Paul preached him we believe Lord that the Bible is your infallible Word we believe Lord that every promises yay an amen we believe that your the unchanging God and you cannot change we believe you're faithful we believe you're true I pray in Jesus name if there be any sick Lord send your Holy Spirit move among us Lord in your power I pray Lord that you heal those that are sick among us there Benny discouraged any weary I pray that the Holy Spirit Lord would lift up the hands that hang down strengthen the feeble knees I pray dear God that you'll send the power of the Holy Spirit baptize our hearts afresh Lord I ask him Jesus name that you bring such a love in our hearts for your word and for this message give us oil tea Lord to stand by it may we not entertain Lord thoughts of unbelief and worry and doubt but may we be strong giving praise to God we love you and we thank you for all that you've done all that you've invested to bring this message to us thank you for preserving us well there's so many out of the barstool tonight or strung out on crack cocaine or Lord heroin overdoses are sassed out of their mind Lord you've
