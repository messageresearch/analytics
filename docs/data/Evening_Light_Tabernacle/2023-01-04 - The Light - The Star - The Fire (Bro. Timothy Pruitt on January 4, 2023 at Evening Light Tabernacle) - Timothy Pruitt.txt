bless each heart that's here Lord that may be listen on stream father that you your presence to just surround them during these moments and these times where you ask if your glory we love you now and thank you in Jesus name amen hey man let's turn to Exodus 13 if you would and also Matthew 2 . man Exodus 13 and verse 21 it says the Lord and the Lord went before them by day in the pillar of cloud to lead them in the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night and he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people also Matthew Chapter 2 and verse 1 it says when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship Him and when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled in all Jerusalem with them and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded them where Christ should be born they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel and Herod when he had privately called the wise men inquired to them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found him bring him what bring me word again that I may come and worship him also but when they had heard the king they departed in low the star which they saw in the East went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy amen we let you be seated amen I want to speak to you tonight on the light the star the fire amen the light the star of the fire a mysterious light has been in every Exodus uh it's been called the pillar of fire it's been called a star but has been has been present every Exodus and it came for a reason it didn't come to just be seen and all and actually not everyone would see it but it came to be present to deliver it came to lead it came to call out it came to heal it came to protect it came to bring God's people to their predetermined place amen and I I believe I'm thankful that we are people that have saw his light amen the fire of God you know brother Brandon I just hit this quote and it kind of uh stirred me to think about this because he said we we see that they were LED talking about the wise men by a mysterious light that they call a star that they call a star as they was led this thought come to me that the children of Israel were also led by a mystery mysterious light in Exodus 13 we read it that that there was a pillar of fire that went before them to lead them to the promise that God had given them amen to more to make sure they made it to their destination amen listen God is not just here to tell us you got to go here but he's here to lead us to the place he has determined for us amen you know we could there was others he said Joseph stood there as he and Mary would make their way to Bethlehem and he would stand there looking down across that Valley as they would make that last Camp before they would go into Bethlehem he saw a strange sight it's unusual right in this it's usually right in the time of trouble when Supernatural things happen I love that amen's right in the time of trouble when Supernatural things happen he looked over and he saw a star he had never remembered ever seeing one so big it looked so low it was hanging right over Bethlehem he looked up and he turned and after he helped Mary up on the Rock the rest a little while and he turned us around to say to her dear did you ever notice and when he turned he seen the reflection of that star and her pretty black eyes as she sat there smiling saying dear isn't that a strange thing she said Joseph honey I've watched that since the sun went down I've been watching that star and I feel really strange tonight that something is about to happen it's usually that way you know when you have that strange feeling she had been watching that star in Joseph and the little mule taking his rest breathing and they watched that star and it had an odd action to it it didn't act like the rest of the Stars it didn't look like the rest of the Stars it seemed to be rest Restless moving around it was waiting for some something watching for something to happen amen the light of God looking over his word to make sure it comes to pass amen and I'm thinking you know not everybody saw that star they meant as as we read the wise men went into Jerusalem and they began to ask where is he the king of the Jews you know uh but they had been watching it for some time and seeing this supernatural phenomena amen but not everyone saw that not even those that were close around not even those all that maybe that were in Bethlehem saw that star or otherwise they would have come and they would have been there but amen it was actually amen the the light of God that was shining out and beaming out and calling Hearts to come worship to call in Hearts to come see amen the manifested word of the hour and that is exactly what has happened in our day the pillar of fire that has come down in this generation it called your heart there was something about it it's moving and it's and the way it acted and the way done amen it got your attention that there's something that was special that was happening amen it was something that was special that was going on brother Brandon would even talk about it the star or the light in our day he said I I looked as he was baptized and he said look coming right out of Heaven out of the place about as big as this platform with the Blue Skies begin to churn like Waters and coming right down came a big thing it looked just like a star whirling around whoa come right down visibly before the eyes move right down like a star at a distance when it got close it looked like a Milling fire of light and I thought my ain't that amazing then he goes on he talks about the light and would come into the bedroom or to the room where he was and and and and and the angel of God would step out of it and he said you know I've often wondered if that wasn't the angel or the light that would trouble The Waters at Bethesda amen I I know a lot of you all has uh got into the Chosen and they they do a lot of good things but one thing that they do not believe that the waters were ever troubled they believe it's a Mystic thing or uh uh just a hoorah or whatever they don't believe it was anything Supernatural but I happen to believe that it was because I know God moves and he moves Waters and he stirs thing amen I just want to ask them how in the world if it wasn't somebody getting healed if it wasn't somebody getting delivered it wasn't Miracles or happened why would a man be lame for 38 years lay there and ask for his chance amen but he had to be seeing something that was going on he had to be seeing somebody get healed somebody get delivered amen somebody get moved Upon A man as they would jump into that place amen but what was it the angel of God would come down and he would begin to move the waters and we know that's exactly what happens in their services amen and that's exactly why we ought to be like those that sat around that pool when we see the water stirred when we see God God began to move when we say Amen you may not see a physical light but you can see the reactions and the things that are taking place amen you can see God coming and moving in his people it's the time to get in it's the time that you move amen it ain't all about God moving you have a time that you move when you see him moving when you see him performing his works when you see him moving on the midst of the waters amen amen you see God moving on the midst of his children it's the time that you move it's the time that you go forward amen amen see you he said see the papers even cared they're talking about the baptism the mysterious uh star appears over Minister while baptism while baptize him and and on down it kept coming he said the night when it's taking place when he called me to the ministry I was sitting in a room bit in prayer my I've been praying all night burden he said I knew something was going on something was happening and I got up and I walked around the room and I prayed again he said I've been a pretty successful Baptist preacher I had audience sometimes thousands I had revivals thousands were saved at a time he said but I was sitting there and all of a sudden I seen a light flicker in the room and it looked to see where I it was at and I thought well here and I was praying and weighing them heels I know that nobody was coming in that car and I thought what is that I looked and he said what was this very same thing that you see in the picture it was spread out on the floor getting larger and larger spreading across and I thought oh God just imagine how you would feel when you saw that he said friends these things are not just something that you can imagine in your mind he said I speak just as direct as he speaks to me just as I'm talking to you now not just imagination I heard something begin to walk I heard something begin to move and I I seen the feet of a man barefooted come walking in through that light coming to my right always coming from my right and he said that's the reason I have the prayer line come that way way it always comes from my right and I looked and I seen his feet and when he got to me he was a tall man he was heavy set weighed about 200 pounds look just as natural as I'm standing here he had his arms folded first time I ever seen him in that form he walked right up to me where I was he had a smooth face dark hair hair down or maybe around his shoulders he didn't have a beard he had smoke a smooth face and he walked up and he looked pathetic to look he was look listen how I described him he said he looked pathetic to look at him he'd look like he was a man if I could just not if I could just picture his characteristics the character of his face he looked like a man that was sympathetic and kind-hearted Hallelujah but yet he looked like a man that if he spoke it would be that way Hallelujah so I looked at him and he looked at me it was I was so scared I was biting my thumbnails until it was almost bleeding and out of his mouth the first words he said was fear not hallelujah amen that's exactly the same words of the Angel amen that led them said fear not amen it was it's the same words that are spoken by the Angels on the heels of the to the Shepherds fear not amen it's the same light it's the same voice it's the same God it's the same miraculous thing that is happening that same one that drawed them out of Egypt amen the same one that drawed the wise men out of out of and brought them to the land of Israel is the same one that is drawing people out of sin and out of denominational system Amen to come to a voice that is sympathetic that cares for you that knows exactly what you're going through and this he has a face and that is kind towards you that is looking at you not with Angry Eyes but with eyes of compassion and when he speaks it's going to be that way Hallelujah he said I knew all along he said I knew at that moment that same voice that was speaking to me was the same one that has spoke to me all along that was the first time I ever seen him like that but I knew that voice he said fear not from sin from the presence of almighty God to tell you that your peculiar birth and peculiar life has always been misunderstood with men your peculiar life and peculiar Birth has been to indicate your take you're to take a gift of Divine Healing to the people of the world I said sir I'm uneducated I could not go he said I'll be with you sounds just like Moses I can't do it I can't talk but I'll be with you I've heard the cries of my people I've heard the amen the taskmaster's whip I've heard all this going on and I am come down to deliver them I want you to understand with the same angel that met Moses in a burning bush is the same angel that met our prophet and so when you look at the results that it happened that day it'll have the same results amen he said the prophet Moses has the prophet Moses was given two signs he said I can't go people won't believe me he said as a prophet Moses was given through signs so will you be given two signs first will be that you'll be able to detect Disease by Your Hand by taking the patient's hand and if you be sincere when you pray get them to believe amen nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer he spoke cancer uh did you hear that cancer the angel of God knows about you amen he spoke cancer that's only disease he said and he said then if you'll be sincere with that it'll come to pass that you'll tell them the secrets of their heart there'll be two signs he said but I will be with you oh my God and it's just then that light began to gather up and as it gathered up it gathered up the up to the angel and got into the angel the angel went in that light the pillar of fire that you see tonight it went out of the room I don't know what to do I didn't know what to do the first patient come to me I touched him with a cancer I don't know what was the matter with them I just let myself alone and begin to pray and Away went to cancer and the woman weighed 150 pounds now perfect health one that was 20 years graduate and Earth with cancer just through and through her but God came on the scene he said that's the way it goes he said when I seen the picture amen and he said I knew it was the same thing that I'd seen since I was a child talking about that picture that we now have other Pillar of Fire he said I knew that was the same thing I had seen since I was a child amen listen this message is not the words of a man of a mere man this message is Vindicated by a pillar of Fire amen that's why we should never get our eyes off of that and realize just how Supernatural this message really is it's not a bunch of Creeds and dolphins or some seventh grade education of a Kentuckian preacher no sir he couldn't come up with all that but this message is coming directly out of the pillar of Fire amen and he talks about that he said I I wouldn't take money off of that because it's too sacred he said they may put up a price so all poor people could get it he said if it was mine it would do whatever it costs to print it that's what it would be but it isn't mine it belongs to them but dear friends what I think it is is God it what I think it is is God to the skeptic and unbeliever that wouldn't believe the signs that you believe he has to believe also and God has sent and given us signs to the world today he always sends signs don't you believe that this will be assigned to you you'll find a child wrapped in swollen cloth is that right the white Wise Men followed a star that brought them to him always God gives signs and wonders he's I think it's a sign to let them know that we're in the last day that even the unbeliever is without excuse now amen and when they told me and brought me it was before the picture and so forth said you'll be you'll die like Mortals Reverend Branham but your picture will live as long as there there is a Christian civilization now opponent the picture doesn't look like me everybody says that's not you well you can imagine that close to you it kind of changes your features too well amen well if it can get close to and change your features what if it gets inside of you amen it'll change what you look at what you look up how you look it'll change all about All About You Amen brother I mean he said Mr Lacy looked at it and said well it's been said by Hypocrites that those lights and around Saints and the Savior was just artists work he said there they were there because it he said they they were there because it can't be doubted no more he said that is not psychology he said that is the uh the optical lens of a camera won't take psychology amen it is something Supernatural striking the lens in the back I just hit this on Gordon Lindsay's testimony actually in the it says the prayer line was forming and one of brother branham's meetings it was actually at Thy Word in 50. Gordon Lindsay gets up and he says while the prayer line is forming he said I want to show you this picture that we happened to get a hold of just now one that brother Brandon was talking about which shows a supernatural light over his head as soon as that picture was taken I made arrangements to have the negative taken to the examiner of question documents Mr George Lacey of Houston Texas and I asked him I said you have all the means of science at your command can you tell me if there's any fake about the particular negative can you tell if there's a superimposure can you tell if there's been a double exposure can you tell if the film has been doctored with in any way he said absolutely I can so he took it this is his words he said it cost us a considerable Psalm because he was a scientist engaged in that work and examined it many examined it many hours in his laboratory and then with his own name unsigned underneath to he declared that the negative was absolutely absolutely positively genuine he said may I just add this word the picture was taken by a hostile photographer one that had spoken against the meeting amen and said he says uh uh it goes It goes on he said fact he said the statement even got in the newspaper and he was surprised as anyone they were Jews Orthodox Jews and so I regard this merely as a varication and Confirmation and brother Branham regards it not that he's Supernatural in any way but a very very verification of his ministry and message of bringing Divine Healing to the people of the world friends I believe the Bible is true and so tonight as brother Branham ministers may we all be in the spirit of God and realize that's a Supernatural is here tonight to deliver people and not only heal them but to heal their souls and to bring men and women to Jesus Christ [Applause] and I want you to understand this Pillar of Fire he did not take it from them this Pillar of Fire has not been taken from you it is still in the Church of the Living God it is still moving Among Us it's it's still Healing The Sick it's still beckoning to the Lost it's still pulsating now the power of almighty God and wise men still will come to it and wise men still will follow it and wise men still would be led by it amen it's not just something that's a historical fact or a historical picture that we can point to 50 years ago that light is still here among us even tonight it's still moving Among Us it's it's still touching Hearts it's still stirring the waters we'll talk about this light for a minute and this fire this star he said I was sitting in the room I was reading my little Scofield bible and I heard something first I saw a light and I thought it was an automobile that turned the corner but it turned as it turned it got brighter and brighter and looked out the door and there was no automobile and I heard something like this and he knocks on the podium four times walking and I looked and the light got greater and just above me hung a great star and the light was kind of more of a green between green and yellow shining on the floor and come walking through this light came a man that looked as I said before could have been a man 200 pounds a huge man he did not have a beard on his face like Christ's pitcher does who he is I do not know he had hair down to his shoulder by shoulder length but he was an olive complexion had dark eyes and he walked as close to me as the microphone is there this is what has been associated with the message that we have received why are you here not because of your own ideas and you thought it was a good thing to get on a camel and and ride 2 000 miles no you're here amen why have you left their family why have you left for land why have you left the things that you have left why are you here because of the light because of the star that is shining out Hey listen there was many other observatories out there there was many other men that were looking and Counting they kept time by the stars but they didn't see that right they didn't see that star but there was men that had been looking and reading and looking and reading and God who's rich in Mercy allowed their eyes to be open to where they could see more than Jupiter and Mars and Venus but they could see the supernatural that began to beckon them and call them to the King of Kings hallelujah amen I'm so thankful that we've been able to see more than just William Branham or more just some good preacher or more than just some church or some idea or some theology but there's people their eyes have been open and they've been pulled to this place by Star by the Morning Star by the fire of almighty God and I'm not even talking about necessarily to this church but to this word he said I it's coming the meetings many times like a big world of fire it's been seen in our meetings here not long ago he said I was baptized in several thousand people standing watching in the month of August down the foot of Spring Street in Jeffersonville and here it come out of the Skies visible around before around 10 000 people moved down where I was standing The Voice screaming from it hundreds fainted on the banks papers carried great articles Mystic star appears over Minister while baptizing one night while speaking in a building I had about 300 000 people sitting out like this up to 2000 up he said I started to pray for a little boy the first one which was a crippled case his little feet was drawed up with like with polio and I was holding a little fell in my arms and was praying and while I was praying the light got real bright in my face and he said I said to myself the custodian must have turned the lights on and you know they they run the show around the place and I thought well that's that's that's strange that a man would do that that's not even being a gentleman let alone a Christian who would turn on a light in somebody's face while praying but I just kept praying and it got brighter and got brighter and everyone very reverent with their hands bowed I raised my head and when I looked up come floating down through the room came the Morning Star Hallelujah you come right up to where I was at and I was told my little baby it was sitting down there to where I was and it sent right down to where I was at and I don't know whether I dropped it or what happened but that baby hit the floor and his little feet like that was crooked come down straight the mother's sitting out front she raised her head up and began to scream and painted and fell on the floor the little boy started to run it off the platform hollering to his mother and there was a Nazarene girl playing the baby grand piano sitting right down Nazarene people are a little or a little emotion have little emotion he said there's any nice Rings here let's see your hands surely there's some Nazarene somewhere well they got enough religion maybe to shout every once in a while you know he said this girl was very attractive young blonde-headed girl said playing the piano but when she saw that she threw her hands up and turned real right and began screaming at the top of their voice for it for she had seen what she had seen and she began to run away from the piano that she was playing the great physician now I was is near he said you heard it and right there as soon as she ran away those Ivory Keys kept playing a great physician now is near the sympathizing Jesus he speaks to the drooping Hearts to cheer no other name but Jesus play not a word or two but played the whole thing and people heard it and began screaming with their handkerchiefs running crying God have mercy on me what was it the light camevisible I believe if there ought to be a people on the face of this Earth that ought to be expecting to see the pillar of fire it ought to be the people of God it ought to be the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah every one of you was born in a crippled condition every one of you was born and shaped in sin and speaking lies and shaped an iniquity you come into this world like that born all crippled up but the Morning Star came floating by Amen to begin to burn brighter and brighter and brighter until things begin to come unclogged in your life to where you can see I'm not a sinner that's not who I am I'm a son or daughter of God it's the fire that is visited this generation you know what happened with them wise men when they recognized what that was he said the wise men got the best things they could get together the best gifts they can offer he said maybe they cast lots maybe it fell on three of those and they load camels but they got the best they got the gold the myrrh and the frequent scents they waited unto the star come out at night and they began to move Westward up over the mountains and he said it wasn't an Easy Pass he said it was a rough path sometimes he leads through pretty rugged terrain foreign but when you have seen him you're going to bring your best uh you know they could have loaded it with apples they could have load it with bananas or raisins they could load it with a lot of things but they brother Brown said they loaded it with the best they had because they had witnessed something that was Supernatural and so therefore they was going to come and give him praise with the best they had they was going to bow down before him with the best they had amen I I think that ought to be a good example for us if we have truly seen the supernatural Among Us and the supernatural movement and the supernatural touching and the supernatural saving and healing we ought to come and bring our best if we're truly going to worship the King of Kings and the Lord of lords it ought to be our best worship it ought to be the best that we can give not our not our last bit of efforts and not our last bit of this but everything that we have it's going to lead through some pretty rugged spots we've been through some rugged spots rough spots hard spots every one of us has but it doesn't matter which way he leads as long as he's leading and we get there that's the main thing as the poet expressed some through the waters some through the floods some through deep trials but it's all through the blood God leads his children amen it's a light that is leading him and only camels they climb the mountains rugged and steep they went through valleys they went through deserts they went through places of drying and barrenness they went through all kinds of things but just keep following the star you will arrive if you keep following the leading of the Holy Ghost the cross of the mountains that must come down you know maybe a little southern route or something they cross through the Tiger's River and got on the plains that star never failed them that's a beautiful part about the gift of God it will not fail because it's God that Pillar of Fire never makes a mistake it doesn't matter what path he choose to take you on it's not a mistake amen the children of Israel thought he made a mistake but no he brought him to the Red Sea for not for their demise but for their enemies demise amen not for their death but for Egypt's destruction amen so he led them in such a way that where news would get back it had to be gone and long enough and move it around long enough and people watching and saying they're entangled they're lost tell Pharaoh let's go get them and bring them back amen what was it they could that the people that were looking at them looking like they're just going aimlessly here and aimlessly there what they failed to see there was a pillar of fire that was leading them that's what Babylon failed to see he failed to see there was a pillar of fire among them night after night it led them week after week month after month they went through valleys they went through planes finally it led them up to right up to Jerusalem the strange thing when it come to Jerusalem which was the Hub the capital of Jewish religion a star went out I mean he's been watching the star and see it go out that don't happen don't think very often Jupiter's still there been there for millions of years or however long amen but what was it it was a supernatural light the star went out he said see why he said why he said because Jerusalem wasn't looking for it they wasn't looking for the star so the star was not present there oh come on we want to be a people that's looking for it because you have to be looking for it for it to be present there amen that God would amen you start pulling and asking and saying God I need you I'm looking for you and God will show himself to you when it got Jerusalem it faded right out he said that's what's the matter today when we come to this social gospel teachings and so forth why can't they believe in Supernatural signs they're not looking for it therefore they say days of Miracles are past why because they don't believe God can still do miracles they're not looking for it why why do they say that we Mark 16 is not an action no more why because they're not looking for a God who can fulfill that word amen they're not looking forward they're not looking for Supernatural signs they're not looking for it the light's going out they just worship God through Creeds but God is a spirit said Jesus and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth Hallelujah so when he got to Jerusalem it faded out did you notice a gift will not stay or brighten itself or make itself known where it's not wanted that's that's the prophet's word he said a gift will not stay or brighten or make itself known where it's not wanted that's why we need to make sure every service we welcome his Spirit Among Us if we want more healings you better welcome him more if you want more deliverances and more salvation we need to make sure amen that we're expecting him to do what he said he would do perhaps you know the major I thought was surely he'll be here this is where the center of the religion is the main church was there the body of the main Believers was there they thought to be the high priest and great men that had Scrolls in Great Schools and so forth and the King there was a king there but the star left them and and they began to cry out and begin the Rouse of the city and say hey where is the king where is he that's born King of the Jews until all Jerusalem was stirred up about it and they begin to wonder what what's why are they making all this noise why are they acting like this why are they doing all this because they had seen his star they had been already in men and communion or or and their thoughts have been watching and looking at the supernatural and so when you get up in a place where there is no Supernatural it ought to make you ask why where is he the King of Kings and the Lord of lords why does he not made welcome why is he not worshiped why is it signs not among us could you imagine up and down the Broadway through the side of the streets they had to take notice these were not just any these are rich men he said maybe I could call them today Christian businessmen they were riding on these camels decked in fine decorations they knowed there was something about the men but one thing that alarmed them was this question where is he that's born King of the Jews for we have seen a star in the east and we have come to worship him he said that's the Hungry Heart of many a millionaire tonight wanting to find the real holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost maybe I don't know if there is millionaires wanting to find it but maybe maybe there's men or women that are hungry want to find where is this Holy Ghost where is the same one that fell on the day of Pentecost where is the same one that has the same actions and the same power and the same size we where is it we have read that he's the same yesterday today and forever where is it we have read he's a great healer where is he we have read that the holy spirit is for you and your children and for them that are far off even as many as the Lord our gods are called where is it in our churches where's the power that sets the Church of Fire not a bunch of coal Creeds and dogmas and you're you sit there and maybe wait for something down the road where is the fire at today where's the same fire that fell then it ought to be in the church today where is it it'll make them he said where is the power that says the Church of fire that makes them turn off the television on Wednesday night and go to church where is the power that makes our ladies dress like women where's the power that sets a soul on fire and he's out on the field testifying to the glory of God he said even today in Pentecostal Realms are becoming ashamed of the testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ he said in the scripture said in the last days they'll be heady high-minded love is a pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but not in the power thereof the days of Miracles has passed they say there's no such thing as the baptism the Holy Ghost today like they had it on the day of Pentecost they say that's just because they come too late to tell me about it I've only I've already got it and I know it's the truth I same Jesus that God raised up from the dead he's my savior he lives in my heart and in every heart of any believer that accepts him he'll change your life and give you no soul salvation and a testimony of his resurrection but Jerusalem didn't have the answer they didn't know well maybe it's coming maybe it's down the road maybe it's a future thing maybe maybe one day we'll get the bride's Revival maybe one day it'll it'll burn again in the hearts of people maybe one day right now it's not that day not right now is not the season of Miracles you lying down but Jerusalem didn't have an answer the church don't have an answer for that when the scripture says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the church today does not have the answer for that the church don't have the answer he's partly say he's partly what he used to be he he still saves but I don't he he he he he don't heal when Jesus said go into all the world how far all the world two-thirds of the earth know all the world how long does it last to Every Creature to whoever creature amen preach the gospel what is the gospel the gospel came not in word only but through Power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost that's the true gospel and these signs shall follow those or accompany those that believe oh that's what we need today brother here tonight if your church don't believe in that you get in your heart tonight and take it right back to the church the world is asking today where is that God where is that one that used to be where is that God of History if the god of History isn't the same God today what good does a god of History do you if he ain't the same today what happened to the great Jehovah the all-powerful and the El shadia the I am not the I was the I am what happened to it there's nothing that's happened to him it's happened to the people they don't have the answer but they couldn't stop these fellas they wanted to find him if you want to find him you'll find him sirs we would see Jesus you want to find him you will find him he will make himself known to you Hallelujah he said if God's ever anchored something in your heart a thirst to find them there's nothing that's going to stop you from finding up finding him up and down the streets where is he we see the star they didn't have the answer they ain't got it today same thing when God sends a sign of the church the church failed to see it same as they did then so they what they so what they made so what to fuss about until they had to call out the Sanhedrin court and then to look back up and see it's in Bethlehem and they still didn't believe it he said listen brother if your church or the church hasn't got the answers to these signs of Wonders the word of God's got the answer if your pastor don't have the answer the God's word has the answer if you're hungering for it God will show you it in the word God always keeps his word as soon as they found out where it was so supposed to take place they left out of there they went amen they had to get rid of this they couldn't get breezed around amongst people they had to they they couldn't be stopped they had to break out of the traditions and as wise men went out of the city Gates and soon as they got out of that gloomy place out of that gloomy place the star appeared again I have to say it but if your church is a gloomy Place get out of it if it's so dark and gloomy and there's no power priests and there's no signs and wonders performed there's no gospel to say the law says heal the sick it's a gloomy place amen if you leave it the star appear back to you find out where he's at when you come out of the world and this Traditions the glory of God will appear to you again it will lead you when you come out of yourself and out of your sins and out of your unbelief and out of your hurts and leave it all behind and raise your heart to God God will appear to you again when they seen that star again the Bible says they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy I see what's wrong with some people they just ain't seen the star I mean think about it we got people today we call Stars and they exceedingly Rejoice about their star when they run a ball down the corridor they run a football down this and they do this and they do that whatever amen they call them Stars that's not the star I'm talking about I'm talking about the Morning Star and people of this world can look at a men that will fail and do all kind of ungodly things and worship them and how to raise and and shout and do all that and they can do that and yet when the Morning Star appears among us we're supposed to sit like a bump on the log and and not rejoice exceedingly Rejoice with great joy now I understand what the problem is people have not saw the star but when you see him amen he said they must have shouted exceedingly great joy for they knew they were following the sign that was going to lead them to the savior he said where Jesus is there's Gospel Light for he is the light where Jesus is there is fire hello somebody where Jesus is there's fire amen let's just think about the emotional Realms about things I don't know about you but I ain't really ever found any Darkness to make me want to shout I have not found a dark place that I see and I start entering into it I'm like whoa I get to go into this dark place no no that's exactly the opposite but I have had a time in my life that light made me Shout because I was in a dark place but all of a sudden I saw a light maybe it was just a light on a house somewhere and I was out in the woods and I had been kind of turned around but all of a sudden I saw something out there that I could follow and go to and know I could find help in my time of need Hallelujah I understand if you've got a lot of Darkness around you they had a lot to be happy about they had a lot to shout about they ain't a lot to dance about but if you have a light of God move it in your midst and change your lives and Healing The Sick and saving the laws there's something to have exceedingly Joy Great Joy about [Applause] he says fire he where Jesus is there is fire and that's another thing fire will do it will bring emotion out of you how many of your sisters ever burnt your hand on a stove or a hot plate or brothers on a barbecue whatever it brought some emotion out of you some maybe just a little ow that hurt some people got more fire oh they're more hey what do you call that I'm looking for the word they're they're able to take pain tolerance fire tolerance some people Fireproof the fire god can move through and it don't do nothing to them amen but those that are looking for it and all of a sudden they see it moving they see things happening and signs and wonders follow and move and it does something to them amen he said night after night we see him coming on the scene saving the first Souls saving the first saving first the last the lost souls giving them the Holy Spirit that's seeking after it come and call him back to backsliders that's the signs to follow and then we see him also raise up sick and The Afflicted making them well he's doing that along now for some time but then at the end time he's promised there would be light there would be the fullness of the power would be coming the prophet said there will be a day which will be neither light or day but in the evening time it shall be light so I said I would say that we are in the end time so in the end time there is the fullness it's not a partial lie it's the full light therefore it exposes all sin exposes all sickness it pushes back all Darkness evening lights are shining the power of God of the resurrected Christ is Fallen Among Us the messiah messiah sign has appeared that he is with us in us and Will Comfort us will help us will bless us will lead us to the one who has scarred and scars in his hand piercing his side he said I believe that same Holy Spirit that's here now will take us up someday to the right hand of God where we'll see him setting there we will live with him forever and be his children and he will be our God that's my heart's desire is to be with him he said the scripture promises Jesus himself and said The Works that I do shall you do also these things was to appear in the Gentile church one word against it will never be forgiven wow but it would be a sign as it was back there the same Sun the same light is here now the star went before the wise men nobody saw it but the wise men oh there's some wise men here tonight amen they went over every Observatory they they kept time but no one saw it but the wise men it was the same Pillar of Fire that was sent to Moses and Moses was sent to the children of Israel all Egypt did not see it but it was sent to bring signs to bring miracles to bring wonders to lead them to guide them amen to be to bring them out but the first thing you know is they got in trouble following this Pillar of Fire foreign here's a here's a good thought for you tonight you probably ain't gonna like it but God loves to bring you into trouble he loves to put trouble down to see what you're going to do about it so he just stopped up the Red Sea and the first thing you know he marched them right on through that place see how God likes to do it he loves to display his power and love he's God he just loves to show you who he is he said the trouble of this day people say oh them days are past no how can God display himself when you're taught such stuff as that but God loves to manifest himself that's why he brings trouble that's why he allows it matter of fact he puts bits in his mouth and he brings it to a certain place and he brings you to a certain place so he can manifest himself to you here come the children of Israel walking in the light Moses going on before them come on this way God is calling we're going out we're going to Paul Hallelujah they will shouting jumping having a good time oh what's that dust coming oh that's just Pharaoh's Army what what what are you going to do there's no graves in Egypt God said what you so scared about didn't you know didn't you didn't you believe what I did down there what you didn't you see all the things I've done to him already what you worried about why are you trying to make me angry he said when you see these things happen and the light has led you to this place that's the way God does don't get scared look to the light don't be frustrated about it well we had one big trial bless God we got over it we won't have no more listen you're on your road to the promised land there's many trials he led them right out of the desert where there was no water he led them to places there was no food he led them into what looked like traps he led them into battles but there's light well let me tell you it's a whole lot better being in a battle with the light than without it because you're going to be in the battle This World battles it is a whole lot better being in the fight with the light have him looking upon the your enemy and causing them to be fearful he said why does God let this happen brother why did God let this happen let him alone that's God doing that let him alone just walk on that's God's business the footsteps of the righteous ordered by the Lord what difference does it make lost all my money brother Bradham well bless God anyhow well the Lord whoa hi why not the storm blow my house away bless God anyhow I'm sick bless God anyhow the Lord give the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and just keep walking on it's all for his glory some through the water some through the flood some through dream deep trial but it's all through the blood that's the way he leads us it's the same light that led them and it's the same light that led the wise men it's the same light that's still leading the church tonight so don't get frustrated if a Red Sea appears in your path don't get frustrated when sickness comes knocking on your door he said my he said thinking about him just leading me makes me want to shout and scream that's the way he leads his dear children he said I'm not a psychologist he said but can you feel that lovely Spirit now bathing over the building he said what if our eyes could come open now and look what's standing on the sides of these walls and up and down these aisles oh it likes Russia oh Elijah's servant look around you there's more for you than there is against you amen what was it he was looking at the syrians he was looking at the issues around him he was looking at the problems he was looking at all the things that looked impossible and the prophet of God said God open this boy's eyes he says more with us than there's a gift says what do you mean open his eyes Lord and he said he opened his eyes and he looked in the hills were filled with Chariots of Fire and angels are fire and he said tonight if our eyes could be opened and we could see that other round you would see Angels stationed all around this place with swords drawn amen pushing back spirits of doubt and spirits of depression spirits of anxiety it's a war with light and darkness God versus Satan and the light will prevail it looks impossible sometimes it looks like there's no way out it looks like it's what about this sixth spell I'm going through what about it if he got you out of one sixth spell can't you get you out of another one if he got you out of one trouble can't you get you out of another trouble bless God if it got me out of sin he'll get me out of the Grave he's God what difference does it make just keep going keep your eyes on him but uh just for the last few moments here amen what is it the Church of the Living God has to have fire in it it has to be present or it's not the Church of the Living God amen but the church has to have fire we have to have fire in our midst you have to have fire in an engine to make it go down the road you have to have fire in them on locomotives to make them build up steam that would cause them to go down the road he said there's many churches that ain't got enough fire to even blow steam out the whistle they ain't got enough fire to even say Amen he ain't got enough fire that can set him free enough to say hallelujah sure ain't got to know fire to dance they don't even have enough fire to believe anymore that days of Miracles are still here God's still Healing The Sick God's still raising the Dead God's still doing everything he said listen civilization came by fire go back and find the tribes that use fire if he said fire made my clothes fire makes life fire Heats for dinner everything comes by fire if you live in modern civilizations you live by fire and if you live in the divine presence of God you're baptized with fire and the Holy Ghost he said if you throw enough fire in that old steam engine it'll get to popping it'll get to Jumping it'll get the bubbling but something's happening he said all of a sudden you release that valve and pull the whistle and down the tracks you'll go let me tell you you put enough wood of the Holy Ghost and enough wood of the word of God enough fire of the Holy Ghost in This engine this word it'll drive down the tracks to Divine Healing it'll drive down the tracks tomorrow Miracles and signs and wonders it'll drive down the tracks of all things are possible he talks about that turtle remember that Turtle he found that had his head all sucked in he's trying to make it go down the road and he tried to put a switch on it he said I'm gonna make him move and he said I I got me a stick tried to beat him try to beat him real good to make him go they can go down the road and uh he said he just just sit there and look at him he said I I got him it's almost fixed him he said I got me some water and I dunked him in that water a few bubbles come up but he stayed the same way he said you can sprinkle them pour them backwards forwards anything he wants to do they'll go down dry and come up wet still a sinner he said you know how I made him move I went and got me a handful of sticks built a little fire and set that old boy on it he moved in brother so if your church ain't moving hey you can beat them all you want to beat them you can baptize them all you want to baptize but what you need to do is get you a few promises and stack them together it's laying one on top of the other and let the Holy Ghost the same fire that Lit the altar Elijah's day he'll come and write that promise again Hallelujah and an explosion to take place and fire began to go out listen we're not here to be spiritual fire extinguisher I say we ought to build the fire as high as we can build it let the whole world know he's the same yesterday today and forever let the whole world know he heals cancer let the whole world know he's still the savior of any Lost Sinner let them know build a fire higher let's don't put it out let's Build It Up for the Holy Ghost Fire unto her brother that's what the church needs today is an old time Holy Ghost Fire Kendall under glory to God that's what we do five will move the church nothing else will Hallelujah amen your psychology is not going to move her it's not going to happen amen your intellectual speeches is not going to move her but what will move this Church of the Living God is fire the same one that moved him out of Egypt same one that moved the wise men the same one that moves you today when this church was inaugurated it was inaugurated by fire so why should we have anything different why should we try to try to build up amen the power of God by our theologies and our psychologies and our thinking and our wants and our desire Let the Fire Fall it was inaugurated that way he said it was inaugurated when Russian Mighty Wind came in Heaven from heaven filled all the house fire fell on each and every one of them brother the building wasn't big enough to hold them why can't we have services like that amen out of the streets they went singing jumping dancing wait a minute sister wait a minute what about the Virgin Mary she was there too oh yes she was acting like she was a drunk woman could you imagine the Virgin Mary could you imagine saying that in the Catholic Church Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or somewhere else the Virgin Mary was under the influence of the Holy Ghost staggering like somebody drunk and if God made the mother of Jesus go up there to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire for she could go to heaven you'll never get there anything shorter than that might as well get the starch out of your collars and come on that's right and then when he was baptized amen when he's baptized and he talks about it at the River Jordan John saw the fire coming down saw the star the light Saul who became Paul what did he see what caused him to go from trying to kill people and put them in jail to be in one of them that'll cause a lot of pastors to keep trying to kill people and put them in jail get the fire amen it'll cause them to walk different it'll cause them to talk different he says the light is coming again in the evening time God's only chosen place of worship once his message come to what's he going to do in this day it shall be light at the evening time to welcome his children back home to the true Promised Land by the same sign of the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness that's God's chosen place of worship Jesus Christ Moses one day he saw something that was on fire and it attracted his attention and he said that's what is needed today is a church on fire to attract some of these Moses around here to attract some of these Sinners it takes fire to make an attraction oh you let a scream go up the street of fire everybody'd jump in the car and try to follow it there's something attractive about a fire what we need tonight is the Holy Ghost and Fire that will attract the believer that sees it Hallelujah one last couple years we musicians can come he said have you noticed how it is today we got enough God about us to come at the platform say well maybe I better come up so this is experience worldwide yeah I better go up and stand well I don't know here I am see home home there's no enthusiasm there's not a go into it or I get into it and he said as an evangelist it just kills me to see God's people in that shape we're supposed to be on fire what's exactly what he said he says in Revelation 3 you're lukewarm because you're lukewarm I'm going to spew you out of my mouth that's what he said and if he said that that's what he's going to do so let's not be that crowd you're here needy let's get it or die right here let's get it or die notice when this great moving power of God comes into the into a Son of God it quickens them the spirit of Life enters into him what then what does it do it sets them in Heavenly places right now not they will be we are now we already resurrected the Dynamics and the mechanics is going to work quickness we're quicking up into the presence of God where his spirit is and now we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus we're a part of it if you're part of the Bride the bride is part of the groom you know so we'll find out that the same thing that she'll do exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day so what what what what what is it she won't be allowed to see it not by no means a lukewar but she will be on fire for God she'll be moving on in the spirit of God how many can say that lord well your spirit leads me I'm going to go Hallelujah I want you to stand to your feet and raise your hands and make that declaration to him Lord I've seen your star and the word leads me I'm going to go I'm going to follow it I don't care what critics say I don't care what naysayers say I don't care what anybody say he can hair let the devil I'm going to follow
