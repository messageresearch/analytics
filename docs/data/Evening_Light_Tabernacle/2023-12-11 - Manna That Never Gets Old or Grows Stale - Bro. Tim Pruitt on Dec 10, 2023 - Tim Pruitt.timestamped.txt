[56:14] today that we'll realize we're in the
[56:17] presence of the
[56:19] allmighty and that he's speaking May the
[56:22] spirit
[56:23] speak through is his servant today and
[56:26] he through the
[56:27] ears we give it to you Lord in Jesus
[56:32] name amen hallu amen God bless you
[56:37] before you're seated let's turn to
[56:38] Revelation chap 2 in verse 17 if you
[56:42] will
[56:44] please and
[56:47] uh Revelation 2 and verse
[56:50] 17 he that hath an ear I pray you have
[56:55] an ear
[56:55] today not everybody has
[56:59] one amen not a hearing ear not an
[57:03] anointed
[57:04] ear but he that hath an ear let him hear
[57:08] what the spirit saith into the churches
[57:12] to him that overcometh will I give to
[57:14] eat of the Hidden mana and will give him
[57:18] a white stone and in the stone a new
[57:21] name written which no man knoweth saving
[57:26] he that receiveth it and then if you'll
[57:29] turn with me to Exodus chapter 16 and
[57:33] verse 14 I'd like to read from there to
[57:36] Exodus
[57:38] 16:14 and when to do that lay was gone
[57:42] up behold upon the face of the
[57:45] Wilderness there lay a small round thing
[57:48] a small as the hor frost on the ground
[57:51] now us southern people don't know really
[57:55] how to compare that cuz we've probably
[57:58] never seen hor Frost but nevertheless it
[58:01] was just a small round thing and when
[58:04] the children of Israel saw it they said
[58:07] one to another it is Mana for they wish
[58:10] not what it was and Moses said unto them
[58:15] this is the bread which the Lord hath
[58:18] given you to eat this is the thing which
[58:22] the Lord hath commanded gather
[58:25] of it every man according to his eating
[58:27] an OM for every man according to the
[58:31] number of your persons take ye every man
[58:34] for them which are in his tents and the
[58:37] children of Israel did so and gathered
[58:40] some more some less and when they did
[58:43] meet it with an OM he that gathered much
[58:47] had nothing over and he that gathered
[58:49] little Had No Lack and they gathered
[58:52] every man according to his eating and
[58:55] Moses said let no man leave it till the
[58:59] morning not withstanding they hearkened
[59:02] not un Moses but some of them left it
[59:05] until morning and it bred worms and
[59:08] stank and Moses was wro with them then
[59:12] down to verse
[59:13] 31 and the house of Israel called the
[59:16] name thereof mana and it was like
[59:20] coriander seed White and the taste of it
[59:23] was like Wafers made with honey and
[59:27] Moses said this is the thing which the
[59:31] Lord command fill an OM of it to be kept
[59:36] for your Generations that they may see
[59:38] the bread wherewith I have fed you in
[59:40] the wilderness and when I brought you
[59:43] forth from the land of Egypt and Moses
[59:45] said unto Aaron take a pot and put
[59:49] an full of Mana therein and lay it up
[59:52] before the Lord to be kept for your
[59:54] Generations as the Lord commanded Moses
[59:57] so Aaron laid it up before the testimony
[1:00:00] to be kept and the children of Israel
[1:00:04] did eat Mana 40 years until they came
[1:00:07] into to a land inhabited they did eat
[1:00:10] Mana until they would come to the
[1:00:12] borders of the land of Canaan God bless
[1:00:15] you you can have your seats if you will
[1:00:19] turn with me also over to Psalms chapter
[1:00:22] 78 I want to read from there as well uh
[1:00:26] we'll read from verse 12 Psalms 78 and
[1:00:30] 12 marvelous things did he in the sight
[1:00:33] of their fathers in the land of Egypt in
[1:00:36] the field of zoan he divided the sea and
[1:00:40] caused them to pass through and he made
[1:00:43] the waters to stand up as an Heap in the
[1:00:46] daytime he led them with a cloud and all
[1:00:49] the night with the light of fire he clav
[1:00:53] the rocks in the Wilderness and gave
[1:00:55] them drink as out of the great depths he
[1:00:59] brought streams also out of the Rock and
[1:01:02] cause Waters to run down like rivers and
[1:01:07] they sin yet more against him by
[1:01:10] provoking the most high in the
[1:01:11] wilderness and they tempted God in their
[1:01:14] heart by asking meat for their lust yay
[1:01:18] they spake against God and they said can
[1:01:21] God furnish a table in the wilderness
[1:01:24] behold he smokee the rock that the
[1:01:27] waters gust out and the streams
[1:01:29] overflowed can he get bread also can he
[1:01:32] provide flesh for his people therefore
[1:01:36] the Lord heard this and was wro so a
[1:01:39] fire was kindled against Jacob and anger
[1:01:42] also came up against Israel because they
[1:01:46] belied not in God nor trusted in his
[1:01:49] salvation though he had commanded the
[1:01:52] clouds from above and open
[1:01:55] the doors of heaven and it rained down
[1:01:58] Mana upon them to eat and had given them
[1:02:02] of the Corn of Heaven man did eat
[1:02:06] Angel's food he sent them meat to the
[1:02:12] full oh my what a wonderful scripture
[1:02:15] reading today and I just want to say
[1:02:18] that our God is just as much with us
[1:02:21] today as he was as he was recount here
[1:02:25] by David in the psalms now if you notice
[1:02:29] in the reading from The Exodus though
[1:02:31] that you know a lot of people had
[1:02:35] gathered the the Mana but they they um
[1:02:41] they had gathered it and tried to keep
[1:02:43] it over to the next day and and that
[1:02:46] Mana some of that Mana grew stale and
[1:02:50] bread worms and
[1:02:51] stank you see he had been and they had
[1:02:55] been instructed to leave none of it
[1:02:57] until the morning but they didn't hear
[1:03:00] What mo Moses said but they left it to
[1:03:03] the morning and it bred worms and stank
[1:03:06] but then we also read that there was a
[1:03:09] place that the Mana never grew old or
[1:03:13] bred worms and stank amen for he said
[1:03:17] take a pot and put a full Mana thereof
[1:03:20] and lay it up before the Lord to be kept
[1:03:23] for your generation
[1:03:25] so here's Mana that will last for
[1:03:29] generations and and then there's Mana
[1:03:32] that will only last for a day now I want
[1:03:36] to speak on today of the place where
[1:03:39] Mana never grows old or grow stale and
[1:03:44] of course that place is behind the veil
[1:03:48] in the holies of holies behind the veil
[1:03:51] is where the Mana in the presence of the
[1:03:53] sh Glory never gets old and it never
[1:03:57] stinks but outside the veil the Mana
[1:04:00] will grow stale and breed
[1:04:02] worms now brother Bram told us uh in the
[1:04:06] message and I want to it seemed like I'm
[1:04:08] just jumping off here somewhere else but
[1:04:10] I'm want to bring us this for you to
[1:04:13] understand in the message leadership he
[1:04:16] said many of you think I got the baptism
[1:04:18] of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven
[1:04:22] that don't mean one thing you're going
[1:04:23] to heaven no sir you can have the
[1:04:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in
[1:04:28] your life and still be lost and go to
[1:04:30] hell the Bible said
[1:04:32] so that's exactly right well you know
[1:04:36] this has caused many to question and
[1:04:38] wonder oh what do we even need the Holy
[1:04:41] Ghost for if it won't keep us from hell
[1:04:45] and we could have it every hour of our
[1:04:46] life and still be lost and go to hell
[1:04:49] well what do we want it for you know
[1:04:52] perhaps you know we we don't even want
[1:04:55] that Mana I tell you you
[1:04:57] do we all do but a person must go Beyond
[1:05:02] the Veil beyond the courts of
[1:05:04] justification and S the veil of
[1:05:07] sanctification and past the mere
[1:05:09] anointings of the
[1:05:12] spirit the the holy spirit that comes
[1:05:15] and goes like it did in the Old
[1:05:17] Testament it would come down upon men
[1:05:19] and then would leave but here in this
[1:05:22] new covenant
[1:05:24] there is a place that you go in God that
[1:05:28] the Holy Spirit never leaves you it
[1:05:31] doesn't come and go it abides with you
[1:05:37] forever now so again we we must go
[1:05:40] beyond the inner Veil or into the inner
[1:05:43] Veil where the spirit of God comes into
[1:05:45] the soul and that is where the Mana
[1:05:49] never grows stale it must be more than
[1:05:53] just an anointing upon your human spirit
[1:05:56] that stirs your emotion but it must come
[1:05:59] upon the soul and change your nature now
[1:06:03] will it be emotional sure it comes with
[1:06:06] feelings it is not emotion amen but it
[1:06:09] can be
[1:06:10] experienced now but of course this
[1:06:13] problem as to why many will go from Camp
[1:06:16] to camp and the experience will will go
[1:06:19] off before next camp and they'll go from
[1:06:22] meeting to meeting and
[1:06:24] and um from revival to Revival as it was
[1:06:28] uh needing all to be Revival again and
[1:06:31] some you know just blame it on Youth
[1:06:33] Camp or others want to blame it on on
[1:06:36] the experience itself and say well it
[1:06:38] was just a motion no it wasn't just emo
[1:06:42] motion amen it was the genuine Holy
[1:06:46] Spirit but to lack of total surrender it
[1:06:50] only got As far as the the realm of the
[1:06:53] humans Spirit but if it ever gets down
[1:06:56] in the soul and Roots out sin nature and
[1:07:00] the person of Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:07:03] comes in to dwell within the soul you
[1:07:06] are sealed to the day of redemption and
[1:07:10] Satan is sealed
[1:07:13] out amen so it's no longer just a
[1:07:16] baptism or an anointing of the spirit
[1:07:19] that you can have every day of your life
[1:07:21] and go to hell but it is an indwelling
[1:07:25] presence of the almighty God the person
[1:07:28] himself Christ coming to live within you
[1:07:31] now brother Bram uh spoke about this the
[1:07:35] this mana and uh for example speak to
[1:07:38] the Rock I'm going to refer to a number
[1:07:40] of them today some I won't I'll just
[1:07:43] paraphrase and won't tell you but but he
[1:07:45] says brother every man or woman that
[1:07:48] comes into this Divine Holy Ghost
[1:07:51] priesthood has a right to get the
[1:07:54] genuine heartful of the original baptism
[1:07:58] of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day
[1:08:01] of Pentecost the same signs the same
[1:08:04] power the same demonstration same
[1:08:07] feeling same action Glory not something
[1:08:10] that looks like it the
[1:08:13] original amen and the Lord said I'm
[1:08:15] going to store up a whole lot of this
[1:08:17] cuz there going to be many generations
[1:08:19] so every time one comes in I'm going to
[1:08:21] give him a great big heart full of it
[1:08:24] I I I'm so glad to know that there's
[1:08:26] Mana been stored up and there is a place
[1:08:30] of an endless supply of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:34] that is not just an anointing on your
[1:08:37] spirit but but abides with in the soul
[1:08:41] now here's the problem with with stal
[1:08:44] Mana you know as as brother Brandon
[1:08:47] would talk about it he said he said
[1:08:49] don't pick up too much of it just what
[1:08:51] you can use today don't just try to go
[1:08:54] to church one day and get enough
[1:08:56] religion to last you until next year
[1:08:59] amen it won't last it's that kept over
[1:09:02] got wiggle tails in it you know well I
[1:09:05] prayed up I come to the altar last
[1:09:07] Sunday I got my religion done now for
[1:09:10] the for the year for the month or you
[1:09:13] know I'm satisfied and you know that's
[1:09:15] what's wrong with a lot of churches in
[1:09:18] other words you had a lot of it wigger
[1:09:21] tails that tries to get in your
[1:09:23] experience of years ago as he says let's
[1:09:26] get up higher and move right on remember
[1:09:30] the Mana never ceased from that day
[1:09:34] until they entered into the promised
[1:09:36] land and the holy ghost that fell on the
[1:09:38] day of Pentecost will never cease
[1:09:41] falling on the church till the
[1:09:43] Millennium comes Jesus comes in power
[1:09:46] the old corn
[1:09:48] again now so note now we must we must go
[1:09:53] Beyond the Veil and we when we receive
[1:09:56] the Holy Ghost we re become a priest un
[1:10:02] God remember this is the anointing for
[1:10:06] priesthood amen the Bible speaks of us
[1:10:09] as a royal priesthood it says he has
[1:10:12] made us under our God Kings and Priests
[1:10:15] we have a right to go Beyond the Veil
[1:10:18] and receive of the original mana mana
[1:10:21] that can never rot Mana that'll never
[1:10:24] get old manner that will never grow
[1:10:26] stale because it's in the presence of
[1:10:29] the Shina glory and and it's the
[1:10:32] experience is renewed every day now in
[1:10:37] power de seasion brother randam says he
[1:10:39] says this this Holy Ghost Mana that
[1:10:42] began to fall on the day of Pentecost
[1:10:44] was to sustain the church and the church
[1:10:47] was to live only by the Holy Spirit
[1:10:49] until the day we enter the Millennium so
[1:10:52] how long does this holy the Holy Ghost
[1:10:53] is going to last us how long will it be
[1:10:56] poured out how many how many more years
[1:10:59] do we have experience until we are
[1:11:02] translated amen the same Holy Ghost
[1:11:05] notice it was for everyone that was a
[1:11:07] priest in the Old Testament everyone in
[1:11:10] the New Testament that becomes a
[1:11:12] Christian born again becomes a priest of
[1:11:16] God we are priests and Kings a priest is

[1:16:50] down Into the Depths it'll not lift you
[1:16:53] up out of your your ways and your
[1:16:57] doldrums and your
[1:16:58] lukewarmness you've got to fight
[1:17:02] lukewarmness the Bible said that we are
[1:17:05] Overcomers and we are going to overcome
[1:17:07] the lukewarmness of this age and so
[1:17:10] offer fruits it must come from your lips
[1:17:12] you just can't sit there and be an
[1:17:15] observer now of course we
[1:17:18] know of course we know brother brandom
[1:17:21] said it over and over again where that
[1:17:23] Jesus is there is noise but we know
[1:17:27] there can be noise and Jesus not present
[1:17:30] that's
[1:17:31] right amen even brother Brown told us we
[1:17:35] get noise confused with the anointing
[1:17:37] noise isn't ain't the anointing he said
[1:17:40] I've seen a lot of noise and not enough
[1:17:42] Faith to cure a toothache you got to
[1:17:44] come solemnly to the
[1:17:47] father amen and some have trained even
[1:17:52] you can be trained in a congregation to
[1:17:55] to give a response running to the
[1:17:57] platform standing shouting screaming to
[1:17:59] the preaching you know just
[1:18:02] noise and some have confused that is the
[1:18:04] evidence of the Holy Ghost and it's
[1:18:08] not amen the evidence of the token is
[1:18:11] not noise but a surrendered life to
[1:18:15] [Music]
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:17] God Amen now in the message all things
[1:18:21] he said oh I went down there there's a
[1:18:23] lot of power brother the whole the whole
[1:18:25] floor was dancing in the spirit and and
[1:18:28] not enough Faith to heal a tooth he you
[1:18:30] call that power that's not power that's
[1:18:31] blessings there's a lot of difference
[1:18:33] between blessings and power God makes
[1:18:36] his blessings on the righteous and
[1:18:38] unrighteous The Sun Shines and we you
[1:18:40] know we got to get back to truth we got
[1:18:42] to come back to what God means but I
[1:18:45] want you not to lose your balance
[1:18:48] here though it is not
[1:18:51] power nor faith it is
[1:18:56] blessings and blessings are still
[1:19:00] needed
[1:19:02] hallu amen amen shouting is
[1:19:06] needed in fact of the matter is shouting
[1:19:09] should be
[1:19:11] encouraged that's right amen
[1:19:14] hallelujah
[1:19:17] W what if it's just noise but but just
[1:19:22] and only blessing well why why God deny
[1:19:24] God's people
[1:19:27] blessings but anyway let's just talk
[1:19:29] about what the Bible said about shouting
[1:19:31] for a minute Psalms 32:11 be glad in the
[1:19:34] Lord and rejoice ye righteous and Shout
[1:19:38] for
[1:19:39] Joy all ye that are upright or righteous
[1:19:42] in
[1:19:44] heart amen so he encourages us to shout
[1:19:48] for Joy Psalms 47 And1 oh clap your
[1:19:51] hands all you people shout unto God with
[1:19:55] a voice of
[1:19:57] Triumph what are you doing you're
[1:19:59] already counting it
[1:20:01] done you know Jesus defeated it at
[1:20:04] Calvary so you've got a right to shout
[1:20:07] with a voice of
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:10] Triumph Psalms 5:11 let those that put
[1:20:13] their trust in thee Rejoice let them
[1:20:16] shout ever shout for Joy because thou
[1:20:19] defended
[1:20:20] them amen let them also that love thy
[1:20:24] name be joyful in
[1:20:26] thee amen but prayer is also the job of
[1:20:31] a priest David prayed may my prayer be
[1:20:35] set before you like
[1:20:37] incense Luke chapter 18 you know Jesus
[1:20:41] tells a parable to the effect that they
[1:20:44] ought to always come and pray and not
[1:20:47] lose heart I you know sometimes this is
[1:20:50] so difficult because of course he uses
[1:20:54] the parable of the unjust judge and the
[1:20:56] woman you know coming to him and but he
[1:20:59] taught us to pray and not give
[1:21:01] up so so again he taught us to pray that
[1:21:06] we Al all to pray not lose heart and
[1:21:08] pray not get become discouraged pray and
[1:21:11] never give
[1:21:13] up you you say well brother Tim we
[1:21:16] prayed for our loved one and and they
[1:21:19] died and we didn't God didn't answer our
[1:21:22] prayer the way we wanted him to so you
[1:21:25] know so you know so so what now we
[1:21:29] prayed and why he told us to pray and
[1:21:32] then we didn't get an answer God wants
[1:21:34] us to God wants us to pray
[1:21:38] anyway even when he says no we continue
[1:21:42] to pray right on for the promises of God
[1:21:47] now if he said no to that no need to
[1:21:49] pray for that anymore but however you
[1:21:51] know the rest of time we can just go
[1:21:53] right back to pray and well what about
[1:21:55] this Lord here's another need I'm not
[1:21:58] giving up just because somebody died of
[1:22:00] cancer don't mean we're not going to
[1:22:02] pray for cancer to leave the people come
[1:22:05] on just because somebody's sick and and
[1:22:08] they died from me we won't pray for that
[1:22:10] disease anymore no we know our God
[1:22:13] [Applause]
[1:22:16] answers but you
[1:22:19] know it seems like the more oia comes in
[1:22:23] the more we want to refine the church
[1:22:25] and her
[1:22:28] behavior until we just want dry theology
[1:22:33] anymore brother brandham told us this in
[1:22:35] the exposition of the seven Church
[1:22:38] ages said Paul saw it coming but he
[1:22:40] warned them about the subtle priesthood
[1:22:42] that would come and take over with its
[1:22:44] false doctrines he knew they would
[1:22:47] Implement a way of worship that excluded
[1:22:49] the people from any part in a Holy
[1:22:52] Spirit Spirit
[1:22:53] Ministry and even today among those who
[1:22:56] claim to be free and full of the spirit
[1:22:59] there is not too much freedom and the
[1:23:01] leoty the best we can see is a you
[1:23:03] preachers with inspired preaching while
[1:23:06] the flock just sits there and tries to
[1:23:09] sorb it this is a far cry from Paul who
[1:23:12] said they when they all came together
[1:23:16] all had the leading of the spirit and
[1:23:18] all participated in spiritual
[1:23:21] worship
[1:23:23] amen so so there again we we have
[1:23:26] worship leaders what are they doing
[1:23:27] trying to Lead You In Worship that's we
[1:23:31] have the ministry of the word going
[1:23:33] forth where God is speaking to the
[1:23:35] people you must respond to
[1:23:37] that amen if you want God to move on
[1:23:40] your behalf had he right didn't just sit
[1:23:43] there and Nod her head but it was her
[1:23:45] response that moved God on her
[1:23:51] behalf she he said that's nothing but
[1:23:53] the
[1:23:54] truth and it was her profession uh there
[1:23:57] a confession that she made in that
[1:24:00] moment they caus God to say give her
[1:24:02] what she
[1:24:03] wants you want God to give you what you
[1:24:06] want you have a
[1:24:08] need amen then respond to the word of
[1:24:12] godall
[1:24:14] now brother bradam talked about this
[1:24:16] over and over all the way through
[1:24:19] 1964 even after the seals would use this
[1:24:23] illustration he talked about how Aaron
[1:24:26] the great priest now remember you are a
[1:24:28] priest look over to your neighbor said
[1:24:30] I'm a
[1:24:31] priest well okay you probably wasn't
[1:24:34] very
[1:24:38] convincing your wife said oh sure right
[1:24:44] well amen I'm a priest that's what I am
[1:24:49] so bear in mind we are we are priests
[1:24:51] being B born of the Holy Spirit we are a
[1:24:54] priest unto God all right now as a
[1:24:57] priest now we're dressed a certain way
[1:25:00] the high priest would be dressed with a
[1:25:02] bell and a pomegranate a bell and a
[1:25:05] pomegranate all around his His Garment
[1:25:08] and it would ring out holy holy holy
[1:25:11] unto the Lord amen so you see that's how
[1:25:17] they knew that they hadn't been slain
[1:25:20] because they could hear the priest
[1:25:22] moving around behind the
[1:25:24] veil because of the
[1:25:27] noise and he said now listen I'm
[1:25:29] starting to quote now the only way he
[1:25:32] knowed he was alive when he was back
[1:25:34] there they could listen and hear the
[1:25:36] Bell hear the noise brother I tell you
[1:25:40] we need some pom granates and bells
[1:25:42] beating beating together like that with
[1:25:44] a Joyful Noise un the Lord is a witness
[1:25:47] that God still lives and Reigns amen
[1:25:50] what kind of witness them witness like
[1:25:51] that climbed up to that Upper Room
[1:25:53] here's a kind of witness same kind of
[1:25:57] the priest now the same kind watch is
[1:25:59] not bells and PM granat we wear around
[1:26:02] our garments but what what kind of noise
[1:26:05] now them Witnesses climbed up in that
[1:26:08] Upper Room there got the baptism of the
[1:26:10] Holy Ghost they made a palm granite and
[1:26:12] the bell get together they staggered
[1:26:14] like a drunk man under the impact of the
[1:26:17] Holy Spirit God still got witnesses of
[1:26:21] the same thing you be by Witnesses of
[1:26:24] this power in Jerusalem Judea Samaria
[1:26:27] Jeffersonville Indiana and Mena
[1:26:31] Louisiana
[1:26:33] hallelujah what a now brother brandham
[1:26:36] calls this a beautiful picture of the
[1:26:38] church today I wonder I wonder if our
[1:26:40] churches are looking like
[1:26:44] that
[1:26:46] walking you know the reason he made them
[1:26:48] Bells the people on the outset didn't
[1:26:51] know whether he's a liive H or not
[1:26:54] unless he was making some noise I'm
[1:26:56] telling
[1:26:57] you our dead church that don't make any
[1:27:00] noise A Something's Happened yes sir
[1:27:03] they haven't entered into that holies of
[1:27:06] holies
[1:27:09] sir get mad at the
[1:27:13] prophet amen he said them dead churches
[1:27:16] that don't make any
[1:27:18] noise they haven't entered into that
[1:27:21] holies of holies
[1:27:23] everything you find God you find
[1:27:26] everywhere you find God you find a lot
[1:27:28] of noise it's exactly right when Jesus
[1:27:30] went into Jerusalem they broke down
[1:27:33] palms and Galilean phants began to to uh
[1:27:37] sing uh hosana to him that cometh in the
[1:27:40] name of the Lord some of those Pharisees
[1:27:43] said oh that makes chills go up my back
[1:27:45] that's sacreligious make them hold their
[1:27:48] peace what Jesus said if they hold their
[1:27:50] peace the rocks will immediately cry out
[1:27:54] something has to take place when Christ
[1:27:57] comes in so again I'm going to read just
[1:28:01] a couple of these for you because way
[1:28:03] too many to bring them all and and and
[1:28:06] it would be redundant but it's over and
[1:28:08] over and over listen this is not just
[1:28:10] one little isolated thing he talks about
[1:28:14] this is something he brings out all
[1:28:15] through his ministry even after the
[1:28:18] seals in fact this is 64 it's strange
[1:28:22] well it's strange wherever he's at
[1:28:24] there's always a lot of noise you know
[1:28:28] noise is a sign of
[1:28:31] Life remember the high priest when he
[1:28:34] dressed and went to the holiest of
[1:28:35] holies on the end of His Garment he had
[1:28:38] a PM granate in a bell and that noise in
[1:28:41] the holiest of holies was only way the
[1:28:43] waiters knew that he was alive or not it
[1:28:46] made a noise and where there ain't no
[1:28:49] noise in my he might be dead well I
[1:28:51] think that's what's a matter with a lot
[1:28:53] of our churches today there's not enough
[1:28:57] noise about it not enough
[1:29:00] enthusiasm not enough something oh where
[1:29:04] Jesus is there's always a noise one time
[1:29:08] he come Jerusalem they were screaming
[1:29:09] hollering hosana to the king they cometh
[1:29:11] in the name of the Lord some of those
[1:29:13] priests standing there why make them
[1:29:15] keep still hold her peace said if they
[1:29:17] hold her peace the rocks will cry out
[1:29:20] something has to move move when he's
[1:29:24] around
[1:29:26] amen again he talks about it there I
[1:29:31] tell you what a church lets off its
[1:29:33] noise and something happens this ass
[1:29:35] sure the world because everywhere this
[1:29:37] should kind of Glory is there is
[1:29:42] noise but you know the thought today is
[1:29:45] but we're grown up we're mature
[1:29:50] Christians we are now
[1:29:53] well we we
[1:29:55] are we're not babies Pentecostal
[1:29:59] babies we're the mature bride
[1:30:02] tree yeah well if that's so and she's
[1:30:06] mature well guess what in her
[1:30:08] restoration she got her Joy
[1:30:11] back so actually lack of joy is a sign
[1:30:15] of
[1:30:18] immaturity
[1:30:20] hello amen you he said the devil ate off
[1:30:24] the joy of
[1:30:26] Salvation you people make too much
[1:30:29] noise Hallelujah so I want you to notice
[1:30:31] here brother Brandon told us what takes
[1:30:34] the joy away like that is the
[1:30:36] devil so what kind of spirit would be
[1:30:39] anointing people today to say that's
[1:30:42] right you're making too much
[1:30:45] noise but I want you to know the brid
[1:30:47] tree has been restored and the joy of
[1:30:50] our Salvation is back
[1:30:53] he has restored to us the joy of our
[1:30:56] salvation and think of this God gives us
[1:30:59] Angels food bread from Heaven that
[1:31:03] tastes so sweet it's just
[1:31:07] Heavenly amen now that man was kept in
[1:31:10] in the ark of testimony within the
[1:31:13] holiest of holies in the presence of the
[1:31:15] sh sh kind of glory and I want you to
[1:31:17] think there are three things that must
[1:31:20] be in your Ark of testimony
[1:31:23] now remember it was called the testimony
[1:31:25] or the Arc of testimony so all of these
[1:31:28] must be in your testimony must be in
[1:31:31] your art you're a
[1:31:33] priest these must not be less missing
[1:31:36] one a supply of Mana the holy ghost that
[1:31:40] never runs
[1:31:41] out you're always filled the Holy Ghost
[1:31:45] remains it doesn't come and go it never
[1:31:48] breeds worms or
[1:31:50] stink
[1:31:52] amen so one number one is a part of Mana
[1:31:57] representing the Holy
[1:31:59] Ghost amen and here you have come in the
[1:32:02] presence of God with the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:05] your Mana never grows old and it never
[1:32:09] breathes worms and it never
[1:32:12] stinks it's still just as good as the
[1:32:15] day you got it it's still just as fresh
[1:32:18] as it always was it's still joy
[1:32:20] unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah
[1:32:24] number two the law of God the
[1:32:28] tablets where God wrote with his finger
[1:32:31] Amen Let me just bring it down to you
[1:32:34] you got it too if you if you're a
[1:32:36] Christian today if you become behind the
[1:32:38] veil if you are in the holiest of holies
[1:32:41] you also have in your
[1:32:43] Ark the
[1:32:45] tablets he writes in your heart his
[1:32:49] law in your nature
[1:32:52] so this must be a part of your testimony
[1:32:55] I have the law of God living in my heart
[1:33:00] a bird flies why because of the law
[1:33:03] within him that's right amen a fish
[1:33:07] swims why because of the law within him
[1:33:11] amen now a Christian now keeps the word
[1:33:14] of God why because the law of God is in
[1:33:18] him amen so you see you must believe
[1:33:22] every bit of it you cannot he cannot
[1:33:24] deny
[1:33:25] himself amen now the third thing is the
[1:33:31] staff brother some of you will know
[1:33:33] exactly where I'm going to Aaron staff
[1:33:37] amen it was kept in the Arc of testimony
[1:33:40] what was it it was when a question had
[1:33:42] come up as to whether he was really
[1:33:46] chosen of God to be a
[1:33:48] priest whether this was God's choice or
[1:33:51] man's Choice cuz they just said hey
[1:33:54] you're Moses brother and Moses chose you
[1:33:56] it's a family deal and we won't in on

[1:34:22] almonds what was that a personal
[1:34:25] testimony a personal experience a
[1:34:28] personal Vindication of God every person

[1:35:16] message you're going to have to have
[1:35:17] your own personal experience where God
[1:35:19] vindicates to you you are
[1:35:23] chosen man didn't choose you this wasn't
[1:35:26] your idea this was
[1:35:29] him you're going to have to have his

[1:37:55] to
[1:37:57] despise The Bread of Heaven they don't
[1:37:59] want it no more it becomes despised
[1:38:02] unwanted in fact they're embarrassed or
[1:38:05] ashamed of it some of the last things
[1:38:08] imparted by this messenger was one that
[1:38:12] they would become ashamed or embarrassed
[1:38:15] of the new birth experience that's right
[1:38:17] they wouldn't want none of them tongu
[1:38:19] speaking acts 238 youngans
[1:38:21] amen they would be
[1:38:23] embarrassed that's message churches
[1:38:25] today cuz it's only moved
[1:38:28] inward amen you think the rejection is
[1:38:30] out there all them Leo Deans rejected
[1:38:33] Christ it has moved right into the
[1:38:35] message and many are rejecting Christ
[1:38:37] today they don't want his
[1:38:41] Spirit Well brother Tim by the year
[1:38:44] judging them by by by the the atmosphere
[1:38:48] and whatever and and they're going
[1:38:49] through a trial it doesn't really matter
[1:38:51] matter your trial has nothing to do with
[1:38:54] where you are in Christ and who you are
[1:38:56] in
[1:38:57] Christ well our church just ain't in the
[1:38:59] atmosphere well it's in the
[1:39:01] responsibility of the ministry to preach
[1:39:04] the word to lift him up into higher
[1:39:07] rounds don't stay where you're
[1:39:10] [Applause]
[1:39:13] at if I was if I had a dead Church I'd
[1:39:17] be doing everything I could to preach
[1:39:19] the word of God to them to tell them
[1:39:21] don't stay
[1:39:22] Dead come on in this sh kind of Glory
[1:39:26] but the Holy Ghost becomes the spies and
[1:39:28] unwanted and they're embarrassed or
[1:39:30] ashamed as I said one of his last
[1:39:32] sermons brother Brandon preached you
[1:39:34] know you you've heard me say this before
[1:39:37] but I read a book on Killing Lincoln and
[1:39:40] it was by um fell by the name
[1:39:43] O'Reilly and and I I I read it and you
[1:39:47] know it was the last two weeks or so of
[1:39:51] Lincoln's life and today Mr Lincoln went
[1:39:54] here and he did this and he did that and
[1:39:56] here he addressed the troops and the man
[1:39:58] who only had so many days to
[1:40:01] live and you know finally comes right
[1:40:03] down the last day and him taking his
[1:40:06] life but you
[1:40:08] know it was a it was a good historical
[1:40:11] account ah I would recommend you read it
[1:40:14] if you want but nevertheless what it did
[1:40:18] for me is I begin to think okay
[1:40:21] what about our
[1:40:23] messenger and what were the last things
[1:40:26] that God was trying to impart listen let
[1:40:28] me stop here just a minute this message
[1:40:32] is not brother Brandon's
[1:40:34] [Applause]
[1:40:37] message it was given to brother brandham
[1:40:39] for
[1:40:42] us but he was not its source he did not
[1:40:45] originate it he didn't write it that's
[1:40:49] to the angel of the church Church of
[1:40:51] leoda write these things so it was to
[1:40:55] the angel addressed to the angel of the
[1:40:57] church the messenger for
[1:41:00] us are you with me so it is not just a
[1:41:05] William Brams or brother Bron's message
[1:41:07] it it is God's message so what were the
[1:41:11] last things God was trying to impart to
[1:41:13] us might ought to go back and listen
[1:41:16] when you think this one who only had
[1:41:19] this many more sermons to preach in
[1:41:21] brandom Tabernacle he had only this many
[1:41:24] more sermons to preach and just just
[1:41:28] last few things God was going to
[1:41:30] impart and one of the last things that
[1:41:32] he would say to the church he warned
[1:41:35] them his own church don't become ashamed
[1:41:38] of
[1:41:40] him so he preaches a message ashamed of
[1:41:45] him what was it God warning
[1:41:48] us and and he would say this in there
[1:41:51] yes you know he warned them that he
[1:41:54] warned them that we will become ashamed
[1:41:55] to say yes I've spoke with tongues yes
[1:41:59] I've seen Vision yes I believe in Divine
[1:42:02] Healing yes I praise the
[1:42:06] Lord
[1:42:08] now but you let a man get a hold of the
[1:42:11] Hidden Mana in the realm of the Soul
[1:42:14] where he never leaves that sh of glory
[1:42:17] and he partakes of that Mana that never
[1:42:19] goes stale or breeds worms and and he
[1:42:22] will he will never be ashamed of this
[1:42:24] Holy Ghost
[1:42:25] Gospel and so as I quote from ashamed of
[1:42:28] him a man who has once come in contact
[1:42:31] with God which is the word and the word
[1:42:33] has been made plain and manifested to
[1:42:35] him there's no shamess about that you're
[1:42:39] not embarrassed it don't embarrass me to
[1:42:42] say I believe every word of God doesn't
[1:42:46] embarrass me when the Lord says to say
[1:42:48] anything and you go say it and do it it
[1:42:50] don't embarrass me to say I've been
[1:42:52] filled with the Holy Ghost it don't
[1:42:54] embarrass me to say I spoke with other
[1:42:56] tongues it don't embarrass me to say
[1:42:58] that our Lord has shown me Vision it
[1:43:01] don't embarrass me to say he's the same
[1:43:03] yesterday today and
[1:43:07] forever so the Mana is to be our
[1:43:11] food it is to be our strength it is to
[1:43:14] be our source of
[1:43:17] Vitality until we reach the Millennium
[1:43:20] amen the Holy Ghost Mana this Holy Ghost
[1:43:24] is a balanced
[1:43:29] diet amen everything you need even
[1:43:32] brother BR said the Rapture is in
[1:43:35] it so go with me to Numbers Chapter 11
[1:43:39] and verse 4 and I want to just read a
[1:43:41] few things here numbers
[1:43:47] 11 and
[1:43:48] four and the mix multitude that was
[1:43:51] among them fell
[1:43:53] austing and the children of Israel also
[1:43:56] wept again and said who will give us
[1:43:58] flesh to eat we remember the fish which
[1:44:03] we did Edens and Egypts freely the
[1:44:07] Cucumbers the melons the leaks the
[1:44:10] onions and the
[1:44:11] garlic and now our soul is dried away
[1:44:15] and there's nothing at all besides this
[1:44:19] Mana before eyes and the Mana was as a
[1:44:23] coriander seed and the color thereof was
[1:44:25] a color of De bellium and and the people
[1:44:28] went about and gathered it and grounded
[1:44:30] in the meals or beat it with mortar
[1:44:32] baked it in pans made cakes of it and
[1:44:34] the taste of it was as a taste of fresh
[1:44:37] oil and when the Dew fell in the camp
[1:44:41] the Mana fell upon it and then Moses
[1:44:44] heard the people weep throughout their
[1:44:46] families and every man in the door of
[1:44:48] his tent and the anger of the Lord was
[1:44:51] kindled greatly Moses also was
[1:44:56] displeased notice a mixed multitude went
[1:45:00] out let's just let's just deal with some
[1:45:02] of this you you see you have Revival and
[1:45:05] phenomenal Miracles are performed and
[1:45:08] signs and wonders and a mixed multitude
[1:45:11] will come along too and impersonate the
[1:45:13] ones is called even in the isua meeting
[1:45:17] you know it wasn't long from the
[1:45:19] outpouring of the spirit and they began
[1:45:21] to speak in other tongues that
[1:45:23] impersonators rose up who manufactured
[1:45:26] their own
[1:45:28] tongues amen you see what it is is the
[1:45:32] unconverted people follow because of the
[1:45:36] supernal and it causes
[1:45:38] trouble people who are sinners now I'm
[1:45:41] quoting this from brother Brandon people
[1:45:43] who are sinners who don't accept the
[1:45:45] Lord Jesus can still enjoy seeing the
[1:45:48] moving of the miracle of God
[1:45:51] Healing The Sick can rejoice in people
[1:45:53] doing right can open their hearts and
[1:45:56] rejoice in a sermon that was preached
[1:45:58] under the anointing and that's the same
[1:46:00] time type of Mana that the Christian is
[1:46:03] eating so notice notice again as he said
[1:46:07] these they can come and enjoy seeing a
[1:46:11] miracle
[1:46:12] enjoy enjoy um you know people rejoicing
[1:46:17] and rejoicing doing right and and can
[1:46:19] even open their hearts and rejoice in a
[1:46:22] sermon that is preached under the
[1:46:25] anointing and yet be a part of a mixed
[1:46:29] multitud
[1:46:31] amen now men and women who come to
[1:46:34] church and profess to be Believers and
[1:46:37] they're not
[1:46:38] Believers now wait a minute we done come
[1:46:40] a long ways yes we found it in the
[1:46:44] Pulpit we found that in the in the
[1:46:47] deacons we found that in church members
[1:46:49] who said I'm a beli believer and
[1:46:50] professed to be a Believers and they
[1:46:52] were never
[1:46:55] Believers
[1:46:56] amen they were just carnal and just as
[1:47:00] soon as a little strain come maybe a
[1:47:03] little question on the
[1:47:04] message maybe you know a little doubting
[1:47:07] here or there next thing they go right
[1:47:10] back to

[1:47:15] they want the fish out the river they
[1:47:16] want the leak the garlic they want
[1:47:18] things that they had down in Egypt
[1:47:20] and the Bible said if you love the world
[1:47:22] or the things of the of the world the
[1:47:25] love of the father is not in you you see
[1:47:28] it never was there let them go through a
[1:47:30] trial and you'll find out what they're
[1:47:32] made out
[1:47:34] of you see no matter how much you try to
[1:47:38] pretend when it comes a strain a man
[1:47:40] will show his best and worst
[1:47:44] Parts but you take a Christian a really
[1:47:47] born again Christian put him under
[1:47:49] strain you watch how he acts you can
[1:47:51] tell what he's made of you see anybody
[1:47:53] can praise the Lord while the holy
[1:47:55] spirit's inv fallen in a Congregation of
[1:47:57] people but let trouble rise and watch
[1:48:00] what takes
[1:48:02] place amen now brother bradam ask are

[1:48:09] the person as the street expression says
[1:48:12] can't take it that's it you can't stand
[1:48:15] up to it brother if you're that way
[1:48:17] backslidings ups and downs ins and out
[1:48:19] why why don't you come to
[1:48:21] Calvary and die yourselves and be born
[1:48:24] again of the spirit of God shame on you

[1:48:47] Jesus Christ amen so so again the these
[1:48:51] are things that that he spoke about and
[1:48:54] he brought out these these and the types
[1:48:57] you know we we remember isn't it strange
[1:49:01] they didn't remember the
[1:49:03] bondage
[1:49:05] yeah they didn't remember their
[1:49:07] daughters being pulled out and you know
[1:49:10] Liv like concubines with some somebody
[1:49:12] else they didn't they didn't remember
[1:49:16] they didn't remember the slave belts and
[1:49:19] and and the humility
[1:49:20] ition and the hard task all they
[1:49:24] remembered was the leaks the garlic the
[1:49:28] good things yes
[1:49:30] sir you
[1:49:33] know that that can happen in a church
[1:49:36] right you know have a little fuss rise
[1:49:38] up in the church you know and it gets
[1:49:41] something started like a cancer and
[1:49:43] it'll it'll kill the whole church and
[1:49:45] then those are the times you know you
[1:49:47] know they don't remember they don't
[1:49:50] remember the blessings that God
[1:49:53] gave they don't remember the deliverance
[1:49:55] from
[1:49:56] sin they don't remember how that once
[1:49:59] they were a drug addict or a dopehead or
[1:50:01] whatever else it's like a man that come
[1:50:03] to me and he was all upset he's all
[1:50:06] upset because that the the church had
[1:50:10] decided to put a parking only for the
[1:50:14] pastor in the parking lot and he was
[1:50:17] upset ready to leave the church
[1:50:24] and of course you know sometimes a
[1:50:25] pastor you know situations comes and
[1:50:29] whatever and he maybe arrives late or
[1:50:31] whatever and I said I I was listening
[1:50:35] this man talked to me about it and I
[1:50:38] said don't you
[1:50:40] remember don't you remember when you
[1:50:42] were a
[1:50:45] drunk don't you remember when you were a
[1:50:48] drunker out there in the the world and
[1:50:51] you came among Believers and and you
[1:50:54] were just happy to be with
[1:50:58] Believers just happy to be with with
[1:51:00] with Holy Ghost filled people and you
[1:51:03] know you you just felt so privileged and
[1:51:05] honored don't you remember when when you
[1:51:08] needed a pastor and you prayed for a
[1:51:10] pastor and you got a pastor and God gave
[1:51:13] you a pastor and now you don't even want
[1:51:15] to give him a parking
[1:51:18] place
[1:51:21] I said what is wrong what's wrong with
[1:51:24] this picture you know you get into these
[1:51:27] places and these things that you don't
[1:51:29] remember what God gave you where he
[1:51:32] brought you
[1:51:33] from the slavery that was down in Egypt
[1:51:36] and what God did to deliver you amen the
[1:51:40] ministry that God brought you in
[1:51:42] nurtured in a time
[1:51:45] of Hallelujah of
[1:51:47] trouble you begin to hate the the Mana
[1:51:50] that's being
[1:51:52] preached you begin to disdain the moving
[1:51:55] of the spirit of God you begin to desire
[1:51:58] the leaks and the garlics of the world
[1:52:01] Amen all of these things can happen you
[1:52:03] know what we need as brother Brandon
[1:52:05] said an old pent oldfashioned
[1:52:07] Pentecostal Backwoods in killing
[1:52:09] Revival amen with the power of God back
[1:52:12] in the church oh they were they were
[1:52:15] just eating Angel's food but they still
[1:52:17] wanted the garlic wanted to go back to
[1:52:19] the old garlic pots it showed they
[1:52:21] wasn't ready to go to
[1:52:24] Canaan amen somebody said to me well
[1:52:27] brother Tim my my daughter went out into
[1:52:30] sin and oh she's done some awful things
[1:52:32] I said well you know look on the bright
[1:52:34] side of it what's a bright side she
[1:52:36] found out she wasn't what she
[1:52:38] claimed that's right now she can start
[1:52:43] over amen as long as she was sitting
[1:52:45] self-righteous in the church and
[1:52:47] everything's all right and I'm going to
[1:52:49] heaven and I got the Holy Ghost and and
[1:52:51] now you found out what you really had
[1:52:53] aren't you glad that the Rapture didn't
[1:52:55] take place back there you wouldn't have
[1:52:57] [Applause]
[1:53:01] wi amen now so you see but they became
[1:53:06] much discouraged along the way numbers
[1:53:09] 30 21 and and five says and the people
[1:53:12] spake against
[1:53:15] God hey you know when you stop speaking
[1:53:18] against the moving of the Spirit when
[1:53:21] you speak against his gifts when you
[1:53:24] speak against Divine Healing altar calls
[1:53:28] prayer lines you're not speaking against
[1:53:30] me you're speaking against God that
[1:53:34] ain't my message this is God's
[1:53:38] message you you know you're you're
[1:53:40] you're not you're not coming against
[1:53:42] evening like Tabernacle no you're coming
[1:53:45] against
[1:53:48] God
[1:53:50] they became and they began to speak
[1:53:52] against God numbers 21
[1:53:55] and5 and against Moses the
[1:53:59] leadership wherefore have you brought us
[1:54:02] up out of Egypt to die in this
[1:54:04] Wilderness for there is no bread neither
[1:54:06] is there no any water and our soul
[1:54:11] loatheth Angels
[1:54:13] food bread from
[1:54:16] heaven we hate
[1:54:18] it we
[1:54:21] hated and brother Brandon said when it
[1:54:24] comes it comes like the upper room with
[1:54:25] an old outpouring of the Holy Spirit and
[1:54:28] people get they get saturated with it
[1:54:32] and get joy in their heart come on and
[1:54:35] people despise it Angels food bread from
[1:54:38] Heaven Jesus Christ in the form of the
[1:54:41] Holy Ghost and a mixed multitude gets
[1:54:44] sick and tired of
[1:54:45] it lothus mean means a sickening
[1:54:52] dread I I I just dread going to church
[1:54:56] they're just going to expect me to be a
[1:54:57] priest in
[1:55:00] worship and offer a sacrifice of praise
[1:55:03] can you imagine that's what they're
[1:55:04] expecting of me I know I know they will
[1:55:06] I I
[1:55:08] know but I'm sick of it I'm just tired
[1:55:11] of that I'm tired of services like that
[1:55:13] I I just like it be
[1:55:18] well
[1:55:23] remember there more times in in Egypt
[1:55:27] down in our Catholic
[1:55:30] church we just said hell mares and
[1:55:32] jumped up and down a few times on our
[1:55:34] knees and that was it and we got out in
[1:55:36] 15 minutes you remember remember those
[1:55:39] old times and Presbyterians and oh how
[1:55:42] reverent it was wasn't even a
[1:55:47] sound you know there was never an amen
[1:55:50] or hallelujah or glory to God or nothing
[1:55:53] like that don't you remember how it was
[1:55:55] down in
[1:55:56] Egypt don't you remember how how it was
[1:55:59] you know we you know we back then we had
[1:56:02] that good old easy believism you just
[1:56:04] believe the message is right and you got
[1:56:06] the Holy Ghost there was no dying out to
[1:56:08] sin there was no weeping and snotting
[1:56:10] down in an altar there was no there was
[1:56:12] no real you know no need for real
[1:56:14] repentance we was oh that that's I tell
[1:56:17] you I tell you little SA ology that made
[1:56:20] us feel good a good my goodness you know
[1:56:24] wouldn't it be great if every once in a
[1:56:26] while we at least could have once a
[1:56:29] month anyhow maybe a little more often
[1:56:33] you know a a a good old you know good
[1:56:36] old sermon you know that would make us
[1:56:38] feel good and lift us up and you know a
[1:56:42] a good gal
[1:56:43] stream meeting that we we could have and
[1:56:46] we just all you know just clap our hands
[1:56:48] and go
[1:56:51] feeling how great I
[1:56:58] am you see they get weary of the word a
[1:57:04] Mana with full vitamins everything
[1:57:09] needed for the
[1:57:10] journey brother Brandon said in the
[1:57:12] message count down in 64 when a man is
[1:57:15] filled with the Holy Ghost there is
[1:57:17] something in him that is full of God's
[1:57:19] spiritual vitamins that makes him shout
[1:57:22] and praise God and act different because
[1:57:25] why he's no longer out Earthbound he's
[1:57:27] in the heavens sailing around in
[1:57:29] Heavenly places in Christ
[1:57:31] Jesus now let me just say you know and I
[1:57:35] know
[1:57:36] leaks onions and garlic they're not main
[1:57:44] courses they're just to flavor the
[1:57:48] food and so the gospel has been flavored
[1:57:53] by
[1:57:55] additions of Egypt's
[1:58:00] garlic who whoever sat down please don't
[1:58:04] raise your hand please don't but who
[1:58:07] ever sat down just to have a bowl of
[1:58:14] garlic you know they flavor food that
[1:58:16] they have a distinct taste so you get
[1:58:19] them variety you know you get Mexican
[1:58:21] food and Italian food and Indian food
[1:58:24] all or you know maybe the same Meats
[1:58:27] some of the same veggies or whatever but
[1:58:29] they have a different taste different
[1:58:32] flavor right and it comes from it comes
[1:58:36] from the the seasoning and the same true
[1:58:39] people crave certain foods we have
[1:58:42] Baptist flavors Methodist flavors
[1:58:45] Pentecostal flavors whatever you're
[1:58:46] liking and we have flavored the message
[1:58:50] with all kinds of flavor we want garlic
[1:58:52] of perusia or a lusen for th you know
[1:58:55] Coleman's Thunders or another Lust For
[1:58:57] headquarters in Jeffersonville or you
[1:59:00] know you know but the true Mana from
[1:59:04] Heaven has a distinct
[1:59:07] taste and it tastes like Wafers with
[1:59:10] honey try a little garlic on
[1:59:16] that man try a little garlic try try try
[1:59:19] to Munch an onion while while
[1:59:21] eating while eating this sweet
[1:59:27] wafer you're either crazy or you're
[1:59:35] pregnant
[1:59:38] hello but we have a Mana today that we
[1:59:42] can have food amen that is not tainted
[1:59:45] by man's flavor it's not got additions
[1:59:48] come on from
[1:59:49] Egypt amen it's a Mana without seed or
[1:59:53] bones in it it's Wafers that come down
[1:59:56] from heaven covered over with the
[1:59:58] sweetness of Heaven like David said it
[2:00:01] tastes like Honey in the
[2:00:04] Rock Hallelujah brother Brandon would
[2:00:07] always bring it around to this he said
[2:00:09] David a Shepherd boy knew to put honey
[2:00:11] on certain rocks for the mineral value
[2:00:13] and when the Sheep licked the honey he
[2:00:16] got the minerals from The Rock and he
[2:00:18] said when we put the honey on the Rock
[2:00:21] Christ Jesus sin and troubl go away when
[2:00:24] you lick on that rock healing is
[2:00:26] available for every sick sheep when you
[2:00:30] lick on the
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:34] Rock oh I hope there's a house full of
[2:00:36] people that loves that sweet Heavenly
[2:00:41] man but you know he would say to the
[2:00:45] ages now watch this is quoting brother
[2:00:47] Brandon but there's something I got
[2:00:50] against you and that is you left your
[2:00:52] first love you left that love you once
[2:00:56] had for them good oldfashioned Holy
[2:00:58] Ghost
[2:00:59] meetings and you begin to kind of slide
[2:01:02] backwards into that formal old come in
[2:01:04] with our father
[2:01:08] nonsense so that's how the devil got in
[2:01:10] the book of Acts
[2:01:11] church this is the way that brother
[2:01:13] Brandon describes it in the second seal
[2:01:15] some of them wanted a little more class
[2:01:18] to the message
[2:01:19] a little more finesse a little something
[2:01:22] more a little bit more
[2:01:24] refined something that is
[2:01:27] sophisticated and and so we become
[2:01:29] intellectual teachers instead of
[2:01:32] anointed preachers you see he never told
[2:01:35] us to go teach the gospel but to go
[2:01:39] preach the gospel and I'm quoting
[2:01:41] brother Brandon from Christ the mystery
[2:01:43] he said in other words demonstrate the
[2:01:46] power and these signs shall follow them
[2:01:49] that believe just teaching doesn't do it
[2:01:52] it takes actual Spirit itself
[2:01:55] demonstrating these
[2:01:57] signs but you know the first thing you
[2:01:59] know we become very educated and very
[2:02:02] refined in the message and we were going
[2:02:03] to preach the Deep things of God and
[2:02:06] buddy we later out here and there and
[2:02:08] you know and and the next thing you know
[2:02:12] speaking in tongues was baby talk and
[2:02:14] gifts of the Spirit was only for the
[2:02:16] immature and the the Holy Ghost well you
[2:02:19] know that was just dismissed as just to
[2:02:22] just just in a refined cultured way of
[2:02:26] just saying I believe the message and
[2:02:27] you got now now look Church you know I'm
[2:02:30] telling you the
[2:02:31] truth there's some of you been in those
[2:02:34] moves you know what I'm talking about
[2:02:37] Andy you know you know exactly what I'm
[2:02:40] talking about the Holy Ghost
[2:02:42] teaching of course Holy Ghost teaching
[2:02:44] is all right we want Holy Ghost anointed
[2:02:46] teachers it's needed in the body but but
[2:02:49] much of our teaching has come from the
[2:02:51] wisdom of man without any anointing to
[2:02:53] it and the Bible said they would keep to
[2:02:56] themselves teachers you know having itch
[2:02:59] and ears in other words the people pull
[2:03:03] on them to tell them what they want to
[2:03:07] hear you see real teaching uh is not
[2:03:11] educating real teaching is not
[2:03:14] intellectual stimulation true teaching
[2:03:17] settles the heart in faith and causes
[2:03:19] you to believe every word of God
[2:03:22] teaching is not dry lectures teaching
[2:03:25] must be
[2:03:29] anointed brother Bram said and we would
[2:03:31] see Jesus after the seals he said are
[2:03:33] you lecturing Jesus never said go into
[2:03:35] all the world and teach this or teach
[2:03:37] that he said go into all the world and
[2:03:39] preach the gospel preaches to
[2:03:41] demonstrate the power of God these signs
[2:03:43] have follow them it don't come by
[2:03:45] lecture that's right see that believe it
[2:03:48] doesn't come by by lectures it comes by
[2:03:51] uh it comes by the presence of the
[2:03:53] Living God moving among in human flesh
[2:03:55] proving himself he's the same yesterday
[2:03:57] today and forever that he never fails to
[2:03:59] be the same it comes so simple the
[2:04:02] Simplicity of it is what drives the
[2:04:05] intellectual mind away from
[2:04:08] it so again this is what Paul said I
[2:04:12] didn't come to you with Excellency of
[2:04:15] speech of our wisdom declaring to you
[2:04:18] the testimony of God my speech and my
[2:04:21] preaching was not with enticing words of
[2:04:24] man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the
[2:04:28] spirit and power that your faith should
[2:04:31] not stand in the wisdom of man but in
[2:04:34] the power of God you see when you get
[2:04:37] people's their faith standing in the
[2:04:39] wisdom of man well we understand the
[2:04:41] seals and we understand the Thunders and
[2:04:44] we've got this Revelation and we got an
[2:04:47] understanding greater than anybody else
[2:04:49] and your your faith is in that you see
[2:04:52] it will never stand you're going to fall
[2:04:54] away but your faith has got to be in the
[2:04:57] power of God I know I met him I know I
[2:05:01] had an experience I know he changed my
[2:05:04] life I have that testimony where my dead
[2:05:08] stick amen it came in the presence of
[2:05:11] God and it bore
[2:05:13] almonds I've got that witness in my life
[2:05:17] I know he's the same yesterday today and
[2:05:20] forever brother Brandon said we got
[2:05:22] people can stand up and explain the word
[2:05:24] in such a way it's just breathtaking but
[2:05:26] we find it's still just a lecture see
[2:05:29] it's the mechanics and that's the
[2:05:31] trouble we have had the mechanics and we
[2:05:35] have had it for 60 years going over and
[2:05:38] over and over and over you know this and
[2:05:42] that and looking at how the card work
[2:05:44] how carburetor works and how the valves
[2:05:46] are timed and making sure sure
[2:05:48] everything is exactly right and you know
[2:05:51] all of this and we fiddle fadle with it
[2:05:53] until it won't
[2:05:56] run amen we played around with it until
[2:05:59] it won't drive to Divine
[2:06:01] Healing and the sick lay
[2:06:04] sick come on Amen we've got to have a
[2:06:07] faith a greater Faith you say brother
[2:06:09] Tim that was for the Divine Healing
[2:06:11] movement no sir amen the change of our
[2:06:14] body is nothing but just more d
[2:06:19] power of the same Divine
[2:06:22] Healing and if there is no Divine
[2:06:24] Healing there is no
[2:06:30] Resurrection
[2:06:31] amen that's exactly right now instead of
[2:06:35] having preachers we got lectures men who
[2:06:37] know the word just as well can put it
[2:06:39] together in such a way it's astounding
[2:06:41] how they can do it they know the
[2:06:43] mechanics but that ain't the Dynamics we
[2:06:46] want the Dynamics I'm quoting brother
[2:06:48] brand I don't care about the mechanics I
[2:06:50] want to know the
[2:06:52] Dynamics that's amen I don't know how
[2:06:55] the car runs out there it's got piston
[2:06:57] cylinder I don't know how much pressure
[2:06:59] it's used the only thing I know is a
[2:07:01] dynamic put her out there and drive it
[2:07:04] sir that's what we know God made the
[2:07:07] promise I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[2:07:09] Flesh your sons and daughters shall
[2:07:12] prophesy how's he going to do it I can't
[2:07:14] tell you I just know the Dynamics of
[2:07:16] God's system I'll tell you what that's
[2:07:19] what the prophet
[2:07:20] wanted amen that's what we ought to want
[2:07:24] we I I believe I believe we have the
[2:07:27] mechanics I believe things are set in
[2:07:30] order I believe that we got the
[2:07:33] mysteries of God revealed in this day
[2:07:35] and our but they need to be quickened in
[2:07:37] our lives amen we need Faith to rise up
[2:07:41] in us when we see this sick something
[2:07:44] Rises up and but our God made a
[2:07:47] promise amen we're not just going to let
[2:07:50] the sick lay sick we're going to believe
[2:07:53] we're going to call Heaven down amen oh
[2:07:57] God help us to realize friend we're not
[2:08:00] in this alone we are not by ourself but
[2:08:03] a host of angels is on our side and the
[2:08:06] host on the other side are screaming out
[2:08:09] keep pressing the battle keep pressing
[2:08:11] the battle you don't know what's laying
[2:08:14] at the end of the
[2:08:16] road oh God let me get to the end that's
[2:08:20] what I say sometimes I get so weary of
[2:08:23] this I say Lord just let me get to the
[2:08:27] end I'm here I I don't know I don't know
[2:08:31] how far we are into this hour of
[2:08:34] Darkness but we pressed in we have keep
[2:08:37] pressing on keep pressing on I don't
[2:08:41] know church I don't know if it'll end in
[2:08:44] 2024 I don't know if it'll be over in in
[2:08:47] 20
[2:08:49] uh 27 I don't know when it's going to be
[2:08:53] amen all I know to do is keep pressing
[2:08:56] put another fo forward put another arrow
[2:08:59] in my bow stuck the enemy one more time
[2:09:02] amen stand on righteousness preach the
[2:09:05] truth amen call Heaven down let the Holy
[2:09:08] Spirit move that's all I know to do I

[2:11:22] light buls no AC no indoor toilets I've
[2:11:25] been in those places where you burn on
[2:11:27] one side and cold on the other from an
[2:11:29] old Barrel heater I've been in those
[2:11:32] places I know what dimly lit places are

[2:12:02] for a
[2:12:03] Rapture amen for God to come and live in
[2:12:05] your building where you have an arc of
[2:12:10] testimony and brother brandom said and I
[2:12:13] quote they couldn't bring him to a place
[2:12:16] where they were meeting in a little
[2:12:17] dirty dingy Hall clap their hands and
[2:12:19] Shout speaking in tongues getting
[2:12:21] messages he'd never believe it like that
[2:12:23] he's got to dress it up so what did the
[2:12:26] nickol of an age asked for it asked to
[2:12:28] get away from this bunch of people that
[2:12:30] shouts and clap their hands looks
[2:12:33] disgracefully like they did on Pentecost
[2:12:36] like drunk man act like drunk men
[2:12:38] staggering in the spirit they didn't
[2:12:40] want none of that they they said they
[2:12:41] were drunk and when the celebrity listen
[2:12:44] don't miss this it may sound crazy to
[2:12:46] you but it's the truth when the
[2:12:48] dignitaries began to come in they
[2:12:50] couldn't stoop to
[2:12:53] that so what they become
[2:12:58] embarrassed you know who is this mixed
[2:13:01] multitude there were people who were
[2:13:03] never called to leave Egypt but just
[2:13:06] went along and their heart was still in
[2:13:09] Egypt it was never in the promised
[2:13:11] land you see like like lot God called
[2:13:14] Abraham but Abraham called
[2:13:16] lot
[2:13:18] you you see they here they are can you
[2:13:20] imagine they are leaving the flesh pots
[2:13:23] and garlic in Egypt to eat Angels
[2:13:27] food and was still
[2:13:30] complaining leaving the boasting
[2:13:32] Physicians of Egypt say the days of
[2:13:35] Miracles are passed there's no such
[2:13:37] thing as Miracles no more and they go
[2:13:39] out to be with the people who who
[2:13:41] believe in the signs follen with sign of
[2:13:44] the king in the camp great wonders and
[2:13:46] signs a pillar of Fire hanging over them
[2:13:49] the blessings of fallen and spirits of
[2:13:51] Mana out of heaven and still grumbling
[2:13:54] insult to their

[2:14:09] the preachers stand up and preach songs

[2:14:15] you're just going on as a line of duty
[2:14:17] you're not a worshiper a worshiper goes
[2:14:20] there to worship to express himself
[2:14:22] before his God to praise God for his
[2:14:24] goodness to every word he hangs on to
[2:14:28] it amen oh my it's a precious
[2:14:33] word It's a Wonderful

[2:14:55] supposed to be but you know it becomes
[2:14:58] very
[2:14:59] common and what am I saying to you today

[2:15:06] common don't let it just be another

[2:15:48] of it Hallelujah and it doesn't have any
[2:15:52] denominational flavor out of it God made
[2:15:55] sure it was a Pure Clean unadulterated
[2:15:58] word of God and you ought to be able to
[2:16:00] taste it and that feels good and get so

[2:16:38] psychology you know what I'm talking
[2:16:40] about right Elisha and them that's they
[2:16:43] were trying to gather some
[2:16:46] food one of the preachers one of the
[2:16:48] young men went
[2:16:49] out and he picked some wild
[2:16:52] gourds and they got to taste them and
[2:16:55] said there's death in this
[2:16:57] pot this is going to kill us
[2:16:59] all they cried out to the prophet
[2:17:02] somebody's mixed death in this pot
[2:17:04] listen this is a problem this is a
[2:17:06] problem today there's too much death in
[2:17:08] the pot too many
[2:17:12] poisoned amen amen come on somebody went
[2:17:16] and got a weed of
[2:17:19] psychology I'll tell you now psychology
[2:17:21] is a weed that too many of our preachers
[2:17:23] are
[2:17:24] smoking hello and they've incorporated
[2:17:28] into the diet of the
[2:17:31] church are you with me amen and what is
[2:17:35] it they mix that in there hybridize this
[2:17:38] and you know mix this idea and what
[2:17:40] Dobson says and what this says or what
[2:17:43] some what some theologians said we don't
[2:17:46] need it mixed
[2:17:48] stuff we already got a Mana without
[2:17:51] seedar bones if you want flavored Mana
[2:17:54] get out there to the denomination that's
[2:17:56] where it's flavored but not
[2:17:59] here amen we don't want it flavored we
[2:18:02] want D say it the Lord we want the pure
[2:18:05] unadulterated word we want God in his
[2:18:08] power we want everything that's in the
[2:18:10] book we want what God Said Amen we're
[2:18:13] going to stick with what God
[2:18:15] Said Hallelujah
[2:18:22] oh
[2:18:24] my you know some have emphasized Greek
[2:18:30] words Greek words we need a few Greek
[2:18:33] lessons we're going to educate you on a
[2:18:35] Greek word here's a new Greek word for
[2:18:37] the week you know they tried that with
[2:18:39] brother Brandon a Baptist man said
[2:18:41] brother Brandon we'll never have Revival
[2:18:43] until we get the Bible exactly right we
[2:18:45] got to go back and examine the Greek and
[2:18:48] you know word by word and letter by
[2:18:49] letter and find the Greek interpretation
[2:18:51] what the Greeks said he said man they've
[2:18:54] been arguing about the Greek cian
[2:18:56] Council it's not to know the Greek is
[2:18:59] life it's to know him that's
[2:19:01] life amen you see Wild GS death in the
[2:19:05] pot but what did he do to remedy that he
[2:19:08] said he took a handful of
[2:19:11] meal and that meal represented Christ
[2:19:14] and it was all ground with the same Bur
[2:19:17] made it in Jesus Christ the same
[2:19:19] yesterday today and forever and he took
[2:19:22] that and put it back in the pot put it
[2:19:24] in the pot and it healed the po took the
[2:19:27] poison out you want the poison of false
[2:19:30] Doctrine out amen put Jesus Christ back
[2:19:34] in the church the same yesterday today
[2:19:36] and forever the same in power the same
[2:19:39] anointing the same Holy Ghost the same
[2:19:43] as always come on Jesus Christ the same
[2:19:46] and it healed the pot
[2:19:47] [Applause]
[2:19:51] hallelujah amen but you know some they
[2:19:55] get a taste of the
[2:19:58] Mana
[2:20:01] and before the next Revival they got to
[2:20:04] go out and get renewed
[2:20:07] again so they run from revival to
[2:20:12] Revival they run from camp meeting to
[2:20:15] camp meeting now camp meeting is okay
[2:20:18] Revival meens are okay that's what they
[2:20:21] used to
[2:20:24] call special meetings was Revival those
[2:20:28] are okay they're fine but you know in
[2:20:33] between
[2:20:34] revivals if your experience is dropping
[2:20:38] out and you're losing what you
[2:20:41] had you need to go further with
[2:20:45] God it's okay to go to re rival sure go
[2:20:48] go there encourage somebody else lift
[2:20:50] them up amen e even even eat some more
[2:20:54] Mana Rejoice ever
[2:20:57] more are you with me but friends if
[2:21:01] you're if it's running out from meeting
[2:21:03] to meeting then go a little further when
[2:21:06] God than you went die out to sin because
[2:21:10] you
[2:21:11] see there's too many that are like a
[2:21:14] broken system that can hold no watch
[2:21:18] so they wa they first of all a a sister
[2:21:22] has to wait for for Revival Reigns to
[2:21:27] get filled
[2:21:29] up and you know we had one down at the
[2:21:31] farm in PL de when I was a boy well
[2:21:34] mosquitoes would breed in we had an old
[2:21:35] screen up there that would keep the
[2:21:37] leaves out of it and you know it ran off
[2:21:39] the top of the house and and and
[2:21:41] whatever and went there the well the
[2:21:43] well was always going dry in that place
[2:21:46] and so you could never never depend on
[2:21:49] on good fresh water so you had to have
[2:21:51] sister water too and that sist water
[2:21:54] they you know the rain would come and
[2:21:57] you know the chickens rusted on that
[2:21:59] Barn then the you get the drift you know
[2:22:03] the the dirt kicked up from the plow and
[2:22:07] everything's on that Barn it all washes
[2:22:09] right down into the sistern well you
[2:22:10] just got a screen where you screen the
[2:22:12] leaves out and now you got cyan
[2:22:15] water don't drink
[2:22:18] he'll give you the
[2:22:21] trots
[2:22:23] amen but you see I mean it's death in
[2:22:26] the
[2:22:28] pot amen and and that's the way a lot of
[2:22:31] people are but it can be even worse
[2:22:34] Jeremiah said because they have sisters
[2:22:38] and they're
[2:22:39] broken and they hold no water so they're
[2:22:42] worse off than a sister that's right
[2:22:46] because they don't even have Revival
[2:22:48] Waters so that's what brother bradam
[2:22:50] would talk about broken sister and he
[2:22:52] said these sister would be filled up
[2:22:54] from revival to Revival listen you're
[2:22:57] not to be a sistern you are to be a well
[2:23:01] of Living Water springing up up to
[2:23:06] everlasting life come on something on
[2:23:10] the inside of you pushing
[2:23:12] out Hallelujah it'll push out sin it'll
[2:23:15] push out unbelief will push out
[2:23:18] whirling amen and also out of it will
[2:23:21] come a bubbling out of you the joy of
[2:23:23] the Lord hallelujah that no man created
[2:23:27] but it's coming because there's a life
[2:23:29] that is down on the inside of you
[2:23:31] pushing it
[2:23:33] out you're still happy because the
[2:23:35] spirit of God is in there and it's
[2:23:38] bubbling
[2:23:39] forth praise the
[2:23:42] Lord now you can go into this and I'm
[2:23:46] just going to take take maybe the next
[2:23:48] few
[2:23:50] minutes just to deal with it but let me
[2:23:52] read this quote yesterday's Mana is
[2:23:57] contaminated I hear people say 40 years
[2:23:59] ago I did so and so that's right but
[2:24:03] what about
[2:24:04] today what about the church on fire we
[2:24:08] talk about yesterday what about the
[2:24:11] church today what about you as an
[2:24:13] individual today for yesterday's won't
[2:24:16] do for today it was all right
[2:24:19] yesterday so again he talked about the
[2:24:22] light and he said it all must blend
[2:24:26] together and he said what it ought to
[2:24:28] have done was blend with it and went on
[2:24:30] to make the perfect loaf of bread went
[2:24:32] to make perfect perfect manner of
[2:24:35] God but now as we as as I just bring it
[2:24:39] down here for a moment and I I want to
[2:24:42] bring some of these points because I
[2:24:44] don't want to pick it up
[2:24:45] again
[2:24:48] but he he talks about this in the
[2:24:51] messages Eagle stirs her nest some of
[2:24:54] the brothers have touched on this I've
[2:24:56] had this in my notes for the last six
[2:24:59] weeks probably just trying to get to
[2:25:02] this but he talks about this and Eagle
[2:25:04] stirs her
[2:25:06] nest and he and and and right down to
[2:25:11] the end like SE not a with the shuck
[2:25:14] anointed ones in the end time all the
[2:25:17] message he brings his principle
[2:25:19] out and that is how that an eagle is
[2:25:23] meant to fly in the
[2:25:26] heavenlies and how that
[2:25:28] God is like an eagle and he and an eagle
[2:25:33] doesn't want his little family his
[2:25:36] little chicks Little Eagles little
[2:25:39] eaglets to be
[2:25:42] Earthbound so you know it's it's a time
[2:25:45] that they're in the nest
[2:25:47] but there comes a time that they have to
[2:25:49] leave the nest and Learn to
[2:25:54] Fly amen amen now so he he goes on to
[2:25:58] talk about this and and he equates it
[2:26:01] with the church he he uses the pattern
[2:26:03] of the hop The Hop he he types with
[2:26:06] Pentecost said they they've got where
[2:26:08] that they just vulture down on things
[2:26:10] they waiting for a a dead rabbit there
[2:26:13] on the road to eat and they're wait
[2:26:16] they're they're waiting to find
[2:26:17] something like that they want they don't
[2:26:20] have fresh
[2:26:22] Mana but he said that's not the way the
[2:26:24] eagle is to be his Eagle is to be always
[2:26:27] fresh where the carcass is the eagle
[2:26:30] Shall Gather you said well now brother
[2:26:33] Tim uh Eagles are vultures too they'll
[2:26:36] eat dead things well of course of course
[2:26:40] any any animal will be forced out of his
[2:26:43] habitat but if it gets his preference a
[2:26:47] a a real a real Eagle especially the
[2:26:50] golden eagle it will it wants fresh it
[2:26:54] wants to kill it fresh he doesn't really
[2:26:57] vulture eyesee down now if he's hungry
[2:26:59] he'll do anything I used to raise Dairy
[2:27:01] goats and people don't understand about
[2:27:03] goats they think they're
[2:27:05] nasty but a goat would not
[2:27:07] drink it would not drink my goats would
[2:27:10] not drink out of water that was
[2:27:14] stale they would not drink out of water
[2:27:17] that was contaminated if they stuck
[2:27:20] their feet in a accidentally stuck their
[2:27:23] feet in a grain pan and and got a a
[2:27:27] little bit of their foot in there and
[2:27:30] and messed around in the grain pan they
[2:27:32] would not eat it they were clean
[2:27:36] animals and so but if you forc them out
[2:27:39] of their habitat if you force them out
[2:27:42] of their natural ways you can force a
[2:27:45] goat I saw in Africa drink out of a mud
[2:27:49] puddle because there was no other
[2:27:53] source are you with me so they can be
[2:27:56] forced to an eagle there can be forced
[2:28:00] out of hunger starvation and the eating
[2:28:02] things that it would that it doesn't
[2:28:05] prefer but it prefers the fresh killed
[2:28:09] meat are you with me and brother brother
[2:28:12] brandham Todd went to Great Lengths and
[2:28:15] preaching about this and he said what it
[2:28:17] is he said that the the the thing that
[2:28:20] they're trying to eat on is Mana from
[2:28:22] another day and they're not taking the
[2:28:25] fresh killed meat of the word the
[2:28:28] message of the
[2:28:29] hour are you with me so they vultz down
[2:28:33] like that and they just hop from carcass
[2:28:35] to carcass to carcass like that and he
[2:28:38] said the hawk which is a lesser brother
[2:28:40] to the eagle it's like the Pentecostal
[2:28:42] they just hoop from one carcass to the
[2:28:44] other and doing that he said I saw a
[2:28:46] hawk there doing that the other day
[2:28:48] listen let me tell you again let me tell
[2:28:50] you again friends you know many of them
[2:28:54] they would prefer to have the right meat
[2:28:58] but it ain't available to them that's
[2:28:59] right but that's not your problem that's
[2:29:02] right God has given you the fresh meat
[2:29:05] of the word and the way that you want it
[2:29:08] this is the way we want it we want it so
[2:29:11] fresh we want it so fresh that when the
[2:29:15] Ripper of the beak pars it open the
[2:29:18] blood flows and when the blood flows it
[2:29:20] gets all over the
[2:29:22] eagle amen that's the way you want it
[2:29:25] you want the Holy Ghost full of life
[2:29:28] until the life of God comes all over you
[2:29:31] as you eat of the word as you pull on it
[2:29:33] here it comes the blood
[2:29:37] flows Hallelujah when you get out of
[2:29:39] church everybody knows you've been

[2:30:11] hallelujah praise the Lord prise the
[2:30:14] Lord amen yes so not less of Christ more
[2:30:19] Christ amen but the perfect word
[2:30:23] now coming down brother Timothy brought
[2:30:26] it out in one of his
[2:30:28] sermons but he talks about an eagle
[2:30:31] doesn't want
[2:30:32] his his little eaglets to be
[2:30:37] Earthbound builds his nest way up high
[2:30:41] makes it where that he gets up there and
[2:30:44] then there Comes A Time where he wants
[2:30:48] to take it on a
[2:30:50] flight well some say well brother Tim
[2:30:53] there ain't no Eagle that ever took a
[2:30:55] bird another eaglet on the flight well
[2:30:57] all I know is is God said I carried you
[2:31:01] on wings like an
[2:31:03] eagle all I know is in Revelation chap
[2:31:06] 12 he said and he gave and he gave the
[2:31:09] woman two wings as an eagle that's to
[2:31:13] fly to fly Old and New Testament all I
[2:31:16] know is is that this
[2:31:20] Eagle will bear you upon its
[2:31:24] wings amen carry you in the
[2:31:27] heavenlies and then drop you off amen so
[2:31:31] that you will yeah so that you will
[2:31:34] learn how to
[2:31:36] fly I wonder if God ain't doing that to
[2:31:38] some of us let some things happen in our
[2:31:41] lives that makes us have to exercise our
[2:31:45] wings amen man to use our faith a little
[2:31:48] bit come on church and he said is those
[2:31:51] Eagles there those little eaglets
[2:31:52] they'll go tumbling down on the inside
[2:31:55] over and over and whatever he said now
[2:31:58] they get out of
[2:32:00] order but let them fly they're trying to
[2:32:04] learn how to fly and he said don't worry
[2:32:07] about them getting out of order the the
[2:32:10] mother Eagle will come back with her two
[2:32:12] Wings Hallelujah and bear them back up
[2:32:16] the grace
[2:32:17] again I'm not worrying about order I'm
[2:32:21] wanting to see eagles fly I want them to
[2:32:24] see that all things are possible I want
[2:32:27] them to see Jesus Christ is real I want
[2:32:30] them to see they can have the same Holy
[2:32:32] Ghost they had on the day of Pentecost I
[2:32:35] want them to have the same Mana the same
[2:32:38] Holy Ghost the same outpouring I want to
[2:32:41] see them have
[2:32:43] Mana that never grows stale
[2:32:47] our breed worms let's stand
[2:32:51] together hallu you said well brother Tim
[2:32:54] that's just not happening where we are
[2:32:57] well then go and you beyond the camp
[2:33:00] listen to this I'll just let the the
[2:33:02] prophet answer for you now in this Camp
[2:33:06] miracles signs and wonders was in this
[2:33:09] Camp they moved them out to the
[2:33:10] Wilderness they left the natural Camp
[2:33:13] they left the mud Camp they left the the
[2:33:15] camp made with straw and brick to dwell
[2:33:18] in tents out in the wilderness where
[2:33:20] there was no grain or nothing else
[2:33:22] sometimes God ask us to do foolish
[2:33:24] things our own thinking and if you'll
[2:33:26] ever leave the camp of your own reason
[2:33:29] that's the place you'll find God now as
[2:33:32] soon as they went out in the wilderness
[2:33:34] there was Miracle signs when they moved
[2:33:36] out in this Camp remember they left
[2:33:38] Egypt's Camp moved out of the Wilderness
[2:33:40] with God's Camp how do you know it was
[2:33:43] God said your people sojourn for 400
[2:33:45] years years but I'll bring them out with
[2:33:47] a mighty hand I'll give them this land
[2:33:49] here and there they were on the road by
[2:33:52] Vindicated light a Vindicated Prophet
[2:33:54] with signs and wonders that God was in
[2:33:57] the camp and they were there on their
[2:33:59] Road they had a pillar of fire they had
[2:34:02] a prophet they had Mana they had Living
[2:34:05] Waters they had changed
[2:34:08] campgrounds you remember when you did
[2:34:10] Brother Gary you left those campgrounds
[2:34:13] out there to come to campgrounds amen
[2:34:16] where that there was miracles signs and
[2:34:19] wonders amen they had to change
[2:34:22] campgrounds in order to see the
[2:34:24] supernatural so will the people of this
[2:34:26] day have to change the camp from them
[2:34:29] denominations that say the days of
[2:34:31] Miracles has passed there's no such
[2:34:33] thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:34:35] all these other scriptures are wrong and
[2:34:37] they work for they work for another age
[2:34:40] you have to change your Campground and
[2:34:43] be go beyond the camp where all things
[2:34:46] things are
[2:34:50] possible
[2:34:51] Mana that will never grow
[2:34:54] stale if your Mana is
[2:34:58] rotten if your experience has got
[2:35:03] warmy if you allowed bitterness in your
[2:35:07] life if you allow things that shouldn't
[2:35:10] be come on in a little
[2:35:13] further come on into the presence of God
[2:35:18] God come
[2:35:20] where the do drops of Mercy are
[2:35:24] bright where that the Mana never
[2:35:30] ceases want you to Bow your heads
[2:35:32] together with
[2:35:40] me you tired of
[2:35:42] being mixed
[2:35:44] multitude
[2:35:48] [Music]
[2:35:51] tired of being complainer
[2:35:55] murmer the journey is so
[2:35:58] hard things are so
[2:36:04] difficult you want your joy
[2:36:08] back you can have that
[2:36:11] Joy Jesus Christ is our Living
[2:36:14] Hope
[2:36:20] you want that peace that surpasses all
[2:36:24] understanding you want to be able to
[2:36:26] love your
[2:36:27] enemy you want to be able to love God
[2:36:30] and hate
[2:36:35] sin I get I get
[2:36:38] embarrassed I get embarrassed talk about
[2:36:42] embarrassed I get embarrassed I see
[2:36:44] so-called Christian
[2:36:47] see a girl that out in some skimpy dress
[2:36:52] I'm talking
[2:36:53] about supposed to be a believer some
[2:36:56] kind of skimpy
[2:36:57] garment dress above the knees or doing
[2:37:01] something they shouldn't be doing or
[2:37:03] maybe in a bathing suit all these likes
[2:37:07] and oh you look so adorable or pictures
[2:37:10] of them with full of makeup oh you're so
[2:37:13] adorable you're so cute
[2:37:18] how manyan likes what in the world is
[2:37:21] wrong how in the world could you do that
[2:37:25] of course you don't want to get on there
[2:37:26] and
[2:37:30] say something
[2:37:32] derogatory but sometimes I wonder if you
[2:37:35] couldn't just be a witness and step up
[2:37:36] and say
[2:37:38] look we ought to present Christ before
[2:37:42] the world and this in Christ
[2:37:47] do you love the
[2:37:51] world you love the things of the
[2:37:55] world the love the father is not in
[2:37:59] you there is
[2:38:02] Mana there's a place that you can have
[2:38:05] this
[2:38:06] Mana that your experience will never
[2:38:08] grow stale no
[2:38:10] more never breed
[2:38:12] worms you cannot ever be classified as
[2:38:15] lukewarm cold and
[2:38:17] formal because it's bubbling up into
[2:38:20] eternal
[2:38:23] life it's right behind the
[2:38:26] veil you got to go beyond your veil of
[2:38:28] reasoning got to go beyond that Veil
[2:38:30] that says days of Miracles are passed
[2:38:32] God don't do anything like that anymore
[2:38:35] we can't live like that that's just you
[2:38:37] know we just have to take a
[2:38:39] denominational life you got to go beyond
[2:38:41] those
[2:38:43] veils because there at Calvary he told
[2:38:45] tore down the veils to seek
[2:38:47] Christ The Living Christ since Calvary
[2:38:51] man has put up their own
[2:38:53] veils God is not veiling himself away
[2:38:56] from you the Mighty God is unveiled
[2:38:59] before us this is the unveiling of God
[2:39:04] but what has
[2:39:06] veiled is denominational theories of men
[2:39:10] want to hide God from you come on past
[2:39:14] them come on into his
[2:39:17] presence ask God ever more Lord give us
[2:39:20] this bread from
[2:39:23] heaven let it Satisfy My thirsting
[2:39:28] Soul pour a fresh on me Lord but in the
[2:39:32] inner Veil where I just get another
[2:39:35] handful if I'm hungry I don't have to
[2:39:38] wait for Revival I don't have to wait
[2:39:41] for a special move in the
[2:39:43] church it's there all the time
[2:39:47] whether I'm up or whether I'm down
[2:39:49] whether it's
[2:39:51] trouble all the same time I'm constant
[2:39:54] on the
[2:39:55] inside because my light never grows
[2:39:59] dim the Mana never goes
[2:40:02] stale and there's always
[2:40:05] evidence a
[2:40:10] reminder of how he changed my
[2:40:13] life father bless these words
[2:40:17] today bless them to the hearts of your
[2:40:20] children may they just move into your
[2:40:23] presence today

[2:40:29] Way I pray oh God if there be among us
[2:40:34] any of a
[2:40:37] heart that has got
[2:40:39] embarrassed or maybe they remember leaks
[2:40:42] or garlic or they looked over and seen
[2:40:44] what others have with their leaks and
[2:40:46] garlic they want that may they come back
[2:40:49] to you today may they be a full
