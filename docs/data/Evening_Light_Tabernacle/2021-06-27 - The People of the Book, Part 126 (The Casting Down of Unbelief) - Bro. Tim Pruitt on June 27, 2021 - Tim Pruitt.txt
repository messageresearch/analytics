verse this morning and looking into the word of god amen expecting the exceeding abundantly we're going to be speaking on the casting down of unbelief amen because when we cast satan down we're casting down unbelief amen and of course we none of us should disbelieve in this day after god's done so much to confirm his word what right have we got to disbelieve any promise amen amen we have received a more sure word of prophecy thank you lord revelation 12 and verse 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not just remind the devil right now he ain't going to win and the the dragon fought and his angels prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their confession their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice your heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth unto the sea for the devils come down to you having great wrath because he knoweth he had half but a short time just three and a half years amen and his time is going to be over with amen god bless you can be seated last sunday we spoke on the advances of science and that has brought us into new realms that has been previously unknown to mankind and until we are now naturally a supernatural people commonly doing every day without thinking about it using the invisible world of radio waves and microwaves and electricity and we have expand we had advanced way beyond our forefathers and we have advanced to into what was one time only the imaginary fiction world even um you know they used to have a cartoon or comic character dick tracy that they would imagine and and kind of you know try to try to imagine what it would be one day and now we are here advanced in that very time and brother branham told us um about this he said i was thinking about the few moments ago upon the subject of science how that they are taking the natural man and how he's went into the research from the fall of the natural and what he has done and how little the spiritual man has progressed in the kingdom of god he said i was thinking about how science is done but then how little the spiritual man has done and i was thinking that the natural man went out of the at the unseen of his eye and pulled an atom out of the sky and split that atom in two that destroys human life and if the natural man that knows nothing of god and cannot know nothing of god except he'd be converted then his soul becomes alive with the supernatural if he could do that in the natural realm what ought the man of god to be doing my my friends the church is so far behind let's pray my my that god will move his church up the natural man with natural resources is getting greater results than the people that calls himself christian let's press into the unseen the blessings are yours they are for you amen so i'll tell you what we have room for advancement and i think that's what the prophet of god was calling for us to do as we look around and see what the church world has done then we ought to be able to look at our own self and the promises of the word of god and say let's advance all the way into it it's rapture hour it's rapture time now he would explain it like this in this in the israel in the church he would talk about um three different uh spheres that um like one is where the nominal church is and up here is the sublime and and where we're supposed to be right next to the door to heaven where the powers of god are leaking down it drops on down through this and that one and he said it then this is a norm nominal church it goes on into just on on down into cold professions just a ritualistic affair that's the nominal church they get the slight drippings the next up here a little higher than that is the full gospel they get some of the blessings but they go off into islands if we've got to lift into this next sphere here before we can ever have a rapture it's exactly you got to get up in that before we can ever have it so you know there there's another realm higher to go in christ everybody ought to be an enoch to stay looking for another step another step higher amen not satisfied with where you are and i think as a church body we should not be satisfied there but look to the promise again he said no wonder christianity cannot lift her standard it's not because christ is not able but because the people won't do it the the message is ready the power of god is sufficient and men and women are scared to break out yonder into those fears before god and dare to trust him and take him at his word amen so we are people that are challenged to move into higher realms than any has ever walked iman even as faith um because somebody believed it could be done uh if it was if it was um edison or or emerson or the different men scientists if they were looking at a light bulb they believed it could be done they believed they could find a way and they worked at it until they they made it work and man what was it there was a drive and a passion in there they believed it could be done and we've got to believe that the word of god is going to be fulfilled in this hour and put our faith to work to move up into realms and you know no matter how many tries we have made to never give up to always persevere amen no matter how many times we prayed and it didn't seem like that prayer accomplished anything we pray again the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much it is over and over he tells us of the unjust judge you know of the woman that come to him and he said i don't fear god and i don't fear man but i tell you what i know this woman ain't going to give up till i give her what she wants and he said so will god give to you that ask of him but he's looking for a people that are perseverant who are persistent with persistent faith to hold on to a divine promise of god now but brother branham said what has happened is that men and women are afraid or they're scared to break out yonder in those fears before god and to dare to trust him and to take him at his word you know why why it makes him scared is because it's the devil he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army so of course she brings every kind of gossip of unbelief every kind of doubt every kind of fear every kind of thing to make you afraid and man so so that he can try to keep you from reaching higher from grasping a greater promise amen so you know he'll bring every every accusation he bring every imagination he'll bring every temptation he'll bring every kind of thing that you're going to fight it in the in the heavenly realms the more you move toward god the more you're going to be opposed by wicked spirits and i'll tell you what i must be getting really close to god because the devil has really been coming against us but i tell you greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world but you know there we have been given these things to cast down strongholds you know we live in the flesh but we don't wage war according to the flesh the weapons of our warfare we're taught are not weapons of the world but instead they are divine power to demolish strongholds and when we tear down arguments all the devil will argue against you he's always got a he's a debater now hey man he'll always bring an argument against where you're standing and reasoning and doubts and confusion and different kinds of reports and everything else he'll bring you memory of what happened to somebody else i mean they had this problem and they they had this situation and they had to live with their problem a long long time but i'm telling you right now we are casting down imaginations every presumption every argument that is set up against the knowledge of god and we take every thought somebody say everything every thought and make it obedient to christ amen now it's war we're reading you there as war heavens you you're you're battling it out and you're gonna have war we're here in this end time we're having war and for every believer it's time you get higher and every time you try to get higher in god every time you try to possess god's promise you just got to fight more amen now but you know he said in jeremiah 1 and 10 he said see this day i have set thee over nations and over the kingdoms to root out to pull down to destroy to throw down to build and to plant this is where god has set us i want you to see yourself as being positioned by almighty god amen i want to remind the devil this morning i have been positioned in a place of power and authority for he hath made us kings and priests to rule over a man and he'll set us over nations and over kingdoms to root out to pull down to destroy to throw down amen and to build up god's kingdom and to plant in righteousness now ephesians 6 11 we have been in the scripture and i want to just go through it again but put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil now why didn't god just say look you don't need an armor i've done got it done i died at calvary i paid the price i'm the captain and i'm leading in battle and i've defeated the devil but no you got to go defeat your own david killed a goliath but you got to take your sword now come on now so put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand stand take your stand and not back up not retreat amen but stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places it's war but put on the whole army of god dress for war put on the precepts of his word am i just like a the armor of a heavenly armed soldier so arm yourself with god's word amen every day amen taking that word i don't care if you're you know if you got to the point you think you're up to here and you got all the problems you know just don't even feel like eating you got to make yourself eat hey man you just keep right on cramming it down amen tell you maybe at the moment you can't digest it but do it anyhow repeat it back claim that promise lay hold on eternal life it's yours to grasp amen you know again the smoke of the battle may be so thick you can't even see through it but i want you to know god place you here today amen don't worry about the future amen don't worry about the end result look at winning the battle today we've got a battle to win today it is battle by battle that we finally win the war [Applause] now we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and power against rulers of the doctrines of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places that is the word is eperano and ranios and that word right there is the same one in all the scripture and all of ephesians when he says heavenly places so all our blessings lies in heavenly places ephesians 1 tells us that he hath blessed us with where all how many all spiritual blessings where and heavenly places so you're going to have to take the heavenlies amen in order you're going to have to change from the spirit you're in of si of since bound knowledge of cease taste smell filling here and move by the realm of faith to possess that promise are you with me now because that's where we're blessed we are not blessed in the sense real knowledge we are blessed when we take faith and we claim our inheritance and pull from god from the heavens what belongs to us but satan's there to fight i don't want to battle well then you'll just be asleep you have no other choice there's no other recourse surrender and be a slave you're going to be a you're going to surrender who wants to be a slave to the devil then you're going to have to fight now you're going to have to fight for your inheritance you're going to have to fight for your health for divine healing you're going to have to fight for your finances you're going to have to fight for your marriage you're going to have to fight for your children ain't nothing you're going to have to fight for your church come on you're going to have to fight everywhere that you look on every corner you're going to have to fight in heavenly places brother branham said not just out anywhere in heavenly places we are assembled in heavenly it means the position of the believer remember you're it's not a flesh and blood affair so no matter how matter how good you can reason how good you can think how smart you are you know you can what you see what you taste what you smell what you hear it you know there again that's not where you win the battle it means the position of the believer so you are positioned there in heavenly places that is if i'm prayed up if you're prayed up or the church has prayed up and we're ready for the message that's why we have these tremendous and blessed song services you know what it's for is to encourage you to get out of sense bound realms into the realms where all things are possible amen we and we assembled ourselves together as saints we're called out baptized with the holy ghost filled with god's blessings called elected set together in heavenly places now we our heavenlies in our soul our spirit has brought us into heavenly atmosphere amen oh brother there you are heavenly atmosphere oh what could happen if we're sitting here in the heavenly atmosphere and the holy spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in christ all sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to god with our hearts lifted sitting in heavenly places worshiping together in the heavenlies places oh did you ever said in one oh he said i've sat till i could weep for joy and say god never let me leave here just heavenly places in christ jesus blessing us with what divine healing for knowledge revelation visions powers tongues interpretation wisdom knowledge all heavenly blessings and joy unspeakable and full of glory every heart filled with the spirit walking together sitting together in heavenly places not an evil thought among us not one cigarette smoked not one short dress not one this that or the other not one evil thought nothing nobody's got anything against another everybody's speaking in love and harmony everybody with one accord in one place and then suddenly there comes a sound from heaven like a russian mighty will you say brother tim it'd be impossible to get everybody here like that well i'll tell you just don't worry about everybody here just worry about your one person and bring bringing heaven down to you amen because if heaven will come down to you the same rest almighty will can come and fill your house hallelujah amen and he said there he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings and then the holy spirit might might fall upon somebody and say thus saith the lord and go to a certain place and do a certain thing amen i'll tell you what i'm still riding on a word of comfort given to me a series of victories is going to be hallelujah amen ephesians 1 and 3 blessed be the god and our father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with let's go to this together how many oh pretty inclusive isn't it spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ now brother branham you know define that divine healing for knowledge revel revelation visions powers tongues interpretation wisdom knowledge all heavenly blessings joy and speakable full of glory every heart filled with the spirit so he had blessed us with all spiritual blessings and heavenly places in christ now we might be blessed here on earth you know but our blessings come from being seated with christ this is where our blessed blessings come it's because our position that the blood has placed us we're sons and daughters of god we have been adopted into his kingdom we're not waiting on adoption we have received adoption amen you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you so you see your your sons of god we're not waiting on our sonship we have received our sonship now verse 17 of chapter 1 of ephesians that the god of our lord jesus christ the father glory may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the under eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you might know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of his glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believed according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him in his own right hand in the heavenly places so he's showing you look what he did in christ he raised him from the dead and set him in the heavenlies this is what he does for you he has quickened you raised you with christ and has set you in the heavenlies and what's now far above all principalities did we read that in ephesians 6 what we're fighting against he's already set you above it he's already made you rulers over those rulers come on now he gave you in mark 16 the authority to cast out satan to pull down your strongholds to take your promises amen so he said he set christ at his own right hand and he's just showing you what he did in christ he's going to do in you he said for above all principality and power and might and dominion and they ever named it his name now you just name it he said well it's cancer well you're you have dominion over cancer and when you say well it's it's a problem here it's he has you have dominion over that problem what did he say far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and it put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church we'll come back to this in a little bit if i can but anyway he put all things under his feet made him to be the head and he and over all things to the church which is his body so if it's under his feet and we are his body then he's under your feet is that right amen so he made him to be head or gave him preeminence over all things the church which is his body which is the fullness of him that filleth all and all and you now we just talked about christ let's talk about you and you hath he made alive who were dead in trespasses and sin wherein times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the heir the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom we also had the way we lived our manner of living our conversation in times past and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as other but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and since he hath quickened us together with christ he had made us alive together with christ by grace you are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus now he gave he gives you a position of authority but not only that just by representation just by representation tell you think about this morning we just had a we just had a great convention there in north carolina brother timothy was there as brother timothy ministered we were ministering even like tabernacle come on was there why because we had a representation there so we know when we have a man christ jesus who has been exalted to dominion and throne because that man is there all sons of god are there are you with me america went to the moon i didn't but we did is that right amen so we have been to the moon why because america went to the moon and we are america amen so christ went into the heavens we are in the heavens amen because a man went there the man christ jesus furthermore a man opened the seals a man took the book a man is in possession of the title and if that man is in possession of the title then all of his children are in possession of that title hallelujah now i won't make a badness out because they never understand that but i ought to make a message believers shout hallelujah because the seventh seal is open and the silence has been broken and our name has been shown in the book and a man there has claimed the inheritance and he claimed it for you and he claimed it from me and because he has it we have it [Applause] because he has it we have it because he's alive we're alive because he's enthroned we are enthralled because he's in power we're in power [Applause] and that gives us authority then to act in his name on the earth now we fight because we're in a spiritual battle it's not a flesh and blood affair although it really gets right down into flesh and blood [Music] amen because demons have invade your flesh and you feel like it's just a battle in your body but it's more than fleshly it's spiritual amen some of you are going through battles with cancer i'll tell you what is more than a physical battle it's a spiritual battle amen some of you are going to a battle with other things in your health and what is more than a physical you're looking at the physical jesus didn't look at the physical he looked at the spiritual is that right amen he called every sickness there whether it was epilepsy whether whatever it was he called it the devil didn't he a man if a man was crippled up if it was arthritis if it was paralytic he called it the devil he didn't deal with the flesh and the blood and man he didn't deal with it he you know he didn't go to with the woman there with the blood issue and fix the blood issue he do what he dealt dealt with the spirit that was troubling her and when the enemy was gone she was healed are you with me now satan is a squatter because he he is its perverter and this earth is under a curse remember the earth was cursed with man and and remember also your body is earth your body is just the bible said the lord god formed man out of the dust of the ground and we are destined to return to the ground because for out of it that was taken for just our heart and unto death shalt thou return you remember that amen genesis 2 17 curse it is the ground for thy sake in sorrow thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field so they're there again there again we we know the the ground is cursed now jesus as the word became flesh and took on dust he took that dust body down to the river jordan and it was baptized and filled with the holy ghost same thing you got to do with yours you take your dust body down to the altar surrender to god and say here lord i give it come possess this vessel you're baptized in his name meaning he it now belongs to him amen what is he doing claiming your earth for the resurrection is that right now so that jesus as the word became flesh took on dust and redeemed that part of dust by his blood and payment for sin so he could redeem your body as brother branham explained it and proven his word and and uh i think it was a future home he said and goes there he said he took that cursed earth and took it down to the river jordan and had it baptized in obedience come on amen and it was filled with the holy spirit and he said from this part of the earth i have redeemed i'm going to redeem the rest of it i'll redeem every other one i'm going to redeem the whole earth hallelujah if you look toward the future we're not going to get a new earth in the sense that god's going to just create a a complete new thing any he it will pass from one form to another it will be clean stuff and just like he washed it off with water at with noah and baptize your world with water shed his blood up on it with calvary and then he will baptize it with fire come on somebody and what will he do he will make it a dwelling place for him to live on the earth will be redeemed your body is also for redemption now divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection in other words the earnest of your body change it just simply shows if god can heal a body amen he can heal the whole body amen so divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection and salvation is claiming your body by placing the deposit of god's own life within it that's the holy ghost the holy ghost is a deposit until the fullness comes it's a down payment amen on on your new body and eternal life so you see it's not it's not the end result it's just the deposit amen so through redemption i want you i'm going to get some some some things nailed down here for you now through redemption your body now belongs to god and it is his temple your body does not belong to satan your body is god's body to dwell in and to operate through amen first corinthians 6 19 do you not know your body is a temple of the holy spirit who is in you whom you've received from god you're not your own you have been bought for with a price therefore glorify god with your body now what was he telling him in that verse he was telling don't yield yourself to sin and unbelief and fornication and so on don't yield your body to sin but he's making it clear your body is the temple of the holy ghost who that that is in you that you receive from god and you're not your own you're bought with a price i'm just reminding god right now god this is your body amen it's your body satan has no right to squat in it he has no claim on this body it is not his body amen my hands are not yielded to the devil's work and man i no longer yield my members to sin that's romans 6. amen but i yield them to god and my my voice is to praise him amen is not to murmur and complain it is to praise him and my voice is to speak the word not the devil's lies amen my mind is for god to occupy not for the devil to occupy come on my body is for health to radiant not for sickness to reign in amen the bible said in first corinthians 3 16 do you not know that your selves are god's temple and that the god spirit dwells in you you see satan is not the original owner of your body he's not the original owner of the earth amen he is not the creator of our bodies but he is its perverter and we are in a fallen condition so we are not in our original immortal condition now in this fallen condition we get attacked with demonic sicknesses over and over again until we die why because from dust our heart to dust thou shalt return our bodies still grow thorns and thistles disease and afflictions you know why should i as a child of god have this it ain't because you're a child of god it's because of the fall and because it is in perverted form then satan comes with buffett after buffett warned after war until finally your purpose is fulfilled in life and you depart from this into where there is no war but however because of the atonement i'm going to get something here because of the atonement the word of faith will rebuild tissue in your body that these disease these demons have torn down amen now our combat is not with the physical things but with spiritual things our enemies are spirits they're not flesh and blood they are spirits the diseases that afflict man are spiritual amen we have been given power through the name of jesus to cast them out through the name not because it has magic powers but because that name represents the atonement for the payment for our redemption and jesus triumph over death hell and the grave so we use that name saying satan you got to back off because jesus paid for this it gives us title to every promise now diseases are demon spirits who like their master seeks satan six bodies to do harm in they come to dwell in order to do harm they're like a thief they come to rob and to kill and destroy and all all bodies whether you're christians or not where they are vulnerable to satan's invasion because of the fall amount now these demons these dark shadows we spoke about them last sunday which you know with them sinners they use their bodies to do their dirty work you know you once done satan's dirty work you were once sometimes darkness is that right your way that you live was according to the prince of the power of atmosphere that one that ruled the atmosphere of your body of your life and you you you went and yielded your members to sin to do wrong amen remember when jesus comes in you yield it to him that's why these hands raise up and praise god that's why this mouth declares his word is the truth amen that's why this body now obeys the word of god rather than the law of sin are you with me but you know satan then will use um will use these as you know these centered they're they're like missionaries who do his dirty work they use their power to defile to destroy to abuse others um they satan use these defiled ones like i said as as a missionary to defile other innocent people and now that's the influence of sinners they spread their darkness through their words through their behavior through their dress through their deeds they spread their darkness but god also uses human instruments a man anointed and filled by the holy ghost to bless to inspire to encourage others who need god's help [Applause] amen once i was satan's missionary i was his embassary but now i am god's ambassador and we are ambassadors for christ i represent him i represent a different kingdom amen and i'm here to bless to inspire to encourage everyone amen that you can be an overcomer you can rise out of the realm you are there is a higher place for you to swap but you know with all the demons and all of their ugliness and all of their filthiness and all their their scariness they're not to be feared the weakest somebody say weakest the weakest of christian can use god's word to cast them out [Applause] you got more authority in heaven than any angel even those that didn't fall so you certainly have authority over satanic spirits and the weakest of christian that's why that's why let the wheat say i'm strong why because the weak as a christian can use god's word to cast satan out and when people fear they are demons because they don't understand their own position they've never heard or don't realize about their legal defeat by jesus christ that at calvary every devil was defeated legally satan has no more right to you is that right amen well in fact of the matter the taking of the book of title that we was talking about the opening of his seals is the triumph of the bloody lamb who opens us all the possibilities within the book so we need not live below our privileges the ownership of our inheritance has never been more sure amen now satan brings his darkness he brings his atmospheres you notice with sickness comes an atmosphere with sickness comes a tormenting spirit amen that you know i've often said you know i can take i can take anybody any child anybody and i can put my finger on a wart and command that wart to leave and with two or three weeks you know it'll be gone and man i remember i think it was esther you know one one time when she was a young girl you know she she had one of those on her on her finger had a ward on her finger and i said i said wait a minute let me just put my my finger on that thing i said i curse it in the name of the lord about three weeks later she told me he said daddy that thing's still here i said esther i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you one more time i cursed that thing in the lord now don't you look at it don't you worry about it you don't pay it no attention and in three weeks it'll be gone three weeks later the thing was gone now listen that is a life that builds a little tumor or little swelling little body for it to live in now medically you would go and take an acid or something or get them to burn it off you know with that by the way you know uh doctors do that remember when when um in that great move of god we had little jed i think four or five years old at the time maybe three four years old had over over a hundred warts on his little body and and and they the doctor had burned like a nearly uh nearly 100 off and there was still hundreds more and he said there's so many i can't burn them off at one time it'll just cause too much distress on the child so what we'll do is you come back for another treatment see brother mother brought him through the prayer line that night and we prayed for that child amen cursed the thing in the name of the lord and the next you know right in the next few days every wart was gone totally gone why because the name of jesus takes preeminence the power of god takes preeminence over every spirit now that ward has no more power than a cancer it also is a growth it gets in the body but you know with it comes a spirit of fear there's no fear with war if i have it if i live with it you know if i die with it you know and when i die i still got it it's it's not gonna matter i it's just a wart it's a ugly it's unsightly it kind of gets bumped once away but it's no big deal but then you look at cancer and cancer comes along and it had got no more power than the wart all devils are powerless before the name of jesus whether a wart or a cancer but with that cancer comes another spirit that's a spirit of fear that begins to work and is always hounding at your ear it's going to take your life it's going to destroy you look how it makes you feel and you get down in the sense about knowledge and what you ought to do is ignore the thing and walk on god said i'm healed i'm not going to look at the symptoms no more i'm looking to a divine promise keeping my mind on the divine promise i can only have peace when my mind has stayed on him now see but you see he is the prince of the power of air that's again a heavenly atmosphere he is has power over heaven over over the air prince of power the air a heavenly realm and satan brother branham said is always near to get something fumbled up in your mind even brother branham would would have trouble with that because satan would be there every time he was in discernment and he said you know in one prayer line he said and there comes there comes a a thought from another realm and he said it's not from god you only guessed that but i'm going to prove to you satan i didn't guess that and he goes on one more time after over and over and over and over until the woman's faith is raised and she's healed amen now because because satan is always there to get something fumbled up in your mind even in the service like this morning he's right there to fumble something up in your mind he's there to get you distracted get you pulled off get your wander get your get your fear and get you down get you questioning rather than believing he's always stirring up the atmospheres as the prince of the power of the air he is called he's always trying to cause you to disbelieve and lose faith you see when you lose faith you've disbelieved the word your weapon that's your weapon right and you're dishonored without the word none of us can stand against the devil amen faith is the hand that holds the sword of the word of god now look in the sword it's sharp it can cut it can cut through the darkness and say the most wretched center like we heard brother wendell's testimony wins tonight wasn't that wonderful the most wretched couple of heron and addicts and and horrible conditions come on amen but the the sword the sword can cut all the way through the darkness to bring someone like that salvation amen amen it can bring healing to well i don't care how desperate it is i mean how bad the situation was how bad the cancer was and how awful the symptoms and the what you know the word of god can cut a hole all the way through there bring the light of god's glory hey man destroy that thing are you with me amen but faith is the hand that holds the sword so it is no more the word of god is no more effective than your faith so a weak hand can only cut just a little hole no matter how cold how sharp the sword is oh it's subdued kingdoms it overcome fires it delivered them from prisons come on faith faith gave abraham a child after she was barren for he was let's say we're two young people amen faith faith will do a mighty thing but there's got to be a strong hand of faith the word of god is powerful amen but the sword it is only as powerful as the hand that holds the sword and the hand is faith now so he's always trying to get you to disbelieve and and weaken your arm of faith he can't weaken the word so he weakens your faith so his attack is against the your faith in the promise now so faith is the hand that holds the sword the word of god a weak hand can cut a hole through the darkness amen and satan will come and attack your faith because he knows without faith you can't please god he knows your doubt pushes god away now the the battles in the heavens michael i mean gabriel's trying to get to you tell you you're greatly loved and here's the revelation for your need amen but here's this war that is happening back and forth in the heavenly and daniel must not give up because if he gives up the battle is lost now there's where sight and time is god's worst enemy in divine healing somebody say that with me sight and time god's worst enemies sight is not faith huh faith don't need sight faith is the evidence of what you are hoping for you don't need sight to give you evidence you need faith to give you evidence faith is the evidence of what you are believing for or hoping for now so sight is not faith is an enemy to faith but faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things we can't see now like brother wendell said wednesday night faith don't look at a calendar or a watch it looks at the word and the word is eternal so it's not looking at time it's not looking at the calendar well we've been praying we've been believing for so many days no you're not looking at time you're looking at the promise well it's we've waited too long you know no we're not we've not waited too long we're not looking at time we're looking at the promise well but things don't aren't any different than they were yesterday but we're not looking by sight we are looking at what the word said and the word said the mountain's moving even if i can't tell it with my sight [Applause] now the second miracle brother branham said as i told you before many times in time in sight issue is the worst enemies god has time and sight you look and neither one of them declares anything about god you want it done spontaneously when god takes his time about things let's just believe whatever's said is that right because you believe what you s but but the reason is the enemy because you believe what you see rather than look at the unseen where the battle's being fought so you know you're looking here and you're seeing your problem but you're not looking at the unseen and you see them there all of heaven is doing everything to get to you there's a war going on and all of heaven is moving on your behalf don't give up on it don't quit and surrender and then press on i mean when the when the tough you know when the going gets tough the tough gets going you press back harder i mean you hang on to that promise everybody you you look here you know and you see this final you looking boy here timothy stand up timothy hey man this specimen of arts ain't he you look over here and you see you know he's got a black shirt on he doesn't he's got a black shirt on that's a black shirt what color you think it is brother brother tommy what do you think it is it's yellow you see your sight tells you that's yellow i can't convince you that it's black because that's a yellow shirt now faith looks at the promise thank you faith looks at the promise and you believe you know your you know what god's word said amen and you believe it just as firmly as you believe that shirt's a yellow search why your sight tells you it's yellow somebody else says blue is black it's purple it's this it's that is the other and you say no it's yellow it's yellow it's yellow it's yellow why because your sight tells you so and when your faith anchors in the word of god the doctor says this my medicine did that the problem said that remember he says this somebody else died with that your blood your word said amen your sight of faith amen your faith sin says god's word is true and you can't convince me that is black [Applause] now faith is a substance of things hoped for faith is the evidence of things you don't see take smell or hear it's another sense it's in another realm you don't fight this battle with census you fight this battle with faith now so you know you know just like brother elle said well if you say it's black i'll say it's black that's what we do with the doctor that's what we say with the skeptics well you see it's black man the world all says it's black and everybody else is saying is black must be black i must be wrong but you see faith has got to anchor in the word of god and the word is right i've seen what the word said therefore i will not believe the lie of the devil when the devil tells me something contrary against the word of god i don't care what my sight says my feeling says my hearing says the word said i am healed hallelujah the word said i'm leading this battle the word said i'm an overcomer the word said hallelujah what did the word say i don't care if the preacher says some shirt is black i don't care if they say these are miracles or past i don't care if they deny every promise of the word you're gonna say that shirt is yellow [Applause] i'm not going to believe what anybody circumstances anything else what my sight says my hearing says what the doctor said what science says i'm going to believe what the word said because faith is a sense that looks out only in god's word and it says god's word is true [Applause] hallelujah now you can't have anything from god only by faith by faith the walls of jericho fell down come on who would have thought a shout would bring the walls down amen but faith brought it down by faith moses refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter by faith gideon there took his promise with 300 men he with the he whipped the midianites without faith it is impossible to please god and if you want to please him you must come to him with faith believing his word is true now if you're doctors you're absolute you'll take what the doctor said if the preacher say absolute you'll take what he said but you've got to take the word as you're absolute now brother branham said about that in leading of the spirit he said the little lady sitting right there second one from the back there she's bothered with nervousness and that right lady see what i mean that demon knows that demon knows if that woman will halfway believe oh god amen we'll have halfway believe that jesus christ the son of god and i'm his prophet that'll have to leave her and that demon is calling to that one for help to help for help to accumulate unbelief but he's lost the battle he sure had because faith is gathering hallelujah amen come on now there's only one thing that's going to happen with the attack of the devil we're not getting weaker we're getting stronger [Applause] now what would satan do when he was exposed those demons of cancer arthritis other kinds it would scream and how and calling other demons to congregate and create an atmosphere of unbelief because satan is a prince of atmospheres you see brother branham said in the future home all the sin that's in the heavens above he is the prince of the power of the air he keeps off or wars off the blessings from god so there he is you know controlling atmospheres and he's trying to keep you from the blessings amen in there comes thunderbolts of lightning and strike the earth amen amen now don't let that bother you brother l you're going to be going all the way back to the doctor again and what are you going to do you're going to say what the word said because you're going to believe what god's word said not what the doctor says right amen amen so don't let that discourage you you know you answered just exactly according to the plan of god predestinated for this sermon this morning smile and be glad god used his part of the sermon amen so just in the natural the atmosphere is stirred up until there comes sheets of slicing rain and violet winds and typhoons and storms and even so satan disrupts the atmospheres in your life and mine that's what he's been trying to do to me do you know disrupt the atmosphere i'll be down and depressed and oh memory you know somebody else went through this and it didn't have a good outcome in this and all the other yeah and the yak of the devil he gets in your ear how many has had him in your ear this week i'm glad you know it was the devil amen because that is half of the victory right there it just know who's talking [Applause] amen there's another voice that is said from the word i am a son of god i have been commissioned i have been called i've been elected and i have placed for this hour and this time that's the reason i'm here it comes with storms slices of rain thunder real noise satan is there sitting in the seat of authority where man what set controlling the atmosphere is the earth once well man adam would once bring peace upon the earth satan is there stirring up war strife afflicting man as a tormentor with storms and lightning famine and disease satan then brings his wars down to the earth causing disruption in the cells of your body and you're you know there starts a war in your body i mean those of you that are are dealing with afflictions today there's a war going on amen you know in the cells of your body that war starts in your body as a cancer or other disease or sickness and it begins to conquer and destroy he's a thief he comes to rob and to kill and destroy now brother branham said it was a backswing cell that cancer gets into unfortunately the older we get the more backsliders we have amen in our body ourselves go to backsliding on us they ain't going forward i ain't getting younger i ain't prettier well i never was but handsomer wasn't much of that either but nevertheless you know it's starts going down i won't talk about you this time brother kenny didn't come so i could talk about him give him my apologies amen god bless you brother kenny you're going to be young again one day amen but even now even now we can have divine healing even now arthritic spirits should be cast out even now god can create and re recreate spines and bring things back even now we don't have to wait for a resurrection we can have it now [Applause] hallelujah so he said now let's just diagnose it for a moment he said now let's have let's bring you down one cell after the other one cell after the other and finally you get down to one little germ in other words he's pushed back all the cells and you finally come back to one little germ and what is that germ he said i break down that germ down now find out germa is a teeny little cell small as celery is it it can be seen because it's a natural part but it's the last thing a light and the glass can reflect there's a teeny little cell of a germ and some of them are so small a microscope can't pick it up well then the germ is alive and if we go beyond the last cell then you got life and then comes into the spirit realm so he says go back beyond the corrupt cells and you come to find out where it started from was a germ that started multiplying and then you you break past the germ and you find there's a life in that germ did you know when brother ron spencer went for um a biopsy in his lungs do you know that the technician as he's done it he's he says you know he said i've been reaching trying to get a piece of one of those he said but they keep moving away from me he said their life and they keep dodging the needle their life that's what science is saying and he said we go back beyond the last cell then you get a life and that goes into it comes in the spirit realm and he said just as you grew in the womb of your mother a cancer grows in your body and he said what caused the cancer well maybe a bruise will cause a cancer and those little cells when they're bruised now that bruise can become environmentally it can come by a chemical it could be covered by the food that you ate or some dye in there it could be anything that would corrupt the sale and and he says then that little sale when it's proven to be in the backslide gives a perfect place then for the devil to give in a backslidden cell you get a backslider in the church he's going to bruise the whole body if you don't watch but that cell backslide is bruised up he said now your doctor he can tell you about your body your anatomy but my work is in the realm of spirits so i'm not dealing with the lump that's where i live the most of my time he says is in another dimension that the world knows nothing about and he said now i can't heal nobody i never healed a person i'll never heal a person no one else did god said i'm the lord that heals all thy diseases then all hospital cases that's divine healing any healing that would come any way at all has to come from god or god told something that was wrong it's god amen well you know somebody we we claim divine healing so well somebody said well that you had some medicine well the medicine didn't heal only god is healer he said i'm the lord that heals all thy diseases i'm the only healer there is so hospitals can heal amen you know but but what do you know any healing that comes comes from god now satan is a prince of atmospheres and he gains power over you to getting you to lose faith and to disbelieve now as the prince of atmosphere his atmospheres are full of evil spirits to accuse us and tempt us and do as much evil and harm in the world as he can that's his job he's doing every bit of harm that he can he you know and there again he he he gets in this nation stirs up against strife again gets in this race drives up and cause strife against this race against the other and on and on and on and on here we go he tries to he tries to close off the heaven with veils of darkness and doubt and fear and unbelief sin and sickness now you know on a normal day sun would be shining but you know here we get all these storms that comes in and a typhoon and for our hurricane and for days the the the clouds obscure the light of the sun same thing that happens there satan comes along with his clouds of doubt and confusion you know and and tries to veil the heavens from us with veils of darkness of doubt of fear of unbelief of sin and sickness he'll use sickness and troubles to attack the mightiest preachers that god has to keep them in bondage of fear tempting them to question thus doubt god are you with me now so here's his work you know we we come along how does this why did this happen to me where did i fail the lord how come you know i've been trying my best to do did i miss my time somewhere did i do it did i i did i stay out of church did i did i fail to pray why did this happen to me i'm a servant of god why am i going through all of this you see it's war hello if your sins under the blood you're a righteous person if they're confessing on the blood i'm going to say it again you're righteous your righteousness he is righteous how could this happen to me you know and and i just want to say somebody's got to fight and not run you know somebody has to say enough is enough somebody's got to say i've been commissioned when i've done everything i can do stand and christ the mystery of god revealed which i told you i've been loading my gun with this but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand i want you to know we are predestinated just stand we are not predestinated to fall we have been predestinated to stand and if somebody's gonna stand we're gonna stand [Music] we'll stand for every divine promise amen you must overcome i mean you can't run paul said when you've done all the stands stand there for so drunk get it bloody it ain't for decoration get it bloody amen thrust it to the enemy look jesus had to overcome i want to show you your scripture in revelation chapter 3 verse 21. these are words of jesus to you you are in this h the laodicean h so well i'm not in this age well then this ain't to you just forget it and go on wherever you are up somewhere in the imagination of your own imaginations but if you're here right here under the laodicean messenger the laodicean angel amen this is your word to him that overcometh hallelujah as i've always said and i repeat it again not because i'm old and senile but because i want you to remember he couldn't say to him that overcometh unless somebody was going to overcome [Applause] that word right there prophesies you into being it speaks you into being you have been spoken to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne so now here we got it are you with me now amen said to him that overcometh will grant us it with me what in my throne even as i over again you're gonna have to overcome just like i did [Applause] there's some overcoming for you too there's things for you to face too perfect faith brother branham said he said we're trying to get the church into place we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's all what we hunger for he said it's just laying right at the door and we see it but we want to see more of it how about it evening light we've seen it but we are not just satisfied with what we've seen we will see more of it amen we want it it's such a flow it'll be a help to us and it'll flow out to others we want the whole world to know jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever his power is the same his word is the same his gifts are the same he's the same in every detail except his corporal body and and where is he at what corporal body is in now your body and mind remember jesus he said never used his power for himself he used it for others and that's what it was sent for and you think well why would a man that was so full of power like him ever would have to ever be sick you know say oh no jesus was perfect and he was a god man and he was never sick well go with me down to calvary affliction is laid on him whenever pain is laid on him i i know you know there may be some teachers that teach and say jesus jesus he was the perfect man he never got sick no jesus became sick he became a man and brother branham referred to a book that he read of the prince of the house of david he sat on a rock and grown with a headache see he bore our infirmities he said he bear means to pack him he bored he had sickness he had temptations he had troubles he had frustrations just as we have because he had to be the right kind of mediator so he had to be a partaker the husband of the fruit before he would know so he too would have to endure satan's dirty breath in hand-to-hand combat come on amen listen i'm trying to show you jesus went through things you're going to go through things too you're in a battle this is not a big nick you're not of course this is par for the course he said when trials come don't think there's some strange thing that's happened to you are things that aren't common to man when satan came to brother branham after hope and sharon rose's death he couldn't tell brother branham if there was no god he just told him god didn't love him you prayed for this and you prayed for that one and you know now where are all those miracles and here you pray for your own girl your own daughter and your own wife and they die he took a beating over it now question him how could god be merciful be a merciful god and let your wife and your little baby die you're pleading for their life don't you think satan put thoughts in his mind brother brethren said he came to me to the point i was just about to say god if that's the way you are i'm through that's how far down he reached but you know what in his own way not that he's our mediator but in his own way it made brother branham uh you know with a heart full of compassion every time from then on he looked at a cross-eyed child and god healed it every time why from what he went through so that so that god would turn that thing around and use it for his glory do you know how many times over and again i have gotten letters from about mariah and atlanta and karen and different ones that telling me you know you know because they went through this it gave me such faith in my trial now so you see satan put all of those things together come whisper there because he was trying to control his atmosphere because he controlled brother brown's atmosphere he controls him just like the weather controls your moods these storms these clouds to control your atmosphere satan's there prince of the power of atmospheres sending down his thunderbolts and lightning bolts and striking here and there and this one gets struck around in there and put in fear and doubt and confusion and unbelief even in the secular world brother you know you listen to the news and you get struck i mean it just smites your heart i mean all the killings the murders the horrible things that you know the the horrible things that are happening in the world today are you with me amen and it controls your atmospheres you you let those things affect you i just tell you brother brandon said i was driving along taking my daughter to school and he said i i turned the radio on was listening to a broadcast that was saying that creation was just the masses blowing together some phosphates and few chemicals of earth and warm sunshine created a general life and brought out life how ridiculous when sunshine will kill any germ of life lay a germ out in the sunshine and kill it immediately and and there's no such thing but satan was just trying to punch at me and after i dropped my daughter off to school he said as i was going up the street satan said to me what this same devil would appear in his room and and and look like a deformed creature and singing like a chicken going to his to the hen yard you know in a in a mocking voice and accusing him saying you're nothing but a fake and all these miracles you talk about is just a fake after seeing blind eyes open cripples walk and he's still come in his ears and he said as i was going down the street there listening to you know you know i had been listening to that and as i was going up the street after hearing this satan said to me you know this man you call jesus just like any other man in his day like a billy graham or roberts you just a man that they begin to have a few people gather around him say he's a great man and after a while he became greater and he become a god to them and now it's scattered over the world since he's dead and that's all and he said and i thought how a liar you are that's the way we ought to do it friends we hear all of this unbelief going satan how a liar you are i turned his eyes crossing graham sweet i said satan you've been you that's been talking to my conscience i'd like to ask you a few things who was that that the hebrew prophet spoke of that would come who was the anointed messiah who what was upon those men who foresaw him and told his life thousands of years before he got here who was it foretold he just a letter and when he come he was numbered with the transgressors and he was wounded for our transgression he made his grave with the rich they arise on the third day and he did and he promised the holy ghost and i've got it so you might as well get away because it's written in the word and every word is true then he left then he left get it out [Applause] satan will come let me try to close on this i got to count down in four minutes but i don't have enough time i like nart let it turn red then it'll run out after about 10 minutes and i won't have no more time it'll be eternal the great apostle paul said there came a messenger a wicked evil angel a messenger of satan to buffet me hello wake up just for a minute let's look in the unseen just for a minute amen what is that that's buffered in you what is that just laid a blow on you what just hit you upside the head what hit you what thing was that what

came with blow after bill paul said i'd get over it and my faith would rise above it here it come again hit me and i again out with him and and i'd win that battle next thing you know he'd come again he come with blow after blow these evil angels don't strike a blow with a fist demons of spirits without bodies they hit at you with worry with doubt with fear with unbelief with temptations with accusations you get healed and dodged that blow he strikes again and when he does he cloaks you with a dark hood of unbelief amen well healing didn't work because i'm sick again healing did work [Applause] amen what happened hey you know i have had people hey you can say what you want to but i i know the power of the gospel i walked into karen's eman's room one day there where she was in uh going to the hospital for a cancer surgery walked in there doctors were going to remove her whole ovaries everything on the inside the cancers in in your body all through and i walked into her hospital room and i said sister karen what do you want me to do with this devil and she said cut his head off hallelujah amen i took the word of god and with the word of faith amen went to work on

blow amen it was blow after blow you get healed you dodged that blow and it strikes again when he'd close it then he then he cloaks you with unbelief so well healing didn't work it did amen america

right thing we were bombed by japan and there we were there in the in the um there off of the off of the the island of of of uh hawaii and there them ships still lay in the bottom of that sea tombs for hundreds of soldiers and america lost that battle and even she lost other major battles but she didn't lose the war and i just tell you we might lose the battle now and then but we ain't going to

begin to pump out military things and turn factories into war factories and america went to war [Applause] [Music] and she didn't get through until she got a treaty until she dealt with the atoms there and dropped it on the bombs on hiroshima until japan said we quit and i'll tell you well friends so you know we may get here a big blow here and a big blow there but we're not gonna knock down and be defeated we're getting back on our feet we're pressing it we're taking the battle to the enemy hallelujah we're taking the war to the enemy and we shall overcome because michael and his angels
