[43:11] fruit so that you shall be my disciples
[43:15] Amen may God bless the reading of his
[43:18] word you can be seated amen
[43:21] how wonderful is God's truth
[43:23] a man we just see so many things that
[43:27] lies within the Word of God I wanted to
[43:30] just share with you that we just had a
[43:32] reprinting of the three titles that
[43:35] we've done for outreach which is one on
[43:37] the Godhead and baptism in Jesus name
[43:40] and also the five comings of Elijah
[43:43] speaking about the prophecies concerning
[43:45] Elijah in this day and also on the
[43:48] original sin if you don't understand
[43:51] what the original sin was then you you
[43:53] cannot make the connection of all the
[43:56] scriptures through the Bible and so we
[43:58] make them and I just wanted to say for
[44:01] you overseas they're available in a PDF
[44:04] that you can print them out and share
[44:06] them there they're not true at all
[44:09] replace the message they're simply for
[44:11] outreach and for you at home folks it's
[44:15] a good thing to to share with others
[44:17] amen and and of course it's a it's it's
[44:21] what I wrote it for it was outreach
[44:23] tools and I believe it'll be a blessing
[44:26] to the Bride of Christ so we just had
[44:28] those done and so we have a new new
[44:32] stock of them available for those that
[44:34] would be interested and also this
[44:38] morning you know because we're here at a
[44:42] special time and and I trust you had a
[44:45] wonderful Thanksgiving amen and gave
[44:48] thanks unto the Lord for his blessings
[44:51] upon us as you gathered with family and
[44:54] men god bless you brother Orlando sister
[44:56] Regina god bless you for being here
[44:59] today
[44:59] everybody just glad you here man if your
[45:03] visitor in our myths we're happy that
[45:04] you're here they're not visitors they're
[45:06] home folks amen so it's nice to see them
[45:09] it's like getting a good drink of water
[45:12] you know when you've been real thirsty
[45:14] so been real thirsty to see your brother
[45:16] and sister God bless you for being here
[45:18] amen but I trust you've had a wonderful
[45:20] Thanksgiving and a man and we were
[45:24] blessed as we gathered with our family
[45:28] and then had friends and extended family
[45:31] and just enjoyed a day of togetherness
[45:33] and Thanksgiving and to our Lord for his
[45:36] good
[45:37] I trust you did the same and as yes that
[45:41] God would bless you you know in a great
[45:44] way in your family I you know I thought
[45:48] about it you know there's been many many
[45:50] Thanksgivings I can remember as a boy
[45:52] going to brother branham's meetings in
[45:55] Shreveport when he was there at live
[45:58] tabernacle for the Thanksgiving meetings
[46:02] in 63 and then again in 65 and and those
[46:06] were special days and God was telling us
[46:09] things you know for example that there
[46:11] was a bride that was being United with
[46:14] Christ and he would speak that message
[46:17] on the invincible union and then of
[46:20] course works his faith expressed and
[46:23] trying to do God a service and and then
[46:26] the the other and on the wings of us no
[46:28] I dove and those mighty messages that
[46:31] were preached as God was imparting some
[46:34] things to us as the the Prophet was
[46:38] bringing the final messages that he
[46:42] would preach here upon the earth and so
[46:45] you know it's a it's a time of
[46:47] remembrance and I think our nation
[46:51] started this tradition back in George
[46:55] Washington's day where that they you
[46:58] know signed into a in order to for the
[47:02] nation to stop and remember God's
[47:05] blessings upon us and the provisions
[47:08] that he made and given us a new country
[47:10] and and as I reflected upon data I
[47:14] shared some thoughts with our deacons
[47:17] here and minister friends also that I
[47:21] have and I just want to kind of share
[47:23] them with you this morning as I preface
[47:26] some of the things that I'm going to
[47:28] speak on because I think it also
[47:31] reflects the the future that we have as
[47:35] the Bride of Christ and I and I just
[47:38] said your brother says one of the many
[47:41] who trace their heritage back to the
[47:44] pilgrims fathers and so that's
[47:46] identified with him there I want to
[47:48] express my
[47:50] it's given to our great God and Savior
[47:52] for bringing us to this lamb because in
[47:56] this day God sent a message to us here
[47:59] we know it came here in America I think
[48:01] it was a sovereign thing of God he could
[48:05] have chosen you know a little bitty
[48:07] country somewhere without the means to
[48:10] spread it around the world but he chose
[48:12] it right here in the West at least at
[48:15] the setting of the Sun as the message
[48:18] reaches its climax said before it goes
[48:21] back to the east and so God sent a
[48:24] message to us which is brought freedom
[48:26] to many thousands around the world and
[48:30] we have been saved from the slave belt
[48:32] of sin and the tyranny of false
[48:34] religions that oppressed us and today as
[48:38] we pause to give thanks I'm thankful for
[48:40] you my fellow comrades who fight bravely
[48:44] in this battle for freedom you bless me
[48:47] with your passion for truth we have
[48:50] conquered much and for that I'm thankful
[48:53] but yet there's more today I want to
[48:56] thank you for your labors in the Lord
[48:58] and for a church that has been
[49:01] established but surely we have not
[49:03] possessed at all
[49:05] are we not like Israel who has conquered
[49:08] much and has one of the finest military
[49:10] forces in the world yet within sight but
[49:13] just out of our grasp
[49:15] lies the Temple Mount in Hebron where
[49:18] the tombs of Abraham and Sarah lay and
[49:22] both there of these places even today
[49:25] remain in the hands of hostile strangers
[49:28] and the same is true for us a
[49:32] resurrection and a rapture still lays
[49:34] before us it is this ground were
[49:38] patriarchs of the faith were laid as a
[49:41] seed and they still await our arrival
[49:44] for without us they cannot be made
[49:47] perfect it must be conquered it must be
[49:51] our possession surely it is now that
[49:54] sons of God will be manifested and shall
[49:57] rise to the occasion for the final
[49:59] battle from mortal to immortality
[50:02] so brothers and sisters while we pause
[50:05] to give thanks for a restored word for
[50:09] an unsealed book for the Gospel of st.
[50:12] Paul
[50:13] let us continue the book of Acts going
[50:16] from glory to glory and from victory to
[50:19] victory until every hill and valley of
[50:22] this great land the prayer of this
[50:24] promised word is free from enemies and
[50:27] we step from everything mortal into
[50:29] immortality but when this battle is over
[50:32] it is then we were where the crime I
[50:34] feel that we have so much more to
[50:37] accomplish and I'm totally dissatisfied
[50:39] for where we are at this time surely
[50:43] someone must break the cycle
[50:45] surely God wants to do more than in past
[50:49] ages in past ages Luther broke from the
[50:53] land of bondage into the glorious
[50:55] freedom of the just shall live by faith
[50:57] it was a glorious revelation many broke
[51:01] free with him and shouted and glorified
[51:04] God for this newfound freedom from the
[51:07] tyranny of Rome these broke out into
[51:11] little groups and homes and shammies and
[51:13] eventually with new buildings dedicated
[51:16] to the preaching of that revelation new
[51:19] signs were put over the doors of other
[51:22] were put over many other doors
[51:25] identifying himself with Luther's
[51:28] revelation and soon they settled down in
[51:31] Lutheran churches content with the
[51:34] portion of truth that was revealed and
[51:37] gradually they became as dead as the
[51:39] Catholics with a little different
[51:42] philosophy the same repeated with the
[51:45] Methodists and later the Azusa movement
[51:48] and we have now accomplished what the
[51:51] Lutheran's and Methodists and de souza
[51:53] movement have done we have our own
[51:56] buildings that with names that identify
[51:59] us with a message some of these are nice
[52:03] and buildings and the denominations were
[52:05] left but sadly far too more far too many
[52:09] have a name that they are living but
[52:12] they're dead
[52:13] and while I'm thankful for a place where
[52:15] the word can be fully preached I am far
[52:18] from satisfied surely God wants more
[52:22] than new buildings where different
[52:24] philosophy is preached my prayer is God
[52:27] don't let that be our plight please
[52:31] don't let us be a repeat of the cycle of
[52:34] revival and death so all were to the
[52:37] prize before us there must be another
[52:40] book of Acts written and novel just one
[52:43] of his failures and wars over doctrines
[52:46] and persecutions but a book of Acts
[52:49] continued where and where the Apostle
[52:52] and not a place where the Apostle
[52:55] phunkfist aaalac fathers aimed at and
[52:58] relaxed we must not this must not be
[53:02] just a repeat of the book of Acts but a
[53:05] continuation of the same outpouring of
[53:08] the same Holy Spirit that wrote a book
[53:11] of Acts no don't dismiss don't mistake
[53:15] this for utterances of discouragement
[53:18] but rather I am encouraged that there
[53:22] are some who will break this cycle of
[53:24] revival and death and return to the
[53:27] power of Pentecost to welcome back the
[53:30] Lord Jesus Christ yes I believe he will
[53:34] find faith when he returns Sharon from
[53:38] the Ephesian Church age he that hath an
[53:40] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[53:43] unto the churches how tragic it is that
[53:46] this first age did not listen to the
[53:48] spirit it's but instead listen to man
[53:51] but thank God in the last days there
[53:55] will be a group rise up the true bride
[53:58] of this last day and she will listen to
[54:01] the spirit and in that day of gross
[54:04] darkness the light will return by the
[54:07] pure word and we will return to the
[54:10] power of Pentecost to welcome back the
[54:13] Lord Jesus Christ what a promise that is
[54:17] today it's a promise that I hold dear as
[54:21] we are getting ready for the service
[54:24] today I'm going to be speaking to you
[54:26] taking possession of your promised as we
[54:30] have read from numbers 33 and 53 and
[54:33] prior services I'll bring it to your
[54:35] attention again and ye shall
[54:37] dispossessed then inhabitants of the
[54:39] land and dwell Darrien for I have given
[54:43] you the land to possess it and of course
[54:47] we know that this land brother branham
[54:49] said is not the Millennium because he
[54:53] says I'm the Millennium there won't be
[54:56] any wars to have to possess it but he
[55:00] said it's the land of the Holy Ghost and
[55:04] he said just like Israel was given a
[55:08] land when they left Egypt go to this
[55:10] promised land they found out it was
[55:12] already inhabited there had been other
[55:15] nations that had dwelt there before and
[55:18] since Abraham's time and taken
[55:20] possession of it and so they would have
[55:23] to actually go and overthrow and
[55:26] dispossessed a land that was already
[55:29] occupied and and in doing so there would
[55:33] be the hammerites and the Hittites and
[55:35] the highlights and Jebusites and all of
[55:37] these and they were instructed to not
[55:40] make a treaty with them but to totally
[55:44] dispossessed them and to cast them out
[55:48] and to take their possession of course
[55:51] this discouraged the heart of Israel
[55:54] because they just wanted a land that was
[55:57] just handed over to them they wanted it
[56:00] to be a land that was empty and and
[56:03] nobody was there and the and they could
[56:06] just go in and take it but they had to
[56:09] soon realize that they would have to
[56:11] fight for every square inch and they
[56:15] would have to dispossessed the enemy
[56:18] that was there and in doing so it would
[56:22] be it would come with great difficulties
[56:24] it would come with great tests of faith
[56:26] it would come at the time where the
[56:29] enemy would whisper to them but you know
[56:32] from the walls of Jericho you look like
[56:34] a grasshopper in their sight and
[56:36] you know it would be a time word that
[56:40] they would um they would be severely
[56:42] tested to the point and then and then
[56:45] they would get even satisfied with the
[56:47] little portion that to God and it would
[56:50] finally be wrote in the book of Judges
[56:52] and neither did not till I inherit it
[56:55] all and dispossessed all their enemies
[56:57] but the the amorite still remained in
[57:00] their land and neither did and neither
[57:02] did and neither did and it would it
[57:05] would list all of these that that here
[57:07] they come and they got a portion but
[57:10] they didn't get it all and I don't know
[57:13] how you feel this morning but I I am NOT
[57:17] interested in just a partial promise a
[57:20] man but I want to see a people coming to
[57:23] their full inheritance and take complete
[57:26] possession of their promised land and
[57:29] when we see the Land of Israel and her
[57:33] restoration back to her ancient homeland
[57:36] and we can justified today a miracle
[57:39] after miracle after miracle during their
[57:42] wars for independence of wars in the Yom
[57:46] Kippur War or or whatever it was where
[57:49] were that they were where they were
[57:52] going to be over round by the enemy but
[57:55] siege a hope of God come down in a
[57:59] miraculous way and give them victories
[58:02] that that was astonishing to the world
[58:05] that it could even happen when they were
[58:07] far outnumbered where they were where
[58:11] they were outgunned outnumbered and
[58:14] everything else but that had God on
[58:16] their side they had prophecy on their
[58:19] side
[58:20] and I want to say to you we have
[58:22] prophecy on our side we have a we have a
[58:25] God on their side a man all of heaven
[58:29] stands behind the possession of this
[58:33] promised land and the Word of God has
[58:36] been given to a people in this last day
[58:40] excuse me
[58:41] but now but as I said they even fall
[58:46] under the promise of God even the word
[58:49] that said in Joel I will restore saith
[58:53] the Lord that was that was given Israel
[58:56] as a people as a nation but is also
[59:00] given the spiritual Israel
[59:02] we mostly preach it of what it belongs
[59:05] to us and our restoration but you can
[59:07] also see the same God that said I will
[59:10] restore for this bride has also said it
[59:14] for Israel a man I will restore saith
[59:17] the Lord
[59:18] and against all odds and man against
[59:22] every opposition against me and
[59:25] outnumbered a man yet the Word of God
[59:29] was far then prophecy was far them God
[59:33] was on their side he was there and ever
[59:37] battled and I want you to know as we
[59:39] sing the song he's got it all under
[59:42] control he's daring every back
[59:46] a manager there never chest peach there
[59:49] never trial a man and he will
[59:52] dispossessed the enemy but it's gonna
[59:54] use you to do it and this is what Israel
[59:57] didn't realize it would be God that
[1:00:00] would dispossessed the enemy but he was
[1:00:03] gonna use Israel to do it and it would
[1:00:06] be my might and it would not be my max
[1:00:08] power but it would be by God's Spirit
[1:00:11] and this is how he would dispossessed
[1:00:14] the enemy a man and I just want to say
[1:00:17] today when I realized hey yeah how much
[1:00:20] we have but yet how much more we need to
[1:00:23] take and then then I saved it Weiss if
[1:00:26] we hear item there's more of God's
[1:00:28] promises to be possessed
[1:00:30] I can hear brother madam say about his
[1:00:33] church he said I want you all fully in
[1:00:36] through the Holy Ghost I want you to
[1:00:38] fully into this land don't stay behind
[1:00:42] he said you know you you come out you
[1:00:44] crossed and some of you have been
[1:00:45] justified by faith and you believed on
[1:00:48] the Lord Jesus Christ but you belong
[1:00:51] across the river a man in some of you
[1:00:54] have had sanctification and the works of
[1:00:57] sanctification he can point back to the
[1:00:59] pilgrim holiness in the Nazarene and
[1:01:01] whatever he said but but he said I'm
[1:01:03] saying that there's somebody gotta cross
[1:01:05] over and I'm saying the same thing this
[1:01:09] morning that must be a people that cross
[1:01:11] over into the full promise time and
[1:01:16] Jericho being sealed up and the seals
[1:01:18] being opened and the walls coming down
[1:01:21] it just means that the whole land is
[1:01:23] open it don't mean less it means more
[1:01:28] man it doesn't mean we stop it Jericho
[1:01:31] where the seals were open it means that
[1:01:33] because it's that's open and the key now
[1:01:37] to the rest of the land is given to you
[1:01:39] because when you realize who you're with
[1:01:44] the title deed in your hand with the
[1:02:04] word and brother branham would say but
[1:02:10] to you who believe oh god do you who
[1:02:14] know to you who's got something in you
[1:02:17] Collin do the deed I just wonder is
[1:02:20] there anybody today got something
[1:02:22] calling to the Deeb he learned of all
[1:02:26] the deep in you has been satisfied to
[1:02:29] stay where you are for me and my house
[1:02:33] [Applause]
[1:02:35] for me there's something more than what
[1:02:38] he sees there's a land beyond the river
[1:02:41] somewhere there's still that be calling
[1:02:44] to the deep and he says I cannot be
[1:02:47] satisfied with theology I cannot be
[1:02:51] satisfied with a good church I cannot be
[1:02:55] satisfied with a good compare campaign I
[1:02:57] cannot be satisfied with a little
[1:02:59] healing service there's something beyond
[1:03:03] that that's calling I believe I'm
[1:03:09] talking to people who are called
[1:03:15] called to the finish line now you know
[1:03:21] it's great that we have the word is
[1:03:25] wonderful to understand doctor and we
[1:03:29] often hear preach the word to word the
[1:03:31] word and certainly we must have it and I
[1:03:34] believe we have received it but I want
[1:03:38] to say but what good is it in book form
[1:03:40] or what good is it in just a sermon form
[1:03:44] what value isn't having the theology
[1:03:47] perfect if it don't live a man even
[1:03:52] brother Branham spoke against putting
[1:03:54] too much of the stress on the mechanics
[1:03:57] which he called the word and nothing on
[1:04:00] the dynamics which he said the spirit
[1:04:02] and that that pretty much describes the
[1:04:05] failure of thousands of churches today
[1:04:11] 1st Thessalonians 1 and verse 5 I'm just
[1:04:15] going to share a few scriptures with you
[1:04:17] about how the word originally came he
[1:04:21] says for our gospel came not unto you in
[1:04:23] word only but also in power and in the
[1:04:27] Holy Ghost and in much assurance as you
[1:04:30] know what matter of man we were among
[1:04:32] you for your sake so here he would hear
[1:04:36] he would speak of these very things it
[1:04:38] didn't come to you in word only but also
[1:04:41] in power and in demonstration he would
[1:04:45] say in first Corinthians 4:20 for the
[1:04:48] kingdom of God is not in word but in
[1:04:52] power and in mark 16:20 and they went
[1:04:56] forth and preached everywhere the Lord
[1:04:59] working with them confirming the word
[1:05:01] with signs following a man Hebrews 2 and
[1:05:06] 4 God also bearing them witness both
[1:05:09] with signs and wonders and with their
[1:05:11] divers miracles and gifts of the Holy
[1:05:14] Ghost according to his own will god
[1:05:16] bearing them witness
[1:05:18] a man would say in Romans 15 and 19 for
[1:05:23] he says through mighty signs and wonders
[1:05:26] by the power of the Spirit I have fully
[1:05:28] preached the gospel of Christ and the
[1:05:32] gospel of Christ is not fully preached
[1:05:34] unless it's with mighty signs and
[1:05:36] wonders a man the word wasn't preached
[1:05:40] as a dead letter but also empower in the
[1:05:43] Holy Ghost and much assurance a man in
[1:05:47] acts 14 in verse 38 they gave testimony
[1:05:50] unto the word of His grace and granted
[1:05:54] signs and wonders to be done by their
[1:05:57] hands it was God given testimony verse
[1:06:01] verse 4 of 1st Corinthians 2 and my
[1:06:06] speech and my preaching was not with
[1:06:08] enticing words of man's wisdom but in
[1:06:12] the demonstration and of power that your
[1:06:16] fates are not rest in the wisdom of men
[1:06:19] but in the power of God verse 11 of
[1:06:24] chapter 19 of Acts and God wrought
[1:06:27] special miracles by the hands of Paul so
[1:06:31] that from his body were brought unto the
[1:06:33] sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the
[1:06:36] diseases departed from them and evil
[1:06:39] spirits went out of them so now we know
[1:06:43] then how the word comes and what follows
[1:06:47] the word amen now we don't follow signs
[1:06:52] we follow the word and then those the
[1:06:54] signs follow the word for the Bible said
[1:06:57] the signs shall follow them that believe
[1:07:01] amen so if it's the word it Muslim we
[1:07:07] can talk about it all we want to we can
[1:07:10] dissect it all we want to we can and we
[1:07:14] can break it down and use our Greek
[1:07:16] words and and bring out through some
[1:07:19] policy mouth shooter but if it only
[1:07:22] what good is it a man is gonna live it's
[1:07:28] gonna live in your life it's gonna live
[1:07:31] in my life my mother's gonna live in the
[1:07:34] church it's gonna live with power
[1:07:38] hey man a power to live and overcome in
[1:07:42] life a power to stand true in them our
[1:07:45] trials and temptation power to heal our
[1:07:50] sick a man to save the loss to feel with
[1:07:54] the Holy Ghost a power not his word only
[1:08:01] now if it's the word that we're
[1:08:06] preaching and signs must follow the word
[1:08:10] the disciples what we're not told well
[1:08:13] Jesus had signs in his ministry so
[1:08:16] you're not required to know that's not
[1:08:18] what Jesus told them he told them his
[1:08:21] last words to them he said these signs
[1:08:23] are going to follow them that believe
[1:08:25] the same signs that I had you're going
[1:08:28] to have the works that I do you're going
[1:08:31] to do them all so these were the words
[1:08:34] of Jesus his last words that he would
[1:08:37] give to the church signs must follow
[1:08:40] them that believe by man and so signs
[1:08:45] must not just follow the word when Jesus
[1:08:48] preached it though
[1:08:49] signs must follow the word when we
[1:08:51] preach it man signs follow self follow
[1:08:56] believers and Jesus said that is the
[1:08:59] identity of the church the activity of
[1:09:05] the believers signs will follow them
[1:09:08] I am out now brother branham wood it was
[1:09:12] seven perfect faith and we'll just share
[1:09:14] this quote with you here he said now the
[1:09:17] identification of a scripture scripture
[1:09:20] Christian these words and Jesus these
[1:09:23] signs shall follow them that believe now
[1:09:28] how can you call yourself a believer of
[1:09:30] people and deny those words how can you
[1:09:34] call yourself a believer and deny any of
[1:09:36] this work see you can't do it you're not
[1:09:39] a believer therefore signs can't follow
[1:09:42] because you just accept what you want to
[1:09:45] believe and let the rest of it you want
[1:09:47] don't believe it but you've got to take
[1:09:50] the whole thing and believe it and when
[1:09:53] you truly believe not make believe but
[1:09:56] really believe then these signs shall
[1:09:59] follow them that be well how could you
[1:10:04] compare a Christian today with him
[1:10:06] Christians of long ago how them
[1:10:08] disciples walked in the power of the
[1:10:12] Spirit move by the Holy Ghost do it just
[1:10:15] a prisoner as I preached on the other
[1:10:17] night a prisoner to the word and will of
[1:10:20] God he couldn't even move and don't God
[1:10:22] moved him wouldn't you like to see a
[1:10:24] church rise like that it's going to it's
[1:10:28] going back it's got to come that's right
[1:10:31] it's on this road now I believe that we
[1:10:38] went down the road now we're closer now
[1:10:41] than when we first believed a man at
[1:10:44] Christ's of mystery brother Brennan said
[1:10:46] if a man says he's born again and tries
[1:10:49] to take these promises of God of Christ
[1:10:52] in this last day to some other age
[1:10:54] making him Christ yesterday or not but
[1:10:57] not today
[1:10:57] then that man or that person has been in
[1:11:00] a delusion by Satan and if that man says
[1:11:04] he believes that and it don't manifest
[1:11:05] itself through Jesus said in mark 16
[1:11:09] these signs shall follow them that
[1:11:11] believe a man into all the world and
[1:11:14] ever age
[1:11:15] I mean casting out Devils speaking with
[1:11:18] with tongues and all these great
[1:11:20] manifestations of gifts that would
[1:11:22] follow that they shall not they maybe
[1:11:25] they ought to but they will and heavens
[1:11:29] and earth will pass away but his word
[1:11:32] won't now you see Jesus what's the word
[1:11:40] but it wasn't agreed he went just a dumb
[1:11:45] he wouldn't just an ordinance of the
[1:11:48] church he was a Living Word a man and
[1:11:53] his bride will be the same she will be
[1:11:55] the Living Word of God or the Word of
[1:11:58] God alive now as the word bride the
[1:12:05] bride are the word must be in action
[1:12:08] remember the message is not a new
[1:12:11] philosophy it's a people that are Jesus
[1:12:15] Christ in action
[1:12:17] but amend my people that do the work of
[1:12:19] Christ now God has done great things in
[1:12:23] this day hey man you know you see and
[1:12:26] when we talked about it the seals
[1:12:28] weren't removed in the book though to
[1:12:31] make you a stuffed shirt with more
[1:12:34] knowledge the book was not opened to
[1:12:38] replace denominational Creed's with
[1:12:41] message Creed's but rather to open the
[1:12:44] title of inheritance so that the people
[1:12:48] would know their boundaries amen and the
[1:12:52] definitions of this promised land so we
[1:12:55] would know what is ours and the opening
[1:13:00] of the seals would expose the Antichrist
[1:13:02] who had taken away the holy spirit who
[1:13:06] had taken away the doctrines of the
[1:13:07] church and
[1:13:09] we've bought conquering and to conquer
[1:13:11] and they would undo what the Antichrist
[1:13:14] had done did you hear me a man and it
[1:13:18] would restore back not just the truth
[1:13:21] but the power of that truth
[1:13:23] a man so it wasn't given to replace
[1:13:27] replace the the the word are the
[1:13:31] philosophies of man rather it was it was
[1:13:34] given to us to to reveal what is ours
[1:13:39] what belongs to us and the removal of
[1:13:43] the seals and revealing other symbols
[1:13:45] would give us an abstract to title now
[1:13:53] we have a deed and I want to say this
[1:13:57] morning we have a deed a title that has
[1:14:01] been searched and every claim against it
[1:14:05] removed a man and it gives us a right to
[1:14:11] the full indwelling of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:14] that the full power of the blood might
[1:14:17] be made known to us the blood the power
[1:14:21] of the blood the cleansing power of the
[1:14:25] blood has so has so removed every sin
[1:14:29] stain every guilt stain all for the
[1:14:33] Church of Jesus Christ so that we can
[1:14:36] have the true baptism where we can have
[1:14:39] know the Godhead where we can know what
[1:14:42] the Apostles preached and we would come
[1:14:45] back to the original apostolic doctrine
[1:14:48] that the church is left down to the age
[1:14:51] and I want to say Oh claims that is
[1:14:54] against us has been struck off
[1:14:57] a man everything but Luther Wesley the
[1:15:01] Pentecostal anything the Catholicism all

[1:20:04] we have a deed and has been searched and
[1:20:09] every claim against you removed and it
[1:20:16] gives us the right to the full and
[1:20:19] dwelling of the holy ghost that the full
[1:20:22] power of the blood might be made known
[1:20:25] to us I under the Old Testament an
[1:20:31] illegitimate child couldn't come in or
[1:20:33] in its descendants for what was 18
[1:20:35] generations that because that blood was
[1:20:40] limited but this blood is unlimited
[1:20:47] that's because that blood didn't have
[1:20:49] enough power the blood of bulls and
[1:20:52] goats could never take a place singing
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:21:07] creature with his back all the way back
[1:21:09] to the Apostolic fathers to Jesus Christ
[1:21:12] himself and say I was bored of him and
[1:21:29] I'm not just covered by the blood as if
[1:21:32] a paint covered over my past but this
[1:21:36] was no paint this was a bleach that
[1:21:40] annihilated my past and put it back on
[1:21:45] the head of Satan himself and as
[1:21:55] wonderful as Tydeus the giving of the
[1:21:58] title does not make us a possessor of
[1:22:00] the land it only tells us what is
[1:22:05] legally ours the land will only be given
[1:22:11] to the conquer a mountain and we're in
[1:22:15] the greatest battle ever fought and

[1:35:20] Saints hallelujah I believe there's
[1:35:24] going to be tens of thousand that were
[1:35:26] raised from the dead are the seven ages
[1:35:28] Amen the Lord cometh with ten thousands
[1:35:33] of his Saints four people
[1:35:45] hey man now we may be venturing out a
[1:35:48] little bit but it is said that Enoch
[1:35:52] built a pyramid he's the one that built
[1:35:55] it they can't figure out today how how
[1:35:58] they were built but they said to Enoch
[1:36:01] built a pyramid and in his pyramid he
[1:36:06] built it without a capstone hey man
[1:36:11] that's right he built it without a gap
[1:36:13] son because he knew that the Godstone
[1:36:16] hadn't come but in the future generation
[1:36:21] there would come a completion of the
[1:36:24] church and Christ would unite with his
[1:36:28] body and take his to take a rapture in
[1:36:33] its name for pyramid was the place of
[1:36:37] sin but the Egyptians turned them
[1:36:44] into tombs hello
[1:36:50] did anybody hear that or that just kind
[1:36:53] of dropped the Egyptians turned it into
[1:36:56] twos I meant God didn't give us this
[1:36:59] place are you with me
[1:37:03] amen to become another to another
[1:37:06] Baptist tumor Methodist tumor or message
[1:37:09] Tim come on this world is not a place
[1:37:12] for a tomb
[1:37:15] this word is a place you see it was all
[1:37:28] done by faith I was hearing brother
[1:37:32] Branham preached a sermon back in the
[1:37:34] fifties the other day wonderful message
[1:37:37] and he was talking about Noah how that
[1:37:40] Noah had a word from God he was given a
[1:37:44] sort of faith and that word was given
[1:37:47] him and he said I didn't understand why
[1:37:51] in the world that God would tell him to
[1:37:53] do what he did to go and build an ark
[1:37:56] and he said this art was made out of out
[1:38:01] of something that was called gopher wood
[1:38:03] and his real porous and it is soaks up
[1:38:07] it'll just soak up the waters and soak
[1:38:09] up the liquids it was porous and would
[1:38:12] so cups and you never get an ark to vote
[1:38:15] like that and he said I wondered about
[1:38:18] it and then he said I realized that it
[1:38:22] represented poorest humanity that you
[1:38:26] were made with the place to feel and God
[1:38:29] wasn't through just a building out of
[1:38:31] gopher wood but he instructed them go
[1:38:34] get go get a I a cedar tree or pine tree
[1:38:38] or another tree and then an evergreen a
[1:38:43] man representing eternal life and cut
[1:38:47] that tree down and get the SAP out of it
[1:38:50] and take the life of that tree and put
[1:38:53] it in that porous wood
[1:38:56] with you even without and once it became
[1:39:01] filled with that pitch anyway there was
[1:39:04] nothing no storm no waters could get
[1:39:08] through are you with me
[1:39:11] I mad nothing good no torpedo no no no
[1:39:14] freaking hit against a nothin nothing
[1:39:17] could destroy nothing could a hole
[1:39:19] in it
[1:39:19] it was now as hard as steel he said
[1:39:23] that's what God did man he cut down his
[1:39:28] own eternal life tree the son of God and
[1:39:33] poured his life in the poorest humanity
[1:39:36] to give you the seal of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:38] and it's a seal on the inside and the
[1:39:42] seal on the outside the devil can't get
[1:39:44] to you he wants to
[1:39:46] [Applause]
[1:39:50] trial no tests no problem that you go
[1:39:54] through can break through that seal that
[1:39:57] evergreen lights its eternal life
[1:40:02] by faith he did it I went to that a
[1:40:09] replica they say of that Ark and all
[1:40:13] their ideas of how it could be and what
[1:40:15] the did and all the reasons trying to
[1:40:18] prove it and they had some pretty good
[1:40:21] reasoning that reasoning to all the
[1:40:25] animals you see wasn't large animals
[1:40:29] material animals they were all baby
[1:40:30] animals and so they can all fit in
[1:40:33] smaller cages and this and you know they
[1:40:35] had all of this and you know then they
[1:40:37] had a ideas of waste disposal and all of
[1:40:41] this don't explain to me I've been a
[1:40:44] farmer I've been a farmer and I can uh
[1:40:47] you know I know I I know the the the
[1:40:51] muck that is left behind just with a few
[1:40:53] animals and how much work it takes to
[1:40:56] keep that cleaned up the only brother
[1:40:58] James and then we know all about that a
[1:41:02] man that was a daily chore we had to do
[1:41:05] to keep the thing cleaned up can you
[1:41:06] imagine you know one or two of every
[1:41:09] kind of species people couldn't do it if
[1:41:14] they'd stayed up day and night yeah you
[1:41:16] know to all their figuring and
[1:41:17] everything else you have to realize
[1:41:20] there was a supernatural element
[1:41:21] somewhere
[1:41:23] that this was more than what the reason
[1:41:27] that a man can figure out the reason the
[1:41:29] man would say it wouldn't float the
[1:41:31] reason a man could say you know all of
[1:41:33] their arguments against it because
[1:41:35] that's reasoning but you see Noah didn't
[1:41:41] reason all of that he just did what God
[1:41:46] said and the supernatural God closes the
[1:41:50] door of the ark a man it took them 40
[1:41:53] days and nights through the dirty about
[1:41:56] the termal to seize them safely it will
[1:42:00] dry ground
[1:42:01] I didn't God do it out the same way he
[1:42:04] did feeding three million Jews to the
[1:42:06] wilderness and getting rock water out of
[1:42:09] a rock and bread out of heaven but man
[1:42:16] mister reason it out but no it didn't
[1:42:19] reason he just believed what God said
[1:42:22] when are we gonna learn that reasoning
[1:42:26] will get us nowhere you're just gonna
[1:42:28] have to put your faith in the world I
[1:42:30] [Applause]
[1:42:39] can't imagine I could imagine there was
[1:42:43] a lot of dishearten two days I can
[1:42:48] imagine when some would look through
[1:42:50] their website and say hey that ain't the
[1:42:52] Holy Ghost oh god don't do that anymore
[1:42:56] throw another tomato there all that
[1:42:59] person there they don't have the holy go
[1:43:01] that couldn't have been the Holy Ghost
[1:43:03] you're just an unbeliever I know what
[1:43:07] the Holy Ghost is I've tasted it I've
[1:43:10] experienced it and I know it
[1:43:13] and you can't reason me out of it I
[1:43:19] imagined it was many that started out in
[1:43:21] time to help and quit brother Brandon
[1:43:25] would say he would say that was make
[1:43:27] believers stood around the ark say well
[1:43:29] the old man could have been right and
[1:43:34] there's always those kind but you see he
[1:43:38] was going to possess his promise because
[1:43:41] it was his inheritance and reasoning
[1:43:44] wasn't going to stop him and
[1:43:45] discouragement wasn't going to stop him
[1:43:47] and he wasn't going to be satisfied come
[1:43:50] on we were just so with you with just
[1:43:53] having an ark and but no the whole word
[1:43:56] had to be fulfilled are you with me Amen
[1:43:59] all down to the agents there's been
[1:44:02] there's been men who's had to put their
[1:44:05] faith in action you see it doesn't
[1:44:09] matter how great your sword is and how
[1:44:12] it can cut and our serpent is if it
[1:44:16] remains in the scabbard it doesn't
[1:44:19] matter
[1:44:19] I'll share how sharp the sword is if you
[1:44:22] don't if you don't have the strength to
[1:44:23] use it and the phase is what holds the
[1:44:28] sword it's what presses the sword to the
[1:44:34] heart of the enemy and it depends on how
[1:44:37] strong your faith is as to how big a
[1:44:40] hole you can cut through the underneath
[1:44:44] hey man I'll tell you what brother we
[1:44:47] ought to be people of great faith oh man
[1:44:50] after seeing all that God has done in
[1:44:53] our generation to cause us to believe a
[1:44:56] man even after the miracles that he's
[1:44:59] done among us who calls us to believe we
[1:45:02] ought to be a people a great faith
[1:45:05] but really where I phase ought to be
[1:45:08] resting is not on those testimonies but
[1:45:11] upon this world of God
[1:45:13] a member told people can get sick and
[1:45:17] die remember this word never fails it's
[1:45:21] always the truth man it was true in
[1:45:25] Prior generations it'll be through and
[1:45:27] I'm generation
[1:45:28] it worked for fathers it'll work for us
[1:45:32] and God let us know it was Eve
[1:45:37] compromising on the Word of God taking
[1:45:40] reason and against the Word of God
[1:45:41] because of the fall somebody help me
[1:45:46] preach them man it was because the Word
[1:45:49] was laid aside for reason and when you
[1:45:54] go to reasoning that's when you go to
[1:45:56] get them in trouble hey man you go to
[1:46:03] reasoning that's where your faith starts
[1:46:06] dropping because you're starting to just
[1:46:09] believe God's Word and it's turning from
[1:46:11] faith to unbelief this is why the Bible
[1:46:16] said to cast down reasoning cast down
[1:46:19] imaginations you know you've got
[1:46:22] imaginations I got imaginations but you
[1:46:25] have to cast them down and then you you
[1:46:28] know my your imaginations lie how many
[1:46:31] had imaginations this week that never
[1:46:33] came to pass
[1:46:35] so your your imagination is on the
[1:46:39] bitch'll liar your reasoning will turn
[1:46:42] out to be faulty I mind there's all
[1:46:45] kinds of things your imagination your
[1:46:47] memory your memory ain't even good
[1:46:51] I mean you think you remember what
[1:46:54] happened back there and you don't even
[1:46:55] remember somebody else coming by though
[1:46:57] if did you forgot this part you left
[1:46:59] that out yeah you know why your memory
[1:47:01] is even faulty I'm every everything
[1:47:05] about your memory your imagination your
[1:47:08] conscience your reflections and your
[1:47:10] reasoning are all faulty there is only
[1:47:13] one thing that is sure and stedfast and
[1:47:15] that's a Word of God
[1:47:17] [Applause]
[1:47:39] do you ever get up to do it because this
[1:47:45] word will not be turning to him Boyd but
[1:47:47] it will accomplish what he said it to do
[1:47:50] [Applause]
[1:47:53] so if God said I paid for your healing
[1:47:56] my healings paid for he said I wanted to
[1:48:00] give you the Holy Ghost more than you
[1:48:01] want to get it I'm gonna get the Holy
[1:48:04] Ghost cause God's on my side all I have
[1:48:06] to do is agree with him hey man
[1:48:12] but you see faith is no good unless it's
[1:48:15] put into action and faith becomes
[1:48:21] atrophied and weak when is not used the
[1:48:29] Bible said that you know that our senses
[1:48:32] must be exercised to discern both good
[1:48:35] and evil
[1:48:36] so again it takes an exercising of that
[1:48:40] faith but you know it's like a guy
[1:48:43] training there you know they were
[1:48:45] lifting that weight and straining
[1:48:46] against it doesn't make him weaker
[1:48:50] that's wild that you're going through is
[1:48:52] not gonna make you weaker the trial in
[1:48:56] God knows it's gonna make you stronger
[1:49:05] understand because you went through the
[1:49:13] trial Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:49:54] hallelujah you see God's not afraid of
[1:50:02] the trial he's not afraid of the test
[1:50:06] that you go through he's not afraid at
[1:50:09] the discouragement his Satan blows your
[1:50:12] way ha he knows you're human but he
[1:50:17] knows God life flows through you
[1:50:22] that when the human only can go so far
[1:50:24] the god life takes over
[1:50:27] a man when your human faith gives out
[1:50:30] and you can't believe anymore that
[1:50:33] something takes over on the inside of
[1:50:36] you that makes you believe when you
[1:50:38] could not believe hallelujah
[1:50:43] it's an old post it's a time post that
[1:50:47] when when you want to give it up you
[1:50:49] don't give up you don't quit you keep
[1:50:53] going forward and you realize there's
[1:50:57] another battle coming greater is He that
[1:51:00] is in me that's in the world can do all
[1:51:04] things through Christ who empowers me
[1:51:20] that baptism of the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:51:24] me hallelujah Lord to God what a
[1:51:32] wonderful word but it was all through
[1:51:36] faith but faith is no good unless it's
[1:51:41] put into action you see you're not here
[1:51:51] to get awards and be put in a museum
[1:51:55] you're here for a battle pass men past
[1:52:01] ages and pass things are all in the
[1:52:04] humor in the Museum of memories of ages
[1:52:08] past these men wrought righteousness
[1:52:13] these men overcame these men the world
[1:52:17] was not worthy of and Paul would put
[1:52:21] them there in his Great Hall of Fame and
[1:52:25] show them as the great triumphs over the
[1:52:29] enemy and he would show what faith did
[1:52:34] in previous generations to let you know
[1:52:38] that your faith is the same faith but
[1:52:44] been made perfect because we are
[1:52:48] crucified with Christ yet good knew and
[1:52:52] yet we live not yet not i but the life
[1:52:55] that I now live I live
[1:52:58] by the faith of the Son of God who loved
[1:53:04] me and gave his life for me hallelujah
[1:53:07] wahoo
[1:53:08] can't lose with Christ faith in them
[1:53:12] that's what brother Branham when he was
[1:53:14] shown as he comes through the seven
[1:53:17] seals and he's given a sword in his hand
[1:53:21] and he was told this is the King's sword
[1:53:24] I want you to know that's what this
[1:53:27] message is it's the King's sword I'm not
[1:53:32] and it's not there to be put in the
[1:53:34] scabbard
[1:53:34] is not there so that we can act or go
[1:53:37] around and act smart and think we got
[1:53:39] something theologians ain't got it isn't
[1:53:43] there
[1:53:43] you know so that we can't add our own
[1:53:45] wisdom and knowledge and our
[1:53:47] understanding is give to fight the devil
[1:53:50] with the principle work of the church is
[1:53:53] the cast Satan out a man well win the
[1:53:59] enemy when the enemy came in and here
[1:54:02] they were encamped against Israel not
[1:54:04] they didn't belong there and they didn't
[1:54:09] belong in this world they were they had
[1:54:11] been God that land had been given to
[1:54:13] them listen it goes to show you
[1:54:14] something
[1:54:15] not only have you got a conquer you
[1:54:17] gotta fight to keep it hello somebody
[1:54:23] man the enemy is gonna come and try to
[1:54:26] keep that from you a man and do
[1:54:30] everything they kind of think he can to
[1:54:31] stop you that's what Shamgar found
[1:54:34] himself he was seed of Abraham he had
[1:54:37] title to the land God had given him that
[1:54:40] land he had the Word of God that's the
[1:54:42] title but he was living below his
[1:54:45] privileges and instead of being a brave
[1:54:48] man he was a coward out here a man and
[1:54:51] and and not facing the enemy and year
[1:54:55] after year it goes that way until his
[1:54:57] his his people if I could say it his
[1:55:00] churches starving
[1:55:02] and the children are pinched face and
[1:55:04] hungry and the devil is just running
[1:55:08] over them with cancers with disease with
[1:55:15] afflictions that sound familiar this is
[1:55:19] Sam God man and yet they had been given
[1:55:23] a word this is your lamb and he had been
[1:55:26] given a commission cast him out
[1:55:30] remember year after year after year he's
[1:55:32] putting up with it he would go and he
[1:55:36] would work and he would sow his seed
[1:55:38] only for the devil to come around and
[1:55:40] take away the increase and instead of
[1:55:44] the church increase in the church it's
[1:55:46] saying is falling away are you with me
[1:55:50] but you see it didn't stop there I mean
[1:55:54] one day there was an awakening
[1:55:58] hallelujah what everybody in Israel

[2:04:08] years some years ago now time gets away
[2:04:11] from me
[2:04:13] but I've been preaching on this 61 weeks
[2:04:17] 61 sermons trying to tell you about our
[2:04:20] land and I was in the Land of Israel and
[2:04:25] stood there and looked at the very place
[2:04:27] for David and Goliath fought their
[2:04:29] battle where Goliath could come running
[2:04:33] down out of a high heel you know with
[2:04:37] his massive weight his big shield his
[2:04:39] great spear his
[2:04:41] mighty sword he could come running down
[2:04:45] there and you know he was he by himself
[2:04:49] was a formidable army or adversary a
[2:04:56] mound he he by himself he comes out and
[2:05:00] makes his boast every day and we had a
[2:05:05] bunch of faithless people even brother
[2:05:08] Brandon would say yeah that he saw it in
[2:05:11] his generation he said he said I life
[2:05:15] has been going about in the land in
[2:05:19] preachers saying the days of miracles
[2:05:24] are past and there's no such thing as
[2:05:27] divine healing do you realize what this
[2:05:30] man had to go up against Oh generation
[2:05:35] of unbelief oh man you think he was
[2:05:39] lauded by the newspapers and by the
[2:05:41] preachers he wasn't he was rejected
[2:05:44] oh man they were ridiculed him they made
[2:05:49] fun of him but there his name in the
[2:05:51] paper they there are all kinds of things
[2:05:55] but he said the enemy Goliath has been
[2:05:59] going up the land up and down the
[2:06:02] country saying the days of miracles is
[2:06:04] past he says now I'm going out as a
[2:06:07] David with a little slingshot does
[2:06:12] somebody ever hear this of what faith
[2:06:18] hey man no oh
[2:06:21] David did you got five stones amen amen
[2:06:27] he says some say that he got five stones
[2:06:30] because he got one for Goliath and rest
[2:06:33] for his brothers Amen but he you know he
[2:06:37] he only he got in there brother Brandon
[2:06:39] said he would select them he selected
[2:06:41] those stones and he typed it out to the
[2:06:44] name of Jesus Jes
[2:06:46] yes right man so you reached out now why
[2:06:51] he listened he didn't get but to Jake
[2:06:54] before the devil was there on the ground
[2:07:09] [Applause]
[2:07:11] I'm talking about people you think
[2:07:14] you've got a quote the devil every
[2:07:16] scripture in the Bible just take one the
[2:07:20] Word of God will defeat the devil
[2:07:22] anywhere any place any time just take
[2:07:27] one word of course we live by every word
[2:07:33] but I've just one more to defeat him
[2:07:36] hallelujah
[2:07:38] so David would take and sling that stone
[2:07:43] let it go Giants fell a man we've seen
[2:07:49] that happen in our generation a man but
[2:07:53] after David there was other men the men
[2:07:55] of David that went out and found the
[2:07:57] rest of glass brothers you see any good
[2:08:01] enough to concent of profit and killed
[2:08:03] Goliath and then we got to get them all
[2:08:07] down every enemy we cannot be satisfied
[2:08:10] leaving one enemy in our promised land
[2:08:14] we must take it off but you see it is my
[2:08:18] friends that we do it and it's my faith
[2:08:20] and the Word of God that's how we
[2:08:22] possess it
[2:08:28] now all down to the ages we can look we
[2:08:36] can see rather if you want the greatest
[2:08:39] weapon there ever was and that's that
[2:08:43] tomb of Jesus because there he defeated
[2:08:47] death hell and the grave and I want you
[2:08:50] to know as his children today all your
[2:08:52] enemies is defeated cancer is defeated a
[2:08:59] man's sickness of all kinds is defeated
[2:09:02] generational curses is defeated
[2:09:07] is it anybody still with me doctrines of
[2:09:11] devils the Bible calls him doctrines of
[2:09:14] devils and seducing spirits but they're
[2:09:18] all defeated and at Calvary he defeated
[2:09:22] both sin I want you to know there's not
[2:09:26] a sin problem that you're dealing with
[2:09:28] this morning that he didn't defeat
[2:09:31] everyone I'm undefeated do you realize
[2:09:35] the devil don't have a legal right on
[2:09:37] you he does not have a claim on you you
[2:09:41] don't have a right to you he has not a
[2:09:43] right to your body
[2:09:45] he has not a right to your spirit he is
[2:09:47] not a right to your soul but you got a
[2:09:52] right and that's a casts him out and it
[2:09:56] won't happen until you get out of your
[2:09:58] lethargic ways and put your faith into
[2:10:00] action and say I defy that devil
[2:10:03] [Applause]
[2:10:07] because I'm going forth in the power of
[2:10:09] the Resurrection because Satan is

[2:13:34] cell and his hand falls on something he
[2:13:40] was given when he started out on the
[2:13:44] journey and he reaches down there and he
[2:13:47] says it's a key it's the key of promise
[2:13:56] hallelujah and he says I wonder if it'll
[2:14:00] fit this lock and all of a sudden faith
[2:14:04] comes into them to start using a promise
[2:14:08] and he puts that promise in the door of
