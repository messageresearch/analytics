[31:58] we understand why we have gray hair
[32:02] I'd like to thank brother Tim and
[32:04] brother Timothy for inviting us to come
[32:07] the burden to continue this camp
[32:10] and thank everybody that's behind the
[32:12] scenes working so hard and making sure
[32:15] everything is just set up so right and
[32:17] we'd like to thank you for that
[32:19] I'm deeply honored to stand here
[32:22] and for those that know it's a
[32:24] phenomenal miracle that we're able to be
[32:26] here and to stand here once again
[32:29] and defy the odds
[32:31] and we're we're so honored at that I
[32:34] want to remember sister Erica this
[32:36] morning that God would just touch her
[32:38] she has a great need and we just know
[32:41] that God's able
[32:42] for sister Erica and myself there was a
[32:46] conversation that took place in a cave
[32:52] that conversation led to the disease
[32:55] that we would fight
[32:57] and that disease of liver cancer that
[33:01] she has to fight and I stand here
[33:03] fighting brain cancer and lung cancer
[33:05] but that's nothing to God
[33:10] yes
[33:20] and when the angel said not even cancer
[33:24] not even cancer
[33:26] God was looking down the realm and
[33:28] seeing us standing here and so
[33:31] you know but maybe your cancer sin
[33:37] and it's way more deadly than the one
[33:39] that I'm fighting
[33:41] you see if you hear that I die oh don't
[33:45] you believe it for a second I'll be more
[33:47] alive there than I am here
[33:51] but I want you I've come with a burden
[33:53] on my heart that the cancer that you're
[33:55] fighting can be delivered this weekend
[34:00] and every every part of that cancer can
[34:03] be dissolved
[34:04] and it's not by chemo it's by the blood
[34:07] of Jesus Christ
[34:09] and it's already paid for
[34:13] amen and so we love you we love you with
[34:16] all of our hearts and we're just honored
[34:18] to be here

[34:25] Linda we're praying amen

[35:33] friends a long long time and so not
[35:36] going to tell you how many years they
[35:37] told it last night no need in
[35:39] reiterating it so
[35:41] amen so we love them I saw sister Ella
[35:45] here last night
[35:47] amen
[35:48] Eli she in the building today amen we're
[35:52] so honored to be a part of her life and
[35:55] what she is is a miracle in progress and
[35:58] so
[35:59] amen amen
[36:02] I'd like to speak to you today on what
[36:04] will you
[36:05] be remembered for
[36:12] what will you be remembered for
[36:18] great books have a lot of parts
[36:22] they have introductions
[36:24] the chapters are lined up
[36:27] generally in the first chapter it's a
[36:29] it's a chapter of grabbing your
[36:31] attention
[36:32] so that you won't lay the 300 Page book
[36:34] down
[36:36] it grabs your attention in a way to
[36:38] where that you've realized that if I
[36:40] don't read this book I'm going to be
[36:42] missing a part in my life
[36:45] it brings great Intrigue to it then it
[36:48] begins to go into the body of work it's
[36:50] the it's the behind the scenes chaos
[36:54] brings the miracle together of life
[36:58] then as it begins to come to the winding
[37:00] down of it to leave you with great great
[37:03] feelings it begins to come toward the
[37:05] final chapters
[37:07] and as it comes to the final chapters it
[37:10] will bring conclusion to your life
[37:15] there's a lot of things that you will
[37:16] accomplish in your life
[37:18] but I'd like to just kind of give you a
[37:20] little little teaser
[37:22] without Jesus
[37:27] without Jesus it's not even worth living
[37:32] I want you to understand there were
[37:34] millionaires when Martin Luther were
[37:37] here
[37:38] John Wesley was here we know nothing
[37:40] about them
[37:43] we know absolutely nothing about them
[37:45] but we know a man named John Wesley
[37:51] that preached about 88 000 sermons that
[37:54] was the messenger to his day
[37:57] we know something about him because his
[38:00] work was incredibly important
[38:02] we know something about the messenger of
[38:05] this day
[38:06] right that shook the Earth
[38:09] that was allowed to be a vessel of
[38:12] Malachi 4.
[38:13] because you were the one that was
[38:16] important because this book
[38:18] was after you
[38:22] I'm thankful I thank the Lord to be here
[38:25] to kind of to be at the part of the
[38:28] starting of your life
[38:30] because starting is important
[38:34] if you're going to run a race you want
[38:36] to start right
[38:38] when you get into the blocks of running
[38:40] you want to put your feet right you want
[38:42] your breathing right you want your mind
[38:44] right you want to be focused those first
[38:47] few steps are incredibly important
[38:50] that's one of the things that this
[38:52] meeting is so important the focus is to
[38:57] make sure you're start and your
[38:59] continuation maybe many of you've been
[39:01] here for years but the continuing of the
[39:04] work
[39:07] it is so important
[39:09] if you will turn with me to Luke chapter
[39:12] 23
[39:13] or John chapter 23
[39:16] and verse 26.
[39:24] I said John it's Luke I'm not a bit
[39:27] nervous
[39:31] Luke chapter 23 and verse 26.
[39:38] amen
[39:41] so glad to have my wife with me
[39:43] my family with me Andrew with me
[39:47] and uh
[39:49] you see a miracle I may be a miracle in
[39:52] flesh he's a miracle and
[39:55] and soul
[39:57] and so you can't make your children
[39:59] Christians
[40:01] but when you see them get a supernatural
[40:03] touch that's a miracle
[40:06] Luke chapter 23 and verse 26.
[40:10] and as they led him away
[40:14] they laid hold upon one Simon
[40:17] a serene
[40:19] coming out of the country and on him
[40:22] they laid the cross
[40:24] that he might bear it after Jesus
[40:28] and there followed him a great company
[40:30] of people
[40:32] and of women
[40:33] which also beweld and lamented
[40:37] but Jesus turned unto them and said
[40:40] Daughters of Jerusalem wheat not for me
[40:43] but weep for yourselves and for your
[40:46] children
[40:46] for behold the days are coming in which
[40:49] they shall say blessed are the barren
[40:52] and the wounds that never bear
[40:55] and the past which never gave suck
[40:59] then shall they begin to say to the
[41:02] mountains fall on us
[41:04] and to the hills cover us
[41:07] for if they do these things in a green
[41:10] tree what shall they be done in a dry
[41:13] and there were also two other malfactors
[41:17] LED with him to be put to death
[41:20] and when they were come to the place
[41:23] which is called Calvary
[41:26] They Crucified him and the mouth actors
[41:30] one on the right hand and the other on
[41:33] the left
[41:34] and then Jesus then said Jesus
[41:38] father forgive them
[41:40] for they know not what they do
[41:44] and they parted his Rhema and cast lots
[41:48] and the people stood beholding and the
[41:51] rulers also which deriled him saying he
[41:55] saved others
[41:58] let him save himself if he made the
[42:01] Christ the chosen one
[42:04] and the soldiers also mocked him coming
[42:08] to him and offering him vinegar and
[42:11] saying if thou be the king of the Jews
[42:14] save thyself

[43:47] and Jesus is speaking to his Believers
[43:49] and these things have I told you that
[43:52] that when the when the time shall come
[43:56] ye may remember what I have told you of
[44:00] them
[44:01] and these things I said not unto you at
[44:04] the beginning
[44:06] because I was with you
[44:08] notice how this book is unfolding
[44:11] it's a progressive
[44:13] and now I go my way to him that sent me
[44:18] and none of you asketh me where there
[44:21] goest thou
[44:23] but because I have said these things
[44:26] unto you
[44:27] sorrow have filled your hearts
[44:30] nevertheless I tell you the truth it is
[44:33] expedient for you that I go away
[44:37] for if I go not away the comforter will
[44:40] not come unto you but if I depart I will
[44:43] send him unto you
[44:45] and when he has come he will reprove the
[44:49] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[44:51] Judgment of sin because they believe not
[44:54] on me of righteousness because I go to
[44:57] my father and ye shall see me no more of
[45:01] judgment because the prince of this
[45:04] world is judged he's saying a whole lot

[45:32] has come he will guide you
[45:36] into all truth
[45:39] for he shall not speak of himself but
[45:42] whatsoever ye shall hear that shall he
[45:46] speak and he will show you things to
[45:49] come
[45:50] he will glorify me for he shall receive
[45:54] and of mine and shall show it unto you
[45:57] all things that the father hath are mine
[46:01] therefore said I that he shall take of
[46:05] mine and shall show it unto you
[46:09] a little while and you shall not see me
[46:12] and again a little while and you shall
[46:16] see me because I go unto the father
[46:20] brother random would say it like this
[46:23] and he's talking about Satan he took him
[46:26] up on a mountain
[46:27] and he set him down
[46:30] and he rebuked him again with the word

[46:39] now he's going to bring you into the
[46:41] picture

[47:17] and that is the greatest weapon that you
[47:20] can have a covenant with God
[47:23] and he gives you the words of life and
[47:27] you take those words as a believer
[47:33] your position and you take the words of
[47:37] eternal life and use it on the devil

[52:04] now tell me we're some weak where she
[52:07] worship backbone
[52:10] we are the Queen of Heaven
[52:11] [Applause]
[52:19] I have read that over the last three
[52:22] years
[52:22] hundreds of times
[52:25] I've often thought about what it must
[52:27] have felt like in the room
[52:30] where the author was writing
[52:33] and the Holy Spirit was helping him put
[52:36] that together
[52:38] because there will be a lot of people
[52:40] like you that would need to read it
[52:42] again
[52:44] to inspire it again
[52:48] I've often thought about the Apostle
[52:51] Paul when he writes the book of Hebrews
[52:54] he's going to capture men's lives
[52:58] and maybe they lived hundreds of years
[53:01] maybe just only a few years
[53:05] and he's going to capture a portion of
[53:08] their lives
[53:09] in a sentence
[53:13] the book of Hebrews chapter 11 is a hall
[53:15] of faith
[53:17] people that by faith
[53:20] receive the promise
[53:22] we heard last night that Satan Stacks a
[53:25] lot of facts against us
[53:28] but whose report do we believe
[53:30] [Applause]
[53:34] I expose myself today and stand here
[53:36] before you they've told me over and over
[53:39] again of of my end and how it will be
[53:42] and all of those different kinds of
[53:43] things gave me months to live set and
[53:46] cried with me
[53:47] listen they were doing their best as
[53:49] doctors
[53:51] they're practicing Physicians trying to
[53:53] help Mankind we appreciate doctors and
[53:56] nurses and Medicine
[53:58] we appreciate what they do but we have a
[54:02] higher doctor
[54:12] he may be unseen
[54:14] but you can feel him in the room
[54:18] it may not be your faith but he reaches
[54:21] down and grabs a hold to you
[54:24] and when you equipped
[54:27] our Prophet wanted to quit many great
[54:30] leaders wanted to quit
[54:32] maybe you've wanted to quit every great
[54:35] person has wanted to quit at some point
[54:38] but you would have quit if you could
[54:41] but there was a lot more chapters that
[54:44] had to be written
[54:46] there was a lot more sermons that had to
[54:48] be preached
[54:50] there's a lot more things that you've
[54:52] got to do in your life
[54:55] and maybe you can't see your future but
[54:58] there's books and chapters that have to
[55:00] be written in your life but brother Ron
[55:02] I'm a nobody
[55:07] I've made a lot of failures
[55:10] well let me let me just share a couple
[55:12] from background
[55:14] Noah was a drunk
[55:18] Abraham was too old
[55:23] Isaac was a Daydreamer
[55:26] Jacob was a liar
[55:29] Leo was ugly
[55:36] but she was hated
[55:38] but she brought forth
[55:43] Judah
[55:46] and then she would be one that would say
[55:49] I will now praise the Lord
[55:52] it didn't matter about being hated it
[55:55] didn't matter about being ugly
[55:59] listen if we could ever come to a party
[56:01] in our lives God made us like we are
[56:04] if we could ever come to the Comfort in
[56:06] her own skill
[56:09] quit looking and pattern after Hollywood
[56:12] and realize that God made us
[56:16] exactly how we are
[56:24] tall short skinny fluffy
[56:31] nervous
[56:33] Philip I saw you look
[56:37] nervous
[56:39] stubborn
[56:41] high tension
[56:43] great passion
[56:45] driven
[56:46] God knew every element that he put in
[56:49] your body
[56:51] he knew what you would be like because
[56:53] he had a book that he had to write and
[56:56] he had your name on it
[57:01] it had your name on it and regardless of
[57:04] how you feel about your Humanity
[57:08] that's only the temporal part he put a
[57:11] seed on the inside of you
[57:14] of eternal life
[57:16] the very Gene seed of God no he's not
[57:19] counting on your flesh
[57:24] he's not counting on your flesh but he
[57:26] has confidence in the sea that he put on
[57:29] the inside of you
[57:32] and if that seed comes to life
[57:35] you will realize that there's a lot of
[57:38] chapters that's got to be taken place
[57:40] [Applause]
[57:44] don't worry
[57:45] Rahab was a prostitute
[57:50] David had a an affair
[57:53] and was a murderer
[57:57] Elijah was suicidal
[58:00] Jonah ran from God
[58:02] wound up in a great fish
[58:06] Joe went bankrupt
[58:11] even Peter
[58:12] after all that he saw
[58:15] denied the Lord
[58:18] he walked away
[58:20] cursed
[58:21] used abominable names
[58:29] man
[58:32] the disciples fell asleep while Jesus
[58:35] was praying
[58:37] his most critical prayer
[58:41] his disciples fell asleep
[58:44] that's what gives us preachers hope
[58:51] [Applause]
[58:58] the Samaritan woman was divorced over
[59:00] and over and over again
[59:03] yet Jesus went to her out of his way
[59:07] when the disciples
[59:09] couldn't see nothing good in her
[59:12] and no church actually wanted her
[59:16] Jesus said I can use her
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:21] now your first few pages of your book
[59:24] may have a lot of these things in it
[59:30] you see you've written those things
[59:33] you've lived those things you know those
[59:36] things about yourself
[59:39] difficult maybe for Moses to write
[59:42] High tempered
[59:45] struck the rock twice
[59:48] difficult that he has to write his
[59:50] Humanity no doubt difficult for brother
[59:53] Branham to be honest
[59:55] and tell us mistakes in fact I'm glad he
[59:57] did
[1:00:00] I'm really glad he did that he that he
[1:00:02] just shared with us his Humanity
[1:00:06] that it make mistakes it gives you
[1:00:08] confidence to get back up
[1:00:11] [Applause]
[1:00:14] let me just say oh my brother Ron this
[1:00:16] is Hollywood this is you know when I
[1:00:18] become a Christian all my troubles will
[1:00:20] be over with look around
[1:00:22] take a deep breath look around
[1:00:26] God is going to overcome in you so
[1:00:28] there's going to be some battles
[1:00:32] there's some battles that lays ahead of
[1:00:34] you
[1:00:36] there's some real difficult times that
[1:00:39] lays ahead for you there are some
[1:00:41] discouragements that lays ahead for you
[1:00:43] but it's his Divine will
[1:00:46] friends are going to walk away from you
[1:00:50] I'm talking about Bosom Buddies are
[1:00:52] going to walk away from you and if you
[1:00:54] can only realize if they can walk away
[1:00:56] from you it wasn't your friend to start
[1:00:59] off with
[1:01:00] [Applause]
[1:01:02] and let me just say if if your friends
[1:01:05] are not taking you toward God
[1:01:08] they're not your friends
[1:01:19] if the power of your influence around
[1:01:21] you is not in a Revival of the message
[1:01:24] of the hour hungry for God hungry for
[1:01:27] church
[1:01:29] if all of their minds is just total
[1:01:31] carnality all the times they're not
[1:01:34] guiding you in the right direction
[1:01:39] I know all of us has got friends that
[1:01:42] are in the world but let me just say
[1:01:43] this you don't let them influence your
[1:01:46] life
[1:01:47] [Applause]
[1:01:57] by faith Abraham
[1:02:00] by faith Jacob
[1:02:05] by faith Moses
[1:02:10] by faith
[1:02:12] Joshua
[1:02:16] by faith are Ahab
[1:02:19] if you'll notice
[1:02:22] he mentions her
[1:02:24] here
[1:02:26] God's not ashamed that she was a harlot
[1:02:32] he's not ashamed of where you are
[1:02:38] now let me just say God knows how to
[1:02:40] take the actors mask off
[1:02:44] he knows the real you
[1:02:46] [Applause]
[1:02:48] and so he wants the real you to know the
[1:02:52] real him
[1:02:56] Rahab knew that these two spies had
[1:02:59] something
[1:03:00] that she had never
[1:03:02] never had in her life
[1:03:05] she hadn't met a lot of men from that
[1:03:07] City but none of them had what they had
[1:03:12] and circumstances of Life had bound her
[1:03:15] to that position
[1:03:18] circumstances and chains kept her there
[1:03:21] working on the wall in the red light
[1:03:24] district
[1:03:25] but God
[1:03:30] God
[1:03:31] knew if I can only get the pen out of
[1:03:34] her hand
[1:03:38] and put it in my hat
[1:03:41] I've got a plan for her
[1:03:46] if God can only get the pen of Will and
[1:03:50] self-wheel out of your hands
[1:03:54] and get it into his hand
[1:03:57] and you become a prisoner to Jesus
[1:04:00] Christ
[1:04:01] a love slave
[1:04:06] oh my brother Ron I'll have to do this
[1:04:08] and I have to give up this if you ever
[1:04:10] meet Jesus
[1:04:12] there's nothing in this world that
[1:04:14] matters anymore
[1:04:16] Super Bowls won't matter no more
[1:04:18] Hollywood won't matter no more racing
[1:04:21] won't matter no more rock and roll won't
[1:04:24] matter anymore
[1:04:29] you and Jesus are a majority
[1:04:37] the scripture says in Hebrews 11 verse
[1:04:39] 32
[1:04:40] and notice how Paul begins to write
[1:04:42] these things he said what more shall I
[1:04:44] say for the time should fail me to tell
[1:04:47] you of of Gideon
[1:04:50] I loved that last night and a bear Arc
[1:04:54] and of Samson
[1:04:56] and of jaffna
[1:04:58] and of David
[1:05:00] and of Samuel
[1:05:01] and of the prophets
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:06] these men live phenomenal lives
[1:05:10] had phenomenal Supernatural lives
[1:05:14] David kills a giant with a stone
[1:05:18] Moses stands and watches the water raise
[1:05:21] up
[1:05:22] Samson puts his hand on the pillars and
[1:05:24] he's blind and he pushes and kills more
[1:05:28] people at his death than all of his life
[1:05:32] but when God looks at it through the
[1:05:34] prophet Paul he just mentions their name
[1:05:37] all in a sentence
[1:05:42] well brother Ron but I didn't get a full
[1:05:44] chapter in the Bible don't matter
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:52] maybe you're like shamgarth
[1:05:55] and you've just got one scripture
[1:05:57] [Applause]
[1:05:58] in the whole book
[1:06:01] but one man
[1:06:05] got so tired
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:08] of the enemy coming into his camp
[1:06:15] and God would take brother Branham
[1:06:18] The Seer of the word
[1:06:20] the one that could look in the Garden of
[1:06:22] Eden and see exactly what Eve looked
[1:06:24] like
[1:06:26] and exactly what the serpent looked like
[1:06:28] and how they walked out of the Garden of
[1:06:31] Eden could also looking
[1:06:33] shamgar's life
[1:06:38] over brother Ron maybe he was making up
[1:06:40] a story really
[1:06:44] and he begins to talk about him
[1:06:46] and as he begins to talk about him said
[1:06:48] no doubt the enemy had came year after
[1:06:51] year after year
[1:06:53] and had taken
[1:06:55] all of the crop and left him just enough
[1:06:57] to get him through the till next camp
[1:06:58] meeting
[1:07:01] and he could get back to the next Youth
[1:07:03] Camp
[1:07:06] and here comes 600 Philistines armed
[1:07:09] trained soldiers
[1:07:11] he wasn't a soldier he was a farmer
[1:07:16] and he said he looked over at his wife
[1:07:18] and how skinny she was and
[1:07:23] threads on her clothes was just Barren
[1:07:25] and he explains it in great detail
[1:07:29] because God remembers
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:07:34] God remembers it may have been thousands
[1:07:36] of years later but one scripture was
[1:07:39] important to the prophet and it was
[1:07:41] important to God
[1:07:43] don't tell me your life is not important
[1:07:45] to God
[1:07:47] don't tell me you're a nobody maybe the
[1:07:50] enemy has come with 600 Devils to your
[1:07:54] house day after day after day and trying
[1:07:56] to destroy you
[1:08:00] is it going to be just another day
[1:08:03] is it going to be just another time
[1:08:06] something responded in the inside of of
[1:08:09] shamgar that he was a Seed of Abraham
[1:08:13] and he remembered that in the word that
[1:08:16] Abraham had set with Melchizedek and
[1:08:18] Melchizedek had said thy seed shall
[1:08:22] possess the gates of their enemy
[1:08:24] and he picked up a stick
[1:08:28] and he started beating Philistines one
[1:08:31] at a time
[1:08:37] one at a time
[1:08:39] brother Davey I'd say one at a time one
[1:08:42] fell that gave him courage for the
[1:08:43] second one
[1:08:45] that gave him courage for the third one
[1:08:47] that gave him courage for the fourth one
[1:08:49] that gave him courage for the tenth one
[1:08:52] he gave him courage for the 50th one
[1:08:57] what about your sticks
[1:09:02] what about your stick
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:06] God give you the courage to pick it up
[1:09:09] give me the courage to start
[1:09:11] [Applause]
[1:09:18] come out of the gate ready
[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:21] I am a Seed of Abraham
[1:09:25] I'm that bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:28] I am the final voice to the final age
[1:09:31] you didn't think that about yourself
[1:09:33] that's what God sent you was
[1:09:36] you are the super race you didn't think
[1:09:39] that about yourself that's what God
[1:09:42] thought of you
[1:09:43] God sent you a bone of your bones bone
[1:09:46] of these bones life of his life
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:50] he calls you an invincible Army
[1:09:54] [Applause]
[1:09:57] that in just a family's phrase that
[1:09:59] comes around that wasn't just William
[1:10:01] branham's phrase about you that was
[1:10:04] God's phrase foreign
[1:10:07] God saved you till the end of the
[1:10:10] laodicea
[1:10:12] knowing the wars that were going to come
[1:10:14] against you the spirits are going to
[1:10:16] come against you
[1:10:20] brother Brown said your mother faced ten
[1:10:22] times the Devils that are her mother
[1:10:24] faced
[1:10:25] and then the next Generation faces a
[1:10:28] hundred times what the mother face
[1:10:30] then it multiplies to a thousand
[1:10:36] but God didn't leave you depleted
[1:10:42] I want you to punch your neighbor and
[1:10:44] tell them that preacher is talking about
[1:10:46] you
[1:10:55] he's talking about you
[1:10:58] it's all about you Marcus I'm talking
[1:11:00] about you
[1:11:02] talk about you
[1:11:05] come you came a long way and I picked
[1:11:07] you out he's talking about you
[1:11:10] he's talking about you back there
[1:11:13] Carl I'm talking about you
[1:11:15] sorry sister Carter
[1:11:18] that's my sister
[1:11:21] listen I'm talking about you
[1:11:29] brother L I'm talking about you
[1:11:34] we're an invincible Army
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:38] because we will not pay attention to the
[1:11:40] facts
[1:11:57] yeah we could get killed here in a few
[1:11:59] minutes destroyed
[1:12:02] what are you gonna do I got a stick
[1:12:09] can you imagine what the family was
[1:12:11] doing
[1:12:13] somebody's got a shout
[1:12:16] somebody's got to sing
[1:12:19] so his family was back I don't know near
[1:12:21] the barn
[1:12:23] while he was in the field with a stick
[1:12:26] in his hand
[1:12:28] and he's going to whip him so bad
[1:12:31] I can hear it
[1:12:34] as he knocks the last one down screaming
[1:12:37] don't never come back
[1:12:55] now it's your turn why don't you tell
[1:12:58] those less devils
[1:13:00] those music devils
[1:13:05] those back-slidden doubles why don't you
[1:13:08] tell them why you hit them in the head
[1:13:12] God come back no more
[1:13:20] Utah
[1:13:22] it's your turn you tell them don't come
[1:13:26] back
[1:13:42] now
[1:13:43] here's what I want you to do this is
[1:13:45] exercise part of it
[1:13:48] because the most Supernatural thing
[1:13:50] about you is your tongue
[1:13:55] and it has the power
[1:13:57] to produce a negative atmosphere
[1:14:03] or it has the power to speak the spoken
[1:14:06] word
[1:14:08] do you know why we sink
[1:14:11] we sing testimonies
[1:14:14] victory is mine victory is mine
[1:14:19] there is going to be a meeting in the
[1:14:21] air
[1:14:22] and you pass those powerful inspired
[1:14:25] words across your lips
[1:14:28] and your ears hear what you are saying
[1:14:32] because your voice is different than
[1:14:34] anybody else's voice
[1:14:37] and God hears your voice through the
[1:14:41] blood
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:46] are you with me now
[1:14:48] we're getting to some good parts
[1:14:51] why don't you pick up your six foot
[1:14:54] stick
[1:14:55] come on
[1:14:57] and I want to hear you say
[1:15:00] not your neighbor I want you to say to
[1:15:03] the devil don't come back
[1:15:07] now say it with attitude
[1:15:11] you're getting there
[1:15:12] don't come back
[1:15:14] [Applause]
[1:15:35] I'm going to share something with you
[1:15:37] that I probably shouldn't
[1:15:40] preachers do that
[1:15:45] but uh
[1:15:46] in my life I've been a boxing fan
[1:15:55] you know because God was going to make
[1:15:57] me a boxer
[1:16:00] and I spend about an hour here
[1:16:04] knocking the enemy out
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:08] brother Branham was a boxer
[1:16:11] and he was going to be honest with you
[1:16:13] that's why I got started liking boxing
[1:16:16] because I was a little boy I'd hear
[1:16:18] brother Brandon talking about his fights
[1:16:20] talking about training and talking about
[1:16:22] hitting with the left and hitting with
[1:16:23] the right
[1:16:25] now that all got me in trouble when I
[1:16:27] became a late teenager because I
[1:16:29] practiced it
[1:16:39] one of the greatest Corner men was a man
[1:16:41] named Angelo Dundee
[1:16:45] Angelo Dundee was not a fighter but he
[1:16:48] knew how to coach
[1:16:50] some of the greatest that ever lived
[1:16:53] Aaron you're going to love this
[1:16:56] I can just hear it in a few sermons from
[1:16:58] now brother Ron said
[1:17:07] oh Dundee said when I would have
[1:17:09] Muhammad Ali in in the boxing match
[1:17:13] he said I didn't have to teach him how
[1:17:16] to fight
[1:17:17] he knew how to fight
[1:17:19] he's he said but I had to remind him of
[1:17:22] who he was
[1:17:23] [Applause]
[1:17:37] said many times he was getting whipped
[1:17:40] and out pointed
[1:17:42] he said I didn't tell him about lefts
[1:17:44] and rights
[1:17:46] he didn't tell him about ducking his
[1:17:48] head he said I had to tell him you are
[1:17:51] the champion
[1:17:52] [Applause]
[1:17:55] you are the champion
[1:17:57] now go fight Lasix
[1:18:08] I like one of the things he said that
[1:18:11] other guy knows you're the champion
[1:18:14] he believes you're the champion
[1:18:17] and he knows it's coming so give it to
[1:18:21] him
[1:18:33] now let me just say this to you if I can
[1:18:35] be Angelo Dundee for a few minutes
[1:18:38] I don't have to tell you how to fight
[1:18:41] it's on the inside of you
[1:18:45] I don't have to give you the weapons
[1:18:47] you've already got it
[1:18:49] I just got to remind you of Who You Are
[1:18:53] I don't care if you're 13 or you're 35.
[1:18:58] you're a champion of laodicea you're
[1:19:02] built to do the job
[1:19:20] now in a book
[1:19:25] in a book
[1:19:26] you're writing it
[1:19:29] and sometimes you remember the difficult
[1:19:31] parts
[1:19:34] and Satan will bring those difficult
[1:19:36] Parts back to you because he don't
[1:19:38] really have a lot to work with
[1:19:40] once you know who you are
[1:19:43] all he can do is pick on your flesh and
[1:19:45] your memory and your conscience and he
[1:19:47] wants to remind you and keep you
[1:19:48] defeated
[1:19:52] so
[1:19:54] can you give me about 10 more minutes
[1:20:11] well brother Ron You Don't Preach like
[1:20:13] you used to well
[1:20:15] I had to reinvent myself a little bit
[1:20:21] just because I got cancer in my lungs
[1:20:23] and it hurts when I preach don't mean I
[1:20:26] quit
[1:20:27] I just learned how to fight a little
[1:20:30] different
[1:20:33] that means my lefts and rights come
[1:20:35] quick and they come harsh and
[1:20:42] thank you
[1:20:51] there was a man in prison
[1:20:55] his book had been a horrible book
[1:21:00] it would be something that you would
[1:21:02] read in Halloween
[1:21:06] it was horrendous
[1:21:08] it was nothing to be proud of
[1:21:12] he had made failure after failure after
[1:21:15] failure we don't know nothing about his
[1:21:17] family
[1:21:18] we don't know nothing about him other
[1:21:20] than he's in jail
[1:21:24] and being in jail he's incarcerated and
[1:21:26] anybody can live right in jail
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:31] well I think I've found some people
[1:21:34] that's been in jail before
[1:21:41] and so he's in jail he's he's been
[1:21:44] caught
[1:21:48] the law says that he's got to die
[1:21:51] now you would think
[1:21:54] as he's coming into his final week that
[1:21:57] this is the last chapter
[1:22:00] but this is only the beginning
[1:22:05] now today it's a strange sort of day
[1:22:09] he's going to die with a God that's
[1:22:12] had a book like his
[1:22:15] but there's another man
[1:22:21] there's another man that's with him he
[1:22:24] don't deserve to die
[1:22:27] he's he'll sit
[1:22:29] he's fed thousands
[1:22:31] he's turned water into wine
[1:22:36] now this this thief has never heard a
[1:22:39] sermon
[1:22:41] he's never saw a miracle
[1:22:45] he's going to have to carry his cross up
[1:22:48] the hill
[1:22:49] but he's going to witness something
[1:22:51] [Music]
[1:22:53] he's going to witness a man
[1:22:56] as he walks out
[1:22:58] and starts up the journey that refuses
[1:23:01] to quit
[1:23:06] he immediately notices that he's been
[1:23:09] beaten
[1:23:10] like no other human being
[1:23:13] has ever been beaten
[1:23:15] he can see the pulsation of his lungs
[1:23:18] and the pulsations of his organs in his
[1:23:20] body
[1:23:24] what
[1:23:26] screaming down through his cloth
[1:23:29] little dots they come big dots
[1:23:34] he can see the human fatigue setting in
[1:23:37] on him
[1:23:38] but he refuses to quit putting one foot
[1:23:41] in front of the other
[1:23:44] maybe you don't understand why those
[1:23:46] stripes are there
[1:23:49] but they're there for Erica
[1:23:54] they're there for you
[1:23:55] [Applause]
[1:23:57] listen don't ever give up
[1:24:01] don't you ever give up
[1:24:04] I say this to you when it comes and it
[1:24:07] seems like all is hopeless let me just
[1:24:10] say God's got it he's the doctor
[1:24:17] he didn't quit neither said we
[1:24:20] didn't get discouraged neither should we
[1:24:23] [Applause]
[1:24:27] maybe he was puzzled in his mind you see
[1:24:29] he hadn't got to read the book
[1:24:32] maybe it's possible in his mind
[1:24:35] and Jesus didn't have time to turn
[1:24:36] around and say it I'm doing this for Tim
[1:24:39] Pruitt
[1:24:41] yeah that's right
[1:24:47] I'm doing this for Karen
[1:24:51] you see she wasn't defeated
[1:24:56] oh but brother on if you could have only
[1:24:59] saw what I saw I was here with you
[1:25:03] but if you could see
[1:25:05] like brother Donnie was anointed to
[1:25:07] speak her funeral
[1:25:09] and look across the Veil
[1:25:16] she's got a new body
[1:25:19] that's what Jesus was walking up the
[1:25:21] hill for
[1:25:23] because it was in the book
[1:25:26] and Elijah and Moses had stood there
[1:25:29] with him
[1:25:30] on the Mount of transfiguration and told
[1:25:32] him what the word said
[1:25:36] he had to accomplish it
[1:25:38] if I can say this to you today we must
[1:25:41] accomplish our work
[1:25:45] what do you preacher screaming at us for
[1:25:47] we must accomplish
[1:25:53] we must finish this
[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:26:01] he watches every step that he takes
[1:26:05] there's blood in it
[1:26:12] you look at his own Footprints and there
[1:26:15] was no blood
[1:26:18] the man with him there was no blood Lord
[1:26:21] this man had blood
[1:26:24] nobody was screaming their name saying
[1:26:27] Blasphemous names
[1:26:29] they deserved it
[1:26:32] they deserve to die
[1:26:34] their book was written so that the
[1:26:37] Justice was that they died
[1:26:41] but this man
[1:26:44] Satan would not let him die
[1:26:48] without extremely punishment
[1:26:51] not just to his body but to his mind
[1:26:56] so they screamed at him all kind of
[1:26:59] horrible words
[1:27:02] they offered him vinegar
[1:27:06] they said incredibly bad things about
[1:27:08] him
[1:27:10] but he kept stepping
[1:27:13] this man heard the moans
[1:27:17] this man heard the cries
[1:27:20] because Jesus had to die as a man
[1:27:26] as that man he had to suffer
[1:27:29] Adam fell
[1:27:32] if Satan would have only knew what was
[1:27:35] happening today
[1:27:37] Jesus would have had Band-Aids all over
[1:27:40] him
[1:27:43] he would have made him King of the
[1:27:44] universe
[1:27:46] he'd have never let him go to Calvary
[1:27:49] but God so hid himself
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:55] if he only knew who you was
[1:27:58] if he only knew who you was
[1:28:01] he would not torment you another day
[1:28:04] he would not matter you another day
[1:28:10] because at the end of the day you're
[1:28:12] casting on it
[1:28:15] will destroy him
[1:28:18] and the devil that fights against you
[1:28:20] every demon of hell that tries to
[1:28:23] destroy you you will be the testimony
[1:28:26] you will be the book against them
[1:28:35] that will cause his kingdom to come to
[1:28:38] an end
[1:28:39] [Applause]
[1:28:51] Nails in his hands
[1:28:57] Nails in his feet
[1:29:00] the groans
[1:29:06] people are screaming all different kind
[1:29:08] of things
[1:29:12] that thou be the Christ
[1:29:14] you saved others
[1:29:20] save yourself
[1:29:22] the greatest compliment they could ever
[1:29:24] pay him
[1:29:27] you saved others
[1:29:29] save yourself
[1:29:36] one Thief screams across at him
[1:29:39] if you are the Christ
[1:29:43] save us
[1:29:47] makes all kind of fun of him
[1:29:56] and the other one had saw all of this
[1:29:59] and took it into his mind
[1:30:03] he wasn't thinking about how great he
[1:30:04] was
[1:30:06] he knew in a few minutes
[1:30:08] he gonna die
[1:30:11] and this is what he deserved
[1:30:17] he never heard a sermon on a mountain
[1:30:20] had never seen him touch the leopard
[1:30:23] he never heard Lazarus come forth
[1:30:32] but he had enough pressure in his lungs
[1:30:34] that he could say Lord
[1:30:42] Lord
[1:30:46] when you're coming to your kingdom
[1:30:52] remember me
[1:30:54] Lord
[1:31:00] remember me
[1:31:06] his book started
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:10] right there is where his book started
[1:31:14] everything else didn't matter now
[1:31:17] being a thief
[1:31:19] having a wretched life
[1:31:22] it didn't matter now
[1:31:25] his blood
[1:31:29] of all the miracles of Jesus the last
[1:31:32] one was the costliest
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:37] it must have been a complete paradox all
[1:31:40] of these preachers on the ground making
[1:31:42] fun
[1:31:45] all these great religious people making
[1:31:47] sure that he dies
[1:31:50] they had scream crucify him
[1:31:53] and here's a man with a destroyed book
[1:31:57] screaming remember me
[1:32:03] God's got a memory
[1:32:06] yeah God's got a memory
[1:32:09] how important is remember me
[1:32:14] I don't know for this local audience can
[1:32:16] I just put an excerpt here
[1:32:18] last week by the Carmen Mills we
[1:32:21] listened to him together
[1:32:23] brother Carmen Mills
[1:32:25] speaks
[1:32:27] on God's memory
[1:32:30] sister Esther gets up at the end of it
[1:32:33] under anointing
[1:32:37] said this is my time
[1:32:41] almost a month ago I announced to the
[1:32:43] audience of what I was going to speak
[1:32:45] here I never do that
[1:32:48] on what will you be remembered for
[1:32:54] I told brother Tim I said God's got
[1:32:56] something in plans
[1:32:59] I want you to catch it now God's got
[1:33:02] something in his plans
[1:33:06] I preached this two times before one in
[1:33:08] Switzerland
[1:33:10] every time I preached it phenomenal
[1:33:12] Miracles happened
[1:33:15] and the same God's in the building now
[1:33:29] I don't know about your book I we don't
[1:33:31] have time for you to tell every page of
[1:33:33] your book
[1:33:35] but you being here
[1:33:40] you be in him
[1:33:42] tells us that God has gathered you
[1:33:47] because he has remembered you
[1:33:52] he put something on you inside of you
[1:33:56] on these days
[1:33:58] he put us something down on the inside
[1:34:00] of you that you had to get here
[1:34:04] 29 minutes to fill this Camp up you were
[1:34:08] excited to get here
[1:34:10] you wasn't buying rock and roll tickets
[1:34:13] you wasn't buying Super Bowl tickets you
[1:34:16] was under inspiration to be in this camp
[1:34:20] you didn't know where you'd be sitting
[1:34:22] at
[1:34:24] [Applause]
[1:34:25] you didn't know it'd be raining like it
[1:34:27] is
[1:34:31] maybe your book's got a lot of scars
[1:34:35] and you're not so proud of it
[1:34:39] if you could look over tonight and say
[1:34:43] Remember Me Lord
[1:34:47] remember me
[1:34:51] remember me
[1:34:56] and Jesus
[1:34:58] turns to him

[1:35:14] Heaven and Hell
[1:35:17] in hell you fall
[1:35:19] you Falls like an endless eternity
[1:35:23] there's no friends in hell
[1:35:26] there's weeping and gnashing of teeth
[1:35:29] the Holocaust is like a Sunday afternoon
[1:35:31] picnic
[1:35:33] it's a horrendous place to go no friends
[1:35:36] there
[1:35:37] no parties there
[1:35:41] it's done
[1:35:44] to flip it to a place where Satan can
[1:35:47] never touch you again
[1:35:49] [Applause]
[1:36:02] this day
[1:36:06] this day
[1:36:08] you'll be with me
[1:36:11] in Paradise
[1:36:14] I don't know how he felt
[1:36:16] I don't know what sensation he felt
[1:36:23] but his destination was different
[1:36:26] [Applause]
[1:36:39] we do not know how he died
[1:36:42] we don't know the exact minute that he
[1:36:44] left the Earth
[1:36:46] but it was not a demon coming to get him
[1:36:50] [Applause]
[1:36:53] it was an angel
[1:36:56] became his Uber driver
[1:37:01] you see that man throughout his life and
[1:37:04] his decades that he lived didn't know he
[1:37:06] was destined for that
[1:37:09] God had bigger plans
[1:37:11] the woman at the well didn't know she
[1:37:13] was destined for that Rahab didn't know
[1:37:15] she was destined for that
[1:37:17] maybe you didn't know you were destined
[1:37:20] for that
[1:37:22] but God's got big plans in your life
[1:37:25] [Applause]
[1:37:31] maybe you show up at church and Timothy
[1:37:33] is preaching
[1:37:36] God changes your book
[1:37:41] maybe brother Donnie leaves his quotes
[1:37:43] for a little bit
[1:37:44] and leaves his portion that he's had and
[1:37:46] all of a sudden you become in the
[1:37:47] picture and you go my God that man's
[1:37:49] talking about me God's got plans for you
[1:37:54] that's what this meeting is all about
[1:37:56] God's got plans for you
[1:38:02] as I finish let me just say this to you
[1:38:04] it wasn't that you picked you
[1:38:07] God picked you
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:11] [Applause]
[1:38:23] you see us he's looking
[1:38:26] and knowing who's going to
[1:38:28] be in every age
[1:38:33] and he picks brother Branham as the last
[1:38:37] Church H messenger
[1:38:39] then he's going to pick seed
[1:38:42] that will believe that
[1:38:45] now he's got to have some that's
[1:38:47] in brother Brandon's meetings
[1:38:51] and they'll sit and say amen and that's
[1:38:53] a prophet that's Elijah
[1:38:55] but just before Resurrection
[1:38:58] he's got to have young people
[1:39:04] that will literally live in the darkness
[1:39:06] of laodicea
[1:39:12] and know that they can't do it on their
[1:39:15] own
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:16] it's so dark they can't make it so they
[1:39:19] know
[1:39:20] that if God don't pick up the pen
[1:39:24] if God don't pick up my pen
[1:39:29] I'm going to make a mess out of my life
[1:39:32] I'm going to choose the wrong mate I'm
[1:39:34] gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna have the wrong
[1:39:35] job I'm going to wind up out of church
[1:39:39] but if God picks up your pen
[1:39:44] he knows where he needs you at
[1:39:58] now you see a few years ago
[1:40:01] that guy that's standing over there
[1:40:03] no that's not Goliath
[1:40:06] that's one of Goliath's killers
[1:40:10] it was in a meeting like this that
[1:40:13] he was just enjoying writing a book but
[1:40:16] now God needed him to be a preacher
[1:40:21] and I'm sure that that evening
[1:40:25] you know no man calls a man to preach we
[1:40:27] just kind of recognize the gift and
[1:40:32] there's no way that
[1:40:34] you would have thought that guy's going
[1:40:36] to be a convention speaker
[1:40:40] but that guy's a phenomenal preacher
[1:40:45] listen I am not bragging on him I'm
[1:40:47] bragging on the gift that's in him
[1:40:50] you see he had to lay the pin down
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:40:57] football coach teacher he had to lay the
[1:40:59] pin down
[1:41:01] because God needed him well he did good
[1:41:03] at your place brother Donnie God needed
[1:41:06] him to allow him to pick him up
[1:41:11] and now write with him
[1:41:14] yeah
[1:41:15] no longer his ambition writing with him
[1:41:19] listen you being doc Prescott's coach
[1:41:22] that don't mean nothing
[1:41:24] but you inspiring young people like this
[1:41:40] that's what it's about
[1:41:44] that's what you'll be remembered for
[1:41:47] [Music]
