[0:13] when i'm low
[0:15] in my spirit i cry lord
[0:20] lift me up for i
[0:24] long to go higher
[0:28] with me
[0:32] but he said son
[0:36] you can't grow in this mountain
[0:43] so he picked out a valley
[0:48] for me
[0:53] and he leaves me beside
[0:59] still water
[1:04] somewhere in the valley
[1:09] [Music]
[1:10] below
[1:14] and he drove me aside
[1:19] to be tested
[1:22] and tried in the valley
[1:27] he restored my sword
[1:35] it's dark as a dungeon
[1:40] and the sun seldom shines
[1:45] and i question oh lord
[1:49] why must this be
[1:55] then he tells me there's strength in
[2:00] this trial
[2:04] and there's a victory
[2:07] in the valley for me
[2:11] [Music]
[2:15] and he leaves me beside
[2:20] still water
[2:25] somewhere in the valley
[2:31] below
[2:35] and he draws me aside
[2:40] to be tested
[2:43] and tried in this finale
[2:48] there's a victory for me
[2:56] then he drove me aside
[3:01] to be tested
[3:04] and tried in this valley
[3:09] there's a victory for me
[3:13] [Music]
