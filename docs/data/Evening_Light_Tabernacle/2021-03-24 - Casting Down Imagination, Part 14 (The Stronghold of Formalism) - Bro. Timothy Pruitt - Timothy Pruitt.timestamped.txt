[40:36] we commit our lives to your hands for
[40:38] your glory and for your honor
[40:40] in jesus name amen
[40:45] amen let's turn to second corinthians 10
[40:47] and verse 4
[40:48] also genesis 4 and verse 3. amen how
[40:52] many can say
[40:53] i'm glad when they said unto me let us
[40:55] go into the house of the lord
[40:57] amen it's a wonderful privilege to be
[40:59] able to come together and
[41:01] amen just speaking to different ones
[41:04] yesterday and even today that's over
[41:07] uh in europe and also in the philippines
[41:11] that are
[41:11] back under strict lockdowns and
[41:14] just just crying out for prayer and
[41:17] asking god to intervene so
[41:19] amen i believe god can make a way for
[41:21] those amen
[41:23] amen so it is a privilege to be together
[41:26] something i don't take very lightly and
[41:28] take take for granted but
[41:30] always enjoy the presence of god in the
[41:32] presence of his people
[41:33] second corinthians 10 and verse 4 said
[41:36] for the weapons
[41:37] of our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[41:40] through god to the pulling down of
[41:42] strongholds
[41:43] casting down imaginations in every high
[41:46] thing
[41:46] that exalted itself against the
[41:48] knowledge of god
[41:49] and to bring bringing into captivity
[41:52] every thought
[41:53] to the obedience of christ amen also
[41:57] genesis 4 and verse 3
[41:59] he said in the process of time it came
[42:01] to pass
[42:02] they came brought of the fruit of the
[42:04] ground and offering
[42:05] unto the lord and abel he also brought
[42:08] of the firstlings of his flock
[42:11] and of the fat thereof and the lord had
[42:13] respect and to abel
[42:14] and to his offerings but unto cain and
[42:17] to his offering he had not respect
[42:20] and cain was very wroth and his
[42:22] countenance fell
[42:23] and the lord said unto cain while thou
[42:26] wroth and why is that countless fallen
[42:28] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[42:30] accepted
[42:31] and if thou doest not well sin lieth
[42:35] at the door and unto thee shall be his
[42:38] desire and thou
[42:39] shalt rule over him and cain talked with
[42:42] abel his brother
[42:44] and it came to pass when they were in
[42:45] the field they
[42:47] came rose up against abel his brother
[42:49] and slew him
[42:51] amen we'll let you be seated this
[42:53] evening
[42:56] just like to speak to you on once again
[42:59] casting down imaginations
[43:01] but also the stronghold of formalism
[43:06] stronghold of formalism
[43:10] you know in hearing and recognizing and
[43:12] acting on the word of god
[43:14] the prophet would say this he said
[43:16] whenever there is a revival
[43:18] it always produces twins when there was
[43:21] a birth from
[43:23] isaac and rebecca it produced twins
[43:26] when the world was created as we read in
[43:28] the bible here of twins adam
[43:30] or abel and cain it produces two when is
[43:33] when ishmael and isaac was born
[43:35] it produced two when he saw and jacob
[43:37] was born it produced two but
[43:40] one of them of the natural one of them
[43:43] of the earth
[43:44] and or shall we say of death and the
[43:47] other one
[43:48] supernatural one looked at the natural
[43:51] the intellect the other one
[43:53] walked by the spirit and i believe
[43:55] that's a
[43:56] very wonderful uh thing if in your life
[43:58] for the spirit of god
[44:00] has come inside of you and and you're
[44:02] not no longer walking by sight but
[44:04] you're walking by
[44:05] faith and believing in the things of god
[44:08] that all things are possible to them
[44:10] that believe
[44:11] you know and looking at a boys and and
[44:13] these two as we read here
[44:15] uh one was walking by what he saw amen
[44:18] as cain would bring an offer and
[44:20] he would bring of his first fruits he
[44:22] would bring of what he would produce
[44:23] what he could do and the best that he
[44:26] could do now
[44:27] they both came to church they both
[44:28] worshiped they both came to
[44:30] give an offering unto god it wasn't that
[44:32] cain was trying to do something evil he
[44:34] was trying to
[44:36] bring something before god but he was
[44:38] not coming
[44:39] by spiritual revelation he was coming by
[44:41] intellectual knowledge
[44:43] amen and that is what is very very a
[44:46] tricky thing in this hour
[44:47] amen god is not coming for an
[44:49] intellectual church he's coming for a
[44:51] spiritual church
[44:53] he's coming from a for a church that has
[44:55] been born of his spirit
[44:56] amen that's walking by the faith of
[44:58] almighty god
[44:59] amen is not offering of what they can do
[45:02] or how good they are
[45:03] how great they are but it's all about
[45:05] what he has done
[45:06] and this is where abel would be able to
[45:08] look beyond what was
[45:09] before him in his sight and he would
[45:12] realize it wasn't that
[45:13] it wasn't fruits it took them out of the
[45:15] garden it was
[45:16] it was blood that took them out of the
[45:18] garden it was the sin
[45:20] amen of a fornication that took them out
[45:23] and it would if it was blood that took
[45:24] them out it would have to be a greater
[45:26] blood
[45:27] that would come to take them back in and
[45:29] so this is what abel
[45:31] by spiritual revelation would begin to
[45:33] look and he would say
[45:34] i got to have a lamb and it looked like
[45:36] maybe not the greatest
[45:38] uh type of altar it was a very messy
[45:41] altar it was very ugly altar here cain
[45:43] had built him something up that looked
[45:45] very pretty and no doubt decorated as
[45:47] best as he could
[45:48] and his fruits all in the right place
[45:51] and every his vegetables arranged just
[45:52] right
[45:53] but god wasn't working looking for
[45:55] something that was dead
[45:56] god was looking for something that was
[45:58] alive and
[46:00] god is also the same today he's looking
[46:02] more
[46:03] he's looking for a church that's walking
[46:04] in the supernatural realm
[46:06] that the supernatural god can come down
[46:08] and to meet him
[46:09] he can touch hearts he can touch lives
[46:11] and he's not looking for our works he's
[46:13] not
[46:14] looking for what we've done or how we've
[46:16] how what we've accomplished he's not
[46:17] concerned about all of that
[46:19] but he's looking for life amen he's
[46:21] looking for the blood of the lamb amen
[46:24] and so we see that one walked by
[46:26] intellectuals but the other walk by the
[46:28] spirit
[46:29] and we find that in every revival amen
[46:32] it produces
[46:32] twins every bible has twins they have a
[46:35] bunch in there that's carnal believers
[46:37] and there's a bunch in there the
[46:38] spiritual believers
[46:40] every revival produces an esau and a
[46:42] jacob
[46:43] amen he saw as we would look at him for
[46:46] a moment amen
[46:47] he walked by the intellect well he
[46:49] walked by his feelings what
[46:51] he walked by himself amen as he would
[46:53] come
[46:54] out of the out of the wilderness out on
[46:56] the hunt or whatever he was doing
[46:58] and he was out there and he come in very
[46:59] hungry and
[47:01] and he was willing to trade the
[47:02] birthright for a bowl of soup
[47:04] amen here on the other hand amen jacob
[47:07] would do whatever it took to get the
[47:09] birth right
[47:10] and this is where god would find favor
[47:12] in jacob because
[47:13] jacob wanted more than what he could
[47:15] produce or more than what he could do
[47:17] he wanted what god required and he could
[47:20] do whatever it took to take to get what
[47:23] god required
[47:24] amen so you know he said see what
[47:26] happens is he said
[47:27] first they go along first thing you know
[47:30] the carnal ones begin to think well
[47:32] these guys are getting off the deep end
[47:34] i better separate myself from them and
[47:36] they go back to the intellectual part
[47:38] they want a pastor
[47:40] that'll speak to them pleasant things
[47:41] they don't want a spirit-filled pastor
[47:43] that'll obey the holy spirit from the
[47:45] platform and just preach the word like
[47:48] it is as john said lay the axe to the
[47:50] root of the tree
[47:51] and let the chips fall where it will
[47:52] most of the churches of the day
[47:54] will vote that out of their pulpit
[47:56] that's right but it comes as separation
[47:58] always does
[47:59] it did it in the methodist age it did it
[48:01] in the baptist age it did it in the
[48:02] pentecostal age
[48:04] and it does it every age he said
[48:06] therefore the great church is making
[48:08] itself ready we find out
[48:09] that esau and jacob before either child
[48:12] was born
[48:13] god said he loved one and hated the
[48:15] other they were twins same mother
[48:17] same father twins every revival produces
[48:20] twins
[48:21] there's twins born in a natural man and
[48:23] a spiritual man
[48:25] it was back in the garden of eden cain
[48:27] and abel the same thing started from
[48:28] there
[48:29] and look at the church jesus all the way
[48:31] down he said through the scriptures have
[48:33] been twins all the way down to jesus
[48:35] he said jesus the pastor judas the
[48:37] treasure brothers out of the same tribe
[48:40] out of the same group out of the same
[48:42] church one the pastor
[48:44] won the treasure one a devil one god
[48:47] amen that's the way it goes jesus said
[48:49] in the last days
[48:50] the two spirits would be so close it
[48:53] would deceive
[48:54] the very elected if it was possible
[48:57] amen so twins believer make believer
[49:00] reasoning
[49:01] faith carnal spiritual in our scripture
[49:04] reading we see
[49:04] two approaches to god an approach of
[49:07] wisdom or
[49:08] man's wisdom or intellectual abilities
[49:10] or knowledge
[49:11] a carnal approach i mean a formal
[49:13] approach or the approach of faith a
[49:16] spiritual approach approach with a
[49:18] revelation
[49:19] amen it wasn't their own revelation it
[49:21] was a revelation of christ
[49:23] brother and would say abel was able to
[49:25] look down 2
[49:26] 000 years to the coming of the lamb and
[49:29] realize
[49:30] god is requiring a lamb god is requiring
[49:34] blood
[49:34] god is requiring life he wants more than
[49:37] our just our old dead confessions and
[49:39] our
[49:39] our dead religion god wants something
[49:42] with life inside of it
[49:44] amen he's not coming to i mean what man
[49:47] just speaking naturally what man is
[49:48] going to go marry a dead woman it's not
[49:50] going to happen
[49:51] they want somebody with life in us
[49:53] somebody that amen reciprocate somebody
[49:55] that gives back to them so
[49:57] i mean that is the same with god he's
[49:59] not coming for a dead church
[50:01] he's not coming for dead religions or
[50:03] dead creeds or dead dogmas
[50:05] he is coming for a living breathing amen
[50:08] working
[50:09] supernatural church with supernatural
[50:12] signs
[50:12] with supernatural wonders amen the
[50:15] living god
[50:16] living among them and working through
[50:18] them
[50:19] amen but many people want to put god in
[50:21] a box and he only operates a certain way
[50:24] and he only does certain things and you
[50:26] know and we don't get the holy ghost
[50:27] like they used to and so
[50:29] we get it by believing and all kinds of
[50:31] things they put god in a box but god
[50:33] will go right around your formalism
[50:35] right around your box and move in ways
[50:38] that blows your mind moves in ways it
[50:40] goes beyond
[50:41] what you can think or ask amen i believe
[50:44] in a god who can come beyond
[50:46] our greatest expectations amen and we
[50:49] have seen him moving even among us
[50:51] but he said notice he said when the
[50:53] natural and the spiritual meet
[50:55] there's always a clash
[50:59] it's never failed it always clashes why
[51:01] because
[51:02] in there is a jealousy
[51:06] amen we find that their jealousy it
[51:08] causes it
[51:09] does this jealousy begins to cause
[51:11] carnal imperson
[51:13] impersonations or even carnal
[51:15] comparisons
[51:17] well our church ain't like their church
[51:19] or this ain't like that or
[51:21] you know it's carnal comparisons or this
[51:23] preacher don't preach as good as that
[51:24] preacher
[51:25] or that at carnal comparison he said we
[51:28] find it today
[51:29] as it was then when god does something
[51:31] for an individual
[51:33] everyone wants to try to copy just like
[51:35] god did it for that person
[51:37] and it causes the competition it makes a
[51:39] carnality
[51:40] he said and then if we cannot on the
[51:42] other side get the spiritual results
[51:44] then they'll take it by political power
[51:46] they'll substitute something to upset
[51:48] the people's minds what
[51:50] to do what to draw disciples unto
[51:52] themselves
[51:54] amen that's exactly what took place at
[51:57] the very beginning
[51:58] as cain and abel both boys here on earth
[52:00] when abel offered unto god a more
[52:02] excellent sacrifice
[52:04] than cain and god vindicated it who
[52:07] vindicated it
[52:08] god vindicated it wasn't able
[52:10] vindicating anything
[52:12] god vindicated it amen amen and god
[52:16] vindicated it coming down and received a
[52:18] sacrifice
[52:19] but it caused jealousy with cain because
[52:21] he was jealous of his brother
[52:23] and he slew him it started at the
[52:25] beginning with that natural and
[52:27] spiritual city
[52:28] cain and abel worshiped the same god
[52:31] they built the same kind of altars
[52:33] they both worked as the same god not
[52:35] different gods the same god
[52:37] at the same church same altar but cain
[52:39] by
[52:40] carnal reasoning brought the fruit of
[52:41] the land and laid them upon the altar
[52:44] thinking surely
[52:45] this was the answer for god's atonement
[52:47] he must have brought in what people
[52:48] think today
[52:49] apples or oranges amen what might have
[52:52] took even adam out of the garden in the
[52:54] beginning
[52:54] that's where he was coming by his own
[52:56] intellectual abilities
[52:59] amen but abel had the right sacrifice
[53:02] he knew that it was blood that did it so
[53:05] he brought a lamb
[53:06] and when god received this now abel by
[53:09] faith offered a better sacrifice amen
[53:12] there was no bible written there wasn't
[53:13] nothing given
[53:14] but by revelation he brought it before
[53:18] god
[53:19] and god received it and god is once
[53:23] again
[53:24] not looking for our intellectual
[53:25] abilities or our
[53:27] abilities to speak well our abilities to
[53:29] orientate
[53:30] our abilities to put things together
[53:32] he's looking for spiritual
[53:34] revelation amen that
[53:38] then when you have that in your heart
[53:39] it's more than in this spiritual like
[53:41] revelation
[53:42] is more than a jump or a shout out but
[53:45] when you receive it it might make you
[53:47] jump and shout
[53:48] out and we're talking about the fire of
[53:52] god
[53:52] that comes down upon the altar how many
[53:55] has ever burned been
[53:56] burned by a fire and not had an emotion
[53:58] do it
[54:00] i mean you just go and you kind of burn
[54:02] yourself on a teapot or
[54:03] or one of your sisters getting a pan out
[54:05] of the out of the oven you didn't quite
[54:07] put the mitten on right and you grabbed
[54:08] a hot pan
[54:09] i'm sure like wow that was incredible
[54:11] that was no no there's going to be some
[54:13] emotion to it
[54:15] and how much more greater is the fire of
[54:17] god
[54:18] when it comes inside of a heart that
[54:20] burns out sin and
[54:21] unbelief and all these kind of sins and
[54:24] past mistakes and past
[54:25] problems amen there's some kind of
[54:27] emotion to it when you realize i once
[54:29] was lost
[54:30] but now i'm saved i once was on my way
[54:33] to hell
[54:34] but god and rhythm rich in mercy turn me
[54:37] around
[54:38] [Applause]
[54:41] hallelujah amen you know somebody
[54:43] brother george shared this with me today
[54:45] it was very i thought it was very
[54:46] wonderful
[54:46] somebody asked a man said why does god
[54:49] send a people to hell he said god don't
[54:51] send anybody to hell
[54:53] he said we were on our way to hell
[54:56] every one of us was on our way to hell
[54:58] because we were born in sin and shaped
[55:00] an iniquity
[55:01] but it's by god's grace he put a
[55:03] lifeboat in our way
[55:05] and we have the ability to step off our
[55:07] road and get on that lifeboat
[55:10] amen i realize what i've been saved from
[55:13] what god has done for me in my life
[55:15] and i realize it ain't looking at me and
[55:17] my works and my faults
[55:19] but he provided me a lamb listen it
[55:21] makes me want to shout
[55:23] it makes me want to cry it makes me want
[55:25] to laugh
[55:26] it makes it puts all kind of emotions in
[55:28] me when i realize what god
[55:31] done for me
[55:35] that he came by my way with a lifeboat
[55:42] i wonder how many people you know they
[55:44] say well you know it ain't all of an
[55:45] emotion
[55:46] i wonder about somebody's out on the
[55:48] ocean put that same person out on the
[55:50] ocean somewhere on a little raft
[55:52] and they're just you know floating
[55:53] around for days and they had nothing to
[55:55] drink for days and
[55:56] hallucinating every kind of thing all of
[55:59] a sudden they look out there and here
[56:00] comes a ship
[56:02] [Music]
[56:04] and they're gonna just sit back in their
[56:06] formalism and sit back and like ah well
[56:09] if you know
[56:09] if that's really of god he'd just come
[56:11] right over here and pick me up
[56:16] well i mean you heard the story of a man
[56:18] wanting to be saved you know it was in a
[56:19] flood you heard that story
[56:20] just got reminded of that this week amen
[56:23] wanting to be saved and
[56:25] crying god save me god save me god save
[56:27] me all of a sudden here comes a boat and
[56:29] said come on get in the boat and he said
[56:30] no god's going to save me
[56:33] wouldn't it well god wasn't working in
[56:34] his box in other words
[56:36] and then the helicopter comes along and
[56:38] you know he's crying now god save me
[56:40] he's getting water's getting hired god
[56:41] save me here comes the helicopter drops
[56:43] the lifeline
[56:44] and he and he won't get on the lifeline
[56:46] and and the water comes up and he drowns
[56:48] he goes sees god
[56:49] god said what do you mean i didn't say
[56:51] you tried to save yourself in a boat
[56:52] i sent a helicopter and you refused it
[56:56] all
[56:58] amen got to send things by our way and
[57:01] if you don't get off of where you're
[57:02] going and get on that lifeboat
[57:04] but thank god i took the step how many
[57:07] else here tonight took that step
[57:09] we were all born in sins and shaped in
[57:11] iniquity on our way to hell
[57:13] but a lifeboat come by my way amen the
[57:17] blood of jesus come by my way
[57:19] and it picked me up where he found me
[57:21] but thank god it didn't leave me there
[57:23] it brought me out of there and it set my
[57:26] feet on the king's highway
[57:28] [Applause]
[57:30] no that person in that little thing out
[57:33] there been floating for months and days
[57:35] i just read about somebody survived some
[57:37] like 60 something days out in the ocean
[57:39] i couldn't imagine
[57:42] but i guarantee you when they saw that
[57:44] ship hey
[57:46] [Applause]
[57:47] hey i need saving hey
[57:55] hallelujah and we want to look down on
[57:57] somebody because they get a little
[57:58] emotional
[57:59] they're seeing their lifeboat come by
[58:02] and seeing the holy ghost
[58:03] can be their holy ghost they're saying
[58:05] god can be their god
[58:08] hallelujah just like i told brother
[58:10] linda up there in oklahoma i said now
[58:12] that god
[58:13] that was your daddy's god your uncle's
[58:15] god that god is now your card
[58:18] whoa hallelujah when i realized it ain't
[58:21] just my daddy's god no more
[58:23] it ain't just the church's god or
[58:25] anybody else's god
[58:26] it's my god and did you know it's the
[58:29] same god that helped abraham
[58:31] isaac and jacob it's the same god that
[58:33] walked the children of israel
[58:35] through the red sea through the desert
[58:37] into the prophet that's my god
[58:40] hey that's my god
[58:46] something happens
[58:52] but you see it takes a spiritual
[58:54] revelation
[58:56] of course the devil will be around on
[58:58] your feelings i understand that
[59:00] right but he'll come and he'll come to
[59:03] you after an emotional service and say
[59:05] well
[59:05] that was all emotional but you realized
[59:07] something changed
[59:12] something took place i don't have those
[59:15] same desires no more
[59:17] temptation may be there but the desire
[59:19] ain't there
[59:20] there is a difference between temptation
[59:22] and desires
[59:24] amen it was a revelation he you know
[59:27] he'd come to peter and he'd say
[59:29] you say well who does men say that i am
[59:31] he said well some say your lies some say
[59:33] you're
[59:34] one of the prophets he said well who do
[59:36] you say i am
[59:38] he said i i say you are the christ the
[59:40] son of the living god
[59:42] he said notice a statement that jesus
[59:44] replied blessed art thou simon son of
[59:46] jonah
[59:47] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[59:49] you but my heavenly father has revealed
[59:51] this to you
[59:52] and upon this rock and brother brown
[59:55] said not a church not a religion
[59:57] not peter he said it's upon the
[59:59] revelation
[1:00:00] of who jesus is upon this rock i'll
[1:00:04] build my church
[1:00:05] amen no man he said and he said no man
[1:00:08] could even come to me except my father
[1:00:10] draw nigh
[1:00:11] and he said you have been drawed simon
[1:00:13] and he said no man can cut
[1:00:14] he said flesh and blood's not revealed
[1:00:16] this but i've drawed you into this
[1:00:18] my father which is in heaven has drawed
[1:00:20] you to this moment
[1:00:22] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:00:24] and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:00:26] against it
[1:00:28] hallelujah don't you understand what you
[1:00:30] got inside of you
[1:00:32] you got something that hell can't do
[1:00:33] nothing about
[1:00:35] [Applause]
[1:00:36] amen it didn't say it wouldn't be
[1:00:38] against you it said it wouldn't prevail
[1:00:40] against you
[1:00:41] amen many of you come back from camp or
[1:00:43] services and all hell seems to break
[1:00:45] that's just normal
[1:00:46] amen welcome to being filled with the
[1:00:48] holy ghost every gun in hell has been
[1:00:51] pointed at you
[1:00:52] but greater is he that's in you than he
[1:00:54] that's in the world
[1:00:56] amen when you realize it was more than
[1:00:58] just an emotion
[1:00:59] it was more than just a moment it was
[1:01:02] god that came on the inside of me
[1:01:04] and changed my life forever
[1:01:06] [Applause]
[1:01:07] and it's no longer my fruits and what i
[1:01:10] can do and what i can produce
[1:01:12] it's what he's already done
[1:01:19] but it brings a clash
[1:01:24] we find that clash in abraham and lot we
[1:01:27] find that same clash and moses and
[1:01:29] nathan and cora moses being an ordained
[1:01:32] prophet with the word of the lord
[1:01:33] vindicated
[1:01:35] that he was chosen to be their leader of
[1:01:36] the hour and that abraham had done all
[1:01:39] that he promised
[1:01:40] all these promised things and here moses
[1:01:42] did exactly what god said it would be
[1:01:44] take place in carnal and korah being
[1:01:46] carnal
[1:01:47] wanting to raise up against him he want
[1:01:50] to make a group of men on his own of his
[1:01:52] own
[1:01:54] he said god doesn't deal with people
[1:01:55] like that
[1:01:57] shows you right there in scripture he
[1:01:58] said what takes place
[1:02:00] oh moses you're making too much out of
[1:02:02] yourself you know the whole congregation
[1:02:04] is
[1:02:04] holy you say you're a holy man the whole
[1:02:06] congregations are holy
[1:02:08] we're all holy we're all god's children
[1:02:11] god moses said lord what did i do and
[1:02:13] god says separate yourself
[1:02:16] and he swallowed him up in the earth see
[1:02:18] there was a clash
[1:02:20] when the carnal and the spiritual meet
[1:02:22] there's always a clash
[1:02:24] when judas and jesus met there was a
[1:02:26] clash son of god one son of satan the
[1:02:28] other just like cain and abel
[1:02:30] a clash one of them a treasure the other
[1:02:32] a pastor
[1:02:33] and we come to this day to the same
[1:02:35] thing the carnal denominational
[1:02:38] denomination to the spiritual bride of
[1:02:40] christ
[1:02:41] the spiritual bride of christ is so much
[1:02:44] different from the carnal organization
[1:02:46] until there's no comparison in them at
[1:02:48] all
[1:02:50] hallelujah but we see here
[1:02:56] let me go down here
[1:03:00] we find that that that that
[1:03:03] sorry i lost my spot for a minute we
[1:03:05] find here and if we talk about in second
[1:03:07] timothy
[1:03:09] talk about the last days the church
[1:03:11] would have a form of godliness
[1:03:14] have the form of being a church but deny
[1:03:18] the power what power the same power that
[1:03:21] fell on the day of pentecost
[1:03:24] and we're not moving from that power
[1:03:28] amen that power's been restored in this
[1:03:30] day like never before
[1:03:32] all down to the church ages it went into
[1:03:34] utter darkness but in this day that same
[1:03:36] power
[1:03:37] that same holy ghost that same god is
[1:03:40] now
[1:03:40] living among his people doing the same
[1:03:43] things with same signs same wonders
[1:03:46] same miracles saying we are writing
[1:03:49] another book of acts
[1:03:51] but i know there's a carnal church out
[1:03:52] there that says it ain't so
[1:03:54] it says you only have to believe it to
[1:03:56] be you only have to believe the word
[1:03:58] accept the word for your day you know
[1:03:59] and then you're saved i mean you're
[1:04:01] nothing but a good baptist
[1:04:02] but there is a spirit of god that can
[1:04:05] come on the inside of you
[1:04:07] you say well brother timothy i mean you
[1:04:09] got the mechanics but
[1:04:10] listen we also need the dynamics we get
[1:04:12] it we got the word we got the word we
[1:04:14] got the word but you've also got to have
[1:04:16] the spirit
[1:04:17] amen that makes the word live that
[1:04:20] operates the word in the body
[1:04:21] that changes the hearts and changes life
[1:04:24] the spirit of god that can fall in a
[1:04:26] room and change the whole atmosphere
[1:04:28] to everyone in the building can be
[1:04:29] healed people can be saved
[1:04:31] god can come in such a phenomenal way
[1:04:33] you say really yes god can still do that
[1:04:36] because he's still god it doesn't matter
[1:04:40] how much the carnal impersonation say it
[1:04:42] ain't so
[1:04:48] you know you get a you get a little
[1:04:50] emotional about things you know and you
[1:04:52] get
[1:04:53] the spirit of god moving they won't say
[1:04:55] well you're just pentecost
[1:04:57] i say thank you you're exactly right
[1:05:01] amen i am pentecost
[1:05:06] the original
[1:05:09] amen not the denomination the original
[1:05:12] amen what was the malachi 4
[1:05:14] sent for to turn the faith the hearts of
[1:05:16] the children back to the faith of the
[1:05:18] fathers
[1:05:19] amen we have been turned back to the
[1:05:21] faith of peter back to the faith of paul
[1:05:24] amen back to the faith of the bible back
[1:05:27] to the faith of hebrews 11
[1:05:29] back to the faith of all things are
[1:05:31] possible i don't care how much the
[1:05:33] carnal
[1:05:33] people says it ain't so we have been
[1:05:35] turned back to the faith
[1:05:37] to believe in miracles to believe in
[1:05:40] signs and wonders
[1:05:41] to believe that our prodigals are coming
[1:05:43] home to believe that our children can be
[1:05:45] saved
[1:05:46] to believe that there's still mercy for
[1:05:48] those that desire mercy
[1:05:50] to believe that they're still amen the
[1:05:51] spiritual guard
[1:05:53] to create a spiritual atmosphere that a
[1:05:55] spiritual birth can take place
[1:05:59] listen we're not interested in formal
[1:06:01] dead dogmas
[1:06:02] and mords we're not interested in ice
[1:06:04] cold places called hell
[1:06:10] prison camps death counts
[1:06:13] that's not what we're in that's not
[1:06:15] where we're going
[1:06:18] you know after those ones that wants to
[1:06:20] call us pentecostal because we get a
[1:06:22] little emotional or shout a little bit
[1:06:24] or
[1:06:24] or jump a little bit or maybe because
[1:06:27] we've seen our lifeboat moving through
[1:06:28] the building
[1:06:30] pardon me didn't mean to hurt your
[1:06:32] feelings but what in the world are you a
[1:06:33] methodist
[1:06:37] a good baptist catholic what are you
[1:06:40] if motion makes me a pentecost what does
[1:06:42] no emotion make you
[1:06:48] amen he said but see they have a form of
[1:06:52] godliness
[1:06:53] but deny the power how many people have
[1:06:56] you talked to i just talked to one out
[1:06:58] in the parking lot
[1:06:58] has a form of godliness has a form of
[1:07:01] worship
[1:07:02] has a has a want to go to church as i
[1:07:04] want to even minister
[1:07:05] has a want to do things but they deny
[1:07:08] that god can change a life
[1:07:10] they deny that the holy ghost can come
[1:07:12] in a heart and so change their nature
[1:07:16] to whether they don't want to smoke
[1:07:18] drink corrals do know that again
[1:07:20] but no they don't want that they want
[1:07:22] church and that
[1:07:25] a form of godliness oh they worship
[1:07:28] creeds
[1:07:29] but they deny the power from such turn
[1:07:31] away
[1:07:34] hallelujah for this is the sword to slip
[1:07:36] in from house to house
[1:07:38] and lead silly women and led away with
[1:07:40] divers lust amen never able to learn or
[1:07:42] never able to come to the knowledge of
[1:07:44] the truth
[1:07:45] he said see we got the church formal
[1:07:48] carnal
[1:07:48] believers and we got the church
[1:07:50] spiritual
[1:07:51] born again with signs and wonders by
[1:07:55] spiritual revelation just the same
[1:07:57] as it was in the garden of eden the
[1:07:59] spirit of cain is here
[1:08:01] the spirit of christ is here you have to
[1:08:03] make your choice
[1:08:07] what was cain worship dead worship
[1:08:09] that's right
[1:08:11] it was dead there wasn't no life he
[1:08:13] picked that fruit and as soon as you
[1:08:14] pick a fruit
[1:08:15] from a vine it's dead the life is in
[1:08:18] it's withering away
[1:08:19] it might look beautiful for just a few
[1:08:21] days but you leave it on your
[1:08:22] countertops long enough
[1:08:24] it'll be a stinking rotten mess you
[1:08:26] might
[1:08:27] you might can preserve it for a little
[1:08:28] longer in the refrigerator maybe a
[1:08:30] little longer in the freezer
[1:08:31] but if you allow it it'll rotten to the
[1:08:34] core because it was picked from the vine
[1:08:36] and it has no life and that's what cain
[1:08:38] worship is it don't have life in it
[1:08:41] there are people sitting like dead knots
[1:08:43] on the log there ain't no response to
[1:08:45] the word
[1:08:45] there's no joy in the house of god hey
[1:08:48] man they like i act like they're in a
[1:08:49] prison camp somewhere
[1:08:50] i don't want to act like that i want to
[1:08:52] act like i enjoy being in the presence
[1:08:54] of almighty god
[1:08:56] i want to act like i enjoy drinking from
[1:08:58] the fountains a pentecostal blessing
[1:09:00] i want to pleasure i want to give god
[1:09:02] all the glory when he's lived
[1:09:12] cain worship he wasn't brother brown
[1:09:14] said he wasn't infidel
[1:09:15] he wasn't a communist he was a believer
[1:09:20] he went to god built an altar done a
[1:09:22] very religious thing
[1:09:23] done every religious thing that apple
[1:09:25] abel done but he didn't have spiritual
[1:09:27] revelation of the will of god
[1:09:29] he said there you are he didn't have the
[1:09:31] spiritual revelation that's what's the
[1:09:33] matter with the church
[1:09:34] today he built an altar he worshipped he
[1:09:37] brought sacrifice he knelt down he prays
[1:09:39] he worshiped god he done everything
[1:09:41] religious that abel done
[1:09:43] and god flatly refused him because he
[1:09:46] didn't have a spiritual revelation
[1:09:48] of what god required then
[1:09:51] and from that same line went all the way
[1:09:53] down to the ark he said all the way down
[1:09:56] through israel all the way down through
[1:09:57] jesus all the way down to the dark ages
[1:10:00] until we see it again carnal fundamental
[1:10:02] church stiff
[1:10:04] and starchy
[1:10:07] he knows all the doctrines knows all the
[1:10:10] theologies
[1:10:11] they can explain it all boy just like
[1:10:14] that but without spiritual revelation
[1:10:17] that
[1:10:18] is the doctrine of cain and it's amazing
[1:10:22] who was it was cain
[1:10:23] and jealousy because he seen god
[1:10:25] accepting what they were doing
[1:10:27] and he began to strike out at what god
[1:10:30] was doing listen it wasn't even god he
[1:10:32] listened
[1:10:32] cain was he killed abel but he was
[1:10:34] striking out at god
[1:10:37] and this is why we got to be very
[1:10:39] careful who we strike out against
[1:10:42] you know it was what was one of the
[1:10:44] pharisees in the new in acts he said
[1:10:46] talking about that i believe it was
[1:10:47] about the disciples and things that were
[1:10:49] taking place and he had a very wise
[1:10:50] thing he said
[1:10:51] listen if it be of god let's don't say
[1:10:53] nothing about it
[1:10:54] but if it isn't of god it will come to
[1:10:56] naught
[1:11:01] balaam done the same thing as they come
[1:11:03] through the wilderness
[1:11:06] he said here comes a bunch of what they
[1:11:08] call holy rollers
[1:11:10] a little bit too emotional for balaam
[1:11:14] but what they had listen to what these
[1:11:16] holy rollers had
[1:11:18] these holy rollers they had a spiritual
[1:11:21] revelation
[1:11:22] god was with them they had a pillar of
[1:11:24] fire just reading it from the quotes
[1:11:26] they had a smitten rock they had a brass
[1:11:29] serpent serpent
[1:11:30] they had the pillar of fire and he said
[1:11:33] when i
[1:11:34] think that same god lives with us
[1:11:38] it's still the spiritual revelation of
[1:11:40] the world word he said that spiritual
[1:11:43] church still
[1:11:44] has the pillar of fire among them it
[1:11:47] still has signs and wonders
[1:11:49] it still has the same christ which it
[1:11:52] vindicates
[1:11:52] all the way from the dying lamb to the
[1:11:54] garden of eden unto the second coming of
[1:11:56] the lamb
[1:11:57] absolutely the same yesterday today and
[1:12:00] forever
[1:12:01] and that light of cain religious polish
[1:12:04] scholarly write down the same just the
[1:12:06] same every day the same
[1:12:08] criticizers persecutor this is a quote
[1:12:12] persecutors as k was of able so are they
[1:12:15] today
[1:12:15] and have been and always will be
[1:12:19] carnal unbelievers
[1:12:24] but look at cain and abel both of them
[1:12:26] sincere
[1:12:30] but cain by his wisdom after his mother
[1:12:34] church eve
[1:12:34] like his mother he took reasoning
[1:12:38] how can i build this the way that god
[1:12:40] would be pleased
[1:12:44] he didn't want to get bloody like abel
[1:12:45] did
[1:12:47] he didn't want to he didn't want to get
[1:12:49] drunk like they did on the day of
[1:12:51] pentecost
[1:12:53] he didn't want that he wanted something
[1:12:55] that he could
[1:12:56] you know have a good godly confession
[1:12:59] and and
[1:13:00] you know fulfill his religious duties
[1:13:02] and and leave out
[1:13:04] and go on about his business he didn't
[1:13:07] like the way
[1:13:07] able done his he thought man ain't no
[1:13:09] way that's such a nasty looking thing
[1:13:11] look
[1:13:12] look at that and nobody looked and he
[1:13:13] criticized look at all that nonsense
[1:13:15] they got going on and even like
[1:13:17] tabernacles
[1:13:20] they're just shouting and crying and
[1:13:22] running up and down the aisles and
[1:13:24] waving these white flags they've lost
[1:13:26] their mind
[1:13:30] didn't realize this was what god was
[1:13:32] requiring was this lamb
[1:13:35] and abel was dragging this lamb up and
[1:13:38] it's bleeding and his crying and
[1:13:40] and his uh and he's just looking and
[1:13:42] he's pulling come on and it was his fan
[1:13:44] it was something that was dear to him
[1:13:45] that he laid on the altar
[1:13:48] he tied his feet in his leg and he laid
[1:13:50] it there and he grabbed an old rock and
[1:13:52] he pulled his head back
[1:13:53] and he began to hack at his throat
[1:13:56] listen it wasn't a fun thing i can
[1:13:57] promise you
[1:13:59] i've had to kill some animals in my life
[1:14:00] and i don't ever like it when one of
[1:14:02] them begins to holler
[1:14:03] and begins to scream that's not a fun
[1:14:05] experience to me i don't enjoy that kind
[1:14:07] of thing
[1:14:08] amen i couldn't imagine this hey is this
[1:14:10] the lamb
[1:14:11] [Applause]
[1:14:12] that's how they make that's what kind of
[1:14:14] sound i've heard it
[1:14:16] and blood's trying to start squirting
[1:14:18] out and then kane's like oh my goodness
[1:14:20] they're
[1:14:21] they're he's crazy he's lost his mind
[1:14:26] well that's a that's a mess they got
[1:14:28] going on there
[1:14:29] look at all that nonsense and blood
[1:14:31] starts squirting everywhere
[1:14:33] and and god's looking at oh i'm so
[1:14:35] pleased
[1:14:37] this is what i was wanting this is what
[1:14:39] i desired this is what i'm longing for
[1:14:41] this is what i want
[1:14:43] and cain's over there criticizing and
[1:14:44] doing his that and he's
[1:14:46] making fun and all kinds of stuff
[1:14:48] happening
[1:14:50] come on now blood squirting everywhere
[1:14:54] it's getting all over abel's eyes and
[1:14:56] all down his clothes and
[1:14:57] listen when he left church it looked
[1:14:59] like he'd been to church
[1:15:02] god had changed him god had met him
[1:15:04] there god had done
[1:15:06] something for him amen that's what it
[1:15:09] ought to be when you come to church
[1:15:10] you mean you become part of your
[1:15:12] sacrifice
[1:15:14] that the blood of jesus should come upon
[1:15:16] you and it can wash you and it makes you
[1:15:18] white as snow
[1:15:19] it changes your nature it changes
[1:15:21] everything about you
[1:15:23] and when you leave church it looks like
[1:15:25] you've been to church
[1:15:35] oh beautiful sacrifice you couldn't get
[1:15:37] past the cane
[1:15:38] flowers he had it fruit he had it
[1:15:42] surely god surely in his race surely god
[1:15:44] would accept this
[1:15:49] but see he says see it ain't all he said
[1:15:52] you know the man was sincere because it
[1:15:54] meant life or death to him
[1:15:55] but his brother branham again he said
[1:15:57] them people who don't think they're
[1:15:59] they don't think they're hypocrites
[1:16:00] they're sincere
[1:16:02] then could they be sincere and be wrong
[1:16:04] he said sure
[1:16:06] he said a man could take arsenic
[1:16:08] sincerely thinking he's taking castor
[1:16:10] oil
[1:16:10] or something else he's sincere but it's
[1:16:13] sincerity
[1:16:14] and truth
[1:16:18] it's it's water and blood
[1:16:21] and spirit it's it's spirit and truth
[1:16:26] it's dynamics and mechanics it's
[1:16:29] mechanics and
[1:16:30] dynamics it's a balance
[1:16:35] listen i i agree if if all we get is
[1:16:37] jumping and shouting and carrying on
[1:16:39] and that's all we get it ain't going to
[1:16:40] do us no good
[1:16:42] but when i see lives have been changed i
[1:16:45] see young people they don't even look
[1:16:46] like the same young people
[1:16:48] no more and god's done something for
[1:16:50] them i realized it was more than just a
[1:16:52] drunk
[1:16:53] moment it was more than just a jump or a
[1:16:55] shout but there's a real change on the
[1:16:57] that's what we desire
[1:17:03] cain was bringing what he'd done cain
[1:17:05] was offering what he had grown
[1:17:06] what he'd worked for his own ability his
[1:17:08] own thinking to lay it on the altar to
[1:17:10] die
[1:17:11] not to lay it on the altar to die but to
[1:17:14] put it before god and say look what i've
[1:17:16] done
[1:17:17] look at my wisdom how i've learned to do
[1:17:19] this look at me god
[1:17:21] cain was coming in his own wisdom not
[1:17:24] god's wisdom
[1:17:25] there's a huge huge difference between
[1:17:27] the wisdom of man
[1:17:28] and godly wisdom amen cain was boasting
[1:17:32] in what he had done
[1:17:33] what he had provided that he had
[1:17:35] provided a way of salvation
[1:17:37] but abel was coming not by his own
[1:17:39] wisdom
[1:17:40] abel was coming boasting on what god had
[1:17:43] done
[1:17:44] and what god had provided
[1:17:48] amen but cain by his own wisdom would
[1:17:52] say surely god will accept me
[1:17:55] i've got an altar i've been to church
[1:17:58] i have i've worshiped i i'm
[1:18:01] just i'm sincere i've got a beautiful
[1:18:04] something here and surely god will
[1:18:06] receive it
[1:18:07] that's the same thing the devil told his
[1:18:09] mama the same lie
[1:18:10] same wisdom but in hebrews 11 it said by
[1:18:14] faith abel offered to god a more
[1:18:16] excellent sacrifice
[1:18:17] than that of cain amen a more excellent
[1:18:20] sacrifice how
[1:18:21] by faith not by intellectual wisdom not
[1:18:24] by his own
[1:18:25] understanding or his own reasons but by
[1:18:28] faith in what god required
[1:18:34] amen we're going down
[1:18:40] and he would go brother brown would go
[1:18:41] listen to that it's a wonderful message
[1:18:43] wisdom versus faith
[1:18:45] he talks about the revelation versus the
[1:18:48] botany life
[1:18:50] and the dead versus life and wisdom
[1:18:53] versus faith
[1:18:55] and wyatt had to take blood to bring him
[1:18:57] out of the garden again
[1:18:58] or or to appease god for the sin
[1:19:02] because it was blood that took them out
[1:19:04] it was blood that was going to take us
[1:19:06] back
[1:19:06] in he said how is a man through his own
[1:19:09] wisdom going to understand it
[1:19:10] when the whole bible the whole church of
[1:19:12] god is built upon divine revelation by
[1:19:14] faith
[1:19:15] amen upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:19:19] but see cain religion is dead religion
[1:19:23] able religion revelation is life
[1:19:26] i want to take a few things here for
[1:19:28] those that are formal
[1:19:30] let's help them maybe with their
[1:19:31] formalities when the church
[1:19:33] was inaugurated on the day of pentecost
[1:19:37] it's a very beautiful type of the first
[1:19:39] man of fallen
[1:19:41] they was up there in the upper room and
[1:19:42] one accord and suddenly there came a
[1:19:44] sound from heaven
[1:19:45] like a rushing mighty wind it filled all
[1:19:48] the house where there was setting
[1:19:49] clothing tongues appeared upon them like
[1:19:51] fire
[1:19:52] and they were all filled with the holy
[1:19:53] ghost and out into the street they went
[1:19:56] screaming
[1:19:56] and shouting and going on and all the
[1:19:59] religious
[1:20:00] formal world standing there saying well
[1:20:02] these guys are drunk
[1:20:05] he said they were full of new wine i
[1:20:08] never heard such noise in my life
[1:20:10] he said let me tell you something my
[1:20:12] dear catholic friend
[1:20:15] here let me tell you this today the
[1:20:17] blessed virgin mary was with them
[1:20:21] and if god wouldn't have respect no more
[1:20:25] for the mother of jesus christ
[1:20:26] that she couldn't get to heaven till she
[1:20:28] went there and received the same baptism
[1:20:31] of the holy ghost
[1:20:32] and act the same like a drunk woman how
[1:20:35] much more have you got to have it
[1:20:37] before you can get in there
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:41] oh hallelujah she staggered like she was
[1:20:45] drunk hallelujah
[1:20:47] staggered like a drunk person he said
[1:20:49] have you ever heard a drunk saying
[1:20:51] oh everything's just fine now be not
[1:20:53] drunk upon strong drink this is what
[1:20:55] they're saying
[1:20:56] but be drunk on the spirit that's what
[1:20:59] we need today
[1:21:00] that's what we need today that's what we
[1:21:03] need today
[1:21:04] is an old-fashioned drunken baptism of
[1:21:06] the holy ghost
[1:21:08] that burns out sin an old-time
[1:21:11] backwood sky blue sin killing religion
[1:21:15] hallelujah
[1:21:18] what the world needs today it's an
[1:21:20] old-fashioned saint paul's revival
[1:21:22] the bible holy ghost back in the church
[1:21:24] again that's what's the matter with the
[1:21:26] church today
[1:21:27] the reason is so formal and indifference
[1:21:33] amen
[1:21:37] the formal church looked at him and said
[1:21:39] well what do we have to do to receive
[1:21:41] this
[1:21:42] peter would tell them they're they're
[1:21:43] not drunk as you suppose
[1:21:45] this is only the third hour of the day
[1:21:48] but this
[1:21:48] is that that the prophet joel spoke
[1:21:50] about this is a fulfilling of scriptures
[1:21:53] that's taking place
[1:21:54] he said what have we got to do he said
[1:21:56] repent
[1:21:57] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:22:00] name of jesus christ
[1:22:01] for the remission of your sins and you
[1:22:03] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:22:08] he said see what has happened he said
[1:22:10] they went in
[1:22:12] and they got some of that original
[1:22:13] manner
[1:22:15] and he said and it's coming this day he
[1:22:18] said we have the same right
[1:22:20] to go in and get some of that same
[1:22:22] original manner
[1:22:24] that fell on the day of pentecost it
[1:22:26] ain't a hold over religion
[1:22:28] it's a whole jew religion amen it ain't
[1:22:31] a make-believe religion
[1:22:33] it's a religion that'll change your life
[1:22:35] change your thinking change your
[1:22:37] thoughts change everything about you
[1:22:39] change how you think about god and about
[1:22:42] church and about the
[1:22:43] uh the movement of the spirit it'll
[1:22:45] change everything
[1:22:46] if you get a good dose of this kind of
[1:22:48] holy ghost
[1:22:57] just up at those meetings in oklahoma
[1:23:00] we had an outbreak of the holy ghost
[1:23:04] girls drunk in the spirit laid out on
[1:23:06] the floor
[1:23:07] one of them happened to be my daughter
[1:23:10] katie
[1:23:12] i'd actually preached that night and
[1:23:14] went when i thought the service was just
[1:23:16] going to kind of end on a
[1:23:18] high note is shouting and praising god
[1:23:20] in worship so
[1:23:21] i went on back to my room to get get a
[1:23:23] shower real quick and come back
[1:23:25] and i came back and there was a prayer
[1:23:27] line out the door and around the
[1:23:28] building nearly
[1:23:30] and i'm like wow what's going on this is
[1:23:33] nearly an hour later my daughter's still
[1:23:35] over there in the floor and
[1:23:36] her and sister jamai and a couple others
[1:23:39] was there
[1:23:40] and i walked up to the uh
[1:23:44] to the door i went around toward the
[1:23:47] side i could get
[1:23:48] the decide i could easily access her
[1:23:50] because i wanted to go
[1:23:51] see what was all happening walked to the
[1:23:54] door and there's his brother standing
[1:23:55] there and i said
[1:23:56] brother what's happening here we got a
[1:23:58] drinking party going on
[1:24:00] he said he said i don't know this is
[1:24:02] quite amazing
[1:24:04] i said well let me go in there and i
[1:24:06] walked in there and i sat down by katie
[1:24:09] began to talk to her and pray for her
[1:24:12] she was drunk she didn't know where she
[1:24:15] was she didn't hardly know who she was
[1:24:19] finally got a hold of her and staggered
[1:24:21] her up to a pew behind us and sat down
[1:24:23] and
[1:24:24] put my arm around her and just crying
[1:24:26] and praying i thought boy
[1:24:27] if i don't get out of here it's going to
[1:24:28] get on me too
[1:24:31] and i'm going to be back out there on
[1:24:32] the floor with all the rest of them
[1:24:34] you just feel the power of god moving
[1:24:38] i said what's happened to you katie she
[1:24:40] said i don't know but i sure like it
[1:24:44] and i don't want it to ever end
[1:24:48] and she said a lot more drunker than i
[1:24:50] just said it
[1:24:51] so her mom came up and i prayed with her
[1:24:53] and later over there
[1:24:55] i began to walk out the building made it
[1:24:57] out the room and
[1:24:58] brother lemuel pruitt run out behind me
[1:25:01] and he said uncle timothy
[1:25:02] he said i got to get baptized i got to
[1:25:04] get baptized i got to get baptized i
[1:25:05] said what
[1:25:06] what do you got to get baptized for and
[1:25:08] i'm trying to remember is he ever been
[1:25:09] baptized you know
[1:25:10] it's trying to thought kind of things
[1:25:12] i'm trying to figure it out and he's
[1:25:13] just such deprived
[1:25:14] desperation that gripped him got to get
[1:25:16] baptized
[1:25:18] and i said well what do you want to be
[1:25:19] baptized for he said because i want that
[1:25:21] holy ghost
[1:25:23] i want god to change my life i gotta
[1:25:25] have it i'm not leaving here without it
[1:25:26] i said well you don't have to be
[1:25:28] baptized to get it
[1:25:29] you can get it and be baptized i laid
[1:25:32] hands on that boy and he went
[1:25:33] instantly drunk instantly drunk and
[1:25:37] laid him down in the chair somebody
[1:25:39] brought we prayed with him for a while
[1:25:41] and he began to scream out at that
[1:25:42] moment oh god you're my god
[1:25:46] you've come and touched me now i see
[1:25:48] it's real i see you've touched me and
[1:25:50] changed my heart
[1:25:51] you're my god
[1:25:56] hallelujah
[1:26:00] god still gives that kind of experience
[1:26:03] [Applause]
[1:26:05] there's still tongues in the church
[1:26:11] i know the carnal people want to cut it
[1:26:12] out but that's it's still right here in
[1:26:14] the word
[1:26:19] makes them feel uncomfortable but it's
[1:26:20] still here
[1:26:22] what's happened is their mana got old
[1:26:26] got termites in it bugs in it broken
[1:26:29] cisterns their waters run out all over
[1:26:30] the place
[1:26:32] why because they let their experience
[1:26:34] dry up
[1:26:38] there become nothing but stagnated pools
[1:26:45] but he said every person has a right
[1:26:49] to go back and get them a handful of
[1:26:51] that same
[1:26:52] original manner that fell on the day of
[1:26:56] pentecost
[1:26:57] it'll have the same works it'll have the
[1:26:59] same manifestations
[1:27:00] it'll have the same power it'll have the
[1:27:03] same evidence
[1:27:04] this is the prophet of god say
[1:27:06] everything that they got on pentecost we
[1:27:08] can have today
[1:27:09] not something like it the same thing
[1:27:15] oh hallelujah he said those fellows back
[1:27:17] under that old omar
[1:27:19] they didn't have to get something that
[1:27:20] looked like it they got the original
[1:27:23] he said i'm glad today that we can get
[1:27:25] the original
[1:27:26] baptism of the holy ghost powers signs
[1:27:29] wonders say miracles why is it it's the
[1:27:32] same
[1:27:33] resurrected lord jesus christ
[1:27:36] it's the same god moving among us
[1:27:44] he said it's not what it's another place
[1:27:46] this is not what i
[1:27:47] am or who i am it's the perfection of
[1:27:49] jesus christ and god that died in my
[1:27:51] place
[1:27:52] to make me what i am he said it isn't
[1:27:55] whether i can stand
[1:27:56] it's whether he stood oh i love that
[1:28:00] brother that would make a baptist shout
[1:28:02] out
[1:28:05] wow so apparently brother branham even
[1:28:08] believed in baptist shouting
[1:28:10] amen there's something about it that's
[1:28:12] real he said i believe
[1:28:14] and shout him i believe in that
[1:28:15] old-fashioned religion
[1:28:17] that's what's the matter today they say
[1:28:19] your religion is too much emotion
[1:28:21] he said i can prove to you
[1:28:22] scientifically anything that hasn't got
[1:28:25] emotion
[1:28:25] is dead so if your religion hasn't got a
[1:28:30] little emotion in it
[1:28:31] you better just bury it for it's dead
[1:28:33] yes sir if a baby's born and it doesn't
[1:28:35] cry
[1:28:36] or do something the baby's dead
[1:28:39] we got too many dead born babies in
[1:28:41] church
[1:28:44] some of our message churches wouldn't
[1:28:45] like the prophet of god preaching for
[1:28:47] we got too many dead born babies born in
[1:28:50] our church
[1:28:50] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:28:52] it doesn't understand it hasn't never
[1:28:54] come to life
[1:28:55] you know what they do with a little baby
[1:28:57] when it's born if doctor picks him up
[1:28:59] and gives him a little posterior
[1:29:00] protoplasma stimulation he wakes him up
[1:29:03] right quick and he goes to squallin
[1:29:05] he said if there's anything the
[1:29:07] pentecostal church needs tonight
[1:29:09] it's a good old-fashioned gospel
[1:29:11] spanking to wake them up
[1:29:13] to wake them up the little thing get
[1:29:15] some of the starch out of them
[1:29:19] get some of the starch out of them
[1:29:22] he said you brother branham you're
[1:29:23] holding a meeting down there and then
[1:29:24] people are screaming and carrying on
[1:29:26] said yes sir he said don't you think
[1:29:28] that's fanaticism no sir
[1:29:32] so it reminds me one time he had a great
[1:29:34] night a farmer had this great nice farm
[1:29:38] beautiful farm nice tractors beautiful
[1:29:41] barns
[1:29:42] but he was just too lazy to farm
[1:29:45] let his place grow up in weeds
[1:29:49] wouldn't put up no hay wouldn't put up
[1:29:52] the feed
[1:29:53] too lazy yeah at all he had the
[1:29:55] beautiful tractor he had a beautiful
[1:29:57] barn
[1:29:58] but he had all the weeds no food
[1:30:02] and all he could do was look over at the
[1:30:03] other farmer
[1:30:05] other fellow lived over by him didn't
[1:30:06] have much of a place
[1:30:08] barnes maybe not too good but he was a
[1:30:10] real industrious smart worker
[1:30:13] he got out and he planted alfalfa and
[1:30:15] clover
[1:30:17] he said reminds us some of us has got
[1:30:19] big churches but that hasn't got nothing
[1:30:21] in it
[1:30:23] sometimes you get a little mission
[1:30:24] sometimes you got a lot more
[1:30:26] than you find in some of these big
[1:30:27] morgues around here
[1:30:29] he said you talk about hollering and
[1:30:30] caring brother on brother brother you
[1:30:32] don't even know the first principle of
[1:30:34] it
[1:30:35] that's what he's talking back to that
[1:30:36] guy he said in the barn of the farmer
[1:30:38] with the weeds in his loft to feed
[1:30:40] there was this little calf born and over
[1:30:43] on the other side and the old shaggy
[1:30:45] barn was this little calf bar
[1:30:47] born they both were fed through the
[1:30:49] winter and springtime come out
[1:30:51] and the farmer that had plenty of food
[1:30:53] to feed his calf he turned him out in
[1:30:54] the crowd when he did
[1:30:56] that calf was all fat and sassy you know
[1:30:58] when that spring wind blowed a little
[1:31:00] bit and boy he felt good
[1:31:02] and he went to kicking up his heels and
[1:31:03] the way he went
[1:31:06] and that man with that big fine ritzy
[1:31:08] polished up barn throughout
[1:31:09] his little calf out poor little fella so
[1:31:12] weak and couldn't hardly move
[1:31:14] he said he staggered out over that fine
[1:31:16] concrete floor peeped out through the
[1:31:18] little crack in that website oh
[1:31:20] that was me through the crack in that
[1:31:23] fence
[1:31:24] and watch that little calf feeling good
[1:31:26] kicking up in his heels it's a
[1:31:28] such fanaticism
[1:31:31] he said what's the matter he was hungry
[1:31:34] and he couldn't do that
[1:31:40] mercy instead of those preachers looking
[1:31:42] at us and saying
[1:31:44] fanaticism they ought to give their
[1:31:45] people something to eat so they got
[1:31:47] something to jump about
[1:31:48] and shout about and give god glory about
[1:31:51] won't you open up your bible and feed
[1:31:53] them something
[1:31:54] of the holy ghost give them something
[1:31:56] that'll give them spiritual strength
[1:31:58] and do season give them something
[1:32:00] that'll fight the devil that'll give
[1:32:02] them strength to stand toe-to-toe
[1:32:04] with that devil and say no devil you're
[1:32:06] not coming past here
[1:32:07] i rebuke you in the name of jesus
[1:32:16] he said you may have to worship in a cow
[1:32:19] barn
[1:32:20] but as long as you got spiritual
[1:32:22] vitamins
[1:32:24] as long as you got something to eat
[1:32:26] that's what makes you
[1:32:27] kick up the heels
[1:32:31] and act the way you do the holy spirit
[1:32:34] coming and confirming his word
[1:32:35] god promised it he gave it to us he said
[1:32:38] to abraham he was going to give him the
[1:32:40] promise
[1:32:40] abraham believed god and god told him if
[1:32:43] you notice
[1:32:44] went on to 100 years maybe got worse his
[1:32:47] strength was going on
[1:32:48] but that didn't keep him he just come
[1:32:50] over to god said look abraham
[1:32:52] your strength is gone just come on over
[1:32:54] to me i got something for you
[1:32:56] el shaddai the breasted one amen the way
[1:32:59] amen two sides to him
[1:33:01] healing and salvation and he brought it
[1:33:03] he said i'll satisfy you
[1:33:05] and i'll bring you back to strength
[1:33:07] again that you can fulfill my word
[1:33:11] i'll give you something to shout about
[1:33:14] i'll give you something that'll bring
[1:33:16] forth life
[1:33:18] then you won't have to criticize you
[1:33:21] have something with life in it
[1:33:28] another place about 50 years ago
[1:33:32] on this through the streets in
[1:33:33] california a bunch of people worshiping
[1:33:35] god
[1:33:36] so the method that methodism had gotten
[1:33:39] so formal and different that they didn't
[1:33:41] want none of what was called
[1:33:42] what they call fanaticism what they call
[1:33:45] fanaticism
[1:33:46] no shouting no amen no nothing in the
[1:33:49] church
[1:33:52] they thought that education and
[1:33:53] reformation would reform the people to a
[1:33:55] place that they didn't need that stuff
[1:33:56] no more
[1:33:58] this is where we get people are trying
[1:33:59] to reform people into being a christian
[1:34:03] more no more than an alcohol anonymous
[1:34:06] trying to just give them a little
[1:34:07] something that you know i understand you
[1:34:10] you had a little problem but if you'll
[1:34:11] do this 10-step program then you'll be
[1:34:13] okay
[1:34:14] know what you need is the holy ghost
[1:34:18] so let me tell you my friends education
[1:34:20] is good as it may be reformation as good
[1:34:22] as it may be
[1:34:23] will never never
[1:34:26] take the place of the baptism of the
[1:34:28] holy spirit
[1:34:29] it's god's eternal plan to seal his
[1:34:32] church away
[1:34:34] oh my
[1:34:37] another one talking about that calf
[1:34:39] again
[1:34:41] he said see what was wrong i going down
[1:34:43] he said he was starved
[1:34:45] on denominational weeds
[1:34:49] what we need is some holy ghost vitamins
[1:34:51] in the church
[1:34:52] that'll renew the youth
[1:34:55] it'll renew the youth of the church take
[1:34:59] it back to pentecost again
[1:35:04] take it back to pentecost again and
[1:35:06] bring you over with an experience
[1:35:09] fattened up he said that's what's the
[1:35:12] matter we're putting too much
[1:35:14] on our buildings and claiming jesus is
[1:35:16] coming we're doing this and doing that
[1:35:18] he said we got all kind of our
[1:35:19] intellectual knowledges what we ought to
[1:35:20] do is be on the job
[1:35:22] out getting somebody in there saving
[1:35:24] souls feeding them god's vitamins
[1:35:26] through the power of god that's exactly
[1:35:28] right amen just like the little calf
[1:35:30] come out of the stove just as fat and
[1:35:32] round kicking his heels out
[1:35:34] the other one's so poor poor he could
[1:35:35] hardly move and if the wind would blow
[1:35:37] it blow him over sideways
[1:35:39] he's seen that old fat calf of having
[1:35:41] such a good time
[1:35:42] such such fanaticism he said but when a
[1:35:45] man is filled with the holy ghost
[1:35:47] there's something in him that's full of
[1:35:49] god's spiritual vitamins
[1:35:50] it makes him praise god it makes him
[1:35:53] shout
[1:35:54] it makes him act different he's no
[1:35:56] longer earthbound
[1:35:57] he's heaven bound he's

[1:36:20] her husband
[1:36:22] she'll take a dog or a cat or something
[1:36:25] she's got to mother something
[1:36:26] it's a nature so a church is going to
[1:36:30] try to produce something
[1:36:33] but we're not to try to we're not to
[1:36:35] produce
[1:36:36] something that's not of god we're to
[1:36:38] produce god's seed
[1:36:41] the sun amen with the promise of the sun
[1:36:44] as
[1:36:44] abraham and sarah would but it's got and
[1:36:47] so this mother knows it's in her
[1:36:48] her nature is to produce something so
[1:36:51] instead of doing what god called her to
[1:36:53] do
[1:36:53] she's going to go manufacture something
[1:36:55] get her a dog love on it a cat live on
[1:36:57] it
[1:36:58] never seen such in my life anyway i'm
[1:37:01] going
[1:37:01] and to bear a child but to bear a child
[1:37:03] for a husband
[1:37:05] and raise it to the service of god
[1:37:06] that's entirely out of her line
[1:37:08] she should oh but she'll be disgraced if
[1:37:11] she did
[1:37:12] by our sin-loving society of this 1965
[1:37:16] type of woman
[1:37:18] a true picture of the modern church
[1:37:20] today he says neither does the modern
[1:37:23] church want any of these here screaming
[1:37:25] shouting tongue speaking acts 2 38
[1:37:28] youngins around her
[1:37:31] she don't want over there any of them
[1:37:32] whooping and crying and screaming
[1:37:34] amen hallelujah why such a child would
[1:37:37] immediately put her out of her
[1:37:38] denomination
[1:37:39] they had well you said brother timothy
[1:37:42] where are the messages we ain't part of
[1:37:43] the nomination well then what's your
[1:37:45] problem what you worried about
[1:37:48] hey man why such a child would be would
[1:37:51] immediately put her out of her
[1:37:52] nomination
[1:37:53] they had one like that in one of the
[1:37:55] churches while they'd throw her out real
[1:37:56] quick
[1:37:57] why are you letting such stuff like this
[1:37:58] go along oh so you see she's pregnant
[1:38:01] with something because she's going to
[1:38:02] bring forth
[1:38:03] members all the time but you don't want
[1:38:06] none
[1:38:07] of them screaming hollering blabbering
[1:38:09] acts 2 38
[1:38:10] miserable creatures that she thinks they
[1:38:13] are
[1:38:14] it would certainly embarrass her it
[1:38:16] would ruin her
[1:38:17] and her educated ethical scientific
[1:38:20] society church
[1:38:21] that she belongs to they would throw her
[1:38:23] out but my she can't have it
[1:38:25] she don't want to be pregnant with the
[1:38:27] word because that's the only kind
[1:38:30] the word can bring forth
[1:38:34] hello somebody you say well what year

[1:39:08] you find old-fashioned
[1:39:10] sanctified holy ghost-filled child born
[1:39:13] of the spirit of god
[1:39:14] screaming hollering shouting praising
[1:39:17] god
[1:39:18] that all together out there adam's out
[1:39:20] of reach for that church
[1:39:21] but not for the church of the living god

[1:40:02] the same powers
[1:40:03] and the same wonders and the same holy
[1:40:06] ghost
[1:40:06] and the same miracles and the same signs
[1:40:10] hallelujah we saw this past weekend i
[1:40:13] mean miracle take place after miracle
[1:40:15] after miracle
[1:40:16] god moving in his children god touching
[1:40:19] hearts we saw a blood disease that was
[1:40:21] healed
[1:40:22] amen we saw a eczema that was healed
[1:40:26] some trouble that was healed all kind of
[1:40:28] other testimonies that are coming out of
[1:40:29] it
[1:40:30] god moving in a miraculous why because
[1:40:32] we're back to seed again
[1:40:34] with the same holy ghost as back in the
[1:40:36] church again and that same holy ghost
[1:40:38] has the same power
[1:40:40] over every sickness it has the same
[1:40:42] power over every sin
[1:40:43] it has the power over every devil in
[1:40:45] hell amen we saw how many pornography
[1:40:48] devils
[1:40:48] have to bow at the name of jesus and be
[1:40:51] driven out of lives amen
[1:40:52] they might have thought they had to live
[1:40:54] with it but when god became their god
[1:40:56] they really i don't have to live with
[1:40:58] that thing no more i'm free from that
[1:41:01] and we saw the same holy ghost give the
[1:41:04] same liberty
[1:41:05] that it did on the day of pentecost
[1:41:06] we're seeing the same holy ghost
[1:41:08] amen raise the dead among us
[1:41:12] it's the same power and it'll produce
[1:41:15] the same effects no matter what the
[1:41:18] spirit of formalism wants to say
[1:41:22] let's bow our hands
[1:41:38] he said and you accept you receive the
[1:41:41] same spiritual revelation
[1:41:44] you'll always call these people holy
[1:41:47] rollers
[1:41:49] fanatics
[1:41:53] always making fun
[1:41:59] mercy two spirits
[1:42:04] two twins where do you find yourself
[1:42:06] tonight
[1:42:13] we're looking at a church that's doing
[1:42:14] the greater works
[1:42:19] cancers are being healed every spirit of
[1:42:23] hell's being driven out
[1:42:25] young people overcoming baptized with
[1:42:28] the holy ghost
[1:42:30] that's what we're seeing lives change
[1:42:33] forever
[1:42:34] that's what we're seeing and people want
[1:42:38] to say that's fanaticism i'll take it
[1:42:45] i'll receive it
[1:42:50] i'll receive what he promised
[1:42:53] if you don't go i'll go
[1:43:01] probably seemed pretty crazy for rebecca
[1:43:03] to believe all the things that was in
[1:43:05] store for her
[1:43:08] but she had to come to his decision i
[1:43:10] would go
[1:43:18] god's
[1:43:23] moving in the miraculous realms
[1:43:30] they brother timothy i don't know
[1:43:34] i don't know about all that
[1:43:38] well i know right in the middle of a
[1:43:39] woman sitting on the side of a bed
[1:43:43] thinking about her problems and had that
[1:43:46] brain bleed
[1:43:49] all of a sudden her mind began to change
[1:43:53] she began to realize that god had been
[1:43:54] so good to her
[1:43:56] done some wonderful things
[1:44:00] and she started lifting up her hands and
[1:44:02] praising god and shouting and
[1:44:04] thanking him for sparing her life
[1:44:08] and the lord must have been pleased with
[1:44:09] it
[1:44:11] because right out of the middle of that
[1:44:12] floor step stood up this little 18 month
[1:44:15] old baby
[1:44:16] never walked or crawled and began to run
[1:44:19] all over the house
[1:44:20] doctor says he was going to have to have
[1:44:21] maybe surgery is this that another
[1:44:23] because of undeveloped
[1:44:24] underdeveloped hip but god came in that
[1:44:27] moment and healed him
[1:44:31] not only did he do that he restored
[1:44:34] my mama's eyesight back to her
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:41] right in the middle of praising him and
[1:44:44] thanking him
[1:44:46] there's nothing wrong when praising him
[1:44:48] [Music]
[1:44:52] what why do they want to take that from
[1:44:54] us
[1:44:56] i got every right to praise him
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:00] he'd done some wonderful things for me
[1:45:03] he ain't done nothing for you maybe you
[1:45:05] can just sit on your hands or whatever
[1:45:06] you want to do
[1:45:08] i don't see i don't see how that's
[1:45:10] possible
[1:45:12] he's giving you the opportunity to hear
[1:45:14] the truth that's enough to praise him
[1:45:17] about
[1:45:20] he passed the lifeboat by your way
[1:45:23] he said jump in you don't have to go
[1:45:25] that way that's enough to praise him
[1:45:28] about
[1:45:30] hallelujah
[1:45:34] thank you jesus we don't have to be
[1:45:37] ashamed of what god's done for us
[1:45:39] and what god's doing in our midst i'm
[1:45:41] not ashamed
[1:45:44] i can't tell you how many tears and
[1:45:45] rejoicing i've
[1:45:47] went back and watched last wednesday of
[1:45:49] god moving in
[1:45:51] a mighty way that's nothing to be
[1:45:54] ashamed about
[1:45:56] that's something to be thankful about
[1:45:59] that the spirit of god would feel
[1:46:00] pleased to drop in our midst
[1:46:03] and let us wave the white flag of
[1:46:05] victory
[1:46:06] [Music]
[1:46:07] and not only that we saw the black flags
[1:46:10] of satan fall at our feet
[1:46:12] [Music]
