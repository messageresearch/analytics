[0:00] tonight we're going to be speaking about
[0:02] healing divine healing in the lord's
[0:05] supper now god has an attitude towards
[0:08] sickness and he showed that attitude in
[0:10] jesus christ
[0:12] now jesus told us to cast out demons of
[0:15] afflictions he did not tell us to live
[0:17] with them
[0:19] amen and since sickness is a demon it
[0:21] doesn't glorify god you ever hear of a
[0:24] demon glorifying god
[0:26] no so it doesn't glorify god for us to
[0:28] live with demons
[0:30] jesus commissioned us to cast them out
[0:34] that is the work the principle work of
[0:37] the church is to cast satan out
[0:40] amen now there are two basic parts to
[0:43] the communion we have right here before
[0:46] us and there are two parts to it there
[0:48] is the bread there is the wine and of
[0:50] course for the passover there were two
[0:52] parts of the passover there was the lamb
[0:56] and the body of the lamb there was to be
[0:58] a lamb slain
[1:00] its blood was to be applied
[1:02] to the doorposts of every house
[1:05] it was to identify them
[1:08] as being under god's covenant of
[1:11] protection
[1:13] god said the blood shall be for you for
[1:15] a token
[1:16] where you are and when i see the blood
[1:20] i will pass over you
[1:21] how many remembers that
[1:23] amen and the plague shall not come upon
[1:26] you to destroy you you see this
[1:28] represents in type our identification by
[1:32] faith
[1:33] with the blood of jesus christ the lamb
[1:37] so now we're being justified by faith by
[1:41] his blood we are saved from the wrath
[1:43] that is to come
[1:45] amen so that's number one but number two
[1:48] second thing is every israelite had to
[1:51] eat the lamb's flesh
[1:55] amen
[1:56] and this was for a different reason this
[1:58] was not for protection from sin
[2:01] nor the death angel
[2:02] this was
[2:04] for physical strength
[2:06] for the journey
[2:10] eating the lamb was for physical
[2:12] strength amen for physical strength if
[2:15] the deliverance from slavery then meant
[2:18] healing for the body also did delivery
[2:21] tonight from the slavery of sin must
[2:24] provide for healing also
[2:27] you can't have one without the other
[2:30] amen if you've got if you got the wine
[2:33] you got to have the bread to go with it
[2:35] if you got the blood of the lamb you got
[2:37] to have the body of the lamb to go with
[2:39] it
[2:40] so you see there has to be divine
[2:43] healing that is included in the promise
[2:48] now
[2:49] if it was in the passover then
[2:52] and we now have a greater lamb and a
[2:54] greater passover
[2:56] then healing must be provided
[2:58] in this passover
[3:03] eating the lamb's flesh had nothing to
[3:05] do with the passing of the destroyer
[3:08] the blood was the sign of the token
[3:10] when i see the blood
[3:12] i'll pass over you you see the destroyer
[3:15] had no authority to touch that house
[3:19] amen
[3:20] israel was beginning a journey and as
[3:23] they started that journey which is a
[3:24] type of our own christian journey
[3:27] amen god planned that his children for
[3:30] that journey would be well and to be
[3:32] strong for this journey and i want you
[3:35] to know tonight that's still god's plan
[3:38] god wants you to be well god wants you
[3:42] to be healthy god wants a people that
[3:45] believes his word and proclaims that
[3:47] word for our own healing and deliverance
[3:51] it's god's desire for you said third
[3:53] john 1 and 2 said beloved i wish above
[3:56] all things that might prosper and be in
[3:58] health even as our soul prospers
[4:01] god wants you
[4:03] to be well
[4:06] it's the wrong thinking god wants you to
[4:08] suffer
[4:09] god wants you to be healed
[4:12] amen so while this is for god's glory it
[4:15] might result in god's glory
[4:17] but god don't get any glory out of you
[4:19] being sick
[4:21] god gets glory when you're healed
[4:24] when he was took those stripes
[4:27] when he was beat on the head with a rod
[4:32] amen for everyone that had a headache
[4:35] or that has a headache or is troubled
[4:37] with headaches
[4:39] are you here tonight amen jesus took the
[4:43] beatings on his head and received
[4:45] headaches
[4:47] in your stead
[4:51] so that you could be healed
[4:53] you say i've got back pain he took
[4:55] stripes on his back
[4:57] so that your back could be healed
[5:00] you say i've got footprints he took the
[5:03] nails in his feet
[5:05] so that by what he suffered at calvary
[5:09] you can be free from the sickness that
[5:12] wants to come against your body for by
[5:15] whose stripes we were healed
