sure to be imprisoned and beaten just for preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and so he has appealed his case but unfortunately the cases they the courts are all closed so it's really going to take a miracle for him not to be deported and and it's a very very situation bad situation also there are those that are in the other type of prison and chains maybe it's a sickness in their body our brother Ron Spencer still needs a touch some of the Lord and we're believing for him our brother Vernon winters the last report I got he was in the hospital and I was talking about doing further surgery so

Lord if we're in the moments of being down or saddened Lord that you would just come in comfort I pray Lord that you would just come and touch each and every life those Lord are streaming tonight Lord and the situations the sicknesses Lord that abound seemingly on every hand Lord but God we know that you're still here among us and you're still with us father we just ask you to reach down and touch us Lord and in the homes and the different places we ask it for your glory and for your honor Lord those that are in the hospital those that have needs father than the body and sicknesses there reach down and touch them I pray father we commit them into your hands for your glory and for your honor in Jesus name Amen let's turn to Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 says and I will restore to you the years that the locusts had eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the Palma worm my great army which I sent among you and ye shall eat him plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel and not it that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the hands made in those days well I pour out my spirit and I'll show wonders in the heaven and the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke and the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance as the Lord has said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call amen we'll let you be seated this evening I'd like to speak to you out of these couple of verses where's in back-to-back verses I believe it mentions this and my people shall never be ashamed people shall never be ashamed this word a shame means to be put to shame or to be concerted disconcerted which is unsettled or to be disappointed in other words with him you'll never leave disappointed but God had come and meets you and whatever needs you have need of and also and Paul would speak about this you would say as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone or rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed this is the same word shall not be disappointed or be disconcerted or unsettled now it does not mean you won't have unsettling times but in those uncertain times you can be certainly ma'am and in Jesus would even use this when he would say in John chapter 3 and verse 18 he said he that believeth on him is not condemned as condemned is speaking of coming into judgment but also to come into judgment to be unsettled it's along the same word to be put to shame or to be disappointed you know there's gonna be many that will come into judgment I'm glad I'm not one of those or not pointed appointed to that place but they will come to that moment and though they may feel like they got it all handled they may feel like they got it all figured out they realize they've become that moment very ashamed or disconcerted or unsettling no doubt in that in the time of judgment but he said he because he said he that believeth not is condemned already this word condemned is what the word I'm speaking about an unsettled or be ashamed because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God and this is the condemnation that the light has come into the world and the men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that death evil hated the light neither cometh the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that does truth he that doeth truth cometh the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God so amen so we're speaking of this as we look into the scripture here in Joel as he's talking about all the things that had happened the enemy had come this great army the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the parma worm and had stripped all the bark off all the leaves off and and left the plant in a very shameful condition or is very shameful place and brother brandon would speak about this and equate it or bring it as call according to what the church had become how the enemy had come down through the dark ages and stripped off the power of God but the Holy Spirit was once again in this hour released to the church again to bring it back to what it was at the beginning amen and so all that had been taken off or all that had been lost or all that had been stripped away was brought back amen the shame that had been brought was now taken away the reproach was taken away and she was placed back in her rightful position or a rightful place amen and you know I believe that there's a people here upon this earth that that don't have to be ashamed of the God that they serve or don't have to be ashamed of the worship to the worship that they give to the God that they serve you know the lamb you know the world that we live in there definitely don't seem to have any shame on them when they serve the gods of of different men's ideas or man's own doings and they give their bodies that give their soul they give their mind they give their money and there seems to be no shame to that you know they they do everything they can the worship that God and I believe this is a piece but we can come to the house of God or wherever at tonight and we don't have to have any shame and how we worship or who we are how what God has called us to be in this hour amen and we don't have to be unsettled than that God has called a people to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen and I believe all those things have been restored to the church again I believe prayer has been restored I believe they men worship has been restored I believe all these things has been lost down through the ages it's back in the body again and we don't have to be ashamed of what God does among us or how God operates among us or how God sees fit to operate among us amen amen we're going to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen so you know when you come to him you know brother Branham would talk about how about this disappointment you know sometimes you face disappointments in your life and we all have disappointments we we have times of disappointments times of uncertainties and brother Brandon would speak about a man who would come a man into a prayer line and he said one limb was about two inches or three inches shorter than the other one and he wore a high shoe one of those big built-up shoes and he said but he brought him a new pair of shoes and he brought it to the meetin so he could wear that new pair home and he says God will never disappoint anybody with that kind of faith and I believe we can be that kind of people that have that kind of faith to believe that God's going to do what he said he would do and I don't have to be ashamed about Amen it may be a month it may be two months maybe two years ten years but God's gonna do what he said he was going to do and I don't have to be ashamed about it it's not my reproach it's not my word I don't have to worry about it God spoke it God to bring it to pass now we may face times of disappointments and no doubt you know there's been a lot of memes and things about year 2020 and you had a lot of plans and little things and things seemingly it turned upside-down and times of uncertainty but we are to be certain in uncertain times or in times of uncertainty and and recounting some of the sermons that we've heard we are to have an expectation of no matter what the situation William that should not change our expectation of God it was a good year or bad year it does not change our expectation of God and His Word Amen of times around us and things around us are good or they're bad that should not change our expectation amen and God is going to fulfill what he said it would do God is going to have a bride without spot without wrinkle God's going to have a person or a people Amen in full bloom in full authority and for a men to use the Word of God turn and her disposal as we heard Sunday God's going to have that kind of people upon this earth and I don't have to be ashamed about it amen so and we're also to hold the line amen when things are coming and things are pushing us and and we're being pushed similar whatever just hold the line faith has a resting place and this resting place is not dependent upon governments this resting place is not dependent upon the government is good to you or bad to you if the month is good to you're bad to you this is not the resting place this is an eternal resting place and eternal resting places are not or eternal things or not they are not affected by amen temporal things hallelujah place has an eternal resting place and so when all hell breaks loose we won't be ashamed when the doctor comes in and with the reason report we won't be ashamed when it seems like all hope is gone and it seems impossible we won't be ashamed God is going to move and when he moves he moves God is going to restore what the enemy has taken away hallelujah seems he's taking all your hope seems he's taking all your desires but we will not be ashamed God will restore it all back gonna bring it back to new again man what cancers ADA way here restore what sugar diabetes has taken away here restore whatever diseases Rob from you he will restore he is the restorer even what the old has done to you old age has done to you he will restore what's in Rob from you he will restore and we will not be ashamed and faith anchors in the unfailing Word of God hallelujah and an unfailing word with a reality of a Living God so we should expect God to move we should expect not to fulfill his word amen our expectations should not be less it should be more Amen in times of difficulties we ought to be expecting more not less more in times of uncertainty we ought to be expecting more and we let our faith anchor in its eternal resting place and you won't be ashamed it don't mean you want me to have disappointments you won't have times of disappointments and things nor notes we've had plenty I'm already this year but we don't be ashamed we're not ashamed God's still gonna fulfill his word I'm still gonna bring things to pass you know the Sarah Phoenician woman you know had come to Jesus and she was trying to get to him and you know she had a lot of things she had to get through you know and brother bana would say he said faith find sources that others don't see when she heard she believed she might have heard of a neighbor's girl being healed of epilepsy ur which a child had or they might have heard of an epileptic being healed somewhere our daughter too had need of healing but she just heard Jesus could do it see her Jesus could do it so she wanted to give him a chance to do it hey man so amen our faith has got to stay there to give him a chance I mean her faith has got to hold the line to give him a chance amen so he said you know he said he for he was God's Word made flesh in the beginning was the word and the word was god and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever he was there to reveal the promises of God for his and he is here tonight to vindicate and reveal the promises of God made for this age he is here to do it he was in the days of the prophets he was with Moses he was with David he was with Elijah he was with the rest of them the reveal God's promise of that age what God had promised he brought to pass and in this day he's here to do the same but he's just looking for somebody that can that's heard he can do it hallelujah and she believed this no matter how much people didn't believe it she believed it anyway because faith finds a source that other people know nothing about I don't know you when a man has got faith in God he's got a hold of something that he can't explain it's something he's got ahold of he can't push it shove it pull it it just takes him right to where God is that's the way faith is when a man's really got faith in God it finds a source that others can't see his word as a sword is word is sharper and it goes right down into the thoughts and intents of the heart a man who saw her she came right there right there to Jesus she had many hindrances but her faith in have any see faith don't Hatton had knows no hindrance faith knows no hindrance she had her faith she had hindrances but her faith didn't have any hallelujah she had disappointments but her faith didn't have disappointments she has reasons to doubt but her faith held on there was plenty of reasons to give up Lord oh she got to him and no how would he told her I didn't come to you amen listen this is and we you may have hindrances but if you've got faith it knows no defeat it's positive no matter how negative it gets come on somebody it's positive no how about how negative gifts just look at some of our hinders just for a moment some of them might have said remember you're of a different race you're a Greek a Sarah Phoenician he's a you he don't even come to hear your denomination that's nothing to do with this the woman didn't care whose denomination it was she was a human being being been that had been created by God and she had a need and she had faith and she was going to get her need Hollander that's all we gotta have I'm a human being created by God and God said he's going to restore God told me he's going to restore what the cankerworm and this one took from in that took God said he would whether a denomination was cooperating and not made her no difference she didn't she wasn't worried about that she might have come to another critic might have made her down the line and said well don't you know days of miracles are past we don't have miracles no more that could have been a Jew after she got in there's this country Jesus was in you know saying days of miracles are past there's no such a thing but she just kept moving on her faith just kept pushing her own amen just going right on beyond the disappointments right on beyond all of that right on beyond that she didn't have to be ashamed hallelujah he said if you can only hold that in your heart that God is here to give you the desires of your heart and when you meet his conditions nothing can stand against that hallelujah there might have been a bunch of women come to and say now look sister my name's Lydia sister Lydia Everwood her name would have been do you understand that your husband won't leave you if you do this no doubt but it's what she loved her husband but she couldn't courser bless that which was in her something was telling her daughter was dying with epilepsy she had to get to Jesus and when she got there something was going to take place husband or no husband no hallelujah Amen husband or no husband friends or no friend church or no church I get to Jesus God's gonna do something something some of them might have said well you know you do this as afflictive town what if it fails what's going to do what's going to happen she knew it wasn't gonna fail something was in her told her it can't fail if he ever was God he still remains God he can't fell therefore she just kept moving Oh hallelujah can't move and then some of them might have said well the circle you belong to in this society they'll laugh at you laugh or no laugh hey what no difference to her friend or no friend no difference husband or no husband no difference something was on the inside of her she kept moving some of them might have said well you put then you put them put you out of your church put out or not put out she kept moving she was on a road something was pulling her to Jesus oh maybe that's what's going on with you tonight something on the inside it's pulling you a certain direction and it's moving you to who to Jesus who can move on the scene for you and change it in a moment and a twinkling of an eye and restore you back to what you were nothing was sinning away there wouldn't you I'm gonna put up with hindrance and finally she arrived to where he was many people think just because you get to where he's at it's all over he said he can come in this building tonight and show himself alive he said that's not right he said that's wrong he can come in this building tonight and show himself alive after 2,000 years by the things he promised he would do in this day he did it last night he does it every night he does it everywhere he proves he's still alive and you can come into this presence but that's not isn't it sometimes you meet difficult when you come into his presence sometimes you meet a difficulty when you come right to the moment he said when she arrived she said to Jesus then said Jesus to her I'm not even sent to your race the very one she came believing in turned her down he said now that's a lesson right there she went through all these gates of sorrows and disappointments and and problems and this one but something pulsating inside of her telling her to go and we she got there he turned her down and besides that he said her race was nothing but a bunch of dogs mercy it's not meat for me to take what's the children's bread and feed it to the dogs he said what if he'd had called you that a dog he said I don't know what what would happen if he'd call the pentecostal the dog or if you'd have said Methodist dogs or Baptist dogs my opinion he says went back and told the pastor he was right after all there wasn't nothing to this fella you know that's what they would say if you got a hold something but if he but if you got a hold something's gonna hold you no matter what certain and uncertain times I'm not sent to you race of dogs not me for me to take the children's bread and give it to you I'm not sick your revival your company you know I'm not sent to you it isn't meat for me my time for you is not now it isn't my time for you why should I waste my time on you good Lance what a disappointment what a timesheet it's okay I got here I went through all that and he says he what he came he won't do it what a disappointment I would have been to the woman that didn't have faith hello did you gets that what a disappointment it would have been to a woman that didn't have faith that wasn't determined he said oh if the church could only see that that no matter what faith is still there no matter if it looks like he's turned around faith is still there no matter if it looks like it's not gonna happen in my generation it's not going to happen faith is still there no matter if it looks like I'm just going to go down into a gray faith is still there no matter if it looks like the case is hopeless and it's impossible and it's impossible to happen the doctor says it ain't gonna happen this one says that ain't gonna happen this one says and it's impossible faith is still there what was the difference he said brother Brennan said she wasn't a hothouse plant it had to be babied and sprayed and keep the bugs off a good healthy plant you don't have to spray at a good healthy plant the bug can't get to its full of health and he said a good born-again faith in God a real genuine Holy Ghost faith nothing is going to turn it down I mean he's got some good Holy Ghost faith nothing is going to turn it down a man is going to go anyhow she wasn't a hybrid you know hybrids they they breed this one is this one it and they get weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker might get a better looking grain might look all prettier but it's and they can't reproduce nothing it's just dead as midnight that's what I hope she was she was a real seed and he goes on he says see so does a Jinyu I'm born to Kris born-again Christian know where he's from he knows his origin wasn't John Wesley or Luther or that or anybody else it began on the day of Pentecost when God Himself came to his people that's the faith he's looking for that faith when God Himself came into his people a man he made his work manifest and it hears the word and it'll say a man the woman wasn't a hybrid plant she got a hold of something you didn't have to baby her you have to spray her and say now darling please let me beg you to do right let me beg you to do everything tried to hinder I but a real Christian fights for his position fights he has to stand alone sometimes seemingly him and himself and then him and God but he'll fight every so you don't have to baby him around he just holds their winds of hell or blowing and he's staying there see my God has turned around and he's staying there seem like it's impossible but he's staying there this is why I said blessed is he that knocks and keeps on knocking six and keeps on seeking askins keeps on asking he doesn't matter if you've been turned down a hundred time ask again if he knocked a hundred times knock a hundred one time and say God I'm here and your word says this your word says I'm healed and therefore I'm waiting on you to move on my behalf and you won't be ashamed faith always amidst the word is right this is what she did what did she do when he said I wasn't even sent to your race to the dogs what did she do she admitted he was right she said yes Lord faith always missed the word is right he says if your faith don't punctuate every word of God with an a man there's something wrong with your experience the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever if you don't say amen to that then something is wrong the work but Jesus said the works that I do show you do say tell you do also me don't say a man to that sand something's wrong if it don't punctuate every word every promise within a man there's something wrong she admitted she was right he was right she admitted she wasn't nothing but a dog she admitted that she was there but even you're right Lord but even the dogs get the crumbs and if all I can get a crumb tonight I'm gonna get a crime hallelujah cuz I know what a crumb will do just a little movement just a little movement of fears will rewrite everything he said what he said mind what would happen what a difference she was put back shut back now put aside put outside she just kept on going something on the insider told her she was gonna get it regardless of how long she had to wait she was after the crumbs yes the dogs eat the crumbs on the master's table that's the way to do it we're not we don't have to take a high seat take the backseat just get a seat and let God move that's the way it is he that humbles himself shall be exalted shall be exalted you won't be ashamed but if you exalt yourself you'll be a base that's a shame and the way up is down hey man she's never seen a miracle she was a Gentile but she had faith she had something along the lines of what Ray I've had had faith Rahab didn't say well wait I see how Joshua combs his hair how the generals look or what the swords look like or what kind of thing but she said I've heard that your God is with you and I've heard of what he even can do and that's good enough for me I want mercy and she being called it out for a man this is what God had done for her you may be a dog but I want to crumb I want what you have for me whatever you see whatever you call me Lord yes your word is true but I want it faith omits the word is right you know we had a little family Martha and Mary who ashamed they've become friends with Jesus close the brothers Lazarus get sick and they'd called for him and people were watching and looking and seeing well surely here come you know to be be he's friends he'll be here to help he's helped this when he's helped that when he's helped the beggar over here surely come help his friends and next thing you know Lazarus dies and one day next day in June it seemed like more and more shame is being hooked heaped upon the family and it seemed like impossible and getting more and more impossible Lazarus now deteriorating in the gray noses dropped in flesh just fell off his bones dead and here comes Jesus walking up what happened when he came corruption knew his master the sole newest creator four days journey somewhere didn't matter there was a voice that could speak and bring him right back again he was a man a man sure Jesus being a man came off the mountain hungry can't come down looking for a tree cutting something off of fruit of a tree it wasn't there he cursed that he was a man when he's hungry but he took five biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000 he was a man when he laden the ship on the back of their sick tired from preaching all day long healing the sick Burt you out of it but he was more than a man when those Devils tried to drown him and he stepped up on the BAS savelic bow that boat it said peace be still and the winds and the waves went down - wasn't even a ripple he was a more than a man and here he come walking up to Martha Martha feeling the shame of the eyes upon her and feeling all the things around in the mocking and making fun oh sure God's really for you sure God really is he Jesus is really your friend look what he did he's left to your brothers in the gray remember me if you believe and you hold on he said and those that believe in him will not be ashamed and here he come walking to the grave and Martha said yes Lord I believe you are the resurrection of life but even now even now in the middle it seems to Fargo but even now what was it faith had found an anchor in place somewhere and it wasn't dependent upon a good day or bad air four days five days ten days one week whatever he wasn't dependent upon that he was dependent upon who was standing in front of her and here she is even now she found something to hold on to in the middle of her storm the shunammite warm in the same way shame right in the middle of it this baby that the Lord had spoke for her dies don't you know the mouth and the things that went on around her and the mocking and the making fun shame but he says whosoever believeth in me shall not be ashamed as we said Martha shamed her shame tried to come disappointment I just thought he would come thought it would be here by now we sent word somebody come up and knock on the door here have you have you sent for Jesus yeah we sent for Jesus well where is he I thought he loves you I thought he cares for you I thought he knows about your burden huh I thought he knew about things and I thought he could tell they even know when you're going through something when when nobody's even told me he supposedly read the thoughts of the Pharisees and they said you know all kind of mocking and making fun just like they're doing today the time we're living in they're mocking ah slow as the second coming of Christ and we shall world where it's hidden they're setting up things now it's going to be very easy Amen to persecute that anybody that has any kind of form of Christianity and you see with the persecution that's being set up for the foolish virgins you can see it being all put into place they're mocking and they're making fun and they're trying to bring shame on his name when he said whoever believeth in me shall never never it didn't say on a certain day or good days or you
