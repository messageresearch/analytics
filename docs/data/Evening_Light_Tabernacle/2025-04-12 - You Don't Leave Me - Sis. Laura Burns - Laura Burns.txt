TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'm in the desert. No water, no shelter, no cover. Waiting for a rescue to come. But I never had to question or wonder about the heart of my father. After seeing all the great things you've done, I know you're going to finish what you begun. You don't lead me just to leave me. What if the promised land is just up ahead? I'm not forsen in these wastelands. So, Father, don't let me forget. You don't leave me. No, you don't leave me. I'm feeling fear and burdened and lonely and hurt. You leave me right here in my pain. And I feel you holding my head up. My portion is filled up, showing me that you're the God who stays. You don't need me just to leave me. What if the promised land is just up ahead? I'm not forsen in the wasteland. So, Father, don't let me forget. You don't leave me. Oh, you don't leave me. Oh, and you're faithful to your promises. Faithful like you've always been. I can trust that you will be again and again. I'm grateful that you're here with me. Grateful that you're going to be walking with me to the end. You don't leave me. No. You don't leave me. No. No, you don't need me just to leave me. What if the promised land is just up ahead? I'm not forsen. Oh, in these wastelands. So, Father, don't let me forget. You don't leave me. You don't leave me. No, you don't leave me. [Applause]
