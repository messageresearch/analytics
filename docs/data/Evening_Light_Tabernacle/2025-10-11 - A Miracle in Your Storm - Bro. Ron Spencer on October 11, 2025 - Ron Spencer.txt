As a blackness of night, close off the light. My heart sank with fear. My desperate cry rang out with pride. And all I could see was no hope inside. But gone, I met the one who came looking for me. He came looking for me. Oh, he came looking for me. Oh, he made a way. There was no way that I could see. Oh, I drifted so far, but Jesus was near to rescue my soul and calm all my fears from my heart. Cuz I met the one who came looking for me. Now, Satan had already picked out my grave. His plan had to put me away. Would anyone would anyone care that I'd soon be lost? But listen, I knew my destruction was a matter of time. But Jesus appeared and said, "This one is mine. Now I'm safe from all harm." When he walked through the storm, came looking for me. Now sing it with me. He came looking for me. [Music] He came looking for me.

It can't stand against you. &gt;&gt; We are more than conquerors to him that loved us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, what God's looking for in this hour is somebody that'll believe him. &gt;&gt; Somebody that take him at his word. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to do that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just thinking of something that I want to share with you from the prophet of God before we pray over the request. Jesus is the sweetest name I know. Brother Bradom said that healing it is a finished work. Christ did it on Calvary. And if he can only come into your heart and open your heart till you can see the finished work, it's finished when you accept it. Salvation is the same. If there's power to heal a man, there's power to save a man. Man was both saved and healed when Christ died at Calvary. For he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed. Therefore, that little door, that's faith. Now, listen to this. You say, "Oh, I'll give it a try." Faith doesn't try. Oh, blessed be his name. Faith knows where he's standing. Faith has got big muscles and a hairy chest. And when he stands and raises up his big muscles, everything contrary sets down. He lets out a scream and it sounds like a panther screaming and every jack rabbit takes to his den. Faith is the boss. All things are possible to them that believe all things. Or you say, I might ask God too much, brother Brandham. You can't ask him enough. He loves to do it for you. Could you imagine a little fish a half inch long out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean saying, "Well, I better drink of this waters apparently, I might run out someday." That would be nonsense. And it would be more nonsense to think you could ever exhaust the father's goodwill to do things for you. Could you imagine a little mouse about so long under the great garners of Egypt saying, "Now just a moment. There's only 450 billion tons in this garner. So maybe I better eat just one grain a day cuz I might run out in the springtime." Of course, that's the way some Christians think God is trying to allowance yourself. just join the church, just doing this, or I just do the best I can. If you do the best you can, you'll believe every promise God made that is for you. You can never ask him too much. He loves to give it to you. Ask that your abundance that your joys might be full. Just ask for great things and believe for great things. How many's ready to believe for great things? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe God's got great things in store for us. He's got healing, deliverance, salvation, everything, every promise in the book. We're not living in a day and an hour where there's seals on the book. The book has been unsealed. The mysteries have been revealed. The whole land of the promise is open to us. Every promise in the book is yours tonight. You can have it. Hallelujah. We're going to speak the name of Jesus. We're going to believe for you tonight for the needs that you have in your life. Our brother Sherman Thomas is sick tonight. Wasn't able to come to church. We had prayer last night for brother Buster Wiggins. We continue to pray for him. I'm sure there's needs here. Will you stand with me and let's just if you got a need to God, just raise your hand right now as I pray. Father, in the name of Jesus, the name of Jesus is higher than all names. For at the name of Jesus, every knee has to bow and every tongue confess that you are Lord, your Lord over every sickness, disease, problem, situation. And I'm asking in the name of Jesus, oh God, that every knee tonight will bow to that name, knowing and believing that the word is true, then sickness has to bow. Death has to give way. Cancer has to leave. Oh God, your promises are ours tonight. And they are yes and they are amen. I speak healing tonight over this congregation. I don't care what a condition that it is. If it's a physical need, a spiritual need, a financial need, you are our God and you're able to supply all our needs according to your riches and glory. So we ask that you would do it now. Touch our brothers, Lord, that we've mentioned tonight. The hands went across this congregation. May you just bless them with your healing touch in Jesus name. Amen. Tonight, as we come to this service, I'm very honored to have with us our brother Ron Spencer. Brother Ron is loved by all of us, people across the world, and pray for him daily. Been over five years ago, the doctors told him he wouldn't live by four months. Gave him four months to live. He's defied all odds. But you know what it's been? It isn't because of medication. The medicine's actually killing him. But I tell you what, it's been because of the power of the living God. He's alive today. A testimony of the grace of God. I just think about just um some time ago, brother Donnie Reagan and I who also loves Brother Ron very much and we love Brother Donnie and he met us there with to pray with Brother Ron who had cancer now in both eyes after getting in the lungs and then go into the brain and then and then now would come into his eyes And they would say that was going to have to take his eye out and then treat the other with chemo. Tried to to save his life. And he would suffer with blindness. A complete removal of the eye. Went through all of the specialist test. I was there. I was there. I was present when he got the call and they were telling him all the procedures what they would do. I was with him in that moment. We sat down and to eat breakfast together. I just arrived and we had prayer together and talk with him. Those of you that are full from full gospel lighthouse, brother Donnie preached a wonderful message inspired our faith and then I preached on a sermon called the hour has come because we had reached a very critical hour. You know, something had to be done here. You know, he was facing the removal of an eye and chemo in the other and loss of vision and all of this. It was very dire situation. But you know, as we prayed with him that day and the Holy Spirit just came down and he would go back to the doctor and just following up on the treatments to to to follow up and they would go through, yeah, the cancer's there. Send him to another doctor. Yes, this is what the procedure to do. Yes, we see it there. And they go to the next one and to the next one. come down to the very last one. And he looks at all the reports and he says looked in the eye and he said, "No, no cancer. It's all gone. We've made a mistake. That's all. We just made a misdiagnosis. We know. We know what God did." Amen. We saw the hand of God. The hour had come for deliverance. I want you to know we are at a critical hour. There there is trouble in our land. There's trouble in politics. There's trouble in government. There's trouble in the world. And we are in a very very critical hour. And the hour has come. And it's come and it requires somebody who believe God's promise. Somebody that'll put faith into action. You know, it's great to come and agree with the word, but you've got to put it in action in your life. Faith is an action word. I said that last night. You've got to put it into action. We must believe. If there was ever a time for us to step out in faith, it's right now, this hour, this time to believe for your miracle. Last night, we heard from the Lord. God spoke to us directly and I I just I just trust that you know he's writing in your life a new story rewriting from the sorrows, the troubles of the past. That you can hear from God tonight and through this message that your future is clear. There's a rapture ahead for you. You're not just going to make it. You've already made it because we've read the end of the book and we know we are more than overcomers. We are the conquerors. God bless you. As our brother Ron comes tonight, I want you just to open your heart to the Lord and let God speak to you. Let him minister you in a special way. Jesus is the sweetest name I know. Oh, what a lovely name. And he's just the same as his lovely name. Can you say that tonight? That's the reason why I love him so [Music] far Jesus is the sweetest name I know. Can you raise your hand to God right now and sing it one more time? Where my Jesus is. the sweetest name I know. There's just no one like you, Lord. And he's just the same as his lovely name. And that's the reason why I love him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it one more time. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. the sweetest name I know. And he's just the same as his name. [Music] And that's the reason why I love him so [Music] Jesus is the sweetest name. [Music] Hallelujah. Isn't he wonderful? He is so wonderful to us and I'm so honored to stand here before you again. And so many of you I know and got new friends with us and so glad to see you and meet you and and so glad to have so many friends from home and we love you. What a wonderful meeting already. Amen. Brother Andrew on Thursday night and then last night I I just I actually asked him if he would go ahead and speak tonight. And so Amen. What a wonderful time. Amen. We so love you with all of our hearts and so thank you for your prayers. You know when brother Tim was speaking of those things, they're true. We were there. We lived it. Sister Connie and I walked down about an 80 foot aisle way and going to the last doctor knowing what they were getting ready to do. Our hearts was just tore apart. And when we got to the end of that hunt there and we met with the doctor and he said, "I'll see you in a year." I said, "Okay." He said, "You're good." So we called him back in and said, "We've been told we've got cancer." He said, "Well, it was a misunderstanding." I like misunderstandings. Don't you? [Applause] We were just with a team of doctors and I'll share this will be my first time to share it but we had our brain uh MRI and and uh for those that don't know I've been suffering from brain u stage four brain and lung cancer and and uh got a brain MRI and and so they they brought us then said it was clear, which means there's no big cancer working and and so we continue the chemo every day and and so he was he's been a real friendly doctor, wonderful doctor to me and I always get a good hug from him and and uh he's the kind of guy that's just so caring and so he gave me all the legal jargon and all the things to say and he cut off his recorder and he said, "Uh, Ron, I'd like to talk to you a bit." He said, "We have we have teams of doctors from all over the world come and we talk about this brain cancer that you you've got." And he said, "Um, I would like to ask you." He said, "We've never did this before, but we don't we've never had one like you." And he he said, "I'd like for you to start coming to our meetings." and and uh be a representative for us. [Music] I'd like to be God's testimony. Don't you? I like it with all of our hearts. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. It ain't good to us. That doesn't mean that there's not bad days and not a lot of sickness and not a lot lot of all of that. But no matter your trial, he'll bring you through it. He'll absolutely bring you through it. I'm glad to have my chief nurse with us today and and she's such a trooper and sister Connie. So glad to have her with us. Amen. [Music] I so love the songs tonight because they seem to line up perfectly. God orchestrates everything. And so, Amen. If you will turn with me to Luke chapter 8 and verse 41. Amen. Luke chapter 8 and verse for 41. I'd like to just talk to you a little bit about a miracle in your storm. Every one of us are going to have some storms. Every one of us are going to have a storms. But I'm a Christian, brother Ron. You're going to have some storms. The difference is he's going to be with you. Whether you feel like he's a million miles away or you feel like he's carrying you, he's with you. It's not based on your feelings. It's based on the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you can always look back after your past your storm and you're looking at your rainbow and say, "Without God, I would not have made it through it." And I can say after 5 years without God I would not have made it through it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke chapter 8 and verse 41. And behold there came a man named Jarius. And he was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at Jesus's feet and besought him that he would come into his house. for he had only one one only daughter about 12 years of age and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thawned him and a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which had spent all of her living upon physicians neither could be healed healed of any. came before him and touched the border of his garments. And immediately her issue of blood staunched. And Jesus said, "Who touched me?" And when all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, "Master, the multitude throng thee, and press thee, and sayest thou, who touched me?" And Jesus said, "Somebody hath touched me, for I perceived that virtue is gone from me." And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling and falling down before him, and declared unto him, and before all the people that for what cause that she had touched him, and how that she was healed immediately. And he said unto her, "Daughter, be of good comfort. Thy faith hath made thee whole. Go in peace." Maybe you have a need tonight and God has arranged this service for you and you would like him to speak to you. You've been going through some trials. You say, "Lord, I need you. It's all right to be dead honest with God and say, "God, I can't do this on my own. I need you. Could you just raise your hands before the Lord now? Father, I so love you with all my heart. All of us as ministers stand here tonight and know without you, we can't do anything. But I'm so amazed that how that you can take the lips of man and inspire him with the word of God and you can go to situations in lives and we can walk out of this building a complete different person. Now father may our faith reach to a different realm tonight. Help us. Help us to look past our storm just for a moment. Now I ask you that you'd minister to every hand that has went up. I too have need. I pray that you'd strengthen us in a special way. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen and amen. God bless you. You may be seated. I just want to remind you that every miracle before every miracle there's a mess. &gt;&gt; Every miracle has a moment to where the things begin to change. We understand that and and this is just a simple principle that you have to know as a Christian. You can't worry and pray at the same time. You can't worry. That has no virtue in it whatsoever. &gt;&gt; It's actually anti-faith. &gt;&gt; You can't worry and pray at the same time. Now, sometimes we realize our miracle has happened and and we can step forth and rejoice and praise and then there's other times that the miracle takes place and we begin to walk and we realize that I don't have that condition no more. &gt;&gt; We walk in faith. We talk in faith. Our confession begins to build. We understand. We understand that our life is orchestrated of God. God pre-plans our life. He watches over us. We've heard it the last couple of nights how God that is always with us. We make choices a lot of times that doesn't please him very well, but he don't throw us away. &gt;&gt; Uh we make choices that later in our lives we will regret. But we look at a constant God that has always been with us, that has taken care of us, that's been there to provide for us, to watch over us, and in our ignorance, he still loved us. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe maybe your miracle has been even hundreds of years in the making. DNA that you've carried since your birth, situations of your life that has taken place, but you have a divine appointment. Maybe tonight you have a divine appointment. Sister Carne and I have spent thousands and thousands of hours in doctor's offices. And if you've been to a doctor's office lately, they're they're not they're not necessarily on your time, &gt;&gt; they're on their time. &gt;&gt; And there's times that you have to wait for hours. Sister Connie is quite a patient person. And let me just drop this here. She has taken me to to the clinics two and three times a week. And sometimes the clinic starts at 9:00 in the morning, sometimes 6:00 in the morning, and sometimes it's dark in the evening before we leave. To this day, she's never complained one time. &gt;&gt; That's a miracle. That's a miracle. God bless sister Connie. &gt;&gt; Now, we we understand through the scriptures that there's been a lot of messes or a lot of situations that look totally impossible to take place. Let me just go through a couple just for a moment. Sarah was barren. &gt;&gt; Not just a few days, but nine decades. &gt;&gt; And we talk about what a phenomenal miracle that happened in her life, but nine decades she suffered with being barren. &gt;&gt; Job had phenomenal amount of things that took place. Isaac when it comes toward the end of his life and a blessing has happened we don't understand everything but Isaac becomes blind &gt;&gt; he would have never picked Jacob but God has to allow blindness are you with me &gt;&gt; he has to allow blindness to happen to where now I I I don't know everything I'm not going to stand here and try to explain everything but he would have never picked Jacob Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego we heard about last night. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. They had a quick trial. &gt;&gt; They had to stand in a moment. They had to they had to act and have faith on the word of God. There was a man named Blad Barnabas that suffered his entire life, but he had a moment. Lazarus was Jesus's friend, &gt;&gt; but no doubt there was some complaining by his neighbors. If Jesus was your friend, where's he at right now? &gt;&gt; Then they begin to call for Jesus and Jesus didn't come. &gt;&gt; But there was a plan. &gt;&gt; They didn't get a letter from the government saying, "Hey, Jesus is on a mission &gt;&gt; and it's all going to be all right." Listen, he had to die. &gt;&gt; They had to roll a stone in front of him because the appointment with Jesus was after the stone was laid. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So everything is orchestrated of God in our lives. &gt;&gt; We all have difficulties and situations. Tonight in this meeting, there's two people that I'd like to just share with a little testimony with you. And I so love brother Tim's meeting meeting on Sunday and and uh he told us he said you got to tell these stories they got to be real and just keep keep the fire alive. Keep an upto-date story of Jesus Christ. No, we're not trying to be brother Brandham but God works in our lives. &gt;&gt; He works in your lives &gt;&gt; in the building. This is the first time that in a meeting that I've had these two and and so I I'll just I just want to share this with you. We have a brother Marcus. Brother Marcus, I I haven't found you yet. Brother Marcus, are you here? Would you stand up for us? There we are. Could you just keep standing for a moment? I'm going to be standing for a while. Brother Marcus and myself had not known one another up until 22 years ago. I was going home from a meeting like here and uh when I got to the air airport uh they told me said uh your plane has been cancelled and and uh you're probably not going to get home. And I begged them to I said whatever you got to do I I got to get home. And so they actually switched uh even the one one air air to another airport and they put me on a they put me on a plane. They put me at a window seat and and there was a guy that was sitting beside him and he was a jabber box. I was wore out. I was in a wet suit from preaching and I thought, "Oh jeez, this guy talked. We about two and a half hours in flight, maybe more than that." And this guy just rattled off. And you know, we were getting ready to land and you know, you're coming in to land and uh and and he asked me, he said, 'What do you do? My first chance to talk. What do you do? And I said, "Well, I'm a preacher." And I have a long time to speak to him and and I wore out and and he said, "What do you do?" I said, "Well, I'm a preacher." And I said, "I I preach the message of William Brham." Brother Marcus was sitting on the aisle and he'd been looking at a magazine the whole time. He just kind of had his arms on his legs and he'd been he'd been looking at this magazine just flipping pages and and you could just tell he was bored out of his mind and and he said, "I grew up in the message." And he told me two different stories for me to identify that he had grew up in the message. plane landed. They got off of the flight and I said, "Well, maybe they'll wait for me. I'd like to meet him, shake his hand, pray with him, whatever." And he told me while I was on the plane, he said, "My life is devastated." He said, "I'm out of the church." He said, he said, "I I I think he said, "I'm divorced. I I I I I've got a great job, but my life is just just destroyed." Well, I told that story in a lot of meetings looking for him. 18 years went by and some people from North Carolina, some of you are here, came to begin to come to our church and we had a fellowship to where that we could I could get to meet them. And and so I I walked through the parking lot with brother Marcus. I didn't know who he was. And we walked in and we just did small talk. We sat down. I think we had pizza. And we're sitting there now. I've I've said I I'd like to meet that man again. I'd like to be able to lead him to Christ. I'd like to to get him sat round settled in life. I I'd like to I'd like to become a buddy to him. I'd look for him for all these 18 years. And I'm sitting there at the table and the Lord whispers in my ear, "The man you've been looking for is sitting beside of you, &gt;&gt; brother. I don't know if I believe that." Well, what if I was wrong? &gt;&gt; And I looked at him and I said, "You and I have met before." And he just quickly said, "No, no, we haven't met before. And he was just quick. He was quick to brush me off. No, we hadn't met before. And I said, 'Yeah, we've met before.' And he said, "No, I I don't think so." And I said, "We met on a plane." And I just told him the same story I just told you. And he put his hands on his face and he said, "The love of God. I want to tell you if your loved ones are look like they're so gone and so destroyed and so messed up in life and divorced and all kind of situations of life, there's a God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's a God that totally cares and understands. Just before di being diagnosed with cancer, it was in December. Brother Tim and Brother Timothy and I was at brother Danny's Demons and we're staying in a in a in a house and in the house we were there and I had my own bedroom and and and I was staying there and I had a vision and I saw in this vision that I was going through a a horrible horrible time and and I began to drop in this pit and I can't describe the pit but it was like a coal mining pit was no light, no light in there and it was just total darkness and and I I saw I saw two men their lives destroyed and and they would die and and I I just kept crawling down in this pit and this road and kept going and I I just can't describe how bad it was. At the bottom of the pit, there was a girl standing &gt;&gt; and she was standing in a beam of light. That girl had I'm not going to go into it, but that girl had stepped away from God and her life looked like it was spiraling into utter darkness. And when I got to the bottom of that pit, I said, "Sissy, are you ready to go home?" She put her arm in my arm and she said, "Uncle Ron, I'm ready to go home." We led her out of there. Went home and I told her parents she's going to come home. I told others, I said, ' Don't don't throw a rock at her. &gt;&gt; Don't you dare throw a rock at her. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't say nothing bad about her. She's a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; She's just lost her way. &gt;&gt; Listen, it kept looking more impossible and more impossible and more impossible. Let me show you the the impossibility today. would you and brother Tom stand up today? &gt;&gt; From a horrible pit. Her dream was to come to this meeting. to come to this meeting and sit with you guys in this church cuz God has turned her life around completely. I wrote this note a week ago. The author of your book has the pen in his hand. &gt;&gt; You just let him write it as you live. &gt;&gt; He's got big plans in your life. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a great big hand. Only God can make this stuff up. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "If God made a promise and God gave a promise and you believe it, I don't care what takes place, it's yours. &gt;&gt; Fight the devil on every ounce of ground that he stands on. Walk over and take it. Take the sword of the word. God's promises are true and nothing can stop them. &gt;&gt; God's promises are true and nothing can stop them. They're God's promises. He gives the pro gives us the promise of just what he said like he did the children of Israel. The Pentecostal church has come to their tus darbia and are we able? Can we do it? Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Can we walk up there and take a hold of God's promises and say, "It's the truth, and I claim it. I own it. It's mine. God gave me the promise." Another place he said, "God will never give you a promise until first, unless first there is a deposit for it." A good man wouldn't give you a check with no money in the bank. An honest man wouldn't. Well, God wouldn't give you his check for salvation or healing unless there's a deposit for it. God has prepared it. I love that word. God has prepared it. &gt;&gt; Cancer would have never struck my life until God has prepared a healing for it. &gt;&gt; He told Abraham that he was going to have a child and that settled it. He's told you that you're going to get the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So now, no matter what's taking place in the earth, our government's falling apart, Russia's full of nonsense, &gt;&gt; all of the things that are taking place around us, Sodom and Gomorrah is everywhere that you see it, God made a promise. &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ. It's not even up for option. &gt;&gt; It's not somebody's idea or some concoction of William Brandham. God made the promise. &gt;&gt; I don't know if the message works. Look around. &gt;&gt; I want you to know. Look around. &gt;&gt; Look around. The message works. If we could just understand the power of the word of God and allow it to be released maybe even for you this this night. God arranged a service like this. God's arranged these three thoughts for so far for the meeting. So it means that God's got plans. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Let's just think about examples that one might might help us here. We've come, we've spent money to come in these meetings. God's made arrangements of who would speak and and when they would speak, even who sings, the musicians that are here. I wish I could play a play a horn like that guy. Maybe I'm a little vain, but I Hey, listen. I quit preaching if I can blow a horn like that. But since we're here, we don't want to miss out on our opportunity. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would stop and say, "Don't miss it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. You sitting there, then go over to a couple people and then come back to him say, "Now, don't miss it." &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to I'm just going to say this to you. You've come to the meeting. &gt;&gt; God knew where you were going to sit. He knew what color outfit that you would have on. I want you to understand, don't miss the opportunity that you're sitting in even right now. &gt;&gt; A moment can be short or can be long. God God's not so worried about time. Well, give me an example, brother. Joshua said, "Son, stand still." &gt;&gt; Moses said, "Let my people go." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask what you will and it shall be done unto you." &gt;&gt; He said, "I and my father are one. When you've seen me, you've seen the father. &gt;&gt; Whom do men say that I, the son of man, am? &gt;&gt; One man spoke up. Peter spoke up and said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood has not revealed that unto you, but my father which is in heaven. There's a man named Finey. Finey was a lawyer. He was a lawyer. This might be good for our young people sitting here. Finey was a lawyer. God be to deal with his heart, but he knew he needed the Holy Ghost in his life. He needed the living presence of God. And one day he was outside of the office and he was down behind some bushes and he was praying out to God, "God, fill me with the Holy Ghost. I need you to live in my life. I need to be powerful." And two women walked past. And he was ashamed that he was caught in that condition. So he jumped up and he realized he was ashamed in front of people. &gt;&gt; And then when he went back down on his knees, he asked God to forgive him of his being embarrassed. Forgive him of what other people would think. &gt;&gt; We need to be so changed it doesn't matter what other people think. It doesn't matter if we embarrass oursel. &gt;&gt; If we got to go to a hole pin, let's go. I got to have Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just got to pray through until he comes down. How long, brother Ron? Listen, let me just say this to you. Some comes quick, some takes a long time. Let me just say, keep praying. Not just today, tomorrow, months maybe, that he will come. &gt;&gt; John Wesley was quite a man, brother Joe, for you. 5 foot one for me, redheaded, once will be again. And his speaking was so powerful. He was so powerful. He was a man that really didn't believe in a lot of emotion, but his speaking was so powerful until people would get drunk while they were hearing him speak. Fall out. 10,000 people was slain in the spirit in a field. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he was, you know, he thought he had so much to say until he wanted him. He went out and tried to get them to set up. This is important. You need to hear it. But they were so inspired under the Holy Ghost, they were slain in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a moment that that must have been like. Yes. &gt;&gt; Patrick Henry came by a preacher in our area. And this preacher was against the the Orthodox church. And they were putting him out and they had now put him in jail. And he was standing in stocks to where he would die hours later. And this man was screaming his last sermon, "Give me liberty or give me death. And Patrick Henry was on a horse and he was riding to where his voters or his constituents were &gt;&gt; and he heard that man preach his last sermon and in that moment it changed Patrick Henry's life. Of course we know the rest of the story but had it not been for that preacher. &gt;&gt; But that shouldn't be a couple of hundred years ago. Let me just say you need to be inspired in the moment. Give me life. Give me life. God, I'm sitting in this service. I need the life and the inspiration of Almighty God in my life. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about what happened decades ago. I'm talking about what happened right now. &gt;&gt; This meeting is more than about seeing one another or hearing great preaching. We need a rekindling of the fire in our lives. &gt;&gt; We want a living God. A living God. A living God. A living God. &gt;&gt; Can you say it with me? I want a living God in my life. Our nation was shattered. War had taken place. Gettysburg had happened and they were going to have a ceremony, a memorial. They were going to have a couple different speakers to stand. Somebody had to have God in their life for the moment. I'm talking about for the moment. Charles Spurgeon had sent a letter from Europe to Abraham Lincoln and he said the only way to settle a war is God. With those things in his mind, he went to the Gettysburg and he sat there for two hours as a man named Edward Edbert spoke. For two hours, if I hadn't have told you his name, you wouldn't know it right now. &gt;&gt; Everybody forgot who it was &gt;&gt; that spoke. Two hours But the next speaker was a tall, slender man that now had the weight of a nation that was split apart. And he stood up and he spoke two minutes. Two minutes. And those two minutes changed this nation. I've done spoke way more than two minutes, but I pray that this service change your life. &gt;&gt; Winston Churchill was standing when our nation was at war. Europe looked like it was going to be trounced. And he stood up and they had said it was the greatest ortor in the entire world. And after making all kind of applause about how great this orator was, he stood to the feet and before all the cadetses and soldiers, he screamed these words, "Never give up." He took a minute and he screamed it again, "Never give up." And then one more time he screamed it in the audience. Never give up. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, we've heard you tell that story before. Well, let me just say it again to you. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again to you. There's a lot of powers that want you to give up. There's powers of darkness trying to press you from your position &gt;&gt; because you've got more authority than every devil in hell &gt;&gt; and he would like to press you out of your position. But I want to say this to you, regardless of your storm or regardless of your trial, never. I've sat in many doctor's offices and they would look at me and say, "Have you come to the point to where you're ready to give up?" And I can see the blood ball in Sister Conniey's face. And I say these words that Winston Churchill said, "I'll never give up. Now, let me just say many people can quote these great words when there's no storm. &gt;&gt; And a lot of people say, "Well, you know, I would do this or I would do that." &gt;&gt; There's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacks in life. &gt;&gt; They're not in the storm, &gt;&gt; but they got an opinion. I'm always interested people that have an opinion's never done anything. &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. A lot of people that have an opinion about your life. &gt;&gt; There are a lot that they want to tell you about this and that and this and that and well, brother Ron, I don't know what you're talking about. There's a lot of couples that say, "I'll never let my child act like that." &gt;&gt; When they don't have any children, But their children have become brats. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's a lot of grandmas and granddads sitting here. That's right. If I ever heard thus sayeth the Lord. That's right. Right there. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham told us nobody can take your place. That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody can take your place. You're a special individual. Your fingerprints are special. Your eyes are special. Your hair, your build is special. The reason is God pre-planned you. &gt;&gt; He had this one to marry this one and this one to marry this one and this one to marry since Adam. &gt;&gt; And then you say, "God hasn't done nothing for He did a whole lot for you before you ever got here. We wouldn't have known this without a prophet, but when you were born, you were one out of a million. &gt;&gt; Now, you take that one out of a million through all those generations all the way back to Adam. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you can even calculate that, but I want you to understand, look at all of that calculation, and he still got you here. &gt;&gt; And if he can get you here, he can get you there. Now maybe you've come to this service tonight like that little woman came. She had been at a spot where 12 years 12 years that she had been she had been uh battling with this condition. She had went to all kind of doctors. She'd went to all kind of situations in life. She had done a lot of different things and she had give it all. &gt;&gt; She was now expended all of her insurance. She expended all of her all of her help and all of her neighbors help. And let me just say the condition that she was in. She couldn't go to church. She couldn't hug her neighbors. She couldn't be with her family. &gt;&gt; They all believed that she was cursed. She couldn't go to worship &gt;&gt; and she constantly had this on her mind. She You talking about battle of the mind. &gt;&gt; Will I ever be whole again? Will I ever live a normal life? Am I preaching to somebody? &gt;&gt; When you've expended all &gt;&gt; and your storm won't give up. She didn't want to contaminate nobody else. Given all of her money, nobody wants to be around her. They all said she'd cursed. Rumors. Rumors were all around her. You got to imagine the rumors that was there. But she believed if I can get to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It doesn't matter about your neighbors at this service. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter who's sitting here. &gt;&gt; It's you. &gt;&gt; It's you. &gt;&gt; That's the situation you've got to be in. I'm not here for somebody else. &gt;&gt; It's you. &gt;&gt; Don't blame nobody else for the service. Don't blame Brother Tim. Don't bring the deacons. Don't blame who you're sitting around. You've come to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Then don't let nobody get in your way. &gt;&gt; She heard that Jesus was coming by. No doubt she'd heard miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle. Today she decided, "Today's my moment. &gt;&gt; If I'm ever going to have an opportunity, I cannot miss this. &gt;&gt; I cannot miss it." Let me just say when opportunity comes, you've got to take advantage of it. &gt;&gt; We won't be here Tuesday night. So, you got to get ready. &gt;&gt; Tonight's your moment. &gt;&gt; Don't let this meeting go by and you miss. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No doubt as she begins to come toward the crowd, people tried to discourage her from going. She wasn't there for them. &gt;&gt; That's right. Maybe she was like the lady in Mexico carrying a dead body. Listen, you can have 300 deacons and you're not going to stop me. &gt;&gt; My baby's been dead all day, all night. But I if I can get him to the prophet of God, &gt;&gt; I saw all those miracles. If I can get my baby to the prophet of God, don't try to stop me. Don't get in my way. I'm not leaving this service with a dead baby. She took her opportunity. She pressed her way. She didn't need a private interview. She didn't need her name called. She didn't need him to turn and lay her his hands on her. All her desire was was to touch the hymn of his garment. Brother Ron, you ever heard of anything like that? We were preaching a meeting in North Carolina as a man came to our table said, "What are you guys here for?" I said, "Well, we were here to for a convention and what do you do?" And we preached the message of William Brandham. He said, "I was in his meeting." Older man said, "I was in his meeting. and I was eat up with cancer. And he said, I didn't get a prayer card and I couldn't get in line. He said, I said, I thought I'd stand beside of a pole, the closest pole to where Brother Brandham was at. And he said, I knew that I wasn't going to get get to be prayed for, but I wanted to get close and get in his atmosphere. And he said, "Brother Brandham, step to that side of the platform and he spinned." And he said, "When he spend, his coattail came out." And he said, "I just reached and touched his coattail." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I felt it leaving." &gt;&gt; For the critics that don't believe the message, ought to talk to that guy. And this woman was now and she felt it dry up immediately. She knew. She knew. Now Jesus stops the entire crowd and he says, "Who touched me?" And the disciples quickly say, "Who touched you?" Everybody's trying to touch you, but this touch, &gt;&gt; this touch took strength away from me, took virtue away from me. &gt;&gt; I got to find out who touched me. And then she came forward and she told him her condition, &gt;&gt; her situation. Now listen, he's not found any kind of faith like this. But I want you to just notice his words. He said, "Thy faith, thy faith, thy faith hath made thee whole." Understand now, it's your faith that operates. It's your faith that's a situation. &gt;&gt; It's your faith, as brother Tim says, has to be put into action. &gt;&gt; You must think about a miracle, your miracle that that you're seeking for. Maybe there's just a few people that are sitting here tonight that that need such a miracle, but they know what it is to be broken. They know what it is for their life to be destroyed. They didn't ask for this trial in their life. They didn't ask for things to go upside down. But I want to talk to you. When a mess takes place in your life, it's only the building blocks of material to make you well. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Need an example. Joseph had a vision and then the trials and the tests and the jealousy that he would have to endure being sold by his brethren, &gt;&gt; being sold into slavery, then be lied on and throw into a pit. There's no way that you could have asked Joseph, Joseph, is this drawing you closer to the vision. &gt;&gt; Is this Can you explain how this is drawing you closer to the vision? But all of these steps had to go on &gt;&gt; to put him in in position &gt;&gt; to put him in position to get him ready &gt;&gt; to sit on the throne. &gt;&gt; Betrayed by his brothers was stepping him to a vision. Being sold into slavery was stepping him toward the vision. &gt;&gt; To be lied on was another step into the vision. to being in a pit in a prison. What's getting him closer &gt;&gt; to the vision? five years ago when the Lord spoke to me and he said these words, "If you will trust me, I will use you like never before." I never would have thought my world was about to be spinned into stage four cancer. I was looking for a greater anointing to preach. Maybe a channel of healing, maybe for God to do a special place another gift in my life. I was not expecting a trial. I was not expecting a storm. If I could evaluate the storm, this is a hurricane. &gt;&gt; I'm reminded that God's walking in storms. The disciples were in a ship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and they looked like they were going to die, these men knew how to handle a boat. &gt;&gt; But in a storm where it looks like that they were about to perish, &gt;&gt; they saw look like a ghost coming to them &gt;&gt; because Jesus walks in storms. &gt;&gt; So in the middle of your storm, if you will take notice when it looks like you're about to be destroyed, When it looks like your world is about to be crushed, &gt;&gt; if you'll just look closely, Jesus is walking in your storm. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a big hand. Is this mine? It is now. The very thing that looks like it will destroy you may be the very thing that God's glory is using. And God knows that you'll come through. &gt;&gt; You don't know it. &gt;&gt; Can I make it through this? Well, God knows. &gt;&gt; So why don't we just trust him? &gt;&gt; Trust doctors. Listen, they're practicing physicians. &gt;&gt; They're practicing physicians. I've taken as much as $36,000 worth of chemo in months. In one month, I'm now on $18,000 worth of chemo every month. Thank God I don't have to pay for it. &gt;&gt; So, God is a provider. What was meant for evil? &gt;&gt; What was meant for evil? &gt;&gt; When somebody lies on you, don't worry. &gt;&gt; God will make a way for you. &gt;&gt; When somebody tries to destroy you, don't get upset. God will make a way through it. &gt;&gt; Can I just say it again? The pit didn't stop the promise. Being sold as a slave didn't stop it. Having a blood issue for 12 years didn't stop it. &gt;&gt; Being married to five husbands and living with another did not stop the predestinated seed of God. &gt;&gt; You know, probably none of us would have thought Paul was a messenger. Because Paul was trying to get some of us throwed in prison. Then he would hold the coat for Stephen and he had destroyed some of our families. He was after us to destroy the message while he was the creator of Believe the Sign. Can you imagine? He's now on a road to Damascus to destroy some some more of us. But today, there's going to be a moment. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're a critic sitting here today and you're you're believing all the nonsense that the that the world has got going on and you're believing this situation. Let me just say, don't get your information from CNN and &gt;&gt; Fox and all of this nonsense of America. You get your eyes on Jesus. &gt;&gt; You get your eyes on Jesus. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I'm going to behave. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I get so tore up about Tennessee being champions, sir. I get so tore up about this one, and I get so tore up about that one. I get so tore up about blue hair. I get so tore up about this gay business and all of that kind of situation. The world world's heating up. Well, let me just say this to you. The world is heating up. It's going to heat up. &gt;&gt; But if you don't believe the message, it's going to heat up for you. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I don't believe bombs are going to drop. We'll stay here. &gt;&gt; You don't need a prophet. Then you go, "No, &gt;&gt; I may be just talking to one or two, but I I'm here &gt;&gt; now." You see the people that had listened to Noah preach for 120 years. &gt;&gt; That had give him all kind of criticism and all kind of nonsense. Come here just a minute, Bubb. You don't have to fix it. I'm just gonna let it go. Here it go. It's worse than a barking dog. Is there something wrong, brother? Well, we don't pay attention to that kind of thing. No way. So you've heard him for 120 years and you said science tells us there's no rain up there, &gt;&gt; no water up there. &gt;&gt; And it's told us that, you know, he's just a he's not even an architect. &gt;&gt; And and that kind of wood won't build a good ark. &gt;&gt; He's building it three stories. The windows at the top, one door. Where is the fire escape plan? &gt;&gt; And he keeps preaching the same message. &gt;&gt; He keeps preaching the same message. Maybe a lot of people would come and just borderline believers and listen to it, make fun of it, talk about him and his family. Oh, it's just a family thing. But I think it's interesting. I don't know what those people were thinking when all of a sudden two by two &gt;&gt; animals came from all over the world without drones. You talking about a big God that me and you serve &gt;&gt; without a system of technology. &gt;&gt; Just a movement hit them &gt;&gt; and a gathering begin to happen from all over the world to the ark. &gt;&gt; How's the rapture going to happen? Don't you try to figure it out. It's going to be orchestrated by God. Well, brother, I don't know about that. If God could get a warthog on a on a boat, &gt;&gt; if he could get a wthog on a or a turtle. Are you with me? I'm just going to keep on. &gt;&gt; If he could do that, A creature that doesn't have a soul, how much more can he take care of predestinated seed of God? &gt;&gt; It is not you and I that's going to produce a rapture. It's going to be in us. &gt;&gt; But it's God &gt;&gt; has gathered us together from all over the world. Oh, he's going to make us a zoo. Going to make us a zoo. Ain't that interesting? He's making us a zoo. Now the door closes. Noah didn't close the door. God closed the door. And it doesn't happen the first day. Brother Bham said they would have to sweat it out. &gt;&gt; Didn't happen today. It didn't happen tomorrow. It's going to happen. &gt;&gt; When's going to happen, Brother Ron? When's the rapture? When's the resurrection going to happen? When's all these things going to happen? Just wait. &gt;&gt; Just keep walking. &gt;&gt; Can I talk to you now, Brother Ron? I'm so miserable in this world. Why? Why? The token ought to be applied to your home. &gt;&gt; The joy of God ought to be in your life. &gt;&gt; When you come to church, it's not a miserable time. You're ready for the house of God. Preach to me. This is what I live on. Come on, church. Preach to me a half an hour. Preach me three hours. It don't matter. I'm ready for the word of God. I'm thirsty. I'm hungry. That's what feeds my soul, &gt;&gt; Brother Ron. We've heard it all. You better listen again. &gt;&gt; You better listen it again. Are you with me? That's why God has us to repeat sermons. &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't get it the first time. That's why you've got to listen to things that are to be over and over again. Spoken word is original seed. You got to listen to it over and over again &gt;&gt; cuz you're walking in different stages of your life and maturing as you going along. You're going to catch more and more and more. &gt;&gt; That's why Wednesday night service is so important. That's why Sunday morning service is so important. &gt;&gt; That's why it's important for you to have the right attitude. &gt;&gt; I've only got one service. Now, the scripture says, and this is my favorite scripture. And we know that all things &gt;&gt; work together for the good to them that love God. &gt;&gt; When it's talking about all things, it doesn't specifically stop, Brother Tim. It doesn't stop and say, "Except for that storm, &gt;&gt; except for that season in your life." It says that when we know all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; For whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of God of his son that he might be the firstborn of many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them he also called it. And whom he called them he also justified it. Whom he justified them he also glorified. And what shall we then say to these things? If God be before us, &gt;&gt; I want to say there, let's read this together. What shall we then say to these things? If God be before us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? [Applause] This is in my notes, so I'll go ahead and say it. It's not your reputation that's on the line. &gt;&gt; It's not your reputation that's on the mine. &gt;&gt; Let me give you an example. It's God's reputation. &gt;&gt; 42inch caribou. That's right. &gt;&gt; Silver tip grizzly bear. &gt;&gt; Three squirrels, &gt;&gt; seven seals, &gt;&gt; all of them opened, &gt;&gt; seven thunders. Are you with me now? An open book in your hand. &gt;&gt; God did all of that. &gt;&gt; I don't see a bear nowhere. It's God's reputation on the line. &gt;&gt; How long are those horns? There'll be a 42 in green checkered shirt. &gt;&gt; I've never been in a vision, brother Ron. Let me just say all of us are in a vision. &gt;&gt; We all are in a vision. &gt;&gt; And it's not somebody else's vision. It's God's vision. I want to ask you, do you have any idea how big God is, Brother Ron? I'm in a trial. Ain't nothing's going to fix it. Really? Really? The God that said, "Let there be," and believed his own word, and the sun came into existence. The God that created the heavens and all the stars and aligned them up and they orbit a certain way and it's all in a perfect order. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The God that created your hand. &gt;&gt; The God that created your eyes. The God that knew where you would be born. So he put your potassium and the pot ash so your natural body can be taken out of the earth. &gt;&gt; The God that knew how tall you'd be, &gt;&gt; how fluffy you would be, how athletic you would be. He knew even your characteristics. &gt;&gt; Why don't you quit wrestling with yourself a little bit? We're looking in the mirror and say, "I'm a nobody." You're God's somebody. &gt;&gt; So when you pray, how do I pray, Brother Ron? It's like talking to the best friend that you got. &gt;&gt; It's not mental transfusion to where that you you send your thoughts to God. You got to pray. Pray is when you lift your voice before God and he knows your voice and you lift your your decree before God and your need before God. A God that hears every prayer. But I'll tell you our problem. And here's why I'm here. So many times we look for things to be answered and we haven't prayed them yet. &gt;&gt; Now God's the prophets told us that God's crowning achievement is you. &gt;&gt; So he pre-planned you. He orchestrated your life. But he also just didn't leave you here to go through storms unarmed. The prophet will tell us about the military and they'll arm them a certain way. They're going into battle. So, they're going to need the best weaponry that they can get. Now, God doesn't evolve and give better weapons as we go along. Every hundred years, God changes the weaponry. &gt;&gt; He gave us his word. &gt;&gt; And when your word, the word of God goes across your lips, &gt;&gt; moms and dads claim your children. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Put them in the hands of Jesus. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; We can believe these signs shall follow them that believe and say that's just for the ministry, but it's for you. &gt;&gt; How powerful prayer is. Prayer changes things. Prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings. There is no atomic bomb. Hydrogen bomb is powerful as prayer. Prayer will change even the mind of God. That's powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother man says, "And the church has the authority from Jesus Christ. In my name shall they cast out devils and speak with new tongues. And if they take up serpents or drink any deadly things, it will not hurt them." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They'll lay hands on the sickened, they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Let me just drop this note here. The word of God is superior to your feelings. Where'd you get that right there? &gt;&gt; He said it and I believe it. &gt;&gt; It's not based on your feelings. &gt;&gt; I didn't feel nothing. Don't mean anything. &gt;&gt; The scripture says in Philippians chapter won't be much longer. I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me. Yes, &gt;&gt; he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might. He increasth strength. Paul said this, "Therefore, I take I take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities in pers in persecutions and distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, &gt;&gt; then I am strong." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's not based on your feelings. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But of power and of love and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Psalms 18:12, "I will love thee, oh Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my strength, in whom I will trust, my buckler and the and the horn of my salvation and my high tower." &gt;&gt; First John chapter 4 and verse four. Ye are of God. Ye are of God. That's your origin. That's where you came from. We came from God. We're going back to God. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he. &gt;&gt; You got to need greater is he. &gt;&gt; He's greater than your financial trouble. He's greater than your children going out in the world. He knows how far they'll go. Andrew's got a dog. That dog is a wiry dog. He's a dirty looking dog. I've got cats. That dog hates my cats. I got a dog and that dog's named Dorothy. Dorothy's a house dog. Dorothy knows where she lives. That dog don't know where he lives. That dog. Now, what happened? Andrew had a had a a collar on that dog that would buzz every time he got close to the to where his boundary was. And that dog had too much energy to be placed in a little bitty pin, &gt;&gt; probably acre pin. And so he would get bored and he would eat lights, rubber off of bicycles. He would tear flowers out of the ground. He would make a mess. He'd go off to preach somewhere and I would give him report, detailed report. He ate the gutter off of your house. I did not like that dog. You know what? What happened one day? He took the collar off. Now that dog now thinks I'm his owner. I get on my farm buggy. That dog's sitting in my lap. We go to get mail, he's sitting right in my lap. I go to haul things over to Whitney's house, that dog's right there. The collar's off. &gt;&gt; Now, when the collar was off, I found out how much I like that dog. When Brother Tim stayed a week with me, he and I walked every day. That dog walked right with us step for step. Of course, it went a lot of different places that brother Tim and I didn't go, but he was right there with us. &gt;&gt; That dog don't think he owns it no more, but I make sure, Sister Connie, don't we? We make sure that dog gets fed. Now, I don't mean to cont to to to equate you to a dog, but some of you have got a collar on you &gt;&gt; and you're bored and you're chewing &gt;&gt; the gutter off your house. &gt;&gt; And God knows if you can ever break through. Come on, church. If you can ever break through, &gt;&gt; if you can ever have a breakthrough in your life, &gt;&gt; and you're not sitting there bound by what somebody else thinks &gt;&gt; and after a while, start praising God for yourself. &gt;&gt; Stop worshiping God for yourself. &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad your storm is. The way to to get out of your storm is praise. Praise. Worship. &gt;&gt; Can I go? Can I have just a couple more minutes? &gt;&gt; It must baffle the devil. It must blame. It must blow his mind. How do the worst girl in the community can walk in this church and in a service? Walk from a harlot &gt;&gt; to a princess. &gt;&gt; From a drunk &gt;&gt; to a prince. That's right. &gt;&gt; From a dope addict to an addict of God. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I just got to have a fix." We need more than a fix. We need a transformation with God. This might be for somebody. The night I got saved, the night I walked to an altar, let me put it like that. I had a 12-pack in my car cuz I was planning to go to a party, but I went to a pre-party. &gt;&gt; I listened to a guy that I thought preached too long because it was getting into my business. Now, I had been raised in the message and I knew the quotes and I could tell the stories. But tonight, I realized this service was for me. I found myself at the altar. I found myself at the altar. And let me just say, if you get in his presence, it don't take five hours. I got up from that altar. I walked out to my car. I drove. The church was a near a filling station, the gas station. I went across the street and there was a trash can sitting there and I took that 12-pack and I put it right in that trash can to today. &gt;&gt; I've never had another desire for one of them. I've watched prostitutes come to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Drug addicts come to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Murderers come to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen, God knows the depths of the pit. &gt;&gt; He knows the depths of the pit. He knows where you're at. &gt;&gt; God knows how to find you. Brother Ron, I don't know how I can change. It's not up to you. &gt;&gt; All God needs is a willing vessel to say, "I surrender." &gt;&gt; Give me a biblical answer. Paul, &gt;&gt; Peter, &gt;&gt; the woman at the well, &gt;&gt; God knows how to come and get us. He knows how to set us on fire to turn our world upside down. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I don't know if I can understand the word. Let me just say this. You just keep getting washed by it. &gt;&gt; You just keep coming to church. Are you with me, brother? I don't understand it. Keep getting to just keep coming and listening. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the word of God will open itself up to you. Brother Ron, I'm in a storm. They say it's an F5 and they say I'm not going to make it. My house is going to be washed away. My house is going to be blew away. I may go to prison. I may do all these things in my life. I don't care how bad a storm is, there's always a rainbow. &gt;&gt; Brother Isaiah, I told your daddy, don't give up on him. The odds looked almost impossible. I was with brother Tim the other day and we was sitting on a great big deck and this is what happened. Your father said, "Brother Ron, I've been trying for five years to try to ask you a question." And he said, "Every time I get close to you, I ask you a question." He said, "I just can't get my question asked. We're on the top of the parkway. We're overlooking the Shannondoa Valley. We're standing there and he said, "Brother Ron, this is a good place. This is a good place for me to ask you a question." I said, "Okay." I said, "Brother G, let's sit down just for a moment." We sat on some tall chairs. I won't forget it because I had to jump up on it. And he had just been talking about you. It was his dream to see you in church. It's his dream to see you doing good. It was his dream. He had a token with God. Are you with me? I'm sorry to point you out, but this is a good deal. He said, "Can I ask you the question now?" I said, "No, I'm going to tell you your question." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And I told him the question he'd been wanting to give me for five years. And I said, "Brother Gito, God forgave you of that a long time ago." And the friend that you was with, so you know that I know cuz God showed it to me. Your friend was named Eddie. And he just throwed his hands back. Sister Connie, you remember that. He screamed and all those tourists on that on that balcony looked over said, "What is going on?" Listen, that Belgium man could scream. And I told him, I said, "Brother Ger, don't you worry about Isaiah. You put a token over his life. &gt;&gt; And I don't care how far he's gone. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I don't care about the situation that's going on. God's made us a promise. Your storm may seem bad, but God made the promise. &gt;&gt; Not a man made the promise. &gt;&gt; Not some fickle man that'll change his mind, but God made the promise. &gt;&gt; What about your life? I pointed out three different people here tonight out of the mouth of two or three witnesses. &gt;&gt; These stories are real. &gt;&gt; No need me telling your story. These stories are real to me. Brother Ron, you shouldn't tell those stories. Well, your pastor preached on Sunday that we've got to keep these stories alive. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, what he preached about, I'm standing here to tell you &gt;&gt; our God's alive. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you're wanting the Holy Ghost, he's here for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He made the promise for you. &gt;&gt; If you haven't given your heart to God, he's here for you. &gt;&gt; If you got children that need to come in, he's here for you. But you have to have faith to believe. &gt;&gt; Sister Melissa, remember at 17 hours that couple five years ago that I said I preached a sermon named I must get to Jesus because I was getting weaker every day. I knew that if I continued to get weaker, I wasn't going to have the strength to be able to fight cancer. And I preached I preached my sermon on I must get to Jesus. I'm like Jarius. I need more than church. &gt;&gt; I got to get to Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When I walked out of that pull pit, I came to my own bed and Sister Connie, I said, "Where is 17 hours?" Well, we've drove it enough times to know this place is 17 hours. &gt;&gt; And during the night, God dealt with me. You got to get We're buddies, but you represent more than a preacher. Listen, if you want to die, don't get to him. Don't ask him to come pray for you &gt;&gt; cuz he's not going to commit you to the ground &gt;&gt; cuz he believes in a God that to heal you. [Applause] They arranged it. Sister Karen was in the hospital with a brain bleed. Didn't know if she was going to live or die. And he made time Did I see lightning? Did I feel thunder? No. But in that prayer service, there's two representatives here. In that prayer service, three boys got the Holy Ghost. Luke and Andrew, where you at? Luke and Andrew. There you go. Stand up. Luke and Andrew and a man named Adam, a boy your age, got the Holy Ghost. He's now a deacon in our church. &gt;&gt; When God does business, he does it really well. &gt;&gt; He does it really well. I was so sick going home, they had to stop over and over and over again for me to get home. But when I got home and the boys were going to go to work tomorrow morning, I said, "Wait on me. I'm going to go with you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Since that day, I've not missed a day of work. [Applause] Why, brother Ron? I got to Jesus. &gt;&gt; I got to Jesus more than a man. &gt;&gt; Guys like him and brother Donnie, they're my buddies. But more than a man lives in there. &gt;&gt; More than a man liv. Go ahead and just point at your chest right now. More than a man lives in here. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the storms of your life are telling to you tonight. &gt;&gt; Greater is he &gt;&gt; that is in you &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. I could spend the next weeks telling you the miracles that I have seen. &gt;&gt; Weeks telling you the miracles I've seen. Brother on that's just people you know. Okay. Sister Melissa that stood just a few moments ago. They called me about her cousin that was dying. They said she would die in a couple hours. She was now weighing 85 pounds and she was totally green. Drugs had ate her body up. When I got to the hospital, her husband talked to me about funeral plans and I said, "Listen, I have not driven an hour to talk to you about funeral plans. I'm going to pray for her." &gt;&gt; Her eyes were rolled back in the back of her head and I called her by name. And that was the first time that she had actually looked out of her eyes in days. and her eyes rolled up and I told her what I was there for. I was going to pray for her. And I told her, I said, "There's been times that you hated me, but I have came here to pray for you and God's going to raise you up." &gt;&gt; Listen, doctors were there. They were sitting there and they when I got done praying for her, I said, "She'll walk down the hallway with you tomorrow." The doctors, the nurses stopped me and said, "Brother Ron, you don't know what you're talking." Said, "She's she's dying in the next couple of hours." I said, "No, no, no. I didn't say it." He did. &gt;&gt; She walked down the hallway with her husband the next day. I want to ask you one more thing. How big is your God? &gt;&gt; How big is your God? &gt;&gt; You're sitting here needing deliverance tonight. I want to ask you, when are you going to ask for it? &gt;&gt; The storm's in your life, when are you going to call for the peacekeeper? &gt;&gt; You got marriage problems, he can help you. financial troubles, he can help you. Your children are away from God, he can help you. &gt;&gt; Cancer in your body, he can help you. You're laying in a hospital right now in a hospital bed and the doctors tell you're going to die. I want you to listen. You say, "Brother Ron, I've never seen a miracle. Let's stand to our feet just now. Brother Brandon would tell us when wood lays hands on another a believer to a believer said there's a light that's transmitted from one hand to another. I'm going to ask you to do something. I want you to believe. I want you to believe. I want you to believe. It's not about what your neighbor thinks. I want you to believe. Young men, young ladies, you're wanting the Holy Ghost in your life. I want you to believe. You got a storm going on. It looks so horrible. I want you to have a vision that Jesus is there to speak peace to your storm. Can he? I'm living proof. [Music] I'm living proof that he can. I don't know if this message works. Look around. Look around. You got questions about the message, just open your eyes just for a moment and look around. This message works. This message works. There's a lot of impossibilities that have stood in this building, but they've been at peace for decades now when God changed their life. Brother Isaiah, I believe you could say it. This message works. You gave your heart for brother Timothy preaching to you. Something became real. It was a moment in your life and you've never been the same. never been the same. Now, here's what I believe. You can walk out of this service and never be the same. &gt;&gt; Will you believe me? Will you believe me? Will you believe me? Now, I want you to believe. Now, here's what I'm going to ask you to do. I want you to pray across your lips to where even you can hear your prayer. And I want you to call out the storm in your life and say, "I'm done with this storm. God, I ask you to help me just now. Ask you to help me. Ask you to help me. Lay your hands on one another now. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Marcus, I want you to pray for your son's father-in-law. He's got cancer. I want you to call his name now. Hallelujah. Sister Melissa, you got a son. It was worth driving 17 hours for. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, a name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow. I call on Jesus. Father, the one that said, "Let there be." and believed his own word. The Lord, you see the storms of lives across this building now. All of us has suffered storms in our lives, situations that look so impossible. Now, Father, we believe. You've asked us to believe. I've got needs in my life, even standing here as a minister. I ask you where doctors can't help. I need you. &gt;&gt; Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we lift your name. &gt;&gt; You see our needs. You're a living God. We don't need our name called. We don't need us to tell us where we live. You've already in this this message orchestrated this entire service. Now, we ask for action. We ask you for the word to live now in our lives. We present our needs before you. May change break. May prison doors. May the slavery of our lives be over with. Lord God, set us free. young men, young ladies that need you. Father, I ask you as they invite you into their lives. May they never walk out of this building the same after tonight. Lord, fill our lives with the Holy Ghost and fire. Touch our lives tonight, Lord. Sweep down across this building like an angel's wings sweep across this building tonight. Touch our lives &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, that you've heard our prayers. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; You know I need in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, I thank you. Lord, I thank you.

We lay it in the hands of Jesus right now. [Music] &gt;&gt; We bring our burdens to you tonight. We'll lay them right here tonight. In Jesus Christ name we pray.

I believe we're going to see people filled with the Holy Spirit. I believe there's going to be revivals in our lives. Father, I thank you, Father.
