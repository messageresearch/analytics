here searching for answers you I feel like that applies to every single one of us we all have a need today and you know maybe our needs are different from those sitting next to us maybe some need healing maybe some need Deliverance some need strength maybe you're just barely holding on you don't know how you're going to take another step but I know the one who can answer every question who can heal every sickness who can deliver every bound is not just watching us this morning from afar but he's here this morning he's here to do the exceeding and the Abundant and he's not just here as another being but he's here in us living in US overcoming through us I have Supreme confidence in him this morning that he's here to back up his word and to and to deliver his children do you believe it this morning let's talk to him Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord From the Bottom of our hearts Lord that in this day Lord you've come and revealed yourself Lord in the fullness Lord You've manifested yourself in the fullness Lord we're not wandering around in darkness but the word is wide open the seals are taken off we see who you are we see who we are Lord Lord you've given us Lord the strength and the authority the power that we have need of to overcome in this day Lord you promis you would never leave us or forsake us and we can testify one and all that that word is true Lord you've been with us in the darkest of days Lord you've shown your light all around us today we just come to give you praise and glory Lord as we look into your word father I pray that you'll open it that you'll reveal it that you'll manifest yourself here this morning Lord Lord that each one Lord would find that portion for themselves today that speaks to their heart may they be able to grab it Lord and be elevated into the Realms of Faith father for their need today Lord just come now and break the bread of life Lord you you see Lord how scrambled some of these thoughts Lord I'm just asking that you'll bring them together Lord I'm asking that you will bring it Lord Lord that you'll calm me now settle me now and anoint me father but not only me but your people Lord that that they will hear what the spirit is speaking father through the word Lord we commit it all to you now we love you in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen God bless you this morning isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord amen and I know we had expected brother at Tim to be ministering this morning but he came down Sick and asked me to to fill in so so here we are so let's just all get into the word together and and and enjoy the word of God together amen we're going to turn to the scriptures this morning into the book of Colossians the first chapter Colossians the first chapter and once again I have a a PowerPoint that I put together just because I do have a lot of of of scriptures and quotes and I just felt like the quotes were necessary to really drive home the points that I was trying to make and hopefully help you to to stay with me and follow it so so we'll be using that this morning and I'll also make it much easier on those in in the in the booth so I don't know if you can read that or not me neither so while they're working on that I'm just going to go ahead and we'll just read we'll read the scripture together Colossians 1 and13 it says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins verse 15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist I want you to look there in verse 15 again at the beginning and it said who is the image of the invisible God we're also going to read one verse in in 1 Timothy 1 and 17 it says now unto the king Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God God be honor and Glory forever and ever amen amen I pray that the Lord will add His blessings to the reading of the word as you take your seats I'd like to speak to you for a for a moment on the Unseen becoming manifest the Unseen becoming manifest another way we might could put this would be the invisible being made visible amen so the word makes it plain here and I believe that we all understand that God is a spirit and and being a spirit he is invisible John 4:24 tells us that that God is a spirit and we just read here in first Timothy that he's invisible so so we worship an invisible God we worship an invisible God today and and if we were to if we were to go back in in in time as it were and look at the beginning of the Bible we would see there in Genesis the first chapter that it starts out as he begins to create the heavens and he begins to create the Earth but if we would go back before that if we would go back before time began one one place brother brandham actually says let's take a trip a hundred million years before there ever was a star a moon or anything we're up and running all right let me get to where we are we already read the scriptures didn't we all right so that's where we're at he says let's go back a 100 million years before there was time or or before there was a star a moon or anything because see there was a time and we use the word time there Loosely because it's Before Time began but just for our understanding there was a time where there was nothing that there there was a time where where nothing existed and it's hard for us to wrap our minds around that because we have always known time to exist we we we Mark time we Mark birthdays we Mark anniversaries we mark Mark years we Mark days we Mark hours we were born we die we've always known time to exist we've always known the world to exist we've always known things to be tangible something that we can touch and so it's hard for us to wrap our minds around the fact that there was nothing there was nothing but what we're talking about is is before there was anything but before any of this and even before God was God you say well God's always been god well not not really because if you go back before creation God being an object of worship there was nothing to worship him so God wasn't God he he was because he he dwelt alone he was by himself he was in this nothingness in in this great big vastness of Eternity and he was invisible but I want you to know that all that God was all that God was ever going to be all of his word which is himself he wanted manifested he wanted it to be manifested and and even in that that I just said all that he was all of his attributes all of his thinking this great eternal spirit wanted it to be manifested so that he would become God it was in him to be a Healer it was in him to be a savior it was in him to be a father it was in him and he wanted this to be manifested so even then when he dwelt alone he wanted you manifested he wanted you on the earth he wanted you to come forth out of him he wanted to be manifested so going back now to that place before there was anything brother brandham says and there that great space where no one can fathom I can amen that right now I I can't I can't understand it but he says where no one can fathom in their mind beyond that that space eternity that's Jehovah God out there he says and we're taught in the beginning that the logos or the Son of God went out of God so we got to get this clear today so the logos was a part of God that went out from God so so it comes out of God and and brother brandham says it was his first body form he said the Loos was his first body form he would describe it as a as a little white light or as a Halo it's incredible you know I was was thinking about this as I studied how how people read and guess and wonder and Ponder and yet we had a prophet says it was like a little white light it was like a Halo who else can say hey let's take a trip a hundred million years before there was anything and you don't say well he's making this up you say yeah I'm going with this guy I'm going with him because I know we're fit we're taking a trip and we got a tour guy that knows what he's talking about but he says it was like a little white light or a Halo and it was the son of God it was the word of God the logos that would become flesh do we all understand that amen so as the logos comes out of God this light would be the first time that you could describe God as visible right it's the first time that you could use that to describe him because we know the spirit of God is invisible but this light this logos this part that was of him was a visible manifest ation of God it was the Unseen becoming manifest the invisible becoming visible it's the word of God the Son of God it's what became flesh and dwelt amongst us and brother brandham says so he first was god Jehovah and out of him let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo and that was the low go that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of God he says sitting way back in eternity that was God and then going out of God or God unfolding himself and we're going to use that term more unfolding himself come to logos which was the son of God or the word of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the logos amen so so I want I want to make a point here that the word of God will always be manifest the word of God will always be manifest the word will always produce the word will not remain unseen the word will not remain unfulfilled in other words it can't be sent out from him and then return back empty it won't be sent out and then return back is nothing if it said that the logos went out of him and there's nothing well there was nothing and his word went forth and there was still nothing but that can't happen the logos went out of him and suddenly it made manifest and there was a visible manifestation when the word is released it will become manifest it will be fulfilled when the logos came forth immediately we have visibility we have manifestation we can we have something that we can see and say that's God we can see it John 1 now as we're still dealing with the logos John 1 and one it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was God now we we take this scripture and we go right down to verse 14 and it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we connect those two it just makes sense the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that doesn't confuse us at all we see who Jesus was we see who that flesh was but some read that in the nominal world trinitarians and they read that part that says was with God and they make it two separate things like Joe was with Aaron so the word was with God and they read that and they see oh well there's two there we see that that there's two but and they make it two different persons that are co-equal and co-eternal but this language doesn't indicate another person being with God it is an indication that God has changed forms okay that's what it's saying the logos has come forth from God and that logos is now visible he is gone from visible to invis excuse me from invisible to visible or simply simply put there's another expression of God it's still one but there's another expression of him he is manifested as I'll bring it up to our terminology the pillar of fire he is manifested Ed himself when Moses met God in the burning bush what what did he see this logos the pillar of fire it was a visible form the invisible the Unseen had become manifest the word didn't come forth out of him and nothing happened oh come on now start thinking about the word that you're holding on for think about the promises that you're holding on for God's word always brings forth God's word always manest to to the human eye the promise may still be invisible it it's just a promise if I say I promise I'm going to do this until I do it it's still invisible it it's just a word it's only a word but the Fulfillment of the promise makes it become visible the Fulfillment of the promise is what makes it become visible brother Bram says here and now I can see him as he moves over here and draws his memory draws into his memory or his mind a picture of what the world should be now there's not a star or nothing and I read this quote and it just it was it was so awesome to me as he he's sitting there talking about drawing a picture and I just thought it's the master architect it's the master architect sitting there drawing up the plans he he's drawing it up in his mind and at this point right here it still says there's not a star or nothing but at this point it's all already done because he's already thought it and his thoughts are perfect and so at this point it's as good is done he's thought it the the Earth has been thought of and guess what you was in the earth why' he even make the Earth he made the Earth to take you out of the earth so at this point as he thinks that it's already done the Earth is done you are there in the earth he made the Earth to take you out of so so you're an attribute that was in his thinking and so is this Earth that's why he redeems the Earth the Earth was part of him Satan don't get this Earth God redeems this Earth you're part of this Earth Jesus Christ's body was part of this Earth so he redeems the Earth the same way he redeems you but in his mind right here at this point the Earth all of creation you Redemption it's all finished it's all over with It's Already Done why why can we sing that because was already done right here before the first star was ever created he say I can hear him say let there be light and an Adam bursted Yonder and the Sun come into existence deity oh yeah she began to whirl millions of years rolled by and after a while a piece flew off of I love this so much you can just visualize a piece flew off of it star and he stood out there and watched it and it went all down and he stopped it over here after it fell a few million years off went another one he let it fall near a certain place and he stopped it what's he doing he's got it in his mind now that someday there'll be an earth there'll be a mankind on the earth he said let there be it didn't matter how long it took it was going to be made manifest the invisible was going to become visible it didn't matter if it took millions and millions or billions and billions of years once he said let it be those thoughts were in his mind they were invisible only thought but once he released that word once he said let there be and even still it was had you been there to hear it it would have still been invisible it would have still been invisible but the Unseen was going to become manifested the invisible was going to become visible the word was going to take on the form of what it was spoke to be let there be light nothing could stop it it was going to be light it might have taken a long time but it was coming stars were coming the Earth was coming man was coming the promises are coming it's already been spoken the healing is on the way Deliverance is coming the Rapture is coming your Victory is coming Joy is coming overcoming power it's coming the visible will be made visible the Unseen will be made manifest the word's been released it's on its way it may take a long time but it's on its way Hallelujah it will manifest what it was spoken to manifest your Victory is coming Hallelujah you know the thing is I know it's written down in the Bible and that's good I know it it's in our hearts in that that's good but I would begin taking that word and putting it on my lips for my situation and I would begin releasing that word out of my mouth the prophet of God told us that when you take the word on the lips of a born again son or daughter of God and they release that word it's the same as deity speaking he said every Mountain's got to move he said Satan can't stand before that man and if that word released from the lips of deity created galaxies created worlds and I can take the same word and put it on these lips it's the same is don't tell me depression won't crumble don't tell me anxiety won't flee don't tell me homes can't be restored don't tell me relationships can't be created galaxies formed by the word take the word release the word speak what you have need of Every Mountain has to move release the word and when you release it it'll be invisible but watch it create a visible victory in your life hallelujah oh yes manifest what does manifest mean manifest means clear to the eye to make evident or certain by showing or displaying a promise isn't manifest until it happens now if I'm speaking about the past I just want to differentiate the two and I tell you something happened that did not happen that that's just a that's a flat out lie not only is it not true it's a lie lie has a lot to do with intention I tell you this happened this happened this happened it didn't that's a lie we know everything that God has said happened has happened it is the truth but when we're speaking of future anything that I tell you is going to happen the truth of that is yet to be determined you can't tell me if it's a lie or the truth till we get to the appointed time the appointed day and whether or not I told you what was going to happen happens or not no matter what it it it doesn't happen then it wasn't true regardless of my intention I don't mean I was lying but if I tell you because it may have been in man I'm going to come help you do this on Monday and then I'll my car breaks down I didn't show up now I was going to but I did not therefore the statement was not true do you follow what I'm saying it wasn't truth because truth is found in the manifestation truth is found in fulfillment do you understand so so so it's not truth if it doesn't happen physical words spoken or written have no truth to them until it happens in other words the the manifestation of those words have to come into something tangible they have to come into fulfillment that's what makes them truth and that goes for everyone that goes for god brother Bram tells us God is only as good as his word he says if God made a promise Pro God's got to keep his promise if he doesn't he isn't God he says that's the way you do with healing throw yourself at his Mercy he promised it it's his word he's got to he's got to fulfill his word if he isn't he isn't God he says in no man's word no man is any better than his word if I don't keep my word I'm not much and if God doesn't keep his word word he isn't God but if God does keep his word how many can testify that God keeps his word but if God does keep his word then he ever remains God in order to be God he's got to keep his word you see he's got to keep his word I'm trying to drill that into you today he's going to keep his word he's going to see you through he's going to do what he promised to do he's never not kept his word he's always going to keep his word he's God he's trustworthy he's a faithful and true witness he's going to keep his word see I can tell you like I said that I'm G to I'm going to come help you do something on Thursday and I can mean it with all my heart and every intention can be perfect and pure and yet due to unforeseen circumstances I'm unable to come through on my promise but what makes God different and I love this as I was studying is his promise can never be derailed by circumstances circumstance can derail what I want to do or what I plan to do but circumstances can never derail what God's plans are because he isn't confined by time he isn't confined by space then his promises are not subject to circumstance because he speaks them from a place of already happened think about it he doesn't say I'm going to heal you so there's a chance it can be derailed he says you are healed I have saved you I have delivered you I have come down he's not even speaking of I will he's telling you what I've already done the promise can't be broke he's already fulfilled it he already took the stripes he already healed you he already delivered you it's already done how can circumstance derail something that's finished hallelujah hallelujah you're already saved you're already going to Rapture you've already been healed the work's already finished it can't be derailed you can't fall away You're predestinated to it Hallelujah he says I healed you I saved you I delivered you I was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world by whose Stripes you were healed he's already fulfilled the promise that he's given you even if it still is invisible to your eyes but the invisible is going to become visible Hallelujah it may be unseen right now it may still be be somewhere you can't quite see it it may be blurry off in the distance but the Unseen is going to be manifest because the word has been released and it has already accomplished its goal go right Hallelujah what's that mean brother Aaron that means you're dealing with a defeated enemy he's already fought the War he's already defeated the War I mean how silly would it sound if I came to you and said guys listen we really got to defeat the Nazis in World War II I I'm worried about this brother Joe we got to stop them if we don't guys we done fought that war they're already a defeated enemy there may be imagery and there may be hate speech and things that linger from it and come and try to rise its ugly head up again but they have been defeated I'm telling you Satan's defeated death is defeated sickness is defeated depression is defeated the grave is defeated It's Already Done he's a defeated enemy this morning and now you're just waiting for the Unseen to become manifest in your life which it will Hallelujah we can Rejoice today that the Unseen will be made manifest yes hallelujah what good does it do us what good does it do is to talk about the Miracles if he isn't still a miracle worker he's an eternal god with an eternal word what good is it to talk about the blood if the blood's lost its power what good is it to to re to recount the promises if they aren't any good anymore I need God today I mean don't get me wrong I'm super thankful that the Red Sea opened for the Israelites I I'm happy for him man I'm super thankful for every person that that received a touch in the prophet of God's meetings I'm I'm happy you it showed God alive it manifested the invisible but I need God today yeah it it's something to me that the very theme of our message was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and yet we want to change him well he's the same yesterday today forever except for the way he manifest himself in the services except for the fact that we don't need prayer lines no more well I just look at like feels good enough for the prophets good enough for me I mean maybe you've risen above his level I'm just saying if it was good enough then it's good enough now if God healed then God heals now if God manifested in gifts then he'll manifest in gifts now God is God in every single way brother Brown would tell us in every single detail except his Corporal body nothing's changed then what's changed not him not him he's the same and we need him to be the same he he's still God his word is still true every promise will come to pass exactly as he said it will now here's the thing I want you to get I'm not telling you that that this is what brings Faith it's faith in the Unseen that makes it seen do you understand what I'm saying I'm not saying we have to see in order to believe it's faith in the invisible is what's going to make it visible it's faith when you don't see faith comes by hearing but we hear and we believe and therefore we will see it manifests itself it doesn't remain invisible brother brandham tells us he says now if God makes a promise in the Bible and then if you receive that the supernatural promise will make a supernatural manifestation Hallelujah because God will vindicate his word absolutely Hallelujah he will vindicate it absolutely we can stop and rejoice right there whatever you're holding on to whatever piece of that word he's the Lord God that Health thee you're holding on for the Holy Ghost the promise is unto you you're holding on for a prodal he will vindicate his word absolutely it's a supernatural promise you hold on and a supernatural manifestation will take place I don't know how it's going to happen me neither because it's supernatural if you could figure it out it wouldn't be it's all Supernatural Well I don't see how this is going to happen this is going to happen me neither don't have to it's a great point don't got to figure it out all I got to do is have faith in the Unseen and the Unseen will become visible and manifest itself in a victory in my life his word is always made manifest we know faith comes by hearing we know that and we believe that we do not have to see the Bel but we're going to see because we have heard and we believed that's the reason why and we have example after example in the scriptures of those who would look to the Unseen with faith and therefore the Unseen became seen Noah saw the waters Fallen by faith before they ever fell never seen a cloud before nothing but blue skies I'd like about a week of that I'm sure it's coming in August and I'll be like where's the clouds but I'm just talking about right now never seen rain before nothing but blue skies but God released a word that said it's going to rain now at that point there's no turning back that word has been released and it didn't matter that it took 120 years brother Aaron I've been battling this so long that's part of it I told you at the beginning we're time creatures we're dealing with time how many days have I been sick how many weeks how how long have they been out of church how long has this marriage been in this Con time no the word's been released wait for the manifestation and hold on and expect it it was a word that that remained invisible for 120 years but at the time appointed it became visible and because Noah believed that God's word must come to pass then he was prepared for it now that's the thing I want to stop and say something about about real quick is how much action you go into after you receive the promise shows whether or not you truly believe the promise Noah could have said for 120 years I believe it's going to rain and he could have preached it but had he not buil the ark it would have proved he did not believe it was going to happen how much you're preparing to receive what you're asking for shows how much you believe you think about Zachariah and the Temple when when the angel came and told him about John's birth do you realize that that's what Zachariah had been praying for they'd been praying for it and the angel comes and says well you're going to get it and he goes can't be think about are we expecting to receive what we've asked for I you know how it is maybe I'll take guys men and women if you got company coming over a big thing going on on the weekend and you know what's going to happen you're expecting it you may get out there and mow the yard do some weed eating tidy up do some stuff wife may be in there cleaning the house you get it why you're expecting that Saturday at noon there's people showing up you're expecting it and you're expecting them to walk through the door because they told you they were and you believe them you believe them what kind of Life ought we to be living brother Joe I believe God's coming back and you ain't got you ain't got no consecration got no sincerity can't come to the house of God regularly no you don't oh yes I do you can't tell me I don't believe yes I can your action on the promise tells me whether or not you [Music] believe do you get prepared to receive it are you expecting not hoping expecting to receive it I'm not hoping my guest show up I'm expecting cuz they said they were listen he said he was was going to show up he said he was going to move he said he was coming back I'm expecting it I'm preparing for it I'm putting my all into it I believe you Lord he's coming back just like he [Applause] said expectation means to believe that someone or something will arrive soon this word don't don't fail we ought to be under expectation every single day every single service today is the Fulfillment today is my Deliverance today is the manifestation of what I've been praying for didn't happen that's okay today is you wake up the next day today I'm under expectation we should live under expectation thus far it's unseen by my natural eye but I'm expecting because I know the word will bring the promise into manifest estation for 25 years the the promised son was only visible in a confession it was only visible by faith but there was coming a time where Abraham would hold that confession in his arms it had to be made manifest he would hold the confession in his arms listen that's what I'm preaching to you this morning the promises must have an actual fulfillment the promises must actually come to pass God is God he keeps his word if he made a promise it's going to happen brother Aon that's so simple I know we've lost the Simplicity of it it's going to happen it's going to be fulfilled it's going to manifest one day I'm going to hold in my arms the Fulfillment of the promise one day I'm going to have a new body one day I'm going to Rapture one day it's going to happen and I'm looking for it today expectation not because why do they have to come to pass not because I said so because he's God and he said so therefore it must happen he's a faithful he's a true witness and his word cannot be released and forever remain in the state of promise it can't remain forever just as a promise or it's not true there has to come a fulfillment it can't forever remain in the form of spoken word it has to manifest itself but the spoken word will always culminate in the actual manifestation of what was spoken Mary said be it unto me and we celebrate that we celebrate Mary saying be it unto me but what if the child had never come what if nothing came from that be it unto me well be what unto me but what was it according to Thy word and that word was released and even though she didn't feel anything even though she didn't see a change he never leaves his word unfinished unsettled or unfulfilled and it says she didn't wait till she was positive of this she didn't wait till she felt life or some kind of a sensation to prove that she was to be a mother she just took his word and that was a enough said that's the way Miracles are performed Let me back up what happened she took the word that was enough brother Aaron I want to see a miracle I want to see amazing things that's the way Miracles are performed when God is took by his word The Impossibles Are Made Real it's impossible brother Aaron Hallelujah I got the Cure it's possible today you don't understand I got the remedy take him out his word take him out his word anchor down on that word today and watch The Impossible be made manifest in your life I can't I can't okay he can I can't do it well let me ask you this all I need you to do is by faith believe his word oh brother Aon but my Faith's so weak it's so tiny I'm glad you brought that up because you only need the faith the size of a grain of mustard seed so you are in business prepare for victory prepare for the mountain to move you are a candidate for the miraculous this [Applause] morning I just want to drive that home to you this morning God's word will always be made manifest because he is God his word is truth and in order to remain God he must always keep his word now when we reach this time that we just spoke about here with Mary we come to a place where God becomes flesh and we spoke earlier about his manifestation in the logos but now he further unfolds himself and he F unfolds himself into flesh once again vindicating that the word will always be manifested there was word promising this everything that had happened till now had pointed to this coming there had been promise after promise there had been scripture stacked upon scripture it said that the woman's seed shall bruise the Serpent's head Behold a virgin shall conceive he he will bind up the Brokenhearted he will Proclaim Liberty to the captives and there comes a day where all those scriptures that were ever spoke about him every promise every word all the Old Testament all the word is fulfilled in the man Christ Jesus or can I say manifested or can I say made visible in the man Christ Jesus and at this point at in time God has further unfolded himself from the logos into the man Christ Jesus and Hebrews 1 tells us that he was the express image of God Colossians 1:15 said he was the image of the invisible god brother Bram tells us and Jehovah God the logos who brewed over the Earth and brewed the first man Out of the Dust of the Earth overshadowed Mary and brewed over her to fulfill his word and created the blood cell that brought forth the sun of the Living God I believe in a body he was man I believe in his soul he was God and he was God's manifestation here on the earth God come in flesh Jesus Christ the logos the logos that went out in the beginning how back in the beginning no one could see God then the logos came out then God manifested himself down in man and when this happens Jesus begins a Ministry that does what it's a Ministry that makes God visible his ministry makes God visible he begins a Ministry that unveils what was hidden that manifests the Unseen the invisible God walking up in a body on the Earth just like you and I and still people couldn't see it think about that they could see it but they couldn't see him so he still wasn't visible to everyone but he's the representation the body is the representation of the Unseen God and people looked right at him and couldn't receive it we have to be willing to recognize fulfillment because we can all see the same thing and not see the same thing we have to be willing to recognize fulfilling because it doesn't uh doesn't always come the way we expect it to come sometimes the invisible becomes visible and it doesn't match what we've been taught or the visible becomes the invisible becomes visible and it isn't in our comfort zone it's not where we're real comfortable because before it was made visible we had already figured it all out in our head well God is like this and God's like that and this is how he's going to operate and this is how he's going to move and then we set up parameters and then when he becomes visible we expect him to fit inside those parameters and everything that don't fit inside those parameters we just throw away and we don't accept the Fulfillment of it because it wasn't fulfilled the way we expected it to and that's exactly what happened with the religious leaders uh in that day because in their mind it had to come a certain way it had to come to their group it had to come to the Pharisees or it had to come to the Sadducees or surely he's going to come down to caiaphus and and surely it's going to be this way it has to be exactly the way we taught it it has to be in perfect order the way we expect it and here he comes the word the logos made flesh and they look right at it and said you're of illegitimate birth look right at the Fulfillment and fail or choose not not to recognize the Fulfillment of it and because of their Traditions they couldn't see what was made visible right in front of them edting like Tabernacle let's don't let our ideas our traditions and what we think make us fail to recognize what stands right before us when something happens in a service and we can't recognize it's God moving because it's way easier to say well that's just emotion because I don't worship that way and if they do and that's God then that makes me uncomfortable or somebody does a certain thing or acts in a certain way or a certain healing is testified of when God moves and manifests who he is be willing to recognize and accept the manifestation of God because their Traditions wouldn't let them see it even though as he testified to John's disciples the blind could see the lame can walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf here the dead are raised and the gospel is preached to the poor listen it wasn't just visible flesh it wasn't just flesh walking around going I'm the Son of God I'm the Son of God can't you see me no he was manifesting God on the earth he was doing the works of the Father the invisible was becom invisible right in front of them and he said if you don't believe me look at the works look what's happening he brought God visible because the works were of God he did what only God could do and some there began to recognize but why did they recognize it's because they began to compare it to the word they began to compare it to the word he says one of them would say you know I never thought of it so much until I began to read the scriptures hello it's time we begin to read the scriptures again well I never heard of that and I never seen I it's time we begin to read the scriptures says I began to read the scriptures what Messiah was supposed to be you know there's so many people that don't know how the spirit is supposed to move in a church service because they don't read the scriptures because he was to be that prophet and then I understand that another thing when I see him break that bread and feed those people who could create but God himself so that that has to be Messiah no one can create but God God is the only Creator there is and here he took five little biscuits and two fishes and fed 5,000 taken up seven baskets full the piece is left over when nothing could do that but Jehovah the same one that red brain breed down out of the Skies that's the only one that can do it you know if people today would just take their questions back to the word right instead of to a message board or a text group chat and and spread their questions and their doubt and their unbelief if you really have an honest heart you'll find the answer right here I've always said no Christian Minds people having questions but are they honest questions because when you give someone the answer and their response is yeah I see that but they never wanted the answer their mind was made up before they ever asked you yeah I see what you're saying but what they don't want the answer their mind's made up but if they'll just take it back to the word if they'll take it back to this to settle it compare it to the word we'd have a lot more testimonies and a lot less debates he goes on and says and here he is known Among Us in a humble form of a carpenter an ordinary man here here is the Jehovah that lived in the heavens no one could see him the invisible God is made visible here Among Us for we know him he does the same works that Jehovah did Messiah was supposed to be Jehovah Emanuel God With Us and if I don't do the works of Emmanuel if I don't act like Emanuel my works is not like the Emanuel then I'm not Emanuel but if you can't believe me just watch The Works that I do they testify of who I am listen nothing's changed changed your works better still testify of who he is your Works must testify of who he is he was the very manifestation of the invisible he was the word in the body doing the works of Jehovah and he's saying if you don't believe that's who I am just look at the works I'm doing look at what's being manifested before you it says in John 14:11 believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake oh you can't see me who I really am because of my birth you can't see who I really am because I didn't go to the same College you went to or get educated under the same sect of religion that you did so if you can't receive me because of those things then just look at the works that I'm doing look at how he's being manifested look at how the invisible is being made visible they testify of who I am but as blind as the religious leaders were and as blind as the majority of the people in that day were there were people who began to recognize there were people who began to see there whose eyes began to come open there were people who who began to catch glimpses and say that's right listen there's always always going to be a people who catch it when it comes there's always going to be a people that recognize the word word in their midst that recognize the works in their midst and they say that's God that's Jehovah others can cast it aside and say that's nothing but emotion that's nothing but workup we don't need this we don't need that he's just a carpenter but there's others going I see it that's God that's God that's him right there I see the invisible being made visible in our midst I see it there's always someone who catches it someone who recognizes that that that the life and the works and how do they recognize it because they have the same DNA of deity on the inside of them they recognize those family traits those family traits make sense they're an attribute of the same Source the woman of at at the well had her eyes come open how she recognized the works we know when Messiah comes he will do these things she recognized The Works Nathaniel saw the works he didn't say be elves above there was DNA on the inside of him that said you're the son of the Living God he was from the same Source look at the woman who washed jesus' feet I've always loved this story so much says look how filthy she was but something struck that's my testimony I was filthy look how filthy I was but something struck amen she seen the word of the promise from the Garden of Eden This Woman's seed shall bruise the Serpent's head she seen the Messiah that had been born a virgin she heard he was to be born a virgin but they heard that man was on Earth she heard there was a young Rabbi Prophet who healed the sick she believed that and there she come down the street walking around looking around she looked over there and seen that great party going on she slipped up to the fence looked through and there he was there he was about how easy that is when you come into a service and he moves there he is she didn't say that just looks like that Carpenter Ah that's that's the son of Joseph and Mary you know what I've heard about all that she looked saw him and said there he is something said that's him see that's all she needed to be inspired see what happened she seen the word of God made flesh she had heard with her ear and now she saw with her eyes and what she do she fell down at his feet and she begin to worship and she began to let the oil flow a type of the Holy Ghost and she began to cry and wash his feet with her hair that's how we should all act when we seem in our midst oh I just want to fall down at your feet and worship I want to praise you you've done so much for me you've saved me you've fed me you've healed me you've been there every step of the way I just want to praise you but too many times we act like the Pharisees what gives her the right she's disturbing the service why is it always the same people that do the shouting brother Joe you know how come we don't turn that question around you tell me why is it always the same people why is it never you we've been asking that question wrong for years that's the same one dancing I'm sorry that's your fault not hers that's your fault not his why can't you worship a living God why can't you praise him for what he's done why can't you shout his Praises why is it always the same [Applause] ones well she's out of order could that really be him what if that isn't his Spirit making them act that way what if it's just emotion what if he's just a carpenter but the whole time you're asking your questions and criticizing somebody's washing his feet somebody ain't wasting time they're there praising their lord they're there praising their savior they're there giving them everything they don't care what you think they don't care what I think she she didn't care what anybody in there thought this was her salvation this was her ticket to a new life this was her her her her token to Eternity and she was going to give it praise while you're wondering with all your questions and all your criticisms he's being made visible and you're missing it and then you say I just want to see God no you don't you want to see a God that you've constructed in your mind that fits in your pattern and you want that God to show up you want that God to fit in your box well listen I'm going to tell you God's going to blow the walls out your box and blow the doors wide open he don't fit in your box he moves how he wants to move and he's looking for people that'll receive him when he moves the way he wants to [Applause] move recognize him when he's in our midst know your God enough to know his ways know him enough to recognize his presence commune with him enough to know his voice spend enough time with him so that when he moves and when he does the same things that he's always done when he does something that makes himself visible you can recognize him when he heals the sick that's him when he brings the power to deliver that's him when he saves a sinner that's him when he discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart and repeats your conversation right back to you from the pull pit that's him but the Pharisees says somebody told him he knew I was at church today I didn't even know I was preaching I sure didn't know you was going to be here that's him and when we see something like that happen and we see and move in a way that we recognize let it be just like it was with Copus and those walking on the road to Emmas when he did something just like he had done before he was crucified when they when when they saw him move they said that's him they recognizing they said that that's him he's here he's alive he's moving amongst us and what did it cause him to do well they got up and in order they began their walk back to Jerusalem no it lit a fire on the inside of him and they saw him moveing they said he's here he's alive brother Joe he's moving and even like Tabernacle and to their feet they went and they ran they had to tell somebody they had to Rejoice they had to let it out there was a fire lit on the inside of him recognize him in your midst recognize his manifestation and let him light a fire in your life Welcome him the Pharisees saw what they wanted to see you see what you choose to see others saw a man with a illegitimate birth but others saw God you got to lay aside your ideas this morning and see God today lay aside your preferences and see God today when he moves here I asked you an honest question when he moves here and people shout and people jump and people dance and people scream what do you see I'm going to tell you right now you see what you choose to see and then I'm going to show you what the prophet said it was using those exact same words what do you see what do you judge it as what do you call it because when that happens no matter who it is I choose to see God moving in the hearts of men and women and them responding to it that's what I see just like those on the road to Emmas they ran they shouted they told everybody listen but what do you see the prophet of God says I believe that the same God that fell on the day of Pentecost upon his church as a pillar of fire and divided himself with clothing tongues among his people is here tonight amen it's the same God he was then he is today with the same Holy Ghost I know it's a paradox it can't be explained now everybody stop quit reading because when I read this it kind of shocked me that he used this exact wording 1963 after the seals the word is open and this is what he says emotions oh he's about to blast that all that emotions screaming yeah can't have that that's out of order what good does it do anybody anyway crying and so forth so forth is a lot of stuff there's all kind if I say and so forth I mean all kind of stuff went down cannot be explained but it is a paradox how God does it it's the Unseen God wait no no that's not God you just argue with him when you get there if you get there it's the Unseen God dwelling in the human heart and what is all that emotion screaming shouting and so forth making himself visible by vindicating his word that he is the same yesterday today and forever don't you worry about what anybody thinks your worship makes God visible your worship manifested invisible God you can shout you can scream you can do whatever you want to do in the worship of an invisible God and it makes my God visible it manifests him that's just emotion yep and it manifests my God I say God make me more emotional so I can manifest you better make me more free so I can manifest your your body better here upon the Earth Let My Worship make you visible to others whether they choose to see it or not don't let anybody any anybody make you afraid to worship it don't matter if they see it as just a workup it don't matter if they see it as just emotionalism it makes God visible Jesus let me see what time it is oh we're good thank you Jesus was the word made flesh we know that and his ministry in that body made the invisible God visible the fullness of a godhead in a body but there came a time after he finished everything that he was supposed to fulfill in the body of the groom that he's taken up and that he leaves return to what we would call invisible but he promised that there are certain people that would still be able to see him brother John he wasn't going to be be invisible to everybody he's still going to be visible he tells us in John 14 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not he's invisible to them it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know me for he dwelleth in you and shall be and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more he's invisible but yet you see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am the father and and ye and me and I and ye and you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him I'm GNA make myself known I'm G make myself visible you shall see me he's not invisible to us this morning amen he's not invisible to you and me although he's still the invisible God he's still the invisible God yet we see him we see him through the manifestations of his promises in the Fulfillment of his word and the unveiling of his word and now we can say that the word being made flesh isn't just a 2,000 year ago thing brother Joe we're bringing this down now how is the Unseen going to be manifested in this day because word made flesh isn't just something from 2,000 years ago but in our day the invisible God has been made visible once again in this day in our day in our age the logos that Pillar of Fire the same logos that met Moses in the burning Bush the same logos that met Paul on the road that same logos came down and met a prophet in this day in Houston Texas that same Pillar of Fire is made visible not just to one person but to thousands in attendance and the millions who have seen that picture around the world brother Aaron I want to see the pillar of fire okay walk back there look on that wall and he made sure that we could always and forever see the pillar of Fire he became visible in this day and he began to further unfold himself he unfolded from the logos into Jesus and now once again he's unfolding in this day and he begins to unfold because see there had been a groom that made him manifest there had been a groom that manifested to those that could receive it and then after 2,000 years he comes again in the fullness of his word through the through the promised message of Malachi 4 which unveils him once again to the elect or to the bride he says they believe but they never broke into this yet I'm glad I've broke into this to see that great shika light both spiritual and physical both spiritual and physical in so much that a mechanical eye of the camera keeps taking the picture just two weeks ago caught it again you're revealing yourself Lord the Mighty God unveiled to the believer still veiled the world shall not see me still veiled to the unbeliever but unveiled to the believer you're a Believer this morning you have the opportunity to see him you have the opportunity to look upon him what was it what was this message that came it was the word coming of Christ it was the word coming of Christ and it was for the purpose that the elect might see him once again that that that all that had been hidden would now be revealed and that and that all that had been invisible would now be visible it would now be seen and once again many couldn't receive it many couldn't see it even though they testified that the works were of God you ever thought about all those books that we know those titles you know a man sent from God and a prophet visit South Africa and all all the books that we know of from back in that time period and they would have headlines and say things like Bible days are here again do you realize that message churches didn't exist brother brandham didn't preach the message churches he preached to denominational people mostly in Pentecostal circles but denominational people so what's my point this wasn't message propaganda this wasn't us saying these things this was them the ones that say well he got off he was this oh cult oh this oh false prophet well your discernment was uh on pretty good for a little while because they were the ones saying it's a manent from God Bible days are here again nothing like this has happened since Jesus walked on the shores of Galilee that wasn't us saying that that was them saying that they testified that the works were of God think about it brother brandom could have said you don't think I I'm a messenger for God okay but believe me for the work's sake they testified that the works were from God but those who had Isa those who had the ability to see those that were that were out of the that that came forth out of the same logos word DNA from before the foundation of the world this message made God visible to them it made him plain it it brought the Unseen World into Plain View and it didn't come in word only that's it didn't come in word only it came in power it came in demonstration the gospel was put before the people and shown that this gospel has power yes we need to make sure we get the mechanics lined up right yes we need the doctrines lined up right yes those things are important but with without the Dynamics it's no good and brother brandham knew that and brother brandham taught that and he stood there and he corrected Doctrine and then he demonstrated the Dynamics that would come with a word properly placed it didn't come in word only but our eye our ears have heard but we can also say brother Joe that our eyes have seen he says did did he do it just exactly the way he said he would do it now how many believes he's the same yesterday today and forever sensing his presence now you've seen his presence now you've seen his presence now your eye has seen your ears have understood and God has confirmed before your eyes his presence and that what you feel all the time that condemns you when you're wrong and tells you not to do that that same God has become visible ible to you here this afternoon where where is he visible well brother Aaron he's visible in just in it's in his word well in 1965 brother Bram makes clear that the reason he's become visible and how he's become visible is where in his Works believe if you can't accept what I'm telling you you should at least believe it for the work's sake in his works and yet that wasn't the end of his unfolding that word coming as mighty and as wonderful it was that wasn't the purpose the purpose of the word coming wasn't just for the word coming kind of like we say this the purpose of God sent a prophet wasn't just so God could send a prophet there was a purpose for the word coming there was a further unfolding that had to take place the word coming was to produce the bride coming a further unfolding and the bride coming that the word coming came to produce the bride coming to produce a bride for Christ a match piece for him something that matched him perfectly well I'm getting ahead of myself here but if he In the Flesh manifested the invisible God in his day and the bride matches him perfectly bone of his bone flesh of his flesh power of his power then what are we here to do we are here to make the Unseen manifested we're here to make the invisible become inv visible we're here to do the works of Jesus Christ we're not just here to say I believe a message I'm following a prophet but we're here to manifest Christ to a d World manifest his Works to a d world and say there is a living God look you can see him in his works the same works that I do shall you do also why to make the invisible God visible here amongst us hallelujah a match piece because it's God's desire to be manifested that his life be visible he doesn't want to remain where nobody can see he wants his life manifested he wants his life portrayed that's a that's the desire of his heart even from the beginning when there was nothing if we go back to that he wanted all those attributes he wanted them displayed he he wanted them manifested that his life would become visible and it was manifested in different ways down through the Old Testament all culminating in the groom Jesus Christ and when he came forth it it manifested God in a body but here we are like I said 2,000 years later and God once again is in a body God once again is in a body and it's made up of all the attributes that he had in him before the foundation of the world all those attributes which were invisible think about it you were invisible but just like all of God's word they came to manifestation in due time what are you telling me brother Aaron I'm telling you you're right on time you're right where you're supposed to be doing exactly what you're supposed to do he said I choose you to go into Satan's Eden and manifest my life in the worst day in the darkest day I want you to shine a light that says there's a living God when they say there's no healer I want you to manifest the Healer when they say there's no Deliverance I want you to manifest the Deliverance when they say I don't move that way anymore I want your worship to make me visible and see that the Holy Spirit still operates the way it always operated said you're right on time now do what you were called to do and manifest the invisible God hallelujah your job is to make God visible manifesting the Unseen God he says then what does that you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men a part of God's word seated together manifested the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you amen no leaven among you just the word only seated in Heavenly places in the door where he put his name Christ Jesus no leaven among you that brings come on now that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it in the Pentecost AG if you'll look closely while we're reading this this is adoption but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back to the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he manifested on the earth in the form of prophet God Oh Glory promised by Malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures who are we we are Christ manifested where is Christ visible where are the works of Christ being done in you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you the full godhead the full deity everything couldn't be done in Luther couldn't be done in Wesley but he unfolded it in this day to make himself visible amongst you you Tabernacle the logos you manifesting Jesus you making the invisible God visible it he shows himself to us and through us hallelujah it's the day of manifestation that we're living in right look around you I don't mean literally right now but you can if you want I meant generally speaking in life dayto day look around it's the day of manifestation Satan is being manifested on every hand that tree is coming to maturity it's bearing its fruit his works his lies his anointing until there's a people on Earth who are physical representations of hell but there's another group I'll call him the bone of his bone group The Flesh of his flesh group The Power of his power group The be it unto me group and they have gisen to a point to where they're manif in his works his truth his anointing his healing they're manifesting Jesus Christ here upon the Earth hell is being manifested and Heaven's being manifested and let me go ahead and tell you which one wins Heaven is more powerful than hell our groove conquered death hell and the grave we're the winners our manifestation Will Conquer that manifestation hell is being manifested Heaven's being manifested a Rapture is going to be manifested Jesus Christ walking on Earth in body again doing what he's always done [Music] hallelujah hallelujah doing the same things he did because he is manifested in her he says then at the end of the messages see the action of the great Holy Spirit see him come down visible before people even taking pictures of it see it working and showing that it's not a man it's not a preacher it's not a certain congregation it's the Holy Spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ now it's embodied in the body of his bride it should throw us into desperation and what kind of people ought we to be what type of ministry ought we we're to be his match piece we're to be living like he lived overcoming like he overcame Conquering the way he conquered doing exactly what it is he did it should throw us into a desperation what type of life should I be living because the promises of God cannot and will not remain invisible scripture cannot remain invisible it must come to pass it must be fulfilled the scriptures about Jesus eventually had to have skin on them John 14:12 eventually got to have skin on it Mark 16's eventually got to have skin on it the scriptures about a church without spotter wrinkle eventually has to have skin on it and I believe I'm looking at people with skin on them that manifest that scripture in this day am man all the word coming with skin on it again manifesting the truth bearing the same fruits that he bore he said if I do not the works of my father so what are we supposed to look at the fruits look at the life I'm obviously no farmer or any such thing but I'll give a simple illustration the way brother brandham would if you if you take a look at an orange tree that tree isn't the life it's just a visible manifestation of the life just like my body is the visible manifestation of my soul of who I am it's a visible manifestation of the life and when it puts forth a branch you can see the life of that vine in the fruit of the branch the orange that grows on that orange tree tells me there's life there and I see a manifestation or a representation of that life I can see it with my eyes the orange lets me know that the Unseen life of the vine is there there's life in that tree there's life and I want to say that there's life in the bride because what are we connected to we're connected we're connected to the vine we're the branches but I see the fruit I see changed lives I see Life there to overcome I see Life there to change I see Life to bring Victory I see Life to overcome I see Life to Rapture your life the fruit that you Bear shows me that the life is there because the life is shown forth in the fruits him living the same life through her fulfilling his word through her he said Jesus did the works of his father because the father was in him that is why the works was done because the father was in the son do you believe that that in him he was the Incarnate God do you believe that that God the Father which is the father of Jesus Christ the great spirit dwelt in the fullness of his power in Jesus Christ which was the Tabernacle of God made flesh and dwelt on the earth representing going back to the logos the word representing the word word Jesus was the word the Bible said so St John 1 Chapter and the Word was invisible now listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh and when the word become visible and through his sacrificial death at Calvary and his resurrection positionally placed his church in that realm that the same invisible God could come into the individual that's right could come into the individual idual and make the word visible oh my I wish my church could get that we're going to read it again because if brother brandham thought it was that important through his sacrificial death at Calvary and his resurrection positionally plac his church in that realm that the same invisible God could come into the individual and make the word visible oh my I wish my church could get that if you could see friends the invisible God made visible hallelujah what are we doing here brother Aaron do you see God I see him all around me this morning I see God manifested in flesh I see Overcomers just like Jesus I see people walking through Satan's eaten stomping on this devil stomping on that devil Victory here Victory there overcoming each and every day I see Jesus I see God made manifest here amongst us Hallelujah he say gracious God who brought again the lord Jesus thy son from the dead and has presented him to us after 2,000 years we see him day after day and night after night in The Invisible body of his working in the visible body of his church what is this body it's a restored body this body of this church it's a restored body a true representation ation of Jesus Christ upon the earth a body that has come as it were a toddler or or or baby toddler under Luther and then there was growth as it went into Wesley childhood there was growth but it didn't reach maturity then Aza came there was growth there was a greater portion unfolded but it was still only an adolescent body it had not come to maturity but then the fullness came the full maturity and the shook separates from the seed and he says adoption time when God can pour out his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go into a Rapture think about it there wasn't one thing that Jesus didn't fulfill that was said about him there isn't one promise given to you or about you that you're not going to fulfill can you believe that can you accept that this morning can you begin to recognize who you are and what you're called for just bear with me for about five minutes as we're going to bring this down to a close because the invisible the Unseen is becoming manifest in our day and you're a part of that prophet of God says well how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride my goodness read that again how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to proving it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then don't the bride have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she would be in these last days don't she have to return through Malachi 4 don't she have to be manifested like it was in the days of Sodom don't the world have to be just exactly like it is isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of God made known unto us the invisible God in our day made manifest the Unseen made manifest who are you who are you little bride think about I hope it's took hold today who you are and what you're to do you are the Bride of Jesus Christ called in this day to be a match piece to the groom and to do the works and continue the ministry and make the invisible God in this day visible the manifestation of all the promises that's who you are who are you you're the manifestation of all the promises you're the culmination of the whole thing take it back to the beginning when there was nothing there was nothing no space no time no stars why did he do it all you and here you are manifested at the time that he wanted you to be manifested and now you are the body that makes Christ visible not just that you're the body that's going to overcome hell you're the body that's overcoming and Satan's eating you're the body that's going to take a rra not another group you it's you today part of him representing him flesh of his flesh bone of his bone the word of God made manifest in you today well brother a and I I just can't see it all yet I can't see it all my promises I I get a glimpse every now and then but I just can't I struggle I'm want to promise you again as we come to a close I'm going to promise you that the Unseen your promises will be made manifest the invisible will be made visible every promise every word and I'm telling you that there's been a word spoke about you and right now it may be invisible you've heard it you believe it but it's invisible you just can't grasp it you just can't see it there are promises made about you words spoke about you and it may not be seen yet and it may be invisible to your eyes but the manifestation is coming the manifestation looks down to it and says oh you Overcomer you conqueror you healed you delivered You Victorious listen when he said let there be light light was coming when he said there's an Earth Earth was coming I'm telling you your promise is coming your Victory is coming your children they're coming you're healing it's coming why because it's already done and we're here to step into it we're here to manifest it we're here to say that's mine that's mine there it is I see it I see it that's mine it was invisible but now it's visible I see it the Rapture is an invisible promise but it's coming the body change is an invisible promise but it's coming Hallelujah the Unseen will be made manifest in The Bride of Jesus Christ in this last day I say grab a hold to it and say that's mine that's me that's who I am that's what I'm going to do I'm going to manifest the invisible hallelujah hallelujah will you stand together with me than lordo I don't know how else to say it other than Satan don't stand a chance hell never stood a chance death never stood a chance sickness doesn't stand a chance it's already done Satan's Eden doesn't stand a chance we're more than conquerors brother Aon he questions me he questions me all the time or are you can you will you that's okay he questioned Jesus if thou be every manifestation through the Old Testament was questioned well is that God is it not could it be what if and then Jesus comes he's just a carpenter illegitimate and Satan can't be him can't be brother Joe that can't be him look at him he's just a man he's just a man and then he killed him hung him on a cross and I knew it wasn't him I knew it wasn't him but let me tell you what what he could see became seen that day when Jesus stepped up and kicked in the doors of hell every question was answered on that day the question was answered let them question you let them doubt you can't be you that can't be her that can't be her but one day we're going to blow the doors off of Satan's even when we leave here and it's going to answer every question it's her
