prayer father Lord we just want to say how much we love you and appreciate you and thank you Lord for your goodness your mercy in our lives Lord Watching Over Us Lord many times Lord we would have passed on or things would have happened in our lives that took us out of here but Lord you was there for us and he was watching over us and we're thankful for that we asked the Lord that you would just come in this service Lord and you wouldn't touch hearts and touch lives and minister to needs Lord is only you can do we remember Lord the other ones that are ministering our pastor Lord Brother Joe as well and brother Aaron as well Lord God just be with him today in the services we pray we commit our hearts to you and our lives to you and thank you for this opportunity to serve you in this time we're living in in Jesus name amen amen let's turn our Bibles First Corinthians 10. and verse 12 it's Amen good to be back home with you again and and uh as I said it's you know you enjoy going to other places and seeing other people but there's still no place like home and uh we're glad to be home and and glad to be able to be a service today I actually had a bit of a sometimers or Old-Timers moment um I was studying this out on first of last week up to about Wednesday about 2 30 and then I was actually my sister Lydia called me and she said are you preaching today I said what are you doing to some studying she said you're preaching today I said yes she said I thought brother Joe was preaching tonight I said well he sure is and so uh I went closed my stuff up went took a nap amen and so uh but anyway the Lord saw fit that we would speak it this morning and so amen he knows how to orchestrate things and and what to do it's all in his hands and his control and we're just glad to be a vessel used of him amen First Corinthians 10 and verse 12 says wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there has no temptation taking you but such is common to man but God is faithful aren't you thankful he's faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear it amen we let you be seated this morning I'd like to speak to you on the late determined to fulfill amen I I believe we ought to be a people of determination because God is a god of determination and you know uh this determined means having reached a decision or firmly resolved it's synonyms for it is decisive it's purposeful it's Resolute it's resolved it's single-minded it's steadfast it's tenacious is decided firmed firm fixed persevering set settled buckled down constant Earnest meaning business solid strong-minded unfaltering unflinching unhesitating and unwavering I think that's some wonderful descriptions of Our Lord amen because I believe he is decided and he he doesn't change his decisions but what he has decided to amen about us he's going to continue on is not going to change and I I really appreciate a god like that because how difficult it would be to serve a God that you didn't know if one moment he loved you and the next moment he didn't or one moment he was his and the next moment you wasn't but if you were his before the foundation of the world you will always be his it doesn't matter what you're going through or what you're going the circumstances of life because he does not change it's what he said in his word he said I the Lord do not change therefore o children of Jacob are not consumed in other words if I change my mind about you amen you would not exist amen but I I I do not change my mind if I called you it says in the place God is not a man that he should lie or this or son of man or son of man that he should change his mind in other words he'd what he what is in his mind or what is in his thoughts is constant it it remains he's not double-minded amen he's single-minded and it says as the grass from another place says it's a grass wither and the flower Fades but the word of our God will stand forever in other places said oh of old you laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of your hands they will perish but you will remain they will all wear out like a garment you will change them like a robe and they will pass away but you are the same and your years have no end in other places it says heavens and Earth will pass away but my words will not pass away so God's word is firm it's a firm foundation it's a firm place you can stand upon and he has a determination to fulfill this word amen so he does not change his word according to the circumstances but he'll change the circumstances according to his word amen it says in Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen a few places brother Randall would say it like this he said God is determined and when God makes us up his mind to do anything it will be Hallelujah God is determined and when God makes up his mind to do anything it will be for God is determined that his table will be will be set and there will be somebody there God will have his table full amen God has never changed he's just the same today as he was he always been and God when God is determined to do something he will do it and nothing will stop him he will do it so this God does not what does not allow circumstances to change his mind this God does not allow pressures of the world or the things of this world to change his word or to change his mind God does not allow sin to change his word God does not allow the how great the sin gets and how bad it gets Amen to change his word but his word will remain the same no matter what the circumstances are no matter what the situation is amen no matter what the problem is no matter what's going on around him he's going to remain the same and I I believe as Believers if we are truly Born Again of the spirit of God we also have those attributes in US amen therefore we can have a determination we can have a stability about us we can have amen our settleness about us we can buckle down and press through the hard times of life and and be constant and and Earnest and mean business and strong-minded and also be unfaltering and also be unflinching and unhesitating and unwavering I believe that don't you if you have amen the seed of God on the inside of you then you also have his attributes and if God has the attributes of being unchanging we should also have the unwavering or whatever we should also have those same attributes inside of us amen he would say it like this in James 1 and verse 5. it says if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and unbraideth not and it shall be given him and let him ask in faith nothing wavering amen have faith not wavering not not deciding well he's not going to hear me he's not going to understand me you know many times we talk ourselves out of it before God's even gave the answer amen many times we've talked ourselves out of it amen before God has been given the chance to come on the scene and move on our behalf amen it's just like the man one time I heard the story of a man who had to blow out and he was out in the middle of nowhere and he sees one little light up there you know on the hill and you probably heard the story see one little light on the hill an old farmer out there and he he said well maybe I don't have a jack I don't have a tire tool I don't have nothing maybe he can help me but it's midnight and he he said but maybe he won't care and he starts walking up there but his mind began to do battles with him and he's like man this man is going to be upset he's going to be mad he's going to be mad I woke him up he's going to be mad because he didn't get no sleep he'd been out there doing this and doing that got the bed late going to get up early and he's probably gonna pull a gun he's probably going to and four and what boy got up there he almost had talked himself out of it but his mind just kept saying kept pushing in this way and he gets up and actually goes and knocks on the door but he's done talked himself into the place to where this man has going to be mad at him and he's going to tell him no and and he's going to he's going to rebuke him and he then the man the farmer gets out of his bed he comes answers the door and the man says keep your old Jack anyhow amen why because he was unstable he he done talked himself into a situation and the man didn't even have a chance to help him without him already being talked out of it many times we come to God the same way amen before we can give Before the Throne of God we begin to flavor in our faith when we begin to waver and say well God doesn't love me God doesn't care about me God doesn't understand what I'm going through and he's not going to he's got he's too busy for me he's got this going on just keep your own promises anyhow listen we got to have faith and without wavering amen we got to have faith to walk up to the door and knock and keep on knocking that God's going to answer me that God will not change his love towards me that I am his son and he won't deny himself and God's going to answer what I have need of amen I ask him in faith nothing wavering for he that is waver he that waverth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so it's not just in the way of the law of truth but it's also unstable in every part of your life you're unstable in what you do in your work you're unstable in how you operate in your family you're under unstable in every part and it starts with faith amen James writing of the double the doubting person is he that's like a wave of the sea and is blown and tossed by the wind that man should think he should that man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord because he's a double-minded man unstable in all that he does he says a doubter is a double-minded person Jesus had in mind such a person when he spoke of one who tries to serve two masters therefore he is unstable one day he's wanting to serve this one the next day he's wanting to serve that one he's unsteady he's wavering in both his character and feelings amen a double-minded person is restless and Confused in his thoughts and his actions and his behavior such a person is always in conflict with himself amen one torn by such inner conflict can never lean with confidence on God and His gracious promise amen the term unstable is as a drunken man unable to walk a straight line he is so defined that he he is no defined Direction and as a result he never gets anywhere such a person is unstable in all that he does this is what Jesus would talk about a double-minded man he said in Luke chapter 9 and verse 57 said it came to pass that as they went though in the way a certain man said unto him Lord I will follow thee weather thy goeth and Jesus said on him foxes have holes birds have air that have out there have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and he said to another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father and he said let the dead bury their dead but go down and preach the kingdom of God and another said Lord I will follow thee but let me go bid them farewell which are at my home at the house and Jesus said unto them no man having put his hand to the plow looking back is fit for the kingdom of God Amen so when you put your hand to the gospel you never look back amen it doesn't matter if this one goes with you or that one goes with you or families walk away or this or that and the other my mind is set on Jesus Christ my mind is set upon his promises and I will fulfill the word that is spoke about me I will fulfill what God has ordained me to fulfill in this hour well the brand I'm going to say it like this he said if you have if you need any need whatsoever that God is Promised in his Bible he's here tonight to meet that need no need seeking further his presence is here his spirit is here and he's willing now Hallelujah and ready and longing to give you what you've been seeking for but when you come to him don't come as a floater don't come as a floater and I you know I go up there and try it and see if it works you'll never get nowhere he said when you come come with this kind of determination this kind of determination that you have sold out locked Stock and Barrel and when you you're tired of the world the sin and unbelief and frustration and doubt and you're coming to a living God with an anchor surely tied to the Rock of Ages and the Holy Spirit is here to pull you into the presence of the Living God that will give you a faith that'll overcome anything ever sickness ever disease and even death itself if you'll come with that kind of determination not just floating around and floating up here and now come with a determination that tonight this is going to end today this is going to be the finish at this moment I'm going to receive something from God Amen he said another place he said they have never found a better way for a baby to get what it wants and cry for it he said if you give them a bail and say junior you're only three days old but now when when you want it when you want your bottle raise up this Bell and ring it see if it works it won't work a baby cries for what he wants that's God's provided way amen he said don't whip the little fella he's only following God's provided way he wants something that's right it's the only way he knows how to call his mother scream for it and cry for it he said God recommends this for his children how many children we got here in the building this God recommends us for his believing children he did not intellectual speeches not some great theology amen he wants you to cry out for your need that's right cry out but if you're too stiff and start you you'll never get it if you're ready to limber yourself up a little bit and cry out gotta give it to you he likes to hear his children cry cry your needs unto God God wants it that's his provided way amen that's the way he wants you to cry cry how long how long does a baby cry until he gets what he wants until he gets satisfied he said that's the way of believing Christians should do God's child if you see God made a promise don't give up on it cry until it's answered Hallelujah cry to you see God Vindicated his word and prove it right here you don't have to cry no more you got it walk away and thank him until you do that scream out till you get it [Music] scream out to get it you said you know he said but you got to be persistent about it he said not a hybrid plant not one that has to be babied and petted and packed around Christians are real genuine born articles of God they fight for their position hello somebody a fight until they're finished on this Earth every move of theirs is a fight must I be carried on flowery bed of ease While others fought the prize to win through bloody Seas no no we gotta fight God told Moses he'd give him the land he told Joshua every place the foot or sole of your feet Treads I'll give it to you they had to fight for every inch of it so do you it isn't something to be babied and petted around well I'll take you over there and see what you think about it you pass your opinion that's no way to come come with a determination come in every service with a determination I mean if you're not going to come with a determination why come why go to the effort to get up and take a shower get dressed Drive 30 minutes or whatever it is amen and just come and sit there as a floater and just say well what will be will be no sir I'm coming with a determination I'm coming with a God's going to fulfill his word to me this morning God's going to speak to me God's going to touch me God's going to minister to me come that you're going to stay till it's over stay there till God answers he said a man that believes in God can see the presence of God fill the presence of God since the presence of God and know he's here he's here to answer anything and everything that he may promise for in this day then cry till you get it how easy we give up you know we give up so easy we we our service can come and and things can happen and we just said well maybe another time yeah maybe next service it'll happen maybe maybe over here maybe maybe this will be you know come with a determination doesn't matter if it's a good song service or not it doesn't matter if this is right or that's wrong it doesn't matter I come for one thing I come to get something from God amen you know I I was I was telling the church there in North Carolina the other day I said listen Church ain't all about you but you should be all about church amen it's the truth you know if we come with that determination that I'm going to get something from God then we wouldn't worry about all the other nonsense around us we wouldn't worry about all the other stuff going on around us but we'll say God I got to receive something from you I need life I need strength I need courage I need this in this moment I've got to have an answer and you're ready to push through all the doubts and all the worry and all the discouragement and all the problems around you well you said well I got a lot of disappointments well God lets disappointments happen direct quote God lets disappointments happen to show victory Hallelujah if you could only see that if you could only see these things that seem to be burning you and upsetting you and trials that are going on they are things to stand still and focus your glasses on the word of God and speak the word of God and just walk forward that's all there is to do he says he said you believe that these things be of God well it depends on what you think what you think about it if you believe it to be the Lord Jesus what he said he would do the same things that I do you say he did that sure and look he looked into this audience perceiving their thoughts told them different things is that right the Scripture it read that it reads that way in the Blessed Bible that we know that our lord Jesus is raised from the dead and he visited his people and called the Gentiles out just before he calls the Jews and rejects the Gentile church that were they were under inspiration flee that that was the inspiration Fleet of Christ as quick as you can don't be double-minded amen he says another place he said after death Faith sees the resurrection a god of Resurrection That's The Power of Faith to believe he said when he's standing over there behind the Dark Cloud that you can't see with your natural eyes but Faith he and he said let me back up he said he is standing over there behind that dark cloud that you can't see with your natural eyes but Faith standing by right by you directs you to him hello amen the God of all wisdom who is ordained your path he's standing just behind every trial yeah to know that Peter said that every trial is worth more to us than gold for its working every son that comes to God must first be tried and scores and chastised and if you'll get a little heartache after you get born again a little trial that upset you somewhere and you run back to the world again it shows you wouldn't a child to begin with and you become an illegitimate child and not a child of God he said but if a man once anchors his heart in the heart of Calvary all devil is in hell will never Shake him out of it no more he's there he's there for amen for he that cannot stand chastise me he's an illegitimate child he claims God to be his father when he's not just tossed about by ever when the doctor not stable don't know where you're going double-minded and a lot of times double tongued and don't know where you're standing or what you're talking about then a man that's born the spirit of God knows exactly where he's at nothing phases him because something inside of him has already witnessed somebody is just on the other side of that cloud Hallelujah somebody is on the other side of that cloud so you know whether Brandon would preach perseverance preaching a lot of places many different ways many different times referred to it some some in different places he said I love this word perseverant he said it means to be persistent in making a goal yeah and there's only one goal we're really truly worried about as a Christian that's the rapture that's Eternal things and eternal things of Eternal benefits he said but to be this you must be fully persuaded and persistent and then you can be perseverant he said I think that's the attitude that all Christians should be in at all times yep got my heart burnt too amen I think that's the attitude that all Christians should be in at all times be perseverant a man through all ages that has faith in what they're trying to achieve has always been perseverant electric electricity is here because a man was persevered Carr you jump it's here because a man 's a variant think about anymore in your daily life is here upon this Earth because somebody was perseverant they tried this and it wouldn't work they tried that and it wouldn't work and try this over here and it wouldn't work but finally they found something that would work amen you fly an airplane because somebody was perseverant it was somebody bold enough to say hey I believe as we watch those birds man can do that also and so they tried this and it would crash they'd try that and it would crash and they finally tried something it would die for a little while and they would Tinker with this and Tinker with that why because they were perseverance so now today you're in getting a tube and go all over the Earth in just a few moments what used to take months and sometimes even over almost years to get over to the other side at one point was never thought thinkable it was never even thought of but now this Earth is so small because man and their perseverance has found ways to make it smaller you know it's amazing I I I'm sorry I I live in this age and I still get amazed that I can pick up my phone and even talk to my daughter and just down in Florida and I can see your face and she can see mine and we can have a conversation or you can do that anywhere around the world it's incredible but it was because somebody was perseverant it was because somebody amen had the faith to believe it was possible there was somebody that had that had the faith to believe that we can have electricity we don't have to have a candle all the time and just light it by fire a little dim light no we can have better in that so somebody had the faith to believe in that Faith gave them a persistence to continue until they found what they were looking for Hallelujah he said if you can be persevering and have faith in what you're trying to achieve you will achieve it you got the first have faith before you can be perseverance so faith and perseverance Works hand in hand together they are brothers you know I was going to say this to the end but I I believe right now because I just seeing what he said right there this whole start this whole thing started because Sunday night me and sister Ruth and sister Katie and sister Rebecca that was with us would travel part way home and I'd in a motel and I was studying for Wednesday night and somebody I don't even know who it was I don't I don't even think I know just some random email sent me some group sent me this email and I just I don't know I normally I just hit delete and send them to the delete file but I got to reading it faith Works hand in hand with persistence but you got to have faith to be persistent amen so the God would have to give us something to have faith so we can be persistent so he had placed in his word and he'd show his word does not change so therefore we have a firm foundation that we can stand upon as we just read the word the word said he will not put more on you than which you can bear but he will make a way of Escape so when you're going through a trial that word gives you the persistence to take another step to keep going because you know at any moment there's a way of Escape [Applause] you know at any moment the door is going to open and God's going to change the season that you're in God's going to change the moment that you're going through but this this right here was just I sent a joke though me and about I want to tear the motel room apart but during a study a heart in Harvard Harvard University in the 1950s Dr Kurt Richard placed rats in a pool of water to test how long they could tread water on average they'd give up and sink after 15 minutes but right before they gave up due to exhaustion he would pluck them out the researchers would pluck them out dry them off let them rest for a few minutes and put them back in the water for a second try on the second try how long you think they lasted any guesses some of y'all told the story so I don't want to know y'all guess I mean how long do you think they might have last William how long 10 15 minutes a good guess that's what he said how long do you think 15 minutes 10 minutes five minutes no 60 hours yeah that's not an error that's right 60 hours of swimming and the conclusion drawn from this study at Harvard amen was sin as it was now this clear this conclusion drawn was that since the rats believed they would eventually be rescued they pushed their bodies way past what they previously thought possible and he said I want to leave you with this thought if hope can cause exhausted rats to swim long and then why he said what could faith give to a son of God to realize before you go down God's going to pull you out Hallelujah before you go down and defeat brother Johnny God's gonna pull you out before you go down God's going to make a way of Escape I thought oh God if God if God could place something on the inside of a rat to believe in a Fickle human being was going to reach down in time to pick them up how much more so the Church of the Living God will live we're going to press to the mark of the High Calling amen why because before we can go down and defeat God's going to snatch us out [Applause] but this church will not fail remember who you are and why you're here keep swimming amen well I hope you got the faith of a rat Mercy we think faith is some big thing off there a rat can obtain it did it not done I'll just read it to you a belief that if I just continue somebody's gonna pull me out again what a what a God we serve what a great God we serve amen so that's why we have a determination about us because we have a word that has ignited our faith we have events through scripture that we have watched and we have witnessed amen that God's not it's not just a book of history or a book of the past or you know Moses is not just somebody in the history and somebody in the past but that same God is still doing things today as he did Moses Joshua Caleb all those down through there and we watch God moving a very wonderful way he would allow them to get down to a red sea and then he would snatch them out come on now amen then we would watch as they would go through a desert he let him get to a bitter Waters then he would snatch him out of that situation he would let him get down to no water no food he'd snatch him out he let him get to the Jordan River where there was no way to cross and he would make a way of Escape snatch them out amen us and we have if we have truly placed our faith in that word then we know the same God that moved on their behalf it's also the same God that'll move on our behalf he's the same one that is pulling us out of our situation and out of our struggles and out of our torment out of our mind battles out of our Pro come on somebody amen out of our sicknesses out of cancer out of every kind of unclean Spirit it is God that is snatching us out and the devil thinks he's got you surrounded and he thinks you got your last moment I have I ain't got my last moment I got my moment to go through my door of Escape and listen this Rapture is going to come down to that it's like a trap it's a snatching away it comes as a thief in the night well we've heard it before I don't believe a thief comes up to your picture window grabs a rock and chunks it through in the middle of the night said hey I'm a thief I'm coming to take what's yours no no he comes and gone you don't even know it it's what his ambition is anyway to come and get what he wants and leave and you don't even know it to sometimes months later or weeks later or a year later you go check a drawer and hey that money you put there is gone or this is gone you realize hey I've been robbed this is what he's going to do with the rapture that's why he's allowed the waters to get so rough come on now he's allow things to go the what we would think impossible and what we would think unconseen conceivable and halfway he was in control we wouldn't do it this way but God is in control and God knows the end from the beginning therefore he allows things to get to where they're at and the conditions to be where they're at you know what your job is to do keep swimming keep pushing keep pressing keep going forward because God is going to make a wave Escape God's going to snatch his bride off the face of the earth and the world won't know nothing about it so it has to put a perseverance in US to have that you've got to have faith of in what you're trying to achieve you've got to have faith amen before you can be perseverance so faith and perseverance Works hand in hand together they're Brothers You Must Believe or you won't have no confidence amen if you lose confidence in a preacher you're not going to hear what he says I don't care who you are if you lose confidence in each other you're not going to want to know what they say you won't you know and then when you're looking to talk about the word now if you have no confidence you don't know you won't know whether you're right or whether you're wrong this is why we see these people that's that's lost their confidence in a profit and now lost their confidence in the Bible they don't know whether what's right and what's wrong they've lost it they're bearings they they're they're double-minded because believe me it ain't left them the Bible says train up a child in the way they're going it'll never leave them it ain't left them there's moments in their life as this Maniac could gather would come to himself and say Lord I need help and that cry would bring the master across the sea amen what was it he was something on him that how he was raised what he went through he knew that there was had to be a Deliverance for him and knew there had to be something that God could move so listen those out there in the world those that have walked away those that are saying whether they want to they may have blasphemed God they may not be no hope for them but it ain't left them amen that's what's causing the torment that's over their life amen because why it places something but when they lose their confidence then they don't know what's right or what's wrong when you have but when you have reached a place that you have faith in what you're doing then you can be perseverant so that's why Satan is always trying to break the confidence of the ministry come on now that's exactly what he's trying to do whether it be the prophet whether it be the father listen when brother Brandon was here what did he have to constantly hammer on God still uses Prophets that was a lot of a lot of times you'd hear him don't you believe God still uses prophets don't you God's not still uses it he does nothing until he reveal it to a service of prophets and then we get to our day what do we got to do God still uses 5-4 Ministry Satan is always trying to and to deter or to break down the confidence that God wants you to have as we heard brother Aaron the other night speak on the uh the church age book and the Nicolaitans spirit and he talked about Ministries that's built on negativity you know and as he was he went down he's not even just talking about preachers he's talking about individuals that your whole concept the whole thing is about negativity everything's negative and he talked go listen to us a wonderful it's in the church age book and he and he says you know he says you know what way he says if it calls you're you're you you think you're right and other people agree you're right don't mean you're right Satan deceived two-thirds or third of the Angels amen preaching the preaching and thinking he was right listen that's why we have to bring our confidence back to what the word says it ain't what I say or what anybody else says if the preacher is not preaching the word then they don't have you don't have to have confidence in it but if he's speaking what the word says then if you don't have confidence you ain't just lost confidence in the ministry you've lost it in the word of God and this is where Satan is trying to to deteriorate and to pull that and to make it to where hey that's just brother Timothy that's just brother Tim that's their own ideas that's just brother Branham he had all kind of ideas they're old they're old fogy ideas anyhow who wants to believe that anymore I am God and I change not God's word does not change with the decree the the the degree of sin you get what I'm saying just because sin is worse does not mean God just moves over a little bit and says you know what well it used to be wrong to do this but now it's not you see what I'm saying no God stays there he wants somewhere you can put your confidence on he said I was thinking about the history of our nation and a handful of soldiers on a cold winter day and odds all against them American soldiers he said when I read it it made me want to cry in my in my heart but their leader was a Christian George Washington the Delaware was froze over ice gorgeous in it and I understand about half the American soldiers didn't even have so shoes on their feet stuff just stuff wrapped around their feet them old they were the American soldiers obstacles was great the odds was against them but yet after prayer all night until he's wet up to his hips and snow where he knelt and prayed their great leader became perseverance for he had assurance that God was with him and he crossed to Delaware anywhere he was persevering although bullet holes went through his clothes he heard from God and no matter what the odds was he was going to continue the course amen he was persevering he had heard from God and he believed what God Said therefore it didn't matter if the river the river was frozen or the ice was breaking would break the boats it didn't matter what the obstacles was it mattered I'm going to stay the course because I have heard from God and God is with me come on bride of Jesus Christ we're not here to try to take another Nation we're not here to try to try to establish a nation that's not why we're here but we have heard from God and it doesn't matter how icy the river is or how danger it is or how bad it is amen God we've heard from God in this message and he said I am with you and I'll never leave you or forsake you Noah had to have that same perseverance I went and I told this before but I went and visited that boat and Noah built that one that replicated if it's anywhere close to what they built I'm glad I wasn't chosen to be Noah it took a special man for that I mean 120 years nailing nails and cutting logs and says hey what happened he had heard from God said no I found Grace in the eyes of the Lord Hallelujah in the middle of all that wickedness in the middle of all that nonsense around there Noah found Grace in the eyes of God and he was given a vision and he was told how to build it what to do you know all the rooms of it how many levels how length I mean detailed because God knew what it was going to take to get across the flood he knew that there was no other boat was going to be able to stand to stand the storms that were coming come on now I don't know is a type of the tribulation Saints the ending said also but these are also doing beings and dual purposes because brother Branham used it as the ark being the Ark of Safety and the Ark of the Covenant bringing it on down listen God knows exactly what it's going to take to go through every storm God knows exactly how to build this ship of Zion he knows exactly she goes how whatever wave is going to come and how bad it's going to be and how hard it's going to be and how difficult it's going to be he knows all about it he did not get the 2023 without a plan [Applause] but he has not got the 2022 or 23 and changing his plan God had a plan at the beginning and he's about first class was always the good plan it was the Gospel of Jesus Christ it was a gospel of Salvation it was the Gospel of the Holy Ghost it was the Gospel amen putting everything back in his order and God knows exactly where the nail ever bored Hallelujah he put the godhead back in this place and he put this one back in his place what was he doing building a ship because there was a little ship aside because there were some Believers that was going to step on that ship one morning between six and nine and take their body chains and leave this place he knows exactly how to build a ship it made it through one flood it'll make it through another but you had to have a determination took a lot of determination a lot of nails a lot of boards a lot of work a lot of Heartache a lot of critics a lot of men saying he's mad and lost his mind a lot of them walking away maybe there's a few others that would help him at the beginning well there and again preaches a wonderful sermon on that you can go back and listen to it on I think on the fence sitting on the fence about Noah well where's the rain coming from I don't know where the rain coming from I just know God said it's going to rain how's this all going to work out in this end time we're living in brother too I don't know how it's all going to work out I just know what it is because God said so amen I I just know judgment's coming and I know before judgment there is an Enoch that's going to leave here because ain't it was persistence amen the Bible says and it was a certain age and he walked with God now there was a certain time in his life that he didn't walk with God or he he didn't have the persistence or he didn't have the love I don't whatever you want to play but then as a certain part of his life the scripture breaks into it and says from here on he walked with God so this morning if you find yourself on the other side of the fence on this situation listen God can change it God can change it very quickly amen and he walked with God and it became very persistent and it became a very loyal and it became very uh I just all the time walking with God and communing with God until one day the scripture said God took him snatched him out reach down in that old stormy water and reached out and said this one I'm going to take why did he do that why did he take note in Enoch why did he put that in scripture why did he show Enid walk with God and was not the seventh from Adam why because the seventh from the second Adam was going to have to have a place they could put their foot on a faith to believe and to keep on swimming a faith of believing when all things are going against them I can look back and said he did it one time and he's going to do it again because his word said he would and he put a faith to keep on no matter what the difficulties no matter what the struggle no matter what the Temptation no matter who walks away who says this or says that I'm walking with God and God took him he said he's exactly he said let me go back he says right after Noah had called the voice of God the great thing God's program he says there's a great thing that so many is missing seeing is God's program there's nothing running out of line hear that there's nothing running out of line it's exactly right exactly on time he is never behind Hallelujah the coming of the Lord will be just perfect the church will be just exactly in order when he comes he's just exactly on time all are stewing worrying will do nothing just be persevere with the word of God and move on God Is Right on Time be perfect every time like all things the Sun and the Moon everything that God's created has worked on time for thousands of years no after he heard this though he not being a scholar perhaps laughed at as the Bible said they were mockers full of them he knew all the lay ahead of him in a great scientific world he was sure that nobody was going to believe him but for 120 years he was perseverant and he laid one timber on another Timber One Nail and another nail one piece and another piece people laughing making fun all the while but it didn't stop him why he had faith in what he had heard hello Noah's he had faith in what he had heard and Noah was very persevering with his message and he was Fearless no matter what any of them said they might have called him anything that didn't stop him he had Faith to believe God's word and went right on building a heart no matter how scientific they could prove his message was wrong man does he not does he not sound like he's preaching today Mercy we've got all kind of scientific things well so did they did in Noah's day but where are them scientific things today there's a lot of scientific things and intellectual thoughts you can put together and try to prove this and this this and that and the other and this would be wrong that'd be wrong all this you know I I actually have a little bit more grace for those in Noah's day that could prove things scientific because they was actually there they could actually take the instruments and shoot them up or do whatever improve it ain't never rained before why you think it's going to rain now brother Brian talked about him being a very Advanced age even many times Advanced beyond what we are I have more grace in my mind for them than some of these today that want to take these scientific things and try to prove this message wrong and they wasn't even there come on now he said no matter how many tried to prove him wrong he kept going anyhow that's the way with a True Believer no matter how much they say this is not the holy spirit it's psychology some kind of Illusion it's telepathy whatever it is that don't stop God's people a bit they know God made the promise that in this day it would be here so they persevered and press on with the message Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man perseverant so many through the scriptures Moses had to be persevering but what caused his persistence he tried on his own it killed one Egyptian he feared for his life ran and he forgot all about it so it wasn't his own intellectual ability that gave him perseverance it wasn't his own theology that gave him perseverance it isn't what he thought about it gave him perseverance what gave him perseverance is a burning bush he met God for himself the god that his mama talked about and his daddy talked about and told him how angels of God had kept him on the river now and brought him to Pharaoh's house and raised him up in his house to know the ins and outs of how Pharaoh were that God was planning him to be a deliverer but no matter how much his mom and daddy told him it couldn't give him perseverance they could try to instill it in them all they wanted to he couldn't do it the only thing that could give him the perseverance he needed was me God for himself and that's the only thing that'll give you perseverance is when you had your moment with that Pillar of Fire and here he goes up and he finds himself on the backside of a desert and he finds himself thinking it's got to be somebody else it's got to be somebody else's do this and the Bible says the voice spoke and said Is You perseverance stepped into the place of his excuses did you hear that it's perseverance stepped into the place of his excuses nothing was going to stop it then Anything could happen but it'll never take you you can be persevering because you can't die you're already dead we have the earnest of our Salvation right now because we're risen with him raised with him setting Heavenly places right now with his assurance amen you go down to Joshua and Caleb what gave them perseverance because they saw the god that Moses talked about become reality and open up the way through the Wilderness and through the Red Sea that when they got to their inheritance they said hey we're more than able what do you mean we can't take it God's already showed us he's with us three sodas he'll snatch us out when we're about to go down so why would we doubt him now him now and that gave them Faith to stand on because of their experience in the word of God you know David had to have perseverance he had to have a place he could stand on you know what gave him perseverance he had some experience for one out on the backside of a desert with a line and with a bear he'd been practicing what he believed and he saw what he believed worked and not only that he'd been called in by the prophet and he had the anointing oil poured over his head El Albright of Jesus Christ been called in by the message of the prophet and the anointing of the Holy Ghost poured over their head and it gave him a Persistence of perseverance to believe that when he went out there and he heard that Giant's cry he said this man will be just as dead as that bear or that lion listen David didn't go down amen into the battle because he fought well he went down into the battle because he believed well he believed that God was able to snatch him out because God had put the oil over his head and God had anointed him for this moment come on little Davis who's here this morning that has also had those experiences I saw God heal this and I saw God do this and this God that did that is the same God today and he's able to take this Goliath's head off I'm not going to fight him cause I fight well I'm gonna fight him because I believe well I believe in the one who said it could happen and I'm going to stand upon his word he was the smallest out of all his family actually the least thought of because when when the prophet came his daddy called everybody else let's read the scripture he called everybody else and this one came by nope nope nope nope nope nope however many sons down finally there ain't no more sun staying in line Samuel stopped and he says do you have any more yeah yeah I got another well where is he he said he's back there attending to the Sheep he said go get him he said we're not going to sit down and eat till he comes amen this Prophet had a belief in what God had told him he didn't send him down to down to Jesse's house for nothing he sent him down to Jesse's house to anoint someone and the spirit of God would come by every time nope nope nope and when he ran out he knew there had to be another so he was persistent he's like hey you got another son yeah I got one we'll call it we're not going to sit down and win this little sheep heard her taken from the Sheep coat which means out of nothing a nobody God said this is a man after my own heart because he saw something on the inside of him David wasn't going to be unstable David was going to fight and be persistent and he anointed him and he went and killed a giant and killed many others for the glory of God he said if you can find the place in the plan of God if you can find that spot that word even though you may be sick and nearly dead you say well I'm a Christian how could that be in the plan of God it might be in God's plan to heal you and give you a testimony that will shake souls to the kingdom of God certainly he lets those things happen maybe you've had your ups and downs the enemy scorching you from every side it might have been that way that is all in God's plan might not be in your plan but it's in God's plan might not be how we would have planned it but that's the way God planned it because Allah promise you my plans would be a lot different but God has the ultimate saying just like in Joe's life when he was afflicted soars all over him that was all in the plan of God but job had to come to a point of being persevering because he knew he had kept God's word and he had offered the sacrifice and there was a sacrifice over his life therefore he knew God was not judging him because of his sin because he had offered a lamb so when the comforters would come and boy you go I listen to him here a while back and they go over here they pick his life apart and they look at this part and they look at this part and they look at this part and look at this part and job's like no I didn't do none of that no this is not true no I did not sin no there isn't sin in my life I have done things right I have offered desire and Joe's answer and answering all these comforters but then there's one comes he don't tell him he don't even really talk to him so much about his current situation he takes him back before he said job where were you before the Morning Star shouted for then the sons of God shouted where were you and then he takes him from where he was to where he was going to be and he lifted him up off that ass sheep to where he could look past 6 000 years or thousands of years and he could see the resurrected Jesus Christ and he said although the skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh I will see God he knew I was there and I'm going to be there so what's happening here is not relevant to these that's that's what you got to get your mind to What's Happening Here is not relevant to these as far as your salvation you know you go through things in life you think well God doesn't love me now that don't change here here no no and they don't he still loves you you're just going through something but don't worry he's gonna make a way of Escape foreign Hallelujah got to be persistent got to push through the hard times and there's plenty of them you know Samson had to had to do that he had to be persistent and God would use him he would talk about it he said when he come down and grabbed to hold one of them skulls and killed a thousand Philistines single-handed didn't scare he didn't scare him he felt them Seven Locks they were hanging there and it gave him a perseverance to fight through anything it wasn't until that Covenant was cut off that he lost his ability to do what he is doing because he had given his secret he said as long as a Christian can know I'm living above sin there's a lamb that's been offered for My Sacrifice I'm perfect because the Lamb's perfect the holy spirit is blessing me and I'm standing with him I'm going to be persevered and pressed toward the mark of the High Calling amen Christians should every Christian should be that way very persistent in their way with God determined to fulfill he said well what if so and so says something this well you know there was a Greek woman she had a lot of difficulties a lot of problems to press through a lot of issues a lot of critics a lot of ones that told her you do you go brother go go listen to the servant go do this we're going to cut you off there was something in her heart I have a need I got a need from God and she wasn't out of the word of God she wasn't out of the will of God it was the will of God to heal but God was testing her faith and she pushes through all her disappointments and all of her struggles and she walks up and says Lord called him but what the Jews should have called him and he looks at her he said Lord I have this need my daughter he looked at her and you know he didn't give her a pat on the back didn't say you're doing a good job he said I wasn't even sent to your race in other words he called her a dog I wasn't even sent to you and he turns back around and brother Brandon said something rose up on that little faith rose up to a place and said yay Lord but even the dogs get the crumbs from the master's table he said her persistence and her attitude turned him back around and said you can have what you have what you say because I have not found Faith like this in Israel why because he was she was willing no matter what it took didn't matter what somebody's going to say what somebody's going to do what was going to go on it didn't matter I'm doing this for one reason it's for him and I'm doing it according to his word now you can do be doing things for him and be out of his word go listen to the tape doing God a service without his will his will is his word amen but when you're in his will and you're in his word you can be persistent and it doesn't matter what people say it doesn't matter what goes on in the church it doesn't matter what somebody says from the pulpit it matters not all that matters is him she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any hindrance you might have many hindrance I have plenty of them lots of hindrance but what about your faith if you can't be persistent if you're going to let everything hinder you now physically you might feel bad physically you may not feel well otherwise you may not feel like going to church you may not feel like doing anything but your faith doesn't have no hindrances it'll move you anyhow maybe your pastor prayed for you anointed you with all that's what he's supposed to do and you go back and say Pastor I don't feel no better oh my you're ought not come up in the first place you're going by your feelings but start going by your faith God's gonna answer me God's going to meet me God's going to touch me [Music] he said your faith in the word of God call the Elders of the Elders of the church let them anoint you with oil and pray over you and the prayer of faith shall save the sick if you got faith in God faith and prayer then go on anyhow but nothing's going to stop it you've got faith you believe it Faith doesn't have any hindrance but this woman had plenty of hindrance you have plenty of hindrances physical and spiritual but if your faith believes in God there's no hindrance in your faith doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter what you believe if you believe God's word and have faith there then you have something you can stand on Mercy we're going down she admitted what he said was the truth I'm not worthy Lord I'm but I'm here for the crumbs it's true children eat your right Lord your word is true every one of them I'm not worthy sit at the table with the children but Lord let me call something to your attention the dogs are willing to eat the crumbs and if I can just get a crumb because she knew why did she ask for a crime because she knew everything that was in the loaf of bread was in that crumb man God may not give you the whole loaf he may not at all at once just put the whole loaf in your hand he may just give you a crumb here and a crumb there and a crumb here but if you're just willing to take the crumbs God's able to fulfill what you have need of in your body what you have need of in your spirit what you have need of in your heart what you have need of and around you God is able because everything that was in the loaf is in the crumb we ought to be Chrome Seekers because God has promises he's the bread of life he's the bread that came down of Heaven if all I can get when I come is a crumb I want what God has for me this is what he would say and being persistent he says you can have 25 cents the purchase and power of a loaf of bread we need about five dollars and 25 cents a day he said but you can be as happy with that because you know it will buy what you have need of and he said we have the blood of Jesus Christ it has purchased everything that we have need of from here to Glory so we can be persistent and we can hold on and we can stand there when all hell is against us and it will be amen we can have courage in the middle of the devil's howling the devil wants to howl and he wants to howl and he wants to howl and say I'm going to tear this down and I'm going to tear this church up and I'm going to do this and I'm going to do this there ain't going to be no bride let him how you know when he's howling you know why he's howling because he's about to be exposed amen when he begins to scream out and it begins to curse and it begins to he knows you're right at the moment of your victory and he's trying everything he can do to keep you from grabbing a hold of the whole loaf wherefore let him that thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall there has no temptation taking you but such is common to man but God is

put in your lingo I will not fear what any devil is going to do to me Satan may rise up against me many there be that trouble me many there be that say there's no help from God but thou O Lord or a shield I was reading this today Genesis 28 and verse 11. talking about Jacob you ever heard of Jacob's pillow with stone it's more than just a good story you know that stone if you'll begin to study it it's the same rock that followed the children of Israel Hallelujah I'll show you he lighted upon a sergeant I'm giving you Faith to stand to keep swimming he lighted upon a certain place and teared there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillow and laid down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set on the earth top of it reached to the heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending you know we I've seen a lot of drawings or some drawings of this pewter beautiful paintings you ever seen him how many ever seen a painting of this jacob laying at the ladder Angels but that's more than just a painting what were their Angels what was the Angels doing it was going in delivering messages snatching people out of situations going back up if you'll get past it being more than just a story more than just a painting brother Adam said where was that ladder tied to he said that ladder was tied on one end to the throne of God and the other end to the Rock Jesus Christ he said why did he do it that way so those promises that he was sending up and down off that ladder they wouldn't slip oh Hallelujah but they was going to be constant and they was going to be there for you in your darkest trial an angel was going to come down and give you a piece of bread an angel is going to come down and give you a promise of God and God was going to minister to you in your time of struggle hallelujah amen this is more than just a beautiful picture this is thus saith the Lord God's will for you that you have a place that you can rest upon oh it might be hard it might be all kind of things all hell might be against you but you can rest in the middle of the storm why because you're sleeping and resting on the Rock of Ages Hallelujah because listen to this he comes down in verse 13. and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father he wanted to Jacob know who he was thy father and the god of Isaac and the land were on thy lies to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth what was it this is the same promise he told Abraham it was the same promise it was now being moved over to Jacob he said Jacob I'm going to give you a reason to keep swimming keep moving because I seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the West the East and North the South and in thee in that seed shall all families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee he didn't say I'm with I was with Abraham he said I am with thee and will keep thee and all the places whether thou goest and will bring thee again to this land for I will not leave thee until I've done that which I've spoken of thee and Jacob woken up out of sleep and said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not God maybe that'll be yours your thoughts today maybe you've been a been a kind of in a disarrayed delusion but today you can be woken up and realize hey God is in this place God is God is Among Us entering these God is touching Hearts God is ministering God is dealing with the needs of his people and angels are ascending and descending and moving back and forth amen because it's a ladder that's still existing today it's still there today listen he says look look at Jesus to identify himself with a stone that would never let the promises slip this stone that would anchor forever can somebody say forever anchor forever and forever God's coveted and promised people he said does thou believe what I've told you these things Thou shalt see greater things in this you shall see the heavens open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of God up and down Jacob's Ladder because he's God's anchor as long as I'm in Christ Jesus I'm Anchored In God the Angels ascending and descending going up first and coming down what are they doing they're taking messages up and bringing messages down taking messages up taking messages down he was that anchoring place for Jacob's Ladder Jesus was where the promised seed would come from he was God's Eternal promise see he was that sure Stone he was that perfect Foundation that God's truth can anchor in and all devils in hell and everything else will never move it God has anchored it forever in him so you can take the word of God and just keep swimming because God's going to move somehow I don't know how I don't know how God's going to do it I just know he's going to do it how do you know he's going to because he said he was therefore it gives me the strength to just keep swimming brother Brown tells us a story being up in Colorado so standing on a mountain is watching old mother Eagle as she brought her little ones from The Nest on her wings and set them down in a grassy pasture people won't say ah don't happen Eagles don't do that well the Bible said they do he said as an eagle beareth her Young on his wing her wings so however you want to look at it you got scientific proof it don't happen that's up to you I just know what the Bible said and I got confidence in this prophet and he said he watched them as they come down and she flew back up to the very highest peak on a rock she could go and she began to watch and as I was watching through my binoculars my horse hissed to a tree and I was just watching he said my you told me you ever been around the Eagle's Nest he said they make all the sharp sticks and things and more poor little Eagles Walk around those thick sticks and Thorns they never knew anything else but one day the mother spread her forth her wings and she stepped out on the wings and went down they stepped out on wings went down I looked at those little fellas they was having themselves a Pentecostal Revival down in that little field they were running down that soft grass picking here chirping there jumping around I thought well that's right now that's just like a man in an old mess of the world knows nothing but what the devil can give him but one day God picks him up sets him down on some shady Green Pastures and how he rejoices and he's free there's nothing no harm I thought why why ain't those little fellas afraid wonder if they realize there's coyotes around here try to pick them up but all at once in a while they would just look up and they would see the old mother Eagles sitting up there I thought well praise be to God he's taking me out of the nests of the world and he's climbed to the ramparts of glory and he's sitting High watching over his Heritage and if a coyote would ever start towards one of us Little Eagles she would flog him to death come on somebody he said that's right let Satan take after a Believer he's got Jesus Christ on his hands Hallelujah the devil ain't just dealing with you he's dealing with God she was watching with her great Majestic head looking around she was on the highest Rock because she could see her so she could see after a while seeing her raise her head up and I'd look through my 10 power binoculars I said what is it way back over in the north a northern the storm is coming thunder began to Roar and lightning began to fly and she let out a scream and down through there she went with those big old Wings right on that grassy parrot Prairie every one of them little Eagles ran over real quick they were instructed perhaps before leaving the nest and they caught their little feet right in the feathers throwed that little mouth down hooked their little Bill across the feather she raised up with a bunch of eaglets and on his wings and went just straight through that wind as hard as she could go right back to the cleft of The Rock he said I sat there and cried like a baby I thought some glorious day when this Revival's over he's going to come from glory and he's going to spread forth those wings of power and Us Little Eagles are going to hook our beaks in there and fly to Glory with him Hallelujah God is determined to fulfill his word therefore we must also be determined to fulfill God is going to take care of you some of you just need to say that God's going to take care of me he's going to Watch Over Me he's going to see when that old coyote slick-headed fella is going to show up he's going to see it and he's going to be there for you he's going to watch When Storms gather he knows when they're coming he knows they're coming before you even do so how you feel like you're going to be able to prepare when you don't even know it's coming but all God already has a preparation flee to him
