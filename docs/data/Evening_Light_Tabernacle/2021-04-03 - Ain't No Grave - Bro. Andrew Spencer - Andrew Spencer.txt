eagles are birthed when there is a breaking of an atmosphere amen we're so privileged to be standing here in this hour standing with you in this meeting and it's it's such an honor and we appreciate brother tim and the church for inviting us to be here to be standing with shoulder to shoulder with these generals i feel like the the littlest of all of them and i'm just i'm definitely littler than brother aaron and but i i'm really i'm really honored to be standing here i spoke with brother danny just a few moments ago how's it feel to be preaching in a meeting with a man that's supposed to be dead if that don't raise your faith to another level all things are possible to them that believe i believe that this meeting will change every outlook on your life and if all we can do is just point you to a faith of just one man in this building it's been this year has been a powerful year for full gospel lighthouse and the spencer family we've seen jesus real close we've seen the god that 2000 years ago on this day it looked like all hope was gone but i want to tell you he's alive he's alive look at your neighbor elbow maybe a little bit [Music] he's alive he's alive amen god bless you this morning let's have church amen i don't know i don't know much a whole lot about everything else out in the world this is about the only thing i i know how to do is have church you know i was asked a while back what do i do for a profession i told him i studied drunk people it's a profession and last night i watched some drunk people on the holy ghost amen if you have your bibles this morning we'd like to look over in the book of ezekiel chapter 37. ezekiel chapter 37 verse 1. i tell you that brother danny he's dangerous ain't he what an awesome awesome awesome service last night we just want to step out of the way here just for a few moments and let the lord have his way today i believe we're in for a powerful day ezekiel chapter 37 and verse 1 and before we read it let's speak to the author of the word this morning heaven in here has a need this morning that you'd like to lift before the lord amen god sees each and every one of your hands let's not leave here disappointed this this morning let's leave here in full assurance that he's the god that keeps the promises heavenly father we come before your throne of mercy and grace today we so appreciate lord the power lord of your anointing that we feel here at this pulpit lord but i don't believe it's just here father i believe it's all over this building and lord we've gathered one more time lord we've quieted our spirits lord we've we've studied out your your word lord and we've just tried to find the mind of god and father we pray today that you would go across this congregation father here and on the internet we pray that you would begin to bless your people all over this land and i pray father that you would move in a very special way lord i pray that you'd move us aside and set us down in a corner as it were father and lord just speak through the vessel lord i pray that you would reach out and touch those hands that were lifted up lord they didn't lift their hands to a man actually they defied gravity to begin to lift up a hand and need that that you would come by their way and father that's what we're desiring here is just one more time that you would come by our way lord bless bless us as we read your word this morning in the name of jesus christ amen ezekiel chapter 37 and verse 1 and the bible said that the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord god thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god under these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and i will lay sinews upon you and i will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when i beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say unto the wind to thus save the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon thee slain that they might live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet and exceeding great army then he said unto me son of man can these bones these bones are the whole house of israel behold they they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off from our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel and you shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves on my people and brought you up out of your graves and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and i shall place you in your own land then you shall know that i the lord have spoken it and performed it saith the lord amen god bless you this morning we'll let you have your seats i'd like to take a just a for a few moments from this thought i've spoke from this chapter many times but i'd like to take from this thought this morning there ain't no grave going to hold this body down there ain't no grave gonna hold this body down and i love what ezekiel taps into here he reaches in and he sees something and i love it when god does something and you know that it's him when god does something and it's not a man because god will get the glory out of all things because when god does something you will see the materialization of the power of the spoken word of god when he said prophesy then you begin to watch the materialization of those promises as they're coming to pass but you begin to look in through the bible and you begin to look in genesis and you're looking all the way through all the way up to christ and you can see that that through the fall of humanity that death was the very first thing that god would speak to man that if he would do this certain deed if he would partake of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that he would surely die and so we realized that death was one of the first things that was spoken of when god begins to speak to man and man had always feared death because man didn't know what was on the other side of it they had no ever they had no assurance of ever coming back and even job when he was standing there and he was as we understand that he was one of the fir it was one of the first bible books of the bible but job himself and all of the torimo of life that he was going through when when satan touched his life and satan cursed everything that he was and he come to the spot in life and he looked out upon nature and he's seen the trees budding he's seen the flowers that they would pass away in the winter time and he would watch in springtime how that they would come back but he asked this question i don't believe it's a great question if a man dies shall he live again and he said all these days of my life i will wait i will wait till my change come you see man was looking for an escape of the grave so it tells us that as soon as we begin to look we begin to look at humanity that they're looking at a way out you see man was built to live forever but because of the fall in the garden of eden there was a curse that was put on man but there was a god that was bigger than a curse there was a god that would come by the way of a redeemer and make of a way of escape for you and i and the humanity was looking for that escape every prophet would testify that i'm looking for this escape they're looking for that redeemer they're looking for that one that is able to roll away the reproach are you with me you see all the prophets testify that we needed a redeemer even even you look over at dave and you begin to find that david would tap into a channel of a believer and he would begin to look in there and he'd begin to call out things about the grave and call out things about death i as a as a young minister as a young pastor i have stood i have stood at the at the feet at the feet of caskets i have stood at a pulpit and i've had to preach funerals for little bitty babies i've had to preach funerals for for old generals but i can tell you the greatest assurance that i have when i stand behind somebody that is going on to be with the lord is when i can direct the people or the family that is surrounding them that there is a hope beyond this life what an amazing thing for for young people to look at you're not going to live forever in this in this humanity but to know where you're going but be as a minister to stand there and tell them you don't have to worry this is not the end this is just the beginning when they took their last breath here it was their first breath there you see death is not a respecter of persons death don't care how old you are death don't care how smart you are death don't care how rich you are death don't care how poor you are it's not a respecter of persons but death will come to you and there's only thing there's only one thing that's standing between you and death and it's a heartbeat as my granddaddy homer fraser would say that's a mighty small thing that's standing between you and god but you realize that david was tapping into a channel when he started looking at the grave and he contemplated what the grave was and the power of the grave and david grabbed over in psalms 49 that god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave even though you go by the way of the grave there's a god that knows how to get you back into a body that doesn't wear it doesn't wear out but he can pick you up and take you out of the grave i don't believe that's just talking about the natural grave but any grave that you're in young people you can get out of that grave because there is a redeemer that has the power over hell death and the grave when he rose up on easter morning he rose up he was not keyless he was not clueless he had the keys of death hell and the grave there ain't no grave going to hold this body down oh hallelujah hallelujah the bible said in hebrews 2 that that we see jesus there's a lot of people that don't know jesus but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man you see all of those prophecies that the prophets had foretold us were hooked in this one man jesus job asks the question if a man dies shall he live again he pondered these things shall i live again i can see all of these things i can see what i'm going through but can i live again and brother branham caught it as he as job went into that realm of a believer and he broke down something that gives every person every person a hope that job when the lightnings begin to flash and the thunders begin to roll he grabbed a revelation for every prophet all the way to abraham isaac and jacob he would say i know that my redeemer lives yet in my flesh i will see god you see easter proved easter proved that man that had been shut up in a prison house young people they get the idea that they're superman and they can live forever but this flesh is fleeting and it's failing and man was put in a prison house and this air is an escape death is an escape for a real believer let me just let me just stop right here for a moment for a real believer death can be a friend death can get you out of this old pest house but i don't want to just talk to a people about death today i don't believe that you were ordained to die i believe with all of my heart that i am preaching to a people that will not go by the way of the grave i want to say to the body of the living god there will not be one grace there won't be one grave you can name it you can call it what you want to there won't be one grave of trinitarianism that'll hold us down there won't be no evie easy believers that'll hold us down there won't be no false doctrine that'll hold us down there ain't no grave gonna hold this body down let me give you something else to shout about he's not the god of the dead he's the god of the living abraham when abraham when he when he watched when death would begin to come by his way when he took his sweetheart away from him and abraham is looking for a piece of ground that he could bury his sweetheart in he goes to the sons of heth and he goes to them and he says i want to purchase this piece of property i want to buy this cave off of you mcpahilla and i want to purchase it off of you and they said no we'll we'll give it to you for free you don't even have to buy it from us but abraham understood he was wanting to give them a witness you see they were just wanting to give it to him but he wanted a possession he wanted a possession that he could call his own that this is where i have buried my sweetheart out you see they did the same thing satan did the same thing with jesus he tried to offer him a kingdom without a calvary and satan will try to offer you religion without a baptism of the holy ghost you remember when satan offers you the easy way out it ain't the easy way it's hale's way [Applause] but he said i want to purchase this piece of property for as much money as it is worth i'm willing to pay whatever it costs and it goes down in history as the most expensive piece of property that was ever told do you realize that on the cross 2000 years ago that you were the greatest you were the most expensive you were the people that god was willing to pay whatever it costs whatever it costs when he stood there with that revelation that i'm going to buy this piece of property you see he got a hold of job's revelation he said if job is going to be buried there and job said i know that my redeemer liveth that in my flesh yet i see god he said i want to be buried wherever where job is buried at bury me close because job's got a revelation that he's going to see the redeemer [Music] all of them prophets they were looking at it he said i'm buying this piece of property for my son isaac for myself for jacob and for joseph you see they caught a revelation that there was one coming that had the ability to raise them up out of the grave [Applause] and jacob and joseph when they were there in egypt he made him lay his hands on him lay your hands right here where the angel touched me and i started walking differently you lay your hands right here and you make me an oath that you'll not bury my bones down here in egypt we see because those prophets realize that there was no resurrection power down there in egypt there was no resurrection power down there in laodicea there was no resurrection power down there to methodists nor at the mennonite church or the amish church or the catholic church they said don't you bury me down there in that trinitary watery grave all they want to do is sprinkle a little dirt on you that ain't got no resurrection power but if you're gonna baptize me you baptize me where there's life at in the name of jesus christ how do you get in that body by one spirit we're baptized into that body you bury me down there where there ain't no life you make a covenant with me swear by me that you'll carry these bones out of here young people there's only one name that you can be buried in and have the faith to get up out of the grave his name is jesus pharaoh said no you're going to stay right here jacob said no i'm going out of here joseph made that covenant you lay your hands on this coffin tell me don't leave me down here and even though you might be walking past this coffin it's telling you that there is a promise there is a redeemer that is coming that has the ability to take this body out of the grave you may be stuck down here and lay on us here and you may feel like our hope is gone but andrew spencer came all the way from elkton virginia to tell you there ain't no graves don't you bury me down here and some easy believe ism don't you bury me down here in your watered-down gospel of the message of push and play there ain't no life in push and play but there is life in this game yesterday today and forever he's a living god he knows what you're going through you ain't got to give him your resume he don't need to know what you've been through and what you're going to go through he's always been there the reason i can stand here in passion and with power and testify to you i've seen that jesus i've witnessed that jesus i've handled that jesus [Applause] my dad said on the way down here satan hang on it's going to be a bad ride my mama there ain't no grave gonna hold my body down there ain't no gray gonna hold my body down for my man came death and by man came the resurrection of the dead for as adam all die even so in christ shall you be made alive you see satan wants to send you to a premature grave he's already caught your burial place picked out where he's going to lay you down maybe he's trying to pick out pornography maybe he's trying to pick out a grave sign of lust maybe he's trying to pick out a graveside of depression and he says you're going to be buried there but jesus come to tell you there ain't no grave gonna hold my body down you can try to bury him with doubt and fear and all kinds of things but only on sunday morning ah i watched my redeemer get up out of the grave and the same power that raised jesus christ from the grave is alive and well living in a young people and satan ain't got enough power to stop you hallelujah he'll try to bury you in drugs and alcohol formalism but the god of this message says shut up devil there's an empty tomb i will walk before the lord in the land of the living [Applause] you see satan is doing his very best to corrupt our young people he's trying his very best to bring them some dr dobson idea that you can break out these seven points and you will have overcoming power let me tell you i didn't have to go through seven steps i didn't have to go through dr dobson's idea to get over corruption i just had one encounter with elohim he changed my thinking he changed my walking but satan is trying his very best to corrupt our young people he's trying to corrupt the body he's trying to set in corruption in the government and you can see that they are obeying and kneeling to his power but there is a people on earth that will not bow to his corruption you can have faith this morning to know that jesus knew so emphatically who he was that he could go to hell on a backslidden preacher's word on a backslidden preacher's word but yet he was so inspired that jesus said that he trusted every single one of those words that the prophet had spoke i will not let my holy one see corruption you see he so trusted it that not one cell of his body would corrupt now notice what the prophet says here he said when the word was spoke and said i'll not sever my holy one to see corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell there wasn't enough time there wasn't enough devils there wasn't enough anything to keep christ in the grave do his body begin to rot because the law of god would bring the word to pass and the law of god by the holy spirit brings any promise to pass regardless of the conditions job said though these skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh i see god notice what the prophet says to you regardless of how little we are how low we are how impure we are how unholy we are how sick we are how afflicted we are the law of god's spirit by his word makes it obey and forces the issue and says give it back oh if we could just think of that for a moment it forces it regardless of conditions no matter what the condition is the law of god's word forces the condition to cope with his word it's got to so you can name your condition or you can name your grave but the word will make and force its way so that it will cope to the word of god you know cancer's been obeying a body i'm not talking about this flesh but i'm talking about your body that cancer has been obeying a body because a body has said cancer you can't have ron spencer cancer you can't have susan hershberg cancer you can't have erica parker you see jesus so knew who he was that he would say that i have power to lay my life down and i have power to take it up again and jesus had an unfailing faith in his position to know that he was the perfect born son of god [Music] and if your faith will put you in position to know that every divine promise of god's bible is for you you can walk out of that sin you can walk out of that depression you can walk out of that complex you can come out of that turtle shell that makes you sit there with your arm crossed said i'm not going to get emotional if you're god you're bound to get emotional you say what's going on down there and evening like tabernacle i hear a rattling i hear a shaking taking place get ready you just get ready but i'm not going to get emotional you wait till dry bones start taking on flesh you wait till they start taking on mushrooms they don't just grab the mechanics they grab the dynamics of the holy ghost and all of a sudden the wind comes across those dry bones he's tried his best to corrupt you but you are born again not of a corruptable seed but you are born again of the incorruptible seed of the genealogy of almighty god that he deposited before the foundation of the world and that seed has the power it has the capacity to handle what it's supposed to go through [Applause] you may go through some stuff how many's went through some stuff some stuff you know what that does it just makes a better ground to break out of [Applause] oh yeah you say there's no way i'm coming up out of all this dirt you don't understand all the things that i've built up in my life and all the darkness of sin that i've gone through let me tell you that's where beauty is made at you may not understand that but let me tell you that's where your beauty is breaking forth at he said well i just don't know i just don't know if i can really break through let me tell you i watched young people last night that stood here under a power of a demonic spirit that would try to hold them down but i watched the living god come and break chains over them the father is seeking those that will worship him in spirit and in truth now as children we all used to love playing hide and go seek but can you imagine almighty god seeking out he's hunting do you believe his brothers that god himself has got himself a rifle on his back and is hunting out people that will worship him with spirit and in truth well you say what is that rifle doing on his back it's there just in case the devil shows up to stop you from worshiping he'll shoot him with a double-barrel shotgun of the word you see god's looking for somebody god's looking for a body that he can live in a body that he can move in when you say my dad is a pastor my daddy's a preacher my granddad is a preacher i can just go in on the coattail of my daddy's experience i think brother danny did a wonderful job of saying you can't ride in on somebody else's hotel i'm not gonna move because i've heard all 1100 and some sermons of the prophet's ministry and it's not gonna move me you just stay there in your pity and your waller and all of your doubt while the rest of us go ahead and shout you can sit on me you can try to stop me from preaching but i know that the father is seeking those that will worship him in spirit and in truth you know that the prophet said that it's god's strategy to take him empty human vessels and shake the world with them shake the world with them so god is looking for dry bones that he could put his life in jesus said in matthew 5 and 25 the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live verse 28 marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice it's time to get out of it the voice of the living god is speaking it's time to get up out of that grief you see the head rose up on easter morning and the body has to follow what the head does so if we have the mind of christ we've got to think like the mind of christ we got to speak like the mighty christ we cannot wallor in our defeat you were not put here to be in defeat you were put here to be the victorious blameless spotless body of jesus christ as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so if you think yourself a winner you're going to be a winner and if you think yourself a loser you're gonna be a loser but you were not seen here in defeat the enemy that's his job to make you feel defeated and get so depressed so shook up you don't know if god loves you i'm not preaching hard to you to tell you this but i'm trying to tell you that i love you i love you but somebody bigger than me loves you you were not seen here in defeat you were not seen here overcome by the enemy it's completely opposite because job was asked the question where was your job when i when i framed the world and i made the foundation of the world where was you you was not seen there in defeat you were seen there shouting and when you are shouting that means you got the victory [Applause] the head is connected to the body so the body has got to come up you know i i as a young minister i've had i've had my fair share of funerals i guess it's cause i got thrown into it early but i've had i wouldn't say it's a pleasure but i've had the the opportunity to go buy a lot of caskets see a lot of brothers and sisters has done one that went on to be with the lord but you know something i absolutely despise brother day i absolutely hate it when you're standing there by a casket and they're just standing there and they're looking down oh don't they look good they just really caught their personality i told my wife if she if i die by the way the grave and you come and stand over top of my casket and you say oh don't he look good i am gonna come back and haunt you every day of your life oh don't they look good they cocked them in their personnel did i look that dead in life was i that bad then i did i looked like on the back of hank and my teeth were about to fall out but i'm afraid that too many preachers are so satisfied with looking at a dead body oh don't they look good don't they look i think they just picture christ that's what that's what god mentioned to be what kind of gospel are you preaching that when you look at a dead body say oh they look good i'm looking at a body that knows how to dance knows how to shout know what it's like to overcome temptation you look good you look good in your dance you look good in your south you look good in your victory ain't no grave gonna hold this body path well i look way over jordan i said what do you think i see i saw a group of young people they were coming with jesus if the head got up out of the bridge the body's got to get up out of the grave if there was no corruption that could hold him down there'll be no corruption that'll hold this fire [Applause] i'll go ahead and praise the lord hang on devil gonna be a bad ride now when ezekiel was standing there and you can imagine ezekiel is standing there in that valley full of dry bones as he's looking out and he's seeing this dry bones you know i had i had a brother bless his heart come to me and tell me he said you know i got the revelation and if you're listening brother i still love you bless your heart when he looked he said i got the revelation of that ezekiel 37. he said i got the revelation he said everybody's caught up on it being israel but i've got the revelation it's china they've got the greatest army in the world i thought my brother how do i answer this go read the rest of the chapter you know that was a pretty simple so i i solved that thing pretty quick you know ain't that amazing but i i said look and read the rest of the chapter but matter of fact take a look right here you're looking at the most powerful army that's on the face of the earth prophesy son of man can these bones live again you're not feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man you're feeding oh and you're not feeding on the mind of a manual feeling on the unfailing body word of the son of man that has the power to rake and wake you up wake up if you're in your sin if you're into your condition wake up the son of man is prophesied these bones will live again he said i'm not getting up i'm not getting up he said prophesy son of man can these bones live again the life didn't come when the skin was on there was four stages there's four stages of sin you skin and flesh but they never walked until the wind came and the wind started moving and he said son of man breathe oh breath of god breathe on them and the prophet said that the pentecostal church is born of the breath of god not of the devil would like to tell you that you're all right the way you are he'd like to tell you that you're okay in your dead cold formal church you can stand there in your muscles you can flex your muscles there's a little bitty boy here six years old it's got muscles and he likes flexing them but he's got more than just muscles he's got a living god there he's witness a living god but the enemy would like to tell you that you're okay living in your flesh you're okay living with the mechanics but if the breath of god isn't there the answer praise the inspiration of god if it isn't breathing on you you'll stay there in that dead cold formal church you won't ever move when the spirit moves but there is a word that will put this body back into shape there is a word that is inspired by the move of god that is that men of god are influenced and inspired by god and they are prophesying they are speaking again what the mighty angel has said you're not sitting here under the ministry of a weak angel you're standing here under the ministry of a mighty angel and when you see that son of man start speaking again in a body you watch that word go out and you watch it be manifested because the same wind is in that preacher is in that body and each generation has its own revival and its own chance at the word these young people have a chance this morning there's a lot of people in the message that don't want to give these young people a chance but we're giving you your chance this morning this message will tell you you got a chance you got your own revival you got a chance at it these young people deserve a chance it ain't just for the elders it ain't just for the old folk it ain't just for the middle-aged folk it's for the young people it's for the little kids it's your time you're gonna come through that opposition you're gonna come through that fear you're gonna come through them thanks satan is doing his absolute worst to shut the door and shut the grave and try to tell you to stand there but the spirit of the living god's telling you get up [Applause] get up out of your opposition get up by your pain get up out of your suffering you don't know what i've been through let me tell you hold thou suffering stand and be healed you have been given a god-given privilege to stand here with the capacity of the gene of god this god won't give up on you he won't back off of his promises if he said he'd give you the holy ghost he'll give you the holy ghost he's a god of firsts and second chances [Applause] my little daughters listened to this back home reagan nine years old when we was raised her up she was a little powerful real spiritual girl real powerful little lady real sensitive to the move of the holy spirit and we were we were teaching her on the power of prayer and we began to begin to talk to her and we teach her how to pray and we were telling her now you this is how you you start out your prayer this is how you do these things and we were telling her to thank god for the day go ahead and thank god for the day and go ahead and take him and take him and thank him for all the things that he's given to you and she was she was so young that she was she was going through this process and she said i ask you god for this beautiful day she was trying to say i thank you god for this beautiful day but every every single time she would pray at night time she said i ask you god for this beautiful day and so i was trying to tell her trying to teach her in the right way now honey i know what you're trying to say but you want to you want to say i know what you're trying to say you're trying to say god i thank you for this beautiful day and so one night she was praying and she started praying she said i ask you god for this beautiful day and she stopped in her prayer she said daddy can i start over again i about had a conniption fit i saw baby you can start over you can start over anytime you want to you can start over you may have fell in your sin you may have fell in your condition you can get up out of that grave the enemy set a trap for you get up out of that grave today's a day to start over you say i failed yesterday get back up he's a god of first chances god has taken chances god of third chances god of war trenches get up get up you say i don't know i don't know i seem to keep falling i keep falling back in the same condition falling back in the same sin keep falling in the trouble is you never got far enough in yet but if you get into this message you can get deep enough into this message the message just won't be just books and tapes it'll be a life i heard a little story the other day like this little boy little billy he would mama put him in bed at night time she'd take him up there she'd take him up there and put him in his bed and about midnight she heard little billy fall out of his bed billy fell out of his bed he just a whining and hollering mama run upstairs said billy okay billy occasion mama i feel like to be i felt like to be so she put him back in the bed well the next night she goes to sleep and all of a sudden plop is that how y'all fall down here louisiana could plump clip plop is that close okay he falls out of the bed again she runs billy what's going on oh i fell out of bed i'm out of bed again so she puts him back in the bed same thing happened another night she runs back up here she said billy why you keep falling out of bed she said mama could you fix this can you fix this so i don't fall out the bed again she said honey it's real simple if you'll get far enough in you won't fall out and if you get far enough into this message we didn't come here to talk about a message we've come to get in the message and if you can get in this message and get wrapped up tired of tangled up from jesus you won't fall out you'll fall in love with jesus and the enemy will try to tell you and lie on you and tell you that you're just getting emotional you're not just getting emotional it's a real baptism of the holy ghost the reason why i shout is because there's a god of the south on the inside of me you see when god when jesus was standing there in john 20 he said peace be unto you as my father had sent me even so i sent you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said on them receive ye the holy ghost you see it was a promise that he gave them and breathed upon them that it was a promise receive you the holy ghost it was a promise and they went up there in the upper room to wait for that promise to be fulfilled there's a promise hanging over all over all of you today it's the same thing when we lay our hands on the sick we wait because there's a promise laying there that you shall recover that same wind that came down on the day of pentecost is pushing through this place it's just not pushing through a hippodrome that the prophet was standing in and the wind would come through and blow his coat tail when the voice of god has spoke that same unity is in the body right now and that same wind it's one to push out your sin it's one to set your soul on fire it's one to tell you that you've got the power on the inside of you to get up out of that grave i've seen that same wind produce the same actions that are produced in the early apostles i've seen when i lay hands on the sick and i watched him recover you come too late to tell me that god don't heal no more he said why you keep preaching that your daddy's gonna get healed because god never changed his mind about it why am i preaching that you can have that same pentecostal experience because god didn't take his word back [Applause] i've seen little girls that didn't know how to walk bound in a wheelchair get up out of a wheelchair and start walking i seen an old man whole man come up out of a tent meeting and come walking down an aisle just like his he was walking with a cane while the preaching of the word was going forth he'd come walking with that cane he could barely get up there but when he got up close to where the anointing was he dropped the cane and ran back to his pew if you felt like i felt you'd be shouting too i've seen a man that was told by the highest positions in the land you got four months to live and i watched a so-called dead man stand behind the pulpit and said son of man prophesy these bundled bones will live again what was it what was it it was testifying of an empty grave when hattie walter said you take me through that prayer line no matter what happens if i die you take me through that prayer what was it it's because she was looking at an empty grave what was it what was it when georgie carter had enough faith to get up out of the bed what was it she was looking at an empty grave what was it when the prophet walked into that room where brother elijah had done died and he went to comfort the family what was he doing it was testify of an empty grave when somebody grabbed him a hand come and grabbed him and he went over there and laid his hands on brother elijah had a dumbbell dead and they covered him up with a sheet and before he knew it he said i was laying on top of him and saying brother elijah i called for you he went into that spirit land what was it prophesied that there was an empty grave i can't walk that way i don't know if i can i don't know if i can go that far you can go that far you can go that far you can have that holy ghost you can have that deliverance you can have that clear mind you can have it that's right come on jesus isn't just an option jesus ain't even the best option he's the only option the only option for hattie waldrop he was the only option for georgie carter he was the only option for lazarus he was the only option are you with me he was the only option lazarus had a far more bad condition that you got he was dead some of you may still have this condition stinking laid up in a grave for four days jesus was his only option do you think lazarus was looking around saying well is there a physician that could come and put an essential oil on my head that make me rise up i don't think he put no peppermint on him he probably what else you got spearmint peppermint digest i don't think digest would have worked on lazarus help me lord but lazarus when mary and martha's looking if he really loved me surely he would have come and got him but you see jesus knew the power of the grave was getting ready to be destroyed [Applause] you can get out of your condition because there is a grave that's already destroyed [Applause] you can get up out of your grave because the conditions of life were stripped from satan at calvary jesus is the only option he's an option over addiction he's the option over alcohol he's an option he's the option he's the option he's the option over cancer he's the option he's the option over the grave he's an option over your deadness he's the option over cobit he's the option over your fear he's the option he's the option can you imagine as lazarus has done went into another realm as he breaks into this realm and he goes there can you imagine as he's breaking into this realm and he starts having a conversation with abraham the one the one that you counted on all of your life the one that spoke to you and he told you he told you that everything's going to be all right you're going to bring forth that son that you're going to bring this thing you're going to come out of that the one that told you all of these things are happening i was just with him i was just with him can you imagine lazarus's conversation he's the head of the party everybody's saying what's going on up there he's a brother's eyes of jacob he gathered them all around he grabbed ezekiel grabbed isaiah he grabbed him to come here the one that you've been looking for that could get us out of this grave i'm going to tell you something you better get ready the lamb has come he's taken away the sin of the world he's making his way to calvary get ready get ready get ready it's time to come out and all of a sudden lazarus here's a voice calling and he calls him a battle that grave it says lazarus come forth he's saying to you philip come forth andrew come forth he's your option he's your option come up out of that grave and he said loose him and let him go woman thou art loosed can you imagine being locked up in prison for something that you didn't do you imagine that i never robbed a bank but i got put in there can you imagine being locked away for something that you never did you imagine what that man would do when he got up out of that jail he would probably come out probably kiss the ground that he was walking in and start shouting because he'd come out of something that he never did to get himself in there you can walk out of the grave because you didn't deserve to be there if he walked out of the grave i'm walking too oh if he walked out of the grave i'mma walk into how many is willing when the wind starts coming over you you recognize i felt that before i've handled that before i've seen young people get touched by that same wind before i can have that i can have that i can get out of my dry condition i can get out of my sin i can get out of it and we start here rattling and we start hearing a satan because there ain't no grave gonna hold a body down when you've got the same power of the son of man living in you son of man can these bones live again i've been quickened i've been made alive i know what it's like to be dead but i know what it's like to be alive in jesus can you imagine them trying to tell lazarus you're going back to the grave where you came from and they try to steer him back into the grave you need to be scared lazarus when they come back over in john chapter 12 and they tried to put him to death because of his testimony do you think it scared lazarus he just come out of the worst conditions that you could ever get out of and the prophet said he's standing there that great goliath trying to scare the liver out of you you have done been made alive in jesus he can't scare you because you who are once there in the trespasses of your sins you hath he quickened well come on down here gabriel put your foot on atlanta sea but don't you blow that trumpet gabriel until you hear from me [Applause] jesus had so much faith in the word that he trusted his own body to go to the grave how much more how much more can you trust his word to get out of sickness really how much more can you trust him to get out of that condition if jesus so trusted so trusted a backslidden preacher's word to get up out of that grave how much more can you young people every person sitting here how much more can you trust him he said i am the lord thy god that heals all of thy diseases by his tribes i am healed i am the lord thy god that delivers i am the lord thy god that sets free i am the lord thy god that fills you with the holy ghost i am the lord thy god that pours out the same anointing that came down on pentecost i am the lord thy god that came with a russian mighty wind i am the lord thy god with the same anointing of a mighty angel and i'm watching my body i'm watching my body start taking what i said hey get up out of that condition you were not built for the grave you were built for the rapture between the morning hours of six and nine you're coming up out of this ground you imagine enoch's last day as he's walking as he's talking with the lord the prophet said he was the very first one he was the very first one to take an airplane ride to heaven and i heard the prophet when i heard him speaking over there trying to do god a service without being his will and he comes all the way down to the end of that service he said i watched as elijah stepped up into that chariot and he took him and this rope fell back down to elisha and he said one of these days he's going to unhook the horses from the bushes and he's going to take that body he was early in the morning about to break a day that angel came from heaven and he rolled that stone away you could take me to the graveyard and lay his whole body down but on resurrection morning i'm coming up out of that ground because there ain't no grave

us and we'll get above it we can try your absolute worst but there ain't no grace gonna hold this body down come on satan do your absolute worst is that all you got you ain't bad enough you can't stop

said the meal prepared we did last night we had some food available and appreciate everybody that could come to the service last night the ones that are here for the meetings we just asked that when you do get your food if you could please try to keep it out of the main church part if you could keep it in the fellowship hall or over in the activity building or outside but we're trying to keep the church and the hallways this area clean so if you could help us with that we would really appreciate that we'll give you a few more directions in a in a minute but let's just go ahead and ask the lord to bless this food amen father we thank you lord for coming by our way this morning and lord that we can hear of lord a grave that was opened 2 000 years ago the lord to type that with the many graves

businesses bless their lives father we give them to you we give ourselves to you in jesus name we pray amen you can take your seat for just a moment i'm going to ask brother tim to come and then to talk about a few things we did want to mention that when you when we do start the line we're going to be starting on this end and i'm sure he'll mention this again but we're going to be starting on these double doors over here and we're going to be going across and then down this hall over here so don't try to go in on this side we're gonna have those doors locked amen well praise the lord amen haven't we fed just wonderfully today hearing the word of god tell us real clear real loud and clear amen the dry bones will live again amen i believe that not only has we have we seen a fulfillment of that in our day where we have seen israel gather back to her homeland is ezekiel 37 had prophesied and a nation that had languished and death and died and was in the graves has now risen again and become a great and mighty nation that we know is the land of israel but you remember they're only a type of exactly where we are in time and they are only re reflecting what we are as a spiritual people amen i believe that there are people who have returned back to the homeland of the book we are the people of the book and we are here as those that have to have taken on life and i'm glad that um today that our what we look like isn't just some dead corpse as brother branham even saw he said i saw the denominations i think he mentioned nazarene in particular there in the in one vision he said kissing on the dead corpse but let me tell you friend we're we're not in that condition we're a living vibrant church that has been sent and ordained it for this hour and we are the continuation of the book of acts amen we are seeing right now a resurrection out of dark denominationalism back to the word again and i'm glad to be in this hour of resurrection we're here on countdown day they're calling it i'm sure you you have already heard and has been spoke about but we're here on countdown day where this is of course the fourth month the third day in year 21 so four three two one we're right at blastoff we're coming right down to zero amen and you're here in a countdown hour amen the seventh angel has already sounded his message and we are here in the final days as the final voice to the final age and what an age that we're living in and to think about it you have been called and predestined to be here in this hour in this time amen and i we are we're here at a very special moment here for the church here at evening light tabernacle there is um you know something that we had desired to be able to do for the people of god here in this area and our hearts always been for our young people it's never been my vision at all that you know you that you build um a exercise and game events and things like that to attract young people to the church or to keep them in the church that's never been a part of what we believe here we believe in an old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost god getting a hold of their hearts changing their lives transforming them by the power of god amen there's nothing else all the gems and the exercise programs will never keep young people it's the keeping power of the blood and we believe that and we preach that and we expect god to come on the scene and feel with the holy ghost for the promises unto us to our children to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and this is what we believe that god is still calling god is still moving and god is still doing great things it was some um time ago that um i was um there in a in a a situation where we had one of our elders brother gary steinke who was um in the hospital and he was dying and um and and in this condition he had not been able to eat uh having a blockage in his bowels and diverticuli had had sealed it off or that there could be no digestion of food and then after removing a part of his colon then they put a little bag on the side but the stomach would not restart and he could not uh eat or keep anything down and so it would uh they were trying to feed him but they would just have to pump it right back out again because his stomach would not digest he was in a dying condition and in this dying condition this man has been a stalwart son of god a real child of god someone that um all we could all aspire to be like his brother gary steinke they're wonderful people that love god and serve the lord and have done that diligently since they were young people when they embraced the message of the hour and and um you know brother brother gary though began to have um uh tormenting spirits that was coming into his room and they were howling at him and telling him that you know that they were going to take his life they were going to ruin him and and and destroy him they caused they were just howling at him in his in his room till he was he became afraid to be able to even be alone in in the hospital room and um you know when i heard about it it made me really really angry and and i i just said you know this is not gonna happen on my watch you know as a shepherd i've got an authority there to go and cast out devils we saw something cast out last night we're a church that believes in casting out devils amen we believe that not only will spirits obey us of demons and demon powers but sin and sin disease has got to flee and that's called conversion amen we we have a whole altar here because we believe in an altar we believe in an experience with god we believe in a dying out to sin and um but anyway with brother gary in his uh dying condition there i i i decided i'm going to go to his hotel to his um his place where he's at in his room in the in the hospital and i'm going to confront the demons that have been tormenting him i said it's not going to happen he's 70 plus years older i've been if it was god's time to take him well he could take him that's fine but no devil was going to torment him he didn't have a right to we're children of god i believe that i don't believe we have a that the devil has a right to us to torment our lives and not with sickness not with disease not with sin not with habits not with anything the devil has no right to us we're the children of the most high god and we have a divine heritage and we have a commission to cast him out we don't have to live with devils amen we can rise up above it as brother andrew preach there's no grave you name it that can hold us down we're the children of the most high god amen and and there as i went to his room to pray with him i i text brother timothy and told him i said pray with me i'm going to go into this hospital room to pray with brother gary and he wrote me back he said dad remember we are writing the book of acts and i walked in there with a purpose i walked in there with a purpose and as i went into that hospital room my wife and i he was so low that i couldn't hear what he said so i drew up a chair beside his bed and i began to talk to him and he began to talk to me and it was so low i'd have to hold my uh voice so low i'd have to hold my ear down to near him so i could catch what he was saying and as he did he shared with me the desires that he had in his heart and some of them was for his family and and accommodations that was needed and situations you know for those who come from far off and and different things and and so you know they as he as he shared with me the very these very things there the holy spirit um fell down in the room and and god gave me the gave me the unction to address the demons that was troubling him and i rebuked them and commanded them to leave him by that evening he was eating jell-o and he was back on his road to health and a few months they reattached his colon and and so on like that until he was a well man again this is the god we serve amen this is the god we serve ain't no grave gonna take us prematurely amen the grave has no power over us we have power over death hell and the grave amen this is this is the promise that as god has given anyway as i left from there i realized that god had given me a mandate now i was 60 years old we had a church we had the fellowship hall we had um other buildings there administration building we had a place out in the country as far as i was concerned we you know i i had no ego destroy to stroke i had no desire as far as you know i just thought this would be would serve us till the lord came but looking around i realized that the things that he had asked me to do and the lord had blessed in this conversation and it confirmed it that we we were landlocked and we were unable to accomplish those things in that location and um so we looked around and the parking lot was full and the church we it was the sanctuary was getting where we were out growing it the uh where the children had a church and sunday school they were out of room and the fellowship hall was too small and and um just realizing that you know that we got to tarry till he comes and that i i don't want to be a man that's just found with a bunch of money in my pocket and i didn't use it for the things of god and so you know we we started there looking and we um you know eventually after trying different things on august uh uh the eighth in 2014 now nearly seven years ago we purchased this acreage here and um you know and we and i first thought we'd just build a pavilion and we would start there and maybe we could put some camper spots around it and we'd still stay where we're at but because we were out of room everywhere and there was needs and we we needed to we needed a better way to for the internet to be able to reach the uh the outlying areas around us and also to be a witness around the world some people wonder why do you have your services online well i'll tell you you know it's um it's just like this there was a little lady over in in england that she was down praying and as she was praying she the the prophecy came and it said deep color to the deep and she said well i don't understand that i think that's in the bible so she went and found the verse in the bible and then after finding it in the bible she still said well there's something about this that god's trying to tell us so she she got on the computer and she went to and and and put in the words deep color to the deep it brought her to the man william branham which took her to brother biskell's um uh website and there i was preaching and as i was preaching there you know the you know there um as i left from there she followed us right over to eveninglight.net and began to listen to all of the services would even be up in three and four o'clock in the morning when our services was off time with england and and would listen to the services you know god's got his way of reaching the predestinated sea around the world amen so god knows how to do it and there have been many lives that have been touched because of it and that's only one of the testimonies that we could give but many many hundreds of lives that have been touched as the gospel must be preached around the world and then shall the end come but anyway we we went through the times of uh where that we we laid the the foundations and we built this building and uh you know sometimes people have criticized me for um extravagance and said well this is just um too much it reminds me of judas you know who wanted to who was angry because he anointed jesus with this expensive oil and said it should have been sold and given to the poor and my reply is you know yeah i understand there are those who have not and those that are not blessed in in in the way that we are and you know if you're really really concerned about it just go sell your nice house and give it to them but you want to continue living in a nice house and driving a nice car then don't complain about my church but either way regardless of whether you complain or not i'm going to do what god called me to do anyhow now now you know we we are come now to this point and this is where that we're coming to and i want to share this scripture with you from psalm 68 11 the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it now after we have been into this building now as we took about three years to build it and everything that you see on this property the property the the church the parking lot the the the new building that we're fixing to dedicate everything that we have god gave it to us debt free we don't owe a dime on it never have and never will and i want to say that this is an amazing accomplishment of god working through his people certainly god has wrought wonders although he used his people who caught a vision to achieve it and i'm delighted that god has surrounded me with capable men and women who allows god to use them and while his people have certainly lent to god their talents and their hands it was god who gave the direction and the strength and made the provisions and when i think about how this uh you know how all this began i'm stunned and amazed and i can never drive up to this place without just thanking god for what he's done it's a miracle all every every step of the way the miraculous hands of god you know if you if you're wondering whether god's still a god of miracles just look right here at evening like tabernacle we can start with one miracle after miracle after miracle this church is founded on miracles that gods did and he continues to do as a sick or healed as as the lost or saved as those that have been in drugs and and and horrible situation drunkards or whatever are delivered in the name of jesus christ miracles continue to happen because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever now surely we can see it all began because the lord gave the word there in the hospital room where the doctors had done their best using their skillful knowledge and their talents that was given by god and yet with all the knowledge with all the skills and abilities of mankind when all of that had been spent and gary steinke was laying there dying and they were trying to keep him alive he still was in a dying condition till jesus came and the day jesus walked into that room and i'll be honest i had been in the room before i had prayed prayers for him before i'd asked god to heal him before i had prayed many prayers for him already in these 21 days but that day jesus came in and when jesus came in that day and the spirit of god dropped down there was a healing that began and the deliverance that had been did that took place and and what what he had what he said to me that day must have pleased the lord as the holy spirit dropped down in that room and and i cursed those demons that were taken as life and in the spirit we were able to reach down into realms that doctors could not reach and and so as by evening that day as i said he was starting to eat jello and and from there went right on back to the road of health and and you know as i considered what pleased the lord i realized i had a commission to carry out and as as i said my my first thoughts was to build a pavilion and that we would provide that with you know an area and maybe set up some camping spots or different things and you know some error some ways to make accommodation for for the people and you know i then i realized we had a greater need we had a need of getting an area where we could where we could be a lighthouse that the evening light would come out from under the bushel out of the woods i had a vision and to understand that god had given me a commission he put the money in my hands and we we used it for his glory and we paid for this building and completed it and then a couple of years ago we started again and that was to build this pavilion that we started out to build now our trustees are are practical people we have men in this church like brother james mitchell that you know he he has a vision when we do something don't do it halfway do it right and so when he looked at this thoughts of the pavilion he said you know why have an open i have it all open why can't we use this and fix it where we can use it year round so we put sides on it it's air conditioned heated where we can use it 365 days out of the year where it's comfortable all the time we did this because we we realized that investing in our young people is investing in god's future and as long as we're here we have a future and when we step from beyond there we got a greater future in the eternities and so as we did we we built this pavilion and just this day by the miraculous hands of god and him working through his people we have been able to get the fire marshal approval and the opening up of a new facility here at evening light tabernacle a pavilion that we have made as i was on the grand jury here some um i think it was year before last and i in my rural parish that i live in we call them parishes here's their counties in the rural county where i live there was um a um a woman that was um claimed to be a recruiter for colleges and so on and she was taking young young men and and and taking them and introducing them to pornography and giving pictures of herself and doing sex acts and and and uh taking delight and taking their virginity that was right here in our parish right in a local and you know in rural louisiana and i realized that you know we need a safe place for our young people whether they're not pushed out into among the wolves in in in some of the the areas where that they had been doing things uh like um meeting together and and in playing ball and and basketball or whatever they was doing there in the in in the town of menden i realized we needed a more safer environment for our young people and that our young people were worth invested in and so because of that we have finished this project we are going to dedicate it today and um when i'm going to be dismissing you in a moment and i'd like you to walk out with us out here into the parking lot and where i'll stand on the step with the ministers and we will we will pray and we will ask god's blessings upon the the fruit of our hands and where we have labored and over what god has given us and and also to dedicate it for the the young people and for the other events that will be taking place there and i want to just say to even like tabernacle you people here you're the greatest in the world you have given you have you have given and you've sweated you've labored with your hands you've spent long hours you have sweat equity and everything that we have and i want to say you have caught a vision you have seen the light and this light is leading us on beyond this realm into another realm into glory we're looking for that great light to come down where that we leave until change from mortal to immortality and thank you for giving unto the lord god bless you amen wouldn't you stand together with me thank you thank you brothers and sisters thank you for all you've given to the lord and thank you lord for what you have done amen now as we have been instructed we are going to be going right out here and we're going to we're going to go out into the parking lot and gather in front of the building and the ministry and i will we'll go out and we'll just have prayer over that and dedicated unto the lord and when you are through if you will you you will come back and go through the front of this building right around over them this hallway into the fellowship hall area and there we we have a meal prepared for you i'm sorry we couldn't have youth camp like we normally do and but however we have made it worth that we could feed you at least this one meal today and some sandwich things at night so because our area there's no restaurants to go run to to go and um get get what you need so we we're trying our best to be accommodating as possible so remember that and and and again please you know don't take food past the fellowship hall back in to these hallways into the into the rooms and so on like that that this is not a place for eating or drinking keep that out and no no children running up and down the hallways please you know parents you mind your kids and know what's happening and i don't have to talk to these young adults i'm talking about little children you understand that you you young people know know how to behave and i so highly respect you you're wonderful young people and god bless you amen let's give a hand clap for the young people in this message hallelujah you may argue against the message you may debate whether it's right or wrong you may say god's you know this is not god's prophet but you can't argue with the results that we are producing god bless you i'll meet you out there saying something you
