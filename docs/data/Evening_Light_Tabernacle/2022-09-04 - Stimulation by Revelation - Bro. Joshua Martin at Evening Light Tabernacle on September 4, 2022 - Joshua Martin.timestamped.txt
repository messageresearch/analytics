[56:58] amen is that your desire this morning
[57:02] more of him
[57:04] too many people puts a period on the
[57:06] relationship with god
[57:08] but we need to have an experience every
[57:09] day amen if you have your bibles let's
[57:12] turn to revelation six and six
[57:15] i'm just a i'm a simple preacher so i
[57:17] pray something can be said this morning
[57:19] to be a blessing amen amen it's good to
[57:21] see another oaky this morning sister
[57:23] alex and we're we're fighting hard
[57:26] feelings back home y'all are taking her
[57:27] from us
[57:28] but we're excited
[57:31] to see what god has in store for their
[57:32] lives
[57:33] amen before we read can we bow our heads
[57:36] dear heavenly father lord we want to
[57:38] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[57:40] god
[57:41] you've been so good to us lord you
[57:43] brought us to your house safely god give
[57:45] us this opportunity to come into your
[57:48] presence lord you place a desire in our
[57:50] hearts to come into your house lord not
[57:52] everybody has that desire and we want to
[57:54] stop and say thank you for it father
[57:56] lord as we enter to this part of the
[57:58] service i ask that you would anoint me
[58:00] god as i lay myself aside i've studied
[58:02] for today lord i ask that you would
[58:04] speak to these lips of clay father may
[58:06] the words that you have for this service
[58:08] be spoken we ask these things in your
[58:10] precious name amen
[58:12] revelation 6 and 6
[58:14] and i heard a voice in the midst of the
[58:16] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[58:19] penny and three measures of barley for a
[58:21] penny and see the heart not the oil and
[58:24] the wine you may be seated this this
[58:26] morning
[58:27] and got a simple subject could be
[58:29] stimulation
[58:30] by revelation brother branham i know
[58:32] with a lot of these things we all know i
[58:34] know y'all are well taught here so i'm
[58:36] not bringing nothing new this morning
[58:38] but i ask that you would just enter in
[58:39] with me and see what the lord has in
[58:41] store but the brand themselves now oil
[58:43] templify spirit
[58:44] wine symbolizes stimulation of
[58:46] revelation boy i like to run all over
[58:49] the place it's a wonder i didn't wake up
[58:51] the neighborhood when the lord showed me
[58:53] that stimulation of revelation and i'm
[58:55] so glad that brother branham wasn't too
[58:57] prideful to get excited about revelation
[59:00] brother branham wasn't too st too stuck
[59:02] up or too big of a name to get excited
[59:04] about what the lord is doing in his life
[59:07] and i don't believe we got to be ashamed
[59:09] of what the lord is doing in our life if
[59:11] god's done something for you we've got a
[59:13] right to express our feelings you know
[59:15] i'm just going to preach this morning
[59:17] but there's too many people going around
[59:19] saying we can't praise the lord we can't
[59:20] worship the lord we can't lift our hands
[59:22] but i believe if you're born again and
[59:24] god has done something for you you've
[59:26] got every right to lift up your hands
[59:28] and praise the lord you've got every
[59:30] right to say god you healed my body and
[59:32] i'm going to praise you for it you know
[59:34] we get we get labeled pentecostal but i
[59:36] started thinking about it that
[59:38] pentecostal is just mimicking what the
[59:40] bride's got what's a counterfeit you've
[59:42] never seen a counterfeit four to four
[59:44] dollar bill because there's not one out
[59:46] there but there are counterfeit one
[59:48] dollar bills five dollar bills ten
[59:49] dollar bills they're taking a genuine
[59:52] and mimicking it so if the pentecostals
[59:55] can praise the lord and they're just
[59:57] amendment oh come on somebody they're
[59:59] just a counterfeit what can the bride of
[1:00:02] christ do when they got the revealed
[1:00:04] word in their midst we got a right to
[1:00:06] praise the lord we got a right to shout
[1:00:08] and rejoice because not everybody can
[1:00:11] see what god is doing in this day but
[1:00:14] you've got a desire you've got something
[1:00:16] in your heart to see the word of god oh
[1:00:19] my in that same quote he says old and
[1:00:21] wine and the bible is associated
[1:00:23] together always i got the concordance
[1:00:25] out and looked and there's a string of
[1:00:27] them like that where wine and oil goes
[1:00:29] together all the time see so oil
[1:00:32] symbolizes spirit and wine symbolizes
[1:00:34] stimulation of revelation and these two
[1:00:37] work together you can't have revelation
[1:00:40] without have the holy ghost and you
[1:00:42] can't have the holy ghost without it
[1:00:44] leading you to a revelation but you got
[1:00:46] to have the spirit and the truth to
[1:00:49] produce a revelation too many people
[1:00:52] thinks we're going to have all word but
[1:00:54] no spirit all that's going to do is
[1:00:56] produce an intellectual conception then
[1:00:58] you got the other side that believes
[1:01:00] it's all spirits and no word we don't
[1:01:02] need the deep things of god all that's
[1:01:04] going to do is produce an emotion
[1:01:07] produce this sensation but when spirit
[1:01:09] and truth comes together it's going to
[1:01:11] produce what god has for this last day
[1:01:14] what did jesus say they that worship me
[1:01:16] must worship me in spirit and in truth
[1:01:19] but you notice how he said that must
[1:01:22] worship me he didn't say if you feel
[1:01:24] like it or if you want to but you must
[1:01:27] worship in spirit the holy ghost and in
[1:01:30] truth the things of the word and my
[1:01:32] produces a stimulation by revelation you
[1:01:36] see brother branham says that the only
[1:01:38] thing that you're ever going the only
[1:01:39] way you're ever going to get it a
[1:01:41] revelation has to come from god it never
[1:01:44] comes by human natural endowments but by
[1:01:47] spiritual endowment you can even
[1:01:49] memorize the scripture so we're saying
[1:01:52] here you can take the intellectual side
[1:01:54] of it and memorize scripture and though
[1:01:57] that's wonderful that won't do it it has
[1:02:00] to be a revelation from god it says in
[1:02:03] the word that no man can say that jesus
[1:02:05] is the christ except by the holy ghost
[1:02:09] you have to receive the holy ghost then
[1:02:11] and only then can the spirit give you
[1:02:14] the revelation that jesus is the christ
[1:02:17] so you can't even say jesus is the
[1:02:19] christ without the holy ghost
[1:02:21] oh my so you see the importance of the
[1:02:24] holy ghost you look at second uh
[1:02:26] corinthians 3 and 6 who also hath made
[1:02:29] us able ministers of the new testament
[1:02:32] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[1:02:34] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[1:02:37] life so you can't have all word without
[1:02:40] the spirit and what you can't have all
[1:02:42] spirit without the word there's the
[1:02:44] middle line and i believe the holy ghost
[1:02:47] is to guide us into the message of the
[1:02:49] hour you look at john 16 and 13 how be
[1:02:52] it when he the spirit of truth is come
[1:02:55] he will guide you into all truth not
[1:02:58] portions of the truth but he's to guide
[1:03:00] you into all truth you see brother
[1:03:02] branham says the methodists have
[1:03:04] portions of truth the pentecostals have
[1:03:07] portions of truth about this have
[1:03:09] portions of truth but they're taking a
[1:03:11] portion of truth and denominating around
[1:03:14] it instead of moving on into all truth
[1:03:17] and we can do the same thing in the
[1:03:18] message we can take our favorite quotes
[1:03:21] and say i got truth but push away the
[1:03:23] rest of the message that's going to
[1:03:25] produce a powerless life that's going to
[1:03:27] produce a powerless hope but you want a
[1:03:30] powerful home you want a powerful family
[1:03:32] you want a powerful church stick with
[1:03:34] the message of the hour not portions of
[1:03:37] the message but be led into all truth
[1:03:40] all of the message you see the holy
[1:03:42] ghost is to take away all of your
[1:03:44] thinking so that the headship of the
[1:03:46] word can take preeminence into your life
[1:03:49] so no longer are you thinking your own
[1:03:51] thoughts and what you think is right but
[1:03:54] now you're thinking god's thoughts which
[1:03:56] is the message of the hour what are
[1:03:58] prophets a prophet is a mouthpiece of
[1:04:00] god what is the word expressed it's
[1:04:02] first a thought so before you before i'm
[1:04:05] speaking these words it's a thought in
[1:04:07] my head so before we got the message of
[1:04:10] the hour it was spots in the thought in
[1:04:12] the mind of god so he sent those
[1:04:14] thoughts to a prophet and as that
[1:04:17] prophet began to speak the message speak
[1:04:20] those thoughts it became word form and
[1:04:22] now there's a bride on earth that's
[1:04:24] under the spirit of truth and no longer
[1:04:27] leaving out her own thoughts but she's
[1:04:29] coming under the message of the hour
[1:04:31] which is the thoughts of god and now
[1:04:34] we're making the word manifest on earth
[1:04:37] just like jesus made the word manifested
[1:04:40] when he was on earth i don't believe
[1:04:42] that we got the message in this last day
[1:04:44] to puff up our head knowledge we didn't
[1:04:46] get the message in this last day just to
[1:04:49] show how smart we are but we got the
[1:04:51] message in this day so that the word can
[1:04:54] walk on earth just like it did when
[1:04:56] jesus was on earth with the same signs
[1:04:59] the same wonders i believe we can lay
[1:05:01] hands on the and they shall be
[1:05:03] covered we can we can die god walk on
[1:05:05] serpents that shall not harm us what is
[1:05:08] it we are coming under the headship of
[1:05:10] the word of god and it's producing the
[1:05:13] same signs oh my but branham says that's
[1:05:16] exactly when the church and the word has
[1:05:18] to be won just like god jesus and god
[1:05:21] was one just exactly god was in christ
[1:05:25] reconciling the world to himself so will
[1:05:27] christ have to be in the church the
[1:05:30] anointed word to make everything
[1:05:32] fulfilled so in order to fulfill the
[1:05:36] word for this day the anointed word has
[1:05:39] to take preeminence in a body
[1:05:43] oh my i'm gonna say it again in order
[1:05:45] for the thoughts of god to be fulfilled
[1:05:48] in this last day somebody has to accept
[1:05:51] the thoughts of god and say god i'm
[1:05:54] pushing away my thinking and embracing
[1:05:57] your thinking
[1:05:58] [Applause]
[1:06:00] man's thoughts ain't going to produce a
[1:06:01] rapture
[1:06:02] man's thoughts ain't gonna produce a
[1:06:04] body change man's parts ain't gonna
[1:06:07] bring that's the future home but the
[1:06:09] thoughts of god will produce a body
[1:06:12] change in everybody that's coming under
[1:06:15] the headship of the message oh my too
[1:06:18] many people is hanging on to their own
[1:06:21] thoughts but are refusing to come under
[1:06:24] the thoughts of god
[1:06:26] hey hope this is okay this morning
[1:06:28] refusing to come under the thoughts of
[1:06:31] god well that's just his opinion
[1:06:35] is that really thus saith the lord
[1:06:37] right there you're embracing your
[1:06:39] thoughts and pushing away god's thoughts
[1:06:43] oh i believe god anointed i'm a firm
[1:06:45] believer in the message i know some of
[1:06:47] you some of you y'all might not know me
[1:06:49] but let me just introduce myself i'm a
[1:06:51] firm believer in the message so if you
[1:06:54] come to hear the message of the hour
[1:06:56] this morning you're going to hear it and
[1:06:58] so i believe god anointed a prophet and
[1:07:00] gave us a message not his ideas but
[1:07:04] god's thoughts to get a bride ready for
[1:07:07] a rapture to get a bride ready for the
[1:07:10] future home and it's only through the
[1:07:12] message of the hour is there going to be
[1:07:15] a rapture
[1:07:16] oh what's the bible say faith cometh by
[1:07:18] hearing and hearing the word of god
[1:07:22] not the word and man's ideas
[1:07:26] not the word of man's opinions not the
[1:07:28] word of what you think is right but
[1:07:30] faith only comes by the word of god and
[1:07:33] that's why we needed a message
[1:07:36] because the bible got scrupled up
[1:07:38] throughout the church ages that's why
[1:07:40] there's some believing in three gods
[1:07:42] some say you got to be sprinkled some
[1:07:44] say this and some say that all reading
[1:07:47] out of the same bible
[1:07:50] all reading out of the same bible but
[1:07:53] are coming up with different
[1:07:54] interpretations
[1:07:56] coming up with different ideas but the
[1:07:59] message comes to do away with man's
[1:08:01] interpretation and give god's
[1:08:04] interpretation
[1:08:06] with god's interpretation comes an
[1:08:08] authority to make the message live
[1:08:12] with god's interpretation comes the
[1:08:15] power to take the message off of the
[1:08:17] ipads take the message off of the tape
[1:08:20] player take the message off of the
[1:08:23] computers and make it live
[1:08:26] but it's only through god's
[1:08:27] interpretation
[1:08:29] oh my what's the bible say the spirit
[1:08:31] and the bride say come
[1:08:33] the spirit and the bride so the spirit
[1:08:36] that anointed brother branham to say
[1:08:38] something the bride has come under the
[1:08:41] same anointing the same inspiration and
[1:08:43] they're picking up the same thought
[1:08:45] pattern
[1:08:47] oh now the same thought proud of brother
[1:08:49] branham wasn't his thought pattern it
[1:08:51] was god's thought pattern so when we
[1:08:53] come under the same inspiration we're
[1:08:55] getting the same thought pattern
[1:08:58] come on somebody just like brother
[1:09:00] branham have the third pull in action i
[1:09:02] believe the bride of christ has the same
[1:09:04] authority on the inside of your life
[1:09:07] under the headship of the message oh you
[1:09:10] look at hattie wright brother branham
[1:09:12] was telling the stories of the telling
[1:09:13] the story of the three squirrels that he
[1:09:15] spoke into existence he was telling them
[1:09:18] about the inspiration about the third
[1:09:20] pool then what happened there was a
[1:09:22] little young lady there was a little
[1:09:23] mama that might not have been important
[1:09:26] but the brandon says she barely made any
[1:09:28] money at all
[1:09:29] but she came under the same inspiration
[1:09:33] she was hearing the word come forth she
[1:09:36] was hearing the thoughts of god come
[1:09:37] forth and she says that's nothing but
[1:09:40] the truth she come under the same
[1:09:42] inspiration that the prophet was under
[1:09:45] and what happened it produced the same
[1:09:47] signs
[1:09:48] it produced the same actions oh my
[1:09:51] brother branham stop and he says you
[1:09:53] speak the word what do you have needed
[1:09:56] you speak the word of god and god will
[1:09:58] give it to you he says if you win a
[1:10:00] million dollars god will give it to you
[1:10:03] you want your sister to be healed god
[1:10:05] will give it to you and what does she
[1:10:06] say she says i want my boys to be saved
[1:10:10] and brother branham says those boys were
[1:10:12] over on the corner laughing and
[1:10:13] snickering and making fun of what was
[1:10:16] going on
[1:10:17] let me say this you want your children
[1:10:19] safe get in the message i don't care how
[1:10:22] far they're gone how lost they are you
[1:10:24] want your loved ones to
[1:10:26] get under the inspiration of this
[1:10:29] message
[1:10:30] oh brother josh you don't know how far
[1:10:32] she's gone you don't know how far he's
[1:10:34] gone i don't care i know of the grace of
[1:10:37] god
[1:10:38] and under the inspiration of the message
[1:10:41] is the power to speak the word
[1:10:44] and things has to materialize
[1:10:47] now i know there's some that's taking it
[1:10:49] as a prosperity gospel saying yeah i
[1:10:52] want to speak for a call i'm going to
[1:10:53] speak for that that's not the way it
[1:10:55] works but i believe you can speak over a
[1:10:57] loved one
[1:10:58] sister kimberly where are you in the
[1:11:00] building system this morning you're a
[1:11:02] witness of what god can do through a
[1:11:05] young person under the inspiration of
[1:11:07] the message
[1:11:09] that's not for sister kimbers just for
[1:11:12] sister kimberly that's for everybody
[1:11:14] that's under the inspiration of the
[1:11:17] message
[1:11:18] [Applause]
[1:11:20] oh i hope this is okay this morning but
[1:11:22] hattie wright says i want my boy saved
[1:11:24] and brother says god gives them to you
[1:11:26] and what happens the boys fall over her
[1:11:29] lap crying weeping their way to calvary
[1:11:31] god filled them with the holy ghost it
[1:11:34] was a mama that pushed away what she
[1:11:37] thought was right
[1:11:38] pushed away her thinking and embraced
[1:11:42] god's thinking
[1:11:43] then the thinking of god started to
[1:11:45] materialize in her life
[1:11:48] oh my that's what revelation does it
[1:11:51] takes something that we couldn't
[1:11:52] understand before and starts to reveal
[1:11:56] itself you see how come this bride is
[1:11:58] being stimulated how come she's happy
[1:12:01] how come she's got joy and peace in the
[1:12:04] midst of the trial is because the word
[1:12:06] that was twisted up by man's ideas has
[1:12:09] been revealed with the same power and
[1:12:11] same authority it's same anointing you
[1:12:14] see this message has enlightened our
[1:12:16] eyes of our understanding we're no
[1:12:18] longer looking for man's interpretation
[1:12:21] but now we're looking through god's
[1:12:22] interpretation you see well you see you
[1:12:25] see through human interpretation we will
[1:12:28] never know what the book says brother
[1:12:30] branham says that revelations is a book
[1:12:32] of symbols how would we know what the
[1:12:35] book of symbols said if god didn't give
[1:12:38] us the interpretation of the book of
[1:12:40] symbols
[1:12:42] i know where i know this is all you know
[1:12:44] you've heard all this before but this is
[1:12:47] something that's become a reality to me
[1:12:49] we needed a message so that we can
[1:12:52] understand what god has in this day you
[1:12:56] see but the brandon didn't come to do
[1:12:58] away with the scriptures he come to give
[1:13:00] an interpretation of the scriptures
[1:13:02] jesus would say in matthew 5 and 17
[1:13:05] think not that i come to destroy the law
[1:13:08] all the prophets have not come to
[1:13:10] destroy but i come to fulfill but the
[1:13:13] brandon says the christ was magnifying
[1:13:16] the law he was taking what was written
[1:13:18] in the past and magnifying it and
[1:13:21] bringing the true interpretation jesus
[1:13:24] says you have heard of them saying of
[1:13:26] all time thou shalt not kill whosoever
[1:13:28] shall kill shall be in danger of the
[1:13:30] judgment but i say unto you whosoever is
[1:13:33] angry with thy brother without a cause
[1:13:36] shall be in danger of the judgment he
[1:13:38] was saying they say of old but i'm
[1:13:40] bringing the interpretation of what they
[1:13:43] are saying
[1:13:44] oh my you have heard him said uh them of
[1:13:47] those that shall not commit adultery but
[1:13:49] i say unto you whosoever looketh upon a
[1:13:52] woman to lust after her have committed
[1:13:55] adultery he wasn't doing away with the
[1:13:57] law he was bringing the true
[1:14:00] interpretation of the law and this
[1:14:03] message ain't doing away with the
[1:14:05] scriptures it's bringing the true
[1:14:07] interpretation of the scriptures brother
[1:14:10] branham would say moses had a scriptural
[1:14:13] sign he was that great prophet of god
[1:14:15] that went down there to deliver them
[1:14:17] they recognized it they recognized the
[1:14:19] sign he was the exact scriptural sign
[1:14:22] promised vindicated and jesus was the
[1:14:25] promise of the scripture vindicated to
[1:14:28] the woman at the well or he was the
[1:14:30] interpretation jesus was the
[1:14:32] interpretation of scripture his own life
[1:14:35] interpreted the scripture then he stops
[1:14:38] and he says don't you see the message
[1:14:41] don't you see the message of the hour
[1:14:43] can you recognize where we are at the
[1:14:46] message itself from scripture interprets
[1:14:49] to you the hour that we're living in
[1:14:53] so it takes scripture prophecies for
[1:14:55] this day and says hey this seems
[1:14:58] something in the future this is
[1:15:00] something right now
[1:15:02] you show your hands on this sick and
[1:15:03] then shall recover that ain't something
[1:15:05] in the past that ain't something in the
[1:15:07] future but that is right now repent and
[1:15:10] be baptized and you shall receive the
[1:15:12] gift of the holy ghost that ain't
[1:15:14] something for just the past that ain't
[1:15:16] something in the future but that's
[1:15:18] something right now he brought an
[1:15:20] interpretation and says this is the time
[1:15:23] the hour the moment for scripture to be
[1:15:26] fulfilled
[1:15:27] oh my i'm so grateful for that that the
[1:15:30] message brought the interpretation
[1:15:32] brother branhammer says have you ever
[1:15:34] thought how great this is what what
[1:15:36] could you give in exchange for this day
[1:15:39] of confusion he says this is a day of
[1:15:41] confusion but what could we give to what
[1:15:45] can we get to give up the day of
[1:15:47] confusion this day when people don't
[1:15:49] know what to do which way to go the
[1:15:52] bible says these things would come that
[1:15:54] there would be a famine in the land not
[1:15:56] for bread or for water but for hearing
[1:15:58] get this part but for hearing the true
[1:16:01] word of god
[1:16:03] the true word of god not what this one
[1:16:06] says mixed with the word of god but the
[1:16:09] true word of god and the people would go
[1:16:12] from east to west from north to south
[1:16:15] seeking to hear the true word of god and
[1:16:18] here we are privileged tonight to see
[1:16:20] the message of god
[1:16:23] don't take for granted the sherman
[1:16:25] message church
[1:16:28] come on somebody don't take for granted
[1:16:30] that you can understand the message
[1:16:33] because not everybody can understand it
[1:16:36] oh jesus the disciples asked jesus why
[1:16:38] he spoke in parables and he says it has
[1:16:41] not given them to know the mysteries of
[1:16:44] the kingdom of god but to you it is
[1:16:47] given
[1:16:48] the disciples asked him how come you're
[1:16:51] speaking in a parable how come you're
[1:16:53] speaking in a mysterious way because he
[1:16:56] was saying this ain't for them it's for
[1:16:58] you
[1:17:00] oh and the same thing is happening in
[1:17:02] this last day the message came forth but
[1:17:04] the but the denominations can't
[1:17:06] understand it it's not given for them to
[1:17:09] understand it's given for you to
[1:17:12] understand this day this scripture is
[1:17:15] fulfilled in front of your eyes
[1:17:18] in your life
[1:17:19] oh my they couldn't understand him he
[1:17:22] was speaking in a mysterious way you see
[1:17:25] there was many in brother branham's day
[1:17:27] that says he was a great man of god he's
[1:17:30] seen he's seen visions he could read
[1:17:32] people's lives he could lay hands on the
[1:17:34] sick and they would recover then they
[1:17:36] stopped and they said but when it came
[1:17:39] to his teaching when it came to his
[1:17:41] doctrine he was off they could see the
[1:17:45] signs but whenever it came to the
[1:17:47] mysterious voice they couldn't
[1:17:49] understand it but we're not looking at a
[1:17:52] mystery we're not looking at a parable
[1:17:55] we're looking at the interpretation of
[1:17:58] the mystery we're looking at the
[1:18:00] interpretation of the parable oh matthew
[1:18:04] 11 25 says and at that time jesus
[1:18:06] answered and said i thank thee your
[1:18:08] father lord of heaven and earth because
[1:18:10] thou must hit these things from the wise
[1:18:13] uh from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:18:15] and has revealed them unto babes
[1:18:18] oh my i'm so glad he revealed this
[1:18:21] message in my life you see what did the
[1:18:24] prophet do to the prophet spoke in
[1:18:27] isaiah that there was going to be a
[1:18:28] virgin conceived that there was going to
[1:18:30] be somebody bear the life of god and
[1:18:33] that didn't happen until 400 years later
[1:18:36] but that didn't matter how long it took
[1:18:39] the word of god came forth that there
[1:18:41] was going to be a virgin conceived and
[1:18:43] then there came another prophet or
[1:18:45] another angel on earth that came to mary
[1:18:48] he didn't bring something new but he
[1:18:51] came and he told mary that this is the
[1:18:53] time for that scripture to be fulfilled
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:18:58] hope you're following me this morning
[1:18:59] gabriel didn't bring something new he
[1:19:02] says yeah i did a little study on it
[1:19:04] there was scripture after scripture
[1:19:06] after scripture that he was quoting to
[1:19:08] her whenever he was talking to her says
[1:19:11] you're blessed and highly favored he was
[1:19:13] quoting many scriptures what was he
[1:19:15] doing he wasn't bringing a new message
[1:19:18] but his message was to let mary know
[1:19:21] that this is the time for scriptures to
[1:19:24] be fulfilled
[1:19:26] oh
[1:19:27] my he was letting her know brother josh
[1:19:30] this is the time for the message to be
[1:19:32] fulfilled in your
[1:19:34] life but branham says the reason why
[1:19:38] isaiah didn't say a mary shall conceive
[1:19:41] is because all the girls would have been
[1:19:43] named mary
[1:19:44] he didn't say the name but whenever he
[1:19:47] spoke the word in the back part of god's
[1:19:50] mind he knew
[1:19:52] there was a chosen vessel on earth that
[1:19:54] was going to take the message take the
[1:19:57] word and manifest it
[1:20:00] your
[1:20:01] your physical name might not be in the
[1:20:03] bible you can't find josh martin you
[1:20:06] can't find these other names but by
[1:20:08] revelation i can say my name is in the
[1:20:11] book because of the message
[1:20:14] oh come on somebody the message didn't
[1:20:17] bring nothing new it opened my eyes and
[1:20:20] says you're more than a conqueror
[1:20:22] through christ jesus who strengthens you
[1:20:24] you shall lay hands on the and they
[1:20:26] shall recover
[1:20:27] these things they and all these things
[1:20:29] are more than controversial these are
[1:20:30] promises for you but the message comes
[1:20:34] and opens your eyes and says this is the
[1:20:37] time for a rapture this is the time for
[1:20:40] body change this is the time and you're
[1:20:43] the one to fulfill scripture
[1:20:47] you're the one to take prophecies for
[1:20:50] this day and manifest it that's why the
[1:20:53] bride can get excited because god chose
[1:20:56] me to manifest his thoughts oh
[1:21:00] my god chose the need to manifest what
[1:21:04] he has in this last day
[1:21:07] oh it was promised that the seals would
[1:21:09] be open in this day and underneath the
[1:21:12] seals
[1:21:13] was what god had for this day underneath
[1:21:15] the seals was the book of redemption
[1:21:17] your name was in the book of redemption
[1:21:20] your inheritance was in the book of
[1:21:22] redemption your authority was in the
[1:21:24] book of redemption but under the seals
[1:21:27] when the seals were still on it you
[1:21:29] couldn't see your name you was just
[1:21:31] guessing that it was there
[1:21:33] he was just guessing that you were going
[1:21:36] to see a body change but once the seals
[1:21:38] came open you could see your name and
[1:21:41] realize it's going to be revealed
[1:21:43] through me
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:46] oh
[1:21:46] my but random says he breaks the seals
[1:21:49] and reveals it gives us his inheritance
[1:21:53] to the people gives the inheritance that
[1:21:55] he inherited becoming kinsmen redeever
[1:21:58] and he freely gives it to us it all
[1:22:00] belonged to him he was the one who
[1:22:03] redeemed but instead of keeping it for
[1:22:05] himself he gives it back to the people
[1:22:10] my when adam sinned in the garden the
[1:22:12] book of the power of the spoken word
[1:22:14] went back to god
[1:22:16] so god never lost the spoken word god
[1:22:19] never lost eternal life man lost eternal
[1:22:23] life so in order for the spoken word to
[1:22:26] be redeemed back it's got to come back
[1:22:29] to who lost it
[1:22:32] so when the seals came open god wasn't
[1:22:34] going to keep the book of redemption he
[1:22:36] never lost it
[1:22:39] man lost the book of redemption
[1:22:42] man lost the spoken word man lost
[1:22:44] authority man lost a minion but once the
[1:22:48] seals came open
[1:22:50] once the seals came off the book god
[1:22:52] says i'm not going to keep it i've had
[1:22:54] it for all of these years i'm going to
[1:22:56] give it back to a young person
[1:22:59] i'm going to give it back to a mama i'm
[1:23:01] going to give it back to a daddy i'm
[1:23:03] going to give it back to somebody who
[1:23:06] thinks they're the lowest of the lowest
[1:23:08] they might not think they're anybody
[1:23:10] special but you're blessed and a highly
[1:23:12] favored
[1:23:13] you may say brother josh i'm a nobody
[1:23:16] nobody even knows my name they don't
[1:23:18] even know i'm here this morning god
[1:23:20] knows you're here this morning
[1:23:22] and the reason you're here is because
[1:23:24] god has something for you
[1:23:27] the reason you're here is because
[1:23:29] there's a drawing power on the inside of
[1:23:32] your heart to be here
[1:23:34] oh man let me just say this yeah before
[1:23:38] that drawing power was on the inside of
[1:23:40] your heart there was somebody on the
[1:23:42] other side drowning you
[1:23:45] now let me say this the devil ain't
[1:23:46] going to draw you to church
[1:23:50] oh come on somebody the devil don't want
[1:23:53] you to come to church so if there's a
[1:23:55] drawing power on the inside to be closer
[1:23:58] to god that means there's a god in this
[1:24:01] building that wants to give you
[1:24:03] something
[1:24:04] if there's something on the inside that
[1:24:06] wants to get a revelation of this
[1:24:08] message that means there's a revelation
[1:24:10] for you
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:12] if you want healing in your body that
[1:24:15] means there's healing for you
[1:24:17] oh it's a deep calling to the deep what
[1:24:19] a brother branham saying before there
[1:24:21] was a squirrel there was a tree for the
[1:24:23] squirrel to be in before there was a
[1:24:25] fish there was water for that fish to be
[1:24:28] in and before there was a desire
[1:24:30] there was something to satisfy that
[1:24:33] desire
[1:24:35] oh my but underneath the seals was my
[1:24:38] inheritance and then brother branham
[1:24:41] came with that book and he started to
[1:24:43] speak the word spring forth the message
[1:24:45] and now we're come under the message and
[1:24:48] are manifesting the thoughts for this
[1:24:50] last day you know brother branham says
[1:24:53] when moses was under inspiration he said
[1:24:55] let there be flies let there be lives
[1:24:58] let there be frogs he says if it was
[1:25:00] moses's own thoughts that wouldn't have
[1:25:02] come to pass but it was god's thoughts
[1:25:05] so god was obligated to manifest his
[1:25:08] word
[1:25:10] so whenever he said left there'd be
[1:25:11] frogs there had to be frogs because that
[1:25:14] wasn't his thoughts that was god's own
[1:25:17] thoughts
[1:25:18] and oh my but that didn't just you see
[1:25:20] that the power of moses's message wasn't
[1:25:23] just for moses but it was for everybody
[1:25:26] under the message
[1:25:29] i could just i can imagine miriam can
[1:25:32] see the flies come into existence see
[1:25:34] the frogs come into existence see the
[1:25:36] water turned in the blood and she's mine
[1:25:38] that's that's wonderful and all but i'm
[1:25:40] still in bondage
[1:25:42] the message hasn't done nothing for me
[1:25:45] it's working in the prophet oh yeah it's
[1:25:48] working in the preacher aaron but what
[1:25:50] about me
[1:25:51] but then there come a time
[1:25:53] where revelation just wasn't for the
[1:25:55] prophet
[1:25:56] revelation this wasn't for the preacher
[1:25:59] it wasn't just for them but then all of
[1:26:01] a sudden she was on the other side of
[1:26:03] the red sea
[1:26:05] she turned around and seen the message
[1:26:07] in action not just for the prophet not
[1:26:10] just for the preacher but the message
[1:26:12] was an action for her life
[1:26:16] oh the taskmasters for aaron never did
[1:26:19] that's all fired the taskmasters for the
[1:26:21] prophet was dead that's all fine but my
[1:26:24] task masters are dead this morning the
[1:26:27] message ain't just for the prophet ain't
[1:26:30] just for the preacher ain't just for the
[1:26:32] deacons but it's for a young person
[1:26:35] your task masters can be dead this
[1:26:37] morning those complexes can't be
[1:26:39] destroyed this morning
[1:26:42] that anxiety can't be destroyed this
[1:26:44] morning
[1:26:45] the message the authority of the message
[1:26:48] ain't just for the preachers but it's
[1:26:50] for every person under the inspiration
[1:26:53] of the message
[1:26:56] glory to god it's a young person that's
[1:26:59] recognized his day her day and says you
[1:27:02] know what devil this is my time
[1:27:05] but the brandon says the god allotted a
[1:27:07] portions of word throughout the church
[1:27:09] ages
[1:27:11] mary had a portion of where luther had a
[1:27:13] portion of word wesley had a portion of
[1:27:15] work but in this day we don't just got a
[1:27:17] portion of earth we got the fullness of
[1:27:20] the word
[1:27:22] what's that mean by the josh all that
[1:27:24] was in god was in the christ
[1:27:27] all that was in christ is then the bride
[1:27:29] of christ
[1:27:31] you've got the same power
[1:27:33] to say devil get out of my hole
[1:27:35] get out of my life oh remember the
[1:27:37] disciples and jesus walked by the fig
[1:27:39] tree and he cursed the fig tree and they
[1:27:42] walked right by the walk by it again and
[1:27:44] the disciples were marveled and says
[1:27:46] master the fig tree that you cursed is
[1:27:49] withered it's dead but then he didn't
[1:27:52] just keep that power with him but he
[1:27:54] says you're saying to this mountain
[1:27:57] oh you notice he didn't go to the
[1:27:59] scribes and the pharisees and give them
[1:28:02] the authority to speak to the mountain
[1:28:06] they wasn't coming under the message
[1:28:09] oh but the ones under the message oh
[1:28:11] what a peter say where will we go for
[1:28:14] thou hast the words of eternal life with
[1:28:16] that revelation brought a power brought
[1:28:19] in authority the denominations might not
[1:28:22] have the third pole in action but
[1:28:24] there's a bride here in louisiana that
[1:28:27] has the third pull in action in her life
[1:28:30] under the message of the hour
[1:28:33] oh my but you look at miriam her
[1:28:36] revelation brought stimulation how come
[1:28:39] she got so excited she grabbed her
[1:28:42] tambourine and started to dance because
[1:28:44] the message was an action for her life
[1:28:49] oh my the message is an action in our
[1:28:52] life this evening or this morning and we
[1:28:54] got a right to rejoice brother branham
[1:28:57] says that john must have seen his name
[1:29:00] in the book because he started to sing a
[1:29:02] song the book became a new book because
[1:29:05] before he didn't know if his name was
[1:29:07] there or not but then the seals came off
[1:29:10] and that book came came with a total new
[1:29:12] meaning no longer was it a sealed book
[1:29:15] and i'm guessing what it is but now it's
[1:29:18] an open book and i know what it is the
[1:29:21] bible says in revelations 5 13 and every
[1:29:24] creature which is in heaven and on earth
[1:29:26] and under the earth such as in the sea
[1:29:28] and all that are in them hurt i say this
[1:29:31] is somebody that seemed their name in
[1:29:34] the open book heard i sing blessing and
[1:29:36] honor and glory and power be unto him
[1:29:40] that set up on the throne unto the lamb
[1:29:42] forever and ever he wasn't worried about
[1:29:46] what they were thinking he wasn't
[1:29:48] worried about what they said about it he
[1:29:50] was excited because he seen his name
[1:29:53] with the revelation
[1:29:55] oh my you see if i never knew if i had
[1:29:58] never seen a reflection of myself i
[1:30:00] wouldn't know if i had blue eyes or
[1:30:01] brown eyes
[1:30:03] i wouldn't know if i blonde hair a black
[1:30:04] hair so i would just be relying on what
[1:30:08] my parents are telling me they would
[1:30:10] come up and i would ask him dad what
[1:30:12] killer eyes do i got he would say son
[1:30:14] you got brown eyes but i still don't
[1:30:16] know with the revelation
[1:30:18] i'm just taking his word for it
[1:30:21] come on somebody i can say dad what
[1:30:23] color hair do i got you got black hair
[1:30:26] but i'm just taking his word for it so
[1:30:28] somebody could come up to me and say no
[1:30:31] you don't got brown eyes you got blue
[1:30:33] eyes
[1:30:34] and i would say well my dad says i got
[1:30:36] brown eyes
[1:30:37] you catching my drift this morning i'm
[1:30:39] taking somebody else's opinion of who i
[1:30:43] am because i've never seen myself before
[1:30:46] but once i see a reflection i can go to
[1:30:49] that critic and say hey buddy i don't
[1:30:52] got blue eyes i've got brown eyes and
[1:30:55] they would say how do you know because
[1:30:57] i've seen myself in the mirror
[1:31:00] oh man without seeing yourself in the
[1:31:02] book you're just taking what the
[1:31:05] preacher says what mama says what daddy
[1:31:08] says so the devil can come and say your
[1:31:10] serpent's need and since you really
[1:31:12] don't know you're gonna believe it but
[1:31:14] once you see your name in the book you
[1:31:17] can say devil i'm not serpent seed i'm
[1:31:20] not a tribulation saint but i'm the
[1:31:22] virtuous blood washed bride of jesus
[1:31:25] christ
[1:31:26] come on somebody that's why we can
[1:31:28] rejoice that's why we can shout that's
[1:31:31] why we can place god not with an emotion
[1:31:33] but with the revelation of who i am
[1:31:37] i'm not a wannabe i'm not a castaway but
[1:31:40] i'm somebody that god has predestinated
[1:31:44] for this last day
[1:31:47] my wife didn't choose me i chose her
[1:31:51] we didn't choose god god chose us to
[1:31:54] rise in power and cast down every
[1:31:57] imagination god chose you and gave you
[1:32:00] an authority to say devil get behind me
[1:32:05] complexes get behind me anxiety get
[1:32:09] behind me
[1:32:12] and every critic that don't want me to
[1:32:14] praise get behind me
[1:32:17] hey i'm going to worship the lord this
[1:32:19] morning because i know who i am
[1:32:21] [Applause]
[1:32:23] this is the time for worship
[1:32:26] how come
[1:32:27] everybody is worshiping more even the
[1:32:30] baptists are worshiping
[1:32:32] but the bride can't worship
[1:32:37] how come the denominations are allowed
[1:32:38] to worship and they don't even know who
[1:32:40] they are
[1:32:42] and the bride knows who they are but as
[1:32:45] soon as you say glory somebody says hey
[1:32:47] be quiet we're not pentecostal
[1:32:51] who are you
[1:32:52] have you seen yourself in the book
[1:32:54] because i've seen myself in the book and
[1:32:56] i'm getting a little excited because
[1:32:58] while the tribulation's going on i'm out
[1:33:01] of here
[1:33:02] while the earth's on fire i'm out of
[1:33:04] here that's why i can't help but get
[1:33:07] excited
[1:33:09] oh
[1:33:10] my you may lose your mind in the
[1:33:12] tribulation but i'm not losing my mind
[1:33:16] you may lose your family in the
[1:33:18] tribulation but i'm not losing mine you
[1:33:20] may lose your parents in the tribulation
[1:33:23] but i'm not losing mine i know who i am
[1:33:26] and with my identity comes in authority
[1:33:31] oh my when my wife married me
[1:33:33] i don't got much of my bank account but
[1:33:35] what is in my bank account is hers
[1:33:38] so whenever i got under the headship of
[1:33:41] this message
[1:33:43] i'm no longer myself but i'm now missing
[1:33:47] jesus christ and with that identity
[1:33:50] comes in authority
[1:33:52] with that identity comes the dominion
[1:33:55] everything that's god brother branham
[1:33:57] says god will bankrupt heaven before one
[1:34:00] of his words will fall to the ground
[1:34:02] i challenge your faith this morning if
[1:34:04] you need help in your body god's willing
[1:34:07] to bankrupt heaven this morning to give
[1:34:09] you your inheritance
[1:34:11] it's the children's bread
[1:34:14] oh my what's the bible say if if i have
[1:34:18] a son would ask for bread would a father
[1:34:20] give him a stone he says if an earthly
[1:34:22] father won't do that how much more will
[1:34:25] the heavenly father not do that
[1:34:28] is somebody who knows who they are
[1:34:32] oh my look look at luke 10 and 19 behold
[1:34:36] i give unto you power to tread on
[1:34:38] serpents and scorpions and all the power
[1:34:41] of the enemy all the power of the enemy
[1:34:45] then he says nothing shall by any means
[1:34:47] hurt you
[1:34:49] then he stops
[1:34:50] and he says that's all great and all
[1:34:52] that's wonderful notwithstanding in this
[1:34:55] the next verse notwithstanding in this
[1:34:57] rejoice not
[1:34:59] that the spirits are subject unto you
[1:35:01] but rather rejoice because your names
[1:35:05] are written in heaven
[1:35:08] how did they know their names was
[1:35:10] written because jesus just revealed it
[1:35:12] to him
[1:35:13] how do we know oh my how do we know
[1:35:16] where names is written in heaven because
[1:35:18] christ the word the message has revealed
[1:35:21] it to us
[1:35:22] and now the disciples could go on and
[1:35:24] say you know what my name's in heaven
[1:35:26] and somebody could say no it's not oh
[1:35:28] yes it is no it's not yes it is that man
[1:35:31] over there
[1:35:32] the supreme one the anointed word the
[1:35:35] anointed christ not just a christ but
[1:35:39] the christ
[1:35:41] there was many anointed men in that day
[1:35:43] but there was only one the christ that
[1:35:45] was the anointed word for that day he's
[1:35:48] the one that told me my name is in
[1:35:50] heaven he's the one that told me
[1:35:53] i'm engraved in the palm of his hand
[1:35:55] oh and this evening oh this and this
[1:35:57] last day there's the many anointed men
[1:35:59] but there was only one the anointed
[1:36:01] christ that's the message of the hour
[1:36:04] and that's the one who told you he's
[1:36:07] never going to leave you he's never
[1:36:08] going to forsake you but he'll be with
[1:36:10] you to the end of the world
[1:36:12] your name is engraved in the palm of his
[1:36:14] hand y'all started to think about that
[1:36:16] so in order for him to lose your name
[1:36:18] he's got to lose his hand
[1:36:20] and worse has power
[1:36:23] in his hands
[1:36:25] where's the man's strength in his arm so
[1:36:27] in order for him to lose your name
[1:36:30] in order for him to lose your purpose he
[1:36:33] has to lose his strength he has to lose
[1:36:36] his power
[1:36:37] come on somebody and let me give you a
[1:36:39] secret he's never going to lose his
[1:36:41] power he's never going to lose his
[1:36:43] authority so that means he's never going
[1:36:46] to lose you
[1:36:47] he's never going to lose your name
[1:36:49] for your engraved in the palm of his
[1:36:52] hand we've got something to rejoice
[1:36:54] about
[1:36:56] you know we've been commissioned to
[1:36:58] praise god revelations 19 and 5 and a
[1:37:01] voice came out of the throne out of the
[1:37:03] throne saying praise our god
[1:37:05] all ye his servants ye that fear him
[1:37:08] both great and small
[1:37:11] you praise god
[1:37:13] i don't care if you're great i don't
[1:37:15] care if you're small you praise god
[1:37:18] oh my how come david
[1:37:20] got a little excited when the ark of the
[1:37:22] covenant was being returned
[1:37:24] because the word had been lost
[1:37:27] the word was taken away and told you the
[1:37:29] authority of the word but how come the
[1:37:31] word was taken away
[1:37:34] how come the word was taken away because
[1:37:36] the preachers of that day started to put
[1:37:38] their ideas with the word
[1:37:41] the sons of eli were sinning they were
[1:37:44] doing away with the word and because of
[1:37:46] that the bible says
[1:37:48] that god sent a prophet to eli and says
[1:37:51] he's going to strike judgment on his
[1:37:53] house
[1:37:54] and there was going to be death on the
[1:37:56] house of eli how come because they
[1:37:59] started to mix their ideas with the
[1:38:02] words
[1:38:03] but you notice eli's tribe
[1:38:06] god had hand-picked to be the priests
[1:38:09] god had hand-picked them but it was the
[1:38:11] next generations that started to do away
[1:38:14] with the word
[1:38:16] just like wesley came with a message
[1:38:19] but the next generation started to
[1:38:21] denominate and they died the baptist the
[1:38:24] methodist they're all dead then there
[1:38:26] rose up another one with the word of god
[1:38:29] but the next generations started to
[1:38:31] denominate
[1:38:32] and so the word has been lost in creeds
[1:38:35] and in dogmas but you notice the word
[1:38:38] hasn't lost its power it just lost its
[1:38:40] power in their
[1:38:42] life what happened the philistines came
[1:38:45] into the camp of israel and started
[1:38:47] slaying all the men slang the warriors
[1:38:49] and it was the eli sons that says let us
[1:38:52] get the ark of the covenant and it will
[1:38:54] save us
[1:38:56] man they thought the word had authority
[1:38:58] they thought it had power and it did but
[1:39:00] not in their life because they took
[1:39:02] their own ideas
[1:39:04] oh we got too many message people coming
[1:39:07] to church and saying why ain't god
[1:39:08] working for me
[1:39:10] how come this message ain't working for
[1:39:11] me are you mixing your ideas with the
[1:39:13] message
[1:39:15] come on somebody are you mixing what you
[1:39:18] think is right with the message that's
[1:39:20] not gonna produce an authority but the
[1:39:22] fullness of the word the pure
[1:39:24] unadulterated word is going to produce
[1:39:27] an authority and we know what happened
[1:39:30] they got the ark of the covenant and the
[1:39:32] philistines came and destroyed them they
[1:39:34] wrote dead and they took the ark of the
[1:39:36] covenant back to their camp
[1:39:38] but the word of the lord didn't lose his
[1:39:40] authority because what happened they put
[1:39:43] it before the god dakin the next morning
[1:39:45] they got up and that god was falling
[1:39:47] down before the ark of the uh before the
[1:39:49] ark of the covenant so the word of the
[1:39:52] lord did not lose its authority it still
[1:39:54] had its power
[1:39:56] what happened they stood it back up the
[1:39:58] next morning they got out and they are
[1:40:00] the palms were cut off
[1:40:02] the head was cut off it was nothing but
[1:40:04] a stop laying there
[1:40:06] that's what the word will do
[1:40:08] when you give a full preeminence in your
[1:40:10] life
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:12] oh
[1:40:13] come on somebody that's what the word
[1:40:16] will do when you push out what you think
[1:40:18] is right and embrace what god knows is
[1:40:21] right then every devil that comes
[1:40:23] against you will be a stump
[1:40:27] his head will be cut off his hands will
[1:40:29] be cut off it will be crushed that's
[1:40:32] what the authority of the word will do
[1:40:35] in your life
[1:40:37] so what happened
[1:40:38] the rock of the lord was being returned
[1:40:41] it was time for the walk to be restored
[1:40:44] and david
[1:40:45] looked down the road
[1:40:46] and he sent me art coming he goes my
[1:40:49] this is the one i heard about
[1:40:51] this is the one i heard mama tell me
[1:40:53] stories about with moses and joshua and
[1:40:56] this one and that one i heard these
[1:40:58] stories of old but
[1:41:01] is that coming down the road what is
[1:41:02] then all of a sudden revelation kicked
[1:41:04] in this is the one i heard about
[1:41:07] not just for the ones in the past but
[1:41:10] it's for me today and he started to
[1:41:12] rejoice he started to shout because the
[1:41:15] word the authority was restored in his
[1:41:17] life
[1:41:18] and we know what happened his wife
[1:41:20] started to criticize him and what
[1:41:22] happened her womb was shut up
[1:41:24] there was no life she was barren
[1:41:27] you better watch out when you start to
[1:41:29] criticize life
[1:41:31] once you start criticizing life you may
[1:41:33] lose life
[1:41:35] come on somebody but when david knew
[1:41:38] that that wasn't death coming down the
[1:41:40] road that was life coming down the road
[1:41:43] and the shame that this morning we don't
[1:41:45] got death the denominations are in death
[1:41:48] you notice eli's tribe was still dead
[1:41:52] they were still dead but david wasn't
[1:41:54] dead he was alive
[1:41:56] because the earth was being restored to
[1:41:58] the camp of israel and in this last day
[1:42:01] the denominations are dead but the earth
[1:42:03] the word of god has been restored to the
[1:42:06] camp of the bride
[1:42:08] you can rise up in authority and say no
[1:42:11] devil i've got a power i've got an
[1:42:14] authority the possessor has been equated
[1:42:17] with me but random says you know god
[1:42:19] looked down out of heaven and said david
[1:42:21] you're a man after mine own hearts you
[1:42:24] know god looked down out of heaven and
[1:42:25] said you're a man after mine our hearts
[1:42:27] see why he done lost all of his pride
[1:42:30] lost all of us yet he was married to a
[1:42:33] king's daughter but he wasn't even
[1:42:35] considering it then he knowed that he
[1:42:38] was equated with the possessor of the
[1:42:40] heavens and earth
[1:42:42] what brought them together what
[1:42:44] acquainted him with the possessor of
[1:42:46] heavens and earth the ark of the
[1:42:47] covenant
[1:42:50] come on somebody that's why he could
[1:42:52] rejoice because he was brought back to
[1:42:55] the world to the lord because of the ark
[1:42:58] and why can we rejoice because we've
[1:43:00] been equated back with the possessor of
[1:43:03] heavens and earth because of this
[1:43:05] message
[1:43:06] [Applause]
[1:43:07] oh my and now it's being produced in our
[1:43:10] life you know the scribes and the
[1:43:12] pharisees asked for a sign and jesus
[1:43:14] said i'll give you a sign for as jonah
[1:43:17] was in the belly of the well for three
[1:43:19] days so will the son of man be in the
[1:43:21] earth for three days so whenever he died
[1:43:24] and was in the grave we know that his
[1:43:26] body had died but his spirit was alive
[1:43:30] so in order for the world to know that
[1:43:33] the spirit was alive the body had to
[1:43:35] raise up
[1:43:38] i'm preaching this morning amen because
[1:43:40] we know the spirit of the bible brother
[1:43:42] branham says that his spirit went to
[1:43:44] hell and preached the souls he went to
[1:43:46] paradise so god was alive still but the
[1:43:49] body was dead so in order to manifest
[1:43:52] his power on earth the body had to raise
[1:43:55] up
[1:43:56] so the spirit of god has been on the
[1:43:58] earth but in order for the world to know
[1:44:01] that he's on earth the body
[1:44:04] has to rise up to the occasion
[1:44:06] and say i'm going to produce the word
[1:44:09] for this thing did you notice how
[1:44:12] powerful the spirit was in the body of
[1:44:14] christ that even the ones that killed
[1:44:17] the body of christ how to realize he
[1:44:20] rose from the dead
[1:44:23] the ones that crucified him how to
[1:44:26] realize hey prophecy is being fulfilled
[1:44:29] i put this man in the grave but now he's
[1:44:32] alive because they came and they told
[1:44:35] the soldiers hey tell a fear
[1:44:37] you tell them that the disciples come
[1:44:39] and stole their body why would they say
[1:44:41] that
[1:44:42] if they didn't know he was alive
[1:44:45] even the critics know there's the god on
[1:44:48] earth
[1:44:49] the devil knows that there's a god on
[1:44:51] earth the demon knows there's a god on
[1:44:54] earth how come the body's alive
[1:44:58] the body is producing the words
[1:45:05] you notice when the body died it died
[1:45:07] with power when it rose up it came up
[1:45:09] with power
[1:45:11] the book of the first church went down
[1:45:13] with power
[1:45:15] the first bride went down with power but
[1:45:17] this last bride
[1:45:19] has rose up with the same power
[1:45:22] promote somebody the miracles ain't just
[1:45:25] for the book of acts
[1:45:27] the day the signs and wonders just for
[1:45:29] the book of acts but it's for the bride
[1:45:32] in this last day
[1:45:33] and the devil knows something
[1:45:35] supernatural is taking place
[1:45:39] how come he's fighting you and not the
[1:45:41] denominations because he knows
[1:45:44] something's going on it's out of the
[1:45:46] tomb
[1:45:48] you may have been dead in your sins but
[1:45:51] he wanted to keep you dead in your sins
[1:45:53] but this morning let me announce to the
[1:45:56] devil the stone has been rolled away the
[1:45:59] bride of christ is out of the tomb with
[1:46:02] the same power the same authority the
[1:46:04] same dominion and i say this morning
[1:46:07] devil be careful
[1:46:09] there's a powerhouse on earth that's
[1:46:12] destroying every stronghold destroying
[1:46:14] every chain destroying everything that
[1:46:17] comes against her not only is she
[1:46:19] destroying the devil but she's dancing
[1:46:21] over your head
[1:46:24] come on somebody the devil knows
[1:46:27] that he can't keep you from destroying
[1:46:29] him but what he would do was keep you
[1:46:32] hack take away your joy while destroying
[1:46:35] him

[1:47:23] left a trial magnify the power that was
[1:47:27] on the inside of their life
[1:47:28] they started praising god that authority
[1:47:31] didn't leave them in the trial
[1:47:35] oh they needed the offen they needed the
[1:47:37] trial to express the authority because
[1:47:40] as they started to praise god the prison
[1:47:43] bar started to break the wall started to
[1:47:45] fall down those bars started to break
[1:47:48] what was it they knew there was a power
[1:47:50] on the inside and that power wasn't

[1:48:00] challenge you this morning don't lose
[1:48:02] your praise in the trial don't lose your

[1:48:08] watch god take that circumstance and
[1:48:11] turn it for a testimony
[1:48:13] hey we like the testimonies but we don't
[1:48:15] like the test that comes to the
[1:48:17] testimony
[1:48:18] but it takes the test to give the
[1:48:20] testimony
[1:48:22] oh
[1:48:23] my i hope this is okay this morning
[1:48:26] but the brandon says when truth is
[1:48:27] revealed truth is vindicated
[1:48:30] oh my
[1:48:31] we got the truth revealed in this last
[1:48:33] day and now it's being vindicated in our
[1:48:36] lives we're no longer looking for
[1:48:39] something to come but we know it's here
[1:48:42] you look at the woman at the well she
[1:48:44] was looking for something to come she
[1:48:46] was looking for one to come and express
[1:48:49] this authority what happened jesus came
[1:48:51] directly at the well started to read her
[1:48:53] life and she stopped and she says i
[1:48:55] perceive you a prophet
[1:48:57] i perceive when the messiah comes he
[1:49:00] will do these things
[1:49:01] and he stopped and he says
[1:49:04] this is somebody
[1:49:05] that knows
[1:49:07] something's going to come
[1:49:09] she's expecting the word to be here
[1:49:13] and he stopped and he said i am he
[1:49:16] she no longer was looking for him to
[1:49:18] come
[1:49:19] she knew he was here
[1:49:22] but you notice what she said what her
[1:49:24] testimony was she ran away and said come
[1:49:27] see a man who told me all i ever done
[1:49:32] ain't this the messiah ain't this the
[1:49:35] christ
[1:49:36] so the anointed one she was waiting on
[1:49:39] she was waiting for these signs waiting
[1:49:41] for these wonders the signs and wonders
[1:49:44] she was waiting on was being manifested
[1:49:46] through her life
[1:49:49] did you catch that because she said come
[1:49:51] see a man who told me so the things
[1:49:53] we're waiting on is being revealed
[1:49:55] through me
[1:49:56] the message that we've been waiting on
[1:49:58] is here and the authority is being
[1:50:00] revealed through the bride
[1:50:03] the bible says that many of the men
[1:50:05] believed on christ because of her
[1:50:08] testimony
[1:50:09] oh my and brother branham would say but
[1:50:11] the men couldn't even be around her what
[1:50:14] made the difference the influence of
[1:50:16] christ changed her where no longer was
[1:50:19] the men the women running from her there
[1:50:21] was something that she had that they
[1:50:24] wanted
[1:50:26] oh my you want to get your family member
[1:50:28] saved give them the message
[1:50:30] and let the message come on the inside
[1:50:32] and start to influencing you
[1:50:35] they're no longer human gloom all the
[1:50:37] time no longer you in the dumps all the
[1:50:39] time but you've got something bubbling
[1:50:41] up now it's a it's a well it's a spring
[1:50:44] of living water that the world wants
[1:50:47] hey the word wants something genuine
[1:50:49] they don't want to put on they want they
[1:50:51] don't want something fake the world is
[1:50:53] looking for a living god and this
[1:50:56] message has brought a living god in our
[1:50:58] midst not just in our midst but on the
[1:51:01] inside we're producing the living god
[1:51:05] you know brother branham would say that
[1:51:07] them in the upper room the reason they
[1:51:09] got excited was because the prophecy for
[1:51:12] that day was being revealed through them
[1:51:14] that's why they came out staggering like
[1:51:16] drunk men because the prophecies for
[1:51:19] that day was being revealed through them
[1:51:21] but the brandon was saved
[1:51:22] here it is god's vindicated revelation
[1:51:26] made plain to them they was happy about
[1:51:28] it god promised it here it was revealed
[1:51:31] to them and vindicated to them amen here
[1:51:34] is a man saying they're saying this is
[1:51:36] that this is that and there it was being
[1:51:39] vindicated by the same signs their
[1:51:43] stimulation by revelation they really
[1:51:45] had it then the reason why they were so
[1:51:48] excited because the revelation kicked in
[1:51:51] that this is the day for prophecy to be
[1:51:54] fulfilled you know brother branham would
[1:51:56] say that revelation brings satisfaction
[1:51:59] so once you get sadder once you to see a
[1:52:01] revelation of this message you're no
[1:52:04] look you're no longer looking for
[1:52:06] something to come but now you're
[1:52:08] satisfied with what god has right here
[1:52:11] with us
[1:52:12] you see too many people is not satisfied
[1:52:14] with what god has given that's why
[1:52:16] they're constantly looking
[1:52:18] they're constantly looking for something
[1:52:21] more
[1:52:24] that's why
[1:52:25] that's why many many girls put on makeup
[1:52:28] [Applause]
[1:52:30] because they're not satisfied with
[1:52:32] what's been given
[1:52:34] they think they're going to change their
[1:52:36] identity
[1:52:38] oh my here we go that's why many boys
[1:52:41] think they got to fit in with the world
[1:52:43] they're not satisfied with the identity
[1:52:46] that the message has brought
[1:52:49] i'm preaching this morning they're
[1:52:50] constantly looking for something to
[1:52:53] fulfill them
[1:52:54] because their curse hasn't been
[1:52:56] satisfied but you ever get a revelation
[1:52:59] of this a message you're no longer
[1:53:02] looking for an identity but you have
[1:53:04] found an identity
[1:53:07] oh am i in order
[1:53:10] in order for you to accept another
[1:53:12] identity you got to push away your
[1:53:14] identity
[1:53:17] oh so in order for you you girls to put
[1:53:20] on pants and put on makeup and cut your
[1:53:22] hair and go out into the world you got
[1:53:24] to push away the identity that the
[1:53:26] message brought
[1:53:28] and embrace an identity that the devil
[1:53:30] wants to give you
[1:53:32] but this morning your identity and
[1:53:35] serpentine your identity is the bride of
[1:53:38] jesus christ
[1:53:39] [Applause]
[1:53:41] that was free
[1:53:44] brother branham says it brought such a
[1:53:45] positive to them that nearly every one
[1:53:48] of them sealed their testimonies talking
[1:53:50] about the 120 in the upper room silver
[1:53:52] testimony with their blood no matter
[1:53:54] what came along as long as they lived
[1:53:57] they never got over it it stayed there
[1:53:59] because it was the true word of promise
[1:54:01] vindicated the revelation become
[1:54:04] vindicated they died stealing their
[1:54:06] testimony with their own blood now look
[1:54:09] look at the promise of this last day
[1:54:11] here we see it vindicated right before
[1:54:14] us the present coming of the holy spirit
[1:54:17] and the works he was supposed to do is
[1:54:20] right among us oh my now can you hear it
[1:54:23] something is taking place i tell you
[1:54:26] friend when a true sincere predestinated
[1:54:28] believer when light strikes upon that
[1:54:31] seed something bursts forth to a new
[1:54:34] life
[1:54:35] something's taken place
[1:54:37] something is happening on the inside of
[1:54:39] the bride it's a revelation
[1:54:42] she's realizing
[1:54:44] that there's a body on earth and on that
[1:54:46] body that's proclaiming the actions of
[1:54:49] jesus christ what did what did jesus
[1:54:52] tell the john's disciples when he came
[1:54:54] they came up to him and says are we to
[1:54:56] are you the christ are we to look for
[1:54:58] one to come and he said he said go tell
[1:55:01] john what you see and what you hear the
[1:55:04] blind receive their sight the lame walk
[1:55:06] the lepers are cleansed and the deaf
[1:55:08] hear the death are raised the dead are
[1:55:10] raised the poor have the gospel preached
[1:55:12] to them so the man or the the the
[1:55:15] vindication to john the christ was on
[1:55:18] earth was his signs
[1:55:20] was the body proclaiming that he was
[1:55:22] alive and the revelation of the
[1:55:25] vindication that god is on earth is the
[1:55:28] bride manifesting the signs but brother
[1:55:31] branham would say when the bride would
[1:55:33] get back to a word pride she will
[1:55:35] produce the very works that jesus
[1:55:38] produced that there is somebody that is
[1:55:41] the body of christ producing the same
[1:55:44] actions john 14 to 12 verily verily i
[1:55:48] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:55:50] works that i do shall he do also and the
[1:55:54] works and greater works than thee shall
[1:55:56] he do because i go unto my father
[1:55:59] brother branham would say there's always
[1:56:01] a witness on earth there's always a body
[1:56:04] that's witnessed the power of christ so
[1:56:07] christ is saying here i'm a witness of
[1:56:09] the power of god i'm going off the scene
[1:56:12] but the power is not leaving you're not
[1:56:15] going to be my witnesses you're not
[1:56:17] going to proclaim that god is alive and
[1:56:20] well i believe god is still online in
[1:56:22] action in this last day but the brandon
[1:56:24] would say in action god in action oh i
[1:56:27] love that not some idol not some
[1:56:29] mythical thought of rubbing a statue but
[1:56:32] a real living god in action not
[1:56:35] something that was but something that is
[1:56:38] right now that's what god wants to do is
[1:56:41] take fallen humanity and whip up on the
[1:56:43] devil with him when it looks like you're
[1:56:46] defeated when it looks like the devil's
[1:56:47] got the upper hand that's when god likes
[1:56:50] to display his power oh my you know you
[1:56:53] look at the when when jesus took the
[1:56:56] little boy's lunch this was jesus the
[1:56:59] one that spoke let there be light that
[1:57:01] spoke the the creative word he could
[1:57:03] have spoke fish and bread right there to
[1:57:05] feed the thousands of people but he
[1:57:07] wanted to take a little boy who had
[1:57:10] nothing and manifest his power through
[1:57:13] oh the dead god can be here today
[1:57:16] whipping up on the devil like he did
[1:57:18] back when christ was on earth but he
[1:57:20] wants to take somebody
[1:57:22] that can't do it in themselves and
[1:57:24] reveal this power through
[1:57:26] oh
[1:57:27] my you know i know there's some sports
[1:57:29] players in here you know it drives a
[1:57:32] sports player nuts when you got the
[1:57:34] better team
[1:57:35] you know that you got the better players
[1:57:38] you got the better ball handling skills
[1:57:40] the better shooters and these little
[1:57:42] dweebs comes and beats you
[1:57:44] and you're like oh geez
[1:57:46] that just that just like that takes your
[1:57:48] man card away you're like man how did
[1:57:50] that even happen that's what's happening
[1:57:52] in this last day
[1:57:54] the devil's got the upper hand you can't
[1:57:56] beat him in your own but god is taking
[1:57:58] some nobodies that's got no ability god
[1:58:02] no power got no authority and expressing
[1:58:05] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:58:08] forever through your life and the
[1:58:10] devil's setting they're speechless
[1:58:12] saying i've done all that i can do and i
[1:58:15] can't get them defeated that's right
[1:58:17] devil that's because the bride of christ
[1:58:20] has the power of christ through her
[1:58:23] oh let me let me tell the devil
[1:58:25] something he can try and try and try but
[1:58:28] brother branham says the first he failed
[1:58:31] but the second even is not going fall
[1:58:33] that's a prophecy that you're gonna
[1:58:36] fulfill in your life
[1:58:38] he may try to come with doubts come with
[1:58:40] skeptics cometh unbelief but there's
[1:58:42] something on the inside that's embraced
[1:58:45] the message of the hour and now it's
[1:58:47] being manifested through your life i
[1:58:50] believe god has power to hold young
[1:58:53] people i believe god's got power to keep
[1:58:55] our marriage together i believe god's
[1:58:57] got power to rise up a daddy and a mama
[1:59:00] that's not wishy washy but it's on fire
[1:59:03] with the holy ghost i believe that power
[1:59:06] is on earth we don't got to be make
[1:59:08] believers we don't got to be lukewarm
[1:59:10] christians we don't got to be formal but
[1:59:12] i believe that the bride of christ is to
[1:59:14] be on fire to be with power and
[1:59:17] demonstration and the message has
[1:59:20] brought that down so that you can
[1:59:22] manifest it oh that's why there's a
[1:59:24] group of young people when the other
[1:59:26] one's around smoking they're out and
[1:59:28] drinking they're in pornography there's
[1:59:30] some young people that's not out
[1:59:31] defiling their life because something's
[1:59:34] taken place on the inside and now we're
[1:59:37] manifesting the word but the branham
[1:59:39] says but we've done everything else
[1:59:41] besides that go ye into all the world
[1:59:44] and preach the gospel what what what's
[1:59:46] the gospel not word only but through
[1:59:48] power and demonstration of the holy
[1:59:51] ghost making the word of god manifest is
[1:59:55] the gospel
[1:59:57] oh my brother branham would say that the
[1:59:59] greatest sermon ever preached is the
[2:00:01] life being lived
[2:00:03] is the life being lived something's
[2:00:05] taken place and now you're showing the
[2:00:07] world you may not got something but i do
[2:00:10] got something how come david had
[2:00:12] confidence to come against goliath hope
[2:00:14] this is okay this morning david had a
[2:00:16] back he had a he was anointed with oil
[2:00:19] number one we know what happened the
[2:00:21] prophet came and anointed him with oil
[2:00:23] which is a type of a holy ghost so
[2:00:25] that's the type of the holy ghost but
[2:00:28] that they didn't just stop there then
[2:00:30] the prophet told him he was going to be
[2:00:32] king
[2:00:32] so now he got a message telling him what
[2:00:35] he was going to do
[2:00:37] and then that produced the produce of
[2:00:40] vindica his life started to produce a
[2:00:43] vindication of what he had the bear came
[2:00:46] against him the lion came against him
[2:00:48] but they couldn't destroy him because he
[2:00:50] was anointed with oil he had the wine he
[2:00:53] had the oil and then he had a message
[2:00:56] the toading he was the reign as king
[2:00:58] so it didn't matter what come against
[2:01:00] him his life was just vindicating the
[2:01:04] message that he got
[2:01:06] so whenever he came against goliath he
[2:01:08] wasn't afraid
[2:01:10] he was bold he was fearless how come his
[2:01:13] brothers were hiding in the caves hiding
[2:01:16] behind the rocks hiding in their tents
[2:01:18] because they didn't know if they were
[2:01:20] going to die or not
[2:01:23] they didn't know they didn't have a
[2:01:24] message come and tell them they were
[2:01:26] going to be king
[2:01:28] but david knew he couldn't die because
[2:01:30] he had something to fulfill
[2:01:33] you can't be destroyed this morning
[2:01:35] because you've got something to fulfill
[2:01:38] you've got a rapture to make
[2:01:40] you've got prophecies in this last day
[2:01:43] to make manifest
[2:01:45] oh my so when david came up against
[2:01:48] goliath he said you may got a sword you
[2:01:51] may got a shield you come in the name of
[2:01:53] a philistine but i come in the name of
[2:01:55] the lord
[2:01:56] i'm anointed with loyal i had a message
[2:01:59] tell me my future and i don't care what
[2:02:01] the present state is i know my future
[2:02:05] and whenever you know you're present or
[2:02:06] whenever you know your future the
[2:02:08] present circumstances don't bother you
[2:02:12] when you know what's going to happen
[2:02:13] tomorrow your present circumstances
[2:02:15] don't bother you but if you don't know
[2:02:18] what's going to happen tomorrow today's
[2:02:20] going to worry
[2:02:22] oh but we got a message that took us
[2:02:25] back in the back in the future before
[2:02:27] time is through the thoughts of god into
[2:02:30] the mind of god the same message brought
[2:02:32] us to present day but that message
[2:02:34] didn't just stop at present day but that
[2:02:38] message went into the future
[2:02:40] we know our future this morning that's
[2:02:43] why we don't got to be in the dumps
[2:02:46] hey i heard a story one time hope this
[2:02:48] is okay heard a story mark lowry anybody
[2:02:51] knows the comedian mark lowry
[2:02:53] oh boy

[2:02:58] got my attention he says i survived the
[2:03:00] tornado

[2:03:12] ship was going back and forth
[2:03:14] and he was scared to death he thought he
[2:03:16] was going to die and by the time it was

[2:03:37] says this happens all the time and he
[2:03:39] made a statement he says if i knew i was
[2:03:41] going to survive it would have been fun
[2:03:43] for me too
[2:03:45] we know we're going to survive this last
[2:03:48] day so rejoice in the child rejoice in
[2:03:51] the hard times we're stimulated by the
[2:03:54] revelation of our future you're not
[2:03:57] going down you're going up

[2:04:01] defeated but you're going to rise up in
[2:04:03] power and turn off goliath's head

[2:04:08] future has been known to you

[2:04:27] this one's going this way
[2:04:29] that one's going to that way like my it
[2:04:31] can get overwhelming because there's
[2:04:33] tons of screens tons of different
[2:04:36] destinations but i was only looking for
[2:04:38] one destination
[2:04:40] i didn't care who was going to egypt
[2:04:42] that wasn't for me
[2:04:43] i don't care who was going to hong kong
[2:04:47] that didn't bother me i was coming back
[2:04:49] to where i came from and since i was
[2:04:53] here before i was there there was
[2:04:55] something drawing me to come back where
[2:04:57] i came from and i was going to find a
[2:05:00] way to get back here
[2:05:02] oh
[2:05:03] my but we didn't we didn't find the way
[2:05:05] to get back to the mind of god god gave
[2:05:08] us a way to get back to where we came
[2:05:10] from the tribulation ain't concerning us
[2:05:14] it's not for me
[2:05:16] helling for me these other things ain't
[2:05:18] for me there's only one plane that's for
[2:05:21] me that's a rapture that's a body change
[2:05:24] so i don't care what this one's doing
[2:05:26] what that one's doing my future is
[2:05:29] already in concrete i'm going back to
[2:05:32] where i came from oh you notice before i
[2:05:36] was ever in england i already had a
[2:05:38] ticket back here
[2:05:40] and before we ever came from the mind of
[2:05:42] god to this present day god already gave
[2:05:45] a ticket come on somebody god already
[2:05:48] gave a ticket for you to go back
[2:05:51] [Applause]
[2:05:53] his thoughts are eternal so before the
[2:05:56] earth was ever created his thoughts were
[2:05:58] now let me tell you something his
[2:06:00] thoughts never change so whenever you
[2:06:02] was in sin you was in addictions you was
[2:06:05] in pornography his thoughts towards you
[2:06:08] never changed and i don't care what you
[2:06:11] go through his thoughts are never going
[2:06:13] to change
[2:06:15] oh you noticed david
[2:06:17] david was chased by saul but that still
[2:06:20] didn't change his future
[2:06:22] he was chased by a lion and a bear that
[2:06:24] still didn't change his future
[2:06:26] the goliath came against him but that
[2:06:28] still to change his future and let me
[2:06:31] say this what david did himself never
[2:06:34] changed his future
[2:06:36] and i don't care what you go through
[2:06:38] what you may do it's never going to
[2:06:40] change your future
[2:06:42] oh you look how you see god's so
[2:06:44] determined to make sure that your future
[2:06:48] ain't going to be messed up you notice
[2:06:50] uh samuel whenever he was going to
[2:06:52] anoint david he went up to all his other
[2:06:54] brothers he said oh this is the king
[2:06:57] this is the predestinator this is the
[2:06:59] one and god will say oh no
[2:07:02] not even the prophet can mess up his
[2:07:04] future
[2:07:05] [Applause]
[2:07:06] i don't think you caught it not even the
[2:07:09] prophet
[2:07:10] could mess up david's future and let me
[2:07:13] say our prophet tried killing himself
[2:07:16] try shooting himself trying to grab that
[2:07:18] wire but not even our prophet
[2:07:20] could mess up your future
[2:07:23] come on somebody god wanted to make sure
[2:07:26] that there was a bride with the spot
[2:07:29] with that wrinkle
[2:07:30] without any such blemish make a rapture
[2:07:33] and the only way that was to happen was
[2:07:35] for there to be a message so god got a
[2:07:37] messenger brother branham says that god
[2:07:40] got the perfect man with the perfect
[2:07:42] nature to match the perfect message for
[2:07:45] you
[2:07:47] oh my we think we think that the message
[2:07:49] is too important for us oh my i'm a
[2:07:52] young person and the message is only for
[2:07:54] the preachers only for the parents
[2:07:56] that's not true the message is for young
[2:07:58] people
[2:08:00] just like it is for the adults
[2:08:05] but not even the prophet can mess up
[2:08:07] your future
[2:08:08] and so what makes you think you can mess
[2:08:10] up your future
[2:08:12] now now many people take predestination
[2:08:14] as a crutch as a license to sin
[2:08:17] that's not what i'm talking about
[2:08:19] predestination need to push you away
[2:08:21] from god predestination draws you to god
[2:08:27] hallelujah so whenever you know
[2:08:30] whenever you know your future
[2:08:32] you know what's not your future
[2:08:34] when you know your identity you know
[2:08:36] what's not your identity so whenever the
[2:08:39] devil comes and says oh no you're not
[2:08:40] going to make a rapture you say oh no i
[2:08:42] know my future
[2:08:43] oh no i know who i am
[2:08:45] and god's not going to leave us here all
[2:08:47] by yourself he's going to make sure our
[2:08:49] future comes to pass you see i was in
[2:08:52] poland with uncle jonathan one time and
[2:08:54] our airline went on strike
[2:08:56] that's a terrible feeling whenever
[2:08:59] you're all the way across the ocean
[2:09:02] you're ready to go home it's the last
[2:09:04] day
[2:09:05] the next morning you're getting on a
[2:09:06] plane to come home
[2:09:08] and you get an alert that the airline
[2:09:10] went on strike you got no plane ticket
[2:09:12] you're stuck there
[2:09:14] that's a terrible feeling but that's not
[2:09:16] a feeling the bride's got
[2:09:18] god's not going to say oh no this is too
[2:09:21] hard i'm cancelling your ticket now he's
[2:09:23] got enough power to make sure he don't
[2:09:26] care if the devil's against you if
[2:09:28] circumstances against you trials is
[2:09:30] against you he's going to make sure that
[2:09:32] your ticket is good and valid and you're
[2:09:35] going to step into that body change one
[2:09:37] day and laugh at the devil and say devil
[2:09:40] you thought you had me but my future is
[2:09:43] greater than the present circumstances
[2:09:47] hallelujah our future is greater as the
[2:09:50] musicians come
[2:09:51] our future is greater than the
[2:09:54] than the present circumstances and i
[2:09:56] don't care what i go through
[2:09:58] devil
[2:09:59] you can't do it you can't destroy me
[2:10:02] oh my
[2:10:05] brother branham would say when the truth
[2:10:07] when the truth of a promised word of god
[2:10:09] has been truly revealed to his saints
[2:10:11] that's filled with oil they get all
[2:10:13] stimulated wine of stimulation glory i
[2:10:17] feel it right now
[2:10:18] stimulated with joy with shouts
[2:10:21] when it does it has the same effect upon
[2:10:23] them that the natural wine does
[2:10:26] because when revelation has been given
[2:10:28] has been given of a truth of god and the
[2:10:30] true believer filled with oil the
[2:10:32] revelation is revealed the stimulation
[2:10:35] becomes so great that makes him beside
[2:10:37] himself unnormally
[2:10:39] that's why the world thinks you're crazy
[2:10:42] because the normal to them is something
[2:10:44] completely different than what god's
[2:10:46] normal is but this bride is producing
[2:10:49] god's norm
[2:10:50] amen can you just play something can you
[2:10:52] play that can't you see why i'm happy
[2:10:54] let's just bow our heads tonight
