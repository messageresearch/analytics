[23:23] pray for these needs
[23:25] [Music]
[23:27] amen we're going to go to prayer here in
[23:30] just a moment
[23:32] my way thank god for all he's done for
[23:34] us
[23:36] amen i want to ask one more request as
[23:38] we
[23:39] go to prayer this morning and that is
[23:42] that the lord will send a revival to
[23:44] every church
[23:45] in the bride across the world amen that
[23:48] they'll just be a part of what god's
[23:50] doing in this environment
[23:52] amen but the holy spirit is just moving
[23:56] their lives and their hearts
[23:58] bring deliverance healing salvation
[24:02] amen let the work of grace go for
[24:06] amen i want to share with you a little
[24:08] quote here on this
[24:10] easter morning this is zero hour
[24:13] amen this is a moment of time that we
[24:16] have been
[24:17] called to listen to these words here
[24:21] and the preachers of that day had to
[24:24] give an answer for this stir
[24:27] because it was at the feast of passover
[24:30] and they screamed out
[24:31] who is this maybe some people are
[24:34] wondering who is this
[24:36] what is this what is this that's moving
[24:39] what
[24:39] who is this that's coming among god's
[24:42] people and causing such a stern
[24:44] amen the anointing of the holy ghost
[24:46] coming down
[24:47] and delivering lives and setting people
[24:50] free
[24:51] who is this among us
[24:54] and the air was charged and the coming
[24:57] of the lord jesus
[24:58] to jerusalem had charged the air with
[25:01] expectations
[25:03] and it looked like the teachers ought to
[25:05] know what was going to take place
[25:08] it looked like that the high priest
[25:10] would have noted
[25:11] it looked like that all the other
[25:13] priests would have known it
[25:15] and it hasn't changed any today because
[25:18] the holy spirit is forerunning the
[25:20] coming of the lord jesus
[25:22] and as the holy spirit begins to stretch
[25:24] out across the earth
[25:26] revival fires are broken out everywhere
[25:29] great signs and wonders has been done
[25:32] healings has took place prophecies have
[25:35] went forth
[25:36] and all the gathering of the apostolic
[25:38] blessings has come back to the church
[25:40] again
[25:41] so as it was then so is it now the
[25:44] spirit of the unbeliever still cries out
[25:47] who is this well i'll tell you that who
[25:49] it is
[25:50] it's the same pillar of fire that
[25:53] appeared in the burning bush
[25:55] it's the same pillar of fire amen that
[25:58] anointed jesus
[25:59] and came and dwelt in him it is the i am
[26:02] that it
[26:03] is that i am it is the same pillar of
[26:06] fire that
[26:07] sent a prophet in this day and is
[26:09] leading the church
[26:10] and is here among us today jesus christ
[26:13] is saying yesterday today and forever
[26:16] i got the answer as to who this is
[26:19] amen and he can put a fire in your life
[26:22] that the devil can never put out
[26:25] amen amen let's talk to the lord now
[26:29] father we're your children today
[26:33] we come under the charge and the
[26:35] authority of the holy ghost

[26:46] stands by your word you send out healing
[26:50] and deliverance
[26:52] you send out salvation and your glory
[26:56] has arisen upon us and we're here in a
[26:59] day in the hour where the hour is
[27:01] charged with expectations we're seeing

[27:06] we've seen you move in our midst we've
[27:09] seen demons have to obey the name of
[27:11] jesus christ
[27:12] and fall at your feet subdued we have
[27:16] seen the holy spirit go forth and bring
[27:19] healeth
[27:20] oh as the son of righteousness arises
[27:22] with healing in his wings
[27:25] we have seen lord the great resurrection
[27:28] signs as lives of him and chains of
[27:30] darkness and delight
[27:32] and we're just asking god that you'll
[27:34] continue
[27:35] to let that sun rise as it's risen
[27:38] even today in the glorious sunlight

[1:09:44] christ we pray
[1:09:46] amen amen if you're turning your bibles
[1:09:50] to the book of hebrews the 12th chapter
[1:09:54] amen hasn't it been a wonderful time
[1:09:59] that was a little weak amen
[1:10:03] you know jesus has been passing by and
[1:10:04] we say amen
[1:10:07] i think it's been wonderful
[1:10:11] and i i tell you the power that has been
[1:10:14] in these meetings
[1:10:16] if our president was here he'd be able
[1:10:18] to talk right
[1:10:20] for vice president here and make her a
[1:10:22] lady
[1:10:24] i mean the power that is here aiming to
[1:10:27] change
[1:10:27] lives forever
[1:10:30] we can't take these moments lightly
[1:10:34] amen what a precious time it is i just
[1:10:37] want to
[1:10:37] tell brother tim thank you for the
[1:10:39] privilege of being here and we certainly
[1:10:41] have appreciated your ministry for all
[1:10:44] the years and the friendship that you
[1:10:45] provided and
[1:10:47] and the camps that you've had for our
[1:10:48] young people have many
[1:10:50] i have many young people in my church
[1:10:52] that have been eternally blessed and
[1:10:54] some of them are
[1:10:55] young parents now and they're here with
[1:10:56] their children and helping other young
[1:10:58] people and
[1:10:59] and i know that uh the reward is great
[1:11:02] and brother tim
[1:11:03] has just been like an older older
[1:11:06] older brother to me and
[1:11:10] he's not old i just had an older brother
[1:11:13] and he has been and he's
[1:11:14] he's helped me and he's given me much
[1:11:16] advice that i'm just thankful for
[1:11:19] one one piece of advice he gave me at
[1:11:20] youth camp one year i kept telling the
[1:11:22] young people i'm just like them that i'm
[1:11:24] just another young person i was in my
[1:11:26] 40s by this time and
[1:11:28] brother tim after one service says
[1:11:30] you're not a young man anymore
[1:11:34] from then on i've been old so i've uh
[1:11:36] but i
[1:11:37] certainly amen have valued their
[1:11:40] friendship brother ron
[1:11:41] spencer they've just been a special
[1:11:43] family to me to my family and
[1:11:45] at home in our church and i believe that
[1:11:50] god has placed us all together as the
[1:11:51] body of jesus christ
[1:11:53] and as the times get longer and and
[1:11:56] closer to the end we ought to stick that
[1:11:57] much closer together
[1:11:59] for satan is doing his best to to
[1:12:01] separate us and to try to
[1:12:03] try to bring walls between us but i
[1:12:06] believe between the bride of jesus
[1:12:07] christ or cannot be he's come to break
[1:12:09] down the middle wall is that right
[1:12:12] so we appreciate all that the lord has
[1:12:15] done
[1:12:15] in these meetings and i know when you
[1:12:17] have meetings like this and
[1:12:19] and you have the response that you have
[1:12:21] and you have the emotion that was here
[1:12:23] and is here it can even raise questions
[1:12:26] amongst people and people that have been
[1:12:28] around the message for a long time we
[1:12:30] want to talk a little bit about that
[1:12:32] today with the help of the lord
[1:12:34] and if i can title this this morning i'm
[1:12:36] just going to
[1:12:37] uh title this one word and i want to
[1:12:39] title it finishers
[1:12:42] finishers amen and if you're turning
[1:12:45] your bibles hebrews 12 we'll start at
[1:12:47] the first verse we're just going to read
[1:12:49] two
[1:12:50] two verses
[1:12:53] wherefore seeing we are
[1:12:56] also we also are
[1:12:59] com compassed about with so great a
[1:13:03] cloud of witnesses
[1:13:06] let us lay aside every weight
[1:13:09] and the sin which does so easily
[1:13:13] beset us and let us run with
[1:13:16] patience the race that is set before us
[1:13:21] looking unto jesus the author
[1:13:24] and finisher of our faith who for the
[1:13:28] joy that was
[1:13:29] set before him endured the cross
[1:13:33] despising the shame and is set down
[1:13:36] at the right hand of the throne of god
[1:13:40] you can be seated may the lord bless the
[1:13:42] reading of his word i'm just going to
[1:13:45] quote a verse or two out of
[1:13:48] the book of john as jesus
[1:13:51] is very close to his crucifixion and we
[1:13:54] know this is
[1:13:55] resurrection morning and what a morning
[1:13:57] it is
[1:13:58] amen but jesus when he's just a few
[1:14:02] moments away
[1:14:04] from his crucifixion he said he makes
[1:14:06] the statement
[1:14:08] i have glorified thee on the earth
[1:14:14] i have finished the work which thou
[1:14:18] gavest me to do
[1:14:22] so jesus says i finished the work
[1:14:27] you gave me to do i want you to think
[1:14:29] about that statement because
[1:14:32] they were trying to kill him to stop his
[1:14:33] work
[1:14:36] but he said he had finished it
[1:14:39] you see they couldn't kill him until he
[1:14:41] had finished
[1:14:43] they were fixing to kill him because the
[1:14:45] prophet said they didn't want the power
[1:14:49] that could heal the sick that could
[1:14:52] raise the dead
[1:14:54] that could clean up the mary magdalenes
[1:14:56] among us
[1:14:57] they didn't want the power that
[1:14:59] discerned
[1:15:01] that could forgive a man of his sins so
[1:15:03] they crucified him
[1:15:05] but jesus had said i'd finished the work
[1:15:10] when he was on the cross and he's giving
[1:15:12] up the ghost
[1:15:14] he he said it is finished
[1:15:18] amen so i want you to know the one who
[1:15:22] has called you
[1:15:24] is the finisher
[1:15:28] and paul has written
[1:15:31] he said we look unto jesus
[1:15:34] who is the author of our faith
[1:15:40] in case you're wondering where this
[1:15:41] message started
[1:15:44] it never started with brother branham
[1:15:48] jesus is the author
[1:15:52] and and services like this if i could
[1:15:54] just put it put it
[1:15:55] put it in a picture services like this
[1:15:57] are so important
[1:15:59] because i i believe in ministering to
[1:16:02] moments
[1:16:04] ministries about moments amen you asked
[1:16:07] moses after 80 years of contemplation
[1:16:10] and a training and
[1:16:11] knowledge and of message knowledge and
[1:16:13] of teaching by from his parents and
[1:16:16] teaching about god and all of his
[1:16:17] pedigree behind him and then
[1:16:19] all of his education and all of his
[1:16:21] science amen had not brought him closer
[1:16:24] to god
[1:16:25] until he had come into such a stalemate
[1:16:27] that his life he had forgot
[1:16:28] amen even thoughts of freedom he thought
[1:16:31] god would not use him he knew
[1:16:32] intellectually who he was
[1:16:34] amen but he didn't know experience by
[1:16:36] experience who he was
[1:16:38] you asked moses about those five minutes
[1:16:41] amen in the presence of a pillar of fire
[1:16:43] amen i want to tell you something you
[1:16:45] think drunk children are strange
[1:16:46] what about burning bushes amen amen if
[1:16:49] we had some burning bushes around here
[1:16:51] people would say hey that can't be god
[1:16:53] but you asked moses if it was god
[1:16:57] and moses's attitude toward the burning
[1:17:00] bush is what changed his life
[1:17:02] that bush said take off your shoes if he
[1:17:05] had not listened god would have never
[1:17:07] spoke to him again
[1:17:10] moments
[1:17:15] you say brother danny but i've seen
[1:17:16] people jump and shout and scream and get
[1:17:18] drunk
[1:17:19] live like a hypocrite
[1:17:22] i have to
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:27] i have two what's that got to do with
[1:17:30] anything
[1:17:34] i mean there's people out there
[1:17:36] laundering money all the time that don't
[1:17:37] stop you from using it
[1:17:39] [Applause]
[1:17:43] people rob banks you still go to work
[1:17:53] how do you know it's real brother danny
[1:17:54] how do you know it's real let me tell
[1:17:55] you my father
[1:17:57] had cruel hatred towards this message
[1:17:59] hated it with all his heart
[1:18:03] as i said the other night that he told
[1:18:05] he told us children as
[1:18:06] as little ones he told us and i can
[1:18:08] remember him taking us to this church
[1:18:09] and
[1:18:10] he would tell us not to believe what our
[1:18:11] mother believed and tried his best and
[1:18:13] his way to
[1:18:14] to to uh put in our minds
[1:18:18] what my mother was in was something
[1:18:21] wrong
[1:18:22] she was in a cult and i can remember him
[1:18:27] making my mother make a choice
[1:18:34] you stay with me or go with what you
[1:18:37] believe
[1:18:39] but you lose me and you lose your
[1:18:40] children
[1:18:43] he made her choose between her children
[1:18:48] and her god
[1:18:52] i want to tell you when you get to a
[1:18:53] point
[1:18:56] that when nothing else matters
[1:19:00] every relationship on earth doesn't have
[1:19:02] the hole that god does
[1:19:06] when you begin to realize that the lord
[1:19:08] jesus is the one that brought you here
[1:19:10] he's the one that gave you your children
[1:19:14] when you begin to realize that that's
[1:19:16] the one that called you
[1:19:17] amen then if you try to hold on to
[1:19:20] everything you're losing
[1:19:22] amen but when god saw her make that
[1:19:25] stand that i
[1:19:26] will choose amen to follow god
[1:19:29] amen it was just a moment where my daddy
[1:19:32] was trying to pressure her and i'm
[1:19:34] telling you
[1:19:34] it wasn't six months it wasn't six years
[1:19:37] amen but it was a moment of time that my
[1:19:40] drug came down in the kitchen it wasn't
[1:19:43] even in a church
[1:19:44] amen and he turned around and said i'll
[1:19:46] take you to the baptism
[1:19:48] i want you to know it's that kind of god
[1:19:51] that has come upon our young people
[1:19:53] because that moment amen in that moment
[1:19:57] the one amen that has called you has now
[1:20:00] let you know he's gonna finish it
[1:20:04] you don't have to worry about your
[1:20:06] children you don't have to worry about
[1:20:08] your family
[1:20:09] you got the one that created them in you
[1:20:15] you don't have to worry about what the
[1:20:16] doctor says you don't have to worry
[1:20:18] about who says
[1:20:20] what the guy that called you
[1:20:22] [Applause]
[1:20:30] he said brother name we're in the
[1:20:31] message we believe the word
[1:20:33] we're going to get to that you asked
[1:20:37] paul about the road to damascus
[1:20:40] you asked him what happened there amen
[1:20:43] in a moment
[1:20:47] he went from persecuting the church
[1:20:50] to leading it
[1:20:53] what did that the same pillar fire
[1:20:57] that spoke to moses came in the same
[1:21:01] pillar of fire
[1:21:02] amen that hovered over the earth the
[1:21:04] same pillar of fire
[1:21:06] that talked to abraham the same pillar
[1:21:09] of fire that had its photograph taken
[1:21:13] the same pillar of fire that's been in
[1:21:16] these meetings
[1:21:17] [Applause]
[1:21:26] you asked paul about it
[1:21:29] this is resurrection morning
[1:21:32] the prophet said what a resurrection
[1:21:34] that was
[1:21:36] but he said what a resurrection this is
[1:21:40] because we have been resurrected out of
[1:21:43] cold
[1:21:44] dark denominationalism so i got to ask
[1:21:48] you this question does this church
[1:21:50] look like the first one that's the
[1:21:52] answer that's the answer we're looking
[1:21:54] for
[1:21:56] does this church look like the first one
[1:22:01] because it's what the word says that
[1:22:03] counts
[1:22:04] it's not what a preacher says it's not
[1:22:07] what a critic says
[1:22:08] it's not what anybody else says over
[1:22:10] your experience it's what the word is
[1:22:12] said
[1:22:17] that's what matters
[1:22:21] brother ram said that jesus christ was
[1:22:24] the person the man
[1:22:25] god he was the manifestation of god he
[1:22:27] was god in a body form
[1:22:29] to reflect the word of god for that age
[1:22:32] to make that age see god's promise for
[1:22:35] that age
[1:22:37] and the holy ghost is the same thing
[1:22:39] today it's a spirit of god
[1:22:40] upon the written word trying to find
[1:22:42] somebody
[1:22:43] to reflect itself to this age to prove
[1:22:46] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:22:48] forever
[1:22:50] saint john 14 12 the works that i do
[1:22:52] shall you do also
[1:22:54] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:22:57] and forever see
[1:22:58] constantly trying to find a way to
[1:23:01] reflect itself
[1:23:04] they couldn't do it the people thought
[1:23:05] so much of their denominations
[1:23:08] and their little nests that they had and
[1:23:09] so forth they called their churches so
[1:23:12] they wouldn't listen to it
[1:23:14] and so they do it today same thing they
[1:23:16] crucify him afresh
[1:23:18] and peter on the day of pentecost he
[1:23:20] said you men that dwell
[1:23:22] in jerusalem and in judea hearken to my
[1:23:24] words
[1:23:25] these are not drunk as you suppose
[1:23:30] and he said if you'll stand still i'll
[1:23:32] show you what it is
[1:23:36] and he goes ahead and explains to him
[1:23:39] now
[1:23:41] just bear with me a little bit this
[1:23:42] morning that
[1:23:45] we get so worried about the hypocrite
[1:23:50] we get so worried about the crooked
[1:23:52] preacher
[1:23:54] you know we hear so often you know why
[1:23:56] why should we listen to preachers you
[1:23:57] know they
[1:23:58] take you into false doctrine
[1:24:01] you know just get it straight from the
[1:24:02] tape
[1:24:04] you know it ain't going to go wrong if
[1:24:05] you push play
[1:24:08] well let me talk about the holy ghost a
[1:24:09] minute
[1:24:11] see because the bible says the rain
[1:24:13] falls on the unjust
[1:24:16] and the just well let me just say it
[1:24:19] right it falls on the just
[1:24:21] and the unjust you know brother branham
[1:24:23] you know god sent you a prophet that
[1:24:24] explained his experience to the baptist
[1:24:26] church and through the pentecostal
[1:24:27] church and
[1:24:28] and the gift that was in his life to
[1:24:30] discern and and he he talked about his
[1:24:32] experiences in the early pentecostal
[1:24:33] church and
[1:24:34] and the things he saw how the holy
[1:24:36] spirit would fall upon the congregation
[1:24:38] and they'd raise up and speak in tongues
[1:24:40] and he talked about the two men he said
[1:24:42] one was a real
[1:24:43] godly man but the other man was living
[1:24:45] with another with another woman other
[1:24:47] than his wife
[1:24:48] and he said if that's the way it is i
[1:24:50] don't want nothing to do with it because
[1:24:51] he didn't understand it
[1:24:53] you understand how god could fall
[1:24:56] and anoint a person like that but then
[1:24:58] one day god showed him and he read to
[1:25:00] him out of the book of
[1:25:01] hebrews and showed him how the rain
[1:25:03] falls on the just
[1:25:05] and the unjust and and he said it came
[1:25:08] to me
[1:25:10] amen that the same rain that makes the
[1:25:12] weak to grow makes the weeds grow
[1:25:15] and the same holy spirit that can fall
[1:25:17] in a bunch of people can bless a
[1:25:18] hypocrite
[1:25:19] just the same as it blesses another i
[1:25:21] you know i think our god is really big
[1:25:24] that he would not only bless his people
[1:25:25] he would bless those that weren't his
[1:25:27] people
[1:25:28] that at least they'd have a moment
[1:25:32] he may not go to heaven but to have a
[1:25:38] moment
[1:25:40] and the same holy spirit can fall in a
[1:25:42] bunch of people and can bless a
[1:25:44] hypocrite
[1:25:45] just the same as it blesses the other
[1:25:47] and jesus says
[1:25:48] by their fruits you shall know them
[1:25:54] not whether he shouts whether he
[1:25:56] rejoices
[1:25:57] but it's by his fruit you shall know him
[1:26:01] i said there you are i got it lord and
[1:26:03] that is really the truth a man could
[1:26:06] have gifts without knowing god
[1:26:09] so then i was getting too critical on
[1:26:11] speaking with tongues you see but then
[1:26:12] one day god
[1:26:14] vindicated that to me
[1:26:18] amen i i want to make a statement see
[1:26:21] because you're young people you've got
[1:26:22] to take something home with you
[1:26:26] you've got to take what has happened
[1:26:27] here and not leave it here
[1:26:32] god isn't asking you no you can't
[1:26:33] replicate a service like this every time
[1:26:36] but god isn't asking you to do that but
[1:26:38] you know god has to shock your system
[1:26:40] sometimes
[1:26:41] to get you out of something you know
[1:26:43] you've been pulled by the devil for
[1:26:45] years and years and years
[1:26:46] but one of those moments can shock you
[1:26:48] amen and to turn your
[1:26:50] thinking where it's a paradox brother
[1:26:52] adam said where you were going one way
[1:26:54] and all of a sudden you turned and
[1:26:56] all those devils who have lived and
[1:26:58] encamped in your life
[1:26:59] for all those years think about him in
[1:27:01] the maniac of godera asked him about it
[1:27:03] was it teaching
[1:27:04] that brought him out of it or was it a
[1:27:06] man that met him on the road
[1:27:08] amen that man had been in he lost his
[1:27:10] family
[1:27:11] and he's up in the tombs and he can't
[1:27:13] help himself and no man can help him
[1:27:15] but jesus said i gotta go to louisiana
[1:27:18] because there's somebody there that is
[1:27:21] bound and they can't be free
[1:27:23] and i'm gonna give them a moment
[1:27:28] i'm gonna give you girls a moment
[1:27:31] i'm going to give you boys a moment
[1:27:34] amen it's going to change you you've
[1:27:36] been bound you couldn't dress
[1:27:38] right you couldn't live right you
[1:27:40] couldn't talk right
[1:27:41] but then jesus came
[1:27:53] do you think that man some of you just
[1:27:55] looking at me like a mule looking a new
[1:27:57] gate
[1:27:58] go ahead and enjoy it do you think that
[1:28:01] man said i learned that in the baptist
[1:28:03] church
[1:28:04] i sat down for six months
[1:28:07] under some teaching and i learned i had
[1:28:09] a devil
[1:28:19] there was a desire in that man well
[1:28:22] we've used this before i'm going to use
[1:28:23] it again because it's another generation
[1:28:26] there is desire in that man amen when
[1:28:29] jesus came
[1:28:30] that man was standing in his way because
[1:28:34] something had pulled him down there
[1:28:36] and it was his desire he wasn't free yet
[1:28:41] but his desire had brought him there
[1:28:44] and he was called legion what's your
[1:28:46] name legion
[1:28:47] a couple thousand devils could not stop
[1:28:50] one man's desire
[1:28:52] they might have made him live wrong they
[1:28:54] might have destroyed his family
[1:28:57] listen to me young man they might have
[1:28:58] destroyed his family
[1:29:00] amen they might have made him strip his
[1:29:02] clothes off
[1:29:03] they might have made him lose his mind
[1:29:05] but they could not stop a predestinated
[1:29:08] seed
[1:29:08] that laid on the inside of them this man
[1:29:11] was not a hypocrite
[1:29:13] this man was election and because
[1:29:16] election was there
[1:29:17] leoducia couldn't stop it even no
[1:29:20] preacher could stop it
[1:29:22] nobody could stop it he had to get to
[1:29:36] jesus
[1:29:38] jesus had a bunch of jews in his boat
[1:29:43] they're the revelated ones you know
[1:29:46] they're the ones with the knowledge of
[1:29:47] the message
[1:29:50] and they're sitting there they don't
[1:29:51] have a clue what's going on
[1:29:53] jesus said let's go to the other side
[1:29:55] satan knew it
[1:29:57] he knew jesus went everywhere with
[1:29:58] purpose he's come to do a work he wasn't
[1:30:00] coming to play
[1:30:01] games these meetings are not games he'd
[1:30:03] come to finish the work
[1:30:05] so satan knew he wasn't playing games
[1:30:06] and he looked upon that boat
[1:30:08] and he tried his best to sink it but
[1:30:11] jesus has said let's go on to the other
[1:30:13] side
[1:30:14] i got a purpose in going over there to
[1:30:15] that country i'm not going to people
[1:30:17] like you jews
[1:30:18] but i'm going to somebody that's got the
[1:30:20] same seed inside of them
[1:30:22] amen that you have inside of you amen
[1:30:25] and that election drew
[1:30:28] [Applause]
[1:30:32] god your election has drawn god
[1:30:37] then some old pharisee will step back
[1:30:39] and look at some young drunk person
[1:30:42] say that's not the way our church
[1:30:44] believes it well i got news for you i
[1:30:46] didn't come because of your church
[1:30:48] amen i came because of the word and the
[1:30:52] word said
[1:30:53] he who the son has set free is free
[1:30:56] indeed
[1:30:57] don't tell me how to act
[1:31:02] there ain't no church can tell me how to
[1:31:04] act there ain't no church you can tell
[1:31:06] me
[1:31:07] amen who my god is
[1:31:10] amen if god is inside of me it'll
[1:31:12] express
[1:31:13] itself because the word said he would
[1:31:17] amen brother derek he's the same
[1:31:19] yesterday today and forever
[1:31:29] you asked that maniac about that moment
[1:31:39] well that's better yet let's ask those
[1:31:42] devils about that moment
[1:31:49] i don't need to ask any preacher it's
[1:31:52] all right if you do
[1:31:54] i don't need to ask anybody what those
[1:31:57] devils thought about it
[1:32:02] they were hoping that that maniac would
[1:32:05] push play
[1:32:12] brother danny you're touching something
[1:32:14] sacred
[1:32:16] really all i'm doing is touching your
[1:32:18] cold dark denominationalism
[1:32:25] it was not god that told you to quit
[1:32:27] preaching
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:32] i said it wasn't god but you know
[1:32:34] there's a lot of preachers messed up i
[1:32:35] do there's a lot of people messed up too
[1:32:39] but i'm going to tell you one person
[1:32:40] who's not intimidated if others preach
[1:32:42] his message and that's the prophets
[1:32:45] and i'm going to tell you about another
[1:32:46] prophet stood up to a young man stand up
[1:32:49] phillip
[1:32:50] you're a young man perhaps you've got a
[1:32:51] call in your hearts but you're a little
[1:32:53] shaky because
[1:32:54] you don't know somebody's told you we
[1:32:55] don't have to preach anymore

[1:32:58] evangelist your teacher your pastor

[1:33:54] timothy
[1:33:55] amen i don't want you to neglect the
[1:33:57] gift that is within you but i want you
[1:33:59] to stir it up
[1:34:00] for the spirit speaketh expressly at the
[1:34:02] last days
[1:34:03] amen men will give heed to seducing
[1:34:05] spirits and they'll give heed to all
[1:34:07] kinds of doctrines and devils
[1:34:09] amen but what are you gonna do timothy
[1:34:11] you're gonna finish
[1:34:13] amen i've called you to preach the word
[1:34:15] i've called you to finish what god has
[1:34:17] started
[1:34:20] thank you buddy i love you
[1:34:26] there's a devil around our message let
[1:34:29] me tell you again there's a devil around
[1:34:31] our message
[1:34:32] it is not an alternative doctrine it is
[1:34:35] a seducing spirit
[1:34:37] that doesn't want the holy ghost to rise
[1:34:39] up in your life
[1:34:41] and preach the word because god has said
[1:34:44] you are the final voice
[1:34:46] to the final age under the messenger of
[1:34:49] the rage
[1:34:57] come on out of babylon come on out of
[1:35:00] those cape churches
[1:35:02] come a lot of dark denominationalism
[1:35:05] come on you maniacs come on out
[1:35:23] that ain't the word tells you to stop
[1:35:26] preaching
[1:35:31] well who do i stay with him brother tim
[1:35:33] or brother branham who do i stay with
[1:35:38] if you'd actually listened when you
[1:35:39] press play you would know
[1:35:49] why are you saying that brother danny
[1:35:51] well it ain't in my notes it must be in
[1:35:53] your heart
[1:35:57] it's in your heart i'm going to say it
[1:35:59] the devil's lying to you
[1:36:02] and he's made you to trust in another
[1:36:04] doctrine of balaam
[1:36:06] and put your comfort in a building and
[1:36:09] some son of
[1:36:10] a prophet god never called you to be
[1:36:12] that way
[1:36:13] he called you to be a son and if you're
[1:36:16] a son
[1:36:17] he gave a spirit to confirm it that's
[1:36:20] what the holy ghost
[1:36:21] is that's what this resurrection is all
[1:36:23] about
[1:36:28] i may get in trouble that's all right
[1:36:30] it's a fight worth fighting every one of
[1:36:31] you young men
[1:36:32] it's a fight worth fighting it's a
[1:36:34] gospel worth preaching
[1:36:36] amen i said it again it's a gospel worth
[1:36:38] preaching
[1:36:39] amen we're not sitting here with nothing
[1:36:41] to say we got something to say
[1:36:44] because the holy spirit has given us
[1:36:46] utterance
[1:36:48] ask that maniac what that day meant to
[1:36:51] him
[1:36:56] because it's about moments
[1:37:09] tell you what the prophet said prophet
[1:37:12] said stay with the word
[1:37:15] so that the spirit of the word will be
[1:37:17] upon the people
[1:37:19] he never said stay with the man he said
[1:37:21] stay with the word
[1:37:23] because the word will produce a ministry
[1:37:26] that has been born of the word but when
[1:37:29] you have a pulpit compromising or
[1:37:31] promoting a certain doctrine
[1:37:33] that doctrine has seed that will produce
[1:37:36] its own ministry
[1:37:38] and that ministry will only reflect the
[1:37:40] doctrine that's been promoted in the
[1:37:42] personality of the one promoting it
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:47] help me lord
[1:37:50] but when a ministry starts under another
[1:37:53] holy ghost ministry
[1:37:55] it can only reflect the holy ghost and
[1:37:57] have the boldness that comes from
[1:37:59] operating
[1:38:00] in the holy spirit and not the boldness
[1:38:03] of another man's personality
[1:38:09] seen so much of that copycat ministries
[1:38:14] but the holy ghost has a ministry
[1:38:20] it was a paradox there was a moment it
[1:38:23] was a moment on acts 2
[1:38:26] where a bunch of cowards were turned
[1:38:28] into bold preachers and witnesses
[1:38:31] they had knowledge they'd seen miracles
[1:38:34] but now the holy spirit come amen and
[1:38:38] how
[1:38:39] then people in the upper room there they
[1:38:40] were afraid of the jews
[1:38:42] and they had walked with jesus but when
[1:38:43] the holy spirit came
[1:38:45] they weren't afraid no more out into the
[1:38:48] street they went screaming and falling
[1:38:50] and
[1:38:50] acting like a bunch of drunk people
[1:38:53] you ever seen a drunk person
[1:38:58] yes last night we saw a few yeah i've
[1:39:01] seen them on
[1:39:03] on alcohol he's so drunk
[1:39:07] remember one time being another brothers
[1:39:11] is in the wintertime he's in another
[1:39:13] country region
[1:39:15] we're driving down the road and there's
[1:39:18] snow everywhere
[1:39:19] it's bitter cold we see a man
[1:39:23] down in the ditch and he's stuck on a
[1:39:27] barbed wire fence
[1:39:30] he can't get off of it
[1:39:33] well he stopped the car we better help
[1:39:35] this guy
[1:39:36] we went down there and that guy was so
[1:39:39] drunk
[1:39:42] he didn't care if he was hung up on a
[1:39:44] fence
[1:39:47] he was hung there and we're trying to he
[1:39:49] was so big he's bigger than both of us
[1:39:51] brothers put together and we're trying
[1:39:52] to
[1:39:53] trying to pick him up and get him over
[1:39:54] the fence it wasn't working i can
[1:39:55] remember i can remember very clearly
[1:39:57] that the only way i could get him over
[1:39:58] the fence was put my
[1:39:59] my foot on his
[1:40:05] his back and i pushed him over and i
[1:40:08] pushed him over and he went on his
[1:40:09] nose landed in the snow
[1:40:13] laid there for a minute he got back up
[1:40:16] and he looked at me and he goes
[1:40:18] hey he didn't care if i had kicked him
[1:40:22] he pulled his wallet out and he was
[1:40:24] trying to give us money
[1:40:26] and the man was drunk he didn't care
[1:40:31] forgot about
[1:40:37] something about being drunk you start
[1:40:43] forgetting there's one thing god wants
[1:40:46] you to do is you want you to learn to
[1:40:47] forget
[1:40:49] what the enemy has done
[1:40:52] so that you can realize the power of god
[1:40:55] is bigger than any memory
[1:40:58] any action somebody might have treated
[1:41:01] you wrong but our god is a good
[1:41:03] good good good good man amen he owns a
[1:41:06] cattle on a thousand hills
[1:41:08] he's the prince of peace somebody might
[1:41:10] have done you wrong
[1:41:12] you might got scars in your life but
[1:41:14] he's got a couple he wants to show you
[1:41:16] himself
[1:41:16] then there were your scars he engraved
[1:41:19] you in the palms of his hands
[1:41:21] he said i'll never forget you and i'm
[1:41:24] going to give you a moment down here at
[1:41:26] easter camp
[1:41:27] that you'll never forget me
[1:41:40] but does this new church
[1:41:43] this new revelation the gospel malachi 4
[1:41:47] produced drunk children is that really
[1:41:49] of god
[1:41:50] brother danny
[1:41:55] i want to tell you about a moment
[1:41:58] in our church and tell you in the church
[1:42:01] i came out of we never had those moments
[1:42:05] we didn't even know how to say amen
[1:42:10] we were so dumbed down that whatever the
[1:42:12] preacher said we've blindly followed it
[1:42:14] because
[1:42:15] our safety was in the denomination
[1:42:19] my mama believed my daddy believed it
[1:42:22] they all believed it so i'm
[1:42:23] in it i must be all right so i remember
[1:42:26] one time very clearly my cousin
[1:42:28] asked me if i was still preaching and i
[1:42:30] said yes and
[1:42:31] he said you're still preaching what
[1:42:32] william brandon preached i said yes and
[1:42:34] he said
[1:42:35] i said why do you ask and he said
[1:42:37] because he's went to hell
[1:42:40] and i said well i said because you asked
[1:42:43] that
[1:42:44] i want to ask you a question how many
[1:42:47] books of brother branham have you
[1:42:49] actually studied or tapes listened to
[1:42:51] to say this man has went to hell
[1:42:54] here's what dark denominationalism will
[1:42:56] do this is what fallen a preacher will
[1:42:58] do
[1:42:59] because i haven't read any
[1:43:03] but my daddy read one book and told me
[1:43:05] it was no good
[1:43:07] so you read one book and sent a man to
[1:43:09] hell
[1:43:11] it wasn't it wasn't that it was the
[1:43:14] denominationalism you're under
[1:43:16] that don't want that power
[1:43:20] they don't know their bible and if they
[1:43:23] don't know their bible how can they
[1:43:24] rightly discern
[1:43:27] and if you don't have the spirit of god
[1:43:28] in you how can you rightly discern
[1:43:31] and if you don't have the spirit of god
[1:43:32] in you and say that what's fallen on the
[1:43:34] kids is not of god
[1:43:35] you're not going to like it either and i
[1:43:37] don't care if you are a preacher
[1:43:41] we had it happen in our church
[1:43:45] drunk kids laying all over the place
[1:43:50] the police even came
[1:43:56] they came and our kids ran to the car
[1:44:00] it says great save a cop
[1:44:05] defund the police the right way
[1:44:08] let them have nobody to go after.
[1:44:13] i'm serious they were hanging out of
[1:44:14] trees
[1:44:16] they were laying on the ground
[1:44:20] on the platform
[1:44:24] and some of them today are so far in the
[1:44:27] world
[1:44:29] then they couldn't have been a god
[1:44:33] because if it didn't save all of them
[1:44:34] then it couldn't have been a god
[1:44:38] stand up seth stand up joshua hey man
[1:44:42] i'll tell you what came out of that rain
[1:44:46] deacons sunday school teachers song
[1:44:49] leaders
[1:44:50] some of them aren't here preachers
[1:44:54] that came out of that rain they got
[1:44:55] drunk
[1:45:00] i think these guys are pretty good
[1:45:03] i happen to think the holy ghost did a
[1:45:04] good job
[1:45:19] i'll tell you you said i know you guys
[1:45:21] want to keep standing but you can say
[1:45:23] we had others it fell on we had to carry
[1:45:26] them they was laughing they was
[1:45:27] carrying on they were drunk as those
[1:45:29] guys
[1:45:31] and they're so far in the world today
[1:45:34] and if i would spend all of my time
[1:45:36] looking at them and say see what happens
[1:45:38] to drunk people
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:42] i've totally missed it that's right
[1:45:45] because it's not about those that never
[1:45:47] continued
[1:45:53] and it's not about those that started
[1:45:56] and couldn't
[1:45:57] finish
[1:46:02] it's time to wear your coat buddy it's
[1:46:04] not about the starter
[1:46:06] it's about the finisher and god never
[1:46:09] called me here to start and remember the
[1:46:12] one that started this work
[1:46:14] is also a finisher inside of me he never
[1:46:17] taught me to stop
[1:46:19] he called me all the way to a change of
[1:46:21] my body
[1:46:22] [Applause]
[1:46:24] hallelujah
[1:46:35] i'll tell you who the spirit fell upon
[1:46:37] if the spirit did not fall upon you and
[1:46:39] make you a son
[1:46:44] you were already sons but it fell on
[1:46:47] some who weren't sons
[1:46:49] so they jumped like other sons but they
[1:46:52] had nothing in them to finish
[1:46:54] but when it falls on some suns where
[1:46:56] were you job
[1:46:57] where were you job where were you joe
[1:47:00] before the foundation of the world
[1:47:02] i'll tell you where you were you were in
[1:47:04] the mind of god
[1:47:05] you were in his heart and he brought you
[1:47:08] down to this earth
[1:47:09] to express his heart and i'm going to
[1:47:13] express it
[1:47:18] if he finished his work we're going to
[1:47:21] finish ours
[1:47:38] if you trust me amen it fell upon sons
[1:47:42] who did the holy spirit fall upon its
[1:47:44] core and sons who did it fall upon the
[1:47:46] day of pentecost
[1:47:47] sons it did not make you sons you
[1:47:50] are already sons it only brought you
[1:47:53] into your adopted position as a son
[1:47:56] as you were in the world you couldn't
[1:47:58] cast the check
[1:47:59] amen but now that you've been baptized
[1:48:02] you can
[1:48:02] cash it ask what you will and it shall
[1:48:05] be given
[1:48:05] unto you
[1:48:16] sons but
[1:48:21] but but brother danny we know better
[1:48:24] than that
[1:48:27] and people in people spoke in tongues
[1:48:31] got the holy ghost you know we're in the
[1:48:33] message now we've went a little bit
[1:48:34] deeper
[1:48:36] lord give me my breath please
[1:48:41] he said you're over 50 deal with it
[1:48:52] hey lord will i watch judas
[1:48:57] stand there and point his finger
[1:49:00] and so devils they may come out
[1:49:03] how can i trust anything like that
[1:49:07] amen amen your concern is not the judas
[1:49:11] is among us
[1:49:13] your concern is not the websites among
[1:49:15] us
[1:49:16] that are preaching against a prophet
[1:49:18] amen i'll tell you
[1:49:19] you would turn to judas and say where
[1:49:21] does he reside
[1:49:25] why are you going to listen to a man
[1:49:26] that had a god-given holy ghost ministry
[1:49:31] but couldn't finish
[1:49:39] you want to criticize something like
[1:49:40] this i'll tell you what your problem is
[1:49:44] i'm not nobody's telling you you have to
[1:49:46] run the shop to have it nobody has said
[1:49:48] that
[1:49:51] but what god wants to do to you is get
[1:49:54] you out from behind your shell
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:49:58] if you stand there like a post and the
[1:50:00] holy ghost comes upon you and pulls you
[1:50:02] out of your shell
[1:50:03] and you stand there and you just say oh
[1:50:04] god amen that's good enough for god
[1:50:08] but it's what comes after
[1:50:13] and if you spend your time in a service
[1:50:15] like this looking at that well that's
[1:50:16] not god that's not
[1:50:17] all you're telling me is you've never
[1:50:18] come out from behind your shell
[1:50:20] i don't care if you're a preacher and
[1:50:22] you've been in the message 700 years
[1:50:23] that's a long time if you're counting
[1:50:25] if you've been there that long and you
[1:50:26] know all the quotes you can quote it
[1:50:28] better than every preacher on here
[1:50:29] combined
[1:50:30] it means nothing to god amen because if
[1:50:33] he hasn't come to you in a moment
[1:50:35] on the sacred sands of revelation and
[1:50:38] change you there
[1:50:39] amen to a new creature in christ jesus
[1:50:42] baptizing you into the body of christ
[1:50:45] you're as dead as judas is
[1:50:52] we got too many people that know about
[1:50:54] the message but not the god the sinners
[1:51:08] until you brother brahma says we haven't
[1:51:10] come to talk about it we've come to get
[1:51:12] under it
[1:51:15] we come to try to absorb teaching we
[1:51:17] come to get under the word
[1:51:19] amen the devil's lied to some of you and
[1:51:21] thought the more you knew about it what
[1:51:22] then you would have it
[1:51:23] that's not it amen the more you know
[1:51:26] about it the more faith you should have
[1:51:28] amen the more you know about it the more
[1:51:30] faith you should have not more criticism
[1:51:33] not more criticism
[1:51:36] come on
[1:51:41] these doctrines of devils that tell you
[1:51:43] that you listen to a tape a day or get
[1:51:44] the holy ghost that's a doctrine of the
[1:51:46] devil
[1:51:47] because the devil wants you to think
[1:51:48] you've got comfort in something
[1:51:50] mechanical
[1:51:51] and you can listen your ability to
[1:51:53] listen is not going to give you the holy
[1:51:55] ghost
[1:51:56] amen your ability to surrender amen is
[1:51:58] when the god comes into your life
[1:52:00] and he said i will change you amen until
[1:52:03] you're not the same
[1:52:18] brother danny have you had if you had
[1:52:20] hypocrites in your poll no doubt
[1:52:21] probably have some more i don't know
[1:52:24] i should have said that
[1:52:28] no i don't want that but you know
[1:52:31] we're not allowed to know everything
[1:52:35] that's right and if you're worried about
[1:52:36] that ask jesus why in the world he
[1:52:38] looked at you said hey come follow me
[1:52:41] [Music]
[1:52:43] you guys know that brother branham had
[1:52:45] some boys with them turned into
[1:52:46] homosexuals what kind of message are you
[1:52:47] in same one jesus is in that called you
[1:52:49] just come stand with him
[1:52:54] the same one that paul was in that asked
[1:52:55] demas to follow him
[1:53:00] had guys in this congregation like
[1:53:02] alexander and harmonies we got any of
[1:53:03] those here
[1:53:05] just checking
[1:53:10] you know alexander and heiminis had more
[1:53:12] revelation than paul did
[1:53:15] they said the resurrection has passed
[1:53:16] already paul and it's because what you
[1:53:18] said
[1:53:19] we are now seated in heavenly places
[1:53:21] incredible glory to god
[1:53:23] if we're in heavenly places the
[1:53:24] resurrection is already over
[1:53:28] and overthrow the faith of son
[1:53:32] you know the lord has already come
[1:53:38] well i got you to be quiet anyway
[1:53:43] you know where the bride do you know
[1:53:46] this is the bright age
[1:53:52] for me to say that did not give me the
[1:53:54] right to start another doctor
[1:53:56] [Applause]
[1:53:59] or to even tell you we're in the bright
[1:54:01] age
[1:54:05] we're in the layout of seeing age what
[1:54:08] is the bright age it's the age of
[1:54:09] maturity
[1:54:10] it's the age of finishers it's the
[1:54:14] rapture age
[1:54:15] it's the harvest age it's the cycle the
[1:54:18] full cycle age
[1:54:20] don't go tell me we've left that age oh
[1:54:22] brother danny the prophet is no longer
[1:54:24] the messenger to the bride now
[1:54:25] now the holy spirit is but if you'd
[1:54:27] actually read your bible you find out he
[1:54:29] is actually the messenger in every age
[1:54:34] if you actually read your bible but
[1:54:36] because men want to be the leaders
[1:54:38] they've got to promote something that'll
[1:54:40] put their flesh in it
[1:54:42] amen god never called you to be like
[1:54:44] that
[1:54:45] amen he called you to be the final voice
[1:54:48] under the
[1:54:48] final age amen in this layout of sia
[1:54:53] to prove to satan he's not interested in
[1:54:56] proving it to other preachers
[1:54:58] he's interested in proving it to that
[1:55:00] son of a morning
[1:55:01] he's interested in proving it to lucifer
[1:55:04] this bride
[1:55:06] this bride this bride is not like that
[1:55:10] one
[1:55:11] she's not like that eve just stay with
[1:55:14] the word
[1:55:15] she'll believe the word she'll finish
[1:55:18] [Applause]
[1:55:30] finishers
[1:55:34] god never gave any minister the right to
[1:55:36] change the age that a prophet didn't
[1:55:39] [Applause]
[1:55:40] [Music]
[1:55:44] how dare you think you're more spiritual
[1:55:45] than the prophet that came
[1:55:48] by god behold i send them to you
[1:55:51] he elijah oh you said brother danny but
[1:55:52] you said if you don't you don't have to
[1:55:54] you don't have to push play to believe
[1:55:56] we listen come on now
[1:55:58] you got more with you than that you got
[1:56:01] more in the tank than that
[1:56:06] god wants to use you what is he saying

[1:56:10] like never before
[1:56:19] young people what you got in you tell
[1:56:22] you
[1:56:23] some people have trivialized the holy
[1:56:24] ghost made it a little simple doctrine
[1:56:27] that we get now we go on and we learn
[1:56:28] all the great things
[1:56:30] i got news for you the token
[1:56:34] is what was needed to follow the seals
[1:56:42] that little simple doctrine
[1:56:45] and here's what the scripture says young
[1:56:48] people
[1:56:49] i want you to know something you might
[1:56:51] have felt real good last night and
[1:56:53] jumped up and down the screen that's
[1:56:54] wonderful and i love it for you it's a
[1:56:56] moment
[1:56:57] that you should never forget now
[1:56:59] tomorrow
[1:57:01] you may not feel like that
[1:57:05] but now god wants to tell you what has
[1:57:08] happened
[1:57:11] and paul's going to echo his voice
[1:57:13] brother branham's going to echo his
[1:57:14] we're going to echo ours
[1:57:17] here's what the holy spirit is he's your
[1:57:20] guide
[1:57:22] he guides you to a place and he can
[1:57:24] guide you out
[1:57:28] that's right he never guided you to lay
[1:57:31] out a seal and then they change the
[1:57:33] gender of people and he says okay i
[1:57:34] don't know who they are anymore
[1:57:37] i can't guide him he's the guide
[1:57:41] not only is he a god this is why satan
[1:57:43] wants to trivialize it
[1:57:45] he's a comforter holy spirit is god he's
[1:57:49] a comforter
[1:57:52] the one that comes along amen and when
[1:57:54] the devil begins to
[1:57:55] fight throw arrows in your brain and
[1:57:57] nothing really happened there
[1:57:58] there's a comforter there brother
[1:58:00] liddell amen that begins to tell you
[1:58:02] amen don't forget what i have done amen
[1:58:05] that i have started the work i'm also
[1:58:07] able to finish it
[1:58:12] i'm your comforter
[1:58:13] [Applause]
[1:58:16] i'm a comforter when you wanted to quit
[1:58:20] when the pressure got so hard when the
[1:58:23] devil said if that's the way it's going
[1:58:24] to be i no longer serve him
[1:58:27] he was the comforter
[1:58:34] wanted to be a quitter
[1:58:39] somebody help me just can't take it no
[1:58:42] more

[1:58:46] i've been told this i can't
[1:58:48] take it no more i don't give up
[1:58:53] i have wanted to quit but i got good
[1:58:56] news for you some of you drunken folks
[1:58:57] that were rolling around on the floor
[1:58:59] a finisher moved up on the inside of you
[1:59:02] [Music]

[1:59:11] take him out

[1:59:22] guide he is a comforter he's a spirit of
[1:59:28] truth
