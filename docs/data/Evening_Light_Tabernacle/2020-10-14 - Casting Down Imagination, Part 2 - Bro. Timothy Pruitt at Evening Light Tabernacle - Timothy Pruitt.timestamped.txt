[10:15] a god that is full of grace a god whose
[10:18] love
[10:20] would not allow you to stay in heaven
[10:22] but you came down to earth
[10:25] to pay the price of redemption and to
[10:27] bring healing
[10:28] and deliverance for your people lord we
[10:31] thank you that you're that kind of a god
[10:33] that
[10:34] even as the psalmist would say what is
[10:36] man that thou art mindful of him
[10:38] or the son of man the prophets that you
[10:40] would visit them
[10:42] but oh god you have been mindful of man
[10:47] though we don't understand how the great
[10:49] god of heaven
[10:50] who created this son the moon the stars
[10:53] of the universe
[10:54] who is so great and we're just a tiny
[10:58] [Music]
[10:59] little bitty speck out in the universe
[11:03] just as big as a piece of dust compared
[11:06] to
[11:07] many of the planets and places around
[11:10] in the universe but you cared so much
[11:15] that god became a part of this dust
[11:18] took on humanity to pay the price of
[11:21] redemption
[11:22] what a mighty god we serve
[11:26] lord we have we've been here in this

[28:23] and i'll tell you i lived it
[28:25] i lived it and so we're here to uh
[28:28] minister on it again second corinthians
[28:30] 10
[28:31] and verse 3 for though we walk in the
[28:33] flesh
[28:34] we do not war after the flesh for the
[28:37] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[28:40] but mighty through god to the pulling
[28:42] down of strongholds
[28:44] casting down imaginations and every high
[28:48] thing that exalted itself
[28:50] against the knowledge of god and
[28:52] bringing into captivity
[28:54] every thought to the obedience of christ
[28:58] amen every thought philippians 2 and
[29:01] verse 1 it says if there be any
[29:03] therefore any consolation in christ if
[29:06] any comfort of love
[29:08] if any fellowship of the spirit if any
[29:11] bowels and mercy
[29:12] fulfill ye my joy that you be
[29:14] like-minded
[29:15] having the same love being of one accord
[29:18] and of one mind
[29:20] let nothing be done through strife or
[29:22] vain glory
[29:23] but in lowliness of mind let each esteem
[29:26] the other better than themselves look
[29:29] not
[29:29] every man to his own things but every
[29:31] man also to the things of others
[29:34] let this mind be in you which was also
[29:38] in christ
[29:38] jesus who being in the form of god
[29:41] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[29:43] god
[29:44] let this mind be in you but made himself
[29:47] of no reputation and took upon him the
[29:49] form of a servant
[29:51] and was made in the likeness of men and
[29:54] being found in the fashion of man
[29:56] he humbled himself and became obedient
[29:58] unto death
[29:59] even the death of the cross wherefore
[30:02] god also hath highly exalted him
[30:05] and given him a name which is above
[30:07] every name
[30:08] that at the name of jesus every knee
[30:10] shall bow on things in heaven
[30:12] things in earth and things under the
[30:14] earth and that every tongue should
[30:16] confess
[30:17] that jesus christ is lord the glory
[30:20] of god the father amen we let you be
[30:23] seated this evening
[30:25] casting down imaginations
[30:29] you know our mind constantly bombards us
[30:33] with thoughts and think you know i
[30:35] thought sometimes you can go very deep
[30:37] into things even before you even realize
[30:39] it
[30:40] and sometimes your thoughts don't take
[30:41] you down very good paths
[30:44] many times you can you know feel
[30:46] something in your body and your thoughts
[30:47] begin to work and
[30:49] and you begin to think of what what i
[30:50] might have and next thing you know you
[30:53] self-diagnosed yourself and you put
[30:54] yourself in the grave
[30:56] and that's where your thoughts will take
[30:57] you if you allow them to go that
[30:59] keep going on down that way and i i
[31:01] don't know how many times a day or
[31:03] during the day you have to take
[31:05] and realize here where your thoughts are
[31:06] taking you and grab a hold of them
[31:08] and bring them back to the word of god
[31:11] because you know our thoughts
[31:12] you know they're they're they're human
[31:14] they're we're human and so
[31:16] there's only one place in this time that
[31:18] we're in and it seems like
[31:20] all hell is against us and it is and it
[31:22] seems like it's getting worse and it is
[31:24] it seems like
[31:25] you know it's getting darker and it is
[31:28] there's things that are going on in this
[31:29] atmospheres and
[31:31] and i mean it's not nothing that we're
[31:32] going through or have went through in
[31:34] this last few weeks or this year
[31:36] has surprised god god knows all about it
[31:39] he's already
[31:40] he pre-planned this he allowed it to
[31:42] come to the place
[31:43] that it is and whether it be the
[31:45] political climate or
[31:46] or the spiritual climate it's all been
[31:49] orchestrated by god we must
[31:51] never forget god has never lost control
[31:54] he's always in control of every
[31:56] situation whether it be
[31:57] our own personal struggle or your own
[31:59] personal battle
[32:00] or or or the world and the whole world
[32:02] in general god
[32:04] has never lost control god is in control
[32:07] of every situation
[32:08] amen he know he has put a and the
[32:11] scripture even talks about you know
[32:12] the devil and how he's put a bit in his
[32:15] mouth and he's even in control of the
[32:17] devil the devil is only doing things
[32:19] orchestrating things according to the
[32:21] plan of almighty god
[32:22] and therefore we cannot get our minds on
[32:24] the political things and things in this
[32:26] world
[32:27] and dwell on that because that's not our
[32:29] home and that's not our goal amen
[32:31] amen our goal is leaving here you know
[32:34] what brother branham would talk about
[32:35] this in many places about faults and
[32:37] and bringing the thoughts under
[32:39] subjection to the word of god
[32:41] he said if we could throw ourself
[32:43] completely to god
[32:45] and completely to his will and be lost
[32:48] to our own thoughts
[32:51] be lost let our own thoughts go and let
[32:54] the mind of christ
[32:55] be in us them same operations of the
[32:58] spirit
[32:59] would work through us just as natural
[33:02] things do
[33:03] my amen just as natural you know and
[33:06] he's speaking of you know you think you
[33:07] know you think hand move you know it's
[33:09] moving before even
[33:10] sometimes you know things happen before
[33:12] you even think i'm almost seems like but
[33:14] amen if you think you know i want to
[33:16] walk over here you're beginning to put
[33:17] things in motion
[33:18] and it's just natural it's a natural man
[33:20] human abilities
[33:22] he said but if we can lose ourselves to
[33:24] our own thoughts
[33:25] and let the mind of christ be in you
[33:28] amen in
[33:28] us the operations of the spirit
[33:32] will work through us just as natural
[33:34] things do
[33:35] amen the same things because we were
[33:37] first created for that world
[33:40] we were first created for that purpose
[33:43] to be under the complete control of god
[33:45] the complete
[33:46] rule of god and to the praise of god to
[33:50] live for god
[33:51] that's what our duty is that's who we
[33:53] are that's why we're here upon this
[33:54] earth
[33:55] amen it's not for what we see around us
[33:57] it is for the operation for the purpose
[34:00] the rule
[34:01] and the praise of almighty god amen he
[34:04] says we
[34:04] he said we cannot alter god's word we
[34:07] have to alter
[34:08] our thinking to his thinking
[34:11] amen it's not about altering the word to
[34:14] our thinking we see where that takes man
[34:16] and it gets uh it gets them off in some
[34:18] creed or some dogma why
[34:19] because they altered the word of god
[34:21] instead of altering their thinking to
[34:23] the word of god
[34:24] you know i've used this as actually one
[34:26] one of my first sermons i ever preached
[34:28] was at a goat show
[34:30] and yeah i know that's shocking i
[34:31] understand it was a little devotional on
[34:33] a sunday morning and and they wanted dad
[34:35] to actually speak at it and he
[34:37] he was wanted to be back home for that
[34:39] and so he asked me to do it and i
[34:41] i just kind of looked at him like i'm
[34:42] looking at you now a little bit
[34:44] dumbfounded and i'm like
[34:45] what do you mean speak to him what do
[34:47] you he said you can do it
[34:49] well thanks and so i got to thinking
[34:53] about
[34:53] what to speak to him you know i i was
[34:56] like well i mean i don't even know where
[34:57] to start and so
[34:58] i got to look thinking about something
[35:00] though in the goat world and
[35:01] and there's a something called a score
[35:03] card and when you
[35:04] when you go to uh to be judged by a
[35:07] judge
[35:07] they have to put something that's an
[35:09] ultimate or a absolute so they
[35:11] they print out what would be the perfect
[35:13] goat and so you get so many points for
[35:15] this
[35:16] and so many points for that i won't go
[35:17] into all the details but you get and
[35:19] and it gets up to 100 points so
[35:22] theoretically the judge is he's watching
[35:24] you walk through the ring with your goat
[35:25] he's saying this goat adds up to 94
[35:27] points that was 92 points that went and
[35:30] he places them in lines according to
[35:32] what they are placed according to the
[35:34] scorecard because there has to be an
[35:35] ultimatum or
[35:36] an absolute somewhere amen and so i was
[35:39] talking to them about that and i said
[35:40] you know many times many breeders
[35:42] try to change the scorecard to match
[35:45] their goat instead of
[35:46] breeding the goat to match the scorecard
[35:48] and i said it's the same thing with the
[35:50] bible
[35:51] amen people have taken the word of god
[35:53] and they try to change the word of god
[35:55] to match them instead of changing this
[35:57] to match the word of god
[35:59] and the devil is always wanting to do
[36:00] that he's always wanting to make you
[36:02] think well
[36:03] that's your thoughts or you know maybe
[36:04] that's what god thinks about you
[36:06] but that it ain't what you think about
[36:08] yourself or what comes through this
[36:10] brain
[36:10] it's what god thought about you it's
[36:13] what the word of god says and you have
[36:15] to stand upon that word
[36:16] no matter what happens amen so we have
[36:19] to alter
[36:20] our thinking to his thinking
[36:23] amen if our thoughts over depression we
[36:25] have to think what he thinks
[36:27] the joy of the lord is our strength if
[36:29] our thoughts are of sickness we have to
[36:31] think what he thinks
[36:32] by his stripes i'm healed this is his
[36:35] thoughts it's the word written
[36:37] these are the eternal thoughts of
[36:39] almighty god written down on paper they
[36:41] cannot change
[36:42] they cannot fail they are there they are
[36:44] the absolute to stand upon
[36:46] in uncertain times amen that when all
[36:49] hell is against you
[36:50] you have something firm to stand upon
[36:52] that's the only thing there is
[36:54] this church is not firm enough this uh
[36:56] this world is not firm enough there's
[36:58] nothing in government's helps it's firm
[37:00] enough
[37:01] there's only one thing that can hold a
[37:03] believer in this tower
[37:04] that is the word of god hallelujah
[37:08] so when you when you when you do that
[37:09] you let the mind of christ come into you
[37:12] then you'll think like he thinks
[37:16] hallelujah he said when you come to
[37:18] total obedience is another
[37:20] place he said then you can have
[37:21] possession when you obey he said you've
[37:24] got to
[37:24] fully surrender your own thoughts
[37:28] your own will your own mind and let the
[37:31] mind of christ
[37:32] operate in you he said now do you think
[37:34] the mind of christ and you would say the
[37:36] days of miracles are passed no way
[37:38] do you think the mind of christ and you
[37:40] would say the bible's right in some
[37:41] places
[37:42] and not in others no way the mind of
[37:44] christ will
[37:45] sanction every word that christ ever
[37:48] said
[37:49] so if you don't use your own mind just
[37:52] use his mind
[37:54] hallelujah you know what we've got these
[37:56] five senses and this cta smell
[37:58] fill in here and i know with the
[38:00] coronavirus you only had about three of
[38:02] them for a while
[38:02] but you know they come back sooner or
[38:04] later but you know we got five senses
[38:06] and these five senses are not
[38:08] they're not given to you to access this
[38:11] the five senses are only given to you to
[38:14] access the world or the natural world
[38:15] around you
[38:16] amen you see taste feel smell or hear
[38:19] they're okay
[38:20] but don't trust them unless they agree
[38:24] with the word hallelujah
[38:27] if they agree with the word then fine
[38:30] they're all right but if they disagree
[38:31] with the word
[38:32] don't listen to them hallelujah
[38:36] amen imaginations conscience memories
[38:38] reasons affection
[38:39] they're all right as long as they agree
[38:42] with the word
[38:42] but if they don't agree with the word
[38:44] don't trust them
[38:46] hallelujah amen if you're affection
[38:49] don't agree with the word get rid of it
[38:51] if you reason and disagrees with the
[38:52] word get rid of it if your thoughts
[38:55] disagree with your imagination disagree
[38:57] if your conscience disagree get rid of
[38:59] it
[39:02] amen there's only one thing to lean upon
[39:04] and stand upon and that's the word of
[39:06] god
[39:06] i'm going to drive this point home
[39:08] tonight there's only one thing in this
[39:10] time
[39:10] that we're living in you can stand upon
[39:12] is the word of god
[39:21] just this past week you know it does
[39:24] something to a man when you get three
[39:26] three nights during the week you're
[39:28] woken up with emergency situations
[39:31] your wife's calling you and telling you
[39:33] she can't breathe and your oxygen is
[39:36] falling and falling
[39:37] and the devil's putting all kinds of
[39:38] thoughts in your mind
[39:40] trying to tell you all kinds of things
[39:43] take you way down the road somewhere
[39:46] constantly having to bring those
[39:48] thoughts back and say no by his stripes
[39:50] she's healed
[39:52] no by his stripes she's healed no by his
[39:55] stripes she's healed
[39:57] amen it was constant night after night
[40:00] after night
[40:01] by his stripes she's healed
[40:04] it's the only thing you can do in this
[40:05] hour listen amen if you go by what you
[40:08] think and then it'll take you down a
[40:09] long dark road somewhere
[40:11] and drop you off somewhere but if you'll
[40:13] bring it back to the word of god
[40:15] and say no devil not tonight satan
[40:19] not today satan by his stripes
[40:22] she's healed
[40:27] amen when god can get a man in his hands
[40:30] well who wants to be in his hands to
[40:33] where he can get the senses and the
[40:35] conscience and the affections and the
[40:36] reasons
[40:37] and everything cleaned out until it
[40:39] stands
[40:40] with god in the spirit
[40:44] there's not a devil in the world that
[40:46] can poke a doubt in right there
[40:48] he'll come around saying you don't feel
[40:49] no better has nothing to do with how i
[40:52] feel devil it only has to do with the
[40:54] word of god
[40:59] your conscience will be gone and that
[41:02] flu that channel between you and god be
[41:04] clear
[41:05] and all of a sudden a shout come out
[41:07] hallelujah
[41:10] don't god save me yet i'll trust him
[41:14] this is exactly could you imagine the
[41:15] mind battles and
[41:17] and the reasonings and the imaginations
[41:19] that job had
[41:22] i mean there's a children gone
[41:24] everything he had gone in just a few
[41:26] moments
[41:27] it's all gone and he's now broke out and
[41:29] boiled sitting on the ash sheep
[41:31] and his wife saying why don't you just
[41:32] curse god and die
[41:35] you need to say it and i no doubt yeah
[41:37] listen it wasn't like he didn't have a
[41:39] mind battle he was human he had mind
[41:41] battles
[41:42] he had all kinds of things going through
[41:43] his mind as he scraped off them bowls
[41:46] and he went through it night after night
[41:48] and day after day and time after time
[41:50] and he's going through his mind what did
[41:51] i do wrong
[41:52] i must have did something wrong i must
[41:55] have said no i have a sacrifice
[41:58] oh hallelujah i've been down that road
[42:01] the devil tried to take me there
[42:02] when my little boy andrew was born and
[42:05] he couldn't breathe he
[42:06] immediately brought to my mind you must
[42:08] have sinned
[42:10] he must have done something wrong but
[42:11] god reminded me no you've got a
[42:13] sacrifice
[42:15] hallelujah and the blood has been paid
[42:18] for that little boy's healing
[42:19] this will be nothing but a testimony and
[42:22] it's a testimony today
[42:23] of god's healing grace
[42:30] hallelujah he said all of a sudden when
[42:33] all those things begin to clear out
[42:36] a hallelujah break forth i'm ready to
[42:38] hear some hallelujahs
[42:39] and some glory to gods and it'll shine
[42:42] out why
[42:43] the word of god is working through there
[42:45] in the power of god to back it up
[42:47] but it's a battleground it's a place the
[42:50] devil's got to come in the mind
[42:52] the mind is the gate to the spirit and
[42:55] he attacks the mind to get to the spirit
[42:57] and the next thing you know the spirit
[42:59] that once was elevated is now
[43:00] cast down and turned to inward thoughts
[43:04] and
[43:04] and thoughts of suicide and thoughts of
[43:07] unbelief and thought
[43:08] and right that doesn't mean the soul is
[43:10] not still saved
[43:13] it's the devil's thoughts
[43:17] let's just put it back where it belongs
[43:19] the thoughts you had this week that you
[43:21] ain't gonna make it that ain't your
[43:22] thoughts
[43:23] that's the devil's thoughts the thoughts
[43:27] of of saying you ain't born again that
[43:29] ain't your thoughts
[43:30] that's the devil's thoughts the thoughts
[43:32] of saying you can't be
[43:34] saved that's not your thoughts or you
[43:36] can't be healed that's not your thoughts
[43:38] that's the devil's thoughts but tonight
[43:40] we're turning away from all those things
[43:42] and we're looking to the word of god
[43:44] what does he think about the situation
[43:46] brother aaron god thinks you're healing
[43:48] his thinking says you're healed
[43:51] amen his thoughts says you're delivered
[43:54] his thought says you're free
[43:56] his thought says there's no more change
[43:58] there's no more bondage there's no more
[44:00] devil this is his thoughts
[44:06] it's your battleground though it's a war
[44:09] the greatest battle ever fought
[44:12] be a good one to go listen to about
[44:13] right now
[44:16] your mind opens up it accepts the spirit
[44:18] or it rejects the spirit
[44:21] right here you can
[44:24] have little consciences and little
[44:26] feelings and little sensations
[44:27] all those things nothing to do with it
[44:29] just a little sensation
[44:30] but when it comes to reality your mind
[44:32] opens up and your mind will either
[44:35] accept it or
[44:36] reject it and he makes a statement
[44:39] god let none of them miss this
[44:44] it's right here
[44:47] if he can turn your thoughts to dying
[44:51] and depression you'll go down down down
[44:54] down
[44:56] you can go from a healthy person right
[44:58] down into the grave
[45:02] it's your mind that opens up the door or
[45:04] closes the door
[45:06] and it and listens to your conscience
[45:08] listens to your memories
[45:09] listen to your affection but when your
[45:11] mind closes itself
[45:12] off to those things and let god the
[45:15] spirit of his word come in
[45:17] it blows the rest of the stuff out every
[45:20] doubt is gone every fear is gone every
[45:22] sensation of doubt is gone
[45:24] every feeling is gone there's nothing
[45:25] standing there but the word of god
[45:28] and satan cannot battle against that
[45:32] hallelujah that's what jesus showed us
[45:34] there when he came against him he said
[45:36] it is written
[45:37] it is written it is written it wasn't
[45:40] what he thought it was what was
[45:45] he wrote him back to the word of god
[45:50] you know we know that battle has raged
[45:53] since eden
[45:54] it's where it started in the battle of
[45:56] the human mind satan started it
[45:59] when he did what he did to him to eve
[46:02] and he put a thought there the brandon
[46:04] would call it he said he would stop with
[46:06] the channel by just whitewashing it a
[46:08] little bit
[46:10] what he will do with your thoughts is
[46:12] maybe not tell you you're not going to
[46:14] be
[46:14] saved or not going to be healed you're
[46:16] just not going to be saved or healed
[46:18] tonight
[46:21] whitewash it a little bit amen
[46:25] surely you know god you made those words
[46:27] he spoke that but surely
[46:29] that ain't what he means yeah he knew
[46:31] the word was right he knew what he knew
[46:33] god i mean he wasn't stupid
[46:35] even though i called him stupid a lot he
[46:38] pretty smart fella
[46:41] cunning to be honest with you he brought
[46:44] up a good one with this coronavirus
[46:46] just to be honest i mean he's made it to
[46:48] where pastor can't win
[46:52] i know i told we took a left turn but
[46:55] that's exactly right
[46:58] you know it's my ask or no mask is this
[47:00] or that what do we do here and no matter
[47:01] what the pastor decides he can't win
[47:05] amen so what is he doing he's trying to
[47:08] bring this
[47:09] he said it's just like he talks about it
[47:10] you know in this he talks about his mama
[47:12] how
[47:12] she would give her castor oil he'd give
[47:14] her she would give him castor oil i
[47:16] i'm thankful science has advanced past
[47:18] this
[47:20] we talked about that the other day could
[47:22] you imagine having to get bled out they
[47:24] bleed them out can they get a mercy
[47:28] i'm thankful science has progressed even
[47:31] the last six months
[47:35] leave that right there but anyway
[47:38] you see he said they should put a little
[47:40] orange juice in it
[47:42] try to make it go down better he said
[47:44] that was just hypocritical
[47:49] get up in the nighttime she'd give us
[47:50] that stuff for croup and
[47:52] put a little cold oil castor oil put
[47:54] sugar on her something
[47:55] hypocritical he said it just about
[47:57] burned your tonsils out
[47:59] after the sugar was left i ain't never
[48:00] tried it so i don't know and i don't
[48:02] ever plan on tearing
[48:03] but since satan tries to be hypocritical
[48:05] about things
[48:07] he'll give you a little something but
[48:08] he'll sugarcoat it
[48:10] he'll try to make it you know just a
[48:11] little easier more simpler plan more
[48:13] sensible
[48:14] he said there but there's no more
[48:16] sensible plan than what god laid down at
[48:19] the beginning
[48:21] listen i'm not here to give you the mind
