want to say Jesus don't pass me by today we just ministered to me to my heart somehow Lord just come to my pew and speak to me Lord and in a very special way Lord Jesus as we bow before your throne we know it's a throne we find favor grace in our time of need Lord we have to confess we're needy we have to confess that we're weak on our own Lord that we cannot do it but because of you Lord you're our strength giver you're are encouraging you're the one Lord that we can draw from today no you never fail us we ask Lord that you'll just bless us today in your presence there are many needs that your people have situations in their heart and life Lord hands that went lifted up to you and said Jesus don't pass me by I pray God that you'll meet those needs bring healing to the sick there's so many requests this morning that we ran across the desk and Lord we just we just add to it Lord our faith as we bring every request to your throne asking God for healing for those that are sick salvation for those that are lost Oh God for the needs to be supplied in your children fathered there are those here today they can't go back to the same Lord their their situation is so so great and I pray Lord that in your presence they'll be changed Lord that the Holy Spirit and just do its work and I'm here Lord just as your servant I can do nothing without you Lord they the thoughts that I have and the fragments of the house are just like pages scattered upon the sea but all if the Holy Spirit will just come and gather those thoughts and speak them by his inspiration then lives will be changed and your presence forever I prayed today Lord you'll do it for your children those across the land those listening on the internet those that are are in need everywhere Lord you're the you're the Great God that understands humanity it's because you became one of us and tasted what we have to go through Lord so that you could be a perfect mediator that we could know when we come to you you understand that you're not just a distant Spirit God who could not understand what it means to suffer and then to bear the weight of sin and transgression but Lord you became one of us and took on our sins but Lord that's not the end of the story we have become your righteousness and Lord because of your blood we're perfected and we know Lord we're asking great things today that you'll do the exceeding abundantly above that which we're able to think are asked now as we commit the service to you in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you turned with me to numbers chapter 33 and verse 53 we're going to read this verse the scripture again and then also st. John 15:7 we're going to visit that scripture again as we just look into the Word of God I want to speak today on the land of his abiding presence and we have been talking about coming into the land of our inheritance and the in this land is his abiding presence a man we want to speak about that today verse 53 numbers chapter 33 and ye shall dispossessed the inhabitants of Zion and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it and then John 15:7 John 15:7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples amen god bless you you can be seated as we look into our subject today and we we want to make everyone feel welcome and a part of the service today we're really happy for you to be here with us the different ones that have gathered with us I have special family members that are here nieces and nephews and so on that are here with us today that we're just really happy to have with us pray God's blessings upon you and all of you that has assembled with us no matter where you're from Jesus knows you amen and he cares amen we're just really happy to have you and and to be with us we have also sister canvases grandparents brother Danny and sister Vicky Ward's so we're happy to have them with us today and just pray that the Lord will bless them in a mighty way and you hear that assembled with us all of the home folks so glad you're here today amen I'm glad to be here and I'm glad Jesus is here we've already felt his presence we've welcomed him with a words of our song as we sang to him and worship Him and now we just want to let him speak to us through the word now so as I said we're gonna be speaking on the land of the above in presence and this is so important because we're where we have arrived in this day and our is is not just a time where we're that the Spirit of God will depart and leave from us but it is the promise of a comforter that abides with us forever now Jesus our Joshua our who is Jehovah's Saviour actually his name in the the Greek is actually Yeshua are the Hebrew and it is the same word as Yeshua that led the children of Israel in their promised land and our Yahshua or Joshua or Jesus as said in the Greek has brought us from the law into this land of the Holy Ghost and I wouldn't say it's a land flowing of milk and honey a man now like Egypt was to Israel the law was bondage and it kept men slaves to sin because it had nothing that would deliver men from sins clutches it only showed that men were sinners but it did nothing to deliver them the sacrifice that they had was that a blood and bulls and goats and it was weak in that it could not atone for sin because the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sin neither could it replace in nature with the nature of an innocent sacrifice so it only showed that men were sinners and did nothing to deliver them now Jesus as our forerunner would actually be come the head of a new race because Adams race has fallen and and of course in the Adam's race all men die and so we were sceptic unto death and to separation from God from our first birth and Jesus as a forerunner though would be the first to hitter in this new land and he would be the first the new creation and upon him the spirit would come to abide now if you'll look with me to John chapter 1 verse 32 the Bible said that John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descended from heaven like a dove and hid a boat upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said it said unto me of whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost so we see that Jesus had been prophesied actually in the scripture and John actually would be quickened by the Holy Ghost and let me know that it would be one the one that would be the Messiah would be the one you see the Spirit descend upon but not just a sin but that he would remain on him and of course this would set him apart from all of the Old Testament prophets because of the Old Testament prophets the Spirit of God would would come upon them and they would prophesy and the Spirit of God would leave but if I'm Jesus the Spirit of God would remain and notice that he would be a vessel that the Holy Ghost would not just come upon for a season or for a prophecy and then leave but a man that the Spirit of God would abide in and remain this is prophesied in the scripture and Isaiah chapter 11 verse 1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spear of the Lord shall rest and this word means settle down and remain upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might and the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord chapter 42 of Isaiah Isaiah chapter a verse 1 says behold my servant whom I was hold my life in my and whom my soul delighteth I have not put my spirit upon him and he shall bring for judgment to the Gentiles and of course then we remember the one that Jesus referred to himself in Isaiah 61 and 1 the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound so Jesus was a man who had the spirit but not as the Old Testament prophets had the spirit the Old Testament prophets were and men and women they were certainly anointed and and even spoke of it being filled with the spirit but never had they the spirit to come down and abide or to dwell in man as it did in Jesus none of the Old Testament prophets nor shall I say the New Testaments disciples had the spirits indwelling before Pentecost we will look in John chapter 7 38 for our reference here he that believeth on me as the Scriptures said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this he spake of the Spirit which day that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified so we see it would take his death burial and resurrection and ascension and his glorification in order for the Holy Ghost to come back and to end well man and this would of course be the start of a new race not another Hebrew race not of the lineage of abraham's natural scene but the lineage of abraham's face seed and this would be a new race that would not be just human but they would be born again and it would be born of the god reigns now even as John the greatest prophet of all set I can only baptize you with water but there is one that is coming after me he's got a greater baptism than I did and when he comes he is going to be the Holy Ghost Baptizer and and he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost in other words he was share with you he is all my life a man that the life of this Lamb of God would be different from the other lambs that would represent him that would substitute for man's sin until he came but he would be different and that is he would share his own life that the life and the nature of the sacrifice would actually come and dwell in the worshiper now in Luke chapter 3 verse 16 John answered saying unto them all I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I cometh the lachen of whose shoes I'm not worthy to unloose and he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire so I want you to notice this one would come with baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire we'll talk about that a little moment but in a moment but let's also go to Jesus words in John our Acts chapter 1 and verse 4 and being a symbol together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which said he you have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence so how different this anointing would be from the anointing on the Old Testament believer their anointing came and went but this anointing would abide with you forever and man it would be more than just a presence come down upon you and you rejoice in it you prophesy in it you heal the sick in it and then it leaves you and you fall back into temptation but this would be one that would abide with you he would actually well in you and you would be one hallelujah and you would become the manifestation of the Father's will now John chapter SIV 14 verse 16 it says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter now Jesus was a comforter you can imagine as he went along you know he was certainly Mary and Martha's comforter when he come there to the tomb of Lazarus he was a comforter for the widow at name he was he was he was a comforter of them many who were sick and healed he was a comforter to the disciples who we'll talk about here in a moment we're word that they called for demons to come out of the young Boyd and couldn't cast him out he was definitely a comforter but he said I'm gonna deceive you another comforter that he may abide with you until I'm tempted he will abide with you how long forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not and it neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you a man hallelujah and shall be in you so right now he's dwelling with you my disciples but in that day he will be in you and there's going to be a vast difference between one who is dwelling with you and somebody toiling in you remember calls the disciples can go away without Jesus and they can get on a boat without Jesus and they could brainstorms without Jesus hallelujah but wouldn't you get this comforter he's there and every stone he's there in every situation first John chapter 2 verse 27 he explains that the anointing which you have received abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and his truth and is no lie and even as it had taught you ye shall abide in him so now we see this anointing bided in you and he says he would be the inside teacher now this doesn't replace or do away with the necessity of the faithful ministry of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors but rather you know he's there when the pastor isn't there man he's there when the - when that teacher isn't there that has taught you the concepts of the gospel he is there inside teacher who is showing you the way who is directing your path who is showing you where to place your feet the inside teacher he'll convince you of sin now this what this Holy Ghost would that was promised that would come he would not leave them no no not an hour of temptation it would keep them in a box but the Holy Ghost says is not something really that you keep and man it keeps you a lot of times we say Lord you know I can just hold barely hold on well really you know if it's him it ain't you holding on anymore anyhow a man today you got a hold of him miss got him got a hold of you and there's a whole lot of difference we got in temptation because you are weak your flesh is weak your willpower is weak Amen but there is an inside dwelling of the Holy Ghost that will keep you in your hour of temptation now let's just see what happened to man as we explained as we go to this because as I said this is a land is certainly flowing with milk and honey it's rich is one that mankind had never experienced before the land of the Holy Ghost the land of the new creation is the land of his abiding presence it's the land where only God men dwell hallelujah it's the land of the Spirit and nobody knows what it is except those who have been there it's kind of like the boy with Apple you know was standing there listening to an atheist going back and forth on and argued with others about whether that was a god and by me the little boy got enough of it and he just sent her chewing on an apple and he said Amen said tell me can this Apple is this Apple sweeter sour he said god I know you're the one eating and he said that's what I thought Amen people want to tell you what the Holy Ghost is I want to tell you what I can or can't do or whether sweet or sour they don't know you know the sweetness up you know the power up you have the assurance of it you know that you know you and let you know the Bible says and that day you shall know that I'm in the father the father in me and I in you you're not imagining that you're there you're there but let's go back in for a moment to Genesis and there are thinking and let's go back see what happened to man Adam was made first a spirit million this is why the confusion seems would be with Genesis chapter 1 and 2 is because in Genesis 1 Adam is created of God in Genesis 2 his body is formed so what is a creation 1 is a formation and so God God first of all God is a spirit and he made man in the image of God so he was first spirit man we're done about the the first Adam and God made man in his spirit he made him in his in but in his body as you know he had attributes of the earth and and there was you know he had hair like a mammal he he had different other other identities that identified him with the earth his see taste smell smell feeling here all contacted the earthly realm but originally he was he was spirit man and then God would place that spirit that he had created in a body that he had formed and now there would be a man that could till the soil a man because he was not going to do it in spirit he was going to do it as man so you see within him Adam was actually different from the rest of God's creation because here Adam had a spirit made by God and this and it had within him the ability to be filled with God's Spirit now that's and of course that what makes him difference between man and animal is that man that God made had a soul and that soul is the choice chamber it accepts or rejects the spirit now the animal doesn't do that it has no soul it makes no choice but a man is made in God's image because God didn't want him just to be a robot God wanted him to be able to make a choice between life and death as to what nature would in fill him so now as we look at it Adam was major place to be filled his his heart was to be surrendered to God so God could dwell in him but before he made Surrender Adams surrendered his soul and therefore the soul of every one of his offspring to be filled with and ruled by sin nature and so yet every one of us you know every one of us as Adam as Adams rates we still have the ability of self wheels that we can surrender our soul to God and our we could surrender it to sin nature you see in other words sin nature can be overthrown and we can become the chip or the dwelling place of the Living God so that's the Bible said by one man's obedience speaking of Jesus that every one of his offsprings are to be filled with divine nature and all because of Adam's disobedience every man of his Osprey of his is born with sin nature for it says in Romans 5:17 for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ so by one man's offense we were all born in sin but by one man's obedience by one man's obedience we reign in righteousness in one man's disobedience we are obedient to sin we are slaves of sin but in one man's obedience we are now free from sin I remember no longer slaves who I would sometimes the church could you're in rhythm it's slave mentality I realize I'm not a slave to singing a man it has no control over me I don't belong to the devil a mother's God's before the foundation of the world my choice didn't make me God's his choice made me his he knew who I was before the world ever began and if I ordained my comin hallelujah and though I was born in sin he said I've got a remedy for the Bible said in Colossians 1:13 that he have delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom are the rule of his dear son let's put the devil on notice we don't belong to him this kingdom we're in Satan has no right to aim at displaces the only man and woman back again like Adam and Eve were before the two trees in Eden one a tree of life one a tree of death and we can choose between life or death now in your first birth you did not choose to be born with sin nature you were born with sin heaven rule over you because Adam sold his offspring his self he suited the whole human race to Satan David would say that's in sin did my mother conceive me and I was shapen in iniquity I was brought in the world speaking lies as a combination about three sons but it's all the same a man that this is what happened man was born in a depraved sinful condition this is why the Bible would say all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God but however every man at some point is brought before the Tree of Life and some manner and that tree of life of course is Jesus Christ and and they choose between remaining under sins rule or whether to surrender their soul to God now understand predestination and I'm not I'm not arguing that the thought of predestination and God's choice over your choice I'm saying is God God even in his foreknowledge new-year choice a man and you choose because you were here that's why you choose it's why you choose life because you were here there's something in you that calls back out to Almighty God but notice that again you stand there every man and woman they either receive or turn down eternal life in fact of the matter is brother Branham would say that every sinner fights his way to hell hey ma'am and the Bible said it's not his will that any should perish right he don't want anybody lost he don't why he don't want anybody lost and all this says just settle a question for you right now there won't be one of his children in hell hell was not created for his children hell was created for the devil and his angels a mouth but then you know let me share a couple of the quotations as we go along when you come to total obedience then you can have possession but until you totally obey you got it totally or completely surrender your own thoughts your own wield your own mind and let the mind of Christ operate in you again he would say when you fully surrender he'll come in fully but until you surrender he can't come in fully surrender surrender your thoughts surrender your thinking surrender your life surrender your all surrender your prestige surrender everything to him now and he'll come in and fill you with the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you the problem every time when people lack the Holy Spirit in their life after asking God for it is comes right back to this one thing of full surrender the lack thereof in the Old Testament the atonement was limited because it is only the blood are there of an animal and the NSE of the nature of the animal sacrificed could not enter into the worshipper fine because it had no soul amen but under this atonement of the Lamb Jesus Christ here we come back to this by baptism of fire come on by baptism of fire a latter case sin nature and replaces dead all nature with the very life and the nature of God sealing you with God and seasons Satan our that's why if you willfully surrender to the Holy Spirit allow him to sanctified you fully and be sealed by his spirit you will never fall now brother branham would use the virtues in in 2nd Peter 1 to show that a person who has believed on the Lord and started with the foundation of faith that he must add these virtues through sanctification and even be kept off with divine love of God which is the Holy Ghost and Peter concludes by saying if you like these virtues you're blind and you've forgot what the Bloodless to do for you but if you allow the holy good the Holy Spirit to sanctify and cleanse out the old sin nature and then filled you then you will never fall a man how many wants to be in that place that no matter what storm of life no matter what kind of gossip among the leaf comes by no matter what persuasion or somebody was a better argument and that nothing ever can separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 9 but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sin wherefore the rather brother give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall what state to be what a place of security oh my what a place to be sealed away to your destination now before Jesus came men had the Holy Spirit as their anointing some were anointed with it actually said cells they were filled with the spirit and yet as filled as they were two they would prophesy and and foretell and see visions and and even work miracles they were not sealed the Holy Spirit would come upon them and they would leave and for example for this just as you can be baptized and fully immersed in water and not one drop of water get into your body so can a person be baptized with the Holy Ghost upon their spirit and they jump in the shower and dance and speak in tongues and prophesy and work miracles and have healing and signs and wonders and still have sin nature within their soul and on the other hand you might be a sealed son or daughter of God and never perform a miracle and that doesn't mean you're not sealed for those things are unknown believers man now in the Old Testament and even in the new Claude we'll give people certain gifts and these gifts are given without repentance in other words many of many times if they're men and women are born with them and and they haven't even repented and so that without repentance and these gifts again you know can come under the anointing and God can use them and the old testament men would be gifted by the by God to fight I mean would be mighty warriors that the spear the Lord would move upon them and they would defeat the enemies of Sian and subdue them because of the Spirit and the anointing of God upon them and they would yield that give to God and use that gift to deliver God's people and there were there's gifted men like Moses or sense and or Saul and David that we can use as examples were thus appear the Lord would come on them and yet in the hour of temptation they would he yielded him tation and sin and God would withdraw his presence from them because he only had one birth under the Old Testament and there was no way they could ever be born out of sins Dominion so no matter how they were born a seed of Abraham and no matter how annoying did they become that days to were under sins dominions when Moses was tempted to show off earnings and then exalt himself the spirit lifted and the tempter one a month this very thing would keep him out of the promised land when the Balaam was tempted with money imposition the spirit left and the tempter once when Samson was tempted with pretty Philistine women the tempter was and the spirit departed Sampson was a gifted man he had a super strength that didn't compromise human abilities much different what we visualized some big atlas with muscles and tall and strong and all of this he was a little wimp maybe a little sissies boy with seven locks representing his covenant with God but he was gifted and man he was gifted though he was just a little scrawny boy yet he was gifted so that he can heal himself to God and the Spirit of the Lord but come upon him and empower him so much that when he met a life the Bible said the spear the Lord came upon him and he took that lion and he ripped him apart and she would a little a little goat kid Simpson would give his trick to God but he would never give God his heart in his heart was adultery and fornication and his heart was compromised in his heart was a desire to go down to the the Philistine daughters and compromise God's Word and and he would get in a dilemma and the Spirit the Lord would come upon Samson and he would surrender his faith in his gift and his faith was the deposit was in the deposit of his gift that God had placed within him and he would perform supernatural acts and he would have tremendous victories you know people do this you see you means even today because many of them never come into the new land are still outside I can hear brother branham preach and he said Oh God that my church would come over into this land of the Holy Ghost it was his desire but some people will give their their ability to God their ability like of singing they will give God that ability they're gifted their knowing it is saying maybe maybe comes down their family line there daddy their mother somebody or maybe you know it's like some of the horses that race then nobody in their pedigree that was any good and he's a fluke and some diamonds and genetics it skips generations as you know if there's anything and then my family I didn't get it Julie is doing my singing for me but yet you see these are gifted and anointed to sing and and some can have sinful habits maybe just yesterday that were watching pornography or even fornicating with their boyfriend or girlfriend and they feel terrible about it they feel guilty about it and yep they're shamed and when they get up to sing in church you know all they know is when they get up to saying people are so blessed and people come to them after the service and say you don't have a super nest by your ministry of singing and I was going through such a terrible trial and a hard time and God use me to hell to use you to help me and it's so bless me you know what that does it encourages him to keep on going the way they are you know I felt I didn't know anyone I must be alright you know I sung the songs of silent Wow even brother Jim got up and shouted and yet living in sin a person can be so annoying to preach and yet be living in adultery while he's preaching I said just last night was with a prostitute and yet up to preach and get so anointed by the spirit that others get delivered gasp even demons are cast out or a miracle is performed and this is why when canvases ylim it was an office of the high priests that while he was condemning Jesus to death and demanded he be crucified he prophesized by the spirit hey man this is this is in John 11 verse 51 and you can see it this big not even a cell but as high priest that year he prophesied can you imagine here he's in the throws and the very gentleman and he's condemning Jesus Christ and sending him to a cross to be crucified and he prophesized under the spirit this is why Jesus said in Matthew 7:21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven and you wonder what that will is I'll tell you is repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the Father's will oh man so it's not everyone that says send to me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom but those who comes back repentance surrender the reason again anew in Christ many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out Devils in my name have done many wonderful works and then I will confess to them I never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity and yet they have prophesied yet they have cast out devils yet they have done wonderful works and yet had never come to that obedience now why because although anointed they were never surrendered to the will of the Father to be sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise let's look at Balaam de cemento moment in numbers 24 - and Balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the Spirit of God came upon him now that he will prophesy and he will actually prophesied something that will come to pass that will lose that would be a prophecy of the Messiah a horn were raised up out of Jesse you know that will raise them out of Israel and our Jacob rather and here as it raises up a prophecy of the Messiah to come by the spirit but you see this is what made Balaam of false prophet because although he surrendered his gift to God to prophesy accurately he loved the wages of unrighteousness and used the error of his doctrine to cause Israel to fall by sea and we're all one and the Israelite son took the daughters of Moab and committed whoredom and Balaam worked it around to get God to smite them so he was able to do what he was hired to do when he could not get God to curse them he made them follow by false doctrine the Bible calls it the doctrine of balaam and the doctrine of Balaam was we're all one hey ma'am and so you know what he did that he would he would he actually looked there and he said hey we're all one you know this is what children this is Abraham's children we're all one you know get in there and worship together knowing that in their worship they mix fornication and now that would be taken in the strange daughters of lot who were under a curse and in this God would have to curse them can you imagine that so Balaam works it around to his doctor to get them cursed yet he can be anointed by the spirit and prophesy don't you understand this is why there's a great deception in the last day Mathew 24:24 word that there will arise false prophets who are anointed wasn't in you an anointing and bring a deceiving spirit now think about it truly it would come and it would leave them this Holy Spirit would come it would leave them but they could not be sealed it would not abide with him forever another notable example is that of Saul who was in mourning because of his rebellious spirit and his disobedience the spirit left him and instead an evil spirit came upon him you see Saul was a king that the Spirit of God came upon him the side you know anything about the Old Testament the Bible said that saw prophesied with the prophets and the spear the Lord came upon him and yet because of his rebellious disobedient Lord but depart from the saw an evil spirit would trouble him in verse Samuel 16 verse 14 the spear Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him in other words permitted by God God permitted and an evil spirit to trouble him and they would call for a man with who was coming with the heart and it was David and he played for Saul during the time of his insanity and the evil spirit would lift for him from him for a while he'd be okay for a little bit and go out and fight the Lord's battles and come under such an anointing remember but I want you to know that then because of disobedience we're caught with establish his kingdom forever to be on the throne of Israel but the cause of his disobedience God rejected him hey man now David was a man also who despair the Lord came upon we look upon David very favorably because he was a man after God's own heart David was a man who unlike Saul he was always willing to for to repent a man the Bible said in 1st Samuel 1613 Samuel took a horrible oil and anointed him in the midst of his brother and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward and and then he would David would come oh my he would become the anointed songwriter and he would sing and worship but governors such that we see reduce arms to this day and they're absolutely anointed words of God hey man he would get so under the anointing then he would actually even speak in the first person of Christ and he would prophesy as though he were Christ himself and saved my bones my bones they stank me you know they today they have wounded my hands and my feet all the other different prophesied you know you know what they are laying in the scripture that Campbell over my garments oh no no no he would prophesy in the very first person of Christ David would say had his closing days in 2nd samuel 23:2 the spear the lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue and we can attest to that today right hey man the spear the Lord's paid by him and his words was in my tongue and David would get under the spirits I said and prophesy in the spirit even accurately described the scenes of Calvary and what Jesus would go through you can hear him no groaning when he sinned with Bathsheba did an awful thing and killed her husband in the Psalms he's repenting in some 5110 he would say clear created me a clean heart O God and renew a right spirit in me and cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me because he knew he knew that when they're 19 left saw that he was a haunted by a demon and he didn't want to be a doctor addition so he cried out take the spirit from David was a predestinated see he was a prophet as a seed of God brother Branham would say unspoken words original seed he lacked the rain of the moisture of the spirit to quicken the seed but yet it always just cried out I want to do right I want to live right I want to overcome Oh created me a clean heart I can't live right there was nothing under the blood of bulls and goats and could give him a new nature he was the same oh boy after spirit left him as he was when the Spirit came down he would come to the anointing and accurately prophesy as a just had get under the spirit my bones they stirred me they pierce my hands my feet they pierce my thigh they beiieve it gets under inspiration he'd actually prophesy exactly as what Jesus Christ the Son of David would do but he had nothing to hold him in the hour of temptation I want you say today it'd be awesome wouldn't it to have the Spirit of God that comes in such a manner where you proper sign your words are even written in the Bible and your words become the Holy Scripture and your words are fulfilled in Jesus Christ but how much greater is it that deity comes on the inside of your soul and gives you overcoming power how much greater is that David knew you know or he did everything he knew to do as an Israelite here or fringes with a ribbon of blue all over his garments and he would look upon those and remember all of the commandments of the Lord and Dude him and say you know that day he was commanded to do this this is what all Israelites dress like every one of them would have this ribbon of blue there was me waved or woven through the fringes of their garments so that as he as God said that all of the commensal of the Lord that you'll remember and do them and that you seek not after your own heart in your own eyes after which you used to go a hurry so he says you know I look on this remember this I want to remind you it's in your garments it's a it's a lace of a blue ribbon all the way through to remind you there were things that were that they bound about as a sign of on their hands even the Jews today will wrap a cord around their hands and they may they have something between the frontlets of their eyes and Monday they wore wrote the commandments upon the posts of the house and upon the doors and I can imagine David would make vows and he made his promises and he would say thy word so I'm not sin against thee only to go wet around in the hour of temptation this is a danger of psychology you see psychology is not a nature change it is a learned behavior we train our behavior to do certain certain things that are not acceptable in society using the methods of psychology men makes promises that they intend to keep my mom I'm gonna be true to my wife this time I'm you know I've heard him in testimony meetings before in Midlands meetings where men will get up and say well here's how they overcame banoffee I overcame it because of what it was the harm it was doing to my family and I thought about the hurt I thought about the shame I thought about the bad feelings in it that it that it gave me when I did when I view dis pornography and so now when I think about pornography I make myself think about all the bad things that happens the hurt that if proud of my family in my marriage and the shame that it brought upon my church and and everything else I'm worried - let me - but I will gender said that's not overcoming that psychology in the hour of your temptation you forget all about that and you go do it anyway and David's our temptation he would look from his rooftop over at his neighbor's house his neighbor was away fighting Israel's balance and as a king they had forbid him to come into battle because in a battle he'd almost lost his life and said you're too valuable to go in battle anymore you stay at home will lead the battle and there you Uriah was so he was gone away in battle and that in a moment as David stood up on his rooftop looking over the city he sees a woman in her private chambers there who is bathing and as he looks upon her he looked past his River the boo he looked past the fans on his arms he look past the prevalence in his eyes he'll pass the scriptures on his doorpost and he sit for Bathsheba because in his hour there was nothing to hold him well I've memorized the scripture brother Jim I got dwelt on the promises and all of those are good but there must be an indwelling of the Holy Spirit in your life you see Moses as much as he may have desired and one of the Spirit is possession he also was only anointed he would get so anointed by the spirit and uses great gift of faith to exercise dominion over the devil in Egypt and even use the power of creation standing under the blood of bulls and goats use the power of creation to create flies somebody with me man oh my he would bring up frogs island in the blood Crawford flies take his rod and open the Red Sea take that same rod bear hard and and strike the rock and make water come from it yet one day in a temper fit you know I got an idea that that wasn't his first temper fit but during a temper fit he exalted himself when God tells him recently what to do don't speak to the rock now remember it was a type because the rock was only be smitten once representing Christ but you see Moses now with actually he would get so bigoted so in anger that's a people and he said you rev ups water out of this rock penny stock with his rod and nothing happened and he strikes again and nothing happens and he strikes and water comes and God honors it but he says okay Moses you showed yourself down tonight you exalted yourself over my word you took and show power that you were not to display you used your gift in the wrong way to exalt yourself and make yourself seem important and I'll tell you what you're not leading my people into the Promised Land that's bad but it's no different for the New Testament believers but until after Pentecost before Calvary in the coming of the Spirit you can look at the power of the Holy Ghost on the disciples they healed the sick they cast out Devils they man they casted out by the power of God we know that Jesus said it Satan cast out Satan his kingdom divided a man they did it by the power of God during this time Peter received a revelation direct from God yet didn't have the Holy Ghost cuz it wasn't yet given it could not be given until the sacrifice died and the life of the sacrifice came back home the day of Pentecost a man you see it could not come and Tabernacle man and there's a reason for this because God and Satan cannot share the same throne in the heart are you with me he will not sit on the throne with Satan ruling also so the Oh King thin nature has to die see this is what Jesus was talking about another Kingdom coming thy kingdom come where your will will be done where in our flesh is like the word settled in heaven I know I know you know denominational Theory don't want to take you there because they deny the power thereof but I'm trying to tell you friends there is a power in the Holy Ghost where God is creating a god race a man Oh hallelujah and they're not there because they're forced into it you see it must be one or the other you can't go to heaven with sin nature you got to die you got to die out to sin you got to become a new creation and and that is the only way by the power of the Holy Ghost otherwise you're going to be a failure and you will find yourself at the time of rapture a failure now Judas believed on Jesus for a time oh yeah Judas Ascenta fide yellow Judas was given authority to cast out Devils Judas healed the sick under the power of the Holy Ghost he preached under the anointing that wasn't just him the rest of the cycles did to Peter did also but both were unconverted Judas betrayed the Lord and I'm just going to say so will you so with you you will betray him at some point without the Holy Ghost because everyone not just some of us everyone must go to Pentecost for the spirit seal because that's where Judas failed he stopped short of the upper room you see before Judas got the upper room before Pentecost he showed his colors and that's what is happening in this day that's why Judas is are showing up now they're showing their colors they never made it to the other room that may have been justified or sanctified and live the good holy life and did fine for time but at some point they're going to betray him it's just there it's it's it's unavoidable unless you get to the upper room hey man let me explain it in this way sanctification can cause the unclean spirit to come out of a person only to return if that house isn't filled with the Holy Ghost and when he comes back oftentimes he comes back with seven others worse than his fair bed than than himself seven other devils and the last state of the man is worse than the first this was Jesus in the very sacred moment in the very sacred moment of Jesus handed him the bread represent in his body think of it he gets down to the last supper he goes right down to the last the great holy gathering of the Passover with Jesus sitting at his table for taking one with the other and in the sacred moment of Jesus handing him the bread represent his body dipped in wine representing his blood Satan enters to him he waits to that moment and energy ho Judas you came so close Peters declaration was that Jesus was the Christ but that didn't bring him salvation that was that was not even a confession that Jesus had died for sin becomes a substitute he knew nothing of that Jesus had not died he was he was not converted he was still a Christ denying Kirsten P preacher until Pentecost yet Peter had a revelation from God that Jesus was the Christ Jesus said my father revealed this to you didn't get you didn't learn this from man's lesson but my father gave you this revelation even the Spirit of God came down and imparted a knowledge of Revelation to Peter that he was the Christ that Jesus was the Christ the Anointed Messiah in fact as I said he didn't have he didn't have the knowledge he's in by everybody with me he didn't have the knowledge even of what Jesus had come he knew nothing of his substitutionary death he knew nothing on the power of the blood he knew nothing Alba the substitutionary death on the cross he know nothing of Jesus as a high priest he don't even see his purpose he just knows he's the Messiah the Christ the Son of the Living God and yet when Jesus tried to tell him how that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and because and and Biggs killed and raised again on the third day Peter begins to rebuke him and Jesus said to Peter get behind me Satan thou art an offence fruit to me for thou savourest not the things that be of God but those things that be of men so can you imagine here under there 19 he says that the crisis of the Living God under a different anointing which Jesus said was Satan speaking he rebukes Jesus for the very reason he has come how is it a man could get a revelation that Jesus is a Christ the Son the Living God and yet also be used to the devil to speak against the plan of God if Peter worked miracles Peter had bold confessions he had revelations that could only come from God and then would be used to the devil to speak against the wheel and the purpose of God as many of these but let's take Martha for a moment Martha is a good woman she had a declaration at the tomb of Lazarus and as powerful as it was confessing that Jesus was the Messiah it didn't save her the nature of her lamb had not come into her she declared you a lord I believe that thou art the Christ the Son of God which had come into the world but she knew not see now his purpose his plan and his redemption the woman at the well who said come and see a man didn't bring her full and complete salvation does she recognize him to be the Messiah redemption was not complete until Jesus died on the cross and paid for simms price and rose from the dead and ascended on high and took the role of high priest and just as Aaron the high priest took the blood of the atonement into the presence of the holiest of holies so Jesus would take his own black in through the heavens of heavens were God blouse the matter with me a man in Denny sent back that nature for the blood upon a hundred and twenty men and women in the Upper Room at Pentecost and they were sealed with the sight of Jesus their sacrifice through salvation the others are anointing but you want to be possessed where he abides with you for ever [Music] before this the disciples cast out Devils he did miracles using the authority of Jesus this is why brother Brandon would say in perfect faith he said at first the disciples didn't have this perfect faith they didn't have it because they had Christ walking with Him you see he was he was he was her comforter they knew with him there oh my everything was under control you see they didn't have because they had Christ walking with them so then afterwards Christ was in them so you see it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it and it does now you say the disciples didn't have perfect faith know they had an epileptic child there and they were trying to catch this devil out of him and they couldn't do it until Jesus come and brother branham explains that he said you see if the comforter was dwelling with them but not in them so there they were away from Jesus and there was something there was something their faith dropped their confidence even in their calling their Commission dropped but because when Jesus came he took authority over that thing and said thou evil spirit come out of the man a man but it was impossible you see for them to have the Holy Spirit of body with them at all times because he came and went let's go to this for a moment let's look at an Old Testament prophecy that speaks of the abiding presence Ezekiel 36 25 then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and used to be clean from all your filthiness from your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you that's a new desire I want to do right a new spirit you know a new consciousness of what's right and wrong I will put in you and I would take the stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of flesh and I'll put my spirit within you and look now and he will cause you to do what you couldn't have done on your own he will cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you said well in this land of the Holy Ghost that I have given your father's and ye shall be my people and I will be your God hallelujah don't you want to be his people this morning don't you want for him to be your God a man told chapter 2 verse 28 and it shall come to pass out words that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the hands made and those days will I pour out my spirit oh what a promise that is it in this land there's a pouring out of the Spirit amen in this land the Spirit the Holy Ghost is not just in Jesus it's in you indeed it does not just plow and heav'n deity dwells in you and this land he pours in deep sea vessels who clean herself out presence oh what a promise a man but before the Holy Ghost came men and women could be in dwelled with their body you know they they could not be indwelt by the embodied by biting presence and Spirit of God but you see there would have to come someone because Abraham couldn't impart this abiding presence Samson couldn't impart his anointing to stay with you none of them could give you that Samson could he bad pass it on to his offspring are you with me a member they would have to come another one from this new race would be born and he would be called the firstborn of many brethren hallelujah and his design was to bring many sons unto glory I want you to know it wasn't just Jesus that would have the abiding presence but he decided that he would have sons he would have jars that it is wounding for our transgressions and it's bruising for our iniquity amen and him taking the weapons for peace bruising him he would seek his seed hallelujah through his death so he has a torment they would see a seed that would be a seed I don't know you what am I trying to tell you there's not to be just one Jesus but what they saw what the devil saw that morning in the upper room about the third hour of the day and here come men and women drunken empowered by spirit that he never seen as noisy like this look all different no he doesn't comment [Applause] [Applause] they look like the virgin-born how could this be you see before Pentecost as we've been laboring the spirit was not yet given because it was an atonement needed to cleanse man to clean out the fire baptism to burn outs in nature and it was not yet made it couldn't it was not yet released back to the church and John 7:38 he said he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water this he spake of the Spirit which they that believe should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not glorified so Jesus is saying that's coming forth men and women who when their heart is turned from unbelief to faith then out of their innermost beings there will be rivers rivers of the Spirit gushing out hallelujah God sick bored with life amen and and there would not be an external anointing somebody help me preach now it would not be an external annoying him but the Spirit in dwelling would flower hallelujah it would float I want you to understand it flows it's a river its river to the holy spirit of promise hallelujah amen so that heart of their innermost being with flow love and joy and peace have long suffered goodness and faith but but this would only come from those whose flesh and it's affection and lust are crucified and sin nature dead how could this be how could it be that Adam has a spirit man could not fall until he become flesh he didn't fall in the spirit he fell when it became flesh and then because of his flesh he sinned transgressing God's commandments and so God in his condescending you know and Adam coming from from their the upper realms of the heavens down to the earth that spirit man to earth and come into the flesh God would do the same thing for redemption purposes God would come to sin from the from the heavens of heaven what would be spirit and as spirit he could not suffer in this spirit he could not die and suffer he could not suffer pain he could not be tempted but God would now come and move from that into the oppan II which we call word and through the word he would create all things are you with me a man and then from the oppan II and spirit word he would come in the flesh hallelujah God condescending now into a form that can be tinted can be tried a man can experience the wrong thoughts come on a man can be tempted by the devil's loss and win and win and win this is the captain of our salvation now God had him in himself attributes of Savior healer Redeemer but he couldn't make men fall but he could put man in flesh knowing that he would fall and set me before him as I said God doesn't want us to make us robots where we couldn't be robots if we were in his image a man he didn't want just angels say holy holy holy he wanted men and women who would surrender their own self and come back to him and love him God as we looked as we looked at in the beginning Adam walked by the spirit he ruled by the spirit he moved trees about the spirit but in flesh for him here he had he had the free moral agency or the free willed he could choose death and Eve be called by the serpent who promise you won't surely die she exalted her fleshly desires over God's words and Adam in that moment he he particular the same not being deceived the Bible said but willingly went out of God's presence with her but what this did it didn't change God and man it made God come down in his condescension from tossed to low cost to theophany by which he created all things and become as flesh so he could take on the sins of man hallelujah and this is why the Bible would say greatest mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh and in humans 2 and 9 but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man so God took home flesh so he could pay for men's sins the one without sin took on the dust of the earth and step down into flesh for this God would not borrow timbers from anyone he used not to seed a man nor the egg of a woman he took a virgin girl who knew not a man and overshadowed her with his glory similar to what happened on Mount Transfiguration and the Holy One that was conceived in her was of the Holy Ghost he was not a Jew and he was in a Gentile he was not born of Adam's race if he was he would have been cursed to death and under sins bondage with sin nature already in him but he instead was a brand-new species hallelujah amen forth and from him would come a new race and they would not be the sons of Adam but they would be the sons of God which the bard listen to the scripture was a born not of blood nor the will of flesh nor the will of man but of God brother Branham would describe this and proven his word he said as God came down in this little cell he began to develop cells and drew from his mother's vitamins and then when he become an old enough to eat for himself he began to eat and what was it it was the dust of the earth which he become as he come and went would you come up and plant life in animal life and so forth he began to eat the feasts the bread there's silver they begin to develop cells and then when it was fully matured at thirty years old he was baptized in obedience to John down here or to go to God and rather in the water and went out and what happened the Dove which was God descending from heaven with a voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell see what did he come to do to redeem that part of the earth and he was the beginning of the creation of God because God is not a creation only in Christ he is a creation because God is eternal and the spirit and the spirit cannot be created and he was the beginning of the creation of God and God redeemed that body and when he came down he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased because he was coming to dwell in that vessel in the future home brother Branham would explain it this way that when he got out of the water John said I saw heavens open and the prophet saw and said the heavens open and here come descending out of heaven a form of a dove and a voice in this is my part of the earth that I have redeemed and from this part of the earth I will redeem the rest of it for he is my word made manifest hallelujah can you imagine what God did here the ground was crushed for Adams sake every man born all the death was cursed because of Alan come on somebody everything come under the curse of sin but well hallelujah there was one that was conceived of the Holy Ghost and there with that little blood sail on the inside begin to gather dust around him can I say it to you curse dirt earth that had been cursed and begin to wrap around of the sails the flood make the flesh of Jesus Christ and oh what a victory it must have been that day when Jesus the obedient son who didn't sell out like Adam but the obedient son brought us down to the river of Jordan to be baptized a man and the Spirit of God came and filled it and he said for this one I'm gonna redeem all the rest up up [Applause] there's going to be seed dinner born there's going to be a NOS brenigan a man he sucks ears offspring I say a 754 he was seeing Isaiah 53 now so again what was it it was there at the river giant Jesus brings his own body under submission to the Father's will and word and says we must fulfill all righteousness I'm here my purpose is here to fulfill the word and you got realized that's your new birth when you're born again that's your real purpose for being here is to fulfill God's word that is written of you so in Christ God would reconcile God and man Jesus would become the god man he would he would be man so he could feel the pain experience temptation yet without sin he would die yet he would be God in that the Almighty would be resident in him he would actually say it isn't me that doeth the works it's not the flesh profiteth nothing but he said it it's him the father's that dwelleth in me she do it the world you know this is a lot of trouble that people have today they can't figure out who Jesus was prayin to a man like like he you know that we got one you know Trinity wants to put everything three beans three persons equal in power and authority and yet Jesus is one God praying to another God one person praying to another when and when you pray to another you're showing inferior and asking for help when all three of you are supposed to be equal in power and equal come on hey man but but what but but what was it a man it was that God had became flesh and the flesh of Jesus was mad but within him 12d turtle god hallelujah a man I you know I as I looked in the scripture today you know the Bible tells you that Jesus is a man he would get hungry Jesus is a man he would age Jesus as a man somebody with me Jesus as a man but you would get tired and weary he'd get so exhausted from his healing campaigns and preaching till he'd fall asleep on the boat and a big storm rocking him around only just made him sleep like a baby until they finally woke him up and yet the Bible said he that watches over Israel neither slumbers or sleeps because he was as a man but yet he was God there at the River Jordan he brought his flesh that body of Claim willingly will bade the word of God to be baptized of John and this man this man this man who didn't do like a Adam did who sold it out this man brings his flesh right down to the river of Jordan to be baptized in obedience as a lamb surrendered himself to the father's will and the Holy Spirit is so pleased he comes and abides with him and remains now when Jesus was tempted with offers of power with obeying the devil was Satan offering him kingdoms the Bible doesn't say he fell to any of these offers or to this temptation and that the devil overtook him this is what it says when it's all done when he's tried on all points I want you to notice the leaves and angels are welcome what was God doing God was bringing a cure for sin oh I thought I would get a lot further than I am today and I'm not stopping yet but I'm probably going to have to stop on a point or two here in a few moments but let me just say God was bringing a cure for sin man found in our day in our hour you know man was subject to a lot of things you know Europeans for years and years and years lived under the scourge of smallpox they brought it over to America and American Indians had never experienced white man diseases so they had no antibodies built up in their blood from years of fighting it and millions of them died absolutely man long if we could just get something done there was a man there was a man that began to study and begin to think actually this man would become persecuted he would actually be driven out of cities because people were scared of what he was doing he would actually take virus a type of a virus then and he would inoculate children his servant his own self he'd inoculate you know and there would be as science would progress they would use horses and guinea pigs and monkeys and all kinds of animals to produce antibodies for disease but man was under a worse disease of smallpox amen smallpox is a is a killer small Paul it pops is a de former I mean the children it would get smallpox would be the left mark for the rest of their life sometimes hideously marred in their face and their eyes and everything else sometimes blinded from the disease but you see there was a worse disease and smallpox it was called sin disease a man and and so man tried everything that he could to find a cure for that disease and David you use all the remedies that that had been given you know the fallen trees there the ribbons the the things have for the frontlets before there are everything that you can imagine to you know to keep them young people would do that under smallpox they would wear certain magic stones or certain things and hope you know that this would keep the disease from them and their family only to get it man was an awful shape you know Israel wanted Messiah to save them from Rome but they needed a greater Messiah than just our greater salvation than just saving from the tyranny of Rome they needed a salvation from the journey of sin and man was in a dire straight but God had sent prophets down to the aegis worked his Holy Spirit did miracles and signs and great things but none of it produced a sin killer but one day God comes down himself and takes on the robe of humanity and he didn't or is somebody with me and then he didn't just let death come and and I you know hit a horse or here to get a pig but he went to the cross himself and Darian is rush he took the penalty of sin and he left said anchor it's finger at him oh that was an awful day for hell I member caasie that big tree over profits it had victory over the sages in that victory over grape man but this day sin lost its victory hallelujah and Paul could stream Arbogast where is fasting brave where is our victory thanks be to God that's been our Redeemer he gave us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ so God did not listen God did not allow somebody else for it to happen he came down and took on sin himself hallelujah amen and through his bud he produced an antibody a sin cure a man and when the Holy Ghost came down about Jesus at the day of his baptism Jesus was inoculated hallelujah and when the devil tried to give him all the world the kingdoms of the world what did you he stay right straight with the word why he was inoculated a man the Spirit of God didn't leave him in the hour temptation the seal held or we held him when Satan trimmed it it was women it held when Satan tempted him with Kingdom the inoculation held a man with said to Satan crippling him with compromise and with prestige nothing worked everything that devil told at him nothing work turned popular opinion against it it didn't work talk about the church against him in the fire season decide to see he did work he turned friends against them and his own people betray him and that didn't work but they're not ulation held whenever friend forsook him finally they knew he was a prophet and Romans the Romans soldiers put a rather on his head closes I'd took a stick beat him on the head with one hand and then say now if your prophet tell us who hit you will believe you but the knock ulation hell he wasn't clowning for the devil didn't mind the devil he said I only do what the father shows me to do amen approved the inoculation held the devil's oh well I got him now so he starts him at Calvary ho that's a mistake man he falls right into the trap God laid for him hey man if I can just get death to sting him this one hey like any of the other this is a virgin born son of God filled with the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] let's all stand together as we worship the Lord say well I got it now I thought him al I got it now oh he started a Calvary blood streaming out of his body a garment wrapped around him one big splash of blood the devil sing ha ha ha ha I've got him that can't be God no that can't be God he'd like any other man he's weak like any other man look at him he's screaming for water he's like any other man he died like any other man his Bloods like any other man he's powerless is any other man oh come out of that crosser will believe you see he has no power he's powerless hey man he let's so disappear him in the face big jerk handfuls appeared out of his face he let him challenge them to mature to see a vision and he wouldn't do it hey man oh he knew what he could do he knew what he can do he said I could call I could call for 10,000 angels I can compilations of angels and they take me off of this cross but I'm here to do the father's will amen because in my death is where I'm gonna redeem my bride this is what happened this is what happened when his wife had sinned he took her quickly to himself very men because he knew that in that that as he went with his wife the Redeemer would come and here's what Redemption was coming he would let them check handfuls challenge goes up the hill packing the cross I'll have him in a few minutes a man men goes over to slaps him in the face jerk handfuls of beard out hot down spit with drunken spitting spit it in his face they say forgive them father they don't know what they're doing he'd be riled on and round back what was it happen God was proving the inoculation he was making a way for you and I and giving you an example that as I overcome so will you overcome by the spirits and dwelling in you are you with me Amen there the inoculation held on Jesus it held at the cross Billy Billy suddenly said every tree was set in full of angels said of you you know you know you know you know you don't have to call that crunchiness for Jim finger and add will change that situation and he could have done it hey man but he said I do always that which pleases the father and the inoculation held no matter what happened the inoculation hell he was called belzebub the devil the fortune-teller whatever was every kind of blasphemy that can be said again sympathy inoculation hell a mound that watched him and they they won't see him he would scream and take it back at the cross surely surely he'll give up right at the cross surely surely surely he'll scream give give up but the inoculation held a man I'll tell you it held in the hour of death when he was in the grave three days and three nights the inoculation held on Easter morning an angel rolled away the stone and the Son of God arose again was sitting on high knew what he said if all of you want to get inoculated then get up there to the City of Jerusalem because I'm fixing to pour out the vaccine for them hallelujah I'm gonna send the serum right from headquarters right back there 120 I got my smallpox shot oh yeah I remember I was a little boy back five years old had to have my post smallpox shot before I went to school my man I cried I screamed I had a reaction it even left a mark on my shoulder that you can see to this day but I never ever ever got the terrible disease of smallpox why because I'm inoculated hallelujah down that they are pinnacles that were 120 men and women that were sealed with the Holy Ghost they screamed they started they reacted they rather they got locked and sealed by the Holy Spirit of God [Applause] desires of God Peters had made the men and women with boldness who proclaimed the Word of God and it settle the sin question forever hallelujah people say they got the holy yesterday and has no keeping power because he got a form of godlessness and deny the power there are there's a power in this inoculation man those who commit adultery and land and do all the works of the flesh that the Bible described is because they're not in the kingdom of God this of the Bible when you come in the kingdom when you come in this land maybe there's a new king that's a new ruler that's I met there was a new king on the throne and under his Dominion we reign as kings and priests hallelujah under this under this Dominion are you with me hey man oh yeah we reign as kings and priests are you raining this morning hey man let me just share with your quotas we're closing who is this Melchizedek but when this body receives the Spirit of God then order life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God hallelujah he that born of God did not commit sin he cannot sin Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus hallelujah a man that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit see that throws your body subjects and you don't have to say oh if I can just quit drinking just get in Christ it's all gone cuz your body is subject in the spirit is no more subject to the things the world they're dead a man they're dead your sins are buried in Baptism you havin your new new creation in Christ and your body becomes subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of life oh my like you women claiming you got the Holy Ghost going out here and wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the Spirit of God let you do such a thing it can't be so he's not a filthy spirit he's a Holy Spirit said brother him why didn't you say that because the Bible said if a man looks upon a woman to lust after in his heart he's committed adultery with her already in his heart are you with me amen and then you go out and parade yourself like that you're part of his adultery but when you become subject to that Holy Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest for Christian hallelujah made alive and when the body says don't do this the body quickly comes and obedient to what the Spirit says hallelujah I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them hallelujah hallelujah he became my sin that I might become him by his grace hallelujah let's bow our heads together while we have our head bowed just for a moment while we talk it over with him just a moment has that Holy Ghost fire come burned down in your life and burned out sin nature are you trying to have two kings on your throne at the same time [Music] what's the deal have you made that full surrender to God all brother Tim the unclean spirit went out and I've

and you find out your resolve only goes so far that your power runs out don't you want that inoculation from sin don't you want that cleansing power of the blood don't you want that Holy Spirit to come and abide with you forever oh so I'm a preacher not priests and I got anointed that's that's all wonderful I thank God for his anointing but as does he abide [Music] today the Christian world puts up men [Music] men preachers that have fallen in adultery you never kind of sin they just keep right on keep right on singing and preaching and whatever else and you know there was nothing there to hold him to our temptation they want to remain pastors and stay in positions knowing they're disqualified by the Word of God they coveted somebody else's wife and why was it they didn't get inoculated oh but I want to tell you it might be like that smallpox shot that branded me forever when this Holy Ghost comes on you little brands you it'll claim you it won't be you just claiming it it'll claim you it'll take up residence in your mortal body and it'll produce a vaccination from sin don't you want that today don't you want that I mean hands that go up say lord I need that kind of inoculation in my life I need that Holy Spirit I want it I want it in such a way Lord I wanted to when that inoculation comes and when temptation comes at knock ulation homes [Music] but the Brannon
