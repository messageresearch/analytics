[32:59] hey man let's turn to second Corinthians
[33:01] 10 verse 3 hey man
[33:15] says for though we walk in the flesh we
[33:19] do not war after the flesh for the
[33:22] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[33:24] but mighty through God to the pulling
[33:28] down of strongholds casting down
[33:31] imaginations and every high thing that
[33:34] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[33:36] God and bringing into captivity every
[33:39] thought to the obedience of Christ
[33:43] amen we let you be seated this evening
[33:49] like to read you this quote is I've been
[33:52] reading it nearly every day for the last
[33:54] few days and there's just really as
[33:57] blessed my heart is where I would like
[34:00] to bring the title from says hero the
[34:03] blessedness of believing the blessing of
[34:07] not trying to figure it out the blessing
[34:11] of just resting on God's Word and say
[34:14] it's true and go on hey man he said it's
[34:19] life it's life it's real living amen
[34:24] I'll read that again all the blessedness
[34:25] of believing that be my title tonight
[34:27] the blessedness of her believing the
[34:30] blessing of not trying to figure it out
[34:33] the blessing of just resting on God's
[34:36] word and say it's true and go on its
[34:40] life its life it's real living amen the
[34:45] blessing the blessedness of believing or
[34:49] being one who's able to believe because
[34:52] we live in a world you know that has to
[34:55] be everything has to be proven we live
[34:57] in a very scientific age and then this
[35:00] scientific age science wants to come and
[35:02] try to say well if it can't be proved by
[35:04] science and it's not true but you know I
[35:07] believe that we're not talking about
[35:09] even facts here we're talking about
[35:11] truth and what is truth he's the only
[35:14] one that is true amen and he is the god
[35:18] of truth he is truth and and you know
[35:21] you know that does not mean that Satan's
[35:23] not gonna war against us in our minds
[35:25] and to try to bring doubts and fear and
[35:27] unbelief or anything like that or if
[35:30] even though 100 people stand up and say
[35:32] it ain't true you know does that really
[35:33] mean that it's not true
[35:35] or if Satan is there to say it's not
[35:37] true does that mean it's not true amen
[35:39] but you know he's always there to war
[35:41] and you know our warfare is not in the
[35:45] fleshly realm is what David or those of
[35:48] the Old Testament and would be you know
[35:50] it's they would face a physical enemy
[35:52] you know sometimes I believe that would
[35:53] be easier you would know who the enemy
[35:56] is and and what it is and you know how
[35:58] he tries to come and you know exactly
[36:00] when he's coming on his ground because
[36:02] there's a physical presence there you
[36:04] know and I was not like that we have a
[36:06] spiritual warfare and he comes you know
[36:09] the greatest battle ever fought in her
[36:11] mind and he tries to find a place there
[36:13] that he can come and try to put a
[36:15] question and to put a question there
[36:18] that you have to answer you know and and
[36:20] and you know you know it's it's it's
[36:23] something that is a constant war you
[36:25] know the devil's like what about this
[36:26] and what about that you know and you
[36:28] know brother branham answers this she
[36:30] says you know there was a man one time
[36:31] that it officer there authored a book
[36:33] and made a lot of fun of him and he says
[36:36] you know it said in this book of all the
[36:38] devils it's william branham and he said
[36:40] he said that's what the devil tries to
[36:42] think he said visions and things that's
[36:44] of the devil he's some kind of hip not
[36:46] and hypnotists are working in some since
[36:50] super sensory perception he said see the
[36:53] intellectual world is always trying to
[36:56] figure it all out and he said that's
[36:58] where they tried to figure out Jesus how
[37:00] do you do these things what is done how
[37:02] do you how do you do this and he said I
[37:04] ask you a question was the Ministry of
[37:06] John was it of God or was it of man and
[37:08] they said we can't say and he said
[37:10] neither do I tell you that that's right
[37:12] he just went went on and from henceforth
[37:15] no man asked him anything he just cut
[37:18] him off right there he didn't tell them
[37:20] nothing about it it was none of their
[37:23] business he said he had a work to do and
[37:26] he finished it and he said god help us
[37:29] to do the same thing even God help us to
[37:33] do the same thing we don't have to
[37:35] answer the devil's questions
[37:39] because it's the devil's questions is
[37:41] not my question it's his question he
[37:43] ma'am he said that's right you know you
[37:45] go right on and just ignore the whole
[37:48] thing C Eve got caught up in this and
[37:50] she tried to answer the devil's question
[37:53] you know Eve was you know or Knutson not
[37:55] being satisfied in the beginning with a
[37:57] wonderful fellowship that she had with
[37:59] Adam and gardening and you know she had
[38:02] to begin to try to hunt something new
[38:04] some new light and the devil scene she
[38:07] got it and when she when you try to find
[38:09] something you know a little more
[38:10] fantastic or a little something
[38:13] different than the written word the
[38:15] devil will be right there - presented to
[38:18] you he said that's right he said if Eve
[38:20] would has just stayed with the word and
[38:22] there's this great sin problem would
[38:25] have never happened because God had
[38:27] promised him that they could live
[38:28] forever but she wanted something
[38:30] different and she had these questions in
[38:33] the woods and really hurt questions they
[38:36] was the devil's questions and she begins
[38:38] to try to answer them and begins they're
[38:41] trying to debate them it begins to try
[38:43] to come up with some kind of way of
[38:45] answer me said to see a man you know
[38:47] will try to have an intellectual faith
[38:49] you know this is a quote brother Brennan
[38:51] says the intellectual faith and you'll
[38:53] try to answer the devil's questions with
[38:55] an intellectual faith and and he said
[38:58] there's so many people get that today
[39:00] calling themselves Christians he says
[39:02] that's the reason you see as much
[39:04] carrying on as you do under the name of
[39:07] Christianity why it's only intellectual
[39:10] faith he says what do you mean by that
[39:12] he says men believe under salvation he
[39:16] said now faith cometh by hearing and the
[39:18] hearing of the word he said I could
[39:20] preach the word and you can accept it
[39:22] and say it's right but he said if that's
[39:25] as far as it goes it's just intellectual
[39:27] faith he said but see I said the reason
[39:30] people don't get healed or reason why
[39:33] people walk away or the reason why
[39:35] people fall off it's only because of an
[39:38] intellectual view what their mind
[39:40] conceives he said but the mind will
[39:42] reason the mind will say I can't get any
[39:45] better
[39:46] it's not getting any better I don't feel
[39:48] any better than I did yesterday
[39:49] reasoning mental theology will reason it
[39:53] out and say well now wait a minute I
[39:54] don't believe in that bunch of
[39:56] foolishness see your reasoning
[39:58] intellectual faith will do that but once
[40:01] that faith comes down into this
[40:03] compartment down here it'll never
[40:05] question what's up here at all it's
[40:08] absolutely fact it'll agree with every
[40:11] divine word of God
[40:13] he said that's the reason people don't
[40:15] get to where they should be it's because
[40:18] there's a mental conception of God and
[40:20] when it's just a mental Collatz its
[40:22] conception of God you believe it by the
[40:25] intellectual faith that won't ever do it
[40:28] it's got to be a born-again experience
[40:32] and this is where people gets off
[40:34] because they've depended upon their
[40:36] mental intellectual conception you know
[40:39] I believe the message and I believe what
[40:41] the Prophet said or I believe he's a
[40:43] prophet or I believe the way you know I
[40:45] believe what the pastor says and it's
[40:47] all faith comes by hearing but if you
[40:50] stop there it's only a mental conception
[40:53] it's only an intellectual faith but only
[40:56] the really the only real way to know God
[40:59] is to be born of God to be born of the
[41:02] supernatural and when you see men that
[41:05] are denying the message or the denying
[41:07] amen the very very the things that God
[41:10] has said in his word is why because they
[41:12] have tried to figure it all out with
[41:14] their mental conception but they've
[41:16] never been born of the supernatural be
[41:19] therefore they cannot understand the
[41:21] supernatural and sometimes super emit
[41:24] all the time I should say certain
[41:25] natural things cannot be figured out by
[41:28] a natural mind it's supernatural that's
[41:31] why it's called supernatural it's
[41:33] something beyond the natural and so men
[41:36] with the natural understanding or
[41:37] natural abilities or a wonderful or
[41:40] powerful brain they try to line up the
[41:42] things of God and you cannot even go and
[41:45] prove all the things in the Bible you
[41:47] can't prove many things that are written
[41:49] there we can't prove that Jesus even
[41:51] existed by mental conception the only
[41:54] way that I know that he exists is
[41:56] because there's a power
[41:57] here on this earth that I overcome the
[41:59] devil just like he did there
[42:02] Amen that there so there's a power of
[42:04] the Resurrection there's a power that's
[42:06] here today that a raised the dead
[42:09] there's a power here that a hill the
[42:11] sick there's a power here that'll save
[42:13] the lost there's a power here
[42:15] Amen that'll take an old rip it rip it
[42:18] sinful heart and turn it around and live
[42:21] above sin and live above things why
[42:24] because the power that was there is the
[42:27] power that is here today Amen it's guy
[42:31] that can only come by born-again
[42:33] experience when your faith has brought
[42:36] down from here into here a man he said
[42:40] god help us this morning or this evening
[42:42] now to enter into that inner life amen
[42:48] quit stayin out where we're toast about
[42:50] with every wind of doctrine and
[42:52] everything that comes along and don't
[42:54] you know the Bible says in the last days
[42:56] how that men will come and be like
[42:58] angels of light he meant Devils
[43:01] ministers as angels of life don't you
[43:03] realize that Eve was seeking new light
[43:05] when the devil talked to her and caused
[43:08] every graveyard that's here because
[43:10] every insane institution caused every
[43:13] death every sorrow every starving every
[43:16] dying mama why because she was searching
[43:19] for something else
[43:22] and she had a know and searching for
[43:25] something else and you notice he says
[43:28] when he was here he said lo I'm with you
[43:30] always and their eyes were open and they
[43:33] understood and Peter you know was their
[43:36] bosom friends with him talked with him
[43:38] but you know what now all of a sudden
[43:41] there's so many questions and and he's
[43:43] wondering Peter's wondering what it was
[43:45] he related to Christ you know it wasn't
[43:47] really this or wasn't really that did we
[43:50] really see all the things you know when
[43:51] Peter becomes so discouraged because of
[43:54] this mental conception he became so
[43:58] despair
[43:59] said after his death and it barity and
[44:02] he said I'm just so discouraged huh I'm
[44:04] just going to go fishing I'm just going
[44:07] to go away from here you know we get
[44:09] that way sometimes and if we depend on
[44:12] this right here and what we see with
[44:14] these right here it's very easy to get
[44:16] discouraged because we see people
[44:19] falling away we we see things happening
[44:22] and we see things around us that we
[44:24] can't control we don't know what to do
[44:26] with and if we look at these eyes and
[44:28] try to figure out what this pea brain we
[44:30] got we will be discouraged will stay
[44:32] discouraged and this is what Peter was
[44:35] he was looking at this with his mental
[44:37] conception of who he thought Jesus was
[44:40] and who he who he proclaimed that he was
[44:42] and all that but now it seems to be all
[44:44] gone and it seems to be done and dead
[44:46] I'm just going to go fishing now and he
[44:51] got discouraged and he said here he was
[44:54] with a mental theology but you know they
[44:56] believe once in the natural but when a
[44:59] little trial come up and went all to
[45:00] pieces he said I don't aim to hurt you
[45:02] but he said I want to tell you something
[45:04] correct you a little bit it shows when a
[45:07] man wholly has intellectual faith by
[45:10] saying that the Word of God that that's
[45:12] the Word of God I believe God rose up
[45:15] Jesus today he said that's all you got
[45:17] the first little discouragement comes in
[45:20] your church and away you'll go when
[45:24] you're going out you might be a friend
[45:26] to him but you don't know him in his
[45:28] power of his resurrection and this is
[45:31] where Peter was he was a friend of Jesus
[45:34] he had a mental conception of what he
[45:36] thought he was he saw only sangs and his
[45:39] mighty miracles and you to thought and
[45:40] for all the things that he saw nothing
[45:43] could talk him out of it but he'd had to
[45:46] go from a mental conception he meant
[45:49] down to really believe in a man and we
[45:51] can see what happened you know us as
[45:53] they went you know as he was go to the
[45:56] pit you know you go to Pentecost and
[45:57] this is what brother Branham says and he
[45:59] says never one time after Pentecost did
[46:02] that
[46:03] picture that preacher Peter ever saved
[46:05] such a thing as that again amen when he
[46:09] had come to those discouragement amen he
[46:12] would go back to experience that he had
[46:15] this is what we never can quit preaching
[46:18] the experience of the Holy Ghost because
[46:22] if we don't have that we have nothing
[46:24] but a mental conception we have nothing
[46:28] but a Baptist theology and this is where
[46:34] many are today that have walked away
[46:35] from this truth they don't walked away
[46:37] in Jesus day when he had said something
[46:41] to him about men but you drink my blood
[46:44] and y'all better walked away I mean even
[46:50] true believers have these moments but
[46:53] once Peter received the Holy Ghost it
[46:56] was an anchor sure he come back to those
[47:00] discouragements again don't tell me that
[47:03] when he saw the nonsense going on in the
[47:05] churches and even Paul that will face
[47:07] discouragements there's all kind of
[47:10] nonsense taking place in churches and
[47:12] things that was going on in the first
[47:14] churches it was all kind of stuff that
[47:15] and it's never stopped he's never going
[47:19] to stop we're gonna have me and
[47:22] following away we're gonna have things
[47:24] that are happening it's going to
[47:25] continue why Satan's gunz's are upon us
[47:29] and he's going to get those it never
[47:32] goes into the Holy of Holies he's going
[47:35] to get those that never amen go so
[47:37] that's why we must make our calling and
[47:39] election sure that it's more than just I
[47:43] believe or I accept the truth or I
[47:45] accept a way of living if something's
[47:47] happened on the inside of my heart it
[47:50] goes beyond my feelings it goes beyond
[47:53] all things to where you can come to that
[47:55] moment of discouragement and you can
[47:57] look that devil
[47:58] I'd say don't God slave me yet I'll
[48:01] trust him though a thousand fall at my
[48:04] left side and ten thousand at my rights
[48:06] I'm going on with Jesus hallelujah
[48:11] there's gotta be something deep on the
[48:13] inside of you it's an anchor cuz all
[48:18] hell is against this church all hell is
[48:22] blowing it and trying to push the
[48:24] coldness of Laodicea in here and trying
[48:27] to put the mug warmness opponents it's
[48:29] coming into our hearts burning dark
[48:32] churches coming to our pews it's coming
[48:35] to our homes it's constantly pushing
[48:38] against you in wave after wave after
[48:40] wave
[48:41] but in this ship of zon there's an
[48:44] anchor and it's an anchor that's holding
[48:47] the heart of a believer that no matter
[48:49] how many ways cracks against it no
[48:51] matter how many say it ain't so no
[48:54] matter how many distract from it and
[48:55] they turn away there's an anchor holding
[48:58] somebody and when I'm gonna can testify
[49:01] tonight the anchor holds
[49:06] sharing on a face discouragement
[49:09] chilling on the face but since Pentecost
[49:11] oh yeah
[49:21] hey man he says now he's if he got good
[49:25] reason you'll sit down and try to reason
[49:28] the Bible out how could he raise from
[49:30] the dead how these miracles and things
[49:33] take place in this great room with
[49:34] civilization science that we live in you
[49:36] try to reason that out so what's
[49:39] happening every time you're getting
[49:41] further away from God all the time you
[49:45] never know him by reasoning God is not
[49:50] known by reasoning God is known by faith
[49:53] you accept it you believe it you can't
[49:56] do it until something happens to you
[49:58] when the Holy Spirit comes in and you're
[50:01] not having your mind you'll have the
[50:03] mind of Christ when Brandon calls him
[50:09] Agri find great minister was down here
[50:12] in the south took a plane flew up to
[50:14] meet me some time ago he said brother
[50:16] branham i was reading one of your
[50:17] sermons and a paper there's just one
[50:19] thing I want to settle with you said all
[50:20] right he said how can you do anything
[50:22] else but believe he says Abraham was the
[50:26] father of the promised son he believed
[50:29] God that was imputed him to
[50:31] righteousness what more could Abraham do
[50:32] but believe I said that's correct sir
[50:35] that's all he could do but then God came
[50:38] down and gave him the seal of
[50:39] circumcision the confirmation of his
[50:43] faith come on somebody
[50:46] he said infusions for 30 grieve not the
[50:49] Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed unto
[50:51] the day of your Redemption if you raise
[50:54] up and confess Christ and say you
[50:56] believe in when the intellectual faith
[50:57] and gods never give you the Holy Ghost
[51:00] yet he hasn't confirmed your faith yet
[51:04] he said that's the confirmation is the
[51:07] Holy Spirit God confirmed
[51:10] your faith with the Holy Ghost then you
[51:14] believe it with your head and then until
[51:16] then you believe it with your head but
[51:18] God puts it into your heart by birth he
[51:21] said that kind of sounds a little
[51:23] fashioned brother but it's kept me all
[51:26] these years I've stared death in the
[51:29] faith and I'm ready to trust on it he
[51:31] said if it's good enough for me it's
[51:33] good enough for Paul it was good enough
[51:36] for Silas it was good enough all the way
[51:38] down it's good enough for me in Hell
[51:43] then it'll hold now but your
[51:51] intellectual faith will reason you say
[51:54] well now I know the Bible teaches that
[51:56] but let me think now the days of
[51:58] miracles are past pastor said so
[52:00] somebody said this I believe that this
[52:02] day we don't have that now you see
[52:04] you're using intellectual faith and that
[52:07] intellectual faith will reason with
[52:09] God's Word but a born-again experience
[52:11] for my heart will not reason it'll say
[52:15] God's Word is right period hey man
[52:20] there's no more to do with it it's right
[52:23] because something down here that says in
[52:26] itself you you have nothing to do with
[52:28] it it's God in the heart the
[52:30] intellectual faith will reason and
[52:32] that's what's the matter with our
[52:33] churches we've got away from a real old
[52:37] time experience of receiving the Holy
[52:40] Spirit this is why people can't get
[52:44] Church attenders down right they reason
[52:46] it all out but it shows they haven't got
[52:49] a Holy Ghost experience they got an
[52:53] intellectual faith they believe in Jesus
[52:55] they believe going to church is ok but
[52:58] they don't have it down in the heart
[53:01] they reason it away otherwise they would
[53:03] be in the house of God it's an
[53:09] intellectual faith and that intellectual
[53:12] faith is going to only hold people so
[53:14] long because somebody will come up with
[53:18] more intellectual than what you got and
[53:20] more faith in what you got hello
[53:23] somebody
[53:24] it takes a lot of faith to believe in no
[53:26] God and you find somebody that's got
[53:30] more faith in what you've got and all
[53:32] you're doing is intellectual against
[53:33] intellectual they'll win but you can
[53:37] take somebody as dumb as a box of rocks
[53:39] but he'd met God and it ain't up here
[53:42] but it's down on the inside of his heart
[53:44] they the intellectual giant nowhere they
[53:46] never talk him out of a God because he's
[53:49] met him for himself kind of like we can
[53:53] watch Moses he was an intellectual up
[53:56] here they killed one Egyptian by his own
[53:58] intellect but once he met the burning
[54:01] bush
[54:02] you couldn't talk him out of it no more
[54:04] he would go down there in defeat Egypt
[54:07] with his great army all that was just a
[54:10] meal a wife a boy and a rod why because
[54:15] he wasn't counting on his own intellect
[54:16] no more he didn't have to figure out how
[54:19] to defeat Pharaoh he didn't have to
[54:21] figure out how it's all going to happen
[54:22] God said you go tell him let my people
[54:25] go he wouldn't know what God said and
[54:29] God did what he said he would do
[54:33] hallelujah if we get people to believe
[54:36] like that the blessedness of a believer
[54:39] why because he was there
[54:42] nobody could talk Moses out of that
[54:45] experience he was there and left why I
[54:51] love that song said I was there when the
[54:54] Spirit came down he made no money and
[54:57] talked you out of it because there's his
[54:59] personal experience - you ain't a devil
[55:02] that can talk you out of it come on
[55:04] somebody but as long as it's just
[55:06] intellectual faith it'll reason that's
[55:08] what's the matter today and got away
[55:10] from the experience of receiving the
[55:13] Holy Ghost we've substituted for
[55:16] intellectualism aural intellectual
[55:18] college he said I'm not trying to
[55:19] support ignorance what I'm trying to say
[55:21] is if it comes between education and
[55:24] salvation
[55:25] I'll take salvation remember the trouble
[55:29] of his day we've learned all together on
[55:31] education and having adopted it instead
[55:34] of salvation we substituted then the
[55:37] old-fashioned Upper Room to receive the
[55:39] Holy Spirit for a supper room to sell
[55:42] and sell soups and things to pay the
[55:44] preacher and we don't need that we need
[55:46] the Bible the whole fashioned Holy Ghost
[55:48] spirit that old-time st. Paul revival
[55:51] the Bible Holy Ghost in the church again
[55:54] and it's here tonight hallelujah and it
[55:59] will only come through the experience of
[56:02] a new birth but the enemy is going to
[56:10] study our strategy with the word and if
[56:15] it's the intellectual faith he'll try to
[56:17] use the word against that you know just
[56:21] dealing with a situation last weekend
[56:23] the devil had a little girl bound up
[56:27] told me he spoke out of that little girl
[56:30] and told me said it happened when she
[56:32] was a little girl it's her fault she let
[56:37] him do it look back at that devil and I
[56:40] said no it ain't her fault it's your
[56:41] fault you did it
[56:44] and furthermore I'm not gonna hold a
[56:47] conversation with you because I'm not
[56:48] interested in talking to you and shut
[56:50] your mouth
[56:52] that's the first step with stopping the
[56:54] devil's reason and shut your mouth come
[56:59] on somebody don't it ain't hello you can
[57:01] make the arguments last and how long it
[57:04] shut your mouth and whatever it takes
[57:07] shut the mouth
[57:10] you never spoke out again but she took
[57:13] her Bible we got it into the back room
[57:14] and it took her Bible she was looking at
[57:16] me very nervously fumbling through the
[57:18] scriptures and she pointed to a certain
[57:20] scripture there in the Old Testament in
[57:22] the Levitical law of where damsels
[57:24] taking them afield and man lay with her
[57:27] and she should be stoned you know it
[57:29] devil handed me that handed her that had
[57:34] it a lot highlighted in her Bible listen
[57:36] the devil ain't using something way out
[57:37] yonder to try to defeat somebody he's
[57:40] coming right here with the word just as
[57:42] he did Eve and he'll defeat you as long
[57:45] as his intellectual faith but if his
[57:48] Holy Ghost faith he ain't got no answer
[57:52] hallelujah Amen and I looked at that and
[57:55] I didn't really know the situation so I
[57:56] handed it to the brother of the pastor
[57:58] there a man and he looked at that and he
[58:00] took that scripture and he beat the
[58:02] devil's teeth in he said what I see here
[58:05] is the same thing that happened in the
[58:07] garden with Eve
[58:08] he took a scripture and twisted it and
[58:10] this scripture does not apply to you
[58:13] this is nothing but the devil trying to
[58:16] twist something and try to make it
[58:18] George but it's not yours
[58:19] it's his hallelujah and I'm here to tell
[58:24] you this evening the sin and the doubt
[58:27] not believe that's not yours
[58:29] that's his unbelief he's just trying to
[58:32] put it on you but you didn't catch that
[58:34] thing down it's how I'm going to believe
[58:37] all things are possible
[58:43] hallelujah you never want to reason gods
[58:47] with God's Word you just believe it
[58:50] don't try to explain it no try to figure
[58:53] it all out you cannot figure out God
[58:55] it's God isn't it is the word and it's
[58:58] um just made to believe it's just made
[59:02] to believe that's our strength just
[59:04] accept the word anyone knows that a seed
[59:06] in the right ground will produce of its
[59:09] kind and we should just take the word
[59:11] and believe but Eve stop for a moment
[59:15] and reasoned he quoted words she quoted
[59:18] word God said you should not eat their
[59:21] own he said certainly that's right Satan
[59:23] said Nate and disagrees that certainly
[59:25] is our right but see you need a little
[59:27] something added know something different
[59:29] and if you do it then you'll be a little
[59:31] smarter than God and your eyes will be
[59:32] open she said well God said we would die
[59:35] Oh surely you won't die but God said you
[59:38] would and that settles it and that broke
[59:41] that great tug O'War that pulled the
[59:44] whole human race into death because Eve
[59:47] listening to it listen to a reason
[59:48] against God's Word it's a shame that he
[59:51] did she did it and it's done past but
[59:53] now we're here fortified and that link
[59:56] was made up in Christ Jesus we know that
[59:59] God gave us his best defense to just
[1:00:01] simply trust his word hallelujah Romans
[1:00:14] 1 8 1 moment warning verse 16 says for I
[1:00:17] am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ I
[1:00:22] want to make this my declaration I'm not
[1:00:26] ashamed of this message because this
[1:00:28] message is the Bible this message is
[1:00:33] Christ now I'm not ashamed of the gospel
[1:00:37] of Christ for in it for it is the power
[1:00:41] of God unto salvation to everyone that
[1:00:44] believeth it's not to the unbeliever and
[1:00:50] you will never ever get to the
[1:00:53] bottom of the unbelievers questions
[1:00:55] you'll never get to the end maybe that's
[1:00:58] a better word you'll never get to the
[1:01:00] end of an unbelievers questions Amen
[1:01:05] it's what everyone that believeth to the
[1:01:07] Jew first and also to the Greek and
[1:01:09] therein is righteousness of God revealed
[1:01:11] from what faith to faith it is written
[1:01:16] the just shall live by faith for the
[1:01:22] wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[1:01:23] against all ungodliness and
[1:01:26] righteousness men who hold the truth in
[1:01:28] unrighteousness because that which may
[1:01:30] be known of God is manifest in them for
[1:01:33] God has showed it unto them for the
[1:01:36] invisible things of him from the
[1:01:38] creation of the world we're clearly seen
[1:01:39] being understood by the things that were
[1:01:41] made even his eternal power and Godhead
[1:01:44] so that they are without excuse because
[1:01:50] that when they knew God they glorified
[1:01:52] not him him not as God neither we're
[1:01:55] thankful but became vain in their
[1:01:57] imaginations they thought what they
[1:02:01] thought was greater than what God said
[1:02:04] what they thought they thought was
[1:02:07] greater than what God vindicated come on
[1:02:11] somebody
[1:02:12] God had vindicated himself from the body
[1:02:14] called Jesus Christ
[1:02:16] nobody even a blind man could see it
[1:02:20] come on somebody a blind man had been
[1:02:23] born blind from his side from his birth
[1:02:25] even when he when he was giving him
[1:02:27] sight he knew there could be nobody done
[1:02:29] what was done to him but God he said why
[1:02:34] here's a marvelous saying because see
[1:02:36] what happened he was born without even
[1:02:37] eyeballs and here came the Creator the
[1:02:39] very one that spoke the heavens on earth
[1:02:41] into existence and came made a few
[1:02:44] little mud balls and spit it or make mud
[1:02:46] put him into his eye sockets and said go
[1:02:48] wash and he went wash and he came back
[1:02:50] saying one of my favorite stories
[1:02:53] because the disciples say was this done
[1:02:55] because his man sinned or his mom and
[1:02:57] dad is saying that God said no Jesus
[1:02:59] said no he said this so that God can be
[1:03:01] made glorified could be glorified
[1:03:04] hey man well that's just a bunch of
[1:03:07] reason and trying to put all these
[1:03:09] things on what somebody else did or
[1:03:11] somebody else listen I'm not responsible
[1:03:14] for anybody else's sins and neither are
[1:03:17] you
[1:03:18] that's between them and God
[1:03:21] what I'm responsible to is if I believe
[1:03:23] what he said and here this little man
[1:03:27] begin to see and question him
[1:03:30] could you imagine questioning when you
[1:03:33] just seen that they couldn't they
[1:03:35] couldn't deny that this was the boy they
[1:03:39] knew it was because then they called his
[1:03:40] mom and dad they couldn't deny that that
[1:03:43] was her son but he didn't stop the
[1:03:46] questions they couldn't deny that he had
[1:03:49] our boss and he was seeing but it didn't
[1:03:53] stop the questions come on somebody
[1:03:56] they couldn't deny that something that
[1:03:59] supernaturally happened and some would
[1:04:01] take place because they'd seen this man
[1:04:03] day after day after day of begging for
[1:04:05] alms as a blind man and now he's
[1:04:07] standing before them amen talking to
[1:04:09] them as a normal man seeing them looking
[1:04:12] around seeing all the beauty of God's
[1:04:14] creation they could not deny but it
[1:04:16] didn't stop the questions
[1:04:20] because it wasn't questions from an
[1:04:22] honest heart
[1:04:23] it was questions because of their
[1:04:25] unbelief you know the Bible's plainly
[1:04:32] tells about questions it talks about
[1:04:34] Judas asking about the ointment that was
[1:04:36] given why couldn't it be sold and given
[1:04:38] to the poor the Bible says it wasn't
[1:04:41] because he didn't ask because he cared
[1:04:43] for the poor he asked because he was a
[1:04:45] thief mercy these these men wasn't
[1:04:53] asking because it was honesty there they
[1:04:55] was asking because they were unbelievers
[1:05:00] hey man but it didn't stop him and here
[1:05:05] the bottom man finally stops and he says
[1:05:06] I don't know how to answer all your
[1:05:09] questions
[1:05:10] I I don't I don't know what to say about
[1:05:14] all of this nonsense to say all I know
[1:05:17] that never since the world was formed
[1:05:20] has a man been born blind been given
[1:05:22] this sight and you don't know who he is
[1:05:26] that's the real question answer that one
[1:05:32] amen and you know you come to the
[1:05:34] distractors of this message that comes
[1:05:36] with a question after question after
[1:05:37] class 'king question because they want
[1:05:40] to believe they're asking question
[1:05:42] because something's wrong with their
[1:05:43] heart if they could get the hard
[1:05:46] question settled then all these other
[1:05:47] questions would just disappeared but I
[1:05:51] want to ask them a question never since
[1:05:53] the world
[1:05:54] amen since the time of Jesus has a
[1:05:56] ministry been on her like was in the
[1:05:58] Prophet William Brennan miracles and
[1:06:01] signs and wonders and that the hearts
[1:06:03] discerned time after time after time and
[1:06:05] you don't know who that is
[1:06:12] because they begin to lean to their own
[1:06:14] understanding the Bible told us not to
[1:06:18] probably proverbs 3 and verse 1 my son
[1:06:21] forget not my law but let thine heart
[1:06:24] keep my Commandments for the length of
[1:06:26] days long life and peace shall they add
[1:06:28] unto thee let not mercy and truth
[1:06:30] forsake thee bind them about the neck
[1:06:33] write them up on the tables of that
[1:06:35] heart so shalt thou find favour and good
[1:06:38] understanding in the sight of God and
[1:06:40] man trust in the Lord with all thine
[1:06:43] heart yes some can trust so far and
[1:06:49] believe he's God but can they trust all
[1:06:51] with all their heart you know what that
[1:06:56] means trust the Lord with all thy heart
[1:06:58] that means give all thy heart to the
[1:07:01] Lord it's the Holy Ghost and lean not
[1:07:05] unto that own understanding in all thy
[1:07:09] ways acknowledge him and he shall direct
[1:07:11] their paths see Solomon told us don't
[1:07:13] lean to your own understanding but we
[1:07:16] wonder why he would say such a thing
[1:07:18] like this because that usually you know
[1:07:20] in our modern understandings you
[1:07:22] the wisdom of man is in the wisdom of
[1:07:25] man is always contrary to the Word of
[1:07:27] God you know I think that's what Solomon
[1:07:31] was trying to advise his sons was not to
[1:07:33] be illiterate not to be stupid and
[1:07:36] unlearned as far as and you know we have
[1:07:39] we have to have some you know people get
[1:07:42] the wrong idea that the message is
[1:07:43] against education no the message is not
[1:07:46] against education or becoming educated
[1:07:49] to where you can get a good job or be a
[1:07:51] CPA or be whatever nurse practitioner or
[1:07:55] doctor whatever you want to be that's
[1:07:56] not what the message is being but don't
[1:07:58] elevate your education above the Word of
[1:08:01] God education of this world is only for
[1:08:05] the things of this world come on
[1:08:10] somebody education of this world is only
[1:08:12] to obtain a job is that of this of the
[1:08:15] is that of the Eternals no jobs going to
[1:08:17] be going it's only to obtain things to
[1:08:19] take care of you here on why you're on
[1:08:21] earth whether it be money or cars or
[1:08:23] paper
[1:08:24] clothes whatever food on your table it's
[1:08:26] only for the temporary but people begin
[1:08:29] to take that what they've learned and
[1:08:30] their knowledge and and begin to exalt
[1:08:32] that above the Word of God no the Word
[1:08:36] of God always a SERPs authority over
[1:08:38] what you've learned in some school
[1:08:40] somewhere whether it be a school of
[1:08:42] education or theology the Word of God is
[1:08:45] the final answer because remember no
[1:08:57] matter how much education you get one
[1:09:00] day you got to cross over
[1:09:05] no matter how much education you've got
[1:09:08] no matter how much culture you're able
[1:09:10] to accumulate you've got to face death
[1:09:13] one day you know and I've talked with
[1:09:17] people that don't believe you know in
[1:09:20] God and this is where the spiral of
[1:09:23] unbelief takes you listen it ain't just
[1:09:25] about walking away from a thought or a
[1:09:28] theology or a-- or a beliefs system
[1:09:33] Satan's not interested in that he don't
[1:09:36] want to just get you to where you will
[1:09:38] still believe in God he's gonna take
[1:09:40] people all the way down to where that
[1:09:41] takes it all away from them and I've
[1:09:45] forgotten tough talk to message young
[1:09:46] people that have got their because of
[1:09:48] somebody's unbelief they started trying
[1:09:50] to answer the devil's questions and
[1:09:53] today they don't even believe in God
[1:09:55] and I asked the young man I said okay
[1:10:01] you've got here I don't I can't I don't
[1:10:03] I can't see I can't I don't have enough
[1:10:06] I guess intellect to understand how you
[1:10:09] got there because to me it takes more
[1:10:11] faith to believe that and to believe
[1:10:13] what I believe that there's no God and
[1:10:16] all this just come out of nothing it
[1:10:20] takes a lot of faith and and I said but
[1:10:26] you know we close our eyes and we both
[1:10:31] close our eyes same same time whatever
[1:10:34] and there's nothing what have I lost
[1:10:43] think about it there's life that we live
[1:10:46] the the what the truths that we believe
[1:10:49] the things that we believe the way we
[1:10:52] dress the way we act the way we present
[1:10:54] ourselves and we get down to the end of
[1:10:56] it and we close our eyes and there's
[1:10:58] nothing what have we really lost I said
[1:11:03] but I want to ask you we close our eyes
[1:11:07] and we get down then and we close our
[1:11:09] eyes and you realize there is a God and
[1:11:11] there is something to this afterlife
[1:11:14] then what what have you lost because one
[1:11:21] day we're all going to come to this
[1:11:23] place and no matter how much you've
[1:11:27] accumulated how much education you got
[1:11:30] how much money you got in the bank how
[1:11:32] all this intellectual knowledge one day
[1:11:35] it's going to be nothing because it's
[1:11:40] written men what that must die and after
[1:11:42] that the judgment
[1:11:43] death ain't gonna be the bad thing
[1:11:46] judgements what's gonna be bad
[1:11:49] God is not going to inquire and they're
[1:11:51] at the judgment how much schooling you
[1:11:53] got how much you accumulated on earth
[1:11:56] how much money was in your 401 K what
[1:11:59] kind of art you are plaques you got
[1:12:01] hanging on your wall whether your
[1:12:02] bachelor of art or that whatever a
[1:12:04] minister is not that's not going to be
[1:12:07] required what's going to be required is
[1:12:10] what you did with the understanding of
[1:12:12] God's Word where the requirement comes
[1:12:16] your education is fine but the word of
[1:12:19] god is life my words are life I know
[1:12:24] it's life he said know him he is the
[1:12:26] word so you can only know him by the
[1:12:28] word for he is the word that's the only
[1:12:30] way you'll know him so when a person
[1:12:31] says they have the Holy Ghost and can
[1:12:34] accept something contrary to the word it
[1:12:36] shows that ain't the real genuine Holy
[1:12:39] Ghost they've got and I'm not talking
[1:12:44] about it you know I believe that what
[1:12:45] he's saying here is not just talking
[1:12:47] about something other than the word and
[1:12:49] that's part of it but another spirit
[1:12:52] allow sin to overtake them they don't
[1:12:55] have a Holy Ghost
[1:12:57] unable to speak out of them they don't
[1:12:59] have the Holy Ghost that ain't the real
[1:13:04] Holy Ghost say God it might be a ghost
[1:13:06] he says he said I wouldn't dispute that
[1:13:08] but it isn't the Holy Ghost of Christ
[1:13:10] they take on one another spirits of the
[1:13:13] point like a group of men a certain
[1:13:14] thing he won't point to Christ with the
[1:13:16] Holy Spirit always points to Christ
[1:13:20] that's what I love about this message it
[1:13:23] always pointed to Christ if there was
[1:13:25] ever a man on this earth that could make
[1:13:28] something of himself would've been
[1:13:29] William Branham but he never pulled him
[1:13:33] into himself he putted him to Christ if
[1:13:38] you want to say something about somebody
[1:13:39] go talk about those who pointed there
[1:13:42] was people to themselves and built
[1:13:43] themselves castles and built themselves
[1:13:45] all kinds of things there's plenty to
[1:13:49] criticize if you lean to your own
[1:13:58] understanding you're gonna get off the
[1:14:00] roads right Road somewhere you can't
[1:14:02] lean on anybody else's understanding but
[1:14:05] when it comes to life find life find
[1:14:09] that real source of life that's what you
[1:14:12] hear it preached time after time after
[1:14:14] time received the Holy Ghost it'll be
[1:14:18] the desperation on everybody's heart
[1:14:21] make your calling and election sure I
[1:14:24] don't care if you've been sitting on a
[1:14:26] Pew here for 30 years make sure make
[1:14:31] sure you got the token the seal could
[1:14:36] you imagine you know I think about the
[1:14:39] different ones like you know as we spoke
[1:14:43] of even let me go with this for a minute
[1:14:44] Eve you know no doubt an intelligent
[1:14:47] person right from Adam who was the son
[1:14:50] of God in a spot no sin no place for sin
[1:14:55] must have certainly had a wonderful
[1:14:58] conception of who God was because I ever
[1:15:02] afternoon her and her husband will walk
[1:15:04] in the cool of the garden in the evening
[1:15:06] and talk face-to-face with God what a
[1:15:08] none reason
[1:15:09] thing that a person would walk
[1:15:12] face-to-face with God each day then
[1:15:14] turned to reason and reason her way away
[1:15:17] from God and it don't stop there he says
[1:15:22] we still got them today they're so
[1:15:26] easily be reason away from the Word of
[1:15:28] God after sinning in the presence of God
[1:15:32] seeing the Word of God preached the Word
[1:15:35] of God manifested to where drunkards and
[1:15:37] sinners come to an altar be converted
[1:15:39] made through creations and creatures in
[1:15:42] Christ people of ill Fame made ladies
[1:15:44] and gentlemen than then turn her right
[1:15:46] away from the blessed thing that led
[1:15:48] them to this life and be perverted off
[1:15:51] of some kind of Creed and become popular
[1:15:53] or get to what they call a better class
[1:15:55] of people why you're in the best class
[1:15:57] there is sons and daughters of God I
[1:16:01] like that company better than I wouldn't
[1:16:04] be in the presence of kings and
[1:16:06] potentates or anyone else on the earth
[1:16:08] give me that kind of people that humble
[1:16:11] bunch of people they don't know their
[1:16:12] right hand from the left but as long as
[1:16:14] they know God and they serve Him that is
[1:16:20] a celebrity of heaven Oh Lord of God
[1:16:25] these are movie stars want to have that
[1:16:27] red carpet walk and they want to address
[1:16:29] something whole can you imagine what
[1:16:31] that day is gonna be like I'm looking at
[1:16:34] some celebrities here tonight
[1:16:36] celebrities not of this world it's going
[1:16:38] to fade away not of this world that one
[1:16:40] day their Purdy in the next day they're
[1:16:42] a bunch of cankered nothing's or one day
[1:16:44] they're painted up Jezebel's and they
[1:16:46] would take that off you'd be scared to
[1:16:48] look at him but I'm looking at true
[1:16:50] celebrities
[1:16:52] Amen celebrities in God's Hall of Fame
[1:16:55] that when Noah would turn away and would
[1:16:58] not reason the Word of God but he would
[1:17:00] go forward day after day after day he
[1:17:03] didn't try to answer all the questions
[1:17:04] could you imagine the questions that
[1:17:06] were there thousands of questions what
[1:17:09] do you mean how's it going to be this we
[1:17:11] talking about here know what you lied
[1:17:12] about this you said it was going to do
[1:17:13] this in Inked life you've done all that
[1:17:15] not all kind of he just turned away from
[1:17:17] all of that and put another nail in cut
[1:17:20] another board because he'd heard God's
[1:17:23] Word he had a commission he has
[1:17:26] something that he was not leaning or
[1:17:28] what he maybe he didn't I know he didn't
[1:17:30] understand at all
[1:17:31] he couldn't have understood at all with
[1:17:34] this human ability but he had heard from
[1:17:36] another land he had heard from another
[1:17:38] dimension and God told him how to build
[1:17:40] a boat what to build it out of what were
[1:17:43] to put each plane the dimensions thereof
[1:17:46] how tall how wide and he just went
[1:17:48] according to what God plans and here the
[1:17:50] question came and the question came and
[1:17:52] question can he just kept on going kept
[1:17:54] on going until one day he walked into
[1:17:57] that boat and the door shut and they
[1:18:01] were still hollering out questions and
[1:18:03] mocking and making fun but all of a

[1:19:10] hey man could you imagine Abraham
[1:19:12] leaning to think you told you told my

[1:19:19] have a baby

[1:19:22] what I thought I got your birth
[1:19:26] certificate I got proof here how old you
[1:19:29] are they didn't matter they had all the
[1:19:32] facts but the facts wouldn't the truth

[1:19:40] it didn't matter what the facts said
[1:19:43] come on somebody the truth said you're
[1:19:46] gonna have a son but what about Sarah

[1:19:51] who said you're gonna have it by Sarah
[1:19:52] just ready is that you're gonna have it
[1:19:53] by Sarah Sarah came into the prophecy
[1:19:56] how old is shaver hell jeez this old
[1:19:59] that's what I thought got the proofs
[1:20:02] here I got that I got the facts here
[1:20:04] it's impossible we got scientific proof
[1:20:06] and facts it's impossible for an old man
[1:20:09] or a woman this way past he's been there
[1:20:11] amen she never has no life how you gonna
[1:20:14] ha ha ha ha but that wasn't the truth
[1:20:18] a mare Abraham just kept walking he kept
[1:20:21] going forward he was walking in a vision
[1:20:23] he was walking in the center Lord you
[1:20:26] can say well I know Abraham make
[1:20:28] mistakes I know him had faults and he
[1:20:30] had failures yes he did but I look over
[1:20:32] here in the New Testament they don't
[1:20:34] mention not one of them he said hey bruh
[1:20:36] ham staggered not at the promise of God
[1:20:37] but was strong in the faith he kept
[1:20:40] going he wasn't worried about the
[1:20:41] question cuz it wasn't his question it
[1:20:44] was the devil's questions he kept going
[1:20:48] forward and one day he took that last
[1:20:51] step and back to a young man he went
[1:20:54] Laura departing the high Sarah behind
[1:20:57] and took that same step back to young
[1:21:00] woman again that was the truth and the
[1:21:03] truth was vindicated Isaac came forth
[1:21:06] [Applause]
[1:21:10] hallelujah he didn't linger zone
[1:21:13] understanding looking at his own body
[1:21:15] dead said about he dead he didn't look
[1:21:18] at that he looked at what the truth said
[1:21:23] hello
[1:21:24] don't you understand the truth it's not
[1:21:28] a fact the truth is a person that's the
[1:21:35] only thing that's really true is him
[1:21:41] he believed instead of unbelieving he
[1:21:45] caught that those things which are not
[1:21:47] as though they were which was absolutely
[1:21:50] against human reason he didn't reason it
[1:21:53] he just believed it
[1:21:55] there was no reason that could be proved
[1:21:57] that the baby would be born the woman
[1:22:00] was about 25 years past menopause her
[1:22:02] body was good as a dead he was a husband
[1:22:05] he was 100 years old and here he was
[1:22:07] still giving God praise 25 years later
[1:22:09] against all kinds of understanding but
[1:22:13] by faith he knew God the truth would
[1:22:17] keep the truth hallelujah what a Joshua
[1:22:24] would have leaned is on to understanding
[1:22:26] when he's fighting he just spoke it and
[1:22:29] said let the son you stay there among
[1:22:31] you don't move questions but the truth
[1:22:35] spoke hey man you don't lean on do you
[1:22:40] understanding when you're sick are you
[1:22:42] sitting in the wheelchair you're dying
[1:22:44] with cancer or heart trouble doctor says
[1:22:46] you're gonna die if you lean to your
[1:22:48] understanding you'll die but you don't
[1:22:51] lean to that you don't lean to what the
[1:22:54] mind can say and how how it can prove
[1:22:56] this or prove that you don't you don't
[1:22:58] lean to know that you keep going on
[1:23:01] forward what if David would have
[1:23:05] listened to Saul's the ology Goliath
[1:23:09] would overtake in their story no doubt
[1:23:11] would have been wrote different but in
[1:23:14] lean to what he understood he leaned to
[1:23:16] an experience I've been with God I know
[1:23:20] what he can do and if he can do it on a
[1:23:22] bear he can do it against the lioness
[1:23:24] for listening ain't nothing to him
[1:23:26] hey man amen that's what we have to do
[1:23:30] tonight you cannot lean to your own
[1:23:31] understanding but he goes on so many
[1:23:39] Mary questions
[1:23:44] won't a STONER because he's having a
[1:23:48] baby out of wedlock not knowing this is
[1:23:52] a very life of God men and their own
[1:23:57] understanding trying to kill God hello
[1:24:01] somebody still doing it today
[1:24:05] she never leaned her own understanding
[1:24:08] that am at one we could have a baby
[1:24:10] without a husband she just said be it
[1:24:13] unto me according to the truth how am I
[1:24:19] going to do it
[1:24:20] she didn't say how am I going to do it
[1:24:22] when will I do it houses going to take
[1:24:24] place the Angels God said the Holy Ghost
[1:24:27] overshadow thee and that holy thing will
[1:24:29] be born of thee shall be called the son
[1:24:31] of God she said Behold the hands maiden
[1:24:34] of the Lord
[1:24:34] she didn't take a reason it's said it
[1:24:37] couldn't be done
[1:24:38] she said Here I am take me Lord
[1:24:41] what about the woman with the blood
[1:24:42] issue doctor says there's no hope it's
[1:24:45] over you're good as dead got weaker all
[1:24:48] the time but by faith there's no
[1:24:50] scripture telling her if I could just
[1:24:52] touch the hem of her garment him of his
[1:24:54] garment but by faith she slipped around
[1:24:56] and touched him she walked back and sit
[1:24:58] down jesus said who touched me look
[1:25:00] around till they found her she felt at
[1:25:02] that moment her own body she couldn't
[1:25:04] prove it then but she felt something
[1:25:05] take place
[1:25:06] she didn't reason she didn't worry about
[1:25:08] it she just went on in faith and the
[1:25:11] Bible said he is now the high priest
[1:25:13] that can be touched with the feeling of
[1:25:16] our infirmities but if you can get
[1:25:18] beyond all that reason and then doubt
[1:25:19] and just reach out by faith then the
[1:25:22] same high priest will touch you
[1:25:27] hallelujah my goodness
