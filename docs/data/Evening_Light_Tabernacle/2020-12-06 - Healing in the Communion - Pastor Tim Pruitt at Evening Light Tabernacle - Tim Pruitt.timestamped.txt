[18:17] congregation that i had something very

[19:26] need supplier and we believe
[19:28] and we confess we ask in the name of
[19:31] jesus
[19:33] as we read the word together tonight may
[19:36] our hearts be just enjoined
[19:38] with the word until us in the word
[19:41] become the same
[19:42] until we believe the word just as is
[19:45] written and we speak it as it is to be
[19:49] spoken
[19:50] in jesus name amen god bless you
[19:54] thank you we're going to turn to
[19:57] psalms 105 and verse 37 i have one verse
[20:01] of scripture for um
[20:05] from this psalms here there's a lot more
[20:07] that we could read of course
[20:09] and then we will turn to the familiar
[20:11] scripture in first corinthians 11
[20:14] verse 23 but for now psalms 105 verse
[20:17] 37.
[20:19] i want to just say while you're turning
[20:22] there
[20:22] thank you very much for the wonderful
[20:24] thanksgiving christmas dinner that we
[20:26] had
[20:27] today we so appreciated all of your
[20:30] participation in it
[20:31] we got the best cooks in the whole wide
[20:33] world ain't nothing like
[20:35] southern cooking i guess you heard me
[20:37] say that right there ain't nothing like
[20:39] it
[20:40] amen so we certainly appreciate you and
[20:43] your contribution and this time that
[20:46] we've had to share together i didn't get
[20:48] to speak to every person
[20:50] but i'll tell you i love every one of
[20:52] you god bless you psalms 105 verse 37
[20:56] he brought them forth also with silver
[20:59] and gold and there was not one
[21:02] feeble person among their tribes
[21:10] read it with me will you he brought
[21:13] them forth also with silver and gold
[21:16] and there was not one feeble person
[21:20] among their
[21:21] tribes first corinthians 11
[21:25] 23
[21:28] for i have received of the lord that
[21:30] which also i delivered unto you that the
[21:32] lord jesus the same night in which he
[21:34] was betrayed took bread
[21:37] and when he had given thanks he break it
[21:39] and said
[21:40] tahit this is my body which is broken
[21:43] for you
[21:44] this do in remembrance of me after the
[21:47] same manner also he took the cup which
[21:50] when he accepts say in this cup is the
[21:53] new testament
[21:54] in my blood this do you as oft as you
[21:57] drink it
[21:58] in remembrance of me
[22:01] for as often as you eat this bread and
[22:04] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[22:06] death
[22:07] till he come wherefore whosoever
[22:10] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[22:12] of the lord
[22:13] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[22:16] and blood of the lord
[22:18] but let a man examine himself and so let
[22:20] him eat of that bread and drink
[22:22] of that cup for he that eateth and
[22:25] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[22:27] damnation
[22:28] to himself not discerning the lord's
[22:31] body
[22:32] and for this cause many are sweet and
[22:34] sickly among you and
[22:36] many sleep for if we would judge
[22:39] ourselves
[22:40] we should not be judged but when we are
[22:42] judged we are chastened to the lord
[22:44] that we should not be condemned with the
[22:46] world
[22:47] wherefore my brethren when you come
[22:49] together to eat terry one for the other
[22:52] amen god bless you you can have your
[22:54] seats
[22:56] now as we come to this particular
[22:59] service tonight it's something that
[23:02] i've had on my heart for a long time to
[23:04] share with you and to speak about
[23:07] we're going to be speaking on healing in
[23:09] the communion
[23:11] and i want to first of all read about
[23:14] four different quotes
[23:16] from brother branham before we go into
[23:18] the the scripture and the teaching of
[23:20] the word
[23:22] so that you will know that what i am
[23:24] ministering on tonight
[23:27] is something that is supported by the
[23:29] messenger
[23:31] and um brother branham would say this
[23:34] in jubilee year he said now we're going
[23:36] to have communion services
[23:38] in a few minutes how many believes in
[23:40] communion thank you that's what jesus
[23:42] christ asked us to do
[23:44] to take the broken parts of his body and
[23:47] do it until he returned again
[23:51] and if you believe this to be the truth
[23:53] and you'd like to have this little time
[23:54] of fellowship with us around the word of
[23:56] god here
[23:57] we'd be happy for you to stay with us
[23:58] and have this time if not
[24:00] we're going to dismiss just in a few
[24:02] moments we'd like you to stay
[24:04] with the with the rest in the house so
[24:07] that you'll be able to see the way we
[24:08] take the communion
[24:11] this is not only this is this is far
[24:14] also
[24:15] for divine healing did you know that
[24:19] when israel ate the type the lamb
[24:22] they passover they journeyed 40 years in
[24:24] the wilderness and come out
[24:26] without one feeble person in their midst
[24:30] think of that not one feeble person
[24:33] 40 years the communion a sign
[24:36] of believers and then he tells us in the
[24:40] message comforter
[24:41] he it's a in his prayer he says father
[24:45] we realize that when this was first
[24:47] ordered
[24:48] back yonder in the wilderness and back
[24:50] in egypt the paschal lamb was slain they
[24:53] journeyed 40 years and there wasn't a
[24:55] feeble one among the
[24:56] 2 million that came out you kept them in
[25:00] health while they taken the passover
[25:03] oh god heal every sick person
[25:06] that comes forward granted lord save
[25:10] every sinner fill every believer with
[25:11] the holy ghost and may the comforter
[25:13] abide
[25:14] until he's made flesh among us in the
[25:16] person of jesus christ again
[25:18] for we ask it in his name also in
[25:22] um another message the uh it's called
[25:25] the ordination he said
[25:27] you know that communion has divine
[25:29] healing in it
[25:31] when the israelites and type took the
[25:34] communion in march 40 years and when
[25:36] they came
[25:37] out of the wilderness there wasn't one
[25:40] feeble one among them two and a half
[25:43] million people there is power of
[25:46] healing in the communion
[25:50] and then in the message contest which
[25:52] will be in my final quote that i'll read
[25:54] tonight
[25:55] and we realized that in the communion
[25:58] there is strength
[26:00] israel took the communion first down in
[26:02] egypt
[26:03] and walked 40 years without their shoes
[26:06] wearing out or their clothes getting
[26:08] thread pair
[26:08] and out of two million people there
[26:10] wasn't a feeble one among them
[26:12] when they come out of the wilderness
[26:14] lord let us remember that tonight as we
[26:17] approach this great hour
[26:19] in jesus name we pray so all of these
[26:22] different quotations show us that
[26:25] that brother branham established that he
[26:28] believed there was
[26:30] there was um divine healing
[26:33] in communion i think of brother ron
[26:36] spencer when i shared with him my
[26:39] my text for tonight he's he shared back
[26:42] with me that his mother
[26:44] went through the communion with lying
[26:46] one time and
[26:47] she had um she had lumps in her breast
[26:50] and there went to the communion line
[26:52] claimed her healing and
[26:54] and um you know god completely totally
[26:57] did away with all the lumps in her
[26:59] breast because god's a healer
[27:02] amen and so tonight we're going to be
[27:05] speaking
[27:06] about healing divine healing in the
[27:09] lord's supper
[27:10] now god has an attitude towards sickness
[27:13] and he showed that attitude in jesus
[27:15] christ
[27:16] and and he showed that everywhere that
[27:20] jesus
[27:20] went he healed the sick he cast out
[27:24] devils
[27:24] he brought deliverance to god's people
[27:27] you see
[27:28] god places no value on sickness
[27:31] and he doesn't want you to suffer
[27:33] sickness for his glory
[27:36] sickness does not glorify god any more
[27:38] than sin glorifies god
[27:41] now its deliverance from sickness
[27:44] is what glorifies god when you are when
[27:47] you are delivered
[27:48] that brings glory to god but your
[27:50] sickness don't give god glory
[27:52] i hope you understand the difference now
[27:55] paul told the church at corinth that
[27:57] many were sick and weak and sickly among
[28:01] them because
[28:02] they were not discerning the lord's body
[28:06] and then he tells us the reason for this
[28:09] is
[28:10] and this is why again there's still so
[28:13] much sickness
[28:14] in the church today is because the
[28:16] church is not discerning the lord's body
[28:19] and just simple that you know it's not
[28:21] that god is purifying or glorifying his
[28:24] church through affliction
[28:25] it's not that god is testing his
[28:27] children's faith
[28:28] that's not the reason for it the reason
[28:31] we're having sickness in the church
[28:33] is because we're not discerning the
[28:36] lord's body
[28:37] this is what the bible teaches that
[28:40] we're failing to
[28:41] discern and realize what christ did for
[28:45] us at calvary now jesus
[28:48] told us to cast out demons of
[28:51] afflictions he did not tell us to live
[28:53] with them
[28:55] amen and since sickness is a demon it
[28:57] doesn't glorify god you ever hear of a
[28:59] demon glorifying god
[29:01] no so it doesn't glorify god for us to
[29:04] live with demons
[29:06] jesus commissioned us to cast them out
[29:09] that is the work the principal work of
[29:13] the church
[29:14] is to cast satan out amen now there
[29:17] there are two basic parts to the
[29:19] communion we have right here before us
[29:22] and there are two parts to it there is
[29:24] the bread there is the wine
[29:26] and so that and and the and of course
[29:29] for the passover there were
[29:30] two parts of the passover there was the
[29:33] blood of the lamb
[29:34] and the body of the lamb all right
[29:37] so sickness is due though when we
[29:40] when we fail to be taught about the body
[29:43] of christ
[29:45] that is represented by the bread like we
[29:47] have been taught about
[29:48] the blood of christ that is represented
[29:51] by the wine
[29:52] now we all know about the blood we know
[29:55] it cleanses us from sin
[29:57] is that right we understand the
[29:59] necessity
[30:01] of the wine representing the blood but
[30:03] do we
[30:04] understand what the bread is about
[30:07] do we understand why the bread i mean we
[30:10] have the part of the blood
[30:12] which is the life of the grapes that is
[30:14] squeezed out to make the wine
[30:16] and representing the life that was
[30:18] squeezed out of christ
[30:20] which is the holy spirit amen that that
[30:22] cleanses us from
[30:24] all sin are you with me but
[30:27] but again are we understanding what the
[30:30] bread is about
[30:32] are we really comprehending and
[30:34] accepting
[30:35] our deliverance as as was given
[30:39] by the sacrifice of jesus christ
[30:42] now why is it that there's so many um
[30:45] christians in the church that that is
[30:48] sick or infirm and suffering
[30:50] from the very diseases and the
[30:52] sicknesses that jesus christ
[30:54] our substitute has already paid for us
[30:58] amen he paid it in full did he not
[31:01] amen so again he he suffered that
[31:05] so we could be healed now i understand
[31:09] it's our mortality that
[31:11] why we are sick and as long as we're
[31:13] mortal there's going to be sickness
[31:16] but at the same time they we're dealing
[31:19] with something here to say
[31:20] there is also a remedy for that sickness
[31:23] and that's divine healing is that right
[31:27] now paul would say it was the lack of
[31:29] understanding of the lord's body
[31:31] as represented by the blood and so we're
[31:34] i'm disposing the question
[31:36] do we really comprehend are we coming
[31:38] with revelation
[31:40] of what the bread means
[31:43] you see the there the church at corinth
[31:47] it was a very small church probably
[31:50] maybe
[31:51] 15 20 people i'm not sure what the
[31:53] number of them we hear that
[31:54] ephesus ephesians church was 12. but
[31:58] how many corinthians was i'm not sure
[32:00] but it wasn't a large church
[32:02] perhaps it it was not not nearly the
[32:06] size of our
[32:07] congregation here today but there were
[32:10] many that was weak and sickly members
[32:15] many of them were sick and others
[32:18] were dying prematurely
[32:22] now you know the church in the
[32:25] wilderness
[32:26] in contrast was a much larger church
[32:30] it was a congregation of about 3 million
[32:34] now if you didn't like big churches you
[32:36] wouldn't want to be a part of moses
[32:38] church
[32:40] hello amen so he had about 3
[32:44] million yet in this church there was not
[32:46] one
[32:47] feeble person among their tribes
[32:50] how many believes that amen i believe it
[32:54] the bible has said not one feeble member
[32:57] among their tribe three million
[33:01] and yet here are two churches one in the
[33:04] old testament
[33:05] the other in the new testament wonder
[33:07] under law
[33:08] the other under grace one under the
[33:10] covenant of the blood of
[33:12] bulls and goats and another under the
[33:14] covenant sealed by
[33:15] a much greater blood the blood of christ
[33:20] amen this blood is a tremendous
[33:24] blood it's a tremendous worth
[33:28] the blood of millions of sheep and goat
[33:31] could never take away sin
[33:33] can only cover sin it could not take
[33:36] away sin
[33:38] somebody with me but the blood of jesus
[33:40] christ can take away the sin of the
[33:42] whole world
[33:44] so in comparison there there is
[33:47] the worth of the blood of god the blood
[33:49] of jesus christ was
[33:51] what's a way in estimate worth
[33:54] because it covers the sins of the whole
[33:57] world of every individual
[34:00] now so again yet
[34:03] there was not one sick
[34:06] or feeble person among these three
[34:09] million people
[34:11] who lived under the old covenant
[34:14] they were and that old covenant was
[34:16] established with the blood of bulls and
[34:18] goats
[34:19] and yet on the other hand there was many
[34:23] that was see sick and weakly among the
[34:27] that small church of corinthians
[34:30] and they lived under a new covenant and
[34:32] it was established by the blood of jesus
[34:35] christ
[34:36] it was a greater covenant it was a
[34:37] greater blood
[34:39] it was a greater power but yet these
[34:42] christians were not enjoying the
[34:45] benefits
[34:46] of what the covenant provided
[34:50] now surely there was something that was
[34:52] lacking at the corinthian church i mean
[34:54] something
[34:55] it may have no doubt is even lacking
[34:57] today
[34:58] when when we see the sick is not healed
[35:02] i'm going to say to you it is very very
[35:04] wrong
[35:05] for the sick not to be healed very wrong
[35:09] when we bring up the sick before us i'm
[35:11] quoting brother branham i told you i
[35:12] wouldn't read another but here's one
[35:14] when we bring up the sycamore before us
[35:17] and we
[35:18] and they fail to be healed he says we
[35:20] need to call a solemn fast
[35:22] call an assembly something's wrong
[35:24] somewhere god made a promise
[35:26] god's got to stick to that promise and
[35:29] he
[35:30] will do it
[35:33] so this is this is what he he lays it
[35:36] out when we have the sick
[35:37] and they're not healed i mean we need to
[35:40] qualify
[35:41] solemn fast because we're not coming
[35:42] right at the promise
[35:45] amen now for 400 years
[35:49] the children of israel had lived down in
[35:51] egypt
[35:53] egypt had made slaves out of god's
[35:55] people
[35:56] they had many many difficult years of
[35:59] of slavery and these years passed while
[36:02] they
[36:03] served as slaves down in a healing
[36:06] nation and
[36:07] spent long hours crying in prayer
[36:10] for deliverance but one day
[36:14] it came time the iniquity of the
[36:17] amorites became
[36:19] full amen it was time now for god to
[36:22] cleanse that land and bring another
[36:24] people in
[36:26] and god heard their groanings and god
[36:28] remembered
[36:29] the covenant that he made with abraham
[36:32] with isaac and with jacob
[36:34] and god looked upon the children of
[36:36] israel and
[36:37] god had respect toward them you remember
[36:40] that in the bible god chose a man by the
[36:42] name of moses
[36:44] to whom he said i have surely seen
[36:47] the affliction of my people which are in
[36:49] egypt
[36:50] and i've heard their cry but the reason
[36:53] of the task
[36:54] masters and i know they're sorrows
[36:57] and i am come down to deliver them
[37:00] and i'll tell you when god comes down
[37:02] something's going to happen
[37:04] that's why when we've been preaching
[37:06] about revelation 10
[37:08] one you know it's god coming down for a
[37:11] specific purpose here in this end time
[37:14] amen so god said so moses said come now
[37:17] therefore
[37:18] and i'll send you to pharaoh that you
[37:20] may bring
[37:21] my people out of it out of egypt
[37:24] well i want you to know tonight god
[37:26] still hears the prayers of his people
[37:29] amen oh yes in fact to the the
[37:32] the matter if you remember this morning
[37:34] and as we were reading of revelation 5
[37:37] the saints those 4 and 20 elders was
[37:40] holding
[37:41] prayers golden vows full of odors which
[37:44] were
[37:44] prayers of the saints but if we'd have
[37:47] studied a little further and look in
[37:48] revelation 8 we would have seen the
[37:50] seventh seal
[37:51] and the prayers are poured out and
[37:53] they're mixed with incense and they come
[37:55] in the presence of god
[37:57] god had a you see there were prayers
[38:00] that were prayed
[38:01] and none of them goes unanswered
[38:04] yet some could not be answered in their
[38:06] time
[38:07] many had prayed even the last prayer
[38:09] that john the
[38:10] revelator prayed he prayed even so come
[38:13] lord jesus
[38:14] well he couldn't come in that age and
[38:16] time he had you in mind
[38:19] so there was there was many generations
[38:22] of his offspring that he would see
[38:24] and so he held them up they were stored
[38:27] and shown is stored up in a vial or a
[38:29] bowl
[38:30] and they're held there until that he
[38:33] breaks the silence
[38:35] under the seventh seal and what he does
[38:37] he pours out
[38:38] the prayers of the saints for his coming
[38:41] and it is mixed with the the the
[38:45] incense and then it comes up into the
[38:47] presence of god
[38:48] and god then starts with with with the
[38:51] bible says with thunderings and
[38:53] lightning
[38:54] and earthquakes upon the earth and an
[38:56] upheaval begins as the seventh seal
[38:58] opens
[38:58] breaking the silence of his coming and
[39:01] the coming of the lord
[39:02] begins to be in motion and friend you
[39:05] are living in that
[39:06] time where the coming of the lord is in
[39:12] progress
[39:15] but it's only now in this day that he
[39:17] can answer those prayers
[39:20] so now they're mixed with the prayers
[39:22] the prayers are mixed with the incense
[39:24] and rise up into his presence received
[39:26] by god
[39:27] and in response to it he sends elijah
[39:29] the prophet
[39:30] as promised in malachi 4 to turn the
[39:33] hearts of the children back to the faith
[39:35] of the fathers to prepare a people
[39:37] for the coming of the lord i say glory
[39:40] to god
[39:42] god has not forgotten his people
[39:45] you're in a day you are living in a day
[39:48] of god's remembrance
[39:53] he's remembering every promise that he
[39:55] ever made
[39:56] and he's going to bring the past that
[39:58] which he has prophesied and said through
[40:00] the word
[40:01] down to the ages now but god still hears
[40:05] the prayers
[40:06] of those in bondage he speaks his same
[40:10] words to everyone who needs to deliver
[40:12] it says i am i am come down
[40:15] i am here to deliver
[40:18] did we see that in the prophetical
[40:20] ministry of brother branham we saw
[40:22] god present here to deliver
[40:26] amen then our message must not be any
[40:28] different from that
[40:29] god is here for the purpose of
[40:31] deliverance
[40:32] now moses would obey god's call
[40:36] to deliver god's people he showed many
[40:39] signs and wonders down in egypt
[40:41] and the final step came and god said to
[40:45] him
[40:45] i want you to speak to the children of
[40:48] israel
[40:50] and what i want you to do is tell them
[40:52] to take every one of them
[40:54] every man a lamb and kill it i want you
[40:56] to take the blood
[40:58] and i want you to strike it on the two
[41:00] sides of the of the post
[41:02] and the upper door posts of the house
[41:04] and then i want you to eat
[41:06] the flesh of the lamb it is the lord's
[41:10] passover
[41:12] so this would be you know some one of
[41:15] the
[41:15] final things that god would do before
[41:17] they left egypt
[41:19] he would give them the token of his
[41:21] blood
[41:22] and that blood would be the protection
[41:26] against the death angel that was in the
[41:28] land
[41:30] are you with me now again we are here
[41:34] now in another end time and god has
[41:37] provided a token
[41:38] of his blood somebody with me
[41:42] amen this token of his blood is to
[41:44] protect us
[41:45] from the death angel amen i'm not
[41:49] talking about covet 19 i'm talking about
[41:51] sin and the unbelief of sin
[41:55] are you with me no but it is a time
[41:58] where the token must be displayed
[42:05] it couldn't be just kept in a pot in the
[42:07] house
[42:09] it had to be displayed on the doorpost
[42:15] everyone entered that house would have
[42:16] to come under the token
[42:18] of that blood the sign of that blood
[42:22] that sign would say there is a lamb that
[42:24] died in this house
[42:27] a lamb has already provided the
[42:29] atonement and death is already here
[42:35] now
[42:39] brother branham said this about the
[42:40] token again
[42:42] i forgot to have another one but here's
[42:44] another one from the token
[42:46] where he says when peter and john passed
[42:48] through the gate called beautiful
[42:50] there were laid a man that had been
[42:52] crippled lame from his mother's womb and
[42:54] said silver and gold have
[42:55] none but such as i have i give you in
[42:58] the name of jesus christ and nazis
[43:00] rise up and walk and they talk to them
[43:03] and they knew that they were ignorant
[43:04] and unlearned men and they
[43:06] but they had taken them notice to them
[43:08] they had been with jesus
[43:10] you see the token was there
[43:13] displaying such as i have
[43:18] now we get an understanding of the
[43:20] displaying of the holy ghost
[43:22] the token must be on display there must
[43:24] be have
[43:25] somebody have something to give
[43:29] to those that are suffering and in need
[43:32] to bring deliverance are you with me
[43:35] now so that token was their display in
[43:37] such as i have
[43:38] see a poor fallen brother laying there
[43:41] crippled and disfigured and everything
[43:44] and the same light that was in christ
[43:46] was in them
[43:47] such as i have in the my name you shall
[43:50] cast out devil not i will
[43:52] you will if you say this mountain not if
[43:54] i say but if you say to this mountain
[43:57] amen oh brother the hour of that token
[44:00] to be displayed
[44:02] is at hand
[44:05] we can see it we know we're at the end
[44:08] we've brought up all kinds of messages
[44:10] to show the
[44:11] the signs and wonders and now we're here
[44:13] and we come
[44:14] we come back for what the church has got
[44:16] to do the token
[44:18] has to be displayed
[44:22] so there has to come a time when the
[44:24] blood of christ
[44:25] is on display come on where the life of
[44:29] jesus christ
[44:30] is on display in a people and it will be
[44:33] manifested
[44:34] by the signs and wonders that follows
[44:36] them that believe
[44:39] now so we are in a time of displaying
[44:43] the token understand it
[44:46] must be displayed now
[44:50] they had applied the blood but they also
[44:53] ate the flesh
[44:54] there were two things they were
[44:56] commanded to do apply the blood the lamb
[44:58] and eat the flesh of the lamb now most
[45:02] don't realize the this eating of the
[45:05] lamb
[45:05] it's just as important as the partaking
[45:08] of the blood
[45:10] so the destroyer would pass through
[45:12] egypt and
[45:13] slay the firstborn in every family which
[45:16] was a type of
[45:17] spiritual death which comes to every
[45:19] person outside of god's covenant
[45:22] and and again you know the destroyer
[45:24] would pass through
[45:25] but they were protected under the blood
[45:28] but i want you to know
[45:29] there was not just one step there were
[45:31] two steps
[45:34] just like with this communion there's
[45:36] not just one element there's two
[45:38] elements
[45:39] there is blood and there's bread
[45:43] now get these down get these things in
[45:45] mind we're pointing out
[45:47] about the communion tonight
[45:51] these two steps that israel had to do
[45:54] first
[45:55] there was to be a lamb slain its blood
[45:58] was to be applied to the doorposts of
[46:00] every house
[46:03] it was identified them as being
[46:06] under god's covenant of protection
[46:10] god said the blood shall be for you for
[46:12] a token
[46:14] where you are and when i see the blood
[46:17] i will pass over you how many remembers
[46:20] that
[46:20] amen and the plague shall not come upon
[46:23] you to destroy you you see
[46:25] this represents and type our
[46:28] identification
[46:29] by faith with the blood of jesus christ
[46:32] the lamb
[46:34] so now we're being justified by faith
[46:38] by his blood we are safe from the wrath
[46:40] that is to come
[46:42] amen so that's number one but number two
[46:45] second thing is every israelite had to
[46:49] eat
[46:49] the lamb's flesh amen
[46:53] and this was for a different reason this
[46:56] was not for protection from sin
[46:58] nor the death angel this was for
[47:01] physical
[47:02] strength for the journey
[47:07] eating the lamb was for physical
[47:10] strength
[47:12] eating drinking the or
[47:16] applying the blood was to protect him
[47:19] from the death angel
[47:21] but eating the lamb was
[47:24] for the strength for the journey
[47:28] amen for physical strength if the
[47:30] deliverance from
[47:32] slavery then meant healing for the body
[47:34] also
[47:35] did delivery tonight from the slavery of
[47:38] sin
[47:38] must provide for healing also
[47:42] you can't have one without the other
[47:45] amen if you've got if you got the wine
[47:48] you got to have the bread to go with it
[47:50] if you got the blood of the lamb you got
[47:52] to have the body of the lamb to go with
[47:54] it
[47:55] so you see there has to be divine
[47:58] healing
[47:58] that is included in the promise
[48:03] now if it was in the passover then
[48:07] and we now have a greater lamb and a
[48:09] greater passover
[48:11] then healing must be provided in this
[48:14] passover
[48:18] eating the lamb's flesh had nothing to
[48:20] do with the passing of the
[48:21] destroyer the blood was the sign of the
[48:24] token
[48:26] when i see the blood i'll pass over you
[48:29] you see the destroyer had no authority
[48:32] to touch that house
[48:34] amen israel was beginning a journey and
[48:38] as they started that journey which is a
[48:40] type
[48:40] of our own christian journey amen god
[48:43] planned that his children for that
[48:45] journey would be
[48:46] well and to be strong for this journey
[48:50] and i want you to know tonight that's
[48:51] still god's plan
[48:54] god wants you to be well god wants you
[48:57] to be healthy
[48:58] god wait god wants a people that
[49:02] believes his word and proclaims that
[49:04] word
[49:05] for our own healing and deliverance
[49:08] it's god's desire for you said third
[49:10] john 1 and 2 said
[49:11] beloved i wish above all things that
[49:14] might
[49:14] prosper and be in health even as i soul
[49:16] prospers
[49:18] god wants you to be well
[49:23] it's the wrong thinking god wants you to
[49:25] suffer
[49:26] god wants you to be healed amen
[49:30] so while this is for god's glory it
[49:32] might result in god's glory
[49:34] but god don't get any glory out of you
[49:36] being sick
[49:38] god gets glory when you're healed
[49:42] amen now the lamb's body when they ate
[49:45] it
[49:46] it became their body think of that
[49:49] what happened to what happened to the
[49:51] flesh of that animal here they eat the
[49:53] lamb
[49:54] by the justin the food it sent right
[49:56] into the bloodstream and
[49:58] its chemical essence becomes flesh of
[50:01] our flesh and
[50:02] bone of our bone and skin of our skin
[50:04] and body of our body
[50:05] it becomes a part of us
[50:09] the flesh or the body of the lamb slain
[50:13] in egypt was eaten and when it was eaten
[50:16] it became a part
[50:19] of every israelite it became
[50:22] their flesh their bones their skin
[50:25] their body it's a type
[50:28] of the body of jesus christ who became
[50:31] the slain
[50:32] lamb now
[50:35] paul said that we by faith we we have
[50:38] become
[50:38] members of the body of his flesh
[50:42] and of his bones we partake of that same
[50:45] body of christ and type
[50:47] every time we take the bread of the
[50:49] communion service
[50:51] if you listen to brother branham in the
[50:54] great shining light
[50:55] he said thou shalt say in thy heart
[50:58] disease move from my child
[51:02] and this is the way i want you to
[51:03] approach the communion tonight
[51:06] you'll be saying in your heart disease
[51:09] you move from my child
[51:14] disease move from my body
[51:18] in the name of the lord jesus and don't
[51:20] doubt
[51:21] and right there good germs
[51:24] take on new armor and new weapons
[51:28] and the enemy begins to back up he is
[51:31] defeated because
[51:32] christ in the drinking of his murder at
[51:34] calvary
[51:35] defeated the devil and every one of his
[51:37] power and he stripped him of everything
[51:39] he had
[51:40] and he's nothing but a bluff
[51:44] somebody ought to said hallelujah amen
[51:47] what what did
[51:48] he said when you when you begin to pray
[51:51] and believe
[51:52] and you begin to say disease move from
[51:55] my child
[51:56] move from my body he said good germs
[52:00] amen begin to take on new armor
[52:04] and begin to get in a new weapon and the
[52:07] enemy begins to back up
[52:11] you know god designs your body to heal
[52:13] itself
[52:15] that when cancer comes in it's to have
[52:18] is to have the
[52:19] the the different i don't know the
[52:21] medical terms but
[52:22] i'll just use for the term just uh just
[52:25] for a lay boy's
[52:27] explanation the antibodies in your body
[52:30] begins to work
[52:32] begins to throw out the the bad sails
[52:34] begin to conquer them
[52:36] come on amen that's exactly what happens
[52:39] and when we begin to pray
[52:41] god begins to cause a something to stir
[52:45] within your
[52:46] body that awakens your own immune system
[52:50] to throw out that disease
[52:57] that's what's going to happen tonight
[52:58] when you come to this communion
[53:01] god's going to anoint your body to start
[53:04] throwing out the disease and the
[53:05] affliction that's bothering it
[53:07] [Applause]
[53:13] now faith recognizes that fact it claims
[53:15] the promised benefits
[53:17] because jesus was beaten for me
[53:22] in death which
[53:26] which bore all our physical infirmities
[53:29] our pains our diseases
[53:31] and weakness like i said at calvary you
[53:34] know when he
[53:35] when he was took those stripes when he
[53:38] was beat on the head with a rod
[53:42] amen for everyone that had a headache or
[53:46] that has a headache
[53:47] or is troubled with headaches are you
[53:50] here tonight
[53:51] amen jesus took the beatings on his head
[53:55] and received headaches
[53:58] in your stead
[54:01] so that you could be healed you say i've
[54:04] got back pain he took stripes on his
[54:07] back
[54:08] so that your back could be healed you
[54:11] say i've got footprints he took
[54:13] the nails in his feet so that
[54:16] by what he suffered at calvary
[54:19] you could be free from the sickness that
[54:22] wants to come against
[54:24] your body for by whose stripes
[54:27] we were healed
[54:29] [Applause]
[54:33] is that the word or isn't it the word
[54:36] now the israelites would eat the lamb's
[54:38] body they would begin their journey the
[54:40] very next day
[54:42] and as they journeyed their sickness
[54:43] vanished
[54:45] their infirmities disappeared they were
[54:47] physically strong and whole
[54:51] oh granny's sitting there in the corner
[54:53] there laying on her death bed and
[54:55] about to be you know there's planning
[54:57] her funeral because
[54:58] she wouldn't make it on this journey
[55:02] she took a bite of that lamb the
[55:04] strength of that lamb came in her
[55:06] and she got up shouting i ain't going to
[55:08] take nothing for my journey now
[55:10] i'm going to this promised land with the
[55:12] rest of you
[55:15] i'm telling you there was not one feeble
[55:18] one
[55:19] among them
[55:25] no one was sick no one was feeble
[55:29] no one was weak every one of them
[55:32] among them was strong and well and
[55:34] healthy
[55:35] they'd eaten the lamb's body
[55:38] and that body had become a part of their
[55:41] own body
[55:42] and three million people and there
[55:45] wasn't a feeble one among them
[55:47] that i read that in the bible
[55:52] you've got to believe that if you
[55:54] believe jesus rose then you know that
[55:56] same power happened
[55:59] that 3 million went on their journey
[56:02] and not a feeble one that's an
[56:05] incredible
[56:07] brother branham would preach a sermon
[56:08] called dr moses
[56:11] and he said i wonder what kind of
[56:13] prescription was in his bag
[56:15] he said every time they got sick he just
[56:17] reached in there and brought it out
[56:18] i am the lord god that heals all thy
[56:20] diseases i will put
[56:22] none of the diseases upon you that is
[56:24] put upon the egyptians
[56:28] you say well brother tim well you know
[56:30] y'all you got the covid and
[56:32] and yeah i had it had it for about a day
[56:35] my wife had it about six hours
[56:40] we got rid of it in a hurry
[56:44] amen i couldn't wait to see its tail run
[56:47] out of the house
[56:50] amen but i but we believed right we
[56:52] still profess
[56:53] right amen and i'm just going to say if
[56:56] your loved one is laying there
[56:57] sick and dying in the hospital right now
[57:00] he's the lord god that heals all
[57:02] diseases
[57:06] amen you need to claim that for them
[57:09] amen so they're there but but again
[57:13] he said i will put none of these
[57:16] diseases
[57:17] on you i want you to know god didn't
[57:20] give me covert 19
[57:24] but god took it off
[57:28] god doesn't give you infirmities but god
[57:31] would take them away
[57:34] amen god doesn't give you hereditary
[57:37] traits
[57:38] of sickness but he'll take him away
[57:43] amen god declared he would let no
[57:46] disease to come upon them as long as
[57:48] they were obedient to him and
[57:50] that's still his promise and he further
[57:52] promised
[57:53] he says the number of your days i will
[57:55] fulfill
[57:59] it's not a great promise it's even
[58:02] greater the older i get
[58:04] because the devil can't kill me till
[58:06] god's ready for me
[58:08] he can't take my life until god says
[58:10] your time's up
[58:12] amen and so he said the number of your
[58:15] days
[58:15] i will fulfill and that's still his
[58:18] promise in spite
[58:19] of how many at corinth died prematurely
[58:23] and then even more today are dying
[58:26] prematurely
[58:27] but all of god's promises are ready
[58:30] there for us to claim
[58:32] when we believe it now
[58:37] they must become ours personally
[58:41] again now to every believer born again
[58:45] child of god
[58:46] with death come stealing at your door
[58:48] prematurely
[58:50] the angel of god stands between you in
[58:52] the sickness
[58:54] and if you want to run right on to it
[58:56] that's your business but you don't have
[58:58] to
[59:00] he's standing between you and death
[59:03] and brother branham was paralyzing or
[59:06] are
[59:06] paralleling rather they did
[59:10] where israel was there at the red sea
[59:12] and here comes
[59:14] here comes the enemy right in behind
[59:16] them and going to destroy their life and
[59:18] what happened
[59:19] god stood between them
[59:23] and death the egyptians
[59:26] the pillar of fire was there between
[59:29] them
[59:30] and the egyptian and he says the angel
[59:32] of god
[59:33] stands between you and
[59:36] sickness
[59:40] amen and he said when death comes
[59:42] stealing to the door prematurely
[59:45] the angel of god stands between you and
[59:47] sickness now if you want to run right on
[59:49] to it
[59:49] that's your business but you don't have
[59:52] to
[59:54] that's why i said don't give up on the
[59:55] harvest
[59:57] because you'll reap if you think not now
[1:00:00] remember israel was not only applied the
[1:00:04] lamb's blood the doorpost which was a
[1:00:06] type of salvation from sin
[1:00:08] but they also ate the lamb's body
[1:00:12] and that is a type of healing from
[1:00:14] sickness
[1:00:16] you know sickness and sin that come from
[1:00:20] the fall they're kind of like twin evils
[1:00:24] sin said in the soul sickness said in
[1:00:26] the body
[1:00:28] sin and sickness there is designed to
[1:00:31] tear down to kill to destroy god's
[1:00:34] creation
[1:00:35] that's what they that's that's the work
[1:00:37] that they do but
[1:00:38] god provided in the ins to oppose
[1:00:42] this sin and sickness these twin evils
[1:00:45] god provided for us
[1:00:46] twin mercies and those twin mercies
[1:00:50] is salvation from sin and healing from
[1:00:53] sickness
[1:00:54] those are god's twin mercies
[1:00:58] amen and these mercies are to
[1:01:01] to give you the abundant life of jesus
[1:01:04] christ where you
[1:01:05] for your journey that you can enjoy
[1:01:07] god's blessings
[1:01:10] now when jesus became our substitute
[1:01:15] he bore our sins and our sickness
[1:01:18] he did this in order that we might be
[1:01:21] delivered from them and from their power
[1:01:25] and man he shed his blood for remission
[1:01:27] of sins and
[1:01:28] he put away our sickness and our
[1:01:30] infirmities
[1:01:32] so that we need to never suffer them
[1:01:35] again think about that
[1:01:38] jesus paid it all
[1:01:41] come on somebody you got to know this is
[1:01:44] the truth
[1:01:45] amen god when he provided that the
[1:01:47] atonement it was for sin and sickness
[1:01:50] alike
[1:01:53] he was not only to deliver there from
[1:01:55] the destroyer for the israelite but he
[1:01:57] was
[1:01:57] also the healer of their their diseases
[1:02:01] and in malachi malachi 3 and 6 he says
[1:02:04] i'm the lord thy god and i change not
[1:02:07] so if god provided in that exodus
[1:02:09] wouldn't god provide it in this exodus
[1:02:12] wouldn't his attitude be the same as
[1:02:15] when he walked on the shores of galilee
[1:02:17] toward sickness
[1:02:18] what shouldn't our attitude towards
[1:02:20] sickness be the same
[1:02:24] the bible said he healed them all
[1:02:31] is it wrong for us to think that god
[1:02:34] wants us to be well
[1:02:39] is that error every israelite would put
[1:02:43] the blood on the doorpost
[1:02:45] they were protected from the death angel
[1:02:48] the destroyer
[1:02:50] every israelite who ate the lamb's body
[1:02:55] were freed from sickness and were made
[1:02:57] well and strong and healthy
[1:03:00] this this has always been god's plan
[1:03:04] you know it's his plan for redemption
[1:03:07] for restoration salvation
[1:03:09] we we're to be brought back and restored
[1:03:12] listen the church has long forgotten
[1:03:15] that god is not just a savior he's a
[1:03:17] healer
[1:03:20] you know when david gave a praise unto
[1:03:22] god what is it psalms 104
[1:03:24] or something like that he said bless the
[1:03:26] lord of my soul and forget not all his
[1:03:28] benefits
[1:03:30] he said who he forgives all your
[1:03:33] iniquities that's the sin question
[1:03:37] and who heals all your diseases
[1:03:41] there's a sickness question provision
[1:03:44] has been
[1:03:44] made for deliverance for both sin and
[1:03:47] sickness
[1:03:49] by the same atonement
[1:03:52] we sang the song when i come out one of
[1:03:55] my favorites
[1:03:57] one that stirred my heart as a young boy
[1:04:00] where that i
[1:04:01] made one of my first moves for christ
[1:04:03] when i realized
[1:04:05] he was wounded from my transgressions
[1:04:08] he was bruised for my iniquity we were
[1:04:11] singing in
[1:04:12] in children's church he was wounded for
[1:04:16] my transgressions
[1:04:18] he was bruised for my iniquity and it so
[1:04:21] overwhelmed me
[1:04:22] the realization of what he did for me
[1:04:25] that i wept and cried and gave my heart
[1:04:28] to him
[1:04:30] isaiah prophesied in isaiah
[1:04:35] 53 that most wonderful scripture of
[1:04:38] redemption
[1:04:39] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:04:42] he was bruised for our iniquity all of
[1:04:45] that that's the sin question
[1:04:46] and with his stripes we were healed
[1:04:50] there's the sickness question so again
[1:04:53] we see
[1:04:54] in the atonement in the promise of
[1:04:56] atonement
[1:04:57] there was deliverance from both sin
[1:05:00] and sickness now of course you know when
[1:05:04] you're delivered in your soul
[1:05:05] from sin it's once and for all
[1:05:10] right you never lose your salvation but
[1:05:12] in your body it's mortal
[1:05:14] and until we get a new one we're going
[1:05:17] to be attacked
[1:05:18] all the time and it'd be like paul
[1:05:22] was you know where a messenger of satan
[1:05:24] would come and buffered him and so
[1:05:26] that means time after time after time he
[1:05:28] come and attacked and he attacked and he
[1:05:30] attacked
[1:05:31] and you get healed tonight and you'll
[1:05:33] get attacked again
[1:05:34] but he's still the lord and heals all
[1:05:42] when jesus began to preach the gospel of
[1:05:44] the kingdom
[1:05:46] he proved he was the healer of sickness
[1:05:49] as well as a forgiveness forgiver of
[1:05:51] sins
[1:05:53] how many knows that's what they wanted
[1:05:55] to crucify him over was
[1:05:57] he forgave sins to the man who was sick
[1:06:01] with the palsy you know what that was he
[1:06:02] was a paralytic
[1:06:04] and there with being unable to walk a
[1:06:06] paralytic jesus
[1:06:08] said to him son your sins are forgiven
[1:06:11] so he provided forgiveness we believe
[1:06:14] that don't we
[1:06:15] they didn't believe it then but we
[1:06:16] believe it now don't we and
[1:06:18] but he also said now to prove that i'm
[1:06:22] able to forgive sin
[1:06:23] said take up your bed and walk so you
[1:06:27] see the very proof of him able to save
[1:06:29] from sin
[1:06:30] is in divine healing
[1:06:34] because if he can heal your body
[1:06:38] he can certainly heal your soul
[1:06:44] now jesus ministered for three years
[1:06:49] and all of those three years he it was
[1:06:52] engaged in healing the sick
[1:06:54] and forgiving the sinful over and over
[1:06:56] and over again
[1:06:59] he would say god's sins are forgiven
[1:07:02] they would ask him you know in a very
[1:07:07] the only time that he was ever
[1:07:08] questioned about god's will for healing
[1:07:11] and there was a leper that come to him
[1:07:12] and said lord if it be your will
[1:07:14] will you heal me of my leprosies that i
[1:07:17] will
[1:07:18] be thou clean he showed right there
[1:07:22] that's his will his will is
[1:07:26] that the lepers be clean the crippled to
[1:07:28] walk
[1:07:30] the blind to see the death to hear
[1:07:33] to heal all manner of diseases and
[1:07:35] sickness
[1:07:38] then come that crucial time there at
[1:07:40] calvary that we preach about so much and
[1:07:43] the world preaches about
[1:07:44] he become our substitute he became
[1:07:50] oh i hate to say it but he became
[1:07:54] sinful with our sins
[1:07:59] the bible said he who knew no sin
[1:08:03] became our sins so that we could become
[1:08:07] his righteousness
[1:08:11] think about that how many believes
[1:08:13] tonight
[1:08:14] that your sins were laid on him
[1:08:17] at calvary that he paid
[1:08:20] for your sins you believe that
[1:08:24] but i want you to notice that not only
[1:08:27] would he
[1:08:28] become sinful with our sins
[1:08:31] but he who never had to be sick
[1:08:38] i'm letting that sink in
[1:08:41] because remember he in order to suffer
[1:08:44] for us
[1:08:46] he took on the form of the seed of
[1:08:48] abraham
[1:08:50] the likeness of man he didn't have to be
[1:08:53] sick
[1:08:55] he would be made sick
[1:08:59] for you
[1:09:03] just like he was made sin
[1:09:06] for your sins
[1:09:10] he was made sick for you
[1:09:18] both sin and sickness had to be taken
[1:09:20] away or put away
[1:09:22] but first the penalty for both had to be
[1:09:26] paid he would have to pay it
[1:09:28] you remember when man sinned immediately
[1:09:31] sickness came in
[1:09:32] he lost his immortality
[1:09:36] so redemption would have to include
[1:09:40] the redemption of the soul and the
[1:09:42] redemption of the body
[1:09:45] now we know jesus christ
[1:09:48] a worthy lamb he was the only one that
[1:09:51] could do this
[1:09:53] he did it the bible said he would do
[1:09:57] this because
[1:09:58] god so loved the world if i could make
[1:10:01] that personal
[1:10:02] god so loved you
[1:10:08] i mean you know really it's no good
[1:10:10] value to you as long as just to the
[1:10:12] world but
[1:10:12] it's got to become personal god so loved
[1:10:16] you he gave
[1:10:19] his only begotten son
[1:10:24] it was because of his love his love
[1:10:26] constrained him
[1:10:28] to bear your sins and bear your sickness
[1:10:35] at the passover the taking of the bread
[1:10:38] and the wine
[1:10:40] and you know he he tried to show his
[1:10:42] disciples
[1:10:44] what would be the effects of his
[1:10:45] suffering and that he would uh
[1:10:47] undergo and paul would relate it later
[1:10:50] you know when he and explain it even in
[1:10:53] more detail he says the lord jesus
[1:10:56] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:10:58] he took bread
[1:11:00] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:11:01] it and said to take heat
[1:11:04] this is my body which is broken
[1:11:07] for you this do in remembrance of me and
[1:11:11] after the
[1:11:12] same manner he also took the cup and
[1:11:14] when he accepts saying this cup
[1:11:16] is the new testament or the new covenant
[1:11:18] in my blood
[1:11:20] you know as often as you drink it
[1:11:24] remember me
[1:11:27] remember remember why you have this
[1:11:30] atonement
[1:11:33] because i dearly paid for it
[1:11:38] i paid it where you wouldn't have to be
[1:11:41] a sinner
[1:11:43] and i paid it so that when you're sick
[1:11:47] you could be healed
[1:11:53] probably this disciple sitting at the
[1:11:55] table with him didn't
[1:11:56] even know what was going on they didn't
[1:11:59] understand him when he spoke those words
[1:12:01] they didn't they didn't comprehend there
[1:12:04] was a lot of things they were missing
[1:12:06] a lot of hardness of their heart and
[1:12:07] unbelief and
[1:12:09] literally little could they expect what
[1:12:11] was coming
[1:12:12] but it came and it came for a reason it
[1:12:15] was for your deliverance in mind
[1:12:18] jesus would go to that awful place of
[1:12:21] calvary
[1:12:22] he would take beatens
[1:12:26] on your behalf the sufferings of christ
[1:12:30] was tremendous
[1:12:32] and i'm trying to get to you today it
[1:12:34] was for a purpose
[1:12:38] it would be the lamb dying in your place
[1:12:41] you were the guilty and you were the one
[1:12:45] deserving of death
[1:12:47] but the lamb died in your place same
[1:12:50] with israel
[1:12:52] israel had done just as many sins
[1:12:53] perhaps
[1:12:55] it doesn't really matter all sin and
[1:12:56] fall short of the glory of god
[1:12:58] israel they were they were a sinful
[1:13:01] people as well they were worthy of
[1:13:05] judgment and death
[1:13:07] but god provided the lamb to die in
[1:13:09] their place
[1:13:10] it wasn't because that they were
[1:13:12] innocent that they lived it was because
[1:13:14] that god allowed the innocent sea of the
[1:13:17] lamb to be
[1:13:18] accounted to them and so there was a
[1:13:22] death in their dwelling that's why the
[1:13:24] death angel would pass over
[1:13:27] now you know they're there again
[1:13:30] at calvary at the hands of cruel men
[1:13:34] terrible mocking jesus our lamb was
[1:13:37] beaten
[1:13:40] he was spit on bruised tortured
[1:13:44] his body there there would be deep furs
[1:13:48] that would be plowed in his back
[1:13:50] until parts of his bones of his spine
[1:13:54] and his ribs would show through
[1:13:56] he was lacerated with awful stripes of
[1:13:59] the
[1:14:00] by the roman lash
[1:14:04] you know only on his body
[1:14:07] there were stripes by which isaiah said
[1:14:11] by these stripes you
[1:14:14] were healed and peter would
[1:14:18] would agree with this and he would he
[1:14:20] would say the same thing
[1:14:22] by these rights
[1:14:25] he took this so you can be healed
[1:14:31] now this was not a sacrifice for our
[1:14:34] sins
[1:14:35] this was for the bearing of our sickness
[1:14:40] he would die for our sins but he would
[1:14:43] be beaten for our healing
[1:14:48] the stripes were laid on his body that
[1:14:50] very day think of this for a moment the
[1:14:52] day
[1:14:53] that he healed peter's mother-in-law of
[1:14:56] a fever
[1:14:58] that same evening in matthew 8 16 when
[1:15:01] the evening was come
[1:15:03] that brought him many that was possessed
[1:15:04] with devils and he cast out spirits
[1:15:07] with his word remember me preaching
[1:15:10] about speaking the word
[1:15:12] and healed somebody helped me preach
[1:15:15] all that were sick
[1:15:22] and that it might be fulfilled
[1:15:26] what was spoken by isaiah's the prophet
[1:15:28] saying
[1:15:29] himself took our infirmities and bear
[1:15:32] our sickness
[1:15:36] so they they they they striped him and
[1:15:41] bruised his body and the stripes by
[1:15:44] which were healed and
[1:15:45] they nailed him to a cross they
[1:15:48] pierced his side his his blood would run
[1:15:50] down to the ground
[1:15:52] and his blood was shed for many
[1:15:55] for the remission of sin do we believe
[1:15:57] that tonight
[1:15:59] amen but that blood was shed for
[1:16:02] sin not for the healing of sickness
[1:16:07] jesus our lamb suffered two weights
[1:16:11] he is he set his blood on the cross for
[1:16:13] our salvation from sin
[1:16:15] we got that amen we believe that
[1:16:18] but he bore the stripes on his body for
[1:16:21] healing from sickness
[1:16:23] he was atoning for both at the same time
[1:16:27] his blood shed for sin his body offered
[1:16:33] for your sickness
[1:16:39] now i know you've been here a long time
[1:16:40] today but haunted in just a few moments
[1:16:47] jesus would suffer
[1:16:51] intense agony at calvary
[1:16:54] until even
[1:16:57] even god himself the the father would
[1:16:59] turn away from him
[1:17:04] reject him the sinner
[1:17:09] bearing your sins he would scream out my
[1:17:12] god
[1:17:14] my god why hast thou forsaken me he
[1:17:18] became forsaken so
[1:17:21] you wouldn't have to be forsaken
[1:17:26] but you know in that excruciating pain
[1:17:30] and suffering that he that he bore down
[1:17:32] there at pilates hall and when he was
[1:17:34] beaten with fists and hands
[1:17:36] there with the jews and all that
[1:17:38] happened and he got all them
[1:17:40] those horrible roman lashes though he
[1:17:44] bore our sickness he was literally
[1:17:48] made sick for us
[1:17:58] so that by his stripes
[1:18:01] we could be healed
[1:18:08] keep this in mind
[1:18:12] let me emphasize it jesus was not only
[1:18:15] made sin for us
[1:18:17] he was made sick for us
[1:18:23] the bible said this is why he could be a
[1:18:26] proper mediator
[1:18:29] because there's nothing you go through
[1:18:30] that he couldn't say i've been through
[1:18:32] it
[1:18:33] you say i've faced rejection brother tim
[1:18:35] from from those
[1:18:37] my children from my family from this
[1:18:39] from that one from the i felt suffered
[1:18:41] rejection he did
[1:18:46] you say brother jim i i i go through
[1:18:50] i you know i've been called bad names
[1:18:53] and then and
[1:18:54] as a christian i take ridicule i i he
[1:18:57] did
[1:19:00] he did everything that he might be a
[1:19:02] proper mediator
[1:19:05] that he wouldn't be somebody who had
[1:19:07] sympathy with you
[1:19:09] but he had empathy with you in other
[1:19:11] words he could say
[1:19:13] i know how you feel
[1:19:16] i've been through that myself
[1:19:26] so that he could pull from god for you
[1:19:30] the deliverance you need
[1:19:34] i want you to my bear in mind and i
[1:19:37] preached on it before
[1:19:38] and we don't have time to preach
[1:19:40] everything that i could preach on this
[1:19:41] subject
[1:19:43] but jesus was also the scapegoat
[1:19:49] as the escaped goat would they would
[1:19:51] place all the sins of israel upon it
[1:19:54] and take it out in the wilderness and
[1:19:57] leave it alone by itself
[1:19:59] and his caretaker slip away and leave it
[1:20:01] there to be torn by the wild beast
[1:20:04] even so jesus went to hell for us
[1:20:10] and he was torn and ripped by all the
[1:20:12] demons of hell
[1:20:14] but on that resurrection morning
[1:20:17] he changed from being the victim
[1:20:20] hallelujah he changed from being the
[1:20:23] victim in hell to the mighty conqueror
[1:20:25] and he rose up from the grave free from
[1:20:28] the sin of man
[1:20:29] and the sickness he had borne and he
[1:20:32] showed that he is the mighty
[1:20:34] conqueror over every sickness listen
[1:20:38] when he come out of the grave
[1:20:39] there was no there was no crippledness
[1:20:44] there was no staggering there was no
[1:20:46] bleeding come on somebody
[1:20:48] there was no there was nothing left of
[1:20:51] the sickness
[1:20:52] it was gone
[1:20:55] because when he raised and he triumphed
[1:20:58] he was
[1:20:59] healed of all of death
[1:21:06] and he rose up the mighty conqueror over
[1:21:10] all of it
[1:21:11] not crippled not maimed not torn not
[1:21:14] bruised not sore
[1:21:19] he didn't walk with the men on the way
[1:21:20] to emmaus
[1:21:22] and say i know uh brothers
[1:21:25] i went to a pretty rough thing yesterday
[1:21:28] in my back here
[1:21:30] and i've been laying on a hard stone
[1:21:33] there
[1:21:34] in this grave he wouldn't didn't say
[1:21:36] none of that did he
[1:21:39] he walked among them whole
[1:21:42] healed delivered he was triumphed
[1:21:46] over cancer he was triumphed over pain
[1:21:50] he was triumph over every infirmity he
[1:21:53] rose victorious
[1:22:04] when it was all ended it was time for
[1:22:08] him to leave the earth
[1:22:10] and returns to the father and sets down
[1:22:13] as our sacrifice
[1:22:15] and all things are finished
[1:22:19] he had completely delivered
[1:22:22] mankind both spiritually and physically
[1:22:26] from all satanic bonded
[1:22:28] and gave us a deposit on each one
[1:22:31] even the holy ghost you have is not
[1:22:34] redemption in fullness
[1:22:35] it's a deposit on your inheritance
[1:22:39] and i'll tell you if the deposit is this
[1:22:41] good just think what heaven's going to
[1:22:43] be
[1:22:46] but he didn't just give you a deposit
[1:22:49] within your soul
[1:22:50] he gave you divine healing as a deposit
[1:22:53] on your resurrection
[1:22:55] that just as sure as your body
[1:22:58] is healed you will also raise from
[1:23:01] the grave
[1:23:06] this is what paul is trying to teach us
[1:23:08] in first corinthians
[1:23:10] that we've read about in the 11th
[1:23:12] chapter about the elements
[1:23:14] of this communion of the lord's supper
[1:23:19] two elements by which we're to remember
[1:23:23] the sufferings of christ he said
[1:23:24] remember this
[1:23:26] i want you to remember what you remember
[1:23:29] when you passed by i paid for your sins
[1:23:32] i want you to remember when you take
[1:23:34] this bread i healed your diseases
[1:23:40] i want you to remember i gave my body
[1:23:43] for your healing that when you take this
[1:23:48] bread you are to remember
[1:23:51] i took your punishment
[1:24:01] paul tells us when you eat this bread
[1:24:04] and drink this cup you
[1:24:05] show the lord's death till he comes
[1:24:09] he interprets these two these two
[1:24:12] emblems
[1:24:13] the cup of blessings this is in first
[1:24:15] corinthians 10
[1:24:16] 16 he speaks of the cup of blessings
[1:24:19] which we bless
[1:24:20] is it not the communion of the blood of
[1:24:21] christ and the bread we break
[1:24:24] is it not the communion of the body of
[1:24:26] christ
[1:24:29] so jesus blood was shed when he bore our
[1:24:33] sins
[1:24:34] so that we would not have to bear them
[1:24:38] but we could be saved from them and
[1:24:40] delivered from the power of sin aren't
[1:24:41] you glad for that tonight
[1:24:43] what a wonderful savior what a wonderful
[1:24:45] redeemer
[1:24:46] how we glorify god in that but jesus
[1:24:50] body was also stripped
[1:24:52] and striped when he bore our sicknesses
[1:24:55] so we would not have to bear them
[1:24:59] but could be healed delivered set free
[1:25:04] from the power of sickness
[1:25:10] we have divine healing
[1:25:14] deliverance from the power of sickness
[1:25:17] because jesus
[1:25:20] took your stripes
[1:25:27] that's why we've got to understand when
[1:25:30] we come by this communion table tonight
[1:25:33] we've got to discern the lord's body
[1:25:38] we've got to look at this bread which he
[1:25:39] said is my body
[1:25:41] and realize what it represents when
[1:25:42] we're taking it
[1:25:45] we're taking the emblem
[1:25:49] by his stripes
[1:25:52] by his broken body
[1:25:56] he bore my infirmities
[1:25:59] so i could walk away from this communion
[1:26:02] table
[1:26:06] healed
[1:26:14] this is the gospel
[1:26:18] this is what brother branham preached
[1:26:20] about the communion
[1:26:22] this is why i said there's healing in
[1:26:23] the communion
[1:26:26] amen then then we are free from sickness
[1:26:30] just like we're free from sin
[1:26:33] amen i believe tonight you can walk
[1:26:35] through here receive the communion and
[1:26:37] be just as free from sickness as you are
[1:26:39] sin
[1:26:41] amen but close because sickness is not
[1:26:44] for god's glory
[1:26:46] amen no more for god's glory than sin is
[1:26:48] for god's glory
[1:26:50] amen we you know that sin and sickness
[1:26:52] was both done away with
[1:26:54] when jesus blew it all the bible said he
[1:26:57] and and the psalmist said
[1:26:59] he paid it all every bit
[1:27:03] when he was pierced scourged
[1:27:06] beaten on our behalf
[1:27:14] this is a different kind of prayer line
[1:27:15] tonight
[1:27:17] i'm not going to lay hands on you
[1:27:20] you're going to take the bread and
[1:27:22] you're going to hold it up
[1:27:24] and you say you're going to hold it up
[1:27:27] and you're going to say
[1:27:28] you were wounded for my transgressions
[1:27:32] this is why i have the blood bruised for
[1:27:35] my iniquities
[1:27:37] this is why i have the blood but by
[1:27:39] these stripes on this body
[1:27:43] i'm healed satan has
[1:27:47] no more claim because i have a deposit
[1:27:51] of eternal life
[1:27:53] because jesus paid it all
[1:28:04] we understand about the blood
[1:28:07] but are we understanding about the bread
[1:28:11] do we eat it as a token of that passover
[1:28:14] lamb
[1:28:18] just like the israelites takes of the
[1:28:20] body of the lamb before
[1:28:22] before the journey we we
[1:28:26] we're here today we're to give sacrifice
[1:28:30] our thanks rather for the sacrifice that
[1:28:32] jesus paid on our behalf
[1:28:36] brother var is his body that was offered
[1:28:40] us
[1:28:40] but friends let's just don't take it
[1:28:42] there they just don't take it for the
[1:28:44] sin
[1:28:45] part you know most of us
[1:28:48] we well know that jesus was pierced for
[1:28:51] us
[1:28:53] that he died in our place that he paid
[1:28:56] for our sins
[1:28:57] that he was paid and full by the blood
[1:28:59] of the lamb
[1:29:01] we're sure of that but we don't realize
[1:29:04] the benefits
[1:29:06] that we could receive because his body
[1:29:09] was beaten
[1:29:11] for us and why the stripes was laid on
[1:29:16] him
[1:29:18] who heals all diseases
[1:29:22] and because that we're not discerning
[1:29:24] the lord's body
[1:29:27] that our healing is just as paid for as
[1:29:29] our sins
[1:29:31] many are sick and weakly
[1:29:34] among us
[1:29:40] tonight when you come through this
[1:29:41] communion service
[1:29:44] i want you to discern the bread
[1:29:50] you understand the wine oh the wine
[1:29:54] the wine represents his
[1:29:57] life oh the fruit of the vine
[1:30:01] the grapes of the vine squeezed out and
[1:30:05] the light squeezed out
[1:30:08] so that you could drink it
[1:30:12] it's called the blood of the grapes
[1:30:16] that's the wine but
[1:30:20] now when we understand that we
[1:30:22] understand that was for our sins
[1:30:24] it is a type of the holy ghost
[1:30:27] it is wine it's alive
[1:30:30] it is it's it's fermented it has a life
[1:30:34] in it and man it it it bubbles up
[1:30:38] it is there it has a power in it
[1:30:42] why brother when i was a when i was a
[1:30:45] kid
[1:30:46] my mother was making the wine for the
[1:30:47] communion you
[1:30:49] you take the the the wine as it would
[1:30:51] ferment
[1:30:53] and screw the lid down on it too tight
[1:30:55] in a few days it explodes
[1:30:57] and it's there all over the city's
[1:30:59] ceiling
[1:31:01] because there's power in that wine
[1:31:06] it has to have room to expand
[1:31:09] to give out and when you receive the
[1:31:12] holy ghost
[1:31:13] there's power in that blood
[1:31:16] and it's a a la it's something that
[1:31:19] stimulates it's something that
[1:31:20] invigorates us or something
[1:31:22] that empowers it changes your thinking
[1:31:26] it changes your attitude it's a relaxing
[1:31:28] time
[1:31:31] that's the wine but what about the bread
[1:31:39] too often we have forgotten or failed
[1:31:42] have been told
[1:31:44] about the benefits that we received
[1:31:46] because his body was beaten for us
[1:31:52] each part of this communion tonight i've
[1:31:54] torn apart
[1:31:57] this bread i broke it already
[1:32:02] in my home as my wife would bake the
[1:32:05] bread
[1:32:07] i took it and i separated each piece
[1:32:14] the body that was whole of that whole
[1:32:17] loaf
[1:32:18] is now many pieces
[1:32:22] it was torn pulled apart
[1:32:25] cut apart
[1:32:29] for each one of you
[1:32:33] i did it with you in mind but he did it
[1:32:36] with you in mind
[1:32:38] and this is why that he would take this
[1:32:41] and he would
[1:32:42] do it for you
[1:32:45] to be healed so you see we got
[1:32:49] the blood of christ and we're going to
[1:32:51] come down and we're going to
[1:32:52] pick up this this little cup and each
[1:32:54] one of us will have our portion
[1:32:58] they're individual cups each each cup
[1:33:02] gets individually filled
[1:33:04] each believer has their own portion
[1:33:07] each believer has their own feeling
[1:33:11] are you with me i know i know there'll
[1:33:14] be those across the internet and saying
[1:33:16] you know brother tim you're using cups
[1:33:17] and the bible said cup
[1:33:20] well so
[1:33:23] you know i've actually had people who's
[1:33:25] watched our communion service
[1:33:26] especially some of the overseas brothers
[1:33:28] who write me and said
[1:33:30] aren't you aren't you ridiculous kind of
[1:33:32] denomination you know
[1:33:33] drinking out of them multi-cups i said
[1:33:36] well
[1:33:36] that's what brother branham did but you
[1:33:39] don't know that so
[1:33:40] i'll just show you two in in the quotes
[1:33:43] but nevertheless i said
[1:33:45] you know it's strange we get all
[1:33:49] all nervous about a cup
[1:33:53] and then when it comes to foot washing
[1:33:54] the bible said he took a pan
[1:33:57] and a towel and poured water
[1:34:02] and he washed all of them's feet in the
[1:34:05] same water
[1:34:06] using the same towel in one pan
[1:34:09] so i guess if we must have one cup
[1:34:13] we'll only have one pan tonight
[1:34:16] and one towel to wash everybody's feet
[1:34:20] in
[1:34:22] no takers
[1:34:28] that's the way i feel about the cup
[1:34:34] now so you see again you know we will
[1:34:37] everyone take our portion and we will
[1:34:40] look into that
[1:34:41] and we will think of the blood the blood
[1:34:42] the blood the blood
[1:34:44] and it's cleansed me from all sins and
[1:34:46] my sins are gone
[1:34:48] but i want you to lift up that body that
[1:34:51] bread
[1:34:52] and i want you to look at it and say he
[1:34:56] gave this body
[1:34:58] so i could be healed
[1:35:02] he took my weapons and bore my pains
[1:35:05] that i can walk past this communion line
[1:35:08] and be healed of all
[1:35:11] of my sickness
[1:35:15] are you ready for your healing tonight
[1:35:20] are you ready to say in this
[1:35:23] cup it represents forgiveness of sin
[1:35:28] and in this bread represents
[1:35:32] the healing for my body
[1:35:36] and i'm going to step from this table
[1:35:38] tonight
[1:35:40] healed
[1:35:43] because if they could take
[1:35:46] natural lamb i'm bringing it home to you
[1:35:51] if they could take natural lamb and eat
[1:35:54] natural lamb and for 40 years
[1:35:57] not a sequin among them then i can take
[1:36:01] this bread
[1:36:05] natural bread that we bless tonight
[1:36:09] i can take that and know it just as
[1:36:13] it will go out and into my bloodstream
[1:36:16] and it will equip
[1:36:17] all kinds of little antibodies down in
[1:36:19] my body to go out and do its work all
[1:36:22] through my body
[1:36:23] and nurture cells and build them up i
[1:36:26] know brother
[1:36:27] when it represents the body of my lord
[1:36:29] jesus
[1:36:30] amen every bit of it's going to go to
[1:36:32] its place
[1:36:34] and i'm going to be healed
[1:36:46] in this way i discern
[1:36:50] the lord's body
[1:36:59] we've read this communion scriptures
[1:37:01] tonight

[1:37:05] the musicians just to come for just a
[1:37:07] few moments
[1:37:10] i want us to sing that song again he was
[1:37:12] wounded for my transgressions
[1:37:15] it means so much to me isaiah 53 is
[1:37:20] one of the most sublime scriptures in
[1:37:22] the entire bible
[1:37:31] he was wounded
[1:37:34] for my transgressions
[1:37:41] he was bruised for my iniquities
[1:37:49] the chastisement of my peace was on him
[1:37:56] in other words he took the weapons
[1:38:00] the punishment that i should have got
[1:38:02] [Music]
[1:38:05] and with the stripes
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:11] we are healed can we believe as brother
[1:38:17] branham did that there's healing and
[1:38:18] communion
[1:38:21] can we believe as our message taught us
[1:38:27] that we can come right through this
[1:38:28] communion line tonight
[1:38:31] and as we take of the sacraments
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:35] be healed it's his promise
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:40] are you ready to walk in that healing
[1:38:42] tonight
[1:38:44] he said brother tim what if i come
[1:38:45] through and i don't feel a thing it has
[1:38:47] nothing to do with how you feel
[1:38:48] [Music]
[1:38:50] it has to do with what god said
[1:38:54] the mountain was moving and only one
[1:38:56] grain of sand is moving it's moving
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:38:59] and it's going to move because we
[1:39:02] believe his word
[1:39:05] now what we're going to do for those
[1:39:08] that are
[1:39:09] guests here we we don't have a close
[1:39:12] communion if you're believing christ and
