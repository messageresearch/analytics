[58:09] [Music]
[58:12] amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter 4.
[58:15] verse 12. amen
[58:22] kind of like David this morning I was
[58:25] glad when they said unto me let us go
[58:26] into the house of the Lord I enjoy being
[58:29] in his presence and with his people amen
[58:33] if you're a visitor here with us today I
[58:35] pray you're blessed and feel welcomed as
[58:38] well
[58:39] amen Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12. it
[58:42] says before the word of God is quick and
[58:45] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[58:48] sword
[58:49] Pearson even to the dividing asunder of
[58:52] Soul and Spirit of joints and Morrow
[58:56] and is a deserter of the thoughts and
[58:59] intents of the heart
[59:00] amen we'll let you be seated
[59:06] hey
[59:08] actually been up a little bit down in my
[59:10] body this week and feeling much better
[59:12] today but I wasn't able to be here
[59:14] Friday night brother here and speaking
[59:16] on the church age studies and but I got
[59:19] to streaming and I have to say I was I
[59:21] was blessed amen and amen if you missed
[59:25] it and it's open to anybody it's worth
[59:27] coming to it's the word of God
[59:30] amen his word is uh there to touch us in
[59:34] our lives and we saw the Spirit of the
[59:36] Lord move in a Bible study and and
[59:39] touched many hearts and many lives and
[59:41] you know I think we never should come to
[59:43] the point or the place to where we think
[59:44] we know it all
[59:46] but every day we ought to be looking for
[59:48] more of him I I believe God can use one
[59:51] verse for for a long time and open it up
[59:54] over and over and over to our hearts and
[59:56] our lives and and and and and I know as
[59:59] human sometimes we kind of get uh puffed
[1:00:02] up in our our our degrees of the of the
[1:00:05] message or the Bible but I believe we
[1:00:08] ought to always be looking for more of
[1:00:10] God and more of God in our hearts and
[1:00:13] and this morning I'd like to take again
[1:00:15] out of this scripture but I'd like to
[1:00:17] speak on the light the two-mouth sword
[1:00:21] two mouth sword actually if you look at
[1:00:24] the two-edged sword there as it would as
[1:00:26] you would look into the the word it
[1:00:28] actually means uh I can't pronounce the
[1:00:31] Greek word but it means having two
[1:00:33] mouths therefore has two edges we could
[1:00:37] also look but we know where the word of
[1:00:39] God Is Spoken amen is not you know the
[1:00:42] sword that we have today is as I get
[1:00:44] into this and this thought and we're
[1:00:46] going to speak about the hand that holds
[1:00:48] the sword but I want you to when you
[1:00:50] think of that it's not a certain sword
[1:00:53] or a physical sword that we're handling
[1:00:55] this morning but a spiritual sword and
[1:00:58] so is not that we as as Israel or others
[1:01:01] of the Bible would take a physical sword
[1:01:03] invite a physical enemy amen we have a
[1:01:05] spiritual sword but it'll fight our
[1:01:08] spiritual enemy that we face in this
[1:01:10] time and this life that we're living in
[1:01:12] and so when we speak about the hand that
[1:01:15] holds a sword the sword in our day is
[1:01:17] actually held in our mouth and so it's
[1:01:21] the mouth mouth that speaks and and we
[1:01:23] can read about it in Revelations 1 and
[1:01:25] verse 16. he said he had the right hands
[1:01:28] seven seven stars and out of his mouth
[1:01:30] when a sharp two-edged sword and also in
[1:01:34] Revelations 2 it talks about these
[1:01:36] things saith he that hath the sharp
[1:01:39] sword with two edges so it's a sharp
[1:01:42] two-edged sword or a two-mouth each each
[1:01:45] Edge representing a mouth the sword was
[1:01:48] not held in the hand but is held in the
[1:01:51] mouth it is the word of God words that
[1:01:53] are spoken that have great effect upon
[1:01:56] on our enemy a word that has power and
[1:02:00] is able to defeat the Devil and every
[1:02:03] one of his attempts to stand up or block
[1:02:06] the promises of God now the sword of God
[1:02:09] it cuts both coming and going up and
[1:02:12] down and in and out in other words in
[1:02:15] any situation in your life if you'll use
[1:02:18] the word of God it will do great a great
[1:02:21] harm upon your enemy it will cause him
[1:02:24] great a conflict or great hurt the word
[1:02:27] will cut when it's used it's sharp it's
[1:02:30] able to cut any disease it's able to cut
[1:02:33] out any Spirit of hell it's able to come
[1:02:35] against the powers of Satan and defeat
[1:02:38] them by the spoken word of God the Bible
[1:02:41] must be put in action by your lips
[1:02:44] speaking amen the word of God you know
[1:02:46] was spoken before it was written but now
[1:02:49] it's written in order for it to be
[1:02:51] spoken
[1:02:52] amen so it's not good enough to just
[1:02:55] have a Bible as you would lay it on your
[1:02:57] coffee table or on your on your book by
[1:02:59] yourself beside your bed and it's a
[1:03:01] beautiful Bible and point and look at it
[1:03:04] and even read it but you must take what
[1:03:06] you read and allow it to come into your
[1:03:08] heart and by inspiration begin to speak
[1:03:11] the word of God and when you do it puts
[1:03:14] something into action it's not enough
[1:03:16] that God has spoken the word of God and
[1:03:19] God has anointed men to write it upon
[1:03:21] paper but it must be spoken from your
[1:03:24] lips in in order for it to become
[1:03:27] powerful to your situation amen you know
[1:03:30] Isaiah 49 and verse 2 said he hath made
[1:03:33] my mouth like a sharp sword amen so it's
[1:03:37] not just God's mouth is a sharp sword
[1:03:40] but your mouth has he made a sharp sword
[1:03:42] now brother Joe talked about it as he
[1:03:44] began to take the prayer request that
[1:03:46] life and death is in the power of the
[1:03:48] tongue so it has a sharpness to it that
[1:03:51] can bring life or it can bring death it
[1:03:54] can bring life to the situation that
[1:03:56] you're in and death to your enemies or
[1:03:58] you can use it in such a way that it'll
[1:04:00] bring death to your children or death
[1:04:02] amen to that your brother around you but
[1:04:04] we want to use it and the way God has
[1:04:07] orchestrated it for it to be used amen
[1:04:09] the word of God is never something that
[1:04:11] we should take and use against our
[1:04:13] brother but it's something that you
[1:04:15] should take into your mouth and begin to
[1:04:17] speak against the enemy that's in your
[1:04:19] life amen and so this word amen is with
[1:04:23] us and we can read about it in Romans 10
[1:04:25] and verse 5. he says for Moses
[1:04:27] describeth the righteousness whatso the
[1:04:30] law that men which doeth these things
[1:04:32] shall live by them but the righteousness
[1:04:34] which is of faith speaketh
[1:04:37] come on now and readeth it speaketh on
[1:04:41] this wise saying not in thy heart who
[1:04:44] shall I send from Heaven that is to
[1:04:46] bring Christ down from above or who
[1:04:48] shall descend from the deep that is to
[1:04:50] bring up Christ again from the dead but
[1:04:52] what saith it
[1:04:55] what saith that the word is neither even
[1:04:59] in thy mouth
[1:05:02] amen even in thy mouth and in the heart
[1:05:05] that is the word of faith which we
[1:05:08] preach or speak amen it's the word of
[1:05:11] faith that we preach amen it's not a
[1:05:13] word of faith that we read and say it's
[1:05:15] a good word or agree with it but it's
[1:05:18] something that comes on the inside of us
[1:05:19] and begins to begins to anoint a part of
[1:05:22] our life and out of our mouth we begin
[1:05:25] to speak the word of God and when we
[1:05:27] speak it it goes and it cuts out Spirits
[1:05:30] it cuts out demons it cuts out sickness
[1:05:32] it cuts out diseases of every kind and
[1:05:35] if Thou shalt confess or speak without
[1:05:38] mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe
[1:05:41] in the heart that God has raised him
[1:05:43] from the dead Thou shalt be saved
[1:05:47] so to be saved you have to speak
[1:05:51] amen not agree not just say well that's
[1:05:54] okay and Nod your head but no speak the
[1:05:57] word of God
[1:05:58] that's why it's important when we come
[1:05:59] to the house of God and the word is
[1:06:01] spoken that we also amen speak back
[1:06:06] amen when you're not just a bunch of
[1:06:07] church knotters and saying yeah that's
[1:06:09] right but know something is coming out
[1:06:12] of our hearts and it's speaking back to
[1:06:14] the word
[1:06:15] [Applause]
[1:06:16] foreign
[1:06:22] God is near it means he's right there
[1:06:25] ready to help you he's near you or close
[1:06:29] to hand meaning he's ready to help you
[1:06:32] at any moment
[1:06:34] but it takes you speaking the word he's
[1:06:36] ever present but you've got to speak the
[1:06:39] word
[1:06:39] amen he's ever able to help but you've
[1:06:42] got to speak the word his word is always
[1:06:44] near it's already always ready to fight
[1:06:46] it's always ready to be taken off of
[1:06:49] paper and put into action how by
[1:06:52] speaking
[1:06:54] amen the word in Ephesians 6 and verse
[1:06:57] 17 The Sword and take the Hellman of
[1:07:00] Salvation the sword of the spirit which
[1:07:03] is the word of God we all want to read
[1:07:05] it in a different translation it says
[1:07:07] embrace the power of Satan's our
[1:07:09] salvations full Deliverance like a
[1:07:12] helmet to protect your thoughts from
[1:07:14] lies and take the mighty razor-sharp
[1:07:18] sword of the spoken word of God
[1:07:22] amen the spoken word of God Amen listen
[1:07:25] it wasn't just enough for God to think
[1:07:28] let there be light there had to be an
[1:07:31] utterance that went out of his mouth and
[1:07:33] said let there be light it's a spoken
[1:07:36] word or a declaration
[1:07:39] it's declaring amen this is why Paul
[1:07:41] said we have the same Faith according as
[1:07:44] it is written I believe therefore I have
[1:07:47] spoken we have believed therefore we
[1:07:49] speak
[1:07:54] the word of God is like a sword that has
[1:07:57] two edges it's cutting both ways
[1:08:00] and is doing terrible damage to the
[1:08:02] enemy amen as we read this for the
[1:08:05] Ephesians calls it the sword of the
[1:08:07] spirit which is the spoken word of God
[1:08:10] this word means this word of God is
[1:08:12] actually from the Greek word Rima which
[1:08:15] means or it's something that's spoken
[1:08:17] clearly or vividly or an unmistakable
[1:08:21] terms and undeniable language
[1:08:24] so it's not something that you just
[1:08:27] mutter to the devil
[1:08:28] but he knows what you're speaking he can
[1:08:31] clearly hear what you're saying amen
[1:08:34] it's undeniable language that is spoken
[1:08:37] that goes out of your mouth it is a
[1:08:39] spoken word you know here's an example
[1:08:41] of rimma or a spoken word you're praying
[1:08:44] about a situation and and suddenly a
[1:08:47] Bible verse Rises up inside your heart
[1:08:49] and at that moment you're consciously
[1:08:51] aware that God has given you something
[1:08:54] to stand on and clang for your situation
[1:08:57] and therefore you receive the word that
[1:09:00] come out of the mouth of God it's
[1:09:01] dropped in your spirit but it can't stay
[1:09:04] there
[1:09:05] it has to be spoken the word of God was
[1:09:09] so sharp that it'll cut right down to
[1:09:11] your questions through your intellectual
[1:09:13] abilities through your natural logic and
[1:09:16] enlarge deepened within your heart and
[1:09:18] all of a sudden amen it begins to
[1:09:20] germinate there and it begins to rise up
[1:09:23] out of you and you begin to speak it and
[1:09:26] release the power that's on the inside
[1:09:29] of you
[1:09:31] Hallelujah you received a word that come
[1:09:34] right out of the mouth of God drop right
[1:09:37] into your heart and God now is speaking
[1:09:39] it through you
[1:09:42] well he has no lips on Earth but our
[1:09:44] lips right
[1:09:45] amen so it takes us amen as a vessel and
[1:09:50] so the word come out of the mouth of God
[1:09:52] next it has to come out of your mouth
[1:09:56] and when it comes out of your mouth it
[1:09:58] becomes a sharp two-edged or literally
[1:10:00] two-mouth sword
[1:10:04] one edge of the sword came into
[1:10:06] existence when the word of God come out
[1:10:08] of his mouth and the second age comes
[1:10:11] into existence when it comes out of your
[1:10:13] mouth
[1:10:14] and it'll cut coming and going it'll cut
[1:10:16] coming up and down or backwards and
[1:10:18] forward it doesn't matter when it comes
[1:10:21] out of your mouth it's going to inflict
[1:10:23] harm on your enemy that's why the enemy
[1:10:26] is trying so hard amen he don't care if
[1:10:28] you believe it he just don't want you to
[1:10:30] believe it enough to speak it
[1:10:32] and then when you speak it amen light
[1:10:35] comes out of your mouth and it goes
[1:10:37] against the darkness that's trying to
[1:10:39] stand up against you and it begins to
[1:10:41] fight against it and it begins to push
[1:10:43] it back that's why it's important when
[1:10:45] we come to the house of God we speak the
[1:10:47] name of Jesus it ain't just enough to
[1:10:50] believe the name of Jesus you got to
[1:10:52] speak the name of Jesus because in the
[1:10:54] speaking of that name there's power over
[1:10:57] every devil
[1:10:59] there's power over everything that would
[1:11:01] hold you when you speak the name of
[1:11:03] Jesus
[1:11:08] something begins to happen
[1:11:10] when you finally rise up and you speak
[1:11:13] the word of God
[1:11:15] the moment it comes out of your mouth
[1:11:18] the second Edge comes to the blade
[1:11:21] nothing is more powerful in the word
[1:11:23] that first comes from God's mouth and
[1:11:26] then your mouth
[1:11:29] amen amen nothing is more powerful than
[1:11:32] a word that comes from God's mouth and
[1:11:35] then out of your mouth you and God have
[1:11:37] come into agreement
[1:11:40] you're on the same blade
[1:11:43] amen an agreement releases Mighty power
[1:11:46] to your situation this is why he was
[1:11:48] saying to patman's Vision don't fear
[1:11:51] John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I
[1:11:53] am your heir to all my power is yours my
[1:11:57] omnipotence is yours as I stand in your
[1:11:59] midst I've not come to bring fear and
[1:12:01] failure but love courage and ability all
[1:12:05] power is given to me and it's yours to
[1:12:08] use
[1:12:10] how am I going to use this power you
[1:12:13] speak the word and I'll perform it
[1:12:18] I can't tell you how many times
[1:12:21] in prayer lines you know you want to get
[1:12:24] people to confess things and I'm not
[1:12:26] even necessarily talking about Sin but
[1:12:28] that's that's an important thing that is
[1:12:30] important thing to do is to confess and
[1:12:32] make those things right but to confess
[1:12:34] amen first they're a child of God
[1:12:37] just a few days a few months ago I was
[1:12:39] in a prayer line and you know and I
[1:12:41] understood later that the sister came
[1:12:43] from a church said they were taught that
[1:12:45] sisters to remain quiet and not say
[1:12:47] anything because it's what Paul said and
[1:12:50] so they were even in church they made it
[1:12:51] down to the point that we're in church
[1:12:53] they can't even say Amen they can't be
[1:12:55] vocal they can't say nothing what is
[1:12:57] that that is the devil trying to clamp
[1:13:00] down their freedom
[1:13:02] and trying to make it to where they came
[1:13:05] experience the release of the power of
[1:13:08] God in their life
[1:13:11] and so in this prayer line I didn't know
[1:13:13] who she was didn't have no idea of the
[1:13:16] situation and I said sister and she come
[1:13:18] up asking for prayer on a sister a
[1:13:20] certain situation I said see I can pray
[1:13:22] the prayer but unless you confess that
[1:13:25] God's going to do this for you it's not
[1:13:27] going to do you no good because I could
[1:13:28] see there was a hindrance there and she
[1:13:30] went to speak it and it couldn't come
[1:13:32] out of her mouth I said you've got to
[1:13:34] speak it and she would try and it
[1:13:35] wouldn't come out of her mouth and
[1:13:37] finance your hand went up and I said
[1:13:38] don't put your hand over your mouth
[1:13:40] you've got to release the power of God
[1:13:43] for your situation
[1:13:46] amen that's why there's power in
[1:13:49] confessing the word of God
[1:13:52] it's not just believing it
[1:13:55] but confessing it
[1:13:57] speaking it letting it come out of your
[1:14:00] mouth amen for your situation
[1:14:04] but you never could and she went out
[1:14:06] just as bound as she ever was
[1:14:11] so this is where I want to bring it to
[1:14:12] us is why the devil tries to clamp down
[1:14:15] on our amounts
[1:14:17] he tries to clamp down you heard it last
[1:14:19] Wednesday night our response he tries to
[1:14:22] clamp down on that because he knows
[1:14:24] there's power in that response
[1:14:28] for you
[1:14:30] amen what if Hattie right would have
[1:14:32] never responded
[1:14:35] and she just nodded and said yeah okay
[1:14:37] yeah no there was something that come
[1:14:39] out of her that's nothing but the truth
[1:14:44] and brother Robert said standing in that
[1:14:46] powerful anointing
[1:14:49] what anointing the word that came out of
[1:14:51] a little woman's mouth
[1:14:56] God gave her her two sons
[1:15:01] Jesus would try to teach us this in
[1:15:03] March or Mark 11 chapter 20.
[1:15:06] in the morning as they passed they saw
[1:15:08] the fig tree
[1:15:09] dried up from the roots
[1:15:11] and Peter calling to remembrance unto
[1:15:13] him Master behold the Fig Tree which
[1:15:16] thou curses is withered away and Jesus
[1:15:19] answered said unto him have faith in God
[1:15:21] for verily I say unto you that
[1:15:23] whatsoever shall say whosoever shall say
[1:15:25] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[1:15:28] be cast into the sea and shall not doubt
[1:15:30] in his heart but shall believe that
[1:15:32] those things which he said shall come to
[1:15:34] pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:15:38] thinketh
[1:15:40] I thought a little curveball
[1:15:42] whatever he readth
[1:15:46] whatever he nods to no whatever he saith
[1:15:51] [Applause]
[1:15:52] he saith therefore I say unto you
[1:15:55] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:15:57] pray believe that you receive them and
[1:16:00] ye shall have them
[1:16:03] it is the words that spoke that moves
[1:16:06] mountains
[1:16:08] it's not good enough just to believe it
[1:16:10] you have to speak the word of God and
[1:16:13] that moves the mountain in your way
[1:16:14] listen your Mountain knows your voice
[1:16:20] and he didn't say go get a preacher and
[1:16:22] have him speak to it or just the
[1:16:24] disciples could speak so do it what I
[1:16:26] read said whosoever
[1:16:31] do we have any whosoevers in him in here
[1:16:34] this morning
[1:16:35] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:16:38] be thou removed
[1:16:41] now he didn't say I was going to remove
[1:16:43] in one moment
[1:16:44] it does sometimes it's a miracle but
[1:16:47] many times it's healings and and it
[1:16:49] looks like there's just a maybe not you
[1:16:51] can't even hard to see a trickle of sand
[1:16:53] he said but if you'll stay right there
[1:16:55] and what you have spoken God will
[1:16:58] perform what was said
[1:17:04] it's the word that spoke it's it has to
[1:17:08] be an utterance
[1:17:10] it's speaking the word that gives it the
[1:17:12] sharp edge to cut through and remove
[1:17:15] mountains of fear and mountains of
[1:17:18] unbelief
[1:17:19] mountains of sin and things has held you
[1:17:22] amen it takes a spoken word
[1:17:29] what is a word a word is the
[1:17:31] manifestation of a thought
[1:17:34] it is the expression of a thought
[1:17:37] is that right before you say anything
[1:17:39] you subconsciously you think it before
[1:17:42] you speak it
[1:17:44] now some people's a little faster at
[1:17:45] that
[1:17:47] it's what you call having no filter
[1:17:50] yeah it's just something comes but they
[1:17:52] had to still think it
[1:17:55] they just didn't allow that thought to
[1:17:57] sit there just a nanosecond before they
[1:17:59] said it
[1:18:01] amen but listen brother random talks
[1:18:03] about he said you have to see that your
[1:18:05] motive and your objective is right
[1:18:08] and he said when that is right and you
[1:18:10] see that you're standing there looking
[1:18:12] at a mountain and this mountain has no
[1:18:14] right to be there
[1:18:17] come on now that mountain has no right
[1:18:20] to be there in your life
[1:18:22] it has no right to stay there over your
[1:18:24] children over your situation but listen
[1:18:27] you can allow it to stay there as long
[1:18:29] as you look at and say well I believe
[1:18:30] it's a mountain I believe God said I
[1:18:32] could say something but it never comes
[1:18:34] out of your mouth
[1:18:38] in the beginning was the word
[1:18:41] and as far as we could go back
[1:18:43] but before the word was it was a thought
[1:18:48] and a thought was made manifest
[1:18:51] he thought and then he spoke and then it
[1:18:54] become the spoken word
[1:18:57] amen the word was made manifested Jesus
[1:19:01] no wonder when he came off the hill that
[1:19:03] night and he looked around the tree for
[1:19:05] food and fig tree and there was no food
[1:19:07] he said no man eateth from thee and he
[1:19:09] went on his way and the next time they
[1:19:11] come back the tree was withered
[1:19:13] the mind in the beginning was a thought
[1:19:15] before it was a word and it expressed
[1:19:18] Jesus Christ the same one was expressing
[1:19:21] that word again
[1:19:23] it was a creative word of God
[1:19:29] it had power over nature
[1:19:32] it had power over every circumstance he
[1:19:35] had power over every situation every
[1:19:38] word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid
[1:19:41] in seed form
[1:19:46] and if received into a human being
[1:19:49] and spoke by the same thought that
[1:19:52] materialized in the Bible it'll bring it
[1:19:55] to pass how powerful could the church be
[1:19:59] the Bible said let this mind that was in
[1:20:02] Christ be in you as a man think in his
[1:20:05] heart so is he
[1:20:07] and God said let there be a world before
[1:20:10] there was a word it had to be a thought
[1:20:12] and God in creation created the word by
[1:20:15] thought first and then he spoke it and
[1:20:17] if that same spirit
[1:20:20] that said let there be light and there
[1:20:22] was light Let There Be trees and there
[1:20:24] was trees if that same one
[1:20:27] it's in you and in your mind not your
[1:20:30] mind but the mind of Christ
[1:20:33] how much more could it say
[1:20:37] Let Me Clear My Voice
[1:20:40] how much more could it say let them eat
[1:20:44] no cancer
[1:20:45] [Applause]
[1:20:48] glory to God I wanted the devil to hear
[1:20:51] that real clear let there be
[1:20:54] there bit sir and it would be gone
[1:21:01] let the blind eyes be open and it'll
[1:21:04] happen
[1:21:05] he said well my church don't believe
[1:21:07] that well get a different Church
[1:21:09] that believes the Bible whosoever says
[1:21:12] to this mountain
[1:21:19] he said well that was Jesus
[1:21:21] wait a minute he said have faith in God
[1:21:25] for verily verily I say unto you
[1:21:32] whosoevers
[1:21:37] if you shall say to this mountain
[1:21:42] be moved and plucked up and cast into
[1:21:44] the sea and don't doubt in your heart
[1:21:46] but believe what you say will come to
[1:21:48] pass you'll have whatever things I'll
[1:21:51] saith you shall have it what power has
[1:21:54] been given to the Church of the Living
[1:21:56] God
[1:21:58] you can ex now you can express it by
[1:22:01] mental conception but it had first
[1:22:03] because to become a real revelation of
[1:22:06] God and see and you see it before it
[1:22:09] happens
[1:22:12] do you believe it and you express it in
[1:22:14] word form and then that word takes hold
[1:22:16] and it becomes materialized a thought
[1:22:19] expressed what kind of people should we
[1:22:21] be
[1:22:23] foreign
[1:22:25] holy spirit that has used so in body has
[1:22:29] empowered you that you don't use your
[1:22:32] own thoughts
[1:22:34] and you don't use your own mind
[1:22:37] you don't use your own opinion oh
[1:22:40] but the holy spirit is used so build
[1:22:42] into your thoughts and you be in God's
[1:22:45] spirit expressing itself through you
[1:22:47] what kind of church should we be what
[1:22:49] kind of people would would even like
[1:22:51] Tabernacle be this morning so filled
[1:22:53] with the presence of God until you don't
[1:22:56] even use your own mind you don't even
[1:22:58] use your own thoughts
[1:23:00] but you're led by the spirit of God
[1:23:03] I believe there ought to be people like
[1:23:05] that
[1:23:06] led by the spirit of God and they that
[1:23:08] are sons of God are led by the spirit of
[1:23:11] God and then when the human element goes
[1:23:13] out and the spirit of God takes these
[1:23:15] vacancy where you emptied yourself out
[1:23:18] he will fill it
[1:23:21] then your thoughts will become words and
[1:23:23] your words will become materialized
[1:23:25] that's when the church is in his power I
[1:23:28] believe it's on the road right now
[1:23:33] that when the church will be so wrapped
[1:23:35] in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so
[1:23:38] away from themselves that they don't see
[1:23:40] themselves they don't have they don't
[1:23:42] have no thoughts of their own their
[1:23:44] thoughts are moved out and they refuse
[1:23:46] the things of the world they move in the
[1:23:48] spirit that live in the spirit they walk
[1:23:51] in the spirit
[1:23:52] moving under the unction of the Holy
[1:23:54] Ghost
[1:23:59] see your words can change your
[1:24:02] atmosphere
[1:24:04] it can actually change the atmosphere
[1:24:06] around you your words
[1:24:09] your words can produce an atmosphere of
[1:24:11] unbelief or it can produce an atmosphere
[1:24:14] of faith
[1:24:16] your words can produce an atmosphere of
[1:24:18] sadness or it can produce an atmosphere
[1:24:21] of happy and glad your words produce

[1:24:37] been looking at and wondering about for
[1:24:39] 20 years
[1:24:41] God can come and do that in just a
[1:24:43] moment by the words that comes out of
[1:24:45] your mouth
[1:24:46] it can produce such an atmosphere around
[1:24:49] you amen why is preaching so powerful
[1:24:51] because it's words being released
[1:24:55] not just the words of a mortal man but
[1:24:57] the words of almighty God through the
[1:24:59] foolishness of preaching is an
[1:25:01] expression of God's thoughts be released

[1:26:51] what you need to do is start looking at
[1:26:53] that mountain that looks so tall and so
[1:26:54] high and so wide and so impossible to
[1:26:56] climb so possible to get past you need
[1:26:59] to start telling that mountain do you
[1:27:01] know what mountain I serve a great big
[1:27:04] God
[1:27:06] and he ain't found one mountain yet he
[1:27:09] can't conquer
[1:27:11] he ain't found one impossibility that he
[1:27:13] can't make possible he ain't found one
[1:27:16] situation he can't handle he hasn't
[1:27:18] found one sickness that he can't heal he
[1:27:21] hasn't found one sin that he can cure
[1:27:28] tell the mountain how big your God is
[1:27:33] start using the word
[1:27:35] let me ask you this morning is the
[1:27:37] mountain bigger or your God bigger
[1:27:40] depends on who your God is
[1:27:43] amen but if it's the god that said let
[1:27:47] there be there ain't a mountain too big
[1:27:49] [Applause]
[1:27:52] when you said Mountain be moved and it
[1:27:54] still stands there you say well it
[1:27:56] didn't happen oh it did happen
[1:27:59] it did happen when you said mountain
[1:28:01] move maybe one little insignificant
[1:28:04] looking grain of sand turned over and
[1:28:06] started to roll down the hill out of the
[1:28:08] hundreds of billions and billions of
[1:28:10] tons of sand one little grain moved but
[1:28:13] it's begin to take place
[1:28:18] hallelujah it's began to take place you
[1:28:21] hold that Faith until you see that
[1:28:24] mountain disappear
[1:28:27] Thou shalt say in thy heart disease move
[1:28:30] from my child disease move from my body
[1:28:33] in the name of Jesus Christ and don't
[1:28:36] doubt
[1:28:37] [Applause]
[1:28:39] and right from the good germs right
[1:28:42] there the good germs will take on new
[1:28:44] armor oh my
[1:28:46] them good cells in your body they'll get
[1:28:49] strengthened when you begin to speak the
[1:28:50] word of God they'll take on new armor
[1:28:52] and they'll get new weapons and they'll
[1:28:54] get a new strength to fight the enemy
[1:28:56] he's defeated because Christ has taken
[1:28:59] him down to Calvary and stripped him of
[1:29:02] everything he had
[1:29:05] therefore we're not speaking a defeated
[1:29:08] word we're speaking a word that'll
[1:29:10] defeat every devil
[1:29:14] we're not speaking every right weak word
[1:29:16] we're speaking a word that's strong
[1:29:18] enough that's powerful enough that's
[1:29:21] great enough to move any mountain
[1:29:28] but it comes down to this
[1:29:32] this is quite
[1:29:33] incredible thought
[1:29:36] he says in the parking me in church age
[1:29:38] he said I wonder if we're sufficiently
[1:29:43] impressed
[1:29:44] with the word that's in our midst
[1:29:49] that kind of strikes deep don't it
[1:29:53] if we're really impressed we get
[1:29:55] impressed by a lot of things in this
[1:29:56] life
[1:29:58] get impressed by whatever this one can
[1:30:01] do whatever that was done
[1:30:02] but what are are we sufficiently
[1:30:05] impressed with the word
[1:30:09] is he a big enough God
[1:30:12] is he truly the champion of champions
[1:30:21] is he truly able to come and move in
[1:30:24] your darkest moment
[1:30:26] and change everything just in just a
[1:30:30] moment
[1:30:32] yeah yeah
[1:30:33] I'm impressed with him enough to know he
[1:30:35] can do that
[1:30:39] listen we get impressed by mountains we
[1:30:41] get impressed by a beautiful landscapes
[1:30:44] we get impressed you know you go to the
[1:30:45] Grand Canyon to get impressed you go to
[1:30:48] Great mountains of the Alps you get
[1:30:51] impressed by their beauty but who made
[1:30:54] all of that
[1:30:58] the god that called you
[1:31:01] the god that spoke your name
[1:31:04] he planted a seed over there and
[1:31:07] thousands of maybe millions of years
[1:31:09] past let there be light
[1:31:12] but he had a seed laying there at about
[1:31:15] two years 1900s or two thousands
[1:31:17] whatever it was all of a sudden that
[1:31:20] seed that was laying there for thousands
[1:31:22] of years a word began to speak out
[1:31:26] and he had enough confidence in his word
[1:31:29] just as much as he said let there be
[1:31:31] that he didn't care how bad the climate
[1:31:34] was he didn't back care how dark it was
[1:31:36] he didn't care how much drugs and
[1:31:38] alcohol and spirits of every kind he
[1:31:41] knew what his word went forth it's going
[1:31:44] to come to pass
[1:31:47] so he allowed the devil to create his
[1:31:51] own Eden he allowed him to bring all of
[1:31:53] his spirits into this realm and he said
[1:31:55] hey devil you can do all you want to do
[1:31:58] I'm still greater
[1:32:00] you can wall up the walls you can make
[1:32:03] mountains so high you can pour concrete
[1:32:05] over my sea but when my light begins to
[1:32:08] shine they're gonna come out
[1:32:10] they're going to come forth and they
[1:32:13] ain't enough Devils that can stop them
[1:32:17] did you hear the word this morning they
[1:32:20] ain't enough devils in this world that
[1:32:23] can stop a child of God from coming
[1:32:25] forth to what God called him to be
[1:32:32] foreign
[1:32:33] maybe we need to change our impressions
[1:32:38] to be six significantly or greatly
[1:32:42] impressed by the word that's in our
[1:32:44] midst
[1:32:46] listen
[1:32:47] we're not speaking the words of a mortal
[1:32:50] man
[1:32:53] there's been great men that spoke great
[1:32:55] things
[1:32:56] they've made great speeches Abraham
[1:32:59] Lincoln's Paul reverse
[1:33:02] John Paul Jones
[1:33:04] great things that we hold on today
[1:33:06] I've just begun to fight
[1:33:09] that's a great word
[1:33:11] I like using that
[1:33:16] but there those men they lived and they
[1:33:19] died
[1:33:22] and you couldn't get them here today to
[1:33:23] speak another word
[1:33:25] they're gone
[1:33:27] they live their life
[1:33:28] some of them that spoke great things
[1:33:30] were actually terrible men
[1:33:34] but I'm not speaking to you about a
[1:33:36] mortal man this morning and taking
[1:33:39] mortal man's words and speaking them I'm
[1:33:42] talking about are you significantly and
[1:33:45] sufficiently impressed
[1:33:47] with God
[1:33:49] he came as a man he died as a man but he
[1:33:52] rose again
[1:33:54] and his word is still has the power in
[1:33:57] it to do everything that he said it
[1:33:59] would do
[1:34:00] it's not a mortal man it's not a man
[1:34:02] when he dies his word has no more power
[1:34:04] anymore this God's word still has power
[1:34:08] therefore we can have confidence that
[1:34:10] this is this is the confidence we have
[1:34:13] in him that if we ask anything according
[1:34:15] to his will he heareth us and if we know
[1:34:18] that he hears us whatsoever we ask we
[1:34:21] know that we have the petition that we
[1:34:23] have desired of him so what is the will
[1:34:26] of God there's only one way to know his
[1:34:28] will and that is the word
[1:34:35] he says in lamentation is three who is
[1:34:37] he that saith and it cometh to pass when
[1:34:40] the Lord commanded the knot there it is
[1:34:42] if it isn't in the word you can't have
[1:34:44] it
[1:34:45] but you can't ask for it unless it's in
[1:34:47] the word
[1:34:48] well that's great comfort to me because
[1:34:50] healing's in the word
[1:34:52] salvation for my children is in the word
[1:34:55] amen situations overcoming depression is
[1:34:58] in the word
[1:35:01] it's all there
[1:35:04] we can't petition or ask unless it's in
[1:35:06] his name there it is again Jesus the
[1:35:08] name is the word you can't separate God
[1:35:10] in the word they're one now the word he
[1:35:13] is Left Behind on the printed pages is
[1:35:15] part of him when you accept it by faith
[1:35:17] into a Spirit-filled life he said that
[1:35:19] his word was live but what exactly is he
[1:35:22] I am the way the truth of life if any
[1:35:24] man not have the spirit of Christ is
[1:35:26] none of his there it is he is spirit and
[1:35:28] he is life that is exactly what the word
[1:35:31] is
[1:35:32] and that's exactly what Jesus is he is
[1:35:35] the word so when a spirit born
[1:35:38] Spirit-filled man in faith takes a word
[1:35:40] into his heart and places upon his lips
[1:35:43] why that's the same as deity speaking
[1:35:48] that's the same as deity speaking Every
[1:35:51] Mountain has to go
[1:35:56] Satan cannot stand before that man if
[1:36:00] the church way back there in the third
[1:36:01] age had only held on to the revelation
[1:36:03] of the Living Word in their midst the
[1:36:05] power of God was not a faded like it did
[1:36:07] in those dark ages and right today when
[1:36:10] the church returns to the word and faith
[1:36:12] we can and we can say without a doubt
[1:36:15] that the glory of God and the wonderful
[1:36:17] acts of God will be intermissed again
[1:36:23] laughs
[1:36:27] now we're I'm gonna go to a very
[1:36:29] familiar scripture
[1:36:31] Revelations 10 and verse 1.
[1:36:34] and something has been fulfilled in our
[1:36:36] day
[1:36:40] amen
[1:36:42] and I saw another Mighty angel
[1:36:45] come down from heaven clothe with the
[1:36:47] cloud
[1:36:48] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:36:50] face was as a son and his feet as Pillar
[1:36:53] of Fire a lot of light right there
[1:36:56] a lot of light and he had in his hand a
[1:36:58] little open book or book open and he set
[1:37:01] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:37:03] foot upon the Earth and he cried with a
[1:37:05] loud voice
[1:37:06] oh there had to be an utterance
[1:37:08] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[1:37:11] roars and when he had cried seven
[1:37:13] Thunders uttered their voices
[1:37:17] and we know what those seven Thunders
[1:37:19] are they're the revelations of the Seven
[1:37:21] Seals
[1:37:22] that God has given in this day and when
[1:37:25] the seven Thunders had other their
[1:37:26] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[1:37:28] a Voice a voice from Heaven saying let
[1:37:30] me seal up those sayings which the seven
[1:37:32] Thunders uttered and right them not and
[1:37:35] the angel which I Saul sat upon the sea
[1:37:37] and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[1:37:40] heaven
[1:37:41] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:37:44] ever excuse me for
[1:37:50] me who created heaven and the things
[1:37:52] that they're in and the earth and the
[1:37:54] things that are therein and the Sea and
[1:37:57] the things that are therein that there
[1:37:59] should be time no longer so this God has
[1:38:01] spoke into existence the land the sea
[1:38:04] everything that was in
[1:38:06] which sufficiently impressed with this
[1:38:08] God
[1:38:11] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:38:13] seventh angel
[1:38:15] seventh Church aides seventh angel and
[1:38:18] when Easter begin to sound the mystery
[1:38:20] of God should be finished as he declared
[1:38:22] to his servants of prophets and the
[1:38:24] voice which I heard from Heaven spake
[1:38:26] unto me again go and take the little
[1:38:28] book which is open in the hand of the
[1:38:30] Angel which standeth on the sin upon the
[1:38:32] Earth and I went into the angel said
[1:38:34] give me the little book and he said take
[1:38:36] it eat it
[1:38:40] take it eat it and it will make our
[1:38:42] belly bitter and it shall be in thy
[1:38:44] mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[1:38:46] little book out of their hand and ate it
[1:38:48] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:38:50] but in my belly it was bitter and then
[1:38:53] he said unto me
[1:38:55] thou must prophesy again
[1:39:01] so it wasn't just good enough for the
[1:39:03] seventh angel to say it
[1:39:06] to speak the words that God had uttered
[1:39:08] but that he John as a as a type of the
[1:39:12] Bride had to take the word eat the word
[1:39:16] and then speak the word
[1:39:20] there's power in speaking the word
[1:39:26] now we know
[1:39:28] what was given in this time that we're
[1:39:30] living in
[1:39:32] this message that we received is
[1:39:34] literally the king's sword
[1:39:38] it came in a prophet's hand and it came
[1:39:40] down in his hand he said he looked at it
[1:39:42] it was a glistening and Shining
[1:39:45] and he said I wonder he said I was
[1:39:46] always scared of Swords he said I'm so
[1:39:48] glad I didn't you know I'm gonna be
[1:39:49] honest with you I'm glad too I didn't
[1:39:51] live back in the days when they had
[1:39:53] swords and they fought with swords
[1:39:56] I just you know if I got to die give me
[1:39:58] a bullet
[1:40:01] let it be over with but slice me up and
[1:40:04] dies me up no thank you
[1:40:07] foreign
[1:40:09] do you understand the
[1:40:13] the the wounds that you can cause upon
[1:40:15] Satan's kingdom
[1:40:17] because God's given you a sword
[1:40:20] and you can slice them and dice them
[1:40:22] this morning you can cut it from hither
[1:40:24] To Yonder
[1:40:29] it's a king's sword and he said a king's
[1:40:32] sword he said no thee King sword
[1:40:36] not just a king that lived and had a
[1:40:39] kingdom and he died and he don't there's
[1:40:41] resemblance of things now and there's
[1:40:43] buildings left in his honor and you can
[1:40:45] go look at no no this ain't a king that
[1:40:47] just died this is the king that died and
[1:40:50] rose again
[1:40:53] it's the king's sword
[1:40:57] amen the word that'll defeat the enemy
[1:41:00] not just a sword of a king but the king
[1:41:03] the king who stepped out on nothing
[1:41:07] and created everything
[1:41:10] a king who stepped out on nothing and it
[1:41:13] created everything the king who spoke
[1:41:16] and light as a sword went out and it cut
[1:41:18] away Darkness
[1:41:21] and it broke the stronghold of Darkness
[1:41:23] that was upon the Earth he had faith in
[1:41:25] his word therefore he spoke it and had
[1:41:28] come to pass
[1:41:30] and this king's sword
[1:41:33] when you take it into your life and it
[1:41:36] comes out of your mouth it's sharp
[1:41:37] enough still yet today to cut every
[1:41:40] devil
[1:41:41] to cut every sickness every torment
[1:41:44] Spirit off of you
[1:41:46] that's why I've seen it right in the
[1:41:48] midst of preaching the word Empower
[1:41:50] being spoken and it'll go right out to
[1:41:53] where somebody is being tormented by a
[1:41:55] spirit you go
[1:41:58] and all of a sudden they'll realize I'm
[1:42:00] free
[1:42:00] [Applause]
[1:42:02] I'm free just has to speak it of the
[1:42:04] word the preaching of the word went
[1:42:06] forth it cut it out of my life
[1:42:08] [Music]
[1:42:11] he has faith in his word it will
[1:42:13] accomplish that what is sent to do
[1:42:15] therefore we must allow his mind and his
[1:42:19] thoughts that are higher than our
[1:42:21] thoughts thank God they're higher than
[1:42:23] our thoughts and they bet that thought
[1:42:26] of God be what comes out of our mind
[1:42:35] now we know
[1:42:37] but Bram talked about the hand of faith
[1:42:41] she talks about how strong it is
[1:42:44] not again a literal hand that you're
[1:42:46] holding a sword this morning
[1:42:49] but it has to be faith
[1:42:52] instead of the hand of faith is strong
[1:42:54] enough
[1:42:55] it'll cut a little hole through Darkness
[1:42:57] and it'll say by faith I'm saved
[1:43:01] that's a great cut
[1:43:03] but then if it'll all the stronger that
[1:43:05] hand is to yield the sword then that's
[1:43:07] all it can cut but if it's a strong hand
[1:43:09] it'll cut Plumb through everything the
[1:43:11] devil's put there and it'll make every
[1:43:14] promise of God shine forth in the power
[1:43:16] of his resurrection if it's a strong
[1:43:18] hand of faith
[1:43:19] the sword is plenty sharp it's plenty
[1:43:23] powerful it's plenty able it just needs
[1:43:26] somebody that'll use it it means he's
[1:43:29] somebody that picks up the thoughts of
[1:43:31] God and reveals them by speaking the
[1:43:34] word of God
[1:43:38] now the word will cut in there if
[1:43:40] there's enough harm behind it to push it
[1:43:42] in it'll find a place it'll find a place
[1:43:45] to cut if you just get a strong enough
[1:43:47] arm behind it the sword picked up an arm
[1:43:50] of Faith grip it tight hold on to it
[1:43:52] walk into the face of the enemy he says
[1:43:54] how can that uncircumcised devil ever
[1:43:57] stand in the presence of the Eternal God
[1:43:59] so you take the sword of the presence of
[1:44:02] the Eternal God and every promise that
[1:44:04] belongs to you and you pick it up with
[1:44:06] that hand of faith and you walk forth if
[1:44:08] you say I need healing cut it out
[1:44:12] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:44:14] and forever if you need salvation every
[1:44:17] promise and the Bible is mine
[1:44:23] he'll do it
[1:44:28] he said what does the spirit fight with
[1:44:32] the Holy Spirit fight with Sensations
[1:44:36] feelings
[1:44:38] no no
[1:44:39] Lord knows our feelings that give up on
[1:44:41] us real quick
[1:44:43] and we don't always feel God around us
[1:44:50] what does a Spirit fight with it fights
[1:44:53] with the word
[1:44:56] Glory
[1:44:57] feelings no word word word word
[1:45:00] let's fight with the word the spirit of
[1:45:03] God walks right up to the devil and says
[1:45:06] it is written
[1:45:08] it is written and the devil starts
[1:45:11] moving back you take the sword which is
[1:45:13] the word of God he said brother take the
[1:45:15] word take the spirit let the Spirit come
[1:45:17] to your heart and say open up your mind
[1:45:19] and say Thy word is what's true he said
[1:45:21] you do this sister Thy word is truth

[1:45:26] attention to how I feel what anybody

[1:45:42] and I'm coming right down to where
[1:45:44] you're at
[1:45:46] with the word and I grabbed the faith of
[1:45:49] God and the sword of the spirit and I
[1:45:52] say thus saith the Lord
[1:45:55] and then scream Hallelujah

[1:49:37] Pentecostal Waters
[1:49:39] and I don't care if I got a fight
[1:49:41] through 16 miles up and listening well I
[1:49:44] got that one where's the next one that
[1:49:46] yard got that one where's the next one
[1:49:51] some of you this morning need to pick up
[1:49:53] your sword and make that depression
[1:49:55] devil's head roll across this floor
[1:50:00] and then you go over there and you get
[1:50:02] that old head and you say look at here
[1:50:05] look what God has done
[1:50:10] Hallelujah where's the next one
[1:50:16] Hallelujah where's the next one
[1:50:31] Abraham had to whack his way
[1:50:34] all the way through every kind of doubt
[1:50:46] and we're supposed to be royal Seed of
[1:50:48] Abraham
[1:50:49] yeah
[1:50:51] well I don't know about pulling swords
[1:50:56] we're trying to be peaceful
[1:50:58] I ain't got no desire to make peace with
[1:51:00] the Enemy
[1:51:04] because you know if you make peace with
[1:51:05] him you give him a Lynch inch he'll take
[1:51:08] a mile
[1:51:09] I asked Joshua
[1:51:12] those people that does that deceive them
[1:51:14] you know why they got deceived because
[1:51:16] they didn't go to the word
[1:51:19] they took their own feelings their own
[1:51:21] thoughts what they thought these men
[1:51:23] came with uh uh their you know moldy
[1:51:26] bread and though all their skins had
[1:51:29] made where they looked old and they'd
[1:51:30] come from a far off place and we've
[1:51:33] heard what your God will do and how
[1:51:35] great he is and we want to make sure
[1:51:37] that you don't come to we ain't nowhere
[1:51:39] close to where you're at we're way over
[1:51:41] here
[1:51:43] instead of Joshua going to the word of
[1:51:45] God they had the word of God in their
[1:51:47] days called the uroma thumb and they
[1:51:49] could ask the questions and it would
[1:51:50] have lit
[1:51:52] and it would have told them exactly what
[1:51:53] the devil was saying
[1:51:55] but they failed to go to it they failed
[1:51:57] to question the word of God and they
[1:51:59] allowed their feelings and what they saw
[1:52:01] take precedent over what the word of God
[1:52:03] and they made peace with the Enemy and
[1:52:05] that peace began to afflict them they
[1:52:07] found out they live right next to them
[1:52:09] right in their own promises right in
[1:52:12] their own place right where God had
[1:52:14] given them and they failed it because
[1:52:16] they didn't use the word
[1:52:18] [Applause]
[1:52:21] amen how many times have we allowed
[1:52:24] ourselves to make peace
[1:52:28] well I'll tell you what brother Timothy
[1:52:30] every time there's a little movement in
[1:52:32] the church and I get excited I tell you
[1:52:34] what the Devil comes on me after that
[1:52:36] and he can bring such a nervousness upon
[1:52:38] me and he hurts me and he does this and
[1:52:41] all next week I got all kind of troubles
[1:52:43] whoa
[1:52:46] you know what that tells me you need to
[1:52:48] whack a little harder
[1:52:50] you need to whack a little longer you
[1:52:53] need to whack to that Devil's Head comes
[1:52:55] off
[1:52:57] and when he comes at you on Monday
[1:52:59] morning you already have your sword out

[1:53:29] was somebody especially somebody after
[1:53:31] them they didn't put it away over there
[1:53:33] no no it was right there

[1:53:41] this is why David said I've heard Thy
[1:53:43] word in my heart
[1:53:46] it's an easy grabbing distance
[1:53:48] now when that enemy wants to come at you
[1:53:50] during the night you start speaking the
[1:53:52] word

[1:54:05] come and ruin your night's rest
[1:54:08] amen you'll show him the in the morning

[1:54:14] want you to pull all those covers back
[1:54:16] and say devil I don't come to you in my
[1:54:18] name I don't come to you in my strength
[1:54:20] but I come to you in the name of the
[1:54:22] Lord Jesus Christ

[2:04:50] oh speaking
[2:04:55] that was unplanned thank you Lord
[2:04:59] speaking lies

[2:05:16] good
[2:05:17] but all one day while you was in that

[2:05:50] the shell
[2:05:59] you're not a chicken you're an eagle
[2:06:05] Satan tied you up down there but there's
[2:06:07] a word this morning that's releasing you

[2:06:29] come on somebody it'll never pass away
[2:06:32] it's mine from now through eternity
[2:06:35] [Applause]
[2:06:39] Satan cannot hold it as long as you go
[2:06:42] into him with the scriptural
[2:06:44] authoritative word with faith and say
[2:06:46] lay it down
[2:06:48] it's mine Satan you lay it down you took
[2:06:51] it for me but you got you give it back
[2:06:53] because this morning I'm serving notice
[2:06:56] on you
[2:06:58] oh and it's not a notice that I have
[2:07:01] said it's a notice that he said
[2:07:04] but I found out you hid it from me and
[2:07:07] you try to keep it tied up in courts but
[2:07:10] the judges spoke on my behalf and he
[2:07:12] said hey Timothy your name is wrote
[2:07:15] right here
[2:07:17] your name is wrote right here
[2:07:22] there might be people that tries to
[2:07:24] cheat you out of houses and teach you
[2:07:27] how to land and try to hide it that your
[2:07:29] name wasn't on The Inheritance but in
[2:07:31] God's word it's a voice that speaks this
[2:07:34] morning it says your name has been found
[2:07:36] on his and word
[2:07:38] [Applause]
[2:07:45] hey man
[2:07:48] Hallelujah I'm feeling good
[2:07:56] y'all understand if you want to but I
[2:07:57] ain't done
[2:08:00] God's word will come to pass
[2:08:04] if you say to this mountain
[2:08:06] and don't doubt in your heart but
[2:08:09] believe what you said
[2:08:11] will come to pass
[2:08:14] he said when you go to the devil and you
[2:08:17] begin to speak to the word the word to
[2:08:20] him he said that don't just get him
[2:08:21] started that gets him running
[2:08:26] um
[2:08:30] lay it down
[2:08:32] because I've come with a scriptural
[2:08:34] Authority I am a believer
[2:08:40] what did Abraham do first in order to do
[2:08:43] this he had to lay his faith upon a
[2:08:45] solid rock Foundation of God's promised
[2:08:48] word
[2:08:50] look the only thing he had was a little
[2:08:52] when he went to go deliver a lot he had
[2:08:54] just a bunch of servants
[2:08:55] maybe a dozen maybe a few few men
[2:08:59] up against maybe a thousand
[2:09:02] men wasn't soldiers they were servants
[2:09:04] they were Cattlemen they were sheep men
[2:09:05] they were herders
[2:09:06] there's some old rusty knives they'd
[2:09:08] picked up somewhere
[2:09:10] but Abraham wasn't looking at a rusty
[2:09:12] knife he wasn't looking at a shield he
[2:09:15] was looking at his faith laying upon the
[2:09:17] word of God
[2:09:18] that what does it that's what does it
[2:09:20] that's what does it your faith laying
[2:09:23] upon a written word of God how are you
[2:09:25] going to fight them when you get there
[2:09:26] it's not up to me
[2:09:29] it's not it's up to me to lay my faith
[2:09:31] on what God said that's mine I'm going
[2:09:34] after what belongs to me he said when
[2:09:37] people that's sick can see that the
[2:09:39] sickness is just about over right then
[2:09:44] Oh Glory when a sinner can see that you
[2:09:47] don't have to sin
[2:09:50] that's a powerful thought
[2:09:53] a lot of people they sin because they
[2:09:55] have to sin that's a pitiful shape when
[2:09:57] you say you have to sin but when you
[2:09:59] realize you don't have to sin no more
[2:10:01] there's people that can stand up and
[2:10:03] curse and laugh in your face and call
[2:10:05] you an idiot and everything else
[2:10:06] willfully Center see there's no hope for
[2:10:09] them but the man who does something
[2:10:10] constantly they don't want to do he
[2:10:12] steals and he don't want to he lies and
[2:10:14] he don't want to he he does things he
[2:10:16] doesn't want to he doesn't want to be a
[2:10:18] sinner There's Hope for him if he can
[2:10:20] let if he can let him see the truth come
[2:10:23] up to God's promise and lay your faith
[2:10:25] on that walk out there to the enemy he
[2:10:27] just simply can't hold it no longer
[2:10:29] that's all because it's yours
[2:10:32] he just simply can't hold it no longer
[2:10:34] that's all because it's yours
[2:10:39] I read that again
[2:10:41] the enemy he simply just simply can't
[2:10:44] hold it no longer at all because it's
[2:10:48] yours
[2:10:51] Abraham said I'm an heir this belongs to
[2:10:54] me everything in this land belongs to me
[2:10:56] why because God said it did
[2:11:00] now we're heir of all things we're heir
[2:11:02] of all things the Bible just said just
[2:11:04] got through saying so here we're air of
[2:11:07] all things everything we don't possess
[2:11:08] it yet but it's ours I don't own us an
[2:11:12] inch of land but all and but it's all
[2:11:14] mine it's all yours belongs to the
[2:11:16] people the church the Believers the
[2:11:17] bride of Christ owns every Speck of it
[2:11:23] Russia's fighting for United States are
[2:11:25] fighting for it this one's fighting
[2:11:27] against that one that one they call us
[2:11:28] crazy
[2:11:30] just sit still you own it
[2:11:36] this Earth was not created for Satan and
[2:11:39] his angels this Earth was created for
[2:11:42] God's people
[2:11:49] just sit still you own it
[2:11:52] it's going to fall air to it let them
[2:11:54] fuss blow up one another it belongs to
[2:11:56] us
[2:11:57] we're the ones that'll get it they'll
[2:12:00] never even think it but we do
[2:12:02] who would have thought that a little
[2:12:04] poor man up there with those little
[2:12:05] skinny bony cattle on top of the hill
[2:12:07] owned all of it all of Palestine
[2:12:10] belonged to him yes sir so when it came
[2:12:12] to a place that Showdown came God proved
[2:12:14] to him to be with him he took that
[2:12:17] little handful of men and went out there
[2:12:18] and slaughtered every one of them and
[2:12:20] brought back his possession he laid his
[2:12:22] faith upon God's Rock promise that's
[2:12:26] what it takes he didn't build another
[2:12:27] Foundation he didn't go join another
[2:12:29] organization he laid his faith upon a
[2:12:33] promise he marched out there Rusty sword
[2:12:35] and not Rusty sword made no difference
[2:12:37] to him his faith was laying on a promise
[2:12:40] and when you come forth to be prayed for
[2:12:42] if you want salvation if you want Divine
[2:12:44] Healing no matter what it is if you are
[2:12:46] a Believer you're an heir to every
[2:12:48] promise so lay your faith upon a promise
[2:12:51] and March forward and say Satan give it
[2:12:54] back
[2:12:55] give it back it's mine don't let him
[2:12:58] Bluff you he'll stand there sometimes
[2:13:00] but he has to give it back that is your
[2:13:03] inheritance and you have the authority
[2:13:06] because you are an heir to it
[2:13:17] we see
[2:13:23] let me go back here he says
[2:13:25] after the battle
[2:13:27] Who come out to meet him
[2:13:29] Melchizedek
[2:13:31] the one who had given him the word
[2:13:38] his word
[2:13:41] he got the Victory and now he returned
[2:13:44] back and he had fellowship with the one
[2:13:46] who had given him the promise
[2:13:49] oh his word will become something new to
[2:13:52] you
[2:13:52] whenever you get once you get the
[2:13:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost you say well I
[2:13:56] can't see these things I don't believe
[2:13:57] in shouting I don't believe in spoken
[2:13:59] speaking in tongues I don't believe in
[2:14:01] Divine Healing it just shows you don't
[2:14:03] got the victory
[2:14:05] but one time because it's in the word
[2:14:08] now I know man tries to take it out but
[2:14:11] who cares what men does
[2:14:15] it's God's spoken
[2:14:17] and he's the same yesterday today and
[2:14:18] forever it's God's word that promises
[2:14:20] and we believe it because we're in there
[2:14:22] therefore I'm an heir of Divine Healing

[2:14:27] be happy

[2:17:22] to put on him is what God Said at the
[2:17:24] beginning and God said Justin your
[2:17:27] name's on it
[2:17:29] but another Heir took her position and
[2:17:31] spoke the word of God and it went
[2:17:33] through the Realms of the Darkness and
[2:17:36] Light fell upon a bed
[2:17:38] what was it it was a sword drawn by a
[2:17:42] little 16 year old girl and said I've
[2:17:44] come to take my brother back
