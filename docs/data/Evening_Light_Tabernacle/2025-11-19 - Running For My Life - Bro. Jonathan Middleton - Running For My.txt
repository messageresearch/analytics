========================================

[music] Oh yes, I'm running. Oh yes, I'm running. Well, I'm [music and singing] running the race of my life. I got to meet that chariot [music] of fire. Take my flight into the sky. I'm running. [singing] I'm running for my life. Well, now I'm in a race [music] to the rapture. Oh yes, I've crossed that old Jordan [music] River. And now I'm running to Canaan. I'm in the [music and singing] stature of a perfect man. I'm like a fountain waiting for directly. Oh yes, I'm running. Praise God. I'm running. Oh, [music and singing] I'm running the race of my life. I [music] got to beat that cherry on [singing] fire. Take my flight into the sky. So, I'm running. [music and singing] I'm running for my life. Well, now I say doubt and unbelief. You know, they were blazing [music] down that trail ahead of me. But now I've [music] laid these weights aside by faith. I've got to get that right. So now I'm running. I'm running for my [music] life. Well, now I say down and unbelief. [music] Oh, they [singing] were heavy burners holding down my feet. Oh, but [music] I laid these weights aside by faith. I've got to get that right. And now I'm running. I'm running for my life. [music] Well, now I see faith, hope, and charity. [music] Oh, they were blazing down [singing] that trail ahead of me. [music] Oh, but I caught them on the seventh. God put all things [music] under my feet. That's why I'm running. I'm running for my life. [music] Oh yes, I'm running. Thank God I'm running. Oh saints, I'm [music] running the race of my life. I've got to beat that cherry on fire. [music] Take my flight into the sky. While I'm running, I'm running for my life. Now it's [music] in that chamber of the pyramid. You in there with me? [music] It's in that secret place of my Jesus. That's where I did. Don't you see? He gave me the sneak preview and he told me I want to be Joseph. But now I'm [music] running. I'm running for my life. Well, [music and singing] and pretty soon that chariot will swing low. And when I hear [music] that trumpet sound, saints, I got to go. Well, I got [music] to hurry. I can't be late. All my stuff's waiting at the B. And now I'm [music] running. I'm running for my life. Oh yes, I'm [music] running. Praise God. I'm running. Oh, I'm running the [singing] race of my life. I got to meet [music] that cherry on fire. Take my flight to the sky. [music] I'm running. I'm running for my life. Now I'm saying [music] Satan, you got to shout. Don't you know those seven thunder they [music] sounded and brought you out? And now my destiny's been revealed. I've heard my name and I know I'm [music] s. That's why I'm running. I'm running for my life. Well, now [music] I've got to sing something. You got to shout. Don't you [music] see those seven? They sounded and brought you out. And now my destiny's been revealed. I've heard my name and I know I feel. That's [music] why I'm running. I'm running for my life. Run with me. Praise [music] God. I'm running. Oh, [singing] I'm running. Well, I'm running [music] the race of my life. I got to beat that cherry on my take [music and singing] my body to the sky. I'm running. I'm running for my life. [music] Oh, I'm running. I'm running for my love. [music and singing] [applause]
