[13:42] Just take a moment and tell him thank

[13:47] brother David Dexter if you'd come open
[13:49] the service for us in prayer as he
[13:51] comes. Want to continue to remember to
[13:53] pray for Sister Sharon Baxter. She had
[13:55] the surgery u earlier this week and has
[13:58] been recovering doing better but ask
[14:00] that we'd continue to remember her in
[14:01] prayer. Also, brother Tim is away
[14:03] ministering in Ohio this morning. Want
[14:06] to remember the services there as well
[14:08] as brother Joe in New Mexico. Brother
[14:10] Aaron is in Virginia. So, everybody's
[14:13] traveling all over the country today,
[14:15] but certainly certainly happy to be here
[14:18] this morning putting our licks of fire
[14:20] together and amen. Let's just go to him
[14:22] together in prayer. If you have a need
[14:24] you want to lift to the Lord and say,
[14:26] "Father, come by my way." I know there's
[14:28] many, many serious needs this morning.
[14:31] God sees every one of them.
[14:33] Amen. Amen. Let's just go to prayer.
[14:36] Father, we thank you for another day
[14:38] that we could come and worship you in
[14:39] spirit and in truth. Thank you for your
[14:42] minister that's in the back that's
[14:44] already prepared. Father, ask that you
[14:46] just anoint him today, Lord. that you
[14:48] just use him in a mighty way, Lord. Not
[14:51] knowing what he's going to speak on, but
[14:53] just knowing that you have the service
[14:54] and control. You know, each one that
[14:56] would be here today, Father. Lord,
[14:58] you're a God that's rich in mercy. Like
[15:00] that quote on the wall is showing there.
[15:03] Lord, such a wonderful sermon. Just
[15:05] makes me think, Lord, of the the story
[15:08] of that lieutenant that heard there was
[15:11] a Zar coming and he was going to look
[15:13] over his regiment and he'd done so much
[15:15] wrong. He'd stolen money from the
[15:16] government and he was there in just an
[15:19] awful place and he sat down to make it
[15:22] all right and wrote down everything that
[15:23] he'd done wrong. And at the end he put a
[15:26] note. He said, "A great debt. Who could
[15:29] pay it?" And that morning he fell asleep
[15:32] with a gun beside him to he was going to
[15:34] kill himself when he woke up. While he
[15:37] while he slept, the zar came, saw him
[15:40] sleeping, and at the bottom of the note,
[15:43] he wrote Nicholas and left the money.
[15:46] Resolved all dissolved all the debt of
[15:48] that man. Lord, and there's one greater
[15:50] Lord. No matter the debt, no matter what
[15:53] we have today, no matter the sinner in
[15:55] our midst and what they the things they
[15:57] look upon and they say, "How could I
[15:59] ever get past this? How could it ever be
[16:01] paid off in full?" There's one Jesus
[16:04] Christ greater than all the debt that
[16:06] they could have accumulated. And you
[16:08] already wrote your name, signed it in
[16:09] blood, paid it all, and all to you we
[16:13] owe today. Father, we just love you,
[16:15] Father. Ask you'd come down in the
[16:17] service, Lord. We just give ourselves to
[16:19] you. We welcome you, Father. Lord, if
[16:22] there's anything today that's been done,
[16:23] anything said through the week, Lord,
[16:25] that would grieve you, Lord. Ask that
[16:26] you just forgive us, Lord, that you
[16:28] would just feel welcome, welcome to come
[16:30] into this place, Lord God.
[16:33] We invite you, Lord. I expect, Lord,
[16:35] that the services going on around the
[16:37] country today that you would just be in
[16:38] them, Lord. You'd use Brother Tim. You'd
[16:40] use Brother Joe, Brother Aaron, Lord
[16:43] God, that just reach the lost, meet the
[16:45] needs of your people wherever they would
[16:47] be, Father. Lord, that you're that kind
[16:49] of a God. You do all things well. You
[16:51] meet all the needs,
[16:53] Lord. And we're just expecting you to do
[16:56] that today,
[16:57] Father. We love you, Father. Ask that
[17:00] you just come now. deal with each heart
[17:02] that's here. Father, if there's a sinner
[17:05] in our midst, Lord, I ask that they'd
[17:06] just experience you, Lord, like they
[17:08] never have in their life. Lord, you'd be
[17:11] so close, so near, and they'd realize
[17:14] that you have love, deep love for them
[17:16] and your desire is that they would be
[17:18] right and in fellowship with you. We
[17:20] just love you, Father. Give ourselves to
[17:21] you, give the service to you. Each song,
[17:23] Lord, we just ask that you just be
[17:25] pleased with everything. Jesus Christ's
[17:28] name we ask. Amen.
[17:31] [Music]
[17:35] Amen. And the brothers can take up the
[17:37] offering this morning.
[17:42] And as they do,
[17:46] uh, brother David was mentioning in his
[17:50] prayer that it was signed in his
[17:53] blood. Ask sister Laura Burns if she
[17:56] would get ready to sing that song. There
[17:59] is a blood. Amen. Do you believe that
[18:01] there is a blood
[18:03] that causes the blind to
[18:06] see, causes the sick to be
[18:10] healed?
[18:12] Amen.
[18:14] Amen. Amen. How many's wake this
[18:17] morning?
[18:20] Amen.
[18:23] Amen. Amen. Keep G.
[18:28] [Music]
[18:33] Hallelujah.
[18:35] Hallelujah. Amen. Just before she sings
[18:38] this
[18:41] song, paid in full by the blood of the
[18:47] lamb. Oh, free from sin. Free to live.
[18:52] Now I am.
[18:56] Oh, it reads on the page where my sins
[19:01] were written down, paid in full by the
[19:05] blood of the
[19:09] lamb. Oh, how great was the debt that I
[19:15] owe. Bound to pay for the seeds I had
[19:20] sown.
[19:23] Hope in Jesus my Lord. A great treasure
[19:28] I have found. I'm redeemed by the blood
[19:33] of the
[19:35] lamb. Oh, paid in
[19:39] full. Oh, of the
[19:42] lamb and free from sin. Free to live.
[19:46] Now I am.
[19:50] Oh, it
[19:52] reads, "Oh, where my sins were written
[19:56] down, paid in full by the blood." Oh,
[20:00] sing that other verse again. And oh, how
[20:04] great was the debt that I
[20:08] owe. Oh, bow to pay for the sin I had
[20:14] sown.
[20:17] But in Jesus my Lord, a great treasure I
[20:22] have found. I'm redeemed by the blood of
[20:27] the lamb. Oh, it's paid in full by the
[20:32] blood of the
[20:35] lamb. Oh, free from
[20:38] sin. Oh, now I am.
[20:43] And it reads on the page where my sins
[20:48] were written
[20:50] down by the blood. Amen. Amen. You can
[20:55] be seated for just a moment.
[21:07] [Music]
[21:19] That cost a
[21:22] life that paid my
[21:29] [Music]
[21:34] way down from the
[21:38] cross. My sins were
[21:43] gone. My sins
[21:47] forgot. There is a
[21:51] grave that tried to
[21:56] hide this
[21:58] precious
[22:00] blood that gave me life.
[22:05] But in three
[22:08] days he breathed
[22:12] again and rose to
[22:16] stand in my
[22:21] defense. And so I
[22:24] come to tell you he's
[22:28] alive. to tell you that it
[22:32] dries every tear that
[22:37] falls. And so I
[22:40] come to tell you that he
[22:44] saves, to shout, and to
[22:48] proclaim that he's coming back for you.
[22:54] There is a
[22:57] blood that sides the
[23:01] blind that heals the
[23:05] sick and the lonely he finds.
[23:11] It has the
[23:12] [Music]
[23:14] power to free the
[23:17] bound as chains they
[23:22] fall upon the ground.
[23:26] So pour it
[23:29] out to cleanse my
[23:33] soul and let his
[23:38] faith glory
[23:41] flow because he
[23:45] lives to make me
[23:49] whole. I owe my
[23:53] life. I owe my
[23:58] all. So I
[24:00] come to tell you he's
[24:05] alive. To tell you that he
[24:08] [Music]
[24:09] dries every tear that
[24:13] falls. And so I
[24:16] come to tell you that he
[24:20] saves, to shout, and to
[24:24] proclaim that he's coming back for
[24:31] you. Oh, one can wash
[24:36] away my sin.
[24:40] Nothing but the blood of
[24:45] [Music]
[24:47] Jesus. And what can make me whole
[24:55] again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[25:02] [Applause]
[25:02] [Music]
[25:04] And
[25:06] oh precious
[25:09] is the
[25:12] flow
[25:14] that makes me white as
[25:19] snow and
[25:22] no
[25:24] other found I
[25:28] know nothing but the
[25:32] blood of Jes.
[25:34] [Music]
[25:38] Jesus. So I
[25:41] come to tell you he's
[25:45] alive. To tell you that he
[25:50] dries every tear that falls.
[25:56] So I
[25:58] come to tell you that he
[26:02] saves to shout and to
[26:06] proclaim that he's coming back for
[26:15] [Music]
[26:18] [Applause]

[26:25] Amen. We can say thank you for the
[26:29] cross,

[38:32] friend. And I've been to the water. And
[38:36] I've been baptized. I've been washed in
[38:40] the blood of the
[38:43] lamb. Oh, I've been changed from the
[38:46] creature.
[38:49] blessed. Oh, redeemed is now my
[38:54] name. And I've been
[38:57] changed. I've been
[38:59] reborn. All my life has been
[39:05] rearranged. And what a difference it
[39:08] makes when the Lord has his way. All my
[39:12] life. Praise God for my sins. And though
[39:17] my sins were as scarlet, they're white
[39:21] as snow. I was found, but today I am
[39:26] free. And I was lost in the
[39:30] darkness. Now I'm found. I was blind,
[39:34] but now I
[39:37] see. And I've been
[39:40] changed. I've been
[39:42] reborn. All my life has been
[39:48] free. What a difference it makes when
[39:52] the Lord has his way. All my life.
[39:56] Praise God has been changed.
[39:59] When at last in his presence I'll stand
[40:04] above.
[40:05] [Applause]
[40:08] Oh, from my eyes.
[40:12] Oh yes.
[40:17] Beyond the
[40:19] sky. Well, I've been

[40:25] reborn. All my life has been
[40:30] reigned. And what a difference it makes.
[40:38] Praise God. Has been
[40:42] changed.
[40:44] Hallelujah. How many has experienced his
[40:46] change in
[40:47] power? Amen. Amen. Let's just go to him
[40:51] in prayer today. Father, we just come to
[40:54] you once again, Lord.
[40:56] as a needy people, Father having needs,
[41:00] no doubt, all across this building,
[41:02] Father, situations and things,
[41:05] questions, we just ask, Lord, you'll
[41:07] come and just help us again today as we
[41:10] take these words, Lord, you've laid upon
[41:12] our
[41:13] heart. Just ask, Lord, you'll just open
[41:16] it up, open the book to us today, Lord,
[41:19] and show us things once again, a fresh
[41:21] and a new.
[41:23] Lord, we just ask God you'll feed our
[41:25] hungry souls. We ask it this morning.
[41:28] Bless each heart. Bless each home, each
[41:31] individual that's gathered here. Lord,
[41:33] we ask, Father, you'll just come in a
[41:35] mighty way in Jesus name.
[41:39] Amen. Amen. We turn our Bibles to
[41:41] Genesis 22 verse
[41:45] one.
[41:47] Amen. Also, 1 Peter 4:19.
[42:02] Amen. Says, "And it came to pass after
[42:04] these things that God did tempt Abraham
[42:08] said unto him,"Abraham, and he said,
[42:09] Behold, here am I." And he said, ' Take
[42:13] now thy son, thy only son Isaac, whom
[42:16] thou lovest, and get thee into the land
[42:19] of Mariah, and offer him there for a
[42:22] burnt offering upon one of the
[42:23] mountains, which I will tell thee of."
[42:26] And Abraham rose up early in the morning
[42:29] and saddled his ass, and took two of his
[42:32] young men with him, and Isaac his son,
[42:35] and claved the wood for the burnt
[42:36] offering, and rose up, and went unto the
[42:39] place of which God had told him. Then on
[42:42] the third day, Abraham lifted up his
[42:44] eyes, and saw the place a far off. And
[42:48] Abraham said unto the his young men,
[42:50] "Abide here with the ass, and I and the
[42:53] lad will go yonder and worship, and come
[42:56] again unto you." And Abraham took the
[42:58] wood of the burnt offering, and laid it
[43:00] upon Isaac his son, and took the fire in
[43:03] his hand, and a knife, and they went
[43:05] both of them together. And Isaac spake
[43:08] unto Abraham his father, and said, "My
[43:10] father." And he said, "Here am I, my
[43:12] son." And he said, "Behold the fire and
[43:14] the wood, but where is the lamb for a
[43:17] burnt
[43:18] offering?" And Abraham said, "My son,
[43:20] God will provide himself a lamb for a
[43:23] burnt offering." So they went both of
[43:26] them together, and they came to the
[43:27] place which God had told him of. And
[43:29] Abraham built an altar there, and laid
[43:32] the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
[43:34] son, and laid him on the altar upon the
[43:37] wood. And Abraham stretched forth his
[43:40] hand and took the knife to slay his son.
[43:43] And the angel of the Lord called unto
[43:44] him out of heaven and said,"Abraham,
[43:46] Abraham." And he said, "Here I am." And
[43:48] he said, "Lay not thy hand upon the lad,
[43:51] neither do thou anything unto him. For
[43:53] now I knowest that thou fierce God. See,
[43:56] and thou was thou hast not withheld thy
[43:59] son, thy only son, from me." And Abraham
[44:02] lifted up his eyes and looked and beheld
[44:04] behind him a ram caught in a thicket by
[44:08] his thorns. And Abraham went and took
[44:10] the ram and offered him up for a burnt
[44:13] offering instead of his son. And Abraham
[44:16] called the name of the place Jehovah
[44:18] Gyra as it is said to this day in the
[44:21] mount of the Lord it shall be seen. Also
[44:25] 1 Peter 4 and verse
[44:27] 19 says, "Wherefore let them that suffer
[44:31] according to the will of God commit the
[44:34] keeping of their souls to him in
[44:37] welloing as unto a faithful creator."
[44:42] Amen. God bless you today. You can be
[44:46] seated. Just like to speak to you for a
[44:49] moment on faith and our faithful
[44:52] creator. Amen. And I'm thankful to have
[44:54] a faithful creator.
[44:57] Amen. But I I want to pick up the story
[44:59] a little bit before where we read from
[45:01] Abraham. And because we know God had
[45:03] given Abraham a promise and when he gave
[45:06] him a promise of a son, Abraham wasn't,
[45:08] you know, a 20-year-old man as we know
[45:10] the story. Uh but he was around 75 years
[45:14] old and his wife, you know, around 65
[45:17] and told him they was going to have a
[45:18] child. And you know, he made this
[45:21] covenant with Abraham that this was
[45:23] going to happen. And it was an
[45:25] unconditional covenant. It wasn't really
[45:27] dependent on what Abraham could do or
[45:30] what Abraham could not
[45:32] do upon God. And you know, when God
[45:34] makes a covenant between a him and a man
[45:37] and you know, usually the man will break
[45:39] his covenant, but God always keeps his.
[45:42] You know, a man, you know, we know his
[45:44] men, they can they can make deals or
[45:46] make covenants. And generally uh if they
[45:49] if they're not careful, they can break
[45:50] them. But God, if he makes a covenant,
[45:52] he has never broken one promise. And God
[45:56] made this covenant by to himself upon
[45:59] himself. God put it to Abraham and he
[46:01] gave it to Abraham. Not if Abraham would
[46:04] do something, but God said, "I have
[46:06] already done it. It's a finished thing.
[46:09] It's completely wholly done, and it's by
[46:12] grace." And and we know the scripture
[46:14] says that he swore by himself because he
[46:17] could swear by no greater. Not not you
[46:20] will Abraham but I will sayeth the Lord.
[46:23] And and so it was not on conditions at
[46:25] all. It was God's covenant. Not only
[46:28] Abraham but but this covenant was not
[46:30] only to Abraham but to his seed after
[46:33] him. And we know the seed of Abraham the
[46:35] physical seed is the Jewish people. But
[46:38] the covenant, amen, was also not just to
[46:40] his physical seed, but we were also made
[46:43] to be of his spiritual seed of Abraham.
[46:46] And and and we know that as we can read
[46:48] in the Bible, and we don't have time to
[46:50] go into all these little details, but we
[46:52] know the gentile church was that wild
[46:55] olive tree of Ezekiel that was grafted
[46:57] in. And Paul tells us that which is, you
[47:00] know, that which is outwardly is not
[47:02] Jew, but that which is inwardly is
[47:04] Abraham's seed. So outwardly we're
[47:06] gentile, but inwardly we're of Abraham's
[47:09] seed. And we being dead in Christ, we
[47:11] take on the same seed of Abraham and we
[47:14] are heirs according to the same promise
[47:17] or to the same covenant. So the reason
[47:19] we're called Abraham's seed is because
[47:21] that Abraham's seed physically, you
[47:23] know, was speaking of Isaac and and you
[47:26] know, and Isaac was speaking of Christ.
[47:28] And Christ came down and he gave his
[47:30] life for us. And and he sent the Holy
[47:33] Spirit back to us to give us the same
[47:35] life. Amen. Which gives us the same
[47:38] faith that Abraham had when he received
[47:40] the fa I mean the the promise of
[47:43] circumcision. Amen. He believed God and
[47:45] it was imputed on him to righteousness.
[47:48] And and we can read about Abraham and we
[47:50] can see a lot of faults and we can see a
[47:52] lot of failures and we can see a lot of
[47:54] mistakes it would seem. But Amen. But
[47:56] when God would speak about him under the
[47:58] covenant of the lamb that we're under, I
[48:01] mean, the perfect lamb, he would say
[48:02] that Abraham was perfect. Abraham
[48:05] staggered not at the promises of God,
[48:07] but was strong in the faith. And and you
[48:10] know many times we want to the devil
[48:11] wants to come and he wants to point out
[48:13] all of our mistakes and all of our
[48:15] failures and how we've not done this or
[48:17] how we've not obtained this. But we got
[48:19] to understand again it's under an
[48:22] unconditional covenant. Amen. Amen.
[48:24] There is a perfect lamb for our
[48:26] sacrifice. So God is not looking at us
[48:29] this this morning, but God is looking at
[48:32] our sacrifice. And I I don't know about
[48:34] you, but that thrills my heart because I
[48:36] know I don't add up a whole lot of
[48:38] times. I don't reach to the point that I
[48:40] should reach. I don't obtain those
[48:42] places sometime. But I know that that
[48:44] God is not looking at me and my mistakes
[48:48] and my failures, but God is looking at
[48:50] my s at my perfect sacrifice. And so we
[48:54] see that, you know, when we also as
[48:56] Abraham, Amen, as he believed, it was
[48:58] imputed unto him for righteousness. And
[49:01] God gave him a sign, amen, a
[49:03] circumcision to confirm that he had
[49:05] recognized his faith. And today we also
[49:08] believe God with all of our heart and
[49:10] we've we've accepted his sacrifice and
[49:12] therefore God will recognize our faith.
[49:15] Amen. When he recognizes our faith, he
[49:18] sends back the Holy Spirit of promise
[49:21] and seals us unto our day of redemption.
[49:24] Amen. That take that should take all the
[49:26] scare out of us. That should take all
[49:28] the worry out of us that we have now
[49:31] been placed under the same covenant
[49:33] Abraham was placed under. We have been
[49:36] placed under the unconditional covenant
[49:38] that is not what I do is not my works. I
[49:41] have faith in not what I do or what I
[49:44] work. I have faith in a finished work
[49:46] that Christ has already done. Amen.
[49:49] Salvation is not what man can do.
[49:52] Salvation is in what Jesus has already
[49:55] done. Hallelujah. Healing is not in what
[49:58] man can do. Healing is in what God has
[50:01] already provided. Amen. So we see, amen,
[50:04] him sitting now, Jesus now as as sitting
[50:07] at the right hand of God making
[50:09] intercession upon our profession or or
[50:12] our confession. No matter, you know, how
[50:14] much you pray or how much you cry or how
[50:17] much you agonize or how much you do
[50:20] anything, that'll never be accepted. God
[50:22] can only accept your faith. And your
[50:25] faith is accepted upon your confession.
[50:28] And when you make that faith and that
[50:30] confession, then God recognizes it and
[50:32] he begins to act upon it just as he did.
[50:35] Amen. Abraham as he's walking up towards
[50:37] Mount Mariah and he see and and he sees
[50:41] amen in the distance and he and he tells
[50:43] the service to stay there and he says,
[50:46] "Amen, me and the lad were going to go
[50:48] and worship in that mountain, but me and
[50:50] the lad are going to return." Amen. He
[50:53] began to make a confession. and he began
[50:55] to know, amen, God has given me this
[50:57] promise, and God is not going to take
[50:59] this promise from me. He's He's not that
[51:01] kind of person. God's not somebody
[51:03] that'll give you something one day and
[51:05] take it away from you the next. Come on,
[51:08] somebody. Amen. This world can do that.
[51:10] This world can give you joy today and
[51:12] it'll take joy from you tomorrow. Amen.
[51:15] The world around us can take peace or
[51:18] give us peace today, but then tomorrow
[51:20] take it away. But God is not that kind
[51:22] of God. God, when he gives you
[51:24] something, you don't have to worry about
[51:26] him a few days later coming back and
[51:28] taking it back from you. But amen, if
[51:30] God gives you peace, Amen. God will
[51:33] allow you to keep that peace. God gives
[51:35] you joy. He will allow you to keep that
[51:37] joy. Amen. That's why we sing the song,
[51:39] I've got a joy that the world didn't
[51:41] give and the world can't take away.
[51:44] Hallelujah. That's the only way God is.
[51:46] He acts upon our confession. Amen. in
[51:50] the finished work. That's the basis even
[51:52] of divine healing. It is the confession
[51:54] on a finished work. Amen. Now, we know
[51:56] divine healing was included in the
[51:58] atonement and it's for whosoever will.
[52:01] So, amen. If someone even though they
[52:03] may not we we've seen it many times
[52:06] people that doesn't necessarily live a
[52:08] Christian life, but they grab a hold of
[52:09] the faith and that atonement has paid
[52:12] for their healing. Amen. Amen. That
[52:14] atonement and so a prostitute can come
[52:16] up and get healed. Somebody that's not
[52:18] living right can get healed. Why?
[52:20] Because Christ paid in the atonement.
[52:22] All it takes is someone to believe.
[52:25] Amen. So, Amen. So, we find that that
[52:28] that God foreseeing that. Amen. God was
[52:31] foreseeing. And this is what the story
[52:33] that we read today was all about the
[52:35] lamb that was coming. It wasn't about
[52:38] just about Isaac and the situation
[52:40] there. Although, while they were in it,
[52:42] that's what it was about, but it was
[52:43] speaking about or typing a lamb that was
[52:46] to come. Amen. A lamb that would take
[52:48] away sins. Not just cover sins, but take
[52:51] away sins. Amen. That's that that's the
[52:54] reason why we have a place. There was a
[52:55] place called paradise, you know. And
[52:57] they would they had a lamb that would
[52:59] cover their sins. But and it would take
[53:01] them when they died, they went to a
[53:02] place called up called paradise. But
[53:05] when Jesus died, sin wasn't just
[53:07] covered. It was divorced and done away
[53:10] with. And when he rose again, he emptied
[53:12] paradise and he led captivity captive.
[53:15] and he gave gifts unto men. So all the
[53:18] Old Testaments that died saints that
[53:20] died went with him after his
[53:22] resurrection and they appeared and they
[53:24] came and they they went and they for 40
[53:27] days or so. Why? Because that blood
[53:30] loosed them from what the first blood
[53:32] couldn't loose them from. Hallelujah. Do
[53:35] you realize what kind of loosing you're
[53:36] under today? That death can't hold you.
[53:39] Amen. The grave can't hold you. Sin
[53:42] can't hold you. Sickness can't hold you.
[53:44] This is the blood that we are under
[53:46] today.
[53:49] Amen. So when we go into the presence of
[53:52] the father and so now we can go into the
[53:55] presence of the father waiting amen for
[53:57] the second coming of the lord. There's
[53:59] no guesswork about it. It's a finished
[54:01] work. God has already done it. It's over
[54:03] with. But Abraham believe in God. He
[54:06] called those things as not that were not
[54:09] as though they
[54:11] were. Amen. He said, and so so he comes
[54:14] up and he goes on a little further than
[54:16] we read. He goes on a little further
[54:17] with Isaac. And Isaac must have been a
[54:20] pretty smart little boy. He must have
[54:21] been around some sacrifices before. He
[54:23] he must have realized something as he
[54:25] began to walk. He said, "Okay, we got
[54:27] the wood and we got the fire, but
[54:29] where's the
[54:31] sacrifice?" He's not realizing he's he's
[54:34] been the one that been called to lay up
[54:36] on the altar yet. And so, Amen. And it's
[54:38] a perfect type of Christ. We know we're
[54:40] not we're we're Bible students. We know,
[54:42] we've heard it before. Amen. As Abraham
[54:44] would lay the wood upon Isaac and he
[54:46] would begin to walk to that hill showing
[54:48] the perfect type of Christ. Amen. The
[54:50] cross being laid upon him as he walked
[54:53] up to the hill called Calvary. Amen. But
[54:55] here here this little boy is looking at
[54:57] this and he's saying, you know, I I see
[55:00] the wood. I see the fire, but where is
[55:03] the sacrifice? And Abraham called those
[55:06] things as not that were not as though
[55:08] they were. He said, "Listen, I I'm not
[55:11] going to dwell on that. All I know is
[55:12] God is going to provide for himself a
[55:15] sacrifice." Amen. And where faith begin
[55:18] to speak, and as long as you have the
[55:21] promise of God that says it, regardless
[55:23] what circumstance looks like, believe it
[55:27] anyhow, for God said so. Amen. So if God
[55:32] has promises in here and and I I want to
[55:34] bring back again, if God has promises in
[55:37] here, Amen, of your children being
[55:39] saved,
[55:41] he does. He has promises in here. Amen.
[55:44] What you got to do is begin to confess
[55:47] before it even happens
[55:49] that I am the one in this situation and
[55:52] this promise is talking to me
[55:55] and God's going to provide this way.
[55:58] God's going to open up the way. I don't
[55:59] know how he's going to do it, but God
[56:02] will provide a sacrifice.
[56:07] So, and if you're children of Abraham,
[56:09] you know, not not a children of the
[56:10] church. Somebody asked me the other day
[56:13] and she'll probably listen to this. You
[56:14] know, she's wonder she she didn't
[56:16] understand why you have to sign. She
[56:18] asked if we have membership and I said,
[56:19] "No, I don't believe we don't believe in
[56:21] memberships." You know, as far as you
[56:23] signing a name on a piece of paper, that
[56:25] don't save nobody.
[56:28] You can have your name on every piece of
[56:29] paper in every church in mind in
[56:31] Louisiana and the United States. It
[56:33] doesn't matter. It won't save
[56:35] you. Amen. So we we can't you can't sign
[56:38] your way into this into into being
[56:41] saved. You know how you're saved? Amen.
[56:43] You repent.
[56:45] Amen. Which means turn from the sin.
[56:47] You're baptized in the name of the Lord
[56:49] Jesus Christ. And you receive the spirit
[56:51] of circumcision, the Holy Ghost.
[56:55] Amen. You're you're not you're not
[56:57] signing your way into a membership.
[56:59] You're not signing your way into a
[57:01] church. You're born into a church. Not
[57:04] born by natural birth, but born by a
[57:07] spiritual birth.
[57:09] Amen. So, uh, you know, we're not
[57:12] children of a church. We're not children
[57:14] of a denomination.
[57:16] We're children of Abraham who believes
[57:18] God promise regardless of what someone
[57:21] else or somebody or whatever would say
[57:23] about it or what circumstance
[57:24] circumstance say about it. We believe
[57:26] his promises are true no matter what.
[57:30] Amen. We find him that God told him, you
[57:33] know, to separate himself from all
[57:35] kindred and and walk among a strange
[57:37] people. This is
[57:39] repent. Separation begins to take place.
[57:43] Amen. to separate you from your first
[57:45] your first birth as far as what it
[57:47] brought the life that were it brought
[57:49] and all the things that were passed
[57:51] down. And God calls us to be a separated
[57:54] people.
[57:57] Amen. Anybody home this this morning?
[57:59] God calls us to be a separated people.
[58:04] Amen. Not a life living with
[58:07] sin or practicing sin, but a life, amen,
[58:11] broken and separated from sin. It
[58:14] doesn't mean you won't make a mistake,
[58:16] but when you make that mistake, there'll
[58:18] be something inside of you and say,
[58:19] "Hey, you done wrong and you'll make it
[58:21] right."
[58:25] So, we we find that God told him to
[58:27] separate himself from the kindred and
[58:29] and walk among a strange people and who
[58:32] spoke a strange language.
[58:34] And
[58:35] it yeah, some of y'all separated from
[58:39] your own kin and you started walking
[58:41] around walking with people who spoke
[58:43] strange languages because you know we
[58:45] got a whole language today that they
[58:47] didn't have 20 or 30 years ago and and
[58:50] naturally speaking now 20 or 30 years
[58:53] ago there was nothing called an iPhone.
[58:56] Go a little bit back further nothing
[58:57] called internet. Go a little bit further
[58:58] nothing called computers and all the
[59:00] stuff that goes with it. Definitely
[59:01] nothing called AI.
[59:05] Come
[59:07] on. Amen. And then when you come here,
[59:09] you come under begin to walk. Amen. In
[59:11] this message, you become to walk in a
[59:13] people who speaks a strange language.
[59:15] They no longer speak about three gods.
[59:17] They speak about one God. They no longer
[59:20] speak about, Amen. a God who used to or
[59:22] a God who used to do things, but a God
[59:25] who is the same yesterday, today, and
[59:27] forever.
[59:30] Amen. And they begin to speak about a
[59:31] God who sent a revelation in this day
[59:34] that opened the book and it broke the
[59:36] seals off. Amen. And it begins to speak
[59:38] about all of these things. What is it?
[59:40] It is a strange language to the
[59:42] worldmen,
[59:44] but it called you to walk with this. God
[59:46] calls for separation. When you became uh
[59:49] a Christian, you got to separate
[59:51] yourself from sinful associates.
[59:55] Amen. Otherwise, you get dragged right
[59:57] back. That's what he said. come out from
[59:58] among them my people and be you
[1:00:00] separate. It's a different walk. It's a
[1:00:03] different talk. It's a different life.
[1:00:05] Amen. It's a walk between you and God
[1:00:07] alone.
[1:00:10] Amen. Next thing we find that Abraham
[1:00:12] begins to get older and he gets all even
[1:00:15] after he's given the promise and and the
[1:00:17] promise looks further off and Sarah got
[1:00:19] older and you know Abraham maybe after
[1:00:21] 10 years had passed or you know 15 years
[1:00:24] maybe Abraham would go to Sarah say how
[1:00:25] do you feel? Uh, well, no different at
[1:00:27] all, Abraham. Well, praise God. We're
[1:00:29] going to have it anyhow. See, God has
[1:00:31] said it. So, that settles it. And the
[1:00:34] and a child of Abraham will have that
[1:00:36] same kind of
[1:00:39] faith. It doesn't matter what
[1:00:42] circumstances says. It doesn't matter if
[1:00:44] it's been two months, two years, 20
[1:00:46] years. It matters not. What matters is
[1:00:49] God said so.
[1:00:51] Amen. We get our we get our minds on
[1:00:53] stuff. Sometimes it doesn't even matter.
[1:00:55] That's not even part of the equation.
[1:00:57] Listen, time with God is not part of the
[1:01:00] equation.
[1:01:02] Amen. When God moves, he moves. And and
[1:01:05] he's not he's not held back by time.
[1:01:07] He's not a creature of time. Therefore,
[1:01:09] he's not worried about it if it's two
[1:01:10] months, two years, 20 years, 100 years.
[1:01:13] He could care less. God knows. He said
[1:01:16] it. It's going to come to pass. So, a
[1:01:18] child of Abraham will grab a hold of
[1:01:20] that word and say, "It doesn't matter
[1:01:22] how I feel. It doesn't matter what it
[1:01:24] looks like. It doesn't matter the
[1:01:26] circumstances. I believe it anyhow. God
[1:01:28] said it. It settles it.
[1:01:36] But he be, you know, he began to speak
[1:01:38] to the Lord. Lord, I I go childless. I
[1:01:40] have no children. There's one in my
[1:01:43] household that's this Ezra and he's from
[1:01:46] Damascus. Maybe he can take all my
[1:01:48] inheritance. God said, "That's not your
[1:01:50] heir. the one that's in your bowels, the
[1:01:52] one that's in your loins will be your
[1:01:54] heir. He said, "Lord, how will this be?"
[1:01:57] And God confirmed his covenant, his oath
[1:02:00] to Abraham. He told Abraham, said, "Go
[1:02:02] get me a heer and and a she goat and and
[1:02:05] a ram and some turtle doves and pigeons
[1:02:07] and and we know the story. He went and
[1:02:09] killed the animals and he cut them in
[1:02:11] two and laid them piece by piece. But
[1:02:13] the turtle doves, he did not separate.
[1:02:15] But those animals that were cut apart,
[1:02:17] he laid them out. And Abraham watched
[1:02:19] the fowls of the air as they started to
[1:02:21] come down to get on them. And Abraham
[1:02:23] drove them away into the going down of
[1:02:25] the sun. And as the sun went down, God
[1:02:28] caused a deep sleep to fall upon
[1:02:29] Abraham. And otherwise, Abraham, I'm
[1:02:32] just taking you out of the
[1:02:35] picture. Cuz this fulfillment of this
[1:02:37] promise is not about you. It's all about
[1:02:40] me.
[1:02:42] Amen. Sometimes it feels like you're
[1:02:44] swatting off the fowls of the air and
[1:02:46] the thoughts of of Satan as he tries to
[1:02:48] come and tell you, "It's not for you.
[1:02:50] It's not for you. It's not for you." But
[1:02:53] God will bring you to a place till you
[1:02:55] realize it's not about you. It's about
[1:02:58] what God's already done. And all you got
[1:03:01] to do is say, "God, I believe." Amen.
[1:03:07] Sun went
[1:03:09] down, put him in a deep sleep, and
[1:03:12] Abraham went to sleep. The first thing
[1:03:13] he saw was this great darkness and
[1:03:16] horror representing death. Every man
[1:03:19] that's born on earth must meet
[1:03:21] death. And to be born again, you must
[1:03:24] meet
[1:03:25] death. Amen. Death to yourself. He saw a
[1:03:28] smoking furnace. Every man, you know,
[1:03:30] was deserving of hell. We were all born
[1:03:33] in sin, shaped in iniquity, come this
[1:03:35] world speaking lies. There's nothing
[1:03:37] good about us to begin with. Death comes
[1:03:41] and hell was next. But then all of a
[1:03:44] sudden, he saw a burning
[1:03:46] light. Hallelujah. A light. This lamp
[1:03:49] went between each one of those pieces,
[1:03:51] making a covenant that God someday
[1:03:54] through his promised seed will raise up
[1:03:56] the Lord Jesus Christ to confirm the
[1:03:58] covenant to all peoples of the earth
[1:04:00] which Abraham was a father of nations.
[1:04:02] And he changed his name after that from
[1:04:05] Abraham. Abram to Abraham. What was it?
[1:04:08] Amen. Was unconditional covenant. But in
[1:04:11] that it changed who Abraham was.
[1:04:16] Hallelujah. Amen. That's the only reason
[1:04:18] why you can know that you're under the
[1:04:20] same covenant is you have been changed.
[1:04:25] You're not the same person. This is what
[1:04:27] we we we referred to it a while ago, but
[1:04:29] I read the scripture Hebrews 6 and verse
[1:04:32] 13. For when God made the promise to
[1:04:34] Abraham, because he could swear by no
[1:04:36] greater, he swore by himself. He could
[1:04:38] have swore by the trees. He could have
[1:04:40] swore by the sun. He could have swore by
[1:04:42] the earth. He could have swore by man.
[1:04:44] But there was nobody greater to swear by
[1:04:46] than by himself. He said, I'm making
[1:04:49] this promise and this promise is on
[1:04:52] me. Hallelujah. Surely blessing I will
[1:04:56] bless thee and multiply and I will
[1:04:57] multiply thee. So that after he
[1:05:00] patiently endured, he obtained the
[1:05:03] promise. Amen. There was a part Abraham
[1:05:05] did have to play. He had to stay right
[1:05:08] there upon the promise. Stand right
[1:05:10] there upon the word, not moving from it.
[1:05:13] I I'm committed it to God. It's
[1:05:15] finished. God said so. And I'm going to
[1:05:18] stand here until God bringeth it to
[1:05:20] pass. Amen. That's where a true sigh
[1:05:22] child of Abraham is. We're not standing
[1:05:25] upon our feelings. We're not standing
[1:05:26] upon what somebody says. We're standing
[1:05:29] upon what God has spoken in this hour.
[1:05:32] That's why we're still That's why there
[1:05:33] will be a people that shall remain
[1:05:38] cuz they're not standing upon their own
[1:05:40] thoughts or their own abilities or what
[1:05:42] they think or how they think is going to
[1:05:43] happen. All I know is he said there will
[1:05:46] be someone that's alive and they will
[1:05:48] remain.
[1:05:50] So we stand upon the word of God. This
[1:05:54] covenant is unconditional but it comes
[1:05:58] with a name change. And this is what we
[1:06:01] saw happen in this very hour that we're
[1:06:03] living in under the message. I mean, the
[1:06:06] covenant that was given to the bride of
[1:06:07] Jesus Christ. We can see it in the first
[1:06:10] seal. Amen. How that he he he said it
[1:06:12] would be known the last days. It would
[1:06:14] come forth as a in a church symbol. Do
[1:06:16] you understand it, church? He said it
[1:06:18] comes forth in the symbol of a church.
[1:06:21] They knew there there is a seal, but
[1:06:23] just what yet they didn't know because
[1:06:24] it's a white horse rider. And only to be
[1:06:27] revealed at the last day when this seal
[1:06:29] is broken. broken to who? Not the
[1:06:32] Christ, but the church. Oh my, that
[1:06:34] makes me tremble. I hope that the tri
[1:06:36] church truly understand this what I
[1:06:38] mean. You
[1:06:39] people, come on. You people, I'm going
[1:06:43] to call you bride.
[1:06:48] Hallelujah. Not just the church world,
[1:06:50] but brother Brandon begin to realize
[1:06:52] there was a there was a seed came forth.
[1:06:55] It came into what looked like a seed,
[1:06:56] but just around that seed was a husk.
[1:07:01] And it begin to pull away and reveal the
[1:07:03] true original grain again. And he said,
[1:07:06] "I'll no longer call you church. I'm
[1:07:08] going to call you bride." Do you
[1:07:10] understand what this message is really
[1:07:12] is? It's not a message of rules and
[1:07:14] regulation. It is a message of grace.
[1:07:18] It came down saying, "Grace, grace."
[1:07:20] Amen. The faithful creator has broke the
[1:07:23] seals and revealed the power of Christ
[1:07:26] in this day to bring a bride out of a
[1:07:28] church just like he brought Abraham out
[1:07:31] of his
[1:07:33] family, a people for his name's
[1:07:38] sake. I no longer call you church, but I
[1:07:41] call you bride. I no longer call you
[1:07:44] lost.
[1:07:47] I no longer call you a wonderer. I no
[1:07:50] longer call you a slave. I call you a
[1:07:52] son or daughter of the most high God.
[1:07:59] You know in
[1:08:00] America when we make a covenant for
[1:08:03] years it was made on a handshake. People
[1:08:06] were honest people back then
[1:08:09] apparently. Amen. You know people here
[1:08:12] he says who belong in business realms.
[1:08:14] You call your friend out and have a
[1:08:16] sandwich, drink a cup of coffee, and
[1:08:18] talk things over and make an agreement.
[1:08:20] You reach out and get a hold of the
[1:08:21] friend's hand and shake his hand, say
[1:08:23] it's agreeable. That's a covenant. You
[1:08:25] shook one another's hand on it. Shake on
[1:08:28] it. You've done that many times. I've
[1:08:30] done it. Shake on it. That's it. It's a
[1:08:32] sealed contract. When you shook your
[1:08:36] hand, come on,
[1:08:38] somebody. It ought to still be that
[1:08:41] way. Now, people's words don't don't
[1:08:43] mean very much. You know, even I I hate
[1:08:46] to say it, even quote unquote believers
[1:08:48] words sometimes don't mean much.
[1:08:50] Sometimes you can get in the worst deals
[1:08:52] of your life with a believer.
[1:08:55] I know that hurts, but that's the truth.
[1:08:58] You know why? Because they ain't born
[1:08:59] again.
[1:09:02] Cuz if they was born again, they would
[1:09:03] obey according to the rules of God.
[1:09:06] And if they made a covenant with
[1:09:08] somebody or said they was going to do
[1:09:09] something, they would do everything they
[1:09:11] could to bring it to pass. And if they
[1:09:13] couldn't, they would go to that person
[1:09:14] and say, "Hey, this is a reason why I
[1:09:16] haven't. I'm sorry. I said I was going
[1:09:18] to do, but I I can't bring it. I can't
[1:09:20] do it." Cuz I know men, we are men. We
[1:09:22] are limited. We We have limited
[1:09:24] abilities. Sometimes we make promises
[1:09:26] that we can't keep. But if we've made a
[1:09:28] promise, we ought to make sure we do
[1:09:30] everything to fulfill that promise.
[1:09:40] back in the, you know, back in the time
[1:09:42] of the Lord Jesus when he came time of
[1:09:45] Abraham before they would take a piece
[1:09:47] of paper and they wrote whatever they
[1:09:49] made on their covenant about and they
[1:09:51] would rip it in half. And when they
[1:09:53] would rip it in half, they would bring
[1:09:56] this covenant back together. Each one
[1:09:59] had a piece of the covenant. might be a
[1:10:01] good thing for some people to go back
[1:10:02] to. Write it down on paper, tear it
[1:10:04] apart. You both got a copy of
[1:10:07] it because people get in some business
[1:10:09] deals. So, I don't even know why we're
[1:10:10] people getting in some business deals
[1:10:12] sometimes on a handshake and they get
[1:10:14] hard feelings and well, you know, they
[1:10:15] bring those hard feelings right back
[1:10:16] into
[1:10:18] church. Amen. It's time that we start we
[1:10:21] if we have to, if a handshake ain't good
[1:10:22] enough with somebody, but write it out
[1:10:24] on paper, tear it in half. Amen. That
[1:10:26] way, you got both of them. Or write two
[1:10:28] pieces. I don't care how you do it.
[1:10:30] Amen. But make sure you're both on the
[1:10:32] same page.
[1:10:35] Amen. But whatever you do, don't bring
[1:10:37] your hurts back into the house of God.
[1:10:41] Amen. Cuz you didn't make the deal in
[1:10:43] the house of God. You made it out there
[1:10:44] in your business. But when you come to
[1:10:46] the house of God, let all that stuff go
[1:10:48] and let it lay aside. But if you have
[1:10:51] done wrong, make it right.
[1:10:59] What? But this when they would come
[1:11:02] back, they would slay an animal and they
[1:11:04] would tear the piece in half and it
[1:11:06] would come
[1:11:07] back and they took an oath that if this
[1:11:10] covenant was broke, let their bodies be
[1:11:12] broke just like the dead animal was
[1:11:14] broke that was standing between
[1:11:17] them. Well, that would change a lot of
[1:11:19] deals, wouldn't it?
[1:11:22] Yeah, buddy. Let's put some skin in the
[1:11:24] game.
[1:11:27] What a beautiful picture though of
[1:11:28] Calvary. When God took Jesus up to
[1:11:30] Calvary there, he tore him apart. He
[1:11:32] raised his body and he put it back at
[1:11:35] the right hand on the throne. Sent back
[1:11:36] his spirit. He tore out of that body the
[1:11:39] Holy Ghost and he put it back to his
[1:11:41] church. And when we come
[1:11:44] together, come on, tore off the same
[1:11:47] page, his body united with the body upon
[1:11:50] the earth, it has to be a match.
[1:11:54] Come on. If you don't have the Holy
[1:11:56] Ghost, you're not going to match with
[1:11:58] that body.
[1:12:00] Amen. It has to be a match. And when we
[1:12:02] come together, this coveted people will
[1:12:04] have the same spirit. We'll have the
[1:12:06] same power. We'll have the same love.
[1:12:08] We'll have the same unity. Amen. that
[1:12:11] was in Jesus Christ, the individual,
[1:12:14] it'll also be in the body of
[1:12:18] Christ. But the contract that God made
[1:12:21] over the life of his own son to tear him
[1:12:23] apart, his spirit from his body, raised
[1:12:25] him up and sent back to the church, we
[1:12:27] got to be born again of the spirit or we
[1:12:30] are not in God's covenant.
[1:12:35] You can call it holy roller. You can
[1:12:37] call it whatever you want to. But it's
[1:12:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that puts
[1:12:41] you in covenant with God and seals you
[1:12:44] by the spirit of
[1:12:45] promise. Amen. That's why he said in
[1:12:47] Ephesians 4:30, "Grieve not the Holy
[1:12:49] Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed
[1:12:52] unto the day of your
[1:12:54] redemption." Amen. After that moment,
[1:12:57] Amen. And when he saw that it was an
[1:12:59] unconditional covenant, then Abraham
[1:13:01] would stand upon the word. And we must
[1:13:03] also, as we have seen and come and been
[1:13:06] sealed with that unconditional covenant,
[1:13:08] stand upon the word with God's word.
[1:13:10] Every amen, every jot, every tit, where
[1:13:13] are you standing at this morning? He
[1:13:14] said, I'm trying to tell you, pull away
[1:13:16] from the shucks. Get out here in the
[1:13:18] wheat where you can get right before the
[1:13:20] sun. Hear the coming of the combine.
[1:13:22] We're in harvest time. Amen. You're
[1:13:25] standing now though completely
[1:13:27] justified, though like you never done in
[1:13:29] the first place. He said, "Oh, I'm
[1:13:31] thankful of that more than that that
[1:13:32] than anything I know of. You're the
[1:13:34] pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son
[1:13:37] of the living God. Every man or woman
[1:13:40] that's born of the spirit of God and
[1:13:42] washed the blood in the blood of Jesus
[1:13:44] Christ and believes every word of God
[1:13:46] stands as though you never sinned at the
[1:13:49] first place. You are perfect. Amen.
[1:13:54] Shut up, devil. Amen. You are perfect.
[1:13:58] Why? Because you have a perfect
[1:14:00] sacrifice.
[1:14:04] He said, "If I was supposed to die in
[1:14:05] the morning, a man took my place. I
[1:14:07] can't die for that sin if somebody's
[1:14:09] already took my place.
[1:14:11] And Jesus, the word took my place. He
[1:14:15] became me a sinner that I might become
[1:14:17] him the word. Let me hold true to it.
[1:14:19] Not the church but to the word. He said
[1:14:22] that's the spiritual union of Christ in
[1:14:24] his church. Now when the flesh is
[1:14:26] becoming word and the word is becoming
[1:14:27] flesh, it manifests itself. It's
[1:14:30] vindicated just what the Bible said
[1:14:32] would happen. It's happening day by day.
[1:14:34] Why? It's accumulated so fast out on the
[1:14:37] desert. These things taking place. I
[1:14:38] couldn't even keep up with it. We are
[1:14:40] near the coming of Jesus to be reunited
[1:14:43] with his church where the word becomes
[1:14:45] the word. And the call of the Holy
[1:14:47] Spirit is now searching the hearts, but
[1:14:50] you are standing complete. Amen. You
[1:14:53] never sin in the first place. God don't
[1:14:56] even know about it.
[1:14:58] Woo. You're talking about a faith and a
[1:15:00] faithful creator. A creator that could
[1:15:02] create such a blood that would come over
[1:15:05] your sin and totally annihilate it to
[1:15:08] where you don't God doesn't even know
[1:15:10] about it no more. Amen. You never did
[1:15:13] it. You were accused of it by the
[1:15:15] accuser. But really from the beginning
[1:15:17] you were a predestinated to be a son or
[1:15:19] daughter of God. You're now standing
[1:15:20] washed. The old book of divorcement is
[1:15:23] put away. It's dead. It's absolutely out
[1:15:25] of existence. Even the mind of God. You
[1:15:28] are the virtuous bride of Christ. Washed
[1:15:30] in the blood of Christ. Oh God, what
[1:15:32] kind of service can we have this morning
[1:15:34] when you realize that all my past is
[1:15:37] completely out of the mind of God? He's
[1:15:39] not even concerned about it this
[1:15:41] morning. He's not even got one thought
[1:15:43] about it this morning. It's gone.
[1:15:48] You're washed. You're the virtuous bride
[1:15:51] of Christ. Washed in the blood of
[1:15:52] Christ. Precious, virtuous, sinless son
[1:15:54] of God. Standing with a pure unad
[1:15:57] adulterated bride word that he washed by
[1:16:00] the water of his own blood and became
[1:16:02] flesh and manifest that he might take
[1:16:04] you which are were predestinated in the
[1:16:06] bosom of the father before the beginning
[1:16:08] the same as he was.
[1:16:11] He Hello.
[1:16:15] Don't just gloss over it now. That he
[1:16:18] might take you which were predestinated
[1:16:21] in the bosom of the father before the
[1:16:23] beginning the same as he
[1:16:28] was. Do you see where you're standing
[1:16:30] this morning?
[1:16:33] Some people like, you know, to be in the
[1:16:35] right standings, you know, and have
[1:16:37] certain standings or or things in their
[1:16:40] life, you know,
[1:16:41] standards,
[1:16:43] right? Standard of
[1:16:45] living, standard of a car, standard of a
[1:16:48] house, standard of a job. That's all
[1:16:53] temporary. Because today you can have
[1:16:54] one standard and tomorrow it'd be gone.
[1:16:58] or today where your standard might be
[1:16:59] down here and God open up a door and
[1:17:01] your standard come back up here. But
[1:17:04] forget all of those. That's not the
[1:17:05] standard we're talking about. Where
[1:17:07] you're standing, the standard where
[1:17:09] you're at. You were there at the
[1:17:12] beginning the same as he was.
[1:17:18] That's mind-blowing. The same is y'all
[1:17:21] y'all sleeping. What's happening? the
[1:17:23] same as not the same as some ball star
[1:17:26] or this
[1:17:29] not the same as some movie star or but
[1:17:32] the same as the morning star
[1:17:35] in the same standing as he
[1:17:39] was. What freedom we got this morning.
[1:17:43] What joy we ought to have in our hearts.
[1:17:48] Amen. When you realize I'm not standing
[1:17:51] upon my own morals. I'm not standing.
[1:17:53] Amen. I'm not My standard is not whether
[1:17:56] I've done right today or I've done wrong
[1:17:57] tomorrow or done wrong this morning.
[1:17:59] That's not my stand. That's not where
[1:18:01] I'm standing. I'm standing at the same
[1:18:03] place he was.
[1:18:08] Glory to God. I can't nail that home
[1:18:10] enough to Amen. Did you can realize
[1:18:12] where you are standing this morning.
[1:18:14] You're not standing up on your own
[1:18:16] abilities. You're not standing on the
[1:18:18] ability of this church.
[1:18:21] That's not where you're standing. You're
[1:18:23] standing at the same place he
[1:18:35] was. power to all the ransom church of
[1:18:39] God be saved to sin no more. What is
[1:18:42] sin? Well, I tell you, I' done this
[1:18:45] wrong and I got to smoke and drink. No,
[1:18:46] sin is
[1:18:48] unbelief. You smoke and drink because
[1:18:50] you don't believe his word.
[1:18:52] You live ungodly lives. You live for in
[1:18:55] a fornication because you don't believe
[1:18:56] his word.
[1:19:02] Good lance. Some of the stuff you can
[1:19:04] see sometimes
[1:19:06] just blows your mind. We got not message
[1:19:10] preachers, thank God, but preachers
[1:19:12] getting up trying to say that
[1:19:14] fornication is not a sin.
[1:19:16] Preaching it from pull pits. What? It's
[1:19:20] in the Bible.
[1:19:24] Who are you and what' you do with God?
[1:19:29] Amen. Because God's word is the same
[1:19:31] yesterday, today, and forever. I know
[1:19:33] this I know this age that we're living
[1:19:35] in. It ain't the same as it was even
[1:19:36] five years ago.
[1:19:39] Hey man, think about how much we've
[1:19:40] changed in just five
[1:19:42] years. Thoughts and thinking and I I was
[1:19:45] talking we was talking about something
[1:19:46] the other day. I how when I was a kid I
[1:19:49] I used to get up in the morning Daniel
[1:19:51] and Matthew Puit live right with double
[1:19:53] first cousins like brothers and we just
[1:19:55] be out in the woods all day. Didn't have
[1:19:57] no cell phones. There was just as many
[1:19:59] snakes then as there was now.
[1:20:04] Come on. Many just as many ponds to
[1:20:06] drown in as there is now. We'd be out in
[1:20:09] the woods all day and and and dad he
[1:20:11] would finally he put up this big old
[1:20:12] bell in the front of our house and he'd
[1:20:14] ring that dude about three times. I knew
[1:20:16] I better be heading to the
[1:20:17] house and if I used to be a horn, he'd
[1:20:20] honk three times in the bell. But
[1:20:22] whatever I but I'd be out there all day
[1:20:24] building forts, playing cowboys and
[1:20:26] Indians, whatever we was doing, having a
[1:20:28] good time. Wasn't thinking about
[1:20:29] nothing. And our parents apparently
[1:20:30] wouldn't worried about us either. But
[1:20:32] now we we we can't find our kids and
[1:20:34] they won't answer their cell phone. One
[1:20:35] moment we thought, man, they done
[1:20:38] died. Somebody done grabbed them,
[1:20:40] kidnapped them. All kind of thought.
[1:20:43] Things have changed.
[1:20:46] This world is constantly changing.
[1:20:50] The attitude towards sin is constantly
[1:20:52] changing. Amen. 100 years ago, you'd
[1:20:55] never be out talking about a
[1:20:56] homosexuality the way it's prevalent
[1:20:58] today and all the things that are coming
[1:21:00] out and the transgenders that's taking
[1:21:02] over win sports and all. You wouldn't be
[1:21:04] thinking about that. Matter of fact, if
[1:21:06] somebody was come out, Amen, and not be
[1:21:09] clothed right, they would think they was
[1:21:10] they would classify them all right. They
[1:21:12] classify them as insane.
[1:21:16] But everything has changed.
[1:21:20] And even from five years ago, how much
[1:21:22] more fear we have now. How much more
[1:21:24] dread and then and of course and I'm not
[1:21:27] even talking about the political part.
[1:21:28] Amen. Russia and all the stuff that's
[1:21:30] going on. Amen. But how much more is
[1:21:33] taking
[1:21:33] place and to where now men can dress
[1:21:36] like women and women dress like men.
[1:21:39] Well, guess what? They've been doing
[1:21:40] that for a long time and now we don't
[1:21:42] think nothing about
[1:21:43] it, right?
[1:21:46] We don't think about her being a
[1:21:49] crossdresser, but when a man comes in
[1:21:51] Walmart with a skirt on and some pink
[1:21:53] fingernails and pink whatever, oh,
[1:21:55] that's makes us sick to our stomach. But
[1:21:57] we've been in the water long enough that
[1:21:58] a woman can walk in pants, cut off hair
[1:22:00] up to We don't think nothing about it.
[1:22:02] How long is it going to be before we see
[1:22:04] people like that and we don't think
[1:22:05] nothing? It's happening already.
[1:22:09] Come on. This is where we're at. But God
[1:22:13] doesn't change.
[1:22:15] what he thought about sin a million
[1:22:17] years ago, he still thinks about it
[1:22:19] today the same way. So if his word
[1:22:23] declares it to be sin, it's sin.
[1:22:30] But what is it's unbelief in God which
[1:22:32] is the word. Amen. Pure, unadulterated.
[1:22:35] But we are now pure, unadulterated,
[1:22:37] leaving soon for the sky, standing
[1:22:39] ready. Think your garments washed by the
[1:22:41] water of the bleeding word. The word
[1:22:43] became blood. The word bled for you.
[1:22:46] You're washed in the bleeding word. The
[1:22:48] bleeding word. The word bleeding. The
[1:22:50] life of God is now in the word. And the
[1:22:53] word bled from you that you might be
[1:22:55] washed from the filth of these
[1:22:57] prostitutes and be cleaned and
[1:22:59] sanctified by the cleansing of the water
[1:23:01] of the word. That makes your heart and
[1:23:03] mind stayed on God and his word. Now,
[1:23:05] how do you know it's true? When God
[1:23:07] comes down and vindicates it and prove
[1:23:09] it, you say, "Well, I don't I don't
[1:23:11] believe it that way." They didn't
[1:23:12] believe it in Jesus' way. They didn't,
[1:23:14] but God proved it. They didn't believe
[1:23:15] it in Noah's way, but God proved it.
[1:23:17] They didn't believe Moses' way, but God
[1:23:19] proved it. Amen. They were willing to
[1:23:21] take Balam's word for it, but God proved
[1:23:24] he was the same yesterday, today, and
[1:23:26] forever.
[1:23:31] Separate yourself, the Bible says, from
[1:23:36] unbelief. Hallelujah.
[1:23:39] But we're going to a wedding in the sky.
[1:23:47] Well, I tell you what, if you ain't play
[1:23:48] you ain't planning on going, you just go
[1:23:51] ahead and stay quiet. But I'm
[1:23:57] going. Amen. I am going to a wedding.
[1:24:02] There's been a banquet prepared for me
[1:24:04] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:24:06] I've said it before. Lord been said many
[1:24:08] times, he's got plates lying down and he
[1:24:10] ain't got one extra plate or not one
[1:24:13] plate not enough. Amen. He knows exactly
[1:24:15] the names that are written. Amen. I
[1:24:17] think about it. Amen. You even plan a
[1:24:19] banquet. I've seen it happen. You know,
[1:24:21] Sister Linda puts a little name tags
[1:24:23] there and puts plates out and some
[1:24:25] people come, some people don't. Even
[1:24:28] after they paid their fees or after
[1:24:29] whatever and they don't show up and so
[1:24:31] she put a name and a plate there and we
[1:24:33] got extra plates or there's times
[1:24:34] somebody comes and they didn't say they
[1:24:36] was coming. So you had to pull out an
[1:24:37] extra plate. But God by his fornowledge
[1:24:40] knows who's going to be there.
[1:24:43] He don't plan banquetss like we plan
[1:24:45] banquetss. He's going to have just
[1:24:46] enough food. He going to have just
[1:24:48] enough seats. He going to have just
[1:24:50] enough power, just enough of glory. He
[1:24:53] going to have just enough to wipe every
[1:24:54] tear from our eye. He going to be He
[1:24:56] going to be He's the great master and
[1:24:58] creator. He knows exactly how much to
[1:25:01] place there.
[1:25:03] Hallelujah. and my seat will not be
[1:25:05] missing.
[1:25:12] We're wearing the wedding band of
[1:25:14] predestinated unmarited grace.
[1:25:19] That's why I'm trying to say this
[1:25:20] message, this covenant is not a covenant
[1:25:23] of laws.
[1:25:25] It's a covenant of
[1:25:28] grace. People wants to say this message
[1:25:30] ain't nothing but a bunch of laws and
[1:25:31] regulation. No. If you get the same
[1:25:33] spirit, you recognize it's nothing but
[1:25:36] grace.
[1:25:37] That God, rich in mercy, saw me in my
[1:25:40] slop.
[1:25:41] He saw me where I was down and to and
[1:25:44] and in a slop pit. And he saw me where I
[1:25:47] didn't have no hope. He saw me where it
[1:25:49] was impossible for me to make it out of
[1:25:51] that thing on my own. But God reaching
[1:25:53] mercy. Thank God his hand could reach
[1:25:55] further down than I could ever get. and
[1:25:58] he reached down in the pit and he picked
[1:26:00] me up and he put me in the same standing
[1:26:06] and he slipped a band of unmmerited
[1:26:09] grace upon my finger. God did it
[1:26:12] himself.
[1:26:14] God did it himself. He knew you before
[1:26:16] the foundation of the world. So he
[1:26:18] slipped the wedding band on you there
[1:26:20] and put your name on the book there.
[1:26:25] God have mercy. And he's a faithful
[1:26:28] creator. So he knew what he had to
[1:26:30] create to get you here where you are.
[1:26:35] You following me now? He knew the right
[1:26:37] amount of pressure to create in your
[1:26:39] life. He knew the rate. Oh, come on,
[1:26:41] somebody. That's exactly how it is with
[1:26:43] a diamond down there on the earth down
[1:26:45] and it's the pressure that's pushed
[1:26:47] against that piece of mineral that
[1:26:49] produces that diamond. Amen. What is it?
[1:26:51] God knows exactly what he had to create
[1:26:54] to get you where you need to be. He knew
[1:26:57] how much trouble to put upon you. He
[1:26:59] knew no matter how sorrow or what joy or
[1:27:01] what grace, whatever he had to do, he
[1:27:03] knew exactly what he had to do to get
[1:27:06] you right to this place. Not to this
[1:27:08] church, but to this word of unmmerited
[1:27:11] grace and favor of almighty God.
[1:27:15] Listen, if you've only come here for
[1:27:17] this church, you come for the wrong
[1:27:18] reason.
[1:27:20] Come on, somebody. If you only come here
[1:27:23] for evening light tabernacle, you came
[1:27:25] here for the wrong reason. I understand.
[1:27:26] Amen. I appreciate the atmosphere. I
[1:27:29] love the music. I love the songs. I love
[1:27:31] the worship. I love the freedom. Amen.
[1:27:33] But it's more than that. There's a word
[1:27:35] that's being moved among us. And it's
[1:27:38] the words of unmmerited grace and
[1:27:40] almighty God. And his favor has been
[1:27:42] placed upon you. Amen.
[1:27:47] So I ain't seeing it come to pass. I'm
[1:27:50] not seeing things happening. Well,
[1:27:52] Abraham didn't see it for a long time
[1:27:54] either, 20 some 25 years. But brother
[1:27:57] Brandon would bring it out about El
[1:27:59] Shadi, the almighty God, the breasted
[1:28:02] one. Amen. El Shadi, the bosom. Abraham,
[1:28:07] you're 100 years old. Sarah's 90. But I
[1:28:10] am the breasted God. Amen. uh he w he
[1:28:14] was wounded for our transgressions. With
[1:28:16] his stripes, we're healed. There's
[1:28:18] there's there's nutrients to be drawn
[1:28:19] from that. He said, Abraham, though
[1:28:22] you're old and your strength is gone,
[1:28:23] Sarah's womb is dead. The milk veins are
[1:28:26] gone. I'm the breast of God. Just lean
[1:28:28] on me. Nurse from my
[1:28:31] promises. Come on. What have you been
[1:28:33] what have you been getting strength
[1:28:34] from? Amen. Have you been getting
[1:28:36] strength from the word of God? Hey,
[1:28:39] strength from the tapes and strength
[1:28:41] from the message of the hour. Strength.
[1:28:43] Amen. God providing, God moving. In
[1:28:46] other words, like a fattened baby, a
[1:28:47] little baby can be weak and run down and
[1:28:49] crying and the mother can pick it up and
[1:28:51] bring it to her bosom. Not only is a
[1:28:53] little baby nursing the mother's tree,
[1:28:55] but you are now nursing on God's
[1:28:58] promises. You're nursing his strength.
[1:29:01] His word is his strength. I believe
[1:29:04] Jesus saves and the blood washes white
[1:29:06] and snow. I can. I will. I do believe
[1:29:09] you're nursing from his strength.
[1:29:12] This is exactly what May Mariah Puit
[1:29:14] did. Amen. When she she was there
[1:29:17] bald-headed from Alipcia and she got up
[1:29:19] one morning, she heard the words, "I
[1:29:21] can, I will, I do believe." What was it?
[1:29:23] She grabbed a hold of that and she began
[1:29:25] to nurse strength from it and she put it
[1:29:29] down on paper and pinned it to her wall.
[1:29:31] Listen, it's time some of you start
[1:29:33] doing that.
[1:29:35] Come on, somebody. I ain't talking about
[1:29:38] maybe having verses pinned all over your
[1:29:39] house. Why don't you start pinning them
[1:29:41] all over your heart and saying I can, I
[1:29:45] will, I do believe. This is the power of
[1:29:48] God. This is the grace of God that has
[1:29:50] been extended by a faithful
[1:29:55] creator. A real child of Abraham born
[1:29:58] again of the spirit of God is satisfied
[1:30:00] that God is going to keep his word while
[1:30:04] he is waiting on the strength.
[1:30:08] Hallelujah. Sometimes you don't feel
[1:30:10] very strong. Just keep nursing from the
[1:30:13] promises of God. Keep pulling from them.
[1:30:16] You don't have to fret. You don't have
[1:30:18] to just waller around and cry and
[1:30:20] scream. No, you're lay there and draw a
[1:30:24] little way back there and a little over
[1:30:26] here and some over in this book and some
[1:30:28] over in that book. Drawing strength. We
[1:30:31] are God's children that lean upon his
[1:30:33] promise. We're drawing our strength from
[1:30:37] God. If you're
[1:30:39] weak, you can't give up this and you
[1:30:41] can't give up that. Just take God's
[1:30:43] promise and draw from
[1:30:46] it. Pretty soon you'll draw in enough.
[1:30:49] It'll give you enough strength the
[1:30:51] cigarettes will fall
[1:30:54] off. We saw it happen how many times
[1:30:56] here? Well, let me just ask. How many
[1:30:58] have been delivered of
[1:31:00] cigarettes all over the
[1:31:03] building? Amen. Sin, things that held
[1:31:06] and you couldn't do it on your own. But
[1:31:08] God rich in mercy and you're plugged
[1:31:12] into a
[1:31:13] promise. Come on. That's what we got.
[1:31:16] People are plugged into all kinds of
[1:31:17] things today. Why don't we plug into
[1:31:19] promises?
[1:31:21] Amen. If you're weak, start plugging
[1:31:23] into a promise. Abraham, you're 100
[1:31:25] years old, but I'm just going to let you
[1:31:27] draw and nurse your way back to health
[1:31:29] again. What a beautiful promise. And
[1:31:31] here they are, 90 years old, 100 years
[1:31:33] old, and they're sitting out in the
[1:31:36] tent, but they're in the will of
[1:31:39] God. Sitting out in a tent, but in the
[1:31:43] will of God. Brother Brandham said, "I'd
[1:31:45] rather sit in a tent anytime and be in
[1:31:47] the will of God than sit in a mansion
[1:31:49] and be out of it."
[1:31:53] No matter where where it's at, as long
[1:31:56] as you're in the will of
[1:31:57] God, I'd rather sit in a tent anytime
[1:32:01] and be in the will of God. Abraham's
[1:32:03] sitting there
[1:32:05] nursing, drawing from God's eternal
[1:32:07] promise. And while he's resting and and
[1:32:11] in anticipation, expecting, all of a
[1:32:14] sudden, come walking down that dusty
[1:32:16] road came three men, dust on their
[1:32:20] clothes. And because Abraham was plugged
[1:32:22] in, he recognized who they were.
[1:32:28] He ran into his tent. He said, "Hey,
[1:32:30] Sarah, stop what you're doing. We got
[1:32:33] somebody coming. Won't you get He tells
[1:32:36] his servant, "Get a calf. S get it.
[1:32:38] Let's make a calf sandwich. Let's get
[1:32:39] some milk. Let's get some butter and
[1:32:41] let's set it out. Let's entertain." He
[1:32:43] said, "Sometimes people entertain
[1:32:45] strangers un unknowingly. Sometimes that
[1:32:47] they're entertaining angels unaware. And
[1:32:50] here they are. But because he's plugged
[1:32:52] in and he's drawing from God. Amen. We
[1:32:54] saw it later. Amen. And a a man called
[1:32:56] Lot. Lot was plugged into
[1:32:59] Sodom. Hello. He was plugged in so much
[1:33:02] he became the mayor. He became a Hecame
[1:33:05] overseer. He he became a man lifted up
[1:33:07] and he's so plugged in what's going on
[1:33:09] and all the things that are happening.
[1:33:11] What's going on? And two men knock on
[1:33:12] their door and he don't even recognize
[1:33:14] who they are.
[1:33:16] They blind people and he still don't
[1:33:18] recognize who they
[1:33:20] are. Why? Because he was plugged into
[1:33:23] the wrong
[1:33:27] thing. Abraham talking to God. These two
[1:33:37] angels. He begins to speak to us. I'm
[1:33:40] going to visit
[1:33:41] you and Sarah's going to have a baby.
[1:33:44] And we know the story. Sarah's in the
[1:33:46] tent behind him. And she laughs in her
[1:33:49] heart. I'm 90 years
[1:33:51] old. Why did Sarah
[1:33:55] laugh? Sarah, I I didn't laugh. Yes, you
[1:34:00] did. You laughed. But I'm going to visit
[1:34:02] you and I'm going to confirm my promise.
[1:34:05] I'm going to bring forth my promise.
[1:34:09] If you read the scripture, this was
[1:34:11] really the first time that God revealed
[1:34:13] to Sarah herself that she was in the
[1:34:16] promise because she she she had tried to
[1:34:19] put it on that Hagar and tried to bring
[1:34:21] a deal. Well, this is the way it's going
[1:34:22] to happen. And she she tried to do it on
[1:34:24] her own because she didn't believe she
[1:34:26] couldn't believe it could be her. But
[1:34:28] then God came down said it's you. Do you
[1:34:32] remember that when he first came to you
[1:34:34] almost me? How could I do that? How
[1:34:38] could I be the one that God has chosen?
[1:34:40] How can I be a Christian? How can I live
[1:34:42] this overcoming life? It ain't how you
[1:34:45] can, it's how he's already done it.
[1:34:50] And here she is and she's
[1:34:53] laughing. And God would have struck her
[1:34:56] down, but he
[1:34:58] couldn't cuz she was part of the
[1:35:01] promise. And how many times God would
[1:35:04] have just said, "Forget, forget it. I've
[1:35:06] had enough.
[1:35:07] over us and our our our our friv p f p f
[1:35:10] p f p f p f p f p f p f p f p frivulty
[1:35:11] frivleness and all the stuff that we do
[1:35:13] sometime and God can just say I've got
[1:35:15] enough but he can't cuz you were part of
[1:35:17] the promise.
[1:35:19] He can't wipe you off cuz he's already
[1:35:22] got you in his unconditional
[1:35:26] covenant. God had to do
[1:35:28] something. This woman was 50 years past
[1:35:31] menopause. Absolutely childless. He was
[1:35:34] sterile.
[1:35:36] She was no way she could do it. No way.
[1:35:38] She was old enough to even bear the
[1:35:40] weight of the of a new or young enough
[1:35:42] or strong enough to bear the weight at
[1:35:44] 90 years old and much less go through
[1:35:47] labor. And here she was. He's going to
[1:35:49] have to strengthen her
[1:35:51] heart. You know, maybe patch her up a
[1:35:54] little bit, but that ain't the way God
[1:35:55] does
[1:35:57] things. You know what he done? He turned
[1:35:59] Abraham and Sarah back to a young man
[1:36:01] and woman again.
[1:36:04] It's one of the secrets of the Bible.
[1:36:05] Actually, you don't catch it sometimes
[1:36:07] what happened because this 90 year old
[1:36:10] year old woman, we know the story.
[1:36:12] Abraham would go down to a Greer and
[1:36:14] he'd go down there was aim down there, a
[1:36:16] king. And this king sees a 90 year old
[1:36:18] woman and says, "I want her for my
[1:36:22] wife." Well, there's a mystery in that.
[1:36:29] I don't mean to be crass or ugly right
[1:36:31] here, but there ain't no 90-year woman
[1:36:33] any young king wanted to
[1:36:36] marry.
[1:36:38] Why? He could have the most beautiful of
[1:36:41] the land. Oh, maybe that was what the
[1:36:43] case was. This 90 year old was somehow
[1:36:47] one of the most prettiest, beautiful
[1:36:48] women he ever saw in his
[1:36:51] life. I know we know it, but just for
[1:36:53] those that haven't heard it, here she
[1:36:55] is. and and he's Abraham said, "Wait a
[1:36:59] minute. Now, we got to tell them that
[1:37:00] we're brothers and
[1:37:01] sisters cuz he going to kill
[1:37:04] me." So, they make up this this this
[1:37:07] little story, you know, at 99% the
[1:37:10] truth. And he goes, she he takes her to
[1:37:13] be his wife. And that night, God comes
[1:37:14] to him and says, "You're nothing but a
[1:37:16] dead man." "Well, what have I done?" He
[1:37:18] was a a righteous man. He said, "What
[1:37:20] have I done? I I didn't know I'd done
[1:37:22] wrong." He said, "That's that man's
[1:37:24] wife." He said, "Lord, if id have known
[1:37:25] that, I He told me it was his sister. I
[1:37:27] I wouldn't have done that, Lord." He
[1:37:29] said, "Well, you to return her back or
[1:37:31] you're a dead
[1:37:32] man." A 90 year old
[1:37:37] woman. And here Abraham now, strong
[1:37:40] young
[1:37:43] man, God, the faithful
[1:37:47] creator, he had to bring the promise to
[1:37:50] pass. So he had to produce the way for
[1:37:53] it to come to pass because Abraham
[1:37:56] couldn't do it. Abraham couldn't take
[1:37:57] enough
[1:37:58] vitamins, enough
[1:38:02] oils, enough whatever, eat enough
[1:38:08] spinach. Sarah, she couldn't she
[1:38:10] couldn't do nothing on her own. She
[1:38:12] couldn't she couldn't eat enough
[1:38:13] vegetables. She couldn't eat take enough
[1:38:15] skin
[1:38:16] care to be able to produce this. So God,
[1:38:20] the faithful creator, had to bring the
[1:38:22] vehicle or the way for the promise to be
[1:38:25] fulfilled.
[1:38:27] Come on, 2,000y old Sarah. We've heard
[1:38:30] it preached here already. Amen. This
[1:38:32] 2,000-y old bride, amen, through seven
[1:38:35] dark church ages, amen, were dried up,
[1:38:38] amen, remnants of Christianity. But God
[1:38:41] said in his word, I will restore, sayeth
[1:38:43] the Lord.
[1:38:44] And so God sent the spirit again in this
[1:38:47] age that'll restore all the loose ends,
[1:38:50] all the broken truths, all the things,
[1:38:52] and bring the body back. Amen. To bring
[1:38:55] the son
[1:38:56] again. This is where we're at. It's the
[1:38:59] faithful
[1:39:01] creator. But then they have a son. And
[1:39:03] we go back to our scripture. Isaac about
[1:39:07] eight years old. this great trial
[1:39:14] come and here he is wondering you know
[1:39:18] his little curly-headed maybe Jewish boy
[1:39:21] mother and father had waited a long time
[1:39:23] and now God appeared to Abraham now to
[1:39:25] make sure to double promise you of his
[1:39:27] word whether you'll keep it or not and
[1:39:29] Abraham said Abraham this is the boy you
[1:39:32] know that's going to be a blessing to
[1:39:34] all the world but I want you to take
[1:39:35] this boy and take him out yonder to a
[1:39:37] place I'm going to show you. I'll show
[1:39:39] you and kill him for me. Did Abraham
[1:39:44] stagger? No. Matter of fact, the
[1:39:46] scripture we read said he got early up
[1:39:48] early the next morning. He didn't even
[1:39:50] drag
[1:39:52] around. Could you imagine if you've been
[1:39:54] told by God to go kill your son, how
[1:39:56] much you'd kind of maybe drag your feet
[1:39:57] like maybe by the time I wait it out a
[1:40:00] little bit, he'll change his mind.
[1:40:01] Abraham got up
[1:40:02] early. Three days journey.
[1:40:06] wasn't no little, you know, brother Ram
[1:40:08] said, we got gasoline feet now. You
[1:40:10] know, we we got gas that takes us
[1:40:12] everywhere. Three-day journey ain't that
[1:40:13] big a deal in a nice car. But he was
[1:40:16] walking. Do you know what kind of mind
[1:40:19] battles it tried to come in his mind?
[1:40:21] What kind of things tried to enter him,
[1:40:23] but inside of his heart, it just kept
[1:40:25] beating. God, you gave me the promise. I
[1:40:28] don't know how you're going to do this,
[1:40:30] but I know you're going to do it. You
[1:40:32] promised me that my seed shall come
[1:40:34] through Isaac. here. I tried to produce
[1:40:36] it on my own, God, and I made a mess of
[1:40:38] things, but you in your mercy, you came
[1:40:40] back around and you gave me this boy.
[1:40:42] And I know somehow I I'm going to go up
[1:40:44] in that mountain and I'm going to
[1:40:45] worship. And God, I got the I got the
[1:40:47] wood and I got the fire and I got little
[1:40:50] Isaac, but I know you're going to
[1:40:51] provide the sacrifice. And out of his
[1:40:54] mind and his thoughts as he was thinking
[1:40:56] upon this, it came out of his mouth. God
[1:40:59] will provide a sacrifice.
[1:41:03] And he lays him down. You're talking
[1:41:04] about
[1:41:06] faith. You wait here. But the lad now is
[1:41:10] going to
[1:41:11] return. How's he going to return when
[1:41:13] he's going to kill him? He said, "He
[1:41:15] received me. I've received him as one
[1:41:16] from the dead, knowing God could raise
[1:41:18] him from the dead." There you are. He
[1:41:20] didn't stagger about it. He believed
[1:41:21] God. And if we're children of Abraham,
[1:41:23] we're going to have the same kind of
[1:41:24] faith. Quit
[1:41:27] staggering. Don't stagger at the
[1:41:29] promises of God. If he said, "I'm the
[1:41:31] Lord God that heals thee all thy
[1:41:32] diseases." Walk in
[1:41:35] faith. I don't know exactly how it's
[1:41:37] going to be. I just know he made the
[1:41:38] promise. And he's going to He's a
[1:41:40] faithful creator. And he's going to
[1:41:42] create exactly what I have need of in my
[1:41:46] body. Come on, somebody. That's exactly
[1:41:49] what doctors are doing and scientists
[1:41:51] are trying to create what's lacking
[1:41:53] inside of a body. Amen. But God's such a
[1:41:55] perfect creator that he could create
[1:41:57] something that he gave or fed to Abraham
[1:41:59] and Isaac or Abraham and Sarah and it
[1:42:02] changed them back from a 190 to a young
[1:42:06] man and a young woman able to bring not
[1:42:08] only changed them back but changed their
[1:42:11] body
[1:42:12] to where she can now conceive who've
[1:42:14] been barren for it's 90
[1:42:17] years. What a secret laying inside of
[1:42:20] there that we've we have been re been
[1:42:22] revealed to us in this time. But here
[1:42:24] they
[1:42:27] are. I just say this. I
[1:42:30] remember meeting sister Ruth and brother
[1:42:33] Emil for the first time in in in in uh
[1:42:37] Tokyo there as we were just about to
[1:42:40] leave. Me and brother George Wyers,
[1:42:42] brother Craig was just about to get on a
[1:42:44] plane within a few hours and they had
[1:42:47] made a call for us to meet him at a
[1:42:49] Denny's. Please just want we want to we
[1:42:51] want to see you. we got we got to talk
[1:42:53] to you. And here they'd been searching
[1:42:55] time after time through every kind of
[1:42:57] denominational system serving time I
[1:42:59] believe in Ghana and places everywhere
[1:43:02] trying to find the truth. They come down
[1:43:04] and they sitting at our table there and
[1:43:06] brother Danny Delundo with us as well
[1:43:08] and and they're sitting there and and
[1:43:10] you know and just trying to fill them
[1:43:12] out and see where they're at and and
[1:43:14] things are going along pretty good and
[1:43:15] we hit things on the rapture and they
[1:43:17] said well that I remember brother Emil
[1:43:19] saying well that's the biggest uh lie or
[1:43:21] farce I've ever heard you know the
[1:43:22] rapture and right there we knew where we
[1:43:25] had to start and brother brother Craig
[1:43:27] begin to go into amen the Abraham and
[1:43:30] Sarah and I and Enoch and show amen the
[1:43:32] types of the rapture hidden written in
[1:43:34] the Old Testament and bringing it right
[1:43:36] through the New Testament. Amen. Their
[1:43:37] eyes begin to come open. Oh, God. God
[1:43:40] does that. Why? Amen. There was
[1:43:42] something on the inside of them. There
[1:43:44] was a there was a seed there and God had
[1:43:47] was a faithful creator and he created
[1:43:49] the right moment in the right place that
[1:43:51] that seed could come to life.
[1:44:00] Isaac said, "Well, here's the altar.
[1:44:02] Here's the fire. Well, where's the
[1:44:04] sacrifice? Where? Here's the wood.
[1:44:06] Where? Where? Wait a Where's the
[1:44:10] sacrifice? Abraham looking at his little
[1:44:13] boy. God will provide a
[1:44:16] lamb. He got everything ready and he
[1:44:18] takes his little son. He pulls his robes
[1:44:20] off and places him hands behind his back
[1:44:23] and he ties him, puts him up on the
[1:44:25] altar. No doubt holding tears back as it
[1:44:28] was choking down his throat, pulling his
[1:44:31] little hair back, reaching down, pulling
[1:44:33] out his knife. And and no doubt his
[1:44:36] heart was about to beat out of his
[1:44:37] chest. And all of a sudden, he hears a
[1:44:39] voice.
[1:44:40] Abraham, stay your hand. I see that you
[1:44:44] wouldn't even withhold your only
[1:44:45] begotten son. You wouldn't withhold him
[1:44:48] from me. What happened? A little ram
[1:44:50] begin to bleed. A ram. Amen. In the top
[1:44:52] of that mountain, a ram that had been
[1:44:55] there. No, he hadn't been there. He He'd
[1:44:56] have seen it right next to him caught in
[1:44:58] a bush. What was it? It was the faithful
[1:45:01] creator
[1:45:04] showing he's Jehovah Gyra. You say,
[1:45:07] "Well, that was a vision." It was not a
[1:45:08] vision. That lamb bled. That lamb died.
[1:45:15] Jehovah Gyra can provide for you
[1:45:18] tonight. If you're hungering and
[1:45:20] thirsting for you for something, there's
[1:45:21] something that he can provide that'll
[1:45:23] satisfy that thirst. Doctors try to give
[1:45:25] a medicine. Amen. To provide a way for
[1:45:28] healing. Some of it works. Some of it
[1:45:30] has side effects. But God has a way. He
[1:45:32] has a power. Amen. A pill. Amen. A a
[1:45:35] nutrient that that doctors can't tap
[1:45:38] into that'll go into a body and drive
[1:45:40] out cancer and drive out unbelief and
[1:45:43] drive out sin. He's a faithful creator.
[1:45:46] He can create it when there seems to be
[1:45:48] no
[1:45:50] way. You say, "Well, what about my son?
[1:45:52] What about my daughter?" Well, all I
[1:45:54] know he's a faithful creator.
[1:45:59] He's He's faithful enough to know how to
[1:46:01] orchestrate things, to set things
[1:46:03] exactly in order for them to be
[1:46:06] saved. How that is and when that is, I
[1:46:08] don't
[1:46:15] know. All I remember is we've told the
[1:46:19] story here about brother Justin. What
[1:46:21] was it? God was creating an atmosphere.
[1:46:25] He's a faithful creator.
[1:46:30] That's what he did. He created an
[1:46:32] atmosphere. It started earlier that day
[1:46:35] on a dozer right out here. Right out
[1:46:38] here pushing this little this dirt that
[1:46:40] was adding onto this other side of this
[1:46:41] building. Me and Brother Wayne
[1:46:43] feathering it off down to them poles
[1:46:45] down to that field. Adding it on that
[1:46:47] side. Hadn't been rain for months.
[1:46:50] wouldn't rain again for months after.
[1:46:52] But that one week that he could come
[1:46:53] started calling for rain. Now me in my
[1:46:57] human thoughts was not
[1:47:00] happy because I got brother Wayne here
[1:47:03] and he's only got a few days and God we
[1:47:06] don't need rain right now. But God had
[1:47:09] more ideas than some dirt. At least that
[1:47:12] dirt out there. He had some other dirt
[1:47:13] in mind.
[1:47:17] And here here I am fussing and and my
[1:47:19] own selfwar and then the dirt man quits
[1:47:21] me about noon and he don't show up and
[1:47:23] we still need about five loads and I'm
[1:47:24] calling him and Christianly way fussing
[1:47:32] him. I need some dirt, man. Where'd you
[1:47:35] go? Well, I had another job. We got
[1:47:36] rain. I know we got rain coming, but I
[1:47:38] got to have dirt. We done bought
[1:47:40] hundreds of loads from you. And you
[1:47:42] going to leave me? Oh, five loads. Come
[1:47:44] on. And I'll be back. I'll be Here he
[1:47:46] comes. And I'm watching right over here
[1:47:48] that building and building and building
[1:47:50] and building and building, not realizing
[1:47:53] it was God creating
[1:47:58] something. Not realizing that that storm
[1:48:01] was part of his
[1:48:03] plan.
[1:48:05] Hello. But in my own emotions, I didn't
[1:48:07] think so. I thought, "This ain't nothing
[1:48:09] but the devil doing this. He's trying to
[1:48:15] This is
[1:48:17] terrible. We're push that man finally
[1:48:20] brought that last load of dirt and
[1:48:21] brother Wayne pushes it down and smooths
[1:48:23] it all out and then the bottom falls
[1:48:24] out. We jump in the truck and I went ran
[1:48:27] and got the truck come picked him up on
[1:48:28] the dozer and we're wiping wet, you
[1:48:31] know, rain off of us. We're soaked and
[1:48:34] it's now Now listen, it's five o'clock
[1:48:36] on a Wednesday. Five o'clock on a
[1:48:39] Wednesday.
[1:48:40] 5:00 on a Wednesday. Brother Wayne's
[1:48:43] preaching at
[1:48:44] 7:30. He'd been on a dozer all day
[1:48:47] because we supposed to been by done by
[1:48:49] noon, but it, you know, was supposed to
[1:48:51] have been done by Tuesday. Supposed to
[1:48:52] have been done by
[1:48:55] Monday. You see what I'm saying? God's a
[1:48:58] faithful
[1:49:00] creator. He's working things for your
[1:49:03] good sometimes and you don't even know
[1:49:05] it. And you're like, "Well, that's just
[1:49:06] the devil." It could be God.
[1:49:11] Be careful what you call the devil
[1:49:12] sometimes. Cuz the devil's not in
[1:49:15] control of anything,
[1:49:18] not when it comes to your life. He's
[1:49:21] only allowed to move where God allows
[1:49:23] him to move.
[1:49:26] I jump in the I jump in the truck and I
[1:49:28] say, "Brother Wayne, look man, we got 45
[1:49:30] minutes back to the house. So we're
[1:49:31] almost 6:00 getting to the house. He got
[1:49:33] to be in the pull pit in an hour and a
[1:49:34] half. Get a shower, eat some food,
[1:49:36] whatever." Brother Wayne, I'm sorry, but
[1:49:39] the next the rest of your days was
[1:49:41] raining, so we had to get it done. He he
[1:49:43] looked over me with his little smile and
[1:49:44] he said, "Brother Timothy, don't don't
[1:49:46] even worry about it." I said, 'Oh, yeah.
[1:49:48] Why are you so
[1:49:49] calm? He said, "Well, about 2:00 today,
[1:49:52] the Lord fell down on a dozer and said,
[1:49:53] "I'm going to do something significant
[1:49:54] tonight, and I ain't worried about it."
[1:49:56] I said, "Brother Wayne, next time that
[1:49:58] happens, tell me about 20:05."
[1:50:07] He laughed. He said, 'I'm sorry. I
[1:50:08] should have I should have said
[1:50:10] something. He said, 'But brother brother
[1:50:11] Timothy, God's going to do something
[1:50:13] tonight. I don't know what it is, but
[1:50:14] God promised it.
[1:50:17] That was about the time my mother
[1:50:19] experienced her brain bleed and just
[1:50:20] back home suffering with that and had a
[1:50:22] lot of weakness in her body and dad
[1:50:24] would bring her to the to the back
[1:50:26] office that night believing and and that
[1:50:29] whole week, Brother Tim had already been
[1:50:31] confessing, God's going to do something.
[1:50:32] And God, I believe God's going to move.
[1:50:34] And I I believe God, we're going to have
[1:50:35] a a prayer line. It's going to be a lot
[1:50:37] of He's confessing. He's getting calls
[1:50:39] from another man up in Fort Smith who's
[1:50:40] needing deliverance. He said, "Come on.
[1:50:42] Come on. Wednesday night, we got
[1:50:43] deliverance. It's going to be there."
[1:50:45] He's confessing
[1:50:47] it. And here we are coming to that
[1:50:50] service and Brother Wayne preaching and
[1:50:51] all of a sudden, you can go back and
[1:50:53] listen. It changes. And and he begins to
[1:50:55] speak about God's deliverance. And when
[1:50:57] God wants to tear down walls, he'll tear
[1:50:59] them down. If God's got somebody behind
[1:51:01] them walls he want to save, God will
[1:51:03] tear down them walls at any moment
[1:51:06] cuz he's a faithful creator. Amen. He
[1:51:09] knew he had a Rahab behind some walls
[1:51:11] one day and God created a way for her to
[1:51:14] escape cuz he's a faithful creator. And
[1:51:17] here we are and he begins to preach and
[1:51:19] the power of God begins to fall. And we
[1:51:21] know how that how that service went for
[1:51:23] up to midnight over over past midnight.
[1:51:26] God moving and miracles taking place. I
[1:51:30] I just wonder I because we lose track
[1:51:32] sometimes of what all happened. I know
[1:51:33] brother uh little brother he was a
[1:51:35] little guy then. He's a lot bigger guy
[1:51:37] now. Jed Mitchell was healed of hundreds
[1:51:39] of warts on his body. The doctors had
[1:51:42] tried to take care of and they could
[1:51:44] only do so much but God supernaturally
[1:51:46] removed them. How many else can say that
[1:51:48] night you was delivered or set free or
[1:51:50] got a touch? Amen. There's a few hands.
[1:51:53] Maybe some of you wasn't even there that
[1:51:54] night. Amen. But there that but that
[1:51:56] night I know. Amen. That storm was just
[1:51:59] raging outside and you know and there
[1:52:01] was a a little girl was younger girl at
[1:52:04] that time now about to get married.
[1:52:06] Sister Kimberly wear. Amen. come up to
[1:52:08] that in that prayer line and and she
[1:52:10] said, "I I want my brother saved and our
[1:52:12] family back together and begin to
[1:52:14] confess things and and confess the
[1:52:16] promises of God and go and and with you
[1:52:18] know here here here the storm is taking
[1:52:20] place and you're wondering how is God in
[1:52:22] this? How is God moving?" And God's
[1:52:24] orchestrating it the whole time and
[1:52:27] there's a little young man laying over
[1:52:29] in a bed and he all of a sudden wakes up
[1:52:31] and he realized daddy and mama ain't
[1:52:33] home, sister ain't home. If I remember
[1:52:35] the story, right? He goes across town
[1:52:37] and brother so and so wasn't home and he
[1:52:39] goes straight down. Amen. That little
[1:52:41] road that our church was on and runs
[1:52:42] through about a 100 foot of fence. I
[1:52:44] know, brother Justin, you may not like
[1:52:45] telling me to me telling it. I don't
[1:52:47] know, but it's so good. I like to tell
[1:52:49] it
[1:52:50] anyhow. What was it? The roads were
[1:52:53] slick and his truck comes down and it
[1:52:56] makes it right into the parking lot and
[1:52:59] dies and can't move another inch.
[1:53:03] God, the faithful creator,
[1:53:07] didn't give him no way of escaping
[1:53:10] this. He couldn't come to the church and
[1:53:12] find out, hey, they're still here. I'm
[1:53:14] still okay. Let me go back home. Nobody
[1:53:16] know about this. He couldn't go back
[1:53:17] home if he wanted to, unless he wanted
[1:53:19] to
[1:53:22] walk. God moving in every sit. Do you
[1:53:25] understand what I'm saying? Amen.
[1:53:26] Sometimes we look at storms and we look
[1:53:28] at situations and we look at things and
[1:53:31] we wonder how in the world could God's
[1:53:32] hand God's hand is in everything.
[1:53:36] He said in his word, all things work
[1:53:38] together for the good to them that are
[1:53:40] thee called according to his purpose.
[1:53:42] How many are the called?
[1:53:46] Then God's hand is in everything of your
[1:53:48] life. He's a faithful creator. He's
[1:53:51] creating situations for you to be
[1:53:52] blessed. He's creating situations for
[1:53:54] you to go through a trial. He's creating
[1:53:56] situations for you to come out of a
[1:54:01] trial. Brother with his baby out on the
[1:54:04] porch sees this man, young man fall
[1:54:08] out. It's one of the greatest
[1:54:10] testimonies I ever heard in my
[1:54:12] life. Justin still in his
[1:54:17] jammers. He didn't care no
[1:54:19] more. We getting to holler. I got a
[1:54:22] chance. I got to find God. I remember
[1:54:24] leading the songs still at the pull pit
[1:54:26] and I looked up and I seen Justin wear
[1:54:28] coming on the back of two deacons or
[1:54:31] brother maybe brother Daryl one of I
[1:54:33] think it was brother Daryl he had his
[1:54:34] arm draped around him bringing him up
[1:54:37] just within a few moments of a little
[1:54:39] sister's prayer
[1:54:42] request God been creating that whole
[1:54:45] thing the whole day the whole week long
[1:54:48] time before making it work out till it
[1:54:52] was going to come on that
[1:54:56] Wednesday. You know, I was just I'd been
[1:54:59] with Brother Wayne before and we was
[1:55:00] trying to figure out a date and it ended
[1:55:03] up that was the only week he could come.
[1:55:06] The only
[1:55:07] week, but God knew it was the right
[1:55:11] week. God knew what we would be going
[1:55:13] through with my mom and her situation
[1:55:15] and how she would come at that same
[1:55:17] line, weak in her body. But it was for
[1:55:19] hours later stand over in the corner
[1:55:20] with their hands up giving praise to
[1:55:22] God. Strength had come back into her
[1:55:24] body again.
[1:55:26] He's a faithful creator. He has showed
[1:55:29] this time and time and time again.
[1:55:31] Notice though when Abraham when he
[1:55:33] finished there at that place, he did not
[1:55:36] name the place after about his
[1:55:40] trial. He didn't
[1:55:42] name the place where I almost killed my
[1:55:46] son. the place that I had my hardest
[1:55:49] trial. He didn't name the place after
[1:55:52] his trial or about his trial or a name
[1:55:54] that reminded him of his trial. I named
[1:55:56] the place a name that proclaimed God's
[1:55:59] deliverance.
[1:56:01] He's Jehovah Gyra. He knew the creator,
[1:56:04] the faithful creator had given the son.
[1:56:06] He had a promise and even he had to kill
[1:56:09] him. He knew God would raise him up
[1:56:11] again. He knew he was on under an
[1:56:13] unconditional covenant. He knew he had a
[1:56:16] token.
[1:56:19] Hello somebody. He also we are also got
[1:56:22] a token this morning. And it's a token
[1:56:25] for us and for our children.
[1:56:31] Paul told the man there he said you they
[1:56:34] told him the man over I believe it was
[1:56:36] over the over the prison said believe on
[1:56:38] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy
[1:56:40] house shall be saved. He said, "If you
[1:56:42] can believe for yourself, you can
[1:56:44] believe for your house also."
[1:56:47] Come on, somebody. If you can have
[1:56:49] enough faith that God in God to believe
[1:56:52] for yourself, you can have enough faith
[1:56:54] in God to believe for your children.
[1:56:58] The same faith that saved you is the
[1:57:00] same faith that'll save your children.
[1:57:04] If you don't, you just keep praying, God
[1:57:06] will answer prayer. Don't worry. Just
[1:57:08] ask him and believe it and get it
[1:57:11] anchored in your heart and just move
[1:57:14] on. God has provided a sacrifice. He's
[1:57:18] made the provision. He's provided the
[1:57:20] token. He has showed over and over and
[1:57:23] over and over throughout the whole Bible
[1:57:25] that he is the faithful creator.
[1:57:31] Can we testify to that? Have you read
[1:57:32] it? Amen. The Israelites when they left
[1:57:35] Egypt, Amen. He showed that he was a
[1:57:37] faithful creator that he would make a
[1:57:39] way, amen, through a wilderness that had
[1:57:41] a lot of obstacles, had a lot of
[1:57:43] trouble, had a lot of situation, had a
[1:57:45] lot of deniers, had a lot of people that
[1:57:47] was fussing and fuming and all kinds of
[1:57:49] stuff. But he still provided mana every
[1:57:51] morning. He still provided quail. He
[1:57:54] still provided, Amen. water out of the
[1:57:56] rock. He's a provider. Amen. Abra Aaron
[1:58:00] as soon you know as the first man of
[1:58:02] fell he said go out there and pick up
[1:58:04] some full of it and put it in the holy
[1:58:07] holies and when your children's children
[1:58:09] all that come in the priesthood they can
[1:58:11] get the same taste of the original mana.
[1:58:14] Hallelujah. And he's still providing
[1:58:16] today a taste of the original mana that
[1:58:20] fell on the day of Pentecost.
[1:58:23] There's still a taste of it that can
[1:58:25] come from the Holy of Holies and give
[1:58:27] you the same experience that they had
[1:58:30] 2,000 years ago.
[1:58:37] He would be the
[1:58:39] provider when he would provide them with
[1:58:41] fresh water from the rock. Now, if you
[1:58:45] don't want to believe it, that's up to
[1:58:46] you. I don't care. But I believe it.
[1:58:50] If God could completely build this earth
[1:58:53] out of nothing, then I can believe he
[1:58:55] can take water out of rock.
[1:58:59] This rock would actually follow them
[1:59:00] through the
[1:59:01] wilderness. Did y' understand this was a
[1:59:04] spiritual rock? It was signifying
[1:59:06] something that was
[1:59:08] coming. Amen. And it would follow them
[1:59:10] through the wilderness. And he would
[1:59:12] take it and he would strike it and then
[1:59:14] he would was to speak to it. So a
[1:59:16] showing, amen, that God would come and a
[1:59:19] man called Jesus, that rock that
[1:59:21] followed him in the wilderness and he
[1:59:23] would take a strike and he would be
[1:59:25] beaten. He would be placed upon a on an
[1:59:27] altar and he would and out of him would
[1:59:29] come water and blood and spirit. Amen.
[1:59:31] But in this day, we don't have to strike
[1:59:33] him again. We speak to the rock and
[1:59:36] water comes from it. We speak to the
[1:59:38] rock and he's a faithful provider to
[1:59:41] provide what we have need of in our time
[1:59:43] of trouble.
[1:59:50] He's a smitten
[1:59:54] rock here. It looks like come out of the
[1:59:58] driest of place. And you know sometimes
[2:00:01] God will provide for you out of a place
[2:00:03] that looks like impossible to be
[2:00:04] provided
[2:00:06] from.
[2:00:08] Impossible that this could provide what
[2:00:12] I have need of. That's just how God
[2:00:14] works. That's how God does. Amen. And
[2:00:18] when he he fed he fed Elijah by the
[2:00:20] ravens. He provided for a prophet in a
[2:00:23] time of famine. He was a faithful
[2:00:25] creator to create birds that would bring
[2:00:28] him a sandwich or bring him food, bring
[2:00:31] him meat, bring him
[2:00:33] bread. Is that the Bible?
[2:00:37] You know, he said, "One time I was
[2:00:38] preaching one time on Elijah and a man
[2:00:40] told me after service, "Now, wait a
[2:00:41] minute, preacher. I believe you got
[2:00:42] you're a more sane man. They actually
[2:00:44] believe them crows brought Elijah fish
[2:00:45] and bread." He said, "I believe every
[2:00:47] word of it." And the fish was fried and
[2:00:49] the bread was cooked.
[2:00:54] He would say another place. He said, "I
[2:00:56] don't know how a black cow can eat green
[2:00:58] grass and give white milk." He said,
[2:01:01] "But it ain't up to me to worry about.
[2:01:04] It's God that created
[2:01:05] it. Amen. He said, "Well, tell me then,
[2:01:08] my friend, where do these crows get that
[2:01:09] fried fish and bake bread?" He said,
[2:01:12] "That's not for me to question." It
[2:01:14] wasn't for Elijah to question. The only
[2:01:15] thing he knew when he got hungry, the
[2:01:17] crows are sitting there ready to bring
[2:01:19] him some bread and fish, and he ate it.
[2:01:21] That's the same thing about the baptism
[2:01:23] of the Holy Ghost. I can't tell you
[2:01:24] where it comes from or how it gets here.
[2:01:26] I know it comes, and I know I got it,
[2:01:28] and that's all I care about.
[2:01:31] I can't tell you how divine healing
[2:01:33] works, but I just drink from the
[2:01:35] promises of God and it brings it to
[2:01:37] pass. I don't try to find out what the
[2:01:39] formula is. I don't know what causes the
[2:01:41] Holy Ghost to fall in a meeting and
[2:01:43] people speak in tongues and prophesy and
[2:01:45] cripples jump up from wheelchairs and
[2:01:47] sick get healed. I can't tell you how it
[2:01:49] happens. Only thing I know is God
[2:01:51] promised it and it's our possession.
[2:01:55] Hallelujah. Later there was a woman,
[2:01:58] amen, in that same famine he would go to
[2:02:00] and she would be out in her yard
[2:02:02] gathering a few sticks to make her last
[2:02:06] meal and she would hear a
[2:02:09] voice fetch me a little more so of
[2:02:13] bread and she turned no doubt tears in
[2:02:15] her eyes said sir that's why I'm in this
[2:02:18] yard I got to get my last meal together
[2:02:21] and little spoonful of oil mix it
[2:02:23] together little few sticks to make a
[2:02:26] fire and bake a little cake for my son.
[2:02:28] We was we was going to eat it and die.
[2:02:30] He said, "But make me a cake
[2:02:33] first." See, that's what God's required.
[2:02:36] This is why he said it like that. Seek
[2:02:37] ye first the kingdom of God and all
[2:02:40] these things will be added unto you. Put
[2:02:42] God first. Put his word first. You want
[2:02:45] the faithful creator to work on your
[2:02:46] behalf? Put God's word first. Put his
[2:02:50] spirit first. Put him first. Bring me a
[2:02:53] little cake first.
[2:02:55] She turns not knowing why she's doing
[2:02:57] it, but she was led by the spirit of
[2:03:00] God. He said, "See, many times trouble
[2:03:03] will strike our home just like it had
[2:03:06] struck hers. And we don't know it's a
[2:03:09] blessing in
[2:03:12] disguise."
[2:03:14] What a blessing in disguise.
[2:03:19] Trouble. Well, you're sick. you know,
[2:03:22] you're sick because you you're just not
[2:03:24] not not right with God. That's why you
[2:03:26] did wrong. That doesn't always mean
[2:03:27] that. Job was right with God and he got
[2:03:30] sick. He went through trials. It was God
[2:03:34] testing him. It's God testing you to put
[2:03:36] you to a test to see how you will do.
[2:03:41] Maybe let the doctor say you won't get
[2:03:43] better for a purpose. Maybe you let them
[2:03:45] say to just see what you would do. See,
[2:03:48] we're near the coming of the Lord. God's
[2:03:49] coming for a bride. He never asked or
[2:03:51] questioned, "Will I have a church? Will
[2:03:53] I have a bride? Will I have
[2:03:54] righteousness?" But he asked, "Will I
[2:03:56] find faith when I come back? Will I find
[2:03:58] faith when I return?" God putting you to
[2:04:00] the test to try your faith. And all her
[2:04:03] trouble and death at the
[2:04:06] door. And she went and she scraped that
[2:04:09] last bit of oil and that last bit of
[2:04:12] meal and she mixed it together and she
[2:04:14] baked it and she gave it to the prophet
[2:04:17] of God.
[2:04:20] And the word began to speak out of his
[2:04:22] mouth, thus sayeth the Lord, because you
[2:04:24] have done this, the barrel won't run
[2:04:26] empty, go empty, and the crews won't run
[2:04:29] dry. And God provided the faithful
[2:04:31] creator all the way through the all the
[2:04:34] way to the end of the famine. Amen. What
[2:04:36] was it? God showing he's he is the
[2:04:38] faithful creator. I'm getting to
[2:04:40] something. He goes all the way go down
[2:04:42] through the three Hebrew children and
[2:04:43] the lion's den and all of that. God
[2:04:46] showing over and over. We we can go into
[2:04:48] the ministry of Jesus where he showed
[2:04:50] Amen. The first miracle he provided was
[2:04:53] water. He turned into wine. Amen. He
[2:04:56] showing he can turn around and change
[2:04:57] any situation in your life. Amen. He
[2:05:00] showed it and the and when he fed 5,000
[2:05:02] with a few little fish and a few little
[2:05:04] loaves of bread, what was he showing? He
[2:05:07] was showing he is the faithful creator.
[2:05:15] Let me just show you how much of a
[2:05:17] provider he really
[2:05:19] is. That he's concerned about every
[2:05:22] little details of our life.
[2:05:26] Brother Brandon would have this
[2:05:28] dream, this moment
[2:05:31] or however you want to say
[2:05:34] it, this event that he would go through
[2:05:37] that he
[2:05:39] would be out in the west somewhere come
[2:05:42] he'd see himself out in the west with a
[2:05:44] hat on and kicking his spurs and he was
[2:05:47] singing whistling song the wheels on the
[2:05:49] wagon are broken sign on the ranch is
[2:05:52] for sale that's a actually a ballad
[2:05:54] about
[2:05:55] death. And as he's singing that, he
[2:05:58] walks by and there was this little in
[2:06:00] this this old prairie schooner that was
[2:06:03] there on the side broken up, mangled up.
[2:06:06] Now, we know he would have a vision of
[2:06:08] going out west and and and he would and
[2:06:11] he would cluck the reinss of a prairie
[2:06:13] schooner and it turned into a station
[2:06:14] wagon. So, as a mo, you know, station
[2:06:17] wagon is a modern day prairie schooner.
[2:06:19] So it was showing there in this in this
[2:06:21] event or this dream vision whatever it
[2:06:23] was he had that that that Amen. he was
[2:06:27] right there at his death and when he met
[2:06:29] his death he stepped across the other
[2:06:31] side and there is this Sharon Rose
[2:06:33] standing there and she says hello
[2:06:36] daddy. He said well who are you? And she
[2:06:39] said I'm your little
[2:06:41] Sharon. She says Sharon. Why you? She
[2:06:44] was just a little baby but she said but
[2:06:47] over here we're not babies. were young
[2:06:49] men and women as you taught and as you
[2:06:52] as you preached and she began to talk to
[2:06:55] him actually about things that he hadn't
[2:06:56] even preached yet in his ministry. Amen.
[2:06:59] Because she was in a theophony form
[2:07:01] knowing all things. And here she is. She
[2:07:04] began to explain these things to him.
[2:07:06] And here he said, "Well, well," she
[2:07:08] said, "Mother's up there waiting in your
[2:07:10] new home." She said, "I I got I got a
[2:07:12] new home." We never had a new home,
[2:07:15] honey. Well, we got one here,
[2:07:17] Daddy. And I started up and I hear them
[2:07:20] singing the song. I see the lights of
[2:07:21] the city so bright. And I got up there
[2:07:23] and there she was standing there looking
[2:07:25] at me. And she put her arms around me
[2:07:27] and greeted me as she always did. She
[2:07:29] said, "Won't you sit down?" And I looked
[2:07:31] and there was a Morris chair. And I
[2:07:34] started looking at that Morris chair,
[2:07:35] looking back at her, and she said, "I
[2:07:37] know what you're thinking about." Now he
[2:07:39] said one time down here we had one of
[2:07:41] those chairs and the chair cost about
[2:07:43] $15 and I was going to buy it and I
[2:07:44] bought it made a $2 payment paying about
[2:07:46] a dollar a week and when you get to a
[2:07:48] place you can't make the ends meet no
[2:07:50] more you know what I'm talking about no
[2:07:51] disgrace to be poor I just couldn't make
[2:07:53] the ends meet no more and I missed two
[2:07:54] or three payments and they told me they
[2:07:56] was going to come and get it and they we
[2:07:58] couldn't continue and she so when that
[2:08:00] one day they did when they when I was
[2:08:02] gone they come and took it and said I'll
[2:08:03] never forget it I come home and she
[2:08:05] baked me a nice cherry pie my favorite
[2:08:07] and she said come in. I went to the
[2:08:09] front room. My chair was gone. I'd
[2:08:11] worked all day and preached half the
[2:08:12] night and then come and sat in the chair
[2:08:14] cuz I liked it. And they come and took
[2:08:16] it from me. And she said, "Won't you sit
[2:08:17] down now?" And the chair looked like
[2:08:19] only much bigger. Just looked like it,
[2:08:21] but only much bigger. She said,
[2:08:23] "Remember that one down on the earth?" I
[2:08:24] said, "Yes." She said, "Bill, they'll
[2:08:27] never take this one. They'll never take
[2:08:30] this one. This one is paid for. It's
[2:08:33] yours. Sit down and enjoy it. He is a
[2:08:36] faithful creator.
[2:08:38] Listen, I I want you to understand,
[2:08:40] we're not going over there, Amen, to go
[2:08:43] through the millennium and just be a
[2:08:44] bunch of singers around a throne. No,
[2:08:46] we're going to have real lives.
[2:08:48] We're going to do real things. It's in
[2:08:51] the Bible. We're going to have real
[2:08:53] things. We're going to Amen. have real
[2:08:54] touch and real feelings, but in perfect
[2:08:57] in a perfect place and a perfect body.
[2:09:02] And those things they'll never take from
[2:09:04] you ever again.
[2:09:09] As we bring this down to a
[2:09:13] close, brother Brandham would tell the
[2:09:17] story quite a
[2:09:19] bit. Said he got asked by somebody said,
[2:09:22] "You got any
[2:09:24] insurance?" He said, "Oh yeah, I got
[2:09:26] insurance." He said, "Well, oh, I'm
[2:09:28] sorry. I didn't realize you had
[2:09:30] insurance." I said, "Yeah." "What kind
[2:09:32] of insurance you got?" Blessed
[2:09:35] asssurance, Jesus is
[2:09:38] mine. Oh, what a foretaste of glory to
[2:09:41] divine. Said he stopped and looked at me
[2:09:43] a little bit. He said, "Well, Bill,
[2:09:45] that's that's okay." He said, "But it
[2:09:48] won't put you in a
[2:09:49] graveyard." He said, "I know, but it'll
[2:09:52] get me out."
[2:09:57] Hallelujah. It'll get me out. I'm not
[2:10:00] worried about getting it there. Getting
[2:10:03] in there. I'm worried about getting out
[2:10:05] of there. It's the getting out I want to
[2:10:07] do. He said, "The Holy Spirit is God's
[2:10:09] insurance agent this afternoon, giving
[2:10:12] policies out to whosoever will receive
[2:10:14] them." You can have one.
[2:10:18] You can have one and it you don't have
[2:10:20] to worry about it coming into a place of
[2:10:22] not being in effect no more. You won't
[2:10:24] have to worry about him cancelling your
[2:10:26] policy.
[2:10:28] God help us for a moment. Can I preach
[2:10:30] just for a moment? Can we just let go
[2:10:32] just for a moment? Amen. Because a lot
[2:10:35] of times we got insurance and you know
[2:10:36] you'll pay insurance month after month
[2:10:38] after month after month after year after
[2:10:40] year after year and the first time you
[2:10:42] make some claim they want to drop you.
[2:10:44] They want to cancel you and know most of
[2:10:45] all they want to go up on your insurance
[2:10:47] premium. Amen. You ain't got to worry
[2:10:49] about with this God. Hallelujah. If you
[2:10:52] ever draw a policy from him, he's not
[2:10:54] going to get you in a place and you're
[2:10:56] going to find yourself in a bad
[2:10:58] situation and you're going to need your
[2:10:59] help, his help, and you going to write
[2:11:01] across you cancelled. Are you going to
[2:11:03] ride enough you ain't got enough money?
[2:11:04] No sir. He is already paid for. It's
[2:11:08] already done. It's already finished.
[2:11:10] It's already given to you. All you got
[2:11:13] to do is send it in and claim it this
[2:11:15] morning. Hallelujah. He's a faithful
[2:11:17] provider. And he's not got just enough.
[2:11:20] He's got more than enough.
[2:11:24] I tell you what, I read something the
[2:11:26] other day. One of me just get m
[2:11:28] righteous
[2:11:32] indignation. You know, you hear of all
[2:11:34] these bad things happening. Me and I
[2:11:37] think me and brother me and brother
[2:11:38] Joseph Winter was talking about
[2:11:41] insurance bad things happening in the
[2:11:44] world and all the calamities and the
[2:11:45] tornadoes and the hurricane. It's like,
[2:11:47] man, how can they even make
[2:11:49] money? So, man, no wonder they just go
[2:11:51] up on your premiums all the time. Up and
[2:11:54] up and up. Is that not happening? Nobody
[2:11:57] else. Okay. I thought so.
[2:11:59] Probably. And here up up. Not even made
[2:12:03] a claim. Up up
[2:12:06] up. I Well, maybe they ain't making no
[2:12:09] money. So, I done a quick Google shirt
[2:12:12] search. Last year, State Farm made, I
[2:12:15] don't know, $43
[2:12:21] billion.
[2:12:24] What? All state made in the billions of
[2:12:28] dollars.
[2:12:32] What? Faulty. I I tell you, I just be
[2:12:35] honest with you. I think insurance is
[2:12:37] the biggest scam there is upon the
[2:12:38] earth. I'll just be honest with you.
[2:12:40] YouTube can delete me if they want to
[2:12:42] delete me. I don't give a
[2:12:44] rip cuz it's the truth. They want to
[2:12:47] cut. You want to pay and pay and pay and
[2:12:49] they want to go up and up and up and you
[2:12:51] make a claim. We've made claims upon
[2:12:52] this church and they want to cancel
[2:12:55] us because of real
[2:12:57] claims. Come on, somebody. But one thing
[2:13:00] about God, you don't have to worry about
[2:13:01] him cancelelling your
[2:13:04] policy. You know, insurance talk. Let me
[2:13:08] just stay on insurance for a moment.
[2:13:09] Them rotten sorry dogs.
[2:13:13] They came around my grandmother years
[2:13:15] ago and I offered her this policy that
[2:13:17] was going to put her in the grave, you
[2:13:18] know, and it because it's tell you what
[2:13:20] brother Brandon was talking about. You
[2:13:21] know, this the same stuff he was off
[2:13:22] they was offering brother Brandham.
[2:13:24] Guarantee you scam. And here they are
[2:13:27] offering my grandmother say her grand
[2:13:28] they paid all this money but then they
[2:13:30] went around and as they realize hey cost
[2:13:33] of barrel is going up things are going
[2:13:35] up and they go through the crooked
[2:13:36] politics of Louisiana and probably
[2:13:38] through any other state and they pass a
[2:13:40] law that it only would pay out like
[2:13:41] eight I don't know 500 bucks when it
[2:13:43] came down. It's supposed to pay for the
[2:13:44] whole funeral.
[2:13:46] How many knows that? Yeah. And it comes
[2:13:49] right down to it and only pays about
[2:13:50] five three or 500 bucks on the whole
[2:13:52] thing. Big
[2:13:54] whoop.
[2:13:55] Scam. This is what brother Brandon was
[2:13:58] talking about. It's a
[2:14:00] scam. Amen. He knew he couldn't rely on
[2:14:03] some man-made policy, some man-made
[2:14:05] decree, some man-made organization, some
[2:14:09] man-made thing. That's why I'm so
[2:14:11] thankful this morning. We're not relying
[2:14:12] on what man-made or man decree or man
[2:14:15] says. Amen. Our cost of our our ticket
[2:14:18] to heaven don't go up or down. It's
[2:14:20] already paid for. Our cost for healing
[2:14:23] doesn't go up or down. It's already paid
[2:14:25] for. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:14:30] While we're on it, I might as well ought
[2:14:31] to tell you what a scam the Catholics
[2:14:33] are. You having to pay for to get healed
[2:14:35] and pay to get saved and pay for your
[2:14:37] family to get out of the pay pay. No,
[2:14:39] it's already paid for. It's already
[2:14:42] done. It's already finished. God's
[2:14:46] already done it. I can stand here upon
[2:14:48] his word because he's a faithful
[2:14:50] creator. And I know when I get to a
[2:14:52] place, he's going to make a way through
[2:14:54] it. Amen. I don't know sometimes how
[2:14:56] it's going to happen. It seems
[2:14:58] impossible. It seems like it ain't no
[2:15:00] way I'm going to get through this
[2:15:01] situation. But somehow God in his mercy
[2:15:04] opens up the way or he gives me wings to
[2:15:07] fly over or whatever he does. God is the
[2:15:10] faithful creator
[2:15:12] and he's faithful to you this morning.
[2:15:15] Let's bow our heads.
[2:15:31] finish our story. In case you don't
[2:15:33] know, Brother Justin's the one playing
[2:15:35] our bass this here at the church now.
[2:15:37] It's been back
[2:15:39] since, my goodness, 10, 11 years ago,
[2:15:43] somewhere in
[2:15:44] there. God rich in mercy.
[2:15:50] God rich in mercy. Satan always take
[2:15:53] from you more than what you can put
[2:16:00] out. He's an insurance
[2:16:04] scammer. Always taking more than what
[2:16:06] you can put out. But God will give you
[2:16:09] more than what you can put
[2:16:12] in. God is rich in mercy.
[2:16:29] How many would say, "Lord, help me to
[2:16:30] rely upon your
[2:16:33] faithfulness. Let me really see you,
[2:16:35] Lord, as Jehovah Gyra, my
[2:16:43] provider, a God rich in mercy and grace.
[2:16:53] Father, we ask Lord God that you would
[2:16:56] just let your word settle in our hearts
[2:17:01] today. We can see you as a faithful
[2:17:05] creator. So many examples of you being
[2:17:09] faithful and you are faithful.
[2:17:13] Thank you, Jesus. See, the hands are
[2:17:16] lifted all over this building, God.
[2:17:17] Sometimes our eyes get on a lot of
[2:17:19] circumstances and situations around
[2:17:22] us. God, help us to keep our eyes on
[2:17:29] you, the faithful
[2:17:33] one. We ask it in Jesus
[2:17:36] name. Amen. Stand to our feet for a
[2:17:39] moment. said, "Brother
[2:17:43] Timothy, what if all around me seems
[2:17:47] impossible? What if all what if it just
[2:17:50] seems like there ain't no way through
[2:17:53] this and it seems impossible?" Let me
[2:17:54] just read this out of Habacook 3. Maybe
[2:17:58] bring that up. Habacook 3 and verse 17.
[2:18:02] What am I to do, brother Timothy? When
[2:18:04] it seems like everything I try,
[2:18:06] everything it just like sand going
[2:18:08] through my
[2:18:09] fingers, what am I to do?
[2:18:16] Habacook 3 says, "Although the fig tree
[2:18:20] shall not
[2:18:22] blossom, although neither shall fruit be
[2:18:25] in the
[2:18:26] vines, maybe the labor of olive shall
[2:18:29] fail, and the field shall yield no meat,
[2:18:33] and the flock shall be cut off from the
[2:18:35] fold, and there shall be no herds in the
[2:18:39] stall." What? What am I to do? What?
[2:18:42] That sounds like an impossible
[2:18:43] situation.
[2:18:46] fig tree ain't blossoming. There ain't
[2:18:48] no fruit on the vines. The olive trees
[2:18:51] have fell and all fallen off the fruit.
[2:18:53] The fields ain't yielded to no meat. The
[2:18:55] flocks are cut off. And there shall be
[2:18:58] no herd in the stall. What am I to do
[2:19:03] yet? I will rejoice in the
[2:19:06] Lord. I will joy in the God of my
[2:19:09] salvation. For the Lord God is my
[2:19:12] strength and he will make my feet like
[2:19:14] Hines's feet. In other words, able to
[2:19:18] jump out of my situation, able to get
[2:19:20] out of this and he will make me a He'll
[2:19:24] make me to walk upon my high
[2:19:27] places.
[2:19:28] Hallelujah. Although it seems all around
[2:19:31] me is impossible, it seems like there's
[2:19:34] no way out, yet I will rejoice in the
[2:19:37] Lord.
[2:19:40] Are there any rejoicers in the house
[2:19:42] this morning?
[2:19:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I tell you what,
[2:19:46] if God ain't done nothing for you, just
[2:19:48] go ahead and be quiet. But if God has
[2:19:50] done something for you, go ahead and
[2:19:52] praise him right now. If you see that
[2:19:55] he's providing for you, you see that
[2:19:56] he's working when he don't seem to be
[2:19:58] working. If you see that he's making a
[2:20:00] way when there seems to be no way, why
[2:20:02] don't you go ahead and lift up that hand
[2:20:04] and rejoice anyhow in the face of what
[2:20:07] troubles
[2:20:09] you. In spite of it all, I will rejoice
[2:20:13] cuz it ain't this stuff that gives me my
[2:20:15] strength. My God is my
[2:20:18] strength and he's going to make a way
[2:20:21] out of my
[2:20:22] situation. All I got to do is praise
[2:20:24] him. Listen, that's the truth. That's
[2:20:27] all you got to do. Break out of that
[2:20:28] thing. Don't let that thing hold you no
[2:20:30] longer. Don't let it set there on you no
[2:20:33] more. That depression that wants to come
[2:20:35] over you in the night time or that thing
[2:20:37] that wants to set upon you and say,
[2:20:38] "There ain't no way out of here. There
[2:20:40] ain't no way out of this situation.
[2:20:42] There ain't no way out of this trouble.
[2:20:43] There's no way this one's going to
[2:20:46] there's no way your child's going to
[2:20:47] say." Get out of that nonsense. My Lord
[2:20:50] will provide an a sacrifice. My God's a
[2:20:53] provider. I know he'll make a way when
[2:20:55] there seems to be no way. He's done it
[2:20:58] before and he'll do it
[2:21:00] again. He's my God and he's going to
[2:21:04] make it when I
[2:21:06] can't. He's going to give me the ability
[2:21:09] when I have none and I'm going to praise
[2:21:12] him for
[2:21:13] it. I'm going to magnify his name. Oh,
[2:21:16] let's sing this song to you.
