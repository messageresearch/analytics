[0:02] I got a lot of spots. Well, you got a
[0:04] spotless sacrifice.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; That he might present us spotless.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; That he might pre present us spotless.
[0:15] It's not me making sure I got everything
[0:17] crossed. Listen, Pharisees had that
[0:19] done. They would do the right times and
[0:22] the right prayers and the right this and
[0:23] the right that. Wouldn't touch this,
[0:24] wouldn't touch that, would stone
[0:26] somebody for doing it.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Had it all figured out.
[0:30] But that wasn't the rest that Jesus
[0:31] wanted.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; That wasn't the blood Jesus really
[0:35] wanted or God required. It was the blood
[0:38] of a perfect sacrifice that he that
[0:40] sacrifice can present us spotless.
[0:44] Amen. He said, see, you can see in the
[0:46] Old Testament type, let us go back to
[0:47] the Garden of Eden and the first news
[0:49] came from glory that the son Adam had
[0:51] been lost. Did God send an angel? Did he
[0:53] send a son? Did he send an unlike? No.
[0:55] No. He came himself to redeem that lost
[0:58] son. God did not entrust his plan of
[1:00] salvation to another. He trusted only
[1:02] himself. God was made flesh and dwelt
[1:06] among us and redeemed us unto himself
[1:08] and were saved by the blood of God. The
[1:11] eternal God and dwelt a mortal body in
[1:14] order to take away sin. He became the
[1:16] lamb in order to shed his blood and
[1:19] enter into the veil with it. Consider
[1:22] this. Since it was the blood of God, it
[1:24] is a perfect blood. And if it's a
[1:26] perfect blood that has loosed us from
[1:28] power and bondage and defilement of sin,
[1:31] then the loosen is perfect and complete.
[1:34] There is now therefore no condemnation.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:40] God's elect.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; Well, if somebody's laying something to
[1:44] your charge, I can tell you who it is.
[1:45] It's Satan.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz once that sin has been dipped under
[1:50] the blood of Jesus Christ, it's
[1:52] remembered no more.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55] Yeah,
[1:55] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; I got a lot dipped down in there.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful I ain't got to go
[2:02] before him every day and wonder if he
[2:05] still remembers when I did this wrong.
[2:06] And when it still remembers when I No, I
[2:08] can boldly go before the throne of grace
[2:11] cuz I'm not coming in on my own
[2:13] marriage, my own abilities. He is
[2:15] presenting me spotless.
[2:17] [Applause]
[2:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22] Who can lay anything to the charge of
[2:23] God's elect? Well, I can tell you, you
[2:26] know, you did this wrong and you did
[2:28] that and condemnation, condemnation,
[2:30] condemn this, condemn that. That's the
[2:32] devil.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; Quit listening to his voice.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Now, it's from God and you did wrong and
[2:39] it convicts your heart. Make it right.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Just like brother Brandham talked about
[2:43] that woman. You know,
[2:45] I think brother John Andy's did a little
[2:47] demonstration in our camp about that
[2:48] woman that was standing in line. I think
[2:50] it was a woman, right? Anyway, had
[2:52] something going on in her life and he
[2:53] said, "If you've done such and such
[2:54] such, he said, "Step back out. Step out
[2:56] of the line. Make it right. Ask God to
[2:58] forgive you. Step back in the line."
[3:03] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; Come on, young person. If you done
[3:07] something wrong, step out of the line.
[3:09] Make it right before God. Get back in
[3:11] line.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; It ain't no coming service after service
[3:16] and crying out to God for hours and
[3:17] hour. No. Make it right.
[3:20] and say, "God, I was wrong." That's what
[3:21] conviction is. It brings you to a place
[3:24] that you can ask God for repentance and
[3:25] you can make things right. Condemnation
[3:27] just hangs it over your head.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; The devil's constantly, "Oh, he
[3:31] remembers. He got a big list.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; He's constantly trying to bring it up
[3:35] and constantly trying to That is not God
[3:37] talking to you cuz God doesn't even
[3:39] remember it no more.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; He's not the one coming to you when you
[3:42] try to raise your hands and say, "Well,
[3:44] you remember last week or last month or
[3:46] when you used to do this or used to do
[3:48] you remember?" Haha, you that's
[3:50] condemnation. That is the voice of the
[3:52] devil.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; But if you have done wrong and God
[3:56] speaks to your heart, he'll show it to
[3:58] you. Make it clear so you can make it
[4:00] right.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; And once it's right, it's over.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Step out of the line, make it right. Get
[4:08] back in line.
[4:09] &gt;&gt; But condemnation wants you to step out
[4:11] of the line and stay out of the line.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. He wants you to step out and
[4:17] and you stay out and you get away from
[4:19] fellowship and you get away from this.
[4:21] Why? Because you're never worthy to come
[4:23] around them people. Listen, we ain't
[4:24] none of us worthy to be here.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; There's not one person sitting in a seat
[4:29] this morning or standing here on this
[4:31] platform or sitting there that is worthy
[4:33] to be here this morning. I'm not here
[4:35] because I'm worthy. I'm here because
[4:38] he's worthy.
[4:40] [Music]
[4:42] I don't believe what I believe cuz I'm
[4:44] worthy. I believe it cuz he's worthy.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; His death gave us the blood and that
[4:56] blood has loosed us.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; There is now no condemnation. What kind
[5:04] of service could we have if there was no
[5:07] condemnation?
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If there wasn't that little
[5:14] thought that wanted to come and Satan
[5:16] implant something in your mind just a
[5:17] moment you're about to have a
[5:18] breakthrough. What if that wasn't there?
[5:20] I'll tell you what would be. You'd go
[5:22] ahead and have your breakthrough.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; What if that wasn't there every time you
[5:27] went to lift your hands or you went to
[5:28] praise God. Listen, I tell you what
[5:30] would happen. You would go ahead and
[5:32] lift your hands. You go ahead and praise
[5:34] God.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can realize and get a real
[5:38] clear picture of where that stuff is
[5:40] coming from, you'll cast down that
[5:42] condemnation and say, "That's not me. I
[5:45] didn't ask God to forgive me. It's
[5:47] already done. It's finished. It's over
[5:49] with. I'll raise my hands. I'll praise
[5:52] God. I'll glorify him anyway cuz I have
[5:56] a perfect sacrifice.
[6:01] And I have faith in it
[6:03] &gt;&gt; that in if I do make a mistake, there's
[6:06] still a blood.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; I can understand you not having faith in
[6:13] the blood of bulls and goats anymore.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; I can understand you having faith and
[6:19] not having faith and if it was my blood
[6:20] or somebody else in here in blood that
[6:22] you're trying to apply. I can understand
[6:24] that. We're not talking about any of
[6:26] that.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a perfect blood.
[6:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:33] He saw Adam and Eve as they would leave
[6:34] the garden
[6:36] castaways.
[6:38] Could you imagine the condemnation they
[6:40] had?
[6:45] All the things he done wrong. Brother
[6:47] just reading over it before I come out.
[6:48] Brother Ram says Eve begin to feel that
[6:50] arthritis. She be he be getting to feel
[6:54] those pains.
[6:56] She begins to say, "Adam, what have I
[6:58] done?
[7:00] What have I done?"
[7:04] Adam says, "Eve, what have I done?"
[7:08] And he said, "God was watching Adam go
[7:11] out." He said, "Because Adam didn't have
[7:12] to. He was not deceived. He willingly
[7:14] took her to himself
[7:17] &gt;&gt; cuz he knew if he took her to himself,
[7:20] he would save her or God would have to
[7:21] strike him, too.
[7:24] [Music]
[7:26] And God saw that and he said something
[7:28] sparked in the heart of God.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thy seed." And he begins to
[7:34] talk about the immity. I'll put an
[7:35] immity between thy seed and the
[7:37] serpent's seed. You won't always have to
[7:39] live this way.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; They used to have to live that way in
[7:45] the Old Testament because they was under
[7:47] the blood of go bulls and goats. Satan
[7:49] had a right to bring his condemnation
[7:51] cuz they would go in with a lust spirit
[7:53] and come out with a lust spirit. They
[7:55] would go in with situations in their
[7:56] life and come right out with it. They
[7:57] had a covering but they didn't have
[7:59] something that would annihilate it. But
[8:01] now as he said, I'll put him in. He said
[8:03] I could just say switch the scene for a
[8:05] moment. He said I see him crying out for
[8:06] his life. I see him screaming for him to
[8:09] be crucified and I watch him walking up
[8:11] that old hill called Goltha and I see a
[8:13] white robe. You start getting bright red
[8:15] spots in it. He said, "Before long, it's
[8:17] all red." And he said, "I see him nail
[8:19] him to the cross. I see him put him up
[8:21] there and push the push the pole up and
[8:23] sink it in the ground. I see him cry
[8:26] out, "God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[8:29] He said, "But I see him say, it is
[8:31] finished."
[8:32] [Applause]
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. If you do a study, I
[8:40] was actually looking to preach on it,
[8:42] but I hadn't got there yet. But if you
[8:43] do a study on it is finished is a word
[8:45] that means actually three things. All
[8:48] the sin debt is paid.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All the sin data debt is
[8:53] paid. All the debt, all the debt that
[8:56] you ever owed is done away with. Amen.
[8:59] All your healing and deliverance is
[9:00] done. Amen. Not only that, he's also
[9:03] finished the back of Satan. He's crushed
[9:05] him under his feet. Amen. Listen, that
[9:08] that devil that's want to hang over you
[9:09] and put all kind of nonsense on your
[9:11] head, he is a defeated devil. Listen, he
[9:14] that that condemnation that he's putting
[9:17] on you is actually his condemnation.
[9:19] It's what's going to condemn him and put
[9:22] him into hell. Amen. What brother say
[9:24] about that? He said when you ask God to
[9:26] forgive you, all of that sin is rolled
[9:29] off of your back and is transferred onto
[9:32] your accuser. And he said he will go to
[9:35] hell for your sins.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is what it was. He said
[9:41] it's finished. No longer will my
[9:44] children have to be under condemnation,
[9:46] but they can live above it. That's
[9:49] right. Amen. Wonderful.
