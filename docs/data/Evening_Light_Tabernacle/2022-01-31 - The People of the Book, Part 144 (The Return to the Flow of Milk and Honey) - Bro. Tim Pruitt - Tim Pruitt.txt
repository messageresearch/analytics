god physically spiritually in every way lord bring deliverance for your people today around the world wherever they are assembled where you just meet with them and speak to them today let your word go

bring healing and deliverance we pray as we look to you now in jesus name those that are not here with us today seek them out lord and deal with him in a special way father whatever their need is supplied we pray in jesus name amen and amen god bless you thank you jesus [Music] amen god bless you it's good to be in the house of the lord be in the presence of the great king of glory amen singing about how great he is we have found out how great he is i want to thank you for your prayers as i bring back greetings from brother ron spencer and the church there in in elkton um virginia we were there at his dad's funeral and spoke there and then sunday service and spoke there and had prayer with brother ron and he's been suffering some issues some real pain but he went back wednesday and uh they did complete scans and all his scams were good and that everything is stable and so it's a miracle amen as we're seeing the miracle working power of god you know you can't be on chemo that long now two years and and still be healthy and well that's uh that's impossible but the bible said if you drink any deadly thing it wouldn't hurt you amen so these signs do follow them that believe and we are believers also greetings from brothers sean martin brother andrew glover we were in brother andrew's home and stayed with him preached for brother sean and so we bring back greetings from all of them amen and we're going to read the scripture um and i'll tell you i'll read this verse in exodus chapter 3 and verse eight and we will read death um together and he said and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians to bring them up out of that land and into a good land and large unto a land flowing with milk and honey and to the place of the canaanites the hittites the amorites and the parasites and the hybites and the jebusites god bless you can be seated you know we got a lot of things that are going on in the world that we're living in and i just want to make a few brief statements about that because i believe we are living in perilous times and it is a time that we should all be making our call in an election sure and uh knowing where we stand in this hour taking our stand on the on the word of god and uh just um you know making making sure we have unpacked everything to go amen because brother branham told us in this journey that we're taking we don't pack up to go we unpack we lay aside every sin and every weight that so easily besets us and so um and i you know i know as believers as we know we're in perilous times and there are serious moments in time i'm just like you without you know i i just ponder you know trying to understand what is happening even as um mr biden contemplates sending troops to the ukraine and there is war that is threatened with russia and we know we have seen advancements in science with the driverless car and it is here and i'll be testing on u.s highways and we can see plainly the rise of women and the moral decay of the country and the horrible liberal agenda that is quickly taken away many of our freedoms even as americans and then um you know if kamala is the fulfillment of brother branham's vision of a woman rising in power which i i don't know for certain that is true but if she is she certainly um is a woman who is risen in power and is a vice president as brother branham said i believe that there would be one that would be a vice president or president um and and so but if she is that one well um the next thing will be will be smoke bombs and craters all over the united states of america and the vision did tell us to watch russia to keep your eyes on the king of the north and never in our u.s history have we seen such a weak and pandering president it's at such a time as this that russia could certainly make her move and be able to do this brother branham always felt the bombs would come from russia and said so but the vision and the vision i can't find were in those seven visions that he was actually told where the bombs would come from but it's a self s a safe assumption i guess um since we're told to watch russia and keep our eyes on the king of the north i do know this we are in overtime and the last stages come and his messenger is gone and now we are been here as long as he was here he died at 56 and now has been gone for 56 years and surely we're at the end but i want to just say he will have a bride who has made herself ready who's putting on the righteousness of the saints and so this is the hour that we're living in i think i that would be what we should be doing in this hour making preparations to leave not exactly knowing how everything will come to pass but every word of god will come to pass and so we are standing here looking by faith and faith is a long arranged vision and we're trying to look in through the the gloom and the darkness of this age to understand what is going on in this hour but um i'm glad that we know in whom we have believed and we are assured of that and i know that we're making preparations you know there is another dimension i know there is beyond a shadow of a doubt i stood there many years ago as a little boy in brother branham's meetings and i saw him i saw him pull from another dimension of an angel of god that and i couldn't see sometimes men would be privileged to see them um and see the angel of god or the pillar of fire and it was seen many many times and and witnessed but at the same time you know for the most part many would sit there and never saw it that didn't mean they wasn't spiritual that means that god didn't open their eyes to it and so in this um i just want to say that i i saw it speak from that other dimension things of people's hearts um discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and beyond that i i know that i received a birth from that other dimension so i know that dimension is real even though you may not see it there either because when man fell we become subject just to the five senses of the flesh and lost the the clarity of our spiritual sense that adam had when when god come and walked among them and and so you know we we look through a glass darkly as the bible said and but however we know there is a land we know there is that dimension we may not we may be able to see into the in the clear blue yonder there and maybe see a star from millions of miles away whatever they say that they are i have to take i have to take their word for it because i'd never been there and never measured it but nevertheless how many how far away it is you know we can see there and say well i don't see that dimension but you see i know that dimension is real and i know that there are things that have happened in this age from that dimension it happened to me from that dimension and so we know that we're we've got a place that we're going to and we know that one day that those from that dimension will come here and we will be changed when we see them and we'll be caught up to meet the lord in the air and they again the world won't even see that it'll be a dimension unknown to the rest of them so today as we prepare let's just um get ready to meet the lord you know we may not understand everything that's going on in the world and and what science is doing what the liberal politics is doing where that will lead us to with uh the marxism that we're seeing the the wormy eating and the in the nation with with communism and with socialism and we may not be able to see everything clearly on every on every aspect of it but one thing we can see clear and that is we have been born again from another world and we're predestined for that world so let's just press on this morning with all our hearts i want you to turn with me to deuteronomy chapter eight and verse seven i'm going to minister on something that while i was preaching my new year's sermon i struck a point of inspiration of the on the good land of the bible that we have returned to by malachi 4 and i want to talk about that this morning as we just pick up that little little bit of inspiration and look at that i have other things that i'm looking at in this same thought they are our purpose but today we're going to be speaking on the return to the flow of milk and honey so there is um you know we're going to be speaking real clearly about the land the land it flowing and and then the return to that land and the land gushing forth its waters and its riches and then we're going to be speaking about the milk and honey that we have as believers so in deuteronomy chapter 8 and verse 7 for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good lamb a land of brooks of water of fountains of and depths that spring out of valleys and hills a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranate a land of olive oil olive and honey a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack anything in it i want you to get catch this what it's saying bread without scarceness thou shalt not lock anything in it a land whose stones are iron and out of heels that make us dig brass so here he's telling them that there is um a land that you're going to and it has every kind of thing within it that is necessary for your to sustain you upon the earth whether it be brass or iron or the bread or whatever it is you will not lack of of wheat or barley or vines and fig trees or pomegranates or olive oil or honey you're not going to like anything this land has got a land of abundance in the and the land in that land it flows freely now malachite 4 speaks of restoration it speaks of turning the heart back to the faith so it's a return it is not something new and and let me just say when they would leave egypt to go to the promised land they were not going to a different land than that of abraham isaac and jacob but they were going to the land of their fathers amen and it's it's to a place of faith where the i am god was found and and where he revealed himself and where he has revealed himself as el shaddai more than enough how many found he's more than enough and he's a lie is a land where new names are given and you don't live by names of like abram but you're given a new letter to your name and that new letter in itself represented god coming down into the name of abram and there it would be god himself coming down into him renewing his body changing him where that he could bring forth the promised son because the bible said his body was now dead is that right amen so again it will come down it will be god himself and the promised son and remember it's in that as we parallel it just a moment where the 2000 year old woman the church comes to life again and brings forth the messiah amen the hour the time where there is no baroness among us but where that we the church brings forth life are you with me now and we're an unbelieving old church a baron sarah or sarah has changed to sarah again god taken the h which would represent his his own self in that character a part of his own name and putting it in in the name of sarah changing her name and he would come down in her notice and turn her heart back to believing again and given her the promised son and where this is a line where jacobs are changed from deceiver amen a deceiver a liar a thief a you know a a horrible person a betrayer are you with me amen and would be changed from from that to israel a prince it's a royalty because the change doesn't come by reformation or by psychology but by a supernatural visitation from the almighty god now years after the return from egypt we know that that israel would be dispersed into babylon and and would return again and rebuild the temple and which would restore them back to worship again ezra would come and bring back the word and the bible would be known and and the people would rejoice as the book was open and god would show zechariah seven golden candlesticks and he showed that they were supplied with unlimited oil from two olive trees notice this because this parallels our day we also have been shown seven golden candle sticks and we've been shown that the same quad that has been here in one age would light the fire in the next stage and as it was lit from there would go to the next and would go to the next and so zechariah was 14 and 4 and 6 says this is the word of the lord to jerubal saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord who art thou great o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shall become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstones of it thereof was shouting saying grace grace unto it there's great favor that has been given to this age to this time showing us the seven golden candlesticks and god working down to the ages but he would show that again it was done with an unlimited supply and i want to give these thoughts to you as we go because it flows with milk and honey it's a unlimited supply and i want to remind our church this morning as we go into the new year that god's supply is limitless that there's more than enough and that he's here in this age and this time with with not just grace but double grace the favor of god upon a people in this end time to bring them into a rapture an hour this is so important that we never forget that what we have is unlimited the capstone of course that is spoke of um is threefold it is the capping off of all the mysteries of god that's what the seven thunders were amen there would be the final revelation given to the church and in doing so it would it would give an unlimited supply like luther was limited to justification the few things that he understood and wesley was sanctification the few things he understood and pentecost was they they had their their revelation that they have but it was all limited but i want you to know that what you have received is an unlimited resource amen we can never run out of sermons we can never run out of material we can never run out of spiritual food and man because it's an unlimited supply you see again it's the cap and off of all the mysteries of god he will bring forth the headstone the capstone amen with grace grace other ages receive grace but this age receives a capstone with double grace double favor are you with me amen now it's also the capping off of the individual for the individual but the capstone is the holy ghost and so it's a finishing stone that must seal every believer so with that again it's an unlimited supply it's not a portion of the spirit somebody help me preach now it's not just justification or sanctification a dip of the spirit or a little release of it but this is where god empties it out this is where the fullness comes this is where that the people are being capped off with the token that gets them ready for a rapture that laying within them is rapturing faith because the holy ghost is lying within them and finally we come back to the final capstone of the church which is jesus christ physically to take away his people other ages have had him in portion other ages has had him you know in um as we said portions of the holy spirit being poured out and they saw him as the spirit of god the spirit of jesus but i want you to know this age will be capped off with the physical return of jesus christ that means all the fullness of god manifest it so we're not in the age of portion we're in the age of double portion hallelujah the age of double portion what others had in the portion you receive a double portion of it but let me tell you the finish will come and that mighty capstone will come not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts when it comes to capping off the mysteries god didn't use a theologian to bring it he didn't unless he tried to shape it with his own hands are you with me for the capstone had to be a stone that was cut out without hands are you with me no theologian put his hand to it it wasn't man's ideas it came from the almighty god it came from the very thoughts of god this was not a man's portion this is a god portion and god is pouring out his fullness and opening up the word in his fullness showing light on things that were never seen before do you realize how blessed you are amen that light has now shown on things other ages did not we're not privy to and an understanding that has come you know who the seventh ages or or the seven churches represent as seven ages you know the names of the messengers is that right amen you know what the thunder's uttered you know now the seals have been revealed you know now the contents of the book you understand and you can see what predestination is others have that importion but we don't have it in portion others understood it in you know through a glass darkly but god is taking the veil off of it amen to reveal it and it's complete amen so you see again it was not by my might nor by power but it was by my spirit and my man's power didn't bring it man's understanding didn't bring it but it was by god's spirit and the same thing with the baptism of the holy ghost it wasn't man-made it wasn't shaking a hand of a preacher it wasn't joining a church it didn't come from a mental ascent to the message being true that's not how it came it didn't come by might it didn't come by men's thinking it was not a theologian amen but it was by my spirit saith the lord of hosts i'm captain of the people i'm bringing them to knowledge of the truth now so as we look at this this morning i want you to see that that again it will not be creeds of man that brings jesus christ back amen it won't be man's ideas or man's ways and man won't bring it theologians can't but by my spirit so to be an outpouring of the holy ghost that brings forth the dead in christ changes our body and causes a bride to be raptured but he'll bring forth the headstones thereof shouting with grace grace unto it it's a return to the land it's a calling out of egypt after sojourning in a strange land a land that is you know that is you see egypt was a land that was so different from the land of the apostles trying to get trying to make a parallel here amen follow my thinking as we you know don't let me throw you for a curve we know we know that egypt was never the land of the apostles but again that's where we were we were in spiritual bondage and man and god called us out where back to a land what land the land of the apostles the land of our fathers for israel it was abraham isaac and jacob for us it's the land of jesus peter paul james john are you with me this is the land that we have been returned to and and egypt was was a land of multiple gods and trinities of god where were three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of false prophets are you with me now anything that makes jesus less than god or secondary god is an unclean spirit amen but now we have returned and to do that god would send elijah the prophet now i want you to just place this here for a moment but i we're going to look at a couple of parallels because you know that moses and elijah will appear to the jews as the two witnesses amen but also we have seen we have seen the moses ministry and the elijah ministry you see his double grace somebody with me amen i want you to turn with him in malachi 4 and let's look at verse 4. let's just see not only does he speak of elijah he speaks of moses this is here before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord that's why those are wrong who thinks that that the two witnesses will be enoch and elijah because again malachi 4 specifically says moses and elijah but i want you to see it here malachi 4 4 remember ye the law of my of moses my servant which i commanded in the unto him in horeb for all of israel and with the statues and the judgment behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn remember our texts now return he shall turn the hearts of the fathers returning the hearts of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so did you notice verse 4 he says remember or think moses but i'm sending you elijah want you to think moses but it's elijah i'm sending and i'm sending you elijah for the return for the turning back of the heart to the faith of the fathers so there is to be by elijah a returning back of the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers and never forget god sending elijah is to turn our hearts back remember this is what he had to do with sarah turn her heart to believing amen now you know she started out as a young woman no doubt believing but as it went on she became less believing until she finally decided she couldn't do it let a hagar do it you see again then she got where she was past age and said it's totally impossible is that right she totally had lost her faith this was the condition of the church we had totally lost our faith amen but elijah returns us back to faith by the angel sarah's heart was turned back to believing again now as brother branham told us he said god promises church a spiritual a scriptural sign he said the resurrection would be reproduced jesus christ and his church would become so there would be one in the last days he promised it now we know that's true now he also promised there would be a restoring of the faith we read over jude earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints now we're promised in malachi 4 by the same system he always did which was a prophet that we would be restored back to the original faith oh my back to the original seed back to the seed like it began on the day of pentecost back to the same doctrine word by word power by power spirit this by the same thing just exactly like it was back in the beginning through signs and wonders of the living presence of jesus christ after 2 000 years he's still alive and he's the same yesterday today and forever so again think moses what was it about moses an angel appearing in a pillar of fire getting a commission not from an egyptian not from pharaoh not from the theologians but the commissioner prophet by an angel giving him a message a message to satan let my people go and a call to the elect come out of her my people that you be not partakers of our plagues oh church don't you know that call consummates in a bride leaving from here the plans are falling they're they're coming around we see pre-tribulation plagues already that are that have been bred in laboratories now released killing million now are you with me but i want to tell you before the plagues can strike there's got to be a people that are prepared to leave here they've heard a call they said cut out of her my people be separate saith the lord that you paid that you protect not plagues now those that are leaving egypt could say we're leaving the slavery of egypt there's not going to be no more weapons no more doing penance no more popes no more bishops no more false gods of the nile we're going to a land of freedom we're going back to the land and the god of our fathers we're going to the land of abraham isaac and jacob to a land that gushes flows grasses with milk and honey there's not just a little bit of this unlimited supply hallelujah amen so think moses but it won't be moses it'll be elijah and as elijah turned the hearts of the children of israel from following baal by being vindicated by a pillar of fire so will the last day elijah turn the hearts of the children back to the true and living god amen he'll not bring a new worship but he'll restore the old altar you remember when moses or excuse me when elijah there in that showdown he didn't go and build a new altar he returned to the altar he got the neglected stones of truth we don't have a message different from paul amen we've got the gospel of jesus christ it was as paul said it's my gospel the gospel of christ according to my gospel so if you'll see we have been returned back to the true gospel again look when when israel was in in this modern day was they were offered the land do you know they tried to get them to take the land of uganda so we'll settle you all there you know there's arabs there and they you know hittites and jebusites and all other kind of people wanting that land and they have vowed to keep you out of it but we'll just we'll just overrun uganda we'll give that to you and the jews can all settle in uganda there was no promise of god for uganda amen that was not their roots that was not their promised land and they had been given a promised land and it wasn't uganda it was it was a it was the land of zion it was a jerusalem it was it was a land of palestine and yet everybody was one to keep them from it but god swore i'm going to bring them back home and god has swore i'm bringing a pride back to her original place amen she she will be exactly in the land of her fathers not in the land of a stranger not in the land of uganda but the land of your fathers the land of paul the land of peter the land of james and john the place where jesus walked and all the old testament saints i'm bringing you back to that land now so elijah would not institute a new worship but he would restore the old altar he would be vindicated by a pillar of fire that that proved that this was no gimmicks no deception put barrels of water on the wood put it all over the sacrifice i want them to know this is no trickery and god would want you to know science themselves would have to validate the light struck the lens is that right over and over thousands upon thousands upon thousands of times it would the discernment would come to prove the word was among us amen what was it god was making you know this is no deception this is this is no gimmick am i put the water on the wood put it on the sacrifice this is no trickery and then visions were given to the prophet because he said i've done all of this at your command so he did it all by vision notice taking stones did you know in the old testament when they built an altar no man was able you know they could not put cut stones on the altar they had to be uncut stones somebody with me the reason why a man's hand could not tool it every revelation that goes in our worship cannot be tooled by man it can't come from seminaries it has to come from just saith the lord amen it'll be exactly as i made it amen now turn with me to first kings 18 and verse 36 now and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice notice is evening time in the last days when elijah comes that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things that thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art god and that thou has turned their heart back again you see as elijah turns the hearts back they were they were all following baal but they're coming of the ministry of elijah's turn our hearts back to the original faith come back to that with that they may know thou art the lord god and that thou hast turn their heart back again and then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god notice it comes back around they begin to know who the true and living god is amen the creeds are gone baal is gone every other god's out of the picture baptist gods methodist gods presbyterian gods all out of the picture [Music] amen because why elijah by a pillar of fire turned their hearts back again now unfortunately israel would rebel time and time again until finally they rejected and crucified their messiah their savior and at last they were dispersed among the nations but now we see a return of them after 2 000 years back to their homeland and similarly the the church has rebelled and fallen away until she's been dispersed among the denominations but i want you to know the return of israel shows a great parallel between the natural seed the nation of israel and the royal seed the bride of christ what god has done for the natural seed in reestablishing them in the land he's also doing for the royal seed amen and neither can be blessed outside of their promised land if you want to be blessed get back in the promised land amen it's only there we can be blessed and when they brought them there from the babylonian dispersal back to israel zechariah 13 1 prophesies in that day there shall be a fountain opened amen to the house of david to the inhabitants of jerusalem for your unbelief and your uncleanness amen what is a fountain opened not a cistern found we we found the cistern of of um hezekiah we found the cisterns of one of the kings or we found the cisterns and the baptists and the methodists where they stored water and they become leaky vessels and they're all out or what's there is stagnated amen but here when he comes back to your land a fountain is open and that's what i want to get to you today there's been a fountain open a fountain of an unlimited supply it can't run out you don't have to pump it up amen you don't have to sweat and and toil to get it it's there it's for you to drink from it's there to to give you what you need in the hour whether it's sin and for uncleanness whatever it is the washing of the water of the word will cleanse you from unbelief now when god puts his spirit in you it's a flowing fountain now i want you to remember they go to physical land your land is the holy ghost your land is the holy ghost so everything in the holy ghost whether it's the bible the word the bible the truth or whatever it is whether it's healing deliverance whatever is all in the holy ghost so your land is the holy ghost the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but it's righteousness peace and joy where in the holy ghost so there's it in that land is where we find righteousness peace and joy outside that land we're not blessed and you will never be blessed until you come fully into the baptism of the holy ghost now but notice in jeremiah chapter 2 and verse 13 can you put that up for me please jeremiah 2 verse 13 for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me here's the two evils now they forsaken me the fountain of living waters now look how he identifies himself he said i am not just water i'm living water flowing water and i'm a fountain it gushes out goodness mercy healing deliverance all comes from him and he said you forsake me the fountain of living water and you viewed out here's a second sin you've hewed out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water and this is the era of denomination today they've chewed out their cisterns where they used to have revival but it's all leaked out and the revival is gone amen but god didn't give us another sister i want you to get the stock here it flows it flows it's he is a fountain of living water there's no little flow out of it it's unlimited amen notice in jeremiah 17 verse 13 and he says oh lord the hope of israel all that for safety shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the lord the fountain of living waters again he's showing the fountain of living waters this is me the lord and then we find what comes out of that fountain heal me o lord and i will be healed save me and i will be saved for thou art my praise this is what comes out of the fountain healing for the body and healing for the soul hallelujah amen so he said i'm the fountain and they've forsaken me but he said if you'll turn back to god if your heart had turned back you'll find heal in there you'll find salvation there now zechariah 14 and verse 6 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear or dark zechariah 14 7 but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass at the evening time it shall be light can you place yourself right there right now how many nodes we're in the evening light amen it's a time of darkness but light comes upon the word so brother tim well why don't you understand everything that's happening in the world today because the light's on the word it's not on politics amen it's not it's not on it's not on your 401k and the future of your of your finances that's not where the light is the light is on the word in the evening like a time it shall be light notice now the next verse and it shall be on that day in the evening time that living water shall go out of jerusalem hallelujah now remember the bride she is the spirits of jerusalem out of her will go what living waters there's going to be an abundant supply flowing out of her amen and half of them toward the former sea half of toward the henderson the summer and the winter shall be it won't matter if it's cold it won't matter if it's hot it don't matter if this is have revival and that one age amen it'll always be the same amen the living water shall grow out from jerusalem hallelujah out of this bride out of this people is going to come living waters not a stagnant stream not something with wiggle tails or something that was yesterday but not today amen but something i live in waters and the lord shall be king remember was preaching on the rejected king the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day there shall be one lord and his name won now jesus let it be known he was the giver of that water the woman at the well the woman that had six husbands or six men or five men and one was not her husband so six men and now she meets the seventh so when she comes to the seventh come on she mates the one who gives her the answer for the thirst in her life hallelujah amen he has living waters john 14 10 jesus answered said in her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink that would have asked of him and he would have given me living water not a stagnant pool living water not a dried up cistern where it leaked out years and years ago living water i've come to give living water now let's turn to john 7 verse 37 in the last days and the great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirsts let him come to me and drink if you're thirsty come to me he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water notice again a flow an abundance this is not a trickle again you know it's not saying if you believe on me as the scripture has said out of you will come a trickle he said it'll be a river an unstoppable river it's an unstoppable fountain there's not a little bit of it it flows but this he spoke of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because jesus was not yet glorified so again it is the lamb that leads to living waters it is him that gives living waters that's what he wants the church to have is a flowing fountain now ezekiel 37 11. i'd like to just look at here because as they're coming back there are prophecies laying in the bible for their return and so there are prophecies laying there for our return the bible prophesied that even as israel would return to their land we will return to our land are you with me so in ezekiel 37 11 he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried our hope is lost we're cut off from our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them just sayeth the lord behold o my people i will open your graves and i will come cause you to come out of your graves and bring you to the land of israel so you see the jews were brought out of the nations of bride from denomination but god said it's a resurrection i'm actually resurrecting a people bringing them to their land and you shall know i'm the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you out of your graves and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and i shall place you in your own land and you will know that i the lord has spoken it and performed it saith the lord remember israel's over there against all odds it looked impossible amen now in the in the rise of the sun brother branham talks about the brightest for the bright age it would be a resurrection out of dark denominationalism so what is it was god opening the graves and bringing the people to the land amen sometimes you know you you young people don't understand maybe even what we're talking about because you never were there but we were there we know what the slave belt feels like we know the whippings we understand the the humiliation the persecution we understand we were misfits amen we understand we were in a grave we were dying amen but god has brought a resurrection out of dark denominationalism back to the land i'll open up the graves and i'll bring you back to your land now so the bride has returned to the home land of the holy ghost brother branham told him in recognizing your day in this message israel back in her promised land she didn't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there why national force put her in her place and he said i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national forest will put the church in the world council of churches yes and we can already see national force coming down amen as the antichrist rises its power we feel it right now today you know that amen but i want you to know it's not national force that puts the bride in her homeland it's the power of god that puts the bride in her homeland and you see because we'll recognize our position and the word in that land and she is in christ and that that will put in a place no national force will do it i'm telling you the pressures you are under is not going to put you in your place people are looking for a squeeze to put them in their place it won't do it amen you say well the pressures brother tim they're getting worse and worse but i'll tell you friends there's another pressure there's another pressure it's the pressure of the holy ghost and it is pushing and pressing of all the people in this hour you've got to get ready to leave from here i'm taking you even beyond the land of the bible into the land of the promised land of the resurrection and the rapture into glory more than just a theology am i returning you to remember i'm giving you a double portion amen yes i'm restoring the word but more than the word i'm taking you physically don't you realize that the for the real capstone of the holy ghost will be taken a bride physically in a rapture a sweep of the holy ghost coming over them that's why you got to have the sweep now to change you now so that you'll be a part of the sweep then we're people who have returned to the land of the bible after six church ages of dispersal removal from the land by paul's gospel the church was rooted firmly in the land of the bible with correct bible doctrines and the power of the holy ghost and as the ephesian church lost their first love believers then would become dispersed among the denominations and they've been out of their homeland now for thousands of years but at this date there's been a call that has rung out come out of her my people this is a midnight cry amen light your lamps get ready the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him this is the third exodus where god has sent us to moses to deliver the people of israel from egypt vindicating him with a pillar of fire and that same god has sent a prophet with a message saying let my people go and we're here in the land having returned to the gospel that paul preached i want you to know where we're at we're not in a strange land we're not over in uganda somewhere we have been returned back to our land the gospel paul preached amen you say well well we got something different from old paul well i'll tell you what you can have your uganda amen i don't want a different gospel or a different land because of this we have returned to the god of the bible in this land we will keep his commandments we will have no other gods besides him amen even the idols of television and hollywood have been abandoned with a pledge to serve the one true and living god amen true believers don't go to movies you didn't get that let me say it again true believers don't go to movies real believers don't wallow like pigs with the world and go to their ball games you might attract leo to seeing with ball games but not the bride make no mistake about it we we've got a safe place for for our children to play but that ain't about attracting people here we attract people by the gospel of jesus christ by the outpouring of the holy ghost amen the bride's heroes is not someone who can chase a pigskin amen a pigskin that's just full of air and when or when a gold medal at the olympics that is not our heroes our heroes are men who can kill a giant with a stone that lions cannot eat that fire cannot burn amen who fed through faith subdued kingdoms and wrought righteousness and obtained promises and stopped the mouth of lions who quenched the violence of the fire who escaped the edge of the sword who out of weakness were made strong who watched violet in flight and who turned the flight to armies of the aliens that's our heroes our heroes are abraham isaac jacob david peter paul james john jesus amen all the way down to the seven ages these are the heroes our heroes amen now we have returned to the land of milk and honey and it's it's a wonderful land like in the days of joshua of old you remember that walked around the walls of silence but now we've seen the silence that the seventh seal held and now is broken amen and the land is open to us it's open for the believer every resource of the book now this is granted us untapped resources i'm trying to get something to you it flows and there there are resources that you have not yet tapped into now just because i i i got a little sore throat yesterday don't mean you got to sit down on me you got to help me a little bit amen now let's listen this this this has granted us untapped resources no you don't have to cover your face and run i'm not sick now you see we have untapped resources just as israel had to conquer the land before before them and after seeing the walls fell you know after the seals is open that's only the beginning that we understand the seals and the mystery that's only the beginning there's more in the land amen now the third pull that third phase of brother brandon's ministry that opened the seven seals opened up the entire word of god it was based on a scripture that we are going to have to make our scripture i want you to see it mark 11 23 this is the scripture for this this word that we have received the message mark 11 23 for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire how many's got things you desire all right so he's saying when you pray you believe that you receive them and you shall have them no exceptions no deals no clauses no buts no ifs amen but what you when you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them that's the message of the third pull you say brother tim i believe the mystery believe this mystery amen because this is what the third poll was based on this scripture right here amen the third poll opened up the seven seals of brother tiff we're to be studious and and learned and scholars and and understanders of of the bible and whatever well understand the scripture we are people who stand under the blood covenant amen the blood of the everlasting covenant a people that through the atonement sanctified by the blood of jesus christ can live in such a sphere with god so close that he can be wrapped so completely and god by the blood of jesus that it wouldn't be him talking it would be the holy spirit speaking these things now the original root of the bride tree has put forth another branch i want you to say we are a branch of the original root we have not been grafted in we have been born in the original vine we're not a sprout that it was put in by luther or wesley or pentecost we are not a grafted vine we are the vine the original vine pudding for the branch amen in other words we are then a continuation of the root of the book of acts amen we are not a continuation of her faces of her debates of our arguments or the heresies of our false doctrines but we are continuation of the same holy spirit that worked in the church of people who are now doing his acts again if you abide in me if you dwell in the land and the god of the land dwell in you the holy ghost in you then ask what you will see we receive the seals that open up the land of the book but we're to go into we are to go into full redemption listen in the queen of sheba brother branham said instead of people advancing on and seeing what god promised we look back and see what some brother behind us said let's don't look back let's look forward let's keep moving on and on we have untapped resources jesus said mark 11 23 why if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said it shall come to pass you can have what you said no conditions it's just unlimited whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them now you say brother branham what if we ask for somebody's life to be taken or some evil thing he said you can have a christian faith for doing the thing like that it takes a christian spirit to ask christian things to receive things from christ but he said when a spirit-born spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart places it upon his lips what that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man i'm talking to that people that satan cannot stand before amen again he said in the early church he said the sick were healed the devils were cast out they spoke with new tongues that was the word in action that word is never failed in the mouths of believing christians and in this last age how many wants to know about the last days now it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bright not less more a double portion now moses in the first exodus by a commission under the blood of bulls and goat he began to torment satan's kingdom amen think of it amen say him time after time let my people go if you don't let them go i'll bring another plague on you we're going to plague the devil don't you get it we're going to plague the devil till we leave from here until he has to let us go amen satan you see pharaoh got stubborn but the more stubborn he became the more determined god was to have israel his firstborn serve him uninhibited don't try to inhibit us don't try to limit us amen we will have praise we will have worship we'll have the holy ghost we'll have every divine promise we'll have the mysteries we'll have every truth in the bible we will not shirk back from one thing it's all ours let my people go i won't do it okay then i'll plague you till you do and god used the voice of a man to bring plagues on satan's kingdom and now god wants to use your voice satan you have no right to my body i am a temple of the holy ghost you have no right to my children you have no right to my family i'm a child of the most high god amen i'm not standing still i'll call down heaven and the plagues from heaven until you let them go amen we will not stand still we've got a land to go to [Applause] we have a rapture in this hour we believe for the impossible and god will use the voice of a man to to bring plagues upon satan's kingdom and just a little more sound up here now so god hiding revealing himself in simplicity this is what brother adam told us god wouldn't be seen out there god would be hidden in simplicity he'd be hidden in a people he would be hidden in a in a little man that's had a stuttering speech in the days of moses somebody help me amen he would be hidden in him he would be hidden in a rod which would represent the name of jesus it didn't look like much but it availed much your prayers may not look like much but they avail much do you hear what i'm saying amen there was a story of a man um that had a real um near-death experience and i won't tell it all but unless he he went to hell he was not a believer and when he when he died and he he went and and descended way down down down miles there and as he did they began to pull on him and torment him and kick him and whatever and bite him and fight him and everything and he said i was you know i've been a football player as a kid and i knew how to handle myself and i was hitting back and whatever else but there was hundreds of them thousands of them coming against me in this dark place and he said they left me until i was just uh just a a heap on the floor my eyes were gone my eyeballs pulled out my ears pulled off they had bit me and tore me and tormented me and hurt me until i was nothing but just a piece of humanity on the floor he said i was i was like something from a sewer my life wretched and he said in that moment he began to he something began to say to him pray and he said i don't believe in prayer i don't believe in prayer whatsoever i'm an atheist and i don't believe in prayer i'll tell you you'll believe in that place and remember this man got to come back he only was able to see this amen but he got to come back to life again and it changed his life but there in that midst there he said in a heap broken hurting pain like you never felt he said i began they began to begin to say something from inside of me pray and he said i don't know i don't know how to pray and he said well pray and he said i i don't know how he said something from way back from his childhood come come to him and he began to say god bless america you know my country tis of thee and all kinds of things that he would say you know come to his mind about god anything that had god in it he noticed every time that he spoke the name jesus or god he said the demons would run screaming and they would scream but they wouldn't come closer they would they would back away from him every time that he would mention it and he said there in that horrible condition he said i i there was a hope and he said i i had something down on the inside of me that began to hope that jesus loved me he said why would he love me i've never done him for him i turned him away i've not believed in him but he said if there was ever time i wanted to believe jesus loved me i wanted to believe it then and he said i i began to say jesus loves me and then he said jesus come to me and he said i wanted to believe he would come and he said all of a sudden i saw a light it was so tiny but it began to advance toward me and become greater and greater and greater and he picked me up in his arms and he loved me and then he took i told him and took him from there as he took all his hurts away and replaced his eyeballs and his ears all the hurting that he had been through took him there and moved him into that dimension of heaven and he spoke about those things but nevertheless in the thing what i want to get to you this man he saw first hand well you know where just the name of jesus just speaking of god caused demons to move back in that round i don't think the believer realizes the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man amen the power that is there that is unleashed when you call on the name of jesus demons have to go haven't we seen it haven't we seen demons bow to it haven't we seen them cast out in the name of jesus christ why because the effectual fervent prayer releases the name of jesus and the power to make devils flee i'll tell you there's enough power in there to heal your cancer to heal your diseases to heal your sickness to heal your soul sickness there's enough power to go out and find your loved ones and bring them home and restore your family there's enough power and when the saints of god begin to release the unlimited power of jesus hallelujah that's what i'm talking about there's power things you've never tapped into that you don't realize because the devil wants to make you think your prayers are going nowhere where all the time they're pushing him back and pushing him back and making him flee isn't that the bible submit yourself therefore to god resist the devil and he shall flee from you moses standing under the blood of bulls and goats walked out there reached toward the east and said dust said the lord let there come flies they've never been fly never heard a fly he didn't even see a fly he just spoke it amen and it was expressed doubts released from his lips a simple man with the blood of bulls and goats first thing you know here comes a little fly the next thing you know there are five pounds per yard you know again it was the word of god spoken through moses do you hear what was saying think moses remember moses i'm turning you back to an unlimited supply there's no limit in this it flows with milk and honey amen and he said if he said under the blood he stand in the presence of god his words was in his own words if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will it shall be given to you where is the church standing at i want to ask you something the blood of bulls and goats uh could be used for bleach we can only cover could put a man in position to speak the creative word of god and bring flies into existence why would you stumble at the bleach of jesus christ's blood who can speak a squirrel or something into existence amen don't do it don't stumble over simplicity believe he still remains god if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said again you say i believe the third pull brother brother tim we're in the third pool this is the scripture of the third pull amen and he says where is the pentecostal church today at today said you don't realize that truly confess sin omits sins and it builds a bridge across the council and takes a man back in the presence of the creator and makes him a son of god let me tell you even more it takes away the castle where there's not even a remembrance that you were ever on the other side that you ever was a sinner hallelujah as far as he issues from the west god has removed your sins your unbelief from you now he said god taking a humble center cleansing him by his blood dropping him in that con that confessed sin into that clorox bleach of the blood of the son of god putting his own life into that man by the baptism of the holy ghost then if we have the genuine baptism of the holy ghost what's wrong with us when the type when elijah dropped the road for elisha he got a double portion of it jesus said the works that i do shall you shall do also and greater than this shall you do for i go to my father what's wrong church now brother branham is asking what is wrong well you see the the lutherans were too happy just with having their sins forgiven to go on they left out a whole much more of the bible and a lot of it they never possessed amen wesley was too happy with holiness that he didn't go on into the holy ghost you see azusa street went into speaking in tongues and they were too happy with the gift of the spirit they didn't even get the the gift himself the holy ghost amen but i want you to understand god's asking the same question what's wrong with the church where are we standing this is not another denominational church where you just sit back on your pew and socialize and join up but this is a day where people who know their god will do exploits who will take all the land you see in the first exodus the people of the book use inspired words uttered from human lips and it created frogs and lice and locusts now they weren't playing games they were tormenting devils is that right they were calling the elements come torment satan we have been tormented we have been whipped we have been beat we have been enslaved we have been in bondage but no more right now we are starting to declare our freedom and in declaring our freedom we are bringing curses upon satan's kingdom amen we are bombarded satan's kingdom confessing the word by his stripes i am healed in the name of jesus christ hold in our our profession come on amen they in their household shall be saved they will be there in their offsprings with them every scripture that there is in the bible you bombard satan's kingdom you bomb him hallelujah and if the first bomb don't get him you drop another into the same place and if that don't get it you do it and you pound it till it gets through until you flatten him till it's no longer standing before you now god's word it said to the seed of abraham they would return to the land of abraham and nothing could stop him and i'm just saying nothing can stop us you know the tables had turned after being beaten despised suppressed now the israelites moses was the oppressor amen and they were unstoppable the bible said they went out with a high hand and when the red sea got in their way too bad you got to move you got to open up we've got our inheritance on the other side of the red sea and the devil's trying to block us here but we'll go right through your block it don't matter how big it is we got a message and that message said go forward i'm sick with cancer go forward amen well i got this problem go forward hey my my children brother go forward whatever it is you don't quit you don't stop you go forward you persevere you press on every example of the bible shows the resources of this milk and honey and the sun limited none of the book remains closed we are not a people who have six seals open and the seventh remains on we're not a people of a closed book we're a people of the open book every bit of it is accessible now brother branham told us if you can limit god you can limit christ and if you can limit the church today in this possibilities you're limiting god but all things are possible whatsoever you desire when you pray you believe you receive it and you shall have it he said i believe it and i know it i know it's the truth now it provokes god somebody with me it provokes god to limit him it makes him angry it depletes displeases god look at psalms 78 and 40. how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy how he wrought his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field of zoan which is which is where pharaoh's house was you see they didn't remember they forgot in their trials what god did and they limited god and this is the way we do so often we get into a trial and we start limiting god amen and when we do it provokes him it grieves him amen now god is known by simple faith by the baptism of the holy ghost that's the only way god in you and you become a son of god it changes your nature and the very same thing god the creator who made all things spoke and the world into existence by his word and that same spirit in you you believe everything god says and there's nothing impossible if you believe it you won't stand back to one little creed and say i don't believe except that i i can't believe god will do this i can't believe you limit god by your unbelief amen now he said if god loved you well enough to bring you up out of sin and fill you with the holy ghost is that you what's the matter with you poor spineless weaklings around the country won't he much more deliver you from your affliction when he promised he would do it well i'm past my three scoring tent you can give any kind of excuse you want to but god is unlimited you are limited because of your age but age didn't limit god with abraham it didn't limit him with sarah come on church it didn't limit him with simeon it didn't limit him with ammo amen we should not allow our our thinking to limit god our excuses the devil's trying to hide you back and tell you you're a little trot down something you are not you are sons and daughters of god amen we're not a defeated people we're an overcoming people i'm my deity he said is not just in heaven deities in you do you realize brother branham taught us that god is here not just coming we always want to put in the future one day you know when jesus comes but remember god has always been here on the earth god has never left the earth listen this this is brother branham's word god has never left the earth if he'd ever leave the earth i don't know what would become of it but god's always been here in some form oh praise his name and he was with the children of israel in the in the wilderness coming out of egypt in the form of the light he spoke to abraham in the former man he spoke to moses in the form of a man he spoke to the church in the form of a man his son christ jesus and he's speaking through his church today through the anointed church of the living god through vessels of clay we are the branches you are the branches i am the vine god is still speaking and the world sees jesus as you present him so you see again this is what he is god is here on the earth today where is he he's in bright form he's in his people he's in this church this morning he hasn't abandoned his project he hadn't sent a prophet and then went back in the heavens and forgot it all he may have taken his man but he didn't take his spirit somebody help me preach and brother branham tells us where we're standing in invisible union he said can you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the grain that went in the ground the same jesus in bright form same power same church same thing same word hallelujah amen so here we are the complete body of jesus christ revealed in the form of the bride that was taken out of his side amen in the message token as a husband and a woman and her husband become one so does the bride in christ become one the ministry of the pride and the ministry of christ is the same the vindicated word in his body is this very victory in the reason of his death he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell his and when and preached to the souls in prison his flesh died then he raised it up again and quickened it quicken means he made it alive his flesh which is his body and that's the word has been laying dead for years but gradually come up in the reformation now she's standing on her feet now where's the church standing at on her feet an invincible army with unlimited resource with powerful weapons the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds that is our weapon amen so you there again a mighty army raised up marching towards zion taking every promise not backing up from any brother branham said that you know when when the dry bones lived he said that that word can only come through a prophet how can prophecy come only to the prophet you say well brother tim you see that it was only through the prophet there are still prophets let me make it clear there is not a four-fold ministry there is a five-fold ministry and a prophet is a new testament preacher now of course we know that there's only one prophet messenger is that right amen there's only one major prophet messenger will reveal the mysteries that's contained in the word and has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers so there's one prophet messenger of the age amen so there's no eighth messengers amen there's no eight h but there are still prophets there are new testament preachers amen you know why the ministry is being attacked today satan has effectively destroyed prophecy in the church and preaching is the testimony of jesus christ which is the spirit of prophecy or you hear me when a man stands behind the pulpit brother adam said he has more authority than the angels in heaven [Music] when he's given forth the word and coming by inspiration it's more than the man it's the power of god behind those words moses might have been the vessel that spoke it and it might have been a man's words or the man's lips that formed the word but god got behind those words and created amen i want you to know there is an invincible army that has raised up marching to take every square inch of the word that speaks of the bride we will have everything that god promised we will believe all the word we will have holiness amen for without that no man will seek the lord amen we will have the holy ghost we will see miracles we will have speaking in tongues we will have prophecy we will have word of knowledge we will have mystery truths amen we are back in the land and we have been planted here by predestination in egypt that was in our land and we were not planted there it was only a temporary place but here is not temporary in this land we're never leaving it we are in this land for good and we're taking possession of it like he told joshua every place to your souls of your feet stand upon i have given that to you and i'll tell you it's time for you to expand your borders and to realize this is unlimited and whatever you've had here to avoid god's got more for you amen i'll give it to you yeah you're gonna have to fight to possess it yeah there's demons on it yeah there's giants there but i don't see the giants and i don't see the demons i see a divine promise and we are more than able to take the land and man we're more than able to receive every divine promise god said i gave it to you now you're going to take it and i'm telling you go forward i'm telling you as a children of god there is more for your inheritance more than you've ever experienced hallelujah you have not yet to understand the depths of the joys and the love and the peace and the power of god [Applause] it's for you to take and it's not a little bit amen it's a place that flows it gussets forth it's a river of living water it's not just a mustard seed faith it's a rapture and faith they may have had mustard seed in other days but brother branham told us don't you limit your faith to mustard seed some little bitty faith our faith is beyond that it's double grace it's double the faith amen it's not all his faith for salvation is faith for the change of the body amen you can never exhaust god's love and mercy so well i don't want to bother god god wants to be bothered amen don't ever think you get asked too much of god amen you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not god wants you to ask amen he wants you to believe that our joys can be full he don't want to limit your faith to some little mustard seed faith he wants you to get out there in the into some other kind of faith and move out to big things amen that ought to be what we say for this new year i'm going to get new heights i'm going to have new joys i'm going to have bigger faith we're going to have more healers we're going to see more devils cast out we're going to see more salvation we are not stuck we're going to have more worship amen you see the south the boy wait do you see a shout this time amen because devil portion is being poured out not a little bit you see this rejoice in the past wait until you see us rejoice over this hallelujah we're not limited to some little thing we have every promise of god's word amen that it's gushing for us it's a river of living water it's not a little bit it's a great supply it's unlimited it's inexhaustible big things are just as easy to see those little things and then you can have bad things don't just ask for little things that's big i'm asking big things for this year i'm asking big things for this church i'm asking big things for my ministry i'm asking big things for my anointing i'm asking big things i'm expecting greater things i'm not thinking we're going to get weaker hey man i'm thinking we're going to get stronger oh man we just now begin to fight we just started out amen satan you ain't seen nothing yet because we're coming in the name of the lord god of israel we know what a slingshot of faith with just one letter of his name will do it'll bring down the time wait till we release the rest of it [Applause] you see we didn't just get out one stone we got five stones we got all of jesus [Applause] hallelujah oh yes it's inexhaustible like a little fish in the ocean let me tell you you're like a little fish in the ocean of god's spirit could a little fish that long drink up all the ocean not in a million lifetimes amen neither can you exhaust god amen we're a little fish in the ocean of god's spirit amen we are in it it is in us you ever think about that the fish is in the water and the water's in the fish amen we're in the spirit and the spirit's in us we're surrounded you may think i'm surrounded [Applause] you think they think the enemy's got us closed in you may think we're surrounded but i'm surrounded by him i'm in the water the water's in me and he said if you are in the word the word is in you ask what you will hallelujah amen why the spirit lives in you the life of the fish is the life in the ocean we are life in the spirit you take a fish out of the ocean it dies you take the holy spirit out we die amen the spirit is our life it is our freedom you see for the fish the ocean is its freedom it can swim anywhere it can go anywhere it has all kinds of depths come on it can it it is its freedom you take it out you can only just flop there on the ground can't go anywhere the spirit is our life it is our freedom you may think oh just take the the spirit out of the church no it's our freedom amen everywhere a fish goes is the ocean everywhere a child that goes the child of god goes as a spirit we are in it it's in us he can never leave us or forsake us hallelujah imagine a little mouse you know there in the corners of egypt saying i better eat only one grain a day this year because i'm gonna run out no he couldn't ever run out in a million lifetimes he couldn't run out so don't be afraid to ask god for anything he's willing more willing to give it than you are to receive it if we can just get that little shadow wiped away to know he's willing to do it i'm trying to tell you friends heaven has moved the lamb took the book and it flows on an open book it's all open an unlimited supply not a parcel part we're in the days of abundance i can hear the sound of abundance of rain come on church amen we're not just looking for a little bit we're looking for more and for more god wants to give good things to you the strain of fatherhood of your of a parent to your children comes from god god loves his children he tells them he loves them because he's a true father a true father will tell them that he loves his kid he expresses that love it comes from a well of love they can never run out amen even you with lost children you feel that same way about your kid you don't want to see them perish and god was not willing that any should perish but all would have eternal life amen god wants his people delivered he wants you to enjoy all his blessings amen oh my he spoke about a fruit tree a church should be like a tree planted by the rivers of water the rivers of living water amen i just stuck out in some dry place but rooted in an unlimited supply and when the when the summer comes his leaf does not wither when drought comes his leak does not wither when there's tough times his leaf does not with he bringeth forth fruit in its season why he's got an unlimited supply amen oh my this is this is the word of god and what do you do you just drink and you push out and you drink and you push out but you got to push you got to drink more than your allotted portion people just take a sip and do their little religion and that's all they care about but you got to drink more than you're a lot of portion you can believe it believe it or not i'm trying to quit but you know here's the thing i've got an unlimited supply hallelujah i got a i got tapped into oil it keeps pushing out amen get planted in the good soil of god's word and then tap into the the spirit of god and just push out oh man the sun shines and you push out toward the light amen and you push out leaves and you push out blossoms and you push out fruit you reach to the heavens the heavens is unlimited for you are you with me amen but you've got to come and drink what good is an unlimited supply if you're not drinking you've got to drink you got to drink more than your portion you see the devil don't care how much you come as long as you don't drink you let some kind of critical spirit but you know stop you a critical evil spirit music's too loud i don't like their song selection preacher's too long not enough entertainment anyway he didn't tell enough jokes to keep my attention wednesday night and that you know and then that long service on sunday that's a bit too much and first thing you know you're critical and you've got stickers coming out of you yeah because you've been in a desert place but yeah that ain't where you belong the children don't belong in a desert place they belong by rivers of living waters where there's unlimited resource and you have to drink more than you're then you're just enough to sustain you amen even in church you got to get where you don't fill up quickly amen that you've got a big capacity for the word of god one sign that you're not adopted is that your your little you got come with a little jug and it gets filled up real quick amen well let me tell you it's got to be like david my cup run is over hey man i get filled with my cup hey man and it's getting down in my saucer and it's overflowing from my saucer and it's enough honey amen that the little bears can come along and those that's needy come on everybody around you can see you've been in the presence of god hallelujah not a sermon that by preacher yet that just makes christianettes there's too many little fish they're not rainbow trouts some of you don't know where i'm at the third pulled vision told brother branham he could catch that that trout but there was others that were just for the entertainment and when he went into the next poll it scattered him i don't want to be scattered i want to be pulled into his presence amen everything's in us right now we are now tapped into it i'm bringing this down to close now let me tell you there's enough pressure in this flow that it says if all the waters of the world were stacked upon a four foot pipe and the pressure of that trying to get out and that's the way the pressure of god is trying to find just a crevice if you push through looking for somebody that'll yield herself and just let it push through amen because if he can get just a little stream that stream will grow into a bigger one and then it'll go into a bigger one and first thing you know there'll be a huge flow of the divine love of god and a rapture will take place that's where we're at friend we're in the age of a rapture it's adoption age where we're here in the manifestations of the sons of god we're we're not something different but we are him amen he said but i can't overcome oh yes you can because greater is he that is in you more is he that is in you than he that's in the world amen now god wants to do more than even you drinking milk he wants to get you to meet yes those that are mature and of strong and a strong age full age that they they the meat belongeth to them so we're here in the day and the hour where we're in the moment where the untapped resources of god's blessings are with us and we can have every promise of god now i'm telling you church we have just started that's right we have just began to tap in we are just barely scraping the surface i have prophesied from this pulpit many times but there's more and greater prophecies coming forth do you hear what i'm saying amen i have prophesied i have prophesied and prodigals have returned i have prophesied when miriam was dancing the cancer was dead i have prophesied standing in a hospital room and a waiting room there and saying she'll be in the in the icy room tonight she'll be in a regular room tomorrow night and the next night she'll be in on a bed do you know what a miracle that was that was a huge miracle amen what was it it was prophecy it was the words being spoke by inspiration i've been i have stood by the side of a man who was brain-dead is somebody with me amen that i drove hours 17 18 hours to get to his side and walk in there and there and there i come in there and i say i have not come to anoint you for death i have come to anoint you for life [Applause] hallelujah and i saw a man that was brain dead rise up to preach again and i want to say he's still the same god this morning oh man he'll raise him up again and again and again you understand where we're standing we're in the moment we're in a moment of time a man with a little young teenage girl could drive down a stake make a claim for her brother and before the service was over the holy spirit awakened her wayward brother justin and got him out of bed and he drove to church in his pajamas staggered in the door came to the lord that's been six years ago and he's still serving the lord let me just tell you some people want to criticize and say this is just emotion and say that's all it is well i tell you it lasts when i've tapped into it it's the last i've been preaching now 52 years and it still hadn't dimmed down i hadn't gotten weaker i've got stronger i'm not less of a christian i'm more of the alpha amen amen here this man came staggering down an altar one day his life has never changed are you with me he's never went back i can go over this congregation and i can say about you and you and you and you and you and you and you it's more than emotion it's a life it's the power of god and the salvation hallelujah a god that could take a jailbird like george winters and make a child of god out of him put him as a deacon in the church send him forth in his name i'm talking about it last it's not some there's not some flash in the pan it's something that lasts [Applause] we've got too many witnesses you said well this one tried and he quit and this well some didn't go far enough but i've seen some even in our youth camp that didn't go far enough can i preach just a minute can i just tell you just a moment i saw a couple of boys that come to our camp three of them actually mcgary boys every one of them wayward backs not backslidden they never slid anywhere they never went forward they were rebellious young men didn't want to be at camp gave their mother a hard time on the way man you know it was a torture to bring them and there was a torture when we got them they aggravated everybody and everything and broke every kind of rule and to the point that i had to take one of those young men two of those young men and sent them off the campground with their mother it's a shame i'd have to do that but i did amen but they don't hate me today they love me for it davey jr here the one brought up whirly girlfriend with her with her and they're dope to camp and things that was wrong and running out in the woods and doing things and we're chasing them and all kinds of things in rebellious ways and take him send them off to campground and said okay you can come to church but you can't you can't stay on the grounds and david junior comes through the prayer line now his hard heart had been cracked and opened a little because he realized the shame that he'd brought his mother and his daddy and all this and he was ashamed of himself and he got just a little bit tender and at the end he began to hope that he could get right with god and he comes through the prayer line and there in the prayer line god delivers him amen and and then you know it was infectious it was infectious in here a few months later his brother aaron because of his witness and his testimony and his change he comes to the lord and dave mcgary calls me up brother david he calls me up and said brother tim i want you to come and i want you to preach for me well i'd never preach for him but i want you to preach for me i said brother david i you know i i don't know that you need me he said yes i do my boys love you and they want you to come preach and i believe you can be a blessing to them and i go to his home and karen and i stay in his home there davey is with spoken word books in his backpack sharing the message at school and it's he's so sweet and so tender and so in love with jesus that i sit there and i weep as i watch and i see for myself the transforming power of one minute in god's presence and it was more than emotion it was life-changing amen and he had found an unlimited supply amen and it infected his brother and the next thing you know you know airlines is sitting there are true and aaron's sharing with me his love for the lord and what god's done for him and i'm sitting there i am just overwhelmed amen at the grace upon grace amen listen i know grace i've experienced grace and i've seen grace in action and i know what grace will do it can take the violence center and make them clean it can wash them whiter than the snow it can reach out to your lost loved ones even as rebellious and evil as they are and turn their lives around that's grace that's the grace that comes with the capstone are you with me church and there there i preached to them that weekend and i rejoice in what god was done but there was matthew still out there shoplifting still out there doing stupid things and partying and whatever smoking his pot and doing his thing there was matthew still out there but you see god didn't give up on him goodness and mercy was on his trail do you realize when you release good and mercy goodness and mercy it gets on the trail of your loved ones hallelujah are you with me somebody with me and it began to there get on matthew's trail and there he got in trouble with the law and different things that was going on in his life and his life was a mess and there in his room on his knees he surrenders to god and he walks down the stairs and as he goes down the stairs the devil says to him but i still got you i still have you you see you got that television in your room your parents let you have to keep you at home and i still got you and it put such a rage in matthew he screamed out screamed

panic you know thought his brothers had aggravated him and he was gonna hit him with a with bow cutters and he runs to his room and he beats that television to smithereens and there's no going back now he preaches the gospel now he's blessed us in this church amen what we have unlimited mercy we have unlimited grace and there's unlimited power hallelujah i'll tell you what it's your time it's your time to confess your promise it's your time to parade around the building and rejoice it's your time to pray proclaim power over the enemy it's your time to speak the word for your loved one it's your time it's not too far it's not too hard it's not too big it's not impossible stand to your feet hallelujah [Applause] yes [Applause] [Music] hallelujah you hear the lord speaking through his handmaid right there we are more than able you're more than a conqueror you're more than an overcomer you're not this an overcomer you're more you're mark he's small it's inexhaustible the supply is unlimited he's redeemed my life he's healed my body he can make the glory come upon you again the devil may have given you the church alopecia and took away your glory but moriah pruitt in her testimony shows us amen that it will take the right attitude toward a divine promise i can i will i do believe i can i will i do believe and we will press what i promise you can have it this morning take your claim i don't care if it's a baby with a broken arm and it'd be healed in the presence of god amen just one moment just one moment maybe you can be like karen emmons when i asked her when she was under surgery going under surgery for cancer and she i said what do you want me to do to this devil and she responded cut his head off they did the surgery and there was no cancer that's the truth amen i walked out anointed just like i am this morning out of the service there laid hands on jerry shaw three years he went without additional oxygen say well god took them to a greater healing yes he did but he still heals just before he would leave he saw himself running breathing healed you see it's unlimited you can't limit god the bible flows with tons of untapped resources could you

esteemed at night surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smith of god and affliction but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with the stripes we were healed oh we like sheep have gone astray we've all turned everyone to his own way and the lord laid on him [Music] why
