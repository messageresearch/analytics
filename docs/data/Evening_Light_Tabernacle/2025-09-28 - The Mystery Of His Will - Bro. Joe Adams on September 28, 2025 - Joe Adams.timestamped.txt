[6:11] There have been a few changes to include
[6:13] my lack of a microphone for a few
[6:15] moments. Just bear with the technicians.
[6:17] We're really happy that the musicians
[6:19] have a a nice spot. They're a little
[6:21] more spread out. I think some of the
[6:22] feedback that we've gotten is, "Wow,
[6:24] it's nice not to look at the back of
[6:25] somebody's head when you're trying to
[6:27] play with them." So, that's a great
[6:28] improvement. Would you agree that's a
[6:30] nice improvement?
[6:31] Amen. Our pastor's away this morning.
[6:34] He's taking the memorial service for
[6:37] brother Ed Biscll up in Cloverdale Bible
[6:39] Way and Brother Timuit's taking that
[6:41] service with him this morning. So, we
[6:44] they coveret our prayers. So, as they've
[6:46] prayed for you this morning to be here,
[6:49] uh we do want to remember them in prayer
[6:50] as well. Um we had a very nice workday
[6:54] yesterday because of who you are. It's
[6:56] in the key of G. We had a very nice
[6:59] workday yesterday. A lot was
[7:01] accomplished. So, for those of you that
[7:02] were able to come and put your shoulder
[7:06] to the wheel as it were, we certainly do
[7:07] appreciate that. There was a lot of
[7:09] pressure washing done and you know, just
[7:11] basic grounds cleanup. you know, we have
[7:13] uh special meetings coming and why we
[7:15] wouldn't want somebody to come and see a
[7:18] church that doesn't look quite cared
[7:19] for. So, it's nice to be able to do
[7:22] those things at this time. Weather was
[7:24] wonderful. And now it's the Lord's day.
[7:28] So, we just want to come into his courts
[7:29] with praise and thanksgiving on our
[7:31] hearts. See what he would do in our
[7:33] midst today. See what he would do for
[7:35] you. Maybe do for a loved one. Maybe the
[7:38] person sitting next to you. Amen. We
[7:41] just want to invite him to come this
[7:43] morning.

[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; We're nothing without him this morning.
[54:34] But with him, we're unstoppable.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; What a mighty word. What a mighty God we
[54:40] have in this hour. We just want to greet
[54:42] you this morning. Thankful for all that
[54:44] are here. Uh you know, our pastors away
[54:47] and the other ministry teams away. And
[54:50] we appreciate you being here, not
[54:52] forsaking the assembling together. I
[54:54] also want to say thank you to each and
[54:56] everyone that showed up yesterday for
[54:57] the church work day. We got a lot of
[54:59] things accomplished back in the
[55:01] fellowship hall. You go in there, you'll
[55:02] see sound panels are up. The front
[55:04] landscaping, we spent four hours, a team
[55:07] of about 10 people cleaning that up and
[55:09] freshening up the front there. Stuck
[55:11] over repairs were done in many places.
[55:14] Power washing was done in several
[55:15] places. So, a lot of things were
[55:17] accomplished and I I want to say thank
[55:20] you for those that attended that helped.
[55:22] We had a lot of the young boys came out
[55:23] and put their shoulders to the wheel and
[55:25] woo must be nice to be 24 22 again. Man,
[55:30] I'm wore out this morning. But we're
[55:32] here. We're at our post of duty and we
[55:34] just want to come and put our shoulder
[55:36] to the will and trust that we can speak
[55:38] to you. That will something that will
[55:40] bless your soul, bless your spirit.
[55:42] Maybe you've ever questioned the
[55:44] message, question your position in the
[55:46] body, why were you raised in the
[55:48] message, come to this church. Maybe by
[55:50] the grace of God today, we can kind of
[55:52] help answer some of those questions.
[55:54] Let's just go to him in prayer this
[55:55] morning. Father,
[55:57] Lord, we want to say thank you that
[55:59] you've called us into your presence,
[56:00] Lord.
[56:03] And Lord, we believe that you've
[56:04] extended to us in this hour your golden
[56:06] scepter that we as your people, Lord,
[56:09] can come. We can bring our petitions
[56:12] before you today, Father, knowing, Lord,
[56:15] that you would not withhold any good
[56:16] thing to us who walk uprightly, Lord. We
[56:19] don't walk on accordance to our merits,
[56:22] maybe the family we were born into,
[56:24] Lord, or any of the good deeds that we
[56:27] have done, Father, but it's according to
[56:29] your purpose and your will, Lord, that
[56:31] we were chosen in you before the
[56:33] foundation of the world. And Lord, since
[56:35] we were chosen in you, as I said before,
[56:38] you didn't choose us to lose us, Lord.
[56:41] So, we're so thankful we can come today.
[56:43] And we just pray God that you would
[56:44] anoint your servant to get out of the
[56:46] way that you can be able to Lord speak
[56:48] to your people. May you just anoint the
[56:50] ears of the hearer Lord. Maybe some are
[56:52] going through a battle Lord and and the
[56:55] word just seems to just be there but
[56:57] it's not really having an impact. I pray
[56:59] to this morning, Father, that the word
[57:02] find a bedding ground. It'll it'll find
[57:04] an impact, Lord, and it'll begin to
[57:06] manifest and grow today. So we just we
[57:08] commit the service to you, Father. Bless
[57:10] our visitors that's in the midst today.
[57:12] May you just reward their faith in each
[57:15] of us likewise in Jesus name. Amen. If
[57:17] you have your Bibles this morning, we're
[57:18] going to look here in the book of
[57:19] Ephesians.
[57:23] Remember the prophet taught us that the
[57:25] book of Ephesians parallels the book of
[57:27] Joshua, which is the placing of the
[57:30] elect in the land of promise. So this
[57:33] morning, we're just going to look here
[57:34] and I've been kind of on a theme coming
[57:37] out of Ephesians for the last several
[57:39] services and several more to go. If and
[57:41] when I have an opportunity to speak to
[57:43] you again, we'll look at some more
[57:44] things, different angles. Seems like the
[57:46] more you study, you kind of branch off
[57:48] here and branch off there. And the Lord
[57:50] kind of continues to re reveal himself
[57:52] to us. We find here in Ephesians 1 and
[57:54] verse three it says blessed be the God
[57:56] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[57:59] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[58:00] blessings in heavenly places in Christ.
[58:03] Notice verse four according as he has
[58:06] chosen us in him before the foundation
[58:08] of the world. And when you read this I
[58:10] want you to clue in on several of these
[58:11] major points that he has chosen us in
[58:14] him before the foundation of the world.
[58:16] That we should be holy without blame
[58:18] before him in love. Verse five, having
[58:21] predestinated us unto the adoption
[58:23] placing of children by Jesus Christ to
[58:26] himself according to the good pleasure
[58:28] of his will to the praise of his glory
[58:30] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[58:33] accepted in the beloved. key in on that.
[58:35] He had done this for us, in whom we have
[58:38] redemption through his blood, the
[58:39] forgiveness of sins, according to the
[58:41] riches of his grace, wherein he has
[58:43] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[58:45] prudence, having made known unto us the
[58:48] mystery of his will, according to his
[58:50] good pleasure, which he purposed in
[58:51] himself, that in the dispensation of the
[58:54] fullness of times, he might gather
[58:55] together in one all things in Christ,
[58:58] both which are in heaven, and which are
[59:00] on earth, even in him, in whom also we
[59:03] have attained ained of inheritance,
[59:05] being predestinated according to the
[59:07] purpose of him who workketh all things
[59:09] after the counsel of his will that we
[59:12] should be to the praise of his glory who
[59:14] first trusted in Christ and whom you
[59:16] also trusted after that you heard the
[59:18] word of truth the gospel of your
[59:19] salvation and whom also after that you
[59:22] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[59:24] Spirit of promise which is the earnest
[59:26] of our inheritance unto the redemption
[59:28] of the purchased possession unto the
[59:30] praise of his glory. God bless you. You
[59:32] can have your seats this morning.
[59:37] Just for the record, that clock back
[59:39] there is wrong. So, I have several hours
[59:41] to preach. It's not even nine o'clock.
[59:44] So, don't blame me if we go a little
[59:45] lengthy this morning. But somebody's
[59:49] Yeah, they're not doing their job or we
[59:51] didn't catch it. So, but anyway, I want
[59:53] to speak to you this morning briefly.
[59:56] Briefly, huh? When a preacher says that,
[59:58] he's lying, right? But I want to speak
[1:00:00] to you on the mystery of his will.
[1:00:04] the mystery of his will. And we take
[1:00:06] this from verse nine or let's go back to
[1:00:09] verse eight. Wherein he he is in God had
[1:00:12] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:00:15] prudence. Then he goes into verse nine.
[1:00:17] How did he abound toward us in all
[1:00:19] wisdom and prudence? By having made
[1:00:21] known unto us the wisdom of his will.
[1:00:26] Now this or the mystery of his will. And
[1:00:28] this word mystery, the English word
[1:00:30] mystery is something that is dark,
[1:00:32] obscure, secret, puzzling. It's
[1:00:35] inexplicable, incomprehensible. But it
[1:00:38] comes from the Greek word mysterion,
[1:00:40] which it has a completely different
[1:00:42] meaning. The word mysterion in the
[1:00:45] Greek, it actually means a truth here to
[1:00:47] here to hidden from human knowledge of
[1:00:49] understanding, but now being disclosed
[1:00:52] by revelation of God. So it's a
[1:00:55] religious truth that one can know only
[1:00:57] by revelation can it only be fully
[1:01:00] known. So you got mystery that we would
[1:01:03] think of a mystery dark obscure but a
[1:01:06] mystery when we look at it through the
[1:01:08] biblical eyes we find that it is it
[1:01:10] means a truth that was previously hidden
[1:01:13] but now being revealed by God.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; So it's a divine purpose that was not
[1:01:18] fully understood in past but has been
[1:01:21] made known through the gospel. And we're
[1:01:23] going to kind of take this. We look at
[1:01:25] Paul. Paul is the he would be the church
[1:01:27] founder, the first church age messenger.
[1:01:30] And he would begin to preach to the
[1:01:32] Gentiles. And he'd begin to reveal the
[1:01:34] mystery of God to the Gentile people.
[1:01:37] Remember prior to Paul, it was the
[1:01:39] Pharisees, the Sadducees, Jews, Jews,
[1:01:42] Jews. But when Paul came on the scene,
[1:01:44] his ministry was not directed to the
[1:01:46] Jews. His ministry was to the Gentiles.
[1:01:49] So we find here in Ephesians 3, Paul
[1:01:52] would even say, "For this cause," 3:1,
[1:01:55] Paul would say, "For this cause I, Paul,
[1:01:57] the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you
[1:02:00] Gentiles, if you have heard of the
[1:02:02] dispensation of the grace of God, which
[1:02:04] is given to me toward you, how that by
[1:02:07] revelation, notice how it's coming. It's
[1:02:10] coming by revelation, he made known unto
[1:02:13] me the mystery." Remember the thing that
[1:02:14] was hidden, but now been made known. The
[1:02:17] mystery, as I wrote a fore in few words,
[1:02:19] whereby when you read, you may
[1:02:21] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[1:02:23] of Christ,
[1:02:25] which in other ages was not made known
[1:02:28] unto the sons of men, as it is now
[1:02:30] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[1:02:32] prophets by the spirit, that the
[1:02:34] Gentiles should be fellow hairs of and
[1:02:38] of the same body and partakers of his
[1:02:40] promise in Christ by the gospel. So God
[1:02:43] uses Paul to declare to declare
[1:02:45] specifically how Jews and Gentiles now
[1:02:48] will be joined together in Christ. So,
[1:02:51] no longer are the Jews separate, I mean
[1:02:54] the Gentiles separate from the Jews, but
[1:02:56] now through Paul's ministry and through
[1:02:59] Paul's revelation and through the
[1:03:01] mystery that God would give Paul the
[1:03:03] revelation, he begins to include the
[1:03:05] Gentiles, you and I, Gentiles
[1:03:09] into the part of the economy of God. And
[1:03:12] we find so we find this was hint hinted
[1:03:15] at down through the ages. But yet God
[1:03:18] could not find a man to put his hand on
[1:03:20] to bring forth this revelation. But Paul
[1:03:22] on the back side of the desert in
[1:03:24] Arabia, he began to find God. He began
[1:03:27] to receive from God. No man taught Paul
[1:03:30] these great things. Remember he sat
[1:03:32] under the great teacher Galia. But Paul
[1:03:35] would even say everything that I learned
[1:03:37] I had to count it as dung so that I
[1:03:40] would know Jesus Christ and him
[1:03:41] crucified. So this understanding that
[1:03:44] Paul received it didn't come by school
[1:03:46] of the prophets. It didn't come by
[1:03:48] seminary degrees. It didn't come by
[1:03:50] man's intellect and man's wisdom. Paul's
[1:03:52] revelation came from God. And he be now
[1:03:57] clue in. He be to reveal to the Gentiles
[1:04:02] the mystery of God.
[1:04:04] Paul began to bring the revelation of
[1:04:07] the mystery of God to the gentile
[1:04:09] people.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Now, Paul's group, I believe they were
[1:04:15] well taught.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe Paul's group could say
[1:04:18] that we could say that Paul's group was
[1:04:20] probably expecting the return of Christ.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Just any day now. They were waiting.
[1:04:25] They were expecting. Paul had great
[1:04:26] understanding. Paul had great
[1:04:28] revelation. But can I say this? Paul
[1:04:31] didn't have all the revelation. And I
[1:04:34] say that very sub subjectively because
[1:04:37] we're going to find through the
[1:04:38] scripture today and why God sent us a
[1:04:40] message.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; All right. So we look here. All the
[1:04:44] mysteries wasn't revealed to Paul.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; See, he wasn't aware that there were
[1:04:49] going to be seven gentile church ages.
[1:04:52] He wasn't aware that there was going to
[1:04:54] be seven messengers to each church age
[1:04:56] and that there would be a further or
[1:04:59] greater unfolding of the mystery of
[1:05:01] God's will down through every church
[1:05:03] age.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; See in each age there was going to be a
[1:05:06] greater or additional outpouring of this
[1:05:08] revelation. But we find in Ephesians 1
[1:05:11] and verse 9 but he began Paul would get
[1:05:14] say having made known unto us. So
[1:05:18] church, we have to make it personal this
[1:05:20] morning that we can look and we can see
[1:05:23] somebody has a great revelation here or
[1:05:25] a great revelation there, but what about
[1:05:27] your understanding of the word of God?
[1:05:29] What about your revelation? And Paul
[1:05:30] begins to make it personal. Notice it
[1:05:33] come through a one-man ministry.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; The revelation came through a prophet,
[1:05:37] came through Paul, the first church age
[1:05:40] messenger. But he says, but it was came
[1:05:42] for us. The mystery, not only was it to
[1:05:45] just be placed in a prophet, but the
[1:05:47] mystery that God was making known was to
[1:05:50] be made known to the gentile race.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; And he sold us, having made known unto
[1:05:56] us the mystery of his will. And that
[1:05:59] word again, I'm going to say it over and
[1:06:01] over and over today because I want you
[1:06:03] to understand and we've been well taught
[1:06:05] by brother Tim that sometimes repetition
[1:06:07] helps you learn.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; So the key word in this entire sermon
[1:06:13] today is mystery. Something that was
[1:06:16] hidden but now being revealed.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; So we find this word Paul's saying
[1:06:21] mystery, a hidden thing, a secret, a
[1:06:24] hidden purpose or counsel, secret will,
[1:06:27] religious secrets confiding only to the
[1:06:30] initiated and not to ordinary mortals.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; So this is not just to ordinary mortals.
[1:06:37] So look at your neighbor. You're not
[1:06:39] ordinary.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Say amen, brother L.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; She's not ordinary. Nor are you.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; No. God separated us from ordinary
[1:06:53] mortals. And we're going to look at
[1:06:54] this. I have quotes and I have
[1:06:56] scriptures to prove that point. But
[1:06:59] having made known to us the secret of
[1:07:01] his will. And that word will there many
[1:07:04] times we gloss over these things and we
[1:07:06] read and we just we read to try to read
[1:07:08] quickly and oh I got a chapter in but if
[1:07:10] you stop and just dissect some of these
[1:07:12] words and look at the Greek meaning
[1:07:14] behind them but this word will there
[1:07:16] means choice or purpose or desire or
[1:07:21] pleasure what one wishes or has
[1:07:23] determined shall be done. So God here
[1:07:26] through Paul begins to reveal the secret
[1:07:29] thing that God had purposed before the
[1:07:32] foundation of the world.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; God begins to unfold it to him. Now we
[1:07:38] go to first Timothy 3 and verse 16.
[1:07:44] Kind of take my time today and kind of
[1:07:46] work through this. And it may not be
[1:07:47] super evangelistic, but you know that's
[1:07:49] neither here nor there. I want this to
[1:07:52] anchor in our hearts.
[1:07:55] 1 Timothy 3:16, Paul again, now he's
[1:07:58] writing to Timothy. He says, "Without
[1:08:00] controversy,
[1:08:01] great is the mystery." That key word
[1:08:04] again, something that's hidden but now
[1:08:06] revealed, "The mystery of godliness."
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Then he begins to explain what that
[1:08:13] mystery is. God was manifested in flesh,
[1:08:16] justified in the spirit, seen of angels,
[1:08:19] preached unto the Gentiles, believed on
[1:08:21] in the world, and received up into
[1:08:23] glory. So God, the mystery of godliness,
[1:08:28] God was manifested in the flesh. So we
[1:08:30] have to understand, if I can say it like
[1:08:33] this this morning, we have to understand
[1:08:35] the mystery of godliness so that we can
[1:08:37] understand the mystery of his will. So
[1:08:40] we have to understand the
[1:08:41] characteristics of of God, the nature of
[1:08:43] God to understand who God is. And we
[1:08:45] find here by the scripture that it says
[1:08:48] that God was manifested in the flesh.
[1:08:51] Notice the first mystery. How can God be
[1:08:55] 100% eternal spirit and yet be 100% man
[1:08:59] humanity?
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; But see, we we don't know what it means
[1:09:04] to be eternal spirit. We don't know what
[1:09:05] it means to be flawless. We don't know
[1:09:07] what it means to live perfect. We don't
[1:09:09] know what it means to be without
[1:09:10] weaknesses. And yet here God, here he
[1:09:13] is. No flaws, no weaknesses, no
[1:09:15] shortcomings, great eternal spirit knows
[1:09:18] all. And yet he comes into fallen
[1:09:20] humanity. That's a mystery
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; that God became flesh. Great eternal
[1:09:28] spirit now becomes one of us. Like one
[1:09:30] of us to have pains like us. To wake up
[1:09:33] with a headache like us. To have hard
[1:09:35] times like us. great eternal God coming
[1:09:38] to become a man so that he can be a
[1:09:40] great sucker for you and I in this hour
[1:09:43] so he can be a perpetuation for us. He
[1:09:46] knows what it means and how it feels to
[1:09:48] go through human battles. And God can
[1:09:51] only do that by becoming man. And it's a
[1:09:53] great mystery.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; How can God do that?
[1:10:00] Here he was God the eternal word made
[1:10:02] flesh was manifested in flesh. In the
[1:10:05] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:10:07] God. The word was with God. Then you
[1:10:09] drop down to verse 14. And the word was
[1:10:11] made flesh
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Then we find that it says he was
[1:10:17] justified in the spirit. Notice he was
[1:10:19] justified in spirit, but he was
[1:10:21] reproached as a sinner. He was put to
[1:10:23] death as a malifactor. He was made sin
[1:10:26] for us and was delivered for our
[1:10:28] offenses. But yet he was justified of
[1:10:30] the spirit. He didn't stay in a grave.
[1:10:32] He rose again. Why? because the spirit
[1:10:35] lifted him up.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Never before has this been done.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; But Paul begins to unfold this
[1:10:44] revelation to us. He was seen of angels,
[1:10:47] preached unto the Gentiles. Another part
[1:10:49] of the mystery that the Gentiles would
[1:10:52] receive the message of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:56] that which was purposed by Moses, that
[1:10:59] which is purposed down through the Old
[1:11:00] Testament prophets for a people for
[1:11:03] God's name's sake. And yet we find that
[1:11:06] the Gentiles, the heathens were included
[1:11:10] in the plan and purpose of God.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; He was believed on into the world. He
[1:11:14] was preached and he he was received up
[1:11:16] into the glory of the ascension. Now
[1:11:18] listen what brother Bram says here in
[1:11:19] the scriptural sign of the time. He
[1:11:21] says, "Without controversy, great is the
[1:11:24] mystery of godliness. For God was
[1:11:26] manifested in the flesh, seen of angels,
[1:11:29] handled here in the world, received up
[1:11:31] into glory." So we find this now that he
[1:11:34] was God made flesh. He tabernacled with
[1:11:37] us.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. He changed his great
[1:11:43] position from being great eternal one as
[1:11:45] we spoke last night. He was the
[1:11:47] attribute of his own thought. He became
[1:11:50] down here and become man to redeem man.
[1:11:53] I say thank you God this morning.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; So great eternal God humbled himself. He
[1:12:00] left all the glory. He became man in
[1:12:02] order to redeem fallen humanity. And
[1:12:05] that word redeem there means to be
[1:12:07] brought back. Listen how your prophet
[1:12:09] when you go and you look the word up
[1:12:10] redeem and how he would place it many
[1:12:12] times he would change the order of it or
[1:12:15] change the name the nature of it but it
[1:12:17] still means the same thing to be brought
[1:12:19] back to bring back to where you started
[1:12:21] from to bring back where you once were
[1:12:24] or to bring back to its original place
[1:12:26] or place of origin. So that tells me
[1:12:29] that this earth is not our original
[1:12:32] place. Louisiana as great as it is.
[1:12:37] Roll of the eyes for y'all on stream. As
[1:12:40] great as it is, it's magnificent
[1:12:42] magnificant however of a state that we
[1:12:45] live in. That's not our place of origin.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; But we find God through a vindicated
[1:12:53] messenger. God through a vindicated
[1:12:55] prophet will begin to reveal to you and
[1:12:58] I our place of origin. And we find here
[1:13:01] that God became man in order to redeem
[1:13:03] us, to restore us back to that place. So
[1:13:08] don't get caught up in this flesh. Don't
[1:13:10] get caught up in what's going on around
[1:13:11] you. Don't get caught up in politics.
[1:13:14] Don't get caught up in the bad days and
[1:13:16] the good days. No. Get caught up in the
[1:13:18] word.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Get caught up under revelation. Say,
[1:13:21] "God, show me where I come from. Show me
[1:13:23] where I'm going. Lord,
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; make known to me the mystery of your
[1:13:30] will, your purpose for me, for my life,
[1:13:32] for my family.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; That's what we should be asking. Notice
[1:13:36] here, then we go to 2 Corinthians 5 and
[1:13:39] verse 19. We're going to build this
[1:13:40] scripture on top of scripture.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; But brother B, as you turn there,
[1:13:43] Brother Bam says, "Redeeming to buy back
[1:13:45] is it restores to the original owner."
[1:13:48] Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; See, God by his death, shed blood,
[1:13:54] brought back his own. He brought back
[1:13:56] the spoken word seed bride.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; God did it. He did it by himself. Then
[1:14:06] we find 2 Corinthians 5 verse 19 to it
[1:14:09] that God eternal spirit was in Christ
[1:14:12] human vessel
[1:14:14] reconciling the world to himself. not
[1:14:18] imputing their trespasses upon them, and
[1:14:21] had committed unto us the word of
[1:14:23] reconciliation. That word
[1:14:25] reconciliation, now I'm an accountant.
[1:14:27] Levi's accountant. We got a couple more
[1:14:28] accountants here, but it means something
[1:14:30] completely different than our accounting
[1:14:32] terminology. This word reconciliation
[1:14:35] here means to bring back into favor.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:41] where once you were out of favor because
[1:14:43] you came in sin, you were shaped in
[1:14:45] iniquity, you needed a heavenly father,
[1:14:48] you needed a redeemer, you needed a
[1:14:50] kinsman, and God stepped down out of
[1:14:52] glory to do what? To reconcile, to bring
[1:14:55] you fallen humanity, sin cursed humanity
[1:14:58] back in favor with God again.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; It means to return to favor with to to
[1:15:04] receive one into favor.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Say, "Thanks be to God." God was in
[1:15:10] Christ reconciling the world to himself.
[1:15:12] So all that God was,
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; he poured into Jesus.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; And all that Jesus was, he poured into
[1:15:19] the church. So how did God return us to
[1:15:22] favor?
[1:15:24] He poured his life into us.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; So you're not here this morning. How
[1:15:30] many of you are here by show of hands?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Some of you are not here. You're just
[1:15:34] your body's present. I got you.
[1:15:38] But you're here. You're not just here by
[1:15:40] mistake.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; You're not just sitting and eating like
[1:15:44] tabernacle. You don't just come to this
[1:15:46] church. You're not just born into that
[1:15:47] family. The message is just just didn't
[1:15:49] come by your way
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; haphazardly.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; No. But God purposely done these things.
[1:15:58] Why? To return you into back to favor
[1:16:01] with God again. That means your place of
[1:16:04] origin was somewhere.
[1:16:06] And the great revelation is being made
[1:16:08] known in this day through a seventh
[1:16:10] angel is to let us know where is that
[1:16:13] place? Where did we come from? Where are
[1:16:16] we going?
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; He would say in the super sign. He says
[1:16:22] now the super sign was first man was the
[1:16:26] first man that God could come into. All
[1:16:28] that God was he poured into Christ and
[1:16:30] all that Christ was he poured into the
[1:16:31] church. the super sign, God and man
[1:16:33] together. That was to be the super sign
[1:16:36] of the last day when the entire Bible
[1:16:38] was to be fulfilled in the last days.
[1:16:41] We keep going here. But we find today we
[1:16:44] got Superman. Now, Superman was my
[1:16:47] favorite cartoon character. I told y'all
[1:16:49] before me and my brother, we'd put a
[1:16:51] we'd put a towel around and he would be,
[1:16:53] you know, one of the other ones. You can
[1:16:55] have you can be one of those. I'd put
[1:16:56] that towel around, climb up on the
[1:16:58] dresser. Woo! Jump off on the bed.
[1:17:00] Superman.
[1:17:03] Yeah,
[1:17:05] I was about that tall and about that
[1:17:07] wide. But something was super about me.
[1:17:10] All right,
[1:17:11] but let me dream. Right.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; But he said the world had their superman
[1:17:16] or fatic fictitious superman, all these
[1:17:19] other kind of super things, but the
[1:17:21] church has got a super sign. Listen what
[1:17:24] it is. God back in the church.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; There's your super sign church. God
[1:17:31] almighty, eternal spirit back now in the
[1:17:34] church.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this. God back in the church,
[1:17:38] manifested in human flesh. God united
[1:17:42] with man his sure super sign. See the
[1:17:46] eternal sign, an unfailing sign. It
[1:17:48] would never fail. The word and man
[1:17:50] become one. When God's word and man
[1:17:53] become one. But notice if we're not
[1:17:56] careful,
[1:17:58] we will make this statement, God united
[1:18:00] with man, here super sign about one man.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; We've seen it. We've seen the failure of
[1:18:09] humanity grasping for a super sign, for
[1:18:13] a superman. We make it all about one. We
[1:18:16] make it all about a prophet.
[1:18:19] But remember, it's God back in the
[1:18:21] church.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Manifested in human flesh.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; God united with man. Or can I say it
[1:18:31] like this? God united in mankind.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Not just one man, but mankind. God
[1:18:39] united in humanity with humanity. He
[1:18:42] says that was the super sign of the day.
[1:18:44] when that same spirit that was on Jesus
[1:18:47] Christ comes into the church to manifest
[1:18:49] the written word for the day that is
[1:18:51] still the super sign. So the super sign
[1:18:55] is still God ever remains true to the
[1:18:58] super sign. It's God in manifesting his
[1:19:01] written word. Now how many knows what
[1:19:03] the super sign is?
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Okay, I got two of y'all. Thank God if
[1:19:07] somebody's listening. It's okay to
[1:19:10] participate this morning. God's great
[1:19:13] super science is not just God and Tim
[1:19:15] Puit. Not just God and Timothy Puit or
[1:19:18] Aaron Ogensby or Donnie Reagan or Ron
[1:19:20] Spencer or any great preacher you want
[1:19:21] to put there or William Brandom or Paul
[1:19:24] or Arenus Columba, Martin Luther, all
[1:19:26] these other ones. Wesley, it's not God
[1:19:28] just in these great men. But it's God in
[1:19:31] flesh again. It's God sitting on these
[1:19:34] pews this morning. It's God hearing the
[1:19:37] word. It's revelation being unfolded to
[1:19:39] a predestinated sea. A son and daughter
[1:19:42] of God this morning, not in the days
[1:19:44] past, not in history, but God present
[1:19:46] tense this morning.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; That's the super sign that this message
[1:19:51] is true. That God is true. That he is
[1:19:54] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:19:57] For some people, all the message is is
[1:19:59] God sent a prophet.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; But can I tell you this morning, it's
[1:20:02] more than just God sending a prophet.
[1:20:05] Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Who did he send them to this morning?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a recipient of the the
[1:20:12] prophet's message. And I'm looking at it
[1:20:14] this morning.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; And he's making known to us the mystery,
[1:20:20] the hidden thing, hidden purpose of his
[1:20:24] will.
[1:20:26] Well, I was just born into the Adam's
[1:20:28] family.
[1:20:30] No.
[1:20:35] It's more than just
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; I can't even snap this morning. It's
[1:20:43] more than just belonging to evening like
[1:20:45] tabernacle.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; And we understand Revelations 10:7. If
[1:20:50] you'll go there with me this morning, I
[1:20:52] want to try to tie all this together so
[1:20:55] it will erase any question
[1:20:59] regarding you and regarding this message
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; and regarding a prophet.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; The more that I study, the more that I
[1:21:08] grow, the greater the revelation comes,
[1:21:09] the greater the purpose and the meaning
[1:21:12] behind this message. We look here,
[1:21:15] Revelations 10. But in the days of the
[1:21:17] voice of the seventh angel, now we can
[1:21:19] all agree that that day is here or that
[1:21:22] that day has passed, the seventh angel's
[1:21:24] gone. But in the days of the voice of
[1:21:26] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[1:21:28] to sound the mystery, there's that word
[1:21:30] again, that hidden secret, the hidden
[1:21:32] purpose of God should be finished as he
[1:21:35] had declared to his servants, the
[1:21:37] prophets. So we know by scripture that
[1:21:39] the seventh angel, he will reveal things
[1:21:42] that the previous messengers were not
[1:21:44] permitted to.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that okay this morning? Is it
[1:21:47] safe to say that? So Paul be began to
[1:21:51] reveal.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; All right. Corinthians, Ephesians,
[1:21:55] different areas. Second Timothy,
[1:21:57] different scriptures. Paul began to
[1:21:59] reveal the mystery of God. But the
[1:22:00] seventh angel in his day, in his
[1:22:04] ministry, he's going to finish
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; the revelation. That's right. Notice
[1:22:10] it's not that brother Brandham brought a
[1:22:12] different message,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; but he's finishing the revelation
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; that Paul started.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; See, the seventh angel is preaching what
[1:22:22] the first angel preached.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Not a different message, not a new
[1:22:26] message. But the messenger will, what is
[1:22:28] what he does? He will take the loose
[1:22:30] ends.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; He's going to take the loose ends from
[1:22:34] all their previous ages.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Great men. Some were reformers. They
[1:22:39] didn't they weren't prophets. They
[1:22:40] didn't have that revelation. They had
[1:22:42] loose sins. And brother Bram makes a
[1:22:44] statement here in the breach. He says,
[1:22:45] "Now at the sounding of the seven church
[1:22:47] age, the last church age, all the loose
[1:22:50] ends that through these church ages has
[1:22:54] been progged at." And I had to look that
[1:22:56] word up. I'm thinking, man, surely he
[1:22:59] got that wrong. No, it's Pragged.
[1:23:02] Prague means to search and to forage.
[1:23:07] So men down through the ages been
[1:23:09] searching for the revelation, searching
[1:23:11] and forging for the re understanding of
[1:23:13] the mystery of God. And he says, "All
[1:23:15] that they have progged it will be wound
[1:23:19] up together."
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; So then he goes into the first seal at
[1:23:24] the end of the Pentecostal age. I'm
[1:23:26] thinking I'm assuming the the uh Isuza
[1:23:29] Street Pentecostal age, which would be
[1:23:30] the Leodysian age, we're supposed to
[1:23:32] receive. Notice according to the word as
[1:23:34] God helped me tonight to show you
[1:23:36] through here that we are to see to
[1:23:38] receive a messenger that will take all
[1:23:40] the loose ends out there and reveal the
[1:23:43] whole secret of God for the rapturing of
[1:23:45] the church.
[1:23:49] And this is why I say that Paul didn't
[1:23:50] have all the understanding
[1:23:53] because brother Bram's going to say
[1:23:54] something here in just a minute that
[1:23:55] helps me conclude that statement that
[1:23:58] and he goes in to say and said there is
[1:24:00] coming forth seven mysteries thunders
[1:24:02] that's not even written at all. That's
[1:24:04] right. And I believe that through those
[1:24:06] seven thunders will be revealed in the
[1:24:08] last days in order to get the bride
[1:24:10] together for rapturing faith. So in
[1:24:13] Paul's day, the seven thunders, the
[1:24:14] seven mysteries, the sealed book
[1:24:18] was not revealed.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Remember when Adam fell, the book went
[1:24:22] back to the hands of the original owner.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; So it was yet to be revealed. But it
[1:24:27] would take the lamb in the book of
[1:24:29] Revelations, Revelations 5, that would
[1:24:31] take the book, reveal the book, and then
[1:24:33] the book becomes a new book. Then the
[1:24:35] mystery of God, the revelation of God
[1:24:38] has been made known. So that's what I'm
[1:24:40] trying to share with you this morning.
[1:24:41] And brother Bam says, "But see there's
[1:24:43] loose ends left that can't be explained.
[1:24:45] See, the seals hasn't been broke." So
[1:24:49] wonder why all the loose sins were in
[1:24:51] the previous ages. Cuz the seals were
[1:24:53] yet to be broke. But after the seals
[1:24:55] broke, it became a new book.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; No longer were there loose sins, but God
[1:25:00] sent a vindicated voice, a vindicated
[1:25:02] prophet, and he tied those loose ends
[1:25:05] together to make known to finish the
[1:25:08] mystery of God.
[1:25:10] to make known to us to know where you're
[1:25:13] standing.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; So you can't be buffeted. You can't be
[1:25:17] knocked off of it. You know that. You
[1:25:19] know that. You know that this message is
[1:25:22] truth
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; and who you are. Not just to know that
[1:25:25] the message is true. It's one thing to
[1:25:27] know the message is true and doubt your
[1:25:29] position in it
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; or doubt your position in the economy of
[1:25:33] God. But we're going to find God is
[1:25:36] bringing it all together through the
[1:25:37] seventh angel.
[1:25:39] He says, 'Now, what a time we're living
[1:25:41] in. This great mystery of God being
[1:25:43] finished, bringing into God has showing
[1:25:46] what it is. How these little isms went
[1:25:48] off and made them this and somebody made
[1:25:50] them that, and somebody made them this,
[1:25:51] but the angel of the Lord come down and
[1:25:54] brought up all their isms and poured out
[1:25:56] the truth of it and presented it. So God
[1:25:59] through an angel visitation through a
[1:26:02] prophet, he would come and take all
[1:26:04] these loose ends, all their little isms,
[1:26:06] and he would pull the truth out of all
[1:26:07] their little isms and bring the
[1:26:09] revelation that's been hidden before the
[1:26:12] foundation of the world. For what? To
[1:26:14] get a bride ready to get a church ready
[1:26:17] for the rapture.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; We're not taking a rapture unless all
[1:26:21] the mystery of God is finished.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:26] Oh my.
[1:26:30] Well, let's look at some of these
[1:26:31] mysteries. Is that okay? This morning,
[1:26:34] that clock is yet to move. So, I got all
[1:26:35] the time in the world. I'm just waiting
[1:26:37] on it. It ain't moved a dime. But let's
[1:26:40] look at some of the mysteries. And
[1:26:41] brother B will say this is a sign of the
[1:26:43] end, sir. You can go back and listen to
[1:26:45] it. 1962. A mystery is scripture is
[1:26:48] previously hidden truth now divinely
[1:26:51] revealed. So, this seventh angel, he's
[1:26:54] going to do, he's going to finish the
[1:26:56] mystery of God. And here are some of the
[1:26:57] mysteries. Number one, the mystery of
[1:26:59] the kingdom of heaven. Two, the mystery
[1:27:01] of Israel's blindness during this age.
[1:27:03] Romans 11:25. Three, the mystery of the
[1:27:06] translation of the living saints at the
[1:27:08] end of the age. 1 Corinthians 15 and
[1:27:10] Thessalonians 4. Fourth, the mystery of
[1:27:13] the New Testament church as a one body
[1:27:15] composed of both Jews and Gentiles.
[1:27:18] Fifth, the mystery of the church as the
[1:27:19] brother of Christ. Six, the mystery of
[1:27:21] the living Christ, same yesterday,
[1:27:23] today, and forever. Then he goes to
[1:27:25] Galatians 2:20 and Hebrews 13:8. And the
[1:27:28] seventh is the mystery of God, even
[1:27:30] Christ as the incarnate fullness of the
[1:27:32] Godhead embodied in whom all divine
[1:27:35] wisdom and godliness is restored to man.
[1:27:37] Notice the ninth mystery is the mystery
[1:27:39] of iniquity. Then we have the mystery of
[1:27:41] the seven stars in Revelations 1 and
[1:27:43] verse 20. Seven stars of the seven
[1:27:46] churches and the seven messengers and so
[1:27:48] forth. the 11th, the mystery of Babylon,
[1:27:50] the prostitute.
[1:27:52] See, these are just some of the
[1:27:53] mysteries. Then we got the serpent seed.
[1:27:56] That's been a hidden mystery all through
[1:27:57] the years. And grace, notice the mystery
[1:28:00] of grace. He said, straightened out, not
[1:28:02] disgrace, but real true grace.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Then no such thing as eternal hell or
[1:28:09] burning hell. Notice the mystery of
[1:28:11] hell.
[1:28:13] You'll burn for millions of years, but
[1:28:14] anything that was eternal had no
[1:28:16] beginning or no end. and hell was
[1:28:18] created. Then we got the mystery of the
[1:28:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:28:21] sensation, but the person of Christ
[1:28:23] performing in you the same works that he
[1:28:25] did. Then in the last, the mystery of
[1:28:27] water baptism, not in father, son, holy
[1:28:30] spirit, but in the name of the Lord
[1:28:31] Jesus Christ, not in titles, but in the
[1:28:35] name.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; So this seventh angel will begin to
[1:28:38] reveal, tie all these loose ends up into
[1:28:42] one glorious message.
[1:28:46] And he would tell us in the message
[1:28:48] adoption number four he says remember it
[1:28:51] cannot talking about a mystery it cannot
[1:28:54] be taught in a seminary
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; it's a mystery it's hidden but it's
[1:28:59] divinely revealed
[1:29:02] you cannot know it by education by
[1:29:04] theology it's a mystery that's been
[1:29:06] hidden since the foundation of the world
[1:29:08] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:29:10] sons of God then he goes on into the the
[1:29:13] the the church age And he's talking
[1:29:15] about the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:17] And he says, "You'll recall that I
[1:29:18] mentioned at the beginning of the
[1:29:19] message that this book
[1:29:22] that we are studying is the actual
[1:29:24] revelation of Jesus himself to the
[1:29:27] church and his works in future ages."
[1:29:29] Now, he's speaking on the church ages.
[1:29:31] Then I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[1:29:34] Spirit to give us revelation or we
[1:29:36] failed to get it.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; So, you can't just read and read and
[1:29:40] read and read. I don't care if you got a
[1:29:41] 160 IQ.
[1:29:44] That's not going to give you revelation.
[1:29:46] That's going to give you intellectual
[1:29:47] understanding.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; But he says, now I mentioned to you, it
[1:29:51] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:29:52] revelation or we fail to get it.
[1:29:54] Bringing these two thoughts together,
[1:29:56] you'll see that it won't take just an
[1:29:58] ordinary study and thinking to make the
[1:30:00] book real. It's going to take, notice
[1:30:02] the operation of the Holy Ghost. That
[1:30:04] means that this book can't be revealed
[1:30:06] to anyone but a special class of people.
[1:30:12] Oh my. Don't let that gloss over your
[1:30:14] head, church.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; A special class of people. Well, I
[1:30:19] thought I was just this. I thought I was
[1:30:21] this that. No, you're a special class of
[1:30:24] people.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Predestinated from the foundation of the
[1:30:28] world to receive this great revelation
[1:30:31] and unfolding of the mystery. You're not
[1:30:34] here by mistake. You're not here by
[1:30:36] happen. God predestinated you to be here
[1:30:39] this morning in this service to hear the
[1:30:42] word being preached to receive the
[1:30:44] message of the hour. That's why you're
[1:30:47] here so he can unfold to you little
[1:30:49] bride the mystery of his will his
[1:30:53] purpose
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; for coming.
[1:30:56] Let me keep going. Now this book means
[1:30:58] that it can only be revealed to a
[1:31:00] special class of people.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Man, you may be poor as dirt, but you're
[1:31:05] special.
[1:31:06] You know, there that's we're going to
[1:31:08] have that. There's going to be wealthy
[1:31:10] people, unwealthy people, fat people,
[1:31:12] skinny people, ugly people, pretty
[1:31:14] people, short people, tall people.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't matter.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; You're a special class of people.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; You're not just anybody.
[1:31:29] It will take, notice, and he goes on, it
[1:31:31] will take one with a prophetic insight.
[1:31:35] Oh, here's where we're bringing a
[1:31:37] prophet in. It's going to take one with
[1:31:39] a prophetic insight. It require the
[1:31:41] ability to hear from God. It will
[1:31:44] require supernatural instruction. Not
[1:31:47] just a student comparing verse with
[1:31:48] verse, though that's good. But a mystery
[1:31:51] requires a teaching of the spirit or it
[1:31:54] never becomes clear.
[1:31:58] how we need to hear from God and lay
[1:32:00] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:32:03] spirit to hear and to know. So the
[1:32:05] revelation of the mystery of God and his
[1:32:07] will can only come notice it will only
[1:32:10] come to a special class of people.
[1:32:14] Do you look around men Louisiana 14 13
[1:32:18] 14,000 people you got Spring Hill down
[1:32:22] the road here and we got other places
[1:32:23] down the road but you look here we have
[1:32:25] maybe 200 250 among 13,000 people 14
[1:32:29] maybe our secondary and primary service
[1:32:31] areas if we call that that's a hospital
[1:32:33] term maybe 20 25,000 people but there's
[1:32:36] 200 sitting here
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; special class of people
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; recognize who you are church You're
[1:32:43] special in the eyes of God.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; There may be days you don't feel
[1:32:47] special, but nevertheless, you're
[1:32:50] special in the eyes of God. So that's
[1:32:52] why God had to send a prophet, a
[1:32:53] vindicated prophet. He had to reveal the
[1:32:56] mystery of God, the things that were
[1:32:57] hidden, the mystery of his will, his
[1:32:59] purpose, or it would never become clear.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; See, man can't bring clarity to the
[1:33:06] mystery of God's will.
[1:33:10] How many of you know how many
[1:33:11] denominations there are in the world
[1:33:12] today? There's 47,000 different denom
[1:33:15] Christian denominations in the world
[1:33:16] today. All claiming to bring clarity to
[1:33:19] the mystery of God's will.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; See, man can't do it. Denominations
[1:33:26] can't do it. It's going to take one with
[1:33:27] a prophetic insight to come and to
[1:33:29] reveal the mystery to that special class
[1:33:32] of people that predestinated that were
[1:33:35] ordained to receive it. Amen.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; So it shows you who you are
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; regardless of your family, regardless of
[1:33:42] your mistakes, regardless of your past.
[1:33:45] That has no bearing on your future.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; We look here in 1 Corinthians 2 and
[1:33:51] verse six. Oh, let's go actually go to
[1:33:53] verse 7.
[1:33:56] But we speak the wisdom of God in a
[1:33:59] mystery,
[1:34:01] even the hidden wisdom which God
[1:34:03] ordained before the world unto our
[1:34:05] glory, which none of the princes of the
[1:34:07] world knew. For they had known, they
[1:34:09] would have not have crucified our Lord
[1:34:10] of glory. But as it is written, I have
[1:34:12] not seen, nor is he or heard, neither
[1:34:14] has it entered into the heart of man,
[1:34:15] the things which God hath prepared for
[1:34:17] them that love him. But God hath
[1:34:20] revealed them unto us by his spirit.
[1:34:23] Thank God
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; he has revealed them unto us. Not Joe
[1:34:28] Adams, not Tim Puit, not the great
[1:34:30] teachers in the message. They didn't
[1:34:31] reveal this to you, but God has revealed
[1:34:33] it to us. For the spirit searches all
[1:34:36] things, yet the deep things of God. For
[1:34:38] what man knoweth the things of man, say
[1:34:40] the spirit of man which is in him, even
[1:34:42] so the things of God knoweth no man, but
[1:34:43] the spirit of God. For now we notice it
[1:34:47] says now now we have received not the
[1:34:49] spirit of the world but the spirit which
[1:34:50] is of God that we might know the things
[1:34:53] that are freely given to us of God. So
[1:34:55] not only does revelation come by one
[1:34:57] word of prophetic insight but it's going
[1:34:59] to come by the Holy Spirit bringing
[1:35:01] forth revelation to those predestinated
[1:35:04] to open your eyes so that you can see
[1:35:06] the mystery of God. The Holy Ghost gives
[1:35:09] revelation or we failed to receive it.
[1:35:12] Colossians 1 verse 26.
[1:35:18] Even the mystery, here's that word
[1:35:20] again. Even the mystery which has been
[1:35:23] hid from the ages and from generations.
[1:35:25] But now
[1:35:28] we think about it. Oh well, this is back
[1:35:30] when Paul was preaching. It's it's many
[1:35:32] many many many years ago. Don't put it
[1:35:34] many many many years ago.
[1:35:37] Remember that's the beginning of the
[1:35:38] revelation. We're at the finalization of
[1:35:41] the revelation, the the the the
[1:35:44] crescendo of it all right here. But he
[1:35:46] says, even the mystery which had been
[1:35:48] hidden from ages and from generations,
[1:35:50] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:35:53] to whom God will make known what is the
[1:35:56] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:35:59] among the Gentiles. Notice the the words
[1:36:01] that he uses here. the riches of his
[1:36:04] glory of this mystery, this hidden
[1:36:06] secret that was once in but now being
[1:36:09] made manifest among the Gentiles which
[1:36:11] is Christ in you.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Not Christ in your neighbor,
[1:36:16] not Christ in the preacher, not Christ
[1:36:18] in the deacon, not Christ in the song
[1:36:20] leaders and all that, but it's Christ in
[1:36:22] you this morning. That's the hope of
[1:36:24] glory. That's the riches of this mystery
[1:36:27] that is no longer on great men, though
[1:36:30] we are so thankful for great preachers
[1:36:32] that can get theirselves out of the way.
[1:36:34] But it's for even you this morning, God
[1:36:36] making known the mystery of his will.
[1:36:39] That is no longer me a sinner, no longer
[1:36:41] me born in sin, shaped in iniquity, but
[1:36:43] me being a tabernacle of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:46] this morning that he came down and he
[1:36:48] accepted me and reconciled me back to
[1:36:51] his will.
[1:36:52] God bringing me back in favor with the
[1:36:54] word.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Paul begins to teach the Gentiles that
[1:37:03] the mystery of God that they were
[1:37:05] included
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; in the mystery of God.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Man, they were sinners. They were
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; outcast.
[1:37:14] But I want you to know Paul never uses
[1:37:16] the term gentile bride.
[1:37:20] All right?
[1:37:21] He uses the term church and he's
[1:37:24] speaking to the Gentiles and he's
[1:37:26] talking about church, Jew and Gentile
[1:37:29] being reconciled to God. See, that was
[1:37:32] Paul's revelation. Great revelation like
[1:37:34] we're included.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; But that's not all of it.
[1:37:40] Now,
[1:37:42] where once used to be Jew, Jew, Jew, now
[1:37:44] the mystery that we have in this hour,
[1:37:48] it's Christ in us. The anointing in us,
[1:37:52] not Christ in the four walls of this
[1:37:54] building, not Christ in the school of
[1:37:55] prophets, preachers, deacons, not Christ
[1:37:57] in your denomination, but Christ in you.
[1:38:02] No matter your background, no matter
[1:38:04] your location, no matter the state that
[1:38:07] you had to come from,
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Christ in you the hope of glory. And
[1:38:12] brother Brown makes a statement out in
[1:38:14] Christ mystery. He says, "When this
[1:38:15] revelation, this great revelation,
[1:38:18] revealed mystery is made known to you,
[1:38:20] then you denounce all the things of the
[1:38:23] world."
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; See, when you see God in this message,
[1:38:27] you can't see anything else.
[1:38:31] When the truth of this message has been
[1:38:33] revealed to you, when I say the message,
[1:38:35] now remember the message is Christ.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to associate and think
[1:38:39] when I say message only William Brandom.
[1:38:41] He was the voice that brought the
[1:38:42] message but the message is Christ.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; So when you see Christ, you see the
[1:38:46] truth of this message and it's been
[1:38:48] revealed to you not by man but by the
[1:38:50] Holy Spirit. You can't go back to
[1:38:52] systems of man. You can't go back to sin
[1:38:54] and the beggarly elements that you come
[1:38:56] out of. You can't go back to the bottle,
[1:38:58] back to the drugs. You can't go back to
[1:39:00] all these other things. You can't go
[1:39:02] back to the things that you used to find
[1:39:04] comfort in because now he is your
[1:39:06] comfort.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; He is your peace.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Once you receive this revelation of not
[1:39:12] only who God is, but who you are.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; You can't wait for the church doors to
[1:39:18] open.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; I know that's stinging some people right
[1:39:22] now. I'm sorry. Your prophet said it,
[1:39:24] not me.
[1:39:26] You can't wait for the doors to open to
[1:39:29] be in his presence
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; to hear the unfolding of the revelation
[1:39:32] of God.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; See, he's everything that you desire.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; He's everything that you think about.
[1:39:39] You wake up talking to him, you go to
[1:39:41] bed talking to him.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; He consumes you in your thinking. Why?
[1:39:46] Because you denounce all the things of
[1:39:48] the world.
[1:39:50] So, brother Brandon would take
[1:39:51] Colossians 1 verse 15- 29 and he would
[1:39:54] begin to preach Christ the mystery of
[1:39:56] God revealed. He only preached it once
[1:39:59] and he preached it shortly after the
[1:40:00] opening of the seven seals. And he's
[1:40:03] picking up on Paul's inspiration and
[1:40:06] preaching not only the mystery of
[1:40:07] godliness, who God was and how God was
[1:40:10] eternal spirit come down in man, but now
[1:40:12] he's looking beyond that and how notice
[1:40:15] not only just Jesus coming in tabernacle
[1:40:17] or God tabernacle Jesus, but now he's
[1:40:20] here preaching the mystery of the bride.
[1:40:23] See, Paul didn't use the terminology
[1:40:26] gentile bride. But the seventh angel
[1:40:28] begins to use that terminology over and
[1:40:30] over. God calling out of a leg, calling
[1:40:33] a bride out of a church.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Say, I no longer call you church. I call
[1:40:40] you bride.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; That's a revelation of a mystery.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thought it was all Gentiles. When
[1:40:46] those that will receive Christ come on
[1:40:48] in, it's great. You know, that's the
[1:40:49] gentile church. But here in the seventh
[1:40:51] angel, when he begins to sound his
[1:40:53] message, there's a calling out of a
[1:40:56] bride out of the church systems, out of
[1:40:58] the man-made creeds and dogmas. Why?
[1:41:00] because she's staying true to the word
[1:41:02] because revelation has become known to
[1:41:05] her and the mystery of God's will is
[1:41:07] being unfolded.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; So we look here, he begins to preach and
[1:41:12] he would say God emptied himself. All
[1:41:14] that God was, he poured it into Christ.
[1:41:17] And all that Christ was, he poured it or
[1:41:20] empty keynoted himself into the church.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; So pour is not spilling over and
[1:41:25] everything pours out. It's purposely
[1:41:27] done. So he purposely pours a drink.
[1:41:33] All
[1:41:35] of this he pours it into another vessel
[1:41:39] but the same contents just a different
[1:41:41] vessel.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; And all that God was eternal spirit
[1:41:45] great creator supernatural. He pours it
[1:41:47] into Christ. That's why blinded eyes
[1:41:50] could open.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; The lame could walk. The dead could come
[1:41:53] back.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; But oh church, it don't stop there.
[1:41:55] Because all that Christ was, he pours
[1:41:57] into a body.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; That's why in this day cancer's
[1:42:01] defeated. That's why in this day blind
[1:42:03] eyes can come open. That's why in this
[1:42:05] day supernatural can take place. Why?
[1:42:07] Because it's the same God pouring out
[1:42:09] himself of the same spirit. And we can
[1:42:12] have supernatural signs and wonders in
[1:42:14] this church. Not just somewhere else.
[1:42:17] Not just ages past, but God, he knows in
[1:42:20] this hour, church, emptied himself,
[1:42:22] poured himself out to make himself
[1:42:25] relevant
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; in this hour.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; That he is the same.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Very much the same.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a great revelation God has
[1:42:35] given us. All that God was, he said he
[1:42:37] entered into Christ. All the great
[1:42:39] eternals of God was entered into Christ.
[1:42:42] and all that Christ was, he entered into
[1:42:45] the church. Woo!
[1:42:48] Come on, church. Recognize who you are.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; My He goes, I think the Greek word is
[1:42:55] kinosis, which means emptied himself
[1:42:57] out. Not in a way that we would think
[1:42:59] something of something inside of
[1:43:01] somebody emptied out, but he poured
[1:43:03] himself out.
[1:43:06] He just poured himself out. Now I'm
[1:43:09] training Levi at the hospital and I'm
[1:43:11] pouring myself out, giving him all my
[1:43:15] understanding through 20some years of
[1:43:17] working there. Pouring it all out. And
[1:43:20] that's what he's saying. He emptied, he
[1:43:21] poured all his great revelation out.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ, he pours it into
[1:43:28] a bride.
[1:43:29] That's why revelation, church, is of the
[1:43:32] utmost importance. That's right.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz no man can bring this revelation to
[1:43:38] you. Only God can do it. So the bride,
[1:43:43] how many of you bride this morning?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; The bride must see who she is.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; And you don't see it by intellectual
[1:43:50] understanding. You don't see it by
[1:43:52] reading verse by verse, comparing verse
[1:43:54] by verse. So she must see, little bride.
[1:43:57] You must see that you're just as much
[1:44:00] part as the promise that Jesus is. Same
[1:44:04] way Sarah had to see that she was
[1:44:06] included in the promise just as much as
[1:44:09] Abraham was. So when God gave the
[1:44:11] promise to Abraham, you know how Sarah
[1:44:13] was. She fussed and stewed and stomped.
[1:44:16] I'm not going to go any further than
[1:44:18] that.
[1:44:19] I live in a house of a lot of girls.
[1:44:22] There's a lot of stew and fuss and
[1:44:23] stomping going on at certain times of
[1:44:24] the month.
[1:44:28] But we find Sarah. 20 years go by.
[1:44:31] Nothing different. Nothing different.
[1:44:32] Nothing there. All she's heard about is
[1:44:34] this child, this child, this child. But
[1:44:36] when she finally caught the revelation,
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; notice when she finally caught the
[1:44:42] revelation that it was going to come
[1:44:44] through her and not some Hagar. Then she
[1:44:47] judged God faithful. And that promised
[1:44:50] son who's been in waiting for 25 years,
[1:44:53] then he manifested himself. And I can
[1:44:55] tell you this morning, little bride,
[1:44:57] when you reveal, when God reveals to you
[1:44:59] who you are, and you judge him faithful
[1:45:02] today as much as he was yesterday, then
[1:45:05] you too will bring the promise of the
[1:45:07] spoken word in this hour. You will be
[1:45:09] the unfolding of the great mystery of
[1:45:11] God.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; You'll understand why you had to move
[1:45:14] here.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; You'll understand why you came to the
[1:45:17] message. You'll understand why you
[1:45:19] couldn't keep living that life.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Because revelation
[1:45:24] struck. He struck that predestinated
[1:45:26] seed.
[1:45:30] She judged and faithful.
[1:45:33] So, it's got Can I say this? We as the
[1:45:37] bride
[1:45:38] have to receive this revelation.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; And it has to become personal. Young
[1:45:46] person has to be more than mama,
[1:45:49] grandparent,
[1:45:50] pastor, preacher, church.
[1:45:54] It has to become personal. I'm included
[1:45:58] in the promise.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; I'm included in the promise. When God
[1:46:04] speaks of a bride, he's speaking of me.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; I know life may deal you a bad a bad
[1:46:10] hand every now and then, but just
[1:46:11] realize I'm a part of that bride.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Notice that's why the
[1:46:16] message came by my way is to pull me out
[1:46:19] of the systems of man. Pull me out of
[1:46:21] the life of sin. The message was sent to
[1:46:23] turn my heart.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Come on church, make it personal this
[1:46:27] morning.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; The message was sent to prepare me for a
[1:46:31] rapture so that I can meet my Lord and
[1:46:34] my Savior.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandon will tell us and
[1:46:38] that clock hadn't turned yet, so I don't
[1:46:39] know what time I started and we just
[1:46:41] going to keep preaching.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; All right. He says in Christ the mystery
[1:46:45] now God's great secret God's secret
[1:46:48] mystery that he had before the world
[1:46:50] began back in the back part of God's
[1:46:52] mind there was something that he was
[1:46:54] trying and going to achieve. Notice, not
[1:46:57] only was he trying, but he was going to
[1:47:00] achieve
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; and he had a motive in doing it in order
[1:47:03] to let himself be expressed
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; because first there was no moon, no
[1:47:08] star, no atom, no molecule or anything.
[1:47:09] He was God, but he exactly wasn't God at
[1:47:12] that time because God is an object of
[1:47:13] worship and there was nothing to worship
[1:47:15] him. But notice
[1:47:17] in this age, in this hour,
[1:47:20] for the first time that we've ever heard
[1:47:22] recorded, God sent a vindicated prophet.
[1:47:27] And not only did he just stay with the
[1:47:29] scriptures, which he did, but this
[1:47:31] prophet was permitted to go into the
[1:47:34] back part of God's mind,
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; permitted to go back where no man has
[1:47:40] ever gone before and bring those mystery
[1:47:44] truths to the forefront and begin to
[1:47:47] reveal to an end time elect,
[1:47:49] predestinated, chosen, gentile, bride
[1:47:52] exactly the purpose and the will of God.
[1:47:57] See, it's in this day under the seventh
[1:47:59] angel all the mysteries are going to be
[1:48:01] finished. And one of the greatest
[1:48:03] mysteries that God had in the back part
[1:48:05] of his mind was a gentile bride,
[1:48:09] a church, a bride out of a church. Now,
[1:48:13] so God's greatest desire, let me say it
[1:48:16] like this, God's greatest desire is his
[1:48:19] bride.
[1:48:22] God's predominant thought,
[1:48:25] prevailing predominant is his bride.
[1:48:30] That's his crowning achievement. He will
[1:48:32] take in complete service and preach on
[1:48:34] the masterpiece.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; The masterpiece being the bride.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; See, when Jessica and I were dating,
[1:48:43] liking each other, man, I thought, "Woo,
[1:48:47] I did good."
[1:48:49] She said, "I'd ride with you if you open
[1:48:51] that door, but you better watch out.
[1:48:54] I'll open all four doors,
[1:48:58] but when we started talking,
[1:49:00] my sister Rachel, I couldn't get my mind
[1:49:03] off of her. She was all I thought
[1:49:06] about." And that's what he's saying
[1:49:08] here. His prevailing thought
[1:49:11] is his bride.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Everything he's it's been sitting. He
[1:49:15] dwelt alone into eternity. He wasn't God
[1:49:18] yet. And yet you was in the back part of
[1:49:20] God's mind. He was waiting, waiting,
[1:49:23] anticipating
[1:49:25] for this hour, for this moment, for this
[1:49:27] day, for a gentile bride to be manifest
[1:49:29] that he can share himself with.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; That's why God sent us a message.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. Notice, but some
[1:49:38] would have us to believe, but his
[1:49:39] greatest desire was, "Oh, God sent a
[1:49:41] prophet. Oh, God sent a prophet."
[1:49:43] William Brand was a prophet of God for
[1:49:45] this hour. He's the Messiah sign. And I
[1:49:47] believe he's a prophet and I believe
[1:49:48] he's a Messiah sign for this day. But I
[1:49:50] don't believe it's all about him.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; And I got scripture and I got quotes to
[1:49:54] back it up. See, believing God sent a
[1:49:56] prophet.
[1:49:59] See, some of them teach that all you got
[1:50:00] to do is believe God sent a prophet and
[1:50:01] you're rapture ready.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; You going to be disappointed.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; You believe God sent a prophet and you
[1:50:07] got the Holy Ghost, you will be
[1:50:09] disappointed on that day
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; because it's more than just believing
[1:50:14] God sent a prophet. You have to
[1:50:16] understand why did he come? Who was he
[1:50:18] sent to? What is he telling me? What is
[1:50:21] he revealing?
[1:50:23] So, brother B said in his great mind he
[1:50:26] wanted these attributes to be expressed
[1:50:27] in him was love and him was father and
[1:50:30] him was son and it was to be a savior.
[1:50:32] Him was to be a healer. All these great
[1:50:34] attributes that we see already
[1:50:36] expressed. They were in God. And yet God
[1:50:38] wasn't even an object of worship at this
[1:50:40] time. So he created angels. But the
[1:50:42] angels could not give God exactly what
[1:50:44] he wanted. He wanted more than just to
[1:50:47] be worshiped. I'm a husband and I love
[1:50:50] my wife and she's never called me Lord.
[1:50:52] Don't worry.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; But I don't want to be worshiped in that
[1:50:58] aspect. I want to be loved
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; because I love her. I love my children.
[1:51:03] I don't want them just to go through
[1:51:04] religious duty. This is what you do. No,
[1:51:07] I want to be loved. And God wants to be
[1:51:10] loved by his bride. Not just worshiped.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; He desires. He desires worship. But
[1:51:16] beyond that, he desires to be loved.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Someone to love him and to praise him
[1:51:21] and to offer a sacrifice of praise. When
[1:51:24] everything's going wrong, everything's
[1:51:25] tossy turby in your life. You still
[1:51:27] offer a sacrifice of praise. Why?
[1:51:29] Because it comes from a heart of love.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; But brother B says God had a purpose and
[1:51:35] a hidden mystery.
[1:51:38] What is the message for then, brother
[1:51:40] Joe? Was it sense? So God can show the
[1:51:43] world that he can get one man in his
[1:51:45] hand and he can do supernatural things.
[1:51:47] He can do the first pull of the sign in
[1:51:50] the hand and the second pull and the
[1:51:51] discernment of the spirit. Was it just
[1:51:54] that or was it to prove that he can to
[1:51:56] the theologians and intellectuals of the
[1:51:58] day that he can take a seventh grade
[1:52:00] Kuckian and confound scholars?
[1:52:04] The message is much more
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; than the first and second poll.
[1:52:11] Those were gifts that God used to catch
[1:52:14] the rainbow trout.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; To get your attention
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; so that he can unfold this great
[1:52:21] revelation to you. So the message is
[1:52:23] more than just God sending a prophet.
[1:52:26] God sent a message through a vindicated
[1:52:28] prophet to make known to us his bride
[1:52:31] the mystery or the purpose of his will.
[1:52:34] Otherwise that word purpose there or
[1:52:36] that word will there is intentions.
[1:52:39] He's got intentions to take somebody for
[1:52:41] a wife.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; So it was sent to call a bride out of a
[1:52:46] church and prepare a bride for a rapture
[1:52:48] to get her
[1:52:50] dressed in the word of God.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; So this message is our dress wear.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; And brother B will say it like this. I
[1:52:57] hope we can crown that he will crown my
[1:52:59] ministry of this of letting me take the
[1:53:02] clothes of the word and dress the bride
[1:53:04] in the clothes of the word and for his
[1:53:06] righteousness.
[1:53:08] That's the message of the last days, the
[1:53:10] even light. And the first is first find
[1:53:12] the church where they will believe the
[1:53:14] message. Hunt it. Notice hunt where the
[1:53:16] church is
[1:53:18] is that'll even let you come in. They
[1:53:20] won't close the door. It's in your face.
[1:53:22] And this is in 1963 after healing
[1:53:24] revival left and he begin to be
[1:53:25] rejected. And then when you do there,
[1:53:28] you'll find character now is she'll
[1:53:29] stand still long enough to tell her how
[1:53:31] the bride's got to be dressed. She's got
[1:53:33] to be clothed. Stand still. Notice then
[1:53:36] he goes into little Rebecca listening to
[1:53:38] every word her little heart beating and
[1:53:40] he was telling her and now you sweating
[1:53:43] it out where will I go and until I find
[1:53:45] character then when he find the
[1:53:47] character then he's got to make her
[1:53:48] stand still long enough to get ready to
[1:53:50] meet him. See get her ready stand still
[1:53:52] and listen to the message of him.
[1:53:54] Eleazar wasn't speaking of himself but
[1:53:57] he was speaking of the one he was sent
[1:53:59] from. Yes.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, her affection wasn't on Eleazar, but
[1:54:04] her affection, her heart began to beat
[1:54:07] the one that Eleazar was telling her
[1:54:08] about. But many of us had made
[1:54:11] everything about this message all about
[1:54:13] Eleazar. And it has nothing to do with
[1:54:15] Eleazar. We're not going to marry
[1:54:17] Eleazar. We're going to marry Isaac.
[1:54:19] We're going to marry Christ the word,
[1:54:21] not William Bren the prophet.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; And I don't mean that disrespectfully to
[1:54:25] a prophet. We need a prophet voice. It's
[1:54:27] the one that opens the revelation to us.
[1:54:29] But don't just get focused on that.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Recognize who you are and who you're
[1:54:34] going to marry, church.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; We're marrying Christ the word.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; And it took a prophet. It took an
[1:54:42] eleaser
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; to tell us all about it.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; And when they asked, "Will you go?" She
[1:54:50] didn't stumble. She didn't stutter. She
[1:54:52] said, "Yes, I'll go.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'll go. And that's what it's
[1:54:58] about, church. This message was sent to
[1:55:01] lift this end time bri out of Satan's
[1:55:03] Eden and to restore her back to her
[1:55:06] original position.
[1:55:08] See, brother said, God's great mystery
[1:55:10] of how it's a secret is kept a secret.
[1:55:12] Nobody know nothing about it. Even the
[1:55:14] angels didn't know about it. But he
[1:55:18] showed or revealed it in every type of
[1:55:20] the Bible. Therefore, the entire Bible
[1:55:22] is a revelation of God's mystery in
[1:55:24] Christ. The entire Bible is an
[1:55:26] expression of one goal that God had one
[1:55:29] purpose that he wanted to achieve in the
[1:55:32] entire Bible.
[1:55:34] And he says and all the acts of all the
[1:55:35] other believers in the Bible has been in
[1:55:37] type and expressing what God's great
[1:55:40] goal is. And now in the last day, he has
[1:55:42] revealed it and he shows it. What are
[1:55:45] you talking about, brother Yo? Moses and
[1:55:47] Zapor,
[1:55:49] Joseph and his gentile wife. Boaz Ruth
[1:55:52] the Moabitete. Salmon marry and Rahab
[1:55:55] the harlot. Hosea taking wife of
[1:55:57] whoredoms. Abraham and Sarah being
[1:56:00] turned back to bring forth the promised
[1:56:02] word. It's been typed all down through.
[1:56:05] But today it's no longer type. Today we
[1:56:09] are the manifestation. Somebody's going
[1:56:12] to be the full revelation of the mystery
[1:56:14] of God.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; So notice he said the fullness of God of
[1:56:18] the Godhead is made known. The secret
[1:56:20] mystery is now revealed and God is
[1:56:23] manifested. God and man become one. The
[1:56:26] anointed man Christ. What does Christ
[1:56:28] mean? The anointed one. In Colossians 1
[1:56:31] verse 27, we find again we go back to
[1:56:34] this. To whom God will make known what
[1:56:36] is the riches of his glory of the
[1:56:37] mystery among the Gentiles, which is
[1:56:40] Christ in you, the hope of glory. So the
[1:56:43] entire mystery that's in the back part
[1:56:45] of God's mind
[1:56:49] is you.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; You're the mystery.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; You're the mystery in your failures, in
[1:56:59] your weaknesses, in your shortcomings,
[1:57:01] in your disappointments, on your bad
[1:57:04] days, in your sicknesses.
[1:57:07] You are the mystery.
[1:57:11] You are the mystery.
[1:57:16] See, you're the mystery. How can a holy,
[1:57:18] righteous, sinless God dwell in fallen,
[1:57:22] sinful, decay in humanity? I don't
[1:57:25] understand it. And I can't explain it.
[1:57:28] All I can tell you is he's living in me.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; My desires have been changed. My
[1:57:33] nature's been changed. The things I used
[1:57:35] to do, I don't do no more. I don't have
[1:57:37] no desire to go back to the world. I
[1:57:38] have no desires to go back to the bars.
[1:57:40] Had no desires to go back to the drugs.
[1:57:42] Have no desires to go back to the
[1:57:43] drinking. Had no desires to go back to
[1:57:45] the that kind of lifestyle. Why? Because
[1:57:47] I have been changed.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, the Baptist church
[1:57:52] didn't do it. The Pentecostal church
[1:57:53] didn't do it. The Presbyterian church
[1:57:55] didn't do it for me. I jumped all around
[1:57:56] all those denominational churches. But
[1:57:58] it took one with a prophetic insight.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. and the unfolding of the
[1:58:03] mystery of his will to show me who I was
[1:58:07] in this message.
[1:58:10] Can we keep going? Says Moses had them
[1:58:13] partly.
[1:58:15] So the great mystery, let me go back.
[1:58:16] The great mystery is God tabernacle
[1:58:20] humanity.
[1:58:21] And you look at your neighbor, you're
[1:58:22] like, "Woo, that is a mystery."
[1:58:27] Some of you just look with a big big
[1:58:29] smile on your face. Don't look at your
[1:58:31] neighbor and do that.
[1:58:34] But God, I know there's some days you
[1:58:37] wake up like, "Ain't no way God's in
[1:58:38] there this morning."
[1:58:40] But he is.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Thank God. But notice he said Moses had
[1:58:46] him partly. David had him. Oh my. But
[1:58:49] here he is manifested in the fullness
[1:58:51] deity himself standing on earth. God in
[1:58:54] the fullness to die for the sin of the
[1:58:55] people that he might bring his church a
[1:58:58] sanctified life. that he might have
[1:59:00] preeminence in the fullness in his
[1:59:02] church to manifest every promise in the
[1:59:04] last days that he promised for the last
[1:59:07] days. God came and manifested himself,
[1:59:10] the great eternal spirit that couldn't
[1:59:13] die as a spirit. So, he became man in
[1:59:15] order to redeem and restore fallen man.
[1:59:17] He became Christ in order to fulfill all
[1:59:20] those great attributes that he had. He
[1:59:22] had attributes to be a healer. There had
[1:59:24] to be somebody sick so that God could
[1:59:26] heal. And we see with sister Atlanta and
[1:59:28] different others here, there had to be
[1:59:30] somebody that would get that would get
[1:59:32] cancer. But God will show himself
[1:59:34] greater than the cancer. He come to know
[1:59:36] that he could be a deliverer. So there
[1:59:38] had to be somebody lost that needed
[1:59:40] deliverance. And he came to manifest
[1:59:42] that. Somebody to be a father or he had
[1:59:44] an attribute to be a father. There had
[1:59:46] to be sons and daughters of God in this
[1:59:48] hour that say, "Yes, that's who I am."
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; He had attributes to be a groom and it
[1:59:53] had to be a bride. That's right.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; See, God didn't manifest himself in
[1:59:57] Jesus
[1:59:59] just to prove that he could become a
[2:00:01] man.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; That's going to shock some people.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; He became Jesus because of you.
[2:00:15] That's why
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; cuz all these thoughts
[2:00:21] on the back part, healer, deliverer, but
[2:00:24] all that, the greatest thought he had
[2:00:27] was a bride and she was going to be a
[2:00:30] human bride
[2:00:33] and he was going to heal that bride and
[2:00:36] deliver that bride and marry that bride.
[2:00:40] and that preeminence in that bride.
[2:00:43] So all this he became Jesus Christ
[2:00:47] eternal spirit became a man for you.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever short change yourself.
[2:00:56] Don't you ever quit on yourself.
[2:00:59] God became Jesus Christ for you.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; For you. For you.
[2:01:08] my and he's the greatest of all
[2:01:11] revelations.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; He came to heal you, deliver you,
[2:01:16] restore you, reveal himself to you. Not
[2:01:18] only reveal himself, but reveal who you
[2:01:20] positionally are.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; So he's not telling us, brother tell us,
[2:01:25] he's not sharing these secrets with the
[2:01:27] flurers.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; only to the predestinated.
[2:01:33] So if you got ears that can hear and
[2:01:35] you've heard, come on, church.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Who are you this morning?
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is beautiful.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; So what was Jesus manifested for? I know
[2:01:46] you was asking that question. He said to
[2:01:48] show God that he was God. Then he goes
[2:01:51] in to say and through that purpose he
[2:01:54] achieved the church that he the fullness
[2:01:56] of God might bring to pass every promise
[2:01:58] of the word of God in the last days.
[2:02:00] when he gets to preeminence preeminence
[2:02:02] in the church the position he place in
[2:02:05] the church Jesus said he that believeth
[2:02:07] on me and the works that I do shall you
[2:02:08] do also even more than this shall you do
[2:02:10] for I go unto the father that was his
[2:02:13] purpose
[2:02:15] so he sanctified with his spirit and
[2:02:18] blood a church that he might make every
[2:02:21] promise in the last day revealed and
[2:02:24] then Christ the mystery he says he had a
[2:02:25] three-fold purpose of God one God wanted
[2:02:28] to reveal himself to a people. He
[2:02:30] couldn't do it as eternal spirit. So he
[2:02:32] had to take on the form of humanity and
[2:02:34] he came as his son Jesus Christ. Second
[2:02:36] he wanted to have preeminence in a body
[2:02:38] of believers that is his bride that he
[2:02:39] might live in a people. Third that he
[2:02:42] was going to restore Eden or bring back
[2:02:44] that which was lost the bride and the
[2:02:46] groom back to Eden again.
[2:02:49] Then it would say the anointed man but
[2:02:52] now the anointed people.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; So all that God was is in Christ again.
[2:02:58] And the reason why Christ came is
[2:02:59] because of you. And so all that Christ
[2:03:01] was, he empties it into us, you. So we
[2:03:04] look here in the deity of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:06] He's the creator of all things. He made
[2:03:08] He made life, frogs and bees and ducks
[2:03:11] and chickens and animals and created
[2:03:12] everything. Nothing was made that was
[2:03:14] not made by him. Who Christ the deity?
[2:03:17] He brought plagues and everything in the
[2:03:18] days of Egypt. Who Christ? He stopped
[2:03:20] the mouths of lions. He quenched the
[2:03:22] violence of fire. They escaped the edge
[2:03:24] of the sword. They raised the dead from
[2:03:25] the grave. Who Christ? Oh my. What will
[2:03:28] it be? Who is it? It's Christ the deity.
[2:03:30] And he said, "Brother and sister, that
[2:03:32] deity is in you."
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, we just think, "Ah, I just got to
[2:03:39] drag myself to church." No, you're deity
[2:03:41] this morning.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; He says, "No, Christ in you."
[2:03:47] Hallelujah. We're not worshiping Christ
[2:03:49] in a manger, but Christ in you, the Holy
[2:03:51] Ghost, the hope of life. Hallelujah. The
[2:03:53] creator, God himself, dwelling in the
[2:03:56] human being.
[2:03:58] God, Christ, the the hope of glory is in
[2:04:00] you, not in a cradle, in you.
[2:04:05] Then in the church age, he said, "Now
[2:04:06] the word most definitely sets forth that
[2:04:09] from before the foundation of the world,
[2:04:11] the earth or the foundation of the
[2:04:13] earth, the purpose of God was to share
[2:04:15] his eternal life with man." And then you
[2:04:19] go to Ephesians and we went there. It's
[2:04:20] where we started. He chose us in him
[2:04:23] before the foundation of the world. He
[2:04:24] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[2:04:26] children according to his good pleasure.
[2:04:28] He made us accepted and beloved and we
[2:04:30] have redemption through his blood and
[2:04:31] forgiveness of sins. Everything that God
[2:04:33] wanted to do, he wanted to do it with
[2:04:35] us.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Let me go on a little bit further here.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Can I go a few more minutes this
[2:04:47] morning? It's just now one o'clock.
[2:04:50] All right. That that thing up there is
[2:04:52] lying. But I'm gonna keep it honest
[2:04:54] today.
[2:04:55] He said the messenger of Malachi 4 in
[2:04:58] Revelations 10:7 is going to do two
[2:05:00] things.
[2:05:02] According to Malachi 4, he will turn the
[2:05:04] hearts of the children to the fathers.
[2:05:07] And he will reveal the mysteries of the
[2:05:09] seven thunders in Revelations 10, which
[2:05:11] are the revelations contained in the
[2:05:13] seven seals. And it will be these
[2:05:15] divinely revealed mystery
[2:05:18] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[2:05:21] the children back to the Pentecostal
[2:05:23] fathers.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; So it's the revelation
[2:05:28] unfolded that turns our heart back. So
[2:05:30] we see who we are.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; But he says he goes on into the church.
[2:05:35] He says the people in John's day mistook
[2:05:38] him for the Messiah.
[2:05:41] He says, "Now the last day prophet
[2:05:42] messenger will have such power before
[2:05:45] the Lord that there will be those who
[2:05:47] mistake him for the Lord Jesus. There
[2:05:49] will be a spirit in the world at the end
[2:05:51] time that will seduce some and make them
[2:05:54] believe this."
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; And he goes on down a little further. He
[2:05:57] says, "But don't you believe that he's
[2:05:59] not Jesus Christ? He's not the son of
[2:06:01] God. He is one of the brethren, a
[2:06:02] prophet, a messenger, a servant of God.
[2:06:05] He needs no greater honor bestowed upon
[2:06:07] him than that which John received when
[2:06:09] he was the voice that cried, I am not
[2:06:11] he, but he is coming after me.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; So I'm trying to show you this this
[2:06:18] thing that we call the message.
[2:06:21] It's not just about William Brand
[2:06:25] though he is a very intricate and
[2:06:28] intricral part of the unfolding of the
[2:06:31] mystery of God.
[2:06:33] Brother says, "You know what? He had a
[2:06:36] purpose in saving me."
[2:06:40] Come on, somebody.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Hell, he had a purpose of
[2:06:44] bringing you out of Mississippi.
[2:06:46] He had a purpose of bringing me out of
[2:06:48] Mississippi. One of probably the best
[2:06:50] things that ever come out of that state.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, y'all. Say amen to that.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; We got to get it where we can, brother.
[2:07:03] Ain't a whole lot coming out of
[2:07:04] Mississippi. Good, bro. But notice, he's
[2:07:07] had a purpose in saving. He had a
[2:07:09] purpose in saving you. And I'm
[2:07:11] determined by his will to do his will.
[2:07:13] That's the reason he done it. I don't
[2:07:15] know. He says, I don't know why he done
[2:07:16] it. He goes, you know, there was
[2:07:18] millions in sin when I got saved. But he
[2:07:20] had a purpose in saving me. He goes, I'm
[2:07:22] an oddball amongst the brethren. Many
[2:07:23] times, believe in predestination, seed
[2:07:25] of the serpent, baptism in the name of
[2:07:26] Jesus Christ, all these other things,
[2:07:28] see things and visions and powers of
[2:07:30] Christ return back condemning
[2:07:31] organization and things. I'm an oddball.
[2:07:33] But he had a reason to save me, a
[2:07:35] purpose for doing it. He saved me when
[2:07:37] there was millions of others in sin. But
[2:07:40] he saved me for some reason. And can I
[2:07:42] tell you this morning, he saved you for
[2:07:44] some reason.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; He saved you for a purpose this morning.
[2:07:48] And he brought you here for a purpose.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "There were educated men, smart
[2:07:53] men. There were theologians. There were
[2:07:55] bishops and doctors and so forth in the
[2:07:57] field when he saved me. But he saved me
[2:08:00] for some reason."
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:02] And God has got a purpose of you being
[2:08:05] here.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; See, you can only be get to the place
[2:08:09] how much he goes, if you can only be get
[2:08:11] to the place, how much trouble you would
[2:08:14] save God and yourself.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; And the whole church said, "Amen."
[2:08:19] We build bridges and cross them. My
[2:08:21] goodness.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Y'all know you a bunch of bridge
[2:08:27] builders this morning,
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; man. You build, you make things happen
[2:08:31] that ain't even close to going to
[2:08:32] happen.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; We all do it, church.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; But God, nevertheless, he saved us for a
[2:08:38] purpose. God had a purpose in saving you
[2:08:41] because why? You were in the eternal
[2:08:43] thoughts of God before the foundation of
[2:08:45] the world. You was the one that God
[2:08:47] wanted to spend eternity with. You were
[2:08:49] the one that God wanted to share his
[2:08:51] love with. You was the one God wanted to
[2:08:53] reveal his mystery to. You were the one
[2:08:55] this morning. And God had to save you in
[2:08:58] order to fulfill the plan of redemption.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; God did it. And we find here in
[2:09:03] according to Revelations 5, the Bible
[2:09:05] tells no man was worthy to take the book
[2:09:08] or even look at the book.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; But God,
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; but God came a man became the lamb. John
[2:09:18] looked for the lion of the tribe of
[2:09:20] Judah and he saw a lamb that had been
[2:09:22] slain.
[2:09:24] And that lamb took the book from out of
[2:09:27] the hand of the one that was on the
[2:09:28] throne.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. The book, the
[2:09:33] title deed of redemption, brother say
[2:09:35] it's the book of redemption. All those
[2:09:37] that would be redeemed, everything laid
[2:09:40] in that seal book. But when that lamb
[2:09:42] took the book, he handed it down to John
[2:09:45] in Revelation 7. And John is a type of
[2:09:48] the bride. And now little bride, it
[2:09:50] ain't in the hands of the angel anymore.
[2:09:52] It's not in the hand of the original
[2:09:53] owner anymore. Now the book is in our
[2:09:55] hands. Now it's in our belly. Now we
[2:09:58] must prophesy again. We must manifest
[2:10:01] the vision that pertains to the bride of
[2:10:03] Jesus Christ.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; He said it's a forfeited title deed is
[2:10:08] in the hands of the original owner,
[2:10:09] Almighty God. The title deed to the
[2:10:11] earth to eternal life. When Adam
[2:10:13] forfeited it and Satan's dirty hands
[2:10:15] couldn't take it, but it went back to
[2:10:17] the original owner, God himself. And he
[2:10:20] sits on the throne with it in his hand.
[2:10:22] The title D. That makes me feel
[2:10:24] religious. The title deed to eternal
[2:10:27] life. Abstract title D. Eternal life.
[2:10:29] When Adam forfeited it for wisdom
[2:10:31] instead of faith and went back to the
[2:10:32] hands of the original almighty God,
[2:10:34] waiting for what?
[2:10:37] Redemptive claims.
[2:10:40] God is claiming.
[2:10:43] God is claiming. This book of redemption
[2:10:46] is a title deed. What's an abstract to a
[2:10:48] title? Means it's been searched all the
[2:10:50] way back.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Like a drop of ink into bleach.
[2:10:55] You can't find a trace of it.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Some of you should say, "Amen."
[2:11:00] Hallelujah. Cuz you know what you've
[2:11:02] done. You know the life that you live.
[2:11:04] But when that confessed sin is dropped
[2:11:06] into the blood of Jesus Christ, it goes
[2:11:08] all the way back. Hallelujah. Falls on
[2:11:11] the head of the accuser. And now we're
[2:11:13] sinless. Come on, little bride. You may
[2:11:15] have walked in sin. You may have done
[2:11:17] things that you wasn't proud of. Oh, but
[2:11:19] once that confessed sin has dropped into
[2:11:21] the bleach of the blood, there ain't no
[2:11:23] more sin. There is no condemnation to
[2:11:26] them that the mystery is being made
[2:11:28] known to.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful word we have. What a
[2:11:33] beautiful message we have. What a
[2:11:35] beautiful people we are.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I feel religious
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; cuz I know where I've been. I know what
[2:11:41] I've done. But I know where I'm going
[2:11:42] this morning because God the great
[2:11:44] creator had poured himself out. It's
[2:11:48] more than just a message. It's my life.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; He's everything to me this morning.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Let me keep going.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I keep looking back
[2:12:03] there. Everything ain't changed.
[2:12:06] Mercy. I'm sorry. Either I'm dumb or
[2:12:08] dumber.
[2:12:10] Notice he said the the law required a
[2:12:15] kinsman redeemer.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; And no man was found worthy.
[2:12:22] Wasn't worthy to take the book. But it
[2:12:24] also says in Revelations 5, wasn't even
[2:12:26] worthy to look at the book. Could you
[2:12:29] just imagine this scene for a minute? No
[2:12:32] human was worthy even to place eyes on
[2:12:36] the book. Not the contents of the book.
[2:12:40] the book
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; and the law required a kinsman redeemer
[2:12:47] and brother says grace met the
[2:12:49] requirement
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; in the person of Jesus Christ
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; and the virgin birth produced
[2:12:56] our kinsman redeemer so what was the
[2:12:59] purpose
[2:13:00] what was the purpose of the birth to say
[2:13:03] that Jesus could be born that God become
[2:13:04] a man
[2:13:07] it's more than just God becoming a
[2:13:09] And it's more than this this message
[2:13:11] coming in William Bran.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; See, God condensed, became a man who was
[2:13:17] without sin, became sin that he could
[2:13:19] fulfill the thoughts that were in the
[2:13:21] back part of his mind, the hidden
[2:13:22] mystery, make himself known to have
[2:13:24] preeminence in a body so he can get her
[2:13:27] ready. Get her rapture ready by
[2:13:32] unfolding the mystery. His purpose.
[2:13:37] his purpose
[2:13:39] of calling you out.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; And if he's called you out, he's taking
[2:13:44] you in.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now God's law required a
[2:13:49] kinsman redeemer. The lamb come out
[2:13:50] hollering, I am their kinsman. I am
[2:13:53] their redeemer. I have made intercession
[2:13:55] for them. And now I've come to claim
[2:13:57] their rights for them. There's the only
[2:13:59] one. I've come to claim their rights in
[2:14:02] that they have a right to everything
[2:14:04] that Adam and Eve lost. I paid the
[2:14:07] price.
[2:14:09] So to claim it back for humans and
[2:14:11] brother man says now the seals were
[2:14:12] broke. Why? In the last church age to
[2:14:14] reveal these truths. The lamb broke the
[2:14:16] seals and revealed them to this church
[2:14:18] in order to collect his subjects for his
[2:14:20] kingdom his bride. See oh my he wants to
[2:14:23] bring his subjects to him. bow.
[2:14:28] Oh church, then we go into he says, "Now
[2:14:31] in the Christian age, there was one God
[2:14:33] which appeared in the form of the pillar
[2:14:35] of fire to a prophet called Paul who was
[2:14:37] set to sent to the Gentiles to take a
[2:14:40] people out for his name's sake."
[2:14:42] And this phrase here, his name's sake,
[2:14:45] means there's going to be a one that
[2:14:47] carries on his name.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; She takes on his name.
[2:14:53] Now, Jessica, when we got married 23
[2:14:55] years ago, she took on my name. She's
[2:14:58] not Miss Joe or Miss Joseph, she took on
[2:15:03] my name, my last name. She's Miss Adams.
[2:15:08] And that's what we find here is he's
[2:15:10] called out a people
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; that would be Miss Jesus Christ.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. Not Miss Baptist, not Miss
[2:15:20] Pentecost, not Miss whatever 47,000
[2:15:23] different denominations, not miss
[2:15:25] message,
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; but miss Jesus Christ.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; And he said he died for the purpose to
[2:15:38] resurrect his bride, the body.
[2:15:41] Oh. And he says now, and I'm bringing
[2:15:42] this down to a close,
[2:15:45] musicians, make your way back. We're
[2:15:46] about to parachute out of here.
[2:15:49] He says, "Now, come on, musicians."
[2:15:56] Mercy. I'm calling. Everybody's like,
[2:15:59] "Would y'all heard him get up there?
[2:16:03] Few more minutes, but y'all just play
[2:16:04] something softly, please."
[2:16:09] Thank you for being great, great
[2:16:11] listeners this morning, wonderful
[2:16:13] participants.
[2:16:14] But he says now this is in Christ
[2:16:16] mission. Now
[2:16:18] the life in the body is the vindication
[2:16:21] that the rapture is at hand. A few
[2:16:24] services back I preached on you
[2:16:26] predestinated unto quickening power and
[2:16:28] you hath he quickened. Quicken means to
[2:16:31] made alive and now we find life in the
[2:16:33] body is a vindication that the rapture
[2:16:36] is hand. When you see the headship and
[2:16:38] the body becoming one, the fullness of
[2:16:39] the measure of his manifestation shows
[2:16:42] that the body is about ready to receive
[2:16:44] the headship. He begin to give life unto
[2:16:47] the body. The one that he's redeemed, a
[2:16:50] meteor mediatorial work is done. He's
[2:16:52] bringing his life to the body in a
[2:16:55] vindication for the rapture. Then he
[2:16:58] goes on to say, "Oh church, Christ the
[2:17:01] true headship is coming in his bride,
[2:17:04] doing the same works that he did at the
[2:17:06] beginning, making ready the fulfilling
[2:17:07] of his word as he did at the first." In
[2:17:09] John 14:12, he said, "The head and the
[2:17:12] body are becoming one in the works and
[2:17:14] in signs and in life, vindicated by God
[2:17:16] himself through his promised word for
[2:17:18] the last days." He promised this to the
[2:17:20] last days.
[2:17:22] Oh, he says, "Notice,
[2:17:24] if you can see that the marriage supper
[2:17:26] is at hand."
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. Just a few more
[2:17:30] settings of the sun.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Just a few more. We're going to step out
[2:17:35] of this pest house of humanity.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; And we're going to step into a new body.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God be to reveal to us
[2:17:43] we're not part of the world.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; We never were part of the chicken yard.
[2:17:47] We may have pecked around and done
[2:17:48] things we shouldn't, but all the time we
[2:17:51] always was an eagle. We always were sons
[2:17:54] of God. We always was daughters of God.
[2:17:57] We always were the bride of Jesus
[2:18:00] Christ. Always were and always will be.
[2:18:04] Church,
[2:18:06] he said the head and the body are
[2:18:08] becoming one.
[2:18:12] the head, Christ, and the body of the
[2:18:15] bride.
[2:18:17] No longer twain. She's not doing her own
[2:18:20] thing.
[2:18:21] No, she's subject to the head.
[2:18:25] The head and the body are becoming one
[2:18:27] in works and signs in life, vindicated
[2:18:30] by God himself through the promised
[2:18:31] word.
[2:18:33] See, the marriage supper is at hand. If
[2:18:35] you can see again, remember the marriage
[2:18:37] supper
[2:18:39] is at hand.
[2:18:42] Then the kingdom according to the
[2:18:44] promise is ready to be issued in the
[2:18:46] great millennium taken up of the church
[2:18:47] and destroying of the wicked the world
[2:18:49] under the sixth seal to be purified by
[2:18:52] volcanic to take on the corruption the
[2:18:54] sin of the world and to mold her out
[2:18:55] again and bring forth the bright new
[2:18:57] millennium for the age that has come
[2:18:58] now. And he goes on the great three-fold
[2:19:01] manifestation of revelation God in
[2:19:03] Christ Christ in the church in the
[2:19:05] kingdom coming.
[2:19:07] He goes, "I'm talking about the headship
[2:19:09] in Christ
[2:19:11] being personally identified
[2:19:14] by the original headship." We have the
[2:19:17] answer, church.
[2:19:20] There's been a lot of questions you may
[2:19:22] not have had the answer for. There have
[2:19:24] been a lot of things you may have, you
[2:19:25] know, the devil may have stumped you on,
[2:19:27] but we have the answer, according to a
[2:19:28] prophet, to the devil's question. He
[2:19:31] said, "The headship is here. Christ the
[2:19:34] word is here again in this hour." We
[2:19:36] have the answer to the devil's question.
[2:19:38] We have the answer this morning. Christ
[2:19:40] is risen and paid the price and raising
[2:19:43] up the body. And the devil can't stand.
[2:19:45] I said, "Oh, glory to God this morning.
[2:19:47] I don't care what he can't stand. I'm
[2:19:49] going in the rapture. The headship of
[2:19:52] the word is coming this day. And I am
[2:19:55] the body. I have received revelation. I
[2:19:58] have received understanding. I know the
[2:20:00] mystery of his will.
[2:20:04] The headship has come.
[2:20:06] The devil, the reason that he's howing
[2:20:08] the way that he is, his wickedness, his
[2:20:09] scheme has been uncovered by reason. A
[2:20:11] resurrected Christ and the headship in
[2:20:14] his body.
[2:20:16] We got the devil's answer. Not me that
[2:20:19] liveth, but Christ, the word living in
[2:20:22] me. Not my idea, his power. Not my idea,
[2:20:25] his word. He promised it. Here it is. He
[2:20:28] said it would be here. We got the
[2:20:31] answer, brother Creed. We got the answer
[2:20:33] this morning. No more doubts.
[2:20:38] No more frustrations.
[2:20:41] No more highs and lows, disappointments.
[2:20:46] We have an answer cuz we have a word.
[2:20:49] Cuz God sent us a prophet with the
[2:20:51] vindicated message.
[2:20:56] The headship has come to the body. God
[2:21:00] and his church is one. Christ in you.
[2:21:04] And he says, "God's great revelation."
[2:21:08] God's great revelation,
[2:21:12] headship
[2:21:13] to a body.
[2:21:15] Oh my. He says, "We stand justified
[2:21:18] before him because he cannot pass
[2:21:19] judgment for he's already judged the
[2:21:21] body, which I'm part of." And he goes,
[2:21:24] "Justified in the sight. We're
[2:21:25] justified. We are the victory. The
[2:21:26] church is the victory. We come forth in
[2:21:28] the last days with the glorious gospel
[2:21:30] showing his victory. He died for this
[2:21:32] purpose. And we are proof of his victory
[2:21:35] when we see him coming down and living
[2:21:38] among the church.
[2:21:42] The vindicated word in the body is the
[2:21:44] very victory and the reason of his
[2:21:46] death. Christ the word. He was the word.
[2:21:48] He is the word and the church becomes
[2:21:50] the word by making her part of him.
[2:21:53] whole church
[2:21:55] and there's been churches churches
[2:21:58] and there's been brides brides
[2:22:01] down through seven ages. Now we're in
[2:22:03] the seventh final age. There's been
[2:22:04] churches. There's been those that
[2:22:06] claimed they were the bride. But there
[2:22:08] has to come one.
[2:22:11] There has to come one. And it can only
[2:22:13] come after the opening of those seven
[2:22:14] seals for the fullness,
[2:22:17] for the finality, for the finishing of
[2:22:20] the mystery of God's will. There has to
[2:22:24] come one. Then he goes and he says, "Oh,
[2:22:27] he being the groom, the bride has to
[2:22:29] come forth because it's part of him." It
[2:22:31] can only be the manifestation of the
[2:22:33] fulfilling of all the revelations that
[2:22:36] others spoke of the bride. It can only
[2:22:38] manifest if it does something different
[2:22:39] from the groom. is not the bride because
[2:22:41] she's flesh of his flesh,
[2:22:44] bone of his bone, life of his life,
[2:22:46] power of his power. She is him. And he
[2:22:51] says, "And how the bride holds to that
[2:22:54] promise."
[2:22:57] As I end with this scripture, 1 John
[2:23:00] 3:1, "Behold, what manner,
[2:23:03] what manner of love the Father has
[2:23:04] bestowed upon us that we should be
[2:23:06] called the sons of God. Therefore, the
[2:23:10] world knoweth us not, because it knew
[2:23:12] him not. But, beloved, now,
[2:23:16] if you don't get anything out of this
[2:23:18] service today, I want you to know now.
[2:23:20] Now, the bride is coming to
[2:23:22] manifestation. Now, listen to what he
[2:23:25] says. Now, we are the sons of God.
[2:23:30] And it does not yet appear what we shall
[2:23:32] be. But we know that when he shall
[2:23:34] appear, we shall be like him, for we
[2:23:36] shall see him as he is. And he has
[2:23:40] appeared in the word and we are like
[2:23:42] him.
[2:23:44] We are bone of his bone, flesh of his
[2:23:46] flesh, power of his power, life of his
[2:23:48] life. We are him. He says, if you only
[2:23:52] know positionally who you was and what
[2:23:55] you are tonight, there wouldn't be a
[2:23:57] feeble person in the next five minutes.
[2:23:59] That's right. The thing of it is you're
[2:24:01] looking off in the millennium for
[2:24:02] something to happen when it's already
[2:24:04] here. Now, we are the sons of God. Not
[2:24:07] will be. We are now. He says, "Right
[2:24:09] now, right now, this minute, we are
[2:24:12] seated in heavenly places in Christ
[2:24:13] Jesus." Oh, if you'd only recognize that
[2:24:16] the supreme authority that Jesus Christ
[2:24:18] has given to every believer. The devil's
[2:24:21] just trying to scare you out of
[2:24:22] something. He's trying to put something
[2:24:23] off somewhere that says that the days of
[2:24:26] miracles have passed. But you are now.
[2:24:28] We are sons of God now. We're seated in
[2:24:30] heavenly places now. Now we have all
[2:24:33] powers in heaven and earth right now,
[2:24:35] church.
[2:24:38] Now
[2:24:40] the purpose
[2:24:42] of the revelation
[2:24:45] of the mystery has been unfolded.
[2:24:50] Now it's not all about a prophet.
[2:24:53] Now it's about a bride
[2:24:56] who through a prophet ministry would
[2:24:58] unite her to the headship.
[2:25:02] He that this great mystery of God last
[2:25:04] quote made known understands how that
[2:25:06] God was in Christ reconciling returning
[2:25:09] to favor himself to the world. How that
[2:25:12] he and the father are one. how that the
[2:25:14] great mysteries of the fulfilling of God
[2:25:16] taken and bringing himself manifested in
[2:25:17] the age of human beings and in the
[2:25:19] strain of human beings and in the
[2:25:21] company of human beings to make his word
[2:25:23] manifest in that day in the eastern
[2:25:25] rising of the sun to do the same thing
[2:25:27] as a sun sets in the west to make
[2:25:29] himself manifested in a bride church the
[2:25:32] word made manifest. He that
[2:25:36] understandeth, that is to know, that has
[2:25:38] been revealed to him, of him that has
[2:25:41] sent me, has everlasting life, and will
[2:25:42] not come into judgment, but has passed
[2:25:44] from death unto life.
[2:25:47] You are the very mystery of God.
[2:25:53] Hidden,
[2:25:55] hidden down through seven church ages,
[2:25:58] hidden in the back part of God's mind,
[2:26:01] but now being made known.
[2:26:05] Now, that's why this message came. What
[2:26:08] a revelation we have this morning being
[2:26:10] the predestinated. What a revelation we
[2:26:13] have knowing that we come from the very
[2:26:16] back part of God's mind. His thoughts
[2:26:18] and his greatest desire is you.
[2:26:23] In one place, brother Bam says, you are
[2:26:25] the very heart purpose of God.
[2:26:29] God's heartbeat is his pride.
[2:26:33] What a blessed people we are. If you
[2:26:35] just let's just sing that song, Brother
[2:26:37] Derek.
[2:26:39] See, you're not only bride,
[2:26:44] but you're the Gentile bride.
[2:26:47] And it may appear that maybe you just
[2:26:49] you're just here. You just drifting
[2:26:52] through life. But see, there's more to
[2:26:55] you than just drifting through Leoa,
[2:26:58] drifting through life. See, the only one
[2:27:00] that can fulfill the purpose of God is
[2:27:02] his little gentile bride. We are the
[2:27:03] sons of God. God didn't make you just to
[2:27:06] struggle. He didn't make you just to
[2:27:07] barely get by. But he made you a
[2:27:09] wordborn bride.
[2:27:12] You were made to be free. You were made
[2:27:14] to rule and to reign and to live
[2:27:16] eternally. You were made for more.
[2:27:21] I know who I am.
