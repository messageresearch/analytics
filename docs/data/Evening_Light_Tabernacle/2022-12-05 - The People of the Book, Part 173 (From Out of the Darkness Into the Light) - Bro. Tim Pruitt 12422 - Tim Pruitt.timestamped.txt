[1:05:49] gonna be over amen and we look forward
[1:05:52] to that but until until then we
[1:05:54] persevere until then we overcome until
[1:05:58] then we put another foot forward amen we
[1:06:02] progress we move on Amen Matthew chapter
[1:06:05] 4 verse 13 and leave it Nazareth he came
[1:06:09] and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the
[1:06:13] Sea Coast in the borders of zebulun and
[1:06:15] Neptune that it might be fulfilled which
[1:06:19] was spoken by azaias the prophet saying
[1:06:23] the land of zebulun and the land of
[1:06:26] Neptune by the way of the sea Beyond
[1:06:29] Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the
[1:06:33] people
[1:06:34] that sat in darkness saw great light
[1:06:38] and to them which sat in the region in
[1:06:41] the shadow of death
[1:06:43] light is sprung up
[1:06:45] amen looking back over the congregation
[1:06:49] seeing sister Lily back there these
[1:06:52] ought to resonate to her today
[1:06:54] sitting in the in the in the region and
[1:06:58] shadow of death light has sprung up amen
[1:07:02] we're glad to have you in church her dad
[1:07:04] brother brother Kenneth back there has
[1:07:06] been also suffered in Great Waves this
[1:07:09] had to have um some type of device put
[1:07:12] in the heart but he's here today in the
[1:07:15] service of the Lord those who've sat in
[1:07:18] the in darkness and they saw great light
[1:07:21] and to them which sat in the region in
[1:07:23] the shadow of death light is sprung up
[1:07:27] and from that time Jesus began to preach
[1:07:30] and to say repent for the Kingdom of
[1:07:34] Heaven is at hand if we would read on
[1:07:37] and hear we would see that next he calls
[1:07:39] disciples skip down the verse 23 after
[1:07:43] calling different disciples the Bible
[1:07:46] said in Jesus when about all Galilee
[1:07:49] teaching and in their synagogues and
[1:07:53] preaching the gospel
[1:07:55] that's the good news of the kingdom and
[1:07:58] healing all manner of sickness and all
[1:08:02] manner of disease among the people and
[1:08:05] his Fame went throughout all Syria and
[1:08:09] they brought unto him all sick people
[1:08:11] that were taken with diverse diseases
[1:08:14] and torments and those that were
[1:08:17] possessed with devils and those which
[1:08:19] were lunatic and those that had the
[1:08:22] palsy and he healed them
[1:08:26] and then I'd like to look down in First
[1:08:29] Peter chapter 2 and verse 9. and read
[1:08:34] from here as well
[1:08:36] a man as you're finding your place in
[1:08:39] the Bible I want to read about you and
[1:08:42] who you are but you
[1:08:45] are a chosen generation that word
[1:08:49] generation actually means Offspring you
[1:08:52] are chosen Offspring God has chose you
[1:08:55] for this time for this moment for this
[1:08:58] hour
[1:08:59] for this very day of his visitation amen
[1:09:04] for you are a chosen generation a royal
[1:09:08] priesthood
[1:09:09] in a holy nation A peculiar people that
[1:09:15] you should force so forth the Praises of
[1:09:18] him who hath called you out of Darkness
[1:09:21] Into His Marvelous Light amen God bless
[1:09:26] you as you are seated we're going to
[1:09:29] speak today from out of the darkness
[1:09:32] into the light
[1:09:35] and of course we have been dealing with
[1:09:38] Abraham and because it's a prophecy of
[1:09:42] the last days so we will also refer to
[1:09:46] Abraham and what was happening in that
[1:09:49] day because it is a parallel to what is
[1:09:52] happening in our day of Prophecy for our
[1:09:55] day written in the scripture for our
[1:09:57] time and we want to make sure we see
[1:09:59] every part of this word that has been
[1:10:03] spoken of us
[1:10:04] because it was prophesied as somebody
[1:10:07] and so then somebody is the
[1:10:10] interpretation of it
[1:10:11] when God prophesies then there is
[1:10:14] someone who will be the interpretation
[1:10:17] of that prophecy and so it tells us that
[1:10:20] in Genesis 18 1 the Lord appeared unto
[1:10:23] Abraham in the plains of mammary and he
[1:10:26] sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the
[1:10:28] day and then in verse 9 it said and they
[1:10:31] said unto him where does Sarah thy wife
[1:10:33] and behold he said behold in the tent
[1:10:37] you know Sarah was I'm sitting here in
[1:10:41] the tent of her darkness and God was
[1:10:44] appearing
[1:10:46] he was calling Sarah to come out of the
[1:10:49] tent of darkness and despair into the
[1:10:52] Glorious light of the word that was
[1:10:55] being revealed in that moment
[1:10:58] and of course God always has a word for
[1:11:01] every generation for every time
[1:11:04] and God has a word for us today even for
[1:11:07] evening like Tabernacle or whoever
[1:11:10] wherever you are today around the world
[1:11:13] as you're listening in God has a word
[1:11:15] for you today because God's word is
[1:11:18] current
[1:11:19] and God's word is also precise it
[1:11:22] discerns the very thoughts and the Very
[1:11:25] intents of the heart and goes down
[1:11:27] Beyond even when you don't see you have
[1:11:30] a need it goes down and reveals your
[1:11:33] need and brings that out into the light
[1:11:36] so that you can say yes God I do have
[1:11:39] need of that
[1:11:40] and so again we so we we have read of
[1:11:44] Sarah in the tent there as he sat in her
[1:11:48] time of Despair a time of darkness in
[1:11:51] her old age as a forgotten woman it
[1:11:54] seems but God never forgets any of his
[1:11:57] promises God is an ontime God and he
[1:12:01] does things in certain ways because you
[1:12:03] would think oh my as he said I had this
[1:12:06] child when he was when she was young and
[1:12:09] and could have enjoyed him now for
[1:12:11] um he's uh nearly 90 years old she could
[1:12:15] have enjoyed him now for maybe 70 years
[1:12:18] and it would have been a wonderful time
[1:12:20] of spending look at all the time that
[1:12:22] she lost but you see God had a purpose
[1:12:25] and a plan one thing God was doing was
[1:12:29] showing his omnipotence he was showing
[1:12:32] his power of what he could do with that
[1:12:35] not just an old decrepit woman but what
[1:12:39] he could do with an old incredit Church
[1:12:41] that had long forgotten her promises
[1:12:44] that looked like the Lord had delayed
[1:12:47] his coming and had held back the
[1:12:50] promises of God and so again we we see
[1:12:54] again Israel being a woman who was
[1:12:58] similar to Sarah she was an old woman
[1:13:01] having given a promised son a son that
[1:13:05] had been promised for many years that a
[1:13:07] messiah would come it had come all the
[1:13:09] way from the book of Genesis from the
[1:13:12] earliest of prophecies that there would
[1:13:15] come a a serpent Bruiser who would
[1:13:18] correct what the serpent had done and he
[1:13:22] would be the seed of a woman and she
[1:13:24] would come forth and and yet now this
[1:13:27] old woman Israel has been waiting and
[1:13:29] waiting and waiting and went through her
[1:13:31] trials and devastations and troubles and
[1:13:35] now as the Bible said she was a people
[1:13:38] that was sitting in great Darkness she
[1:13:41] was a people who was sitting in the in
[1:13:44] the region and the shadow of death but
[1:13:47] in that moment light was springing forth
[1:13:50] because the Israel as Sarah of old was
[1:13:54] bringing forth that promised son The
[1:13:58] Offspring of God was coming forth it
[1:14:00] would be God incarnate it would be one
[1:14:03] that it would be the greatest visitation
[1:14:05] of God to mankind where God would come
[1:14:09] and take on flesh and here he would he
[1:14:12] would walk there in the land of zebulun
[1:14:15] in the land of nebulon by the way of the
[1:14:18] sea Beyond Jordan in the Galilee of the
[1:14:21] Gentiles and people who were sitting in
[1:14:25] great darkness and they begin they begin
[1:14:28] to see a great light those who were
[1:14:31] sitting in the region the shadow of
[1:14:33] death light was springing up and it was
[1:14:37] bringing the light by teaching in their
[1:14:40] synagogues and by preaching the gospel
[1:14:43] of the kingdom and by healing all manner
[1:14:47] of sicknesses and and all manner of
[1:14:49] diseases among the people and those with
[1:14:53] diverse disease and torments and those
[1:14:55] that were possessed with Devils those
[1:14:58] that were lunatic those that had the
[1:15:01] palsy that were paralytic and he healed
[1:15:04] them this was this was what happens when
[1:15:08] the promised son comes amen he he arises
[1:15:12] with healing in his wings with
[1:15:15] Deliverance in Genesis 18 1 the Lord
[1:15:19] appeared I think those words are
[1:15:22] powerful the Lord appeared because we
[1:15:25] are also in the day of his appearing
[1:15:28] amen and when he appears the spirits of
[1:15:31] Darkness flee amen Abraham is in the
[1:15:35] tent of the and he was in the door of
[1:15:38] his tent in the light well yet Sarah is
[1:15:41] sitting in the Gloom and the Darkness of
[1:15:44] her tent and so she's sitting in the
[1:15:46] region under the shadow of death and
[1:15:50] because it looked like she would just
[1:15:53] die childless that Ishmael would be the
[1:15:56] promised son that surely none of this
[1:15:59] that was promised would ever be her
[1:16:01] promise that it would only be sort of in
[1:16:05] a kind of a way you know through a hate
[1:16:07] guard that this would be but it was
[1:16:10] never going to ever be her personal
[1:16:12] promise and she's sitting in the region
[1:16:15] under the shadow death and yet in that
[1:16:18] moment her visitation was happening in
[1:16:22] that moment the one in the beginning who
[1:16:24] said let there be light was standing
[1:16:27] there by her tent door amen and again he
[1:16:32] was there to separate light from
[1:16:34] Darkness let me tell you he's the same
[1:16:37] kind of God today he is the same kind of
[1:16:41] God that would appear suddenly either to
[1:16:43] Abraham and Sarah and call Sarah out of
[1:16:46] her chant he is here this morning right
[1:16:49] here in this church to walk these aisles
[1:16:52] to speak to your heart to call you out
[1:16:55] of your tent of despair of the tent of
[1:16:59] Darkness where you're in the unbelief
[1:17:01] that you have dealt with the sickness
[1:17:03] that has been there way too long the
[1:17:06] barrenness that you have experienced way

[1:17:56] begins to hear the blind eyes begin to
[1:17:59] see when he appears
[1:18:06] he comes as the one who stood in the
[1:18:09] beginning
[1:18:10] who said let there be light
[1:18:14] and when he spoke
[1:18:16] things begin to happen
[1:18:18] when Jesus began to speak
[1:18:20] things began to happen

[1:18:26] light

[1:25:11] world in the system so quit trying
[1:25:14] quit worrying about it Focus now on
[1:25:18] who's here
[1:25:21] focus on the one who is present
[1:25:25] the one who's calling you come out of
[1:25:27] the darkness
[1:25:29] you've sat there too long
[1:25:38] Jesus said whoever follows me will never
[1:25:40] walk in darkness
[1:25:43] did you hear it
[1:25:45] but will have the light of life
[1:25:49] he asserts that he is the light to the
[1:25:51] world in John 9 and 5 during the during
[1:25:54] the miracle of the healing of the blind
[1:25:56] at Birth he says when I'm in the world I
[1:26:00] am the light of the world
[1:26:03] well you said brother Tim
[1:26:05] that'd be wonderful if he was here
[1:26:08] that's exactly what he's trying to tell
[1:26:10] you
[1:26:12] he's not here in the nail scarred Jesus
[1:26:15] but he's here in the power of His word
[1:26:17] he's here in the form of his holy spirit
[1:26:20] and it's just as powerful as when he
[1:26:23] walked to shores of Galilee
[1:26:26] amen and he has proven to us he is here
[1:26:28] in the world by his holy spirit he has
[1:26:32] proven it by Signs by Wonders by
[1:26:34] Miracles by healings and by revelation
[1:26:38] in Sarah's dwelling there was darkness
[1:26:41] and Gloom but God was there appearing to
[1:26:44] bring her from the shadow of death to
[1:26:47] push back the Demons of unbelief that
[1:26:49] held her bound had to let the light of
[1:26:52] God's word shine upon her
[1:26:56] and to shine upon her then dead and
[1:27:00] lifeless womb
[1:27:05] every one of you have got a womb
[1:27:08] is called his soul
[1:27:11] and that soul is to bring forth a life
[1:27:14] and that life is to be Jesus Christ
[1:27:18] and there she must bring forth the
[1:27:22] promised son
[1:27:23] and so must the church we must
[1:27:28] we must bring forth the promised son
[1:27:32] it is it is a most pertinent is the most
[1:27:36] relevant it is the most important thing
[1:27:39] that could ever be I I know like Israel
[1:27:42] they had given up I know like Sarah she
[1:27:45] had given up but you know in the moment
[1:27:48] when it's everybody seems to give up
[1:27:50] that's when God comes on the scene
[1:27:54] Sarah was missing her visitation
[1:27:58] she was sitting in the darkness of her
[1:28:00] tent and I'm going to just say you must
[1:28:02] not miss yours
[1:28:06] even today you must not miss yours
[1:28:09] he's coming and he's not too busy to
[1:28:11] hear your heart cry
[1:28:14] he cares for you
[1:28:16] he understands your situation this is a
[1:28:19] God that would become so personal that
[1:28:21] through a prophet that he would use him
[1:28:23] to call people's name their address and
[1:28:26] where they were from and all about the
[1:28:28] details of their lives because God
[1:28:31] wanted you to know he was a personal God
[1:28:34] he wanted you to know that he cares
[1:28:36] about and knows where you live what your
[1:28:39] address is what your name is he knows
[1:28:42] about your situation he saw you back
[1:28:45] there when you were scared he saw you
[1:28:47] back there when whence that happened to
[1:28:49] you as a child he saw all of that he
[1:28:52] knew that but he's also got the solution
[1:29:04] I just want to give you a word of
[1:29:07] warning
[1:29:08] don't miss your visitation
[1:29:14] in the beginning and before Eden
[1:29:16] God created the heavens of the Earth and
[1:29:19] the Earth was void
[1:29:21] it was full of emptiness
[1:29:23] Darkness covered the face of the Earth
[1:29:26] that continued and I don't know how long
[1:29:29] it continued
[1:29:30] could have invent millions of years that
[1:29:33] it was in that shape we don't know
[1:29:35] but nevertheless when God spoke he said
[1:29:38] let there be light
[1:29:40] and this is this is exactly what God was
[1:29:43] doing to Sarah he was bringing light up
[1:29:45] on her darkened heart and where she was
[1:29:49] sitting with her Despair and
[1:29:51] discouragement this is exactly what what
[1:29:53] happened when Jesus started appearing
[1:29:55] among them he was bringing those who
[1:29:58] were in despair in darkness into a
[1:30:01] Marvelous Light
[1:30:03] showing them showing them that I'm an
[1:30:06] on-time God showing them I'm the Healer
[1:30:10] I'm the solution to every problem that
[1:30:12] there is nothing no problem that you
[1:30:15] have too hard for me
[1:30:18] now in the beginning
[1:30:20] God showed himself as the separator of
[1:30:23] light
[1:30:24] from Darkness
[1:30:26] for God's word separates light from
[1:30:30] Darkness
[1:30:31] it is the preaching of the word that
[1:30:34] separates
[1:30:36] a lot of times you know when we preach
[1:30:38] and you think well that's hard preaching
[1:30:40] or that was preaching on Holiness or or
[1:30:43] that was preaching against sin or that
[1:30:45] was preaching about what I was doing or
[1:30:48] how I was living or whatever what is
[1:30:51] that
[1:30:52] it's the gospel going forward separating
[1:30:54] light
[1:30:55] from Darkness amen dispelling the
[1:30:59] darkness trying to be to bring the light
[1:31:01] of the Holiness of God into your life
[1:31:05] as I said how long the Earth Set Dark
[1:31:09] and empty we don't know
[1:31:11] but when God got ready to use it
[1:31:14] he had to separate light from Darkness
[1:31:17] when God got ready to use Sarah he had
[1:31:20] to bring her from the darkness of the
[1:31:22] tent into the light of his presence he
[1:31:24] had this separated from the dark spirits
[1:31:27] of fear and unbelief
[1:31:30] when God gets ready to use any group
[1:31:34] or any individual he has to separate
[1:31:38] light from Darkness
[1:31:40] and he did it then by the spoken word
[1:31:43] and anytime he sends his word he
[1:31:45] separates the light from the darkness he
[1:31:48] clear his word clears back all the
[1:31:51] atmospheres of unbelief so you can start
[1:31:54] believing
[1:31:57] that's what the preaching of the word
[1:31:58] does that's why faith comes by hearing
[1:32:01] and hearing the word of God because when
[1:32:03] word is preached in faith what happened
[1:32:05] to his spells unbelief items dispels
[1:32:09] doubt which you know everybody believes
[1:32:12] well the Bible is true well the message
[1:32:14] is true yeah God sent a prophet yeah I
[1:32:18] believe Jesus is the son of God but you
[1:32:20] see it's never been personal to you
[1:32:24] and it's got to be conversional to every
[1:32:26] individual
[1:32:28] even on a even even when it comes down
[1:32:31] to Healing you can know all the
[1:32:34] scriptures in the Bible by his stripes
[1:32:36] I'm Healed you know all this but you
[1:32:39] know he was wounded from my
[1:32:40] transgression all the promises that lays
[1:32:43] in the word of God you can know them all
[1:32:45] but it's got to become personal to you
[1:32:50] but God will become your word
[1:32:53] and this message has got to become your
[1:32:56] message
[1:33:00] now this is what his word does it clears
[1:33:04] back all the atmospheres of unbelief
[1:33:07] this is why this son of man Christ the
[1:33:10] word was manifested he comes to destroy
[1:33:14] the works of the devil men and women who
[1:33:17] were Bound by sin
[1:33:19] who were tormented who were oppressed
[1:33:22] who were in drugs or alcohol or in
[1:33:26] sexual sins of fornication or
[1:33:28] pornography or an adultery those that
[1:33:31] were obsessed or possessed with
[1:33:34] anxieties those that are caught in
[1:33:36] unbelief of the ages of false trinities
[1:33:39] of gods of those who were snared by
[1:33:43] denominational half-truths of people
[1:33:45] Barren and unable to bring forth the
[1:33:48] promised son this this is why the son of
[1:33:52] man is manifested this is why the word
[1:33:55] comes
[1:33:56] to bring Deliverance
[1:33:59] amen I'm looking at a bunch of men and
[1:34:01] women who in your life you met this one
[1:34:05] you stood in the presence of him he
[1:34:09] dispelled the half truths the
[1:34:11] denominates no Darkness he dispelled the
[1:34:14] unbelief that held you
[1:34:16] some of you maybe you never was a smoker
[1:34:19] Drinker liar cusser maybe you lived in a
[1:34:22] religious home but your own
[1:34:23] self-righteousness held you bound and
[1:34:27] you had to realize I need a savior
[1:34:30] I'm a sinner
[1:34:33] because when he when you stand in his
[1:34:36] presence
[1:34:37] it reveals the darkness of the heart
[1:34:41] it reveals why you're
[1:34:44] kind of
[1:34:46] laughing at the promise and say how
[1:34:49] could that be for me it's true for
[1:34:51] others I can never be successful
[1:34:54] I can never make it
[1:34:57] I can never do it
[1:35:00] why you know my greatest you know you
[1:35:03] got young men who's the greatest
[1:35:04] ambition is to be a drug dealer
[1:35:08] or they could be you know make the high
[1:35:10] dollars and drive the fancy car and you
[1:35:13] know and I can make more money than this
[1:35:15] and what I can sweat and honest work
[1:35:18] and that's their ambition
[1:35:21] that some of you that was some of your
[1:35:23] ambition
[1:35:24] you sat in that kind of Darkness
[1:35:28] amen but the light of Lights came by
[1:35:30] your way
[1:35:32] and it dispelled that darkness and it
[1:35:34] brought you out and it gave you a better
[1:35:36] life to live that when you live some of
[1:35:38] you were bound with every kind of sin
[1:35:41] maybe you've been married two or three
[1:35:43] times and you had all this kind of
[1:35:45] situation in your life but the
[1:35:47] lightbringer came
[1:35:49] I need to spell that Darkness he forgave
[1:35:53] you of your sins amen and he treats us
[1:35:56] he man at the same time young people you
[1:35:58] don't do that I mean you live for for
[1:36:01] one marriage one life one wife one man
[1:36:10] to serin the tent
[1:36:12] the word meant nothing to her
[1:36:14] literally
[1:36:16] the word that had been given was not
[1:36:19] hers personally
[1:36:21] it was just its promises were passed
[1:36:27] I'm too old I'm 90.
[1:36:30] I'm Way Beyond barren
[1:36:32] these promises are not mine
[1:36:35] that's the way a lot of people get in
[1:36:37] their times of Despair back in the tent
[1:36:41] sitting in the darkness well you know it
[1:36:44] can happen for so and so but it can't
[1:36:46] happen for me
[1:36:48] yeah the you know I you know we we've
[1:36:51] had bad marriages for how many you know
[1:36:53] my daddy and Mom fought and fight mother
[1:36:56] fought and fight all the time all the
[1:36:58] time and and my my parents they did and
[1:37:01] how do you expect me to be in a
[1:37:03] difference
[1:37:05] foreign
[1:37:09] I can't
[1:37:12] you're going to go right down the same
[1:37:14] Trail
[1:37:15] you make the same bad choices
[1:37:18] you do the same thing
[1:37:21] unless you ever realize there's one that
[1:37:25] is present
[1:37:28] who can dispel that darkness and what's
[1:37:31] been through of a generational curse for
[1:37:34] years and years breaks and stops right
[1:37:37] there with your life
[1:37:40] because today I'd come into His presence
[1:37:43] today my life is going to be different
[1:37:45] today my life has changed
[1:37:53] discern the tent
[1:37:56] God would never be real to her
[1:37:58] in real to Abraham
[1:38:00] oh yeah God was real Abraham
[1:38:04] Sarah in the tent
[1:38:07] to Sarah in the tent you know
[1:38:10] God would never be real to her it was
[1:38:12] just for somebody else the promised son
[1:38:15] would never come
[1:38:17] she might as well just be content with
[1:38:19] Ishmael
[1:38:21] she never dreamed she could be young
[1:38:24] again
[1:38:26] sitting in this tent all her mind was on
[1:38:31] how much inflation was
[1:38:33] my Social Security isn't going to make
[1:38:35] it
[1:38:36] and I'm not going to agree I have enough
[1:38:38] to buy groceries and pay the rent
[1:38:40] and the light bills and Minden are
[1:38:42] really high
[1:38:43] and the troubles that we have is getting
[1:38:46] worse and worse and there's no future
[1:38:48] for young people and there's no future
[1:38:50] for for nothing else and you know see
[1:38:53] you know and the church sits back you
[1:38:55] know we can never have those days again
[1:38:58] we can never feel the spirit of God
[1:39:01] again
[1:39:02] we can never feel young again we we can
[1:39:06] never do that those days have passed and
[1:39:08] you sit back in your dreams
[1:39:12] and yet you can never dream never
[1:39:14] allowed to dream of being young again
[1:39:17] being healthy
[1:39:19] being well
[1:39:21] there's some of you even in your life
[1:39:23] you've given up on being healthy
[1:39:27] you're giving up on being well
[1:39:30] this is just my lot
[1:39:32] this is just my life
[1:39:34] just the way it is I can never be any
[1:39:37] different
[1:39:39] and you sit right there in your despair
[1:39:42] convinced that this is just the way it's
[1:39:45] got to be
[1:39:49] you look at your marriage and you say
[1:39:51] well you know most of them don't make it
[1:39:54] when mine's just running the same course
[1:39:56] and we can't get along and and you know
[1:39:59] we'll never have a happy home and you're
[1:40:01] there in that despair of I can never
[1:40:04] it's never for me it's not meant for me
[1:40:08] or maybe you're single I'll never be
[1:40:10] married there's nobody for me there's
[1:40:12] nothing for me and you sit back in the
[1:40:14] despair in your tent
[1:40:16] or maybe it's somebody else sitting
[1:40:18] I can never have a good job I never can
[1:40:22] be successful
[1:40:24] or as a young person I could never
[1:40:26] overcome this problem
[1:40:28] you sit back in your tent
[1:40:32] and you wonder why me
[1:40:35] why can others be blessed
[1:40:38] why can others get through the blessings
[1:40:40] of God and how come it always happens to
[1:40:43] me the way it is
[1:40:46] well you know why why couldn't I've been
[1:40:48] born a certain way or born in a certain
[1:40:50] family or been a certain way or you know
[1:40:53] how come I I got this trashy family I
[1:40:56] got how come I couldn't had something
[1:40:58] better why didn't I get a better start
[1:41:03] well I'll tell you what you can have
[1:41:04] your better start today
[1:41:08] amen because you are in your hour of
[1:41:11] visitation and no matter how decrepit
[1:41:14] and old and weary and hopeless and
[1:41:17] deceived I want you to know it ain't
[1:41:19] hopeless
[1:41:22] Hallelujah when you put my God in the
[1:41:25] equation there ain't nothing there ain't
[1:41:28] nothing hopeless
[1:41:30] God appears on the sea in the most in
[1:41:34] opportune moment
[1:41:37] to pull you out of that Darkness into
[1:41:40] His Marvelous Light because you are a
[1:41:43] chosen people
[1:41:45] [Applause]
[1:41:49] chosen of God not to stay in your tent
[1:41:52] and despair all your life
[1:41:56] that you don't know my problem my God
[1:41:59] does
[1:42:00] and there ain't nothing bigger than my
[1:42:02] God but you don't know my situation but
[1:42:04] my God does if we can just get you to
[1:42:07] start having the right mental attitude
[1:42:09] toward the promise of God Amen the word
[1:42:12] of God he will germinate in that kind of
[1:42:15] atmosphere where you start believing of
[1:42:17] things are possible to them that believe
[1:42:25] this is why the son of man was this and
[1:42:28] Sarah
[1:42:29] he was demonstrating he knows her name
[1:42:33] calling her out
[1:42:36] God was showing us in this last day
[1:42:38] when Sodom Darkness covered the land
[1:42:41] when many churches are unbelief clouded
[1:42:43] us
[1:42:44] as we sulked in our tents
[1:42:47] that the fullness of the word would come
[1:42:49] and show his power
[1:42:53] it showed us the power over blind eyes
[1:42:59] over deaf ears
[1:43:01] over crippled conditions
[1:43:03] it's power over cancer his power over
[1:43:06] Roman dogmas
[1:43:08] of false trinities and baptisms
[1:43:13] amen the Bible said in Ephesians 5 13
[1:43:15] whatsoever that make manifest is light
[1:43:20] so light manifests his power over
[1:43:22] darkness and when light is sprung up
[1:43:25] among those in Jesus day who sat in the
[1:43:28] region of death unto the shadow of
[1:43:30] Darkness I know when the light sprung up
[1:43:33] it called an ordained men to cast Satan
[1:43:37] out
[1:43:38] amen it was not just Jesus going forth
[1:43:41] Healing The Sick but he was calling men
[1:43:44] to do the same thing
[1:43:47] Hallelujah I want you to know it's God
[1:43:50] it's calling a church in this last day
[1:43:54] I'm not talking about a building and I'm
[1:43:57] not sure talking about a certain sect
[1:43:58] I'm talking about the Bride of Jesus
[1:44:01] Christ and God is calling men and women
[1:44:04] The Cow Speaking out
[1:44:09] Genesis the seeds were already there God
[1:44:11] had planted the seed it was as the
[1:44:13] atmosphere had to be right
[1:44:17] atmospheres have to be right for the
[1:44:19] seed to come forth
[1:44:21] the light would manifest the seed that
[1:44:25] was there
[1:44:27] but until that light came and it sat in
[1:44:30] the Darkness
[1:44:32] in the time of void and darkness until
[1:44:34] the light came it could not bring forth
[1:44:37] and manifest what was in the seed
[1:44:40] the same with the word of God the word
[1:44:42] of God is a seed
[1:44:45] amen and it could lay dormant for
[1:44:47] centuries
[1:44:49] but when the light shines upon it it has
[1:44:52] to manifest
[1:44:54] is that right amen I mean come on that
[1:44:57] you know how many years did did it set
[1:45:00] in the Bible the whole the Virgin shall
[1:45:03] conceive
[1:45:04] and that word late dormant for centuries
[1:45:09] until finally the light Shone on that
[1:45:12] scripture
[1:45:14] by the presence of God shining up on
[1:45:17] that scripture and all of a sudden that
[1:45:20] light that word became irrelevant that
[1:45:23] word became Power that one lay in that
[1:45:27] word all those years begin to manifest
[1:45:30] and out of it came a forerunner and out
[1:45:33] of it came a savior and out of it came a
[1:45:36] gospel and out of it came deliverance
[1:45:39] and out of it came the Holy Ghost
[1:45:43] Hallelujah Michael's light showed on the
[1:45:47] word that had been dormant for years and
[1:45:50] years and years
[1:45:55] for he says it's in the evening time it
[1:46:00] shall be light
[1:46:02] this is the hour of light
[1:46:06] I want to get it to you this morning
[1:46:07] this is the hour of light
[1:46:10] oh but brother Tim I see Darkness come
[1:46:12] out of the tent
[1:46:15] amen do you say I don't see nothing but
[1:46:17] just about to come out of the tent
[1:46:19] you've got to walk in the light
[1:46:23] you gotta see who is here Among Us
[1:46:26] you got to see that that is when he
[1:46:28] comes he changes the whole situation
[1:46:32] now so the word is a seed and it can lay
[1:46:36] dormant for centuries but when light
[1:46:38] shines upon it it has to make manifest
[1:46:44] that's the way Christ shining upon the
[1:46:46] word makes the word do what it's
[1:46:48] supposed to do
[1:46:49] life can only come by the word of God
[1:46:51] May manifest or displayed
[1:46:55] so in other words you see the the word
[1:46:58] of God can be there without life
[1:47:01] Until It's Made manifest
[1:47:05] and when it made manifest it goes into
[1:47:07] action and things begin to happen
[1:47:11] now for example as long as it is lays in
[1:47:16] the book The Bible like this it can
[1:47:19] still be questioned
[1:47:21] now you say brother Tim you know the
[1:47:24] Bible can be questioned oh what do you
[1:47:27] mean it could be questioned it's a you
[1:47:29] know the question can be is it a word
[1:47:31] for a past age
[1:47:34] that's a question is it applicable for
[1:47:37] me because he was spoken to David and
[1:47:40] the prophets
[1:47:41] and to Israel but is it mine so as long
[1:47:45] as it lays in there just in the book it
[1:47:49] can still be questioned but when it's
[1:47:51] made manifest
[1:47:53] then you see the product of what it
[1:47:56] spoke of being manifested then that is a
[1:47:59] light on the word the word said so and
[1:48:02] then when it comes to past light
[1:48:04] bringing Life Light brings life
[1:48:09] hey man now you can put the you can put
[1:48:11] the seed grain of God or the seed grain
[1:48:14] of wheat you can plant it down in the
[1:48:16] basement
[1:48:17] but it will never bring forth the
[1:48:20] intended crop
[1:48:23] oh yeah you can water it and it'll
[1:48:25] Sprout and you know you can you can have
[1:48:27] sprouts
[1:48:29] but for it to ever produce grains of
[1:48:32] wheat it's got to have the right
[1:48:34] atmosphere
[1:48:36] and that atmosphere has to change from
[1:48:40] glory to glory
[1:48:44] understand it cannot remain the same now
[1:48:48] so again there has to be a change and
[1:48:51] and that's what we're saying this
[1:48:52] morning you know the atmosphere to
[1:48:55] germinate life might have been there and
[1:48:58] you might have had that 20 years ago but
[1:49:00] it's time for the atmosphere to change
[1:49:02] where you can manifest any and every
[1:49:05] promise of God where it can bring
[1:49:08] healing to you heal into your home
[1:49:10] healing to your marriage healing to your
[1:49:12] Christian walk whatever it is that it
[1:49:15] can bring healing Deliverance
[1:49:19] now so as long as Sarah remained in
[1:49:23] darkness of the tenth even with hearing
[1:49:27] the word
[1:49:28] she scoffed and doubted the word of the
[1:49:31] messenger
[1:49:33] but when she was brought out into the
[1:49:35] light
[1:49:36] the demon of doubt that it held her
[1:49:39] for years now
[1:49:42] that said I can't do it
[1:49:45] it'll never be me
[1:49:47] I I can never be the real that real kind
[1:49:51] of Christian I can you know it just
[1:49:53] can't happen for me
[1:49:55] I I can never be that in the character
[1:49:59] of Christ I can never Manifest this this
[1:50:02] is too hard this I'm unable
[1:50:08] and as long as she she laid their sin
[1:50:11] I can't do it
[1:50:13] it'll never be me or maybe it might be
[1:50:16] you
[1:50:17] where your your sickness just went on
[1:50:19] for years and I can never be whole
[1:50:22] I could never I you know and you sit
[1:50:24] there in that depression
[1:50:27] that's a demon of despair
[1:50:29] I want you to understand depression is a
[1:50:32] demon it is a shadow of death
[1:50:37] and you'll listen to that depression
[1:50:39] until you become that depression
[1:50:43] come on
[1:50:45] hey man you've got to have a different
[1:50:47] attitude than that you've got to come
[1:50:49] out and say I can I will I do believe
[1:50:52] you've got to come out and say but
[1:50:54] healing is mine Deliverance is mine
[1:50:57] Jesus paid for them and I've got son or
[1:51:00] I'm God's daughter I don't have to live
[1:51:02] this way the rest of my life
[1:51:10] but I'm too old
[1:51:12] Sarah was 90. I don't know how old you
[1:51:15] are
[1:51:19] Abraham was honored that swell up in the
[1:51:21] Auntie a little bit
[1:51:24] ten more years
[1:51:27] why are we putting limits on God
[1:51:31] why don't you be the best you can be
[1:51:32] right here where God has you in this
[1:51:34] moment this time
[1:51:37] why can't you be a testimony to the
[1:51:39] world it can be preached about Through
[1:51:41] the Ages like Sarah was and where that
[1:51:44] she was conceived because she judged him
[1:51:47] faithful
[1:51:49] instead of saying I can't do it he said
[1:51:52] he can
[1:51:54] certain instead of saying I'm unable she
[1:51:56] said he can and said my problem's too
[1:51:59] great my Situation's too hard my
[1:52:02] children will never believe it you know
[1:52:04] that too much unbelief I popped in a
[1:52:06] pumpkin and they've had too much
[1:52:09] contrariness and problems and they've
[1:52:11] seen too much but brother it's that kind
[1:52:14] of people that God takes and changes
[1:52:17] their lives and makes a trophy out of
[1:52:20] his grace amen all you can look at that
[1:52:23] and look at your children and say
[1:52:24] they're going to be a bigger trophy of
[1:52:27] the grace of God
[1:52:29] hallelujah amen there'll be one who
[1:52:32] declares that God can do the impossible
[1:52:35] that he contains the situations
[1:52:45] I can never bring forth the son of
[1:52:46] promise
[1:52:50] but when the messenger
[1:52:52] the son of man called her out of the
[1:52:54] tent
[1:52:56] it exposed her Darkness
[1:52:58] and it brought her into the light
[1:53:01] and then the word was manifested
[1:53:04] and when it's manifested it proves
[1:53:07] it was the light
[1:53:10] Hallelujah you know Acts 2 and 4 might
[1:53:14] be dormant for you
[1:53:17] may not be real in your life but it's
[1:53:19] been Vindicated in mind
[1:53:22] Hallelujah because why you see it's been
[1:53:25] manifested I look over here and I see
[1:53:28] other men and women that it's manifested
[1:53:30] we know Acts 2 is real
[1:53:33] that the Holy Ghost does come because
[1:53:36] we've tasted it we haven't we've
[1:53:38] experienced it it's changed our life we
[1:53:40] are new creatures in Christ somebody
[1:53:42] help me preach amen so you see it's
[1:53:45] displayed
[1:53:48] since light manifested
[1:53:51] it may be Dormer than you but it can be
[1:53:53] alive today
[1:53:58] the sun is God's spoken word and all
[1:54:00] natural life comes from the sun
[1:54:03] a spiritual life can only come from the
[1:54:05] son
[1:54:06] in him as light and in him is no
[1:54:09] Darkness
[1:54:10] because he's god-spoken light
[1:54:14] Jesus is god-spoken word for in the
[1:54:17] beginning what's the word the word was
[1:54:19] with God and the Word was God and it
[1:54:22] takes the light of God to strike the
[1:54:24] word to make it live
[1:54:26] here in the Bible is what he spoke
[1:54:28] now let the light shine on it come on
[1:54:32] amen he said it would be in the last day
[1:54:35] a bride without spotter recall
[1:54:39] Hallelujah I don't care how long this
[1:54:42] leg dormant
[1:54:44] here how many other ages could not
[1:54:46] qualify I don't care how many recalls
[1:54:49] and blemishes were in the past this is a
[1:54:53] new day
[1:54:54] this is when the son of man comes this
[1:54:57] sign upon the word and bring out a pride
[1:55:00] without spotter recall without a blemish
[1:55:07] the light will bring every word of the
[1:55:09] Bible to its right position
[1:55:11] in its season
[1:55:14] and this is the season
[1:55:16] you can keep saying this ain't the
[1:55:18] season I'm past the season you know I
[1:55:20] ate the season of child Baron is over
[1:55:22] the season of The Promise is over the
[1:55:25] season of healing is of a ceiling of
[1:55:27] Miracles is over see the sea the season
[1:55:31] of of the Holy Ghost that's over with
[1:55:36] and it may be for you
[1:55:39] but there's somebody it's meant for
[1:55:42] there is a Sarah on Earth
[1:55:47] Hallelujah the standing in the presence
[1:55:49] of the son of man
[1:55:50] and he's doing everything he can to
[1:55:52] change her attitude toward it
[1:55:55] saying the promises to you
[1:55:58] to your children to them that are far
[1:56:00] off even as many as the Lord our Gods
[1:56:03] will call amen it's for you
[1:56:06] could you imagine somebody refusing to
[1:56:10] say that there's such a thing as a son
[1:56:13] well praise God I can look out to back
[1:56:16] today and I can see it Shining there's
[1:56:19] been a few days I wondered if there was
[1:56:20] one
[1:56:22] dark and Cleary and rainy days
[1:56:26] you know I I can remember the first time
[1:56:28] I flew
[1:56:30] God prepared me when I was 18 years old
[1:56:32] and I went to a meeting there to to be
[1:56:37] with those in a church dedication in the
[1:56:39] Anniston Alabama and I flew from from
[1:56:42] Shreveport over there
[1:56:44] landed in Atlanta in in the midst of
[1:56:47] nine tornadoes
[1:56:52] we went round and around and around you
[1:56:54] talk about flying the friendly Skies it
[1:56:56] was not friendly
[1:56:59] but one thing I found
[1:57:01] that no matter how stormy it was no
[1:57:04] matter how dark it was no matter how
[1:57:07] many tornadoes was on the ground and the
[1:57:10] winds were blowing and all this trouble

[1:57:15] the Sun was shining
[1:57:17] and I want you to know somewhere up
[1:57:20] above your despair
[1:57:22] somewhere up above your clouds somewhere
[1:57:26] about that unbelief the sun is shining

[1:57:33] the Holy Spirit to blow the clouds back
[1:57:36] and let the sun shine

[1:57:45] because of your despair
[1:57:47] but it's there

[1:57:54] a bumpy ride but a pretty day
[1:58:01] I want to say today where I'm at it's a
[1:58:02] pretty day
[1:58:04] this is a good day
[1:58:08] amen

[1:58:33] spirit is coming Marvin's Power is
[1:58:36] coming why it's the day for it
[1:58:42] but can you imagine somebody going down
[1:58:44] into a dark basement and refuse to to
[1:58:47] accept the benefit of a god-given light
[1:58:51] there's something wrong with him he
[1:58:53] don't want his warm health-given raise
[1:58:56] he don't want it don't want the light to

[1:59:19] where God is here in his power
[1:59:22] oh well we don't have the power like
[1:59:24] they had in the 40s and 50s beat me
[1:59:27] tell me is that right no it's not right
[1:59:31] how could that be right amen when he's
[1:59:34] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:59:37] he is there and he'll meet your
[1:59:40] expectations he will come to you in that
[1:59:43] very moment of time
[1:59:46] breaking through your shadows of doubt
[1:59:49] and unbelief in the spirit of Darkness
[1:59:51] where you can see a great light
[1:59:54] is shining
[1:59:59] something wrong
[2:00:01] go back under the shade
[2:00:03] of a tent
[2:00:05] of a profession of a fate and shuts the
[2:00:07] door
[2:00:09] so well there's no such thing as that
[2:00:11] days of Miracles this past
[2:00:13] no such thing as Divine Healing there's
[2:00:16] none of these things that was just for
[2:00:18] the apostles or their favorite thing
[2:00:21] today but that was just for the for the
[2:00:23] prophet
[2:00:24] those men are spiritually crazy
[2:00:28] did you hear what I said something's
[2:00:30] wrong with them that he pulled a curtain
[2:00:33] down and reject the holy spirit that
[2:00:35] could come upon them
[2:00:37] Amanda said if you abide in me and my
[2:00:41] words abide in you then let the Light
[2:00:44] Shadows on the word ask what you will
[2:00:47] and it shall be given to you I mean
[2:00:50] there's something wrong that you would
[2:00:52] reject the god-given sources that God
[2:00:55] has given us to live by his word said to
[2:00:59] just shall live by faith
[2:01:02] how many is righteous
[2:01:04] amen then you'll live by faith
[2:01:09] men shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:01:12] every word not part of the word
[2:01:14] that's why we believe in an open book
[2:01:16] around here
[2:01:17] oh brother Tim you're just trying to you
[2:01:20] know work up some gifts and miracles and
[2:01:22] signs and wonders and then no we want
[2:01:25] every word of God
[2:01:27] amen we're just we're saying there you
[2:01:29] know I don't care whether others are
[2:01:31] denying it others are neglecting it
[2:01:33] we're not neglecting any truth of God's
[2:01:36] word we shall see miracles for we are
[2:01:38] Miracles the miracle has started in my
[2:01:41] life and because of that miracle I can
[2:01:43] believe for other miracles
[2:01:45] hallelujah amen when a man will just
[2:01:49] refuse portion of the word
[2:01:52] whether it's altered calls the prayer
[2:01:54] lines of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:56] or Withers doctrinal things like the
[2:01:58] seven Thunders or the Revelation
[2:02:00] contains in the seals or just as simple
[2:02:02] as one God truth of the Bible there's
[2:02:05] something wrong with that person
[2:02:08] a person had to be spiritually crazy to
[2:02:11] believe in two Lords
[2:02:13] amen are three gods or Trinity of two of
[2:02:17] gods come on somebody amen you climb
[2:02:20] down in your basement and refuse to let
[2:02:23] the light shine
[2:02:25] when God's light is shown in this day
[2:02:28] and shown this as a one God Bible
[2:02:31] and we are one God keeper amen and
[2:02:35] there's one Lord one faith and one
[2:02:37] baptism one God and Father of us all
[2:02:40] come on somebody amen when it's written
[2:02:42] in the word through baptism and that we
[2:02:46] can receive the Holy Ghost that's what's
[2:02:48] given in the book of Acts amen how could
[2:02:51] we go down in the basement and say it
[2:02:53] can't happen
[2:02:55] you'd have to be spiritually crazy
[2:03:01] go down the basement or hide in the tent
[2:03:04] and refuse to see the light of God's
[2:03:06] word and say well but we don't need
[2:03:09] Miracles today I don't know who you are
[2:03:13] you must be some superhero of some kind
[2:03:18] but this old boy needs miracles
[2:03:23] and I don't care who you are you need a
[2:03:25] miracle
[2:03:27] amen well we don't need well that was
[2:03:29] only for a season can you imagine people
[2:03:31] say that was only for a season
[2:03:34] well exactly what season is this well
[2:03:37] this is the wheat grain brother Tim
[2:03:39] where the life is in the Grain and and
[2:03:42] so it's the maturity of the word okay
[2:03:44] great I'm so glad to have that because
[2:03:47] if it's the maturity of the word and the
[2:03:49] fullness of the word and the grain of
[2:03:51] the word has all the word in it
[2:03:54] Hallelujah some Miracles are in it and
[2:03:57] healings in it and deliverance and
[2:03:58] salvation is it and if it ain't that you
[2:04:01] don't have the full word
[2:04:08] you got a Greener at his eight off half
[2:04:10] of it
[2:04:12] in kotlin at the full word of God we got
[2:04:14] grain where's the other half and some
[2:04:16] rat's belly
[2:04:18] saying days of Miracles have passed
[2:04:20] is not the season for God to move like
[2:04:23] that
[2:04:24] I want you to know the word is always in
[2:04:27] season
[2:04:30] come on
[2:04:31] amen this is it this is you say well
[2:04:35] it's not the season I just want to ask
[2:04:37] and I wonder when will be the season
[2:04:42] well Sarah ended up well the seasons
[2:04:44] passed
[2:04:46] you know I I've been in menopause for
[2:04:49] how many years and you know I might move
[2:04:52] my womb straight you know it's just that
[2:04:54] that season's past
[2:04:59] well
[2:05:03] maybe it was
[2:05:06] but the word still got to be fulfilled
[2:05:12] come on
[2:05:13] and he had to choose you to do it
[2:05:17] you're a chosen generation
[2:05:19] he happened to choose you to manifest
[2:05:22] the word of God in this last day
[2:05:24] he happened to select you
[2:05:27] to call you out of Darkness Into The
[2:05:30] Marvelous Light
[2:05:31] amen this is so when will be the the
[2:05:35] season for it I want Jesus understand
[2:05:38] this is the day of restoration
[2:05:43] amen he said I will restore saith the
[2:05:47] Lord all the years that the canker worm
[2:05:50] the Palm warmed the caterpillar the
[2:05:51] Locust I will pour out my spirit upon
[2:05:55] All Flesh
[2:05:57] but you gotta come out from under that
[2:05:59] tent
[2:06:00] that dark basement of unbelief
[2:06:04] and judge him faithful who has promised
[2:06:12] but just because you don't believe in
[2:06:14] the powers of God
[2:06:17] don't run don't mean that the word you
[2:06:20] know
[2:06:21] does it doesn't mean what it says the
[2:06:24] what you know and the man that runs down
[2:06:27] into the musty dirty filthy basement of
[2:06:29] man's ideas
[2:06:32] and refuses a warmth in the life-giving
[2:06:35] Rays of the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ
[2:06:38] which is the same yesterday today and
[2:06:40] forever then there's got to be something
[2:06:42] wrong with that person
[2:06:44] he would rather live in the musty
[2:06:47] Darkness than to live in the light of
[2:06:49] God and of the Bible that said Jesus
[2:06:52] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[2:06:55] forever
[2:06:56] The Works that I do so you do also
[2:07:00] before I go to my father you see there's
[2:07:03] something wrong with that person without
[2:07:05] a question that has to be something
[2:07:07] wrong when the Bible said that
[2:07:10] there's something wrong with your
[2:07:12] experience
[2:07:13] when you say you love God and refuse his
[2:07:15] word
[2:07:17] come on
[2:07:18] you see the church is in its condition
[2:07:21] today and things can't be done
[2:07:25] as God promised because you won't walk
[2:07:28] in the light
[2:07:30] amen
[2:07:31] the Bible said walk in the light as he
[2:07:34] is the light in the blood of Jesus
[2:07:35] Christ God's son cleanses us from all
[2:07:38] sin
[2:07:39] so you see sin is unbelief and if we're
[2:07:42] walking in the god-given light of the
[2:07:44] hour then God takes that word that's
[2:07:46] given for that hour and he vindicates it
[2:07:49] for signs will follow them that believe
[2:07:52] if this is a true word then Mark 16 20
[2:07:55] has to be an action when they went forth
[2:07:59] preached everywhere and the Lord working
[2:08:02] with them and confirming the word with
[2:08:05] signs following
[2:08:07] the true message
[2:08:09] is when light shines on the word
[2:08:15] I'd like to
[2:08:18] I'd like this this scripture Revelation
[2:08:21] 10 1 to be immortalized in our hearts
[2:08:25] where he said and I saw another Mighty
[2:08:27] angel
[2:08:29] come down from heaven
[2:08:31] clothed with a cloud
[2:08:33] a rainbow is upon his head
[2:08:36] his faith where is it where the son
[2:08:39] and his feet as pillars of Fire
[2:08:43] notice I want you to notice his faith
[2:08:46] when God comes when the light comes it
[2:08:49] has transforming power
[2:08:52] his face his countenance the countenance
[2:08:55] of this one we're talking about the son
[2:08:57] of man the standard in the front of
[2:09:00] Sarah's tent his face is as it were the
[2:09:03] Sun
[2:09:05] we're talking about brightness worrying
[2:09:08] there is no Darkness that's what this
[2:09:11] message is there is no darkness in this
[2:09:14] message
[2:09:15] Hallelujah this is when the true light
[2:09:18] comes on water baptism it's when True
[2:09:20] light shines upon the godhead is when
[2:09:23] True Light opens up Seven Seals and we
[2:09:25] hear what the Thunder's letter it's when
[2:09:28] True light comes
[2:09:32] when light comes into a darkened soul
[2:09:35] it changes that Soul where that that
[2:09:38] Soul desires the things of God it'll
[2:09:41] take a woman with with short bobbed hair
[2:09:45] and it'll make her wear long hair
[2:09:48] come on why because light comes upon the
[2:09:51] scripture
[2:09:52] it'll take a man with long hair and
[2:09:55] they'll take him and cause him to go to
[2:09:57] the barber shop and get it cut off
[2:09:59] because light has come into the soul
[2:10:02] that made the word of God a reality God
[2:10:06] doesn't want me looking like a woman he
[2:10:09] wants me to look like a man
[2:10:12] oh well brother Tim I'm trying to look
[2:10:14] like Jesus well if you want to look like
[2:10:16] Jesus with Jesus in that day would come
[2:10:18] on Paul said to the manners to have
[2:10:20] short hair come on cut hair
[2:10:22] the woman's have uncut hair so we know
[2:10:25] that in the days that that's what
[2:10:27] Christians did that's what Christians do
[2:10:29] today and Jesus would like all men of
[2:10:31] that day would take their hair and with
[2:10:33] a knife and they would have to cut it
[2:10:35] they didn't have Barbers like we got and
[2:10:37] cut it all the way around and cut it all
[2:10:39] the way around cut it all the way around
[2:10:41] Jesus didn't have a hair down to his
[2:10:44] waist
[2:10:47] Jesus was different
[2:10:50] he was different he was a man he didn't
[2:10:53] look like a woman
[2:10:55] he didn't dress like a woman
[2:10:57] and when the Holy Ghost comes it'll make
[2:11:00] a man look like a man that just like a
[2:11:02] man it'll make a woman look like a woman
[2:11:05] a lady and dress like a lady
[2:11:08] is that right because it's the Holy
[2:11:10] Ghost comes and it shines upon the
[2:11:13] darkened soul
[2:11:15] and light shines
[2:11:19] takes every worldly spirit away from you
[2:11:22] you quit desire and be like the world
[2:11:25] and the things of the world quit
[2:11:27] painting your fingernails and your
[2:11:28] toenails and make them look like white
[2:11:30] navy bean holes and call yourself a
[2:11:33] Christian come on Amen how in the world
[2:11:35] are you gonna identify yourself as a son
[2:11:37] or daughter of God when you're looking
[2:11:39] like the world
[2:11:41] amen that's all sacrifice fresh
[2:11:44] preaching but it's the word of God and
[2:11:46] if light goes in on the inside of your
[2:11:48] soul it'll break your life subject to
[2:11:51] the word of God
[2:11:53] you'll look holy he'll dress holy you'll
[2:11:55] act holy the painter come from off your
[2:11:58] face
[2:11:58] [Applause]
[2:12:02] I heard a preacher say here the other
[2:12:04] day said well you know I think a woman
[2:12:06] ought to wear a paint even a barn needs
[2:12:09] painting well my wife never was a barn
[2:12:11] and she never needed painting
[2:12:16] amen she was beautiful the way God made
[2:12:18] her I want you to know you're
[2:12:20] beautifully and wonderfully made you
[2:12:22] don't need the world's paint on your
[2:12:25] face to make you beautiful to make you
[2:12:27] attractive amen what a make you
[2:12:29] attractive is with the character of
[2:12:31] Christ comes in your life you want to
[2:12:34] amen don't try to vamp a man try to get
[2:12:36] a character on the inside of you that's
[2:12:39] my family would say that's the daughter
[2:12:40] of God I want that kind of a wife I want
[2:12:43] that kind of a woman
[2:12:44] same way with you as a man don't go kick
[2:12:47] your hair up and put a perm in it and
[2:12:49] act like some something like that come
[2:12:51] on you don't act like that we're Sons
[2:12:53] and Daughters of the great king of glory
[2:12:55] we belong to God we don't belong to the
[2:12:58] world we don't look like the world we
[2:13:00] don't dress like the world
[2:13:09] when light comes
[2:13:11] it attacks the demons that love Darkness
[2:13:17] that
[2:13:18] that fear
[2:13:21] that anxiety
[2:13:23] that depression
[2:13:26] it has to flee
[2:13:28] Paul said the word didn't come in or the
[2:13:31] gospel didn't come in word only it came
[2:13:33] in power
[2:13:35] and much assurance
[2:13:37] and since Christ is the same anytime the
[2:13:40] gospel is preached it comes in power and
[2:13:43] with much assurance
[2:13:45] we sought demonstrated again and again
[2:13:47] and we will still see it demonstrated
[2:13:50] today the word preach actually
[2:13:53] demonstrates itself
[2:13:55] it'll go forth like a flaming sword
[2:13:57] right into the consciousness of men and
[2:14:00] it'll set the captive free everywhere
[2:14:03] Believers went you see the word the
[2:14:06] gospel word god confirmed it with signs
[2:14:09] following and the sick were healed and
[2:14:11] Devils were cast out and then spoke in
[2:14:14] new tongues
[2:14:15] that was the word in action
[2:14:19] and that word will never fail in the
[2:14:22] mouths of believing Christians
[2:14:24] amen we're to speak at where did US play
[2:14:28] it we're to wave it in the face of the
[2:14:30] devil amen we are the people of the
[2:14:33] Kingdom we we sat under that region and
[2:14:36] the shadow death and where we sat light
[2:14:39] has now sprung up
[2:14:41] just as he did in Genesis we said let
[2:14:45] there be light
[2:14:46] and there was light
[2:14:48] now
[2:14:50] so you see could you could you realize
[2:14:53] today that men of Darkness will say but
[2:14:57] we don't need the word Vindicated
[2:14:59] can you imagine that
[2:15:02] people actually saying the word doesn't
[2:15:05] need vindicating
[2:15:08] well you see brother Tim it's already
[2:15:10] Vindicated
[2:15:12] so we don't need it Vindicated
[2:15:15] I want to just go on record that's a lie
[2:15:17] of the devil
[2:15:19] and that is the excuse of a powerless
[2:15:22] religion
[2:15:24] amen could you imagine the apostles
[2:15:27] saying the word don't need vindicating
[2:15:30] could you imagine him saying Jesus
[2:15:33] Vindicated it when he opened the eyes of
[2:15:35] the Blind and healed the leopards and
[2:15:37] raised the Lazarus from the dead so the
[2:15:39] word don't need vindicating anymore
[2:15:42] do you see they were not vindicating
[2:15:45] whether or not Jesus was a Believer they
[2:15:48] were Vindicated they were believers
[2:15:53] Hallelujah have signs followed them they
[2:15:56] spoke with new tongues they laid hands
[2:15:58] on the sick and they recovered
[2:16:01] what was it because the word that they
[2:16:04] were preaching had to be Vindicated
[2:16:07] and the same thing has to happen today
[2:16:09] if we preach it's got to be Vindicated
[2:16:12] science has got to follow healing's got
[2:16:15] to be there Miracles has got to be there
[2:16:17] Deliverance has got to be there the Holy
[2:16:20] Ghost has got to be there
[2:16:24] oh the word don't need been the king
[2:16:25] brother Tim has already been Vindicated
[2:16:27] well why did God send a prophet
[2:16:30] it was already vindicating Jesus
[2:16:32] ministry
[2:16:33] so why did we meet brother Branham
[2:16:36] why did we need a prophet
[2:16:39] God Vindicated it again
[2:16:43] still needs vindicating
[2:16:46] and when it's Vindicated in your life it
[2:16:48] vindigates you as a believer
[2:16:51] is that right amen the word today you
[2:16:55] said but the word today brother Tim has
[2:16:57] already been Vindicated yeah it was
[2:16:59] Vindicated that brother Branham it
[2:17:02] Vindicated that brother Branham was a
[2:17:04] prophet and that the seventh angel
[2:17:06] messenger he he was dead and and and and
[2:17:09] what he and it's let me just say this
[2:17:12] way it's not brother Branham that needs
[2:17:15] vindicating
[2:17:17] it's you that needs vindicating
[2:17:21] amen these silence shall follow them
[2:17:24] that believe
[2:17:26] yeah it worked in brother brown but what
[2:17:29] about your life
[2:17:32] amen they shall speak with new tongues
[2:17:34] that needs to be Vindicated
[2:17:37] come on somebody they shall cast out
[2:17:39] devils
[2:17:41] but then we we don't need Devil's cast
[2:17:44] out every person who comes to Christ has
[2:17:46] to have the devil cast out of it
[2:17:48] you have a demon setting on your throne
[2:17:51] from the moment you're born you're born
[2:17:53] in sin and sheep and iniquity brought
[2:17:55] into this world speaking lies and you
[2:17:57] need that devil cast out of your life
[2:18:00] and let the Holy Spirit come and be the
[2:18:02] King on the throne of your heart
[2:18:07] salvation is casting out Devils Divine
[2:18:10] Healing is casting out devils not your
[2:18:13] devil is casting out that devil of
[2:18:15] unbelief
[2:18:18] that devil is holding you back that
[2:18:20] maybe today is not the day maybe today
[2:18:22] is not the moment maybe today for me
[2:18:24] maybe this is not my hour
[2:18:29] these signs of if these signs shall
[2:18:32] don't follow a church then that church
[2:18:35] is not true believers
[2:18:38] because these are among believers
[2:18:41] the Jews of 2000 years ago went into
[2:18:44] their basement of unbelief yet reading
[2:18:47] the quotes of Moses but Moses words
[2:18:50] became a glare that just blinded them
[2:18:53] instead of Illuminating them
[2:18:57] why did the Jews reject the Messiah
[2:18:59] because they were living in the glare of
[2:19:02] a an age past they were in the glare of
[2:19:06] Moses age
[2:19:08] and that's the very reason that this
[2:19:10] message that Jesus Christ is still the
[2:19:13] same is turned down is because people
[2:19:16] are living in class of other ages
[2:19:20] amen they living under a mirage a mirage
[2:19:23] is something that's believed to be true
[2:19:25] or real but is actually false
[2:19:31] it's a false light
[2:19:33] a glare is a false conception of the
[2:19:36] True Light
[2:19:39] a mirage is when a layer of heated
[2:19:41] atmosphere takes the light and it bends
[2:19:44] it making the sky that should be in the
[2:19:47] heavens appear to be on the earth and
[2:19:49] makes it as a pretty blue Lake
[2:19:51] and you look out there and you say oh
[2:19:53] this is a beautiful Lake out here and
[2:19:56] I'm starving to death for water if I can
[2:19:58] just get to that Lake right now and it's
[2:20:01] a mirage
[2:20:03] and it comes when a layer of heated
[2:20:05] atmosphere takes the light and bends it
[2:20:09] and when you get atmospheres of unbelief
[2:20:13] taking the light the message of the hour
[2:20:16] you can even take quotes and bend it
[2:20:19] instead of and instead of what's
[2:20:21] supposed to be on top is on the bottom
[2:20:25] and you have an illusion and you're
[2:20:29] calling it the truth and then and it is
[2:20:32] real but it belongs up here and if you
[2:20:33] got it down there and it's not real it's
[2:20:36] a false light and it's leading you to
[2:20:39] death instead of light and so there
[2:20:41] again Sarah was sitting there or you
[2:20:44] said brother Tim she wasn't done this
[2:20:46] yet she had a glare of oh my revelation
[2:20:50] of Ishmael
[2:20:52] of Hagar
[2:20:54] but I'll never be able to do this or
[2:20:56] this she's living in that glare
[2:21:00] other thoughts light
[2:21:03] a false hope
[2:21:07] people are hiding the basement of their
[2:21:09] darkness and refuse to see the word
[2:21:12] manifest among them
[2:21:13] you can take quotes and you can do
[2:21:15] anything with them
[2:21:18] but any quote that points away from the
[2:21:21] bride being the final voice to the final
[2:21:22] age of people who can say there's
[2:21:25] nothing too hard for the Lord that he's
[2:21:27] the same yesterday today and forever let
[2:21:29] me identify it it's a glare
[2:21:32] amen God has been in the process of
[2:21:35] restoration since the Lutheran age and
[2:21:37] God is still in the process of
[2:21:40] restoration
[2:21:41] a man said to brother Brandon said well
[2:21:43] you know he heard him preached he said
[2:21:45] while the book of Acts as scaffold work
[2:21:47] you know and and uh when when the
[2:21:49] scaffold when the work is completed you
[2:21:51] take down the scaffold so we don't need
[2:21:54] a book of Acts because he was only there
[2:21:57] for the building up of the church and
[2:21:59] the original church is not for us today
[2:22:02] and brother Brad said I went and shook
[2:22:04] his hand and said I'll agree with you it
[2:22:07] is a scaffold work but said the
[2:22:09] building's not complete
[2:22:12] foreign
[2:22:17] the book of Acts is still in action
[2:22:22] hallelujah amen and I know he's still in
[2:22:25] action I've seen it in action amen and
[2:22:28] we still need that scaffold work to get
[2:22:31] right up to every promise of God
[2:22:33] come on it's the Holy Ghost it's the
[2:22:37] power of God and the salvation
[2:22:39] now so Luther you know would have would
[2:22:42] go to husk he'd make a denomination out
[2:22:44] of the first word of restoration to just
[2:22:47] shall live by faith Wesley had two words
[2:22:49] of sanctification second definite work
[2:22:51] of Grace Pentecost had the third word
[2:22:53] the restoration of gifts but the entire
[2:22:56] seed has to come forth
[2:23:00] amen now so one one without
[2:23:04] justification one without sanctification
[2:23:06] another would have the restoration again
[2:23:10] but the entire seed has to come forth
[2:23:14] now they denominated died on this and
[2:23:17] today denominated and died on that but
[2:23:19] there's something that cannot be
[2:23:21] denominated
[2:23:22] it's the entirety of the life that's in
[2:23:25] there it has to produce itself in a
[2:23:28] bride
[2:23:29] so therefore let me just say this is our
[2:23:32] where the entire seed
[2:23:35] we're not just staying at justification
[2:23:38] we're not just staying that with
[2:23:40] sanctification we're not just staying at
[2:23:43] restoration again we're having the
[2:23:45] entirety of the sea every promise of God
[2:23:49] lays in the seed
[2:23:53] and this is his eight age
[2:23:56] brother Branham said and Paul Morgan
[2:23:58] came home and caterpillar let me use
[2:24:00] just a few quotes
[2:24:02] before we bring this down to close
[2:24:05] and I want to kind of emphasize just
[2:24:08] wake up for the next 10 minutes
[2:24:11] do you good
[2:24:15] Sarah I've let you have your nap
[2:24:18] time to wake up
[2:24:20] the son of man's outside your tent
[2:24:25] listen he said and close to what I want
[2:24:27] to tell you
[2:24:29] the ever presence of the Living God is
[2:24:31] the lifeline of any church
[2:24:34] or any bunch of people that every
[2:24:36] presence of the Living God to perform
[2:24:39] and to do and to act and to live with
[2:24:41] the people as he did in the beginning if
[2:24:44] the presence of the Living God brought a
[2:24:47] Pentecost with power with signs and
[2:24:49] wonders and brought a people so full of
[2:24:51] the holy of the glory of God to they
[2:24:54] shouted and spoke with other languages
[2:24:56] and went and martyrs for the faith let
[2:24:59] us earnestly contend for that Faith
[2:25:01] until death shall set us free earnestly
[2:25:04] contend for it
[2:25:06] he goes on to say if there if God
[2:25:09] brought with his first Branch out of
[2:25:12] that vine was a Pentecostal Branch with
[2:25:14] power and visions and Revelations and
[2:25:16] healing and sanctification the Holy
[2:25:18] Spirit the next Branch will be the same
[2:25:21] thing it certainly every time the vine
[2:25:24] puts forth a branch it'll be exactly
[2:25:27] like that one like the first place again
[2:25:30] he said the martyrs stood there without
[2:25:32] a bat of an eye and he knew where he was
[2:25:37] standing he knew who he had believed he
[2:25:40] was able knowing this God can raise him
[2:25:42] up at the last day because he promised
[2:25:44] it and before he would bow to any
[2:25:47] man-made old dirty rag satellite he's
[2:25:50] calling him doctors of the church he'd
[2:25:53] die on a stump Hallelujah and he said
[2:25:56] let me die in the same place if God
[2:26:00] doesn't come in my generation I'll die
[2:26:03] on the stump where the canker worms ate
[2:26:06] to it believe in that Jesus Christ and
[2:26:09] his church in his word is the same
[2:26:11] yesterday today and forever I may not be
[2:26:14] able to produce it out in all these
[2:26:16] branches because of the old sap lines
[2:26:18] out here of denomination and Creed Cuts
[2:26:21] me off and drops me like a hot potato
[2:26:23] that may be true but I'll Stand loyal to
[2:26:26] that stump and I'll cry that hour will
[2:26:29] come God will restore his church to his
[2:26:33] original condition
[2:26:36] Hallelujah but I want you to understand
[2:26:37] brother Branham didn't have to dial this
[2:26:40] stuff
[2:26:42] he pointed to a God who said I will
[2:26:44] restore and there is a bride who has
[2:26:48] come out of that stuff
[2:26:50] and right now she has got her branches
[2:26:53] up in the light and the evening light is
[2:26:56] signing on it and fruit is coming on
[2:26:58] that tree
[2:27:00] Hallelujah and she's producing the
[2:27:02] original fruits of the tree when it was
[2:27:05] first planted
[2:27:07] because she's predestinated now glare
[2:27:10] won't do that
[2:27:11] the evening light is the only thing that
[2:27:13] will produce it
[2:27:14] and it's the same as the Morning Light
[2:27:17] the evening light and The Morning Light
[2:27:19] is the same what God did in the
[2:27:22] beginning God is doing now what he did
[2:27:24] in Groom form he's doing now in Bradford
[2:27:27] come on somebody amen this is where
[2:27:30] we're at
[2:27:31] amen the evening light brings even
[2:27:34] results
[2:27:36] amen is promised to bring forth the
[2:27:38] mature fruit amount of mature tree with
[2:27:42] ripened fruit
[2:27:44] ah brother Tim that's why we don't want
[2:27:47] shouting speaking in tongues and dancing
[2:27:50] in the spirit because that's gray and
[2:27:52] green and you know we're really ripened
[2:27:55] we're really yeah we're really ripened
[2:27:59] we're really over ripe fruit
[2:28:05] oh
[2:28:06] mature Church
[2:28:08] is one who produces The Man Child
[2:28:12] Christ is an immature church that's void
[2:28:15] of the power of God
[2:28:17] in an amateur Church
[2:28:20] and man you don't expect fruit
[2:28:22] but in a mature Church you should expect
[2:28:25] mature fruit
[2:28:27] if the next election knowledge and
[2:28:29] sophistication is not mature that's how
[2:28:32] they did it in the green stage of Luther
[2:28:34] and Wesley but only when the church's
[2:28:38] atmosphere turns back to Acts 2 again
[2:28:41] only then we'll be we be the mature seed
[2:28:45] that was the grain
[2:28:49] so therefore in order to have the full
[2:28:52] ripen we've got to have the same Holy
[2:28:55] Spirit working in the same manner as it
[2:28:59] did in Acts 2. because that's what
[2:29:02] produced the morning light produced to
[2:29:04] ripened tree
[2:29:06] and so the evening light does the same
[2:29:08] thing
[2:29:09] so there has to be the atmosphere of
[2:29:12] Acts 2 again as brother Branham says
[2:29:16] this and and just to show you this he
[2:29:19] said it takes the spirit of God to bring
[2:29:22] life that life must not come out of just
[2:29:26] an intellectual Revival it's got to come
[2:29:29] out of the Bible a word Revival and that
[2:29:32] word is the same yesterday today and
[2:29:34] forever and when it falls and quickens
[2:29:37] you get the same results you got in Acts
[2:29:41] too amen exactly it always has and it
[2:29:45] always will be because the spirit of God
[2:29:47] conditions the atmosphere
[2:29:50] well we don't want that atmosphere
[2:29:52] brother Tim we we want an atmosphere
[2:29:54] that produces a character that came what
[2:29:56] else is going to produce this character
[2:29:59] amen the spirit of God conditions the
[2:30:02] atmosphere and it brings it back to Acts
[2:30:05] 2 that produces Sons and Daughters of
[2:30:08] God who have the character of The King
[2:30:12] see a word results brings the same
[2:30:15] results of Acts 2 it always will
[2:30:19] and it always has and it always will
[2:30:23] but the problem is
[2:30:25] men take the message
[2:30:29] the pure great
[2:30:31] the pure wheat
[2:30:34] the unadulterated word
[2:30:38] okay can I can say it anyway different
[2:30:41] do we grain
[2:30:43] and it run it down in the basement
[2:30:47] of Baptist theology
[2:30:49] saying you receive the Holy Ghost upon
[2:30:52] believing
[2:30:53] would you believe the message or when
[2:30:56] you accept this Doctrine
[2:30:57] you have run down and you have taken the
[2:31:00] wheat grain down into the a Baptist
[2:31:04] basement
[2:31:06] come on
[2:31:08] amen you see and yeah it may there may
[2:31:12] be some good people come out of that
[2:31:14] it's Baptist and Lutheran and
[2:31:15] Presbyterian glare that says that we're
[2:31:18] we receive the Holy Ghost without
[2:31:20] knowing it
[2:31:22] what we get it today we don't know it
[2:31:24] brother Tim come on you think I'm joking
[2:31:27] but I've heard message preachers
[2:31:28] actually see that we get the Holy Ghost
[2:31:31] today and we don't know we got it
[2:31:34] well that's not the conditions it was in
[2:31:37] Acts 2.
[2:31:38] everybody knew
[2:31:40] these were drunk on new wine everybody
[2:31:43] knew these were under an anointing
[2:31:45] everybody knew come on somebody amen
[2:31:49] that their lives were changed it took
[2:31:51] those who were scared and afraid to
[2:31:54] mentality and made them out of the real
[2:31:57] Believers and said this is that which
[2:32:00] the prophet Joel spoke of
[2:32:02] I'll pour out my spirit in the last day
[2:32:05] by the Light
[2:32:07] by the light is that you receive the
[2:32:09] Holy Ghost as an experience
[2:32:12] an experience of Acts 2 something
[2:32:14] happens
[2:32:15] the Breath of God fills you
[2:32:17] and you receive overcoming power to live
[2:32:20] and overcoming life
[2:32:21] now neither do we accept the Azusa
[2:32:24] Street glare of the confusion of tongues
[2:32:26] and you have the Holy Ghost that's how
[2:32:28] too is a mirage
[2:32:30] it's a false life but nevertheless it
[2:32:33] takes the right atmosphere to bring life
[2:32:37] healing or Miracles and for all the
[2:32:39] words to be manifested
[2:32:42] an atmosphere comes
[2:32:44] because of the strength of the Sun
[2:32:48] now I want to get to you
[2:32:50] your scripture or where you find
[2:32:52] yourself in the Bible in the last day is
[2:32:55] right here revelation 10.
[2:32:58] and when he comes his face
[2:33:01] is as the light
[2:33:03] of the Sun
[2:33:06] no Darkness
[2:33:08] the expression of God today is in the
[2:33:12] full strength of the light
[2:33:15] now again you cannot ripen even real
[2:33:20] word
[2:33:21] in a basement
[2:33:24] you cannot take it down into baptism
[2:33:26] Presbyterian or Catholic theology
[2:33:30] or even Pentecostal Azusa Street
[2:33:32] theology you've got to bring it to the
[2:33:34] atmosphere of Acts 2.
[2:33:37] and only then will it bring forth life
[2:33:40] for a harvest
[2:33:42] now so the glare of another age that
[2:33:46] says the days of Miracles has passed now
[2:33:48] that may have been true in Luther's age
[2:33:53] somebody with me
[2:33:55] the days of Miracles may have been
[2:33:57] passed
[2:33:58] maybe all the Miracles they had was
[2:34:00] looking back to the book of Acts
[2:34:03] but that's not where we're living
[2:34:07] are you with me amen Baptist time you
[2:34:10] know where where that where that that
[2:34:13] all they got was the light of of water
[2:34:15] baptism that might have been okay in the
[2:34:19] Baptist hour
[2:34:21] and they could say days of Miracles have
[2:34:24] passed and we don't have Divine healer
[2:34:26] but that's not true today
[2:34:29] we have matured past that
[2:34:33] come on Church even the Souza sweep up
[2:34:37] matured past that
[2:34:39] and if you don't have Miracles and signs
[2:34:41] and wonders then you're not even
[2:34:43] Victorious Azusa Street you are green
[2:34:46] green green green Green
[2:34:51] without Miracles our bodies won't change
[2:34:54] amen without faith we can't please God
[2:34:57] without healing we're robbed to the
[2:34:59] signs that follow them that believe for
[2:35:02] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[2:35:04] they shall recover without tongues we
[2:35:07] don't have the language of Heaven
[2:35:12] it's a false light
[2:35:14] that says we don't need miracles
[2:35:17] oh it's not the season for it without
[2:35:19] faith
[2:35:21] to believe for healing we can't have
[2:35:22] faith for the change of body this is not
[2:35:25] the hour of less faith
[2:35:27] this is our of more faith
[2:35:31] now listen
[2:35:33] I'm going to try to close on this
[2:35:36] I preached one time last month
[2:35:42] I won't make it all up today
[2:35:46] but you hang with me just for a little
[2:35:48] bit more
[2:35:52] because I want you to see clearly we
[2:35:55] have been brought out of the darkness
[2:35:56] don't go back in the basement
[2:36:00] we have been brought out of Darkness
[2:36:02] into light
[2:36:05] if I could bring this to an applicable
[2:36:07] way of even you in your personal life
[2:36:09] don't go back in the Darkness
[2:36:14] I can never make it I can never overcome
[2:36:16] I can never I can never I can never get
[2:36:18] over this sickness I
[2:36:20] I could never have my children say I can
[2:36:22] never get past that
[2:36:27] this is where we got to come to say
[2:36:29] there is nothing too hard for the Lord
[2:36:34] nothing
[2:36:36] but it looks impossible we're not
[2:36:38] talking about looks
[2:36:40] Sarah looked impossible
[2:36:45] now
[2:36:47] brother Brandon priests his sermon
[2:36:49] called there is a man here
[2:36:51] and I want you to notice he didn't say
[2:36:54] coming
[2:36:55] he said here
[2:36:56] I want to declare he has not left
[2:36:59] there is a man here present
[2:37:02] that can turn on the light
[2:37:06] and he preached it and part of his
[2:37:08] sermon he dealt with
[2:37:11] how that in England at that time this
[2:37:14] was 1963 and you can go and read about
[2:37:18] it
[2:37:19] that in England there was a great
[2:37:21] robbery that took place because of a
[2:37:25] false light
[2:37:28] and there was a train that was loaded
[2:37:31] with with gold and money of all kinds
[2:37:34] British pounds and and the what the
[2:37:36] thieves actually did was they used
[2:37:39] lights to slow down the train
[2:37:43] and to stop it
[2:37:45] and finally you know it come to a stop
[2:37:47] this is The Great Train Robbery of 1963
[2:37:51] in England this gang of men they they
[2:37:54] robbed a male train
[2:37:58] I I at that time
[2:38:00] 2.6 million British pounds I I but today
[2:38:04] it's somewhere like 50 million in
[2:38:06] today's money
[2:38:09] and brother Branham took note of it
[2:38:10] because it was one of the greatest
[2:38:12] robberies that the world had ever known
[2:38:15] of up to that time and it happened when
[2:38:18] this train field of millions of British
[2:38:21] pounds was stopped by false light
[2:38:26] it went from green to red
[2:38:30] now I just want to stop and hear and
[2:38:34] interject
[2:38:35] when brother Branham was here
[2:38:37] I want you to know we had a train loaded
[2:38:40] down with goodness
[2:38:43] can anybody doubt that
[2:38:46] amen my you know it was filled with a
[2:38:49] load of abundance
[2:38:52] and it was headed toward Glory
[2:38:56] it had enough gold to save the Lost
[2:39:00] come on somebody it contained enough
[2:39:03] wealth to clothe and and throw a party
[2:39:06] for every prodigal
[2:39:08] it would heal every sick person
[2:39:11] it would cast out Devils it would change
[2:39:15] our bodies it would Rapture the church
[2:39:17] it was loaded down with goodness can you
[2:39:22] say Amen
[2:39:24] that was the Train the light was green
[2:39:26] and we were on our way
[2:39:29] you know going right down and then
[2:39:32] robbers
[2:39:34] started throwing red lights to stop the
[2:39:37] train
[2:39:38] bear with me for a moment but red lights
[2:39:41] like we don't need the supernatural
[2:39:44] you see that I take away from the
[2:39:47] prophet and who he is only he could be
[2:39:50] John 14 12 with John 14 12 is forever
[2:39:54] believer
[2:39:56] amen so we don't need we don't want that
[2:39:58] anymore so we'll just take that off the
[2:40:01] train and you can't have visions because
[2:40:04] only the prophet had that what the Bible
[2:40:07] said you don't hear what the Bible said
[2:40:10] I'll pour out my spirit Above All Flesh
[2:40:14] and my sons and my daughters have
[2:40:16] prophesied and all men some dreams and
[2:40:20] young men shall see visions
[2:40:22] yeah
[2:40:24] Hallelujah that's what's supposed to be
[2:40:27] on the train
[2:40:30] but the robbers put a red light
[2:40:33] we don't need Divine Healing it's just
[2:40:36] not the age and the season for that
[2:40:38] anymore you see it's the word age this
[2:40:42] is not the age for tent revivals
[2:40:45] well I'm not trying to get Sarah into a
[2:40:47] tent I'm trying to get Sarah out of the
[2:40:50] tent to the light
[2:40:52] we are no way trying to bring back the
[2:40:54] 40s and the 50s
[2:40:56] don't even accuse us of that
[2:41:00] amen we're not even trying to have 10
[2:41:02] revivals my goodness we built a church
[2:41:07] amen we we we just want to see the
[2:41:10] bride's portion
[2:41:11] as it was said in perfect faith I'm
[2:41:13] trying to get the church into a place
[2:41:16] where we can really see Apostolic times
[2:41:19] moving Among Us
[2:41:21] that's what we all hunger it's laying
[2:41:24] right at the door we see it we we want
[2:41:27] to see more of it we want it just to
[2:41:29] flow that it'll be a help to us and
[2:41:32] let's flow out to others
[2:41:35] hallelujah amen that ought to be the
[2:41:38] attitude of the church brother Brandon
[2:41:40] preaches his imperfect Faith how many
[2:41:43] wants perfect faith well that's how to
[2:41:46] reach for you you can't have perfect
[2:41:47] Faith only brother Branham had perfect
[2:41:49] Faith so that's not even for you you see
[2:41:53] that was for him you see that's a robber
[2:41:56] [Applause]
[2:41:58] amen that's a line sign that's a red
[2:42:02] light put in your way
[2:42:04] Amen brother Brandon never said those
[2:42:06] things he said we want to see Apostolic
[2:42:09] times
[2:42:13] amen we wanted to have such a flow
[2:42:17] well Robert say what but a supernatural
[2:42:20] experience with God we'll take that away
[2:42:22] too you don't need that and they
[2:42:24] probably they've robbed the train
[2:42:27] their healing was stopped Miracles were
[2:42:30] stopped
[2:42:32] come on now
[2:42:34] amen I I'm talking about we're actually
[2:42:36] robbers have stood by the track
[2:42:40] and put a red light
[2:42:43] to stop the moving of the Holy Ghost
[2:42:47] to stop the flow of apostolic time to
[2:42:51] stop and they're still doing it
[2:42:53] they'll get into pulpits and they will
[2:42:56] try to stop it
[2:42:58] amen
[2:43:01] and their healing was stopped
[2:43:04] Miracles were stopped
[2:43:09] Supernatural birth gave way to
[2:43:12] intellectual conceptions
[2:43:15] come on Buster Andy isn't that true
[2:43:18] Brothers you've been there hadn't you
[2:43:20] raised your hands your witness says what
[2:43:22] I'm preaching about right now what
[2:43:25] happened men put a stop
[2:43:27] God didn't
[2:43:28] his light was Green
[2:43:31] his life was the promises for you but
[2:43:34] men
[2:43:35] took the light listened they took the
[2:43:38] pure word that took the grade of the
[2:43:40] word and read it down to the basement
[2:43:43] and refused to let the atmosphere of the
[2:43:46] Holy Ghost come upon the promise of the
[2:43:48] Lord to manifest what the truth of it
[2:43:51] was
[2:43:53] all right
[2:43:55] oh
[2:43:57] we have a more excellent way
[2:44:00] yeah we're being robbed
[2:44:03] this you see we we don't lay hands on
[2:44:06] the sick are you spiritually crazy
[2:44:11] are you spiritually crazy enough to
[2:44:14] believe that
[2:44:15] well we have something greater you see
[2:44:18] we have perfect love and it's a better
[2:44:20] way well there's a lot of sickness
[2:44:22] healing I sure wish you'd use that love
[2:44:29] well we but we have a more excellent way
[2:44:33] I'd like to read the more excellent way
[2:44:36] would you like to read it with me in
[2:44:38] First Corinthians 2 28 12 28 and God set
[2:44:42] some in the church
[2:44:44] first apostles secondary prophets
[2:44:47] thirdly teachers after that Miracles
[2:44:50] Gifts of healers helps governments
[2:44:53] diversities of tongues or all Apostles
[2:44:56] are all prophets or all teachers or all
[2:44:58] workers of Miracles I have all gifts of
[2:45:00] healing do all Spirit of tongues do all
[2:45:03] interpret it no that's among Believers
[2:45:05] every person doesn't have that
[2:45:08] but covet earnestly the best gifts
[2:45:13] actually he tells you twice covet desire
[2:45:18] strongly desire the best gifts
[2:45:21] and yet
[2:45:23] I want to show you a more excellent way
[2:45:27] so then Paul goes into First Corinthians
[2:45:30] 13
[2:45:32] and you can put verse 1 up there and he
[2:45:35] goes to show that I could speak with
[2:45:38] tongues of men and angels and not have
[2:45:41] charity the basic element of God God is
[2:45:46] love
[2:45:47] I have become as astounding price or
[2:45:51] tickling sound and then he goes on to
[2:45:53] say in other words I'm just a bunch of
[2:45:55] noise I can have that and not have God
[2:45:58] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[2:46:00] look at that and I understand all
[2:46:02] Mysteries uh oh that throws all of you
[2:46:05] horn Rim glasses out
[2:46:09] come on
[2:46:10] you're about to message nerds
[2:46:13] that have all the knowledge and
[2:46:16] understand all Mysteries
[2:46:18] looking at us to your horn Rim glasses
[2:46:21] saying we got it all
[2:46:25] and do I have all faith that I can move
[2:46:27] mountain and have not the love of God
[2:46:29] the very basic element of God
[2:46:33] I am nothing you see the more excellent
[2:46:36] way
[2:46:38] is not to have is not a church without
[2:46:41] prophecy without understanding mystery
[2:46:44] without having knowledge though without
[2:46:45] having faith without having you know the
[2:46:49] gifts of the Spirit without Heaven
[2:46:51] tongue that is not the more excellent
[2:46:53] way the more excellent way is to have
[2:46:55] the love of God the holy ghost in your
[2:46:58] life with all of that
[2:47:02] and you don't have the more excellent
[2:47:04] way
[2:47:05] without
[2:47:07] the other
[2:47:09] so the more excellent way is not the
[2:47:12] Holy Ghost without faith and Gifts of
[2:47:14] healing or Gifts of Prophecy or love
[2:47:17] which is the Holy Ghost yet
[2:47:19] with yet with no with no understanding
[2:47:22] of mystery the more absolute way is
[2:47:25] having the nature of God with faith in a
[2:47:27] move mountains
[2:47:30] come on how many third pull believers
[2:47:33] well guess what in the third pull you
[2:47:35] move mountains
[2:47:36] you say to this mountain be moved come
[2:47:38] on that's the third pole word without
[2:47:41] that you're not in the third pool
[2:47:43] amen the more excellent way is having
[2:47:45] the nature of God with the faith and the
[2:47:48] moon mountains with Miracles with signs
[2:47:50] and wonders and also to know the
[2:47:52] Mysteries and have all knowledge
[2:47:58] so don't tell me we have a more
[2:47:59] excellent way
[2:48:01] that excludes God's gifts
[2:48:04] because let's go back
[2:48:08] let's go back to where we started
[2:48:10] reading
[2:48:12] First Corinthians 12 28.
[2:48:15] let's go back to there for a moment
[2:48:19] I'm trying to bring this down
[2:48:23] and God
[2:48:24] placed
[2:48:26] in the church first of all apostles
[2:48:30] first thing he did was Call of 12.
[2:48:34] and then second Prophets
[2:48:37] third teachers
[2:48:41] and then Miracles and then Gifts of
[2:48:43] healing and helping and guidance and
[2:48:46] different kinds of tongues
[2:48:48] so the more excellent way
[2:48:51] then would have to include Prophets
[2:48:55] teachers
[2:48:56] apostles
[2:48:58] come on don't give don't get rid of that
[2:49:00] which you don't want
[2:49:03] amen because if you've got to get rid of
[2:49:05] the gifts to have the more perfect way
[2:49:07] hell then you've got to also get rid of
[2:49:10] tongues to have the more perfect way you
[2:49:13] also got to get rid of prophets teachers
[2:49:15] Apostles helps Miracles all of it
[2:49:20] but if you have the more perfect way you
[2:49:23] have God in the ministry in the
[2:49:27] prophetical gift God calling man God
[2:49:30] calling the elect come on somebody God
[2:49:33] moving in the church that's the more
[2:49:35] perfect way it's the more excellent way
[2:49:39] now so there again is the glare of a
[2:49:42] false light
[2:49:43] that says we have a more excellent way
[2:49:47] by not having the signs that follow them
[2:49:49] believe but you know signs don't follow
[2:49:51] us but we got a more excellent way no
[2:49:53] you don't
[2:49:56] well do we don't speak with tongues but
[2:49:58] we because we got a more excellent way
[2:49:59] no you don't
[2:50:01] we don't have healing anymore and I
[2:50:03] can't Revival that's all passed you know
[2:50:05] because we got more excellent weight no
[2:50:07] you don't
[2:50:09] if you have the excellent way you have
[2:50:11] god with that
[2:50:14] so the train was loaded
[2:50:18] but when they got down to the end after
[2:50:21] being robbed all that was left on the
[2:50:25] train
[2:50:26] was a glare
[2:50:29] of a false light
[2:50:31] left only with a false illusion
[2:50:35] and when you have a false illusion then
[2:50:38] you pretend
[2:50:39] listen to me now
[2:50:41] you pretend the Holy Spirit comes down
[2:50:44] when I push play
[2:50:48] as if the Holy Ghost is bottled up and
[2:50:51] confined in a machine
[2:50:53] that's a mirage
[2:50:57] they pretend the token is there because
[2:50:59] they can show the devil a cassette
[2:51:03] that's a mirage
[2:51:05] that is a mental illusion
[2:51:08] others are just as bad they're traded
[2:51:11] the old-fashioned born-again experience
[2:51:13] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for a
[2:51:16] Baptist easy believe in a a Baptist
[2:51:19] approach to Salvation the Holy Ghost
[2:51:21] without an experience and that is a
[2:51:25] false light
[2:51:28] some Churches
[2:51:30] are actually
[2:51:34] agrees me to say this
[2:51:36] but they actually pretend
[2:51:38] they can turn this service over to
[2:51:41] brother Branham
[2:51:43] we are now going to turn this service
[2:51:45] over to God's servant and Prophet
[2:51:47] brother Branham
[2:51:50] and they pretend that he's now preaching
[2:51:52] from the pulpit
[2:51:53] and you expect sane people to believe
[2:51:55] that
[2:51:58] you're in a basement
[2:52:02] that's mental and spiritual insanity
[2:52:06] they pretend to actually pretend listen
[2:52:09] setting up a speaker like this and
[2:52:12] piling up some hankies there getting
[2:52:14] brother branham's voice to play over the
[2:52:16] thing is now did everybody get their
[2:52:18] hanky that brother Brandon prayed over
[2:52:23] that's spiritualism
[2:52:26] brother bradham's not here to pray over
[2:52:28] our prayer prayer cloths
[2:52:31] amen God still got a Ministry on Earth
[2:52:35] God placed you in the church Apostles
[2:52:39] prophets teachers
[2:52:42] God put them there I tell you what you
[2:52:45] cannot take him out
[2:52:47] God put them in there
[2:52:50] but robbers do
[2:52:55] do you realize
[2:52:58] would take the broken bread
[2:53:00] somebody breaks it in front of the
[2:53:02] speaker
[2:53:04] makes it in front of the speaker
[2:53:06] takes the sip of the wine brother
[2:53:08] branham's voice is played over the
[2:53:10] speaker and we eat the communion bread
[2:53:12] and we drink the wine and and then the
[2:53:17] leader gets up sobbing and crying isn't
[2:53:19] it wonderful to have had God's Prophet
[2:53:22] to serve communion to us
[2:53:26] pretending
[2:53:32] so they pretend he's serving them
[2:53:34] communion
[2:53:37] they pretend
[2:53:39] they and others
[2:53:41] bring it down
[2:53:43] pretend they have the Holy Ghost just by
[2:53:45] embracing certain doctrines
[2:53:48] some pretend the Holy Ghost comes when
[2:53:52] they raise the hand
[2:53:55] you raise your hand you know preacher
[2:53:57] says raise your hands you want to accept
[2:53:59] Christ I want to say raising your hand
[2:54:01] is good you made a move for God you
[2:54:03] accepted Christ as your savior but
[2:54:06] follow through on receiving the baptism
[2:54:08] of the Holy Ghost
[2:54:13] you see again again the others pretend
[2:54:17] like I said they have the Holy Ghost
[2:54:19] when they Embrace certain Doctrine is
[2:54:21] still living with dirty lives and when
[2:54:24] something they you know like disbelief
[2:54:27] the sign comes along the cow that cast
[2:54:30] out on the message they'd Fall Away they
[2:54:32] go back into darkness again
[2:54:35] you see it pretend to believe in healing
[2:54:37] but there's little or no manifestations
[2:54:39] of it hiding in the basement refusing
[2:54:43] the light living the glare had they been
[2:54:45] robbed
[2:54:48] and the train that was bound for Glory
[2:54:51] is sitting on the side
[2:54:53] and nothing in it
[2:55:00] by false light
[2:55:04] that's what the glares will do
[2:55:07] it'll give you a false light
[2:55:13] but I'll tell you what
[2:55:16] that's not the train I'm riding on
[2:55:20] this train I'm on has got healing in it
[2:55:23] this train I'm on has got miracles in it
[2:55:25] this train I'm always got the Holy Ghost
[2:55:27] in it this tree now I'm gonna come on

[2:55:40] prophet of God looted the street from
[2:55:42] glory and we're not letting it robber on
[2:55:45] our train with some folks like this that
[2:55:48] can't happen anymore
[2:55:51] because we have been called out a
[2:55:53] Darkness
[2:55:54] into His Marvelous Light

[2:56:01] a royal priesthood
