[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] located in North Louisiana evening light
[0:03] Tabernacle has always held forth the
[0:06] scripture that Jesus Christ is the same
[0:08] yesterday today and forever today we
[0:13] invite you to delve into the scripture
[0:14] with us as the ministry discusses God's
[0:17] truth in our day hello everyone we are
[0:25] the ministry team at evening light
[0:27] tabernacle and we are happy that you
[0:30] have joined with us for this discussion
[0:32] today pastor friend of mine Reverend
[0:36] Henry Greene once said God started the
[0:39] church the way that he wanted it and now
[0:42] he was to church the way that he started
[0:45] it and that is gonna be our topic this
[0:48] evening as we just share with one
[0:52] another things that are really dear to
[0:54] our heart one thing I would like to pose
[0:57] the question to you brothers that are
[0:59] here today really what is it that
[1:02] defines the church there are 41,000
[1:07] denominations each with their various
[1:11] doctrines they have their own beliefs
[1:15] their standards and their views can all
[1:18] of these be right what do you think
[1:21] certainly not the Bible I speaks of one
[1:25] church and the Bible would have to set
[1:30] the pattern of what church that is in
[1:33] there I mean I feel like there has to be
[1:35] an absolute you know something that you
[1:37] can judge by because we can't rightly
[1:40] judge we're going to nomination or one
[1:42] thought by another thought of what man's
[1:44] thought about another man's thought we
[1:47] had to have something that sets the
[1:48] pattern you know I don't think that's
[1:50] what the Word of God he is is the
[1:52] pattern yes
[1:53] so Jesus Christ would be that absolute
[1:57] and his word right his work yeah
[1:59] absolutely
[2:00] which you know absolute it's a it means
[2:04] perfect it's a positive it's
[2:06] unquestionable
[2:07] and there's only one thing that's
[2:09] unquestionable unless his word yes sir
[2:11] he said he was an earth to pass away
[2:13] with my word and never failed as we
[2:16] pondered the word church though we must
[2:18] go back to what does that word truly
[2:20] mean the word church means to call it
[2:22] out so we see that Jesus set the pattern
[2:25] calling those out of of what but was he
[2:28] calling them out of and what was he
[2:30] calling them into I mean when we think
[2:32] about the churches why don't we have
[2:33] 41,000 churches is it Jesus calling men
[2:38] out of 41,000 churches who set their own
[2:40] what they would be denominational
[2:42] background or is it man's making in that
[2:45] regard and what happens is when men
[2:48] start interpreting the word to
[2:50] themselves that I'll never interpret
[2:53] exactly the way you interpret it and
[2:54] you'll never interpret it exactly the
[2:56] way I interpret it so what happens is is
[2:59] men begin to interpret things and you
[3:01] end up with this idea which becomes a
[3:03] church and then this idea which becomes
[3:05] a church and you end up with 41,000
[3:07] different ones because they're not going
[3:09] back to the absolute exact Timothy spoke
[3:12] that but there must be a church there
[3:15] has nothing it's because Jesus said he
[3:16] would return for a church without spot
[3:18] wrinkle or blemish exactly so then how
[3:23] do we know what is the true
[3:24] representation of Christianity what
[3:27] would define that because there must be
[3:30] a truth yes I think we have a pattern
[3:32] lays before us mr. Word of God we'd go
[3:35] back to the word to find the pattern for
[3:38] what the church should be so we'd go
[3:39] back to the original gospel we'll go
[3:42] back to the original gospel all right so
[3:46] then the question comes today is is with
[3:51] 41,000 not churches denominations yes
[3:56] 41,000 different denominations each one
[3:59] of these are saying I am the way are we
[4:02] are the way and yet there has to be but
[4:06] one way and I've just got to believe
[4:08] it's God's God of people and that's
[4:11] still longing in their hearts to see God
[4:14] yes if they want to see the reality
[4:16] to Christ yes there was a question that
[4:20] was asked Jesus they said in I believe
[4:23] it's Matthew 19 they were asking him a
[4:26] question on marriage and divorce could a
[4:28] man put away his wife for any calls and
[4:31] Jesus said that Moses gave them the
[4:35] writing of divorcement because of the
[4:36] hardening of the hearts but the
[4:38] beginning from the beginning it wasn't
[4:40] was also from them
[4:41] so Jesus in order to answer the question
[4:43] of that day or to correct the error of
[4:45] that day he went back to the beginning
[4:48] and the reason for this is because God
[4:50] is perfect in every decision he makes
[4:53] his perfect everything God does is
[4:55] perfect so if we can go back to the
[4:58] beginning which Jesus went back to
[4:59] Genesis to answer the question of that
[5:02] day and to correct the error of that day
[5:03] then we could go back to the original
[5:05] church that's defined in the scriptures
[5:08] and we could see the pattern it would
[5:10] correct the air and it would tell us how
[5:12] to worship God in spirit and in truth
[5:14] so then it would be a book of Acts
[5:17] Church yes sir
[5:19] so then Jesus had spoke through Paul
[5:23] actually that said that he would
[5:25] sanctify and cleanse a church by the
[5:28] washing of the water by the word as it
[5:31] says in the book of Ephesians so that he
[5:33] could present himself a glorious church
[5:35] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[5:40] thing but that it should be holy and
[5:42] without blemish do you think in this
[5:44] damn time that God possibly could have a
[5:47] church that would be without spot or
[5:50] wrinkle or blemish is he truly coming
[5:52] for something like that or is he just
[5:54] taking everybody to heaven the Bible
[5:57] can't be wrong
[5:59] exactly I mean he's returning for one
[6:01] church you know I think that's the idea
[6:03] you find though is that he's returning
[6:05] to take everyone to heaven and then
[6:07] that's where you find in this day what
[6:09] the term we may refer to as easy believe
[6:11] ISM that just just shake hands with the
[6:13] minister and just put your name on the
[6:16] book and you're okay you're gonna go to
[6:18] heaven but if we really will look at
[6:20] that in the scripture and look at the
[6:22] mirror of God's Word that's not so
[6:24] it can't be said well what it is is man
[6:26] taking God's Word to fit his idea versus
[6:29] taking God's Word and fit their self to
[6:32] that to match the word for making the
[6:34] word match how they want it to so it
[6:35] becomes easy believe ISM you can do this
[6:37] or you can do that and you find it once
[6:40] that happens you deviate off the pattern
[6:42] yes you deviate off the word which we
[6:45] know the word is it absolute because God
[6:47] doesn't change so if people explains the
[6:49] word or gives us a word then God can't
[6:51] deviate off his word he's he's infinite
[6:54] we're fine like we change we can change
[6:56] our ideas or views but God can't so then
[6:59] God puts it on paper and then that paper
[7:01] becomes in the heart of man there's
[7:03] gonna be somebody to match it yes yeah I
[7:06] mean I I see looking in the book of Acts
[7:09] we find the church with power in it
[7:11] exactly you know not a not a church that
[7:14] we're living and there's the you know we
[7:16] continue a Peter that would continue
[7:18] denying Christ
[7:19] but once the Holy Ghost came and I think
[7:22] that's where churches are today you know
[7:24] they think the Holy Ghost apparently is
[7:26] powerless but we've witnessed you know
[7:29] the Holy Ghost in power that's right
[7:31] just a moment that a change of life that
[7:33] you don't have to live and seeing no
[7:34] more you don't have to live it he didn't
[7:37] come to save you in your sins you come
[7:39] to save you from your dead back and then
[7:41] in acts 4 it says that it says they did
[7:43] testify of Jesus with great power great
[7:45] so not just word only yeah that's for 33
[7:48] said it was with great power that they
[7:50] testified of Jesus so that power if it
[7:52] was there in the beginning in the book
[7:54] of Acts it must be once again if it's
[7:58] the true church yeah well say Paul was
[8:01] say in the Salone ins he said our gospel
[8:04] came not unto you in word only so you
[8:07] know we have churches with teachings
[8:10] doctrines philosophies you know good
[8:14] thoughts but Paul said but it didn't
[8:17] come in word only but also in power and
[8:20] in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance
[8:23] so then if we're going to have a book of
[8:27] Acts church then we would have a Holy
[8:29] Ghost Church yes we would have one
[8:31] of course had the word but not word only
[8:35] but it would be also in power and with
[8:39] much assurance this is like Paula would
[8:44] also say in the book of Hebrews chapter
[8:45] 2 he said how shall we escape if we
[8:50] neglect so great a salvation so we've
[8:54] got a responsibility to us search out
[8:58] the three salvation and and to find that
[9:02] because he said which at the first began
[9:03] to be spoken by the Lord and was
[9:06] confirmed unto us by them that heard him
[9:08] God also bearing them witness and I
[9:11] think this is key that if a church is a
[9:14] true church that God will bear them
[9:17] witness yes and how he bore them witness
[9:21] was both with signs and wonders and
[9:24] divers miracles and gifts of the Holy
[9:27] Ghost according to his own will amen
[9:31] I think you you know you said it exactly
[9:33] right you found one of the first notable
[9:35] miracles that was done in the church and
[9:38] that was in acts 3 in verse 1 to the
[9:40] lame beggar game you know here he comes
[9:42] Peter and John coming to him and silver
[9:44] and gold have I none but such as I have
[9:47] a part two yes so it's not man's ability
[9:50] that's the power of the Holy Ghost
[9:52] doesn't make a lame man then also shows
[9:55] though there's a power within the church
[9:56] that they have something to give exactly
[9:59] that's correct and that the emphasis is
[10:01] not on silver in gold but on the power
[10:04] that we have to give that would make a
[10:07] crippled man walk or make a blind man
[10:10] see or make a deaf men hear or make a
[10:13] sinner become a child of God exactly
[10:17] heard it said that you know money is not
[10:19] gonna convert the world it's gonna be
[10:22] the power of the Holy Ghost it's gonna
[10:23] freakin the conversion so we find it
[10:26] here in acts 3 silver and gold money is
[10:28] not gonna do the job but it's men whose
[10:30] hard for a flame that have something to
[10:32] hallelujah expression they've seen it
[10:35] because it's not only impacted their
[10:36] life and changed yeah but now it's an
[10:38] outflow it's like you
[10:40] fire shut up in our bones today they say
[10:42] it just it has to release and share it
[10:44] with somebody else and then it catches
[10:46] fire and that person gets delivered or
[10:48] healed or whatever it may be you know I
[10:50] believe that miracles and signs and
[10:52] wonders are gonna follow the true church
[10:53] yeah so salvation is actually healing on
[10:57] the soul round or even the spirit realm
[11:00] but healing is on the physical realm but
[11:04] it's all of what Christ is yes something
[11:08] that that is just marvelous to me is one
[11:10] of the last things that Jesus said one
[11:12] of his party words he says a mark 16 and
[11:17] he uses the word shall with it and shall
[11:19] is a strong assertion he asserts these
[11:24] signs shall follow them that believe
[11:27] seven times seven times with emphasis he
[11:32] says this these signs shall follow them
[11:35] that believe in my name shall they cast
[11:39] out Devils they shall speak with new
[11:42] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[11:45] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[11:48] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[11:52] the sick and they shall recover so if
[11:55] we're gonna be a true church then it
[11:57] looks like we would be a people who
[12:00] practice not just preached or talked
[12:03] about the goodness of God give you a
[12:06] good feeling or whatever but more than
[12:08] that that we we assert the same things
[12:11] that Jesus said that we would do these
[12:14] signs shall follow them that believe you
[12:17] instantly see that coming to pass in the
[12:19] book of Acts yeah right there in acts 5
[12:22] it speaks of them laying people in the
[12:25] street so that Peters shadow may pass
[12:28] over and then it says they were brought
[12:29] all their sick and afflicted and those
[12:31] with with tormenting spirits and it says
[12:34] and all of them were healed every every
[12:37] last one of them so speaking what you
[12:38] said it's kind of a face the mirror
[12:40] moment if you're if you're in a church
[12:43] and you're not seeing these things and
[12:46] yet the scripture is very plain if you
[12:48] believe
[12:49] these signs shall follow that that's not
[12:52] something that's up for debate so so
[12:55] wherein is the issue well I think the
[12:57] issue lays in second Timothy 3:16 when
[12:59] the Bible says that all Scripture is
[13:01] given by inspiration are the anointing
[13:04] of the Holy Ghost or under loaning of
[13:06] God and it's probably profitable for
[13:08] doctrine for reproof for correction and
[13:10] for instruction and righteousness that
[13:12] all may be may be it may be made perfect
[13:14] so we see that you've got to come back
[13:16] to either God's Word as the absolutist
[13:18] of truth it's inspired or it's not
[13:21] inspired if it's not inspired you need
[13:23] to get away from it but if it's inspired
[13:25] then these things are gonna take place
[13:26] that's right
[13:27] well you know it seems to me that the
[13:29] gospel has turned more into an
[13:31] entertainment and this is more of what
[13:34] it's about that they've turned it into a
[13:35] gospel in other words the good news is
[13:38] is we're gonna have fun with dancing and
[13:41] rock n roll and and popcorn in our
[13:45] favorite movie you know and that's the
[13:47] good news the good news is there's a
[13:50] living Christ a man and he's a
[13:52] resurrected Christ and Jesus said that
[13:55] the gospel of this kingdom must be
[13:57] preached and that word also means to be
[14:02] demonstrated into all the world for a
[14:04] witness unto all nations and then shall
[14:07] the end come so if we're here at the end
[14:10] time which I believe we are then then
[14:14] the gospel must be preached and
[14:16] demonstrated and as Paul said he didn't
[14:19] come and word only but it came with
[14:21] power and with much assurance and in the
[14:24] Holy Ghost so this is very important you
[14:26] know um today mission work is done and
[14:30] what we are calling doing mission work
[14:32] is now educating teaching them skills
[14:37] human taryn efforts such as Hospital
[14:42] clinics teaching the hygiene and you
[14:46] know teaching them how to grow food or
[14:50] whatever and all of those things are
[14:51] good but really is that the gospel being
[14:55] preached
[14:57] I think it goes back again back to that
[15:01] beggar here's a man born in this
[15:04] situation no strength to stand on his
[15:07] own and you know the disciples that came
[15:11] there they knew that what they their
[15:13] silver and gold was not gonna make the
[15:15] difference this man needed in his
[15:17] exactly you know and really the
[15:20] humanitarian efforts and the education
[15:23] all that has his place but that's not
[15:26] the difference that where Jesus was
[15:28] speaking about go you in the world and
[15:30] preach the gospel and the difference was
[15:32] there was a power that could raise that
[15:35] man up off his afflicted condition
[15:37] exactly and give him strength to stand
[15:39] and strength to overcome and strength to
[15:41] provide and strength and that's what
[15:44] this were to do this war don't leave you
[15:46] in that broken-down condition he's not
[15:48] here to offer you money or off your
[15:50] silver and go no a power to raise you up
[15:53] out of that place and to make you able
[15:55] to stand and stand in the face of that
[15:58] and you noticed that blind beggar sin is
[16:00] immediately after he was made well he
[16:01] went into the temple walking and leaping
[16:03] and praising God he had a reason to
[16:05] rejoice he just felt that power yeah
[16:07] here has changed his life I feel the
[16:10] church has moved off of the foundation
[16:12] of the power of God and have substituted
[16:15] the power of God for program for
[16:17] organization for entertainment right but
[16:19] but the same power that raised a man
[16:22] that was born lame that's the same power
[16:25] it takes to to take a drunkard off the
[16:27] street and make him a preacher of the
[16:29] gospel it takes the power of God to
[16:31] change the appetite of a man to take an
[16:34] ungodly man and make him holy and to
[16:36] make him thirst and for the kingdom of
[16:39] God and become a child of God and I fear
[16:42] that that we have left the foundation as
[16:45] the Church of the Living God as a whole
[16:47] that men have left the foundation of the
[16:50] power of God and many times it's even
[16:53] said that the the power of God was for
[16:57] the apostles that it it wasn't for this
[17:00] day or healing was for another day and
[17:03] it's an argument that's very prevalent
[17:07] and in the day that we live
[17:09] but that ain't what the scripture says
[17:11] right no says Jesus Christ is the same
[17:14] yesterday today and forever amen amen
[17:18] if he healed then he heals now if he
[17:20] saved then he saves now I mean he's same
[17:23] in every detail you know and so I
[17:26] believe the church if they want to be a
[17:28] powerful Church they got to go back to
[17:30] what was that the beginning I don't
[17:31] believe that perhaps perhaps we should
[17:35] maybe delve into the scripture and go
[17:37] back to the foundation and pull from the
[17:40] scriptures what exactly was the first
[17:43] church and define it by the word well
[17:47] you know Amos 8:11 said that the days
[17:51] come saith the Lord God that I would
[17:53] send a famine in the land not a famine
[17:55] of bread nor a thirst for water but for
[17:59] hearing the words of the Lord and they
[18:03] so wonder from sea to sea and from North
[18:06] even to the east and they shall run to
[18:08] and fro to seek the Lord the Lord and
[18:11] shall not find it so a it tells you that
[18:16] the end time is going to be a time where
[18:19] there is gonna be a lot of deception a
[18:21] lot of confusion like I said instead of
[18:24] one way that we started out with where
[18:27] Jesus said I am the way the way the
[18:30] truth and the life and there was one way
[18:32] that now we have 41,000 different ways
[18:36] and all of these are claiming to be the
[18:40] way to God but surely there has to be
[18:44] one and I can see I believe there's a
[18:46] hunger in the hearts of people today to
[18:49] know the Living God and so the next time
[18:53] we come back we're going to be talking
[18:56] more about this church that Jesus Christ
[19:00] claims as his own because I believe all
[19:02] else's thoughts it has to be there has
[19:05] to be one West and and that one way is
[19:08] Jesus amen and the church that he is
[19:10] called for the last day amen amen
