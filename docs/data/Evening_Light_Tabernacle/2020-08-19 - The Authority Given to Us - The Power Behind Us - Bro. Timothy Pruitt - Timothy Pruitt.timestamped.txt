[27:08] we need your presence father we need you
[27:10] among us lord because without you this
[27:12] is just a
[27:13] meaningless gathering lord of people but
[27:17] father we know that you're here and we
[27:19] know that you dwell among the praises of
[27:21] your people
[27:22] and lord we just ask that you'd be
[27:24] pleased to come down this evening and
[27:26] just walk and spend some time with us
[27:29] lord we pray
[27:30] fellowship lord together with our hearts
[27:33] united with you lord
[27:35] god may you just come and meet needs
[27:37] tonight father there's so many needs
[27:41] so many needs god we have great needs
[27:44] but
[27:45] thankfully we have a great god who can
[27:47] answer our needs
[27:49] we ask that the god of heaven would
[27:50] reach down and touch your suffering
[27:52] children lord
[27:54] suffering with cancer and suffering with
[27:57] various types of diseases and
[27:59] suffering chained by circumstances of
[28:02] sin
[28:03] and things lord in their lives father
[28:06] set your people free lord
[28:08] may they walk out of the bondage of the
[28:10] lord tonight father and
[28:12] lord as we get ready to move from this
[28:14] dimension into another dimension
[28:16] lord may our hearts turn towards you
[28:18] even more we pray father
[28:20] turn it away from this old vile world
[28:22] that we live in lord and the things of
[28:24] this world that
[28:25] just gets worse every day but god we're
[28:28] thankful this is not our home
[28:30] this is not our planning for our futures
[28:32] not here and
[28:34] living for this place is not in our
[28:36] hearts but god we're looking for a
[28:37] better land
[28:39] we're looking for a better place lord
[28:41] lord of the government lord
[28:43] will be a pure government lord a king
[28:46] that will be a pure king
[28:47] father with righteous judgments and lord
[28:50] the spirit of god to reign supreme and
[28:53] the people of god
[28:54] we thank you now father for these things
[28:57] lord that we have we just ask you to
[28:59] anoint it to our hearts
[29:01] lord help us to move out of the way we
[29:03] pray in jesus name
[29:05] amen and amen
[29:08] hallelujah let's turn to revelations 3
[29:12] and verse 14.
[29:19] amen you know i i the things that are
[29:22] going on
[29:23] in the world can weigh heavily upon your
[29:26] heart
[29:27] and it i just wanted to say this it's
[29:30] not going to get any better
[29:31] it's going to get worse and as it goes
[29:35] off into the tribulation it's only going
[29:37] to take
[29:37] degrees of getting worse and but i i'm
[29:40] thankful that's not our hope
[29:42] but our hope is out of here leaving this
[29:44] old place behind and going to another
[29:46] place and
[29:47] but i just got some things because we
[29:50] know the natural types of spiritual
[29:52] we can see the natural where it is we
[29:54] know the the spiritual where it is amen
[29:56] because
[29:57] you know what we're dealing with today
[29:59] is not even a race issue
[30:01] it's a it's a spiritual issue amen
[30:04] because one day there'll be
[30:06] all the tongues the nations different
[30:08] races that'll be there living in perfect
[30:10] harmony and perfect peace
[30:12] why because the spirits have been dealt
[30:14] with amen so we want to look at these
[30:16] things revelations 3
[30:18] and verse 14 these things saith the amen
[30:22] the faithful and true witness the
[30:26] beginning of the creation
[30:28] of god amen we'll let you be seated
[30:38] you know as we just was speaking this
[30:41] world we live in
[30:43] in the natural we're seeing things
[30:45] happen like never before
[30:48] we're seeing uh the attack coming
[30:51] against authority like never before
[30:54] and all attack out even all-out attack
[30:57] against our police force and
[30:59] wanting to defund them and strip them of
[31:01] their authority
[31:03] and you know in many places you can no
[31:05] longer say the whole city is even behind
[31:07] them or even the state is behind them or
[31:09] whatever
[31:10] you know brother branham would use the
[31:11] policeman many times in his
[31:13] it through through his messages about
[31:16] the authority and that's what i would
[31:17] like to speak
[31:18] tonight is on our god-given authority
[31:21] but you know he says we do not believe
[31:23] we have power we don't claim to have
[31:25] power
[31:26] we claim to have authority and he says
[31:29] we realize the little policeman on the
[31:31] street
[31:32] with his little cap sitting on his head
[31:34] the big cars sweeping down to the
[31:35] broadway's
[31:36] 90 miles an hour 300 horsepower engines
[31:40] in them he hasn't got one bit of power
[31:42] to stop one of them
[31:44] they would crush him amen he says but
[31:46] just let them
[31:47] let him show that badge and lift his
[31:49] hands and brakes will squeal
[31:52] and tires will hum it's the authority
[31:55] that stops them
[31:56] he said why because the whole city is
[31:58] behind him he's got
[32:00] authority not power he may not weigh a
[32:02] hundred pounds but he's got the
[32:04] authority
[32:05] to make them stop and so we see in this
[32:08] hour that we're living in i think it's
[32:10] very amazing that
[32:12] that you know that the devil or spirits
[32:14] are actually anointing people
[32:16] amen to come against the authority and
[32:19] the natural
[32:19] and and if he's doing that in the
[32:21] natural he's also going to try to do
[32:23] that
[32:23] in the supernatural and so you know we
[32:25] see an all-out assault to strip the
[32:28] authority
[32:29] of the enforcers of the law and so that
[32:31] that way the lawless can do as they
[32:33] please they can rape they can murder
[32:35] they can loot they can kill
[32:37] they can steal they can ride in streets
[32:39] they can destroy buildings they can
[32:41] destroy livelihoods of people and the
[32:44] political atmosphere we're living in
[32:46] has got the police to be in such a place
[32:48] that they're afraid to assert
[32:50] their authority or what they had because
[32:53] it has been stripped from them and so
[32:55] now that those out there those those men
[32:58] anointed by
[32:59] spirits they can tear down what
[33:00] monuments they want to
[33:02] they can graffiti them they can graffiti
[33:04] our streets they can
[33:06] write anything they want to on our
[33:07] buildings they can do what they please
[33:10] because they don't have any
[33:11] repercussions from it
[33:13] therefore the law no longer has any
[33:15] value to them
[33:17] because it has nothing to back it up and
[33:20] the devil is now trying as we said he
[33:22] said the natural types of
[33:24] spiritual so at the same time you see
[33:26] the devil is trying to strip
[33:28] the power of god out of the church he's
[33:31] trying to take the authority out of the
[33:34] church because if there is no power
[33:36] there is no authority amen because if
[33:38] there is no power there is no authority
[33:40] so
[33:41] why does he do that so he can come and
[33:43] go as he pleases him and to rob
[33:46] to pillage to destroy as he pleases you
[33:48] know
[33:49] he may be succeeding in the physical
[33:51] realms
[33:52] amen but he and and and creating his
[33:55] chaos of an eden
[33:56] and cities are folding up to the
[33:58] political pressures of the age that
[34:00] we're living in
[34:01] refusing to stand for what's right but
[34:03] he will not
[34:05] succeed in the spiritual realm because
[34:07] there's a heavenly government that is
[34:09] ruled by the king of kings
[34:11] and the lord of lords who will not back
[34:14] down off of his promises
[34:15] but will stand upon them to the end amen
[34:18] we see that there are people that have
[34:20] have stood up on laws they've stood up
[34:23] on things and they've stood for
[34:24] rights they've stood for things and all
[34:26] of a sudden all of that is being washed
[34:28] away
[34:29] governments no longer have the power
[34:31] that they once had they no longer have
[34:33] the backbone
[34:34] that they once had but you know and he's
[34:36] trying to bring that
[34:37] also into the spiritual realm into the
[34:40] church of the living god
[34:41] but there's still authority in the
[34:43] church backed by the power of god
[34:45] there's still authority in the church of
[34:47] the living god to tell cancer
[34:49] to take your hands off of god's property
[34:51] amen
[34:52] they may not have the authority to tell
[34:54] them not to burn a building or
[34:56] or not to root or not to do this or that
[34:58] but in the spiritual realm there is
[35:00] still a people upon this earth
[35:02] that has the backbone given to them by

[38:27] to our description
[38:29] for our age his description of himself

[38:37] and true witness the beginning of the
[38:39] creation of god

[38:44] himself
[38:45] the attributes of our lord and savior
[38:48] jesus christ these words amen just makes
[38:51] you want to shout
[38:52] because he's talking about himself in my
[38:55] age
[38:57] in the time that i'm living in he's
[38:58] faithful
[39:00] in the time i'm living in he's a true
[39:02] witness in the time i'm living in he's a
[39:05] final voice
[39:06] or a final say to my situation
[39:10] i don't know you the devil passed
[39:11] judgments on some of you a long time ago
[39:14] and said you'd nothing be it but to be a
[39:16] bar room flyer or some druggie on the
[39:18] streets
[39:18] that was his judgment but he didn't have
[39:20] the final say
[39:22] there was another voice that spoke that
[39:24] had authority
[39:25] and the power to back it up the power to
[39:29] break the chains off of you
[39:30] the power to take sin off of you the
[39:33] power to break every
[39:34] kind of spirit off of you amen that's
[39:37] the power i'm talking about
[39:38] that's in the church of the living god
[39:40] tonight and he's in our
[39:42] age that way he's a faithful witness
[39:45] he's a faithful god amen if he brings
[39:48] such a spirit
[39:49] of reality in your heart when you
[39:51] realize he's faithful
[39:53] and true he's the amen the beginning of
[39:55] the creation of god
[39:57] this is jesus giving us him a
[39:59] description
[40:00] of himself in relation to the time that
[40:03] you're living in
[40:05] the last age as the days of grace are
[40:08] winding up
[40:09] he has looked from the first century all
[40:11] the way down to the 20th
[40:13] and told us all things concerning these
[40:15] ages
[40:16] before he reveals the characteristics of
[40:18] the last age to us
[40:20] he gives one final look to his own
[40:23] gracious
[40:24] and supreme deity this is the capstone
[40:27] revelation
[40:28] of himself listen to me children of god
[40:31] i
[40:31] am the amen i am the faithful
[40:34] and true witness i am the beginning of
[40:36] the creation of god
[40:38] thus saith thee amen jesus is the amen
[40:42] of god
[40:43] jesus isn't so let it be of god amen so
[40:46] you're not
[40:47] backed by some measly government made by
[40:50] man and we're under a government that
[40:53] was
[40:54] it was depicted to be a christian
[40:56] government that was it was wrote by
[40:57] christian people
[40:59] it's a far cry from that today because
[41:02] it's moved from its landmarks it's moved
[41:04] from its monuments
[41:05] it's moved from it but i'm talking about
[41:07] a government that won't move
[41:10] you can be in the worst trial of your
[41:12] life and he's still a faithful and true
[41:14] witness
[41:15] he's still the amen of god it says the
[41:17] devil is not going to have dominion over
[41:19] here
[41:19] you are my child
[41:23] hallelujah it stands for finality
[41:27] finality in other words when he says
[41:30] amen and he puts it to it
[41:31] that's all there is to it ain't nothing
[41:33] the devil can say about it
[41:36] hallelujah if he says you're healed
[41:39] you're healed if he says you're my son
[41:43] you're his son the devil can help how
[41:46] the devil can halt
[41:48] the devil can do whatever scream and
[41:49] holler he can do everything he wants to
[41:52] do
[41:52] he can make the symptoms gets worse he
[41:54] can do whatever he wants to it does not
[41:56] change anything the final voice has
[41:59] spoke
[41:59] on your behalf
[42:03] mercy it stands for approval
[42:06] it stands for prevailing promises it
[42:09] stands for
[42:09] unchoosed unchanging promises it stands
[42:12] a man stands for the seal of god
[42:16] that's why i love this message because
[42:20] the angel of god
[42:21] the angel of the lord would come behind
[42:23] every sermon and say
[42:25] amen
[42:29] hallelujah tell me another message that
[42:31] he did that too
[42:35] he would come you know if brother brown
[42:36] would make the challenge many times if
[42:38] i've told the truth
[42:39] he will come amen if what i've said is
[42:43] the truth
[42:44] let him come amen he would come
[42:48] and reveal the hearts as he did 2000
[42:50] years ago
[42:51] as he did in the days of abraham
[42:54] hallelujah
[42:55] he would come what was he doing he was
[42:57] saying amen
[42:59] amen amen oh hallelujah
[43:03] you have a message today that's backed
[43:05] up by not my amen
[43:07] but the amen of god
[43:16] it stands for unchanging promises
[43:20] oh we got a change in government
[43:25] changing every day rapidly changing
[43:28] every day
[43:29] so rapidly that even the best lawyers
[43:31] can't keep up with the changes that are
[43:32] taking place
[43:34] changing every day going along a certain
[43:37] line
[43:37] going further and further away from god
[43:40] changing every day
[43:42] amen uh you know but we're we're we're
[43:45] not under that government sure
[43:47] as an american citizen but i'm not
[43:49] talking to you tonight as an american
[43:50] citizen
[43:51] i'm talking to you as a citizen of
[43:53] another kingdom
[43:55] hallelujah amen i believe that's how we
[43:57] ought to live our lives as a citizen of
[43:59] another kingdom
[44:01] amen that this world is not my home i'm
[44:04] just passing through
[44:05] amen they can do whatever they want to
[44:07] they can ride on the streets it's not my
[44:09] streets
[44:12] not my buildings it's not my it's just a
[44:14] temporary dwelling place
[44:16] one day it's going to be all mine
[44:20] one day it's going to be all yours and
[44:22] we'll walk out on the ashes of the
[44:24] wicked but until that day let them have
[44:26] it
[44:26] well we are coming back to claim what is
[44:29] rightfully ours
[44:35] brother brown would tie this in with the
[44:37] old testament he would bring it
[44:39] to show that the god of the old
[44:41] testament is the jesus of the new
[44:43] and he read out isaiah 65 and 16
[44:46] said that he that blesses himself in the
[44:48] earth shall bless himself
[44:50] in the god of truth brother i don't say
[44:52] that was really interpreted
[44:54] the god of the the god of the amen
[44:57] and i went and read it in the amplified
[44:59] version it says so it shall be
[45:01] that he who invokes a blessing on
[45:03] himself in the land shall do so
[45:05] by saying the god of truth the a
[45:08] man bless me
[45:12] hallelujah oh if the amen blesses you
[45:15] what does it matter what anything else
[45:17] does to you
[45:19] do you want you understand what blessing
[45:21] you are under tonight
[45:22] you're not on the blessing of some some
[45:24] feeble government
[45:26] well i have you to know the government's
[45:28] about to bless us with a with another
[45:30] check well who cares
[45:32] that's not the check or the approval
[45:34] that i'm looking forward to
[45:36] that's a money that won't be here in
[45:38] just a few days be gone
[45:40] but you're not under just a blessing of
[45:42] some earthly government you're under the
[45:44] blessing
[45:45] of the most high god and under that
[45:48] blessing
[45:49] who can curse you
[45:53] his cursing to be turned to blessings
[45:57] hallelujah may the god of truth the amen
[46:01] bless me and who taketh the oath in the
[46:03] land shall swear by the god of truth
[46:05] the amen the faith and faithfulness to
[46:08] his promises
[46:09] because the formal troubles are
[46:12] forgotten
[46:12] and because they are hidden from my eyes
[46:16] and this is what he would go on to say
[46:17] you can read that on down to verse 16
[46:19] but to save a little time he said see
[46:21] the real translation is not just the god
[46:24] of truth
[46:25] it's the god of the amen
[46:29] amen and we should and we read it and we
[46:32] read it so blessed
[46:33] bless himself in the god of the amen
[46:37] he that sweareth in the earth shall
[46:38] swear by the god of the amen because the
[46:41] formal troubles are forgotten
[46:43] because they're hid from my eyes he says
[46:45] it goes on he says hallelujah
[46:47] see here is the jehovah of the old
[46:50] testament
[46:50] the god of the amen here's jesus of the
[46:54] new testament
[46:55] the god of the amen
[46:59] hear o israel the lord thy god is one
[47:01] god
[47:02] there it is again the jehovah the old
[47:04] testament is the jesus of the new
[47:07] hero israel the lord thy god is one god
[47:10] the old testament the new testament does
[47:12] not reveal another god
[47:14] it reveals a further revelation of the
[47:16] one and same god
[47:18] christ did not come to make himself
[47:20] known he didn't come to reveal the son
[47:22] he came to make the father known he
[47:24] never talked about two gods he talked
[47:26] about one god
[47:27] jesus is god he and the father is one
[47:31] there is one god in his name is the lord
[47:34] jesus christ
[47:36] he is the god of the amen
[47:40] and he said whatever you ask in my name
[47:43] i'll do it
[47:45] i'll put my amen on it
[47:50] he never changes
[47:53] well blessed be the name of the lord i
[47:56] don't know about you but i love serving
[47:57] a god that don't change his mind
[48:01] how terrible would it be that you got up
[48:03] this morning saved
[48:04] and the next day he told you you're lost
[48:08] well the next day you know i'm sorry i
[48:10] got you mixed up with somebody
[48:12] you're saved and one day
[48:16] he forgives you of your sins and the
[48:17] next day he said hey
[48:19] i i can't quite get over that when
[48:21] you're going to do some more repentance
[48:25] in other words he'd be human
[48:28] hello somebody but this god never
[48:32] changes
[48:34] therefore if he put his finality upon
[48:36] you is a man
[48:38] upon you he cannot change his mind
[48:42] if he said you're my child you are his
[48:44] child
[48:46] the devil can do what he wants the devil
[48:48] can try everything he's got
[48:50] but he don't have enough because god
[48:52] doesn't put the final voice upon you
[48:55] amen you're not under the voice of me of
[48:57] a mere man
[48:58] you're not under the regulation of a
[49:00] mere man this message is not the message
[49:02] of a mere man
[49:04] this message is not the message that was
[49:06] said of the great kentucky
[49:08] preacher it's not the my message it's a
[49:10] message of almighty god
[49:12] that is what we are under the amen
[49:19] he put his amen on you and what he does
[49:22] never changes
[49:25] what he says stands fast
[49:30] hallelujah he called us the true saiyans
[49:32] of god

[49:36] say these are the true saiyans of god
[49:38] who is he talking about
[49:39] you the spoken word of god in this time
[49:43] you're the true saiyans of god

[49:50] so he said you're the true saiyans of
[49:52] god god spoke you out you can't do
[49:54] nothing but win

[50:11] for it to rule over you

[50:25] and let me say this right now when
[50:27] there's no more cancer
[50:29] when there's no more anxiety when
[50:30] there's no more fear
[50:32] and there's no more alopecia and there's
[50:34] no more brain bleed
[50:35] there's no more high blood pressure
[50:37] there's no matter whatever kind of
[50:38] sickness you want to name
[50:40] no matter what kind of set sin you want
[50:42] to name when there's no more
[50:43] devil you shall remain
[50:49] hallelujah it's time you look the devil
[50:52] in the face
[50:53] and say boy when you're long gone i'm
[50:55] still going to be here
[50:57] because i am the true saiyans of god
[51:01] and i will remain he does it
[51:04] and it's done forever no one can take
[51:06] from what he says or add to it so let it
[51:09] be a man
[51:10] so let it be aren't you glad we serve
[51:12] that kind of god
[51:16] you know exactly where you are with him
[51:18] at any time at all times
[51:20] he's the amen of god and won't change
[51:23] these things saith amen
[51:26] it means that whatever he said is final
[51:30] you don't have to worry about him
[51:31] changing his mind tomorrow about a
[51:33] certain thing
[51:34] so if yeah if there's if there's a a way
[51:37] to dress
[51:38] when he first spoke it it still goes
[51:40] today there's a way to
[51:42] wear your hair when he first spoke it it
[51:44] still goes today it was a way of life
[51:46] that his first focus still goes today i
[51:48] know the world don't believe that
[51:50] but i want you to understand it's the
[51:52] world that changed not god
[51:59] he said well i'll tell you what these
[52:02] men hugging up with me and makes me sick
[52:04] dressing like women makes me sick
[52:06] well men dressing like women makes you
[52:10] sick
[52:10] how long has it been since you got sick
[52:12] at a moment dressed like a man
[52:17] same thing it's spirits but what happens
[52:20] over time i i get we get numb to it and
[52:24] you know laodicea is there as sandpaper
[52:26] shaving off convictions and shaving off
[52:28] all kinds of things and lukewarmness
[52:30] comes in all kinds and to where we get
[52:32] lukewarm to it
[52:33] don't even nauseate us no more
[52:37] hello somebody it don't even turn our
[52:39] stomach no more now
[52:40] all of a sudden something new comes in
[52:42] and it turns our stomach it won't be too
[52:44] long and it won't turn your stomach no
[52:45] more
[52:50] it's the lukewarmness is laodicea
[52:57] but what he said is finally
[53:00] it means that whatever he said in the
[53:02] first age or
[53:03] into the second ages to all the ages
[53:05] about his true church
[53:07] and about the false vine is exactly
[53:09] still right
[53:10] and it won't change it means that
[53:13] what he started out in genesis he will
[53:15] finish in revelation
[53:16] for he has to for he is the amen so let
[53:19] it be
[53:20] so we can see again why the devil hates
[53:22] revelation or genesis to revelations
[53:25] he hates the truth
[53:29] so these are not people that are hating
[53:30] the truth these are spirits that are in
[53:33] people that are hating the truth
[53:35] as i said we're not we're not facing
[53:37] race issues
[53:38] we're facing spiritual issues
[53:41] a spiritual warfare that's being poured
[53:44] out into human beings
[53:46] because when these spirits are done away
[53:48] with they'll be every race lived
[53:50] together in peace
[53:54] you know i want to tell some people i
[53:56] just seen some stuff on facebook it's a
[53:58] bunch of nonsense
[54:00] we got ministers joining up and making
[54:02] these things about
[54:03] it goes to take a survey about is there
[54:05] any racism in the message
[54:07] that's nonsense in this message
[54:10] a true believer there's no racism
[54:14] the problem is you got racism in your
[54:16] own heart
[54:18] get the holy ghost and it'll take care
[54:20] of it it'll make over

[56:02] cancer
[56:03] and they're rising above sugar diabetes
[56:05] and they're rising to go above every
[56:07] spirit of sin

[57:00] your government not may not be faithful
[57:02] to you but this god is faithful
[57:05] you know he says how we talk about a
[57:07] great unchanging god
[57:08] whose words does not change and when we
[57:10] speak of him after that manner
[57:12] we get the view sometimes of him being
[57:14] very impersonal
[57:15] but he said as though god made the whole
[57:17] universe and the laws that pertain to it
[57:19] then stands back
[57:20] and becomes a great impersonal god it is
[57:23] though god made a way of salvation for
[57:25] lost mankind
[57:27] that way being the cross and then when
[57:29] the death of christ
[57:30] is atoned for our sins and his
[57:32] resurrection gave us an open door to him
[57:34] god just folded his arms up and stood
[57:36] back it is if
[57:38] as if we majored in believing in a great
[57:40] creator who created and lost personal
[57:42] interest in his creation
[57:44] but he said i like i now say that is how
[57:46] too many people
[57:47] are apt to think but that's the wrong
[57:49] thinking
[57:50] for god is governing in the affairs of
[57:53] men

[1:01:23] hardly worth a few pennies
[1:01:25] and there's millions of them and god's
[1:01:26] got his eye on every one of them
[1:01:28] and he knows when one falls but if he
[1:01:30] knows when a little bird falls on the

[1:01:58] he is there to enforce he is there to
[1:02:00] tell satan no more
[1:02:02] he is there to tell satan give it back
[1:02:08] to restore it back to its rightful owner
[1:02:11] that's the age that we're living in
[1:02:15] one day satan held something over men
[1:02:17] and through the dark ages they only had
[1:02:19] a portion of the spirit
[1:02:20] but this day he can't hold it no more
[1:02:23] it's been restored back
[1:02:25] full power full vindication amen i've
[1:02:28] been listening to the restoration of the
[1:02:30] bride tree
[1:02:30] he speaks about restoration and bringing
[1:02:33] back
[1:02:34] the claim the claim that can be enforced
[1:02:37] to bring anything back to his rightful
[1:02:39] owner
[1:02:39] where it belongs
[1:02:43] now the police today may not be able to
[1:02:44] do that but the holy ghost can
[1:02:49] somewhere it went from its rightful
[1:02:50] owner and can wander around anywhere
[1:02:52] he said but to restore is to bring it
[1:02:55] back to who it really owns to
[1:02:57] almost and to bring it back to its
[1:02:59] natural state
[1:03:00] where it was in the first time or the
[1:03:02] beginning bring it back to its natural
[1:03:05] condition
[1:03:06] in order this we have a right to enforce
[1:03:09] if there's a law
[1:03:10] to enforce this rightful condition or
[1:03:12] restoration to
[1:03:14] restore
[1:03:16] now we've been talking about the power
[1:03:18] now we're going to talk about the
[1:03:19] authority
[1:03:21] amen he said if somebody stole some
[1:03:22] property and they've been holding your
[1:03:24] property capital
[1:03:25] captive and you take the go to the law
[1:03:27] and you go to this personal law
[1:03:29] will force or should enforce this person
[1:03:31] to restore this property back
[1:03:34] to its natural owner to its first estate
[1:03:37] enforcement he said oh he said we have
[1:03:40] the privilege
[1:03:44] you're a privileged people because
[1:03:47] you're living in a time to be privileged
[1:03:49] to force and force upon satan the claims
[1:03:52] that god gave you
[1:03:56] we are living in a moment that the power
[1:03:59] of the holy ghost is in the church again
[1:04:01] in full demonstration in power not a
[1:04:04] portion not a part
[1:04:06] but all of it and full
[1:04:09] power has been restored back into
[1:04:12] individuals hearts again
[1:04:14] as it was on the day of pentecost
[1:04:18] hallelujah he said god has a law
[1:04:22] and his word is the law and god is in
[1:04:25] his word
[1:04:26] made certain claims of the church told
[1:04:28] him you could have certain things
[1:04:30] and we have a right to force
[1:04:33] upon satan our god-given rights
[1:04:36] and say give it back
[1:04:42] hallelujah amen we heard a prophecy here
[1:04:45] amen just a couple of months ago almost
[1:04:47] almost a year ago now
[1:04:48] at our labor day meetings but ron
[1:04:50] speaking on take it back

[1:04:55] by anxiety and fear

[1:05:01] every time she'd get go go somewhere
[1:05:02] just fall upon her to where she'd almost
[1:05:04] become motionless and trying to figure
[1:05:06] out what to do and the mama says we're
[1:05:08] taking her
[1:05:09] because we're going to get her delivered
[1:05:13] we're going to take her because god is
[1:05:14] going to meet her there
[1:05:16] and god's going to deliver her this
[1:05:18] thing
[1:05:19] and god ordained a whole service called
[1:05:22] her out by name
[1:05:27] and we don't think god don't know who we
[1:05:29] are
[1:05:31] we don't believe he knows about our
[1:05:33] everyday struggles and our mind battles
[1:05:34] we've been going through and the spirits
[1:05:36] have been haunting at us and things has
[1:05:37] been happening
[1:05:38] he knows all about it you know he knows
[1:05:41] and he cares not only does he knows
[1:05:42] about it he cares about it
[1:05:44] and he cared enough to amen invite a
[1:05:46] whole
[1:05:47] a 7-800 people whatever it was to come
[1:05:49] to a meeting
[1:05:51] and a service i know many were delivered
[1:05:53] in this service but it was pinpointed to
[1:05:55] one person

[1:06:05] abigail
[1:06:09] what was it a son of god robed in the
[1:06:12] robe of the holy ghost
[1:06:16] adopted son of god preaching the word
[1:06:20] in his day and god coming down and
[1:06:23] saying amen
[1:06:25] and you saw a little girl get delivered
[1:06:29] and delivered today

[1:06:37] when the voice was spoken authority went
[1:06:39] out there was a power that backed it up
[1:06:43] and it said yes satan you went far
[1:06:45] enough take your hands off of god's
[1:06:47] property

[1:07:42] satan
[1:07:43] to give listen this to give up
[1:07:47] what he has unrightfully and deceitfully
[1:07:50] taken from god oh my souls are men

[1:07:59] children sickness of the body he placed
[1:08:01] upon people
[1:08:02] god made them in his image to be like
[1:08:05] them and the church
[1:08:07] is given the rightful legal rights
[1:08:10] by the bible to take the holy spirit and
[1:08:13] enforce this upon them
[1:08:15] amen hallelujah
[1:08:18] hello somebody and he goes to tell a
[1:08:21] story

[1:08:47] wife closes in it
[1:08:49] they drove 1500 miles to be in service
[1:08:52] coming to the service
[1:08:54] before a poor fellow found himself
[1:08:56] without anything
[1:08:57] 700 something miles from his home didn't
[1:09:00] know what to do
[1:09:01] he turned it to the police
[1:09:07] they had a big racket in louisville when
[1:09:09] stealing cars and repainting them
[1:09:11] didn't have to have the title there to
[1:09:12] sell it so they'd make you a title in a
[1:09:15] few minutes
[1:09:16] any number you want to put on it so
[1:09:18] they're having a terrible time
[1:09:21] so we got down on our knees
[1:09:26] amen now jesus wouldn't have
[1:09:29] had to do that he was the word we're not
[1:09:31] the word the word of the lord came to
[1:09:33] the prophets we were
[1:09:34] they wasn't the word but the word came
[1:09:35] to them jesus is the word he didn't have
[1:09:37] to pray he was god
[1:09:39] but we are his servants his prophets his
[1:09:41] servants whom the word of the lord comes
[1:09:43] to
[1:09:43] and the prophet is vindicated by whether
[1:09:45] it's the word of the lord or not but
[1:09:46] what he says come to
[1:09:48] pass and then when we have scripture
[1:09:50] here that says whatever
[1:09:51] wherever two or more gathered in my name
[1:09:53] and if they agree i'll be in their midst
[1:09:56] if they will agree on touching any one
[1:09:58] certain thing and ask and don't doubt
[1:10:00] they shall have what they ask for
[1:10:02] it will be given to them there's
[1:10:06] the law this
[1:10:09] is not a man's law this is god's law
[1:10:13] the one that's here to enforce the law
[1:10:15] is not
[1:10:16] some man it's not some earthly
[1:10:19] government
[1:10:20] it's the holy spirit
[1:10:26] how about people he says some of them
[1:10:28] don't even believe in the holy spirit he
[1:10:29] said you're rejecting your own peace of
[1:10:31] mercy
[1:10:32] he said but we got on our knees about
[1:10:34] five of us brother fred saltom and many
[1:10:36] others there four or five men
[1:10:38] knelt down and i pleaded this case
[1:10:39] before god
[1:10:41] and i took the word of the promise and
[1:10:44] sent it forth
[1:10:45] and the great holy spirit as he took the
[1:10:48] word to serve the summons
[1:10:50] oh my goodness listen this spirit can go
[1:10:53] behind walls
[1:10:55] it don't have to have a door to be open
[1:10:57] and go through the door
[1:10:59] amen they don't have to have a warrant
[1:11:01] it can go all the way past
[1:11:02] all that stuff they don't need nothing
[1:11:04] dictated by the man's creeds or dogmas
[1:11:07] it ain't bound by those things any
[1:11:09] longer it's been loose from all those
[1:11:11] things
[1:11:12] it was bound for 2000 years but now it's
[1:11:14] been loosed
[1:11:15] therefore it can go where it wants to go
[1:11:17] it can set who it wants to be set free
[1:11:20] he can deliver who it wants to be set
[1:11:21] free he can restore who he wants to
[1:11:24] restore
[1:11:24] it's not bound by laws of the land or
[1:11:27] man's creeds or ideas or dogmas
[1:11:33] and he said the holy spirit fell into
[1:11:35] that car
[1:11:37] a thief not a christian a thief
[1:11:41] not even somebody may be raised right a
[1:11:43] thief

[1:11:54] spirit came upon him and began to
[1:11:55] condemn him
[1:11:56] he turned around about halfway he said i
[1:11:59] saw him come and park the car on a
[1:12:01] certain street over across the river
[1:12:02] i raised up and told the brethren thus
[1:12:04] saith the lord and when they started out
[1:12:06] they went down the road and they set the
[1:12:08] car they're half empty with gasoline
[1:12:11] he said just it's just enough to take
[1:12:13] him halfway to bowling green and bring
[1:12:15] him back
[1:12:15] these men are sitting here as a witness
[1:12:17] what was it enforcing
[1:12:20] give it back
[1:12:23] and god cared enough about a little car
[1:12:27] well don't you know if he cares about a
[1:12:29] car he cares about your body

[1:12:41] gave you he gave you your healing
[1:12:45] sister erica he gave you your healing
[1:12:47] that's nothing but the devil that's
[1:12:48] trying to put something on you
[1:12:50] but there is a body standing here on the
[1:12:52] earth that is enforcing the law of god
[1:12:54] and say give it back

[1:13:01] a spirit

[1:13:05] somebody here to witness that tonight
[1:13:07] there's a spirit here that's greater
[1:13:09] than cancer

[1:13:12] any sin there's a spirit
[1:13:14] that's greater than any lukewarmness
[1:13:16] there's a spirit

[1:18:24] gospel
[1:18:26] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:18:28] believe
[1:18:29] no uncertain sound there it's the gospel

[1:18:38] there was authority in their name in
[1:18:40] their in their walk there was authority
[1:18:42] that they had
[1:18:43] given to them by the name of jesus
[1:18:45] christ
[1:18:46] and then peter would come to the gate
[1:18:48] called beautiful he said i don't have
[1:18:50] silver and gold but such as i have
[1:18:52] give unto thee in the name of jesus
[1:18:54] christ
[1:18:55] get up and walk amen there was an
[1:18:58] authority given there
[1:18:59] he said the gospel said that's the tone
[1:19:02] that's the tone that's in the bell
[1:19:06] that's the tone of the bell when they're
[1:19:09] casting out
[1:19:10] devils hallelujah
[1:19:13] i love to hear that bell tone
[1:19:17] and a devil hit the floor lost his power
[1:19:21] he might have had power brother hell
[1:19:22] over you for years but there was a tone
[1:19:24] that sounded
[1:19:26] it was a bell boom what was the sound
[1:19:29] and devil
[1:19:29] you were about to lose you're about to
[1:19:32] lose a person
[1:19:33] you thought you had you tried to cover
[1:19:35] him up with this
[1:19:36] you tried to cover him up with that amen
[1:19:38] every one of us he tried to cover up
[1:19:40] but there was a tone in the bell
[1:19:45] the devil said i'm going to go out like
[1:19:47] i went out before and he put his own
[1:19:49] boxing gloves on
[1:19:50] and he went out but this time he wasn't
[1:19:52] meeting brother hell he wasn't meeting
[1:19:53] brother timothy he wouldn't meet none of
[1:19:55] you

[1:20:36] moved and watch it be flowed into the
[1:20:37] sea
[1:20:40] that's the tone of the bell
[1:20:43] there's a certain tone in that gospel
[1:20:47] you hear about bell tinkle and says
[1:20:49] there's no more altar call that's the
[1:20:50] wrong tone
[1:20:52] it says no more prayer lines wrong tone
[1:20:55] devils are laughing laughing at
[1:20:59] preachers
[1:21:00] won't give a sinner a chance to repent
[1:21:04] laughing at preachers won't give a
[1:21:06] person a chance to be delivered
[1:21:10] but i like a certain tone it's the tone
[1:21:14] of deliverance
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:18] i like to hear the gospel speak and
[1:21:20] demons start screaming
[1:21:24] hello i don't like them laughing i like
[1:21:26] them screaming
[1:21:29] i like them running i like them fleeing
[1:21:32] i like a gospel that's got power in it
[1:21:35] that'll go up into a mezzanine and grab
[1:21:36] a little girl and say today's your day
[1:21:38] of deliverance
[1:21:41] i like a gospel that's got enough holy
[1:21:43] ghost in it that'll fall upon a young
[1:21:44] mother in a
[1:21:45] in the mezzanine seeding and anoint her
[1:21:47] heart and she run around the building
[1:21:49] and deliver of the cancer
[1:21:50] i like that kind of tone if you don't
[1:21:52] like that tone this gospel ain't for you
[1:21:55] but i like that tone i like the tone of
[1:21:57] devils screaming
[1:21:59] they screaming brothers means how come
[1:22:01] they can't scream and iron me
[1:22:03] why are they comfortable sitting on our
[1:22:05] pews why are they comfortable living in
[1:22:07] hearts

[1:22:09] ananias and fire where sin is called out
[1:22:13] what demons scream and run for their
[1:22:15] lies because there's a bride
[1:22:17] standing upon her feet she's heard the
[1:22:19] sound of a trumpet
[1:22:21] and the sound is moving in her heart and
[1:22:23] it's lifting her up
[1:22:25] [Applause]

[1:23:06] time

[1:23:56] true baptism
[1:23:58] of the holy ghost and that scene it
