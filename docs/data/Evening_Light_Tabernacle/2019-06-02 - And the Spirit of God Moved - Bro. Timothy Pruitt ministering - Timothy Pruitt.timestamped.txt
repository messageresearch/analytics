[48:03] you be seated for a moment before we go
[48:05] to the Scriptures he meant I have a few
[48:08] things to say it's my first time - I
[48:11] believe to speak since I've been home
[48:14] anyway haven't had we had was gonna plan
[48:17] on doing a you know be dismissed we're
[48:22] planning on doing a report on our
[48:26] mission trip but decided to kind of
[48:28] break it up and do a little different so
[48:30] brother Craig I believe you talked about
[48:32] Japan and the things that had happened
[48:34] there and you know as we left here I
[48:37] told my wife I said I don't know if I've
[48:39] ever been overseas where I felt like I'd
[48:42] even I felt like I just come back I so
[48:46] wore out and exhausted from the camp and
[48:48] things and things that had happened
[48:50] there and the prayer lines and
[48:52] afterwards there after camp at brother
[48:54] David's and just and so my body was real
[48:58] wore down and actually got pretty sick
[49:00] on the way over there landed in Japan my
[49:02] ears was all stopped up and I was really
[49:05] having a rough time and I spoke the
[49:07] first service and after I got through
[49:09] brother Craig said you know what that's
[49:11] it for you you the kids and the
[49:15] Philippines needs you so we can we can
[49:17] handle it from here and and so I just
[49:19] was able to rest for a minute and get
[49:21] get on my feet because I had five
[49:22] services to preach there in the field
[49:25] Ping's to the young people and you can
[49:27] bring those up as we talk about this and
[49:30] so me and brother Tim winters left on
[49:32] Tuesday to head to the Philippines and
[49:35] and we got there Tuesday night and you
[49:38] talked about a cultural shock you leave
[49:41] you know Shreveport it's just a little
[49:43] small airport and and and you go to
[49:46] those places and there's just not just
[49:48] seemingly thousand it seems like
[49:50] millions of people swarming around you
[49:52] and you don't have cell phone service
[49:54] immediately when you land so you don't
[49:56] know where the brothers are to pick you
[49:57] up and you're looking around like a
[49:59] little lost lamb and trying to figure
[50:02] out your way and finally we got
[50:04] connected and then and this was we
[50:06] landed about 8:30 at night and nine
[50:09] o'clock something like that 9:30 about
[50:11] time we got out of the airport and we go
[50:13] right into rush hour and nine o'clock at
[50:15] night and I believe Philippines is
[50:22] English for traffic the most traffic I
[50:26] ever seen in my life
[50:27] and the Manila there and I just we took
[50:33] we went a couple of miles to the hotel
[50:35] but it took like an hour to have to get
[50:36] to the hotel and just through
[50:39] bumper-to-bumper look like a parking lot
[50:41] out on the highway and you know you'd
[50:43] have three or four lanes but they'd go
[50:45] six or seven cars wide and and you know
[50:48] just and then in between all the cars
[50:50] was motorcycles and everything we'll get
[50:52] some of those pictures in a minute but
[50:54] you know all through the all through
[50:57] that you know and then motorcycles going
[50:59] in and out and we're just looking at
[51:01] that and like man there's not a driver
[51:02] in the United States let a motorcycle do
[51:05] what they're doing
[51:05] it'd be a door opening up and slamming
[51:08] them or something I can't but that's
[51:09] just the way they operate
[51:10] and so you know they're moving on
[51:12] through and and then and then we get
[51:14] down the road a little bit in the middle
[51:16] of the road in the middle of all this
[51:17] chaos is a man standing in the middle of
[51:20] the road selling peanuts
[51:21] I mean he's willing to die for peanuts
[51:25] reminded me of that Wednesday night
[51:26] brother brother Tim mentioned that quote
[51:28] would rather read him said throw your
[51:30] worldly bag of peanuts down and get on
[51:32] the train that's what you're doing if
[51:34] you still got peanuts today you're
[51:35] standing in a bunch of traffic and
[51:37] you're gonna die
[51:38] there is a way out of it a man but
[51:40] anyway we got there and we got to the
[51:43] hotel spent the night got up the next
[51:45] morning went to the camp a couple hours
[51:47] away and we gathered here at this place
[51:49] it was a resort there which resort
[51:53] there's not what you think of a resort
[51:55] is not you know what we would have in
[51:58] the United States but it was a nice
[51:59] place and they've done everything they
[52:00] could to make us comfortable and enjoy
[52:03] ourself and we sure appreciate brother
[52:05] Danny del mundo and all the ministry
[52:08] there they're a model
[52:09] I mean it's um it's really amazing what
[52:11] they do and how they do it and work
[52:13] together and really appreciate their
[52:16] love for the Lord and their they want to
[52:18] do something for young people they
[52:20] normally have their camp on Easter
[52:22] weekend which is of course the same
[52:23] weekend as ours and he had asked me last
[52:26] year when he was here to come and I said
[52:28] well brother Danny I said I'm booked far
[52:30] as I know on Easter weekend into the
[52:32] rapture and so I can't give you a gave
[52:37] you a yes on that day so what I'll see
[52:38] what I can do so we waited till January
[52:41] he texted me and he said I'm sorry but I
[52:44] can't move it this year we'll have you
[52:45] next year in about five days later he
[52:47] said I can't help it you got to come
[52:49] this year we're going to move it and so
[52:51] we're gonna have it this such-and-such
[52:52] weekend can you come what am I supposed
[52:54] to say then so I say yes and so anyway
[53:00] we got there Wednesday night and they
[53:02] gather together and I'll tell you I
[53:04] haven't seen as much talent and love for
[53:07] the Lord and and just willingness to
[53:09] serve God in these young people it's a
[53:12] wonderful group it's a tribute to good
[53:14] ministry there in the Philippines so
[53:17] this is the one of the pictures here can
[53:19] go on and this is just during the day
[53:21] you sitting around you know they wanted
[53:23] us to visit so we'd sit around of course
[53:25] they found out really quickly but the
[53:28] Tim winters could sing and and you know
[53:30] they they came running from everywhere
[53:33] to listen to him saying so this is this
[53:35] a picture actually some of this mixed up
[53:37] because I wasn't able to get it all on
[53:39] the right order but this is actually on
[53:40] Sunday at brother Danny's church I
[53:43] preached at his church sunday and
[53:45] brother Tim's out afterward
[53:46] his church here they lived to the right
[53:49] and the bottom there and up those stairs
[53:51] into the back of his church got a real
[53:54] nice place there and this is where they
[53:57] this is their old church is just right
[53:59] behind where I've taken that previous
[54:01] picture and this is where they have
[54:03] their Sunday school for kids now they're
[54:05] at their church now this group here was
[54:09] amazing his brother Rolando and he's a
[54:13] wonderful man he's a wonderful musician
[54:15] and a minister their pastor and his
[54:18] family's great musicians just talented
[54:21] unbelievable talent to sing and play and
[54:24] by play anything just incredible I mean
[54:27] this boy would tear up the piano
[54:28] reminded me of that story brother
[54:30] Branham talked about the woman that got
[54:32] on the anointing said if there was four
[54:34] sets of keys should play all four of
[54:35] them he was that kind of guy and so
[54:37] brother Rolando began to play for
[54:39] brother Tim and and his son would play
[54:42] and man you talking about a Pentecostal
[54:43] Jubilee there was having a good time
[54:45] they love playing for brother Tim but
[54:47] anyway this group here if you see all
[54:49] them people there's about seventeen of
[54:51] them came in that van behind them yeah
[54:55] with their luggage and not only that
[54:58] they traveled for 33 hours in a that van
[55:02] with no AC and it's just as hot there as
[55:05] it is here but they just wanted to be
[55:08] there he said I I've come to this camp
[55:10] every year and it's worth every
[55:11] sacrifice I made he says see how God
[55:15] works in my young people and the change
[55:17] is brought in their life and he said I
[55:18] wouldn't miss it for anything in the
[55:20] world oh wow what a testimony and go
[55:23] ahead as to some of their journey flat
[55:25] tires you see the road they're traveling
[55:27] on there's the road they're traveling on
[55:28] it's not paved all the way I mean you
[55:31] sure they have some pavement there but
[55:32] there's a lot of a lot of dirt road and
[55:34] stuff ferries they have to call cross
[55:36] and he was just a wonderful wonderful
[55:39] man we really fell in love with him and
[55:41] his family there's still him there with
[55:44] the kids as they was on the ferry coming
[55:46] all over just excited to come to camp
[55:49] now this is Sunday all the all the young
[55:53] people and different ones they love
[55:54] pictures and so they got us all together
[55:56] as much as they could stash in that
[55:58] little spot and they crammed in there
[56:00] they get pictures you can see me and
[56:02] brother Tim and the blue right up here
[56:03] in the middle and and this was actually
[56:07] a group we had I don't remember I think
[56:09] about five different countries
[56:10] represented there this is a group of
[56:13] young people from Indonesia and it all
[56:16] started with brother Danny and brother
[56:18] Nestor and those going to the different
[56:20] places inviting the pastors to come into
[56:23] a mystery Expo and they begin to tell
[56:25] them about the mysteries of God and they
[56:27] go through all the mysteries and these
[56:29] people just start eating out of their
[56:31] hands because they've never heard how
[56:33] you know these the truths and these
[56:36] things in a Bible and then they then
[56:38] after they show them all that they show
[56:40] them to where it came from to the
[56:41] Prophet and their pastor actually spoke
[56:44] one of the morning services he came he
[56:47] came to the message was baptized gave
[56:49] his heart to the Lord and as far as I
[56:50] know just about his whole church came to
[56:52] the message and this is a group from
[56:55] Indonesia there they came and song this
[56:58] is some of the traffic this is these big
[57:00] old they call them jeepneys they're just
[57:02] extended Jeeps they make them out of
[57:04] various cars various parts decorated and
[57:08] it's kind of long along their owners
[57:10] taste I guess and it's a cheap way to
[57:13] travel and they use them to run up down
[57:14] the roads and there's thousands of them
[57:16] and they don't have good there's a man
[57:19] selling peanuts and water cigarettes
[57:22] whatever he's in the middle of the road
[57:23] selling him you just keep going that it
[57:28] okay well anyway we had a wonderful time
[57:31] I actually missed it I had of another
[57:33] picture there I thought I had it was
[57:34] actually at the end of that in that meet
[57:37] and we baptized 30 young people for the
[57:40] glory of God and we're just thankful for
[57:42] all that he's done is doing a man and
[57:45] just still getting testimonies and
[57:47] things of God working in their lives and
[57:49] their appreciation they'd really love
[57:52] the Lord they love God's people I guess
[57:55] their favorite song you'd hear them
[57:56] singing I love this family of God so
[57:59] closely knitted into one and and so
[58:02] anyway we really love them and
[58:03] appreciate them and thankful for the
[58:05] opportunity amen we thank you for your
[58:08] prayers and for all that you've done to
[58:10] support that and
[58:12] amen it wasn't in vain Amen God came on
[58:15] the scene let's stand together
[58:17] I tell you back in the back of just
[58:19] shouted cried danced just had myself a
[58:23] good old time back there he meant as I
[58:25] heard the worship and the singing I
[58:26] don't know if it felt that good back
[58:28] there I couldn't believe how good it
[58:30] felt in here amen and we just want to
[58:33] move into this as we have some things on
[58:36] a heart this morning Genesis chapter 1
[58:38] and verse 1 it says in the beginning God
[58:51] created the heaven and the earth and the
[58:54] earth was without form and void and
[58:56] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[58:59] and the Spirit of God moved upon the
[59:02] face of the waters and God said let
[59:04] there be light and there was light
[59:07] and God saw the light that it was good
[59:09] and God divided the light from darkness
[59:12] and God called the light day and the
[59:14] darkness he called night
[59:16] and the evening and the morning were the
[59:19] first day god bless you this morning's
[59:22] you seated I like to just take a thought
[59:32] this morning Lord gave it to me
[59:35] actually in preparation I'll be gone the
[59:37] into this month to brother John spinach
[59:40] and he gave it to me then but spoke a
[59:43] little bit on it open up at brother
[59:45] Nathan's and it felt to bring it this
[59:46] morning but out of the second verse and
[59:49] the Spirit of God moved and the Spirit
[59:52] of God moved you know looking upon this
[59:55] this fall without form and void I got to
[59:58] looking at that and so the words the
[1:00:00] meanings of the word means to be
[1:00:02] formless a lot of confusion unrealities
[1:00:05] emptiness nothingness empty space a
[1:00:09] place of chaos void means empty unfilled
[1:00:14] desolate or barren and there was a time
[1:00:18] when the world was laying in this
[1:00:20] condition as we read here it was without
[1:00:22] form it was without void it was all
[1:00:25] covered with water and was laying in the
[1:00:27] dark and a dismal gloomy atmosphere but
[1:00:31] that wasn't the final word a man that
[1:00:33] wasn't the final place that wasn't the
[1:00:35] final atmosphere a man but the scripture
[1:00:38] begins and it says it love how it speaks
[1:00:41] it says the voi it was without form and
[1:00:43] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:00:46] the wall of the deep and the Spirit of
[1:00:49] God began to move a man then the Spirit
[1:00:52] of God began to move the word was spoke
[1:00:54] and the dynamics was there to bring it
[1:00:57] to pass
[1:00:58] the Spirit of God proved it was greater
[1:01:00] than the darkness they covered the earth
[1:01:02] it proved it was greater than the void
[1:01:05] it proved it was greater than the
[1:01:06] nothingness that was there it was
[1:01:09] greater than the gloom it was greater
[1:01:10] than the coldness it was greater and
[1:01:12] light begin to dawn upon the earth no
[1:01:15] doubt the gloom and the darkness fault
[1:01:17] it tried to hold his position it tried
[1:01:19] to hold his place but the Spirit of God
[1:01:21] proved he was greater amen because today
[1:01:25] we have a son we have a moon amen the
[1:01:27] very creation the spoken word of
[1:01:29] Almighty God that said let there be
[1:01:31] light and it was so it's still hanging
[1:01:33] there today
[1:01:35] proving that the Holy Spirit is greater
[1:01:37] than gloom is greater than darkness is
[1:01:39] greater than void it's greater than
[1:01:41] emptiness is greater than all of that if
[1:01:44] you can get the Spirit of God moving
[1:01:46] there will be light that will shine amen
[1:01:48] they'll be bursts that take place
[1:01:50] there'll be a change in hearts there'll
[1:01:52] be a change in life when the Spirit of
[1:01:54] God begins to move a man he said here in
[1:01:57] the power of the devilish - tonight
[1:01:59] maybe a cancer has got us-- maybe
[1:02:02] something else has taken ahold of you
[1:02:04] some diseases even the disease of sin
[1:02:06] whatever it is it may look ever so dark
[1:02:09] and gloomy it to you now it may look
[1:02:12] like you'll never recover maybe it
[1:02:14] looked like you can't get over that TB
[1:02:16] or that prostate trouble or that lung
[1:02:18] trouble or that tumor or that
[1:02:20] condition the doctor may say that ever
[1:02:23] hope is gone but standing right by your
[1:02:25] side today ready to take you in
[1:02:28] possession stands the eyes of faith
[1:02:31] and the eyes of faces of victory through
[1:02:34] the Lord Jesus Christ he says away was
[1:02:36] Satan and his glue away was Satan in his
[1:02:40] gloom and up with the faith of the Lord
[1:02:42] Jesus Christ
[1:02:44] the faith of Almighty God faith can take
[1:02:47] his holy stand on the Rock of Ages and
[1:02:49] Pearson eagle-eyes to the stormy clouds
[1:02:52] in every ways of death and
[1:02:54] disappointments that's trying to wash
[1:02:56] away the foundation from here it'll
[1:02:58] stand there and look beyond it the skies
[1:03:01] and say God is right and this morning we
[1:03:05] can say God is right he said let there
[1:03:08] be light and that Sun is still hanging
[1:03:10] there that moon is still there you
[1:03:12] didn't get up this morning word and if
[1:03:13] the Sun was going to come up you knew by
[1:03:16] faith God spoke it it'll happen
[1:03:18] hallelujah and you can have that faith
[1:03:20] this morning you don't have to worry
[1:03:22] about it God said you're healed it's
[1:03:24] going to happen God said you're
[1:03:26] delivered it's called a happen and the
[1:03:28] Spirit of God begins to move and bring
[1:03:30] that word to pass the Spirit of God
[1:03:33] moves amen he says faith is the
[1:03:35] substance of things hoped for the
[1:03:37] evidence of things seen the very faith
[1:03:40] is that little wimp it's a will he said
[1:03:44] that little will that you have by you if
[1:03:47] you only let it take your possession
[1:03:49] tonight take you believe it and how
[1:03:51] faith in it and believe that God's Word
[1:03:54] is true you've accepted it then faith
[1:03:56] will work miracles for you but you need
[1:03:59] to take that whip and go to driving the
[1:04:00] devil off your property maybe we need
[1:04:04] some people anointed by the Spirit of
[1:04:06] God who can slip those Holy Ghost take
[1:04:09] their body take their mind take their
[1:04:11] soul take complete every fiber and go to
[1:04:14] whipping the devil out for the promises
[1:04:16] of God there will be a bride that will
[1:04:18] stand
[1:04:19] when all hell is washing away the
[1:04:21] foundations and pushing this and pushing
[1:04:23] that they'll stand regardless hey man
[1:04:28] there's something trying to work in
[1:04:30] every individual heart here today he
[1:04:33] says saying that's the truth but does it
[1:04:35] mean me he said it means whosoever will
[1:04:38] it means you and so the Spirit of God
[1:04:41] moved something that was for you say
[1:04:44] well sometimes I feel so empty well let
[1:04:46] the Spirit of God start moving sometimes
[1:04:49] I feel so depressed let the Spirit of
[1:04:51] God start moving I hadn't felt God he
[1:04:54] seems so far away let the Spirit of God
[1:04:56] start moving I'm not even talking about
[1:04:58] in this building I'm talking about and
[1:05:00] youth and small Amen we can have it in
[1:05:04] this building but most importantly we
[1:05:06] wanted in our hearts we want God
[1:05:08] changing lives and changing my heart and
[1:05:11] moving me up higher let him move in your
[1:05:15] heart let him move in your life let him
[1:05:17] move in your family let him move in your
[1:05:19] marriages let him move in the church let
[1:05:21] me move in the service let him move
[1:05:23] today and let the Spirit of God let him
[1:05:26] begin to flow like rain upon our lives
[1:05:31] the Spirit of God moved upon the water
[1:05:34] and said let there be light God had a
[1:05:37] reason for doing that Oh hallelujah
[1:05:41] God had a reason for doing that for down
[1:05:44] beneath that water were seeds he had
[1:05:46] planted down beneath all that gloom and
[1:05:49] that darkness and that void and that
[1:05:51] emptiness that was seeds lay in there
[1:05:53] and so he had a reason for saying let
[1:05:56] there be light and it had to be have
[1:06:00] sunlight to make it live and the first
[1:06:02] light that was ever given in the earth
[1:06:04] was God spoken word the first light that
[1:06:06] ever struck the earth was God spoken
[1:06:08] word he said let there be light and
[1:06:10] there was light
[1:06:11] that turned darkness into light in order
[1:06:14] to bring the creation of joy and life
[1:06:16] upon the earth then the Spirit of God
[1:06:18] has it move with love and compassion on
[1:06:21] that day the first day of the
[1:06:23] creation the Sun rose and swept across
[1:06:26] his rays begin to dry up the water and
[1:06:28] made an atmosphere above and for the
[1:06:30] first time it was to bring joy and life
[1:06:33] to the earth that was a great hour but
[1:06:37] he says the world was without form and
[1:06:39] void and darkness was upon the earth
[1:06:42] nothing but complete chaos but when the
[1:06:45] world was in that condition the Spirit
[1:06:47] of God began to move on the face of the
[1:06:49] water and the entire picture was changed
[1:06:52] it was changed from total chaos to a
[1:06:55] garden of heat I've seen lives that have
[1:07:00] been changed from chaos a man that was
[1:07:03] empty and void and without car but the
[1:07:06] Spirit of God began to move it might
[1:07:08] have been in your room might have been
[1:07:09] in your car it might have been in the
[1:07:11] dark places of your life in the darkest
[1:07:13] moments with the Spirit of God begin to
[1:07:15] move and it turns you from chaos into a
[1:07:19] Garden of Eden a man is transforming
[1:07:25] power of God that'll take something
[1:07:27] that's nothing and make something
[1:07:28] wonderful out of it
[1:07:29] I was nothing they meant God
[1:07:31] transforming power it takes some moving
[1:07:33] of the Spirit to bring the seeds to life
[1:07:37] hey man that's why we can't stand by for
[1:07:40] some cold dead formal doctrine amen but
[1:07:44] we must have the movie of the Spirit in
[1:07:47] our church hey man is not not just in
[1:07:50] church but in everyday life you know
[1:07:54] it's possible and this is what I'm
[1:07:56] saying this for you because we can have
[1:07:57] it moving in this building but it's
[1:07:58] possible you can be sitting here every
[1:08:01] one of us has got the same senses and
[1:08:03] you can have such a headache that you
[1:08:05] can't hardly stand it and I wouldn't
[1:08:07] have no headache how do I know about
[1:08:08] your headache it's something dealing
[1:08:10] individual with you and he says that's
[1:08:12] how the Spirit of God can come into a
[1:08:14] group of people and can baptize that
[1:08:17] person in such a way that the power of
[1:08:19] God cares them to where they don't even
[1:08:21] know where their hat anymore and the
[1:08:23] next person sitting by
[1:08:24] them don't know nothing about it hey man
[1:08:28] so it's not just about Oh God moving my
[1:08:30] church moving me moving this earth
[1:08:35] moving my life amen we use it as a
[1:08:38] cop-out more we had a good service but
[1:08:40] did the service happen in your pew then
[1:08:43] it happened in your scene did it happen
[1:08:45] in your life did it change you that's
[1:08:47] what we're interested in Amy we want him
[1:08:50] to move us I don't want to ever get in
[1:08:53] that condition that the Spirit of God
[1:08:54] can fall in the building and I don't
[1:08:56] know nothing about it sir
[1:09:00] I want to be knowing what God is doing I
[1:09:02] want to be cognitive his presence he
[1:09:05] comes every service but sometimes we get
[1:09:07] bias before he realize he was here and
[1:09:12] we use the words was a great service
[1:09:14] truly it was for somebody this is a
[1:09:19] great service is not just a bunch of
[1:09:22] clapping and a Manning and great
[1:09:24] services when you came to the building
[1:09:26] and you left different that's a great
[1:09:29] service
[1:09:30] hey man and that's what we want forever
[1:09:32] individual you know it's not as we're
[1:09:35] not going in this all together yes we
[1:09:37] will be raptured all together but it is
[1:09:39] an individual walk hey man hey man he
[1:09:48] said the doctor said to me not long ago
[1:09:50] Billy you think them Pentecostal people
[1:09:53] just get excited hissing no sir I don't
[1:09:55] he said well what makes them that
[1:09:57] nervousness but they begin to have and
[1:09:59] causes them to scream and holler and go
[1:10:01] on I said doctor you mean to tell me
[1:10:03] that the nerves can be excited without
[1:10:06] something to excite them something has
[1:10:10] to excite them something so what's there
[1:10:14] I said it's an unseen force of the Holy
[1:10:17] Ghost moving among us it excites that
[1:10:20] born-again spirit hallelujah it excites
[1:10:25] that born-again spirit it brings us
[1:10:28] excitement to that spirit the power of
[1:10:30] God begins to come down faith comes by
[1:10:33] here and the Holy Ghost takes the word
[1:10:35] and
[1:10:36] it out over the people to catch it with
[1:10:38] the power that regenerated born-again
[1:10:41] life something has to cry out hey man he
[1:10:45] said god help today when they come to an
[1:10:48] adopted theology when we come to an
[1:10:51] adopted theology instead of the baptism
[1:10:54] of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:55] he said God helped the day when we come
[1:10:59] to a head knowledge or an intellectual
[1:11:01] understanding instead of the baptism of
[1:11:04] the Holy Spirit because of the Spirit of
[1:11:07] God didn't begin to move and begin the
[1:11:09] world within Earth seeds wouldn't have
[1:11:11] popped out of the ground it began to
[1:11:13] create an atmosphere where seeds could
[1:11:15] come to life amen the word could be
[1:11:18] spoke but the spirit had to follow the
[1:11:20] word and bring it to pass when we'll get
[1:11:25] there in a minute
[1:11:28] he said God helped the day when we've
[1:11:30] come and adopted theology instead of the
[1:11:33] baptism of the Holy Spirit God helped
[1:11:36] the day when he took away tithers from
[1:11:37] the church and balled up some old tough
[1:11:39] rooster and sold it for fifty cents of
[1:11:41] plate to get money to pay the preacher
[1:11:43] god help the day when we substituted the
[1:11:46] upper room and made it a supper room God
[1:11:48] helped the day what we need today is a
[1:11:50] good old fashioned st. Paul revival in
[1:11:53] the Bible Holy Ghost preached back again
[1:11:56] in his power and simplicity he man he
[1:12:03] goes on the store and I love this story
[1:12:05] because the truth is still true today he
[1:12:07] said I was way up in Canada I was riding
[1:12:09] one night been waiting back about 40 or
[1:12:12] 50 miles thousands of miles from a
[1:12:13] hardtop road last fall back hunting I
[1:12:16] was riding out through the moonlight
[1:12:18] come to this little barn over place big
[1:12:21] ole bunch of big tall stately pines the
[1:12:24] moon was shining on looked like a
[1:12:26] graveyard a spooky looking place and he
[1:12:28] said all of a sudden the wind came down
[1:12:30] and the wind began to hit them and they
[1:12:33] go more just a mournful sound I've heard
[1:12:36] it I've been there myself up on Mount
[1:12:38] Lemmon I stood and looked a little bit
[1:12:40] and thought of this scripture right here
[1:12:42] yes sir talking about Joel's prophecy
[1:12:44] amen I will restore say the Lord these
[1:12:46] trees
[1:12:47] me in mind of some of those great big
[1:12:49] fine churches standing there but just as
[1:12:52] dead as a doornail he said even the
[1:12:55] pummel worms eat all the bark off of him
[1:12:57] and everything else I heard his preacher
[1:12:59] other day say that pretty good
[1:13:01] he said if you ain't careful you sisters
[1:13:02] at Palma warm eat your bark off you get
[1:13:06] it later
[1:13:07] he said I see it's been at work eating
[1:13:09] your bark off a man these trees put them
[1:13:13] onto some of those great big fine spark
[1:13:16] churches just as dead as the door now
[1:13:18] the fiery trials has blazed all the
[1:13:20] spirit away from it and there's nothing
[1:13:22] left but a big statue but just as dead
[1:13:25] as it can be and he said when the
[1:13:27] rushing mighty wind comes from heaven
[1:13:29] the only thing they can do is groan and
[1:13:32] carry on and sailing so I hardly know
[1:13:34] anything that's right
[1:13:36] they say days of miracles are past just
[1:13:38] every time God sends a revival and signs
[1:13:41] and wonders begin to come up and fall
[1:13:42] around the people they say well ah
[1:13:44] that's all right everybody else does it
[1:13:46] too and everybody else has these
[1:13:48] feelings too and everybody has this
[1:13:49] everybody got blah blah blah and it just
[1:13:51] go on and they begin to actually mark
[1:13:53] the moving of the real Holy Spirit of
[1:13:55] God is that what the palmer worm left
[1:13:59] the caterpillar even what the Methodists
[1:14:01] left the batma seen what the Baptist's
[1:14:03] left the Pierce Presbyterian ate what
[1:14:05] the Prince of material left the pentacle
[1:14:07] dog it's so a man we've just set the
[1:14:09] Scottsville camp and that man that had
[1:14:11] been raised in that Church of the
[1:14:13] Nazarenes he said we come to our
[1:14:15] services that we used to have services
[1:14:17] like this he said we don't have them no
[1:14:20] more why because the worm got in the
[1:14:22] church theologies and man-made ideas
[1:14:26] begin to eat away amen all that's moving
[1:14:28] of the Spirit and begin to turn it into
[1:14:30] a bunch of pluralism and now that same
[1:14:34] worm is against the message of the hour
[1:14:36] it's still the same word but he said I
[1:14:39] will restore
[1:14:41] hey man that will be a people who is
[1:14:44] open to the moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:46] that will be a people in the spirit of
[1:14:48] God moves they move with him hey man he
[1:14:56] says what is it
[1:14:57] there until they strip the church down
[1:14:59] till they got them setting just as dead
[1:15:01] as a doornail no spirit no shouting they
[1:15:05] said well we don't need that no more
[1:15:06] brother Brent apparently thought so no
[1:15:08] shouting no joy no peace no healing no
[1:15:11] nothing what the Methodists left the
[1:15:13] Baptist see what the Baptist left the
[1:15:15] cattle parading or some other Church
[1:15:17] this one eat that and that he took away
[1:15:19] this and it took away that haven't got
[1:15:21] nothing but a bunch of church creed you
[1:15:23] know that's the truth what one left the
[1:15:25] other eight until you got nothing but a
[1:15:27] big dead tree and he said every time God
[1:15:32] sends a big rush of glory down they
[1:15:35] would just sit there and moans they I
[1:15:36] don't believe it it's psychology we
[1:15:39] don't need altar calls no more we don't
[1:15:42] need a prayer line no more we don't need
[1:15:44] that no more that's just a bunch of
[1:15:45] worked up emotion somebody's got a hold
[1:15:48] of our humble workers got a hold of
[1:15:50] somebody hey man when Joel looked at
[1:15:56] that insulted gods but he said God said
[1:15:59] I will restore says the Lord if that
[1:16:02] wasn't in there I wouldn't know how to
[1:16:04] preach that's what a prophet of God said
[1:16:08] he said if that wasn't in there I would
[1:16:10] know how to preach it but I will restore
[1:16:13] saith the Lord
[1:16:14] it happened to look right night there
[1:16:16] the wind began to blow how those still
[1:16:19] fanned starching dead as it was sitting
[1:16:21] moaning and groaning didn't have no life
[1:16:23] to bend no bark on it to make it
[1:16:25] flexible
[1:16:26] we're just moaning and groaning with the
[1:16:28] account of the wind my doctor so-and-so
[1:16:30] said this and there's no mercy here and
[1:16:33] there's no more blood here and there's
[1:16:34] no more intercessor somebody's got a
[1:16:36] pommel worm in the church amen I
[1:16:39] happened to notice down underneath there
[1:16:41] was some undergrowth coming up some
[1:16:44] other bushes about like that they had
[1:16:46] life in them and when the wind began to
[1:16:48] hit them they began twisting and
[1:16:50] shouting and giving glory to Carl let me
[1:16:53] tell you brother God's going to raise up
[1:16:55] a generation God's gonna raise up a
[1:16:59] generation of people out of all this
[1:17:02] dead stop I will restore hey man green
[1:17:14] leaves clapping their hands having a
[1:17:16] wonderful time what a frolic it was but
[1:17:19] that big old tree standing there moaning

[1:17:32] way what was grown and embolden others

[1:17:52] same we're making one grow what's giving
[1:17:55] the other a good time it happy to think
[1:18:02] what was this doing doing every time
[1:18:04] that little tree would twist what would
[1:18:06] it do it pull the roots he would loosen
[1:18:08] up the ground so he could go deeper and
[1:18:10] get a better hold every time God sends
[1:18:13] his blessing upon a born-again mana one
[1:18:15] man a woman
[1:18:16] it'll only loosen up the roots so they
[1:18:18] can go deeper higher better free

[1:20:19] experience with all he had tried it on
[1:20:22] his own and killed one Egyptian but in
[1:20:24] the power of God and the Spirit of God
[1:20:26] he went down there and he loosed every
[1:20:28] slave
[1:20:28] and he said every captive free and he
[1:20:31] destroyed Pharaoh's army why because he
[1:20:33] got into the spirit of god hey man you
[1:20:39] see Samson out there minding his own
[1:20:41] business in the cage bunch of
[1:20:43] Philistines surrounded thousands of them

[1:21:01] little while maybe I quip some of you
[1:21:02] Philistines he's not not that only team
[1:21:05] laying close to him was a job Oliver
[1:21:07] knew and he picked it up and the Spirit
[1:21:10] of God came on him and he killed a whole
[1:21:12] group of listings all he's waiting for
[1:21:14] you to do is pick up the promise of God
[1:21:17] and the Spirit of God will fall on you
[1:21:19] and you'll whup that devil you gonna
[1:21:24] dance it on top of him to you stomp a
[1:21:26] mudhole in him hallelujah he's I think
[1:21:30] about Shamgar during the time of to my
[1:21:33] mind is liberal joking preachers party
[1:21:35] done a fine job he ran up there in
[1:21:37] Indiana as I think I'll Shamgar than the
[1:21:40] time of judges over in Israel
[1:21:42] Amen here he was his family was done it
[1:21:45] was getting worse and worse they come
[1:21:47] here after year and stole their crops
[1:21:49] and here he raised up another crop and
[1:21:51] all of a sudden here's trunk trunk trunk
[1:21:53] what was it it was coming back to
[1:21:55] critisize to take back to say it wasn't
[1:21:57] real to say you don't have nothing what

[1:22:02] Shamgar had enough of it and when they
[1:22:05] grabbed an ox goes the Spirit of God
[1:22:06] began to fall on him he's not how do you
[1:22:09] know because the Spirit of God would
[1:22:11] have to be a one man to work 500 and it
[1:22:16] would have to take the spirit of God and
[1:22:18] it was the same spirit back in the world
[1:22:20] over the earth and it brought out of the
[1:22:22] seeds and it brought out the trees and
[1:22:24] the birds and animals and the people it
[1:22:29] was the same spirit that fell on Shamgar
[1:22:32] it was the same spirit of fennel David
[1:22:37] when he said who is that an
[1:22:39] uncircumcised for listening to challenge
[1:22:41] the armies of the Living God David only
[1:22:45] needed hearing one time because why he'd

[1:30:25] video
[1:30:26] he's I was talking to a man not long ago
[1:30:28] they didn't believe in music in the
[1:30:30] church he was holding the fuss with me
[1:30:32] about it he said oh the music belongs to
[1:30:34] the world I said the Spirit of God
[1:30:38] didn't come on that stood up profit
[1:30:40] until he got a minster out and begin to
[1:30:43] play a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost
[1:30:45] song you know what he's talking about
[1:30:48] he said the Spirit of God came down on
[1:30:50] the Prophet that's right God doesn't
[1:30:53] change and if God liked music and that
[1:30:55] day he likes music today he began to
[1:31:01] play a song I don't know what they
[1:31:03] played in them days but I like to
[1:31:04] imagine a good old song life there's
[1:31:06] going to be a meeting in the air in that
[1:31:08] sweet sweet Bible that kills a lot of
[1:31:11] Church of Christ message believers and
[1:31:12] sweet by-and-by God's own son will be
[1:31:15] the leading one and they're all behind
[1:31:17] because he's already coming we can't
[1:31:19] sing that song no he's coming
[1:31:21] I can sing that song still yet today
[1:31:24] because he is going to appear and I'm
[1:31:27] going to be changed to be just like him
[1:31:29] [Applause]
[1:31:33] something like that some of those good
[1:31:35] old-fashioned Holy Ghost songs and the
[1:31:38] Spirit of God came on the Prophet he
[1:31:41] said I tell you brother when we get all
[1:31:42] the formal shackles shook off and the
[1:31:45] Spirit of God in the songs again wow
[1:31:50] and I thought his word word word work in
[1:31:52] the songs again and get back to the
[1:31:55] whole place what we can have the Spirit
[1:31:58] of God moving in the place then the
[1:32:00] Prophet can see a vision then the powers
[1:32:02] of God can come into the church then
[1:32:04] they'll see divine healing then they'll
[1:32:06] see the resurrection of Christ then
[1:32:08] they'll see he's the same yesterday
[1:32:10] today and forever come on I'm about to
[1:32:14] choke you now
[1:32:15] he said well you say 'la brother Brando

[1:32:35] you can't be the Prophet be part of the
[1:32:38] minstrels do something to bring the
[1:32:41] Spirit of the Lord down I wanna be one
[1:32:47] is guilty I'm bringing the Spirit of God
[1:32:50] down I don't want to be guilty of
[1:32:52] bringing a critical spirit in the church
[1:32:54] bringing my bitterness
[1:32:56] turn to my unbelief in the church I want
[1:32:59] to be guilty and I was warned they drop
[1:33:01] the Spirit of God down you say well

[1:33:26] to have the minstrel to help it yeah you
[1:33:29] know my Bible I didn't see that it was a
[1:33:30] tape player anyway

[1:33:33] harmony with God the Prophet begins to
[1:33:36] see things now brother if you don't see
[1:33:38] divine healing you don't see the baptism
[1:33:41] of the Holy Ghost you don't see the
[1:33:43] mighty move of the Spirit of God moving

[1:43:26] Oh will you just get somebody just to
[1:43:28] start having a little movement and start
[1:43:32] moving a little bit it's time bending a
[1:43:34] little bit in the spirit God can take

[1:43:44] her seat with her boy a man because I
[1:43:46] saw astounding and I'm on the front row

[1:44:22] [Applause]
[1:44:29] that's what happened when the Spirit of
[1:44:31] God Luke he calls that which is dead
[1:44:33] back to life again
[1:44:35] it calls life to the body to a place
[1:44:38] that was void and empty but the spirit
[1:44:41] begins to murder and it changes the
[1:44:43] whole landscape man brother Joe got
[1:44:48] drunk that night he only gonna lie to

[1:45:12] building she went giving praise and
[1:45:15] glory to hope God mighty God getting the
[1:45:17] service Saturday night when brother
[1:45:19] Aaron was preaching a woman that was
[1:45:21] sitting about the second row grabbed all
[1:45:22] her diabetic medicines
[1:45:24] and chucked it up on the altar she said
[1:45:27] I had my Shamgar moment she said I'm
[1:45:30] done with this saying hey then she was

[1:45:34] said but she said told her one of the
[1:45:35] things that you want to pick that up I
[1:45:37] ain't picking it up you take it throw it
[1:45:39] in the trash hallelujah that's what
[1:45:44] happened when the Spirit of God begins
[1:45:45] to move hallelujah when the spirit moves
[1:45:49] the sin loses its hope when the spirit
[1:45:51] moves changed fall off when the spirit
[1:45:54] moves grave loses his power when the
[1:45:57] Spirit of God is free to move lives are
[1:46:00] changed home to transform lives were
[1:46:03] filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:46:07] I love it so if I shout with no one
[1:46:09] shouted it's from a heart that's been
[1:46:12] clean when I run from I when I run but
[1:46:14] no one else is running it's running from
[1:46:16] a soul that's been retained there's no
[1:46:19] telling what we're gonna do the Spirit
[1:46:21] of God begins to move in this building
[1:46:24] hallelujah would it be somebody say Lord
[1:46:27] stop with man
[1:46:29] let it move in my heart let it move in
[1:46:32] my family I'm just going rejoice for me
[1:46:44] Lord Almighty God when the Spirit of God
[1:46:48] begins to move lines are changed
[1:46:59] he said when the Holy Spirit begins to
[1:47:02] move and give discernment that's what
[1:47:04] brings the presence of God among the
[1:47:06] people just like singing a hymn wow I
[1:47:12] just caught that we listened yeah I
[1:47:17] listen tapes yeah many takes hundreds of
[1:47:20] tapes one of my favorite parts I have to
[1:47:25] admit is in every one of them I mean I
[1:47:28] love the word of course but something
[1:47:30] special is a vindication for our day and
[1:47:33] discernment starts to taking place just
[1:47:37] this week the past week we got to walk
[1:47:41] down the same places brother Branham
[1:47:42] walked in mill town called Georgia
[1:47:46] Carter's house I remember when I was
[1:47:48] open buddy Craig me and brother Joe was
[1:47:49] preaching brother Craig's Labor Day
[1:47:51] meetings I preached on Georgia Carter's
[1:47:53] just part of my sermon because a lady
[1:47:55] sit in the audience she came up to me at
[1:47:58] the end that service she said you know
[1:48:00] that's amazing he said I was actually
[1:48:01] her caretaker in her later years so I
[1:48:04] got a picture of her we like to census
[1:48:05] absolutely she opened up her album her
[1:48:08] sitting buyer and looked at it oh wow
[1:48:11] and I looked a little deeper in that
[1:48:13] photo behind Georgia Carter was this
[1:48:15] little plaque sitting on her wall
[1:48:16] hanging on the wall it said I believe in
[1:48:19] the power of a living God
[1:48:23] trying to talk that one out of it when
[1:48:31] the Holy Spirit begins to move and give
[1:48:34] discernment that brings the presence of
[1:48:37] God among the people just like to
[1:48:40] singing a hymn shouting a message given
[1:48:44] in unknown tongues and it goes to critic
[1:48:48] he went out the door now it brings the
[1:48:50] Spirit of God among the people he said
[1:48:53] you heard your pastor preach many times
[1:48:54] on the word unto the spirit got among
[1:48:56] the people they just screamed out they
[1:48:58] couldn't hold their peace no longer why
[1:49:00] because the Spirit of God moved he said
[1:49:03] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:49:05] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:49:06] mouth of God
[1:49:07] the Spirit of God takes the Word of God
[1:49:09] to the congregation and feeds them so
[1:49:12] they can grow spiritually on that word
[1:49:15] it takes the Spirit of God moving amen
[1:49:19] to take the word to the people because
[1:49:21] if it ain't the Spirit of God it's man's
[1:49:23] intellectual abilities it takes the
[1:49:29] Spirit of God that's the thing that
[1:49:31] delivers the word the word goes right
[1:49:33] out the Holy Spirit follows that word
[1:49:35] wherever the words preach you'll see
[1:49:37] your pastor preach it first thing you
[1:49:39] know across the building goes a Holy
[1:49:43] Ghost that's right it's the conductor of
[1:49:45] the word amen the word so rather than
[1:49:48] word is the conductor of the Spirit
[1:49:50] because where the word is preached the
[1:49:51] spirit follows it wherever he goes why
[1:49:54] the spirit follows the word
[1:49:56] he said oh I like that he said I like
[1:49:58] sound Bible teaching and the Bible Holy
[1:50:01] Ghost coming back confirming Bible
[1:50:03] teacher hey that's what I like but I
[1:50:08] don't need no lectures I don't need no
[1:50:11] man's abilities to put this quote and
[1:50:13] splice this quote together
[1:50:14] I want the Spirit of God moving if the
[1:50:18] Holy Ghost don't conform it confirm it
[1:50:21] you're got your wires crossed
[1:50:26] ain't saying this to embarrass anybody
[1:50:28] but these speakers didn't remember how
[1:50:30] many problems we have with these
[1:50:31] speakers come in here you sit over there
[1:50:34] sound be great next day you sit there
[1:50:36] and it's bad over here just kept jumping
[1:50:39] around poor brothers pulling their hair
[1:50:40] out finally we got the master to come
[1:50:44] the engineer who engineered him he'd
[1:50:48] come walking in here guys off the plane
[1:50:49] walked in here he walked down that
[1:50:51] outlet to the top walk back down walk
[1:50:53] back up he said you got your wires
[1:50:54] crossed it took a master ten minutes and
[1:51:00] a screwdriver and then we got the sound
[1:51:04] we got today the one who engineered it
[1:51:08] the one who made the parts and put it
[1:51:11] all together and said he knew it would
[1:51:13] work he came and he proved it but at
[1:51:16] what was wrong it was two wires that was
[1:51:18] crossed a mental nice fail most speakers
[1:51:20] is positive negative positive negative
[1:51:22] something like that but on those bows
[1:51:23] they do things different is be negative
[1:51:25] positive positive negative or something
[1:51:27] like that so the last two or first two
[1:51:29] one of the other were crossed but it
[1:51:31] only took was ten minutes with the
[1:51:34] master who designed it preachers can put
[1:51:43] a sermon together they can put it this
[1:51:45] quote in that scripture and do this and
[1:51:47] do that but ten minutes or less with
[1:51:49] that master and one little tool of the
[1:51:51] Holy Spirit in his hand he can rewrite
[1:51:54] you why are you two what are you a sound
[1:51:56] out of living God with the same size the
[1:51:59] same power the same only goat Jesus
[1:52:01] Christ the same yesterday today you will
[1:52:04] hear the power of the resurrection by in
[1:52:07] the Church of here
[1:52:08] [Applause]
[1:52:12] the problem is we got too many people
[1:52:14] that's crossed the wires they tried to
[1:52:18] do the best they could they try not many
[1:52:22] of them ain't doing it out of malice or
[1:52:24] maybe hatred I don't know some of them a
[1:52:26] I don't know but this is how Paul felt
[1:52:30] first Corinthians 2 and verse 4 he said
[1:52:32] my speech and my preaching was not with
[1:52:35] enticing words of man's wisdom but in
[1:52:39] demonstration of the Spirit and a power
[1:52:42] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:52:45] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[1:52:50] that's the kind of preaching I like to
[1:52:52] hear
[1:52:53] brother Brian would say this he said
[1:52:55] today with great intellectual messages
[1:52:57] we can explain it to you can see the
[1:52:59] picture he said but that isn't what
[1:53:03] we're looking for we're looking we're
[1:53:05] not looking for the mechanics we're
[1:53:07] looking for the dynamics we got the
[1:53:13] mechanics of religions of the Bible soap
[1:53:15] bottle eyes it takes like a great 35
[1:53:18] coach train sitting out there on the
[1:53:20] track but you ain't got a lick of steam
[1:53:22] in it to make it go down the tracks it
[1:53:24] takes the dynamics to prove to perform
[1:53:27] with the monkey mechanics and what we
[1:53:29] need now is to see that this is what
[1:53:33] we've been taught all these years this
[1:53:35] is the truth or not it's been explained
[1:53:37] over and over and over through different
[1:53:41] seminaries and churches and message
[1:53:43] churches that's me and master churches
[1:53:46] and so forth until we're looking but now
[1:53:49] we're looking to see who this person is
[1:53:52] now you say brother Branham how would
[1:53:55] you do it
[1:53:56] God is here Jesus Christ the same
[1:53:58] yesterday today and forever is here his
[1:54:01] powers just the same in whatever ones he
[1:54:03] does not fail he cannot fail he is the
[1:54:07] Donna Mae
[1:54:09] here's God he has remained God serves we
[1:54:13] would see Jesus that's what I want to
[1:54:18] see in the service I don't want to just
[1:54:21] see a bunch of mechanics and this lying
[1:54:23] down with that if I don't see Jesus you
[1:54:25] wasted my time but if I can see Jesus
[1:54:28] and I can see him in the revealed word
[1:54:31] of this day look when he was crucified
[1:54:38] the old critic some drunken Roman
[1:54:40] soldiers come out there put a rag on his
[1:54:43] face hit him on the heads and now for
[1:54:45] your profit prophesy and tell who here
[1:54:47] to hit you he didn't clown for a devil
[1:54:49] he never opened his mouth and said a
[1:54:51] word course he knew they had passed the
[1:54:53] stick to another one said you tell us
[1:54:55] who hit you now we'll believe you see
[1:54:56] that's the critics they don't believe it
[1:54:59] but he was a prophet but he didn't clown
[1:55:01] for nobody
[1:55:01] he said well last night we had so much
[1:55:04] of the mechanics and not the dynamics he
[1:55:06] said now my body is the mechanics but my
[1:55:08] body will not operate without the
[1:55:10] dynamics the spirit operates my body
[1:55:13] brings it in control he said like an
[1:55:15] automobile with no gasoline in it no
[1:55:18] firing power no matter how fine the
[1:55:20] dynamics and the mechanics is fixed up
[1:55:22] the cylinders and the points and the
[1:55:24] plugs and whatever more and this may
[1:55:26] have a current also you get you got the
[1:55:28] hell you can have all those things he
[1:55:29] said but that's the way God is you've
[1:55:31] got to get a believer with God to make
[1:55:34] contact then something's going to happen
[1:55:37] our educational systems our
[1:55:39] denominational system has took the place
[1:55:42] of the Holy Spirit leading in the church
[1:55:44] he's on our grapevine training of
[1:55:47] Ministers and things of taking the place
[1:55:49] of all-night prayer meetings an old-time
[1:55:51] way we used to get with God instead of
[1:55:54] having preachers we got lectures men
[1:55:58] knows the word just as well they can sit
[1:56:01] there and put it together in such a way
[1:56:02] that it astounding how they do it they
[1:56:05] know the mechanics but they ain't got
[1:56:07] the dynamics he said we want the
[1:56:09] dynamics I don't care about the
[1:56:12] mechanics I want to know the dining
[1:56:15] [Applause]
[1:56:17] boy rock this fluid hit an intellectual
[1:56:20] demon right in the head he said I don't
[1:56:24] care about the mechanics I will to know
[1:56:27] the dynamics he said what good does it
[1:56:30] do he said I don't know how the car runs
[1:56:33] out there it's got Pistons and cylinders
[1:56:35] I don't know how to much pressure issues
[1:56:37] only thing I know is the dynamics put
[1:56:40] the key in there and turn it put it in
[1:56:42] the gear and drive that's what we know
[1:56:44] God made the promises I'll pour out my
[1:56:47] spirit upon all flesh your sons and
[1:56:49] daughters shall prophesy how is he gonna
[1:56:51] do it I can't tell you I just want to
[1:56:54] know the dynamics of God's system that's
[1:56:57] the main thing today
[1:57:06] listen Estate Minh or will fallen apart
[1:57:08] he said today we've studied the
[1:57:11] mechanics until it's all mechanical
[1:57:17] worship is mechanical responding to the
[1:57:21] words mechanical there's mechanical
[1:57:23] devices on pulpits now put that one in
[1:57:32] your pipe and smoke it
[1:57:36] it's all mechanical what good is an
[1:57:42] automobile without something in it to
[1:57:43] drive it what good is the lights or the
[1:57:49] fixtures if there's no current running
[1:57:51] through it what good is all the
[1:57:53] mechanics we've got schools educators so
[1:57:55] forth that can train a man till he can
[1:57:57] stand in the pulpit with such manners
[1:57:59] till he's an eloquent person and still
[1:58:02] don't bring the power of God where is
[1:58:05] the power
[1:58:05] that used to be in the church listen
[1:58:09] what he calls it where is the
[1:58:11] Pentecostal blessing that used to flow
[1:58:14] through the churches he said that's the
[1:58:16] reason our world has fallen apart
[1:58:18] because we got away from the real
[1:58:20] principles of God what's the real
[1:58:24] principle God get the Spirit of God
[1:58:26] in the turns let the wind blow again
[1:58:31] listen it wasn't Peter standing up on
[1:58:34] the day of a book of Acts and he began
[1:58:35] to lecture the group until he had enough
[1:58:38] smarts to go out there and begin to
[1:58:39] spread the gospel no it wasn't Peter at
[1:58:41] all Peter needed that same wind amen he
[1:58:45] said this ain't it boys just hold on he
[1:58:47] made a promise the venison was awesome I
[1:58:51] got it no you ain't got it yet hang on a
[1:58:53] little bit it's coming in about that
[1:58:56] time they got all in one mind and one
[1:58:58] Accord and the Holy Spirit blew through
[1:59:00] the place and lots of the lights of fire
[1:59:03] come upon their lives what started this
[1:59:07] whole thought was me I'll watch the
[1:59:09] little video the other day science is
[1:59:11] putting out now that actually when an
[1:59:13] egg of a female is germinated by the
[1:59:16] male it actually gives forth a burst of
[1:59:19] light they're catching it on video now
[1:59:22] and they're watching it and all of a
[1:59:25] sudden let there be light
[1:59:33] I can remember me you when you was in
[1:59:37] that dark place away from God so lost
[1:59:42] and undone void emptiness you talking
[1:59:45] about a real emptiness how many has
[1:59:46] experienced that emptiness and all of a
[1:59:50] sudden the Spirit of God began to move a
[1:59:54] man I don't see him right now but
[1:59:56] brother Justin was sitting there playing
[1:59:57] her drums it began to move over his bed
[1:59:59] one night what was it all of a sudden a
[2:00:03] hit and the light let there be light
[2:00:10] there was a wired spoke about our
[2:00:12] brother Justin there was a wired spoke
[2:00:13] about me there was a word spoke about
[2:00:15] brother Joe and Billy Craig but there
[2:00:17] and all of you let's receive the life of
[2:00:19] God it said let there be light and there
[2:00:23] wasn't no darkness it was going to hold
[2:00:25] that life back and wouldn't no void or
[2:00:27] emptyness or depression of spirits of
[2:00:29] hell they could put itself around and
[2:00:31] try to guard it and keep it from
[2:00:32] happening that spirit came through
[2:00:35] anyhow hallelujah don't you know the
[2:00:38] devil trying to block that book of Acts
[2:00:40] try to block it from happiness but the
[2:00:42] word was spoken tarry in Jerusalem until
[2:00:45] you receive power on high let there be
[2:00:48] light Polson and that light is still
[2:00:56] burning today same as the Sun millions
[2:01:02] or whatever years ago let there be in
[2:01:04] life and in 2019 six thousand years past
[2:01:10] the beginning of time it's still hanging
[2:01:14] there it's still there it's raining
[2:01:18] outside
[2:01:19] sounds like clouds must be out there
[2:01:21] it's still there it's still shining
[2:01:26] today is just as good as it is on a
[2:01:28] bright cloudless day it's still there
[2:01:30] because his word said it would be in
[2:01:33] that light broke forth on the day of
[2:01:36] Pentecost let there be light
[2:01:40] 2,000 years later it's still here that
[2:01:46] light's still burning just the same as
[2:01:49] it burned in Peter burning Paul it's
[2:01:51] back to another book of Acts again it's
[2:01:54] back to the same power the same
[2:01:56] resurrection the same life it'll bring
[2:01:58] old withered hand just like it did and
[2:02:00] bring it back to life again and
[2:02:03] play with his fingers and just smile and
[2:02:08] he who started the work he's going to
[2:02:10] finish the work hallelujah it's still
[2:02:17] burning he says in the hour let me go by
[2:02:30] he said where where is that Pentecostal
[2:02:32] blessing that used to flow through the
[2:02:33] churches that's the reason our world has
[2:02:36] fallen apart because we got away from
[2:02:38] the real principles of God the educated
[2:02:41] men got educated men into systems and
[2:02:44] things it does that's what got us into
[2:02:46] the condition we are today that's the
[2:02:48] reason our world has fallen apart
[2:02:50] another place in the terminal Ida said
[2:02:53] this and this our brother when we wonder
[2:02:55] what's the matter with our revival
[2:02:56] what's the matter we got the material we
[2:02:59] got everything we got the mechanics but
[2:03:01] where's the dynamics that's what we need
[2:03:03] to move Jesus Christ on the scene what's
[2:03:05] the matter he's not tell you there is
[2:03:07] one here today hallelujah
[2:03:09] called the Holy Ghost that can touch you
[2:03:12] off with the dynamics he is the dynamics
[2:03:15] of the mechanics we stand today us
[2:03:17] Pentecostals one of the greatest
[2:03:19] churches in the nation thousand times
[2:03:21] thousands added each year but where is
[2:03:23] the Holy Ghost we've accepted it by
[2:03:25] speaking in tongues we've seen how it's
[2:03:27] acting I listen to this Methodists
[2:03:30] accepted it by shouting Luther accepted
[2:03:32] it by faith
[2:03:33] sound like we got more Lutheran's in the
[2:03:35] message again today and so forth like
[2:03:38] that that isn't it well you just
[2:03:43] received the word by a preach well thank
[2:03:48] the Holy Ghost there I'm not receiving
[2:03:49] nothing but intellectual ideas and what
[2:03:53] you conjured up and your studying has
[2:03:55] made you mad to make you think the life
[2:03:58] is coming from you life comes from him
[2:04:05] if he ain't in it it's nothing but
[2:04:08] man-made Creed's if lives ain't being
[2:04:13] changed people say we're having amazing
[2:04:16] services but we don't need off the cost
[2:04:18] yet sitting out there they got
[2:04:19] pornography demons and act like they
[2:04:22] don't they're like people whistling in
[2:04:24] the graveyard skeletons in the closet
[2:04:27] well we got such a perfect Church
[2:04:29] because I'm preaching who fold you know
[2:04:33] we need the Holy Ghost movie don't ever
[2:04:37] settle for an intellectual sermon no sir
[2:04:42] I don't want ever be in the service
[2:04:44] that's just intellectuals and just this
[2:04:46] and that some man's Creed I want to see
[2:04:48] the Spirit of God moving and not just
[2:04:50] over there right here amen
[2:04:54] he said we stand today said Luther
[2:04:56] accepted by faith so forth like that
[2:04:58] that isn't it it's the word it's the
[2:05:01] word turned on hello it's the word
[2:05:06] turned on the light turns on the
[2:05:08] mechanics and they become the dynamics
[2:05:10] they are the Dannette dynamics when the
[2:05:13] dynamics comes to the mechanics it
[2:05:15] starts the thing rolling take the word
[2:05:17] if there's one thing missed up it won't
[2:05:19] start lay aside every weight every hism
[2:05:22] every Creed that the dynamics the Holy
[2:05:24] Spirit can flow through the word and
[2:05:26] vindicate the word that's promised of
[2:05:28] this day then the great Church of God
[2:05:30] will rise to her feet like a
[2:05:32] jet-propelled plane and take off the
[2:05:34] skies to meet her master that's exactly
[2:05:37] right
[2:05:37] until we do that it won't work that's
[2:05:43] what's about will who will do it who
[2:05:45] will keep it in this day what we're
[2:05:47] talking about remember remember remember
[2:05:50] it must be the dynamic
[2:06:00] he says there's churches churches Brides
[2:06:03] brought you've heard this quote and he's
[2:06:05] been quoted in churches bride Brides but
[2:06:07] there's got to come one I will restore
[2:06:10] sayeth the Lord there has to come a real
[2:06:14] bride it has to come one that's not only
[2:06:17] got the mechanics but the dynamics in it
[2:06:22] makes that church live moving the power
[2:06:25] of his resurrection until we come to
[2:06:27] that place until we find that place what
[2:06:30] good does it do to polish the hubs we've
[2:06:35] got this clean looking car on the
[2:06:37] outside it's all polished but inside is
[2:06:39] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[2:06:41] bird we've allowed pornography we've
[2:06:46] allowed spirits of hell and our churches
[2:06:48] in our lives and it ain't the church
[2:06:51] fault if the words being preached and
[2:06:54] the spirit God made it to church fall
[2:06:57] it's daddy's fault it's Mama's fault his
[2:07:03] children's fault it ain't the word it
[2:07:10] ain't somebody else in the churches
[2:07:11] fault
[2:07:12] it's you and you alone but we can polish
[2:07:18] the hubs
[2:07:19] we can make it look all clean and shiny
[2:07:23] sing just certain songs what good does
[2:07:27] it do to give her a facelift when
[2:07:29] there's no dynamics in it no matter how
[2:07:32] much the mechanics proved to be right
[2:07:34] there's got to be dynamic to make it
[2:07:36] work but I can promise you if the
[2:07:38] mechanics ain't right that dynamics
[2:07:40] ain't gonna make it work that's what he
[2:07:44] proved that's what Easter proved he
[2:07:46] wasn't the only the word he was God
[2:07:48] himself the dynamics in the word that
[2:07:51] made the body of Jesus cold stiff dead
[2:07:53] in the grave shake to life again and
[2:07:55] rise again and roll away the stone I am
[2:07:58] he that was dead so dead to the son said
[2:08:01] he was dead the moon said he was dead
[2:08:03] the star said it all nature said he was
[2:08:05] dead and
[2:08:06] the whole world has to recognize he's
[2:08:09] alive again he was not only the
[2:08:11] mechanics he was also the dynamics
[2:08:16] hallelujah and as he being the groom the
[2:08:19] bride has come forth
[2:08:20] comes causes part of him and he can only
[2:08:23] be the manifestation of the fulfilling
[2:08:25] of all revelations from all all the
[2:08:28] others who spoke of the bride he can
[2:08:29] only manifest if it does something
[2:08:31] different from the groom it isn't the
[2:08:34] bride because she's flesh of his flesh
[2:08:37] bone of his bone life of his life power
[2:08:40] of his power
[2:08:42] she is him until the church becomes both
[2:08:48] dynamics and mechanics the Spirit of God
[2:08:50] that moved him to do the same things he
[2:08:52] did if he hit on all 16 cylinders so of
[2:08:55] the bride he said if he that believeth
[2:08:58] on me the works that I do shall he do
[2:09:00] also I give him a charge of my than that
[2:09:02] dynamics and it to his mechanics that
[2:09:05] the world will not be able to withstand
[2:09:06] it and I'll raise him up again at the
[2:09:09] last day that's a message Easter message
[2:09:12] the dynamics and the mechanics being one
[2:09:15] together the mechanics without the
[2:09:18] dynamics is no good neither is the
[2:09:20] dynamics without the mechanics you can
[2:09:26] scream and shout you can jump up and
[2:09:28] down you can do what you want to but
[2:09:29] deny the word it won't do no good
[2:09:31] you're just cranking the pistons got a
[2:09:33] little spark in there to fire but no
[2:09:35] gasoline to fire by it's only work as
[2:09:37] they come together so one will sit still
[2:09:39] and the other and go up that's the only
[2:09:42] thing there is yet both make it look
[2:09:44] alike both claim to be churches both
[2:09:46] claim to be bride but one has mechanics
[2:09:49] and dynamics it proves this brings the
[2:09:52] past of what he said the truth it won't
[2:09:54] it just won't move no matter how good
[2:09:56] the mechanics is until the dynamics come
[2:09:59] and when the dynamics come the fires may
[2:10:01] connect contact with an octane the
[2:10:03] gasoline and when that explodes it
[2:10:06] caused a combustion whew
[2:10:08] because I like to break forth it moves
[2:10:11] every motion every move for he is the
[2:10:13] same yesterday today and forever that
[2:10:15] resurrection that's a real power of God
[2:10:18] mechanics with the deny dynamics the
[2:10:21] spirit that quickens the spark that
[2:10:24] fires it's not the guests at fires it's
[2:10:27] the spark that fires a gas you can do
[2:10:32] nothing without me but with me you can
[2:10:33] do all things hallelujah here's the word
[2:10:37] it is the father living father sent me
[2:10:40] so send I you as a father has fired me
[2:10:43] woo as a father has he said as the
[2:10:46] father has fired me and pushed me into
[2:10:49] everything I only do that which is
[2:10:51] pleasing to God now as he sent me so
[2:10:53] send I you with the same mechanics and
[2:10:56] the same dynamics operator and these
[2:10:59] signs shall follow them that claim to
[2:11:00] have the did not dine at the mechanics
[2:11:02] and the dynamics will take place Paul
[2:11:05] said the gospel came not to us in word
[2:11:07] only not just gasoline but in spark also
[2:11:16] to make him move there you are it came
[2:11:19] to us in the manner it's the same spirit
[2:11:21] that raised him up that quick and
[2:11:24] empower the Holy Ghost to fall on a dead
[2:11:26] body in the grave who and there wasn't
[2:11:30] enough stone there to hold him in and
[2:11:32] there wasn't enough of the governor seal
[2:11:34] around it to keep it there when that
[2:11:37] word was to break forth I can imagine an
[2:11:40] old dark cold tomb all Sinemet let there
[2:11:46] be light
[2:11:46] in a body they've been laying there
[2:11:48] three days stood back he didn't have to
[2:11:54] worry about the stone it was a power for
[2:11:56] the stone hallelujah the Bible says
[2:12:01] there was angels they rolled that stone
[2:12:03] away and they sat down on it they were
[2:12:08] showing the thing that held you there
[2:12:10] greater than it
[2:12:15] when that word is Quicken at the
[2:12:17] pre-designated moment that time is to be
[2:12:21] quicken that word in your life then
[2:12:23] enough Devils to keep it from happening
[2:12:25] that's what gives me hope to keep
[2:12:27] preaching I can see people said dad on a
[2:12:29] Pew for years but I know maybe today's
[2:12:32] the moment maybe this is a time all of a
[2:12:36] sudden they'll hear a voice say let
[2:12:37] there be light and all of a sudden the
[2:12:42] Spirit of God moves and stones beginning
[2:12:44] to roll out of the way those old chains
[2:12:47] that held and begin to fall off and the
[2:12:49] spirits begin to move back and they can
[2:12:51] walk out of that old grave amen a brand
[2:12:54] new creature move out of there well I
[2:12:57] love that song listening to it only if
[2:12:58] you can feel like what I'm feeling say a
[2:13:00] man if your new creations saying man if
[2:13:04] you're born by the power of God say a
[2:13:06] man if he's still the same today as he
[2:13:09] was yesterday saying man if he was one
[2:13:11] of those that was dead in the grave and
[2:13:13] lost in sin but the Spirit of God began
[2:13:15] to rule over here and begin to pull upon
[2:13:17] you awesome that came for say man if
[2:13:22] he's here today and he's filled you with
[2:13:23] the Holy Ghost there ought to be
[2:13:25] something on the inside a man if there's
[2:13:28] something that God has done for you if
[2:13:30] he's healed your body you ought to say a
[2:13:32] man if he's touched your life you're
[2:13:35] honest a man if he's brought your lost
[2:13:37] loved ones back I would be screaming
[2:13:39] amen amen
[2:13:41] [Applause]
[2:13:45] is there somebody here with voice to
[2:13:47] praise your God to give him glory to
[2:13:50] give him honor to say Amen I say yes
[2:13:54] Lord I say yes Lord let your spirit move
[2:13:57] on me Jesus let me be the one this
[2:13:59] morning that it breaks the pole I'll be
[2:14:02] changed I'll be moved into another place
[2:14:04] into another dimension to give God free
[2:14:07] oh let's just stand to our feet everyone
[2:14:10] and just lift your hands to heaven come
[2:14:16] on young trees well yeah it's the same
[2:14:19] win let the wind of God move for you

[2:14:32] there were lost and the Spirit of God
[2:14:35] begin to move hallelujah Oh
[2:14:40] can you say Amen hallelujah is that what
[2:14:45] I doctor said it ain't gonna do no good
[2:14:46] and the Spirit of God begin to move amen
[2:14:50] another night in that prayer line by the

[2:15:34] Spirit of God Spirit of God moved
[2:15:37] winblo change our lives move us into
[2:15:40] high heights deeper depths I want the
[2:15:45] dynamics this morning sure I love the
[2:15:50] word but the word is no good unless the
[2:15:52] Spirit in knowing the letter killeth but
[2:15:55] the Spirit bring his life he's here for

[2:16:59] [Music]
