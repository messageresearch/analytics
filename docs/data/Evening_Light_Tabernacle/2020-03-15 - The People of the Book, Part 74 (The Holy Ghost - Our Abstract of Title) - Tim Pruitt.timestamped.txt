[10:34] we want to go before the Lord in prayer
[10:36] this morning we're gonna remember the
[10:39] shut-ins different ones in the nursing
[10:41] home those that can't be here this
[10:43] morning when I continued a member
[10:46] brother Ron he's really battling
[10:48] weakness in his body trying to recover
[10:51] from the surgery all this going on amen
[10:55] my prayer has been that the Angels that
[10:58] ministered unto Elijah when he was in
[11:00] his moment of being down and weak
[11:03] remember the venom said that God called
[11:05] the angel with the Tinder's hands and
[11:08] said he they put spiritual vitamins and
[11:11] his food and I believe we served that
[11:13] kind of God he would he'd go on to say
[11:15] he said the same God who loved Elijah
[11:17] loves you a man and I believe that this
[11:20] morning so was asking the Lord to move
[11:23] in that situation also brother Donnie
[11:25] got sick last night while ministering it
[11:28] would had to be taken to the hospital
[11:30] they done all kind of tests so far
[11:32] haven't figured out an issue and so we
[11:35] want to remember him this morning it
[11:38] just looks like Satan's putting out his
[11:39] challenge but I believe there's a people
[11:42] here to accept the challenge a God here
[11:45] to accept the challenge a God and the
[11:47] people amen so when I remember these
[11:50] needs also when I remember brother Matt
[11:52] Dexter he's having bleeding with in his
[11:55] left I can hardly see out of it ask him
[11:59] for prayer this morning also sister
[12:02] Alicia Brown is from Missouri is asking
[12:06] for our church to pray for salvation of
[12:08] her husband Isaac and restoration of
[12:11] their marriage also sister sandy James
[12:14] is home having some issues sick this
[12:17] morning been battling on and off for a
[12:19] few months and also asked for prayer for
[12:21] a family friend who's in the hospital in
[12:24] serious condition sandy Barbour also a
[12:27] member Liz butts this morning she's
[12:30] having us she's sick at home also
[12:32] brother little Jackson ogres be sick
[12:35] this morning is way
[12:37] so how many one have a need you want to
[12:39] make it known to the Lord today amen
[12:42] it's just biting together as believers
[12:44] that's what believers do is believe and
[12:47] we believe this morning we believe
[12:49] enough to ask and we ask and believe we
[12:52] shall receive and so we want to come
[12:55] together and believe in today that what
[12:58] we asked we shall receive Amen also you
[13:01] know even our president today is you
[13:04] know it should today to be a National
[13:06] Day of Prayer people are turning to
[13:08] prayer and just you know all the chaos
[13:11] is going on what's going to be like when
[13:13] the bride leaves here we're seeing a
[13:15] glimpse of it
[13:16] people running over people over toilet
[13:18] paper and crazy stuff and it's just
[13:21] going to get worse and worse as things
[13:23] progress in the as far as a tribulation
[13:26] would come on into the world so I don't
[13:29] plan on being here amen I believe that
[13:33] there's a bride there's a people on this
[13:35] earth that's going to leave this place
[13:36] and then Satan will have his way but
[13:39] until then we'll ask God to move in
[13:41] situations you know I was talking to the
[13:43] Lord last night I said I said you know
[13:46] you see what's going on the climate it's
[13:49] in the world I said I don't know how
[13:50] many soldiers left to save but this is
[13:53] really hindering us as far as getting
[13:55] out we've already had meetings canceling
[13:57] the youth camp and the Philippines has
[14:00] been cancelled
[14:01] there's overseas you know it's locked
[14:04] down and things but I said God you got a
[14:06] way to reach that last one and if it is
[14:10] stopped the plague and so we continue
[14:12] the work however it is we just want to
[14:14] have faith that you know the what's
[14:16] going on and you know how to handle
[14:18] these things and so let's just go to him
[14:21] in prayer amen that God had just moved
[14:23] in the situation's around us amen the
[14:27] blood of Jesus would just cover amen the
[14:29] the needs of these that we've read today

[47:58] little bit at least a couple of verses
[48:00] of it is well with my soul but as you as

[48:11] she sang that some time ago and then but
[48:17] no did she write that yes she did write
[48:19] that okay was the songs then from her
[48:22] heart it just shows what an anchor we
[48:24] have in times of trouble and then we
[48:28] have an anchor that no matter what's
[48:30] going on and it's going home time it may
[48:33] be trouble in the land but it's going
[48:36] home time and then we got to realize
[48:39] that we in this time it's important to
[48:42] make your calling and election sure a
[48:44] man be stable be steady be steadfast in
[48:49] the truth and the faith during this time

[49:07] mercy and His mercy I reach out for your
[49:11] need this morning because he's a
[49:13] merciful God who cares mm but I thought
[49:16] my goodness what a wonderful Pentecost

[49:21] Pentecostals can sing and worship our
[49:24] Lord Jesus man and declare His goodness

[49:30] God's unchanging hand no matter what the
[49:33] trouble is

[56:52] may God bless you as you are seated
[56:55] we're gonna be speaking today on the
[56:58] Holy Ghost our abstract of title and I
[57:04] have but just a few comments to make
[57:07] before that we go into the message some
[57:11] things that the Lord has dealt with me
[57:14] and of course some things also that are
[57:15] happening transpiring
[57:17] in our nation in the world as we speak I
[57:20] just got a text from brother sergei
[57:28] volkov in moscow russia and he he sent
[57:33] me some pictures of photographs of the
[57:36] stores in the United States where the
[57:38] shelves are bare and and of course a lot
[57:43] of you probably know of the hysteria
[57:44] that's going on in the United States now
[57:48] and and not only that but different
[57:50] parts of the world even our governor
[57:53] John bel Edwards signed the proclamation
[57:55] this week among other actions that halts
[58:00] the gatherings of more than 250 people
[58:03] until April the 15th or the 13th is he
[58:08] closed to all the public schools
[58:10] statewide effective Monday March the
[58:12] 16th resuming on Monday April the 13th
[58:16] as Louisiana seeks to slow the spread of
[58:18] the cove at 19 in the state as midday
[58:22] Friday or as of today really Louisiana
[58:26] has 77 positive cases with one death
[58:30] already a lot of people and are asking
[58:34] us about the Louisiana youth camp which
[58:37] is planned April 12th weekend starting
[58:41] on Thursday through Sunday and as of
[58:45] today is still planned the Dry Creek
[58:48] Campground officials have asked us to
[58:52] wait until tomorrow to make a decision
[58:54] until they can find out get a handle on
[58:56] the situation a little bit better
[58:59] and of course you know there's a little
[59:02] bit of concern as as there's talk about
[59:05] stopping state to state travel so we
[59:09] don't know what is all is going on I I
[59:11] just wanted to say a few words about it
[59:14] this morning because some already avant
[59:18] made this out to be the squeeze and you
[59:21] know to close our churches or cancel a
[59:25] meeting would be like giving in to the
[59:28] council of churches well this is not a
[59:30] squeeze on religious this bands
[59:33] government meetings and political
[59:35] rallies and ball games and sporting
[59:37] events and all kinds of events and they
[59:43] they all they've also said they won't be
[59:46] coming around in to our churches
[59:48] counting and making sure we don't have
[59:50] over 250 so you know don't don't worry
[59:53] about coming and gathering with us you
[59:55] won't be arrested we've got a police
[59:58] over here he's not here to arrest us
[1:00:00] he's here to enjoy the service but um
[1:00:03] this is not the persecution nor is it
[1:00:06] the tribulation plagues some are saying
[1:00:10] well we got to have persecution for
[1:00:12] there to be rapture and faith and
[1:00:14] because of the lack of that the rapture
[1:00:16] the body changes not imminent well
[1:00:19] that's not true you see this message is
[1:00:23] rapture and faith and if perfection
[1:00:26] would come by persecution than to church
[1:00:28] and the Dark Ages would have been
[1:00:29] raptured but persecution doesn't perfect
[1:00:34] with the church the blood of Jesus does
[1:00:36] and of course we should use precautions
[1:00:39] and certainly respect one another
[1:00:41] there are many whose immune systems are
[1:00:44] weak or compromised and I'm just gonna
[1:00:47] leave it up to your discretion as to
[1:00:48] whether you want to come to church or
[1:00:50] stream that's all up to you we're not
[1:00:54] canceling church but I do encourage you
[1:00:58] if you're sick don't expose it to others
[1:01:00] so some churches are even encouraging
[1:01:04] that they're people not shake hands at
[1:01:05] this time and there again I'll a leave
[1:01:08] that to your discretion as far as food
[1:01:10] shortages it's always wise to have a
[1:01:13] Orsola supplies on hand that's true
[1:01:16] whether it's tornado city it sees them
[1:01:18] snow season or whatever you know there's
[1:01:21] we know there's been a run on meet and
[1:01:24] shortages of toilet paper you figure
[1:01:27] that one out and him sanitizers because
[1:01:30] of hoarding it's fear that causes this
[1:01:32] and and I just want to go ahead and say
[1:01:37] I'm definitely not infinite and
[1:01:40] all-knowing but I'll tell you what is
[1:01:42] clear to me what is clear to me is the
[1:01:45] rapture has not happened and we may be
[1:01:48] in processes I bet they're not certainly
[1:01:50] believe in the shout and the voice and
[1:01:51] the different aspects of it but the
[1:01:53] consummation has not happened and so the
[1:01:58] tribulation is not own and the plagues
[1:02:01] are not falling and this is not the
[1:02:06] squeeze and the squeeze that the people
[1:02:10] or I've looked for it happens in the
[1:02:12] tribulation I just tell you I'm coming
[1:02:15] up this week I woke suddenly in the
[1:02:19] night must have been about 3:00 in the
[1:02:22] morning I didn't really look at the time
[1:02:24] but I'm with jugs I hadn't been asleep
[1:02:26] for a little while and I woke up wide
[1:02:28] awake and I was laying there thinking
[1:02:32] and going over my mind about thee about
[1:02:37] the seven trumpets and I was just kind
[1:02:41] of going and rehearsing them in my mind
[1:02:44] is it's kind of unusual you know you
[1:02:46] just wake up and that's your what you're
[1:02:48] thinking about and few nights later I
[1:02:54] had a dream where that I was asked to
[1:02:57] speak on the trumpets look like some new
[1:03:00] believers there or something and I I I
[1:03:04] so they were asking me would I speak
[1:03:06] about the trumpets and I just you know
[1:03:11] in my dream I just said well all I know
[1:03:13] about them is that they are for Israel
[1:03:16] and not for the Bride of Christ and so I
[1:03:19] went and reviewed and studied again the
[1:03:21] Feast of the trumpets just to go over
[1:03:25] them again
[1:03:26] and I just want to tell you brother
[1:03:28] branham makes it clear in the feast of
[1:03:31] the trumpet that the bride receives her
[1:03:33] squeeze in an ecclesiastical manner
[1:03:37] while it is Israel who receives it in a
[1:03:41] physical manner so the church will go
[1:03:45] through that time of tribulation but not
[1:03:48] the bride's you will be raptured before
[1:03:50] that time and the ecclesiastical squeeze
[1:03:53] that we are facing is um you know it's
[1:03:58] just it is band the anointing is band
[1:04:01] all the gifts of the Spirit is band even
[1:04:04] speaking in tongues which is the least
[1:04:08] of the gifts band divine healing and
[1:04:10] prayer lines and altar calls and worship
[1:04:13] a man and that's the virus we need to be
[1:04:18] concerned about and then people are
[1:04:23] concerning and panicking about the groan
[1:04:25] of hours but spiritual death is going to
[1:04:27] the land and most are unconcerned about
[1:04:29] it and throughout history let me tell
[1:04:33] you there have been downturns in the
[1:04:35] economy there's been hard times however
[1:04:38] I'm just - for those of you that are
[1:04:41] worried about hard times and difficult
[1:04:45] times let me remind you this last age is
[1:04:49] has been spoken of in the scripture to
[1:04:52] be rich and increased with Goods and
[1:04:54] have need of nothing so the last days is
[1:04:58] characterized as Noah's day of eating
[1:05:02] and drinking marriage and given in
[1:05:04] marriage and life you are known as usual
[1:05:06] and it is also characterized as it were
[1:05:10] in the days of Sodom that life is going
[1:05:13] on as usual until the climate he strikes
[1:05:16] and which would be the destruction the
[1:05:20] fire falling in the fact here in church
[1:05:23] age brother Branham talks about our
[1:05:26] burden that we face and this will be our
[1:05:28] burden I want you to just to remember
[1:05:31] what our real burden is what we're going
[1:05:34] to be faced with what what we what is
[1:05:37] the greatest threat
[1:05:38] in our day for this age and he says in
[1:05:44] the theater in churches he quotes the
[1:05:47] scripture I'll put no upon you none
[1:05:49] other burden the word for burden is
[1:05:52] weight or pressure the pressure of the
[1:05:55] Dark Ages was either bend or be broken
[1:05:58] bow or die
[1:06:01] it was the Inquisition the power of the
[1:06:03] Empire backing up satanic worship be
[1:06:06] organized or pay with your life each age
[1:06:10] had its pressures for example a great
[1:06:14] burden of the last age is the pressure
[1:06:17] of riches soft living and nervous
[1:06:22] tensions in a complex age that we seem
[1:06:25] unfitted to live in before they seems to
[1:06:28] have a clear-cut burden it was to defy
[1:06:31] Rome and stand up for the word even to
[1:06:33] death but again our age the pressure
[1:06:36] this age is richest self living and
[1:06:41] nervous tensions in a complex age that
[1:06:44] we seem unfitted to live in so I want
[1:06:47] you to realize this is where our
[1:06:49] greatest danger comes from and and of
[1:06:53] course it is the lukewarmness of this
[1:06:55] age that tries to come into every life
[1:06:58] into every home every person every
[1:07:01] church and and there but there
[1:07:05] historically there have has always been
[1:07:08] and always will be persecutions most
[1:07:12] fiercely and physically against the
[1:07:15] bride the elect of God historically this
[1:07:18] is true and it will continue to be true
[1:07:21] but a wholesale persecution we're not
[1:07:24] looking for that see those ideas which
[1:07:27] brother branham said the Pentecostals
[1:07:29] were looking for where the church is
[1:07:32] persecuted for its perfection and in
[1:07:35] response does great signs and wonders
[1:07:37] happens in the tribulation under Moses
[1:07:41] and Elijah the two witnesses it is to
[1:07:43] Israel but if you'll follow closely and
[1:07:46] see the junction there was a major
[1:07:49] corner a turning of a corner and brought
[1:07:51] balance ministry and this in his
[1:07:56] understanding in his revelation and
[1:08:00] disjunction happens at the when he
[1:08:03] preaches the Feast of the trumpets and
[1:08:05] he was to preach the seven trumpets
[1:08:09] going to take seven different services
[1:08:11] and try to preach them and he couldn't
[1:08:14] get the facilities and so on and on and
[1:08:16] and he went back to prayer and it was
[1:08:19] revealed to him that the trumpets are
[1:08:21] for Israel and not for the bride so from
[1:08:25] their own brother branham sees the bride
[1:08:27] receiving her persecution in a an
[1:08:31] ecclesiastical manner in other words a
[1:08:34] persecution that comes against the Word
[1:08:37] of God and and while the Jews their
[1:08:42] counterpart our counterpart receives the
[1:08:46] in a physical manner so before this
[1:08:50] important division the distinction is
[1:08:53] made brother Branham makes many
[1:08:55] statements about an coming persecution
[1:08:58] and our squeeze and so on like that but
[1:09:01] you know he was like Joshua was before
[1:09:05] the borders of Israel were defined and
[1:09:08] you know but then God God defines the
[1:09:12] borders and he says now let he saw have
[1:09:14] their portion mohab have theirs and let
[1:09:17] the and then he defines Israel's borders
[1:09:20] I'd like you to turn with me for this to
[1:09:22] do to Romany two and verse four if you
[1:09:25] will and command out the people saying
[1:09:28] you're to pass through the coasts of
[1:09:31] your brethren to children of Esau which
[1:09:34] dwell and seer and they shall be afraid
[1:09:38] of you taking good heed unto yourself
[1:09:40] therefore metal not with them for I will
[1:09:44] not give you of their land no not so
[1:09:48] much as a foot breath because I have
[1:09:52] given Mount Seir unto Esau for
[1:09:55] possession then you look down at verse
[1:09:58] nine and the Lord said unto me distress
[1:10:02] not the Moabites neither continue
[1:10:05] them in battle well I will not give you
[1:10:07] their land for a possession because I
[1:10:11] have given air unto the children of lot
[1:10:14] for a possession so you can see here
[1:10:18] there are different portions that are
[1:10:21] given and and Israel was told now don't
[1:10:25] try to take what belongs to Esau and
[1:10:28] don't try to take what belongs to Moab
[1:10:31] I've actually given them that portion if
[1:10:35] you look in the book of Revelation there
[1:10:37] is a great number that come up out of
[1:10:41] Great Tribulation a multitude without
[1:10:43] number and this is a church
[1:10:46] this is not our portion and then the
[1:10:49] bride leaves before the tribulation
[1:10:51] comes in and then you got the 144,000
[1:10:56] and and their inheritance that is not a
[1:10:59] portion we're not trying to God will not
[1:11:02] give us not one foot breadth in that
[1:11:06] land of theirs it is their land it is
[1:11:10] their promised land but for us you see
[1:11:15] our joshua has done the same thing you
[1:11:18] know and he says now here's the bride's
[1:11:20] portion here's the church's portion and
[1:11:23] here's 144,000 portion and we are not to
[1:11:27] try to take what is allotted to another
[1:11:30] are you with me
[1:11:31] so now it was very important that these
[1:11:35] things be defined for us for example if
[1:11:38] the visa if the seven trumpets were not
[1:11:40] defined for us as to who they were far
[1:11:44] we would be expecting to fulfill that
[1:11:46] but because they define for us who that
[1:11:49] they are far then we don't have to worry
[1:11:52] about that portion God's not going to
[1:11:54] give us that portion so in the Feast of
[1:11:57] Trumpets brother Branham said now here
[1:11:59] is the calling out time at the sixth
[1:12:02] seal one is open to persecution struck
[1:12:04] the Jews in the literal standpoint and
[1:12:07] here comes a persecution to the church
[1:12:08] in the ecclesiastical standpoint because
[1:12:11] the bride has already called the
[1:12:13] Sabbath's are over and ready for the
[1:12:15] Jews to be called wear to the feast of
[1:12:18] atone
[1:12:19] though Church don't you see that call to
[1:12:21] the feast of atonement to recognize your
[1:12:24] tomb it not no more as chickens and
[1:12:26] geese and what they've been doing but
[1:12:28] the Lamb of God slain from the
[1:12:30] foundation of the world and Israel's
[1:12:32] gone to know that and then again there
[1:12:35] in recognizing your day in his message
[1:12:38] which comes right on the next Sunday
[1:12:42] after they feast the trumpets that
[1:12:45] brother Branham preaches he said I'm
[1:12:46] gonna say something not national force
[1:12:49] but Israel in her homeland national
[1:12:53] force will put the church in the World
[1:12:55] Council of Churches but the power God
[1:12:58] will put people in the bride the world
[1:13:01] forces this way and the world forces
[1:13:04] that way but God forces upward and the
[1:13:07] Spirit of God which is the Word of God
[1:13:08] my word of spirit in life will put the
[1:13:11] bride in her place
[1:13:13] Amen cuz she will recognize her position
[1:13:18] in the word then she's in Christ we'll
[1:13:21] put her in her place no national force
[1:13:23] will do it but the national force did
[1:13:26] drive Israel to their homeland
[1:13:28] then national forces of the Council of
[1:13:31] Churches will drive every organization
[1:13:34] into it but the power of God will raise
[1:13:37] the bride in the glory out of it man I
[1:13:41] still believe there's to be a people who
[1:13:42] will escape the things that are coming
[1:13:44] on the earth a man again and Feast of
[1:13:48] Trumpets brother Branham talks about
[1:13:49] this he says I'm you know how what is it
[1:13:54] done in the cunningness as he said he
[1:13:57] coming with flatteries what's he done
[1:13:59] bringing the Protestant promised an
[1:14:01] ecumenical council of the world churches
[1:14:04] a spirit of Antichrist among both of
[1:14:06] them bringing them to the slaughter just
[1:14:09] like they did the other in the hour to
[1:14:10] call the bride how loosed of all in the
[1:14:13] ecclesiastical spirit loosed upon what
[1:14:17] not upon the denominations but upon the
[1:14:20] bride and here you'll get it the bride
[1:14:23] will not go through that time the Bible
[1:14:26] says not the church will but not the
[1:14:29] bride can't you see ministers can't you
[1:14:31] see that
[1:14:31] rather you say the church has to go to
[1:14:34] the persecution for the perfection of it
[1:14:36] he says the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:14:38] perfects the bride a man who chooses a
[1:14:41] wife don't put her through a lot of
[1:14:43] punishment she's found grace to with her
[1:14:46] and she's found grace with him and he
[1:14:48] engages to her and if there's anything
[1:14:51] he'll keep her from every place to turn
[1:14:54] her hand His grace is so great about
[1:14:57] them a man now let me just talk about
[1:15:03] this for a moment don't think we're
[1:15:07] exempt from flu or viruses or diseases
[1:15:11] our cancers or troubles or anything
[1:15:14] we're still human however if we get them
[1:15:18] I just want to tell you is not something
[1:15:20] from God he said I'll put none of these
[1:15:24] diseases among you upon you brother
[1:15:27] Branham too connected the tightening of
[1:15:29] the skin and the squeeze to the third
[1:15:31] pole which was the coming of the word in
[1:15:35] here and he says what's the third pulled
[1:15:37] in but and there's a direct connection
[1:15:40] between the two the squeeze in the third
[1:15:43] pull but the squeeze isn't natural then
[1:15:47] that demon powers are loosed upon the
[1:15:49] bride in the in the spiritual
[1:15:51] ecclesiastical round and the physical
[1:15:55] persecution of worldwide plagues and
[1:15:58] diseases and tribulation falls after the
[1:16:01] bride is taken away so the whole world
[1:16:04] is going to right now financial physical
[1:16:07] emotional stress due to the coronavirus
[1:16:11] and I just say we're not immune to any
[1:16:13] of that the plague that the that the
[1:16:17] bride is immune from is spiritual death
[1:16:23] let me say it again
[1:16:25] you know the world is going through
[1:16:27] financial physical and emotional stress
[1:16:30] due to the coronavirus and we're not
[1:16:35] immune to any of it you have downturns
[1:16:42] and economies you have stock market
[1:16:44] crisis you lose money here you do your
[1:16:48] business doesn't do well this year we're
[1:16:51] not immune from trouble we're not immune
[1:16:54] from diseases don't think don't go to
[1:16:58] thinking that you know we're just saying
[1:17:00] we got we're immune when it won't touch
[1:17:03] us the plague that the bride is immune
[1:17:06] from is spiritual death amount and those
[1:17:14] demon powers will oppose the anointing
[1:17:18] all the gifts of the Spirit divine
[1:17:20] healing prayer lines altar calls worship
[1:17:22] the persecution of the squeeze will be
[1:17:25] against us word for this age that's why
[1:17:29] brother Branham said we we need a
[1:17:30] spiritual awakening to to discernment
[1:17:34] and light of the last plague we've got
[1:17:36] to realize you know what what is our
[1:17:38] real serious threat and our real serious
[1:17:42] threat is not this coronavirus it is
[1:17:46] that Laodicean spirit of death that is
[1:17:49] coming in the last day that makes people
[1:17:52] lukewarm cold and powerless and that
[1:17:55] attacks the anointing and the moving of
[1:17:58] the Spirit and the worship of God and
[1:18:00] the Holy Ghost being free to move into
[1:18:02] church and so I want you to understand
[1:18:08] that we we must accept all the Word of
[1:18:13] God we will not be compelled to give up
[1:18:16] our full inheritance amongst we are the
[1:18:19] anointed one for this day and for this
[1:18:22] reason we have come and man and so now
[1:18:26] as we are speaking about that this
[1:18:29] morning I want to just draw your
[1:18:30] attention back to the subject that we
[1:18:33] have been talking about and that is
[1:18:36] about the about the the abstract of the
[1:18:41] title deed is heaven has moved in our
[1:18:44] generation as the lamb takes the book
[1:18:48] had to loose the seals and then they
[1:18:50] give that book of inheritance back to
[1:18:53] the believer
[1:18:54] which means that we're going to someone
[1:18:57] in this generation I believe it is you
[1:18:59] and me with all my heart I believe we're
[1:19:02] the generation that is going to walk
[1:19:04] into the full inheritance in other words
[1:19:08] everything that Adam lost we will regain
[1:19:11] first by the change of our bodies from
[1:19:15] mortal back to immortality
[1:19:17] now this has typed out in many many of
[1:19:21] the scriptures and of course it is shown
[1:19:23] in the book of Revelation that we have
[1:19:25] been through as a book that was sealed
[1:19:27] and nobody could look upon it until a
[1:19:30] man was declared worthy to take the book
[1:19:33] and to loose the seals and by loosen the
[1:19:36] seals he was removing the claims that
[1:19:39] was keeping the book from being open and
[1:19:42] these these had been had been sealed
[1:19:45] down to the ages by the spirit of the
[1:19:47] Antichrist that it sealed the truth of
[1:19:50] the word away from us but it is being
[1:19:52] opened here in this last day
[1:19:54] when we come back to the gospel that
[1:19:57] Paul preached now in the Old Testament
[1:20:01] there are many many types that types our
[1:20:04] age and this all we can do is look back
[1:20:07] and we can see what God's done in the
[1:20:10] past and we can see as in the shadow
[1:20:13] that is created or what is coming what
[1:20:17] is coming from the from the dead from
[1:20:20] the negative to the positive now in the
[1:20:23] Old Testament there was two major crops
[1:20:26] that came to harvest there would be the
[1:20:29] barley would ripen first around the
[1:20:32] Passover season and then the wheat
[1:20:35] harvest would be some fifty days later
[1:20:38] at Pentecost and before they can begin
[1:20:41] the harvest and eat of its bounty the
[1:20:45] Israel would take the first ripened
[1:20:47] grains and bring them before the priests
[1:20:50] to offer to God the first fruits of the
[1:20:53] harvest as a wave offering before God
[1:20:56] and that was actually me to wavings of
[1:21:00] the sheaf one would be for the barley
[1:21:03] season and
[1:21:05] happens the day after the Passover that
[1:21:08] correspondent exactly with the same time
[1:21:11] of Jesus resurrection but while the high
[1:21:14] priest was waving the barley grain
[1:21:17] offering Jesus appears at the tomb as
[1:21:20] seen by the disciples and he was the
[1:21:23] first of the resurrection for he was the
[1:21:26] first from among the dead and and of
[1:21:30] course with him came the Old Testament
[1:21:32] Saints which we'll read about in a
[1:21:34] moment then there would be seven weeks
[1:21:37] that would follow the Passover these
[1:21:40] seven weeks would be called the feast of
[1:21:43] weeks and the Pentecost seven weeks
[1:21:46] later on the fiftieth day was the waving
[1:21:50] of the sheaf marking the beginning of
[1:21:53] the wheat harvest now on the on that
[1:21:57] same day the Holy Ghost fell and it came
[1:22:00] with the sound of a rushing mighty wind
[1:22:03] and tongues of fire came upon 120 as the
[1:22:07] Holy Spirit was waved over the people
[1:22:09] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:22:13] we noticed that the deer two distinct
[1:22:17] crops ripen at two distinct times the
[1:22:22] Old Testament Saints they have already
[1:22:24] been harvested right a man though wheat
[1:22:29] harvest comes seven weeks or seven
[1:22:32] Church ages later and it is time for the
[1:22:37] harvest of all the ages hallelujah
[1:22:42] hey man so the chief was Christ the
[1:22:46] firstfruits of the resurrection he
[1:22:49] really even was rose again and was waved
[1:22:52] over the people and proved that he was
[1:22:54] not dead but he is alive forevermore and
[1:22:58] the Old Testament Saints were harvested
[1:23:02] with him and rose from the dead with him
[1:23:05] Matthew 27 52 and the graves were open
[1:23:09] and many of the bodies of the saints
[1:23:12] which slept arose and came out of the
[1:23:14] graves after his resurrection and went
[1:23:17] into the holy city and a
[1:23:19] peered unto me so you see he was the
[1:23:23] first to rise but when he rose they rose
[1:23:27] with him because it was the beginning of
[1:23:30] the harvest the barley harvest are the
[1:23:33] harvests of the Old Testament Saints and
[1:23:35] they they were typed by that barley
[1:23:38] harvest now again this chief wavin
[1:23:42] happened on Sunday it would be the first
[1:23:45] day of the week and this would mark then
[1:23:48] the beginning of the countdown to
[1:23:52] Pentecost so it would actually begin a
[1:23:55] countdown from the time of Jesus
[1:23:59] resurrection to the day of Pentecost
[1:24:02] which would be seven weeks under
[1:24:06] Pentecost now again they would also
[1:24:09] fulfill another type and looking at the
[1:24:12] type and looking at the types this
[1:24:14] morning I want to just say again the
[1:24:16] barley harvest is over with and the
[1:24:20] first fruit was accepted and the Old
[1:24:24] Testament Saints rose and the countdown
[1:24:28] began and it began with Ephesus Smyrna
[1:24:32] Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia
[1:24:35] and Laodicea seven church ages
[1:24:39] a man representing the seven weeks but
[1:24:43] at the finishing of the week the day of
[1:24:46] Pentecost fully comes are you with me
[1:24:50] now brother Branham spoke about another
[1:24:53] Shifa waving here at the end time and I
[1:24:57] just want to go over them and I'm just
[1:24:59] going to take snippets from it is the
[1:25:01] rising of the Sun as he talks about it
[1:25:04] he says and it's to be waved
[1:25:06] again if we realize in the last day
[1:25:09] according to st. Luke 1730
[1:25:12] which you know was as it was in the days
[1:25:14] of lot so shall it be in the and the
[1:25:18] revealing of the Son of Man so again
[1:25:20] we're here in the days just before the
[1:25:23] burning of the earth right where the bow
[1:25:26] before the fire falls but before he
[1:25:29] comes there's to be a safeway
[1:25:32] and that sheaf wave is the revealing
[1:25:35] when the son of man the word is revealed
[1:25:38] again made known to the people but it's
[1:25:42] more than just a revealing of the word
[1:25:45] and the knowledge of the message it is
[1:25:48] absolutely the taking on flesh in a
[1:25:52] people because remember this is
[1:25:54] Pentecost if it's pretty cost is where
[1:25:58] the word is written in the nature of the
[1:26:00] people it's not a collection of books
[1:26:03] it's not an external religion it's not
[1:26:06] saying well we got the word and but the
[1:26:09] word is a person and that person comes
[1:26:12] in you and the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:15] and it comes in your life and you become
[1:26:18] a sheep wave before the world that Jesus
[1:26:23] Christ lives hallelujah dizzi this is
[1:26:27] what Philip would stand up there this
[1:26:28] morning and say listen you got a lost
[1:26:31] husband out there but here I am a
[1:26:34] pressed fruit hey man I'm the one of the
[1:26:38] first one of the first fruits right here
[1:26:40] and I'm suing you that God can save a
[1:26:43] lost husband and we're waving it before
[1:26:47] the world that the prodigal will come
[1:26:49] home hallelujah are you with me remember
[1:26:54] is a way before the world that God can
[1:26:57] take a man or a woman that's lust and
[1:26:59] sin and turn their lives around
[1:27:02] and wave them in their community amen
[1:27:05] show in Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:27:07] today and forever
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:15] brother branham would top this and he
[1:27:19] would use this terminology now we know
[1:27:22] he 2,000 years ago it was the groom
[1:27:24] coming to Christ and we're not looking
[1:27:28] for Jesus to come walking down among us
[1:27:30] when taking a seat in our pews or
[1:27:33] walking beside us on some dusty road or
[1:27:37] a man dressed in sandals and and walking
[1:27:42] among us like that no we we we meet him
[1:27:45] in the air in this coming a man is more
[1:27:49] of a going away than it is a coming
[1:27:51] though it is a coming because we meet
[1:27:54] halfway like Isaac met Rebecca in the
[1:27:57] field and then took her to her home so
[1:28:00] God meets us here Jesus meets us here
[1:28:03] and so it again it is the coming of the
[1:28:06] Lord but I want you to understand it's
[1:28:09] more than the coming of the physical man
[1:28:11] Jesus it is in brother branham's
[1:28:15] terminology in the bride coming of
[1:28:18] Christ coming out of the church and the
[1:28:21] last day there's to be a sheaf waved
[1:28:24] again in the last days and then he says
[1:28:29] and for the first time that will come
[1:28:32] forth for the bride aids for a
[1:28:34] resurrection out of dark
[1:28:36] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:28:40] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:28:43] back in power and it's being waved over
[1:28:46] the people by the same signs of wonders
[1:28:49] that he did back there the word which he
[1:28:51] was was way back to them on the day of
[1:28:54] Pentecost the word made manifest so
[1:28:58] brother Branham again says but in the
[1:29:00] bride age right here in this last date
[1:29:03] in the bride coming of Christ cuz he
[1:29:07] came as groom 2,000 years ago but how
[1:29:10] he's coming in this ages first he'll be
[1:29:13] manifested in bride form it is fullness
[1:29:16] in a mature form for the marriage of the
[1:29:19] lamb has come
[1:29:21] and you don't marry an infant but a
[1:29:25] mature elect lady that's why I was
[1:29:27] preaching about adoption last Sunday
[1:29:29] because this is a mature age it is a
[1:29:32] maturing message it is a perfecting
[1:29:36] message it is an adopting message it is
[1:29:40] placing you in the body of Christ a man
[1:29:44] as with a party with power and that's
[1:29:48] what I would you to understand this
[1:29:50] message does for you it places you in a
[1:29:53] position of power or pain a position of
[1:29:56] authority a man that said tells you
[1:29:59] Satan is under your feet whatever you
[1:30:01] bind I'll bind it
[1:30:03] whatever you lose I'll loose and then
[1:30:06] you use my name come on man whatever you
[1:30:11] ask in my name I'll do it what is it
[1:30:15] it's the son acting in the father's name
[1:30:18] and that's what happens in the
[1:30:21] procurement of Christ it ALS power is
[1:30:25] more power it's the same Jesus and a
[1:30:30] multiplied form are you with me now then
[1:30:37] he would say and now as I say I'm just
[1:30:40] reading these snippets and now as I say
[1:30:43] it's to be waved again at the last day
[1:30:45] so we let me just go back over some of
[1:30:49] these it's me waved again we realized in
[1:30:52] the last days according to Luke 1730 in
[1:30:55] the bride coming of Christ coming out of
[1:30:58] the church to me as she waved again in
[1:30:59] the last days then he says for the bride
[1:31:03] age for resurrection out of dock
[1:31:06] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:31:09] the full maturity of the word is turned
[1:31:11] back and its full power and it's being
[1:31:14] waved over the people by the same signs
[1:31:17] and wonders that he did back there the
[1:31:20] word which he was whose way back to them
[1:31:22] on the day of Pentecost the word made
[1:31:25] manifest and now I say it is to be waved
[1:31:29] again in the last day
[1:31:33] so now how can there be the waving of
[1:31:37] the sheath unless we are at the harvest
[1:31:41] of our harvest come on how can there be
[1:31:46] a waving of the sheath if this is not an
[1:31:49] appealing cost and then so then the day
[1:31:54] of Pentecost had fully come it is
[1:31:58] building types before us typed out there
[1:32:03] on Mount Sinai 50 days after the
[1:32:06] Passover and the log comes down and
[1:32:08] written upon stone it would be typed out
[1:32:11] again 50 days after the Passover there
[1:32:15] the Holy Spirit come to write the word
[1:32:18] of hearts but there comes a time where
[1:32:22] it's no more the type anymore are you
[1:32:26] with me and man the day of Pentecost had
[1:32:29] fully come and it must be the Pentecost
[1:32:32] of all Pentecost a man it must be the
[1:32:35] jubilee of all Jubilees then this
[1:32:40] requires that the leaves are the debts
[1:32:44] on the book be paid so that every slave
[1:32:48] can go free and this requires that the
[1:32:51] lamb began to take the book and loose
[1:32:55] the seals and remove the lanes or remove
[1:32:59] the debts remove the things that kept us
[1:33:02] from going than the complete Liberty
[1:33:05] remember it could not eat and nobody
[1:33:08] could go into liberty until the day of
[1:33:12] the Jubilee and then so I ever dad if
[1:33:16] you went into that you sold your
[1:33:17] property it was it was sold until the
[1:33:20] day of Jubilee so if you're thirty years
[1:33:22] and to that fiftieth year then it's only
[1:33:25] 20 years that it's in that it's in a
[1:33:28] kept in and so you know but when it's
[1:33:31] chilly then it is time that everything
[1:33:35] go free hallelujah hey man do you
[1:33:40] realize them the things that you have
[1:33:43] been looking for you
[1:33:44] here in that day in time where the
[1:33:47] jubilee trumpet is sounding saying that
[1:33:50] you can have salvation not just a little
[1:33:54] bit like Luther had or sanctification
[1:33:56] like Wesley had become like Pentecost
[1:33:59] had but the fullness of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:02] returned back in the fullness of its
[1:34:04] power and then because why with the word
[1:34:08] comes and experience with the word comes
[1:34:11] up power remember this when you come
[1:34:17] back to true doctor you come back to the
[1:34:20] same doctrine of Jesus and when Jesus
[1:34:24] doctored it always was accompanied with
[1:34:27] signs and wonders never speak a man like
[1:34:31] this man I never have we heard a word
[1:34:34] like this never has what manner where is
[1:34:38] this for he speaks not as a scribe not
[1:34:41] as a theologian come on now the message
[1:34:46] wouldn't come to make us theologians the
[1:34:49] message was come to give us a power for
[1:34:58] the words he speaks with authority but
[1:35:02] with authority he commands his spirits
[1:35:04] and they obey Him sickness and disease
[1:35:09] are septic to him hey man if that was
[1:35:12] done in the groom what must be done in
[1:35:15] the bride because there's some be a
[1:35:17] chief wait come on in the entire so this
[1:35:25] requires it as I was saying that the
[1:35:27] lens of the debts on the book be paid
[1:35:30] and every slave can go free
[1:35:33] every land that has been held in bondage
[1:35:35] whether it's the land of healing the
[1:35:38] land of miracles the land of signs and
[1:35:41] wonders the land of predestination the
[1:35:45] land of eternal security the land
[1:35:47] whatever it is whatever part every
[1:35:50] portion is released
[1:35:52] when the book is open it's all released
[1:35:56] this is why brother Branham would tell
[1:35:58] us in the Feast of Trumpets said the
[1:36:00] nomination that's bound that movement of
[1:36:03] the Holy Spirit for these two thousand
[1:36:05] years but it's being unloose it's being
[1:36:09] released by the entire message
[1:36:12] hallelujah when we preach this message
[1:36:15] in the right way he'll release healing
[1:36:18] to you it'll release deliverance to you
[1:36:20] he'll release salvation to your loved
[1:36:22] ones
[1:36:23] it won't take it away and I release it
[1:36:25] now this is a fulfillment of all types
[1:36:35] let's just talk about it for a minute
[1:36:38] the feast of unleavened bread was seven
[1:36:42] days without leaven this would type
[1:36:45] seven Church ages where we worked have
[1:36:48] been fed the pure Word of God is again
[1:36:52] that Passover that the blood must be
[1:36:55] applied the token which is the Holy
[1:36:59] Ghost
[1:36:59] it is the Jubilee wherever slave can go
[1:37:03] free it is the last of the seven weeks
[1:37:06] of the feast of weeks the heart of the
[1:37:09] barley harvest of the Old Testament was
[1:37:12] finished and here 728 in his lair the
[1:37:16] harvest begins as a sheath is weighed
[1:37:20] now following the pattern it's not just
[1:37:24] going to bring a resurrection out of
[1:37:26] dark denominationalism back to the word
[1:37:28] again but it's going to do more than
[1:37:31] that it's going to raise the dead of
[1:37:33] seven ages this is the complete Jubilee
[1:37:37] that those who are just assets or just
[1:37:41] crumbs and you can't even find a
[1:37:44] microscope of their body worth it
[1:37:46] doesn't matter he'll create again and
[1:37:50] they'll stand again from the seven Asia
[1:37:52] Europe a match to believe things that is
[1:37:56] more than you feel on a cancer
[1:37:58] just more than healing a heart trouble
[1:38:01] you have been asked to believe that God
[1:38:04] in our generation will take an old man
[1:38:07] or woman and restore him back to youth
[1:38:10] again take the dead have a seven ages
[1:38:13] that rise him again change to the moment
[1:38:18] in a twinkling of an eye the bride will
[1:38:27] be waved as the first-fruit the bride
[1:38:30] aged for the resurrection out of dark
[1:38:33] denominationalism will be a message this
[1:38:37] is a jubilee message and the jubilee
[1:38:40] message says that the form maturity of
[1:38:43] the word what's adoption for maturity
[1:38:46] that's what adoption is full maturity
[1:38:48] the full minority of the word has turned
[1:38:51] again in this full power and being waved
[1:38:56] over the people by the same signs and
[1:39:00] wonders that he did back there so again
[1:39:05] those that are resurrected out of the
[1:39:07] dock denominationalism they will be way
[1:39:10] that as as a sheep that the phone the
[1:39:14] journey of the word listen it's a
[1:39:16] message are you with me you want to

[1:39:51] that word a God and God adds his word to
[1:39:56] be on flesh and our day an hour
[1:39:58] why a pinnacle it was not written in
[1:40:01] stone it was written in the heart it was
[1:40:06] a change in nature and this bride is a
[1:40:13] freshman it's the first ones that broke
[1:40:18] off the yoke of Luther Wesley Pentecost

[1:42:58] it's the rising of the Sun it's the
[1:43:02] dispelling of darkness brother Branham
[1:43:06] would say of this quoting the scripture
[1:43:09] because I live you live also speak into
[1:43:13] his wife there again not it's not about
[1:43:17] mimicking or impersonate you know or you

[1:43:24] never try to be the seventh messenger
[1:43:26] neither should you hey man but we can't
[1:43:30] be Jesus who is greater than the seventh
[1:43:33] messenger come on amen because I live
[1:43:37] you live also speaking his wife because
[1:43:40] I live you live on so what a
[1:43:42] resurrection that was and what a
[1:43:45] resurrection this is to be quickened
[1:43:49] from the dead to me to be a little
[1:43:52] in Christ Jesus but God's quickening
[1:43:55] power he was waved to them the word
[1:43:57] which he was he was waved to the back to
[1:43:59] them on the day of Pentecost the word
[1:44:01] made manifest and now I say it's to be a
[1:44:04] wave again in this last day we have an
[1:44:11] abstract of title that has given us an
[1:44:15] open book what was closed what had been
[1:44:20] hidden what was veiled from other ages
[1:44:23] is now open to us the land is yours
[1:44:29] hello
[1:44:30] the Covenant is the deed to it but the
[1:44:34] enemy that possesses it and his claims
[1:44:37] to you must be stricken off now I want
[1:44:44] to bring this down forever believer
[1:44:45] today forever believer they receive the
[1:44:49] word of promise of and ahead of an
[1:44:50] inheritance but then every claim against
[1:44:55] you as a believer must be stricken off I
[1:45:02] want to say that you must have more than
[1:45:05] a deed anyone can pick up a Bible and
[1:45:10] say I have a title amen these promises
[1:45:16] are mine but you as an individual must
[1:45:21] have the Holy Spirit which is the
[1:45:23] abstract of title and he is the
[1:45:26] guarantee of your rights to every
[1:45:30] promise now an abstract of title is
[1:45:35] where the deed has been searched and all
[1:45:38] claims against it has been settled and
[1:45:42] that's what the Holy Ghost when he does
[1:45:45] it does when he comes to your life he
[1:45:48] comes down and he searches out
[1:45:49] everything in your life and he clears
[1:45:53] out the deed all the claims come on
[1:45:57] somebody all the claims that the devil
[1:45:59] had against you your past
[1:46:03] a man your habits the world said every
[1:46:09] claim the devil had on you when the Holy
[1:46:12] Ghost comes he cancels to death he pays
[1:46:16] the death and he gives you an abstract
[1:46:18] he gives you a seal saying I have
[1:46:22] examined the title and I've been Savin
[1:46:25] his title and his title is clear his
[1:46:28] name is hallelujah
[1:46:39] they are heir to every promise and the
[1:46:42] Holy Ghost is the abstract that clears
[1:46:47] your deed that white so in your past
[1:46:50] that cleanses you of ever false doctrine
[1:46:53] of everything that was hold you back has
[1:46:57] been cleared by the blood of the Lamb
[1:47:00] [Applause]
[1:47:02] every man was born in sin Satan that
[1:47:07] claims against him but when they
[1:47:09] believed the Lord and believed on him
[1:47:12] they had the deed but when they received
[1:47:15] the Holy Ghost
[1:47:16] it was the abstract to the deed showing
[1:47:21] that everything against him is struck
[1:47:23] off would like to just share with you
[1:47:25] some of this from the Easter seal and
[1:47:27] bear with me as we go through this but
[1:47:33] he said when they went up to Pentecost
[1:47:35] there they received the quickening power
[1:47:39] the power that made them alive now
[1:47:43] that's where I think you Presbyterian
[1:47:45] and Methodist brothers you do receive
[1:47:48] potentially on believing on the Lord
[1:47:50] Jesus Christ but the abstract hasn't
[1:47:53] come yet
[1:47:53] that's the clearing of the deed God gave
[1:47:57] Abraham a promise and abraham believed
[1:47:59] god it was imputed in him righteousness
[1:48:01] but he's he sealed the Covenant by the
[1:48:04] seal of circumcision and God gives you a
[1:48:07] promise potentially that you will
[1:48:10] receive it that you're going to be
[1:48:11] you're going to be raised up and this
[1:48:13] body is going to be glorified we
[1:48:15] at the end time but you see you have to
[1:48:17] get a clearance on that D and the
[1:48:21] clearance is when everything against it
[1:48:25] is struck off a man and you've got the
[1:48:28] abstract to us you've got the seal that
[1:48:31] is yours everything all that belongs to
[1:48:34] you and when we believe on Jesus Christ
[1:48:37] our Savior and repent in are baptized
[1:48:41] and come up to believe him God
[1:48:44] recognizes I repentance and our faith
[1:48:47] toward him and since down the abstract
[1:48:50] and the abstract is the assurance it is
[1:48:53] a guarantee that everything that was
[1:48:56] ever held against you you've thoroughly
[1:48:58] repented hallelujah and the property is
[1:49:01] button and you hold the abstract for the
[1:49:05] assurance let somebody then try to put
[1:49:08] you off the land and say he behold you
[1:49:11] have the abstract in your hand
[1:49:13] Lane trying to attain a law in the land
[1:49:16] that can do it because you hold the
[1:49:19] abstract and there's no devil no church
[1:49:23] in its theology can ever overstep the
[1:49:27] boundaries of God's proof of abstract
[1:49:29] that the baptism of the holy ghost has
[1:49:32] recognized us in Jesus Christ and we're
[1:49:35] sure to raise as he raised because
[1:49:37] potentially we're already raised with
[1:49:40] him in the old things what does it do to
[1:49:43] your mortal bodies it turns our opinion
[1:49:46] it changes our no sense it sets our
[1:49:50] affections on things that are above and
[1:49:52] the smokin the drinkin the gamblin the
[1:49:55] things you used to do is dead and it's
[1:49:59] beneath you and you are quickened and
[1:50:02] this quickening power brings your body
[1:50:04] into a raptured condition in other words
[1:50:08] it cleanses you from sin and you're
[1:50:11] ready for the rapture oh man I want you
[1:50:14] to know by the coming of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:16] in your life the token it made you
[1:50:19] rapture

[1:50:23] meeting to be ready because Kovac 19 is
[1:50:26] in the air the Holy Ghost is only sealed
[1:50:29] us to the day of redemption hallelujah a
[1:50:33] man if we tell who we are
[1:50:35] oh he said there on the day of Pentecost
[1:50:38] when those group in ik also group up
[1:50:40] there on the day of Pentecost received
[1:50:42] their abstract deed it glorified their
[1:50:47] souls they screamed they saw tongues of
[1:50:51] fire separated upon each of them and
[1:50:53] it's so quick in their body till they
[1:50:56] couldn't even speak in an earthly
[1:50:58] language anymore it quicken their body
[1:51:01] to a heavenly language the place that
[1:51:04] they're going to the quickening power
[1:51:06] shut their mortal bodies so that their
[1:51:09] entire mortal language was transfigured
[1:51:12] or transformed into a immortal language
[1:51:16] what a quickening power a man something
[1:51:21] that belongs and if the spirit that
[1:51:23] raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in
[1:51:25] your mortal body it's also quicken your
[1:51:27] mortal bodies we are quicken them by the
[1:51:29] power of the Living God tongues or we
[1:51:35] don't want them today but comes quicken
[1:51:38] to a heavenly language to speak to them
[1:51:41] a rapture enough hallelujah raising up
[1:51:46] and to a different atmosphere than what
[1:51:47] they never lived in you know what
[1:51:50] happened to you when the Holy Ghost came

[1:52:42] quicken that promise to them therefore
[1:52:44] they laid hands on the sick and they
[1:52:47] were healed they spoke in new tongues
[1:52:49] they've done great signs and wonders
[1:52:51] because that was in God's promise and
[1:52:54] when Jesus died to redeem that back to
[1:52:56] them the grounds that belonged to the
[1:52:58] sons of God he demonstrated what God was
[1:53:02] Jesus demonstrated the grounds we are

[1:55:07] believe that is the and their assurance
[1:55:10] and when we see a group of people a man
[1:55:14] manifesting themselves that is assurance
[1:55:17] that the abstract is there to vindicate
[1:55:20] that that is the prophecy the property
[1:55:23] of God amen
[1:55:25] Oh hallelujah listen when we see it in a
[1:55:27] group of people when we see the Holy
[1:55:30] Spirit moving when we see him in our
[1:55:34] worship when we see lives have been
[1:55:36] changed when we see the sick has been
[1:55:39] healed when we see the cancer has been
[1:55:42] repulsed when we see that brave leads
[1:55:44] had paid it away when we see the
[1:55:46] crippled children whoa hallelujah that's
[1:55:50] the assurance the abstract is there to
[1:55:54] vindicate that is the property of God
[1:55:59] hallelujah I want to put the devil on
[1:56:01] notice today we are God's property and
[1:56:05] Satan you gotta take your hands up
[1:56:08] adopts property and furthermore every
[1:56:13] promise in this word gives God's
[1:56:16] property and ever get against us has
[1:56:19] been paid and we are the redeemed and
[1:56:24] Satan you gotta get your dirty stuff off
[1:56:27] of our property
[1:56:28] [Applause]
[1:56:30] because we are in an Easter we are in a
[1:56:35] time the resurrection a man wearing the
[1:56:38] time metal suffered stands and be healed
[1:56:41] we're not tagging he says I am the
[1:56:43] resurrection and the life and there's a
[1:56:48] people beginning to realize I am that
[1:56:50] resurrection promised in this last day
[1:56:53] it has begin with me I'm the first fruit
[1:56:57] of it unless we raised from the dead
[1:57:03] either doctor not nationalism there
[1:57:06] would be no hope for the resurrection of
[1:57:07] the ages so God made you a first fruit
[1:57:17] that you can experience the exact same
[1:57:20] experience that came down on the day of
[1:57:23] Pentecost that you too could have that
[1:57:26] same Pentecostal experience were the
[1:57:29] word no mores in books and tapes and on
[1:57:34] tablets of stone but it's taken and
[1:57:37] written in your nature changes your
[1:57:42] thickens and your your affections put
[1:57:45] some on things above so he said we are
[1:57:48] Easter also we are now in our Easter
[1:57:53] little bride I'm trying to tell you
[1:57:55] something around the world we are in and
[1:57:58] Easter
[1:57:59] this is Resurrection hour hallelujah you
[1:58:03] cannot have that harvest unless there's
[1:58:06] a first fruit
[1:58:10] [Applause]
[1:58:13] thank God
[1:58:15] waves his people in this generation Oh
[1:58:20] No
[1:58:22] when Jesus was waved there before them
[1:58:25] show that I am Alive I'm not dead called
[1:58:29] Mary Magdalene by name Mary he was on a
[1:58:35] public show it wasn't a worldwide
[1:58:39] sweeping thing come on it was an
[1:58:42] appearing to the elect and that's what
[1:58:46] he does in this last day in this time he
[1:58:48] appears to the elect and he shows you
[1:58:52] you're not dead
[1:58:54] you're not dead in sins and trespasses
[1:58:57] you're not dead in cold call creeds and
[1:59:00] denominationalism you are and I'm going
[1:59:05] to show your life I'm gonna demonstrate
[1:59:08] it in your life hallelujah amen notice
[1:59:17] notice this brother Branham calls us a
[1:59:20] Pentecostal experience you must
[1:59:24] experience Pentecost many customers who
[1:59:29] live in others sheet you must experience
[1:59:31] Pentecost he's clear about this
[1:59:35] Pentecost is not an organization it is
[1:59:39] an experience and it is one you must
[1:59:43] experience
[1:59:45] you see they waited in the upper room in
[1:59:48] a hundred and twenty collectively
[1:59:50] received it and then three thousand
[1:59:52] souls were added but with the Gentiles
[1:59:55] they received it individually at the
[1:59:59] house of Cornelius and other places
[2:00:01] throughout the book of Acts so you're
[2:00:05] not looking for 120 of us or 3,000 like
[2:00:09] this or that and big crowds and so on
[2:00:12] and I am one be outpoured it's not
[2:00:15] moving and meeting an individual here
[2:00:17] having an experience with Cornelius he
[2:00:20] I'm there or with these over here a
[2:00:24] little group over there pieces of
[2:00:25] Ephesus over here and over there and
[2:00:28] over there every one of you at separate
[2:00:31] times and then receive your Pentecostal
[2:00:38] hallelujah the day received it yet the
[2:00:41] promises to you and to our children and
[2:00:45] to them that are far off and it as many
[2:00:47] as the Lord our God shall call he's
[2:00:51] still callin hallelujah
[2:00:54] doors ain't closed yet hallelujah fact
[2:00:58] the book has been open and it's calling
[2:00:59] all the names who's not shut them up is
[2:01:03] calling the names the same Holy Ghost
[2:01:11] that fell there in the tight on the day
[2:01:15] of Pentecost engage the church a clear
[2:01:18] deed then it must come and give you
[2:01:22] clearance if you're going in the rapture
[2:01:25] let me share from you
[2:01:27] it is the rising of the Sun brother
[2:01:31] Branham says like the Pentecostal
[2:01:34] experienced today and the coming of the
[2:01:37] Holy Ghost in the last days is promised
[2:01:40] it's like the abstract to a title deed
[2:01:45] so those are you two don't want
[2:01:47] Pentecost I don't know what you're gonna
[2:01:49] do because pen this is the truth
[2:01:53] Pentecost you see he would tell us and
[2:01:57] it is if the restoration of right tree
[2:01:59] that he said you know the first day
[2:02:04] Jesus is dead in the tomb Luther second
[2:02:08] day he's dead in the tomb Wesley
[2:02:10] because why it was killed on a Roman
[2:02:12] tree in in the times of the of the Dark
[2:02:16] Ages and now it starts coming up he said
[2:02:19] still more dead forms and still more
[2:02:21] dead forms and so on and he said Dan he
[2:02:25] says it comes to this last age and he
[2:02:29] said first there's a rumor
[2:02:31] that he's alive that he's the same
[2:02:36] yesterday today and forever and this is
[2:02:40] why the Susan Street was they were a
[2:02:41] rumor they were rumor that something was
[2:02:45] happening but then he appears is
[2:02:55] appearing and where does he appear in
[2:02:57] right form
[2:02:59] hallelujah are you with me down Amen you
[2:03:02] saved brother Jim we're not a zoo so
[2:03:05] sweet no we're not the room we're the
[2:03:07] appearing and there's a difference
[2:03:09] between the rumor and the appearance
[2:03:11] I'm Adam we are here to be waived as a
[2:03:15] seat in the last day Satan Jesus Christ
[2:03:18] is the same yesterday today and forever
[2:03:21] he still filled with the Holy Ghost his
[2:03:23] power is still the same his healing is
[2:03:26] still the same his miracles is still the
[2:03:29] same his life sacred power he's still
[2:03:33] the same so like the Pentecostal
[2:03:44] experience today in the coming of the
[2:03:46] Holy Ghost in this last day as promised
[2:03:48] is like an abstract to the title deed
[2:03:52] you can get a title you can get a title
[2:03:56] to the place but that still don't say it
[2:03:59] belongs to you no sir somebody way back
[2:04:01] yonder could come and put a claim on it
[2:04:05] no sir but when you get a abstract that
[2:04:09] shows that aired that everything that
[2:04:13] was ever struck off plumb back to the
[2:04:15] foundation everything that's been
[2:04:18] against instruct all plumbing back to
[2:04:19] the foundation and when a man said that
[2:04:23] he believes the word and then when the
[2:04:28] Holy Spirit comes
[2:04:29] it is the abstract to the title now
[2:04:34] there's a lot of people going around
[2:04:36] today brother Tim we got the Holy Ghost
[2:04:38] because we believe the message no you've
[2:04:40] got that's a deed you got the title
[2:04:42] but there's still claims that's why
[2:04:45] there's still to smoke him to drink in
[2:04:47] the Papa nog Rafi the secrets inin the
[2:04:50] adulteries has all gone on in message
[2:04:52] churches are you with me
[2:04:55] I meant cuz they got a deed they
[2:04:59] believed on the Lord and they got a deed
[2:05:02] but if the death hasn't been paid and
[2:05:06] Satan's still got a claim how many how
[2:05:11] many people around the world today
[2:05:13] Satan's still got a claim on their life
[2:05:18] they claim the message I've been
[2:05:21] baptized in Jesus name I've done this
[2:05:23] I've done that but Satan's still got a
[2:05:25] claim on them there's still sin unbelief
[2:05:33] darkness hey man you say brother Tim
[2:05:40] does that mean your flesh is perfected
[2:05:43] never my flesh isn't perfected - my
[2:05:44] body's changed but what does it mean my
[2:05:48] but my flesh is broader than their
[2:05:50] subjection to the Holy Ghost and the
[2:05:57] life that I now live in the flesh I live
[2:06:00] by the faith of the Son of God who loved
[2:06:03] me and gave His life for me
[2:06:06] so when when a man who says he believes
[2:06:09] the word which is where a lot of people
[2:06:11] are and then he said when the Holy
[2:06:15] Spirit comes he gives an abstract to the
[2:06:18] title and it gives you permission when
[2:06:22] you have that abstract that ever bit of
[2:06:25] that belongs to you and everything on it
[2:06:28] belongs to you and that gives us
[2:06:31] abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[2:06:33] this title deed that God saw before the
[2:06:35] foundation of the world
[2:06:37] and put a name in the book of life but
[2:06:39] was born through a man and a woman and
[2:06:41] something to seeing and gives you sin
[2:06:43] but when I believe it when I believed on
[2:06:46] it
[2:06:46] I received the deed but when the Holy
[2:06:49] Ghost came
[2:06:50] was the abstract that everything against
[2:06:54] me whether my mother done it oh my
[2:07:00] father done it
[2:07:02] my grandmother done it like the little
[2:07:05] epileptic child I prayed for a few
[2:07:07] minutes ago that come through down
[2:07:09] through the grandparents epilepsy fell
[2:07:12] down upon the child but when the
[2:07:14] abstract has come it struck off and
[2:07:19] emitted everything and I am an abstract
[2:07:23] holder then and it sure is the spirit
[2:07:27] that raised up Christ from the dead I
[2:07:29] have an abstract deed that I'm a part of
[2:07:32] that body with the abstract of the Holy
[2:07:34] Ghost making the body of the word live
[2:07:37] out just exactly like it did in him as
[2:07:40] he promised in the last days the
[2:07:43] abstract and all my sins are struck out
[2:07:46] and all your sins are struck out about
[2:07:50] the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy
[2:07:52] Ghost has come as an abstract to the
[2:07:54] title deed that God gave me by grace by
[2:07:58] foreknowledge so he says what are you
[2:08:03] scared about no wonder he said fear not
[2:08:09] I am he that was dead and him alive
[2:08:12] again and alive forevermore and I had
[2:08:16] the keys that doesn't help don't worry
[2:08:19] about nothing even death ain't gonna
[2:08:22] hurt you amen why no fear because we're
[2:08:29] in the land with every other claim
[2:08:33] against this knocked off when the book
[2:08:36] was sealed by claims against us are you
[2:08:39] with me the Bible is our title but the
[2:08:43] Holy Ghost is our accept amen
[2:08:47] which throws out the squat when Satan
[2:08:52] like a Goliath comes on your land and
[2:08:54] claims your property the Holy Ghost is
[2:08:57] your token
[2:08:58] and then your sign that the lamb has
[2:09:02] took your place and everything against
[2:09:05] you is struck off so Goliath we're
[2:09:08] throwing you off the land hallelujah
[2:09:12] you show him your token is somebody with
[2:09:16] me I'm Anna Mattel this over and over
[2:09:19] again show him your token amen it's time
[2:09:23] to display the Holy Ghost hallelujah my

[2:09:31] Ghost when we have to sit it's time to
[2:09:35] display the token the Holy Ghost amen
[2:09:38] when we face the situation it's time to
[2:09:41] display the Holy Ghost this is a time of
[2:09:45] the Sheep wait where the bride must be
[2:09:48] on display so show him your token it's
[2:09:56] an abstract now what's this don't let
[2:10:01] your heart be troubled
[2:10:03] come on read this and read it carefully
[2:10:05] for now what fully now fully obedience
[2:10:11] to the whole Word of God entitles us to

[2:10:51] quotation full obedience to the whole
[2:10:54] Word of God to God's entire Word will
[2:10:58] entitle you this token you're even
[2:11:02] asking how am I gonna obey it all and
[2:11:04] everything have the Holy Ghost empower
[2:11:06] me and I got it you know how in the
[2:11:09] world we're gonna do this we've got
[2:11:12] attention you know Israel had to obey
[2:11:16] the message of a prophet had to take a
[2:11:20] lamb slay the lamb apply the blood get
[2:11:25] the lamb out cook the lamb with fire eat
[2:11:29] the lamb and the unleavened bread eat it
[2:11:32] with your self arrayed with your
[2:11:35] garments you stop in your hand and this
[2:11:38] entitled him to a token so that the
[2:11:41] death angel would pass over their house
[2:11:45] they had to fully obey the Word of God
[2:11:49] to be entitled to the token that was
[2:11:56] back then and that that things will was
[2:11:59] coming it's very important that we know
[2:12:00] how to do this so how do you do it
[2:12:04] here's way I'm quoting brother Branham
[2:12:07] again how do you do it Peter said on the
[2:12:10] day of Pentecost repair them for one of
[2:12:12] you and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:12:15] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[2:12:17] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:19] to token for the promises unto you and
[2:12:22] to your children and to them that's far
[2:12:24] off even as many as the Lord our God
[2:12:26] shall call so when I accept God's lamb
[2:12:30] and I completely surrender my will then
[2:12:35] I am entitled to the token get it out of
[2:12:42] your head I'm I not even a bunch of laws
[2:12:45] of do's and don'ts it's not keeping

[2:12:57] pajamas should this happen to do one
[2:12:59] thing repent
[2:13:01] surrender your will to God down to sin
[2:13:05] be buried in his name and you sigh
[2:13:08] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:13:10] entitles you to that token so everyone
[2:13:20] that will repent everyone who will
[2:13:23] surrender their life every one of them
[2:13:25] are entitled to the token are you with
[2:13:30] me now and the token there is the free
[2:13:33] pass
[2:13:34] the death angel must pass over so

[2:18:42] focus on just just you know it's new you
[2:18:46] can't be emotional can't be sensation
[2:18:48] sensations yet with it your prophet said
[2:18:50] it isn't sensation but sensations with
[2:18:54] it it's an experience and man if someone
[2:18:58] some want to do away with that so he he
[2:19:00] says it don't mean jumping down to the
[2:19:02] altar there's your sensation and they
[2:19:04] don't mean walk back there and shake
[2:19:05] hands with the pastor that's your
[2:19:07] intellectual conception people can't
[2:19:12] walk a balance
[2:19:14] they either get over here until Mosul is
[2:19:17] Ammar way over here and into
[2:19:21] intellectualism but just in case you're
[2:19:25] wondering your prophet told you it is
[2:19:27] better to err on the side of fanaticism
[2:19:31] than it is on intellectualism he said I
[2:19:38] would rather have wildfire than no
[2:19:42] fighter a man but he said it doesn't
[2:19:49] mean come down the altar and jump up and
[2:19:52] down it doesn't mean walk back there and
[2:19:55] shake hands with the pastor that made
[2:19:57] all this foolishness we've seen nothing
[2:19:58] it doesn't mean putting your name on a
[2:20:00] church but it means death to your first
[2:20:04] being like to your second being it means
[2:20:07] the blood has been applied and you're
[2:20:09] identified by the life of Jesus Christ
[2:20:11] if he'd be the fine and we'd be the
[2:20:13] branches the life that is in the branch
[2:20:16] is also from the vine he'll buy the
[2:20:18] fruit and he said when you've got to
[2:20:20] talk and it shows you of Abeid
[2:20:22] everywhere what weird or what I required
[2:20:26] repent be baptized in his name and you
[2:20:30] sigh receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:20:32] that's the obedience that entitles you
[2:20:35] to the token you say well I did that a
[2:20:39] lie I didn't get the Holy Ghost then go
[2:20:41] back and look at your repentance come on
[2:20:47] and then go back and look at make sure
[2:20:50] you surrender your whole wheel to God
[2:20:52] make sure you die doubt yourself make
[2:20:56] sure you die upon your altar that's he
[2:20:59] dad up on the cross and that you are
[2:21:02] demo fide in this depth because the
[2:21:06] problem isn't God is because there's
[2:21:09] some loose cannon in your life let me
[2:21:17] stop there just a minute
[2:21:19] there was one time a man he was called a
[2:21:24] cannoneer he was on a ship they had
[2:21:29] these big cannons you know many of them
[2:21:32] were sometimes would be on wheels
[2:21:35] depends on the ship for its protections
[2:21:38] against pirates they would be there that
[2:21:44] would have them in one position on one
[2:21:47] side of the boat but they could be wield
[2:21:50] real quickly or pretty quickly just in
[2:21:53] minutes to go face another ship on the
[2:21:56] other side but you know that wild that
[2:22:01] cannon master he had to make sure the
[2:22:05] cannon was secured because when the
[2:22:11] storms come if it got loose then that
[2:22:17] heavy several time machine the piece of
[2:22:21] equipment rolling back and forth across
[2:22:23] the deck would kill and maim N and then
[2:22:29] the storms that wasn't fastened down it
[2:22:32] could batter the sides until it broke
[2:22:35] through it was very dangerous to have a
[2:22:38] loose cannon and you've got to realize
[2:22:43] there are things in your life that God
[2:22:47] put there and they're there you know
[2:22:52] they're they're there let's just say
[2:22:53] passion for procreation it is there it's
[2:22:59] permitted by God but there's got to be
[2:23:03] tied down by the Holy Spirit somebody
[2:23:07] with me and man because there could be
[2:23:10] some trials it comes in your marriage
[2:23:12] and you you will lose maybe some of the
[2:23:17] the first sloughed that you once had and
[2:23:21] we must all work really hard to keep
[2:23:23] that first love that we have for our
[2:23:26] mates there's somebody with me but even
[2:23:28] there if you're unmarried it's got to be
[2:23:31] down by the Holy Ghost because it's
[2:23:34] going to be temptations at school
[2:23:36] there's going to be temptation as close
[2:23:38] as your cell phone and by the way
[2:23:41] looking at pornography is adultery you
[2:23:46] are guilty I'm committing adultery or
[2:23:49] fornication it's exactly right but
[2:23:53] looking upon a woman and lust sooner
[2:23:55] after in your heart it's sin and there's
[2:24:01] gonna have to be something that ties
[2:24:03] down does that canon of passion a man
[2:24:08] that can be useful in a marriage but can
[2:24:12] great being great harm to your family
[2:24:14] destruct claim caused the boat to go
[2:24:16] down divorces to happened little
[2:24:19] children's homes split up your temper
[2:24:23] your temper is another thing you know
[2:24:25] it's got to be tied down we always say
[2:24:27] about temper it's such a great thing you
[2:24:29] should never lose it without it you're
[2:24:33] spineless weakling and then you need a
[2:24:36] backbone you need a strength you need a
[2:24:38] temper but you need a channel you need
[2:24:42] to tie down a man because they're storms
[2:24:47] covered and then every one of you will
[2:24:50] face storms you'll face storms when I
[2:24:52] don't face storm but you'll face storms
[2:24:54] I will face stone and everything in your
[2:24:56] life has to be tied down this is the
[2:25:00] same concept brother man I'm talking
[2:25:01] about the train car and it being packed
[2:25:04] and inspected so that it doesn't break
[2:25:07] loose on the journey and then the seal
[2:25:09] is put on it because it must reach its
[2:25:15] destination
[2:25:18] so this wagon master or this cannon
[2:25:21] master he was neglectful about his
[2:25:24] duties a little bit slothful a little
[2:25:28] bit lazy didn't get his job done not in
[2:25:32] time the storms come and it broke loose
[2:25:36] his fellow soldiers get killed sailors
[2:25:40] get killed others remain
[2:25:42] crippled I can't walk they're in a
[2:25:46] horrible condition somebody with me and
[2:25:50] man finally the storm comes through you
[2:25:54] know and then they get it and come they
[2:25:58] get the cannon back in place but who
[2:26:02] walked the plank was the cannon master
[2:26:07] he had caused all the damage because he
[2:26:12] had neglected to tie down the canta
[2:26:14] canta
[2:26:16] and let me just tell you in your life
[2:26:18] it's the same thing we got things in our
[2:26:21] lives that has to be tied down in and
[2:26:23] anchored by the Holy Ghost and this is
[2:26:27] what the Holy Ghost does it anchors you
[2:26:29] it anchors those things in life so that
[2:26:33] when trials come when temptations come
[2:26:36] you it is chained down it doesn't move
[2:26:41] because every one of you me myself every
[2:26:45] one of us all of us are subject to
[2:26:47] temptations we're subject to trials and
[2:26:50] storms but something must hold you
[2:26:53] [Music]
[2:26:56] because if it breaks loose it causes
[2:27:00] damage to the home to the marriage to
[2:27:05] the church to your family into your God
[2:27:13] it's important the token it shows you of
[2:27:21] obeyed every word then you and the word
[2:27:25] are one and he says then you're only
[2:27:27] asking for the thing that you are
[2:27:29] because I'm of the word
[2:27:31] I am the word then I'm only asking for
[2:27:34] what belongs to me so if you say hand
[2:27:38] reach out for that handkerchief it
[2:27:42] doesn't see hand obeyed me why it's a
[2:27:46] part of me and when you and the word
[2:27:47] becomes one every promise cord to God
[2:27:50] every promises
[2:27:52] it obeys you but then you want to watch
[2:27:56] what you want to do you wouldn't put
[2:27:58] your hand in a fire just to say see me I
[2:28:00] did do it no no there's there's
[2:28:02] something in that fire I gotta reach for
[2:28:04] it it little baby that's right see you
[2:28:06] wanna watch what you do it and that's
[2:28:08] ways that Holy Spirit is given out and
[2:28:10] things sparingly give it out and things
[2:28:13] you know what I mean because you a real
[2:28:16] servant of God doesn't show up with it
[2:28:18] you see that's making a show but when we
[2:28:20] pray we present the token it shows we
[2:28:23] have fully obeyed and being baptized in
[2:28:29] this token into the body of Christ first
[2:28:31] Christmas well now we are subject to the
[2:28:34] gifts of the Spirit that's in there the
[2:28:36] world of believe in the hand gives the
[2:28:39] trench don't believe in gifts but God's
[2:28:41] Word set serious gifts and it takes only
[2:28:44] that token to act denta fie those gifts
[2:28:47] absolutely and then him is all the
[2:28:49] fullness and in him is all the fullness
[2:28:51] of God and the fullness of the promise
[2:28:53] and when we're baptizing him we have
[2:28:55] ever promised that God made they did our
[2:28:58] fingertips we've heard it enough well
[2:29:02] you don't divine healing there's a minor
[2:29:04] and you don't major on a minor well let
[2:29:07] me tell you you can't have the major
[2:29:08] without the minor if you got the full
[2:29:11] gospel and you got it all and man if the
[2:29:14] word is restored they won't brother Tim
[2:29:16] when that which is perfect is come that
[2:29:18] which is in Parkdale has done away with
[2:29:20] that's right when the perfect word comes
[2:29:22] in is just having parties done away with
[2:29:25] we're not in an age at a time but we
[2:29:28] just have part of it we have every part
[2:29:30] of the word we have every promise of the
[2:29:33] word wherever healing that scripture
[2:29:35] that's in the word come on we have ever
[2:29:37] gift in the body everything is ours
[2:29:40] because the day of having part is done
[2:29:43] away with a man even the part of being a
[2:29:49] child and jumping up and down and trying
[2:29:51] to speak into us is over with but real
[2:29:54] pain
[2:29:56] and the real Holy Ghost hangover wealth
[2:29:59] but you see what we're talking about in
[2:30:01] this day is that ecclesiastical spirit
[2:30:05] that wants to take away the moving of
[2:30:07] the Spirit and by the Holy Ghost
[2:30:10] and that's where the death angel is in
[2:30:13] the land and that's what we got a
[2:30:15] realize for churches are dying and they
[2:30:18] are closed it's not just store closes
[2:30:22] somebody help me preach now his churches
[2:30:25] that are drying up and died on the vine
[2:30:28] because they didn't go and get the Holy
[2:30:31] Ghost and the death angel is coming
[2:30:33] through with it with the doors of creeds
[2:30:36] and dogmas and sealing away and send
[2:30:38] away the movement of the Holy Ghost but
[2:30:41] it's been released back to us by the
[2:30:43] evening time message a man that the Holy
[2:30:46] Ghost is no longer bound anymore it's
[2:30:49] it's the time of freedom it's the
[2:30:51] Jubilee it's the Pentecost is the waving
[2:30:54] of the sheath it's the time to display
[2:30:56] that oh God
