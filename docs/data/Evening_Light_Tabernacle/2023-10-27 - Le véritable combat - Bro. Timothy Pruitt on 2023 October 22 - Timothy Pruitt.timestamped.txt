[56:49] you stay behind the
[56:51] word amen you put the word in front of

[56:58] place you know brother BR said it like
[57:01] this he said one day he was walking
[57:03] taking his
[57:05] daughter I I think he was taking her to
[57:08] school and he was listening to a
[57:11] broadcast and you know on this broadcast
[57:13] I was telling how
[57:15] creation just started from some ashes
[57:19] blowing a few
[57:22] chemicals and also
[57:25] you know the big bang bang I agree it
[57:28] was a big
[57:31] bang it was let there
[57:36] be it was a spoken word of God somebody
[57:39] wants to believe that
[57:41] somehow in all this
[57:44] nothingness two little tiny
[57:47] things got together and we are who we
[57:50] are
[57:51] today fa to believe
[57:53] that
[57:55] then to believe there's a there's a
[57:57] there's a Creator behind the
[58:00] creation there's a designer in
[58:03] charge and he spoke a word and he said
[58:07] let there be and when that word
[58:11] spoke took
[58:14] place I agree it was a big b it was the
[58:17] word of
[58:19] God amen amen so it was explaining how
[58:23] all this took place
[58:25] and you know he said there's no such a
[58:27] thing but Satan was trying to punch at
[58:30] me he said so after I took my little
[58:32] Rebecca to
[58:34] school I turned the radio on
[58:37] again I thought well I probably just
[58:39] getting that stuff again so I turned it
[58:42] off and as I was going up the
[58:45] street Satan said to me do you know that
[58:49] this man that you called
[58:51] Jesus he was just a man like any other
[58:53] man like a Billy Graham
[58:57] or he was just a man that they could
[58:59] begin to have a few people
[59:02] get and say he's a great man and after a
[59:06] while he became
[59:07] greater and then he become a God to them
[59:11] and now it's scattered all over the
[59:13] world and he's dead and that's
[59:17] all the prophet had mine battles
[59:21] too amen amen and I thought
[59:25] Satan how a liar you
[59:30] are Satan you that's talking to my
[59:34] conscience I want to ask you a
[59:36] few who was it that the Hebrew Prophet
[59:39] spoke of would
[59:41] come who was that anointed Messiah who
[59:45] was it that those men who foresaw
[59:48] him his life thousands of
[59:52] years he was numbered with the
[59:54] transgression
[59:55] he worth for our he made his grave with
[59:59] a rich he up on the and he promised his
[1:00:04] Holy Ghost and I've got it so you might
[1:00:07] as well get
[1:00:09] away because it's written in his word
[1:00:12] and every word is
[1:00:15] true and he
[1:00:17] left just give him the
[1:00:21] word give him the
[1:00:23] word cannot stand the
[1:00:27] word
[1:00:30] Glory Proverbs

[1:00:37] power of the
[1:00:41] tongue and they that love it shall eat
[1:00:44] the fruit
[1:00:47] thereof what the scripture is saying is
[1:00:50] that words that you
[1:00:52] speak have the ability to give
[1:00:56] life or to give

[1:01:23] will speak will either lift people
[1:01:26] higher or them lower it can Inspire the
[1:01:30] greatness or push them down to
[1:01:33] nothing life and death are in the power
[1:01:38] of Matthew 1237
[1:01:42] say says for by thy words thou shal be

[1:37:49] blessed by the preaching of the word of
[1:37:55] God you know Faith coming by
[1:37:59] hearing hearing of the word of
[1:38:04] God we didn't just hear a
[1:38:08] sermon we heard spoke of
[1:38:12] God to give us
[1:38:15] faith and when we go back
[1:38:18] home whether we from the north to south
[1:38:20] east the
[1:38:22] West we will go we will go back
[1:38:27] home
[1:38:31] Victorious brother Bram tells us the
[1:38:34] worst thing that Satan can put upon
[1:38:37] you know what it is
[1:38:43] fear but when the
[1:38:45] bride by the preaching of the word can
[1:38:49] realize her position
[1:38:53] then she is an invincible
[1:38:56] Army saints of
[1:38:58] God look in the mirror of the word of
[1:39:02] God God tells about you I have chosen
[1:39:06] you you are my precious you are my bride
[1:39:11] you are here to destroy Satan's

[1:39:34] me I know some have to take the
[1:39:38] road but you know we have been greatly
[1:39:43] blessed that's because the meetings were
