[13:25] coach this thing just kind of wore out a
[13:27] little bit but we got another one coming
[13:30] and by the way even what you're wearing
[13:32] won't work there you're going to have to

[13:44] the adults we love them to be in the
[13:47] back in this meeting this is your about
[13:50] you and about your meeting and uh you
[13:53] know it makes it a little hard for you I
[13:55] know but we don't allow the savings of
[13:58] seeds so you know come come and occupy a
[14:01] seat that way every everything kind of
[14:04] gets treated fairly and whatever and of
[14:06] course you know we have to talk about a
[14:09] few rules and I myself think it's a
[14:13] disrespectful to chew gum in church and
[14:16] you know uh uh I I think you know if you
[14:20] are here you ought to be attentive to
[14:23] the word of God and and also be
[14:25] respectful to the house of God and and I
[14:29] I just want to tell you you're the
[14:32] greatest group of young people on the
[14:35] face of the Earth
[14:37] and you have my heart and I love you
[14:39] with all my heart and I appreciate each
[14:42] one of you your testimony for the Lord
[14:45] and and your Zeal for him and your
[14:48] desire to serve him and and you're the
[14:51] best of the best and I I tell you that
[14:54] that's the truth every time I get a
[14:56] report
[14:58] um I even got a call today from another
[15:00] camp that we had in in Texas there for a
[15:03] while and said you were our favorite
[15:05] group that we ever had there's something
[15:07] about believers
[15:09] amen we we we have an atmosphere about
[15:12] us and that atmosphere
[15:15] um changes those that around us and it
[15:18] brings a wonderful feeling of peace and
[15:20] and joy and uh so you know just having
[15:23] you together with us this weekend gives
[15:26] us a chance to share together and enjoy
[15:29] in the great things of God and and feed
[15:32] off of
[15:33] one another create an atmosphere you
[15:36] know around us for somebody else that
[15:38] can receive something from God and just
[15:41] think you know if you misbehave in
[15:43] church and you cause somebody else to uh
[15:46] miss their blessing and their
[15:48] opportunity well you said well it ain't
[15:51] for me well what if it's for the person
[15:53] next to you so you know be respectful
[15:56] and and uh do your part to pull on the
[15:58] word of God and and and just

[24:23] care of we're just glad you're here
[24:26] and we want to invite the Lord to be
[24:28] here
[24:29] we want him in this camp meeting with
[24:32] you know we could go through all of this
[24:34] and if he didn't come
[24:37] it wouldn't be worth it
[24:39] what we've come for so I want you to
[24:41] stand together with me tonight
[24:43] and I want you to ask God
[24:46] to come by your way
[24:47] to speak to your heart to deal with you
[24:50] to come by your pew
[24:53] to deal with you in a very special way
[24:57] God wants to make himself real to you
[25:01] I remember some years ago
[25:04] somewhere about right in here
[25:08] there was a stage all the way across the
[25:10] auditorium was back this way a gymnasium
[25:12] on that side
[25:14] when Hurricane Rita come through knocked
[25:16] a bunch of trees down they turned this
[25:18] one thing into a big Auditorium and put
[25:20] the cut the lumber up and put it on the
[25:22] walls made a beautiful Auditorium
[25:26] we'd had a prayer line
[25:28] it was doors there on each side of the
[25:30] stage where
[25:32] where would enter into the the gym area
[25:40] without a prayer line and I'd prayed for
[25:42] about 400.
[25:45] and I after praying for hours for
[25:48] different needs
[25:50] I was really exhausted
[25:52] just catching my breath looked out over
[25:54] the congregation
[25:56] most of them was all gone
[25:59] I thought God what in the world has
[26:01] happened
[26:02] who dismissed young people are they all
[26:04] at it the Snack Shack and everything
[26:07] where were they at
[26:10] someone tapped me on the shoulders one
[26:12] that he can said come look
[26:14] and out over here on this side kneeling
[26:17] everywhere across
[26:19] was young people
[26:21] gathered around each other and praying
[26:23] and
[26:24] calling out on God and I walked by and
[26:26] hear a young person said it's real it's
[26:29] real
[26:30] it's real I've always heard about it
[26:33] but I've experienced it for myself
[26:36] God's real
[26:39] listen
[26:40] he's real
[26:41] he'll change your life
[26:44] in a moment
[26:45] you will never be the same when he
[26:48] touches your life
[26:53] the life you've known here before
[26:56] is nothing compared to the life you'll
[26:58] live walking with him
[27:01] changes you forever in his presence
[27:04] make something out of you that the world
[27:06] cannot make out of you
[27:09] what do they have to offer the dope the
[27:12] crime the wine the women the men the
[27:15] whatever
[27:16] that's all they have to offer
[27:19] we have something to offer
[27:21] to make a real lady out of you a real
[27:24] man out of you
[27:25] make me bring forth real real children
[27:29] real young people
[27:31] things that you would desire that's what
[27:33] we have on this side
[27:35] but we have more than that
[27:39] we have reservations for a new body
[27:42] for a house not made with hams
[27:45] that's Eternal in the heavens
[27:48] we have a place that we're going to go
[27:50] when all the World falls apart
[27:53] and the world has fallen apart all
[27:55] around you

[59:47] able to
[59:48] speak of our lovely Lord and his word
[59:51] the great things that he has done is
[59:54] doing and is going to do I know it's the
[59:57] first night you're probably tired you've
[59:59] traveled but let's look into the word a
[1:00:02] little bit
[1:00:04] um turn with them if you would Romans
[1:00:05] chapter 4 verse 17.
[1:00:10] certainly agree each of you all the
[1:00:12] ministers that were here so appreciate
[1:00:14] mother Tam once again having this camp
[1:00:17] for the use
[1:00:19] so appreciate the other ministers that
[1:00:20] will be speaking brother Ron with Andrew
[1:00:22] looking forward to that what the Lord
[1:00:25] has given them for these times that
[1:00:28] we're together
[1:00:30] I want to speak to you tonight on facts
[1:00:34] versus truth
[1:00:38] facts
[1:00:39] verses
[1:00:41] truce
[1:00:42] now you may think they're the same thing
[1:00:45] but actually sometimes they're not
[1:00:49] I've been listening to a song the last
[1:00:52] six seven months something like that
[1:00:54] and it deals with this about sometimes
[1:00:58] the facts can be stacked up against you
[1:01:02] but the truth is God's on your side
[1:01:06] brother Aaron Oglesby was up with us
[1:01:08] last Sunday and he touched on this same
[1:01:12] thing let me read to you what the word
[1:01:14] fact actually means
[1:01:16] a piece of information
[1:01:20] about circumstances that exist or events
[1:01:25] that have occurred
[1:01:27] let me read to you again a piece
[1:01:30] of information
[1:01:32] not the entire scope of the information
[1:01:34] but a piece of the information about
[1:01:39] circumstances that exist or events that
[1:01:44] have occurred Romans chapter 4 verse 17.
[1:01:51] as it is written
[1:01:52] I have made thee a father
[1:01:55] of many nations before him who he
[1:01:59] believed now this of course speaking of
[1:02:00] Abraham and the promise that God had
[1:02:04] made to Abraham which is our father
[1:02:07] who quickened the Dead
[1:02:09] and call us those things which be not
[1:02:14] as though they were
[1:02:18] so he calls things that were not
[1:02:20] actually in existence yet
[1:02:23] but he called them address them
[1:02:27] spoke to them and dealt with them as if
[1:02:31] though they were already there
[1:02:33] now listen to verse 18. who against hope
[1:02:38] believed in Hope
[1:02:40] that he might become the father of many
[1:02:42] nations
[1:02:44] according to that which was spoken so
[1:02:48] shall thy seed be
[1:02:50] and being not weak in faith
[1:02:55] he considered not now these are the
[1:02:58] facts that will get you in trouble
[1:03:01] he considered not his own body
[1:03:05] now dead
[1:03:07] so it was a fact
[1:03:09] his body was now dead
[1:03:12] here's another fact
[1:03:14] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:03:18] another fact
[1:03:19] neither yet the deadness
[1:03:22] of Sarah's womb
[1:03:24] so now these are facts
[1:03:27] but he believes something different
[1:03:30] [Applause]
[1:03:32] notice in verse 20 he staggered not at
[1:03:35] the promise of God through unbelief but
[1:03:37] were strong in faith giving glory to God
[1:03:42] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:03:45] had promised
[1:03:47] he was able also to perform are there
[1:03:49] any of his children here tonight that
[1:03:51] believe the same thing
[1:03:53] [Applause]
[1:03:54] verse 22.
[1:03:56] and therefore
[1:03:58] it was imputed
[1:04:02] to him
[1:04:03] for righteousness
[1:04:05] now because he believed God this way God
[1:04:09] imputed this face to this man
[1:04:14] for righteousness which is right
[1:04:16] standing with God
[1:04:20] I mean a lot to be remembered tonight as
[1:04:21] we pray just raise your hand there
[1:04:23] before the Lord
[1:04:25] heavenly father is we
[1:04:28] begin these days together
[1:04:31] we are so thankful Lord for the
[1:04:34] opportunity
[1:04:35] we're expecting you Lord to come and do
[1:04:39] what you always do
[1:04:41] heal the sick Save The Lost fill with
[1:04:44] the Holy Ghost set the captive free cast
[1:04:48] out evil spirits
[1:04:50] that's what we're used to seeing you do
[1:04:54] and we believe the father in these days
[1:04:56] that we're together that you are going
[1:04:58] to do it once more
[1:05:01] it is our expectation that you will meet
[1:05:04] with us and once again there will be
[1:05:07] lives that will be changed and
[1:05:10] transformed
[1:05:11] speak to us tonight father in this
[1:05:14] beginning service help me Lord that I
[1:05:16] can be sensitive to the spirit of God
[1:05:18] lead me down the direction of the needs
[1:05:21] of these people
[1:05:23] you're the only one that can custom fit
[1:05:25] a sermon that would be able to go to
[1:05:28] Every Hungry Heart and no doubt we're
[1:05:31] only seeing a small portion of those who
[1:05:35] are hearing tonight those that have will
[1:05:38] be streaming and those that will go back
[1:05:40] so Lord the audience is vast and the
[1:05:43] needs are many but your power is so
[1:05:46] great
[1:05:48] to us and not father in the name of the
[1:05:51] Lord Jesus we ask him
[1:05:52] and the Saints said
[1:05:56] sure do you do a bad Mac ain't you
[1:06:00] ah there you go God bless you can be
[1:06:03] seated
[1:06:10] I'm sure all of us have heard it said
[1:06:13] that the devil
[1:06:15] cannot tell the truth
[1:06:18] but in reality that's not the truth
[1:06:22] because the devil can tell the truth
[1:06:26] when it's to his advantage
[1:06:29] and he will actually use truth
[1:06:34] and facts against us
[1:06:38] if we will allow him to
[1:06:41] you know facts are something that we as
[1:06:45] the people of God our faith is based
[1:06:48] upon facts it's based upon truths but
[1:06:52] sometimes our enemy will take certain
[1:06:57] facts and blend them in and misrepresent
[1:07:02] them in order to defeat us
[1:07:05] I want you to think just a minute might
[1:07:07] take a few minutes to catch this thought
[1:07:09] but what does Satan use against many of
[1:07:13] us in order to get us discouraged
[1:07:16] our failures our weaknesses
[1:07:20] is there are those facts
[1:07:22] and he will say well you've done this
[1:07:25] and you've done that why even go to that
[1:07:28] Youth Camp how many have you been to and
[1:07:31] you left you didn't get what you thought
[1:07:34] other people said they got this and that
[1:07:37] and the other they run and they jumped
[1:07:39] and they hollered and you was just as
[1:07:42] sincere as they were and you went there
[1:07:45] with needs of your life and yet you left
[1:07:48] and you were so disappointed
[1:07:50] knowledge that the fact for some of you
[1:07:53] it probably is
[1:07:55] so he will try to accumulate those facts
[1:08:00] and convince you that why should you
[1:08:03] even go well you've already put forth
[1:08:06] the effort and you're here tonight oh
[1:08:09] yeah he said well there's no need for
[1:08:11] you to really get in it'll be like it's
[1:08:13] been before no doubt there's some of you
[1:08:16] sitting here tonight and the facts are
[1:08:19] you have addictions in your life
[1:08:23] no doubt there's some of you sitting
[1:08:25] here tonight and you have problems with
[1:08:28] pornography
[1:08:29] you have problems with besetting sins
[1:08:33] and the facts are sure
[1:08:36] and Satan will use them against you
[1:08:41] but the truth is Jesus loves you
[1:08:45] the truth is you can be delivered from
[1:08:49] every one of those problems that you
[1:08:52] have
[1:08:54] now I'm not sure tonight to tell you
[1:08:56] that some of those facts do not exist
[1:08:59] you know Abraham did not say he was not
[1:09:03] an old man Abraham did not say Sarah was
[1:09:07] not an old woman Abraham did not say his
[1:09:10] body was not dead he did not say Sarah's
[1:09:15] womb was not dead but what he refused to
[1:09:17] say was that those present circumstances
[1:09:21] was going to keep God's promise from
[1:09:24] coming to pass in their life
[1:09:28] you realize that God's word is so
[1:09:30] profound and the prophet said it over
[1:09:33] and over again that the Lord Jesus is
[1:09:36] the high priest of our confession and
[1:09:39] that he can only do for us in heaven as
[1:09:42] we say on the earth that he's already
[1:09:46] done it for us so if the devil can keep
[1:09:49] us down in the mouth and all weary and
[1:09:53] all warning you look at your defeats and
[1:09:55] you look at your past failures and you
[1:09:58] say well that's probably who I'll be all
[1:10:00] in my life I'll agree with you until you
[1:10:03] get to a spot that you can get above
[1:10:06] your failures and above your past and
[1:10:10] above all your shortcomings the prophet
[1:10:13] said you will never live any higher than
[1:10:16] you confess that you are
[1:10:19] somebody say Amen so you see the devil
[1:10:23] will try to accumulate all of those
[1:10:25] things that he calls as facts and say
[1:10:29] you might as well just go ahead and
[1:10:31] admit it you will never be an overcoming
[1:10:34] Christian you'll always be one of those
[1:10:36] around the message that just makes it
[1:10:39] from one Youth Camp to another well no
[1:10:42] doubt there are some people and they
[1:10:45] will be those type of people but that
[1:10:47] will be up to you whether or not you
[1:10:49] want to be that way if you don't want to
[1:10:53] live from one youth meeting to another
[1:10:55] and from one use banquet to another then
[1:10:58] there's nothing in God's word that says
[1:11:01] you have to unless you will accept less
[1:11:05] than what God has for you tonight I
[1:11:08] believe that the prophet of God tells us
[1:11:11] a man or woman can live so completely
[1:11:14] surrendered to God that the devil don't
[1:11:17] know what to do with again
[1:11:20] oh can you imagine that you get up every
[1:11:23] morning and you don't shake and tremble
[1:11:26] but when you get up young person and you
[1:11:29] set your foot down on the floor and the
[1:11:31] devil says oh no here he comes again oh
[1:11:36] no here she comes again another child of
[1:11:40] God another young person filled with the
[1:11:42] Holy Ghost another young person that
[1:11:45] believes God's word
[1:11:49] I heard about the Tim getting a little
[1:11:51] of his testimony there about how he was
[1:11:54] saved as a young man don't you admire
[1:11:56] God doing something like that in our
[1:11:58] brother's life keeping him through all
[1:12:00] of these years I too was saved as a
[1:12:03] young man given my heart to the Lord
[1:12:05] when I was 12. started to preach when I
[1:12:08] was 18. been pastoring for over 40 years
[1:12:12] now I'm 67 in a few months and yet I've
[1:12:16] got a greater determination tonight than
[1:12:18] I had it when I was 12. I've got a
[1:12:21] greater determination tonight to stand
[1:12:23] for the truth and preach the word but
[1:12:25] brother Donnie you're an old man don't
[1:12:27] tell me that I don't know it yet I'm
[1:12:30] still acting like I'm a young man I'm
[1:12:32] still behaving like I'm a young man and
[1:12:35] as a matter of fact I'm more threat to
[1:12:37] Hell tonight than I was when I was 20.
[1:12:41] I'm more threat to Hell tonight than I
[1:12:44] was when I was 40. now you realize it
[1:12:47] depends on what you and I want to be
[1:12:50] it's not just what Satan dictates and
[1:12:53] says well you'll never be this and
[1:12:55] you'll never be that whose report are we
[1:12:58] going to believe are we going to believe
[1:13:00] what the devil says or are we going to
[1:13:02] believe what God says well the facts may
[1:13:06] be stacked up against you tonight but
[1:13:08] let me tell you something Jesus is here
[1:13:10] he's already here on the very first
[1:13:13] night don't wait till tomorrow night
[1:13:14] don't wait till tomorrow morning why not
[1:13:17] get set free right here tonight why not
[1:13:20] get filled with the Holy Ghost right
[1:13:22] here tonight but for the dawn of the
[1:13:24] fact shall against me they might be but
[1:13:27] all the facts do not change God's word
[1:13:30] that he used to say yesterday today and
[1:13:33] forever greater is he that is in you
[1:13:36] than he that is in the world that's
[1:13:38] God's truth
[1:13:45] let's use a few Bible characters here if
[1:13:48] we can tonight
[1:13:49] in the days of Noah
[1:13:52] the facts are it never had rained
[1:13:56] you Louisiana folks you find that hard
[1:13:59] to believe right those of you that come
[1:14:01] to youth can't find it hard to believe
[1:14:03] but yet it never had rained before how
[1:14:07] peculiar and strange that it must have
[1:14:09] been when this man stands out and
[1:14:12] preaches against the facts now think of
[1:14:14] that they had never seen rain clouds
[1:14:18] they had never heard thunder they had
[1:14:21] never seen lightning
[1:14:24] and God introduces a word to Noah that
[1:14:29] had never been said before
[1:14:31] and that was the word rain
[1:14:34] now you imagine when he got up and
[1:14:36] started preaching that it's going to
[1:14:38] rain and there's coming a flood God
[1:14:40] changed this man's vocabulary
[1:14:43] and they must have said brain what is
[1:14:46] rain well it's going to come a rain that
[1:14:49] it's going to come afloat flood what is
[1:14:51] a flood well we have no proof it's ever
[1:14:54] rained before and it hadn't it had never
[1:14:57] there's never been the clouds that
[1:14:59] gathered together because God had so
[1:15:02] designed the Earth that the Earth had
[1:15:04] its own watering system built in the
[1:15:07] soil itself notice in Genesis 2 5 and
[1:15:12] every plant of the field before that was
[1:15:14] in the earth and every herb of the field
[1:15:16] before it grew for the Lord God had not
[1:15:19] caused it to rain upon the Earth and
[1:15:22] there was no man to till the ground and
[1:15:25] there went up amidst from the earth so
[1:15:28] God irrigated the Earth with a Mist so
[1:15:32] when the earth started getting a little
[1:15:34] bit dry God just turned the irrigation
[1:15:36] pipes on and the myths come upon the
[1:15:39] earth and the whole thing was watered
[1:15:41] everywhere and yet God God started
[1:15:44] telling this man but it's going to rain
[1:15:47] imagine no I said Lord what you say
[1:15:49] right what in the world is rain I've
[1:15:52] never even heard of rain before well let
[1:15:54] me explain it to you know how it works
[1:15:55] actually the moisture and the
[1:15:57] precipitation will drop down from the
[1:15:59] heavens and see them coming from the
[1:16:01] earth up oh Lord how can that be I've
[1:16:03] never even seen that happen for it well
[1:16:05] no it's like this when I divided the
[1:16:07] waters from the waters I pulled a great
[1:16:10] vaporous canopy over the top of the
[1:16:13] earth it's held up by moisture and
[1:16:15] humidity high pressure and low pressure
[1:16:17] and so on I have kept a high pressure
[1:16:20] over the Earth since the day that I made
[1:16:23] it but I'm fixing to allow a low
[1:16:25] pressure to come in in order for the
[1:16:27] cumulus clouds to be able to build and
[1:16:29] the water vapor will start forming on
[1:16:31] the earth and then it'll start dropping
[1:16:33] down I know itself what a miraculous
[1:16:35] thing lord well I never even heard of it
[1:16:37] before the facts were it never had rain
[1:16:40] the facts were there were no clouds the
[1:16:44] facts were that there never been any
[1:16:46] lightning or it is under but the truth
[1:16:49] said it's going to rain
[1:16:51] now you imagine you could have missed
[1:16:53] church for 45 years and stay out of
[1:16:56] church for 45 years and one day you
[1:16:59] decide I'm going back to Hero Pastor
[1:17:01] Noah well you know what the last sermon
[1:17:03] that he preached when you was there he
[1:17:05] was preaching about rain well this time
[1:17:07] you come back after 45 years and Noah
[1:17:10] gets up and said glory to God I'll tell
[1:17:12] you one thing I was out praying this
[1:17:14] morning and I heard them birds of Sinner
[1:17:16] I looked up there and I saw them
[1:17:18] beautiful scars and I thought how
[1:17:20] wonderful it was it was such an awesome
[1:17:22] day and then I got to thinking it's
[1:17:24] gonna rain and they say Lord have mercy
[1:17:27] I ain't been to church in 45 years and
[1:17:29] he's preaching the same thing again
[1:17:31] that's right because that was the
[1:17:33] message of the hour don't get tired of
[1:17:36] your pastor preaching about the seven
[1:17:38] things don't get tired of your
[1:17:40] literature preaching about the Seven
[1:17:42] Seals and the Seven searches this is our
[1:17:46] nation this is our time I'm just assured
[1:17:50] I said hey there are young people
[1:17:53] sitting in this place tonight that are
[1:17:55] going to be raptured in a moment in a
[1:17:58] twinkling of an eye by the power of God
[1:18:07] so the facts
[1:18:09] said it never had been it couldn't be
[1:18:11] but the truth is Genesis 7 11. and the
[1:18:17] 600th year of Noah's life in the second
[1:18:19] month the 17th day of the month
[1:18:23] the same day were all The Fountains of
[1:18:26] the great deep
[1:18:28] you see in France the water didn't just
[1:18:30] come from up here
[1:18:32] to come from down here the aquifers that
[1:18:35] are in the ground God released above and
[1:18:39] God released beneath so the aquifers in
[1:18:43] the ground began to ooze where all this
[1:18:47] was coming out in the nice form of a
[1:18:49] mist
[1:18:50] and they started exploding the aquifers
[1:18:54] from the ground and they started pouring
[1:18:56] out from the heavens The Fountains of
[1:18:59] the deep broken up and the windows of
[1:19:03] Heaven
[1:19:04] were open and the rain
[1:19:07] the rain the word that had never been
[1:19:10] spoken yet was now made manifest
[1:19:15] so facts verse faith and face one out
[1:19:23] you understand
[1:19:24] now let's let's think about the man that
[1:19:27] we read about here in the Book of Romans
[1:19:29] chapter four Abraham and we all are
[1:19:32] familiar with his life and what a great
[1:19:34] man that he was I can't wait to meet him
[1:19:36] myself I know so many Avenues to Face by
[1:19:40] which God projected his word to this man
[1:19:42] but we're all familiar with the one
[1:19:44] about Isaac that God had promised he was
[1:19:47] going to have a son and be a father of
[1:19:49] many nations now the facts were Abraham
[1:19:53] was too old
[1:19:55] another fact was Sarah was too old
[1:19:59] another fact was his manhood was gone
[1:20:04] Sarah's ability to conceive was God her
[1:20:09] heart could not take childbirth her
[1:20:13] blood pressure could not deal with
[1:20:15] childbirth her milk veins were dried up
[1:20:18] what am I quoting to you facts
[1:20:27] facts
[1:20:29] neither of them have the nerves
[1:20:33] to deal with a newborn baby
[1:20:37] can you imagine a hundred year old man
[1:20:39] and a 90 year old woman getting up with
[1:20:41] a baby squalling and screaming and
[1:20:43] changing his diaper all night long and
[1:20:45] it getting its days and nights all mixed
[1:20:47] up and getting a colic and getting
[1:20:49] everything else today no way in the
[1:20:51] world they've gotten and the nurse a
[1:20:54] deal with a newborn
[1:20:56] another Homer Longoria said he loves to
[1:20:59] see the headlights whenever his his kids
[1:21:02] is bringing them grandchildren to see
[1:21:04] him but he also loved to see the tail
[1:21:06] lights as good as going back out the
[1:21:08] driveway
[1:21:09] well that's the way it is when your
[1:21:11] grandparents and you've got them
[1:21:12] grandchildren and they're so crying one
[1:21:15] reason they're crying is because mama
[1:21:17] daddy can take them back home
[1:21:20] so you imagine this man and woman and
[1:21:22] the devil was pointing to every one of
[1:21:25] these facts be sensible man there's no
[1:21:28] way you can father a child there's no
[1:21:30] way this woman could give birth to a
[1:21:32] child face the facts
[1:21:36] that's what he wants to tell you
[1:21:39] that's what he wants to tell you face
[1:21:42] the fact that's what he wants to tell my
[1:21:45] daughter face to facts Erica she's not
[1:21:48] facing the fact she's looking at God's
[1:21:50] promise
[1:21:52] Hallelujah that the doctor say this one
[1:21:56] said that one said I don't care what
[1:21:58] they say I want to know what does God
[1:22:02] say
[1:22:04] Max versus truth
[1:22:15] and Abraham was a hundred years old
[1:22:18] when his son Isaac was born unto him
[1:22:23] and Sarah said God
[1:22:26] has made me to laugh so all that here
[1:22:29] will life with me amen amen and she said
[1:22:32] who would have said unto Abraham that
[1:22:35] Sarah could have get children suck for I
[1:22:38] have borne him a son
[1:22:40] in his old days I want you to notice how
[1:22:42] the Bible identifies this Moses did not
[1:22:45] quote her a son I've given him a son and
[1:22:47] his old body
[1:22:51] but he says his old age
[1:22:55] you see Satan loves to take the facts
[1:23:00] and use them against him remember
[1:23:01] brother Brandon was standing there at
[1:23:03] the funeral of his wife and his wife
[1:23:05] laying in the casket and the devil
[1:23:07] started whispering to him and he said
[1:23:09] everything he told me was the truth
[1:23:19] not long ago when we were working on our
[1:23:22] church I stopped at a little store to
[1:23:23] get me some breakfast and I walked into
[1:23:24] a place there
[1:23:26] the manager was sitting there
[1:23:29] and she was shaken and quivering crying
[1:23:33] I said man you okay
[1:23:35] she said
[1:23:36] I have seizures
[1:23:38] she's just sitting there crying and
[1:23:40] shaking
[1:23:41] so I thought Lord
[1:23:43] I'm gonna offer to pray for us I said
[1:23:45] you mind if I pray for you
[1:23:47] she said no please
[1:23:50] it's all laid my hands on her you mean
[1:23:52] you wasn't ashamed of the public place
[1:23:54] good new snow might be time for Jesus to
[1:23:57] manifest himself in the public place
[1:24:00] so I laid my hand on her and prayed for
[1:24:03] it in a few minutes I noticed she
[1:24:05] stopped crying she stopped shaking she
[1:24:08] got up out of her chair smiling thank me
[1:24:12] as I left
[1:24:14] that was a wonderful thing
[1:24:16] but before I got to church that morning
[1:24:19] got down the road just a mile or so to
[1:24:21] work don't you know that devil come
[1:24:24] right in my vehicle me brother Ron and
[1:24:26] said uh-huh
[1:24:28] now he heard you praying for that woman
[1:24:31] which had bob hair
[1:24:34] makeup on and pass
[1:24:37] and how many times have you prayed for
[1:24:39] your daughter
[1:24:41] she's still sick
[1:24:43] [Music]
[1:24:45] what did he tell me a fact
[1:24:50] come on Sheldon you think he ain't told
[1:24:52] that man the same thing how many people
[1:24:55] have you prayed for him look at you and
[1:24:57] said fights yeah but it ain't all the
[1:25:00] truth it's only a piece of the
[1:25:04] unfoldation
[1:25:05] [Applause]
[1:25:19] thank you
[1:25:24] you imagine Moses and the children of
[1:25:26] Israel as they come to the Red Sea
[1:25:31] him looking around
[1:25:33] I'm thinking Lord what in the world
[1:25:36] have you done to us now
[1:25:38] where are we gonna go
[1:25:41] oh God didn't exactly tell him what was
[1:25:45] going to happen
[1:25:47] God lets him get right up to it and then
[1:25:49] Moses cries out and God said why are you
[1:25:51] crying
[1:25:57] what you want me to say
[1:26:00] speak what
[1:26:02] well let's look at some facts
[1:26:05] the sea had never rolled back and stood
[1:26:09] up before
[1:26:13] this sea had never obeyed a man's voice
[1:26:18] before
[1:26:20] facts
[1:26:21] facts
[1:26:25] it would be totally
[1:26:27] unscientific to believe such a thing
[1:26:30] could even happen
[1:26:33] well come on now
[1:26:36] no one had ever walked on the sea floor
[1:26:44] had not walked on the sea floor being
[1:26:47] totally dry
[1:26:51] fact after fact after fact
[1:26:56] oh but here's the truth
[1:26:58] Exodus 14 21 and Moses stretched out his
[1:27:02] hand over the sea and the Lord closed
[1:27:05] the sea to go back by a strong East Wind
[1:27:08] all that night I made the sea dry land
[1:27:15] and the waters were divided and the
[1:27:19] children of Israel went into the midst
[1:27:22] of the sea
[1:27:23] upon the dry ground so now are we going
[1:27:26] to believe Fox
[1:27:28] are they going to believe this
[1:27:34] now historically all concept are nods
[1:27:36] are heavy yep yep that's right I believe
[1:27:38] it I believe it but what do you believe
[1:27:40] when You Face these same things
[1:27:41] [Applause]
[1:27:44] it's easy to amen a past Victory it's
[1:27:48] not so easy to amen a present storm oh
[1:27:51] my goodness praise the Lord let me say
[1:27:54] that again it is easy to amen a past
[1:27:58] Victory oh yes sir I believe that I
[1:28:01] believe that but we find it much harder
[1:28:03] to amen so be it Lord You're gonna bring
[1:28:06] it to pass with a right in the middle of
[1:28:08] a storm
[1:28:09] anybody ever been there anybody maybe
[1:28:12] you're there tonight and you don't know
[1:28:14] which way to go you don't know which
[1:28:15] direction to turn but just remember the
[1:28:18] same Lord God that led Moses and the
[1:28:21] children of Israel through their Red Sea
[1:28:23] he will part the waters for you my
[1:28:25] brother he will park the waters for you
[1:28:27] my sister because he loves you just as
[1:28:31] much as he loves them so what would it
[1:28:34] be facts or truce
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:39] so the doctors may tell you if you stop
[1:28:42] taking your insulin
[1:28:44] you will go into a coma
[1:28:46] and you will never come out again
[1:28:51] right but all of a sudden a revelation
[1:28:54] drops down inside of your heart that you
[1:28:57] don't need it no more
[1:28:58] and what does it do then Truth Versus
[1:29:01] facts and Truth overcomes
[1:29:04] [Applause]
[1:29:07] that's a discouraging saying when you go
[1:29:09] to a doctor and they show you a scan and
[1:29:11] say you know Mr Miss whoever you are
[1:29:13] that thing is is it's in your brain it's
[1:29:16] in your liver it's in your lung and
[1:29:18] what's the human reaction the natural
[1:29:20] human reaction for most people is to
[1:29:22] fear unsaints and loves to use the fact
[1:29:26] of fear the fact of trauma the fact of
[1:29:30] oh this one's in my family my
[1:29:32] grandfather had that my father had that
[1:29:35] oh oh goodness I guess I'm going to die
[1:29:37] with that well that may be the facts as
[1:29:40] far as the facts go but God may want to
[1:29:42] break that cycle with you
[1:29:46] just because your daddy died with it and
[1:29:49] your uncle died with it that don't mean
[1:29:51] God wants you to die with it he may want
[1:29:54] to break that cycle with you and say it
[1:29:57] stops right here
[1:30:05] Hallelujah can you imagine a man
[1:30:09] General Joshua
[1:30:13] he's given a commission by God to take
[1:30:16] the people of the Lord into their
[1:30:19] inheritance
[1:30:21] it's written and so it says rather than
[1:30:23] history that they're about 28 years
[1:30:26] covering the Span in order to take the
[1:30:29] land Joshua is getting old and he tells
[1:30:31] them there's still much more land to be
[1:30:34] possessed why were you awake come on in
[1:30:36] take the land
[1:30:38] but this is in the initial stage to
[1:30:41] where they're going up to the great city
[1:30:43] of Jericho it's in the Southland
[1:30:46] directly across the Jordan it's the
[1:30:48] first city they must take big gigantic
[1:30:51] walls able to have chariot races across
[1:30:54] the top of them uh to some historians
[1:30:57] say for the breast so you can imagine
[1:30:58] how big those walls would have been so
[1:31:02] and God gives him now the tactic or the
[1:31:06] means by which he's going to take this
[1:31:07] city
[1:31:09] now what he's going to do they're going
[1:31:11] to March around the city one time every
[1:31:13] day until the seventh day and when
[1:31:16] they're out there they can't talk they
[1:31:19] can't joke they can't laugh they can't
[1:31:22] say anything they just March around the
[1:31:24] wall and then they go back they come
[1:31:27] back the next day they March around the
[1:31:29] wall and they go back
[1:31:34] now would you ever believe marching and
[1:31:36] shouting will take down a wall that bit
[1:31:42] well now the fact says there's never
[1:31:44] been a wall before in history ever
[1:31:46] flattened down by marching and shouting
[1:31:49] praise the Lord
[1:31:51] this was totally again unscientific and
[1:31:56] now it was not even reasonable what
[1:31:59] person in the right mind could think
[1:32:01] they could March around the city then on
[1:32:04] the seventh day the priests will blow
[1:32:06] the horn down the Levi shall be carrying
[1:32:08] the word and then whenever they come
[1:32:10] around the seventh time because on the
[1:32:12] seventh day all seven seals are open
[1:32:15] Hallelujah so on the seventh day when
[1:32:18] all seven seals are open then they're
[1:32:21] not looking well this is not very
[1:32:23] scientific this has never been done
[1:32:25] before has anybody looked to see if we
[1:32:27] have any Scripture to back this up they
[1:32:29] had not one scripture they had not known
[1:32:32] not one previous record in the history
[1:32:35] of Israel or any other Nation where
[1:32:37] anybody had ever marched around that
[1:32:40] wall often let me tell you something
[1:32:42] people say oh well I'm just going to be
[1:32:44] another statistic well why would you
[1:32:46] want to be why would you want to just
[1:32:48] succumb to the devil and not fight for
[1:32:51] everything that belongs to you as a
[1:32:53] child of God
[1:32:55] hey
[1:32:57] but the truth is Joshua 6 20.
[1:33:02] so the people shouted
[1:33:05] when the priest blew with the trumpets
[1:33:07] and it came to pass when the people
[1:33:10] heard the sound of the trumpet and the
[1:33:14] people got real quiet and the people sat
[1:33:17] there and held their peace
[1:33:20] [Applause]
[1:33:22] and nodded their heads
[1:33:25] I saw a lot of us message folks do
[1:33:30] well we're not earth ain't we we nod off
[1:33:33] to sleep and we nod off to sleep and we
[1:33:36] nod off amen can you imagine brother
[1:33:38] Brandon whenever he'd send his old dog
[1:33:40] friends he said he hated a skunk but
[1:33:43] yeah brother Brandon would send old
[1:33:44] friends in on a skunk and you'll imagine
[1:33:46] that brother venomous said whenever you
[1:33:48] take them up there what skunk was and
[1:33:50] brother random would have went
[1:33:54] no Fritz to look back and said you mean
[1:33:56] that's all you got
[1:33:57] you mean you expect me to go in there
[1:33:59] and grab a hold of that guy he's going
[1:34:01] to make me smell like a pole cat ain't
[1:34:03] nobody want to be around me and that's
[1:34:05] all you got a little nod I'll tell you
[1:34:08] one thing some of you all ought to do
[1:34:09] better at home it ain't just enough to
[1:34:12] scream and holler to use Camp you ought
[1:34:14] to get behind your poor little Pastor
[1:34:16] when you go home don't just call her
[1:34:18] here but when you go home take that
[1:34:21] hollering back with you stand up and say
[1:34:23] come on man of God go ahead get that
[1:34:26] devil go ahead and get it well for the
[1:34:29] daughter he shall use him no but show
[1:34:31] your pastor once you've got it you can
[1:34:34] take your joy back home take your
[1:34:37] emotion back home with you
[1:34:40] Hallelujah
[1:34:48] so the people heard the trumpet the
[1:34:50] watch it's all synchronized together
[1:34:51] they hear the trumpet
[1:34:59] and they said
[1:35:03] so the people
[1:35:07] Thunder
[1:35:10] bad boy
[1:35:12] so we'll pick her off and what am I
[1:35:14] supposed to do the people shouted
[1:35:18] [Applause]
[1:35:26] us
[1:35:32] taking history and humiliating facts
[1:35:37] could have never been done before but it
[1:35:40] was gonna be done
[1:35:45] Hallelujah
[1:35:52] there has never been a universal Rapture
[1:35:57] but there's gonna be
[1:36:02] I thought he will be changed
[1:36:15] and the people
[1:36:19] shouted
[1:36:20] with a great shot
[1:36:23] that the wall
[1:36:25] fell down flat
[1:36:28] so that the people went up into the city
[1:36:32] every man straight before him
[1:36:35] and they took the city
[1:36:38] over the top of facts
[1:36:42] if you're going to wait for the facts to
[1:36:44] be changed you'll never be a Victorious
[1:36:45] young person
[1:36:50] but the odds are against me brother
[1:36:51] Donnie I agree they are
[1:36:54] the facts may be against you God's for
[1:36:58] you
[1:36:59] which one you're gonna believe
[1:37:01] which one you're going to believe y'all
[1:37:03] people you're going to believe the facts
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:09] Hallelujah
[1:37:14] brother Tim
[1:37:15] I'll almost killed my wife and I some
[1:37:18] other believers
[1:37:20] was in Israel a few years ago
[1:37:23] we come down near this place
[1:37:27] where Joshua was fighting a battle
[1:37:30] and he needed
[1:37:32] some more Daylight
[1:37:38] now the facts are
[1:37:40] the Sun
[1:37:42] had never stood still before
[1:37:46] but that really didn't matter
[1:37:49] he needed it to
[1:37:52] Lord
[1:37:54] what do you need to not shoot
[1:37:56] what do you need Joshua didn't have one
[1:37:59] scripture he didn't look now look at
[1:38:02] another fact even Moses didn't death
[1:38:07] speak to the son
[1:38:09] of the Moon
[1:38:15] there had never been a man
[1:38:18] since the Lord God
[1:38:20] spoke him into existence
[1:38:23] that felt like he had the authority and
[1:38:26] the right
[1:38:27] speak to the Son and the Moon
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:33] facts
[1:38:34] were against him
[1:38:37] but his need was so great
[1:38:39] he didn't care
[1:38:41] [Applause]
[1:38:43] no glory to God
[1:38:50] he didn't have one scripture
[1:38:54] he didn't have one quote
[1:38:58] reminds me of the little syrophoenician
[1:39:00] woman that come to Jesus
[1:39:03] a Greek a gentile
[1:39:06] she spent time and the Bible says it
[1:39:09] didn't even answer her a word
[1:39:11] she got after the disciples and they
[1:39:14] said Lord this woman is aggravating a
[1:39:16] far out of us
[1:39:17] it's Kentucky terms
[1:39:20] what would you send her away
[1:39:23] she's aggravating us like can you
[1:39:25] imagine you come to me or brother Ron or
[1:39:27] some of these other brothers your
[1:39:28] brother Tim and I said brother I need
[1:39:30] prayer I'll go on back and sit down
[1:39:31] young boy go on sit down you don't go
[1:39:33] sir I'm going home
[1:39:36] I'll find out here
[1:39:38] what a bunch of proud I'm pretty sure
[1:39:40] I'll never but what if Jesus is using
[1:39:42] that man to try your face
[1:39:44] you imagine this woman she didn't even
[1:39:46] have one scripture
[1:39:49] she didn't have one scripture that he
[1:39:52] would heal the Gentiles whenever he was
[1:39:54] here but her need was so great my
[1:39:56] daughter my daughter's grievously
[1:39:58] fetched with the devil I need your help
[1:40:00] in Jesus turn around and said listen to
[1:40:02] me woman you are a dog
[1:40:08] all right wow
[1:40:11] I'll tell you
[1:40:15] arrogant puffed up
[1:40:17] smart alec preacher come on
[1:40:21] there's two words used in the Greek
[1:40:23] language for dog
[1:40:25] one was big dog
[1:40:27] one was little dog
[1:40:30] Jesus used the one to the woman and said
[1:40:32] you're a big dog
[1:40:35] she come back and said no I ain't I'm a
[1:40:39] little though
[1:40:40] I'm even littler that you've made me
[1:40:43] the scriptures are astounding and
[1:40:46] brother Branham says this woman had so
[1:40:49] much faith
[1:40:50] even Jesus
[1:40:52] couldn't run her off
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:40:57] some of you can be run off by deeply run
[1:41:00] off by preacher run off because somebody
[1:41:03] didn't shake your hand Lord have mercy
[1:41:06] can your magic being such a believer
[1:41:08] that Jesus stands in your way and say
[1:41:11] you ain't coming you say yes I Am Lord
[1:41:13] yes I Am Lord I'll grab a hold to you
[1:41:17] like Jacob did the facts are against me
[1:41:20] but I've got a need I need healing I
[1:41:23] need Deliverance I need the Holy Ghost
[1:41:26] fox versus
[1:41:40] Jesus looks at this woman said
[1:41:46] some of you get so discouraged cause
[1:41:48] demons get in your way
[1:41:50] you get so discouraged cause the devil
[1:41:52] gets into a way well what if you ever
[1:41:54] meet Jesus
[1:41:57] and you say excuse me I said I said no
[1:42:00] you're not going to heaven
[1:42:03] well some of y'all look at me really
[1:42:05] funny
[1:42:07] look at Jacob and he got a hold of that
[1:42:08] man and said look
[1:42:10] I've got to be changed I'm sick of being
[1:42:13] who I am
[1:42:14] I'm sick of me I'll tell you that's a
[1:42:17] lot of our problem we're in love with me
[1:42:19] if we can ever get sick of ourselves
[1:42:23] and Jacob said I've got to be changed he
[1:42:26] said let me go I ain't letting you go I
[1:42:30] said let me go said I told you I ain't
[1:42:31] letting you because you imagine them
[1:42:33] wrestling back and forth back and forth
[1:42:34] and it's about the break of the day he
[1:42:36] touched him on his side
[1:42:38] oh oh
[1:42:46] he walked in a prowl arrogant
[1:42:50] message believer
[1:42:53] walked out like a kiss a limping Prince
[1:42:57] along with the gods I went to God Oliver
[1:43:00] Swift this meeting like living princess
[1:43:03] and like limping princesses but we've
[1:43:06] met God we've had an experience with God
[1:43:08] that's more than screaming more than
[1:43:11] shouting more than a motion that'll
[1:43:13] change us
[1:43:23] then
[1:43:25] spake
[1:43:26] Joshua
[1:43:28] to the Lord in the day when the Lord
[1:43:30] delivered a pair of Rights before the
[1:43:32] children of Israel and he said on the
[1:43:34] side of Israel
[1:43:36] sad
[1:43:39] stand thou
[1:43:42] tell
[1:43:47] upon gibeon and thou Moon
[1:43:50] hang
[1:43:52] don't you even dare move
[1:43:56] in the valley
[1:43:58] of Agilent
[1:44:00] and the Sun
[1:44:02] stood
[1:44:04] still
[1:44:07] now brother Donya there's no scientific
[1:44:09] uh
[1:44:12] uh so see you're still a fat person
[1:44:14] ain't you
[1:44:17] and you see if you use your reason
[1:44:19] against Joshua and against Moses and
[1:44:21] against Abraham and against all these
[1:44:23] others you tell me you're not going to
[1:44:25] use it for your own self when you by
[1:44:27] reason why I can't do it there's no way
[1:44:29] I failed and I've made so many mistakes
[1:44:31] y'all the devil knows there is great
[1:44:33] strengths in repeating your failures
[1:44:36] remember when David stood before Saul
[1:44:38] and David began to recall the previous
[1:44:40] victories that the Lord had done what
[1:44:42] did that do his own experiences with God
[1:44:45] enhanced and built his face and
[1:44:47] reignited thy faith of pulsation within
[1:44:50] his being and Satan learned from that
[1:44:53] principle so what will he do he will
[1:44:55] repeat our failures our mistakes our
[1:44:58] Circle all you tried it over and over
[1:45:00] again this preacher's praying for you
[1:45:02] thy preacher's prayed for me and that
[1:45:04] preacher's prayed for me I don't care if
[1:45:06] 975
[1:45:07] 000 has prayed for you don't change
[1:45:09] God's promise are you going to believe
[1:45:11] the truths or are you going to believe
[1:45:14] your past record of facts
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:22] and the Sun
[1:45:24] Stood Still
[1:45:27] now I've never tried this on the sun
[1:45:29] myself
[1:45:31] or the Moon
[1:45:33] I have been deer hunting a few times
[1:45:36] and storms coming up
[1:45:38] and I climb up my tree stand
[1:45:40] Hallelujah
[1:45:42] it's time
[1:45:44] you go back that way
[1:45:48] then of course I get my raincoat my bow
[1:45:51] and my hair on my gun whatever go ahead
[1:45:53] and leave
[1:45:54] because after I say
[1:46:04] well don't sit there and look at me
[1:46:06] something y'all have done the same thing
[1:46:07] on your battles of life
[1:46:09] all you devil is sitting here you you
[1:46:11] leave me alone Lord of God I'm leaving
[1:46:12] this meat I'll tell you one thing I'm
[1:46:14] looking for that devil be careful now
[1:46:16] the cover that you don't leave her under
[1:46:18] the anointing of these preachers
[1:46:20] why anointed man of God can preach you
[1:46:22] to such an elevation in such a spot
[1:46:24] remember the prophet told us the same
[1:46:25] thing under the influence of those gifts
[1:46:27] those demons will leave you that ain't
[1:46:29] necessarily going to be when your battle
[1:46:30] is it's going to be when you get on the
[1:46:32] bus to go back home hoping you get on
[1:46:34] the plane to go back home that's when
[1:46:36] you're going to have to meet that devil
[1:46:38] face to face you may get delivered if
[1:46:41] you're smoking you may get delivered of
[1:46:43] your porn and don't mean that devil
[1:46:45] won't try to come back on you
[1:46:48] and you'll either look at truth or facts
[1:46:59] so the sun Stood Still
[1:47:04] in the midst of heaven and hasted not to
[1:47:06] go down
[1:47:07] about a whole day
[1:47:10] wow
[1:47:12] Moses didn't even do this
[1:47:15] and there was no day like that before
[1:47:17] there after it
[1:47:18] that the Lord
[1:47:20] hearkens unto the voice
[1:47:23] of a man
[1:47:26] for the Lord
[1:47:28] fought for Israel
[1:47:33] so if he would have looked at facts
[1:47:36] it would say well Brothers maybe we
[1:47:37] should go on a seven day fast maybe we
[1:47:40] should pray a little bit maybe we should
[1:47:41] do this or that but he moved on the
[1:47:43] pulsation of the moment
[1:47:46] he felt like God he wanted to do
[1:47:49] something I'm so glad the man did aren't
[1:47:51] you
[1:47:53] there's no other place recorded in
[1:47:54] scripture or in history that this ever
[1:47:56] happened before or again but God had a
[1:48:00] man who took him at his word
[1:48:03] can I use another
[1:48:06] Gideon
[1:48:08] he certainly couldn't overcome an army
[1:48:12] with 300 men
[1:48:15] now the facts were Gideon was not a
[1:48:18] military man in the first place
[1:48:21] he had no experience as being a fighter
[1:48:24] or a leader of people
[1:48:26] as a matter of fact when the angel of
[1:48:28] the Lord come to him and he said oh I'll
[1:48:31] get him thou Mighty Man of Valor
[1:48:35] and get him would have said like we
[1:48:37] today who
[1:48:38] me
[1:48:40] you know my main Lord you got the wrong
[1:48:43] idiom there must be nothing getting
[1:48:44] around here somewhere I thought I was
[1:48:46] going to get in here in the field but
[1:48:47] apparently there's another Gideon
[1:48:48] somewhere because that is numb he said
[1:48:50] oh yes your heart oh yes your what was
[1:48:52] Gideon looking at facts
[1:48:55] facts under the hand of the enemy he
[1:48:58] hadn't done nothing for God under the
[1:49:00] hand of the enemy all will say his porn
[1:49:01] got a hold of him and his addiction's
[1:49:03] got a hold of him and he was just
[1:49:04] squandering around going to church in
[1:49:07] out in out up down up down but praise be
[1:49:10] to God the angel of the Lord saw
[1:49:12] something and Gideon that Gideon didn't
[1:49:13] see yet
[1:49:15] oh
[1:49:17] Hallelujah I pray that's what we're
[1:49:19] dealing with her tonight that the Lord
[1:49:22] sees something in all of us that we
[1:49:25] don't see yet yet
[1:49:28] we don't see it yet but we will see it
[1:49:32] is our time
[1:49:37] [Music]
[1:49:39] the midianite Army numbered 135
[1:49:46] 000. Warriors
[1:49:51] facts
[1:49:53] Gideon's not a military man
[1:49:55] the Army they're gonna meet has 135
[1:49:59] thousand
[1:50:00] trained Warriors
[1:50:03] praise the Lord
[1:50:06] now natural man would seek to increase
[1:50:09] his army so Gideon starts out with 32
[1:50:12] 000.
[1:50:13] and God looks at him and said y'all got
[1:50:15] too many
[1:50:17] what
[1:50:18] what do you mean to me
[1:50:21] 32 000 it gets 135 God said yoga way too
[1:50:24] big
[1:50:27] okay Lord whatever you say I want you to
[1:50:30] get up and tell them everybody that's
[1:50:31] afraid go back to the house
[1:50:37] my goodness the first sermon my brother
[1:50:39] Gideon got up and preached
[1:50:41] 22 000 left his church
[1:50:49] you imagine after that sermon he thought
[1:50:51] about going into apology mode now
[1:50:53] brothers and sisters I'm so sorry I must
[1:50:54] have got so excited that day please
[1:50:56] forgive me for saying that no and God
[1:50:58] wasn't done yet
[1:50:59] now look everything that's happening the
[1:51:02] facts are stacking up against Gideon
[1:51:06] 32 000 facing 130 pounds bad enough now
[1:51:10] you're standing up there and you've got
[1:51:12] ten thousand and God looks and said you
[1:51:14] know what they're still too many yeah
[1:51:17] Lord are you sure
[1:51:20] I mean ten thousand it gets 135 000
[1:51:23] people because now you're gonna wait too
[1:51:24] many tell her what you do I want you to
[1:51:27] take them down to the water
[1:51:29] I don't want you to let them start
[1:51:31] drinking
[1:51:33] yeah get inside okay
[1:51:36] right
[1:51:37] now don't say nothing to them
[1:51:39] don't make no announcements or nothing
[1:51:43] I'm gonna watch the way they drink
[1:51:46] so some of my boys come up there when
[1:51:49] they come up to the water some of them
[1:51:51] would lay down and someone would have
[1:51:53] done like this and they would have put
[1:51:55] their whole face their nose and all
[1:51:56] right down in the water and they're
[1:51:59] drinking now remember they are with
[1:52:01] insight
[1:52:03] of the enemy
[1:52:07] but over here was one over there's
[1:52:09] another there's another verse another
[1:52:10] they drunk like this
[1:52:22] God said that's my boys right there
[1:52:27] this other old boys throw caution to the
[1:52:29] wind
[1:52:30] the enemies all around them God says
[1:52:33] give me 300. I'll turn the world upside
[1:52:37] down with it
[1:52:39] Lord have mercy
[1:52:41] what can God do with this group of young
[1:52:44] people here tonight not only the young
[1:52:46] people but the rest of us in this place
[1:52:48] if we know how to drink right if we know
[1:52:51] how to approach it oh yes we know we've
[1:52:54] got an enemy and we know he's real but
[1:52:57] we also know greater is he that is in us
[1:53:01] that he's that is in the world
[1:53:13] so they get your hand down the water and
[1:53:15] laugh it like a dog

[2:02:37] going to tell you that I'm an overcomer
[2:02:39] and you are defeated why because I
[2:02:42] believe the truth
[2:02:44] the facts may be stacked up against you
[2:02:47] but the Lord
[2:02:49] is on your side
[2:02:54] this thing
[2:02:59] [Music]
[2:03:12] Samson couldn't kill a thousand for his
[2:03:15] teams well the Jawbone
[2:03:17] facts
[2:03:19] unreasonable to believe
[2:03:21] a bone is stronger than brass helmets
[2:03:24] and it's thick
[2:03:27] no historical record anyone ever fought
[2:03:30] with a child dog
[2:03:33] it hadn't been proven to be a good
[2:03:36] weapon or what we should send Alice up
[2:03:39] to this time
[2:03:43] but the truth is judges 15 15 and he
[2:03:46] found a new Jawbone of an ass and put
[2:03:49] forth his hand and took it and slew a
[2:03:53] thousand their wish
[2:03:55] oh that was the truth
[2:03:58] and Samson said with a Jawbone of an ass
[2:04:00] heaps upon heaps with a Jawbone of an
[2:04:03] ass have I Swain a thousand men and it
[2:04:05] came to pass when he had made an end of
[2:04:07] speaking that he Cast Away the Jawbone
[2:04:08] out of his hand and he called that place
[2:04:11] Ramos Lehigh and he was sore thirst and
[2:04:15] called on the Lord and said thou was
[2:04:16] given this great Deliverance to the hand
[2:04:18] of thy servant thou shall I die for
[2:04:20] thirst
[2:04:21] and fall into the hand of the
[2:04:23] uncircumcised
[2:04:25] but God claimed on Hollow Place
[2:04:29] that was in the jaw
[2:04:32] and water came there out
[2:04:35] and when he had drunk his spirit
[2:04:39] came again
[2:04:40] and he revived in other words he had a
[2:04:46] Revival
[2:04:48] out of what the very tool that God gave
[2:04:52] him to kill his enemy with
[2:04:54] [Applause]
[2:04:55] [Music]
[2:04:57] thank God
[2:04:59] wherefore he called the name thereof
[2:05:04] a hawk or a
[2:05:07] which is in Lehigh unto this day now the
[2:05:10] name this name means spring
[2:05:13] of one calling
[2:05:16] the spring
[2:05:18] of one calling
[2:05:20] oh I pray the Lord
[2:05:22] will make a few more of these places in
[2:05:24] here tonight
[2:05:26] he'll be able to hear us calling Lord
[2:05:28] God I need you I need your help I need
[2:05:31] your strength I need your deliverance I
[2:05:32] need healing I need the Holy Ghost
[2:05:34] whatever it is that you have need of
[2:05:35] tonight and God will be able to come by
[2:05:38] and tell you I've already opened up a
[2:05:41] fountain in the House of David
[2:05:43] as Jesus stood there that day in Saint
[2:05:45] John 7 37 he that believeth on me as the
[2:05:48] scripture has said out of his belly out
[2:05:51] of his belly shall flow rivers of Living
[2:05:54] Water
[2:05:55] from within you from within you oh and
[2:06:00] your Samson names this place oh I would
[2:06:03] to God that we would be able to leave
[2:06:05] this place tonight
[2:06:06] and be able to say I drove a state down
[2:06:09] the first night of camp meeting 2023. I
[2:06:13] drove a steak down from my life Satan
[2:06:15] you buffaloed me you've lied to me
[2:06:17] you've given me fact after fact I'm
[2:06:19] tired of your facts devil
[2:06:22] the Lord God healed out a clave he's cut
[2:06:25] a place tonight and opened up a fountain
[2:06:28] height it wasn't a river like the mighty
[2:06:29] Mississippi that I crossed today coming
[2:06:31] out of Mississippi into Louisiana can
[2:06:33] you imagine how tiny a stream that it
[2:06:35] must have been coming out of the Jawbone
[2:06:37] of an ass but it didn't take much to
[2:06:39] quench The Thirst of one man you
[2:06:41] understand whenever you fight some of
[2:06:42] your greatest battles you are so
[2:06:45] depleted
[2:06:50] oh God
[2:06:51] oh God
[2:06:53] and the Lord's want a tremendous Victory
[2:06:55] and you are nearly wiped out you were
[2:06:58] the most vulnerable you have ever been
[2:07:00] amen
[2:07:02] and what did God do out of that God
[2:07:06] brought a Revival
[2:07:08] Oh Praise
[2:07:11] the Lord right out of the very weapon
[2:07:14] you know the prophet said the only
[2:07:15] weapon the devil has the only one he has
[2:07:19] is to get you to doubt
[2:07:22] your weapon
[2:07:26] I'm like man man is constantly
[2:07:29] improvising improvising our Wars have
[2:07:31] changed in the last few years who would
[2:07:33] have ever thought years ago we would
[2:07:34] have been using drones
[2:07:36] to fight Wars who would have thought we
[2:07:39] would have ever been using robots you
[2:07:42] ever looked at some of the stuff that
[2:07:43] they've got into well they've got packs
[2:07:46] of robotic dogs robotic soldiers and
[2:07:50] they have bombs and they have machine
[2:07:52] guns mounted to them and they will send
[2:07:55] them things in there they're dogs and
[2:07:56] they can stand up on their hind legs and
[2:07:59] they can turn somersaults and they can
[2:08:00] roll and they can do all types of things
[2:08:02] and they can send hundreds of them in
[2:08:04] there to be able to meet the Enemy No
[2:08:07] human life lost man it's constantly
[2:08:09] improvising but God has now changed his
[2:08:12] tactics and neither has the devil the
[2:08:15] devil uses the same thing that he's used
[2:08:17] for thousands of years try to get you to
[2:08:19] doubt your weapon
[2:08:21] well I tried and I tried it didn't work
[2:08:23] it didn't work no just keep on trying it
[2:08:26] will work
[2:08:27] but he'll take your own facts of your

[2:43:47] what a way to start off a meeting
[2:43:51] settling what is facts and what is truth
[2:43:55] amen I believe you ought to think on
[2:43:58] truth
[2:44:00] think on the things of God and what he
[2:44:02] spoke about us and what he has said
[2:44:04] about us too many times we dwell too
[2:44:07] much on what maybe somebody else said
[2:44:10] about us
[2:44:12] the devil said about us
[2:44:14] tonight when you go to your beds
[2:44:17] go to bed thinking about what God said
[2:44:19] about you
[2:44:20] wake up in the morning thinking about
[2:44:22] what God said about you
[2:44:24] and what what you mean to him and his
[2:44:27] love towards you and
[2:44:29] amen what a wonderful service sermon we
[2:44:32] heard tonight
[2:44:34] maybe you need that foreign
[2:44:40] bone or that Jawbone of an ass
[2:44:44] maybe you're looking for that
[2:44:47] I'm not going to rush you out of this
[2:44:49] building
[2:44:50] maybe they've been feeling like you
[2:44:53] surrounded
[2:44:54] enemies coming on every side and you
[2:44:56] just need that promise don't leave here
[2:44:58] until you get a hold of that promise
[2:45:01] that God I need something
[2:45:03] that I can drive this enemy away
[2:45:06] that I can have the Revival that I need
[2:45:08] in my heart in my life I believe he's
[2:45:11] that kind of God for you tonight
[2:45:14] we are going to dismiss it's raining
[2:45:15] outside
[2:45:17] it's kind of messy
[2:45:19] I want to be mindful of areas around
[2:45:22] this mud around here gets very slick and
[2:45:25] you can fall down real easy I did it as
[2:45:27] a camper and know what it does and so uh
[2:45:31] just there's horrible walkways you might
[2:45:33] want to make sure you stay on those
[2:45:34] walkways and much as possible the snack
[2:45:38] areas open over there and they've also
[2:45:41] have opened up the lunchroom for you so
[2:45:44] once you get your snack you can go into
[2:45:45] the lunchroom the area and sit down and
[2:45:47] fellowship for a little while
[2:45:50] amen whatever
[2:45:51] if you need that moment with God don't
[2:45:53] don't miss it
[2:45:55] so we're going to continue to sing a few
[2:45:57] songs let you be dismissed if you have
[2:46:00] not registered if you missed that and
[2:46:02] come in later whatever somebody will
[2:46:04] meet you right here at this on this
[2:46:07] front porch of this building right here
[2:46:08] it's called the nurse's station
[2:46:11] somebody will meet you there and get you
[2:46:12] to your your dorm or give your
[2:46:15] assignment
[2:46:16] so in the morning again at 9 30. we're
[2:46:18] breakfast and wake up before that but
[2:46:21] God bless you tonight
[2:46:23] let's go very quietly and very
[2:46:25] reverently as you feel to go but if
[2:46:28] you'd like to stay and just talk to the
[2:46:29] Lord
[2:46:30] you're welcome to do that brothers and
[2:46:32] later put some music on whatever
[2:46:35] but just find that moment with God
[2:46:38] Lord I need a Jawbone I need a promise
[2:46:41] God bless you tonight and You Are God
[2:46:45] Alone
