[41:00] let's turn to mark chapter four
[41:03] amen like to
[41:05] continue on a little bit and
[41:07] follow up from last wednesday
[41:15] hey man
[41:17] i'd like to speak to you on undisturbed
[41:21] undisturbed
[41:22] mark chapter 4 and verse 35 it says in
[41:25] the same day
[41:26] when the evening was come
[41:28] he said unto them let us pass over to
[41:31] the other side
[41:33] and when they had sent away the
[41:35] multitudes
[41:37] they took him even as he was in this
[41:39] ship
[41:40] and there were also with him other
[41:42] little ships
[41:43] and there arose a great storm of wind
[41:46] and the waves beat the ship
[41:48] so that it was now full
[41:50] but he was in the hinder part of the
[41:52] ship
[41:53] asleep on a pillow
[41:55] and they awake him and said unto him
[41:57] master
[41:59] carest thou not that we perish
[42:01] and he arose and rebuked the whim and
[42:04] said unto the sea peace be still
[42:07] and the wind ceased
[42:09] and there was a great calm
[42:12] amen we'll let you be seated
[42:20] i was
[42:21] studying this scripture a little bit
[42:23] more this week as
[42:25] as i was looking for something to
[42:27] minister to tonight and i ran across
[42:29] across this quote
[42:31] and it really jumped out at me brother
[42:33] branham and melchizedek the great prince
[42:35] and king he says faith
[42:37] never rushes itself
[42:39] faith always knows what it's talking
[42:42] about
[42:43] he said you never seen our master
[42:45] excited about anything
[42:47] standing by the grave of a dead man he
[42:49] was just as calm as he was when he sat
[42:52] on the mount and looked over jerusalem
[42:55] standing on a ship in troubled seas and
[42:57] the waves tossing him around about
[43:00] he was so completely resting in god
[43:03] until it never even paid he never even
[43:06] paid attention to
[43:08] attention to the storms enough to wake
[43:10] him up
[43:11] see faith is always undisturbed
[43:15] he said now we find here that the reason
[43:17] that we can be undisturbed because we
[43:20] have been given a promise through our
[43:22] father abraham to his children and the
[43:25] god who gave the promise he swore by the
[43:28] oath that he would keep the promise that
[43:31] he gave to us
[43:32] amen a faith that is undisturbed so to
[43:35] have a place of faith that is
[43:37] undisturbed the faith has to have a
[43:39] resting place
[43:40] faith has to be at rest and we find a
[43:43] very interesting story as we read it
[43:46] again tonight of of a crossing of a sea
[43:48] in it and you know it seemed like
[43:50] everything was going wonderful and
[43:52] everything was maybe
[43:54] peaceful as it started out on the
[43:55] journey and they find themselves
[43:57] somewhere out in the middle of the sea
[43:59] and and we know the devil as he knew
[44:01] what was taking place and he saw maybe a
[44:04] chance to to take them out and he began
[44:06] to get into the winds and to the waves
[44:08] and and to cause a storm to come up but
[44:11] in the middle of this storm was really a
[44:13] paradox that was taking place
[44:15] when the storm was beaten against the
[44:17] ship so much that the scripture says
[44:20] that it had filled the very vessel they
[44:22] were in and it was about to sink and
[44:24] here right in the middle of a boat
[44:26] filled with water and it was tossing
[44:28] around it was a man that was at rest
[44:31] a man that was sleeping there in the
[44:33] ship and so as you look at this there
[44:35] had to be something in him that was
[44:37] greater than the physical uh mannerism
[44:40] or the physical the physic physicalities
[44:43] of his being or his thoughts or or his
[44:45] reasoning because no man with you know
[44:47] how it is you'd be laying in bed one
[44:49] night and you hear a little thunder
[44:50] rumble and it wakes you up or are you
[44:52] beginning to get worried about is it a
[44:54] tornado is it this there's all kind of
[44:56] thoughts run through your mind when you
[44:58] hear these things taking place but here
[45:00] he had spoke the word let's go to the
[45:02] other side and he had enough faith in
[45:05] that word that that word was going to
[45:06] come to pass that when he gets in the
[45:09] middle of a storm and he gets in the
[45:10] middle of the chaos all around him it
[45:13] does not worry him it does not fret him
[45:15] he does not get concerned about it he
[45:17] continues to be at rest and i believe we
[45:20] can we can gain a great lesson from this
[45:23] because we also face storms we also face
[45:26] trouble sometimes we're in one of the
[45:28] most troublesome times that's ever come
[45:30] upon the face of this earth and so we
[45:32] also have things in our lives and if
[45:34] we're not careful we go to our own
[45:36] thoughts our own humanistic ideas our
[45:38] ways our reasonings and we begin to
[45:41] become become uh you know unrestful or
[45:44] weary or are tore up about situations in
[45:47] our lives and that the thing we could
[45:49] stay in is in the word of god that the
[45:51] word of god is going to come to pass no
[45:54] matter how much satan fights against it
[45:57] no matter how much hell screams and how
[45:59] much waves comes no matter how how
[46:02] tumultuous it may seem his word will
[46:04] come to pass he's kept every promise
[46:07] he's kept every word amen he stood for
[46:10] us against every sickness and disease he
[46:12] has conquered every sin let me let you
[46:15] know in on something god has got this
[46:19] amen maybe you need to look at your
[46:21] situation and tell your situation god's
[46:24] got this he's greater than my problems
[46:26] he's greater than my struggles he's
[46:28] greater than the things that i'm going
[46:30] through maybe you're facing some great
[46:32] financial struggle he's greater than
[46:34] that maybe you're facing the greatest of
[46:37] great sickness nigh unto death he's
[46:39] greater than that you know he would tell
[46:41] us in luke chapter 12 and verse 24 he
[46:44] would say consider the ravens for they
[46:46] never sow nor reap which neither have
[46:49] storehouses nor barns but god feedeth
[46:53] them and how much more are ye better
[46:56] than the fouls
[46:59] hallelujah amen about a raven is not he
[47:02] don't have a barn somewhere and he's
[47:03] looking at it and it's like wow i need
[47:05] to go do something about it my barn's
[47:07] getting low he's not even concerned
[47:08] about a barn amen he knows he has a
[47:10] heavenly father and that heavenly father
[47:12] is going to watch over him he's going to
[47:15] provide for him he's going to take care
[47:17] of him he's going to give him what he
[47:19] has need of and and he says how much
[47:21] more are ye than the fowls if i'll take
[47:24] care of a little bird or a raven or if
[47:26] i'll take care of the the the the the
[47:29] things of this earth i'm in the
[47:31] the the animals of this world how much
[47:34] more will i take care of you
[47:37] amen and which of you can by taking
[47:39] thought add to his statute one cubit if
[47:42] you then be able to do that thing which
[47:44] is least why take you thought for the
[47:46] rest if you can't even do that why worry
[47:49] about the rest of it
[47:50] amen consider the lilies how they grow
[47:53] they toil not they spin not yet i say
[47:56] unto you that solomon in all of his
[47:58] glory was not arrayed like one of these
[48:01] if then god so clothed the grass which
[48:03] is today in the field and tomorrow is
[48:06] cast into the oven how much more will he
[48:09] clothe ye o ye of little faith seek not
[48:13] you that which you shall eat or what you
[48:15] shall drink neither be ye of doubtful
[48:18] mind
[48:20] now if you look at this doubtful mind
[48:22] it's actually very interesting it's
[48:24] actually the same metaphors taken from
[48:26] the metaphor of a ship that's being
[48:29] tossed about going up and down up and
[48:31] down up and down one day it's high next
[48:34] day is low one moment it's on the top of
[48:36] the way the next day or the next moment
[48:38] it feels like it's about to crash to the
[48:40] bottom of the ocean he's telling us
[48:42] don't have that kind of mind but have
[48:44] one mind the mind of christ amen the
[48:47] mind of christ will go to sleep in the
[48:50] middle of a storm
[48:53] he'll be at rest amen because he knows
[48:55] god will keep his word
[48:59] amen that's why we can we don't need to
[49:01] get all tore up about sicknesses and
[49:03] things and it's very easy to do but
[49:04] don't get tore up about it god will keep
[49:07] his word
[49:09] amen so don't be of doubtful mind it's
[49:12] to lift one's soul or it's to buoy up
[49:14] and down with hope
[49:17] i hope it's going to be okay
[49:20] i hope i'm going to get well i hope i'm
[49:22] going to get out of this problems i hope
[49:24] this is going to happen it's got to move
[49:26] beyond hope
[49:28] because hope is up and down
[49:31] hope is like a buoy on an ocean
[49:33] somewhere and you're up one day and down
[49:35] the next amen you want you don't want to
[49:37] be of a doubtful mind but you understand
[49:39] that he watches over the lilies that
[49:42] they grow
[49:43] amen where does the lily come from it
[49:45] comes from the very bottom of the of the
[49:47] pond and the ma the most mary muck you
[49:50] ever seen in the darkest place but
[49:52] there's a sun up there and it begins to
[49:54] call for life and it begins to bring it
[49:57] out of that muck and out of that stuff
[49:59] and bring it to the top of the water
[50:01] until it can burst forth its flower
[50:05] oh i'm looking at some lilies tonight
[50:08] amen you wasn't down in some very dire
[50:10] situation very dark very dismal and god
[50:14] called you out of that well if god
[50:16] called you out of that you can rest
[50:17] assured he's going to take care of you
[50:20] he's going to provide for you he's going
[50:22] to do everything he can for you if he
[50:24] would take care of a bird he'll take
[50:26] care of you
[50:28] [Applause]
[50:31] so don't be of a doubtful mind
[50:34] tossed about by the winds and the waves
[50:38] because it causes one to waver or to
[50:41] fluctuate in the mind
[50:44] it's to agitate or harass with cares
[50:48] is to make anxious
[50:51] amen make anxious
[50:53] amen brother and we'll say it like this
[50:55] he says see faith
[50:56] doesn't look at the present time
[51:00] faith doesn't see what's right here
[51:04] faith looks to what god wants and it
[51:07] works accordingly
[51:10] amen your site sees what's right here
[51:13] your site sees the problems your site
[51:15] sees your bank account your site sees
[51:18] this your site sees that it sees all
[51:20] kinds of issues that ain't what faith
[51:22] looks like he said faith is a long-range
[51:25] vision
[51:27] amen faith is a long-range vision it
[51:30] never lowers its sight
[51:33] oh come on now that ought to make you
[51:35] shout right there
[51:36] faith never lowers your sight it holds
[51:40] to the target
[51:42] he said you get a good shooter and knows
[51:44] what he's talking about or ever done any
[51:46] long-range shooting he said it's like
[51:48] binoculars he said you don't look you
[51:50] don't look you don't look around real
[51:51] close with binoculars
[51:54] you don't look at your watch through a
[51:55] pair of binoculars
[51:57] amen he says you look at things that are
[52:00] far off he said faith does that faith
[52:03] picks up god's binoculars both the old
[52:07] and new testament and it sees every
[52:10] promise that he made
[52:12] no matter what's right here in front of
[52:14] you
[52:17] oh hallelujah right here in front of you
[52:19] might be cancer it might be every kind
[52:21] of disease of the world amen might be
[52:23] every kind of issues maybe all kinds of
[52:25] things but faith will pick up the word
[52:27] of god and look at a promise
[52:31] come on now
[52:32] amen faith sees it out yonder faith
[52:36] chooses this regardless of what present
[52:39] tense says
[52:41] regardless of what it looks like
[52:44] regardless of what the doctor's report
[52:46] says that matters not to faith faith is
[52:49] looking at a promise
[52:51] faith is looking out there and it's
[52:53] saying it's now
[52:55] he's the lord god that heals all our
[52:57] diseases
[52:58] now by his stripes i'm healed now my
[53:01] family is healed
[53:05] and it never drops its sights down to
[53:08] look away
[53:10] i love that
[53:12] when faith is centered on a target they
[53:14] ain't a devil in hell they can say you
[53:15] know what you need to lower your
[53:16] standards just a little bit
[53:18] you need to lower it down a little bit
[53:20] man he said he said your offspring well
[53:22] maybe that just means one of them
[53:24] not all of them but maybe just one of
[53:26] them maybe just a few of your children
[53:29] is going to be saved the rest of them is
[53:30] going to be low maybe maybe it just
[53:32] means the healing is just for some of
[53:34] them lower your sights down just a
[53:36] little bit amen get it off you that's
[53:38] not where it belongs no your faith keeps
[53:41] it right on the target
[53:43] and it says by his stripes i am healed
[53:47] doesn't matter what's present tense
[53:49] doesn't matter what the doctor says
[53:52] doesn't matter what any devil says
[53:57] it keeps the crosshairs dead center on
[53:59] the word
[54:00] that's what faith does
[54:05] amen but see unbelief will catch
[54:07] reasoning
[54:08] well you know reason you know it reasons
[54:11] away the word it reads well you know we
[54:13] don't we don't have to have church
[54:14] tonight
[54:16] we just haven't just come together and
[54:17] have a good little time and go back home
[54:19] we're all right
[54:20] and that's not what faith says
[54:22] faith says i need something from god and
[54:24] i'm going to get something from god
[54:26] faith reaching out there and grabbing it
[54:28] said faith always looks to the word
[54:32] that is its resting place
[54:34] unbelief relies on reasonings present
[54:37] day things present time things what's
[54:40] going on right now that's what reasoning
[54:42] is relying on
[54:44] that's what reasoning will always take
[54:46] you back to is what is happening right
[54:49] now what did the doctor's report say
[54:53] what does it look like what is the child
[54:55] doing right now what is going on right
[54:57] now at your work what's happening right
[54:59] now reasoning is always taking you to
[55:02] present tense faith is looking long
[55:04] distance
[55:07] amen that word still the remain remains
[55:10] there and this is where jesus faith led
[55:12] let's go to the other side
[55:15] his faith was already over there on the
[55:18] other side where a little heart was
[55:20] crying out for help
[55:22] he wasn't looking at present tense and
[55:24] the storms and the winds that was trying
[55:26] to keep it he wasn't going to keep him
[55:28] from making it
[55:30] because the word already said let's go
[55:32] to the other side
[55:34] come on now listen you can look at
[55:37] present tense or you want to but the
[55:39] devil is not going to keep this bride
[55:42] from taking a body change
[55:44] you can look at all the problems you can
[55:46] look at all the situations you can look
[55:48] at all the false doctrines you can look
[55:50] at at all but i'm looking by faith
[55:53] his word said i'll never pride without
[55:56] spot without wrinkle without blemish
[55:59] she's going in a rapture
[56:01] so it does not matter what present tense
[56:03] says
[56:06] faith looks to the word
[56:08] faith puts itself upon an unmovable rock
[56:12] faith does not look at reasoning he said
[56:14] i don't care how much you can show it
[56:16] would be better if the word says no
[56:19] faith rests there it's the sanctuary of
[56:22] faith's resting place
[56:25] the word is
[56:26] amen faith come by hearing hearing by
[56:29] the word of god
[56:31] amen see faith finds the word its
[56:34] sanctuary of rest it moves right on to
[56:37] the top of that eternal rock christ
[56:40] christ jesus the word and it lays down
[56:43] there and rests
[56:46] undisturbed
[56:48] it lays down there and rest
[56:51] it's resting on the word
[56:53] amen we don't have to be all tore up
[56:55] about this body change we just need to
[56:57] rest on the word
[57:00] we don't have to be torn up about being
[57:02] healed or not rest on the word
[57:05] his word said it
[57:07] he said it i believe it
[57:12] the resting place for the christian amen
[57:14] when it's laying there on the word let
[57:17] the winds have let the storm shake she
[57:21] is safe
[57:24] oh hallelujah if you rest on the word
[57:27] that's where faith genuine christian
[57:29] faith rests the rest in place is the
[57:31] word for it knows that god will ever
[57:34] prove himself superior over every one of
[57:37] his enemies
[57:38] no matter how bad it looks how many
[57:40] enemies there are how it looks like
[57:42] you're defeated faith stills knows
[57:45] you're going to overcome
[57:47] faith still knows you're going to have
[57:49] victory faith still knows your children
[57:52] are coming back faith still knows my
[57:54] body is going to line up to the word of
[57:56] god that's what faith declares
[58:04] he said now do you sick people
[58:08] how i'd like to drive this home
[58:11] is that when you catch that faith that
[58:13] you're going to be healed
[58:15] every circumstance
[58:17] all signs
[58:19] and all symptoms everything can point
[58:21] that you're dying
[58:24] but you will never move
[58:27] you're resting
[58:28] undisturbed
[58:31] sleeping while it's storming
[58:35] hey man
[58:37] it took me a long time to do that
[58:39] i used to work for a pirate company for
[58:42] quite some time and you hear a storm
[58:44] coming there tonight you know he's about
[58:45] to get caught up and called out so you
[58:46] just get up
[58:48] wake up lay there and wait for your
[58:49] phone to go off
[58:51] i i quit there probably six seven years
[58:54] still storm come i'm expecting my phone
[58:56] to go off
[58:57] took me a long time now i love to hear
[58:59] thunder
[59:00] you know
[59:01] i may have this thought go to poor
[59:02] brother phillip
[59:05] and ain't poor brother timothy no more
[59:09] amen
[59:10] amen but you know you find yourself at
[59:13] rest
[59:14] it can be lightening it can be all kinds
[59:16] of things going on but i'm not worried
[59:17] about it no more
[59:20] amen and this is where we have to get to
[59:22] if you want god to do something for you
[59:24] you've got to find that place of rest
[59:27] you can't be up there up about it and
[59:29] down about it this way about it you got
[59:31] to stay there on face resting place and
[59:34] that is the word of god
[59:37] and when the devil comes with reason you
[59:39] do like jesus you go back to the word of
[59:42] god he comes with torment you go back to
[59:44] the word of god he goes with mind
[59:46] battles you go back to the word of god
[59:50] and just because you got the holy ghost
[59:52] does not mean you're not going to have
[59:54] mind battles
[59:57] jesus had them
[59:59] just as soon as he left the river
[1:00:03] being baptized with the spirit of god
[1:00:05] the first man that the spirit of god
[1:00:08] would descend upon and stay in
[1:00:12] david it came down it left it came down
[1:00:14] and left amen but here's the first man
[1:00:16] that it came into and it stayed
[1:00:19] and he was taken up into the wilderness
[1:00:21] to be tempted
[1:00:23] somehow we get the idea that we're gonna
[1:00:25] we're gonna fight we're gonna get the
[1:00:27] holy ghost and it's all going to be over
[1:00:28] with no sir that's when you're really
[1:00:30] getting into the battle
[1:00:32] that's a good sign that you have
[1:00:34] received something from god when the
[1:00:36] devil's trying to take it from you
[1:00:39] but let me tell you something the devil
[1:00:41] will never take from you what he didn't
[1:00:43] give you
[1:00:46] when god deposited that on the inside of
[1:00:49] you there ain't a devil in hell that can
[1:00:51] take it from you
[1:00:54] so you can rest
[1:00:56] take him back to the word
[1:00:58] don't get stood up and stir it up and
[1:01:00] say well i just lost no you ain't lost
[1:01:01] nothing keep fighting keep holding
[1:01:04] keep staying there in the word stay
[1:01:06] there upon that on that eternal resting
[1:01:08] place
[1:01:09] not make belief
[1:01:11] genuine faith
[1:01:13] not hope
[1:01:14] but faith
[1:01:17] hope is there hoping it was in
[1:01:19] faith is already in
[1:01:23] oh man i hope you caught that i
[1:01:25] i've read these over and over and i just
[1:01:27] kind of caught that one myself
[1:01:29] he said hope is looking in there hope
[1:01:31] we're hoping it was in there wishing it
[1:01:33] was in there he said faith is already in
[1:01:35] there looking out
[1:01:40] amen when you look at these scriptures
[1:01:42] with hope you're hoping this is my name
[1:01:45] you're hoping this is who i am you're
[1:01:47] hoping i'm the one that says by his
[1:01:49] stripes i hope that's me but when you
[1:01:51] have faith
[1:01:52] you're in the scripture looking out
[1:01:55] you're in there and say buy your stripes
[1:01:57] i am healed
[1:01:58] never take your hands off of god's
[1:02:00] property i never belonged to you in the
[1:02:02] first place
[1:02:09] but all signs all symptoms all
[1:02:11] circumstances everything can point that
[1:02:13] you're dying
[1:02:14] but you won't move from it
[1:02:17] you won't move it's resting place you
[1:02:20] find the rest
[1:02:22] undisturbed
[1:02:24] that faith
[1:02:26] take when there's that's where faith
[1:02:28] takes its resting place it's done
[1:02:31] right
[1:02:32] it's done
[1:02:33] for it knows that god will never
[1:02:36] never let the enemy right over the top
[1:02:40] of him
[1:02:41] he never has faith knows that regardless
[1:02:45] of what it looks like god noah knew the
[1:02:47] ark would float certainly did daniel
[1:02:49] knew that god would close the lion's
[1:02:51] mouth the hebrew god children knew god
[1:02:54] could stop the fire jesus knew god would
[1:02:56] raise him up again because why the word
[1:02:58] said so
[1:03:01] i'll not leave my soul in hell neither i
[1:03:04] suffer my holy one to see corruption he
[1:03:06] knew corruption would set him with 20 72
[1:03:09] hours within three days i'll raise it up
[1:03:12] again what was it hid by faith
[1:03:15] he rested on a word
[1:03:22] reason we tried his best to recognize
[1:03:24] well
[1:03:25] this system is bound to be better this
[1:03:27] is that but it looks it looks better
[1:03:29] because you're looking with the
[1:03:30] intellectual mind
[1:03:34] you can prove reasonings by your
[1:03:36] intellectual mind
[1:03:38] you can't prove faith
[1:03:40] if you can prove it it ain't no longer
[1:03:42] faith
[1:03:45] by faith
[1:03:47] but faith knows only the word and the
[1:03:49] promise
[1:03:50] and it looks to that thing
[1:03:53] that you do not yet see
[1:03:56] faith sees things you can't see with
[1:03:58] your intellect
[1:04:02] faith sees things you can't see with
[1:04:04] your mind
[1:04:06] your own your own physical attributes
[1:04:10] that's the reason
[1:04:11] you can rest assured because you're not
[1:04:14] no longer looking with these eyes
[1:04:16] you're looking with faith
[1:04:19] by faith we can go through the
[1:04:21] scriptures
[1:04:22] but you know even death
[1:04:24] itself can't shake faith
[1:04:28] men stand right in death right in the
[1:04:30] face of death and shout the victory of
[1:04:33] the resurrection
[1:04:35] oh death where is your sting oh grave
[1:04:38] where is your victory
[1:04:40] christ will raise me up
[1:04:44] see faith makes the word of god its
[1:04:46] sanctuary of its eternal rest and it
[1:04:50] lays in the word of god
[1:04:52] it does not lay in how you feel it does
[1:04:55] not lay in how you think it does not lay
[1:04:58] in how you how you imagine things it
[1:05:00] does not lay in any of that it only lays
[1:05:03] in the word of god
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:06] amen he would say in john 14 and verse 1
[1:05:09] let not your heart be troubled you
[1:05:11] believe in god believe also in me this
[1:05:14] trouble is to be agitated or troubled by
[1:05:17] parts by the movement of parts moving to
[1:05:20] and fro it's to cause one inward
[1:05:22] commotion it's to take away his calmness
[1:05:25] of mind is to disturb your presence of
[1:05:28] mind it's to disquiet you or make you
[1:05:30] restless or to stir you up or to be
[1:05:33] troubled or to strike you with fear and
[1:05:35] dread or to render you anxious or
[1:05:37] distressed to perplex your mind
[1:05:41] by suggesting doubts
[1:05:44] let not your heart be troubled
[1:05:50] this is what he would tell the disciples
[1:05:51] as he's leaving
[1:05:54] but it's also to us
[1:05:56] because he's coming back
[1:05:59] and he said
[1:06:00] it because in my father's house are many
[1:06:03] mansions
[1:06:07] kind of imagine brother timothy
[1:06:09] that's something about this tall
[1:06:13] some brown hair some black-haired ones
[1:06:15] some red-haired ones
[1:06:17] ain't gonna be no gray-haired ones
[1:06:19] no bald-headed ones
[1:06:24] amen some blond-headed ones
[1:06:28] ain't gonna be no purple-headed ones
[1:06:32] pink headed one green headed one ain't
[1:06:34] gonna be none of that
[1:06:37] hey man ain't gonna be no highlighted
[1:06:38] ones
[1:06:40] fakely done
[1:06:42] ain't gonna be none of that
[1:06:47] there's mansions there
[1:06:50] and if it wasn't so
[1:06:52] i would have told you
[1:06:55] if it wasn't true i'd have told you
[1:06:57] there ain't no hope for
[1:06:58] you but i'm telling you this so you know
[1:07:02] there is a place provided for you
[1:07:06] so you can be at rest let not your heart
[1:07:08] be troubled amen there's going to be all
[1:07:10] kind of problems he didn't tell him
[1:07:11] about all that he didn't tell them about
[1:07:13] what they're about to go through he
[1:07:14] didn't tell them about the crucifixion
[1:07:16] they're about to face and the scourge
[1:07:18] and the boiling pots of oil he didn't
[1:07:20] tell him about none of that
[1:07:22] he just said let not your heart be
[1:07:23] troubled because i got a place for you
[1:07:27] hallelujah and this is what he wants to
[1:07:29] tell you tonight again let not your
[1:07:32] heart be troubled
[1:07:35] you'll face perplexity of time you'll
[1:07:37] face sicknesses you'll face every kind
[1:07:39] of thing but i ain't got to we ain't got
[1:07:41] to worry about all that i've already got
[1:07:43] that taken care of i have a place
[1:07:46] prepared for you
[1:07:49] a body not made with hands
[1:07:53] a body that never sinned in
[1:08:00] if it was not were not true i would have
[1:08:02] told you
[1:08:03] but i go to prepare a place for you
[1:08:06] and if i go
[1:08:08] and prepare a place for you i've got to
[1:08:10] go do this
[1:08:11] so i can come again
[1:08:15] if it wasn't true he would have told you
[1:08:18] but he told you i will come again and
[1:08:20] receive you unto myself that where i am
[1:08:24] there you may be also and whether i go
[1:08:28] you know and the way you know
[1:08:31] thomas said well lord what are you
[1:08:32] talking about i don't know what you're
[1:08:34] talking about where you're going and i
[1:08:35] don't know the way
[1:08:39] jesus said unto him i am the way
[1:08:43] this is why you know it i am the way i
[1:08:46] am the truth i am the life and no man
[1:08:49] can come unto the father but by me
[1:08:53] so i have made the way
[1:08:55] i have provided it i have set it all up
[1:08:58] for you let not your heart be traveled
[1:09:00] let not your heart be troubled i have
[1:09:02] spent a place for you not only have i
[1:09:04] made a place for you i'm going to come
[1:09:07] back and i'm going to receive you unto
[1:09:09] myself that where i am you can be also
[1:09:14] that you can experience the same peace
[1:09:17] that you can have the same joy that you
[1:09:19] can understand
[1:09:20] what i understand that you can know in
[1:09:22] fullness how i know
[1:09:27] that's faith's resting place
[1:09:32] if you hadn't known me you'd have known
[1:09:34] my father also from henceforth you shall
[1:09:36] know him and have seen him
[1:09:39] and philip said to them lord
[1:09:41] show us the father and it suffices us
[1:09:44] and jesus said to them have i been so
[1:09:46] long time with you
[1:09:48] and yet hast thou not known me philip
[1:09:51] he that has seen me
[1:09:53] has seen the father
[1:09:54] and how sayeth thou then showed us the
[1:09:56] father believeth thou not that i am the
[1:09:58] father and the father in me
[1:10:01] and the words that i speak unto you i
[1:10:03] speak not of myself but the father that
[1:10:05] dwelleth in me he doeth the work believe
[1:10:07] me that i'm in the father and the father
[1:10:10] in me or else believe me for the very
[1:10:11] work's sake barely breathe out saying to
[1:10:13] you he that believeth on me the works he
[1:10:16] that puts his faith in me
[1:10:20] faith's resting place this is believe in
[1:10:21] faith he that puts his faith in me the
[1:10:25] works that i do shall he do also and
[1:10:28] greater works than these shall he do
[1:10:30] because i go to my father and whatsoever
[1:10:32] you ask in my name that will i do that
[1:10:36] the father may be glorified in the son
[1:10:38] if you ask anything in my name i will do
[1:10:42] it
[1:10:43] if it wasn't so i would have told you
[1:10:52] faith
[1:10:53] is just as positive as your eyes sight
[1:10:56] is here even more
[1:10:59] faith is more real
[1:11:01] than your eyesight or your feelings
[1:11:04] to even know this desk is here
[1:11:07] how many knows this desk is right here
[1:11:08] can you see it
[1:11:10] i can feel it i can see it
[1:11:13] it's produced to me by my senses
[1:11:19] but what if we had put something here
[1:11:21] before the service
[1:11:24] and said
[1:11:25] the desk is here the desk maybe ain't
[1:11:27] here
[1:11:31] then what
[1:11:33] your faith couldn't declare it or your
[1:11:35] site couldn't declare it
[1:11:37] because you wouldn't be able to see it
[1:11:42] let's see there's a bottle of water
[1:11:43] there
[1:11:45] how many believes that bottle of water
[1:11:46] is there
[1:11:51] how many believes it
[1:11:53] you believe me
[1:11:56] somebody some of you say you can't
[1:11:57] believe me unless i'm behind the pulpit
[1:11:58] so maybe
[1:12:01] [Laughter]
[1:12:05] mercy
[1:12:08] but i told you it's there
[1:12:11] so why do you believe it's there
[1:12:13] because i told you it's there
[1:12:16] let's see if it's there
[1:12:18] well i'll be
[1:12:20] it's there
[1:12:21] if you'd believe the ma the words of a
[1:12:23] mortal man
[1:12:24] that a bottle of water was sitting there
[1:12:27] how much more can we believe the the
[1:12:29] words of an immortal god that says by my
[1:12:32] stripes you're healed
[1:12:39] amen what puts it there faith puts it
[1:12:41] there
[1:12:41] faith in his word that he's never told
[1:12:43] you a lie
[1:12:45] he's never done you wrong he's always
[1:12:47] been there for you he brought you out of
[1:12:49] the mirey clay set your feet up on a
[1:12:50] rock he took care of you this far i can
[1:12:53] believe what he says
[1:12:56] and if it wasn't so he would have told
[1:12:57] me
[1:13:00] but he told me it was so
[1:13:02] cause he said it
[1:13:05] he put it in his word so it has to be
[1:13:07] there even though i mean i see it right
[1:13:09] now he said it
[1:13:12] even though i can't put my hands on it
[1:13:14] he said it
[1:13:16] oh hallelujah amen you may not be able
[1:13:19] to put your hands right now on your
[1:13:21] healing but that does not change your
[1:13:23] healing you may not be able to put your
[1:13:26] eyes or your thoughts or your mind on
[1:13:28] your healing and grasp it with your
[1:13:30] feelings or grasping with your thoughts
[1:13:32] but your faith says he said it i believe
[1:13:36] it he said it i'm gonna stand on it i'm
[1:13:39] gonna rest on it i don't care how bad it
[1:13:41] gets i don't care how hard it rolls
[1:13:44] the winds may come and the waves may get
[1:13:47] higher and higher and higher and it
[1:13:48] seems like i'm sinking i'm just going to
[1:13:51] rest
[1:13:54] undisturbed
[1:13:59] when you have that kind of faith
[1:14:01] you know it's going to happen you know
[1:14:03] it's going to be there and nothing can
[1:14:05] take it out if the doctor stands and say
[1:14:07] you're dying the next hour you know
[1:14:09] you're going to get well
[1:14:12] he might tell you you're covered over
[1:14:14] with cancer or leprosy's eating you up
[1:14:16] that wouldn't scare you one bit
[1:14:19] you can be at rest
[1:14:22] hey man look at paul when he was in that
[1:14:24] ship there and it was about to go down
[1:14:26] i've been waterlogging raining for days
[1:14:28] and days and days all hope was gone
[1:14:31] they've been chunking stuff over the
[1:14:33] ship trying to save themselves and paul
[1:14:36] amen goes in there and begins to pray
[1:14:38] and the angel comes and speaks to him
[1:14:40] and says paul
[1:14:41] amen you're going to be brought before
[1:14:43] caesar don't worry about it stay with
[1:14:45] the ship it's going to be okay
[1:14:50] amen and it goes right out in the middle
[1:14:52] of the storm
[1:14:54] and he runs outside and he's shaking his
[1:14:56] hands with everyone and screaming it's
[1:14:58] going to be okay be of good courage
[1:15:01] don't worry about it there's an angel
[1:15:03] that said you don't have to be afraid
[1:15:06] amen we're going to go right before
[1:15:08] caesar and we're going to be okay stay
[1:15:11] with the ship
[1:15:15] and i'll say this in the name of the
[1:15:16] lord whatever you do don't get out of
[1:15:18] the ship
[1:15:20] stay with it it may seem like it's going
[1:15:22] down it may seem like it's about to go
[1:15:24] to the bottom it may seem like it's
[1:15:26] impossible and you're not ever going to
[1:15:28] come out with that but don't forget
[1:15:30] who's resting in your ship
[1:15:34] amen and we know the story amen the ship
[1:15:37] as they stayed there they were saved and
[1:15:39] they got on the island and they began to
[1:15:41] build a fire and a snake bit him and he
[1:15:43] just grabbed the snake and he threw it
[1:15:45] off in the fire
[1:15:47] amen just threw it off in the fire and
[1:15:49] they were all amazed why could he do
[1:15:51] that because he had faith in the words
[1:15:54] of an angel
[1:15:55] he had faith in what the angel had spoke
[1:15:57] to him you're going to stand before
[1:15:59] caesar
[1:16:02] and the words of an angel were greater
[1:16:04] than a snake bite
[1:16:07] hallelujah i'm here to tell you the
[1:16:09] words of your savior it's greater than
[1:16:11] any sin it's greater than any sickness
[1:16:14] it's greater than any disease by his
[1:16:17] strife i am healed
[1:16:20] so tonight let's shake that snake off in
[1:16:22] the fire
[1:16:27] the words of our savior's greater than
[1:16:28] the poison of the snake
[1:16:38] ship was pitching just as hard as it
[1:16:39] ever was
[1:16:40] still no stars still no moon still no
[1:16:43] days
[1:16:46] passing he said
[1:16:48] paul didn't worry a bit
[1:16:50] he said boys i need another sandwich i'm
[1:16:52] hungry
[1:16:55] walking up down the deck glory to god
[1:16:57] we're not far from land
[1:16:59] see no matter how dark it got
[1:17:02] a whale he said might have come and
[1:17:04] turned the ship over and sharks
[1:17:06] following that well by the hundreds that
[1:17:08] wouldn't phase paul
[1:17:10] he had the word of the angel
[1:17:12] he knew what god had said he believed
[1:17:14] that god he believed what god had said
[1:17:16] wherefore brother be of good courage
[1:17:18] for i believe
[1:17:20] that it should be it'll be just as he
[1:17:22] showed it to me see there's faith
[1:17:25] go out on the aisle there he picked up a
[1:17:26] bunch of sticks through in the fire no
[1:17:28] snake bit him but he didn't phase him
[1:17:31] he just shook it off and kept going
[1:17:34] that's faith you set your course your
[1:17:36] course is set you know exactly where
[1:17:38] you're standing
[1:17:40] and you just keep on he said see when if
[1:17:42] an individual can pray
[1:17:45] till you strike that same place
[1:17:49] there isn't enough doctors to tell you
[1:17:51] you is going to remain sick
[1:17:55] that's right he's in this covenant and
[1:17:57] he said see what happens is you got to
[1:17:59] get to that place
[1:18:05] to where you can be undisturbed
[1:18:10] well i just need an angel well we've
[1:18:11] already got the word of god
[1:18:14] i believe his word
[1:18:16] he said it
[1:18:18] i believe it
[1:18:22] we could talk about israel how they lost
[1:18:24] their covenant lost their freedom
[1:18:26] or loss of freedom not the covenant but
[1:18:28] when god made the covenant with abraham
[1:18:29] isaac and jacob he swore by himself that
[1:18:31] he'd save abraham and his seed after him
[1:18:33] and god's duty bound to keep that
[1:18:35] promise
[1:18:36] and he's just as duty bound to you on
[1:18:40] that promise as he was to abraham's seed
[1:18:43] on the promise
[1:18:44] if you're abraham's seed how many does
[1:18:46] abraham see we became it by christ amen
[1:18:49] heirs according to the promise then god
[1:18:51] is just his duty bound to you as he was
[1:18:54] to abraham
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:58] so if he changed abraham's body just as
[1:19:00] duty bound to change our body
[1:19:03] amen
[1:19:05] say see say that would take that should
[1:19:07] take all the scare out of you god don't
[1:19:10] want you to be scared of nothing
[1:19:15] rest solemnly upon what he said
[1:19:19] he said well
[1:19:20] you know uh
[1:19:22] what about
[1:19:24] i just don't know about
[1:19:25] if you can air he said if you can ever
[1:19:27] get the scare
[1:19:28] out of the church
[1:19:31] and let them realize who they are
[1:19:34] and what they are positionally
[1:19:36] he says healing will be the simplest
[1:19:38] message to be preached
[1:19:40] he said but we're scared we're afraid
[1:19:43] he said what is it you don't realize who
[1:19:45] you are
[1:19:48] you're sons and daughters of god not now
[1:19:51] not will be you are now sons and
[1:19:53] daughters of god not way off in the
[1:19:55] future we want sometime in future set in
[1:19:58] heavenly places we're now seated in
[1:20:00] heavenly places well now we're sons and
[1:20:02] daughters of god it does not appear that
[1:20:04] what we shall be in the hymn but we
[1:20:06] shouldn't see him and we'll have a body
[1:20:08] like his but now we are the sons and
[1:20:10] daughters of god a covenant made by
[1:20:12] abraham and to his seed amen see god
[1:20:15] didn't tell abraham if you do this then
[1:20:17] i'll do that if you do this i'll do that
[1:20:19] he said i have already done it
[1:20:22] and we are under the same covenant so we
[1:20:25] can be undisturbed we can be at rest
[1:20:27] because it ain't what i've done is what
[1:20:29] he's already done
[1:20:34] he already paid my my pri the price for
[1:20:36] my healing i don't have to come up with
[1:20:38] the money to pay for it
[1:20:40] i don't have to come up with the money
[1:20:42] amen to pay for my salvation or anybody
[1:20:44] else's salvation it's already been paid
[1:20:47] for he's already done it
[1:20:53] it's time we start looking at sicknesses
[1:20:56] amen with the eye of god and say it's
[1:20:58] already been paid for
[1:21:00] this has already been paid for we ain't
[1:21:02] got a beg we ain't got to plead we ain't
[1:21:05] got to get on our knees and crawl for
[1:21:07] miles we ain't got to get bloody knees
[1:21:09] and bloody hands to get it it's already
[1:21:12] been paid for
[1:21:14] it's already been given to the church of
[1:21:16] the living god
[1:21:27] see healing is not what a man can do
[1:21:30] healing is what god has already done
[1:21:34] salvation is not what a man can do or
[1:21:37] what a church can do that salvation is a
[1:21:39] finished work
[1:21:41] your faith in that finished work that
[1:21:43] christ completed everything
[1:21:45] amen christ redeemed it all back
[1:21:49] he paid it all
[1:21:51] every sin
[1:21:53] every sickness
[1:21:54] ever
[1:21:56] hello cancer you're in that
[1:21:59] every disease has already been paid for
[1:22:03] and right now we see him sitting at the
[1:22:05] right hand of god making intercessions
[1:22:07] upon our profession or our confession no
[1:22:10] matter how much you pray how much you
[1:22:12] cry how much you agonize how much you do
[1:22:15] it won't be accepted god can do nothing
[1:22:18] for you unless you accept it by faith
[1:22:20] first
[1:22:23] say god you already done it
[1:22:26] i'm just here to claim it
[1:22:30] that's the only way god can act now is
[1:22:32] when you act first
[1:22:33] because he's a high priest make an
[1:22:35] intercession upon your confession of
[1:22:36] faith
[1:22:37] in
[1:22:38] his finished work
[1:22:42] that's the basis of divine healing
[1:22:46] he would say again about abraham he said
[1:22:48] see abraham took god's word
[1:22:50] he believed god he called those saints
[1:22:52] which were contrary to the promise god
[1:22:54] gave him he called them as though they
[1:22:56] didn't even look at them
[1:22:57] he took god at his word and when the
[1:23:00] days passed the weeks passed the months
[1:23:02] passed the years passed that didn't faze
[1:23:04] abraham not one bit
[1:23:08] hello
[1:23:10] the scripture said he staggered not at
[1:23:11] the promises of god but was strong in
[1:23:13] the faith
[1:23:15] amen didn't phase him one bit
[1:23:17] amen and everything seemed to every day
[1:23:19] it simply seemed to grow more difficult
[1:23:22] and more difficult and more impossible
[1:23:25] and more impossible but instead of
[1:23:27] getting weaker he got stronger
[1:23:30] job it seemed to get more difficult and
[1:23:33] more impossible and more weaker i mean
[1:23:36] more situations arose and it got worse
[1:23:38] and got worse and got worse but job
[1:23:40] didn't get weaker job got stronger
[1:23:44] amen i believe that there's a bride here
[1:23:46] on the earth it's not getting weaker
[1:23:50] he said where are you brother man we'll
[1:23:51] say we say we're looking at how bad the
[1:23:53] world's getting he said what you need to
[1:23:55] be looking is how powerful the church is
[1:23:57] getting
[1:23:59] and how much more powerful the church is
[1:24:01] today than what it was before
[1:24:04] amen the waves may be getting bigger and
[1:24:07] it may seem like it's getting more
[1:24:08] impossible for a rapture to happen but
[1:24:11] it's going to happen
[1:24:13] not because i said it because he said it
[1:24:16] and if he said it i'll believe it
[1:24:21] so instead of getting weaker we're
[1:24:23] getting stronger
[1:24:25] well these are falling off and that's
[1:24:26] following where they went out from us
[1:24:28] because they wouldn't none of us
[1:24:34] so it makes the church stronger
[1:24:40] difficulties seem to rise
[1:24:42] but god's promised it
[1:24:46] it seems to be more impossible but god's
[1:24:49] promised it
[1:24:50] so instead of instead of cowering back
[1:24:54] we ought to stand more firm than ever
[1:24:58] on thus saith the lord
[1:25:01] it ought to be settled when god says
[1:25:04] something
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:10] it ought to be settled when god says
[1:25:13] something
[1:25:14] well what did he say well read your
[1:25:16] bible
[1:25:20] i'm not saying god can't give dreams i'm
[1:25:22] not saying god don't give vision he
[1:25:24] still does he still gives visitations of
[1:25:27] angels he still does that
[1:25:32] but don't forget god's got a whole chock
[1:25:34] full of promises laying here and he said
[1:25:36] it
[1:25:38] and he always waiting on somebody to say
[1:25:40] you know what
[1:25:41] that's me
[1:25:43] i'm not out here looking in there i'm in
[1:25:45] there
[1:25:47] that's me
[1:25:52] abraham called those things which were
[1:25:54] as though they were not because they
[1:25:56] were contrary to the word so the
[1:25:58] symptoms and the circumstances and the
[1:26:00] problems he didn't pay no attention to
[1:26:02] it
[1:26:06] he just goes on
[1:26:08] you're going down
[1:26:11] i thought this was interesting
[1:26:16] this is a fundamental foundation for
[1:26:18] faith it's a really wonderful
[1:26:20] sermon
[1:26:21] so we hear so many people say well if i
[1:26:23] only had faith
[1:26:25] he said now faith doesn't mean
[1:26:28] long drawn out prayer meetings
[1:26:31] he said it doesn't mean long fast
[1:26:33] faith is an unconscious thing
[1:26:36] your real faith you're unconscious to it
[1:26:38] you don't know that the faith you you
[1:26:40] don't even know the faith you've got
[1:26:43] it says unconscious matter to you could
[1:26:45] you imagine jesus questioning whether he
[1:26:47] had faith or not to stop the wind or
[1:26:49] steal the waves or have faith enough to
[1:26:51] raise lazarus up he never questions his
[1:26:54] faith first thing before we can have
[1:26:56] faith we got to have some foundation for
[1:26:58] faith there has got to be something
[1:27:00] behind it
[1:27:02] so we don't we're not having faith on
[1:27:04] some wisdom whimsical thing some man
[1:27:06] said what's behind our faith is what god
[1:27:09] said
[1:27:14] faith is always there
[1:27:16] and we've got to find faith's resting
[1:27:18] place
[1:27:22] faith is looking for somebody
[1:27:25] that'll grab it and hold on to it
[1:27:27] no matter how
[1:27:29] bad the storms are raining
[1:27:32] brother timothy is bad yeah
[1:27:35] sure is
[1:27:38] you couldn't tell the disciples and
[1:27:39] winds and waves wasn't real
[1:27:42] they was real
[1:27:46] jesus knew they was real
[1:27:49] he knew the dangers of it
[1:27:53] but he also knew the power of the word
[1:27:57] we know the dangers that we're living in
[1:27:59] it's a dangerous time
[1:28:05] just got word today that one of our
[1:28:07] brothers
[1:28:08] just got released
[1:28:11] brother caleb
[1:28:12] just got released from the prison there
[1:28:15] just a few minutes ago
[1:28:28] he's an on-time god
[1:28:32] he's greater than the storms
[1:28:34] god's doing things
[1:28:37] he's moving in impossible situations
[1:28:38] this ain't the time to jump out the boat
[1:28:40] an abandoned ship
[1:28:42] and think it's got too rough it's too
[1:28:44] bad it's too deep it's too this is too
[1:28:46] that no
[1:28:47] it's the time god steps to the bow of
[1:28:49] the boat
[1:28:50] and he says peace be still
[1:28:54] do you know the peace be still i'm
[1:28:55] looking for
[1:28:57] is there one bright and shining morning
[1:29:01] you're talking about peace

[1:29:04] brow of eternity and he says peace be
[1:29:07] still
[1:29:08] and all of our wars and all of our
[1:29:10] strife that we've been through in our
[1:29:12] sicknesses and the things that we've
[1:29:13] been carrying and fighting just all
[1:29:15] melts away
[1:29:19] think on them things for a moment

[1:29:29] my favorite quotes and i i i this this
