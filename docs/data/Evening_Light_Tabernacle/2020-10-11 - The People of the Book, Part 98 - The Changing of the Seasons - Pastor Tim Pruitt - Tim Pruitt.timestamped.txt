[44:02] amen 2020 i told you is a year of
[44:06] miracles
[44:08] where it has been necessary that the
[44:10] faith that we have been taught
[44:12] is put to work if faith is
[44:16] must not remain dormant and god's been
[44:19] giving you an opportunity to exercise
[44:21] that faith
[44:23] to learn to move in the spirit to
[44:25] realize
[44:27] you can be like daniel and stand alone
[44:31] you can be like the hebrew children have
[44:33] to face a fire alone just
[44:36] three three young men daniel somewhere
[44:38] else
[44:39] must been in another part of the kingdom
[44:42] but anyway

[51:14] many more will as we resume our services
[51:18] i will i will say this
[51:21] as we go forward we have no plans to
[51:24] do this again to shut down services for
[51:27] time
[51:28] um we um we will just go ahead and
[51:32] persevere through whatever we go through
[51:35] amen amen and you know
[51:39] i mean you know those that are fearful

[51:43] um the rest of us will just come on and

[51:50] amen because he says the lord thy god is
[51:54] with thee
[51:55] i'm in the midst of israel and i am the
[51:58] lord your god
[51:59] so we're here in a wonderful time in a
[52:02] moment
[52:03] and you've had moments and opportunities
[52:07] where that your your faith has been
[52:10] exercised
[52:11] we have been through some great battles
[52:15] some of us have been in the hospital
[52:18] thankfully we have lost none
[52:21] that have um passed on we have sister
[52:24] churches that have
[52:26] had preachers past our ministers in
[52:29] their church that
[52:31] passed on and we've had those that had
[52:34] deacons that have been long-time elders
[52:37] in the church
[52:38] that passed on and so we we
[52:41] have faced a formidable enemy but
[52:44] none of it none of it has not been
[52:47] without
[52:48] god's provision and also knowing that
[52:52] god's will
[52:53] rules over it all and i say to those
[52:56] that have lost family members it's that
[52:59] maybe you're
[53:00] listening in today and you've lost
[53:02] family members or friends or whatever
[53:04] in your churches god bless you and may
[53:07] god comfort you
[53:08] and god give you strength but it's not
[53:11] all lost
[53:12] amen they're healed they're in a new
[53:14] body
[53:15] they're rejoicing on the other side
[53:18] waiting for us to come
[53:21] i'm going to be speaking today on the
[53:22] changing of the seasons and
[53:25] as you can see on our screen today that
[53:29] but the word of the lord stands forever
[53:32] so no matter what changes in
[53:35] seasons or even progressions that are
[53:38] made
[53:38] the word of god always stands forever
[53:42] it's always constant is there for us
[53:45] to have as an absolute and an assurance
[53:49] and that's where we must take our and
[53:51] place our faith today is an assurance of
[53:53] god's word
[53:55] now i wanted to share a little quotation
[53:58] as we went along i i thought of this
[54:02] as i took this title and
[54:05] said brother branham told us in a
[54:07] testimony of a true witness
[54:09] so if we are christian and we're born of
[54:12] the spirit
[54:13] death can hold nothing but victory for
[54:16] us because this so corruptible body that
[54:20] satan still has power over will drop in
[54:23] the dust of the earth
[54:25] but when that season he says this is the
[54:28] wrong season now
[54:29] this is mortal season but
[54:34] but immortal season is coming
[54:38] when the immortal one comes he will
[54:40] bring with him
[54:41] the immortal spirits that is returned
[54:44] to him from the earth and they will come
[54:47] forth again
[54:48] in the resurrection for the great
[54:50] millennium
[54:52] and shall shine in his glory
[54:55] and as i was praying this past wednesday
[54:58] morning
[54:59] and thinking about these things and
[55:02] even the translations of the saints
[55:06] and and um and even the the approaching
[55:11] translation of the bride of christ is i
[55:13] believe we are
[55:14] nearer now than we've ever been we've
[55:16] run out of church ages
[55:18] we're at the end of the ages and
[55:21] you know time is about to end for us
[55:25] as we move into eternity time will
[55:27] continue on
[55:28] on the earth for the thousand-year
[55:30] millennial reign and
[55:31] of course the time of the tribulation
[55:34] they'll all be in time
[55:36] until that morning breaks eternal bright
[55:40] and fair
[55:41] where that we um know the new heavens
[55:44] and the earth will come and
[55:46] the earth will move back from time into
[55:49] eternity
[55:50] but as i was praying wednesday morning i
[55:53] envisioned us
[55:54] putting on our new bodies like children
[55:58] putting on new clothes
[56:00] and dancing and shouting about how we
[56:03] look
[56:04] and we feel in them giggling and crying
[56:07] and laughing
[56:08] and dancing around like kids and talking
[56:11] excitedly
[56:12] about how we look and then embracing and
[56:15] dancing around with those that have gone
[56:18] on before us
[56:19] and seeing them in their new clothes
[56:22] i can remember you know as a young boy i
[56:25] only had a
[56:26] pair of cowboy boots once in my life and
[56:29] that
[56:30] was about when i was about eight years
[56:33] old and my parents
[56:34] i could wear a pair of cowboy boots and
[56:37] i remember prancing around in them
[56:39] and showing off my new boots but that
[56:42] ain't gonna be nothing like what it'll
[56:44] be that day
[56:45] when i show off my new body amen when we
[56:49] look around
[56:50] and sickness and old age and
[56:53] and problems of life just fade away into
[56:57] oblivion
[56:58] and we'd move into that realm of the
[57:01] eternal youth
[57:05] now we know that we're living in a time
[57:09] where
[57:09] great darkness is sweeping over the
[57:12] earth we can
[57:13] feel this darkness it's so thick
[57:17] it's a it's an awful day that we're
[57:19] living in but yet
[57:20] it's a tremendous day all the same time
[57:23] because we are living in the time of the
[57:25] fulfillment of scripture
[57:27] where the word of god is being
[57:29] manifested to an end time
[57:31] people and the people are being put on
[57:34] display
[57:36] and and this great darkness swinging
[57:38] over the earth now
[57:40] is it is only declaring that there
[57:44] is a great light that is pressing down
[57:48] and that we are about to change the
[57:51] seasons and that's what i'm going to
[57:53] speak on today
[57:54] as we move from this time and this realm
[57:57] of darkness into into the light
[58:01] of god's word and promise
[58:04] he said this is a time right now where
[58:07] death is hanging
[58:08] close that it could be within an hour
[58:11] and we can speak of that
[58:12] as we look at the dying of freedom in
[58:16] america
[58:17] when we look at anarchy on every side
[58:21] and
[58:21] troubles on every hand like never before
[58:26] so we're living in a time where we we
[58:28] see
[58:29] the dying of the lamb and the birth of a
[58:33] dragon
[58:34] as america begins to turn from
[58:37] a lamb with freedom of religion
[58:41] into a dragon and i'm not gonna go
[58:44] in some rhetoric of my politics today
[58:48] and
[58:49] and say well you need to get out and
[58:51] vote
[58:52] i was praying about all of that the
[58:53] other day and i'll be honest with you
[58:56] i want to who i i'll tell you who i want
[58:58] to win
[58:59] i want the man to win who will usher in
[59:02] the end time in a greater depth than
[59:05] ever
[59:06] because i'm ready to go home
[59:08] [Music]
[59:09] amen oh i really don't want the man to
[59:12] get in there that will
[59:14] um that will perpetuate things and make
[59:18] things a little
[59:19] nicer for a little while longer i'm
[59:21] ready to leave this world
[59:24] amen we have we have marked a lot of
[59:26] time
[59:28] we have been through the ages
[59:31] and i'm longing for jesus to come back
[59:34] and you may be screaming i'll wait a
[59:36] little longer please jesus i got loved
[59:38] ones i'll tell you
[59:40] friends it comes a time where that you
[59:42] will say
[59:43] even so come lord jesus
[59:46] whatever you have to do just don't leave
[59:48] us while we're out
[59:50] amen but bring up bring about an end
[59:54] to struggling world and struggling
[59:56] nature
[59:58] we're here at the at a time as i said
[1:00:00] where death
[1:00:01] is hanging so close that it could be
[1:00:04] within an
[1:00:04] hour hey man we we're threatened with
[1:00:08] with with china rising up and communism
[1:00:12] and
[1:00:12] and we're and even in our own country in
[1:00:15] anarchy and
[1:00:16] and every kind of movement until
[1:00:19] there's never been such a time of
[1:00:21] confusing
[1:00:23] in darkness amen and
[1:00:26] nobody's got an answer nobody has the
[1:00:30] answer for it
[1:00:31] but you see if if death is hanging that
[1:00:35] close
[1:00:36] you see then life has to be hanging
[1:00:39] that close in fact you know it's the
[1:00:42] coming of the light that could gels the
[1:00:45] darkness
[1:00:46] i mean this is why there's darkness just
[1:00:48] before the dawn and it gets
[1:00:50] darker than ever it's because the coming
[1:00:53] light is
[1:00:54] pressing drop us back
[1:00:59] and it's hanging low life is hanging low
[1:01:02] it's coming down
[1:01:04] in our dimension we've had things happen
[1:01:07] in this layout laodicean age that has
[1:01:10] never happened in the other ages except
[1:01:13] the first
[1:01:14] we're here in a time where the great
[1:01:17] holy spirit is
[1:01:19] moving in and it's restored back to us
[1:01:22] the original
[1:01:22] baptism of the holy ghost the true
[1:01:25] token the abstract amend that
[1:01:29] the same thing that they had on the day
[1:01:31] of pentecost
[1:01:33] not a measure of faith not a measure of
[1:01:36] truth but the full truth not a measure
[1:01:39] of the spirit such as justification or
[1:01:42] sanctification but
[1:01:44] the fullness of the spirit where that we
[1:01:47] can
[1:01:47] walk in the in the fullness of the light
[1:01:50] of the world the great holy spirit is
[1:01:53] moving in and darkness is taking this
[1:01:56] last toll
[1:01:58] amen but christ will come because the
[1:02:01] light will
[1:02:02] soon be here it doesn't take much light
[1:02:06] ain't meant to shine in darkness and to
[1:02:09] push
[1:02:10] darkness back we get to close the doors
[1:02:13] and shut off all the artificial light
[1:02:16] and strike one match
[1:02:17] and it would so illuminate among the
[1:02:21] word that it is close to
[1:02:22] everybody in the room from the forest
[1:02:25] furthest one back would see
[1:02:27] that light shining amen and
[1:02:30] it tells us that the word of god
[1:02:33] will abide it forever and the great holy
[1:02:37] spirit is
[1:02:37] moving in and darkness taking this last
[1:02:40] toll
[1:02:41] because the light will soon be here
[1:02:45] and christ will come and the joy and the
[1:02:48] hope of the ages
[1:02:50] for a real resurrection of the saints
[1:02:53] amen for all believers for we will
[1:02:56] share with him in his resurrection as we
[1:02:59] shared with him in his suffering
[1:03:02] he that suffers with me will reign with
[1:03:05] me
[1:03:06] so don't be surprised you've been
[1:03:08] through a bit of suffering
[1:03:10] amen should we be carried to the skies
[1:03:14] or
[1:03:14] into the heavens on a flowery bed of
[1:03:17] ease when others fought to win the prize
[1:03:19] and sailed through bloody seas and the
[1:03:22] psalm the psalmist said no
[1:03:24] i must fight if i must reign
[1:03:28] increase my courage lord so that's a
[1:03:31] prayer we can't go forth
[1:03:32] as a coward we cannot just go around
[1:03:35] daily with our head hanging down
[1:03:39] i mean don't don't live in the in
[1:03:42] anxiety
[1:03:42] when the scripture says over and over
[1:03:44] again fear not
[1:03:47] even when he says i'm with you wherever
[1:03:49] you go
[1:03:51] amen i'll never fail you i will be with
[1:03:53] you
[1:03:54] even in you to the end of the world why
[1:03:56] live under
[1:03:57] and be captive to anxiety when we can
[1:04:01] when we can walk as as christians
[1:04:04] looking at the promise of god oh my when
[1:04:07] we look at the world and they're
[1:04:09] carrying on the darkness that is going
[1:04:11] on we can raise our head
[1:04:13] and hear congregate today as eagles
[1:04:17] amen and knowing this that we know him
[1:04:20] in the power of his resurrection
[1:04:23] amen because that he lives we shall live
[1:04:25] also
[1:04:27] amen you see that's what it means to us
[1:04:30] as believers
[1:04:31] we are part of his resurrection
[1:04:35] you know as we think back
[1:04:38] you know they they have times of
[1:04:40] passover
[1:04:41] and like like easter time and which is
[1:04:44] passover
[1:04:46] it was a harvest season it was a time
[1:04:48] when the barley
[1:04:50] would become ripe and with it would come
[1:04:53] a
[1:04:53] celebration later in our month of may
[1:04:58] is another harvest season where the
[1:05:00] wheat becomes ripe
[1:05:02] and this would happen seven weeks after
[1:05:06] um after the passover
[1:05:09] at pentecost and this is our season we
[1:05:13] are in the season of pentecost
[1:05:17] amen because we have come through the
[1:05:19] the seven
[1:05:20] weeks or the seven ages which that
[1:05:23] typed and this is a time where the day
[1:05:26] of pentecost
[1:05:27] is fully coming it's a jubilee
[1:05:32] a man and all the types of the bible
[1:05:35] have pointed to our day into our hour
[1:05:39] amen and every type in the bible again
[1:05:42] is here again but this time in
[1:05:44] fulfillment
[1:05:46] we are we're here even to an easter
[1:05:49] even to a passover even to
[1:05:53] a pentecost even to um
[1:05:56] the feast of the tabernacles everything
[1:05:59] is coming
[1:06:00] right into fruition at this time
[1:06:03] every type of the bible is heading up
[1:06:05] into our
[1:06:06] hour in our time now remember
[1:06:09] type is is a shadow so it's
[1:06:13] it's something that is coming and the
[1:06:16] and the light is coming from down from
[1:06:18] the light and as it comes down
[1:06:21] it casts a shadow and as
[1:06:24] it casts a shadow it's prophesying and
[1:06:27] foretelling
[1:06:28] what it will be like when the actual
[1:06:30] thing comes
[1:06:32] are you with me amen and so this is this
[1:06:35] is where we're at
[1:06:36] we're with all the angels that
[1:06:38] prophesied of us
[1:06:40] all the angels are spoke of this time
[1:06:43] and i'll tell you today that all the
[1:06:45] ages
[1:06:46] all of them that are going for before us
[1:06:48] are
[1:06:49] are depending on us they are waiting on
[1:06:52] us to fulfill and to finish
[1:06:55] this race so there is a great
[1:06:58] responsibility
[1:07:00] that is upon our shoulders this morning
[1:07:03] as we
[1:07:03] face the end time prophecies
[1:07:06] now and it is the rising of the sun
[1:07:10] when brother branham first talks about a
[1:07:12] bright age and we do believe we're in a
[1:07:14] bright age
[1:07:15] we're here in the laodicean age but it
[1:07:18] is the bright age
[1:07:19] it is a time when it is a an era of time
[1:07:23] within the last age
[1:07:24] where it moved from the azusa street
[1:07:28] under a movement in where that they were
[1:07:31] they were the the the ones that god was
[1:07:34] using to where now
[1:07:35] god is calling the bride out of every
[1:07:38] denomination
[1:07:39] back to the word again are you with me
[1:07:43] amen so he says for the bright age it
[1:07:45] will be a resurrection
[1:07:47] out of dark denominationalism will be a
[1:07:49] message
[1:07:51] and here's our message that the full
[1:07:54] maturity of the word has turned back
[1:07:57] in full power and being waved over the
[1:08:00] people by the same
[1:08:02] signs and wonders that he did back there
[1:08:05] so here's our message today we know what
[1:08:07] the message is
[1:08:08] the full maturity of the word has come
[1:08:10] back
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:12] amen the season has changed until
[1:08:16] that in this changing of the season is
[1:08:18] now a time of harvest
[1:08:21] it's a time of ripening it's a time of a
[1:08:24] mature
[1:08:24] church of an elect lady of a people who
[1:08:28] knows who they are
[1:08:29] of an adopted church who knows their
[1:08:34] [Applause]
[1:08:36] position
[1:08:38] and have the same signs and wonders that
[1:08:41] he did back there
[1:08:42] because i live speaking to his wife he
[1:08:45] shall live also
[1:08:47] what a resurrection that was and what a
[1:08:49] resurrection
[1:08:50] this is to be quickened from the dead to
[1:08:53] be a made alive in christ jesus
[1:08:56] by god's quickening power if we look at
[1:09:00] that for a moment i want to just
[1:09:01] say to you as brother branham looked at
[1:09:04] this season
[1:09:06] he would call it even an easter season a
[1:09:09] resurrection season
[1:09:11] it's a time where resurrection life is
[1:09:13] here
[1:09:14] it is a time of great restoration
[1:09:18] is a time of restoring all the truths
[1:09:21] that were lost
[1:09:22] and all the power that was lost and all
[1:09:24] the anointing that was lost
[1:09:27] down through the ages of being restored
[1:09:29] back to the last
[1:09:30] age and that's what brother branham
[1:09:32] would say that christ
[1:09:34] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:36] and we're seeing the hour we're living
[1:09:38] in
[1:09:39] we need an easter in the church
[1:09:41] resurrection we need a resurrection
[1:09:44] to power faith amen men and women to
[1:09:47] stand out for what which is god's
[1:09:50] vindicated word hallelujah
[1:09:54] amen since a resurrection hour
[1:09:58] the brother brandon said we needed
[1:10:02] it's a restoration hour universe
[1:10:05] resurrection is a restoration
[1:10:09] it's a restoring back to life but it's
[1:10:11] even more
[1:10:13] because it brings them back and man
[1:10:16] when jesus raised he didn't raise a a
[1:10:20] a a a body that was wounded and horribly
[1:10:23] disfigured
[1:10:24] he rose alive
[1:10:28] so changed till they on the way to
[1:10:30] emmaus
[1:10:31] did not recognize him in his new
[1:10:33] condition
[1:10:35] amen amen and that's where you're going
[1:10:38] to raise
[1:10:39] that's the way you're going to be
[1:10:40] changed
[1:10:43] i mean when we all get together and we
[1:10:45] begin to travel like a thought and come
[1:10:48] from place to place and
[1:10:49] visit home to home to home to home and
[1:10:52] we see one another some of us
[1:10:53] i'm gonna have to introduce myself to
[1:10:56] some of them i'm going to have to ask
[1:10:58] them to introduce their self
[1:11:01] amen i'm going to have to say you're
[1:11:03] brother elle
[1:11:04] oh yeah your brother el well words of
[1:11:06] glasses don't need them
[1:11:08] hey man look at my hair look at my new
[1:11:12] body
[1:11:13] oh man look how i can run amen look i
[1:11:16] look at my strengths
[1:11:18] look at my youth
[1:11:22] hallelujah amen we're gonna look around
[1:11:25] at one another
[1:11:26] and i'll see some of you like i've never
[1:11:28] seen you before
[1:11:29] [Applause]
[1:11:31] hallelujah with eyes that never saw like
[1:11:34] them eyes
[1:11:35] a man that can see in between the
[1:11:38] dimensions
[1:11:43] we're here at the changing of the season
[1:11:47] in a resurrection hour
[1:11:53] brother branham uses the word essence
[1:11:56] it's the nature of something that
[1:11:58] determines a character
[1:12:00] its character or the property of
[1:12:02] something without
[1:12:03] which it would not exist to be what it
[1:12:05] is
[1:12:07] here then is the essence of the
[1:12:09] resurrection the properties of it
[1:12:11] the resurrection shows and proves that
[1:12:14] jesus is not dead
[1:12:16] but he's alive as he said in the easter
[1:12:20] seal the very essence of this
[1:12:22] resurrection is to tell and to show
[1:12:25] and to prove that jesus has raised from
[1:12:28] the dead
[1:12:29] amen and he's not dead he's a living
[1:12:33] i can remember you know the different
[1:12:35] ones he would appear
[1:12:36] to mary magdalene he would appear to the
[1:12:39] other women at the tomb
[1:12:41] he would appear to peter he would appear
[1:12:43] to the disciples
[1:12:44] he would appear to thomas had to get him
[1:12:47] on board
[1:12:48] get him away from his unbelieving
[1:12:51] attitude that he had come on amen to
[1:12:54] where he would scream out those
[1:12:56] notable words my lord and my god
[1:13:00] amen amen that's what god would do he's
[1:13:03] not going to leave a predestinated
[1:13:05] even a doubting thomas
[1:13:09] he ain't going to leave them behind
[1:13:11] he'll come and he'll show it
[1:13:13] come on he'll show up to reveal itself
[1:13:16] to get you on board
[1:13:19] amen how many would say oh god show up
[1:13:21] to me today get me on board
[1:13:23] get me past my unbelief get me past this
[1:13:26] darkness
[1:13:27] let me see clearly what you're doing in
[1:13:29] this hour
[1:13:36] he would appear he would appear
[1:13:40] to them on the road to them of emmaus
[1:13:44] he would appear and paul would say and
[1:13:47] he appeared to me
[1:13:52] hallelujah and i didn't want to say
[1:13:55] and he's appeared to me
[1:13:59] amen and blessed are those that love his
[1:14:02] appearing
[1:14:04] and he appeared to you and to you and
[1:14:06] he's appeared to you and to you
[1:14:08] and he's appeared to you and that to you
[1:14:10] and you know he's alive
[1:14:13] and our message is he's appeared to me
[1:14:16] and he's not a dead god he's not a god
[1:14:19] of history
[1:14:20] he's the god of the presence
[1:14:24] hallelujah because he's appeared to me
[1:14:29] so that's the essence of the message
[1:14:32] remember because it's a resurrection
[1:14:34] message
[1:14:35] where it tells the suffer the weary
[1:14:38] the downtrodden to stand and be healed
[1:14:43] amen it assures them that we are the
[1:14:46] resurrection
[1:14:47] and the life come on now
[1:14:50] i didn't say he yes though yes
[1:14:54] but you are now the resurrection
[1:14:57] and you are now the life it dwells in
[1:15:01] you
[1:15:01] amen oh yes i was once dead
[1:15:05] in sins and trespasses but now i'm alive
[1:15:09] forevermore
[1:15:12] and i've got the keys to death and of
[1:15:14] hell
[1:15:16] amen satan's eden cannot lock me in
[1:15:19] i've got the keys to death in hell
[1:15:22] hell cannot hold its gates against me i
[1:15:25] got the keys to it
[1:15:29] you know what happened when god gave you
[1:15:31] the keys to that
[1:15:32] alcohol amen to that pornography
[1:15:36] to those demons that were holding you
[1:15:38] back you know what it was
[1:15:40] when he took drugs out of your life you
[1:15:42] know what it was when he took sin out of
[1:15:44] your life
[1:15:45] whatever it was he gave you the key to
[1:15:48] it
[1:15:48] and i'll tell you today no devil
[1:15:54] no habit no problem
[1:15:57] no weapon can stop you from going
[1:16:00] through that gate
[1:16:02] because the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:16:05] against this church
[1:16:11] it's the essence of our message
[1:16:17] it's not a dead message it's not a
[1:16:20] message of death
[1:16:22] it's a message of life
[1:16:26] goodness tell that clock
[1:16:30] what being so busy come on amen
[1:16:34] now it assures me it shows
[1:16:38] others that we are the resurrection
[1:16:41] and the life it's not a dead message
[1:16:45] but one of life it's the message
[1:16:49] of the resurrected
[1:16:52] are you with me without this property or
[1:16:56] essence
[1:16:57] the message is dead
[1:17:00] it's worthless but this message declares
[1:17:04] that it's a message of life it declares
[1:17:08] the healer
[1:17:09] the deliverer has conquered death and
[1:17:12] that we
[1:17:12] are beneficiaries of his resurrection
[1:17:17] as he said in the rising of the sun now
[1:17:20] the very essence
[1:17:21] are the properties of the message that
[1:17:24] was sent
[1:17:25] that he has risen from the dead and we
[1:17:28] are his beneficiaries
[1:17:30] we share the resurrection with him and
[1:17:32] draw
[1:17:33] benefits from them from this
[1:17:36] by proving to the world that he's alive
[1:17:39] and we cannot do it by word only
[1:17:47] we cannot do it by some tradition of man
[1:17:50] we can only reflect we only reflect
[1:17:53] exactly
[1:17:54] what we're pointing to so if we're
[1:17:57] pointing to
[1:17:58] that he's alive it's going to reflect
[1:18:00] back in us that he's alive
[1:18:02] if we point to that he's the healer and
[1:18:05] was wounded by our transgression
[1:18:07] we're going to reflect back that he is
[1:18:10] the healer
[1:18:13] hallelujah you see the absence of the
[1:18:17] message
[1:18:17] the properties of the message that was
[1:18:20] sent
[1:18:20] if he's risen
[1:18:27] he would say about that easter i've
[1:18:30] stamped it on my heart as the greatest
[1:18:32] event of the year
[1:18:34] it's a resurrection time why am i
[1:18:37] talking about easter now it's october
[1:18:40] because we are in an easter season
[1:18:44] we're in a restoration hour
[1:18:47] amen you see seasons can change here the
[1:18:51] grass will wither and the flowers fade
[1:18:54] and we can look and we can see now that
[1:18:58] this fall starts coming in and the color
[1:19:00] starts
[1:19:01] changing and the leaves will start
[1:19:03] falling and it will
[1:19:04] go down to death but the word of god
[1:19:06] doesn't change
[1:19:08] and god's word declares that this is the
[1:19:11] greatest
[1:19:12] event of all time
[1:19:21] we're in another resurrection hour
[1:19:26] and god still rolls the stone and
[1:19:30] the angel sat upon it
[1:19:33] and there is no devil and no power
[1:19:37] that's going to roll that stone back in
[1:19:39] place
[1:19:41] [Music]
[1:19:43] amen you think about it for a moment the
[1:19:46] angel of god came
[1:19:48] when the stone was rolled back he rolled
[1:19:51] it back and he sat on
[1:19:52] it and there wasn't a government big
[1:19:56] enough
[1:19:58] there wasn't legislation that was big
[1:20:01] enough
[1:20:02] there was in roman soldiers and
[1:20:04] courterians of soldiers
[1:20:06] that could stop it
[1:20:09] come on church because the angels sat
[1:20:12] upon the stone
[1:20:15] and i'll tell you he's still sitting on
[1:20:17] that stone today
[1:20:19] he's making sure that nobody puts christ
[1:20:22] back in the tomb again
[1:20:26] let's go back in thinking for a moment
[1:20:28] they've been great men's prophets
[1:20:30] teachers kings leaders but finally they
[1:20:32] they arrive for mankind to be delivered
[1:20:35] from the tyranny of sin
[1:20:37] same is true today we come to another
[1:20:40] time just like that
[1:20:41] the you know there have been great moves
[1:20:43] of the past
[1:20:45] there's been the lutherans wesley
[1:20:48] finney moody smith wigglesworth
[1:20:52] f bosworth and more i mean time would
[1:20:55] fail us to call all the names of the
[1:20:57] great men
[1:20:58] that god is used in the past
[1:21:01] but there must come a season
[1:21:05] where where the church moves in the
[1:21:07] power of the resurrection
[1:21:10] where the fullness of the promises may
[1:21:12] manifest
[1:21:14] just like brother branham said at the
[1:21:15] church today as he compared the bride
[1:21:18] with the church as two cars both are
[1:21:21] shiny both right off the assembly
[1:21:23] line both filled with gas of the highest
[1:21:26] octane
[1:21:27] but one with mechanics only a great
[1:21:30] machine
[1:21:31] but no dynamics and the other with both
[1:21:34] dynamics and mechanics and this is why
[1:21:38] you would say there has been churches
[1:21:40] churches brides prides but there will
[1:21:43] come one
[1:21:44] that will be the word
[1:21:47] amen there's got to come a real bride
[1:21:49] that's not only got the mechanics
[1:21:52] but the dynamics of it amen oh my not
[1:21:56] just some
[1:21:57] some car with a polishing job and a
[1:22:00] beautiful finish
[1:22:01] and you can see yourself as it mirrors
[1:22:04] your image back as you approach it
[1:22:06] and all this stuff it's so classy and
[1:22:08] beautiful and this stained glass windows
[1:22:10] and it's high spears and it's sitting
[1:22:13] there oh my
[1:22:14] cold is a morgue it's never started
[1:22:19] the days of starting has passed
[1:22:22] it won't crank
[1:22:25] amen now but there's another new car
[1:22:31] that has just come out in this last day
[1:22:34] and it's rolled off of god's assembly
[1:22:36] line and he took luther's message and
[1:22:39] wesley's message and pentecostal message
[1:22:42] and i finally bring it back to oh my
[1:22:45] goodness it looks exactly like
[1:22:47] that old antique paul's message
[1:22:52] hallelujah and it shines and glows
[1:22:55] with the glory of god on it
[1:22:59] and it'll drive down the healing it'll
[1:23:01] drive to miracles
[1:23:03] it'll tie to salvation it'll drive
[1:23:06] hallelujah to deliverance
[1:23:13] they've been great prophets every one of
[1:23:16] them died before us
[1:23:20] there have been great prophets before
[1:23:21] jesus never one of them
[1:23:24] would just about without fail almost all
[1:23:27] of them would go down to the grave
[1:23:29] except for an enoch and an elijah
[1:23:34] have been prophets on earth that even
[1:23:37] healed the sick
[1:23:38] raised the dead they did great signs
[1:23:43] but when jesus rose from the dead he
[1:23:46] authenticated the word of god forever
[1:23:50] and every gloom and doubt was shattered
[1:23:54] amen man had been shut up in the prison
[1:23:57] house
[1:23:58] even religious people of this of his day
[1:24:02] been great religious moves and when a
[1:24:04] man died he just seemed to settle it you
[1:24:06] know moses died
[1:24:08] seemed to just nullified everything he
[1:24:10] said joshua died
[1:24:11] israel wasn't doing what every man
[1:24:13] thought was right in his own eyes
[1:24:16] but when this one came he said i have
[1:24:19] the power to lay my life down
[1:24:22] and to raise it up again amen
[1:24:25] and of course he he proved that when he
[1:24:28] raised from the dead
[1:24:30] and that seals it for us we
[1:24:33] know that when he raised he raised and
[1:24:36] conquered
[1:24:37] every sickness every disease every sin
[1:24:43] the days of jesus was a very
[1:24:45] supernatural time
[1:24:47] where heaven was pouring out a message
[1:24:52] angels had appeared think of that
[1:24:55] after years and years of silence
[1:24:58] here angels appeared to zechariah and
[1:25:01] then to mary
[1:25:02] and then the inspiration came from the
[1:25:04] angel's visitation
[1:25:06] it would hit elizabeth and mary and anna
[1:25:10] and simeon and they would prophesy about
[1:25:13] what god was doing
[1:25:14] and then it would come on joseph and the
[1:25:17] angels would come and
[1:25:19] and break through the dimensions to
[1:25:22] shepherds
[1:25:24] amen and john comes on the scene as a
[1:25:26] forerunner
[1:25:27] and he's announcing there's one among
[1:25:29] you and he's here
[1:25:32] amen he's here somewhere standing among
[1:25:35] you somewhere
[1:25:36] and then a light like a job then
[1:25:39] come down and a voice out of heaven
[1:25:43] and then it would come to decreasing of
[1:25:45] that messenger
[1:25:46] that forerunner as he would move off the
[1:25:49] scene
[1:25:50] and the message was now in flesh
[1:25:54] as jesus demonstrated god to the world
[1:25:58] amen what was it it changed from the
[1:26:02] prophet
[1:26:03] john to his prophecy jesus
[1:26:07] these junctions are so hard for people
[1:26:10] the changing of seasons is difficult
[1:26:14] you find people like in acts 19 who who
[1:26:17] were good people but missed the junction
[1:26:20] there were disciples of john but didn't
[1:26:22] know of jesus and his resurrection
[1:26:25] they were baptized of john but didn't
[1:26:27] know who he pointed to
[1:26:29] they idolized the prophet they idolized
[1:26:32] his boldness
[1:26:33] they thought they were ready for the
[1:26:35] messiah but they didn't know the messiah
[1:26:38] had come
[1:26:40] and was crying had been crucified and
[1:26:42] ascended
[1:26:43] and sent back his holy spirit and
[1:26:45] changed forms again
[1:26:47] and that now he was on earth
[1:26:51] the messiah was on earth in a
[1:26:54] multi-member
[1:26:54] body of his church amen
[1:26:58] oh brothers we hear them still talking
[1:27:01] about brother branham today
[1:27:03] who like john the forerunner brought a
[1:27:05] message
[1:27:07] they're still enamored infatuated to the
[1:27:09] point of enchantment
[1:27:12] about the forerunner amen
[1:27:15] and if they've never seen the one he was
[1:27:18] pointing to and that's even true about
[1:27:22] jesus people
[1:27:23] are enchanted about the man of galilee
[1:27:26] they're talking about
[1:27:27] the resurrection but if jesus listen to
[1:27:30] me now
[1:27:31] if jesus had only raised from the dead
[1:27:34] and and and completed and that completed
[1:27:38] everything we would still be in our sins
[1:27:42] that resurrection power had to come in
[1:27:45] the hearts of god's children
[1:27:48] amen it wasn't enough for it to be in
[1:27:50] jesus
[1:27:51] it had to be in his people
[1:27:54] amen every believer has to participate
[1:27:58] in his resurrection and become the
[1:28:01] resurrection also
[1:28:03] amen not to not just to know that he
[1:28:06] rose from the dead but no
[1:28:07] they had risen with him and that's what
[1:28:09] jesus pointed to
[1:28:11] go to the city of jerusalem and wait
[1:28:14] until you're endued with power from on
[1:28:16] high
[1:28:17] amen i you know we we have we have
[1:28:20] um a church just down this the road from
[1:28:24] where i live
[1:28:26] and and they're nice people lovely
[1:28:28] people a baptist church
[1:28:30] but they have on their signs we preach
[1:28:33] christ and him crucified
[1:28:37] and that's all that's on their side we
[1:28:40] preach
[1:28:40] christ and him crucify i want you to say
[1:28:45] why preach the dead christ
[1:28:49] amen we preached that christ rose from
[1:28:51] the dead
[1:28:54] amen that he was seen of 500.
[1:28:57] sent it up in heaven and not only that
[1:29:00] but he's here today because he came back
[1:29:02] again on the day of pentecost
[1:29:04] the same yesterday today and forever we
[1:29:07] preach a christ that's alive
[1:29:11] not just of christ crucified that's only
[1:29:14] part of the gospel
[1:29:16] not even just christ resurrected that's
[1:29:19] still only a part
[1:29:20] but a christ that came again
[1:29:25] a christ that now dwells in you
[1:29:30] jesus was rejected by the by the church
[1:29:33] world
[1:29:34] he was put in a tomb on the third day he
[1:29:37] rose
[1:29:38] bringing with him the old testament
[1:29:40] saints he ascended with them
[1:29:43] into glory 50 days after his crucifixion
[1:29:47] in the past over there his holy spirit
[1:29:49] came on what we call the day of
[1:29:51] pentecost
[1:29:53] there in the upper room the resurrection
[1:29:56] happened again the quiz acquaintance
[1:29:59] power struck 120
[1:30:02] and they were filled with the spirit of
[1:30:04] jesus
[1:30:05] the holy ghost now god was in his church
[1:30:09] a man and his church was the body that
[1:30:11] he was working through
[1:30:13] and now that same jesus was working
[1:30:16] through a
[1:30:17] multi-member body amen doing the same
[1:30:20] works that he did and they were
[1:30:22] resurrection from
[1:30:23] death unto life it was a spiritual
[1:30:26] resurrection
[1:30:27] ephesians 2 and 5 said even when we were
[1:30:30] dead in sins
[1:30:31] hath he quickened us together that means
[1:30:34] he made us alive
[1:30:36] by with christ for by grace of your sake
[1:30:39] and he raised us up together and made us
[1:30:42] to sit in heavenly places
[1:30:44] in christ jesus these were more
[1:30:48] anointed my science they did the works
[1:30:51] that jesus did
[1:30:53] for they were filled with jesus but
[1:30:56] unfortunately the second eve
[1:30:58] who caller the church did what the first
[1:31:00] team did
[1:31:02] satan got into the book of acts church
[1:31:05] he come in saying we don't need shouting
[1:31:08] we don't need speakers with tongues and
[1:31:11] soon
[1:31:11] begin to tweak the gospel until god was
[1:31:15] no longer one
[1:31:16] but three no longer was jesus the
[1:31:19] intercessor but
[1:31:20] mary no longer were the days of miracles
[1:31:24] present
[1:31:25] but something of the past and soon the
[1:31:28] real experience
[1:31:29] of the baptism of the holy ghost was
[1:31:31] lost from the church
[1:31:33] and the power was gone and the church
[1:31:35] plotted along with dead forms
[1:31:38] as they put christ back in the tomb
[1:31:44] then it came to age of reformation
[1:31:47] with lutzer wesley and azusa street
[1:31:54] remember they were under the mayonnaise
[1:31:59] we're in the eagle age there's a change
[1:32:01] in the season
[1:32:04] the season was changing
[1:32:08] suddenly that comes on the scene one
[1:32:11] like john the baptist
[1:32:13] he's a forerunner he has a ministry of
[1:32:17] elijah
[1:32:19] but also the ministry of christ
[1:32:23] what was it the tomb the tomb was
[1:32:27] you know the tomb was sealed but
[1:32:29] revelation and
[1:32:31] and we know that but the book of
[1:32:33] revelation shows that
[1:32:36] the book was sealed so at the close of
[1:32:39] the old testament you have a tomb that
[1:32:41] was sealed
[1:32:43] and this at the close of the end time we
[1:32:45] have a book that is sealed
[1:32:48] and without his opening all is lost
[1:32:52] unless it's given back to man it is all
[1:32:56] for nothing
[1:32:58] it represents the title
[1:33:02] amen it is the possession of every
[1:33:05] divine
[1:33:07] lays promise that title it is the
[1:33:09] description of the lamb
[1:33:11] it is the title deed of redemption
[1:33:15] amen and unless
[1:33:19] the book is open calgary is for nothing
[1:33:24] oh man you say brother tim how could
[1:33:27] that be well let me stop here for a
[1:33:28] minute
[1:33:30] without the resurrection calvary was for
[1:33:34] nothing
[1:33:38] without the ascension the resurrection
[1:33:42] was for nothing
[1:33:44] and without the coming of the holy ghost
[1:33:46] all of it was for nothing
[1:33:52] are you with me amen one was making way
[1:33:56] for another they were it was
[1:33:58] it was seasons it was time this was here
[1:34:01] this was the part this is what god was
[1:34:03] doing but it moves on
[1:34:05] [Applause]
[1:34:09] now just as if jesus
[1:34:14] just resurrected and appeared to his
[1:34:16] disciples raised the dead of the ages
[1:34:18] but didn't send a resurrection
[1:34:20] in a change for those waiting at
[1:34:22] pentecost it would have been for nothing
[1:34:26] for those 120 and even for us today
[1:34:29] and let me just go come on bring it fast
[1:34:32] forward now
[1:34:33] to here in this pentecost
[1:34:37] i told you this is another pentecost
[1:34:39] right
[1:34:41] unless the seventh seal was open
[1:34:44] break the silence on his coming
[1:34:51] amen there must be an actual time that
[1:34:56] it happens
[1:35:01] let me just say it this way if there's
[1:35:04] no
[1:35:05] rapture in this age everything
[1:35:08] god has done since pentecost
[1:35:12] has been for nothing
[1:35:18] come on somebody amen god sent in a
[1:35:21] prophet
[1:35:22] god sent it let me go back to jesus
[1:35:25] god sent in the gifts of the spirit god
[1:35:27] returning
[1:35:28] and pouring out a portion of his spirit
[1:35:31] again all of these portions poured out
[1:35:33] would be for nothing
[1:35:36] unless there's a rapture takes place
[1:35:41] everything hinges on a rapture
[1:35:46] and i want you to know we're a part of
[1:35:48] that great rapture today
[1:35:51] and everything is hinging on you walking
[1:35:53] into that rapture
[1:35:56] amen the bible tells you revelation 8 1
[1:35:59] when he opened the seventh seal there
[1:36:00] was silence
[1:36:01] in heaven about the space for a half
[1:36:03] hour and he said i saw the seven angels
[1:36:06] which stood before god
[1:36:07] and they were given seven trumpets and
[1:36:10] another angel come and stood at the
[1:36:12] altar
[1:36:13] having a golden censor that was given to
[1:36:15] him with much incense
[1:36:16] that he should offer it with the prayers
[1:36:18] of all the saints from the golden altar
[1:36:21] which was before the throne
[1:36:22] and the smoke of the incense which came
[1:36:25] uh with the prayers of the saints
[1:36:27] ascended up before god
[1:36:29] out of the angel's hand and the angel
[1:36:31] took the censer
[1:36:32] and filled it with the fire the altar
[1:36:34] and cast into the earth
[1:36:36] and there were voices and thunderings
[1:36:38] and lightnings and an earthquake
[1:36:42] and you're wondering why there's an
[1:36:43] upheaval
[1:36:46] and you're wondering what's happening to
[1:36:48] our world
[1:36:50] and you wonder why our country is
[1:36:52] overrun with anarchists
[1:36:55] and you wonder why they have all given
[1:36:57] their mind to the beast
[1:36:59] you wonder why all of this taken place
[1:37:02] it's because
[1:37:03] god has broke the silence on his coming
[1:37:07] and he's wrapping up the end time here
[1:37:10] in this changing of the season
[1:37:14] and he throws in that seventh seal
[1:37:17] he throws that fire upon the earth
[1:37:22] a man and it begins to burn with voices
[1:37:27] amen that would be avoid the voice of
[1:37:29] the seventh angel
[1:37:30] revealing the voice of the seven
[1:37:32] thunders
[1:37:34] amen and there was thunderings that
[1:37:37] become
[1:37:37] known and lightnings and an earthquake
[1:37:40] and things and upheaval begins upon the
[1:37:43] earth
[1:37:46] and it's all in fulfillment to all of
[1:37:49] those
[1:37:49] who have prayed down to the ages for the
[1:37:52] coming of the lord
[1:37:54] and you are here in that season
[1:38:01] get ready for your new clothes
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:07] hallelujah get ready to move
[1:38:11] from the mortal season into an immoral
[1:38:14] season
[1:38:16] and our jay the incense was mixed with
[1:38:19] the prayers on the altar
[1:38:21] and received that before god this was
[1:38:24] this was typing out actually a
[1:38:27] representative of what god would have
[1:38:29] them do
[1:38:30] in the in the old testament which was
[1:38:32] shadows
[1:38:34] and they were pointing to this time and
[1:38:36] of course all these prayers
[1:38:38] those prayers of the end time prayers
[1:38:41] for vengeance
[1:38:42] upon those that had done wickedly to the
[1:38:45] saints of god
[1:38:46] prayers for the lord's return the last
[1:38:49] prayer of the bible
[1:38:52] you know what it is even so come
[1:38:56] lord jesus but it had to be put on hold
[1:39:02] because you were coming
[1:39:06] your name was in this map too
[1:39:09] come on hallelujah god knew you were
[1:39:12] coming
[1:39:13] and he said i can't come yet so i'll
[1:39:17] just
[1:39:17] come and i'll be interceding until the
[1:39:20] last
[1:39:21] name that is on the book is
[1:39:24] manifested displayed on the earth
[1:39:28] some of you we've been waiting a long
[1:39:31] time for you to get here
[1:39:33] amen but every time another son is born
[1:39:36] god says okay that's it there's another
[1:39:38] name now and then he says there's
[1:39:40] another name
[1:39:41] and i'm interceding for this one and for
[1:39:44] that one
[1:39:47] he's even interceding for your lost
[1:39:49] children
[1:39:50] for the prodigal that needs to come back
[1:39:53] home he is still interceding on the
[1:39:55] behalf
[1:39:57] of the redeemed those names that are in
[1:39:59] the book of redemption
[1:40:01] who must be dipped in blood
[1:40:10] and in our day incense was mixed with
[1:40:12] the prayers on the altar
[1:40:15] and they have been received up before
[1:40:18] god
[1:40:19] and god said okay to do this end time
[1:40:23] i'm going to send him a prophet
[1:40:25] now i've had him i've had him in the
[1:40:28] days of the voice
[1:40:29] or in the days of preparation but now
[1:40:33] will come the days of the voice
[1:40:36] we've not been preparing him with divine
[1:40:38] healing campaigns
[1:40:40] and miracles and signs and identifying i
[1:40:43] was with him and
[1:40:44] this the ministry of christ being
[1:40:46] displayed
[1:40:47] but now now there will be
[1:40:51] the lamb in heaven taking the book and
[1:40:54] loosen the seals
[1:40:55] and on earth i've got a messenger ready
[1:40:59] to receive it as he hands it down to the
[1:41:01] seventh angel on earth
[1:41:03] for the revealing of it
[1:41:06] because when it's mixed with the
[1:41:08] incident it's got to be
[1:41:10] brought down to the earth and it causes
[1:41:13] upheavals
[1:41:16] earthquakes took place some of you who
[1:41:19] were
[1:41:19] in tombs of religion
[1:41:22] amen it broke the seal of the tomb
[1:41:26] oh man and you came out some of you were
[1:41:28] in a baptist room some of you were in a
[1:41:31] methodist too
[1:41:32] some of you were in a pentecostal too
[1:41:34] but i tell you
[1:41:35] when the word came when the hour
[1:41:38] came for it to be fulfilled for there to
[1:41:41] be a resurrection
[1:41:43] denomilation hell could not hold you
[1:41:46] stretchers could not hold you formalism
[1:41:49] could not hold you
[1:41:50] the powers of satan could not hold you
[1:41:59] just says in the days of zechariah the
[1:42:02] father of john the baptist
[1:42:05] you know he went when he
[1:42:08] rose there now this tradition had been
[1:42:11] done
[1:42:12] for many years and typed out but one day
[1:42:15] it wasn't a tradition anymore
[1:42:18] one day he stepped right into the
[1:42:21] prophecy
[1:42:22] and he cares with him the prayers for
[1:42:25] the coming of the lord
[1:42:28] somebody with me cares but they had been
[1:42:31] praying for this messiah
[1:42:33] they had been calling on him to come
[1:42:41] they had been waiting for this hour
[1:42:44] but now all of a sudden
[1:42:48] everything looked just routine
[1:42:51] this is my time well you know i'm
[1:42:54] waiting on a child ah
[1:42:56] it's past it's been he's been

[1:43:07] it'll never come john had sunk down in
[1:43:10] the unbelief the church
[1:43:12] said we're surrounded by romans we can
[1:43:15] never have this messiah
[1:43:17] he'll never come we'll never have we'll
[1:43:19] never have him
[1:43:22] you had a pregnant woman the wife of
[1:43:24] john
[1:43:26] of zechariah the mother of john or to be
[1:43:29] the mother
[1:43:30] and you have a pregnant woman israel
[1:43:34] and they're both waiting and john walks
[1:43:37] in
[1:43:40] and when he does the silence
[1:43:43] is broken
[1:43:50] and when the silence becomes broken the
[1:43:53] angel speaks
[1:43:56] and says i'm gonna you're gonna have a
[1:43:58] son
[1:43:59] and he's gonna be the forerunner
[1:44:03] and this will be the start of the coming
[1:44:06] of the lord
[1:44:08] because there's got to be a forerunner
[1:44:10] come before the messiah can come
[1:44:15] and zechariah said i've been too long
[1:44:18] and i believe
[1:44:18] i can't believe it and god said okay
[1:44:22] shut your mouth i'm not going to let you
[1:44:26] speak
[1:44:26] such nonsense anymore shut up
[1:44:29] until it's fulfilled
[1:44:32] and then i'll open your mouth
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:37] somebody's going to say to some of you
[1:44:39] that are sitting around
[1:44:41] and saying oh how can it be oh there'll
[1:44:44] never be nothing
[1:44:45] oh we're beyond those days it's all past
[1:44:47] i'm just saying
[1:44:48] shut up the angel in this pulpit says
[1:44:53] shut your mouth
[1:44:55] until god fulfills his word but he's
[1:44:58] going to bring forth a bride
[1:45:00] without spot without wrinkle who will
[1:45:03] finish the race
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:45:10] john when the angel appears
[1:45:14] to zechariah and announces the coming of
[1:45:18] john
[1:45:18] it starts a chain of events is like an
[1:45:22] atomic
[1:45:23] explosion that never stops
[1:45:28] i want you to know what started there
[1:45:31] has never stopped to this day
[1:45:35] come on it's still it's still like an
[1:45:38] atomic
[1:45:39] explosion just continue a chain of
[1:45:42] events
[1:45:44] that comes until it wraps up the end
[1:45:47] time
[1:45:48] are you with me now amen so
[1:45:51] you see the same in our day the church
[1:45:54] has looked for the return of jesus
[1:45:56] christ and for it and it's coming from
[1:45:59] mature church
[1:46:00] without spot or wrinkle and i just want
[1:46:03] you to know
[1:46:04] what has been silenced
[1:46:07] because he said seal up those voices of
[1:46:10] thunders
[1:46:11] and don't write them but because they're
[1:46:14] for an end time people
[1:46:17] i'm going to reveal some things to them
[1:46:20] and tell them where they are in time
[1:46:24] where they can have the faith to
[1:46:26] withstand in the evil day
[1:46:29] are you with me amen and the thing that
[1:46:31] the churches look for
[1:46:33] the return of jesus christ and is coming
[1:46:36] from a true church
[1:46:37] without spot or wrinkle what has been
[1:46:40] silenced and what has been wondered
[1:46:44] about
[1:46:45] here it's begun to happen
[1:46:54] and the breaking of the silence of the
[1:46:56] seventh seal
[1:46:58] somebody with me which reveals us
[1:47:01] voices of the thunders there that held
[1:47:04] the mystery of the symbols
[1:47:07] in the book were that we
[1:47:10] now are not wondering what are the
[1:47:13] symbols
[1:47:16] because it had to be written in the word
[1:47:18] but it was not understood
[1:47:20] that's what a thunder is is when god
[1:47:22] says something but it's not understood
[1:47:24] so we say it was a noise it was a
[1:47:28] thunder
[1:47:28] it was the voice of god but we don't
[1:47:30] know what it said
[1:47:32] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:47:35] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:47:37] sound
[1:47:38] his mystery the mystery of god and he's
[1:47:40] speaking directly
[1:47:42] of the seven thunders and he said the
[1:47:45] mystery of god
[1:47:46] shall be finished
[1:47:51] in our day the season
[1:47:54] changes and the lamb
[1:47:58] there's actually movement in heaven that
[1:48:01] did that not happen in the first coming
[1:48:03] of christ
[1:48:05] heaven moved before something happened
[1:48:07] on earth
[1:48:10] amen there were angels
[1:48:13] visited zachariah
[1:48:18] and then and then mary and then joseph
[1:48:22] and then the shepherds and and heaven's
[1:48:25] opening
[1:48:26] heaven's revealing something heaven's
[1:48:29] letting us know there's something going
[1:48:31] on
[1:48:32] it's revealing us to us the christ
[1:48:36] come on and the same in our day at the
[1:48:39] return of jesus christ
[1:48:42] something starts happening in the
[1:48:43] heavens the lamb steps forth in heaven
[1:48:46] and when he does he initiates a change
[1:48:49] of seasons
[1:48:53] in revelation 5 and verse 5 and what are
[1:48:56] the elders said unto me
[1:48:57] weep not behold the lion of the tribe of
[1:49:00] judah
[1:49:01] the root of david had prevailed to open
[1:49:04] the book
[1:49:06] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[1:49:08] i beheld and lo
[1:49:10] in the midst of the throne and of the
[1:49:12] four beasts and in the midst
[1:49:14] of the elders stood a lamb as it had
[1:49:16] been slain
[1:49:18] having seven horns and seven
[1:49:21] eyes which are the seven spirits of god
[1:49:25] to all the earth
[1:49:26] now we look in the symbols we know
[1:49:28] there's no you know if you've got an
[1:49:30] eighth age you're not part of the lamb
[1:49:33] if you've got an eighth messenger you're
[1:49:35] not part of the lamb
[1:49:39] oh today brother tim we got the eighth
[1:49:41] messenger it's the
[1:49:42] holy ghost you're not part of the lamb
[1:49:47] you say why why would you say that
[1:49:51] because anything other than these seven
[1:49:53] horns and seven
[1:49:54] eyes is not part of the lamb
[1:49:58] oh but we have an apostle today you're
[1:50:00] not part of the lamb
[1:50:03] we got another prophet today you're not
[1:50:06] part of the lamb
[1:50:08] oh you know in jeffersonville we have a
[1:50:11] new prophet you're not part of the lamb
[1:50:14] you have excommunicated and identified
[1:50:16] yourself as
[1:50:18] something else not part of the lamb
[1:50:21] amen because the lamb has seven horns
[1:50:24] and
[1:50:24] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:50:27] of god
[1:50:28] and you say well we got it's the holy
[1:50:30] ghost that's who he was
[1:50:32] seven spirits of god the spirit for
[1:50:35] every age
[1:50:38] the one holy spirit and seven
[1:50:41] manifestations
[1:50:42] poured out an anointing on the earth
[1:50:46] are you with me now now then but there
[1:50:49] stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:50:54] now john in the book of revelation he is
[1:50:57] symbolic of the bride
[1:50:59] you know that the book of revelation is
[1:51:01] a symbolic book
[1:51:05] amen come on there's no there's no
[1:51:07] silver golden throne there like that
[1:51:09] we think of that as humans that's the
[1:51:12] way we picture
[1:51:13] there's no there's no book with that's
[1:51:15] leather bound with goat skins or
[1:51:17] lambskin or whatever skin
[1:51:19] the book is symbolic of the believers
[1:51:25] the book of revelation is symbolic john
[1:51:27] is even
[1:51:28] symbolically representing the redeemed
[1:51:32] he's one of the 12 elders of the new
[1:51:34] testaments and there's 12 elders of the
[1:51:36] old testament
[1:51:37] because it is in campus and encompassing
[1:51:40] the redeemed
[1:51:43] now so that's true the lamb that's had
[1:51:45] been slain and
[1:51:47] and of course there is no lamb
[1:51:50] like that in heaven with seven horns and
[1:51:54] seven eyes
[1:51:56] there is a man christ jesus
[1:51:59] who that was symbolic god
[1:52:02] are you with me and john in the book of
[1:52:04] revelation is symbolic of the bride
[1:52:08] and in the exhilaration of the moment
[1:52:10] john
[1:52:11] looks to see a lion
[1:52:14] amen he's looking for a mighty king
[1:52:17] stepping forth
[1:52:19] but it was not the millennium yet
[1:52:22] amen but redemption was still unfolding
[1:52:27] are you with me so he doesn't see a a
[1:52:30] lion at
[1:52:30] all he sees a lamb for the lamb
[1:52:34] is symbolic of his work as kinsman
[1:52:38] redeemer the sacrifice
[1:52:42] and the lamb is stepping forth the one
[1:52:44] who gave his life for us
[1:52:46] who shed his blood is stepping forth to
[1:52:49] claim the book
[1:52:51] and to loose its seals
[1:52:54] now he's a bloody lamb it will take
[1:52:57] blood to purge
[1:52:58] the transgressions of heiress that have
[1:53:01] kept the book sealed
[1:53:02] closed i want you i want to submit to
[1:53:05] you
[1:53:05] this book was not sealed closed in the
[1:53:07] days of paul
[1:53:11] it was the errors of the ages that
[1:53:14] sealed the book and closed
[1:53:16] it was the work of the antichrist that
[1:53:19] closed the book
[1:53:21] in the days of paul the book was open
[1:53:24] the mysteries were revealed we're not
[1:53:27] preaching a new message
[1:53:29] we're preaching the same gospel paul
[1:53:31] preached
[1:53:34] are you with me it's not a new message
[1:53:37] it's not an addendum to the book it's
[1:53:40] exactly what paul preached
[1:53:44] amen what did he say when he went beyond
[1:53:46] the curtain of time so whatever paul
[1:53:47] preached i preached it
[1:53:50] and heaven said we're resting on that
[1:53:54] amen you say well brother tim you see
[1:53:56] that was in 58 or 9 when
[1:53:59] you know 1960 when before the seals was
[1:54:02] open he had that experience and
[1:54:04] and he could say then i just preached
[1:54:06] what paul preached
[1:54:09] no that's when he moved from diamond to
[1:54:12] eternity
[1:54:14] and was being embraced by all the
[1:54:16] mothers over there
[1:54:17] and they said you preached what paul
[1:54:20] preached and said we're resting on that
[1:54:24] our resurrection rest
[1:54:28] um oh the gospel returning to what paul
[1:54:32] preached i'm submitting to you today
[1:54:35] we're not preaching a new message
[1:54:38] we don't have to be like the jehovah's
[1:54:39] witness and and reinterpret the bible
[1:54:42] we don't have to be like the mormons and
[1:54:44] that's the books
[1:54:47] amen brother branham what he said is not
[1:54:49] an addendum to the book
[1:54:53] a man it's not an addition to the bible
[1:54:56] it's the same gospel paul preached
[1:54:59] it's the same word and if so it was the
[1:55:02] same word because it did
[1:55:04] the same miracles in the same sign and
[1:55:06] the same oneness
[1:55:09] [Music]
[1:55:12] john sees the lamb not a lion
[1:55:16] not a mighty king to take the throne of
[1:55:19] david
[1:55:21] that season is close
[1:55:25] but not yet we'll have the millennium
[1:55:29] it's coming it's at least three and a
[1:55:32] half years away
[1:55:35] somebody help me preach a man
[1:55:38] at the very least is three and a half
[1:55:40] years away
[1:55:42] because there's there is the marriage
[1:55:44] supper of the lamb that takes place in
[1:55:46] heaven
[1:55:47] and tribulation on earth

[1:58:23] [Applause]
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:27] [Applause]
[1:58:32] hallelujah
[1:58:35] the lamb in revelation 5 is a bloody
[1:58:38] lamb
[1:58:39] in the season chains we can see him
[1:58:43] it will take purge or blood rather to
[1:58:46] purge
[1:58:47] the transgressions of eras
[1:58:50] that have kept the book sealed and
[1:58:53] closed
[1:58:55] john sees the lamb he does not
[1:58:58] see a lion and if you're the true
[1:59:02] bride hear me now all around the world
[1:59:06] hear me
[1:59:07] if you see if you if you're the true
[1:59:09] bride you do not see
[1:59:11] a lion who is judged
[1:59:15] and angry and judgmental
[1:59:20] so that you can be haughty
[1:59:24] disrespectful and
[1:59:27] ugly in your judgmental ways
[1:59:33] no but when you see him if you're too
[1:59:35] bright you'll see a lamb
[1:59:39] amen amen amen not a mighty king to take
[1:59:43] the throne again
[1:59:44] of david that season is close
[1:59:49] but there must come forth first the
[1:59:52] season
[1:59:53] of the anointed messiahs
[1:59:57] amen and be and and then be the anointed
[2:00:00] one the book
[2:00:01] of title must be released
[2:00:05] back not to sons of adam but to the sons
[2:00:08] of jesus
[2:00:13] the second adam
[2:00:17] now by the opening of the seals
[2:00:20] she's been turned from all the
[2:00:22] traditions of man
[2:00:23] back to the true and original atonement
[2:00:28] by the opening of the books you can see
[2:00:30] that there's still blood
[2:00:32] and that that blood has never lost its
[2:00:35] power
[2:00:37] once upon once again there's a people on
[2:00:39] earth that can embrace and harness
[2:00:42] the power of the original atonement
[2:00:46] sickness is conquered come on somebody
[2:00:50] amen diseases are destroyed
[2:00:53] sin is vanquished and death is abolished
[2:00:57] remember because he's just as much lamb
[2:00:59] today
[2:01:00] as he ever was a matter this is what the
[2:01:04] opening of the book revealed
[2:01:06] not a bunch of head knowledge that but
[2:01:08] granting to us the contents
[2:01:10] of the book that he's the same yesterday
[2:01:14] today
[2:01:14] and forever
[2:01:18] why it had to be shepherd my friend
[2:01:21] brother caleb who's
[2:01:22] listened to me shared this with me this
[2:01:24] quotation listen
[2:01:26] and he said jesus christ is saying
[2:01:28] yesterday today and forever
[2:01:30] it is that same lamb he's just as much
[2:01:33] lamb today as he was then
[2:01:37] he's just as much here as he was there
[2:01:42] hallelujah for his word is the same let
[2:01:45] me just read it again
[2:01:46] it's the same yesterday today and
[2:01:49] forever
[2:01:50] he's just as much the lamb today
[2:01:53] as he was then he's just as much
[2:01:56] here as he was there for his word is the
[2:02:01] same
[2:02:01] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[2:02:04] name
[2:02:04] there i am in the midst that's exactly
[2:02:08] what he said he never changes he still
[2:02:10] he's god the word and never changes
[2:02:15] now the lamb in revelation
[2:02:18] 5 is dismissing the claims
[2:02:22] against the book that was closed to us
[2:02:30] i want you to get that the lamb in
[2:02:33] revelation
[2:02:34] 5 is dismissing
[2:02:38] the claims against the book
[2:02:43] that kept it closed to us
[2:02:47] stop and realize where we're in time
[2:02:50] we're another season for thousands of
[2:02:54] years
[2:02:55] this book has remained in the hands of
[2:02:57] god but in this day
[2:02:59] there's been a change
[2:03:02] as a man has been found worthy to take
[2:03:05] the book out of
[2:03:06] the hand of him that sat on the throne
[2:03:08] and that was not william branham that
[2:03:09] was jesus christ
[2:03:11] notice he was taken back it has to be an
[2:03:14] abstract
[2:03:16] title deed in other words it has to be a
[2:03:19] clear deed there can be nobody
[2:03:23] from former ages where that they made a
[2:03:27] debt that is against the piece of
[2:03:29] property
[2:03:30] it must every debt must be annulled
[2:03:35] well that's what happened to you when
[2:03:37] you were born again you got an abstract
[2:03:42] that every listen that jesus paid
[2:03:45] every debt of sin that was against you
[2:03:50] and that you are free to serve the
[2:03:52] living god
[2:03:54] and god gave you an abstract no matter
[2:03:56] if your mother did it if your daddy did
[2:03:58] it
[2:03:58] no matter if you were born wrong

[2:04:19] and we owed a debt we could not pay
[2:04:27] and now the holy ghost is your proof
[2:04:31] that the devil has no claim on you

[2:04:42] it's your proof that the devil has no
[2:04:45] claim on you
[2:04:46] so when the devil said this and the
[2:04:49] devil said that yeah but when i got an
[2:04:50] abstract
[2:04:53] every claim he had on my life if i
[2:04:56] smoked he had a claim
[2:04:57] if i drank he had a claim if i if i
[2:04:59] committed adultery he had a claim
[2:05:01] if i well if i used cocaine or drugs he
[2:05:04] had a claim
[2:05:06] and whatever it was he had a claim but
[2:05:09] the day jesus paid my debt
[2:05:11] [Music]
[2:05:13] he gave me an abstract and i have a
[2:05:16] clean title
[2:05:18] a perfect title i have a right to come
[2:05:21] before the throne of grace
[2:05:23] not as a sinner but as a child of the
[2:05:26] most high god
[2:05:28] i am redeemed
[2:05:32] and that through the churches in this
[2:05:35] hour she has redeemed
[2:05:37] every claim that the devil had against
[2:05:40] us
[2:05:41] that kept us from the possession of the
[2:05:44] book
[2:05:45] has been removed and the book is
[2:05:48] unsealed
[2:05:49] by the lamb because only his blood
[2:05:52] could redeem and remit
[2:05:56] the claims against us
[2:06:01] he had a claim satan had a claim on
[2:06:03] luther
[2:06:04] and that church
[2:06:07] satan had a claim on wesley and that
[2:06:10] church
[2:06:14] amen satan had a claim on azusa street
[2:06:18] and that church but i got some news for
[2:06:22] the devil
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:24] the lamb has taken the book and loosed
[2:06:27] the seals
[2:06:29] and jesus took the blood his own blood
[2:06:32] and he
[2:06:33] wiped the claims against us off
[2:06:36] what luther did what wesley did what
[2:06:38] what as zoos as we did the mistakes
[2:06:40] that's been made
[2:06:41] along the journey and you have a perfect
[2:06:44] title
[2:06:45] and a clear claim to a rapture
[2:06:49] the devil cannot say you can you can be
[2:06:52] held back
[2:06:52] another age another time he can't say it
[2:06:56] the book has been cleared of its seals
[2:07:00] and it's now opened and that makes every
[2:07:03] one of you
[2:07:04] a messiah a possessor of the title deed
[2:07:09] that it all belongs to you as the
[2:07:11] children of god
[2:07:15] it's another season it's another season
[2:07:19] for thousands of years
[2:07:21] it remained in the hands of god
[2:07:25] but in this day there's been a change
[2:07:29] as a man who was worthy
[2:07:32] to take the book out of the hand of him
[2:07:35] sat on the throne
[2:07:36] that sat on the throne and he was to
[2:07:39] take it back
[2:07:40] it was to be an abstract title deed
[2:07:47] this book had been waiting for
[2:07:49] redemption claims
[2:07:54] abstract brother branham would say
[2:07:57] abstract what does that mean he said it
[2:07:59] means
[2:08:00] there's been a title search
[2:08:07] it means there's been a title search
[2:08:15] as property is handed down from one
[2:08:18] person to another there could be people
[2:08:22] and you could buy a nice piece of
[2:08:24] property
[2:08:25] and go go to possess it and all of a
[2:08:28] sudden find out
[2:08:30] that some man before him before you or
[2:08:33] two generations before
[2:08:36] had put a lien on this because
[2:08:40] he didn't pay a bill and he owed money
[2:08:45] and so there's a debt that that
[2:08:48] must be cleared before the title can be
[2:08:51] transferred
[2:08:55] and the book was held in the hands of
[2:08:57] almighty god
[2:08:59] somebody with me amen and it could not
[2:09:03] be transferred
[2:09:04] back to man because adam had sinned
[2:09:08] and sold us come on
[2:09:11] and then down to the ages here we have
[2:09:14] all of these things
[2:09:15] that's why every person has to have that
[2:09:18] abstract title deed
[2:09:20] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:09:22] that that clears your debt
[2:09:25] personally i mean some of you are mixed
[2:09:29] up in your marriage
[2:09:31] some of you were engaged before
