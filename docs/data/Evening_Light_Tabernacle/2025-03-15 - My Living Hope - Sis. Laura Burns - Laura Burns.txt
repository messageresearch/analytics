[Music] how great the chasm that lay between us how high the mountain I could not climb in desperation I turned to heaven and spoke your name into the night then through the darkness your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul the work is finished and the end it's written Jesus Christ my Living Hope who could imagine so great Mercy what heart could faom such bound less Grace the god of Ages step down from glory to wear my sin and bear my shame the cross has spoken I am forgiv the king of kings calls me his beautiful savior I'm yours forever Jesus Christ my Living Hope Oh hallelujah praise the one who sent me free Hallelujah death has l lost its grip on me you have broken Every Chain there's salvation in your name Jesus Christ my Living Hope then came the morning that seal the promise your bued body began to breathe and out of the silence the roaring lion declare the grave has no claim on me then came the morning that seal our promise your very body began to breathing out of the silence I roaring my end declare the grave and has no claim on me oh Hallelujah raise the one who set me free Hallelujah death has lost its G on me you have broken Every Chain there's salvation in your name Jesus Christ my Living Hope Oh hallelujah praise the one who set us free Hallelujah death has lost its grip on on me you have broken Every Chain there's salvation in your name Jesus Christ my Living Hope oh Jesus Christ you're my living home [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
