[34:26] Say, here I am. Here [singing] I am to
[34:31] worship. [music]
[34:32] Here I am to bow.
[34:36] Oh, [singing] here I am to say [music]
[34:40] that you're my God in [singing]
[34:44] your all together love.
[34:48] Oh, all together.
[34:51] [music]
[34:53] All together [singing] wonderful
[34:58] to [music] me.
[35:03] You are [singing] beautiful
[35:05] beyond
[35:07] description,
[35:10] Lord. You're tongless
[35:12] [singing and music]
[35:15] for work,
[35:20] [music] too wonderful [singing] for
[35:23] comprehension,
[35:26] [music]
[35:28] like nothing [singing]
[35:30] ever seen or heard.
[35:36] And who can [singing] grasp
[35:39] your infinite [music]
[35:41] wisdom?
[35:43] [singing]
[35:44] And who can fathom [music]
[35:47] the depths [singing] of your love?
[35:52] [music]
[35:52] And you are beautiful
[35:56] beyond
[35:58] description.
[36:01] Oh [singing] majesty [music]
[36:04] enthroned
[36:06] above
[36:08] [singing]
[36:09] [music] and I stand
[36:12] I stand
[36:14] in [singing] all of you. [music]
[36:18] Oh, I stand
[36:21] I stand
[36:23] in all [singing] of you [music]
[36:26] and holy God
[36:29] [music] to [singing]
[36:32] all praisees
[36:34] to I stand [singing]
[36:38] in all [music]
[36:40] of you for I stand [singing]
[36:43] say I stand [music]
[36:46] I stand [singing]
[36:48] in all of you.
[36:52] Oh, [singing] I stand.
[36:54] I stand [music]
[36:57] in all of you,
[37:00] holy God.
[37:03] [music]
[37:04] Who through who all praise is [singing]
[37:07] you.
[37:09] I [music] stand in awe
[37:13] of you [singing]
[37:16] and [music] you are beautiful [singing]
[37:20] beyond
[37:22] description.
[37:25] Yeah. God [singing] crushed you for
[37:28] [music]
[37:29] my sin.
[37:33] And [music and singing]
[37:34] in agony
[37:36] and deep
[37:38] affliction
[37:42] you were [singing] cut off that I
[37:45] [music] might enter in.
[37:50] Who can grasp
[37:52] such tender [music and singing]
[37:54] compassion?
[37:58] And who can fathom [music and singing]
[38:01] a mercy so free? [music and singing]
[38:06] And you are beautiful
[38:09] beyond [singing and music]
[38:11] description.
[38:14] Oh lamb of [singing and music] God.
[38:17] Yes. Who died
[38:19] for me? [music]
[38:22] And I stand.
[38:26] I [music] stand [singing]
[38:28] in all of you.
[38:31] Oh, [singing] I stand. [music]
[38:34] I stand
[38:36] in all of you.
[38:39] Holy [singing]
[38:40] God
[38:42] to whom
[38:44] all praise [music and singing] is due.
[38:48] I stand [music]
[38:52] in all [singing]
[38:53] you
[38:56] and I believe [singing]
[38:59] you are who you say you are [music]
[39:04] and you [singing] do what you say you'll
[39:08] do.
[39:10] [music] You'll come [singing] through.
[39:12] You are always
[39:15] [music]
[39:16] faithful.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[39:18] &gt;&gt; I believe
[39:20] that you [music] already made [singing]
[39:23] a way.
[39:25] So I'm running through parted ways
[39:29] [music and singing]
[39:30] straight to you.
[39:33] You are Oh. Can we all stand and sing it
[39:35] now? Say, [music and singing] "I
[39:36] believe.
[39:38] I believe
[39:41] you [singing] are who you [music] say
[39:43] you are.
[39:46] And you do what you say you'll do.
[39:51] You'll come through.
[39:53] You [music and singing] are always
[39:56] there.
[39:58] I believe [music]
[40:01] that you've [singing] already made a
[40:04] way.
[40:06] I'm running through parted ways
[40:09] [music and singing]
[40:11] straight to you.
[40:13] You are Oh, can we sing it one more
[40:16] time? [singing] Tell them tonight.
[40:16] [music]
[40:17] Say, I believe. I believe
[40:21] that you [singing] are who [music] you
[40:23] say you are.
[40:26] If you'll do [singing] what you say
[40:29] you'll [music] do,
[40:31] you'll come [singing] through.
[40:34] You are [music] always
[40:37] faithful.
[40:39] I believe
[40:42] you've [singing] already made [music] a
[40:44] way.
[40:46] So [singing] I'm running through parted
[40:50] ways
[40:51] [music] straight to you.
[40:54] You are always [music]
[40:57] [singing] faithful.
[41:01] Amen.
[41:03] And do [music] you believe tonight?
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without faith, it's impossible to
[41:09] please [music] God. Amen. So tonight,
[41:13] we're to believe. We're called [music]
[41:15] to believe. Amen. No matter what
[41:17] circumstances you face, no matter what
[41:19] situations [music] face you tonight,
[41:22] we're believers. Amen. Let's just pray
[41:24] together. Father Lord, we come before
[41:27] [music] you tonight on this Wednesday
[41:28] night, Lord. Just asking you to come and
[41:30] move and speak, Lord. [music]
[41:32] Lord, speak to every need and every
[41:34] heart. I just pray, Lord, as we go
[41:36] through your word and Lord, take a
[41:38] journey through these scriptures, Lord,
[41:39] that something [music] would would stand
[41:41] out and and speak and Lord, reach
[41:44] somebody's heart tonight in the
[41:45] situation that they may be in. [music]
[41:46] Lord, I just pray we'd be encouraged
[41:48] tonight to press the battle, to take
[41:50] another step, [music] Lord. Lord, to go
[41:52] further with you tonight, Father, as
[41:54] you've called us, Lord. You've called us
[41:56] on a faith journey, Lord. And we're not
[41:58] stopping along the way, Lord, but we're
[42:00] going all the way, Lord, to fulfillment.
[42:02] [music]
[42:03] Lord, I just pray you'll just move me
[42:04] out of the way now, Lord. That you'll
[42:06] speak, Lord, [music] words of life,
[42:08] Lord, and that you'll bless your word as
[42:09] we read it throughout this evening. In
[42:11] Jesus name we [music] pray. Amen. Amen.
[42:15] God bless you tonight. It's good to be
[42:17] in the house of God, isn't it? Amen. If
[42:20] you have your Bibles and you'd [music]
[42:22] turn with me tonight to Genesis 12 and
[42:24] verse one,
[42:26] we're going to speak to you tonight on
[42:29] the thought the reward of Melzdc.
[42:33] The reward
[42:35] of Melzdc
[42:39] tells us here in Genesis 12:1
[42:42] says, "Now the Lord had said unto Abram,
[42:45] get thee out of thy country, and from
[42:47] thy kindred, and from thy father's house
[42:49] unto a land that I will show thee, and I
[42:52] will make of thee a great nation, and I
[42:53] will bless thee, and make thy name
[42:55] great, and thou shalt be a blessing. And
[42:58] I will bless them that bless thee, and
[43:00] curse them that curse thee. And in thee
[43:02] shall all families of the earth be
[43:05] blessed. And I like I'm just going to
[43:07] read the beginning of verse four. So
[43:10] Abram departed. Amen. I pray that the
[43:13] Lord will add his blessings as we have
[43:15] our seats.
[43:18] What we see here is is is the call of
[43:21] Abraham and and the promise given to
[43:23] Abraham. And and immediately we see how
[43:26] Abraham responds and and I feel like
[43:28] that so much can be learned from these
[43:31] three words. So Abram departed. Amen.
[43:36] Because because instantly we see him
[43:38] begin to operate in faith. There's not a
[43:40] whole lot of questions of well well how
[43:42] are you going to take care of me on this
[43:44] journey and what's going to happen along
[43:45] the way? But it just says Abram
[43:48] departed. Amen. and and he he obeys the
[43:51] command of God without question and
[43:53] without knowing where it is exactly he's
[43:55] going. You know, the Lord just said,
[43:56] "You're going to a place that I'll show
[43:58] you." And he and he begins this journey
[44:00] and he leaves his father and he leaves
[44:02] security. He leaves familiarity. And and
[44:06] I think we can learn from this because
[44:07] whenever God speaks to us and when we
[44:10] know that it's God speaking to us, it
[44:12] behooves us to do what it is God's
[44:14] saying. Amen. We don't have to get him
[44:16] to explain everything to us just
[44:18] perfectly. If God says move, we should
[44:20] move. If if God says go, we we should
[44:23] go. Amen. Whether it makes sense to us
[44:25] or not. It doesn't really matter if it
[44:27] if it makes sense to us or whether we
[44:29] can see the benefit of this move. Th
[44:31] those things don't matter. I'm I'm sure
[44:33] in the moment it didn't really make
[44:35] sense to Abraham and and I'm sure it
[44:37] really didn't make sense to Sarah when
[44:39] he went in there and just said, "Pack up
[44:40] your house. You know, we're moving." And
[44:42] she's like, "Oh, do we get a a bigger
[44:44] house and a nicer neighborhood?" And
[44:45] he's like, "No, we're we're just going."
[44:48] Well, where are we going? We're just
[44:50] going.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Just pack up your things. I'm sure these
[44:53] things didn't make sense to them. Amen.
[44:55] I mean, this was the first time that God
[44:57] had spoken to Abraham. He hasn't
[45:00] unfolded himself to him yet. He He
[45:02] hasn't revealed much about his nature
[45:04] and he doesn't give him a specific plan.
[45:06] He just gives him a a command and he
[45:09] gives him a promise. Amen. And and I
[45:12] believe tonight that we've been given
[45:13] we've been given commands and we've been
[45:15] given promises. But we're we're blessed
[45:17] to live in a time where God has
[45:19] completely unfolded himself to us and
[45:21] and we see the plan of God and and we
[45:23] know how God's working. We can see how
[45:25] God's work. There's so much available to
[45:28] us that our faith should be at a place
[45:30] that when God speaks, we don't have to
[45:31] question. When God speaks, we know that
[45:34] he has our our our um our best interest
[45:37] at heart. He's going to work all things
[45:38] out according to our good. And we just
[45:40] need to be willing to follow his
[45:43] leadership. Amen. And and God gives
[45:45] Abraham a command. And he gives him a
[45:47] promise. And he says, "Get thee out, and
[45:50] I will make of thee a great nation, and
[45:52] I will bless thee." And and Abraham
[45:54] responds by leaving. And he starts this
[45:57] journey. And it's in a journey that
[45:59] that'll entail hardship. It's a journey
[46:01] that's going to entail many trials and
[46:03] and uncertainty. And and on this
[46:06] journey, there's family disputes. And on
[46:09] this journey, there's famines. And on
[46:10] this journey, there's human mistakes.
[46:13] And there's failures. There's even lies
[46:15] on this journey.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm thankful tonight that the
[46:19] uncertainty and the trials and the lies
[46:21] and even the failures are not what his
[46:23] journey is remembered for.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. But this journey leads to Abraham
[46:28] being known as the father of the faith.
[46:31] It's not a journey of failure, but it's
[46:33] a journey of victory.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's faith in the promise
[46:38] resulting in the in the manifestation of
[46:40] the promise. Listen, I want TO TELL YOU
[46:42] TONIGHT, wherever you're at, no matter
[46:44] how many failures you've had, this isn't
[46:46] a journey of failure. It's it's not a
[46:49] journey about how you got left in Leody
[46:51] and how how you missed the rapture.
[46:53] That's not going to be how this story is
[46:55] told. Amen. It's a journey that results
[46:58] in the manifestation of the promise in
[47:01] your life.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans would SAY THAT THAT ABRAM
[47:05] CALLED those things which were not as
[47:07] though they were. He against hope
[47:10] believed in hope. And it tells us here
[47:12] in in verse 20, it says, "HE STAGGERED
[47:14] NOT AT THE promise of God through
[47:16] unbelief, but was strong in the faith,
[47:19] giving glory to God, and being fully
[47:21] persuaded that what he had promised, he
[47:24] was able also to perform. And therefore,
[47:27] it was imputed unto him
[47:30] &gt;&gt; for righteousness."
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Impute. What? What? What does this word
[47:34] mean? Impute. It means to credit or
[47:38] reckon something to someone's account.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. THINK ABOUT THAT. GOD CREDITED
[47:44] Abraham's faith and his promise as right
[47:47] standing between him and God.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; He credited him with right standing
[47:52] between him and God because of his faith
[47:54] in the promise. And he declared HIM
[47:56] RIGHTEOUS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS PERFECT
[47:59] &gt;&gt; but because of his faith in the promise.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Simply put, Abraham believed God. Amen.
[48:06] Do we have any believers here tonight?
[48:08] People that SAY, "I BELIEVE GOD TONIGHT
[48:10] no matter what." Listen, we look at IT
[48:13] AND WE KNOW Abraham's failures.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; We know his missteps. WE SEE THE FLAWED
[48:18] HUMANITY. BUT WE GET OVER HERE IN the
[48:21] New Testament and that isn't THE STORY
[48:23] THAT'S TOLD AT ALL.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Faith is the story. Strength is the
[48:27] story. Righteous is the verdict. Amen.
[48:30] AND IT'S NOT JUST ABRAHAM, BUT SARAH
[48:32] ALSO. SHE LAUGHED AT THE PROMISE RIGHT
[48:36] IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF GOD. BUT YOU GET
[48:38] OVER IN HEBREWS 11 AND IT SAYS THAT
[48:41] THROUGH FAITH ALSO SARAH receives
[48:43] strength because she judged him
[48:47] faithful.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; And that, you know, and that's great for
[48:50] Abraham and that's great for Sarah.
[48:52] That's great for FOR THE DIFFERENT BIBLE
[48:54] CHARACTERS DOWN THROUGH THE THROUGH THE
[48:56] AGES. But I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU, DON'T
[48:58] STOP READING RIGHT THERE ON VERSE 22.
[49:02] DON'T STOP THERE, BUT READ ON WHERE IT
[49:04] SAYS, "NOW IT WAS NOT WRITTEN FOR HIS
[49:06] SAKE ALONE THAT IT WAS IMPUTED TO HIM,
[49:09] BUT FOR US ALSO TO WHOM IT SHALL BE
[49:12] IMPUTED, IF WE BELIEVE ON him that
[49:15] raised up the Lord Jesus from THE DEAD."
[49:18] &gt;&gt; CHURCH, YOU'VE DONE THINGS WRONG. I DID
[49:21] THINGS WRONG. You've sinned. You failed.
[49:23] YOU'VE COME UP SHORT. AND SATAN JUMPS UP
[49:26] AND DOWN AND POINTS AND HOLLERS AT EVERY
[49:28] LITTLE MISTAKE YOU MAKE. OH, LOOK WHAT
[49:30] HE'S DONE NOW. LOOK AT THE THOUGHT
[49:32] THEY'RE HAVING NOW. LOOK AT HOW HE ACTED
[49:34] TODAY. Every little stumble and every
[49:37] misstep and every past sin, HE'S THE
[49:40] ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; It says he's the accuser of the brethren
[49:45] both day and night.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, IT NEVER STOPS.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; WHY THE CONSTANT mind battles, brother
[49:51] Aaron? Why the torment in my mind?
[49:53] Because the he's the accuser of the
[49:55] brethren. HE DOESN'T TAKE A BREAK, BUT
[49:58] HE ACCUSES YOU CONSTANTLY. HE STANDS
[50:00] THERE AND accuses and accuses and
[50:03] accuses. BUT ONCE THOSE SINS HAVE BEEN
[50:06] DROPPED IN THE BLEACH OF THE BLOOD, ONCE
[50:09] THEY'VE BEEN PUT UNDER THE BLOOD, THE
[50:11] DEVIL CAN HOWL ALL HE WANTS TO. HE CAN
[50:13] SHOUT ALL HE WANTS TO. HE CAN ACCUSE YOU
[50:16] ALL HE WANT TO. BUT GOD DOES NOT SEE IT
[50:18] TONIGHT.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD DOESN'T SEE YOUR
[50:21] FAILURES. HE DOESN'T SEE YOUR FLAWS. HE
[50:24] DOESN'T REMEMBER IT. WHAT ARE YOU
[50:26] SAYING? YOU'RE FORGIVEN TONIGHT.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE FORGIVEN TONIGHT. AND WHEN THE
[50:31] STORY OF YOUR LIFE IS RECOUNTED, IT
[50:33] WON'T BE FULL OF ACCUSATIONS.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT WON'T BE FULL OF TALKING
[50:38] ABOUT YOUR SINS AND TELLING ABOUT YOUR
[50:40] RUNNING. AND IT WON'T MENTION YOUR
[50:42] BACKSLIDING. IT WON'T MENTION THE
[50:44] STRUGGLES THAT YOU HAD TODAY. BUT IT'LL
[50:47] SAY THEY OVERCAME HIM IN LEODOSA BY THE
[50:50] BLOOD OF THE LAMB AND BY THE WORD OF THE
[50:52] TESTIMONY. THEY WERE STRONG IN THE
[50:54] FAITH. GIVING GLORY TO GOD.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; IT'LL SAY, "HE CONQUERED SATAN'S EDEN."
[50:59] IT'LL SAY, "SHE STOOD IN THE DARKEST OF
[51:01] TIME. HE BELIEVED MY MESSAGE. HE
[51:03] RECEIVED MY SALVATION. HE ACCEPTED MY
[51:06] TOKEN." THAT'S HOW YOUR STORY will be
[51:08] told in the ages to come.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; And then we'll stand clothed in his
[51:16] righteousness, holy with his holiness.
[51:20] Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Church, that excites me
[51:23] &gt;&gt; that my story is going to be told
[51:25] through the blood.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Aren't you glad that every
[51:30] thought you had today isn't going to be
[51:31] recounted.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Every word, every thought over the last
[51:34] month, how you acted in certain
[51:36] situations, but it's going to be told
[51:38] through the blood. That you staggered
[51:40] not. That you stood in Leodysia. That
[51:42] you accepted the word for your hour,
[51:44] THAT YOU HAD THE TOKEN IN YOUR LIFE.
[51:46] THAT'S HOW YOUR STORY IS TOLD.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:50] prophet of God says, "And that's the way
[51:51] with a real Christian."
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Did you know a real Christian doesn't
[51:55] even ha even any sin at all imputed to
[52:00] him?
[52:02] &gt;&gt; David said, "Blessed is the man who God
[52:04] will not impute sin to." When you're
[52:06] washed in the blood of the lamb, not by
[52:08] make believe,
[52:10] &gt;&gt; but really the blood of the lamb, God
[52:12] does not impute to you anything that's
[52:14] done.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Notice he didn't say you don't do
[52:18] anything. Come on.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; That's powerful, church.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS HE DOESN'T IMPUTE TO YOU
[52:24] ANYTHING THAT'S DONE
[52:27] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'RE UNDER THE BLOOD AND HE
[52:30] DOESN'T SEE IT.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; OH, BUT I FAILED TODAY. AND THE DEVIL
[52:33] SAID AND THE DEVIL SAID AND THE DEVIL
[52:35] SAID AND HE PROBABLY TELLING YOU EXACTLY
[52:37] WHAT YOU DID, BUT HE DOESN'T IMPUTE IT
[52:39] TO YOU BECAUSE IT'S UNDER THE BLOOD
[52:41] TONIGHT.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING AND YOU'RE FAILING
[52:44] AND YOU'RE FAILING, QUIT WALLERING IN
[52:46] YOUR FAILURES. PUT IT UNDER THE BLOOD
[52:48] AND PRESS ON INTO FORGIVENESS TONIGHT.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; I love that the way the scripture says,
[52:55] "But for us also
[52:59] &gt;&gt; because we too have been called."
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We too, many of us have have have
[53:05] departed from family, have left father
[53:08] and mother and separated from friends.
[53:11] And you're on a journey,
[53:13] &gt;&gt; a faith walk just like Abraham, walking
[53:16] after the promise, and not knowing
[53:18] exactly whether he went si searching for
[53:22] a city whose builder and maker is God.
[53:25] And along the way on this journey, you
[53:27] have so many trials.
[53:29] Days where you're so unsure about
[53:31] things, mistakes,
[53:34] failures, days where the journey seems
[53:37] overwhelming.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Times where YOU WONDER AND TIMES WHEN
[53:44] YOU DOUBT.
[53:47] But if we can look into the journey of
[53:49] Abraham tonight and see those things are
[53:52] normal.
[53:54] THAT'S HUMANITY.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; THAT'S PART OF THE JOURNEY. THAT THAT'S
[53:58] THE BATTLE THAT WE'RE IN. BUT FOR A SEED
[54:00] OF ABRAHAM, IT DOESN'T STOP US.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T DERAIL US. WE WE DON'T CAMP
[54:05] DOWN IN OUR FAILURE AND WE WE DON'T MAKE
[54:08] EXCUSE FOR OUR FAILURE. BUT WE GET UP
[54:10] AND WE JOURNEY ON AND WE JUDGE HIM
[54:13] FAITHFUL TONIGHT. WE GET UP AND WE TAKE
[54:16] ANOTHER STEP AND WE BELIEVE GOD TONIGHT.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE FAILURES, BUT WE DON'T LIVE IN
[54:22] THAT PLACE OF FAILURE.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; WE GET UP, WE REPENT, WE PUT IT UNDER
[54:26] THE BLOOD, AND WE MARCH FORWARD TOWARDS
[54:28] THE PROMISE TONIGHT.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT. I BELIEVE IT.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT, SO IT WILL BE DONE.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; HE PROMISED HE'D NEVER LEAVE ME OR
[54:39] FORSAKE ME.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; THESE ARE PROMISES THAT WE'RE HOLDING ON
[54:42] TO TONIGHT. HE PROMISED THAT THOSE WHO
[54:44] BELIEVE WOULD BE SAVED. HE PROMISED I
[54:47] COULD HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. HE PROMISED
[54:49] THAT I COULD HAVE MY CHILDREN. And I may
[54:51] BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN CHAPTER 12 WHEN THE
[54:54] CALL WAS GIVEN AND CHAPTER 21 when he
[54:57] received THE PROMISED SON. I MAY BE
[54:59] SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. AND A LOT OF STUFF
[55:01] HAPPENED IN THOSE CHAPTERS.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; I MAY BE SOMEWHERE IN CHAPTER 14 OR 15
[55:05] IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE, BUT WHAT I
[55:07] KNOW IS I'M ON THE ROAD TO FULFILLMENT
[55:10] ALL THE TIME.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; We're on the road to fulfillment
[55:17] tonight. Yes,
[55:20] just going to go through a lot of these
[55:21] scriptures tonight and take a journey
[55:23] with Abraham in these scriptures.
[55:26] We know in chapter 13
[55:30] that Abraham separates himself from Lot
[55:33] due to the striving amongst the herdsmen
[55:35] and
[55:37] Lot chooses the well-watered plains of
[55:39] Jordan.
[55:42] says here in chapter 13 and 11,
[55:45] then Lot chose him all the plain of
[55:48] Jordan. And Lot journeyed east, and they
[55:51] separated themselves the one from the
[55:53] other. Abram dwelt in the land of
[55:56] Canaan. Lot dwelt in the cities of the
[55:59] plain and pitched his tent towards
[56:01] Sodom. Now, I'm going to keep reading,
[56:04] but one thing I want you to recognize
[56:05] some of the things we're talking about
[56:08] is that on the journey,
[56:10] you're going to go through painful
[56:12] situations.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; You're going to go through hard
[56:15] separations.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; You're going to go through things you
[56:18] don't understand, but there's always a
[56:20] reason for it
[56:22] &gt;&gt; in God's economy.
[56:24] says, "And the Lord said unto Abram,
[56:27] after that Lot was separated from him,
[56:30] lift up now thine eyes, and look from
[56:33] the place where thou art northward and
[56:35] southward and eastward and westward. For
[56:37] all the land which thou seeest, to thee
[56:40] will I give it, and to thy seed
[56:42] forever."
[56:44] And one thing I I don't think we pay a
[56:46] lot of attention to sometimes is how
[56:48] difficult this was for Abram to do.
[56:52] First of all, he knew he was supposed to
[56:54] do it when he left originally
[56:57] &gt;&gt; and he couldn't do it.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; And we come to this place and it's a
[57:02] very painful separation because Abraham
[57:06] loves Lot.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; This is no small thing. It's a very big
[57:11] deal for Abraham because remember
[57:14] Abraham is childless. Right.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham's brother Heron had passed away
[57:20] and and Lot was like his adopted son.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; He had taken him into his home and had
[57:26] taken the responsibility of caregiver,
[57:29] the responsibility of of watching over
[57:32] and keeping and guiding and giving
[57:34] wisdom and being a father to Lot.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; It was like an adopted son and he felt
[57:39] an obligation to watch out for him,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; to care for him.
[57:44] And in chapter 14, we see he's willing
[57:47] to risk his life and his entire
[57:50] household in ORDER TO SAVE LOT WHEN HE'S
[57:52] BEEN CAPTURED.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; HE'S WILLING TO RISK everything for Lot.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; And you we can see there's such a a deep
[58:01] love and a deep affection and the WAY
[58:03] THAT HE FIGHTS for Lot and and even the
[58:05] way he intercedes WITH GOD OVER SODOM
[58:08] BECAUSE OF LOT.
[58:10] BECAUSE IT'S A LOT THAT'S THERE AND ALL
[58:12] OF IT GOES BEYOND TYPICAL FAMILY DUTY
[58:16] AND IT ILLUSTRATES A PROFOUND AND EVEN
[58:19] FATHERLY love
[58:21] &gt;&gt; and commitment.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; This is the relationship THAT HE HAS
[58:24] WITH LOT AND WE START TO see why
[58:30] WHY DID GOD WANT HIM SEPARATED FROM LOT?
[58:34] WHY DID GOD ALLOW THE STRIFE TO COME
[58:36] BETWEEN THEM that separates them? And
[58:39] first of all, as like we've already
[58:41] said, WE KNOW IT'S BECAUSE he was
[58:42] supposed to leave all of his kindred as
[58:45] God told him in Genesis 12:1. And and
[58:47] this conflict here in chapter 13
[58:50] essentially puts Abraham in a position
[58:52] to come into complete obedience to that
[58:55] command.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; But it's even deeper than that because
[58:59] what we SEE IS A FATHERLY love and
[59:02] affection from Abraham towards Lot. And
[59:06] we begin to see Lot as a potential heir.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; We see Lot as a potential heir, as
[59:13] Abram's closest kin and with the way
[59:16] that he feels towards Lot. And as long
[59:19] as Lot is there, Abram's desperation for
[59:22] a son is satiated.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS LOT IS THERE, HIS DESPERATION
[59:28] FOR FULFILLMENT IS SATIATED BECAUSE HE
[59:31] FATHERS LOT AND HE LOVES LOT. IN THAT
[59:34] VOID AND THAT DESPERATION IS FILLED BY
[59:36] LOT.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; There has to be A SEPARATION. IT'S NOT
[59:41] THAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE promised son.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; It's not that he doesn't believe in the
[59:45] promised son, BUT THE FULFILLMENT OF THE
[59:48] PROMISE EXACTLY HOW GOD GAVE IT MUST
[59:51] BECOME HIS ONLY HOPE.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; IT MUST BE THE ONLY WAY TO FULFILL IT.
[59:57] IT MUST BECOME HIS ONLY OPTION. ALL OF
[1:00:00] HIS FAITH MUST LAY IN THE PROMISE WITH
[1:00:03] NO OPTION OF FULFILLING IT A DIFFERENT
[1:00:05] WAY OTHER THAN HOW GOD HAS PROMISED IT.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; LOT CAN'T BE AN OPTION,
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; BUT ONLY THE PROMISED SON. AND THIS
[1:00:14] SEPARATION MAKES IT CLEAR HERE THAT THAT
[1:00:17] THE PROMISE WOULD NOT COME THROUGH LOT
[1:00:19] AND IT WASN'T GOING TO COME THROUGH
[1:00:20] HAGAR, BUT IT WAS GOING TO COME THROUGH
[1:00:22] A SON BY ABRAHAM AND SARAH EXACTLY THE
[1:00:26] WAY GOD SAID IT WOULD. AMEN.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't understand
[1:00:34] why is this person being pulled out of
[1:00:36] my life?
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Why is this friendship being torn AWAY
[1:00:39] FROM ME?
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; WHY ISN'T THIS JOB WORKING OUT?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Why do we have TO MOVE HERE? AND WHY DO
[1:00:47] WE HAVE TO LEAVE THIS BEHIND? AND WHY IS
[1:00:49] THAT PERSON SUDDENLY COLD TOWARDS ME?
[1:00:52] WHY THIS TRIAL? WHY THIS HURT? WHY ARE
[1:00:55] ALL THINGS DOING THIS? AND THE WHOLE
[1:00:57] TIME, GOD IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT
[1:00:59] YOU'RE IN POSITION TO RECEIVE THE
[1:01:02] PROMISE.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; HE'S MAKING SURE THAT HE'S REMOVING
[1:01:06] OBSTACLES OUT OF YOUR LIFE. AND YOU MAY
[1:01:08] NOT RECOGNIZE IT AS AN OBSTACLE, BUT
[1:01:11] ABRAM'S LOT LOVE FOR LOT WAS AN
[1:01:13] OBSTACLE.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Then God's JUST MOVING YOU INTO POSITION
[1:01:18] THAT YOU CAN FULLY BE BLESSED AND FULLY
[1:01:21] RECEIVE THE PROMISE THE WAY GOD INTENDED
[1:01:23] IT FOR.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Making sure
[1:01:27] that you're not too comfortable where
[1:01:28] you're at.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Making sure that you're NOT TOO
[1:01:31] COMFORTABLE IN YOUR CURRENT situation to
[1:01:34] be desperate.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; It's hard to be desperate when things
[1:01:38] are going perfect.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD TO BE DESPERATE WHEN EVERY
[1:01:41] DECISION YOU MAKE LINES UP PERFECT AND
[1:01:43] it's blessing after blessing after
[1:01:44] blessing after blessing. Woo!
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD TO BE DESPERATE.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT GOD WANTS HIS PEOPLE DESPERATE
[1:01:51] FOR FULFILLMENT, DESPERATE FOR THE
[1:01:53] RETURN OF CHRIST, DESPERATE FOR THE BODY
[1:01:56] CHANGE, DESPERATE FOR THE PRODALS,
[1:01:58] DESPERATE FOR MIRACLES, DESPERATE FOR
[1:02:00] HIM TO FULFILL HIS WORD. NOT COMFORTABLE
[1:02:02] WHERE WE ARE, BUT DESPERATE TONIGHT. GOD
[1:02:05] MOVE IN OUR LIVES.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to have a fallback
[1:02:11] plan.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to have a plan B.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; You're right. He wants your faith and
[1:02:18] your trust totally in him.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; If he has to take away earthly comfort,
[1:02:23] so be it.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; If he has to take away friends,
[1:02:28] so be it.
[1:02:32] Now, it's not that easy for us, and I
[1:02:35] don't say that
[1:02:37] in a way that those things don't hurt,
[1:02:39] but the way God looks at it, if this is
[1:02:41] what it takes
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; to get you here.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, no matter how horrible
[1:02:47] it sounds, so be it.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; If he has to end relationships,
[1:02:53] so be it. If he has to put you through
[1:02:55] tough decisions that put you in really
[1:02:58] difficult situations,
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; so be it. Whatever it takes for you to
[1:03:04] get desperate for him,
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; desperate to be obedient.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; How many times
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; do we just roll along along and and and
[1:03:14] and those little nudges and you don't
[1:03:17] really pay attention to them and you
[1:03:18] just keep rolling
[1:03:21] and God has to bring something in your
[1:03:22] life that makes you slow down and pay
[1:03:25] attention to those little nudges. Pay
[1:03:27] attention to Lord, HAVE I MISSED YOU? H
[1:03:29] HAVE I GONE WRONG? HAVE Have I not given
[1:03:31] YOU THE THE THE TIME AND THE EFFORT THAT
[1:03:34] I SHOULD HAVE? HAVE I BEEN disobedient
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; and put YOU IN A PLACE WHERE YOU'RE
[1:03:38] DESPERATE FOR OBEDIENCE? Desperate for
[1:03:40] him TO FULFILL HIS WORD, DESPERATE FOR
[1:03:42] GOD TO MOVE IN OUR LIVES.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IT TAKES. SO THAT WHEN YOUR
[1:03:47] STORY IS READ ON THAT DAY, IT'LL SAY HE
[1:03:50] BELIEVED GOD AND IT WAS IMPUTED UNTO
[1:03:52] HIM.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:56] Once the separation is complete,
[1:04:00] immediately God comes and immediately he
[1:04:04] reaffirms and even expands his covenant
[1:04:06] promises.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Look in verse 14. And the Lord said unto
[1:04:10] Abram
[1:04:12] after that Lot was separated from him,
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; lift up now thine eyes,
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; and look from the place where thou art,
[1:04:22] northward, southward, eastward,
[1:04:23] westward, for all the land which thou
[1:04:25] seeest to thee will I give it, and to
[1:04:28] thy seed forever.
[1:04:31] So there's separation here. It sets the
[1:04:34] stage for chapter 14 and and Abram's
[1:04:38] meeting with Melzdc.
[1:04:41] Lot had moved on down to Sodom and and
[1:04:43] during this time war breaks out amongst
[1:04:46] the kings
[1:04:48] and it was a conflict
[1:04:51] between two different coalitions of of
[1:04:53] kings. And I don't expect you to really
[1:04:57] be able to pronounce all these. I
[1:04:58] struggled with. I looked at them over
[1:05:00] and over a day and I was like, "Wow, I
[1:05:01] just if I say them real fast and
[1:05:03] confidently, maybe they won't know."
[1:05:07] But you had the Mesopotamian coalition,
[1:05:09] which was the four kings. They were led
[1:05:12] by Keor Lmer.
[1:05:18] Lawmer, that was it. Keto Lawmer. Yeah.
[1:05:21] King of Elum. The king of Elum is the
[1:05:24] leader and he's the primary power and
[1:05:27] and with him there's Amrifale king of
[1:05:29] Shannar, Ariotch king of Elazar, Title
[1:05:32] the king of nations and then the Jordan
[1:05:34] Valley Alliance which is five kings.
[1:05:36] It's Barra king of Sidum, Bersa king of
[1:05:39] Gomorra, Shannab king of Adma, Shim
[1:05:42] Shimber king of Zebulun and then the
[1:05:45] king of Bala. And these five kings had
[1:05:49] been subject to the king of Elum.
[1:05:52] And they had paid him tribute for 12
[1:05:54] years. But on the 13th year, these five
[1:05:56] kings rebelled.
[1:05:58] And they said they wouldn't pay tribute
[1:06:00] anymore. And so and so the king of Elum
[1:06:03] gets him an alliance of these four kings
[1:06:06] and and they invade the valley.
[1:06:09] And all this you can read in chapter 14.
[1:06:12] And the king of Elum and his allies
[1:06:13] march in to crush the rebellion and to
[1:06:16] reestablish their dominance. And there's
[1:06:19] quite a few smaller battles and
[1:06:21] skirmishes, but the main battle is known
[1:06:23] as the battle of the veil of Sadine.
[1:06:27] And the five kings of the valley are no
[1:06:29] match for the invaders.
[1:06:31] And the king of Elum and his allies
[1:06:33] crush the valley kings. And the
[1:06:35] victorious armies then plunder Sodom and
[1:06:37] they plunder Gomorra. And they they take
[1:06:39] all their goods. They take all their
[1:06:41] food. They take all the people captive.
[1:06:44] And among those captives is Lot.
[1:06:47] Yes.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; And it says that one escaped from
[1:06:51] captivity and comes to Abraham.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; And it says, "And there came one that
[1:06:56] had escaped and told a and told Abram
[1:06:59] the Hebrew, for he dwelt in the plain of
[1:07:02] Mamry, the Amorite, brother of Echel,
[1:07:04] brother of Anor. And these were
[1:07:06] confederate with Abram. And when Abram
[1:07:08] heard that his brother was taken
[1:07:10] captive, he armed his trained servants,
[1:07:12] born in his own house, 318, and pursued
[1:07:16] them unto Dan. And he divided himself
[1:07:19] against them, he and his servants by
[1:07:20] night, and smokeote them, and pursued
[1:07:23] them unto Hoba, which is on the left
[1:07:25] hand of Damascus. AND HE BROUGHT BACK
[1:07:27] ALL THE GOODS, and also brought AGAIN
[1:07:29] HIS BROTHER LOT, and his goods, and the
[1:07:32] women also, and the people.
[1:07:35] And I love how in the scripture through
[1:07:38] different Bible characters, we can see
[1:07:40] we can see the spirit of Christ
[1:07:41] manifested.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; And we learn here that God IS A GOD THAT
[1:07:46] PURSUES.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I if you've BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE
[1:07:50] TONIGHT, IF YOUR LOVED ONES BEEN TAKEN
[1:07:52] CAPTIVE, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY
[1:07:54] kings there are. It doesn't matter how
[1:07:56] many demons THAT HAVE TAKEN HOLD. IT
[1:07:58] DOESN'T MATTER THE CONDITION OF YOUR
[1:08:00] LOVED ONE TONIGHT. ODDS DON'T MATTER.
[1:08:02] ABRAHAM HAD 300 men and he was going
[1:08:05] against four kings and FOUR ARMIES THAT
[1:08:07] HAD JUST CONQUERED FIVE KINGS AND FIVE
[1:08:09] ARMIES. BUT GOD WAS ON HIS SIDE AND
[1:08:12] ABRAHAM PURSUED AFTER IT TONIGHT. AND IT
[1:08:15] SHOWED HIS NATURE. I'M NOT GOING TO LET
[1:08:17] YOU GO. I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOUR
[1:08:19] CHILDREN GO.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; OH MY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT LOOKS
[1:08:22] LIKE TONIGHT.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE DEVILS JUST WON
[1:08:25] A BATTLE IN YOUR HOME. AMEN.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE DEVILS JUST WON
[1:08:31] A BATTLE IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. THE ENEMY HAD JUST
[1:08:35] BURNED ZIGLAG. THAT WAS A VICTORY for
[1:08:37] the enemy and they TOOK DAVID'S WIFE.
[1:08:40] THEY HAD COME AND THEY HAD CONQUERED ALL
[1:08:42] THESE KINGS AND AND IT WAS A VICTORY FOR
[1:08:44] THEM. BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER. THEY JUST
[1:08:46] WON A VICTORY. THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE
[1:08:48] SLAUGHTERED. HALLELUJAH. ABRAHAM GOES
[1:08:51] AFTER HIS BROTHER LOT AND HE SLAUGHTERS
[1:08:53] THE KING THERE.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, maybe you've been down. Maybe
[1:08:57] the family's in turmoil. Maybe your
[1:08:59] children are in disarray. MAYBE YOUR
[1:09:01] JOYY'S BEEN STOLEN AND PEACE HAS BEEN
[1:09:03] STOLEN. YOUR HEALTH HAS BEEN STOLEN. GOD
[1:09:06] WANTS US TO PURSUE TONIGHT.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; David went to HIM AND SAID, "SHALL I
[1:09:11] PURSUE?" AND GOD ANSWERED BACK,
[1:09:13] "PURSUE."
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; It's the nature of God.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; He wants us to pursue the promise.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; He wants us to put the word ON OUR LIPS
[1:09:22] AND TAKE BACK OUR PROMISES. TAKE BACK
[1:09:25] OUR FAMILY. GO AFTER OUR CHILDREN
[1:09:27] TONIGHT.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; OUR GOD PURSUES.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; YOUR CHILDREN'S OUT THERE TONIGHT, DON'T
[1:09:34] GIVE UP. GOD'S PURSUE. SEND MERCY AND
[1:09:36] GRACE ON THEIR TRAIL TONIGHT. MERCY AND
[1:09:39] GRACE WILL OVERTAKE THEM.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SITUATION, THIS SITUATION DIDN'T
[1:09:43] LOOK GOOD EITHER.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; But our God pursues.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what happened in the
[1:09:51] beginning
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; when news reached glory that man had
[1:09:54] failed.
[1:09:57] and fear spread.
[1:09:59] There was Christ who said, "I will
[1:10:01] pursue."
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; He came and won everything back for man.
[1:10:05] He pursued the enemy all the way to hell
[1:10:08] to restore back what was lost. I found
[1:10:10] this quote and I loved it so much.
[1:10:12] Brother Brandon says, "What a beautiful
[1:10:14] picture of Christ." He's talking about
[1:10:15] Abram who heard from heaven that we WERE
[1:10:18] LOST AND HE CAME AND PURSUED THE ENEMY
[1:10:20] ALL THE WAY TO HELL AND CAPTURED the
[1:10:23] lost souls and brought us back and
[1:10:25] restored us to everything that we had
[1:10:26] before the fall. We
[1:10:29] backsliders.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; We that was born to be sons of God
[1:10:33] that's perverted into the sons OF THE
[1:10:35] DEVIL WENT AFTER THE THINGS OF THE WORLD
[1:10:37] DONE WRONG. RUN GREEDILY LIKE LOT DID.
[1:10:40] SOLD OUT OUR BIRTHRIGHTS TO GO AFTER THE
[1:10:42] THINGS OF the world. CHRIST CAME DOWN.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; OH, THOUGH FALLEN, GOD KNOWING IN THE
[1:10:48] BEGINNING WHO WOULD BE SAVED AND WHO
[1:10:50] WOULD NOT. THEREFORE, COME DOWN AND
[1:10:52] PURSUE THE ENEMY THROUGH LIFE, THROUGH
[1:10:54] DEATH, THROUGH PARADISE, INTO HELL, ALL
[1:10:57] THE WAY FROM GLORY TO HELL AND TOOK OVER
[1:11:00] THE POWERS OF HELL AND THE KEYS AWAY
[1:11:02] FROM THE DEVIL AND ROSE AGAIN AND
[1:11:04] RESTORED TO MANKIND THAT HE CAN BE SONS
[1:11:07] AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD AGAIN. THERE IS NO
[1:11:11] LINK. THERE [cheering] IS NO LINK THAT
[1:11:13] HE WILL STOP AT TO REDEEM YOUR SOUL.
[1:11:17] [applause]
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; HE CAME FROM GLORY ALL THE WAY TO HELL.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; OH, there's nothing too hard for our
[1:11:24] God.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; There's nothing too extreme. THERE'S
[1:11:27] NOTHING TOO DIFFICULT. THERE'S NO
[1:11:29] PROMISE HE WON'T KEEP. THERE'S NO
[1:11:31] GARRISON OF DEMONS THAT CAN STOP HIM. NO
[1:11:34] MOUNTAIN HE WON'T CLIMB UP. NO WALL. NO
[1:11:37] LIE. THERE'S NOTHING. WHAT DID HE DO? HE
[1:11:40] WENT FROM GLORY TO HELL FOR YOU TONIGHT.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR CHILD, HE WENT.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR SITUATION, he went.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, it looked bad. It looked like THE
[1:11:52] DEVIL HAD WON. BUT OUR GOD PURSUED.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; The devil had not won. The kings have
[1:12:00] not won. As a matter of fact, they're
[1:12:02] about to receive THEIR GREATEST DEFEAT.
[1:12:05] ALL THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN. ALL THAT HAS
[1:12:08] BEEN taken is going to be restored.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Verse 17.
[1:12:16] And the king of Sodom, and this is after
[1:12:19] the battle,
[1:12:21] and Abraham's won the battle.
[1:12:24] He's got all the goods.
[1:12:27] And the king of Sodom went out to meet
[1:12:29] him after his return from the slaughter.
[1:12:32] and of the kings that were with him at
[1:12:35] the valley of Sheva, which is the king's
[1:12:37] dale. And notice who's with him.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And Melzdc,
[1:12:43] king of Salem, brought forth bread and
[1:12:46] wine, and he was the priest of the most
[1:12:48] high God. And he blessed him and said,
[1:12:50] "Blessed be Abram of the most high God,
[1:12:52] possessor of the heaven and earth. And
[1:12:54] blessed be the most high God, which hath
[1:12:57] delivered thy enemies into thy hand."
[1:12:59] and he gave him tithes
[1:13:02] of all.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; I want to look into this for a bit.
[1:13:06] First of all, just so we understand who
[1:13:08] we're dealing with, I want to establish
[1:13:11] who was this Melzdc.
[1:13:13] It's the title of a sermon. Who is this
[1:13:15] Melzdc? It's wonderful. You should
[1:13:16] listen to it. Hebrews 7 and1.
[1:13:22] For this Melzdc, king of Salem, priest
[1:13:25] of the most high God, who met Abraham,
[1:13:27] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:13:28] kings, and blessed him, to whom also
[1:13:30] Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first
[1:13:33] being by interpretation king of
[1:13:35] righteousness, and after that also king
[1:13:38] of Salem, which is king of peace,
[1:13:42] without father, without mother, without
[1:13:45] descent, having neither beginning of
[1:13:47] days, nor end of life, but made like
[1:13:49] unto the Son of God, abideth a priest
[1:13:53] continually.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; This is what your prophet says about
[1:13:56] miser all from the same sermon. And the
[1:13:59] person is eternal. If you notice, he had
[1:14:01] no father. He had no mother. He had no
[1:14:03] time. He ever began. He had no time. He
[1:14:05] ever ended. And ever who it was is still
[1:14:08] alive tonight
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; because the Bible said here that he had
[1:14:11] neither father nor mother, beginning of
[1:14:13] days or ending of life.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; His first being was spirit, God,
[1:14:18] supernatural. All right? The great
[1:14:20] eternal. Second, he began to form
[1:14:22] himself towards flesh
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; in a theophony. It's called the word, a
[1:14:27] body. This then is the state he was in
[1:14:30] when he met Abraham was called Melzdc.
[1:14:33] He was in the form of theophony.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; He was at the beginning the word and
[1:14:38] immorate body. He came in and lived in
[1:14:40] that in the person of Melzdc. Then later
[1:14:43] we never heard no more melazedc because
[1:14:46] he became Jesus Christ.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. says, he says, "But this man had
[1:14:50] NO FATHER OR HAD NO MOTHER." Jesus had a
[1:14:54] time he started. This man didn't. Jesus
[1:14:57] gave his life. This man couldn't because
[1:14:59] he was life.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; So, it would have to be an eternal
[1:15:04] person. Is that right? An eternal
[1:15:05] person. SO, IT CAN ONLY BE ONE PERSON.
[1:15:08] That's God.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's the ONLY ONE THAT'S ETERNAL.
[1:15:12] GOD. WHO IS THIS Melzdc
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; but God?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Here he is and he he's
[1:15:20] unfolding.
[1:15:22] He's prefiguring
[1:15:24] God in a body. No beginning of days, no
[1:15:27] ending of life.
[1:15:29] And Melzdc
[1:15:31] presents himself to Abram with the other
[1:15:34] kings.
[1:15:36] Notice just just to establish that they
[1:15:39] come at the same time because in verse
[1:15:41] 17 it says the king of Sodom went out to
[1:15:43] meet him after his return from the
[1:15:44] slaughter. Verse 18. And Melzdc, king of
[1:15:48] Salem, brought forth bread and wine. And
[1:15:50] just so we see that the king of Sodom
[1:15:52] hasn't left and that they're all there.
[1:15:55] In verse 21, the king of Sodom begins to
[1:15:57] speak. And the king of Sodom said unto
[1:16:00] Abram,
[1:16:03] "Give me the persons and take the goods
[1:16:06] to thyself."
[1:16:08] He offers him a reward.
[1:16:12] And Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I
[1:16:15] have lift up my hand unto the Lord the
[1:16:18] most high God, the possessor of heaven
[1:16:20] and earth, that I will not take from a
[1:16:23] thread even to a shoe latchet, and that
[1:16:26] I will not take anything that is thine,
[1:16:29] lest thou should say, I have made Abram
[1:16:32] rich."
[1:16:33] I want you to notice something in these
[1:16:35] actions
[1:16:37] in Abraham's actions to where he takes
[1:16:40] the communion from
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Melzdc.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; He takes that communion
[1:16:46] and then he rejects the king of Sodom.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Abraham shows where his loyalty is and
[1:16:52] also the current condition of his faith,
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; where his faith is at currently. It
[1:16:59] shows that he knows where his blessings
[1:17:01] come from. THAT'S WHY HE gives him the
[1:17:03] tithes.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; He knows where HIS BLESSINGS COME FROM.
[1:17:06] AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT he knows there's
[1:17:08] more to come. THERE ARE MORE PROMISES TO
[1:17:12] BE FULFILLED. AND THAT'S WHAT Abram is
[1:17:14] looking to in this moment. HE DOESN'T
[1:17:16] GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HERE AND NOW.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE THE
[1:17:20] POSSIBILITY OF A REWARD HERE. The king
[1:17:24] comes out and HE ACCEPTS WHAT MELZDC
[1:17:27] GIVES HIM. HE TAKES THE bread and wine.
[1:17:30] He communes with Melzdc. And in
[1:17:32] recognition of where his blessings come
[1:17:34] from AND WHERE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO
[1:17:36] come from, he offers tithes of
[1:17:38] everything. But then he turns TO THE
[1:17:41] KING OF SODOM AND HE REJECTS HIS OFFER.
[1:17:44] HE REJECTS his gifts and all the spools
[1:17:46] AND HE SAYS, "I WON'T TAKE anything from
[1:17:49] you."
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; OH MY CHURCH. WE DON'T NEED THE REWARDS
[1:17:53] OF SODOM. WE DON'T NEED WHAT THIS WORLD
[1:17:56] CAN OFFER US TONIGHT. ABRAHAM KNEW HE
[1:17:59] WAS BLESSED. HE KNEW THERE WAS MORE
[1:18:01] COMING. HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE RICH.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO POSSESS THE
[1:18:06] LAND.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; AND HE KNEW WHY. CHURCH, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:18:10] BE BLESSED. YOU'RE [screaming] GOING TO
[1:18:12] OVERCOME. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT.
[1:18:14] YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE AND YOUR
[1:18:16] OFFSPRING WITH YOU. AND WE KNOW WHY
[1:18:18] TONIGHT. IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM TONIGHT.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:24] HE SAYS, "GOD DID THIS.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; God brought the victory."
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; And he's making sure in this moment that
[1:18:32] all credit FOR ALL HIS BLESSINGS AND FOR
[1:18:35] ALL HIS wealth remained with God.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; They're not going to be able to say, "I
[1:18:41] got one thing from you."
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHERE MY BLESSING COMES FROM.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; He's going to receive all the credit. He
[1:18:50] didn't want a claim on his life, Brother
[1:18:51] Tim. HE DIDN'T WANT SODOM TO BE ABLE TO
[1:18:54] SAY, "YEAH, BUT I GAVE YOU THIS."
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; "YEAH, BUT I DID THAT FOR YOU."
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT? HE DIDN'T WANT
[1:18:59] SODOM COMING AFTER HIS KIDS YEARS DOWN
[1:19:02] THE ROAD WITH A CLAIM SAYING, "YEAH, BUT
[1:19:04] YOUR DADDY DID THIS AND YOUR DADDY DID
[1:19:07] THAT." THERE WAS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL
[1:19:09] REJECTION OF SODOM AND SODOM'S IDEAS.
[1:19:12] DADDIES, IT'S TIME TO REJECT SODOM.
[1:19:15] REJECT THE IDEAS OF SODOM. HAVE NO CLAIM
[1:19:18] ON YOUR HOME. HAVE NO CLAIM ON YOUR
[1:19:20] CHILDREN. HAVE NO CLAIM AT ALL EXCEPT
[1:19:23] THE CLAIM MADE BY Jesus Christ.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Abram made sure there were no claims.
[1:19:31] God called me.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; God placed me. God is providing for me.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; And here Abraham reaffirms his trust
[1:19:43] that God alone is his provider and God
[1:19:46] alone is his exceeding great reward.
[1:19:49] Abraham refuses in this moment to be
[1:19:51] entangled by Sodom.
[1:19:54] And by refusing wealth from the kings,
[1:19:56] he sets a very clear boundary that he
[1:19:58] will not be entangled and therefore he
[1:20:00] will not be influenced by Sodom.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Sodom rewards do nothing but bring an
[1:20:05] influence into your life.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Sodom offers pleasures. Now
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; it offers an easier way. It offers less
[1:20:12] commitment. It offers less sincerity. It
[1:20:15] offers you a way to fit in at school. It
[1:20:18] offers you A WAY TO QUICKLY advance at
[1:20:20] work.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; It offers you the pleasures of sin for a
[1:20:23] season.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; But it's time we declare THIS WORLD WILL
[1:20:26] HAVE NO CLAIM ON MY LIFE. WHAT I GET AT
[1:20:29] WORK WILL BE BECAUSE GOD BLESSED ME AT
[1:20:30] WORK. WHAT I GET IN THIS WORLD WILL BE
[1:20:33] BECAUSE GOD BLESSED ME WITH IT. BUT I
[1:20:35] WILL NOT BEND. I WILL NOT BOW. I WILL
[1:20:37] NOT LOWER STANDARDS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE
[1:20:39] FROM THE KINGS OF SODOM.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:44] I'm going to be faithful to God and
[1:20:46] allow him to bless me as he sees fit
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; with the rewards that he sees fit for my
[1:20:52] life because our God is a God who
[1:20:54] rewards
[1:20:56] those who diligently seek him.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to get our eyes back on the
[1:21:02] promise.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; And don't forget,
[1:21:05] there is a promise that we receive at
[1:21:07] the end just like Abraham. But we've got
[1:21:11] to recognize the blessings that we
[1:21:13] receive along the way.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us, "Bless the Lord,
[1:21:18] oh my soul, all that is within me. Bless
[1:21:21] his holy name. Bless the Lord, OH MY
[1:21:23] SOUL, AND FORGET NOT ALL HIS BENEFITS.
[1:21:27] Who forgiveth all thine iniquities. Who
[1:21:29] healthth all thy diseases. Who redeemth
[1:21:31] THY LIFE FROM DESTRUCTION. WHO CROWNETH
[1:21:34] THEE WITH LOVING KINDNESS AND TENDER
[1:21:35] MERCIES. WHO SATISFYTH THY MOUTH WITH
[1:21:38] GOOD THINGS SO THAT THY YOUTH is renewed
[1:21:40] like the eagles.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, WE WANT THE FINAL REWARD. BUT AS
[1:21:45] WE FIGHT AND AS WE JOURNEY AND AS WE
[1:21:48] PRESS TOWARDS THAT, FORGET NOT ALL HIS
[1:21:51] BENEFITS.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; HE PROMISES JOY AND HE GIVES IT. HE
[1:21:55] PROMISES PEACE AND HE GIVES IT. HE
[1:21:57] PROMISES HEALING AND HE GIVES IT.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Our God is NOT SLACK CONCERNING HIS
[1:22:03] PROMISES. HE'S with us every STEP OF THE
[1:22:05] WAY. I SAY, WHAT AN AWESOME GOD WE
[1:22:08] SERVE.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; WHAT A MIGHTY GOD THAT WE SERVE. AMEN.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; It's time that WE BEGIN TO HAVE RESPECT
[1:22:14] UNTO THE recompense of THE REWARD.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; LOOK PAST THE CIRCUMSTANCE. LOOK PAST
[1:22:19] EARTHLY PRESSURE, earthly pleasure
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; and begin to keep our eyes on the
[1:22:25] promise.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Reject doubt. Reject unbelief. Reject
[1:22:29] Sodom and get a hold on the promise
[1:22:32] tonight. No matter KNOWING THAT NO
[1:22:34] MATTER WHAT SODOM OFFERS,
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT YOU OFFER ME IN THIS
[1:22:39] LIFE, THE REWARD I'M GOING TO GET IS
[1:22:41] GREATER.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT MOSES KNEW. THAT'S WHAT
[1:22:45] ABRAHAM KNEW. NO MATTER WHAT THEY CAN
[1:22:47] OFFER ME, THAT IS GREATER.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; That's what Moses did. He looked to
[1:22:54] God's reward. [snorts]
[1:22:56] says, "By faith, Moses, when he was come
[1:22:58] to years, refused to be called the son
[1:23:01] of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather
[1:23:03] to suffer affliction with the people of
[1:23:05] God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[1:23:07] for a season." Sodom's reward.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[1:23:16] riches than the treasures in Egypt,
[1:23:18] Sodom's reward,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; for he had respect unto the recompense
[1:23:24] of the reward. Amen.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; You study a little bit and it's believed
[1:23:29] that Pharaoh's daughter was an only
[1:23:31] child
[1:23:33] and she herself was childless.
[1:23:36] Moses was in line to be the Pharaoh.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Think about that temptation.
[1:23:42] Not a CEO,
[1:23:45] not a powerful business owner, the most
[1:23:48] powerful man in the world,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; right at his fingertips.
[1:23:54] Think about the justification he could
[1:23:56] have used. Oh, I can really help Israel
[1:23:59] more from a position of power.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; I I I can do this and then I can work in
[1:24:04] a way and I can I can ease their bonds
[1:24:06] and I can I can free them with this
[1:24:09] power.
[1:24:10] But in order to do that, he'd have to be
[1:24:12] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; And he refused to be called the son of
[1:24:17] Pharaoh's daughter because he couldn't
[1:24:19] be that and a son of Abraham.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:24] You can't be of this world and a child
[1:24:26] of God.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; You got to make a decision tonight. You
[1:24:29] got to pick one or the other. Where am I
[1:24:31] at? WHAT AM I GOING TO BE? WHAT AM I
[1:24:33] GOING TO STAND FOR? HE COULDN'T BE THAT
[1:24:35] AND PART OF THE PROMISE.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; It's time to put things in the scales.
[1:24:39] IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT the things that
[1:24:41] that we choose and the things that WE DO
[1:24:43] AND AND COMPARE THEM TO THE PROMISE.
[1:24:45] COMPARE THEM TO DO WE HAVE RESPECT UNTO
[1:24:48] THE RECOMPENSE OF THE REWARD? DO WE
[1:24:50] RECOGNIZE WHAT IT IS WE'RE FIGHTING FOR?
[1:24:52] DO WE RECOGNIZE WHAT IT IS WE'RE
[1:24:54] STRIVING FOR?
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; AND SO MANY TIMES WE THROW OFF ON PEOPLE
[1:24:58] LIKE ELVIS AND SAY HE SOLD OUT FOR A
[1:25:00] FLEET OF CADILLACS AND THERE'S MANY WHO
[1:25:02] SELL OUT FOR WAY LESS.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; What is the reward at the end?
[1:25:10] He chose rather to suffer affliction
[1:25:12] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:25:15] pleasures of sin for a season. In other
[1:25:17] words, he was willing to pay take his
[1:25:19] part with the people of God here.
[1:25:22] Though it was a suffering part,
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; though it was a suffering lot, that he
[1:25:26] might have his portion with them
[1:25:29] eternally.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; He rejected Sodom's offer because he
[1:25:35] knew that the reward of God was so much
[1:25:37] greater. Maybe you're suffering now,
[1:25:40] maybe struggling now, maybe hardships
[1:25:42] now,
[1:25:44] AND YOU OFFER A PALACE HERE NOW, AN EASY
[1:25:46] WAY OUT. BUT I KNOW WHAT'S COMING. I
[1:25:49] KNOW WHAT REWARDS ON THE WAY. AND IT'S
[1:25:51] SO MUCH GREATER THAN A LIFE OF EASE.
[1:25:53] IT'S SO MUCH GREATER THAN A JOB THAT
[1:25:56] TAKES ME OUT OF CHURCH. IT'S SO MUCH
[1:25:57] GREATER THAN CARS AND TRIPS AND TRAVEL
[1:25:59] AND ANYTHING SODOM CAN OFFER ME.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; I WILL NEVER PUT THOSE THINGS OVER
[1:26:04] SERVING THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; I know what's coming. I know the rapture
[1:26:10] is my reward. I KNOW THAT HEAVEN is our
[1:26:12] reward.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, we can't imagine how great heaven's
[1:26:17] going to be.
[1:26:18] I know heaven has to be suitable for the
[1:26:21] price that was paid.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; And the price that was paid was the
[1:26:24] blood of Jesus. So how amazing heaven
[1:26:28] must be,
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; HOW MARVELOUS, HOW wonderful
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Matthew Henry says this. He's a
[1:26:36] commentator on the Bible. He says this
[1:26:37] about heaven. He said, "Believers may
[1:26:40] and ought to have respect to this
[1:26:42] recompense of reward. They should
[1:26:45] acquaint themselves with it. approve of
[1:26:47] it and live in the daily and delightful
[1:26:50] expectation of it. Thus, it will prove a
[1:26:53] landmark to direct their course, a lone
[1:26:55] a load stone to draw their hearts, a
[1:26:58] sword to conquer THEIR ENEMIES, A SPUR
[1:27:00] TO QUICKEN them to duty, and a cordial
[1:27:02] to refresh them under all the
[1:27:04] difficulties of doing and suffering
[1:27:06] work. WHAT'S HE SAYING? ACQUAINT
[1:27:09] YOURSELF WITH THE REWARD. EXPECT IT.
[1:27:11] LIVE FOR IT. QUIT LIVING FOR WHAT'S HERE
[1:27:14] AND LIVE FOR THE REWARD THAT WE'RE GOING
[1:27:16] TO GAIN.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; I don't want to settle tonight
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; for temporary rewards.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; I have a promise of eternal rewards.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; No matter what comes my way, no matter
[1:27:29] the ups and the downs, no matter the
[1:27:31] circumstances, we judge him faithful
[1:27:34] tonight.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that he that made
[1:27:38] the promise is able to fulfill it.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He tells us
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; my we got to believe. We got to have
[1:27:45] faith. We got to trust. He tells us in
[1:27:47] Hebrews 11:6, "Without faith, it's
[1:27:50] impossible to please him. For he that
[1:27:51] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:27:53] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:27:56] diligently seek him.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; I know what's coming, church,
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; and I don't want any other reward."
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; I don't want nothing that sin can offer
[1:28:06] or Satan can offer or pleasure can
[1:28:08] offer. just the snares of life. Even if
[1:28:12] it's not sinful, I don't want to put
[1:28:13] those things in a place that it hinders
[1:28:16] me
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; to where I can't reach those rewards
[1:28:19] that are coming.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; This is this isn't about just being a
[1:28:23] good person.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; This isn't about just just going to
[1:28:27] church and and everybody thinks you're a
[1:28:29] great guy. That's not going to get you
[1:28:30] the reward.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO BE SOLD OUT FOR IT.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; We got to be all in for it.
[1:28:37] We got to run WITH OUR WHOLE HEART
[1:28:39] TONIGHT.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be tainted by the desire
[1:28:44] for popularity,
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; tainted by the desire for riches. I
[1:28:48] don't want it set of me that I've
[1:28:49] already received my reward.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Think about Jesus talking about the
[1:28:56] hypocrites and and the Pharisees and
[1:28:58] those that were bound up by religion and
[1:29:01] those who desired man's praise. And he
[1:29:04] says, "Take heed that you do not your
[1:29:05] arms before men to be seen of them."
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you have no reward of your
[1:29:11] father which is in heaven.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Now, why says, "Therefore, when thou
[1:29:15] doest thine arms, do not sound a trumpet
[1:29:17] before thee, as the hypocrites do in the
[1:29:19] synagogue and in the streets, that they
[1:29:21] may have glory of men." Notice where
[1:29:23] they want their reward from,
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; men.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; They want it here.
[1:29:30] And he says, "Verily I say unto you,
[1:29:33] they have their reward."
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be
[1:29:40] as hypocrites are, for they love to pray
[1:29:42] standing in the synagogues, in the
[1:29:44] corners of the streets, that they may be
[1:29:45] seen of men.
[1:29:48] Verily, I say unto you, they have their
[1:29:52] reward.
[1:29:55] Moreover, when you fast, be not as the
[1:29:57] hypocrites of a sad countenance, for
[1:29:59] they disfigure their faces, that they
[1:30:01] may appear unto men to fast. Verily, I
[1:30:03] say unto you, they have their reward.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; They're doing it for the wrong reasons.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; They're in church on Sunday for the
[1:30:12] wrong reasons.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; They do it for human recognition and
[1:30:15] human praise and earthly reward.
[1:30:18] And I found this so outstanding. If you
[1:30:21] look into the Greek,
[1:30:23] that saying there, they have their
[1:30:25] reward, and I'm not going to try to
[1:30:27] pronounce it in the Greek, but it comes
[1:30:29] from a term that means paid in full.
[1:30:34] The transaction is complete.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; They get nothing else.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; The transaction is complete.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; He's given you all you're going to get.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; He's sealed the book. He's moved on.
[1:30:50] Imagine
[1:30:53] if Moses had accepted the riches of
[1:30:55] Egypt.
[1:30:57] Imagine if Abraham had exacted the king
[1:31:00] had accepted the king's praise and the
[1:31:03] king's reward, the reward of men. It
[1:31:06] would be said they have their reward.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:31:14] But instead, Abraham paid him tithes.
[1:31:18] Abraham recognized his blessings.
[1:31:20] Abraham received the covenant and
[1:31:22] staggered not. Abraham fought the good
[1:31:24] fight and he remained true to the
[1:31:26] promised reward. The one that he
[1:31:28] couldn't see with his eyes. The one that
[1:31:30] he could only see through FAITH AND GOD
[1:31:32] SAW HIM RIGHT THERE TURNED DOWN THE
[1:31:34] REWARD OF THE KINGS. HE SAW MOSES TURN
[1:31:36] DOWN THE REWARDS OF EGYPT BECAUSE THEY
[1:31:39] HAD FAITH TO the reward THAT WAS COMING.
[1:31:42] SO BECAUSE THEY TURNED THAT DOWN AND
[1:31:44] THEY STOOD THERE, THEIR TRANSACTION
[1:31:46] WASN'T CLOSED, THEIR TRANSACTION WAS NOT
[1:31:49] CANCELLED BECAUSE IT WASN'T COMPLETE,
[1:31:51] THERE WAS A REWARD COMING. OH,
[1:31:54] HALLELUJAH. THERE'S A REWARD COMING FOR
[1:31:56] YOU TONIGHT. OH, EVEN THOUGH there were
[1:31:59] MESS UPS AND EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE
[1:32:00] FAILURES AND EVEN THOUGH SARAH WAS IN A
[1:32:02] BAD MOOD THAT DAY, ONE DAY WHEN IT WAS
[1:32:06] LEAST EXPECTED, Abraham lifted his eyes
[1:32:08] up in the tent door and here came three
[1:32:11] men walking. THERE WAS A TRANSACTION TO
[1:32:13] BE SETTLED. OH, HALLELUJAH. ONE DAY WHEN
[1:32:16] IT'S LEAST EXPECTED, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:32:18] LIFT YOUR EYES UP AND A LOVED ONE'S
[1:32:20] GOING TO APPEAR IN YOUR LIVING ROOM. A
[1:32:22] LOVED ONE'S GOING TO COME WALKING
[1:32:24] THROUGH THE DOOR. THERE'S A TRANSACTION
[1:32:26] TO BE SETTLED.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED OUR REWARD YET, BUT
[1:32:31] IT'S COMING. IT'S COMING. HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:35] [applause] There was a transaction.
[1:32:37] There was a promise to be received.
[1:32:39] There was a reward coming. Prophet of
[1:32:42] God says there that Melzdc met Abraham
[1:32:47] and Abraham paid ti to him. Amen.
[1:32:50] Abraham, the greatest man on the face of
[1:32:52] the earth, paid ti to Melzdc,
[1:32:56] the king of peace, the king of Salem,
[1:32:57] the king of righteousness, and he was a
[1:33:00] prince, he was a prince, he was a king,
[1:33:02] and he was the servant of the most high,
[1:33:04] which Jesus was. And when Abraham a few
[1:33:07] years later or not long after that when
[1:33:10] Lot had backslid and Sodom had been
[1:33:12] burnt and Abraham was left alone with
[1:33:14] Sarah out on the barren grounds on this
[1:33:17] journey when things get hard when
[1:33:20] nothing's going right when everything's
[1:33:23] going against you out on the barren
[1:33:24] grounds when their cattle was all dying
[1:33:27] from starvation. It looked like God had
[1:33:29] failed him. But he had a strong faith to
[1:33:32] believe. And one day, let it be today,
[1:33:34] Lord. He was sitting in the door of his
[1:33:37] tent under the big oak. It still stands
[1:33:39] in memorial TODAY AS IT'S CHARRED OVER
[1:33:41] AND HELD. AND THERE ABRAHAM SITTING IN
[1:33:43] THE DOOR OF his tent seen Melzdc coming
[1:33:46] to him.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TRANSACTION TO COMPLETE.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A REWARD TO SETTLE UP.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT MOMENT? HE
[1:33:55] CHANGED THEIR BODIES. HE REWARDED THEM
[1:33:57] FOR THEIR FAITH WITH THE CHANGE OF THEIR
[1:33:59] BODIES THAT THE PROMISED son could come.
[1:34:02] Church, we got the same thing coming.
[1:34:04] We're waiting on a PROMISED SON AND
[1:34:06] WE'VE BEEN HOLDING ON AND WE'VE BEEN
[1:34:07] BELIEVING AND WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING AND HE
[1:34:09] SAYS, "I'M COMING DOWN TO SETTLE THE
[1:34:11] TRANSACTION. I'M COMING DOWN TO REWARD
[1:34:13] YOU WITH MELZDC'S REWARD." OH, he says,
[1:34:17] "Church, he will have to change this
[1:34:19] physical being to let us be caught up.
[1:34:21] We can't go up THIS KIND OF BODY. HE
[1:34:23] WILL CHANGE OUR body in a moment. In a
[1:34:25] twinkling of an eye, WE'LL BE CAUGHT UP
[1:34:27] TOGETHER IN THE AIR TO meet the Lord IN
[1:34:29] THE AIR. I SAY, "LET THAT BE MY REWARD.
[1:34:32] THAT'S WHAT I'M HOLDING ON TO. THAT'S
[1:34:34] WHAT I'M FIGHTING FOR." THE REWARD OF A
[1:34:36] BODY CHANGE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; We're on a faith walk.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; And there are promises that have been
[1:34:45] made to you.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Promises that have not been fulfilled
[1:34:49] yet.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; It's okay to say that.
[1:34:53] Yet
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; some of you have held on for decades,
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; but we judge him faithful.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; We trust him to bring it to pass. We
[1:35:04] have faith and it's accounted unto us.
[1:35:06] I'm not settling for an earthly reward
[1:35:09] evening like tabernacle.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not settling for riches here. They
[1:35:14] have their reward.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; May that never be said of me.
[1:35:22] I don't want to just be religious.
[1:35:25] I want to be faithful.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; I want to have faith. I want to please
[1:35:30] God.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Moses refused the rewards that came with
[1:35:34] Egypt in order to receive the reward of
[1:35:36] Abraham's seed. That was greater to him.
[1:35:41] It's time we recognize what's coming.
[1:35:44] It's time we look to the promise and get
[1:35:45] our eyes off the here and now. all that
[1:35:48] the kings are offering, all that Sodom's
[1:35:51] offering you, all that the world's
[1:35:53] offering you, and and they're presenting
[1:35:54] all these rewards. And I say, I'm not
[1:35:57] taking my reward now. I have recompense
[1:36:00] to the reward. I'm not going to get tied
[1:36:03] down to Leodysa and tied down to a
[1:36:05] RELIGIOUS SPIRIT. WE'VE COME OUT OF HER.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT HIM STUCK ON MY FRONT PORCH
[1:36:11] KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. I WANT HIM TO COME
[1:36:13] IN LIKE MELZDC DID AND AND COMMUNE WITH
[1:36:16] ME. I WANT HIM TO BE MY PORTION. I WANT
[1:36:19] HIM TO BE MY REWARD. I WANT HIM TO FEEL
[1:36:22] WELCOME. I I WANT HIM TO COME INTO MY
[1:36:24] HEART. AND I I WANT ETERNITY.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HIM OUT THERE ON
[1:36:29] THE DOOR SAYING, "BUT I GO TO CHURCH.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; I I I TAKE MY KIDS TO CHURCH." NO, I
[1:36:35] WANT TO COMMUNE WITH CHRIST.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; I WANT THAT REWARD. I WANT TO LAY
[1:36:39] EVERYTHING OF THE WORLD DOWN. I WANT TO
[1:36:40] REJECT SODOM TODAY AND SAY, "LORD, YOU
[1:36:43] ARE MY GREAT REWARD. YOU ARE MY SHIELD.
[1:36:46] YOU ARE MY EVERYTHING. HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; OH, brother Brandham says,
[1:36:52] he says that's part of their inheritance
[1:36:54] that he has reserved for them. If they
[1:36:56] were willing to walk with him through
[1:36:58] the tools and snares of life and being
[1:37:00] an honor to him, he was going to reward
[1:37:03] them. He is not forgetful of our labor
[1:37:05] of love. God will always recompense us
[1:37:08] for our efforts to please him. He says,
[1:37:12] "Oh, cries the spirit, I see your
[1:37:14] poverty. I see your need. You haven't
[1:37:16] very much, if anything, to boast of.
[1:37:18] What you did have has been taken from
[1:37:20] you. You gladly gave up your possessions
[1:37:22] in exchange for eternal ones. You're
[1:37:24] laughed at. You're scorned. You don't
[1:37:26] have material resources to fall back on,
[1:37:28] but you're rich in spite of it all. Your
[1:37:31] security lies in him who is your shield
[1:37:33] and exceeding great reward. Your kingdom
[1:37:35] IS YET TO COME, BUT IT WILL COME, and it
[1:37:38] WILL BE AN EVERLASTING ONE. YES, I AM
[1:37:41] MINDFUL OF YOUR TRIALS AND WOES. I KNOW
[1:37:43] HOW HARD IT IS TO GET ALONG, BUT I WILL
[1:37:45] REMEMBER ALL OF THIS WHEN I RETURN TO
[1:37:48] claim you as my own. And then I will
[1:37:51] REWARD YOU,
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; CHURCH. HE HASN'T FORGOT ABOUT YOU. HE'S
[1:37:55] MINDFUL OF YOU. HE SEES WHERE YOU'RE AT
[1:37:57] AND HE SAYS, "I'M GOING TO REWARD YOU
[1:37:59] FOR ALL OF IT."
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; OH, this is the promise
[1:38:05] to all those who suffer with him here on
[1:38:07] earth. All those who endure patiently,
[1:38:09] knowing that God, the just judge, would
[1:38:11] reward them. They who gave up all for
[1:38:13] him and committed all to him will sit
[1:38:15] down in his throne and share in his
[1:38:17] glorious kingdom. Oh, we have a word for
[1:38:20] us all at this time. Hold fast.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Hold fast. Persevere. Don't give up. Put
[1:38:26] on the whole armor of God. Use every
[1:38:28] weapon he's given us. Use every gift AT
[1:38:30] OUR DISPOSAL AND LOOK AHEAD WITH JOY.
[1:38:33] LOOK PAST WHAT SODOM'S OFFERING YOU
[1:38:35] TONIGHT. LOOK PAST THE THINGS OF THE
[1:38:37] WORLD TONIGHT. LOOK AHEAD WITH JOY
[1:38:40] BECAUSE we're going to be crowned by him
[1:38:42] who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Such a promise, a reward, an eternal
[1:38:49] reward.
[1:38:51] Brother Brandham, I'm gonna close with
[1:38:53] this. Brother Brandon would take that
[1:38:56] meeting there that he had with Melzdc
[1:38:58] there in Genesis 14 where Melzdc serves
[1:39:01] him communion
[1:39:04] and then he would tie it over into the
[1:39:06] book of Mark where Jesus is taking
[1:39:09] communion with his disciples
[1:39:12] and and Jesus says and he said unto them
[1:39:14] this is my blood of the new testament
[1:39:16] which is shed for many verily I say unto
[1:39:19] you I will drink no more of the fruit of
[1:39:21] the vine until that day that I drink get
[1:39:24] new in the kingdom of God. And brother
[1:39:28] Brandham ties it in there with with
[1:39:30] Melzdc and he shows how that when this
[1:39:32] earthly battle is over, he's returning
[1:39:35] from the battle of the king's
[1:39:37] victorious.
[1:39:38] He said, "When this earthly battle over,
[1:39:40] when we go to that meeting in the air,
[1:39:42] then he will serve us the communion at
[1:39:45] the wedding supper."
[1:39:47] And he says, "But Melzdc, after his
[1:39:49] child Abraham had won the victory,
[1:39:51] Melzdc met him and gave him wine and
[1:39:54] bread, showing that after this earthly
[1:39:56] battle is over, we will meet him in the
[1:39:58] heavens and take the communion again.
[1:40:01] It'll be the wedding supper. I will not
[1:40:03] drink no more of the vine or eat the
[1:40:05] fruit until I eat it and drink it with
[1:40:06] you and new in my father's kingdom." Is
[1:40:08] that right? Notice again, Melzdc went to
[1:40:11] meet Abraham before he got back home.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a beautiful type here.
[1:40:17] We have Melzdc meeting Abraham before he
[1:40:20] got back home after the battle. We meet
[1:40:22] Jesus in the air
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; before we get home. Amen.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; After you've stood the test,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; after you've held out in faith,
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; after you've believed God and it's been
[1:40:33] imputed unto you for righteousness,
[1:40:36] after you've rejected the rewards of
[1:40:38] Sodom,
[1:40:39] Melzdc
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; will serve you communion.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the great high priest Melzdc
[1:40:46] will come someday and we'll eat the
[1:40:48] communion a new with him in the kingdom
[1:40:51] of God. One of these great glorious
[1:40:54] days. Oh, I'm so happy tonight to be in
[1:40:56] his kingdom. Yes, sir. Some great day,
[1:40:59] some marvelous day. Time shall be no
[1:41:03] more.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Church, God rewards faith.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; He rewards those that stand on the
[1:41:09] promise. those who are faithful and our
[1:41:12] God will repay.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; He's not going to be indebted to you.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; He's not going to be indebted to no man.
[1:41:19] Tonight, if I could just encourage you,
[1:41:21] seek that reward right there.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Lay everything here down and run with
[1:41:27] all your heart.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Seek that reward with all your heart.
[1:41:31] Seek after that with everything that's
[1:41:33] in you. He's our portion.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; He is our reward. He is our everything.
[1:41:39] And he offers it to you tonight.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; He offers communion to you tonight. And
[1:41:43] you stand in a place, many of you, where
[1:41:45] you got to make a choice.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Which reward?
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Which way am I going to go? I know
[1:41:51] reward I'm after.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; I'm seeking Melzdc's reward.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Will you stand together with me
[1:41:57] tonight?
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father,
[1:42:03] Lord, we're offered so much in this
[1:42:04] world, but Lord, the scriptures show how
[1:42:07] faithful you are. Lord, the scriptures
[1:42:10] show that every promise you ever gave
[1:42:11] you will fulfill. And you're just
[1:42:13] looking for somebody to hold on. You're
[1:42:15] looking for somebody who'll reject
[1:42:16] what's going on in this world and turn
[1:42:18] their whole heart to you. Lord, I lift
[1:42:20] my hand to you tonight and I say, Lord,
[1:42:22] that's me. Lord, forgive me, Lord, if I
[1:42:24] haven't, Lord, had enough respect, Lord,
[1:42:26] to the reward and the greatness of it
[1:42:28] and recognizing, Lord, what purchased
[1:42:30] that reward for me, Lord, that your
[1:42:32] blood purchased it, Lord, may I give you
[1:42:34] my everything tonight and my all in all,
[1:42:37] Lord, no matter what comes my way, Lord,
[1:42:39] may it be written of me that I, Lord, I
[1:42:41] staggered not at the promise. May it be
[1:42:43] written of me that I overcame by the
[1:42:45] word and by the blood of the lamb. Lord,
[1:42:48] I want to give you my everything
[1:42:49] tonight. Lord, as I seek that city whose
[1:42:52] builder and maker is God, Lord, you are
[1:42:55] our portion. You are our great and
[1:42:57] exceeding reward. Lord, may that satisfy
[1:43:00] our soul till that day when once again
[1:43:02] you serve us that communion, Lord, at
[1:43:04] the marriage supper of the lamb. Lord,
[1:43:06] thank you for your word. Thank you for
[1:43:08] how rich it is. Thank you, Lord, how a
[1:43:10] prophet came in this day and opened it
[1:43:12] all up to us. Lord, we thank you in the
[1:43:15] name of Jesus. We commit this service
[1:43:16] and these people into your hands in
[1:43:19] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
