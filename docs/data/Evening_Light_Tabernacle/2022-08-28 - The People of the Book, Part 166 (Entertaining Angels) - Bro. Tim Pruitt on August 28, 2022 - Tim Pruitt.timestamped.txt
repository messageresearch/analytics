[59:52] genesis chapter 18 i'd like to read from
[59:55] one down through the eighth verse
[59:58] and then we'll read from the book of
[1:00:00] hebrews but genesis 18 verse 1
[1:00:04] and the lord appeared unto him in the
[1:00:06] plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent
[1:00:08] door in the heat of the day
[1:00:11] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[1:00:13] lo behold
[1:00:14] and lo three men stood by him and when
[1:00:17] he saw them he ran to meet them from the
[1:00:19] tent door and bowed himself down toward
[1:00:21] the ground
[1:00:23] and said my lord if i now if now i have
[1:00:27] found favor in thy sight pass not away i
[1:00:31] pray thee from thy servant
[1:00:33] let a little water i pray you be fetched
[1:00:36] and wash your feet and and rest
[1:00:40] yourselves up under the tree and
[1:00:43] and i will um
[1:00:45] fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye
[1:00:47] your hearts and after that ye shall pass
[1:00:50] on for therefore you come to your
[1:00:53] servant and they said so do as thou has
[1:00:56] said
[1:00:57] and abraham hastened into the tent
[1:01:00] unto sarah and said make ready three
[1:01:04] three measures of fine meal kneaded and
[1:01:07] make cakes upon the heart
[1:01:09] and abraham ran unto the herd and
[1:01:12] fetched a calf
[1:01:14] tender and good and gave it to a young
[1:01:17] man and he hastened to dress it and he
[1:01:20] took butter and milk and the calf which
[1:01:22] he had dressed and set it before them
[1:01:24] and he stood by them under the tree
[1:01:26] and they did eat and then over hebrews
[1:01:29] chapter 13
[1:01:31] we'll read two verses there verse 1 and
[1:01:34] 2.
[1:01:36] let brotherly love
[1:01:38] continue
[1:01:40] be not forgetful to entertain strangers
[1:01:45] for thereby some have entertained
[1:01:48] angels
[1:01:49] unaware
[1:01:50] amen god bless you as your seater we're
[1:01:52] going to speak today on
[1:01:54] entertaining angels
[1:01:58] before the end time
[1:02:00] the bible said the days of lot would
[1:02:02] repeat
[1:02:05] and in that day god sent angels to get
[1:02:08] lot of course out of sodom that
[1:02:11] represented the church
[1:02:14] and god sent the angels to get the elect
[1:02:17] to believe in you see sarah
[1:02:19] had to get on board
[1:02:21] she had to get on board with the promise
[1:02:24] and start believing
[1:02:26] and because she had languished now for
[1:02:29] years and years and years and seemingly
[1:02:31] had given up on the promise
[1:02:34] but god had to get his people to believe
[1:02:36] them
[1:02:37] that's what god wants people to do in
[1:02:39] this age
[1:02:40] he wants people that will believe him
[1:02:43] and abraham was watching
[1:02:45] and all of all the experiences
[1:02:48] uh that he'd ever had in prior times he
[1:02:52] was about to be crowned with an
[1:02:54] experience where he was going to be
[1:02:56] changed to receive the promised son
[1:03:00] you look also in second timothy 4 and 8
[1:03:03] it talks about those that
[1:03:06] it says paul said there's a crown
[1:03:08] laid up for me of righteousness which
[1:03:11] the lord the righteous judge shall give
[1:03:13] me of that day and not to me only but to
[1:03:16] all them that also love his appearing
[1:03:21] so you see he appears to though that
[1:03:24] love his appearing
[1:03:26] now honestly sarah was out kind of out
[1:03:29] of sorts at this time she was not
[1:03:31] believing she was not expecting as
[1:03:33] abraham was he was sitting in the tent
[1:03:36] door he was looking out she was back in
[1:03:39] the tent and um
[1:03:41] and she she was maybe not having the
[1:03:44] same kind of expectation but the thing
[1:03:47] about it is is god will always get his
[1:03:49] elect on board
[1:03:53] some are expecting and watching and
[1:03:55] looking and anticipating and some maybe
[1:03:59] get caught up in laodicea in the age
[1:04:02] that we're living this time where it's
[1:04:04] lukewarmness that predominates the age
[1:04:07] that we have to fight against so hard
[1:04:10] and some will get caught up in that but
[1:04:12] nevertheless no matter where you're
[1:04:14] caught today and what snare you've been
[1:04:17] snared under god is here to deliver you
[1:04:21] and to get you on board you believe in
[1:04:24] remember those that were there in the
[1:04:26] scripture or actually in the vision of
[1:04:29] brother branham that they were out of
[1:04:30] step with the word and and how to step
[1:04:33] with the tune of the gospel you remember
[1:04:35] the preview of the bride and how that
[1:04:37] happened and
[1:04:38] and he saw some of them get out of step
[1:04:41] he never did say no no no you're not
[1:04:43] bribed
[1:04:44] so therefore you're you're rejected
[1:04:46] because you got as a step no they were
[1:04:48] bribed and they had to get in the step
[1:04:52] so you see the prophet's voice streamed
[1:04:54] out saying get back in line
[1:04:57] and that's what we want to do today if i
[1:04:59] know my heart i believe i know yours
[1:05:01] that that you want to be in line you
[1:05:04] want to be in step with what god is
[1:05:06] doing in this day in this hour
[1:05:08] and now brother branham would uh say
[1:05:11] uh concerning this visitation to abraham
[1:05:16] as he compared it with the days of sodom
[1:05:18] and he said
[1:05:20] he said the day of visitation is here
[1:05:23] and i believe that we are here in the
[1:05:25] one of the greatest outpourings of the
[1:05:27] holy spirit
[1:05:28] where that he is emptying out on all
[1:05:32] that he promised into this age remember
[1:05:35] all that was in god he poured into
[1:05:36] christ till it was the fullness of the
[1:05:39] godhead bodily and then you know again
[1:05:42] all that was in christ he pours into the
[1:05:45] church and he has been doing this to the
[1:05:47] through south 2000 years in the seven
[1:05:50] church ages but in the last days he
[1:05:52] pours out his fullness
[1:05:54] so what an hour that we're living in
[1:05:57] what a day there's not quite ever been a
[1:06:00] day like this day
[1:06:02] to to the gentile ages
[1:06:04] for we we are privileged people called
[1:06:08] for a specific time a specific purpose
[1:06:11] now in this we we see that god would be
[1:06:15] working through human flesh we have been
[1:06:17] through it of god changing his mask and
[1:06:20] him getting the calcium the polish the
[1:06:22] dust of the earth and and blowing into
[1:06:25] it and stepping into it
[1:06:27] but of course we know that god doesn't
[1:06:29] do it that way now not that he isn't the
[1:06:32] same because he still uses dust
[1:06:35] but he has got your dust that he is
[1:06:38] redeemed
[1:06:40] so therefore god is still stepping into
[1:06:42] dust
[1:06:43] you that just received the gift of the
[1:06:45] holy ghost that was god stepping into
[1:06:48] dust
[1:06:49] that was the holy spirit coming into you
[1:06:51] where god would be tabernacled in man
[1:06:55] you see god wants more than a tabernacle
[1:06:57] in heaven or a tabernacle that we build
[1:07:00] with hands this isn't worthy for him
[1:07:02] and our bodies wouldn't be worthy for
[1:07:05] him except that he sanctified it and
[1:07:08] then he cleansed with cleansing he could
[1:07:10] fill it with the holy ghost
[1:07:13] now so again the day of visitation is
[1:07:16] here but many think oh but god doesn't
[1:07:18] send angels anymore
[1:07:20] but but you see he does because he is
[1:07:23] still
[1:07:24] manifest himself the holy spirit is that
[1:07:28] angel that's what i want to get to you
[1:07:31] amen the holy spirit is that angel the
[1:07:33] holy spirit is that person
[1:07:37] amen so you see there there again when
[1:07:40] when you received the gift of the holy
[1:07:43] ghost you were entertaining an angel you
[1:07:45] were bringing the angelic spirit of god
[1:07:49] into your life to come and abide with
[1:07:52] you
[1:07:53] what a wonderful thing that is brother
[1:07:56] brother branham would say this let me
[1:07:57] just quote it as it says the day of
[1:08:00] visitation is here you say oh god
[1:08:02] doesn't send angels anymore the holy
[1:08:04] spirit is that angel the holy spirit is
[1:08:08] that person the holy spirit jesus said
[1:08:10] he the holy ghost when he comes he will
[1:08:13] do the works that he did he'd be with us
[1:08:16] even in us and he would bring things to
[1:08:18] our remembrance that he taught and would
[1:08:20] show us things to come the works that i
[1:08:24] do shall he do also now we're living in
[1:08:26] that day we're living in the time
[1:08:30] so we're living in the very time as it
[1:08:33] was in the days of sodom and go we've
[1:08:36] got several classes of people you have
[1:08:38] the sodomites who absolutely go totally
[1:08:41] into sin you have the luddites who is
[1:08:44] the church that goes through the
[1:08:46] tribulation and then you have the bride
[1:08:48] the elect royal abraham
[1:08:51] the called out group that got that sign
[1:08:54] and he recognized it
[1:08:56] now so again it is the
[1:08:59] the dispensation
[1:09:01] of the holy ghost that we are in and it
[1:09:04] is continued on his community it's been
[1:09:06] on and will continue on by the
[1:09:09] administration of angels to the church
[1:09:13] but but they're
[1:09:14] but there are ordained saints of god
[1:09:17] sent from god to carry the thing out
[1:09:21] every man well there's a special calling
[1:09:23] back through the ages uh angels says
[1:09:26] visit man now not a worship of angels
[1:09:29] like brigham brigham
[1:09:31] young did and so on like that uh you
[1:09:34] know joseph smith but a an angel will
[1:09:37] testify to the truth of god
[1:09:40] you see it will declare god it won't
[1:09:43] have some kind of mythical something
[1:09:46] that no one understands
[1:09:48] it'll speak of jesus christ it'll
[1:09:51] testify jesus christ and produce jesus
[1:09:54] christ to the people
[1:09:56] amen so god still has angels and they
[1:09:59] visit the people now again it's angelic
[1:10:03] beings who are the attribute of god and
[1:10:06] they're sent forth to minister to the
[1:10:09] church through the people
[1:10:11] oh my how short we are of the real
[1:10:14] apostolic church today of the blessings
[1:10:17] of god we fall real short
[1:10:20] amen we ought to be a people who
[1:10:23] knows our god who does exploits
[1:10:26] amen the pillar of fire is among
[1:10:29] a man in demonstrating himself and
[1:10:31] showing himself alive and filling with
[1:10:34] the holy ghost
[1:10:35] the bible said in hebrews chapter 1
[1:10:38] verse 14 that are not they all
[1:10:40] ministered spirits sent forth the
[1:10:42] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[1:10:44] salvation
[1:10:46] so they are actually there to minister
[1:10:49] to us
[1:10:50] brother branham would talk about them
[1:10:52] and he would he would pray he said god
[1:10:55] give us an outpouring of the holy spirit
[1:10:58] and he said may the angels of god come
[1:11:00] down into this city and the cities round
[1:11:03] about and throughout the country and
[1:11:06] visit homes and stir people
[1:11:09] amen visit homes and stir people
[1:11:13] don't you want the angels to visit your
[1:11:15] home
[1:11:16] amen don't you want the holy spirit to
[1:11:18] stir your heart
[1:11:20] amen to get you ready to cause your
[1:11:23] faith to advance
[1:11:24] and to get to the point that you realize
[1:11:27] there is nothing too hard for the lord
[1:11:30] amen that he is able to do its seed and
[1:11:32] abundantly above that which you're able
[1:11:34] to think or ask
[1:11:36] you see now god has always used angels
[1:11:39] in his work and there and of course
[1:11:42] there's never been one that is
[1:11:43] worshipped where he wouldn't stand for
[1:11:45] it a true angel doesn't stand to be
[1:11:48] worshiped whether he's an angel in the
[1:11:50] pulpit ministering the word he doesn't
[1:11:52] want worship he's not about kingdom
[1:11:55] building he's not trying to be the next
[1:11:57] great prophet and listen to me and
[1:11:59] follow me and i've got the word and this
[1:12:02] and that but he he's pointing you to
[1:12:04] christ
[1:12:05] get you in love with jesus christ amen
[1:12:08] the lisa the last thing we want around
[1:12:10] here is a bunch of little tim pruitt's
[1:12:13] amen we want sons and daughters of god
[1:12:16] we want them filled with the holy ghost
[1:12:18] we're not trying to reproduce another
[1:12:20] man we are wanting jesus christ
[1:12:23] manifested in human flesh
[1:12:26] that's what we want to see in the church
[1:12:28] [Applause]
[1:12:29] there was a man came to brother branham
[1:12:31] one of the theologians of the day and
[1:12:33] said brother adam you keep talking about
[1:12:34] that angel that visits you that's an
[1:12:36] error
[1:12:37] so in that scenario said god doesn't
[1:12:39] lead the church anymore by angels said
[1:12:42] that daniel and the prophets and them of
[1:12:44] the old testament they had the angels
[1:12:47] but the holy spirit leads the church and
[1:12:49] that's the last day
[1:12:51] he said that's that's true but they're
[1:12:53] still angels but he said that's not
[1:12:55] that's new testament doctrine brother
[1:12:57] branham he said oh sure there is sure it
[1:13:01] is you know to me
[1:13:02] theologian ought to know better than
[1:13:04] this
[1:13:05] but sometimes they get so blinded by
[1:13:08] their creed or their idea or their
[1:13:11] dogmas or their church their church
[1:13:14] theology because it ain't accepted here
[1:13:16] you know then they're blinded by it they
[1:13:19] don't even read the bible when the bible
[1:13:21] is very plain you know there the virgin
[1:13:24] mary was in the in the new testament an
[1:13:26] angel appeared and the man said oh but
[1:13:29] that was before the holy spirit come
[1:13:30] well he said what about philip did he
[1:13:32] had the holy ghost well there the angel
[1:13:35] of the of the lord there appeared to him
[1:13:38] and translated him
[1:13:40] and then and and gave him instructions
[1:13:43] what about saint paul did he have the
[1:13:45] holy ghost well sure he did well then
[1:13:49] what about peter did he have the holy
[1:13:50] ghost well what about peter when he was
[1:13:53] in prison a real angel
[1:13:57] a real angel
[1:13:59] not a mystic figure but something that
[1:14:01] reached down loosed his bonds opened the
[1:14:04] gates
[1:14:05] and then he went and escorted him out of
[1:14:07] prison
[1:14:08] is that right amen paul there after four
[1:14:11] day 18 days
[1:14:13] with no no moon no stars no nothing
[1:14:15] there hopes was gone the storm had taken
[1:14:18] them over and they were about to die and
[1:14:21] they they were hopeless and about that
[1:14:23] time the angel of god dropped down and
[1:14:25] said i was visited tonight by the angel
[1:14:28] of god who stood by me and said there'll
[1:14:31] not be one loss stay with the ship
[1:14:35] amen
[1:14:36] i just want you to know that same angel
[1:14:38] is screaming out to you today don't
[1:14:40] leave the message don't leave the ship
[1:14:43] stay with the good old gospel ship stay
[1:14:46] with the word
[1:14:47] amen because all that stay with the ship
[1:14:51] won't be lost
[1:14:56] hallelujah
[1:14:58] amen what about on the isle of patmos
[1:15:00] with john
[1:15:01] there was angels jesus said i jesus has
[1:15:04] set mine angel to testify these things
[1:15:07] if he was so interested in an angel
[1:15:09] being present to testify to john of the
[1:15:12] initiation of the book of revelation
[1:15:14] what about his fulfillment
[1:15:17] certainly there would be angels
[1:15:19] and let me just say something you
[1:15:20] sisters is not just men god sent an
[1:15:23] angel to hagar
[1:15:24] to the mother of samson to marry the
[1:15:26] mother of jesus
[1:15:28] they meant to women at the tomb of jesus
[1:15:31] announcing the resurrection
[1:15:33] and it's not just a great people
[1:15:36] that angels come not just to the
[1:15:38] educated and the fluent and the rich and
[1:15:41] the ritzy
[1:15:42] but it's to the poor and the humble
[1:15:45] to shepherds on the field the angels
[1:15:47] came
[1:15:48] and when angels came to not just astute
[1:15:52] christian but wayward sinners wayward
[1:15:55] men like jacob

[1:22:15] i said he said in revelation 14 6 i saw
[1:22:18] another angel fly into the midst of
[1:22:21] heaven having everlasting gospel to
[1:22:24] preach unto them that dwell on the earth
[1:22:26] and to every nation intended and tongue

[1:22:31] flying with the everlasting gospel
[1:22:35] anointing men to preach
[1:22:37] i don't mean to indicate that i'm the
[1:22:39] only one
[1:22:41] or that i'm the only one that an angel
[1:22:43] has stood by but no god anytime a man is
[1:22:47] anointed to preach it is with the
[1:22:49] everlasting gospel
[1:22:52] brought by an angel
[1:22:54] by an anointing
[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:22:58] now it is coming

[1:23:30] appeared in this day
[1:23:32] and gave direction
[1:23:34] and leadership
[1:23:36] and we we would see him in in the
[1:23:39] brother branham's ministry as i i've
[1:23:41] said many times people have problems
[1:23:43] with with brother branham and what he
[1:23:45] preached and and the doctrines that he
[1:23:47] brought will blame it on the angel
[1:23:51] the opening of the seven seals we have
[1:23:54] them because
[1:23:55] an angel interrupted his human thoughts
[1:24:01] somebody help me preach now
[1:24:03] amen if you see this is not the message
[1:24:06] of a kentucky preacher
[1:24:08] this is the message of almighty god to
[1:24:11] this last generation a divine gift
[1:24:14] administered by an angel
[1:24:19] you see brother branham saul said that
[1:24:22] he said now anyone knows that the pillar
[1:24:24] of fire that led to children of israel
[1:24:26] was the angel of the covenant is that
[1:24:28] right bible readers which was jesus
[1:24:31] christ
[1:24:32] moses esteemed the reproach of christ
[1:24:34] notice the reproach of christ greater
[1:24:36] than the treasures of egypt
[1:24:39] it was jesus christ he was in a pillar
[1:24:41] of fire that was the same angel that was
[1:24:44] in the bush of burning that same pillar
[1:24:47] of fire and he's been the guiding angel
[1:24:49] through the years
[1:24:51] and i want you to say i wanted to say
[1:24:54] brother branham said when i leave he
[1:24:56] will still be here
[1:25:01] hallelujah i'm glad for that
[1:25:04] but you know
[1:25:06] god does some wonderful things many
[1:25:08] times he he will visit your home
[1:25:12] and he will come right down to your
[1:25:14] place and you want your home to be a
[1:25:17] place that angels are welcome
[1:25:20] where the holy spirit is invited
[1:25:22] where he is the unseen guest at every
[1:25:25] table
[1:25:26] somebody help me preach now
[1:25:28] you remember zacharias and elizabeth
[1:25:31] here god appeared to zechariah to give
[1:25:34] them the promise of john the baptist
[1:25:36] being born human lives but the bible was
[1:25:39] saying they were living up right before
[1:25:42] the lord keeping all the statues and
[1:25:44] commandments of the lord living in
[1:25:46] perfect obedience to the word in the
[1:25:49] light that they had
[1:25:51] so you see they they had a home prepared
[1:25:55] for angelic visitation
[1:25:58] amen the bible the bible tells us this
[1:26:01] that that angels will visit our home oh
[1:26:04] i remember that day
[1:26:07] most profound day
[1:26:09] when the angel visited my home and my
[1:26:12] wife was laying there blind and unable
[1:26:15] to see
[1:26:16] i remember that day when bethany put the
[1:26:19] baby down little drew who had never
[1:26:21] walked crawled and was 18 months old and
[1:26:24] he was sitting there at the end of the
[1:26:25] bed set him down there unable to get up
[1:26:28] on his own and the angel of god came
[1:26:30] down through opened up my wife's eyes
[1:26:33] and healed a little baby true where he
[1:26:35] ran all over the all over the house
[1:26:40] those are the kind of things when angels
[1:26:43] visit a home
[1:26:46] amen brother brad i'm talking about
[1:26:48] visiting a home and wanted they couldn't
[1:26:50] eat her oatmeal her stomach burned the
[1:26:52] other had a growth and that growth
[1:26:54] disappeared because angels visited home
[1:26:56] because somebody didn't give up on a
[1:26:59] promise
[1:27:00] we ought not give up on our promise
[1:27:02] today that we can have him to visit this
[1:27:05] house that he can come by your view that
[1:27:08] he can bring a healing to your life that
[1:27:11] he can deliver you from your sin that
[1:27:13] your evil habits will be controlled by
[1:27:16] the angel of his presence
[1:27:22] the bible said when
[1:27:24] the angels when abraham saw the angels
[1:27:27] appearing
[1:27:28] abraham ran to meet them
[1:27:30] and bowed himself to the ground
[1:27:33] i want to just look at some of these
[1:27:35] thoughts for a little while today on
[1:27:37] entertaining angels
[1:27:39] because they're present
[1:27:43] and they must be welcomed
[1:27:47] amen we must have a place invited
[1:27:51] amen and
[1:27:52] the bible said about abraham he bowed
[1:27:56] himself before the ground which is a
[1:27:58] sign of submission reverence humility of
[1:28:02] recognizing greatness
[1:28:06] he was looking out the tent door
[1:28:09] he was under expectation
[1:28:13] that's what i'm trying to get you to do
[1:28:15] is move from the back to the front
[1:28:20] i don't mean on the front pews i'm
[1:28:22] talking about in your tent
[1:28:25] amen word that you come forward there in
[1:28:28] your experience where that you're not
[1:28:31] back here in a bad mood
[1:28:33] wondering if life is going to be the way
[1:28:36] it is and will we ever get out of this
[1:28:39] cycle of revival and death and will
[1:28:41] there ever be any hope is there any hope
[1:28:44] at all laying back there hopeless but
[1:28:46] getting out sitting there at the door
[1:28:49] and looking
[1:28:51] what's he going to do
[1:28:54] next hallelujah what's he going to do
[1:28:57] next he
[1:28:59] he put healing there for sister atlanta
[1:29:02] he put hair back on the head of sister
[1:29:05] mariah he there made a little baby drew
[1:29:08] to walk and there he puts back a blood
[1:29:11] brain bleed and gave us many more years
[1:29:13] all of these things in it but what's he
[1:29:15] going to do next
[1:29:21] we should never get to the place that
[1:29:23] we're so satisfied that god moved back
[1:29:26] then we should stay in this service in
[1:29:29] this time let it move my way
[1:29:46] praise the lord
[1:29:49] he bowed himself to the ground
[1:29:52] you know sometimes we get questioned
[1:29:55] about the ones that fall down before him
[1:29:57] now in our prayer lines
[1:30:00] that don't happen today
[1:30:02] that ain't message
[1:30:05] is in god that's only the devil for sure
[1:30:08] the devil can do that
[1:30:11] the devil can speak in tongues
[1:30:15] and man the devils can impersonate any
[1:30:18] gift that there is yes
[1:30:21] somebody help me preach now
[1:30:23] amen so yeah there can be impersonations
[1:30:27] but you know this happened in the
[1:30:29] methodist outpouring of sanctification
[1:30:32] happened all the time it was a regular
[1:30:34] occurrence
[1:30:35] in 1946 the angel of god appeared to
[1:30:38] brother branham
[1:30:40] he and sent him out with a gift of
[1:30:42] divine healing and in those meetings he
[1:30:45] found resistance of the angel's message
[1:30:48] of divine healing even among the
[1:30:50] pentecostals
[1:30:51] one assembly of god
[1:30:53] ministered there a pastor in in
[1:30:56] i believe it was in little rock did this
[1:30:58] happen and usually southern people are
[1:31:00] hospitable right
[1:31:02] and kind and and you know we're not
[1:31:04] trying to put ourselves above everybody
[1:31:06] else of the yankees that might be around
[1:31:09] or listening in or other countries but
[1:31:11] southerners are usually hospitable
[1:31:13] people
[1:31:14] you know we we don't call a minister by
[1:31:17] his first name we say brother
[1:31:20] amen we we show respect and honor we we
[1:31:24] we say yes sir and no sir
[1:31:29] even my grandkids expect me to say yes
[1:31:31] sir no sir to them
[1:31:35] but you see you you know they're because
[1:31:37] we train them when they're young you
[1:31:39] know to to show respect yes ma'am no
[1:31:41] ma'am
[1:31:42] respect i think that's good
[1:31:46] amen and so as we as we think of that
[1:31:50] that this man and this pastor in little
[1:31:52] rock when he found out he was asked to
[1:31:55] borrow some folding chairs for the
[1:31:57] meeting they run out of seats and he
[1:31:59] said anybody that believes that divine
[1:32:02] healing stuff and that angel stuff
[1:32:04] listen this was a pentecostal
[1:32:07] and he said anybody believes any of that
[1:32:09] or going to that meeting no they ain't
[1:32:11] going to sit in my chairs
[1:32:14] brother branham says the worst i was
[1:32:16] ever treated
[1:32:18] by an assembly of god preacher
[1:32:21] now that was the move of god at the time
[1:32:26] 1946
[1:32:28] that that's the move that ff bosworth
[1:32:30] came out of that's the move that jack
[1:32:33] cole came up out of that's the move that
[1:32:36] a.a allen came out about that's the move
[1:32:39] that oral roberts came out of
[1:32:42] i'm just trying to show you give you a
[1:32:44] picture
[1:32:45] in those meetings he found resistance
[1:32:48] to the angel's message of divine healing
[1:32:52] you know it kind of made some of the
[1:32:54] pastors mad well
[1:32:56] you know they left my meeting to go
[1:32:58] there
[1:32:59] hear that hillbilly
[1:33:02] that fanatical talking about an
[1:33:06] angel and and so you know they the old
[1:33:10] formal established churches
[1:33:12] you know had got to a place where they
[1:33:15] no longer believed in miracles
[1:33:17] because
[1:33:18] they weren't happening in their churches
[1:33:22] so to excuse themselves being boy to the
[1:33:24] power of god they felt with
[1:33:26] they had superior knowledge of the word
[1:33:29] and they were too advanced for the
[1:33:31] supernatural
[1:33:34] and they thought the supernatural was
[1:33:36] only for an infant church
[1:33:38] one that was in its beginnings it wasn't
[1:33:40] for a mature church those that really
[1:33:43] had the word and
[1:33:45] were perfect and mature didn't need the
[1:33:48] supernatural
[1:33:49] you see if you were really establishing
[1:33:51] the word you were true dignified to
[1:33:54] receive childish things
[1:33:58] now during this
[1:34:00] during his rest between revivals you as
[1:34:03] you know brother branham would have a a
[1:34:06] breakdown from being eight days and
[1:34:07] nights in the prayer line
[1:34:10] giving himself because he promised to
[1:34:11] pray for everybody and the prayer line
[1:34:14] never ended
[1:34:15] because people drove out for miles to
[1:34:17] get people in there in that prayer line
[1:34:21] and during his rest between the two
[1:34:23] revivals brother branham went up to
[1:34:25] british columbia and he was tired and
[1:34:27] weary
[1:34:28] after hours upon hours and the prayer
[1:34:30] lines and spent days away from the
[1:34:32] pressures of the meetings refreshing
[1:34:34] himself
[1:34:36] miles
[1:34:37] miles from civilization civilization he
[1:34:40] was there in the pristine forest of
[1:34:43] british columbia hunting it was there
[1:34:46] that he
[1:34:48] had been
[1:34:49] got out and was on a horse they had
[1:34:51] about 20 22 horses out there and packed
[1:34:53] out other ministers that went along and
[1:34:56] they were thousand miles from a hard top
[1:34:58] road and he got to chasing a grizzly on
[1:35:00] a horse
[1:35:02] not something i would do but apparently
[1:35:04] something he enjoyed doing
[1:35:06] and he said i wanted to get up to see
[1:35:08] what the old fellow looked like i'd want
[1:35:10] to get a better view of him
[1:35:12] and he said i i got turned around back
[1:35:15] there in the mountains kind of lost my
[1:35:17] way and i was way out after dark and the
[1:35:20] moon had come out and i could see kind
[1:35:22] of see but it was cloudy and i saw a
[1:35:24] snowstorm was coming and i found my
[1:35:27] direction on which way to go back and
[1:35:29] because there was no roads or nothing
[1:35:31] for hundreds of miles and it was late
[1:35:34] and he said i as i was traveling through
[1:35:37] he said i come up over an old burnover
[1:35:41] and he said that where the fire had
[1:35:43] burnt down all the wood and everything
[1:35:46] like that those big trees standing split
[1:35:48] all split and sap all burnt out of them
[1:35:51] and everything to bark you standing
[1:35:53] there it was a big stately looking tree
[1:35:56] and i looked there and the first thing i
[1:35:58] know it was the spookiest looking place
[1:36:01] i had ever come to
[1:36:03] and i looked and i thought look at that
[1:36:05] moon shining on them old white trees
[1:36:08] it just looked like my what is that
[1:36:11] looked like a graveyard and a lot of
[1:36:13] tombstones
[1:36:14] so he said it you know it was kind of
[1:36:17] spooky for him and he wanted to ride on
[1:36:19] but something spoke to him and said stay
[1:36:22] here just for a minute and i i but i'm
[1:36:25] hungry argue that i'm i'm starved and
[1:36:27] i'm ready to go and i got miles to go
[1:36:30] you know i got about five mile more
[1:36:32] miles go over another mountain what do
[1:36:34] you want me to stop here for and so but
[1:36:37] i stopped for a minute
[1:36:38] and he said the wind started blowing
[1:36:41] and he said there's a wind come down
[1:36:43] from heaven them trees went
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:36:48] and i said talk about lonesome spooky
[1:36:50] place i said lord what in the world do
[1:36:53] you want me to stop here for
[1:36:55] and and he said that but you wanted me
[1:36:57] to stop here and i i want me to stand
[1:37:00] here for a while maybe i better just
[1:37:01] pray a little while and i got down and
[1:37:04] prayed a little bit and the wind come
[1:37:05] back through and and moved back through
[1:37:07] them old stately um tombstone-looking
[1:37:11] trees that were dead
[1:37:13] and said
[1:37:15] as he
[1:37:15] howled through them
[1:37:17] and i said i thought
[1:37:19] of what joel said now his mind goes to
[1:37:22] the scripture
[1:37:23] and he's placed in this experience with
[1:37:26] the scripture what the palmer worm left
[1:37:28] the caterpillar eating what the
[1:37:29] caterpillar ate the cankerworms ate and
[1:37:32] he said this was once a great forest
[1:37:35] it was green trees
[1:37:37] but there come a great fire and burn all
[1:37:39] the things and now
[1:37:42] just like a big bunch of churches great
[1:37:44] big spires sticking up like that just
[1:37:47] look like a bunch of tombstones a
[1:37:50] thousand
[1:37:51] degrees below zero
[1:37:54] walk in there and say amen
[1:37:57] and they turn around and the pastor get
[1:37:59] a deacon and take him outside the door
[1:38:01] why do you interrupt me when you're
[1:38:03] hollering a man and then brother braden
[1:38:05] said well you interrupt me when you
[1:38:06] don't holler amen
[1:38:09] and he's saying i'm looking around there
[1:38:10] and no spirit in it just as dead as a
[1:38:13] tombstone and he said that's the way it
[1:38:15] is with these big formal churches
[1:38:18] no doubt sure methodist baptist all of
[1:38:21] them big churches one time but now
[1:38:24] what makes that wind make them sound so
[1:38:26] mournful
[1:38:27] and i got to thinking that they'll come
[1:38:30] one day suddenly from heaven like a
[1:38:32] rushing mighty wind and filled all the
[1:38:34] house where they were sitting and i said
[1:38:37] god can send down an old-time
[1:38:40] pentecostal revival and all the churches
[1:38:43] has to do uh do is mourn when it hits
[1:38:46] them they're stiff they're dead they
[1:38:49] can't move they come there's no such
[1:38:51] thing as divine healing oh divine
[1:38:53] healing is gone the days of miracles
[1:38:56] pass oh there's no such thing as gifts
[1:38:58] of the spirit
[1:39:00] just
[1:39:01] pouring the holy ghost out just moving
[1:39:03] through their members say oh don't
[1:39:05] believe that fanaticism
[1:39:08] we are churches
[1:39:10] look here we got ritual we're recorded
[1:39:13] but brother you're dead
[1:39:16] the devil's fire has burned all the bark
[1:39:18] off of you
[1:39:19] you ain't got no lively yet no left yeah
[1:39:22] just a big bunch of ritualistic
[1:39:25] tombstone and the only thing you can do
[1:39:27] is just moan and cry and go on
[1:39:31] remember what they're moaning and crying
[1:39:33] is because they're they're saying days
[1:39:36] of miracles are past there's no more
[1:39:38] healing god doesn't move like he used to
[1:39:42] and and he thought it said i thought
[1:39:43] well lord that's really what it is said
[1:39:46] you know that as the
[1:39:47] the palmer worm left the caterpillar ate
[1:39:50] what caterpillar left and the locust
[1:39:51] state with the lutherans left the method
[1:39:53] is saying and what the method has left
[1:39:55] the baptism satan the baptist left
[1:39:57] nazarene and what
[1:39:59] nazarene left the pentecostal state and
[1:40:01] the whole thing is lead down
[1:40:03] and he said
[1:40:05] you know till the church don't know what
[1:40:07] to believe anymore
[1:40:10] and he said um because what the
[1:40:12] lutherans left what the method has come
[1:40:14] and taken what they had and the baptist
[1:40:16] took what they had now retake what they
[1:40:18] had built from holiness took what they
[1:40:20] had the pentecost had taken what they
[1:40:22] had look at the board tree i said oh god
[1:40:25] what to do now he's realizing what he is
[1:40:28] seeing is exactly what he's been
[1:40:30] experiencing out in this campaign
[1:40:33] he is seeing oh dead morgues of churches
[1:40:38] when the wind is blowing
[1:40:40] and the angel is moving and the holy
[1:40:43] ghost is sweeping through
[1:40:45] they are resisting it
[1:40:49] because the life is gone
[1:40:52] and he said then i saw over in the
[1:40:54] second chapter of joel he said i will
[1:40:57] restore saith the lord
[1:41:00] and i said god what what could you
[1:41:03] restore surely you know these these old
[1:41:06] dead trees won't come back to life
[1:41:08] surely these tombstones won't come back
[1:41:10] to life surely that's not going to be
[1:41:12] that and he said they're just an old
[1:41:14] dead thing an old stump and the moon
[1:41:16] shining on it they're a tombstone dead
[1:41:18] is 12 o'clock midnight the wind comes
[1:41:21] through and
[1:41:22] you know and i thought well you can't
[1:41:24] make that thing move lord because it
[1:41:26] hasn't got any life in it
[1:41:29] so how are you going to restore it he's
[1:41:32] the first thing that won't let you
[1:41:33] preach this kind of gospel in the pulpit
[1:41:37] and he said that's right oh that guy
[1:41:39] he's a holy roller don't want nothing to
[1:41:41] do with him that's right the members
[1:41:43] would bring you in and i'll have to
[1:41:44] consult the board and the deacon and all
[1:41:46] this and and it goes through all that no
[1:41:48] no no right down the road don't tell me
[1:41:50] he said i've been there
[1:41:52] remember this he would face rejection
[1:41:55] over and over and over again
[1:41:58] with the greatest vindication divine
[1:42:00] vindication ever given to the gentile
[1:42:03] ages
[1:42:04] now so he said again he said um um he
[1:42:08] said i thought lord what are you going
[1:42:10] to restore
[1:42:11] and he tied his horse and sat down on
[1:42:13] the log
[1:42:14] and listened to them going
[1:42:17] and he's contemplating well how are you
[1:42:19] ever going to bring revival
[1:42:21] how are you ever going to bring a
[1:42:23] restoration and he said i looked down
[1:42:26] there and i began to hear as the wind
[1:42:29] blowed i began to hear also frolic
[1:42:31] frolic frolic frolic
[1:42:34] and he said i saw some little mini trees
[1:42:37] that was coming up underneath them
[1:42:40] and i said there you are lord i will
[1:42:42] restore saith the lord right in that
[1:42:45] same forest come up and under growth
[1:42:49] what they call backwash today what they
[1:42:51] call fanaticism today and i said look at
[1:42:54] the difference when the wind hits these
[1:42:56] here they say
[1:42:59] but when it hits these little green ones
[1:43:00] they've got life in it it just frolics
[1:43:03] and jumps up and down and oh holy ghost
[1:43:06] old-fashioned holy ghost revival
[1:43:09] i will restore saith the lord
[1:43:13] hallelujah
[1:43:15] amen so you see again he said he said
[1:43:19] god is restoring down here now from this
[1:43:22] undergrowth is coming up a bunch of
[1:43:24] people that's frolic and carrying on
[1:43:27] like the methodist church used to
[1:43:30] you methodists used to have divine
[1:43:32] healings power of god shouting
[1:43:35] well i was burying you students from
[1:43:37] there and he talks about them he said
[1:43:39] when they first come here the methodist
[1:43:40] was called holy rollers that's where you
[1:43:43] got your background and they'd go in
[1:43:45] there and preach the same old gospel i'd
[1:43:47] preach and they'd fall out under the
[1:43:49] island on the floor and lay there all
[1:43:51] night long under the power of the holy
[1:43:53] ghost that get pictures of water and
[1:43:55] throw them in their face and phantom
[1:43:57] with fans if you just let them along
[1:43:59] they'd come through just as sure as the
[1:44:01] world come through in other words to the
[1:44:03] real baptism of the holy ghost
[1:44:05] he said oh god wants to restore the
[1:44:08] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:44:11] saints
[1:44:12] and he even pointed back to there in
[1:44:15] that movie and said god wants that
[1:44:17] restored
[1:44:19] amen he said there
[1:44:21] he said uh you know there
[1:44:23] that same russian wind when they were in
[1:44:26] the upper room come from heaven filled
[1:44:28] all the house where they were sitting
[1:44:29] they said oh i don't know whether to do
[1:44:32] this or not if i go outside they'll make
[1:44:34] fun of me if i say anything what's why
[1:44:36] he said to go out no sir the holy ghost
[1:44:39] met them that little bunch of cowards
[1:44:41] they got life and went down through the
[1:44:44] through the windows and doors and out to
[1:44:46] the streets and acted like a bunch of
[1:44:48] maniacs and staggered and screamed and
[1:44:50] hollered and everything else like a
[1:44:52] bunch of drunken people and left until
[1:44:54] the ritualistic church of that day said
[1:44:57] these men are full of new wine
[1:44:59] he said listen you that are so dignified
[1:45:02] that the
[1:45:03] sowing circle in your church and got
[1:45:05] social standing in louisville new albany
[1:45:07] jeffersonville the blessed virgin mary
[1:45:10] was in there and god almighty required a
[1:45:13] blessed virgin mary and wouldn't let her
[1:45:16] come to heaven until she got that
[1:45:17] experience how are you going to get
[1:45:19] there with anything short of it
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:24] hallelujah well it used to be that way
[1:45:26] when the holy ghost moved upon the
[1:45:28] methodist
[1:45:31] it used to be that way even in the
[1:45:33] pentecostal meetings
[1:45:36] only
[1:45:37] by the way it used to be that way
[1:45:40] on the day of pentecost
[1:45:42] and he used to be that way in brother
[1:45:44] brannon's meetings
[1:45:46] when he met morris reed head who was
[1:45:50] seeking the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:45:52] that had missionaries everywhere and
[1:45:54] realized i need the power of god in my
[1:45:57] life amen he said i laid hands on him
[1:46:00] prayed for him in that room and he fell
[1:46:02] under the power of god and the little
[1:46:04] coffee table there broke the glass out
[1:46:07] of it and he received the baptism of the
[1:46:09] holy ghost and his preaching divine
[1:46:11] healing today on the field
[1:46:14] amen do you know brother branham prayed
[1:46:17] for churches to have that same kind of
[1:46:19] experience
[1:46:20] i wish i could read the whole quote time
[1:46:22] won't let me but here in this part
[1:46:25] he says may in the morning when they
[1:46:27] gather for sunday school class may great
[1:46:30] signs and wonders be accomplished
[1:46:32] may the holy spirit fall in the building
[1:46:34] a revival start slain under the power of
[1:46:37] god laying across the floors everywhere
[1:46:42] let me tell you again it happened in the
[1:46:43] prayer lines
[1:46:47] somebody else's brother brought him a
[1:46:48] question brother branham as i went
[1:46:49] through the prayer line a short time ago
[1:46:52] anointed hands were laid on me and
[1:46:53] prayer was made for my unsaved husband i
[1:46:57] was slain by the power of the lord is
[1:46:59] this a definite sign that he will be
[1:47:01] saved
[1:47:04] so even there they testified in brother
[1:47:07] brethren's prayer lines
[1:47:09] when anointed hands was laid on them
[1:47:11] they were slain by the power of god
[1:47:14] oh yeah so you say
[1:47:16] ah but brother tim i thought this never
[1:47:18] happened in brother branham's meetings
[1:47:21] as far as you know
[1:47:24] in the prayer line this sister was slain
[1:47:26] in the spirit she wanted and she wanted
[1:47:28] to know if that was a sign that her
[1:47:31] husband would be saved
[1:47:33] and brother adam said it was not a sign
[1:47:35] he would be saved but that it was a
[1:47:37] blessing that she received
[1:47:39] and by the way he didn't rebuke it and
[1:47:41] say that only happens when the devil
[1:47:43] comes
[1:47:45] but he said that was something extra god
[1:47:47] gave you it was a sign the holy ghost
[1:47:50] the holy spirit is hearing you he knows
[1:47:52] you he's with you and the holy spirit
[1:47:55] has given you a blessing
[1:47:59] amen well if the holy spirit is giving
[1:48:01] it
[1:48:02] i'll take that blessing anytime
[1:48:07] sure there's fanaticism sure there's
[1:48:09] impersonation sure there's actors
[1:48:13] but there's intellectual actors too
[1:48:18] the appearance of angels is
[1:48:20] investigating angels of judgment
[1:48:22] and jesus is looking for faith
[1:48:29] amen they came to investigate
[1:48:33] they stopped first with abraham
[1:48:36] amen found sarah didn't have faith well
[1:48:38] we got to fix that first
[1:48:41] before we can go on down to sodom and
[1:48:43] send them down there we got to fix the
[1:48:46] faith of abraham get that and sarah the
[1:48:48] church the bride
[1:48:50] jesus is looking for faith
[1:48:53] the angels of ezekiel 9 are looking for
[1:48:56] those who signed crime for abominations
[1:48:58] that done in the city
[1:49:00] so they're looking for people that are
[1:49:03] are contrite in spirit they're humble in
[1:49:05] heart that have a humility about them
[1:49:08] that wants the word of god to have
[1:49:10] preeminence
[1:49:12] is that right amen so again
[1:49:15] again brother branham would talk about
[1:49:17] these that they now some of them they
[1:49:20] can't identify some of them are just
[1:49:21] hoaxes we know that some of them are
[1:49:23] just foolishness but he said you know
[1:49:26] with the rise of all of these mystic
[1:49:27] lights and things going around he said
[1:49:30] he like it was in the days of sodom and
[1:49:32] gomorrah because of his sex affair he
[1:49:36] sent angels down to investigate it
[1:49:39] i wonder if angels aren't investigating
[1:49:42] in america
[1:49:44] who is now
[1:49:46] put into law of same-sex marriages
[1:49:48] i wonder if angels aren't looking there
[1:49:51] and all looking as as young men and well
[1:49:53] young women are addicted to porn
[1:49:57] and every kind of sex sin that is going
[1:49:59] on
[1:50:01] i wonder with the adulteries and the
[1:50:03] fornications and everything else you
[1:50:05] know if angels are not investigating
[1:50:08] that
[1:50:09] amen oh the song says all day all night
[1:50:14] angels are watching over me they're
[1:50:16] watching what you do
[1:50:20] they're looking into man's affairs
[1:50:23] they're looking into this church what
[1:50:25] kind of church is it
[1:50:27] is it a spirit-filled church is it a
[1:50:30] people that are lukewarm is it a people
[1:50:32] that has passion a desire a longing that
[1:50:36] are watching friends appearing what kind
[1:50:39] of people are in that church they're
[1:50:41] investigating walking down seeing who it
[1:50:44] is that they can bring back into faith
[1:50:47] that they can lift up a little higher
[1:50:48] that they can give some guidance to
[1:50:50] their life somebody with me now he said
[1:50:53] he sent down angels to investigate
[1:50:56] angels had come to earth in the last few
[1:50:58] years they've been seen amongst people i
[1:51:01] mean blood i mean honest blood washed
[1:51:04] people who knows it they've even stood
[1:51:06] and had their pictures taken that's
[1:51:07] right angelic beings has visited taken
[1:51:10] word back to the father that sin is
[1:51:13] heaped up to the stars it can hardly
[1:51:16] shine
[1:51:18] amen if you want the honor of an angel
[1:51:21] visiting your home you got to have your
[1:51:23] home ready
[1:51:25] that's what i say about a church
[1:51:28] amen if you want your home church to
[1:51:30] have the honor of an angel of
[1:51:33] we've got to have it ready amen prepared
[1:51:37] and under the blood you can't walk with
[1:51:38] the world and expect god to walk with
[1:51:41] you
[1:51:42] amen we don't want to offend him in our
[1:51:44] dress
[1:51:46] we don't want to offend him in our
[1:51:47] attitudes
[1:51:49] we don't want to offend him in any way
[1:51:51] we want him entertained feel welcome
[1:51:55] somebody with me amen because you cannot
[1:51:57] mix god and the world together they will
[1:52:00] not miss
[1:52:02] god is holy and separated from the world
[1:52:05] and the only thing he'll ever see you is
[1:52:08] when he looks through the blood
[1:52:12] but you see today they take away
[1:52:15] taken the church the commandment the
[1:52:17] teaching the bible explained it away
[1:52:20] therefore
[1:52:22] you make the commandments of god of none
[1:52:24] effect
[1:52:26] there again you take the word of god and
[1:52:28] i'm just quoting this for a minute it
[1:52:30] wasn't so from the beginning take the
[1:52:32] word of god explain it away some sort of
[1:52:34] creed and then you cry where is the god
[1:52:36] of the bible and i just say we need him
[1:52:40] if there was ever a time we needed god
[1:52:42] it's in this age in this time
[1:52:45] amen down through the ages they needed
[1:52:47] him but i'll tell you you are not
[1:52:49] without life this morning
[1:52:51] i need him for myself i need him for my
[1:52:54] life
[1:52:54] i need him for direction for me
[1:52:57] i need him i need his blessings i need
[1:53:00] his healing touch
[1:53:03] i need his anointing
[1:53:06] hallelujah
[1:53:08] amen i stood last sunday here and i
[1:53:10] preached there on a restored tree with
[1:53:12] restored fruits and there i witnessed
[1:53:15] the anointing greater than i want to
[1:53:17] have in months and months and let me
[1:53:20] tell you i feel that same anointing this
[1:53:23] morning
[1:53:24] it's an angelic anointing
[1:53:27] it's the anointing of his presence
[1:53:29] that will break every chain that will
[1:53:32] bring peters out of prison amen that
[1:53:34] will cause men and women to walk
[1:53:36] righteous that will translate the blood
[1:53:38] of jesus christ
[1:53:44] but when you explain him away when you
[1:53:46] say days of miracles have passed no such
[1:53:49] thing as the holy ghost elected on the
[1:53:52] day of pentecost we get it different
[1:53:54] today i don't know what that is but i
[1:53:56] don't want it
[1:53:58] amen i want the same holy ghost at saint
[1:54:01] paul peter james john
[1:54:04] mary that required mary to have the same
[1:54:07] experience i want that same kind of holy
[1:54:10] ghost experience
[1:54:12] amen all but the days of miracles have
[1:54:15] passed no such thing as a holy ghost no
[1:54:17] such thing as divine healer no such
[1:54:19] thing as the visit of angels no such
[1:54:22] thing as miracles
[1:54:23] and when you do that you explain all the
[1:54:25] supernatural away from the bible
[1:54:28] and take god right out of the church
[1:54:31] you see you got to have an attitude of
[1:54:33] believing
[1:54:34] so brother tim why have you been
[1:54:36] preaching the way you have well i'll
[1:54:37] tell you because we got to have an
[1:54:39] attitude of believing
[1:54:41] well we don't want an atmosphere in here
[1:54:44] of the holy ghost and people getting
[1:54:46] saved and all that that's what i heard a
[1:54:48] preacher say that's not me
[1:54:51] i want that kind of atmosphere
[1:54:53] i want that atmosphere where he comes
[1:54:55] down weighs down changes lies cleanses
[1:54:59] from sin sets people on fire invigorates
[1:55:02] them what we're what we want is the
[1:55:06] character of christ what do you think
[1:55:07] the character of christ is
[1:55:09] it is the holy ghost
[1:55:12] it is the power of god and the salvation
[1:55:15] the the holy ghost there cleanses you
[1:55:17] from sin gives you a new nature
[1:55:19] causes you to rise up in christ jesus
[1:55:23] amen you got to have an attitude to
[1:55:26] believe it
[1:55:27] you're going to have to believe in
[1:55:28] angels before they can help
[1:55:30] you god can't work against your unbelief
[1:55:33] that's why he had to change sarah's
[1:55:35] heart
[1:55:36] amen
[1:55:38] sunday a couple of weeks ago i preached
[1:55:40] on under the oak tree
[1:55:44] you know it's too hot sodom the
[1:55:45] atmosphere is heated up
[1:55:47] the smoke is out of hell the stench of
[1:55:50] sin is heavy
[1:55:53] amen but in a moment like that
[1:55:56] there was another atmosphere being
[1:55:58] created
[1:55:59] under an oak tree
[1:56:02] and i believe god has restored an oak
[1:56:04] tree in this day
[1:56:06] oh i don't mean evening like tavern i
[1:56:08] could i i'm not trying to make it you
[1:56:11] know that's for him no more i'm saying
[1:56:13] that oak tree is a pride around the
[1:56:15] world and wherever you are you can
[1:56:18] create an atmosphere
[1:56:23] you don't have to come here to be saved
[1:56:25] you don't have to be here to have
[1:56:26] revival you've got to have got to have
[1:56:29] revival and he's not just here he's
[1:56:32] everywhere he'll meet you there
[1:56:34] sometimes the most inopportune times but
[1:56:37] he'll meet you
[1:56:40] brother branham said you know our
[1:56:42] our revivals have failed and our healing
[1:56:44] campaigns have failed and billy graham
[1:56:46] crossed across the nation and he said
[1:56:49] it's a big ecclesiastical machine
[1:56:52] and god's filled it full of carbon for
[1:56:54] you she's chugged chub pump pump chug
[1:56:56] chug pump pump gasoline run out he
[1:56:58] poured water in it everything's gone
[1:57:01] flat tires on every side
[1:57:03] and then he then he said the
[1:57:04] ecclesiastical machine is stopped
[1:57:09] oh god don't ever let us stop
[1:57:11] progressing
[1:57:13] amen like i've said about this car
[1:57:15] brother branham left us one that would
[1:57:17] drive
[1:57:18] it would drive down the healing to
[1:57:19] miracles to signs to wonders to the real
[1:57:22] holy ghost
[1:57:24] amen it'll take you places come on
[1:57:26] somebody it'll take you in a rapture
[1:57:29] [Applause]
[1:57:31] amen but he's a brother the lid has come
[1:57:33] off of hell
[1:57:34] and streams of demons is pouring from
[1:57:37] everywhere it's conquered the nations it
[1:57:40] conquered politics till it's rotten to
[1:57:42] the core

[1:57:55] day than a pig a hog or a horse or
[1:57:57] something that has nothing to do with it

[1:58:01] again and filled with the holy ghost
[1:58:03] not until that and you're yielded
[1:58:05] completely to the spirit if you're not
[1:58:07] yielded to the spirit then you're not
[1:58:09] born again you don't have the holy
[1:58:11] spirit you might speak in tongues and

[1:58:51] preachers
[1:58:52] methodist baptists and even pentecostals
[1:58:55] and message

[1:58:59] bobbing their hair wearing pants just

[1:59:07] possessed it was legion that tore his
[1:59:09] clothes off of him who is this roaring
[1:59:12] devil
[1:59:15] i just want to say again it's hot
[1:59:18] hell has enlarged its mouth
[1:59:20] sin is encroaching our churches
[1:59:23] holiness
[1:59:25] and holiness is done away with without
[1:59:28] no without which no man shall see the
[1:59:30] lord and is crept in
[1:59:33] young women with skirts that are so
[1:59:35] tight
[1:59:42] i'm not meddling i'm preaching now
[1:59:44] i'm talking about devil streaming loose
[1:59:46] and the hell is hot
[1:59:48] and little one you said and let me quote
[1:59:50] your prophet and you wear little skirts
[1:59:52] that's so tight going down the street so
[1:59:55] tight till the skin's on the outside and
[1:59:57] call yourself holiness women is that the
[1:59:59] way a daughter of god would act
[2:00:04] you know clothes above the knees
[2:00:07] topped off with painted nails
[2:00:12] are you with me now
[2:00:14] amen you look like a bunch of perverted
[2:00:16] frenchmen with maybe bean holes on your
[2:00:19] hands and fingers and nails come on
[2:00:23] we used to believe in holiness
[2:00:26] we used to believe in righteousness
[2:00:29] shouldn't we still
[2:00:31] amen he said look at the modern wounded
[2:00:33] one today little skinned down dressed in
[2:00:36] every form she can't move without
[2:00:38] sinning walking tripping down the street
[2:00:40] with all the makeup and cosmetics a max
[2:00:43] factor can put on her nearly fixing her
[2:00:45] hair like some little girl wear a skirt
[2:00:48] just up above her about above her knees
[2:00:50] if she's got on any at all but you look
[2:00:52] at her she's pretty satan knows how to
[2:00:54] do it he's the author of beauty that
[2:00:57] type of beauty which results in sin
[2:01:01] beauty that results in sin
[2:01:04] and i see
[2:01:06] i see as the lid comes off the kettle
[2:01:09] i see a new style raisin up out of hell
[2:01:13] of these leggings
[2:01:18] the worldly women found they can wear
[2:01:21] them and show every form of their body
[2:01:26] they leave nothing to your imagination
[2:01:27] it's all their skin tight
[2:01:30] ever crack every crevice
[2:01:33] hey mountain
[2:01:34] and those you know who do try to be a
[2:01:37] little
[2:01:37] more modest they wear t-shirts just to
[2:01:40] kind of to cover their bottom
[2:01:43] but you see
[2:01:44] that's one thing for the world to do
[2:01:46] that
[2:01:48] but now he's coming in with our girls
[2:01:50] with a skirt that barely covers the knee
[2:01:54] if at all and they sit and expose their
[2:01:56] thigh or their crotch and they think
[2:01:58] they're covered because they got
[2:02:00] leggings on
[2:02:02] no they're not covered
[2:02:04] and for people that are expecting a
[2:02:06] unappearing how can we when the angels
[2:02:10] don't visit places where holiness
[2:02:13] modesty and righteousness does not
[2:02:15] abound
[2:02:19] and while i'm at it you know brother
[2:02:21] brethren said you sisters you know sure
[2:02:22] if you want to wear a little necklace
[2:02:24] your husband gave you something special
[2:02:26] like that you don't want to wear it
[2:02:27] that's fine that's great but don't look
[2:02:29] like you like you walk down to a dime
[2:02:32] store with the magnet on
[2:02:34] and now you know there's one around this
[2:02:36] ankle and one around that toe and one
[2:02:38] around
[2:02:42] the prophet of god gave you some leeway
[2:02:44] where you could wear a nice little
[2:02:46] necklace but you see the devil don't
[2:02:48] want to stay that way
[2:02:50] [Applause]
[2:02:52] any woman that dresses that way ain't
[2:02:55] looking for his appearance
[2:02:57] they're looking for men
[2:02:58] and their approval rather than god's
[2:03:01] approval
[2:03:02] [Music]
[2:03:04] amen like it or lump it that's the way i
[2:03:06] preach it here
[2:03:08] amen line up or leave
[2:03:10] you don't matter to me
[2:03:12] i never preached for money i never
[2:03:14] preached for popularity we want to
[2:03:16] preach we want a place where the spirit
[2:03:18] of god can abide
[2:03:20] amen women look holy we're men are
[2:03:23] righteous
[2:03:29] why do you think all this tatted up
[2:03:31] business is going on it's because the
[2:03:32] mark of the beast is happening
[2:03:34] they're marking their beast
[2:03:43] but look at it
[2:03:45] leggings
[2:03:46] young girls wearing them
[2:03:48] barely cover their knees got leggings
[2:03:50] down to their ankles
[2:03:52] sit over there in a chair expose all the
[2:03:54] way up to their crotch and crotch and
[2:03:57] you know all the you know all their
[2:03:59] thigh all their legs everything else and
[2:04:01] they think they're covered
[2:04:03] you're not
[2:04:04] you can't move without sinning
[2:04:13] in verse two
[2:04:15] i know you want me to get off of that
[2:04:17] all right so let's just go a little
[2:04:18] further
[2:04:20] in verse two the bible said he ran to
[2:04:23] meet him
[2:04:24] abraham ran i want you to look at the
[2:04:27] passion
[2:04:29] and that's one thing we must never do is
[2:04:32] lose our passion
[2:04:34] for the truth for righteousness for
[2:04:37] holiness for the word of god for the
[2:04:39] spirit of god
[2:04:43] you see
[2:04:46] abraham knew as he passed by he must be
[2:04:49] persuaded to stop
[2:04:54] it ain't enough to see him
[2:04:57] he got to stop him
[2:04:59] it ain't enough to see him passing by
[2:05:02] he got to stop here
[2:05:04] let me detain him let me constrain him
[2:05:08] let me say i want to entertain you stay
[2:05:11] a little while
[2:05:13] don't be so quick to walk on by come on
[2:05:16] in
[2:05:18] i want to talk it over with you
[2:05:23] oh hallelujah
[2:05:24] is there somebody here today say i want
[2:05:26] to talk it over with him
[2:05:28] a man he must be persuaded
[2:05:31] brother branham talks about young men he
[2:05:33] said we'll give their lives for their
[2:05:35] country
[2:05:36] you know and fight their battles they
[2:05:38] can be great men of courage and it used
[2:05:40] to be that way they'd join the army they
[2:05:42] didn't care if it was america you know
[2:05:45] if it was vietnam they didn't understand
[2:05:47] what was going on i'm american if it's
[2:05:49] american doing it we're gonna go out and
[2:05:51] we're gonna defeat their enemy they'd go
[2:05:52] out and they'd take their train and
[2:05:54] stick their head up like a hero and get
[2:05:56] it blowed off
[2:05:57] they didn't care they would give their
[2:05:59] lives for the country
[2:06:01] and he goes on he said but a man sell
[2:06:03] them will you ever find one that'll lay
[2:06:05] down his life for the cause of christ he
[2:06:07] won't even crawl out of his shade tree
[2:06:09] to go to church
[2:06:12] and he won't even get out from behind
[2:06:14] the television long enough to attend a
[2:06:16] wednesday night prayer meeting
[2:06:19] it's a shame it's a disgrace
[2:06:23] that's the reason angels don't visit the
[2:06:25] churches
[2:06:28] that's the reason angels don't visit
[2:06:30] homes
[2:06:31] we got to get down to deep sincerity of
[2:06:34] the thing the angels of god are here on
[2:06:36] earth tonight just the same as they have
[2:06:38] always been the holy ghost has been here
[2:06:40] ever since the resurrection of jesus
[2:06:42] they're coming forth of pentecost and
[2:06:44] he's appeared through the all the ages
[2:06:46] down down
[2:06:48] getting a remnant of people together the
[2:06:50] rest of it is cannon fodder i just tell
[2:06:54] you that's it now is fodder that mix
[2:06:57] with smoke out of torment yes sir it'll
[2:07:00] take a born-again experience washed in
[2:07:02] the blood of the lamb sanctified filled
[2:07:05] with the holy ghost or they'll never
[2:07:07] make that rapture
[2:07:10] that's according to the word
[2:07:12] verse 3 he said now look my lord
[2:07:15] if i've now found favor in thy sight
[2:07:18] that's what we want we want to find
[2:07:20] grace
[2:07:22] let me find favor it would be a favor
[2:07:26] amen it would be it would be
[2:07:29] an honor
[2:07:30] to have you come visit our service
[2:07:33] for you come drop down for a little
[2:07:34] while and let us just entertain you for
[2:07:36] a while
[2:07:38] oh don't pass from my from that servant
[2:07:40] i pray you let let a little water and
[2:07:42] pray you be fetched and wash your feet
[2:07:45] and rest under the tree
[2:07:48] let a little water be fetched
[2:07:51] let's watch those feet
[2:07:53] that's been walking through that hot
[2:07:55] sand
[2:07:57] let me wash the feet of jehovah
[2:07:59] let me have a servant's heart
[2:08:02] a servant's attitude
[2:08:05] let me provide a welcoming atmosphere
[2:08:09] that welcomes the presence of the
[2:08:11] almighty
[2:08:13] like rebecca
[2:08:15] when she was there you know and she
[2:08:17] looked up and she saw the camel train
[2:08:19] coming of eliezer
[2:08:21] she didn't know that strange man
[2:08:23] she didn't know she did not know that
[2:08:26] that camel said so that she saw coming
[2:08:29] was the one she's gonna ride on to meet
[2:08:31] her new bridegroom and go to her new
[2:08:32] home
[2:08:33] she didn't know that but there there
[2:08:35] again there was something something
[2:08:37] there when she saw him there was
[2:08:39] something that she was hospitable
[2:08:42] she was welcoming
[2:08:45] you and she said let me give you some
[2:08:47] water
[2:08:48] and i'll water your camels also
[2:08:52] well you know that was about that was
[2:08:54] about 10 camels the bible said
[2:08:58] and 10 camels each one can drink 30
[2:09:01] gallons
[2:09:03] and they'd been a couple of weeks across
[2:09:05] the desert they were thirsty
[2:09:07] and so it would take 300 gallons of
[2:09:11] water
[2:09:14] 300 gallons of water to water those tin
[2:09:17] camels
[2:09:19] and there she would have to walk down a
[2:09:21] few stairs and bend over to fill her jar
[2:09:24] lift that heavy jar of there about five
[2:09:27] gallons and she'd do that 60 times
[2:09:33] um
[2:09:34] i don't know how many people would would
[2:09:37] entertain strangers like that
[2:09:40] but here she was entertaining an angel
[2:09:42] unawares
[2:09:44] because the angel lord he said the angel
[2:09:46] of god will go before you
[2:09:49] and eleazar was only just the face
[2:09:53] are you with me
[2:09:55] she was ready to do the heavy lifting
[2:09:57] she had the heart of a servant you see
[2:09:59] she's typing the bride whatever it takes
[2:10:04] i don't have to understand it all i just
[2:10:06] know i just know that there's something
[2:10:09] about that man something strange there
[2:10:12] he says and i'm going to be careful to
[2:10:14] entertain this angel
[2:10:17] entertain this stranger because in doing
[2:10:19] so we'll entertain the angels unaware
[2:10:22] brother branham said that eleazar had
[2:10:25] prayed and i think the bible tells you
[2:10:26] to say that eliezer prayed and said lord
[2:10:29] direct your servant you know there may
[2:10:31] it be the one that offers to water and
[2:10:34] give me water and my camel's water may
[2:10:36] it be the one he prayed the prayer
[2:10:39] he knew what it would take in order to
[2:10:41] get back
[2:10:43] somebody helped me preach
[2:10:44] in order to get back home the camels had
[2:10:46] to be watered
[2:10:49] amen and he said he prayed and he said
[2:10:52] brother madam said i believe the angel
[2:10:55] of the lord
[2:10:56] he he beat him to rebecca a half an hour
[2:11:02] and he moved on her heart and spoke to
[2:11:04] her and said get to the water
[2:11:06] amen
[2:11:08] hallelujah and rebecca came to the water
[2:11:11] of life at the evening time oh
[2:11:14] hallelujah for at the evening time
[2:11:17] it shall be light
[2:11:20] hallelujah oh now light was coming up on
[2:11:23] her purpose and her calling
[2:11:27] hallelujah amen it's a time that the
[2:11:30] angel lord in the supernatural is
[2:11:32] revealing himself to rebecca's today
[2:11:34] amen to the bride of isaac
[2:11:37] somehow another she was moved to go to
[2:11:39] the waters
[2:11:41] oh hallelujah
[2:11:43] he said the angel of the lord in the
[2:11:45] message goes and wounds rebecca to come
[2:11:48] to the waters of life
[2:11:50] you wonder what attracted you to this
[2:11:52] message
[2:11:55] it was the angel of god seeking you out
[2:11:58] come on now
[2:12:00] seeking you out he found you there may
[2:12:03] you was in a strange land maybe you were
[2:12:05] there in a baptist methodist
[2:12:07] presbyterian catholic home but he found
[2:12:09] you
[2:12:11] and one thing i like about him he don't
[2:12:14] leave you where he found you
[2:12:16] oh hallelujah he was about to elevate
[2:12:20] her a man from a lonely position to a
[2:12:23] mother in israel
[2:12:25] hallelujah
[2:12:27] to be the wife to isaac
[2:12:30] amen
[2:12:32] eliezer started praying let that angel
[2:12:34] go before me
[2:12:36] and i'll tell you here come rebecca
[2:12:38] right there to meet him
[2:12:40] you see no more than your heart goes to
[2:12:42] hunger than thirsting for god some kind
[2:12:44] of holy ghost revival will break out
[2:12:49] i mean some people want to just chalk it
[2:12:51] up brother tim is you trying to stir
[2:12:53] everybody up all the time you're just
[2:12:55] stirring them up you know you're just
[2:12:56] whipping up a crowd no no no you don't
[2:12:58] get the picture

[2:13:15] it's time that we are loaded on those
[2:13:17] camels and going home
[2:13:21] hallelujah
[2:13:22] he said i think of the beautiful rebecca
[2:13:24] that evening watering the camel's
[2:13:26] watering the very thing that was going
[2:13:28] to take her to her bridegroom and that's
[2:13:30] what it is water and the camel
[2:13:32] represents power and the church of the
[2:13:35] living god today is rejoicing and
[2:13:37] watering the power of the holy ghost in
[2:13:39] a packer someday and take her yonder to
[2:13:41] meet her isaac in the air
[2:13:43] hallelujah
[2:13:45] amen and he said what is watering
[2:13:48] the very power that we are watering now
[2:13:50] with praises
[2:13:53] see that's why i try to get you to do it
[2:13:55] all the way from the front view to the
[2:13:57] mezzanine because the very power will
[2:14:00] water now with praises with thanksgiving
[2:14:02] and glory and power and might is this
[2:14:04] very holy spirit that attack us to jesus
[2:14:08] someday
[2:14:11] hallelujah
[2:14:12] again he said unlike rebecca watered the
[2:14:15] camel the very camel she watered she
[2:14:17] wrote unto me to bridegroom that very
[2:14:19] god we preach about the very word which
[2:14:21] is god the very god that's in the word
[2:14:24] will rise us up someday by the baptism
[2:14:27] of the holy ghost and our critics will
[2:14:29] be killed by the same power that raises
[2:14:31] you to glory oh my rise up and ride on
[2:14:34] it you people that are sick

[2:14:40] are you sick of sin are you sick of the
[2:14:42] evil age are you sick of all the hell
[2:14:45] around us are you sick of all of it then
[2:14:48] rise up and ride on it and give praise
[2:14:52] to the holy spirit
[2:15:01] like the woman who washed
[2:15:03] jesus feet
[2:15:05] he saw her chance when she saw he had a
[2:15:09] need
[2:15:11] we're all times worried about our need
[2:15:14] word about our feelings
[2:15:16] well he preached he hurt my feelings
[2:15:19] i'm not worried about your feelings
[2:15:23] any man baptist churches where they
[2:15:25] worry about feelings
[2:15:28] methodist church they're worried about
[2:15:30] feelings can't say nothing about gays
[2:15:32] because it'll hurt somebody's feelings
[2:15:34] can't say nothing about the evil and
[2:15:36] it'll hurt somebody's feelings i'm not
[2:15:38] worried about your feelings
[2:15:41] i'm worried about his feelings
[2:15:45] is somebody with me
[2:15:46] amen but we get worried about our need
[2:15:48] what about his need god is an object of
[2:15:51] worship
[2:15:52] and so he has a need to be worshiped he
[2:15:54] created angels to worship him he created
[2:15:57] you to worship him
[2:15:58] abraham bowed his head to the ground and
[2:16:00] said let me wash your feet
[2:16:03] let me get some water
[2:16:05] let me wash the dirt off of you
[2:16:08] you've been walking through the hot
[2:16:10] sands

[2:16:57] tent door
[2:16:59] listen sarah you are going to make
[2:17:01] unleavened bread
[2:17:03] abraham
[2:17:05] it's too hot to cook
[2:17:08] come on come on now
[2:17:11] it's too evil of these to have a fire
[2:17:16] it's impossible to have a pillar of fire
[2:17:19] in our church
[2:17:23] are you with me hey man it's true let me
[2:17:26] let me tell you friends it's got to have
[2:17:28] fire even for the passover to cook the
[2:17:30] lamb to cook the unleavened bread and
[2:17:33] man it can't be a half cooked meal it's
[2:17:36] got to be fully done
[2:17:40] oh it's too hot too hot to make
[2:17:42] unleavened bread
[2:17:44] well
[2:17:46] but they can't sarah you know better
[2:17:48] than that
[2:17:50] you can't offer any leaven
[2:17:53] in bread offered to angels
[2:17:58] it must be unleavened bread
[2:18:01] of sincerity and truth
[2:18:04] and in order to bind to serpent death
[2:18:06] and have our chains and have our son
[2:18:10] amen
[2:18:11] we're going to have to bind the serpent
[2:18:12] death
[2:18:14] and the only way to do that is to come
[2:18:16] with the unleavened bread of sincerity
[2:18:18] and truth
[2:18:21] let me just tell you like many of you
[2:18:25] today my whole life since a young boy
[2:18:28] has been a feast to the lord abraham was
[2:18:30] making a feast
[2:18:32] that's what your life is to be
[2:18:35] your life is to be a feast to god
[2:18:39] and and you know a call to the feast to
[2:18:42] feast is a fast with the lord you see
[2:18:44] it's unleavened bread and since i've
[2:18:47] been feasting i've been fasting putting
[2:18:49] away ungodliness as a boy i even put
[2:18:52] away my education
[2:18:54] i did
[2:18:57] you know why i thought about it you know
[2:18:59] when when i quit school at in the 10th
[2:19:01] grade and and there you know even in my
[2:19:04] last year i got a double study hall i
[2:19:06] took spoken word books
[2:19:09] and i read spoken word books to the
[2:19:11] study hall
[2:19:12] underlined them
[2:19:14] so i could preach
[2:19:15] as a 15 and 16 year old boy preacher
[2:19:18] and have something to preach on
[2:19:21] because i wanted the people fed the word
[2:19:24] of god
[2:19:26] amen so you see
[2:19:28] you know i i could devote myself to the
[2:19:31] ministry and entertain elohim
[2:19:35] amen you know sometimes you think it's
[2:19:38] impossible when we ask you take it fast
[2:19:41] from facebook
[2:19:43] take them fast from twitter and
[2:19:45] instagram and take a fast from the news
[2:19:49] come on the holy ghost does not feed on
[2:19:52] news that's not what he relishes
[2:19:55] he wants your best
[2:19:58] take a cab young and
[2:20:00] tender amen
[2:20:02] don't get the crippled one that now now
[2:20:05] listen boys you know these strangers
[2:20:06] have come up you know
[2:20:12] just to hide the identity i'm going to
[2:20:14] tell you about a home that i knew about
[2:20:18] the mother had made a
[2:20:22] a dish of goulash
[2:20:26] that's all i know to call it goulash
[2:20:28] something
[2:20:30] and and they they had made that and
[2:20:33] and and there they
[2:20:36] you know the family they ate it
[2:20:39] and then the cat got in it
[2:20:42] ate some too
[2:20:44] then all of a sudden
[2:20:46] company comes
[2:20:50] so the kids mom and dad's out of the
[2:20:52] home mom they don't know about it so the
[2:20:54] kids quickly warm up the goulash
[2:20:57] that the cat's been eaten in
[2:21:00] sometimes that's the way we do
[2:21:04] you know we we just kind of get a little
[2:21:06] warm up about something
[2:21:09] not giving our best
[2:21:11] we come to a service sometimes on
[2:21:13] wednesday night we well actually you can
[2:21:15] have some real goods wins tonight a lot
[2:21:17] of times you know it's sunday you want
[2:21:19] to drag
[2:21:21] you know i worked all week brother tim
[2:21:23] give your best
[2:21:27] amen you see he doesn't feed on creeds
[2:21:29] and dogmas
[2:21:31] amen the serpent has got to be bound so
[2:21:34] you know the serpent
[2:21:36] is hot on people's trails and to find
[2:21:38] him you've got to be more sincere and
[2:21:41] here abraham ran it shows his eagerness
[2:21:44] to entertain and he's restrained them
[2:21:48] luke 24 13 tells about two that
[2:21:52] after jesus had risen went to a village
[2:21:55] called emmaus verse 28
[2:21:57] and they drew near the village where
[2:21:59] they whether they went and he made as
[2:22:01] though he would have went further
[2:22:05] but they constrained him and said abide
[2:22:07] with us
[2:22:08] you see jesus the resurrected one had
[2:22:11] been walking with him all day and
[2:22:13] and saying should not christ have
[2:22:15] suffered these things and going over the
[2:22:17] scriptures and showing
[2:22:19] how the christ would be and it comes
[2:22:21] down to evening time
[2:22:23] and when it comes down the evening time
[2:22:26] you know they they're going to turn in
[2:22:28] and then
[2:22:29] and he says they say come in
[2:22:32] abide with us and the bible says he made
[2:22:34] his though he would have went further
[2:22:37] that's the way he will do a lot of times
[2:22:39] in his service he'll make like he's just
[2:22:42] going to bless somebody else
[2:22:44] but if you will constrain him
[2:22:47] you can get him to come near your pew
[2:22:50] you can get him to speak to your heart
[2:22:54] amen but it's going to take somebody to
[2:22:56] beg him
[2:22:58] that constrains him now you must come in
[2:23:01] no don't pass me by past me not o gentle
[2:23:05] savior hear my humble cry well on others
[2:23:08] you're calling don't pass me by.
[2:23:12] amen
[2:23:14] he wants to see your emotions
[2:23:16] he wants to know how much you believe in
[2:23:18] him
[2:23:19] how bad you want it
[2:23:21] amen
[2:23:23] amen oh brother we got to be that kind
[2:23:26] of begging people brother brandon said
[2:23:28] amen people that signed cried for the
[2:23:30] abomination the old mourner's back
[2:23:33] in the church
[2:23:35] amen where instead of being taken out
[2:23:38] that there's weeping and crying at the
[2:23:40] altar and i believe i believe in every
[2:23:43] bit of this shouting and jumping and
[2:23:45] running but i think it ought to be
[2:23:48] for ran by real mourning and dying out
[2:23:53] and crying and weeping your way to
[2:23:56] calvary and sorry for your sins for you
[2:23:59] jump up and run and shout
[2:24:03] amen
[2:24:06] you know
[2:24:07] it's not the emotion we're interested in
[2:24:10] it's him we're interested in
[2:24:13] abide with me
[2:24:15] oh you said but i couldn't ask him to
[2:24:17] come in i've been kind of a gambler i
[2:24:20] don't care what you've been he'll come
[2:24:21] your way
[2:24:23] so i've been sweethearted don't matter
[2:24:25] what you've been
[2:24:26] god's trying to work his way into your
[2:24:28] heart
[2:24:29] amen somebody's got to be crying even
[2:24:31] this cry even so kind lord jesus
[2:24:36] amen that's got to be our hearts cry
[2:24:39] amen i drove through mending this word
[2:24:42] this day and seeing the signs elect this
[2:24:44] and that one to the other and knowing
[2:24:46] that there could catastrophes being come
[2:24:48] here and then the city government turned
[2:24:51] around and bring every kind of evil into
[2:24:54] the city and i'm thinking oh god you
[2:24:57] know what it's going to be and how it's
[2:24:59] going to be
[2:25:00] how will it happen and i just begin to
[2:25:02] say lord
[2:25:03] whatever that it takes
[2:25:05] for our will to break
[2:25:07] whatever it takes for us to be crying
[2:25:09] even so come lord jesus no matter what
[2:25:12] the elect in the senate where they turn
[2:25:14] it back to republicans or turn it back
[2:25:16] the presidency back to a republican
[2:25:18] everyday say well we'll have a few more
[2:25:20] good years let me tell you friends we
[2:25:23] got to get to the point that we say i'm
[2:25:25] sick of this world i'm sick of sin i'm
[2:25:28] sick of the evil even so i've learned
[2:25:32] jesus that heaven becomes more appealing
[2:25:35] than staying here
[2:25:42] do you remember this woman
[2:25:45] matthew 26 16.
[2:25:50] matthew 26 16 13.
[2:25:56] verily i say unto you
[2:25:59] where
[2:26:00] so ever this gospel shall be preached
[2:26:04] in the whole world let me stop right
[2:26:05] there this gospel has not been preached
[2:26:10] since the first stage of the day of
[2:26:11] pentecost
[2:26:13] there was a falling away
[2:26:15] we come and we have it restored
[2:26:17] the gospel is now being preached
[2:26:22] wherever this gospel shall be preached
[2:26:25] in the whole world
[2:26:26] there shall also do this
[2:26:30] all there shall also this
[2:26:32] that this woman had done
[2:26:35] be told
[2:26:36] as a memorial of her
[2:26:40] so when the gospel is preached
[2:26:43] in the last day
[2:26:46] this woman who washed jesus feet
[2:26:49] in simon's house
[2:26:51] and entertained christ
[2:26:56] that that's going to be one of the
[2:26:58] themes
[2:27:00] of the last day message
[2:27:05] oh
[2:27:06] yes
[2:27:08] and he did
[2:27:09] and when the seventh angel began to
[2:27:11] restore the message back to the gospel
[2:27:13] again this story reminded us again that
[2:27:17] we are in the appearing of christ
[2:27:21] and while he is here he must be invited
[2:27:27] and welcomed
[2:27:30] and given service
[2:27:36] just as it is this day so it was or that
[2:27:39] day so is it in this day
[2:27:41] they wanted brother branham to draw a
[2:27:43] crowd
[2:27:44] they wanted for entertainment
[2:27:47] but they would leave jesus
[2:27:49] in the corner
[2:27:50] neglected
[2:27:54] brother branham preached the sermon all
[2:27:56] over and over again he started out with
[2:27:58] a message called pride
[2:28:01] and that was the first time he preaches
[2:28:03] on jesus with dirty feet
[2:28:06] then he preaches that title that jesus
[2:28:08] with dirty feet the unwelcome christ
[2:28:10] three times he would even preach that
[2:28:13] over in europe
[2:28:15] because it's not just america that he's
[2:28:17] unwelcomed in
[2:28:19] it's the whole world he's unwelcomed in
[2:28:22] he would preach again
[2:28:24] twice at least the worst center in the
[2:28:26] city
[2:28:28] washing jesus feet
[2:28:30] one of the meanest man in town he'd
[2:28:32] entitle it twice
[2:28:34] the meanest man i know
[2:28:36] the meanest man in santa
[2:28:38] maria and then
[2:28:41] the last time he would preach it would
[2:28:42] be
[2:28:43] jesus keeps all of his appointments
[2:28:48] he will show up
[2:28:50] even when he knows he will not be
[2:28:53] he will he is rejected even now
[2:28:56] today among many churches that call
[2:28:59] himself message
[2:29:02] the worst center in the city
[2:29:05] was not the prostitute
[2:29:09] and the meanest person was not the
[2:29:12] prostitute
[2:29:13] the worst sinner in the city
[2:29:17] and the meanest man i know are those who
[2:29:20] invite jesus
[2:29:21] and leave him there with dirty feet
[2:29:26] and i want you to say to you this is
[2:29:28] more than a story
[2:29:31] because jesus said this story or this
[2:29:35] this will be told as a memorial
[2:29:37] what this woman has done
[2:29:41] it'll be an end time sign
[2:29:44] of what will happen in the last days
[2:29:48] that christ will not be
[2:29:50] welcomed down
[2:29:54] or you say well brother tim
[2:29:56] um all that was just pre-seals and we
[2:29:58] have advanced higher than that no it
[2:30:00] wasn't he was still declaring that in
[2:30:02] the sermon in 1964
[2:30:05] saying jesus will keep all his
[2:30:07] appointments
[2:30:08] he's got an appointment for this age
[2:30:10] he's showing up in this church he's
[2:30:12] showing up around the world there's
[2:30:14] investigating angels of judgment
[2:30:17] and they're looking
[2:30:19] for entertainment
[2:30:20] somebody to welcome them
[2:30:23] jesus had been invited but it wasn't for
[2:30:25] the right reason
[2:30:27] simon the pharisee just wanted him to
[2:30:29] show off to use him to draw a crowd and
[2:30:31] to make fun of him
[2:30:34] to find out his faults and his flaws and
[2:30:36] be able to pick at something
[2:30:39] you see the brother brandon said you see
[2:30:41] anybody like that hates you your calls
[2:30:44] for christ and bring you in it's either
[2:30:46] to get you a lot of money off of you or
[2:30:48] do something or use in some way they
[2:30:51] they won't believe the message they got
[2:30:52] you there for something else
[2:30:55] i think about brother branham being
[2:30:56] invited to places and showing up and and
[2:30:59] it flashes where william brown and will
[2:31:01] be here praying for the sick and they'll
[2:31:04] show up and they wouldn't let him out on
[2:31:06] the stage and say
[2:31:07] uh william branham i had some sickness
[2:31:10] in his home and had to go back home he's
[2:31:11] not here but we got programming
[2:31:16] that's what he saw that when and there
[2:31:19] in the third pull of his ministry and he
[2:31:22] has the tent vision and he sees that the
[2:31:25] thing you know the crowd is there and
[2:31:27] they're gathered and said somebody just
[2:31:29] missed the crowd
[2:31:31] and and he complained why did you why
[2:31:33] was the crowd just missed in the vision
[2:31:36] he said oh we've done take off we've
[2:31:38] already taken up the offering
[2:31:41] you see it became about money it became
[2:31:43] about building ministries
[2:31:47] and i just want to say message brothers
[2:31:49] and message pastors it's not about
[2:31:51] building your ministry
[2:31:53] it's not about
[2:31:54] money it's not about who has to find his
[2:31:57] church and oh how many listens to me on
[2:32:00] the internet
[2:32:02] you see it's not about that it's about
[2:32:04] christ
[2:32:07] and welcoming
[2:32:08] him and recognizing his messiahship
[2:32:13] and when jesus arrived they didn't wash
[2:32:15] his feet
[2:32:17] now that was a custom in that day when
[2:32:19] and it must have been a testament and um
[2:32:22] abraham's day and apparently jesus wants
[2:32:25] us to have that custom in our day
[2:32:29] you see the custom was when you arrived
[2:32:32] to wash your feet
[2:32:35] you're dirty from walking the paths and
[2:32:36] the roads where animals walked and
[2:32:38] dropped their dung along the road
[2:32:41] the long robot of the galileans would
[2:32:44] would have picked up the stink and the
[2:32:46] smell
[2:32:48] you'd be embarrassed to walk on this
[2:32:50] expensive persian
[2:32:52] rugs and sweaty from the journey with
[2:32:54] dirty feet and grime between your toes
[2:32:59] but that's what god did in abraham's day
[2:33:02] when he changed his mask
[2:33:04] and his fullness came in jesus
[2:33:08] god took on the stink of humanity
[2:33:11] to come and dwell with mortals
[2:33:16] now the lowest poorest paid man got the
[2:33:19] job to wash the feet
[2:33:21] and when i think about this when jesus
[2:33:24] showed us of his greatness he didn't do
[2:33:27] it with a struck out chest with degrees
[2:33:29] but he put aside his garments took a
[2:33:32] towel and girded himself
[2:33:34] and washed his disciples feet
[2:33:37] he took the lowest place
[2:33:40] to wash the dung and the dirt off of
[2:33:42] their feet
[2:33:44] so you see they would they would draw up
[2:33:47] a
[2:33:48] big basin of water
[2:33:50] you know and then you know they would
[2:33:52] take and
[2:33:54] maybe
[2:33:55] kneel down and
[2:33:56] watch the feet
[2:33:58] wash all the dirt and the dung and the
[2:34:00] dust and the stuff off your body
[2:34:03] take a towel wash them and take your
[2:34:05] sandals and set them up on a little
[2:34:07] mantel there
[2:34:08] at the entrance of the door
[2:34:10] and and then get a
[2:34:12] another
[2:34:13] another
[2:34:14] pair of fine satin silk slippers that
[2:34:17] are soft and
[2:34:18] compliments of the host
[2:34:21] put them on makes that maybe it makes
[2:34:23] them feel more comfortable
[2:34:25] then your feed is washed and they pass
[2:34:27] you to another place and another man
[2:34:29] will meet you at the door
[2:34:30] he's got a little picture in his hand of
[2:34:33] some real
[2:34:34] very fine oil of spikenard or something
[2:34:38] real costly
[2:34:40] and there he would take and take him and
[2:34:43] wipe that upon on your face and wipe it
[2:34:46] with the towel all the grime and stuff
[2:34:48] off and a little on your hands there
[2:34:51] around your neck
[2:34:53] and create a smell
[2:34:56] that where you can feel refreshed and
[2:34:58] you know when you're other round you're
[2:35:00] not worried about
[2:35:01] who
[2:35:03] stink
[2:35:04] your feet is washed or you're quashed
[2:35:07] you're washed your hands are clean your
[2:35:09] face is clean
[2:35:10] and you're anointed
[2:35:13] but the pharisee
[2:35:15] he was careful
[2:35:17] to to wash dr jones's feet
[2:35:20] he was careful with the celebrity
[2:35:23] he was careful with all these other but
[2:35:26] he he let jesus sit there with dirty
[2:35:29] feet
[2:35:30] and he was never kiss welcome
[2:35:33] because that's what the host would do
[2:35:35] after your feet had been washed and your
[2:35:37] you were anointed and you're dressed
[2:35:40] with a new pair of slippers and you walk
[2:35:43] in and then you're welcomed by the host
[2:35:45] and he brings you embrace you and he
[2:35:48] kisses you on this side and kiss and
[2:35:50] gives you a kiss welcome
[2:35:53] and there jesus
[2:35:54] was in the home of simon
[2:35:57] and he was miserable sitting there no
[2:35:59] doubt
[2:36:01] the pharisees were talking about and
[2:36:03] testifying about the different things
[2:36:04] that had happened the politics and what
[2:36:06] was happening whispering about you know
[2:36:09] yeah well you know simon's got this
[2:36:11] jesus here
[2:36:12] you know
[2:36:13] he's just not like type you know and but
[2:36:15] jesus sat there with dirty feet
[2:36:18] unanointed face
[2:36:20] no kiss welcome and jesus
[2:36:23] wants to be kissed
[2:36:26] the psalmist said kiss the son
[2:36:29] lest he be angry
[2:36:32] i wonder sometimes of our our failure to
[2:36:35] kiss him welcome
[2:36:37] doesn't make him angry
[2:36:40] when he gathers among church members
[2:36:44] you know they they will let him say i'm
[2:36:46] anointed with dirty feed and be
[2:36:48] embarrassed
[2:36:50] while they're having their big time with
[2:36:52] their programs and everything else
[2:36:55] how was it a flunky like that could have
[2:36:57] passed up an opportunity
[2:37:00] how could it been that that even the man
[2:37:03] the herald that had taken the message to
[2:37:05] him your master one or my master simon
[2:37:08] wants to invite you to a feast how was
[2:37:10] it that he passed up an opportunity
[2:37:14] to say lord when i've got your attention
[2:37:17] i'm a sinner
[2:37:18] forgive me of my sins
[2:37:21] i wonder if how it can be that we can
[2:37:24] have a service
[2:37:27] i'm bringing it down to home
[2:37:29] and he will pass by
[2:37:31] and you won't say god i need a touch
[2:37:36] lord don't just believe me where you
[2:37:37] found me but lord i need my sin my
[2:37:41] unbelief
[2:37:43] maybe you hadn't been drinking and
[2:37:45] smoking and lusting or whatever but
[2:37:47] every one of us wrestled with doubts and
[2:37:49] fears not belief and we can let god i
[2:37:52] need it all washed away
[2:37:55] i need a real cleansing lord i need a
[2:37:58] purging of the holy ghost
[2:38:01] but there was a woman
[2:38:04] there was a woman passing by there that
[2:38:06] wasn't invited
[2:38:08] and she looks over there and she sees
[2:38:10] him that man that healed the sick
[2:38:13] that man that pardoned others of their
[2:38:16] sins
[2:38:17] that if he could look at jesus said he's
[2:38:19] that one oh my he's that one that
[2:38:22] forgave that other woman of seven devils
[2:38:25] oh if he could forgive her he could
[2:38:27] forgive me
[2:38:30] oh if we ever get past in our experience
[2:38:33] the amazing grace
[2:38:36] and its sweet sound
[2:38:38] that saved the wrecks like me
[2:38:41] that we can lose our experience of
[2:38:43] saying i was once lost
[2:38:46] but now i'm found
[2:38:49] i'm so glad lord i'm founded i'm so glad
[2:38:52] you found me
[2:38:54] i was a wretch i was a nobody i was lost
[2:39:05] when you get in your
[2:39:07] presence
[2:39:08] i don't know how she did it
[2:39:11] but first
[2:39:12] she went up
[2:39:14] and she
[2:39:16] got that money
[2:39:18] that she put away from her
[2:39:20] payment for her prostitution
[2:39:24] but it was all she had
[2:39:28] god don't really care what you got he
[2:39:30] just wants you to come
[2:39:35] you see you'll be a worse sinner being a
[2:39:37] pharisee
[2:39:39] then you will be a prostitute
[2:39:43] when you let jesus sit with dirty feet
[2:39:48] so there it was you know there again you
[2:39:51] know she see whether she got no
[2:39:54] she walked in and she said i want the
[2:39:56] best
[2:39:58] remember abraham get a cap young and
[2:40:00] tender
[2:40:02] we're going to give the best
[2:40:05] listen god would take any part yeah he
[2:40:07] would even take pharisees invitation
[2:40:10] jesus keeps all of his appointments if
[2:40:13] you give him 20 he'll take that 20 if
[2:40:16] you give him 30 he'll take it he'll take
[2:40:18] that 30.
[2:40:20] if you only give him sunday morning
[2:40:22] twice a month he'll take that
[2:40:26] if you just you know if you if you just
[2:40:28] give him church attendance and yet
[2:40:31] some people think church attendance is
[2:40:33] here well i'm there every time but look
[2:40:34] the devil is too.
[2:40:38] look at your life look at what you're
[2:40:40] living you ain't give him your heart
[2:40:42] you might give him church attendance you
[2:40:44] got that part well i tithe
[2:40:47] to be a lot of tithers in hell
[2:40:54] i want to give my best
[2:40:56] so she goes and gets the alabaster box
[2:41:00] full of ointment
[2:41:02] she prays
[2:41:04] all she has
[2:41:07] but it's not good enough even
[2:41:11] for this angel i'm entertaining the
[2:41:14] messiah jehovah god
[2:41:20] somehow she gets in
[2:41:23] and she gets in and she
[2:41:26] begins to
[2:41:27] put that ointment on her feet on his
[2:41:29] feet begins to kiss his feet
[2:41:33] and she's just kissing away on it and
[2:41:35] her tears
[2:41:36] her tears are coming down out of her
[2:41:38] face
[2:41:40] and it's aaron is getting water and is
[2:41:41] washing away and she don't have a towel
[2:41:43] so she just takes her long hair and she
[2:41:46] starts trying to wipe it off with her
[2:41:48] tears off his feet and she she's getting
[2:41:51] hysterical
[2:41:53] and brother brandon said when you get in
[2:41:55] his presence it makes you hysterical
[2:41:58] he said i've got hysterically any man
[2:42:01] that gets in his presence that believes
[2:42:03] him and has faith in him it'll make you
[2:42:04] hysterically on the day of pentecost
[2:42:06] when they come in the form of the holy
[2:42:08] ghost they got hysterically and when you
[2:42:10] really believe and you know and
[2:42:11] recognize it's your opportunity and
[2:42:13] you're in his presence and you're sure
[2:42:15] of it
[2:42:17] you get hysterical you get to where you
[2:42:18] don't care what everybody else thinks
[2:42:21] you get don't care whether everybody's
[2:42:23] calling you a holy roller somebody's
[2:42:25] watching on the internet the foolishness
[2:42:27] of them people dancing and shouting and
[2:42:29] screaming and getting hysterical and
[2:42:31] speaking another tone you don't worry
[2:42:33] about it
[2:42:35] it's your jesus
[2:42:37] and he's got dirty feet
[2:42:42] i want you to think of it for a moment
[2:42:45] because you see
[2:42:49] jesus is not going to come
[2:42:51] from his throne of glory and let you
[2:42:53] wash his feet
[2:42:55] but he's coming
[2:42:57] and he's appearing in dirt
[2:43:02] and he'll bring a prostitute
[2:43:04] to this altar
[2:43:06] to get in that dirt
[2:43:09] and you know what he expects when he
[2:43:11] comes in that dirt
[2:43:14] for you to welcome that
[2:43:18] not reject it
[2:43:20] come on now
[2:43:21] oh well they got hysterical and they
[2:43:23] shouted and they danced everybody was a
[2:43:26] sinner coming to christ
[2:43:29] and jesus had dirty feed and i'm going
[2:43:31] to watch the sin and the world and the
[2:43:34] unbelief off of that life
[2:43:37] [Music]
[2:43:48] you see
[2:43:49] i spoke about dress a while ago because
[2:43:51] your works express your faith
[2:43:55] that's what brother branham said and in
[2:43:56] this quote he said now let your hair
[2:43:58] grow out
[2:43:59] expresses what you believe or not that's
[2:44:01] god's word there's no scripture in the
[2:44:02] bible but that's the truth why do you do
[2:44:05] it you've noticed too much hollywood and
[2:44:07] pentecost that's what's the matter and
[2:44:10] we find out that's the truth it's too
[2:44:11] much hollywood you watch these things
[2:44:13] and pattern yourself a lady said this to
[2:44:15] me with a little tight dress on i said
[2:44:17] won't you take that to off being a
[2:44:19] sister and she said why brother branham
[2:44:22] they don't make any other clothes
[2:44:24] and that's when he said but they make
[2:44:25] sewing machines
[2:44:29] you don't have an excuse
[2:44:31] i hope you're listening to me
[2:44:33] i hope you're i hope you're
[2:44:34] understanding something here
[2:44:37] god wants to come and dwell among his
[2:44:39] people
[2:44:40] the last quote that i read of the the
[2:44:43] 1965 and the message communion when
[2:44:46] brother branham talks about anonymized
[2:44:48] sapphira and that day returning he said
[2:44:51] god is going to dwell among his people
[2:44:55] so there's somebody
[2:44:57] some oak tree somewhere
[2:45:00] some believe in church
[2:45:02] some believe in people
[2:45:04] some believe in homes that's going to
[2:45:07] invite jesus in
[2:45:09] and wash his feet
[2:45:11] hallelujah they're not ashamed of him
[2:45:14] hey man they they
[2:45:16] they are they love him with all her
[2:45:18] heart they love his appearing
[2:45:22] oh brother tim i'm no prostitute that's
[2:45:24] what brother branham said no i'm no
[2:45:26] prostitute i don't all together mean
[2:45:28] sexually prostitution on a higher level
[2:45:31] you can prostitute your time how much
[2:45:33] time do you give him prostitute your
[2:45:35] selfish motive going around well i
[2:45:37] belong to this church i'm better no
[2:45:39] you're not you can prostitute yourself
[2:45:41] other than sexually the holy spirit will
[2:45:43] speak to your heart and you say i want
[2:45:45] nothing to do with that you blind
[2:45:47] pharisee prostitute what's the matter
[2:45:49] with you committing adultery with the
[2:45:50] world that's what you're doing oh you

[2:46:00] pray and make every calm and just come
[2:46:02] and just perfect and every period just
[2:46:04] so perfect you pray so beautiful you
[2:46:06] can't talk to god like that amen you're
[2:46:09] listening to what you're saying and
[2:46:10] punctuating your prayer oh god help you
[2:46:13] to turn loose once and pray
[2:46:17] but what attitude do you take toward the
[2:46:19] lord
[2:46:21] when he wants to come and bless you i
[2:46:22] don't believe that stuff
[2:46:25] no that's fanaticism you don't find
[2:46:27] something
[2:46:29] something to criticize
[2:46:32] he wants to see he's waiting
[2:46:36] but he'll take a place in the corner
[2:46:40] one thing i don't want for evening light
[2:46:42] tabernacle
[2:46:44] is jesus in a corner
[2:46:49] i want him to have the preeminence
[2:46:53] i want him welcome
[2:46:55] i want him anointed
[2:46:58] i want him anointed even with my tears
[2:47:01] i want him anointed with my prayers
[2:47:04] hey man i want to i want to invite him
[2:47:06] with everything i have
[2:47:08] listen let me just say this to you and
[2:47:10] i'm closing trying to
[2:47:12] but as i as i'm closing for the next 30
[2:47:15] minutes
[2:47:17] i just got this to say to you
[2:47:19] you know brother branham also preached
[2:47:22] this in two other sermons at least
[2:47:25] he preached it in the laodicean church
[2:47:28] age
[2:47:29] when he preached the church ages
[2:47:31] and end time evangelism
[2:47:34] when he preached that sermon
[2:47:36] why because end-time evangelism
[2:47:40] is going to include washing jesus feet
[2:47:46] but why the laodicean age now listen who
[2:47:49] was the messenger to laodicea was it not
[2:47:52] the seventh angel
[2:47:54] do we know his name
[2:47:56] don't we know that is william branham
[2:47:59] the seventh church age messenger isn't
[2:48:01] that the truth
[2:48:03] so he comes in and he is now the vehicle
[2:48:06] the voice to speak the message of his
[2:48:08] age
[2:48:10] and he takes you right into revelation
[2:48:12] chapter 3 of christ on the outside of
[2:48:15] the door and he says the most pathetic
[2:48:18] sight i ever saw in my life for christ
[2:48:22] to get down to the last age and not in
[2:48:25] the church
[2:48:28] rejected standing on the door and
[2:48:30] knocking
[2:48:32] i want you to hear me message churches
[2:48:34] across the land and even in my
[2:48:36] tabernacle today the last place he will
[2:48:39] be rejected will be in message churches
[2:48:50] that's where
[2:48:52] the last places
[2:48:54] he will sit with dirty feet
[2:48:59] i don't want that holy roller stuff
[2:49:02] days of miracles have passed
[2:49:05] no such thing as divine healing anymore
[2:49:08] oh you're majoring on a minor
[2:49:10] oh
[2:49:12] oh
[2:49:13] and churches become like tombstones
[2:49:17] burn over
[2:49:19] had a fire of yesterday
[2:49:22] but they're dead
[2:49:24] lukewarm cold
[2:49:26] formal
[2:49:27] and don't know it right
[2:49:30] think about it
[2:49:32] oh well but it'll it'll hurt you know
[2:49:35] very pharisees looking over at him and
[2:49:37] saying oh
[2:49:38] i'll tell you that woman getting
[2:49:39] hysterical
[2:49:40] if he knew what kind of woman that was
[2:49:44] you don't you know that's going to ruin
[2:49:45] his reputation listen
[2:49:48] jesus reputation is made when he's among
[2:49:52] sinners he isn't hurt by sinners it's
[2:49:55] made in the presence of sinners
[2:49:58] and washing his feet she takes that
[2:50:00] alabaster box
[2:50:02] and she snaps the tops of it and breaks
[2:50:04] it
[2:50:05] with her glory and her tears of
[2:50:07] repentance
[2:50:09] she pours it all on her feet
[2:50:12] god have mercy upon us in this last
[2:50:14] generation
[2:50:16] it will be preached as a memorial
[2:50:19] just like as it was in the days of sodom
[2:50:22] remember lot's wife
[2:50:28] so shall it be
[2:50:30] in this laodicean church age remember
[2:50:34] the pharisee
[2:50:36] remember
[2:50:38] the harlot
[2:50:40] remember
[2:50:42] defeat
[2:50:43] jesus
[2:50:45] with dirty feet
[2:50:47] which one are you going to be
[2:50:50] which one are you going to be
[2:50:54] will you welcome him
[2:50:56] will your heart burn
[2:50:58] when you see tears of repentance
[2:51:01] when you see him come down and bless
[2:51:02] somebody when they bring joy to your
[2:51:05] heart

[3:23:37] behind it
[3:23:39] and the sisters ain't here to sing it
[3:23:41] this morning but
[3:23:42] so the room grew still as she made her
[3:23:44] way to jesus
[3:23:46] she stumbled through the tears that made
[3:23:48] her blind
[3:23:50] she felt such pain
[3:23:52] some spoken anger
[3:23:54] she heard folks whisper there's no place
[3:23:56] here for her kind
[3:23:58] still on she came to the shame that
[3:24:00] flushed her face
[3:24:02] until at last she knelt before his feet
[3:24:05] and though she spoke no words
[3:24:08] everything she said was heard
[3:24:11] as she poured out her love for the
[3:24:13] master
[3:24:14] from her box of alabaster
[3:24:17] i've come to pour my praise on him
[3:24:20] like oil from mary's alabaster box
[3:24:23] so don't be angry if i wash his feet
[3:24:25] with my tears and i dry them with my
[3:24:28] hair
[3:24:29] because you weren't that you wasn't
[3:24:31] there the night he found me
[3:24:33] you did not feel what i felt when he
[3:24:36] wrapped his love all around me and you
[3:24:38] don't know the costs of the oil in my
[3:24:42] alabaster box
[3:24:44] therefore i cannot forget the way life
[3:24:46] used to be
[3:24:47] i was a prisoner in the see it's a sin
[3:24:50] that had me bound and i spent my days
[3:24:53] pouring out my life without measure into
[3:24:55] a little treasure box i thought i'd
[3:24:57] found
[3:24:58] until the day when jesus came to me
[3:25:02] and he healed my soul with the wonder of
[3:25:04] his touch
[3:25:05] so now i'm giving back to him all the
[3:25:07] praise he's worthy of i've been forgiven
[3:25:11] and that's why i love him so much
[3:25:15] hallelujah
[3:25:18] hallelujah you've been forgiven much
[3:25:22] therefore you can love much
[3:25:24] oh there's nothing wrong with pouring
[3:25:26] out your praise
[3:25:28] and giving him the glory and the honor
[3:25:30] and the position and the place he
[3:25:32] deserves
[3:25:34] hallelujah no one else may know the cost
[3:25:37] but you know
[3:25:39] they wasn't there the day he found you
[3:25:42] and he wrapped his arms around you and
[3:25:44] he pulled himself to you
[3:25:46] oh amazing grace where would i be
[3:25:50] if it wasn't for his touch
[3:25:53] for his mercy
[3:25:55] and his grace
[3:25:57] hallelujah
[3:25:59] hallelujah if not for grace
