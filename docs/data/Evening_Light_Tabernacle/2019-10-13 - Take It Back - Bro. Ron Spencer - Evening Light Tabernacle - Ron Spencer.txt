family reunion this week and we're having two different kinds of family reunions but Amen brother William works with us in the ministry team there at home thank you for being here god bless you too see my haven't we heard some good word I thought this morning just was just over the top I I stood up and I said I am a son of God amen I'd like to just take a simple thought for just a little bit this afternoon take it back for brother Josh this should be a special spot to start from for Samuel chapter 25 and verse 3 my voice goes completely out brother Wayne will be taking over for me so brother Wayne will be praying for me more than anybody in the building now the name of the man was Mabel and the name of his wife was Abigail now I want you to just watch this just for a moment this is what God thought of her I would like to be complimented like this and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance I like it when God tells us were beautiful but the man was Kurdish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of Caleb turn with me to First Samuel chapter 30 and verse 1 and it came to pass that when David and his men were come to see glad on the third day that the Amalekites had invaded the south and zyg leg and smitten zyg leg and burned it with fire and taken the women captives that were there in they slew not any either small or great but carried them away and went on their way and David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives and David and the people that were with him fill their voice and lifted their voice and wept until they had no more power to we have you ever been there in your life till you came to a valley until you come to a spot to where you had no more power to mourn or to weep or had a word to say and David's two wives were taken captives him and the Jezreel is and Abigail the wife of night ball that comer light and David was greatly distressed for the people speak of stoning him because the soul of all the people was greed and every man for his sons and for his daughters notice these words but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God you may be seated to see me we read a lot of chapters of David in new year we see a lot of victories we see some Wars David was also honest and told us of the defeats and the horrible things that he had to go through in his life this was a tough spot David was exiled he was running he was in a difficult spot to start off with he's fighting enemies at every captive they're single at every situation he was back was against the wall and he's has men that have gathered with him you know if you want to know what kind of a person you are look around at what God gathers to you God mighty men that were around him men that were willing to fight willing to give their life willing to give everything that they had because they believed that David was on his way to be the king they were following his leadership they were following him pass he was making his way and they believed that he was ordained of God they believed he was elected and they believed he was anointed of God and they get into a battle to which that they are going to win and they're going to have incredible victory and they're away from their wives and their homes and and they're away from everything that they loved and they went to battle with David the king and they have smoked the enemy and they have rejoiced and they danced and they took balls and now they're on their way back now there's a lot of different kind of enemies that we have to fight in this day just like David had to fight and Philistine is one that will meet you out front he is the one that will call your bluff he's the one that will scream at you and holler at you and blabbered to you you remember there was one like that that we could pronounce in the scriptures that tells us that there was a Goliath and Goliath was screaming is there anybody over there that will come and meet the challenge of the Aleph and they had all kind of fun of God and all whole fun of the children of Israel and you know come I could do that all that he wanted to until David showed up Laodicea can scream all she wants to until the bride of Jesus Christ stand to her feet and realizes that she's the invincible army on the earth in this day David was fighting these kind of men but there was another kind of an enemy called an Emily cot that's the con that will sweep him behind you while you're away fighting wars while you're away having victories and he'll come into your house he'll come to your house and try to steal your children and steal your life steal your home and try to destroy your courage let me just talk to you a little bit about your home it is the place that God gives you as a sanctuary it's a place that where you apply token and then it's a place away from the world it's a place that you don't want to have to put up with worldly women and all kind of worldly music and all kind of demon spirits it's a sanctuary it's a sanctuary to where you can enjoy your wife and enjoy your children and a place to where you can rest you can have the battles out in the world but you can come home and be yourself come on you can take your armor off for a little bit you can take your helmet off a little bit you can set down your couch and enjoy your wife and enjoy your children but it takes a dirty rotten devil that will come and try to steal that away from you are you with me tonight David they're making their way home it's a three-day journey they're on their way home you know there's just something about going home it's kind of like a meeting like this but after you come toward the end you start making your way home there's something about going home an old horse can work in the field all day long but when he recognizes this I'm going to the barn touch these ears up the shoulders kind of stretch back he's ready to go home you kind of feel that way after a long day's work it's like a resurrection happens do you work eight ten twelve hours and all of a sudden you know you get ready to go home your wife's there with iced tea and she's going to meet you at the front door and she's gonna hug your neck and you're gonna sit down on the couch it and she's gonna climb up on your lap and and hug you and make you feel good that's a quote I just gave you a quote not my world oh yeah somebody on the same man somewhere well we had me not the church on time tomorrow now when they come across the hill they saw smoke you know smoke in the enemy's camp it's one thing smoke at your house is a different thing let me say it again smoke at the enemy's camps one thing smoke at your house is a different thing you know what it happens to somebody else's well you tell them I'll pray for you I'll encourage you I've done a lot of things for you but what about when it happens at your house now let me just drop back David's the king but he's gathered some treasures in his life we've all gathered some treasures that we think a lot of but there's no treasure like a man's wife now the woman that he has gathered is one of his wives being under different dispensation but there was a lady named Abigail that would come into David's life let me just talk to you for a moment about her Abigail her first husband was cruel to her he was an outer worshipper he was a college man he was a brutal beast he did not appreciate what he had the Scriptures talks about that abigail was a woman of good understanding if you do any study there's only just a couple of women in the entire scriptures that God calls wise so this woman is not only beautiful but she's brains too I wanted to talk to you just a moment about your first husband your first husband your nature he was brutal he was an idol worshiper he was cruel to you he meets you and mulch you and make fathered you and he never told you who you really was that you were the queen of heaven that you were the daughter of God but one day one day extract your life [Applause] if we could only realize it don't have to be that way this woman though she be serving under him had respect for him the king would have destroyed them had it not been for her incredible wisdom amazing God knows how to get us but not only does God know how to get us he knows how to keep us with me now she is one of the women with the children that when the enemy came he didn't kill him but he took him away captive and then taken away captive he takes some as a treasure as a hostage as a trophy that's what sake wants to do young people adults no matter your age he'd not to take you captive he with me but I want you to remember just one long letter that she was the wife of Nepal she was still in God's mind the wife of David she was still in God's mind a captive to the Amalekites she was still in God's mine god never forgets shoes he never forgets you David looks over though this city that once was the scripture said that they wept until they can't wait no more they was overwhelmed at their loss they was overwhelmed at how difficult this moment was reaching to somebody sometimes we come to a spot in our life until the moment is so difficult without the help of God we can't make it through it David's a key he feels the responsibility of leadership he's got generals captain's foot soldiers each one of them have suffered the same loss so he don't only have loss for himself he has lost for everybody else everybody takes grief a different way what if I was in those shoes this is what I do really but what about the whole place under the same situation now we do what humans do we blamed somebody we've been ready to blame somebody and so we blame the pastor we blame King David because we're in this situation this is a familiar story Jesus if you'd have been home Jesus if you'd have been home our brother would not have died brother Brandon if you want no honey you can appraise for this one in the hospital but there was a caribou that had to be killed and a grizzly bear that had to be killed we look through our selfish eyes because of our situation and then our moment overcomes us I'm gonna get there in just a moment hang with me they even speak of stoning him the man only a few days ago they were fighting a powerful turning with their eyes looking to make sure he would be okay looking across the hill and watching for David in the battle is he okay and they're finding them they're killing the enemy and they're looking to see David is okay and now the enemy started their ear the enemy's got their ear and blaming the preachers because of my trouble it's the preachers fault it's God's fault can I preach to you tonight listen this is what God made on my heart here we are it's hard for me to imagine that you'd start writing blogs against the messenger that was sent to deliver you it's hard to believe that you'll come to a spot to work because of the failures of life and the failures of your home that you would want to destroy the message that has been sent to deliver you these men were fighting for David and they had their eyes on David the reason people get disappointed he's got their eyes on a man why is all of these camps and the message got disappointed they got their eyes on a man and when the Amalekites came and destroyed their home they forgot about God who is the resource of all of our friends now I want you to just notice here but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God I want you to understand tonight you got to come to a spot to where you encourage yourself but there's not a preacher man there's not a meeting that's going on you got to stop and you got to go back to this right here not to your website but go to these sites and encourage yourself read your name in the books read your spot in the books reading right here this is my spot this is my power this is my time this is my battle God said he'd take care of me I'm not sick Claire eats myself if God [Applause] well since it's my turn applause well preach everybody hear me okay don't relax too much brother when we in my distress I called upon the Lord this is David's writings in my distress I called upon the Lord and I cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears some twenty five and one unto the oka all the Lord how do you lift up my soul oh my god I trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph over me some thirty forty one I will bless the Lord at all times how would you tell your neighbor I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth 34 Nate okay stir and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him sums 40 in verse 1 I waited patiently for the Lord and he climbed into me and heard my cry he brought me up out of a horrible pit on about miry clay and set my feet upon the solid rock and established my goings why are they following and cast it down on my soul why art thou disquieted within me hope thou and God for I shall yet praise Him who is the health of my countenance and my god 56 and one be merciful unto me O God for man will swallow me up he fight with me daily and oppress of me my enemies were daily swallow me up and they that be many that fight against me o thy Most High what time I'd be afraid I will trust in thee sums 2071 the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I feel the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies sent my phone's came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not feel though war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life don't quit Church in trouble well I got a little upset the preacher didn't shake my hand I'm gonna lay out a church you didn't quit going to lo Mart [Music] come on you didn't quit pull it for LSU I'm amazed that people squabble about noise in church when they used to go analog in they used to play rock and roll music so loud you couldn't stand in the car come on it's an interesting level the fights against us in a time when you said of all things screaming and shouting and getting cold spending incredible money he didn't machen screaming it shouting but when you come to church can you start clapping yeah hey and some start screaming Alleluia they'd be good stuck out here you're gonna get in the flash I'd like to tell the kingdom of hell your kingdom is [Music] though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not feel the war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing I've desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire nice simple notices next words for in the time of trouble for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle Shelley hide me and he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about therefore will I offer in this Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing they I will see them to the court but one but you know hunter I've served the Lord and all I can see its mistakes I look around him I see mistakes and David we're having been away a house wouldn't have been destroyed it you know if David makes the mistakes that he's made we wouldn't be destroyed I looked in the scriptures and I can't see it myself I'm looking by the branch message and I see mistakes and you know I was I was promised a double portion God always keeps his promise I'd like to remind you that you are who you are because God said who you are and where you get in trouble is you start having unbelief about what God said to us Jesus looked at the scriptures to see what it said about him you listen to sermons listen to the prophet of God and read this to see what it says about you and then you believe what God said about you and you take the oddities word one time there was two men that was welcomed together you're right there was two men that was walking together what had been the mightiest prophet in all of Israel there were schools of the message that was around that thought they had better interpretations but this man only kept his eyes on the Prophet guys were telling just stop he's going to be going away just stop he kept his eyes on the Prophet this prophet had incredible major miracles to happen in his life and this man named Elisha was following him and he just kept his eyes on the message because he knew the message had power within it he was kind of like Ruth just stay in the field in each just stay there don't go nowhere else just stay in the field and eat so he kept his eyes on Elijah Elijah tried to get him discouraged and maybe go somewhere else he kept his eyes on finally one day they have a conversation what is your desire I want to dump a Porsche of what you got the scripture said greater is He that's in me than he that's in the world I want that description said is he about in me and my words abide in you I won't touch the scripture said greater than these showed you do I want that the scripture said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I love the scripture said there's going to be a resurrection I love that this picture said there's going to be a rapture I want I want everything in the book what what you're asking for is a hard thing but if you see me when I go so they came down to the body of water and they come to that place a larger took his coat off and he smoked the water and they walked across a lot ship believed it so he walked with him and they went over to the other side and you see Elijah was looking in this meeting that he was getting into half and there was chariots parked at every bush brother Brendan setting left those other chariots for me and you and he climbed up inside his chariot I didn't begin to go up and as it was going up Elijah stood there then Elijah took these mantle off he fell right down from Elijah now better Brendan said this he said God did not cut the rope to fill Elijah he cut Elijah to fit the role it's not will this message fit you it's will you set the match suits there will be a bride there will be an invincible army that will be wise I happen to be one of them [Applause] now hemming in here this building has had a critic let's go ahead and raise her hands had a critic how would you look around Blaine raise a mic up this is an exercise class after church I want to meet you that don't have any critics I want you to write a book on how to live life without a critic but let me just go ahead and answer the question before Gentiles people that have no critics have done nothing and whether you know it or not the critic is actually what makes you the masterpiece I know one horse I hope it got through the critic actually won testifies that you're a masterpiece no Elijah no doubt when he came back he took the road and smoked the same body of water he had asked for a double portion wonder how those people knew that he was going to get a double portion he testified about it that's what your critics do they listen to your testimony and you only testify what the word says about you so he walks back to the same body of water and he says these words where is the nor God of Elijah the same God that lived in Elijah what Jesus Christ and that same God that lived in that body lives inside of you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what and then another miracle happens - and then another miracle happens through then American other miracle happens soul and Elijah comes to a spot in his life - where he's now getting weak that's when you create extort coming he's one short I don't know if you'll know it but you know the message can't be right it was one short that proves that Elijah was wrong and now a lot is wrong he's one short yeah remember it wasn't a man that made the promise william branham didn't make the promise God made you the promise they're one of the lodges that made the promise that made the promise hell I should knew the God that did all the other miracles is in charge of that last one so he realizes that death angel has taken a grip and he remembers the promise here a few years ago we were here and sister Mariah was in a prayer line the same night but Aaron Oglesby a miracle happens in his life we had a vision of my daughter who could not have children you know you start speaking about a vision and then the devil starts whispering you start speaking about what God says and then the devil starts whispering I might as well kill some devils while I'm preaching and so on that's where we're going the sense a child she couldn't have a child she was born with the defect in her womb she couldn't have children but I'm not the one that said then my son-in-law is an accident and it crashes his pelvis and crushes his backbone and crushes his shoulder you've heard this over and over again I touch the other not brother Tim fruit even comes and prays with him at the hospital but the state you can testify this if you're really wanting to die don't invite brother Tim to come pray for you [Applause] do you think that the devil didn't whisper in my ear do you say God said that she was gonna have a child now it really looks impossible it really looks impossible you might end up you I don't know lots of comfort in the scriptures so I encourage myself in the scriptures sorry it had to go slow but so when all the critics were stalling me I encouraged myself in the scriptures God told Abraham you're gonna have a son [Applause] God told him you're gonna have a son it didn't matter what anybody else said God said I'm gonna have a son I'm gonna have it by Sarah God said so if it's up to God God will bring it to pass Donna bring it to pass if God's isn't gonna bring it to pass if God said it gotta bring it to pass I want you to get it it not matter what the critic says him count your days and count your months and count your time it don't matter if God said it [Applause] hello he'll bring in Japan not a bankrupt heavens to take care of his word this message is the truth you don't have to clear the saucer kind of figure it all out God will bring it to pass he's chasing at his heel prick [Applause] you know if I was a believer of Elijah I don't want to carry his bones what would your brother honey he's one short I might be the miracle I might be the miracle so let me carry his bones let me pack his body to the grave let me carry it to the tomb hold for a while they wait a minute - and I could hear all the whispers one short please how boss begin to deteriorate and Stan begin to deteriorate his hair begin to go back skin attention and literally it was just his bones laying her dry and I was a war that was happening [Applause] there was a war that was happening and a man got killed in the wall and something picked him up and they started tearing and they were fleeing and they came to a home and they throw his body in on those bones I'm gonna throw that party in those bones that dead party came alive God fulfilled its work God raised this puppy up God heal these lungs I told God in that in that office right back there but my soul by myself and the enemy was telling me you're not gonna breach to not look back over your old notes on and I laid my hands on your old folks I'm sorry if it's a private chamber I'm sorry if i trespassed a little bit but I went there leave my son brother Kim's old notes and I said God you raised a crippled boy up to be one the greatest man ever preached in the whole world and you're the God arranged Summa you're the God that can heal this throat that I could preach the Word of God thought your people need to hear take it back can you give me just a couple more moments now David encouraged himself in the Lord when he figured out that I can't put no trust in now these guys here I can only put my trust in him so David said in that habit are the priests I'm Alicia's son I pray they bring me hither he applauded abbath Arbour halted their day he fought to David and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after this truth shall i overtake them and he answered I love it when god says pursuit [Applause] for Laos you're surely overtake them and without fail recover all can't you give me about five minutes I [Applause] don't care what the devil has stole from you I don't care how big how bad how ugly the devil has been that is came in your life and it's robbed Jim your victory and Rob took your joke and robbed Junko help and Rob took your strength watching your children blah blah gotcha pursue God sent over and recovers [Applause] God has told you that you're his sons this week [Applause] what has he told us he'll find my balance [Applause] what has he told to sue this week you're armed and dangerous [Applause] you're leaving back sleep tonight you don't have to stay that way you're living with complexes tonight you don't have to stay that way you're living it up and down like you don't have to
