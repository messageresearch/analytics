that were kind of playing with some radium that was to to paint the radium hands on watches the girl made a mistake and took the brush stuck in her mouth it killed her many years later they took a microscope or some type of equipment and put it on the skull of that girl and she could still they could still hear that radium going on berber it's endless it keeps working on it on and that's what they discovered he said oh brother if radium has that kind of effect in us how much more will the endless eternal supernatural all-powerful all-infinite almighty god hallelujah he has to have the same effect as he started he has to have it all the way through where he's not the almighty all-powerful god he's still waiting for somebody with a burly faith that will step out and challenge the enemy on the basis of his word and say it's so amen that's us today we're here to say that word is true itself amen i believe there are men and women with burning faith hallelujah that'll meet the enemy right

your dusty road [Music] [Music] coming down [Music] when jesus did speak he said your daughter's not dead she's just asleep and then he turned to all the unbelievers and he told them all about how he

to bring to passover promise that he made in this book amen what an hour to live what a what a time to be manifesting of the grace of god amen i i tell you what a what a day amen to think about what he's done for us to get us to this place and the grace that he showed us in our lives amen i i tell you sometimes i think about that little woman a man that went to the feet of jesus and they sing a song says you don't know because you wasn't there the night that he saved me and i tell you if you ever been saved you don't never get over that if you ever been freed by the master you don't never get over that i know we get hard-hearted in this age but i can't hear somebody talk about my lord without it just doing something on the inside of me amen amen i i tell you i i pray to god that i don't never lose the feeling to serve him and to love him amen amen i want to say god bless you this morning certainly an honor to be in the house of god and amen we have enjoyed these meetings my goodness my son zach called me uh yesterday he said daddy said i got to catch you first service he said it was a blessing we heard brother ron he said it must feel pretty good to be able to preach meetings with guys you'd go drive to hear i said it does it does i mean so i if i wasn't preaching i'd be here i'd love these men of god and the sermons have enjoyed last night my goodness my goodness brother donald got to talking about my champion glory what a champion amen what a what a mighty god amen and we we certainly love these men and want to give you our greetings today from brother erickson and the church there true word tabernacle say god bless you and the saints that are here with us we've got several from the church and thank you all for coming and and being a support today amen we just want to this morning maybe just to bow our hearts in a word of prayer amen um sometimes we just we just take a moment and just speak to him because he's the important one in the building and we we want to ask him to come and and take a hold of this meeting this morning heavenly father is the feelings in the building the grace lord the liberty that is here lord we want to take a moment to praise you the god that hung the stars and the heavens and the lord makes the sun shine every morning nobody ever had to go propping it up or nobody whatever had to brighten it but because your word spoke over it there's power in it or it burns every morning it brightens every day and father we thank you lord we thank you for that grace that you've done in our life that wakes us up in the morning gets us moving lord speaks to our lives and lord we'd just like to invite you into this meeting in a special way this morning may you step into this building lord lord by your word may it may it come into every heart lord but you speak into every need there there are needs here in this building there's lives that need changing lord there's hearts that have questions lord and you're the answer you're the answer to every heart you're the grace to every need lord and we invite you lord to come and lord this morning there at home i know there's needs uh brother robert's in the hospital i pray that you'd touch him and lord there's those that are homebound that i just asked for your grace and for the thompson family this morning may your hand of grace be over them lord we asking you today that you would come and meet the needs lord of every person this congregation those that are viewing lord now may you be merciful to us father we commit this in thine hands in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen and god bless you this morning if you have your bibles we would like to go to the scripture in the book of joel the second chapter in the 28th verse joel chapter 2 and verse 28 amen joel 2 and 28. very tremendous old testament prophecy of the day that we live and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy and their old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions brother branham uses this scripture a lot in the message in the book of romans the 8th chapter in the 11th verse paul in the new testament speaking of this same happening but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you by his spirit that dwelleth in you may god bless you this morning as you be seated i'd like to just speak to you a little bit today uh up on this topic and i'd like to take this title i think it's the ev first time i've ever took a title here uh but this is the dynamics are here the dynamics are here i think it's a very a very awakening time for the church of the living god i believe it's an hour such as such as no man's ever been able to live or to be able to be in so i pray god give us the ability to get a hold of the time that we live and to see what kind of age that we're in and allow us to recognize where we're standing and the rise of the sun in 1965 paragraph 107 the first chief come up from all the prophets which was the son of god the king of all the prophets and there has been churches and churches and brides and brides and churches and brides but there's got to come one there has got to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it now look what he said he said there's got to come a real bride and that real bride's going to have both the mechanics and the dynamics of it that makes the church live it moves in the power of his resurrection until we come to the place that we find that what good does it do to polish the hood what good does it do to give a face like a lift or seminize the job when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there has got to be a dynamics that will make it work no matter how much we can stand and prove that it's right there has to be something that makes it go to work something's got to make it work in our lives now in paragraph 110 brother branham will say this that's what he proved hallelujah that's what easter proved that he wasn't only the word but he was god himself i the preacher in me wants to stop and preach an hour on the god head right there amen to all these people that separated our lord in half a dozen places i think they could read these things that help them he said that but he was god himself the dynamics in the word he wasn't only the word but he was god himself the dynamics in the word and that made the body of our jesus christ cold stiff and dead and in the grave shake into the life and rise again roll away the stone he said i am he that was dead so dead to the sun he he was so dead till the sun was dead the moon he was excuse me he was rolling with the stone i am he that was dead so dead to the sun amen he was so dead to the moon said he was dead the stars said he was dead nature said he was dead the whole world has to recognize now that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics he was god's word he was the dynamics to prove it and he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations that any other has spoke of the bride see it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh she is born of his bone she has a life of his life she has power of his power oh brother adam says it wonderfully she is him and a man or a woman and a woman taken from his side she had been taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side both made mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics a man made mechanics and dynamics that's who the bride is she is the flesh of him but she's also the spirit of him where did eve get the particles for her body from adam where did eve get her spirit it was from adam she was both his flesh and his blood and his spirit and so is the church of the living god she's not only the word but she is the spirit that was taken from jesus christ that makes that word live within our lives see to say that you're the bride means you're saying you are both mechanics and dynamics unless you're that you cannot be the bride amen but if you're that then the spirit of it is going to prove amen who you are the dynamics of it it's his mechanics do you see now brother adam will say it like this again amen now after the all these easter bunnies and ceremonies and churches and finally he said they'll pass away but the church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride for he had said in john 14 that he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and i give him a charge amen i'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics and the world will not be able to withstand it and amen look at that amen god is going to put something in his word amen that the devil the world the the economy will not be able to withstand it'll be a charge see it'll be a charge in the dynamics amen the world would not be able to do it i'll raise him up again in the last day now brother adam you've heard him teach on my thanksgiving message and you remember they're invisible you did right here at shreveport he preaches it and he comes down he's preached pretty much the whole sermon and then he stops and he says now but my my message to you is that you've never done it in the first place he said now that's the thanksgiving message to you well in the eastern message and rising of the sun he's preached a long ways into it and then he stops and just like in that message he says in the easter message and he said that's my easter's message that the dynamics and the mechanics are together now this is the message of the last day this is the easter message to the church amen the mechanics and the dynamics are together if you're still looking for the dynamics you have missed the message if you're still looking for the dynamics of god to come you have missed the message of the hour the mechanics amen have now become the dynamics by the spirit that is moving in them amen now listen he said the mechanics without the dynamics is no good and neither is the dynamics without the mechanics it'll take both amen the word and the spirit it'll take both of them amen you can scream and shout and jump up all down all you want to and deny this word and it won't do you any good you're just cranking around on the pistons there's no spark to fire no gasoline to fire it by it'll only work as it comes together it will only do that see and the other one will go up that's the only thing there is to it they most both look alike they both claim to be churches they both claim to be bribed but one has got mechanics and dynamics and it brings it to pass of what is said is true see it won't just move see no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics comes when the dynamics comes he says that's the fire that is made to connect with the gasoline when he explodes and causes combustion and moves every motion and every move he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of god that's the mechanics with the dynamics it's the spirit that quickens it's the spark that fires you see there's got to come something on the word that'll make it live amen i know it's sitting here today watching this congregation throughout these meetings i think it's a powerful thing to see of course you see great moves in the in the pentecostal world you see a great emotional carrying on and things like that but pick up the scripture one time and it'll become a very quiet place amen pick up a little bit of doctrine on predestination or the truth spirit or the true baptism and everything will quieten way down amen but that's not the case with the bride of jesus christ they're just as carried away with the word of god as they are a good song because their revival is not coming from the music the revival is not coming amen from the church building the revival is not coming from the atmosphere the revival is coming from the word and the word is creating music and the word is creating revival and the word is creating churches and the word is creating buildings amen we're not just another church amen but this is the bride that is connected both the mechanics and the dynamics together in the last days amen in the rise of the sons a powerful sermon brother adam says that all of a sudden the dynamics will come and what did it do it not only filled their spirit inside but it quickened the mechanics their bodies were quickened they were no more cowards they went right up into the face of people and said you men of judea and you that dwell in jerusalem before the dynamics comes see they were just mechanics see now watch what they do you men that dwell in jerusalem let this be known and hearken to my words these are not drunk as you suppose i'm one of them this is that i'll show you what it is it's the scripture this is that and i've always said if this ain't that let me keep this till that comes amen no this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel it shall come to pass in the last days saith the lord i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh now watch brother branham's interpretation of that scripture i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh the dynamics will come into the mechanics amen then then they wasn't afraid anymore amen people all the time you hear people preaching joel chapter two amen and the spirit we poured out and they keep saying and when the dynamics comes and when the dynamics comes and when the dynamics comes but according to william branham when joel chapter 2 said i'll pour out my spirit he said that's the dynamics that's coming into the mechanics amen and i don't know about you i'm not here today waiting for the dynamics to come i am here to enjoy the benefits of the dynamics of god that is coming to the church of the living god in the last days we are not here just passing time we're not here just amen just getting together we have come together to worship in the spirit of god amen until every situation of our lives are changed until everything drops away from us and we line up to the word of god thus saith the lord word by word line by line a word bride in the last days amen not just an emotional church a bride full of the word of god i know what i'm talking about you have a good meeting and there's a there's a thousand philistines out there to market to be just an emotional workup amen after we have a good meeting there'll be people all over the country criticizing well just a bunch of emotion just a bunch of this don't you let that devil water this down to an emotional time or just an emotional happening there is more going on in the house of god and just a building of emotion and working this is the preaching of the greatest revelation that has ever struck the face of the earth jesus christ the son of god i propose to you he is not dead this morning i propose to you he's not in jerusalem this morning he's right here in the house of god filled in the hearts of men and women of god don't you lift that devil water this down or put a bad reputation amen and make it seem like something is wrong with it well if there is something wrong with enjoying the spirit of god amen then let me be wrong but there's something in my heart that says it's right this is the way the first church acted this is the way the real church acted they got their hearts full of the holy ghost and they lost their fear of man and they lost their fear of people what they would have to say about it i think it's high time let the spirit of grace take the fear out of your heart to worship god without dictation of man without the ideas of man i know what i'm talking about you can get the devil cast out of you you can enjoy this weekend and before monday morning the devil will come along and tell you you just got in motion you just had an emotional worker that's a lying devil and all he's done to come and to steal and to kill and destroy you know what he's coming to do he's coming to take away that experience you prayed your whole life to have amen and if he can convince you that that's not a real experience it does no good to get it amen but if god ever gives a man an experience and he knows it comes from god it doesn't make any difference what the devil says or what a thousand philistines have to say i know in whom i believed i know the god that i serve is a real god oh yes son i read about shamgar in the bible i love the bible just a short verse but a prophet can bring a lot out of it he said a thousand six hundred philistines he said come to get amen meant shamgar's uh harvest didn't he you know what brother man said he said he'd come back to tell him it was just in motion that's what them philistines did come back just tell you to take the experience that god gave you now if you let him do it it don't matter how many services you're in it don't matter how many times god blesses you and feels you and gives you anointing until you're ready to receive what is happening to you until you're ready to accept it and confess it as such as god has given in this age i have no hesitation in telling you what i have received amen comes from joel the second chapter it comes from acts the second chapter it comes to romans the eighth chapter i am anointed of the lord to preach the gospel of jesus christ i didn't accept some emotional spirit i received the spirit of jesus christ that raises the dead he raised me out of a dead dark denominational world and filled me with a holy ghost and i ain't giving it back and i ain't let the devil take it away from me no sir i may not be educated but i got a weapon i got the weapon of the spirit the sword of the lord is the weapons of our warfare and they may not be carnal but they're very mighty preachers what are you saying i think it's time to pick something up and beat that devil off of you i said something on the beat here the day of northern arkansas i was preaching kind of come along this experience thing you can see demons just move throughout the earth i was talking this brother about experience i was preaching about it actually and i was preaching about this very point little sham guard took his oxnard run that devil off of experience and said it was emotion and when i said that there was a look coming this man's eye he's probably 60-year-old man sitting there been out of church for years just come back recently and he's sitting there and i seen a real strange expression come in his face and like a release of something big tears started crying he said most he don't hardly move it off he just said some watches and that's okay those are receiving something hey man he was sitting there and when and when that was finished after the service he met me out front he said bro wayne i got something tell you i said you do he said yeah he said years ago i was in a tent meeting up in hardy arkansas and said the spirit of god came and the atmosphere was powerful and god gave me something he gave me an experience i literally was in an experience with the holy ghost and power he said i come back to the church he said and somebody said to me oh then things happen to people all the time and they go off to the side they lose their mind and he said you know what i let somebody tell me that it was just a fanatical happening now i want y'all to hear me that happened in the 1970s and in the year 220 i'm preaching to this man it's years 50 years later and in the moment he realizes that really was an experience with god he went right back to it amen and he remembered being god's always kept his word he just didn't believe what god was doing for him and i don't know if you're recognizing really what is happening really what has taken place it's not just another good meeting it's the dynamics of the power of god that is prophesied in the scriptures in the last days i shall pour out my spirit saith the lord i shall restore some of you god's done wonderful things for you but you let an old devil take it away from you you let the devil tell you it wasn't real and it was emotional and it was this or it was that that was the devil lying but if you would reach back into your memory and get a hold of that experience it was real it really was real and it'll become a reality you know what i'm talking about god can do a miracle but you've got to be willing to accept it god can heal you but you got to be willing to accept it he can see him the greatest revival the world has ever saw but you've got to accept it oh yeah it's real it's a real dynamics it's a real power amen and his promise for this last day you said by the way if the dynamics is here amen if the dynamics is here tell me tell me about it well let me tell you what brother branham says he said mechanics don't run a church it's the dynamics the holy ghost gets into the word so it's not a seminary that teaches you theology and greek interpretations it's the dynamics of the holy ghost in there to set a fire and to bring it to pass now now i love the balance of the scripture and the quotes and some people will take that and they'll run off to the other side and say you don't need no word and if i was the devil that's what i'd say because he's going to get his weapon on that word [Applause] if god's in it but if god ain't in it the bible said the letter killeth but the spirit gives it life [Applause] so i appreciate the men of god that take time to go in the scripture and bring out the powerful points amen and to bring out the greek and show what it is amen as long as the spirit's in it it'll have a power and anointing upon the church it'll feed your soul now the dynamics of the holy ghost is in there to set a fire and to bring it to pass and to make it live just exactly what the promised word is for this hour not the mechanics the dynamics is it it takes mechanics and dynamics the word and the spirit are there the one that gives it life that's what gives it life now you said preacher where is that dynamics that then brother brown says it like this he says if the spirit that raised him from the day of the word he said the dynamic of the word dwells in you it will quicken your mortal body say my mortal body my mortal that one you fight with that troubled one that evil one that's on the outside don't see taste fill smell and hear those senses that you fight on a daily basis come on they won't be converted till you get a body change so it's a mortal body are you hearing me it's a mortal body it's a it's a it's a it's a complete war with that outside man but look what he says here amen if the spirit that raised up jesus from the god dwells in you it'll quicken that body now the flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone because quickly you were yet mortal sinners ready to die but it quickens that body what does it do it brings life the spirit that once drank can run around and commit adultery it's all quickened why the thing died and you are resurrected it quickens your mortal body this dynamic spirit moves you from a mortal to immortal creature right now immortality does not begin when you die immortality begins when the dynamics of god comes into your life come on church you're a millionaire trapped in an old rapid body you're a son of god trapped into a body of sin that gives you a war but on the inside of that body is a son of god that was coming from god before the worlds ever began for your body therefore your body is in my body that for your body this thing you're wary and this thing you're living in he said it's the temple of the dynamics where's god going to have church know you not that ye are the temples not not mortar and brick flesh and blood amen not amen not an immortal body a mortal body god's word is so powerful it doesn't matter where you put it it'll take over you can put it in a drunkard's life it'll take over you can put it in a smoker's life it'll take over because there's a seed on the inside that is the conqueror of the earth and once christ comes into the heart he'll take over step by step peace my speech you become the dynamics you become the temple of his dynamics i tell you that's worth the sermon by itself isn't it the temple of his dynamics that's where church really happens that's where things are really going on amen in that temple of dynamics because from the beginning you are a part of the mechanics oh listen to the prophet from the beginning you're a part of the mechanics what's he saying you were an attribute he's saying in the beginning you were the word you're a part of the father but it laid in you dormant amen and you see as long as that seed lays dormant there's no power in that life amen but when the dynamics comes upon it he moves you into a temple a dynamic power you become a powerhouse brother brown said i didn't come to build denominations i come to build powerhouses do you see what this message has come to do it's come to make a powerhouse out of you you're not here in laodicea to be under the elements of this life and this world god come to bring and make a powerhouse out of your life and overcomer of the life that you're living in it's the temple of the dynamics these bodies right now oh there's your resurrection it's the church and the resurrection within these bodies right now can you say right now are quickened they are quickened right now you've heard you believe it you're changed from denomination to the word already quickened amen you say well how can i identify the dynamics in my life brother brown said the dynamics of the church will be a refilling of the holy ghost it'll be a refilling of the holy ghost he said preacher what are you talking about i'm talking about acts the second chapter i'm talking about 120 million who was in the upper room who had mechanics in their life who was jean seeds of god before the world began but but peter was running and cussing he didn't have it he had a fear in his heart to tell him what had happened to his life but that morning they waited about 10 days and a spirit of unification come among them until they unified on the promise of god they took the promise amen that if you'll terry in jerusalem the promise of my father will come upon you which was isaiah the 28th chapter with stammering lips and other tongues well i send them to my people our refreshing shall come unto you and peter knew that was the scripture and james knew and john knew and jesus had identified what they were waiting on ten days they were waiting [Applause] [Music] unifying 10 days on one scripture i bet by then they got all the nonsense out of the building 10 days amen unified on one promise they didn't come to be seen they didn't come to be heard they didn't come amen to exercise their abilities they come for a promise of god in their life and god had made a promise and he was there to fulfill a promise upon their life ten days into it the bible said when the day of pentecost had fully come when the day of pentecost had fully come now y'all know that was a y'all know that was a tradition down there in jerusalem and there was a bunch of pentecostals out there in the streets amen that's what they were all doing there that morning they were all in the streets but those 120 were in an upper room they were actually not the pentecostals they were the church of the firstborn and the pentecostas were the traditionals of that time but when the pillar of fire came in the room it was a fulfillment of the promise of god and the dynamics of the spirit came into their lives now let me tell you what he'd done it quicken them [Applause] it quickened their lives it didn't just come in and tingle them a little bit it quickened their mortal bodies amen brother braham said it's so quick in them it quickened their language i know people can't hardly stand the idea of speaking in tongues anymore i don't know what bible you're reading i don't know what i don't know what book of acts you've been reading lately but i think it was three out of five times and somebody received the holy ghost they actually did speak in tongues and we're not going to pentecostal doctrine i know there's some critics out there that'll clip that and make it say whatever they wanted to say but there's a reality to these things for him god didn't die amen we are a continuation of the book of acts and whatever they did there they ought to do in the house of god it should be a revival why are people so messed up with somebody having a gift why they get so cranked away somebody having a gift they would hate the book of acts the book of acts men were not afraid of the gifts that god put in their lives they used those gifts come on you keep letting them do it and they won't have one gift left they've already took out the tongues they took out the prophecy they took out the vision they took out the spirit of knowledge and wisdom they took it all out now they're after you preachers you set still long enough and they won't even be a gift of a preacher in a pulpit no more amen but i think it's high time and we lose our fear of these books of devils that's come against the church of the living god pick up your oxnard pick up your bible and fight back for the grace of god for your children for your children's children for your churches for the bride of christ if there ever was an hour to rise up and put a voice against the devil this is your hour i can't help it i'm an american i'm an american i was there with patrick henry when he gave the speech i was there little man said i was you know what he told him he said don't wait till we don't have no guns left don't wait till there's an englishman in every house don't wait until we're to a place that we cannot defend ourselves to decide to get some liberty here you know what they told patrick we'll make a deal with the devil he said how's that worked out for you so far everything you give up they took more let me tell you this you'll never work out a deal with the devil you give him an inch of ground and he'll want to mile tomorrow and if you think you're going to get peace out of giving up something you're sad the devil has fooled you to think if you'll lay down peace will come in the church peace is not going to come as long as there's a devil alive but i think the church of the living god has got an authority and a right today to tell that devil get back in your place satan there's a bloodline it's the word of god and we'll knock back up and we'll not let it go give me liberty or give me death give me liberty give me liberty to preach the word of god to see the dynamics come this is not just another message this is the message of our king that's exactly what happened when jesus come up out of the resurrection and come back into the father's throne he was carrying a vindicated word of resurrection he was the king's message brother brown tells us a powerful story about that david livingstone over in africa don't remember that he was a missionary and he wanted to bring something to them africans but there was always something in the way those tribes that were so much fighting in the tribes amen that if he seemed identified with one or the other he'd get killed before he could ever get the message preached that same devil's living today [Applause] sure you use a good quote on the founders that's wonders that ain't nothing but a scarecrow to keep one of the most powerful sermons you ever heard from your ears see all these tribes but you know what david livingstone did he wanted to deliver a message to those people so he went to the tribe leader to the chief and he made a deal with him and he told him he said we'll exchange something we become blood brothers and remember the tribe chief asked for something amen and david gave of him and when the chief of the tribe said but what do you have david he said i'll tell you what i'll take i'll take your spear because that was a i believe it was a spear amen it was a tribal ceremony spear that all the tribes in the area knew belonged to that king so he said i'll take that and the prophet of god explains and he said what his what his thoughts was is it seemed like he could have greater things but he knew that that would be life to him see see i'm paraphrasing but that would be life to him in other words if he had that spear whenever he come toward a tribe and they started running at him all he had to do was hold up that spear and they would have to back away now there were fierce tribes they could devour a man in a minute and skin him out they were fierce tribes them tribes wasn't tame them tribes wasn't calm or amen they wasn't full of fear but what he had in his hand was greater than what was in their tribes and all you had to do was hold it up and they would recognize he's got the king's message he's representing somebody greater than him now you hear me and today god has put a message in our hands amen that here we are amen in satan's eden and the devil's like a roaring lion he ain't lost none of his power he's as powerful as he ever was but god has put something in your hand he's put something in your hand that satan has to bow every time he hears the name of jesus christ amen i believe today god put something at hand it's the dynamics of the church and the dynamics is the holy spirit case settled dynamics is the holy spirit direct quote case settled hey it's this it's that it's this it's the holy spirit it's god coming into his church filling them in the form of the bride of jesus christ now i'm going to read something familiar to you because i want to get a point out of it and i don't it's not so much just to stay there i want to get a point there now remember this that christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts let's let that pause christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts look at what he says but the book of rights maybe the book of revelation will show how that the antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless can you imagine the temple of god's dynamics powers can you imagine the bride of all the ages powers it's a preacher can it happen you take the dynamics of it in your powers see but the book of revelation shows that how he would try to defile it make it look more formal and powerless it exposes satan the revealing of his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast in the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church now watch the true revelation the true church he just told you he said remember the true church is a continuation of the book of acts if you accept what the prophet said on that then the true church the book of acts amen she'll find out what she is then let me let me just say this and without time to preach these things i just want to make a statement here what she is is pretty powerful what she is if you look back in the scripture she's all that that god thought of in the back part of his mind come on you think of esther is powerful you're greater than esther you think of rahab is powerful you're greater than rahab you think a sheba is powerful you're greater than sheba they were your type you're not theirs they were yours amen they made a type of what was coming in the last days of what god was going to do amen what she is is a powerful thing but what she stands for is a greater power i'll tell you this amen i have come to the place amen where i have decided that i am going to fight for what i stand for [Applause] what i stand for i do not have the time to run down every false doctrine that comes up in that world today there's thousands of them there's thousands of doctrines there's thousands of ways amen but there is something we can stand for and what we can stand for is the message of the hour the way the prophet preached it come on church you cannot separate this bible and that message and never come up with the truth what william branham was preaching was not something outside the bible i get so tired of those dumb questions amen would you take the bible would you take the message what a dumb question what a dumb question like brother branham was preaching something different than the bible he was only explaining what he was reading so it could be broke into revelation to give you an authority concerning the scripture you're reading people run around with these foolish questions it's only to trip you up amen but you got to know what you stand for and you're going to fall for anything i tell you what i stand for is this word of god without fear or without failure i stand for the baptism of the holy ghost as the dynamics in the church the same one that fell in the book of acts has returned again amen as a refilling in the last days i stand for a church that is full of worship i stand for a church with the power of god and sweep into the building and there's somebody alive enough to know that it's happening amen let somebody know that jesus is passing by this way this morning i stand i stand for creation by the word of god i stand that the word of god spoken can change alcohol it can change tobacco problems it can change less problems i believe that the power of god can change lives and ours as it's spoken in power i stand at the idea that one service can change your entire life that's why i stand for the preaching of the gospel of jesus christ not just some reading not just some tape playing but let the anointing of god get a hold of his word and fix things we don't know how to fix situations in lies people are stuck down maybe they got offices they got something going on they can't tell nobody amen but you can't hide it from god you might hide it from a man you can't hide it from god and god will discern that faith while a man's preaching and supernatural words will come out of his mouth and the power of god are usable he might not ever know your name he might not ever know it's you but god has his way just the same and things are exposed in lies by the preaching of the gospel have we forgot that it's written amen by the foolishness of preaching that men might be saved i still believe in letting the power of the holy ghost take a hold of lies and change them i still believe in altar calls i still believe in people praying their way through spirits until they break out into a dimension of life and truth i stand for it i stand for prayer lines where people have been standing there and you put your hands on them it's a preacher why in the world you want a prayer line in this age i was just listening 1964 last night and a prophet standing there with a woman took his wrist watch off laid his hand on the lady and he starts praying for her he said now i'm going to pray you watch my hand he said now look when i lay my hand on you see the vibrations he said that vibrations is a live ulcer in your body he said now you watch my hand while i pray and while the prophet's hand was on the woman he began to pray and she looked up and she said it's gone he said he said now i'm going to take my hand off i'm going to give it to you again and she said it's gone he said do you see by the sign in the hand i could pronounce to you it's gone do you think that that god that did that is somewhere's off in another dimension or another planet but that god is right here in this building this morning for in my name they shall cast out devils they shall heal the sick james 5 and 14 said if there be any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church anoint him live with whole and if they be in his sins let them confess them and they will be forgiven and their bodies will be healed [Applause] so brother wayne i'm scared of that stuff well peter was too when peter was on the water and jesus was standing out there he was afraid of what that was he didn't know what is it if it was god i'd go to it but you know what a little while the voice spoke out of the darkness and said it is i be not afraid you know what that boy said to peter he said come on if you want to walk on the water come on if you want to walk in the impossible come on amen you say well that's amazing do you know that brother branham compared that with exactly james 5 he said it was the word that told peter to walk on that water and it was the word to told you to lay your hands on the sick now i'm not here to look at the circumstances i'm not here to look at the trouble i am here to fulfill the commission of the word of god and god is here to back up the plan that he made for every individual in this building i tell you what i stand for i stand for preaching truth no matter who it appeals don't matter what happens i believe and stand for the idea of preaching truth because it's the truth that'll set you free so brother wayne why are you doing this because brother random said if you would do this and you'd find out who you are and you'd find out what you stand for that you would find that you can do the greater works oh somebody get that devil and set him back up i think he just passed out brother wayne john 14 12 that's just for the prophet what line devil done told you that the bible said he that believeth have i read my bible wrong but he that believeth on me the works that i do shall you do also and greater works and this shall you do for i go unto my father let me put it like this jesus christ is sitting in power this morning and he is our husband and the spirit of him is in the earth his body's there his spirit is here and now we are his body on the earth now what can he do now what part of the gospel can he not perform being that you are the temple of the holy ghost the dynamics of god are you going to limit god just because where he is are you going to limit god just because he's here in the church i'm not going to do it i'm going to take the limits off i'm going to tell you that this bride has an unlimited resource of the power of god oh and she'll recognize this he said well the wayne greater weren't that's scary stuff man well let me just break into that greater works a minute anybody ever heard of a greater meaning of greater works brother brown teaches it he actually tells us that when jesus prophesied that over his own disciples there was only one of him and he knew the gospel would go in the world so for years the translation of that scripture meant that would be more there would be more people doing it so it would be a greater work being done so people all over the world you don't think he didn't know do you you don't think he didn't know we'd be preaching this in the western civilization amen 2 000 years later and he was saying the works that i do shall you do and greater works shall ye do do you see because he did them amen we see his works therefore we do what he did now notice it's a greater work right it's more how many knows the next stage brother bam took that too and he said what happened was he said jesus when he was here was not preaching the baptism of the holy ghost he said so when he said greater works he was saying they would preach something greater than he did preach something greater than jesus that's what he said he said jesus was not preaching the baptism of the holy ghost he said but the disciples were commissioned to do it and by doing so they would impart eternal life [Applause] come on church the preaching the baptism of the holy ghost is not some poli some politics or some pentecostal dogma it's the way of life it's how god comes into his church he was saying brother wayne i don't believe we can impart life i don't know who can or who came but i know what brother branham said he said a son of god can a son of god can do it because he has something in him to project the dynamics that's on the inside let me take you to the let me take you to the day of pentecost amen for the first time amen in two thousand four thousand years when a man was back in authority with god apostle peter standing there with the holy ghost amen they asked him what can we do to be saved he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ with our mission your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and when he said that 3 000 souls were added to the kingdom of god how did they get in the kingdom of eternal life because peter preached the message he preached truth unto him amen you see why i don't understand well let's go to the gentiles house then in the book of acts when peter come to the house of cornelius an angel had been down there talking with cornelius an angel had been discussing cornelius we have seen your arms we have heard your prayers amen but you need to ask peter to come down here and to tell you what's going on brother man said why if an angel was standing there did peter have to go down there he said because life was in the body because life was in that man the life amen the germ of god would be spoken through the words of a man anointed with the holy ghost and while peter yet spake unto cornelius's house they were filled with the holy ghost come on church we are a continuation of the book of acts and i believe right here this morning there may be people who come to this meeting looking for the holy ghost and they're wondering how to get the holy ghost amen but the bible said while he yet spake i believe there's people sitting here right now that you don't have to wait 10 days you don't have to wait 10 minutes i believe while the bible is being preached there's a power coming out of this place at the holy ghost come on you feel the charge of it in the building go ahead and receive it you feel the power of it go ahead and receive it you don't have to wait another day or another hour you don't have to wait until a prayer line or somebody to lay their hands amen christ is here the dynamics of god [Applause] greater works come on there's one more greater meaning to that a prophet of god said very clearly that that greater worst was a spoken word shalom 1964 said that jesus took bread and multiplied to fish and multiplied he said but when moses throwed up the dirt it multiplied he said but when i was out there in the woods the other day i was out there in the woods the other day he said there wasn't no squirrel there there wasn't nothing there but the angel told me about mark 11 chapter why didn't the angel create that squirrel why didn't the angel do the creating because it had come back into the body of jesus christ the very god the very creator of heaven and earth that stood and created the first squirrel was actually being moved into the dynamic power in a mortal man a man born of a woman a man with mistakes a man was sin but a man who had been baptized with the holy ghost and fire had been cleaned up and had become a tabernacle of the deity of god and he could speak the word let there be and there was plum shocks people when you call it a tabernacle of deity them deity people run wild with that didn't they well let me tell you it's the truth if you place it right he said preacher what are you saying i'm saying this is not the prophecy i will be with you this is not emmanuel god did not make a promise in this age i'll be with you he added something to it and said i'll be with you even in you he was he was with a prophet and the prophet was with us but if that's as far as it goes you ain't arrived yet you need another step in the grace of god until the dynamics of god comes into your life with power and authority deity's not in heaven it's in the church of the living god and it's been baptized hallelujah let every devil out of hell say it ain't soul we are right now the sons of god i know they think i'm crazy it's all right i mean i feel pretty good the way i feel but by the way we'll be sons we'll be sons over when we get our body changed true enough true enough fullness of doctrines to change the body i can go there with you but what about first john the third chapter we are now the sons what about ephesians chapter one we have been lifted up in heavenly places in christ jesus come on church you don't think that was every age doing that now do you so brother wayne what do you mean i mean jesus was asked the question can my sons said it's your left hand and your right hand he said no it's not even my position to give for my father in heaven has already assigned it to somebody else and brother brown said those son bodies were the overcomers of the laodicean age there is a place that you have been put in in this hour you have been made an astronaut of god you've been made an eagle of god somebody that can believe every word somebody that can fly higher in any other age you can fly into a realm come on folks we're not being filled with the holy ghost to go back into the ages you're being filled with the holy ghost with the changing of your bodies tell me i'm wrong the lighter glory will be greater than the former glory you know it's you know where that comes from when they were leaving babylon amen under the when babylon switched from babylon to persia and they were leaving the bible said the handwriting come on the wall and only daniel could read it and when the mystery was revealed it was judgment to babylon and the death of their leader but it had another message to those israelites it had another message to them saints it meant the years of their captivity was ended it meant they were being loosed to return to the worship of jerusalem come on they were going to go back and worship under the revelation of who they were born to be as abraham's seed and so has this babylonian age this spiritual age there has been a handwriting on the wall of judgment that's come against it but it has a different message to the ride you know what it means to the bride it means their day of reign is over the devil has done all he can do amen to the pride of jesus christ god has lifted this church above reason and doubt and fear and unbelief and has took us back to the original church in the beginning full of dynamic power full of the promises of god somebody said well if you were you wasn't so if you wasn't so empty you wouldn't be so loud well i'll tell you there's a bride today full they're so full of dynamic power you're hearing sounds of freedom you're hearing sounds of grace you're hearing sounds of authority you're hearing sounds of breakthrough i am tired of those fundamental formal devils coming against the church of the living god i say we ought to release our faith and release the grace of god satan will be powerless before her she will be she will be an invincible army if they get the true revelation of those two spirits these are two spirits brother braham said that spirit was an antichrist spirit which is a religious spirit it was a religious spirit crucified him the first time what do you think it is crucifying this holy ghost today his crucifixion is not coming from a cross it's coming from pulpits crucifying him but the day they do it they are no longer an effective place of worship the spirit of god moves on amen but wherever there are people who will assemble under the power of the blood there is a god that will meet them in that place of worship it's an invincible army that's what they are indestructible they can't be beat invincible means it it's not it's not within their capability of being beat i know people don't understand us i know they don't understand how we're still here but there's nothing in my genetic makeup that says quite i've got the ignore button i've got the i won't listen to you button i've got the i don't want to hear what you got to say button but i don't have the quit button it was not designed in me because before i quit i will change before i quit i've got to have a change in my body don't quit not in these people not in this church not in this bride you see what they'll be able to do they'll be able to withstand i love this wrist stand means to resist it actually means to put up a fight they'll put a fight up with this thing they won't just let the devil come and rob them of everything god gave them they'll put up a fight they'll see it's a religious spirit and they'll put a fight up against it now how do you fight that thing well the man said well just do opposite if you think somebody's mad by them something if you've got a complex do the opposite the hair off the dog's back is good for the bite that's hillbilly ain't it the bad thing is i flat understood what he meant didn't he know in translation for that one for me i'd been dog bit and i knew the only thing help it's a dog hair off its back you say preacher what are you really saying i'm saying that she's invincible [Applause] i'm standing for the fact that she is invincible i'm saying in matthew 24 that the deception will be so great in the last days it would deceive the elect if if possible but according to this message it ain't possible so you know what you tell the devil said go on listen i'm not going to listen to his nonsense i don't have time to fight with the devil i don't have time we've got to preach a message we've got to get people saved we've got to get our lives full of the grace of god so we can change our bodies now this church will stand withstand it will resist and satan will be powerless it will be powerless before her i'm running out of time for him right now message satan will be powerless before her now i think i think brother brother reagan done as good a job last night as i've ever heard someone describing the power of satan in laodicea that was good man sorry it was powerful and what he explained to us all very carefully was satan hasn't lost his power don't you think for a moment you're a match for that devil don't you take this quote run out there and say i'm going to whip the devil no you ain't you're going to get the whip of your life i can point to you amen hundreds of wrecks of people that was that arrogant i can point you to tons of people that thought that very thing amen but it says satan will be powerless before her it doesn't mean he's powerless it means he's powerless before her you say how is he powerless before her listen there's a secret laying brother man says it right here but as he was talking last night that line if you go back to the book of daniel when they told daniel if you don't quit praying and worshiping if you don't quit worshiping your god and worship our god of babylon we're going to put you in a den of lines you know what he did he opened up the windows and said if you don't like that won't you watch this i'm not gonna hide my worship from no devil i'm not gonna hide who i am i am an s238 tongue talking baby full of the baptism of the holy ghost my heart has been filled with resurrection and power the dynamics of the word of god has come into my life i'm not going to shut the curtains and dance behind some some some screen hey man i know you you think you think worshipping on screen's one for you well it's going all over the world right now and all i can say is i hope you like it because if you don't like that why don't you watch this you will not take my praise you will not take my shout you will not take my joy it's all i have it's all i got is my joy my praise the power of this word you can have leo to see you you can have your bars and your dances and your drugs give me jesus give me the power of god oh you don't know like i know not going to pull the curtains i'll hide who i am [Applause] it's who you are that makes you invincible well you're different well thank god you're different thank god you're a different person so go ahead and watch the revelation now tell you what it was daniel didn't hide it and they said just because you wouldn't bow to us we're going to throw you in the dead of lines a lot different lines then then of lines headlines in it you know and the king couldn't deliver him could he he actually told daniel i can't get you out of this daniel but the god you serve the god you serve he'll deliver thee and the doctors might not be able to the doctors might not be able to but the god you serve the god of your fathers the god of abraham he is more than able to deliver thee and i'll not pull the curtains i believe and i believe he's a god over cancer i believe it's a god over every disease i believe he's a god and has a dominion over every devil and every power in the pits of hell i'm not serving a weak god i'm not serving the laodicean god i am serving the god of all the heavens jehovah is his name and he is the god of all miracles the bible records they through daniel in that den and the king didn't sleep all night long he didn't sleep all night long he was worried about what's going on down there with daniel and all the while daniel was sleeping like a baby now lord can you imagine daniel in the lion's den with him dean of lines all swirling around him brother bram said when he stepped down there he backed up in the corner and all of a sudden he felt a tingling over his flesh i guarantee you'll welcome the dynamics in that point [Applause] i guarantee if it's a sensation if it was an eye cry if it was tongues if it was a vision anything god wanted to do at that moment you'd be saying come on lord come on in here the lions are here as a roaring lion he's here to destroy you and the only hope you've got is that the angel of david and the angel of daniel would come in the house of god i don't care if it makes me dance or vibrate or whatever it does just contain the lines [Applause] look what happened in there brother brown said his flesh started tingling he said the line started backing up he said he felt something warm he turned around and looked and he said they're hung that light there hung that light that pillar of fire daniel daniel brought the millennium to babylon it was the millennium but he could lay down with the lines look at this put his head on one line put his feet on another another one snuggled up behind his back until he got real good in cushion if you knew who you are if you only understood what it is that's around you right now king come the next morning he's worried daniel daniel do you live daniel i imagine daniel just held up for a few minutes finally he said okay live forever i prayed remember that thing they didn't want him to do remember that thing they said didn't matter remember the thing that he wouldn't shut off out of his life i prayed and the anointing came the angel came and he delivered me i took that all the way through the bible the other day i won't do it to you tonight amen this morning but i can say with authority that was the angel that crossed the red sea that was the one took down the walls of jericho was right there with daniel and he was able to do it now you would hear that story and you might say to yourselves well then we're just hanging kittens the lions lost their power that's the reason they didn't meet daniel oh but keep reading the next verse it said that the king took daniel's accusers you don't believe in prayer here you go you don't believe in no holy ghost here you go you don't believe in dancing in the spirit here you go the bible said before they hit the ground the lions had already consumed them and had broke their bones let me tell you that lion's got a lot of power but the holy ghost is the power of god and the salvation under authority god always does it you might as well put the devil on warning tonight put him on warning this morning say to him satan you might have tried to feed me to a line but my god is going to feed you to the very line you're trying to feed me to have i got a haman in the building have i got a mordecai in the building haven let me tell you something you keep planning to destroy mordecai but you'll hang on your own gallows call david up and ask him what happened to goliath i cut his head off with his own sword no cancer is not powerless but there's an angel here sickness is not powerless but there's an angel here demons have power but there's an angel here the dynamics is here that's what you're seeing so brother wayne i've been wondering i've been here i saw maybe some people just here for the first time getting among this kind of worship and power and they're saying i wonder what all this is i'll tell you what this is this is that your whole life wondered what that is this is that you like that when it's in the bible but how do you like this i love it brother what is it it's the it's the revival of the bride we've been saying it's coming for years but here it is don't miss it don't miss your opportunity don't miss the greatest days of your life this thing might stop tomorrow they may shut our churches down before next week this may be the last opportunity you ever had to really worship and praise god with other believers to sing your songs to worship your and throw your hands up and rejoice in god amen this may be your last opportunity to do so don't miss it don't let some devil talk you out there some tradition somewhere stanford you're from worshiping god so by wayne i don't know if we'll go to heaven acting like this what do you think we're going to do in heaven we're not going to sit around read the bible in heaven jesus is going to be there i believe i believe right now today i believe this very hour i believe those angels of god is in this building i believe the holy ghost himself is in this building i believe that's the effects that it's having not emotional something causes emotion something's behind the emotion and it's the word of the lord stimulating i i got a thousand scriptures sitting over here at least 500. it'll say the very same it changes things right here this morning while we're while we're here and we're inviting we've opened the curtains let the world see ashamed of this gospel i'm not ashamed to preach it i'm not ashamed to quote it i'm not trying to stand for it says i'll probably give my life for it one day but that's all right with me at least i gave my life for something that was good i don't want to open up my life but i'm the oldest boy out of four none of them lived to be over 31 years old if i didn't leave to be 50 it'd be all right with me but at least i gave my life to something [Applause] something i gave my life to you've got that opportunity right here this morning you have to give your life now there's a there's an enemy spirit that our brother ron has been fighting for months the miracle standing right here we are not we are not going to let that go by by saying it's an accident or coincidence or it's just he wasn't that sick it's like saying them lines wasn't that bad [Music] but it wasn't that bad because the angel was there that cancer is mean it's attacking his his life to to take it prematurely but i believe we need ron spencer i believe we need we're fighting the battle and he's one of the generals in this battle this morning as a group i know we prayed daniel prayed three times a day but while we're here this morning i know it's not possible for every one of you to lay your hands on her brother i know that he's not even allowed to shake hands with you and i know every one of you in this film feel the way i do amen you'd like to gather around him and put your hands on him i i this morning we're going to give you an opportunity to exercise your authority as the greatest force on the face of the earth i'm going to ask you right now drop every difference you have with one another i'm gonna ask you as a family if you're sitting here and there's a little squirmish going on in your home i'm gonna ask you right now drop it let it out of your heart say lord it's not worth it it's not worth it i'm letting it go right now there's been a little bitterness in your life towards someone you've been hurt and afflicted and you've been carrying that thing and it's on your mind all the time i'm i'm compelling you right now drop it let it go these little doctrinal differences and feelings little issues drop it right now just let it go and when you let that go i'm going to ask you if if you will afford me this i'm gonna ask you as a congregation if you agree with me that you're willing to let go of anything in your life you're willing to let it go would you raise your hand with me like this brother wayne i'm gonna let it go this morning i'm gonna turn it loose you promised me you know we'll come pick it back up you're gonna leave it laying right here this morning now with that hand i'm going to use the authority of the scripture a prophet said there was an eternal light inside your body when you were born again it went from a cosmic to an eternal light he said so when a believer puts his hand on someone there is a light that leaves his body and goes into the other i'm going to ask you now as a believer to put your hand upon one another according to mark the 16th chapter in my name shall they cast out devils and shall they heal the sick in james the fifth chapter it said they should anoint them with all and here we are this morning with the scripture we believe the word of god you go ahead and start praying now i'm going to ask you to welcome and awaken jesus this morning we'll not close the curtains [Music] we're not saying that the lines are not powerful but we're saying that there's an angel of deliverance among the church and father we rebuke this thing off of this body [Music] i know that it's a cancer but greater is he that is in us than he that's in this body now satan we curse the life by the authority the word of god is a group of believers we have confessed to our sins we have laid aside our weights that bear us down and we have lifted our hands to a holy god this morning and we are anointing him with whoa now in the name of jesus satan we are jury thee by the power of the living god release mark spencer this morning we curse you by the blood of jesus the very dynamic life of almighty god and life would return strength would return [Music] in the name of jesus [Music] we asked if that angel of light wrong as it delivers my brother this morning we don't care how you come

have a meal prepared for everybody that's here you're welcome to eat with us and fellowship with us we'll be in the fellowship hall and just like we've done the other services if you come down this hall to get back there and ask if we can just let the choir the evening light tabernacle choir go first because we need them back in here pretty quickly to be able to practice [Music] as much as possible amen there's also just really limited seating in that area for the crowd that we have so we have some extra tables set up outside underneath the portico areas around by the youth activity building so different areas to eat once you finish your meal if you don't mind getting up giving that spot to somebody else that needs to eat it will just help with the flow speaking of getting up when you leave today if you can take all your stuff with you makes it really hard to see people when there's bibles and things so just except for a few that are helping with the booths in the back or the music we've tried to not reserve anything we ask you to take your belongings with you or we will try to scoop them all up after the building's emptied uh so come back early if you want a good seat hey man let's sing that song key of f rising up or rising up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
