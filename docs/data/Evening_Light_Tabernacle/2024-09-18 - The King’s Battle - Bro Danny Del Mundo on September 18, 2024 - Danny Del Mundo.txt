Amen to serve God in whatever capacity that they can find or whatever they can do but he's a champion of the message and and we're so thankful for him and his life that he lives and all that he does for the kingdom of God Amen I want to sing that part from from these lips I speak I don't know where it starts amen I want to sing that verse amen so we just want to invite him to come and um Amen to

great amen so in this day and age where there is a great battle we need a great God hallelujah because uh our own skills our own ways would not match the enemy amen but thank God we have a great God hallelujah hallelujah so I bring you greetings from my family my congregation and uh churches that are uh Associated uh with our little Ministry which most of them have met by uh bir Timothy also bir Tim during uh the youth Camp way back when uh they they've been a blessing to our young people and until now amen so we're looking forward that in in the future we will have them once again so God bless you this evening so I pray that uh the Lord will make his way as he always do amen so uh without further Ado I would like to read a portion of the scripture so it's it's really uh hard to think of what to preach especially knowing uh we have a great uh minister of the Gospel message gospel amen and uh we have great respect for uh brother Tim uh his ministry has inspired uh a lot of uh ministers Even in our country and all over the world world so may the Lord uh keep him blessed and healthy all the time Hallelujah till the Lord comes so God bless you let's read our uh starting scriptures this evening in the book of 2 Samuel 2 Samuel 11 verse 1 it says here and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent joab and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besieged Raba but David tarried still at Jerusalem amen so let's read another scripture in the book of Ephesians chapter 6 10 and 11 it says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that she may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places Hallelujah let's bow our heads in prayer dear heavenly father we commit this service into your Mighty hands we commit this words Lord we need you and uh set your servant aside Lord and have your own way speak to each and everyone heart this evening Lord God as we put our full confidence in you Amen in Jesus Christ's wonderful F name and everybody say amen God bless you you may now be seated hallelujah amen so I know this is a very familiar portion of the scripture but what else is uh not familiar with the bride amen because in his mind amen we were in him before the foundation of the world and uh uh it's just a matter of uh bringing us out of our spiritual amnia and that's the very reason we realize we know who we are and uh uh we we believe the Lord has also uh revealed our position in his body amen so in this scripture we see that uh this is David is a man of war from his youth uh youth days and uh all throughout his life he's been fighting battles so he's not uh uh he's not new to battle but at this portion of the scripture amen this is a different kind of War because it says uh in in in verse one it says after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle Yeah amen so we know that in in in wars in in in in many battles amen uh there's certain time and we're so familiar with this that uh uh the Kings or the heads of the state or Nation just stay in their Throne they stay in the palace they stay and they send all their armies to fight the battle and uh believing their strength will uh bring home the victory so the king's just uh waiting in his throne and uh just uh getting some reports updates on what's going on in the field amen but this is a different war in the sense that it says this is the time when even Kings joined the war yeah amen so that David's but uh uh in this situation where where Kings should go for to battle amen David sent joab and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besieged Raba so uh at least they're still winning but they could not have full control of the kingdom of their enemy amen so they're just getting a little little grounds advancing little by little so and that should not be but said is here but David carried still at Jerusalem so he did not join the force amen he stayed in his kingdom he stayed in his Palace and and probably you know knowing David is not he's not a coward King and he was also willing to go to war amen but the the the Bible said David tared amen so if you look at the meaning you know if we we look uh of that verse uh Ted amen it it means to Lodge to stop over pass the night remain or delay amen uh another meaning is to complain so that's the meaning of tar amen so uh so he tared so that means he stayed he was supposed to be in the in the war joining his own Army but he tarried in Jerusalem Hallelujah and so this is where the problem came that's right so he sent his armies and he was just right there uh and the enemy just flooded into the palace yes so now it came now in verse two and it came to pass as in an evening tide that David arose from off his bed and walk upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon amen so maybe David just wanted to he he just delayed this uh uh his interest in going to war and just have to some kind of you know air and he went up and the enemy knew so the main the main thing here is that David was not in his rightful position at that particular time that's right so God always meets us in our post of Duty and the enemy just wants us to be just a little bit just probably an inch that we should be away from our rightful position or our post of Duty and he right there can attack us and this is what we see in this situation that in the evening tide uh uh David so he he rose from the from his bed amen and he saw him he looked down and he saw something down there and then in verse three and David sent an inquired after to the woman and one said is not this B Sheba the daughter of ilam the wife of UAH the he so notice that you know all the demons you know the greatest battle ever for brother bam said the battle is here in the m so that's why that evening I could say that David was not able to have a good sleep because in the morning he was still thinking of what he saw last night amen so then he inquired and who is that woman and David sent and inquired after the woman and one said is not this but shba the daughter of ilam the wife of Uriah the tight amen so just right there David knew that it was not good for him to get a woman married to another man so just right there when when when when the one who answered this inquiry he said the wife isn't he this the wife of Uriah the he amen but you see because David was already already not on his rightful position so now the devil is taking advancing more and more and taking full control amen of David and David was fighting his own battle because he was out of his position amen and so now he didn't stop there and in verse where he said and David sent Messengers and took her and she come in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house and the woman conceived and sent and told David and said I am with child so David did not stop watching David did not stop you know just thinking of that woman amen he asked but he did not stop after he heard that this woman was married even to his own Soldier so he kept amen moving forward and and and and the situation was getting worse and worse worse and worse until that woman amen and and and uh uh uh woman uh that woman conceived amen now there is a result amen of something and now David has to answer for what he did amen but listen in verse six and David sent joab saying Send Me Uriah the heite and joab sent Uriah to David and when Uriah was come unto him David demanded of him how joab did and how the people did and how the war prospered amen so in eight and David said to Uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet and URI departed out of the King's house and there followed him a mess of meat from the King but Uriah slept at the door of the King's house with all the Servants of his Lord and went not down to his house and me I could see how Uriah was so loyal and faithful to his King amen so so David wanted to make a remedy of the situation amen I hope we're going to see that he he asked Uriah to come home and stay with his wife that's right amen because you know in that way David would be able to justify amen the situation right amen it would appear in his kingdom that he did nothing wrong right amen but God did not allow it amen and out of his out of uriah's loyalty he stayed with this King and he said but Uriah slept at the door of the King's house with all the Servants of his Lord and went not down to his house and when they had told David saying Uriah went not down to his house David said unto Uriah CEST thou not from thy Journey why then did thou not go down unto thine house so as if David was concerned to you IAH amen why don't you miss your wife you've been in the war all along amen and you did not even see your own wife amen so hypocrisies coming in just a little space that David gave to the demon now the situation was getting worse and David said to youah I here today and tomorrow we let thou depart so you UAH AB in Jerusalem that day and the tomorrow and when David had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and at even he went out to Lion his bed with the Servants of his Lord but went not down to his house and it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah and he wrote in the letter saying set you Uriah in the Forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die and it came to pass when joah observed the city that he as anuah into a place where he knew that Valiant men were amen so we're not new in this portion of the scripture we know what have happened David wanted so from that little out of his post of Duty his situation seems to be out of Remedy that's right and the more he wanted to make things right the more he wanted to uh uh to to make that error that Sin appear to be nothing the more he is at the brink of being exposed Hallelujah so uh he wanted to justify and later on he he became hypocrite and then later on he want he committed a murder amen right now we're living in the day and age it's like we said this is the King's battle because everything is coming into full maturity denominations are coming into full maturity politics are coming into the its full maturity brother bam said politics is rotten to the core amen your uh presidential uh your presidential uh election is coming amen and uh I made the statement one time you know just just like you know whatever happens in your election amen it it is coming to a fulfillment of the prophecy if the if Cala wins then the prophecy of having a literal woman president will be fulfilled and if Donald wins then it must be the last Trump so nothing is left in this generation amen so everything is coming Amen to maturity but let me tell you this evening if politics is going into maturity denominations are coming into maturity there is also one that is coming into full maturity and that is the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen we're come we have come into that into that point where we realize who we are amen and what the Lord is doing in our generation amen we have come we have access Amen to everything that God has promised in this generation and the only thing that we do is just believe amen that what he had accomplished is is already made available in this generation Hallelujah so now uh I remember uh brother timoth is preaching right there in in uh in Virginia and and and uh uh he he preached about being certain in this uncertain time amen so we we're living Amen in in this age where everything is uncertain everything is you know uh uh uh you know even people people today are being confused even in their own gender amen so but there's a group PE of people that is so certain because the Lord has given us a message in this generation and the prophet of God said they men all along in Through the Ages God has predestinated a certain group of people Amen to recognize the day that they're living amen and and and thank God we're part of it now in the message the greatest battle ever fought and brother bham said the great hour of church is at hand that was in 1962 it was at hand there amen but let me tell you it's here now amen so the great hour of church charge is at hand soldier with armors gleaming colors Streaming Faith and doubt is setting yourself in array in this Tabernacle this morning he said doubt on one side faith on the other soldiers and at your post of Duty hallelujah our captain the Morning Star leads on he never goes back he never don't know the word Retreat he doesn't have to retreat amen certainly he said so he said the greatest battle ever fought she is going on he's right in here now she is going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt oh my between Liberty and bondage the battle is on Shine Your spear soldiers Palace up the armor God is getting his soldiers ready amen God anoints his army amen so we can we can only live by the kind of anointing we have amen we can only live by the kind of inspiration we have we cannot go beyond that Hallelujah and so now in this in this day and age we're living in this uh uh age where you know the uh uh uh the religious spirit amen the the uh all this you know in this age of uh uh lukewarmness amen is creeping not only in the denomination real but also creeping in into the circles of the message movement hallelujah amen so now uh uh uh we have come also to the point amen that Jud says in this message have come out amen people who who declared they believe the sign but now they disbelieve the sign already and trying to fight it trying to to refute everything trying to discredit the prophet discredit all the testimonies amen but let me tell you they're too late hallelujah it's been too late already Hallelujah and I'm thinking of Rebecca amen thinking of Rebecca when when she met elizer and and and and uh uh elizar described Isaac and and and even without physically seeing each other but because amen H uh uh Rebecca had an experience and she believed the messenger the one that was being sent by Abraham knowing Isaac very well amen he he he was able to present amen Isaac as if he's just right there amen she just believe what the messenger said amen and no one sto her amen so uh now you think when when Isaac and Rebecca got married and somebody will say oh that eliser is a false messenger what will Rebecca say you're too late I'm already married to Isaac I'm already won with Isaac you're too late amen hallelujah before me amen so now I have all these things and also we have come amen even our technology is has come you know we have this AI amen uh uh uh by by by by by its uh title itself it speaks for itself artificial intelligence amen so where will it bring you amen it ends in everything that is altif artificial that's but thank God we have our own AIS we have Almighty intelligence amen that is before the foundation of the world Amen so now everything so now let's see uh after all these things now David he had everything he had position he had wealth and uh uh he had power but David despite of all these things he come to a point when he was out of his position he lost something so that's why when we think of that song that he wrote in Psalm 51: 1-3 when he said to the chief musician the psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came unto him after he had gone into BBA have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blout out my transgressions amen so and eventually later on we will see in verse 10 David said create in me a clean heart oh God and renew do a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit Hallelujah we may have all the information of this message the message is searchable wherever you go you go online you can search you want to look for something amen and you can get any information regarding this message of of the hour Hallelujah but you come to church with long face amen you come to church without Joy amen because there is something wrong somewhere hallelujah amen so the reason why people could not express themselves amen the Bible said here amen restore unto me the joy of thy salvation amen David David knew he was a man after God's Own Heart David knew that God will not give him up but somewhere in his heart he didn't feel the joy he had no pre spirit amen before you know when he sit down and and and and and you know touch uh his heart and all the demons are being driven out but now the demons are no longer afraid yeah right because the demons knew that David was out of his position amen so when he wrote this song in verse one he made mention why he wrote that song he knew he was out of his position but now thank God Amen so uh uh you see God is only waiting for something and God always correct the error amen by sending being a messenger Hallelujah the prophet of God what happened to David amen it can happen to anyone amen it can it can happen he said David was a man after God's Own Heart and when David sinned before God God made David reap for what he sold and will never come short of that how many believes you're son of daughter of God this evening amen amen we are not excused said what happened to David when he was out of his position amen you we we saw what happened and brother bam said it can happen to anyone whether it's an individual whether it's a church whether it's a community or a nation God will require Judgment of sin yeah hallelujah amen so that's why when God calls us for a certain position to do to accomplish something we better get there right away and we should not miss any opportunity and then we give our best Hallelujah and so now all all these things have happened but but you see he started with little thing and in Ephesian Church age let me read this he said now the very name Ephesus as a strange compound meaning aimed at and relax yeah the high aspirations of this age had begun with the very name Ephesus and fullness of this or began with the fullness of the spirit the depth of God whereby they were aiming at the High Calling of God began to give way to a less watchful attitude a less Ardent following of Jesus Christ begin to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called The Church would sink to an openness of the depth of Satan it become relaxed and was drifting already the age was backsliding it had left its first love the tiny seed planted in that Ephesian age would one day grow in the spirit of error until the foul birds of the air would rose in its branches so in offensive to human reasoning would that little plant appear to that new EVE the new church that again she would be deceived by Satan the Ephesian AE had presented to her the opportunity for God's best and for a while she prevailed and then relaxed and in that unguarded moment Satan planted the seed of complete ruination just from a little relaxation that's right amen just missing a simple opportunity everything was lost amen so every time so I remember uh you know in in our country during during World War II uh uh there was a US general named macartur is General macartur I don't know if there is their veterans here we appreciate uh so during World War II when our country was uh being concered by Japanese Imperial Army and the the war was getting harder and harder and and and there was an order for General marur to leave the Philippines at the peak of the war he had to leave the Philippines in order to support Australia during that time I'm not mistaken in 1942 and uh during that time while he was leaving his heart was broken but he had to follow order but he made a statement and he very popular in the Philippines that he said but he said I shall return amen so if you say that even in the young student in the Philippines I shall return it is a tou with General MacArthur so in 1942 and then he supported the war in Australia and then after 3 years in 1945 amen General marur went back to the Philippines and he made an announcement and not not shall I shall return and he said I have returned burn and in 1945 amen the the city of Manila the the entire Philippines was being taken back amen but and so in in in in in one of the provinces where where General marur first landed that's in Tacloban late and then they have this place and they built monuments you have their General macartur going down to the ship and that reminds and in that Monument there is a portion of our former president that said amen now it is good amen it we we we appreciate I'm just repacing it uh uh General marur fulfilled in this spot his promised to the Filipino people to return indeed General macartur have returned fulfilling his promise but at the L part he said amen but during the three years amen of bitterest fighting amen our former president appreciated the Filipino guilia and the American soldiers because during those three years of serious battle amen this Filipino guilia and US soldiers amen they were not afraid the Death March and all these things amen everything happened but they did not give up they fought for the span of three years now why am why why why am I saying this brothers and SS we we have come to the point where in the ending portion of this age where everything amen uh uh uh is fulfilled in our generation but we thank God Amen that during the time when this message when the when when when uh the word is being revealed the book are being the Mysteries are being opened and we have come to the point amen that the the ending portion of this generation but we thank the Lord because in between that's right there are warriors of this message that kept fighting Hallelujah they did not give up amen the old Warriors remain Hallelujah to fight the battle never changing amen never giving up still keeping the battle Hallelujah and we appreciate Hallelujah B te for keeping the battle amen we we're in the coffee shop this morning I said brother Tim amen you look so good I said you look good what did you say he said can you repeat that again I did not just repeat I said brother Tim you look so great today and then brother Timothy came and he said brother Danny can you repeat so brother Timothy can can hear it again let me repeat that once again you look so great brother B te and we appreciate amen hallelujah Warriors who keep the fight until the end Hallelujah so this amen these soldiers amen the Filipino soldiers and the uh American soldiers amen they they you know most of them you know you can see uh uh the War uh War turn uh Philippines and you could see how Filipino and Americans spot together amen and uh uh the Philippines was was was being given back to us amen but of course we love Japanese also now because we have work going on in in Japan amen so pray for the work in Japan we appreciate what you're doing amen the the work's going on the translation is going on Amen and uh it's always good to have somebody amen it's always good to have somebody on your side at your back and uh uh I always uh I am I'm I'm always working for a team as a team I I I'm a team person Hallelujah because I cannot uh do everything but we we trust the Lord for everything so it says here in we we we try in Ephesian AG had presented to her the opportunity for God's best and for a while she prevailed and then relaxed and in that unguarded moment Satan planted the seed of complete ruination Hallelujah so but we see we're fighting the same devil amen now what brought back David is the same thing that will bring us back amen that we should always be on guard amen you may be a musician you may be a deacon trusty in the church or you may be just sitting there you're not just a visitor but you are part of the body we have a portion to accomplish Hallelujah remember the time you know you know it when you go to church you have your I don't know but you have your seats uh maybe some of you have favorite seats amen and just remember during the time when you are on your seat Hallelujah we have our position we have our rightful post of Duty amen and so now you see now let's move forward in 2 Samuel chapter 12 and the Lord sent Nathan unto David let's proceed to verse five and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord leaveth the man that had done this thing shall surely die you know what Nathan said it he she he made a parable you know David what can you say Amen uh there is somebody there's a family very poor family and then uh H uh that they have uh this little thing a lamb amen but somebody who so powerful took the lamp amen and David was mad amen and he said the man that had done this thing shall surely die amen and that was him you know this is something that's why we see even for a man after God's Own Heart when he is so overpowered by the multitudes of devils he can manifest a life that should not be manifested so a pull pleds hypocrite right in front but that's the purpose of the prophet Amen to shake him up amen and so all these things we we we have we fully know this the rest of the story amen and in verse 12 for thou did it secretly but I will this do this thing before all Israel and before the son and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also ha put away thy sin Thou shalt not die amen we know that David was not was was was forgiven but thank God in this generation we're not just forgiven we're Justified as if he have we have not done it in the first place because the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ still works today Hallelujah it has power in it it's been 2,000 years ago amen where where where his blood was dropped at the at in Calvary but it remains powerful until now there is always room at the cross amen when anyone amen anyone who wants to go back amen H H there is always a way amen and and and this is something that was not given to others amen that's right I remember Sarah and the wife of lot if we balance what they did Sarah made worse act against God he made God a liar he didn't she didn't trust God Amen but M Lord just look back yeah amen but there is something different with them because God had a covenant with Abraham but to lot there was none Hallelujah whatever they say you know some people when you say about predestination you know we we we do Mystery Exposition we share this message to the denominational ministers and it's earning good just recently amen we were uh we were able to uh we were able to baptize three pastors let me just tell you a little story amen There Was You know I have been uh praying for uh I work in South Korea and I said Lord if you want me to be involved in the work in South Korea please Lord give me a new ground just like what you did in Japan just like what you did in Indonesia amen please amen so I've been I've been praying for years amen covid came and nothing is still it's been years lingering in my heart amen something has been started in Japan already they have a pastor there uh in in Indonesia we started uh I started uh uh uh working with three pastors one in Depo one in Jakarta one in Medan amen but two months ago amen me and my wife visited Indonesia because uh after after the covid I was we were not able to go back there and when we came back amen we're so glad amen we we have uh at least close to 30 churches now in Indonesia for God's glory amen hallelujah it is not man's doing it is God's doing so I said Lord if you want me to be involved please give me an open door let it be a new ground and so now there is a brother a a minister that was sent by the denomination in South Korea and during covid he was given missionary uh uh missionary visa for 2 years and when he he was given his wife went there but 6 months when they started doing M Ministry in in South Korea covid came and so they could not go to church so now during this time they come across with our uh streaming in in in and and they watch our services and so this brother uh uh tried to reach us and said we are they are interested in the message and he had two close friends still in the Philippines pastoring denominational churches in the Philippines and he made mention watch this watch this and they all together watch our uh uh services in this in the Church online and then to have the story short this brother came back to the Philippines after covid and the first thing that he did he brought his wife brought his three sons to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ along also previous to that the two other ministers came amen and they received and one of the two brothers he embraced the message so much he brought us to his church he brought us to his outreaches amen and now they are fully embracing the message baptize baptizing their people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now this brother in South Korea he said brother uh brother Danny we're going back to South Korea and please amen uh H uh uh we're praying that you can come over there and that's also my prayer yeah so I believe now this is the Lord's I thought this is the Lord's way amen and so okay let's plan and everything and now during the time of April and May uh our our communication stopped a little bit and I was wondering and sometime in June he called me said pastor Danny I'm here in the Philippines you know what happened he was kicked out by the denomination because he got so excited and shared this message and uh now you you take a break first and we are able to give you two more years uh missionary Visa provided you stop sharing this message that you are telling our people amen and I said what about my prayer Lord amen but you know what the Lord opened a new door Hallelujah One South Korean uh uh uh brother tried to reach us amen and Lord willing we have set a schedule Amen in November second week of November we're going to start a work in South Korea for God's glory amen so he the same amen so now so you see we we we're doing uh all these things and we just have to stay in our post of Duty sometimes we think of something so I'm thinking this is the brother that that the Lord will be using amen but look what have happened amen so I said amen H and he said I I still want to get that uh uh 2year missionary Visa but I will still preach the message I said you cannot do that amen because brother Bram said we need to be honest in everything that we do and by our honesty you know God will provide a way and here is the way this is God's way we have many outreaches in the Philippines if you in desire Ministry you can help in the ministry at least you're still in the Philippines with your family and now he he he followed my advice and he's working helping with us now going back to our subject now amen so you see David was out of his place yeah and so the demons amen number one he was now fighting his own battle number two he wanted to remedy The Situation Number Three the situation get worse amen and number four amen he committed a crime it was a premeditated murder that have happened Hallelujah but now how could how how how could he uh uh correct the things all this mess that he was in there's nothing he could do amen but he got the password and that password was to repent and say Lord I have sinned against you he went down and commit everything unto the Lord and now it's the the Lord making it right for his glory we do not in any way justify what David did I just want to drive my point here amen that after the thing was being corrected and David went back to what he was supposed to do amen you know uh what have happened you know David then uh went to war and in that war in no time he said in in in in uh in 2 Samuel 12: 29 he said now and David after he repented after the Lord has made everything amen correct amen and David gathered all the people together and went to rabba and fought against it and took it it was so fast right amen so when when he realized and he accepted that he committed an error he committed a serious offense against God he transgressed amen the word of God and he realized he was out of his position but when that thing was corrected already now he he he uh he wore his his battle robe amen and and took his Chariot and went to war in verse 29 and David gathered all the people together and went to rabba and fought against it that should be his position that's Hallelujah so our position should be should always be in the battle when we receive this message brother bam said we're not going on a holiday we're going on a war we are an enlisted Army of the Living God hallelujah and remember the battle is serious amen we have come to the point amen that the batt is so serious because everything goes so matur this in this is the age where we hear that people when something happen when a disaster happened amen there is a similar statement that people always use they say oh we didn't see this happen before yeah why because every disaster is going worse and worse Amen in politics oh we didn't see it happened before amen hallelujah in our problems in the challenges that we fight oh we didn't see this happen we never expected this come our way Hallelujah but think of the greatest enemy greatest challenge greatest struggle this evening think of the worst sickness this evening let me tell you God is able because the king Hallelujah this is not your battle he said this is not your battle this battle is mine and thank God we are on The Winning Side Hallelujah and so now he said now David gathered all the people he's no longer in his spiritual Amnesia amen and he didn't want to T again he immediately said God he gathered all the people together and went to rabba and fought against it and took it and immediately invery and he took their king's crown Hallelujah he got the king's crown from off his head the way there up was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set on David's head and he brought for the spoil of the city in great abundance amen so when everything was right what what makes it right number one he realized his position he should be in the war yeah Hallelujah he should be in the war and he fought the War and he overcome it Hallelujah but you know in Revelation chter 9:1 they had a king over them which is the Angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is abadon but in the Greek tongue had his name apolon Hallelujah this is another Revelation 9911 amen that the enemy the king amen hallelujah so that's why brother bam made mention in this generation about about a rider in the P seal he said notice this Rider is nothing but Satan's Superman an incarnate devil his educated genius now I hope you got your ears open they were trying one of his children out not long ago in television cast to see if it wasn't smarter than the next manth to run for presidency but however he's got a lot of wisdom so has Satan so Satan has Superman in this age amen but if we a Superman we have a supernatural God hallelujah we have a supernatural God we just have to realize where we should be in our rightful position amen before I read few more scriptures I just want to relate this portion in the Book of Judges how important our rightful position is notice in Judges chapter 20 in verse 12 he said and the tribes of Israel sent through men through all the Tribe of Benjamin saying what wickedness is this that is done among you now therefore Deliver Us the men the children of billar bad which are in GI that we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel but the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their Brethren the children of Israel but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the Cities unto gbea to go out to battle against the children of Israel and the children of Benjamin were numbered at the time out of the Cities 20 and 6,000 men that Drew sword beside the inhabitants of GI which were numbered 700 chos men among all these people there were 700 chosen men left-handed everyone could sling stones at un hair breath and not miss and the men of Israel beside Benjamin were numbered 400,000 men that Drew sword and these were Men of War 18 and the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God and asked counsel of God and said which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin and the Lord said Judah shall go up first before going to war they seek the counsel of the Lord they even asked God how we should place our soldiers who shall go up first and God said Judah shall go up first and the children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamp against GI and the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin and the men of Israel put themselves in a ray to fight against them at Gea and the children of Benjamin came forth out of GI and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day 202,000 men now listen they did the right thing they knew they're going to war they knew they had to seek the Council of God if they are going to fight and God said go fight how are we going to arrange our soldiers our army who shall go first God said Judah shall come first so they obeyed every counsel of God and they had this full confidence that they're going to win the battle because they got God's word but it happened the other way around because on the first day they were destroyed down to the ground ground of the Israelites that day 20 and 2,000 men how would you react others would say Lord we ask you Lord we seek your will Lord we prayed we open OB even obeyed how we will arrange the Army amen but said but we lost 22,000 men thousands of women thousands of mother lose their sons thousands of widows happened after obeying your will Lord amen but they did not do it instead in verse 22 and the people of the men Israel encouraged themselves and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in Array the first day and the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until even and asked councel of the Lord saying shall I go up again the battle against the children of Benjamin my brother and the Lord said go up against him and the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day and Benjamin went forth against the Mount of gbea the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again 18,000 men all this drew the sword twice seeking God's will will going to church amen attending even prayer meeting seeking God's counsel obeying God's word amen and yet losing look look at this 40,000 men in two days but they did not turn their back against God hallelujah butam said it doesn't matter what situation we have it's not the circumstances around us but it is our reaction on the things that's going on Amen don't question God simply because things are not going the way we are expecting amen as long as we know Lord this is your will Lord this is your advice Lord this is your message amen we will stay with it hallelujah amen 40,000 men along the way amen Maybe you know uh people you you you you're fighting you're fighting together shoulder Tosh shoulder and then you're losing them along the way and yet God will not allow that without a purpose amen because only in those situation where we will we realize amen all things work together for good amen because we love God Amen we realize amen that nothing happened by accident and so on the third day amen and Benjamin went forth and said in verse 26 then all the children of Israel and all the people went up and come unto the house of God and wept and sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until even and offered bur offerings and peace offerings before the Lord they never change the way they worship God Amen they still WEP they still approach God Amen they still go to the temple and seek the counsel of the Lord Lord shall we go up to battle Lord shall we still fight yeah amen hallelujah amen God said Hallelujah go to fight amen how shall we arrange our army shall we change because there are many uh Poland soldiers of Judah amen never mind H Allelujah let Judah Pur stay in your position stay as the way it was given on the first day on the second day stay where you are amen for tomorrow I'm going to give you the battle you're going to be victorious Hallelujah in the end they become Victorious because they stayed in the rightful position Hallelujah maybe your prayer is not answered day one it's not answered Amen in a month maybe it's not answered it doesn't matter but God said he accomplished that already by his stripes we were healed hallelujah it's just a matter of keeping up our position our post of Duty and wait when God gives his answer Hallelujah God is never a liar God is true to his word and we can always take God at his word hallelujah and so on the third day after losing 40,000 men hallelujah what is 40,000 men but they had The Sweetest Victory on the third day because they stayed in the rightful position that's the same thing Hallelujah so if they changed their mind they could have lost amen so now in this generation we're fighting again and so Satan has raised up amen amen he's riding he said in in the port B is riding this God's Satan Superman is you know but I have good news for you if God if if he if if if Satan uh has his Superman amen we have also our Supernatural God as I said Hallelujah who is fighting the battle for us amen hallelujah so now that happened to David but thank God we have the son of David amen of course we believe that he will be the son of David Amen in uh uh uh after the Rapture in the in in the millennial Reign amen but 2,000 years ago amen this the same he said you know he was he was the rejected King 2,000 years ago amen but he never Chang he fought his battle to bring the victory for us hallelujah 2,000 years ago he was just right there at the at the uh uh at the door of death yes and he proved he was the king so 2,000 years ago he came down the King of Kings the Lord of lords came down to fight the battle for us to fight death amen amen and he went down even to hell that's right just like David going to the Kings amen and two took that king's crown and brought home the victory that's right now we have our son of David 2,000 years ago and I like this story amen I I'm I'm always repeating this illustration by Brother Brenham in the message perfecting his church he said now the Romans said that's the Son of God the Earth builts out in TRS it's the Son of God and now he is here to the lost souls and he knocks on the door brother bam knocks on the pull pit several times I can hear him when his majesty when he knocks on the door and they looked up at him he said I am the Son of God I've just died at Calvary for Sinners why did you believe Enoch and the rest of the prophets before the day of Destruction he had to witness to the lost that he was the son of God and them screaming for Mercy he had to shut the door CU they had spurn mercy and they had to receive judgment and he goes on down a past the demons I can see him go down to Hell where the dev was amen he entered into the real right there at the Throne of Satan amen inel and he said now knock at the door the devil said who is there said open up and I can see the devil open up the door oh he said you finally arrived did you I finally got my hands on you he said I thought I had you when I killed Abel I thought I had you when I took the life of the prophets I was sure I had you and I behead the John but now I've got you amen I can hear him as he rattles the scary key there of hell and Death on his side the keys that kept people shut up in for all those years he rattled it Jesus said I am the Son of God I am the Virgin born son of the Living God you can blop people any you can't blop people any longer my blood still wet at the cross I paid the pull price Hallelujah pull price not partial he paid the full price amen of everyone of them Sinners and now they're free give me that key of death and Hell remember when he raised up he had he had it yes sir give me that key you'll not scare them anymore my people will not be scared that believes on me anymore and I can see him Smite the devil in the face and pulled the keys and hang it on his side and start to Glory he start for the heavens and me in another message brother bam said uh the Lord turn around and give him a healthy cake amen and and and took the key amen and and give him a healthy kick and slam the door amen and he said from now on I am the boss now and he said I can see him he said wait a minute there's another group over here had been job Abraham Isaac Sarah why Heaven wouldn't be heaven without Sarah and Abraham in it hardly there they were over here in Paradise they couldn't go in the presence of the father they lived under the burn sacrifice all they knew how to do they were Justified but it couldn't divorce sin it could take sin amen it happened before amen by the Bloods of goats and Bulls of animals amen but how much more it is the blood of the son of the Living God the Lamb of God that takes away all the sins of the world we have him Hallelujah and so now amen he went down there don't get me wrong but I can say you know that the first Revival happened in hell when the king went down there and took the keys of death and one by one the doors open now you take yourself they've been bound in Hadis amen everyone that di they were they were there waiting for the coming King waiting for somebody to lose them because that's not their place they should be under the altar of the Lord amen and so when he came down there Hallelujah he called Abraham he called Sarah he called job he he called everyone of them Hallelujah and what would you feel and I could feel how amen when job saw amen that when he said that hundreds or thousands of years ago he said I know my redeemer leave it and now job was right there this is my redeemer he's really alive he came down to pick me up you think job will not jump you think job will will just sit down right there when he realized his own Redeemer came down to get him and put him under the altar hallelujah amen hallelujah so don't get me wrong when I say that because I mean something have happened happened and not only that you know 2 thou or or 6,000 years ago through the serpent Amen in God's Eden Satan took the woman that's in God's Eden amen but nothing happens by accident God permitted that to happen to show his power that he's able to bring everything back in its rightful position Hallelujah so let it go and let Satan and for the span of 6,000 years amen from the time in the Garden of Eden where the woman the men fell Hallelujah 6,000 years and all through those years until now Amen brother Brandon preached amen about and and he described amen this is Satan's Eden the prophet declared that this world has far become Satan's Eden but it happened for a purpose so that what happened in the garden of God where Satan took the woman now after 6,000 years of of establishing his kingdom here on Earth to make this Satan's Eden once again Hallelujah he came with his full power amen I remember brother brandham when he was just right there Amen in the mountain and when he raised his hand something fell into his hand and he felt something and he said it's not aching sword yes it's the king sword hallelujah it's the king sword and now that same King sword is in the hand of the Bride which is the revealed word of the hour Hallelujah it fits very well in our hand but you see I like what brother brandham said and probably I'm closing in this portion I like when brother bham said when he mentioned that he said now I was standing there in prayer and something happened and now something fell in my hand now I know if you don't understand spiritual things it may seem very strange but something struck in my hand when I looked it was a sword and the handle was made of pearl the prettiest Pearl I ever seen and the guard I guess it's keep you hands your hands from being Lance you know while you're the people were dwelling was gold and the same ne's blade wasn't too long but it was just razor sharp and it was glistening silver and it was the prettiest thing I ever seen it just pit my hand exactly and I was holding it I said isn't that pretty I look at it and I thought but you know I always afraid of a sword I was kind of glad that he lived out of the days that they used them because I'm afraid of a knife what would I do with that and while holding it my hand in my hand a voice from somewhere said that is the King's sword and then it left me I wondered what it meant this that is the king sword and I thought if would have said a king sword it might have been that I would have understood it but it said the king sword so my I may not have this right but I thought there's only one the king that's God and his sword is this sharper than a two-edged sword he abide in me and my words you see and he said now in the last part said I don't understand one word of it but or one principle of jewelling but the best of my understanding the knife striking across and then finally the swords if they lock the enemy and you lock the swords like this then it takes the Str strength of the man jeweling because his sword would be pointed to my heart and mind to this but they locked as are knives striking each other and then they strike and then the swords come together and the the one that can shove the other one down the sword straight to the heart and let me close with this statement and he said so it takes even though the sword be the word it takes the hand of strong faith to hold it there to bring it to the heart of the enemy Hallelujah we have the sword we have the word we have the promise 2,000 years ago he accomplished what he had to do that's right and this is not just a story this is a reality if it happened 2,000 years ago and he's the same yesterday today and forever he is going to do what he had done 2,000 years ago it's here it's available but it takes the hand right of somebody who say he believes amen and it takes yeah there's no question about the word but how about the hand that holds it amen it has and it should have enough Faith to struck Into the Heart of the enemy Hallelujah and say Satan you are defeated yes and as brother Ron spener always say boo devil Hallelujah aren't you glad this evening we have the revealed word of the hour we have the manifestation amen We Believe Hallelujah that what he had done before amen is the same thing that he's doing today hallelujah thank God for the revealed word of the hour hallelujah thank God that when he went down amen 2,000 years ago the enemy has been defeated already we're fighting a defeated enemy Hallelujah we are standing on the side of a Victorious King who came down not just on Earth 2,000 years ago he came down to Hell Hallelujah so that those Souls that were in prison amen were being released they were being liberated and they were you know uhh went went back amen and and and and that uh uh there were tombs that were opened after his resurrection and within the span of 40 days people have seen them Hallelujah before amen before they they they came up came up up again amen and the King's Highway was opened open ye gates because the king is coming along with the Saints of the Old Testament Hallelujah they have done their part they have done their portion but once again we're fighting a battle that had been won already you are on the side of a Victorious King Hallelujah we have reason to Rejoice hallelujah amen and so if in if in hell those those Believers in the Old Testament under the blood of bulls and goats were rejoicing when they saw the king how much more today brothers and sisters amen so God bless you amen keep on praying for brother Dany I miss my wife I miss my family very much I have to cut my trip short
