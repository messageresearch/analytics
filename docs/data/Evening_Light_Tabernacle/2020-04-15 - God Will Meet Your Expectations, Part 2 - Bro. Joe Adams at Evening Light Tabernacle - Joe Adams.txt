set our wings in the winds of faith father we just bow before your throne tonight we want to say thank you lord thank you for yet again securing us protecting us guiding us and leading us Lord through the many challenges and places that we face in this journey god I just ask tonight that you will you would take the words that are be spoken and you will bless it to the heart into the ears that it'll fall upon tonight whether it be those here in the local assembly or those out on the way of the internet Facebook livestream but I'm asking you you'll just take the message tonight and bless your people with it take your servant Lord God allow me to get myself out of the way and do my part trusting that you will move tonight father trusting Lord you would say something that would encourage the people Lord that elevate their faith tonight to believe and as brother Timothy spoke last winsy uncertain times we can be certain that you're a Living God so we're asking tonight that you move Lord in every heart in every home with every need God until you will bring us back all together of your recorded time of you just be with us as we do these livestream services bless our musicians that come

a hedge of protection a lord of a wall of fire around each other sword as we go out myself and end of the hospital daily Lord protect us father now maybe we just set our wings tonight in the winds of faith in your word we just ask it your blessings will preside over this meeting tonight in Jesus name Amen if you have your Bibles tonight we're gonna look here in first Corinthians chapter 2 you love the Lord tonight amen just want to share something I had spoken several several weeks back to our young people in the message that I'd called God will meet your expectations and tonight I want to carry that on I know we haven't had any youth meetings but we're here tonight when brother Timothy had called me and asked me if I would take the service this was the first thought that came to my heart and I just felt that this is exactly what the Lord wants us to hear in this certain time that we're living in with the conditions or around us that we're being inundated with I want to speak tonight on God will meet your expectations part 2 and we look here in first Corinthians 2 and verse 9 the Bible says but as it is written eye has not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them that love him think about that your eye has not seen your ear has never heard and it's never even perceived in the heart of man the things that God have in store for us and we look here in Ephesians 3 and verse 20 and this is what we're going to draw our context tonight now into him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that word power there is Dunamis according to the power that worketh in us unto Him be glory in the church notice now unto Him be glory we're in the church by Jesus Christ are by Christ Jesus throughout all the ages without end amen you can be seated tonight we just pray the Lord will bless the reading of his word and we just want to continue to lift those up in prayer brother Ron brother Jul brother Mickey brother Vernon sister Shalom many other ones that are shut-in and just trust God I have the preeminence and I've trusted your streaming tonight and you'll be encouraged this word exceeding abundantly here means a super abundant super abundant in quantity are superior in quality exceeding abundantly above more more abundant advanced it's exceedingly very high beyond measure now we're finite people we measure things by whether it be a ruler or yardstick or maybe by money whether it be by success whether it be by this out on the other but yet God is saying it's beyond measure you can't even measure what God has in store for the believer it's more superfluous it's supremely much more than all more plainly superior extraordinary surpassing and it's uncommon aren't you glad to be a believer because your benefits are uncommon to this world because God pours it out on you it means preeminence superiority advantage more imminent more remarkable more excellent I'm so glad to be a child of God to know that God said that he will do exceeding abundantly above all that I can ask all that I can think according to the Dunamis power that were pedina Mystere means the power to perform miracles it's the power is strength it's violence it's mighty it's wonderful oh let me tell you God there's a power that lays in a believer tonight because we're not resting on their own ability they're not resting on their own merits they're resting on what God has done for them he saved him he redeemed him there was an Easter that resurrected in their life and now they serve a living God and because their trust is not in their own selves for the sin that God God says I will do exceedingly for you tonight I will do more abundantly for you tonight I will do more superfluous for you tonight you got a need tonight I'm the God that I meet that need you got a desire on your heart tonight I'm God Elohim el Shelly on the breast of God tonight and he's here to meet that need whether you're in the service tonight her on the stream on the other end God is still God and he's able tonight and he's willing tonight and he's here tonight service at the sir he's ready to meet the need and his expectations other believers do you believe that now let's just think about this think about your greatest thought brother George your greatest Epiphany your greatest thought the thing that you imagine sometimes we imagine being up maybe a character in the Bible or maybe sometimes we imagine being super rich I don't know what your imaginations are but we can think we can imagine we can just think about the blessings what it would be like to walk on the streets of gold and different things of that nature and your greatest imagination your greatest understanding of God God says right here in this one scripture he will go beyond human perception he will go beyond human descriptions the God that we serve tonight is able to far succeed your greatest imagination your greatest fantasy your greatest desire he wants to do more for you than you can even conjure up in your mind think about that God tonight think about your greatest desire that you need from God or that you want from God and God is here to tell you I will far succeed that I will meet your expectations but not only meaning how go way beyond your expectations tonight we can imagine more and the most of that what God could possibly do ahead after all of our great imaginations like all of our great thoughts God was able to do more for us than we can even ask he's willing to do more for us than we can even think and here's the thing about it God knows what you have need of before you even ask and we find that play out in Solomon's life God knew exactly what Solomon had need us before we even asked he needed wisdom he need a direction oh and God what did he do he not only did he blessed him with wisdom into Bechet he blessed him with wealth and finances and things of that nature so god knows what we had need of before we asked hearing the message when their eyes rope and I just want to read this clip here is in a prayer line brother BAM speaking to as soon as he goes now if the Lord will reveal to me what your trouble you believe me to be his prophet or a servant you believe it's him the sister says yes yes I know it you you will I thank you sister sure now I believe that's kidney trouble you've been suffering with will leave you do you believe that too he goes you got a request notice now he goes you got a request in your heart you want to ask me how I love this next part what if I reveal your request before you ask me would it make you believe more she said sure you want me to pray for your daughter she's not here that's right you want me to you want me to reveal what's her trouble it's a real nervousness you now believe and she got well see God bless you sister so God knew what her need was before she even spoke it out and God knows your needs before you even speak it he knows what we have need of in John 16 of verse 23 if you'd go there brother if you'd cut me down just a little bit you don't mind John 16 and verse 23 if we drop into the scripture it says whatsoever you ask the Father in my name he may give it you know he's gonna pray about it and he's gonna think about how good you are and he you know we gonna get back to you no whatsoever you ask the Father in my name he will give it to you Oh Church then why are we fearful why are we Freddy notice here in John 16 and 24 here there to that word that word here there to means now at this time have you asked me nothing in my name then he's saying he's encouraging and you shall receive that your joy may be full God wants us to ask but many times were profitable we don't want to ask God anything always feel like we're we're bothering God how many you had to go ask the brother for something you needed a hand a favor come on and you just felt kind of shy about it you didn't know what the response is gonna be and maybe they'll say yeah I knew you're praying they'll say you and you got some butterflies you know because maybe you need to borrow a lot of money or maybe need to borrow their truck or whatever it may be but this is not who we're approaching we're approaching God and God wants to give you the very desires of your heart he had many times we were reluctant to to petition God because we treat God like a man we treat God like a brother that maybe his answers gonna be no his answer may be no but his hedge was gonna be the right answer every time he God knows what you have need of well before you ask so he wants us to ask him ask that your choice may be fooled and he's ready and willing to provide everything you ask here in the messes where is he King of the Jews but map says now we believe that you are here this morning can we believe that he's here tonight omnipresent and is more than willing to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think imagine if we came to every service believing God was going to move what brother Joe we're quarantined that don't stop God he's omnipresent he's omniscient he's all-knowing all-powerful he's everywhere what are we worried about if we came and approached every service believing that God was going to move maybe you don't have a need but maybe your brother has a need maybe your sister has a need maybe a parent has a need or a sibling hasn't he but what have we approached every service under the expectation that God is gonna meet that need oh what kind of church would we be with Church on fire for God will be a church seeing the miraculous take place in our midst and I say we're that kind of church but I also say God is willing to pour it out more and more and more do you believe that tonight Church so everything that we have neither of the property God will tell us it's in you when you receive the baptism of Holy Ghost you believe that so we find many people have been desiring the Holy Ghost you know a lot of times we think it's gonna be some great big supernatural event you're gonna be at the altar and all of a sudden you're gonna be baptized in the Holy Ghost and you're gonna speak in tones you're gonna run around and you're gonna do something supernatural and the church is gonna push it up on the sign outside and Fox News is gonna call you and get your report seeing in is gonna write an article about it and you're going to be on the headline how I got the Holy Ghost that's not how God moves a lot of times has seen your own personal prayer closet but God comes down just as we heard this past week with one of our sisters how God came down through a course of prayer and she had a desire she needed to know what God had really done for her and she really had the Holy Ghost and her answers were met before she laid on the bed that night that's the God we serve he's a God that's willing to meet your need and meet your expectations I just believe him the thing that we need to do church is to quit waiting and expecting some supernatural event for the infilling of the Holy Ghost and just take God at His Word he says I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost just accept it he promised you the Holy Ghost now begin to take God at His Word but see a lot of times we have a part to play in this you know we find that when you're tempted you have a part to play in temptation whether you yield to it or whether you turn away and resist it we find that the enemy comes in his own slot and he comes and he comes and he comes in the Bible would tell us to resist the devil and he shall flee and the brother branham would tell us in marriage of the Lamb he said if the Lord will take this EVO he goes so mean he says excuse me somebody says if the Lord will take his evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him notice his replies but that's up to you now I want you to pie this same principle not just for sin but for your need tonight there's some things you go we got needs in our life and you know maybe we're we got the Holy Ghost and yet we we're doing things that we may not should do and it's hindering the moving of the Spirit are moving up of us getting our needs met but God is saying right here we got a part to play in that he says now they that overcome him shall inherit all things day that overcome he goes you have a power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see God cannot push you through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh he says you had nothing to know overcome he just pushed you through but you got to make decisions yourself I have to make decisions myself in doing that we show our faith in our respect to God and they would we find this in Israel they were promised a promised land but they had to fight for every inch and if you want the blessings of God if you want the promises of God you're gonna have to fight for every inch you got the scrap you're gonna have to fight tooth and nail and in toga line with the enemy because he's relentless and we find many people are running in fear over Koba 19 cope with 19 is nothing to be fearful about we serve a living God we serve a mighty God if it was something that the bride should fear don't you think he would have put in a Prophet's mind and a profitable revealed it and said beware of what's coming but no we understand as a believer today that the planes may be all around us we know that hey we may get it but who care because we serve a living God he's able to deliver he's willing to deliver he's here to set free he's a God that's greater than Koba 19 and he's greater than eating disease and I come out in 2020 but we got a fight to hold our Christian example we got a fight and not let fear dictate our lives and anxieties and worries hone us and attack us the land is ours the promise belongs to us everywhere the soles of your feet shall tread upon that is given to you andrew is given to you tonight as a young man that you can serve God with a heart full of passion see God but man will say God has a power to heal you if you got the courage to accept it God has the power to heal let me just say like as God has the power tonight to give you every promise if you got the heart of faith if you got courage tonight to withstand the enemy and take God and His Word God has the power to heal you God has the power to bless you God has a power to meet your need but do you got the curse on a bride that stand up against the enemy and claim your healing and claim your deliverance ain't claim whatever you have me of whatever I promise that God is giving you you've got to fight for it ain't claiming as your own see this holds true for every promise God has a power to meet our expectations but do we have the courage and the faith to accept it and you're gonna have to fight well man we'll make a statement in the message expectations whatever you expect you usually give let us apply that to church I understand we only have a handful of people tonight but he says now in regards to your expectations whatever you expect is what you usually get and you find some people come on they sleep they find some people to drag in 15 minutes after the preaching starts where's the expectation where is the belief that God is gonna move where is the expectations God is going to save my lost loved ones how he's going to heal those that are in need or whatever the need may be when we drag in on God and we expect God to do wondrous works but yet we usually give what we expect remember till he says now you heard about the lady that prayed for the mountain to be moved and she got up the next morning she looked out the window she said just as I expected still there now she prayed for it to move but she expected when she woke up it was still going to be there how many of us pray the same way how many of us pray and believe that God with God we want you to do something but in our heart our expectation is we're gonna face that same problem we're gonna face that same demon we're gonna face that same depression we're gonna face that same fear the next morning it's just going to reciprocate we're gonna go through the same day the same life day after day sarch we gotta believe that God's going to keep his word oh we just need to walk away from it but I'm gonna tell you God will keep his word if you've got the courage tonight to say yes Lord I believe yes what I accept the promises of God maybe you come to the service and you know we find here do you get what you expect and brotherman would say no if you expect that's what you receive if you come to this meeting saying well I'm gonna go down there I'm going to just find some some flowers or the meeting I'm gonna find some flaws of that preacher I bet you can you want to come here tonight and you want to find flaws and brother Joe Adams you can find flaws I'm not perfect I don't claim to be perfect none of us claim to be perfect but are we here to find flaws already here to find Christ but he says if you come with the desire her expectation of find flaws he says you'll find flaws of that preacher I bet you can't don't worry you'll get it the devil will show you plenty of them yes sir he goes you go back there you said just as I expected that's just to what it is you know he said it was the same group that found fault with Jesus noticed us the Pharisees and the Sadducees walked right by and turned her nose up at a but a harlot to give her life to God because she saw something that they didn't see because she was expecting to be changed she needed to be changed but if you don't know you have a desire or a need to be changed what can he change you from the road Ram says now just as you expect that's what you get because you come to this meeting expecting to see the glory of God moving the power of God sinners being sane filled with the holy ghost sickness being healed then watch what God shows you if you cope with that expectation evening light when we get together back again what will our expectations be he won't be six seven eight people in the church this size not to be 300 280 whatever the congregation whatever size the people feel here but what if we came with an expectation of seeing the sick healed what if we came with an expectation seen the power God release sinners from their bondage in their prison bars what if we had an expectation that God will come down and fill all our young people who've yet to be filled he says watch what God will show you will see a church in action with a seal supernatural on the move will see God's feeling will see God healing if we come with the next vacation God is able and God ah ah maybe God set this whole thing aside just to get us where we're more consecrated more dedicated and when we come back our expectations are through the roof maybe there'll be the end of the sleeping people on the pews and the ones dragging in late maybe they'll realize churches are blessing churches and honor only ever go to the house of God and hear the word preached with power and anointing and revelation and demonstration oh we're not some take charts and I don't wanna throw up on the tape Church oh but God has called us under a fivefold ministry forsake not the 'silly the together as those have come accustomed to because of the surroundings of the government or this pushed or that pushed or this idea or that idea we come to meet not with just one another but we come to meet with God and each of us here tonight we begin to create an atmosphere that the Holy Spirit can move and the Holy Spirit can work and if we come with an expectation oh say poured out Lord let the Holy Ghost fall let the unknown he come down like the supernatural take over the service oh I just think about it I wonder what this service would be tonight if right now right now 15 minutes eight please start believing we start believing co19 is gonna be pushed back look out start believing we're gonna start we're gonna begin to meet again here very soon and gather together and draw strength from one another I wonder if we can just tonight begins I've set our minds I wanted to be like when we're able to come back in the house of God and hear the music being played Holy Ghost field music and the anointing begin to flow forth from the preacher's mouth oh I wonder what kind of revival would take place I wanted there be one somebody maybe you're out on the internet tonight and you're streaming you say brother don't we're quarantined we can't feel what you're feeling we don't feel that anointing I'm gonna tell you God ain't bound by just these four walls God's able to move right there in your room God is able to heal right there in your room quarantine has nothing to do with God I wonder right there in your living room in your bedroom in your closet wherever you are your study if you can believe and begin to expect God to do what he said you do what would happen tonight well what happened sister Shalom in India you're believing for that cancer to leave what would happen brother Ron tonight is we're all behind you believing for your faith to be elevated and the supernatural just take place what I happen tonight for the jewel this demon trying to take your life to an early grave what would happen if we would just expect the supernatural God promised another Church God promised another book of Acts we're they're gonna fit that book because we're not grafted in limbs however we're born again of the same bond the same spirit the same anointing the same Holy Ghost that poured out on the book of Acts church is the same Holy Ghost is here so what would happen evening like Tabernacle and bride around the world if we can put our doubts aside and start believing start expecting I'm talking more than just believing a lot of times we believe God can do something but we don't expect it to happen in my life we believe for somebody else but what about for me what about expecting for yourself he said that he would heal our sick he said that we could have whatsoever things we desire I believe tonight as the Bible would tell us in Luke 10 and 19 I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy he's giving you power tonight to tread on serpents scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means harm you or hurt you so that doesn't mean you're not going to be prone from diseases sickness flu whatever they everything else is going on but what it does mean is it's not going to hurt you the God that we serve is greater mightier stronger more powerful more dominant what would happen tonight if we would begin to believe that God sent us all thing in order because it's not this didn't take God by surprise God knew about Cova 19 and to be honest with you the devil had to get permission before he could pour it out but what would happen tonight if God sent all this aside to shut everybody down so you're not looking at this sporting event you're not going over here you're not visiting with somebody every night of the week and you know your quarantine your shutting with your family so God could begin to move on the heart of a prodigal what will begin to have done if we would begin to believe and pray and expect God to move on our prodigal we see brother Justin we're here we know the story of brother Justin how his little sister came up for prayer and within 20 minutes God came down in a bedroom and began to deal with a young man who was way without in the world doing god knows what and yet he staggered into the house of God made his way to the altar gave his heart to God and he's never been the same if God can do that for one certainly he can do for your prodigal certainly he's the same God tonight certainly God didn't expense all his energy on Justin and now nobody else can be saved let's think about brother Phillip Roncalli I think about that testimony I believe that testimony is not so much about brother Phillip pull more about sister Mandy and the kids and how they prayed and how they come I mean every service they were getting a prayer cloth and brother Phillip sit when he finally got saved he looked under his mattress and he had a mound of prayer cloth but you see a wife of children they begin to pray and begin to believe and they begin to expect God's move and they seen the ups and they seen her down they seen the dips in the valleys they've been through hard time but yet God remained faithful and God came down on a Wednesday night service in an unexpected way and God began to move on a man's heart and he surrendered his heart to God and now he's one of the greatest blessings that evening light has ever had I'm gonna take God and still able and willing to move on and maybe we should expect it tonight maybe we should have steak why do we build that mezzanine he wasn't just to look at it wasn't just to say well we got enough room to sit so so we've built it to fill it up and I believe God is able tonight to do just that I believe what we called an expectation gotta fill his church but more importantly God will feel the heart God will fill the heart of the believer so that prodigal who's been wavered do you eat though tonight in the you on the stream that you re creator you look at yourself I don't look like much short dumpy losing my hair I'm a crater absolutely because you're a part of God but LEM said do you know each of you is a creator you're a part of God your sons of God an offspring of God a daughter of God is that right then you are a creator and I'll say tonight it's time that we start using that created a power that's inside of us to create an atmosphere to create an atmosphere that's conducive through the moving of the Spirit of God to create an atmosphere suppose yo we're quarantined but your Creator right there in that little room watching that television screen there's a monitor for whatever you want to call it your computer screen you can begin to create an atmosphere and you can aim and respond to the word there just as you are in a church pew and that same anointing will still feel that room as he's filling this room tonight both of em said you just put one or two good members in a church how many Church good church members do I have here tonight I got two that was a joke I got you all on that one now we're delayed brother Timothy you know you're delayed you got to be the first one no program says now you put one or two good members in a church that's really on fire for God introduce something for that church more than 40 row files think about it more than 40 you camps we've had 34 years of this would have been our 34th year if you kept supernatural weekends and yet the prophet of God let's say you give me one or two give me one on this side give me one on that side give me one out there on internet and you put them in the church and they begin to create an atmosphere it'll do more for that church and 40 revivals oh I'll say come on somebody it's time we get on fire for God it's time we get illuminated and regulated and let me tell you quit worrying about the mechanic and say God fill me with the dynamic fill me with the power I believe church were living in Bible days I believe the Bible signs are here we've seen it we've witnesses here sister Atlanta and little drew and different ones brother David Esther I mean there's a list goes oh no sister Karen it I mean how many we see we we have seen the miraculous take place but God said I will do exceeding abundantly don't limit the moving of the Spirit but even like a vertical justice sister Atlanta or just to this one just to Mariah or just that one what about you and your needs what about your expectation what about the fulfilling of the problems of God to you tonight yes God he says I will do exceeding abundantly above all that you can even ask above all that you can even facile above all that you can even think Oh God and I'm here tonight on the Wednesday night with a handful of people but I'm here to bless you I'm gonna meet your expectations I believe church that God is doing extreme things in a time of darkness he's doing extreme thing well brother Jill was so extreme about it we're all shut in our homes and don't stop God your location doesn't hinder God I've told this testimony once before in regards to brother Jason run collie we all know Jason that he grew up in the church and and he was running from the president the Lord he's tried to serve God through different times of his life and wonderful guys my cousin I love him to death but well you know he was running from the Lord and he's got a faithful wife praying like sister Manny praying that gotta get upon his heart and move upon him and do something for him personally and supernaturally and you know and he was expecting God to do something supernatural - he was gonna be a big thing everybody was gonna know about it one day he was driving his truck or his car he was doing I guess a converter route and he ran a red light and he shouted up cuss word because a whole man this is going south quick but conviction fell upon his heart like that and he began to repent not only for cussing but for the life that he was living and not only when he began to repent and begin to confess God he said the presence of God came into that car that truck and right there in an unexpected place in an unexpected way he met God and he's not been the same since so God understands you maybe quarantine but he can still meet you where you are he is still God he walked through walls when he was hearing on this this earth after the resurrection he can walk through walls today no matter how high you built on how thick you made up your walls will not hinder God from moving if you can believe all things are possible see God is able to do exceeding abundantly he's not concerned about your physical location he's ready for you tonight to take him at his word he's ready for you tonight to doubt your doubts and believe that what he says he will do he will do he's ready tonight for his bride to move do you believe that I believe he's ready to see the bride begin to move in the direction of the supernatural and then we heard a prophet say the move is on for the bride that's does saith the Lord if the move is on why are we moving that's what some will want you to think why aren't we moving because they're stuck in maybe a creed or an idea ideology of what the bride should be or how the bride should work but the move is on for the bride because not only does she possess the mechanics of the word she has the dynamics to go with it and when the mechanics begin to mesh up with the dynamics then he can do it seeding abundantly above all that we can even think you believe that tonight I believe it's time that we begin to take God at His Word and begin to ask God to do extreme things I don't want to bug you're not talking to a man you're talking to your Creator he wants you that's where brother Branham says he wants us to ask and believe that our choice would be full he wants you to ask abundantly I mean sometimes you feel like you where God out know you wearing yourself out God wants you to ask that your joy sister Laurieann will be full notice he says ask for big things and that it's hard for some of us cuz we're simple people we don't want to be big shots we don't want God I want the biggest house God don't know that's not how he's operating but he want you to ask for big things ask for impossible things humanly your situation may be impossible for you but not for the God that you serve so he wants you to ask for big things he said don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed get on out here and some of that other kind of faith move on out there and big things big things is just as easy to receive as little things we've just witnessed at our church a major event you say Rosa what are you talking about a year ago the presence of God met in the back office but 15 years prior a daughter of God and the Son of God had been praying for God to move the Bible would say that Abraham was sterile and his wife Sarah was barren both of them had an issue but he still God and he's able to do extreme things big things and he wants us to ask for big things brother Evan was saying this way in the Misses inspiration he says God wants us to ask for big things see my god he don't run out of blessings up there you can't ask for too much could you imagine a little fish about this song out there in the middle of an ocean saying I better drink of this much water you know it might dry up that's sometimes that's how we think humanly speaking we're gonna wear God out if I keep coming back to the well eventually I'm gonna get to the bottom of it you can exhaust the inexhaustible fountain of life you can't where god out God is the infinite God he's the one who's got bountiful blessings and the Bible say that he daily loaded us with blessings I say pack it up and put it on me God I won't every blessing how much you know poor now give me big things give me impossible things you see my situation but I can't get out of it I can't go through it I can't get around it but God I know that you're my god and I am the apple of your eye maybe you moved from me tonight move this situation back and let me walk on through to dry ground if he can do it for the children Israel with the Orion coming behind them in a red sea in front and mountains on either side they have nowhere to go but God made it way I'm gonna take even like Cameron he's here to make a way for you tonight if you just believe God if you're just ask God and say I'll take you at your word tonight Lord God said we'll heed to do exceeding in abundance notice what he says now see that's just unreasonable as it would be or more so unreasonable than to think that God's blessings would ever be exhausted to a believer to think that a little fish could drink up the whole ocean that's gonna be a big fish when it's all over with and where is all that water going never thought about that one did you he says all heaven belongs to you notice all heaven belongs to you so I say it's time we ask we ask God to begin to repair broken marriages a backbone of a family to structure a solid family husband and wife man and woman raising their kids in the fear and admonition of God supporting each other it's our posted duty at church Wednesday Sunday every time the doors open God begins to repair the marriages ask God to bless your finances this is not some some free loaf and messes or anything like that some get-rich-quick scheme I'm trying to preach to you some you know some prosperity messes no but I believe God knows your heart he knows your situation I don't believe it's too much say God blessed me I'll use it for the glory of God has Gaza begin to heal and restore your body perfect health the doctor says he can't do anymore brother Bram said that's when you jump off that tree a lie or the tree of knowledge of good and evil and you jump on the Tree of Life and keep on going cuz he's still God God I want you to restore me home Keeler's told brother Ron I want you to restore brother Mickey brother Vern and sister Shalom brother Jewel and I want you to restore the shut-ins some of those that can't make it because of their age God made you begin to restore their bodies to physicality to him and let them come back to the house of God and begin to experience the services again God asks you to save the lost son the lost daughter says sin has been mounted on them so much scar with tattoos and ptsds and things of that nature all are down through life just made a mockery of their life shame to the parents but God I'm not gonna look at their shame I'm not gonna look at their sin I'm not gonna look at their baggage god I'm asking you tonight to begin to move move on their heart tonight and as we take this time we don't know when we're gonna be open back up to have services but take the opportunities that God reveal yourself to me in a way that you've never done before you made a promise in the book of Joel that you'll pour out your spirit your sons and your daughters will receive a revelation an anointing God let it be upon me let me take this time wherever you don't have people over every night and we take this time I may we focus on the things that you want us to focus on why you shut our nation or world or economics down let me take this time to ask for something big baptize all of my kids with the Holy Ghost that should be our prayer that should be our desire and when we come back and these doors are open probably would be flooding into this place like water just pouring in people on fire for God because moms and dads brothers and sisters begin to pray and expect God to move now mark 11 verse 24 as we begin to start bringing this down start bringing this down and say I was talking to he said what thing soever ye desire when you pray so we got something to do Church Joseph you got something to do tonight as a young man Andrew you got something to do as a young man just ol orianna's a lady a sister in this church you have something to do whatsoever things ye desire when ye pray notice he's making it personal believe that you receive them and you shall have them that word desire means crave there's something inside of you you just don't understand what it is but it's a craving so longing there's a desire and it's a righteous desire that's a craving God place it there and he's wanting you to pray that he will feel it he knows what you have need of the word believed there means to be persuaded of if you can believe notice be persuaded take to oneself to procure it to yourself to take a hold of it then ye shall that's your promise that's your promise that he will do exceeding abundantly but you got to ask and believe and receive see this is not mind over matter this is God's Word and there's no limitations to what you can ask God in his word whatever you crave tonight whatever your desire is tonight whether it be healing whether it be deliverance maybe fears tormented you maybe anxiety and depression is worried you during this time maybe it's because you're going insane or crazy in your quarantine condition because you just love to be around people I understand that we're all ready to get back to hug each other were southerners we want to hug everybody brothers hugging brothers now we're gonna clarify that sisters hugging sisters husband and wife y'all gonna hug each other you know put that clip dad put that out there but but you understand what I'm saying we won't what was normal once again but take the opportunity that's afforded us right now to meet God in a way if you've never met him and expect God in the way you never expected and to believe God with faith that you never had before notice now we begin to wrap this throne up I believe tonight church as LeBron said we are a creator there's a creative power that lives in each of us tonight and I believe we can take that creator that created power within us and we could speak another word if we got the power of speak another world and go live on it brother Andrew what about your desire what about speaking to your desire tonight what about God moving for your need and your need tonight I believe we're gonna be a people that we're gonna see cancer defeated not just one time but over and over and over and over for the Vernon for the Mickey for the Ron sisters Shalom cancer has no place in your life there's a creative power inside of you tonight to speak to that demon of cancer and say you gotta leave and he has to obey the Word of God I believe tonight we're gonna see high blood pressure brother Timothy defeated because it doesn't belong in the body of the believer it's a foreign object it's a squatter we're called to possess the land and we got to start on possessing this land I believe tonight we're gonna see diabetes defeated we're gonna see I don't mean brother Aaron we're gonna see diseases like that defeated and God rest directing testimonies of what he's doing we're gonna see broken homes restored we're gonna see and witness again that God is still in the demon casting out business the Bible was saying Daniel 11:32 he says and so and such as do wickley against a covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people how about it the brother Christ but the people that know their God shall be strong and do exploits that word their strong means they will grow strong they will prevail they will be courageous they will be resolute and firm the people that know their God they're not so wishy-washy jellyfish believer but they know that the God that they serve he's greater let me tell you he's like the Hebrew children we're not gonna bow we're not gonna be we're not gonna break our God is able to deliver but if he don't we're still not coming down we're not backing down we're not crawling down we're not backing up we're gonna move forth and go straight to the fiery front because we believe the gods do we sir he's able tonight he seems to do Forex eat my human capacities and abilities and my great thinking of orienting my mental conception my God is able tonight the people that know their God will be strong in the Lord and they will do exploits that word there means courageous feats daring feats what is so courageous because he's asking you to believe in a time of darkness he's asking you to trust him in a time of uncertainty brother Timothy he's asking you to believe in a resurrection not 2000 years ago but tonight tonight he's asking to believe in an Eastern that's gonna happen tomorrow because somebody's gonna meet Jesus and the resurrection power is gonna be alive in their hearts in their lives he's asking you to believe tonight in the supernatural when everything is turning dark all the hell is against this little bra he said there will be alike he provided you a light in the end time and we got just enough light to see the bra through to eternity oh hell he can't put the light out of this bride Oh church the Bible says that we're going to do exploits daring feats notice we're not just surviving Laodicea oh no we're not just getting by hobros oh I I'm just you know what I understand what it's like to go through trials and tribulations Hornaday and what it's like to be stressed out and wore out and come home daily you just have your head your your head bowed down because the pressure of this world just begins to be so great but you know what it don't don't mean about three weeks ago during the shut-in I needed to shut in because then I'm closing right here I needed to shut in because I need a God to come and speak to me in a personal way I face trials I face tribulations I face situations on the job hey many of you know about I talk to it about a little a little bit but it just kept getting worse and worse and he just coming into work you know and we begin to watch the series on the chosen and I'm not here to advocate for that but if you hadn't seen it I'd encourage you to go see it so I guess I am advocating for it very good series on the life of Christ very good biblical great you know when we begin to look at that and you know I'm gonna count it and I deal with numbers on a daily basis see if for the hospital and I begin to hear this guy Dallas Jenkins begin to speak and how he he sought after one a career path and it failed in his face and God had to Humble him down and get him on his knees to reveal to him what he was going to do and he and he begin to start this series and writes his series on the chosen but God had to humble him he when he got to certain places during this series said he needed to finances in God the rest of his response to to Dallas Chingiz which is a biblical responses in the Book of Luke and maybe Matthew in a couple other chapters there but he says I need you to feed the 5,000 they wanted the disciples one of the Sydenham away because it was getting late and they hadn't been with Jesus three days and they had no food to feed him Jesus says what are you have he says we got a couple of fish in a few loaves here he says you bring me the fish and you bring me the loaves and I'll do the feeding of 5,000 let me tell you a church that's what I needed to hear it's not my responsibility to feed the 5,000 it's my responsibility he's your responsibility to bring the fishes and to bring the load you say brother do anything about money it's not about money but your fish tonight maybe your aim in your mouth tonight maybe your witness and your testimony if you'll just bring the fishes and you'll just bring the load gotta do the feeding of the 5,000 gotta pour out the place got a response to the heart of a believer how could I begin to ponder that thought I said God so you're telling me it's not my responsibility I got 400 and some employees depending on me to make the right decisions and I guess I just hear just reiterate back you just bring the fishes in the luvs you do what you got the best that you got you bring it to me and you ask and I'll show you what I'll do visit can I give you a quick testimony ISM you musician to stay there because you're all I got stay put until we're almost done so we find this copán 19 has had a drastic impact on hospital why it's Hospital cash Hospital revenues hospitals around the world right now around the nation excuse me in our country hospitals are closed and rural hospitals are closing like that every day hospital shutting the stores because rural hospital reimbursement is horrible just it's not there because the clientele the patient mixes it's just not there and I know I'm speaking over everybody's head but just let me to speak to this just for a few minutes and so our hospital is not not carved out of that I was thinking you know god you're gonna make me to see it for the hospital we're gonna be blessed it's gonna be great we're gonna be I mean I'm just thinking man because I'm there it's gonna be wonderful how a sorely disappointed God had to teach me a lesson and ain't about you but it's about you being faithful I told my wife I say that God has got to be sick and tired of hearing me pray about that Hospital but it's it's the trial that I've been in because I don't look at it is I can lose my job that's fine I'll find another one but there's $10 an hour $8 an hour employees maybe they won't find the job as easy as I could in our communities 400 of the name are depending on me to make the right decision not only that 13 to 15 thousand people in our community are depending on us to make the right decision so that we can provide health care in this community because what happens when you got to get in an ambulance and you may not make a 45 minute drive a Shreveport you need a hospital and so the pressure just been looming on me Laura and we're gonna know how we're gonna pay bills cash is strapped we've all this kind of stuff and I was facing a payroll a couple weeks ago after watching that series at first Sears said okay you got this Lord and we prayed about it my family and I we prayed about it that night and I'm bringing the fishes and loaves you feed the 5,000 got there on Tuesday morning payrolls got to be done by Wednesday Cash's getting I'm checking the cash every day I know what it's gonna take to make the gross payroll the net payroll and would you believe we made up by $20,000 some who praise the Lord man god is good what God was testing my faith last week and we prayed again I said man we're we're were several hundreds of thousands of dollars away from making it god I don't know what to do and they just I woke up that morning honestly got a woke up that morning and I read it my devotion in the book of Matthew and he talked about bringing the fishes in the loaves you bring the fish in the lowest Alfie to five thousand I said okay god this was on a Tuesday morning got to work my controller email me I said what what what are we what's the shortfall because we were several hundred thousand dollars away from the knee before when this excuse me this is Wednesday morning and so she sent me the message and I was like Oh heartbeats we're $100,000 off and now honestly so god you said you would feed the five thousand if I did what was right but we prayed to by the committed it to you and so I'm scrambling around thing and what am I going to do to get this money so that people can get their paychecks and if anybody on the work is hearing this you have to forgive me but this is a testimony because God said I'll do it seething abundantly all that you can ask her thing so now I'm emailing the corporate lady the payroll lady I said okay this is where we are let me know when you get to a number and I know what this number normally is and I know where I'm sitting in the cash reserves I'm thinking this is gonna be a fun Wednesday my brother Timothy priests kind of be certain of God in uncertain times and I've listened to that message to be certain to God multiple times even when he remains silent you still got to believe he's God and that he hears so him about three o'clock rolled around she finally emailed me says here's your number and I was like okay so I sent it to my controller I said how closer we are how far over now here's the final number she sent me back she said we made payroll by five thousand dollars if he can feed the five thousand he can do it seeding abundantly above all that we can ask and above all that we can think because he's still God he knows your situation he knows about the quarantine he knows the trials that you were facing before this but he also knows what you have need of and he's just waiting on you to ask oh that's just very father lord I thank you tonight we felt your presence here maybe the service went a little bit different than I expected but father I sure enjoyed being in your presence she would joy being under your anointing tonight and just allowing you to use the vessel I just trust Lord that the words would fall on fertile ground whoever he may just be a handful tonight but I felt like his brother Timothy said the first night he'd done this he was preaching to thousands I know what every time I would look into a camera I can just visualize faces different individuals brother Ron for the jewels sister Shalom brother Mickey for the Vernon the Hollis family my mother law in the situation she's facing my parents in their situation and I see these things just come to mind my god you said in your word it's not our responsibility to bring your word to pass it's our responsibility to trust you and obey it's how responsibility tonight as a believer to take you with your word and to believe tonight so all hell may be against us darkness is looming all around us yet father two people that know their God will do exploits and they'll be strong I just prayed tonight father you'll take the message and you'll you just allow it to just encourage the believer and elevate their faith I pray God for a supernatural time now in our homes Lord now you just come and meet with us Lord and when we consecrate our lives and dedicate our homes and Father token go to our lives but God more importantly maybe we just believe and begin to ask God to move to see God move to expect God to move Lord when these church doors will be open again in our our state and our local government and our nation will do away with the restrictions kind of pray that they will find the people more sincere more consecrated more dedicated won't earn this Lord they're not taking this time and just in our heart saying well we're glad we don't have to go to church and I we just stream but God made it become a and they become a hungry lor a craving on the inside to meet again with the believer and had their desires met and feel the atmosphere the Spirit of God singing and rejoicing songs the Jubilee father the presence of God poured down on your people screams Lord going up as a train of God will fill the temple the presence of God's coming and fallen on different ones here and there and the other and God see these back rows here in the mezzanine just pray Lord you'll use this time to get a heart of those protocol sword for the Tim our pastor built this church and had those therefore purpose a vision and I just see names rolling through my mind right now in different ones Lord I don't want to call him out but God I I just speak them in your name tonight you're forgetting to move right now on their heart there's a place in this church for them tonight and I asked a congregation and those on the stream can we believe that he's here to do exceeding abundantly can we believe tonight that the God that we serve wants to meet our expectations Lord I believe I believe tonight and father I ask that you forgive my unbelief god I thank you for revealing yourself in a greater way and taking care of your servant and your people Lord and I would just pray father you'll
