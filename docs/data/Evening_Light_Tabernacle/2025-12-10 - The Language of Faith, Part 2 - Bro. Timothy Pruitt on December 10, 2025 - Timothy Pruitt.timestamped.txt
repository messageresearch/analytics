[31:13] before I came in here, Lord. And and
[31:15] Lord, your grace is sufficient tonight.
[31:18] And I'm just looking under you to speak
[31:19] now, Father. Lord, every part of this
[31:21] service from here to the end. May you
[31:23] take complete control, [music]
[31:25] Lord. And that your your name will be
[31:26] lifted up. Satan's kingdom will be torn
[31:28] down, Lord, and things of eternal value
[31:31] can take place here in this place
[31:32] tonight, Father. So, we [music] commit
[31:34] this time into your hands now, Lord. in
[31:36] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. God [music] bless you this
[31:45] evening. If the brothers wouldn't mind
[31:47] receiving the offering tonight,
[31:49] certainly appreciate that. Let's sing
[31:51] together. My hope is in the Lord of F.
[31:55] Amen. Do you [music] stand in awe
[31:58] presence of the Lord?
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:03] I [music] stand [singing] in all within
[32:06] the presence of the Lord.
[32:12] In whom [music] the wisdom of the age
[32:16] [singing]
[32:17] is liing [music]
[32:22] [music and singing] of the sea
[32:26] subides.
[32:29] He's the living [singing and music]
[32:30] sacrifice.
[32:33] The only source
[32:36] of life, [singing]
[32:38] my [music]
[32:42] is in [singing] the Lord.
[32:46] From [music] this time on [singing]
[32:51] and ever [music] more,
[32:54] [singing]
[32:56] my hope
[32:59] is [music and singing] in the Lord
[33:04] forever
[33:06] more. [music]

[33:34] [singing]
[33:37] And those [music] who trust
[33:40] in him will find their
[33:42] [music and singing]
[33:43] hearts

[34:35] [music]
[34:37] You offer [singing]
[34:38] healing and forgiveness. [music]
[34:45] And those [music and singing] who trust
[34:50] will find their heart
[34:53] [music] and rest. [singing]
[34:55] My hope
[34:58] is in [music] the Lord.
[35:01] [singing]
[35:03] from this I
[35:07] [music and singing]
[35:13] [music and singing]
[35:16] is in the Lord.
[35:19] [singing]
[35:20] Oh
[35:22] go.
[35:25] Oh my god. [music and singing]
[35:32] [music]
[35:35] [singing]
[35:38] [music]
[35:44] [music and singing]
[35:54] [music and singing]
[35:57] Hallelujah.
[35:58] There's no greater place for your hope
[36:00] to be
[36:01] &gt;&gt; than in the Lord. Amen. Let's just go to
[36:04] him in prayer today. Father, [music]
[36:08] we come to you one more time, Lord. Just
[36:10] asking [music] that you would come and
[36:12] you would minister, you'd speak to our
[36:14] hearts and lives, Father, and touch us
[36:17] by your word, Lord, as only you can do.
[36:19] and [music] ask father that you would
[36:21] come and minister to every need
[36:22] according to your will and your way. We
[36:25] ask these things for your glory in Jesus
[36:27] [music] name. Amen.
[36:31] Amen. Let's turn to second Corinthians 4
[36:33] if you would. Amen.
[36:37] It's good to be in the house of the
[36:39] Lord.
[36:40] Amen.
[36:43] Second Corinthians 4 and verse 8.
[36:52] Just want to say that um if you have not
[36:54] seen the announcement, we're going to do
[36:57] some things a little different for our
[36:59] Wednesday nights before the Christmas
[37:00] and New Year's. So try to start at 6:00
[37:04] on both services and uh have a little
[37:06] refreshment time of fellowship afterward
[37:08] the Lord would permit. But amen, just
[37:11] kind of have some special services
[37:12] there. So, just want to announce that
[37:14] we'll be starting those services at 6:00
[37:16] p.m. so we can get out a little early
[37:19] and and um have some time together or if
[37:22] you need to get back for whatever for
[37:24] your activities, you're more than
[37:25] welcome to do so as well. Amen. Second
[37:28] Corinthians 4 and verse 8 says, "We are
[37:31] troubled on every side yet not
[37:34] distressed. We are perplexed but not in
[37:37] despair, persecuted but not forsaken,
[37:41] cast down but not destroyed, always
[37:44] bearing about in the body the dying of
[37:46] the Lord Jesus, that the life also of
[37:49] Jesus might be made manifest in our
[37:52] body. For we which live are always
[37:55] delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,
[37:58] that the life also of Jesus might be
[38:00] made manifest in our mortal flesh. So
[38:03] then death workketh in us, but life in
[38:05] you. And we having the same spirit of
[38:09] faith, according as is written, I
[38:11] believed, and therefore I've spoken. We
[38:14] also believe and therefore speak,
[38:17] knowing that he which raised up G the
[38:19] Lord Jesus shall also shall raise us up
[38:22] also by Jesus, and shall present us with
[38:25] you. For all things are for your sake,
[38:29] that the abundant grace might through
[38:30] the thanksgiving of many redown to the
[38:33] glory of God. For which cause we faint
[38:36] not, but through our outward man perish,
[38:38] yet the inward man is renewed day by
[38:40] day. For our light affliction, which is
[38:43] is but for a moment, workketh for us
[38:45] more exceedingly an eternal weight of
[38:48] glory. While we look not at the things
[38:50] which are seen, but the things which are
[38:52] not seen, for the things which are seen
[38:55] are temporal, but the things which are
[38:58] not seen are eternal. Amen. We let you
[39:01] be seated.
[39:07] I um sometimes you know
[39:11] u kind of war within yourself especially
[39:14] when you been speaking on the subject
[39:16] for some some time on faith you know if
[39:19] it's time to to go somewhere else or do
[39:22] something different or or what to do and
[39:24] so I got to looking at it actually
[39:26] started speaking on faith um different
[39:29] different titles of faith about two
[39:31] years ago or it was almost two years ago
[39:34] December nomber the 13th of 23. And so
[39:37] when you've been that well long, you
[39:39] kind of get you don't want to get
[39:40] redundant and you don't want to feel
[39:42] like you're preaching the same thing
[39:43] over and over. And so I just been
[39:45] looking for something else. And and you
[39:47] know, asking the Lord, you know, why why
[39:49] can't I go somewhere else? Why can't I
[39:51] do something else? And and just brought
[39:53] this scripture back to me when Jesus as
[39:56] asked the question, when I return, will
[39:58] I find faith? You know Jesus never
[40:02] questioned when he came back would he
[40:04] find respect or would he find saints or
[40:07] never questioned would he find
[40:09] righteousness but what Jesus questioned
[40:12] was whether he would find or what he
[40:14] would find or not is will I find faith
[40:17] when I come brother speak about this a
[40:20] couple times because I I was just
[40:21] looking at this because it's just
[40:23] answered the question in my own heart
[40:25] and says now living upon the repetition
[40:27] reputation of our forefathers when pride
[40:30] things is eat like termites to the
[40:32] foundation of our great civilization.
[40:34] Seeing men modernize things, leaving off
[40:37] the Holy Spirit, adopting reading or
[40:40] writing or arithmetic for the power of
[40:42] God. He said, "Oh father, then to see
[40:44] those who still have that living faith."
[40:48] We think of our master when he said,
[40:50] "When I return, will I find the faith?"
[40:53] He did not question sincerity or
[40:55] Christianity. He said, ' Will I find
[40:58] faith when I come?' He said, ' Then you
[41:00] asked this question. Will I find faith
[41:02] when I come upon the earth? You never
[41:04] asked, "Will I find church members? Will
[41:06] I find creeds? Will I find sincerity?"
[41:08] You said, "Will I find faith when I come
[41:11] to the earth?" And he says, "Lord, may
[41:13] these sick people let their faith
[41:15] loose." He said, "Come, may people come
[41:18] away from their frustrations and their
[41:20] doubts and their fears and may their
[41:23] faith be turned loose just now. And if
[41:25] they turn their faith loose, then all
[41:28] sickness will turn loose. The devil will
[41:30] lose his hold and they'll be set free by
[41:33] the power of almighty God. And it will
[41:35] let the Holy Ghost surge in every heart
[41:37] and baptize every soul and heal
[41:39] everybody in that divine presence. Grant
[41:42] it, Lord, for this I ask that the devil
[41:44] leave every person that they're
[41:46] tormenting in here tonight in the name
[41:48] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Satan, turn
[41:51] yourself loose from these people.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So just looking at that and
[41:56] thinking of of this, you know, I believe
[41:58] that's why it's been pressed on my heart
[42:00] so hard to preach on faith because, you
[42:03] know, we we live in a very faithless
[42:05] generation. And it's very easy sometimes
[42:09] to to lose faith and you lose faith in
[42:11] governments, you lose faith in people,
[42:13] you lose faith in a lot of things. But
[42:15] there's one thing that we should never
[42:17] lose faith in is in the word of God.
[42:19] because that word of God will stand true
[42:22] no matter what else turns away and
[42:23] whatever whether the stock market's up
[42:26] or down or the governments are doing
[42:27] whatever that word remains the same. And
[42:30] so it's something that we can put our
[42:32] our faith and we can have a foundation
[42:34] to lean upon. And so I tonight I want to
[42:37] again speak on the language of faith
[42:39] because I believe that faith has a
[42:42] voice. It has a language. It does not
[42:44] whisper defeat. It declares victory.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It does not tremble when giants
[42:50] step out and begin to make challenges,
[42:52] but it'll stand and proclaim the battle
[42:55] is the Lord's.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. When fa faith will speak when
[42:59] storms are still raging, it'll speak.
[43:02] It'll speak before seas will part,
[43:04] before walls fall, before the answer
[43:06] arrive. Faith does not wait for proof.
[43:10] Faith is the proof.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith does not wait for proof. It
[43:15] is the proof. Because we read in Hebrews
[43:18] 11:1, faith is the substance or the
[43:21] proof of things that are hoped for, the
[43:23] evidence of things that are not seen.
[43:26] Amen. Anybody or anyone can celebrate
[43:29] after a miracle. Anyone can speak after
[43:31] a miracle. Anyone can speak all kinds of
[43:34] things after a miracle takes place. But
[43:36] faith speaks before the miracle happens.
[43:39] Faith begins to celebrate before the
[43:42] before the miracle comes. You know,
[43:43] because faith is not a myth. It's
[43:46] something that you actually possess.
[43:47] It's something. Amen. Brother man would
[43:49] put it like this in these terms. He
[43:51] said, "If I was starving, you would come
[43:53] and you'd say, I would say, I was
[43:54] starving." You say, "Well, what would
[43:56] save your life?" He said, "Well, a loaf
[43:57] of bread will save my life." He said,
[43:59] "You'd get in your pocket and bring out
[44:01] 25 cents and hand it to me and say, here
[44:03] you are. You better grab more than 25
[44:05] cents today." But, you know, it's what
[44:07] what it was back in his day. He said,
[44:08] "Here you are, Mr. Brandon. You don't
[44:10] have to starve." He says, "I wouldn't
[44:12] have the bread yet, but I got the
[44:14] purchase power of that bread." He said,
[44:16] "I may I may be a mile from that bread.
[44:19] I may, but I can be as happy with that
[44:21] quarter in my hand because I know once I
[44:24] put it there, I can get the bread that I
[44:26] need and that bread will fulfill the
[44:28] desire that I have. I've got the
[44:30] purchase power of the bread." And he
[44:32] said, "When the same thing is when faith
[44:34] is anchored, it's finished. You can be
[44:36] just as happy and already jumping and
[44:39] shouting because it's already over. You
[44:41] can have it as something you know you
[44:43] got. Nothing to move you. You'll never
[44:45] watch for any more evidences or anything
[44:47] else because you know you already have
[44:50] it. Amen. Say now when I get this bread
[44:53] this 25 cents rather I I may have to go
[44:55] over some hills. I may have to go
[44:57] through some brine patches. I may have
[44:59] to cross some waters. I may have to go
[45:01] across bridges. I may go through some
[45:03] rough times. I maybe I'll go through
[45:04] over a mountain or down some valleys,
[45:06] but all the time I can be rejoicing
[45:09] because I got the 25 cents,
[45:12] &gt;&gt; knowing that I'm going to get the bread
[45:14] just as soon as I get there. I have the
[45:17] purchasing power. Well, faith is the
[45:20] purchasing power of everything you ever
[45:23] hope for.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, when we have the faith,
[45:27] then we can already begin to praise God.
[45:29] We can already begin to rejoice. We can
[45:31] already begin to throw up our hands cuz
[45:34] nothing can move you. You know, you
[45:36] know, now I love this quote. Somebody
[45:37] just sent this to me. He said, brother,
[45:39] brother Jason Jackson sent this. He
[45:40] says, "We can preach the word. We can
[45:43] explain the word, but you have to
[45:45] receive the word with faith.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; You have to receive it." Amen. We can
[45:50] explain it. We can preach it till we're
[45:52] blowing the faith. But if you don't
[45:53] receive it, it won't do you a bit of
[45:55] good. Amen. But that's what sets it a
[45:57] fire is when you receive it.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on now. That's what makes it
[46:03] come alive is when you receive it. Now I
[46:06] can say I have 25 cents, but if you
[46:08] never take it out of my hand, that 25
[46:10] cents or that $320 or $5, whatever it
[46:13] costs for a loaf of bread nowadays,
[46:15] it'll never do you any good unless you
[46:17] receive it. Amen. You can't rejoice
[46:19] until you receive it. You can't shout
[46:21] until you receive it. But once you
[46:23] receive it into your hands, then you can
[46:26] rejoice. Then you can shout. That's why
[46:28] when the word comes forth and we receive
[46:30] it, we begin to amen. We begin to praise
[46:33] God. We begin to thank God as if it's
[46:36] already done. Even though we're still
[46:38] sitting in our seat and nothing has
[46:40] changed, nothing has moved, nothing has
[46:42] went went before our eyes and we can see
[46:44] clearly with our own eyes, but through
[46:46] THE EYES OF FAITH, WE BEGIN TO SAY,
[46:48] "IT'S already done."
[46:51] &gt;&gt; And so, this is where he's at. When you
[46:53] receive it, the word something slips out
[46:56] into the unseen world yonder and it
[46:59] comes rolling down through a mystical
[47:01] channel somewhere and it falls into your
[47:04] soul and YOUR SOUL SAYS NOW I SEE IT.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THEN YOUR EYES BRIGHTEN
[47:11] BRIGHTEN. Then your lips that hung down
[47:13] or frown they straighten up and SMILE
[47:16] AND EVERY MUSCLE IN YOUR BODY SEEMS TO
[47:18] REJOICE. SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
[47:22] AMEN.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. This is what happens
[47:25] when faith speaks with faith because
[47:27] faith has a voice. Faith has a language.
[47:30] It has a victory speech. Amen. The
[47:32] speech of of faith is not downtrodden.
[47:36] It's not down in the dumps. It's not
[47:38] unbelief. That's not the victory speech
[47:40] of faith. Victory speech of faith is it
[47:43] speaks and walls fall down.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's what he did with the walls of
[47:47] Jericho. Amen. For six days they walked
[47:50] around the walls. Nothing seems to
[47:51] change. Nothing seems to happen. But on
[47:53] the seventh day, a shout went forth. And
[47:56] after that shout, the walls fell down.
[47:59] Amen. It was a faith that spoke in a
[48:02] battle. And Jehoshaphat when you know
[48:04] God didn't give them swords. God didn't
[48:06] give them shields. YOU KNOW WHAT GOD
[48:08] GIVE THEM? GOD GAVE THEM A CHOIR TO GO
[48:10] out to battle with.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Ain't that amazing? Amen. God said,
[48:14] "This is all you're going to need to do.
[48:16] I'm going to put the words on your mouth
[48:17] and I want YOU TO START SINGING." AND
[48:20] WHILE YOU'RE SINGING, I'LL GO TO
[48:22] FIGHTING FOR YOU. WHILE YOU'RE PRAISING
[48:24] ME, I'LL GO TO RE I'LL GO TO KILLING
[48:26] YOUR ENEMIES. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID. And
[48:28] he faced a huge army. And God told them
[48:31] they wouldn't need to fight. AND JOSHUA,
[48:32] HE TOLD JOSH JEHOSHAPHAT TO set singers
[48:35] in front of the soldiers singing,
[48:37] "Praise the Lord, for his mercy endureth
[48:39] forever." And as they begin to sing, the
[48:43] Lord confused the enemy and they
[48:45] destroyed each other.
[48:48] That's why it's important when we come
[48:50] to the house of God that we begin to get
[48:52] in an atmosphere of rejoicing and an
[48:54] atmosphere of receiving. And how do you
[48:56] do it? By singing the songs of Zion. By
[48:59] singing and worshiping unto God. It's
[49:01] creating an atmosphere that you can
[49:02] actually receive something that'll
[49:04] something to go down through those
[49:06] channels somewhere and fall down to your
[49:08] soul to WHERE YOU CAN SAY IT'S ALREADY
[49:10] DONE.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; THE BATTLE IS OVER. AMEN.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; But faith says God is good even in a in
[49:19] the valleys.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's the God of the valley just as
[49:22] much as he's the God of the mountain.
[49:24] That's right.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know when we we can speak all kind
[49:27] of faith on top of a mountain and scream
[49:29] it out and hear echoes come back. Faith,
[49:31] faith, faith, faith, faith, faith,
[49:32] faith. But down in the valley, he's
[49:34] still God.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Hey, we can read this in First Kings 20
[49:38] and verse 26. It came to pass at the
[49:41] return of the year that Benad numbered
[49:43] the Syrians and went up to fight against
[49:44] Israel. And the children of Israel
[49:46] numbered and were all present went
[49:48] against them. And the children of Israel
[49:49] pinched before them like two little
[49:51] flocks of kids.
[49:54] [laughter]
[49:55] Can you can do you get the picture here?
[49:58] Do you know what a flock of kids is?
[50:00] &gt;&gt; How many knows what a flock of kid is?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Little goats or little sheep,
[50:05] &gt;&gt; little nothings.
[50:08] their big old army and over here's a
[50:11] couple flocks of kids.
[50:14] But the Syrians filled the country AND
[50:16] IT LOOKED IMPOSSIBLE AND IT LOOKED LIKE
[50:18] THERE THERE'S NOTHING NOTHING COULD
[50:20] TAKE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED?
[50:21] David made a challenge.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; They said, "We're going to fight him and
[50:25] them them in the valley because their
[50:26] god, he's a god of the mountain. He's
[50:29] not the god of the valley." And so they
[50:31] MADE THIS CHAP CHALLENGE AND THERE CAME
[50:33] A MAN OF GOD AND SPAKE unto the king of
[50:35] Israel and said, "Thus sayaith the Lord,
[50:36] because the Assyrians have said,"The
[50:38] Lord is the God of the hills, but he's
[50:40] not the God OF THE VALLEYS. THEREFORE, I
[50:42] will deliver all this great multitude in
[50:45] thy hand, and you shall know that I am
[50:47] the Lord." And they pitched over against
[50:49] the other seven days. And so it was in
[50:51] that seventh day, the battle was joined.
[50:54] And the children of Israel slew of
[50:56] Assyrians a 100,000 footmen in one day.
[51:00] See, ANCIENT CULTURES OFTEN OFF OFTEN
[51:03] believed each god ruled a a specific
[51:06] place or specific thing. There was a
[51:09] mountain god or they had a valley god or
[51:11] they had a god or they had a river god
[51:13] or they had a city god. THEY DIDN'T KNOW
[51:15] THAT THIS GOD HAD AUTHORITY NO MATTER
[51:18] WHERE YOU was at.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE HAD AUTHORITY OVER THE LAND. HE
[51:22] HAD AUTHORITY OVER THE SEA. HE HAD
[51:24] AUTHORITY OVER THE SKIES, OVER THE
[51:26] NATIONS, OVER EVERYTHING and anything.
[51:29] SEE, THIS GOD THAT YOU SERVE IS NOT
[51:32] LIMITED TO YOUR LOCATION.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT DOES NOT HE IS NOT
[51:38] LIMITED WHETHER YOU'RE ON A MOUNTAIN OR
[51:40] YOU'RE IN A VALLEY. HE'S THE SAME GOD
[51:42] TODAY.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; He's not limited to your location. He's
[51:48] the God of the mountain which represent
[51:50] victories or high places in your life or
[51:53] or spiritual strength. But he's also the
[51:56] God of the valleys. That's the trials
[51:58] and the sufferings and and the
[52:00] weaknesses. And he heard what he your
[52:02] enemy has said about you.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; That's why he would tell that's why
[52:10] David would say it like this in Psalms
[52:11] 23. Yay, though I walk through the
[52:14] valley of the shadow of death, I will
[52:16] fear no evil. That's faith speaking.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what Paul That's what Paul
[52:23] I want to go back to our opening
[52:24] scripture. That's what Paul was even
[52:26] speaking there. He says, "Troubled on
[52:28] every side yet not distressed."
[52:31] &gt;&gt; What was it? Faith spoke out.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The faith does not the faith does
[52:36] not deny reality. It does not deny what
[52:39] you're going through. That's not what
[52:40] faith is. Faith does not say, "Well, I
[52:42] don't have no trials. Hallelujah. Praise
[52:44] God. I don't have no sickness." how to
[52:46] know THERE'S REAL SICKNESSES, THERE'S
[52:48] REAL TRIALS, THERE'S REAL DEVILS, BUT I
[52:50] YOU MAY BE TROUBLED ON EVERY SIDE, YET
[52:53] NOT DISTRESSED.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE GOD THAT'S WITH YOU IS
[52:58] GREATER THAN THE THING THAT OPPOSES YOU.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU MIGHT BE PERPLEXED, BUT NOT IN
[53:05] DESPAIR.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU MIGHT BE PERSECUTED, BUT
[53:09] YOU'RE NOT FORSAKEN.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Somebody just needs to hear
[53:13] THAT TONIGHT. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT FORSAKEN.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT ALONE. YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING
[53:18] THIS BATTLE ALONE. THIS IS THE LORD'S
[53:21] BATTLE. AND HE IS FIGHTING WHEN YOU'RE
[53:23] SLEEPING. HE IS FIGHTING WHEN YOU'RE
[53:25] SINGING. HE IS FIGHTING WHEN YOU'RE
[53:26] RESTING. HE'S WORKING EVEN WHEN YOU
[53:28] DON'T SEE HIM WORKING. HE'S A GOD OF
[53:31] MIRACLES. AND HE'S WORKING A MIRACLE ON
[53:33] YOUR BEHALF. YOU ARE not alone.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Cast down, but I'm not destroyed.
[53:44] Hallelujah. Faith speak. That's the
[53:46] faith. That's a faith language. This is
[53:49] what this is what it is. Yay. Though I
[53:51] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[53:52] death, I'm not going to fear. I don't
[53:54] have to fear. Why? Because there's
[53:56] somebody walking with me that's greater
[53:58] than anything that's in this valley.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[54:06] Thou preparest a table before me in the
[54:08] presence of my enemies.
[54:10] What?
[54:13] &gt;&gt; You can sit down and eat and feast
[54:16] &gt;&gt; right in the presence of your enemies.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; That's quite a p That's a piece right
[54:21] there.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I can walk right into church
[54:25] and I can walk through all kind of
[54:27] trials and tribulations and demons of
[54:29] every kind has been after me and hounded
[54:31] me and I can sit down and he's prepared
[54:33] me a table
[54:35] &gt;&gt; and I can enjoy and I can eat and I can
[54:37] mince and I can eat. I I can feast on
[54:39] the things of God right around me.
[54:41] Enemies are hovering around and saying,
[54:43] "You ain't going to do it. You can't
[54:44] make it." They're saying all kind of
[54:46] things in your mind, speaking all kind
[54:47] of things. BUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF
[54:49] IT, I CAN HAVE A FEAST.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; And in me, in the presence of my
[54:55] enemies, thou anointed my head with oil.
[54:57] My cup runth over. Surely goodness and
[55:00] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[55:02] life,
[55:03] &gt;&gt; and I will dwell in the house of the
[55:05] Lord forever.
[55:09] You know, faith says I'm healed
[55:11] even when the body's weak.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Faith says all things are possible when
[55:18] nothing looks possible at all.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Faith, you know, but faith does not deny
[55:25] reality as far as what we go through and
[55:27] what we live in and the world that we're
[55:29] in. But it declares a greater reality.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at the seen. I'm looking
[55:35] to the unseen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's what faith is
[55:37] looking to. The reality is God's
[55:40] promise. See, faith claims it right now.
[55:42] Faith says God said so and it's mine.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter. He say settle. I don't
[55:48] care if I'm still crippled, if I'm still
[55:50] blind, if I'm still sick, it has nothing
[55:53] to do with it at all.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Hello. Has nothing to do with it all.
[55:59] Can you imagine an enemy that gets so
[56:01] upset that he really has nothing to do
[56:02] with it at all?
[56:06] He tries all he can to try to come and
[56:08] discourage you, to make you quit, and he
[56:10] really has nothing to do. He don't
[56:12] matter.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Let's Let's put it on really who it
[56:17] really belongs on. It ain't you that
[56:19] don't matter. It's the enemy that don't
[56:21] matter.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because his word is what matters.
[56:25] If I'm still blind, if I'm still sick,
[56:27] doesn't have nothing to do with it all.
[56:29] I believe God's word anyhow. It's mine
[56:31] right now.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have THE 25 CENTS. IT'S MINE
[56:35] RIGHT NOW.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID SO AND THAT SETTLES IT. THAT'S
[56:39] FAITH. HOPE SAYS God said so and I'm
[56:42] expecting TO GET IT SOMEDAY. Maybe
[56:45] someday.
[56:46] As long AS SATAN CAN PUT YOU OFF TO
[56:48] ANOTHER DAY, THAT'S AS GOOD AS HE WANTS.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm not interested IN A
[56:56] GOSPEL. AMEN. THAT PUTS GOD IN ANOTHER
[56:58] day or another time or another. I NEED
[57:00] HIM IN MY TIME SLOT.
[57:03] I DON'T NEED HEALING in another day. I
[57:05] NEED IT IN THIS DAY.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; I don't need deliverance IN ANOTHER DAY.
[57:10] I NEED IT RIGHT NOW.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; But if Satan can put you off to another
[57:18] day, that's as good as he wants. You'll
[57:20] never get there. It's like the carrot in
[57:22] front of the cat in front of the horse,
[57:23] you know, going down. Just keeps
[57:25] following it but never getting there.
[57:30] It's your personal property. Faith is
[57:33] the substance of things hoped for, the
[57:35] evidence of things not seen. Faith acts
[57:38] now. It's positive.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Sickness, listen. Sickness a and
[57:43] everything else. When faith steps in,
[57:45] it's like snowball on a hot stove. It
[57:48] just melts away.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; It don't matter.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Everything goes away from faith because
[57:54] faith stands up and takes rule. When
[57:56] faith speaks, everything else keeps
[57:58] still. That's right. The little old
[58:00] sickness burning around and saying
[58:02] things like, "Well, days of miracles are
[58:03] passed." This or that. BUT LET FAITH
[58:05] STEP UP ONE TIME AND PULL THE MUSCLES UP
[58:08] AND SAY, "I'LL TAKE OVER." I TELL YOU
[58:10] WHAT, WHEN FAITH DOES THAT, EVERYTHING
[58:12] ELSE MOVES AWAY.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WHEN FAITH STEPS UP, CANCER
[58:16] MELTS AWAY. WHEN FAITH STEPS UP, ALIPCIA
[58:19] MELTS AWAY. WHEN FAITH STEPS UP, BRAIN
[58:21] BLEEDS TO MELT AWAY.
[58:25] FAITH.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; And it goes the same with salvation.
[58:30] Brother Brandham teaches it this way. He
[58:32] said, "Every one of you, God saved the
[58:34] same way by faith."
[58:37] &gt;&gt; You're saved by by your faith.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; That's why I can't tell you that you're
[58:43] saved. You have to have your own
[58:44] revelation you're saved.
[58:48] You can come here and cry and pray and
[58:50] pray and cry a week, next week, a month,
[58:52] and you'll still be a sinner until you
[58:54] accept him by faith.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Is that right? It's not your crying that
[59:01] saves you.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; It's your faith that saves you.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; That's when you accept it. You believe
[59:07] it. Somebody said, "Well, let let's see
[59:08] if you look any different." Why? You
[59:10] still got brown eyes. You're still just
[59:12] the same as you was. You can't show
[59:13] nothing that you're saved, but you only
[59:15] testify of the unseen. Your faith says
[59:18] you're saved. You believe you're saved,
[59:20] then you say you're saved, then you act
[59:22] like you're saved, AND YOU ASSOCIATE
[59:23] WITH THOSE THAT ARE SAVED. IT WORKS
[59:25] RIGHTEOUSNESS. IS THAT RIGHT? AFTER A
[59:26] WHILE, EVERYBODY WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE
[59:28] SAVED.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; But it ain't it ain't on how much you
[59:36] cry or how much you, you know, lay at at
[59:39] an altar. No, it is. It is. Sure.
[59:41] There's you need to repent and make
[59:43] things right. But once those things are
[59:45] done, you need to accept God's
[59:46] forgiveness for you.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; That's the problem with a lot of people.
[59:50] They can't accept God forgave them.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; And many times they really just can't
[59:54] forgive themselves.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. We got to we got to
[59:58] accept God's forgiven me. I am a
[1:00:00] forgiven son. I am a forgiven daughter.
[1:00:03] I I've asked God to forgive me. We heard
[1:00:05] it Sunday and it ain't he don't fish in
[1:00:06] that pond no more. Listen, it ain't God
[1:00:08] reaching in there and picking up that
[1:00:10] guilt from 10 years ago and bringing it
[1:00:11] dangling OVER YOUR FACE. HE'S NOT THAT
[1:00:13] KIND OF GOD.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; HE DON'T EVEN REMEMBER IT no more.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE DEVIL THAT'S DOING YOU THAT
[1:00:19] WAY.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; But when you've asked God to forgive and
[1:00:23] you made a real real repentance and
[1:00:25] you've laid it all out there to him.
[1:00:27] Listen, it it ain't it ain't it it ain't
[1:00:29] like we're not a bunch of Catholics
[1:00:31] WHERE WE GOT TO CRAWL SO FAR AND WE GOT
[1:00:32] TO CRY SO MUCH AND WE GOT TO DO
[1:00:34] SOMETHING THOUGH. WE GOT TO ACCEPT WHAT
[1:00:36] GOD HAS ALREADY done for us. Amen.
[1:00:44] I always love the example brother
[1:00:46] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:00:46] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:00:46] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:00:46] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:00:46] brother uh John Andy's used at camp
[1:00:50] that was on tape there of a woman or man
[1:00:52] I can't remember there's in a prayer
[1:00:53] line or there was just a prayer line
[1:00:55] taking place and brother Brandham says
[1:00:57] now if you have anything in your life
[1:01:00] he said step out of the line make it
[1:01:03] right and get back in the line
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; that's it
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; right
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; it was like what 10 seconds at most
[1:01:10] maybe life. So just just what he said,
[1:01:13] get get out of the line, make it right,
[1:01:15] get back in the line. He didn't say get
[1:01:17] out of line, go back to your seat, and
[1:01:19] until you feel worthy enough, then come
[1:01:20] up here. He said, no, get out of the
[1:01:22] line, make it right, get back in line.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. IT'S ACCEPTING WHAT
[1:01:29] GOD'S DONE FOR YOU.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, HE CAN FORGIVE YOU SO QUICKLY.
[1:01:34] IT DOESN'T TAKE HOURS AND AND MONTHS AND
[1:01:37] WEEKS and years. It ain't about that.
[1:01:39] It's about ASKING GOD TO FORGIVE YOU AND
[1:01:42] MAKING IT RIGHT and then then it's over
[1:01:44] with.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Right, Sister Genie? SHE WAS THERE IN
[1:01:47] THE PRAYER LIFE. SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT
[1:01:49] IT'S LIKE. LISTEN, WHEN WHEN SHE ASKED
[1:01:51] GOD TO FORGIVE HER AND TO MAKE IT RIGHT,
[1:01:53] EVEN THE PROPHET OF GOD COULD NOT BRING
[1:01:55] IT OUT FROM UNDER THAT BLOOD.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF A PROPHET CAN'T BRING IT
[1:02:01] OUT, WHY ARE WE FISHING IN IT? WHY ARE
[1:02:03] WE LOOKING AROUND? WHY ARE WE STILL
[1:02:05] CARRYING ON OUR OWN PAST AND OWN
[1:02:07] MISTAKES AND OUR OWN FAILURE? IT'S TIME
[1:02:09] TO ACCEPT WHAT GOD [screaming] HAS DONE
[1:02:11] FOR ME AND BEGIN TO SPEAK, I AM SAVED.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; I'M DELIVERED. I'M SET FREE. I DON'T I
[1:02:19] DON'T HAVE TO BE BOUND ANYMORE. I DON'T
[1:02:21] HAVE TO BOW DOWN TO WHAT SATAN SAYS. I
[1:02:23] DON'T HAVE TO BOW DOWN TO HIS
[1:02:24] CONDEMNATION.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; When we confessed our sin and we met
[1:02:31] God's requirement that he requires, we
[1:02:34] believe on God, there's circumstances
[1:02:35] have to be met. is according to his
[1:02:38] will. We confessed our sins. We made all
[1:02:40] wrongs that we did have right. Done
[1:02:42] everything we know to do. Every
[1:02:44] requirement that God has made or has. We
[1:02:45] met that requirement and sometimes yet
[1:02:48] he lays silent.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he just won't answer us. He
[1:02:54] said, I'm sure I'm speaking to people
[1:02:56] this morning who's come to that place.
[1:02:58] He said, I've been there many times
[1:02:59] myself. When I walk I went back and I
[1:03:02] went back and I traced my life. I turned
[1:03:03] over every stone. uh find if I did
[1:03:05] something wrong, I'd go confess it and
[1:03:07] say, "Lord God, I make this right and go
[1:03:08] do so." And then come back again, say,
[1:03:10] "Lord God, thou art God. You'll answer
[1:03:12] me. Surely I met the request
[1:03:14] requirement. Every requirement I've met
[1:03:15] and still he doesn't move seems to be
[1:03:18] silent." That's when you got to be sure
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; he's God.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged. The only thing is
[1:03:26] that in your heart to be certain of God.
[1:03:28] Be certain in your heart that is he's
[1:03:30] God and he's a he's a rewarder of those
[1:03:33] who diligently seek him. And when you
[1:03:35] met everything he said then you're sure
[1:03:37] that he's God. That when YOUR FAITH
[1:03:39] THAT'S WHEN FAITH GOES to work right
[1:03:40] there. Faith stands steady for it knows
[1:03:43] that God is.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER IF I'M SICK, GOD IS.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; IF I DON'T HAVE A DIME, GOD IS.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; IF I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS, GOD IS. BUT
[1:03:55] I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TO TURN. MY
[1:03:57] NEXT TURN, GOD IS.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; And you met everything he said, then
[1:04:03] you're sure he's God. And faith goes to
[1:04:04] work. Faith stands steady for it knows
[1:04:06] that he is. You met every requirement.
[1:04:08] You believe that he is. Faith holds
[1:04:10] steady and bless his holy name. Faith
[1:04:12] won't move for sure that God is and he's
[1:04:15] a rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:04:17] him. He said, "May this go down deep and
[1:04:20] never move from you." If you've ever met
[1:04:22] God's requirement and in your heart you
[1:04:24] believe that he is God's only testing
[1:04:27] your faith for he loves to do that.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; You've confessed your sin. YOU MET A
[1:04:33] REQUIREMENT THAT GOD REQUIRES AND STILL
[1:04:35] HE LAYS SILENT. REMEMBER FAITH SAYS THAT
[1:04:38] HE IS. THEN FAITH HOLDS ON TO IT NOT
[1:04:40] KNOWING WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT OR HOW IT'S
[1:04:43] GOING TO BE. IT JUST KNOWS HE IS.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; And he's certain that he's God.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. and his words are true and
[1:04:52] required you to meet these circumstances
[1:04:54] and you did, he's obligated to take care
[1:04:57] of his word.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "If one man comes and meets the
[1:05:04] requirements and God heals him, then
[1:05:06] God's obligated to you if you meet the
[1:05:08] same requirements."
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Right? That's what faith says.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; His word is true.
[1:05:17] He's obligated. Don't back off and say,
[1:05:21] "I never got healed."
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; That's not faith speech.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; That's not the language of faith.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Faith says, "I already was healed."
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years ago, the price was paid.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; It's already done. Amen.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talks about he said,
[1:05:43] "Some people thought that when I, you
[1:05:45] know, when he was having that sickness
[1:05:46] and that stomach problems and he was
[1:05:48] going around, he ate that big mess of
[1:05:50] beans and and onions and the doctor said
[1:05:52] if he ate another mess, it was going to
[1:05:53] kill him." And he said, "What?" His mom
[1:05:54] asked him what he wanted for supper. He
[1:05:56] said, "I want some beans and I want some
[1:05:57] onions." Said, "Well, Billy, you know,
[1:05:58] the doctor said it's going to kill you."
[1:05:59] He said, "Well, I I'm not living by what
[1:06:01] the doctor said. I'm living by what the
[1:06:03] word of God says." And he took a he took
[1:06:05] a bite of them things. He said it went
[1:06:07] down and begin to burn in his stomach.
[1:06:08] And he took another bite and it began to
[1:06:10] burn and started belching up. Started
[1:06:12] coming. He ran out. Started holding it
[1:06:13] down. Thank God for healing me. And it
[1:06:16] was all trying to come up. Thank God for
[1:06:18] healing me. He said, "Brother brother
[1:06:19] Brandham, ain't you making a reproach on
[1:06:21] God and his word? You're lying saying
[1:06:23] you're healed and you're you're you're
[1:06:24] just as sick as you ever were." He said,
[1:06:26] "Listen, I wasn't confessing my
[1:06:28] feelings.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; I WASN'T CONFESSING HOW I FELT. THAT
[1:06:34] WASN'T WHAT I WAS CONFESSING. I WAS
[1:06:36] CONFESSING THE WORD OF GOD. BY
[1:06:38] [screaming] HIS STRIPES, I'M HEALED.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE LANGUAGE OF FAITH.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't never back up and say,
[1:06:54] "I never got healed."
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Even if your symptoms get worse,
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Don't ever back up and say, "God didn't
[1:07:02] deliver me." Even if it gets worse.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:05] Don't ever back up and say God didn't do
[1:07:07] anything. Even if it gets worse.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Oh, you do that, you
[1:07:12] poor weak faith." Don't believe that. If
[1:07:15] everything's confessed, everything's
[1:07:16] out, you got you met God's requirement,
[1:07:18] faith will hold. There's nothing to move
[1:07:20] it. They that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:07:22] renew their strength. They shall mount
[1:07:24] up with wings of an eagle. They shall
[1:07:26] run and not be weary. If they walk, they
[1:07:28] shall not faint. Wait when YOU MET HIS
[1:07:30] REQUIREMENTS. WAIT.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; You might have to WAIT A MONTH. YOU
[1:07:36] MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR. WAIT.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE WORTH IT.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; WAIT. THAT THAT BRINGS YOUR FAITH TO A
[1:07:43] SHOWDOWN. GOD'S REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN
[1:07:46] MET. YOU HAVE FULLY CONSIDERED IT.
[1:07:48] YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING HE'S REQUIRED.
[1:07:50] THEN YOUR FAITH REST ON HIS WORD. AND
[1:07:52] HIS WORD SAYS HE IS.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; But you know, he loves to test us.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:04] He loves to see the reaction of your
[1:08:07] faith.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to make I'm going to
[1:08:12] be very open here. You most of you know
[1:08:14] it anyhow.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; I come from a long line of pickers,
[1:08:18] jokesters.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Listen. Well, you couldn't go over my
[1:08:22] mama and papa's house without some joke
[1:08:24] breaking out. They would get something
[1:08:26] before you left. They'd throw at you.
[1:08:27] They'd do something. It was what? It was
[1:08:29] always wanting to see your reaction.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You know, I found I found I made I
[1:08:35] should say this. Oh, I always said if I
[1:08:38] don't pick on you, it means I don't like
[1:08:40] you.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; But maybe it just means I ain't got
[1:08:45] around to you yet.
[1:08:49] But what what is it? What is it? It's
[1:08:50] cuz you want to see a reaction.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I had some sisters, you know, and I
[1:08:55] was the only brother. So the Lord G,
[1:08:57] praise God, get made me the oldest. So
[1:08:59] and and so anyway, Lydia and Bethany
[1:09:02] both were good reactors.
[1:09:07] They would you would HAVE TO DO MUCH.
[1:09:10] STOP IT. GOT A LOT OF WHOOPINGS FOR that
[1:09:12] right there. Right. But Esther, you
[1:09:16] could do all kinds of stuff to her and
[1:09:17] she'd just look at you. Well, you know,
[1:09:19] finally I just quit picking on her.
[1:09:20] Wasn't it I didn't like her,
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; but she didn't react.
[1:09:26] And I thought about this BECAUSE BROTHER
[1:09:28] BRANDHAM TALKS about that God likes to
[1:09:30] see how your faith is going to react.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; He wants to see is he GOING TO BACK UP
[1:09:39] AND ARE YOU GOING TO BACK UP AND SAY,
[1:09:40] "WELL, NO, I DIDN'T get healed. No, God
[1:09:43] didn't DO NOTHING. NO, GOD DIDN'T. HE
[1:09:45] DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH." OR IS IT GOING TO
[1:09:46] MOVE FORWARD AND SAY, "GOD is
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; is he GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AND SAY, "MY
[1:09:51] GOD ANSWERED MY PRAYER. IT'S ALREADY
[1:09:54] DONE. IT'S ALREADY FINISHED. GOD LIKES
[1:09:57] TO SEE THE REACTION OF YOUR FAITH.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; NOW, and all that, I'm not saying I'm
[1:10:06] God. All right?
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; But we like to see the reactions. He
[1:10:11] loves to see a reaction.
[1:10:13] He He loves to see a movement. He loves
[1:10:16] to see something happen.
[1:10:19] This is what he said. I I I don't have
[1:10:21] it all before me. But brother Bram talks
[1:10:23] about it a lot of times. He said God
[1:10:25] loves to test you. He loves to bring you
[1:10:28] to a place of testing.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; We don't like those places. We like the
[1:10:32] mountains.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; We all get on the mountain, shout the
[1:10:38] victory, and hear it echo back. Victory,
[1:10:40] victory, victory. Hallelujah.
[1:10:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But it's down in
[1:10:45] those valleys.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; We don't like it.
[1:10:51] It's some dark times and dark places
[1:10:53] sometime, but is is it is the shadow of
[1:10:56] death.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; So that tells you even in a valley
[1:10:59] there's light present.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; You're not alone. You're not you're not
[1:11:04] you're not by yourself. You mean it's a
[1:11:06] shadow there. So it tells you that light
[1:11:08] is present. That there's SOMETHING THERE
[1:11:10] AND IT'S TESTING YOU TO SEE HOW YOU'RE
[1:11:13] GOING TO REACT.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; I mean, there's some people [crying]
[1:11:20] I don't I didn't even really mean to go
[1:11:21] all these directions, but there's some
[1:11:23] people that you can you can just go you
[1:11:25] can just look at them and go boo and
[1:11:27] you'll get the biggest reaction. Just
[1:11:29] flip their lids. And there's some people
[1:11:32] you can set up and you can just get all
[1:11:34] prepared and you can try to set the trap
[1:11:35] and you can jump out with a mask on and
[1:11:37] YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING AND THEY JUST LOOK
[1:11:39] AT YOU,
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:11:46] God is wanting to get us to a place that
[1:11:49] where we're not when the devil goes boo,
[1:11:51] we go,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; but he's wanting TO GET US TO A PLACE
[1:11:55] THAT WHEN WE'RE DOWN IN THE VALLEY AND
[1:11:57] IT'S DARK. A lot of scary places in DARK
[1:12:00] PLACES, RIGHT? IT'S DARK
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL JUMPS OUT WITH CANCER. HE
[1:12:04] JUMPS OUT WITH WHATEVER AND HE GOES
[1:12:08] AND you don't even react. Right.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; You just look at him say, "You don't
[1:12:13] matter because my glory of God says by
[1:12:15] his stripes I'm healed."
[1:12:17] [applause]
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; HE JUMPS OUT AT YOU AND HE SAY, "I'M
[1:12:22] GOING TO TAKE YOUR CHILD." NO, YOU'RE
[1:12:23] NOT GOING TO TAKE MY CHILD CUZ HIS WORD
[1:12:25] SAID THEY SHALL BE THERE AND THEIR
[1:12:27] OFFSPRING WITH THEM.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not going TO REACT TO YOUR CHATTER.
[1:12:32] I'M NOT GOING TO REACT TO YOUR BOOZE.
[1:12:34] MATTER OF FACT, I'M GOING TO GRAB THE
[1:12:36] WORD OF GOD AND I'M GOING TO BOO BACK,
[1:12:38] DEVIL.
[1:12:39] AMEN.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Said this before, but it's worth saying
[1:12:46] again. I've seen this cartoon or some
[1:12:47] something somewhere of a little old
[1:12:50] dorky lamb walking on his hind feet. We
[1:12:53] know they don't do that, but it's a
[1:12:54] cartoon. And he's got his little hoofs
[1:12:56] and he's holding the hands of Jesus. And
[1:12:58] he's walking down this road and there's
[1:13:00] this lion over in a ditch and he's got
[1:13:02] he's just got his mouth wide open. There
[1:13:04] ain't no teeth, but he's got his mouth
[1:13:05] wide open. He's making this big roar.
[1:13:08] And that dorky looking sheep,
[1:13:11] they're walking along with Jesus looking
[1:13:13] at that lion says, "I'm with him."
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Time you remind your devil that's
[1:13:22] tormenting you who you're with. Or
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; maybe who's with you.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; You are not alone. You're not fighting
[1:13:28] this battle alone. Amen. You're you're
[1:13:30] WITH JESUS. IT'S IT'S NOT ME TRYING TO
[1:13:33] OVERCOME CANCER. IT'S JESUS IN ME
[1:13:35] overcoming it.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ME TRYING TO OVERCOME THAT
[1:13:39] WHATEVER SIN. IT'S JESUS IN ME
[1:13:41] OVERCOMING IT.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Trying to get us to where our reaction
[1:13:48] is not backing up. Our reaction is going
[1:13:51] forward. That's right.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Our reaction is stepping out in faith.
[1:13:54] Our reaction is not pulling back and
[1:13:56] getting further in the boat. No, it's
[1:13:58] taking a step and getting out of the
[1:13:59] boat.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, Jesus wasn't He wasn't
[1:14:04] interested in him being the only one
[1:14:06] walking on water.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; He's not interested in him being the
[1:14:12] ONLY ONE THAT CAST out devils.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; As far as a man 2,000 YEARS AGO. NO, HE
[1:14:17] WANTED MANY, MANY MEN, MANY WOMEN. AMEN.
[1:14:20] ARE CHARGED WITH THE HOLY GHOST THAT'LL
[1:14:22] WALK THROUGH SATAN'S HE AND NOT BACK UP
[1:14:25] WHEN HE BOOZE, BUT MOVE OUT IN FAITH AND
[1:14:27] SAY, "THIS IS THE WORD OF GOD, DEVIL.
[1:14:29] BACK OFF.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; FAITH.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; So in our opening scripture, Paul's
[1:14:41] faith was speaking of his purpose,
[1:14:45] why he was here. Yes, he was facing
[1:14:47] trials, but it was for a purpose.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; The purpose of that the purpose of God
[1:14:53] would stand. And even when his purpose
[1:14:56] when God's purpose takes us through
[1:14:57] trials, faith still speaks.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; You know, brother say it like this. He
[1:15:03] said, "Each one of us born for
[1:15:04] something. We just wasn't put here for
[1:15:06] nothing. The mountain never happened out
[1:15:08] there just to be. The tree was put there
[1:15:10] for a purpose. Everything's for a
[1:15:11] purpose. I got to serve. We're here for
[1:15:12] a purpose. Maybe it's to testify just to
[1:15:15] one person and get them saved."
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Well, God would do that. He would have a
[1:15:22] have a man be born upon this earth and
[1:15:24] be filled with the Holy Ghost and he
[1:15:25] could raise up and go through all kinds
[1:15:27] of things in his life just so he could
[1:15:28] testify to one person and be saved.
[1:15:30] Well, Jesus didn't. He went he went
[1:15:32] across the ocean, the the Sea of Galilee
[1:15:35] for one person.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; It wasn't for a big meeting. It was for
[1:15:39] one person. God, he got purposes and
[1:15:41] everything. He said, "Maybe it's to
[1:15:43] testify to one person. Maybe it's to
[1:15:45] come be a preacher who will send million
[1:15:47] souls to Christ." Look at the Dwight
[1:15:48] Moody's conversion. many of those just a
[1:15:51] little woman, little old wash woman with
[1:15:53] a message on her heart to do something
[1:15:54] for God. And she rented an old livery
[1:15:56] stable and got a minister to come down
[1:15:58] and preach. Nobody but a little old boy
[1:16:00] with his hair hanging down his neck and
[1:16:01] his daddy suspenders on went down there,
[1:16:04] but he knelt at the altar that night.
[1:16:05] Dwight Moody has sent half a million
[1:16:07] souls to Jesus Christ. That woman had
[1:16:10] something to do. It was for a purpose.
[1:16:12] She was made a wash woman for A PURPOSE.
[1:16:15] DON'T DESPISE WHERE GOD'S GOT YOU.
[1:16:19] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; CUZ IF YOU DESPISE WHERE GOD'S GOT YOU,
[1:16:24] YOU CANNOT HAVE FAITH IN WHERE YOU'RE
[1:16:26] AT.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; DON'T DESPISE WHERE GOD'S GOT YOU. BUT
[1:16:31] SERVE YOUR PURPOSE. THERE'S COMING A
[1:16:33] GREAT VICTORY DAY ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN
[1:16:35] THE BATTLE IS [screaming] ALL OVER.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; It's for a purpose.
[1:16:51] It It's not me working it on my own.
[1:16:54] It's not you trying to make it on your
[1:16:56] own. It's We can't make it on our own.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in us.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; It's working his will. It's speaking his
[1:17:04] word. Is greater is he that's in you
[1:17:09] than what's around you.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in you than what's
[1:17:14] before you.
[1:17:20] We we're we're not going down in defeat.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; No, this bride is not this bride was not
[1:17:27] made. This Leodysia bride, the overcomer
[1:17:30] of Leodysia,
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; was not made to go back down into the
[1:17:35] earth.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; That was Ephesus.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; They played their part. That's right.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; This bride was not made to go back into
[1:17:43] the earth
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; to die out to per perpetuate another
[1:17:47] church age to another another coming.
[1:17:49] No, this bride
[1:17:52] was made to go up in victory.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; So, we're not going to go up by the skin
[1:17:58] of our teeth or just barely hanging on
[1:18:00] or just barely surviving or just barely,
[1:18:02] you know, just barely making it to
[1:18:04] church or just barely barely barely. No,
[1:18:06] no, no. That's not this bride.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; That's not overcoming. That's right.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Hello. That's not overcoming.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; That's not Oh, to hear to him that
[1:18:17] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:18:19] at my throne even as I also overcame?
[1:18:22] Did Jesus just barely overcome?
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Did he just barely survive? Did he just
[1:18:27] barely make it in his time? Did he just
[1:18:29] bar No, he didn't just barely Nothing.
[1:18:31] He died. Yes, he died, but he also rose
[1:18:34] again. Not only DID HE ALSO RISE AGAIN,
[1:18:37] but he also ascended. Amen. Not only did
[1:18:40] he also send him, BUT HE ALSO CAME BACK.
[1:18:42] THAT WE CAN HAVE THE SAME POWER.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; TO NOT JUST BARELY MAKE IT. NOT JUST
[1:18:47] BARELY SURVIVE. NOT JUST BARELY MAKE IT
[1:18:50] ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT HANGING BY A
[1:18:52] THREAD. NO SIR. THIS BRIDE AIN'T JUST A
[1:18:54] BARELY BRIDE.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE'S AN OVERCOMING BRIDE. SHE'S A
[1:18:59] RIGHTEOUS BRIDE. SHE'S THE BRIDE OF
[1:19:01] JESUS [screaming] CHRIST WITH THE SAME
[1:19:03] POWER WITH THE SAME AUTHORITY WITH THE
[1:19:05] SAME VINDICATION, WITH THE SAME SIGNS,
[1:19:08] WITH THE SAME WONDERS.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU FACE LANGUAGE. I'M NOT
[1:19:13] TALKING ABOUT MY DOUBTS AND MY FEARS. IF
[1:19:15] I WAS GOING TO GET UP AND PREACH DOUBTS
[1:19:17] AND FEARS, I'D PREACH, WELL, I DON'T
[1:19:19] KNOW WHAT'S going to happen. I don't
[1:19:20] know how it's going to be. I don't think
[1:19:22] we got the power anymore. I DON'T KNOW.
[1:19:24] THAT IS NOT WHO I AM.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; OH, that's right.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; No. If you wanted a preacher that'll
[1:19:30] PREACH YOU IN YOUR IN YOUR DOLDRUMS AND
[1:19:32] PREACH TO YOU AND JUST SAY, "OH, YOU'RE
[1:19:34] GOING TO BE OKAY." NO. I'M TELLING YOU,
[1:19:35] YOU GOT A RIGHT TO STEP OUT OF THERE.
[1:19:38] YOU GOT A RIGHT TO LIFT UP. YOU GOT A
[1:19:40] RIGHT TO SAY
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; TO DIE
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; AND PRAISE GOD ANYHOW, NO MATTER WHAT'S
[1:19:46] GOING ON AROUND YOU.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Because it ain't me, it's him that's
[1:19:53] working in me.
[1:20:01] It says, "He that is in you is greater
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world."
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Greater is not equal.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Of course, it's not lesser. It's
[1:20:14] greater.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; It's not barely.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; It's God in you like he was in Jesus
[1:20:24] Christ.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:27] like he was in Jesus Christ.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Well, what did he do in Jesus Christ? He
[1:20:32] overcame.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; He cast out devils.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; He healed the sick.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; He saved the lost.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; He died, but he rose again.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Is G. Is God in you as he was in Jesus
[1:20:50] Christ? So don't come give me some
[1:20:52] melted down ice cream cone of a message.
[1:20:55] that says he's not the same today and he
[1:20:57] ain't got the same power of vindication,
[1:20:59] same signs and wonders. You lying
[1:21:01] hypocrite.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; You wolf in sheep's clothing is what you
[1:21:06] are. This this B this this this word
[1:21:08] says he is as he WAS IN JESUS CHRIST. SO
[1:21:11] IS HE IN THE BRIDE.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; COME ON SOMEBODY. SO IT AIN'T JUST
[1:21:17] BARELY OVERCOMING. IT ISN'T OVERCOMING
[1:21:20] BY OUR MIND'S ABILITY OR SOME
[1:21:21] INTELLECTUAL ABILITY. IS OVERCOMING BY
[1:21:24] THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in you than he
[1:21:29] that's in the world.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; All he poured into Christ and all Christ
[1:21:36] was, he poured into the church.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; And somehow we get that we're just going
[1:21:43] to barely make it.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; No, we ain't going to barely make
[1:21:46] nothing.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; We're going to knock the gates of hell
[1:21:49] down.
[1:21:51] That's right.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; I wished I had some of those speeches
[1:21:58] brother Aaron's so good at using because
[1:22:04] I I got to use that one over there at
[1:22:06] the Alamo. If I could maybe I just get
[1:22:07] you up here and just tell it.
[1:22:10] I heard your voice.
[1:22:14] When all those Mexicans surrounded
[1:22:18] the Alamo sent this unconditional
[1:22:20] surrender note
[1:22:23] to Colonel Travis, I get that right. He
[1:22:25] said, "I responded with a cannon shot."
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; That sends vibes all the way down
[1:22:33] through this southern body.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; It's time some of us look at that devil
[1:22:38] and he wants to send some surrender note
[1:22:40] to you.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Time you respond with a cannon shot.
[1:22:44] Yes,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; I'm responding with faith. How about
[1:22:47] that, boy?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; I'm responding with the word of God. How
[1:22:51] about that, DEVIL? I'M RESPONDING NOT
[1:22:53] WITH MY FEELINGS, not with what I think,
[1:22:55] not with what I'm looking at. Amen.
[1:22:57] Colonel Travis had a lot to look at. He
[1:22:59] had a lot of problems. IT DIDN'T LOOK
[1:23:00] LIKE MUCH HOPE, BUT HE WASN'T LOOKING AT
[1:23:02] HIS HOPE. HE WAS LOOKING AT WHAT WAS
[1:23:04] BEHIND HIM.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. IT'S TIME WE QUIT
[1:23:10] LOOKING AT WHAT WE CAN SEE AND WE START
[1:23:12] LOOKING TO THE UNSEEN.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Timothy, you
[1:23:17] said there was a lot of devils here. YOU
[1:23:18] SAID THERE'S FOLLOWING." YEAH, BUT AIN'T
[1:23:20] THAT AIN'T ALL THE STORY THERE. THERE'S
[1:23:22] MORE OF THAT THAT'S FOR US THAN THERE is
[1:23:24] against us.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The devil can have a
[1:23:29] thousand, but as LONG AS GOD'S GOT A
[1:23:30] THOUSAND IN ONE, GREATER IS HE THAT'S IN
[1:23:32] us than he that's in the world. And no
[1:23:34] matter how many DEMONS THE DEVIL HAS,
[1:23:36] GOD'S GOT MORE ANGELS.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; No matter HOW MUCH POWER THE DEVIL HAS,
[1:23:41] GOD'S GOT MORE POWER. NO MATTER MUCH HOW
[1:23:43] MUCH HOLDING THE DEVIL CAN DO, GOD'S GOT
[1:23:46] MORE POWER TO BREAK THE HOLD OF SATAN.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW MUCH SICKNESS THAT HE CAN
[1:23:50] POUR OUT IN THIS GENERATION, GOD'S GOT
[1:23:53] ENOUGH HEALING.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW MUCH DEPRESSION HE CAN
[1:23:56] POUR ON YOU, GOD'S GOT ENOUGH JOY
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; that'll take THAT OLD FROWNY LIP AND
[1:24:02] TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN. AND YOU CAN START
[1:24:04] SHOUTING THE PRAISES OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Because greater is he that's in you.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; I don't think it said in the preachers.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Is that what it said in the preachers? I
[1:24:20] did. I mean, no. It said, "Greater is he
[1:24:22] that is in you."
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; How many you use we got?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; I'm a you. Yes.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz all that God was, he poured into
[1:24:34] Christ.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; And all that Christ was, he poured into
[1:24:38] the church.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; That's God in you.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; He that's in you.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; I don't think we grasp that enough. I I
[1:24:47] just want to keep saying until somebody
[1:24:48] just says, "Amen. That's me."
[1:24:52] [laughter]
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's you.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:24:57] AND ALL THAT CHRIST WAS, HE POURED INTO
[1:25:00] THE CHURCH. THAT'S GOD in you. He that's
[1:25:03] in you. He said, "No wonder winds and
[1:25:05] waves obeyed him. Obeyed his word.
[1:25:07] Obeyed his words." BECAUSE THAT WAS
[1:25:09] GOD'S word speaking through him. HE WAS
[1:25:11] A MAN, BUT HE WAS THE WORD MADE FLESH.
[1:25:13] AND WHEN HE SPOKE, THAT WAS GOD SPEAKING
[1:25:15] THROUGH HUMAN LIPS.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; No wonder the w winds and waves ceased.
[1:25:20] The very creator that created the winds
[1:25:22] and waves. Now, THINK OF THAT. NO WONDER
[1:25:24] DEMONS WERE PARALYZED AT HIS WORDS.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; PARALYZED.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Do you UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S ENOUGH
[1:25:35] POWER IN YOU TO PARALYZE DEMONS?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND? THERE'S ENOUGH POWER
[1:25:41] IN THIS CHURCH THAT HAVE PARALYZED
[1:25:43] DEMONS. WE'VE SEEN it happen. WE'VE SEEN
[1:25:46] IT TAKE PLACE. THEY COME OUT
[1:25:47] MANIFESTATIONS. I'M GOING TO STRIKE YOU.
[1:25:49] I'M GOING TO HIT YOU AND CAN'T GET TO
[1:25:51] YOU. WHY? CUZ GREATER IS HE THAT'S IN
[1:25:53] YOU than he that's in that devil.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; No wonder
[1:26:03] paralyzing faith. But one of the dead
[1:26:06] was turning back to dust but couldn't
[1:26:09] lay there when his word spoke for he was
[1:26:11] the word.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; He said to Lazarus after being dead
[1:26:15] sinking four days. His nose and face
[1:26:17] fell in much time. Lazarus come forth
[1:26:23] and a man dead raised up on his feet.
[1:26:26] Why? It was God.
[1:26:29] He w he that was in Christ was God. The
[1:26:32] dead could not stand in his presence. It
[1:26:34] was God in Christ.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Remember, God created the winds, the
[1:26:39] air, the waves, the water. But when a
[1:26:41] devil gets into it, he got the tumbling
[1:26:43] to bring destruction. God created man to
[1:26:45] be sons of God. And when the devil gets
[1:26:47] into them, it's trouble. He say that's
[1:26:49] what the devil got in those winds and
[1:26:50] sent a storm. Couldn't the creator that
[1:26:52] created the wind say, "Go back for I
[1:26:54] created you." Isn't that the same
[1:26:56] creator was standing on top of the hill
[1:26:57] the other day? Isn't that the same one
[1:26:58] that spoke to storms?
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Is that same one that would take a piece
[1:27:02] of fish and break it and piece grow
[1:27:04] another piece grow on it? All that was
[1:27:07] in God, he poured into Christ. And all
[1:27:08] that Christ has poured in his bride.
[1:27:10] Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't actually have to have that. He
[1:27:14] could have said, "Isn't that the same
[1:27:16] creature creator that created squirrels?
[1:27:19] He that was in Christ is in us."
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Do we understand what this faith can do?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; He that was in Christ is in us, for it
[1:27:34] does the same works he did.
[1:27:40] How does anybody get away from this and
[1:27:42] say that we don't we don't need that
[1:27:44] anymore?
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Well, if you don't need that no more,
[1:27:47] you don't need Christ no more.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; You went outside him.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Went into some theology of your own
[1:27:55] making, your own dreams.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; You need him.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Without him, we are lost.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Without him, we have no power
[1:28:05] whatsoever.
[1:28:07] Without him, we have no authority
[1:28:08] whatsoever. But with him,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; all things are possible.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; The dead could not stand in his
[1:28:17] presence.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; He says, see, and brother Brown brings
[1:28:24] it in his our day. He talk about dead
[1:28:26] people that have risen and visions and
[1:28:28] so forth. And here sits one right here.
[1:28:31] Dead right here where he was sitting.
[1:28:32] He's alive now. Fell on a heart attack.
[1:28:34] Where's his wife? A nurse. went down,
[1:28:36] brother way. He was talking about
[1:28:38] everything was gone, his eyes set and
[1:28:39] gone. He But now he's alive. Well, God
[1:28:41] still does that in this day.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And anybody, any devil that wants to say
[1:28:46] otherwise, I defy him. I don't care if
[1:28:48] he's speaking out of a man's lips.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; I defy him because God still does them
[1:28:53] things today.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Greater is he. It's God the creator. The
[1:29:00] winds and the waves had to obey him.
[1:29:01] Demons become paralyzed. All nature
[1:29:03] obeys him because he's the creator of
[1:29:05] nature. When we think it takes the bite
[1:29:07] out of it, don't it? When we think like
[1:29:09] that, it takes the bite out, don't it?
[1:29:11] When we think like that, it takes the
[1:29:13] bite out, don't it?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; When we begin then to think of how much
[1:29:16] power that is in Christ has been poured
[1:29:19] into the bride. It takes the bite out of
[1:29:21] Satan's bark.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Because faith begins to rise. Faith
[1:29:26] begins to speak. Faith begins to step
[1:29:28] forward. For he that's in you is greater
[1:29:31] than he that's in the world. HE THAT CAN
[1:29:33] CAUSE A TURMOIL in your life. He that he
[1:29:36] that's in the world, HE THAT HE THAT'S
[1:29:38] IN YOU IS GREATER BECAUSE HE CAN CAUSE
[1:29:40] THAT TURMOIL TO BE AT PEACE.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; I've seen it happen. A man so tormented
[1:29:52] by spirit and another man by the
[1:29:54] uncction of the Holy Ghost say I speak
[1:29:56] peace
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; in this day
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; cuz the greater is he that's in you.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; This is faith language.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't feel so great. It ain't
[1:30:12] about how you feel.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; I didn't feel like coming to preach
[1:30:16] tonight.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; I texted a couple friends. I said, "You
[1:30:20] know, do y'all ever have this feeling?
[1:30:21] You don't feel just don't want to." They
[1:30:24] said, "All the time." I said, "Good. At
[1:30:25] least I ain't in the boat by myself."
[1:30:28] Sometimes you just don't want to.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; But faith begins to speak.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Faith grabs a hold of your tithes, puts
[1:30:35] it around your neck, and say, "Come on,
[1:30:36] boy. We're going to church."
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Faith gets you out of your bed. It'll
[1:30:41] get you out of your out of your couch.
[1:30:43] It'll say, "You know what? Tonight's
[1:30:44] Wednesday night. I I got something there
[1:30:46] at the house. I got a feast to go to.
[1:30:48] He's got me a table prepared in the
[1:30:50] presence of my enemies. I got enemies
[1:30:52] all around me, but I also got a table
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; that I can gain strength that I can
[1:30:58] receive. Cuz greater is he that's in me
[1:31:00] than he that's in the world.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; He that was in Christ
[1:31:07] is greater than he that's in the world.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; But let's don't leave it there.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; He that's in you.
[1:31:19] faith.
[1:31:21] I don't have time to get to all this.
[1:31:24] That's a good one to go listen to.
[1:31:26] Greater is he.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; It's a or he that's in you. It's a great
[1:31:32] faith sermon.
[1:31:34] But I want to bring it down to this. We
[1:31:36] have the devil's answer.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; It's not me that liveth, but Christ the
[1:31:42] word that's living on me in me.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; It's not my idea. It's his power. It's
[1:31:48] not my idea. It's his word. He promised
[1:31:50] it. It is. He is. He is here. He said it
[1:31:53] would be here. Here it is. We've got the
[1:31:55] answer. Christ is risen. He has paid the
[1:31:57] price for my redemption. What God in
[1:31:59] Christ manifested. He gave that flesh
[1:32:01] and blood and blood might become the
[1:32:03] life and the flesh be redeemed. That God
[1:32:05] in this redeemed flesh could manifest
[1:32:07] his word for the day he did in that for
[1:32:09] the day that he did in that day. Woo!
[1:32:11] Glory. You see it? Oh my. Where can I
[1:32:13] stop? Notice it. When we stand justified
[1:32:15] in the presence of God as a drop of ink
[1:32:18] dropping into the tub of bleach, you'd
[1:32:20] never find a stain of it nowhere. IT
[1:32:21] WENT SOMEWHERE, BUT IT'S GONE. AND A man
[1:32:24] that's TRULY REDEEMED. HIS SINS ARE
[1:32:26] DEMOLISHED. IT'S GONE. YOU'RE SEPARATED
[1:32:28] FROM IT FOREVER MORE. IT'S DROPPED IN
[1:32:31] THE INK OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST AND
[1:32:33] IT'S NEVER TO BE REMEMBERED. GOD FORGETS
[1:32:35] IT. HE STANDS. WE HAVE SATAN'S ANSWER.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS VINDICATED HIMSELF. GOD HAS
[1:32:42] PROVED THAT HE HAS A PROMISE IN THIS
[1:32:44] DAY. His headship IS HERE. WHO? CHRIST,
[1:32:47] THE RISEN WORD. BUT IT'S NOT JUST A
[1:32:49] HEAD. THERE IS ALSO THE BODY.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is the devil's answer.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Live voices.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Live voices.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; A God manifested in his people.
[1:33:10] That's the reason he says that a husband
[1:33:13] and wife is no longer twain. They're
[1:33:14] one. God and his church is now one. It's
[1:33:16] Christ and you. God's great revelation.
[1:33:19] Even buried his name. His name is Jesus
[1:33:21] the anointed. The reason he calls he's
[1:33:24] called Jesus, he is the anointed. What
[1:33:27] does he call us? Miss Jesus Christ.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Misanointed.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; So if you want to take the anointing,
[1:33:36] you're not taking the name. If you want
[1:33:39] to take it away, you're not taking the
[1:33:40] name.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; You're taking the name of some ideology
[1:33:43] that you have or some thought that you
[1:33:45] have or some thing or some thinking,
[1:33:47] some whatever you got. Take the name,
[1:33:51] Miss Jesus Christ.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Anointed. Anointed with signs and
[1:33:56] wonders and powers and glories and
[1:33:58] things of God that's manifest. Why?
[1:34:00] Because there's a people who faith is
[1:34:03] found in
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; and they're not in their doubts and
[1:34:07] their unbelief and shrinking back and
[1:34:09] saying, "Well, he used to do that then,
[1:34:11] but he don't do that now." No, no. We're
[1:34:13] stepping forward and saying he's the
[1:34:14] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; I think it's a shame that brother
[1:34:19] Brandham fought so hard against Goliath,
[1:34:21] that Goliath, and killed him and held
[1:34:24] his head up. And now men are now going
[1:34:27] right back to that same point and saying
[1:34:29] the same things that brother Brandham
[1:34:30] fought against.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Where's the mighty men of David?
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; So there's more giants, but that giant's
[1:34:39] got my name on it.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; And I have been chosen to fight him.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to fight him by might
[1:34:45] or by my own strength, but by the power
[1:34:47] of almighty God.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; The faith has been established in my
[1:34:51] heart by the spirit of God that's come
[1:34:52] and been born on the inside of me. that
[1:34:54] it's not my strength or my abilities or
[1:34:56] what I've done or what I will do. It's
[1:34:58] what he's already done.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Let's stand our feet.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; You are Satan's answer.
[1:35:14] Oh, I got so many questions. Questions?
[1:35:16] I got answers. I'm Satan's answer.
[1:35:27] You girls are Satan's answer for what
[1:35:30] God is in this generation.
[1:35:32] He wants to come with all kind of
[1:35:34] questions. You men are Satan's answer
[1:35:36] for what real men are in this
[1:35:37] generation. He comes with all kind of
[1:35:40] question. Question man masculinity.
[1:35:42] Question femininity. Question question.
[1:35:44] We are Satan's answer.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; What God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:35:51] what Christ was. He poured into his
[1:35:52] church.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Miss Jesus Christ.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; It's by our hearts today.
[1:35:59] Now we stand justified
[1:36:04] in Christ
[1:36:07] already judged because he passed the
[1:36:10] judgment hall.
[1:36:16] Justified in his sight. We are his
[1:36:18] victory. The church is his victory.
[1:36:24] Maybe you just need to say that to let
[1:36:26] faith speak. [music] I am his victory.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; I will not be a skin tacked on the wall
[1:36:34] of Satan
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; and his hall of fame of how he overcame
[1:36:38] this one and he did. No, no, that's not
[1:36:40] who I am. I am Christ's victory.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; The faith that overcomes the world.
[1:36:49] The body of Christ living, standing,
[1:36:51] redeemed, [music]
[1:36:53] justified in his sight. We are his
[1:36:55] victory. This church, the church is his
[1:36:58] victory.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; We come forth in the last days with his
[1:37:01] glorious gospel showing his victory that
[1:37:04] he died for a purpose and I was that
[1:37:07] purpose.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; And we are proof of his victory.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; PROOF OF HIS VICTORY. NOT OF HIS DEFEAT,
[1:37:16] of his victory.
[1:37:21] Hallelujah. Father,
[1:37:26] we love you, Lord, with all of our
[1:37:27] hearts.
[1:37:29] Lord, let faith speak out of our lives.
[1:37:33] Satan wants to come with his doubts and
[1:37:34] his unbelief,
[1:37:37] fears and [music] worries.
[1:37:39] Go through a lot of valleys and shadows
[1:37:41] and darkness.
[1:37:43] Lord, many times they just want to see
[1:37:45] our reaction.
[1:37:48] to see how we're going to move. How we
[1:37:50] going to move in this situation? What we
[1:37:52] going to do? We're going to pull back or
[1:37:53] we're going to push forward.
[1:37:56] May we push forward in Jesus name.
[1:38:00] Jesus name. We love you, Father, with
[1:38:03] all of our heart.
[1:38:06] We praise you, Lord. We magnify your
[1:38:08] name. Lord, if there be anybody here
[1:38:10] tonight, Lord, that just wants to say,
[1:38:12] "Father, I want just make everything
[1:38:13] right. Give it to you Lord. uh just want
[1:38:17] to stand [music] justified and freely
[1:38:19] forgiven, redeemed by the blood of the
[1:38:21] lamb. I
[1:38:23] I'm tired of the the doubts and the
[1:38:25] fears taking their place in my life. I
[1:38:27] want to start speaking [music] faith in
[1:38:29] the language of faith. And when you
[1:38:31] return, I want you to find me faithful.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Oh God, so many have walked away from
[1:38:38] the faith. So many have denied it. So
[1:38:39] many have said, "It ain't so." But Lord,
[1:38:42] when you return, I believe you're going
[1:38:43] to find a church, a bride, because your
[1:38:46] word said without [music] spot, without
[1:38:47] wrinkle, you're going to find faith. A
[1:38:50] people believing in a body change.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; A people believing in a rapture. Doesn't
[1:38:56] matter how many people stand up and
[1:38:57] [music] say it ain't so. Your word says
[1:38:59] it's so.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Your prophet says it's so.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; So I believe it. We love you, Father,
[1:39:06] with all of our hearts.
