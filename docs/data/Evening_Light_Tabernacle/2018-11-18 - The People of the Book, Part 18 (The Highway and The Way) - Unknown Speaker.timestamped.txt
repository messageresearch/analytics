[4:23] here they are amen what a blessing it is
[4:26] today to be able to hold this little one
[4:30] I meant to present it to the Lord I feel
[4:32] this is a very special moment when we
[4:36] think about our Lord who said to allow a
[4:39] little children to come to him and
[4:41] forbid them not and he brought them they
[4:44] brought them to him and he blessed them
[4:46] and today we want to bless this child in
[4:49] his stead or in his name and so we're
[4:53] here to represent him and how wonderful
[4:56] it is we can hold these little ones son
[4:59] and give them to the God who gave them
[5:03] to us and say Lord we need a lot of help
[5:06] in this time because we're not able to
[5:08] do this all by ourselves but we need
[5:11] your help and so we want your help and
[5:16] your your guidance and and direction for
[5:20] our lives we got here a little emmalin

[5:34] Lord to keep her and keep her safe and
[5:36] her not heard her name he's got a
[5:39] special meaning you know I'm not certain
[5:43] on every definition of ever name as far
[5:47] as what men say but I understand her
[5:52] name means as emmalin mean hard-working
[5:55] and then Jane meaning God is gracious
[6:00] and I Java is gracious and we we serve a
[6:04] gracious God and man the Lord is
[6:08] gracious and merciful and abounding in
[6:12] love a man and this is what he would say
[6:16] in sums 145 and 8 God's a God that
[6:19] abounds in love and mercy and grace and
[6:22] when we name our children we named them
[6:25] after something special that our God is
[6:28] to us and that
[6:30] is that he is a God full of grace full
[6:33] of mercy full of love and he he holds
[6:37] out pardon and forgiveness His grace is
[6:41] way bigger than what we could ever
[6:43] imagine
[6:43] amen his mercy endures to every
[6:47] generation and is new every morning so

[41:47] scripture together this morning before

[41:52] to the word Isaiah 35 we'll read from
[41:56] the first verse down through about oh
[42:01] we're gonna go down to about the 10th
[42:04] verse so let's read this together the
[42:07] wilderness and the solitary place shall
[42:10] be glad for them the desert shall
[42:14] rejoice and blossom as the rose is a
[42:18] blossom abundantly and rejoice even with
[42:22] joy and singing the glory of Lebanon
[42:26] shall be given unto it the excellency of
[42:29] Carmel and Sharon they shall see the
[42:32] glory of the Lord in the Exynos
[42:35] excellency of our God strengthen ye the
[42:39] weak hands and and confirmed the feeble
[42:42] knees say to them that our of a fearful
[42:46] heart be strong fear not behold your God
[42:50] will come with vengeance even God with a
[42:53] recompense he will come and save you and
[42:58] then in the eyes of the blind shall be
[43:00] opened the ears of the Dead Deaf shall
[43:02] be unstopped
[43:04] and then shall the lame man leap as in
[43:07] heart and the tongue of the dumb sing
[43:10] for in the wilderness shall waters break
[43:13] out and streams in the desert and the
[43:16] parched ground shall become a pool and
[43:18] the thirsty land Springs of water in the
[43:22] habitations of dragons weary sleigh
[43:24] shall be grass with weeds and rushes and
[43:27] a highway shall be there and a way and
[43:31] it shall be called the way of holiness
[43:35] the unclean shall not pass over it but
[43:39] it shall be for those the wayfaring man
[43:41] though foes shall not air therein no
[43:46] Lions shall be there near nor any
[43:48] ravenous beasts shall go up there on it
[43:51] shall not be found there
[43:53] but the redeemed shall walk there and
[43:57] the ransom of the Lord shall return and
[43:59] come to Zion with songs and everlasting
[44:03] joy upon their heads they shall obtain
[44:06] joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing
[44:10] shall flee away what a promise what a
[44:15] word of consolation this morning god
[44:17] bless you you can be seated I'm going to
[44:22] be speaking today on the highway and the
[44:26] way and as we go along this will I'm
[44:30] sure become more clear to you what we
[44:33] mean by the highway and the way brother
[44:37] Branham would tell a story in the
[44:39] message it is the rising of the Sun he
[44:42] would tell of an experience by the way
[44:45] of a dream that his mother had and she
[44:49] dreamed that brother Branham was
[44:50] standing by the side of three steps and
[44:55] he was preaching to everyone that they
[44:58] must walk up these three steps before
[45:01] they hit the highway and on the highway
[45:04] is a little pearly white line that runs
[45:07] straight to the doors of heaven to the
[45:10] pearly gate and that pearl had been
[45:13] stretched out to the top of these steps
[45:15] and he said if that's not my message of
[45:18] exactly today of the justification and
[45:21] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[45:23] Ghost and I was saying that a person has
[45:26] to come by these three steps to be able
[45:29] to walk that highway now there was a
[45:32] lady come by you know what kind of shoes
[45:34] people had on 35 years ago and of course
[45:37] now this was 65 1965 when he says that
[45:41] so 35 years before this and there was a
[45:45] lady came by with had a great big pair
[45:48] like to wear today of spiked heels shoes
[45:51] and she came by and said I said wait a
[45:54] minute
[45:55] you can't walk that highway with that
[46:00] said you can't do that and she turned
[46:02] her she turned and said I looked around
[46:05] to wrestle women and said don't believe
[46:07] him he's a madman
[46:08] don't believe him I'll show you I can be
[46:11] justified sanctified and filled with the
[46:13] Holy Ghost
[46:13] and still walk that and he said I just
[46:16] let her go I couldn't do no more about
[46:19] it couldn't stop her and she jumped up
[46:21] on the highway and then she looked back
[46:23] at the sisters and said I see I told you
[46:26] so and she started to run and he said
[46:30] that she ran like described in Isaiah
[46:32] the 5th chapter you know like the wood
[46:35] without stretch next you know because
[46:37] they have to because it pitched over in
[46:39] those spike heeled shoes and they'd have
[46:42] to twist Minson as they go and making a
[46:45] tinkling with their heels the daughters
[46:47] of Zion in the last day in she started
[46:50] up that highway just as hard as she
[46:53] could run and and after a while the road
[46:55] got narrower and narrower and she
[46:58] started reeling mincing like that and
[47:00] off she went and and in the dream his
[47:05] mother said I heard that the harmless
[47:07] screams I ever heard in my life was that
[47:10] woman falling into those flames and
[47:13] smoke going down like that and I turned
[47:16] around and said see she just obeyed
[47:18] every word but everything but one word
[47:20] everything but one word and then he goes
[47:23] on to remark Pentecostal women can be
[47:26] saved sanctified filled with the Holy
[47:28] Ghost and then failed absolutely men
[47:32] shall not live by bread alone but by
[47:34] every word that proceeds and she failed
[47:37] it and as I said she would have went
[47:39] when I went on all right but she failed
[47:41] to listen telling her what was ahead and
[47:45] he wrote the gospel by the disciples
[47:46] apostles of doctrine of the apostles and
[47:49] prophets and so forth and they won't
[47:51] listen so you know this shows you that
[47:55] you can jump on this highway and if
[47:59] there's no true anchor within the soul
[48:02] that causes you to want to keep the Word
[48:06] of God and keep the way of holiness
[48:09] that you're gonna wreck up somewhere
[48:11] because if you look on this highway
[48:14] right here it's it's over here on the
[48:17] edges on either side whether you can
[48:20] fall away god-made away but it is on the
[48:24] side of the road only on that getting to
[48:28] the extreme one way or the other losing
[48:31] your balance that will cause you to fall
[48:35] off and and lose the the victory that
[48:40] you started out with you see you're
[48:42] going to wreck up somewhere because
[48:43] there's nothing in the control tower of
[48:46] the soul that keeps you from going to
[48:49] the extreme to the right or to the left
[48:51] it's got to be a balanced walk and so
[48:55] don't try to walk this highway without
[49:00] the seal of God now this is very
[49:02] important for you to understand you know
[49:05] you're in order to walk this highway
[49:07] you've got to have the seal of God you
[49:10] can have experiences of justification
[49:13] sanctification and even baptisms of the
[49:16] Spirit but if you don't have something
[49:18] that will cause you to keep the Word of
[49:21] God and live true to the word you're
[49:23] gonna fall off somewhere when the road
[49:26] gets narrow Amen now again if you if
[49:30] you're truly filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:32] and sealed to the day of redemption
[49:34] you're never gonna fall off this highway
[49:36] so let's get that straight as we go
[49:39] because you know it's not uh it's not
[49:42] that our salvation is not secure our
[49:44] salvation is secure and then we're
[49:47] sealed to the day of redemption but if
[49:49] you don't go into it right and get on
[49:52] this highway and go to runnin you're
[49:54] gonna go to the extreme one way or the
[49:56] other now this is what we're gonna be
[49:58] talking about today now I'm brother
[50:00] Brandon would talk about his own
[50:02] ministry and he says about his own
[50:04] selfie said I'm not a legalistic neither
[50:07] am i and Armenian are a Calvinist and
[50:10] and he said I believe that each one had
[50:13] a doctrine in one of them was was was
[50:15] legalism and the other was extreme grace
[50:18] but he said that run off on the deep
[50:21] side of it they they just stayed with
[50:23] that and didn't balance the thing up
[50:25] there's a highway and a way and the way
[50:29] is the road a highway has a post way
[50:34] over here in a post way over there but
[50:36] in the middle of this highway comes the
[50:38] road and you can be and you can be in a
[50:42] highway and being a gun now you just
[50:45] envision our highways today and and you
[50:48] know they're the highway has a gutter on
[50:51] this side and a gutter on that side all
[50:54] of this is in the right-of-way of the
[50:56] highway and here is where you see the
[50:59] wrecks along the side the road
[51:02] how many crosses do you see and
[51:05] memorials with people's names on it that
[51:08] are on the side of the road where people
[51:10] left the road a man then left the road
[51:14] and they wrecked up somewhere because
[51:16] they went on this side or that side they
[51:20] didn't stay in the road now remember in
[51:23] this road there's no way you can wreck
[51:25] if you stay in the middle of the road
[51:28] because it's a one-way street hey man
[51:31] now so it's a it's a highway and away
[51:36] and there's a conjunction which brings
[51:39] the highway down to a way and then and
[51:42] here's where your travel is in the way
[51:44] that's where the smooth running is you
[51:46] remember they call it the way in the
[51:48] Bible all that was found in this way is
[51:51] called away now brother Branham would
[51:55] also speak of this in the Hebrew book
[51:57] and and he would share about the
[52:00] Nazarene people and the Nazarenes
[52:02] predated the Pentecost to move and they
[52:05] were holiness people and he said the
[52:08] Lord blessed those dear people old
[52:10] fashioned sanctified Methodists is what
[52:12] they were and the Church of God and
[52:15] Nazarene and pilgrim holiness and many
[52:18] of the good old holiness churches and
[52:20] they used to sing a song on I'm walking
[52:23] in the grand old highway telling them
[52:24] where that I go I'd rather be an
[52:26] old-time Christian Lord than anything
[52:28] that I know and so he says I'm they talk
[52:32] about the highway of holiness
[52:34] but he says there's a highway and the
[52:37] way it's not just good enough to get on
[52:40] the highway you must stay in the way or
[52:43] in the middle of the road this is called
[52:47] the way of holiness and the answer it's
[52:51] it's the road is he said the way of the
[52:54] road is in the middle of the road is
[52:56] built like this so the waters will wash
[52:58] off the trash to both sides keeping the
[53:01] road clean you don't have puddles
[53:03] standing in your road all the time or
[53:05] you will have if it isn't built right
[53:07] the way is the middle of the road on
[53:10] this side when people get converted now
[53:13] listen closely their minds are set right
[53:16] on Christ so now you're aiming right
[53:18] straight toward Christ
[53:20] and and if they're just a little
[53:22] scholarly and they don't keep under
[53:24] prayer they'll get real cold and starch
[53:28] and stiff and starchy and then different
[53:31] so here we got one extreme over here on
[53:34] this side and this causes some direct
[53:37] amen because they get this you know get
[53:41] they get educated in the message they
[53:43] become scholarly and stiff and cold and
[53:48] starchy and indifferent
[53:50] now this is real important you
[53:53] understand they get indifferent because
[53:55] there's no burden for the lost soul hey
[53:58] man it just becomes about us for and no
[54:01] more
[54:01] it just becomes a you know a very
[54:04] narrow-minded me and us and that's all
[54:08] that's gonna make it and so there's no
[54:10] there's no concern for anybody else
[54:14] remember there there is no fellowship
[54:17] with anybody else it's just us you know
[54:19] we're we're we're on this Highway and
[54:21] they and they get cold still start
[54:24] seeing a difference and then if they're
[54:27] just a little nervous he says if you
[54:29] don't watch they go to the other side
[54:33] which he calls the radical and wild on
[54:36] this side and they're going to
[54:37] sensations and everything else when the
[54:41] end so he says is so here again we have
[54:44] another side
[54:45] the road and the other side of the road
[54:47] is is radical and men and wild nervous
[54:52] you know again sensations little
[54:57] feelings becoming real spiritual where
[55:00] that nothing nobody can tell you
[55:02] anything you don't have to go to church
[55:04] you don't you don't have to be subject
[55:06] to anything because you're so spiritual
[55:09] you're so radical you're having your own
[55:11] little visions and dreams and God's
[55:13] talking to you you know as if you're the
[55:15] only one in the world and and so you
[55:18] know and whatever you get becomes the
[55:21] absolute instead of the Word of God and
[55:23] so you have this radical side on the
[55:26] other side and we both so we've seen
[55:28] them all and then we've seen them where
[55:30] they're radical and we've seen them
[55:32] where that they are scholarly and then
[55:35] different and cold and man there's two
[55:38] sides of it but the real church I mean
[55:41] wants to be a real church the real
[55:43] church is a real sane gospel right down
[55:46] the middle of the road it's not cold and
[55:50] starchy neither is it fanaticism it's a
[55:53] real good old warm gospel heartfelt love
[55:57] of God going right down the middle of
[55:59] the road calling from both sides
[56:01] in other words calling those their
[56:03] fanatical you don't come on come on in
[56:06] and get here in the center calling those
[56:09] that are scholarly and and cold and
[56:11] indifferent and and lukewarm get over
[56:14] here get in the center you walk in the
[56:17] edge over there you're going to wreck so
[56:22] well I've been justified and sanctified
[56:24] and filled with the Holy Ghost yet but
[56:26] if it doesn't cause you to go go
[56:28] according to the word you know you might
[56:31] be on the highway but you're not gonna
[56:33] last long now so again it's calling them
[56:39] right back to the word notice verse
[56:42] eight again and a highway shall be there
[56:44] and a way and it shall be called the way
[56:49] or the road of holiness the unclean
[56:54] shall not pass over it but it shall be
[56:57] for those
[56:58] wayfaring man the one who's the travelin
[57:02] man the man who's making progression
[57:04] this road is not to sit still on a man
[57:09] to stay where you have been for the last
[57:11] 20 years and you know sometimes even
[57:14] hear preachers while I preach the same
[57:16] thing I'll have for 40 years and I say
[57:18] well shame on ya and then you oughta
[57:21] progress somewhere
[57:22] you ought to want a little deeper in
[57:24] Christ you the order
[57:26] you oughta advance somewhere man and
[57:30] again you said well I'm exactly where I
[57:32] was 20 years ago what shame on you the
[57:35] menu you need to be you need to be
[57:38] traveling down this road it's for the
[57:40] travelin man a man and me and the fools
[57:44] or even though there is simple in other
[57:47] words they will not air therein it's
[57:50] well marked a man is it's it's well
[57:56] marked out for you straight as a gate
[57:59] narrows away and we don't you to be that
[58:01] find it but it's well marked for the
[58:04] believer all the way a man so now you
[58:08] know the in the endless and then dealing
[58:11] with this we we're living in a time
[58:13] where you know there there's been these
[58:16] two extremes we have we have the
[58:19] denominational world that on some of
[58:22] them were on one side of the cold
[58:25] starchy formalism of just accept Jesus
[58:29] as your Savior and you're safe so you
[58:31] got that one side then you got the other
[58:33] side that went into fanaticism
[58:35] with sensations all the way to the
[58:38] extremes of not just tongues or speaking
[58:40] in tongues but blood in the hands and
[58:43] all in the forehead even things in other
[58:45] words it wasn't scriptural and dependent
[58:47] on seals and certain feelings or tongues
[58:50] is an evidence instead of a change life
[58:55] what you're one to see is a change life
[58:59] I don't really care you know how it
[59:02] comes to you as long as your life gets
[59:05] changed
[59:06] and then something summer real summer
[59:09] real vocal and and they stream out in
[59:12] the shower and they um you know just a
[59:17] real real vocal others are really quiet
[59:20] and and their stream runs deep and you
[59:23] don't you don't hear a lot of noise but
[59:26] you see a life and that's what we want
[59:30] to see is we want to see a Christian
[59:31] life a man we want to see that instead
[59:35] of but instead of keeping the balance
[59:37] man many as went to the other ditch of
[59:41] and even in the message you can see it
[59:44] happen that they go into the ditch of no
[59:47] emotion or no feeling hardly a name and
[59:51] and turn the message into cold creams
[59:55] now like I said the reason why that most
[59:59] of the message people are in that ditch
[1:00:01] is because brother branham made a
[1:00:03] correction and man he made a correction
[1:00:06] because of the extreme fanaticism of the
[1:00:09] Pentecostal groups that he was working
[1:00:11] with he really hammered against the
[1:00:14] extreme fanaticism and that in some
[1:00:17] jerks so hard made the corrections so
[1:00:20] hard until you can hardly get an amen in
[1:00:23] the church you can ever can hardly have
[1:00:26] any worship in the church
[1:00:28] there's no healings there's no miracles
[1:00:30] there's no prayer lines there's no altar
[1:00:33] calls and then there there's no
[1:00:36] experience with God it has just been
[1:00:39] replaced work for another called a
[1:00:42] confession of faith now again I want I'm
[1:00:49] gonna share some things about it because
[1:00:52] here's what he was dealing with many of
[1:00:54] those people join those big classical
[1:00:56] things just to be popular they shouldn't
[1:00:59] it ain't no different there the spirit
[1:01:01] of life that works in the world would
[1:01:03] tell them that that's different if they
[1:01:05] got any spark about him and then he
[1:01:08] talks about they go after these
[1:01:11] fantastics
[1:01:12] of frogs jumping bugs are flying shake
[1:01:16] him jumping running everything else
[1:01:19] where
[1:01:20] they know that's contrary but they go
[1:01:22] with it because it's a sensation now
[1:01:26] during this era of time brother Branham
[1:01:28] was dealing with Pentecostal
[1:01:30] contemporary ministers who were who were
[1:01:34] testifying of heaven Budd in their hands
[1:01:37] and all in their foreheads and they were
[1:01:40] claiming that this blood that was coming
[1:01:43] out of even some of the women's hands
[1:01:46] were we're on Oh had redemptive
[1:01:49] qualities and he says this is true it
[1:01:52] takes away from the power of the blood
[1:01:54] of Jesus Christ and makes it unnecessary
[1:01:57] so you know brother Branham was coming
[1:01:59] out very hard against the sensationalism
[1:02:03] that was going on he said I don't care
[1:02:05] about sensations I want thus saith the
[1:02:09] Lord
[1:02:10] that's right what the word says and I
[1:02:12] believe and I believe in a heartfelt
[1:02:15] religion now don't get it wrong just
[1:02:18] because we're coming out against
[1:02:20] sensations don't mean that we don't
[1:02:22] believe in a heartfelt religion now I
[1:02:25] believe I am the joy that I can know the
[1:02:30] joy I can know if I can get to it this
[1:02:32] morning I want to speak about that from
[1:02:35] the scripture you know the joy that I
[1:02:37] can know I believe in the power of the
[1:02:40] Holy Spirit I believe in divine healing
[1:02:44] I believe in all the manifestations of
[1:02:47] the gifts but they must be reverently
[1:02:50] placed in the Bible body working exactly
[1:02:53] in harmony with the word so you know
[1:02:57] when brother Branham was recounting some
[1:03:00] of the things that had been restored
[1:03:02] before the open and other seals one of
[1:03:06] them was something that he as he would
[1:03:09] he gave a whole list someone that he got
[1:03:12] from Schofield and and from his notes
[1:03:15] and some that he added like the truth of
[1:03:17] serpent seed and and then this is
[1:03:19] another one I want to bring it to you in
[1:03:21] the services is this a time he said the
[1:03:24] mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:27] without sensation but the personal
[1:03:31] Christ performing
[1:03:32] you that works that he did so he talked
[1:03:36] about the mystery of the baptism of the
[1:03:39] Holy Ghost without sensation now you
[1:03:44] know once again as I as I've cautioned
[1:03:47] you you can't build a doctrine on one
[1:03:51] quote nor can you build it on 1/2 a
[1:03:54] quote just like you can't build a
[1:03:58] doctrine on just one scripture for
[1:04:00] example what if you take Matthew 28:19
[1:04:02] and refuse to look at acts 2:38 that
[1:04:07] brings you the understanding and
[1:04:10] enlightenment of what Jesus said to when
[1:04:12] he said to be baptized in his name what
[1:04:15] if you only take that one scripture you
[1:04:18] see then then you're baptized and
[1:04:20] entitle and not a name right so again
[1:04:24] you can't use one scripture it must be
[1:04:27] something from Genesis to Revelation it
[1:04:31] cannot be just one scripture and then in
[1:04:34] the case also you're gonna have to when
[1:04:38] you when you hear something said don't
[1:04:40] isolate one little statement and then
[1:04:43] build a doctor knowing it amen look and
[1:04:47] see it all the way through the Bible all
[1:04:50] the way through the message are you with
[1:04:52] me now in this case a doctrine has been
[1:04:55] built on half of the quote and that is
[1:05:00] again stressing the mystery of the
[1:05:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:05:05] sensation now sensation means without
[1:05:08] feeling or without knowing it without
[1:05:13] any eye without any intelligence that
[1:05:17] anything happened and so this becomes
[1:05:20] that idea that we can get the Holy Ghost
[1:05:23] today and not even know it
[1:05:25] and that we can have the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:29] has no feelings with it we see you can't
[1:05:32] run that from Genesis to Revelation you
[1:05:36] can't run that even through the message
[1:05:39] hey man but because here's the other
[1:05:42] half of the quote here
[1:05:44] i'ma bring it to you but the person of
[1:05:47] Christ see not a sensation not just a
[1:05:51] feeling but the person of Christ because
[1:05:54] he you can have you can have a feeling
[1:05:57] and not receive the person of Christ you
[1:06:00] can have a sensation or given vision I
[1:06:03] have a dream and they need me
[1:06:05] spiritually even come to pass he didn't
[1:06:06] speak and real genuine Holy Ghost
[1:06:09] tongues and still remain unchanged
[1:06:11] within the soul having not received the
[1:06:14] person of Christ so he said but the
[1:06:16] person of Christ performing and you the
[1:06:20] same works that she did the same works
[1:06:25] that he did now here's the other half of
[1:06:28] the quote you see and here are some of
[1:06:31] the works that he did a man what some of
[1:06:35] the works that he did was holiness a
[1:06:39] holy life obedience to the world a man
[1:06:44] faith a belief in the word healings
[1:06:48] miracles tous gifts of the Spirit you
[1:06:52] know because you know again we have to
[1:06:55] match this with the rest of Scripture in
[1:06:57] my name he said these signs shall follow
[1:07:00] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:07:03] cast out devils they will speak with new
[1:07:05] tongues a man they shall lay hands on
[1:07:10] the sick and they shall recover all of
[1:07:13] these are the works of Christ so when we
[1:07:17] have the person in you he will perform
[1:07:20] the works of Christ not just one work of
[1:07:23] a healing or miracle or sign or a wonder
[1:07:26] or a tongue or a job or dance but but
[1:07:29] all his works aim of all his works so
[1:07:36] you see again these are these are the
[1:07:40] things that follow a believers if you
[1:07:43] really believe these follow now brother
[1:07:47] Branham would talk about this and God
[1:07:49] hiding himself in simplicity as he
[1:07:51] approaches the seven seals and he said
[1:07:54] we find out that people get so smart in
[1:07:57] educated now I want to show you another
[1:07:59] then so he takes this one side smart and
[1:08:03] educated and he said and the other goes
[1:08:06] to the far to the other side they become
[1:08:09] fanatics trying to be religious now we
[1:08:13] have that group they go to the other
[1:08:15] side now you said that's where I differ
[1:08:17] with the group of brethren and he's
[1:08:19] talking about a group of people up in
[1:08:23] Canada that that they they just couldn't
[1:08:27] see the phenomenon of it being done
[1:08:29] unless they made themselves a group and
[1:08:32] what they did is they even just took
[1:08:34] some words and brother branham and Ansem
[1:08:37] lee even teaches and he did and ran with
[1:08:39] with a thought Oh manifested sons and
[1:08:42] they then then they were the manifested
[1:08:45] son speak in the word and now they're
[1:08:47] going to lay hands on different ones and
[1:08:49] and give them a ministry you know and
[1:08:52] and so they they were prophesying and
[1:08:55] given ministry they called ourselves a
[1:08:58] latter rain and it started out with a
[1:09:01] with a genuine move of God with an
[1:09:05] outpouring of divine love and the world
[1:09:09] the the spirit just fell but in stay
[1:09:13] instead of staying humble with it they
[1:09:15] took it over into fanaticism and he said
[1:09:19] then they condemn their other thing and
[1:09:21] that they and and the taste and the
[1:09:24] things till they come from on to the
[1:09:26] other side so they they condemned so
[1:09:29] much the the word and knowing the word
[1:09:34] until they go to the fanatical on the
[1:09:36] other side now he said so there's one
[1:09:39] side that is highly intellectual cold
[1:09:43] and and different and they deny
[1:09:44] everything there and then the other only
[1:09:48] gets on the other side and it's a
[1:09:50] radical bunch of emotion and deny the
[1:09:52] word but the real true church again who
[1:09:56] wants to be a real true church stays
[1:09:59] right in the middle of the road now so
[1:10:03] like we said look on the side of the
[1:10:05] road even look at this example where do
[1:10:08] you go I mean if you follow
[1:10:10] this highway where are you gonna go
[1:10:12] you're just falling out it and the
[1:10:15] tumbling over into into eternity
[1:10:17] somewhere off of the highway it's never
[1:10:20] going to take you anywhere radicalism
[1:10:23] will not do it neither will formalism
[1:10:26] you've got to stay in the middle of the
[1:10:30] road you can't be over here in emotion
[1:10:32] and deny the word but you can't get on
[1:10:35] the other side in its word word word
[1:10:36] word and there's no life no emotion no
[1:10:39] power no no spirit or nothing else it's
[1:10:42] got to stay right in the middle of the
[1:10:45] road there's a highway and the way it
[1:10:48] isn't good enough to be on the edge
[1:10:51] you're gonna fall off you've got to come
[1:10:55] into balance and every Christian all
[1:10:58] this tried to cover the balance in their
[1:11:02] walk with God and like I said look on
[1:11:06] the side of the road how many memorials
[1:11:07] are there with names and flowers because
[1:11:10] people left the road for a ditch
[1:11:13] something knocked a moth throat again in
[1:11:16] the garden simplicity's said if you
[1:11:18] notice it's got the Bible knowledge of
[1:11:21] what God said and his spiritual enough
[1:11:23] to be warm in his heart it's just a road
[1:11:26] I say you said it would be that way
[1:11:28] there's a highway and the blessing of
[1:11:30] precious Friends of Nazarene Church
[1:11:33] Almighty little move of God started up
[1:11:35] but what they do when God began to speak
[1:11:38] in tongues in the church they were so
[1:11:40] religiously and so self starts till they
[1:11:43] called it the devil and you see what
[1:11:45] happened to them
[1:11:46] so here again they're they're on this
[1:11:49] road and they're they get on the road
[1:11:51] and they get over here too far to to the
[1:11:55] left that get over here in Orem sup
[1:11:58] works you know of well you can't wear
[1:12:01] this and you you can't do this and they
[1:12:03] get really ordering extreme of
[1:12:05] fanaticism and make their religion about
[1:12:09] what kind of clothes they wear and what
[1:12:12] kind of things they don't do and when
[1:12:15] when the Holy Spirit began to speak in
[1:12:17] tongues they went so far they just shut
[1:12:21] the wheel so far away from that
[1:12:23] until the the Nazarene Church went into
[1:12:26] backslidden condition to worry even they
[1:12:29] even lost the holiness that there once
[1:12:32] had because they wouldn't even go on
[1:12:34] with God now so he said again when we'd
[1:12:39] got begin to speak in tongues in the
[1:12:41] church they were so religiously and so
[1:12:43] self starts that they called it the
[1:12:46] devil and see what happened to them then
[1:12:50] holier-than-thou and and so we find he
[1:12:52] stays that goes to seed and dives right
[1:12:55] out notice that go to seed on there
[1:12:58] rather than staying humble walking with
[1:13:02] God that go into fanaticism our
[1:13:04] formalism now he said the other side
[1:13:07] becomes a fanatic and the other side
[1:13:10] becomes cold and starchy now I say it
[1:13:13] said it would be a highway and denies
[1:13:15] rains many of the holiness people that
[1:13:17] bless an old highway glory to God we
[1:13:19] walk in the highway but remember that
[1:13:21] wasn't exactly what he said
[1:13:22] there's a highway and and and as a
[1:13:25] conjecture conjunction and away and it's
[1:13:28] somebody called a highway of holiness
[1:13:30] and it shall not be called a highway of
[1:13:33] holiness but the way of holiness and he
[1:13:36] said people try to make themselves holy
[1:13:42] and when you do he says it is like I
[1:13:46] said before it's like a buzzard trying
[1:13:48] to put duck feathers in him and trying
[1:13:50] to make a dove out of it when his nature
[1:13:53] is still a buzzard and man see it would
[1:13:57] be like a crow trying to put pigeon
[1:13:59] feathers in or peacock say and see I'm a
[1:14:02] beautiful bird and it's something
[1:14:04] manufactured and this is what has
[1:14:07] happened to often is we are we've taken
[1:14:10] crows and buzzards people without a real
[1:14:13] change taught them how to dress right do
[1:14:17] right come to church even you know pay
[1:14:19] your tithes be a good person and yet
[1:14:22] unchanged on the inside and he said it's
[1:14:26] exactly like a crow or a buzzard trying
[1:14:29] to put in peacock feathers and say look
[1:14:31] I'm a peacock you see doing that
[1:14:35] and change you but if you are changed
[1:14:38] it's going to grow from the inside out
[1:14:40] it's not that you won't have the right
[1:14:43] kind of feathers you need that you won't
[1:14:46] have dug feathers or in the case of
[1:14:48] peacock peacock feathers but if it's
[1:14:50] peacock is gonna be a peacock from the
[1:14:52] inside it's going to be a dove from the
[1:14:55] inside and that's the whole idea is not
[1:14:58] change our outside but change our inside
[1:15:02] word that things can grow from the
[1:15:06] inside out that's a mistake we even make
[1:15:10] a lot of times with new Christians you
[1:15:12] know it's kind of like kitchen fish you
[1:15:14] can't clean them till you catch them
[1:15:17] catch them first
[1:15:19] a man catch them with the gospel bring a
[1:15:22] beer
[1:15:23] get him down to an experience with
[1:15:25] Christ and then God will clean them up
[1:15:27] then they'll be humble to the Word of
[1:15:30] God a man now but he said a peacock
[1:15:33] don't have to worry about whether he's
[1:15:36] going to have peacock feathers I'm not
[1:15:38] Doug doesn't have to worry what he's
[1:15:39] gonna have dove feathers or not as long
[1:15:42] as his nature is a dove he will have
[1:15:45] dove feathers and the holiness people
[1:15:49] begin to say the women must wear long
[1:15:51] hair and long sleeves and these things
[1:15:53] long skirts and not wear wedding rings
[1:15:55] and jewelry of any type and he said it
[1:15:58] became a self-righteous holiness see
[1:16:02] that's a matter of fact your holiness
[1:16:05] now listen you can you can quit cutting
[1:16:09] your hair and any even brother metals
[1:16:12] that don't do we're talking about the
[1:16:13] women now you quit cutting your hair and
[1:16:15] he said don't do it because the Bible
[1:16:18] said not to do it or even I said not to
[1:16:21] do it but do it because there's a change
[1:16:23] on the inside of you you see and that's
[1:16:27] the mistake people make they are trying
[1:16:30] to live the word without a nature change
[1:16:34] and it becomes a self-made
[1:16:37] self-righteous holiness and down the
[1:16:41] road they get off they get into
[1:16:43] radicalism in and are somewhere
[1:16:46] there's a formalism one of the other and
[1:16:48] offs they go in the fall away they new
[1:16:51] you see converts are not one to
[1:16:55] Christianity by its governments by its
[1:16:58] rules and regulations and that we when
[1:17:02] converts by an experience with Christ
[1:17:06] getting them to know Jesus and then
[1:17:09] letting Jesus become the Lord of their
[1:17:12] life and when he's Lord and ruler he'll
[1:17:15] bring everything subject to the word hey
[1:17:20] man but a lot of times we're going to
[1:17:22] this backwards
[1:17:22] he said looks what's happened to the
[1:17:25] denomination now no I know I know I know
[1:17:27] you say well now wait a minute brother
[1:17:28] Tim well then we sit and we sit like our
[1:17:31] young people we shouldn't you know
[1:17:33] they're not converted so just let them
[1:17:35] just let no you can't do that you have
[1:17:38] to tell them what the Word of God said
[1:17:40] they know better you can show them in
[1:17:42] the Bible but the law just and you're
[1:17:45] striving against so all just means you
[1:17:48] need Jesus God took the whole law thou
[1:17:53] shalt thou shalt not to prove that no
[1:17:56] man could live right that is and the law
[1:18:01] was given that it might bring them to
[1:18:03] Christ and make them realize I need a
[1:18:04] Savior
[1:18:05] I don't need a law I need a Savior I
[1:18:08] can't keep this word I can't do
[1:18:12] everything right it's impossible for me
[1:18:15] to live right and so the law the law
[1:18:19] reveals to you I need Jesus so when we
[1:18:22] preach about holiness and things like
[1:18:25] that what we're really trying to tell
[1:18:26] you is you need Jesus and if you get
[1:18:31] Jesus on the inside you'll never need
[1:18:33] another sermon about holiness because I
[1:18:36] holiness will come naturally from the
[1:18:38] inside and going outside amen so it's
[1:18:45] automatically lived so again again you
[1:18:49] see today there's a lot of manufactured
[1:18:53] holiness and and and and it is Pharisee
[1:18:58] ISM thank you brother Aaron
[1:18:59] it is just pharisee ism and they could
[1:19:02] do that so well but Jesus called them
[1:19:05] hypocrites you know I you know what
[1:19:08] hypocrite men actor that's what they
[1:19:10] called the stage the guy the guys
[1:19:13] playing that on the stage you know they
[1:19:15] call him hypocrites or actors they were
[1:19:19] pretending to be something they were not
[1:19:21] in reality a man and that's what a
[1:19:24] hypocrite is he's pretending to be
[1:19:26] something but he's really not that and
[1:19:31] the gospel makes you something real and
[1:19:35] the world is not looking for an actor
[1:19:38] the world is looking for something that
[1:19:41] is real something that lil something
[1:19:44] that works something that change life
[1:19:47] better change your nature and make you a
[1:19:49] son or daughter of God amen now again
[1:19:55] you know the mentality of the of the
[1:19:57] church world today is you just gotta say
[1:20:00] never everyday but you see you don't
[1:20:02] have to you do it because you willfully
[1:20:06] want to
[1:20:07] and the reason you willfully want to
[1:20:09] because you never died to yourself when
[1:20:12] you know when when you die to yourself
[1:20:14] you become a new creature and but when
[1:20:18] you see these other things like the
[1:20:19] world and cutting hair and paint even to
[1:20:22] come out against the Word of God what
[1:20:24] does it show shows the Holy Ghost isn't
[1:20:26] there that's what it reveals shows that
[1:20:30] person needs Jesus that's not a bad
[1:20:33] thing that's a good thing
[1:20:36] hey man let's just let's just make it
[1:20:38] straight we need Jesus
[1:20:40] and that's a good thing to need it is a
[1:20:43] good thing to find out that you need him
[1:20:45] before the rapture because here you wait
[1:20:49] down the rapture day and find out you
[1:20:50] don't have the token the ticket to go
[1:20:52] you're left behind now but God wants his
[1:20:59] church to and wants to bring his church
[1:21:03] to maturity so that they can walk this
[1:21:07] road
[1:21:08] down the middle of the road call him
[1:21:12] from both sides now again he would he
[1:21:18] would brother branham would tell us and
[1:21:20] what was a Holy Ghost given far he said
[1:21:22] what is the Holy Ghost
[1:21:24] it's got Enya what's it for to continue
[1:21:28] his work among his people to bring his
[1:21:31] church together to bring a church to a
[1:21:33] place in this day beyond Lutheran and
[1:21:36] Methodist and Pentecostal into a place
[1:21:39] to adoption it and rapture Grace and
[1:21:43] when that one this part of the church
[1:21:45] when the spirit moves in this church
[1:21:48] here it'll just raise and it'll bring
[1:21:50] forth all the redeemed that's been
[1:21:52] touched by that spirit and those losers
[1:21:55] who stood there with all the light they
[1:21:57] had and justification and those
[1:21:59] Methodists that fell on the floor and
[1:22:01] throwed water in their face from the
[1:22:03] spirit striking them through
[1:22:04] sanctification those Pentecostals that
[1:22:06] walked up and down the streets and they
[1:22:08] call them tongues demons and jabbers and
[1:22:10] goofs language and all of that they'll
[1:22:12] stand in the righteousness in the sight
[1:22:15] of God is that day just as certain as
[1:22:17] the Bible stands here if you believe me
[1:22:19] to be a servant you call me as prophet I
[1:22:22] don't call myself that but listen I'm
[1:22:23] telling you in the name of the Lord
[1:22:25] those entering Christ
[1:22:27] will God bring with him as his coming
[1:22:29] and his resurrection and those only
[1:22:32] those that are in Christ so there's got
[1:22:34] a cup of church to majority there's got
[1:22:38] to be a people with balance right here
[1:22:42] at this end time that walks in balance
[1:22:46] that are not on the extreme one way or
[1:22:48] the other are you with me and that's
[1:22:51] what God is loading to adopt is a people
[1:22:55] a church that he can cause to raise
[1:22:57] higher and end them raising higher they
[1:23:01] bring as their brethren I tell you it's
[1:23:05] about time that comes a call out of this
[1:23:08] bride that says to the people before us
[1:23:11] raise up
[1:23:13] a man and they raise up and they say
[1:23:15] that their brother raised up over the to
[1:23:19] verse seven ages they all rise
[1:23:21] we are in resurrection tower and there
[1:23:26] must be a mature Church a man who are
[1:23:31] who is an adopted people who are people
[1:23:33] who knows a god of people who does
[1:23:36] exploits are you with me now now this is
[1:23:41] very important when God proves remember
[1:23:45] on the individual with God proves and
[1:23:49] God loves when a man proves and God
[1:23:53] loves him he takes him out some word
[1:23:54] himself following the Roman custom of
[1:23:58] adoption there in the front of angels he
[1:24:01] does something for him he lifts him
[1:24:03] there in the presence of God this is
[1:24:06] what the message is to do for you is to
[1:24:07] lift you up and around higher I meant
[1:24:12] it's to advance you on this highway I
[1:24:16] managed to bring you in the glory it's
[1:24:21] not to leave you here at ground level
[1:24:23] it's to bring you at the glory and
[1:24:25] matter where the people reaches there
[1:24:28] they're gonna be calling their brother
[1:24:31] there's going to be a resurrection are
[1:24:34] you with me Church he lifts him he lifts
[1:24:38] him up there in the presence of God and
[1:24:40] gives him and feels him and sets him out
[1:24:43] that's the age we are living in I want
[1:24:47] to get it to you that's the age we're
[1:24:49] living we're living it more than a dip
[1:24:52] of the spirit or measure of Christ or a
[1:24:55] measure of the word we're in the day and
[1:24:58] the hour where the fullness has come the
[1:25:01] fullness of the word with the fullness
[1:25:03] of the Spirit to bring a church to
[1:25:07] Maternity
[1:25:11] now again the same Holy Spirit II said
[1:25:15] that saved the Lutheran sanctified the
[1:25:18] Methodist baptize of Pentecostals is now
[1:25:21] setting in order
[1:25:23] coming of the Lord Jesus how many
[1:25:25] believes this and then when it'll be so
[1:25:28] powerful that body will come into this
[1:25:31] group of the church that and draw the
[1:25:33] rest of them from the grain there'll be
[1:25:35] a resurrection that's what the Holy
[1:25:38] Ghost is far that's why we have come
[1:25:41] back to this homeland back to the Holy
[1:25:44] Ghost is so that there can be a
[1:25:47] resurrection so there can be a meeting
[1:25:51] in the air so there can't be a rapture
[1:25:57] hi ma'am now the church should be a full
[1:26:03] age now it's preaching about this last
[1:26:07] Sunday and I hope you got it would but
[1:26:11] beautiful term I was using that word
[1:26:14] full term this is the church now we're
[1:26:19] coming down to this church not just this
[1:26:22] individual church but the bride
[1:26:24] worldwide it must be a fully now we're
[1:26:30] here I just want to say we are here
[1:26:32] already we have arrived to the place
[1:26:36] where that the Sousa Street people came
[1:26:40] 50 years ago we have now had our 50
[1:26:46] years hey man we have a it's it's
[1:26:51] jubilee time and brother madam said if
[1:26:55] that child was obedient then there was a
[1:26:57] certain day would it be come of age now
[1:27:00] the Pentecostal church ought to be of
[1:27:02] that age 40 years old or better or 50 so
[1:27:07] it should be of age so he talks about
[1:27:10] the Pentecostal church they should be of
[1:27:12] age they're about 40 or 50 years of age
[1:27:17] listen when I started out with the
[1:27:20] message 15 year old boy preacher man I
[1:27:23] thought this was it I thought you know
[1:27:26] the rapture should come any moment I had
[1:27:29] no idea that that just by receiving the
[1:27:33] message though that that wasn't good
[1:27:35] what God had in mind he wanted he wanted
[1:27:38] every name that was on the book and
[1:27:41] there was more than had to be manifested
[1:27:45] there was more that had to come and we
[1:27:50] are carried now where we're coming down
[1:27:52] we'd be another Jubilee
[1:27:54] we're here with comer our 50 years
[1:27:57] pastor open another seven silver that
[1:27:59] are 50 years past 1965 we're weird
[1:28:04] fillets and God is going to adopt a
[1:28:13] people he's gonna he's gonna take a
[1:28:18] people and grant that people know we're
[1:28:20] not talking about individuals though
[1:28:22] that's true with individuals but I'm
[1:28:24] talking about the church he's going to
[1:28:26] give them a new robe come on he's going
[1:28:30] to change them come on the redemption of
[1:28:32] our bodies is that right he's gonna give
[1:28:36] us new bodies he's gonna give us a new
[1:28:38] robe the drunk driving by your place
[1:28:42] watching you rake the leaves I see I see
[1:28:45] brother butts out there it is brother
[1:28:46] butts but it's his brother drawn but
[1:28:50] brother Lovett butts we put him away in
[1:28:53] the grave here's something some years
[1:28:55] ago you know and I see time ticking
[1:29:00] along we're moving down we're not you
[1:29:05] know we're not young we're not young
[1:29:07] kids anymore and I want to say about the
[1:29:09] church now and I'm not just even talking
[1:29:12] about this church but I'm talking about
[1:29:14] the bride worldwide she's not she's not
[1:29:17] just a young church no more she should
[1:29:22] be a mature church and so it should be
[1:29:28] of age now if you come to age and your
[1:29:33] behavior does not meet there the
[1:29:36] adoption requirements you don't get the
[1:29:38] robe you don't have be handed the keys
[1:29:42] and back to the matter agent goes to
[1:29:44] tribulation so either either we come to
[1:29:49] maturity or we don't come to maturity if
[1:29:51] we come we go on a rapture if we don't
[1:29:54] we go we go right right on into
[1:29:56] tribulation because we're to end I want
[1:30:00] to I want to just quote do another
[1:30:02] brother branham assay and here you him
[1:30:04] that child did not obey it was not about
[1:30:07] Father's business God would raise him up
[1:30:10] another son a man couldn't get loser to
[1:30:16] maturity couldn't get him to go on God
[1:30:18] raised up another son the Methodists he
[1:30:21] couldn't get them to go on God raised up
[1:30:23] Azusa Street another son
[1:30:27] he couldn't you know they was in too
[1:30:29] extreme they wouldn't keep a balance
[1:30:30] they wouldn't come into maturity and God
[1:30:32] raised up another but after this they
[1:30:36] ain't no more listen what he said he
[1:30:40] says that's what he's done through the
[1:30:42] ages raising a polluter raisin of a
[1:30:45] Methodist raising up a Nazarene
[1:30:47] raising up a pilgrim whole ants raising
[1:30:49] up of Pentecost he will keep on raising
[1:30:51] and raising and raising until he gets
[1:30:55] one but we're out of Aegeus we're out of
[1:31:03] messages we're out of angels I'm not
[1:31:06] talking about heavenly angels I'm
[1:31:08] talking about the seven angels we got
[1:31:10] the last message the last messenger darn
[1:31:14] no more to cover you with me he'll keep
[1:31:16] raising and raising and raising until he
[1:31:19] gets one I hope to least see that church
[1:31:23] I hope they'll live to see that church
[1:31:25] when she raises in the power and the
[1:31:28] beauty of the Resurrection with the
[1:31:29] powers of God working to her sons and
[1:31:32] wonders following the believers like it
[1:31:35] did in the New Testament God in his
[1:31:38] power and his might
[1:31:40] oh how wonderful now that's the kind of
[1:31:42] church rather random look for and that's
[1:31:45] the kind of church we must be and here
[1:31:48] we are at the end time and listen look
[1:31:52] the look where the world is
[1:31:54] the world is sitting right in Sodom
[1:31:58] condition with enough firepower with
[1:32:01] enough atomic energy with enough dynamic
[1:32:06] power is somebody with me now with
[1:32:09] enough nuclear wealth on the firepower
[1:32:12] to burn the whole world and fulfilled
[1:32:15] Malekith for that the earth shall burn
[1:32:18] is another layer there
[1:32:21] Israel is over in their homeland they
[1:32:24] are there
[1:32:24] I'd say bride where are we to be ma'am
[1:32:29] I'm speaking to this church but I'm also
[1:32:32] speaking to the world where are we to be
[1:32:34] what are the church to be not to be a
[1:32:38] church I mature Church but people who
[1:32:41] know their God of people who have eaten
[1:32:44] this book but people who are prophesied
[1:32:46] again of people who are going for than
[1:32:49] power of the Resurrection and can I just
[1:32:56] say it is happening
[1:32:59] it's happening we're just we have just
[1:33:02] seen the very edge of what God is
[1:33:05] beginning to do but I say oh god don't
[1:33:09] let some immaturity keep us out of it
[1:33:12] but let us be a mature Church an
[1:33:15] anointed Church and anointed people
[1:33:22] Russia says he has a mother of all bombs
[1:33:25] the rub nation North Korea has been
[1:33:28] working quietly and previously now
[1:33:30] threatens the world our mountain is
[1:33:33] coming
[1:33:35] hey man it's coming the few fires the
[1:33:40] little fires we see in California ain't
[1:33:42] nothing like what's going to strike the
[1:33:44] nation any mountain so it's in this hour
[1:33:49] and this time when that's their setting
[1:33:51] ready easels over there
[1:33:52] setting ready to receive this word mmm
[1:33:56] but now notice brother brendensen but
[1:33:58] now when we need it the Spirit of God
[1:34:01] raises a standard and what is he's
[1:34:04] poured in a spirit then those who are
[1:34:06] resting out yonder in the grave or under
[1:34:09] the altar as the scripture says crying
[1:34:11] how long Lord how long how much longer
[1:34:14] God is waiting on me and you
[1:34:19] the church is waiting on me and you
[1:34:23] adoption time when God can pour into us
[1:34:26] his fullness his power his resurrection
[1:34:29] that when the church in Christ becomes
[1:34:31] so close together till Christ becomes
[1:34:34] visible among us and raises our dead and
[1:34:37] we go in the rapture we should be no I
[1:34:43] know I'm bringing not just to the church
[1:34:46] here but to thee to the to the bride
[1:34:51] movement worldwide he said why would you
[1:34:55] concern yourself outside of your own
[1:34:57] shirts I'll tell you why because even
[1:35:00] the light Tabernacle cannot go in a
[1:35:02] rapture till they're ready to go to
[1:35:06] and no matter how we think we're
[1:35:10] prepared
[1:35:11] we cannot go until every predestinated
[1:35:15] seed has reached that point of maturity
[1:35:18] that God has ordained for them that's
[1:35:22] why we're concerned with the rest of the
[1:35:24] world we should have been matured and
[1:35:31] ripened in the presence of the Sun and
[1:35:34] got all the immaturity out of us a long
[1:35:35] time ago but instead now here's here's
[1:35:42] what he was talking with the Pentecostal
[1:35:44] church who is of age he's trying to get
[1:35:47] them to this point I wonder I wonder
[1:35:50] what would be said about the movement
[1:35:54] today the tudor reporting back to the
[1:36:00] father
[1:36:01] remember the tutors the Holy Ghost now
[1:36:03] not to gods is just is just a scenario
[1:36:06] is showing using a type here's the Holy
[1:36:10] Spirit wooing calling sending word
[1:36:13] messages tutoring we've been well taught
[1:36:22] there'd be you know gone are the days go
[1:36:26] to the days of the reel-to-reel tapes
[1:36:30] were that you listen to those tapes and
[1:36:35] you couldn't go back and find where you
[1:36:37] what you heard before gone are the days
[1:36:40] of the other cassette tapes where you
[1:36:44] know a library of them were were $10,000
[1:36:51] unaffordable you know go to the day's
[1:36:57] listen the message is in your hands
[1:37:01] I like something sister Helen said the
[1:37:06] other day to me
[1:37:07] you know when some were asking about you
[1:37:09] know I'm investing you know wondering
[1:37:12] what brother Tim would think about his
[1:37:14] investment in marijuana nobody should
[1:37:16] have to ask me that seriously you gotta
[1:37:25] ask me you don't know that where you
[1:37:29] been where you been what's what's on the
[1:37:36] tapes just listen to the tapes man I
[1:37:40] shouldn't have to tell you that you
[1:37:41] ought to know that hey man but oh to
[1:37:45] dead but today you know we wound up you
[1:37:47] know the church where it should be down
[1:37:49] so far down the road and it ain't
[1:37:53] because we don't have resources it ain't
[1:37:57] because we don't have the teaching or
[1:37:59] the message to turn the heart it's
[1:38:03] because the people have refused and just
[1:38:06] they just turned it into another Church
[1:38:09] meeting or another another gathering or
[1:38:11] whether social event this is not a
[1:38:14] social event I mean this is not another
[1:38:19] denominational gather this is where the
[1:38:21] body of Christ the church the bride
[1:38:24] meets together in heavenly places to
[1:38:28] hear the words and the here it's a slide
[1:38:36] but instead to church all separated and
[1:38:40] divided arguing and fussing disputing
[1:38:46] over little petty differences unbelief
[1:38:49] unthankful unholy without even natural
[1:38:53] affection when we should be in love with
[1:38:56] the father this is what brother Branham
[1:39:01] was talking about Zack forty fifty year
[1:39:03] old church bring it up today
[1:39:05] oh we are arrogant and dilatory and
[1:39:11] arguing our little religious differences
[1:39:14] splitting hairs and such nonsense our
[1:39:18] character are fussing fighting making a
[1:39:21] dick making differences separating
[1:39:23] Brotherhood
[1:39:24] there's no fellowship among they're
[1:39:27] jealous of each other I read what he
[1:39:29] said this is what this is what God was
[1:39:32] saying of the Pentecostal church mana
[1:39:35] and and the reason why they couldn't
[1:39:37] have the rapture I know what just said
[1:39:41] of me his children are separated by
[1:39:46] denominational barriers think about that
[1:39:50] and you think of denominations just
[1:39:52] being on there's something that's got a
[1:39:55] name and in a certain building there's
[1:39:57] got a certain headquarters no that ain't
[1:39:59] yet denomination is anything any Kingdom
[1:40:03] that sets us up up against the word and
[1:40:05] you could be a one-man denomination in
[1:40:08] fact of the matter is I want to just
[1:40:10] tell you you know you got that there are
[1:40:13] those that are indicted that was not in
[1:40:15] denomination because brother Brennan
[1:40:17] said I indict this generation and he
[1:40:21] said the denominations and many of the
[1:40:25] independence one of the ones who itself
[1:40:29] I'm not a denomination brother praise
[1:40:31] God we know we believe the message okay
[1:40:34] well then whoa what is all this
[1:40:36] separation I mean what is all this
[1:40:40] splitting hairs what is all this
[1:40:42] perverse teaching around you know at
[1:40:45] first at first you know in the message
[1:40:47] case he corrected false doctrines but
[1:40:50] unconverted men using their gifts have
[1:40:53] taken the message and perverted for the
[1:40:55] purpose of kingdom building they man
[1:40:59] they're even teaching perverse things
[1:41:02] that the days of miracles is past now
[1:41:05] can you imagine Tim can you imagine
[1:41:07] perverse things that God taught only
[1:41:09] brother Branham could pray for this
[1:41:10] thing oh you're not to have paralyzed oh
[1:41:12] we're not to sing only believe you know
[1:41:14] cuz that's brother Branham so all these
[1:41:16] other ideas that came along which were
[1:41:21] which were barriers and fences and
[1:41:24] denominational
[1:41:28] movement's member not walls and man
[1:41:35] Traverse things are you with me that the
[1:41:38] days of miracles are past well they
[1:41:40] better not be past
[1:41:41] we need miracles in this church this
[1:41:44] mortar we need divine healing but we
[1:41:48] also need soul healing which is even a
[1:41:50] greater divine healing hey man oh he
[1:41:56] said how they've made will accepted
[1:41:58] man-made dogma
[1:41:59] doctrine instead of the Bible the truth
[1:42:02] perverted right to them and they turn
[1:42:04] their backs and excuse me the truth
[1:42:06] presented right to them and they turned
[1:42:08] their backs and walk away from it there
[1:42:10] you are because their organization don't
[1:42:13] believe it and they know it's the Word
[1:42:15] of God and no other scripture in the
[1:42:17] Bible but that if it's truly the Word of
[1:42:20] God it'll be from Genesis to Revelation
[1:42:22] to be the same thing so so he says they
[1:42:26] build a tower that they thought that
[1:42:30] their organization could draw the whole
[1:42:32] world to them what about these towers
[1:42:36] that men have built that if you don't
[1:42:39] come here you're not gonna make it
[1:42:42] what Oh what about these towers if
[1:42:45] you're not on my hookup I think you
[1:42:47] better be on the hook-up you better be
[1:42:50] hooked up with Christ man and the holy
[1:42:53] spirit flowing down through your life
[1:42:55] that's the hook-up you need to be on a
[1:42:58] man but you but again you know they
[1:43:00] built himself a tower that they thought
[1:43:02] through their organization that can draw
[1:43:04] the whole world to them the truth
[1:43:07] presented right to them and they turn
[1:43:10] their backs and walk away from it there
[1:43:11] you are because their organization don't
[1:43:14] believe it your children can't even
[1:43:17] agree with one another long enough to
[1:43:20] have a meeting and then that's the truth
[1:43:23] you're not a meeting like we had the
[1:43:25] other day you know we're men of God what
[1:43:27] would become and preached under anointed
[1:43:30] and believers that claim to believe the
[1:43:32] same message wouldn't dare even gather
[1:43:34] in the same building with you how in the
[1:43:36] world is that going to come
[1:43:38] option how in that world or are they you
[1:43:41] know how in the world will with this
[1:43:43] kind of immaturity get us anywhere
[1:43:49] ecclesiastical walls petty differences
[1:43:53] we're broke up as bad as any of them not
[1:43:55] to do this is what I'm saying
[1:43:57] let me just say it we're broke up as bad
[1:44:00] as any other can't fellowship we've got
[1:44:03] these one man or two men organizations
[1:44:05] which are just as bad as one that
[1:44:08] numbers in the thousands and then
[1:44:11] littered around every message Church in
[1:44:14] there in every in every community
[1:44:16] there's little groups that refuse to
[1:44:18] fellowship and support a work of God I
[1:44:20] wonder what's gonna be one day when you
[1:44:23] have to give an account when you have to
[1:44:26] fast and before God and explain why I'm
[1:44:31] an men you know yeah I think about it
[1:44:35] kind of like this you know with people
[1:44:36] with their own little ideas you know
[1:44:39] there was a man one time that they say
[1:44:41] was discovered on an island he had been
[1:44:43] all over shipwrecked in that sea for
[1:44:46] years and years and years and thought he
[1:44:49] would never be found and finally one day
[1:44:51] he was discovered on this island so they
[1:44:55] were looking around to see how he has
[1:44:57] sustained himself so he was showing him
[1:45:01] the little different of us that he had
[1:45:03] and he said here's my house where I
[1:45:06] lived all right
[1:45:08] that's wonderful I don't you got three
[1:45:11] buildings here what's that 100 that's my
[1:45:13] church yeah okay you know that's where I
[1:45:16] go to worship right there that's my
[1:45:18] church I built that church for worship
[1:45:20] and as well what's that other buildings
[1:45:22] and that's where I used to go to church
[1:45:27] and that's about the way it is can't get
[1:45:32] along with yourselves
[1:45:34] so self-centered come on where's this
[1:45:39] maturity that we're going to need for a
[1:45:41] rapture I meant wait we separate over
[1:45:45] songs and over music and over Christmas
[1:45:48] over fellowship halls and you know we
[1:45:51] use quotes for reasons why or not to
[1:45:53] fellowship and divide rather than to
[1:45:56] bring us together
[1:46:00] hey man while brother Adam said when he
[1:46:04] when Satan get someone failing to to
[1:46:06] operate with the church someone failing
[1:46:08] and pulling off and getting it different
[1:46:10] that's a cancer in the church it's a
[1:46:13] devil in that person that's right and it
[1:46:15] closes the whole church to be sick over
[1:46:17] the best thing to do is how I was a
[1:46:20] spiritual operation oh man listen listen
[1:46:25] I I don't want to call anybody shucks
[1:46:27] and I don't want anybody to be said in
[1:46:28] fact as I say if that's where you are in
[1:46:32] your experience come on up you you know
[1:46:35] apply in the plant it can't change that
[1:46:38] from being a shock to a grain but you
[1:46:40] can I mean you if that's where you're at
[1:46:44] because there is a separation that is
[1:46:47] going on in this day but it isn't the
[1:46:50] grain that's pulling away it's this shop
[1:46:53] pulling away from the grain and when you
[1:46:57] see the pulling away and the perverse
[1:47:01] teaching you can see it ain't nothing
[1:47:03] but shock and like I said you know I'm
[1:47:08] not condemning if you're shuck come on
[1:47:10] up you don't have to remain there hey
[1:47:16] man as his brother Brandon would say and
[1:47:19] thirst him for life the pleasure of a
[1:47:22] Christian is serving the Lord at the
[1:47:24] house of the Lord you don't have to sign
[1:47:28] no cards you can't open the door quick
[1:47:31] enough what he's referring to that he
[1:47:34] said he had a pastor friend who was
[1:47:37] having trouble getting people to come to
[1:47:39] church now you know we used to didn't
[1:47:42] have that problem but a message stirred

[1:51:01] faithful and I'm not knocking you and
[1:51:03] I'm not knocking anybody I'm talking
[1:51:05] about the spiritual environment that is
[1:51:09] going on in this last day of the Leodis
[1:51:12] zeal spirit that wants to take over the
[1:51:15] body and if the members love one another
[1:51:18] instead of just mid put a little clicks
[1:51:21] and pulling away from the church if you
[1:51:23] love one another so much it just hurts
[1:51:25] your heart until you get together again
[1:51:28] that's the way it should be
[1:51:30] hey ma'am you know God God is gonna
[1:51:34] happen all that people he's going to
[1:51:37] somehow another get a pride out of this
[1:51:39] mess I don't know how he's gonna do it
[1:51:43] but there's somebody gonna come to
[1:51:45] Maternity that's somebody gonna walk
[1:51:47] down the middle of the road brother
[1:51:51] Brendan would say and this goes back to
[1:51:54] Timothy sermon Wednesday night great
[1:51:57] sermon God is able of these stones to
[1:52:00] rise children to Abraham's God's able to
[1:52:04] heal an opossum or fish or anything if
[1:52:10] he will bring his message forth
[1:52:13] and the people won't believe it God can
[1:52:16] raise up a possum - believe it
[1:52:18] hallelujah God can raise a dead fish he
[1:52:22] can raise a dead opossum he can do
[1:52:24] anything he wants to but what a rebuke
[1:52:26] to this generation when they stumble
[1:52:28] over it and fuss about it and said you
[1:52:30] didn't do this and didn't do that and
[1:52:32] God sent a simple animal in I wonder one
[1:52:36] day when we when some of us get there
[1:52:39] even a little opossum won't be a witness
[1:52:40] against us
[1:52:41] he cared that possum came to the prophet
[1:52:44] of God the possum came for healing come
[1:52:47] on and many of the church members
[1:52:49] you know they got they're too busy to do
[1:52:52] something else you know let me just ask
[1:52:57] the question what are men accomplishing
[1:53:01] were these little cliques what are you
[1:53:05] what are you doing are you accomplishing
[1:53:07] anything for the kingdom of God
[1:53:10] you just want to ask you your little
[1:53:12] clique one or two three four or maybe a
[1:53:16] little family group or whatever how many
[1:53:19] souls are you baptizing how many are
[1:53:25] getting filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:53:28] what kind of mission outreach are you
[1:53:31] having so then is what you're doing
[1:53:36] fulfilling the Great Commission is it
[1:53:39] sending the gospel out to every nation
[1:53:40] kindred tongue and people
[1:53:42] is it accomplishing that well I'll tell
[1:53:46] you if you're they've accomplished and
[1:53:47] that I would get out of that click and
[1:53:49] find something with life in it it's
[1:53:52] gotta have the power of God moving in it
[1:53:55] amen brother we've got to come together
[1:53:58] where there is healing where there is
[1:54:00] miracles where there a soul saved where
[1:54:03] there are people baptized where the
[1:54:05] gospel is preached where missions are
[1:54:07] set out it's gotta be alive but oh we
[1:54:17] pull away because sermon they just the
[1:54:19] way we like it or Church order isn't
[1:54:21] done a certain way or the song service
[1:54:23] and choice of song ain't our taste
[1:54:26] random said in rejected king the holy
[1:54:29] spirit wants us to have no fences no
[1:54:33] boundary lines he wants us to be one in
[1:54:37] him we are children brothers God doesn't
[1:54:40] separate his children I'll give them one
[1:54:44] would give this when cornbread and beans
[1:54:46] another ice-cream and pie he doesn't do
[1:54:49] that he doesn't let this one starve to
[1:54:50] death in the other he feeds them all at
[1:54:52] the same table the Holy Spirit should
[1:54:55] lead the church I wouldn't sit in a
[1:54:58] place where I was starving a man come to
[1:55:02] the fountain come to a place find
[1:55:04] somewhere God's gotta have somebody
[1:55:06] somewhere a man but they don't want it
[1:55:11] that way that one the King don't wanna
[1:55:12] be like the rest of the world when the
[1:55:14] Pentecostal church the Holy Spirit first
[1:55:16] fell 50 something years ago if they just
[1:55:19] would have let it alone
[1:55:20] and let God add the church daily as what
[1:55:23] would be saved it would been like the
[1:55:24] APUs it was an apostolic age but we had
[1:55:27] to draw fences we had to be like the
[1:55:30] rest of them with the Methodists as a
[1:55:32] denomination we must be and here
[1:55:35] somebody come along Jesus is coming on a
[1:55:37] white cloud no he's coming on the white
[1:55:40] horse oh all right we'll just separate
[1:55:41] and get me a group you get a group and
[1:55:44] what difference what difference does it
[1:55:45] make he said he's coming in how it
[1:55:48] doesn't matter how he's come in to think
[1:55:49] of it is are you ready to go with him
[1:55:51] when it comes that's the main thing
[1:55:53] don't matter how he comes what for me
[1:55:56] comes in unless just be ready to go but
[1:56:01] they split hairs on little bitty things
[1:56:03] and form another organization and that's
[1:56:06] just the way the world did it so then he
[1:56:10] goes on is it and then how they're
[1:56:11] making fun of your people that's been
[1:56:15] called out and filled with the Holy
[1:56:17] Ghost they don't believe in the
[1:56:20] supernatural anymore these are the
[1:56:22] tutors report about a church that it's
[1:56:25] trying to get to me nerdy and then they
[1:56:28] they they're making fun of your people
[1:56:31] that's been called out and filled with
[1:56:33] the spirit they don't believe in the
[1:56:35] supernatural anymore oh listen brother
[1:56:39] Branham would
[1:56:40] that in the message respects sometimes
[1:56:43] you know we ought to just go and just
[1:56:44] listen to some of these sermons respects
[1:56:48] how you ought to respect he said even
[1:56:51] maybe you don't think it's exactly right
[1:56:53] respect it you don't exactly agree with
[1:56:59] it you think it's a little
[1:57:00] he said respect it and God in the in the
[1:57:04] same way will respect you in return amen
[1:57:08] so he said when we received the Holy
[1:57:10] Ghost is not shaking hands with your
[1:57:12] pastor receiving the Holy Ghost is
[1:57:14] receiving Christ into you because he's
[1:57:16] God's messenger for the day the Holy
[1:57:19] Ghost is God's messenger and we must
[1:57:21] respect him when he comes don't say he
[1:57:24] look at that woman shouting there and
[1:57:27] crying and tears run running up down her
[1:57:30] cheeks look at that man there shaking
[1:57:32] his hands and trembling and crying you
[1:57:34] know what that is that's a bunch of what
[1:57:36] evolution listen you're blaspheming the
[1:57:40] Holy Ghost you've got to respect that I
[1:57:45] wonder how many have blaspheme seeing
[1:57:50] God move and see him God working and
[1:57:53] seeing the supernatural come down amen
[1:57:58] but because he wasn't do a song you
[1:58:00] approved up or you didn't like this or
[1:58:01] you didn't like that or you didn't like
[1:58:03] how long the preacher preached and you
[1:58:05] saw that you wind up making fun of
[1:58:07] the whole thing
[1:58:07] and blaspheming and calling it of the
[1:58:14] devil listen the Holy Ghost is not a
[1:58:18] sensation the Holy Ghost it is the
[1:58:21] Spirit of God a in action in you and
[1:58:25] that Holy Spirit and action will cause
[1:58:28] you to keep the Word of God
[1:58:30] oh man it's not it's a life it's not a
[1:58:33] motion it's not of fleshly evidence but
[1:58:36] it's the person Jesus Christ the Word of
[1:58:39] God established in your heart to quicken
[1:58:43] every word of this age so you see it's
[1:58:46] got to be an action he said not so much
[1:58:50] in demonstrations but
[1:58:53] and man so again we we have a restored
[1:58:58] truth we have the restored truths of the
[1:59:00] new birth you may remember Jesus
[1:59:03] originally used that term it was it was
[1:59:07] his first doctrine that he preached in
[1:59:10] John chapter 3 and verse 3 he said
[1:59:12] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[1:59:15] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:59:17] God this is Jesus first doctrine so the
[1:59:21] new birth that was taught by Jesus can
[1:59:24] only come by true repentance may public
[1:59:28] by water baptism which is an outward
[1:59:30] confession of an inward happening and
[1:59:32] then by receiving the Holy Spirit this
[1:59:34] is why he says in verse 5 when he
[1:59:36] explains it because Nicodemus wondered
[1:59:39] how can this be so he said in verse 5
[1:59:42] verily I say unto you except a man be
[1:59:45] born of water and of the spirit he
[1:59:48] cannot enter the kingdom of God so Jesus
[1:59:52] would when he would say this it was a it
[1:59:55] was promised tillie yet a promise for
[1:59:58] the Holy Spirit had not yet been given
[2:00:00] and the Holy Spirit would not come until
[2:00:03] a future date on the day of Pentecost
[2:00:07] amen when the Spirit of God would be
[2:00:10] poured out for the first time on all
[2:00:14] flesh yeah I understand you know there
[2:00:17] were men in the Bible that would called
[2:00:19] filled with the spirit who were anointed
[2:00:21] by the Holy Ghost but the attina could
[2:00:24] not come tabernacle man until the change
[2:00:28] of a nature come and until that old
[2:00:31] nature was killed and wiped out the
[2:00:34] deity of Christ could not come into him
[2:00:36] so he could anoint men of the Old
[2:00:39] Testament about but to be truly filled
[2:00:41] as in the term of the New Testament it
[2:00:43] was impossible until Calvary and when
[2:00:47] Jesus died on the cross and when he his
[2:00:51] spirit his life he was here that nature
[2:00:54] came back to dwell in man again remember
[2:00:58] the blood of Old Testament could not
[2:01:01] remit sin
[2:01:03] are you with me it could not prepare a
[2:01:06] man he couldn't it was as brother
[2:01:08] Brennan said there was only one birth
[2:01:10] under the Old Testament so therefore you
[2:01:12] had to be born in the lineage of Abraham
[2:01:15] because there's only one birth but he
[2:01:17] said in the new birth that's not true we
[2:01:20] have another birth now that brings out
[2:01:22] all the cause hallelujah now so again
[2:01:28] you see he would say in John 7 2013 8 he
[2:01:33] that believeth on me as the scripture
[2:01:35] has said out of his belly shall flow
[2:01:39] rivers of living water so again if you
[2:01:44] believe on him as the scripture says to
[2:01:48] believe on him then when there's that
[2:01:52] true faith on the inside when there's a
[2:01:55] reality of a living God then out of your
[2:01:58] innermost being will flow rivers of
[2:02:02] living water but this he spake of the
[2:02:06] Spirit which they that believe on him
[2:02:08] should receive for the Holy Ghost has
[2:02:10] not yet given because Jesus is not yet
[2:02:13] glorified and jesus told His disciples
[2:02:15] remember to wait in Jerusalem until they
[2:02:18] receive this promise from the father
[2:02:20] let's look in the Luke chapter 24 49 hey
[2:02:25] man I've got just a little further to go
[2:02:27] in fact I got a lot further to go but I
[2:02:29] don't know how far on this highway we'll
[2:02:31] get today
[2:02:32] I wish we'd get to glory man Luke 24:49
[2:02:42] behold I send the promise of my father
[2:02:44] upon you but tarry that means wait in
[2:02:48] the city of Jerusalem until you be
[2:02:50] endued with power from on high
[2:02:52] now they had believed on the Lord they'd
[2:02:55] even been they've even were and went
[2:02:58] through works of sanctification but they
[2:03:00] needed that power the powerful to live
[2:03:05] an overcoming victorious life now what
[2:03:09] they had before Pentecost did not bring
[2:03:13] conversion
[2:03:15] because of Luke 22:31 he said Simon
[2:03:17] behold Satan has desired to have you
[2:03:20] that he may sift you as wheat but I
[2:03:22] prayed for you 22:32 and that you'd that
[2:03:26] faith fail not and with our converted
[2:03:30] strengthen that brother
[2:03:32] amen so you know here was Peter a liar
[2:03:36] he was a Peter but a betrayer yourself I
[2:03:41] 101 who would would deny the Lord
[2:03:44] somebody with me curse but he needed
[2:03:49] something that would hold him in an hour
[2:03:52] of trial and he didn't have it hey man
[2:03:57] Jesus that I prayed for you that your
[2:03:58] faith fail not and when you are
[2:04:01] converted because this is a fruit of
[2:04:04] Jesus Prayer I gotta get this one to
[2:04:06] Pentecost because if I don't get him to
[2:04:09] Pentecost he will have a life of failure
[2:04:11] all the time even though he believes on
[2:04:14] me and he confesses me and Savior he
[2:04:16] needs that in Douma of power to give him
[2:04:20] and overcome in life a man when you are
[2:04:24] converted strengthen your brother God
[2:04:27] hiding himself in simplicity Jesus told
[2:04:29] Peter the night of the material he was
[2:04:31] already saved now if you're converted
[2:04:34] strengthen your brethren that's right
[2:04:35] you accepted Christ as your Savior but
[2:04:38] when you're converted is when you're
[2:04:39] really changed that's right and he
[2:04:42] wasn't changed yet he cursed before the
[2:04:44] Lord he denied him and everything but
[2:04:45] after his conversion after thou art
[2:04:49] converted strengthen your brethren is
[2:04:51] that right that's what the scripture
[2:04:52] says that makes it right Jesus told
[2:04:55] Peter that followed him cast out Devils
[2:04:57] done miracles everything you're not
[2:04:59] converted yet but after you're converted
[2:05:02] didn't strengthen your brethren there
[2:05:05] was not a new birth until Jesus himself
[2:05:09] was filled with the Holy Spirit and then
[2:05:12] from that Holy Spirit there he himself
[2:05:15] there gave it on the day of Pentecost
[2:05:17] for man to receive of the Spirit of God
[2:05:20] it was impossible before that time now
[2:05:24] that's 1:8 and you shall receive power
[2:05:26] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[2:05:29] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[2:05:32] both in Jerusalem you know how your
[2:05:35] witness a guy's not a witness that said
[2:05:38] well I have a friend that said I he saw
[2:05:40] that act and that accident out there
[2:05:42] you're not a witness your friend is the
[2:05:45] witness
[2:05:46] you're not the witness in order to be a
[2:05:48] witness it had to happen to you it had
[2:05:51] to be your experience and that's exactly
[2:05:54] what it is you cannot have Mama's
[2:05:56] experience daddys experience pastors
[2:05:59] experience you must have your own
[2:06:01] experience are you with me
[2:06:03] hey man so so again I'm you shall be
[2:06:06] witnesses first chapter 2 verse 1 when
[2:06:09] the day of Pentecost was fully come that
[2:06:11] we're all in one Accord and suddenly
[2:06:14] there came a sound from heaven as a
[2:06:16] rushing mighty wind and it filled all
[2:06:19] the house where they were sitting and
[2:06:20] there appeared unto them cloven tongues
[2:06:23] like as of fire as it sat upon each one
[2:06:26] them and they were all filled with the
[2:06:29] Holy Ghost and begin to speak with
[2:06:31] tongues as the Spirit gave them
[2:06:33] utterance
[2:06:33] now this is where it was this is what
[2:06:36] everybody knew was the new birth
[2:06:39] oh man you had to have all three
[2:06:41] elements of yet on the water the blood
[2:06:44] and the spirit and then you had to be
[2:06:47] justified in other words you had to make
[2:06:49] a profession of faith and say I believe
[2:06:51] Christ is my Savior and in that day to
[2:06:54] profess Christ menu and you can be
[2:06:57] crucified and man you could be under
[2:07:00] terrible persecution today it's a
[2:07:02] popular thing today oh yeah I believe
[2:07:04] Jesus - I accept him as Savior it's more
[2:07:07] than that it's more than a mental
[2:07:10] conception man here it is our repentance
[2:07:14] our turning around and receiving the
[2:07:17] Spirit of God in your life that's the
[2:07:19] new birth water blood and spirit hey man
[2:07:24] notice um dude during the Dark Ages of
[2:07:27] truth in a new birth become lost and the
[2:07:31] new birth becomes only comes only by
[2:07:34] being baptized and
[2:07:36] the true new birth comes only by being
[2:07:39] baptized filled sealed with the Holy
[2:07:41] Ghost but during the ages this truth was
[2:07:44] gradually lost and God then restored it
[2:07:48] back again one step at a time the
[2:07:51] Catholic Church would start out saying
[2:07:54] in order to be born into a Catholic
[2:07:57] family on a you know makes you
[2:08:00] automatically a Christian and being
[2:08:02] baptized as an infant into the church
[2:08:05] that was all this necessary for
[2:08:07] salvation early Baptist believers
[2:08:10] realize the need for a person to be
[2:08:13] baptized as an adult and so they they
[2:08:17] were called rebaptised began the end and
[2:08:21] these revived toddlers became born-again
[2:08:24] when they were baptized after making a
[2:08:26] public confession of Jesus as Savior by
[2:08:30] baptism with the my immersion so to the
[2:08:33] Baptist born-again meant making a public
[2:08:35] confession Martin Luther you know
[2:08:38] brought about a Reformation declaring
[2:08:41] faith as the method of being justified
[2:08:44] or declared righteous by God he brought
[2:08:47] it away that dude penance crawling on
[2:08:50] your hands and knees and praying and
[2:08:52] saying the Hail Marys that that would
[2:08:54] not save you works would not do it
[2:08:56] you're justified by faith you're
[2:08:58] declared righteous by faith but simply
[2:09:01] believing you receive Christ as your
[2:09:03] personal Savior and then then again you
[2:09:06] know it goes on the method has come
[2:09:09] along and and they said well you know
[2:09:11] that's true but you've got to live a
[2:09:13] holy life too and so if something's got
[2:09:16] to happen to you for this holiness to
[2:09:19] come and after you have believed on
[2:09:21] Christ and they actually called it the
[2:09:23] second blessing but again it was not the
[2:09:27] new birth as Jesus taught it then
[2:09:30] Pentecost come along and they said in
[2:09:32] the Souza's free well you got to speak
[2:09:34] in tongues like today don't they a
[2:09:36] Pentecost and many of them spoke in
[2:09:38] other tongues and they said this is a
[2:09:40] new birth and it wasn't it was receiving
[2:09:45] a gift of the Spirit
[2:09:47] and not the spirit himself and they
[2:09:51] would get overjoyed and speak in tongues
[2:09:53] and shout and jump and still cheat on
[2:09:55] their on their wife or their husband are
[2:09:59] you with me I don't mean all of them
[2:10:01] they were godly people in all of these
[2:10:02] movements are you with me but many of
[2:10:05] them did speak in tongues just like this
[2:10:06] said and could live right why it wasn't
[2:10:09] the Holy Ghost he was a gift of the
[2:10:11] Spirit but the message of Malachi for is
[2:10:17] somebody with me now and then this
[2:10:20] message is to turn the heart a man to
[2:10:25] bring the people back to the original
[2:10:28] faith and my three original new birth
[2:10:34] now here we come right now you know the
[2:10:40] Baptist said well like you know like
[2:10:42] maybe some of them on the day of
[2:10:44] Pentecost well we've waited so many days
[2:10:46] now and and we waited long enough I I
[2:10:49] believe I believe with witnesses
[2:10:51] accepted by faith but no he said you
[2:10:54] know wonder that one of the others said
[2:10:55] uh-huh wait a minute it ain't no except
[2:10:57] about faith he said we would get power
[2:11:01] the Holy Ghost would come and it ain't
[2:11:03] count let's wait a little longer a man
[2:11:06] and so so get again brother Branham said
[2:11:09] wouldn't you seek the Holy Ghost you do
[2:11:11] the same hey man yeah you wait a little
[2:11:15] longer
[2:11:16] I'm going to you're filled with the Holy
[2:11:18] Spirit till you're dead to sin he said
[2:11:21] you can't accept it my praise you have
[2:11:23] to accept Christ by faith that's exactly
[2:11:26] right and you accept the Holy Ghost by
[2:11:28] faith but then let the Holy Spirit come
[2:11:31] and give the circumcision as a witness
[2:11:34] that he has accepted your faith a man so
[2:11:40] he said we must wait on the Holy Spirit
[2:11:42] is somebody with me now until it's done
[2:11:46] something
[2:11:49] hello until it's done something not
[2:11:53] necessary cuz we spoke in tongues not
[2:11:56] because we dance now because we got
[2:11:58] emotional or we shout it but until we
[2:12:00] are changed until something actually
[2:12:04] happening I don't care what form it
[2:12:07] comes in just so it happens that's the
[2:12:11] main thing
[2:12:12] and my people people are looking for
[2:12:14] something oh well I speaking on when I
[2:12:17] shout well I'd answer well we'll have
[2:12:19] this chill or will I have this sensation
[2:12:22] or you know I'll I just believe I'm just
[2:12:24] gonna believe I got it no wait until
[2:12:26] it's done something until your life is
[2:12:30] changed you're a new creature in Christ
[2:12:33] and if your life has been changed what
[2:12:36] they rejoice in that I'm on quit whining
[2:12:41] and pouting and worrying and fearing if
[2:12:43] your life has been changed and your
[2:12:45] heart is set on Calvary and your dare in
[2:12:48] the middle of the road quit the whining
[2:12:50] and the crime and the worrying and the
[2:12:52] fear and believe that God has done what
[2:12:55] he said hey man when he the person the
[2:13:06] immortal spirit of Christ comes your
[2:13:09] personal Savior and changes you and
[2:13:12] throws your views here's what you want
[2:13:14] your views straight in the Calvary to
[2:13:18] this word then something happens
[2:13:22] something has happened no one will have
[2:13:25] to tell you about it you'll know when it
[2:13:29] happens it is an emotion no emotion
[2:13:37] accompanies it it isn't sensation though
[2:13:41] it is sensational now
[2:13:48] here again remember we started out the
[2:13:51] holy ghosts
[2:13:52] without them the mystery of the Holy
[2:13:55] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:13:57] without sensation now watch this and
[2:14:00] this is a sixth seal some months later
[2:14:02] now in the seals here all it is it isn't
[2:14:07] emotion let's get it straight what the
[2:14:13] Holy Ghost is not it is not a shout it
[2:14:18] is not a jump let's go to the other side
[2:14:21] it's not even an education into the
[2:14:24] message it's not a profession of faith
[2:14:28] the Holy Ghost is not that the Holy
[2:14:31] Ghost is not tongues that's a gift from
[2:14:35] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not a
[2:14:39] holy dance you can dance and dance in
[2:14:43] the spirit the real spirit and still not
[2:14:47] have the Holy Ghost
[2:14:48] it is not a sensation but it is
[2:14:53] sensational it is not an emotion but it
[2:14:58] has emotion with it
[2:15:01] you cannot get it and not know it now
[2:15:06] you might be taught wrong and you know
[2:15:10] therefore be confused but you can't you
[2:15:12] can't have it and something not have
[2:15:14] happen to you here again it is in the
[2:15:17] seal book
[2:15:18] I didn't finish it here all it is it is
[2:15:22] an emotion though emotion a convincing
[2:15:25] it just like I said smoking drinking
[2:15:28] isn't sin
[2:15:29] it's the attribute of sin it shows you
[2:15:32] don't believe but when you truly believe
[2:15:35] in your heart and you know that on the
[2:15:37] basis of where you're sitting there you
[2:15:38] accept it with all your heart
[2:15:40] something's gonna happen right there
[2:15:42] it's gonna happen then you can stand as
[2:15:44] a witness to it that something happened
[2:15:47] oh man it happens an inmate every kind
[2:15:52] of different forms as brother man said I
[2:15:55] don't care how you get it
[2:15:57] just as long as you get it you said what
[2:16:02] I want to sign by the gym well you will
[2:16:04] believe the word
[2:16:06] hey man you welcome subject to it it'll
[2:16:13] cause an accident you and Anna bring
[2:16:16] your body septic to the Holy Ghost
[2:16:20] somebody help me preach hey man he'll
[2:16:23] make you agree with the word hey man
[2:16:29] now again you know that the Methodist
[2:16:32] said when we sounded we had it but they
[2:16:34] didn't the Nazarene said they lived holy
[2:16:36] they had it but they didn't the
[2:16:39] pinnacles who said we speak in tongues
[2:16:41] we got it but they didn't god unfolding
[2:16:44] himself not in sensations
[2:16:48] that's sensations yet with it you see
[2:16:52] the place he just gets it so humble till
[2:16:56] anybody can see any of you if you don't
[2:16:58] try to put inject your own mind to it
[2:17:00] and your own thoughts it's God
[2:17:02] so you see God unfold in himself not in
[2:17:06] a sensation but in sensations with it
[2:17:09] now what is this sensation a feeling
[2:17:15] something happens I've been touched by
[2:17:21] deity well I got it and didn't know it
[2:17:24] well you mean you got it and it didn't
[2:17:26] change you you got it and end was the
[2:17:31] same person now all the time and just
[2:17:32] pretend you got it no you got it if you
[2:17:37] got it it changed and that's what you
[2:17:40] want to look for in your life not how
[2:17:43] high you jump at the altar not how much
[2:17:45] you speak in other tongues and you are
[2:17:48] the one is vegan tongues Paul said so
[2:17:52] Paul said I would did you all spoke in
[2:17:53] tongues rather than she prophesied a man
[2:17:56] for big mouth speaking in tongues you
[2:17:58] ought to desire spiritual gifts but
[2:18:02] listen even though that should be your
[2:18:04] desire that
[2:18:06] then your gift is not is is not your
[2:18:09] evidence the evidence you're looking for
[2:18:12] is your walking dead this road calling
[2:18:17] from both sides not fanatic not legal
[2:18:26] balanced are you with me now brother
[2:18:33] branham's head in world falling apart in
[2:18:35] 63 you people stand-in here now look
[2:18:38] don't you rely upon some emotion
[2:18:41] although it has emotions with it you see
[2:18:50] we come to a point where that the church
[2:18:54] goes all the way to extreme well we just
[2:18:57] accept the message and believe it well
[2:19:00] no that's just being able to read the
[2:19:02] tokens got to be on display the life of
[2:19:05] Christ has to be on display to be
[2:19:06] attained on display in your life you
[2:19:08] ain't got it the blood hadn't been shed
[2:19:11] and been hadn't been applied for you all
[2:19:15] right now so again he tells he tells us
[2:19:20] in the deceive Church by the world the
[2:19:22] reason people go on enjoy an
[2:19:23] organization substitute a handshake
[2:19:25] instead of the new birth they're wantin
[2:19:27] to bypass a new birth they don't want
[2:19:30] the new birth and they know we teach it
[2:19:32] in the Bible so they want to substitute
[2:19:34] something for it and if Pentecostal
[2:19:36] people are just as bad trying to
[2:19:38] substitute something they want it in
[2:19:40] class it must be so classy we shake
[2:19:43] hands and join the church and be
[2:19:44] sprinkled and baptized or something
[2:19:47] they're afraid of the new birth and I
[2:19:50] believe sometimes I sometimes believe
[2:19:52] that Branum Tabernacle is getting afraid
[2:19:54] of it now we know all what a birth is I
[2:19:57] don't care where it is or whereabouts
[2:20:00] it's a mess if a baby is born on a ship
[2:20:03] pile on a hard floor and a pink
[2:20:04] decorator Hospital roof it's a mess
[2:20:07] anyway a bare birth of the cat births of
[2:20:09] anything is a mess and the new birth is
[2:20:12] nothing less
[2:20:14] mess but people get so starchy we'll go
[2:20:18] over here where they SiC hands we'll go
[2:20:20] over here where they don't ball and cry
[2:20:21] and beat on the altar and cry out you
[2:20:24] don't want to be too we want to you want
[2:20:26] to be too human
[2:20:27] what we need is birth down out to bring
[2:20:32] forth spiritual bring forth life now do
[2:20:36] you see now this is unchanged you come
[2:20:38] all the way down to birth pains in 1965
[2:20:41] this whole thought is unchanged he said
[2:20:44] a baby if it's just born by still birth
[2:20:47] no sound no emotion that's a dead baby
[2:20:50] and that's what's a matter with the
[2:20:53] church today the system we got too many
[2:20:56] stillborn children and I'm gonna say it
[2:20:59] again
[2:21:00] this is why we have had fallen away
[2:21:02] around the message people walking back
[2:21:06] out in the world to send the smoking
[2:21:09] drinking or denomination or whatever why
[2:21:12] because too many stillborn babies and
[2:21:15] the Turks they didn't come all the way
[2:21:18] to Calgary they didn't come all the way
[2:21:20] doing the breath of God came in their
[2:21:23] relevance of what they need is a gospel
[2:21:25] spanking amen like a baby when it's born
[2:21:28] if it doesn't bring the doctor sakes
[2:21:31] expects it does something try to get it
[2:21:33] breathing oh man the old-fashioned
[2:21:37] doctor would just give it he would call
[2:21:39] it a protoplasm a stimulation posterior
[2:21:42] stimulation and he get that baby there
[2:21:45] to move in and respond in reaction
[2:21:48] crying out man he said you cry out in
[2:21:52] the night no language a man whatever we
[2:21:57] can't have stillborn children he would
[2:22:00] go right over to the place and and and
[2:22:02] and listen if you think this is is it
[2:22:04] not a problem in message churches today
[2:22:07] you're you're mistaken
[2:22:08] and man we found that we have had an s
[2:22:11] full of rotten eggs and we've made them
[2:22:14] deacons and trustees and preachers and
[2:22:17] everything else and gave them position
[2:22:19] and everything else and we found out
[2:22:21] that they were never with the make
[2:22:25] I meant so therefore they are nests full
[2:22:27] of rotten egg now then the Burstyn and
[2:22:30] causing to speak everywhere spread
[2:22:33] around the internet and everywhere else
[2:22:35] us speaking the churches separation and
[2:22:38] problems everywhere why because people
[2:22:40] didn't get with the mate they didn't
[2:22:43] receive that german life on the inside
[2:22:46] of them and it produced a hybrid
[2:22:50] christian a hybrid product that ever
[2:22:54] little just sees it comes along they
[2:22:56] catch it every little spiritual disease
[2:22:59] it comes along they they're affected by
[2:23:02] it pulled over here and they're unstable
[2:23:05] but a genuine original plant does not
[2:23:09] have to be sprayed bugs won't get on it
[2:23:12] is it's not you know it's if that
[2:23:14] hothouse plant he said that you have to
[2:23:16] have two sprays and what you need is an
[2:23:20] old rigid is an original old digging out
[2:23:24] and tearing down a man as i said let's
[2:23:29] not clean out the nest and start over
[2:23:32] again that's right you can make deacons
[2:23:35] out of them but everything else but
[2:23:37] they'll never do no good
[2:23:38] pat him on the back and call him brother
[2:23:40] but until they're born again of the
[2:23:42] spirit of god they're just a nest full
[2:23:45] of rotten eggs and it'll never hatch
[2:23:47] we need the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:23:50] and he said i don't mean a dry handshake
[2:23:56] in other words I don't need you somebody
[2:23:58] I believe the message we need to dine
[2:24:03] out we need an old-fashioned birth
[2:24:07] remember sin becomes dead and myth as
[2:24:10] midnight a man now
[2:24:13] so again remember isn't it's neither
[2:24:16] side scholarly or emotional it's the
[2:24:19] middle of the road a man some some will
[2:24:23] get right there and and not ever make
[2:24:26] the middle of the road but the middle
[2:24:28] road is a sane sensible born-again
[2:24:31] spirit led endowed Church of
[2:24:34] living God going straight down the road
[2:24:37] to Christ the real one coming from the
[2:24:40] both sides one went one way - and went
[2:24:43] the other chose fanaticism either
[2:24:44] scholarly too stiff to bow and then know
[2:24:47] more about the word than they know about
[2:24:49] the author - no the word is not life but
[2:24:52] to know his life to know him you don't
[2:24:55] have to be a scholar you have to be a
[2:24:57] submitted person hey man now just in
[2:25:06] case you're wondering brother Branham
[2:25:08] felt like it was safer to err on the
[2:25:12] fanatical side then it was on the
[2:25:15] scholarly stiff starchy side where
[2:25:20] ninety percent a message churches
[2:25:23] happened to be falling off today you
[2:25:30] don't think so
[2:25:31] brother Brent's talked about he said I'm
[2:25:34] more of a fraid of a person that's
[2:25:36] afraid then I am the person that is a
[2:25:39] fanatic
[2:25:40] oh my I'd rather have a little wildfire
[2:25:46] then no fire at all sure I would I'd
[2:25:50] rather be around a fire that's popping
[2:25:52] and jumping anytime if the world's cold
[2:25:55] than to be around an iceberg
[2:25:59] don't pay to fire you get you can't get
[2:26:02] one by painted fire you've got to have
[2:26:04] some real fire so many of us would pay
[2:26:07] the fire you know this is what happened
[2:26:09] 40 years ago brother we gotta have that
[2:26:12] same fire right here in our church we
[2:26:14] can talk about the pillar of fire
[2:26:16] brother Brendan's meeting the pillars I
[2:26:18] better be in this meeting
[2:26:19] oh man your honor being leading the
[2:26:21] church today moving among the people
[2:26:25] healing the sick casting out Devils
[2:26:27] [Applause]
[2:26:29] bringing people to Christ you say well
[2:26:33] I'm afraid I'll get a little fanatic
[2:26:34] brother branham's word I'd rather have a
[2:26:36] little fanaticism than to be still and
[2:26:39] do nothing I sure would
[2:26:46] said I was preaching one night the woman
[2:26:48] got to screaming and shouting said a
[2:26:50] Baptist brother told me next day I was
[2:26:52] enjoying your message Billy until that
[2:26:55] woman got to screaming I said you know
[2:26:57] what it made children down my back he's
[2:27:00] a brother you're living the quietest
[2:27:02] world you'll ever live in if you go to
[2:27:04] hell there's gonna be weeping and
[2:27:06] wailing and gnashing of teeth if you go
[2:27:07] to heaven there's going to be screaming
[2:27:09] and shouting all the time
[2:27:11] what man he said that made chills run
[2:27:14] down your back what will it do when you
[2:27:16] get to heaven while you're freeze to
[2:27:17] death when you get there you'll be so
[2:27:20] out of place and man we ought to be in
[2:27:23] here the way we would be in heaven we
[2:27:26] oughta what's appear like they do in
[2:27:28] heaven we ought to sing here like the
[2:27:31] sing in heaven we are to dance and shout
[2:27:33] like they do in heaven
[2:27:36] hallelujah he said God is an object of
[2:27:39] worship and he said heaven you'd be so
[2:27:41] out of plow out of place for even angels

[2:27:51] Almighty holy holy holy you think it was
[2:27:55] a quite holy holy holy no it was
[2:27:59] screaming until the post of the temple

[2:28:39] anything I honor the Pentecostal people
[2:28:41] far is to let loose and worship God

[2:28:53] anything if anything for any reason I
[2:28:57] honor the Pentecostal people for is to
[2:29:00] let loose and worship God what about
[2:29:04] that you backslidden mushy people today
[2:29:07] don't know how to turn loose and worship

[2:29:15] kings and the Lord of lords and he
[2:29:17] deserves our worship back he deserves
[2:29:20] our praise
[2:29:27] your your prophet said the reason the
[2:29:31] reason people don't believe in shouting
[2:29:33] but will scream in a ballgame is because
[2:29:36] women top such things have been kept
[2:29:39] away from the glory of the presence of
[2:29:41] the Lord Jesus that gives him that
[2:29:44] satisfied portion hallelujah hallelujah
[2:29:53] it oughta make the joy bells rolled down
[2:29:56] on the inside
[2:29:57] amen to know we've been called to
[2:30:01] worship hey man
[2:30:07] brother Branham would talk about the
[2:30:09] nightingale he said I heard an old
[2:30:12] Nightingale would sing outside my window
[2:30:16] and he said he would just sing to the
[2:30:19] top of his voice at night and he said I
[2:30:22] got to readin upon him and he said the
[2:30:25] reason when I've ever studied him said
[2:30:28] the nightingale and when he sings he
[2:30:32] looks around and he sees one star and as
[2:30:37] long as he can see one star could be a
[2:30:41] dark cloudy dismal night but a
[2:30:44] nightingale will start singing if he can
[2:30:47] just see one star he will sing at the
[2:30:50] top of his voice why he said he knows
[2:30:53] the sun is shining somewhere and saving
[2:30:56] on that star so he sings oh ma
[2:31:00] he said if I can hear one good
[2:31:03] old-fashioned a man
[2:31:05] if I can hear something take place I can
[2:31:08] sing to the top of my voice to know that
[2:31:11] Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday
[2:31:14] today and forever as long as the light
[2:31:17] is movement that's long if we can see a
[2:31:20] star and he said oh I think so let God
[2:31:25] let me sometimes when the the Bills of
[2:31:28] darkness are rolling over
[2:31:29] sometimes when the revival seems like
[2:31:32] all they want is to be formal and
[2:31:33] ungodly and but he said once Allah I can
[2:31:38] hear a good old fashioned amen glory to
[2:31:42] God and I said glory to God the Son it
[2:31:46] sounded somewhere hallelujah what makes
[2:31:50] a real believer shall a man that caught
[2:31:53] a glimpse of the Sun hallelujah and the
[2:31:57] sun is shining on that they can see
[2:32:00] there's a light in the evening time but
[2:32:03] it's not all doctorís but it's a time of
[2:32:05] light I feel like everything I've done
[2:32:10] is background it's time to preach third
[2:32:14] by this time the preachers time to
[2:32:16] declare hey man he said well I can hear
[2:32:19] a good old hearty Amen and once in a
[2:32:23] while hallelujah or somebody jump up and
[2:32:26] scream and cry a little bit i know the
[2:32:29] sun is shining somewhere well he said it
[2:32:32] gives you a real good feeling I'm
[2:32:39] starting to get a real good feeling
[2:32:41] close the light is beginning to shine
[2:32:44] the darkness we're the people who claim
[2:32:50] to be in the interval in the holiest of
[2:32:53] Holies brother Branham says here he said
[2:32:58] I know you think we're an awful noisy
[2:33:01] bunch well brother I can prove to you if
[2:33:05] if there ain't no Z then there ain't no
[2:33:08] God there oh my take that some of you
[2:33:16] morgues out there
[2:33:17] I meant if there's any life and there
[2:33:19] you ought to listen to that I can prove
[2:33:22] to you if it ain't noisy then there
[2:33:24] ain't no God there listen no Testament
[2:33:28] when Aaron anointed with the roses
[2:33:30] Sharon and when he had the northern oil
[2:33:32] that run down his bill of his beard to
[2:33:35] the hymns of His garment he taken that
[2:33:37] sacrifice who wasn't the holiest of
[2:33:39] holies when he went beyond the curtain
[2:33:41] across the garment he had a pomegranate
[2:33:44] and a bale a pomegranate a bell so they
[2:33:47] hip together and when he walked it
[2:33:50] played out holy holy holy unto the Lord
[2:33:53] he said that's the anointed church
[2:33:57] moving into the Holies of Holies and
[2:34:00] lookie here brother the reason they did
[2:34:03] that that's the only way they could tell
[2:34:05] he was alive talking about the breach
[2:34:07] they listened to hear if there was any
[2:34:09] noise and if there was no noise he was
[2:34:12] dead and that's what's today a church
[2:34:16] that's born again going into the Holies
[2:34:19] of Holies anointed with God's
[2:34:21] pomegranate bill yes sir you know I
[2:34:27] don't know what about you but I don't
[2:34:30] want to become a morgue
[2:34:31] with our temperature down 40 below zero
[2:34:34] and cut full of some kind of embalming
[2:34:37] fluid but some kind of of something that
[2:34:40] will keep you dinner than what you
[2:34:41] already are with the joy of the Lord if
[2:34:48] it comes our strength some of them said
[2:34:55] well brother Brennan it's emotional well
[2:35:00] I can scientifically prove to you
[2:35:02] anything without emotion is dead so if
[2:35:06] your religion hasn't got any emotion
[2:35:09] bury the thing that's right because it's
[2:35:13] no good
[2:35:14] it's dead hey man now these are the
[2:35:20] works of Christ that will live in you
[2:35:22] not a sensation but the works of Christ
[2:35:25] he said again greater than Solomon
[2:35:28] there's something about the working of
[2:35:30] the Holy Spirit
[2:35:31] that always stirs up a move it brings
[2:35:35] the emotional part of the people out
[2:35:40] amen
[2:35:41] again said last evening when I seen
[2:35:45] those people coming around from the
[2:35:46] balconies and around weeping standing
[2:35:49] around the altar accepting Christ their
[2:35:51] Savior I'll tell you there's something
[2:35:53] emotional when the Holy Spirit sweeps
[2:35:56] out of over across an audience see their
[2:35:59] face light up with some kind of radiance
[2:36:01] that this world can never produce
[2:36:03] nothing like it to see a little house
[2:36:05] woman with a little checkered dress on
[2:36:08] some bashful she couldn't meet the
[2:36:09] insurance man at the door and stand and
[2:36:11] sing the praises of God it's emotional
[2:36:15] God moves in that and it stirs up an
[2:36:18] interest a man oh he talks about when
[2:36:24] you're born again there's an enthusiasm
[2:36:26] with that birth that sets the soul of
[2:36:29] fire you think that changed well in the
[2:36:32] easter cele said I think we must never
[2:36:35] lose i really azzam amen
[2:36:39] then again again I want to write I want
[2:36:42] to read one more quote to you before we
[2:36:44] try to find a place to stop here but in
[2:36:47] Palma Lucas in caterpillar where brother
[2:36:49] Branham talks about the meeting the bugs
[2:36:51] eating off to the leaves in the bark and
[2:36:54] everything and God promised a
[2:36:56] restoration he says I say this my
[2:36:59] beloved people listen to me I'll spend
[2:37:02] with you some day in the day of judgment
[2:37:04] I have to answer I'll never answer to a
[2:37:07] Creed so help me God I'll answer to the
[2:37:10] Bible that's the book I'll stand by
[2:37:13] there is no place in the Bible is
[2:37:17] everybody everybody hook up with me you
[2:37:20] know listen in real close tidying right
[2:37:23] now there is no place in the Bible where
[2:37:27] they ever receive the Holy Ghost without
[2:37:30] having emotional speaking with tongues
[2:37:35] and shoutings and praises of God and
[2:37:38] prophecies and manifestation they never
[2:37:41] do
[2:37:41] and just walk up and shake hands with
[2:37:44] the preacher and walk away there's no
[2:37:46] place in the Bible like that
[2:37:49] hey mouth you see the Holy Ghost gives
[2:37:53] you an assurance now that we're
[2:37:57] dismissing winds tonight so let me grab
[2:37:59] a little bit of that time there bar and
[2:38:06] winds tonight hey man this is a
[2:38:12] Thanksgiving banquet right here
[2:38:16] hallelujah
[2:38:17] the Holy Ghost he comes with much
[2:38:21] assurance and that proves your election
[2:38:28] let's turn to verse Thessalonians 1 and
[2:38:31] for I want to go through some scriptures
[2:38:32] because brother Branham said there's no
[2:38:34] place in the Bible so there's no place
[2:38:38] in the Bible for any doctrine that says
[2:38:42] you can have the Holy Ghost not know it
[2:38:45] so therefore is without feeling no way
[2:38:48] you could know it there's no place in
[2:38:51] the Bible verse s lunians 1 for knowing
[2:38:55] beloved brethren beloved your election
[2:38:58] of God first of all you can know your
[2:39:02] election how do you know your election
[2:39:04] well I tell you my mom dad told me that
[2:39:07] because I believe the message you know
[2:39:09] that I'm predestinated and I and because
[2:39:13] only predestination can receive this
[2:39:15] knowing brethren beloved your election
[2:39:18] of God first right for our gospel came
[2:39:23] not unto you am the word only
[2:39:26] here's how you know your election it's
[2:39:29] know because we've received the gospel
[2:39:30] there's not just a lecture a word only
[2:39:33] but also in power and in the Holy Ghost
[2:39:39] and then what much assurance
[2:39:45] so the Holy Ghost comes with much
[2:39:48] assurance not something you guess I
[2:39:52] wonder about now if you go to compare
[2:39:56] and your experience with somebody else
[2:39:59] that's not wise God works with you as an
[2:40:02] individual don't compare your experience
[2:40:06] just experience compare your life with
[2:40:09] the Bible does it make you in love with
[2:40:12] Jesus does it make you want to keep his
[2:40:15] word do you want to serve him with all
[2:40:18] your heart
[2:40:19] amen are you leaving sin behind does a
[2:40:22] conviction of convince you of sin does
[2:40:25] it lead you and guide you into all truth
[2:40:27] all right so it doesn't remind you of
[2:40:31] things that he said in other words when
[2:40:33] you look at sin you're reminded what the
[2:40:35] word said all right so this is much
[2:40:38] assurance let's go to - to Acts chapter
[2:40:42] 1 and verse 8 now let's just see no
[2:40:44] place in the Bible and let's just look
[2:40:47] no place in the Bible except that they
[2:40:50] they knew so but you see receive power
[2:40:53] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[2:40:55] you and you shall be witnesses both unto
[2:40:58] me both in Jerusalem to Judea to the
[2:41:02] uttermost part of the earth acts 2 and
[2:41:05] verse 4 and when they were filled with
[2:41:07] the Holy Ghost and began to speak with
[2:41:09] other tongues as the Spirit gave them
[2:41:12] utterance now not only did they know
[2:41:14] that they had taken this new wine but
[2:41:16] everybody else knew right acts 4 and
[2:41:20] verse 31 when they had prayed the place
[2:41:22] was shaken where they were assemble
[2:41:24] together and they were all filled with
[2:41:26] the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word
[2:41:28] of God with boldness so again something
[2:41:31] happened it was an experience let's look
[2:41:34] down there and I accept her 8 verse 14
[2:41:37] this is this is at the house of
[2:41:41] Cornelius when the apostles were at
[2:41:44] Jerusalem heard Denis sameera Samaria
[2:41:46] had received the Word of God they sent
[2:41:48] unto them Peter and John who when they I
[2:41:50] were come down prayed for them that they
[2:41:53] might receive the Holy Ghost for his yet
[2:41:55] he was fallen upon none of them
[2:41:57] they were baptized of the Lord in the
[2:42:00] name of the Lord Jesus then they laid
[2:42:02] their hands on them and they received
[2:42:05] the Holy Ghost now something happens so
[2:42:09] phenomenal that there was this
[2:42:11] soothsayer named Simon in verse 18 when
[2:42:15] he saw that bat through the laying on of
[2:42:17] the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was
[2:42:19] given he gay he offered them money so he
[2:42:24] saw some results he saw something
[2:42:29] happened when the guests were something
[2:42:33] that happened hey man now let's go down
[2:42:36] to Philip in and they the unit acts 8 39
[2:42:41] and when they had come out of the water
[2:42:43] the Spirit the Lord called away Philip
[2:42:46] and the eunuch saw him no no more and he
[2:42:49] went away rejoicing now here he's
[2:42:52] baptizing him in water and manna and the
[2:42:56] Spirit of God picks Phillip up and
[2:42:58] transforms him to another place miles
[2:43:04] away and he's found preaching somewhere
[2:43:06] else but the eunuch sees this
[2:43:11] come on and he went his way rejoicing so
[2:43:17] something happened phenomena was taking
[2:43:22] place supernatural was going on let's go
[2:43:26] to Acts chapter 9 and verse 17 and let's
[2:43:30] just go to 18 - the same time
[2:43:32] immediately this is solved being prayed
[2:43:35] for the Apostle Paul when he was blinded
[2:43:37] by by on the road to Damascus and and
[2:43:41] sent to Ananias and immediately there
[2:43:44] fell from his eyes as it had been scales
[2:43:48] and he received sight forthwith any
[2:43:51] roads and was baptized something
[2:43:53] happened axed him to 44 house of
[2:43:58] Cornelia finally getting to it
[2:44:00] when Peter spoke these words the Holy
[2:44:02] Ghost fell on them which heard the word
[2:44:06] and they are the circumcision which
[2:44:08] believed were astonished as many as
[2:44:11] but Peter because on the Gentiles also
[2:44:14] was poured out the gift of the Holy
[2:44:16] Ghost far they heard them speak with
[2:44:20] tongues and magnify God so the answer
[2:44:24] heard them magnifying God in other
[2:44:27] languages now I don't really care what
[2:44:30] language you speak in it ought to cause
[2:44:34] your life to glorify Jesus Christ that's
[2:44:40] the whole point
[2:44:41] hey man now again Acts 11:15 Peter
[2:44:46] recounts I began to speak unto them the
[2:44:49] Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the
[2:44:52] beginning so he points right back to
[2:44:53] acts 2 what happened there happened here
[2:44:56] hey man so what happened in acts 2 here
[2:44:59] come a sound from heaven like a roar
[2:45:01] rushing mighty wind it filled the house
[2:45:03] where they were sitting
[2:45:04] and Men the cloven tongues of fire come
[2:45:07] down on each one of them and they were
[2:45:09] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[2:45:11] speak in other languages as the spirit
[2:45:13] gave them utterance
[2:45:15] something happened so nobody got it
[2:45:19] without knowing it a man verse 8 God
[2:45:23] would snore the art bear them witness
[2:45:25] giving them the Holy Ghost even as he
[2:45:27] did this and put no difference between
[2:45:29] us and them purifying their hearts by
[2:45:31] faith
[2:45:32] here comes Acts chapter 19 here Paul is
[2:45:36] going down to some disciples of John the
[2:45:39] Baptist and ain't even heard that there
[2:45:42] was such a thing as the Holy Ghost and
[2:45:44] he preached to ask him how were you
[2:45:46] baptized so well we were we were
[2:45:48] baptized under John's baptism and so
[2:45:50] well you got to take on the name of the
[2:45:51] one crucified to be baptized in Christ
[2:45:54] Jesus verse 4 in soceity that's when
[2:45:57] they had heard this that were baptized
[2:45:59] in the name of the Lord Jesus and when
[2:46:01] Paul laid his hands upon them the Holy
[2:46:04] Ghost came on them and they spake with
[2:46:07] tongues and prophesied so yea I won't
[2:46:10] point out to you in in all of these
[2:46:13] occasions it did not say they spoke with
[2:46:16] tongues that's just one of the
[2:46:18] manifestations of the same Holy Ghost
[2:46:21] are you with me but in several of the
[2:46:24] cases they
[2:46:25] speaking other languages and so that
[2:46:28] care that are also something the Holy
[2:46:30] Ghost does but tongues is not the Holy
[2:46:33] Ghost is a gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:46:36] hey ma'am now again so we we come right
[2:46:40] back down
[2:46:41] be sensation brother Brennan said I
[2:46:42] don't care about sensation I will the
[2:46:46] set the Lord I believe in a heartfelt
[2:46:49] religion I believe in the joy that I can
[2:46:53] know I believe in the power of the Holy
[2:46:56] Spirit I believe in divine healing I
[2:46:59] believe in all the manifestations of the
[2:47:02] gifts but they must be reverent and so
[2:47:05] on and then he said don't try to get a
[2:47:07] sensation that I take place of the Holy
[2:47:09] Ghost see the other extreme neither do
[2:47:12] you just come with a cold intellectual
[2:47:14] conception of Christ and never open up
[2:47:16] your heart to him there again you know
[2:47:19] this this is this is where we are two
[2:47:22] sides that people are falling off they
[2:47:26] think well I spoke in tongues hey ain't
[2:47:28] I got it and they'll it don't don't have
[2:47:30] a change life you got on the other side
[2:47:32] well I believe the message I believe in
[2:47:34] Christ is my Savior and don't have a
[2:47:36] change life we want a changed life the
[2:47:42] middle of the road
[2:47:43] amen now in that middle of the road
[2:47:46] there's joy there's shouting there's the
[2:47:48] Holy Ghost there's the power of God and
[2:47:50] the salvation and listen it is not a
[2:47:54] sensation but it is an experience it's a
[2:47:59] happening something happens it's not an
[2:48:03] imagination not something that happens
[2:48:07] in your mind it's something happens
[2:48:11] Christ comes and he changes you till he
[2:48:16] does it's better felt and held because
[2:48:20] you can't tell how it feels
[2:48:23] hey man you know what has happened to
[2:48:26] you and you know your life has changed
[2:48:28] amen now you shall know John 14 20 year
[2:48:33] she'll know that I'm in my father and me
[2:48:37] and you and you in me
[2:48:38] and first John two and three hereby we
[2:48:41] do know that we know him see so you can
[2:48:45] know a man this is this again he speaks
[2:48:49] about it him first John 2:28 he said
[2:48:53] little children abide in him it's not a
[2:48:56] comin in a going it's not a leaving him
[2:48:58] his stayin its abiding in him and when
[2:49:01] he comes he abides with you forever Amen
[2:49:04] he'll never leave you or forsake you in
[2:49:06] for him first John three and one beloved
[2:49:09] what manner of love the father hath
[2:49:11] bestowed upon us that we should be
[2:49:13] called the sons of God therefore the
[2:49:15] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[2:49:17] not beloved now we are the sons of God
[2:49:19] yet it doesn't appear what we shall be
[2:49:21] but we know that listen we know that
[2:49:25] when he shall appear we shall be like
[2:49:26] him for we shall see him as he is and
[2:49:28] every one that has this hope purifies
[2:49:31] himself even as he's pure and verse John
[2:49:36] 3:14 we know we have passed from death
[2:49:40] unto life Wow because we love the
[2:49:43] Brethren he that loveth not his brother
[2:49:45] abideth and death verse 18 said my
[2:49:49] little children let us not love in Word
[2:49:50] neither tongue but in deed and truth and
[2:49:52] hereby we know we are of the truth and
[2:49:55] shall assure our hearts before Eden so
[2:49:58] you know how do we love our brothers do
[2:50:01] we do it by hugs and warm embraces our
[2:50:04] popular you know proper affection is
[2:50:07] always needed and how do we love one
[2:50:10] another we love one another by walking
[2:50:13] with God by producing an example for
[2:50:16] others to follow by mentoring some of
[2:50:20] these fatherless boys fatherless girls
[2:50:23] by not casting a stumbling block and
[2:50:26] some others other persons way well I
[2:50:28] could live I could do that yeah but are
[2:50:30] you casting a stumbling block hey man by
[2:50:36] giving a helping hand by encouraging our
[2:50:39] youth in our elderly for the and those
[2:50:42] that are weak in faith that's how we see
[2:50:44] express love for the Brethren all of
[2:50:47] this is a part of a Christian walk is
[2:50:50] not one thing
[2:50:57] but we want one thing so we say we got
[2:51:00] it and now that we got it then we can
[2:51:03] just get back in ease enzyme it is a
[2:51:07] walk with God and as you walk with God
[2:51:12] you call from both sides and you're
[2:51:14] neither fanatic neither are you just
[2:51:19] intellectual but you're walking down the
[2:51:22] middle of the road you get in the Word
[2:51:24] of God you hear what it says and then
[2:51:27] you apply it correctly and scripturally
[2:51:30] and then you love your brother enough to
[2:51:33] let God do that with him the way he did
[2:51:36] it with you in God's time do you love
[2:51:45] him this morning let's walk down the
[2:51:49] Kings Highway let's stand together
[2:51:56] walking down the Kings Highway my load
[2:52:00] is brighter my load is lighter rather my
[2:52:03] route mine my way it gets brighter
[2:52:05] walking up the Kings Highway there's joy
[2:52:09] and knowing with him I'm going
[2:52:11] amen a sleigh aside ever weight ever sin
[2:52:15] all unbelief don't walk either side
[2:52:20] don't let yourself getting over here
[2:52:22] fanatical legalistic only on one side
[2:52:27] judgmental of everybody I don't do you
[2:52:30] know I tell you but God do something why
[2:52:35] don't you just be a Christian and let
[2:52:37] God be gone if when you see something
[2:52:44] you don't quite agree with maybe I
[2:52:47] wouldn't agree then take it before the
[2:52:49] Lord in prayer say Lord we want a mature
[2:52:53] church help us for these things Lord
[2:52:56] give us wisdom in these things give us
[2:52:59] knowledge love him with all your
[2:53:03] there's gonna be a rapture don't have
[2:53:07] it's gonna happen in spite of ourselves
[2:53:11] his word declares it thing about it is
[2:53:15] you want to be ready you want that
[2:53:19] maturity in your life they will use this
[2:53:23] powerheads just for a moment yeah I know
[2:53:26] I know sometimes things gets a little
[2:53:30] lengthy but we have to have some time
[2:53:33] some time just to lay some of these
[2:53:34] things out and I've had these for months
[2:53:38] trying to get to these places studying
[2:53:43] preparing crying out to God Lord let me
[2:53:47] deliver it in the right way
[2:53:50] give the people here and here Lord I
[2:53:54] know you want to church this without
[2:53:56] spot or wrinkle maybe you have been a
[2:53:59] little dilatory maybe you've been one
[2:54:02] side too much sore one side this other
[2:54:05] way you don't have a balanced Christian
[2:54:08] walk and you would say Lord today I
[2:54:16] don't want to walk the edges no more I
[2:54:20] found out that's the danger zone in so
[2:54:23] many of shipwreck look at the crosses
[2:54:27] and the names along the way the
[2:54:29] memorials to those who fell off in to
[2:54:33] oblivion some thought oh they could
[2:54:36] abandon holiness they didn't have to
[2:54:39] listen what the prophets said they they
[2:54:41] they got their own views I wonder if you
[2:54:44] got the view it came from the Spirit of
[2:54:50] God the angel of God what about you what
[2:54:53] about is there balance in your life what
[2:54:56] about the extreme the parent and the
[2:55:01] husband wife relationship and as I said
[2:55:04] the parent let your children act
[2:55:07] different ways and don't treat them and
[2:55:10] and tutor them he said well I you know I
[2:55:13] don't want to inhibit their little
[2:55:15] spirit
[2:55:16] oh you better you better bring it in
[2:55:19] check because a child that goes
[2:55:22] unchecked ones up in in jail in prison
[2:55:24] and in all kinds of extremism when you
[2:55:27] see your children misbehaving you seem
[2:55:32] that misbehaving in church and distress
[2:55:34] tracked and in church have enough Holy
[2:55:36] Ghost about you to bring your children
[2:55:40] in order and worship them how to worship
[2:55:43] right be mature people in all things
[2:55:52] honor him I just wear it wherever the
[2:55:59] Holy Spirit just directs the word to
[2:56:02] your heart
[2:56:03] maybe sure remember your attitude toward
[2:56:08] Christ he's shown in what you do and
[2:56:11] it's gonna have a real effect on your
[2:56:13] children that has to do with church
[2:56:17] attendance tithe paying air air any any
[2:56:20] party it's an attitude toward Christ and
[2:56:23] that's gonna have an effect on your
[2:56:25] children don't you want to have a family
[2:56:30] that's ready to meet God don't you want
[2:56:34] to be in love with Jesus you know I'm
[2:56:39] not just sometimes he preached and
[2:56:42] you're very very little seem very very
[2:56:44] hard and legalistic I'm not that way I
[2:56:47] know grace is what takes the favor of
[2:56:50] God but let's don't take it over either
[2:56:53] to extreme and to some kind of greezy
[2:56:57] grace where that sin is accepted and we
[2:57:03] just think the favor of God will cover
[2:57:04] it up once you let your life change in
[2:57:08] his presence would there be someone here
[2:57:11] today they just want to move toward God
[2:57:13] just where you're out in your seat not
[2:57:16] asking you to come down for prayer
[2:57:19] there's a time for that
[2:57:24] and even even there you know you
[2:57:27] shouldn't come down here to the altar
[2:57:29] every time for prayer some people do it
[2:57:31] officially over and over again you can't
[2:57:33] can't cast the net without somebody
[2:57:35] getting in it
[2:57:36] don't do that find some balance learn
[2:57:40] how to pray yourself be grown-up sure I
[2:57:48] don't want to inhibit you from coming
[2:57:51] from father's time you need to come from
[2:57:53] prayer right there where you are be a
[2:57:57] real Christian surrender that life to
[2:58:02] Christ put a nine get an anchor down in

[2:59:51] to get you back in the middle of the
[2:59:52] road what about you and your walk with
[2:59:58] Jesus is the word supposed to be
[3:00:06] if it were it's supposed to be maybe
[3:00:12] maybe you're on the highway but you walk
[3:00:16] too close to one edge of the other
[3:00:20] causes you to have feelings toward
[3:00:23] others this fellowship and causes you to
[3:00:29] not respond properly to the Word of God
[3:00:34] that warm sweetness and the Holy Ghost
[3:00:37] is not yours this is the cold just a
[3:00:42] cold something far away in God's so far

[3:16:55] allelujah a man we bring in a wandering
[3:17:00] soul that has been out of the promised
[3:17:02] land
[3:17:03] he's been there in exile for many many
[3:17:07] many years but today he's coming home
[3:17:11] amen never to Rome again amen but we'll
[3:17:16] know more Rome after he takes us under
[3:17:18] his wings and I believe that illegal
[3:17:22] spread out his wings found another one
[3:17:25] of his sons out there who's been lost in
[3:17:28] darkness we can read in the scripture
[3:17:31] all through the Bible Jesus would tell
[3:17:35] us to go into all the world and preach
[3:17:37] the gospel and baptize them it would
[3:17:40] tell him to Bab - tell us - baptized in
[3:17:42] his name the name of the Father and of
[3:17:47] the Son and of the Holy Ghost all
[3:17:49] through the Bible we've read numerous
[3:17:52] occasions today where the disciples in
[3:17:55] acted this baptism in obedience to the
[3:17:59] word of Jesus were by that they would
[3:18:02] actually immerse them in the name of the
[3:18:07] Lord Jesus Christ this is all - the
[3:18:10] Bible this is why we baptize this way we
[3:18:15] believe that he that believeth and is
[3:18:17] baptized shall be saved he that
[3:18:20] believeth not shall be damned we believe
[3:18:24] that baptism does now also save us not
[3:18:27] in the putting away of the filth of the
[3:18:29] flesh but to answer a good conscience
[3:18:31] toward God that we've obeyed him fully
[3:18:35] and we're going to walk with Him today I
[3:18:38] have here from the EJ Parker that is
[3:18:43] repented of his sins his wants to walk
[3:18:47] with the Lord and he's coming as a
[3:18:50] repentant sinner and the old man is dead
[3:18:54] the old man caused him a lot of sorrow
