thankful to be serving a living God Lord with living realities signs and wonders to be performed even Among Us Lord we see Lord you Healing The Sick and touching Hearts saving the Lost What a Mighty God you are even in this time of great Darkness Lord there's such a great light that is shining Lord I ask God you open our eyes that we can see Lord there's more for us than there is against us we love you with all of our hearts we thank you for this opportunity we praise you and thank you in jesus' name amen amen turn our Bibles to 2 Corinthians amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen said it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen Allelujah Amen to have a place to worship him and to give him honor let's do his name 2 Corinthians 3 and verse1 17 says now the Lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty or emancipation from bondage or true freedom and we all with unveiled face continually seeing as in a mirror the glory of the Lord or progressively being transformed into his image from one degree of Glory to even more Glory which comes from the Lord who is the spirit amen we let you be seated i' like to speak to you tonight again on the light amen it's been a moment since I spoke on that but actually I've had this for quite some time but just other things come in and you just feel to go a different away for a little bit but like to speak to you on the light the Liberty in our purpose or the Liberty in our purpose uh uh just I read this out of the amplifi just to kind of give a more in depth thought here of the Liberty that is afforded to us it's a emancipation from bondage it's a true Freedom amen and I and but we have a purpose and that purpose is we're being transformed amen into the image of his son from one deg degree of Glory to even more Glory from Glory unto Glory he's changing us amen you know brother brandom talks about the Emancipation Proclamation uh when the slaves were he said our C colored Breen and sisters in the South when they used to have slavery he said when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed here they'd been whipped and beat and so forth and been slaves and they said at a certain morning he I don't remember the date but that morning you're going to be free and you're free at Sun up and when the Sun rises all the slaves could go free this poor decrepit heartbeat slaves no doubt were very anxious to be free amen that to you know because it wasn't their purpose their purpose in life was not to be a slave amen but their purpose was to be a a man or a woman of Freedom Amen to live life as they would see fit but here they found them themselves in slavery he said and so their their their hearts were beating towards freedom and and said they had was so anxious to maybe one of the strongest one of them climbed up to the top of the hill to get that first glimpse of the Dawn as it would come over the horizon ones quite not so strong would climb down a little further and the women the children on down and those great big strong men were able to go up to the top and stood there before Daybreak and they looked and they looked and after the they begin to see the streaks of that sun rising and they begin to re relay it down into the valley one holler from the top we're free and the next one holler down we're free all the way down in the valley we're free why the Sun is up and they let off the pressure and screamed and shouted to the top of their voices because they were free the Sun is up that was the Su n he said but old brother now the S so n is up we're free Hallelujah the signs of his resurrection is Right Among Us Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's not dead but he's alive forever more the Sun is up and I I was thinking on that for a moment and reading this in the back back there and how they brother brandom depicts it as they begin to scream and shout at the top of their voices because they were free the sun was up and he said again that was the Su in so how much more us seeing the so n is risen among us should there be a shout in our hearts and our lives and and a victory amen because that's not our our purpose was not to be people of slavery our our purpose was not to serve sin as a slave but our purpose was to be in the image of almighty God but we know as it were we were sold into slavery and and we were bound and born in sin and shaping iniquity but in this day amen the power of God has been given once again to break the shackles of sin off of our lives and we can scream out as those slaves did aund or so years ago the S so n is up we were once slaves to sin we were once slaves to church denominations or church anties and all these things but today we are free amen we are free the Son of God has ra ra risen with healing in his wings the son is up amen the light changed everything for them that morning amen it brought the dawn of freedom because their purpose in life was not to be a slave amen their purpose in life was not to be beat by a whip or to be bound by change or or to be bound and and serve a certain man but their purpose was to be born free and I I believe that in the Church of the Living God our purpose was not to be slaves of sin our purpose was not to be slaves to churchianity or or church ideas or church Creeds amen but we can declare with the same shout amen man that the S so n is up the sun is risen in our midst and that's why we have rejoicing in our hearts that's that's why we have freedom in our lives amen because we see amen the Son of God Is Risen Among Us and he's risen with healing in his wings he's risen with healing to heal cancer and diseases of every kind he's risen with healings to heal scars from past mistakes and past failures and lives that have been bowed amen he's he's r isn't with enough healing in his wings Amen to set you free from the past that you once lived and the past mistakes that you once carried and the past sins that you once done he has risen with healing and his wings that's why there's something in our hearts amen crying out to a god like that amen if you haven't found you a god like that I I encourage you to find find you somebody amen a God who can heal and a God who can deliver a God who can set free a god God that can break the chains of sin a God that can heal any disease amen a God that can set you free amen from your church anity and your church Creeds and your church ideas find you a god like that then you'll find you somebody worth worshiping you'll find you someone worth praising you'll find you somebody that it'll break you out of the mold of humanity and get into the Realms of the Holy Ghost to lift your hands to lift your voice to shout and give God praise praise if you find a god like that you'll find a god worth praising amen you know just as the children of Israel amen their purpose was not to be slaves they were sold down into slavery into Egypt you know Moses was raised up for a purpose but he it was not a purpose of being a shepherd on the backside of the desert somewhere but he was born for a purpose of freeing God's people amen amen Moses standing up there on that mount and he sees his Burning Bush you know he had come to the place he had lost all hopes of Freedom amen he had lost all hopes of Freedom it didn't seem like that the freedom that the people he so gallantly stood for one time that it was ever going to happen but in the light of God standing in that burning bush everything in him changed amen the light brought the change and Moses to bring the Deliverance to the children of Israel Amen to bring the Liberty he said I think it's the same thing today many of us lose the sight of Freedom come on somebody we lose the sight of Freedom he said I think about it here he said here's a little boy sitting before me probably maybe infantile paralysis little arms twisted up he said I see a lady with a white cane in front maybe a blind woman there's a lovely young lady over here on a little cart maybe many of you here with cancer and heart trouble and diseases that's going to kill you but you lose all thought of Freedom as soon as the doctor says it's incurable you think you'll never be free from it but there is a Healer in our midst amen there's a chain breaker in our midst there's somebody can heal any disease that can cure any sin trouble that can set the violence of Sinners free amen there is someone here that's in our midst that can remove all the shackles of life that can break all the sin barriers that can break all the things that has held you and maybe you've been held by generational curses but I can tell you there's somebody here that can deliver you from those things Hallelujah he said why brother if we could ever come in the presence of God like Moses did he said it revolutionized him yes sir amen that's what we need amen we need to be so changed to where we lose our human amen human ability to think listen it wasn't human thinking that got Moses and his donkey and his wife and his rod and started going down to Egypt to take over that wasn't human thinking human thinking would have pushed him back to you're crazy get back in your tent but it was the angel of God that met him in a burning bush and it changed his thinking it changed his thoughts even about himself and about the the people of God and about what he was going to do it was the light that put a purpose in him and it was a light that drove him to that purpose of Liberty Hallelujah I pray that same light will come tonight and it'll show you it'll change your thinking Hallelujah I ain't somebody that's supposed to be bound by depression I'm not somebody that's supposed to be bound by pornography I'm not somebody that's that's not who I am I met a l and that light has told me you're not here for this purpose but you're here for The Spar son or daughter of God he said I think of a man or woman could ever step into the light of the Holy Spirit my he said the light of that angel of God standing on that mountain that day everything that he once ever thought never would happen it came to reality cuz he stepped into that light Hallelujah you said well I'll never be free from this brother Timothy step into the light amen he said I think if men or women today could ever step into the light of the Holy Spirit under the unction of God's spirit and the light of God's word everything that God has promised will illuminate to you and be real again maybe you've let the old Promises of God die off for a little while and they're not real but if you'll let the light of God come and illuminated again it will become real to you again amen it'll become real that he's still the Healer it'll become real that he's still the Savior it'll become real that he's still the satisfier it'll become real that he's still a drink that you can take and you'll never thirst again it'll become real that he's the same yesterday today and forever if you let that light illuminate you it'll become reality again he said that's the reason Moses failed in the first place here was what the matter it was it was a lack of having what the burning bush had Hallelujah that's our failure today is a lack of having what the Holy Spirit has the Holy Spirit has all good things for us and if we receive the Holy Spirit then all things are possible and not only possible but promised to us Jesus said ask the father anything in my name and I will do it if you abide in me and my words abide in you see what he does he Ties That scripture straight to the Holy Ghost if you abide in me and my words abide in me ask what you will and it will be given to you when we step on the light of God's word with the unction of the Holy Spirit to shine the light on it brother The Impossible becomes little things then come on now the impossible becomes little things then I you just put it in our own thoughts it might seem to be impossible to climb Mount Everest but if you get in the right vehicle it becomes little things amen I I I told this before I was in South Africa one time and and walking down these streets with these big skyscrapers and looking up these big buildings few moments later I was up in a restaurant looking down on the SK skyscrapers thought wow this is incredible the next day I was in table on Table Rock looking down on the on the restaurant upon the skyscrapers few days later I was in an airplane flying over Table Rock come on now amen this is the vehicle that we're talking about is the Holy Ghost it's the light some things you're looking at tonight looks impossible but if you'll get into him you'll rise above it amen it might look like it's impossible unobtainable unre no reality to it but if you get in the Holy Ghost and the light shines on it it'll become a reality and a little thing then that's right Hallelujah if you're sick tonight and you get into the spirit of God and you read he's the Lord God that heals all our diseases then that sickness becomes a defeated thing a little [Applause] thing amen it's in the Liberty it's in the liberty of our purpose amen your purpose was not to be filled with cancer that wasn't your purpose your purpose was to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen your purpose is not to be a disease carrier or a carrier of any kind sin that was not who we were that's not why we were put here for that's not why we were created for I was not created for Satan and his demons I was not created for any of his nonsense I was not created for any sickness he invented from hence forth and forever more I was not created for any of it I was created for the power of the Living God to live on the inside of me and the light of God to shine out of my life that's what I was created for that is what you were created for he was not created for that depression you was not created for that anxiety you was not created for that fear amen you was not created for any kind of sin that's holding you tonight you were created a temple for the holy ghost that is what you're here for Hallelujah some of you need to tell the devil get off of me I'm not for you this is not this house is not your house this place is not yours I was created for one purpose alone and that's to live in the freedom that has been afforded to me by God who died on Calvary and his blood was shed for me and it broke your rights to live inside of [Applause] here God ask us to believe his word therefore he sends the Holy Spirit to energize that word when he falls into it h I'm almost in another realm already Mercy when he sends the Holy Spirit to energize the word when he falls into it when the word's being preached and the Holy Spirit brings the word he energizes that and he flashes the same light of God's blessed promise God said I have remembered my promise to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I'm sending you down there to do it when God's word and promise becomes enlightened by the presence of the Angel of the Lord stop Moses now if you can Hallelujah I have remembered my promise of I'm the Lord God that heals all thy diseases and I'm sending you down there to do it I remembered my promise that I am the same yesterday today and forever and I'm sending you down there to do it I have remembered my promise that you will overcome him just as I overcame him and I have sent you down there to do it this is why you're here amen not to be overcome but to be to overcome Satan's aeden we're not here to be run over we're here to run over we're not here to be defeated we're here to defeat we're here to rise above the sin and the things that are so easily and so easily beset us and press toward the mark we're here to defeat cancer we're here to defeat any disease I just say any disease soever devil will get notice we're here to defeat you we're here to defeat every sin how wonderful it is to step into the light of his presence it's not a myth neither something that somebody just fleshly in their own minds draw up no it's coming directly into the presence of the king of glory the Eternal Light of the Living God when something happens that anchors that hope in you that no matter how sick you get afterwards it absolutely is no good for the devil to tempt you anything contrary cuz now it's anchored that's right Hallelujah the devil he ain't going to quit Whispering he ain't going to quit coming he ain't going to quit saying you're la he's not going to quit saying you're sick he's not going to quit bringing up fleshly manifestation he's not going to quit he's he he's he's a good adversary honestly the dude the dude knows he's going to lose and he won't quit some of you know you're going to win and you quit that was good right there amen you know it's been written about you your purpose is a winner right and you quit but the devil knows he's going to lose and he keeps coming and he keeps coming and he keeps talking and he keeps saying and he keeps producing these these manifestations and these symptoms and all this stuff but that don't mean nothing God's word still the same and it's been illuminated to me that it's over with hallelujah oh my God I tell you what Sister Sister Jeanie is here again with us tonight she's got another result her cancer numbers again cut in half she said she said she said when you refer to that devil Don't Call Him cancer call him defeated cancer is the name the doctor gave to it but the name God gives to it is defeated Hallelujah a psychist might give you some name this FL but God gives it a name it's already done it's defeated it's over with it's finished amen we don't even want to lift it up to where a doctor gives it his own n no let's tell it what it is it's defeated amen Ron Spencer's life is the same thing defeated and my life defeated whatever devil has been tormenting me tormenting you we need to look at it and just call him what he is defeated when he talks to you say what are you talking about you defeated scum bum you're defeated you're done it's over with amen the blood is still alive and real the blood still has just as much power today to save me as it save somebody else it's got just as much power to save somebody else as it saved me it's got just as much power today to heal Genie Camp as it did Atlanta bu he got just as much power today to heal Ron Spencer amen that is not their purpose their purpose is a son and daughter of the [Applause] king he says that's the way no matter how much the devil tempt you to do anything contrary is anchored no matter how much the enemy would cause you to try to live the wrong life you're anchored forever when you stepped into his presence into a Divine Light that let me read this real slow that changed your innermost being and put a joy and Bell of Salvation ringing in your heart that the world knows nothing about but you pass from death into life death and his Shadows have left you and you become a new creature when you stepped into this Divine Light the light told you of your purpose what you was really here for Darkness was trying to tell you that's who you was and that's who you're going to be and you're just going to die and you're going to take your own life or whatever Darkness tries to say but light begins to pulsate Amen in Matthew 4:16 it said the people which set in darkness saw a great light and to them which set in region in the shadow of death light is sprung R up amen just because you're in darkness does not mean there's not light somewhere and light is shining out in the dark we live we live in the in the darkest time there's ever been we've been on this you go back talking about light and and the reason why it's so dark is because light is pushing against it sure darkness is congealing and trying to trying to bring his forces together to stop the light but light always overcomes of death there's death the the world has a smell of death on it each time we hear an ulous scream or we pass a cemetery or look at the news nowadays or hospital or every gray hair it marks in our memories that we are a doomed people as far as the people of this Earth the both young and old would come on today we come to a service like this to gather hopes amen and and and what we're here for and what is the purpose of being here he said I think that this is a wonderful time to think on the hopes that God has given us the darkness that we're living in it's a wonderful time to stop for a minute and think about the hope God has given us now we want to draw this first in our mind this is the first thing in our mind that there is not one thing that can destroy us unto the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled Hallelujah there could be nothing we are made for a purpose this church was built here for a purpose amen it was orchestrated by God the foundations was not just dug in the Cornerstone laid the books laid in the building and the roof and the interior but it was not put here to just see if it could be done no but God orchestrated things put it on hearts and be to move and we're now we're now come to worship every service in a miracle I mean if we ought to we ought to be a people any person we ought to be people who believe in miracles cuz we're looking at Miracles looking all around us is it was laid there for a purpose everything was built for a purpose it was put there amen your home that you live in you you didn't just buy it to see if that was something you wanted or liked or or you thought man maybe maybe somebody built it just to see if it could be built no it was made for a purpose to serve a purpose to be a home Amen to to have a place that you could get away from the world and the things of the world and have an atmosphere you could go home to in the evenings or from your school amen it was made there for a purpose you know you drove here in an automobile that automobile was not put together just to see if somebody could put it together this Earth that we live on and the solar system was not just so God could see if he could build something he didn't build mountains just to see if he could build a mountain range he didn't he didn't dig out of ocean just to see if he could put it there no everything has a purpose he he didn't create the most annoying bug for no reason it has a purpose may not be for my purpose but it has a purpose amen the clothing everything it was not to just see if somebody could make something and fashion it and see no it was for a purpose the food you eat it was not grown on Earth just to see if it could grow it was made for a purpose God did not just make a tree for it to be a tree to see if he could make a tree no he made a tree that it would serve a purpose so if a house a home a car this church a tree a bug has a purpose God did not make you an I just to see if he can make you an eye he made you for a purpose amen there is a purpose of all of us being here you're not here just because you're here or just because you thought it was a good idea to come no God brought you here and he brought you here for a purpose to serve a purpose I hope this is all right but in the prayer line it was told Brother D amen you didn't come here because you needed us you came here because we needed you amen that's thus sayith the Lord Hey listen we're you're not all here because you needed us you're here because us this church needed you yes amen we could not be a whole body without all the body being here everything on our body serves a purpose they've tried to figure out maybe they figured it out by now just ain't heard about it but you have what is that the spleen or something that is it the spleen they don't know some somewhere huh appendix that's what I'm looking for the appendix they maybe not understand but it was put there for a purpose your gallbladder is there for a purpose your liver there for a purpose your stomach's there for a purpose everything serves a purpose your thumb's here for a purpose yes it's needed it's part of the body amen and when you'll realize I'm part of the body and no matter where God put me in the body I have a purpose and then when you realize you have a purpose then you'll realize there's freedom in your purpose there's here there's Deliverance right there when you find out God put me here for a reason that's right I might not be the speaker I might not be the musicians I might not be the Deacon I not might not be the song leader I might not be the body parts that are seen online or offline I may not be that but I might be something so integral if I ain't here this body will [Applause] die amen my fingers here is for a purpose your nail on your fingers for a purpose your eye every part is for your body to serve a purpose if it was not put there just see what would look like it was not there the skin on the bottom of your feet for a purpose try walking with some skin missing it hurts it's important it might be the lowest of the lowest and some of the nastiest smelling stuff can stink sometimes so bad but it has a purpose I'm not going to try to apply that to us but I'm just going to say what it is if you are just the skin that's all you can find of yourself is the lowest of the lowest of the low I'm Just a Nobody we need you and if you find out that that is your purpose God put you here for you'll realize that when that body of Christ that foot goes down every Devil's under you sir so if you are the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom you're every devil is still under you when the weakest of Christians goes upon their knees all of Hell trembles amen why because it's a part of the great body of Christ and it's serving his purpose and when you realize what your purpose is you will find your [Applause] Liberty people get so bound up because they want something different but God's ordained them to be this and that's why they're bound up amen if they realize what their purpose is and why they're here he said if we if we were put here for a purpose then nothing can destroy us until God's purpose was fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose is fulfilled that God has put us here for and has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches how many Sorrows we go through all of these are for reasons and there's a reason for it hello somebody there's a reason for you going through the issues that you're going through there's a situation that is happening and why I don't know if I have time to it but there's a reason we were made to be Eagles I'll just jump over in there for a moment and brother BR talks about it and the eagle stirring his neet he said an eagle was not born just for a nest where it's all fluffy and it's all nice and neat and it's all no but sooner or later Mama Eagle comes by and starts pulling that feather them feathers out and that lamb skin out or that rabbit skin out and the next thing you know there's stickers everywhere why because he knows she knows that your duty or your purpose is not to just sit in a nest somewhere but to fly into the heavenlies so he allows things to come by our way Amen to test us to try us why because he wants you to start putting confidence in the two Wings God's giv you you see brother so and so flying and you see sister so so flying but God wants you to know you can fly too he wants you to know you wasn't born as a Earthbound creature but you were born for the heavenlies so everything has a purpose and everything will serve its purpose everything has a reason for it as we've read before every for every season and time things serve their purpose there's a time to die a time to all you know the scripture everything has it we take for an instance Noah in the Bible it was a flood that came on the Earth was destroyed vegetation everything was destroyed but Noah and the seed had taken the ark why because God's purpose can never be defeated Hallelujah his seed will go on right there's nothing that can defeat it so happy we how happy ought we to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there's neither things present nor things to come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils no nothing can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God is imagining his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon that's there is no power there is nothing that can ever separate God's Great and Mortal Eternal plan it must be as God has declared then we find that in the days of all the world was going to be destroyed God made a preparation if his if his purpose was not going to be defeated then he had to make a way for it not to be that's right so he makes a preparation to conserve his purpose to conserve a church to conserve a people he will conserve subjects for his great domain the death that death cannot destroy and we realize that this is by faith that we believe this but the resurrection produces a solid foundation on which our faith rest nothing can destroy as a poet wrote Oh What A foraste of Glory Divine heir of Salvation purchased of God born of his Spirit washed and blood what an assurance upon this Solid Rock the resurrection of our Lord's blessed lover the Lord Jesus nothing can destroy it it has been planted it is a seed of God it is a purpose of God to give us the Blessed Holy Spirit Hallelujah so why why do we need it why do we got to have it cuz it's our vehicle out of here just as Noah had the ark we have to have the Holy Ghost amen it is our vehicle out of here and God has a purpose for it because he has a table that's been prepared Hallelujah and he's got seats there and he's got plates there and he he's got them exactly how many is going to be there so he's determined in his mind this one's going to be here this one's going to be here that one's going to be here and there ain't nothing the devil can do about it Allelujah he can how he can blow he can do whatever he wants to do but he cannot put out the purpose of God we have God's Eternal purpose oh there may be teachers there may be isms rise and may be great programs rise there may be things that look like that it but it'll be destroyed but it can that it would be destroyed but it can never be destroyed it's the purpose of God to see that it prevails I'm talking about you it's what he's talking about you're the purpose of God and he will see that you will prevail then it's not up to me and it's not up to you whether it's be destroyed or not it's up to God we can rest assure on it that God will never let his Heritage be destroyed oh how many's part of the family of God for it's his purpose to give it to us now we would think also today upon destruction and trying to destroy God has we have Christ on promise we think of the Hebrew children when God had purposed for them that they were down in Babylon the furnace was he heated up seven times hotter to destroy the purpose of God and Satan was trying to destroy and it was heated up but little did Shadrach mhach and Abed too no they were coming that they were coming out of that furnace but they said our God is able to deliver us but nevertheless we will not bow to that image God had somebody who would serve him and his purpose would not be defeated fire cannot defeat the purpose of God Hallelujah that ought to give us great confidence because this world's about to be born burn burned with fire and born again with fire it's about to be burned but the purpose of God will not be burned amen therefore we can have Liberty in that he said all the hydrogen bomb nuclear bombs the world can never def defeat the resurrection of his church that's right right all the explaining away all the mathematics and so forth all this intelligence the world is disguised through her purpose to do something about to destroy the faith of God's children it'll never do it the faith will live on forever Hallelujah it was the purpose of God to show that he had power over the wild beasts of the field and that's when Daniel went into the lion's den and he said oh King I'll see you in the morning that's right and the King come to look and to see and and here Daniel is still alive and he said not one of them has touched me he said but the angel of God has watched over me what was it God watching over his purpose watching over his seed that they would not perish Hallelujah you know how that coincides with the day with the faith the Living Faith of the Living God in his church there's something in our hearts that speaks that there is a land beyond the river Hallelujah I cannot put my finger on that land and neither can any man but there's something within us that tells us the grave is not our goal Hallelujah dust Thou Art to dust returnest was not spoken of the Soul Hallelujah it wasn't spoken of the Soul it was spoken of this body but there's going to be a few people people that's alive and remain it's not going to go back down into dust but this dust this dirt is going to be changed cuz God is going to save his purpose there's something within us a fire that's burning a light that's been lit by God and there ain't a breeze from hell that can blow it out man maybe I need to read that one more time again there's something within us a fire that's burning a light that's been LT by God I'm here to tell the world this light that's at Eden like Tabernacle was not lit by man this is not man's doing this is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes you can call it man-made all you want to call it man-made but it's not man-made it's not man decreed it's not man driven it's driven by the spirit of the Living God and excuse us us if we realize we're free excuse us if we realize that the chains of sin has been broken off our lives and denominational barriers have been busted wide open and we can be free who the son is set free he's free indeed that's right there's no cold spells in the church there's no indifference among the people no persecution of the world that can blow out of flame that God has lit right oh Big Bad Wolf well I'm telling you my house ain't built out of straw and my my house ain't built out of out of wood it's not something that can be burned CU we know what's going be burned will'll be burned but my house is built out of Eternal things amen you can blow all you want to blow you can howl all you want to howl you can scream all you want to scream you can say what you want it the only thing that'll happen the more you blow is the brighter it's going to get come on somebody I ought to put some rejoicing maybe you feel like your house is about to blow down your flames is going like that and it's be but listen it is going to only build it brighter it's only going to become greater because when those things you go through what does it do it ought I know what it does to a real child of God when you go through trials you go through issues in your life it makes you dig deeper it makes you look into the word and find the things of God and look for every promise and grab a hold of everything what is it doing it's only causing the flame to get brighter dumb devil if he knew what it would really do to a child of God sure the fake ones it's going to put them out and they're going to go out but those that are really built on the Eternal Flame of Almighty God he can blow he can how he can blow he can blow he can send sickness he can send disease he can send turmoil he can send torment he can do whatever he want to it's just going to get greater and greater and greater and greater devil you'll never blow out this eternal [Applause] flame the Daniel not knowing what God was going to do not knowing whether God was going to do but knowing he was able to do it knowing there was something down inside of him told him so God had a purpose and he worked and he had everything working to that purpose and today no matter how indifferent we seem to be at times how strange things go how the church gets in this condition that condition and all the Divine Purpose of God is to it's all Divine Purpose of God to mold us and to make us in his own way or In His Image who knows how to Fashion the material more than the Creator oh there's been great no doubt men great Michelangelo different ones that could sculpt make images but there's nobody like this God who can make an image and he knows how to mold you and he knows know how to fix you he knows how to how to fix the fix the broken places as we talked about the other day he takes it and he fills those cracks in with deity and gold and he moves and he's molding he's making why he's got you in a in his mind a certain image he wants you to be we won't all be the same kind the same person sure we're going to be in the image of God but God has many manifestations so we're not going to all be little Timothy or little little erands or or big errands little Tims we're not going to be that we're all going to be different but we're all going to be him God working the Masterpiece one right after another we all go through different things in life we're all broken in different places we all go through different trials we don't all face cancer we don't all face this disease or that disease we didn't all smoke we didn't all do this we didn't all do that that's right but we all sin and we all fell short of the glory of God but God began to pick us up and he began to mold us and make us he had an image in his mind and when he gets done with you you will be a reflection of him the Lions could not eat the prophet because God sent an angel got of put it in our own language the cancer can't eat you cuz God sent an angel Hallelujah he had an angel standing present to protect this Prophet because God had a purpose he wanted to show that Ste self styled King his mighty hand and his purpose I think that's what he's Going's going on today God is getting a people ready that he might show his mighty hand come on somebody that he might show his mighty hand to fulfill his mighty purpose I'm so glad this morning he lives in my heart that he's not a dead God he's a living God and he has a purpose in his mind we're here in 2023 why cuz God has a purpose for it he said yesterday morning I was sitting in a barber chair about to get a a haircut young fell was cutting my hair down at the brother Egan's shop he says I was just sitting there with my head down I would been so tired my meetings have been so long and I'm trying to get away in the morning for a little rest before the next Services began I was so tired just seemed like my heart was just about to quit beating and while I was sitting there all of a sudden I could hear everyone talking but it seemed like I was out in space somewhere I thought have I had a heart attack I'm just leaving for the from the I thought what what wonder what's taking place and I felt my hands they they were so numb and my heart seemed like it quit beating I thought oh but there's a gospel has got to be preached and there's no power that can take me until God's purpose is fulfilled there's nothing that can hurt me not a thing until God's purpose is fulfilled and when I that is fulfilled I want to go with his purpose and when he's finished then I am finished also when he's finished with me and I'm finished with this life when he's finished with you you're finished so what's the difference he make god holds it all in his hand whether you're young whether you're old we don't know what God's purpose will be filled and fulfilled and finished God takes little babies sometimes it show that guide their little soul over into the other place everything he does it for his purpose he said now even a sparrow not even a sparrow can fall from the heavens without him kn everything goes for his purpose just at the hour just at the time it's in his divine plan nothing can destroy it and that's what you have to do when that Devil's coming at you and death is coming up your door you need to look him right in ey and say devil you can't take me until God's purpose for me is finished how was an assurance to Abraham after he found God and he found found out what his true purpose was that in his purpose he was going to bring through Abraham and Sarah a son that was his true purpose Isaac was going to come through Isaac and through that seed was going to come the Lord Jesus and in this purpose he was bringing forth Sarah and Abraham he was going to make them a great people and bring the son taking the very worst persons that could be to do it with wow H takes a prophet to see that taking the very worst people that could be to do it with I felt that way myself why would he make me who I am today seemed like the worst person he could take but God has a purpose and he's fulfilling his purpose sometimes y'all you feel like man I'm the worst person how could God ever love me how could God ever reach down to where I was and find this little lump of clay in that Miry pit and reach down and pick me out who found the worst person seemed like he could find to do it with how strange God's moves in mysterious ways look like if he had wanted to bring a child through to the world like that he' found some woman that was fertile he would found somebody that was Abel and Abraham they' been married many many years and here she was unfertile and God picks them out she couldn't raise a child even on her own she couldn't do it he would have got you think he'd got some young woman that was fertile could have brought forth this child but see God likes to display his grace that's why he picked us out of the my clay that's why he got me out of the mud he likes to display his grace he likes to take something that's nothing and make something out of it for he's a Creator that's what he took in you and I we were nothing we might make that he might make children of his own out of us who is wretched miserable lost blind unlovely to make us his lovely children it's God's purpose to do so and then again it looked like God would have took a young woman or a young man to done this a young man that that you know been married and they they they they they could have produced something but God took somebody that could produce nothing so he could have the glory he takes broken Humanity It seems impossible to make something out of it and raises them up and shows the world look what I have done shows your family look what I have done this wasn't their doing it wasn't their own ideas to go leave you and move across and to go in somewhere else and lose everything but I have brought them here for this purpose and I am raising them up see God chose a man 75 years old and a woman 65 years old to do his purpose to show that he can be both young and old he can do it with both God can still and will work out his purpose no matter the age no matter the problems no matter the sin no matter the trouble no matter what if God sees a purpose in it it will be fulfilled and the Devil comes along and says you know what I'm going to delay it for a while I I'm going to I believe that if I get them so old they'll lose faith if I get them past where it was promised so long they'll finally give up on it say well maybe it was just a hope maybe it was just a maybe maybe it was just a a feeling somebody had it wasn't the Lord maybe just Abraham dreamed something maybe Sarah you know she just thought maybe if I can just delay it enough maybe they'll quit believing in a resurrection if I can just delay it just enough and darkness get thick enough and get so bad that you can't hardly see the hand in front of your face maybe they'll quit quit believing that the dead in Christ is going to rise but God's purpose is going to be fulfilled here they already shaking in their in their bodies at 75 and here they already if I can just keep it away for a while if I can just keep it away until Abraham and Sarah so stupid in age so gray haired so Stoopid shoulder they'll just give up if I can just keep her here so long she'll just give up quit praying for the sick quit having prayer lines quit having altar calls quit a seek seeking after God and asking God Save The Lost bring the prodal home if I can just just delay it long enough but Abraham believed God yes sir Hallelujah I can't tell you how much that scripture did for me as a young preacher when my little boy Andrew is laying in the hospital gasping for air and a man on the radio reads a scripture Abraham believed in God and the devil been telling me the whole reason Andrew is in the hospital because of something i' done or my past and this that and the other and I hear this word Abraham believed in God and I turn the radio off and I I begin to shout out to God I said God if Abraham could believe you in the impossible situation I can also believe you cuz I'm a son of Abraham and I went back and we I told I told sister Ruth I said we're not going to look at this signs we're not going to look at the monitors we're not going to look at nothing we're going to believe in God why because God gave me a revelation cuz Abraham also had a past Abraham also made mistakes Abraham also lied he laughed he done all kinds of things all kinds of wrongs but when it was the New Covenant that came to the Covenant that I'm under the blood that I'm under it said Abraham believed to God and staggered not at the promises of God but was strong in the faith yes sir Hallelujah and God looks through the same blood at me that he looks at Abraham cuz his purpose will be fulfilled God will have a testimony and today we have a testimony of a young man amen whose lungs are perfect why because we serve a god who's a Healer and if the devil can delay you enough and make you disbelieve it you'll go off into disbelief but if you'll stand there and when you done all to stand stand therefore and say I believe it don't God slay me I'm going to trust him he's the one that made the promise and his promise will be [Applause] fulfilled it's his promise it goes to show you when you'll stand nothing can defeat his purpose not even death can defeat his purpose Abraham was as good as dead Sarah's womb was dead for 40 or 50 years but nothing can defeat God's purpose her body was old it was wrinkled the milk veins were dried up her heart was so weak it could have would not have went through labor but God let us know that his purpose would not be defeated he changed Sarah and he made her a young woman again and he took a man that was a hundred years old and he turned him back to youth again no matter how unreasonable it may seem God gave the promise and Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in the faith giving God praise giving God praise for he judged him faithful that he's able to perform what he promised what should we do today we're children of his of the same promise we being dead in Christ we're Abraham's seed and are HS with him according to the promise that no matter how much sickness comes no matter what kind of death we die how much poverty we go through God's purpose cannot be defeated he he raised us up again because I live you shall live also that's our hope am that's our hope because I live ye shall live oh old Abraham could endure as seeing him who is invisible because it was the purpose of God that he knew that God gave him the promise and no matter how contrary everything seemed God gave Abraham that promise and God fulfilled his promise he did to Abraham he did to all his children he will keep every one of his promises Hallelujah 1 John 3:7 says little children I'm going read out of the Amplified Believers dear ones don't you love how he addresses you Believers dear ones do not let anyone Lead You astray the one who practices righteousness the one who strives to live a constantly honorable life in private as well as in public and to conform to God's precepts is righteous just as he is righteous the one who practices sin separating himself from God offending him by acts of Disobedience indifference or Rebellion is of the devil and takes his inner character and moral values from him and not from God for the devil has sinned and violated God's law from the beginning the Son of God appeared for this purpose to destroy the works of the devil Hallelujah not one who's born of God deliberately know and habitually practices sin because God see his principle of Life the essence of his righteous character remains permanently in him who is born again who is reborn from above spiritually transformed renewed and set apart for his purpose and he who is Born Again cannot habitually live a life car characterized by sin because he's born of God and longs to please him by this the children of God and the children of the devil are clearly identified their purposes are fulfilled by that right but those who long to live a life above righteousness above sin the life of righteousness above sin you have been brought you have been brought to the this place you have been made manifest for
