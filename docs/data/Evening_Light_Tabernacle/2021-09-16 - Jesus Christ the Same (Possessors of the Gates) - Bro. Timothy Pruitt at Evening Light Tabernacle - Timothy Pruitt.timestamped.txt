[42:58] thing for believers to be together
[43:02] amen hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8
[43:05] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[43:08] today and forever
[43:10] also genesis 22 and 11
[43:13] and the angel of the lord called unto
[43:15] him out of heaven
[43:17] and said abraham abraham
[43:19] and he said here am i
[43:22] and he said lay not thine hand upon the
[43:24] lad neither do anything unto him
[43:26] for now i know that thou fierce god
[43:28] seeing thou has not withh held thy son
[43:32] that only son from me
[43:34] and abraham lifted up his eyes and
[43:36] looked and behold behind him a ram
[43:39] caught in a thicket by his horns
[43:41] and abraham went and took the ram and
[43:44] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[43:46] the stead of his son
[43:48] and abraham called the name of that
[43:50] place
[43:51] jehovah jireh
[43:53] as is said to this day in the mount of
[43:55] the lord it shall be seen
[43:57] and the angel of the lord called into
[43:59] abraham out
[44:01] of heaven the second time
[44:03] and said by myself have i sworn
[44:06] saith the lord for because thou has done
[44:09] this same
[44:10] and has not withheld thy son thy an only
[44:13] son
[44:14] that in blessing i will bless thee
[44:16] and multiplying i will multiply that
[44:19] seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[44:22] the sand which is upon the seashore and
[44:25] thy seed shall possess the gate of his
[44:28] enemies
[44:30] and in thy seed shall all the nations of
[44:32] the earth be blessed because thou hast
[44:36] obeyed my voice
[44:38] amen
[44:40] we let you be seated
[44:47] like to speak to you this evening on
[44:50] jesus christ the same
[44:52] possessors of the gates
[44:54] amen that's that is us possessors of the
[44:57] gates
[44:58] amen but so i i was looking at this
[45:02] this uh story as we've read of abraham
[45:05] and we know the story of how he waited
[45:08] for many years
[45:09] for a son
[45:11] and and waited for the promise to come
[45:13] to pass and you know no doubt as the
[45:15] days would tick on and it would go on by
[45:18] and time would tarry it seemed like it
[45:20] would never come to pass
[45:23] but the scripture says he staggered not
[45:25] at the promises of god
[45:27] he held on
[45:29] and and you know he held on in the hard
[45:31] times of his life and and and he would
[45:33] also say you know as in hebrews 6 it
[45:36] would talk about how god made the
[45:37] promise to abraham because he could
[45:40] swear by no greater he swore by himself
[45:43] saying surely blessing i will bless see
[45:45] multiply and i will multiply thee and so
[45:48] after he had patiently endured he
[45:51] obtained the promise
[45:53] and and sometimes that's the way it is
[45:55] with us as believers it seems like
[45:57] things are never going to come to pass
[45:59] it's never going to fall in place it's
[46:01] never going to be where we want it to be
[46:03] but we're to patiently endure we're to
[46:06] hang on even in the hardest of times and
[46:09] and when it gets difficult and
[46:11] situations around us and you know life
[46:13] is not affair this life that we live is
[46:15] not a fair life amen it's like as a
[46:18] saying goes life ain't fair there's
[46:20] things that we go through there's things
[46:22] that we face and it seems like that the
[46:24] prophecies of god and and the one that
[46:26] we are as a bride are looking for is the
[46:28] coming of the lord that's the main
[46:31] prophecy that we're waiting on as far as
[46:33] as our hope and our our our longing is
[46:36] to see him return back for us
[46:38] but it seems like in those these days as
[46:40] they go on and here we are year
[46:43] 2021 and seemingly going maybe into
[46:46] another year it seems like the life is
[46:49] getting harder it's getting strong
[46:51] harder to overcome it's getting harder
[46:53] every day of our life i mean we're
[46:55] hearing more and more of cali calamities
[46:58] and and problems around us but it's very
[47:00] important during these times that we
[47:02] don't get our eyes upon the calamities
[47:04] or the problems or the situations but we
[47:07] keep our eye on the promise and this is
[47:10] where abraham would patiently endure
[47:12] that in the time of calamity he still
[47:15] kept his eye on the promise during a
[47:17] good day he would keep his eye on the
[47:19] promise no matter how many years how
[47:21] many days how many times how how
[47:23] difficult the time may seem to have
[47:25] gotten for him amen he would keep his
[47:28] eye on the promise and we know that day
[47:29] finally came it was he would wait
[47:31] there's some 25 years for the promised
[47:34] son and here he receives his isaac and
[47:36] he receives the promise and you know and
[47:39] god does what's seemingly a very strange
[47:41] thing he he tells him to take him up to
[47:43] a mountain and offer him for a sacrifice
[47:46] but you know the abraham was so faithful
[47:49] that he never really brother branham
[47:51] said he never thought one moment about
[47:52] it
[47:53] matter of fact the scripture says he got
[47:55] up early the next morning he did he
[47:57] didn't early that morning he didn't even
[47:59] take days to think about it or ponder
[48:01] about it or or wonder how god's going to
[48:03] do all of this he knew if god gave him
[48:05] the promise god was able to keep the
[48:08] promise
[48:09] amen so he never refused to do it he
[48:11] just got up and as the lord spoke to him
[48:13] and he saddled up his mules and he took
[48:16] some wood and he chopped it and took off
[48:18] you know he gets to a place the
[48:20] scripture said he went about a three-day
[48:21] journey and he and he turns it to his
[48:24] servants he said i want you to wait here
[48:26] you know i really like this about
[48:28] abraham he said i want you to wait here
[48:30] with the mules i and my son will go
[48:33] yonder to worship and we shall return
[48:37] we shall return what was it abraham was
[48:40] turning his faith loose
[48:42] and i believe that there's ever a time
[48:44] in our lives as the time is right now
[48:47] that we begin to speak the promises of
[48:49] god we begin to speak what god has given
[48:52] us in this hour and we turn our faith
[48:54] loose how you turn your faithful is by
[48:57] speaking the word of god amen this is
[48:59] what abraham was doing he was speaking
[49:01] the promise the promise was isaac the
[49:04] promise was the promised son and he said
[49:06] we are going to return to this place you
[49:08] know brother branham said when you
[49:10] receive the holy spirit everything that
[49:12] you have need of and the earth the
[49:13] earthly journey is in you right that
[49:15] then he said but what it is you need to
[49:18] turn it loose and let it go to work
[49:20] let your faith loose let your faith
[49:23] loose in the promises of god and believe
[49:26] god no matter what the circumstances no
[49:28] matter what he asks you to do believe
[49:30] god no matter what day you ask you to
[49:33] walk through believe god no matter what
[49:35] situation you find yourself in you
[49:37] believe god amen no matter how difficult
[49:40] it may seem you believe god it's time
[49:43] that you let your faith loose in god's
[49:45] spirit and when you do that he said it
[49:48] let makes your body come into subjection
[49:51] to what god's redemptive blessings for
[49:53] you are
[49:54] did you catch that he said if you'll let
[49:56] your faith loose in god's spirit it'll
[50:00] bring your body into subjection to all
[50:02] the redemptive blessings that are for
[50:04] you and anything that jesus died for
[50:07] he's sitting there tonight to make the
[50:10] intercession for you amen that you can
[50:12] have it upon your confession and this is
[50:15] exactly what abraham was doing he was
[50:17] confessing me and the lads going but me
[50:20] and the lads returning
[50:23] even though god has said go on offer him
[50:25] he knew that god would provide a
[50:27] sacrifice
[50:29] oh come on now and so upon his
[50:31] confession he began to confess before it
[50:34] ever happened before he knew he didn't
[50:35] know how it was going to turn out he
[50:37] just knew god was faithful to the
[50:39] promise
[50:42] amen he said whatever you confess that
[50:44] he's done and believe it that's your
[50:45] personal property every believer every
[50:48] person that's born again i mean he's
[50:50] born again tonight has the right to any
[50:53] redemptive blessings
[50:55] he said when you get saved jesus takes a
[50:58] and hands you a checkbook and lasts you
[51:00] all through life's journey and his name
[51:03] is signed at the bottom of every one of
[51:04] them whatsoever you ask in my name it
[51:07] shall be done he said just just sign it
[51:10] let it turn it loose let it go send it
[51:13] to the bank of heaven and see if he
[51:15] won't bring it to pass
[51:18] abraham didn't know how it was going to
[51:20] be he didn't know how it was all going
[51:22] to work out but he knew he had the
[51:24] promise
[51:25] amen that's all that mattered
[51:28] do you under did you hear me the promise
[51:31] is all that matters
[51:33] it what it don't matter how he's going
[51:35] to bring it to pass because many times
[51:37] he'll bring it to pass way beyond what
[51:39] you was thinking or way different than
[51:41] how i was thinking amen all that matters
[51:44] is i have the promise
[51:47] how is he going to do
[51:48] it we don't know
[51:51] abraham didn't know
[51:53] you know he was told to go up there and
[51:54] sacrifice to kill him god said go up
[51:56] there and take his life
[51:58] you know what the bible says and it says
[52:00] in hebrews 11 and verse 17 it says by
[52:03] faith abraham
[52:04] when he was tried he offered up isaac
[52:07] and he that had received the promise
[52:09] offered up his only begotten son
[52:12] of whom it was said that in isaac shall
[52:15] thy seed be called accounting that god
[52:18] was able to raise him up
[52:21] even from the dead he'd already received
[52:23] him as one from the dead because
[52:25] abraham's body was a dead i mean he had
[52:27] no seed
[52:29] sarah's body was dead her womb was dried
[52:31] up so he received the promise already
[52:34] one time as one from the dead so he knew
[52:37] if god done it before god will do it
[52:39] again
[52:40] abraham was already preaching in this
[52:42] moment jesus christ the same yesterday
[52:45] today and forever the same god that gave
[52:48] me isaac the first time is the same one
[52:50] that can raise him up the second time
[52:54] accounting this word is something it's a
[52:56] really uh you know like i guess i get
[52:58] the the word accounting from as far as
[53:01] the as taking care of numbers
[53:04] this is a word
[53:05] that is not dealing with made with a
[53:07] maybe
[53:09] it's a reality
[53:12] it's not a it's it's it actually says it
[53:14] like this it says this word is not
[53:16] actually don't actually it means if
[53:18] you're accounting there's 25 in your
[53:21] bank account it's not close
[53:25] it's not plus or minus
[53:27] is 25
[53:29] amen it's a reality there's 25
[53:33] in there not 26 or 27
[53:36] there's 25 dollars in there so abraham
[53:39] knew or accounted god is able to raise
[53:43] him up the reality is he's able to raise
[53:46] him up
[53:47] the reality is he's able to fulfill his
[53:50] promise no matter how difficult it is
[53:53] and it ain't going to be plus or minus
[53:55] is going to be what the promise said
[53:58] and he's going to bring it to pass
[54:03] you know some people in their bank
[54:04] accounts are good with plus or minus
[54:07] you know but if you get a real
[54:09] accountant
[54:11] he's not good with maybe it's 25 or
[54:14] maybe it's 25 000 or maybe it's 20 this
[54:17] or whatever he wants to know to the
[54:18] penny
[54:20] amen because he's a good accountant
[54:23] amen and so we're not looking at the
[54:25] promises as it may be
[54:28] as it might be
[54:29] if you're really accounting that god is
[54:31] able you're looking at that promise and
[54:34] saying it's 25
[54:36] amen it's 25 cents and brother branham
[54:38] would say it he said if you have gave
[54:39] you a quarter it's not 26 cents or 27
[54:43] cents it's the purchase price of bread
[54:45] amen it's it's a it's given an account a
[54:47] counting or a number exact number an
[54:50] exact figure and this is what the
[54:52] promises of god they are amen they are
[54:54] yay they are exact
[54:57] they have a perfect day to bring
[54:59] fulfillment it won't be on a day before
[55:01] or day after it will fulfill the time of
[55:04] its fulfillment no matter what man says
[55:06] or decrees no matter what the devil says
[55:08] or decrees it will fulfill
[55:12] amen so we we'd have to look at it not
[55:15] and you know in a general sense as maybe
[55:17] it's going to happen or or you know
[55:19] maybe i'll get healed or maybe i want my
[55:21] my children to come back or no

[59:08] and being not weak in faith
[59:11] he considered not his own body now dead
[59:14] when he was about a hundred years old
[59:16] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[59:20] but he staggered not at the promises of
[59:22] god
[59:23] through unbelief
[59:24] but was strong in the faith

[59:58] talking was blasting about men that was
[1:00:00] wearing the britches halfway down their

[1:00:58] but abraham said you wait here
[1:01:00] how's he going to do it i can't tell you
[1:01:03] i don't know how he's going to do it i
[1:01:05] just know he's going to do it
[1:01:07] but he's going to do it because he
[1:01:09] promised he would
[1:01:10] i don't know how he's going to move in
[1:01:12] an impossible situation but i've seen
[1:01:14] that he's done it before he'll do it
[1:01:16] again
[1:01:18] i don't know how he's going to end up
[1:01:19] all this and take a bribe without spot
[1:01:22] or without wrinkle but i know he will
[1:01:24] because it's in the account
[1:01:26] and he's faithful to it and he swore
[1:01:29] that he would
[1:01:30] amen god come to abraham he said i'm
[1:01:33] going to swear not by you abraham not by
[1:01:35] isaac not by these mountains i'm going
[1:01:38] to swear by there's nothing greater than
[1:01:40] myself i'm putting myself in the account
[1:01:43] [Applause]
[1:01:45] oh hallelujah when he put himself in
[1:01:47] your account that's an unlimited
[1:01:50] resource that's an unlimited under under
[1:01:53] this
[1:01:54] you can buy anything you want to buy
[1:01:56] that's in the bible
[1:01:59] you can cash it in what's in the bible
[1:02:01] you can have it
[1:02:07] i know we will
[1:02:08] this boy and i
[1:02:10] will return will you wait here we're
[1:02:12] going to worship so he put the word on
[1:02:14] on little isaac's back we know there's a
[1:02:16] type of christ
[1:02:17] packing his cross
[1:02:19] he got up to the top of the mountain
[1:02:21] you know and isaac got a little
[1:02:23] suspicious
[1:02:25] he he'd been to church before apparently
[1:02:29] he's like uh
[1:02:31] daddy
[1:02:32] there's wood
[1:02:34] there's a
[1:02:35] altar we got a fire
[1:02:37] where's the sacrifice
[1:02:41] listen to what came out of abraham's
[1:02:43] lips
[1:02:44] my son
[1:02:45] god will provide for himself a lamb
[1:02:48] he will provide a sacrifice
[1:02:51] amen god had been testing abraham
[1:02:54] because he had given him the promise
[1:02:57] when god makes a promise he wants to
[1:02:59] make sure that this person he give it to
[1:03:01] us worthy of the promise before he
[1:03:03] fulfills the promise
[1:03:06] amen so abraham had been promised that
[1:03:09] through his sea the whole world would be
[1:03:11] blessed and he'd have a son now the son
[1:03:14] amen if we bring forth a seed that would
[1:03:16] bless the whole earth
[1:03:18] and abraham when the promise was given
[1:03:20] to 75 years and here's why years old and
[1:03:23] his wife 65 years but the bible as we
[1:03:26] read said he's staggered not
[1:03:31] at the promises of god
[1:03:37] and god tested and god time after time
[1:03:39] tested him
[1:03:41] but he came to this final test
[1:03:43] before the blessing was going to happen
[1:03:46] now listen to what brother branham says
[1:03:47] about that he said that's the way it is
[1:03:49] with every seed of abraham
[1:03:53] god gives us the final test just before
[1:03:55] he gives the promise
[1:03:58] fulfills the promise that final test to
[1:04:00] see how you will react
[1:04:03] wow
[1:04:04] and when he gave abraham this test he
[1:04:07] found abraham just as true as he was
[1:04:09] when he started
[1:04:11] what a blessing it would be this morning
[1:04:13] if we could take his promise of healing
[1:04:15] and stand there just as true as we did
[1:04:18] when we stood and accepted it no matter
[1:04:20] what the doctor said the promise is
[1:04:24] true want you to understand the doctor
[1:04:27] ain't in his words it hasn't it it's not
[1:04:30] like you know the stock market and the
[1:04:32] stock market can hear about a they can
[1:04:34] hear about some of the silliest things
[1:04:35] sometimes
[1:04:38] or you can hear something go way up
[1:04:40] but the doctor's
[1:04:43] words
[1:04:44] does nothing to the value of the account
[1:04:49] it still has the same value
[1:04:52] it still produces the same thing
[1:04:55] amen the doctor's words do not diminish
[1:04:58] the value of your account
[1:05:00] amen is still there the devil cannot do
[1:05:03] anything to diminish the value of the
[1:05:05] account
[1:05:06] amen and when he did this
[1:05:09] when abraham did this he never withheld
[1:05:11] his only son
[1:05:13] but he's about to plunge the knife into
[1:05:15] his bosom here he had testified all over
[1:05:18] the earth as he'd go to different places
[1:05:20] i'm going to receive a son or abraham
[1:05:22] you're 75 you're 85 yeah i don't care
[1:05:24] i'm going to receive a son 95 i'm going
[1:05:26] to receive his son and now he's taking
[1:05:28] that testimony and laying him on an
[1:05:30] altar
[1:05:32] ain't going to take his life
[1:05:35] he was asked to brother and put it like
[1:05:36] this he was asked to double back and
[1:05:39] destroy the only hope he had for his
[1:05:41] testimony to be fulfilled
[1:05:44] but when god seen that he was loyal to
[1:05:47] that faith that he had in god god looked
[1:05:49] out of the heavens and he said i've
[1:05:50] swore by myself that i'll bless you and
[1:05:54] multiply you and your seed shall possess
[1:05:57] the gate of his enemy
[1:06:00] what was it because of his confession
[1:06:04] god will provide a sacrifice
[1:06:07] god will fulfill this i don't know how
[1:06:09] he's going to do it i just know he's
[1:06:11] going to do it
[1:06:15] he's also
[1:06:16] in the bible with rebecca
[1:06:18] it was a prophecy over rebecca and i
[1:06:20] thought that was very brother branham
[1:06:22] would actually take both of these
[1:06:23] scriptures and tie them together
[1:06:25] and rebecca you know what she was
[1:06:27] eliezer had went to the well and and
[1:06:30] we'd go through all that but to save
[1:06:31] time it comes down to the moment and it
[1:06:33] goes and asks their family and they said
[1:06:35] well you know
[1:06:37] we don't know
[1:06:38] when when she could go but ask her
[1:06:41] we don't know if she will go ask her
[1:06:45] was she gonna go with this stranger that
[1:06:46] brought some gifts and the camels and
[1:06:48] and all this we'll get that we'll get
[1:06:50] the damsel and let her speak we'll hear
[1:06:53] from her mouth where she'll go yes or no
[1:06:55] he said that's the way it's brought to
[1:06:57] all the seed of god it's got to be your
[1:07:00] mouth
[1:07:02] hello somebody
[1:07:03] it ain't just good enough for the
[1:07:04] preacher to preach it and and to say it
[1:07:06] it's got to come from your mouth
[1:07:09] what whose report will you believe
[1:07:13] amen are we going to are we going to
[1:07:14] just sit back and just say nothing or
[1:07:16] are we going to speak the word of god
[1:07:18] we're going to just look back and act
[1:07:20] like nothing's going on are we going to
[1:07:21] speak to what god wants to hear from you
[1:07:25] he wants to hear what you're going to
[1:07:26] say about it what you want to say about
[1:07:28] the situation what you're going to say
[1:07:30] about what you're going through
[1:07:34] did you get it he makes you go through
[1:07:36] things so he can hear what you are going
[1:07:38] to say about it
[1:07:41] he allows you to go through difficult
[1:07:43] situations so he can hear what you will
[1:07:46] say about it
[1:07:48] not what a preacher says about it or
[1:07:50] what somebody else said but what you
[1:07:52] will say about it
[1:07:54] this is why he let
[1:07:55] job go through what he went through he
[1:07:57] wanted to hear what job was going to say
[1:07:59] about it
[1:08:00] what did job say though god slayed me
[1:08:02] yet i'll trust him
[1:08:05] i know my redeemer lives
[1:08:07] amen though these skin worms destroy my
[1:08:09] body yet in my flesh i'll see god amen
[1:08:12] he started confessing he started
[1:08:14] speaking the word of god right in the
[1:08:16] middle of the hardest trials
[1:08:20] listen it's easy to speak the promises
[1:08:22] of god when life is rosy
[1:08:25] it's easy to worship on a wednesday
[1:08:26] night when everything boy you had the
[1:08:28] best day
[1:08:29] best day ever you know and best week
[1:08:32] ever and everything's i doubt i don't
[1:08:34] know if anybody had that today
[1:08:42] but it's easy when things are going good
[1:08:44] and you got you know you got a good
[1:08:45] cushion in the bank account
[1:08:47] you got things rolling your way and you
[1:08:49] got
[1:08:50] you know
[1:08:53] but god wants to hear what you're going
[1:08:54] to say about it
[1:08:56] when there's nothing in the bank account
[1:08:59] when there's nothing that you can do
[1:09:01] anymore and you can't go in others you
[1:09:03] there's no decision you can even make he
[1:09:06] wants to know then what you're going to
[1:09:07] say about it
[1:09:09] he wants to know then what your worship
[1:09:11] is going to be
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:17] i don't know what it does to you
[1:09:20] but when i see the devil doing things to
[1:09:22] god's people
[1:09:24] and to god's children and to myself to
[1:09:26] my family
[1:09:27] it makes me want to go harder
[1:09:31] he's pretty stupid i don't think he's
[1:09:33] figured that out yet because it makes me
[1:09:35] want to just push the sword a little bit
[1:09:37] deeper
[1:09:40] you know when i see him doing what he's
[1:09:41] been doing and and moving in
[1:09:44] in the body of christ and divisions and
[1:09:46] this that and the other it makes me want
[1:09:48] to go even harder study more
[1:09:52] find that inspiration
[1:09:54] go after it a little harder push a
[1:09:56] little harder don't stop this ain't the
[1:09:58] time to be you know kicking back and
[1:10:00] kicking our heels up and saying well we
[1:10:02] you know we're no have you ever seen a
[1:10:04] time such as this
[1:10:07] i was thinking about it today when i in
[1:10:09] my lifetime
[1:10:10] i don't know if i've ever heard of so
[1:10:12] much death
[1:10:15] so much calamity
[1:10:17] so many maybe it's because well we've
[1:10:18] had social media for a long time and i
[1:10:20] still ain't never heard of it like i've
[1:10:22] heard of it now
[1:10:24] but in these moments
[1:10:26] god wants to hear what you're going to
[1:10:28] say
[1:10:31] that's where abraham was brought to he's
[1:10:32] brought to this moment
[1:10:35] and he's leading his son his only son
[1:10:37] could you imagine what it was he still
[1:10:39] was a man he had feelings
[1:10:41] and thoughts and things that were going
[1:10:43] through his mind and he's wondering
[1:10:44] what's going to happen in his mind he's
[1:10:46] thinking he'd cast it down
[1:10:48] god's a provider
[1:10:51] god can move
[1:10:54] he's going
[1:10:55] what about his whisper over there what
[1:10:57] about your son
[1:10:58] he's going to he told you to kill him
[1:11:00] and where are you going to get the
[1:11:01] promise now what's going to happen now
[1:11:04] it's going to be you get them they're
[1:11:05] going to make fun of you they're going
[1:11:06] to but he's a provider
[1:11:09] he's jehovah jireh
[1:11:11] he's a provider he shall provide for
[1:11:13] himself a sacrifice and this is where he
[1:11:15] kept going until it would come out of
[1:11:17] his mouth and now it's come to rebecca
[1:11:19] and she's asked in the moment but
[1:11:21] brother brown said when she was put to
[1:11:23] the test she never hesitated a minute
[1:11:27] she didn't go back to her bedroom and
[1:11:29] think about it
[1:11:30] she said i will go
[1:11:33] and he said i like that he said not let
[1:11:36] me make up my mind let me study it over
[1:11:38] she was fully persuaded he said that's
[1:11:41] the people that god can use
[1:11:44] you want to be used of god be fully
[1:11:47] persuaded
[1:11:48] you want to be used of god be all in
[1:11:51] if you want to be used of god say i will
[1:11:54] go
[1:11:57] and are people then so anointed he says
[1:12:00] maybe they didn't know it but they put
[1:12:02] their hands on her and they began to
[1:12:03] prophesy over this little young jewish
[1:12:06] girl
[1:12:07] and they put it on a camel and center
[1:12:08] upon upon
[1:12:10] us unto a strange people but there was
[1:12:12] something on them as they said let thy
[1:12:15] seed possess the gate of their enemy and
[1:12:18] be thou a mother of thousands of
[1:12:20] millions
[1:12:22] thy seed shall possess the gate of its
[1:12:24] enemy that's god's sworn promise he said
[1:12:27] by that holy spirit seeing that mother
[1:12:30] was to be part of the son also because
[1:12:32] they're part of the same flesh then the
[1:12:34] holy spirit working through these people
[1:12:37] laid their hands on them and said let
[1:12:39] thy sea possess the gate of the enemy
[1:12:42] then god swear and he possessed again to
[1:12:44] the enemy what position does that put
[1:12:47] the church of the living god in tonight
[1:12:51] hallelujah she was typing the church of
[1:12:53] god
[1:12:56] here's a type of christ and here's a
[1:12:58] type of the church
[1:13:01] and the same word for the bridegroom
[1:13:03] it's the same word for the bride
[1:13:07] and just as he overcame and possessed
[1:13:10] the gates so shall the bride overcome
[1:13:12] and possess the gates of the
[1:13:16] enemy we are abraham's seed
[1:13:19] and we being dead in christ we are heirs
[1:13:22] with him under the same sworn promise
[1:13:25] we are abraham's seed and are heirs to
[1:13:27] every promise
[1:13:28] that was given him but when the testings
[1:13:30] come many times if we're not careful
[1:13:32] that's where we fail he said but i don't
[1:13:34] believe that the true seed of abraham
[1:13:36] will fail
[1:13:38] they'll stand just as gallant and loyal
[1:13:41] as abraham did
[1:13:43] oh hallelujah but what does the gates
[1:13:46] mean what was the gates representing you
[1:13:48] know i was looking into some of this and
[1:13:50] and you know most of the cities and
[1:13:52] large towns in that day were surrounded
[1:13:55] by walls of some kind
[1:13:57] uh they would either have some kind of
[1:13:58] stick fence or uh
[1:14:00] or to all the way to high stones that
[1:14:03] were made for the wall of defense
[1:14:06] the idea was to be able to protect the
[1:14:08] inhabitants at night from animals that
[1:14:10] might wander in and most of all to
[1:14:12] protect the city from
[1:14:15] from humans that are thieves or bandits
[1:14:17] and and conquering armies but this gate
[1:14:21] or gates however many was in that city
[1:14:23] were the only way in or out of that city
[1:14:27] so all the commercial traffic entered
[1:14:29] and exited through the gates and thus
[1:14:31] the city gate became a place of all kind
[1:14:33] of important activity in the life of the
[1:14:36] city and its inhabitants the area near
[1:14:38] the gate became a literal marketplace
[1:14:40] where commodities from the farmers that
[1:14:42] lived outside would bring them to the
[1:14:44] gates and you could read it in the
[1:14:46] scriptures and would bring it to the
[1:14:48] gates and they would sell them right
[1:14:49] there in the gate of the city
[1:14:51] increased commerce gave rise you know to
[1:14:53] dispute so
[1:14:54] you know they'd bring the courts and men
[1:14:57] elders of high renown and not
[1:15:00] necessarily the old but just respected
[1:15:02] men would sit there in that area and
[1:15:04] would bring the wisdom of their
[1:15:06] experience and insight and they would
[1:15:08] settle the disputes and even the king
[1:15:10] would sometimes come to the gates and
[1:15:12] sit there and decree laws and things so
[1:15:15] the gate was a very important place to
[1:15:17] the city
[1:15:18] and it was a center for even political
[1:15:21] activities or even you know mustering up
[1:15:23] an army to go and fight kings you know
[1:15:26] as i said would sit there and
[1:15:28] dispense judgment and take the political
[1:15:30] pulse of the people so it was showing
[1:15:32] that there's power right there in the
[1:15:35] gates
[1:15:36] and we know how the enemy amen would try
[1:15:39] to come and he tries to either wall
[1:15:41] people in or wall people away from
[1:15:44] something
[1:15:45] and so the gate in that city though was
[1:15:48] actually the weakest part you wouldn't
[1:15:50] you know if you tried to go against
[1:15:52] something you wouldn't necessarily go
[1:15:53] against the strong walls or or you know
[1:15:56] where they could shoot you down from you
[1:15:57] take a battering ram and you'd smash it
[1:16:00] against the gates and you try to because
[1:16:02] it had a the weakest link and you try to
[1:16:04] take that and so god was telling abraham
[1:16:07] your seed will possess the seed of the
[1:16:10] gate
[1:16:12] that would possess the gates of the
[1:16:13] enemy in other words they would possess
[1:16:16] the place of authority they would
[1:16:18] possess the place the place where
[1:16:20] rulership went from and and and things
[1:16:23] took place and so the enemy wants to
[1:16:25] come in he wants to wall you and he
[1:16:28] wants to blow you in or wall you out
[1:16:30] amen but you have been given position
[1:16:32] over that place
[1:16:35] therefore there's no way no way because
[1:16:37] you have the you have the ability or the
[1:16:39] rulership over the gate therefore you
[1:16:42] have the ability to go in or go out you
[1:16:44] have the ability the rulership amen to
[1:16:47] to do whatever you have need of because
[1:16:50] it's in your inheritance
[1:16:53] hallelujah so he's trying to maybe wall
[1:16:56] you out by while you're in by sin or
[1:16:58] while you in by fear but the gate has
[1:17:01] been tore down
[1:17:04] and it's not him at the gate anymore you
[1:17:06] have rulership over the gate
[1:17:10] and we know our bodies we go into all
[1:17:12] that has gates it comes that allows
[1:17:14] things to come in amen you know even
[1:17:17] just the sita smell and fear in here are
[1:17:19] filling here that's that's all gates
[1:17:23] but you've been given rulership by the
[1:17:25] holy spirit over those gates
[1:17:28] and there's others the other gates to
[1:17:30] the spirit and all of that and you've
[1:17:32] been given the rulership to dictate what
[1:17:34] takes place now we can look down to the
[1:17:37] bible and we can see amen many of many
[1:17:39] of the seed of abraham how they would
[1:17:42] take over the gate they would take over
[1:17:44] the rulership and we could we could see
[1:17:46] how moses went down and he would begin
[1:17:49] to take over rulership over egypt with
[1:17:51] just a rod
[1:17:52] he would actually take the authority
[1:17:54] over a great army
[1:17:57] he would take he would be able to sit in
[1:17:59] a place of rulership actually even
[1:18:01] though they may not have recognized him
[1:18:03] to be a ruler they may not thought him
[1:18:05] and to be a ruler but he was ruling over
[1:18:07] their their circumstances he was ruling
[1:18:09] over their fields he was ruling over
[1:18:11] their cities they made bringing fries
[1:18:14] and fleas and frogs and hell and rain
[1:18:16] amen god had given him position over the
[1:18:19] gate of authority
[1:18:21] hallelujah and you know brother brown
[1:18:23] would talk about how he'd even come down
[1:18:24] the red sea and god gave him the key
[1:18:27] amen the gate to go across into the into
[1:18:30] the toward the promised land because you
[1:18:32] there was a word that spoke of him you
[1:18:35] shall possess the gate of the enemy
[1:18:40] now that's not going to mean you're not
[1:18:42] going to have issues and things arise
[1:18:45] but you've been given rulership over the
[1:18:47] gate
[1:18:51] even brother branham talk about him
[1:18:53] possession possessing the gates of your
[1:18:55] enemy this is a wonderful
[1:18:57] quotation here he said he talks about
[1:18:59] how they went across the red sea and
[1:19:01] they get over into the wilderness
[1:19:03] he said just a few moments
[1:19:06] trials begin to come
[1:19:08] instead of keeping their eye on the
[1:19:10] promise
[1:19:11] see if they had done just like abraham
[1:19:12] done
[1:19:13] they'd have been the promised land many
[1:19:15] years before
[1:19:17] but they got their eyes off of it and
[1:19:19] when trials came and
[1:19:21] they they didn't judge him faithful i
[1:19:23] mean
[1:19:24] you know they
[1:19:25] and they lost the rulership of the gate
[1:19:30] intentions begin to come into the church
[1:19:34] you know brother brown said every or the
[1:19:36] bible says every son that cometh to god
[1:19:38] must be tried and proven and tested
[1:19:40] brother brown said he let sicknesses
[1:19:42] strike you he lets diseases come on you
[1:19:45] to test you
[1:19:47] to see what you're going to say about it
[1:19:51] to show the world that you truly are the
[1:19:53] seed of abraham he permits it by his own
[1:19:57] will he said he even allows tensions to
[1:19:59] come in a congregation
[1:20:00] just to see what you're going to say
[1:20:02] about it
[1:20:04] he permits it by his will he permits
[1:20:06] disasters he permits friends to turn
[1:20:09] against you he permits things he turns
[1:20:12] the devil is to tempt you he'll do it
[1:20:14] all but take your life he could throw
[1:20:16] you on the bed of affliction he could
[1:20:17] turn your neighbors against you he could
[1:20:19] turn the church against you he can
[1:20:20] almost do anything it's god's will for
[1:20:23] him to do it
[1:20:27] help help
[1:20:30] but we are taught that it's more
[1:20:32] precious than gold to us
[1:20:37] but he's wanted to see what you're going
[1:20:39] to say about it
[1:20:42] too many times we we hear something
[1:20:44] that's going on in the church and we
[1:20:45] just jump right in and we haven't even
[1:20:47] know we don't even know the sides of the
[1:20:49] story enough to even make a righteous
[1:20:51] judgment
[1:20:52] before we know it we don't jumped on the
[1:20:54] wrong side
[1:20:58] but god's allowing things to come just
[1:21:00] to see what you're going to do about it
[1:21:03] how are you going to react
[1:21:07] what's going to be your response
[1:21:13] sometimes you know you have to
[1:21:15] stand alone
[1:21:18] sometimes it brings you to a final
[1:21:19] moment and you're in the decision
[1:21:21] when everything everybody's moved away
[1:21:24] and you're standing alone
[1:21:26] you walk out there and say
[1:21:32] no you walk out there and you say don't
[1:21:35] god save me
[1:21:38] yet i'll trust him
[1:21:41] no matter what goes on around me i know
[1:21:44] he hasn't lost control
[1:21:47] no matter what's happening around me and
[1:21:49] the waves are crashing and things are
[1:21:51] going on i know he's still on the throne
[1:21:57] and though all hell is tell me
[1:22:01] i shall not be moved
[1:22:10] that's the seed of abraham
[1:22:13] that's the one that gave the promise no
[1:22:15] matter what the rest of them says what
[1:22:16] the rest of them do
[1:22:18] for me and my house we're going to serve
[1:22:20] god
[1:22:22] but the rest of them says there's
[1:22:23] nothing to the experience if the rest of
[1:22:26] them says it's a bunch of excitement for
[1:22:27] me in my house we're going to serve god
[1:22:31] he said i'd like to take up with paul
[1:22:32] right there and say in the way that it's
[1:22:34] called heresy so worship by the god of
[1:22:37] our fathers
[1:22:40] hallelujah
[1:22:41] oh hallelujah
[1:22:43] oh my i never forget going over i think
[1:22:45] i've told this but it's a it was a
[1:22:47] wonderful experience going over there
[1:22:48] into czech republic with brother danny
[1:22:50] steeman another brother took us into
[1:22:52] this cave beautiful
[1:22:54] beautiful cave of all kind of
[1:22:57] things the lag tights i don't remember
[1:22:59] all the names all kinds of stuff hanging
[1:23:00] from the ceiling growing up from the
[1:23:02] floor
[1:23:03] we walked to this one place and there's
[1:23:05] nothing but a dusty looking room black
[1:23:08] you see smoke look like black soot or
[1:23:10] something on the ceiling
[1:23:13] and the woman was talking
[1:23:15] in in her native language and brother
[1:23:18] asking what she was saying he kind of
[1:23:20] laughed and kind of smiled at me and
[1:23:22] she's saying that we're standing in the
[1:23:24] room where heretics had church
[1:23:31] i felt right at home
[1:23:34] that's like in the way it's called
[1:23:36] heresy so worship by the god of our
[1:23:39] fathers standing right in a place where
[1:23:41] men and women have running away from
[1:23:43] that catholic system so they can worship
[1:23:46] god
[1:23:49] amen and here we are again in the same
[1:23:51] places pressure on every hand situations
[1:23:54] on every side
[1:23:56] judas has walked away from us
[1:24:00] it's only just a moment that he's going
[1:24:01] to turn and bring back the soldiers
[1:24:07] judas has got to do what judas does
[1:24:10] they've already blasphemed the holy
[1:24:11] ghost
[1:24:13] there's no hope for him
[1:24:17] they want to send out judgments there's
[1:24:19] judgments that's coming upon them
[1:24:26] he said though there'd be tattlers
[1:24:28] coming to church
[1:24:29] those will be twisters all kind of false
[1:24:31] prophets everything that into the church
[1:24:33] among the people in the neighborhood and
[1:24:34] everything but for me and my house we're
[1:24:37] going to serve the lord though all of
[1:24:39] them quit coming
[1:24:42] though the church gets cold and
[1:24:44] different me and my house we're going to
[1:24:46] serve the lord
[1:24:48] though someone's prayed for and didn't
[1:24:50] get it well has nothing to do with it
[1:24:54] i want you to understand though my mama
[1:24:56] went into the grave after prayer after
[1:24:58] prayer has nothing to do with it as for
[1:25:01] me and my house we're going to serve the
[1:25:03] lord
[1:25:08] testings and trials come but it's for me
[1:25:11] and my house
[1:25:19] he said men are not infallible but god
[1:25:21] is
[1:25:22] you get your mind on a man he'll make a
[1:25:24] mistake maybe not willfully but he'll do
[1:25:26] it
[1:25:27] god sometimes permits him to do so
[1:25:30] to see if it'll shake your faith
[1:25:33] and to shake your faith away from man
[1:25:37] our faith is not in the wisdom of man
[1:25:38] but in the power of the resurrection of
[1:25:40] jesus christ that's where the true seed
[1:25:42] of abraham's rest their
[1:25:44] promise and the rest of their promise
[1:25:46] because they can only be the seed of
[1:25:47] abraham when they have received the holy
[1:25:49] ghost without the holy spirit you're not
[1:25:52] a seed of abraham he said well i'm in
[1:25:54] the message you're not in the seat of
[1:25:55] abraham unless you've got the holy ghost
[1:25:58] that's what makes you the seed
[1:26:03] otherwise there's just a bunch of
[1:26:04] intellectual knowledge
[1:26:06] and you'll out argue somebody's sitting
[1:26:08] on a bar stool
[1:26:10] and if it's a bunch of intellectual
[1:26:11] knowledge you how you'll decide that
[1:26:13] it's okay to have a glass of wine every
[1:26:14] once in a while you'll decide it's okay
[1:26:16] to wear certain kind of dresses because
[1:26:18] it's up here and not here
[1:26:20] but if it ever gets here
[1:26:22] that's what makes you a seed of abraham
[1:26:27] otherwise you're just the seed of the
[1:26:28] bonds woman
[1:26:31] make
[1:26:34] believe we can see many of them let's go
[1:26:37] on down
[1:26:39] get get get here pretty quick i'm
[1:26:40] running out of time
[1:26:45] but we know as we could watch all the
[1:26:48] ones the seeds of abraham shamgar
[1:26:51] possessed the gate i mean david
[1:26:53] possessed the gate
[1:26:55] daniel possessed the gate hebrew
[1:26:57] children
[1:26:58] all the highlights but i mean all the
[1:27:00] seeds of abraham possessed in the gate
[1:27:02] but what was it speaking of the royal
[1:27:05] seed to come
[1:27:07] and he would
[1:27:08] be born not of a man but he'd be born of
[1:27:10] a virgin
[1:27:11] with the power in his veins to conquer
[1:27:13] death and hell oh my god made a promise
[1:27:16] an ordinary man couldn't do it but if
[1:27:18] god makes a promise he's just the same
[1:27:20] god he was a few minutes ago when he was
[1:27:23] talking about abraham and jehovah jireh
[1:27:25] the lord shall provide a way to take the
[1:27:28] gate
[1:27:29] amen if there's a gate that needs to be
[1:27:31] conquered god will provide a way to take
[1:27:33] that gate moses died the rest of them
[1:27:36] die but god said he shall possess the
[1:27:38] gate of his enemy who's going to possess
[1:27:40] death he's got a way of doing things he
[1:27:42] shall possess the gate of his enemy and
[1:27:45] the royal sea was born he was tempted in
[1:27:47] every manner as we are just as we've
[1:27:50] been tempted so was he the devil quickly
[1:27:52] taken him over after he received the
[1:27:54] holy spirit and what did he do he didn't
[1:27:56] go to his power he went to it is written
[1:27:59] showing again the same word that worked
[1:28:01] with abraham works in this day
[1:28:04] what are you going to say about it it is
[1:28:06] written
[1:28:07] amen
[1:28:09] his death they drove nails in his hand
[1:28:11] they spit in his face went through every
[1:28:13] sickness but when he was on earth he
[1:28:16] proved he could conquer sickness and he
[1:28:18] conquered it conquered every gate of
[1:28:20] sickness he conquered leprosy he
[1:28:22] conquered fevers he conquered
[1:28:24] blindness he conquered deafness just
[1:28:26] name it he conquered it
[1:28:29] and he comes all the way he conquered
[1:28:31] sickness he conquered temptation when
[1:28:34] the enemy spit him in the face smote his
[1:28:36] jaw he turned his other side he jerked
[1:28:38] his beard and spit on he never riled
[1:28:40] back he conquered the gate of temptation
[1:28:43] he took it then you say my temper won't
[1:28:45] let me do it
[1:28:49] if you've got his spirit it's conquered
[1:28:54] when he's riled upon he riled not back
[1:28:57] when he's made a fun of he held his
[1:28:59] peace
[1:29:00] when he's called a devil he held his
[1:29:02] peace
[1:29:03] he had one business
[1:29:04] that's the father's business
[1:29:08] and he went about doing that and finally
[1:29:09] they took him to a cross death had to
[1:29:12] face him
[1:29:13] all the rest of them had conquered seas
[1:29:15] they'd conquered nature they'd conquered
[1:29:17] lines they'd conquered fire they'd
[1:29:19] conquered everything but death and
[1:29:20] here's one beaten in his brain his veins
[1:29:23] and had conquered had his blood that was
[1:29:25] beaten through there had the conquering
[1:29:27] power of death so they took his hands
[1:29:29] stretched him out nailed him to a cross
[1:29:31] they beat him they stripped him till his
[1:29:33] bones stare at him and when he did and
[1:29:35] they'd done all they could do death
[1:29:37] struck him said now i'll take you like i
[1:29:39] did joshua i'll take you like i did
[1:29:41] daniel i'll do all this because i'm
[1:29:43] going to make you die and he died to the
[1:29:45] son said he was dead nature said he was
[1:29:47] dead and it all testified he was dead
[1:29:50] and brother but then the devil sent his
[1:29:52] precious soul to the bottomless pits of
[1:29:54] hell and there the gates opened
[1:29:57] and when he come out on the third day he
[1:30:00] conquered the gate of death hell in the
[1:30:02] grave
[1:30:04] oh hallelujah and his seed shall possess
[1:30:06] the gate of the enemy conquered death
[1:30:08] conquered hell and on easter morning he
[1:30:11] conquered the grave and now we stand
[1:30:13] with him more than conquerors
[1:30:17] oh hallelujah and on the day of
[1:30:19] pentecost he sent down the holy ghost to
[1:30:21] continue through the gentiles to conquer
[1:30:24] gates and we don't have to conquer no
[1:30:26] more because it's already been conquered
[1:30:29] hallelujah sickness is already conquered
[1:30:32] death is already conquered temptation is
[1:30:34] already conquered all devils is already
[1:30:37] conquered hell is conquered the grave is
[1:30:40] conquered and we're standing at the

[1:34:53] to conquer every gate he said you will
[1:34:55] possess every gate
[1:34:59] if you've got an enemy this morning if
[1:35:01] you're a seat of abraham there's not
[1:35:03] enough devils in hell that can keep that
[1:35:05] gate before you

[1:35:10] walk up there as a promisee and said i
[1:35:12] claim this for mine this is mine because

[1:35:30] the enemy will have to recognize that
[1:35:34] and move back
[1:35:36] amen we can read in matthew 16 and verse
[1:35:38] 16
[1:35:39] simon peter answered and said thou art
[1:35:42] the christ here jesus brought him to a
[1:35:44] moment
[1:35:46] some they were saying well some says
[1:35:47] you're elias
[1:35:49] some says you're one of the prophets he
[1:35:50] said well that's okay but what do you
[1:35:51] say
[1:35:53] what are you going to say
[1:35:54] do you hear it what are you going to say
[1:35:58] how are you going to respond
[1:36:00] simon peter answered and said thou art
[1:36:01] the christ the son of the living god and
[1:36:04] jesus answered said unto him blessed art
[1:36:06] thou simon barjona for flesh and blood
[1:36:09] is not revealed unto thee this unto thee
[1:36:12] but for my father which is in heaven and
[1:36:14] i say unto thee that thou art rev peter
[1:36:17] and upon this rock will i build my
[1:36:19] church and the gates of hell shall not
[1:36:22] prevail against it and i will give unto
[1:36:24] thee the keys of the kingdom and
[1:36:26] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[1:36:27] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:36:30] thou loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:36:31] heaven what does this the revelation
[1:36:36] amen a personal revelation of who he is
[1:36:39] amen brother brown said you know the
[1:36:41] catholics thought that was peter so they
[1:36:42] built on peter he said it wasn't on
[1:36:44] peter
[1:36:45] it wasn't upon that upon that rock but
[1:36:48] the rock of revelation
[1:36:51] and in this revelation when you he said
[1:36:53] brother brown would pick it up in the
[1:36:54] church age book amen the importance of
[1:36:56] revelation by the spirit of a true
[1:36:58] believer can never be over emphasized
[1:37:01] revelation means more to you than
[1:37:03] perhaps you realize and this is where
[1:37:06] abraham was walking by revelation
[1:37:09] because god had given the promise and he
[1:37:12] was walking in the revelation of the
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:18] promise this is where it was
[1:37:22] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:37:24] against it
[1:37:25] when god has personally revealed to you
[1:37:29] because as he said flesh and blood
[1:37:31] didn't give you this peter
[1:37:34] it's a personal revelation
[1:37:40] it's just like the the lineage of the
[1:37:42] priest
[1:37:44] in the in the under the law it was by
[1:37:46] birth they were priests
[1:37:49] but in this covenant is by revelation
[1:37:51] their priest
[1:37:53] so we're not we don't come by birth as
[1:37:55] far as humanly speaking
[1:37:58] you know as much as i want to i can't
[1:38:00] pass it down to my children they have to
[1:38:02] have their revelation
[1:38:04] sure i can teach them i can try to
[1:38:06] instruct them but they have to come to
[1:38:08] the moment
[1:38:09] this god is my god
[1:38:14] you remember that moment
[1:38:18] brother lemuel come out of that little
[1:38:19] room up there in oklahoma and said i
[1:38:21] want the hole to go well he said i want
[1:38:22] to be baptized
[1:38:24] i said well what are you going to be
[1:38:25] baptized for brother let me know he said
[1:38:27] i want the holy ghost
[1:38:29] i gotta have it i can't leave without it
[1:38:30] i want it and you could see the
[1:38:32] desperation in his heart
[1:38:34] and i said well brother let me know you
[1:38:35] don't have to be baptized to receive the
[1:38:36] holy ghost you can get the holy ghost
[1:38:38] and then be baptized
[1:38:40] and i said but what you want is that god
[1:38:42] not to be just your dad is god or your
[1:38:44] mama's god or the preacher's god you
[1:38:47] want that god to be your god
[1:38:49] laid hands on him and he became
[1:38:51] instantly drunk
[1:38:53] in the spirit for hours
[1:38:55] up into the morning as he begin to
[1:38:57] realize this god who's screaming out
[1:38:59] it's my god
[1:39:02] it became a personal revelation
[1:39:05] it became a personal revelation amen
[1:39:08] it's almost even almost in the realms of
[1:39:10] even becoming a minister it couldn't be
[1:39:12] handed to me from my father
[1:39:14] he might have wanted me to be a preacher
[1:39:16] he might have desired that for his son
[1:39:18] just like i would for my son but we
[1:39:20] can't do that
[1:39:21] it's not handed down generation to
[1:39:23] generation it's god-given
[1:39:27] and the holy ghost is god-given
[1:39:30] but it's a promise it's in the account
[1:39:34] they don't care what the devil says it
[1:39:36] doesn't matter if the devil says he
[1:39:37] ain't doing it no more it's still there
[1:39:47] revelation
[1:39:52] it's wonderful we know how he ends up
[1:39:55] as it brings down he says when the
[1:39:56] church
[1:39:57] disbelieves satan
[1:39:59] and believes the spirit's revelation of
[1:40:02] the word
[1:40:03] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:40:05] her
[1:40:07] he said let it let me put a word here
[1:40:08] from my own ministry if you don't mind
[1:40:10] you all know this gift in my life is
[1:40:11] supernatural see it wasn't man given it
[1:40:14] was god-given
[1:40:18] it's a gift whereby the holy spirit is
[1:40:20] able to discern diseases and thoughts of
[1:40:21] men's heart and other hidden things
[1:40:24] that only god can know and then reveal
[1:40:26] to me he says i wish you could stand
[1:40:27] with me see the faces of people when
[1:40:29] satan know he's going to be exposed
[1:40:32] isn't that the people i'm talking about
[1:40:35] isn't that satan that's got a holding
[1:40:36] their lives through sin and indifference
[1:40:38] and diseases but you should see their
[1:40:40] faces satan knows he's going to be
[1:40:42] exposed and the most peculiar change
[1:40:44] comes over over the people's countenance
[1:40:47] i've seen those satan is afraid he knows
[1:40:50] that the spirit of god is about to let
[1:40:53] the people know of his works
[1:40:56] and he's about to lose power over the
[1:40:58] gate
[1:41:00] that is why he hates these meetings so
[1:41:02] much when names are caused and disease
[1:41:04] is revealed satan hates that what is it
[1:41:07] it's not mind reading is not telepathy
[1:41:09] nor is it witchcraft it's a revelation
[1:41:11] by the holy ghost
[1:41:13] that it can only what that's the only
[1:41:14] way i can know it of course the carnal
[1:41:16] mind will call it anything but the holy
[1:41:18] ghost but let me show you another reason
[1:41:20] why satan hates the book of revelation
[1:41:22] and jesus christ in the church he knows
[1:41:25] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:41:28] today forever and he changes not he
[1:41:31] knows more a lot more than most 90
[1:41:33] percent of theologians know he knows
[1:41:36] that since god is immutable in his
[1:41:38] nature he's also immutable in his ways
[1:41:40] thus satan knows assurely that the
[1:41:43] original church at pentecost with the
[1:41:45] power of god
[1:41:47] mark 16 in action is the true church
[1:41:50] that jesus claims is his own all else
[1:41:54] is false
[1:41:56] all else is false it has to be now
[1:41:59] remember this christ in the true church
[1:42:02] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:42:05] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:42:07] that antichrist spirit would come into
[1:42:09] the church defile it make it lukewarm
[1:42:12] formal and powerless it exposes satan
[1:42:14] revealing his works attempting the
[1:42:16] destruction of god's people and the
[1:42:18] discrediting of god's word right down to
[1:42:20] the time he's cast in the lake of fire
[1:42:22] he fights that do you blame him
[1:42:25] he fights that he can't stand it he
[1:42:27] knows
[1:42:29] let's talk about what the devil knows
[1:42:32] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:42:35] revelation of the true church and what
[1:42:37] she is and what she stands for and that
[1:42:40] she can do the greater works
[1:42:45] mark 16 in action she will be an
[1:42:48] invincible army
[1:42:52] hallelujah she will be the possessor of
[1:42:55] the gates
[1:42:59] hey man there was an enemy one time
[1:43:01] thought they had a child of god locked
[1:43:03] inside of a city one time and he walked
[1:43:05] to the gate and realized it was locked
[1:43:07] but what happened he began to feel those
[1:43:09] locks that was down his hair he knew he
[1:43:11] was a man under a covenant
[1:43:14] he knew he was a man under a promise and
[1:43:16] the anointing began to fall upon that
[1:43:18] body little shrimp looking thing and he
[1:43:21] began to feel the power of god moving in
[1:43:23] him until he had such a surge he grabbed
[1:43:26] those gates and he picked them up and he
[1:43:28] put them on his back and he hauled him
[1:43:29] to the top of the hill
[1:43:32] oh hallelujah amen maybe the devil
[1:43:35] tonight has got some child him there but
[1:43:38] i asked that you would begin to realize
[1:43:40] i am a child under a covenant i am under
[1:43:43] the covenant of the same covenant
[1:43:45] abraham was under i'm under the same
[1:43:48] blessing abraham was under i'm under the
[1:43:50] same word abraham was under i'm under
[1:43:53] and when you'll feel that surge of the
[1:43:55] holy ghost you'll walk to that gate of
[1:43:57] pride you'll walk that gate of arrogance
[1:43:59] you'll walk to that gate of share and
[1:44:01] you'll pick it up and you'll throw it
[1:44:03] out of the way and say my god has
[1:44:06] conquered every game and i am now a
[1:44:08] possessor of the kingdom of god
[1:44:12] i'm a possessor of all things
[1:44:20] she
[1:44:21] will be an invincible army
[1:44:25] if they get a true revelation
[1:44:27] of the two spirits within the framework
[1:44:29] of the christian church
[1:44:31] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:44:34] withstand that antichrist spirit
[1:44:36] satan
[1:44:38] will be powerless
[1:44:41] before her
[1:44:42] he will be as definitely thwarted today
[1:44:45] as when christ was stood every effort to
[1:44:48] gain power over him in the desert yes
[1:44:51] satan hates revelation
[1:44:54] but we love it
[1:44:56] for with true revelation in our lives
[1:44:59] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:45:01] us
[1:45:02] but we will prevail over them
[1:45:07] let's stand to our feet
[1:45:28] what are you gonna say
[1:45:32] in your trial and in your test
[1:45:37] what's going to be your response
[1:45:39] abraham had plenty of time to walk away
[1:45:42] but he wouldn't have been the possessor
[1:45:45] he if he would have walked away
[1:45:48] he had to get to the point of having
[1:45:50] that knife in his hand
[1:45:52] before he could really fully see
[1:45:55] his jehovah jairo
[1:45:59] sometimes god will let you walk down to
[1:46:00] your last step
[1:46:03] for you to realize
[1:46:05] he's jehovah jireh
[1:46:07] he's more than enough
[1:46:09] any situation
[1:46:11] let's buy our heads
[1:46:22] why don't you look at your account
[1:46:23] tonight

[1:46:31] cardinal federal whatever bank you bank
[1:46:33] at
[1:46:35] that has no eternal value
