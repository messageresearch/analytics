[0:08] There is no place where you're not
[0:11] there. I'll never drift from your love
[0:15] and care. There's not a thing about me
[0:20] that you don't know.
[0:25] The wings of the morning will take me to
[0:28] you. the blackness of night. Your love
[0:32] will shine through. You're already
[0:35] there. No matter where I may go,
[0:41] [Music]
[0:42] even before
[0:44] I came to be, your loving eyes were
[0:49] looking at me. You're even closer than
[0:53] the very breath that I take.
[0:59] Mother and father, more than a friend to
[1:03] me, beginning and ending, and living a
[1:07] life to me. The song I find myself
[1:10] singing when I awake.
[1:14] [Music]
[1:16] Oh, I
[1:20] will praise you,
[1:25] Lord.
[1:29] I praise you
[1:34] now.
[1:38] I praise you
[1:42] for bearing me up and giving me wings.
[1:46] For lifting my sight to heavenly things.
[1:50] For being a song I can't help but sing.
[1:56] Praise you.
[1:59] [Music]
[2:01] Look at me, Lord. I'm open to you.
[2:05] do anything that you want to do. Cuz you
[2:10] know me better than I know myself.
[2:15] [Music]
[2:18] I'll not be afraid of what you can see.
[2:22] Cuz you know the
[2:24] inside of me. Don't even try to hide
[2:29] when you know so well.
[2:33] [Music]
[2:35] Now be patient with my mistakes. I want
[2:39] to be yours. Whatever it takes. I
[2:43] learned that life without you is no life
[2:48] at all.
[2:52] Failures and talents and teams I bring
[2:55] to you. Aspirations
[2:58] and dreams I sing to you. I'll just be
[3:01] here ready whenever you hold.
[3:08] Oh, I
[3:12] will praise you,
[3:17] Lord.
[3:21] I praise you
[3:25] now.
[3:29] I praise you
[3:33] for bearing me up and giving me wings.
[3:37] For lifting my sigh to heavenly things.
[3:42] For being a song I can't help but sing.
[3:47] Praise you.
[3:51] So I
[3:56] will praise you. You
[4:05] praise you
[4:07] [Music]
[4:09] now.
[4:13] I praise you.
[4:17] For bearing me up and giving me wings.
[4:21] For lifting my eyes to heavenly things.
[4:25] for being a song I can't help but sing.
[4:31] Praise you.
