[42:36] of the day by time tested materials
[42:40] those who take God at his word no matter
[42:43] what the symptoms are what the
[42:45] circumstances are that never stands in
[42:48] their way amen we're time tested amen
[42:52] children of God I I believe we come from
[42:55] a great heritage a great l of of Faith
[42:58] amen we can read through Hebrews chap 11
[43:01] about the faith of all the ones of our
[43:03] forefathers who by faith Abraham by
[43:06] faith Sarah amen but God just didn't
[43:08] finish there in Hebrews chapter 11 but
[43:11] he said let us seeing we're so compassed
[43:14] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[43:17] let us run the race that is set before
[43:19] us now we know every Church ages run
[43:21] their race and here we are amen right
[43:24] down to our La our final our final place
[43:27] and and it's the final leg and it's the
[43:29] final time and we're the final Runners
[43:32] but I believe God has put his best in
[43:34] this age amen that's what you do you
[43:37] know you put your best in a race in a in
[43:39] a relay race you actually put your best
[43:41] in the front and you put your best at
[43:43] the last and that's what God did he came
[43:46] and he gave his best he gave the holy
[43:48] spirit amen to the first age and he came
[43:51] back around and gave it to again in the
[43:53] same power to the last stage amen so we
[43:56] can also run as they ran we could also
[43:59] have faith as they had faith we could
[44:01] also have power as they have power we
[44:04] can also amen see Miracles and signs and
[44:07] wonders as they have seen miracles signs
[44:09] and wonders amen and I'm thankful as we
[44:12] read in this scripture he knows the way
[44:14] that I take there's nothing that we
[44:16] could ever go through that he doesn't
[44:17] know already or catches him by surprise
[44:20] or or he's shocked by anything that we
[44:22] go through but he knows where we going
[44:25] how we're going to go through and he
[44:27] when he has tried me we're going to come
[44:29] forth as gold or come forth as something
[44:32] that is precious in His sight amen you
[44:35] know we can read there in 1 Peter 1 and
[44:37] verse3 it said blessed be the God and
[44:39] father of our Lord Jesus Christ which
[44:41] according to His abundant Mercy has
[44:44] begotten us according unto the Lively
[44:46] Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[44:48] from the dead to an inheritance
[44:51] Incorruptible and undefiled and that
[44:53] fadeth not away reserved in heaven for
[44:56] you who are kept by the power of God
[45:00] Amen that's who keeping that's who is
[45:01] keeping us tonight we're not here
[45:03] because we have in Incredible strength
[45:06] or incredible Stam stamina or incredible
[45:08] abilities we are kept by the power of
[45:11] God through faith under salvation ready
[45:14] to be revealed in the last time wherein
[45:16] ye greatly Rejoice though now for a
[45:19] season if need be your in heaviness
[45:21] through manifold temptations that the
[45:24] trial of your faith being much more
[45:27] precious than that of gold that perishes
[45:29] though it be Tried by fire might be
[45:32] found in the praise and honor and Glory
[45:34] at the appearing of Jesus Christ so it's
[45:37] not that we're just going to have faith
[45:38] but our faith is going to be tried amen
[45:41] we're going to go through tests we're
[45:42] going to go through trials we're going
[45:44] to go through hardships and I know every
[45:45] one of us no doubt some of us are in one
[45:48] right now or we're about ready to go
[45:49] into another because life is a series of
[45:52] Trials life is a series of tests it's
[45:54] not a we're not in a time that we can
[45:56] take take our armor off and we can lay
[45:58] it aside and put our Shield aside and
[46:00] our sword aside no that's over in the
[46:02] Millennium that's coming but until then
[46:05] amen we're going to go through tests
[46:07] we're going to have trials we're going
[46:08] to go through problems and situations in
[46:10] our lives and God is going to allow
[46:13] those things to come to see how you will
[46:15] react to them amen you know he said in
[46:18] other place he said When Trials come and
[46:20] the church gets All Shook Up he said
[46:22] it's so easy for a Congregation of
[46:24] people to do that when something don't
[46:26] don't just seem to happen the way it's
[46:28] supposed to be but God makes it that
[46:31] way amen God makes it that way God
[46:35] brings tensions into the church for
[46:38] every son that cometh to God must be
[46:40] tried and proven and tested he lets
[46:43] sicknesses strike you he lets diseases
[46:46] come upon you why to test you and to
[46:49] prove you who you are to show the world
[46:52] that you are truly the Seed of
[46:54] Abraham that if Abraham believed and I'm
[46:57] a Seed of Abraham then I also will
[47:00] believe if Abraham was steadfast and I'm
[47:03] a Seed of Abraham I will also remain
[47:06] steadfast If Abraham endured to the
[47:09] promised son amen and I am a Abraham's
[47:11] seed then I will also endure as Abraham
[47:15] endured amen see he permits it by his
[47:18] own will he permits disasters he permits
[47:21] friends to turn against you he permits
[47:23] all of these things he'll turn the devil
[47:25] loose on you to tempt you he will do all
[47:28] that but take your life he could throw
[47:30] you in a bed of Affliction he can turn
[47:32] your neighbors against you he can turn
[47:34] the church against you he can do almost
[47:36] anything if it's God's will for him to
[47:39] do it that's the key right there if it's
[47:42] God's will for him to do it Satan cannot
[47:45] operate outside of God's
[47:47] will amen so if sickness is upon you
[47:51] then God has allowed it to be thus if
[47:53] you're in a trial then God has allowed
[47:55] it to be thus if you're facing
[47:57] difficulties then God has allowed it to
[48:00] be that amen Satan doesn't operate on
[48:03] his own he's not his own man amen but as
[48:05] brother brand would say he said God puts
[48:07] bits in trouble's mouth amen God put has
[48:11] him in control he's in in God's control
[48:13] amen he said what about Abraham with
[48:15] Isaac on the mountain the one promise
[48:17] that was given and by his loyalty and
[48:20] his knowing and his faith in Jehovah it
[48:23] it's through that and that alone that
[48:25] God looked down and said is
[48:27] shall possess the gates I've sworn by
[48:29] myself and I'll will do these things
[48:31] because he could swear by no greater
[48:33] then if he let Abraham be tested to that
[48:36] final point he will test you and me to
[48:39] that final
[48:41] moment Hallelujah that time of decision
[48:45] when everything is away from you and you
[48:47] have to stand
[48:49] alone yes come on now amen maybe this
[48:53] wasn't what you was expecting tonight
[48:55] but this is what you're getting tonight
[48:57] amen because we come to these places in
[48:59] our lives and God allows you to get to a
[49:02] place that you have to stand
[49:05] alone oh it's easy to stand at a youth
[49:07] camp it's easy to stand in a certain
[49:09] atmosphere it's easy to stand when
[49:11] everybody's shouting and dancing and
[49:13] carrying on but when you're by
[49:15] yourself when you're in the Valley of
[49:17] the shadow of death when you're in the
[49:19] moments that you're being tested till
[49:21] you think you can't hardly hold it
[49:23] anymore God is allowing you to be tested
[49:26] to your your final
[49:28] [Applause]
[49:30] point you have to stand alone stand
[49:32] alone you walk out there and say though
[49:35] God slay me I'll trust
[49:37] him amen that's the Seed of Abraham
[49:41] that's the one that gives the promise no
[49:43] matter what the rest of them say or the
[49:45] rest of them do for me in my
[49:49] house we're going to serve the Lord amen

[54:10] this that way if I'm going through the
[54:12] hardest time of my life and and I don't
[54:14] know which way is up and which way is
[54:16] down am mean you know some people get
[54:18] that way and clouds Pilots new ones

[54:21] their instruments and not been trained
[54:23] very much in some of those things you
[54:25] can get in clouds and you can lose
[54:27] yourself you don't know if you're up or
[54:28] you're down or you're sideways that's
[54:30] what causes a lot of wrecks and this is
[54:32] what happens to people because they get
[54:34] into a cloudy moment and they get into a
[54:36] moment of discouragement or moment of
[54:38] depression and they're not used to their
[54:42] instruments Amen to their GPS system and
[54:46] and where their guidance system and
[54:47] they're they're not depending on that

[54:50] out and they don't realize they're going
[54:52] for a crash they're going down and not
[54:55] going up amen but if you will begin to
[54:56] realize God is in control whether I'm on
[54:59] the ground whether I'm in the sky

[55:03] the Stars wherever I am God is is still
[55:08] God Amen so your faith has to stay there
[55:12] it cannot waver from that moment from
[55:14] that
[55:15] place he would say in one place he said
[55:18] if we could all get to a and I love this
[55:20] quote and I don't have it but I just
[55:22] keeps coming to my mind about about the
[55:24] sending station receiving station but he
[55:26] says if we could all tune our hearts
[55:28] today Amen to just this one thought
[55:30] these three words God is
[55:34] God he said what kind of service could
[55:37] we
[55:38] have not God is God
[55:41] yesterday or God is God tomorrow or God
[55:45] is God next week no God is
[55:48] God then if he is God he's God over
[55:51] every sickness he's God over every trial

[56:00] circumstance he's
[56:05] God if you met his requirements and
[56:07] you've and you've and you've asked God
[56:10] for if you had something in your heart
[56:11] and you you know you ask God to forgive
[56:13] you and you've met the requirements of
[56:15] his word then he's obligated to bring
[56:17] his word to pass right amen don't back
[56:21] off from it well and said well I I never
[56:23] got I never got I never got healed he
[56:25] said oh you poor weak
[56:27] Faith you poor weak Faith don't believe
[56:29] that if everything's confessed and
[56:32] everything's out and you met God's
[56:34] requirement faith will hold there's
[56:36] nothing will move it he he is and you're
[56:38] sure they that wait upon the Lord shall
[56:41] renew their strength amen they shall
[56:43] Mount up with the wings of an eagle they
[56:45] shall run and not be weary if they walk
[56:47] they shall not faint wait when you meet
[56:50] his requirements that brings your faith
[56:52] to a showdown God's requirements have
[56:55] been met and you ful fully considered it
[56:57] you've done everything that God's
[56:58] required then your faith rests right
[57:01] here that he is
[57:04] God but you know he loves to test
[57:09] us come on anybody been tested this
[57:14] week you know why he loves to test you
[57:16] because he loves to see the reaction of
[57:19] your
[57:22] faith that when it seems impossible you
[57:26] still
[57:28] believe when it seems like there's no
[57:30] way across the Red Sea you still believe
[57:33] when it seems like those walls are too
[57:35] high and those Giants are too big you
[57:37] still believe when it seems like there's
[57:40] no way there's no cure there's no answer
[57:43] there's no there's no peace there's no
[57:45] there's no happiness there's no joy you
[57:47] still
[57:51] believe God likes to see how you'll
[57:54] react
[57:57] when you say oh Lord I believe you thou
[57:59] My Savior I believe that You're My
[58:00] Healer I believe that you're the one
[58:01] that gives the Holy Spirit the things
[58:03] that I'm requiring you are the god that
[58:05] gives that and then you confess all your
[58:07] sin and promise God what you'll do amen
[58:09] then because it don't happen you run off
[58:11] like a coward somewhere God can't use
[58:14] that there's no way for him to use it
[58:16] there's no way for him to answer you cuz
[58:18] he only Answers by faith and then all of
[58:20] a sudden you go away and he can't
[58:23] answer when I return shall I find Faith
[58:28] but he comes to return and there's no
[58:30] faith he finds a helpless spineless no
[58:33] good for nothing individual has done
[58:36] give up on God and give up on everything
[58:38] and right there your answer was almost
[58:40] to
[58:41] you if You' have just waited a little
[58:44] longer sometimes well I don't like
[58:47] waiting well that's your problem get
[58:48] used to it I know we live in a a society
[58:52] we don't like waiting my God we don't
[58:54] like waiting 5 minutes for breakfast
[58:56] where or 5 minutes for a coffee
[58:59] right are y'all are y'all here tonight
[59:01] or where y'all at am me we we don't like
[59:04] it we don't I that ain't me you lying
[59:06] hound dog you throwed up enough fuss you
[59:09] carried on enough about having a way I
[59:11] can't believe it's taking this long amen
[59:13] we turn that same attitude towards God
[59:16] and we want it right now we want it
[59:18] right now it's got to happen this time
[59:20] it's got to happen in this moment listen
[59:22] it's not on your time it's on God's time
[59:30] he said the vision May T but it will
[59:33] come to
[59:34] pass amen we if it was on our time the
[59:37] Rapture would have happened a long time
[59:40] ago hello somebody if the Rapture was on
[59:43] a human's determination it would have
[59:45] happened a long time
[59:48] ago if it would happened in 2000 on
[59:51] somebody's wh and said I believe 2000 is
[59:54] a good year for God to come back how how
[59:56] many would be here right
[59:57] now come on lift your hands if you'd
[59:59] have been here or maybe it Go the
[1:00:01] opposite way who wouldn't be here right
[1:00:06] now aren't you glad it wasn't dependent
[1:00:08] on a human
[1:00:10] thought but God had something else in
[1:00:12] his mind that's it he had more in his
[1:00:15] mind than what I had or maybe you had or
[1:00:19] preacher had amen he has more in his
[1:00:21] mind so he delays his coming he allows
[1:00:23] it cuz he's a god rich in Mercy
[1:00:27] you know what it is he has some tabl set
[1:00:29] and he's got some plates set there and
[1:00:31] not one of them is going to be an empty
[1:00:34] seat and if he has to wait till the last
[1:00:37] moment he'll
[1:00:39] wait that's right but it's us it gets
[1:00:42] impatient like man my goodness why
[1:00:44] couldn't we get out of here a long time
[1:00:46] ago yes I would love to be out here a
[1:00:47] long time ago but there would be a lot
[1:00:49] of people that sitting here tonight
[1:00:51] wouldn't be
[1:00:52] here but God rich in Mercy
[1:00:56] Hallelujah he didn't leave it up to a
[1:00:58] Fickle human
[1:01:01] being come on he I'll drag y'all all the
[1:01:05] way through this service if I have to he
[1:01:07] didn't leave it up to a Fickle human
[1:01:10] being he didn't leave it up to me he
[1:01:13] didn't leave it up to brother Tim he
[1:01:14] didn't even leave it up to a prophet but
[1:01:16] God's got something in his mind he's got
[1:01:19] a certain time in a certain day it's
[1:01:21] going to happen it's going to be
[1:01:24] fulfilled it may not be on my time but
[1:01:27] when God moves he
[1:01:30] moves come on somebody you might have
[1:01:33] been waiting a long time and it seemed
[1:01:34] like it's impossible and it's passed and
[1:01:37] there's no way it can happen but when
[1:01:39] God moves that's right he moves when God
[1:01:42] moves on a heart he moves on a heart
[1:01:45] when God changes he changes things amen
[1:01:48] God can do what he wants to do when he
[1:01:50] wants to do
[1:01:52] it he's
[1:01:54] God on
[1:01:59] yeah think of the Hebrew
[1:02:02] children here they was to their last
[1:02:05] moments but why did they get to that
[1:02:07] last moment cuz God had confidence in
[1:02:11] them
[1:02:17] yes some of us we don't want God to have
[1:02:20] confidence in
[1:02:23] US honestly I mean who wants to have the
[1:02:26] confidence God must have in Ron
[1:02:29] Spencer God's Got
[1:02:33] Confidence he's a confident
[1:02:36] God he's got confidence in this service
[1:02:39] this
[1:02:40] evening cuz he's a confident God he
[1:02:44] knows there's hearts that need to be
[1:02:45] changed he knows there's people that
[1:02:46] need to be healed he's a confident God
[1:02:49] and sometimes he'll allow you to get to
[1:02:51] your last
[1:02:53] step your last moment
[1:02:56] and then he will
[1:02:58] move amen they knew he was Jehovah they
[1:03:01] knew he answered prayer they they had
[1:03:03] heard about all the things whether he
[1:03:05] would in their case or not it didn't
[1:03:07] matter cuz they still knew he was
[1:03:11] God so when they were going to the fiery
[1:03:13] furnace knowing they were certain of God
[1:03:15] Amen if that they would they were
[1:03:17] certain that if God burned them up he
[1:03:19] would raise them up they were certain
[1:03:22] because they knew that God would work
[1:03:24] anything for their good and when we're
[1:03:26] certain of God we know that God works
[1:03:28] everything for our
[1:03:30] good everything for our good so they

[1:10:33] and they they'll start telling you all
[1:10:34] their problems and they don't talk
[1:10:36] themselves out of the healing before you
[1:10:37] even had one chance I've seen it happen
[1:10:40] too many times they start expressing
[1:10:42] their
[1:10:43] doubts well I just don't see how this is
[1:10:46] going to work and I don't see how this
[1:10:47] is going to be well why are we coming
[1:10:51] up amen then they come up service after
[1:10:53] service after service over the the same
[1:10:55] thing the same thing and the same thing

[1:11:00] react it ain't all about a preacher's
[1:11:02] Faith it's about your faith we can have
[1:11:05] all the faith in the world but if you
[1:11:06] ain't got a lick of faith God can't do
[1:11:08] nothing for you amen it takes your faith
[1:11:12] Amen to rise up to the
[1:11:14] occasion to say this is my moment this
[1:11:18] is my service this is my time this is my

[1:11:26] right
[1:11:32] yes said through
[1:11:35] circumstances may fall off from the
[1:11:37] right to the left but Faith doesn't move
[1:11:41] because you're certain he's God see this
[1:11:44] is where Faith's resting place it's in
[1:11:46] his
[1:11:47] word and the only way you can have faith
[1:11:49] in his word you got to believe he's God
[1:11:51] cuz if he's God then his word doesn't
[1:11:53] fail that's right
[1:11:55] amen so no matter what happened around
[1:11:58] you that has nothing to do with his
[1:12:01] word you understand yeah circumstances
[1:12:04] has nothing to do with his word
[1:12:07] sicknesses has nothing to do with what
[1:12:09] his word says situations around you does
[1:12:12] not dictate whether his word is good or
[1:12:14] word is not good his word is his word
[1:12:17] and God is God therefore we can rest in

[1:13:20] you laid your hands upon the Altar and
[1:13:23] and become one with your sacrifice and
[1:13:25] if you have then it ain't about your
[1:13:27] faults and your failures it's about your

[1:14:07] requirements these signs shall follow
[1:14:09] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:14:11] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[1:14:14] new tongues if they take up serpents or
[1:14:15] dead drink deadly things it shall not

[1:14:45] preacher you're no better than you was
[1:14:47] when them preachers prayed for you how
[1:14:50] them preachers ain't right in the first
[1:14:52] place direct quote it does doesn't
[1:14:55] matter about that
[1:14:57] preacher hello it doesn't matter about
[1:15:00] that preacher it's your faith in the
[1:15:03] Living God that
[1:15:05] counts it's not what the preacher is
[1:15:07] it's what God is the preacher never made
[1:15:10] the promise God made the promise it's
[1:15:14] not up to the preacher it's up to God
[1:15:17] and your
[1:15:21] faith like we we've mentioned before
[1:15:23] about the man that was laying at that
[1:15:25] well and the angel of the Lord would
[1:15:27] come through and stir the waters I know
[1:15:30] they want to make it a bunch of hoopla
[1:15:31] today and say it wasn't so but I I just
[1:15:33] take what a prophet said he said ever so
[1:15:35] often the angel would come and stir the
[1:15:37] waters people got healed I can tell you
[1:15:40] that guy wasn't laying there for 38
[1:15:42] years over some
[1:15:43] hoopla he had to have seen somebody get
[1:15:46] healed amen but here he is in this
[1:15:49] condition and Jesus comes ask him a
[1:15:51] question do you want to get well well
[1:15:54] that's a weird question ain't it I mean
[1:15:56] he's sick he's laid there for 38 years
[1:15:58] what do you mean do I want to get well
[1:15:59] but see Jesus knew down on the inside of
[1:16:01] him it was more than just that question
[1:16:04] there was excuses laying behind that
[1:16:06] well I ain't got nobody to take me to
[1:16:08] the water I I ain't got a certain
[1:16:10] preacher to pray for me or say something
[1:16:12] over oh I I a I ain't got to I got to be
[1:16:14] Anointed with all five times I got to do
[1:16:17] he had all kinds of excuses but Jesus
[1:16:19] wanted to just know do you want to get
[1:16:22] well and this is what his word is saying
[1:16:25] in this hour do you want to be healed do
[1:16:26] you want to be delivered do you want to
[1:16:28] be set free do you want God to move on
[1:16:30] your
[1:16:31] behalf then away with the
[1:16:34] excuses just accept what God Said and go
[1:16:37] forward with your faith and that what he
[1:16:39] said that he will bring it to pass
[1:16:43] that's right it's up to him if you
[1:16:49] believe but see God does this he tests
[1:16:53] you God permits you sometimes to get a
[1:16:56] little worse after you're prayed
[1:17:01] for just to test you yes the testings
[1:17:06] and trials of Faith but it's he that
[1:17:08] endureth there it is hold on take God at
[1:17:11] his word believe every word of it no
[1:17:14] matter how what anything else does or
[1:17:17] anybody else does believe it anyhow no
[1:17:19] matter what the circumstances look like
[1:17:21] believe God
[1:17:23] anyhow those discouragement in times
[1:17:25] come to every believer to test you and
[1:17:28] to try you I'm going to quote after
[1:17:30] quote to see if you really do
[1:17:33] believe discouraging times comes to
[1:17:36] every believer to test to try to see if
[1:17:39] you really do
[1:17:42] believe every son that cometh to God
[1:17:44] must be first tested and child trained
[1:17:46] there will be some of you here tonight
[1:17:48] no doubt we'll go through that same test
[1:17:50] if we should call a prayer line I have
[1:17:52] no idea who's got cards prayer cards no
[1:17:54] one else knows they're just all shuffled
[1:17:56] up together and handed you I'll call it
[1:17:58] from somewhere whatever is on my mind at
[1:18:00] the time we can't stand but a few at a
[1:18:02] time anyhow couple dozen maybe we'll
[1:18:04] pass over all will want to come and you
[1:18:08] may think listen to this you may think
[1:18:10] that he has passed you
[1:18:12] by but he hasn't
[1:18:17] amen why why would they think that
[1:18:19] because they didn't get to come in front
[1:18:21] of the Prophet maybe they didn't get
[1:18:24] their car pulled they didn't get it
[1:18:26] called maybe they didn't have their
[1:18:28] opportunity to speak to him maybe they
[1:18:30] and they think God has passed you by but
[1:18:32] he
[1:18:35] hasn't I said he hasn't he's just
[1:18:38] testing you just to see if you really
[1:18:40] believe him or
[1:18:43] not come on somebody amen many times we
[1:18:47] think that God's moved on past us amen
[1:18:49] God will walk on just to see if you
[1:18:52] really believe
[1:18:58] he said you notice when you are
[1:18:59] discouraged that's when the devil can
[1:19:01] really pour it on you that's when he can
[1:19:03] get you if you come to church and say
[1:19:06] well I don't know I don't know whether
[1:19:08] I'll get any better or not I I've been
[1:19:10] prayed for twice he said you might as
[1:19:12] well go home that's all but when you can
[1:19:15] cast that
[1:19:17] aside see God doesn't want you to be
[1:19:22] frowning God wants you to be
[1:19:26] happy Hallelujah anyhow good quote
[1:19:29] tonight brother Timothy thank you very
[1:19:31] much God wants you to be happy brother

[1:19:41] face he don't want you to be frowning he
[1:19:44] wants you to be happy a human heart is

[1:20:04] him and nothing can harm you there's
[1:20:07] nothing present nor powers things future
[1:20:10] can separate you from him you are in him
[1:20:13] and he will come and we will never come

[1:21:05] elected me and placed me into this
[1:21:11] place but isn't it
[1:21:13] strange how God does
[1:21:16] things he'll let us get down to the last
[1:21:19] mile of the
[1:21:22] way like you did with the Hebrew
[1:21:24] children he knew who he but you know he
[1:21:27] knew who he could
[1:21:34] trust I'm just going to be very
[1:21:37] open why does sister Karen pass when we
[1:21:41] prayed and we prayed and we prayed
[1:21:43] because he knew who he could
[1:21:48] trust why did Erica pass away cuz he
[1:21:51] knew who he could trust listen God's not
[1:21:54] all about this world we're living

[1:22:01] World if we could only see her

[1:22:09] won Hallelujah if she was here sister
[1:22:11] Karen was here still now even in a good
[1:22:14] body she would be aging getting older
[1:22:16] more aches and pains and everything else
[1:22:18] but she's in a place that she'll never
[1:22:19] get old again she'll never face another
[1:22:23] sickness she'll never face another mind
[1:22:24] battle she'll never face another fear
[1:22:26] another worry or another ringing of her
[1:22:28] hands wondering how this is going to
[1:22:30] work how that's going to be she'll never
[1:22:32] have that again I ask you who really
[1:22:34] won amen sister Erica is not in a body

[1:22:55] that brain bleed lost I tell you who
[1:22:57] loses the devil
[1:22:59] loses hallelujah amen if you could only
[1:23:03] see them now wherefore seeing we're
[1:23:07] incompass by so great a cloud of
[1:23:09] witnesses let us also run our
[1:23:12] race yes sir not with a bunch of loser
[1:23:15] mentality I ain't going to make it I
[1:23:17] can't make it I've already made
[1:23:19] it woo my god I've already made it I've
[1:23:23] already been seen there shouting on the
[1:23:26] Hills of Glory I've already been seen in
[1:23:28] a vision marching Onward Christian
[1:23:30] Soldiers onward to war amen I've already
[1:23:33] been seen
[1:23:38] there but it's so strange how God allows
[1:23:41] us to get to the last mile of the way oh
[1:23:47] you know he likes to do
[1:23:50] that quote he did it with Hebrew
[1:23:54] children he knew who he could trust so
[1:23:56] he let them boys walk right up to the
[1:23:59] fiery furnace till they could smell the
[1:24:01] fire and he never
[1:24:04] moved but when it comes
[1:24:06] time he will
[1:24:09] move he will move but he waits till his
[1:24:12] own time he wanted to see what kind of
[1:24:15] reaction they would have he knew they'd
[1:24:17] made their stand and he knows that you
[1:24:20] make you make when you make your stand
[1:24:22] he'll let Satan take you
[1:24:25] to the last mile of the way but just
[1:24:28] remember he's still
[1:24:31] there he wants to see if you really mean
[1:24:34] what you're talking about oh I believe
[1:24:36] God's A Healer yes I sure believe I I
[1:24:39] believe it next thing you still got pain
[1:24:41] well maybe I never got nothing sure you
[1:24:44] got it he just wanted to see if you're
[1:24:46] going to react on what you
[1:24:49] said come
[1:24:51] on well we just need something that
[1:24:53] would last we got something that'll
[1:24:56] last it's our Fai that our faith that
[1:24:58] Fizzles out but we're also we're also in
[1:25:01] a body of hum humiliation amen you can
[1:25:04] get healed today and get sick
[1:25:10] tomorrow but that don't mean he ain't
[1:25:16] God oh praise the Lord I believe in the
[1:25:18] baptism of the Holy Spirit first little
[1:25:20] Temptation comes along you fly off the
[1:25:22] like a buz saw he's trying to see your
[1:25:25] reaction on your action he's trying to
[1:25:27] test you every son that cometh to God
[1:25:30] must first be chastened and tested every
[1:25:33] child that comes to him he puts him
[1:25:35] through the test to see how he will
[1:25:40] act brother Bram tells a story of a
[1:25:45] builder of bridges there in
[1:25:48] Australia time tested Memorial is a
[1:25:51] wonderful
[1:25:52] sermon but they was trying to find
[1:25:54] somebody that built a bridge to connect
[1:25:57] these cities together and it was a lot
[1:25:59] of sinking sand and shifting Sands and
[1:26:01] quick Sands and they tested and they
[1:26:04] said no we want to undertake it to try
[1:26:06] such a build such a bridge it can't be
[1:26:08] done but this young architect came and
[1:26:11] famous man rep man had a good reputation
[1:26:14] he said oh I like that he said I like a
[1:26:16] man with a reputation oh you don't have
[1:26:18] to be a big man you can be a popper that
[1:26:20] lives in the attic and have a reputation
[1:26:22] far better than a potentate
[1:26:25] you don't have to be rich but you can
[1:26:27] have a reputation it declares your
[1:26:30] reputation what you what you are makes
[1:26:32] you who you are it gives you your
[1:26:34] reputation you're known by your
[1:26:39] reputation that's why we got to make
[1:26:41] sure we got a good
[1:26:43] reputation in business we need a good
[1:26:47] reputation and it don't take much to
[1:26:49] scar it to Mar
[1:26:52] it this man wouldn't down there with
[1:26:55] this wonderful reputation and he looked
[1:26:57] the situation over he walked the banks
[1:26:59] for a few days and he studied it he
[1:27:01] tested it he sounded it looked around
[1:27:04] after a while he said I'll take the job
[1:27:06] they said well sir do you know what
[1:27:07] you're taking he say I thoroughly
[1:27:09] understand well these great Architects
[1:27:11] have already looked at it and turned it
[1:27:12] down he said I'm not afraid of it I'll
[1:27:14] take it I realize I have the worldwide
[1:27:16] reputation as a bridge builder but I'll
[1:27:18] stake my reputation on this
[1:27:21] bridge he had a vision before man can
[1:27:24] make a reputation he has to have a
[1:27:26] vision of what he's doing and blessed be
[1:27:28] the Lord that's the reason there's a
[1:27:30] heaven to go to that's the reason we can
[1:27:33] have a reputation as Christians we know
[1:27:35] what material is in this building the
[1:27:37] blood of Jesus Christ is in this
[1:27:41] building Hallelujah his stained blood
[1:27:44] has washed away all sin he took me from
[1:27:46] the alleys of hell and he's made me a
[1:27:48] servant then I believe and so I passed
[1:27:51] from Death to life and every believer
[1:27:53] has done the same thing because they got
[1:27:55] confidence and they believe in this
[1:27:57] great Builder this great architect the
[1:28:00] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:03] amen when the men did it first thing he
[1:28:06] did to be sure said we got to get a
[1:28:08] solid foundation and so he goes way down
[1:28:10] into the Earth past all the shifting
[1:28:13] Sands until he hit some
[1:28:15] bedrock and he got down that bedrock and
[1:28:18] he anchored those big bolts in there and
[1:28:21] he got around the very best Architects
[1:28:22] he could find the best sign is the best
[1:28:24] equipment and he got the best steel for
[1:28:27] the bridge and he tested every bolt he
[1:28:29] tested every nut he tested every piece
[1:28:32] because this was he was based on his
[1:28:35] reputation on whether it worked or
[1:28:38] whether it
[1:28:41] failed if he went to that much trouble
[1:28:43] to be sure that bridge would be
[1:28:45] safe how much
[1:28:47] trouble do you think God has went to to
[1:28:51] make sure this church would be safe
[1:28:55] amen there's a memorial to the death of
[1:28:58] Jesus Christ this is his church some
[1:29:01] people don't want to live it but some
[1:29:03] will and they will be tested but they
[1:29:06] will
[1:29:07] hold God is testing the people today for
[1:29:11] his
[1:29:14] memorial a lot of times people say oh
[1:29:17] I'm so tempted blessed be the name of
[1:29:18] the Lord for the Temptation when I'm
[1:29:20] weak then I am then he is strong said
[1:29:22] Paul every son that cometh God must
[1:29:24] first be tried and tested these testings
[1:29:26] are more sweeter to you and dear to you
[1:29:28] than precious gold it's testing
[1:29:31] time but he gets down and he places
[1:29:34] every tested piece every tested
[1:29:38] bolt scoffers is that it ain't going to
[1:29:41] hold that ain't that's going to blow up
[1:29:44] that's going to fall in and see that's
[1:29:47] what they're saying
[1:29:48] today they're saying this Holy Ghost
[1:29:51] religion won't last long
[1:29:54] the tree is going to burn down but it
[1:29:57] don't burn
[1:29:59] down it don't burn down he said because
[1:30:03] the fire is actually only gives it water
[1:30:05] it gives New Hope it only strengthens it
[1:30:08] every time the wind hits a tree it
[1:30:09] shoves it back and forth it's loosening
[1:30:11] The Roots every time sickness strikes
[1:30:13] your home every time trial strike your
[1:30:15] life every time neighbors say something
[1:30:17] bad it's only shaking you loosen you up
[1:30:20] so you can get down and get a better
[1:30:22] hold on the Eternal Rock of God
[1:30:25] that's how God does it he sends those
[1:30:27] trials to test you to prove you to shake
[1:30:29] you to give you a new
[1:30:36] hold we find out when they all got done
[1:30:39] the critics said can't work won't
[1:30:43] work
[1:30:45] Architects knew it would hold and he
[1:30:47] knew it would because it been
[1:30:49] tested critics today are saying they
[1:30:51] ain't going to be a bride there ain't
[1:30:54] going to be one without spot without
[1:30:57] wrinkle but God said so and he only said
[1:31:01] it because he had tested what he put in
[1:31:04] this church Hall did you hear me he only
[1:31:08] said that because he'd already tested
[1:31:11] what he put in this church he knew it
[1:31:13] held in
[1:31:15] him when it descended down into his body
[1:31:18] it held him through his temptation yes
[1:31:21] it held him through every trial it h him
[1:31:23] through held him through every time he
[1:31:25] was sick or felt bad it held him through
[1:31:27] every demon oppression it held him
[1:31:29] through every time he got down and
[1:31:33] depressed Hallelujah it held him when he
[1:31:35] got to the moment everybody else walked
[1:31:38] away it held him amen when he was
[1:31:41] hanging on the
[1:31:46] cross so he knew he had tested it and if
[1:31:51] it held then it'll hold now
[1:31:54] that's the reason I know this oldtime
[1:31:56] God heartfelt salvation will hold the
[1:31:59] reputation of Christ is in it that's
[1:32:02] right he will not give us something to
[1:32:04] build a church out of some man-made
[1:32:06] theology or some school experience or
[1:32:08] some Seminary or something to educate
[1:32:11] the but the real preacher comes from the
[1:32:13] Seminary of God's grace and God's
[1:32:17] calling it's time tested it'll hold
[1:32:20] God's got confidence in
[1:32:22] you hello somebody God's got confidence
[1:32:26] in
[1:32:33] you she's anchored somewhere that maybe
[1:32:36] you can't see like the poet said my
[1:32:39] anchor holds within the veil every high
[1:32:41] and stormy Gale my anchor holds within
[1:32:43] the veil we don't know what's holding
[1:32:45] but something's holding she's anchored
[1:32:47] Yonder in the heaven that's a rope of
[1:32:49] Salvation that holds a human heart
[1:32:52] that's a man that's ever been born Born
[1:32:54] Again passed from death and life all
[1:32:56] Devils Out of Hell couldn't make him
[1:32:58] doubt it something holds within there
[1:33:01] let her rock let her Shake it'll hold
[1:33:04] every time because it's in Christ
[1:33:09] Jesus this man he didn't ask somebody
[1:33:12] else to go across the bridge first he
[1:33:14] went across the bridge
[1:33:15] himself he got all the the story is he
[1:33:18] got all the press out and he he got the
[1:33:20] locomotives out and he got the heavy
[1:33:22] equipment out and he going to put all
[1:33:23] all this weight on this bridge cuz he
[1:33:25] had confidence that he had put all all
[1:33:28] all of his work and everything he had
[1:33:29] done amen amen to to make sure it was
[1:33:32] going to work he knew what he had and he

[1:33:45] whistles went to blow and the horns went
[1:33:46] to honking and a great awful vibration
[1:33:49] take place but he walked right across
[1:33:51] that bridge and she never moved he took
[1:33:53] the Forefront and he said Jesus Christ
[1:33:56] has come from Heaven to Glory from Glory
[1:33:59] down here to build a church and the
[1:34:01] material he's putting in US is time
[1:34:03] tested material you might come to an
[1:34:06] altar and make a confession but when he
[1:34:08] finds blo holes and he finds a spot
[1:34:10] there he'll pitch it to one side and
[1:34:12] he'll pitch it on that side God want you
[1:34:15] to
[1:34:16] hold God wants you to last he can't
[1:34:20] place you anywhere until you have that
[1:34:23] spirit on the inside of
[1:34:25] [Applause]

[1:35:38] about
[1:35:40] a a story or something called Sail
[1:35:44] on he said when Christopher Columbus was
[1:35:47] given
[1:35:49] ships by the queen of Spain because his
[1:35:51] heart he saw a vision of a world that
[1:35:53] was
[1:35:55] round and he had hardly a way he could
[1:35:57] prove it he had nothing to do it with
[1:36:00] but he was a man of vision he believed
[1:36:04] it you know back then they had excuses
[1:36:06] for believing the world's flat today you
[1:36:09] ain't got a lick of
[1:36:12] excuse you believe a World's flat
[1:36:14] because you're just an idiot that's all
[1:36:16] I can
[1:36:18] say but he was a man of vision and when
