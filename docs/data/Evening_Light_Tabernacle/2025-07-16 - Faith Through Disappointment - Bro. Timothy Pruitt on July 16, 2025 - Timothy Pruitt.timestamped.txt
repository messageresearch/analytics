[34:21] to our hearts. you'd help us, Lord, to
[34:24] walk through the scriptures and through

[34:30] to be said, Father, and Lord, may our
[34:33] minds and hearts be on you, Father.
[34:35] Forgive us, Lord. We're we may have done
[34:38] wrong or done something, Lord, not
[34:40] pleasing to you, Lord. Wash us with the
[34:42] water of the word, your blood, Father.
[34:45] Fill every fiber of our lives. We pray,
[34:47] Father, with your presence. We give this
[34:51] service to you Lord for your glory and
[34:53] for your honor in Jesus name. Amen.
[34:58] Turn to Luke chap 24 verse 13.
[35:03] Amen.
[35:14] says, "Behold, two of them went that
[35:16] same day to a village called Emmas,
[35:19] which was from Jerusalem about three
[35:21] score furonging furlongs, and they
[35:24] talked together of all these things
[35:26] which had happened. It came to pass that
[35:29] while they communed together and
[35:30] reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and
[35:34] went with them.
[35:37] And their eyes were holding that they
[35:40] should not know him. And he said unto
[35:43] them, "What manner of communications are
[35:45] these that you have one to another as
[35:48] you walk and are sad?"
[35:51] And the one of them whose name was
[35:53] Cleopus answered and said unto him, "Art
[35:55] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem? Hast
[35:57] not thou known the things which are come
[36:00] to pass there in these days? And he said
[36:03] unto them, what things? And they said
[36:04] unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth,
[36:06] which was a prophet, mighty in deed, and
[36:08] word before God, and all the people, and
[36:11] how the chief priests, and our our
[36:13] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[36:15] death, and have crucified him. But we
[36:17] trust that it had been that it had been
[36:20] with he which should have redeemed
[36:21] Israel. And besides all this, today is
[36:24] the third day since these things were
[36:26] done. Yay. And certain women also of our
[36:28] company made us astonished which were
[36:30] early at the suppler. And when they
[36:32] found not his body, they came saying,
[36:34] they had also seen a vision of angels,
[36:37] which said that he was alive. And
[36:39] certain of them which were with us went
[36:41] to the supplr and found it, even so as
[36:43] the women had said, but him they saw
[36:45] not. Then he said unto them, "Oh fools,
[36:48] and slow of heart to believe all the
[36:50] prophets have spoken. All not Christ
[36:52] have suffered these things to enter into
[36:54] his glory? And beginning at Moses and
[36:56] all the prophets, he expounded unto them
[37:00] and all the scriptures the things
[37:01] concerning himself. And they drew nigh
[37:04] not into the village whether they went.
[37:05] And he made as though he would go
[37:07] further. But they constrained him,
[37:09] saying, abide with us for toward evening
[37:11] and the day is far spent. And he went in
[37:14] to tar with them. And it came to pass as
[37:17] he sat at meat with them. He took bread
[37:19] and blessed it and break and gave to
[37:21] them and their eyes were open and they
[37:24] knew him and he vanished out of their
[37:26] sight. And they said one to another,
[37:28] "Did not our heart burn within us while
[37:31] he taught with us by the way and while
[37:34] he opened to us the scriptures?" Amen.
[37:37] You can be seated for a moment.
[37:40] like to also read Matthew chapter 15 and
[37:43] verse 22- 28 says behold a woman of
[37:47] Canaan came out of the same coast and
[37:50] cried unto him saying have mercy on me
[37:53] oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is
[37:56] grievy grievously vexed with a devil but
[38:00] he answered her not a word and his
[38:02] disciples came and besought him saying
[38:04] her away for she crith after us but he
[38:07] answered said I'm not sent unto the lost
[38:09] sheep of the house of Israel And she
[38:10] came and worshiped him, saying, "Lord,
[38:13] help me." And he answered and said, "It
[38:15] is not meat to take children's bread and
[38:17] cast it to the dogs." And she said,
[38:19] "Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat the
[38:22] crumbs which fall from under the
[38:24] master's table." Then Jesus answered and
[38:27] said unto her, "Oh woman, great is thy
[38:29] faith. Be it unto thee, even as thy
[38:32] wilt." And her daughter was made whole
[38:35] from that very hour. I'd like to speak
[38:38] this evening on faith through the uh
[38:41] disappointment.
[38:43] Uh I know we all have faced
[38:45] disappointments in our lives and and we
[38:48] know disappointments can come in many
[38:50] ways and and you know this this
[38:52] disappointment means a sadness or
[38:54] displeasure caused by the nonfulfillment
[38:58] of your hope or expectation.
[39:01] You know, disappointments can come from,
[39:03] of course, personal failures where you
[39:05] feel like you failed in life or failed
[39:07] in certain ventures or or failed in a
[39:10] certain thing on a day and be
[39:12] disappointed in in how you performed or
[39:15] it can actually you can actually be of
[39:17] course disappointed uh not just with
[39:19] yourself but also with the actions of
[39:21] others or you can even be disappointed
[39:25] in God because you you you you find
[39:28] yourself or what you thought or what
[39:30] might be uh becoming short of what you
[39:33] had in mind or what you had planned and
[39:36] and it's a perceived shortcoming of
[39:38] God's plan. But when you know when
[39:41] things don't turn out like we thought it
[39:43] would. We we get disappointed and you
[39:46] know we all have those things in our
[39:48] life. We've all faced those moments in
[39:50] our lives and and it's and it's not that
[39:52] we're never of course ever going to have
[39:54] other disappointments if time carries.
[39:57] uh you know may may you may face that in
[39:59] the next hour or the next day or the
[40:01] next week but it's it's what you do when
[40:04] you become disappointed. It's how you
[40:06] react when you become disappointed. And
[40:09] and we read the scripture this woman uh
[40:11] this little Greek woman that came to
[40:13] Jesus and you know she had heard of him.
[40:16] She had heard of his healing. She had
[40:18] heard of his deliverances and the
[40:20] miracles that had taken place around his
[40:22] ministry. And of course she had a need
[40:23] as we read in the scripture. She had a
[40:25] daughter that that was grievously vexed
[40:27] of a devil and and but she had heard
[40:30] that there was somebody that could maybe
[40:31] help her and she she heard these words
[40:34] of the miracles that had taken place and
[40:36] she thought well if God could do that
[40:38] for those and he could do it for me and
[40:41] she believed it and she even though she
[40:42] had many hindrances hindrances you know
[40:46] her faith just didn't seem to have
[40:47] hindrances she she would stay very
[40:50] steady in her walk toward the Lord and
[40:52] we could look at her as her fa as she
[40:54] would come towards him and and you know
[40:57] maybe you know maybe somebody would say
[40:59] well you're not from that race or you
[41:01] know why are you going there you're a
[41:02] Greek you know he's a Jew you know it's
[41:04] not coming from your church or from your
[41:06] place or where you're at but you know
[41:08] you're she was a human being and she had
[41:10] been created by God and she had a need
[41:13] and she had faith that she was going to
[41:15] get what she had need of and no matter
[41:18] what disappointment she may face or not
[41:20] m no matter what would happen amen she
[41:23] started out in faith and she ended in
[41:25] faith. And I I want that to be said
[41:27] about me. Amen. That I not just started
[41:29] out in faith, but I ended in faith.
[41:32] Amen. That God could find faith in my
[41:34] life. And you know, and she'd meet
[41:36] critics along the way and people that
[41:38] would no doubt say things to her like,
[41:40] you know, that well that he used to do
[41:42] that then, but he doesn't do that now.
[41:44] You know, days of miracles are past, you
[41:46] know, he does that just for the Jews and
[41:48] you're a you're you're you're you're a
[41:50] gentile, you know. But she was
[41:52] persistent. She was persevering. There
[41:54] was something in her. No matter what
[41:56] anybody said around her, no matter what
[41:59] somebody else's testimony was, her
[42:01] testimony was, "I'm going to get to
[42:03] Jesus, and Jesus is going to heal my
[42:06] girl." And so, first thing you know, she
[42:08] had something she had something inside
[42:10] of her that told her she was going to
[42:13] get what she was going to ask for. And
[42:15] it didn't matter what happened as we've
[42:18] read. I mean, it's quite amazing story
[42:20] because here she come, you know, to
[42:22] Jesus and and she gets right up to him
[42:25] and after all of the problems and all of
[42:28] the situations and all the struggling
[42:30] and all the naysaying and all the
[42:33] doubting and all the things that she had
[42:35] heard before she even got there. She
[42:37] gets to him and then the real trial
[42:40] really begins. Amen. She gets to him and
[42:43] he he begins to he don't even speak to
[42:45] her. He don't even acknowledge her. He
[42:47] don't even he don't even look her way,
[42:49] you know. And she cries out even more.
[42:52] And the disciples are saying, "Why don't
[42:53] you just send her away?" You know, she's
[42:55] just she she's just in the way here what
[42:57] we're trying to do. Won't you just send
[42:59] her away? And he says, you know, I
[43:00] wasn't even sent to her house. I I
[43:03] wasn't even sent to her race. That's not
[43:06] who I was sent for. And and she hears
[43:08] these words and all these things begin
[43:10] to come. You're talking about a lot of
[43:12] disappointments that could arose in her
[43:14] life. and and she could have just walked
[43:15] away and said, "Well, you know, my I I
[43:18] thought he loved people. I thought he
[43:19] cared for people, but I guess he doesn't
[43:21] just he doesn't care about me." But that
[43:23] wasn't her attitude. She She looked past
[43:26] all of those disappointments. She looked
[43:29] past all of those things that had rose
[43:32] up around her. And he said, "You know,
[43:33] I'm not even sent to you race of dogs."
[43:35] Could you imagine what we would do or
[43:37] how we would react if Jesus we would
[43:40] come to him and he would call us a dog?
[43:42] Come on, somebody. You know, we get our
[43:44] feelings hurt and our nose up, been out
[43:46] of shape when when the pastor says
[43:48] something we don't agree with, right?
[43:50] Amen. But listen, this woman had that
[43:52] was called a dog. That's one of the
[43:54] lowest things you can call somebody.
[43:56] Amen. A dog that that would just, you
[43:58] know, a dog is not a very clean animal.
[44:00] It'll eat its own dung. It'll eat its
[44:02] own vomit. It'll it'll wall around and
[44:05] all kinds of stuff. And, you know, and
[44:07] he called her one of the lowest names
[44:09] that could be called. And then, you
[44:11] know, she could have got disappointed.
[44:12] She could have pulled back. She could
[44:14] have said, "You know what? Forget this.
[44:16] I'm just going to do my own thing. I I'm
[44:18] just going to go seek help somewhere
[44:19] else." But no, there was something on
[44:21] the inside of her she was going to get
[44:24] what she asked for. No matter what was
[44:27] said, no matter what was going on, what
[44:29] a disappointment that would have been to
[44:31] a woman who didn't have that kind of
[44:34] faith, who wasn't determined. Amen. And
[44:37] I believe that's the way we ought to be
[44:39] in this walk walk with God. We ought to
[44:41] be determined.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Determined. If if the preacher
[44:46] burns my hide, I'm still determined. If
[44:48] if things don't go the way I think they
[44:50] ought to go, I'm still determined. Amen.
[44:53] If everything turns against me and
[44:55] people call me all kinds of names, I'm
[44:58] still determined. I'm determined. Amen.
[45:00] Because I've got something in my heart
[45:02] and I'm going to get the request that I
[45:05] have. Amen. Maybe your request is not
[45:07] for a daughter that's grievously vexed.
[45:09] But I tell you what my request is. My
[45:11] request is for a body change. My request
[45:14] is for a resurrection. My request is for
[45:17] getting out of this old world and
[45:19] leaving. And I want a determination that
[45:21] no matter what goes on around me or what
[45:24] happens in the church or what does goes
[45:26] right in the church or what goes wrong
[45:28] in the church, I want to be determined
[45:30] that I'm going to meet my expectation of
[45:33] a body change. And so here she is and
[45:36] she could have turned around many times.
[45:38] You know what, brother Brandon looked at
[45:39] her and said, "You know what? What the
[45:41] deal was?" She held on because she
[45:43] wasn't a hot house plant.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. She didn't have to be babyed
[45:48] around. One of these kinds, you know,
[45:50] you have to spray over to keep the bugs
[45:52] off of it. A good healthy plant, you
[45:54] don't have to do that. A bug won't but
[45:56] won't be able to get if it's full of
[45:57] health. But that's kind of like a good
[45:59] bornagain faith of in God. a real
[46:02] genuine Holy Ghost faith. Nothing is
[46:05] going to run it off.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Nothing is going to turn it turn it
[46:10] around. It can't be done. It's
[46:12] persistence. It's going to the goal that
[46:15] God has promised it. Nothing is going to
[46:18] turn it down. It's going anyhow. She
[46:20] wasn't a hybrid. She had got a hold of
[46:23] something.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I may have told this
[46:28] here before, but it's a good good good
[46:30] to put it right in here. I I met a
[46:32] brother, brother Giovani, that lives in
[46:34] New York and and uh I met him up in in
[46:38] Canada at a meeting and and and he I was
[46:40] speaking to him just personally on some
[46:42] things and he was just telling me of his
[46:44] testimony and he said, you know, I got
[46:46] one child and he said, "It's a miracle
[46:48] that God give me that child." And and
[46:50] said, you know, my wife was she was born
[46:52] with without the ability to have
[46:54] children. his wife didn't have the
[46:56] ability. Something was up with in the
[46:58] female organs was wrong. And doctors
[47:00] said there wasn't no hope. And she was
[47:02] crying out to God for this child. And
[47:04] she was crying out to God for this
[47:05] child. And she was crying out to and he
[47:07] said honestly, he said, "I didn't know
[47:08] what to do." He said, "I was about to
[47:10] seem like going insane because I trying
[47:12] to hold the faith with her, trying to
[47:14] keep the right attitude, trying to do
[47:16] this." And finally, I was like, "Look,
[47:18] let's just go talk to the pastor again.
[47:19] Let's let's just go go there for a
[47:21] moment." And I called him up and asked
[47:22] him if I could bring my wife. and and he
[47:24] brought her over and he went down
[47:26] through her life and things and began to
[47:28] talk to her and he could come down to
[47:30] the very last moments. He said, he said,
[47:32] "Sister, let me ask you this question."
[47:34] He said, "What if God never gives you a
[47:37] child? Then what?
[47:40] What if God never gives you a child?"
[47:43] And maybe tonight you're not looking for
[47:45] a child or you're looking for something
[47:46] else. But what if God never gives you
[47:48] that? Then what?
[47:53] What about that? And he he said she just
[47:55] kind of bowed her head just for a moment
[47:57] and she looked down and he said I was he
[48:00] said I thought the earth was just
[48:01] shaking. You know I didn't know what was
[48:02] about to happen. He said he said all of
[48:04] a sudden she looked up and tears running
[48:06] down her eyes. She said I would love him
[48:09] anyhow.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; No matter what his answer is, I still
[48:14] love him.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; I'll serve him. I'll love him anyhow.
[48:19] And just within a few months, she was
[48:20] expecting a child. Amen. Why? Because it
[48:23] wasn't about what was going to happen or
[48:25] not going to happen. It was something on
[48:28] the inside of her that anchored deep
[48:30] that if God didn't answer the way I
[48:32] wanted, I'm going to love him anyhow. If
[48:34] God didn't move the way I want him to
[48:36] move, I'm going to love him anyhow.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; If God doesn't answer how I want him to
[48:42] answer, I'm going to serve him anyhow.
[48:46] And I'm not going to serve him with a
[48:48] sour face and a bad attitude. I'm going
[48:50] to serve him in faith.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to serve him in love.
[48:57] She wasn't a hybrid. She got a hold of
[49:00] something. You don't you know, you
[49:04] didn't have to baby her and spray her.
[49:06] And now, darling, please. Now, let me
[49:08] beg you, you should just, you know, no,
[49:10] everything tried to hinder this woman.
[49:13] He said, 'But a real Christian fights
[49:15] for his position. He has to stand alone
[49:18] sometimes, maybe just him and God, but
[49:20] he'll fight every inch of ground, but
[49:22] you will not have to baby him around.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. That's what's the
[49:29] matter. He said with the Pentecostal
[49:30] church, we got a bunch of Pentecostal
[49:32] babies, just a bunch of sprinkled and
[49:34] sprayed with this or another till it's
[49:36] run out to a bunch of hybrids. What we
[49:38] need today is a house cleaning. He said
[49:40] from the pull pit all the way to the
[49:42] janer and starting over getting some
[49:44] genuine faith born in the people again.
[49:47] She wasn't a hybrid or a so-called crop
[49:50] of believers is today. What did she do?
[49:52] She admitted you're right. I'm a dog.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; You're right. I'm a dog. Listen, that's
[49:59] the first thing you want to get anywhere
[50:01] with God, admit he's right.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; It might burn the hide off of you, but
[50:07] admit his word is right. If you want
[50:09] something from him, admit he's right.
[50:12] I'm wrong. Whatever he says, I accept.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; And here she is. You're right. I'm a
[50:17] dog. But even the dogs get the crumbs.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. We need some crumb seekers.
[50:25] Amen. Let's be willing to humble
[50:27] ourselves and say, "Whatever, Lord,
[50:28] whatever the word's got to do, I want
[50:30] it. If it's got to scrape me off, I want
[50:33] it. If it's got to take my pride off, I
[50:36] want it."
[50:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. If it's got to take my
[50:38] arrogance off, I want it. Whatever I
[50:40] got, I want the word to have its way in
[50:43] my life.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Faith always admits the word is right.
[50:49] He said, if your faith doesn't punctuate
[50:52] every word of God's word with amen,
[50:55] there's something wrong with your
[50:57] experience.
[50:59] Amen. You know, and it doesn't matter if
[51:02] you're if you're feeling it or not.
[51:05] Sometimes we ain't feeling it.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; I ain't felt it all day.
[51:13] I ain't felt it all day. I ain't felt
[51:15] like preaching all day. But it ain't
[51:17] about how I feel.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want I want my life to punctuate
[51:22] his word with an amen.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want my life Amen. I don't want
[51:27] to be just serving him out of a duty to
[51:29] where Amen. If you're serving God out of
[51:31] a duty, then when things are going
[51:32] wrong, you can see it all over you. You
[51:35] can see it in your attitude. You can see
[51:36] it in the way you walk or talk, the way
[51:38] you worship or don't worship. Amen.
[51:40] Because you're serving God out of a
[51:42] duty. I I don't want to serve him just
[51:44] out of a duty. I want to serve him
[51:46] because I love him.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; This is what he wanted all the way at
[51:50] the beginning. He didn't want to give
[51:51] the law and make it a bunch of little
[51:53] dos and don'ts and a duty that you got
[51:55] to do this and a duty that you got to do
[51:57] that. He said, "All that people would
[51:59] love me."
[52:00] &gt;&gt; He wants worship because you love him.
[52:02] He wants church because you love him.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And it goes beyond your disappointments
[52:10] and beyond what you feel or or you don't
[52:13] feel. I mean, the Bible said, you know,
[52:15] the Bible says he's the same yesterday,
[52:17] today, and forever. If it if you don't
[52:19] say amen to that, there's something
[52:20] wrong. Jesus said, "The works that I do,
[52:23] you do also." If I don't you don't say
[52:24] amen, there's something wrong. If it
[52:26] don't punctuate every word of God's
[52:28] promise with an amen, there's something
[52:30] wrong. She admitted, you're right. I'm
[52:32] nothing but a dog. But she's after a
[52:34] crumb. He said, "Wouldn't that be us?
[52:37] Shouldn't that be us? We have to be set
[52:39] up in a seat." Oh, if he don't minister
[52:41] me this night, if it I'm just going to
[52:44] go home. I I don't
[52:47] That didn't make no difference to her.
[52:50] She was persevering. She was determined.
[52:52] She was persistent. I'm getting
[52:54] something from the Lord. Something on
[52:56] the inside told her she was going to get
[52:58] what she wanted and go home with it.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Regardless of how long she had to
[53:03] wait, regardless of what she had to go
[53:05] through, regardless of how, you know,
[53:08] what all the I'm not even here for a
[53:10] full course dinner. I I'll just take a
[53:12] crumb.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Well, listen. If a crumb can heal a a
[53:17] girl that's grievously vexed by devil,
[53:19] don't you want a crumb, too?
[53:22] Come on, somebody. If just a little
[53:24] crumb of it, amen, will heal somebody.
[53:27] Don't you want a crumb? If a little
[53:29] crumb will save somebody, don't we want
[53:31] a crown?
[53:33] &gt;&gt; We want what God has for us.
[53:40] Brother Ram said, you know, she had
[53:41] actually never seen a miracle.
[53:45] She was a gentile, but she had faith.
[53:48] She was something kind of along the
[53:50] lines of the harlot Rahab
[53:53] when she had heard what had happened.
[53:56] She didn't see it, but she had heard and
[53:58] she believed it.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That sounds like a lot like us. We
[54:03] We may not have seen all of that take
[54:05] place, but we believe it anyhow.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, you know, he said, "Wait,
[54:10] wait." She she she didn't say, "Well,
[54:12] wait till you I see how Joshua, you
[54:14] know, he he does things and how all the
[54:16] generals, what kind of swords they got,
[54:18] what kind of instruments, what kind of
[54:19] warfare." She said, "I have already
[54:21] heard that God's with you, and that's
[54:24] good enough for me."
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want mercy. She believed.
[54:28] Amen. This is exactly what this woman
[54:30] did. There was something on the inside
[54:32] of her. Amen. And she said, "Lord,
[54:37] first, you know, thou son of David." And
[54:38] he said, "Why was it? I didn't come.
[54:40] That's not you." But then she said,
[54:42] "Lord, he was her Lord."
[54:45] She come with the right approach. And
[54:48] the only way to ever, that's the only
[54:49] way to receive anything is come with the
[54:51] right approach. Humble yourself before
[54:54] God. Humble your pride. Humble humble
[54:56] your life. Humble your situation and
[54:58] say, "God, you have your way in my
[55:00] life."
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you got a critical spirit, you
[55:04] want to get rid of it, do the opposite.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, have your way in my life.
[55:13] She had she had the right approach to
[55:15] God's gift. And that's the only way
[55:16] you'll ever receive anything. It comes
[55:19] with the right approach. Faith admits
[55:22] the word is right.
[55:25] Amen.
[55:27] Amen. Be willing to take any part.
[55:30] as well as direct quote. Be willing to
[55:33] take any part anywhere just as soul as
[55:36] long as I get there.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; That's the way it ought to be in the
[55:43] house of God. I'll take any part.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; I'll play any part. I'll do anything.
[55:48] Just as long as I get there.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; That's all that matters. Amen. It
[55:53] doesn't matter if I play the piano or I
[55:55] don't play the piano. If I sing or I
[55:56] don't sing. Amen. if I'm a special
[55:58] singer or not a special singer. Amen. As
[56:00] long as I'm there.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Listen, that's really the goal of what
[56:05] we have church for is to get there.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. It's not about right
[56:11] now or even the next five minutes is to
[56:13] get there.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; As long as we keep that in our mind and
[56:18] all the
[56:20] all the other stuff we talk about and
[56:23] pick about and talk about. Come on now.
[56:27] This is where Cleopus and them was. They
[56:29] was kind of picking apart the day,
[56:32] &gt;&gt; you know, uh, downhearted, discouraged.
[56:37] Why were they that way? Because
[56:38] disappointment had come.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Disappointed,
[56:42] discouraged,
[56:44] downhearted
[56:45] on one of the greatest days it had ever
[56:48] been.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Huh? Think about that. That's kind of a
[56:53] paradox, right? just disappointed,
[56:56] discouraged, downhearted on one of the
[56:59] greatest days it had ever been.
[57:03] Jesus had raised from the dead. He had
[57:06] conquered death, hell, and the grave.
[57:08] And they were disappointed.
[57:11] Amen. Sometimes we get so caught up in
[57:13] our disappointment, we fail to realize
[57:15] what's going on really around us.
[57:18] Amen. Listen, he said there there were
[57:21] men and he said maybe there's men and
[57:22] women here today that's had a lot of
[57:24] disappointments. But remember this,
[57:27] Jesus is raised from the dead.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Come on now. He's still alive today,
[57:33] right?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; So keep this in mind. He's still alive
[57:37] today. And here they are discouraged
[57:39] going back on, well, you know, it
[57:41] started out all right. We thought it was
[57:43] going to be all right. and and you know
[57:44] they get all tore up and and you you you
[57:47] wonder first you don't even get a clue
[57:48] of their conversation because they don't
[57:50] tell them about all what they're saying
[57:52] but when Jesus steps in he begins to let
[57:54] you know they weren't talking about
[57:56] things that lifted them up they were
[57:58] talking about things that tore them down
[58:00] &gt;&gt; right they were they were downhearted he
[58:03] said why you what what what manner of
[58:04] conversation what what are you talking
[58:06] about here that you're so sad about
[58:12] &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter matter what we talk
[58:14] about.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It matters a lot what we talk
[58:19] about.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; And here they are discouraged,
[58:25] but they were talking about him and they
[58:27] were discussing things and they couldn't
[58:30] figure it out and they and here but he
[58:33] said, "Brother Brandon said, at least
[58:35] they had him in their conversation.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; At least they were talking about Jesus.
[58:41] They may not have understood everything.
[58:43] They may have not have known what was
[58:45] happening, but at least they were
[58:47] talking about Jesus.
[58:51] I
[58:51] &gt;&gt; I hope that's what our conversations are
[58:53] about. You know, sometimes we go home,
[58:55] we talk about things that happened to
[58:56] the church. Are you talking about Jesus
[58:58] or you just talking about all the
[59:00] disappointments you got? Are you talking
[59:02] about all the things around you that
[59:04] don't seem right or don't seem all the
[59:06] or are you really talking You want God
[59:08] to come by, start talking about him. You
[59:11] want him to draw near to you. Start
[59:13] talking about him. Start dwelling on
[59:15] him. Start thinking about him.
[59:20] He said that's the reason he doesn't
[59:22] appear so many to us today. Our
[59:24] conversations is about everything else
[59:27] but Christ.
[59:29] We we we're talking about when we're
[59:31] going to get work done or what we're
[59:33] going to do here.
[59:35] Let our conversations be about him and
[59:37] he appears and then you can talk to him.
[59:39] be speaking about him. They were doing
[59:41] they were going along and yet they loved
[59:43] him but they didn't know he had raised
[59:45] from the dead. He said many people's
[59:48] like that today too. They really love
[59:49] Jesus throughout all the world have the
[59:52] love of the Lord but they don't know
[59:54] he's raised from the dead. As they went
[59:56] along as they went along a stranger said
[59:59] good morning and they're all sad and
[1:00:01] broken up said good morning.
[1:00:05] Cleopus looked back and said oh I loved
[1:00:06] him. I I I seen him stand by the grave
[1:00:08] of Lazarus and a man been dead four days
[1:00:11] and and and Lazarus come forth and how
[1:00:13] could this man ever fail like this? How
[1:00:15] how could he fail and die? How how could
[1:00:18] this happen? You know, I guess we're
[1:00:20] just going to go home and start up our
[1:00:22] carpet and work again, you know. And he
[1:00:25] said, brother said, "Isn't that a lot
[1:00:27] like modern Christian today? Let a
[1:00:29] healing take place, they're shouting of
[1:00:31] victory. Let the power of the Holy
[1:00:32] Spirit fall, they're shouting of
[1:00:33] victory. those who are really filled
[1:00:35] with the Holy Spirit uh remains that way
[1:00:38] down through life's journey. But the man
[1:00:40] that's still walking with the carnal
[1:00:42] mind, let a little discouragement come
[1:00:44] up, a little something go wrong, and
[1:00:46] well, I thought it was going to be okay,
[1:00:48] but look at it now. And I thought this
[1:00:50] little church wouldn't fail, and I
[1:00:52] thought that man wouldn't fail. I
[1:00:54] thought this wasn't be like just like
[1:00:55] this.
[1:00:59] Come on. Oh, it's shouting while just a
[1:01:02] few moments ago when somebody got
[1:01:03] healed, shouting when somebody got
[1:01:05] saved. He said a Holy Ghost person
[1:01:07] filled person will stay that way. That's
[1:01:09] what he just said.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; He said a Holy Ghost person will stay
[1:01:12] that way, but a man that is still
[1:01:15] walking with a carnal mind. Their
[1:01:18] intellectual ability let a little
[1:01:20] discouragement come up. Well, I thought
[1:01:22] my life would be like this. And I I
[1:01:25] thought surely if if you know, but I
[1:01:27] thought I thought I was going to turn
[1:01:29] out this way and I thought I'd be
[1:01:30] married and I thought I'd have this and
[1:01:32] I thought I'd have that and I thought I
[1:01:34] thought I thought I thought
[1:01:38] it ain't about what we think.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; It's about his plan for us.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't let the discouragement
[1:01:46] become so big that you don't see what's
[1:01:48] going on right around you. That the
[1:01:50] resurrection is taking place. that
[1:01:53] there's a a message that is coming this
[1:01:55] hour that has called you out of sin.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; That's the main thing. It's filled with
[1:02:01] you with the Holy Ghost. That's the main
[1:02:03] thing. It's getting you ready for a body
[1:02:05] change. That's the main thing.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; We get our minds on the wrong thing.
[1:02:18] Well, I thought I thought it, you know,
[1:02:22] that that the church service should go
[1:02:24] like this and I I thought this should be
[1:02:26] this way. And I thought we we got our
[1:02:28] minds on the wrong thing.
[1:02:31] Get it on Jesus.
[1:02:33] He's trying to do something. He's trying
[1:02:36] to reveal something. He's trying to talk
[1:02:38] to us. He said, "Let your conversation,"
[1:02:40] Listen to this. Underline this same
[1:02:42] quote. Let your conversation not be
[1:02:45] about your church, but about your Lord.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother Brandon. That's
[1:02:54] really good. Let your conversation not
[1:02:57] be about your church. Let it be about
[1:03:00] the Lord. Yeah,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; I wonder how my how our conversations
[1:03:05] would be if it wouldn't be so centered
[1:03:07] around what maybe not, you know,
[1:03:08] nitpicking stuff or this that and the
[1:03:10] other by, you know, music or AC's or
[1:03:12] sound, whatever. And we get our minds
[1:03:14] and our conversations so tore up about
[1:03:16] that stuff and that's all we can see.
[1:03:18] But what would it be if our
[1:03:20] conversations was about the Lord
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; and what he's really doing in this day
[1:03:25] and how he's moving in this hour, how
[1:03:28] he's moving in this church.
[1:03:30] Yes.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; How he's saving the lost, how he's
[1:03:33] healing the sick, how he's raising the
[1:03:35] dead, how he's moving and changing. And
[1:03:37] even if we ain't even see him working,
[1:03:39] he's still working.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; We get our minds on the wrong things.
[1:03:48] He said, "It's not about your neighbor,
[1:03:51] but it's about your Lord. Let your
[1:03:53] conversation be of him." And as they
[1:03:55] journey along, why why are you so sad?
[1:03:57] He said, "What makes you feel this way?
[1:04:01] What a beautiful day." Could you imagine
[1:04:04] that? I mean, that would be incredible.
[1:04:06] Here Jesus steps out of the bushes,
[1:04:09] joins in on their walk. Why? Why are you
[1:04:12] so sad?
[1:04:14] Why are you so downhearted? Why? Why?
[1:04:16] Why? Why? Why are you look It is a
[1:04:18] beautiful day.
[1:04:22] It's so beautiful. Look, hear the birds
[1:04:24] singing here. Here, look. Look, look,
[1:04:27] look at what's going Look at the
[1:04:28] sunrise. Look, look at what's happening
[1:04:30] around us.
[1:04:33] Well, you know, we we trusted in this
[1:04:35] man named Jesus. And he seemed to be
[1:04:38] approved of God. He had great signs and
[1:04:40] he had great wonders and we followed him
[1:04:42] three and a half years. And but Pilate
[1:04:44] crucified him. They buried him and put
[1:04:46] him in the grave. He would we we had
[1:04:48] hope that he would be a great king, a
[1:04:50] great leader. Oh, now we see their hopes
[1:04:53] was in the wrong place.
[1:04:55] That's right.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. This is where we get
[1:04:58] our trouble. This This is where we we
[1:05:00] think we got faith. No, we got hope in
[1:05:02] the wrong place.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; They had faith he was going to be Amen.
[1:05:07] They thought they had faith he was going
[1:05:08] to be a deliverer from the Romans, but
[1:05:10] that wasn't what he came to do. There
[1:05:12] was hope in the wrong place. Come on,
[1:05:14] somebody. A lot of people get that same
[1:05:17] way. They get hope in the wrong place.
[1:05:19] Listen, my hope is not this world. My
[1:05:21] hope is not what happens in my
[1:05:23] circumstances. whether I've got
[1:05:25] something or I don't don't have
[1:05:27] anything. That's not my hope. My faith
[1:05:29] is in getting out of here. My faith is
[1:05:33] in a body chase. My faith is in the word
[1:05:35] of God and what he has said he's going
[1:05:38] to perform.
[1:05:44] But now he's in a grave and they say
[1:05:47] he's raised but we don't know. We hadn't
[1:05:49] seen his body. We don't. He said, "Well,
[1:05:52] don't you know the scriptures?" What did
[1:05:53] he do? He went straight to the
[1:05:55] scriptures.
[1:05:58] See what he was trying to do? Bring
[1:06:00] their faith back to the word.
[1:06:04] Put their hope back in the right place.
[1:06:08] He said, "Any true spirit of God will go
[1:06:11] straight to the scriptures." What did he
[1:06:12] do? Went back to the Old Testament. Went
[1:06:15] back to the books of Moses. Begin to
[1:06:17] speak about Moses and the different
[1:06:18] ones. And they said that Jesus would
[1:06:20] come, how we would suffer, and what he
[1:06:22] would do. He said, ' Don't you know
[1:06:23] this? The scripture, the word, don't you
[1:06:24] know the word that was back there has
[1:06:26] been made alive? Don't you know that the
[1:06:28] Christ that now that said they that he
[1:06:30] said there he would not suffer and see
[1:06:32] his body suffer corruption? Don't you
[1:06:34] see? And he's walking them right down
[1:06:35] through the scriptures.
[1:06:37] He no, we didn't know that. He said good
[1:06:40] people loving him but didn't know he was
[1:06:42] risen from the dead. So it is today.
[1:06:44] Same thing. God wake our most innermost
[1:06:48] being. People don't understand that he
[1:06:51] has raised from the dead. He's not dead.
[1:06:53] He's alive. That's what our our thoughts
[1:06:56] ought to be on. We have a God that's
[1:06:58] alive.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. A God that's alive. A
[1:07:03] God that conquered death. A God that
[1:07:05] conquered the grave. A God that rose up
[1:07:07] from the grave.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; That's who we're worshiping here. That's
[1:07:11] why we're not concerned if this is
[1:07:12] perfect or if that is perfect or
[1:07:14] everything's exact order. We want a God
[1:07:17] who's alive. We want a God moving among
[1:07:20] us performing the same things he did
[1:07:23] back then.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; That is the focus of this church.
[1:07:34] He says
[1:07:40] things begin to turn and brother
[1:07:41] Brandham really hammers it down. He said
[1:07:43] it began to turn. It was getting towards
[1:07:46] evening time. He said, "Do you get it?
[1:07:48] Evening time. Get it? Evening time." And
[1:07:52] he just hammers it down. And he said he
[1:07:55] he made as if he was going to go on by
[1:07:58] as they were turning into their place.
[1:08:01] He's going to go on by. And they said,
[1:08:03] "Oh, no, no, no. Come on in here. Talk
[1:08:06] to us some more." And they persuaded him
[1:08:08] to come inside.
[1:08:11] is I wonder how much persuading we do
[1:08:13] today.
[1:08:16] I wonder how much you are doing right
[1:08:18] now. He says right now, oh Lord, the
[1:08:23] resurrected one, let me persuade you to
[1:08:25] come by my heart. Come in with me. I I
[1:08:29] want to believe you. I I maybe have
[1:08:30] lived just a halfway life, Christian
[1:08:32] life, just by believing in a knowledge
[1:08:34] of faith or just so forth, so-called
[1:08:37] intellectual faith. But I want to know
[1:08:38] you in the power of your resurrection.
[1:08:41] For this is the only time I have to make
[1:08:43] preparation. I want to know you when I
[1:08:45] lay my head down to rise no more. I want
[1:08:48] to know you in the power of your
[1:08:49] resurrection. I don't want no guessing
[1:08:52] about it. I want to know you. The day is
[1:08:55] far spent.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; When they got inside, they closed the
[1:09:03] doors and he begin to talk to them.
[1:09:11] And the scripture says he took bread
[1:09:16] and he break it.
[1:09:20] It was something that opened their eyes
[1:09:22] cuz they'd walked with him all evening
[1:09:24] and didn't know who he was.
[1:09:26] They brought him in their his house and
[1:09:28] they still didn't know who he was. But
[1:09:30] it was when he broke bread.
[1:09:35] It wasn't just the tearing of the bread.
[1:09:38] Any man could tear bread. Any man could
[1:09:41] take a knife and slice bread. Any man
[1:09:43] could any man could do that. But that's
[1:09:45] not not any man could tear off a piece
[1:09:47] of bread and there be another one take
[1:09:49] his place.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; And he tear off a piece of bread and
[1:09:53] there be another. There was only one man
[1:09:55] that could do that.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And here he was. He tore off a
[1:09:59] piece of bread and their eyes came open.
[1:10:03] Oh, hallelujah. He's showing them that
[1:10:06] he was the same yesterday, today, and
[1:10:08] forever. The same God that went down is
[1:10:11] the same God that came up.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He had the same power. He
[1:10:16] had the same abilities. He had the same
[1:10:18] anointing. He had the same word. He had
[1:10:20] the same ability to tear off that bread.
[1:10:23] And there come another piece. And let me
[1:10:25] tell you tonight, he still has that
[1:10:27] ability.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; If you need a piece of bread tonight, he
[1:10:31] can tear it off for you and give you
[1:10:33] your own miracle. That's right.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; They said there was only one man on
[1:10:44] earth that could ever do that and that's
[1:10:45] him.
[1:10:47] Just the way he done that. Not the way
[1:10:49] he formed his sermon, not the way he
[1:10:51] dressed, not the way he talked, but the
[1:10:55] way he done something, they knew that
[1:10:57] that was his way of doing it.
[1:11:00] Hallelujah. Their eyes were open. They
[1:11:03] knew him. They didn't know him a few
[1:11:05] hours before. They they never seen it.
[1:11:08] And here their eyes was open and all of
[1:11:10] a sudden they said, "Hey, we recognize
[1:11:12] this is the one. This is the one who
[1:11:15] told us these." Didn't our hearts burn
[1:11:17] within us as he talked with us and he
[1:11:20] spoke with us along the way.
[1:11:25] I wonder how many services he's come
[1:11:27] though,
[1:11:29] come by our way.
[1:11:31] And he made as if he was to go by and we
[1:11:34] let him.
[1:11:40] We let him. He made as if he was one. He
[1:11:44] He wanted to come to you. He wanted to
[1:11:46] drive no dry draw nigh to you. He wanted
[1:11:49] to pull himself to you. He wanted to
[1:11:51] pull you to himself. But he walks by
[1:11:53] your pew.
[1:11:56] And our thoughts are on this and
[1:11:57] disappointments and problems and
[1:11:59] situations, things we got going on
[1:12:01] tomorrow morning. All the stuff that's
[1:12:02] happening around us and the situ
[1:12:05] I don't know how I'm going to do this
[1:12:07] and I don't know. And Jesus is walking
[1:12:08] right by.
[1:12:11] He's waiting for somebody reach out
[1:12:15] and touch the Lord
[1:12:18] as he passes by.
[1:12:22] Oh my. He comes by service after
[1:12:25] service.
[1:12:27] We've seen him come by service after
[1:12:30] service in these last few weeks and
[1:12:32] speak things and the business minister
[1:12:33] come in and speak things. He's coming by
[1:12:36] service after service. Re don't you know
[1:12:38] what's happening? Don't you see what's
[1:12:39] going on? Don't you get your eyes off
[1:12:41] the disappointments. Get your eyes off
[1:12:44] the world. Get your eyes off the bombs
[1:12:45] talking and the nuclear talks and then
[1:12:47] say, "Get your eyes off all of that. Get
[1:12:50] your eyes on me
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; because I'm about to tear off a piece of
[1:12:54] bread.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you the bread he's about to
[1:12:58] tear off. He's going to do what he did
[1:13:00] then. This body is going to change.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; It's going to change. He's going to tear
[1:13:06] off this old rag and a new one's going
[1:13:09] to come. Amen. A new body is going to
[1:13:11] come. Listen. He's looking for somebody
[1:13:13] that is looking for his appearing.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Looking for his appearing.
[1:13:20] Not caught up in the church squables.
[1:13:22] Not caught up in the this that and the
[1:13:23] well that's just a click. It's just
[1:13:24] this. It's just that. That's not what
[1:13:26] this is about.
[1:13:29] It's about Jesus
[1:13:31] and him walking by service.
[1:13:34] Reach out and touch the Lord.
[1:13:39] Dark hours come,
[1:13:41] tragic things happen,
[1:13:45] disappointments
[1:13:46] come, death comes.
[1:13:50] But in the face of it all, brother says,
[1:13:52] I rest on that beautiful hope that he
[1:13:54] said, I am the resurrection and the
[1:13:56] life.
[1:13:58] I am the resurrection and the life. And
[1:14:00] he that believeth in me, though he were
[1:14:03] dead, yet he shall live.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; He said, I've seen disappointments.
[1:14:13] He said, I've seen the time I've asked
[1:14:15] for things.
[1:14:17] I've cried for things. I've begged for
[1:14:22] things
[1:14:23] and failed to get them.
[1:14:28] Hello.
[1:14:30] I I've asked, I've cried, I've begged,
[1:14:33] and failed to get them. But if I would
[1:14:35] just wait patiently upon God and know
[1:14:39] that it works exactly right at the exact
[1:14:43] time he does exactly the right thing.
[1:14:48] Hallelujah. That ought to give us faith
[1:14:51] right there to know. He said when I lost
[1:14:54] my baby, my little Sharon, there was one
[1:14:56] thing that stumbled me. I said, "How can
[1:14:58] that be for the good? How can it be for
[1:15:01] the good? How can this be for my good?
[1:15:04] My little baby would die. Months later,
[1:15:07] when I seen her standing there in all
[1:15:09] the beauty of a young lady speaking to
[1:15:11] me, standing by the side of that old
[1:15:13] wagon broken down, I knew if she had
[1:15:16] lived, she might have turned out wrong.
[1:15:24] Hello.
[1:15:29] She might have turned out wrong. You
[1:15:31] know, we get that sometime we get so sad
[1:15:33] about young and it is sad. I'm not
[1:15:35] saying it ain't. I mean, God help us. I
[1:15:37] I know I how I would feel or I don't
[1:15:39] even want to feel that way.
[1:15:44] But you see families that lose little
[1:15:47] children
[1:15:49] and I look at it and then they're not
[1:15:51] serving God. Some of them atheists, some
[1:15:53] of them this, that, and the other. And
[1:15:55] these little children die of this of
[1:15:57] disease or die from birth or whatever.
[1:16:00] And I think God, you saved that one.
[1:16:05] You saved that one. And here the prophet
[1:16:08] of God would even look at his own child
[1:16:10] and say, "Later, when I saw her standing
[1:16:12] there on the other side, I knew if she
[1:16:15] would have came through life, she may
[1:16:17] have turned out wrong."
[1:16:21] God knows what he's doing.
[1:16:24] He has a plan. He says, "Every name that
[1:16:26] the Lord that has been given me is
[1:16:28] written in the palm of my hand. And
[1:16:30] nobody, nothing can take him out of my
[1:16:32] hands.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Everyone that supposed to be their
[1:16:36] redeemed sons and daughters of God,
[1:16:38] amen, that's been bought by the blood of
[1:16:41] Jesus Christ will be there.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; There ain't enough devils in hell to
[1:16:46] keep it from happening. Not to keep one
[1:16:48] from going.
[1:16:53] He'll do what he got to do. He knows the
[1:16:55] end from the beginning. We don't We
[1:16:56] don't know how things will work out. We
[1:16:58] don't know how things will turn out. We
[1:17:00] don't know what kind of heartaches will
[1:17:01] come that would turn somebody the wrong
[1:17:04] direction.
[1:17:08] He said, "I think of my wife of 22
[1:17:10] years."
[1:17:13] Let me go back. He said, "God had to
[1:17:15] take her." He said, "I knew if she had
[1:17:17] lived, she might have turned out wrong.
[1:17:19] God had to take her while she was tender
[1:17:21] and sweet. I know I'll see her again. I
[1:17:24] know I'll see her. I know it beyond any
[1:17:26] shadow of a doubt. I think of my wife of
[1:17:29] 22 years old taken just merely a girl,
[1:17:31] little mother. When the papers give the
[1:17:33] headline, "Young mother, Reverend died.
[1:17:36] Oh, how my heart bled. I didn't know
[1:17:38] what to do. But today, I know it's all
[1:17:41] working for my good."
[1:17:44] I know that life had had to be ground
[1:17:46] and twisted and squeezed to get what was
[1:17:48] in it out. There was too much brand in
[1:17:50] there. Had to be squeezed out before God
[1:17:52] can make himself known. It was too much
[1:17:54] of you and you till God has to squeeze
[1:17:56] you through disappointments and trials.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And while that squeezing was coming on,
[1:18:02] it's hard. But after a while, the skies
[1:18:05] are going to clear again.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The skies are going to clear
[1:18:10] back. And you will see the purpose of
[1:18:12] God. And you'll cry, "I know my redeemer
[1:18:16] liveth." And the last days I'll stand
[1:18:18] upon the earth. Though the skin worms
[1:18:21] destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall
[1:18:23] I see God. These little trials and
[1:18:25] things are just for a moment, and
[1:18:28] they'll fade away and pass. They're only
[1:18:31] done for your good. Let's remember that
[1:18:35] so God will get the glory.
[1:18:45] As we bring this to a close,
[1:18:51] leave you with one of my favorite quotes
[1:18:54] because discouragement comes in
[1:18:56] disappointments.
[1:18:58] Discouragement can set in. Through
[1:19:01] discouragement, depression and
[1:19:04] depression can come all kind of things.
[1:19:06] suicidal thoughts and spirits of every
[1:19:09] kind can attach.
[1:19:12] Get in a lot of places of discouragement
[1:19:14] sometimes because we're disappointed.
[1:19:18] And we're disappointed because our hope
[1:19:20] was in the wrong thing.
[1:19:25] But I leave you with this tonight. Don't
[1:19:26] be discouraged.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; We're living in a terrible hour.
[1:19:35] A terrible hour for the unbeliever,
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; but a wonderful hour for the believer.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; We are near the end time
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; to which we're looking for the coming of
[1:19:48] our blessed Lord. That's why we're here
[1:19:50] redeeming the time because we don't know
[1:19:53] how much time we have left.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; And I say, God, whatever time I got
[1:19:59] left, let me serve you with everything
[1:20:01] that I have within me. Lord, let me lay
[1:20:04] aside all my discouragement. Let me lay
[1:20:06] aside all my disappointments. Let me lay
[1:20:08] aside everything that would easily beset
[1:20:11] me and let me run this race. Let me run
[1:20:15] with all my heart. Not looking to the
[1:20:17] right or looking to the left or looking
[1:20:19] at this situation or that around or
[1:20:21] what's going on in the church or what
[1:20:22] ain't happening in the church.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Let me look at Jesus, the author and the
[1:20:27] finisher of my faith. And God, if my
[1:20:30] hope is in the wrong spot, move it back
[1:20:33] to your word.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Move it back to what you have for me and
[1:20:36] your plan and how you want to
[1:20:38] orchestrate your will in my life.
[1:20:41] Let's bow our hearts.
[1:20:50] I ask you to pray. Me and Sister Ruth
[1:20:53] were leaving in the morning, traveling
[1:20:55] to New Brunswick, be gone this weekend.
[1:20:59] into next week.
[1:21:01] Three services this weekend in a
[1:21:03] meeting. Ask the Lord to have his way to
[1:21:07] minister to hearts and his name be
[1:21:10] magnified.
[1:21:13] Really been on my burden to me on me
[1:21:16] about these meetings
[1:21:18] asking the Lord to move. So I know it's
[1:21:22] comforting to know I have a church
[1:21:23] praying for me.
[1:21:26] have believers surrounded me in prayer.
[1:21:30] But I wonder tonight,
[1:21:32] how many just
[1:21:36] want to just say, "Lord, the word's
[1:21:37] right.
[1:21:39] The word's right.
[1:21:43] Been focused on the disappointments,
[1:21:46] been focused on the wrong thing. But
[1:21:48] Lord, my hope's been in the wrong spots.
[1:21:52] Lord, I know all these things are
[1:21:53] working for my good. Even though I may
[1:21:56] not can see it right now,
[1:21:59] I know it's for my good.
[1:22:03] Even I may not have an answer. I don't
[1:22:05] know.
[1:22:08] Maybe right now as we think on these
[1:22:11] things, you kind of feel like you've
[1:22:13] been brought into a spot. You just feel
[1:22:16] the Lord walking by. Won't you just
[1:22:18] invite him just to come in for a moment,
[1:22:22] break some bread for you?
[1:22:26] Lord, I need a little nourishment.
[1:22:28] I need a little strength.
[1:22:33] I I I need you, Lord, just to come by my
[1:22:35] way. Would you invite him to your pew
[1:22:38] right now?
[1:22:41] Lord,
[1:22:43] come speak to me right now and just hold
[1:22:46] me for a moment.
[1:22:52] Yes, Lord.
[1:22:57] Yes, Lord.
[1:23:02] Yes, Lord.
[1:23:04] Been through a lot of disappointments,
[1:23:06] Brother Timothy.
[1:23:08] A lot of things I've deal with that I
[1:23:10] don't know the answers.
[1:23:14] You don't have to tell me about it. Tell
[1:23:15] God about it. Just say, "Lord,
[1:23:20] I'm sorry, Lord. I I maybe been looking
[1:23:22] for the wrong things for my happiness.
[1:23:30] Been looking for the wrong thing for my
[1:23:31] joy and what I think ought to bring
[1:23:33] satisfaction. But Lord, I I want to find
[1:23:35] joy in you tonight.
[1:23:38] Happiness and satisfaction in you.
[1:23:42] Granny Father, Lord Jesus,
[1:23:46] little simple thought tonight, Lord,
[1:23:47] you've had on my heart for a little
[1:23:49] while and just not knowing how things
[1:23:51] would go, would have happened, but Lord,
[1:23:54] we just leave it to you, Lord, to deal
[1:23:56] with hearts.
[1:23:58] And and to the individual to invite you
[1:24:01] into their little room, Lord, in their
[1:24:02] heart.
[1:24:04] Maybe they just need to open up another
[1:24:06] door.
[1:24:07] Let you in there for a moment. And Lord,
[1:24:10] just feel the squeeze of your spirit
[1:24:13] around their heart, Lord, as they find
[1:24:16] comfort in your word and you, Lord, and
[1:24:18] say, "Father,
[1:24:20] you're right.
[1:24:22] Your way is right, Lord. Your will is
[1:24:25] right, Lord.
[1:24:27] No matter what, Lord, I I'm going to
[1:24:29] love you. I'm going to serve you. I'm
[1:24:31] going to give you glory. I'm going to
[1:24:33] praise you. I want to thank you in the
[1:24:36] middle of my storm. I'm going to just
[1:24:38] give you all the glory and honor that
[1:24:40] bestowed you, Lord. I can bestow upon
[1:24:42] you. For the Father, you've been there
[1:24:45] for me every step of the way.
[1:24:48] Lord, forgive us, Lord, for dwelling on
[1:24:50] our disappointments in life.
[1:24:53] Disappointments of others or
[1:24:55] disappointments in our church or
[1:24:57] disappointments in men ministry.
[1:25:01] Lord, it's not all about that. that it's
[1:25:02] all about you.
[1:25:05] Move, Father. I pray in every heart.
[1:25:08] We love you today with everything that's
[1:25:10] in us
[1:25:12] in Jesus name.
[1:25:14] Go ahead, brother Andrew.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Your eyes
[1:25:23] upon Jesus.
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Upon Jesus.

[1:25:45] of this world

[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[1:26:06] Oh, turn
[1:26:10] your eyes
[1:26:12] upon me.
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Look fully
[1:26:21] in his wonderful
[1:26:25] face.
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:30] And the things
[1:26:33] of this world
[1:26:36] will grow strangeely
[1:26:40] dim
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; in the light
[1:26:45] of his glory
[1:26:48] and grace.
[1:26:50] Oh, turn your eyes.

[1:27:29] in the final
[1:27:32] of his glory
[1:27:36] and grace.
[1:27:41] and all that really
[1:27:45] counts
[1:27:49] and all that's really
