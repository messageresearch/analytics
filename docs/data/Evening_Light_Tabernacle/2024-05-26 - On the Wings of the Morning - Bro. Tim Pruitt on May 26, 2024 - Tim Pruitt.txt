the longing in your soul he knows it he not only knows it but he showed us in this day time after time with infallible proofs that he knew our names our address our situations our problems he also knew the solution to it and he's here today to manifest himself to you but you're going to have to come out of your shell and reach out to God you can't just sit there and withdrawn or pull back you're going to have to move out toward him extend a hand of Faith like I preached Sunday about reaching down for the for the job bone you're going to have to extend a a hand of faith and grab a hold of a promise amen he's got a promise for you this morning it's laying right there in front of you it's right for you just open up your heart to receive it now father as we bow our heads before your throne of grace we want to say thank you Lord that you're our helper in our time of need Lord you said that you would not leave us comfortless but you would come to us that you would comfort us in their times and Lord we're in a moment time that we need comforting by the Holy Spirit and we're looking to you Lord from the promises of the word today to receive of that Comfort there are those Lord that are not able to be with us today they're shut in or unable to travel sick at home got afflictions in their body they're looking to you today as we pray together for those that are in need like that that you would just reach out to them may they know that never fell in presence of Jesus Christ is with them and I I pray Lord for those present today that they would know that you're God you're God over their situation over their problem that they could reach out to you in faith and receive the promise for themselves Lord I ask that you would bring healing oh God May the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings today may you move back doubt and unbelief in the darkness of this of this age and cause Faith to rise to your promise Lord until their faith matches what the word of God says so that the word can be will work for them I ask in Jesus name that you will do it now Lord as we approach the word and we hold before us scriptures Lord an Open Bible this morning to look into the scripture to see our day our age Lord May that we oh God identify ourselves in the promise today so that we oh God can fulfill what has been written of us we're asking in the name of Jesus

that the coming of our savior draw not and he is coming soon he's coming soon we welcome his return it may be more it may be night or noon we know he's coming soon while we play that softly I want to read my scripture Psalms 139 and7 whe shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence if iend up to heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall the hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yay the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day and the Darkness and the light are both alike to thee God bless you you can be seated amen God bless you I'd like to take another scripture reading from 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 as we look look into the word and I'm going to focus especially on the last verse that I'm going to read um this morning as we look into this 1 Thessalonians 4:3 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then when we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words this morning I'm going to speak to you on a subject that as I was praying and contemplating for the services this today and um that just came to me as I as I was just in prayer and the scripture where he said says here if I take the wings of the morning and I'm going to speak to you this morning on that subject on the wings of the morning now we have read also from the words of Paul where he left a word of comfort and of course the psalmist David here is speaking of words that you know of of where can we go from your presence the wherever we are you are there because he has made us a promise I will never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you even to the end of the world this is a promise given to us as Believers and the psalmist speaks of the wings of the morning those first rays of light that come with the Dawn and it seems like sometimes for us who may be wrestled during the night that ESP especially maybe if you're dead asleep maybe you don't notice the night but for those that are sometimes are watching the clock and seeing the hours pass and and you're you know you're disturbed during the night it seems like that night will never end and for some of us we can't wait for the Dawn and we you know we yearn for it we sing of it and you know songs have been written by by when the morning comes when all the saints of God are gathered home we we sing of that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ arise and the glory of his resurrection share and when his Chosen One Shall Gather to their home beyond the skies when the role is CAU up yonder I'll be there you see it is the hope of the ages and and that some golden Daybreak Jesus will come and and of course it is for for the world that we're living in as darkness is entering in and and things are getting progressively worse and worse upon upon the world that we live in that and and yet mankind looks and they're expecting even themselves a a new era that is Dawning and they are telling us that things will are happening that will change the world as we know it artificial intelligence is here and many of course fear that that it's going to destroy human life you know just recently United States uh completed the first dog fight between uh AI controlled F-16 and the human pilot our own um Air Force secretary Frank Kendall flew in a AI controlled F-16 just a few weeks ago that matched up well against experienced human pilots in dog fights and he never touched a control and with artificial intelligence and automation driverless cars are on the road that have now driven over you know um 20 million miles and so you know we we we're living in a day where things are rapidly changing and and of course if it was progressing toward a better more gentler more Kinder world it would be maybe wonderful but that's not where is advancing to with it comes is more evil than ever but I I thought about you know the intelligence as they look for artificial intelligence I thought about how that 91 years ago God's intelligence through a prophetic eye by Vision saw a driver's car described as shaped like an egg so it's aerodynamic and and that's a new world word that has been invented I don't know Michael if you I sent you some pictures I don't know I forgot to tell you to have them ready for me but you know if you know they they have the the driverless cars that was going down the road and one was seen the other day in menen um you know we have the as I said the the weo car the autonomous car is now clocked over 20 million miles of of real driving real world Driving Experience through countless situation it's the equivalent of driving to the Moon and Back 40 times and so you know we we have advancement in in science and we have God's intelligence telling us a long time ago that this was coming and that we have now ared that we are now at the time where uh prophecy is being fulfilled as brother brandom had the seven continuous visions and one of them was the progression of science would that there would be automation um like this and so we know that the bride of Christ is also going beyond the wisdom of man the the and by the way that was the Google card that I was showing you there um that that is also there not just the wayo but the the Google car and so you know they they have all kinds of designs and aerodynamic ways to to promote this and and many of them describes the vision that brother brandham uh had almost perfectly and so but yet you know we talk about the body of Christ we also have received a intelligence a great intelligence that comes as we see the night ending and a New Day Dawning and the approaching of of Christ and and so brother Bram told us this that he said see down to the age we started out from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed and then come out through the feet Luther back then through Wesley then to Pentecost to tongues and in the lips and now it's in the eyes the prophetic of Malachi 4 and now there's nothing left for it but for him himself to step into that because that's the last thing the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee these things he can't do it it's God himself and it's com into a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam was at the beginning see you he says he goes on he says the next intelligence is Christ himself who controls the whole body so we come as he was talking about from the feet from Luther and and and through the body through Wesley and then the the lips and tongue through Pentecost and now the prophetic eye through Malachi 4 and now here all is left is just for the intelligence of Christ to come down down into the body amen Christ is here in his intelligence and that's why that he could tell us with with astounding accurate discernment you know the the names the addresses the the the the conditions foretelling the future um telling of the past go 40 years back in somebody's life there were other gifted men and maybe they were 80% sometimes uh uh on other times off and but this intelligence was God using a man through a prophetic voice showing us that the complete word is here and and those that are familiar with um artificial intelligence tell us that the power grids that we have today will not supply the need for the energy required for the artificial intelligence that is going to take a a huge boost in our energy sector and and of course economics are recommending you know stocks in different um areas you know to to to get ready for this advancement in science but I want to say about our intelligence that we have received it comes with a an energy supply of the fullness of the Holy Ghost and it's Dynamic working power so it's not something separate that we need it is what we need for this hour and of course we we've seen that it was quickening power that came and opened up the Seven Seals and I'm quoting from it is the rising of the Sun and he said what was that the intelligence of of a man no it was the quickening power of God and and so it was God that came and made us know exactly what these truths was for this end time that we're living in and that is because because there is a there is a coming an end to the church ages as we know it there's coming an end to the darkness that is of this world Amen there is coming there of a of a great power that is rising this intelligence tells us that there is a woman rising and this woman is the Bride of Jesus Christ and she will rise in power and in demonstration and she's here now upon the Earth amen we are we are seeing it we are we are experiencing it but this also intelligence told us that a foretold of a woman rising through the popular vote of a woman of women who would either be vice president or president but a woman of great power perhaps he said the Catholic church he would hold America in her complete Sway and this Vision described her in Royal purple and and here she is in Royal Purple right at her own inauguration there and it was described in the magazines and everything especially made in Royal Purple for this occasion and brother brandham said this in in the 70th week of Daniel he said that brings us then to the election of President Kennedy and this car is coming on the scene brings five things out of the seven and now I predicted I saw a great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed in High royal highly Royals like purple and I got little parentheses down there she was a great ruler in the United States perhaps the Catholic Church a woman some woman I don't know her to be the Catholic church I don't know I can't say only thing I saw the woman that was all and I tell you in this election we got both the woman as vice president and the Catholic church we have in office the first Catholic President since Kennedy to hold office now I want you to remember what he told us this this woman and we're not just talking about this woman here but we're talking about the administration and what is behind it we I want you I want you to listen carefully to what he said would happen she will leave the nation to pollution I'm just quoting this Administration has had gay and transgender celebrations in the White House advancing their cause more than any other Administration they boast now that roughly 15% of all appointees identify themselves as lesbian gay bisexual trans transgender and queer they have the Pete Buddha is the first openly gay Senate confirmed cabinet secretary in the United States as our transportation secretary and and of course under this Administration the very things that Clinton said was wrong a liberal who said it would never be he signed into law same-sex marriages this is all the pollution and man as and and let me quote she will guide or lead this nation to ruination now we have a national debt that is over 35 trillion now we that means that every living breathing American automatically if you have a baby just born that baby owes already over $100,000 in debt you have a family of five you have a half a million that you owe as an American citizen so she will lead or guide this nation to R Nation she held her people in her complete power and this Administration does what it wants if the Supreme Court says it cannot forgive student loans this Administration does it anyway you know what they circumvent laws and have flooded country with 7 million illegals or more who are now they're given voting rights to is opened our borders to Palestinians inviting them to come into our country who not only hate Israel but hate America and we have the nation of Israel is under attack World courts and World opinion is against her and I want you to remember the battle that she is in and the battle you are in is more than a physical battle it is a spiritual battle and so she she is definitely the burdensome stone that is spoke of in zechariah's Prophecy Zechariah 12:3 and in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all all the people of the earth be gathered together against it that's Zechariah 12:3 so you see here's a condition that we're in the whole world this is the burdensome Stone you know again they can be attacked there the women raped and and and young people murdered and everything else but it's always Israel's fault they are the aggressor they are the they are the one in the wrong they're the they're the one that you know and they can give them land and and as I said again there is no such thing as a Palestinian country there's a country of Israel Palestinians are Arabs amen and they and they don't even belong there but they give them rights and they give them voting rights and they give them they welcome them and to to live there but they will not live there peaceably and the world wants them Co totally destroyed from The River To The Sea because this is the same Spirit of the Antichrist that is against the bride of Christ and I'll tell you if it wasn't for Grace you would go through the tribulation but God promised a Rapture in this AG he promised an escape amen from the things that are coming upon the Earth and he told you to pray always Amen to to that you would escape the things that are coming upon the Earth and be a accounted worthy to stand before the son of man I'll tell you what if you'll let the son of man the word judge you now you will not have to be judged otherwise you'll go through the tribulation for purging there's a wise and there's a foolish virgin I say it's foolish to turn down the opportunities that we have and miss the great Rapture of the church now man of course has got into God's laboratory and here's the plague I want you to read it from Zechariah 14:12 Zechariah 14:12 says and this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will Smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem their flesh shall consume away while they stand up on their feet and their tongues or their eyes shall consume away in their holes and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth we could actually turn to Revelation 13 and we could show where the Beast or the image of the Beast has great power to bring fire down from heaven you see we are here we are here and this intelligence it's not an artificial intelligence it's a prophetic voice that has spoke to us in this day and this intelligence has already shown uh smoke and bombs and craters all over the land of America as far as I'm concerned you can get ready to leave amen cuz there is no other hope there is no other refuge and there is no other strength that the this intelligence admonished us to watch Russia watch Russia keep your eyes on the King of the North Daniel's Vision shows us um that the iron and the clay will not mix you know that we have we have today Russia and China and Iran and Arabs that are joining together in a coalition and America and her allies joining together and the Bible said they will not mix it is in this stage after the Gentile kingdoms coming down from Babylon if you remember what I'm referring to is that there was a a a an image that Nebuchadnezzar saw and he saw it with a head of gold and then it had the arms and and chest of of of brass or or silver rather and then come down to to brass and in the in the loins and came on down into the feet and legs as iron and then when it gets to the end of the kingdoms it is iron and Clay so it is it is the mix so you see it came down from as Daniel uh interpreted he said you're the head of gold the Babylonian Kingdom there's coming another which is going to be the mes and the Persian after that he prophesies this is this is not artificial intelligence this is God's intelligence and it's given to a prophetic voice and the proph IC voice said it'll go from the mes and the Persian to the Grecian Empire and from that to the Romans and then come right on down into the iron and the clay and we're here we have arrived so the kingdoms are divided of this world and they're against each other and they will not mix but Daniel saw in the vision he saw more than that he saw a stone without hands come there and smite the feet of that image and it crumbled together and fall down and built then was a great mountain of the Lord from where God Reigns upon the Earth there is a millennium coming the kingdoms of this world will be the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ this is the promise that is given and this is the intelligence we have received y the book holds many wonderful truths and Revelations and Promises of the time of Darkness that one day it'll soon be over but sometimes we ask when will morning come right now it's still dark it's so very dark even the Book of Revelation shows the Gentile ages are nighttime did you ever notice there are symbolic scenes there of seven stars in the hand of Jehovah there are are in the hand of Jesus who is the Jehovah of the Old Testament and there are lampstands seven golden lampstands these are not used in the daytime these are used at night and this night because Christ has left the Earth and so you see again it seems sometimes that morning will never come you see the seventh Church age was supposed to be the shortest age is now exceeded the first church age by a year if I could say it this way the messenger left when he was but 56 years of age and has now been gone 58 years two years longer than what he was even alive you see again we ask the question when will morning come because we see the world is getting darker and darker and and Peter told us of a habener to his coming and it would be that there would be a time of delay that would make a way for scoffers to come and they would Express doubt and in that time people would lose faith and remember this is this is what Jesus said when I come will I find Faith he didn't ask if he would find churches or Assemblies of people or people who sang and worship he wanted to find Faith somebody that believed him and we look here at this so the ABG to his coming one of the signs will be as it spoke of in 2 Peter 3 and verse three know knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scuffers walking after their own lust saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation so you see because that you know Jesus wasn't coming back as they thought it was even even they were beginning to ask him questions and and even Paul said now concerning the things you have written me about you know concerning the those that are dead in Christ and he reassures whoever dies God will bring with them that they're not left out but we which are alive and remain and he speaks of them that will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Paul tells us many many things about the coming of the Lord he tells us more about heaven than any of the other Apostles he would visit the you know into the Third Realm Of Heaven and he said I I I saw things that are are are are just too holy to be uttered and and yet he would let out little secrets you know we will not all sleep but we will all be changed and and he would tell us you know about how our what our mortal body would be like and different he had visited that realm and he was able to come back and tell us by an intelligence that was beyond Plato and Beyond the you know the the great man of the time and be able to tell them things that they didn't know at all because he had visited that realm and came back and said you know you know this this is the way that heaven is going to be you know the this house that you have you it's going to be changed and you're going to be clothed upon with a new body and he goes and describes every all kinds of things that are in that Heavenly Place John would be able to see it also and tell us of things that he saw in that realm all by a Divine intelligence but you know because of of the delay it gives a occasions to scuffers and and and I'll just tell you it's even hard on us as Believers and I I thought about it you know that you know as I was writing to church you know sometimes as we we look and we hear of things that God says and and and he speaks to us just recently I had a dream and I had a I had a dream and in this dream I I I I went into into heaven and as I went in there I a man I call him a man an angel came with the records and he opened up the records and he looked and he said and he saw me and he looked back at me and saw my something written in the book and he said it is not your time to come here you must go back but you must rest more and I thought about that what in the world does that mean I must rest so you know I took off to the cabin for a couple of days three or four days and I just rested I said well I was told to rest so I'll just go and I'll just rest for a couple of days and I sat there and watch the waves come in and the breeze blow and things like that and you know just contemplating on what I was told to do and and then as I was coming to church this morning morning I begin to realize it's not physical rest but it's resting on the promise it's looking there at what God Said and resting on it and knowing he'll never fail heavens and earth may pass away but his word never fails never never never will it fail and if there's anything we must do in this hour is enter into rest whatever don't get anxious don't get worried don't become fearful and Afraid rest God's got this if you can only realize that in your situation whether you're battling cancer whether youve had a bad past whether where you've been abused or mistreated if you just stop this for a moment and begin to rest in the promise and say yes God knew all about this and this is a path that he has used to bring me to God but oh Lord let me rest in your promise let me not strive against your will and where you happy in my life but let me rest but as a said sometimes as we waiting for morning to come we it gives occasion to scoffers and it's actually hard on Believers I I visited with Brother Gary and Sister Barbara stanky down in Manny this week they've been coming up to church here since 1998 been faithful to the Lord he was a young man of 24 years of age when he embraced the message and he was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Sister Barbara was 22 she'd been witnessed to by her mother her mother was Sister gladus McGary and although she and brother Gary had been in brother Brandon's meetings and witnessed and and as they sat there talking Brother Gary tried to T tried to describe the awesome and Indescribable presence of the angel of God as it went out over the audience and called out people by name and their addresses and their situations and told them and and he said I I I can't even put into words of that presence and you know um sister Barbara's mother you know came to to know the message witness to to them and and Sister Barbara became came to realize there was a message of restoration and she didn't know if her husband Brother Gary would receive it or not Brother Gary was very involved in his uncle's Assembly of God Church and you may not know it but he was born in Canada and if I understood right they immigrated into America and came to Missouri there and worked at a a certain School his mother and dad had to have employment to be able to come in to the country and you know he was he was there as a young boy in the in the meetings in in um brother Brandon's meetings and there a young boy he had had a pencil or something HD his eye there and blinded it and and he had trouble with that eye and and there his mother had a huge Gorder a huge Gorder that was there that was very noticeable and huge there on her on her throat and and um you know in the in the meeting there as the spirit of God moved she was called out and was told you know that she had this Gorder and she you know to believe and and receive and and and there the Gorder just disappeared and brother Gary was prayed for in that meeting there and and there was at least a partial restoration to his eye were things were were much much better but nevertheless as he being a young man now in in this Assembly of God Church he had positions and places head of head of different organizations there that they that they relied upon him was a song leader and he was there singing the song leading a song one morning I'll Fly Away some glad morning when this life is over I'll F away and he got to that part like a bird from prison bars have flown and as he did he heard the voice of God speak to him and said it's time to leave and he left family friends everything and embraced the message of the hour and was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for 60 faithful years since he's heard the message he has looked for the coming of the Lord now he's 84 years of age I mean he's still I would like to say looking at the wings of the morning looking at the signs of the approaching sun and I you know you can feel it in our hearts and it's saying hurry up son amen hurry up you know my my time is here upon the Earth is about up and I'm hearing the sounds of the and the spirits of darkness and we're asking why is all the delay how come we continue to wait what Peter explained the delay he said first people are are willingly ignorant that God made the world and it belongs to God in other words that this is God's world and Satan will not rule here forever and so in Psalms 24 And1 said the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell there in for he has founded upon the sea and established it upon the floods but right now Satan rules upon it but it belongs to God he's just a squatter Satanist and God will redeem it and he will live upon it with his people and I'll just tell you by Divine intelligence from the Bible the word of God Satan's Reign cannot continue forever in second Peter 3 and 3 I I I just I'm going to read a translation but you can read along but most importantly he said I want to remind you that in the last days scoffers will come mocking the truth and following their own desires second Peter 3 and verse4 and they will say what happened to the promise that Jesus is coming again for before the times of our ancestors everything has remained the same since the world was first created and then he said they deliberately forget that God made the heavens Long Ago by the word of his command and he brought the Earth out of the water out from the water and surrounded it with water and then he used the water to destroy the ancient world with a mighty flood and then by the same word the present heavens and the Earth has been sored up for fire and they are being kept for the day of judgment when ungodly people will be destroyed but you must not forget this one thing dear friends a day is like a thousand years to the Lord and a thousand years like a day the Lord isn't really slow about his promise as some people think no he is patient for your sake he does not want anyone to be destroyed but he wants everyone to repent but the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief then to heavens and and we'll pass away with a terrible noise and their very elements themselves would dis disappear in Fire and the Earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment now as we're thinking of this what an age that we're living in what other age could the world be burned over by fire what other age could we be destroyed many times over with the arsenals that are that countries like America and Russia and others have many times over never has there ever been a time that we are we're so close to the burning now we we know that God red you know this Earth is the Lords and and it is a Fallen Earth when it when man fell the Earth fell with him and so sin began to rain and and of course Peace was gone before then it was like a millennium the the lion ate straw like the Bullock and and the Bible tells you that the lion would laid down by the like a lamb or with the lamb as as it will in the millennial Reign why why why does he speak of that because that's the way it was before the fall were that these words were so true nothing shall hurt or destroy in all of my Holy Mountain these are the intelligence of God this is the way the world was sometimes people look at their situations and they wonder why did God do this to me why did God let this happen if he's God how come this happened in my life what why am I suffering the way I did why did people abuse me why did bad things happen to me well I'll just tell you this is not the Millennium this is a time where sins rain and it wasn't originally that way when God made the Earth it was all perfect there was no sin when God was King over the Earth man there was no there was no filth there was no adulter there was no sin there was no no murders there was nothing hurt but when man chose between knowledge the knowledge the intelligence the knowledge between good and evil that everything that we have that is good evil comes with it it's a world with with a mixture and so therefore awful things happen because Satan is right now The Prince and the power of the air and he rules people and he gets into people and people hurt other people ruin other people's lives why couldn't God just stop it he will but because man chose this he has allowed men to live in temporary bodies but he puts an expiration date on everybody that is born in the world that you canot live here forever one day you're going to make an exit from this world just as you made an entrance into this world and this is only the preparation grounds and it's your opportunity and it's your time to choose because now you're on the same basis that Adam and Eve was choose life or knowledge choose Satan and Hell or choose God and Heaven and just let me make you something clear we sang the song this morning this world is not my home and that's true of this Cosmos but this Earth is our home whoever goes to heaven is only going there for a temporary time they will come back to live here upon this earth the earth is something that belongs to God and he redeems it he redeems it as he did in the days of Noah he flooded the world with water washed it clean he baptized it and then 2,000 years later or so here he here comes Jesus and he sheds his blood upon it right and then the last part of it to make a new Earth or to make a new heavens and new earth it will come out of being born out of fire so there will be the water the blood and the fire I mean it's exactly the steps of the birth water blood and spirit and God does the same thing with you and your new birth you you come through the water through repentance and through the blood by sanctification and then you come to receive the very Spirit of the Living God where he comes to live on you because by the way what God is doing when he redeems your soul he is also and your body for the resurrection but when Jesus went away two angels came and spoke with him and with some perhaps some of the 500 who saw him after his res Resurrection as the Bible said in 1 Corinthians 15 and6 that he was seen of above 500 Brethren at once and yet the Bible tells tells you that as he was leaving giving his last instructions while they beheld him he was taken up and a cloud received him out of his sight out of their sight and the Bible tells you in Acts 1:1 that two men stood by them in white apparel which said ye men of Galilee why stand you gazing up into the heaven this same Jesus which was taken up from you you into heaven shall come so come in like manner as you've seen him go into heaven I think if I was standing present there and haven't heard the angels speak I I would believe that I would see that in my lifetime but instead of coming back immediately as promised the Bible tell told you in Mark 16 for example and Mark 16 tells you that instead of coming immediately back his promise he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high and there became the intercessor between God and sinful man so this is why that Peter would say wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such thing be diligent that you f be found in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of God is salvation and I want you to think of just that just for a moment because even when the word was given to to Noah it's going to rain build an ark make preparation it would be 120 years later amen and yet while the Bible said it was the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing so God making preparation allowed a time of longsuffering and I I want you to think about it be as we look at it this morning why did he come back then because had he came back we have would not be here his longsuffering has allowed many whose names were on the Lamb's Book of Life to be manifested on the earth and this is why that I I bring the scripture in in Hebrews 10 and 35 Hebrews 10:35 cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward whatever you do don't lose confidence in the promise don't cast it away it has great recomend Pense of reward I'm going to tell you even without a heaven even if there is no Rapture if our life to sins as death and nothingness the way of a Christian Life Is A Better Way the way of God uniting a man and a woman together under the under the dictates of marriage and binding them together and raising children raising up home and raising things right is a better way the the the the the words of the Bible of of of The Commandments of God of thou shall not steal or bear false with all of those are a better way but here he said cast not away your confidence that has a great recompense of reward I I'm just telling you the Christian life has a has great Rec Pense of reward even if without heaven but Heaven of course will be a greater reward and we look forward that but he said you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise so what should you seek in your life today God let me find your will you've got a purpose and you've got a plan and I'm not here by accident but your longsuffering has allowed me to be here because my name was in the Lamb's Book of Life now let me find your will for my life and walk in that for yet a little while he said and he that shall come will come and will not t now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him so he warns you don't put your hand on the plow and look back my soul has no pleasure in them that draw back but the just shall live by faith faith God I don't understand but I'm taking another step that's right I don't understand life situations but I'm making I'm going forward not backwards many times we're standing at a Red Sea moment and here we are surrounded in every way but it's a moment that you just go forward knowing that God's going to open the way knowing that he made a promise and he told us not to draw back so we'll not go back into Egypt we'll not go back in the world but we'll go forward even if we don't understand how it will open when we don't understand exactly how or where to put our foot but we just make up a a step forward because we got to go through I'm going through Jesus yes I'm going [Applause] through verse 12 of Peter 3 that we have been reading I want to just read this because he says as you wait for the day of God do your best or do your part to make it come soon the day when the heavens will burn up and be destroyed and the heavenly bodies will be melted by the heat but as you wait for the day of God do your best to make it come soon now I know we have many anxious hearts and the delay is so frustrating and upsetting but there's always been a delay always and we get impatient for the night to be over it seem like the longer we wait and the further we go along the more difficult is the delay however we are living in the Fulfillment of the word of God let to take off my coat I want to just press some things to your heart this morning if I can cuz we're living in the Fulfillment of the word of God after a long delay of 2,000 years for it is in this age that many scriptures and all tipes and shadows are fulfilled now you you don't realize it but things can walk along a long time and seem like nothing has happening and all of a sudden things change you know as it was in the days of Noah the Bible said you know as Peter spoke said while the ark Was preparing while things were getting made ready for that great climatic change that was going to happen and I can imagine every day just seemed like a another day there was no rain there was no clouds there were no Thunders there were no warnings other than a prophet's Voice who gave a Divine intelligence and warned there's a deluge coming something they had never seen and the day the Deluge began it was probably the sun started out shining probably like any other day sometimes I wonder even in some ways if the Rapture won't be that way just seem like another day as usual sometimes you think well this is going to happen I can be prayed up and this can has going to happen and I can be ready and you know maybe in 30 or 40 days I can I can get things in order in my life and and whatever and it'll be like another day the Bible say de like a thief unexpectedly so the Bible prophesies of the end time he speaks of the com of the Lord and the time of the process of fulfillment and and it looks like a delay that things are just continuing like they've always done and when it happens it's mocked amen just like in the days of Noah you know you you idiot you've been preaching this 120 years you've been building on this you've been you've been saying this is going to happen nothing's happened yet we've given our life we've we've had work on the ark we we've gave labor we did this you know halfway Believers brother brandom said you know stood around the ark saying you know maybe the old Prophet might be right maybe there might be something to this m message so they just kind of halfway Believers just kind of stood around waiting watching I I'll get in I'll get in and they didn't realize the ark that was being made had no room for them the ark you're building has to have room and it's got to be a god- constructed Arc in Peter's Second Epistle he tells you of this apparent delay and well you know what would be the attitude of people in this time that since it appeared that the Lord wasn't coming back like he said that men who once walk with God would begin to walk in their own lust you might ask me this morning and wonder so well brother Tim can you tell tell us can you tell us what time it is or where are we in time and uh well this is 2024 no where are we in Bible prophecy where are we in scripture and I tell you that's why that I have been preaching of search the scripture because it testify of you and of this day and I just want to say God is always right on time and that there's nothing out of order even though like with the three Hebrew children he might wait until you thrown in the fire but he'll be there amen you may be like Daniel in the Lion's Den but he's right there on time but we have so much that God has done in this age and yet we still don't see total fulfillment and you can see how he's worked though up to end time events and searching the scriptures you can see the types of the Bible whether it be of women such as Ruth or Rahab or Esther or the Virgin Mary or men like Enoch or Abraham or Moses with the Exodus or Joshua with the plac into the Heritage every one of them are pointing to this hour every one of them is God's voice showing you in the scripture Divine intelligence of the end time and the end time process we can actually spend hour on it like I did Sunday on just on Samson I took two hours showing the types and didn't do it justice but but you know somewhere there there is that people that nazarites that are separated and chosen amen who the as a type shows that though the church is tray though it's been seduced by Harlot churches though it's had a power shaved off in its final moments will have regrown those Seven Locks and come back to Covenant with God as a restored people a restored bride with the mightiest victory over death Hell In The Grave it's prophesied right in the scripture that's Divine intelligence brother Bram said in the message what shall we do with Jesus this Jesus called Christ he said listen we say about Satan's big machine up there ready to move that's right to crush down but remember God's Little Flock that believes the word its mechanics is ready too it's ready for the Dynamics to set it a fire with the Holy Ghost fear not little flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the kingdom the Holy Ghost will strike a little church that's come out of the world women that wears long hair nazarit to prove their separated themselves from the world each one of those lives like samsons were prophesying in this day because it's not just an event in history it's not just a fictitional character but their lives were prophesying of our day as I've explained to you and this is why Jesus would say as Jonah was in the belly of the whale he looked right there and saw himself in Jonah not as Australian Prophet but as one who would go into the belly of the well and come out in 3 days that he saw the son of man would also go down in the heart of of the earth and rise again and he saw his resurrection prophesied right there in Jonah's life and I'll tell you what where we're living at this time friends there's really a lot of things that are happening there's been a rapid I'm talking about a rapid fulfillment of scriptures in this day as a Leo de se an age is the age of the quick short work there have been so many things that have happened and are happening and it's been after a delay of 2,000 years I'm talking about seven Gentile Church ages where we have seen the scriptures actually come alive there's been a rapid fulfillment of Prophecy and we could say about most of the scripture this day this scripture is fulfilled if we looked at a scripture that laid dormant for thousands of years where he said behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord we can stand here today and say this day this scripture is fulfilled I'm looking at men and women who can identify with Joel's prophecy I'll pour out my spirit in the last day amen upon my sons and upon my daughters and they shall prophesy amen I'm talking about you today and we can say in many respect many scriptures manful scriptures this day this scripture has been fulfilled what an hour we're living in is a climatic time you're living at in the end of the Bible yeah a prophetic eye went back and told us what happened in the verse of the Bible come on Amen and then Trace that serpent all the way down to the scripture and here Trail him all the way down to the end to the end age is that right amen a prophetic insight has given us this is God's intelligence to this last age are you with me amen now so you see but we we not in the front of the scripture we're at the end of the scripture we're actually and I'll bring it out in a moment maybe but we're right here in the scripture or the last prayer of the Bible even so come Lord Jesus because that prayer will be answered in this day for a group of people who are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord and you're living there and you are writing the last acts before the Rapture you are a continuation of the books of Act of the book of Acts not a new book of Acts we are not writing a new book of Acts as if it's another book of Acts another that you know something unlike with the first what was in the first church is in the last Church it is a continuation of the same Ministry of the Holy Spirit working the same way in the people in the last day amen so you are here at the end of the Bible writing the last a before the Rapture every promise that spoke of the Bible or or the bride rather is being fulfilled in this hour and it's in this hour that God has done and I don't like to put it in the past but is doing Mighty things as he winds up the events that has to do with the coming of the Lord Jesus and it parallels his first coming as as Jesus of Galilee where the scriptures were being fulfilled it was you know when Jesus came it had been a long delay of 500 years that's just twice as long as America has been a nation but I want you to think if you'll look over here and open up your Bible turn over here to the Book of Malachi and and Matthew and look right here and you're holding right here from where he says I will come and smite the Earth with a curse period and start right here the book of the generation of Jesus Christ 500 years not a prophet not a word from God a lot of things were happening but from Malachi to Jesus silence look like nothing was happening yet everything was getting in place kingdoms was coming and getting in place the great Beast that was rising up that old that old serpent coming up out of Rome that we could read in Revelations chapter 12 where that where he sees you know that a woman standing there uh there with the moon at her feet and at her head where were 12 stars and it's Israel there and and there the law the Moon is a is a symbol of of the law of of good things to come and here she is there and she's about to give birth and at that moment a red dragon's on the scene so Israel is about to give birth to Messiah to a Manchild who will be rejected and caught up into heaven it's shown in the vision it's shown in Divine intelligence is somebody with me amen and there in in in that time here things are being prepared being prepared for the Messiah to come but it looks like nothing's happening and so from Malachi to John the Baptist there's not another prophecy not another word and then all of a sudden suddenly suddenly suddenly things change I I want to get that word to you suddenly suddenly things can change the Bible talks about his coming and associated with it in the hour you think not suddenly when you're least expected and here you got a man standing up you know he's got a wife that is Barren and he's bar then they ain't had a child and they're up in age and it's you know all these prayers have went on for years and years and years my my wife give us a child Lord give us a child and there and there on the outside Israel is praying oh God the Roman pow is is is is so brutal send the Messiah Lord send the Messiah and they're praying for the Messiah they're praying for the coming of the of that Messiah God send him and an angel appears out of nowhere an angel walks in as he's offering the incense sent from the presence of God said Zachariah you're going to have a child I'm answering your prayers as you have offered up this incense that has been going up now for hundreds of times I am now going to pray answer the prayers that you pray and it's now the time yeah you're old look like hope is gone you've been impatient and now you think it's impossible but I'm going to do it and this child is going to be a Nazarite he's not going to drink wine he's not he's going to be separated he's going to be surrendered to me and he's going to prepare the way before the Messiah and then from there you know right after that here here we have uh just within six months of there here comes a the angel of God Gabriel appears to Mary sisters don't think God can't appear to you angels can the first occurrence in the Bible was to a woman of an angel coming with a woman by the name of Hagar who was not even in the Covenant and whose child was wouldn't even be in the Covenant but God cared about him and if God cares about that amen a woman who's not even in the Covenant an Egyptian who's not even in the abrahamic Covenant whatsoever and the angel God Appears he'll appear to you if I can say it to you this morning you the woman the church can have an Angelic visitation from the almighty amen he's he's still God and he still does that he would appear to Paul he would appear to Phillip he would appear to Mary he would appear to those at the tomb he would appear again and again and again in the New Testament and he still that new testament God live your life where the angel can appear he can appear in this service this morning and we ought to expect him we got too much prophecy not to expect him here he comes and this wonderful glorious visitation comes then a word from God at his at his dedication Jesus dedication and then for 30 years you hear nothing it all goes silent looks like what of it nothing's happening SCS what he's going to be a mighty Prophet what this is going to be the Messiah this is this is this is a child that is born and and and the son is given and his name should be called I don't see nothing wonderful about him and then all of a sudden we hear of a man preaching down on the I started to say Ohio River but preaching right down on the River Jordan and there as he's preaching there he said he says now you know I I'm I'm not him but I've sent been sent to prepare the way for me I I'm I'm going to make the past trit I'm going to pull down the the high heels of man's exalted thoughts and the ions and I'm going to lift up neglected truth and I'm going to make the way prepared for the Messiah to come he's going to be here he's G he's going to be here he's he's going to be on the scene we're looking for him at any moment amen the spirit of God spoke to me and said that that the one I saw the Spirit descend upon and remain I would know that was the Messiah and one day he's preaching about it and out walks in the water a man my cousin this is rigged this is rigged Jesus him but as he's standing there he realizes something Supernatural going on and he sees the heavens open and and the dove come down and come and feel him and abide in him and he said this is him that I I preached about that would come this is the Messiah and for three and a half years of Mighty Ministry great things happened Miracle after Miracle uh prayer lines and Miracle lines and healings and blind eyes open Dead rais death here all kinds of things happen leopards are cleared everything the gospel is preached word like never before you know here again Moses said but I say unto you and here he comes with thus sayith the Lord a word from heaven and word after word and scripture after scripture is being fulfilled and they got their eyes on the wrong coming so they try to make him the king he says I was born to be a king but not what you're trying to make me I've come to fulfill Isaiah 53 he was wounded for my transgression he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes I am healed I've come to do that I've come as a Shepherd to give my life for the Sheep I've come for Redemption see there's a greater thing than making Israel a great nation with a mighty king the Great great thing is redemption and then then all of a sudden their hope is crucified and they're sad and they're discouraged and Peter says I'm just going to go fishing I'll just go back to my old lifestyle you know I've k G my life three and 1/2 years and walk and followed this man helped him in prayer lines I thought he was the Messiah and now you know he's disillusioned everything else that I just go fishing but Jesus wouldn't leave him there and Jesus is not going to leave you in your discouragement in your doubt in your unbelief because you misunderstand what he's doing in the age do you hear me amen he'll come whatever he has to do amen he'll make bread and Fish on the fire without ever catching a fish or making a fire he just by Spoken Word create and have cook fish that's this is our God and he'll show himself and he said now listen Peter said you've got to get to Jerusalem this is what I want you to do you've got to wait in Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high because I'm coming again but I'm not coming in the way that you think I'm coming I'm coming in the form of the Holy Ghost to give you power Hallelujah to give you power over that temper to give you power over that doubting oh man power over that unbelief I'm going to give you power amen that in my name you will cast out devils in my name you'll see salvation upon the elect and people set free in my name and two are going on the road to amas and they're they're all discouraged and they're down and hard but he cannot leave them there he's got to get them in the right place I'm trying to tell you this is God will do whatever it takes to get his elect you might be sitting here today downcast and discouraged and in unbelief and doubt and all kind of evil things has happened to you but I'm telling you there's someone coming walking right beside you saying why are you so sad why are you so sad there's there's so many scriptures being fulfilled why are you disillusioned how come you throw away your hope how come you you Cast Away your confidence why is it you're going the wrong direction head back toward Pentecost get back toward the upper room amen I'm not going to keep let you walk the wrong direction I am here to turn you around and set you on the right path you might be discouraged you might be full of unbelief you might be a DAT you might be a scoffer you might be a skeptic but if your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world he will seek his own he'll not lose a one and his longsuffering he'll go after you and goodness and mercy will get on your [Applause] Trail say why is this happened to me well I say you cuz it might be because goodness and mercy is on your Trail I can't see goodness in this it is God getting you into a place where you can say I know my redeemer lives I say again in this day we've seen scripture come alive we've seen a rapid fulfillment of Prophecy scriptures that seem dead life have sprung to life it's in this generation God's done Mighty things as he winds up end time events and we have arrived at the scripture that I read this morning as the morning Dawns as the wings of the morning come we've arrived at this place of comfort 1 Thessalonians 4 and the Rapture cycle has begun the Rapture cycle is a succession of events that will finalize with his Corporal coming yes we believe in his Corporal coming We believe We believe that Jesus Christ will come physically again we will meet him in the air I don't understand all about air and all about Dimensions but I know we'll meet him there now as we're saying this we do believe because that's what Believers believe we believe there's a literal Lord Jesus coming from Heaven a physical Lord Jesus who we will meet in the air Believers believe that amen unbelievers don't but we do now and no matter how much you spiritualize it it still must final finalize in the physical Corporal return of Jesus Christ that's right or it's all in vain it's all Air Castles smoking mirrors Jesus has to come back his word said so so I don't know well Divine intelligence told us so well I don't understand Divine intelligence well you probably don't understand artificial intelligence but it ain't an understanding it's knowing what God said he will do that he's going to fulfill his word now as we're looking at this the Bible tells you clearly of this Rapture cycle and brother bam tells us he does three things as he descends and I'm re referring to brother Brandon because that is where Divine intelligence came from a prophetic voice a prophetic insight and we have arrived where the Lord himself has descended from heaven with a shout and that shout is a mighty message it is can I say it this way it is the presence of Christ in word form now it's not as physical coming but still it's his coming and it's in word form and it has been sounded and continues to Echo even to this day into every corner of the world and this message do not stopped progressing it do not stopped reaching out into dark Corners to the of the globe it it continues as we speak to reach out to the predestined seeds to of of God to call out that elect the was forn from the foundational world it's that quick short work that is being done a lot of people are looking for it we are in it so one day it'll come now we it is already here we are part of the quick short work leot is the age of that quick work and we are witnessing first Thessalonians 4 we've seen him and is coming the son of man coming in word form to a prophet as he descended with a shout now the same anointing the same power the the same son of man as he descends and today as he descends he continues right on from the shout to the voice and and that is that is where God manifests himself in Bride form where the works of the bridegroom is now being done in his bride and this bride has to fulfill Enoch who prophesied the Lord is coming with 10,000 of his Saints we are here where and we are his Saints and the Lord is here and he's working his works the works of the bridegroom is now being worked to the bride 2,000 years ago he came in Groom form amen now he is here today on Earth in Bride form who is it it's the same son of man taking on our dust manifesting his life and manifesting his power oh there there are hundreds of scriptures and types that are that are in right now in the process of being a fulfillment it's the greatest hour of fulfillment that the world has ever seen Paul believed it was for his age but there there was a delay of 2,000 years of of Gentile Church ages of of seven Church ages but in the end he promised he would bring forth a bride who would be in his very image now that's not to say that would not was not a bride in other ages but we're saying the infant church has matured and is now at the time of marriage and this is the bride agent and she is the elect lady who is the Fulfillment and the embodiment of every Divine promise of God she is the fullness of the godhead or the word of God God in a body so all that was made known through men like Enoch different ones down to the ages Samson as I went to it last week one it's all not being made manifest in a bride body they were prophesying of you this bride is God's crowning achievement she's a spotless bride with ever stain of sin gone the unbelief of the ages erased the opening of The Seven Seals gave us a title deed book it searched every claim that was against the church and removed it and you are a spotless bride of Jesus Christ standing as though you never sinned in the first place with the unbelief of the ages removed from your life and the clutch that Rome has had of the great Harlot system on Samson the church has now been taken off because there's a people back in Covenant with God what an age we're living this is the marriage of the land a spotless bride dressed in the righteousness of the word of the hour after thousands of years of delay remember Paul was looking for that fulfillment in his age he wasn't even thinking of this age he didn't even know we were to be here and God would hide it from them in that day and brother bam he told Brother Bram told him said God hid it because if Satan could have got a hold of it he'd have done great damage so he hid it from them and he wrote in symbols and you got a whole book called the unveiling or the Apocalypto the unveiling of God and his end time plan and he writes it all in symbols in parabolic form and he stirs it up for the last day until an intelligence would come hallelujah amen that would reveal the mysteries of God to an end time people to give them the faith and position them in the promise I feel the Holy Ghost all over me let me just tell you where we're standing at after thousands of years of delay we are standing right in the Fulfillment of scripture and scripture that was once symbols and Mysteries and parabolic form now we know and that intelligence ought to give you a power to overcome in this age and to drive out the spirit of Darkness to make you know you are the Overcomer here in the Leo to C and age and you you will rise above everything the devil has brought against you Hallelujah Paul would say we which our alive and remain he thought he was he didn't know it was for another age another time much like when Isaiah prophesied I'll show you a sign you want a sign I'll show you one Behold a virgin shall conceive what I imagine if anybody ever want to cram words back in his mouth he did but he said she'll bring forth a son he'll be called Emanuel this is a sign but it'd be 700 and something years before the sign would be shown God spoke a word and it would lay dormant until the season and what I'm telling you we are in the season we are in the season because we're seeing the wings of the morning as the sun rises you see it would be the longsuffering of God that would give the Gentiles a chance and the bride is going to be there because she's chosen a god before the foundational world the heart purpose of God was to have a bride of his own choosing and I'll just tell you God will not give up on his plan amen the and the bride will not be a part of the Harlot system she will be a Chase virgin true to him in every way she she will not take on the seeds of man organized religion but she will be the Spotless bride of Christ and yet it's written in all the types of the Bible I mean how many do we have to go through Joseph is while exiled and rejected by his Brethren received a gentile bride and then sent her to the Palace where when the time came to reveal itself to his bre think of that while he's away while he's while he's been pushed away and away from his brother the rejected Christ Joseph got a gentile bride think about Moses the same you know here he is a strained from his Brethren rejected and you know here here they had a chance for the deliverer and then rather than getting behind the the the Deliverance what did they do they they made fun of it and and Moses run and while he's away he gets a gentile bride look again look at some of these Gentile Brides it was Rahab the type of the Gentile bride redeemed from among the Damned people of Jericho who was utterly destroyed and redeemed from that and elevated to a great lady in Israel mother of the Messiah elevated by marriage don't you know it's your union with Christ that is elevated you to where you are you an outcast of damn people lost but God redeemed you and brought you out under a token under a message in this day and hour and set you apart to call you his own Ruth type of the Gentile bride brought to the promised land following the the Jewish woman Naomi declaring you're people will be my people and my God your God my God isn't that so isn't that so aren't we that Ruth what do you think about Abraham your people is my people that's my father come on Church me what what about David that that's that's that's my that's my king there amen we identify with all of those in the Bible why because we are that Ruth your people are my people your God the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new hallelujah amen your people is our people amen your God is my God isn't that where we stand are you that Ruth this morning Hallelujah and Ruth wanted more than a handful of barley she wanted more than even fills of grain she wanted Boaz and if I know your heart this morning it's more than just having a nice church and having a little worship and having a nice song but what you really want is boas give me that [Applause] life she craved that seed and brought forth the king for out of her out of Boaz came Jesse out of Jesse came David to sit on the throne and then he was only reflecting the great king to come Jesus Christ all of these were prophesying but God buried it in the scripture he kept it a secret in types and shadows but to you he breaks the seals on the secret it's the work of the lover the bride bridegroom Whispering love secrets to his bride we're at the time where the scripture of his coming is in the process of fulfillment as the light comes on the wings of the morning it's not meant to be a scripture of the past and I've said it over and over and I say it again this morning it's no longer a scripture of the future that we need to refer to at some funeral where we try to give a word of comfort our comfort is it's happening h brother Tim well I I I I I just don't know I I just don't know about this I just don't know about this you know you're you're you're talking about how you know how he comes and how he descends with from heaven with the shout and that it's a mighty message and and it's all of this well you know maybe we need to look in the prophecy let's go down to Exodus 3 I don't have this in my scriptures this morning but Exodus 3 it's not in my notes bear with me a second let's go to verse one and we're going to read down through about verse seven or eight now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even the horb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out the midst of a bush so now here we have him one of the very first occurrences of the pillar of fire being visible and in the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see the great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God who was it thought it was just an angel God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I what's now the next verse and he said draw not nigh hither and put off thy shoes from off th feet for the place where on thou standest is Holy Ground I'll tell you an age of time when when the pillar of fire is seen is a holy grounds and you're standing on it and he said and he said moreover he said I am not I was oh I love this listen what his theme is of his message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever I am not I will be I was I am God is present T he is the I am God I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and can I say he's the god of Samson he's the god of Abraham he's the god of Ruth he's the God come on Church he's a god of the disciples he's the god of Mary Magdalene out of whom he cast Seven Devils and he did the same thing for you and this age and cast out the Devils the tormenters of the ages out of your life so you can be a people free you can be a people free the Creeds of man no longer hold you the Demons of Torment no longer bound you I am the god of Mary Magdalene I'm the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Jesus would said he is a God not of the dead but of the living and this proves they're still alive they're in another realm moving a little come on now moving a little faster than this one but they're in another realm but they're there and they're very much alive you don't believe it I mean there are books that are written by by medical doctors I can give you titles of them what you know that I I've read that that I have poured over and that I've looked because when my wife passed away I not only looked into the message into the Bible but I wonder she's gone where is she I hear a brother Bisal tell of a believer in South Africa who had an Affliction he's going get needed surgery he goes and gets the surgery comes back from the surgery to the recovery room somebody Kinks his O oxygen hose and the nurse does something chokes him off and he dies his machines are going on and there he could not talk he could not alert anybody and he's dying he's he's his heart has stopped beating and he he leaves his body and he is standing up there looking back down in another body looking back at his body on the gurnie and they come running in from everywhere and grab his gurnie and Rush him to the operating room and he follows him down the hall into the operating room exactly where it is he can describe every bit of it where they was how they were dressed who was there even the physician who came back in his everyday clothes as he was called on the emergency call running down the hall he can see every bit of it and he watches them as they work over his body in a moment he will enter back into his body and will wake up medical doctors and I believe it was a medical doctor who was reporting this in in one of the the accounts she said that she left her body there in the operating room and as she did she moved up out of it and was looking down at and working on her body and said as I was there I noticed on the top of the fan blade on top of a fan blade up there was a a little red sticker and he said I come back into my body I was telling the Physicians what I seen how that I did they wouldn't listen they get a intern he wouldn't listen to get a nurse and she's listening kind of sympathetically you know they're crazy they need to go to the psych ward and everything else and here she is she says look look if you don't believe me I've told you how you were dressed I told you to describe the instruments you used in the surgery I I showed you everything and said you still won't believe me but if one of you will get up on a step ladder and look down on that fan and look down on the top of that blade right up there you'll see the red sticker that I saw while I was there and she convinced him to climb up get a ladder and climb up and take a look and there it was right there as he as he saw it when you die you go somewhere you have another body amen and I want you just to realize here as we are thinking about it here we're living in the hour where those that are in that other dimension are about to come here that the scripture that we're talking about here as we're as as we're seeing the full fulfillment where we covered one another with these words I want to say we have received a mighty message let's go back right here to Exodus 3 and let's finish this cuz I want to I want to show you the parallel look at the prophecy in the scripture that was that Exodus let's look at this Exodus let's compare the two watch now where he says and the Lord said verse S well let let go back to six so I'm the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt listen if God saw it then God sees it now amen if God said I come down to see what's going on in Sodom because this wickedness is going on and he said in this day it would be as it was in the days of Sodom he's come down in this day come on church amen you you see he has to do it his prophecy shows him doing it what's now the intelligence and he says H H I have surely seen all the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their Tas Masters for I know their sorrows next verse and I am come down the Lord himself shall descend I am come down to deliver them let me tell you friends the presence of the Christ that is Among Us is for the purpose of Deliverance amen he you're going to take back everything the devil stole from you you're going to get back your health you're going to get your children back you're going to be blessed in every way that there can be because he said I am bringing you to a land of promise and it's full of milk and honey and every kind of Promise in the word belongs to you as a Believer and you can receive it it is yours don't give up on the promise he is right here to fulfill it it's coming on the wings of the morning blessed be the name of the Lord stand to your feet and worship God hallelujah blessed be his name amen may he come on the wings of the morning to you this morning you can see a light in the time of darkness and in this hour you can take hope and comfort yourself with these words I will not leave you comfortless my promise is yours Hallelujah and you are mine blessed be the name of the Lord he's coming soon he's com [Music] with joy we welcome
