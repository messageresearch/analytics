[37:46] us um you know I I don't know about you
[37:50] but maybe maybe some of you had a little
[37:51] hard time trying to get to the house of
[37:53] God
[37:54] tonight anybody
[37:57] you know the devil's always fighting
[37:58] he's always Waring against you and and
[38:01] you know we're we're trying to have some
[38:02] meetings uh this weekend back home and
[38:05] you know when things start to stir up
[38:07] and it seems like things are maybe
[38:09] getting pulled this way and that way and
[38:11] things are getting disrupted and it
[38:13] seems like man I can't even make it to
[38:15] the house of God you might as well just
[38:16] get
[38:17] excited might as well start saying you
[38:19] know what obviously God has something in
[38:21] store for me because the devil is really
[38:24] fighting against this so I'm just great
[38:26] expectation for what the Lord would have
[38:29] for us uh just reading here in
[38:31] Deuteronomy uh chapter uh
[38:34] 23 and verse five just a short scripture
[38:37] reading it says nevertheless the Lord
[38:39] thy God would not hearken unto
[38:42] balum but the Lord thy God turned the
[38:45] curse into a blessing unto
[38:47] thee because the Lord thy
[38:50] God loved thee amen we ask a blessing
[38:54] upon the reading of the word you may be
[38:56] seated
[38:57] I I just had this quote in my Bible I I
[39:00] didn't plan on reading it but it was so
[39:02] good I couldn't pass it up uh the
[39:04] prophet of God would say and why are
[39:06] people so tossed about he says the
[39:08] Christian faith is based solidly upon
[39:12] rest that's right a Christian is not
[39:15] tossed about a Christian doesn't run
[39:17] from place to place a Christian doesn't
[39:19] fuss and fume and worry about things a
[39:22] Christian rest it's all over it's all
[39:26] finished for the believer at Calvary
[39:28] that's right oh sickness may come and
[39:31] disappointments but the Christian is at
[39:33] rest knowing this that God is able to
[39:35] keep that which he has performed knowing
[39:37] that no matter what the thing and how it
[39:40] looks there is neither sickness sorrow
[39:42] death there is neither starvation or
[39:44] anything that can separate us from the
[39:46] love of God that's in Jesus Christ we're
[39:49] at rest Just Let The Old Ship toss any
[39:53] way she wants to The Anchor Holds aren't
[39:56] you thankful for the anchor you know
[39:58] something in the heart of a Believer no
[40:00] matter what comes your way uh there's an
[40:03] anchor and maybe just to pull this uh
[40:06] text into uh give you some perspective
[40:09] here just reading out of the per pergami
[40:11] and church uh age uh the prophet would
[40:13] say so Israel came up to the borders of
[40:16] Moab and sent Messengers to the king
[40:18] saying we are brothers let us pass
[40:21] through your land if our people or
[40:23] animals eat or drink anything we will
[40:26] glad pay for it but the king Balo got
[40:29] very excited that the head of the nickel
[40:32] and bunch was not about to let that
[40:34] church come through with its signs and
[40:36] wonders and diverse manifestations of
[40:38] the Holy Ghost with their faces shining
[40:40] with the glory of God it was too risky
[40:43] as he might lose some of his crowd so
[40:45] Bayo refused to let Israel pass through
[40:48] in fact so great was his fear of them
[40:51] that he went to a hireling prophet
[40:52] called balam and asked him to mediate
[40:54] between him and God and petition
[40:57] Almighty to curse Israel and render them
[41:00] impotent and balum being eager to take
[41:03] part in political Affairs and become a
[41:05] great man was only too glad to do so but
[41:08] seeing that he had to approach to and
[41:10] receive an audience from God to get the
[41:12] people cursed as he could not do it by
[41:14] himself he went to ask God if he could
[41:17] have his permission to go now isn't that
[41:20] just like the nickel adans we have with
[41:22] us today they curse everyone that won't
[41:25] go their way
[41:27] uh but I want you to take notice in our
[41:29] text it says God would not hearken unto
[41:33] balam but the Lord God turned the curse
[41:36] into a blessing unto thee uh by the help
[41:39] of God I'd like to just speak to you
[41:41] this evening on turning the curse into a
[41:45] blessing and I want to just look at the
[41:47] scripture right out here in the
[41:48] beginning why did he do it why why did
[41:52] he turn the curse into a
[41:54] blessing because he loved you
[41:56] and I think maybe that might be just a
[41:58] good way to start the service tonight is
[42:00] just to start to think about the love of
[42:04] God that God loves you he he he he he he
[42:08] has your best interest in mind you might
[42:11] not feel like he does but God is looking
[42:13] out unto you with compassion he wants to
[42:16] take care of you he he he wants to Bear
[42:18] you up he wants to minister to your
[42:20] needs God loves you you know and that
[42:23] first Urgent Cry came uh from the garden
[42:25] of that Adam and Eve had fallen you know
[42:28] they had broke the Commandment of God
[42:30] and now they they were coming under the
[42:32] Judgment of God and as he was driving
[42:34] there from the Garden of Eden uh the
[42:37] prophet of God would dramatize it there
[42:39] uh they were going out with them sheep
[42:41] skims just beating against their legs
[42:43] and that the dripping blood uh uh uh uh
[42:45] dripping down them but there was
[42:47] something uh funneling down l e that
[42:50] wasn't willing to see them go out in
[42:52] that condition and God said I'll put
[42:55] enmity
[42:57] between thy seed and the woman's seed
[42:59] promising of the Savior see he wasn't
[43:01] willing to leave his children in that
[43:03] condition he was going to make a way he
[43:05] didn't want to see them living under the
[43:06] curse he didn't want to see them living
[43:08] under the penalty of sin so he made a
[43:10] way that they could be delivered he made
[43:12] a way that they could be
[43:15] forgiven oh the love of
[43:17] God have you ever experienced
[43:21] it I mean it it's hard to even fathom
[43:24] it if it's just a church story to you
[43:27] and and maybe it's just something that's
[43:29] talked about at church I say why don't
[43:31] you start to ask God if if there's such
[43:33] a thing why don't you show your love to
[43:35] me cuz there's nothing like it oh oh
[43:37] when you're in need and you're in
[43:39] bondage and and you don't know where to
[43:41] go and you don't know what to think and
[43:42] you feel like you're going to have a
[43:43] mental breakdown and the love of God
[43:45] comes to you and he he wraps his arms
[43:48] around you and he tells you that you're
[43:49] my son and I love you all he'll be a
[43:52] fatherless to the fatherless he'll be a
[43:54] husband to the widow or he'll be it'll
[43:56] be whatever you have need of tonight if
[43:58] you'll just open up your heart and say
[44:00] Lord here I am Show Your Love unto me oh
[44:03] God I'm seeking your face I have a need
[44:06] [Applause]
[44:08] tonight Lord I want to bring your
[44:10] attention to Deuteronomy chapter 30 and
[44:12] verse 19 it says I call Heaven and Earth
[44:14] to record this day against you that I
[44:17] have set before you life and death
[44:19] blessing and cursing therefore choose
[44:22] life yes that both you and thy seed may
[44:27] live you have a choice that you can make
[44:31] tonight you you you can choose the
[44:33] condition and feel like there's no way
[44:35] out or you can look to a promise you can
[44:38] choose life and we know that the Old
[44:39] Testament was law was just a shadow of
[44:42] the New Testament obey the word and be
[44:45] blessed disobey the word and be cursed
[44:47] the prophet of God would say this and
[44:49] putting on the whole Army say many
[44:51] people just take taken the letter the
[44:53] letter kth but the spirit giveth life
[44:56] life see and they take their Creeds and
[44:58] so forth still kth but when you are
[45:01] taking the spirit that's God himself how
[45:05] do you know it's God because he taking
[45:07] the word and manifesting it see then
[45:10] it's God himself oh my spoken word yes
[45:13] sir look many people many churches say
[45:15] they believe the word many people say
[45:17] they believe the message many people
[45:19] Proclaim uh that they're Christians and
[45:21] that there's Believers but I want to ask
[45:23] you where's the life where is the spirit
[45:25] because the prophet is pointing out if
[45:27] you believe the word well the word is
[45:29] one thing if you believe the letter but
[45:31] the letter kth but there has to come
[45:34] something else there has to come the
[45:36] spirit to make that word live because if
[45:38] you're only laying claim to a letter if
[45:41] you're only laying claim to the books
[45:43] and and the tapes and just what's been
[45:45] written out there then it's going to
[45:47] kill but if you want to say oh God I
[45:49] need the spirit of Christ to come and
[45:52] Quicken the word that the quickening
[45:54] power can be found in me and make this
[45:57] word live look there's no other way to
[45:59] do it the flesh profiteth you nothing
[46:01] you're not going to be able to Manifest
[46:03] this message on your own it's going to
[46:05] have to come from something from
[46:07] somewhere a power come from somewhere to
[46:10] Quicken that word to you and to bring it
[46:13] into
[46:15] manifestation Jesus said it's the spirit
[46:17] that quickeneth the flesh profiteth
[46:19] nothing I don't know about you but has
[46:20] anybody found out that the flesh don't
[46:23] profiteth you
[46:24] anything
[46:26] right if you've lived on this Earth long
[46:29] enough it don't take long to find out
[46:31] that this old bag of bones can't profit
[46:33] anything you just mess everything
[46:36] up you can try to bring to pass the word
[46:39] of God you can try to live the message
[46:41] you can try not to cut your hair you can
[46:43] wear long dresses and all of that you
[46:46] you might look like the the greatest
[46:49] example of a message believer but in
[46:51] that state the letter
[46:54] kth yeah it takes more than your good
[46:59] effort it takes more than your works
[47:02] because the flesh profit you nothing the
[47:05] words that I speak unto you they are
[47:08] spirit and they are life I say if I have
[47:11] a choice t i I choose life I choose the
[47:14] spirit I I love the word I love the
[47:17] message but I want the life of the
[47:19] message I want the spirit of the message
[47:21] I want it to come into me I want to see
[47:23] it in manifestation I want to see it in
[47:26] power I don't want to just leave it on a
[47:28] book I don't want to just leave it on a
[47:30] tape I don't want to leave it in some
[47:31] prayer line back in the 60s I want to
[47:33] see the same God the same power the same
[47:37] manifestations in my body in my church
[47:40] in my family right here right now today
[47:43] not tomorrow not some other week we're
[47:45] not even guaranteed tomorrow we have
[47:49] tonight and I say why not tonight oh God
[47:52] pour your spirit out upon the Believers
[47:54] I want to see those word in full
[47:57] manifestation and in power in you and in
[48:00] you and in you why it's been
[48:03] [Applause]
[48:06] promised the question is what are you
[48:12] following you must choose your
[48:15] leader choose today you choose life or
[48:19] death your choice will determine your
[48:21] Eternal
[48:24] destination what you choose remember
[48:26] Jesus said follow
[48:27] me and you're invited to do so yes and
[48:32] to follow him to eternal life you must
[48:34] come on his terms that's right the word
[48:38] not upon the Creed not upon the public
[48:42] opinion we got a lot of public opinion
[48:45] nowadays not upon a so-called message
[48:48] opinion lot of opinions out
[48:51] there not upon what anybody else thinks
[48:54] about it but on what God said about
[48:59] it what God said about it see Satan's
[49:03] always wanting to cause doubt that's
[49:04] what he's been doing from the very
[49:06] beginning hath God not said
[49:10] right I I wonder why we are so quick to
[49:13] reason amongst ourselves with the word
[49:15] of God look if the prophet said it I
[49:16] believe
[49:18] it if it's laying in the I don't care
[49:20] where it's at if it's 47 to 65 I don't
[49:23] care if he said it I believe it
[49:26] if he said these signs shall follow them
[49:28] that believe I believe it if he said in
[49:31] my name you shall cast out evil spirits
[49:32] you say shall lay hands on the sick and
[49:34] they shall recover I believe
[49:36] it but the devil wants to sit there and
[49:39] be the skeptic and say well you prayed
[49:40] for so and so and they weren't
[49:44] healed I'm not
[49:47] looking at
[49:49] results as some type of vindication for
[49:52] what God
[49:54] Said
[49:57] cuz God meant what he
[49:58] said because I pray for somebody and
[50:01] they're not healed doesn't mean God's a
[50:03] [Applause]
[50:06] liar it only means I'm going to stand
[50:09] there and continue to believe because I
[50:12] have a
[50:14] promise ain't that what Abraham did when
[50:18] all the Skeptics and everybody said
[50:20] Abraham what are you doing he said I
[50:21] have a
[50:22] promise but we got to choose what we're
[50:24] following to choose what we're listening
[50:26] to we got to choose what we're giving
[50:28] our ear to Satan's over here just trying
[50:30] to get you to doubt cause you to believe
[50:32] God's word you go through trials and you
[50:34] go through heartaches and you go through
[50:36] pain and the Satan tries to come along
[50:38] and tell you that God's Not A A Healer
[50:40] God doesn't love you God God God doesn't
[50:42] care for you come on that's his tactic
[50:45] that's exactly what he did with the
[50:46] prophet when the prophet was going
[50:48] through the most trying hour of his
[50:49] whole life there his wife had been taken
[50:52] from him his baby had been taken from
[50:53] him and there he's he's pleading for his
[50:56] baby he's asking God cuz now his his
[50:58] sharing Rose is being taken from he's
[51:00] like Lord will you H he felt like a
[51:02] black curtain came down like God would
[51:03] him hear his
[51:05] prayer he come way too late to tell
[51:08] brother brandom that that God uh wasn't
[51:10] a Healer that God wasn't
[51:13] real he come way too late to tell me I
[51:16] I've seen the transforming power of God
[51:19] I know what I used to be
[51:22] glory come too late to tell me yes amen
[51:27] but he has a way of working on your
[51:29] mind you in your flesh you get weak you
[51:32] you feel like you've been bearing this
[51:34] burden so long and under the weight of
[51:35] the pressure then he kind of slips in
[51:37] and says you know what he really don't
[51:39] love
[51:42] you and it was in that moment brother
[51:44] brandham thought you know what he said
[51:46] you look he he you know your your
[51:48] brother's died and this family memb died
[51:50] and that member and all you've done if
[51:52] you've labored all this and he really
[51:53] doesn't love you and he's just like you
[51:54] know what if that's how it
[51:57] is and he was about to throw in the
[52:01] tow but there was something there that
[52:04] was keeping him there was something
[52:07] there that was holding him don't you
[52:10] realize that in your life it's not you
[52:12] keeping yourself but there is something
[52:14] there I want to say that's the only
[52:16] reason you're here tonight is there has
[52:19] been something keeping you something
[52:21] holding you something over your life
[52:23] that's been watching out over you that's
[52:25] been protecting you that's been bringing
[52:27] you to this place where you are
[52:30] now not something you can do it's
[52:32] something that God has already
[52:35] [Applause]
[52:37] done but we go through our tests we go
[52:39] through our
[52:41] trial the prophet would say and how can
[52:44] I overcome he says he that cometh to God
[52:47] must first be
[52:51] tested what with the
[52:54] word
[52:58] that's God's test do you believe it he
[53:02] that cometh to God must be
[53:05] tested that only shows a true child then
[53:08] see be tested and when the test
[53:12] comes you can't overcome listen now you
[53:16] can't overcome L there's a test give to
[53:21] you and when the test is
[53:23] given it's to see whether you can
[53:26] overcome or not and Jesus said to him
[53:29] that overcometh the test the test is the
[53:32] greatest thing that ever happened to
[53:36] you well you might not feel like what
[53:39] are you talking about it's the greatest
[53:40] thing that ever happened to
[53:42] me sure doesn't feel like it it sure
[53:46] doesn't look like it you feel like
[53:49] you've been Waring and battling this for
[53:51] so long for so many years you feel like
[53:54] you can't go in any further you can't go
[53:56] on and you're trying to tell me this is
[53:58] the best thing that ever happened to me
[54:00] you got a choice to make
[54:03] tonight you can take God at his word and
[54:06] say Lord if you say that's the greatest
[54:09] thing that ever happened to me then I'm
[54:11] going to praise
[54:13] you oh watch out the devil hates that
[54:18] now the test is the greatest thing that
[54:21] ever happened to you I believe it's
[54:23] written in the scripture Peter said that
[54:24] our Tri are worth more to us than
[54:26] precious
[54:27] gold it's a testing time it's one good
[54:32] evidence to us that God is with us when
[54:35] we're tested for all children of God are
[54:39] tested and
[54:44] tried all God's
[54:47] children are tested and
[54:50] tried and the
[54:52] trial is the greatest thing that ever
[54:54] happened happen to
[54:56] you you know when when the Hebrew
[54:59] children were about to be thrown into
[55:00] the fiery
[55:02] furnace I I don't necessarily think they
[55:05] were walking along saying you know what
[55:07] guys I think this is the greatest thing
[55:08] that ever happened to us I mean tell you
[55:11] what we we couldn't have asked for any
[55:13] can you believe this we are being
[55:15] escorted by the guards to a fiery
[55:17] furnace under the King's Command I tell
[55:19] you what this is all my hopes and all my
[55:22] dreams I was just hoping this would
[55:23] happen awesome
[55:26] I mean I tell you what I I just was
[55:27] wondering Lord what could be the
[55:29] greatest thing that ever happened in my
[55:31] life and I was like
[55:32] ha no it didn't feel that way it didn't
[55:36] look that way but what were they doing
[55:39] they had a promise they had a word and
[55:41] they said you know what I'm not going to
[55:42] go I'm not going to bow down to the God
[55:44] of this evil
[55:46] age oh King live forever look I if if
[55:49] God delivers us he'll Deliver us if he
[55:51] don't he don't but whatever you do I'm
[55:53] not bowing down to to your image I'm not
[55:56] bowing down to Satan's inen I'm not
[55:58] going to give up and say God's Not A
[55:59] Healer I'm not going to come down under
[56:01] the test and say you know what well God
[56:03] didn't mean what he said no God meant
[56:05] what he said and it's in the test in the
[56:07] trial when it's the greatest thing that
[56:09] ever happened to
[56:12] you I I don't know how the whole scene
[56:15] unfolded but I could just imagine them
[56:17] uh uh walking them down there could have
[56:18] been people rallying around wagering
[56:20] bets how do you how close do you think
[56:21] they'll get to the furnace man I don't
[56:23] know the last guys didn't get with 50 ft
[56:26] of it and it was only heated twice it's
[56:28] seven times how much you got on it they
[56:30] don't make 100t close to that
[56:32] thing now all of a sudden the guards are
[56:35] dropping and they're still
[56:39] walking what is going on here they got
[56:42] closer to the other guys you see it was
[56:45] in the
[56:46] trial it was in the test didn't look
[56:50] like it was the greatest thing that ever
[56:53] happened
[56:55] but it was in the fire there was a
[56:57] fourth
[57:00] man sounds like a pretty great
[57:03] thing when the king looked down there I
[57:05] thought we threw only three in
[57:10] there I like that story about the
[57:12] footprints on the Sands of
[57:16] TI said Lord I looked back through my
[57:19] life and I
[57:21] wondered there there we were walking
[57:23] together but when I got to my lowest
[57:26] hours when I got to my darkest night I
[57:29] only see one foot of set of one set of
[57:32] footprints why did you leave me in my
[57:34] darkest hour yeah when I felt all alone
[57:37] I felt I couldn't take another step I I
[57:39] I felt I couldn't cry another tear I
[57:42] thought I was going to lose my mind I
[57:44] was ready to give up I was ready to
[57:45] throw in the towel I couldn't take it
[57:47] any
[57:49] longer why did you leave me oh son oh
[57:53] daughter amen
[57:56] that's not I didn't leave
[57:58] you that's when I was carrying
[58:02] you those Footprints you see are me
[58:04] bearing you up and holding you I've been
[58:07] carrying you I've been bringing you
[58:09] through it's in those greatest trials
[58:11] and those greatest hours that God
[58:13] manifest himself to the
[58:16] believer that God is proving his word in
[58:19] your
[58:22] life see if it was in your own efforts
[58:25] if it was in your own ability you would
[58:27] have given up a long time ago You' have
[58:29] thrown in the towel a long time ago
[58:31] you'd have say it's just my time to go I
[58:32] don't think I can go on any longer but
[58:34] something has been keeping you something
[58:36] has been carrying
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:40] you right it was in that fire
[58:45] that Jesus Christ came on the scene amen
[58:49] yeah I think of the children of Israel
[58:51] you would have thought that a after all
[58:52] the Miracles and all the things that
[58:54] they had seen here God brought them out
[58:56] by a mighty
[58:57] hand right and now now they they they've
[59:00] come out of Egypt they're at the Red Sea
[59:02] and and once again they're murmuring and
[59:04] complaining oh Moses did you bring us
[59:05] out here to die you know watch The
[59:07] Mighty hand of the Lord he and now he he
[59:10] Parts the Red Sea and they they go
[59:12] through on dry land destroys all their
[59:15] enemy now they get out in the wilderness
[59:17] and once again they're thirsty they're
[59:19] they're starting to murmur they're
[59:20] starting to complain they have needes
[59:21] like Moses did you bring us out here to
[59:23] die
[59:25] right is that what we do as mature
[59:27] Christians when when when when it starts
[59:29] to get really hard and and it seems like
[59:32] we're not going to be able to pay the
[59:33] bills and and just doesn't seem like
[59:35] everything's going right we start to
[59:37] wonder where did I mess up where did
[59:38] everything go
[59:42] wrong I I I think that if I was out
[59:45] there in the wilderness and I'd seen God
[59:48] Time After Time After Time deliver me
[59:51] Time After Time After Time God meet my
[59:53] need
[59:56] I would have said you know what if we're
[59:59] thirsty I'm going to start looking for
[1:00:01] rain if I'm hungry I'm going to start
[1:00:02] looking for Mana if you have a need I
[1:00:04] say why don't you just start looking for
[1:00:06] the
[1:00:06] blessing why don't you start looking for
[1:00:08] your deliverance why don't you start
[1:00:10] looking for the manifestation of the
[1:00:12] promise I wonder if you're really in
[1:00:14] expectation for the manifestation of the
[1:00:17] word that God has
[1:00:18] spoken you know the most powerful word
[1:00:21] has been spoken over the bride of Christ
[1:00:23] that in the hour that you're living in
[1:00:25] in the most wicked age that you are
[1:00:27] going to be changed in a moment and a
[1:00:29] twinkling of an
[1:00:30] eye that your womb is already been
[1:00:33] sealed by the word of God that you can't
[1:00:35] even be impregnated by the things of
[1:00:37] this
[1:00:38] world we sound like we're
[1:00:42] lunatics but you are the very one that
[1:00:45] is going to manifest the fullness of
[1:00:47] this
[1:00:48] word hey I believe
[1:00:53] it
[1:00:56] amen the doctor doesn't have the final
[1:00:58] say you know the doctor told me I had
[1:01:02] cancer okay but God said I'm Healed
[1:01:05] that's right I have a choice sure we
[1:01:08] recognize we battle we recognize we
[1:01:10] might have sickness but that is not our
[1:01:12] the the doctor doesn't have the final
[1:01:14] say that's right
[1:01:17] amen we're not interested in public
[1:01:19] opinions we're not interested in man
[1:01:21] ideas sure doctors do what they can do
[1:01:23] they do all they can do but the doctor
[1:01:25] doesn't have the final say when the
[1:01:26] doctors go so far that's where God steps
[1:01:30] in that's what we
[1:01:35] believe and that's where we stand faith
[1:01:37] is not based on anything else but the
[1:01:39] word of God faith is not based on past
[1:01:42] failures faith is not based for what you
[1:01:44] produced in the flesh faith is based on
[1:01:47] the
[1:01:48] word and faith comes by hearing the word
[1:01:50] it's about time we start believing in
[1:01:52] who we really are amen that's right amen
[1:01:57] we have a choice and it's just not on
[1:01:58] Wednesday night and it's just not on
[1:02:00] Sunday
[1:02:01] morning we have a choice every single
[1:02:04] day of our life that this word would
[1:02:06] come into manifestation in our lives
[1:02:08] could you imagine if we had the same
[1:02:10] expectation my you know sometimes we
[1:02:12] come into a meeting we get all pumped up
[1:02:14] and we get all washed and cleaned out
[1:02:16] and we feel so good and and so revived
[1:02:19] and so refreshed and we're on fire for
[1:02:21] God and we're going back and we're
[1:02:23] actually talking amongst the Young
[1:02:24] people say oh my wouldn't got so good
[1:02:26] and then it's just maybe a little time
[1:02:28] one week two weeks three weeks and all
[1:02:30] of a sudden we're back right to the
[1:02:31] regular routine and we're starting to uh
[1:02:34] uh entertain the same things that we
[1:02:35] come out of and all of a sudden we come
[1:02:38] back from the mountain top and we're
[1:02:39] back in the
[1:02:41] valley that's the time to go
[1:02:45] fighting but we get on cruise control
[1:02:48] man I feel good I'm all washed up
[1:02:50] now I guess I can go relax no
[1:02:54] we want to go into Monday into battle
[1:02:56] Tuesday into
[1:02:58] battle seeking that which is lost
[1:03:00] praying for those that are sick say Lord
[1:03:03] uh speak to me Lead Me Guide Me Lord I
[1:03:05] want to see your word and action in my
[1:03:07] life in my family in my school in my
[1:03:10] relationships in my marriage on my job
[1:03:12] Lord oh God let me be that surrendered
[1:03:15] vessel that your life that the
[1:03:16] quickening power can come down into Lord
[1:03:19] that your Dynamics can come into the
[1:03:21] mechanics oh I believe the message I
[1:03:23] believe the words that's the mechanics
[1:03:25] but oh God I need the Dynamics of the
[1:03:27] message I need the quickening power of
[1:03:30] almighty God to drop down and Quicken
[1:03:32] the seed Quicken the word that I can be
[1:03:34] your hands
[1:03:35] [Music]
[1:03:38] extended not just some Fairy
[1:03:42] Tail not just between these four
[1:03:45] walls but each one of you come on that's
[1:03:50] right Christ the word manifested in your
[1:03:53] body amen yes right amen oh but you feel
[1:03:57] like you got so much going
[1:04:00] on you know Abraham
[1:04:02] certainly would have had a lot to point
[1:04:06] to saying look I'm old I have no ability
[1:04:11] but you gave me a promise but I love the
[1:04:13] Scripture it says Abraham staggered not
[1:04:15] at the promise of
[1:04:17] God through unbelief but was strong in
[1:04:21] faith giving glory to God there's a key
[1:04:25] there strong in
[1:04:27] faith giving glory to
[1:04:32] God sounds like Abraham had a little
[1:04:34] stimulation of
[1:04:36] Revelation strong in
[1:04:38] faith giv glory to
[1:04:41] God now think about it now he's received
[1:04:44] a promise he has no ability to bring it
[1:04:46] to
[1:04:49] pass and here he's going
[1:04:53] around acting like he's going to have a
[1:04:56] baby talking like he's going to have a
[1:05:00] baby now think about
[1:05:03] it here's grandma and grandpa walking
[1:05:05] around bless God glory to God we're
[1:05:07] going to have a
[1:05:09] baby go ahead and get the baby clothes
[1:05:11] go ahead and get the carriage go ahead
[1:05:13] and get everything lined up we're going
[1:05:15] to have a
[1:05:17] baby imagine the critics imagine the
[1:05:19] scoffers Imagine everybody looking
[1:05:21] imagine the doctors looking at Abraham
[1:05:22] say Abraham what's the matter with you
[1:05:25] you you you're well stricken in age oh
[1:05:28] but Abraham had something Abraham had a
[1:05:31] revelation because faith is a revelation
[1:05:34] that's right Abraham knew he was going
[1:05:36] to have that child why because God said
[1:05:38] he was going to have that child so he
[1:05:40] started acting like he was going to have
[1:05:42] a baby he started talking like he was
[1:05:44] going to have a baby well I wonder if
[1:05:46] we've really caught a revelation that
[1:05:47] we're going in a Rapture that we're
[1:05:49] really going to go in a body change that
[1:05:51] these signs shall follow them that
[1:05:53] believe I I wonder if we get a little
[1:05:55] stimulation of revelation we might just
[1:05:57] start talking like it we might just
[1:05:59] start acting like it we might just start
[1:06:01] proclaiming it we might just start
[1:06:03] speaking it and yes the whole world's
[1:06:05] going to look like you and say you sound
[1:06:07] really
[1:06:09] funny you sound really funny talking
[1:06:12] about that yeah maybe I do may maybe I
[1:06:14] sound really funny the scripture says if
[1:06:16] you say to this
[1:06:19] mountain speak the word if you say to
[1:06:21] this mountain then I'm going to start
[1:06:22] speaking the mountains I might sound
[1:06:25] really funny you know I tell you what
[1:06:26] they really sounded funny on the day of
[1:06:29] Pentecost they sounded so funny that
[1:06:32] when they busted out them doors into the
[1:06:34] streets all the town looked at them said
[1:06:36] you know these guys are drunk men they
[1:06:39] sound they're talking funny they're
[1:06:41] sounding funny they're acting
[1:06:44] funny but Peter had to say no no we are
[1:06:48] not drunk as you
[1:06:49] suppose this is that which was promised
[1:06:53] by the prophet of Joy I'll pour out my
[1:06:54] spirit upon All
[1:06:56] Flesh right brother I want to be like
[1:07:00] Abraham Lord I stagger not at the
[1:07:03] promises through
[1:07:05] unbelief but Lord I'm going to give you
[1:07:07] glory amen I'm going to give you praise
[1:07:11] in the midst of the trial in the midst
[1:07:13] of the storm when everything seems like
[1:07:15] it's going
[1:07:17] wrong Lord I'm going to give you praise
[1:07:20] you might sound funny Lord thank you you
[1:07:24] said in your word that the
[1:07:26] trial the test is the greatest thing
[1:07:28] that ever happened to
[1:07:31] me you let that sink into your heart you
[1:07:33] start talking like it you start acting
[1:07:36] like it Lord I know you'll see me
[1:07:38] through Lord your grace is sufficient
[1:07:40] Lord by your stripes I'm Healed Lord
[1:07:42] you've given me the promise so Lord I'm
[1:07:44] going to give you praise I it's a really
[1:07:46] a bad day today I'm really struggling
[1:07:48] Lord but you're my savior You're My
[1:07:50] Redeemer Lord I give you all the praise
[1:07:52] thank you for your great love where in
[1:07:54] if you love me Lord uh you're so
[1:07:56] gracious you're so merciful thank you
[1:07:57] for salvation Lord thank you for this
[1:07:59] message so I'm going to give you praise
[1:08:01] Lord I'm going to give you glory I'm
[1:08:03] going to give you adoration because
[1:08:04] there you have something that this world
[1:08:07] could never have it's faith in a promise
[1:08:09] and no matter what comes your way the
[1:08:11] devil can never rob you from
[1:08:15] that it's anchored oh yes and even when
[1:08:19] you want to give up even when you want
[1:08:21] to go you know what I something es
[1:08:25] something's holding you something's
[1:08:27] keeping
[1:08:30] you he that believeth on me the works
[1:08:33] that I do shall he do also and Greater
[1:08:36] Works than these shall he do because I
[1:08:37] go un my
[1:08:39] father we've heard these
[1:08:41] things where the Prophet would say so
[1:08:43] when a spirit bore a Spirit-filled man
[1:08:45] in faith takes the word into his heart
[1:08:47] and places it upon his lips why that's
[1:08:49] the same as deity speaking Every
[1:08:51] Mountain must
[1:08:52] go Satan cannot stand before that
[1:08:56] man do we shrink back from
[1:09:01] that we have to take these words into
[1:09:04] our heart and we must
[1:09:08] declare we must
[1:09:12] declare yeah we're going through some
[1:09:14] hard
[1:09:15] times we're going through some hard
[1:09:17] trials we have some loved ones and we
[1:09:19] have some family and certain ones that
[1:09:21] are suffering and we're praying and
[1:09:22] we're believing
[1:09:25] this ain't the hour to back up
[1:09:27] church this ain't the hour to shrink
[1:09:30] back this ain't the hour to wonder and
[1:09:31] doubt this is the hour to Proclaim more
[1:09:34] than ever before my God Is A Healer my
[1:09:37] God is a deliverer my God is a savior my
[1:09:40] God will do what he said he would do my
[1:09:42] God will perform the promise that he has
[1:09:45] given to me Faith declares it I won't
[1:09:48] stagger I won't back up I won't sit down
[1:09:51] I'll keep preaching it I'll keep
[1:09:53] proclaiming came in it over and over
[1:09:55] again why because I have received a
[1:09:58] [Applause]
[1:10:04] promise we're
[1:10:09] blessed Prophet
[1:10:12] said when Israel was on its
[1:10:15] March and come to the land of
[1:10:19] Moab there was a gate and they said we
[1:10:21] will not let you pass through
[1:10:24] and they brought out their Prophet to
[1:10:26] curse the
[1:10:28] people instead of cursing he
[1:10:30] blessed they tried to show him all the
[1:10:33] bad things that this people had
[1:10:35] done but God showed him the good things
[1:10:38] about
[1:10:40] it oh let that settle into your
[1:10:42] heart for he seen that smitten Rock and
[1:10:46] that brass serpent going before him
[1:10:48] making an atonement for them instead of
[1:10:51] cursing he blessed the seed and they put
[1:10:53] possessed the land because they were on
[1:10:55] their Road keeping a promise of Jehovah
[1:11:00] nothing could stop them for they were
[1:11:02] Abraham's seed with a promise that they
[1:11:05] possess the Gate of the enemy and they
[1:11:08] took it all I'm letting that promise of
[1:11:11] God settle in My Heart Lord nothing can
[1:11:13] stop me nothing can stop your word
[1:11:15] because it's not me it's you and me
[1:11:17] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:11:20] that is in the world and you are on your
[1:11:22] way home marching to Zion with a promise
[1:11:25] and Satan's trying to come into your way
[1:11:28] and trying to cast a stumbling block and
[1:11:30] say you're cursed and you're sick and
[1:11:32] you'll never make it I'm going to point
[1:11:33] to your failures I'm going to point to
[1:11:35] your past and Devil's constantly trying
[1:11:38] to make you look this way and look that
[1:11:40] way and Look Any Which Way But accept at
[1:11:42] the promise but if you'll just keep a
[1:11:43] single eye on his word and say Lord you

[1:11:48] family you gave me my son you gave me my
[1:11:51] daughters you gave me the Holy Ghost you

[1:18:49] talking to
[1:18:51] him
[1:18:53] it's not enough just to acknowledge
[1:18:56] it what about your need what about your

[1:19:02] oh oh that's what all the noise is about

[1:19:08] who come on who's passing
[1:19:12] by oh son of David oh yes sir if you're
[1:19:15] really here
[1:19:16] Lord would you pass by my
[1:19:19] way I'm going through a hard
[1:19:21] time
[1:19:24] I'm going through a
[1:19:25] time you know Satan's very crafty you
[1:19:29] know Paul said my speech and my
[1:19:30] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:19:32] man
[1:19:33] wisdom but it was in demonstration oh
[1:19:36] yes of spirit and
[1:19:41] power Prophet said if if Satan can't
[1:19:43] curse you curse you he'll try to
[1:19:45] organize
[1:19:47] you and he said so balum got Israel to
[1:19:51] commit fornication
[1:19:53] he said did you know that physical
[1:19:56] fornication is the very same spirit that
[1:19:58] lies in organized
[1:20:01] religion now let God deal with your
[1:20:03] heart because this doesn't have to be
[1:20:06] some way off out there we're talking
[1:20:09] about natural typing spiritual because
[1:20:11] this bride will manifest everything
[1:20:13] that's been spoken of
[1:20:15] her it's not a challenge it's a
[1:20:19] prophecy prophecies don't
[1:20:21] waver prophecies aren't a what
[1:20:26] if prophecies are
[1:20:29] sure but sometimes these promises that
[1:20:31] lay in the word we feel like they're at
[1:20:34] arms length because sometimes we have a
[1:20:36] choice to make sometimes there's steps
[1:20:39] we have to
[1:20:40] make because he says if he can't curse
[1:20:44] you he's going to organize
[1:20:49] you think about that sometimes we get
[1:20:52] into to our
[1:20:53] routine sometimes we get comfortable in
[1:20:56] within the framework of our
[1:20:58] church sometimes we get comfortable in
[1:21:01] our our life to where we just kind of
[1:21:04] are getting
[1:21:06] by but you are not called to tolerate
[1:21:09] sin that's
[1:21:12] right you know it makes me think of
[1:21:15] story i i i i comes to
[1:21:18] me anybody ever had a a fire alarm in
[1:21:22] your house a little smoke
[1:21:24] detector start to
[1:21:28] beep that is
[1:21:32] irritating but you know it's really
[1:21:33] something's funny about
[1:21:35] it if you just kind of allow it and you
[1:21:38] put up with it for a little
[1:21:41] bit and you put up with some
[1:21:44] more you you start to not really notice
[1:21:46] it anymore that's right you start to
[1:21:49] tolerate it you know they say confession
[1:21:51] is good for the soul so I'm going to
[1:21:54] confess you know I'm going to make an
[1:21:57] excuse for myself and you forgive me cuz
[1:21:58] I'm
[1:22:00] wrong but I in the work that I I've done
[1:22:03] once again I'm I'm just making an excuse
[1:22:05] so don't don't buy it in the work that I
[1:22:08] do I get in and out of my car all the
[1:22:10] time and uh brother Tim if you can
[1:22:13] imagine it's hard for me to remember to
[1:22:15] buckle my seat
[1:22:17] belt well you know there's a warning in
[1:22:21] your car that goes ding ding ding
[1:22:24] ding well I've tolerated that thing so
[1:22:29] long I've been on the phone talking to
[1:22:32] somebody and the person on the other end
[1:22:34] of the phone say will you please put
[1:22:36] your seat Bel
[1:22:38] on and I'm like I can't even hear
[1:22:43] it you know we do that with
[1:22:46] sin with little besetting sins and
[1:22:49] little things that we entertain we just
[1:22:50] kind of tolerate it well that's just
[1:22:53] kind of the way it is and you just
[1:22:54] tolerate it and all of a sudden we allow
[1:22:56] things into our life into our
[1:22:57] relationships into our marriage into our
[1:22:59] works space and we wonder why we get to
[1:23:02] where we are it's because the little
[1:23:03] things that we're tolerating but you're
[1:23:05] not called to tolerate sin you're called
[1:23:08] to put sin under your
[1:23:12] feet remember brother random said it's
[1:23:14] it's unconfessed sin of you
[1:23:17] Believers that will cause the church to
[1:23:19] bitterly
[1:23:21] fail not not unconfessed sin of you
[1:23:25] Sinners oh that's a
[1:23:28] key not unconfessed sin of you make
[1:23:31] Believers no the unconfessed sin of you
[1:23:33] Believers will cause this church to
[1:23:35] bitterly
[1:23:36] fail and I want to just encourage you
[1:23:39] I'm not trying to discourage you but I
[1:23:41] I'm trying to encourage you in the Lord
[1:23:42] that that we can't just go in sin in our
[1:23:45] private lives and think that it does not
[1:23:47] affect the
[1:23:49] body that is exactly what aen thought
[1:23:52] yeah he thought you know I'm just on my
[1:23:55] own I'm going to partake of this for
[1:23:57] myself and it caused the whole church to
[1:23:59] bitterly fail so we have a
[1:24:03] responsibility we have something that we
[1:24:05] have to do because you the prophet of
[1:24:08] God said and is your life worthy of the
[1:24:10] Gospel he said we've got to follow every
[1:24:13] day every hour of the day every step of
[1:24:16] the way we've got to be led by the Lord
[1:24:18] Jesus
[1:24:20] Christ if we don't we take it an
[1:24:22] organizational life think of
[1:24:24] this this smoked
[1:24:27] me when I read
[1:24:31] this and a life that doesn't follow
[1:24:33] Christ daily isn't worthy I said God
[1:24:35] forgive me for taking on an
[1:24:36] organizational life are y'all hearing
[1:24:38] with the prophet saying we've got to
[1:24:40] follow every day every hour of the day
[1:24:43] every step of the way we've got to be
[1:24:46] led by the Lord Jesus Christ if we don't
[1:24:48] we take an organizational life and a
[1:24:50] life that doesn't follow Christ daily is
[1:24:52] not worthy you are called to be more
[1:24:55] than just a
[1:24:57] churchgoer you're called to have
[1:24:59] dominion are right when Jesus came into
[1:25:03] the water he said to joh John he said
[1:25:06] suffer it to be so John John's like me
[1:25:09] me baptize you yes John suffer it to be
[1:25:12] be so because it becometh us to fulfill
[1:25:14] all righteousness there's been a
[1:25:16] prophetic word that has been
[1:25:19] spoken and we must fulfill that which
[1:25:23] has been
[1:25:24] spoken John it becometh us to fulfill
[1:25:26] all righteous don't you know bride that
[1:25:28] it becometh us to fulfill all righteous
[1:25:31] everything that has been spoken to you
[1:25:33] it becometh us to fulfill all the words
[1:25:36] that have been spoken of the Bride in
[1:25:37] the last day she is him yes you it
[1:25:40] becometh us to fulfill all the words
[1:25:42] that have been spoken
[1:25:45] amen look Malachi 4:5 has come to
[1:25:48] restore us
[1:25:51] back
[1:25:53] and I say back all the way to the
[1:25:55] beginning but even restore back the
[1:25:57] faith of the original Pentecostal
[1:26:01] fathers where there at the gate
[1:26:03] beautiful they were walking by Silver
[1:26:05] and Gold Have I None but such as which I
[1:26:07] have I give to
[1:26:09] you you got to have something to be able
[1:26:11] to
[1:26:14] give we need the quickening power yes
[1:26:17] sir the words that I speak unto you they
[1:26:19] are spirit and they are life Lord I
[1:26:22] thank you for the word I thank you for
[1:26:23] the mechanics but Lord God I need the
[1:26:25] Dynamics to come and make that word live
[1:26:29] Malachi 4 has come to restore us back to
[1:26:31] the beginning if you say to this
[1:26:34] mountain if you say little Gods
[1:26:39] Messiahs we're being restored all the
[1:26:41] way back to the beginning where you have
[1:26:43] dominion where you can speak the word
[1:26:45] the prophet of God said now the world is
[1:26:48] groaning and nature is groan crying
[1:26:50] everything's moving what for the
[1:26:51] manifestation of the sons of God when
[1:26:54] true Sons I'm reading real familiar
[1:26:56] quotes because I I I'm I'm reading them
[1:26:59] slowly because I really want these to
[1:27:00] settle into your heart for the
[1:27:02] manifestation of sons of God when true
[1:27:04] Sons born Sons filled Sons speak their
[1:27:06] word in it is
[1:27:09] back I'm in expectation and
[1:27:12] believing I'm not looking for something
[1:27:15] to come for
[1:27:16] this we've received everything that we
[1:27:19] have need of to produce the full of the
[1:27:22] word right
[1:27:24] now right
[1:27:26] now if we can all come into one mind and
[1:27:30] one Accord if we can all plead the blood
[1:27:32] of Jesus Christ if we can all uh confess
[1:27:35] of our sins if we can all start
[1:27:37] believing together and say you know what
[1:27:39] brother Matthew you're right I I've been
[1:27:41] I've kind of been living on the line
[1:27:43] I've been living on the and you said
[1:27:45] that our unconfessed sins can cause the
[1:27:47] church to bitterly fail you know there
[1:27:48] ought to be something in your heart that
[1:27:50] wants to repent say Lord I forgive
[1:27:52] forgive me for hindering the move of the
[1:27:54] Holy
[1:27:56] Spirit Come
[1:28:00] on did he did the prophet mean what he
[1:28:04] said then I say it's time
[1:28:07] Church let's get everything under the
[1:28:10] blood let's get our lives right let's
[1:28:13] get our marriages right let's get our
[1:28:14] families right let let's apply the
[1:28:16] token let's stop going through
[1:28:19] cycles of just repeating besetting over
[1:28:22] and over and I'm moving towards
[1:28:24] something by God's grace we'll pull this
[1:28:26] all
[1:28:27] together prophetess God said he's able
[1:28:30] to achieve to himself a bride he's going
[1:28:33] to do it in the last days be able to get
[1:28:35] a bride that with the ministry exactly
[1:28:38] like his like a man and his wife become
[1:28:40] one and when Jehovah gets his people
[1:28:43] like him then he lives in his people
[1:28:45] they are
[1:28:46] one it fulfills the scripture exactly
[1:28:49] like he said in St John 14 he that
[1:28:51] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:28:53] shall he do
[1:28:54] also now don't worry by God's grace
[1:28:56] we'll pull this all together you might
[1:28:57] wonder where how all of our thoughts
[1:29:00] going to come in here but we're called
[1:29:01] to be
[1:29:03] Overcomers sure we're going to have test
[1:29:06] we're going to have trials we're going
[1:29:09] to battle sickness the prophet said the
[1:29:11] Rapture and this is in the Rapture
[1:29:12] message he said the Rapture which is
[1:29:14] coming to pass and anything that God has
[1:29:17] in the line of his word there's always
[1:29:19] something to come out to upset that if
[1:29:21] they can it's Satan's purpose to do
[1:29:25] that it's Satan's purpose to try to
[1:29:28] break up the church it's Satan's purpose
[1:29:30] to try to cause division in the family
[1:29:32] it's Satan's purpose to try to cause
[1:29:34] conflict that's that's what his whole
[1:29:35] goal is is I is to disrupt the very plan
[1:29:39] of God and to get you to start to doubt
[1:29:41] who you are and to wonder why all of
[1:29:42] these things are happening in your
[1:29:46] life and then we come many of us come
[1:29:48] back to the place and say you know
[1:29:49] brother Matthew but I've
[1:29:50] tried I I i' I I believe all these
[1:29:54] things I believe what the prophet said
[1:29:56] but but I don't see any of the
[1:29:57] manifestation in my life I just can't
[1:30:00] ever get the victory why why do I always
[1:30:03] revert right back to the same things
[1:30:05] over and over brother and it seems like
[1:30:07] I can never get total
[1:30:09] Victory well let's just remind you that
[1:30:14] it's because of sinful flesh that you
[1:30:15] were born in a fallen
[1:30:18] nature we'll just deal with something
[1:30:20] really simple here
[1:30:23] you have a fallen
[1:30:25] nature you come into this world in a
[1:30:27] fallen nature living under a curse you
[1:30:30] know
[1:30:32] that we've been living under the curse
[1:30:34] because of sin the scripture would say
[1:30:37] because of one man's Disobedience We Are
[1:30:40] All Made Sinners Romans 3:23 would say
[1:30:42] for all have sinned and come short of
[1:30:44] the glory of God
[1:30:47] am when you come into this world you're
[1:30:49] born in sin you didn't even come with a
[1:30:52] Fighting Chance well I feel better
[1:30:56] already yeah maybe the reason why you
[1:30:57] feel like you've been getting whooped is
[1:30:59] cu you didn't have a Fighting Chance in
[1:31:00] the first place you were born in sin
[1:31:03] shaped in iniquity come into the world
[1:31:05] speaking lies within your own Spirit the
[1:31:07] desire of sin a lover of sin because you
[1:31:09] were born in sin you didn't have a
[1:31:13] chance
[1:31:16] but down inside of you
[1:31:20] somewhere here you come oh hallelujah
[1:31:25] amen there was something in there that
[1:31:28] begin to
[1:31:30] draw my Bible tells
[1:31:32] me no man can come unto the
[1:31:37] father
[1:31:38] unless he draws him that's
[1:31:42] right okay I want you to focus on one
[1:31:45] thing may maybe you've been going
[1:31:46] through a a
[1:31:48] cycle maybe you feel like you've been
[1:31:50] getting beat up
[1:31:52] but something inside of you believes the
[1:31:54] word something inside say brother
[1:31:56] Matthew I've tried over and over and
[1:31:58] over I keep falling I keep failing I I
[1:32:00] keep giving into the Same Spirit of lust
[1:32:02] I keep giving into these same things I
[1:32:04] feel like I can never get the victory
[1:32:05] but I want to ask you one question is
[1:32:07] there something in there that wants to
[1:32:10] be delivered is there something in there
[1:32:12] that want to manifest the word is there
[1:32:14] something in there what is that it's God
[1:32:16] drawing you don't you see that's the
[1:32:19] very blessing of God upon your life that
[1:32:22] he's drawing
[1:32:25] you yes you were born in a sin nature
[1:32:29] but regardless of your natural birth God
[1:32:31] has placed an ability in you a
[1:32:35] predestinated seed that within that
[1:32:37] curse there's something in you that's
[1:32:39] drawing you that God wants to bless
[1:32:43] you Prophet said when I was born a
[1:32:45] Charles and El branam in there nature I
[1:32:48] was a sinner I came to the world liar
[1:32:52] and all the habits of the world laid
[1:32:53] right in me but down in there
[1:32:56] too was another nature present
[1:33:00] predestinated was in there by God in
[1:33:03] this same
[1:33:05] body two
[1:33:11] Natures my think of
[1:33:13] Jacob Jacob was a
[1:33:17] Shyer he was a coward brother Brenham I
[1:33:20] think we'd call him lazy a mama's boy a
[1:33:22] but regardless of how bad Jacob
[1:33:26] was
[1:33:28] yes the Bible says Jacob ha I loved and
[1:33:33] Esau have I hated for the children not
[1:33:35] yet being bored neither having done any
[1:33:38] good or evil that the purpose of God
[1:33:40] according to election might stand not of
[1:33:43] works but of him that calleth oh there's
