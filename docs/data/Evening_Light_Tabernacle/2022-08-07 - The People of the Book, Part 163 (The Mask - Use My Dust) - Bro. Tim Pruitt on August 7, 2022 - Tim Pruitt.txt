just a man that's all i can do is just lord stand here before your people open up the scripture and then open up my mouth and but then it takes you lord to speak lord may the spirit speak today in the

to let you be seated just a moment man it's good to have each one of you and the house of the lord today and appreciate some of those that are here left over from the wedding that we just had and i'm glad to have you today from wherever you're from that the lord will bless you in a special way and be with you and give you travel and mercies on your way home and thank you to the home group for all the different ones that helped out and made that possible as we as we married off one of one of our children amen and so we ought to look at that like that as these young people as being ours and uh given them a wonderful send-off i want to say thank you also um we have here today um brother matthew sister mary and sister hannah dexter i'd like them to stand right now they have made their home here just moved in got in last night god bless you amen hallelujah thank you very much we appreciate you and welcome you to here to be a part of the family of eden light tabernacle amen and also we want to say that um we appreciate each one of you and love you very much um you know we had a really nice neat um experience there at the end of the wedding at the throwing of the bouquet but i thought i'd make it um official today we have andrew and sarah beth who have pledged to be married so if they'll if they'll just come now you know i think it was a year ago today i i are right at this time that i actually um announced adriana's um engagement so here we have now you know just one after the other has fallen of timothy's children katie watch out amen so we got a few more years for our little katie but you know um i'll tell you what time moves on doesn't it amen when the patton family was talking about moving here i gave him a little advice i said you want to when you when you're moving somewhere you want to make sure that you're you know going to be putting down roots there because your your children will be marrying perhaps uh young men from uh because they're they're all girls there you know so all of sam's and melinda's children are girls so i said you know they'll be marrying young men here and perhaps and you'll be putting permanent roots down so you want to make sure wherever you're going that um that you realize you're going to be staying there for a while you're going to have deep roots and so the lord has blessed us i've known the patton family for many many years we go back oh my goodness way back to the 60s with the goths and then the patents and and uh you know it just as a time goes on we get closer and closer and our families get larger and larger and and we reach out and encompass uh even more more people you at evening like tabernacle you don't talk about nobody because they're kind to somebody amen so we are we really love and appreciate the lord and god has blessed blessed us andrew we blessed you as a young man and gave you the gift of his holy spirit and then brought into your life now the next best thing to the holy ghost is a good wife and i believe he's given you a good one and we welcome you sarah bethan to the pruitt family and my what a joy that's going to be all together you know it's kind of tradition my brother and i married married um uh sisters and um then um so we our children were double first cousins and timothy and his double first cousin since he didn't have a brother they married sisters and and so you know we're just passing down the tradition now you know luke married emily which is sarah beth's sister and now andrew he's um just just walking right in line amen so uh anyway you know god is good to us isn't he it gives us so many blessings we've never been deserving of all of them but he has sure blessed us so we want to thank god for them today let's just ask the lord's blessings father in the name of jesus we want to say thank you for your blessings to us that you have brought us to this day lord as we held andrew in our arms some years ago and dedicate him to you we didn't know we would be abiding time lord to where that we would be here at this moment announcing an engagement planned marriage but lord you brought us to this day and it's for a purpose and a plan and we want to thank you lord that we're living in that plan and walking out the vision that you have and no doubt in the mind of god back in the before the time would begin in the ages known only to god and the angels you had in your mind this very moment this young couple coming together to pledge their engagement to be married lord it's a sacred thing a sacred thing the world will use this now and say oh my fiancee and they're just shacking together but lord to us it's a holy thing and it's a promise that they've made to one another [Music] but i pray lord that they'll keep this engagement holy and lord it's so easy at these moments to let feelings get out of out of touch but lord i pray that you'll just keep them to yourself lord and keep them pure and holy so that they can be a righteous example of jesus christ lord like we witness moriah and western with their first kiss at the altar you've taught us to keep these things holy lord to keep it sacred and i pray lord that we'll do the same father in these moments as we pledge ourselves to you to serve you thank you for young men and young women that reflect your great glory may lord there be more examples of the same come out of eden and light tabernacle trophies of the grace of god i pray in the name of jesus bless them with your holy spirit and bless their plans and their upcoming marriage protect them i bless them in your name now in jesus name amen bind us together lord blind us together with chords that cannot be broken bind us together bind us together behind us together with love amen amen thank you can you stand together with me as we turn to the book of genesis chapter 18. and we're going to look at the prophecy of abraham that spoke of this end time and end time plans of god and and so let us just look at this today as we prayerfully ask god to minister to us through the word genesis 18 verse 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted his eyes and looked and low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the toward the ground and said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant then i'd like to turn to the gospel of saint luke chapter 17. we'll read there from verse 26 luke chapter 17 verse 26 and as it was in the days of noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all and likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought the soul they planted they lo they build it but the same day that lot went out of sodomite rain fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all and even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and then i would like you to turn with me also to second thessalonians chapter 1 and we will read from verse 4 2 thessalonians chapter 1 and verse 4. so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith and all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which you suffer seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you and you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taken vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day may god bless you can be seated but we read some very interesting scriptures and not only that but prophecies of the last day because the bible tells us as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be when the son of man is revealed and then we see just before sodom burned in genesis chapter 18 and verse 1-3 that we read that abraham received a visitation from the almighty god and there in this appearing here when he looked up and he was watching for him to come remember he was he was the eyes that was looking out the tent representing the church because we have had prophetic eyes in this day to be able to identify the coming of the lord and and the peering of christ among us and so again as he looked there remember he could now see another appearing of the almighty the god had appeared as as elohim and and as revealed himself as jehovah and the divine call and then he would again once again show himself as melchizedek and then come again and and identify himself as the almighty god or else had i but regardless of what how many manifestations of of god that abraham saw he knew always it was the same lord so he when he sees disappearing he knows even though he sees three he knows there is but one lord and so he i he says my lord if i've now found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy from thy servants so it tells us now that of course this is god changing his mask it's the same god all the time he is just changing his mask now we're going to take this one a step further as i spoke on the godhead and god changing his mask the last time i spoke on this a couple of weeks ago so we're going to go we're going to speak on the mask and use my dust now as we're looking at this luke 17 30 tells us that as it was in the days of lot you know god with flaming fire took vengeance on the sodomites who knew not god and and then he said thus he said so shall it be when the son of man is revealed so the son of man we know is the word so here in the end time when the word is restored or and the son of man christ is revealed from heaven with his holy angels we know that it's at that time the fire is going to fall and we're living in the day when of course that we're right on the verge of the destruction of the earth where that the world this time will burn with fire remember that just as god takes the the um uh man through through the water the blood and the spirit so he did the same thing with the earth in redemption of the earth he baptized it in water in the days of noah and then he he shed his blood upon it in the days of jesus and then the fire will come upon the earth to cleanse it from all sin now so you see these these to abraham was not multiple deities but it was the same god just changing his mask now jesus does the same thing when he reveals himself in his sonship he will come in various different administrations and in these administration he comes in three sons names now he comes as son of man that is god the god prophet he comes as son of god that was him as the holy ghost through the seven ages and then he comes as the son of david and in the millennium jesus will be his with his bride and will reign with him and he will be the son of david so he comes in three sons names that son of son of man son of god and then son of david now this son of man of course is used many times in the old testament and and it always is referring to man's flesh or the dust and god called the prophet ezekiel's son of man 93 times and this is where it gets so identified with the prophetic office in this way you see god was actually simply calling ezekiel a human being it literally means son of dust man is adam or who came from the dust right so when he's saying son of man he's saying son of adam or son of dust and so it literally means son of dust so son of man is an indirect term for human god became man or human in jesus christ and for he was truly a human being yet he was fully man yet he was fully god god literally came in the flesh his body was a temple for the fullness of god for the father to dwell in that body hence he was called the son so now just as god gathered the dust and made a body and dwelt in it there in the days of abraham think of this god came down in human flesh he would sit down under the tree he would eat a meal with him he would talk face to face with abraham as a friend are you with me now so in in this to do this god gathered dust and made a body and stepped in it and he came down for just a few hours now to visit with abraham and he's revealing himself in death as son of man so he is revealing himself in dust and he is he is there explaining to him giving him the revelation for the end time how that sodom would be burned how that there would be a people called out amen that would be saved a matter how there would be an abraham's group that would not be a part of sodom and they would receive the promised son in order to do that their bodies would be changed and so all of these things were fitting in the prophecy as god was using abraham to prophesy of end time events now so just as god gathered us in the days of abraham maim a body and dwelt in it even so the dust of the man called jesus was made for the purpose of god so that he could become flesh for redemption now so while jesus was here he he he seldom referred himself as son of god only five times in john's gospel throughout the bible did jesus refer to himself others did refer to him devils referred to him as son of god you know see our our pilate would ask are you the son of god all of these other but jesus only referred himself five times as son of god but he refers himself as son of man 88 times in the new testament son of man would be the primary title that jesus used when he referred to himself now and of course this this is because son of god speaks of the holy spirit for god is a spirit and to be son of god is the spirit that came out of him but son of man in contrast it focuses on the humanity of jesus christ and his work as the god prophet the seer so here he would come in a in a visitation of god coming down and this time not just not just coming down for a few minutes and or a few hours and sitting there to uh under an oak tree but now god would come and tabernacle with man amen he would he would he would come as a baby god gathered again the dust for god to come and live in and then that baby would come on up and there he would reach this point in his ministry just before that he would go into his ministry he would be baptized with the holy ghost and the father would come and dwell in him heaven and earth there would be united together and reconciled together because man and god had been separated because of sin but in the man christ jesus now heaven and earth comes together again this time for the purpose of redemption amen so that he could start a new race amen that he could start a new race in which he would use other dust to give praise to his name [Applause] now so again just before the before the fire falls as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now who is the son of man he is the word that's who jesus was he was the word made flesh amen so even thus shall it be when the word that is revealed and it would be revealed where in human flesh amen so now again just as he appearing to abraham was the fullness of all his previous revelations oh my he had received a divine call came out of the earth the chaldeans he had received the blood offering and and taught how to worship and then he would meet the el shaddai and all all of these great experiences and previous revelations was was wonderful but now here was the fullness of it and in the fullness of it it would would be revealed and that's exactly what happened with christ there had been many appearings of god he appeared in moses he would appear in the in joshua he would appear down to the ages and he would use men he would anoint that dust because he couldn't dwell in that dust because the blood had not been shed for god to dwell in man but once but notice he would come and he would anoint us to speak his word you think you think of this moses dust calling using the word of god calling out of dust creating out of dust flies fleas plagues everything else coming because a man was so anointed his dust became so anointed with god until god used the lips of dust now this same thing happens in the end time because again the fullness as it was in christ becomes now to where we are not in a partial revealing of christ we are now in the fullness of the revealing of christ you talk about revival friends there's been revivals before but this is not just another revival this is the fullness of all of the revivals amen god pouring out his spirit so you see the same thing happens as god reveals himself the word is revealed the mysteries are made known the word becomes flesh but this time in bright form and then that dust becomes glorified you can look at your dust this morning and you can know that it's going to be glorified [Applause] and then once it's glorified it's going to be translated amen it'll appear and then it'll disappear amen so you see the word the word becomes flesh in the bright form and the and he will be glorified in his saints in the same day that is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels now the revealing of the son of man that's christ is god god would do that he would reveal the son of man and it would be a prophet or a son of man to reveal the son of man and the son of man christ was revealed then through a prophet but the revealing of the son of man is much more than that this is where our mistake has been we're we've been able to see the prophet and the prophetic office but i want to i want to get bring that a step further and realize the son of man is still being revealed [Music] amen the christ is now still being revealed in dust amen now here in this end time before the fire fall god's appeared now now his appearance not his coming he's coming we'll meet him in the air but god appears and where he's appearing is in bright form amen now in his bride that just like in abraham's camp there was a seer abraham was a prophet amen he was the eyes of the body and the seer catches the revelation from god and reveals a mystery to the bride body and the bride has eyes to see and ears to hear what the spirit is saying because there is a prophet a seer in the midst i want you to understand you see things today that you had never seen except to the eyes of that eagle [Applause] amen except for a prophetic anointing and a prophetic office unless it changed from reformer to profit because we've had reformers down to the ages but in this day it changes from reformer because god's not reforming a church to prophet because god's stepping into a church amen so the appearing of the lord abraham it would confirm to him the coming of the soon coming of the son isaac the promised son it would show him the salvation of lot the church it would show him the destruction of sodom in the appearance of jehovah to abraham was the revealing of the mysteries remember he's not just coming he's not just appearing just to show up he's doing something he's bringing a faith to turn our hearts toward the revelation toward the coming of the promised son toward the preparation before the firefalls come on somebody now it's been the dispensation of the son of god the holy spirit down through the church ages and and that was because it was giving portions of his spirit there would be a portion given of justification that was a holy ghost to luther and then there would be a greater portion of sanctification and gifts of the spirit but then in the last day the dispensation changes amen with the fullness of that same spirit with power with demonstration and with revelation now the same holy spirit reveals himself in the final outpouring of the spirit before the promised son comes in the dispensation of the son of man christ is revealed not just to his bride but in his bride [Music] amen now the revealing of the son of man i want to get this to you the revealing of the son of man is not the revealing of brother branham it is the revealing of the word the word coming to a prophet amen the man who held the office of the prophet is gone but i want to declare to you the prophet is still here oh don't let that go over your head now amen you know i want to say it again the man who held the office of a prophet amen it's gone god took him home been gone for nearly 60 years but the prophet is still here the son of man is the same holy spirit that worked down to the ages but now with the prophetic administration same holy ghost that was in luther wesley azuza street but now here in the fullness with a prophetic administration and as long as the holy ghost is here the prophet is still here amen now the way of a true prophet brother branham said this heavenly father speak again roar forth lord with the holy ghost he is the prophet of the hour he is the prophet of the day trying to find his way into the hearts of men and women that he could speak truth and i'm sure i'm so glad he's finding some aren't you glad he found you amen but you see the holy spirit he said is the prophet of today and he's trying to find his way in the hearts of men and women that he could speak truth and then again he tells us an investment he said jesus said in these days he which is a personal pronoun he the holy ghost when he has come upon you come to you he will show you these things that i have taught you and will show you things to come remains the same thing the holy spirit is the prophet among us today the holy spirit is the prophet anointed one's in the end time the holy spirit is the prophet of this hour he is vindicating his word proving it now of course when brother branham was here he held the office of the seventh angel and as malachi 4 the elijah prophet he was definitely in the office of a prophet but i want you to know that was never his revelations [Applause] that was never his mystery truce that was never from the mind of a man that was the mind of almighty god speaking through a man god used his guest to be able for us to identify god's appearing in this last day now so he the holy spirit is the prophet of the hour and i just want to declare to you again the prophet is still here and man he is the holy ghost and his son of man he is still using flesh to appear in now the mysteries of god are revealed only to a prophetic class of people i want you to understand something our book is the closing book of the bible that was specifically to us nobody else would understand the messages to to ephesus myrna who their messengers was and all the way down to the end of the church ages nobody else would understand the mystery of the seven seals it was something that was hid and the book was closed somebody with me amen so again this is why the book of revelation is the bride's book and why the understanding comes only to her i know that sounds exclusive but jesus made it pretty exclusive he said it's given to her to know the mysteries of the kingdom jesus said this is why i speak in parables this is why he made a parabolic book the book of revelation it would be symbolic it would be in parables it would not be understood until the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound to the last church age amen and then and then then he would he he would make it known but until then it's just parables it's everybody's guess that's why we got hundreds of books written on the book of revelation and every one of them are different because why it was god used symbols because it wasn't given for everybody to know god reserved it to an end-time people i want you to understand you are a special elected group of people where god is doing something more than what he's done in previous ages for in this age is the fullness of god made known amen where others partly had him partly understood him partly revealed now in the evening time it shall be light light will shine on scripture that has never shown them before things that were kept kept and made silence don't reveal it it'll be made known in the days of the seventh angel you realize if brother branham did not reveal the seven thunders that he could not be the the messengers of of revelation 10 7. come on somebody if that was not revealed to him he was not the messenger amen now then if it's not made known to you the right people you're not the bride [Applause] think about it it's your mystery it's your revelation it's your truth that is given to bring a change to your body hallelujah amen so the mysteries of god are revealed to a prophetic class i'm talking about the bride now she's not just any class she's a prophetic class she's not a justified class or sanctified class or gift class she is what she is wherever mystery has been made known to her she's a prophetic class let's go to matthew chapter 13 verse 10. and the disciples said in him why speaketh thou to them in parables now this is why he said why did you why didn't you just write this you know why didn't god take the book of revelation and say now look i'm going to explain this here uh ephesus that's a city in asia and smyrna but they're all representation of ages that will come and there's going to be 2 000 years between my coming and my return and you're going to go through seven church ages and at the end of those ages i'm going to come back why didn't god just show out the whole plan because satan had done a lot of damage with it you see if he had showed back then that it would be 2 000 years then what if what the church would have been relaxed lethargic oh well you know we might as well just tarry till it comes just just think of what the effect that it's made on you as you have carried for a while and how the emphasis is changing from from um waiting or looking and with expectation for his coming to waiting for his coming what happens in the wake people lose faith they get distracted they look at other things come on somebody amen so again satan would have done great damage with it so when he wrote our book he wrote it in mysteries and these mysteries could not be revealed until a prophetic class came who can understand them and in that day the son of man the word would be revealed [Music] now so he said why do you speak to them in parables he said unto them because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them is not given so now i want you to get to stop just a minute it's not given to everybody and even in that day it wasn't given to everybody it was abraham and his group abraham and sarah their 300 or whatever it was you know that little group received the revelation we're going to get a body change we're going to have a promised son amen sodom's going to burn lot's going to be called out the mysteries would be revealed to what a little group you know why because they were the friend of god not a friend of the world a friend of god listen just for a moment john 15 15 jesus even said from now on or henceforth i call you not servants we're not just slaves of a church we're not bondswomen i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what this lord doeth but i have called you friends here's the definition of friend for all things i've heard of my father i've made known unto you and if you look in james chapter 2 verse 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which said that abraham believed god it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he for and he was called the friend of god so i want you to get it he's not revealing himself to everybody this is an unveiling of god but he's not unveiling himself to everybody he's unveiling himself to his friends amen now in the appearing of the lord to abraham he had come to reveal the mysteries of the end time plan now not only was he revealing the end of sodom and the end of sarah's baroness and the coming son but he was actually using that to prophesy of the end time now and he does this friend to friend he comes down and sits with abraham under the oak tree as a friend he reveals things to abraham as a friend seeing you're going to inherit all things seeing that you're going to be a great nation seeing who you are i'm going to show you what i'm going to do now if you think of this in christ the mystery brother brandon said god's great mystery what the eternal god had as a mystery has now been unfolded in jesus christ and then given right down to his church what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ jesus making love to the church his bride whispering secrets to her you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and you get her up next to you and love and everything you know how it is that's what christ god christ is doing to the church he's letting her know the secrets not these flirters he says i mean his wife amen now but how by having the revelation of his secret made known to him by his grace i want you to know that's grace that's been imparted to you that's the mercies of god being imparted to you amen so what what is it now why won't the word outside them receive it because they got ears and they wanted he came here and they got eyes but they didn't see because they set him up amen isaiah said they couldn't see the last church they said they would be blind now let's go to isaiah 29 and verse 10. let's just look at this in this bible prophecy for the lord had poured out upon you the spirit of of deep sleep and as close your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers has he covered so here is the darkness comes god allows the darkness in this end time and it will close it'll be a spirit of deep sleep upon the people and i tell you it was the same with you just like it was with zachariah somebody help me preach now in the book of zechariah what was it there were things that was already there but it took an awakening of an angel and when he was he said he awakened me as a man is awakened out of his sleep that's what god did in this day he sent a message to you who was sleeping just like the foolish was sleeping but god wouldn't let you sleep on come on there was a midnight cry that said behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him and it stirred you from your slumber [Applause] hallelujah when zachariah's eyes was open he said and i saw seven golden candlesticks and he said i saw them all feeding from olive trees a direct fly a direct line from the olive trees itself amen never runs out amen the fire never goes out the supply is unlimited the supply will never end are you with me hallelujah why it's an unlimited supply and he said i'm telling you the supply of the oil the holy spirit is unlimited it'll do beyond what you can think or ask it'll cause your body to change and great hair go back the right color and the wrinkles will fall off your face and you'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye [Applause] but he said the lord has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep close your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers has he covered this is a condition people are trying to understand what's happening what's happening over here in ukraine and why is russia doing that and they can't they can't see the movement of of rome and what's going on here in the condition of the church why is it they're seers he have covered they're prophets and rulers he have covered his closer eyes he's allowed a spirit of darkness to come out in this last day as he gave in revelation 9 said i saw a star fall from heaven and the hymn was given the key to the bottomless pit and out of there there was smoke that rose out of the bottomless pit somebody with me and that because they're blinding delusion and the last day there is not not just a few people following the prophet that's going to be deceived the whole world is going to be the seed the bible said every person whose name is not on the lamb's book of life will be deceived [Applause] so we're talking about a whole cell deception even the crowning of satan after the bridegroom will be looked on as a good thing they will actually invite satan to have rule over them for the lord has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and close your eyes the prophets and your rulers and the seers has it covered look what happened down in sodom what happened they went bond the preaching of the word brother branham said caused them to go blind and the preaching of easy believism has put so many to sleep [Music] but you're not of that amen you you are you are there where there is a prophetic class of people with eyes that can see and ears that hear what the spirit is saying to the church look at verse 11 and the vision of all has become to you as the words of a book that is sealed which men delivered to one that has learned somebody that is educated come from the seminaries and says read this i pray thee and he says i cannot it's sealed and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i prayed and he says i'm not learned i don't know what this means i don't understand what this book is saying i don't see i don't see any thing i mean you know men said uh john had a nightmare or he ate something that night it just made him made him sick and he had illusions we can't understand it and to learn it those from a seminary so well hey we can't read this we're not sure about what it says because you know we just don't know we're learning we're in the seminaries but even we don't understand it and those that that are not in the seminary that has not learned said i can't do it i've never been to seminary i have no clue what's in this book but it's the bride's book and it's given to somebody god didn't put it in the bible just for it to occupy a little space at the end of the bible he did it for the end time people where there would be an appearance of god and his fullness poured out and the son of man would be revealed so he says wherefore the lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth their lips do honor me but they have removed their heart far from me and their fear taught to toward me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept but man this this is what he said here they got ears but they're not here they can't they don't have the ability here they're not they're not of a prophetic class not of available who would burn he could not see the destruction that was going on he cannot see the sin that would so contaminate his family until his daughter's there without have this wild idea after it's all over and they're saved out of it to have children by him you know they he could not see it going that direction but aren't you glad today you can see what direction the world is going and you don't have to look at cnn or fox news to know it some of you are worried about looking at the news and keeping up with the news keep up with the news look right into this book it tells you who you are where you're from and where you're going now so brother branham tells us he said the book of revelation has more symbols than all the rest of the books of the bible more symbols because it's a book of prophecy and you know if it's a book of prophecy then it takes a prophet to reveal it it is a prophetic book therefore it's not un it has to be understood by a prophetic class this book is not meant for everybody there's nobody can understand it hardly the book is made for a certain class of people look at look at them look at the world today wow the seven seals we don't know what they are they're not revealed the seals aren't open the mysteries are not made known as them in any denomination are you with me amen it's not known it's still a sealed book but not to you the seals have been removed and the book is now open to you hallelujah and every mystery of god pertaining to the bride has been revealed to the endtime people through an open book that's why we preach we are the people out the open book not the seal of the book but the open book so he says this book's not meant for everybody there's nobody can understand that the book is made for a certain class of people all and over in deuteronomy he said the hidden things belong to the lord that's right he reveals him to his children the hidden things so if you look in deuteronomy 29 29 you'll see where he's pulling us from the secret things belong to the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever that we may do the words of the law isn't that amazing the secret things belong to god and he held them in his mind for how many years until the last day and then a disappearing he would come and share with his friends hallelujah his elect also called his bride a prophetic class he would share with him the mysteries and they're no longer mysteries that's why i say i hate me to hear mystery preachers preach because when they get through it's still a mystery we don't preach mysteries we preach revelation [Applause] amen but jesus said in matthew 11 25 he said i thank the o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and the prudent and has revealed them unto babes amen everyone who's been born again had to be a baby so to the born again is the one he reveals them to now the carnal mind cannot come back come comprehend the great things of the scripture it's just foolish to them you know but the ones that are the lovers of the word that's who wrote the book and that that's excuse me that's who the book was written to to the church those that are lovers of the word those that are friends of god those who say i'm not a bomb slave i'm not at the bones woman i'm his friend and as his friend he reveals all things now first corinthians 2 14 but the natural man receiving not the things of the spirit of god for their foolishness unto them neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so the only way you're going to know is by the holy ghost paul would say in this same thing he said they the princes of this world was blinded therefore they crucified christ because had they known it they would have never crucified the lamb of glory so brother branham tells us in the church age book as he starts in on the revelation of jesus christ he said you remember i mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we're studying is actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then i mentioned it it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we fail to get it bringing these thoughts together you see you will see it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real is going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means that this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse so that's good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear so how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know this is why brother branham said we ought to call on god for revelation more than anything else this is why abraham's sitting in the tenth door looking out watching for the appearing that's what prophets do and i'm talking to a prophetic class they have an expectation oh my we we ought to have a more expectation of just being a church just occupying the pew being a denominational member come on somebody we ought to have a greater expectation than that we ought to be expecting him lord come walk with me as a friend and reveal the secrets of your heart whisper the love secrets to me i tell you what if you sit with your eyes open you'd get a revealing even in this service amen if you get and shake off the sleep of laodicea you'd get an awakening and then you would begin to see things now the same fullness of god would be in dust again but this time not as one man as it was with jesus but in the flesh body of his bride i want you to understand because the son of man will be revealed in human flesh not just brother branham but in the the bride body the flesh of the bride i'm going to share with you some things today from that but you see in the in the in the the prophecy of abraham god gathered potassium calcium and cosmic light and clay and all the elements needed to made a body and he stepped into it are you with me now we we too have grown up through the ages and god has been gathering elements to make a mature bride that he's going to step into amen he found a little justification with luther a little sanctification with wesley it's like the wheat plant growing up from seed to stalk into tassel to shop and back to seed again you see the fullness of the life comes back into the seed it's where the fullness of god becomes revealed one more time at the end time the gospel started out with christ as a seed and it must end with the brighter christ is the seed this is why i keep telling you over and over again you know we look for the coming of christ but he's got to come in pride form for there to be a people to meet him in the air so before he can come there he's got to come in you first so this is where he's pouring out his spirit is in a bright people now watch him proven his word he said you believe we're living in the last days the son of man was to be revealed or manifested that would be all the word gathered up through luther wesley baptist all of that the pentecostal gathered up into the revelation of what has been the seventh sea the seventh angel was to open the sixth seal mystery it's ought to be gathered up into the son of man listen all of this gathered up into the word all this gathered up into a bride all of this manifesting christ the son of man his time of fullness has come to the fullness of his word to manifest the fullness of his body that's the word then that was spoken the spoken word made manifest by the word and again he said there is no leaven among you in other words it's not a mixed-up message it doesn't have creeds of man and dogma is a man you know why you want it that way because leaven there makes it a little more platable a little more pleasing but god said in my communion it's unleavened bread there's nothing mixed with it it's this pure word it may be a little more coarse and a little harder to get down but it's pure word there's nothing added to it nothing taken out of it unleavened bread are you with me amen and he said no leaven among you and he said that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you no leaven nothing mixed in it and that brings the fullness of the god hit body among you couldn't do it in lutheran's age couldn't do it wesley's age couldn't do it in pentecost but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back to the church to brought back the church together with the entire deity of god amongst his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on earth in the form of a prophet god glory promised by malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures all it has been promised for the last day come on somebody what's he doing bringing the entire deity of god all the word into one body luther had a part wesley had a part but this isn't a part this is the fullness and the fullness of his word comes in the fullness of his church and what it does there it kind of has the same visible signs manifests himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on earth in the form of prophet god so the same ministry of jesus christ repeats but this time it won't be the man of galilee it'll be you you you you and you [Applause] and but not individually but together as the body of christ manifested jesus christ to say yesterday today and forever [Music] that's why we can't deny one word amen now so when when he says he said first to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the guarded body and to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people look what god's doing his fullness not a portion of the word come on church let me describe it like this sometimes an illustration will help but it's kind of like ten blind man ten blind man trying to to describe an elephant and each one of they're all blind and they're all trying to feel you know and find out remember it's the age of blindness and the understanding is not there because you can't see the picture someone goes over here and he he he feels the the the side of the elephant and he said i'll tell you boys what the elephant is it's a big uh rough leathery uh wall another oil gets over there and he's got to hold the tail and last that denomination don't have it they ain't got the truth i tell you i tell you it's a rope that's what an elephant is it's a rope i've got it right here in my hand i got that revelation it's a rope and they you know the other one comes over here and he reaches over he gets a ivy tusk he said you all of you other denominations you're crazy you don't have any truth at all well an elephant is a big it's a hard substance with a lung and and it's got this slick feel and it ends with a point you guys don't know nothing you see they're all seen apart but without eyes they can't see the hope so what god did to you was set and made you a prophetic class of people and sent you a prophet and all that blue sin said in the israel you know there is baptism but it's got to be in the name of jesus christ and there is a trust there is a power of god in the church and it is a wall and it is this it's all of this tied into one message and that's what god did for you brought the fullness of the different appearings into one message [Music] so that you can receive the fullness of god now so god expressing jesus christ who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead on a bodily body now the now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence all that god was just look at what he was he poured into christ he was the psalms of david the wilson of solomon come on the prophecies of the prophets he was all of them joseph would type him out abraham would type him out all of them and he was the embodiment of all of those words the fullness of the word in one body now what i'm telling you that all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he is poured into the church the believers so all the appearings of god in the past are now made manifest in one body called the bride because he's a prophetic class because the prophet is here the eyes now he said in christ it revealed his own word see down to the age we start out from the foundation when the first church age when the seed went into the ground the complete sea then it went out to the feet and luther come out to wesley and then to pentecostal the tongues in the lips and now it's in the eyes the prophetic malachi 4. malachi 4 not just a prophet but turning hearts of the children back to faith giving them the vision seeing god's plan and he said and now and now there's nothing else left for it to come but for himself to step into that hallelujah because that's the last thing there is listen again i want to just say it again the last thing he steps into that amen we've had malachi 4. we've had the prophetic god we've had the tongues through pentecost somebody helped me preach hey man but this is where we're at is now the body is complete and what happens god steps into a people and glorifies their dust he said he's governed the body all the way through but then the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of the bride that was taken out of his side like adams was at the beginning now god in that day had to create a body even in the days of jesus he had to create a body jesus was the creation of god god created in the womb of mary a blood cell live dust collected around that made a body is that right but he doesn't have to create now you see you see why don't have to create because he has now redeemed dust through his blood through the shedding of his blood he has redeemed your blood or he has redeemed your flesh so he can use your flesh in a greater way than he did moses he could anoint that but now he can come and step into your body hallelujah and brother bradley said he can now use my flesh the same as he could create some because he made me anyhow he can use your flesh he created and made you don't you think that now if you'll just open up your heart and get yourself out of the way he'll come in and can use you he's the same god he gives the same signs hallelujah think about that then he can come into you if you'll open your heart he can come into your flesh just like he did coming to jesus come on somebody amen and he said the angel of the lord is here he's jehovah god in your flesh he shall hold the god in my flesh i want you to know brother branham didn't just leave it that jehovah is in my flesh he was not the fullness of the godhead in a body called william branham the fullness of the godhead was not being poured out in one man it was poured out into one body and that body is the church the bride [Applause] now god wants to use your dust that's who she appeared in he's appearing in his church in this last day he's appearing showing the same size that's the same attitude toward the set that he had has the same power the same deity the same god hallelujah speaks in tongues just like they did it sounds just like they did hallelujah sees vicious just like they did and not why because now he's not using that body he's using your body and the ministry of christ is here and it is on display in bride form the son of man what's now in the trial he said i challenge you to believe here's the challenge i challenge you to believe that jesus christ is revealed in this form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body where is he going to be revealed son of man is going to be revealed where through the bride's body oh i i thought you know it was only in brother branham no it's in the bride's body this is where he's revealing himself sure he revealed himself in that prophetic office sure he uses to use his voice but that's not where his voice is now alone it's in a bright elect people amen his earthly ministry continues go with jesus brother branham said i believe his earthly ministry has never ceased because he's in his people now amen we ought to see him the same in every detail except his corporal body amen because now his body is not here we cannot reach out and touch the nail scarred one amen but god can use your body to heal the sick he can use your body to cast out devils he can use you to speak with new tongues prophecy can come through your mouth [Applause] amen spoken words original seed he said the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord she and then it's germatized so the holy spirit waters it till it's grown and serves it purpose they will do only his will amen i believe that no one can persuade them different they have just saith the lord or they keep still they will do the works of god for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he jesus did did not complete all things when he was here for it was not yet time but now his ministry is about to be completed where is he going to be completed in his body in his bride he couldn't do all of that back then come on he had to go away and be an intercessor and but but here he comes again in this last day in human flesh to use your body to make devils obey to cast satan out to speak with new tongues to heal the sick come on church amen why why because it's the maturity of the ages brother branham said it's the same grain that went in the ground the same jesus somebody say same jesus in bribe form the same jesus in bride form not another jesus it's god just simply changing his mask and to think about it in god's great divine drama you are the last players on the stage to bring together the glorious crescendo and the ending of the drama hallelujah we were caught off the stage of this earth and raptured in the glory hallelujah and god chose you to be the last players the last mask that he would use in this end time the same jesus in bride form hallelujah in acts chapter 10 verse 38 god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and with power he went about doing good and healing all that was oppressed to the devil for god was with him the same ministry continues amen why because he has anointed us with the holy spirit in power come on somebody he went about doing good and healing all of those that were oppressed by the devil for god was with him amen so i you know there again brother branham would say he would say about this he said now if he can reveal by my by his holy spirit the resurrected christ who came here and give me a temporary resurrection by my spirit that my spirit goes away and his spirit comes down then let you know whether he's alive or not now i don't know you but that's that's me and my spirit we don't know you but he knows you watch now but he wants to borrow my body to prove he's the resurrected christ and he said i'm so happy to loan it to him give it to him anything he can get out of it that ought to be the same attitude that you have this morning amen he wants to borrow your body he wants to use your mask to display his deity his overcoming power amen and to prove he's a resurrected christ amen amen now this same thing happens you know when we preach the word when the word is preached if a man is truly anointed of the spirit of god preaching the word it's the same thing is god going forth with his own word so through the ages it's been the dispensation of the holy ghost being poured out i'd like to review the book of acts and then joel's prophecy for a moment acts chapter 2 17 for and it should come to pass in the last days how many knows what last days mean so brother tim that's just this day now last days is the last 2 000 years day with the lord's a thousand years and the last days in the seven church ages god has been poured out his spirit and he says i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see those visions your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants of my handmaids i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy now this pouring out of the spirit of god brings restoration now look here in joel chapter 2 verse 3 be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for it's given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you or he will pour out there's going to be outpourings of my spirit the rain the former rain the latter rain the first month what will it do it's going to bring the wheat to harvest and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil hallelujah you know what wine and oil is don't you amen it's revelation of stimulation is that right amen it's the holy spirit it's what god called out and said don't hurt the oil in the wine you leave that alone you're messing with me you take the shout out of the church you're messing with me you take stimulation or revelation out of the church you're messing with me amen don't you touch the oil in the wine are you with me and then this harvest time the floors shall be full of wheat hallelujah and the fats will overflow amen hallelujah amen not just a shout on sunday in this and and it's out on the occasional wednesday but it shout the sight of the king in the church amen revelation and then stimulation of revelation hallelujah oh my goodness church you know when you think about that you you got to realize that we are fulfilling the prophecy of david too david went out to kill a goliath brother brandon said when i went out in the meeting said my last sermon to the church was there's a goliath out there who says the days of miracles are past and there's no such thing as divine healing anymore he said but i'd go out to slay him amen and he said when i slayed him the others took courage and there were men like oral roberts and and and t.l osborne and different ones that they took courage and they went out and slayed giants too amen but it seems like anymore we got to go back and kill the same old giants again now goliath didn't raise from the dead it's just his brothers but there are some david's mighty men that are right here in this church amen that are ready to go out and kill that goliath that says days of miracles are passed and god don't do that anymore amen the baptism of the holy ghost is just an intellectual conception no sir we're not going to take that he said little david god he said david was a dancer and he got to dancing out there and with his sling and he let a little rock go there was a hidden power in it and that hidden power got a hold of that stone and broke the giant down i'll tell you it's about time there's some more dancers hallelujah or people who know their god who people who go out to meet goliath hallelujah who said we're not gonna let that dog stay around here we're taking his head off we're gonna have victory in the church because the son of man is being revealed in bright body let him use my flesh to praise him let him use my glass the swing of stone let him use me to declare his glory hallelujah you believe that this morning amen let's just all stand together and realize where we are at this time god wants to use your body that's where he's now being revealed in a bride body and in that bride there will be signs wonders truths revealed the mysteries of god made known hallelujah things to rejoice over things to shout about amen we're not just an empty bubble dancer amen we've got something to shout about we got something to rejoice about hallelujah and when i'm saudi i'm shouting from a heart that's been washed clean and will i will not run just know i'm running from us from the past that's been redeemed hallelujah and i'm like abraham was when i see him appearing i run towards him amen right leave your paths behind leave sin behind leave pornography behind leave but don't sleep behind leave their own world abusive behind and run run toward him because he's making kiss appearing there's no way to keep us silent every breath is a way to testify [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah you remember with el shaddai you remember what he put that h in sarah's name put that h in abraham's name it was the breath of god he was put in there h
