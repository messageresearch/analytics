[44:05] use my
[44:07] [Music]
[44:17] heavenly father as we bowed before your
[44:19] throne of grace today
[44:22] we find ourselves unworthy
[44:25] in our own merits
[44:28] and the only worth we have
[44:31] is because the blood was shed for us
[44:35] and to think you thought so much of us
[44:38] that you gave your own life on our
[44:40] behalf
[44:42] god so loved the world
[44:44] i want to thank you for loving me lord
[44:48] i'm so glad to be your child today
[44:51] birthed by your spirit
[44:53] washed in your blood
[44:55] filled with your holy spirit
[44:58] it's so precious to us lord
[45:00] and we want to thank you from the bottom
[45:03] of our hearts
[45:05] and lord if we've held back anything in
[45:07] our lives from you we want to give that
[45:09] to you too lord
[45:11] because we want to be totally yours
[45:14] sold out
[45:16] holding nothing back fully surrendered
[45:20] and i'm here today lord is
[45:22] just a servant of yours to wash the feet
[45:25] of your children
[45:26] [Music]
[45:28] lord maybe even by the words that i
[45:30] speak that would wash the dirt off their
[45:32] feet where they walk through the world
[45:36] you will you wash them you cleanse them
[45:39] but today may it just be a great
[45:41] foot washing
[45:43] where you just washed
[45:45] all of the things of the world off our
[45:48] lives where we've walked down the dirty
[45:50] paths
[45:52] for we're in this world but we're not of
[45:54] it
[45:55] and so we ask lord for your cleansing
[45:57] today and you're purging
[45:59] by your blood
[46:01] because if we'll be purged now
[46:03] by your blood
[46:05] we won't have to be purged in the
[46:06] tribulation that is coming and we know
[46:09] it's here
[46:10] we feel the hot whims
[46:12] that are already blowing
[46:14] we see the trouble on the horizon the
[46:17] storm is coming
[46:19] oncoming storms of judgment
[46:21] that are
[46:23] laying in wait for this earth
[46:25] but just as soon as your bride leaves
[46:27] from here
[46:28] the vials will be poured out of judgment
[46:32] those who have rejected your word and
[46:33] been left behind will
[46:35] suffer the consequences of their
[46:38] decisions
[46:39] i pray today that you would speak to our
[46:41] hearts lord
[46:43] that you'd anoint us by your spirit god
[46:46] i'm here lord for a new phase in my
[46:48] ministry
[46:50] a greater anointing
[46:52] i'm looking forward to
[46:54] what you have in the future

[46:58] purpose and we're here to finish the

[52:15] and he received a word from the from god
[52:18] telling us that
[52:19] that we would come down from this
[52:21] mountaintop
[52:23] and we had had mountaintops experienced
[52:25] well there were
[52:26] those who actually
[52:28] uh are not just fly by night um easily
[52:32] mis misled the people but they actually
[52:36] saw the pillar of fire among us and
[52:39] you know things that were happening like
[52:41] that we know he was here you may not
[52:43] have seen him
[52:44] but we know he was here

[52:49] angels of the lord encamp about those
[52:51] that fear him
[52:53] amen and delivers them
[52:56] amen so we're in the moment of great
[52:58] deliverance well we've been down in the
[53:00] valley but we found out that the god of
[53:03] the hills is still the god in the valley
[53:06] that our god is still god no matter
[53:09] where we are
[53:10] and what our situation is amen so it's
[53:13] good to be in the house of the lord this

[53:21] well and i want to thank you for your
[53:23] your prayers and thank the lord for his
[53:26] blessings to us amen
[53:29] john chapter 11 verse 21 is where i want
[53:32] to read from this morning
[53:35] as we just
[53:36] look to the lord
[53:40] amen i don't see anybody here that's
[53:42] really a visitor but
[53:44] anyway uh
[53:45] everybody is is here is just a part of
[53:48] the body so we're just glad to have you
[53:51] here with us today
[53:52] amen
[53:53] look into the lord now as we look into
[53:56] the scripture
[53:57] asking that he would just anoint us by
[54:00] his grace
[54:01] john chapter 11 verse 21 then said
[54:04] martha unto jesus lord if thou had has
[54:07] been here my brother had not died but i
[54:10] know that even now
[54:14] don't you love those words
[54:17] even now
[54:18] whatsoever thou s will ask of god god
[54:22] will give it thee
[54:23] and jesus said unto her thy brother
[54:26] shall rise again
[54:28] and martha said unto him i know
[54:30] that he shall rise again
[54:32] in the resurrection at the last day
[54:35] and jesus said unto her
[54:37] i am the resurrection and the life
[54:41] he that believeth in me though he were
[54:44] dead yet shall he live
[54:47] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[54:50] shall
[54:51] never die believe us thou this
[54:55] and she said unto him yay lord i believe
[54:58] that thou art to christ the son of god
[55:01] which should come into the world amen
[55:03] may god bless this word you can be
[55:05] seated
[55:07] in our scripture reading today we are
[55:10] finding that jesus was standing at the
[55:12] tomb of lazarus
[55:14] and he was about to raise a man that
[55:18] you know his body was already
[55:21] had already seen corruption
[55:24] he had been dead for four days and
[55:26] yet as he even looks at death where the
[55:30] body is corrupted
[55:32] he declares
[55:34] that
[55:35] i am the resurrection and the life
[55:39] and and of course you know he's the
[55:41] resurrection and the life and and and he
[55:44] does in that moment what we all yearn to
[55:47] see and that's not just for one man to
[55:50] be raised from the dead
[55:52] but for all the dead in christ
[55:54] of the gentile ages to be raised
[55:57] now
[55:58] jesus makes clear before the
[56:01] resurrection of lazarus
[56:03] and this can this occasion remember if
[56:05] he if he had not said lazarus come forth
[56:09] and just said come forth then all the
[56:11] dead
[56:12] would have obeyed his voice
[56:14] but already before the resurrection of
[56:17] all the dead
[56:19] you know that would come forth that it
[56:20] would
[56:21] that would raise when he rose
[56:24] jesus announces i am the resurrection
[56:27] and the
[56:28] life and i just want to say today that
[56:32] even so before the rapture and the
[56:35] resurrection
[56:37] of the new testament dead
[56:39] there must be a people
[56:41] who can honestly declare
[56:44] that they are the resurrection and the
[56:47] very life of the word of god
[56:50] now because because the two
[56:54] christ and his bride are one so whatever
[56:57] he does
[56:58] she must emulate
[57:00] whatever word he fulfills she must also
[57:03] in feminine form fulfill the word that
[57:06] has been left for her
[57:08] now many people today you know we hear
[57:12] them saying that they have the token
[57:15] uh you know as if it was some type of a
[57:18] lucky charm or a talisman which
[57:21] when it's obvious that they don't have
[57:24] the holy ghost at all the token isn't a
[57:28] a talisman or a lucky charm at all or
[57:31] just a saying that we say all the way or
[57:33] we've applied the token or we have the
[57:35] token what the token is is the literal
[57:39] life of jesus christ
[57:42] and having his life makes us the bride
[57:46] and it has the bride then we are the
[57:49] life of the word
[57:52] so when we look at that not only is
[57:54] christ the word but his bride is a word
[57:58] bride
[58:00] she also is the word
[58:02] and as he would say as the groom
[58:05] fulfilled the old testament so will the
[58:07] bride fulfill the new testament so we
[58:10] have a word that we must fulfill in this
[58:14] day
[58:15] now you might be just a church member
[58:18] but until you have his life that literal
[58:21] life of christ you can never ever be
[58:24] christ's bride i know we use that term
[58:28] kind of loosely i'm the bride of christ
[58:30] or we're the bride of christ or or but
[58:33] but you cannot be the bride of christ
[58:36] until you receive his life
[58:39] it is that which brings you in union
[58:43] with jesus christ making you a part of
[58:46] his bride but instead of that you're
[58:49] just a dead church member
[58:51] a professor without a possession
[58:54] we got too many of those today
[58:57] amen because we are in the hour of
[59:00] impersonation
[59:01] it is the day of janice and jamborees
[59:04] where that many are rising up not just
[59:07] preachers but lay members as well
[59:10] impersonating christianity when they're
[59:13] not real but i want to tell you in spite
[59:16] of all the faults
[59:18] there is a real bride
[59:21] there is a real holy ghost and there are
[59:24] people that has the real token it is the
[59:27] power of god into salvation
[59:30] [Applause]
[59:33] you say well brother tim what we want is
[59:35] we want an axe to church we want
[59:37] miracles and we want signs and we want
[59:39] wonders
[59:40] well what about the miracle of just
[59:42] living a christian life
[59:46] good would all the signs and wonders do
[59:48] without the miracle of a christian life
[59:52] amen the miracle of being a good husband
[59:55] the miracle of being a good wife
[59:58] the miracle of a marriage of no regrets
[1:00:01] [Applause]
[1:00:02] amen that's exactly right you know
[1:00:05] that's what god wants he wants you to
[1:00:08] emulate him
[1:00:10] a father to emulate his fatherhood
[1:00:13] a son to emulate his sonship
[1:00:16] a husband to emulate him
[1:00:19] a man a a wife to emulate the bride of
[1:00:22] christ him in feminine form this is what
[1:00:25] god wants in this hour he wants more
[1:00:28] than lip service
[1:00:30] he wants more than church attendance
[1:00:33] there's better churches to attend
[1:00:35] there's bigger churches to attend
[1:00:38] there's more fluent churches to attend
[1:00:40] god don't walk church attendance alone
[1:00:43] what god wants is a heart that is sold
[1:00:46] out to him
[1:00:47] a life that is surrendered
[1:00:49] amen completely where they're dead to
[1:00:52] the world and they have been made alive
[1:00:54] in christ that they are the resurrected
[1:00:57] ones
[1:00:59] that's what i'm preaching on this
[1:01:01] morning is the people
[1:01:03] of the resurrection
[1:01:05] in ephesians chapter 2
[1:01:08] he
[1:01:09] tells us right and there and you
[1:01:12] have he quickened
[1:01:14] you have he
[1:01:16] resurrected or made alive
[1:01:19] who were dead in trespasses and sin we
[1:01:22] were all
[1:01:23] born dead
[1:01:24] we needed a resurrection
[1:01:27] amen if you haven't received christ yet
[1:01:29] you need a resurrection
[1:01:32] amen
[1:01:33] where in times past you walked according
[1:01:35] to the course of this world according to
[1:01:37] the prince of the power the heir the
[1:01:39] spirit that not worketh in the children
[1:01:41] of disobedience among whom we all had
[1:01:44] our manner of life
[1:01:46] amen in times past in the lust of our
[1:01:49] flesh
[1:01:50] adriana that's ephesians 3 3 now
[1:01:53] among whom we had our
[1:01:55] our manner of life in
[1:01:57] in times past and the last of our flesh
[1:02:00] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:02:02] of the mind and word by nature look here
[1:02:06] look what kind of nature we have
[1:02:09] by nature we were the children of wrath
[1:02:13] even as others
[1:02:15] sorry we were all born this way
[1:02:18] there's none exempt
[1:02:20] there is none that doeth good no not one
[1:02:23] there's every one of us came here
[1:02:25] needing a savior
[1:02:27] needing a redeemer we need to be safe
[1:02:29] from our own self
[1:02:31] we need to be saved from our pride we
[1:02:34] need to be saved from our selfishness
[1:02:36] all about me
[1:02:38] we needed jesus
[1:02:40] [Applause]
[1:02:44] we were by nature
[1:02:47] the children of wrath
[1:02:51] but that's not the end of the story
[1:02:54] the never the next verse begins with but
[1:02:58] but god
[1:03:01] aren't you glad the story didn't end the
[1:03:04] the verse before
[1:03:05] amen here comes the cornerstone right
[1:03:08] here that changes the whole scene but
[1:03:11] god
[1:03:12] i was a sinner but god i was lost but
[1:03:15] god i was a drunkard but god i wasn't a
[1:03:18] whoremonger but god i was the worst for
[1:03:21] the worst but god
[1:03:23] but god who is rich in mercy
[1:03:26] for his love wherewith he loved us
[1:03:33] he didn't love you because you were
[1:03:34] lovable
[1:03:37] he loved you when you were unlovable
[1:03:40] and think of this
[1:03:42] knowing you would fall and knowing the
[1:03:44] mess you would get in
[1:03:46] he loved you before all of that
[1:03:54] god ain't gonna quit loving his own
[1:04:05] now
[1:04:06] so even when we were dead in sins notice
[1:04:10] our condition dead in sins he hath
[1:04:13] quickened us or resurrected us or made
[1:04:17] us alive together with christ by grace
[1:04:21] are you saved
[1:04:23] oh thank god for his favor
[1:04:28] and he has raised us up notice
[1:04:31] raised us up resurrected us up raised us
[1:04:35] up with him
[1:04:37] together and made us to sit together in
[1:04:40] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:04:44] what words of promise these are
[1:04:47] colossians 3 1 if you then be risen with
[1:04:50] christ
[1:04:51] notice it was not just jesus rose
[1:04:56] he wanted you
[1:04:57] to experience the resurrection also
[1:05:01] you know we all preach about the day he
[1:05:04] raised from the dead
[1:05:06] but what about the day you raised from
[1:05:07] the dead

[1:07:08] so how can i i made it once
[1:07:12] if i can make it once come on
[1:07:15] amen then surely by his grace

[1:07:29] colossians chapter 3 verse 4
[1:07:32] says when christ
[1:07:34] who is our life
[1:07:42] it's christ in our lives that makes us a
[1:07:44] christian
[1:07:46] it's christ in our lives that sets us
[1:07:48] apart from the world
[1:07:51] it is christ in our lives is what makes
[1:07:54] us alive to god and dead to sin
[1:07:58] it is a resurrection to life and now
[1:08:01] you're dead to sin and adultery and
[1:08:04] fornication and drunkenness is all gone
[1:08:07] the old mean
[1:08:09] dominating hateful selfish ways are gone
[1:08:13] you're raised from the grave of sin and
[1:08:16] and left behind jealousy and envy and
[1:08:19] hatred and the works of the flesh and
[1:08:22] raised up with the love of god
[1:08:24] amen with the power to forgive and to
[1:08:27] love your enemies
[1:08:29] amen it'll make a man love his wife
[1:08:32] and give himself for her
[1:08:34] amen this will cause a wife to reverence
[1:08:37] her husband
[1:08:38] and the results will be a
[1:08:40] christ-centered home
[1:08:42] amen with children that will want to
[1:08:45] have the same kind of life
[1:08:50] no not religious quacks
[1:08:54] with religious spirits
[1:08:56] not super-duper christians with the
[1:08:58] pretense of being spiritual
[1:09:01] you know i get sick of people trying to
[1:09:03] impress me with their talks from god
[1:09:05] that are obvious impersonations
[1:09:08] not for real
[1:09:10] it's time to be real
[1:09:15] not legalism either
[1:09:18] or some self-righteousness a self-made
[1:09:22] manufactured holiness
[1:09:25] there's your other extreme
[1:09:28] remember this satan don't care how
[1:09:31] religious you are or how right you are
[1:09:33] in your doctrine
[1:09:34] if you miss that life
[1:09:38] you won't come up anyhow no matter how
[1:09:41] religious how good how many churches you
[1:09:43] belong to or will belong to it doesn't
[1:09:46] matter one thing unless you're born
[1:09:48] again
[1:09:49] that's what our prophet told us
[1:09:52] you see he don't care how religious
[1:09:56] he don't care how many times you come to
[1:09:57] church he don't care how good you can
[1:10:00] sing
[1:10:02] he don't care how much you jump run down
[1:10:04] the aisles if you miss that life
[1:10:07] you have missed everything
[1:10:10] and every person should seek for one
[1:10:13] thing
[1:10:14] let me find that life
[1:10:21] but as brother branham told us in
[1:10:22] ephesians church age people live today
[1:10:25] like this is the only thing there was
[1:10:28] just live here on the earth that's all
[1:10:31] i talked to a man in the barbershop the
[1:10:33] other day
[1:10:34] you know and
[1:10:36] we were we were speaking just a moment
[1:10:38] he asked me
[1:10:40] who i was and where i come from and
[1:10:42] whatever he happened to be a former
[1:10:44] barber in the town and i never went to
[1:10:46] his shop
[1:10:48] and he was sitting down and he was
[1:10:50] talking with me
[1:10:52] and i just told him i said
[1:10:55] all of your life will mean nothing
[1:10:58] unless you meet the lord
[1:11:02] i said i know you've been a barber and
[1:11:04] you've probably been witness to
[1:11:05] everybody in the whole wide world and
[1:11:07] sat down in your chair but i'm telling
[1:11:10] you you don't want to meet god in the
[1:11:11] condition you're in
[1:11:15] you know people go a long life as if you
[1:11:17] know
[1:11:19] and as i explained to him i said you
[1:11:20] should live every day as though this
[1:11:24] would be your last one
[1:11:28] that's the way i preach a sermon as if
[1:11:30] it's going to be the last sermon i ever
[1:11:32] preach
[1:11:34] i want to preach it with everything i
[1:11:35] got
[1:11:36] with sincerity with dedication with
[1:11:39] consecrations
[1:11:41] now he said you don't realize you got a
[1:11:44] soul that's going to leave here and go
[1:11:46] somewhere and you seal your destination
[1:11:48] right here the way you live and the way
[1:11:50] you do out holding grudges and mean and
[1:11:53] everything and then run to church oh
[1:11:55] mercy what's shame on you you bring a
[1:11:58] reproach upon the cause of christ
[1:12:01] he says
[1:12:02] the bootlegger in the hurting the church
[1:12:05] it isn't that
[1:12:07] it isn't the prostitute that's hurting
[1:12:09] the church
[1:12:11] it's the people who profess to be
[1:12:13] christians that's hurting the church
[1:12:16] and he says we know what the bootlegger
[1:12:18] is what the prostitute is but when our
[1:12:20] sisters dress like a prostitute
[1:12:25] that's different that's what hurts the
[1:12:27] church
[1:12:28] when a man drinks like the bootlegger
[1:12:30] well that's what's hurt the church
[1:12:32] they're professing to be a christian and
[1:12:34] they do that and people look for you
[1:12:38] look for you that name in other words
[1:12:39] identify you with that name but let
[1:12:42] every let him that even names the name
[1:12:45] of christ depart from sin get away from
[1:12:48] it oh we're so short brothers me you all
[1:12:51] of us we're sort of what christ wants us
[1:12:54] to be and right here in this day is time
[1:12:57] to lay aside every sin that's easily
[1:12:59] besets us and wrap with patience
[1:13:03] amen the race that is set before us
[1:13:07] amen this is the hour this the time
[1:13:10] is a time
[1:13:11] to quit pretending
[1:13:13] and be real
[1:13:17] pretenders
[1:13:20] we got a lot of pretenders around
[1:13:23] pretenders who have pretended that
[1:13:24] nothing will happen until brother
[1:13:26] branham comes back
[1:13:28] i'll tell you you better hope he don't
[1:13:29] come back you'll get the greatest rebuke
[1:13:31] of your life
[1:13:33] we have pretenders as preachers it turns
[1:13:36] out to be perverts and adulterers and
[1:13:38] drunkards and living filthy lives
[1:13:40] oh yeah
[1:13:42] we have pretenders of being so spiritual
[1:13:44] they can't be led
[1:13:46] we are you know but i want to ask you
[1:13:49] why be a pretender when you can be real
[1:13:53] amen christ is going to have preeminence
[1:13:56] in his church
[1:13:58] amen and he wants to be the lord of your
[1:14:01] life
[1:14:02] amen to be to have lordship is to be the
[1:14:05] ruler
[1:14:07] to be your guide he listen it's not that
[1:14:09] he just wants to possess you in order to
[1:14:12] control you he wants to he wants to take
[1:14:15] over the lordship of your life to keep
[1:14:18] you from the rulership of satan
[1:14:22] because you're going to be under one
[1:14:24] lord or the other
[1:14:26] you can't serve god and mammon
[1:14:31] you can't remain in between
[1:14:34] you are either of the worshipper of
[1:14:36] jesus christ or you're a worshipper of
[1:14:38] satan
[1:14:40] one or the other
[1:14:45] now
[1:14:46] brother branham would say this his
[1:14:47] unfailing faith put him
[1:14:50] jesus in position to know he was the
[1:14:52] perfect born son of god if your faith
[1:14:55] will put you in position
[1:14:58] to know that every divine promise of
[1:15:00] god's bible is for you just as sure as
[1:15:03] that pertain to him every promise
[1:15:05] pertains to you your healing the
[1:15:07] salvation your freedom from sin from
[1:15:10] selfishness from your indifference from
[1:15:13] your little turtle shell you pull
[1:15:14] yourself into
[1:15:16] christ wants to come in and be the lord
[1:15:18] and ruler and set you free from these
[1:15:20] things
[1:15:24] hallelujah
[1:15:26] but i'm speaking today to people of the
[1:15:28] resurrection
[1:15:30] they're not pretenders
[1:15:32] they're not imagining things they are
[1:15:34] not putting themselves on as being
[1:15:36] spiritual and are not
[1:15:38] they're for real
[1:15:40] amen we are the people of the
[1:15:42] resurrection we have been resurrected
[1:15:44] out of cold dark denominationalism
[1:15:47] a people that's been made alive who have
[1:15:49] more than the mechanics
[1:15:52] but to have the dynamics with it
[1:15:54] here brother branham and it is the
[1:15:56] horizon of the sun he clearly tells us
[1:15:59] that for the first time there will come
[1:16:01] forth for the bright age how many knows
[1:16:04] we're in the bright age amen for a
[1:16:07] resurrection out of dark
[1:16:10] denominationalism
[1:16:11] you see you were in a baptist tomb
[1:16:14] or a methodist tomb or a pentecostal
[1:16:17] tomb or a catholic tomb or some of you
[1:16:20] were even in a message tomb
[1:16:24] amen but there has been a resurrection
[1:16:28] out of the tomb
[1:16:29] hallelujah a people who are the first
[1:16:32] one of the ages out from among the dead
[1:16:37] they are the first fruits of the end
[1:16:39] time resurrection
[1:16:42] they are emulating and projecting
[1:16:44] exactly what christ was 2 000 years ago
[1:16:47] the first from the dead
[1:16:50] a people who can say i am the
[1:16:52] resurrection i am the life of this word
[1:16:56] that's who i am
[1:16:59] you see
[1:17:00] now he said they would come forth for
[1:17:03] the bright age of resurrection
[1:17:06] out of dark denominationalism will be a
[1:17:09] message
[1:17:11] a lot of people have a lot of different
[1:17:12] ideas what the message
[1:17:14] is but here's the message
[1:17:17] that the full maturity of the word has
[1:17:20] turned back in full power
[1:17:22] and being waived on the people by the
[1:17:25] same signs and wonders he did back there
[1:17:27] there's the message
[1:17:29] the message is not a powerless word
[1:17:33] it's not a bunch of creeds and doubles
[1:17:35] of man
[1:17:36] the message is life it is a lie it has
[1:17:40] power in it it has life-changing power a
[1:17:44] lot of people are claiming to have the
[1:17:46] message in their life is not changed
[1:17:49] but if you get the message it's a
[1:17:51] message of the full maturity of the word
[1:17:54] is turned back in its full power by the
[1:17:57] same signs and wonders
[1:18:00] and guess what you become the sign and
[1:18:03] the wonder
[1:18:09] the greatest miracle you will ever have
[1:18:12] is your own life surrendered to christ
[1:18:17] because i live you shall live also these
[1:18:20] were the words of jesus because i live
[1:18:22] you shall live
[1:18:23] because i live you shall live speaking
[1:18:26] to his wife
[1:18:27] what a resurrection that was 2 000 years
[1:18:30] ago
[1:18:31] but what a resurrection this is
[1:18:35] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[1:18:37] alive in christ jesus by god's
[1:18:39] quickening power
[1:18:41] now as we think of this
[1:18:44] resurrection jesus said i am the
[1:18:47] resurrection
[1:18:50] and as i said there has to be a people a
[1:18:53] bride in this last day that emulate the
[1:18:56] same thing amen
[1:18:58] and resurrection
[1:19:00] means revival
[1:19:04] that's one word to revive revival
[1:19:07] if you have a resurrection you have a
[1:19:09] revival
[1:19:10] and this bride's revival is the greatest
[1:19:12] revival that ever struck the earth
[1:19:15] amen it's greater than the day of
[1:19:17] pentecost
[1:19:19] because it's the harvest of the wheat
[1:19:21] grain and not his planting
[1:19:23] amen it's rapture time it is bride time
[1:19:28] so we are living in the greatest revival
[1:19:31] that there ever was you say brother tim
[1:19:34] i i don't see any revival well open your
[1:19:37] eyes
[1:19:38] take a look around
[1:19:40] you won't have to look very far just
[1:19:42] look right here look around and see it
[1:19:44] in your neighbor next door you are the
[1:19:46] revival
[1:19:49] amen i once was dead
[1:19:52] in sin's trespasses
[1:19:55] but now i am alive forevermore and i've
[1:19:58] got the keys of death and hell
[1:20:02] hallelujah satan's kingdom can't hold me
[1:20:04] down
[1:20:05] doctors can't hold me down death can't
[1:20:08] hold me down there is nothing that can
[1:20:10] captivate me and hold me captive no sin
[1:20:13] no habit
[1:20:15] no complex can bind me and hold me down
[1:20:19] i am he that was dead but i have risen
[1:20:22] from the dead of sin and i am alive
[1:20:25] forevermore
[1:20:29] and i hold the key
[1:20:35] brother branham would say
[1:20:37] an invisible union of the bride and i
[1:20:40] was there
[1:20:41] when many walked out as he preached
[1:20:44] not liking what he was saying
[1:20:49] as i watched women sit in front of me
[1:20:51] and poke one another and laugh and
[1:20:53] point at brother branham
[1:20:55] as he spoke those things
[1:20:58] but he said something there
[1:21:00] in the invisible union
[1:21:03] the move is on for the bride
[1:21:05] that's dust saith the lord
[1:21:11] when god releases a moon
[1:21:14] it don't stop till it fulfills what he
[1:21:16] sent it for
[1:21:19] and this revival didn't just start
[1:21:21] it began as the sun of righteousness
[1:21:24] shed
[1:21:25] forth the rays of the evening light
[1:21:28] with a divine healing movement
[1:21:31] let me tell you there the sick were
[1:21:33] healed
[1:21:34] and when the dead were raised blind eyes
[1:21:37] was open the death heard cripples walked
[1:21:41] and more than that it brought men and
[1:21:43] women to a spirit-filled life
[1:21:47] amen this revival produces good
[1:21:49] marriages
[1:21:51] wonderful children
[1:21:52] spirit-filled churches
[1:21:56] come on
[1:21:57] i might have saw a picture the other day
[1:21:59] projected there of what things used to
[1:22:02] be used to be a man and his wife laying
[1:22:05] up in bed reading the bible together
[1:22:08] before they went to sleep now they're
[1:22:10] there with
[1:22:11] she's on her phone and he's on his
[1:22:15] [Music]
[1:22:19] that's the that is the temptations of
[1:22:21] this life the snares
[1:22:25] to get caught up in nonsense
[1:22:30] who cares if your neighbor burner beans
[1:22:36] who cares if she was making cupcakes
[1:22:38] today
[1:22:40] who cares if she got a new couch
[1:22:44] we get so caught up and and everybody
[1:22:47] else and knowing what everybody else is
[1:22:49] doing
[1:22:50] instead of what we're supposed to do
[1:22:54] we use the facebook but we don't face
[1:22:56] the book
[1:22:59] it's time we be real
[1:23:02] we're in the last hour we're in the last
[1:23:04] days are you with me
[1:23:06] amen this is where we are this is the
[1:23:08] time that we're in and we must realize
[1:23:11] that we cannot be impersonators and
[1:23:13] put-ons we have pretenders we've got to
[1:23:16] be for real
[1:23:18] amen we are children of the resurrection
[1:23:22] now as i said this this revival caught
[1:23:25] fire with god doing extreme things and
[1:23:29] let me tell you it continues with god
[1:23:31] doing extreme things it brought bible
[1:23:35] days here again
[1:23:37] it's like walking in the bible no longer
[1:23:40] is jesus a god of the past
[1:23:42] but this revival has brought him present
[1:23:46] amen no more do we long for the days of
[1:23:49] elijah these are the days of elijah
[1:23:52] amen these are the days where the word
[1:23:55] spoken the message preached makes dry
[1:23:58] bones live
[1:24:00] and we're in the days of elijah yeah we
[1:24:02] saw him taken from us but the spirit of
[1:24:05] the of elijah that that anointing of
[1:24:08] christ is still anointing the people
[1:24:10] here in this end time
[1:24:12] amen because we are the people of the
[1:24:15] resurrection
[1:24:16] not somebody that's dead
[1:24:18] in sins and trespasses and creeds of men
[1:24:21] but people of the resurrection we are
[1:24:24] not dead just because the prophet is
[1:24:27] gone we are not a powerless group of
[1:24:29] people whose only weapon is argument
[1:24:32] come on we are the elisha group
[1:24:35] amen that follows elijah we're not we're
[1:24:38] not chasing where he went
[1:24:40] we are not looking for him to return
[1:24:43] we are finishing the work that elijah
[1:24:46] did
[1:24:47] amen that elijah commissioned us to if
[1:24:50] you read the bible elisha was left with
[1:24:52] a double portion to finish the ministry
[1:24:56] of elijah
[1:24:59] amen i'm here to finish the ministry
[1:25:02] i i'm not i'm not no no no i'm not to
[1:25:07] crow in and say i'm the one that's not
[1:25:09] it i'm not a part of the great move of
[1:25:13] god
[1:25:17] this bride's revival
[1:25:20] began with vivid proof of the word among
[1:25:22] us
[1:25:23] it divided but thunder between the soul
[1:25:26] and the spirit
[1:25:27] it revealed the thoughts and intents of
[1:25:30] heart
[1:25:31] it continues with god doing the same
[1:25:33] thing
[1:25:35] resurrection also is a restoration
[1:25:38] and that restoration was spoken of and
[1:25:40] prophesied of in malachi 4 to turn the
[1:25:43] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:25:46] of the pentecostal fathers
[1:25:49] and i just wonder you know a lot of
[1:25:51] times we
[1:25:52] we we find people almost uh offensive to
[1:25:56] that you know i i
[1:25:58] we we don't want to go back to the faith
[1:26:00] of the pentecostal fathers but that's
[1:26:03] what elijah the prophet was said to do
[1:26:07] over and over and over we were told this
[1:26:11] is the goal
[1:26:12] this is the purpose of sending elijah is
[1:26:17] to sin turn your hearts back
[1:26:19] to the original faith come on
[1:26:23] amen turning the heart back to the
[1:26:25] original faith of the fathers
[1:26:27] now and that isn't word only because
[1:26:30] paul was clear the word don't just come
[1:26:32] in word only it comes with power
[1:26:36] and much assurance
[1:26:39] now brother branham would be emphatic he
[1:26:41] said god ain't going to plant a new
[1:26:43] church
[1:26:45] but he's going to bring back his
[1:26:46] original planting to original seed
[1:26:50] this is the age of restoration it's the
[1:26:52] age of the finished cycle
[1:26:54] we've come and we made a huge circle
[1:26:58] like eternity is a circle
[1:27:00] and we come back and been brought back
[1:27:02] to exactly where the church started
[1:27:05] to finish the cycle
[1:27:07] it's the age of the venice cycle
[1:27:10] it not only brought healing from cancer
[1:27:13] tuberculosis diabetes and heart trouble
[1:27:17] it healed us
[1:27:19] of 2 000 years of false doctrine
[1:27:23] it brought us back to the faith that was
[1:27:26] once delivered to the saints
[1:27:28] amen it it brought us back you know to
[1:27:32] to truth that healed us
[1:27:34] from the errors of the past
[1:27:37] the thing that would kill luther's
[1:27:40] movement a trinitarian baptism and a
[1:27:43] triune god
[1:27:44] and and the organization the things
[1:27:47] that's killed other movements
[1:27:50] has been healed
[1:27:54] we don't suffer with it no more come on
[1:27:56] amen we have our foot upon it
[1:27:59] we have been made conquerors
[1:28:01] amen the false doctrines of the past
[1:28:03] have been taken away we're back to the
[1:28:06] same gospel that paul preached
[1:28:09] back to paul's gospel and you know what
[1:28:11] peter preached and what paul preached
[1:28:14] bible days bible doctrine bible truth
[1:28:17] bible holiness
[1:28:19] [Applause]
[1:28:21] it's a restoration
[1:28:23] of the apostles doctrine
[1:28:26] but not word
[1:28:27] only but with power
[1:28:30] brother branham would talk about this
[1:28:32] restoration and restoration of the bride
[1:28:34] tree
[1:28:35] and he said to restore
[1:28:37] means to return to the former owner
[1:28:41] so you had to go come from god you had
[1:28:43] to be a part of that
[1:28:45] in order to receive that
[1:28:47] you see to restore means to bring back
[1:28:50] to return to the former owner not or
[1:28:52] bring back to the former estate of
[1:28:55] condition so bring it back former owner
[1:28:57] bring it back to the former estate
[1:29:00] and we can enforce a claim to be
[1:29:04] restored
[1:29:06] now webster says the word restore means
[1:29:08] to bring back the fame former owner to
[1:29:10] bring back to a former stated condition
[1:29:12] if a claim is made on something to make
[1:29:15] that restoration you can enforce it to
[1:29:17] make it come back in its right place
[1:29:21] but the law of the spirit of god is to
[1:29:24] force satan to give up that which he is
[1:29:28] unrightfully deceitfully taken from god
[1:29:33] souls of men he took from god souls of
[1:29:36] women sickness of the body satan placed
[1:29:40] upon people where god made him in his
[1:29:42] image to be like him and the church is
[1:29:44] given the rightful legal rights by the
[1:29:47] bible to take the holy spirit and
[1:29:51] enforce them it upon them
[1:29:55] now i'll tell you i can't help but
[1:29:57] believe in miracles
[1:29:59] because i am a miracle
[1:30:03] amen
[1:30:04] and so is everyone else's born of the
[1:30:06] spirit
[1:30:09] you're a greater miracle than the blind
[1:30:11] eyes open
[1:30:14] your greater mind you're a greater
[1:30:15] miracle than
[1:30:17] than the cripples walk
[1:30:20] amen but i can't help but believe in
[1:30:22] miracles
[1:30:24] because i am a miracle
[1:30:27] you know why i've i've been through a
[1:30:29] season now where the devil has tried to
[1:30:31] convince me that my prayers are and my
[1:30:35] faith is paralyzed and i just want to
[1:30:38] say it is not
[1:30:44] as i just thought about what brother
[1:30:45] branham said in this enforce you know he
[1:30:48] said you can force a claim to make a
[1:30:50] restoration
[1:30:52] i remember some time ago
[1:30:54] it was with brother john lay
[1:30:57] that he was in a condition
[1:30:59] where that he had a nervous breakdown
[1:31:02] and his mind was out there in some land

[1:31:53] that and we were packing dirt around the
[1:31:56] roots of that plant
[1:31:58] while we were on our knees i put my arm
[1:32:00] around him
[1:32:02] and i said god
[1:32:03] my brother's mind is out there wandering
[1:32:06] way out yonder somewhere in the in the
[1:32:09] in the spirit world somewhere

[1:33:15] my face as he talked to me
[1:33:17] and he said preacher
[1:33:19] he interrupted the sermon that i was
[1:33:21] preaching and he said preacher

[1:33:46] baptized in the name of jesus christ

[1:34:37] pentecostal church stacking up with a
[1:34:39] pentecostal boy had kids by three men
[1:34:42] and was living with a man
[1:34:45] she's like the woman at the well
[1:34:48] and to add to her
[1:34:49] her misery she had a religious demon too
[1:34:53] that would hide behind speaking in
[1:34:55] tongues and she'd speak in tongues and
[1:34:57] go get another man but one day
[1:35:00] in her hour of deliverance

[1:35:48] not with no pretense of holiness but
[1:35:50] god's own holiness
[1:35:52] living out of you
[1:35:55] i had a young woman
[1:35:57] as i reflected back for a moment
[1:36:01] i had a young woman with a split
[1:36:02] personality she was bipolar
[1:36:05] she drove up to my house
[1:36:09] she sat for a while in her in her car
[1:36:11] and i waited for her to come in
[1:36:14] my wife was home and
[1:36:15] we waited for her to come in she
[1:36:17] wouldn't come in she just kept sitting
[1:36:19] out there in the car
[1:36:21] so after a bit i went out
[1:36:23] she's still just sitting in the car she
[1:36:25] made no
[1:36:26] no
[1:36:27] offer to speak to me or nothing just a
[1:36:30] stare
[1:36:32] and i opened her door of her car
[1:36:36] and she said you open one door
[1:36:39] i'll open the next
[1:36:42] i got her to come in the house and once
[1:36:44] inside
[1:36:45] i saw she was a lunatic
[1:36:49] she was full of demons she began to
[1:36:50] growl
[1:36:52] and the spirit began to speak up out of
[1:36:54] her blaspheme in the name of jesus
[1:36:56] christ
[1:36:59] but by the power of god in the blood of
[1:37:01] christ
[1:37:02] using his names those demons had to bow
[1:37:05] to the name
[1:37:06] and made her a lovely christian
[1:37:09] lady until god called her home
[1:37:11] you know why i'm talking about that
[1:37:13] because we have resurrection life
[1:37:17] that they take a woman bipolar split
[1:37:20] personality demon possessed a lunatic
[1:37:25] hallelujah and make her a saint of god

[1:37:30] resurrection it's because we are people
[1:37:33] of the resurrection

[1:37:41] actually on video in the prayer line of
[1:37:43] the youth camp
[1:37:45] a young girl that was anointed with all
[1:37:47] the moment i've anointed her with all
[1:37:49] immediately she crossed down like an
[1:37:51] animal growling i won't come out i won't
[1:37:54] come out she was swinging her hands at
[1:37:56] me
[1:37:57] trying to hit me you know just see like
[1:38:00] a beast you know and then her face was
[1:38:02] grotesque but invited by those demons
[1:38:05] and speaking out i won't come out and
[1:38:08] growling at me and swinging at me but
[1:38:10] she couldn't connect
[1:38:13] it seemed as though there was an
[1:38:15] invisible wall between us
[1:38:17] but i'll tell you the rest of the story
[1:38:19] that spirit succumbed to the power of
[1:38:22] the name of jesus
[1:38:23] [Applause]
[1:38:27] i'm talking about the name of jesus i'm
[1:38:30] talking about the resurrection
[1:38:32] i'm talking about the life-giver
[1:38:34] i'm talking about people who were dead
[1:38:37] and sins and trespasses that he
[1:38:39] quickened that he made alive

[1:45:13] brother wayne lawson was preaching here
[1:45:15] that night

[1:47:19] hundreds of them vanished off of the
[1:47:22] body

[1:47:49] amen one service the spirit of god moved
[1:47:52] on his mother saying take that baby for
[1:47:54] prayer and she ran to the altar with her
[1:47:56] baby and that affliction was cursed

[1:48:43] and he said i'm going to make an
[1:48:45] appointment with brother tim and i got
[1:48:47] to talk things over with him but then he
[1:48:49] got real
[1:48:52] said i know i won't do that i'm just
[1:48:53] putting it off
[1:48:55] and down the aisle that he came and
[1:48:57] there god changed his life forever and
[1:49:01] resurrected him out of sin into life and
[1:49:04] has made a preacher of the gospel out of
[1:49:06] him

[1:49:37] i've heard his voice
[1:49:40] oh yeah i know i heard his voice
[1:49:42] the devil can't tell me i didn't hear
[1:49:44] his voice
[1:49:46] there's kenneth middleton sitting back
[1:49:48] there
[1:49:50] a man who could lie better and he could
[1:49:52] tell the truth
[1:49:55] a cheater ladies man oh my he was a
[1:49:57] slicker
[1:49:58] to the point i turned him over to the
[1:50:00] devil this church did put him out
[1:50:03] but god didn't give up on him
[1:50:08] amen god didn't give up on him
[1:50:11] he got down on his back lying in the
[1:50:13] hospital and i went to him said kenneth
[1:50:16] jesus still saves
[1:50:17] and there's hope for you
[1:50:20] hallelujah
[1:50:22] one moment in his presence
[1:50:25] the life came
[1:50:26] oh he had tried church before
[1:50:29] he had been a faithful member before
[1:50:32] he had professions before but this time
[1:50:34] the life giver came in
[1:50:37] life and the old man died
[1:50:40] and the kenneth middleton i just talked
[1:50:42] about don't exist anymore he's dead
[1:50:46] he dead
[1:50:47] he'll live anymore
[1:50:50] amen but there's a new kenneth middleton
[1:50:51] [Applause]
[1:50:56] now don't look a little sanctimonious we
[1:50:58] wouldn't we
[1:50:59] we weren't all saints
[1:51:02] we wasn't all natural-born christians
[1:51:05] ephesians 2
[1:51:07] we we read about a while ago that we
[1:51:09] walked in times past and sins and
[1:51:11] trespasses
[1:51:12] when we were dead and sins he made us
[1:51:15] alive together in christ
[1:51:17] but let me tell you who made up the new
[1:51:19] testament church
[1:51:20] you'll understand who will make up this
[1:51:22] endtime church
[1:51:25] the kind of church that was at the
[1:51:26] beginning god had a church like he
[1:51:28] wanted it
[1:51:30] in the end god will again have a church
[1:51:33] like he wanted
[1:51:35] and this this here the kind of people
[1:51:38] that made up the new testament church
[1:51:41] and they they're the kind that
[1:51:43] you know god has come to say he's not
[1:51:45] come to save good people
[1:51:47] he's come to save his own
[1:51:50] and listen to his own just center all
[1:51:53] kinds of jams and messes
[1:51:55] before they come because satan can see
[1:51:58] there's something different about that
[1:52:00] boy girl
[1:52:02] so he starts working on them early
[1:52:05] trying to cover them up with every kind
[1:52:07] of sin and darkness and unbelief
[1:52:12] the woman at the well was that kind of
[1:52:14] woman she you know she was a
[1:52:17] predestinated seed
[1:52:19] but satan come along and did everything
[1:52:23] so i just wonder about her
[1:52:26] so he gets her down into every kind of
[1:52:28] darkness
[1:52:29] she had physical darkness of having
[1:52:32] having six men and you know the one
[1:52:35] she's living with was not her husband
[1:52:37] five but she had
[1:52:39] lived married and one she's living with
[1:52:41] she wasn't even married to and she just
[1:52:44] really had some real issues
[1:52:46] not only that she was a religious sinner
[1:52:49] it's amazing to me
[1:52:51] how people can be so black
[1:52:54] in their soul and so religious
[1:52:58] so she has all of these questions for
[1:53:00] jesus
[1:53:02] you know about word of worship
[1:53:05] what to do
[1:53:06] you say this nathan we say this and what
[1:53:08] do you say and all these other things
[1:53:11] she was she was ready to argue the
[1:53:13] gospel
[1:53:15] defender position
[1:53:18] a sinner
[1:53:20] and jesus began to discern her heart and
[1:53:23] told her what her trouble was
[1:53:27] because why
[1:53:29] there was a divine appointment for her
[1:53:30] life
[1:53:32] and there
[1:53:33] they're standing there
[1:53:35] she met the life-giver
[1:53:39] one moment in his presence
[1:53:41] she threw her water pot down and man it
[1:53:44] wasn't so important anymore and here she
[1:53:46] runs to go tell come see a man
[1:53:49] who told me the things i've done isn't
[1:53:51] this the very messiah
[1:53:57] first corinthians 6 and 9 know you not
[1:53:59] that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[1:54:01] the kingdom of god
[1:54:03] be not deceived neither fornicators
[1:54:06] nor idolaters nor adulterers
[1:54:09] nor feminine
[1:54:12] or abusers of themselves of mankind
[1:54:16] nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards
[1:54:19] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[1:54:22] inherit the kingdom of god none of these
[1:54:24] shouts
[1:54:28] looks pretty today i'm pretty hopeless
[1:54:30] on it
[1:54:32] but then the next verse says
[1:54:34] and of such
[1:54:36] were some of you
[1:54:40] but you are lost
[1:54:43] but you are sanctified
[1:54:45] but you have been declared righteous
[1:54:47] justified in the name of the lord jesus
[1:54:50] and by the spirit of our god
[1:54:52] i'm glad the other wasn't the end of the
[1:54:55] story i'm glad there was a conjunction
[1:54:57] that said and that was some of you but
[1:55:00] you are lost
[1:55:03] sanctified
[1:55:04] justified
[1:55:05] [Applause]
[1:55:10] kenneth became a lovely christian
[1:55:13] he's read his bible from cover to cover
[1:55:15] over 50 times now most of us can't say
[1:55:17] that i can't
[1:55:19] he's listening to every sermon that
[1:55:21] brother branham's now several times over
[1:55:24] and the devil's tried to kill him with
[1:55:25] cancer
[1:55:27] with heart trouble he's crippled him up
[1:55:30] but he can't stop him from loving and
[1:55:32] serving jesus
[1:55:36] all them things and he stopped him
[1:55:39] amen but having lived such a sinful life
[1:55:41] one day he was wondering if jesus loved
[1:55:44] him
[1:55:45] he said jesus
[1:55:46] i know you love me
[1:55:49] but if you could just somehow tell me
[1:55:52] that you love me
[1:55:55] he was drinking some
[1:55:56] tea
[1:56:00] down to the end of it he's sitting by
[1:56:01] this telephone
[1:56:03] there on canvas heist chair stool
[1:56:07] he could at that time still walk around
[1:56:09] just a little bit
[1:56:11] holding on to something
[1:56:13] holding on to the bar
[1:56:16] of the house there he decided to go back
[1:56:20] and get his tea jug filled up again
[1:56:23] he was walking along
[1:56:25] sliding his cup along sliding this cup
[1:56:28] along
[1:56:29] holding down crippling along jesus
[1:56:32] you know i love you
[1:56:34] but if you could just tell me
[1:56:36] it's somehow another you could just tell
[1:56:38] me
[1:56:39] that you love me
[1:56:40] would you like to hear him say it
[1:56:42] sometimes
[1:56:44] he said it means so much to me you
[1:56:45] wouldn't have to do it lord you've told
[1:56:47] me in your word you love me and all that
[1:56:49] but if somehow you could just just make
[1:56:51] it personal to me
[1:56:54] at that moment as he walked back around
[1:56:58] there and he
[1:57:00] he
[1:57:01] got back to his chair and
[1:57:04] and he sat down took a drip a drink of
[1:57:07] his tea and said
[1:57:08] hey man
[1:57:10] and as he finished his prayer the phone
[1:57:12] ring
[1:57:13] and i was down in my barn there doing
[1:57:16] some chores in the morning
[1:57:18] and the voice of god spoke to me said go
[1:57:21] call kenneth middleton and tell him
[1:57:23] these words i love him
[1:57:27] and on the other end of the line when he
[1:57:29] answered i said brother kenneth i don't
[1:57:31] know what's going on but i want you to
[1:57:33] know god just spoke to me to tell you i
[1:57:37] he loves you
[1:57:40] amen that's it you see sometimes we
[1:57:43] think oh we've done so much and we made
[1:57:45] so many mistakes and god couldn't love
[1:57:48] me he's a personal god and a personal
[1:57:50] savior he'll go to the extreme to get
[1:57:54] his children
[1:57:55] [Applause]
[1:57:56] he'll not lose the one of them
[1:58:00] so i'll just tell you devil
[1:58:02] don't you tell me my prayers are
[1:58:04] ineffective
[1:58:07] hallelujah
[1:58:08] you see resurrection is regeneration
[1:58:12] it means to breathe life into
[1:58:15] it breathe life into the bible
[1:58:18] it makes scriptures that lay dormant for
[1:58:21] centuries come alive
[1:58:23] amen but it's more than the written word
[1:58:26] now a lot of people think oh the the
[1:58:28] message is the word the word to work it
[1:58:30] you know it's more than a written word
[1:58:32] it's more than tapes is more than books
[1:58:34] it is more than the than the logos the
[1:58:37] written word it's the rhema the word in
[1:58:40] action
[1:58:42] and god breathed life into malachi 4.
[1:58:47] and it became flesh
[1:58:49] hallelujah amen and god sent elijah
[1:58:53] but he didn't just send elijah he sent
[1:58:56] he said i'd send them to you
[1:59:00] you're in malachi 4.
[1:59:02] i send it to you a lie to the prophet
[1:59:06] you see wouldn't do no good to send him
[1:59:08] if there wasn't somebody going to
[1:59:09] receive him
[1:59:11] hallelujah so god breathed a life in
[1:59:14] that scripture and because of life in
[1:59:16] that scripture you are here today
[1:59:18] hearing the message of believing the
[1:59:20] message of malachi 4 because god sent it
[1:59:23] personally to you your message
[1:59:31] god breathed life into luke 17 30
[1:59:35] as it was in the days of sodom
[1:59:38] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:59:40] of man or when the son of man is
[1:59:41] revealed
[1:59:43] 10 7
[1:59:46] where he says
[1:59:48] in the day that but in the days of the
[1:59:51] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:59:53] begin the sound the mystery of god
[1:59:54] should be finished
[1:59:56] now life is also coming to revelation 10
[1:59:59] 8
[2:00:00] that must prophesy again
[2:00:03] as we prophesy again and the voice
[2:00:05] speaks the bride speaks the last
[2:00:08] prophecy
[2:00:10] now remember
[2:00:11] in her voice is life
[2:00:14] it was the voice of the prophet ezekiel
[2:00:17] that was commanded you know to say to
[2:00:20] the dry bones live
[2:00:23] amen and such this bride is the same she
[2:00:26] is the final voice to the final age
[2:00:30] and it will be the voice of god within
[2:00:33] her that actually calls the dead of the
[2:00:36] seven ages from the grave
[2:00:39] now i'm not talking about some who do
[2:00:41] something of going out and waving a wine
[2:00:43] over the cemetery you know raising them
[2:00:45] up i'm talking about when our life
[2:00:48] matches the promise of the hour and we
[2:00:50] fulfill the words that is written of us
[2:00:53] the dead in christ will be called to
[2:00:55] meet us
[2:00:57] because we are are the voice of the
[2:01:01] resurrection
[2:01:03] the people
[2:01:04] of the resurrection
[2:01:07] now
[2:01:08] this word resurrection means to
[2:01:11] revitalize
[2:01:13] to re-energize
[2:01:16] brother branham would say this in wisdom
[2:01:18] versus faith
[2:01:20] that the disciples had it suited to them
[2:01:23] then the spirit came to energize the
[2:01:25] word see
[2:01:26] not by power not by might nor by wisdom
[2:01:30] nor by understanding not by this not by
[2:01:32] that but by my spirit i will energize my
[2:01:36] word
[2:01:37] my spirit saith the lord
[2:01:40] it's the water of the word of faith that
[2:01:43] energizes the word of god and makes it
[2:01:46] work
[2:01:48] so how can you preach doubt
[2:01:51] and energize the word of god
[2:01:53] that kills the word and it makes it
[2:01:55] ineffective
[2:01:57] amen when you preach doubt like he's off
[2:02:00] the mercy seat that's doubt that's
[2:02:02] unbelief that's confusion that's
[2:02:05] darkness it'll never produce faith
[2:02:08] he is not off the mercy seat he ever
[2:02:11] liveth to make intercession
[2:02:14] amen on our behalf he lives to do it
[2:02:18] he lives to take your need before the
[2:02:20] father
[2:02:21] come on church and then when you preach
[2:02:24] that we're we're we're just not in the
[2:02:26] season for miracles you're lying to the
[2:02:28] people
[2:02:29] you're discrediting the promise of the
[2:02:31] word when you project it was only for
[2:02:33] brother branham and not for all
[2:02:35] believers you're projecting doubt
[2:02:37] when you say we're waiting on the third
[2:02:39] pull that's a lie
[2:02:41] we're not waiting on the third pole
[2:02:43] we're part of the third polar phase of
[2:02:45] brother bradley's ministry the third
[2:02:47] pull was the opening of those seven
[2:02:49] seals revealing of the mystery that took
[2:02:51] the seals off the book so every promise
[2:02:53] could be yours we are living out the
[2:02:56] third phase of brother bratton's
[2:02:58] ministry it continues on in the bright
[2:03:00] people
[2:03:02] is it work right now
[2:03:05] resurrection is a reinvigoration
[2:03:07] it means to put stress strength and life
[2:03:11] and heart into
[2:03:14] question answered brother branham said
[2:03:16] this now i'm going on to the holy spirit
[2:03:18] when i get here i'm in the holy spirit
[2:03:20] by baptism is that right what does the
[2:03:22] holy spirit do it gives me power
[2:03:26] power to be a preacher
[2:03:29] what good is preaching without the
[2:03:30] anointing
[2:03:32] what good is preaching with just lecture
[2:03:34] what is it people just getting up you
[2:03:36] know and they got a dry word say well
[2:03:38] you know i i'm a teacher a teacher is
[2:03:41] not somebody with a dry word until the
[2:03:44] word has got to be anointed or is dead
[2:03:47] otherwise your letter killeth instead it
[2:03:50] gives life
[2:03:51] amen what we preach has to be anointed
[2:03:54] i've heard ministers in the message big
[2:03:56] name preachers actually stand up and say
[2:03:59] uh you know i can i can preach without
[2:04:01] the anointing i say oh god
[2:04:03] don't never let me do
[2:04:08] that i don't ever want to get up and not
[2:04:11] have your anointing
[2:04:13] i need nothing to brag about
[2:04:16] that i can preach without god
[2:04:20] i gotta have it
[2:04:24] it gives power to the preacher
[2:04:27] glory don't stop there gives power to
[2:04:30] the singer
[2:04:32] isn't it wonderful to hear anointed
[2:04:34] singer
[2:04:35] not just something that makes some
[2:04:36] pretty noise but where you know the
[2:04:39] anointing it comes down it bathes over
[2:04:43] the soul it cleanses
[2:04:45] it preaches the sermon within itself
[2:04:48] it brings healing
[2:04:51] deliverance
[2:04:52] with anointed singing because he gives
[2:04:54] power to be a singer it's just power to
[2:04:57] speak in tongues
[2:05:00] uh-oh
[2:05:01] don't hang up on me
[2:05:03] because it also gives power to interpret
[2:05:06] tongues
[2:05:07] it's full of power for the holy ghost
[2:05:10] holy spirit is the power of god it was
[2:05:12] the power of god that turned me around
[2:05:14] it was the power of god that sanctified
[2:05:16] me now it's the power of god that filled
[2:05:18] me
[2:05:22] what does the holy ghost fart brother
[2:05:23] branham asked
[2:05:25] he preached the whole sermon about it
[2:05:28] he said the holy ghost came to give you
[2:05:29] power
[2:05:31] power in prayer
[2:05:33] you take a person that's lived a good
[2:05:34] life but they're always defeated a good
[2:05:36] person
[2:05:38] oh sure i love the lord brother branham
[2:05:39] but always defeated they never get a
[2:05:41] prayer answered you feel that little
[2:05:44] woman with the holy ghost one time watch
[2:05:47] what takes place when she goes before
[2:05:49] the throne of god she's not defeated she
[2:05:52] comes boldly to the throne of god
[2:05:54] believing she has a right because she is
[2:05:57] a daughter of god by birth
[2:06:00] hallelujah amen that's the first thing
[2:06:02] you do when you go to god is position
[2:06:04] yourself in the right position i'm not
[2:06:06] coming a beggar

[2:06:11] i'm one of your children god and i'm
[2:06:13] knocking on your door because i've got a
[2:06:15] need in my life
[2:06:20] that's the way you approach god

[2:06:38] resurrection

[2:06:46] jesus it was back there in the days of
[2:06:47] the apostles is right here now
[2:06:51] and it's just winding up the end of the
[2:06:52] gentiles a great move that's going on

[2:07:49] savior and the current can flow right
[2:07:52] from the theophany realm come on right
[2:07:55] from the holy jokes right into you and
[2:07:57] empower you
[2:07:59] hallelujah amen raise you up out of your
[2:08:02] confusion out of your doubts out of your
[2:08:04] unbelief
[2:08:05] make a real child of god out of you
[2:08:08] resurrection is a renewal
[2:08:11] it's resuming
[2:08:12] an activity or a state after an
[2:08:15] interruption
[2:08:17] now a renewal
[2:08:23] let's think about that for a minute
[2:08:26] you know sometimes
[2:08:29] an old eagle gets down blowed down from
[2:08:31] the heights
[2:08:34] sometimes things happen to you
[2:08:37] that literally knock the breath out of
[2:08:39] you
[2:08:41] i can say not in a million years never
[2:08:45] that i ever think i'd be standing here
[2:08:47] today a widower
[2:08:48] never wasn't my thinking
[2:08:52] i expected god all along i've seen him
[2:08:54] do it before
[2:08:57] i've seen him raise her up before
[2:09:00] i seen her that low before
[2:09:02] i've seen god come on the scene before
[2:09:08] but i felt like the old eagle
[2:09:11] brother branham saw
[2:09:12] sitting on a limb
[2:09:14] blown down by a storm
[2:09:17] and a little chipmunk of a devil
[2:09:19] screaming out blasphemies in the ears
[2:09:22] days of miracles are passed and god
[2:09:24] don't hear your prayers and all kinds of
[2:09:26] nonsense
[2:09:28] days of miracles have passed you know
[2:09:29] it's a bunch of holy rollers nothing to
[2:09:32] him it's just about to make believe
[2:09:33] speaking in tongues make believe chatter
[2:09:35] chatter chatter all this nonsense it's
[2:09:37] all just worked up you just getting them
[2:09:39] enthused you know no such a thing god
[2:09:41] don't keep his word christ ain't the
[2:09:43] same yesterday today and forever oh he's
[2:09:45] chattered in my ears
[2:09:48] you say brother tim you yeah he's
[2:09:50] tattered in my ears he got jesus here
[2:09:52] one day and god didn't try to get him to
[2:09:55] question if he's the son of god
[2:09:58] come on
[2:09:59] let me try to get him to question and
[2:10:00] prove whether he was and you know and
[2:10:03] and
[2:10:04] and you know you could look around and
[2:10:06] you say yeah god answers prayer but he
[2:10:08] didn't hear my prayers no more
[2:10:12] he makes you question did you fail god
[2:10:14] somewhere
[2:10:15] did you do something
[2:10:17] did you make a mistake did is there
[2:10:19] something you don't know
[2:10:22] hey he's tried to make me feel sorry for
[2:10:24] myself
[2:10:26] but i ain't having none of that
[2:10:29] because after a while i know the devil
[2:10:31] is going to be feeling sorry for himself
[2:10:36] amen he ain't seen nothing to what's
[2:10:38] coming
[2:10:39] he's made me feel alone and forsaken but
[2:10:42] that's impossible
[2:10:43] because jesus said i'll never leave you
[2:10:46] or forsake you

[2:10:50] the ministry that follows moses remember
