[11:00] we're already off to a rough start
[11:02] let's see if we can fix
[11:06] there we go
[11:07] hey man let's go to prayer
[11:11] Heavenly Father Lord once again we
[11:14] gathered
[11:15] on a Friday evening to look into your
[11:17] word Lord and just we asked that you
[11:20] would come now and that you would open
[11:21] it to us and that you would reveal it to
[11:23] us
[11:24] and Lord that it wouldn't just be a
[11:26] lesson but that Lord you would open it
[11:28] to our hearts or that you would reveal
[11:31] it Lord to these young people Lord that
[11:33] you would reveal it to each one of us in
[11:35] a deeper in a greater way father Lord
[11:37] that we can see the word for our day
[11:40] Lord the word for our hour Lord and we
[11:43] can be changed from glory to glory Lord
[11:45] as we read your word now I pray that
[11:47] you'll just take complete control and
[11:49] that you'll Speak Lord in the name of
[11:51] Jesus we pray amen amen
[11:56] and if you'll remain standing with me
[11:58] we're going to go ahead and and read our
[12:01] scripture which would correspond here
[12:04] with the the church age that we're
[12:06] studying the smyrnian age and
[12:09] I love this
[12:11] uh graphic that brother Michael found on
[12:14] online earlier and put it up to go along
[12:16] with our study and
[12:18] so we're going to read about the
[12:19] smyrnian age here and it is Revelation 2
[12:22] and it's verses 8 through 11. it says
[12:26] and unto the angel of the Church of
[12:29] Smyrna right these things saith the
[12:32] first and the last which was dead and is
[12:35] alive I Know Thy works and tribulations
[12:38] and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know
[12:42] the blasphemy of them which say they are
[12:45] Jews and are not but are the synagogue
[12:47] of Satan fear none of those things which
[12:51] Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall
[12:54] cast some of you into prison that ye may
[12:57] be tried and you shall have tribulation
[12:59] ten days be thou faithful unto death and
[13:02] I will give thee a Crown of Life he that
[13:05] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[13:08] saith unto the churches he that
[13:11] overcometh shall not be hurt of the
[13:15] second death amen I pray the Lord is
[13:18] Blessing as you have your seats this
[13:20] evening
[13:24] and what we're covering tonight we we've
[13:26] made it to we're going to be finishing
[13:29] up the second uh Church age which is the
[13:32] Smart age of smyrnia and we're on the
[13:35] second part of that and just a quick
[13:38] review as we kind of settle in and look
[13:40] at some of the things we spoke about
[13:42] last time
[13:44] um
[13:45] brother Branham said that using our
[13:47] god-given rule of choosing the messenger
[13:49] for each Age We unhesitatingly declare
[13:52] that irenius was exalted by the Lord to
[13:56] that position and and what he's talking
[13:58] about and we've talked about this each
[13:59] and every time is is a pattern that the
[14:02] Lord showed him and he said that the
[14:04] messenger would be the one who's whose
[14:07] Ministry closest resembled that of the
[14:10] first church age messenger Paul and so
[14:13] using that pattern he looks and he's led
[14:15] to the Holy Spirit and he declares that
[14:18] the messenger to this age was ireneous
[14:21] and and we learned and talked about that
[14:23] the age lasted from 170 A.D to 312 A.D
[14:29] and during this time it wasn't an easy
[14:31] time to be a Christian that the
[14:33] population of Smyrna was mostly against
[14:36] Christianity it was an age of great
[14:39] persecution and great bitterness and we
[14:42] learned that the word Smyrna means
[14:45] bitter and we ended last time talking
[14:49] about that the 10 years of tribulation
[14:52] that they suffered and how they were
[14:54] faithful unto death and that they
[14:57] received a crown of life whenever they
[15:00] uh for for staying faithful and we
[15:02] talked about how all of this persecution
[15:04] was actually done in the name of
[15:08] religion the the false Vine came in and
[15:11] began to get stronger and they began to
[15:13] claim that they were the true and they
[15:15] said that those of the True Vine were
[15:18] actually Heretics and Fanatics and that
[15:20] they must be purged out of the church
[15:23] thus leading to to Great persecution in
[15:26] prison and torture and and even death
[15:29] and as we finished up last time this was
[15:32] one of the last things that we read
[15:34] and this quote really stood out to me
[15:37] even in the days following our study
[15:38] because many of them did seal their
[15:41] testimony with their life but brother
[15:43] Branham says they died in the faith like
[15:45] Antipas the faithful martyr they held
[15:48] not their lives dear unto death often we
[15:52] think that it would be almost impossible
[15:54] to be a martyr but dare to recall that
[15:59] the faith we daily use to Triumph in
[16:02] Christ Jesus is the same faith that
[16:05] upholds the polycarps and the martyrs
[16:08] the Supreme faith will give Supreme
[16:11] Grace for the Supreme hour blessed be
[16:15] God forever so so young people the exact
[16:18] same faith that you use every single day
[16:21] is the exact same faith that they use to
[16:23] stand in the Coliseum that they use to
[16:26] hold their testimony When lines were
[16:28] released upon them or when Gladiators or
[16:30] or whatever was done to them is the
[16:32] exact same faith and what I want you to
[16:35] focus on is it will produce the exact
[16:37] same victory in your life as it produced
[16:41] in their life if that Faith was enough
[16:43] and that Grace was enough for the hour
[16:45] that they stood in that faith in that
[16:47] Grace will be perfect and enough for the
[16:50] hour that you stand in that that's what
[16:52] it's saying when it says the Supreme
[16:54] faith will give Supreme Grace for the
[16:57] Supreme hour in other words in the hour
[17:00] that you live whatever it is that you
[17:02] face in your hour of Temptation his
[17:05] grace is sufficient and your hour of
[17:07] sickness his grace is sufficient in your
[17:10] hour of trial and tribulation whatever
[17:12] it is you facing in 2023 the Supreme
[17:16] Grace for the Supreme hour will be there
[17:19] for you amen amen so
[17:22] we began reading this time at the reward
[17:26] for overcoming
[17:29] and so most of our Focus tonight will
[17:31] come out of Revelations 2 and 11 and it
[17:33] says he that hath an ear let him hear
[17:36] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[17:39] he that overcometh shall not be hurt of
[17:43] the second death now to establish right
[17:46] off the bat exactly what is the second
[17:49] death we're going to look at Revelations
[17:50] 20 and 14. so it says you're not going
[17:53] to be hurt of the second death he that
[17:55] overcometh how many hears Overcomers
[17:57] tonight so it says you're not going to
[18:00] be heard of the second death what is the
[18:02] second death and death and hell were
[18:05] cast into the Lake of Fire this is the
[18:09] second death
[18:10] all right so we established that right
[18:12] that is for for us if we want to
[18:14] simplify and talk about in terms of
[18:16] Heaven and Hell going to hell would be
[18:19] the second death okay but it's telling
[18:21] you right off the bat that you're not
[18:23] gonna be hurt of the second death what I
[18:26] want you to notice here in verse 11 is
[18:29] that once again he is speaking to all
[18:32] the ages
[18:33] okay because he says unto thee churches
[18:36] so he's not being specific to one church
[18:39] or one age this message goes unto all
[18:42] the ages he's speaking to all the ages
[18:45] here and he gives a message of comfort
[18:47] and he says to those that overcome the
[18:50] second death will not hurt them no
[18:54] brother Branham goes from this right
[18:56] here and he and right in this moment he
[18:58] begins to teach on no eternal hell he
[19:01] begins to teach on how that we don't
[19:03] believe that hell can be Eternal and he
[19:06] says right here very strongly he says
[19:09] but I stand here on the authority of the
[19:12] word of God and deny that the believer
[19:16] goes to it that the unbeliever excuse me
[19:18] that the unbeliever goes to an eternal
[19:20] hell and burns there eternally in the
[19:24] first place hell or the Lake of Fire or
[19:27] whatever you want to call it is not
[19:31] Eternal how can it be if it had a
[19:35] beginning
[19:36] now many times I think when we talk
[19:38] about eternity we think from now until
[19:42] time never stopping
[19:44] but eternity also means never had a
[19:47] beginning
[19:48] so if hell had a beginning if it was
[19:51] created it also must have an end all
[19:56] things that have a beginning also have
[19:59] an end so as we look into this no
[20:03] eternal hell I want to read Matthew 25
[20:04] and 41. it says then shall he say also
[20:09] unto them on the left he's talking about
[20:11] they've been divided under the left hand
[20:13] and unto the right hand some are going
[20:15] to go into eternal life but he says to
[20:17] them on the left hand depart from me ye
[20:20] cursed into Everlasting fire and what's
[20:24] the next word
[20:25] somebody it's okay y'all don't be scared
[20:27] tonight
[20:28] thank you prepared
[20:30] for the devil and his angels the key
[20:35] word here is prepared because if it was
[20:38] prepared then it wasn't without
[20:40] beginning
[20:43] Eternal is without beginning or end if
[20:45] it has a preparation or a beginning it
[20:49] must have an ending so so hell might
[20:52] last a really really really really
[20:54] really really long time it might be
[20:56] millions of years I don't know I don't
[20:58] plan on finding out
[21:00] and it might be long times but it is not
[21:04] Eternal it can't be it can't be Eternal
[21:07] because it was created and therefore it
[21:10] is a part of time
[21:13] if it was created as a part of time but
[21:16] one day time is going to end and only
[21:20] that which has eternal life can continue
[21:23] on
[21:24] think about it now only that which has
[21:28] eternal life can continue on so if it
[21:31] was created in time like hell when time
[21:34] ends hell must end also now a lot of
[21:38] people get hung up right here on the
[21:39] word
[21:41] Everlasting fire
[21:43] Everlasting that means that means
[21:45] Eternal no Everlasting does not mean
[21:47] that the word Everlasting means from the
[21:50] ages to the ages and in different places
[21:54] when it's used Everlasting has different
[21:56] meanings attached to it in other places
[21:58] it means to the vanishing point so it
[22:02] does not mean
[22:04] Eternal and brother Branham spends time
[22:06] on this
[22:07] um speaking about no eternal hell
[22:10] so let's talk about
[22:13] eternal for just a second
[22:15] Eternal brother Brown says when it
[22:17] applies to God it means to be without
[22:21] beginning or end
[22:23] and ever enduring and never
[22:28] ceasing
[22:29] so look at first John 5 and 11 it says
[22:31] and this is the record that God hath
[22:34] given to us
[22:36] eternal life and this life is in his son
[22:41] now we're laying this down pretty heavy
[22:44] because it serves both purposes not only
[22:46] to show that there is no eternal hell
[22:48] but also we want to also get rid of the
[22:51] idea of well if things that are created
[22:54] must come to an end what about me I had
[22:56] a beginning I had a creation we want to
[22:58] do away with that because we're going to
[23:00] find that you possess Eternal qualities
[23:02] that there are qualities about you
[23:04] placed in you that God placed there that
[23:07] are Eternal and we have to get out of
[23:10] this mind frame of why I was born in
[23:12] 1980 or whatever year you were born yes
[23:15] that's when this flesh became manifested
[23:17] here on the Earth but that's not my
[23:18] beginning because I did not have a
[23:21] beginning amen he says this is the
[23:24] record that God hath given to us
[23:26] eternal life and this life is in his son
[23:32] so only sons of God
[23:36] can have
[23:38] eternal life
[23:40] only sons of God can have eternal life
[23:42] brother Brandon says now if a sinner is
[23:45] going to go to hell
[23:47] and then suffer the same as you are
[23:50] going to heaven and enjoy heaven then he
[23:53] has to have the same kind of life you
[23:55] have
[23:56] in other words he says Eternal he's
[23:59] getting down to it he says eternal life
[24:01] isn't a matter of geographic location
[24:04] it isn't you get eternal life but you
[24:07] get rewards and you're happy and you get
[24:09] eternal life but you're in fire burning
[24:12] the the entire time because in order to
[24:15] burn
[24:16] eternally you would have to have
[24:19] eternal life
[24:21] and so brother Branham is making this
[24:23] very clear that the sinner can't have
[24:26] eternal life because the only place to
[24:28] get eternal life is in the Sun the only
[24:31] place to get it is through Jesus Through
[24:33] the blood that was shed for for his
[24:35] children Sinners do not have that
[24:39] eternal life brother Branham says
[24:41] eternal life is God
[24:44] the Lord Jesus Christ
[24:47] and I want to tell you tonight the only
[24:49] way you're going to make it there is
[24:51] with that life the only way you're going
[24:53] to live eternally is to completely
[24:55] surrender your life to the Lord Jesus
[24:58] this life is in his son you won't find
[25:03] eternal life in your own well-doing you
[25:04] won't find eternal life in your works
[25:06] you won't find eternal life anywhere but
[25:09] in surrendering your heart to the Lord
[25:10] Jesus and saying Lord take all of me
[25:13] take all of me because that's the only
[25:15] way you're going to live eternally and
[25:17] the only place anyone will ever live
[25:19] eternally is in heaven no one will live
[25:22] eternally in Hell amen that's what he's
[25:25] saying the redeemed don't have to fear
[25:29] hell they don't have to fear the second
[25:31] death because they are Overcomers the
[25:34] second death will never hurt
[25:37] the Overcomers he says
[25:40] and they will never come into
[25:42] condemnation he's talking about you they
[25:45] will never be in that Lake of Fire they
[25:48] would they they can never be lost for he
[25:51] will lose none of them not one of the
[25:54] redeemed will be anywhere except where
[25:58] Jesus is hallelujah I'm not going to be
[26:01] anywhere except where Jesus is and I
[26:04] love because he begins to break it down
[26:06] and who it is that came and died for you
[26:09] who was it that came and shed his blood
[26:11] for you he was Jehovah he was the
[26:13] creator he was God Almighty and he says
[26:16] oh how striking it is
[26:19] now think about it
[26:21] a lot of you have watched the the
[26:23] episodes of The Chosen and and you love
[26:26] the the humanity part that you see and
[26:29] how relatable that they make Jesus and
[26:32] I've actually enjoyed that because
[26:33] brother Branham does the exact same
[26:35] thing he says how striking it is Jehovah
[26:39] born crying over a manure pile
[26:43] Jehovah born in a manger of straw
[26:49] it was Jehovah that came and paid the
[26:51] price for your sins it was the the
[26:53] Creator that came and said they will
[26:56] never taste of the second death they
[26:58] will never go down into hell whether
[27:00] it's one year five years ten years or a
[27:02] million years I don't care what it is
[27:04] Jehovah came Jehovah died for you
[27:07] Jehovah shed his blood for you it was
[27:10] the blood of almighty God that came to
[27:13] make sure my children will never taste
[27:16] of the second death my children will
[27:18] never go down into hell I'm gonna go
[27:21] down and I'm going to pay the price for
[27:23] them to make sure you would never
[27:25] experience the torment of Hell to make
[27:29] sure that you could be healed to make
[27:31] sure that you could be delivered tonight
[27:33] from whatever it is that's coming
[27:34] against you to make sure that you could
[27:36] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:39] Jehovah did that almighty God did that
[27:42] and he came down and he took on flesh to
[27:45] do that
[27:46] for you
[27:48] he says then we think we have a right to
[27:50] be proud
[27:52] holding up our noses criticizing and
[27:56] acting as though we were somebody
[27:59] think about it no matter how well you
[28:01] were raised no matter how well you have
[28:03] it no matter how well you've
[28:04] accomplished the most accomplished the
[28:06] most Almighty the most awesome the most
[28:08] wonderful the most Sublime being that
[28:10] ever was
[28:12] lowered himself and humbled himself and
[28:15] came and was born over a manure power
[28:19] he says here's your real sign this is
[28:22] the right one
[28:23] Jehovah playing as a boy
[28:26] Jehovah working in a carpenter shop
[28:29] Jehovah washing the feet of fishermen
[28:34] Jehovah standing in the courtyard
[28:36] bruised and bleeding with thorns on his
[28:39] brow spit on his face mocked and said it
[28:43] not Jehovah
[28:45] despised and rejected hanged naked upon
[28:49] a cross while the Hypocrites jeered and
[28:53] dared him to come down off the cross
[28:55] Jehovah dying if this doesn't do
[28:58] something to you something's wrong with
[29:00] you
[29:01] Jehovah dying Jehovah
[29:04] praying nothing happening
[29:07] then Jehovah died
[29:09] that is the sign for all men now that is
[29:13] the sign who did it who did it for you I
[29:17] didn't God did it for you God himself
[29:20] came and did it he humbled himself for
[29:23] you
[29:24] he humbled himself that you can be saved
[29:28] and we want to lick it up our nose and
[29:30] act like we're something or somebody how
[29:33] about we humble ourselves and be patient
[29:34] with others how about we humble
[29:36] ourselves and have Grace for others
[29:39] how about we lay down ourselves and and
[29:41] step aside from who we think we are and
[29:44] how good we are and realize we got to
[29:46] have Grace for others who may be
[29:47] struggling listen he left heaven for
[29:49] your struggles he left Heaven because he
[29:52] knew you couldn't do it and he came down
[29:54] and took on flesh and he went through
[29:56] all of that
[29:57] for you
[29:59] but I've got good news for you he didn't
[30:01] stay dead
[30:03] he didn't stay in a tomb but he wanted
[30:05] more for you than just than just the
[30:07] price to be paid he wanted to make it to
[30:09] where you could live an overcoming life
[30:11] he wanted to make it to where the very
[30:13] spirit that lived on the inside of him
[30:15] could come back and live on the inside
[30:17] of you they put him in a tomb but he
[30:20] didn't stay there but he rose back up
[30:22] and what was the point of the
[30:23] Resurrection the point of the
[30:25] Resurrection to show I have conquered
[30:27] death and hell and the grave and then he
[30:30] ascended what was the point of that that
[30:31] he could send back his holy spirit to
[30:34] live in your life that you could have
[30:37] eternal life
[30:39] brother Branham says Jehovah came forth
[30:41] Jehovah ascended on high then Jehovah
[30:45] returned to indwell his church Jehovah
[30:48] came back with a mighty rushing wind and
[30:50] flames of fire Jehovah came back to walk
[30:53] in the midst of his church and Empower
[30:55] his people once more Jehovah came and
[30:59] this time to stay in his people
[31:02] and again Jehovah heals the sick raises
[31:06] the dead manifest himself by the spirit
[31:08] Jehovah came back speaking in tongues
[31:11] and giving the answer back in
[31:13] interpretation
[31:15] Jehovah came back and he gave you
[31:18] himself that you could overcome sin that
[31:20] you could overcome the world that you
[31:22] could overcome the devil he gave you the
[31:25] holy ghost that God again could be
[31:28] manifested in the flesh in his body on
[31:32] the earth and call it his bride
[31:35] think about it he was manifested in the
[31:37] flesh once in Jesus
[31:39] but he wanted to be manifested in the
[31:41] flesh The Same Spirit once again
[31:43] manifested to where people could see it
[31:45] touch it
[31:47] and how's he going to do it once again
[31:49] in a body called The Bride
[31:56] he says yes Jehovah came to manifest In
[31:59] the Flesh and manifest through flesh
[32:01] Jehovah came God in us the the hope of
[32:04] glory yes Jesus came and shed his blood
[32:07] and set the captive free he came and
[32:10] redeemed his lost sheep he gave them
[32:12] eternal life and they shall never perish
[32:15] he won't lose one of them but raised
[32:18] them up at the last day Hallelujah the
[32:21] second death cannot hurt them it has no
[32:25] power
[32:26] over them hell is the second death it
[32:31] will have an end but you will not it
[32:34] will hurt many but it will never hurt
[32:37] you why is that because we are a part of
[32:40] him hopefully we can drive that home
[32:42] tonight that we are a part of him and
[32:45] because of that you will live eternally
[32:47] the only thing that is eternal is God
[32:50] and so in order to live eternally you
[32:52] must be a part of God
[32:55] those cast into the Lake of Fire are not
[32:58] a part of him so how could they ever
[33:00] live eternally how could they live
[33:02] eternally even in punishment even if it
[33:05] was for the sake of punishment for
[33:07] rejecting what the Lord did for them
[33:09] they would still have to have eternal
[33:11] life on the inside they would have to
[33:14] have the very life of God on the inside
[33:16] and brother Branham makes it very clear
[33:18] that is not possible but regardless
[33:23] of how long hell is or how long hell
[33:26] isn't I'm just glad that the second dead
[33:28] hath no power over me and that the
[33:31] second death have no power over you
[33:33] because we've been bought with the very
[33:35] blood of God the very blood of god
[33:38] Jehovah the Creator came and took on
[33:41] flesh and shed that blood for you so
[33:43] that when time stops you're going to
[33:46] keep right on going when time stops
[33:48] you're going to March right on into
[33:50] eternity and be living forevermore not
[33:52] in torture not in torment but in the
[33:54] glories that he has prepared for you
[33:57] amen amen
[34:00] the Holy Spirit
[34:02] in every age
[34:04] once again it says he that hath an ear
[34:06] let him hear what the spirit
[34:10] saith unto the churches there is not one
[34:14] Church age
[34:16] where this verse isn't mentioned
[34:19] every time it's mentioned he that hath
[34:21] an ear let him hear what the spirit says
[34:25] to the churches now it's obvious that
[34:28] he's not talking about literal ears
[34:30] okay it's not he's not talking about
[34:34] literally hearing the way that you're
[34:36] hearing me tonight
[34:38] that's not what he what he's talking
[34:40] about because we all have ears and
[34:42] physically we can all hear
[34:44] so what is it that he's saying here what
[34:47] is it that he's speaking of when he says
[34:49] he that hath an ear
[34:52] let him hear I want to go through
[34:54] some different scriptures here to
[34:56] highlight our point and to make this
[34:58] very clear to all of us what it means to
[35:00] hear and what he's talking about Matthew
[35:02] 13 13. therefore speak out to them in
[35:07] parables
[35:08] because they seeing see not and hearing
[35:13] they hear not neither do they understand
[35:17] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[35:19] isaiahs which saith by hearing you shall
[35:22] hear and shall not understand and seeing
[35:25] you shall see and shall not perceive for
[35:28] this people's heart is wax gross and
[35:30] their ears are dull of hearing in their
[35:32] eyes they have closed lest at any time
[35:35] they should see with their eyes and hear
[35:37] with their ears and should understand
[35:40] with their heart and should be converted
[35:43] and I shall should heal them but blessed
[35:46] are your eyes for they see and your ears
[35:50] for they hear he says they hear me
[35:52] but they don't hear me
[35:55] they see me but they're not seeing me
[35:59] so once again it's obvious that we're
[36:01] not talking about just naturally but
[36:02] then he comes back and he says but you
[36:04] hear
[36:05] no he's not talking about this he's
[36:07] talking about the other kind of hearing
[36:10] you're understanding what the spirit is
[36:13] saying
[36:15] John 8 42 Jesus said unto them if God
[36:18] were your father you would love me for I
[36:20] am proceeded forth and came from God
[36:23] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[36:25] why do you not understand my speech
[36:29] even because you cannot hear my word
[36:34] ye are of your father the devil and the
[36:37] lust of your father you will do he was a
[36:39] murderer from the beginning and Abode
[36:41] not in the truth because there is no
[36:43] truth in him when he speaketh Allah he
[36:46] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[36:48] the father of it notice
[36:50] why do you not understand my speech
[36:52] because you cannot hear
[36:55] my words it's in these scriptures that
[36:58] it becomes clear that no man within his
[37:01] own power
[37:02] can hear God
[37:05] no man within himself no matter how hard
[37:07] he tries can hear God it is an ability
[37:11] given by God
[37:14] we found this in Matthew 16 17 and Jesus
[37:16] answered and said unto him blessed art
[37:18] thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood
[37:21] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[37:22] Father which is in heaven
[37:25] why was Simon barjona able to understand
[37:28] because he tried real hard
[37:30] because he thought about it real long
[37:31] and hard
[37:32] no but because his father in Heaven hath
[37:35] revealed it to him so it is God that
[37:38] gives the revelation of what the spirit
[37:40] is saying in each age he that hath an
[37:44] ear he who hath understanding he who the
[37:47] spirit has been that God has revealed it
[37:50] to him
[37:51] and you sit there and say well well this
[37:53] is hard then then who can
[37:55] who can understand who can hear
[37:58] who is it that God is giving this
[38:01] spiritual Revelation to
[38:05] ears to hear Brother Branham says it is
[38:08] one special group that receives the
[38:13] Revelation for each age one listen I
[38:16] want you to understand something tonight
[38:18] you're special
[38:19] you are a special group it is one
[38:22] special group that receives the
[38:24] Revelation for each age that group is of
[38:27] God because the group that cannot hear
[38:30] is not of God we just read that
[38:31] scripture he says you're of your father
[38:33] the devil because you can't understand
[38:34] and hear what I'm saying
[38:36] the group that can and does hear what
[38:39] the spirit is saying and receives the
[38:41] Revelation thereof is that group
[38:43] described in First Corinthians 2 6-16
[38:46] they are the ones who have the spirit of
[38:49] God they are the ones that are born of
[38:51] God they are baptized into the body of
[38:54] the Lord Jesus Christ by his Spirit they
[38:57] are baptized with the Holy Ghost
[39:01] listen before we go any further we ought
[39:03] to thank God that we have ears to hear
[39:05] we ought to thank God today that we are
[39:07] part of the group that has been chosen
[39:09] and called and elected to receive this
[39:12] message and not just have it cross our
[39:13] path but not only just have it just hear
[39:16] it but really be able to hear it really
[39:18] be able to recognize who we are and
[39:20] where we are and whose we are and where
[39:22] we're standing because you have ears to
[39:25] hear listen there are many that hear it
[39:28] with these ears
[39:29] there are many that hear it but it's
[39:31] never refilled to them they just can't
[39:34] see it they just can't understand it
[39:37] they just can't accept it but you can
[39:40] you can receive it you can accept it
[39:43] because you have ears to hear tonight
[39:46] Hallelujah but what does that think
[39:49] about what that says about who you are
[39:52] think about what that says about whose
[39:54] you are tonight
[39:55] not not just hear and say well I accept
[39:59] it that that's good
[40:01] but someone who truly hears it
[40:04] and how do you know if someone truly
[40:06] hears it because they will take it and
[40:08] they will allow it to begin affecting
[40:10] their lives you will see them living by
[40:12] living according to it and you will see
[40:15] their life begin to change because of it
[40:17] they have heard
[40:21] brother Branham says and to every age we
[40:24] hear the same truth it says he that hath
[40:27] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[40:29] saith to the churches but only a
[40:33] Spirit-filled man can hear the
[40:36] Revelation for that age why do you think
[40:39] you hear it said over and over and over
[40:41] again that it's got to be more than a
[40:43] head knowledge
[40:44] because if it's only a head knowledge or
[40:47] it's only that something that's been
[40:49] learned then you're only hearing it with
[40:52] these ears
[40:53] that's what a head knowledge is you've
[40:55] heard it
[40:56] you see it well that makes sense okay
[40:58] that makes sense and you you can stack
[41:00] this with this and point it you're just
[41:02] hearing it
[41:03] but when you were born again with the
[41:05] Holy Spirit and he can actually reveal
[41:08] it to your soul to where it becomes
[41:11] deeper and more and anchored down than
[41:13] that from up here and it drops down to
[41:16] here brother Branham says only a
[41:19] Spirit-filled man can hear the
[41:21] Revelation for that age that's why you
[41:23] can sit there for years and years and
[41:25] years and I've I was there in that place
[41:27] in rebellion and not understanding this
[41:29] and not understanding that and why do we
[41:31] have to do this and why do we have to do
[41:33] this and why this and why that and then
[41:35] get filled with the Holy Ghost and all
[41:37] your wives go away
[41:39] all the things that used to hang me up
[41:41] why can't I do this and why isn't this
[41:43] wrong all of a sudden those questions
[41:44] don't matter anymore it doesn't even
[41:46] matter if I can answer those questions
[41:48] those questions are gone
[41:51] because the Revelation that this is the
[41:53] truth can now be struck down on the
[41:55] inside of my heart and even if I don't
[41:57] understand something I can say Lord I
[41:59] know it's the truth now you can lead me
[42:01] and guide me and let me hear exactly
[42:04] what it is you're trying to say there's
[42:07] a huge difference between someone who
[42:09] just knows about it and somebody whose
[42:12] ears have been opened by the baptism of
[42:14] the Holy Ghost amen
[42:20] brother Branham says now when God is
[42:22] silent we had better be silent but where
[42:24] he has spoken we had better speak to
[42:27] and say what he has already said he told
[42:30] us the evidence now I want to listen
[42:33] y'all to listen close as we get into
[42:34] some things here
[42:36] the evidence or what would happen after
[42:39] being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[42:43] was that we would have an inside
[42:46] have the teacher come and teach all
[42:49] truth but that teacher was an inside
[42:51] teacher you wouldn't hear the truth and
[42:55] receive it by Revelation if you heard it
[42:58] every moment of the day that was the
[43:02] sign of the indwelling spirit in the
[43:04] days of Paul those who were filled with
[43:06] the Holy Ghost heard the word received
[43:09] it and lived it I want to read that
[43:12] again because I missed a part so the
[43:14] teacher was an inside teacher not an
[43:16] outside teacher if the spirit wasn't
[43:19] inside you you wouldn't hear the truth
[43:22] and receive it by Revelation in other
[43:24] words you can't receive all the truth if
[43:26] the spirit isn't on the inside of you
[43:29] and so this is how you have to measure
[43:31] your experience
[43:33] we're going to go into this for a minute
[43:35] because there's different ways and and
[43:37] you you hear it preached here all the
[43:38] time the Dynamics and the Dynamics and
[43:41] we believe that absolutely but brother
[43:43] Brown I'm saying here that those who are
[43:45] filled with the Holy Ghost Hear the word
[43:47] receive the word and live it
[43:51] so how do we measure or how do we uh
[43:53] what is the Plumb line for our
[43:56] experience
[43:57] well brother Aaron I ran and I shouted
[44:00] and I felt the Holy Ghost when it fell
[44:01] on me brother Aaron I spoke in tongues
[44:04] and it was a supernatural event
[44:06] I felt a shiver come over me as I began
[44:08] speaking in tongues
[44:10] that's not it the sign of the indwelling
[44:14] is they heard it they received it and
[44:17] they lived it
[44:21] he says in every age and I love this
[44:23] part he adds in and every age is the age
[44:26] of the Holy Ghost for a True Believer
[44:28] I say in every age the evidence was the
[44:32] same
[44:33] those who had the spirit the teacher
[44:36] heard the word
[44:38] and that spirit in them took the word
[44:40] and told it to them the spirit inside of
[44:45] them takes what they hear on Sunday
[44:47] takes what they hear on Wednesday takes
[44:49] what they read in their own bedroom it
[44:52] takes it and teaches it to them
[44:55] it is an inside teacher
[44:58] it teaches it to them and they were of
[45:02] the group that heard the messenger
[45:05] and his message and took it and lived it
[45:10] the key here is and lived it not just
[45:15] the parks they liked
[45:18] not just the doctrines they like
[45:21] but all of it that includes the Dynamics
[45:24] that includes the movement of the spirit
[45:27] that includes deliverances and healings
[45:29] and tongues and prayer lines but it also
[45:31] includes the doctrines the standards
[45:34] the sacrifices that come along with it
[45:36] it includes all of that all of that the
[45:39] people who are truly filled with the
[45:41] Holy Ghost will want to see all of that
[45:44] they will hear it They will receive it
[45:46] and they will live it and they won't try
[45:48] to explain it away
[45:52] because they can truly hear what the
[45:55] spirit is saying to each age
[45:59] let's deal for a moment here because
[46:02] this isn't really understood even today
[46:04] amongst many
[46:07] to receive the Holy Spirit what does
[46:10] this mean
[46:13] now the Pentecostals believed and
[46:16] brother Branham talks about this that
[46:18] people receive the Holy Spirit after
[46:20] being born again
[46:23] and that it would manifest in the
[46:25] speaking of tongues and he talked about
[46:26] how
[46:27] when he would call for those filled with
[46:29] the spirit to come down and pray for
[46:31] those at the altar those you know that
[46:34] needed the the Holy Spirit he said they
[46:37] would come down and he says and I'm you
[46:40] know wanting them to be born again he
[46:43] says the Pentecostals would come down
[46:44] thinking they were already born again
[46:46] but needed the Holy Spirit
[46:48] so they began praying with them that
[46:49] they would speak in tongues or some
[46:51] other manifestation of the holy spirit
[46:53] because they were born again but now
[46:54] they needed to have the Holy Spirit come
[46:56] upon them
[46:57] okay and this this isn't wrong I mean
[47:00] this isn't right excuse me this is wrong
[47:02] this is wrong
[47:05] all right but to be born again
[47:08] and to be Spirit-filled
[47:11] are the same thing
[47:14] you can't separate those two
[47:18] and this is what causes a lot of issues
[47:20] and and misunderstanding things even
[47:22] when it comes to adoption what is the
[47:25] new birth what is the Holy Spirit
[47:27] what is to be born again is to receive
[47:31] the Holy Ghost before the baptism of the
[47:34] Holy Ghost you are not born again
[47:37] brother Branham teaches that clearly
[47:39] it's more than just believing and
[47:42] confessing I'm talking about being born
[47:44] again it's more than just believing and
[47:46] confessing although you must do that you
[47:49] must do that that's an important step
[47:51] you must believe you must confess you
[47:54] must be baptized those things are all
[47:56] important steps but you don't receive
[47:58] the Holy Ghost just by Believing on the
[48:00] Lord
[48:02] that's not how it works here's a quote
[48:04] brother Branham says you receive him
[48:07] since you believed Acts 19 2 and 6 he
[48:12] said unto them have you received the
[48:13] Holy Ghost since you believed so yes you
[48:18] do receive the Holy Ghost after you
[48:20] believe my point is when you believe
[48:22] that's not being born again
[48:26] you believe and then you receive the
[48:29] holy ghost or the new birth or you are
[48:31] born again
[48:32] okay it is something that comes later
[48:34] but it's not you're born again and then
[48:36] you receive the new birth because that
[48:38] don't even make sense born again and
[48:40] then receive the Holy Spirit
[48:42] the Holy Spirit the New Birth the Holy
[48:45] Ghost
[48:46] that's all the same thing
[48:48] okay
[48:50] brother Brown says I mean for The Sinner
[48:52] to come forward and be born again read
[48:55] it carefully
[48:56] which is to be baptized in the body of
[48:59] Christ by the Holy Ghost which is
[49:02] exactly what took place at Pentecost
[49:04] when the church was launched in other
[49:07] words to be born of the spirit is to be
[49:10] truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is
[49:13] one and the same
[49:17] so what he says here is that's exactly
[49:19] what took place at Pentecost so what
[49:21] he's saying is
[49:23] the hundred and twenty were not born
[49:25] again
[49:25] until the day of Pentecost
[49:28] that's when they truly received eternal
[49:31] life
[49:32] think about what he had said to Peter
[49:34] when you're converted
[49:37] you jump on a guy that's giving up
[49:38] everything and following you don't
[49:40] understand I've given up everything and
[49:41] I follow Jesus okay but you need to be
[49:43] converted
[49:45] you need the Holy Ghost you need to be
[49:48] born again
[49:53] brother Branham says now here is my
[49:55] point
[49:56] and listen close too many of our
[49:58] modernists and even our fundamentalists
[50:01] so-called believe unto salvation at a
[50:05] certain specific time which in many
[50:07] cases is called making a decision and
[50:10] that has been called receiving Christ or
[50:13] being born again now to receive Christ
[50:16] is to receive his Spirit to receive his
[50:20] spirit is to be born again to receive
[50:23] his spirit is to be baptized with the
[50:25] Holy Ghost amen these folks believe
[50:29] that's wonderful but they stop there
[50:32] they're not born again
[50:35] they've stopped there yes they still
[50:37] need the Holy Ghost to come after they
[50:39] believe that's because they need the new
[50:41] birth
[50:42] all they've done so far is believed unto
[50:46] salvation
[50:48] he says but they stop there
[50:51] you receive the Holy Ghost after you
[50:54] believe it has always been that way and
[50:57] it always will be amen
[51:01] he says here
[51:04] Pentecost was the pattern
[51:08] of New Birth
[51:10] he says it is the spirit that gives life
[51:13] in power and that came at Pentecost
[51:17] he says these directions came as a
[51:19] direct answer from Peter relative to
[51:22] what had actually happened at Pentecost
[51:24] what came to pass was that God according
[51:28] to Joel was pouring out the promised
[51:31] Holy Spirit upon All Flesh he was not
[51:34] poured out before that time or given
[51:37] before that time
[51:39] he was not poured out before Pentecost
[51:41] he was not given before Pentecost this
[51:45] was it but this was to come from now on
[51:49] by repenting and being baptized in the
[51:52] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then
[51:54] God was Duty bound to fill the ones who
[51:57] came Peter or any of the Apostles never
[52:00] said you must be born again and then
[52:03] filled with the spirit
[52:06] that's not how it works but I love what
[52:08] he said from that point on he's Duty
[52:11] bound young people if you need the Holy
[52:13] Ghost he's Duty bound that if you'll
[52:15] follow the same prescription if you'll
[52:17] repent and be baptized in the name of
[52:19] the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive
[52:21] the gift of the Holy Ghost if you've
[52:23] done those things and it hasn't come to
[52:25] pass there's something wrong with your
[52:27] repentance
[52:29] because if you were baptized in the name
[52:30] of Lord Jesus Christ and you haven't
[52:32] gotten filled with the spirit yet the
[52:34] only place there can be a problem is in
[52:36] the repent part
[52:37] there is something wrong with your
[52:39] repentance you're holding on to
[52:41] something you're not giving up something
[52:43] that's the only place where there can be
[52:45] a problem is in the repentance because
[52:48] he says he's obligated to still give it
[52:50] to you exactly the way he gave it to
[52:52] them then the new birth is the Holy
[52:56] Ghost before that like I said you're
[53:00] only believing unto salvation
[53:05] let's move on here
[53:08] now this first quote is something
[53:10] we're still dealing with the same thing
[53:12] it's an interesting quote I'm gonna read
[53:15] it and then we'll go into it what is it
[53:17] that caused this misunderstanding he's
[53:20] talking about people thinking they're
[53:22] born again and needing the holy ghost or
[53:24] what is the new birth and this and this
[53:26] is a very interesting quote and it gets
[53:27] thrown around a lot when it comes to the
[53:29] moving of the spirit and the
[53:30] Supernatural and and what kind of
[53:32] experience we're supposed to have what
[53:35] is it that calls this misunderstanding
[53:37] the answer is experience
[53:41] we have gone by experience and not the
[53:44] word
[53:45] away with experience and they'll stop
[53:48] there
[53:50] but read it away with experience as your
[53:54] measuring line
[53:56] there is only one Plumb line only one
[54:00] rod and that is the word the key here is
[54:05] as your measuring line away with
[54:10] experience as your
[54:13] measuring line
[54:15] and like I said people will use this
[54:17] quote many times to explain away the
[54:19] experience of the new birth but let's
[54:22] use it properly
[54:23] let's place it in its proper place in
[54:25] other words you can jump and you can
[54:27] shout you can speak in tongues you can
[54:30] see the pillar of fire you can be slain
[54:32] in the spirit but that isn't how you
[54:35] know you got it
[54:37] he's saying take that experience and use
[54:41] the word as your measuring line because
[54:43] there's lots of people who have spoken
[54:45] tongues who have danced who have shouted
[54:47] who have ran who've had experiences and
[54:51] I would never take that from them but
[54:52] then their life doesn't live up to the
[54:54] word
[54:55] and if they're basing it off experience
[54:57] well yes I got it look what happened
[54:59] look at my experience and we'll say but
[55:02] what about your life
[55:06] what about measuring it up to the word
[55:08] that's the Plumb line is there a
[55:10] standard of Holiness are the fruits of
[55:12] the spirit there are you living in
[55:14] overcoming life that's how you know you
[55:16] got it
[55:17] but it's not to do away with the
[55:19] experience is to do away with the
[55:22] experience as your measuring stick
[55:27] because so many would live like the
[55:29] world and then point to a tongue that's
[55:31] what brother Brandon was dealing with
[55:32] well I've got the Holy Ghost I spoke in
[55:34] tongues but living like the devil
[55:37] and he was saying quit pointing to the
[55:39] experience point to the word look into
[55:42] the mirror of the word and does it match
[55:44] up is your life matching what the word
[55:46] says and that's what this quote is for
[55:49] use the word
[55:52] this very next quote
[55:55] is in the exact same paragraph I didn't
[55:58] even change paragraphs
[56:00] he says the people believe and then stop
[56:02] you don't receive the Holy Ghost when
[56:04] you believe unto him having repented you
[56:07] go on and receive the Holy Ghost do you
[56:09] see it that is what's wrong with our
[56:12] fundamentalist they have no power for
[56:15] they stop short of Pentecost
[56:17] so you can't say he's against experience
[56:19] when in the very next sentence he's
[56:21] saying you've got to go to Pentecost
[56:23] you've got to have what they had at
[56:25] Pentecost you can't stop short of the
[56:28] Pentecostal experience
[56:30] but you better compare it to the word
[56:32] you better use the word as your
[56:34] measuring stick
[56:35] and I want it known that's what we
[56:37] believe at evening like Tabernacle we
[56:39] believe that yes the word is the Plumb
[56:42] line the word is our measuring stick
[56:45] that is the word but the word tells me
[56:48] what happened at Pentecost the word
[56:51] shows me what happened when Moses met
[56:53] the burning bush the word tells me that
[56:56] there were the signs that I do shall you
[56:58] do also that is the word so that is the
[57:01] measuring stick
[57:02] take the same quote and apply it to your
[57:04] church
[57:05] because according to the word all these
[57:08] gifts and Supernatural things should be
[57:09] operating in every local body
[57:12] use the word
[57:15] because the very same thing that people
[57:17] use to say word word word to douse on
[57:20] the supernatural actually confirms that
[57:22] the supernatural must be present that we
[57:25] must have experience we must have the
[57:27] moving of the spirit we must have
[57:29] healings and we must have gifts and we
[57:31] must have going we must have the power
[57:34] or the authority to lay hands on the
[57:36] sick and they shall recover that is the
[57:38] word that is our Plumb line and that's
[57:40] what we measure everything by is the
[57:44] word amen
[57:46] so I believe the same thing don't stop
[57:50] short until you have had the experience
[57:53] of the new birth and then let the word
[57:56] be your measuring then let the word be
[57:59] your Plumb line as brother Branham would
[58:01] say there
[58:05] God's choosing
[58:10] a lot of this part was very encouraged
[58:11] to me encouraging to me
[58:14] sometimes we wonder why why are are we
[58:17] his why me
[58:19] why am I his why why do I hear what the
[58:23] spirit is saying when there's so many
[58:24] others out there why is it that they
[58:27] can't hear why why do I have eternal
[58:29] life and not this one what makes me so
[58:31] special
[58:32] and we have to realize that just as a
[58:34] man chooses
[58:36] his bride in the natural
[58:38] so does God choose his bride
[58:41] it's God that does the choosing and
[58:42] here's a few scriptures that would
[58:44] illustrate that
[58:46] John 6 37 all that the father giveth me
[58:50] shall come to me so it's his choosing he
[58:54] has chosen the ones that he's given it
[58:56] didn't say all will come to me
[58:59] it's the ones that the father hath given
[59:01] me
[59:02] verse 44 no man can come to me except
[59:05] the Father which hath sent me draw him
[59:09] it's him doing the choosing it's him
[59:11] doing the calling it's him doing the
[59:13] drawing
[59:14] Ephesians 1 and 4 according as he had
[59:17] chosen us wait wait but no I chose God I
[59:20] went down to the Altar and he had chosen
[59:23] us he chose you
[59:26] according as he had chosen Us in him now
[59:30] this is the key and we're going to be
[59:31] getting in on this a lot here as we go
[59:34] forward in him is a key phrase
[59:36] in him
[59:39] before the foundation of the world so
[59:41] where were you before the foundation of
[59:43] the world
[59:44] in him
[59:47] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[59:50] before him in love having predestinated
[59:54] us unto the adoption of children
[59:57] how can you not come to the full
[59:59] adoption when you were already
[1:00:00] predestinated to do it
[1:00:02] by Jesus Christ to himself according to
[1:00:06] the good pleasure of his will why did he
[1:00:09] choose you because he wanted to
[1:00:12] it was the good pleasure of his will it
[1:00:15] gave him good pleasure to do it brother
[1:00:18] Brown says Jesus Christ is choosing his
[1:00:20] own bride just the same as men choose
[1:00:23] their bride
[1:00:24] today
[1:00:27] and I don't know about you but this
[1:00:28] really excites me because if it was me
[1:00:30] doing the choose and I could fail
[1:00:32] if it was me that was doing all this I
[1:00:34] could mess up but if he chose me then he
[1:00:36] can't unchoose me if he called your name
[1:00:39] he didn't call your name to let you go
[1:00:41] if he loved me then he loves me today if
[1:00:44] he said I was going to make it he's not
[1:00:45] going to let me fail because it was him
[1:00:48] that chose me if he said I was part of
[1:00:50] his bride there's no backing up there's
[1:00:52] no backing up there's nothing can mess
[1:00:54] that up now we may have troubles and
[1:00:56] tribulations and things that stumble us
[1:00:58] along the way but if he loved you and he
[1:01:00] called you and he chose you you're gonna
[1:01:01] be there he can't unchoose you he can't
[1:01:04] change your mind it don't matter it
[1:01:05] can't change his mind it don't matter
[1:01:06] what the devil says to you it don't
[1:01:08] matter what angle it comes from God
[1:01:10] loves you as we heard Wednesday night he
[1:01:13] cares for you if he ever cared he still
[1:01:16] cares if he ever chose you you're still
[1:01:18] chosen you're gonna make it you're gonna
[1:01:21] be there because he chose you you didn't
[1:01:24] choose him
[1:01:26] amen God's choosing
[1:01:30] he says it is the groom who decides and
[1:01:33] chooses a certain woman for his bride
[1:01:35] John 15 16 ye have not chosen me
[1:01:40] I have chosen you
[1:01:43] he says this choosing of the bride was
[1:01:46] purposed in himself Ephesians 1 and 9
[1:01:49] and in Romans 9 11 it says that the
[1:01:52] purpose of God according to election
[1:01:55] might stand you can't read it any other
[1:01:58] way the heart purpose now think about
[1:02:01] this for a minute the heart purpose the
[1:02:04] Eternal purpose of God was to take a
[1:02:06] bride of his own choosing
[1:02:09] what's all this about you you think he's
[1:02:13] going to let you fail you think he's
[1:02:15] going to let it come to him his word
[1:02:16] return unto him void all of this
[1:02:18] everything his heart purpose was that he
[1:02:20] would have a bride and he called you and
[1:02:22] he chose you and he's not going to let
[1:02:24] his heart purpose fail you're gonna make
[1:02:27] it you're gonna be there amen he says
[1:02:29] his own choosing and that purpose was in
[1:02:32] himself and being Eternal was decreed
[1:02:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:02:39] what is this telling you what is it that
[1:02:42] this is that this is saying before he
[1:02:44] created anything before there was even
[1:02:46] any any Stardust the bride you was
[1:02:49] already in his mind you were already
[1:02:52] there and that's where you get your
[1:02:55] Eternal qualities from how am I Eternal
[1:02:58] because you were in God before the
[1:03:01] foundation of the world as a thought
[1:03:03] which means you are a part of God which
[1:03:05] means you didn't have a beginning which
[1:03:07] means you won't have an ending you are
[1:03:10] an eternal attribute of God hell has a
[1:03:13] beginning so hell has an end but you
[1:03:16] never had a beginning and so you will
[1:03:18] never have an end you were with God
[1:03:20] before it started you'll be with God
[1:03:22] after it all ends and through the
[1:03:25] eternities you will be there because you
[1:03:27] were with him then amen you never had a
[1:03:31] beginning you were in the Eternal
[1:03:34] never-changing thoughts of almighty God
[1:03:36] and now you are a thought expressed
[1:03:42] what he thought
[1:03:45] is now here
[1:03:46] in flesh once again you are an expressed
[1:03:50] thought
[1:03:51] of almighty God
[1:03:53] what's that mean you have been made
[1:03:55] manifest in this day
[1:03:58] you can think about it you can think
[1:04:00] about building a house but it's just a
[1:04:03] thought until you build it and then your
[1:04:04] thoughts are expressed there it is
[1:04:06] there's what I had in my mind and he
[1:04:09] looks down in this day at a bride
[1:04:11] standing on the earth and he says there
[1:04:13] it is there's what I had in my mind and
[1:04:17] sometimes we don't think we're very much
[1:04:19] but I tell you there you are the
[1:04:21] expressed image of what God had in his
[1:04:24] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:04:26] cast down all those complexes of I'm
[1:04:29] nothing cast down all that I'm never
[1:04:31] going to be good enough cast down how am
[1:04:33] I going to make it I say how can you
[1:04:35] fail how can you not make it you're
[1:04:37] gonna be there because you are the very
[1:04:39] thoughts that was in the mind of God and
[1:04:42] his thoughts are not going to fail his
[1:04:44] thoughts are not going to return them to
[1:04:46] him void they are Eternal so what he
[1:04:49] thought must have eternal life amen
[1:04:53] you're manifested
[1:04:55] in this day
[1:04:58] he says he has never had a new thought
[1:05:00] about anything that is incredible if he
[1:05:03] loved you he loves you if he saw you
[1:05:06] there you're going to be there if he saw
[1:05:07] you healed you're healed saw you saved
[1:05:09] you're saved he's never had a new
[1:05:11] thought about anything because all his
[1:05:13] thoughts he has always had and always
[1:05:16] will have and knows the end from the
[1:05:18] beginning because he is God thus the
[1:05:20] thoughts of God are e
[1:05:23] eternal
[1:05:25] Moses
[1:05:27] Jeremiah John Peter William Branham
[1:05:32] you
[1:05:34] I don't deserve to be listed with a yes
[1:05:39] you do
[1:05:40] they were thoughts of God expressed
[1:05:43] and now you are a thought of God
[1:05:45] expressed
[1:05:47] they were thoughts of God manifested and
[1:05:50] now you are a thought of God
[1:05:53] manifested
[1:05:54] brother Brown says now it says that he
[1:05:57] had chosen Us in him before the
[1:05:59] foundation of the world that means that
[1:06:01] we were right there with him in the mind
[1:06:04] and thoughts of God before the
[1:06:06] foundation of the world that gives an
[1:06:08] eternal quality to the elect you can't
[1:06:11] get away from that I say thank you Lord
[1:06:14] I don't want to get away from him I'm
[1:06:16] thankful that I have an eternal quality
[1:06:18] about me amen you are just this kind of
[1:06:22] blows my mind even to say it but you're
[1:06:24] just as Eternal as God is eternal
[1:06:27] you're just as Eternal as God is eternal
[1:06:30] you didn't become a son or daughter of
[1:06:33] God when you came down to the altar you
[1:06:35] didn't become a son or daughter of God
[1:06:36] when you received the baptism of the
[1:06:38] Holy Ghost you always were a son or
[1:06:41] daughter of God you've always been a
[1:06:44] child of God what's that mean that means
[1:06:46] the devil never did on you the devil
[1:06:48] never did have a claim on you the devil
[1:06:50] never did have a chance to keep you from
[1:06:52] making it all those nights of Torment if
[1:06:54] you're not going to Rapture you're not
[1:06:55] gonna make it he was just trying to
[1:06:57] convince you with that because he can't
[1:06:59] stop the elect seed of God from
[1:07:01] manifesting what God thought they would
[1:07:03] be if he thought you'd Rapture you're
[1:07:04] gonna Rapture he's never had a claim on
[1:07:07] you he's never had a right to you you
[1:07:10] always have been a son or daughter of
[1:07:13] almighty God you never were an outcast
[1:07:16] you never were a failure
[1:07:19] come on somebody because he tells you
[1:07:21] that I know he does
[1:07:23] sure we've all fallen short
[1:07:27] like I tell people well I've fallen
[1:07:29] short and I don't measure up I say get
[1:07:30] in line
[1:07:32] because you just described every one of
[1:07:34] us you're not special I hope that didn't
[1:07:37] feed into your complex
[1:07:40] okay but some people want to be special
[1:07:42] by by Downing themselves so much and I'm
[1:07:44] this and I'm not no you're not you're
[1:07:46] just like a human like the rest of us
[1:07:49] but you're going to make it because
[1:07:50] you're an expressed thought of almighty
[1:07:52] God
[1:07:53] quit putting yourself down quit
[1:07:55] listening to the devil the word of God
[1:07:56] says you were there and that you will be
[1:07:59] there
[1:08:00] he says and that is exactly what we have
[1:08:02] been saying these we're talking about
[1:08:04] you who are the Royal seed or the elect
[1:08:08] of God are they predestinated foreknown
[1:08:11] of God and we're in the mind of God and
[1:08:14] His Thoughts in very plain language the
[1:08:17] true bride of Christ was in the mind of
[1:08:19] God eternally though not expressed until
[1:08:22] each came forth in the designated
[1:08:25] decreed season
[1:08:27] as each member came forth it became
[1:08:30] expressed so when William Branham came
[1:08:32] forth he became expressed
[1:08:35] okay when each messenger from each age
[1:08:37] came forth they became expressed when
[1:08:40] ireneas came forth he became expressed
[1:08:43] and took its place in the body
[1:08:46] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[1:08:50] word
[1:08:51] seed bride
[1:08:53] see we call the people
[1:08:57] who are his and and all the Believers we
[1:09:01] call it the body of Christ why why is
[1:09:04] that why do we say it's the body
[1:09:06] because she was predestinated in him
[1:09:09] came from the same source as him and
[1:09:13] it's just as Eternal with him
[1:09:16] and now this body is manifesting him on
[1:09:20] the earth in a many-membered body called
[1:09:23] The Bride so when we say that we are the
[1:09:25] body of the lord we mean it literally
[1:09:29] it is his expressed image once it was
[1:09:32] Jesus was the expressed image now this
[1:09:35] is the body that he is expressed in upon
[1:09:38] the Earth this is how people see him
[1:09:40] this is how the gospel is spread this is
[1:09:43] how the sick are healed this is how
[1:09:45] demons are cast out this is the body
[1:09:48] that he is using in order to manifest
[1:09:50] himself in this age it's through you
[1:09:53] it's through the bride body of our Lord
[1:09:56] Jesus
[1:10:00] what's that mean
[1:10:02] the Eternal logos
[1:10:05] God
[1:10:06] was manifested in the Sun
[1:10:09] so when Jesus dwelt the fullness of the
[1:10:13] godhead in a body
[1:10:15] okay so the father was manifested in
[1:10:18] flesh
[1:10:20] and being so he gained the title of son
[1:10:23] why was Jesus the son because the father
[1:10:26] was manifested in that flesh body do we
[1:10:29] understand that and so that gave him the
[1:10:31] title of son when the father manifested
[1:10:34] himself in a body he was called the son
[1:10:35] and when he manifest his thoughts today
[1:10:38] in flesh in a body then we also gain the
[1:10:41] same title we are Sons
[1:10:44] the exact same way Jesus says the exact
[1:10:46] same way you're a son because the father
[1:10:48] is manifested in your flesh that makes
[1:10:50] me a son that makes you a daughter
[1:10:53] the difference being and there is a
[1:10:55] difference is that all of God was in
[1:10:58] Jesus
[1:10:59] all of God was in that one body he was
[1:11:02] the fullness and we have him in measure
[1:11:05] in other words we have him in portion
[1:11:08] Jesus could walk around and he was God I
[1:11:11] walk around and God is in me
[1:11:15] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:11:16] because I have a portion I have a
[1:11:19] portion of him in me and that's why
[1:11:22] here's the thing though let's stop for a
[1:11:24] minute but if we add up all the portions
[1:11:28] if you add up all the portions of the
[1:11:31] Bride around then you gain the same
[1:11:33] fullness
[1:11:35] that was in Jesus
[1:11:36] but it's just separated into many
[1:11:39] different individuals
[1:11:42] says so we being Eternal in his thoughts
[1:11:46] in our turn and time those thoughts
[1:11:49] became manifested in the flesh
[1:11:52] and just like Jesus we are
[1:11:55] sons of God
[1:11:57] and like I said while ago because we're
[1:11:59] talking about portions of God a portion
[1:12:01] here and here and here and here and all
[1:12:03] the way around and then portions all the
[1:12:05] way around that's why we call it
[1:12:08] a body
[1:12:09] because it's the body that God has
[1:12:11] manifested in on the earth she is born
[1:12:14] of his bone
[1:12:16] she is flesh of his flesh she is his
[1:12:20] body
[1:12:21] that's very literal what it's saying
[1:12:23] here when we say we're the body of
[1:12:25] Christ we mean it
[1:12:28] is not terminology
[1:12:31] he says we did not become seed by the
[1:12:34] rebirth
[1:12:35] we were seed and therefore we were
[1:12:38] reborn for only the elect can be reborn
[1:12:42] think about that
[1:12:44] oh I I I I I got the new birth and so
[1:12:48] I'm elect no you were elect so you got
[1:12:50] the new birth
[1:12:52] because we were seed in other words let
[1:12:55] me put it like this because we were in
[1:12:57] his thoughts because we were Eternal
[1:12:59] because we never had a beginning
[1:13:02] is the reason we could be quickened
[1:13:04] because in non-seed there's nothing to
[1:13:07] Quicken
[1:13:09] there's no life of God in them that's
[1:13:14] why this message can cross their path
[1:13:16] and it can Flash in front of them and it
[1:13:18] doesn't Quicken nothing as a matter of
[1:13:19] fact they could care less
[1:13:22] because there's nothing there for it to
[1:13:24] Quicken but when it comes across the
[1:13:26] path of a sea Gene of God all of a
[1:13:28] sudden whoo
[1:13:30] there's something in there calling me
[1:13:32] there's something in there speaking to
[1:13:33] me why because that's their father
[1:13:35] speaking to them they recognize that
[1:13:38] voice and they say mama that's me that's
[1:13:41] me right there they recognize themselves
[1:13:42] and there's a deep that begins calling
[1:13:44] to the deep and there's that seed begins
[1:13:46] to come to life
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:50] I love how it says in our time
[1:13:53] manifesting the very very Eternal
[1:13:56] thoughts of God
[1:13:57] down in each age they would manifest his
[1:14:00] eternal thoughts and now it's your turn
[1:14:02] now it's your turn to manifest the
[1:14:04] thoughts of God for the layout of cnh
[1:14:06] when he said I will have a bride without
[1:14:08] spot or wrinkle somebody's got to
[1:14:09] manifest that
[1:14:11] when he said that there's going to be a
[1:14:12] Rapture there's going to be a body
[1:14:13] change there's going to be a marriage
[1:14:15] supper somebody's going to step into it
[1:14:17] and manifest that and that's what you
[1:14:19] have been called to do to manifest the
[1:14:21] very thoughts of God another way to
[1:14:24] illustrate this to show that you were
[1:14:26] always gods and always with God as we
[1:14:28] talk about redeemed we say I'm redeemed
[1:14:30] you know I'm redeemed thank God I'm
[1:14:32] redeemed but what does this mean
[1:14:35] when it says what is redemption
[1:14:39] redeem means to buy back
[1:14:42] redeemings to restore to the original
[1:14:45] owner
[1:14:46] so the only way God could redeem you is
[1:14:49] if God had you first
[1:14:51] the only way you can ever be redeemed is
[1:14:53] if you already belong to him
[1:14:56] he says God by his death the shed Blood
[1:14:58] Bought back his own
[1:15:01] he bought back the spoken word seed
[1:15:04] bride my sheep hear my voice the word
[1:15:08] and they follow me
[1:15:11] you always were a sheep
[1:15:16] you always worship but see there's the
[1:15:19] battle
[1:15:20] and I know each one of you face it
[1:15:22] because I faced it and I know this is
[1:15:23] how he attacks people the devil can't
[1:15:25] make you non-seed
[1:15:28] but he can try to keep you from
[1:15:30] recognizing that your seed
[1:15:33] he can try to keep you from recognizing
[1:15:35] who you are and he tries to convince you
[1:15:37] that you're not seed but eventually
[1:15:40] there comes a time when the voice of the
[1:15:42] father connects to the soul of the child
[1:15:45] and it connects to that seed and we
[1:15:47] become very very aware that that's my
[1:15:50] father talking to me
[1:15:52] when you read the message when you hear
[1:15:54] the message when it's preached you
[1:15:56] recognize that it's truth because no
[1:15:58] matter what the devil says that begins
[1:16:00] to connect and it begins to pull and you
[1:16:02] recognize that's who I am that's my home
[1:16:05] he's talking about and sometimes you
[1:16:07] almost get this strange feeling of of
[1:16:10] what's the word I'm looking for when you
[1:16:11] think you've been there before
[1:16:14] Deja Vu thank you
[1:16:16] not trying to spiritualize Deja Vu but
[1:16:19] every now and then when you hear about
[1:16:20] the Heavenly home and you hear about
[1:16:21] this and you hear about that and before
[1:16:23] the attorney and you almost get this
[1:16:25] strange feeling of just for a second you
[1:16:26] can almost see it just for a second you
[1:16:28] feel it just for a second you and the
[1:16:30] holy spirit moves to the place and just
[1:16:32] for a second
[1:16:34] like I was there
[1:16:36] and I want to tell you it's because you
[1:16:38] were
[1:16:39] it's because you've been there you've
[1:16:41] been with him you've been in the
[1:16:43] eternities and so it pulls you back it
[1:16:46] draws you back because that's the only
[1:16:48] place that this eternal see Gene of God
[1:16:51] will ever have peace will ever have
[1:16:53] comfort is when it's restored once
[1:16:54] you'll never have peace here you're not
[1:16:55] from here you'll never have peace and
[1:16:57] time you're not a time being this flesh
[1:17:00] is
[1:17:01] this flesh is a time being but that seed
[1:17:03] gene on the inside of you is not a time
[1:17:05] being and it longs to go back where it
[1:17:07] came from you begin to realize I was an
[1:17:11] eagle all along
[1:17:12] I never was what the devil told me I was
[1:17:14] brother Branham says a Son of God can go
[1:17:17] a long time before he recognizes that
[1:17:20] he's a son
[1:17:22] look that's why you don't give up on
[1:17:23] people when they're out there in drugs
[1:17:25] and they don't even believe and they
[1:17:26] don't this and then brother Branham says
[1:17:28] they can go a long time before they
[1:17:31] recognize because I said that's the
[1:17:32] battle the devil tries to keep you from
[1:17:35] recognizing who you are
[1:17:37] recognizing you're a son and he says you
[1:17:39] can go a long time before you recognize
[1:17:42] that you're a son and you begin to
[1:17:44] believe what they're telling you by they
[1:17:46] I mean the Devils you begin to believe
[1:17:48] maybe I am a chicken
[1:17:50] and You Begin eating on chicken things
[1:17:52] and doing
[1:17:53] I almost said chicken wings because it
[1:17:55] rhymed and
[1:17:58] doing chicken things and eating chicken
[1:18:00] things
[1:18:01] and living like chickens but you can't
[1:18:04] stay that way forever because you never
[1:18:05] were a chicken eventually the voice of
[1:18:08] the one searching for you is gonna he
[1:18:10] may cry out service after service after
[1:18:12] service but because you're an eagle you
[1:18:14] know how it is you've been there you've
[1:18:16] been there before when all of a sudden
[1:18:18] you recognize he's talking to me
[1:18:21] he's talking to me my father's talking
[1:18:24] and what it is is that eagle flying over
[1:18:25] that cage and for some of you it may not
[1:18:27] even be a cage of being lost some of you
[1:18:29] it may be a cage of sickness it may be a
[1:18:31] cage of depression it may be a cage of
[1:18:34] anxiety but that eagle can fly over
[1:18:36] saying you don't got to stay there pop
[1:18:38] Eagles here today and he's bringing a
[1:18:40] deliverance and something begins to
[1:18:41] connect maybe you hadn't gone all the
[1:18:43] way maybe you haven't been filled with
[1:18:45] the Holy Ghost maybe you haven't
[1:18:46] surrendered and you're starting to
[1:18:47] wonder am I an eagle or am I a chicken
[1:18:49] but tonight he's flying over and he's
[1:18:51] saying you is always an eagle you was
[1:18:53] always with me and maybe there's a fear
[1:18:55] inside of you like I don't know I don't
[1:18:57] if I try to fly what if I fail what if I
[1:19:00] mess up listen don't worry about it just
[1:19:02] set your wings one time just begin to
[1:19:04] Flap one time you were made for this but
[1:19:06] I've never flown before that's okay
[1:19:08] that's okay you were made to fly just
[1:19:11] set your wings one time because he's
[1:19:12] calling you tonight and he's saying you
[1:19:14] never were a chicken but you were always
[1:19:17] with me you've always been with me you
[1:19:19] are Eternal as I am Eternal and he's
[1:19:22] called calling you tonight because
[1:19:23] you're a c Gene of almighty God don't be
[1:19:27] afraid to respond to the call don't be
[1:19:29] afraid to fail so many people never try
[1:19:32] because they're afraid to fail
[1:19:35] you can't fail
[1:19:37] you can't fall because you belong to him
[1:19:40] and he's not going to let you
[1:19:42] fail
[1:19:45] adopted and placed and brother Branham
[1:19:47] Only Just Hits this for a second in this
[1:19:49] chapter and so we're going to be brief
[1:19:51] here
[1:19:52] what is the adoption and what is the
[1:19:54] placing
[1:19:55] brother Bradham says there it is
[1:19:58] Jesus Christ came forth died upon the
[1:20:01] cross and accomplished Redemption
[1:20:04] bought you back restoring to original
[1:20:07] owner by means of purchase or paying the
[1:20:09] price and thereby placed us
[1:20:13] if you're bought with the price you're
[1:20:16] placed either that or I can't read that
[1:20:18] right
[1:20:19] thereby placed us as Sons he did not
[1:20:22] make us Sons for we were already his
[1:20:25] sons but he placed us as Sons for as
[1:20:27] long as we were in the world in the
[1:20:30] flesh he could not recognize us as sons
[1:20:33] in other words you couldn't be
[1:20:36] adopted and placed as long as you were
[1:20:38] living in sin
[1:20:39] you couldn't be adopted in place while
[1:20:42] the devil held you captive
[1:20:45] okay but you were always a son you were
[1:20:48] a son all along even though he had to
[1:20:50] get Negative reports and say your son
[1:20:51] ain't living right your son ain't doing
[1:20:53] this your son is he couldn't place you
[1:20:57] because you were living in sin you were
[1:20:59] living in flesh okay you couldn't do
[1:21:02] those things
[1:21:04] and although you were a captive you were
[1:21:06] still a son
[1:21:08] but because you were a son
[1:21:11] God sent forth his Spirit into your
[1:21:13] heart whereby you cry Abba Father and
[1:21:18] being born again which we've covered
[1:21:20] what the new birth is
[1:21:21] being filled with the Holy Ghost filled
[1:21:24] with his spirit filled with his life
[1:21:26] eternal life you were no more a servant
[1:21:29] but a son and if a son then you are in
[1:21:32] heir to all things when am I placed when
[1:21:36] he puts the robe of the baptism of the
[1:21:38] Holy Ghost on your life he has accepted
[1:21:41] your life and he says this is listen
[1:21:45] Jesus there at the River Jordan what did
[1:21:47] he say this is my beloved Son
[1:21:52] he recognized him right there he filled
[1:21:54] him with the spirit right there and
[1:21:56] recognized brother branham's clear he
[1:21:59] didn't make us Sons we were already his
[1:22:01] sons but he placed as his sons for as
[1:22:03] long as we were in the world in the
[1:22:05] flesh we could not be recognized as his
[1:22:08] sons but when you come to the New Birth
[1:22:10] then he can recognize you and he can
[1:22:13] place you and adopt you as his sons in
[1:22:16] other words
[1:22:18] it's his way of you always were a son
[1:22:20] but now he can openly Proclaim it this
[1:22:23] is my son this is one that I have trust
[1:22:26] in this is listen if adoption's
[1:22:29] somewhere off in the future then how can
[1:22:31] we say we have checkbook Authority
[1:22:35] because the bride has checkbook
[1:22:36] Authority but as a son you don't get
[1:22:38] that until you're adopted and placed you
[1:22:41] don't have the authority of the father
[1:22:43] until you're adopted in place so if we
[1:22:45] haven't been adopted we don't have
[1:22:46] checkbook Authority
[1:22:48] but under the new birth you have
[1:22:50] received your adoption hearing the word
[1:22:54] for the age
[1:22:55] and we're about to bring this down to a
[1:22:57] close it says if you are true seed you
[1:22:59] will hear that word
[1:23:01] the spirit will baptize you into the
[1:23:04] body of Christ filling you and
[1:23:06] empowering you and you will receive the
[1:23:09] word for your day and age now listen
[1:23:12] he's putting it very closely with if
[1:23:15] you're a seed you will accept the
[1:23:17] message
[1:23:19] he says now we have been constantly
[1:23:21] saying now he's going to come back to
[1:23:22] the evidence of the Holy Ghost that the
[1:23:24] true evidence of being baptized with the
[1:23:26] Holy Ghost is for the believer to
[1:23:28] receive the word for the age in which he
[1:23:33] lives
[1:23:34] this is why brother Tim has made it very
[1:23:36] clear we're not word rejecters
[1:23:40] okay because they want to point back to
[1:23:42] Azusa Pentecost and say well that's just
[1:23:44] Pentecostal when they say that that's
[1:23:46] what they're referencing they're not
[1:23:47] referencing the book of Acts they're
[1:23:48] referencing the Azusa Street movement of
[1:23:50] the early 1900s but they were word
[1:23:52] rejecters they received the gifts but
[1:23:54] when the word came they said no we don't
[1:23:56] want that we don't want the ministry of
[1:23:58] Malachi 4 we just want the gifts brother
[1:24:00] Brown is making it very clear the true
[1:24:02] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[1:24:04] Ghost is the believer for the believer
[1:24:07] to receive the word for the age in which
[1:24:08] he lives
[1:24:10] let's make it clear again what we
[1:24:11] believe here you must receive the word
[1:24:14] it is the measuring line it is the
[1:24:16] measuring stick I want to drive this
[1:24:17] home we believe that with all of our
[1:24:20] heart that the revealed word of the hour
[1:24:23] must be accepted
[1:24:26] it must be accepted we're not built
[1:24:28] solely on Dynamics
[1:24:30] because to do that would be just as bad
[1:24:32] as being solely built on mechanics we
[1:24:35] believe in the Dynamics and we believe
[1:24:37] in the mechanics we must receive and
[1:24:40] believe the message of the hour
[1:24:43] but just as everything isn't based on
[1:24:46] experience everything also isn't based
[1:24:48] on saying I believe the message
[1:24:51] there's a lot of people that say I
[1:24:53] believe the message
[1:24:54] that don't live it
[1:24:56] that don't ever have an experience that
[1:24:58] don't never have the power they don't
[1:25:00] have those things although you must
[1:25:01] believe the message you must accept the
[1:25:05] word of the hour but there must be a
[1:25:07] balance in that what does it say here
[1:25:11] it says in every single age Bar None it
[1:25:14] says the very same thing in opening and
[1:25:17] closing the message to each age so as
[1:25:20] we've read and we'll continue to read
[1:25:21] the opening and closing to every age is
[1:25:24] exactly the same it'll say something
[1:25:25] like this unto thee messenger of
[1:25:29] and then it'll name whatever church it's
[1:25:30] writing a letter to or whatever in your
[1:25:33] church age it'll say these things saith
[1:25:36] he
[1:25:37] and then it'll go into it he that hath
[1:25:39] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:25:42] saith
[1:25:44] to the churches
[1:25:46] brother man says notice here that Jesus
[1:25:49] by the spirit in every age addresses
[1:25:51] himself to only one person relative to
[1:25:55] the word for that age in other words
[1:25:57] what's this mean he's not saying unto
[1:25:59] the four angels that I'm sending to Leia
[1:26:01] to see you or unto the four angels that
[1:26:03] I'm sending to Ephesus he says unto thee
[1:26:06] Angel there is one Messenger to each age
[1:26:11] he says only one person relative to the
[1:26:14] word for that age only one messenger for
[1:26:17] each age receives what the spirit has to
[1:26:19] say to that age and that one messenger
[1:26:24] is the messenger to the true church it
[1:26:28] goes like this Jesus speaks to the
[1:26:31] messenger the messenger speaks to the
[1:26:33] church now in so doing it's the true
[1:26:34] church and the false Church the false
[1:26:36] Church also will be held responsible for
[1:26:39] everything that the messenger brought
[1:26:40] they don't get let off the hook brother
[1:26:43] Brown says here I've already read that
[1:26:46] let me let me skip down here
[1:26:48] and this this goes back to why we say
[1:26:50] that you must when we've been saying
[1:26:52] this you must accept the word for our
[1:26:56] age because in every Church age God
[1:26:59] speaks to an angel he addresses One
[1:27:01] messenger he speaks to the church by way
[1:27:04] of that messenger
[1:27:05] and so let's just bring it down like
[1:27:07] this if God is speaking to us by way of
[1:27:10] the messenger and we reject that message
[1:27:13] we are directly rejecting what God is
[1:27:16] saying to us
[1:27:17] okay it is a direct rejection of what
[1:27:21] God is saying to us so so if you're
[1:27:23] going to hear from God in this age or
[1:27:26] any age it's going to be from a
[1:27:29] messenger
[1:27:30] it's gonna be through a message that's
[1:27:32] how God speaks he directs it there every
[1:27:35] age to the angel right to the messenger
[1:27:38] right it's very direct and they're the
[1:27:41] ones so so when brother Branham says
[1:27:43] that the evidence of the holy spirit in
[1:27:46] your life is receiving the word for your
[1:27:49] age this is where he's getting it from
[1:27:51] because you can't say you have God in
[1:27:54] your heart and then reject the very
[1:27:56] thing that he's saying to you
[1:27:59] so if you have the Holy Spirit you will
[1:28:01] receive the message for the day you
[1:28:04] can't have say that you have the one who
[1:28:06] wrote the word and spoke the word in
[1:28:08] your life
[1:28:09] and then reject the word that he sends
[1:28:11] on your path
[1:28:13] listen it's not going to be the only
[1:28:15] fruit well I believe the message you've
[1:28:17] got of course there's going to be other
[1:28:18] fruits of course there's going to be
[1:28:20] Supernatural of course there's there's
[1:28:21] going to be experiences and those other
[1:28:24] things but you will accept the message
[1:28:26] you will believe the word for your day
[1:28:28] you will accept
[1:28:31] the word
[1:28:33] hearing the word
[1:28:35] for the for the age and what we're
[1:28:38] talking about is one messenger and it's
[1:28:40] a pattern
[1:28:41] that was set by Paul brother Brown says
[1:28:44] in every age we have exactly the same
[1:28:46] pattern we've talked a lot about
[1:28:47] patterns that is why the light comes
[1:28:50] through some god-given messenger in a
[1:28:54] certain area and then from that
[1:28:56] messenger there spreads the light
[1:28:58] through the ministry of others who have
[1:29:00] been Faithfully
[1:29:01] taught and like I said we talked about
[1:29:04] patterns and we see that that Paul was
[1:29:06] the messenger in his day because we
[1:29:08] actually see him have confrontations
[1:29:10] with other Apostles where it is
[1:29:13] established that Paul alone had the full
[1:29:16] Revelation for that day
[1:29:18] and it is imperative brother Branham
[1:29:21] says that we stay with the messenger and
[1:29:23] say what he said and in the spirit of
[1:29:27] how he said it he says they add here or
[1:29:30] take away there and soon the message is
[1:29:32] no longer pure and the Revival dies down
[1:29:35] how careful we must be to hear one voice
[1:29:37] for the spirit has but one voice which
[1:29:40] is the voice of God Paul warned them to
[1:29:43] say what he said even as Peter did
[1:29:46] likewise and something he says
[1:29:50] he says let me read this next quote and
[1:29:52] I'll come back to it he says oh how
[1:29:53] important it is to hear the voice of God
[1:29:56] by way of his Messengers and then say
[1:29:59] what was has been given to say to the
[1:30:03] churches and I think it's very important
[1:30:04] that not only do we say it
[1:30:07] but we say it in the same spirit
[1:30:10] and that's one thing I found early in my
[1:30:12] Ministry I didn't do this
[1:30:13] I would search and I would find a quote
[1:30:15] maybe that went along with or as I
[1:30:18] studied and I would put that in my
[1:30:19] sermon and use it or whatever
[1:30:21] and I would always say it exactly
[1:30:24] word for word what brother Branham said
[1:30:26] but then one time just in conversation I
[1:30:29] was asking brother Danny steaming some
[1:30:30] questions here and there and he said
[1:30:31] it's always very important before you
[1:30:33] use a quote to listen to the quote
[1:30:37] he said because sometimes we'll take
[1:30:39] that quote and we're reading it and
[1:30:41] we're fireballing brother Brown I'm said
[1:30:43] and the way you say it completely
[1:30:45] changes what's being said he said it may
[1:30:47] be brother Branham saying a prayer
[1:30:51] because you can say lots of things and
[1:30:54] your tone matters and the spirit of the
[1:30:57] way you say it matters and so it's very
[1:31:00] important as as ministers or even you in
[1:31:03] your own study if you find a quote that
[1:31:04] just really stands out just click on it
[1:31:06] and play it see how it was delivered see
[1:31:09] the spirit of it see the tone of it see
[1:31:11] see the context of it don't just cut
[1:31:13] that out but read the paragraph before
[1:31:15] in the paragraph after let it be placed
[1:31:18] in the spirit in which it was given
[1:31:21] and we come to our last slide of the
[1:31:24] night
[1:31:25] the last thing that he says at the end
[1:31:27] of every age
[1:31:28] he that hath an ear
[1:31:31] he says if you are a Christian you will
[1:31:34] get back to what the spirit is teaching
[1:31:36] that is the word of this age every fresh
[1:31:40] and true Revival will be because men
[1:31:42] have gotten back to the word for their
[1:31:45] age if you are a true seed if you are
[1:31:50] truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you
[1:31:52] will esteem his word above your
[1:31:54] necessary meat and yearn to live by
[1:31:58] every word that precedes out of the
[1:32:02] mouth of God
[1:32:04] churches we leave here tonight I leave
[1:32:06] with rejoicing and Thanksgiving in my
[1:32:08] heart knowing that I have an ear to hear
[1:32:10] I'm thankful that I have an ear I'm
[1:32:12] thankful that I am Eternal I'm thankful
[1:32:14] that he sent a prophet and revealed to
[1:32:16] us that that before the world even
[1:32:18] existed you already were when the world
[1:32:21] ends you will be because you are an
[1:32:24] eternal seed Gene of God that's why hell
[1:32:26] can't be Eternal it had a beginning but
[1:32:28] that's why you can be Eternal is you
[1:32:31] never did have a beginning
[1:32:34] young people check your experience by
[1:32:37] the word live by the word don't don't
[1:32:40] listen don't think of the word
[1:32:43] or the message or even the things that
[1:32:45] Prophet brought as old-fashioned or out
[1:32:47] of date it's the message for this hour
[1:32:51] this isn't the message of Ephesus that
[1:32:52] we believe and follow this isn't the
[1:32:55] message of Smyrna or pergamism this is
[1:32:57] the message
[1:32:58] for laodicea he sent a prophet telling
[1:33:01] you this is up to date this is what God
[1:33:04] thinks now
[1:33:06] so we have to cast down this this human
[1:33:09] thinking I I used to get so tickled with
[1:33:12] middle schoolers and I see it even
[1:33:13] sometimes with my own kids
[1:33:16] but how quick things come and go
[1:33:19] like something could be cool a week ago
[1:33:22] and then one of your friends says it
[1:33:24] like seven days later it's like oh my
[1:33:26] goodness you that was so last week
[1:33:29] that was so four hours ago
[1:33:32] and things just all of a sudden become
[1:33:34] uncool because somebody decided it was
[1:33:37] have you ever thought about that the
[1:33:39] things that we think is cool and great
[1:33:41] is because somebody decided it was why
[1:33:44] do you think they're called influencers
[1:33:46] they influence what you think that's the
[1:33:49] whole point of it they don't even hide
[1:33:50] what they're trying to do and it used to
[1:33:52] is this big thing oh you got to be
[1:33:53] careful those commercials they'll
[1:33:54] influence you and now they're out there
[1:33:56] going hey I'm trying to influence you go
[1:33:59] do this this is awesome you will be cool
[1:34:02] if you do it
[1:34:04] and we just everything listen that's not
[1:34:06] how God is God doesn't change
[1:34:09] if he said it yesterday it's awesome
[1:34:11] yesterday and it's awesome today and
[1:34:13] it'll be awesome tomorrow if he loved
[1:34:15] you yesterday he loves you today and
[1:34:16] he'll love you tomorrow and you're going
[1:34:18] to make it because he said that you were
[1:34:21] part of him that you were called and it
[1:34:23] didn't change it didn't become uncool
[1:34:25] this message isn't Uncle it's the word
[1:34:26] that's going to take you in a rapture so
[1:34:29] cast down that thinking of of this is
[1:34:31] old-fashioned or this is outdated and I
[1:34:33] love what he says right here if you're
[1:34:34] true seed
[1:34:35] you will esteem his word above your
[1:34:37] necessary meat so you won't read
[1:34:39] something and go oh man why can't we do
[1:34:42] that
[1:34:44] oh man I don't understand why I'm not
[1:34:46] allowed to oh man why is that wrong
[1:34:48] you'll read his word and go if that's
[1:34:50] his word that's what I want to be if
[1:34:52] that's his word it don't matter if I
[1:34:54] don't that's how I'm going to live
[1:34:55] because your seed of God and he's coming
[1:34:57] back for people who are bone of his bone
[1:34:59] flesh of his flesh how can a member of
[1:35:01] his body not agree with him
[1:35:04] you are his body
[1:35:06] you must be in agreeance you must esteem
[1:35:09] his word
[1:35:10] it's not outdated it's what God spoke
[1:35:13] for this age and I end with this
[1:35:15] scripture we've already read it though
[1:35:17] it says and in them is fulfilled the
[1:35:19] prophecy of Isaiah saith by hearing you
[1:35:22] shall hear and shall not understand and
[1:35:24] seeing you shall see and shall not
[1:35:27] perceive for this people's heart is wax
[1:35:29] gross and their ears are dull of hearing
[1:35:31] and their eyes have been closed lest at
[1:35:33] any time they should see with their eyes
[1:35:35] and hear with their ears and should
[1:35:37] understand what their heart and should
[1:35:38] be converted and I should heal them but
[1:35:42] blessed are your eyes
[1:35:45] for they see and your ears for they hear
[1:35:49] for verily I say unto you that many
[1:35:51] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:35:54] to see those things which you see and
[1:35:57] have not seen them and to hear those
[1:35:59] things which you hear
[1:36:01] and have not heard them
[1:36:03] but praise God tonight
[1:36:05] he's opened your ears he sent a prophet
[1:36:08] in this day and because you are his your
[1:36:11] ears are open to receive can you stand
[1:36:13] together with me in this Bower heads

[1:36:54] that eagle flew over the chicken coop
[1:36:56] and screamed out the other chickens
